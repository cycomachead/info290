a
phenomenal
flavor
completely
unexpected
after
the
noise
great
mouthfeel
and
a
rich
dark
amber
color
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
have
not
tried
many
barleywine
ales
and
certainly
none
with
any
significant
age
im
going
to
pick
up
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
for
the
cellar
and
see
how
they
do
over
time
ill
be
looking
for
the
hop
bitterness
to
fade
and
the
malts
to
shine
ill
let
you
know
in
a
year
how
things
turn
out
overall
2011
and
drinking
well
a
bit
of
an
odd
flavour
in
the
aftertaste
maybe
a
touch
too
sweet
but
indulgent
o
a
wonderful
fluid
if
this
was
not
9
5
abv
i
could
drink
it
all
night
dunno
if
the
aging
helped
it
it
is
more
malty
than
most
barleywines
i
have
had
but
i
sure
enjoyed
it
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
some
time
overall
a
nice
barleywine
the
time
has
done
it
well
a
nice
barleywine
here
different
than
the
conventional
english
versions
this
is
a
blonde
beer
which
threw
me
off
on
the
pour
a
bit
cloudy
and
boasting
a
tall
and
lasting
inch
of
white
head
the
nose
on
it
is
surprisingly
hoppy
too
especially
in
the
context
of
other
middle
ages
beers
which
tend
not
to
be
the
most
aggressively
hopped
ales
around
wheat
malt
warming
booze
candy
sugar
and
a
pleasantly
complex
and
bright
strain
of
ale
yeast
it
opens
up
a
lot
as
it
warms
and
the
sweetness
is
only
for
a
second
before
hop
bitterness
takes
over
the
interplay
between
yeast
and
hops
here
is
extraordinary
the
alcohol
flavors
come
across
a
little
strong
though
and
slow
this
beers
drinkability
even
for
a
barleywine
a
bomber
of
this
is
a
few
ounces
too
much
really
at
least
for
me
still
the
happy
carbonation
and
lighter
body
for
the
style
make
it
a
really
unique
brew
good
stuff
here
from
middle
ages
oa
decent
barleywine
one
of
the
better
beers
made
by
middle
ages
overall
seems
an
entrylevel
barleywine
as
i
imagined
it
was
but
except
for
the
odd
butteryness
its
appropriate
for
the
style
and
well
done
just
not
mindblowing
this
beer
is
good
but
in
my
opinion
needs
some
work
the
malt
character
is
there
but
the
hops
are
a
bit
strange
or
unbalanced
the
citrus
notes
do
not
sit
as
well
as
they
should
with
the
malt
character
as
a
fan
of
barleywines
i
will
still
recommend
this
as
a
beer
thats
worth
a
try
but
i
would
view
it
more
as
a
dipa
or
strong
ale
than
as
a
barleywine
22oz
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
pours
a
caramel
hue
with
a
semihazy
clarity
and
a
half
inch
loose
creamcolored
head
that
eventually
disperses
into
a
creamy
slick
some
lacing
but
no
adhesion
nose
expresses
prunes
a
slightly
vinous
character
toasted
malt
and
a
trace
of
wet
cardboard
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
a
bit
more
subdued
theres
also
a
light
earthy
hoppiness
and
some
ethanol
however
things
are
a
bit
muddled
by
the
carbonation
levels
it
definitely
needs
a
swirl
to
open
it
up
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
but
closer
to
light
with
an
overly
assertive
carbonation
level
and
a
slightly
oily
texture
overall
a
fairly
mediocre
example
of
the
style
not
something
i
need
to
revisit
again
anytime
soon
o
the
high
abv
is
hidden
very
well
on
this
one
it
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
first
half
but
the
second
was
much
harder
because
of
the
bitterness
it
was
actually
hard
to
finish
not
a
beer
i
would
visit
again
in
its
current
state
of
maturity
perhaps
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
to
bypass
the
adolescent
wildness
that
this
brew
has
created
will
do
some
good
for
it
i
do
enjoy
a
good
ipa
double
ipa
etc
but
i
dont
want
my
barleywine
to
be
this
bitter
i
think
some
extra
belgian
candy
sugar
or
something
would
have
helped
to
balance
this
out
or
maybe
this
is
just
too
young
for
my
preference
maybe
i
will
pick
up
another
bottle
to
put
away
for
some
time
o
not
bad
a
decent
beer
overall
i
cant
say
this
strikes
me
as
a
particularly
aggressive
barleywine
its
more
of
a
belgian
ipa
than
a
barleywine
during
the
course
of
a
22ouncer
i
got
accustomed
to
the
taste
if
youre
looking
for
an
easydrinking
brew
that
packs
a
decent
punch
and
doesnt
particularly
tax
the
palate
this
is
a
good
choice
although
a
bit
pricey
a
solid
ba
overall
o
pretty
typical
decent
hoppy
barleywine
heavy
and
strong
heavy
raisin
and
grape
quite
fruity
overall
i
love
me
a
nice
hoppy
barleywine
and
this
one
is
tasty
almost
like
a
clone
of
backburner
from
southern
tier
which
i
also
enjoyed
thoroughly
great
beer
overall
a
quality
barleywine
with
a
solid
malt
base
and
enough
hops
to
give
it
enough
charecter
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
the
nose
needs
a
little
more
pep
to
move
this
one
up
a
class
but
the
feel
is
good
and
the
flavor
is
there
and
in
all
the
right
places
worth
checking
out
if
you
see
it
and
one
ill
probably
be
on
the
lookout
for
when
on
holiday
in
the
states
thanks
again
for
this
one
irishgurl4
this
was
a
smooth
unaggressive
barley
wine
very
nicely
done
fuller
medium
body
nicely
carbonated
sticky
and
chewy
on
the
tongue
with
a
bit
of
creaminess
this
is
a
nice
hoppy
barleywine
id
drink
it
again
overall
i
really
have
to
say
that
this
is
one
the
easiestdrinking
fullbodied
beers
ive
had
to
date
and
the
rather
high
abv
coupled
with
the
complex
character
and
drinkability
makes
this
one
a
dangerous
indulgence
hats
off
to
middle
ages
once
again
od
overly
sweet
with
not
enough
dark
fruit
character
well
hopped
but
could
use
less
booze
ok
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
pretty
decent
and
drinkable
beer
of
the
style
but
the
malty
barleywine
characteristics
just
didnt
really
stand
out
to
me
it
was
good
but
just
not
a
beer
that
really
stood
out
in
the
style
for
me
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
dryer
then
most
barleywines
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
1
inch
fizzy
beige
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
thin
broken
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
brown
sugar
alcohol
and
some
citrus
zest
taste
is
of
biscuitlike
malt
alcohol
and
some
pine
and
citrus
zest
hops
mild
hop
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
slightly
fizzy
carbonation
level
with
a
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
hopforward
barleywine
from
middle
ages
lots
of
pine
and
citrus
zest
nicely
balanced
with
the
malt
drink
pretty
tasty
a
more
malt
forward
with
a
little
over
bitter
more
smooth
and
big
than
some
bws
lately
a
nice
balance
between
the
flavors
an
overall
delicious
beer
that
i
somehow
want
to
find
flaw
in
the
butterybutterscotch
flavor
but
without
that
this
beer
would
be
quite
banal
o
its
not
too
bad
not
as
good
as
i
remember
it
being
when
my
buddy
let
me
have
a
sip
of
it
certainly
filling
and
not
a
bad
taste
but
i
cant
see
myself
paying
this
much
for
what
i
get
thankfully
this
round
was
a
gift
overall
while
the
first
sip
of
this
beer
was
excellent
subsequent
sips
lost
the
initial
potency
and
deliciousness
of
the
sugars
resulting
in
an
imbalanced
beverage
middle
ages
the
brewer
does
note
that
when
young
the
beer
is
quite
hoppy
and
the
malts
become
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
ages
perhaps
this
one
is
a
good
cellaring
beer
then
o
simply
delicious
the
craft
beer
i
cut
my
teeth
on
and
one
that
i
will
go
back
for
over
and
over
again
the
9
5
alcohol
adds
to
the
fun
but
its
the
complexity
of
the
flavor
profile
that
makes
this
beer
one
of
my
favorites
if
there
was
a
barleywine
that
was
a
summer
beer
this
would
be
it
smooth
and
citrusy
not
overly
complex
if
it
wasnt
for
the
high
abv
i
could
drink
these
all
day
i
can
finally
expunge
this
one
from
my
wants
list
after
it
had
been
on
there
for
years
thanks

i
enjoy
the
way
this
one
comes
together
i
could
sit
and
sip
on
this
all
night
cheers
to
my
first
real
beer
that
has
been
in
need
of
a
review
for
several
years
now
overall
the
bitter
finish
is
way
too
overpowering
i
would
like
a
little
bit
more
balance
from
this
beer
i
dont
think
im
going
to
try
to
find
it
again
the
reveal
middle
ages
druid
fluid
barleywine
going
with
the
trend
ive
noticed
from
this
brewery
its
a
bit
underwhelming
for
the
style
im
enjoying
the
beer
and
its
well
constructed
but
id
consider
it
more
an
ipa
or
ryepa
even
the
mouthfeel
on
this
is
lush
smooth
and
very
creamy
among
the
best
ive
found
it
almost
feels
good
to
drink
just
shy
of
10
abv
this
beer
is
still
very
drinkable
dn
wow
this
is
an
excellent
american
barley
wine
simple
yet
very
flavorful
balanced
just
right
i
will
seek
more
of
this
iso
druid
fluid
so
not
attempt
to
gargle
apparently
it
foams
got
awkward
when
carl
tried
to
gargle
it
its
hard
to
gargle
foam
he
says
d
this
is
an
okay
barleywine
it
definitely
leans
toward
the
sweeter
side
of
the
spectrum
thanks
to
given2flybrewing
for
sharing
drinkability
is
ok
some
warming
and
tingly
booze
take
away
a
bit
and
it
is
on
the
sweet
side
but
very
tolerable
on
that
end
a
very
slight
stickiness
on
the
finish
but
that
is
very
good
compared
to
most
barleywines
pours
murky

really
glad
i
got
to
try
it
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
orangeylite
caramel
brown
had
a
thin
dirty
white
head
that
clung
slightly
with
small
streams
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
aroma
was
overly
sweet
slightly
hoppy
and
slighty
fruity
taste
was
hoppy
up
front
slight
bitterness
with
some
sweetness
to
finish
mellowed
out
over
time
became
balanced
as
the
beer
warmed
up
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
coated
nicely
and
well
carbonated
alcohol
was
slightly
hidden
which
was
nice
and
it
was
pleasant
to
drink
d
im
not
at
all
impressed
with
this
beer
being
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
it
im
hoping
its
a
skunky
bottle
if
not
this
isnt
something
id
expect
from
middle
ages
o
for
the
price
there
are
other
beers
id
rather
buy
its
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
and
as
im
not
a
hophead
i
dont
think
id
care
to
buy
this
one
again
nor
recommend
for
the
style
smells
of
candy
and
sugar
very
sweet
less
hoppy
aroma
yet
a
stronger
alcohol
scent
tastes
of
dried
apricots
and
burnt
caramel
very
buttery
this
brew
is
rather
dry
to
the
pallet
clean
finish
but
not
much
residue
on
the
ol
taste
buds
good
beer
ot
great

worth
a
try

clear

the

is

by
a

hops
then
honey

some

makes
me
think
of
lemoncello

mango

come
out
as
it
breathes
finish
is
fairly
long
and
resiny
still
tasting
pine
several
minutes
later
mouthfeel
is
viscous
carbonation
on
the
high
end
but
it
is
soft
and
not
overbearing
alcohol
mildly
apparent
but
blends
well
with
everything
else
so
it
is
not
offensive
overall
an
awesome
brew
very
enjoyable
i
didnt
love
it
but
ill
probably
pick
up
another
bottle
next
time
im
in
syracuse
d
very
nice
not
sure
if
it
is
a
new
favorite
for
the
style
but
still
very
enjoyable
going
to
get
some
cheese
to
pair
and
enjoy
the
hell
out
of
it
d
a
pretty
nice
american
barleywine
pretty
fruitforward
profile
which
is
pretty
nice
notes
a
bizarre
barleywine
not
what
i
would
look
for
typically
in
the
style
but
a
very
enjoyable
brew
in
its
own
right
for
a
us
version
it
sure
is
hoppy
but
here
a
fruity
note
predominates
and
in
a
way
that
makes
it
rather
drinkable
all
in
all
this
brew
is
not
that
great
if
you
enjoy
very
hoppy
beers
then
definitely
try
this
brew
once
any
more
than
that
is
not
necessary
not
for
me
d
an
enjoyable
offering
from
middle
ages
a
very
underrated
brewery
but
far
from
their
best
and
far
from
a
top
tier
barleywine
definately
was
not
a
struggle
to
finish
but
im
not
sure
this
is
one
i
would
recommend
or
seek
out
given
the
great
array
of
american
and
english
barleywines
available
overall
a
good
baseline
barleywine
that
presents
a
balanced
example
of
the
american
style
got
this
22
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
with
aerozppl
pours
a
very
hazy
amberruby
color
with
a
nice
off
white
colored
head
it
sticks
around
for
a
little
while
but
settles
nicely
leaving
some
nice
lacing
as
it
quietly
recedes
smells
sweet
with
a
heavy
dose
of
caramel
also
some
piney
hops
help
balance
it
out
there
is
some
sort
of
staleness
lurking
back
there
cant
really
tell
what
it
is
but
its
there
i
think
it
might
be
a
touch
to
cold
the
first
couple
of
sips
reveal
some
nice
malty
sweetness
and
a
good
dose
of
piney
bitter
hops
i
think
its
a
nice
balance
between
the
two
im
getting
quite
a
bit
of
diactyl
almost
sort
of
buttery
its
slightly
off
putting
also
a
nice
touch
of
alcohol
i
think
the
carbonation
level
is
spot
on
and
it
has
a
slightly
creamy
feel
this
would
have
been
a
very
good
beer
if
not
for
those
slightly
off
flavors
maybe
one
day
i
can
give
it
another
shot
had
to
post
some
spinal
tap
for
this
one
3
53
533
53
5
sure
its
very
drinkable
but
for
me
personally
i
dont
see
the
point
maybe
my
expectations
where
just
too
high
but
im
letdown
by
this
one
perhaps
another
couple
years
will
help
balance
this
one
out
more
but
its
still
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
compared
to
just
about
all
the
other
brews
that
night
this
one
stands
out
for
the
strength
of
the
hops
still
remaining
lots
of
citrus
in
the
nose
and
taste
lemons
oranges
grapefruit
rind
pine
resin
grassy
all
balanced
by
a
sticky
sweet
caramel
backing
that
tries
hard
and
probably
fails
a
little
to
keep
up
to
the
hops
and
the
alcohol
bite
in
the
back
this
almost
feels
like
it
falls
into
dipa
territory
for
a
couple
of
years
on
it
its
a
nice
surprise
and
lets
me
know
it
could
take
a
few
more
fine
delicious
though
ultimately
a
little
unbalanced
tasty
though
d
it
doesnt
have
the
malt
or
the
hops
due
to
aging
to
back
up
the
alcohol
in
this
beast
ruby
red
body
with
a
decent
enough
head
things
start
to
go
downhill
with
the
smell
which
combines
a
highly
artificial
candylike
aroma
with
citrus
hops
the
flavor
profile
is
similar
with
the
hops
barely
balancing
out
the
rather
gross
candy
flavors
needless
to
say
this
was
a
huge
disappointment
probably
the
worst
barleywine
ive
ever
had
d
high
this
is
a
fine
barleywine
with
a
dynamic
well
mixed
flavor
id
order
another
and
buy
again
overall
solid
above
average
barleywine
could
have
used
a
lot
more
complexity
as
nothing
in
this
beer
challenged
the
palate
still
not
too
shabby
for
an
every
day
beer
i
think
this
should
be
a
little
dryer
to
get
the
mouthfeel
right
and
the
juicyhop
addition
whatever
it
is
clashes
with
the
pine
couldve
been
a
nice
and
clean
american
barleywine
but
its
a
weird
britishamerican
mixture
good
flavor
all
around
tho
i
think
i
just
have
creative
differences
of
the
3
barleywines
i
bought
the
other
day
this
is
my
favorite
drinkability
very
drinkable
for
its
high
content
it
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
very
complex
flavor
i
recommend
at
least
one
try
of
my
hometown
brew
overall
first
barleywine
so
nothing
to
compare
it
too
but
it
is
quite
balanced
between
the
malt
bitter
and
floral
backbone
would
love
to
see
how
this
would
do
with
some
age
drinkability
id
like
to
try
this
again
in
the
future
especially
for
the
5
or
6
price
tag
but
based
on
this
experience
i
wouldnt
rush
out
to
get
it
still
looking
to
try
more
middle
ages
beers
which
should
be
fairly
easy
now
based
on
my
location
pretty
good
barleywine
very
well
balanced
and
drinkable
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
american
bwines
on
the
whole
they
tend
to
be
too
hoppy
for
me
i
like
mine
sweeter
like
the
english
style
but
this
one
might
be
my
favorite
to
date
poured
reddish
burgundy
in
appearance
a
tranquil
head
topped
off
by
some
foamy
lacing
big
hops
on
the
scent
and
i
thought
this
is
going
to
be
quite
bitter
but
to
the
contrary
while
the
hops
were
present
they
took
a
backdoor
to
the
fruity
sweetness
augmenting
the
malt
bomb
i
could
taste
their
effects
but
they
were
super
smooth
and
the
result
was
very
drinkable
almost
like
mirror
mirrors
little
brother
from
the
sample
of
that
i
had
before
its
not
the
biggest
or
most
amazing
barleywine
but
was
quite
balanced
for
me
and
balance
while
still
retaining
flavor
is
what
i
look
for
in
these
beers
d
putting
more
than
one
of
these
down
would
be
tough
not
to
mention
how
toasted
one
would
be
not
very
drinkable
but
it
does
go
down
bravo
middle
ages
thanks
alot
joe
drinkability
is
good
this
is
tasty
and
rich
but
smooth
and
not
overwhelming
im
really
digging
it
and
am
glad
i
busted
it
out
after
an
epic
blue
bird
day
skiing
the
glacier
on
mt
hood
d
a
pretty
tasty
beer
in
a
highly
liked
category
d
very
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
strength
that
it
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
22
oz
bomber
with
no
freshness
date
the
beer
has
a
lightlycarbonated
amber
body
topped
with
a
loose
two
finger
head
that
leaves
bits
of
lace
on
the
nose
my
first
impression
is
cascade
and
simcoe
with
some
crystal
malts
later
this
evolves
into
tropical
and
citrus
fruits
and
perhaps
some
berries
it
is
nice
and
aromatic
but
consists
mostly
of
hops
and
various
alcohol
notes
big
floralleafy
hop
presence
on
the
palate
with
chewy
malts
fruity
esters
rosy
alcohol
and
lots
of
citric
bitterness
eventually
the
hops
ebb
and
make
way
for
lots
of
sweet
crystal
malts
and
a
pleasant
warming
sensation
the
body
is
chewy
lightlynumbing
and
gets
dryer
the
more
i
drink
this
is
definitely
a
brew
that
will
improve
with
age
but
as
is
its
not
a
great
one
not
bad
by
any
means
its
just
the
fruity
alcohols
and
esters
havent
melded
completely
with
the
big
hoppiness
and
chewy
sweetness
id
like
to
try
this
one
at
two
or
three
years
of
age
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
amber
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
the
smell
on
this
one
is
very
interesting
its
got
dark
fruits
and
bubblegum
with
a
slight
hop
scent
and
a
lot
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
about
the
same
as
the
smell
the
bubblegum
and
fruit
are
the
strongest
and
are
only
overshadowed
by
the
alcohol
there
is
a
slight
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
but
again
masked
by
the
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
hot
drinkability
on
this
one
is
poor
because
its
so
hot
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
i
cant
tell
if
aging
would
improve
this
perhaps
the
abv
would
cool
down
some
drinkability
very
well
balanced
between
the
malt
the
fruit
and
the
bitterness
with
a
thinner
body
than
would
be
expected
this
bottle
has
a
year
or
two
of
age
on
it
and
is
drinking
nicely
its
not
a
barleywine
in
the
classic
sense
however
notes
it
seems
like
the
hoppier
middle
ages
brews
are
exponentially
better
than
their
notsohoppy
brews
i
dont
know
if
its
just
me
but
wailing
wench
x
and
this
were
great
and
the
rest
of
their
lineup
has
been
just
okay
d
very
nice
but
it
feels
like
this
beer
could
be
so
much
better
i
need
to
try
and
age
some
more
longer
then
a
year
d
pretty
damned
drinkable
for
the
style
and
abv
this
is
a
solid
barleywine
fo
sho
really
digging
it
the
smell
is
the
show
stopper
here
i
will
have
to
trade
for
this
to
get
a
couple
of
bottles
for
the
cellar
this
beer
is
great
this
brew
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
big
offwhite
head
that
dies
down
to
a
solid
cover
and
modest
lacing
it
smells
like
a
smooth
piney
hop
and
malt
blend
with
a
touch
of
lavender
sweetness
very
pleasant
the
taste
is
a
deep
barley
and
caramel
sweetness
with
plenty
of
alcohol
warmth
it
has
a
fine
tingly
carbonation
that
forces
a
slow
flow
down
the
old
gullet
very
tangy
it
has
a
somewhat
oily
consistency
yet
it
also
has
a
certain
lightness
for
a
barleywine
it
has
a
tart
overtone
almost
a
grapfruitcherry
quality
pretty
drinkable
very
decent
this
is
my
first
barleywine
poured
a
beautiful
opaque
copper
orange
with
a
white
2
finger
head
which
maintains
good
retention
leaves
intermittent
speckles
of
lacing
on
the
inside
of
my
goblet
its
gorgeous
it
looks
like
cider
said
the
wife
aroma
is
malty
with
citrus
orange
apple
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thick
chewy
and
slippery
with
medium
carbonation
that
goes
well
with
the
mediumfull
body
taste
is
strongly
of
malt
with
a
little
hop
bitterness
and
a
fruity
peach
and
apple
background
even
with
the
high
abv
and
big
flavor
of
this
beer
it
has
high
drinkability
for
me
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
i
may
cellar
a
bottle
to
compare
next
year
overall
i
thought
this
was
very
good
very
different
for
the
style
and
something
that
i
thought
was
well
sought
for
i
would
have
no
issue
trying
this
one
again
in
fact
i
would
actually
try
and
seek
it
out
an
american
bwine
with
more
malth
than
hops
wow
this
thing
had
some
serious
malt
to
it
and
a
nice
hop
balance
for
american
bwine
poured
an
orange
with
a
nice
white
head
nose
super
malty
and
had
some
munich
malts
in
there
somewhere
some
citrus
to
it
as
well
this
was
almost
a
twisted
version
of
an
english
bwine
since
the
malt
profile
dominated
taste
was
oh
so
thick
and
malty
off
balanced
a
little
some
citrus
on
the
nose
followed
into
the
taste
tasted
perhaps
some
pineappleapricot
it
had
a
big
tropicalcitrus
bouquet
like
the
maharaja
iipa
just
maltier
and
less
hopped
good
brew
but
not
sure
if
call
this
a
bwine
maybe
a
unique
strong
ale
medium
body
ample
co2
quite
drinkable
pours
a
rich
cloudy
orange
amber
color
with
an
orange
rind
and
caramel
smell
and
taste
citrusy
and
a
touch
warming
from
the
alcohol
sharp
citrusy
alcohol
and
hops
with
a
medium
body
not
bad
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
nice
barleywine
not
in
my
list
of
favs
i
would
definitely
pick
up
again
if
i
had
the
chance
soft
and
maybe
slightly
watery
feeling
but
still
pretty
drinkable
for
a
bw
a
honey
amber
body
has
murky
wheat
tones
on
the
edges
where
light
comes
through
head
is
a
rocky
medium
tan
that
jumps
to
three
fingers
and
has
decent
retention
considerable
scattered
lace
is
left
behind
nose
is
shockingly
hoppy
for
the
style
with
fresh
cut
grassy
notes
and
hints
of
vanilla
oak
with
a
bit
of
spice
wow
for
a
barley
wine
this
sure
is
hoppy
matter
of
fact
if
i
didnt
know
better
id
say
i
was
drinking
a
double
ipa
hops
are
creamy
and
piney
with
soughy
spicey
malt
notes
tagging
along
a
raw
peppery
bitterness
coats
the
mouth
and
leaves
fresh
hoppy
feel
on
the
taste
buds
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
for
the
style
it
misses
the
mark
a
bit
the
drinkability
is
hurt
by
this
thanks
beertruth
what
would
i
drink
without
you
a
wonderful
tasting
barleywine
that
is
very
drinkable
i
really
like
it
if
it
was
a
local
brew
for
me
many
bombers
would
be
enjoyed
during
those
cool
fall
and
winter
months
overall
a
very
good
barleywine
good
drinkability
despite
the
robust
abv
for
the
abv
this
is
a
very
drinkable
barley
wine
more
toward
the
english
style
in
my
opinion
looking
forward
to
tapping
into
this
in
cask
update
on
cask
this
beer
is
simply
dumb
i
had
it
next
to
old
guardian
on
tap
and
the
old
guardian
looked
like
a
rookie
definitely
wellmade
but
a
middleoftheroad
barleywine
final
note
i
highly
recommended
this
brew
to
anyone
who
likes
barleywines
great
after
dinner
sipper
to
help
a
meal
go
down
but
now
now
its
time
to
justify
the
average
taste
and
drinkability
scores
i
just
gave
this
ah
shucks
you
know
its
like
a
barleywine
kind
of
i
was
comparing
it
to
smutty
and
well
for
my
tastes
the
hop
profile
was
just
all
wrong
weird
and
homebrewerish
ah
but
then
i
was
reminded
with
a
bigfoot
that
there
are
other
fish
in
the
sea
i
really
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
be
able
to
see
such
a
wide
range
of
beers
even
when
the
style
is
similar
i
still
think
that
the
hop
profile
seems
a
bit
on
the
amateur
side
here
im
not
trying
to
be
harsh
im
trying
to
say
that
work
could
be
done
on
giving
this
a
more
even
feel
and
taste
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
hops
aside
and
mouthfeel
are
spot
on
just
need
to
work
on
the
hops
ah
yes
then
there
are
different
batches
from
different
years
varying
according
to
the
mysteries
of
hop
differences
well
id
like
to
give
a
few
other
years
of
this
one
a
go
this
year
isnt
quite
what
im
looking
for
tastes
like
a
barley
wine
should
imo
a
good
balance
between
hops
malts
fruits
and
alcohol
notes
of
caramel
fruits
plums
and
other
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
overall
very
drinkable
very
tasty
but
kind
of
peculiar
an
interesting
mix
between
american
and
english
styles
but
overall
i
guess
id
think
of
it
more
as
an
american
strong
ale
in
style
im
not
sure
this
was
what
i
expected
the
flavor
turned
out
to
be
decent
after
i
was
a
bit
scared
due
to
the
appearance
i
would
have
liked
some
more
hop
balance
and
bitterness
not
sure
if
i
would
recommend
it
at
this
point
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
and
creamy
two
inch
tan
head
this
fluffy
head
dies
down
to
leave
some
sticky
lacing
all
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
hoppy
with
citrus
and
pine
notes
coming
through
as
well
as
figs
and
raisins
after
several
sniffs
the
taste
is
quite
bitter
with
some
wine
taste
as
well
as
raisins
and
pine
a
very
sticky
mouth
feeling
with
this
beer
and
some
warming
presence
from
the
high
abv
a
good
barleywine
indeed
d
ill
definitely
buy
more
but
this
is
too
high
octane
to
have
often
this
may
be
one
of
my
favorite
barley
wines
but
that
might
be
because
i
enjoy
the
subtlety
of
the
flavors
whereas
i
find
most
bws
to
be
onetrick
ponies
of
sweet
malt
this
isnt
the
brandylike
experience
that
one
often
gets
from
a
true
bw
but
still
i
found
this
to
be
delicious
i
had
high
expectations
with
this
beer
but
it
sorda
fell
flat
i
shared
this
beer
with
my
buddy
john
i
drank
this
from
a
brandy
shifter
burnt
orangejust
like
fall
colors
nice
off
white
head
that
fell
to
a
ring
pretty
fast
the
smell
was
boozyhops
and
some
spices
the
taste
was
the
same
as
the
smell
but
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
the
mouthful
is
smooth
and
sorda
on
the
thick
side
nice
carbonation
i
liked
this
more
as
it
warmed
up
but
this
is
nothing
i
would
seek
out
to
find
again
pours
a
somewhat
murky
coppery
orange
with
an
okay
initial
head
that
settles
pretty
quickly
to
a
cap
some
spotty
lacing
the
smell
is
fullof
alcohol
dry
malt
and
heavy
wood
taste
is
somewhat
similar
tastes
more
like
a
dry
mead
with
a
relatively
bitter
hop
presence
on
the
finish
and
then
aged
in
oak
with
some
cedar
chips
tossed
in
honey
on
the
finish
as
well
unusual
and
quite
tannic
mouthfeel
is
puckery
from
the
wood
tannins
dry
and
not
all
that
heavy
highly
oaked
beers
like
this
have
their
place
but
for
me
the
amount
of
wood
flavor
hampers
the
drinkability
on
the
plus
side
it
is
not
sweet
at
all
i
love
middle
ages
and
this
is
another
top
notch
brew
hop
bitterness
is
very
subdued
for
an
american
barleywine
pick
it
up
if
you
can
this
is
a
solid
american
barleywine
really
good
stuff
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
its
quite
filling
on
the
stomach
although
i
did
have
a
sizable
dinner
not
too
long
ago
had
only
tried
this
at
the
extreme
beer
fest
in
2006
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
orange
to
ruddy
brown
color
decent
enough
head
malty
and
hoppy
smelling
but
has
a
very
pronounced
earthy
aroma
slightly
musty
smelling
big
malt
flavor
but
again
with
the
earthiness
detracts
from
the
overall
flavor
for
me
big
hop
flavor
as
well
decent
bodynot
too
syrupy
but
has
a
nice
slickness
to
it
rather
drab
for
me
overall
the
earthy
and
musty
flavors
are
not
for
me
the
finish
is
pretty
crazy
very
puckery
delicious
if
youre
a
hop
enthusiast
but
maybe
a
bit
too
intense
if
you
lean
toward
the
english
barleywines
but
for
me
it
hits
all
the
right
buttons
id
bet
it
ages
well
too
d
once
you
get
used
to
the
hop
character
it
drinks
quite
nice
i
can
see
some
being
big
fans
of
this
just
for
the
hop
treatment
a
bit
different
than
i
would
want
for
stocking
up
the
cellar
but
in
the
style
of
american
barleywines
i
would
say
you
need
to
try
this
one
poured
into
a
chalice
a
nice
cleanclear
golden
amber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
small
creamy
tannish
head
which
lasted
forever
then
some
really
nice
islands
and
sticky
lacing
followed
the
nose
is
sweet
malty
and
lots
of
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
slightly
bitter
with
a
nice
touch
of
caramel
medium
body
abv
hidden
very
well
very
drinkable
a
different
barleywine
in
my
book
but
very
very
tasty
this
is
a
good
barleywine
and
those
who
like
the
style
will
probably
enjoy
this
version
drinkability
pretty
easy
going
mouthfeel
is
real
smooth
as
youd
expect
a
9
5
barleywine
to
be
almost
no
carbonation
and
leans
a
little
towards
the
slick
side
but
thats
expected
never
gets
too
heavy
hops
round
this
one
out
nicely
id
like
to
try
this
one
out
after
some
laying
down
cheers
a
fine
brew
sent
by
dmeadows
for
the
super
bowl
o
beer
bet
its
pretty
thick
especially
with
that
bite
as
one
of
the
accomplices
its
much
heavier
than
a
normal
ale
gotta
really
slug
it
down
due
to
it
being
so
dry
its
a
sipper
big
time
drinkable
but
only
for
a
while
really
hard
stuff
this
is
not
for
anyone
who
does
not
like
a
hoppy
beer
please
if
you
want
to
experience
a
great
example
of
an
american
barley
wine
please
try
this
one
as
i
am
indulging
in
my
second
pint
while
writing
this
i
must
conclude
my
review
so
i
can
further
enjoy
this
marvelous
brew
pours
a
beautiful
amber
red
with
a
hint
of
purple
or
maybe
im
just
dreaming
that
because
of
the
label
thick
frothy
head
with
a
nice
khaki
color
lace
remains
constant
throughout
the
brew
which
makes
the
druid
fluid
very
attractive
smell
is
dominate
with
fruity
hops
which
is
pleasing
to
me
has
a
hint
of
pine
with
a
minor
maltychoclatey
undertone
taste
is
quite
fruity
with
a
pleasant
smoothness
there
seems
to
be
some
grainy
texture
but
that
doesnt
take
away
from
the
drinkability
carbonation
remains
consistant
throughout
definitely
pick
up
this
brew
i
love
what
middle
ages
has
done
with
this
barleywine
definitely
pick
this
one
up
if
you
get
the
chance
especially
if
you
like
your
barleywines
fruity
got
this
freshly
tapped
cask
ale
on
its
first
day
out
at
mahars
came
with
a
big
fluffy
domed
head
that
lasted
for
quite
a
while
light
copperey
orange
color
and
hazy
aroma
had
big
notes
of
floral
and
citrusy
hops
along
with
some
sweet
malt
in
the
background
and
a
boozy
presence
this
beers
strength
is
really
detectable
in
the
nose
and
it
is
a
great
complex
aroma
taste
is
very
powerful
dont
plan
on
being
able
to
taste
any
additional
beers
after
youve
had
this
one
there
is
a
substantial
cirtus
hop
bang
to
start
off
followed
by
an
interestingly
unique
toffeylike
malt
flavor
that
i
havent
ever
experienced
before
the
finish
has
a
nice
bitterness
but
i
think
this
is
somewhat
toned
down
by
the
alcoholic
strength
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
on
this
ale
was
great
and
i
think
the
mouthfeel
of
just
about
any
beer
is
enhanced
by
cask
conditioning
it
was
served
at
an
appropriate
temperature
for
cask
and
had
a
nice
subtle
carbonation
that
did
not
steal
any
attention
away
from
the
great
flavors
of
this
beer
it
had
a
nice
thick
feel
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
not
a
shining
characteristic
of
this
beer
this
is
definately
not
meant
for
consumption
in
high
volumes
unless
you
want
to
inflict
some
pain
on
yourself
this
would
make
a
good
after
diner
drink
or
night
cap
wouldnt
do
more
than
one
although
as
with
many
other
beers
from
this
brewery
one
is
a
pleasure
and
very
satisfying
d
a
huge
beer
that
is
well
done
hoppy
but
also
malty
i
would
drink
it
again
2006
bottle
bought
at
capones
in
norristown
pa
in
late
december
wow
you
know
i
bought
a
lot
of
stuff
there
more
than
i
thought
pours
orange
brown
and
clear
with
a
tannish
head
smells
sweet
a
little
buttery
smooth
milky
bitter
malt
flavor
not
overly
bitter
though
doesnt
taste
like
its
a
super
young
beer
the
buttery
odor
thing
is
represented
in
the
flavor
too
which
is
also
something
i
picked
up
when
i
tried
wailing
wench
from
the
same
brewery
maybe
thats
just
a
characteristic
of
their
beers
but
its
not
something
im
a
huge
fan
of
eh
its
ok
overall
drinks
ok
and
isnt
at
all
harsh
d
it
is
good
but
i
wouldnt
go
crazy
over
it
funny
to
drink
really
oddly
drying
and
reminiscent
of
ginger
ale
not
particularly
meaty
but
still
overall
a
good
brew
now
to
find
some
fresh
to
go
with
my
remaining
aged
bottle
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
there
was
a
fairly
good
sized
offwhite
head
on
it
but
it
dropped
off
rather
quickly
an
interesting
aroma
something
different
almost
every
time
i
take
a
whiff
some
citrus
as
well
as
other
fruits
also
some
caramel
and
butterscotch
maybe
a
hint
of
floral
also
the
taste
is
a
touch
harsh
i
would
expect
more
smoothness
definitely
a
full
body
and
some
of
the
carmal
sweetness
is
coming
through
a
somewhat
dryslightly
bittermetallic
aftertaste
not
enough
to
make
it
bad
just
different
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
bad
bottle
just
not
the
best
flavor
i
could
not
resist
reviewing
this
beer
on
the
winter
solstice
pours
a
good
head
the
nose
is
all
ringwood
since
it
is
a
middle
ages
brew
malty
with
a
bit
of
hops
to
it
it
has
a
good
mouthfeel
and
is
easy
to
drink
for
a
barleywine
a
solid
brew
cheers
truly
enjoyed
this
druid
fluid
the
hopmalt
balance
tips
slightly
to
the
hop
side
and
fits
my
tastes
just
fine
nicely
done
gotta
love
the
name
of
this
beer
and
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
very
nice
american
barleywinestrong
and
hoppy
amber
colored
beer
with
copper
highlights
hazy
strong
hop
character
in
the
nose
clear
even
over
the
turkey
in
the
oven
in
the
background
big
malty
base
comes
through
in
the
nose
as
well
but
really
stands
out
when
taking
a
sip
hop
continues
strong
on
the
web
it
says
the
hop
dominates
when
young
and
thats
exactly
what
im
drinking
strong
somewhat
complex
barleywine
with
an
assertive
hop
i
think
this
one
would
aged
very
well
mellow
the
hop
and
add
to
the
complexity
of
the
six
malt
base
worth
the
trip
a
nice
ballsy
barleywine
drinks
a
little
hot
and
alcohol
presence
is
undeniable
but
its
still
damn
tasty
an
average
barleywine
a
shame
because
the
name
is
quite
memorable
even
if
the
beer
isnt
this
one
doesnt
try
to
be
hugely
anything
so
dont
expect
to
be
hugely
over
impressed
the
only
thing
id
say
this
hugely
is
is
something
id
recommended
for
true
barleywine
fans
and
oh
how
they
danced
the
little
children
of
stonehenge
a
very
solid
barely
wine
this
exampled
was
cellared
for
a
while
id
like
to
see
have
this
on
tap
get
one
of
these
from
the
brewery
if
you
can
great
beer
and
great
people
not
sure
the
age
of
this
one
but
it
looked
good
and
smelled
good
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
sweet
hoppiness
on
the
nose
the
taste
was
pleasantly
balanced
but
with
a
great
hop
profile
edging
out
the
malt
the
aftertaste
was
long
and
pleasant
which
bw
lovers
love
great
silky
package
as
well
this
is
going
back
on
the
want
list
i
had
this
beer
at
sunset
bar
grill
back
in
the
winter
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
on
tap
its
just
as
good
out
of
the
bottle
this
is
another
above
average
beer
from
middle
ages
in
syracuse
ny
pours
a
dark
chestnut
brown
with
a
pretty
dew
body
that
leaves
a
spotchy
tan
head
that
disappears
the
nose
is
sour
funky
with
a
cooked
sugar
sweetness
floural
hops
with
a
strong
malty
background
the
taste
starts
bitter
upfront
strong
hop
and
alcohal
backdrop
but
balanced
with
a
slight
caramel
sweetness
nice
barleywine
good
interpretation
one
that
i
will
def
go
back
to
overall
a
solid
american
barley
wine
d
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
sort
of
perfumy
tastes
as
if
made
with
sweet
and
low
while
the
looks
bordered
on
a
dipa
the
smell
was
nothing
of
the
kind
the
herbal
hops
were
still
amazingly
evident
but
the
primary
aroma
was
that
of
sweet
malts
reminding
me
of
a
fruit
cocktail
from
a
can
the
taste
was
also
sweet
but
not
at
all
cloying
the
individual
fruit
flavors
were
hard
to
pick
out
now
and
the
hops
added
a
spicy
edge
alcohol
was
more
evident
than
beers
of
this
age
but
not
in
a
hot
flashy
way
this
was
quite
a
bit
easier
to
drink
than
i
remember
from
couple
of
years
ago
i
would
not
consider
this
a
stunning
barleywine
but
it
did
taste
quite
good
with
some
creamy
danish
blue
cheese
d
high
other
than
the
highish
abv
this
is
an
easy
drinkin
bw
the
purple
wizardish
label
kicks
ass
plus
it
is
gold
foiled
on
top
this
poured
a
very
orangey
amber
with
a
great
foamy
off
white
head
didnt
last
too
long
though
wow
the
aroma
is
amazing
yeasty
fruity
and
strong
kinda
smells
like
a
fruit
elixer
like
cough
syrup
this
smells
o
so
sweet
and
hoppy
pine
and
citrus
scents
were
noticed
the
taste
rocks
as
well
the
caramel
and
fruit
flavors
rock
the
alcohol
isnt
quite
as
attacking
as
i
would
have
expected
you
can
feel
it
but
not
taste
it
nice
warmth
though
many
barley
wines
are
just
bumped
up
ipas
but
even
though
this
one
kinda
tastes
like
an
ipa
it
is
certainly
a
barleywine
pours
medium
caramel
with
decent
carbonation
not
much
head
some
lacing
smells
are
light
with
floral
hops
a
little
dried
fruitiness
taste
is
rather
balanced
hops
alcohol
and
sweetness
almost
caramel
in
nature
very
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
a
little
lighter
than
others
but
you
can
down
more
than
one
and
be
happy
tasty
barleywine
interested
to
see
how
it
will
age
a
tad
dissapointing
i
may
have
had
too
warm
a
bottle
but
still
i
was
expecting
more
it
pours
a
nice
amber
with
a
thick
creamu
head
and
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
very
nice
strong
sweet
maltiness
fruity
elements
light
yeastiness
and
alcohols
note
however
very
surprisingly
the
tatse
was
very
tart
pungent
with
an
overwhelming
hop
presence
not
what
i
expected
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
is
this
9
5abv
and
dry
the
finish
was
too
bitter
which
affects
drinkability
2004
vintage
pours
dark
copper
to
muddy
brown
in
color
and
quite
cloudy
sweet
malt
aromas
of
caramel
white
grapes
prunes
and
over
ripe
berries
tastes
of
sweet
maltiness
with
a
warm
alcohol
kick
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
i
expected
and
i
cannot
discern
any
hop
flavors
both
probably
due
to
age
a
nicely
aged
barley
wine
that
i
would
definitely
hope
to
try
fresh
as
well
kind
of
reminds
me
of
their
wailing
wench
double
ipa
with
maybe
a
touch
more
sweetness
i
like
that
beer
a
lot
so
thats
great
i
dont
know
why
i
was
sitting
on
this
for
so
long
draught
redbones
dark
orange
color
sweet
fruits
strawberries
and
raspberries
as
well
as
some
medicinal
herbaceous
aroma
hops
in
the
nose
hops
are
piney
and
medicinal
while
the
malt
backing
is
strange
and
unfitting
very
sweet
and
just
not
all
that
exciting
at
all
medium
bodied
warming
brew
light
herballywoodsy
hops
on
the
finish
that
left
a
very
tiny
bit
of
dryness
high
alcohol
was
hidden
very
well
not
the
greatest
barleywine
ive
ever
had
certainly
worth
a
shot
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
dangerous
there
is
some
flavor
here
that
is
really
nice
i
never
tasted
it
in
a
barleywine
before
alcohol
very
well
hidden
highly
recommended
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
a
slickness
to
it
goes
down
fairly
easily
while
still
having
a
good
chewy
barleywine
body
at
this
point
im
not
left
wanting
to
reach
for
another
however
this
has
been
in
my
cellar
for
a
bit
so
ill
look
out
for
a
fresh
bottle
to
try
at
other
time
thanks
to
dmeadows
for
throwing
this
my
way
overall
very
impressive
another
winner
from
middle
ages
amber
with
a
tan
head
that
lasts
quite
a
long
time
nice
lacing
smell
is
of
spice
and
pine
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbionated
taste
is
hoppedbut
not
overly
so
refreshing
with
a
nice
bite
the
finish
was
spicywith
a
hint
of
pine
nice
christmas
ale
not
to
bad
for
an
american
barleywine
but
i
was
a
little
disappointed
the
metallic
bitterness
and
odd
sort
of
taste
left
me
with
an
odd
feeling
beer
poured
into
a
standard
logoed
pint
glass
no
head
nice
color
a
pale
golden
bronze
nice
haze
and
opacity
very
little
nose
on
the
brew
a
slight
lemoncitrus
tone
was
apparent
neither
malt
nor
hops
domminate
in
this
one
almost
a
strong
pale
ale
flavor
and
note
would
best
describe
this
brew
good
mouthfeel
and
it
is
easy
though
not
entirely
rewarding
to
drink
a
good
unoffensive
redition
of
the
barley
wine
style
smells
almost
like
candy
fruity
like
overly
fruitysweetchewysticky
kids
candy
floral
hop
aroma
hops
are
very
up
front
for
a
barley
wine
in
my
view
and
while
they
rest
on
a
malt
body
little
sweetness
light
viscosity
more
of
that
fruit
and
a
creamy
butter
that
starts
to
be
a
little
unpleasant
just
as
the
hops
kick
it
out
and
leave
a
pretty
dry
finish
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
does
away
with
the
butter
just
before
it
becomes
obtrusive
mouthfeel
is
creamy
from
the
butter
prickly
from
the
hops
and
full
from
the
malt
this
is
a
one
a
night
at
most
kinda
beer
for
me
an
interesting
and
unique
barley
wine
not
the
nightcap
style
thicker
sweeter
deeper
im
most
partial
to
but
interesting
for
sure
smells
of
berries
other
fruits
and
alcohol
subtle
taste
of
malt
not
much
head
to
speak
of
but
a
little
white
lace
stays
throughout
this
beers
consumption
there
is
a
hint
of
caramel
in
the
smell
and
taste
as
well
this
beer
is
actually
quite
smooth
for
its
high
alcohol
content
which
is
most
prevalent
at
the
end
of
a
sip
a
decent
sipper
here
the
warmth
is
good
and
the
flavors
develope
nicely
not
the
beastly
barleywine
it
could
be
but
cleanly
smooth
soothingly
warm
and
tender
to
the
buds
gives
more
of
an
impression
of
an
english
style
then
the
bigger
hoppier
american
brutes
that
i
tend
to
favor
not
bad
though
walnut
brown
in
color
with
some
tinged
of
red
a
small
amount
of
offwhite
head
most
noticeable
in
the
aroma
is
the
caramel
and
toffee
but
also
some
citrus
notes
sweet
malty
flavor
with
toffee
and
brown
sugar
a
little
citrus
in
the
finish
this
was
a
little
thinner
than
most
barleywines
ive
had
but
pretty
good
overall
it
really
hides
the
alcohol
well
looks
like
murky
iced
tea
in
my
glass
with
a
fluffy
head
the
head
fell
to
a
film
of
bubbles
that
stuck
around
for
the
duration
smells
deliciously
hoppy
much
like
victorys
stormking
now
that
has
my
attention
the
malt
smells
very
sweet
and
with
the
hops
it
smells
like
caramel
with
a
bit
of
coffee
the
flavor
is
very
tangy
almost
like
grapefruit
with
a
little
malt
behind
it
the
hops
dont
do
much
to
the
flavor
and
stand
out
a
bit
awkwardly
its
a
bit
different
but
not
entirely
unenjoyable
the
mouth
feel
is
thick
with
very
light
carbonation
over
all
id
say
this
beer
is
a
tasty
sipper
that
goes
down
smooth
but
its
a
barley
wine
so
by
style
its
a
bit
of
an
odd
one
okay
by
the
end
of
the
glass
the
hops
were
wearing
on
me
a
nice
dry
woody
finish
with
a
gentle
alcohol
sting
but
also
a
bileflavor
like
when
cacking
up
dryheaves
salty
and
acidic
i
cant
finish
this
one
drinkability
is
good
surprised
the
alcohol
isnt
as
prevalent
as
i
would
expect
it
to
be
all
in
all
this
was
a
nice
change
up
from
my
usual
porters
thanks
to

bbbif
great
amber
colornot
as
dark
as
other
barley
wines
no
head
nose
was
very
mild
some
fruits
and
sugary
malts
flavor
was
too
good
to
put
down
berries
come
out
at
first
quickly
followed
by
all
sorts
of
sugars
floral
bouquet
then
quickly
rises
but
not
too
loudly
so
as
to
be
a
kick
in
the
teeth
but
more
of
a
complement
nice
balance
in
this
beer
little
bit
of
bread
and
wet
flower
as
well
mouthfeel
is
slightly
cloying
and
stretched
the
cheeks
out
a
bit
but
not
so
much
as
to
leave
my
taste
buds
in
shock
beer
is
good
happy
beering
appearance
is
a
clear
orange
brown
color
with
a
small
but
persistent
head
smell
is
mixed
berries
with
a
dry
champagnelike
quality
very
interesting
there
is
also
some
bready
malt
there
in
the
taste
the
berries
really
come
out
this
is
the
first
nonfruit
beer
ive
ever
had
that
had
such
a
pronounced
berry
taste
the
sweetness
of
the
berries
and
malt
is
balanced
out
by
an
extreme
prickly
dryness
which
dominates
the
finish
alcohol
is
also
slightly
noticeable
but
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
as
well
but
it
could
maybe
use
a
bit
more
body
this
sample
is
much
better
than
the
one
i
had
a
few
months
ago
so
it
appears
that
age
has
done
it
well
a
very
bold
offering
and
definitely
of
the
most
interesting
beers
which
i
mean
in
a
really
really
good
way
i
have
had
in
awhile
drinkability
was
good
i
liked
it
and
would
have
it
again
pours
a
golden
brown
clear
tight
white
head
copious
lacing
smell
was
alcohol
fruity
and
malty
sweet

small
amount
of
hops
in
the
nose
taste
is
some
alcohol
up
front
dark
fruits
floral
hoppy
bitterness
pretty
smooth
carbonation
was
nice
and
low
definately
more
of
an
english
style
barleywine
and
the
hops
were
very
subdued
however
a
tasty
beer
thanks
drjay
deep
reddish
amber
colour
very
clear
with
a
cream
coloured
head
the
aroma
is
rich
in
malt
with
lower
degrees
of
hops
ripe
fruit
sugary
sweetness
and
alcohol
the
flavour
is
dominated
by
a
combination
of
caramel
maltiness
alcohol
and
bitterness
with
lower
levels
of
fruit
and
hop
character
the
alcohol
was
a
little
on
the
coarse
side
especially
towards
the
finish
however
this
mellowed
somewhat
as
it
warmed
up
and
the
fruit
flavour
became
more
pronounced
resulting
in
a
better
balance
slightly
grainy
and
viscous
texture
decent
body
with
lower
carbonation
i
found
this
one
to
be
more
englishlike
in
character
with
hops
taking
more
of
a
backseat
to
malt
not
super
complex
but
it
doesnt
need
to
be
id
definitely
have
this
one
again
druid
fluid
is
a
friendly
sort
of
barleywine
and
would
be
a
great
beer
to
introduce
the
uninitiated
to
the
style
im
enjoying
the
fruitiness
and
the
easy
drinkability
but
there
are
a
whole
host
of
other
versions
that
id
reach
for
first
thanks
to
happyhourhero
for
the
bottle
just
average
imo
for
me
so
many
better
options
out
there
bottle
poured
a
copperbrown
color
ale
with
a
medium
dark
head
with
excellent
retention
aroma
of
strong
malty
sweetness
with
subtle
alcohol
notes
is
clearly
evident
taste
has
a
real
creamy
feel
to
it
with
some
malt
but
everything
seems
to
be
covered
by
strong
bitter
hops
body
is
full
and
even
though
taste
has
a
warming
feel
to
it
you
cannot
detect
the
alcohol
good
barleywine
overall
but
i
guess
i
prefer
them
without
too
many
hops
and
more
malt
presence
or
again
maybe
i
should
have
aged
the
bottle
a
bit
more
thanks
to
ericaweizen
for
the
chance
to
try
my
second
middle
ages
brew
thx
to
happyhourhero
for
the
bottles
just
some
curling
and
twisting
of
covering
bubbles
that
sticks
somewhat
dark
orange
hue
with
a
bit
of
haze
but
also
some
nice
action
heading
up
oaky
malt
rhubarb
and
some
salty
pine
essence
on
nose
with
a
sherwin
williams
paint
fining
kind
of
an
airy
flavor
not
syrupy
like
many
barleywines
and
there
is
some
kind
of
berry
in
there
that
is
unusual
i
know
the
alcohol
is
in
there
but
the
malt
is
so
understated
again
for
the
style
that
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
a
little
unusual
but
topnotch
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
chestnut
color
with
some
ruby
highlights
i
get
a
small
fizzy
beige
head
on
an
agressive
pour
aroma
is
some
lemon
mixing
with
butterscotch
and
toffee
and
a
hit
of
ripe
plums
and
raisins
the
first
sip
reveals
a
smooth
textured
almost
creamy
body
with
very
very
fine
carbonation
that
tingles
across
my
palate
flavor
is
generally
sweet
with
toffee
and
brown
sugar
up
front
which
rolls
to
a
slightly
bitter
finish
that
i
attribute
to
alcohol
not
hops
other
than
the
bitey
finish
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
i
get
a
bit
of
belly
warming
afte
the
swallow
a
nice
brew
for
sure
pours
a
hazy
amberorange
with
12
inch
of
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
malty
there
are
hints
of
raisens
and
oranges
and
the
hops
come
through
just
enough
to
balance
the
aroma
nicely
though
i
wouldnt
mind
some
more
hop
aroma
feels
like
a
lot
going
on
in
the
mouth
its
sweet
up
front
the
malt
really
doing
its
job
theres
a
taste
of
alcohol
that
kicks
in
next
but
its
smooth
and
warm
theres
a
smokey
finish
that
is
interesting
i
really
like
it
not
too
hoppy
but
the
hops
are
present
and
balance
the
malt
nicely
with
a
slightly
bitter
bite
at
the
end
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
without
being
sticky
im
not
really
sure
what
to
think
about
this
one
looked
decent
poured
an
orange
amber
colour
with
really
sticky
nice
looking
lacing
smell
was
fruity
with
a
bit
of
hops
everything
was
nice
up
until
the
tasting
came
i
thought
it
was
quite
bitter
and
had
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
bite
i
didnt
care
for
it
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
it
seemed
far
too
heavy
to
get
a
good
drinkability
rating
perhaps
the
beer
itself
is
bad
and
i
should
try
it
again
for
now
however
this
rating
stands
its
not
for
me
on
a
side
note
i
will
say
that
the
caskconditioned
is
better
than
the
bottled
version
but
still
a
very
good
beer
i
never
had
any
problems
with
my
caps
but
that
is
probably
because
i
transported
the
beer
myself
and
treated
it
like
it
was
fragile
glassware
if
you
every
find
yourself
near
syracuse
do
yourself
a
favor
and
visit
the
brewery
it
will
be
well
worth
the
trip
additionally
if
you
find
yourself
within
a
couple
hundred
miles
of
caskconditioned
druid
fluid
go
and
drink
some
gold
foil
removed
cap
blasted
off
the
bottle
with
much
force
have
no
idea
how
old
this
is
which
would
be
nice
to
know
really
nice
shade
of
ambergarnet
smells
slightly
estery
and
floral
classic
underbelly
of
malt
in
the
vapors
highly
hoppy
i
assume
this
is
the
intention
very
ipa
like
with
a
nicely
sweet
undercurrent
of
fruity
malt
raisin
clove
pepper
and
sugar
dance
behind
the
hop
veil
its
pretty
well
balanced
but
the
overhopped
barleywines
just
arent
my
thing
still
a
great
beer
i
see
its
charm
and
ill
bang
it
but
i
will
not
propose
for
me
this
is
a
near
perfect
barleywine
its
an
allinclusive
brew
combining
aspects
of
particular
variations
of
ipa
with
their
citrusygoodness
and
a
much
more
malt
based
old
ale
not
only
can
this
be
consumed
very
easily
it
can
also
be
stored
for
ages
let
those
hops
mellow
out
and
youve
got
a
nicely
balanced
barleywine
this
particular
bottle
has
been
around
in
my
possesion
for
about
seven
months
and
is
very
wellbalanced
but
still
shows
many
signs
of
rich
citrus
hops
i
need
a
new
bottle
a
very
good
barleywine
one
that
could
definitely
be
laid
down
for
with
very
positive
mellowing
efects
thanks
again
to
southernbrew
for
my
first
beer
from
middle
ages
which
turned
out
to
be
a
fine
barleywine
thanks
to
shippos
for
this
one
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
good
caramel
character
with
some
citrus
hops
the
flavor
is
incredibly
smooth
for
the
level
of
alcohol
the
caramel
malts
and
the
hops
blend
very
well
and
make
for
a
really
enjoyable
brew
drinkability
is
really
good
especially
for
the
level
of
alcohol
this
one
pours
a
slightly
pale
copper
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
a
healthy
coating
over
the
beer
the
nose
is
really
nice
with
a
nice
blast
of
citrusy
hops
over
tope
of
a
really
nice
thick
caramel
malt
it
smells
really
damn
good
the
flavor
is
nice
very
balanced
between
super
fantastic
grapefruity
sweet
hops
and
very
mellow
but
pronounced
caramel
malt
the
hop
also
rides
on
as
a
residual
bitter
but
in
the
best
wey
no
offensiveness
no
harshness
all
sweet
hop
the
feel
is
nice
and
thick
bordering
on
slightly
syrupy
very
coating
over
the
tongue
shit
i
just
checked
the
abv
and
it
says
9
5
i
would
have
guessed
7
just
because
i
know
its
a
barleywine
wow
not
even
a
hint
of
that
alcohol
anywhere
this
beer
is
dangerous
in
a
good
way
i
will
need
t
find
a
way
to
get
this
beer
in
kentucky
again
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
blue
tusk
during
a
recent
visit
to
syracuse
it
came
as
a
cloudy
amber
beer
with
only
a
thin
head
it
has
a
great
malty
nose
heightening
my
anticipation
level
all
the
more
my
first
reaction
to
it
was
that
it
is
very
sweet
then
that
it
is
very
potent
hence
the
small
serving
size
it
tastes
of
cherries
and
plums
but
with
a
warmness
brought
on
by
the
alcohol
content
the
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
and
the
finish
is
pleasant
with
a
good
slightly
hot
afterburn
yum
yum
ontap
at
the
brewery
tap
dark
ruddy
amberbrown
with
a
nice
collar
of
khaki
foam
the
aroma
is
complex
and
it
consists
of
dark
fruits
caramel
roasted
malts
alcohol
toffee
fresh
somewhat
raw
herbal
hops
and
more
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
the
taste
is
also
very
very
complex
i
taste
a
sweet
juicy
blast
of
fruit
flavors
up
front
with
a
deep
caramel
malt
backbone
that
also
shows
hints
of
toffee
the
finish
is
juicy
with
fresh
green
hops
stealing
the
show
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
coating
and
perfect
and
the
finish
is
very
warming
and
decadent
the
drinkability
is
also
awesome
for
a
barleywine
in
fact
this
is
almost
a
session
barleywine
awesome
stuff
truly
maybe
their
best
brew
barleywine
it
is
also
major
hoppy
and
ringwood
yeast
and
candylike
malting
very
drinkable
and
satisfying
was
fresh
off
the
line
served
up
by
old
marcus
and
cheers
to
him
for
this
must
get
more
even
a
tad
of
bitterness
in
aftertaste
as
opposed
to
too
much
sweetness
could
be
interesting
iff
ageable
unique
and
to
be
enjoyed
by
all
but
the
harshest
palate
this
poured
out
a
deep
cloudy
copper
color
with
a
goodsized
off
white
head
good
lacing
and
retention
aroma
contained
cherries
caramel
and
a
bit
of
other
malty
goodness
i
really
had
to
get
this
one
swirling
around
to
get
much
from
the
nose
as
it
was
quite
weak
the
flavor
started
off
with
fruit
sweetness
before
a
bit
of
roastiness
came
on
the
backside
notes
of
alcohol
and
caramel
popped
up
throughout
mouthfeel
was
full
with
a
sticky
sweetness
pretty
good
overall
drinkability
a
very
solid
barley
wine
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
thanks
goes
to
ppoitras
for
this
fine
brew
pretty
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
lighter
in
terms
of
abv
than
most
of
the
style
as
well
a
bit
bland
re
flavor
but
a
pretty
pleasant
ale
imo
there
are
many
other
better
tasting
barleywines
out
there
but
this
one
is
worth
a
try
dark
peach
color
with
a
nice
frothy

on
the
pour
in
the

tropical
sweetish
pineapple
fragrance
in
the
nose
initial
stinging
bitter
grapefruit
taste
mellows
into
orange
rind
and
sweet
caramel
notes
on
the
tongue
the
feel
is
quite
rich
and
full
bodied
on
the
tongue
and
mouth
the
brew
then
dries
the
tongue
on
the
finish
with
slight
abv
warmth
in
the
chest
comforting
in
its
rich
bitterness
nice
bottle
of
at
least
6
months
of
age
clear

with
a
lasting
tan

malty

fresh

slight

definately
smells
bigger
than
it
tastes
rather
thin
feeling
for
a
bw
i
prefer
the
thick
coating
kind
i
would
call
this
an
english
style
bwless
assertive
than
our
american
bws
finishes
is
medium
w
some
hops
it
need
smore
hops
to
balance
the
predominant
malts
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
barely
warming
not
bad
but
not
too
exciting
or
memorable
either
the
beer
appears
a
brownishred
or
reddish
brown
poured
in
this
here
wine
glass
it
is
time
for
me
to
get
a
real
goblet
a
slightly
hazey
amber
ale
with
a
small
beige
head
at
first
the
aroma
is
full
of
a
fruity
sweetness
and
then
in
the
background
the
is
a
building
hop
presence
the
hops
make
their
presence
felt
in
the
flavor
right
away
there
is
some
sweetness
in
the
taste
and
some
of
it
comes
again
from
the
hops
in
the
form
of
a
grapefruit
finish
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
happens
to
these
characteristics
after
being
put
down
for
a
year
or
two
pours
with
a
onefinger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
some

aftertaste

for
a
12oz
bottle
from

beverage
cen
albany
ny
i
expected
this
to
be
more
british
in
style
with
a
malt
dominance
overall
however
this
has
some
kickass
hoppiness
that
prevails
nicely
complex
highly
drinkable
and
an
excellent
barleywine
wish
i
could
middle
ages
brews
in
my
area
very
enjoyable
definitely
a
hop
focus
but
not
as
much
as
others
ive
had
i
have
4
more
and
am
anxious
to
see
if
some
of
the
rough
edges
can
be
smoothed
out
good
nonetheless
great
big
hops
on

with
a
hint
of
alcohool
bite
lightly
nutty
full
bodied
and
chewy
with
a
pleasantly
bitter

aftertaste
a
pleasant
surprise
this
one
could
stand
to
be
aged
a
bit
for
sure
but
very
tasty
and
drinkable
now
a
fine
barleywine
pours
a
delicious
tawny
red
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
falls
to
a
thick
belgian
lace
the
aroma
is
alcohol
honey
caramel
grassy
hops
plums
and
apples
the
taste
leads
with
a
calm
before
the
storm
as
the
flavors
debate
who
should
go
first
before
they
all
bumrush
your
palate
its
an
onslaught
but
nothing
particularly
amazing
to
me
alcohol
is
over
the
top
malts
are
subdued
hops
are
walking
around
all
addlebrained
unbalanced
in
a
word
im
going
to
hang
on
to
the
rest
of
this
pack
for
a
couple
months
and
see
what
happens
mouthfeel
is
sharp
and
biting
due
to
carbonation
and
alcohol
with
a
very
dry
finish
decent
to
drink
and
better
than
others
ive
had
but
nothing
to
write
home
to
at
this
point
druid
fluid
just
love
the
name
it
was
the
reason
for
picking
this
brew
off
the
shelf
then
i
saw
it
was
a
barley
wine
and
had
to
have
it
amber
brew
with
nice
head

by
constant
stream

tatse

toffee
fruity
and
hoppy
more
mellow
then
other
barley
wines
nothing
really
comes
to
surface
as
dominating
just
a
fruity
malty
brew
with
hint
of
toffee
and
a
good
dose
of
the
old
hop
taste
is
good
but
not
extraordinary
mouthfeel
is
good
little
light
for
the
style
in
my
humble
opinion
drinkability
is
good
no
real
alcohol
taste
just
nice
warming
of
the
insides
overall
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
american
barleywines
ive
ever
had
simply
flawless
the
key
word
here
is
smooth
this
is
one
heavenly
brew
from
beginning
to
end
highly
recommended
very
smooth
and
mellow
with
a
sweet
citrus
pucker
emerging
mid
sip
the
substantial
alcohol
is
masked
quite
well
which
makes
this
some
dangerous
stuff
a
mild
bitterness
finishes
this
off
but
overall
quite
pleasant
drinkability
probably
wouldnt
have
grabbed
another
one
if
i
had
one
available
but
definitely
not
hard
to
finish
the
bottle
appearance
dark
brown
apricot
color
murky
with
a
little
bit
of
head
whihc
recedes
very
quickly

is
not
very
sticky

has
a
lot
of
toasted
rye
and
wheat
with
a
spicy
sweet
chocolate
smell
and
an
charred
earthy
ester
behind
malt
backbone
is
there
too
with
a
tiny
hint
of
hops
when
you
taste
this
beer
it
almost
takes
you
aback
the
taste
is
very
sharp
up
front
with
a
raw
unmellowed
hop
flavor
and
a
spiced
citrus
hint
with
the
butter
from
the
ringwood
yeast
definately
evident
i
wasnt
bothered
by
the
aftertaste
which
was
pleasantly
bitter
and
spicy
but
my
compatriots
mostly
noted
that
it
was
too
metalic
and
bitter
medium
body
and
a
blast
of
sharp
carbonation
give
this
a
great
mouthfeel
this
beer
definately
needs
to
be
aged
a
few
years
to
let
the
flavors
tune
down
and
mellow

like

too

interesting
bw
worth
checking
out
if
you
enjoy
this
style
alot
going
on
in
this
one
a
tasty
and
interesting
barleywine
very
english
in
nature
in
that
it
is
malty
but
well
balanced
but
throws
just
a
hint
of
americanization
in
the
fruitiness
and
sweetness
murky
tan
body
that
leaves
little

burnt
malts
start
and
end
this
brew
with
a
sticky
hop
flavor
and
a
lot
of
citrus
and
lemon
flavors
that
are
easily
detectable
in
the
aftertaste
too
nose
is
both
sweet
and
toasty
with
notes
of
lemon
juice
mouthfeel
is
more
creamy
than
smacking
with
hops
as
fits
with
the
more
english
style
a
great
drinker
the
higher
abv
barely
noticeable
one
i
wish
i
bought
many
more
of
both
to
drink
now
and
to
age
as
i
think
this
would
get
quite
interesting
with
time
seek
this
one
out
overall
this
was
a
solid
barleywine
style
ale
and
easily
my
favorite
middle
ages
brew
big
thanks
to
oldfrothingslosh
for
the
bottle
i
love
middle
ages
they
do
things
right
and
take
a
lot
of
pride
in
what
they
do
it
shows
in
a
big
way
here
thanks
to
mah
honey
for
schlepping
this
back
from
nyc
for
me
notes
i
like
nearly
everything
about
this
beer
other
than
the
dryness
which
only
affects
the
drinkability
for
me
to
me
a
barleywine
should
finish
slightly
sweet
still
very
solid
cheers
it
pours
an
almost
clear
copper
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
sticking
to
the
glass
aroma
of
rich
cream
dry
malt
caramel
and
maple
a
an
unappropriate
yeasty
character
that
shows
in
the
form
of
dust
taste
is
a
big
surprise
very
fruity
berries
grapes
very
alcoholic
with
a
dry
cobwebs
finish
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
this
is
no
jw
lees
a
big
thick
creamcolored
dense
head
collapses
to
a
bumpy
rocky
creamscape
thick
psycho
lacy
lacing
a
foggy
orangebrown
beer
tries
to
hide
some
pinkishness
the
nose
is
sweet
cream
fruity
caramel
there
is
alcohol
and
some
ink
a
sweet
caramel
front
shows
lots
of
hops
a
thick
syrupy
middle
full
of
fruit
but
its
not
too
sweet
nice
the
finish
dries
but
is
still
fruity
fresh
apples
and
its
quite
hoppy
bitter
some
ink
survives
what
a
nice
light
fruity
hoppy
barley
wine
its
fairly
sweet
but
thats
nicely
offset
by
big
tart
citrus
hoppiness
a
different
barlewine
to
be
sure
but
one
i
really
enjoyed
another
success
from
the
middle
ages
folks
strong
alcohol
aroma
aroma

head
after
pouring
in
a
rapscallion
snifter
smooth
buttery
flavor
up
front
but
the
alcohol
is
the
overpowering
taste
here
wish
additional
malt
or
something
would
temper
the
ethanol
a
bit
but
that
just
doesnt
seem
to
be
happening
today
still
for
a
barleywine
that
sort
of
trait
has
to
be
somewhat
expected
another
worthy
brew
from
middle
ages
just
wish
they
were
a
little
more
available
outside
of
the
region
appearance
semiclouded
copper

with
an
off
white
cream
colored

fine
specks
of
lacing

aroma
great
english
style
malts
here
blended
with
an
edge
of
pine
cone
and
orange
peel
thrown
in
for
good
measures
the
nose
is
very
peculiar
but
the
creamy
edge
and
citrus
profile
brings
it
together
taste
very
sweet
creaminess
in
the
flavor
some
candi
sugar
is
here
creating
alot
of
sweetness
but
at
the
same
time
theres
a
load
of
hopes
here
fighting
it
out
for
the
balance
of
sweet
and
bitterness
who
will
prevail
well
im
not
sorry
to
say
that
a
draw
was
found
due
to
the
pure
awesome
mix
that
each
caramel
sugary
malts
and
pine
cone
orange
citrus
hops
add
here
to
the
complexity
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
mild
carbonation
goes
down
without
any
cloying
edges
drinkability
beware
of
the
alcohol
goes
down
quite
smoothly
here
pours
a
burntcopper
color
with
a
fantastic
laceproducing
head
the
aroma
is
a
wildly
complex
mix
of
ripe
fruits
and
floral
hops
my
first
smell
made
me
think
of
a
well
hopped
americanstyle
barleywine
but
as
your
nose
settles
into
the
beer
sweet
malts
and
fruits
come
popping
out
id
like
to
have
one
after
its
aged
for
a
couple
of
years
apricot
cherry
plumsesters
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
less
complex
than
the
aroma
grainy
malty
softness
and
alcohol
a
little
butterscotch
but
nothing
too
serious
finish
is
a
slightly
bitter
this
is
a
solidly
good
barleywine
it
falls
short
of
the
best
beers
of
the
style
but
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
perfect
for
a
cold
january
night
decent
drinkability
but
not
as
subtle
and
complex
has
i
would
have
liked
this
is
a
deep
amber
with
a
good
head
it
is
a
little
bit
thin
on
the
flavor
but
it
has
a
fruity
finish
its
far
from
bad
but
theres
nothing
here
that
makes
me
willing
to
go
out
searching
for
it
in
the
future
to
be
truly
great
it
would
need
to
have
the
malt
bumped
up
a
good
bit
thanks
to
todd
translucent
deep
orange
color
with
a
big
beige
heads
that
lasts
for
a
while
nose
is
complex
some
of
your
typical
barley
wine
aromas
big
malt
hops
and
alcohol
a
bit
masked
in
this
one
but
yet
perfumy
thats
where
the
hops
are
fruity
and
estery
at
the
same
time
taste
is
a
bit
subdued
not
as
aggressive
as
other
barley
wines
ive
had
but
thats
good
its
fruitiness
is
kept
to
an
appreciative
threshhold
very
tasty
mouthfeel
is
delicate
and
intricate
with
its
minimal
carbonation
despite
its
fluffy
and
lacy
head
drinkability
is
good
considering
its
style
i
also
had
the
pleasure
of
this
mighty
brew
on
cask
at
the
toad
aged
2
years
this
had
really
come
into
its
own
not
as
raw
as
the
bottle
fresh
version
poured
a
hazy
mahogony
color
with
a
little
bit
of
white
head
smell
was
great
with
huge
esters
seeping
down
my
nostrils
and
tickling
my
throat
along
with
a
serious
bit
of
piney
hops
to
balance
out
the
huge
malted
notes
taste
was
like
drinking
carbonated
molassas
it
was
so
tasty
with
huge
rolling
waves
of
caramel
and
molassas
sweetness
morphing
into
pure
brown
sugar
coupled
with
a
more
subdued
hop
taste
and
huge
notes
of
alcohol
this
was
a
rare
treat
and
perfect
for
the
gathering
big
thanks
to
mccall
for
this
one
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
brews
pours
a
dirty
tan
head
holds
up
better
than
most
middle
ages
its
a
cloudy
dark
amber
beer
with
a
slight
orange
hue
smells
like
a
sweet
worthers
original
this
beer
is
just
so
damn
smooth
how
strong
is
it
oh
man
be
careful
this
is
like
liquid
crack
highly
addictive
theres
a
butterscotchhoppyness
to
the
taste
very
interesting
its
gone
where
am
i
gonna
score
my
next
fix
thanks
to
wrxbeerwagon
for
this
had
this
on
tap
at
the
blue
tusk
in
syracuse
not
too
long
ago
and
glad
to
try
it
again
deep
amber
brown
body
with
a
beautiful
light
tan
head
smells
of
sweet
toffee
cookie
dough
with
a
subtle
hop
presence
taste
is
dominated
by
the
sweet
cookie
dough
malts
at
first
but
is
balanced
nicely
by
citrusy
spicy
hops
lingering
bitterness
and
alcohol
this
is
a
big
and
syrupy
beer
but
thankfully
its
not
too
cloying
this
pours
a
nice
medium
brown
with
a
little
orange
tint
to
it
with
a
real
nice
creamyrocky
head
that
sticks
very
wellnot
much
of
an
aroma
some
light
fruitiness
and
alcohol
smell
to
it
taste
is
nice
and
and
almost
whiskylike
with
some
dried
fruit
flavors
with
a
dryish
finish
a
real
nice
beer
from
a
brewery
i
like
to
drink
from
when
in
buffalo
visiting
the
future
inlaws
theres
a
lot
of
bitter
in
this
one
as
others
have
noted
grapefruit
flavors
dominate
i
have
a
friggin
grapefruit
tree
if
i
want
grapefruit
juice
i
can
squeeze
it
fresh
this
tastes
almost
like
a
mediocre
west
coast
ipa
its
nice
but
not
a
barleywine
from
my
tastebuds
pov
the
flavor
delivers
more
fruit
and
less
hop
flavor
than
the
aroma
suggests
it
starts
with
the
big
juicy
fruit
that
the
aroma
exhibits
apple
apricot
plum
cherry
almost
pineapple
but
not
so
sour
followed
by
some
soft
buttery
caramel
and
mineral
character
as
it
warms
and
finishes
with
leafypiney
hop
flavors
a
bold
bitterness
some
dry
woody
characater
and
a
touch
of
mildly
peppery
alcohol
the
aftertaste
is
a
long
and
winding
road
where
the
different
flavors
previously
encountered
reappear
again
and
again
at
different
points
most
complex
and
quite
enjoyable
and
the
ringwood
yeast
really
stands
out
here
a
very
unique
barleywine
from
syracuse
ny
youre
greeted
with
a
dark
amber
brew
with
smallish
tan
head
candy
sugar
with
some
raisinprune
aromas
mingle
with
earthy
hops
butterscotch
and
belgian
mustiness
the
flavors
lean
toward
fresh
earthy
hops
with
some
sweet
sugary
malt
and
finishes
with
a
strong
bitterness
it
has
a
medium
body
holding
the
complex
hop
flavors
now
ive
got
it
the
hops
have
a
minty
herbal
quality
that
was
hard
to
pin
down
and
fruity
flavors
like
apples
and
peaches
an
interesting
route
to
follow
for
a
barleywine
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
that
remains
and
laces
the
aroma
is
of
fruity
ringwood
yeast
hops
and
multiple
malts
the
taste
is
extremely
smooth
with
a
little
warming
but
overall
good
balance
between
hops
and
malts
the
body
is
medium
its
not
at
all
hard
to
swallow
like
some
barley
wines
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
an
excellant
choice
but
not
as
good
as
bigfoot
barley
wine
lovely
beer
pours
a
messy
white
head
beautifully
uneven
rich
copper
color
a
little
murky
excellent
lacing
smells
hoppy
and
rich
also
a
little
sweet
wonderful
aroma
tastes
hoppytoo
feels
a
little
thick
on
the
tongue
but
the
aroma
and
memory
of
the
taste
more
than
make
up
for
this
and
make
it
very
drinkable
really
delightful
stuff
and
staggeringly
drinkable
for
a
baby
barleywine
how
much
more
stately
can
this
become
with
age
i
am
a
big
beer
fanatic
and
have
several
hundred
vintage
ales
layed
down
whats
great
about
this
is
that
its
drinkable
as
soon
as
it
hits
the
shelves
i
found
the
complex
malt
quility
very
inviting
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
a
wounderful
bready
finish
have
this
with
a
piece
of
chocolate
and
injoy
i
suppose
ive
gotten
accustomed
to
massive
americaninfluenced
barley
wines
that
yank
out
your
tongue
and
stomp
on
it
a
few
times
druid
fluid
seemed
more
like
the
wellmannered
english
cousin
and
perhaps
more
like
a
strong
ale
while
this
beer
wont
snap
your
head
back
it
is
immensely
drinkable
overall
a
good
barley
wine
this
one
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
a
bit
more
aroma
and
body
and
this
could
be
a
great
barley
wine
imho
i
very
nice
intro
to
barley
wines
for
the
beginner
thank
you
davo
deep
goldenorangish
in
color
nose
is
quite
interesting
juicy
hops
and
butterscotch
combination
taste
is
definitely
juicy
hops
up
front
with
that
butterscotch
flavor
on
the
finish
not
real
thick
and
rich
alcohol
bites
a
little
but
seems
pretty
hidden
an
interesting
twist
to
the
types
of
barley
wines
ive
tried
definitely
worth
trying
i
prefer
a
bit
more
body
and
tickness
to
my
barley
wines
but
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
either
480
the
ultimate
delight
to
see
a
barley
wine
all
murky
and
masculine
sitting
in
the
glass
the
massive
light
tan
head
floating
on
that
reddishpurple
liquid
and
the
nose
robust
nay
i
say
sinewy
lusty
vigorous
are
words
needed
to
describe
this
beer
fusel
alcohol
over
ripe
pineapple
corn
mash
lightly
sweet
and
oh
so
pleasant
an
aroma
for
the
schnozzle
thick
malt
at
the
front
the
top
muscular
the
finish
alcohol
bitter
and
the
hops
devastating
in
their
spicy
bite
potently
acidic
aftertaste
dry
and
alcohol
bitter
oh
yeah
baby
i
love
it
notes
yeah
i
just
want
to
say
juicy
fruit
again
this
beer
does
not
surprise
me
coming
from
this
brewery
i
expected
something
of
this
greatness
to
come
fro
them
notes
a
very
englishlike
barleywine
with
very
complex
characters
that
are
not
typical
of
your
usmade
variety
well
worth
a
try
if
youre
looking
for
a
big
beer
thats
different
damn
tasty
this
is
a
kick
ass
strong
beer
sip
with
caution
the
smell
is
great
with
a
nice
feel
to
the
mouth
not
really
any
head
because
of
the
caskcondition
but
a
little
white
head
was
created
at
first
white
lace
is
left
behind
on
the
glass
after
drinking
all
of
it
overall
a
yummy
tasting
beer
outstanding
barley
wine
frightningly
drinkable
impressive
and
powerful
barleywine
glad
i
aged
it
though
the
fundamental
muscular
character
isnt
going
to
ever
age
out
of
this
beer
while
not
as
complex
as
i
expected
this
is
s
perfect
afterdinner
treat
on
a
winter
day
that
said
a
little
goes
a
long
way
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
it
actually
reminds
me
a
lot
of
aged
real
ale
sisyphus
which
is
a
criminally
underrated
barelywine
in
texas
always
a
treat
to
drink
and
i
am
glad
i
have
had
the
chance
to
try
it
on
many
different
occasions

amazing
p
s
the
bottle
presentation
is
the
best
ive
ever
seen
truly
a
work
of
art
sorry
to
see
they
wont
be
packaging
it
like
this
anymore
but
happy
to
have
a
few
vintages
in
my
cellar
to
admire
and
enjoy
need
more
bottles
for
science
must
age
for
comparison
this
is
a
great
barleywine
the
most
impressive
thing
is
that
it
tastes
great
even
young
this
will
only
improve
in
time
this
is
hard
to
get
but
its
worth
seeking
out
overall
this
is
outstanding
its
not
a
complicated
barleywine
instead
its
simple
sweet
and
mellow
overall
tasty
american
barleywine
complex
with
a
lot
of
different
sources
of
sweetness
to
it
the
hops
are
clearly
secondary
to
the
malts
which
is
what
i
like
in
a
nonba
barleywine
thanks
for
this
one
matt
overall
this
is
really
really
good
its
very
complex
and
the
cooperation
between
the
sweet
malts
bitter
hops
and
boozy
alcohol
works
very
well
together
although
it
doesnt
get
in
the
way
per
se
its
still
quite
hot
at
the
moment
so
giving
it
some
time
might
be
a
good
idea
id
like
to
get
another
bottle
to
sit
on
for
a
couple
years
or
even
just
get
an
older
bottle
of
this
to
try
out
probably
34
years
would
be
the
sweet
spot
cheers
again
cparles
this
was
great
o
nice
mildly
hoppy
barleywine
great
layers
of
complexity
that
are
quite
well
balanced
big
and
heavy
without
being
too
sweet
or
boozy
though
some
barrel
aging
would
certainly
accentuate
this
one
i
think
still
delicious
any
way
you
slice
it
a
good
advertisement
for
aging
such
a
joy
to
drink
not
overly
complicated
just
seamlessly
integrated
thanks
in
large
part
to
the
mellowing
effects
of
age
on
the
pungent
barleywine
yeast
and
alpha
acid
character
overall
the
best
barelywine
i
have
ever
tasted
so
so
much
flavor
i
feel
lucky
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
it
o
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
had
rich
and
complex
but
extremely
smooth
and
easy
drinking
for
style
and
abv
fantastic
creamy
slick
and
oily
fully
bodied
and
filling
o
very
good
american
barleywine
very
sweet
and
citrusy
beer
that
has
a
great
mouthfeel
i
wish
i
have
had
this
fresh
to
compare
if
it
has
more
bitterness
and
any
other
differences
its
a
very
wellmade
barleywine
long
finish
and
heady
strength
but
the
aroma
wouldnt
justify
that
remark
im
more
and
more
tempted
to
crack
my
07
bottle
every
day
poured
perfectly
clear
deep
maple
almost
brown
but
beautiful
honey
hues
in
the
light
creamy
long
lasting
head
with
multiple
trails
of
lace
very
nicely
balanced
aromas
of
caramel
creme
and
grapefruit
zest
reminds
me
almost
of
a
creamsicle
very
briefly
but
then
turns
into
english
toffee
butterscotch
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
the
forefront
is
sweet
and
fruity
leading
to
a
mid
palate
burst
of
molasses
toffee
raisins
and
finishing
with
rum
and
citrusy
hops
perfect
carbonation
for
this
style
and
flavor
profile
absolutely
amazing
barleywine
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
and
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
citrus
zest
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
some
nice
barleywine
aromas
and
flavors
o
solid
barleywine
that
definitely
leans
towards
the
bready
and
malty
side
worth
trying
a
bottle
if
you
can
get
ahold
of
one
overall
good
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
huge
bubbly
beige
head
that
persists
forever
upon
first
pour
i
and
assaulted
with
aromas
of
tropical
fruits
upon
closer
inspection
i
get
lots
of
toffee
brown
sugar
caramel
and
dark
dried
fruits
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
a
faint
bit
of
earthy
hop
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
sweet
with
just
enough
ethanol
and
earthy
to
provide
some
balance
flavors
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
mixed
with
cherries
and
plums
go
down
quite
smooth
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
syrupy
bubbly
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
nice
barleywine
i
wish
i
could
try
it
a
bit
fresher
but
i
quite
enjoyed
this
aged
version
today
big
thanks
goes
out
to
jackthebear
for
sharing
this
one
during
the
one
year
anniversary
of
my
wreck
tasting
2010
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
crooked
stave
crooked
line
tulip
poured
a
hazy
redorange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
caramel
hop
and
earth
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
caramel
hop
earth
and
wood
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
nothing
with
the
exception
of
the
aroma
really
stood
out
to
me
on
this
one
while
the
aroma
wasnt
really
complex
at
all
it
was
still
fairly
well
balanced
and
inviting
i
just
wish
the
flavor
would
have
followed
suit
much
closer
the
flavor
wasnt
bad
by
any
means
but
it
definitely
wasnt
one
of
the
best
from
the
style
that
ive
had
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
do
so
2009
vintage
the
bottle
was
split
wit
2
friends
poured
into
tumbers
the
pour
was
deep
red
slight
white
head
the
aroma
was
sweet
ton
of
caramel
notes
fruity
vanilla
it
is
very
sweet
vanilla
figs
dark
fruits
finishes
with
a
pleasant
sweetness
gratitude
is
thick
light
carbonation
i
did
not
notice
the
alcohol
i
really
enjoyed
it
although
it
was
too
sweet
for
one
of
my
friends
right
now
it
is
drinking
like
an
english
barley
wine
pours
deep
ruby
red
with
a
1
finger
off
white
head
smells
of
figs
with
some
caramel
apple
taste
starts
off
very
fruity
green
apples
pear
and
fig
come
to
mind
then
ends
with
a
nice
sweet
presence
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
and
carbonation
is
in
there
but
soft
overall
this
beer
blew
my
mind
the
first
time
i
had
it
and
this
time
achieved
nothing
less
outstanding
beer
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
and
flavors
all
balance
amazingly
together
4
255
overall
im
kicking
myself
for
playing
the
waiting
game
a
little
too
long
i
have
to
wonder
if
even
a
few
months
may
have
made
a
significant
difference
in
the
overall
quality
definitely
still
a
great
beer
and
its
got
a
heavier
body
with
a
big
abv
so
its
not
something
any
one
is
going
to
plow
through
it
wont
be
easy
but
ill
find
it
within
myself
to
drink
the
whole
thing
down
cost
25
for
a
750
ml
bottle
o
interesting
and
unique
barleywine
but
drinkability
is
hurt
a
bit
by
the
sweetness
and
heavy
body
wows
initially
but
over
the
course
of
an
hour
sipping
the
beer
theres
plenty
of
time
to
pick
up
on
flaws
which
are
masked
in
the
first
impressions
the
palate
opens
full
in
body
and
lightly
carbonated
with
mildly
bitter
piney
hops
with
brown
sugar
raisins
toffee
and
a
really
nice
burnt
sugar
flavor
as
well
mild
maple
sugar
is
present
sweet
on
the
finish
with
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
present
this
is
very
nice
thankfully
this
isnt
a
crystal
malt
bomb
like
some
other
american
barleywines
ive
had
recently
overall
really
good
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
tasted
no
need
for
a
barrel
to
make
this
one
spectacular
o
i
guessed
this
correctly
while
i
was
taking
notes
a
nice
take
on
a
american
barleywines
with
plenty
of
dark
fruit
and
citrus
notes
not
overly
sweet
or
hop
forward
which
i
enjoyed
poured

glass
pours
burnt
amber
red
sweet
grape
caramel
and
classic
barley
wine
aromatics
flavor
of

some

and
this
reminded
me
of
a
mutedtoned
down
version
of
three
floyds
collaboration
with
mikkeller
oatgoop
thin
mouthfeel
with
decent
carbonation
throughout
this
brew
actually
tastes
better
when
approaching
room
temperature
overall
this
was
a
little
disappointing
despite
its
high
ratings
i
expected
more
out
of
this
one
2007
release
with
the
yellow
wax
purchased
at
the
brewery
in
2009
this
one
had
to
be
the
toughest
wax
ive
ever
encountered
on
a
beer
bottle
once
i
got
it
open
it
poured
a
dark
cloudy
dark
copper
color
there
was
a
large
tan
head
on
it
that
didnt
linger
too
long
no
lacing
somewhat
sweet
nose
caramel
honey
some
spices
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
sublime
a
slight
slickness
on
the
tongue
very
smooth
taste
this
has
aged
quite
well
caramel
spice
fruits
slightly
sweet
yet
a
subtle
bit
of
bitterness
back
there
dont
know
how
widely
this
is
distributed
but
well
worth
searching
out
of
you
get

pittsburgh

gratitude
pours
an
opaque
mahogany
four
fingers
or
so
of
light
tan
foam
rise
up
to
crown
the
beer
displaying
good
head
retention
lacing
forms
nearly
a
solid
ring
at
the
apex
but
is
extremely
spotty
below
the
nose
has
lots
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
with
a
noticeable
nuttiness
to
it
as
well
its
just
a
touch
dweak
in
intensity
though
the
flavor
is
much
more
robust
with
notes
of
fruity
cherries
and
some
sherry
from
the
oxidation
jumping
out
the
malty
base
of
the
beer
accounts
itself
with
more
brown
sugar
and
caramel
if
anything
id
say
that
the
malty
base
is
a
touch
too
much
in
the
background
as
far
as
balance
in
the
flavor
profile
goes
the
cherry
is
a
little
bit
unexpected
maybe
particularly
estery
fermentation
but
works
out
nicely
with
everything
else
the
body
isnt
is
rich
and
full
as
i
might
have
anticipated
which
does
work
well
in
making
this
beer
drink
easier
but
i
like
the
mouthfeel
for
a
barleywine
to
have
a
certain
luxuriant
quality
the
carbonation
is
very
nice
and
muted
just
barely
enough
to
carbonate
the
beer
gratitude
is
a
very
nice
offering
for
one
of
my
favorite
styles
o
solid
barleywine
but
a
bit
disappointing
i
imagine
the
sweetness
dies
down
in
the
older
vintages
i
was
expecting
something
fuller

the

low
carbonation
overall
a
great
barleywine
that
i
enjoyed
quite
a
bit
does
it
live
up
to
it
hype
nope
but
i
have
been
spoiled
by
a
wealth
of
barrelaged
barleywines
lately
still
i
was
so
happy
to
finally
scratch
this
bad
boy
off
my
list
d
very
good
o
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
making
this
quite
easy
to
drink
but
definitely
a
sipper
taste
is
balanced
and
mellow
good
bitterness
and
a
nice
hoppy
rich
bite
on
the
end
the
finish
is
really
good
md
smooth
for
such
a
big
beer
complex
layers
of
sweetness
the
year
on
it
seemed
to
help
it
immensely
wish
i
could
get
this
one
without
the
necessary
trade
overall
this
is
my
first
experience
with
this
beer
which
is
crazy
because
my
sister
went
to
college
in
pittsburgh
for
3
5
years
how
did
i
not
know
about
this
brewery
and
make
here
get
me
bottles
poor
job
by
me
anyway
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
when
compared
to
the
greats
of
the
stle
it
falls
a
bit
short
for
me
i
would
much
rather
have
and
alaskan
barley
wine
which
i
believe
is
the
gold
standard
for
the
style
it
is
much
more
readily
available
or
accessable
via
trade
or
online
order
from
various
shops
this
is
a
viscous
and
heavy
in
flavor
which
is
good
and
bad
would
like
a
tad
more
carbonation
to
balance
the
heft
the
alcohol
becomes
a
bit
overbearing
towards
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
so
overall
while
this
was
very
good
i
have
to
say
this
is
not
worth
trading
a
great
deal
for
given
the
rarity
and
the
price
of
vintage
editions
ive
had
almost
every
vintage
since
and
its
always
a
pleasure
different
nuances
come
out
every
year
ages
well
and
is
always
surprising
when
someone
is
gracious
enough
to
open
a
bottle
overall
impression
splendid
easily
one
of
the
best
of
its
kind
o
really
impressed
for
how
old
this
one
is
it
was
a
nice
surprise
to
try
the
2005
as
it
was
the
only
vintage
i
havent
had
i
would
think
the
20062007
would
be
drinking
phenomenally
right
now
and
would
like
to
try
them
to
compare
a
very
nice
barleywine
overall
this
is
a
review
of
the
yellow
was
bottle
i
was
expecting
great
things
but
having
had
a
goose
island
king
henry
recently
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
ill
likely
fill
out
this
review
with
my
notes
on
0609
when
i
figure
out
where
i
put
them
o
all
in
all
bravo
this
is
a
balanced
barleywine
that
hides
the
high
abv
very
well
if
you
like
a
good
strong
sweet
brew
then
this
is
for
you
i
highly
recommend
and
will
be
hunting
down
more
bottles
for
myself
drink
joe
you
are
a
stud
for
this
onei
probably
wont
trade
for
this
one
seeing
as
i
dont
have
the
ammo
but
for
one
night
i
had
some
of
this
bad
boy
overall
not
what
i
was
expecting
to
be
blunt
an
interesting
barleywine
with
no
alcohol
heat
or
flavors
to
speak
of
oddly
i
wanted
to
warm
it
up
a
bit
like
cider
haha
wish
it
had
some
more
carbonation
have
another
2010
in
the
cellar
ill
sit
on
for
a
few
years
to
see
how
it
changes
overall
this
has
aged
wonderfully
cant
wait
for
this
years
release
early
next
year
getting
a
lot
more
of
it
this
time
for
sure
its
miles
better
than
it
was
at
release
and
i
thought
it
was
pretty
damn
good
then
overall
i
was
happy
to
be
able
to
try
this
one
it
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
expectations
i
had
built
up
in
my
head
but
still
a
very
nice
beer
recommended
wow
this
is
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
ever
had
it
has
aged
perfectly
and
has
a
very
complex
and
satisfying
taste
excellent
overall
i
was
pretty
underwhelmed
by
this
one
it
is
a
good
beer
but
it
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
the
smell
was
a
bit
weird
this
poured
out
as
a
deep
orange
color
the
head
was
minimal
intact
it
was
just
a
thin
white
film
on
top
of
the
beer
i
believe
the
vintage
was
2009
on
this
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
sweet
good
amount
of
hops
on
the
nose
and
some
boozy
aromas
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
sweet
with
some
fruity
notes
and
more
booze
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
overall
this
beer
was
really
quite
nice
had
on
tap
in
a
9
oz
snifter
at
capones
black
friday
event
pours
a
brilliant
ruby
bronze
color
with
no
head
nose
is
rich
with
vanilla
and
bourbon
notes
the
taste
is
also
rife
with
alcohol
bourbon
vanilla
and
grapes
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
smooth
very
alcoholic
but
outstanding
i
love
this
stuff
overall
the
most
consistent
barleywine
out
there
they
year
after
year
put
out
a
quality
annv
beer
that
shows
their
gratitude
and
what
a
beer
they
produce
i
believe
with
3
years
in
the
cellar
it
matures
wonderfully
i
have
yet
to
have
any
of
their
vintages
that
taste
like
its
gone
down
hill
plus
its
one
of
the
prettiest
bottles
ever
made
must
seek
out
the
only
other
bw
that
beats
this
is
wooden
hell
cheers
i
dont
think
east
end
brewing
could
offer
a
more
suitable
beer
to
show
their
gratitude
for
their
loyal
customers
every
bit
the
effort
and
attention
to
detail
that
was
put
into
the
presentation
was
clearly
also
put
into
the
beer
this
is
for
my
money
one
of
the
most
bewitching
barleywines
out
there
and
is
a
mustbuy
no
matter
the
cost
though
the
mouthfeel
is
a
disappointment
this
is
still
a
really
excellent
barleywine
id
actually
love
to
try
an
older
bottle
as
id
imagine
this
would
only
get
better
as
the
hops
mellow
out
more
that
said
the
2010
vintage
is
drinking
quite
well
right
now
overall
not
the
best
barleywine
i
have
ever
had
but
it
is
damn
good
this
is
my
first
time
trying
the
beer
so
not
sure
if
the
no
carbonation
is
standard
with
this
one
but
that
definitely
played
a
part
in
the
lower
score
i
feel
like
this
barleywine
quite
didnt
reach
its
potential
perhaps
with
better
carbonation
the
flavors
could
have
shined
more
overall
its
a
real
nice
beer
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
depth
in
character
for
the
limited
1500
bottle
release
also
top
3
coolest
bottles
ever
produced
overall
great
barleywine
id
love
to
compare
to
a
fresh
one
but
this
is
fantastic
great
lacing
great
taste
and
nose
overall
a
fantastic
brew
o
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
i
just
think
it
lost
a
little
with
this
year
perhaps
this
is
when
its
in
its
delicious
transition
phase
d
this
is
my
first
time
having
this
beer
however
based
on
reviews
id
say
another
year
would
have
been
the
time
to
open
it
this
would
give
a
little
more
time
for
the
hops
to
dissappear
completely
and
to
get
more
continuity
from
the
fruit
and
malt
that
being
said
glad
to
finally
land
this
one
as
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
barleywine
o
brilliant
from
packaging
to
the
end
this
rocked
reminded
me
a
lot
of
some
of
the
better
desert
wines
available
here
and
the
flavor
characters
well
hidden
abv
easy
to
drink
and
full
of
thick
jammy
flavors
going
to
have
to
trade
for
more
of
this
overall
a
very
good
barleywine
and
one
that
id
seek
out
more
often
thanks
to
mulder1010
for
opening
this
equivalent
of
beer
porn
lovely
bottle
lovely
contents
a
nice
warming
rich
and
flavoursome
barleywine
overall
obviously
it
was
quite
a
treat
and
a
good
beer
however
for
what
i
imagine
it
would
require
to
obtain
im
not
sure
id
go
for
it
again
o
all
three
vintages
of
this
brew
are
delicious
this
beer
seems
to
be
the
type
that
will
bring
out
different
flavors
at
different
points
of
aging
i
really
cant
thank
al
enough
for
breaking
out
the
05
to
09
vertical
at
the
event
it
was
wonderful
to
get
to
sample
all
the
vintages
that
i
otherwise
would
have
never
been
able
to
try
easily
one
off
the
best
barleywines
ive
ever
sampled
in
complete
disclosure
the
05
was
my
favorite
followed
by
07
an
outstanding
series
from
east
end
2009
goofy
stage
big
time
overall
a
decent
barleywine
but
nothing
crazy
i
expected
a
little
more
after
seeing
all
the
high
scores
still
enjoyable
however
tastes
are
medicinal
toffee
oaky
tastes
toasted
malt
smoke
booze
flaked
barley
hops
dextrose
soy
an
aged
beer
amber
malt
oranges
and
spice
smell
are
booze
more
booze
toasted
barley
strong

oak
rye
steel
shirt
zest
light

and

definitely
a
sipper
o
very
smooth
and
tasty
barley
wine
complex
with
a
lot
of
different
tastes
going
on
well
balancedi
recommend
this
one
for
any
barley
wine
lovers
out
there
d
great
first
gratitude
ive
been
able
to
try
and
i
really
like
it
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
an
orange
tint
a
good
amount
of
head
hugging
the
rim
smooth
and
thick
very
rich
and
thick
a
very
nice
malty
spicy
nose
tastes
smooth
and
malty
sweet
rich
thick
and
very
spicy
i
love
the
flavour
profile
can
taste
a
touch
of
oxidized
flavours
but
they
sit
nicely
with
the
brew
nice
thick
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
solid
brew
im
glad
my
first
experience
is
a
3
year
aged
bottle
the
appearance
is
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
its
smell
has
plums
caramel
some
hops
too
enticing
overall
gratitude
tastes
sweet
with
toffee
more
plums
brown
sugar
but
also
has
malt
and
hops
present
mf
is
full
rich
it
is
a
one
to
enjoy
over
time
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
from
a
relatively
small
scale
brewery
creamy
chewy
full
body
with
an
excellent
balance
of
leathery
and
sweet
malt
booze
dark
fruit
and
earthy
hops
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
onenof
the
best
ive
encountered
in
the
style
slightly
earthy
with
lots
of
sweet
malt
going
off
hints
of
caramel
toffee
hazelnut
rye
and
biscuit
there
are
some
earthy
hops
balancing
thing
out
especially
in
the
finish
whichns
long
dry
and
slightly
bitter
very
well
balanced
and
extremely
quaffable
with
faint
hints
of
dark
fruit
especially
plum
and
raisin
the
alcohol
sweetness
is
there
but
it
isnt
hot
at
all
and
the
high
abv
is
excellently
masked
making
it
deceptively
drinkable
highly
recommended
drinkability
an
excellent
sipper
and
a
sincere
toast
of
gratitude
to
the
guys
of
bcc
who
made
my
first
trip
th
the
upper
gauley
fantastic
thanks
to
paulmpap
for
hooking
me
up
with
a
most
memorable
brew
to
put
the
finishing
touch
on
a
most
memorable
weekend
do
drinkability
is
moderate
honestly
i
was
a
little
bit
let
down
by
this
bottle
after
reading
other
reviews
of
various
vintages
it
seems
that
this
is
the
most
aggressively
hopped
version
so
im
hoping
some
time
in
the
cellar
will
tame
the
hops
and
smooth
out
the
alcohol
on
this
its
still
fairly
young
for
a
barleywine
of
this
magnitude
so
i
will
be
holding
onto
a
few
bottles
of
this
to
crack
later
but
if
you
have
any
of
the
2010
laying
around
i
would
recommend
sitting
on
them
for
a
few
months
at
the
least
o
just
an
amazing
beer
dedicated
to
a
great
guy
and
great
beer
advocate
good
barleywine
nothing
outstanding
ill
age
one
and
see
what
happens
pours
a
hazy
amber
to
orangeish
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
dark
fruit
and
a
hint
of
licorice
in
the
taste
dark
fruit
licorice
and
a
small
caramel
like
presence
a
smooth
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
plum
and
caramel
like
aftertaste
hides
the
alcohol
with
big
dark
fruit
with
a
nice
caramel
like
stickiness
overall
very
surprised
at
the
vast
differences
between
the
vintages
while
i
was
expecting
some
variation
each
of
these
beers
presented
quite
differently
much
more
so
than
expected
at
this
point
it
was
rather
the
most
disappointing
of
the
3
it
had
a
bready
yeast
like
quality
to
it
still
i
assume
that
it
would
probably
improve
with
age
it
had
a
regular
barleywine
like
quality
too
it
and
i
actually
found
it
to
have
very
little
on
spicing
and
complexity
yet
overall
and
i
speak
for
all
three
bottles
here
this
is
a
damn
fine
barleywine
something
i
can
see
wanting
to
enjoy
again
in
the
future
very
much
so
get
some
side
note
it
would
really
be
nice
to
see
this
barrel
aged
the
actual
bourbon
could
really
play
off
the
sweet
boozy
taste
on
this
one
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
it
is
always
tough
to
live
up
to
the
hype
but
this
is
not
overhopped
for
a
one
year
old
barleywine
and
is
pretty
well
rounded
and
smooth
medium
mouthfeel
and
absolutely
no
carbonation
the
carbonation
that
is
there
simply
keeps
it
from
tasting
stale
overall
decent
not
as
great
as
i
expected
but
still
good
from
what
i
hear
the
09
version
was
much
better
but
this
was
def
tasty
just
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
imo
o
damn
i
have
had
some
of
the
newer
vintages
of
gratitude
before
but
the
05
and
06
are
easily
the
best
i
have
had
the
07
and
08
are
well
on
there
way
as
well
but
the
original
two
are
already
there
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
had
in
quite
some
time
possibly
even
the
best
ever
thanks
again
al
a
beer
that
i
am
happy
to
have
saved
for
a
special
occasion
i
hope
i
am
able
to
get
more
of
this
beer
in
the
future
drinkability
is
quite
good
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
overly
hop
forward
like
most
american
barleywines
but
its
actually
much
closer
to
any
an
english
barleywine
at
least
this
vintage
is
the
nose
isnt
too
bad
not
quite
on
par
with
some
other
barleywines
but
the
taste
is
an
excellent
mixture
of
light
fruit
and
vanilla
the
body
is
exceptional
i
love
the
feel
of
this
beer
perfect
for
a
barleywine
also
the
11
5
abv
is
masked
quite
well
this
is
definitely
a
top
5
barleywine
for
me
and
worth
seeking
out
i
know
ill
be
looking
for
more
nice
work
east
end
overall
this
is
really
making
me
want
to
invest
in
the
vertical
probably
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
d
entirely
too
drinkable
and
enjoyable
to
drink
good
flavor
and
easy
to
sip
this
barleywine
is
dangerous
beers
like
gratitude
moas
are
the
reason
barleywines
are
my
favorite
style
this
has
aged
very
gracefully
and
i
could
see
this
aging
at
least
another
3
years
i
am
very
happy
i
had
the
chance
to
get
some
of
this
side
note
they
said
the
carbonation
was
due
to
the
keg
but
during
the
end
of
the
happy
hour
was
shook
up
to
reveal
a
nice
half
inch
of
foam
on
new
fills
too
bad
i
didnt
save
this
for
my
last
offering
since
my
only
complaint
was
no
carbonation
or
head
this
is
one
i
will
have
to
revisit
again
though
and
give
another
chance
to
see
if
our
bottle
was
just
under
carbed
zero
signs
of
oxidation
or
drying
up
for
that
matter
if
you
like
a
sweeter
unhopped
barleywine
this
ones
for
you
too
sweet
for
me
and
definately
needs
some
hopping
all
the
way
through
d
this
is
a
spectacular
offering
from
east
end
a
heavy
and
full
bodied
beer
that
will
age
extremely
well
very
very
nice
and
i
have
to
say
this
beer
has
held
up
very
well
over
the
years
im
guessing
this
beer
could
easily
go
another
3
to
5
years
without
losing
a
thing
impressive
bw
from
east
end
i
must
say
skal
pours
a
golden
copper
minimal
beige
head
smells
heavily
of
fruit
and
sweet
malt
smelled
like
pears
and
flowers
taste
was
very
similar
with
a
minimal
citrus
hint
i
got
a
lot
of
rasins
and
pears
from
this
with
some
honey
and
rose
carbonation
was
a
little
high
but
worked
for
me
mouthfeel
was
good
and
while
thick
was
still
very
drinkable
i
really
like
this
beer
i
hope
i
get
to
try
it
again
poured
into
a
tulip
dark
amber
and
slightly
hazy
with
a
about
a
finger
of
off
white
head
that
retains
nicely
really
nice
smell
on
this
one
rich
and
fruity
with
a
nice
caramel
finish
that
blends
nicely
with
a
raisin
aroma
im
pleasantly
surprised
that
the
alcohol
is
unnoticeable
at
11
5
the
flavors
are
a
lot
like
the
nose
full
and
fruity
with
a
dominant
raisin
profile
and
a
twinge
of
caramel
sweetness
to
round
it
all
out
the
mouthfeel
is
great
too
silky
on
the
tongue
with
just
a
bit
of
sharp
carbonation
to
it
a
little
boozy
on
the
pallet
but
its
really
just
warm
overall
this
one
is
stellar
2009
batch
blue
tasted
january
2011
pours
a
very
clear
garnet
with
a
thin
ring
of
head
nose
is
heavy
sticky
malt
some
honey
reminds
me
more
of
an
old
ale
bright
citrus
and
pine
in
the
mouth
a
nice
sweet
finish
of
orange
candy
the
citrus
is
a
bit
at
odds
here
i
feel
like
the
malt
element
of
this
batch
wasnt
quite
as
strong
as
some
others
were
the
weakest
vintage
ive
had
d
extremely
smooth
very
nice
definitely
lived
up
to
expectations
great
barleywine
edit
i
have
since
had
an
06
and
an
08
bottle
of
this
beer
and
none
were
as
good
as
the
original
review
i
still
like
this
beer
a
lot
but
its
not
a
4
54
5554
5
to
me
anymore
this
is
a
full
bodied
brew
with
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
very
drinkable
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
strange
in
this
brew
it
doesnt
look
all
that
carbonated
but
it
has
a
little
pop
to
the
feel
on
the
tongue
up
until
recently
i
have
only
enjoyed
the
2009
version
which
is
what
this
review
is
base
off
of
i
recently
got
to
try
a
bottle
from
2007
care
of
clockworkorange
and
wow
is
that
even
better
you
should
seek
this
one
out
750ml
waxed
and
papered
bottle

2010
vintage
pours
a
honey
amber
with
no
head
and
a
murky
clarity
nose
suggests
candied
dark
fruit
perhaps
prunes
taste
follows
nose
with
the
addition
of
a
slightly
spicy
character
as
well
something
vaguely
metallic
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
mild
even
carbonation
this
beer
tastes
quite
good
even
being
quite
young
i
would
relish
the
opportunity
to
try
a
bottle
with
a
few
years
of
age
on
it
it
can
only
get
better
in
my
opinion
d
definitely
a
sipper
and
i
cant
imagine
wanting
another
glass
of
this
anytime
soon
if
there
was
an
actual
disappointment
in
the
stellar
lineup
of
beers
i
sampled
on
friday
it
was
this
but
what
a
glorious
disappointment
as
barleywine
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
an
excellent
representation
of
the
genre
i
found
it
most
drinkable
gratitude
comes
to
me
looking
confrused
because
there
is
no
head
up
above
to
protect
the
lucious
liquid
in
the
glass
there
is
a
swirl
of
foam
here
and
there
but
nothing
that
i
can
call
a
cap
or
even
a
sparse
cap
no
lacing
obviously
smell
is
a
bunch
of
fruit
dipped
in
caramel
apricots
are
up
front
with
some
plum
fig
and
yes
some
alcohol
this
is
the
09
vintage
by
the
way
taste
is
superb
but
this
loses
something
off
the
tap
a
big
malting
causes
for
a
big
display
of
caramel
i
did
not
pick
up
the
werthers
quality
that
i
found
in
the
bottle
sweet
caramel
sided
with
apricot
plum
slight
apple
and
cherry
figs
fruits
you
know
what
it
is
yes
the
alcohol
pokes
its
ugly
head
out
but
it
does
not
distract
from
the
beer
i
think
it
boosts
its
flavor
profile
some
the
feel
seems
a
bit
thinner
than
out
of
the
bottle
its
a
big
medium
feel
that
is
slick
and
leaves
some
fruit
and
alc
on
the
tounge
afterwards
carb
is
there
but
seems
tame
all
in
all
i
prefer
my
gratitude
out
the
bottle
but
its
no
slouch
off
the
tap
as
well
i
drank
my
glass
with
ease
thanks
matt
and
bill
for
making
this
happen
drinkability
the
bit
of
booze
this
one
shows
and
the
small
lack
of
body
holds
it
back
but
this
is
a
world
class
barley
wine
none
the
less
d
this
is
a
special
treat
to
see
this
on
draft
and
oh
boy
did
i
enjoy
it
that
being
said
i
do
prefer
the
bottle
version
of
this
brew
i
will
say
this
its
one
of
the
finest
bw
in
the
world
at
least
to
me
this
is
my
first
taste
of
vintage
gratitude
and
it
did
not
dissapoint
ive
heard
from
others
that
the
07
is
in
its
prime
but
this
bottle
seems
to
be
showing
signs
of
going
downhill
if
youre
holding
on
to
07
grat
i
would
suggest
drinking
sooner
rather
than
later
really
looking
forward
to
the
2010
release
muddy
caramel
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
the
walls
of
the
glass
the
mellow
alcohol
mixed
with
caramelized
malt
creates
a
ghostly
whiskey
aroma
taste
is
almost
similar
to
fresh
high
gravity
wort
but
never
cloyingly
sweet
rich
dark
fruits
and
caramel
swim
across
your
taste
buds
slightly
bitter
finish
from
whatever
hops
are
left
in
this
medium
mouthfeel
for
an
american
barleywine
sweet
slightly
bitter
and
decadent
d
a
slow
sipper
this
is
ideal
for
sharing
a
few
ways
i
would
enjoy
having
this
again
sometime
good
stuff
d
a
very
nice
barleywine
i
really
liked
the
taste
its
a
little
sweet
and
fruity
but
i
thought
it
was
great
and
not
too
sweet
very
easy
to
drink
consdering
the
abv
which
is
kind
of
dangerous
i
have
an
09
bottle
and
hope
its
as
smooth
as
the
07
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
mildly
hot
to
start
off
its
strong
and
forward
with
the
sweetness
of
the
whole
thing
it
finishes
a
little
dry
a
little
drier
than
i
would
like
there
is
no
bitterness
to
this
beer
at
all
i
guess
its
like
an
exaggerated
big
barleywine
all
of
the
hallmark
flavors
are
there
but
its
wasnt
the
easiest
thing
for
me
to
drink
overall
i
mostly
enjoyed
it
though
id
like
to
try
the
older
vintages
or
after
these
have
aged
some
more
bottle
poured
a
medium
amber
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
toffee
and
caramel
malt
with
sweet
malt
base
is
enjoyable
enough
for
style
taste
is
also
dominated
by
medium
sweet
toffee
notes
with
some
caramel
malt
and
a
sweet
finish
body
was
about
average
for
style
with
good
carbonation
with
no
apparent
alcohol
i
must
admit
that
while
this
beer
was
satisfying
it
was
definitely
below
my
expectation
no
dry
fruit
or
interesting
ester
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
big
props
to
east
end
for
constructing
it
and
for
doing
it
in
a
way
that
pays
homage
to
their
customer
base
classy
move
with
a
classy
beer
top
to
bottom
a
superb
beer
d
quite
drinkable
not
overly
sweet
like
some
barleywines
very
well
balanced
and
a
great
sipper
for
wuite
a
while
would
love
to
see
what
some
age
does
to
this
one
d
my
half
went
faster
than
i
was
expecting
and
i
was
trying
to
savor
it
this
is
something
ill
gladly
trade
for
again
probably
too
strong
to
want
an
entire
bottle
to
myself
this
time
of
year
this
one
has
plenty
of
life
left
in
it
pours
an
amberbrown
with
offwhite
head
lots
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
yet
quite
fruity
ive
never
tasted
a
barleywine
quite
like
this
in
a
good
way
though
still
some
noticible
hops
but
they
arent
dominating
anything
quite
smooth
and
very
drinkable
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
had
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
future
editions
of
this
enjoyable
but
the
06
and
07
vintages
i
tried
prior
to
this
one
were
quite
a
bit
better
maybe
this
just
needs
some
age
dconsidering
the
rarity
and
high
abv
of
this
one
i
guess
i
had
a
hard
time
giving
this
one
a
5
however
i
would
have
no
problem
sitting
down
on
a
cold
winter
night
and
polishing
off
a
bottle
by
myself
this
beer
is
outstanding
and
benefits
from
some
cellar
time
i
would
guess
overall
very
good
beer
im
not
sure
why
this
didnt
hit
my
sweet
spot
as
it
plainly
did
with
so
many
others
but
id
never
turn
one
of
these
down
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
making
this
quite
easy
to
drink
but
definitely
a
sipper
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
very
low
level
of
carbonation
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
but
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
too
low
for
my
taste
and
seemed
to
detract
from
the
beer
thanks
ken
for
sharing
and
picking
up
from
brewery
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
little
too
much
on
the
tart
sweet
side
and
i
have
tasted
better
barleywines
d
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
but
i
admit
im
biased
by
a
previous
experience
having
the
2007
at
a
tasting
with
no
expectations
that
beer
was
absolutely
stunning
this
one
isnt
quite
there
yet
but
i
am
confident
it
will
age
into
the
splendor
of
its
older
brother
the
one
major
ding
is
price
the
bottle
is
18
or
something
like
that
come
on
poured
a
murky
dark
brown
with
marron
highlights
with
a
thin
head
that
left
good
sticky
lacing
really
big
caramel
malt
aromas
with
brown
sugar
and
molasses
accemts
but
also
had
hints
of
booze
and
raisins
caramel
malts
also
dominate
the
flavor
with
molasses
brown
sugar
and
honey
accents
and
noticable
booze
that
does
not
want
to
be
hidden
medium
body
beer
with
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
that
had
a
sweet
boozy
slight
hop
bitter
finish
ive
had
the
ornage
and
green
wax
vintages
and
bot
have
been
quite
enjoyable
and
drinkable
but
are
on
the
sweet
side
d
pretty
drinkable
the
bitterness
helps
and
even
though
it
has
a
high
abv
its
not
that
bad
d
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
the
sweetness
was
too
much
for
my
tastes

wont

found

to
be
a

a

a

any

great
beer

i

nw
barleywine
tasty
will
buy
again
prefer
english
style
barleywines
but
this
was
good
not
excessively
hoppy
with
robust
flavor
o
definitely
an
american
barleywine
which
fairly
far
to
the
bitter
side
not
as
balanced
as
their
magnificent
péché
mortel
but
an
enjoyable
treat
on
this
bitter
cold
day
in
pennsylvania
o
one
hard
beer
to
score
ive
had
plenty
a
better
barleywine
but
i
tend
to
lean
towards
the
english
style
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
american
barleywine
but
shows
some
glimmers
of
the
english
style
matter
of
fact
strong
glimmers
the
appearance
was
really
lackluster
to
me
and
definitely
stopped
this
one
from
being
outstanding
the
smell
was

for
the
course
so
really
its
only
half
great

to
the

aroma
lots
of

flavor
is
similar
with

and
the
finish

good

depth
but
not
quite
to

level
overall
excellent
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
an
american
style
but
it
is
more
of
a
hybrid
i
would
say
it
actually
may
lean
toward
english
the
flavors
could
be
a
little
more
pronounced
i
would
probably
score
it
a
little
better
as
and
english
version
i
think
this
would
age
really
well
though
huge
barleywine
here
right
between
the
english
and
american
styles
how
canadian
its
copper
to
honey
colored
and
thick
the
head
holds
on
a
little
while
before
fading
to
ring
lacing
in
my
globe
the
nose
is
pretty
hoppy
but
more
bitterness
than
flavor
the
grain
is
big
and
flavorful
but
not
particularly
layered
or
dynamic
or
nuanced
its
pretty
one
dimensional
despite
its
size
it
doesnt
seem
real
diverse
to
me
thats
fine
because
the
hop
finish
is
insanely
big
its
super
bitter
and
punchy
and
long
lasting
when
it
warms
it
clashes
just
a
bit
with
the
booze
which
until
now
was
more
mellow
im
floored
by
its
effect
on
me
from
relatively
sober
to
relatively
blasted
in
twelve
ounces
not
easy
to
do
a
well
made
brew
but
less
enthralling
than
most
of
their
others
i
might
like
it
more
in
the
dead
of

than
i
do
now

wow
grab
this
beer
im
not
sure
when
this
was
bottled
but
i
was
told
it
had
some
age
to
it
the
bottle
has
1
and
0
marked
out
of
09
09
ive
been
told
in
canada
thats
a
date
but
in
the
us
where
i
am
its
just
a
batch
number
so
i
dont
know
if
this
is
batch
10
or
if
this
is
from
the
first
batch
i
know
they
only
brew
it
once
a
year
so
i
dont
think
they
are
up
to
batch
10
but
who
knows
can
someone
clarify
i
recently
spent
a
good
bit
of
time
drinking
belgian
ales
and
have
been
branching
out
to
barleywines
lately
so
far
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
the
mouthfeel
almost
reminded
me
of
a
belgium
but
with
a
little
less
carbination
the
hops
in
the
finish
rounded
out
the
fairly
strong
malts
up
front
a
beer
in
my
book
a
good
beer
that
probably
would
have
benefited
from
more
age
verall
a
rather
nice
drinking
barley
wine
it
is
big
in
flavor
without
being
both
too
dry
and
boozy
or
too
overly
sweet
a
nice
easier
drinking
one
o
it
is
a
sweet
barleywine
after
reading
the
bottle
it
seems
that
it
was
meant
to
be
a
hoppy
barleywine
i
wish
i
would
have
had
a
fresh
one
to
compare
it
to
i
think
it
was
already
aged
when
i
bought
it
this
beer
is
not
bad
but
towards
the
bottom
of
the
beers
i
have
tried
from
this
brewery
thus
far
all
in
all
for
my
first
barelywine
i
feel
that
this
was
a
wonderful
choice
based
on
this
experience
i
will
now
also
recommend
this
to
fellow
newbies
overall
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
a
dark
caramel
brown
murky
brew
with
about
two
fingers
of
tan
head
poured
into
a
goblet
i
like
huge
beers
as
much
as
the
next
craft
nerd
but
i
have
to
be
in
a
particular
mood
to
really
get
a
barleywine
to
truly
appreciate
the
experience
the
aroma
here
is
great
redolent
with
toffee
and
rum
notes
orchard
fruit
pinelike
hop
resins
and
another
nonspecific
tangy
spice
note
smells
hot
earthy
and
woody
but
with
an
overarching
malty
sweetness
the
palate
is
initially
rich
and
malty
burnt
brown
sugar
and
molasses
leather
and
walnuts
things
then
get
fruity
for
a
moment
candied
cherries
raisins
and
prunes
almost
floral
almond
extract
something
that
recalls
coconut
only
to
have
these
flavors
disappear
underneath
hot
spicy
alcohols
and
oak
reasonably
thick
and
syrupy
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
all
hop
resins
and
nutshells
this
one
is
a
tad
pungent
rather
woody
and
medicinal
and
i
think
some
aging
might
do
it
good
i
do
appreciate
the
aggressive
hopping
and
roasted
flavors
osolid
if
not
spectacular
barleywine
nice
sipping
overall
i
was
worried
this
bottle
had
sat
around
for
too
long
but
its
doing
great
it
could
probably
sit
for
a
few
more
years
and
develop
more
in
the
bottle
overall
its
a
warming
fruity
very
sweet
and
nutty
winter
ale
for
the
coldest
of
nights
id
love
to
see
some
barrel
variations
of
this
one
as
an
oaky
vanilla
or
oaky
vinous
sweetness
could
really
compliment
the
beer
great
winter
warmer
on
a
cold
day
alcohol
is
a
little
more
agressive
than
i
typically
like
but
its
not
bad
drinkability
a
nice
beer
in
the
style
barley
wine
an
explosion
of
deep
rich
flavor
biscuity
and
sweet
malts
alcohol
on
the
finish
slight
bitterness
on
the
aftertaste
full
weight
on
the
tongue
good
as
a
winter
warmer
for
a
cold
winter
night
as
it
is
id
consider
it
a
middle
of
the
road
bw
but
ill
probably
pick
up
one
more
to
lay
down
for
a
year
or
two
and
see
how
it
matures
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
that
was
simply
begging
for
some
small
refinements
o
nice
one
it
gets
somewhat
harsh
in
places
then
again
so
do
most
barleywines
rather
its
a
bit
harsher
than
some
of
the
really
great
examples
out
there
still
i
cant
think
of
a
better
aging
candidate
m
pretty
decently
carbonated
quite
carbonated
but
not
too
much
so
not
smooth
but
kind
of
if
that
makes
sense
nicely
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
very
little
carbonation
overall
not
the
best
and
not
the
worst
the
taste
is
certainly
different
from
most
barleywines
and
was
what
the
brewer
was
probably
going
for
not
bad
the
scent
kinda
throws
me
offdoesnt
really
resemble
a
barleywine
the
taste
is
an
improvement
but
is
kinda
bland
and
boozy
its
decent
for
a
winter
warmertype
beer
though
it
will
be
nice
to
be
able
to
pull
these
out
of
the
cellar
for
the
next
few
winters
at
least
this
beer
deserves
respect
and
demands
to
be
sipped
this
is
liquid
warmth
on
a
wintry
night
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
is
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
its
actually
very
easy
drinking
for
the
abv
and
has
some
interesting
flavor
combinations
but
it
just
isnt
as
good
as
a
really
good
big
barleywine
o
not
overly
complex
but
features
nice
highlights
that
run
true
to
the
style
overall
disappointed
with
this
one
no
doubt
besides
peche
i
havent
had
another
brew
from
dieu
du
ciel
that
is
really
worth
continually
buying
overall
this
beer
wasnt
terribly
complex
the
highlight
for
me
being
the
nose
i
would
like
perhaps
a
little
more
balance
and
a
cleaner
aftertaste
interested
to
know
how
age
will
effect
the
progression
of
this
beer
given
the
twist
off
bottle
cap
oxygen
will
do
its
work
faster
and
a
year
might
be
enough
time
to
turn
this
into
something
completely
different
nothing
remarkable
about
this
brew
very
simple
without
a
lot
going
on
decent
enough
but
wouldnt
feel
the
need
to
put
this
in
my
glass
again
o
4
0
its
alright
not
the
best
not
the
worst
little
too
boozy
for
10
2
percent
reminds
more
of
the
belgian
strong
darks
than
an
american
barleywine
this
was
a
pleasant
experience
one
of
the
first
beers
i
threw
into
my
cellar
so
this
is
one
is
from
2011
i
do
suggest
aging
one
for
yourself
overall
above
average
to
good
almost
solid
its
progression
and
mouthfeel
justify
the
price
for
me
for
the
most
part
worth
a
try
if
you
dont
like
it
you
might
want
to
try
aging
it
i
think
it
will
benefit
i
might
try
this
as
well

brown

some
pine
and
some
type
of
berry
from
the
hops
taste
starts
with
lots
of
dark
fruit
and
molasses
the
middle
brings
a
note
of
nuttiness
more
molasses
and
carmel
start
to
get
pine
from
the
hops
too
the
finish
gets
much
hoppier
as
i
get
notes
of
pine
and
grass
however
the
malt
bill
stays
strong
and
really
goes
well
with
the
hops
lots
of
molasses
dark
fruit
such
as
raisins
and
figs
carmel
a
hint
of
cocoa
and
grapes
just
a
tiny
hint
of
alcohol
on
the
finish

it
goes
well
with
the
other
flavors
it
does
bring
a
nice
warming
sensation

i
get
to

again

the
beer
flavor
is
harsh
bitterness
all

bitingly
bitter
big
and
bad
with
warming
alcohol
its
a
rough
sultry
barleywine
meant
for
the
cooler
months
dont
ask
me
why
i
chose
to
crack
the
bottle
in
the
warm
rainy
spring
weather
that
we
are
having
today
big
fruit
ride
the
wave
of
harsh
bitterness

soaked

this
is
a
big
beer
all
day
with
lingering
waves
of
earthy
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
warming
alcohol
effect
taking
over
in
the
first
few
sips
if
this
is
their
winter
beer
its
meant
to
be
this
way
for
a
reason
to
keep
you
warm
when
you
are
walking
from
pub
to
pub
in
the
dead
of
winter
up
in
the
quebec
province
of
canada
overall
very
pleased
its
like
an
exotic
version
of
bigfoot
and
im
sure
its
appreciated
and
held
on
to
every
year
during
its
release
to
experience
something
like
this
so
big
yet
so
quaffable
o
aroma
popped
from
the
glass
very
well
and
the
flavor
was
bursting
but
the
red
fruit
flavors
were
a
little
over
the
top
not
what
i
would
consider
to
be
a
traditional
american
barleywine
as
the
hops
were
overshadowed
by
the
big
malt
emphasis
again
this
beer
was
complex
and
shined
in
many
aspects
this
was
my
first
craft
beer
from
canada
what
an
introduction
ive
taken
a
liking
to
this
style
of
beer
and
this
one
is
no
exception
its
a
dark
red
pour
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
the
taste
is
worth
savoring
there
are
flavors
of
toffee
caramel
and
a
touch
of
roasted
bitterness
certainly
an
exemplar
of
barleywines
and
something
worth
trying
and
seeking
out
a
nice
beer
for
sure
the
alcohol
provides
a
warming
effect
and
makes
this
one
a
sure
sipper
very
well
balanced
chewy
hot
at
times
but
still
a
very
nice
beer
alcohol
is
certainly
noticeable
which
provides
about
the
only
drawback
nowhere
near
an
american
barleywine
but
spot
on
for
english
version
verdict
a
harsh
barleywine
from
ddc
and
another
example
of
why
im
not
a
fan
of
american
style
barleywines
just
too
bitter
and
abrasive
the
grain
and
fruit
really
get
overshadowed
by
the
hops
and
alcohol
hardly
enjoyable
o
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
does
this
need
to
age
more
excellent
i
had
to
play
with
the
overall
score
to
get
the
letter
grade
that
was
appropriate
this
keeps
my
reviews
fair
and
consistent
please
see
my
profile
for
more
information
o
this
is
fairly
boozy
time
in
the
cellar
will
iron
that
out
but
even
then
theres
nothing
that
really
makes
this
beer
stand
out
from
the
pack
the
price
point
wont
help
it
either
i
can
see
this
being
a
perennial
slow
seller
o
very
nice
beer
well
rounded
and
complex
o
dont
have
a
huge
experience
with
barley
wines
but
this
one
is
quite
nice
hits
a
sweet
spot
about
not
being
too
sweet
with
a
nice
balance
between
the
fruits
and
hops
and
keeps
it
warm
without
being
over
powering
as
i
said
not
an
expert
but
no
complaints
and
worth
trying
for
sure
good
after
dinner
beer
during
the
cold
months
and
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
it
tastes
with
age
also
if
youre
getting
this
beer
in
florida
you
shouldnt
complaint
too
much
about
the
cost
as
its
reasonably
priced
where
its
brewed
3bottle
overy
nice
complex
and
well
rounded
my
first
barley
wine
so
i
dont
have
a
great
frame
of
reference
but
this
is
great
on
a
cool
winters
eve
and
seems
to
fit
the
style
description
will
throw
a
couple
in
the
cellar
for
next
year
o
overall
good
but
not
great
it
did
the
trick
on
this
relatively
cold
feb
night
overpriced
at
almost
6
a
bottle
which
seems
to
be
the
mo
for
this
brewery
worth
a
try
but
i
dont
think
id
purchase
this
again
unless
there
was
a
significant
decrease
in
price
pours
dark
brown
with
crimson
hues
and
a
light
tan

that
dies
quickly
aroma
is
brilliant
with
subtle
notes
of
milk
chocolate
spice
dark
fruits
vinegar
and
red
licorice
tastes
sweet
and
oaky
with
a
hint
of
cherry

complex
yet
smooth
all
the
way
with
a
light
to

body
and

with
this
beer
dieu

has
become
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
between
peche
mortel
derniere
volonte
corne
du
diable
route
des
epices
and
this
ive
witnessed
only
excellence
overall
a
fantastic
barleywine
right
now
but
with
some
age
will
probably
be
pretty
amazing
makes
me
anxious
to
try
the
vertical
that
was
so
generously
provided
by
montrealbcr89
there
was
almost
no
head
when
i
poured
this
into
my
snifter
the
appearance
was
auburn
the
suds
cling
to
the
sides
of
a
glass
for
a
really
long
time
after
a
sip
it
smells
boozy
almost
like
a
nice
bourbon
the
taste
follows
the
nose
except
that
it
tastes
a
bit
like
caramel
andor
toffee
too
this
barleywine
is
sticky
like
a
good
one
should
be
im
happy
i
tried
it
it
went
down
well
during
the
blizzard
of
2013
i
was
expecting
the
taste
to
change
a
bit
as
it
warmed
up
though
i
dont
know
if
id
drink
this
one
again
maybe
when
next
years
snowstorm
hits
the
east
coast
tres
bien
cheers
poured
a
brownish
body
with
minimal
head
and
a
hearty
aroma
of
malts
with
a
mix
of
roasted
and
caramel
malt
along
with
minor
grape
hops
andor
dark
fruit
i
think
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
coming
through
the
beer
is
strong
not
too
strong
though
alcohol
has
a
minor
role
but
doesnt
bleed
and
is
a
good
sipper
figs
caramel
toffee
or
bitter
chocolate
seem
to
make
a
cameo
and
the
breadinessroastiness
of
the
malts
makes
it
sturdy
and
there
is
a
good
balance
of
dark
fruit
sweetness
and
hops
finishes
a
little
boozy
but
not
an
abv
burn
o
i
enjoyed
the
balance
of
this
beer
color
is
nice
but
smell
wasnt
much
but
i
probably
served
a
bit
too
cold
but
a
good
tasty
drinkable
not
too
sweet
yet
bitter
barley
wine
another
great
beer
from
our
friends
in
canada
overall
it
is
a
very
good
barley
wine
very
balanced
smooth
and
tasty
overall
i
like
this
barleywine
a
lot
has
all
the
trademark
flavor
strong
but
not
overly
so
this
drinks
easy
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
any
beer
fan
overall
this
is
a
decent
representation
of
an
american
barleywine
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
a
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
barleywine
rich
and
pleasantly
multilayered
ill
most
likely
be
picking
up
another
bottle
or
two
for
the
cellar
overall
this
is
a
solid
barleywine
its
nice
drinking
it
while
the
snow
storm
of
the
century
that
closed
down
work
for
me
today
is
going

american
styles
and
is
brewed
by
a
canadian

o
weird
beer
sure
but
its
strangely
delicious
sometimes
odd
combinations
of
flavors
work
this
is
one
of
those
times
overall
not
bad
plenty
of
flavor
a

and
a
real

i
enjoy
the
woodsmoked
flavor
this
has
would
like
to
age
for
a
year
to
see
the
alcohol
die
down
and
let
some
more
malts
come
out
would
be
a
great
barrel
aged
beer
worth
a
drink
but
way
way
overpriced
overall
im
only
guessing
here
but
from
reading
other
reviews
this
beer
has
lost
a
lot
of
flavor
in
exchange
for
that
the
10
alcohol
is
just
nonexistent
nice
version
of
the
style
this
was
a
dusty
bottle
so
the
age
on
this
took
off
any
edges
that
may
have
existed
at
bottling
o
my
first
barley
wine
found
it
pretty
good
that
abv
is
well
hidden
this
beer
pours
a
medium
bodied
hazelnut
brown
in
color
with
amber
highlights
and
a
slight
off
white
lacing
around
the
glass
the
nose
is
both
rich
and
sweet
it
features
a
bouquet
of
molasses
sorghum
slight
cherry
and
a
touch
of
oak
nice
nose
for
a
barleywine
and
smooth
the
flavors
too
full
and
sweet
it
features
candied
sugar
molasses
brown
sugar
light
oak
a
light
bitterness
with
a
touch
of
cream
in
the
finish
well
rounded
flavor
as
well
for
being
10
2
there
isnt
any
alcohol
at
all
it
drinks
pretty
full
in
body
with
plenty
of
residual
sugar
it
is
big
but
isnt
overpowering
in
one
facet
or
another
its
just
a
well
rounded
barleywine
i
recommend
it
its
barleywine
season
and
this
was
a
nice
way
to
start
it
off
if
only
dieu
du

would
barrel
aged
this
this
is
a
decent

barley

tons
of

complexity
going

just
a
bit

much

even
for
the
immense

for
a
12

o
tasty
barleywine
that
id
happily
have
again
im
finding
plenty

another
offering
from
them
that
i
liked
alot
overall
really
nice
stuff
the
nose
could
be
a
little
bigger
but
otherwise
this
is
a
quality
american
barleywine
this
one
is
definitely
worth
checking
out
so
if
you
happen
to
see
it
somewhere
give
it
a
shot
recommended
pours
a
rich
reddish
brown
and
quite
clear
with
next
to
no
head
and
thus
no
lacing
aroma
is
quite
nice
with
raisins
dried
fruit
peppery
spice
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
underneath
it
all
the
beer
itself
has
a
solid
body
with
a
slight
syrupy
nature
to
it
with
spiciness
some
complexity
in
the
malts
mainly
being
levels
of
dried
fruit
and
caramel
notes
seemingly
from
crystal
malts
the
bitterness
is
surprisingly
noticeable
in
the
beer
for
such
a
sweetness
but
it
keeps
the
palate
cleaner
than
i
had
expected
a
well
put
together
barley
wine
that
is
really
worth
having
again

overall
this
is
a
very
nice
barleywine
nice

balance
and
complexity
and
extremely
smooth
to
sip
on
a
very
enjoyable
offering
note
not
sure
what
i
was
smoking
today
but
i
actually
snapped
the
top
of
the
bottle
of
when
opening
with
my
stainless
spaten
bottle
opener
maybe
it
was
the
funky
canadian
bottle
sizes
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
barleywine
and
one
i
would
gladly
reach
for
again
and
again
the
fine
balance
and
delicious
flavors
in
here
mark
a
brew
crafted
by
true
experts
and
lovers
of
the
style
and
even
the
heavy
alcohol
burn
is
a
perfect
complement
to
the
dark
sugars
and
ashy
notes
i
certainly
know
what
ill
be
drinking
when
the
snow
comes
overall
try
this
for
yourself
and
you
be
the
judge
i
bought
this
literally
on
a
whim
i
give
everything
a
shot
and
i
never
head
a
review
before
making
my
own
this
beer
was
money
well
spent
salud
final
thoughts
its
hard
for
me
to
really
judge
this
beer
having
only
had
one
other
barelywine
before
still
i
didnt
find
it
all
that
enjoyable
so
i
think
its
more
of
a
fault
with
the
style
then
the
beer
i
would
pass
on
this
in
the
future
though
o
this
beer
is
a
palate
destroyer
its
intense
flavors
and
strong
alcohol
have
more
in
common
with
scotch
or
rum
than
beer
it
does
however
mellow
as
it
warms
solstice
is
a
sound
sipper
o
a
good
if
not
great
beer
its
harsh
but
lots
of
young
barleywines
are
theres
definitely
tons
of
potential
of
this
beer
being
rich
and
decadent
in
about
5
years
tasty
mfull
body
with
a
nice
carb
level
love
this
brewery
o
a
complex
enjoyable
beer
definitely
one
to
sip
slowly
overall
that
vanilla
kick
really
makes
the
beer
tick
transcends
the
third
coast
old
ale
i
had
yesterday
because
of
it
but
the
hops
are
more
pungent
in
this
one
enjoyable
if
not
a
little
unbalanced
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
12
inch
khaki
head
that
fades
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
randomly
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
fruit
carameltoffee
brown
sugar
malt
and
alcohol
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
burnt
caramel
brown
sugar
and
some
fruity
flavors
there
is
also
some
herbal
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
a
full
bodied
and
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
barleywine
but
i
am
enjoying
the
smell
on
this
one
more
than
the
taste
drinkability
its
a
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
bottle
was
marked
10
whatever
that
means
definitely
a
sipper
medium
body
with
little
carbonation
best
to
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
before
drinking
the
flavors
come
out
better
and
more
balanced
warms
you
as
you
drink
it
perfect
for
winter
a
great
barleywine
typical
of
the
style
and
one
to
search
out
and
try
aroma
of
caramel
and
molasse
light
hops
dark
brown
color
darker
than
usual
for
a
barley
wine
thin

mediumheavy
sweet
full
bodied
soft
carbonation
long
finish
im
a
fan
of
dieu
du
ciel
since
the
beginning
as
usual
for
this
brewery
this
beer
is
a
little
different
of
the
usual
style
caracteristics
i
like
the
little
spicy
and
sweetness
taste
this
was
an
interesting
experience
i
like
this
barley
wine
just
like
i
enjoy
most
barley
wines
i
am
happy
to
have
picked
up
this
bottle
o
a
bold
tasty
barley
wine
more
hops
than
i
would
have
expected
overall
quite
good
perhaps
better
with
some
more
time
on
it
as
it
is
a
bit
hot
really
nice
smell
this
is
an
ass
kicker
of
a
pintglasso
beer
and
i
have
never
used
the
phrase
before
but
this
is
not
for
the
timid
youre
gonna
know
you
drank
it
o
you
can
watch
the
clouds
roll
by
with
this
one
in
your
grasp
the
sum
of
its
parts
elevates
it
to
something
special
o
very
tasty
barley
wine
id
have
another
recommended
o
highly
recommended
this
meets
the
incredibly
high
standards
ive
set
for
dieu
due
ciel
utterly
recommended
will
seek
out
to
have
again
remarkably
good
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
overall
a
good
barleywine
by
brasserie
dieu
du
ciel
there
are
some
lovely
dark
fruit
flavours
i
really
enjoyed
the
hint
of
molasses
flavour
came
up
as
a
surprise
worthy
of
trying
o
sip
slowly
alcohol
is
strong
on
this
one
looking
forward
to
trying
others
from
this
brewery
nice
to
know
canada
brews
more
than
molson
labbats
o
this
is
my
first
barley
wine
and
i
was
not
disappointed
simply
fantastic
i
look
forward
to
cellaring
a
couple
of
bottles
and
comparing
again
in
a
year
or
two
if
i
can
be
disciplined
for
that
long
o
ive
got
a
giant
soft
spot
for
quebec
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
i
think
this
bottle
is
fairly
fresh
so
id
love
to
try
an
older
one
soon
to
compare
its
a
really
good
barleywine
and
it
shows
the
quebec
sense
of
balance
perfectly
an
excellent
barley
wine
that
was
a
real
flavorful
sipper
a
boozy
one
that
needs
some
time
but
the
alcohol
isnt
overthetop
enough
to
stop
it
from
being
drunk
young
i
wish
i
could
give
the
nose
a
6
but
i
also
sort
of
wish
that
the
palate
had
more
of
the
noses
fruitiness
o
overall
i
thought
it
was
good
better
than
the
average
barleywine
but
not
the
best
its
a
sweeter
maltier
barleywine
so
that
is
something
to
consider
when
deciding
to
drink
this
i
would
drink
it
again
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
people
who
prefer
nonsuperhopped
barleywines
a
delightful
little
barleywine
right
here
nice
drinkability
for
the
style
the
heavy
price
tag
will
probably
stop
me
from
picking
this
one
up
again
however
overall
this
is
an
excellent
barley
wine
complex
yet
subtle
i
think
it
could
benefit
from
a
few
months
to
a
year
in
the
cellar
but
certainly
not
much
more
because
the
hop
complexity
isnt
there
overall
im
glad
i
bought
16
of
these
because
i
look
forward
to
drinking
more
o
what
a
delightful
beer
a
very
warming
drink
for
the
winter
holidays
wellcrafted
and
interesting
it
is
a
haunting
beer
that
comes
to
mind
quickly
when
i
want
to
drink
a
really
good
beer
d
a
robust
sugary
barleywine
that
doesnt
pull
any
punches
when
it
comes
to
the
alcoholic
bite
murky
ruby
brown
colour
eing
of
white
head
not
much
retention
and
no
lace
smell
is
quite
malty
sweet
dark
sugar
scents
cherry
dark
bread
still
a
decent
hop
profile
left
and
light
alcohol
notes
taste
follows
the
nose
lots
of
malt
and
lightly
sweet
cherry
fairly
bitter
with
a
good
amount
of
hop
bite
citrus
and
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
caramel
and
toffee
as
well
as
some
earthy
points
lightmed
carbonation
syrupy
and
quite
sticky
full
body
medfull
weight
solid
barleywine
not
too
sweet
or
too
hoppy
and
quite
balanced
not
a
standout
favorite
but
still
very
good
strong
aroma
is
rather
sweet
with
clove
apple
caramel
and
honey
notes
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
mahogany
with
a
rather
typical
light
tan
head
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
lipsmacking
flavor
has
caramel
apple
clove
and
malt
notes
as
well
as
an
undertone
of
hoppy
bitterness
that
offsets
the
honey
sweetness
smooth
texture
has
average
body
and
just
a
little
fizz
but
it
persists
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
overall
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
just
didnt
totally
come
together
for
me
i
have
no
doubt
this
brew
could
have
sat
for
another
year
or
so
as
the
alcohol
character
is
not
hiding
at
all
however
i
dont
see
the
musty
quality
of
the
grain
going
away
which
i
didnt
find
particular
enjoyable
either
overall
ok
probably
a
little
too
young
i
remembered
the
laste
versions
to
be
better
this
brewery
has
some
major
hits
peche
mortel
of
course
and
aphrodite
but
this
i
put
in
the
category
with
their
attempt
at
an
ipa
corne
du
diable
a
miss
dark
cola
brown
in
appearance
with
a
film
layer
of
cream
head
on
top
throughout
the
sitting
a
moderate
to
heavy
dose
of
spicy
floral
hops
greet
the
nose
along
with
sweet
caramel
malts
vanilla
spice
and
a
warm
oak
like
presence
slightly
boozy
smells
amazing
taste
gets
the
same
score
with
a
bitter
caramel
dark
chocolate
lead
off
that
turns
toffee
slight
brown
sugar
and
highly
hopped
throughout
solid
fairly
complex
american
barleywine
damn
this
is
good
stuff
couldnt
ask
for
a
more
spot
on
body
here
with
a
slight
warming
out
back
but
oh
so
drinkable
o
just
excellent
the
only
downfall
i
can
find
is
the
bitterness
just
slightly
too
present
but
this
beer
is
a
great
experience
you
will
never
regret
i
would
drink
it
all
night
long
t
some
smooth
roasted
malt
and
burnt
caramel
upfront
followed
by
some
notes
of
dark
fruit
wood
and
a
bit
of
rye
bread
finish
has
some
lingering
hop
bitterness
a
really
solid
barleywine
o
enjoyable
and
worth
your
while
this
isnt
a
boozy
barley
wine
which
i
really
appreciate
while
sweet
its
also
balanced
its
not
aggressive
and
unlike
many
barley
wines
enjoyed
the
full
8oz
pour
would
certainly
check
this
one
out
again
o
its
a
descent
barleywine
but
nothing
extraordinary
overall
a
good
beer
that
needs
a
bit
more
time
in
the
cellar
to
show
its
true
potential
md
smooth
at
first
kind
of
a
sharp
finish
but
not
off
putting
a
fine
barleywine
held
up
great
after
a
year
in
the
cellar
o
good
flavor
body
and
aroma
a
good
example
of
a
barley
wine
tastes
more
english
style
than
west
coast
poured
this
noble
winter
beer
in
a
snifter
glass
pours
brown
in
color
with
flaming
red
highlights
its
taste
is
delicately
sweet
and
liquorlike
with
a
hint
of
burnt
caramel
coming
from
the
malt
and
a
prolonged
boiling
time
it
is
a
very
bitter
beer
with
aromas
of
hops
and
alcohol
and
flavors
reminiscent
of
red
fruit
brought
by
the
englishtype
yeast
the
brewery
uses
to
ferment
it
the
aftertaste
is
accentuated
by
the
wonderful
flavor
of
hops
solstice
dhiver
is
brewed
only
once
a
year
and
is
then
aged
for
4
to
5
months
before
being
sold
this
aging
process
is
necessary
to
achieve
an
ideal
equilibrium
between
the
sharp
bitterness
and
the
other
flavors
in
the
beer
after
aging
it
is
then
sold
starting
middecember
of
each
year
a
very
nice
barleywine
d
pretty
good
it
was
6
over
here
which
isnt
too
unreasonable
for
a
fantastic
barleywine
but
this
is
a
goodtogreat
one
i
would
pick
this
up
again
found
bottle
at
groppis
it
is
a
strong
old
barley
wine
i
did
not
know
what
the
style
was
it
had
an
unexpected
level
of
boldness
not
very
smooth
because
of
the
high
alcohol
it
was
good
i
would
try
another
type
from
this
french
canadian
brewery
lools
solid
seems
particular
dark
almost
porter
ish
no
head
at
all
very
slim
lacing
that
clings
to
outer
rim
does
not
follow
down
the
glass
very
faint
in
the
nose
small
hints
of
sweetness
not
much
else
taste
is
solid
slight
malt
sweetness
very
little
hop
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
not
spectacular
flavors
still
resonate
longer
than
it
should
overall
solid
beer
not
outstanding
just
solid
o
not
bad
would
prefer
this
to
be
just
a
tad
sweeter
still
like
it
a
lot
huge
fan
of
dieu
du
ceil
would
love
to
take
a
trip
to
montreal
and
have
some
of
their
brews
on
tap
pours
into
my
snifter
a
brownish
honey
color
some
orange
on
the
edges
very
little
head
and
apparent
carbonation
smells
of
sweet
sugars
and
caramel
bit
of
alcohol
taste
brings
forth
some
hop
bitterness
at
the
front
continues
with
those
caramel
notes
fairly
balanced
hop
and
malt
flavors
but
its
leaving
me
with
desire
for
more
complexity
i
can
taste
the
10
2
but
it
isnt
overwhelming
medium
bodied
with
pretty
good
carbonation
that
wasnt
as
noticeable
on
the
pour
overall
a
decent
american
barleywine
but
the
depth
and
balance
just
isnt
quite
there
for
me
upon
first
pour
you
notice
a
wonderful
aroma
of
barley
and
sugar
the
beer
pours
a
honey
cream
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
and
minimal
carbonation
the
high
abv
is
countered
by
a
sugary
sweet
note
of
citrus
fruit
followed
by
a
nice
aftertaste
that
leaves
a
warm
tinge
on
the
tongue
a
very
good
brew
indeed
oi
found
this
to
be
an
extremely
enjoyable
barleywine
and
im
anxious
to
figure
out
the
actual
vintage
on
this
one
o
the
beer
is
underwhelming
the
flavors
dont
seem
to
blend
very
well
not
my
coup
of
tee
overall
a
good
effort
nice
flavors
not
expensive
but
also
not
cheap
ill
revisit
this
one
and
i
am
definitely
interested
in
this
breweries
other
ales
the
beer
poured
a
dark
hazy
amber
color
and
formed
a
light
brown
foam
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
and
sediment
was
present
an
aroma
of
malt
caramel
chocolate
anise
and
pepper
the
flavor
was
of
malt
candy
caramel
and
spices
the
body
was
medium
light
and
the
finish
bittersweet
o
phew
this
one
will
take
your
headoff
an
awesome
brew
but
one
to
let
sit
and
rest
for
a
few
years
o
taste
does
not
hold
up
to
aroma
its
a
good
beer
but
just
missing
something
for
me
in
the
taste
o
an
excellent
example
of
an
americanstyle
barleywine
i
usually
prefer
englishstyle
but
the
hops
was
nicely
integrated
and
played
second
fiddle
to
the
malt
this
one
wont
blow
you
away
but
its
very
tasty
overall
a
dark
wooded
sipper
if
there
ever
was
one
dont
mind
it

but
theres
a
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
molasses
brown
sugar
yeast
bready
malt
and
caramel
it
tastes
like
caramel
malt
toffee
brown
sugar
bready
malt
and
some
plums
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
somewhat
coating
and
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
i
think
its
a
decent
beer
overall
but
theres
nothing
really
impressive
about
this
maybe
it
would
be
better
if
i
had
aged
it
longer
so
i
might
buy
another
bottle
to
do
just
that
all
in
all
a
rather
solid
barleywine
would
i
seek
it
out
again
probably
not
unless
i
was
going
to
lay
it
down
for
a
good
35
years
as
i
think
this
will
age
nicely
and
that
bitterness
will
smooth
out
into
a
real
gem
recommended
a
bit
disappointing
considering
my
previous
experiences
with
dieu
du
ciel
not
a
bad
barleywine
but
nothing
to
really
write
home
about
on
the
palate
quite
seamless
the
malt
alcohol
and
sugars
align
nicely
to
provide
balance
notes
of
toffee
malt
and
hops
align
with
a
great
acidity
and
mouth
feel
a
nice
balance
of
not
being
too
boozy
andor
malt
forward
like
some
overproduced
barley
wines
can
be
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
red
color
almost
brown
the
head
was
thin
and
really
didnt
go
anywhere
with
the
lacing
in
my
opinion
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
boozy
sweetness
to
it
the
taste
of
caramel
upfront
that
fades
into
a
warming
tingle
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
thick
a
little
oily
and
smooth
overall
the
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
back
end
kind
of
on
the
strong
side
since
its
a
winter
brew
and
a
barley
wine
it
kind
of
makes
sense
i
guess
i
just
prefer
a
more
hoppy
barley
wine
but
this
one
wasnt
too
bad
mouthfeel
very
nice
with
a
minor
alcohol
sting
at
the
end
carbonation
is
light
to
medium
body
is
medium
to
full
overall
a
delicious
beer
from
the
best
microbrew
in
canada
o
overall
a
decent
barleywine
hops
seem
to
only
be
in
the
finish
kind
of
boozy
medium
thickness
in
the
mouthfeel
sippable
brew
that
would
be
a
good
strong
winter
warmer
enjoyable
d
nice
barleywine
but
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
the
complex
smell
overall
a
pleasing
offer
from
dieu
du
ciel
that
ill
likely
be
revisiting
in
the
future
o
good
overall
but
the
flavor
is
a
stark
surprising
contrast
from
the
aroma
this
barleywine
has
held
up
very
well
for
its
age
though
id
love
to
give
a
fresh
bottle
a
go
an
alright
bw
if
your
into
bws
get
it
for
the
knowledge
and
experience
of
the
tick
otherwise
dont
worry
about
it
much
from
bottle
to
a
snifter
redbrown
color
minimal
head
but
carbonated
enough
to
be
lively
in
the
glass
i
have
had
severe
allergies
for
years
and
my
sense
of
smell
is
almost
gonetaste
is
also
affected
so
i
cant
discern
many
of
the
subtleties
that
others
can
and
i
apologise
for
that
however
i
can
attest
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
true
malt
bomb
that
has
absolutely
no
cloying
sweetness
alcohol
content
is
not
apparent
but
two
of
these
and
driving
would
be
a
bad
idea
as
a
note
of
comparison
the
absolutely
best
beer
of
this
type
that
i
have
ever
had
was
the
original
thomas
hardys
ale
and
this
is
the
most
worthy
successor
i
have
found
very
similar
but
more
dry
a
good
thing
o
i
am
really
stoked
on
this
slightly
smoky
maltbomb
thanks

aroma
with

picking
up
quite
a
bit
of

on
the

enough
that
it
distracts
from
the

tastes
of
rich
sweet

plump

and
cloves
finishes
with
a
lingering
leafy
bitterness
and
some
noticeable
alcohol
but
not
as
much
booze
as
the
aroma
would
suggest
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
a
soft
smooth
mouthfeel
leaves
a
slick
oily
sensation
on
the
palate
between
mouthfuls
very
tasty
really
really
smooth
so
much
that
it
doesnt
even
feel
as
though
its
hitting
the
sides
its
a
weird
experience
but
i
like
my
beers
to
be
more
complex
and
more
challenging
this
is

pours
a

with
a
very
low

aroma
of
sherry

slight

of
hops
and
lightly
phenolic
flavors
are
rich
sweet
honey
biscuit

prunes
creamy

moderately

and
a

to
speak
slight
reddish
brown

to
an
otherwise
almost
entirely
dark
brown
beer
partially
translucent
left
light
through
nicely
unexpected
amount
of
sediment
poured
from
the
bottle
so
i
let
it
rest
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
and
sticky
a
bit
of
spicy
some
cloves
but
balanced
with
some
lactosevanilla
undertones
taste
was
sweet
slightly
fruity
but
had
banana
type
tones
to
keep
from
getting
too
sweet
felt
good
in
the
mouth
coated
nicely
and
not
overly
carbonated
a
tad
of
bitterness
on
the
toungue
detracted
slightly
overall
it
was
a
well
balanced
solid
beer
not
overly
sweet
like
some
barleywines
the
aroma
is
bourbonlike
rich
nad
nutty
with
notes
of
dates
and
honey
alcohol
is
noticeable
and
at
10
i
expected
it
to
be
lingering
finish
of
honey
and
alcohol
not
dissimilar
to
mead
a
bit
heavy
for
regular
consumption
but
perfect
for
cold
winter
day
it
is
tasty
but
i
think
i
will
cellar
the
remaining
3
bottle
for
a
few
months
to
a
few
years
and
see
how
the
falvours
develop
over
time
o
rich
as
tasty
with
the
barley
wine
flavours
i
have
grown
to
enjoy
although
the
alcohol
has
a
bit
of
a
nasal
clearing
quality
it
is
very
drinkable
after
a
draft
of
corne
du
diable
i
grabbed
a
bottle
of
this
over
at
churchkey
despite
the
markup
im
glad
i
did
great
from
the
pour
dark
and
murky
with
a
tiny
bit
of
head
sweet
malty
smell
with
a
bit
of
darker
fruit
and
some
alcoholsoaked
wood
on
drinking
almost
as
thick
as
it
looks
but
pretty
smooth
too
the
oak
element
comes
in
pretty
quick
but
so
does
the
bittersweet
raisiny
side
together
theyre
pretty
great
and
make
for
a
very
warming
savory
beer
the
carbonation
and
the
bitterness
really
save
this
one
from
being
too
syrupy
would
love
to
try
it
on
draft
mouthfeel
moves
from
full
and
thick
to
dry
and
clean
to
boozy
it
may
be
more
than
it
had
to
be
but
its
good
nonetheless
drinkability
is
ok
but
could
have
better
if
it
was
simplified
a
bit
as
it
currently
gets
a
tiny
bit
messy
in
the
middle
good
barleywine
though
drinks
easy
enough
makes
me
think
english
bw
nice
enough
this
was
over
50
cents
an
ounce
sooo
i
consider
this
a
one
done
mostly
on
the
cost
basis
abv
is
10
2
pours
a
dark
rubybrown
color
with
a
very
small
offwhite

scent
is
heavy
caramel
malt
with
some
booze
i
also
get
some
lovely
dark
fruits
taste
is
hoppier
than
nose
leads
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
hops
and
caramel
malt
i
also
get
some
burnt
malt
with
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
of
warming
booze
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
syrupy
but
wellcarbonated
at
the
same
time
drinkability
is
fairly
high
as
i
am
a
big
fan
of
barleywines
drink
i
liked
the
other
two
beers
i
have
had
from
ddc
this
was
good
but
doesnt
match
the
other
two
probably
wont
have
this
one
again
except
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
a
as
the
style
is
rather
hoppy
barley
wine
sampled
at
a
beer
tasting
at
de
klomp
linköping
sweden
d
fairly
drinkable
definitely
a
big
sipping
beer
but
there
is
a
lot
to
enjoy
here
the
booze
flavor
is
a
bit
strong
but
works
alongside
the
other
really
big
flavors
the
hop
mixed
in
is
really
excellent
d
compared
to
other
barelywines
seems
well
balanced
and
quite
enjoyable
i
like
this
beer
and
highly
recommend
picking
this
up
if
you
do
see
it
i
liked
this
a
big
barleywine
with
some
flavor
and
complexity
that
drank
well
for
its
size
this
was
only
a
half
pour
but
it
left
me
wanting
to
investigate
it
further
i
have
some
bottles
at
home
in
cellar
i
think
its
about
time
to
break
one
out
the
brewery
achieved
a
surpisingly
throrough
maturation
with
the
relatively
short
aging
of
the
beer
poured
a
deep
chestnut
bordering
on
cola
appropirately
sweet
malty
character
with
all
of
the
rough
edges
smoothed
out
no
boozyness
from
the
alcohol
predominant
flavor
was
brown
sugar
and
caramel
sweetness
was
a
bit
too
forefront
and
the
beer
seemed
to
reach
for
something
else
that
it
never
quite
found
good
but
not
great
bottle
poured
into
a
dfh
tulip
glass
a
clear
dark
mahagony
reddish
brown
color
with
a
fluffy
1
finger
head
that
is
fairly
slow
to
settle
the
aroma
is
actually
pretty
subdued
with
some
dark
fruit
notes
along
with
a
ever
so
slight
smokiness
to
be
honest
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
subdued
nose
as
i
think
t
takes
away
from
the
overall
experience
medium
mouthfeel
sweet
dark
fruit
start
gives
way
to
semibland
hop
and
alcohol
notes
nice
lace
left
on
the
glass
as
this
goes
down
in
the
spectrum
of
bws
i
think
this
one
is
on
the
muted
side
with
much
too
sedate
flavors
for
my
liking
overall
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
with
this
one
especially
considering
its
ddc
while
you
still
get
a
decent
barleywine
here
i
expected
more
and
have
had
better
as
i
mentioned
this
beer
needs
to
be
aged
its
incredibly
strong
and
difficult
at
this
point
wow
after
reading
the
product
description
in
french
on
the
side
label
looks
like
i
was
bang
on
alcohol
fruit
and
bitter
hops
cest
vrai
poured
a
very
reluctant
18
head
which
dissipated
to
a
trace
dark
burnt
umber
color
almost
no
smell
at
all
not
particularly
thick
bodied
for
a
barleywine
id
just
call
it
medium
classic
dark
beer
flavors
of
chocolate
malt
barley
caramel
and
coffee
good
but
i
agree
with
some
other
reviewers
its
a
little
harsh
so
not
great
had
with
3
years
on
it
its
lovely
too
bad
it
took
so
long
to
shine
im
not
a
big
barleywine
fan
the
style
is
probably
pretty
out
there
for
most
folks
but
as
barleywines
go
this
is
less
aggressive
than
many
ive
had
requires
the
big
comfy
chair
and
a
period
of
immobility
pours
a
nice
deep
caramel
color
not
the
most
head
or
retention
ever
but
some
smell
was
pretty
boozy
and
a
very
sweet
sweet
malt
though
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
overwhelming
i
actually
didnt
have
a
problem
with
that
for
some
reason
there
is
a
lot
of
alcohol
so
why
hide
it
taste
was
good
a
nice
mix
of
sweet
malt
caramel
dark
fruit
and
some
spice
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
but
nothing
offensive
or
anything
warming
sensation
as
it
goes
down
overall
a
great
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
this
style

nice

this
is
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
more
along
the
lines
of
the
english
style
than
the
more
hoppy
american
version
the

makes
the
beer
an
excellent

warmer
perfect
for

in

temperatures
another
really
good
offering
from
dieu
du
ciel
d
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
barley
wine
and
was
able
to
confirm
that
the
my
first
dabble
into
barley
wines
was
simply
an
unfortunate
one
im
looking
forward
to
experimenting
with
this
newly
discovered
style
highly
recommended
to
any
barley
wine
fan
and
another
solid
offering
from
ddc
pours
deep
brown
with
offwhite
head
nose
is
musty
dusty
woody
with
a
hint
of
grandpalike
cologne
very
figgy
on
taste
sour
cherries
and
a
little
chalky
incredibly
long
finish
and
easy
drinking
as
far
as
barleywines
go
flavors
much
more
rich
as
it
warms
to
room
temperature
in
sweden
this
is
marketed
as
a
xmas
beer
i
feel
thats
quite
unfair
this
is
a
much
better
product
than
any
xmaxbeer
my
only
regret
is
that
i
didnt
buy
a
whole
case
and
put
it
in
my
beercellar
deep
gorgeous
amber
with
a
luscious
foam
head
lots
of
carbonation
this
isnt
my
favourite
style
of
beer
as
i
find
barley
ales
a
bit
on
the
cloying
side
that
being
said
i
do
like
this
one
it
has
a
sweet
chocolate
and
cherry
taste
sort
of
like
a
vastly
superior
dr
pepper
its
high
in
alcohol
and
for
me
this
reduces
the
drinkability
factor
slightly
however
that
is
a
characteristic
of
this
style
d
good
barleywine
expect
no
less
from
ddc
more
pleasant
than
others
of
the
style
ive
tried
pours
an
amber
brown
colour
with
thin
white
head
not
too
much
lacing
smells
quite
boozy
some
hops
and
brown
sugar
with
caramel
malt
the
flavour
is
sweet
and
boozy
i
dont
remember
it
quite
tasting
like
this
when
i
had
it
on
tap
a
year
ago
i
thought
it
was
much
more
balanced
i
didnt
review
my
first
bottle
of
it
but
the
2nd
bottle
was
the
same
maybe
im
just
not
a
fan
of
this
but
way
too
much
booze
and
the
flavour
doesnt
quite
hold
up
enough
good
carbonation
level
poured
a
ruby
brown
in
color
with
yellow
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
that
had
a
thin
frothy
had
and
left
a
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
my
smelling
senses
are
not
that
great
at
the
moment
but
i
was
able
to
detect
some
caramel
slight
toasty
notes
some
booze
with
mild
hop
notes
the
taste
also
had
the
caramel
and
toasty
character
alongside
brown
sugar
sweet
malts
and
hoppy
accents
the
brew
was
medium
to
full
in
body
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
toasty
malty
hoppy
and
very
mild
bitter
finish
it
drank
decent
but
was
definitely
a
sipper
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
brew
again
drink
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
this
beer
packs
a
punch
it
is
a
definite
slow
sipper
and
a
terrific
winter
warmer
a
commendable
barley
wine
that
really
comes
in
more
drinkable
than
many
of
its
colleagues
that
said
i
would
expect
nothing
less
from
ddc
and
would
venture
to
suggest
that
this
is
something
that
i
am
more
glad
to
have
had
than
something
im
particularly
excited
to
have
again
taste
had
the
typical
bitternesssourness
also
some
fruit
alcohol
was
again
really
noticeable
strong
but
definitely
got
smoother
as
i
went
on
and
overall
was
a
good
barley
wine
being
my
first
american
barleywine
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
and
glad
i
picked
up
another
one
of
these
for
the
cellar
im
not
sure
if
this
is
a
sign
im
getting
more
into
barleywines
or
i
just
like
the
american
version
more
but
this
one
was
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
bold
in
flavour
at
the
same
time
this
is
a
style
that
ill
be
sure
to
seek
out
again
basing
my
opinion
on
the
beers
ive
had
rather
than
the
beers
ive
had
in
this
style
id
say
this
one
is
more
than
worthy
of
a
try
and
a
great
addition
to
the
cellar
i
am
glad
to
have
another
of
these
on
hand
for
the
eclipsesolstice
that
shall
come
very
late
tonight
well
done
from
brasserie
dieu
du
ciel
a
really
good
barleywine
that
may
not
be
in
the
upper
echelon
of
american
barleywines
but
nonetheless
is
good
delicious
and
more
than
worthy
from
this
excellent
canadian
brewery
solstice
dhiver
might
only
appeal
to
those
in
parts
of
the
world
subject
to
the
harsh
melancholies
of
cold
snowy
winters
for
which
in
any
case
it
seems
to
have
been
designed
all
the
same
it
makes
a
convincing
case
that
the
darkest
shortest
coldest
time
of
the
year
can
actually
be
the
brightest
longest
and
warmest
if
paired
with
the
right
food
family
and
friends
and
of
course
good
drink
maybe
winter
aint
so
bad
after
all
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
great
winter
seasonal
warming
and
robust
it
offers
tons
of
character
and
is
far
too
easy
to
drink
pours
a
cloudy
reddish
brown
with
very
little
head
the
nose
is
phenol
cherries
malted
barley
taste
is
pretty
smooth
a
strong
alcohol
presence
which
warms
in
the
finish
light
moughtfeel
a
sipper
one
bottle
per
session
overall
a
kind
of
bland
offering
but
good
to
try
put
two
more
bottles
in
the
cellar
to
perhaps
revist
and
rereview
pours
a
ruddy
chestnut
brown
with
ruby
highlights
with
a
small
beige
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
a
thin
ring
nose
has
a
lingering
booziness
that
hints
that
this
might
be
a
little
hot
and
could
use
some
time
in
the
cellar
nose
also
brings
subtle
hints
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
dark
fruit
taste
is
dominated
by
caramel
and
toffee
up
front
followed
by
dark
fruits
and
some
spice
sharp
and
snappy
bitter
finish
with
a
touch
of
warmth
fullbodied
with
average
carbonation
mouthfeel
seems
suitable
for
the
style
an
enjoyable
complex
winter
sipper
that
is
a
welcome
change
from
the
ris
i
tend
to
reach
for
a
little
too
often
with
time
this
could
be
a
classy
brew
but
for
the
time
being
its
too
strong
on
the
fusel
alcohol
not
digging
this
one
at
all
these
guys
usually
make
great
beers
but
this
one
kinda
stinks
i
definitely
wouldnt
buy
it
again
great
stuff
i
enjoyed
this
some
barleywines
get
too
sweet
after
awhile
or
have
notes
that
dont
compliment
each
other
but
i
liked
this
i
think
the
hops
work
to
good
effect
here
booze
hits
you
pretty
hard
more
of
a
sipper
than
anything
else
substitute
for
a
glass
of
whiskey
or
scotch
m
medium
body
chewy
lightly
carbonated
as
for
drinkability
definitely
a
sipper
though
the
alcohol
doesnt
really
jump
on
you
it
doesnt
feel
as
hardcore
as
other
beers
at
high
abv
that
ive
tried
perfect
to
sip
on
and
a
very
pleasant
surprise
d
a
sipper
for
sure
but
pretty
damn
drinkable
overall
drinkability
is
not
there
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
it
is
not
an
exceptional
example
of
a
barley
wine
balance
is
good
but
flavors
and
mouthfeel
are
off
d
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
thought
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
this
brew
pours
a
hazy
rust
with
an
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
flavor
is
a
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
toast
and
a
solid
but
manageable
hop
presence
while
drinking
booze
notes
are
prominent
at
times
finish
is
long
and
very
hoppy
balance
is
good
between
sweet
and
bitter
and
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
keeps
everything
from
being
heavy
i
liked
this
beer
but
at
approximately
6
a
bottle
its
not
something
im
going
to
revisit
often
dlove
this
brewery
generally
speaking
but
at
6
bucks
a
bottle
very
let
down
by
this
one
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
again
d
this
is
an
enjoyable
barleywine
but
does
not
stand
out
as
a
great
barleywine
the
store
i
got
it
at
did
have
it
on
sale
so
it
was
worth
the
money
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
more
if
it
had
the
added
complexity
of
a
hoppy
finish
for
near
10
definitely
one
to
enjoy
for
dessert
great
for
the
style
drinkability
complex
brew
and
not
a
bad
example
for
the
brew
type
bitterness
is
a
little
powerful
but
managable
very
decent
brew
it
is
delicious
full
of
dark
fruits
but
persistent
after
6
years
hops
linger
on
recounting
the
years
gone
by
there
are
stories
to
tell
here
and
it
is
a
good
night
to
pass
a
bottle
on
to
a
dear
new
friend
i
would
guess
that
a
fairly
characterful
yeast
was
used
to
brew
this
beer
at
least
english
in
derivation
as
there
seems
to
be
quite
a
bit
of
spice
and
fruit
character
to
this
beer
this
adds
a
nice
complexity
to
this
beer
but
it
is
a
bit
weird
that
this
beer
is
so
hoppy
at
the
same
time
a
bit
more
restraint
with
the
hops
would
pair
quite
a
bit
better
with
the
characterful
yeast
strain
still
i
am
definitely
enjoying
this
beer
and
it
is
a
good
way
to
end
the
night
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
because
it
is
tasty
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
recommended
overall
my
first
beer
from
brasserie
dieu
du
ciel
and
solstice
dhiver
was
a
good
one
i
really
liked
it
go
buy
this
one
if
you
can
find
it
prost
ah
after
one
of
these
wonderful
ales
i
could
have
gone
back
for
more
however
the
10
abv
made
that
hard
to
do
i
will
remember
this
barleywine
for
its
dark
malty
creamy
nature
it
is
well
worth
it
d
drinking
quite
well
just
fell
off
a
bit
for
sure
i
would
imagine
1
year
would
be
superb
for
this
beer
glad
i
got
this
as
an
extra
drinks
more
like
an
old
ale
at
2
years
but
that
certainly
isnt
a
complaint
drinkability
a
nice
barleywine
but
ive
had
a
few
better
notes
a
really
tasty
and
very
complex
barleywine
i
can
see
this
aging
really
well
love
it
in
terms
of
taste
this
is
a
really
well
balanced
bw
big
malts
up
front
hop
in
the
middle
finishes
up
with
a
really
pleasant
dry
coffee
taste
as
the
beer
warms
the
tastes
dont
change
but
intensify
d
subtle
but
complex
this
is
something
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
in
a
sitting
bottle
pours
a
dark
slightly
clear
brown
with
a
decent
amount
of
foam
that
disappears
quickly
the
taste
is
of
sweet
dark
bitter
fruits
but
the
alcohol
is
a
little
hot
in
this
one
doesnt
take
away
from
the
beer
but
its
noticable
not
a
bad
beverage
by
any
means
d
the
alcohol
presence
drives
drinkability
down
a
little
bit
however
well
brewed
and
interesting
i
would
like
another
one
of
these
because
im
savoring
every
sip
brasserie
dieu
du
ciel
solstice
dhiver
is
a
good
north
american
barleywine
that
doesnt
quite
come
together
well
enough
to
be
considered
a
great
north
american
barleywine
its
still
an
easy
recommendation
since
a
12
ounce
single
shouldnt
break
the
bank
mouth
thick
complex
bitter
warm
nuts
caramel
biscuits
super
hoppy
finish
very
long
lasting
earthy
mouthfeel
is
creamy
fully
coating
all
taste
buds
are
touched
excited
niiice
drinkability
excellent
its
a
difficult
thing
to
make
a
hopheavy
barleywine
that
still
retains
all
of
the
malty
nuances
that
define
the
style
while
there
was
certainly
some
bitterness
toward
the
finish
the
hop
profile
was
more
vegetal
and
spicy
which
really
helped
to
moderate
all
of
the
malty
sweetness
instead
of
just
cover
them
up
with
pine
resin
loved
it
the
beer
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
caramel
malts
the
alcohol
is
also
very
present
in
the
aroma
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
beer
is
nearly
10
percent
abv
the
flavor
is
a
great
mix
of
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
once
again
the
alcohol
is
present
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
m
again
it
started
out
great
but
went
downhill
after
that
i
only
had
a
single
bottle
so
its
neither
here
nor
there
its
a
good
wellcrafted
barleywine
its
heavy
and
the
mouthfeel
is
semicloying
and
very
alcoholic
this
is
a
fullflavored
brew
that
i
would
have
with
cheese
d
boozy
with
a
big
warming
best
suited
and
served
for
the
colder
winter
months
at
9
8
it
seemed
to
drink
a
bit
bigger
then
advertised
overall
this
a
very
tasty
offering
from
dieu
du
ciel
i
have
yet
to
come
across
a
beer
from
this
brewery
that
i
havent
liked
good
flavor
and
well
balanced
this
is
another
barleywine
that
is
worth
seeking
out
d
this
is
one
to
sip
slowly
and
end
the
night
with
although
its
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
pours
a
nice
brownamber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
tan
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
and
small
islands
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
cherries
plums
figs
raisins
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
with
a
nice
touch
of
dark
fruits
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
very
nice
bw
d
a
little
too
bitter
for
my
taste
to
have
this
be
a
beer
i
would
drink
another
of
recommended
overall
not
a
session
beer
this
one
is
a
sipper
but
dont
sip
too
slowly
i
actually
found
my
tongue
completely
assaulted
by
this
beer
near
the
end
i
much
preferred
the
subtle
and
complex
flavours
when
it
was
cold
versus
the
overwhelming
alcohol
bitterness
and
maltiness
as
it
warmed
drinkability
a
tad
harsh
when
fresh
this
is
not
a
session
beer
by
any
means
interesting
barley
wine
for
sure
though
thanks
to
jdv
for
this
one
drinkability
is
good
this
barleywine
seems
to
fit
more
in
the
english
style
rather
than
american
i
wasnt
really
digging
it
at
first
but
then
i
started
to
enjoy
the
soft
subtle
flavors
of
this
one
not
a
bad
approachable
barleywine
o
very
happy
i
picked
up
4
of
these
got
1
more
in
the
cellar
gonig
to
give
another
6
months
to
all
in
all
another
great
beer
from
dieu
du
ciel
not
exactly
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
drinkability
tasty
enjoyable
barleywine
with
a
nice
inviting
warmth
to
it
that
suits
me
just
fine
as
i
watch
the
recent
snow
melt
away
its
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
many
english
version
and
its
not
nearly
as
bitter
as
many
american
iterations
of
the
style
though
admittedly
im
not
entirely
sure
as
to
the
age
of
this
particular
bottle
i
purchased
last
night
why
not
just
pick
a
bottle
and
find
out
for
yourself
drinkability
is
impacted
negatively
by
some
of
the
harsh
tones
i
get
in
the
midrange
flavors
as
well
as
finishing
a
little
too
warm
not
the
most
approachable
barleywine
but
it
was
certainly
decent
overall
into
my
imperial
pint
pour
a
dark
murky
brown
lots
of
junk
floating
about
a
nice
but
small
and
short
lived
head
aroma
is
nice
lots
of
dark
fruits
sweet
some
brandyish
alcohol
same
with
the
taste
also
nice
lots
of
taste
lots
of
sweet
some
nice
fruits
here
too
alcohol
is
well
tempered
the
mouth
is
nice
and
warm
in
all
a
good
beer
for
a
dark
winter
night
notes
its
nice
but
short
of
extraordinary
or
particularly
memorable
however
it
not
that
far
from
it
this
might
benefit
from
some
aging
that
helps
to
integratesubdue
the
hoppy
notes
better
and
give
a
bit
of
a
more
enticing
brew
might
be
an
english
barleywine
given
the
yeast
but
the
way
they
are
used
this
feels
right
at
home
with
some
us
versions
in
terms
of
how
hoppy
its
get
going
during
the
initial
impression
its
complexity
supersedes
its
overall
length
and
semi
lessened
beefier
tone
but
it
sure
sits
well
with
its
crafty
warming
texture
and
drinks
down
with
very
little
effort
a
pretty
solid
offering
by
the
dieu
du
ciel
crew
d
ok
especially
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
d
drinks
european
i
would
buy
again
the
age
was
apparent
right
off
the
bat
had
that
old
ale
after
taste
akin
to
north
coast
old
stock
if
it
aged
a
few
more
years
it
would
be
absolutely
amazing
this
is
my
kind
of
winter
ale
im
going
back
for
more
very
drinkable
despite
a
considerable
amount
of
alcohol
this
is
quite
drinkable
though
a
real
chest
warmer
drinkability
this
is
good
and
very
unique
it
might
sound
blasé
a
bigmalted
barley
wine
with
lots
of
sugar
but
its
beerness
as
opposed
to
wineness
reminds
the
drinker
that
this
style
is
in
fact
an
ale
i
like
it
good
effort
in
the
barleywine
style
by
the
same
brewery
that
makes
my
favorite
beer
péché
mortel
pours
out
a
fairly
dark
brown
with
a
half
finger
head
that
has
very
little
retention
a
ring
of
tan
head
is
left
around
the
sides
with
very
faint
clouds
atop
the
beer
very
little
lacing
sticks
around
on
the
glass
the
beer
itself
has
a
nice
color
with
the
brown
and
red
but
the
head
and
lacing
are
a
let
down
here
right
off
the
bat
in
this
beer
i
get
some
caramel
and
yeast
in
the
aroma
i
get
a
bit
of
an
oxidizedmetallic
scent
too
which
i
find
to
be
pretty
common
in
barleywines
especially
aged
ones
as
mentioned
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
i
really
dont
pick
up
hop
aroma
here
but
get
a
very
good
portion
of
malts
and
caramel
the
problem
here
keeps
coming
back
to
that
oxidized
smell
but
the
other
elements
are
nice
taste
is
basically
the
aroma
without
the
metallic
element
lots
of
malts
and
caramel
flavors
the
malts
profile
is
pretty
much
that
of
a
classic
big
barleywine
a
stale
flavor
like
that
of
old
ales
is
also
present
here
there
is
a
tiny
yeasty
element
in
the
aftertaste
i
get
a
nice
dark
fruit
taste
with
some
cocoa
hints
must
be
some
chocolatedark
malt
in
this
one
alcohol
comes
into
play
in
the
taste
and
the
nose
but
it
is
not
overdone
and
i
pretty
much
expect
it
in
barleywines
that
arent
overhopped
i
do
get
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
here
but
not
anything
huge
the
mouthfeel
is
what
really
hit
me
in
this
beer
the
carbonation
combined
with
the
warming
from
the
high
abv
make
for
a
very
silky
creamy
beer
the
carbs
are
medium
as
is
the
body
very
nice
for
a
barleywine
a
huge
coat
of
cocoa
dark
fruit
and
malts
coat
the
tongue
on
the
way
out
and
for
minutes
afterward
drinkability
is
decent
the
taste
is
good
the
price
sucks
here
in
the
u
s
but
not
bad
up
in
canada
the
looks
and
aroma
come
up
short
here
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
balance
this
beer
out
i
will
continue
to
sample
ddc
beers
as
they
have
been
very
solid
so
far
d
too
heavy
to
session
but
fun
to
try
really
tasty
beer
hars
to
find
even
if
the
beer
is
produced
5
miles
away
from
here
this
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
lighter
liquor
in
a
way
the
body
is
kind
of
thick
and
its
felt
going
down
the
hatch
kinda
smooth
but
at
this
young
stage
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
there
is
some
heat
and
a
small
prick
of
carbonation
medium
to
above
medium
in
stature
the
heat
does
interfer
but
its
expected
i
enjoyed
this
barleywine
and
wish
i
still
had
the
patience
to
cellar
beer
because
in
a
year
or
two
this
should
become
a
winner
d
a
quite
nice
barleywine
overall
not
the
most
complex
member
of
the
bread
but
im
still
happy
i
had
it
d
a
very
good
barleywine
with
a
very
bigfull
body
to
it
particularly
in
its
thick
mouthfeel
bitter
sweet
creamy
all
at
the
same
time
i
dont
know
how
fresh
or
aged
this
is
but
based
on
how
this
tastes
right
now
this
could
continue
to
age
for
a
very
long
time
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
a
great
beer
that
warmed
my
bones
on
a
cold
weekend
night
this
will
age
fantastically
my
first
date
with
brasserie
has
me
lusting
for
more
solstice
dhiver
exceeded
my
expectations
introducing
more
forward
hops
and
less
of
that
syrupy
mouthfeel
that
barley
wines
often
give
poured
a
decent
head
offwhite
and
lasting
stunning
amberbrown
with
red
highlights
i
was
impressed
with
its
smell
not
overbearingly
alcoholic
invitingly
fruity
the
taste
the
taste
layers
of
summer
tree
fruits
something
toasty
burnt
sugar
maybe
bity
hops
and
a
velvety
smooth
finish
holy
shit
i
want
another
this
is
drinkable
as
a
sipper
which
im
sure
is
what
they
intended
in
brewing
this
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
but
at
9
8
one
is
enough
great
winter
beer
i
should
have
saved
this
for
a
colder
night
overall
i
liked
this
beer
it
has
a
really
nice
balance
and
some
very
interesting
flavors
and
aromas
drinkability
it
was
really
good
i
liked
it
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
d
a
highly
drinkable
beer
perfect
for
a
cold
winter
night
very
interesting
and
another
great
beer
form
this
brewery
d
i
do
love
american
barleywines
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
despite
being
almost
10
very
easy
to
drink
and
we
definitely
buy
another
pours
a
rich
amber
with
a
quarter
inch
head
that
retains
itself
quite
nicely
smell
is
rich
malty
with
grassy
hop
notes
taste
mirrors
the
smell
with
a
very
strong
malt
backbone
light
hop
notes
and
a
definite
alcohol
presence
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
a
bit
too
dry
because
of
over
dryness
and
too
obvious
alcohol
drinkability
suffer
slightly
a
modest
abv
for
the
style
which
serves
this
beer
very
well
5
55
is
a
steal
for
a
brew
this
complexhuge
quoff
for
such
a
big
beer
easily
my
favorite
brew
this
cold
season
very
well
done
and
ideal
as
a
winter
warmer
a
really
fun
experience
as
an
extended
sipper
d
the
alcohol
does
not
really
come
through
on
the
palate
the
mild
bitterness
helps
to
keep
things
from
getting
too
sweet
although
i
dont
think
it
would
be
a
problem
when
fresh
anyway
pours
a
murky
darker
brown
color
with
a
little
bit
or
maroon
to
it
around
a
centimeter
of
lightish
head
not
a
lot
of
retention
minimal
lacing
smells
of
brown
sugar
rich
caramel
some
figgy
fruitiness
and
some
alcohol
and
hops
bitterness
flavor
begins
with
a
light
sweetness
that
expands
into
a
fruity
winelike
phenolic
frolic
in
the
mouth
midpalate
is
increasingly
malty
before
the
finish
with
lots
of
hop
bitterness
some
booze
and
a
light
residual
sweetness
fairly
heavy
in
body
with
a
medium
level
of
fizzy
carbonation
all
around
nice
tasting
american
style
barleywine
here
well
executed
but
not
too
exciting
for
my
taste
either
this
type
of
beers
is
not
to
drink
more
than
one
per
session
imo
however
it
isnt
hard
to
drink
one
bottle
so
the
drinkability
is
good
d
quite
a
tasty
barleywine
great
label
glad
to
see
dieu
du
ciel
in
the
states
or
ca
as
it
is
paired
well
with
some
roquefort
cheese
i
had
as
the
denouement
to
a
christmas
dinner
2009
bottle
a
great
interpretation
of
the
style
a
very
dark
amber
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
good
retention
and
nice
lacing
smell
is
a
powerful
fruitiness
with
a
healthy
dose
of
leather
and
oak
flavors
kick
hard
with
a
delicious
malt
roastiness
and
dark
breads
a
raisin
and
prune
fruit
sweetness
flows
through
vanilla
and
oak
a
coffee
like
finish
bitter
and
punchy
with
a
dripping
of
molasses
still
manages
to
be
dry
this
stuff
is
so
complex
and
incredibly
well
crafted
a
full
creamy
texture
is
complimented
by
a
wonderful
light
effervescence
in
the
initial
carbonation
goes
down
a
little
to
quickly
for
a
barleywine
yum
ill
be
cellaring
a
few
of
these
to
date
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
partially
because
it
steps
so
far
out
of
bounds
really
enjoyed
it
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
its
a
barleywine
so
one
was
enough
but
it
sure
went
fast
it
pours
a
dark
brown
and
has
excellent
head
retention
the
sweetness
is
almost
overcome
by
the
alchool
taste
that
lingers
in
your
mouth
the
fruitiness
that
comes
out
of
it
is
not
unpleasent
as
it
is
balanced
with
the
body
a
satisfying
brew
more
suitable
for
dessert
or
a
nightcap
this
beer
grows
on
me
and
the
alcohol
comes
through
more
as
it
warms
up
i
liken
it
to
a
fine
liquor
big
boozy
bottle
of
joy
i
like
it
nice
sipping
beer
a
bit
bitter
but
nice
and
boozy
d
a
very
pleasant
sipper
d
average
offering
imo
best
thing
about
it
were
its
appearance
and
hints
of
elements
on
the
nose
that
didnt
quite
have
the
depth
i
was
looking
for
very
hop
forward
for
the
style
with
a
lot
of
dry
earthy
bitterness
that
is
pretty
well
balanced
by
a
sweet
leathery
caramel
maltiness
and
alcohol
presence
slightly
creamy
medium
body
with
lots
of
toffee
caramel
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
notes
hints
of
fig
apple
raisin
and
prune
pretty
quaffable
considering
the
high
abv
with
subtle
alcohol
heat
and
a
good
bit
of
warmth
in
the
finish
drinkability
a
very
nice
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
very
robust
big
beer
and
not
just
something
to
quench
the
thirst
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
bit
thin
and
not
as
complex
as
i
like
abws
doesnt
drink
at
all
like
its
nearly
10
easy
drinking
and
balanced
another
great
offering
from
dieu
du
ciel
i
really
like
this
one
not
overly
complex
but
very
tasty
my
first
from
this
brewery
and
i
look
for
more
bottle
poured
a
deep
hazy
amber
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
quite
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
dry
fruits
and
toffeecaramel
malt
with
a
light
hoppy
finish
taste
is
also
dominated
by
a
nice
caramel
malt
base
with
notes
of
toffee
and
a
light
fruity
ester
finish
hops
are
present
and
though
not
dominating
i
could
have
done
without
them
which
would
have
brought
this
closer
to
an
english
style
barleywine
well
done
nonetheless
a
mahogany
murky
with
a
very
nice
caramel
quality
warm
and
not
too
boozy
barley
wine
nose
of
maple
syrup
and
tawny
doesnt
have
that
dry
finish
of
zest
clean
and
easy
drinking
but
definitely
intended
for
the
winter
nice
bitter
woody
quality
a
dessert
but
simple
drinkability
due
to
the
strength
of
this
beer
it
gets
knocked
down
a
notch
slow
sipping
beer
but
very
warming
on
a
cold
evening
try
this
one
out
drinkability
is
low
here
cause
of
the
high
abv
this
beer
is
a
bit
young
and
hot
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
again
in
about
612
months
and
see
how
it
evolves
another
hit
from
dieu
du
ciel
a
great
winter
warmer
and
night
cap
something
i
would
highly
recommend
very
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
the
beer
appears
fairly
dark
ive
definitely
seen
lighter
barleywines
it
is
malt
heavy
especially
compared
with
most
us
barleywines
which
i
feel
feature
plentiful
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
and
it
is
very
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
it
almost
tastes
like
a
german
alt
style
beer
but
a
little
sweeter
definitely
some
citus
on
top
of
malted
caramel
goodness
different
than
most
of
the
barleywines
ive
had
so
i
definitely
respect
it
and
will
seek
out
more
beer
from
this
brewery
taste
is
quite
enjoyable
with
lots
of
malt
and
some
hops
overall
a
sweeter
drink
mouthfeel
is
medium
carbonation
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
i
found
this
a
good
winter
warming
barleywine
all
in
all
if
you
like
sweet
brews
then
this
is
for
you
not
a
whole
lot
of
hoppiness
to
it
if
sweet
is
not
your
thing
then
avoid
this
rich
thick
brew
that
positively
qualifies
as
a
barley
wine
not
sweet
but
definitely
malty
the
hop
shows
up
in
the
swallow
but
the
alcohol
is
the
main
feature
after
that
very
warming
good
for
sipping
adding
yet
even
more
evidence
to
my
theory
that
quebec
is
brewing
some
of
the
best
beers
in
canada
drinkability
a
wee
bit
heavy
but
wonderfully
rewarding
great
interplay
between
the
sensory
inputs
which
nicely
overlap
eachother
not
all
to
fresh
n
fruity
wouldve
like
it
if
the
dark
fruits
where
a
bit
more
pronounced
but
this
is
all
pleasantly
compensated
for
by
the
creaminess
of
it
all
pour
a
hazy
molasses
color
with
almost
no
head
some
sediment
floating
aroma
is
of
black
licorice
molasses
and
caramel
taste
is
bitter
from
the
roasted
malt
flavors
with
slight
coffee
in
there
as
well
balanced
by
a
sweeter
caramel
flavor
finishes
slightly
bitter
enjoyable
interpretation
of
a
barleywine
refined
polite
delivers
the
goods
on
a
velvet
carpet
great
stuff
from
this
brewery
good
mouthfeel
rich
and
deep
almost
clingy
not
a
heavy
drinking
beer
d
alcohol
is
apparent
but
it
is
matched
by
thick
flavorfilled
body
a
little
surprising
that
it
is
as
bitter
as
it
is
without
much
hop
character
drinkability
while
this
certainly
isnt
a
bad
barley
wine
i
find
it
to
be
both
dull
and
forgettable
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
md
medium
bodied
and
lowmedium
carbonation
pretty
sticky
on
the
palate
this
gets
hard
to
drink
after
it
warms
this
went
downhill
quickly
d
like
a
belgian
quad
and
an
american
barleywine
had
a
lovely
baby
girl
a
solid
winter
treat
from
a
great
brewery
pours
a
dark
honey
brown
with
a
small
yet
tight
khaki
colored
head
that
settles
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
bready
and
fruity
honey
and
some
fusel
alcohol
as
well
the
taste
is
bready
toasted
malt
with
a
berry
like
fruitiness
a
fairly
bold
stale
grassy
hop
and
some
noticable
booziness
in
the
end
moderate
feel
with
tingly
carbonation
slightly
sticky
but
any
sweetness
on
the
palate
is
crushed
by
the
grassy
hop
bitterness
i
appreciate
that
this
barleywine
is
not
a
sticky
syrupy
sweet
bomb
while
the
abv
is
present
the
earthy
grassy
hops
keeps
this
brew
drinkable
not
my
favorite
style
by
a
mile
but
this
is
well
made
pours
a
thick
rich
brown
with
red
highlights
aroma
is
heavy
with
fruit
and
old
hops
as
a
holiday
beer
this
is
top
notch
boozy
and
warm
the
taste
is
complex
but
clean
not
overpoweringly
sweet
like
some
bws
are
very
well
rounded
and
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
although
it
might
not
be
recommended
to
do
so
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip

and

is
soapy
and
slides

also
with
a
quickness

toasty
malty
sweet
and
spicy
taste
is
big
and
bold
caramel
honey
roasted
malts
and
some
slight
hop
bitterness
alcohol
is
present
and
warming
but
its
rough
edges
are
rounded
by
the
aging
of
the
beer
that
the
brewery
does
im
sure
i
also
assume
that
this
bottle
is
from
last
years
batch
since
i
purchased
it
in
november
and
apparently
this
one
isnt
on
shelves
until
december
unique
and
delicious
beer
as
expected
from
this
brewery
mmmm
mm
good
cracker
great

typical
of
an

an
excellent

has
been
acheived
with

very
drinkable

its
not

id
rather
have
john

just
a

bottle

brown
with
full

lasting
a
good
60
seconds
the
aroma
is
thick
with
dark
fruity
esters
that
seem
a
bit
musty
theyre
mixing
with
roasty
malts
some
alcohol
heat
and
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
a
rich
mix
of
raisins
prunes
and
cherries

mild
notes
of
sweet
malts
roasted
malts
sweet
caramel
and
mildly
herbal

encroach
on
the
bold
fruity
esters
and
move
the
experience
to
the
finish
pretty
hot
and
warming
overall
it
may
benefit
from
additional
aging
i
think
ill
be
seeking
out
a
couple
bottles
to
cellar
a
touch
rough
around
the
edges
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
a
really
wellmade
brew
nonetheless
enjoyed
it
glad
i
got
to
try
it
mouthfeel
is
good

medium
carbonation

drinkability
is
good
nice

good

this
is
no
american
barleywine
but
its
still
tasty
and
it
works
overall
solid
i
would
not
mind
having
this
one
again
and
was
actually
quite
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
well
it
pulled
together
would
grab
another
off
the
shelf
if
i
saw
it
for
sure
medium
bodied
crisp
clean
and
a
load
of
fun
this
beer
has
aged
wonderfully
the
crystal
clear
dark
brown
color
with
the
off
white
head
that
rescindes
its
place
at
the
top
leaving
a
bit
of
lace
around
edge
of
the
glass
the
aroma
brings
a
nice
amount
of
toffee
and
dark
fruit
to
the
party
just
complimenting
the
malt
that
they
started
with
the
taste
is
wonderfully
fruity
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
at
the
end
the
full
body
and
good
carbonation
make
this
a
wonderfully
drinkable
barley
wine
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
almost
brown
color
with
a
14
offwhite
head
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
wonderful
burnt
toffee
aroma
thats
warming
yet
sweet
and
inviting
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
nice
hop
bite
thats
complimented
by
a
really
awesome
toffee
flavor
it
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
warm
and
earthy
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
barleywine
i
love
the
hop
and
malt
character
well
done
d
ah
very
nice
and
a
great
experience
this
was
a
bit
of
a
suprise
but
i
usually
expect
quality
from
ddc
the
aroma
is
just
crazy
amazing
it
takes
a
lot
to
pull
my
nose
from
the
snifter
every
thing
else
is
good
to
damn
good
this
does
take
time
to
consume
on
part
of
the
abv
this
is
a
bit
hot
and
is
slow
going
for
me
maybe
a
year
or
so
of
rest
will
cool
it
off
and
raise
the
drinkability
score
with
that
said
i
would
buy
this
again
whenever
i
wanted
a
good
barleywine
mouthfeel
is
think
warm
and
lingering
d
overall
this
is
a
really
tasty
barleywinethere
is
a
lot
of
booze
with
this
one
so
i
do
think
it
would
benefit
from
a
couple
years
aging
but
it
is
still
very
good
fresh
this
is
really
good

a
strong
candidate
for
cellaring
as
it
has
a
ton
of
character
and
depth
age
would
likely
mellow
the
alcohol
regardless
this
will
always
be
a
sipper
oily
bitterness
tangles
with
residual
sweetness
to
form
an
impression
of
power
without
getting
silly
on
it
with
home
made
mexican
pizzas
it
is
delicious
offering
more
fruit
and
spice
than
an
analytical
study
seems
to
yield
what
an
interesting
beer
it
sort
of
has
an
identity
crisis
its
not
sure
if
it
wants
to
be
a
barleywine
or
a
belgian
i
dig
it
none
the
less
thanks
cosmohophead
this
brew
pours
a
very
dirty
and
cloudy
dark
red
with
a
thin
lacy
head
offwhite
head
aroma
is
top
notch
bourbon
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
a
little
of
that
boozy
quality
all
the
good
barley
wines
have
taste
follows
the
same
slightly
sweet
and
boozy
but
is
still
nicely
balanced
a
very
nice
american
barley
wine
all
around
pours
an
attractive
medium
brown
with
a
lasting
whitish
middle
barleywine
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
above
average
a
smooth
barleywine
with
a
lovely
drinkable
caramel
nice
balance
satisfying
although
boozy
thanks
for
bringing
me
back
a
bottle
derek
this
beer
was
poured
into
a
snifter
it
had
a
hazy
redbrown
color
almost
a
muddy
appearance
and
a
wisp
of
a
head
nice
caramel
aroma
light
vanilla
hoppy
caramel
taste
the
alcohol
was
barely
perceptable
maybe
a
touch
on
the
bitter
side
but
still
a
good
barleywine
pours
a
mahogany
color
with
a
shallow
wispy
light
tan
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
little
belgian
lacing
persent
the
smell
is
classic
sweet
malty
barleywine
caramel
and
hints
of
vanilla
alcohol
lightly
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
tangy
with
simillar
notes
of
the
alcohol
the
9
8
abv
is
not
hidden
nor
offensive
the
caramel
butterscotch
flavors
are
a
good
interpretation
of
style
a
mighty
fine
sipper
d
first
34
of
this
one
are
pretty
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
the
finish
grows
a
bit
too
strong
for
my
taste
the
flavor
is
sweet
malt
with
toffee
and
dark
fruits
mixing
and
rolling
to
a
bit
of
astringent
alcohol
bite
on
the
finish
makes
for
a
bit
of
a
sipper
due
to
the
bite
but
otherwise
a
tasty
treat
that
i
would
recommend
to
folks
who
like
big
beers
with
no
hops
d
the
medicinal
taste
is
way
too
strong
and
nothing
i
ever
want
to
taste
again
needless
to
say
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
this
again
different
in
a
bad
way
i
say
avoid
well
despite
the
burning
bubbles
im
impressed
this
is
definitely
unique
for
the
style
from
the
color
to
the
charcoal
flavors
though
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
sticky
sweetness
to
mask
the
abv
im
still
enjoying
this
one
though
not
enough
to
make
me
run
out
and
buy
a
case
even
at
the
low
low
price
of
5
50bottle
pours
a
super
dark
ruby
red
a
little
red
winey
the
highlights
are
a
totally
cool
blood
spicey
hops
sweet
toasted
candylike
malts
and
warm
alcohol
the
front
of
the
palate
is
syrupy
and
candy
sweet
the
hops
balance
out
the
malty
sweetness
while
the
alcohol
warms
and
has
a
som
astrigent
qualities
the
finish
is
long
and
lingering
boozey
taste
and
feel
retty
sippable
but
too
much
booze
poured
a
dark
ruby
color
with
good
carbonation
and
dirty
white
head
nose
is
brown
sugar
dried
fruits
caramel
and
sweet
tastes
is
caramel
toffee
dried
fruit
and
brown
sugar
i
thought
it
tasted
very
good
mouthfeel
was
sweet
sticky
syrupy
but
easy
drinking
and
smooth
too
i
really
dug
this
barleywine
drinkability
a
sipper
for
sure
w
the
abv
damn
near
10
and
the
thickish
mouthfeel
its
not
a
quaffer
solstice
dhiver
is
a
real
disappointment
from
a
usually
fun
brewery
this
and
the
peppercorn
beer
the
crazed
canucks
create
are
two
beers
that
i
find
personally
unpalatable
a
real
shame
but
id
be
curious
to
try
an
aged
bottle
and
see
if
this
changes
much
over
time
i
will
definitely
get
this
one
again
provided
i
can
find
it
of
a
similar
vintage
12oz
bottle
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
ruby
tinges
and
a
medium
eggshell
head
just
a
bit
of
sediment
smells
of
roasted
malt
raisin
quite
a
bit
of
spice
the
typical
dieu
du
ciel
yeast
and
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
tastes
strongly
of
sweet
roasty
crystal
malt
a
lot
of
hop
bitterness
and
some
earthiness
surprisingly
bitter
finish
with
some
warming
alcohol
thick
body
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
what
bigfoot
aspires
to
be
beer
poured
into
my
rochefort
chalice
little
head
and
no
lacing
to
speak
of
color
is
a
gorgeous
burgundy
smell
is
molasses
brown
sugar
cinnamon
and
caramel
initial
taste
is
sweet
with
heavy
alcohol
then
the
hops
appear
and
just
get
stronger
all
the
way
through
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
chewy
this
was
one
of
the
more
unique
barleywines
that
ive
tried
conclusion
this
is
a
nice
rich
perfectly
balanced
and
quite
drinkable
barleywine
d
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
strong
but
its
an
interesting
and
subtle
barleywine
overall
a
good
beer
from
an
intriguing
brewery
that
keeps
me
trying
em
all
drinkablity
very
rich
and
complex
strong
truely
a
sipper
d
a
tasty
barleywine
big
hoppiness
as
expected
and
the
malt
is
deep
w
yeast
interplay
creating
a
tasty
lightshade
effect
i
would
definitely
want
a
chance
to
savor
this
again
perhaps
with
some
age
on
it
to
see
how
it
changes
and
smoothes
out
the
hop
bitterness
a
very
good
barleywine
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
and
even
a
vigorous
pour
could
barely
muster
a
head
aromas
of
brown
sugar
dark
dried
fruits
toffee
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
smells
like
its
going
to
be
sweet
tastes
of
raisins
brown
and
burnt
sugars
alcohol
slight
hop
bite
in
the
middle
leaves
a
lingering
sweetness
on
a
semi
dry
finish
carbonation
is
barely
there
mouthfeel
is
sweet
and
sticky
body
is
full
i
would
have
liked
some
carbonation
and
it
was
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
decent
brew
deceptively
drinkable
dieu
du
ciel
is
a
funny
brewery
i
love
péché
mortel
but
have
been
somewhat
disappointed
with
their
other
bottled
offerings
im
hoping
their
other
big
guns
chaman
laphrodisiaque
déesse
nocturne
that
are
only
ontap
live
up
to
the
hype
d
fairly
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
and
pretty
damn
tasty
nice
barley
wine
from
a
very
good
brewery
pours
a
hazy
chestnut
with
little
head
bubblegum
and
citrusy
hop
aromas
some
caramel
and
a
fairly
big
booziness
in
the
nose
big
in
your
face
taste
but
the
various
compononents
are
nicely
balanced
lots
of
hop
bitterness
more
bubblegum
sweet
malt
and
laced
with
alcohol
and
grapefruit
beautiful
sipper
for
the
fireside
tannic
and
sweet
in
the
mouth
and
loaded
with
flavor
in
every
sip
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
pours
quite
dark
brown
and
fairly
foggy
with
a
thick
crème
head
thats
going
nowhere
nose
is
quite
fruit
toned
apricots
perfume
floral
edges
if
you
really
focus
on
the
fragrance
that
apricot
shows
through
beautifully
flavor
is
a
bit
boozy
grainy
malts
subdued
fruits
figs
but
the
alcohol
is
present
feel
is
smooth
on
liquid
appropriately
lower
on
carbonation
this
is
still
young
i
say
give
it
three
or
four
more
years
and
this
is
going
to
be
golden
lots
of
potential
but
not
at
its
peak
right
now
fluffy
carbonation
that
sits
just
on
the
border
of
fizzy
and
really
does
a
nice
job
of
complementing
the
hops
note
nicely
put
together
beer
this
one
was
pretty
green
and
needs
another
year
to
age
but
if
its
on
the
market
it
should
be
ready
mouth
is
a
little
full
with
the
heavy
sweetness
not
what
i
would
call
a
real
drinkable
beer
but
i
never
rate
drinkability
on
how
many
i
think
i
could
down
in
a
sitting
preferring
to
think
of
it
as
more
of
an
overall
impression
and
if
i
would
want
another
one
for
this
beer
its
a
definate
yes
as
long
as
the
weather
stays
cool
a
great
sipper
on
a
cold
winter
night
pretty
drinkable
for
a
beer
that
is
creeping
up
on
10abv
overall
solstice
dhiver
is
a
very
good
american
barleywine
notes
this
is
tasty
and
id
get
it
again
the
spiciness
really
adds
to
the
alcohol
warmth
and
makes
this
feel
like
a
winter
beer
dissapointing
would
not
get
this
again
d
this
beer
shows
some
really
good
promise
for
aging
the
nose
was
really
good
but
the
hops
seem
to
overwhelm
in
the
mouth
very
nice
fruit
flavors
and
compexity
none
the
less
thin
mouthfeel
watery
low
carbonation
not
very
drinkable
really
boozey
maybe
would
mellow
with
some
age
d
pretty
good
but
not
something
i
think
i
would
ever
desire
worth
trying
and
easy
to
drink
very
intense
very
nice
mouthfeel
low
drinkability
this
is
a
very
good
hoppedup
interpretation
of
a
barleywine
drinkability
this
beer
was
not
far
from
perfection
was
a
bit
picky
on
the
appearance
but
was
basing
it
on
the
fact
that
i
have
seen
a
good
handful
of
the
same
style
and
abv
beer
that
have
looked
a
bit
better
as
for
the
taste
pretty
damn
good
possibly
a
bit
off
style
according
to
the
label
but
ba
has
the
right
style
imo
damn
great
beer
worth
seeking
out
d
this
smelled
great
and
tasted
pretty
good
too
it
is
certainly
worth
picking
up
it
is
not
bad
maybe
its
only
the
style
thats
not
my
favorite
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
full
and
decent
carbonation
is
light
but
might
be
nice
to
take
the
edge
of
the
herbs
if
youre
not
into
that
flavor
i
am
notes
of
cherry
and
even
a
hint
of
red
wine
emerge
as
the
beer
warms
this
doesnt
make
it
more
drinkable
but
it
somehow
seems
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
barleywine
spectrum
so
ive
bumped
the
drink
score
up
a
bit
d
a
little
on
the
raw
side
sort
of
reminds
me
of
my
early
forays
into
barleywines
1516
years
ago
it
was
nice
to
reminice
though
this
couldve
used
more
time
in
the
bottle
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
somewhat
thin
d
this
was
unique
and
a
real
pleasure
to
try
body
is
creamy
and
just
a
touch
sticky
very
ideal
for
a
barleywine
this
is
a
pleasant
tasty
barleywine
that
has
great
depth
of
flavor
i
would
expect
nothing
less
from
diue
du
ciel
one
of
my
favorite
new
to
me
breweries
of
2008
this
is
a
great
winter
sipper
sitting
here
up
north
while
it
below
zero
out
side
nice
brew
like
i
said
i
will
grab
another
one
to
age
for
next
year
poured
a
medium
and
muddy
brown
color
with
a
smaller
sized
off
white
head
aromas
of
caramel
toffee
dark
fruits
a
little
roasty
lightly
woody
and
some
nuttiness
tastes
of
dark
fruits
caramel
some
nuts
and
a
little
earthy
light
to
medium
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
smooth
balanced
layered
nuanced
really
long
finish
with
the
caramel
malt
and
dry
hops
dominating
and
filling
the
mouth
candied
apples
and
dry
malt
work
together
and
endure
to
create
a
long
lasting
taste
but
well
not
a
bad
beer
in
any
way
still
i
think
the
bitterness
was
a
little
too
simple
for
this
style
p
s
got
my
hands
on
a
weird
10
2
abv
batch
during
the
fall
before
the
actual
release
of
the
beer
aged
it
7
months
and
boy
it
is
soooo
smoother
than
the
normal
version
i
wont
adjust
my
score
since
it
could
have
been
a
one
time
thing
but
its
hotd
smooth
burgundy
colored
ale
with
a
filmy
lasting
white
head
aroma
is
the
weak
spot
but
still
shows
some
malt
and
hop
character
flavor
has
some
depth
to
it
and
is
very
complex
with
a
nice
balance
between
bold
hop
and
malt
notes
caramel
and
toffee
with
sprucelike
hops
very
nice
mouth
feel
to
this
bad
boy
pretty
nice
barley
wine
with
some
nice
short
term
cellar
potential
overall
a
solid
effort
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
the
bitterness
but
the
caramel
and
red
fruit
are
nice
murky
tawny
colour
with
coppery
edges
a
thin
cap
of
fine
tanbeige
bubbles
formed
during
the
pour
and
ringed
the
glass
with
lace
good
head
retention
quite
sticky
caramel
and
sugar
in
the
aroma
along
with
mild
alcohol
herbal
hops
a
little
grassy
sweet
fruits
bready
and
doughy
flavour
lots
of
malt
up
front
some
caramel
then
growing
alcohol
into
the
finish
bitterness
was
present
but
subdued
and
balance
for
the
malt
was
provided
more
by
the
alcohol
which
had
a
bit
of
spiciness
to
it
herbal
hop
notes
lingered
on
the
back
of
my
palate
long
into
the
finish
sort
of
minty
a
bit
of
sherry
and
cherry
as
it
warmed
but
less
fruit
overall
than
in
the
aroma
medium
plus
bodied
lightish
carbonation
that
was
fairly
creamy
lots
of
alcohol
warmth
a
bit
of
a
different
take
on
a
barleywine
seemed
appropriate
for
the
holiday
season
overall
dont
know
if
this
one
should
be
characterized
as
an
american
or
english
bw
hops
were
american
but
the
rest
was
more
towards
the
english
type
but
smell
and
taste
were
either
way
a
bit
thin
and
weak
drinkability
excellent
i
might
get
some
more
bottles
if
they
are
not
out
of
them
already

you
overall
disappointed
especially
considering

its

however
for

with

it
fell

of
a

leaves
a

kinda

my
first
beer
from
boulder
beer
i
will
drink
this

and
try
their

harsh
to
drink
it
actually
tasted
like
there
was
more

i
was
intrigued
by
the
dreadful
rating
an
early
batch
received
methinks
revisiting
that
may
be
warranted
overall
really
good
overall
definitely
underrated
which
is
probably
because
its
not
15
and
barrel
aged
this
is
a
flavorful
enjoyable
barleywine
with
plenty
of
character
and
it
drinks
away
far
too
easily
perhaps
a
little
more
residual
sweetness
would
help
put
this
over
the
edge
in
this
category
but
as
it
is
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
and
would
gladly
drink
it
again

with

not

not

holy

that

made
this

it
was
a

still
had

quite
a

with

and
even
hints
of
bubblegum
immediately
their
to
greet
your
taste
buds
the
malts
supply
some
grain
flavor
while
the
hops
donate
a
dry
bitterness
the
latter
coming
through
in
the

half
offering
great
stability
to
the
aforementioned
sweetness
this

while
the
alcohol
hides
itself
niftily
throughout
each
sip
mouthfeel
on
this
brew
is
super
solid
light
and
somewhat
bubbly
on
the
forefront
and
solid
and
full
on
the
way
down
but
never
being
too
light
or
too
full
in
any
aspect
somewhat
of
a
roller
coaster
of
a
beer
but
shit
who
dont
love
roller

not
what
i
expected

a

collection

i
would
love

o
meh
wish
id
shared
this

this

instead
of
drinking
it
alone
mostly
hot

from
a

a

a

and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
one
of
these
per
session
is
plenty
overall
very
pleasantly
surprised
ratings
have
this
guy
as
mediocre
i
guess
and
80
as
i
review
maybe
im
a
philistine
but
this
beer
deserves
better
imo
pours

overall
good

the
only

is
the

that
enhances
the
body
and
aroma
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
wax
topped
argh
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
i
gotta
think
the
bros
got
a
bad
bottle
this
is
a
really
good
brew
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
one
cest
la
vie
while
not
a
bad
tipple
overall
this
one
seems
to
have
a
bit
of
a
problem
choosing
sides
in
the
whole
is
it
or
isnt
it
barleywine
heritage
debate
instead
deciding
to
go
off
on
a
weakass
side
project
of
its
own
i
e
dumb
everything
down
just
a
bit
i
swear
i
get
a
bit
of
malt
liquor
pick
yer
favourite
bottom
shelf
purveyor
essence
when
i
close
my
eyes
and
turn
my
brain
off
maybe
thats
more
telling
than
anything
i
have
and
will
still
yet
consider
about
this
particular
offering
huh
ok
i
really
cant
put
my
finger
on
this
one
to
me
its
certainly
not
terrible
but
its
just
a
little
too
sweet
and
id
like
to
see
more
of
the
malt
character
and
less
of
the
fruitiness
come
through
a
little
more
hop
flavor
to
balance
theres
not
much
whatsoever
would
also
be
nice
too
sweet
for
my
palate
but
definitely
not
a
drain
poor
either
i
think
if
i
would
come
back
to
this
in
the
winter
as
a
dessert
beer
i
might
like
it
more
interesting
overall
a
not
bad
barleywine
but
could
use
more
depth
of
flavor
note
2013

with
a
fair

fair

and
good

head
didnt
hold
all
that
well
though
aroma
is
of
sweet
toffee
malts
earthy
hops
and
a
bit
of
oaklike
wood
high
carbonation
and
medium

give
it
a
pretty
enjoyable
mouthfeel
taste
follows

very
closely
reddish

is
a

description
but
it
would
be
cheesy
to
copy
the
description
off
the
bottle
label
with
perfect
clarity
poured
with
a
fluffy
rich
white
foam
with
nice
retention
that
left
lots
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
sweet
caramel
malt
aroma
with
boozy
notes
the
thicker
side
of
medium
bodied
with
slightly
subdued
carbonation
and
a
slick
oily
feel
sweet
caramel
malt
flavor
with
light
hop
bitterness
through
the
middle
boozy
notes
toward
the
end
and
a
sweet
sticky
finish
a
very
malt
forward
ale
with
little
hop
character
interesting
flavors
but
the
overall
finished
product
just
doesnt
really
stand
out
compared
to
other
barleywines
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
recommend
this
to
someone
but
it
also
isnt
a
great
example
of
the
style
the
yeast
fruit
is
just
a
bit
too
strong
in
the
end
overall
i
like
it
but
i
seem
to
remember
liking
it
more
the
first
time
i
tried
it
i
guess
the
worst
i
can
say
is
that
it
is
best
enjoyed
by
splitting
a
bottle
with
a
friend
the
sweetness
becomes
a
bit
too
much
as
i
near
the
last
few
ounces
i
feel
it
could
be
better
with
a
little
stronger
hop
profile
that
being
said
i
will
be
buying
it
again
next
winter
while
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
not
much
of
an
american
barleywine
its
too
sweet
and
never
penalizes
your
palate
dare
i
say
a
10
abv
barleywine
is
a
bit
girly
overall
really
nice
beer
to
have
now
i
can
see
this
settling
nice
in
about
6
months
light
acidity
on
it
and
kind
of
nice
feel
of
tannins
good
beer
killer
penguin
was
pretty
good
it
just
does
not
have
what
it
takes
to
be
something
i
would
ever
seek
out
again
i
am
glad
i
let
my
curiosity
get
the
best
of
me
to
try
it
however
the
muted
barleywine
flavors
and
the
way
they
all
come
together
just
do
not
work
and
i
do
not
think
any
amount
of
aging
will
help
this
beer
one
of
those
nothing
special
or
remarkable
but
done
really
really
well
im
not
really
feeling
this
one
at
all
very
disappointing
it
has
a
weak
nose
and
off
flavors
not
really
worth
checking
out

my
opinion

a

the

its
a

easygoing
i
would
say
though
it
has
a
firm
crispness
and
it
flows
pretty
smoothly
overall
im
really
enjoying
this
beer
i
particularly
like
the
smooth
fruity
nature
of
the
penguin
i
feel
like
i
could
accidentally
get
into
a
lot
of
trouble
drinking
this
based
on
how
easily
it
goes
down
overall
this
is
a
solid
barleywine
that
is
great
for
aging
ive
never
opened
a
killer
penguin
yet
right
after
purchasing
it
but
if
you
have
the
patience
to
age
it
for
a
year
or
two
id
recommend
it
o
a
decent
barleywine
that
im
assuming
has
mellowed
in
its
3
years
i
need
to
try
it
fresh
but
i
sure
wish
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
smells
very
middle
of
the
road
balanced
and
inoffensive
o
not
bad
but
not
great
for
a
fresh
american
barleywine
its
pretty
light
on
hop
flavor
the
alcohol
is
there
for
sure
and
the
malts
are
pretty
solid
a
bit
more
english
than
american
in
my
opinion
o
a
good
brew
no
doubt
much
better
than
the
bros
rating
would
leave
you
to
believe
tend
to
enjoy
this
one
more
in
the
winter
overall
a
disappointment
closer
to
an
american
strong
ale
than
a
barleywine
too
many
really
good
ones
out
there
to
pick
up
this
one
again
drink
a
pretty
good
barleywine
with
a
lot
of
flavors
that
blended
well
and
were
fairly
citrus
forward
i
have
liked
the
few
boulder
beers
i
have
had
and
then
this
was
no
different
the
booze
wasnt
that
over
bearing
would
like
an
aged
bottle
to
try
overall
not
bad
for
10
abv
overall
i
dug
this
based
on
the
reviews
i
wasnt
sure
how
this
would
be
going
in
but
i
enjoyed
my
session
its
big
and
bold
and
different
will
look
to
purchase
again
and
set
the
bird
down
for
a
year
or
so
the
10
is
evident
but
enjoyable
cheers
o
overall
this
beer
is
like
an
odd
blend
of
trying
to
be
big
and
flavorfulstrong
but
somewhat
drinkable
at
the
same
time
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
just
not
packing
the
punch
ive
come
to
expect
from
the
style
it
certainly
isnt
bad
but
there
are
plenty
of
other
better
options
in
this
style
o
pretty
standard
american
barleywine
but
not
as
hoppy
in
taste
as
i
wanted
to
balance
the
sweetness
o
not
a
bad
barleywine
the
10
is
not
that
noticable
at
all
which
is
kinda
scary
easily
drinkable
but
could
probably
benifit
from
some
aging
i
would
probably
buy
this
again
i
have
4
bottles
of
2012
left
and
a
bottle
of
2011
my
only
hope
is
that
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
mellows
out
over
time
and
it
becomes
better
we
shall
see
o
surprisingly
little
booze
at
10
abv
the
flavor
profile
is
a
little
too
sweet
and
theres
a
light
waxy
note
that
feels
off
but
other
than
that
its
not
bad
if
i
came
across
another
id
put
a
few
years
on
it
before
opening
a
very
drinkable
barleywine
in
my
book
2012
vintage
enjoyed
in
a
snifter
the
pour
is
mostly
clear
copper
color
with
lazy
but
hearty
off
white
lacing
the
nose
is
quite
fruity
dried
cherries
stand
out
but
red
apple
and
plum
may
also
be
present
lots
of
alcohol
as
well
as
light
vanilla
and
oak
notes
tickle
the
nose
points
off
for
it
being
a
little
too
boozy
but
it
smells
decadent
all
the
same
the
flavor
is
fruit
first
with
the
cherries
again
being
the
main
player
toffee
and
english
caramalt
round
out
an
otherwise
caustic
alcohol
sting
and
a
little
whiskey
sweetness
lingers
on
after
the
swallow
the
alcohol
becomes
even
more
of
an
issue
as
it
warms
stopping
short
of
cleaning
solvent
especially
in
the
nose
feel
is
fine
rather
light
in
body
for
the
style
but
not
thin
or
watery
at
all
just
not
as
heavily
clad
with
malty
heft
as
these
usually
are
gentle
carbonation
does
not
detract
from
the
flavor
experience
overall
a
cool
holiday
barleywine
i
enjoyed
the
fruit
forward
side
of
this
but
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
might
help
get
the
booze
under
control
an
easy
bomber
to
split
with
a
loved
one
some
night
when
you
plan
to
stay
in
come
on
boulder
i
had
your
black
diamond
chocolate
porter
the
other
day
and
it
was
delicious
this
is
a
complete
messterpiece
this
is
a
fine
beer
however
it
sacrifices
flavors
for
hop
bitterness
and
high
alcohol
best
sipped
while
enjoying
a
meal
d
not
bad
it
has
a
really
promising
aroma
but
doesnt
have
the
same
level
of
hop
character
in
the
flavor
profile
still
drinkable
and
smooth
this
one
was
over
a
year
old
and
seems
to
have
aged
favorably
overall
certainly
more
drinkable
from
the
start
than
your
average
barelwine
with
the
abv
well
hidden
although
drinkablitly
improves
because
of
these
characteristics
this
one
comes
across
a
bit
watery
all
the
flavors
here
are
pretty
faint
and
its
a
bit
boozy
what
flavor
does
get
past
the
alcohol
is
good
but
im
looking
for
much
more
from
a
barleywine
ill
look
elsewhere
this
pours
amber
with
low
retention
it
smells
sweet
with
figs
in
the
nose
it
has
a
big
boozy
taste
and
then
it
fades
to
a
sweet
after
taste
it
is
decently
carbonated
and
has
a
big
body
this
is
an
ok
barleywine
from
the
22
oz
bottle
2011
vintage
so
this
ones
going
on
a
year
old
from
grapevine
liquors
in
denver
overall
a
very
good
american
style
barleywine
a
mildly
cloudy
orangebrown
on
the
pour
with
a
large
and
frothy
pale
yellow
head
leaving
nice
lacing
oak
molasses
and
pine
are
strong
in
the
aroma
while
tones
of
sugared
fruits
creamy
malt
and
hops
strong
blast
of
fermented
apples
cover
up
most
of
the
other
subtle
flavors
such
as
molasses
and
wet
wood
body
is
relatively
flat
in
overall
flavor
with
a
sweet
malty
mouthfeel

ounfortunately
this
is
the
first
beer
from
boulder
brewery
i
have
to
give
a
subpar
rating
to
they
just
missed
the
mark
barleywines
are
meant
to
be
big
like
wine
this
tastes
like
a
ramped
up
amber
ale
with
too
much
going
on
and
the
flavors
dont
explode
like
they
should
perhaps
a
year
of
aging
might
subdue
the
booze
and
bring
out
the
malts
but
im
not
seeking
this
one
out
again
o
when
i
have
little
to
say
about
a
barleywine
the
better
that
means
its
doing
its
job
of
staying
drinkable
even
if
its
not
very
complex
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
hazed
infused
but
this
is
a
very
decent
barleywine
simply
amazing
enjoy
now
or
cellar
for
a
few
years
pours
a
medium
copper
color
that
looks
a
little
thin
around
the
edges
when
held
to
the
light
there
is
a
nice
one
to
one
and
a
half
finger
off
white
head
which
gives
way
to
nice
strands
of
lace
the
aroma
has
a
caramel
malt
backbone
and
then
a
sweet
fruity
aroma
the
backend
has
a
slight
citrus
kick
the
taste
starts
out
bready
with
caramel
malt
and
then
gives
way
to
a
fruity
taste
along
with
a
slight
citrus
kick
at
the
end
the
fruit
appears
to
be
a
grape
or
plum
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
lowly
carbonated
and
a
bit
watery
overall
it
was
an
okay
beer
however
i
would
peg
it
more
in
the
english
category
than
the
american
for
a
barelywine
o
a
bit
underwhelming
not
overly
complex
or
interesting
its
decent
dont
get
me
wrong
but
for
a
10
barleywine
with
a
wax
coated
cap
i
expect
more
probably
a
good
barleywine
for
a
newnovice
craft
drinker
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
but
a
substandard
barleywine
flavors
are
not
complex
nor
will
they
become
complex
overtime
this
may
have
been
better
fresh
with
more
hop
character
but
maybe
the
ethanol
was
more
dominant
then
as
well
idk
just
not
a
well
made
beer
in
my
opinion
o
the
alcohol
burn
is
something
i
like
to
see
in
this
style
but
here
its
overkill
without
the
burn
maybe
this
is
a
mediocre
barleywine
i
was
surprised
this
wasnt
scored
higher
poured
a
2
beige
head
with
decent
lifespan
the
body
is
a
hazy
burnt
sienna
brown
in
masstone
but
held
to
the
light
theres
a
deep
amber
it
smells
nicely
of
malt
caramel
and
toffee
the
taste
mirrors
the
smells
and
is
a
little
salty
the
body
during
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
watery
but
it
does
have
a
long
finish
as
well
as
a
subtle
low
note
of
hops
lasting
in
the
end
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
not
a
knockout
the
presentation
does
add
something
and
the
beer
gets
good
points
on
the
pour
and
nose
from
me
the
taste
leaves
something
to
be
desired
even
among
the
american
styles
i
like
to
detect
some
richer
malts
in
a
barleywine
the
hops
in
the
taste
are
perfect
but
they
arent
probably
balanced
by
the
malt
the
remainder
of
the
beer
is
enjoyable
but
nothing
special
sweet
and
sticky
aromas
of
caramel
toffee
and
a
little
bit
boozy
even
after
a
slumber
in
my
cellar
the
flavor
is
similar
and
it
lacks
some
punch
complexity
and
depth
the
texture
is
a
touch
thin
but
the
carbonation
is
on
point
a
reasonably
welldone
barleywine
i
am
happy
i
passed
on
the
case
before
trying
a
bottle
o
overall
fantastic
i
had
actually
been
looking
for
this
beer
for
quite
some
time
not
having
realized
that
it
was
a
every
two
years
release
very
good
served
in
a
snifter
this
beer
is
missing
something
although
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
exactly
what
it
is
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
caramel
and
the
lacing
is
heavy
on
the
head
that
lingers
for
a
long
time
the
color
is
deep
mahogany
the
hops
are
noticible
and
pleasant
and
the
taste
is
pleasant
but
lacking
perhaps
it
needs
a
bigger
malt
presence
im
not
quite
sure
i
like
the
flavor
i
just
wish
it
was
bigger
in
this
beer
certainy
not
disappointing
but
not
quite
what
i
was
looking
for
an
ok
beer
for
the
price
not
really
worth
it
and
i
was
hoping
for
more
the
barrel
treatment
is
virtually
unnoticeable
poured
ontap
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
deep
dark
auburn
coloring
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
fluffy
small
bubbled
light
tan
head
of
a
good
half
inch
malty
and
rich
aromas
with
a
good
boozey
highlight
some
light
spicing
and
a
touch
of
hops
good
bold
flavors
that
are
very
well
balanced
good
hops
profile
that
touches
the
tip
of
the
tongue
but
settles
in
on
the
midtongue
malty
profile
is
rich
with
a
crystal
and
roasted
caramel
palate
good
toasty
characteristics
to
draw
everything
together
leading
to
a
peppery
hopped
aftertaste
with
a
little
kiss
of
the
booze
again
decent
cling
along
the
glass
while
you
drink
the
finish
is
surprisingly
light
with
only
a
slightly
sweet
linger
that
is
very
tasty
and
pleasant
good
tasting
brew
but
im
not
sure
how
it
would
hold
up
over
time
i
am
curious
enough
to
try
it
this
is
a
tasty
barleywine
some
alcohol
is
present
but
it
works
well
with
the
taste
o
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
solid
barleywine
granted
i
need
to
try
this
fresh
as
comparison
but
with
3
years
on
it
it
is
pretty
tasty
nothing
earth
shattering
and
having
king
henry
a
few
days
ago
not
much
would
seem
to
compare
however
i
have
read
a
lot
of
negative
reviews
of
this
one
and
i
guess
i
dont
get
that
in
this
bottle
overall
an
odd
little
barleywine
i
think
this
retailed
for
around
10
or
so
a
bottle
for
that
price
its
not
bad
the
toasted
nut
flavors
are
really
nice
if
a
bit
odd
yet
the
thin
body
and
a
bit
of
residual
alcoholic
heat
take
away
from
this
a
bit
also
theres
very
little
depth
i
dunno
what
this
is
like
fresh
and
i
could
almost
justify
buying
it
again
if
it
wasnt
for
the
fact
that
schlafly
makes
an
oakaged
barleywine
for
around
11
that
with
23
years
on
it
is
sublime
a
bit
overpriced
not
the
best
bwine
yet
still
a
good
one
a
bit
basic
o
liked
this
one
easy
drinker
despite
the
10
abv
subtle
for
a
barleywine
aging
one
and
curious
to
see
how
it
does
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
overall
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
and
may
do
better
with
even
more
age
on
it
45
years
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
not
bad
here
nothing
too
spectacular
but
one
id
be
happy
to
have
again
the
body
is
medium
and
a
little
bit
sticky
good
carbonation
overall
not
bad
but
i
think
id
pass
in
the
future
there
are
just
more
available
barelywines
that
i
enjoy
a
bit
more
overall
kinda
meh
not
too
bad
but
sweeter
and
very
syrupy
decent
malts
but
not
great
hops
are
there
but
meh
o
3
5
slightly
better
than
the
09
version
the
lesson
learned
was
to
drink
this
stuff
as
fresh
as
possible
as
with
age
it
becomes
garbage
o
i
couldnt
enjoy
this
one
maybe
it
was
netter
when
fresh
but
way
too
sweet
and
pretty
much
no
hop
character
once
again
the
taste
is
dominated
by
malt
the
fruit
and
citrus
also
come
through
a
lot
bitterness
seems
about
right
but
the
lack
of
any
sort
of
hop
presence
makes
this
one
just
boring
o
pretty
good
beer
honestly
the
abv
is
only
sort
of
noticeable
and
the
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
went
well
with
dinner
m
weak
honestly
medium
bodied
alcohol
packs
a
punch
but
it
leaves
me
wanting
more
this
is
much
better
than
i
anticipated
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
thoroughly
perhaps
this
beer
is
at
its
prime
for
my
taste
anyway
id
guess
that
its
probably
78
months
old
id
say
this
one
is
worth
sitting
in
your
cellar
it
doesnt
cost
much
after
all
o
overall
a
good
barleywine
for
the
price
and
definitely
worth
the
6
month
wait
to
drink
aging
my
other
bottle
to
compare
against
a
fresh
2011
release
my
rating

if
aged
d

goes
down
very
easily
not

representation
of

as

hophead
i
prefer
my
abws
with
more
hops
bitterness
but
this
beer
is
either
proof
of
the
common
thought
that
abws
peak
at
around
twoyearsold
or
i
just
like
it
more
than
most
people
original
flavor
with
a
killer

smooth

and

sitting
in

glass
it
has
hints
of
red
deadening
bland
taste
at
the
finish
across
the
palate
not
a
boozy
flavor
but
has
a
consistency
to
it
i
feel
this
one
would
be
better
after
being
in
the
cellar
for
a
period
not
my
favorite
barley
wine
this
beer
is
an
opaque
brown
color
with
a
solid
head
on
it
the
lacing
is
very
nice
too
the
problem
i
have
with
this
is
the
mixture
of
sweetness
and
spice
its
not
very
well
balanced
i
had
a
difficult
time
even
drinking
the
6oz
sampler
i
had
i
dont
plan
on
having
this
one
again
anytime
soon
overall
the
beer
smelled
good
but
it
was
not
as
good
as
was
hoping
for
below
average
barleywine
but
not
horrible
that
being
said
i
could
not
finish
my
glass
of
this
beer
fuller
syrupy
body
lower
carbonation
sticky
and
chewy
eh
this
really
isnt
what
i
would
call
exciting
or
something
id
buy
again
overall
a
little
boozy
and
sweet
for
me
although
i
still
managed
to
finish
my
glass
i
dont
recommend
to
many
of
these
if
you
need
to
get
behind
the
wheel
this
beer
packs
a
punch
d
this
is
a
nice
barleywine
but
not
a
great
one
the
age
smoothed
it
out
quite
nicely
d
i
will
not
drink
this
again
really
wasnt
impressed
it
drinks
ok
but
i
am
glad
i
shared
the
bottle
i
felt
the
carbonation
was
too
much
d
definitely
a
sipper
warming
alcohol
is
prominent
overall
drinkability
is
very
good
no
alcohol
burn
or
bite
good
carbonation
level
no
carbonic
bite
not
sure
why
there
is
no
love
for
this
beer
d
a
sipper
with
plenty
of
alcohol
bite
a
decent
barleywine
that
is
lacking
to
be
great
color
was
somewhat
light
and
cloudy
with
a
minimal
head
aroma
had
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
as
said
earlier
i
felt
the
flavor
was
a
little
on
the
hot
side
but
otherwise
as
a
barleywine
should
taste
d
drinkable
but
not
something
to
write
home
about
it
just
was
not
a
good
brew
md
full
bodied
relatively
smooth
with
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
from
an
i
can
drink
it
stand
point
but
not
from
a
i
want
to
drink
it
stance
i
wouldnt
pour
this
down
the
drain
but
overall
its
just
a
plain
beer
on
tap
at
cambridge
common
and
has
the
honor
of
being
the
first
dud
ive
ever
had
there
this
is
the
most
unbarleywine
barleywine
ive
tasted
no
depth
of
flavor
or
aroma
no
complexity
not
even
an
interesting
color
very
light
tone
body
and
flavor
none
of
the
intensity
youd
expect
in
a
barleywine
its
as
if
it
visited
the
shrink
before
leaving
the
tap
and
had
all
the
mystery
reasoned
away
from
it
letting
it
warm
up
for
about
half
an
hour
didnt
even
bring
out
much
flavor
blech
d
really
struggled
to
finish
the
glass
im
going
to
give
the
other
bottle
i
bought
a
few
years
to
age
d
easy
to
drink
nothing
too
offensive
while
not
the
best
barleywine
our
there
it
certainly
is
more
drinkable
than
some
of
the
reviews
would
have
you
believe
the
alstroms
should
give
this
another
shot
as
i
dont
beleive
it
warrants

over

ran
out
of
beer
tonight
and
this
was
the
only
left
that
we
thought
had
aged
long
enough
overall
a
great
beer
the
smell
and
taste
are
far
from
each
other
when
i
first
opened
it
i
thought
it
would
be
overly
sweet

instead
its

hoppy
malty
and
incredibly
smooth

glad
i
kept
one

notes
to
self2013
vintage
in

2014
from
a
growler
very
good
beer
hoppy
but
not
as
much
so
as
some
barley
wines
such
as
alaskan
and
bigfoot
solid
malty
base
not
too
boozy
i
would
not
pay
the
ceramic

price
but
2
pints
for
8
is
fair
onot
mind
blowing
but
pretty
good
certainly
an
interesting
beer
buy
a
bottle
not
a
growler
i
saw
this
beer
a
few
weeks
ago
and
became
curious
ive
had
many
of
rogues
beers
before
theyve
been
hit
or
miss
i
got
the
barleywine
due
to
i
had
an
imperial
a
few
days
prior
i
found
the
rogue
to
have
a
good
weight
to
it
though
i
thought
it
would
be
a
tad
heavier
the
taste
was
spot
on
with
vanilla
and
coco
notes
the
only
reason
i
did
not
give
this
a
5
rating
was
the
price

a
highly

offering
overall
i
first
reviewed
the
12
old
crusty
about
5
months
ago
and
i
gave
it
an
absolute
shit
review
i
greatly
preferred
the
14
on
tap
and
i
still
do
that
said
this
bottle
that
i
reviewed
was
literally
the
bottle
right
next
to
the
last
one
and
it
was
infinitely
better
the
previous
bottle
showed
stupid
amounts
of
metallic
character
that
was
hard
to
ignore
this
one
had
very
little
just
goes
to
show
the
volatile
difference
that
can
happen
from
bottle
to
bottle
whether
or
not
id
be
willing
to
gamble
on
another
bottle
of
this
vintage
probably
not
served
ontap
in
downtown
janesville
wi
this
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
slight
head
the
aroma
is
slight
malty
and
sweet
the
taste
is
sweet
and
boozy
great
taste
of
caramel
malts
and
smooth
finish
rather
filling
beer
and
a
nice
find
to
try
ontap
very
nicely
made
overall
i
bought
this
one
mostly
for
the
sweet
swingtop
ceramic
bottle
i
found
the
beer
to
be
a
bit
over
priced
and
but
just
not
doing
it
for
me
the
flavors
are
to
untamed
and
harsh
overall
have
been
disappointed
with
many
rogue
offerings
but
not
this
one
well
done
overall
pretty
nice
barleywine
could
use
a
bit
more
sweetness
but
im
happy
lacks
some
of
the
edge
of
a
fresh
bottle
but
the
age
has
bound
together
the
disparate
flavors
into
a
perfectly
harmonious
whole
excellent
beer
for
a
rainy
day
wish
id
cellared
some
more
i
think
this
could
easily
cellar
for
a
few
more
years
without
falling
off
too
much
o
i
am
not
a
big
barleywine
guy
and
a
little
goes
a
long
way
with
me
but
this
really
was
a
dessert
beer
i
dont
like
overly
sweet
beers
so
the
wallop
of
hop
bitterness
kept
it
from
being
too
sweet
for
me
but
i
doubt
i
would
ever
want
more
than
10
ounces
at
once
overall
really
surprised
at
the
hop
punch
with
this
beer
even
after
sitting
for
4
years
a
decent
brew
that
seems
like
it
would
have
held
up
for
a
few
more
years
wish
i
had
a
few
more
tucked
away
overall
just
a
great
barleywine
o
very
good
barleywine
i
was
happy
with
this
rogue
offering
especially
since
it
was
my
first
of
theirs
since
i
ventured
into
voodoo
doughnut
territory
got
a
two
litre
growler
of
this
from
cellarbrations
carlisle
its
been
a
while
since
i
sampled
this
and
pours
a
rusty
copper
hue
with
an
off
white
two
finger
creamed
head
and
clingy
leggy
boozy
lacing
nicethe
nose
is
butterscotchmarzipantoffeea
touch
of
booze
and
a
distinct
herbal
hoppiness
and
yeah
its
a
barley
wine
alright
with
a
nice
full
well
carbonated
feel
and
the
taste
starts
sweet
with
caramel
maltsbutterscotchmaple
syrup
and
toffee
finished
with
a
fruitcake
bittersweetness
and
overall
well
worth
the
price
compared
to
buying
it
in
bottle
and
well
worth
a
try
cheers
a
quite
bitter
barleywine
with
discordant
flavors
that
have
not
melded
well
even
3
years
after
bottling
and
aged
in
appropriate
conditions
i
like
smelling
it
i
dont
like
drinking
it
as
much
gentlemen
your
99
is
an
understatement
rogue
has
set
the
bar
very
high
for
a
cellarable
ale
decent
but
i
wouldnt
want
any
more
than
my
4
ounce
pour
f
o
for
a
16
year
old
barleywine
i
dont
see
it
faring
any
better
short
of
the
mineral
water
bitterness
this
was
a
really
impressive
science
experiment
in
aging
me
thinks
the
absurd
ibu
level
does
not
help
after
all
of
the
hop
flavors
have
faded
away
o
exceptional
beer
this
would
be
a
wonderful
beer
to
age
if
you
find
this
get
it
o
overall
a
good
beer
but
it
seemed
to
be
lacking
in
terms
of
others
ive
had
in
the
style
it
smelled
better
than
it
tasted
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
rich
and
pleasant
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
i
like
it
served
from
a
7
ounce
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
very
little
foam
the
aroma
is
strong
with
candy
sugar
and
laced
with
dark
fruit
overtones
smooth
and
slightly
carbonated
on
the
palate
it
starts
sweet
offering
a
few
tobacco
notes
as
it
glides
back
bitterness
rises
at
the
end
to
finish
it
off
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
would
appreciate
more
depth
perhaps
more
age
for
barleywine
overall
pretty
good
that
said
i
really
enjoyed
this
great
beer
an
old
standard
probably
a
good
starting
place
for
those
new
to
the
style
yet
another
reminder
of
why
i
prefer
a
good
english
barleywine
though
very
nice
beer
here
theres
no
doubt
that
this
is
a
sipper
the
flavors
are
very
strong
yet
blend
together
very
well
o
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
very
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
but
there
are
better
beers
in
the
style
drank
2012
in
a
beer
snifter
i
was
given
a
bottle
from
1998
that
an
uncle
had
cellared
i
cracked
it
open
on
a
damp
cool
september
night
i
enjoyed
it
but
wasnt
blown
away
im
thinking
it
might
have
been
slightly
past
its
prime
14
years
is
quite
a
long
time
i
know
but
it
was
enjoyable
the
alcohol
had
all
but
vanished
but
there
was
some
subtle
bitterness
that
felt
out
of
place
it
was
definitely
better
when
it
was
closed
cold
then
after
i
had
let
it
sit
the
warmer
it
got
the
worse
i
felt
it
got
i
have
another
bottle
that
was
cellared
in
2010
so
i
think
ill
try
that
shortly
and
compare
the
two
i
have
no
doubt
about
its
legendary
status
but
for
me
this
wasnt
spectacular
just
merely
good
o
crustacean
is
a
powerful
barleywine
that
is
smooth
but
does
pack
a
powerful
punch
good
enjoyable
flavor
overall
quite
a
good
and
very
different
from
most
barleywines
nice
to
grab
this
one
for
a
change
o
i
would
have
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
search
very
hard
for
it
nonetheless
a
very
decent
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
toffee
citrus
fruit
and
citrus
zest
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
sweet
flavor
and
an
herbal
hop
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
with
some
nice
aromas
and
flavors
o
this
beer
is
huge
on
the
sweetness
bready
malts
and
the
bitterness
is
there
but
not
truly
pronounced
i
think
this
has
faded
somewhat
but
is
still
good
regardless
the
flavors
really
playoff
each
other
a
develop
a
complex
and
balanced
beer
bottled
in
2010
i
can
tell
that
the
hops
have
faded
quite
a
bit
i
was
expecting
to
have
a
big
robust
hop
palate
but
i
will
have
to
find
a
fresh
bottle
to
get
the
real
flare
of
this
beast
that
being
said
it
has
aged
very
well
o
this
one
is
tasty
and
i
went
into
it
with
no
expectations
there
are
barleywines
i
prefer
to
this
one
but
i
would
drink
this
again
7oz
bottled
in
2000
sampled
in
2012
so
its
got
a
bit
of
age
on
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
the
aroma
is
filled
with
caramel
dark
sugar
and
lots
of
dark
fruit
with
some
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
wet
cardboard
the
flavor
is
dark
sugars
and
cherries
and
raisins
with
a
healthy
dose
of
warming
alcohol
theres
an
earthy
herbal
component
in
there
as
well
medium
to
thin
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
harsh
alcohol
type
mouthfeel
its
nice
to
be
able
to
try
a
12
year
old
bottle
of
barleywine
ive
had
fresher
bottles
of
this
and
felt
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
too
present
and
this
proves
that
age
wont
fix
that
the
twist
off
cap
probably
didnt
help
much
but
there
was
still
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
nice
to
try
i
so
wish
it
tasted
like
it
smelled
but
nope
its
kind
of
bland
actually
its
sweet
but
not
as
sweet
as
it
smells
its
like
an
overly
dry
almost
off
tasting
sweetness
that
turns
me
off
i
think
it
may
have
oxidized
i
think
i
want
dry
sweetness
but
i
get
some
dryness
but
the
grains
feel
dry
and
they
dont
work
with
the
sweeter
notes
at
all
overall
big
and
potent
with
a
heavy
boozy
flavor
and
a
wonderful
thickness
overall
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
for
me
some
things
i
like
some
things
are
off
some
things
i
hate
its
not
an
amateurish
or
badly
made
beer
its
just
badly
designed
in
my
opinion
it
doesnt
really
work
as
a
whole
i
almost
feel
guilty
giving
it
such
a
low
score
but
i
expect
a
retaste
in
the
future
to
correct
or
confirm
my
suspicions
o
love
love
love
this
big
ass
barleywine
total
worth
the
money
great
flavor
and
huge
amount
of
alcohol
overall
not
great
but
not
bad
either
the
look
and
smell
are
great
but
the
taste
and
the
feel
are
only
slightly
above
average
all
of
this
adds
up
to
a
good
beer
but
it
probably
isnt
worth
paying
17
99
for
a
bomber
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
had
stayed
away
from
rogue
for
a
while
but
this
is
a
great
beer
very
flavorful
and
well
crafted
great
job
rogue
overall
this
was
a
pleasant
brew
strong
but
never
overbearing
or
not
tasty
this
would
pair
with
a
solid
dinner
like
roasted
pork
loin
and
smashed
potatoes
overall
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
it
was
balanced
very
well
the
alcohol
was
noticeable
but
not
overbearing
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
a
hoppy
surprise
in
every
bottle
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
decent
head
and
lacing
but
soon
dissipates
the
smell
has
definite
notes
of
malt
and
a
bit
of
fruity
notes
the
beer
tastes
awesome
you
can
taste
the
hops
but
it
is
smoothed
out
with
the
malt
and
the
subtle
sweetness
of
the
fruit
you
can
definitely
taste
the
higher
alcohol
content
but
it
doesnt
take
away
from
the
beer
the
smoothness
mixed
with
light
carbonation
makes
for
a
great
mouthfeel
overall
this
was
a
really
well
done
barley
wine
p
s
11
5
abv
where
very
well
hidden
there
are
better
barleywines
out
there
these
days
but
this
is
still
an
impressive
well
made
very
well
crafted
beer
from
the
folks
at
rogue
definitely
a
walk
down
memory
lane
with
this
one
overall
this
was
probably
the
least
good
beer
of
the
flight
there
seems
to
be
a
weird
amalgamation
of
flavors
here
almost
like
rather
than
a
wellintegrated
barleywine
its
a
mixture
of
scotch
ale
and
dipa
o
a
very
good
beer
surprisingly
hoppy
recommended
o
really
great
rogue
beer
one
of
the
best
and
a
steal
at
under
2
a
bottle
highly
recommended
a
stellar
example
of
the
american
barleywine
style
i
have
no
idea
what
its
like
fresh
but
this
aged
bottle
is
a
thing
of
beauty
would
have
again
it
is
amazing
getting
to
drink
a
beer
with
this
kind
of
history
my
hat
is
off
to
this
restaurant
for
stocking
this
bit
of
history
and
to
rogue
for
making
a
barleywine
that
keeps
so
well
overall
this
is
a
solid
west
coast
hoppy
barley
wine
very
big
feeling
beer
and
great
after
dinner
on
a
rainy
cold
night
recommended
ill
still
get
more
bottles
of
this
and
give
them
a
couple
of
more
years
to
mellow
i
wouldnt
approach
the
2010
vintage
until
at
least
2014
o
complex
and
drinkable
a
very
good
barleywine
o
fantastic
but
i
think
the
best
is
yet
to
come
glad
i
still
have
a
bottle
in
the
cellar
do
a
definite
sipper
so
bitter
though
its
tough
to
get
through
7oz
probably
the
most
bitter
intensely
hopped
barleywine
ive
had
except
for
fresh
bigfoot
maybe
pours
a
hazy
deep
amber
to
brownish
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
fruity
and
a
small
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
dark
fruits
with
a
pleasant
alcohol
burn
all
the
way
through
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
presence
in
the
aftertaste
does
not
seem
huge
in
alcohol
quite
smooth
and
mellow
gnarly
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
amber
color
and
looks
thick
and
sticky
like
the
texture
of
marshmallow
fluff
smells
mildly
hoppy
and
just
super
strong
was
told
by
the
barkeep
it
was
121
ibus
which
would
make
this
the
most
bitter
beer
i
have
ever
consumed
but
it
didnt
feel
bitter
or
certainly
not
121
units
bitter
did
little
to
mask
the
alcohol
in
any
event
this
was
just
brimming
with
boozey
punch
a
pint
of
this
could
kill
a
casual
beer
drinker
overall
just
a
huge
beer
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
and
even
gnarly
for
a
barleywine
which
tend
to
be
burley
to
begin
with
cool
to
try
around
the
holidays
for
sure
cheers
i
am
guessing
that
this
beer
would
be
well
above
an
a
average
if
rogue
sold
vintages
like
j
w
lees
harvest
ale
i
cant
speak
from
experience
but
this
has
masterpiece
at
5

and
the
two
years
that
were
supposedly
on
this
keg
improved
it
vastly
both
the
hops
and
alcohol
have
mellowed
significantly
and
the
malt
character
has
become
darker
and
more
complex
there
is
still
enough
of
the
resinous
hops
and
sharp
alcohol
left
to
keep
the
beer
intense
and
lend
it
a
boozy
quality

this
beer
to
have
a

lighter

but
it
presents
with
more
of
a
caramel
amber
color
decent
carbonation
for
a
barleywine
so
for
the
smell
its
malt
dominated
with
at
least
3
or
4
of
the
best
smelling
types
of
malted
barley
almost
triple
like
in
smell
but
a
little
more

the
taste
is

even
changes
for

the
beer
is

strong

presence
with
a
fair

of

the

i
would
expect
from
the
west
coast
but
i
feel
like
this
balance
really
works
does
have
a
slight
alcohol
taste
to
it
but
not
overwhelming
very
malty
taste
to
it
seems
like
licorice
really
comes
through
fullbodied
with
an
excellent
bite
to
it
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
this
beer
defines
extreme
beer
love
or
it
hate
it
it
is
not
for
everyone
great
extremely
drinkable
beer
very
hoppy
but
with
a
great
floral
quality
and
light
caramel
flavor
highly
recommended
overall
this
beer
is
big
and
brawny
tongue
ripping
and
face
numbing
everything
i
ever
dreamed
it
would
be
although
15
bucks
for
26
ounces
of
beer
is
whackadoo
wish
they
would
ditch
the
fancy
ceramics
and
give
us
some
cheaper
packaging
its
the
recession
yall
d
this
was
pretty
good
id
like
to
see
how
it
would
taste
after
a
couple
years
maybe
the
hops
would
mellow
out
overall
this
is
one
tasty
barleywine
worth
a
shot
notes
really
tasty
strong
but
not
overpoweringly
so
a
nice
sipping
beer
d
this
is
a
well
made
drinkable
beer
but
not
one
i
could
sit
down
and
drink
a
whole
lot
of
still
a
solid
brew
overall
a
very
special
treat
indeed
as
i
said
above
it
held
up
better
than
i
thought
it
would
the
aroma
was
heavenly
and
stood
out
more
than
anything
my
only
complaint
was
that
i
was
hoping
for
a
thicker
consistency
one
that
would
compliment
the
taste
other
than
that
this
was
definitely
worthy
of
my
100th
review
an
intensely
malty
flavor
at
the
beginning
of
the
mouth
feel
followed
by
a
sweet
aftertaste
typical
of
a
barley
wine
style
definitely
enjoy
the
bitterness
and
alcohol
content
while
the
complex
woodsy
smell
enveloped
my
palate
i
bought
this
on
tap
at
the
stone
brewery
edit
tasted
the
03
and
04
in
a
sidebysde
recently
and
was
impressed
with
the
way
this
one
had
ages
the
abrasive
hops
and
alcohol
had
calmed
a
good
bit
and
really
rounded
this
one
into
a
fine
barleywine
score
reflects
this
updated
view
as
it
is
right
now
this
is
a
great
barleywine
but
in
a
couplethree
years
it
will
be
great
ill
lay
one
of
these
down
for
the
ages

ounce
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
looks
reddish
when
held
up
to
the
light
i
can
smell
hops
as
soon
as
i
cracked
the
cap
pretty
impressive
considering
the
age
of
the
bottle
caramel
malt
takes
over
in
the
aroma
from
there
there
is
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
on
the
thicker
side
the
flavor
is
full
lots
and
lots
of
malt
and
an
impressive
hop
presence
alcohol
is
definitely
present
giving
a
peppery
taste
and
a
noticeable
warming
outstanding
overall
a
very
hoppy
barley
guy
one
which
would
surely
benefit
from
aging
but
perfect
in
its
own
way
asis
d
goes
down
easy
enough
very
warming
on
a
cold
night
smooth
finish
that
keeps
you
wanting
another
sip
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
likes
barleywines
pours
a
hazy
mahogany
with
ho
head
aroma
is
nice
and
hoppy
with
caramel
and
some
malt
i
really
like
the
taste
sweet
up
front
smooth
and
malty
then
turns
to
a
strong
hop
bitterness
mroe
pepper
and
resin
than
citrus
the
finish
is
more
hops
with
caramel
and
toffee
the
alcohol
is
hidden
throughout
but
it
creeps
up
in
the
end
this
is
a
sippin
brew
one
that
ill
surely
partake
in
again
someday
its
not
a
brew
for
the
meek
you
need
to
have
an
openmind
before
trying
this
beer
it
can
be
overwhelming
but
i
think
thats
part
of
its
luster
not
something
for
everyone
but
id
drink
it
again
despite
to
hefty
price
it
is
of
course
not
something
ill
be
drinking
one
after
the
other
in
the
garage
while
im
putting
brakes
on
the
jeep
its
not
meant
to
be
but
its
a
nice
diversion
a
beer
experience
im
glad
i
had
and
will
likely
have
again
this
time
im
going
to
buy
one
a
store
it
for
10
years
i
wonder
what
alchemy
will
happen
in
that
time
i
should
also
point
out
this
retailing
for
around
3540au
in
australia
definently
worth
it
for
something
incredibly
unique
d
this
is
an
outstanding
american
barleywine
and
the
beer
i
think
rogue
really
shines
in
a
must
try
overall
not
on
my
favorite
list
but
worth
a
try
and
a
pretty
darn
good
brew
from
rogue
2005
vintage
consumed
51106
pour
out
very
dark
out
of
a
very
dark
ceramic
bottle
mmmm
this
is
going
to
be
good
the
aroma
was
assertive
with
roasted
malt
chocolate
malts
citrus
hops
and
as
the
temperature
rose
so
did
the
alcohol
aroma
very
inviting
aroma
the
taste
is
both
hop
flavor
and
chocolate
malt
competing
for
dominance
i
think
it
is
very
well
balanced
throughout
the
flavor
profile
near
the
end
of
the
taste
moments
before
the
next
is
to
begin
i
get
both
lingering
bittering
hops
roasted
chocolate
malts
and
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
i
love
the
taste
scratching
me
right
where
i
itch
d
this
is
one
i
wanted
to
wait
longer
to
crack
open
but
since
i
hadnt
tried
it
i
should
open
one
before
aging
the
rest
glad
i
did
one
entire
bottle
was
enough
but
i
wouldnt
have
minded
another
glass
check
this
one
out
if
you
havnt
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
it
becomes
in
a
few
years
drinkability
this
one
has
its
pros
and
cons
on
the
plus
side
its
pretty
tasty
the
alcohols
well
hidden
the
lacing
is
great
and
the
carbonation
spot
on
on
the
down
side
its
sort
of
one
dimensional
on
the
hop
side
the
alcohol
is
crazy
high
the
colors
not
so
hot
and
its
thick
as
a
bitch
overall
though
its
a
good
beer
and
one
i
would
definitely
recommend
on
tap
and
perhaps
slightly
less
so
in
bottleform
just
because
of
its
crazy
expensive
price
this
beer
was
aged
11
years
and
is
by
far
the
oldest
beer
i
have
ever
tried
i
really
like
what
aging
can
do
and
plan
on
sitting
some
barleywines
down
for
the
future
i
was
a
little
putoff
by
the
appearance
of
this
beer
but
it
had
some
other
positive
attributes
that
allayed
my
initial
fears
it
poured
viscous
and
hazy
looked
like
malt
syrup
or
maybe
eggnog
if
the
primary
ingredient
was
actually
malt
syrup
instead
of
egg
i
thought
i
was
in
for
a
malt
bomb
with
lots
of
malted
milk
ball
flavor
but
that
wasnt
the
case
aroma
was
fruity
bourbon
and
lots
of
maltiness
still
thinking
that
i
was
getting
a
malted
milk
ball
however
flavor
was
very
mellow
while
still
being
highly
malty
and
smooth
with
some
nice
bourbon
notes
quite
good
d
had
this
one
at
the
rogue
bar
right
after
tasting
their
imperial
stout
this
would
be
another
one
that
i
could
take
my
time
with
and
not
even
think
about
switching
to
something
else
but
i
was
at
the
bar
and
i
didnt
want
to
pay
15
a
piece
to
try
at
home
complex
enjoyable
and
tasty
pours
a
mahogany
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
nose
is
well
balanced
between
the
bitter
hops
and
sweet
malts
as
is
the
flavor
this
is
exactly
where
an
american
barleywine
should
be
right
between
a
double
ipa
and
an
english
barley
fruity
hops
followed
by
rich
malts
ripe
plums
and
cherries
carmelized
candy
and
subtle
alcohols
full
body
is
well
carbonated
a
great
brew
from
rogue
maybe
i
will
buy
a
bottle
after
all
as
im
sure
this
will
age
nicely
i
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
this
again
because
of
the
price
and
uniqueness
of
the
beer
but
i
would
highly
recommend
it
to
any
hophead
searching
for
the
next
conquest
d
for
the
style
i
am
having
no
problem
tearing
up
the
750
it
might
tear
me
up
later
though
the
750ml
bottle
is
enough
for
the
night
but
by
the
next
day
i
am
ready
for
another
one
d
very
good
drinkability
and
enjoyment
and
one
that
shouldnt
be
missed
not
being
a
fan
of
barleywines
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
ale
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
for
such
a
big
beer
the
hop
bitterness
is
pretty
high
and
might
affect
drinkability
for
some
but
i
find
it
necessary
to
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
overall
no
balance
to
be
found
here
if
this
is
at
all
indicative
of
american
barleywine
style
then
ill
be
sticking
to
the
english
style
from
here
out
i
could
have
given
it
a
lower
rating

good
right

and
im
going
to
bank
on
a
whole
case
to
throw
in
my

on
the
suspicion
that
this
will
only
get
better
d
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
enjoy
the
whole
bomber
without
pissing
yourself
however
you
must
try
this
beer
and
i
think
in
about
4
years
after
some
harshness
is
gone
from
the
hop
profile
it
may
well
be
around
a
4
9
will
be
drinking
again
overall
different
offering
and
hoppy
as
hell
my
first
randalized
offering
and
i
am
ready
for
more
definitely
puts
a
new
spin
on
things
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
definitely
on
the
thick
side
carbonation
has
held
up
well
its
very
smooth
and
drinkable
probably
its
strength
limits
its
drinkability
but
its
certainly
a
pleasure
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
its
blended
well
and
certainly
not
overly
noticeable
overall
this
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
perhaps
i
should
start
cellaring
beer
i
definitely
appreciate
having
a
friend
that
does
d
this
certainly
a
sipper
and
im
glad
i
had
some
help
from
alhrabosky
with
this
one
ill
look
for
the
7oz
bottles
next
time
rather
than
the
750ml
d
nice
beer
to
sip
on
one
crock
of
this
stuff
is
all
any
beer
drinker
would
need
even
professionals
like
me
barley
wine
beers
are
my
second
favorite
beer
this
on
is
one
of
the
best
ive
tasted
high
on
alcohol
but
really
good
overall
this
brew
is
a
beauty
from
head
to
toe
ill
be
sad
when
the
cask
is
done
thought
that
might
take
a
while
still
has
maintained
its
hops
how
the
hell
can
this
be
as
hoppy
as
it
is
its
more
hoppy
than
any
fresh
barleywine
ive
had
carbonation
has
decreased
and
is
much
smoother
just
cant
believe
how
hoppy
this
is
again
for
the
price
it
was
great
because
i
never
wanted
to
spend
the
fifteen
dollars
on
it
before
suprised
to
see
on
tap
here
not
bad
for
a
barleywine
and
i
would
recommend
to
any
fans
of
rogue
that
are
curious
overall
an
interesting
barleywine
but
not
nearly
ready
to
drink
i
thought
two
years
may
have
been
enough
for
this
one
to
be
drinkable
but
now
i
think
it
could
have
used
another
eight
its
still
a
train
wreck
of
flavors
and
needs
to
round
out
quite
a
bit
more
not
bad
just
not
ready
a
little
pricey
due
to
the
gimmicky
bottle
but
worth
it
if
you
have
the
patience
id
buy
it
again
but
not
until
i
have
a
proper
cellar
to
hold
something
as
long
as
this
needs
to
be
held
the
taste
is
extremely
bitter
lots
of
grapefruit
and
citric
hops
that
stings
at
the
back
of
the
throat
nice
malty
taste
and
a
warming
alcohol
i
cant
wait
to
age
a
bottle
for
a
couple
of
years
but
i
did
not
enjoy
it
as
much
as
i
thought
i
would
d
so
strong
so
intense
so
raw
and
gritty
yet
so
sophisticated
and
refined
a
brew
this
exceptional
should
be
saved
for
special
occasions
im
giving
a
3
5
because
it
should
not
be
consumed
easily
or
massively
it
should
be
an
xsperience
wow
this
is
an
awesome
american
barleywine
delicious
aggressive
rich
wellbalanced
for
style
a
work
of
brewing
art
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
american
barleywines
ive
had
highly
recommended
served
at
the
old
toad
it
poured
a
murky
brown
very
little
head
looks
like
the
water
at
the
bottom
of
a
lake
if
you
stir
it
around
with
your
foot
it
smells
nutty
piny
and
boozy
the
taste
is
complex
but
i
think
it
has
too
much
of
a
boozy
affect
it
starts
out
clean
and
malty
then
snaps
back
with
a
raw
hop
bite
as
soon
as
the
hops
start
to
regress
the
alcohol
rolls
in
for
a
dry
and
slightly
chemical
finish
a
very
warming
drink
as
the
autumn
starts
to
roll
in
drinkability
a
very
good
barley
wine
lots
of
hops
overall
balanced
really
nicely
would
buy
it
again
for
sure
d
not
to
good
i
think
with
a
nice
smooth
carbonation
it
would
of
been
quite
a
bit
better
just
really
strong
and
hot
flavors
i
would
like
to
try
one
with
about
5
years
of
age
instead
of
10
drinkability
i
am
glad
i
have
another
of
these
aging
notes
this
is
a
beer
that
needs
a
lot
of
time
and
then
some
more
time
the
crazy
bitterness
of
this
one
made
my
head
spin
and
i
would
hope
that
a
few
years
would
smooth
that
out
a
bit
anyway
there
is
a
great
gem
of
a
beer
hidden
away
somewhere
in
there
you
just
have
to
dig
to
find
it
this
brew
was
a
nice
hop
treat
i
let
it
warm
up
a
little
then
the
flavors
really
poured
out
the
dark
amber
smelled
like
a
hop
explosion
piney
resinous
and
thick
alcohol
was
noticeable
but
not
overwhelming
flavors
were
dominated
by
hops
oily
goodness
coming
in
waves
malts
played
second
slightly
sweet
roasted
and
complex
there
was
a
bittersweet
medicinal
taste
in
the
pair
and
combined
it
was
delicious
squeaky
clean
finish
i
would
put
it
up
against
rogues
imperial
ipa
as
a
hop
dream
any
day
dont
drink
and
review
md
with
an
oily
and
syrupyrich
palate
sparkled
by
microscopic
fizziness
this
is
an
absolutely
120bodied
barley
wine
benefiting
from
a
liveliness
unlike
any
5yearold
strong
ale
as
it
breathes
the
alc
edge
considerably
softens
or
maybe
because
my
tongue
and
throat
have
got
used
to
it
allowing
for
a
more
colourful
display
of
hops
and
malts
i
cant
imagine
how
it
might
have
tasted
when
it
was
younger
while
i
take
it
that
theres
still
plenty
of
room
for
it
to
mature
maybe
for
another
five
years
recommended
for
patient
small
sipping
better
shared
in
small
quantities
as
a
digestif
i
have
had
this
beer
long
ago
and
have
even
heard
recently
how
bitter
this
beer
was
but
i
was
still
a
bit
surprised
by
how
tongue
scrapingly
hoppy
the
bitterness
of
this
beer
is
even
in
this
obviously
aged
sample
it
still
dominates
the
finish
with
an
unwavering
grip
with
the
lightish
body
and
without
the
dark
color
this
would
almost
pass
for
a
modern
day
double
ipa
though
it
might
perhaps
be
a
mediocre
example
i
will
have
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
soon
to
see
what
that
is
like
d
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
mouth
is
medium
and
it
feels
nice
id
rate
this
higher
for
drinkability
if
there
were
the
choice
of
buying
this
in
a
regular
bottle
or
the
ceramic
but
since
there
really
isnt
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
unless
i
find
these
old
vintages
poured
into
a
16oz
glass
beer
was
dark
brown
with
a
red
hue
and
about
an
inch
of
head
very
creamy
with
good
carbonation
and
moderate
lacing
smell
had
distinct
grain
odor
with
a
hint
of
cherry
but
without
an
overpowering
alcohol
smell
the
taste
is
very
bitter
and
the
high
abv
comes
through
strong
initially
masking
the
complexity
you
can
definitely
taste
the
grain
and
the
the
hops
also
leaves
quite
a
lasting
bitter
aftertaste
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
heavy
with
a
residual
that
i
can
bite
as
if
unfiltered
to
the
bottle
the
is
a
great
novelty
beer
but
you
arent
going
to
be
drinking
a
lot
of
it
at
any
given
sitting
i
must
point
out
that
the
bottle
it
comes
in
is
worth
trying
this
beer
2003
vintage
aggressive
pour
yields
a
huge
2
head
creamy
dark
beige
body
is
a
cloudy
thick
looking
brown
good
head
retention
smell
is
all
malty
sweet
molassas
taste
is
quite
surprising
yeah
the
malts
are
there
but
putting
up
one
hell
of
a
fight
are
the
hops
can
you
believe
that
shit
4
years
old
and
the
hop
presence
is
still
all
over
this
bad
boy
mouthfeel
is
fine
smooth
little
to
no
carbonation
in
the
body
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
but
theres
no
doubt
it
is
lurking
aboot
bittersweet
and
strong
this
on
is
a
sipper
750ml
painted
ceramic
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
aroma
is
dominated
with
dark
fruits
malt
caramel
and
alcohol
the
taste
starts
off
pretty
mellow
but
the
hops
quickly
kick
in
and
give
you
a
nice
smack
in
the
face
there
is
a
lingering
bitterness
of
the
hops
in
the
finish
to
accompany
the
expected
warming
from
the
11
alcohol
overall
old
crusty
is
a
wonderful
barley
wine
i
look
forward
to
having
one
after
it
ages
for
a
while
as
well
recommended
poured
in
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
scant
18
tan
head
over
the
barely
translucent
reddish
brown
brew
head
is
gone
in
a
flash
down
to
swirl
and
tiny
rim
bubbles
with
delicate
but
lasting
lacing
aroma
is
heavy
sweetness
and
musty
alcohol
taste
starts
with
earthy
grains
quickly
switching
to
alcohol
which
almost
seems
to
evaporate
off
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
excellent
for
this
style
and
age
and
drinkability
pretty
nice
as
well
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
with
this
much
age
under
its
cap
drinkability
this
is
very
good
high
abv
holds
down
sessionability
lucky
to
try
this
from
the
puny
bottle
my
buddy
jim
dug
out
of
his
cellar
looks
the
same
and
smells
the
same
as
my
previous
review
flat
very
oxidized
think
drinking
sherry
out
of
a
cardboard
box
sweet
ancient
more
academic
than
anything
else
im
afraid
its
past
the
prime
of
life
still
a
fine
example
of
an
aged
beer
this
beer
is
a
monster
i
would
like
to
taste
this
after
it
has
been
cellared
for
a
few
years
so
it
has
a
chance
to
mature
this
may
the
most
leafy
beer
i
have
ever
had
although
my
tongue
is
already
numb
i
can
see
the
potential
greatness
in
this
brew
at
this
time
however
this
beer
to
green
and
aggressive
to
get
the
top
scores
it
will
get
when
it
has
a
chance
to
mellow
an
enjoyable
sipper
for
those
who
like
the
hops
not
an
everyday
beer
but
a
nice
treat
the
mouthfeel
comes
off
as
a
little
thin
and
at
times
a
little
overcarbonated
but
this
is
still
a
very
nice
barleywine
and
well
worth
the
high
price
i
look
forward
to
this
years
incarnation
taste
is
a
bit
odd
for
me
mostly
nutty
and
raisin
some
dark
fruit
perhaps
plum
but
very
discrete
the
feel
is
a
bit
buttery
or
creamy
not
my
cup
of
tea
yet
it
is
still
good
i
prefer
some
other
bws
to
this
what
a
beer
this
becomes
after
10
years
geez
louise
thanks
to
timtheenchanta
in
bif46
for
this
superb
brew
the
drinkability
for
a
barely
wine
in
particular
is
pretty
high
it
is
very
robust
though
and
of
course
super
strong
but
if
you
like
barleywines
old
crusty
goes
down
like
butter
a
fantastic
barleywine
for
my
100th
review
i
grabbed
this
one
out
of
the
fridge
the
last
old
crusty
i
had
is
still
seared
in
my
memory
as
the
most
bitter
beer
ive
ever
had
adding
a
couple
more
years
takes
more
of
the
bitterness
off
and
this
starts
to
become
a
nicely
balanced
beer
too
bad
its
so
expensive
to
purchase
these
days
since
its
a
great
beer
a
good
brutally
bitter
sipper
but
not
very
sesionable
another
barleywine
for
the
hop
heads
and
i
may
have
found
this
more
drinkable
at
the
start
of
our
session
as
opposed
to
the
end
may
try
this
one
again
but
i
wont
be
looking
for
it
anytime
soon
this
beer
definitely
holds
up
well
and
probably
would
continue
to
age
for
many
years
bottle
is
really
nice
though
maybe
ill
make
a
lamp
out
of
it
this
barley
wine
is
not
for
the
weak
or
faint
of
heart
prerequisites
should
be
a
palate
trained
like
a
ninja
crossed
with
a
navy
seal
and
the
stomach
of
a
concrete
elephant
either
way
after
downing
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
on
your
own
youll
still
be
singing
that
song
about
the
goblin
as
with
all
of
rogues
extreme
ales
i
feel
as
if
they
should
be
sampled
and
experienced
at
least
once
and
then
returned
to
depending
on
ones
intestinal
fortitude
and
how
far
their
wallet
can
stretch
thick
brownred
with
a
tan
head
very
hazy
and
nice
nose
is
sweet
alcohol
good
for
the
style
taste
is
very
sweet
some
malts
lots
of
alcohol
and
a
hoppy
finish
pretty
complex
this
could
probably
use
some
cellaring
to
even
it
out
bottled
in
2004
12
oz
bottle
pours
almost
black
but
with
reddish
tints
and
caramel
highlights
minimal
head
as
would
be
expected
for
the
style
and
the
abv
the
aroma
is
a
bit
rough
it
says
i
need
more
time
in
the
bottle
rough
hop
notes
vie
with
stillcrystalline
sugary
malts
pine
graham
cracker
and
caramel
all
mix
here
on
the
tongue
very
sweet
first
off
with
nutty
malts
and
caramel
before
moving
into
malt
bitterness
gradually
through
the
midpalate
by
the
time
the
finish
rolls
around
the
hops
are
out
in
full
force
leaving
an
entrenched
earthy
bitterness
in
their
wake
mouthfeel
is
extra
thick
as
expected
with
more
carbonation
than
i
expected
as
well
well
see
how
time
affect
that
particular
element
overall
this
is
a
promising
american
barleywine
and
one
that
could
show
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
and
balance
with
aging
but
as
of
now
it
does
not
match
up
with
the
best
of
the
genre
this
is
the
most
vile
concoction
i
have
ever
had
i
poured
this
one
down
the
drain
rather
quickly
i
guess
i
just
didnt
get
the
point
the
120
ibus
were
not
counter
balanced
by
anything
making
for
a
nasty
taste
from
start
to
finish
im
not
normally
pissed
off
finding
a
beer
i
dont
like
but
dropping
serious
coin
for
this
bomber
did
the
trick
d
excellent
barleywine
would
get
this
again
for
sure
this
is
an
intriguing
brew
i
find
bigfoot
hits
a
good
spot
for
me
starting
at
6
years
old
i
think
this
would
probably
do
the
same
at
10
years
the
only
caution
i
might
have
to
putting
to
much
money
into
this
beer
in
the
cellar
is
the
carbonation
faint
as
it
is
id
hate
to
find
it
is
not
up
to
the
task
of
aging
to
what
this
beer
seems
to
be
capable
of
kudos
to
himerman
for
the
trade
and
to
all
those
aging
these
away
i
think
i
must
go
put
a
6
pack
away
for
future
years
im
afraid
this
beer
really
needs
to
age
in
order
to
mellow
and
blend
some
more
this
one
was
too
raw
drinkability
pretty
good
an
outstanding
example
of
its
style
and
one
which
ive
bought
a
lot
of
and
will
buy
a
lot
more
of
overall
a
good
beer
in
its
own
right
though
this
is
not
what
i
expected
from
a
barelywine
i
was
not
familiar
with
the
highhopped
american
style
and
believe
i
prefer
the
english
12
oz
bottle
dated
2002
this
was
the
bull
and
bush
vintage
beer
of
the
month
this
thing
had
absolutely
no
head
which
is
not
surprising
for
a
barleywine
the
color
was
a
dark
orangebrown
and
cloudy
i
couldnt
pick
up
much
smell
from
this
beer
the
taste
was
good
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
little
nutty
i
could
taste
the
hops
as
well
the
one
thing
i
didnt
like
is
the
rogue
taste
i
detect
in
all
their
beers
maybe
its
the
pacman
yeast
but
i
just
dont
like
it
the
alcohol
was
fairly
well
hidden
in
the
taste
but
i
sure
noticed
it
as
soon
as
i
was
finished
sipping
what
a
letdown
out
of
all
the
rogue
beers
i
have
tried
i
only
liked
a
2004
imperial
stout
not
something
to
drink
everynight
but
i
will
definately
find
some
more
occasions
for
it
in
summation
i
would
say
that
if
anyone
thinks
that
they
are
ready
for
a
barley
wine
they
should
start
with
this
one
it
is
a
good
alternative
to
ice
cream
for
an
afterdinner
snack
cheers
glad
i
found
this
ontap
at
cah
in
richmond
because
ive
been
wanting
to
try
it
but
was
hesitant
to
spend
14
on
a
bottle
definitely
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
be
buying
the
bottle
anytime
soon
a
very
intense
beer
that
im
sure
would
get
a
little
better
with
some
age
on
it
pours
brown
with
a
tan
head
lots
of
tiny
little
bubbles
rising
through
the
brown
body
looks
good
for
a
barleywine
smells
very
sweet
with
floral
hops
and
alcohol
taste
is
very
bitter
and
very
sweet
and
malty
some
floral
hops
flavors
along
with
a
smokiness
thats
quite
nice
bitterness
would
probably
fade
a
bit
more
with
time
but
its
good
to
go
now
as
well
i
might
age
one
just
for
fun
anyway
to
see
how
it
changes
good
to
sip
and
takes
a
while
to
get
through
the
whole
thing
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
is
gone
before
you
blink
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
sweet
smells
similar
to
many
rogue
beers
also
you
can
detect
the
alcohol
i
am
picking
up
some
fruits
maybe
some
citrus
a
very
aromatic
barleywine
do
not
gulp
this
one
it
will
knock
you
to
the
floor
this
thing
is
packed
to
the
brim
with
flavor
starts
sweet
with
the
fruit
which
quickly
turns
to
the
hops
and
bitterness
ends
with
a
soft
finish
because
the
beginning
packs
quite
a
punch
the
aftertaste
is
mostly
bitter
with
hints
of
the
citrus
the
mouthfeel
is
warming
and
smooth
goes
down
like
a
smooth
whiskey
a
great
sippin
beer
i
gave
it
a
lower
drinkability
score
because
of
its
harshness
but
do
not
let
that
scare
you
away
from
trying
this
beer
another
solid
offering
from
rogue
good
job
by
rogue
i
will
purchase
this
again
anyway
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
again
after
a
big
meal
and
im
guessing
it
would
probably
end
up
with
a
higher
score
at
that
point
ill
edit
it
if
so
warm
creamy
mouthfeel
very
satisfying
without
being
too
chewy
and
overthetop
very
nicely
balanced
and
actually
rather
palatable
all
things
considered
boy
was
i
delighted
to
find
this
one
in
not
the
new
bottles
but
in
an
old
12
ouncer
with
the
old
guy
on
the
cover
pours
a
murky
reddish
color
unlike
any
ive
seen
from
a
beer
thus
far
smell
was
of
sweet
sugar
whiskey
molasses
overly
ripe
dark
fruit
a
bit
of
chocolate
lots
of
good
stuff
no
question
about
it
this
is
one
heavilt
hopped
barleywine
the
dark
fruit
flavors
and
maple
syrup
hits
you
up
front
followed
by
the
hops
in
the
background
coating
your
tongue
ive
had
this
beer
once
before
when
it
was
young
and
i
can
definitely
say
that
this
beer
needs
some
aging
this
one
with
the
extra
year
was
a
whole
lot
better
then
the
first
one
i
tried
its
a
real
sipping
beer
if
you
happen
upon
it
give
it
a
try
im
not
a
barleywine
lover
per
se
but
im
real
glad
i
had
this
one
flavour
is
chalk
full
of
malt
that
coats
the
mouth
like
a
sweet
nectar
or
sticky
candy
a
long
lingering
resonance
is
felt
as
much
as
it
is
tasted
such
a
balance
between
hop
bitterness
and
malt
finish
same
can
be
said
for
the
balance
in
the
aroma
one
hell
of
a
beast
but
refined
and
balanced
hints
of
alcohol
can
come
and
go
but
never
disturb
the
flavour
and
if
anything
compliment
the
character
a
fantastic
barleywine
great
candidate
for
cellar
defintely
has
improved
with
age
and
one
i
keep
finding
guilty
pleasure
treating
myself
when
going
back
to
bottled
in
2002
12
oz
bottle
120
ibu
pours
a
cloudy
alomst
muddy
chestnut
color
thick
tan
foamy
head
which
held
very
well
for
the
strength
and
age
huge
candy
caramel
aroma
along
with
floral
citrusy
and
piney
hop
aroma
still
a
great
amount
of
hop
aroma
for
being
4
years
old
dark
toffee
caramel
a
bit
of
chocolate
are
the
flavors
at
first
finishes
with
some
piney
and
citrusy
hop
flavor
along
with
some
burnt
notes
the
burnt
flavor
seems
overwhelming
until
this
warms
up
even
more
still
intensely
bitter
i
cant
imagine
how
raw
this
is
fresh
very
low
carbonation
this
doesnt
seem
to
have
aged
as
well
as
i
hoped
but
it
did
improve
as
it
set
out
d
the
bang
for
the
buck
was
terrible
13
for
a
malt
bomb
that
falls
short
on
the
hop
side
d
you
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
one
very
intense
and
super
drinkable
four
years
old
at
sampling
but
still
quite
an
intense
beer
here
color
is
garnet
with
decent
head
but
little
lacing
well
blame
that
on
the
high
alcohol
content
smell
is
quintissentially
barleywine
lots
of
dark
fruit
hops
alcohol
and
sweet
malts
taste
is
very
similar
but
with
a
certain
harshness
in
the
finish
could
be
from
roasted
malt
or
perhaps
from
the
hops
120
ibus
smells
better
than
it
tastes
i
think
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
syrupy
good
carbonation
for
the
style
drinkability
isnt
great
harsh
finish
and
high
alcohol
make
this
a
special
occasion
beer
and
i
think
i
prefer
bigfoot
regardless
d
i
could
hardly
finish
a
single
glass
good
yet
average
could
be
extraordinary
with
a
few
years
of
aging
bought
the
fancy
ass
xs
series
cermaic
like
bottle
amazing
presentation
this
poured
a
deep
maroon
color
with
an
awesome
brown
colored
head
the
body
was
quite
hazy
the
nose
was
nice
but
nothing
extraordinary
i
thought
it
was
actually
kinda
mild
in
the
hop
department
this
tasted
almost
wine
like
or
a
strong
belgian
it
was
really
malty
which
is
nice
i
am
sick
of
dipa
style
barleywines
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
syrupy
this
beer
pours
out
of
a
beautiful
ceramic
bottle
included
is
a
rubber
seal
but
im
pretty
sure
that
any
ba
wont
need
to
use
it
as
they
will
finish
it
in
one
sitting
the
color
is
a
dark
complex
brown
with
layers
and
floaties
much
like
a
quad
huge
smell
although
its
hard
to
explain
the
initial
taste
is
of
alcohol
but
that
isnt
to
say
it
not
well
balanced
lots
of
hops
and
fruits
which
add
up
to
a
very
impressive
nose
there
is
a
lot
added
and
it
goes
down
almost
syruplike
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
lower
because
of
the
lingering
alcohol
taste
and
the
slightly
bitter
after
taste
overall
a
beer
to
seek
out
for
sure
just
had
some
of
this
in
the
new
ceramic
bottle
first
of
all
the
bottle
is
beautiful
a
on
the
packaging
never
being
a
big
barleywine
type
of
guy
i
was
a
little
impressed
with
how
tasty
and
more
drinkable
than
others
i
have
had
in
the
past
deep
dark
color
almost
a
little
red
there
was
no
head
and
very
little
carbonation
which
is
common
with
barleywines
however
the
taste
was
really
good
i
must
make
my
way
back
to
my
secret
spot
to
see
if
any
remain
not
only
for
me
but
also
for
holiday
giving
this
is
one
of
the
best
aging
barleywines
i
have
ever
had
d
good
strong
distinct
flavor
but
dont
drink
too
much
i
was
feeling
like
it
was
a
bit
too
much
flavor
too
handle
maybe
more
of
a
winter
brew
because
of
its
savory
quality
not
a
thirstquencher
worth
a
try
and
only
one
still
is
an
exceptional
beer
with
the
hops
still
kicking
some
ass
a
lovely
nightcap
for
a
cold
winter
night
drinkability
certainly
not
something
i
can
handle
more
than
one
bottle
of
in
one
sitting
i
do
hope
that
whoever
buys
this
in
the
big
ceramic
fliptops
shares
it
with
a
friend
or
two
because
at
11
abv
and
120
ibus
this
is
one
rude
brew
overalldrinkability
wow
just
wow
the
sophia
loren
of
graceful
agers
this
was
a
simply
sublime
drinking
experience
5
years
have
mellowed
and
deepened
the
flavors
to
an
impressive
degree
very
similar
again
to
the
great
danes
aged
barleywine
so
different
than
any
other
bottled
barlywines
out
there
its
certainly
earned
a
place
of
its
own
in
the
pantheon
of
amazing
american
beer
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
most
fantastic
beers
ive
tasted
with
truly
unique
flavors
and
the
kind
of
depth
and
development
of
flavors
desirable
in
a
barleywine
nonetheless
it
achieves
a
unique
blend
and
balance
that
makes
this
stand
out
the
hops
development
stands
out
against
other
more
onedimensional
use
of
hops
while
the
malts
are
rich
while
remaining
fruity
neither
mellow
like
old
foghorn
nor
abrasive
like
old
ruffian
old
crustacean
really
stands
on
its
own
superb
2002
vintage
12
oz
pours
a
ruby
red
to
brown
in
color
with
basically
no
head
bottle
conditioned
cloudiness
smell
is
rich
of
sweet
malts
some
pruniness
ripe
cherries
and
raspberries
perfuminess
and
a
hint
of
piney
hoppiness
that
is
enveloped
in
a
good
size
boozy
aroma
taste
is
nice
and
rich
as
well
with
good
malt
sweetness
up
front
red
licorice
caramel
and
finishing
with
a
strong
alcohol
flavor
and
warmth
the
hops
are
far
from
a
fresh
sample
of
this
one
but
are
still
present
in
the
finish
peppery
and
dry
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
slightly
thinned
from
aging
this
one
is
drinking
well
now
but
could
definitely
go
longer
in
the
cellar
to
let
more
of
the
malt
flavor
come
through
although
fresh
its
raw
power
is
also
enjoyable
750
ml
black
ceramic
bottle
with
a
swingtop
lid
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
cool
added
touch
to
the
presentation
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
about
half
full
with
the
handy
swingtop
lid
ill
be
working
on
this
bottle
for
the
rest
of
the
weekend
it
has
a
creamy
white
head
about
a
finger
width
and
recedes
to
a
solid
lace
that
last
all
the
way
to
the
end
color
is
a
fantasticly
rich
mahogany
and
clear
smell
is
sweet
like
molassas
and
caramel
malt
taste
is
very
complex
it
starts
out
very
earthy
and
malty
but
as
you
finish
the
swallow
it
ends
up
being
very
hoppy
and
bitter
there
are
also
some
coffee
notes
around
the
edges
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
in
body
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
fantastic
barley
wine
im
definately
going
to
get
more
to
cellar
damn
drinkable
and
a
damn
fine
barleywine
served
from
a
7oz
bottle
into
snifter
glasses
this
beer
was
bottled
in
1998
what
a
treat
that
i
have
been
waiting
for
the
beer
poured
a
deep
cloudy
brown
color
with
some
noticeable
sediment
throughout
the
bottle
that
made
its
way
into
the
glass
the
beer
had
a
nice
sweet
fruity
aroma
of
raisins
plums
very
similar
to
a
portlike
aroma
which
i
happen
to
enjoy
the
taste
was
had
a
sweet
fruit
malty
hit
upfront
that
was
balanced
out
slighty
by
the
present
hops
which
each
sip
from
the
snifter
the
tastes
intensified
and
the
spicey
alcohol
character
got
a
little
more
intense
worth
the
wait
and
worth
another
try
in
time
overall
i
will
buy
as
much
as
they
have
next
time
i
am
up
in
milwaukee
a
classic
imo
regardless
of
the
year
but
an
eight
year
old
batch
of
this
barleywine
is
as
heavenly
as
it
gets
in
the
american
craft
beer
world
d
pretty
good
not
the
most
balance
among
the
flavors
in
this
brew
but
still
quite
interesting
a
pretty
nice
barleywine
mouthfeel
is
very
oily
very
much
like
a
liqueur
but
the
finish
is
short
and
clean
after
warming
just
slightly
it
smooths
out
considerably
the
complexity
is
intriguing
for
this
grandaddy
of
barleywines
and
age
only
helps
this
beer
pours
a
rusty
copper
color
with
a
tan
head
that
holds
and
laces
nicely
but
eventually
fades
the
smell
is
not
overpowering
but
there
is
still
the
smells
of
dark
berry
fruits
chocholate
and
some
hops
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
with
still
a
good
amount
of
hops
hanging
around
after
all
the
aging
but
also
a
considerable
amount
of
residual
sugars
lingering
in
the
beer
the
beer
has
a
good
thickness
with
a
significant
amount
of
dryness
and
smooth
carbonation
overall
a
nice
barleywine
certainly
one
worth
picking
up
d
high
a
good
barleywine
very
easy
to
drink
ruby
complexion
with
a
slightly
green
tinted
head
or
maybe
it
was
all
the
hops
that
were
assulting
me
or
maybe
the
large
malt
waves
had
washed
out
my
mooring
wow
this
is
much
better
aged
the
hops
are
still
very
prevelant
and
the
i
feel
like
i
am
taking
a
wort
shower
the
taste
is
pretty
nice
and
complex
with
the
malt
and
a
i
must
say
there
is
a
touch
of
fusel
but
it
seems
to
be
right
you
could
eat
this
with
a
spoon
good
beer
to
relax
with
after
it
has
relaxed
overall
an
intense
barley
wine
in
my
opinion
not
quite
as
accessible
as
say
a
big
foot
but
definitely
more
extreme
thick
chewy
on
the
tongue
with
lots
of
lingering
hops
in
the
aftertaste
excellent
sipping
for
a
cool
rainy
afternoon
not
for
big
gulps
but
perfect
for
sipping
and
conversation
red
mostly
brown
color
tan
head
that
quickly
went
away
leaving
no
lacing
or
anything
behind
very
malty
backbone
caramel
and
dark
fruit
with
a
floralness
not
far
behind
very
nice
caramel
maltiness
but
the
hops
are
not
blended
enough
there
is
the
maltiness
and
then
a
very
strong
bitterness
following
pretty
good
but
i
think
needs
some
age
to
perfect
its
flavor
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
a
low
carbonation
level
took
quite
a
while
to
finish
the
glass
but
perhaps
ill
age
one
for
a
few
years
i
imagine
it
could
turn
out
quite
nicely
cheeers
ive
had
enough
barley
wine
now
to
not
be
overwhelmed
by
this
one
maybe
id
pick
up
a
3
12
ounce
every
once
in
awhile
but
i
wouldnt
bother
with
13
ceramic
bottles
notes
these
huge
barleywines
like
old
guardian
and
this
old
crustacean
are
so
incredible
with
a
few
years
of
age
on
them
drink
a
few
now
and
drink
a
few
later
for
those
folks
that
are
cellaring
this
bad
boy
and
are
wondering
when
to
drink
it
id
say
that
although
now
is
awesome
another
year
or
two
would
still
do
this
some
good
an
excellent
beer
one
to
share
on
tap
at
pizza
plant
walker
center
served
in
10ounce
goblet
deep
rubied
brown
with
dense
beigeishbrown
head
this
was
served
from
a
refrigerated
keg
and
therefore
too
cold
for
a
barleywine
but
i
was
still
able
to
pick
up
armoas
of
sweet
caramel
malts
bourbon
soaked
cherries
and
a
menacing
pine
forest
of
hops
the
huge
sweet
malty
beginnings
of
this
first
sip
are
immediately
thrashed
into
oblivion
by
the
most
massive
earthscorching
hop
bitterness
ive
ever
encountered
woody
pinestruck
acridity
lingers
infinitely
or
so
it
seems
i
dont
know
when
this
one
was
kegged
but
it
sure
as
hell
tastes
fresh
to
me
a
bubblegum
sweetness
tries
to
emerge
as
the
beer
warms
huge
chewy
mouthfeel
medium
body
my
impression
is
that
this
is
a
promising
barleywine
if
properly
aged
for
a
number
of
years
like
at
least
three
right
now
at
least
the
drinkability
has
to
be
low
because
the
hops
are
almost
too
obnoxious
to
really
enjoy
im
all
for
palate
expansion
but
beer
drinking
shouldnt
ever
feel
like
a
chore
quite
the
fine
barley
wine
this
beer
was
part
of
a
rogue
sampler
i
offered
to
some
friends
i
liked
this
better
than
they
did
it
was
a
dark
redbrown
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
some
interesting
lacing
i
could
detect
fruit
wine
and
caramel
in
the
odor
the
taste
was
all
hops
and
more
hops
with
some
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
just
a
touch
cloying
but
still
a
nice
beer
pours
a
beautiful
deep
ruby
red
with
a
larger
head
than
id
expected
given
the
style
and
abv
that
is
a
light
tan
lasts
well
and
leaves
the
most
incerdible
creamy
lacing
smell
is
big
with
port
and
rum
alcohol
apparent
and
some
currant
plum
and
spices
coming
through
with
the
fairly
light
hops
taste
is
bold
with
good
hoppiness
on
top
of
the
cherry
currant
and
plum
fruitiness
plenty
of
port
wine
grapes
and
a
touch
of
hot
alcohol
are
also
in
the
mix
tastes
are
complex
but
not
exceptionally
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
sticky
not
cloying
or
oppressive
but
promoting
a
finish
that
seems
to
go
on
forever
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
a
bit
more
balance
would
improve
it
markedly
a
great
barleywine
but
just
a
touch
too
over
the
top
to
be
truly
stupendous
might
improve
with
age
in
comparison
to
the
2002
bottled
version
this
draft
old
crusty
has
not
mellowed
nearly
as
much
i
consider
myself
a
hophead
but
this
needs
more
time
i
wonder
if
i
should
even
attempt
to
drink
one
of
the
younger
ceramic
bottles
i
think
ill
wait
d
the
drinkability
is
bad
even
for
a
barleywine
a
few
of
us
shared
the
gigantic
ceramic
fifth
my
half
glass
was
a
distressing
chore
to
finish
it
might
improve
with
age
i
will
pass
in
the
future
unless
some
tells
me
it
was
well
aged
sessions
unthinkable
food
might
be
okay
if
the
beer
was
this
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
with
a
huge
tan
foamy
head
the
smell
is
very
strong
and
very
good
the
armo
has
alot
of
fruitraisins
prunesor
grapes
and
a
fair
amount
hops
the
bottle
says
this
is
a
2003
vintageso
i
lucked
out
the
taste
has
a
creaminess
to
it
that
lessons
the
high
alcohol
content
you
can
still
feel
the
alcoholbut
the
fruit
and
hops
have
more
of
a
presence
the
mf
is
heavy
and
the
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
too
many
barleywines
have
too
much
of
a
dark
fruit
flavor
that
there
almost
like
brandybut
rogue
does
it
right
with
a
good
mix
of
fruit
and
hops
the
high
abv
and
strength
of
flavor
demands
attention
when
drinking
this
beer
the
very
antitheses
of
a
session
beer
drink
and
enjoy
slowly
and
in
moderation
overall
a
great
experience
recommend
anyone
in
the
toronto
area
who
is
a
fan
of
this
beer
head
to
beerbistro
they
have
4
different
vintages
of
old
crustacean
in
the
cellar
1997
98
2001
2002
i
believe
and
it
would
be
really
cool
to
see
how
it
ages
over
time
although
at
12
cdn
a
pop
it
better
be
a
special
occasion
i
dont
have
a
huge
americal
barley
wine
or
even
a
big
barley
wine
background
for
comparison
but
this
is
some
interesting
stuff
im
not
huge
on
the
style
but
this
is
an
awesome
experience
i
need
to
get
another
one
to
cellar
maybe
a
couple
more

and
turn
the
beer
more
towards
pinesol
characteristics
a
very
intense
and
somewhat
brutal
beer
not
one
im
fond
to
try
again
thick
dextrinous
mouthfeel
and
modest
carbonation
this
beer
poured
a
dark
foggy
brown
with
light
red
highlights
giving
it
the
appearance
of
cherry
coke
when
i
poured
it
my
glass
was
a
third
barley
wine
a
third
head
and
the
remaining
third
was
a
sluggish
combination
of
the
two
it
took
a
few
seconds
to
settle
and
was
a
lot
of
fun
to
admire
the
head
then
quickly
fell
to
a
ring
smelled
of
sweet
caramel
malt
with
some
milk
chocolate
prunes
maraschino
cherries
and
a
solvent
alcohol
that
was
mixed
into
a
resinous
pine
hops
the
flavor
began
with
an
up
front
dry
pine
then
picked
up
some
sweet
cream
and
a
delightful
woody
barley
finished
with
a
dark
chocolate
and
some
intense
dry
piney
hops
with
an
alcohol
burn
unfortunately
i
inhaled
through
my
mouth
while
drinking
and
choked
on
solvent
vapors
the
mouth
feel
was
medium
bodied
and
sticky
with
a
light
carbonation
this
is
an
alright
beer
thats
a
little
heavy
on
the
hops
with
a
far
too
obvious
alcohol
this
could
definitely
stand
to
spend
some
time
in
the
cellar
having
said
that
the
mouthfeel
definitely
impressed
me
its
very
thick
and
syrupy
just
like
a
good
barleywine
should
be
i
trust
draegers
san
mateo
to
pick
good
beers
from
this
list
and
others
but
i
had
a
750
ml
of
old
crustacean
barley
wine
and
it
was
vile
could
be
a
corked
bunk
bottle
but
this
stuff
was
seriously
unrefined
and
i
can
take
a
foul
arrogant
bitter
ale
with
the
best
of
them
but
this
stuff
was
not
worth
the
price
shame
on
those
who
charge
top
buck
for
foul
ups
i
was
chowing
on
nice
and
mcchouffe
for
a
comparison
and
there
was
none

the
stuff
should
be
erotic
rogue
is
now
for
me
untrusted
for
charging
and
brewing
this
crap
this
is
the
best
barleywine
ive
tried
so
far
best
out
of
two
its
quite
an
interesting
style
not
what
im
used
to
but
i
respect
it
somewhat
murky
reddish
and
garnet
in
color
big
hoppy
and
grassy
aroma
sort
of
locker
room
sweat
which
doesnt
mean
a
bad
thing
big
sweet
malty
flavoralcohol
burn
is
slight
though
right
upfront
serious
hop
levels
great
grapefruit
flavors
slick
and
oily
mouthfeel
very
viscuous
on
the
tongue
a
hell
of
a
beer
get
some
would
love
to
try
this
without
that
salt
water
taste
as
it
really
affected
the
drinkability
drinkability
one
to
sip
and
enjoy
take
your
time
light
a
fire
and
enjoy
a
winter
day
with
this
one
very
nice
another
winner
from
rogue
overall
this
isnt
exactly
the
most
well
balanced
barleywine
style
ale
but
i
do
find
it
a
quite
enjoyable
brew
to
sip
on
i
recommend
it
this
is
one
intense
barley
wine
almost
too
intense
for
me
very
intense
robust
malty
and
dark
flavor
with
a
hop
finish
so
strong
that
it
destroys
everything
in
its
path
its
so
powerful
its
hard
to
review
apparently
the
ibus
on
this
one
is
around
120
and
i
can
believe
it
the
sharp
scent
on
this
draft
pour
is
raw
and
smells
like
cough
syrup
there
is
something
likeable
about
this
barley
wine
but
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
perhaps
its
surviving
the
intense
ride
its
not
very
drinkable
though
a
sipping
beer
for
occasional
use
200412oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
copper
to
bergundy
with
minimal
head
which
recedes
to
only
a
ring
after
a
short
time
nose
is
huge
and
complex
full
of
garden
scents
rasins
and
alcohol
taste
is
a
slam
of
fruits
up
front
with
raisins
spicy
peppers
onions
its
all
balanced
by
a
strong
malt
backbone
which
gives
texture
of
biscuits
or
toast
aftertaste
has
a
strong
but
not
unpleasant
alcoholic
warmth
i
had
bought
this
with
intentions
of
aging
it
but
got
impatient
as
tends
to
happen
enjoyed
it
nevertheless
however
out
of
a
limited
number
of
barleywines
ive
sampled
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
edging
out
stones
old
guardian
on
the
basis
of
more
flavor
less
burn
last
swigs
if
i
never
have
another
crusty
i
wont
mind
this
one
had
a
bit
too
much
flour
dough
and
a
bit
too
few
fruit
notes
decent
but
the
flour
aspect
was
a
sticking
point
this
is
an
amazing
barleywine
that
has
earned
a
spot
in
my
top
shelf
while
other
breweries
often
stumble
in
perfectly
balancing
the
massive
hops
malt
and
alcohol
in
this
style
rogue
truly
shines
of
those
i
have
tried
in
the
style
this
is
the
benchmark
to
aspire
towards
these
should
also
age
extremely
well
and
i
look
forward
to
rereviewing
in
the
future
nice
mouthfeel
with
a
pleasant
bitterness
fairly
easy
to
drink
for
a
10
year
old
barleywine
wow
best
barleywine
ive
had
to
date
damn
mouthfeel
was
pretty
smooth
but
a
little
thin
im
not
sure
the
three
years
this
barleywine
has
had
to
age
was
did
much
to
mellow
out
the
bitterness
based
on
some
other
reviews
ive
read
this
isnt
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
but
it
was
worth
the
try
this
is
very
strong
very
intense
but
not
so
much
as
the
heavey
weight
salt
somewhat
enjoyable
but
not
something
to
hit
hard
at
all
i
suggest
saving
one
or
two
bottles
of
old
crustacean
drink
the
others
while
theyre
young
drinkability

better
than
average
for
the
barleywine
style
but
not
overly
compelling
like
so
many
barleywines
i
bet
it
will
be
superb
in
several
years
it
tastes
like
it
has
a
lot
of
potential
this
beer
is
very
warming
not
to
mention
delicious
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
11
beer
im
convinced
rogue
could
bottle
sour
milk
and
it
would
still
somehow
taste
great
im
also
convinced
i
could
drink
this
outside
in
30
degree
weather
and
stay
warm
i
will
likely
be
buying
a
ceramic
bottle
of
this
next
time
im
in
north
carolina
a
taste
is
solid
not
at
first
at
first
the
astringent
hops
attack
despite
the
age
on
this
but
quickly
settles
to
a
wonderful
lasting
aftertaste
that
includes
figs
chocolatecovered
cherries
and
dark
roasted
coffee
the
mix
with
the
piney
and
grapefruity
hopflavor
results
in
an
intriguing
balance
finally
a
nice
alcholic
warmth
washes
over
a
great
winter
beer
for
those
bitter
cold
nights
not
that
we
have
too
many
here
florida
the
drinkability
is
good
despite
the
high
abv
typical
for
the
style
if
this
beer
doesnt
kick
you
in
the
sack
nothing
ever
will
and
you
need
a
palate
transplant
intense
and
now
i
need
a
fresh
bottle
to
blow
my
doors
off
again
this
thing
could
age
forever
surely
ive
heard
about
this
beer
being
extreme
and
all
that
hype
i
love
rogue
and
although
im
far
from
agreeing
with
the
whole
bigger
is
better
trend
in
beer
im
down
with
a
beer
that
pushes
the
boundaries
however
that
may
be
lets
see
how
this
one
stacks
up
ok
it
looks
pretty
killer
nice
dark
red
color
super
murky
smells
like
a
bomb
went
off
in
a
room
filled
with
chocolate
covered
cherries
that
had
started
to
rot
taste
is
super
flavorful
all
over
the
place
theres
a
big
chocolate
presence
that
i
havent
noticed
in
a
lof
of
barleywines
explosive
fruity
fig
newton
taste
also
rusty
bitter
dirty
hops
super
bitter
hops
and
super
sweet
fruity
malts
i
guess
thats
balanced
a
bit
thick
and
syrupy
on
the
palate
a
little
more
carbonation
would
ties
everything
together
a
bit
better
that
being
my
only
complaint
this
is
a
really
great
beer
an
interesting
take
on
a
broad
style
just
make
sure
you
ate
some
nails
for
breakfast
in
order
to
prepare
for
this
brew
this
beer
proves
once
again
my
love
for
rogue
beers
i
was
thinking
about
buying
a
few
and
cellaring
but
then
how
crazily
alcoholic
would
this
be
in
a
few
years
yikes
oh
hell
why
not
bottle

with

and
floralbitter
hops
mix
taste
is
a
mix
of
sweet
malt
and
an
incredible
amount
of
bitter
hops
in
fact
there
is
just
too
much
hops
in
this
to
make
it
truly
enjoyable
for
me
body
is
full
and
alcohol
is
also
present
and
provides
an
enjoyable
warming
feeling
but
in
the
end
i
guess
this
is
just
too
onedimensional
damn
tasty
for
me
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
hoppy
but
i
aint
complaining
ill
be
getting
more
of
this
and
shoving
it
in
the
cellar
for
damn
sure
very
strong
beer
at
a
little
cooler
than
room
temperature
it
becomes
somewhat
cumbersome
to
drink
i
guess
the
abv
is
justified
in
this
case
crazily
complex
a
great
beer
this
will
only
be
drinkable
to
those
who
love
big
hop
bitterness
even
after
three
years
2
years
in
my
cellar
i
will
save
my
other
bottle
for
another
5
before
trying
this
again
1016
note
just
looked
at
bottle
again
and
it
read
bottled
in
2003
save
your
money
for
old
foghorn
it
came
in
a
large
ceramic
type
bottle
with
the
pop
top
the
color
was
a
deep
reddishbrown
with
a
slight
head
smell
whoa
smells
like
lawn
clippings
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
it
tasted
pretty
much
the
way
it
smelled
like
lawn
clippings
very
bitter
lawn
clippings
didnt
really
think
much
of
the
mouth
feel
as
i
was
too
busy
wondering
if
someone
emptied
a
lawn
mower
added
some
faint
hops
and
manure
then
put
it
in
my
bottle
overall
not
a
great
ale
actually
it
was
horrible
i
poured
the
rest
of
the
bottle
out
eventually
definitely
not
something
ill
ever
drink
again
if
i
have
a
choice
all
in
all
a
classic
barleywine
that
pulls
no
punches
chuck
bednarik
would
approve
this
is
smashmouth
barleywine
that
still
sticks
around
to
remind
other
more
modern
barleywines
where
they
came
from
even
john
at
rogue
admits
that
this
is
a
tough
drinker
a
good
history
lesson
but
theres
much
better
in
the
way
of
barleywines
out
there
ive
had
this
before
and
for
some
reason
forgot
the
mind
blowing
force
of
this
beer
the
first
sip
i
took
leveled
me
however
this
is
an
incredible
beverage
and
another
great
production
from
rogue
i
loved
it
but
12
oz
is
a
whole
lot
for
one
sitting
uf
12
oz
bottle
bottled
in
2004
poured
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
gorgeous
ruby
red
amber
very
clear
with
a
slight
tan
head
that
quickly
reduces
to
a
small
spotty
cap
a
small
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
a
big
sweet
fruitinesscherries
and
figswith
a
caramel
malt
and
some
decently
big
piney
hops
taste
is
very
hoppy
a
huge
dose
of
bitterness
definitely
the
first
thing
noticed
coming
back
for
a
second
sip
there
is
a
strong
malty
dark
fruit
sweetness
upfront
a
slight
bit
of
caramel
and
then
comes
the
mammoth
wave
of
hops
really
a
nice
tasting
barleywinenice
hop
flavor
but
the
sweet
malt
keeps
the
bitterness
from
overwhelming
never
a
hint
of
the
11
alcohol
full
bodied
with
a
syrupy
slightly
coating
feel
most
barley
wines
are
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
but
this
leans
the
other
way
and
i
really
like
it
could
definitely
drink
a
couple
in
a
session
which
is
a
dangerous
thing
fantastic
brew
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
the
ceramic
bottle
in
came
in
was
a
nice
bonus
looks
fantastic
its
hard
to
come
by
where
im
at
but
ive
already
ordered
a
case
of
six
at
50
a
case
and
feel
its
a
bargain
d
my
advice
is
to
sip
and
savor
in
small
amounts
still
overpriced
though
it
was
nice
to
try
the
taste
is
initially
sweet
with
hints
of
butterscotch
then
the
hops
hit
this
is
the
hoppiest
beer
ive
had
to
date
the
hoppy
taste
never
leaves
your
mouth
between
each
sipi
love
it
it
really
tingles
your
whole
mouth
a
wild
taste
that
i
would
like
to
cellar
and
see
what
happens
with
age
excellent
digestif
my
advice
next
time
someone
makes
fun
of
you
for
drinking
fancy
beer
a
little

deep

51this
is
just
craft
beer
gone
wrong
they
had
tapped
a
keg
of
1996
vintage
old
crustacean
this
is
one
robust
and
complex
barleywine
very
rich
in
malt
flavor
with
a
serious
mouthfeell
syrupy
with
a
bitter
finish
a
warming
and
intense
brew
one
of
the
best
of
this
style
that
i
have
sampled
recommended
old
crustacean
was
served
from
a
silkscreened
12
oz
bottle
dated
2002
aged
2
years
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
a
rich
and
very
deep
and
attractive
mahogany
brown
and
was
topped
by
a
thin
light
brown
head
the
nose
was
extremely
complex
and
wonderful
with
exploding
textured
roasty
mushroomy

woody
maltiness
irratic
plumes
of
varnishlike
alchohl
caught
my
nose
from
time
to
time
sweet
notes
are
present
but
stuggle
to
escape
on
the
palate
a
big
roasty
peaty
malt
profile
with
some
nice
cocoa
nuances
reared
back
to
release
searing
scotchlike
alcohol
flavors
that
warmed
the
throat
on
the
way
down
a
huge
complementing
bitterness
came
through
this
in
the
finish
leaving
lingering
roasty
lightly
astringent
nutty
notes
the
medium
body
felt
good
for
the
flavors
and
character
of
the
beer
as
for
drinkability
it
suffers
considerably
due
to
the
completely
detached
alcohol
thoughout
i
sipped
it
like
as
if
it
were
scotch
and
i
barely
got
through
the
bottle
despite
this
harshness
the
nose
was
amazingly
developed
and
good
flavors
made
it
enjoyable

just
a
bit
short
i
think
more
residual
sweetness
would
make
this
a
killer
barleywine
very
drinkable
but
the
flavor
is
in
that
grey
area
between
american
double
ipa
and
barleywine
expecting
one
or
the
other
may
skew
your
results
blood
red
cloudy
pour
with
a
head
that
was
a
couple
of
inches
thick
the
aroma
was
sweet
hazelnuts
flowery
hops
and
a
musty
leathery
funk
the
taste
is
very
powerful
with
a
malty
and
hoppy
punch
to
your
face
that
makes
you
sit
up
and
take
notice
a
very
complex
series
of
flavors
is
found
here
as
each
sip
starts
off
as
an
innocent
mixture
of
sweet
dark
skinned
fruits
and
ends
up
as
a
roasty
peppery
tobacco
juice
that
makes
your
head
spin
just
an
incredible
beer
that
shows
what
we
had
been
missing
for
nearly
70
years
in
georgia
the
taste
was
of
strong
musty
malt
and
reminded
me
almost
of
hopped
whisky
quite
interesting
as
it
warmed
the
alcohol
became
more
prominent
this
was
definitely
a
sipping
beer
but
a
good
one
and
worth
having
again
especially
with
different
vintages
leaves
with
a
feeling
of
warmth
not
only
in
the
belly
but
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
as
well
this
12oz
was
bottled
in
2002
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
that
leaves
a
little
bit
of
nice
looking
lace
around
the
glass
as
it
is
consumed
aroma
smell
of
sweet
fruits
citrus
hops
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
sharp
at
first
with
a
big
bitterness
followed
sweet
malt
flavors
and
alcohol
this
was
a
bit
rough
on
the
first
sip
but
got
better
as
it
was
consumed
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
and
it
goes
down
fairly
easily
considering
the
bitterness
and
alcohol
tastes
overall
a
great
barley
wine
that
could
probably
stand
to
age
another
year
or
so
this
is
a
big
beer
and
the
first
sip
announces
that
loads
of
alcohol
and
crazy
hop
levels
lead
me
to
dislike
this
at
first
but
some
caramel
sweet
aspects
peek
in
towards
the
end
to
bring
it
back
more
into
my
realm
that
sweetness
is
replaced
again
by
the
hops
for
a
slightly
bitter
finish
but
overall
this
is
an
excellent
barley
wine
once
you
let
it
warm
slightly
thick
mouhtfeel
but
still
highly
drinkable
wow
this
brew
really
impressed
me
not
a
super
drinkable
brew
makes
a
good
one
to
shock
your
taste
buds
notes
not
blown
away
but
a
good
drink
the
mouthfeel
is
sharp
and
potent
like
any
other
good
barleywine
all
things
considered
its
pretty
drinkable
too
12

this
is
a

excellent
night
capper
the
hops
have
definitely
faded
a
little
on
this
one
this
is
a
real
treat
and
i
would
try
it
again
just
be
ready
for
a
big
beer
this
beer
has
a
dark
purplebrown
colored

small
khaki
colored

on

big
mnalt
scent
chocolate
and

the
taste
has
an
intense

character
with
a
bitter
hop
backbone
chewy
mouthfeel
sticks
to
the
throat
as
well
the
alcohol
becomes
evident
as
the
beer
warms
this
beer
is
not
for
pussies
and
will
leave
you
feeling
old
and
crusty
when
youre
done
dark
brown
with
a
light
red
hue
hazy
with
a
tan
head
fresh
piney
hop
aroma
with
citrus
and
fruity
brown
sugar
quite
hoppy
with
mostly
oily
piney
hops
brown
sugar
berries
and
oranges
toffee
flavors
emerge
as
the
beer
warms
creating
a
very
pleasant
complexity
really
nice
just
shy
of
full
bodied
beer
with
a
perfect
amount
of
light
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
definitely
present
but
not
overwhelming
but
when
coupled
with
an
intensely
bitter
hop
aftertaste
the
drinkability
of
this
great
tasting
beer
takes
a
slight
hit
from
what
it
maybe
should
be
this
is
one
of
the
few
instances
in
which
i
will
say
that
i
wish
there
were
a
little
less
hops
not
in
the
taste
but
the
aftertaste
with
age
to
mellow
the
hops
a
bit
i
think
this
has
potential
for
greatness
ill
be
picking
up
a
few
more
bottles
to
find
out
flavor
starts
sweet
with
molasses
and
brown
sugar
rising
godzilla
like
from
these
deep
swampy
mucks
of
flavor
is
the
warming
fire
tandem
of
bitter
piney
hops
which
sweep
the
tongue
of
most
of
the
malt
what
is
left
is
quickly
removed
by
the
warming
alcohol
that
leaves
a
mulled
ale
feeling
in
your
throat
still
a
powerful
brew
even
in
its
old
age
i
was
very
fortunate
to
catch
this
on
tap
which
the
folks
at
rogue
brought
so
graciously
for
their
tasting
at
my
local
the
fresh
version
is
inspired
but
this
is
sublime
like
a
talented
young
artist
with
a
brilliant
career
creating
his
finest
masterpiece
in
the
autumn
of
life
quite
a
brew
with
enough
age
on
it
worth
hanging
onto
a
couple
bottles
for
this
kind
of
experience
im
stocking
up
on
the
current
release
to
set
aside
for
maturation
also
going
back
to
the
store
that
had
2002
on
the
shelf
and
buying
whatever
remains
deep
caramel
brown
color
practically
no
head
aroma
of
a
freshly
baked
cinnamon
rolls
and
raisins
bittersweet
warmth
full
flavored
minimal
carbonation
not
sure
how
long
is
the
ideal
aging
for
this
beer
should
be
but
i
cant
imagining
it
getting
much
better
a
very
tasty
barleywine
and
not
too
pricy
either
2001
bottling
sampled
07th
of
april
2004
damn
that
was
my
last
bottle
taste
is
an
alcohol
burn
up
front
spicy
and
swet
caramel
richly
malty
sweetness
a
very
strong
hop
bite
big
hops
for
big
malt
very
well
balanced
the
hops
dominate
the
finish
and
the
aftertaste
chewy
malt
like
molasses
really
smooth
and
drinkable
even
though
this
is
probably
a
bit
young
for
peak
flavors
i
am
going
to
lay
some
of
these
down
opening
this
it
appeared
to
be
a
darkamber
in
color
which
did
not
give
much
head
but
did
form
some
edgeline
around
the
goblet
i
served
it
at
room
temperature
which
i
do
for
most
of
my
beers
i
taste
this
barleywine
is
very
floral
in
aroma
with
a
hint
of
sugar
or
caramel
mixed
in
there
somewhere
upon
tasting
this
it
gave
first
a
sweet
taste
caramel
and
some
hints
of
fruit
come
through
particularly
raisins
but
soon
became
more
of
a
sour
hoppy
taste
overall
in
which
the
alcohol
came
through
very
apparently
more
at
the
end
11
3
yeah
right
i
am
betting
the
abv
is
more
around
1415
at
this
point
bottled
in
2002
this
beer
has
a
great
texture
creamy
smooth
but
has
some
kick
at
the
assend
due
to
the
alcohol
the
carbonation
is
stingy
at
the
front
on
my
tongue
and
maintains
itself
throughout
i
really
enjoy
this
fine
rogue
beverage
yet
again
why
they
are
as
good
as
they
are
this
crusty
reminds
me
of
a
strong
belgian
dark
ale
minus
the
spices
and
yeast
character
overall
a
nice
introduction
to
the
barleywine
style
old
crustacean
is
very
drinkable
i
refuse
to
consider
drinkability
by
how
many
i
will
drink
in
a
session
no
barleywine
will
ever
be
a
session
beer
my
basis
in
drinkability
is
will
i
come
back
to
this
again
and
again
yes
this
is
hands
down
the
hoppiest
barleywine
ive
had
and
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
on
tap
at
henry
street
ale
house
brooklyn
deep
reddishbrown
good
tan
head
with
some
lacing
aroma
was
alcoholic
with
some
hops
detected
not
too
strong
a
bit
sherrylike
taste
was
big
and
warming
there
was
a
marked
bitterness
from
the
hops
which
increased
steadily
as
the
balancing
maltiness
was
overpowered
and
faded
out
alcohol
could
be
tasted
too
giving
a
nice
warming
sensation
good
timing
as
there
was
a
blizzard
raging
outside
a
slight
hint
of
burnt
malt
came
through
too
towards
the
end
the
finish
was
bitter
with
a
good
long
aftertaste
2002
version
the
hops
are
still
running
wild
but
the
spiciness
has
mellowed
while
still
leaving
plenty
of
bitterness
it
is
also
more
sweet
with
definite
caramel
notes
i
dont
notice
the
tobacco
flavor
so
many
have
mentioned
absolutely
delicious
drinkability
only
if
you
plan
on
going
nowhere
i
find
it
hard
to
imagine
getting
this
on
tap
anywhere
unless
they
strictly
limit
the
number
of
pints
someone
can
have
of
this
while
ive
downed
imperial
stouts
at
10abv
without
a
second
thought
this
is
simply
too
much
for
me
is
it
a
bad
beer
no
otherwise
my
scoring
would
have
been
brutal
its
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
had
it
with
dinner
but
i
think
it
would
have
been
better
alone
it
demands
your
attention
2
yr
old
bottle
dark
bronze
hue
with
a
small
tan
head
aroma
is
hugely
hoppy
piney
with
slight
lactic
notes
of
yogurt
and
a
good
chocolatey
and
caramelic
malt
presence
taste
is
very
hoppy
aggresively
predominent
bitterness
that
hides
everything
else
grapefruit
and
resin
in
abundance
mediumbodied
huge
sipper
that
is
worth
a
try
but
definitely
not
my
bag
2002
vintage
i
have
to
admit
this
is
my
first
barley
wine
and
i
was
a
little
intimidated
by
this
beer
i
expected
to
not
like
it
is
my
palate
ready
for
this
boy
was
i
wrong
i
was
intrigued
by
the
murky
brown
color
no
head
to
speak
of
the
aroma
was
strong
and
hoppy
the
flavor
well
what
can
i
say
its
very
powerful
alternatingly
sweet
and
bitter
earthy
and
airy
hoppy
and
malty
huge
flavors
that
play
off
of
each
other
and
yet
balance
delicately
and
wonderfully
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
while
you
may
not
want
to
pound
these
all
night
the
complex
flavor
has
you
looking
forward
to
the
next
sip
a
wonderful
experience
bottled
in
2002
this
brew
poured
a
dark
root
beer
color
opaque
murky
in
the
glass
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
in
the
bottle
and
a
very
small
offwhite
tannish
head
big
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
caramel
and
wet
forest
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
slightly
tingly
with
a
smooth
syrupy
coating
wonderful
taste
with
a
muted
sweetness
and
suggestions
of
sarsaparilla
and
coffee
somewhat
disappointingly
ending
in
a
rather
bitter
aftertaste
but
not
so
much
as
to
reverse
the
enjoyment
pretty
drinkable
for
the
style
but
you
probably
wouldnt
be
pounding
these
back
picked
up
one
of
these
at
the
store
and
saw
that
it
was
vintage
2002
oh
someone
has
aged
this
should
be
interesting
turnsout
this
is
a
fine
barleywine
pours
very
dark
brown
with
a
small
head
the
lace
stays
nose
is
hoppy
and
carmelly
taste
is
strong
but
balanced
lots
of
hops
malt
caramel
very
good
mouthfeel
i
dont
think
this
happened
overnight
i
am
glad
this
was
aged
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
a
great
sipper
pours
a
dark
brownishamber
with
a
wispy
tan
head
minimal
carbonation
and
disappearing
head
are
expected
because
of
the
alcohol
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
alcohol
and
spicy
piney
hops
the
intense
malt
aromas
that
i
expect
in
a
barleywine
are
certainly
present
but
theyre
pushed
aside
by
the
hops
the
foretaste
is
notably
malty
and
quite
sweet
but
the
sensation
is
quickly
overrun
by
the
intense
hoppiness
alcohol
warming
hits
after
the
first
few
sips
and
the
alcohol
taste
is
evident
in
throughout
the
beer
the
finish
is
all
hopsany
other
subtlety
is
simply
overpowered
by
the
spicy
bitterness
this
is
a
west
coast
barleywine
taken
to
extremes
and
worth
having
for
that
very
reason
id
love
to
try
one
after
it
aged
for
half
a
dozen
years
what
can
i
say
about
this
one
a
true
hopheads
barleywine
fantastic
find
this
one
whenever
you
can
this
beer
is
a
rather
murky
reddish
amber
color
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
very
little
lacing
to
be
found
the
aroma
is
potent
alcohol
along
with
some
malt
and
caramel
the
body
is
on
the
chewy
side
and
the
flavor
is
rather
harsh
ethyl
alcohol
at
first
but
it
mellows
a
bit
as
it
warms
the
earthy
tones
and
malt
and
caramel
flavors
are
more
prevalent
later
on
the
finish
is
very
spicy
and
hoppy
throughout
overall
this
beer
has
would
be
a
better
experience
if
it
was
not
so
unbalanced
from
the
getgo
it
just
takes
a
little
too
long
to
reach
its
potential
brown
body
with
redorange
highlights
a
creamy
halffinger
biege
head
clinging
hard
to
the
sides
as
it
morphs
into
a
tabletopper
nose
fills
with
caramel
hard
candy
licorice
ripened
fruitand
alcohol
thick
sweet
malt
bathes
the
tongue
and
leaves
a
large
dollop
of
warming
alcohol
theres
a
wave
hello
of
hops
in
the
middle
but
fleeting
a
sudden
rise
and
quick
goodbye
the
hops
may
have
passed
on
from
age
but
they
did
not
mellow
the
beer
as
much
as
i
would
like
too
sweet
and
too
strong
the
sense
of
the
alcohol
as
opposed
to
what
the
actual
abv
is
if
the
beer
was
younger
the
sweetness
might
have
more
balance
but
i
fear
what
the
alcohol
prescence
would
be
like
for
barleywines
id
prefer
old
salty
bigfoot
or
blithering
idiot
rogue
makes
a
host
of
beers
i
love
this
is
not
one
of
them
drinkability
is
somewhat
disappointing
and
not
all
that
high
for
me
i
found
the
prevalent
burning
alcohol
feel
to
be
to
distracting
i
imagine
if
i
tried
an
aged
bottle
i
would
rate
the
drinkability
a
lot
higher
but
as
far
as
the
2003
goes
im
sippin
slow
dark
ruby
body
with
a
rather
large
sticky
tan
head
very
nice
smells
of
rich
sweet
toffee
malts
backed
almost
overwhelmingly
by
scotch
taperesinytaiga
hops
taste
starts
off
with
rich
chewy
sweet
malts
butter
toffee
and
some
fruitiness
the
mouthfeel
is
big
and
chewy
this
is
all
followed
by
gigantic
hops
very
strong
similar
to
bigfoot
and
maybe
a
little
bit
too
much
aging
might
help
mellow
this
sucker
out
a
fine
barleywine
offering
from
rogue
definitely
not
lacking
in
hops
at
120
ibus
quite
good
and
absolutely
one
id
have
again
next
barleywine
season
overall
this
is
a
memorable
beer
not
because
it
has
great
qualities
but
because
the
qualities
it
does
have
are
very
intense
2002
vintage
rubyamber
body
with
little
traces

sweet

with
a
good
dosage
of
alcohol
in
there
as
well
despite
this
having
some
age
under
its
belt
it
hasnt
mellowed
much
actually
i
think
its
kind
of
out
of
balance
still
tastes
pretty
good
but
its
dominated
by
a
toasted
malt
character
and
the
alcohol
seems
to
take
over
too
much
in
the
finish
the
hops
are
there
but
not
enough
of
them
to
keep
things
in
balance
this
is
still
a
decent
barleywine
but
there
are
so
many
better
american
interpretations
of
the
style
from
a
7
oz
bottle
dated
1998
an
unimpressive
pour
totally
flat
with
big

chunks

releases

theres
no

a

with

this
is

of

gives
an

a
very
good
representation
of
the
barleywine
style
well
balanced
flavor
great
balance
between
tasty
hops
and
solid
malts
both
really
rich
and
strong
without
one
overpowering
the
other
overall
despite
a
lot
of
negativity
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
to
start
off
this
was
a
beer
that
was
aged
in
a
plastic
keg
for
a
year
i
had
to
ask
the
bartender
if
it
was
the
barrel
aged
or
the
normal
big
worse
very
boozy
not
smooth
at
all
lots
of
hot
alcohol
in
it
i
would
like
to
try
this
beer
out
of
the
bottle
maybe
sitting
in
plastic
for
a
year
was
not
a
good
idea
the
boozy
whiskey
like
flavor
kinda
drowned
out
everything
in
this
beer
the
head
was
non
existent
and
the
only
aroma
i
could
get
was
alcohol
notes
this
beer
definitely
needs
a
second
try
for
me
probably
the
worst
thing
ive
had
mikkeller
the
name
is
about
right
on
this
one
full
of
sticky
malt
flavor
with
an
almost
syrupy
consistency
had
on
tap
alcohol
comes
through
very
balanced
with
the
bitterness
i
certainly
hope
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
because
if
it
wasnt
myohmy
is
this
a
terrible
beer
the
beer
itself
wasnt
all
too
wellcarbonated
the
cork
didnt
come
out
with
much
of
a
pop
either
i
hope
its
just
a
bad
bottle
for
mikkellers
sake
oby
far
the
highest
abv
ive
seen
in
a
barleywine
this
brew
is
a
one
hitter
quitter
i
love
everything
mikkeller
does
brilliance
in
brewing
pours
a
brownish
body
with
moderate
head
and
lace
and
textbook
aroma
of
citric
earthy
hops
and
a
hearty
malt
aroma
of
both
bready
roasted
malts
and
sweet
malt
a
good
barleywine
and
mostly
holds
up
but
it
seems
at
some
points
the
alcohol
make
it
a
tad
bitter
or
burning
on
the
backend
overall
the
hops
give
it
citric
zip
and
spice
and
the
sweet
malts
make
themselves
known
and
it
has
a
little
stickiness
and
tartdark
fruit
edge
it
is
a
good
beer
designed
to
be
a
sipper
that
just
a
has
a

of
small
chinks
in
the

else

would
have
scored

a

higher
if
it
actually
had

but
thankfully
not
much

was
present
an
enjoyable
sipper
o
total
bummer
i
found
this
gem
in
the
back
of
a
cooler
at
ledgers
with
the
price
tag
showing
that
they
recieved
it
in
feb
of
2009
i
knew
this
was
an
old
beer
when
i
got
into
it
but
figured
if
its
sitting
back
in
the
fridge
it
would
be
worth
a
shot
man
was
i
wrong
got
about
2
sips
in
before
i
drain
poured
it
all
well
live
and
learn
worth
the
risk
o
it
gets
better
as
i
finish
it
not
sure
if
the
taste
is
improving
or
the
12
0
abv
has
kicked
in
i
wont
be
finishing
this
pretty
disappointing
ive
got
another
bottle
but
im
not
too
excited
to
give
it
another
shot
reading
the
datestamped
reviews
of
others
its
apparent
that
mikkeller
has
gotten
better
at
making
this
beer
its
an
incredible
americanstyle
barleywine
that
captures
the
preferred
malt
character
of
hearty
english
examples
its
a
bright
and
highly
rewarding
ale
for
nightcapping
any
evening
o
really
nice
barleywine
would
love
to
try
fresh
i
had
this
sitting
around
for
a
while
and
finally
got
around
to
drinking
it
i
almost
wish
i
had
someone
to
share
it
with
but
what
can
you
do
o
a
simple
and
strong
barleywine
honestly
i
liked
big
worst
better
it
was
better
balanced
and
tastier
in
general
despite
being
flat
this
one
is
pretty
meh
overall
i
wish
this
tasted
like
it
smelled
end
of
story
o
not
quite
as
bad
as
i
expected
from
the
pour
but
not
very
good
wow
a
pretty
easydrinking
yankee
barleywine
if
there
ever
was
big
brash
but
somehow
subtle
at
the
same
rate
with
a
deftly
integrated
upsized
alcohol
quotient
totally
worth
giving
a
go
especially
given
our
early
winter
november
1
really
a
true
oddity
and
perhaps
the
first
mikkeller
beer
that
didnt
blow
me
away
it
pours
a
cloudy
light
amber
to
red
color
with
a
ton
of
big
yeast
particles
floating
around
and
finally
settling
to
the
bottom
there
is
almost
no
head
the
nose
is
alcohol
and
caramel
english
malt
flavor
is
the
same
but
spiced
up
a
bit
from
the
yeast
it
feels
like
the
right
mix
of
flavors
for
fall
but
the
alcohol
is
strong
and
caustic
and
it
hurts
the
overall
product
the
mouthfeel
would
be
great
without
the
alcohol
burn
its
got
a
nice
full
body
but
is
well
carbonated
and
therefore
seems
to
dance
in
the
mouth
even
with
all
that
sediment
the
booze
just
kills
it
though
warm
on
the
way
down
too
overall
a
very
unique
take
on
a
barleywine
but
not
somehting
i
will
spend
15
dollars
on
again
although
my
local
shop
has
the
red
wine
version
too
which
might
be
nice
to
try
well
see
overall
i
thought
this
was
better
than
previous
reviews
would
have
me
believe
perhaps
since
its
a
mikkeller
brew
hopes
were
higher
by
for
some
people
is
it
my
favorite
american
barleywine
ever
no
is
it
something
i
would
drink
again
yes
the
price
may
be
slightly
high
for
the
size
of
the
bottle
but
i
would
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
shot
o
from
reading
some
reviews
i
was
kind
of
bummed
but
after
tasting
this
for
myself
i
can
say
it
surprised
me
this
is
far
better
than
expected
granted
its
outrageously
overpriced
but
that
aside
its
fantastically
complex
and
well
blended
the
yeast
settlement
was
rather
large
and
chunky
but
not
at
all
a
ruiner
if
the
price
was
cheaper
i
would
buy
this
on
a
regular
basis
but
its
too
steep
for
my
pockets
well
done
carbonation
is
perfectly
soft
body
seems
overtly
syrupy
though
i
sipped
this
for
about
3
hours
yes
12oz
for
3
hours
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
at
that
pace
it
was
enjoyable
and
i
would
savor
an
evening
with
it
again
but
it
is
a
bit
expensive
for
what
it
really
is
o
i
could
imagine
a
2009
bottle
being
really
good
at
this
point
but
the
2007
vintage
is
well
past
its
prime
cool
to
try
but
wouldnt
have
it
again
i
suggest
you
open
anything
from
200920082007
asap
o
ok
but
wont
be
going
out
of
my
way
to
buy
again
i
will
be
aging
a
bottle
for
a
year
and
will
report
back
the
differences
however
if
youre
looking
for
something
delicious
right
out
of
the
glass
mikkeller
has
many
more
great
offerings
available
overall
not
sure
of
the
age
of
this
bottle
as
i
got
it
as
an
extra
in
a
recent
trade
cannot
remember
who
sent
it
but
am
rather
disappointed
in
this
beer
regardless
of
bottling
date
as
a
barleywine
should
hold
up
better
than
this
one
has
tmo
meh
its
pretty
decent
thicksweet
and
very
flat
with
no
carbonation
whatsoever
rich
grape
juice
and
trace
caramel
not
very
satisfying
a
pretty
damn
boring
barleywine
all
told
not
one
of
mikkellers
greater
beers
sweet
and
flat
with
very
little
depth
of
flavour
or
mouthfeel
o
just
ok
definitely
a
sipper
and
felt
near
the
end
like
i
was
just
trying
to
get
through
it
not
something
i
look
for
in
a
10
a
bottle
beer
overall
inexcusable
amounts
of
sediment
am
i
supposed
to
pour
it
in
or
save
it
for
a
hideous
second
glass
at
10
a
bottle
its
a
travesty
to
have
to
leave
15
behind
that
said
the
beer
itself
isnt
awful
but
im
not
about
to
buy
it
or
drink
it
again
got
this
on
growler
and
it
pours
an
impressive
very
dark
non
see
through
mahogany
hue
and
leaves
a
three
finger
creamy
moon
faced
head
and
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is
hoppy
as
with
aromas
of
pinegrapefruitorange
zestxmas
pudding
and
toffee
and
to
be
quite
honest
very
similar
to
a
dipathe
mouthfeel
is
just
full
bodied
and
warming
with
tastes
of
burnt
toffeeboozy
alcoholmarzipancaramel
treaclefruitcake
and
finished
with
a
candied
citrus
bittersweetness
thats
more
sweet
than
bitter
and
overall
its
a
nice
enough
drop
but
probably
a
little
hoppier
than
your
usual
barleywines
cheers
d
greatly
drinkable
and
balanced
for
such
a
big
beer
c
o
i
can
only
imagine
how
smooth
and
balanced
it
will
become
overtime
ill
sure
be
picking
up
another
one
of
these
to
age
o
i
find
this
to
be
a
nice
barleywine
i
particularly
love
the
fruity
sweet
flavor
profile
and
the
fact
that
the
hops
dont
overwhelm
all
of
the
malt
and
alcohol
flavors
i
just
wish
the
body
were
a
bit
fuller
o
quite
impressive
it
doesnt
have
the
mikkeller
signature
boozy
taste
good
flavor
good
aroma

people
that
drink
barleywine
do
it
for

own

its

i
like
to

out
on
a
cold
and
rainy
tuesday
this
would
stand
up
well
as
its
already
almost
flat
and
has
lots
of
both
malt
and
hops
may
grab
another
for
the
cellar
the
yeast
dregs
dont
add
much
to
the
hop
centric
drive
and
rich
imperial
body
poured
from
a
330ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
didnt
see
a
best
on
date
but
it
was
a
green
bottle
this
pours
a
very
yeast
dreg
filled
hazy
brown
with
a
very
frofty
thick
tan
head
the
smells
are
very
fruity
full
of
sweet
malts
some
caramel
and
a
little
hops
the
feel
is
pretty
thick
the
taste
is
pretty
good
a
load
of
sweet
fruit
and
caramel
malts
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
little
alcohol
burn
on
the
way
down
overall
this
was
pretty
good
and
worth
getting
but
honestly
bigfoot
at
the
same
price
for
a
6
pack
as
a
single
bottle
of
this
is
better
and
a
better
deal
overall
a
very
enjoyable
barleywine
that
will
only
get
better
with
age
final
thought
14
is
high
but
at
12
and
yummy
it
is
worth
a
try
o
nothing
i
wouldnt
expect
from
mikkeller
a
delicious
multifaceted
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
then
one
overall
picked
up
a
half
case
of
these
in
june
so
interested
to
see
what
age
will
do
with
this
taste
is
okay
with
some
similar
characteristics
as
the
smell
didnt
find
this
to
have
the
best
balance
with
each
sip
being
either
too
sweet
or
too
boozy
overall
kinda
disappointed
it
was
sort
of
drinkable
but
not
that
enjoyable
pours
a
deep
orange
color
semihazy
but
i
can
see
through
to
the
other
side
head
is
a
thin
ring
of
lace
but
i
do
see
tiny
bubbles
stuck
to
the
glass
and
rising
to
the
surface
i
can
see
sediment
in
the
bottle
so
i
poured
this
very
slowly
as
to
not
disturb
the
yeast
i
succeeded
aroma
is
toffee
caramel
pine
and
some
faint
citrus
smells
very
sweet
i
like
this
so
far
starts
off
cloying
in
the
mouth
tons
of
caramel
sweetness
comes
first
then
comes
the
toffee
the
brew
then
takes
a
complete
180
and
morphs
into
a
nice
pine
flavor
that
leaves
a
dry
finish
in
the
mouth
overall
incredible
beer
the
alcohol
is
there
in
the
taste
but
not
overly
boozy
the
nice
dry
finish
keeps
this
from
being
too
sweet
surprisingly
balanced
definitely
different
from
other
barley
wines
out
there
but
that
makes
it
memorable
overall
i
liked
this
beer
but
remember
a
little
more
bourbon
barrel
presence
the
last
time
i
tried
it
overall
drinkability
this
thing
kicks
you
in
the
mouth
with
out
even
a
noticeable
hop
presence
d
mikkeller
beers
can
be
hit
or
miss
in
my
experience
this
kinda
falls
in
between
interesting
take
on
an
american
barleywine
o
the
boozy
flavour
is
not
hidden
enough
and
dominates
the
flavour
o
powerful
dark
sweet
delicious
needs
a
sharp
cheese
to
partner
up
with
for
maximum
results
o
im
always
happy
when
someone
brings
a
mikkeller
beer
to
a
tasting
i
cant
think
of
a
more
consistently
awful
brewery
and
i
feel
i
dont
rate
harshly
enough
most
of
the
time
this
brewery
is
a
good
way
to
bring
that
average
town
usually
15
a
pop
for
bottled
garbage
still
this
one
is
unpleasant
but
not
totally
irredeemable
for
mikkeller
its
even
good
nicely
balanced
sweet
with
bitter
finish
good
barleywine
othree
years
seems
to
be
the
sweet
spot
on
this
one
it
hasnt
been
hurt
by
lack
of
carbonation
theres
a
slight
edge
of
oxidation
creeping
in
so
if
you
have
any
2008
bottles
lying
around
now
would
be
a
good
time
to
open
them
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
brown
colored
liquid
with
a
very
small
amount
of
head
the
head
that
was
there
vanished
really
fast
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
nice
sweet
dark
fruit
aromas
some
are
a
little
more
pungent
but
its
a
unique
aroma
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
good
amount
of
hops
that
tingle
the
tongue
while
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
unfolds
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
too
bad
here
but
i
feel
it
could
have
been
better
overall
this
beer
wasnt
too
bad
id
like
to
get
a
fresher
bottle
sometime
d
this
was
a
very
potent
barleywine
with
bold
and
tasty
flavors
the
body
was
ok
but
it
was
pretty
hot
so
it
must
be
sipped
age
would
probably
really
help
mellow
and
integrate
the
flavors
it
was
still
enjoyable
fresh
but
not
excellent
i
had
been
eyeing
this
beer
for
awhile
so
when
i
saw
it
on
sale
for
6
i
snatched
it
big
mistake
reddishbrown
cor
with
no
head
and
no
carbonation
whatsoever
smells
oxidized
old
like
really
old
cake
or
something
the
taste
is
cardboard
sugar
just
not
good
at
all
mikkeller
is
just
too
hit
or
miss
for
me
with
the
misses
outweighing
the
hits
by
far
overall
i
am
very
pleased
with
this
beer
i
was
worried
that
it
was
going
to
be
a
round
house
kick
in
the
mouth
or
make
me
grow
a
full
beard
by
the
time
i
was
done
drinking
it
i
would
imagine
this
beer
is
still
not
for
everyone
not
my
favorite
mikkeller
beer
but
i
still
like
it
on
the
whole
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
falls
a
little
flat
o
a
delicious
beer
not
at
the
same
level
as
big
worst
but
still
a
delight
alcohol
nearly
imperceptible
worth
seeking
out
thick
brown
though
you
can
see
some
light
through
it
no
head
and
a
nice
lace
top
it
off
smell
is
hopped
for
sure
but
with
a
subtle
sugary
undertone
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
too
taste
is
not
very
strong
at
all
there
is
the
natural
piney
hoppness
you
would
expect
from
a
barley
wine
but
not
too
strong
there
is
also
a
sugary
nuttiness
about
it
as
well
the
alcohol
is
there
and
that
keeps
this
a
sipper
it
is
actually
nicely
carbonated
and
not
harsh
going
down
has
the
warm
feeling
on
the
way
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
o
not
to
bad
sat
well
with
me
would
not
mind
drinking
another
easy
drinker
fail
skål
o
this
is
a
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
beer
not
the
most
physically
attractive
beer
but
drinkable
nonetheless
overall
i
like
the
flavor
of
this
beer
but
it
isnt
backed
up
as
well
by
the
supporting
elements
ive
got
the
bourbon
barrel
edition
sitting
in
the
cellar
will
try
that
soon
killer
brew
a
bit
over
priced
like
all
mikkellers
but
still
very
happy
with
the
purchase
overall
not
a
bad
drink
just
wish
it
had
a
little
more
carbonation
was
kind
of
like
drinking
an
ugly
looking
wine
pours
an
ugly
brown
color
with
loads
of
sediment
toward
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
no
head
or
lacing
the
nose
carried
caramel
toffee
cherry
and
dark
fruits
there
was
a
bit
of
light
booze
in
the
background
as
well
the
flavor
focused
on
malt
sweetness
with
some
mild
fruit
caramel
held
throughout
as
well
as
a
bit
of
alcohol
medium
body
and
slightly
boozy
not
bad
at
all
o
overall
pretty
solid
barleywine
too
thin
of
mouthfeel
for
me
flavor
was
not
as
complex
as
some
of
the
best
a
bit
to
sweet
wonder
if
it
will
develop
a
better
balance
over
time
tasted
at
a
beer
sampling
at
de
klomp
linköping
sweden
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
whenever
i
come
across
it
i
usually
buy
two
or
three
bottles
and
drink
them
over
the
course
of
a
few
months
unless
greedy
guests
come
over
emptyhanded
and
thirsty
you
know
who
you
are
d
theres
no
way
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
fo
these
in
a
sitting
because
of
its
strong
alcohol
content
d
overall
i
do
like
this
beer
but
seems
a
little
thin
for
a
barley
wine
the
toffee
sweetness
makes
this
beer
drinkable
for
the
style
drinkability
at
12
this
is
certainly
a
one
a
done
but
a
good
one
and
done
thank
you
again
mikkeller
for
such
a
good
brew
on
tap
at
churchkey
in
washington
dc
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
served
beer
near
room
temperature
which
is
the
norm
at
churchkey
pours
an
opaque
caramel
brown
with
a
surprisingly
big
beige
head
that
recedes
slowly
leaving
streaks
of
lacing
and
legs
after
each
swirl
the
aroma
has
heavy
alcoholic
hops
than
i
was
expecting
with
a
biting
citrus
zing
and
plenty
of
underlying
caramel
malts
maybe
even
some
caramelized
esters
apples
as
well
the
taste
is
hefty
with
more
alcohol
burn
even
more
so
than
the
aroma
suggests
the
citrus
hops
are
there
but
give
way
to
the
massive
sugary
sweetness
of
the
malt
backbone
the
finish
has
a
serious
alcohol
burn
and
a
scathing
bitterness
both
of
which
limit
the
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
thick
almost
syrupy
but
with
a
ton
of
alcohol
this
is
a
massively
sweet
and
boozy
barleywine
that
is
definitely
not
the
most
drinkable
ive
had
in
the
style
abrasive
but
tasty
stuff
this
barleywine
is
definitely
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
opinion
well
overall
this
is
really
a
pretty
good
beer
so
i
have
been
pleasantly
surprised
that
said
i
dont
really
think
that
it
is
worth
the
price
you
pay
for
it
but
it
is
ready
to
drink
right
now
so
how
much
is
that
worth
to
you
most
barley
wines
especially
american
styles
are
green
as
heck
when
they
hit
the
shelves
so
you
have
to
let
them
sit
for
at
least
a
couple
years
before
they
stop
making
you
make
a
face
after
your
first
sip
this
beer
isnt
like
that
and
is
ready
now
not
having
to
wait
may
be
worth
the
6
to
8
more
a
bottle
that
you
are
paying
that
is
up
to
you
this
is
a
good
beer
and
one
that
is
worth
drinking
i
imagine
that
you
could
cellar
it
but
i
dont
think
that
it
would
do
much
for
it
oxidation
and
a
soy
saucelike
element
at
some
point
made
their
home
in
this
green
glass
bottle
the
hops
as
mention
earlier
have
also
seen
better
days
that
said
aging
this
beer
was
as
much
a
choice
as
it
was
a
necessity
in
hindsight
i
prefer
the
more
aggressive
more
severe
big
worse
to
this
more
passive
devitalized
version
then
again
in
hindsight
i
probably
wouldnt
have
forked
out
the
10
dollars
for
a
375ml
bottle
of
either
dvery
drinkable
taste
was
gone
in
no
time
d
over
all
i
love
it
i
recommend
sitting
on
it
in
the
right
atmosphere
for
at
least
a
year
looking
at
these
other
reviews
i
am
a
huge
barleywine
fan
and
this
made
my
expectations
not
to
hot
but
just
right
perfect
night
cap
d
for
12abv
this
is
a
very
approachable
beer
i
find
it
to
have
a
smooth
character
and
ended
up
drinking
it
quite
quickly
great
experience
not
detoured
by
mikkeller
at
all
i
would
just
question
the
conditions
this
bottle
had
been
in
from
its
birth
to
when
i
picked
it
off
the
shelf
medium
bodied
and
nicely
balanced
with
a
prominent
earthy
leathery
malt
character
there
are
some
silky
chocolate
and
toffee
notes
up
front
that
are
countered
by
a
subtle
hop
bitterness
and
a
very
strong
hot
boozy
alcohol
flavor
sweet
with
hints
of
chocolate
toffee
biscuit
and
caramel
but
again
the
alcohol
is
the
prominent
flavor
and
is
way
too
overpowering
d
its
a
pretty
solid
brew
maybe
a
bit
too
hot
and
slightly
all
over
the
place
but
id
go
to
say
with
a
bit
of
time
in
the
cellar
this
would
be
a
very
good
american
barleywine
drinkability
is
ok
definitely
a
sipper
big
beer
nice
on
a
cold
night
md
sipping
beer
perfect
for
a
cold
night
worth
a
try
mdseems
to
have
a
heavy
alcohol
bite
classic
barleywine
thickness
but
not
all
that
lively
in
my
mouth
a
touch
bitter
and
no
tingle
mikkeller
beers
tend
to
be
very
hit
or
miss
for
me
this
one
kind
of
falls
in
the
middle
all
in
all
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
bit
heavy
on
the
alc
flavor
but
it
doesnt
ruin
the
beer
worth
a
try
for
the
fans
of
mikkeller
and
the
fans
of
the
style
not
on
the
top
of
my
great
barleywines
list
im
not
sure
what
is
going
on
here
but
this
one
was
a
miss
overall
age
has
not
been
kind
to
this
brew
it
gets
slightly
bearable
as
it
warms
but
not
enough
to
even
think
about
finishing
my
glass
too
much
heat
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
very
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
several
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
12
7
ounce
caged
and
corked
bottle
the
bottle
is
at
least
a
year
old
so
it
does
have
some
age
on
it
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
murky
copperbrown
color
with
pretty
much
no
head
at
all
not
much
lacing
either
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
malty
it
smells
like
brown
sugar
dark
fruit
raisins
figs
and
caramel
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
dark
fruit
prunes
raisins
caramel
brown
sugar
piney
hops
and
booze
alcohol
is
still
a
bit
hot
maybe
i
should
have
aged
this
one
longer
mouthfeelbody
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
its
somewhat
slick
and
coating
with
lowmoderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
it
would
be
better
if
the
alcohol
heat
wasnt
so
noticable
in
the
taste
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
a
brownish
cherryred
brew
with
a
small
tan
head
that
sinks
back
into
the
brew
quickly
and
leaves
a
smattering
of
lace
smells
of
plums
raisins
cherries
and
caramel
malts
a
sweet
and
sour
breadiness
exists
tastes
big
on
the
caramel
malts
with
a
nice
hit
of
piny
hops
striking
immediately
afterward
with
some
wellblended
dark
fruits
at
the
end
the
alcohol
heat
is
evident
but
mixes
well
and
is
never
overbearing
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
goes
down
creamy
near
spoton
with
this
one
jd
d
very
drinkable
for
a
12
abv
brew
very
tasty
with
some
nice
characteristics
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
17
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
poor
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
sweet

hint
of
tart
malt
slight
citrus
slight

slight
woodyearthiness
and
alcohol
fits
the
style
of
an
american
barleywine
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
alcohol
roasted
malt
slight
sweet
malt

slight

and
a
hint
of

lacking
in

better
in

and
blend
2007
vintage
pours
a
murky
brown
without
too
much
head
or
lacing
smells
of
brown
sugar
dried
fruit
and
caramel
malt
fairly
boozy
in
the
flavour
but
still
lots
of
sweetness
not
much
bitterness
but
that
may
have
faded
with
the
aging
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
thin
poured
into
a
small
whiskey
glass
small
head
with
a
hazey
ruby
coloreed
body
no
light
permitted
to
make
it
through
the
aroma
is
of
unferemented
sugars
and
plum
fruit
the
taste
is
complete
unferemented
sugars
they
overpower
everything
it
tastes
like
someone
tried
to
add
as
much
ferementables
into
this
brew
but
didnt
have
enough
fire
power
with
the
yeast
to
get
the
finish
this
is
the
first
i
have
tried
from
mikkeller
and
im
not
looking
to
try
anything
else
from
him
soon
d
it
was
pretty
drinkable
for
a
12abv
barleywine
but
i
think
the
smokey
character
might
have
been
out
of
place
well
if
it
was
intentional
then
the
beer
was
above
average
across
the
board
notes
damn
good
mouthfeel
suffers
from
lack
of
carbonation
but
flavors
are
all
right
up

alcohol
is
well
handled
as
is
the
palate
overall
a
nice
beer
just
lacks
some
of
the
finesse
of
other
barleywines
ive
had
did
i
miss
big
bad
dry
bitterness
accompanying
a
slight
oral
coating

little

on

taste
is
an
assault
of

heat
upfront
with
hop
bitterness
and
a
punch
of

notes
thy
finishes
with
more

warmth
and
citrus

heavy
feel
with
a
very
low

level
quite
a
good

with
an

i
am
uncertain
if
the
21712
date
was
a
best
by
date
it
surely
could
be
cellared
at
least
that
long
to
let
that

taste
mellow
out

an

with

bitterness
a
bit
hot
at

with
an
alcohol
burn
that
is
a

distracting
merlin48apr

and
pretty
damned
good
at

for
375ml
however
tasting
like
burn
pitted

its
also
a
bit
on
the
sour
side
i
also
detect
apricot
perhaps
i
am
really
digging
this
english
style
barley
wine
as
i
seem
to
enjoy
the
sweetness
versus
the
hop
onslaught
you
get
from
the
american
barleywines
overall
for
an
american
version
i
will
give
their
other
brews
a
shot
mouthfeel
is
astringent
in
every
aspect
coats
the
palate
with
earthy
hop
oils
but
it
doesnt
line
up
exactly
for
me
what
ever
it
is
also
lingers
some
and
i
just
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
the
best
that
i
can
do
is
say
that
the
alcohol
burn
might
be
stepping
on
the
sweeter

of
the

give
it
a
higher
rating
but
im
not
thrilled
with
the
slight
apricot
flavor
probably
just
they
hops
theyre
using
but
with
a
few
slow
and
small
bubbles
of
carbonation
in
the
nose
but
back
to
back
sips
seem
to
magnify
the
effects
of
the
hot
alcohol
on
the
flavor
in
the

this
show
lots
of

as
i

clear
and
biting
alcohol
that
all
lead
into
a
drying
finish
with
a
malty
and
caramel
sweet
aftertaste
a
good
barleywine
that
got
better
farther
into
it
grapefruit
rind
but
a
solid
beer
its
obviously
not
for
your
average
monday
morning
session
with
the
boys
a
remarkably
well
put
together
brew
super
hoppy
nice
dizzying
effect
good
sipper
not
a
daily
drinker
heavy
and
the
alcohol
hits
heavy
it
is
nice
that
they
have
released
this
in
12oz
bottles
now
as
it
is
much
more
manageable
to
have
one
with
another
lighter
beer
sweet
aroma
with
a
hint
of
floral
notes
this
beer
slaps
you
right
in
the
face
absolutely
massive
beer
pretty
maltheavy
in
my
opinion
id
like
to
have
one
thats
beer
aged
for
a
while
and
see
how
that
affects
it
very
boozy
beer
this
is
a
bit
too
bitter
for
my
taste
just
a
little
stronger
than
i
like
my
beer
but
i
can
see
why
some
people
love
it
pretty
good
beer
love
barleywines
but
this
was
a
little
too
hopped
for
what
i
expected
had
young
would
have
been
better
w
some
age
on
it
cellar
this
one
overall
i
bought
this
beer
for
its
cellar
strength
i
can
definitely
see
how
this
would
improve
over
the
next
few
years
i
have
7
more
and
will
update
this
in
a
few
months
o
nice
and
hoppy
cant
wait
to
see
it
with
some
age
an
amazing
beer
mahogany
in
color
one
finger
head
sweet
malty
and
subtle
boozy
smell
taste
is
subtle
hops
at
first
then
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
heat
but
not
intense
served
at
almost
room
temperature
this
was
a
very
good
beer
and
my
first
barleywine
an
incredible
beer
one
of
my
favorites
i
have
the
2013
and
im
buying
the
14
and
15
soon
to
do
a
tasting
only
gets
better
with
age
this
is
a
very
good
ipa
but
to
my
taste
buds
its
really
not
a
barleywine
ive
had
2015
on
draft
and
it
wasnt
as
good
as
this
2014
bottle
very
sweet
malt
up
front
with
a
piney
hop
boozy
back
end
just
an
awesome
american
style
barleywine
overall
a
very
good
barleywine
despite
how
hopped
it
is
even
though
the
ops
are
strong
the
taste
is
not
bad
and
the
strong
malts
do
help
take
the
edge
off
little
served
in
an
oversized
wine
glass
o
a
big
beer
full
of
flavor
and
everything
that
makes
this
brew
one
of
the
quintessential
american
style
barleywines
fantastic
pricing
and
availability
too
ive
been
getting
more
into
barleywines
lately
it
never
used
to
be
a
style
i
enjoyed
but
my
palate
has
evolved
to
enjoy
them
much
more
this
one
however
did
not
leave
me
particularly
impressed
mostly
sweet
but
not
with
any
real
flavor
behind
it
everything
blended
into
an
amalgam
that
rather
than
being
balanced
was
simply
dull
i
can
more
easily
forgive
a
beer
being
outright
bad
than
i
can
dull
big
and
boozy
more
subtle
than
english
barley
wine
in
my
limited
experience
with
this
style
overall
not
bad
i
got
two
of
these
gonna
cellar
the
other
brought
two
one
to
drink
fresh
and
one
to
cellar
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
more
hoppy
than
i
like
my
barleywines
opened
a
2013
tonight
and
it
was
well
worth
the
wait
smooth
deep
auburn
with
thin
off
white
head
aromas
of
bourbon
barrel
staves
semi
sweet
malt
as
liquid
warms
bourbon
and
boozy
malt
with
burnt
hop
finish
intense
medium
mouthfeel
tongue
tingles
with
alcohol
and
bittering
coating
overall
tastes
a
little
lite
like
it
needs
time
but
still
big
and
boozy
nice
looks
fine
with
good
aroma
taste
is
widely
unbalanced
my
first
sn
that
i
can
say
i
wont
touch
again
barley
wine
in
name
ipa
in
nature
light
amber
color
with
thick
lasting
head
much
lacing
full
cabonation
sharp
impact
of
fresh
hops
pine
crisp
after
taste
interested
in
how
age
would
change
it
flavor
this
was
a
2014
bottle
aged
roughly
1
year
each
year
still
had
plenty
of
carbonation
mostly
pine
citrus
hops
with
a
little
backsplash
of
toasted
malt
not
picking
up
any
of
the
sweetness
or
fruit
that
others
have
it
is
a
good
punchy
mix
of
the
two
primary
beer
flavors
but
thats
about
it
deep
red
in
color
everlasting
lace
sweet
orange
and
floral
hop
scents
sweet
cherry
and
earthy
bittering
hops
finishes
dry
with
strength
this
beer
takes
you
on
an
adventure
overwhelming
hops
if
you
like
it
so
bitter
that
the
taste
and
feel
are
overpowered
then
maybe
this
is
for
you
bit
not
for
me
i
could
have
sworn
i
rated
this
years
ago
but
apparently
not
i
chose
to
drink
a
fresh
one
to
rate
instead
of
an
aged
bottle
i
get
some
malt
in
the
nose
with
a
hoppy
edge
to
it
taste
swaps
malt
for
the
initial
blast
of
earthy
dank
hops
which
gives
way
to
sweetness
once
the
malt
comes
around
virtually
no
heat
on
it
while
drinking
or
during
finish
this
is
probably
once
of
the
most
balanced
beers
ive
had
so
far
its
incredibly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
for
9
6
hell
im
on
my
second
one
and
i
just
finished
my
dinner
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
sierra
nevada
but
this
is
my
first
go
at
their
seasonal
releases
i
bought
1
fourpack
now
the
only
choice
is
to
finish
this
glass
and
cellar
the
other
two
or
finish
it
off
and
cellar
another
4
pack
outstanding
beer
the
beer
is
good
dont
get
me
wrong
but
this
isnt
something
one
person
should
drink
this
would
ideally
be
split
between
two
people
not
because
of
the
abv
but
because
of
thickness
it
has
tons
of
flavor
but
drinking
an
entire
bottle
can
be
a
bit
tiring
on
the
palate
i
would
pair
this
with
a
spicy
beef
chili
it
gets
a
87100
2014
is
much
better
with
age
and
brings
a
great
depth
of
flavor
id
give
it
a
4
50
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
beer
that
should
serve
as
part
of
the
new
standard
for
an
american
barleywine
style
ale
the
hop
profile
on
this
is
simply
divine
whether
you
are
drinking
a
fresh
batch
beer
or
one
that
has
aged
in
the
cellar
for
23
years
if
does
have
minor
variation
for
each
vintage
year
my
favorite
so
far
being
circa
2012
but
it
is
consistently
excellent
while
these
are
no
longer
sold
in
6packs
and
they
are
a
bit
pricey
it
is
certainly
worth
the
cost
to
buy
a
couple
of
4packs
drink
23
now
and
cellar
the
rest
to
see
how
they
develop
with
age
i
just
did
not
like
this
beer
the
booze
wasnt
even
slightly
masked
and
the
mouthfeel
was
so
heavy
i
felt
like
an
anvil
was
going
down
my
throat
maybe
barleywine
isnt
my
thing
but
i
love
all
of
sierra
nevadas
other
beers
my
first
favorite
barley
wine
i
have
refined
my
palate
slowly
hoppy
not
super
sweet
it
really
is
filling
i
find
a
few
other
barley
wines
better
but
the
baers
really
like
thin
one
and
i
know
why
i
think
i
just
drank
to
much
of
a
good
thing
and
became
a
little
sick
of
it
overall
really
good
if
you
like
the
barley
wines
which
i
do
something
beyond
the
hops
rolling
around
in
there
some
different
heavier
kind
of
bitter
with
more
body
poured
in
my
snifter
glass
minimal
head
with
a
dark
burnt
orange
color
lacing
on
the
glass
with
a
few
floaties
getting
caramel
on
the
nose
wow
not
what
i
was
expecting
as
barleywines
are
too
sweet
for
me
the
hops
come
thru
followed
by
a
little
sweetness
on
the
backend
smooth
the
alcohol
wasnt
over
powering
im
getting
a
couple
more
to
cellar
this
is
a
hoppy
and
has
a
somewhat
sweet
note
you
can
surely
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
one
im
sure
with
time
this
beer
will
get
better
im
glad
i
purchased
a
number
of
these
and
cant
wait
to
enjoy
one
with
some
age
on
it
tempestuous
of
late
has
been
the
climate
as
has
been
my
mood
and
palette
subsequently
i
approached
this
brew
with
a
great
deal
of
trepidation
indeed
my
caution
was
warranted
removing
the
cap
i
was
met
wish
a
noisome
aroma
of
an
intoxicating
and
noxious
potion
that
would
be
best
served
to
sate
the
throat
of
the
damned
the
putrid
caustic
color
belies
a
serum
of
the
most
unholy
and
wicked
disposition
i
cannot
fathom
for
the
life
of
me
why
anyone
would
want
to
consume
something
which
so
closely
resembles
the
embodiment
of
pure
black
evil
waxing
philosophical
one
can
only
think
of
the
bleakest
nihilism
while
attempting
to
toss
back
a
bottle
of
this
repugnant
liquid
for
it
is
when
we
are
out
our
lowest
that
we
can
shine
our
brightest
so
to
does
a
beer
like
this
remind
us
of
why
we
are
alive
and
that
we
should
avoid
this
type
of
masochistic
debauchery

this

is
the
best
ive
ever
had
no
but
this
one
although
i
drink
it
rarely
is
nostalgic
for
me
it
was
the
first
beer
i
ever
bought
that
made
me
want
to
start
cellaring
beer
and
for
that
this
beer
will
always
have
a
special
place
on
my
shelf
aging
away
wow
i
love
this
i
have
limited
experience
with
barley
wines
but
this
is
already
a
favorite
i
can
hardly
wait
to
see
how
this
develops
over
time
if
i
can
keep
my
hands
off
what
i
store
away
i
will
definitely
be
buying
at
least
1
more
4
pack
especially
at
a
10
00
price
point
tasty
tasty
tasty
too
hoppy
for
a
barley
wine
imo
2013
vintage
of
the
bigfoot
barleywine
yes
i
believe
in
bigfoot
218
pours
cloudy
amber
rusty
heavy
white
foam
with
high
retention
malty
nose
toffee
caramel
too
taste
is
a
puckering
astringent
barleywine
heavy
bitter
sharp
pine
taste
never
lets
go
people
like
these
i
just
dont
overall
this
is
one
that
can
age
with
time
could
use
mor
ed
time
in
the
cellar
but
draft
is
hard
to
store
st
most
bars
due
to
room
i
always
like
to
throw
sd
one
of
these
in
the
beer
cellars
for
future
years
too
this
is
a
classic
hopped
up
american
style
barleywine
big
rich
in
your
face
flavors
i
tend
to
prefer
the
milder
english
barleywines
and
suspect
ill
like
this
better
with
612
months
of
age
drank
this
brew
right
after
a
very
dark
and
rich
stout
it
held
its
own
in
the
taste
category
would
have
been
better
if
i
did
not
drink
the
stout
before
it
overall
i
expected
a
stronger
malt
presence
for
the
style
otherwise
a
well
done
beer
lots
of
hops
not
an
expert
on
barleywines
but
this
one
had
a
taste
that
was
good
but
not
great
for
me
thirsty
dog
makes
one
too
and
i
think
i
like
theirs
better
amazing
burgundy
color
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
with
peaks
smell
was
slightly
lacking
erhaps
from
just
getting
over
a
cold
but
i
get
hints
of
peat
oak
and
a
slight
plum
or
could
just
be
alcohol
taste
was
an
amazing
whirlwind
of
toffee
caramel
oak
toast
bread
crust
and
an
orange
hint
of
hops
that
finishes
with
a
big
alcoholic
kick
mouth
feel
was
a
bit
thick
overall
very
good
tasting
beer
you
wont
be
disappointed
this
is
the
2015
barleywine
and
i
can
only
imagine
when
it
was
brewed
tastes
as
if
it
was
already
aged
for
a
year
these
guys
are
on
top
of
their
shit
the
beer
is
a
cheap
barleywine
for
a
world
class
beer
would
definitely
pick
up
another
pack
a
fresh
2015
bottle
pours
a
dark
copper
red
with
a
foamy
head
hot
damn
this
smells
delicious
floral
smell
is
overpowering
you
can
almost
smell
the
alcohol
too
the
taste
is
a
drop
kick
to
your
senses
sweet
up
front
and
bitter
on
the
back
end
big
and
chewy
cant
wait
to
start
aging
some
of
these
it
took
a
bite
out
of
my
taste
buds
the
first
time
i
sipped
this
exceptional
barley
wine
felt
like
a
long
roast
in
my
mouth
shes
a
beauty
to
look
at
with
a
copper
color
and
a
thick
offwhite
head
the
alcohol
is
present
on
both
the
smell
and
taste
the
smell
is
a
mix
of
floral
and
fruity
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
this
seems
to
be
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
didnt
really
wow
me
i
had
this
one
less
than
2
months
after
bottling
date
so
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
it
changes
with
some
age
popped
open
a
2012
cant
get
past
how
amazing
this
beers
smells
floral
and
fruity
beyond
my
initial
expectations
hops
are
subdued
as
one
would
expect
and
a
nice
heat
develops
at
the
end
solid
beer
overall
i
just
cant
get
enough
of
this
brew
when
it
comes
out
every
year
really
diggin
it
o
very
good
barleywine
and
very
drinkable
a
great
place
to
start
if
you
are
new
to
this
style
not
overly
crazy
about
this
wow
this
is
impressive
so
much
flavor
starts
sweet
like
a
belgian
but
finishes
a
bit
like
an
ipa
a
special
beer
very
smooth
hides
the
high
abv
well
would
like
to
buy
a
couple
more
to
age
amazing
brew
great
balance
between
hops
and
rich
alcohol
flavors
with
a
silky
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
and
deceptively
sweet
for
the
potency
great
introduction
to
barleywines
for
me
and
my
new
favorite
from
sierra
nevada
well
worth
the
price
even
in
a
four
pack
if
i
could
take
it
overseas
i
would
love
to
let
some
age
for
a
few
years
but
something
tells
me
customs
might
not
be
down
with
that
drink
it
slow
and
savor
it
because
its
very
easy
to
put
back
quickly
think
torpedo
with
less
pungency
and
more
sweetness
and
extra
smoothness
will
probably
spend
far
more
money
than
i
honestly
should
on
this
one
good
strong
bitterness
but
a
little
sweet
for
me
and
only
gets
sweeter
towards
the
end
love
barley
wines
but
really
despise
pine
tree
flavored
hops
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
brownorange
color
with
a
white
head
nose
is
toffee
hops
and
alcohol
taste
follows
with
toffee
hops
alcohol
a
bittersweet
flavor
really
mouthfeel
is
medium
overall
a
nice
barleywine
my
favorite
so
far
especially
for
a
style
im
still
getting
used
to
smokey
and
bitter
taste
the
alcohol
this
is
good
good
good
overall
such
a
easily
attainable
world
class
barleywine
i
really
appreciate
how
hopforward
it
is
and
leads
to
great
changes
with
age
overall
still
quite
a
bit
of
hop
character
and
bitterness
despite
2
years
of
age
nice
example
of
the
style
pours
an
amber
honey
color
with
a
thin
one
finger
head
it
smells
sweet
like
toffee
and
honey
there
is
a
strong
hop
presence
on
the
nose
as
well
the
flavor
is
heavy
similar
to
the
nose
but
with
a
smokiness
and
a
heavy
bitterness
at
the
end
my
favorite
part
if
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
its
very
thick
and
creamy
overall
had
this
for
the
first
time
last
year
and
didnt
know
quite
what
to
make
of
it
suffice
to
say
my
palate
has
developed
and
i
think
this
is
a
damn
fine
brew
id
put
it
alongside
lukcy
basartd
in
sheer
kickassery
though
this
is
a
bit
tamer
2014

into
a
14
oz

that
signature

hoppyness
very
glad
to
have
found
a
few
four
packs
of
this
its
extremely
enjoyable
and
certainly
worthy
of
a

a
barleywine
can
offer

at

if
you
can
acquire
this
sought

delicacy
i
love
this
beer
every
thing
about
it
just
works
for
me
nice
hoppy
aroma
very
dark
malt
flavor
with
a
nice
hint
of
chocolate
not
too
overwhelming
with
the
alcohol
content
conclusion
an
excellent
beer
at
any
age
from
05
years
and
at
any
time
of
the
year
fantastic
a
friend
recommended
this
also
as
an
intro
to
american
barleywine
and
it
did
not
disappoint
my
first
and
it
will
not
be
my
last
vertical
tasting
20112014
great
vertical
can
really
taste
the
difference
the
aging
makes
2011
is
very
smooth
o
nice
smooth
and
enjoyable
strong
pronounced
flavors
youd
expect
from
an
american
style
barley
wine
decent
head
which
dissipated
pretty
quick
colour
is
a
gorgeous
redbrown
smell
is
nicely
aromatic
of
piney
hops
which
i
assume
will
fade
with
years
its
a
nice
drinkable
mix
of
syrupy
pruneplum
with
a
hop
bite
there
is
a
dry
finish
and
the
alcohol
isnt
evident
beyond
the
body
and
the
sweetness
its
not
fair
to
compare
this
to
aged
other
barley
wines
some
of
said
its
a
good
intro
to
barley
wines
and
i
wouldnt
disagree
but
that
should
not
under
cut
how
enjoyable
it
is
as
a
fine
balanced
beer
excellent
hoppiness
rare
for
a
barleywine
but
oh
so
preferred
still
a
very
solid
beer
always
a
pleasure
from
sierra
nevada
rich
red
sweet
light
piney
hops
mulled
wine
aftertaste
beneath
the
bitterness
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
strong
fruity
and
enough
hoppy
bite
to
even
out
the
fruit
wonderful
beer
all
around
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
2009
vintage
at
an
old
beer
tasting
i
have
a
5
gallon
keg
of
this
in
my
kegerator
and
it
is
great
the
head
on
this
is
really
cool
the
creamiest
i
have
ever
seen
high
abv
but
mostly
hidden
from
all
the
flavor
overall
i
was
excited
to
see
sierra
nevada
with
a
barleywine
styled
ale
hoping
it
would
be
along
the
same
quality
as
their
narwhal
stout
i
brought
home
the
4pack
honestly
im
disappointed
the
hop
character
was
too
obvious
and
strong
for
my
liking
there
was
no
sweetness
that
i
tend
to
be
used
to
with
barleywines
roasted
malts
gave
me
an
inkling
of
hope
but
they
couldnt
shine
through
enough
due
to
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
oh
well
ya
win
some
ya
lose
some
overall
a
really
tasty
beer
barleywines
are
usually
not
my
thing
but
this
is
really
good
glad
to
have
a
few
put
aside
to
age
packs
a
punch
consistent
through
the
years
beautiful
deep
malt
full
bodied
robust
and
smooth
the
2014
release
is
nothing
if
not
just
as
good
as
their
previous
editions
sits
well
too
i
just
recently
opened
one
of
the
1999s
i
had
in
my
cellar
and
it
was
a
life
altering
event
bottle
ages
very
well
flavors
matured
to
add
a
nice
chocolatecoffee
punch
with
little
to
no
acidity
to
report
on
the
finish
enjoy
a
few
now
but
i
highly
recommend
you
set
a
few
aside
to
age
time
does
this
beer
very
well
barley
wine
really
isnt
my
thing
so
take
it
for
what
its
worth
seems
like
a
quality
though
overall
this
is
an
interesting
and
complex
barleywine
ale
overall
although
i
enjoyed
this
brew
i
cant
say
it
was
enough
to
sway
me
over
the
pond
toward
preference
for
american
barleywines
i
would
still
choose
an
english
style
barleywine
english
style
barleywines
are
more
well
rounded
and
balanced
than
their
american
counterparts
american
barleywines
are
more
akin
to
malty
ipas
but
hey
whatever
floats
your
boat
i
suppose
i
would
definitely
try
this
one
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
it
out
needless
to
say
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
cellaring
didnt
detract
from
it
a
bit
i
would
recommend
it
for
a
sunday
afternoon
when
the
barrel
aged
would
be
over
the
top
outstanding
beer
to
sip
on
a
cool
fall
night
so
much
complexity
good
balance
of
lots
of
malt
and
hop
flavor
o
even
for
an
american
barley
wine
this
is
extremely
hopforward
more
than
can
come
close
to
mellowing
in
six
month
im
reading
randy
moshers
tasting
beer
right
now
and
he
talks
about
cellaring
these
for
at
least
five
years
i
think
hes
on
to
something
its
an
excellent
beer
with
tons
of
great
malt
flavor
but
i
think
its
really
too
aggressive
when
fresh
even
though
thats
the
intention
its
a
good
beer
for
hopheads
as
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
dominated
by
extremely
piny
hops
id
prefer
a
little
more
balance
though
and
the
malt
takes
a
major
backseat
in
this
brew
i
started
to
notice
an
increasingly
bready
yeast
flavor
emerging
as
i
worked
my
way
through
the
glass
but
the
hops
remained
the
star
player
rating
b
amber
color
medium
offwhite
head
hoppy
aroma
with
hint
of
caramel
malt
malt
pine
tropical
fruits
in
taste
long
dry
and
bitter
aftertaste
great
4050
monster
of
a
beer
huge
malt
character
and
mega
hopped
o
fantastic
beer
really
explodes
in
your
mouth
up
front
and
i
loved
the
nice
bitter
tangy
finish
overall
a
good
beer
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
traditional
barleywine
outstanding
just
opened
a
2006
bottle
this
being
2014
that
makes
it
a
little
more
than
8
years
old
i
took
notes
on
the
first
bottle
of
this
i
opened
in
2006
and
thought
it
was
a
lesser
year
it
was
very
astringent
and
overly
dry
those
8
years
really
added
some
character
dang
the
caramel
flavors
are
much
more
pronounced
and
the
astringent
flavors
are
all
completely
gone
i
am
so
glad
i
didnt
plow
through
this
case
and
have
about
9
left
i
have
a
2004
that
was
still
good
but
probably
not
as
good
as
the
previous
years
tasting
so
i
am
guessing
around
8
years
in
the
cellar
is
the
optimal
aging
time
for
this
barleywine
your
mileage
may
vary
a
hard
style
of
beer
to
get
in
pa
and
this
is
the
best
one
get
here
albeit
seasonal
very
complex
caramel
and
rich
fruit
great
price
point
also
for
a
barleywine
o
this
is
my
favorite
sn
overall
this
is
a
classic
after
chasing
this
around
san
diego
back
in
1996
it
is
still
as
good
as
when
we
used
to
hunt
it
down
i
am
glad
this
sits
around
on
shelves
longer
than
most
i
dont
really
love
the
hop
inclusion
food
match
the
heavy
body
of
this
beer
really
makes
it
more
of
an
afterdinner
brew
however
if
you
were
going
to
attempt
it
with
food
then
you
need
a
bold
spicy
cuisine
like
a
thai
with
a
light
body
to
counteract
any
bloat
such
as
a
green
papaya
salad
with
chopped
red
chilli
o
very
good
beer
this
is
a
re
review
with
an
aged
bottle
for
a
couple
months
d
overall
solid
barleywine
definitely
one
of
the
better
brews
i
have
had
in
this
style
o
prefer
this
aged
version
than
the
fresh
one
but
will
see
what
the
other
2013
i
have
tastes
like
in
a
year
i
hope
some
of
those
rum
raisin
notes
come
out
in
the
flavor
that
said
this
a
very
good
american
barleywine
that
is
easy
to
find
and
cheap
2014
version
is
out
and
im
still
able
to
find
4packs
of
2013
o
lots
to
like
with
this
palate
buster
this
is
the
third
bottle
of
the
four
pack
that
i
have
had
not
all
tonight
and
each
one
has
kicked
my
ass
this
is
a
beer
to
sip
and
savor
for
sure
the
quality
in
the
entire
lineup
of
sierra
nevada
beers
not
just
this
one
is
impressive
i
cant
remember
the
last
time
i
had
something
by
them
that
i
did
not
enjoy
can
you
handle
it
this
one
poured
out
with
a
solid
head
which
fought
hard
to
such
around
eventually
reducing
to
a
thin
top
cover
with
pretty
good
lacing
heavy
malts
with
caramel
and
a
bit
of
floral
notes
after
several
tastes
not
bad
but
nothing
special
to
me
well
see
how
it
cellars
brownish
ruby
colour
one
finger
of
off
white
head
some
lace
smell
is
of
dank
piney
hops
juicy
citrus
with
a
sweet
caramelmalty
secondary
the
hops
are
really
the
star
of
the
show
here
taste
is
full
of
pine
and
dank
hoppy
flavours
right
away
spicy
malty
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
but
in
terms
of
barleywine
i
would
say
this
is
quite
dry
bitter
hop
aftertaste
medium
carbonation
full
chewey
body
this
was
really
good
perhaps
the
fastest
drinking
barleywine
i
have
ever
had
i
could
probably
have
a
couple
of
these
in
an
evening
with
no
complaints
best
enjoyed
fresh
as
this
was
this
is
a
great
and
relatively
easy
beer
to
find
i
love
this
barleywine
because
it
carries
the
sweet
malty
taste
to
start
and
transforms
into
a
velvety
alcoholy
and
ibu
lover
friendly
flavor
compilation
top
three
favorite
ales
of
this
style
and
the
price
is
not
insane
overall
this
is
a
great
hoppy
barleywine
actually
reminds
me
of
arrogant
bastard
in
some
ways
although
the
malt
is
less
nutty
than
a
strong
ale
spot
on
for
the
style
without
breaking
the
rules
this
is
a
great
barleywine
hands
down
the
hops
definitely
make
it
such
that
it
could
be
mistaken
for
a
double
ipa
but
this
only
serves
to
add
to
the
experience
not
detract
from
it
i
just
wonder
how
this
would
taste
after
a
year
or
so
i
will
keep
buying
this
one
as
long
as
it
is
available
overall
4

this
is
a
barley
wine
style
beer
but
it
is
not
a
barley
wine
i
am
going
against
the
rules
here
and
following
in
the
footsteps
of
many
others
and
grading
this
beer
on
its
own
merits
rather
than
its
adherence
to
style
this
beer
is
big
in
abv
but
is
just
perfectly
balanced
and
so
satisfying
to
drink
hoppy
malty
and
a
joy
in
every
characteristic
that
a
beer
should
be
this
baby
is
dangerously
sessionable
dont
drink
too
many
or
you
too
may
see
ol
sasquatch
lurking
outside
your
window
o
good
beer
for
sure
but
it
tastes
like
a
dipa
to
me
overall
id
get
this
anytime
one
minor
beef
was
that
it
arrived
a
lot
colder
than
it
should
have
had
to
leave
it
for
a
while
to
warm
up
mf
long
finish
sharp
and
drying
o
like
liquor
for
beer
drinkers
it
is
just
straight
up
alcohol
flavor
i
will
try
a
different
one
in
thiis
variety
but
if
they
are
the
same
then
this
isnt
for
me
2014
vintage
the
beer
pours
a
deep
candied
ruby
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
borders
on
the
color
of
white
sand
and
has
a
mild
retention
as
the
head
goes
it
leaves
a
thick
blanket
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
beers
body
is
deep
in
color
but
clear
and
rather
translucent
even
in
its
darkness
when
i
splash
the
beer
against
my
glass
it
leaves
the
briefest
of
alcoholic
legs
hinting
at
the
booze
within
it
as
a
whole
the
beer
is
quite
nice
on
the
eyes
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
like
an
oldschool
dipa
damply
piney
with
a
strong
caramel
malt
shiver
running
up
the
nostrils
to
suggest
toffee
as
it
opens
up
i
start
to
get
hints
of
plum
and
prune
in
the
malt
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
initially
of
hop
bitters
mostly
of
the
pine
variety
the
middle
of
the
sip
sees
a
touch
boozy
heat
and
towards
the
finish
the
bitters
are
greeted
by
a
powerful
burst
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
which
bends
this
beer
back
towards
balance
boozy
heat
and
sweetness
return
on
the
finish
combining
to
intensify
the
afterfeel
of
bitterness
in
the
mouth
in
flavor
this
beer
begins
with
a
fresh
burst
of
sticky
pine
resin
moving
slowly
towards
fresh
pine
needles
and
bitter
medicine
this
medicinal
bitterness
slowly
blends
into
an
ooiegooey
caramel
and
toffee
sweetness
the
transition
bring
hints
of
brown
sugarcoated
plums
and
prunes
alongside
solventlike
alcoholic
heat
the
finish
sees
a
beautiful
burst
of
caramel
bread
that
has
me
looking
forward
to
the
things
to
come
the
aftertaste
is
decidedly
bitter
with
pine
sap
and
medicine
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
full
bodied
with
a
sticky
chewy
mouthfeel
a
middling
carbonation
and
a
definite
tingle
on
the
tongue
that
could
be
coming
from
the
alcohol
or
from
hidden
acidity
the
sides
of
the
tongue
are
shocked
with
bitterbite
once
the
beer
has
left
the
mouth
and
the
mouth
as
a
whole
is
left
dry
except
for
the
far
extremities
which
pool
spittle
overall
fresh
bigfoot
tastes
like
a
boozy
dipa
in
todays
world
its
hot
its
hoppy
and
its
got
a
nice
balancing
malt
that
finishes
quite
elegantly
and
lets
you
know
this
is
an
american
barleywine
admittedly
im
more
fond
of
the
english
barleywines
but
this
is
a
classic
of
the
american
style
and
has
some
nice
complexity
to
it
this
beer
is
a
classic
for
a
reason
and
should
not
be
missed
dont
drink
this
beer
too
cold
or
you
will
miss
out
i
drank
mine
slowly
and
enjoyed
the
complexities
that
i
picked
up
as
the
beer
warmed
up
a
bit
i
love
how
the
sweetness
is
well
balanced
with
a
hoppy
punch
this
is
an
impressive
balance
for
a
big
beer
surprisingly
drinkable
o
my
first
americanstyle
barleywine
hmm
again
the
alcohol
is
pretty
strong
and
the
bitterness
bites
even
when
aged
a
year
and
a
bit
so
this
ones
a
sipper
but
its
a
tasty
brew
looking
forward
to
aging
this
more
o
awesome
barley
wine
especially
for
the
price
will
look
forward
to
this
one
year
after
year
overall
4

overall
great
beer
sierra
nevadas
high
altitude
series
is
one
of
my
favorite
cant
wait
to
try
hoptimum
i
have
had
narwhal
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
bigfoot
is
great
going
to
pick
up
another
four
pack
to
age
and
sample
with
the
next
few
releases
o
lives
up
to
expectations
definitely
on
the
hoppy
end
of
the
spectrum
for
the
style
but
imho
thats
one
of
the
most
important
features
that
separates
american
barleywines
from
english
barleywines
o
less
barleywine
in
flavor
and
more
of
a
lesstropicalmorecaramel
double
or
triple
ipa
after
getting
over
the
slight
disappointment
on
the
first
sip
despite
knowing
that
this
wasnt
going
to
be
a
typical
barleywine
and
expecting
a
lot
of
hops
im
surprised
at
how
good
this
is
overall
a
good
beer
love
that
its
got
such
a
hoppy
flavor
just
wish
the
alcohol
was
hidden
a
bit
better
overall
this
is
probably
both
one
of
the
most
unique
ales
ive
yet
to
try
as
well
as
the
most
bitter
the
bitterness
was
actually
a
bit
overwhelming
during
my
first
exposure
but
ive
accommodated
it
as
part
of
this
ales
unique
character
this
is
definitely
a
strong
beer
boasting
a
9
6
abv
this
is
definitely
something
youll
want
to
relish
in
gradually
if
you
wish
to
enjoy
its
character
what
i
was
a
bit
skeptical
of
at
first
is
now
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
folks
over
at
sierra
nevada
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
overall
certainly
one
of
my
recent
favorites
and
potentially
my
favorite
sn
the
celebration
coming
in
a
close
second
for
the
relatively
good
price
theres
no
way
to
go
wrong
with
the
big
foot
edit

im
not
going
to
rescore
this
but
i
am
now
comparing
a
13
month
old
bigfoot
to
a
2
month
old
the
newer
one
is
much
pricklier
more
herbal
hop
bitterness
older
beer
has
for
sure
mellowed
out
much
creamier
seems
a
bit
sweeter
too
vintage
2014
pours
a
deep
dark
reddish
amber
thin
light
head
remains
briefly
withdrawing
to
sparse
bubbles
on
the
surface
smell
is
actually
much
hoppier
than
i
was
expecting
and
there
is
very
noticeable
booze
on
the
nose
some
dark
fruits
and
brown
sugar
come
through
too
as
for
taste
the
biggest
thing
i
noticed
is
that
while
there
is
certainly
still
some
molasses
sweetness
this
is
one
of
the
drier
barley
wines
that
i
have
had
caramel
plum
hops
and
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
but
not
sticky
and
overly
heavy
like
some
barleywines
can
be
low
carbonation
overall
a
great
barleywine
one
of
the
more
drinkable
ive
ever
had
lots
of
hop
character
and
not
overly
sweet
only
real
complaint
is
that
it
is
a
bit
boozey
im
sure
some
aging
would
deal
with
that
nicely
definately
a
winner
and
very
enjoyable
will
come
back
to
time
and
again
and
it
wont
let
you
down
my
all
time
favorite
beer
from
my
all
time
favorite
brewery
if
i
can
find
it
in
the
store
im
hoarding
it
the
aroma
taste
mouthfeel
and
look
are
perfection
specifically
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
candy
with
a
wonderful
piney
bitter
finish
that
tops
it
off
the
alcohol
is
there
but
it
does
not
overpower
the
hops
and
malt
i
was
a
little
disappointed
that
it
went
from
a
6
pack
to
a
4
pack
but
i
can
appreciate
the
business
sense
of
this
i
do
wish
production
and
distribution
would
increase
i
could
find
this
product
easily
in
the
past
but
suddenly
its
become
difficult
to
find
apparently
the
cat
is
out
of
the
bag
now
o
very
easy
to
see
how
this
can
age
and
become
more
delicious
barleywine
isnt
a
style
i
fucks
with
much
but
this
brew
has
set
me
straight
it
fills
up
my
senses
like
a
walk
in
the
forest
its
warming
and
fervently
delectable
it
has
breathed
life
into
the
style
for
me
like
i
said
at
the
intro
imo
too
young
to
be
drinking
but
i
drank
it
anyway
i
love
me
some
bf
after
about
a
year
to
18
months
but
hey
cheap
buzz
the
review
is
based
on
a
fresh
2014
bottle
i
like
the
big
hops
so
i
usually
cant
hang
on
to
these
for
very
long
the
bigfoot
poured
a
deep
ruby
red
with
a
significant
head
a
good
retention
this
was
a
great
looking
beer
the
aroma
was
very
sweet
and
hoppy
with
citrus
hops
dominating
into
a
sweet
and
slightly
boozy
tones
the
taste
was
huge
with
more
bitter
resinous
hops
on
a
bed
of
bittersweet
malt
that
finishes
with
more
pine
hop
notes
the
bitter
pine
stays
on
your
palate
and
lingers
between
sips
of
this
mammoth
brew
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
finish
that
is
hidden
well
underneath
all
the
bitter
hops
and
malt
but
definitely
not
dominant
fresh
the
bigfoot
is
dangerously
drinkable
and
a
thickchewy
hoppy
brew
this
is
truly
great
stuff
i
gotta
visit
this
old
friend
more
often
o
still
cant
believe
how
good
this
is
for
the
price
sierra
nevada
knows
their
stuff
overall
i
think
it
needs
a
little
more
aging
its
like
its
in
transition
to
something
spectacular
o
very
impressed
with
this
2013
bigfoot
to
be
honest
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
fresh
these
american
barley
wines
seem
like
nothing
but
slightly
maltier
iipas
this
beer
with
a
year
has
really
developed
it
into
something
special
great
job
sn
i
hate
to
get
too
technical
and
give
something
a
4
5
for
appearance
or
mouthfeel
when
given
the
style
it
couldnt
be
any
different
or
better
so
this
ones
getting
5s
across
the
board
brilliant
brew
o
i
think
this
looks
smells
and
taste
much
like
a
double
ipa
but
with
a
greater
warming
effect
theres
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
but
without
the
joyous
aroma
or
flavor
i
expect
from
them
will
let
age
and
come
back
to
it
o
i
really
need
to
start
aging
some
of
this
i
really
want
to
try
one
with
a
couple
years
age
o
o
very
solid
barleywine
the
flavors
developed
nicely
as
it
warmed
looking
forward
to
aging
a
couple
for
a
bit
to
see
how
it
evolves
overall
its
just
got
a
flavor
profile
i
dont
really
like
that
much
i
think
its
well
done
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
maybe
it
would
be
better
aged
so
the
hops
arent
as
strong
but
to
be
honest
theres
not
that
much
else
i
can
taste
in
the
beer
that
i
would
look
forward
to
however
if
its
a
cold
wintry
night
and
you
want
something
warming
but
also
want
an
ipa
then
this
would
probably
be
your
beer
o
this
is
a
great
beer
i
will
purchase
at
least
a
4
pack
every
year
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
this
one
after
23
years
in
the
cellar
poured
straight
down
into
a
large
style
tulip
it
produced
a
massive
thick
fluffy
light
beigeoffwhite
three
finger
head
with
considerable
staying
power
after
a
couple
of
minutes
in
the
glass
it
was
still
well
over
a
finger
and
considerable
lacing
color
is
a
hazy
opaque
tawny
brown
with
hints
of
amber
nose
is
well
balanced
with
crisp
piney
and
slightly
grapefruit
hops
underlying
a
big
malty
nose
presenting
dark
caramel
toffee
molasses
a
tinge
of
vanilla
and
well
just
plain
old
malted
sweetness
for
a
9
6
abv
there
is
no
sign
on
the
nose
of
the
higher
alcohol
content
sip
is
bittersweet
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
leading
with
lightly
floral
piney
hop
notes
midpalate
sees
the
full
expression
of
this
powerful
and
complex
brew
with
an
explosion
of
multilayered
sweet
flavors
from
the
malt
including
caramel
stewed
fruits
dried
turkish
apricot
sweet
dark
bread
and
fruitcake
the
hop
component
has
a
fresh
and
extremely
wellbalanced
quality
and
presents
a
generalized
sense
of
light
citrus
and
pine
bitterness
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
swallow
sees
an
aggressive
hop
expression
overtake
some
pronounced
malty
caramel
notes
first
in
terms
of
light
crisp
pine
notes
and
then
an
aggressive
burst
of
tannic
slightly
rubbery
bitterness
finish
is
somewhat
thin
given
the
strength
and
depth
of
flavor
on
the
sip
and
consists
most
strongly
of
drying
tannins
with
again
notes
of
bitter
grapefruit
and
pine
despite
a
head
suggesting
massive
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
was
velvety
smooth
and
slick
while
the
alcohol
never
really
showed
up
i
meant
to
ab
this
with
last
years
bigfoot
but
before
i
could
do
it
someone
at
our
holiday
party
back
in
december
accidentally
drank
the
2012
bigfoot
id
been
saving
all
year
grrr
at
any
rate
based
on
my
review
of
last
years
bigfoot
this
one
seems
a
bit
less
hop
forward
and
more
malty
with
some
greater
depth
in
the
malt
profile
i
think
thats
an
improvement
and
a
better
reflection
of
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
american
barleywines
id
like
to
see
more
happen
in
the
finish
but
allinall
this
was
a
terrific
brew
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
for
the
taste
feel
and
overall
i
have
one
slight
issue
in
the
mix
of
sweetness
dark
fruits
and
tartness
combined
with
the
hops
bitterness
is
just
slightly
offputting
admittedly
this
beer
does
a
better
than
others
combine
that
with
the
nice
taste
of
dark
fruit
cherries
a
little
molasses
up
front
and
all
that
leads
to
my
ratings
overall
quality
flavors
and
aromas
all
the
way
around
definitely
rich
and
worth
sipping
for
a
while
2014
edition
pours
a
semiclear
dark
amber
color
with
a
fizzy
beige
head
the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
lingering
hints
of
bitter
hops
the
taste
is
bold
with
raw
barley
flavors
and
finishes
with
a
strong
hop
after
taste
well
made
and
very
flavorful
overall
great
american
barleywine
a
style
im
getting
to
know
better
grabbed
another
of
these
to
age
of
awhile
but
not
sure
that
it
needs
it
it
has
plenty
of
character
lots
of
nuance
and
different
notes
that
continue
to
pop
up
i
drank
one
of
these
in
early
august
and
it
was
much
more
bitter
with
a
more
noticeable
alcohol
taste
over
six
months
later
and
a
beer
aged
at
least
14
months
the
hop
bite
is
still
big
but
at
times
subdued
and
i
can
feel
the
alcohol
but
cant
taste
it
wouldnt
mind
aging
this
another
612
months
just
out
of
curiosity
othis
is
a
big
brash
beer
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
on
a
cold
winter
evening
im
not
sure
how
the
bitterness
and
alcohol
heat
work
so
well
together
but
they
do
barleywine
isnt
a
style
a
drink
often
but
im
glad
that
i
have
two
more
bottles
in
my
fourpack
to
age
and
watch
how
they
develop
i
like
this
even
better
than
torpedo
and
will
be
bummed
when
its
gone
its
a
great
offering
and
at
7
99
a
bargain
i
should
probably
pick
up
more
and
store
it
in
the
cellar
for
a
year
overall
really
good
beer
a
little
heavy
being
unaged
with
a
lot
of
sweetness
but
also
has
a
nice
bitter
finish
i
do
enjoy
this
with
about
a
year
of
aging
on
it
the
heavy
sweetness
drops
over
time
but
the
piney
hops
do
remain
with
age
i
wish
this
was
year
round
i
love
it
i
think
its
even
better
than
last
years
drinking
the
2014
thankfully
out
of
sheer
willpower
i
saved
some
of
the
2013
so
ill
try
in
comparison
the
smell
and
taste
are
both
big
and
the
look
is
beautiful
and
inviting
the
taste
is
piney
and
bitter
with
a
malt
all
around
its
rather
complex
to
be
able
to
define
particulars
but
the
total
experience
is
excellent
i
will
get
this
every
year
the
smell
and
feel
of
this
beer
are
my
favorite
parts
of
it
it
has
a
semisweet
smell
and
flavor
and
fills
your
mouth
even
if
youre
just
sipping
the
taste
comes
in
strong
at
first
and
then
you
begin
to
taste
the
little
touches
of
wheat
and
the
malt
they
use
one
of
the
few
criticisms
i
have
about
the
beer
is
that
the
end
has
a
bit
of
a
sour
feel
and
the
aftertaste
lasts
a
bit
too
long
if
youre
a
fan
of
big
barley
wine
style
beer
then
let
me
know
i
need
two
new
friends
now
overall
a
brash
hoppy
strong
ale
are
american
barleywines
the
true
american
strong
ales
its
all
herbal
resiny
hops
here
with
a
rich
malt
backbone
to
back
it
all
up
despite
being
about
two
years
old
at
this
point
its
still
way
hoppy
a
perfect
beer
to
try
each
year
and
see
how
it
progresses
o
i
expected
a
lot
and
got
it
with
this
one
the
only
knock
is
that
as
the
beer
warmed
the
9
6
abv
became
evident
of
course
if
you
are
going
to
drink
beers
like
this
you
have
to
be
ready
for
that
this
is
a
great
brew
worthy
of
a
try
another
great
offering
from
s
n
give
em
a
year
and
i
bet
not
the
most
complex
or
flavorful
barleywine
style
beer
ive
had
id
almost
say
that
it
can
be
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
2014
i
think
this
is
a
fantastic
barley
wine
its
a
strong
beer
and
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
to
attack
a
beer
like
this
but
after
running
lifting
and
cutting
the
grass
after
a
long
day
i
though
a
bigfoot
would
be
a
great
way
to
finish
the
evening
off
copper
colored
ale
with
a
small
white
head
smells
sweet
like
honey
has
a
sweet
flavor
along
with
a
whole
lot
of
bitterness
i
wonder
what
aging
would
do
to
this
one
very
enjoyable
plus
it
has
the
best
bottle
cap
art
at
the
bottom
end
of
the
bottle
cap
i
have
seen
aroma
has
traces
of
citruspine
hops
light
fruits
and
caramel
malts
at
first
the
taste
is
a
balance
of
citruspine
hop
and
caramel
malt
with
a
tiny
bit
of
alcohol
as
this
warms
up
the
caramel
malt
takes
over
the
hops
subsides
to
a
bright
dark
fruit
taste
which
balances
very
well
with
the
strong
malt
presence
overall
this
beer
is
very
good
with
a
year
on
it
and
great
with
2
years
on
when
fresh
this
is
good
but
the
hops
especially
pine
overshadow
the
malt
and
fruit
flavors
so
meeting
in
the
middle
this
gets
a
very
good
score
but
it
really
depends
on
what
one
prefers
in
a
barleywine
and
i
prefer
less
of
a
hop
presence
o
all
of
the
makings
of
a
good
quaff
are
there
but
the
verdant
flavors
need
a
few
years
to
work
out
their
differences
everything
felt
and
tasted
too
spread
out
and
disconnected
not
fully
integrated
o
a
really
great
beer
with
a
good
balance
between
malts
and
hops
itll
be
interesting
to
see
how
other
bottles
from
this
same
vintage
evolve
totally
recommendable
o
4
5
overall
another
terrific
offering
from
sierra
nevada
lower
on
my
list
of
sn
brews
but
hanging
with
very
good
company
overall
huge
flavor
huge
beer
the
hop
bite
on
the
finish
is
a
little
too
assertive
for
my
tastes
but
the
malt
balance
is
impeccable
i
worried
it
was
going
to
be
too
sweet
but
its
just
right
and
not
cloying
at
all
maybe
the
most
amazing
thing
of
all
the
big
abv
is
nowhere
to
be
found
a
big
impressive
brew
this
is
a
bold
beer
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
ill
be
aging
the
rest
for
awhile
to
see
how
it
progresses
full
body
and
slightly
syrupy
but
lightened
up
a
little
by
some
decent
soft
carbonation
nice
to
revisit
this
one
after
so
long
othis
beer
had
a
hard
hop
smell
that
did
not
disappoint
you
in
the
taste
or
the
the
finish
o
this
is
a
bigflavored
wellmade
barleywine
beerandwhiskeyhq
com
good
offering
from
sn
once
again
the
age
really
let
the
malty
sweetness
shine
and
overcome
the
hops
i
like
it
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
to
like
this
beer
first
off
as
barleywines
go
this
is
a
great
deal
four
for
ten
bucks
second
its
a
tasty
beer
plenty
of
character
perhaps
not
as
complex
as
others
ive
tasted
but
i
am
drinking
it
fresh
ill
age
a
few
and
perhaps
revisit
this
review
o
not
your
typical
barley
wine
this
is
very
hoppy
and
spicy
some
purists
would
scoff
at
this
because
these
elements
mask
the
malty
sweetness
you
might
expect
but
it
makes
it
different
and
interesting
might
benefit
from
cellaring
for
some
time
overall
delicious
excellent
a
standard
etc
very
much
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
ages
ooverall
this
beer
is
great
first
time
having
a
barleywine
going
to
store
the
rest
for
years
to
come
overall
this
is
my
first
time
trying
bigfoot
definitely
contains
a
lot
more
hops
than
i
anticipated
not
that
its
a
bad
thing
though
the
flavor
is
superb
by
my
preference
the
only
problem
i
had
was
with
the
balance
the
malts
did
not
linger
around
long
enough
for
me
to
taste
their
full
essence
perhaps
that
is
something
that
will
fix
itself
in
the
cellar
overall
this
is
one
heck
of
a
mean
brew
the
pine
hop
bitter
mixed
with
definite
alcohol
creates
almost
a
solventlike
taste
but
you
acclimate
to
it
as
you
drink
it
watch
out
for
hangovers
with
this
one
overall
a
great
american
bw
standard
o
overall
enjoyed
this
beer
by
sierra
nevada
very
interested
in
cellaring
a
few
to
see
how
time
changes
them
overall
this
is
a
great
well
balanced
brew
i
was
never
a
big
fan
of
the
barleywine
style
they
are
usually
to
sweet
and
boozy
but
this
is
one
barleywine
i
will
drink
again
o
overall
great
beer
the
malty
maple
nose
is
balanced
in
a
very
unique
way
with
the
floral
hops
the
taste
is
complex
and
layered
definitely
going
to
invest
in
this
years
for
some
ageing
i
told
myself
id
never
drink
another
sierra
nevada
beer
but
saw
this
and
thought
ok
theyre
doing
a
barley
wine
maybe
this
one
will
be
different
nope
just
more
hops
than
ever
before
i
mean
really
sierra
nevada
takes
the
ipa
model
and
makes
every
damn
thing
they
brew
taste
like
just
another
version
of
an
ipa
did
i
happen
to
mention
that
i
detest
ipas
cramming
a
brew
full
of
hops
does
not
equal
a
great
brew
it
just
shows
a
profound
lack
of
imagination
but
for
all
you
hopheads
out
there
youll
love
this
stuff
personally
ill
pass
and
thank
you
very
little
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
the
bitterness
for
me
was
overwhelming
and
there
wasnt
really
anything
else
to
the
flavor
for
me
the
smell
was
deceiving
it
smells
like
heavenly
fruit
but
has
about
the
opposite
taste
the
color
and
lacing
are
all
accurate
as
to
what
the
other
reviewers
said
overall
i
think
its
my
favorite
sn
beer
and
i
always
look
forward
to
trying
it
i
have
had
this
aged
for
3
years
and
it
somehow
still
remains
hoppy
but
at
the
same
time
delivers
a
nice
blended
aged
flavor
profile
that
makes
it
slightly
better
2014
update
tastes
even
better
i
did
a
sidebyside
with
old
foghorn
the
first
american
barleywine
had
similar
notes
but
bigfoot
crushes
it
with
balance
it
is
so
wellbalanced
and
doesnt
invade
your
tastebuds
in
anyway
this
years
edition
seemed
less
bitter
which
is
exactly
what
i
wished
this
beer
would
be
sierra
nevada
has
improved
on
a
worldclass
classic
bravo
2013
bottle
pours
out
a
real
nice
dark
redmore
maroon
in
color
with
a
nice
white
onefinger
head
that
lays
down
some
nice
lacing
smell
is
pretty
malty
really
sweet
as
one
would
assume
from
the
style
smells
really
nice
but
i
could
use
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
but
nothing
to
take
away
from
this
beer
taste
is
very
malt
forward
with
less
sweetness
in
the
mouth
i
can
definitely
taste
some
hops
at
the
end
that
really
make
this
beer
taste
incredible
as
the
piny
hops
seem
to
really
balance
out
the
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
thick
as
one
would
expect
overall
i
really
need
to
get
some
more
of
this
stuff
and
age
it
its
a
great
beer
hard
to
not
drink
it
2010
bottle
opened
late
2013
redbrown
with
thin
head
sweet
smell
pineapple
orange
rose
taste
is
sweet
malt
bitter
hops
slightly
sour
the
heat
from
the
alcohol
was
a
little
much
for
me
maybe
this
one
needed
to
sit
a
few
more
years
i
want
to
do
a
vertical
for
some
comparison
rating
9
3
then
theres
the
alcohol
bigfoot
does
a
far
better
job
of
masking
the
taste
of
alcohol
than
other
brews
such
as
hoptimum
with
similar
abvs
i
dont
know
how
they
did
it
but
ive
had
beers
with
substantially
lower
levels
of
alcohol
that
were
far
more
boozy
tasting
than
bigfoot
well
i
am
not
gonna
fault
the
beer
for
the
excessive
bitterness
it
is
just
not
as
good
as
i
know
it
could
be
if
you
got
any
2011s
around
i
would
let
them
sit
for
a
couple
more
years
with
that
said
i
think
i
need
to
start
drinking
my
2012s
after
collecting
this
beer
for
the
past
five
years
hoping
to
see
just
how
good
it
would
get
with
time
i
just
dont
think
it
is
as
good
as
memory
may
serve
for
most
of
us
there
are
many
better
barleywines
being
made
than
this
one
the
main
issue
i
have
is
that
in
creating
an
american
version
of
this
style
they
made
the
bitterness
so
intense
that
after
two
years
of
cellaring
it
is
still
too
bitter
and
too
unbalanced
for
my
palette
70
ibus
with
something
other
than
chinook
or
centennial
would
help
to
make
the
malt
more
prominent
along
with
less
sulfate
in
the
water
otherwise
it
is
just
overly
simple
for
the
style
it
would
be
better
dryhopped
to
make
a
triple
ipa
like
founders
devil
dancer
that
should
be
the
target
for
bigfoot
at
least
that
beer
improves
with
age
and
is
good
fresh
the
1990s
are
gone
and
we
should
all
expect
more
from
a
great
american
brewery
that
helped
to
buck
the
status
quo
straight
up
no
barrel
aging
all
guns
blazing
hellion
of
a
bw
overall
this
might
be
my
favorite
offering
from
sierra
nevada
it
is
well
balanced
and
has
nuisance
that
go
beyond
being
a
hop
bomb
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
bitter
beers
however
this
one
is
nicely
balanced
and
i
recommend
trying
it
if
you
can
find
it
note
although
i
stand
by
my
review
scores
and
consider
this
undrinkable
i
should
have
realized
it
actually
does
fit
within
the
style
of
being
very
hoppy
as
it
is
an
american
styled
barleywine
american
styled
barleywines
have
a
more
aggressive
hop
profile
than
their
english
counterparts
and
i
failed
to
realize
that
at
the
time
update
11715
aged
a
few
bottles
and
had
one
tonight
caramel
malt
is
not
as
much
in
evidence
nor
is
the
piney
hop
bite
more
balanced
now
the
high
abv
still
evident
but
little
throat
burn
am
lowering
the
taste
score
from
4
5
to
4
25
this
is
good
stuff
boys
not
your
lankey
corpiarets
swill
no
this
is
a
barley
wine
with
smooth
taste
and
good
aroma
i
always
drink
from
the
bottle
so
cant
say
as
to
the
pour
but
im
sure
she
does
well
a
bit
sweet
and
chocolaty
good
for
breakfast
goes
well
with
toast
and
jam
as
for
the
drunkability
well
its
hard
to
drink
many
as
its
so
filling
you
drink
two
and
your
full
of
it
so
i
dont
buzz
of
this
stuff
its
for
the
connoisseur
but
a
good
drink
to
say
the
least
o
not
what
i
expected
out
of
barleywine
but
a
decidedly
tasty
experiment
nonetheless
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
and
would
recommend
it
this
beer
is
complex
and
full
of
malt
and
hops
overall
this
a
decidedly
unbalanced
brewa
thin
bitter
barleywine
that
looks
the
part
but
tastes
nothing
as
it
ought
to
in
addition
the
12
had
less
bitterness
but
still
a
strong
marijuana
green
pine
bitterness
the
10
stood
out
as
the
bitterness
mellowed
out
and
the
sweetness
and
caramel
starting
shining
more
definitely
age
this
for
a
while
o
a
nice
and
hearty
barleywine
thats
very
drinkable
and
goes
well
with
the
cold
winter
months
honestly
this
is
the
best
beer
that
i
have
ever
tasted
it
has
all
the
characteristics
that
i
could
ever
want
in
a
beer
high
hop
high
alcohol
big
fruit
flavor
and
smooth
creamy
mouth
feel
this
is
definitely
not
the
last
barley
wine
i
will
drink
i
will
buy
5
bottles
and
age
them
too
bad
this
beer
is
hard
to
find
overall
solid
solid
brew
the
more
sierra
i
drink
the
more
i
grow
to
respect
them
as
a
brewery
as
i
said
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
if
not
a
bit
hoppier
than
i
expected
if
you
love
sierras
other
brews
youll
love
this
one
drinkability
initially
i
was
wondering
if
i
would
be
able
to
get
through
this
thing
it
was
so
hop
forward
and
bitter
but
in
the
end
i
couldnt
stop
sipping
it
it
was
so
addictive
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
could
definitely
have
had
another
one
and
was
seriously
considering
opening
the
other
bottles
i
had
bought
to
cellar
my
aim
is
to
open
the
next
one
in
a
few
years
or
so
to
see
how
it
has
aged
as
it
seems
4
years
is
the
collective
recommendation
overall
a
really
nice
combination
of
malt
and
hops
makes
this
very
drinkable
alcohol
is
well
hidden
overall
this
is
a
brighter
tasting
barleywine
than
im
used
to
but
i
rather
liked
it
could
have
been
a
bit
more
balanced
a
smidge
less
hops
a
dash
more
fruit
and
was
lacking
in
alcohol
characteristics
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
o
i
have
had
only
a
couple
of
barleywines
this
has
held
its
bitterness
very
well
after
being
aged
a
year
ill
keep
exploring
the
style
but
i
think
i
will
like
these
best
after
some
age
overall
first
of
this
particular
style
but
man
this
was
a
good
beer
im
very
impressed
with
it
and
will
hold
it
as
the
standard
to
measure
others
in
this
particular
style
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
but
this
is
a
well
balanced
thickhoney
like
brew
that
is
great
i
usually
like
what
sierra
nevada
produces
but
i
just
picked
this
up
to
fill
up
the
sixth
slot
in
a
mixsix
i
wish
it
were
20
degrees
cooler
and
i
had
a
full
six
great
beer
o
overall
this
was
outstanding
i
was
glad
i
was
able
to
have
a
two
year
vintage
off
tap
ive
had
a
few
barleywines
before
and
this
one
takes
the
cake
o
i
havent
had
many
barleywines
so
i
am
not
that
knowledgeable
concerning
the
style
but
i
did
like
the
bitter
finish
and
for
a
high
gravity
it
was
pretty
drinkable
i
might
could
learn
to
like
this
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
dark
copper
the
color
of
an
old
penny
with
a
thick
creamy
head
some
fruity
sweet
esters
on
the
nose
with
maybe
a
hint
of
booze
nice
taste
like
brandy
but
without
the
booziness
a
little
winey
sweetness
a
little
hop
bite
that
finishes
a
bit
bitter
some
carbonation
but
light
overall
more
alelike
than
winelike
at
9
5
abv
i
am
definitely
feeling
it
yet
it
doesnt
taste
especially
boozy
still
a
sipper
but
enjoyable
great
barley
wine
option
for
hopheads
and
for
who
doesnt
like
overly
sweet
ones
it
grows
overtime
so
that
i
had
to
keeping
changing
the
grade
upward
i
have
to
try
next
one
after
keeping
it
for
at
least
4
5
years
and
see
how
its
aroma
and
caramel
malt
bold
already
makes
room
well
know
beer
for
aging
well
recommended
but
it
is
a
beer
for
the
experienced
ones
update
had
a
2001
version
at
ebf
2014
rating
4
505
overall
this
is
great
ive
never
had
it
fresh
or
aged
per
se
but
with
a
little
over
a
year
on
it
its
really
enjoyable
well
balanced
flavorful
interesting
and
with
a
solid
feel
highly
recommended
i
will
begin
by
saying
this
is
my
first
barley
wine
style
ale
im
a
huge
fan
of
sierra
nevada
so
when
i
saw
this
in
the
cooler
at
the
store
i
was
all
over
it
im
gonna
make
this
brief
because
i
want
to
get
to
drinking
my
next
one
it
is
a
beautiful
dark
copper
color
it
start
with
heavy
yeasty
taste
like
a
good
double
bock
but
some
how
finishes
with
a
nice
slam
of
clean
hoppy
goodness
i
fricken
loves
this
beer
going
to
drink
3
later
o
the
body
states
this
is
a
beast
of
a
beer
i
definitely
agree
reminiscent
of
a
very
hoppy
quadruple
this
metallic
aftertaste
was
a
bit
odd
but
it
kind
of
grew
on
me
despite
the
fact
that
im
not
sure
if
it
was
supposed
to
be
there
or
not
either
way
definitely
a
nice
beer
o
good
definitely
a
sipper
given
the
abv
another
great
one
from
sierra
nevada
to
go
along
with
narwahl
and
hoptimum
honestly
what
an
american
bw
should
be
malty
and
hoppy
but
with
both
elements
melding
together
nicely
surprisingly
smooth
given
the
strength
even
though
id
had
this
beer
before
i
dont
remember
liking
it
quite
this
much
if
i
had
any
room
in
the
cellar
for
nonlambic
beer
this
would
certainly
be
it
no
other
brew
ive
come
across
evolves
in
such
an
interesting
manner
and
holds
up
so
well
after
so
many
years
really
a
solid
beer
from
sierra
nevada
overall
this
beer
is
a
great
beer
its
strong
but
the
flavors
are
well
worth
it
would
be
a
welcomed
drink
around
my
house
in
the
winter
months
to
warm
up
with
overall
this
wasnt
as
big
a
malt
bomb
as
other
barley
wines
some
are
cloyingly
sweet
yet
this
starts
out
sweet
and
finishes
bitter
this
beer
could
almost
compare
to
a
double
ipa
curious
if
the
bitterness
would
stick
around
for
another
year
overall
this
is
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
it
has
the
sweet
malty
syrupy
and
spicy
characteristics
of
a
barley
wine
but
its
not
heavy
or
overwhelming
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
i
really
enjoyed
complex
flavors
and
scents
i
especially
liked
the
hops
and
dry
finish
bravo
sierra
nevada
thick
on
the
palate
finishes
extra
extra
dry
excellent
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
creaminess
that
i
love
it
does
not
coat
the
mouth
and
has
a
dry
finish
remarks
good
beer
overall
but
would
personally
prefer
more
of
an
english
flavor
profile
fun
versatile
american
barleywine
really
enjoyable
obviously
cellarable
and
a
bargain
for
the
price
out
here
cant
wait
to
gradually
work
through
the
others
in
winter
next
year
there
isnt
much
else
to
say
bigfoots
an
exceptional
barley
wine
and
a
fine
example
of
a
beer
that
delivers
a
brilliant
balance
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
i
love
it
when
beers
do
that
hehe
overall
great
barleywine
12oz

light
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
fruity
yeasty
with
a
kind
of
brandy
like

fill
the
senses
taste
is
of
caramel
malt
yeast
with
a
brandy
like
fruity
flavor
palate
is
a
full
body
smooth
and
nicely
balanced
with
a
sweet
slight
bitterness
and
sticky
mouth
feel
finishes
with
a
nice
caramel
malt
yeast
and
fruity
with
slight
bitter
notes
undoubtedly
tamed
by
the
aging
aroma
and
flavor
intensify
as
it
warms
up
overall
a
very
good
smooth
drinking
flavorful
and
nicely
balanced
barley
wine
very
nice
the
flavor
brings
some
of
that
sweet
malty
caramel
bitter
hops
golden
raisins
and
dark
fruit
the
lasting
taste
is
cool
from
the
booze
and
hops
slightly
syrupy
with
a
faint
touch
of
apple
cobbler
it
has
a
deep
amber
body
small
offwhite
head
with
good
lacing
fleeting
pine
resin
and
citrus
aromas
that
really
didnt
last
very
long
very
hoppy
flavor
which
my
wife
liked
but
more
like
an
ipa
than
barley
wine
somewhat
thin
and
slippery
feel
it
has
a
lingering
citrus
back
end
with
the
everpresent
hops
and
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
for
my
taste
08
vintage
deep
red
color
smells
luscious
and
fruity
very
viscous
and
a
decent
head
for
having
some
age
on
it
bitter
up
front
but
warms
up
to
a
malty
and
fruity
flavor
crisp
clean
finish
not
my
favorite
barley
wine
sadly
o
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
had
always
a
solid
offering
from
sierra
nevada
2013
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
overall
not
a
bad
barleywine
all
told
but
really
not
worth
the
price
especially
when
compared
to
cheaper
yet
betterrounded
barleywines
from
brewers
like
moylans
or
green
flash
recommended

barleywine
as
a
style
is
pretty
hit
or
miss
for
me
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
theres
no
medicinal
backbone
that
many
have
yet
this
is
definitely
all
barleywine
i
really
appreciate
the
crazy
levels
of
everything
here
maybe
just
a
little
less
bitterness
wouldve
taken
this
one
further
for
me
pours
a
mahogany
red
with
2
fingers
of
tight
creamy
foam
that
fell
off
when
it
was
good
and
ready
amazing
clarity
left
some
yeast
floating
on
top
and
some
sticky
sticky
lace
just
beautiful
nose
is
big
sweet
malt
delicious
and
fat
with
caramel
toffee
and
grain
hops
round
it
out
with
dark
fruits
cherry
and
floral
touch
of
spice
way
way
in
back
malt
opens
up
fat
and
bold
as
it
warms
its
sweetness
deepens
but
never
goes
over
the
top
hops
character
is
always
forthcoming
enlivening
and
bursting
with
resin
and
bitter
alcohol
stays
well
hidden
until
the
end
and
contributes
to
the
dryness
in
the
finish
balance
is
perfect
between
the
big
sweet
grain
and
the
oily
bitter
this
is
a
strapping
and
downright
huge
beer
that
was
a
pleasure
from
first
sip
to
last
just
a
really
good
barleywine
not
too
strong
and
not
too
weak
just
right
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
overallcomments
a
great
beer
that
is
very
intense
in
the
nose
and
on
the
palette
sticks
with
a
hop
dominate
backbone
as
is
true
with
most
sn
brews
a
must
try
classifed
as
an
american
barleywine

overall
coming
into
this
i
was
a
little
excited
to
enjoy
this
since
ive
heard
good
things
and
now
im
glad
i
did
who
knew
a
little
trip
to
a
smalltime
gas
station
would
be
worth
it
starting
out
this
was
something
special
with
the
superb
lacing
and
delicious
aroma
then
the
tasting
took
it
to
a
whole
other
level
with
awesome
caramel
flavors
and
a
slight
strike
of
alcohol
but
overall
was
wellbalanced
and
good
i
would
totally
enjoy
again
especially
on
tap
if
i
can
locate
it
i
would
totally
recommend
to
a
friend
cheers
o
great
barley
wine
alcohol
present
but
blends
well
with
flavors
lots
of
flavor
strong
hops
presence
but
not
overwhelming
due
to
the
matching
malt
backbone
overall
i
just
wasnt
that
crazy
about
this
beer
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
candidate
for
aging
to
mellow
out
some
of
the
hop
character
im
not
much
of
a
hop
head
so
the
aggressive
hop
nature
wasnt
really
up
alley
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
i
certainly
could
have
spent
my
money
elsewhere
oh
well
you
win
some
you
lose
some
and
i
lost
this
one
big
time
edit
for
2013
once
again
they
nailed
it
the
original
review
is
more
than
a
year
old
but
now
ive
had
5
different
years
of
vintages
both
aged
and
for
the
more
recent
years
fresh
every
time
its
just
fantastic
gold
standard
of
barleywines
monstrous
hops
and
tons
of
delicious
malts
one
of
my
favorite
beers
anytime
from
any
brewery
o
great
beer
overall
this
strikes
a
great
balance
of
the
hops
i
love
and
barley
wine
i
also
love
sierra
nevada
does
a
great
job
this
did
well
with
6
months
on
it
and
i
will
hang
on
to
a
couple
more
to
try
at
12
months
and
beyond
o
i
would
never
say
that
barleywines
are
my
desired
style
of
beer
that
being
said
i
do
love
hoppy
beers
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
hoppiness
of
fresh
bigfoot
i
will
likely
pick
up
another
single
if
i
can
find
one
to
age
for
a
while
to
see
if
i
enjoy
the
brew
that
way
but
i
was
happy
with
this
now
i
understand
the
hype
to
the
point
i
like
this
ale
it
is
a
sipper
im
still
new
at
barleywines
this
is
a
big
bold
hoppy
version
of
one
which
im
sure
would
mellow
out
with
age
not
really
my
thing
but
i
can
certainly
enjoy
this
as
i
drink
it
lots
to
take
note
of
during
consumption
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
of
these
down
if
offered
to
me
again
o
this
beer
has
held
up
very
well
for
being
11
years
old
i
will
have
to
try
it
fresh
to
compare
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
bottom
line
get
some
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
or
hoppy
beers
in
general
i
felt
the
taste
was
a
bit
rough
and
maybe
would
mellow
with
some
age
however
i
am
trying
to
remain
objective
in
this
assessment
i
did
serve
this
with
some
slices
of
cheddar
cheese
which
was
an
excellent
touch
with
the
hop
bitterness
well
made
not
my
favorite
but
i
appreciate
the
complexity
o
very
drinkable
huge
malts
and
hops
would
drink
again
overall
this
is
my
first
taste
of
this
style
and
ultimately
its
a
big
beer
tons
of
sweet
roasted
malts
and
tons
of
bitter
hops
i
wouldnt
purchase
this
again
just
because
its
not
my
style
but
for
those
who
are
looking
for
this
you
may
find
alot
to
like
in
this
beer
330
calories
worth
haha
enjoy
overall
man
with
this
amount
of
hops
i
would
imagine
this
would
be
a
great
candidate
for
aging
would
be
just
awesome
to
do
a
ladder
for
a
bunch
of
them
and
see
how
they
age
from
one
year
to
the
next
o
i
was
very
impressed
with
how
this
bottle
aged
when
smelling
the
aroma
the
booziness
made
me
a
little
nervous
since
big
boozy
beers
arent
my
thing
but
once
i
took
a
sip
i
was
impressed
with
the
different
flavors
that
came
to
the
front
more
so
than
a
bottle
of
a
fresh
bigfoot
the
smoothness
really
made
it
enjoyable
to
drink
and
it
definitely
mellowed
out
over
time
very
well
crafted
barleywine
perfect
for
aging
o
still
getting
accustomed
to
the
barleywine
style
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
i
have
tried
will
be
setting
aside
a
few
of
these
for
some
years
at
least
thats
the
plan
well
see
how
that
goes
to
see
how
they
pan
out
a
pretty
good
beer
i
wanted
to
like
it
more
but
the
bitterness
is
a
little
to
dominating
one
of
the
best
beers
to
age
and
im
glad
i
found
a
cheap
bottle
of
it
to
try
overall
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
this
beer
in
a
few
years
and
i
can
definitely
see
why
it
is
often
heralded
as
an
american
craft
beer
classic
it
is
definitely
hard
to
believe
that
this
beer
has
been
brewed
for
over
30
years
its
bitterness
can
definitely
stand
up
to
a
lot
of
imperial
ipas
that
are
brewed
today
it
is
somewhat
stripped
down
in
its
complexity
as
this
bottle
very
young
but
i
can
definitely
tell
that
this
beer
will
just
become
deeper
and
deeper
with
a
couple
of
years
of
age
on
it
overall
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
liked
the
idea
of
the
toasted
malts
in
the
barleywine
but
the
hop
choice
was
off
for
me
i
will
hang
on
to
some
and
see
how
it
ages
o
a
little
harsh
from
it
being
so
green
but
an
otherwise
outstanding
brew
cant
wait
to
try
an
aged
version
o
i
dont
know
if
i
will
ever
quite
understand
the
american
barleywine
style
why
add
hops
to
something
that
is
supposed
to
be
sweet
and
syrupy
ohh
well
this
beer
is
alright
but
its
super
hot
right
now
and
would
benefit
greatly
from
a
few
years
of
cellaring
2013
bottle
it
poured
a
really
nicelooking
garnet
which
opened
up
in
the
chimay
goblet
i
chose
didnt
have
a
lot
of
carbonation
at
first
rather
lots
of
little
bubbles
that
kept
coming
for
a
while
smelled
hoppy
but
in
a
deep
imperial
kind
of
way
floral
not
fruity
interesting
taste
taking
a
gulp
it
has
a
bit
of
a
notwellhidden
sweetness
to
it
but
the
hops
are
there
to
let
you
know
whos
boss
i
enjoyed
the
initial
taste
but
thought
that
the
hops
lingered
far
too
long
afterward
and
left
a
sticky
unpleasant
coating
behind
overall
i
was
expecting
some
more
malt
presence
and
was
disappointed
by
how
quickly
the
big
hops
came
in
and
dominated
the
slightly
sweet
flavoring
it
made
me
long
for
the
quick
burst
of
raisindate
sweetness
that
remained
just
out
of
reach
o
excellent
had
this
again
in
2013
amazing
balance
of
big
malt
and
robust
hops
o
a
fine
abw
that
is
extremely
drinkable
and
delicious
was
looking
for
a
bit
more
from
this
though
o
its
a
great
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
assertive
hop
profile
great
balance
but
considering
the
high
alcohol
presence
its
meant
to
be
a
sipper
i
havent
tried
an
aged
sample
but
i
can
tell
this
would
be
even
more
delicious
with
some
age
overall
i
love
this
beer
sierra
nevada
has
never
let
me
down
most
definitely
my
favorite
beer
by
them
so
far
overall
enjoyable
barleywine
but
for
some
reason
i
dont
think
i
like
what
age
has
done
to
it
so
far
but
this
one
has
been
in
the
fridge
wheras
others
have
been
in
the
cellar
wonder
how
that
will
make
a
difference
might
have
to
do
a
small
vertical
when
i
can
get
some
2014
in
my
humble
opinion
this
is
more
of
a
double
ipa
than
a
barleywine
at
least
on
taste
alone
blame
the
simcoe
hops
blame
my
eastcoast
bias
for
some
reason
this
just
doesnt
add
up
a
good
beer
which
will
get
you
nice
and
toasty
i
just
have
a
hard
time
associating
this
as
a
barleywine
and
more
as
an
imperial
westcoast
ipa
this
is
based
off
taste
and
smell
not
how
it
is
brewed
i
devour
most
things
sierra
nevada
and
while
i
am
not
disapproving
i
extend
a
word
of
caution
treat
this
as
more
of
its
own
raw
ale
instead
of
a
barleywine
and
your
palate
will
be
appeased
poured
a
beautiful
clear
amberred
color
with
a
finger
width
khaki
colored
head
it
dissipated
leaving
some
lacing
along
the
side
smells
of
pineyresinous
and
fruity
hops
plus
carameltoffee
flavors
from
the
malts
the
taste
is
bitter
upfront
from
the
hops
and
then
followed
by
the
malts
with
hints
of
carameltoffee
flavors
medium
body
with
some
carbonation
on
the
tongue
bitter
and
sticky
on
the
finish
a
nice
hoppy
barley
wine
cant
wait
to
age
a
few
and
see
how
they
turn
out
overall
very
good
i
was
a
late
bloomer
to
sierra
nevada
but
ive
been
seeking
them
out
more
and
more
o
this
seems
like
what
120
should
be
what
is
up
with
the
beers
that
i
tried
tonight
the
wws
is
the
only
one
that
seems
to
have
been
labeled
right
bigfoot
and
120
should
switch
beer
types
i
really
wonder
what
this
would
be
like
with
some
age
on
it
when
the
hops
die
down
you
can
tell
that
there
is
another
beer
in
there
somewhere
i
love
this
ipa
but
it
seems
to
turn
into
a
bw
with
age
overall
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
this
is
my
second
time
trying
it
first
of
this
year
and
it
is
similar
to
what
i
remembered
from
before
this
may
just
not
be
my
style
i
realize
this
is
a
highly
acclaimed
and
well
loved
beer
her
on
ba
but
to
each
hisher
own
overall
not
one
of
their
best
offerings
but
still
better
than
most
commercial
offerings
o
this
is
my
first
barleywine
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
am
impressed
i
am
currently
cellaring
some
right
now
and
will
definitely
buy
next
year
so
i
can
add
to
my
collection
bigfoot
is
definitely
a
great
intro
to
barleywines
as
it
is
very
accessible
and
tastes
great
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
this
style
i
was
underwhelmed
at
first
sip
as
i
thought
it
tasted
too
much
like
a
typical
ipa
but
as
it
warmed
up
the
flavors
really
started
to
come
out
absolutely
exceptional
appearance
is
a
deep
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
and
a
thin
yellowishwhite
colored
head
with
decent
retention
the
nose
is
full
of
pacific
nw
hops
and
yeast
as
it
fades
into
a
peppery
finish
taste
is
where
everything
comes
together
it
has
a
bittersweet
body
as
the
hops
and
yeast
precede
and
compliment
a
malty
background
with
a
semipeppery
finish
smooth
with
just
the
right
mount
of
carbonation
this
beer
goes
down
nicely
overall
its
a
superb
brew
this
is
my
first
barleywine
styled
beer
ever
so
my
bar
is
set
very
very
high
clearly
needs
to
age
just
not
ready
to
drink
yet
in
a
year
maybe
even
23
i
can
imagine
this
being
a
lot
more
complex
and
powerful
saving
the
rest
o
maybe
this
is
better
after
aging
it
for
a
year
right
now
it
seems
underdeveloped
it
is
certainly
affecting
my
toxicity
level
but
i
dont
think
i
enjoy
it
all
that
much
certainly
not
to
its
reputation
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pretty
mahogany
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
fruits
and
alcohol
taste
is
boozy
some
dark
fruits
malts
a
touch
of
hops
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
beer
not
as
good
as
i
expected
o
bigfoot
for
sure
newcomers
beware
this
is
a
beer
you
should
enjoy
with
friends
as
theres
a
lot
to
explore
and
discuss
here
daunting
but
also
fun
great
beer
for
special
occasions
and
robust
meals
o
a
big
beer
hops
malt
alcohol
balance
slightly
warming
the
alcohol
does
not
hide
but
neither
is
this
beer
too
hot
a
winter
warmer
if
there
ever
was
one
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
give
me
some
heavier
floral
notes
and
this
beer
would
at
the
head
of
my
class
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
barleywine
style
ale
4
55
a
2013
bottle
beer
pours
rich
red
color
with
about
2
5
fingers
of
khaki
head
the
head
is
foamy
with
great
retention
eventually
dies
off
to
a
thin
blanket
beer
smells
mostly
of
hops
and
a
gentle
sweetness
a
big
juicy
westcoast
nose
the
flavor
is
very
big
spicy
and
hop
forward
i
notice
the
big
malt
presence
but
it
is
clearly
overshadowed
by
the
hops
at
this
point
a
bitter
flavor
lingers
mediumlow
carbonation
mediumheavy
mouth
feel
i
would
like
a
bit
more
creaminess
overall
a
great
beer
that
could
use
some
age
unsurprisingly
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
release
from
sierra
nevada
one
i
look
forward
to
having
every
year
very
easy
to
find
in
the
winter
months
and
sometimes
very
much
afterward
and
quite
affordable
at
9
99
per
4pack
in
this
area
definitely
would
recommend
checking
it
out
if
youve
never
tried
it
overall
i
can
tell
this
is
a
good
beer
although
admittedly
i
dont
tend
to
go
for
the
hoppy
brews
i
definitely
dont
regret
picking
up
a
six
pack
of
this
although
i
cant
say
ill
be
doing
that
again
with
much
frequency
but
purely
because
of
personal
preference
i
dont
really
have
any
negative
comments
about
this
beer
o
i
have
little
experience
with
the
style
but
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
sweeter
and
less
bitter
than
it
was
this
is
very
reminiscent
of
dipa
o
a
friend
recommended
i
try
this
as
im
not
a
fan
of
barleywines
while
most
that
ive
had
are
much
worse
than
this
this
definitely
didnt
make
me
a
fan
too
sweet
and
too
boozey
for
my
palate
but
i
liked
the
nice
hop
addition
bravo
o
the
playful
melody
of
hops
in
a
barleywine
is
something
interesting
although
i
would
prefer
them
subdued
with
some
aging
o
a
consistently
good
barley
wine
highly
hopped
and
notably
bitter
with
just
enough
sweetness
to
keep
it
interesting
i
have
the
2013
vintage
to
try
next
as
well
as
the
barrel
aged
version
2013
bottle
this
was
the
2013
bigfoot
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
16
oz
straight
sided
mug
overall
not
as
balanced
as
i
like
but
not
bad
either
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
before
hunting
down
a
barrel
aged
version
cant
say
im
interested
in
the
barrel
version
anymore
i
have
read
that
the
taste
is
all
whiskey
and
now
knowing
what
the
base
is
like
i
have
no
doubt
that
is
an
accurate
assessment
ill
probably
try
the
2014
batch
but
will
not
be
getting
anymore
of
the
2013
note
my
first
pour
was
clear
my
second
pour
contained
tons
of
yeast
sediment
the
yeast
was
fantastic
exemplifying
tons
of
nutty
banana
bubblegum
goodness
if
youre
sharing
a
bottle
i
suggest
saving
the
yeast
for
your
own
glass
its
that
good
the
biggest
plus
for
bigfoot
is
its
cellarability
storing
bigfoot
in
a
cool
dry
place
will
allow
it
to
continue
brewing
for
years
while
killing
off
some
of
the
strong
alcoholic
taste
properties
it
is
a
great
beer
to
do
verticals
with
grab
a
few
bottles
and
store
them
in
their
natural
habitat
undisturbed
a
sighting
months
and
even
years
down
the
line
should
yield
amazing
results
o
pretty
disappointed
theres
a
big
craze
about
the
ba
version
of
this
but
im
not
sure
i
care
to
find
out
now
yearold
the
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
with
ruby
red
highlights
a
tight
creamy
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
sweet
malt
aromas
hint
at
toffee
and
molasses
while
grapefruit
and
other
citrus
hop
aromas
dance
around
a
touch
of
alcohol
caramel
and
slightly
roasted
malt
flavors
build
a
delectable
level
of
sweetness
that
is
met
by
a
bitter
bite
that
brings
hints
of
grapefruit
cantaloupe
and
pine
resin
well
balanced
this
oneyearold
barleywine
is
leaning
on
being
mediumfull
in
the
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
this
is
the
barelywine
all
other
american
versions
are
measured
against
and
for
good
reason
o
wow
this
is
full
meal
but
im
enjoying
every
sip
i
will
make
this
a
yearly
staple
and
plan
to
kay
a
few
down
from
this
years
batch
o
far
from
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
the
hop
aromaflavor
seems
to
have
faded
but
the
bitterness
is
still
too
strong
great
smelling
though
o
definitely
needs
age
but
i
can
taste
the
potential
and
it
tastes
fantastic
might
have
to
buy
another
and
put
it
away
for
a
year
if
i
can
wait
that
long
on
the
palate
sweetness
from
the
prodigious
malt
bill
hits
first
but
theres
still
enough
hop
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
nicely
this
is
bursting
with
ripe
fruit
character
an
almost
equally
big
citric
hop
flavor
comes
in
toward
the
finish
a
little
bit
of
booziness
thats
appropriate
for
the
style
mouthfeel
features
a
little
bit
of
viscosity
and
a
moderate
but
soft
carbonation
a
good
complement
to
a
big
beer
while
still
reminding
you
that
this
is
beer
not
wine
o
an
excellent
and
huge
beer
new
personal
standard
for
barleywines
and
maybe
my
new
personal
favorite
beer
of
all
time
i
would
like
to
put
some
bottles
back
but
i
cant
resist
their
temptation
overall
its
easy
to
see
why
this
sets
the
standard
for
american
barleywines
and
it
sets
that
bar
pretty
high
o
i
hate
to
rate
it
this
poorly
but
i
calls
em
like
i
sees
em
and
therefore
i
have
no
choice
ive
had
other
vintages
and
its
been
a
good
brew
but
this
one
is
just
not
enjoyable
dont
drink
it
young
overall
a
real
hop
monster
which
is
not
what
i
expected
at
all
this
beer
is
over
three
years
old
hard
to
believe
its
like
a
cross
between
an
american
ipa
and
a
scotch
ale
this
is
great
beer
bursting
with
aroma
flavor
and
character
sailing
on
a
superbly
silky
bed
i
bought
a
4
pack
and
am
curious
how
this
one
will
age
serving
type
12oz
2013
bottle
poured
into
a
dfhsn
ipa
glass
thanks
for
reading
o
sierra
nevadas
bigfoot
is
iconic
and
styledefining
incorporating
their
love
for
the
green
american
hop
cone
of
joy
into
a
deep
malty
beer
this
yearly
release
is
always
worth
collecting
for
present
and
future
enjoyment
as
its
proved
it
will
age
exceptionally
with
time
overall
an
absolute
classic
that
should
be
a
staple
for
the
season
if
you
dont
wish
to
feel
the
shame
of
passing
it
up
im
not
sure
what
sierra
nevada
was
going
for
here
or
how
people
can
actually
enjoy
this
beer
its
an
astringent
mess
with
really
no
barleywine
character
ill
have
to
sit
on
the
other
3
and
see
how
they
age
a
different
sort
of
barleywine
very
malt
driven
but
not
syrupy
sweet
a
very
drinkable
barleywine
its
definitely
quite
bitter
but
also
balanced
out
by
malt
and
strong
as
hell
but
if
you
like
that
type
of
beer
this
is
a
must
try
closest
comparison
i
can
make
is
dfh
burton
baton
which
is
another
favorite
of
mine
i
thought
that
was
creative
overall
bigfoot
was
not
what
i
expected
i
think
i
expected
something
almost
too
sweet
and
way
more
boozy
in
general
this
is
sweet
but
not
syrupy
or
too
much
like
candy
and
the
booze
is
wellhiddenintegrated
its
really
very
good
and
has
many
of
the
elements
that
i
find
so
tasty
in
other
sn
brews
cheers
o
fairly
well
balanced
beer
perhaps
with
some
time
and
aging
the
alcohol
may
dedicate
leaving
it
a
little
smoother
on
the
taste
and
nose
it
was
enjoyable
in
body
scent
and
taste
but
came
up
short
in
feel
overall
a
hoppy
style
barleywine
a
little
on
the
drier
side
while
not
my
favorite
barley
it
is
a
good
drinking
and
enjoyable
brew
o
ive
tried
american
and
english
barleywines
several
times
before
this
is
the
first
time
ive
been
able
to
tolerate
and
even
enjoy
the
style
there
are
many
complex
layers
of
flavor
in
this
beer
almost
to
the
point
of
being
overwhelming
if
you
are
into
dipas
try
experimenting
with
this
style
o
very
nice
hoppier
than
other
bws
ive
had
but
this
is
unique
in
its
own
right
very
well
balanced
and
great
overall
o
great
beer
highley
recommended
o
this
is
a
good
beer
even
if
hops
are
more
than
to
my
liking
not
a
typical
barleywine
so
be
prepared
for
that
o
when
i
need
something
with
some
soul
and
body
i
reach
for
bigfoot
he
knows
how
to
chase
the
baddies
away
another
great
brew
from
sn
overall
good
beer
that
is
well
balanced
looking
forward
to
aging
the
other
bottles
and
trying
this
again
after
it
has
had
some
time
to
mellow
out
this
makes
me
want
to
adventure
out
and
try
some
more
barely
wines
had
a
5
year
old
bigfoot
on
tap
not
quite
as
enjoyable
hops
nearly
faded
to
nothing
felt
heavier
still
liked
it
but
id
like
to
try
one
maybe
aged
a
year
or
2
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
more
on
the
hoppy
side
it
is
a
sn
beer
im
gonna
go
back
after
work
monday
and
hope
they
have
a
couple
more
in
stock
2010s
off
the
shelf
for
2
bucks
cant
really
complain
o
my
kind
of
barleywine
being
the
hophead
that
i
am
its
a
delicious
big
beer
with
lots
of
drinkability
dangerous
combination
zesty
smell
perfect
beer
for
many
occasions
agree
with
the
bros
that
this
will
age
well
will
cellar
the
other
bottle
overall
i
would
have
it
again
at
9
6
abv
its
on
the
low
end
of
alcohol
content
for
a
barley
wine
wouldnt
call
this
an
intense
version
of
this
style
o
my
first
barleywine
very
interesting
as
mainly
an
ipa
drinker
a
lot
of
the
smells
and
flavors
were
things
ive
had
before
but
it
maintained
a
distinct
flavor
that
must
be
barleywine
im
definitely
going
to
venture
out
and
try
more
o
i
liked
it
alot
definitely
plan
on
buying
a
pack
of
this
to
try
aging
for
a
bit
i
was
a
bit
surprised
by
just
how
hoppy
it
was
not
that
i
did
not
like
that
as
i
am
a
huge
hophead
just
surprised
was
expecting
more
of
a
sweet
tasting
drink
this
beer
is
amazing
for
my
first
barleywine
style
ale
this
did
not
turn
me
away
at
all
now
all
i
have
to
do
is
buy
another
4pack
so
i
can
see
how
this
2013
vintage
will
taste
as
the
years
roll
by
overall
this
was
my
first
try
at
a
barleywine
style
ale
nothing
really
exciting
going
on
with
this
according
to
my
taste
but
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
not
one
of
sns
best
products
but
still
well
above
the
norm
o
a
great
relatively
easy
to
drink
barleywine
more
bitter
hop
presence
than
many
in
this
style
but
still
smooth
age
this
and
i
bet
this
will
be
a
great
beer
its
interesting
to
see
how
much
discrepancy
there
is
on
how
this
beer
tastes
ive
seen
mention
on
this
page
of
how
sweetmalty
this
beer
is
while
i
after
tasting
a
fresh
bottle
of
2013
found
it
to
be
dominated
by
bitter
spicy
and
resinous
hops
really
a
wonderful
flavor
but
i
will
be
excited
to
see
how
this
beer
ages
also
how
my
barrelaged
bigfoot
tastes
overall
perhaps
the
first
sierra
nevada
to
let
me
down
not
completely
but
not
nearly
the
best
balanced
barleywine
ive
known
overall
i
have
a
huge
lust
for
barleywines
and
this
one
to
me
is
just
average
i
am
not
going
to
badmouth
it
but
there
is
more
out
there
for
the
same
price
range
just
about
that
i
would
rather
have
i
am
going
to
have
the
barrel
aged
version
of
this
soon
i
hope
it
exceeds
my
expectations
not
a
bad
brew
i
just
want
more
out
of
it
salud
im
not
overly
impressed
with
this
style
and
really
cant
see
any
difference
between
a
dipa
overall
a
very
strong
beer
having
aged
some
bottles
they
do
become
mellower
as
they
age
would
be
nice
to
do
a
3
to
5
year
vertical
comparing
them
malt
complexity
is
overridden
by
the
brutally
bitter
hop
character
some
hop
flavor
is
present
the
phenolic
character
is
slightly
offputting
overall
delivers
on
its
promise
but
a
little
too
bitter
for
my
palate
esters
eventually
save
the
day
overall
there
is
some
sentiment
to
this
beer
i
first
had
it
in
college
in
2001
i
wandered
into
an
acquaintances
dorm
room
who
had
a
late
class
on
a
friday
night
all
of
our
friends
in
the
dorm
had
gone
out
to
party
without
us
so
he
called
in
a
favor
to
a
friend
with
an
id
and
told
him
to
buy
a
sixpack
of
beer
that
had
the
highest
alcohol
content
in
the
store
priorities
in
college
his
friend
soon
delivered
some
bigfoot
and
the
two
of
us
split
the
six
pack
and
then
went
out
to
find
the
rest
of
the
group
3
bigfoots
a
piece
and
we
never
missed
a
beat
once
we
caught
up
to
the
rest
of
our
friends
who
had
been
out
partying
most
of
the
night
the
2013
version
is
much
smoother
than
the
2001
version
and
brings
back
all
the
memories
a
tasty
beer
and
a
welcome
time
machine
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
highly
drinkable
get
it
while
you
can
o
the
hoppiness
of
this
example
of
barleywine
coupled
with
the
balance
of
flavor
albeit
massive
flavor
makes
this
my
benchmark
for
a
fresh
american
style
barleywine
im
very
curious
as
to
how
much
the
hops
mellow
with
a
few
years
of
age
overall
this
is
just
a
great
beer
it
pours
a
murky
brown
with
little
head
smelled
like
brown
sugar
and
booze
im
getting
a
huge
amount
of
unbalanced
bitterness
first
time
trying
this
beer
being
as
fresh
as
it
is
its
extremely
bitter
forward
hoping
this
mellows
out
and
the
flavors
meld
together
harmoniously
oh
its
a
big
beer
alright
im
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
after
so
many
years
apparently
a
few
years
back
this
beer
was
bashed
in
health
crazed
articles
all
over
the
internet
for
being
the
highest
caloric
beer
well
they
also
forgot
to
mention
that
its
one
of
the
most
flavorful
high
caloric
beers
you
can
get
pretty
easily
across
the
us
this
is
everything
i
want
in
a
barleywine
and
its
easy
drinkability
and
everlasting
flavor
makes
it
both
rewarding
and
at
the
same
time
enough
to
make
it
the
only
beer
of
the
night
no
sessionable
traits
here
simply
a
giant
beer
of
epic
proportions
sn
are
forever
beer
gods
for
making
this
eric
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
barleywine
style
ale
the
bottle
says
bigfoot
is
a
beast
of
a
beer
brimming
with
flavor
from
massive
amounts
in
roasted
malt
and
spicy
hops
brewed
in
the
barleywine
style
with
a
rich
bittersweet
body
and
wholecone
pacific
northwest
hops
sweet
malt
up
front
with
chewy
biscuit
mouth
feel
that
sweetness
is
ripped
away
almost
immediately
by
big
pine
resinous
bitter
hops
which
dance
lively
across
the
palate
and
leave
the
finish
dry
earthy
and
nut
almond
notes
are
subtle
but
can
be
sensed
slightly
towards
the
finish
a
very
nice
aggressive
beer
after
three
years
it
is
still
fairly
raw
o
pretty
big
flavors
all
over
the
place
a
bit
palate
taxing
some
time
in
the
bottle
would
definitely
make
it
smoother
as
this
is
pretty
fresh
im
tempted
to
drink
it
sooner
tho
as
i
enjoy
the
hop
profile
more
so
than
the
malt
profile
great
for
the
price
worthy
of
a
once
a
year
price
full
body
nicely
carbonated
even
the
year
old
one
had
more
head
and
still
tons
of
carbonation
alcohol
warmth
is
slightly
there
just
a
great
overall
beer
and
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
had
overall
its
a
complex
beer
worthy
of
praise
very
well
balanced
barleywine
its
sweet
at
first
but
the
hops
and
the
alcohol
come
in
on
the
back
half
to
make
it
an
extremely
worthwhile
sipping
beer
the
flavors
really
come
alive
as
it
warms
drink
this
one
by
the
fire
with
a
robe
on
when
youre
in
a
pensive
mood
o
despite
being
overly
hoppy
when
fresh
it
mellows
out
with
age
and
is
quite
drinkable
across
the
board
i
am
not
a
huge
barleywine
guy
but
this
is
my
go
to
favorite
is
worth
a
try
every
year
and
make
sure
you
grab
enough
to
age
i
cant
wait
to
build
my
vertical
up
to
about
8
years
and
really
see
how
this
thing
handles
over
time
overall
the
standard
for
the
style
and
still
enjoyable
i
first
tried
this
10
years
ago
and
it
is
still
just
as
good
one
of
my
favorite
sierra
beers
if
not
my
very
favorite
of
theirs
i
appreciate
the
american
character
with
the
huge
hop
profile
but
im
thinking
ill
get
another
and
let
it
age
for
a
year
or
so
to
let
the
hop
bite
mellow
id
like
more
malt
to
poke
through
and
blend
with
the
hops
this
beer
is
a
nice
complex
and
very
satisfying
brew
overall
sierra
nevada
deserves
the
hype
their
beers
get
for
the
price
you
cant
go
wrong
o
a
very
good
barleywine
taste
like
a
very
bitter
dipa
overall
a
good
beer
but
quite
hoppy
fresh
will
pick
up
a
couple
to
age
to
see
if
i
can
pull
out
any
of
those
malty
characteristics
worth
trying
at
least
o
dont
quite
understand
the
hoopla
behind
this
one
to
be
honest
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
can
honestly
say
i
will
most
likely
pass
this
one
up
in
the
future
age
will
definitely
improve
this
beer
since
the
alcohol
heat
will
dial
back
a
bit
but
i
am
left
wondering
what
notes
would
really
come
forward
in
its
place
for
me
its
not
worth
the
investment
overall
i
can
definitely
see
why
this
is
one
of
the
definitive
cellarable
beers
theres
a
lot
of
complexity
and
a
lot
of
great
things
going
on
but
it
really
needs
to
mellow
out
just
too
much
grassiness
and
bite
from
the
hops
which
gets
in
the
way
of
the
malt
a
bit
summary
every
year
i
looked
forward
to
the
benchmark
in
barleywines
and
after
the
2012
release
which
was
incredible
in
terms
of
flavor
and
body
i
really
looked
forward
to
stocking
up
on
a
few
cases
of
this
stuff
but
due
to
the
4pack
release
the
increase
in
price
and
the
lack
of
flavor
in
this
years
release
i
actually
stopped
my
plans
dead
in
their
tracks
i
only
picked
up
one
4pack
and
thats
going
to
be
it
for
this
year
a
huge
disappointment
from
s
n
o
certainly
pleased
with
my
first
2013
bigfoot
the
preswallow
taste
is
stupendous
i
am
looking
forward
to
tasting
this
vertically
vs
a
bottle
or
six
from
2012
m
this
is
a
medium
leading
to
full
bodied
brew
the
carbonation
helps
it
drink
lighter
than
it
really
is
o
overall
a
very
solid
beer
this
would
age
very
well
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
id
definitely
have
again
o
the
last
time
i
had
this
one
i
was
painting
my
bathroom
and
frankly
i
think
i
drank
five
of
them
that
ended
with
the
results
that
you
would
expect
but
boy
you
can
see
how
its
easy
to
drink
about
five
in
a
sitting
please
dont
blame
me
for
the
fact
that
its
in
a
four
pack
now
this
is
just
fantastic
stuff
and
im
glad
to
recommend
this
brew
sure
would
be
nice
to
land
some
of
the
barrel
aged
bigfoot
later
this
year
o
not
bad
at
all
im
not
a
huge
barleywine
guy
but
i
can
see
why
people
have
verticals
of
bigfoot
for
years
o
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
ive
got
a
bottle
of
this
years
vintage
to
try
as
well
and
im
very
excited
ill
be
picking
up
some
more
of
both
years
to
sit
on
for
a
while
o
this
4
year
old
bottle
was
given
to
me
as
a
gift
from
a
coworker
after
i
would
toss
him
various
beers
from
my
travels
it
was
great
to
try
an
aged
version
of
the
beer
but
i
much
prefer
the
fresh
big
foot
2012
bottle
enjoyed
pretty
fresh
pours
dark
red
with
creamy
head
on
a
moderately
aggressive
pour
pine
hops
and
caramel
malt
on
the
nose
flavor
is
pretty
dry
and
iwas
expecting
more
sweetness
somewhat
like
a
boozy
rye
pa
with
highlights
on
the
hops
a
bit
of
spice
a
strong
malt
backbone
but
it
doesnt
do
much
for
the
flavor
here
maybe
this
gets
sweeter
with
age
similar
to
an
arrogant
bastard
profile
good
beer
but
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
when
i
cracked
it
tonight
oh
well
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
have
stayed
away
from
barleywines
for
quite
a
while
now
due
to
some
bad
expierences
with
them
deffinetly
loved
this
beer
and
am
disappointed
that
i
just
had
it
for
the
first
time
sierra
nevada
can
do
no
wrong
good
stuff
o
i
must
say
that
this
beer
is
one
that
you
must
buy
if
you
are
new
to
craft
brew
within
the
last
year
ive
had
several
barleywines
and
this
one
was
as
smooth
as
any
personally
one
of
my
favorite
beers
that
ive
had
in
the
past
few
months
which
is
surprising
given
sierra
nevadas
prowill
be
going
back
out
to
buy
a
few
more
4
packs
some
to
drink
and
more
to
cellar
this
is
another
treat
that
makes
me
glad
that
ive
started
branching
into
barleywines
over
the
past
six
months
maybe
not
the
best
ive
tried
but
it
is
top
shelf
the
hops
are
very
enjoyable
now
but
i
can
tell
that
there
is
enough
good
stuff
going
on
that
those
toffee
and
earthy
notes
will
be
right
fine
with
some
age
particularly
once
the
alcohol
has
settled
down
i
know
im
late
to
the
party
this
being
my
first
experience
with
bigfoot
but
i
encourage
anyone
waivering
on
the
decision
to
try
to
take
the
plunge
o
while
i
thought
the
first
few
sips
were
mildly
abrasive
once
my
palette
adjusted
i
really
came
to
enjoy
the
2013
bigfoot
big
hops
over
a
malt
body
smooth
mouthfeel
and
seriously
excellent
lacing
i
would
absolutely
recommend
this
beer
i
still
prefer
an
english
style
barleywine
but
this
is
good
shit
over
all
i
enjoyed
this
ive
not
had
a
lot
of
barley
wine
style
beers
but
because
of
this
i
will
try
others
the
taste
is
malty
up
front
but
the
hop
bitterness
penetrates
the
back
of
my
throat
and
announces
its
presence
in
a
big
way
the
alcohol
is
more
notable
in
the
taste
o
big
and
with
layers
of
complexity
to
keep
things
interesting
a
great
brew
for
the
cold
winter
nights
and
a
style
that
i
hope
more
west
coast
breweries
explore
o
great
beer
i
have
beer
hearing
stories
about
how
people
buy
a
case
of
this
beer
to
do
verticals
as
it
comes
out
in
future
years
i
am
going
to
follow
suit
and
i
suggest
you
do
the
same
roughedged
and
impressively
huge
like
greenflash
barleywine
but
lacking
the
balance
and
polish
of
my
favorite
american
barley
wines
bells
third
coast
old
ale
and
alaskan
barley
wine
o
pretty
good
beer
maybe
some
age
will
help
the
flavors
meld
together
o
good
beer
interesting
take
on
the
style
im
definitely
going
to
sit
on
the
rest
for
a
few
years
and
see
what
happens
boozy
hoppy
and
sweet
does
not
disappoint
but
some
age
might
take
the
edge
off
served
into
a
stone
irs
snifter
o
overall
this
was
very
very
good
this
one
kind
of
surprised
me
although
im
not
quite
sure
why
cause
it
seems
like
most
sn
offerings
i
try
i
find
to
be
quite
good
i
do
think
that
a
lot
of
the
great
characters
in
this
beer
are
hop
driven
so
im
curious
as
to
how
it
will
age
once
those
nice
juicy
hop
notes
fade
i
know
this
is
one
of
the
most
commonly
cellared
beers
but
imo
it
probably
will
decline
with
age
im
going
to
throw
a
couple
in
my
cellar
to
find
out
but
anyways
an
excellent
beer
and
for
the
price
and
availability
it
seems
like
everyone
should
go
out
and
buy
this
beer
now
o
just
about
perfect
perfect
will
be
in
a
year
this
is
a
great
american
barley
wine
perfect
blend
of
traditional
maltiness
and
alcohol
mixed
with
delicious
dry
pine
hop
flavors
cant
wait
for
things
to
mellow
out
over
the
year
its
gonna
be
hard
to
save
this
is
a
nice
take
on
the
american
barleywine
style
and
its
relatively
cheap
for
a
six
pack
i
plan
on
aging
some
of
these
to
see
how
they
pan
out
my
guess
it
that
the
hops
will
fade
a
bit
and
the
brew
will
get
a
little
sweeter
and
hopefully
a
touch
more
mellow
i
only
picked
up
1
bottle
but
im
seriously
considering
getting
a
six
pack
and
storing
some
in
the
cellar
final
thoughts
ive
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
since
hearing
about
it
through
ba
im
not
disappointed
especially
given
the
price
10
for
a
4pack
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
i
have
one
more
in
the
beer
fridge
and
two
aging
in
the
cellar
pours
a
dark
amber
red
with
a
half
finger
of
foam
low
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
spicy
hop
roast
malts
citrus
pine
alcohol
and
some
floral
earthy
tones
pretty
good
smelling
beer
taste
follows
the
aroma
pretty
well
strong
spiced
hop
upfront
melded
with
strong
roasted
and
spicy
malts
some
citrus
undertones
help
mask
the
alcohol
that
makes
the
after
taste
feel
is
thick
and
heavy
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
leaving
a
nice
bite
on
the
tongue
overall
a
really
good
beer
a
reason
its
one
of
sierra
nevadas
signatures
love
the
big
foot
under
the
bottle
cap
i
am
so
impressed
by
this
brew
not
very
far
from
my
favorite
style
and
provides
the
kick
through
its
strength
a
beer
to
fall
in
love
with
for
the
price
personally
i
would
drink
this
as
fresh
as
i
can
get
aging
wouldnt
serve
me
well
as
it
will
take
away
all
of
those
hops
alcohol
and
warmth
overall
would
definitely
have
one
again
ive
heard
that
2
years
is
the
sweet
spot
on
this
one
but
this
is
about
1
year
old
and
tasted
just
fine
cant
wait
for
the
barrel
aged
version
should
be
even
better
overall
this
is
a
solid
american
barleywine
it
will
probably
cellar
well
based
on
the
carbonation
level
present
in
this
beer
fresh
the
huge
hop

will
take
probably
2
to
4
years
to
completely
die
out
of
this
beer
and
bonus
points
for
being
in
single

bottles
instead
of
large
format
bottles
another
solid
sierra
nevada
big
beer
success
no
wonder
why
this
beer
has
such
a
big
following
its
good
fresh
and
probably
even
better
with
many
years
on
it
enjoy
o
i
was
going
to
give
this
beer
a
4
but
as
it
mellows
out
with
warmth
ive
really
come
to
appreciate
all
that
it
has
to
offer
if
it
werent
for
the
bittering
piney
hops
this
beer
would
be
way
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
i
cant
say
enough
how
bitter
sweet
syruppy
malty
alcoholy
this
beer
is
it
also
reminds
me
slightly
of
dogfish
heads
burton
baton
because
of
the
strong
alcoholic
syruppy
caramel
oakiness
its
surprisingly
well
balanced
give
this
sierra
nevada
a
try

there
is
not
a
lot
of
malt
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
booze
the
bottle
was
from
2009
so
im
guessing
its
mellowed
a
little
bit
and
i
like
how
the
booze
cuts
through
the
sweetness
a
little
bit
it
tastes
really
good
as
well
i
would
have
had
a
couple
a
very
good
beer
and
one
that
i
will
most
certainly
try
again

that

and
this
has
made

of
the
brewery
i
put
2
bottles
in

to
see
what
happens
i
can
only

i
would
easily
recommend
this

i
added
the
last
14
of
the
bottle
to
my
glass
near
the
end
of
this
review
o
i
like
the
mouth
on
this
but
feel
like
the
tastes
werent
pronounced
as
in
some
other
barleywines
good
but
not
spectacular
hopefully
with
some
age
it
will
enhance
some
of
the
things
i
was
missing
o
pretty
much
the
standard
of
a
good
barleywine
not
my
favorite
personally
but
pretty
above
average
overall
o
flavor
filled
alcohol
strong
and
still
very
drinkable
awesomely
bold
and
balanced
o
great
beer
that
is
why
several
are
aging
in
my
cellar
this
beer
is
truly
definitive
of
the
stylethis
is
an
american
barleywine
through
and
through
and
a
damn
tasty
one
at
that
im
not
sure
what
more
needs
to
be
said
i
dont
think
this
one
holds
up
to
age
as
well
as
some
other
barleywines
do
but
within
the
first
few
years
or
even
fresh
this
beer
kicks
some
serious
ass
t
i
get
a
big
layer
of
malt
upfront
followed
by
some
pretty
big
notes
of
grapefruit
and
hop
resin
the
finish
is
big
and
bitter
pretty
solid
a
bit
boring
but
im
gonna
age
4
or
so
and
see
what
some
years
do
for
them
i
think
it
will
only
do
them
good
well
see
the
price
is
right
on
them
anyhow
i
might
pick
up
more
to
age
overall
the
only
thing
it
lacks
is
complexity
a
variety
of
flavors
and
it
would
be
spoton
as
it
is
there
not
a
thing
you
can
complain
about
in
this
beer
i
started
with
a
case
and
im
down
to
12
well
see
how
long
they
last
me
2011
vintage
i
cant
believe
its
taken
me
this
long
to
try
the
classic
tbird
of
barleywines
it
pours
an
eversoslightly
hazy
ambergarnet
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
grapefruit
toffee
orange
peel
light
pine
very
light
mint
and
a
touch
of
cantaloupe
the
taste
is
as
though
a
mountain
of
citrusy
hops
grapefruit
pineapple
cantaloupe
and
then
some
pine
as
well
was
thoroughly
drizzled
with
thick
sweet
caramel
a
nice
balance
with
a
sizable
though
not
oerwhelming
amount
of
booziness
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
creamy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
bwine
one
that
is
more
than
deserving
of
its
status
doverall
ive
heard
great
things
about
this
beer
but
it
just
wasnt
doing
itfor
me
tonight
i
will
visit
this
again
but
felt
it
was
too
bitter
to
enjoy
especially
as
it
got

i
am
not

fan
of
american
barleywines
finding
them
to
be
a

harsh
but
this
one
wasnt
at
all
now
to
resist
cracking
the
others
i
have
left
so
i
can
age
them
0a
great
brew
with
tremendous
flavor
and
bitterness
steer
very
clear
if
bitter
beers
arent
your
thing
otherwise
give
it
a
try
the
mouthfeel
is
very
fullbodied
with
a
bit
of
smoothness
from
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
such
a
big
beer
overall
a
great
beer
looking
forward
to
having
some
of
these
aged
a
fantastic
beer
to
sit
and
savour
great
for
hopheads
given
the
high
hop
rates
and
high
alcohol
strength
recommend
you
try
this
if
you
see
it
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
both
fresh
and
with
age
fresh
its
like
and
extreme
iipa
due
to
the
hop
profile
and
the
malt
sweetness
in
the
backbone
it
becomes
more
of
a
barleywine
with
age
since
the
hop
character
settles
a
bit
either
way
its
a
damn
fine
brew
that
i
seek
out
several
6
packs
of
every
year
o
overall
i
liked
this
beer
but
found
it
too
strong
to
finish
between
the
substantial
content
of
malt
sweetness
and
hops
bitterness
and
the
dense
mouthfeel
i
could
only
take
small
sips
of
this
beer
moreover
i
only
think
i
made
it
about
half
way
through
the
bottle
because
the
beer
was
so
intense
i
think
my
bigfoot
would
have
been
considerably
more
enjoyable
if
it
had
been
aged
for
at
least
a
year
my
bottle
was
from
the
2011
batch
i
can
tell
much
care
went
into
making
this
beer
and
i
hope
ill
be
able
to
drink
a
bigfoot
some
time
in
the
future
that
has
been
aged
for
a
year
or
more
overall
a
great
drink
but
because
of
the
full
body
and
high
abv
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
d
hells
yea
i
love
this
beer
this
is
the
first
barelywine
that
i
wasnt
disgusted
by
because
the
alcohol
killed
all
of
my
senses
overall
this
is
very
good
i
buy
a
six
pack
or
more
each
year
and
i
always
enjoy
it
edit
after
having
several
different
barleywines
both
english
and
american
style
i
had
a
fresh
2012
bottle
and
still
think
this
is
the
most
hop
forward
take
on
the
style
yet
its
like
the
american
style
taken
to
the
extreme
i
look
forward
to
trying
an
aged
one
sometime
overall
with
about
5
months
on
it
bigfoot
still
has
a
proper
hop
profile
and
is
enjoyable
there
is
a
huge
malt
backbone
to
balance
the
hops
but
they
are
still
balanced
at
this
point
d
the
tits
amazing
beer
1st
barleywine
ever
and
wont
be
the
last
overall
i
though
this
was
a
pretty
good
barleywine
pretty
much
all
the
barleywines
i
have
had
have
all
been
heavy
on
the
malts
and
malt
forward
in
this
brew
the
malts
take
a
back
seat
to
the
hops
i
think
i
like
the
malts
forward
barleywines
better
but
i
can
still
appreciate
the
complexitys
of
this
highly
hopped
barleywine
i
fell
like
the
malt
heavy
ones
are
better
suited
for
the
colder
temperatures
of
the
winter
while
this
highly
hopped
one
seems
better
suited
for
those
cooler
summer
nights
around
the
camp
fire
each
one
has
its
own
good
time
and
place
i
dont
know
if
this
beer
is
that
drinkable
but
since
it
is
not
as
sweet
as
some
of
the
other
ones
i
have
had
i
could
see
cracking
another
one
if
i
had
it
if
i
can
find
a
6
pack
i
think
i
will
buy
it
this
would
make
a
great
summertime
barleywine
if
you
like
your
barleywines
hop
forward
then
this
is
the
brew
for
you
hell
if
you
just
a
fan
of
barleywines
in
general
you
should
try
this
this
was
a
great
solid
beer
from
sierra
nevada
i
would
like
to
throw
a
couple
of
these
in
the
cellar
to
see
how
this
brew
stacks
up
once
the
hops
start
to
fade
i
am
willing
to
bet
it
will
taste
even
better
but
completely
different
this
is
up
their
with
torpedo
for
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
sierra
nevada
edit
the
2012
version
is
just
as
good
and
even
more
intesence
since
this
one
was
much
fresher
the
2011
i
had
last
year
through
and
through
one
of
the
best
looking
barleywines
and
a
really
intense
beer
aroma
is
fruity
with
an
undertone
of
malt
and
a
firm
hint
of
molasses
it
pours
a
pretty
dark
brownish
amber
almost
mahogany
with
a
thick
fluffy
fairly
persistent
white
head
luscious
flavor
is
fruity
and
woody
with
hints
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
alcohol
bite
is
present
and
a
bit
tinny
but
not
as
strong
as
with
most
barleywines
which
is
a
plus
texture
is
smooth
fizzy
and
edgy
leaving
a
tingly
and
woody
finish
i
for
one
recommend
this
to
barleywine
lovers
deep
amber
pour
with
a
tinge
of
ruby
with
an
offwhite
two
finger
head
that
has
good
retention
and
great
lacing
lots
of
citrus
in
the
nose
specifically
tangerines
with
a
solid
sweet
malty
backbone
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
intense
huge
resiny
tangy
spicy
hop
bitterness
with
a
good
measure
of
pine
and
orange
peel
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
this
is
all
nicely
complemented
by
a
syrupy
malt
sweetness
that
tries
to
tame
the
intense
bitterness
this
thing
really
opens
up
nicely
as
it
warms
a
thick
and
chewy
sipper
with
a
subtle
alcohol
burn
a
classic
interpretation
of
the
style
yet
another
winner
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
overall
a
pretty
decent
brew
its
easily
drinkable
but
the
high
abv
is
not
all
that
wellhidden
so
exercise
caution
with
this
guy
i
can
almost
taste
the
bigfoot
in
this
beer
pours
a
mildly
transparent
ruddy
brown
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
retention
is
typical
for
a
high
abv
beer
and
it
leaves
a
little
lacing
in
my
glass
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
with
hints
of
grassy
and
citrus
hops
taste
starts
with
a
bit
of
the
complex
hops
then
it
shifts
to
the
malty
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
just
right
and
carbonation
is
mild
overall
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
but
the
price
point
and
availability
make
it
exceptional
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
barleywines
that
ive
had
its
the
epitome
of
the
style
very
tasty
a
little
lower
in
drinkability
because
of
the
9
6
abv
ill
be
picking
up
a
six
pack
of
this
next
year
updated
my
score
accordingly
overall
i
enjoyed
this
i
would
like
to
set
this
one
aside
for
a
while
and
try
it
again
it
wont
matter
if
the
hop
flavors
fade
i
think
the
rest
of
it
may
mesh
a
bit
more
pick
this
one
up
if
you
get
the
chance
overall
a
very
good
barleywine
i
can
see
why
people
are
so
crazy
about
it
i
enjoyed
it
and
will
definitely
look
for
it
in
the
future
overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
and
this
beer
is
worthy
of
the
praise
that
it
gets
o
this
is
one
amazing
beer
each
time
i
drink
this
it
just
reminds
me
of
how
awesome
it
truly
is
in
my
opinion
the
best
american
barleywine
out
there
o
overall
bigfoot
never
dissapoints
and
this
year
is
right
on
point
really
like
the
fact
that
this
is
a
hopped
up
barleywine
and
doesnt
have
the
aforementioned
syrup
qualities
that
most
brews
of
this
style
typically
have
not
that
that
is
a
bad
thing
as
a
mtter
of
fact
it
is
a
quality
i
come
to
expect
and
love
when
im
in
the
bwine
kind
of
mood
that
being
said
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
change
and
i
have
layed
a
couple
of
this
years
vintage
down
in
the
cellar
to
see
how
they
develop
cheers
the
alcohol
content
adds
a
nice
warming
affect
on
the
way
down
it
poured
a
cherry
brown
in
color
with
a
nice
three
finger
cream
colored
head
the
foam
sat
atop
the
glass
for
a
good
three
to
four
minutes
before
dissipating
enough
to
drink
the
aromas
are
very
sweet
and
full
of
raisins
especially
you
also
get
sweet
carmel
malts
and
cherries
unfortunately
the
flavors
arent
quite
as
complex
you
get
a
boatload
of
sweet
malts
oak
vanilla
caramel
and
candied
sugar
but
its
hard
to
get
past
the
sweetness
this
three
year
old
barleywine
drinks
a
little
flatter
than
id
like
its
lost
considerable
carbonation
throughout
time
overall
this
is
definitely
a
solid
barleywine
but
its
very
very
sweet
and
too
sweet
for
my
liking
tasting
verticals
of
bigfoot
through
the
years
is
fun
to
watch
and
taste
the
change
can
be
pretty
considerable
pours
a
deep
dark
amber
that
only
shows
through
the
light
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
that
has
a
great
retention
the
aroma
holds
a
great
deal
of
caramel
malt
some
citrus
and
some
dark
fruit
the
flavor
holds
a
great
balance
between
a
grapefruitgrass
hop
flavor
and
caramel
malt
theres
also
elements
of
plum
brandy
and
alcohol
full
bodied
and
supermalty
over
the
tounge
with
a
bitter
finish
gives
this
brew
a
great
bittersweet
experience
over
all
truly
the
quintessential
american
style
barleywine
this
years
batch
seems
less
yeasty
or
malt
forward
than
i
remember
previous
versions
being
this
could
be
due
to
its
freshness
and
the
fact
that
a
9
6
abv
just
seems
so
average
to
my
palette
now
it
is
very
hoppy
fresh
and
it
is
really
quite
excellent
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
sierra
nevada
beers
seasonal
or
otherwise
overall
this
is
quite
interesting
and
enjoyable
im
glad
i
have
2
more
o
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
flavor
but
at
first
i
didnt
know
if
i
was
a
fan
of
the
balance
it
seemed
too
heavy
on
the
sweetness
for
my
taste
a
few
drinks
in
though
the
flavors
expanded
a
bit
and
opened
up
a
more
enjoyable
experience
its
a
beer
that
grew
on
me
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
strange
but
true
now
id
be
perfectly
content
with
a
sixpack
of
these
monsters
funny
how
it
works
sometimes
overall
the
most
impressive
thing
about
this
brew
was
the
deep
gorgeous
coloring
it
had
the
darkness
of
the
style
but
a
beautiful
glowing
red
to
give
that
extra
glam
the
aroma
was
also
nice
with
a
slight
fruitiness
and
spice
amongst
the
hoppiness
and
grain
this
brew
really
opened
up
the
more
it
sat
and
warmed
to
the
proper
temperature
much
more
so
than
other
beers
of
this
style
what
it
eventually
became
was
a
nice
treat
with
a
warming
aroma
and
taste
that
keeps
you
wanting
more
overall
medium
to
fullbodied
and
leaning
on
the
fullbodied
side
hops
are
tingly
and
the
aftertaste
of
the
hops
last
a
long
time
a
very
good
drinkable
barleywine
disclaimer
this
is
my
first
barleywine
and
i
like
it
a
lot
that
means
two
things
i
may
not
be
describing
it
in
proper
terms
and
ill
be
buying
many
more
to
compare
so
i
may
have
to
revisit
this
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
rich
very
full
chewy
do
i
know
the
calorie
count
on
this
one
is
huge
but
it
definitely
cant
stop
me
from
drinking
a
few
of
these
cant
wait
to
put
12
away
to
see
how
they
age
but
the
other
ones
wont
last
very
long
d
this
is
a
tough
beer
to
review
it
is
such
an
achetypical
classic
of
its
particular
style
that
it
is
hard
to
give
it
an
objective
examination
still
like
a
beatles
album
there
is
a
reason
it
has
become
a
classic
that
is
a
standard
bearer
for
all
that
followed
the
spicy
hop
character
is
brimming
with
pine
and
more
subtle
darker
character
that
is
both
influenced
by
and
harmonizes
with
the
deep
sugary
malt
this
is
a
timeless
and
complex
beer
that
is
all
the
more
notable
in
that
it
doesnt
require
extensive
aging
to
become
drinkable
the
way
that
some
other
classic
american
barleywines
do
o
finally
got
to
try
this
beast
very
well
hopped
fresh
cant
wait
to
see
what
a
year
or
2
does
to
this
o
overall
this
tastes
like
the
quintessential
american
barleywine
it
manages
to
be
hoppy
syrupy
desertlike
drinkable
and
balanced
all
in
one
much
better
than
most
barleywines
ive
tried
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
or
cellared
for
a
year
this
is
not
an
everyday
beer
but
a
treat
for
the
right
moment
i
will
certainly
be
tempted
to
pick
up
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
next
time
i
see
this
overall
way
too
bitter
for
my
own
choice
but
seems
to
be
very
true
to
the
style
which
is
something
i
can
very
much
appreciate
good
brew
and
great
if
you
love
bitters
the
first
time
i
ever
tried
a
sierra
nevada
let
alone
bigfoot
i
was
not
impressedi
think
i
was
because
at
that
time
i
was
pounding
pbr
mickeys
and
high
life
but
as
the
seasons
changed
i
slowly
became
the
beer
geeks
that
i
am
today
bigfoots
color
is
a
deep
cloudy
red
with
a
pale
orange
2
inch
head
it
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
at
the
beginning
then
i
got
a
toasty
feeling
towards
and
at
the
end
though
the
taste
is
a
liitle
strong
for
me
i
point
out
that
a
im
drinking
it
at
room
temp
out
of
my
favorite
laser
etched
pint
glass
and
b
i
can
only
assume
that
because
of
my
general
lack
of
drinking
any
sierra
nevada
styles
it
make
me
a
noob
to
this
good
beer
i
plan
on
buying
another
bottle
and
cellaring
it
there
are
a
lot
of
good
barleywine
style
beers
but
bigfoot
still
sets
the
standard
from
the
unique
color
to
the
wonderful
smells
to
the
very
sierra
nevada
interpretation
of
barleywine
flavor
this
beer
does
it
all
its
strong
bold
and
yet
remains
a
delicate
treat
to
be
savored
again
and
again
the
best
thing
about
the
beer
is
the
recipe
has
slight
modifications
every
year
yet
remains
consistently
interesting
and
awesome
this
is
for
the
true
craft

the

thick
and
chewy
in

with
each
sip
slight

overall
this
is
a
good
barleywine
that
packs
a
hop
punch
one
of
the
hoppiest
of
the
style
that
i
have
tried
alcohol
comes
in
late
with
a
slight
warming
in
the
stomach
some
aging
will
likely
smooth
but
am
pleasantly
surprised
didnt
think
i
would
enjoy
as
much
as
i
do
d
heavy
on
the
abv
so
its
sipper
dont
be
bonging
these
overall
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
barley
wines
ive
ever
had
and
i
mean
that
citrusy
and
woody
hops
hit
the
nose
first
almost
like
a
juicy
fresh
harvest
ale
caramel
and
spicy
alcohol
are
clearly
detectable
as
well
taste
is
much
sweeter
than
the
nose
and
it
starts
out
syrupy
before
the
bitterness
dries
out
the
finish
i
must
admit
the
bitterness
and
alcohol
burning
is
a
little
more
than
id
like
mouthfeel
is
good
and
certainly
holds
up
to
the
rest
of
the
flavors
but
i
may
hang
on
to
one
of
these
for
a
few
years
to
let
the
harsh
finish
mellow
out
notes
delicious
west

super
hoppy
barleywine
high

but
the
hop
bitterness
wipe
off
the
alcohol
warmth
dangerously
delicious
o
still
on
of
my
favorite
barleywines
and
i
see
why
so
many
people
have
embraced
it
this
was
totally
my
bridge
beer

the
sides
smells
of
caramel
malts

a

bit
of
roasted
malt
hops
shine
in
the
american
barleywine
raging
through
with
pine
and
grass
type
hops
taste
is
ridiculous
crazy
so
many
malt
notes
bundled
up
in
one
beer
compiled
with
the
immense
amount
of
hopping
should
be
illegal
just
to
make
it
more
fun
to
partake
this
beer
is
a
wicked
treat
i
remember
when
i
was
getting
into
english
barleys
and
picked
up
one
of
these
monsters
i
was
flabbergasted
i
had
no
idea
what
was
going
on
in
my
mouth
other
than
an
explosion
of
flavors
overall
this
is
one
heavy
monstrous
brew
and
should
be
handled
with
care
yes
we
all
know
it
tastes
so
delectably
good
that
youll
want
to
have
a
few
but
trust
me
my
friends
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
not
to
get
too
hammered
on
this
potent
poison
youll
thank
me
tomorrow
cheers
this
beer
is
pretty
freaking
intense
had
a
new
bottle
of
this
back
in
2008
and
it
was
really
potent
to
me
the
appearance
of
the
beer
was
a
muddy
golden
color
with
some
brown
in
there
the
head
was
white
and
had
some
good
retention
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
really
hoppy
for
a
barley
wine
the
other
aromas
if
any
where
difficult
to
pick
out
the
flavor
was
big
and
bitey
there
was
a
lot
of
complexity
in
here
there
were
hops
and
malts
colliding
there
was
some
dark
fruits
in
the
aftertaste
lingering
around
it
was
pretty
different
from
anything
i
had
tried
prior
to
this
its
an
impressive
brew
wish
i
would
have
aged
one
from
years
ago
to
see
if
it
mellows
out
over
time
12
oz
bottle
2011
version
pours
a
dark
reddish
amber
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
has
very
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
aroma
is
caramel
malt
a
strong
breadiness
and
some
pine
hops
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
orange
the
initial
taste
is
sweet
with
caramel
that
goes
into
some
light
pine
and
a
bit
of
breadiness
the
finish
is
pretty
bitter
with
some
alcohol
heat
medium
body
mediumlow
carbonation
an
enjoyable
beer
but
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
it
overall
i
think
that
this
beer
has
caught
a
bad
reputation
for
being
a
hop
bomb
really
once
you
get
past
the
aroma
it
isnt
all
that
hoppy
it
isnt
a
great
beer
but
it
can
be
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
another
if
only
to
investigate
what
other
subtle
flavors
are
present
of
course
ill
make
sure
to
have
a
bottle
of
water
ready
to
rid
my
mouth
of
the
aftertaste
looks
like
this
one
has
lots
of
fans
but
i
have
to
be
honest
and
not
follow
the
crowd
i
dont
think
the
big
flavors
integrated
well
together
there
was
a
lot
going
on
in
many
directions
and
it
seemed
muddled
up
the
beer
was
almost
amber
with
great
clarity
a
small
tan
head
fast
fading
retention
and
little
lace
the
smell
was
amazing
tons
of
hops
citrus
pine
floral
and
grassy
lemon
and
grapefruit
pear
and
green
apple
with
a
nice
sweet
caramel
and
honey
in
the
back
the
taste
just
didnt
come
together
right
for
me
it
was
hard
to
finish
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
behind
the
hop
bomb
but
the
hops
was
all
over
the
place
bitter
grapefruit
with
lemon
notes
resiny
pine
and
green
apple
were
fighting
hints
of
pear
caramel
and
honey
just
didnt
make
a
smooth
mix
hints
of
butterscotch
and
a
slight
burn
of
alcohol
light
fruity
characters
just
too
much
going
on
oily
and
slick
overall
was
hard
to
finish
for
me
too
over
the
top
for
my
taste
buds
this
beer
sets
the
standard
for
american
barley
wines
o
this
beer
is
hopped
to
the
point
i
cant
seem
to
make
a
differentiation
between
a
dipa
and
an
american
barleywine
notwithstanding
that
fact
it
still
makes
a
great
powerful
brew
that
will
knock
you
out
pours
with
very
little
head
or
lacing
appearing
cloudy
and
kind
of
like
dark
apple
cider
smell
is
a
lot
of
red
and
dark
dried
fruit
and
rich
caramel
taste
is
mostly
caramel
and
decadent
toffee
surprisingly
theres
still
a
dose
of
bitterness
which
sits
strong
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
finishes
incredibly
dry
which
accentuates
the
bitterness
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
main
things
i
dont
like
about
bigfoot
overall
this
is
a
big
improvement
imho
over
fresh
or
yearold
bigfoot
but
still
only
an
average
barleywine
the
alcohol
at
9
6
was
concealed
well
but
produced
a
little
warmth
in
the
back
of
the
throat
drinkable
and
pleasant
in
the
mouth
as
this
beer
ages
it
mellows
nicely
its
robust
flavors
round
out
and
flow
together
while
certainly
a
great
beer
fresh
a
year
or
two
does
wonders
i
have
several
years
of
this
particular
beer
but
i
decided
to
finally
review
the
newest
edition
pours
a
very
respectable
deep
amber
with
a
nice
one
finger
white
lacing
the
longer
you
let
the
beer
warm
up
the
better
it
becomes
after
20
minutes
the
beer
has
settled
into
a
nice
rhythm
the
balance
of
the
malts
and
hops
give
a
very
balanced
beer
especially
for
it
being
the
newest
edition
the
taste
is
a
parallel
of
the
smell
with
a
nice
smooth
balance
of
flavors
that
ends
in
smoothly
with
a
hint
of
sharp
alcohol
flavoring
if
the
beer
tastes
this
good
as
a
newcomer
i
cant
wait
to
taste
it
in
a
few
years
o
this
is
a
beer
that
your
gonna
wanna
sit
back
sip
and
let
warm
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
barleywine
drinkable
for
what
it
is
but
not
something
i
would
drink
more
than
one
of
because
it
would
probably
get
to
warm
and
sweet
tasting
which
i
dont
like
a
great
beer
i
would
definitely
have
again
sometime
definitely
pick
it
up
if
your
into
barleywines
and
sipping
brews
cheers
a
young
bigfoot
that
leaves
its
mark
not
only
on
your
pallete
but
in
your
head
great
beer
future
outlook
seems
like
a
bargain
beer
in
relative
terms
and
one
that
might
stand
the
test
of
time
quite
well
to
boot
time
to
grab
some
more
of
these
to
stow
away
for
a
few
years
o
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
no
doubt
i
was
pretty
disappointed
with
the
taste
just
being
a
hop
bomb
when
the
smell
was
so
goodcomplex
maybe
it
needs
a
little
more
time
to
age
i
will
give
it
another
shot
in
a
few
months
and
edit
if
necessary
quite
good
worth
trying
i
like
it
but
its
too
hoppy
for
my
kind
of
barleywine
im
excited
to
save
a
few
for
aging
and
see
how
the
hopforward
brew
ages
m
thick
slightly
syrupy
with
light
carbonation
nearly
perfect
for
what
i
look
for
in
a
barleywine
well
it
is
drinkable
heavy
bodied
and
heavy
flavors
for
a
9
6
beer
but
that
is
a
positive
in
this
case
worthy
of
aging
although
you
wont
find
me
buying
a
whole
case
of
it
every
year
a
deserving
treat
and
a
great
break
from
the
stouts
that
dominate
the
winter
while
the
real
bigfoot
has
yet
to
be
captured
his
mystical
nature
and
popularity
have
been
captured
by
this
beer
well
done
sn
well
done
much
like
the
elusive
nature
of
bigfoot
himself
this
one
is
worthy
of
hiding
in
your
cellar
for
years
to
come
o
a
great
barleywine
by
sierra
nevada
the
other
5
bottles
from
the
six
pack
are
going
in
the
cellar
to
age
sticky
feel
afterward
from
the
hops
and
the
sugar
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
two
finger
head
the
aroma
is
of
piney
and
earthy
hops
it
is
a
big
hop
smell
almost
like
a
double
ipa
there
is
a
little
sweetness
to
the
smell
the
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
a
big
earthy
hop
presence
up
front
no
taste
of
alcohol
at
all
at
the
end
you
get
a
little
malt
taste
but
not
very
much
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
moderately
carbonated
overall
it
is
solid
but
i
felt
it
was
more
along
the
line
of
a
double
ipa
than
a
barleywine
you
really
had
to
search
for
any
type
of
balance
from
the
malt
one
was
a
good
drink
but
i
couldnt
go
two
overall
its
a
great
beer
but
i
would
plan
on
drinking
a
few
because
other
beer
wont
taste
right
after
this
beast
o
wish
this
tasted
like
it
smells
and
that
i
had
the
capacity
to
cellar
this
for
a
couple
of
years
i
know
it
has
potential
its
just
not
there
when
fresh
overall
this
was
a
very
good
barley
wine
style
ale
and
my
favorite
so
far
of
the
3
ive
tried
from
this
style
old
guardian
belgo
og
my
first
bigfoot
hopefully
not
my
last
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
over
a
bit
of
time
hop
leaning
but
well
balanced
with
tons
of
sweet
caramel
toffee
and
toasty
malts
such
a
big
full
flavored
beer
that
is
ohso
smooth
after
having
many
of
these
aged
i
actually
think
i
like
it
fresh
the
best
it
took
me
8
years
of
drinking
bigfoot
to
realize
that
but
i
really
like
the
fresh
hop
profile
and
supremely
balanced
malt
without
any
oxidation
taking
hold
an
american
original
for
sure
but
some
other
barleywines
have
perfected
what
sn
started
since
then
rambling
i
know
just
reflecting
on
the
crazy
growth
of
craft
beer
over
the
past
decade
still
a
great
beer
that
i
will
continue
to
buy
1
or
2
sixers
of
every
year
o
simply
put
a
classic
american
barleywine
it
would
be
interesting
to
taste
three
or
four
examples
side
by
side
with
more
years
between
them
as
one
year
doesnt
show
lots
of
evolution
edit
i
like
this
beer
a
whole
lot
better
with
a
year
or
two
of
age
as
the
hops
fade
i
like
it
a
whole
lot
more
o
really
nice
beer
im
glad
i
got
a
sixer
so
i
can
age
the
rest
for
some
time
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
slight
haze
from
the
sediment
and
has
a
thick
finger
of
very
airy
foam
the
nose
is
heavy
with
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
plumb
and
pear
give
your
first
gulp
a
few
seconds
and
you
feel
the
alcohol
sliding
down
the
gullet
the
taste
and
body
are
nice
and
thick
i
can
see
why
this
brew
gets
some
of
the
accolades
it
does
pours
from
the
stubby
12
oz
bottle
a
dark

color
with
a
thick
slightly
off
white
one

head
that
settles
into
a
heavy
collar
and
leaving
thick
lacing

carbonation
is
mild
aroma
is
of
sweet
clean
malt
mixed
with
a
nice
balance
of
citrus
hops
1st
sip
brings
a
tart
dry
blast
of
citrus
pine
soaked
hops
as
the
beer
lingers
on
the
tongue
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
sweet
caramel
bit
the
hops
push
it
way
into
the
background
there
is
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
on
the
swallow
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
with
a
slight
carbonation
sparkle
drinkability
is
limited
due
to
the
alcohol
burn
im
reviewing
this
freshly
bought
a
few
months
or
couple
years
of
aging
would
have
an
interesting
effect
i
believe
so
im
gonna
save
one
or
two
of
these
to
sample
in
2012
or
2013
and
see
if
they
mellow
some
overall
a
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
legendary
hype
o
drank
this
with
a
friend
and
we
both
couldnt
shut
up
about
how
great
it
is
definitely
holds
up
to
previous
years
and
its
a
powerhouse
of
flavor
and
booze
thats
great
for
a
cool
spring
evening
save
it
for
the
end
of
the
session
overall
not
my
favorite
barleywine
but
certainly
a
must
have
every
year
i
would
definitely
recomment
this
to
anyone
looking
to
get
into
the
style
i
will
revisit
and
enjoy
each
one
this
review
is
dedicated
to
michael
miller
the
person
that
introduced
me
to
craft
and
to
bigfoot
d
i
drank
this
beer
at
about
60
degrees
f
i
recommend
you
try
the
same
this
beer
needs
some
warmth
to
really
open
up
it
is
a
phenomenal
beer
and
reminds
of
why
sierra
nevada
is
such
a
great
brewery
i
will
age
some
of
the
remainders
and
see
how
this
beer
evolves
over
the
years
i
love
this
beer
poured
with
very
nice
lacing
wrapping
the
sides
of
glass
with
a
good
carb
light
amber
color
and
hints
of
piney
hops
not
as
winey
as
usual
barleywines
but
still
amazing
overall
great
balance
between
hops
and
malts
i
have
6
left
gonna
let
3
age
and
see
how
they
change
pretty
exciting
there
is
a
lot
of
hype
about
this
beer
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
exactly
what
i
expect
a
barley
wine
to
be
the
appearance
was
a
good
medium
or
dark
amber
with
subtle
ruby
highlights
the
smell
was
almost
over
powered
with
hops
which
seemed
out
of
place
for
the
style
the
body
and
mouth
feel
were
very
nice
but
once
again
the
taste
was
almost
over
powered
by
hops
again
a
bit
out
of
place
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
that
aside
this
beer
if
labeled
differently
say
maybe
an
imperial
ipa
or
a
specialty
ipa
is
a
repeat
drink
i
do
love
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
hops
but
for
them
to
be
this
present
in
a
barley
wine
just
seems
to
be
odd
note
2011
vintage
overall
i
liked
this
beer
im
thinking
i
definately
would
like
it
better
with
some
age
on
it
a
bit
to
hoppy
for
a
barleywine
for
mebut
i
still
really
liked
this
craft
beer
classic
mouthfeel
and
taste
is
really
good
starts
off
big
and
full
it
seems
really
thick
and
viscous
the
carbonation
is
very
fine
like
champagne
mousse
but
at
a
very
good
level
that
really
helps
to
build
the
beer
bitterness
sits
on
the
edges
of
the
big
taste
all
the
way
to
the
very
intense
finish
big
bitter
finish
good
beer
i
look
forward
to
trying
older
vintages
in
the
future
this
is
a
goood
alenot
sold
in
my
town
but
i
will
drive
the
26
miles
to
get
more
people
that
drink
girl
friend
beer
want
like
this
ale
a
dreat
looking
beer
with
a
nice
clear
amber
with
some
red
tones
nice
big
head
that
laced
the
glass
a
bit
i
thought
the
carbination
was
a
little
too
much
and
was
not
expecting
so
much
hoppiness
i
had
heard
about
this
beer
and
had
only
a
few
other
barleywines
to
compare
it
against
but
this
was
not
as
complex
as
the
offering
i
had
from
lagunitas
o
i
will
be
laying
down
at
least
one
of
these
bottles
in
hopes
that
it
gets
better
with
age
the
others
will
go
to
enemies
gotta
say
i
am
an
english
bw
type
of
guy
that
is
all
about
the
malts
so
needless
to
say
i
dont
care
for
bigfoot
fresh
however
w
4
years
of
age
this
brew
is
starting
to
become
pretty
enjoyable
i
bet
my
1993
bottle
will
be
sublime
iso
pre
2007
bigfoot
overall
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
as
noted
a
bit
too
hopforward
for
my
personal
taste
but
i
can
see
where
a
little
age
would
take
this
beer
to
another
level
i
intend
to
test
that
theory
onot
bad
definitely
needs
some
age
im
storing
another
for
a
year
and
we
will
see
how
it
goes
cheers
in
my
opinion
all
beer
looks
good
flavorful
hopefully
on
an
annual
basis

bitter
bliss
its
remarkeble
given
its

the

a
barleywine
goes
this
is
for
you
fresh
the
pine
aspect
in
this
one
was
huge
a
definite
must
try
but
it
just
is
not
ready
to
drink
when
fresh
its
just
to
hoppy
and
hot
and
the
malt
character
is
a
little
boring
i
could
split
one
of
these
and
be
content
nicely
balanced
for
such
a

i
thought
this
was
really
good
my
husband
who
hates
barleywines
given
the
abv
but
that
doesnt
hinder
the
drinkability
this
is
a
very
bitter
beer
but
not
a
gulper
this
ones
a
sipper
due
to
the
high
booze
effect
i
certainly
would
not
want
more
than
two
in
a
sitting
i
might
have
to
give
that
a
try
not
sure
what
to
think
i
like
it
light
in
the
mouth
but
still
a
tasty
brew
none

less

though
not

it

is

2011
is
more
double
ipa
than

at
this
time
the
hops
will
certainly
fade
in
this
beer
and
the
malt
will
begin
to
come
to
the
forefront
as
the
beer
becomes
more
complex
with
age
i
plan
to
save
a
couple
bottles
to
do
a
vertical
tasting
and
compare
to
this
review
in
a

definitely
the
right
beer
for
the

but
my

preference
says

the

smacks
you

very

of

actually
this

if

ale
and
want
that
same
taste
but
with
even
more
bitter
hops
and
and
that
same
malt
but
a
lot
more
of
it
this
is
your
beer
actually
the
celebration

and
this
beer
have
the

ingredients
they
both
use
two

and
english
barley
with
the

if

it
was

a

blast

discovered
in

sips
barely

the
flavor
to

leans
towards

ah
the
dilemma
of
grading
a
beer
on
its
current
state
or
its
potential
since
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
sipping
on
many
bigfoot
vintages
going
back
to
the
clinton
administration
im
going
to
opt
for
the
latter
this
is
a
raw
rookie
with
loads
of
potential
that
shows
flashes
of
brilliance
but
still
needs
time
to
develop
i
will
quite
happily
finish
my
sixer

but
its
not
bad
but
that
is
to
the
style
as
this

american

the
booze
is
nearly
nonexistent
in
the
flavor
but
the
effects
are
soon
felt
in
all
this
is
a
really
smooth
slightly
chewy
and
with
a
carbonation
kick
right
at
the
end
this
is
a
great
beer
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
strong

for

it

outright
impact

buds

the
aroma

me
to
seem
somewhat
nondescript
the
usual
citrus
was
not
pronounced
in
this
tulip
glassful
i
did
get
some
mild
malt
sweetness

color

its

once
the
head
had
gotten
to
about
one
finger
of
thick
foam
it
never
dissipated
sticky
lacing
is
left
everywhere
in

smell
is

pure
hops

grapefruit

pine
with

presence
and
lightly
sweet

the
taste
is
every
bit
as
complex
hops
bitterness
is
strong
but
the
flavors
it
brings
out
are
glorious
underlying
is
the
malt
adding
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
theres
a
certain
earthiness
to
this
brew
as
well
and
light
biscuit
toastiness
with
some
subtle
fruit
flavors
round
it
out
one
of
the
most
balanced
brews
ive
ever
tasted
i
cant
stress
the
purity
of
the
hops
im
picturing
raw
young
green
buds
right
off
the
plant
by
the
by
this
claims
9
6
abv
and
i
can
barely
tell
as
an
aftertaste
impressive
theres
nothing
remotely
astringent
about
this
brew
drink
this
now
and
live
mouthfeel
not
over
carbonated
which
is
appropriate
for
this
style
this
ale
was
made
for
the
most
pure
enjoyment
that
anyone
can
have
with
a
beer
if
you
wanna
sit
back
and
relax
with
an
excellent
sierra
nevada
i
suggest
you
invite
the
sasquatch
and
for
7
99sixer
you
cant
go
wrong
d
i
have
to
admit
this
is
my
first
barleywine
but
now
i
know
what
all
of
the
fuss
is
about
bigfoot
is
a
must
try
this
brew
demands
respectful
sips
and
the
high
abv
will
make
you
pay
if
you
dont
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
thick
this
is
without
a
doubt
a
sipping
beer
and
definately
not
for
the
novice
beer
drinker
it
may
be
one
that
a
beer
drinker
has
to
work
their
way
up
to
like
i
have
overall
a
great
example
of
the
style
especially
given
its
available
in
most
local
stores
served
up
in
sixpacks
pours
a
very
dark
amber
with
thick
foamy
white
head
and
ruby
highlights
when
light
passes
through
the
glass
smells
strongly
of
hops
floral
piney
and
with
some
candylike
sweetness
just
behind
it
the
flavor
follows
the
smell
in
that
the
hops
are
at
the
forefront
in
a
big
way
to
the
extent
even
of
an
ipa
on
the
first
few
sips
but
there
is
a
sweetness
behind
it
which
grows
as
the
beer
opens
up
a
bit
and
settles
towards
room
temperature
this
isnt
so
much
a
malty
sweetness
but
sugary
and
a
bit
fruity
its
very
complex
but
its
sort
of
a
journey
like
searching
for
a
sasquatch
in
that
you
have
to
search
for
it
a
bit
the
mouth
is
moderate
with
sort
of
a
full
body
and
prominent
crisp
carbonation
its
refreshing
though
it
almost
approaches
syruplike
quality
in
the
sweetness
this
brings
down
its
drinkability
a
bit
overall
its
great
but
its
very
big
in
a
lot
of
ways
the
floral
aspect
is
really
out
at
the
forefront
and
i
could
stand
the
hop
character
brought
down
a
pinch
but
it
becomes
much
more
complex
as
you
get
through
it
the
taste
is
also
less
hoppy
and
more
malty
the
08
has
less
citrus
flavors
as
well
great
barleywine
bigfoot
season
is
always
a
good
one
pours
a
wonderful
brown
color
with
red
tinges
good
foamy
head
smells
of
citrus
and
sugars
taste
is
indescribable
so
sweet
but
bitter
enough
to
balance
it
the
hops
are
citrusy
yet
the
malt
is
candylike
its
just
amazing
and
it
goes
down
oh
so
smooth
a
truly
wonderful
offering
from
sn
drinkability
i
would
enjoy
one
of
these
from
time
to
time
while
this
is
my
first
barleywine
the
hops
seem
to
dominate
the
beer
a
tid
bit
too
much
for
my
tastes
to
drink
consistently
i
like
it
definitely
a
good
value
good
work
from
sn
interested
to
see
what
some
age
does
to
this
d
honestly
i
think
its
a
bit
too
raw
when
fresh
albeit
not
undrinkably
so
sometime
last
year
i
had
a
2007
bigfoot
and
i
remember
it
being
a
bit
more
balanced
what
it
comes
down
to
though
is
that
i
have
a
problem
with
the
idea
of
a
beer
that
has
to
be
laid
down
before
its
any
good
why
not
just
make
a
beer
thats
good
fresh
or
alternatively
why
not
age
the
beer
before
you
release
it
overall
impression
probably
the
classic
american
barleywine
some
age
mellows
the
flavors
and
rounds
out
the
edges
a
bit
but
i
prefer
it
fresh
definitely
pick
up
at
least
one
six
pack
every
time
it
comes
out
d
the
first
and
best
barley
wine
i
ever
had
drink
and
enjoy
d
at
9
6
abv
one
is
the
perfect
amount
very
enjoyable
drinkability
is
appropriate
for
the
style
d
easy
enough
to
drink
that
i
could
consider
this
a
session
beer
albeit
a
somewhat
short
session
at
nearly
10
smooth
and
refreshing
i
must
say
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
barleywine
and
i
look
forward
to
my
next
six
pack
d
one
pint
over
a
few
hours
was
very
nice
a
six
pack
would
last
me
a
while
and
i
can
understand
why
many
cellar
the
cant
wait
to
see
my
vertical
build
d
having
sampled
previous
vintages
and
older
bottles
i
can
be
fairly
assured
that
all
my
qualms
with
this
batch
should
fade
as
it
matures
over
time
the
fact
that
the
beer
is
still
this
tempestuous
at
age
1
tells
me
itll
be
fine
to
hold
up
over
the
long
haul
indeed
i
always
look
forward
to
revisiting
this
beer
and
have
never
finished
the
glass
anything
but
satisfied
the
bigfoot
is
an
increadibly
complex
and
intriguing
ale
while
the
hop
aromas
are
very
nice
fresh
i
think
that
the
bitterness
is
a
little
too
raw
and
brash
it
is
alot
better
drinking
around
612
months
in
my
opinion
the
rest
of
the
sixer
will
be
resting
in
the
cellar
for
a
while
overall
an
interesting
beer
i
think
i
will
hold
on
to
the
others
and
see
how
it
ages
d
this
one
is
a
one
beer
type
for
me
the
high
abv
is
right
there
and
being
full
bodied
makes
it
very
filling
this
is
one
of
my
first
barleywine
beers
and
it
is
really
not
for
me
tonight
bigfoot
joins
celebration
as
one
of
my
favorite
sierra
nevada
beers
this
is
great
overall
i
strongly
recommend
this
but
its
not
something
that
i
think
i
could
endulge
in
often
i
poured
this
delicious
ale
from
bottle
to
pint
glass
slightly
chilled
in
fridge
for
only
1
12
hours
the
head
formed
nicely
just
above
three
fingers
and
slowly
settled
to
a
clear
rich
copperred
color
between
drinks
the
ale
left
strong
distinct
lacing
that
gave
a
good
history
of
my
drinks
it
had
a
strong
hop
aroma
that
carried
from
start
to
finish
with
a
very
sweet
bouquet
the
mouthfeel
was
great
with
a
balanced
amount
of
bitterness
for
the
aftertaste
i
savored
each
drink
but
i
do
recommend
drinking
this
one
slowly
this
was
a
very
tasty
ale
and
i
was
suprised
when
i
discovered
the
abv
was
upward
of
9
cheers
just
awesome
for
what
it
is
this
beer
is
dangerously
quaffable
the
alcohol
is
subtle
and
doesnt
slow
you
down
a
bit
and
the
freshness
makes
for
an
unbelievably
balanced
brew
drinkability
pretty
huge
apparently
i
dont
hate
barleywines
i
just
hate
old
horizontal
or
maybe
i
just
like
bigfoot
still
this
is
nowhere
near
my
favorite
style
but
at
least
i
know
i
can
enjoy
this
style
this
is
a
seductively
drinkable
suckerpunch
i
love
this
beer
perhaps
my
favorite
barley
wine
and
certainly
my
favorite
of
the
sierra
nevada
line
drinkability
do
you
like
to
get
kicked
in
the
face
with
flavor
i
do
drink
up
do
for
a
vintage
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
how
well
this
held
up
having
had
many
releases
of
bigfoot
however
i
was
disappointed
to
see
how
far
this
had
faded
im
not
sure
how
long
people
are
aging
their
barleywines
but
i
think
8
years
may
be
a
bit
too
long
for
this
one
if
you
want
to
get
the
robust
flavor
this
beer
is
known
for
4
0
while
the
beer
is
strong
its
also
full
of
flavor
easily
something
worth
having
but
something
to
sip
and
enjoy
ddecent
drinkability
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
but
quite
tasty
perhaps
a
little
less
complex
than
i
desired
drinkability
though
this
was
delicious
fresh
bigfoot
is
not
terribly
drinkable
prepare
yourself
for
a
punch
in
the
face
kick
in
the
pants
andor
twist
of
the
nipples
thick
bitter
and
strong
as
hell
i
will
be
ordering
this
again
d
hops
pack
quite
a
punch
here
so
much
that
one
or
two
might
be
enough
for
now
but
im
eager
to
set
some
aside
to
age
for
future
tasting
i
wish
i
had
a
real
beer
cellar
to
let
this
calm
down
a
bit
but
still
a
great
beer
deserving
of
its
cult
following
easily
drinkable
mouthfeel
was
a
tad
thin
and
watery
i
wanted
this
to
be
thicker
as
it
is
a
bigger
beer
decent
carbonation
present
taste
is
right
up
front
with
some
hop
bitterness
but
finishes
smooth
and
sweet
with
caramelly
goodness
slight
boozy
quality
to
it
but
that
is
expected
decent
barleywine
id
drink
it
again
and
i
plan
to
d
even
though
it
comes
in
at
9
6
bigfoot
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
overall
i
was
able
still
to
enjoy
it
hops
are
way
overdone
in
my
opinion
though
drinkability
is
low
due
to
the
harshness
and
acidity
you
can
actually
still
taste
hops
in
your
mouth
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
and
this
is
the
only
beer
ive
ever
had
that
gives
me
heinous
farts
and
an
unpleasant
morning
shit
after
only
one
bottle
im
going
to
cellar
a
few
bottles
and
see
what
happens
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
which
i
will
buy
again
bigfoot
yields
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
offwhite
head
that
leaves
lacing
a
sweet
aroma
of
toffee
spices
biscuits
and
brown
sugar
wow
taste
is
aggressive
spiced
bread
toffee
maple
notes
heavy
malt
and
then
the
missing
link
hits
when
youre
not
looking
flushed
by
alcoholic
booze
medium
bodied
in
mouthfeel
and
very
enjoyable
even
though
bigfoot
is
playing
soccer
with
my
head
i
dont
mind
too
much
a
highly
enjoyable
winter
warmer
as
well
as
a
great
summertime
night
cap
gorgeously
crisp
and
wonderfully
versatile
one
of
my
favorites
i
like
this
beer
but
i
think
i
will
hang
on
to
a
couple
to
age
and
see
if
it
gets
better
i
have
confidence
that
it
will
drinkability
a
great
evening
sipper
with
just
the
slightest
alcohol
bite
i
look
forward
to
seeing
this
beer
progress
over
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
drinkability
not
really
for
me
d
perhaps
sierra
nevada
was
prepping
this
for
long
cellaring
by
overhopping
and
overcarbonating
it
in
advance
its
still
drinkable
now
but
tastes
more
like
a
highhop
dipa
than
a
barleywine
not
that
drinkable
but
decent
i
loved
it
overall
a
good
barleywine
but
would
have
hope
for
something
better
since
that
i
heard
so
much
about
it
will
buy
again
but
not
on
my
priority
list
this
year
is
way
more
balanced
than
last
the
alcohol
is
hidden
way
better
than
the
last
batch
very
smooth
and
drinkable
be
careful
overall
drinkability
i
think
this
one
needs
to
rest
for
at
least
a
year
to
mellow
it
is
a
bit
harsh
in
the
end
i
love
the
upfront
hops
and
sugar
but
i
dont
care
for
the
harsh
charcoal
alcohol
finish
it
does
though
like
most
high
abv
brews
get
a
little
more
drinkable
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
probably
should
be
served
a
little
warmer
than
my
beer
fridge
setpoint
cant
wait
to
try
this
one
next
year
maybe
one
from
this
sleeve
a
year
is
in
order
drinkability
the
alcohol
becomes
more
prevalent
as
it
warms
and
the
overwhelming
nature
of
the
flavors
detract
some
from
overall
drinkability
as
a
whole
though
its
a
very
solid
brew
and
a
damn
bargain
at
11
for
a
sixer
d
this
beer
is
tricky
it
starts
out
so
hoppy
but
the
sweetness
just
completely
takes
over
making
this
beer
wonderful
for
dessert
next
time
ill
split
a
bottle
for
after
dinnermostly
because
of
the
immense
sweetness
that
pulls
through
id
love
to
know
what
this
beer
tastes
like
after
a
couple
of
years
get
it
while
you
can
pours
a
red
colored
body
noncloudy
with
a
small
white
head
diminishing
has
a
very
hoppy
sweet
bitter
sickly
piney
aroma
alcoholy
sweet
with
some
candy
taste
hops
some
pine
malty
drinkable
less
alcohol
as
it
warms
this
is
the
first
beer
that
i
have
been
addicted
to
in
a
literal
sense
the
only
solution
is
to
review
this
last
one
and
wait
until
next
year
the
best
barleywine
i
have
had
it
will
be
touch
to
surpass
this
sierra
nevada
has
made
a
really
great
beer
and
continues
to
impress
me
general
comments
possibly
the
best
smelling
beer
ive
come
across
with
a
taste
and
mouthfeel
to
nearly
match
the
abv
is
a
drawback
i
feel
since
it
is
so
powerful
it
cant
really
be
enjoyed
in
great
quantities
except
for
irish
or
italian
people
wait
im
irishitalian
pour
me
another
this
brew
would
be
best
enjoyed
alongside
a
sophisticated
meal
requiring
a
palatecleanser
possibly
duck
oysters
on
the
half
shell
or
perhaps
a
beef
wellington
food
pairings
aside
for
tobacco
aficionados
try
enjoy
with
your
fullest
flavor
cigar
or
a
very
strong
aromatic
pipe
tobacco
this
beer
is
an
excellent
palate
cleanser
given
a
choice
i
would
have
a
hard
time
choosing
between
this
brew
and
my
holiday
party
faithful
choice
of
chimay
d
very
tasty
and
extremely
hoppy
for
the
style
this
drinks
like
a
hybrid
between
a
barleywine
and
a
robust
double
ipa
a
real
sipper
given
the
relatively
unmasked
alcoholic
nature
review
is
for
the
2009
vintage
for
a
fairly
fresh
barley
wine
this
is
well
done
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
this
tastes
like
in
a
couple
of
months
or
a
year
or
two
buy
a
case
and
put
some
away
for
the
future
in
this
economy
it
could
be
your
best
investment
the
above
was
for
the
2009
bigfoot
imo
the
2010
is
much
better
bigger
hop
presence
nicely
bitter
massive
head
that
held
to
the
very
end
smooth
finish
for
such
a
big
beer
this
one
a
i
really
love
easily
a
solid
a
type
brew
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
i
think
its
a
bit
young
still
the
hops
are
at
a
dipa
bitterness
and
aroma
level
now
and
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
over
the
top
i
think
that
some
age
will
mellow
those
hops
and
soften
the
alcohol
a
bit
even
so
this
beer
will
be
good
at
any
stage
of
its
life
d
very
drinkable
i
could
have
the
a
few
more
times
curious
as
to
what
its
like
on
tap
or
aged
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
pretty
strong
carbonation
overall
a
very
nice
entry
point
for
me
into
the
world
of
barleywines
im
very
excited
to
cellar
and
experiment
with
these
over
time
like
rogues
barley
wine
this
beer
is
better
young
it
is
by
no
means
bad
but
i
find
the
fresher
beer
is
even
better
3

2008
version
very
little
aroma
most
likely
due
to
age
pours
very
dark
amber

a
two
finger
light
tan
head
lacings
are
plentiful
taste
is
sweet
roasted

a
very
full
earthy
hop
bitterness
a
hint
of
dark
cocoa
from
the

mouthfeel
is
very
nice
with
moderate
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
by
the
full
body
very
drinkable
for
the
style
will
probably
update
or
edit
this
review
when
i
try
the
2009
version
in
my
beer
fridge
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
for
any
fans
of
dipas
d
i
cant
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
just
too
unbalanced
and
boozy
to
make
this
a
regular
drinker
for
me
glad
i
tried
it
but
also
glad
i
didnt
buy
a
sixer
pours
a
dark
brownambery
with
a
foamy
offwhite

is
already
bitter
in
the
mouth
its
flavor
is
delightfulbarley
malt
and
alcohol
oh
and
then
a
pretty
good
hop
bite
overall
thick
and
flavorful
and
bitterdrinkable
but
slowly
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
barley
wines
but
it
was
a
pretty
fun
experience
d
a
nice
drink
that
ill
definitely
enjoy
each
year
but
not
one
ill
plan
on
really
stocking
up
onmaybe
one
to
grab
a
few
bottles
of
each
year
to
see
how
it
changes
my
kind
of
barleywine
very
glad
i
picked
this
guy
up
actually
did
a
vertical
of
19992008
on
2
mar
2008
but
lost
my
freakin
notes
drinkability
at
9
6
abv
this
is
very
sessionable
could
be
a
dangerous
one
if
you
have
too
many
in
a
sitting
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
i
love
how
sn
uses
their
hops
to
their
advantage
they
combined
2
great
styles
together
in
this
and
it
works
an
excellent
beer
overall
if
you
havent
tried
it
call
your
local
package
store
and
demand
it
a
very
good
brew
by
sn
as
good
as
it
is
i
think
for
me
a
12
ounce
bottle
is
more
than
enough
in
a
night
would
like
to
see
how
this
guy
tastes
in
a
year
after
the
hops
have
faded
drinks
well
for
a
barleywine
but
these
are
only
12oz
bottles
really
good
atmosphere
solid
appearance
and
really
distinctive
nose
flavor
is
not
complex
but
plenty
of
it
heavy
and
syrupy
body
as
youd
expect
from
this
style
and
hoppy
and
tinny
as
youd
expect
more
specifically
from
the
american
version
really
nice
to
savor
great
quaff
but
you
gotta
like
the
style
drinkability
or
as
it
should
be
called
for
this
beer
drunkability
i
was
taking
samples
of
other
beer
and
figured
i
would
only
do
a
half
pint
of
the
bigfoot
half
way
through
the
12
pint
i
was
pretty
drunk
so
be
careful
with
this
one
she
may
taste
smooth
as
hell
but
she
has
a
great
right
hook
its
about
time
someone
finally
reviewed
this
beer
only
1460
reviews
bigfoot
is
an
old
friend
and
i
finally
find
my
self
reviewing
him
2009
fresh
review
pours
a
nice
clean
dark
amber
with
a
thick
pillowy
head
that
puff
up
out
of
my
goblet
like
a
beer
marshmallow
smells
of
sticky
pine
hops
and
big
sweetness
laced
with
alcohol
flavor
is
big
and
bitter
but
also
big
and
flavorful
not
a
onenote
bitter
bomb
lots
of
moving
mixing
flavors
pine
grapefruit
caramel
demerera
sugar
ethanol
bitterness
and
hop
flavors
linger
and
linger
and
linger
big
and
sticky
and
great
i
love
this
beer
i
used
to
think
it
was
only
good
aged
but
no
its
a
true
marvel
when
fresh
as
well
im
rerating
this
because
i
tried
this
one
again
after
getting
into
more
hoppy
beers
latley
and
actually
this
is
growing
on
me
i
guess
i
have
gotten
accustomed
to
a
higher
hop
content
because
i
actually
enjoy
drinking
this
now
im
still
not
in
love
with
it
but
it
could
get
that
way
its
a
more
balanced
then
my
previous
palette
lead
me
to
believe
this
is
a
great
dessert
beer
i
will
be
reaching
for
this
one
again
and
am
still
interested
in
trying
to
age
some
of
these
to
see
how
they
turn
out
d
alcohol
isnt
overpowering
suffers
a
little
because
im
not
really
digging
the
flavor
d
alcohol
present
high
hops
and
malt
try
again
next
year
to
see
if
it
becomes
more
balanced
edit
after
a
couple
more
tries
this
beer
is
growing
on
me
i
feel
i
wasnt
ready
for
it
at
the
time
i
bought
it
and
first
tried
it
i
upped
my
review
as
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
and
i
am
beginning
to
like
this
hardly
a
drinkable
beer
overall
but
considering
its
size
and
hop
profile
it
is
surprisingly
mouthwatering
i
had
this
last
year
but
it
was
bought
around
june
maybe
the
extra
months
sitting
on
a
shelf
made
it
more
palatable
or
they
just
hop
bombed
it
this
year
d
damned
drinkable
for
as
bitterhoppy
as
it
is
the
alcohol
isnt
present
at
all
other
than
being
slightly
apparent
in
the
smell
and
a
mild
glow
in
the
belly
it
goes
down
smooth
and
tastes
even
better
as
it
warms
up
i
like
it
a
lot
drinkability
is
alright
although
i
seriously
would
choose
almost
any
sierra
nevada
over
this
overall
im
somewhat
dissapointed
despite
the
fact
its
still
a
decent
brew
from
the
sierra
nevada
name
this
is
a
2009
brew
and
ive
stashed
one
away
and
will
give
it
another
rip
in
a
year
on
tap
at
the
scuffer
in
burlington
i
was
able
to
enjoy
this
famous
beer
my
pint
was
delivered
to
me
a
deep
ruby
color
with
good
clarity
and
some
rising
carbonation
the
onefinger
head
was
beige
the
retention
good
and
the
lacing
consistent
the
aroma
was
notably
sweet
a
mix
of
caramel
malt
sweet
malt
toasted
malt
floral
hops
and
some
bitter
herbal
hops
the
flavors
were
delicious
i
tasted
caramel
malt
toffee
brown
sugar
and
some
notes
of
dark
fruit
balanced
by
bitter
hops
and
citrus
hops
in
general
i
thought
the
balance
was
excellent
and
the
sweetness
concealed
the
high
alcohol
percentage
very
well
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
full
and
the
carbonation
onpoint
for
the
style
a
great
american
barleywine
and
well
worth
tracking
down
its
big
feet
hopheads
rejoice
anyone
who
thinks
more
more
more
doesnt
equal
better
better
better
well
you
might
want
to
lay
off
this
one
or
lay
it
down
for
a
year
or
two
lemme
know
how
it
goes
as
i
wont
be
buying
any
more
of
this
drinkability
a
definite
sipper
excellent
barleywine
example
that
will
also
satisfy
hopheads
not
too
many
ales
you
can
say
that
about
dtoo
drinkable
i
could
have
three
pints
if
i
drank
it
fast
enough
i
wouldnt
want
to
though
that
would
get
me
drunk
which
is
not
a
good
thing
a
very
excellent
brew
quite
good
but
thank
god
for
my
perceived
pain
threshold
rj
fairly
transparent
amber
pour
white
bubbles
that
disappeared
fairly
quickly
a
lot
of
hop
pine
citrus
and
a
little
booze
in
the
aroma
surprisingly
large
amount
of
piney
citrus
hop
flavor
malt
is
secondary
quite
lively
mouthfeel
a
little
too
bitey
for
me
and
a
tad
bit
hot
finish
very
clean
ok
i
just
prefer
a
malt
inclined
barleywine
d
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
i
took
about
two
hours
with
12oz
a
bit
of
hotness
and
the
thick
appeal
makes
for
small
sips
only
one
bottle
a
night
for
me
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
will
try
in
a
year
or
so
d
with
an
abv
of
almost
ten
percent
you
only
going
to
be
able
to
properly
taste
two
or
three
of
these
babies
a
genuinely
unique
experience
for
me
as
my
first
barleywine
and
still
one
of
my
favorites
some
age
will
do
this
one
good
thank
you
sn
for
another
hoppy

of
why
i
love
american
beer
2009
vintage
served
in
my
new
new
belgium
goblet
courtesy
of
mauerhan
poured
a
translucent
but
slightly
hazy
mahogany
with
a
dense
half
inch
offwhite
head
bands
of
lacing
were
revealed
as
it
slowly
receded
the
glass
must
have
a
nucleation
point
etched
in
it
because
a
spiral
of
tiny
bubbles
gently
swirled
up
to
the
underside
of
the
cap
potent
nose
could
smell
it
from
eight
inches
away
aromas
suggest
hops
dark
fruit
and
maybe
some
toffee
or
caramel
in
the
mix
hops
hits
you
right
in
the
face
on
the
first
sip
before
revealing
the
characteristics
implied
by
the
nose
and
then
finishing
with
a
lingering
medicinal
bitterness
between
quaffs
mouthfeel
was
slightly
more
than
mediumbodied
with
a
mild
viscosity
and
a
subtle
but
consistent
background
effervescence
that
adds
a
liveliness
to
the
brew
also
detected
a
little
alcohol
heat
but
it
wasnt
clearly
revealed
in
the
flavor
profile
wasnt
sure
how
i
was
going
to
feel
about
this
brew
i
really
enjoyed
it
very
much
but
it
is
definitely
a
sipper
and
i
really
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
overall
this
is
a
great
barleywine
and
very
reasonable
for
a
6pack
i
tasted
the
2009
edition
its
definitely
more
hoppiness
than
im
used
to
in
my
barleywines
though
as
well
as
more
carbonation
excellent
overall
though
taste
is
a
little
of
the
caramel
and
an
earthy
flavor
good
body
to
this
one
and
one
to
seek
if
searching
for
a
barlywine
drinkability
fairly
drinkable
for
a
9

abv
beer
barleywines
are
not
my
favorite
category
of
beers
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
mediumfull
body
chevy
distinct
and
longlasting
warming
sensation
overall
quite
drinkable
but
very
very
intense
feels
quite
dangerous
very
nice
big
beer
from
sierra
nevada
my
favorite
from
them
to
date
d
very
good
overall
i
love
barleywines
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
its
got
everything
a
barleywine
should
have
and
then
some
if
you
havent
had
the
experience
of
bigfoot
i
highly
suggest
you
get
out
there
and
grab
it
because
as
we
all
know
bigfoot
is
quite
elusive
d
i
would
like
to
drink
100
of
these
unfortunately
i
would
die
but
what
a
way
to
go
amber
waves
of
grain
adorn
the
engaging
ruby
hued
brew
with
a
crown
of
tan
foam
sugar
cookie
caramel
bitter
lemon
and
grapefruit
with
intense
pine
oil
hop
profile
blankets
the
nose
the
taste
is
very
strong
of
malt
the
slips
into
a
lipsmacking
juicy
hoppiness
with
citrus
rind
and
a
medium
dry
feel
on
the
palate
when
it
warms
there
is
some
rum
fruit
cake
raisins
and
honey
in
the
aroma
after
a
few
sips
the
sticky
lace
clings
to
the
glass
beautifully
bigfoot
could
age
beautifully
for
25
years
but
why
wait
grab
it
now
and
save
a
couple
for
later
i
really
love
this
beer
would
definitely
enjoy
another
2
or
3
of
these
a
fine
beer
indeed
d
very
drinkable
sits
well
in
the
stomach
wow
cant
wait
to
try
some
of
the
other
barleywines
recommended
by
my
fellow
bas
overall
though
this
is
not
the
best
barley
wine
i
have
ever
had
it
is
a
great
one
great
complexity
and
good
flavor
dsure
you
bet
its
good
the
abv
is
pretty
well
hidden
and
even
when
noticed
seems
to
fit
perfectly
balanced
intense
grapefruit
hop
flavors
on
top
of
the
syrupy
malt
backbone
very
bitter
finish
is
this
a
dipa
or
a
barleywine
overall
its
a
great
tasting
well
balanced
particularly
smooth
and
excellent
smelling
beer
ill
be
picking
up
more
myself
and
highly
recommend
you
do
the
same
the
drinkability
is
huge
but
dangerous
it
hides
its
alcohol
too
well
other
than
that
it
is
a
standout

i
typically
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
sitting
but
this
was
surprisingly
very
drinkable
i
seem
to
have
gotten
so
lost
in
the
taste
to
even
notice
the
alcohol
so
i
definitely
felt
like
i
was
ready
for
another
afterwards
always
worth
grabbing
a
few
of
these
every
year
and
ill
be
interested
to
see
how
this
one
has
aged
by
next
year
pours
a
very
dark
amber
with
an
slightly
tanned
head
aroma
is
prominently
earthy
hops
complimented
by
brown
sugar
and
caramel
front
of
the
palate
is
molasses
and
dark

sugar
sweetness
alcohol
asserts
itself
as
well
it
an
inviting
warming
manner
floral
hops
reemerge
in
the
finish
with
a
lingering
bitterness
a
nicely
subdued
degree
of
carbonation
a
stickey
resiny
residual
mouthfeel
a
barleywine
of
course
is
intended
to
be
filled
with
alcohol
and
its
presence
is
well
known
here
but
not
overwhelmingly
a
nice
balance
of
dark
sweet
malt
hops
and
alcohol
maybe
a
touch
too
much
on
the
hops
for
the
style
whatever
that
means
but
for
a
hophead
like
myself
this
hits
the
spot
perhaps
this
beer
should
be
called
a
barleywine
style
ipa
very
nice
drinkability
felt
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
barleywine
i
might
have
to
try
this
again
with
some
age
on
it
fresh
however
it
tastes
like
most
of
sns
other
offerings
with
just
a
little
sweetness
in
the
background
not
bad
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
for
a
barleywine
for
a
smooth
preaged
experience
i
think
the
old
brooklyn
has
a
less
wild
taste
not
necessarily
as
true
to
the
style
but
more
drinkable
bottom
line
for
this
beer
is
this
i
want
another
and
i
dont
have
one
this
is
a
great
two
beer
limit
session
the
first
year
i
tried
was
the
2005
expedition
ive
tried
it
every
year
since
and
it
hasnt
been
for
me
until
this
year
this
beer
looks
smells
and
tastes
as
good
as
any
of
the
best
triple
ipas
out
there
i
am
truly
shocked
at
how
different
this
beer
is
form
all
the
prior
years
ive
tried
it
big
hops
are
all
over
this
baripaleywine
ive
been
cellaring
beers
as
of
2007
and
only
bought
the
whole
six
to
try
a
few
and
put
the
rest
down
here
we
are
on
day
two
and
im
on
the
last
one
overall
im
going
to
get
more
to
store
and
more
to
drink
now
if
your
a
hophead
your
going
to
want
to
drink
this
one
fresh
awesome
change
to
the
bigfoot
sn
a
nice
american
barleywine
but
maybe
not
my
favorite
i
like
them
to
be
really
hopcentric
and
this
one
is
more
on
the
balanced
side
i
love
a
good
barleywine
ale
but
this
one
needs
a
little
time
to
mature
before
it
becomes
the
bigfoot
i
know
and
enjoy
i
drank
this
bottle
as
an
appetizer
before
my
dinner
did
i
mention
that
this
beer
is
a
beast
weighing
in
at
just
above
150lb
i
had
to
pair
up
my
beer
with
some
cheese
in
order
to
finish
my
12oz
bottle
before
it
got
warm
d
delicious
but
then
again
im
a
hophead
ive
done
a
vertical
tasting
of
bigfoot
and
five
years
was
a
real
sweetspot
for
this
beer
its
much
sweeter
and
balanced
as
the
hops
die
off
however
as
i
said
im
a
hophead
and
this
beer
is
great
fresh
cant
wait
to
see
this
one
mature
though
drinkability
is
lacking
at
present
but
this
i
expect
to
improve
with
aging
as
well
i
had
wondered
whether
this
beer
was
overhyped
on
this
site
and
to
be
honest
even
hesitated
to
buy
a
12
sixpack
of
it
in
part
for
this
reason
happily
no
regrets
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
thick
off
white
sticky
heading
very
thick
looking
decent
lacing
rings
throughout
the
session
smell
is
ridiculous
with
hops
and
of
citrus
taste
is
very
piney
and
overwhelming
with
different
type
of
hops
that
just
attack
your
mouth
a
very
dry
aftertaste
and
the
alcohol
quickly
follows
a
very
sneaky
beer
indeed
as
you
can
not
taste
the
alcohol
to
the
very
end
this
is
the
first
time
trying
this
beer
and
i
must
say
very
impressive
hoppy
nice
honey
sweetness
very
bitter
aftertaste
very
sweet
foretaste
pours
a
decent
tan
head
color
is
a
nice
dark
red
burgendy
transparent
color
with
decent
lighter
carbination
scent
has
a
nice
piney
scent
to
it
taste
has
a
wonderful
bit
sweetness
to
it
and
a
little
bit
of
piney
flavor
to
it
followed
by
a
nice
hit
of
bitterness
aftertaste
to
it
god
my
taste
buds
are
going
nuts
mouthfeel
is
nice
not
too
thick
but
has
some
substinance
to
it
overall
a
great
beer
for
every
once
in
a
while
when
i
want
a
wonderful
full
bodied
beer
with
a
nice
load
of
hoppy
goodness
the
beer
was
presented
in
a
10oz
tulip
the
beer
produced
a
huge
off
white
head
which
left
some
serious
lacing
as
the
beer
receded
it
looked
like
someone
pained
rings
around
the
glass
thats
some
seriously
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
crazy
hops
wow
lots
of
citrus
overwhelms
the
olfactory
senses
but
beneath
that
frontal
assault
of
hops
is
a
really
mellow
sweetness
coming
from
what
has
to
be
an
absolute
ton
of
malt
since
it
was
able
to
sneak
out
from
under
the
hops
the
taste
is
equally
great
huge
hops
muddled
with
a
big
malty
backbone
this
is
what
ive
always
thought
a
barleywine
should
taste
like
or
at
least
i
always
wanted
it
to
taste
like
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
leaving
a
nice
oily
coating
holding
in
the
hop
goodness
the
beer
is
exceptional
plainly
put
this
beer
is
fantastic
as
a
fresh
beer
its
a
real
treat
for
hop
heads
that
dont
mind
a
little
alcohol
bite
overall
i
really
liked
the
fresh
version
but
i
was
even
more
impressed
with
the
aged
one
everyone
ages
this
for
a
reason
solid
poured
into
chalace
amber
with
a
off
white
one
finger
head
head
stays
around
for
a
long
time
with
excellent
lacing
smell
is
very
strong
has
fruit
hints
with
strong
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
taste
is
rather
light
considering
the
strong
smell
up
front
are
hints
of
roasted
malts
with
slight
chocolate
carmel
flavor
hop
bitterness
tickles
the
tongue
along
with
light
carbonation
alcohol
is
very
light
considering
the
abv
im
sure
this
will
mellow
out
well
with
age
i
plan
on
aging
a
few
of
this
six
pack
to
see
if
the
flavors
mellow
out
and
balance
themselves
somewhat
i
am
anxious
to
see
what
a
year
will
do
for
this
beer
d
this
is
a
really
tasty
barley
wine
with
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
hops
however
the
aged
2008
knocks
it
dead
in
comparison
i
think
ill
buy
a
sixer
of
these
to
lay
down
for
a
year
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
for
a
barlyine
probably
beccause
the
sweetness
is
kind
of
subdued
relative
to
others
leaving
a
brew
that
doesnt
cloy
drinkability
very
strong
so
not
something
you
should
be
sessioning
a
six
pack
of
but
personally
about
the
best
barley
wine
i
have
ever
had
for
that
i
gotta
give
it
good
marks
one
i
will
be
looking
for
yearly
as
it
is
released
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
barleywine
it
has
a
strong
alcohol
flavor
but
it
isnt
brutally
overpowering
like
other
barleywines
that
ive
tried
before
d
would
have
given
it
a
five
if
it
had
a
more
enjoyable
nose
i
had
to
search
to
find
most
of
the
things
mentioned
and
nose
has
everything
to
do
with
how
i
drink
the
beer
a
huge
beer
tons
of
top
aroma
and
flavor
that
is
relatively
balanced
by
the
enormous
sweet
bread
malt
backbone
the
quintessential
american
barleywine
cant
wait
to
see
how
the
flavors
develop
over
after
cellaring
conclusion
this
is
pretty
sharp
and
just
a
tad
unbalanced
with
the
aggressiveness
of
the
alcohol
and
the
hops
however
i
also
realize
that
this
was
just
released
some
time
in
the
bottle
ought
to
mellow
this
out
nicely
that
being
said
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
if
aggressively
hoppy
barleywine
notes
lots
of
ageing
potential
the
hops
will
fall
away
with
some
luck
and
that
will
balance
the
beer
out
between
bitter
and
sweet
over
the
next
year
or
two
after
that
i
suspect
the
malt
will
play
more
of
a
role
this
beer
might
live
for
10
years
or
so
given
proper
cellaring
drinkability
score
suffered
due
to
unbalance
in
hops
but
its
those
very
hops
that
will
allow
this
beer
to
age
for
a
long
time
so
a
tough
call
on
the
scoring
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
the
citrus
taste
reminiscent
of
grapefruit
or
sour
oranges
the
hops
also
provide
a
piney
and
slightly
sticky
taste
you
can
tell
the
malt
is
there
also
but
it
is
tough
to
pick
out
as
the
hops
are
some
dominant
the
finish
is
quite
bitter
and
the
heavy
hops
presence
brings
a
tingling
to
my
tongue
and
throat
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
provides
little
warming
in
the
finish
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
this
was
9
6
abv
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
heavy
with
a
syrupy
aspect
to
it
warming
from
the
alcohol
it
goes
down
smooth
but
it
also
has
a
serious
kick
to
it
great
sipper
as
the
alcohol
doesnt
overpower
top
notch
barleywine
drinkability
is
limited
to
one
at
least
for
me
this
is
an
intense
beer
drinkability
is
good
ultimately
balanced
although
the
hops
and
alcohol
challenge
the
palate
more
like
a
dipa
than
a
barleywine
even
after
aging
which
is
not
necessarily
bad
compared
the
2011
to
the
2010
and
it
definitely
benefits
from
a
year
of
aging
the
malt
comes
through
so
much
better
and
has
a
better
balance
with
the
hops
d
a
little
too
strong
to
be
sessionable
but
very
pleasant
at
this
stage
in
its
life
it
reminds
me
of
a
dipa
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
develops
over
time
check
this
one
out
this
beer
despite
its
highalcohol
is
remarkably
drinkable
unlike
any
other
barleywine
it
drinks
at
least
after
one
year
of
mellowing
like
a
strong
ipa
with
the
bitter
hoppiness
being
reserved
for
the
later
parts
of
the
palate
a
good
opposite
representation
is
presented
in
brooklyns
east
india
ipa
if
memory
serves
correctly
seems
to
be
surprisingly
allseasonable
drinking
this
in
front
of
a
woodstove
monitored
with
too
much
vigilance
has
left
me
with
a
distinct
annoyance
with
the
heat
and
this
beer
is
borderline
thirstquenching
probably
the
last
thing
any
barleywine
ever
could
say
it
was
where
this
beer
goes
from
here
is
anyones
guess
but
i
for
one
look
forward
to
seeing
first
sip
is
extremely
piney
but
it
finishes
with
citrus
particularly
the
grapefuit
flavor
ive
come
to
expect
from
sn
the
alcohol
definitely
makes
itself
known
leaving
my
mouth
tingling
drinkability
average
for
a
barleywine
i
suppose
m
mediumheavy
bodied
nice
oily
mouthfeel
dry
and
fruity
finish
to
hide
away
in
the
basement
poured
into
12oz
glass
poured
with
a
solid
medium
tan
head
lots
of
thick
sticky
lacing
a
gorgeous
mediumdeep
amber
color
a
nice
hop
presence
in
the
nose
but
not
as
strong
as
most
sn
brews
a
solid
malt
foundation
supports
those
hops
body
is
slightly
thin
for
a
barleywine
with
the
hops
having
the
usual
sn
boldness
this
is
very
drinkable
for
the
style
but
should
a
barleywine
be
an
easy
beer
to
drink
i
think
barleywines
should
be
maltier
not
as
hoppy
and
not
smoothly
drinkable
i
also
think
sn
overhops
all
the
beers
they
make
that
said
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
maybe
it
belongs
in
a
different
category
pours
a
clear
deep
copper
color
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
that
laces
most
of
the
glass
on
the
way
down
smells
of
grapefruit
pine
and
resin
if
i
squint
and
close
my
eyes
i
smell
a
tiny
bit
of
caramel
malt
deep
in
the
background
taste
initially
hits
with
the
hops
grapefruit
and
pine
eat
my
palette
there
is
a
malt
backbone
here
that
caramels
its
way
through
some
of
the
hops
before
being
beaten
down
by
the
bitterness
resinous
aftertaste
begs
for
another
sip
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
body
is
thick
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
and
resinous
carbonation
is
low
but
ample
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
barleywine
or
dipa
who
knows
i
dont
care
im
going
to
drink
this
every
year
ive
got
a
few
cellared
which
i
will
be
interested
to
try
over
the
next
year
or
so
to
see
how
they
improve
drinkability
funny
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
i
want
a
lot
more
of
it
the
high
abv
makes
you
wonder
how
many
you
could
drink
but
its
a
great
great
beer
being
slightly
intimidated
by
this
style
i
went
in
with
a
closed
mind
that
it
was
going
to
be
boozy
and
needed
to
age
in
order
to
lose
the
bite
i
was
wrong
its
so
drinkable
and
the
hops
taste
fresher
than
ever
i
can
see
where
cellaring
would
help
dissapate
the
hops
and
the
alcohol
bite
a
definate
try
if
you
hvent
had
any
or
little
experience
with
barleywines
incredible
brew
buy
a
case
every
year
this
one
looks
great
huge
fluffy
offwhite
head
dark
brown
in
color
its
not
your
typical
english
style
barley
wine
though
much
rougher
in
nature
much
more
emphasis
on
hops
rather
than
malt
and
yeast
massive
dry
hop
aroma
and
a
small
amount
of
flowery
hop
notes
the
taste
is
also
heavy
in
hop
bitterness
it
does
boast
a
good
amount
of
rich
sweet
maltiness
raw
brutal
and
so
damn
satisfying
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
brews
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
and
im
going
to
struggle
storing
some
of
it
to
drink
at
a
later
date
im
hoping
the
hops
will
fade
back
a
little
as
time
passes
and
let
the
malt
show
up
more
hope
to
be
able
to
improve
this
review
with
an
aged
bottle
in
a
year
or
so
mfd
oily
sticky
and
wonderful
to
drink
sip
medium
bodied
but
with
a
thick
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
although
it
is
a
definite
sipper
this
ale
went
down
exceptionally
well
i
would
love
one
with
a
nice
cigar
an
excellent
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
bitterness
from
the
alcohol
this
really
is
just
one
of
the
best
beers
out
there
right
now
and
at
a
heavy
9
6
it
warms
you
up
for
the
cold
winter
great
surprise
from
this
barelywine
ale
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
bigfoot
after
hearing
about
it
for
a
while
no
good
excuse
on
why
it
took
me
this
long
for
the
price
8
99
for
a
sixer
and
the
flavor
its
an
excellent
deal
and
another
great
beer
from
sierra
overall
one
day
this
will
be
a
fantastic
barleywine
even
after
letting
this
one
sit
for
a
year
the
hop
oils
still
have
not
been
infused
with
the
rest
of
the
ingredients
in
this
brew
given
at
least
another
year
this
will
be
a
malty
sugary
and
sweet
barleywine
that
should
be
reckoned
with
bottom
line
after
one
year
this
one
is
still
hot
with
plenty
of
hops
to
go
around
give
it
another
year
2
years
overall
at
the
minimum
before
opening
this
one
overall
impression
this
is
a
wonderful
sipper
of
a
beer
it
is
amazingly
complex
while
not
being
overbearing
in
any
way
it
has
the
perfect
level
of
aroma
flavor
and
alcohol
to
make
it
the
perfect
sippable
beer
for
a
cold
evening
for
the
price
point
it
is
unmatched
in
my
opinion
by
any
barley
wine
ive
had
if
youre
a
barley
wine
or
big
beer
fan
this
is
a
must
get
before
the
winter
is
over
this
beer
truly
sips
like
a
fine
spirit
drinkability
was
up
there
for
a
strong
beer
i
definitely
wasnt
sick
of
it
after
having
a
full
one
this
bad
boy
is
hoppeee
it
left
me
totally
reeling
in
a
great
way
i
wil
be
stocking
up
on
this
for
sure
do
not
miss
out
on
this
i
like
the
dry
finish
and
the
aftertaste
only
lingers
the
senses
filled
with
the
full
bodied
taste
very
drinkable
for
the
style
ill
try
to
age
some
or
a
few
maybe
one
moderate
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
make
it
drinkable
for
a
9
6
abv
beer
a
very
hoppy
barelywine
that
lives
up
to
the
hype
tastes
like
celebration
ale
on
crack
sierra
nevada
you
continue
to
impress
me
excellent
so
glad
to
be
trying
this
again
i
remember
trying
this
about
two
years
ago
and
i
hated
it
i
was
really
into
belgians
back
then
and
hadnt
really
tried
any
hoppy
beers
i
think
things
will
be
different
this
time
around
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
smells
nice
lots
of
piney
hops
with
sweet
caramel
malts
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
lots
of
piney
bittering
hoppiness
and
sweet
sweet
malty
goodness
alcohol
is
quite
noticeable
but
man
my
tastbuds
have
definitely
matured
this
beer
is
awesome
im
diving
headfirst
into
the
world
of
american
barleywines
04
is
the
grand
canyon
worn
to
a
majesty
not
surpassed
05
is
yellowstone
high
peaks
serene
beauty
rough
edges
look
like
they
belong
09
is
a
volcano
in
eruption
violent
awesome
and
downright
scary
drinkability
one
or
two
is
plenty
drink
slow
and
enjoy
d
i
couldnt
finish
my
pint
the
grapefruitloop
flavor
was
unbearable
it
was
so
bad
that
at
first
i
thought
it
had
to
be
the
cold
tap
temperature
but
it
improved
only
slightly
once
it
reached
cellar
and
then
room
temperature
notes
definitely
the
most
hopforward
barleywine
ive
had
to
date
superb
west
coast
hop
bill
that
rivals
dipas
with
some
sweet
malts
and
caramel
in
the
background
to
complement
i
am
officially
blown
away
by
this
superb
offering
from
sierra
nevada
highly
recommended
for
me
this
is
way
over
hoppy
right
now
i
cant
wait
to
taste
it
in
two
to
three
years
though
theres
a
reason
year
after
year
this
is
such
a
solid
brew
i
personally
really
enjoy
this
years
fresh
the
hop
notes
seem
really
well
refined
and
balanced
i
can
only
imagine
how
well
this
one
will
age
definitely
grab
a
few
while
you
can
excellent
foot
this
year
without
a
doubt
my
favorite
sn
beer
d
nice
to
drink
overall
the
2008
is
better
right
now
than
the
2009
if
you
didnt
get
that
from
the
reviews
however
the
2009
definitely
has
promise
for
aging
they
are
both
excellent
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
overall
impression
the
mouth
feel
is
luxurious
the
sharp
bitterness
detracts
for
malty
goodness
as
the
beer
warms
the
maltiness
comes
through
this
beer
should
be
drank
warn
d
been
having
more
barelywines
lately
so
far
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
those
ive
had
recently
could
enjoy
a
couplewhich
is
something
i
cant
say
for
a
lot
of
beers
of
the
style
this
is
only
the
second
barleywine
ive
ever
had
the
first
being
the
horn
dog
i
find
this
to
be
a
much
more
polished
brew
very
crisp
refreshing
decently
complex
wonderful
value
as
well
seems
pretty
hard
to
beat
in
terms
of
that
alone
d
on
the
whole
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
i
wont
say
its
my
favorite
of
barleywines
though
it
is
a
solid
beer
i
reserve
the
right
to
edit
in
the
future
i
am
very
new
to
the
style
and
have
little
to
compare
this
beer
to
i
like
the
big
flavors
and
yes
i
can
see
how
this
might
mellow
out
over
time
looking
forward
to
getting
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
barleywines
ive
had
this
beer
before
but
this
is
a
new
review
pours
a
very
lovely
dark
amberred
color
with
an
inchhigh
head
that
falls
quickly
leaving
behind
very
light
lacing
in
the
snifter
big
piney
hop
aroma
backed
up
by
some
thick
dark
caramel
maltiness
and
light
licorice
flavor
follows
suit
intense
hop
bitterness
overpower
the
dark
bready
caramel
malts
lots
of
dark
rum
soaked
fruit
with
pine
sap
drizzled
over
top
this
is
one
big
beer
alcohol
can
be
detected
throughout
from
nose
to
throat
but
its
all
a
part
of
this
beer
drinking
experience
its
damn
tasty
but
i
dont
want
more
than
one
at
a
time
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
and
probably
the
standard
for
american
barleywines
i
will
drink
two
of
these
and
age
the
rest
in
hopes
of
one
day
doing
a
10
year
vertical
very
good
fresh
but
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
one
aged
great
hoppy
american
barleywine
an
all
time
favorite
you
can
look
forward
to
each
year
ruby
orange
with
an
offwhite
soft
head
really
beautiful
good
resiny
hop
aroma
smells
like
hop
juice
same
in
the
flavor
but
better
deliciously
sweet
malt
finish
a
bit
fizzy
with
a
medium
to
full
body
great
to
sip
or
to
take
some
healthy
swigs
of
d
very
nice
was
pleasantly
surprised
however
i
cant
imagine
drinking
more
than
one

sitting

poured
into
snifter
color
is
deep
copper
colored
brown
with
little
head
delightful
aroma
of
hops
and
a
little
sweetness
buried
underneath
the
hopiness
taste
of
sweeter
hops
and
a
little
tartness
after
the
initial
hop
character
mouth
feel
is
a
little
thick
that
as
weird
as
it
sounds
that
goes
away
fairly
fast
off
of
the
palate
a
little
malty
very
little
in
the
after
taste
along
with
the
hops
this
beer
is
the
definition
of
an
american
barleywine
in
my
opinion
highly
recommended
by
this
guy
to
any
barleywine
fan
or
someone
wanting
to
get
into
them
cheers
pours
a
dark

inch

a
half

thats
more
of
a
pale
yellow
than
an
offwhite
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
strongly
of
hops
of
course
its
a
sierra
nevada
i
can
pick
up
a
slight
fruitiness
as
well
as
some
distinguished
sweetness
im
not
really
picking
up
any
malt
characteristics
at
least
in
the
aroma
as
far
as
ive
read
this
fits
the
styleof
an
american
barleywine
so
far
this
beer
is
wetting
my
palate
and
im
really
hoping
not
to
be
let
down
mouth
feel
is
really
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
associated
dryness
of
higher
alcohol
content
theres
a
low
carbonation
level
the
first
taste
is
the
alcohol
then
the
hops
hits
and
then
some
tartness
is
present
in
the
aftertaste
along
with
a
little
sweetness
wow
this
is
like
no
other
beer
ive
had
but
im
really
liking
it
the
aftertaste
is
quite
strong
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
but
i
definitely
would
not
be
able
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
wow
heavy
bodied
medium
carbonation
a
thick
creamy
beer
that
coats
your
mouth
with
a
delicious
slick
of
yumminess
i
think
this
will
really
benefit
with
age
though
as
the
hop
profile
really
is
a
bit
much
in
its
present
state
not
that
i
dont
love
hops
but
i
also
love
a
well
balanced
barleywine
a
thick
frothy
head
which
clings
to
the
side
of
the
glass
as
it
drops

the
foam
is
fairly
resilient
only
dying
down
after
a
couple
of
minutes
and
leaving
a
light
coating
and
some
brilliant

smells
more
akin
to
an
ipa
than
a
barleywine
floral
cascade
hops
dominate
giving
it
that
signature
sn
bouquet
as
it
warms
sweet
malt
with
hints
of
molasses
and
raisins
peaks
through
sharply
hoppy
upon
first
tasting
with
quite
a
bit
of
grapefruit
coming
through
sweet
boozy
malt

faintly
evident
after
the
palate
gets
acclimatized
bitter
warming
finish
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
though
verging
on
syrupy
not
terribly
drinkable
at
least
for
me
the
hops
are
overpowering
and
the
alcohol
is
pretty
noticeable
with
a
couple
of
years
on
it
to
dull
the
hops
and
tone
down
the
alcohol
this
could
be
great
i
picked
up
an
individual
bottle
today
and
decided
to
try
it
before
purchasing
an
entire
six
pack
it
poured
an
amber
color
with
a
large
head
and
decent
lacing
the
smell
of
piney
hops
hit
me
real
quick
but
i
could
later
detect
some
spices
and
malts
quite
a
complex
smell
but
unbalanced
toward
the
hops
despite
the
aroma
i
was
still
a
bit
surprised
on
my
first
sip
it
seemed
to
taste
more
like
an
ipa
rather
than
a
barleywine
as
the
beer
was
more
bitter
than
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
not
that
its
a
bad
thing
once
my
palate
was
used
to
the
hops
shock
i
was
able
to
taste
much
more
of
the
beer
the
beer
is
initially
chocolaty
and
malty
and
the
hops
slowly
take
over
the
taste
there
is
a
warming
feeling
as
you
drink
this
beer
that
gives
me
the
sense
that
im
drinking
whiskey
however
i
cannot
taste
any
alcohol
in
the
taste
the
beer
is
carbonated
nicely
and
appears
to
be
near
the
perfect
thickness
this
beer
is
also
very
drinkable
but
i
prefer
to
have
no
more
than
one
at
a
time
it
just
seems
you
are
missing
out
on
the
beer
if
you
follow
up
with
multiples
overall
a
decent
barleywine
and
im
glad
i
got
my
hands
on
this
beer
notes
really
hoppy
spicy
tasty
beer
d
highly
drinkable
have
to
be
careful
at
9
6
d
its
a
10
abv
barleywine
youre
probably
not
going
to
put
a
few
of
these
down
its
very
filling
but
it
just
tastes
amazing
without
a
doubt
its
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
serving
type
bottle
opened
with
a
small
pfsst
poured
a
dark
copper
with
a
small
but
lasting
head
and
seems
to
still
have
nice
carbonation
lacing
is
very
thick
and
sticky
aroma
is
nice
fermented
fruits
plum
medicinal
notes
caramel
malt
flavor
still
has
a
nice
hop
sharpness
to
it
along
with
rich
boozy
fruits
oak
hints
caramel
malt
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
quite
bitter
and
absolutely
divine
i
cannot
really
find
any
hints
of
oxidation
at
all
this
is
drinking
damn
near
perfect
right
now
i
am
almost
speechless
im
glad
i
have
another
bottle
of
this
d
this
stuff
will
put
hair
on
your
chest
one
is
enough
for
me
d
high
but
the
booze
really
warms
you
up
fast
great
beer
i
got
a
2007
vintage
from
kadonny
as
well
i
cant
wait
to
try
d
this
was
an
awesome
beer
i
enjoyed
it
on
a
cold
night
watching
a
movie
and
it
was
perfect
will
be
picking
up
some
more
before
they
are
all
gone
the
brew
is
very
drinkable
for
the
style
but
the
alcoholic
content
means
that
even
if
i
did
have
more
than
one
bottle
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
two
or
three
in
a
night
if
they
2009
version
is
easier
to
drink
i
will
be
very
pleased
with
this
beer
overall
great
for
spring
great
for
winter
a
year
later
im
really
looking
forward
to
next
year
drinkability
as
barleywines
go
i
was
a
virgin
and
didnt
know
what
to
expect
i
can
see
this
as
a
sipper
on
a
cool
fall
evening
but
its
not
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
a
brew
i
will
keep
my
mind
open
on
the
barleywine
and
for
drinkability
i
will
turn
to
the
masses
i
do
know
that
everything
mellows
out
and
is
quite
enjoyable
at
50
or
so

is
largely
caramel

with

fruits
a
touch
of
floral
hops
in
the

heavy
palate
but
drinkable
d
this
is
not
the
kind
of
beer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
finishing
the
bottle
to
myself
would
have
been
difficult
to
be
honest
a
long
time
favourite
of
mine
now
i
can
attest
to
its
ability
to
continue
to
be
a
solid
beer
a
great
barley
wine
i
am
happy
it
was
2
years
old
but
i
think
it
would
be
even
better
if
it
was
a
little
older
this
was
my
first
venture
into
a
barleywine
style
and
i
have
to
say
im
not
a
fan
based
on
this
first
encounter
it
poured
a
nice
golden
brownorange
color
with
a
modest
head
smelled
very
piney
and
citrusy
i
didnt
care
for
the
taste
it
seemed
overly
bitter
but
that
may
be
the
style
and
i
havent
acquired
the
taste
for
it
yet
it
also
seemed
oily
with
not
a
ton
of
malt
to
it
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
another
in
the
same
sitting
but
i
am
looking
to
try
the
style
to
see
if
it
was
just
this
particular
sn
or
if
it
is
my
lack
of
appreciation
for
the
style
d
this
is
a
big
beer
in
everyway
big
on
hops
not
one
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
but
considering
the
abv
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
d
although
this
is
not
the
best
barleywine
i
have
had
it
is
pretty
good
people
say
this
cellars
like
a
champ
i
can
see
the
possibility
i
think
i
may
pick
up
a
handful
of
these
and
let
them
site
were
talking
at
least
3
years
though
maybe
ill
get
12
and
try
them
every
2
years
for
the
next
2
it
wont
be
tough
to
keep
my
hands
off
them
carbonation
is
contained
but
not
to
the
extent
where
this
becomes
a
listless
syrupy
mess
like
so
many
others
the
finish
is
understandably
resiny
given
all
the
hops
id
almost
like
to
dock
it
points
due
its
deviation
from
the
traditional
english
barleywine
but
i
guess
this
is
the
one
that
established
the
american
style
as
a
separate
category
worth
the
wait

nothing

will
definitely
try
again

if
you
dont

otherwise
im
good
for
a
few
points
before
getting
sleepy
i
believe
i
prefer
the
bottled
version
but
would
never
say
no
to
this
hairy
beast
this
beer
has
been
in
my
cellar
for
at
least
10
months
i
am
comparing
it
directly
to
a
stone
old
guardian
it
is
darker
but
fairly
clear
and
a
nice
whisky
colored
ruby
brown
the
smell
is
great
with
a
sweet
hoppy
scent
stronger
on
the
hops
the
taste
is
good
but
definiteyly
hop
intense
i
thought
that
would
relax
after
months
but
it
is
still
the
initial
flavor
that
hits
you
the
after
taste
is
good
becuase
the
hops
finally
starts
to
drop
and
you
get
the
smooth
sweetness
of
the
barley
to
shine
through
the
beer
isnt
entirely
that
drinkable
it
is
too
hoppy
i
like
a
hoppy
beer
but
given
the
intense
hops
and
the
high
alcohol
i
cant
handle
more
than
one
this
was
a
2007
version
aged
for
a
year
and
then
given
to
me
in
a
trade
the
color
is
an
orangebrown
cloudy
with
a
quarterinch
of
tan
head
smells
of
caramel
figs
malt
tastes
of
all
those
plus
some
berries
i
cant
quite
place
some
xmas
candytype
flavors
a
trace
of
hops
grapes
maybe
some
apple
and
pear
too
lots
of
flavor
going
on
not
real
intense
but
complex
and
enjoyable
carbonation
was
just
right
not
a
beer
you
can
drink
quicklythis
took
me
an
hour
to
sip
my
way
through
it
but
a
damn
fine
beer
to
be
sure
this
is
a
great
beer
i
especially
like
the
hop
contribution
to
the
style
d
perhaps
the
best
beer
from
sierra
nevada
overall
a
widely
available
and
very
good
example
of
the
barleywine
style
cheers
this
is
my
first
barleywine
so
i
really
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
but
let
me
tell
you
ill
be
trying
a
whole
lot
more
after
having
this
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
nice
head
that
dissapated
quickly
leaving
some
lacing
has
very
strong
smell
of
hops
some
malt
and
citrus
in
the
backround
tastes
very
strong
but
alcohol
is
hidden
by
the
bitterness
balanced
with
malt
and
hops
nice
and
thick
in
the
mouth
with
good
carbonatin
excellent
beer
but
dont
have
more
than
1
or
2
givin
the
strong
alcohal
content
drinkability
phew
im
not
even
halfway
through
and
i
can
already
feel
my
cheeks
getting
red
and
my
body
relaxing
i
definitely
couldnt
do
more
than
one
of
these
every
once
in
a
while
the
stickiness
and
uberpresent
alcohol
would
keep
me
from
coming
back
to
this
one
too
often
d
enjoyable
my
first
barleywine
so
i
dont
have
too
much
to
say
about
the
drinkability
i
have
4
more
of
these
left
in
the
pack
and
am
sure
me
and
my
roomie
will
enjoy
them

they
once
were

ill
certainly
have
to
cellar

d
could

drink

allston
on
saturday
night
to
catch
some
college
football
and
to
grab
some
food
and
beers
after
dinner
i
saw
one
of
their
specials
was
bigfoot
draft
for
5
99
came
served
in
a
tulip
glass
thin
head
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
dark
caramel
color
smell
was
a
bit
piney
taste
was
a
bit
sweeter
than
some
of
the
barleywines
ive
had
recently
got
a
lot
a
notes
of
seeded
fruits
like
fig
in
the
flavor
this
sweetness
seemed
to
help
with
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
though
you
could
definitely
tell
this
beer
was
high
in
alcohol
content
i
found
it
surprising
easy
to
drink
after
a
long
time
away
from
bigfoot
while
i
tried
other
barleywines
it
was
nice
to
come
back
to
one
of
the
founding
fathers
of
the
style
and
enjoy
it
it
took
me
2
hours
to
drink
this
and
it
actually
got
better
as
it
got
warmer
im
not
sure
i
like
big
foot
but
i
respect
it
rerate
had
a
2001
thanks
to
eric
all
of
the
things
i
didnt
like
about
this
beer
such
as
the
burn
have
dissapated
so
smooth
after
7
years
a
ton
of
citrus
and
bitter
hops
only
a
hint
of
warmth
my
rating
before
was
off
for
sure
a
good
beer
i
must
say
good
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
brownmaroon
taste
is
not
too
strong
its
pleasant
and
very
tasty
lots
of
barley
and
hops
nice
carbonation
i
dont
think
id
drink
more
than
one
in
one
sitting
but
its
hard
to
tell
as
ive
had
a
ton
to
drink
tonight
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
i
like
the
stone
barleywine
more
but
thats
stone
if
there
was
more
of
this
at
the
store
id
buy
more
overall
a
superior
ale
simply
excellent
overall
well
quality
beer
but
it
lacks
balance

at

abv
not
to
shabby
a
brew
however
me
not
appreciating
the
hop
nose
and
lightly
fruity
mouthfeel
this
is
an
extremely
hoppy
barleywine
it
takes
a
special
nose
and
gullet
to
appreciate
this
fine
brew
and
i
cant
say
i
did
notes
i
respect
that
barleywine
is
supposed
to
be
bitter
hoppy
but
i
just
dont
like
that
taste
in
beer
it
is
too
bitter
this
was
a
top
notch
barleywine
very
hoppy
tastes
almost
like
a
double
ipa
to
me
definitely
a
sipper
as
theres
some
alcohol
kick
but
definitely
not
as
harsh
as
brooklyns
monster
ale
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
and
will
be
trying
it
again
the
future
d
really
enjoy
this
brew
though
a
high
abv
i
could
certainly
sip
a
few
of
these
throughout
an
evening
a
tad
alcoholic
as
it
warms
up
good
beer
for
the
winter
this
beer
was
given
to
me
back
in
june
and
had
been
lost
in
the
back
of
the
fridge
since
it
may
have
gone
skunky
in
that
time
so
im
thinking
of
getting
another
one
to
rereview
it
at
another
time

simply
a
very
enjoyable
barleywine
definitely
fullbodied
and
smooth
if
not
a
little
dry
obviously
not
a
session
beer
but
overall
very
drinkable
the
bog
foot

is
a
crystal
clear
deep
tawny
and
mahogany
color
with
an
absolutely
incredible
dense
thick
head
that
leaves
a
ton
of
lace
and
has
good
retention
the
aroma
is
intesely
of
malted
barley
and
brown
sugar
the
hops
add
a
nice
complex
citrus
and
pine
quality
the
taste
follows
the
smell
but
increases
the
characteristics
this
beer
has
one
of
the
most
complete
experiences
in
terms
of
showing
you
around
its
qualities
fullbodied
and
wonderful
d
this
is
a
really
good
brew
it
needs
some
time
to
round
the
edges
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
i
am
down
with
this
brew
need
to
pick
up
soem
more
for
the
cellar
and
some
age
initially
sampled
in
2005
2008
version
pours
a
deep
brownamber
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
does
settle
down
to
patches
real
nice
hop
aroma
with
a
fruity
candy
presence
strong
hoppy
flavor
tangy
sour
fruits
with
caramel
malts
very
rich
and
full
and
the
flavors
balance
well
bitter
and
slightly
dry
finish
and
bitter
hops
tingle
on
the
tongue
long
after
the
sip
good
stuff
strong
hops
but
the
2005
version
i
had
before
was
a
touch
stronger
hop
flavor
nonetheless
this
is
an
amazing
beer
d
not
the
most
sessionable
beer
in
the
world
but
for
a
barleywine
it
rates
pretty
high
with
me
taste
is
similar
lots
of
hop
flavor
up
front
with
a
huge
sweet
malty
backbone
i
have
had
a
number
of
these
in
the
past
and
they
have
all
been
good
would
love
to
do
a
vertical
with
them
great
beer
drinkability
was
a
bit
low
and
could
see
this
ageing
longer
to
mellow
out
the
hop
profile
tasty
none
the
less
very
drinkable
and
is
also
a
very
nicely
priced
barley
wine
wish
they
brewed
this
year
round
good
job
here
d
maybe
one
or
two
not
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
entirely
too
hoppy
the
hops
dominate
every
other
flavor
3
0
the
hops
are
almost
a
bit
overwhelming
after
the
first
sip
it
becomes
difficult
to
pick
out
other
flavors
associated
with
the
malts
because
the
hops
have
such
a
strong
lingering
presence
not
that
thats
a
bad
thing
but
it
definitely
makes
this
a
very
distinctive
barleywine
i
cant
wait
to
drink
some
of
the
older
vintages
that
i
have
i
am
curious
to
see
how
long
this
beer
could
age
or
if
it
even
changes
over
time
this
beer
is
a
text
book
example
of
west
coast
brewing
this
has
its
flaws
but
remains
drinkable
and
presents
a
new
face
of
bigfoot
not
the
best
vintage
ive
had
but
still
good
poured
a
deep
and
hazy
ruby
red
chunky
with
light
visible
carbonation
head
is
rather
big
nose
is
alcohol
caramel
and
sugar
maybe
some
toffee
and
dried
fruit
plenty
of
bitter
hops
flavor
is
fullbodied
and
hoppier
than
expected
and
more
bitter
than
i
expected
somewhat
obnoxious
on
the
taste
as
it
warms
the
finish
takes
on
some
licorice
flavors
mouthfeel
is
thick
bitter
off
balance
tingly
with
alcohol
and
warming
that
bitterness
leaves
it
off
balance
to
me
this
thing
need
some
age
to
mellow
out
and
kill
that
hop
bitterness
i
know
that
american
bwines
are
hopped
to
hell
but
sometimes
you
have
to
find
common
ground
to
bitter
and
unpleasant
to
drink
i
like
sn
but
not
giving
it
an
a
just
because
of
the
name
or
label
sorry
average
bwine
at
best
d
very
drinkable
a
well
balanced
barleywine
though
it
may
lean
a
bit
more
towards
the
bitter
side
great
on
a
cold
night
have
to
be
careful
about
having
too
many
of
these
pours
an
amberbrown
with
a
nice
floppy
tan
head
as
the
head
recedes
there
is
lots
of
sticky
lacing
left
clinging
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
earthy
malts
dried
fruits
and
piny
hops
upfront
you
can
taste
the
earthness
of
the
malts
and
barley
dried
fruit
as
in
plums
and
raisins
the
hops
definitely
mellowed
with
age
but
still
gives
you
that
grassypiney
bitterness
that
lingers
the
aftertaste
of
malts
stays
with
you
until
your
next
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
thick
with
a
bitterness
that
tingles
about
your
mouth
and
tounge
this
is
a
sipper
and
a
homerun
im
glad
i
have
almost
a
case
of
the
bigfoot
left
in
my
cellar
d
this
is
a
sipper
drunk
too
fast
the
bitterness
builds
to
unpleasant
degrees
the
high
alcoholobviously
appropriate
for
styleblends
with
the
bitterness
to
make
this
one
that
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
in
a
sittingbut
not
because
its
not
tasty
what
a
great
beer
the
2008
25th
year
expedition
version
this
awesome
beer
pours
a
beautiful
red
in
my
pint
glass
it
is
meant
to
be
savored
like
a
good
cognac
but
i
cant
it
is
too
good
i
took
a
trip
to
the
central
coast
of
ca
and
i
brought
two
12
oz
bottles
home
the
one
bar
in
slo
that
serves
bigfoot
the
frog
and
peach
they
limit
you
to
only
one
serving
because
of
the
high
alcohol
content
you
really
dont
need
more
then
one
i
love
this
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
a
keg
for
home
bevmore
please
carry
this
beer
there
is
a
serious
whiskey
burn
on
the
way
down
and
its
very
thick
typical
barleywine
feel
very
strong
and
pumped
full
of
flavor
the
citrus
and
alcohol
battle
it
out
to
a
draw
one
is
plenty
drinkability
is
fairly
high
great
flavors
make
for
easy
consumption
height
of
alcohol
limnits
a
little
its
great
on
the
palate
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
i
really
think
that
it
feels
full
on
the
tongue
and
isnt
a
beer
to
be
sessioned
i
couldnt
think
of
many
beers
i
rather
sip
by
the
fire
on
a
winter
day
or
have
with
a
nice
dinner
d
low
this
stuff
is
thick
syrupy
bitter
sweet
etc
it
is
very
good
to
sip
and
enjoy
but
definitely
at
the
beginning
or
end
of
a
night
not
a
session
brew
but
delicious
nonetheless

whos
kidding
im
drunk
and
i
had
this
more
than
an
hour
ago
but
here
goes
it
had
a
chewy
mouthfeel
quite
caramelly
but
matched
by
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
this
stuff
was
out
of
season
and
not
aged
2008
guy
next
to
me
said
it
was
good
to
age
it
so
that
the
maltiness
could
come
through
i
could
see
that
because
there
was
a
thick
mouthfeel
provided
by
the
dark
malts
and
the
oiliness
of
the
hops
its
basically
just
an
upper
of
everything
both
malts
and
hops
but
couldnt
detect
the
alcohol
but
dont
let
it
scare
you
my
first
barleywine

overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
definitely
recommended
d
overall
quite
good
obviously
a
lot
of
everything
in
this
and
somewhat
challenging
to
the
palate
would
like
to
try
a
vintage
offering
for
comparison
will
rereview
at
such
time
i
think
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
affordable
not
so
radical
commercial
barleywine
because
of
the
great
balance
between
hops
malt
and
alcohol
content
i
had
it
on
draft
in
a
snifter
for
a
very
affordable
price
i
believe
under
5
the
color
was
very
clear
and
orangeyamber
with
little
visible
carbonation
smelled
of
whispy
cascade
hops
the
taste
was
also
of
cascade
crystal
malt
and
alcohol
but
not
in
an
extreme
sense
like
im
drinking
straight
vodka
mixed
into
a
normal
beer
it
was
very
well
balanced
with
the
alcohol
content
matching
the
overall
strong
character
of
the
beer
in
all
respects
towards
the
end
the
alcohol
started
getting
to
me
in
terms
of
drinkability
but
i
suppose
that
is
natural
once
your
mouth
gets
conditioned
to
the
hoppiness
you
can
further
enjoy
the
fruity
essence
in
this
barleywine
overall
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
good
stuff
but
strong
on
the
hops
chimaybier
for
my
first
experience
with
the
style
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
very
complex
although
it
mellows
very
nicely
as
it
warms
its
definitely
a
sipper
and
i
would
probably
just
have
the
one
ovr
first
of
all
big
thanks
to
brewandbbq
for
a
10
year
old
bigfoot
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
it
was
ag
reat
great
beer
i
got
the
farmiliar
figport
taste
of
a
good
aged
barly
wine
but
the
amount
of
hop
bite
still
left
in
this
was
unbeliveable
there
are
plenty
of
fresh
ipas
that
dont
pack
that
punch
mmmm
why
is
this
beer
kicking
my
ass
i
just
wanted
sometihing
simple
to
go
with
a
snack
of
crackers
and
cheese
oh
its
9
6
i
guess
its
ok
to
feel
a
little
buzz
still
have
that
nice
bitter
taste
in
my
mouth
went
down
so
smooth
what
a
drinkable
dangerous
beer
in
my
day
we
cellared
this
beer
for
years
on
end
to
mellow
it
out
effing
east
coasters
thought
it
was
too
hoppy
to
drink
right
away
it
certainly
ages
well
but
drinking
it
full
blown
like
this
that
works
too
i
enjoyed
this
years
barleywine
and
look
forward
to
next
years
spicy
carbonation
severely
bitter
hops
typical
of
sn
fairly
smooth
but
extremely
potent
medium
body
hoppy
and
syrupy
finish
this
doesnt
taste
so
much
like
a
barleywine
as
it
does
a
malty
ipa
in
that
respect
it
would
be
pleasing
except
for
the
estery
finish
but
im
not
convinced
it
fits
the
style
enough
still
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
brew
d
very
good
beer
i
have
come
to
expect
nothing
less
from
sierra
nevada
i
had
the
25th
expedition
bottle
brewed
in
2008
this
one
will
surely
go
in
the
stock
pile
when
i
come
across
it
again
drinkability
very
drinkable
if
it
wasnt
for
the
slight
burn
reminder
of
the
alcohol
content
i
could
have
several
in
one
sitting
i
feel
like
drinking
this
beer
at
this
age
isnt
fair
to
the
beer
its
almost
like
drinking
a
cab
sauv
too
young
i
really
think
this
beer
should
kick
ass
and
would
with
a
vit
of
time
in
the
cellar
i
want
to
revisit
this
vintage
in
a
couple
years
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
to
be
slowly
enjoyed
its
too
powerful
to
quaff
down
but
it
is
flavorful
and
complex
enough
to
evaluate
with
appreciation
ill
be
bock
for
another
purchase
of
this
one
what
a
beautiful
beer
served
in
a
6
oz
glass
filled
to
the
brim
with
an
off
white
head
spilling
out
the
top
the
beer
is
a
gorgeous
ruby
red
and
crystal
clear
stunning
the
aroma
is
a
little
disappointing
though
i
couldnt
get
much
except
some
floral
hops
it
tastes
very
crisp
for
the
style
its
not
sweet
but
fairly
ballanced
it
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
after
a
little
ways
through
the
glass
this
isnt
an
extreme
california
beer
just
a
good
barleywine
d
enjoyable
but
like
other
sierra
nevada
brews
ive
had
i
probably
couldnt
drink
more
than
two
of
these
in
a
row
due
to
the
overwhelming
flavor
12oz
bottle
2008
edition
purchased
from
bauer
wines
in
boston
pours

strong

aroma
the
first
sip
is
big
and
bold
a
lot
of
sensations
at
once
starts
with
a
tiny
bit
of
sweetness
with
maltiness
in
the
middle
followed
by
a
strong
hop
and
malt
aftertaste
the
aftertaste
is
heavy
and
warms
the
throat
flavourful
stuff
that
makes
you
take
notice
different
from
what
i
think
is
a
typical
barleywine
im
enjoying
this
more
and
more
the
more
i
have
it
great
success
heres
to
the
last
day
of
april
2008
i
recommend
highly
another
good
job
by
sierra
nevada
i
would
and
have
recommended
this
offering
and
am
going
back
for
more
this
weekend
they
dont
come
much
better
than
this
especially
this
side
of
the
pond
i
have
had
a
few
different
year
releases
of
the
big
foot
and
they
have
all
had
a
good
unique
taste
i
am
review
the
2008
release
i
enjoyed
it
chilled
in
a
snifter
poured
a
nice
thick
amber
color
with
a
mighty
creamy
head
smell
of
fruityness
hint
of
chocolate
a
little
piney
taste
of
dried
and
slightly
sour
fruits
good
hop
balance
pretty
slick
on
the
tongue
i
am
not
a
hops
lover
and
the
hops
quality
of
this
beer
would
prevent
me
from
having
it
often
much
less
having
several
oh
didnt
mention
the
hop
presence
of
this
bigfoot
which
was
subtle
and
balanced
this
is
one
if
the
defining
characteristics
of
this
particular
bigfoot
id
personally
call
it
slickfoot
since
its
not
too
incredibly
big
but
wont
go
unnoticed
but
for
the
most
part
i
look
forward
to
drinking
them
down
the
road
once
the
hops
has
mellowed
out
i
recommend
splitting
this
one
with
a
fellow

d
weird
as
it
sounds
the
drinkability
took
a
slight
hit
because
it
goes
down
so
easy
before
i
knew
it
the
glass
was
almost
empty
and
my
cheeks
felt
scorched
had
i
been
able
to
control
my
pace
i
might
have
been
able
to
enjoy
more
than
the
one
in
a
sitting
definitely
should
let
this
warm
up
a
bit
to
let
the
beer
breathe
and
release
its
goodness
the
back
end
left
you
questing
for
more
also
had
this
on
tap
and
it
was
just
as
good
mouthfeel
is
full
and
luscious
have
one
sip
it
and
savor
every
drop
i
would
not
recommend
this
for
an
extended
session
of
drinking
but
definitely
would
imbibe
and
enjoy
one
or
two
over
an
hour
or
so
this
one
is
getting
better
and
better
as
it
continues
to
approach
room
temperature
it
will
not
really
get
to
room
temperature
as
it
will
be
gone
by
then
d
not
really
all
that
drinkable
but
to
me
the
finest
things
are
best
enjoyed
in
this
beer
a
poured
a
reddish
copper
with
a
singlefinger
beige
head
the
scent
is
mostly
sweet
malt
with
some
fruity
and
floral
characteristics
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sweet
caramel
malt
that
quickly
gives
way
to
some
piney
hoppiness
that
lingers
and
finishes
with
a
little
bit
of
warming
from
the
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
with
a
fairly
low
amount
of
carbonation
and
pleasant
warming
from
the
alcohol
this
is
a
tasty
beer
thats
definitely
worth
a
try
but
i
think
it
might
sit
a
little
heavy
to
have
more
than
one
of
at
a
time
this
went
from
being
something
i
didnt
like
much
at
all
to
something
that
i
find
sort
of
drinkable
a
5
oz
snifter
or
something
like
that
would
have
been
fine
for
a
sitting
i
wouldnt
think
of
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
am
definitely
not
a
hop
head
so
ill
cut
the
beer
some
slack
but
am
not
going
to
give
this
an
a
just
because
everyone
else
has
either
ill
revisit
in
a
few
months
even
if
i
like
it
then
i
probably
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
an
expensive
beer
that
i
have
to
age
a
long
time
before
i
prefer
it
to
any
number
of
more
affordable
and
readily
available
beers
however
an
a
average
after
1000
reviews
suggests
that
this
is
a
beer
that
will
please
very
many
bas
d
a
little
too
harsh
for
my
liking
for
a
barley
wine
intense
and
interesting
but
not
a
session
beer
d
some
what
one
would
be
fine
for
me
i
think
ill
let
the
other
four
sleep
in
the
basement
a
bit
see
what
they
turn
into
overall
a
different
yet
great
representation
of
the
stye
its
nice
to
mix
up
the
usually
malty
beer
with
an
extra
dose
of
hops
poured
dark
orange
to
red
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
the
smell
was
very
loud
with
the
alcohol
hops
and
malts
coming
out
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
caramel
and
liquorish
flavor
of
the
malts
combined
with
the
strong
hops
and
alcohol
taste
worked
very
well
together
to
create
a
great
beer
for
sipping
drinkability
this
beer
has
a
good
deal
of
flavor
very
satisfying
love
this
beer
not
bad
but
not
great
not
something
ill
look
forward
to
next
winter
d
as
far
as

still
brings

back

that
is
just
right
in
the
bitter
department
a
little
difficult
to
drink
more
than
a
few
but
what
can
you
expect
from
such
a
huge
beer
cant
wait
to
try
next
years
thanks
sierra
nevada
for
25
years
of
raising
the
bar
m
d
good
body
but
the
bitterness
detracts
from
the
drinkability
a
touch
d
drinkability
is
good
it
is
big
and
strong
and
should
be
enjoyed
in
moderation
it
comes
across
as
a
great
sipping
beer
this
is
a
fine
sipping
brew
i
like
the
way
it
attacks
your
taste
buds
and
leaves
a
nice
lingering
flavor
this
is
my
first
bigfoot
ever
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
after
some
cellaring
2008
version
poured
into
a
duvel
glass
this
was
a
deep
amber
with
ruby
and
chestnut
highlights
showed
good
clarity
when
held
to
the
light
and
a
creamy
tan
head
persistent
lacing
coats
the
glass
thick
aromas
of

with

by

guess
i
must
have
been
greedy
in
06
the
2008
series
pours
a
deep
reddishbrown
with
small
whitish
head
it
starts
with
sierras
trademark
bitterness
upfront
but
leaves
a
great
floralfruity
aftertaste
the
smell
is
very
impressive
the
only
reason
for
the
4
0
on
the
taste
is
i
think
more
than
2
of
these
beers
would
be
tough
to
do
but
i
would
buy
this
beer
if
you
want
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
night
this
was
their
2008
25th
expedition
offering
the
beer
poured
a
clear
deep
reddishamber
with
creamy
almond
head
into
a
12oz
pilsner
glass
the
smell
was
of
sweet
malt
hops
and
alcoholic
esters
the
taste
was
that
classic
bigfoot
signature
of
intense
hop
bitterness
balanced
beautifully
with
the
sweet
fruity
malt
background
i
look
forward
to
this
release
every
year
a
barleywine
against
which
all
other
barleywines
should
be
judged
overall
a
good
barleywine
theres
certainly
a
lot
of
malt
in
this
one
my
only
complaint
is
that
this
beer
may
have
been
a
bit
greenyoung
i
think
a
few
years
of
cellaring
would
do
this
brew
very
well
and
round
out
those
rough
edges
i
will
definately
buy
some
more
for
the
cellar
d
wow
a
great
beer
certainly
not
a
session
or
anything
obviously
but
i
would
totally
order
this
at
the
pub
and
will
probably
by
some
more
this
weekend
very
enjoyable
to
just
sit
back
and
drink
slowly
definitely
recommended
i
can
see
why
theyve
been
doing
this
for
25
years
md
nice
full
bodied
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
present
sticks
to
the
tongue
a
little
alcohol
is
present
but
not
a
lot
of
warming
a
sipper
for
sure
due
to
just
huge
hoppiness
and
alcohol
seems
to
be
drinking
a
lot
like
a
big
ipa
right
now
maybe
with
some
time
the
malt
character
will
come
out
more
with
some
temperature
this
one
actually
mellows
in
the
glass
in
a
little
but
still
a
lot
of
hop
this
was
fun
my
first
07
of
this
new
season
seemed
underwhelming
but
my
research
carried
on
and
worked
out
for
the
better
as
it
seems
my
taste
buds
must
have
been
off
last
month
when
i
tried
it
if
you
want
something
brash
and
hoppy
the
08
is
definitely
a
drinker
now
if
you
want
something
sweeter
where
the
hops
are
discernible
from
the
malty
sweetness
age
is
the
key
this
buying
a
case
or
more
per
year
is
going
to
work
out
nicely
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
with
a
hoppy
aftertaste
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
good
if
you
are
in
to
the
barleywine
style
a
style
i
admit
i
am
new
to
this
beer
is
a
great
sipper
music
enjoyed
whilst
sampling
natural

by
bob
marley
pours
a
very
dark
reddish
brown
hints
of
purple
on
the
edge
decent
head
but
leaves
great
lacing
and
a
nice
ring
around
the
glass
smell
is
slightly
subdued
hops
juicy
citrus
bursting
around
some
sweet
malt
taste
is
initially
sweet
yet
vibrant
citrus
grapefruit
and
grassy
hops
a
bit
of
biting
hop
present
to
assert
itself
towards
the
end
very
good
malt
presence
to
balance
out
this
version
overall
this
is
wonderful
even
better
than
last
year
could
be
a
combination
of
my
expanding
palate
and
a
slighlty
tweaked
recipe
d
this
is
a
one
and
done
brew
that
i
was
happy
to
experience
but
this
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
beer
for
that
matter
d
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
this
is
a
brew
that
is
meant
to
age
right
now
i
can
tell
that
with
time
these
flavors
will
mold
together
a
bit
better
as
the
hops
drop
into
the
background
and
the
carbonation
settles
down
a
little
but
fresh
id
say
it
seems
too
hot
enjoyable
brew
none
the
less
this
beer
pours
a
dark
reddishgarnet
hue
with
one
finger
of
white
head
the
head
dissipated
very
quickly
on
this
but
at
9
6
that
can
be
expected
the
nose
is
classic
for
sierra
nevada
bold
hop
characteristics
showing
signs
of
all
of
the
chops
with
citrus
and
pine
making
themselves
known
on
the
nose
the
taste
brings
a
blast
of
powerful
malt
with
the
bitter
hop
flavoring
right
behind
it
i
taste
big
flavors
of
resinous
pine
grapefruit
and
sweet
caramel
the
sweet
malt
and
bitter
hops
are
very
well
done
on
this
brew
at
9
6
the
alcohol
is
present
as
well
but
is
in
no
way
cloying
at
all
in
the
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
big
chewy
and
sticky
with
the
alcohol
warmth
only
slightly
making
itself
known
the
drinkability
is
very
good
on
this
brew
and
i
would
gladly
purchase
again
deven
with
the
abv
i
would
be
happy
having
a
couple
of
these
or
be
happy
shortly
after
having
a
couple
of
these
poured
into
a
large
tulip
glass
duvel
glass
and
i
could
smell
the
fresh
fruity
hop
aroma
from
a
foot
away
aroma
is
fruity
grassy
and
of
hard
candy
a
unique
brown
color
that
just
looks
great
in
the
glass
flavor
is
nice
rich
sweet
maltiness
maybe
a
marris
otter
barley
rather
clean
taste
with
very
nice
hop
bite
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
biting
with
hop
bitterness
tastes
great
but
high
in
alcohol
so
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
to
many
of
them
in
one
night
copper
pour
with
very

you

what

but
can

you

a
solid
beer
but
seems
to
be
lacking
something
not
as
good
as
last
years
still
pretty
tasty
though
i
have
now
tasted
the
2008
vintage
and
can
report
that
it
is
much
the
same
in
my
opinion
i
had
the
2007
expeditiion
last
year
and
really
enjoyed
it
i
dont
remember
the
alcohol
being
as
noticable
in
that
one
i
think
im
going
to
put
away
four
of
the
2008
bottles
and
try
them
over
the
next
few
years
to
see
it
the
alcohol
calms
down
and
the
flavor
improves

i
can

to
try
this
batch
at
the
same
time
next
year
sn
does
not
know
how
to
make
a
good
malty
beer
in
my
opinion
the
stout
and
potter
are
overly
hopped
for
the
style
and
this
is
just
bitter
hops
as
well
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
but
as
a
malt
head
i
was
disappointed
the
many
hops
heads
out
there
might
like
this
though
whoa
this
is
one
of
those
very
rare
breeds
that
is
exactly
what
the
commercial
description
says
and
does
indeed
rate
a
perfect
score
the
interplay
and
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
is
wonderful
its
hard
to
tell
but
i
think
i
taste
the
yeast
in
there
too
plenty
of
lace
although
the
head
mostly
fades
after
a
time
looonnnngg
finish
i
later
had
the
2008
version
and
it
was
just
as
solid
d
take
it
slow
easy
sip
share
one
savour
id
like
to
put
one
of
these
away
and
come
back
to
it
in
a
few
months
to
see
whats
up
d
goes
down
very
easy
beware
of
the
abv
very
drinkable
for
a
young
barleywine
well
balanced
but
lacking
the
complexity
of
aged
barelywines
a
very
good
conservative
nonextreme
american
style
barleywine
moreys
bottom
line
somewhat
similar
in
taste
to
old
horizontal
but
with
more
of
a
hoppy
taste
very
satisfying
barleywine
to
say
the
least
i
have
a
few
in
the
basement
for
next
year
smell
is
overwhelmingly
piney
and
hoppy
taste
is
similar
little
to
no
sweet
fruit
content
just
a
bit
of
balancing
malt
im
not
saying
this
is
a
bad
beer
in
fact
its
a
pretty
good
one
while
not
what
i
typically
expect
from
a
barleywine
i
do
enjoy
it
quite
a
bit
25
years
its
yet
another
style
definitive
for
sierra
nevada
im
not
sure
its
my
absolute
favorite
barleywine
but
its
up
there
factor
in
the
ridiculously
low
price
for
a
6pack
and
you
see
why
bigfoot
is
such
an
anticipated
beer
here
we
reap
the
benefits
of
sierra
nevada
being
a
bigger
craft
brewer
and
thus
enjoying
greater
economies
of
scale
few
others
give
us
this
kind
of
value
drinkability
a
great
beer
to
sit
back
with
sip
and
enjoy
lots
to
appreciate
here
interesting
beer
ill
have
to
let
the
rest
of
the
6er
age
for
a
while
this
doesnt
have
the
same
tobacco
juice
bitterness
as
the
07
edition
but
this
years
offering
is
incredibly
mellow
and
smooth
highly
recommended
pours
a
dark
red
amber
color
from
the
bottle
with
a
short
but
thick
tan
colored
head
that
laces
the
sides
fo
the
glass
nice
earthy
hop
aroma
with
hints
of
fruit
and
maltyness
underneath
the
taste
is
bold
malted
barely
with
layers
of
fruit
underneath
an
earthy
hop
flavor
that
balances
the
beer
out
very
well
the
mouthfeel
is
good
very
crisp
and
complex
with
a
dry
finish
the
drinkability
is
ok
because
of
its
intense
flavor
definately
worth
it
so
i
think
i
must
have
stumbled
on
a
bottle
that
had
somehow
soured
in
one
way
or
another
the
color
was
excellent
however
a
nice
amber
red
bright
yet
opaque
but
a
very
small
head
that
dissipated
in
an
instant
smell
was
hard
to
explain
yet
very
pleasing
everything
else
was
just
bad
strong
alcohol
taste
that
gave
me
no
room
to
even
really
taste
anything
else
in
all
honesty
tasted
like
cheep
booze
to
me
also
everyone
is
raging
about
the
hops
yet
i
didnt
smell
or
taste
even
a
hint
something
had
to
be
wrong
with
this
brew
always
look
forward
to
this
seasonal
offering
i
missed
out
on
it
last
year
as
i
was
out
of
commission
so
this
year
is
even
more
exciting
if
you
like
big
hoppy
beers
this
is
for
you
a
very
enjoyable
barleywine
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
d
maybe
a
bit
too
bitter
for
me
today
but
i
usually
really
love
hoppy
brews
everything
is
behind
the
hops
in
this
one
id
like
it
more
balanced
maybe
after
several
years
itll
balance
out
d
an
absolutely
dynamite
barleywine
possibly
my
favourite
made
in
america
i
cant
wait
for
the
08
to
come
to
town
definitely
sierra
nevadas
finest
creation
d
friggin
great
wish
the
abv
wasnt
so
high
but
it
comes
with
the
barleywine
territory
d
would
have
one
at
a
time
i
cant
remember
this
beer
being
this
hoppy
its
been
about
2
years
since
i
had
it
last
not
quite
what
you
would
expect
from
a
barleywine
i
stashed
a
few
of
these
away
and
will
break
them
out
over
the
next
few
years
hopefully
the
hops
mellow
out
and
that
big
barleywine
flavor
comes
to
the
forefront

wonderful

of

present
behind
a
syrupy
blend
of
sweet
sugared
goodness
good
stuff
from
sierra
nevada
and
although
i
am
not
a
particularly
huge
fan
of
barleywines
this
was
an
overall
pleasing
satisfying
brew
that
could
be
enjoyed
over
a
long
period
of
time
recommended
might
just
be
the
year
i
had
will
try
again
in
the
future
to
see
how
newolder

stand
up

as
much
as
i
love

this
was
a
real
treat

citric

and
pervade
the
palate
quickly
on
a
thick
somewhat
sweet
black
fruit
malt
base
hops
are
forward
and
barely
allow
the
sticky
malt
presence
to
be
felt
but
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
as
the
beer
warms
these
flavors
begin
to
integrate
nicely
and
some
black
cherry
flavors
show
up
hop
aftertaste

almost
dries

rich

a
slight
orange
marmalade
very
well
balanced
certainly
built
for
the
cellar
very
very
tough
to
stay
away
from
this
beer
as
i
have
had
one
a
night
since
buying
the
sixer
overall
very
nice
beer
the
last
i
had
was
the
2006
version
which
i
didnt
really
remember
i
purchased
plenty
of
this
one
so
i
can
compare
it
to
next
years
and
to
complete
a
nice
vertical
somewhere
down
the
line
sn
did
it
right
with
this
one
drink
up
boys
treat
this
beer
with
the
respect
it
deserves
this
is
a
monster
beer
i
followed
this
up
with
another
huge
mythical
creature
the
yeti
and
was
done
for
the
night
i
cant
wait
till
the
bottles
hit
the
shelves
so
i
can
let
a
few
bigfeet
hibernate
in
my
cellar
for
a
few
years
overall
an
excellent
brew
and
now
a
staple
of
my
cellar
i
bought
lots
more
of
this
to
age
alongside
anchor
old
foghorn
should
be
interesting
as
time
goes
on
medium
to
full
bodied
chewy
sweet
with
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
and
average
carbonation
i
have
drank
this
beer
before
and
not
liked
it
but
cant
help
but
think
the
previous
bottles
were
bad
or
maybe
the
batch
was
this
years
bigfoot
is
very
good
if
the
beer
normally
tastes
like
this
no
wonder
it
is
so
popular
the
07
still
is
pretty
raw
i
had
my
last
05
a
couple
months
back
thinking
it
would
be
ready
i
was
wrong
bigfoot
can
settle
down
for
at
least
3
years
i
have
an
02
and03
in
the
cellar
but
now
have
to
score
another
4
and
5
to
complete
a
6
year
vertical
i
must
do
it
soon
if
you
can
help
beermail
me
ill
make
it
worth
your
while
a
great
barleywine
that
may
hinder
my
plan
to
age
my
only
other
bottle
even
though
barleywine
isnt
a
favorite
style
of
mine
this
one
really
hit
the
spot
on
a
cold
winter
night
and
was
way
more
complex
then
i
thought
it
could
at
such
a
high
abv
2007
vintage
pours
into
my
bigasswineglass
a
beautiful
dark
brown
cloudy
amber
color
with
nice
off
white
almost
manilla
head
the
nose
is
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
but
hops
are
slightly
more
apparent
in
the
nose
this
barleywine
is
a
great
balance
of
malt
and
hops
the
hops
are
not
as
powerful
as
i
had
expectedwhich
is
good
bc
i
am
a
bigger
fan
on
english
style
bwine
great
malty
backbone
but
with
hops
throughout
i
do
feel
this
taste
could
be
stronger
though
in
general
the
alcohol
flavors
are
very
well
hidden
good
malt
in
the
middle
but
a
nice
hoppy
bite
at
the
end
despite
that
this
beer
goes
down
exceptionally
smooth
very
nice
thick
mouthfeel
and
one
of
the
most
drinkable
barleywines
i
have
ever
had
a
great
offering
from
sierra
nevada
i
compliment
them
on
not
going
overboard
with
the
hops
on
this
one
as
i
had
expected
this
will
be
wonderful
after
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
awesome
2007
the
color
is
dark
amber
as
it
pours
from
the
bottle
and
a
slightly
hazy
redbrown
in
the
glass
with
very
little
head
the
smell
is
very
sweet
and
malty
but
the
hops
is
more
pronounced
in
the
taste
very
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
syrupy
with
low
carbonation
and
the
finish
it
quite
sticky
this
might
be
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
sierra
nevada
and
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
had
it
is
very
drinkable
too
two
or
three
bottles
of
this
with
a
nice
meal
and
a
rich
dessert
would
make
for
a
great
night
seemed
like
a
good
night
to
open
up
a
2001
bottle
poured
into
a
large
snifter
at
apprx
55
degrees
this
one
looks
great
albsolutely
no
head
dark
brown
in
color
i
never
cease
to
get
a
kick
out
of
this
stuff
the
nose
has
alot
of
sherry
notes
with
undertones
of
currant
most
of
the
hop
notes
have
faded
and
the
malt
nose
has
taken
over
the
taste
boast
a
good
amount
of
rich
sweet
maltiness
the
raw
alcahol
nose
has
long
since
faded
first
bigfoot
i
have
had
since
last
march
now
i
remember
why
i
buy
five
cases
of
this
every
year
true
hophead
if
thats
you
go
for
it
i
must
conclude
with
a
bit
of
a
reminisce
i
can
remember
getting
this
stuff
in
college
probably
around
1998
i
wish
i
saved
a
bottle
or
two
from
then
and
liking
it
even
though
in
those
days
i
was
a
sam
adams
is
great
guy
now
i
can
see
how
i
felt
that
way
this
beer
is
so
accessible
but
yet
so
awesome
still
now
just
awesome
ps
wtf
is
the
deal
with
that
guy
with
the
donkey
on
the
bottle
is
that
a
human
d
ill
buy
some
every
year
i
cant
wait
for
oh
eight
this
rates
right
up
there
tastewise
with
the
ayinger
celebrator
and
the
dogfish
head
90
minute
which
i
think
are
both
excellent
beers
the
store
i
bought
this
from
had
5
more
left
and
they
have
my
name
written
all
over
them
im
on
the
way
to
grab
these
i
was
really
excited
to
try
out
the
bigfoot
since
someone
always
mentions
bigfoot
whenever
sierra
nevada
is
mentioned
ive
never
had
a
barleywine
style
ale
poured
out
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
smelled
of
sweet
malts
and
strong
hops
and
a
fruity
wine
scent
the
taste
was
good
but
not
amazing
the
sweet
malts
and
hops
were
great
but
that
wine
flavor
behind
the
initial
taste
was
a
bit
too
much
for
me
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
wine
so
this
may
be
the
reason
but
for
me
it
wasnt
pleasant
overall
id
say
this
were
tolerable
and
a
good
beer
but
probably
not
my
favorite
out
of
the
sn
lineup
which
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
this
is
my
first
venture
into
the
barley
wine
style
of
ale
bigfoot
is
a
big
ale
that
makes
a
good
sippernight
cap
more
aging
should
help
tame
this
strong
ale
d
very
tasty
but
limited
to
probably
one
i
have
5
to
lay
down
and
might
get
more
d
easy
going
for
a
barley
wine
i
drank
this
as
my
4th
beer
of
the
night
but
it
should
have
been
first
very
enjoyable
sipper
taste
is
malty
and
bitter
great
balance
the
malt
is
sweet
and
has
a
bit
husky
taste
the
alcohol
is
pretty
warming
and
tends
to
get
a
bit
sharp
and
hot
the
hop
is
definatelly
cascade
and
is
citric
with
grapefruit
and
pineapple
a
very
fullbodied
beer
that
has
a
great
balance
had
the
extreme
plesure
of
sixyear
bottle
conditioning
tasteing
in
which
years
45
were
exceptionally
good
year
3
was
quite
good
with
anything
under
that
seemingly
young
tasting
after
year
5
the
qualities
that
make
it
a
stellar
barley
wine
were
fading
a
2000
8
years
old
was
also
on
tap
and
that
had
mellowed
even
more
but
had
still
kept
a
really
nice
maltiness
to
it
interestingly
this
poured
a
clear
reddish
brown
no
haze
it
seemed
to
be
a
touch
fruitier
than
the
04
and
definitely
an
08
on
tap
at
moan
and
dove
this
drink
had
a
murky
amber
appearance
with
a
mediumheavy
head
a
sharp
malty
aroma
flew
into
your
nose
when
sniffing
it
the
taste
was
very
balanced
a
perpetual
seesaw
between
sweet
and
sour
in
the
mouth
with
the
low
carbonation
drinking
this
beverage
was
very
smooth
overall
a
balanced
smooth
beer
4
d
its
good
to
drink
now
im
sure
it
will
be
even
better
in
the
future
yay
for
my
beer
cellar
i
may
have
this
beer
again
on
a
cold
day
but
the
high
alcohal
content
is
something
i
tend
to
stay
away
from
in
my
beer
pretty
drinkable
for
the
style
the
bitterness
is
pretty
pronounced
but
it
hides
the
alcohol
well
and
is
reasonably
balanced
pours
a
murky
and
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
rocky
particle
off
white
heead
smell
is
a
roasty
caramel
malt
scent
with
a
grape
wine
like
aroma
taste
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
good
deal
of
hops
that
have
obviously
mellowed
in
the
almost
two
years
of
aging
heavy
on
the
alcohol
with
a
nice
warming
presence
felt
nice
and
toasty
after
this
one
improving
from
last
year
better
balanced
and
i
believe
still
has
room
to
go
d
not
being
a
big
fan
of
aged
beers
i
was
not
expecting
to
enjoy
this
one
as
much
as
i
did
it
went
well
as
an
after
dinner
treat
on
a
cold
night
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
was
just
right
looking
forward
to
my
2002
and
2004
cracked
open
a
2005
vintage
the
other
night
good
stuff
deep
amber
and
all
with
a
smallish
tight
head
smells
grassy
and
citrusy
maybe
with
some
earthy
tones
ha
thats
dirt
in
there
tastes
well
interesting
i
guess
i
compare
all
barleywines
to
what
i
remember
the
smutty
as
being
so
compared
to
that
the
hop
profile
is
a
bit
more
well
shallow
as
in
there
are
two
peaks
one
in
citrus
and
one
in
bitter
but
nothing
between
them
and
i
guess
if
i
say
it
that
way
then
im
probably
faulting
it
in
some
way
too
well
its
not
that
its
definitely
a
good
beer
i
just
remember
liking
the
smutty
a
bit
more
that
is
just
a
question
of
personal
taste
so
i
obviously
cant
fault
it
for
that
cause
its
a
fine
beer
and
i
was
very
fortunate
to
obtain
a
bottle
ooh
and
to
drink
it
woo
hoo
d
the
alcohol
kick
that
shows
up
as
the
beer
warms
hurts
the
slow
sipping
enjoyment
that
i
feel
this
beer
deserves
i
want
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
it
but
i
find
myself
rushing
to
drink
it
while
its
still
cold
from
the
fridge
the
high
abv
has
never
allowed
me
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
notes
another
nice
year
for
bigfoot
ive
read
some
posts
about
the
hops
being
toned
down
and
there
does
seem
to
be
something
a
little
different
this
year
but
still
very
nice
this
one
taste
like
a
good
aging
candidate
as
well
tastes
of
grapefruity
hops
which
is
well
balanced
with
a
sweet
malt
that
makes
this
beer
so
damn
good
the
warming
alcohol
adds
just
the
right
touch
to
finish
a
night
d
a
very
good
barleywine
not
too
much
alcohol
so
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
also
an
awesome
example
of
an
agingfriendly
beer
i
will
be
getting
more
of
this
to
keep
in
my
closet
for
as
long
as
i
can
stand
slightly
hazy
ruby
red
chunky
with
light
visible
carbonation
head
is
rocky
and
durable
candy
alcohol
and
holiday
cheer
are
evident
in
the
aroma
which
is
very
warming
flavor
is
fullbodied
and
hoppier
than
expected
creme
brulee
sweet
and
wellrounded
as
it
warms
the
finish
takes
on
some
licorice
flavors
mouthfeel
is
thick
viscuous
tingly
with
alcohol
and
very
warming
im
deeply
ashamed
for
having
waited
this
long
to
sample
this
a
damn
fine
beer
experience
ill
enjoy
more
of
these
now
and
would
highly
recommend
that
anyone
cellaring
this
should
enjoy
some
at
this
point
it
will
be
interesting
to
revisit
it
as
a
review
after
a
year
this
would
pair
fantastically
with
a
big
bold
bleu
cheese
especially
the
creamy
feel
or
any
other
cheese
that
has
some
serious
strength
enjoy
this
now
this
beer
is
another
winner
from
sierra
nevada
drinks
less
like
a
barleywine
and
more
like
a
strong
ale
makes
me
remember
the
time
i
was
sitting
at
the
bar
and
i
drank
three
of
these
while
doing
the
crosswords
in
the
paper
then
i
lifted
my
head
up
and
was
smacked
right
in
the
face
with
the
alcohol
d
the
high
alcohol
is
a
bummer
but
still
if
you
want
a
gourmet
quality
beer
to
experience
definitely
a
great
choice
when
aged
d
had
to
pour
it
all
out
completely
undrinkable
it
tastes
like
another
4
155
edit
2008
edition
i
think
i
sold
this
one
short
when
reviewing
the
2007
the
flavor
profile
is
excellent
as
you
get
the
whole
range
from
the
sweet
malts
up
front
to
the
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
cant
wait
to
let
this
one
sit
for
a
year
and
revisit
a
delicious
looking
chunky
beige
head
sits
with
good
retention
on
top
of
an
amber
to
dark
copper
brew
caramel
malty
nose
some
hop
characters
of
floral
esters
and
citrus
fruits
full
bodied
with
a
less
than
chewy
mouthfeel
and
frothy
swill
flavor
is
extremely
hoppy
peppery
resiny
funky
sour
towards
the
middle
and
an
assertive
hoppy
pine
washes
over
the
rest
of
it
malt
and
toasted
grain
characters
sit
behind
the
hops
dry
bitter
finish
with
resiny
florals
and
burnt
sugars
biscuity
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
wanted
something
more
than
a
face
full
of
hops
perhaps
some
time
in
the
cellar
will
soften
its
edges
smell
is
packed
with
hops
taste
is
wow
there
is
so
much
going
on
with
the
taste
full
of
hops
with
orange
malt
spice
pine
and
grapefruit
flavors
really
complex
and
tasty
reminiscent
of
a
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
with
more
complexity
and
a
serious
hop
kick
i
dont
remember
what
the
other
bottles
tasted
like
but
the
aging
couldnt
have
hurt
this
mouthfeel
smooth
but
dense
and
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
and
warming
a
nice
brew
d
this
is
a
very
good
barley
wine
but
it
is
very
strong
and
requires
some
slow
sippin
d
screw
the
9
6
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
day
slowly
and
with
plenty
of
water
outstandingly
complex
flavors
shine
like
a
star
but
the
nose
doesnt
really
advertise
the
greatness
a
bit
more
pungency
in
the
nostrils
would
garner
this
a
perfect
5
0
from
this
fella
a
big
bold
and
seriously
heavily
hopped
barelywine
this
falls
into
the
realms
of
dipa
in
some
regards
but
its
still
an
amazing
treat
for
the
taste
buds
this
brew
is
a
big
chewy
glassful
but
definitely
a
sipper
i
love
hops
so
i
may
just
have
to
say
this
is
the
best
barleywine
i
have
had
wish
i
could
get
this
more
often
thanks
to
bob
for
the
sample
drinkability
this
is
an
awesome
beer
im
gonna
buy
some
more
and
age
them
to
see
if
i
can
taste
the
differences
i
like
im
hoping
to
age
the
2006
vintage
for
much
longer
and
acquire
more
of
this
beer
probably
going
to
buy
a
vintage
pack
of
these
at
stuffed
sandwich
next
time
and
try
19972003
and
see
if
those
have
gotten
better
over
time
although
ten
years
might
be
too
long
first
time
that
i
tried
this
i
was
in
college
and
bought
it
because
of
the
abv
to
get
drunk
i
thought
it
was
the
nastiest
beer
i
had
ever
had
this
is
my
first
one
since
then
and
now
i
love
it
this
is
an
06
im
trying
pours
out
a
dark
ruby
amber
with
a
full
head
that
retains
and
laces
thick
all
around
smells
of
dark
fruit
fig
alcohol
and
hops
taste
is
delicious
ripe
plumb
brown
sugar
and
a
bang
of
delicious
hops
my
face
is
now
comfortably
numb
well
warm
anyways
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
carbonation
presence
i
love
the
hop
profile
in
this
brew
and
it
is
very
drinkable
especially
considering
the
abv
the
1
year
has
done
well
for
this
barleywine
the
years
since
college
have
done
well
for
my
palate
oh
how
things
change
i
had
two
pints
and
could
have
indulged
in
more
if
i
didnt
have
to
drive
home
very
nice
i
will
be
back
for
more
pours
a
dark
rusty
orange
with
a
small
tan
head
that
broke
down
into
a
blotchy
collar
leaving
patches
of
tight
lacing
on
my
pint
glass
the
aroma
is
spicy
with
piney
hops
and
sweet
malt
has
a
slight
fruity
smell
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
tasted
it
has
a
mellow
malty
body
with
grassy
hop
bitterness
alcohol
heat
becomes
more
pronounced
as
it
warms
lightly
carbonated
with
a
full
body
this
is
a
robust
and
tasty
barleywine
and
a
definite
must
try
note
i
didnt
check
my
review
of
the
2005
version
before
doing
this
one
surprisingly
i
gave
them
identical
scores
but
as
i
said
above
i
like
this
beer
fresh
or
aged
this
was
my
first
venture
into
the
world
of
barleywines
picked
up
some
vintage
2006
bottles
to
test
the
waters
as
soon
as
the
cap
was
popped
i
could
smell
the
sweet
aromas
awaiting
to
be
poured
into
my
glass
poured
a
deliciously
dark
hazy
walnut
color
with
nice
2
finger
head
with
massive
appeal
the
caramel
malt
and
fruity
aroma
was
almost
overpowering
initial
taste
was
incredibly
malty
with
a
nice
brown
sugarlike
sweetness
and
pleasant
citrusy
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
incredible
thick
and
chewy
definately
an
impressive
brew
if
you
can
drink
a
6er
of
this
i
tip
my
hat
to
ya
for
me
one
and
im
done
a
meal
in
itself
definately
will
buy
more
in
the
future
2008
is
also
highly
recommended
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
brown
with
a

tan
head
which
quickly
left
the
aroma
is
malty
and
caramel
there
are
also
some
spices
noticeable
the
taste
is
hoppy
and
bitter
with
spices
present
the
malt
does
a
good
job
of
balancing
the
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
full
but
not
heavy
overall
this
is
a
delightful
beer
that
ill
be
happy
to
stash
away
to
see
how
it
cellars
d
usually
not
a
huge
barleywine
fan
but
this
is
still
an
ale
in
the
perfect
way
to
make
things
drinkable
nice
one
big
brew
for
those
with
a
big
taste
for
hops
overall
exceptional
beer
and
worth
every
penny
of
extra
change
dthis
is
probably
the
second
barleywine
i
ever
had
after
old
foghorn
and
i
still
like
it
today
the
drinkability
is
so
good
for
a
beer
of
its
strength
that
i
have
been
known
to
polish
off
a
sixer
of
this
in
my
younger
days
despite
the
hops
winning
the
day
there
is
still
an
overall
balance
that
is
appreciated
and
is
rare
for
the
style
drinkability

for
as
big
a
beer
as
this
one
is
it
goes
down
amazingly
smooth
i
have
sampled
6
abv
brews
that
dont
go
down
like
this
one
it
is
still
a
sipper
at
9
6
abv
but
i
could
easily
have
another
one
its
certainly
drinkable
but
as
others
have
said
you
need
time
to
enjoy
this
beer
and
you
could
plan
an
evening
around
a
six
pack
of
this
stuff
strong
as
it
is
i
would
have
loved
another
so
i
think
its
quite
drinkable
overall
it
is
a
good
sipping
beer
do
not
buy
this
beer
if
you
dont
intend
on
spending
some
time
with
it
a
very
big
beer
in
taste
i
am
used
to
barleywines
with
a
higher
maltsweetness
to
hops
ratio
than
this
but
this
is
good
too
o
if
this
was
my
first
time
trying
bigfoot
there
probably
would
not
be
a
second
time
there
is
some
definite
oxidation
that
doesnt
work
very
well
with
the
hops
this
was
the
last
year
of
the
twistoff
tops
hopefully
the
08s
in
the
basement
have
held
up
better
to
be
fair
im
going
to
try
get
a
single
bottle
of
this
stuff
next
time
i
go
to
the
distributor
which
allows
breaking
up
of
sixpacks
ill
amend
my
review
whether
or
not
my
impression
has
changed
d
overall
a
highly
drinkable
example
of
the
style
which
seems
wellprepared
for
cellaring
ive
gone
through
3
bottles
of
a
sixpack
and
i
look
forward
to
seeing
how
the
other
three
age
a
very
good
beer
definitely
recommended
top
class
i
only
give
it
a
4
on
drinkability
because
you
cant
chug
it
at
9
6
abv
you
probably
wouldnt
want
to
not
for
mowing
or
yardwork
didnt
i
have
a
flower
bed
definitely
a
thick
head
in
the
glass
not
much
lacing
in
a
bass
ale
glass
its
a
beautiful
reddishgold
when
held
to
the
sun
smells
like
hops
citrus
and
malt
as
hoppy
as
a
double
ipa
the
mouthfeel
not
the
taste
is
like
biting
down
on
homemade
bread
a
very
satisfying
beer
alc
096x12oz

or

i
have
a
case
in
my
cellar
to
see
what
happens
overall
a
great
beer
even
warm
andor
flat
well
worth
the
cost
poured
into
my
delirium
snifter
this
2007
expedition
bigfoot
appears
a
dense
copper
orange
color
with
some
crazy
cranberry
hues
that
shine
through
when
held
up
to
the
light
good
looking
head
with
some
sticky
lacy
residue
left
behind
as
the
beer
recedes
smells
hoppy
like
a
lot
of
nice
ipas
ive
had
before
i
know
the
sn
brewing
company
is
known
for
hoppy
seasonals
but
i
had
no
idea
their
barleywine
style
would
be
quite
so
complex
in
the
hop
factor
too
well
played
snbc
well
played
the
taste
is
genuinely
hoppy
with
a
crazy
strong
malt
character
built
in
lots
of
fruit
here
too
but
its
almost
too
heavily
masked
by
the
hop
content
i
love
this
flavor
but
i
think
it
would
be
just
as
good
if
it
were
a
bit
milder
mouthfeel
is
hefty
im
not
sure
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
several
different
reasons
it
appeals
to
a
certain
beer
drinker
and
thats
just
fine
with
me
because
i
am
that
certain
type
of
beer
drinker
but
its
not
an
accessible
beer
by
the
masses
it
cant
be
and
thats
what
makes
it
that
much
better
still
tis
a
fine
beer
and
one
that
will
keep
me
running
on
fumes
for
the
better
part
of
the
afternoon
cheers
snbc
d
certainly
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
ive
had
due
to
the
raw
and
powerful
flavors
from
the
hops
and
the
alcohol
this
was
my
first
barley
wine
and
i
found
it
intriguing
id
like
to
age
a
few
of
these
to
see
if
it
will
smooth
things
over
and
mellow
it
out
a
bit
beer
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
white
head
that
is
leaving
decent
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
very
pleasant
heavily
perfumed
by
the
citrusy
floral
hops
taste
is
a
blast
malts
and
a
large
amount
of
hops
that
dominate
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
an
almost
chewy
quality
overall
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
respresentation
of
the
barleywine
style
this
years
is
a
special
gift
it
is
their
traditional
bigfoot
but
with
more
hops
and
man
do
i
love
the
hops
it
has
the
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
end
with
hops
lingering
on
the
tounge
wonderfull
i
will
buy
all
i
can
find
had
right
after
a
2006
and
quite
a
bit
more
hops
cant
say
enough
this
is
like
bigfoot
mated
with
celebration
and
a
beautiful
brew
was
born
will
call
it
celebrafoot
its
that
good
folks
jerry
a
good
welcomed
carbonation
lightens
up
the
brew
and
accentuates
the
sharpness
on
the
tongue
overall
a
very
nice
selection
i
would
like
to
give
it
another
year
2007
edition
of
the
first
barleywine
i
ever
tasted
a
flourishing
bouquet
of
thick
head
occupying
half
a
snifter
dark
crimson
to
the
eye
slightly
opaque
soft
hops
hint
of
vanilla
come
forth
hops
that
dig
into
the
teeth
my
whole
mouth
is
alive
when
chewing
though
the
flavor
is
directly
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
no
taste
of
alcohol
congrats
to
the
brewers
on
a
fine
creation
in
about
a
year
delicious
i
will
get
back
to
this
in
a
couple
of
years
it
might
develop
in
a
very
interesting
way
you
can
taste
the
9
6abv
but
it
hides
nicely
in
this
well
crafted
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
and
it
should
get
better
and
better
as
it
ages
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
an
ample
longlasting
cafe
au
lait
head
copious
lacing
which
travels
all
the
way
down
the
glass
citrus
hops
in
the
aroma
and
some
sweet
fruits
as
well
hop
presence
in
the
flavor
but
balanced
with
a
lot
of
sweet
malt
and
then
a
final
hop
jolt
in
the
finish
this
would
make
a
fine
dipa
as
well
as
a
barley
wine
either
way
its
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
2007
is
my
favorite
bigfoot
for
sure
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
abw
that
i
would
consider
buying
more
of
this
beer
seems
balanced
and
light
enough
to
be
a
double
ipa
rather
than
a
barleywine
really
personally
id
rather
drink
this
than
a
hercules
double
ipa
or
maybe
even
a
maharaja
this
beer
gets
high
marks
for
the
fumes
and
the
view
but
i
would
reach
for
a
bw
with
a
little
more
substance
and
sweetness
as
my
personal
preference
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
is
a
dark
amber
with
tints
of
red
and
is
topped
by
a
112
finger
tan
head
the
head
is
very
frothy
and
leaves
heavy
rings
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
strong
citrus
oil
that
is
both
flowery
and
fruity
the
taste
is
pretty
heavy
alcohol
and
has
a
good
amount
of
hoppiness
and
malt
flavors
that
are
way
up
there
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
bodied
and
very
tangy
this
is
a
good
one
a
mediumpour
into
a
bulb
yields
a
twofingered
mediumtan
head
excellent
lacing
pours
a
moderatelyhazey
copperamber
in
color
with
ample
yeast
settling
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
hops
are
very
expressive
on
the
nose
with
a
sort
of
buffettable
of
bitterness
and
floral
hop
qualities
earthy
both
in
the
hops
and
malt
qualities
almost
smells
dirty
like
the
roots
of
a
plant
being
transplanted
vegetal
qualities
are
underlying
the
floral
and
citric
hop
notes
and
there
are
a
number
of
fruit
notes
here
too
ripe
plum
raisin
fig
and
of
course
aniselicorice
some
diacetyl
but
onstyle
licorice
and
hop
bitebitterness
are
al
over
the
first
sip
followed
by
a
rounding
plummy
toffee
quality
and
a
bit
of
butterscotch
even
after
just
a
sip
theres
a
sincere
alcohol
presence
in
this
one
this
brew
means
business
notes
of
apple
red
and
green
in
the
aromatics
which
play
nicely
with
the
floral
hops
if
i
said
i
detect
cherry
blossoms
here
you
wouldnt
accuse
me
of
floral
prose
would
ya
bitterness
is
very
pronounced
and
an
aquired
taste
but
is
onstyle
very
par
for
the
course
as
per
my
bigfoot
reminiscenses
theres
a
lemonycitric
and
even
minty
quality
to
the
hops
on
the
palate
and
its
worth
noting
that
this
has
a
rather
dry
characteristic
as
it
is
still
rather
fresh
age
should
smooth
that
out
a
bit
some
cherry
notes
in
this
too
but
faint
body
is
mediumfull
and
becomes
a
bit
more
round
as
this
warms
caramel
notes
sre
here
about
midway
through
and
really
work
well
with
the
fresh
hops
and
fruit
characteristics
throughout
the
caramel
notes
too
should
become
more
pronounced
as
this
ages
over
the
next
couple
of
years
full
mouthfeel
with
nicecrisp
carbonation
but
not
overly
carbonated
despite
a
considerable
heft
this
is
indeed
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
worth
picking
up
by
the
case
bigfoot
really
holds
up
down
the
line
a
nice
deep
red
with
a
12
finger
of
head
which
dosent
hang
around
to
long
has
a
piny
citrusy
smell
which
seems
a
little
less
extreem
then
in
most
barlywines
altough
im
blessed
with
a
diminished
sense
of
smell
taste
up
front
of
bitter
hops
and
citrus
and
leads
to
a
much
more
subtle
taste
of
malts
and
a
rather
apprent
alcohol
taste
feels
like
relitivly
big
beer
should
cirtianly
not
completly
masking
the
9
6
but
i
may
be
able
to
drink
two
in
one
sitting
at
9
6
abv
i
wont
be
pounding
back
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
anytime
soon
tasty
but
definitely
a
sipping
and
not
a
session
beer
drinkability
id
only
had
an
english
barleywine
before
so
the
american
version
was
very
unique
and
very
awesome
the
american
version
is
very
different
as
it
is
less
malty
but
much
more
intensely
hopped
and
flavored
you
could
definetly
call
this
beer
bittersweet
though
not
in
the
traditional
sense
as
it
was
first
richly
sweet
then
a
nice
intensely
bitter
aftertaste
i
can
see
how
this
one
has
become
a
classic
bringing
barleywines
to
a
much
wider
audience
and
this
brew
definetly
brought
it
the
flavor
and
intensity
did
not
disappoint
and
i
definetly
look
forward
to
my
other
5
though
i
think
ill
age
some
sierra
nevada
has
another
winner
no
surprise
there
very
rich
and
almost
syrupy
and
finishes
slightly
warm
d
too
strong
to
have
many
but
a
decent
example
of
the
style
damn
this
beer
still
knocks
my
socks
off
big
estery
malts
with
big
citrus
hops
rolled
into
an
explosive
barleywine
the
balance
aspect
of
this
brew
falters
a
bit
from
the
kick
making
a
little
tough
to
drink
its
almost
like
the
flavor
is
too
big
im
going
to
have
to
stow
some
bottles
away
in
a
cellarcloset
and
see
what
they
can
do
after
a
couple
years
overall
this
was
a
very
good
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
will
have
another
tonight
the
abv
is
higher
than
i
think
ive
had
before
for
beer
but
i
did
notice
that
the
flavor
was
much
more
complex
than
the
beers
with
lower
abvs
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
slight
head
that
recedes
quickly
smell
is
bittering
hops
strong
and
dominating
taste
is
more
the
same
cant
even
tell
if
the
underlying
barleywine
is
any
good
because
the
hops
are
all
thats
there
i
just
dont
get
the
fascination
with
this
beer
i
guess
it
cant
be
for
everyone
i
feel
this
is
just
a
highly
overrated
beer
that
i
just
cant
figure
out
drinkability
isnt
that
high
though
the
alcohol
which
fits
is
really
apparent
and
this
one
for
me
at
least
really
lingers
theres
a
lot
going
on
and
it
really
hits
me
hard
as
im
not
that
experienced
in
bigbold
hoppy
brews
yet
my
limit
is
two
of
these
guys
its
a
good
sipper
just
not
something
ill
be
sitting
with
all
night
d
with
solid
flavors
from
the
hop
and
malt
camps
coming
at
you
its
hard
to
not
reach
for
another
one
of
these
after
a
few
the
abv
might
set
you
straight
but
nevertheless
this
beers
no
slouch
on
interesting
flavor
characteristics
given
the
alcohol
running
rampant
its
still
quite
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
i
see
myself
having
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
given
time
im
curious
to
see
what
this
may
taste
like
after
a
year
of
aging
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
barlywine
style
ale
was
a
redbrown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
the
head
had
good
retention
and
left
some
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
full
of
hops
and
fruit
with
noticeable
alcohol
the
taste
was
lots
of
sweet
malt
with
a
big
hop
kick
and
a
bitter
throat
warming
finish
it
was
mediumfull
in
body
with
fairly
light
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
this
was
a
great
beer
that
i
will
definately
have
again
and
again
dit
is
quite
good
but
big
abv
keeps
from
higher
number
here
da
its
a
sipper
you
need
to
enjoy
slowly
d
i
dont
want
to
put
this
beer
down
i
have
a
few
more
2006s
in
the
fridge
and
they
will
be
tough
to
save
d
a
strong
beer
but
one
that
is
really
tasty
and
practically
begs
to
be
drank
but
slowly
a
hoppy
intense
barleywineclassic
a
deep
amber
color
with
slight
visibility
of
carbonation
a
thin
layer
of
a
head
forms
on
top
that
is
creamy
in
color
a
strong
malty
aroma
followed
by
some
intense
spicy
almost
peppery
and
citrus
fragrances
plus
the
small
scent
of
alchol
the
malt
starts
the
flavor
out
then
the
hop
overtake
the
sweet
flavor
intense
hop
flavors
from
grapefruit
pine
to
pepper
there
is
just
alot
going
on
thiese
flavors
linger
on
the
palate
for
some
time
a
thin
feel
at
the
start
but
it
gains
strength
and
begins
to
roll
to
the
bcak
of
the
throat
leaving
the
palate
dry
this
is
a
solid
barleywine
very
good
to
sip
on
when
it
is
cold
outside
the
solid
flavor
and
aroma
plus
it
is
one
of
the
first
american
barley
wines
ever
created
make
this
a
must
try
beer
overall
an
excellent
and
slightly
unusual
barley
wine
a
very
american
twist
on
the
style
i
prefer
my
barley
wines
to
be
a
little
more
malty
than
this
but
it
is
definitely
recommended
i
have
a
couple
more
of
these
and
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
they
develop
with
a
couple
of
years
aging
drinkability
i
love
strong
hoppy
beers
i
consider
this
exceptional
within
that
realm
superb
tasting
with
amazing
balance
overall
a
nice
sipping
beer
very
warming
so
would
be
good
on
a
cold
winter
day
i
think
i
would
enjoy
this
more
if
it
was
aged
a
couple
of
years
so
that
the
flavors
could
meld
and
mellow
more
sorry
to
hate
on
sierra
nevada
today
but
this
2007
bigfoot
i
find
to
be
way
over
the
top
it
looks
pretty
a
reddishbrown
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
it
smells
interesting
intense
hops
almost
make
my
eyes
water
grapefruit
pine
like
an
ipa
and
theres
a
bit
of
toastyroasty
malt
in
there
to
boot
i
just
find
the
taste
as
really
unbalanced
with
hops
and
alcohols
dominant
and
im
a
bit
of
a
hophead
myself
preferring
strong
ales
i
assume
this
will
be
much
better
after
a
couple
of
years
i
drank
two
out
of
my
sixpack
and
will
be
cellaring
the
rest
in
as
little
as
six
months
this
beer
has
transformed
from
a
super
hopbomb
that
is
a
bit
harsh
into
a
smooth
and
elegant
brew
more
nut
flavors
caramelized
sugar
banana
and
chocolate
flavors
present
hop
flavors
have
pretty
much
diminshed
bitterness
is
still
high
worth
the
wait
for
contrast
alone
not
to
mention
the
superb
flavor
pours
a
ruby
hued
amber
with
good
head
that
fell
to
just
a
ring
around
the
edge
light
c
hops
aroma
but
it
doesnt
dominate
this
taste
is
why
you
drink
good
american
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
some
mild
friction
from
the
alcohol
and
hops
softripened
cheese
the
dark
creamy
flavor
of
the
cheese
will
complement
the
brightness
of
the
beer

with

that

the

that

sticky

the
aroma
was
largely
of
american
hops
giving
it
a
red

aroma
with

notes
that
fight

be

the
taste
gives
off

with
a
red

taste
that
overwhelms
all
in
the
first
taste
with
a
malty
backbone
following
in

the
mouthfeel
was

are

here
all
9
6
of
the
abv
shows
up
overall
a
better
dipa
than
a
barleywine
but
it
even
does
that
well
as
the
hops
die
down
and
other
flavors
emerge
over
time
this
brew
will
be
one
of
the
best
solid
this
year
more
enjoyable
than
the
2006
if
i
recall
worth
getting
a
few
bottles
im
not
sure
if
i
will
cellar
much
of
this
i
think
i
would
rather
try
to
enjoy
the

freshness
while
it
lasts
this
one
truly
impresses
me
thanks
sn
for
a
fine
brew
drinkability
is
excellent
though
the
high
abv
will
get
you
loopy
if
youre
feeling
really
froggy
though
i
expect
you
could
drink
3
of
these
things
before
you
realize
what
youve
done

13
months
later
and
the
2007
batch
still
has
a
strong
presence
of
those
sprucey
piney
sn
hops
i
expected
it
to
be
more
focused
on
the
malt
it
did
seem
to
lose
something
in
the
nose
however
i
seem
to
get
more
booze
in
the
nose
as
well
still
solid
and
not
all
that
much
different
from
what
i
remember
d
a
bit
young
but
i
got
a
bunch
of
these
and
letting
them
sit
will
turn
out
to
be
a
good
decision
well
see
how
it
does
in
a
couple
of
years
still
very
tasty
with
the
hops
dominating
the
palate
a
sipping
brew
for
sure
but
one
i
look
forward
to
every
year
drinkability
ok
i
am
scoring
this
lower
in
drinkability
for
two
reasons
one
while
this
is
a
tasty
beer
i
have
one
and
am
done
i
do
not
want
another
two
as
i
mentioned
this
one
may
do
well
with
a
bit
of
aging
but
i
dont
age
beers
i
drink
them
right
away
also
at
10
a
six
here
in
nebraska
its
a
bit
pricey
for
me
to
purchase
not
such
an
ugly
duckling
after
all
often
the
bigfoots
bigfeet
need
some
age
sure
some
maturity
might
be
interesting
with
this
specimen
but
the
sassy
edgy
nature
of
this
youngster
is
a
breath
of
fresh
sierra
nevada
air
even
in
its
tender
years
theres
nothing
not
to
like
and
while
the
abv
may
be
beefy
its
worked
in
and
warming
its
serious
but
it
drinks
with
a
knowing
grin
so
it
may
end
up
wearing
some
age
well
but
i
might
not
let
it
rest
long
enough
to
really
find
out
drinkability
for
how
young
this
is
i
found
it
to
be
a
stellar
barleywine
already
right
from
the
looks
it
has
everything
going
for
it
great
flavors
that
blended
well
and
im
sure
it
will
only
get
better
with
time
got
an
extra
bottle
to
lay
down
and
im
going
to
struggle
not
to
open
it
d
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
and
the
hops
are
a
tad
hot
i
am
going
to
have
to
revisit
this
i
am
very
anxious
to
see
how
this
ages
i
have
my
hopes
up
the
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
coats
the
tongue
nicely
the
overall
drinkability
is
excellent
for
something
at
close
to
10
abv
i
could
easily
sip
this
beer
all
night
i
am
planning
on
cellaring
a
good
bit
of
this
year
because
i
feel
it
has
potential
to
really
mature
nicely
excellent
job
this
year
sn
and
looking
for
to
having
this
many
time
again
2007
bottle
pured
into
a
snifter
yes
i
have
been
waiting
for
this
one
for
awhile
now
the
color
is
nice
amberred
with
a
short
white
head
that
needed
a
little
coaxing
the
smell
was
slightly
piney
and
really
awesome
i
actually
had
to
sniff
the
beer
for
a
couple
minutes
before
i
took
my
first
drink
the
taste
was
very
hoppy
pine
with
a
slight
hint
of
bubblegum
i
dont
know
where
that
comes
from
but
i
have
detected
it
in
ruination
at
times
i
didnt
get
any
of
the
chocolate
flavors
that
are
showing
up
in
the
06
right
now
this
beer
was
amazing
fresh
and
it
will
probably
only
get
better
i
think
i
better
buy
another
case
before
this
stuff
is
gone
damn
close
2007
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
i
just
bought
this
last
week
but
i
think
its
only
been
out
for
about
a
month
so
this
is
relatively
fresh
pours
a
nice
redamber
color
with
a
nice
solid
head
that
is
not
too
big
but
leaves
tremendous
lacing
and
is
really
sticky
on
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
extremely
floral
with
a
some
pine
and
maybe
even
a
bit
of
soapiness
i
like
it
though
taste
is
hops
hops
and
more
hops
with
some
grapefruit
rind
in
the
finish
theres
an
initial
sweetness
that
gets
slaughtered
quickly
by
the
hoppiness
some
aging
would
definitely
tone
this
down
mouthfeel
is
nice
almost
chewy
the
carbonation
lends
a
nice
crispness
even
though
this
is
super
hoppy
it
is
quite
drinkable
as
a
sipping
beer
this
is
one
to
be
savored
highly
recommended
2007
aged
1
month
poured
into
a
chimay
trappist
glass
pours
a
deep
red
mahogany
with
a
thick
1
creamy
head
head
slowly
disappears
leaving
good
lacing
behind
and
after
every
sip
smells
like
a
super
hopped
ipa
tastes
like
a
super
hopped
ipa
with
the
barleywine
sweetness
sneaking
in
towards
the
end
poured
with
a
slight
chill
about
50
degrees
but
flavors
started
opening
up
the
warmer
it
got
for
a
barley
wine
it
was
incredibly
drinkable
cant
wait
to
see
what
the
rest
of
the
6
pack
taste
like
down
the
road
the
body
is
quite
thick
the
carbonation
is
sharp
on
the
palate
has
a
nice
warming
alcohol
sting
but
still
quite
mild
for
the
strength
very
drinkable
for
being
so
strong
as
well
i
will
be
interested
to
see
how
this
one
develops
over
time
but
given
how
much
i
am
enjoying
it
i
think
i
might
have
to
buy
an
additional
case
afterall
i
like
this
at
least
twice
as
much
as
last
years
and
i
only
have
one
left
out
of
my
06
case
mouthfeeldrinkabilityvery
smooth
i
actually
prefer
this
to
old
guardian
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
i
wouldnt
characterize
it
as
a
session
beer
very
good
beer
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
nice
creamy
offwhite
head
with
nice
retention
and
lacing
a
nice
sweet
caramel
and
lively
piney
and
grapefruit
hop
aroma
with
some
alcohol
in
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
is
incredible
hop
heads
rejoice
this
beer
fulfills
any
craving
for
hops
one
might
have
the
hops
dominate
the
start
and
make
way
for
a
little
apperance
from
the
malt
and
then
the
hops
are
full
throttle
all
the
way
through
the
finish
and
linger
for
quite
some
time
on
the
palate
delicious
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
the
hard
part
will
be
saving
some
of
these
to
cellar
for
later
i
just
want
to
drink
them
all
up
while
they
are
fresh
came
in
today
in
a
six
pack
to
the
north
coast
coop
here
in
eureka
ca
poured
a
rich
ruby
color
with
a
nice
fat
offwhite
head
that
left
excellent
rings
of
lacing
was
very
high
on
appearance
nose
was
malts
fruits
and
vanilla
and
quite
nice
very
rich
mouthfeel
was
almost
cloying
flavor
was
mostly
of
malts
fruits
and
a
touch
of
hops
while
this
did
not
hold
a
candle
to
the
excellent
mad
river
john
barleycorn
i
drank
a
couple
of
days
ago
it
was
still
pretty
good
alcohol
is
hidden
well
and
overall
it
is
quite
drinkable
wow
love
this
beer
havent
sampled
any
other
vintage
so
its
hard
to
compare
but
this
beer
is
definitly
right
on
for
the
style
pours
an
awesome
red
amber
with
a
nice
head
that
slowly
disapates
into
great
lacing
the
nose
smells
greatly
of
hops
and
grapefruit
slightly
piney
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
a
pineyhopgrapefruit
montage
that
blasts
my
pallate
full
on
very
drinkable
very
warming
i
dont
find
the
9
6
to
be
a
hinderance
rather
a
nice
reward
for
a
long
winter
coming
to
an
end
definitly
my
favorite
barleywine
ive
sampled
so
far
great
beer
overall
a
good
and
solid
beer
ive
waited
a
while
to
get
this
in
again
and
it
hasnt
really
failed
me
i
will
certainly
buy
more
to
store
and
i
think
in
a
few
months
this
one
will
be
a
gem
drinkability
is
excellent
this
tastes
great
fresh
i
dont
think
i
really
want
to
age
this
too
much
i
really
like
the
hoppiness
this
year
this
is
a
very
flavorful
beer
but
it
is
still
quite
drinkable
as
soon
as
the
beer
evacuates
from
the
bottle
into
my
goblet
an
immediate
kick
of
grassy
hop
aroma
smacks
the
snotty
crust
off
of
my
face
buttressed
by
a
substantial
malt
foundation
rumbloated
raisins
warm
cotton
candy
the
hops
once
i
dig
my
nose
into
the
brew
become
more
complex
than
simply
grassy
theyre
huge
here
an
entire
landscape
of
freshly
peeled
citrus
rinds
and
cut
grass
pinches
of
pine
resin
huge
along
with
a
mild
flash
of
alcohol
heat
the
colors
a
translucent
russet
has
a
sheen
to
it
the
heads
at
least
an
inch
tall
tan
and
deflates
slowly
leaving
curdled
swaths
of
lace
on
the
goblet
walls
the
taste
opens
from
the
periphery
of
my
palate
for
a
split
second
before
the
onslaught
of
hop
bitterness
caves
in
at
a
deliberately
massive
pace
like
sucking
on
a
thick
wad
of
liquordrenched
grapefruit
rinds
that
still
have
a
bit
of
flesh
juice
adhered
to
them
the
middle
brings
out
the
malts
they
press
through
in
thin
ribbons
of
caramel
and
prune
deep
from
the
underbelly
of
the
hop
tsunami
thats
so
intense
even
the
roof
of
my
mouth
feels
numbed
mind
you
this
is
entirely
pleasurable
to
me
bigfoot
is
violently
sodomizing
my
mouth
i
look
forward
to
it
every
year
not
much
has
changed
since
the
original
tasting
i
may
reserve
the
rest
for
a
longer
term
testing
to
give
the
hops
a
better
chance
to
mellow
this
may
not
be
the
best
version
of
bigfoot
ive
tried
but
i
still
love
this
beer
wow
this
is
strong
as
hell
pours
a
nice
red
color
with
a
massive
head
that
laces
all
the
way
down
the
glass
smells
of
mega
hops
and
is
very
malty
as
well
it
is
a
little
unbalanced
toward
the
hoppy
side
but
that
is
the
style
tough
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
as
the
alcohol
shines
through
hard
finishes
dry
and
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
but
just
too
much
for
me
its
like
every
beer
youve
ever
had
dumped
into
one
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
very
nice
barleywine
that
id
certainly
get
again
certainly
one
of
the
best
beers
of
this
style
that
ive
had
so
many
try
to
be
pretentiously
strong
or
harsh
but
this
spoton
in
those
regards
still
if
you
want
a
distinctly
american
take
on
the
style
then
youll
like
this
no
harm
in
letting
the
2007
cellar
a
bit
though
it
could
only
help
a
great
fresh
barleywine
love
it
every
year
2007
served
in
a
chalice
pours
a
dark
slightly
cloudy
orange
with
a
short
head
that
mostly
fades
quickly
but
leaves
some
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
a
little
bit
fainter
than
id
like
but
there
is
still
a
wonderful
nose
of
fresh
piney
hops
the
taste
is
amazing
this
beer
is
definitely
best
fresh
and
unaged
an
explosion
of
fresh
and
piney
hops
with
a
backnote
of
grapefruit
and
a
solid
dry
malt
background
there
are
also
notes
of
bitter
orange
and
an
undefinable
meaty
taste
as
well
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
substantial
without
being
grainy
or
sweet
the
hop
levelof
this
barley
wine
keeps
it
dry
and
powerful
flirting
with
dipa
style
perilously
drinkable
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
at
home
brew
very
nice
way
to
end
your
day
this
beer
is
way
too
drinakble
for
9
6
respect
this
brew
and
savor
it
enjoy
i
dont
know
if
my
taste
has
changed
this
much
in
a
year
or
if
it
really
is
that
different
but
i
much
prefer
this
to
the
2006
version
this
is
incredible
cheers
2006
one
year
old
amazingly
different
from
the
new
release
hops
have
faded
away
in
comparison
big
malty
nose
and
mouth
feel
is
must
maltier
than
new
bottle
almost
too
malty
i
think
it
will
be
great
in
another
year
or
two
with
my
personal
taste
ive
had
an
older
vintage
and
remember
it
being
better
i
have
another
one
i
will
sit
on
for
a
while
and
revisit
id
say
this
may
be
much
more
drinkable
in
a
few
months
though
i
must
admit
im
not
very
schooled
on
barleywine
of
the
few
ive
tried
this
seems
to
be
the
most
hoppy
with
a
few
nice
hoppy
burps
to
boot
thckcloying
mouthfeelvery
juicy
dont
want
to
stop
drinking
this
beerbut
the
alcohol
and
thickness
will
catch
up
reminds
me
of
a
dipa
d
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
not
for
me
one
and
done

poured
a
muddy
brown
with
a
white
half
inch

very
well
carbonated
after
4
years

dies
down
to
some
faint

intense
tastetrademark
bigfoot
of
intense
hoppiness
and
with
sweet

in
the
middle
and
a
bit
of
sting
on
the
aftertaste
heavy
body
slowed
down
the
drinkability
remarkably
balanced
for
its
age
this
is
my
last
2003
now
i
wish
i
could
taste
this
next
year
but
it
snowed
last
night
so
what
the
heck
d
this
is
really
good
i
do
prefer
them
aged
though
it
is
almost
like
two
different
beers
both
are
very
good
but
fit
their
certain
moods
very
enjoyable
drinkabilty
is
only
limited
by
high
abv
this
is
from
the
2006
vintage
i
bought
a
year
ago
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
with
a
short
lived
brown
head
and
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
mixture
of
bitter
hops
and
alcohol
fusels
remnds
me
of
a
sweet
brandy
the
taste
matured
from
last
spring
as
the
hops
mellowed
quite
a
bit
but
not
enough
this
was
like
drinking
a
bitter
brandy
way
too
much
alcohol
up
front
along
with
very
cascade
hopsgrapefruit
pine
solvent
bitterness
dominated
the
entire
brew
way
out
of
balance
one
positive
thing
about
to
say
was
the
strong
malt
base
even
though
it
couldnt
quite
keep
up
with
the
hops
a
sweet
toffee
like
taste
could
be
detected
thanks
to
the
near
perfect
carbonation
while
this
is
a
hopheads
dream
i
find
it
a
bit
too
much
if
not
poorly
constructed
if
i
wish
to
drink
grapejuice
soaked
pine
needles
i
go
make
it
myself
perhaps
another
2
years
in
the
cellar
would
have
helped
but
i
doubt
it
the
overpowering
bitterness
is
here
to
stay
not
intended
to
be
a
session
beer
i
prefer
the
english
barley
wines
but
for
hopheads
this
is
your
thing
poured
out
a
reddish
clear
color
not
much
head
but
strangely
lots
of
lacing
the
nose
was
big
lots
of
hops
green
and
bitter
some
alcohol
but
not
as
huge
as
i
thought
it
would
be
the
taste
was
pretty
big
warming
with
sherry
raisin
hops
pine
and
a
tiny
bit
of
alcohol
more
from
the
warmth
of
the
mouthfeel
than
a
particular
taste
a
gentle
giant
had
a
fairly
clean
mouthfeel
medium
effervescence
with
a
long
big
finish
the
bigfoot
ale
takes
a
close
second
to
celebration
ale
when
ranking

brews
the
2006
vintage
poured
to
a
dark
brown
cloudy
liquid
nominal
head
that
did
last
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nice
fine
lacing
the
smell
was
of
hoppy
alcohol
and
fruits
very
nice
taste
was
of
a
great
blend
of
strong
malt
and
hops
strong
alcohol
kicker
as
well
again
very
nice
the
brew
felt
thick
with
little
carbonation
despite
the
heaviness
and
alchohol
content
of
this
beer
i
found
it
extremely
drinkable
another
solid
product
by
sn
pours
a
rather
muddy
orange
color
seemd
almost
flat
when
opened
very
slight
carbonation
level
but
nothing
worth
noticing
when
it
came
to
trying
it
very
spruce
like
aroma
residual
hop
aroma
with
a
deep
resin
laced
slightly
malty
scent
quite
malty
flavor
winey
somewhat
oakiness
to
it
fairly
bitter
but
none
of
the
fresh
hop
bitterness
to
it
that
it
has
when
new
seems
like
the
alcohol
comes
out
as
the
years
go
by
astringentsort
of
dry
mouthfeel
to
it
the
standout
hop
character
and
huge
malt
flavor
has
definately
subsided
the
dryness
an
astringency
knocks
down
the
drinkability
in
my
book
still
quite
enjoyable
after
6
years
having
recently
tried
a
1994
version
i
wouldnt
wait
much
longer
drinkability
this
has
aged
nicely
in
11
months
becoming
a
well
rounded
barleywine
ive
got
five
left
and
i
look
forward
to
seeing
what
the
future
will
bring
excellent
barleywine

brewing
co
have
had
this
many
times
straight
out
the
bottle
while
enjoying
the
natural
world
very
hoppy
with
a
slightly
fruity
taste
dry
feeling
in
the
mouth
likely
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
although
some
complain
about
the
level
of
hops
i
cant
find
anything
wrong
with
this
characteristic
try
it
pours
dark
brown
with
a
great
creamcolored
head
that
retains
very
well
and
laces
all
over
the
glass
smell
and
taste
are
both
very
malty
lots
of
caramel
character
and
though
chocolate
malt
is
not
used
the
combination
of
malts
gives
a
hint
of
it
in
the
smell
and
taste
since
this
is
almost
a
year
old
i
guess
the
hops
have
calmed
down
a
lot
because
i
dont
detect
an
amazing
amount
of
hoppiness
like
others
say
is
present
when
the
beer
hasnt
aged
the
malt
is
king
in
this
beer
dark
grapefruit
aroma
and
taste
is
also
present
very
fullbodied
and
a
very
complex
taste
the
alcohol
content
is
masked
very
well
its
a
strong
beer
and
it
tastes
strong
but
not
of
strong
alcohol
of
strong
malt
this
one
drinks
pretty
easily
you
probably
wont
finish
it
as
fast
as
other
beers
but
youll
be
able
to
drink
a
few
more
of
them
afterwards
especially
if
youre
a
badass
like
me
ive
had
this
bottle
aging
since
late
winter
the
first
sip
tells
me
that
it
still
packs
a
mighty
hop
punch
which
i
dont
mind
at
all
the
taste
is
still
heavy
on
the
bitter
hops
but
i
dont
think
its
unbalanced
at
all
has
a
nice
oily
feel
on
the
tongue
very
different
from
the
last
barley
wine
i
had
which
was
an
english
style
and
much
more
malty
but
this
is
from
the
west
coast
so
what
do
you
expect
i
could
drink
two
or
three
of
these
no
problem
i
have
two
more
im
saving
trying
to
save
for
another
year
or
so
to
see
how
it
ages
a
great
barley
wine
for
the
hop
addicts
of
the
world
drinkability
not
high
marks
here
it
is
hard
to
drink
multiples
of
this
beer
needs
to
smoothe
out
after
some
cellaring
interesting
brew
2006
poured
a
rich
hazy
caramel
color
with
a
thin
head
smell
was
hop
with
a
caramel
coffee
under
it
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
was
much
more
complex
caramel
and
rosted
malts
followed
by
a
very
dry
hoppy
finish
alcohol
was
very
very
well
hidden
superb
taste
and
mouthfell
make
this
very
drinkable
indeed
this
was
my
favorite
barleywine
to
date
thin
feel
alcohol
seemed
to
stop
any
flavors
that
appeared
however
it
was
easier
to
drink
than
first
suspected
in
taste
the
hops
mellow
down
a
bit
and
a
nice
and
conplex
warming
alcohol
and
sweet
malt
due
take
charge
the
hops
arent
about
to
be
showed
up
though
giving
some
solid
pining
through
and
through
and
good
bittering
through
the
middle
and
end
and
finishes
a
little
dry
the
mouth
gets
a
little
thinner
if
i
remember
the
most
recent
one
i
had
much
warmer
smooth
and
kind
of
crisp
even
at
four
years
overall
ages
very
well
warm
and
fuzzy
feelings
around
poured
to
a
hazy
dark
orange
color
with
medium
offwhite
head
that
hung
around
for
most
of
the
drink
and
then
reduced
to
good
lacing
aroma
was
very
pleasant
of
malty
dark
fruit
with
hints
of
the
alcohol
at
the
beginning
flavor
was
a
little
spicier
than
i
expected
in
a
barley
wine
but
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
was
a
nice
addition
to
the
dark
fruit
taste
as
beer
warmed
the
alcohol
continued
to
make
itself
more
known
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
and
blended
nicely
with
the
malty
sweetness
this
all
worked
together
to
leave
a
nice
smooth
warming
finish
and
pleasant
aftertaste
thanks
to
enola
for
sharing
while
watching
the
panthers
beat
the
bucs
on
monday
night
football
i
have
to
say
first
off
that
i
love
bigfoot
its
great
fresh
but
even
better
after
a
year
i
cant
wait
to
see
it
next
year
if
i
manage
to
save
any
it
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
with
a
nice
head
and
light
carbonation
even
after
a
year
there
are
a
lot
of
hops
in
the
nose
as
well
as
hints
of
alcohol
and
rich
malts
taste
is
a
hop
punch
up
front
barely
subdued
after
almost
a
year
in
the
bottle
grapefruit
and
citrus
flavor
mellowing
into
sweet
malt
flavor
nice
rich
raisin
with
hints
of
toffee
i
cant
wait
to
compare
last
years
with
the
next
batch
overall
im
pretty
much
in
love
with
this
stuff
a
staple
during
the
fallwinter
months
great
mouthfeel
not
to
bitter
but
as
mentioned
above
finishes
strong
alcohol
taste
is
present
but
in
a
good
way
pours
out
a
cloudy
amber
brewhas
a
verythick

it

out
by

nice

enough
and
you
know
its
there
but
not
overbearing
mouthfeel

nice
and
thick
a
nice
treat
once
in
a
while
not
an
everyday
brew
2006
version
dark
in
color
aroma
is
almost
equally
hoppy
and
malty
hops
are
the
first
thing
i
noticed
when
drinking
this
only
after
a
few
sips
did
i
start
to
notice
the
toasty
maltiness
this
beer
has
very
complex
flavor
with
some
aspects
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
alcohol
is
hardly
noticeable
in
the
flavor
though
the
alcohols
effects
kind
of
sneak
up
on
you
a
pretty
solid
brew
definitely
my
favorite
sn
so
far
wish
i
could
find
it
in
a
bit
more
places
around
here
it
has
a
very
malty
roasted
smell
to
it
along
with
some
citrus
wow
what
a
combination
this
is
a
great
beer
very
good
for
so
much
alcohol
the
hops
definitely
stand
out
here
this
beer
is
really
thick
on
the
tongue
almost
oily
the
hops
and
malt
taste
linger
in
your
mouth
for
a
long
time
for
a
barley
wine
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
d
ive
said
this
before
no
decent
barleywine
is
very
drinkable
this
one
however
does
go
down
a
bit
easier
than
most
not
sure
if
this
is
a
plus
or
a
minus
but
i
like
the
beer
anyway
not
too
mention
the
beer
gets
points
for
being
one
of
the
few
barleywines
that
dont
start
with
the
word
old
overall
a
very
nice
beer
however
i
think
i
will
prefer
it
more
once
it
has
aged
some
and
the
flavors
blend
better
and
the
alcohol
is
a
little
less
hot
pours
reddish
brown
with
off
white
head
leaving
lacy
on
the
glass
aroma
is
citrusy
hops
carmel
or
toffee
like
malts
and
alcohol
this
beer
is
very
very
bitter
there
is
a
lot
of
malt
here
but
it
is
overwhelmed
by
the
bitterness
leaves
a
signifcant
alcohol
burn
on
my
throat
this
definately
needs
to
sit
a
few
years
and
it
will
probably
be
better
it
seems
like
the
bitterness
may
be
masking
malt
complexity
i
have
some
04
and
05
i
think
ill
try
those
soon
and
compare
dsolid
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
and
am
letting
them
age
in
my
cellar
i
will
going
to
try
to
drink
one
every
year
for
the
next
5
years
a
very
solid
buy
i
bought
at
a
bar
and
poured
myself
into
a
glass
it
had
good
head
that
subsided
not
fast
but
not
slow
either
the
smell
wasnt
overpowering
yet
i
could
smell
it
as
soon
as
i
was
served
the
taste
was
execlent
i
dont
even
know
where
to
begin
explaining
the
flavor
it
was
just
great
dont
drink
and
review
this
is
a
damn
fine
barley
wine
and
one
tha
ages
niceley
this
review
is
based
between
an
05
and
06
side
by
side
but
i
must
say
that
the
05s
hops
are
a
little
more
subdued
and
the
caramel
flavor
pushes
forward
with
a
bit
of
a
toffee
touch
i
like
it
taste
is
quite
hoppy
of
course
the
hops
really
hits
you
hard
then
followed
by
malt
and
a
shy
toffee
flavour
5ive
conqured
the
bigfoot
ive
got
my
balls
now
im
gonna
go
out
and
get
a
6
pack
of
this
stuff
for
next
year
great
hoppy
beer
that
pushes
the
bounderies
but
still
makes
drinking
easy
where
is
2008
already
drinkability
the
alcohol
makes
itself
wellknown
in
this
one
makes
itself
a
bit
more
of
a
sipping
beer
than
other
barleywines
ill
definately
put
some
down
for
the
coming
years
as
i
know
last
years
aged
very
nicely
drinkability
really
makes
you
want
to
keep
sipping
all
night
long
but
the
abv
will
catch
up
to
you
quickly
almost
too
drinkable
for
such
a
high
gravity
brew
i
hear
this
one
improves
with
age
ill
never
know
i
am
not
a
big
hop
head
but
here
goes
12oz
stubby
brown
bottle
with
2006
on
the
cap
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
2
finger
head
good
longevity
and
very
good
lace
good
malt
aromas
mixed
with
a
spicy
citrus
hop
aroma
hops
predominate
the
flavor
but
there
is
a
definate
solid
malt
base
massive
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
somewhat
buttery
mouthfeel
i
recall
that
when
i
first
bought
this
sixer
earlier
this
year
it
was
really
harsh
it
has
mellowed
quite
a
bit
since
then
and
i
am
sure
will
continur
to
do
so
if
you
are
a
hop
head
than
this
is
your
beer
alcohol
is
noticeable
and
will
bite
you
if
not
careful
a
good
beer
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
slainte
appearance
was
a
deep
cloudy
orangeamber
color
and
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
left
a
nice
lace
aroma
was
heavy
in
the
roasted
caramel
department
with
fruitiness
and
hops
taste
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
expected
something
ultra
smooth
with
moderate
bitterness
but
what
i
got
was
a
smack
of
hops
a
tongue
sizzling
bitterness
with
alcohol
and
then
a
smooth
roasted
caramel
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
chewy
overall
an
excellent
barley
wine
but
not
on
the
level
of
stone
og
in
my
opinion
this
one
is
very
consistent
i
have
had
this
about
3
years
in
a
row
now
and
i
have
liked
it
the
same
every
time
it
is
beautifully
fruity
and
strong
under
the
nose
as
well
as
the
tongue
hopshops
and
more
hops
bitter
as
all
hell
just
the
way
i
like
it
i
hunt
this
one
down
when
it
starts
getting
cold
outside
i
love
it
around
the
holidays
nice
and
warm
an
all
out
favorite
2006
is
great
i
enjoyed
having
one
but
had
no
desire
for
a
second
moouthfeel
is
smooth
and
nice
drikability
is
reasonable
although
soupy
sweetness
is
only
so
drinkable
a
bit
too
sharp
to
drink
more
than
one
at
this
point
will
keep
the
rest
of
the
sixpack
for
a
while
to
see
how
it
changes
with
time
just
couldnt
resist
trying
one
right
away
ive
had
this
sitting
around
since
the
beginning
of
the
year
pours
a
clear
amber
color
nice
carbonation
tiny
head
though
and
some
nice
lacing
afterwards
a
nice
hoppymalty
scent
with
some
citrus
thrown
in
the
taste
is
awesome
hoppy
but
mild
sweet
malts
and
a
nice
tangy
taste
nice
little
bite
finish
also
a
nice
warming
effect
in
the
throat
medium
body
a
nice
complex
brew
very
drinkable
an
awesome
brew
d
kind
of
a
cross
between
a
real
barleywine
and
an
ipa
leans
toward
the
hops
a
bit
much
for
me
but
still
very
well
done
one
of
my
favorite
barleywine
style
ales
they
loaded
this
thing
with
tons
of
bitter
hop
character
and
a
very
nice
grainycooked
malt
flavor
that
helps
to
sooth
your
mouth
in
the
finish
and
aftertast
highly
recommended
d
too
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
id
session
itif
i
were
still
in
my
early
twenties
not
as
complex
as
i
would
have
expected
but
nice
some
aging
has
left
the
booziness
of
this
beer
settle
i
was
a
lenient
reviewer
much
more
than
i
am
now
the
only
thing
that
ups
is
the
mouthfeel
from
a
3
to
a
4
2006
edition
bought
in
july
of
06
drinkability
i
like
this
enough
to
have
it
occasionally
but
overall
its
not
as
good
as
other
barleywines
english
or
american
style
adam
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
that
is
much
darker
when
it
is
tipped
on
its
side
the
smell
is
delicious
much
like
hops
but
with
a
hint
of
malts
and
apparent
carbonation
the
taste
is
big
but
really
well
balanced
the
initial
taste
is
of
hops
but
right
after
it
starts
to
develop
with
the
malts
kicking
in
and
evening
it
out
to
a
nonobtrusive
taste
in
addition
to
the
tasty
hops
there
is
also
a
hint
of
spices
that
make
it
go
down
much
easier
really
a
good
beer
and
definitely
something
to
seek
out
2004
sample
this
is
a
super
fine
hoppy
barleywine
very
enjoyable
still
young
the
beer
is
very
hot
and
extremely
hoppy
balance
is
not
part
of
the
equation
and
although
one
can
easily
detect
the
malt
body
of
the
beer
it
is
overshadowed
by
the
hop
character
not
a
bad
beer
fresh
but
i
suspect
some
time
in
the
cellar
will
increase
drinkability
a
great
deal
wow
very
hoppy
brew
that
will
startstop
a
conversation
at

event
any
beer
lover
must
try
poured

drink

9
alc
makes
it
tough
to
put
down
the
usual
intake
notes
i
drank
this
one
on
its
own
to
get
all
of
the
characteristics
down
that
was
a
mistake
on
my
part
i
think
this
beer
would
be
better
paired
with
some
big
spicy
dishes
with
the
right
pairing
this
beer
could
be
great

is
the
operative

poured
from
the
bottle
nice
reddish
tint
deep
in
color
gave
a
good
head
which
at
times
just
kept
coming
and
coming
until
it
flowed
over
the
glass

had
excellent
retention
and
lacing

was
very
strong

some

some

taste
equally
strong
and
diverse

heavy
almost
syrupy
but
not
too
much
very
drinkable
but
take
your
time
and
enjoy
it
not
to
be
drunk
too
quickly
that
is
for
sure
it
was
the
hands
down
winner
over
the
esteemed
st
bernardus
that
night
though
this
is
a
strong
beer
i
would
say
its
drinkability
is
fairly
high
at
least
for
people
with
the
taste
for
big
beers
poured
the
darkest
brown
imaginable
with
tints
of
amber
nice
half
finger
head
despite
it
being
over
4
years
old
even
with
the
age
the
hop
aroma
leapt
from
the
bottle
like
a
caged
tiger
lowering
my
nose
to
the
glass
i
can
smell
syrupy
caramel
meek
cherry
sweet
grapefruit
and
pine
in
the
taste
dept
the
caramel
syrup
and
bare
chocolate
take
center
stage
but
are
definitely
competing
with
powerful
hoppy
pine
and
grapefruit
finish
is
pleasingly
bitter
the
age
has
really
smoothed
this
one
out
im
glad
because
i
really
like
the
malt
on
this
one
mouth
is
as
thick
and
chewy
as
ever
im
glad
to
know
i
can
get
bigfoot
this
old
almost
whenever
i
want
in
all
likelihood
ill
want
it
all
the
time
taste
the
bitterness
over
comes
the
sweet
in
the
end
but
right
as
it
hits
the
tounge
there
is
an
immidiate
sweetness
alcohol
is
present
in
the
after
taste
took
this
out
of
my
cellar
for
a
treat
was
still
as
bitter
as
i
remembered
pretty
strong
stuff
but
tasty
1995
bottle

none

one
of

nights

english
style
barley
wine
though
much
rougher
in
nature
no
matter
the
age
much
more
emphasis
on
hops
rather
than
maltyeast
deep
woody
taste
could
have
been
the
age
have
had
preety
much
every
year
since
massive
dry
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
also
heavy
in
hop
bitterness
it
does
boast
a
good
amount
of
rich
sweet
maltiness
raw
brutal
and
so
damn
intriguingsatisfying
on
to
the
06s
drinkability
call
me
a
wuss
but
i
think
these
american
barleywines
are
brutal
angry
beers
one
is
more
than
enough
drinkabilityoverall
definitely
a
hopped
up
sierra
nevadaed
barleywine
would
have
like
to
see
more
toffeemalt
development
in
the
midpalate
but
still
an
american
classic
isnt
quite
as
drinkable
as
some
others
in
the
style
however
drinkability
this
will
win
over
fans
of
more
hoppy
american
barleywines
not
my
favorite
and
a
little
harsh
to
drink
a
lot
of
however
this
is
exactly
what
youd
expect
a
sierra
nevada
barleywine
to
taste
like
and
i
can
appreciate
their
take
on
the
style
i
feel
like
it
doesnt
achieve
the
balance
of
other
sn
beers
and
doesnt
have
quite
enough
of
the
deep
malt
development
that
i
find
so
appealing
in
other
barleywines
pours
a
rich
redish
brown
with
a
head
that
slowly
develops
bits
of
lacing
on
the
glass
hardly
any
carbonation
showing
the
smell
is
very
inviting
sweet
with
traces
of
fruits
heavy
alcohol
some
hops
and
malt
the
taste
is
strong
with
almost
a
pine
taste
with
a
heavy
dose
of
bitter
the
finish
is
long
with
bitter
and
some
of
the
fruit
notes
showing
through
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
rough
medium
body
no
carbonation
lots
of
alcohol
which
is
expected
i
have
been
checking
out
different
barley
wines
but
didnt
like
this
one
as
much
as
others
i
have
had
i
love
sierra
nevada
brews
but
i
would
check
out
other
selections
by
them
unless
you
are
a
huge
barley
wine
fan
cheers
d
if
you
like
barleywines
you
should
really
like
this
one
if
thats
the
case
youll
find
this
absolutely
drinkable
flat
oxidized
ancient
10
years
out
very
rich
sherry
notes
earthy
coffee
deep
everything
about
this
beer
screams
old
very
long
finish
syrupy
and
lingering
jw
lees
comes
to
mind
still
ok
nearly
great
im
lucky
to
try
it
d
this
beer
is
young
it
would
be
best
to
sit
on
for
atlest
two
years
but
its
still
darn
good
at
an
early
age
as
well
one
of
the
best
barleywines
in
the
world
and
thats
saying
a
lot
d
overall
a
very
good
beer
possibly
my
favorite
sierra
nevada
i
havent
had
an
aged
bottle
but
ill
bet
as
this
one
ages
it
mellows
nicely
if
i
can
stand
it
ill
hang
on
to
one
of
the
last
two
2006
bottles
and
drink
them
in
a
year
or
two
i
poured
this
ale
into
a
glass
and
several
things
are
immediately
apparent
first
the
aromatic
smell
knocks
you
out
i
dunno
strawberrys
cherrys
hops
honey
there
is
a
sweet
sugary
wine
smell
that
is
blessed
second
the
head
lingers
and
lingers
there
is
great
lacing
but
the
head
just
hangs
there
and
the
color
of
the
head
is
a
rich
coffeecream
color
with
a
swirl
of
ruby
red
in
it
i
swear
it
is
beautiful
in
the
glass
you
like
hops
you
like
kickass
hops
it
would
be
impossible
to
impregnate
this
brew
with
any
more
hops
the
bite
grabs
your
buds
and
tonsils
and
tears
at
them
but
it
leaves
the
palette
clean
and
clear
whoa
alc
9
6
means
only
one
or
two
at
a
time
but
this
stuff
is
so
overwhelming
one
or
two
will
more
than
suffice
thanks
sierra
nevada
generally
i
am
not
a
fan
of
very
hoppy
bitter
beer
i
have
been
expanding
my
palette
and
am
much
more
pleased
with
a
bitterhop
beer
it
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
with
the
high
alcohol
content
and
intense
bitterness
this
is
very
enjoyable
but
one
is
enough
for
the
day
edit
after
writing
this
i
found
out
what
had
happened
with
that
miner
and
bigfoot
under
the
bottle
cap
there
is
a
picture
and
it
appears
that
bigfoot
sat
down
with
the
miner
and
a
friend
in
front
of
a
campfire
and
drinking
a
couple
of
these
beers
i
guess
the
bigfoot
didnt
rip
the
miner
limb
from
limb
it
didnt
show
the
donkey
but
im
sure
the
bigfoot
didnt
eat
him
2005
vintage
pours
brown
with
a
little
dark
copper
and
red
and
an
off
white
head
bottle
conditioned
cloudiness
smells
rich
and
sweet
prunes
and
apricots
malty
some
dry
red
wine
and
alcohol
the
sweet
maltiness
hits
the
palate
for
a
brief
moment
before
the
harsh
but
pleasant
peppery
and
piney
hop
bitterness
kicks
in
a
nice
large
dry
alcohol
finish
chose
the
05
to
review
as
i
thought
it
would
be
truer
to
the
beers
nature
but
definitely
enjoy
it
more
after
approx
five
as
the
hops
mellow
and
let
the
flavors
establish
themselves
better
an
over
the
top
american
barleywinemalty
dipa
this
one
breaks
some
style
barriers
a
classic
i
really
liked
this
beer
very
much
and
gave
it
solid
4s
across
the
board
i
always
enjoy
sierra
nevadas
work
and
im
looking
forward
to
giving
this
another
try
soon
overall
impressive
beer
that
ages
well
and
changes
drastically
although
not
necessarily
for
the
worse
over
time
i
am
pleased
by
all
three
vintages
and
curious
to
try
others
peak
seems
to
be
sometime
before
the
beer
hits
three
years
like
i
said
earlier
its
a
work
in
progress
ive
had
better
barleywines
and
some
worse
i
look
forward
to
revisiting
this
in
a
year
or
two
pours
darkish
caramel
brown
translucent
rather
carbonated
but
not
a
lot
of
head
not
much
lacing
nose
is
filled
with
dried
fruits
light
florals
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
smells
a
bit
strong
taste
is
also
a
bit
strong
of
course
its
a
barleywine
but
the
balance
is
not
quite
there
strength
of
alcohol
is
rather
evident
quite
raisiny
as
well
would
have
liked
something
else
to
balance
it
out
and
make
it
more
full
though
maybe
i
needed
to
let
it
sit
longer
not
sure
a
big
fan
of
barleywines
but
this
one
is
low
on
my
list
d
despite
alcohol
content
and
rich
full
body
this
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
and
i
could
easily
knock
back
a
couple
of
these
far
more
drinkable
and
wellbalanced
than
a
lot
of
the
syrupy
double
ipas
one
finds
on
the
shelves
these
days
2006
version
is
very
similar
to
most
other
years
i
have
enjoyed
d
very
good
beer
couldnt
do
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
really
warms
you
up
good
2006
edition
is
even
good
this
new
that
distinctive
sierra
nevada
aroma
drifts
out
the
glass
but
this
one
really
has
a
strong
malt
backbone
nice
clouded
amber
appearance
carries
balance
strength
of
this
beer
while
allowing
for
that
signature
sierra
nevada
hop
flavor
to
glide
out
in
the
end
scary
how
easy
this
is
to
drink
and
would
be
a
great
beer
to
lay
down
for
a
while
some
people
cant
tell
the
difference
between
coke
and
pepsi
but
this
beautiful
beer
certainly
is
a
brandmarker
paid
1
69
for
a
bottle
lovely
auburnchestnut
color
with
nice
tan
head
smell
is
divine
heavy
on
the
florals
and
alphas
but
a
good
malt
presence
in
the
nose
excellent
taste
up
front
heavy
malt
sweetness
with
good
hop
bitters
and
the
lovely
scents
just
overloading
your
brain
nice
alcohol
heat
too
maybe
a
bit
too
much
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
soft
bubble
with
a
bit
too
much
stickyness
phenomenal
beer
thank
you
sierra
nevada
probably
a
little
raw
and
its
hard
to
break
down
the
subcategories
but
it
just
works
all
together
im
not
doing
to
get
into
the
dipabarleywine
argument
because
i
dont
give
a
damn
either
way
its
a
great
beer
if
you
dont
want
the
kick
in
the
teeth
hops
in
your
barleywine
try
something
else
i
like
it
though
and
this
is
perfect
cloudy
but
vibrant
dark
amberishcopper
with
a
small
light
tan
creamy
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
a
tenacious
thick
film
some
light
lacing
the
smell
is
of
heavenly
pungent
citrus
and
pine
balanced
by
a
solid
caramel
malt
presence
orange
grapefruit
molasses
cookie
raisin
and
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
of
pretty
wickedly
strong
hops
good
flavors
but
the
hops
are
so
strong
they
overpower
some
of
the
better
more
subtle
qualities
of
the
otherwise
very
good
malt
backbone
the
finish
is
very
bitter
and
long
with
plenty
of
lingering
warm
alcohol
it
has
a
medium
body
slightly
chewy
texture
and
has
moderatelively
carbonation
this
is
a
flavor
explosion
and
a
must
try
but
i
agree
with
the
general
consensus
here
that
this
is
a
great
candidate
for
cellaring
maybe
a
year
will
smooth
it
out
enough
to
make
it
the
exceptional
beer
i
was
expecting
nice
night
cap
enjoy
in
bed
with
a
good
book
or
a
good
woman
d
excellent
drinkability
one
or
two
at
a
time
a
treat
for
sure
i
really
liked
the
2005
bigfoot
i
think
this
one
is
incredible
i
think
it
is
more
a
result
of
the
evolution
of
my
pallette
than
any
difference
in
the
beer
woah
bigfoot
pours
a
dark
brown
minimal
carbonation
results
as
this
beast
simmers
down
smell
is
of
alcohol
and
grapefruit
style
hops
taste
is
thick
warm
and
coated
with
explosive
hop
flavor
but
its
a
rash
bitterness
that
isnt
that
well
balanced
alcohol
is
still
there
in
burning
sensation
and
at
times
this
beer
was
tough
to
coax
down
unlike
other
barleywines
this
one
is
sort
of
onedimensional
a
sipper
beer
that
will
knock
you
out
if
not
careful
overall
its
not
bad
but
as
stated
before
onedimensional
and
im
not
sure
if
ill
get
it
again
to
me
this
seemed
more
onedimensional
than
a
lot
of
the
bitterer
beers
ive
tried
perhaps
it
would
improve
with
aging
though
i
have
another
bottle
so
i
will
test
this
theory
joey
this
one
is
just
for
the
hopheads
i
drank
it
at
55
degrees
or
so
if
you
arent
a
hophead
maybe
chill
it
a
little
more
to
subdue
the
flavor
some
really
nasty
metallic
off
flavors
came
out
as
i
drank
it
my
score
would
have
been
much
lower
had
i
not
been
rating
within
the
style
the
nose
is
exceptional
with
a
dense
head
of
hops
brown
sugar
and
a
tang
of
citrus
the
mouthfeel
is
so
rich
and
nearly
coats
your
mouth
upon
the
first
sip
there
are
layers
of
flavor
along
with
the
alcohol
and
a
slight
bitter
sweet
taste
a
bit
floral
hoppy
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
it
is
easily
seen
how
this
could
improve
with
age
and
i
would
love
to
try
another
one
from
this
year
a
bit
down
the
road
too
bad
i
dont
have
the
paitence
clear
chestnutcaramel
colour
with
a
reddish
tan
head
composed
of
fine
bubbles
the
head
was
poured
thin
but
it
was
dense
and
resilient
producing
a
solid
layer
of
lacing
retention
was
superb
throughout
a
balanced
trifecta
of
caramel
pine
and
citrus
greeted
my
nose
with
more
orange
than
grapefruit
character
strong
bitterness
with
a
malty
caramel
sweetness
pine
and
orange
hops
to
start
with
grapefruit
appearing
by
the
end
the
malt
stayed
solid
throughout
and
a
light
fruitiness
appeared
as
it
warmed
bitterness
lingered
moderate
carbonation
with
a
full
body
and
creamy
texture
there
was
a
bit
of
warmth
in
the
finish
as
well
this
is
sinful
on
tap
the
malt
and
hop
combination
is
classic
plus
it
seems
to
have
smoothed
out
nicely
with
a
little
age
what
a
treat
d
very
hard
to
drink
at
first
but
after
i
got
used
to
it
i
liked
it
a
lot
something
id
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
but
i
will
definatly
buy
this
again
i
have
since
purchased
2
cases
to
age
it
i
hear
that
it
ages
very
well
and
mellows
with
age
i
hope
its
lasts
long
enough
for
me
to
enjoy
the
improvement
full
body
full
of
flavor
and
full
of
alcohol
to
me
it
just
doesnt
get
any
better
year
after
year
as
a
major
consumer
of
this
barleywine
i
cant
recommend
it
enough
may
you
get
stomped
by
a
bigfoot
cheers
thanks
to
metalmonk
for
trade
after
the
initial
shock
and
awe
of
the
hops
it
is
very
easy
to
continue
you
really
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
a
hoppy
beer
to
want
more
than
one
tonight
is
not
that
night
but
i
have
5
more
to
enjoy
later
on
i
will
definately
save
one
for
next
year
to
see
how
it
mellows
delicious
but
huge
in
both
flavor
and
abv
high
drinkability
if
savoring
a
single
glass
respectfully
final
thought
packs
a
punch
and
is
equally
blended
there
is
not
much
more
one
can
do
to
make
a
finer
barley
wine
this
is
the
new
standard
in
my
book
and
sierra
nevada
is
the
best
largescale
microbrew
in
this
country
chico
ca
has
some
magic
d
although
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
a
bit
you
certainly
dont
taste
9
60
worth
if
you
take
that
into
account
along
with
the
smoothness
and
the
fact
that
its
not
too
filling
i
could
go
with
this
beer
for
quite
a
while
until
the
abv
catches
up
with
me
this
is
far
from
a
session
beer
but
does
remain
a
favorite
of
mine
as
it
was
one
of
the
first
barleywines
i
tried
a
few
years
back
another
quality
ale
from
sierra
nevada
highly
recommend
im
digging
this
one
id
like
to
sit
on
my
other
bottles
for
anther
year
to
see
what
the
hops
do
but
over
all
this
is
a
pretty
good
hoppy
barley
wine
taste
hits
with
a
blast
of
caramel
malt
multigrain
bread
and
a
dry
sherry
character
the
hops
are
mostly
gone
only
a
decayed
corpse
remains
mouthfeel
is
full
though
not
as
thick
as
a
fresh
one
this
beer
has
gone
from
super
hoppy
to
malty
smooth
i
have
no
desire
to
touch
my
05s
06s
are
still
good
for
a
hop
fix
this
is
very
close
to
peak
imo
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
strong
but
flavourful
sip
it
till
its
gone
sharp
piney
earthy
woody
in
the
quaff
tad
harsh
with
phenolics
and
medicinal
taste
very
oily
and
dry
bitter
finish

needs
another
year
cellaring
to
smooth
out
a
great
beer
all
around
definitely
my
favorite
barleywine
ill
certainly
be
going
on
a
couple
more
2006
expeditions
before
they
disappear
the
2006
tasted
like
nailpolish
remover
after
this
and
looked
about
three
shades
lighter
this
beer
went
great
with
a
little
cheese
platter
i
laid
out
the
plate
consisted
of
aged
irish
porter
cheddar
and
pepperoni
for
spiciness
that
really
accentuate
the
spices
in
the
barleywine
this
brew
is
something
special
it
is
big
but
balanced
very
nice
slàinte
very
good
if
you
like
your
beers
super
hopped
but
even
if
its
easy
to
love
its
hard
to
drink
impressive
but
not
something
you
can
really
drink
regularly
im
not
a
big
fan
of
barley
wines
but
i
tried
to
drink
this
one
objectively
and
compare
it
with
other
barley
wines
from
that
perspective
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
i
do
like
it
but
im
not
too
fond
of
the
lingering
aftertaste
this
would
probably
be
consumed
best
with
a
sharp
cheese
or
red
meat
to
help
balance
its
potency
2006
vintage
oh
and
i
love
the
cartoon
under
the
cap
cheers2beers
overall
quite
tasty
ive
had
both
the
2004
and
2005
a
few
times
and
its
quite
enjoyable
definitely
recommended
this
is
not
something
to
be
consumed
at
a
fast
pace
the
novice
drinker
may
not
adjust
to
this
easily
but
a
good
craft
beer
enthusiast
can
enjoy
this
and
its
nuances
for
quite
a
long
while
it
has
a
wonderful
warming
effect
has
the
bubbly
mouthfeel
and
cascade
hops
that
one
expects
from
a
sn
offering
and
a
subtle
hop
undertone
to
the
aftertaste
a
commendable
effort
one
worth
cellaring
and
certainly
worth
a
try
for
those
willing
to
expand
their
horizons
with
regards
to
styles
and
types
of
beer
consumed
this
is
a
beer
that
should
be
enjoyed
slowly
and
savored
especially
with
the
high
alcohol
content
im
suprised
that
they
sell
it
in
six
packs
very
good
another
addendum
2009
the
2009
release
is
the
best
freshbigfoot
ive
had
yet
this
remains
one
of
the
most
delicious
drinkable
big
beers
of
alltime
a
classic
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
nearly
downed
the
last
of
my
2nd
sixer
before
realizing
i
hadnt
taken
any
notes
on
it
yet
an
everyday
big
beer
if
there
ever
was
one
the
most
quaffable
of
the
three
i
tried
for
a
vertical
but
aging
the
bottles
for
a
few
years
is
the
ideal
way
to
enjoy
all
this
beer
can
do
imo
this
is
definitly
a
fine
brew
for
a
hop
head
like
myself
if
you
dont
like
the
taste
of
hops
or
any
ipa
this
is
not
a
brew
for
you
ive
only
had
a
few
barleywines
so
far
but
this
is
by
far
the
hoppiest
ive
had
of
the
style
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
one
would
taste
in
about
a
year
2009
deep
amber
big
pine
hop
over
a
boozy
caramel
malt
body
full
body
not
overly
heavy
caramel
malt
that
manages
not
to
be
overly
sweet
huge
piney
hop
palate
with
a
modhigh
bitterness
gonna
leave
my
scores
as
they
are
single
from
total
wine
newport
news
va
stuck
one
in
the
cellar
for
the
vertical
not
sure
if
i
can
finish
the
one
ive
got
much
less
the
one
in
the
fridge
i
really
think
its
just
me
i
dont
think
this
is
bad
for
the
style
or
anything
like
that
its
just
too
much
for
me
maybe
its
better
aged
ill
be
in
no
hurry
to
drink
the
next
one
and
see
what
happens
in
six
months
or
so

poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
a
redish
brown
color
huge
white
fluffy
head
with
lacing
hop
smell
hits
me
instantly
and
i
think
of
the
celebration
ale
citrus
and
pine
smells
i
could
enjoy
all
day
long
very
smooth
initial
taste
followed
by
bitter
hop
adn
then
a
high
alcohol
finish
this
is
one
powerful
beer
wish
i
would
have
purchased
more
to
let
age
drinkable
eh
given
the
booze
and
the
unabashed
heaviness
its
ok
i
certainly
cant
do
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
let
alone
one
sitting
a
nice
experience
for
my
first
barleywine
but
not
something
i
would
seek
to
pay
for
again
got
me
pretty
ripped
though
i
could
only
have
one
bigfoot
a
day
have
some
in
my
cellar
to
try
in
a
year
or
so
and
i
will
review
again
then
d
its
not
everyday
that
i
can
drink
a
beer
like
this
but
this
is
definitely
the
best
barleywine
that
ive
had
so
far
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
prominent
right
now
in
a
few
years
i
think
this
will
be
truly
great
i
doubt
this
beer
would
make
a
great
session
beer
it
is
high
in
alcohol
and
the
aggressive
flavor
would
wear
thin
soon
enjoy
full
body
moderate
carbonation
this
beers
balance
and
relatively
low
alcohol
content
make
it
surprisingly
drinkable
albeit
at
a
sipping
pace
id
like
to
sit
on
a
few
of
these
for
a
couple
years
and
see
how
they
turn
out
da
medium
as
tasty
and
commendable
as
this
classic
barleywine
is
i
never
have
more
the
2
or
3
servings
vigorous
pour
yields
a
2
inch
head
that
doesnt
hang
around
and
leaves
slight
lace
a
deep
coppery
red
with
only
slight
haze
aroma
instantly
noticeable
alcohol
some
piney
citrus
and
doughy
caramel
taste
intensly
sweet
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
very
intense
at
first
the
hops
and
malt
compete
briefly
fighting
for
your
attention
citrus
and
caramel
then
two
sides
of
the
flavor
equation
hops
vs
maltseem
to
cancel
each
other
so
that
alcohol
asserts
itself
over
the
two
leaving
a
biitersweet
aftertaste
following
an
alcohol
burn
mouthfeel
very
full
mouth
little
carbonation
slick
coating
and
small
alcohol
burn
drinkability
this
is
very
good
but
very
rich
could
handle
two
in
one
sitting
maybe
three
if
i
wasnt
driving
then
would
need
to
have
something
much
less
rich
and
smaller
abv
as
for
the
alcohol
burn
this
ale
is
good
enough
as
to
make
it
tolerable
moreover
i
suspect
that
the
burn
diminishes
with
age
cellering
as
the
ales
components
mellow
and
hence
integrate
with
each
other
rather
than
compete
much
the
same
way
it
does
with
wine
this
being
my
first
barleywine
experience
this
is
vintage
2006
absolute
hop
blast
in
the
mouth
very
earthy
with
flavors
of
wood
and
leather
but
piney
hops
flex
and
push
everything
else
into
the
background
alcohol
is
faint
and
quite
pleasant
i
had
the
pleasure
to
drink
this
side
by
side
a
750ml
bottle
of
old
crustacean
with
a
friend
of
course
and
was
able
to
appreciate
the
big
difference
mainly
the
sweet
balanced
flavor
of
rogues
vs
the
hop
bomb
of
bigfoot
this
is
an
amazing
digestif
beer
ive
been
able
to
enjoy
on
many
a
night
holds
a
special
place
for
me
this
was
a
beer
of
extremes
for
me
there
were
parts
i
really
liked
and
parts
that
really
ruined
it
for
me
i
could
not
finish
it
i
have
one
more
bottle
that
i
will
let
age
for
a
year
or
two
and
see
what
its
like
i
am
a
big
sierra
nevada
fan
and
i
could
not
do
this
one
i
will
get
this
again
but
i
can
tell
that
my
girlfriend
who
likes
her
hops
subtle
will
have
to
leave
the
room
when
i
drink
this
mmm
i
wont
have
to
share
poured
into
the
pint
glass
with
a
very
red
orange
appearance
head
is
white
with
little
retention
little
visible
carbonation
nose
is
big
time
hops
upfront
lurking
behind
however
is
a
pretty
robust
sweet
malt
backbone
to
offset
the
hop
attack
just
a
tad
smells
wonderful
palate
is
as
suspected
the
hops
jump
out
and
grab
you
like
a
pissed
off
yeti
as
the
nose
indicated
the
substantial
malt
character
really
does
work
to
tame
the
massive
hop
profile
this
one
contains
pine
green
tea
and
a
little
citrus
mixed
with
sweet
mollasses
and
caramel
mouthfeel
is
biting
and
sweet
again
low
carbonation
lasting
bitterness
of
the
hops
coexist
with
a
persistent
sweetness
mediumbodied
wow
what
can
i
say
ive
wanted
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
now
and
it
didnt
disappoint
i
was
a
bit
worried
as
this
is
the
06
bigfoot
and
still
very
young
the
hops
are
indeed
untamed
and
are
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
all
in
all
though
this
is
still
very
drinkable
one
and
promises
even
better
things
in
a
couple
of
years
the
rest
of
the
six
is
goin
in
the
cellar
and
wont
make
another
appearance
for
a
year
at
least
by
then
itll
have
learned
a
little
discipline
anyway
as
for
the
bigfoot
i
believe
what
a
great
brew
from
sn
hoppy
malty
and
full
of
alcohol
but
still
well
balanced
and
delicious

i
bought
a

and
a

is

cellared
as
we
speak
a
beer
that
gains
in
flavor
and
robustness
as
it
ages
and
im
sure
it
will
be
a
hoot
this
is
an
excellent
product
once
again
from
sierra

this
is
my
personal
favorite
beer
not
really
overpowering
in
any
area
sure
its
a
litle
strong
but
nice
those
citrus
hops
again
a
bit
of
bite

there
is
no

on
which
side
the
balance
lies
in
this

lots

i
cant

drinking
more
than
2
of
these
in
one
sitting
without
getting
tipsy
or
numbing
your
buds
with
that
said
and
a
little

i
know
this
one
is
supposed
to
age
well
pours
a
deep
caramel
color
with
a
quarter
inch
tan
head
leaving
very
good
lacing
smell
has
a
presence
of
caramel
and
malty
tones
as
well
as
a
strong
hop
presence
hops
leaving
a
piney
aroma
taste
begins
with
dark
fruit
and
maltiness
then
the
hops
kick
in
with
a
taste
of
pine
also
has
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
warming
in
the
end
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
slick
nice
carbonation
as
far
as
drinkability
is
concerned
its
very
tastey
however
be
careful
as
it
packs
a
wallop
opinion
i
really
like
this
beer
for
the
most
part
but
this
particular
year
is
definitely
balanced
way
more
toward
the
bitter
than
i
have
noticed
in
previous
years
there
is
much
more
hop
presence
to
this
beer
and
at
this
point
it
is
a
bit
harsh
so
i
almost
think
that
they
changed
the
profile
of
their
liquor
this
is
still
good
and
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
it
turns
out
in
a
couple
years
it
was
dark
amber
almost
brown
with
a
very
small
but
thick
head
it
had
a
wonderful
aroma
to
it
i
couldnt
help
to
take
a
big
whiff
and
enjoy
just
the
smell
first
definitely
some
citrus
notes
but
not
too
strong
the
taste
didnt
disappoint
either
the
alcohol
bite
hit
first
then
hops
punch
with
the
spices
all
at
once
i
enjoyed
the
alcohol
bite
but
my
roommate
wished
he
went
with
the
02
they
had
which
we
were
told
had
a
slightly
smoother
taste
definitely
a
thick
mouth
coating
beer
and
as
my
bartender
mentioned
it
is
a
gentleman
sipping
beer
and
got
better
as
the
pint
warmed
i
might
have
to
go
back
tonight
to
try
the
02
i
coul
dhave
this
again
but
ive
had
better
the
first
taste
did
not
dissapoint
rich
and
hoppy
i
sipped
slowly
it
only
improved
as
it
warmed
i
managed
to
make
the
pint
last
close
to
an
hour
rounded
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
with
ample
bitterness
this
is
a
very
quaffable
brew
this
was
a
2005
vintage
bottle
poured
a
dark
amber
colour
with
very
little
head
aroma
was
mild
but
smelled
of
ripe
fruit
and
sweet
malts
higher
alcohol
was
detectable
in
the
nose
the
flavour
started
sweet
with
fruit
flavours
and
dark
chocolate
malts
but
it
finished
very
dry
and
bitter
a
nice
warming
affect
was
also
provide
by
the
high
abv
i
think
this
beer
would
definitely
age
really
well
but
was
certainly
drinkable
now
i
may
have
to
purchase
more
to
cellar
and
compare
to
next
years
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
slick
wet
very
wet
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
in
here
sneaky
very
sneaky
a
tasty
thing
that
will
knock
you
on
your
bum
if
you
dont
keep
track
of
how
many
youve
had
this
beer
is
fully
loaded
with
agenerous
malt
profile
and
even
more
generous
hop
addition
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
doesnt
detract
despite
its
impressive
percentage
ill
check
back
after
i
cellar
the
rest
of
this
six
pack
i
could
see
the
bitterness
dropping
a
little
which
would
make
the
malt
shine
even
more
and
achieve
a
better
balance
however
unaged
this
is
still
a
tasty
brew
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
helps
this
beer
drain
from
the
glass
rapidly
this
is
a
full
bodied
barley
wine
has
a
very
nice
warming
alcohol
kick
i
tried
it
again
and
i
wasnt
too
surprised
to
discover
that
the
taste
was
far
smoother
than
i
had
previously
experienced
rich
malts
showed
up
yes
the
hops
jump
up
and
smack
you
but
this
time
i
dont
mind
the
smack
lovely
barleywine
and
i
cant
wait
to
enjoy
this
further
down
the

2005
vintage
this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
blood
red
color
the
head
is
large
is
flufy
and
offwhite
the
lacing
is
long
lasting
and
thorough
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
hops
white
some
floral
and
piney
notes
the
sip
is
juicy
and
hoppy
with
a
piney
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
half
way
between
medium
and
full
bodied
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
barleywine
that
has
potential
to
age
well
an
incredibley
complex
brew
that
is
a
joy
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
loud
but
welcome
a
great
beer
finishes
somewhat
quick
and
slightly
astringent
with
dried
fruits
good
damn
job
sierra
nevada
drinkability
is
good
for
what
it
is
i
love
bitter
beers
and
this
certainly
qualifies
i
could
have
more
than
one
but
not
many
more
will
buy
again
to
drink
and
cellar
drinkabilty

even
for
a
barleywine
i
have
to
give
this
less
than
excellent
points
for
drinkability
because
its
still
so
rugged
and
unsettled
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
something
special
a
beautiful
dark
coppery
color
with
a
giant
three
finger
head
this
beer
has
lots
of
carbonation
the
smell
is
a
full
earthyfruityand
hop
filled
scent
this
is
very
aromatic
the
taste
is
something
to
behold
a
very
hoppy
flavor
with
a
carmel
aftertaste
thats
great
this
has
a
full
mf
thats
very
satisfyingi
only
wish
i
could
have
this
on
tap
this
is
an
excellant
beer
and
i
will
cellar
three
of
my
6
pack
to
see
the
aging
process
2003
vintage
bottle
conditioned
pours
a
murky

sweet
hoppy
aromas
abound
taste
this
is
a
huge
bold
beer
sweet
with
ripe
fruits
tons
of
malt
cascade
hops
and
an
interesting
almost
chocolatey
finish
definitely
benefits
from
age
i
dont
even
drink
the
stuff
unless
its
at
least
a
year
old
rich
full
mouthfeel
drinkability
suffers
because
of
abv
and
richness
but
it
is
not
an
overpowering
beer
you
can
definitely
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
watch
out
a
long
dry
linger
of
barley
and
hops
continues
to
develop
in
aftertaste
making
this
beer
as
drinkable
as
you
want
it
to
be
and
as
savory
as
you
want
it
to
be
thats
the
beauty
in
this
classy
ale
2005
bottle
so
a
little
under
a
year
old
amberorangebrown
color
glows
in
the
light
with
very
little
head
smell
is
big
hops
and
sweet
fruitiness
and
alcohol
some
banana
i
think
smells
bitter
and
sweet
at
once
and
tastes
that
way
too
lots
of
hop
bitterness
and
also
a
syrupy
sweetness
and
syrupy
mouthfeel
can
feel
the
warming
alcohol
this
is
a
big
beer
will
certainly
mellow
with
more
age
but
its
good
this
way
too
thank
you
that
is
all
this
is
my
first
review
fairly
thick
feeling
in
my
mouth
but
still
a
joy
to
drink
even
in
its
infancy
totally
worth
it
to
buy
a
sixer
and
enjoy
them
in
the
future
if
youre
into
cellaring
this
could
be
a
real
fun
beer
to
experiment
with
i
can
get
a
sixer
for
13
thats
six
years
of
cheap
entertainment
if
nothing
else
this
is
a
hopheads
alternative
to
english
barleywine
2004
edition
poured
a
mahagony
color
slightly
hazy
with
respectable
head
that
fell
to
a
nice
sticky
ring
smell
is
a
delightful
mixture
of
malt
and
piney
hops
taste
is
very
strongly
alcoholic
with
only
a
slight
nalt
sweetness
and
some
hop
bitterness
finished
with
very
strong
notes
of
alcohol
very
disappointing
beer
maybe
it
will
be
better
in
another
year
or
two
that
said
my
score
for
this
bottle
when
calculated
was
a
pathetic
3
0
but
thats
not
fair
as
its
an
aged
bottle
and
so
ive
included
my
original
scores
from
the
bottle
i
had
back
in
02
mouth
feel
is
full
bodied
yet
remains
quite
drinkable
prior
to
last
winter
i
knew
sierra
nevada
for
the
ever
popular
pale
ale
the
average
porter
and
pretty
good
stout
after
finding
celebration
and
big
foot
at
super
low
prices
in
the
grocery
store
my
opinion
of
this
brewery
has
changed
greatly
overall
this
beer
is
great
for
sipping
on
a
cold
day
and
one
you
should
put
on
the
musthave
list
for
this
winter
appearance
is
perfect
nice
clear
mahogany
with
a
perfect
1
finger
creamy
head
of
miniscule
bubbles
leaves
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
which
is
very
unexpected
for
the
style
smell
is
almost
all
hops
and
im
not
talking
the
nice
citrusy
hops
that
i
love
pure
pine
needles
there
is
actually
some
caramel
malt
smell
underneath
everything
just
barely
unfortunately
it
doesnt
show
up
in
the
taste
at
first
the
hops
bite
hard
like
eating
pine
needles
then
you
wait
for
the
initial
hop
bite
to
subside
and
for
the
malt
to
smooth
things
over
and
you
can
wait
all
day
if
you
want
but
it
never
happens
the
finish
is
even
worse
its
pure
bitterness
there
is
absolutely
no
flavor
that
lingers
in
the
mouth
just
bitterness
and
linger
it
does
mouthfeel
is
actually
pretty
good
nice
and
thick
and
creamy
like
i
like
my
barleywines
right
now
i
dont
care
how
good
this
will
taste
in
10
years
its
nearly
undrinkable
at
the
moment
12
fl
oz
bottle
bought
at
vinens
verden
odense
denmark
copper
coloured
good
light
tan
head
very
nice
strong
aroma
of
flowery
hops
notes
of
honey
and
fruits
too
hints
of
oak
and
caramel
full
and
rich
mouthfeel
initially
sweet
and
oaky
flavour
of
dried
fruits
then
a
massive
hoppy
bitterness
takes
over
and
lasts
through
the
aftertaste
not
very
well
balanced
imo
the
very
bitter
finish
kind
of
kills
all
other
qualities
this
beer
has
2004
edition
sampled
11604
still
has
the
hallmarks
of
a
very
young
barley
wine
pours
a
rather
lighter
brown
than
one
would
expect
looks
is
very
inviting
like
a
soda
but
once
you
taste
i
get
impressions
of
brown
sugar
and
maple
syrup
but
not
too
much
no
complex
aged
components
yet
but
it
still
carried
a
good
bit
of
ipa
hops
much
more
drinkable
to
the
beginner
like
my
brothers
and
father
who
tried
it
for
the
first
time
than
one
would
expect
of
a
big
beer
awesome
ruby
body
that
is
remarkable
clear
for
a
big
barlewine
obviously
filtered
which
some
may
like
or
dislike
the
sticky
airfilled
head
looked
wonderful
in
my
trois
pistoles
chalice
the
aroma
was
filled
with
a
west
coast
cascade
hop
punch
this
was
like
a
iipa
nose
the
taste
was
very
reminent
of
a
strong
ipa
with
the
hop
bitterness
shining
through
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
of
malt
presence
to
balance
out
the
hops
with
some
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
a
little
rough
so
far
this
beer
is
much
better
after
laying
down
for
a
couple
of
years
i
will
probably
give
a
review
from
an
older
vintage
seeing
as
they
are
much
more
balanced
as
the
hop
bitterness
smooths
out
still
awesome
beer
that
is
one
of
the
best
buys
out
there
overall
this
one
broke
my
barleywine
cherry
im
liking
it
quite
a
lot
so
far
ive
got
a
couple
bombers
of
old
ruffian
in
the
cellar
so
ill
have
to
compare
since
that
one
is
so
highly
regarded
by
bas
i
dont
know
how
drinkable
this
beer
is
but
it
sure
is
delicious
its
huge
but
not
cloying
in
any
way
you
gotta
try
this
on
draft
overall
im
very
impressed
by
the
outcome
of
setting
this
back
flavors
have
calmed
down
and
overall
its
much
more
balanced
im
looking
forward
to
picking
up
some
fresh
and
storing
more
then
2
this
time
notes
this
one
is
big
and
bad
down
right
tasty
great
hop
bitterness
an
incredible
barley
wine
top
notch
the
only
downfall
is
that
i
had
way
too
many
of
these
in
a
short
amount
of
time
this
is
not
something
you
can
drink
5
of
and
mow
the
lawn
well
i
guess
you
can
but
the
lawn
isnt
going
to
come
out
too
good
this
is
not
a
beer
you
will
sit
down
and
have
a
six
pack
of
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
kind
of
beer
i
would
assuredly
purchase
this
beer
again
i
dont
know
if
id
want
a
whole
sixpack
but
another
single
at
the
very
least
would
be
nice
pours
garnet
with
a
low
forming
off
white
head
big
citrus
hops
and
malty
sweet
aroma
a
drink
freatures
mostly
hop
flavor
very
little
malt
makes
it
through
pretty
bitter
this
barleywine
is
more
like
a
big
ipa
i
still
look
forward
to
my
yearly
sixer
the
beer
has
a
fine
body
and
is
quite
drinkable
though
be
wary
i
have
had
more
than
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
this
is
no
session
beer
bigfoot
is
simply
a
fantastic
barleywine
and
i
buy
a
case
whenever
i
see
it
and
can
afford
it
moderately
heavy
body
and
light
carbonation
not
highly
drinkable
but
a
very
tatsy
brew
that
i
will
drink
again
not
for
a
newbie
d
this
goes
down
easily
for
a
barleywine
it
isnt
drying
and
it
wasnt
hard
to
find
the
bottom
of
my
snifter
food
pairing
would
be
difficult
i
would
have
again
though
ive
been
fooled
into
thinking
this
will
have
some
sweetness
once
you
bite
through
the
grapefruit
peels
the
alcohol
hooks
you
through
a
piece
of
rum
soaked
fur
i
feel
like
a
fish
biting
a
fly
it
looks
so
good
smells
good
ouch
im
hooked
ouch
it
kinda
bites
back
but
theres
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
frosting
that
makes
it
a
decent
sip
2005
edition
pours
a
hazy
reddish
brown
iced
tea
colour
big
off
white
head
and
plenty
of
lace
smell
is
deep
rich
malts
caramel
citrus
and
floral
hops
taste
is
caramel
sweetness
up
front
coffeechocolate
middle
and
a
florally
hop
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
smooth
no
rough
edges
very
excellent
beer
bigfoot
is
always
a
pleasure
a
good
time
after
its
release
this
was
no
different
and
stays
true
to
the
barleywine
nature
of
aging
especially
when
done
this
well
this
was
a
2001
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
tawny
redbrown
colour
with
a
minimal
head
what
grabbed
me
was
the
awesome
old
hop
nose
it
was
dignified
yet
once
redolent
of
huge
hops
the
taste
was
refined
and
complex
with
hops
still
in
the
mix
but
new
notes
of
old
fruit
and
tobacco
taking
its
place
i
have
had
fresh
bigfoot
with
all
the
huge
hop
notes
but
this
was
amazingly
sophisticated
due
to
the
age
a
delicious
beer
i
do
believe
that
ill
have
to
change
my
beeradvocate
profile
say
that
barleywine
is
my
favorite
style
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
barleywines
and
hopefully
start
brewing
them
ive
been
enjoying
this
2005
batch
over
the
last
several
months
and
my
advice
is
to
hang
the
hell
on
to
your
stash
bigger
maltier
more
balanced
is
what
you
should
expect
let
me
know
if
you
agree
this
is
a
fine
strong
beer
but
this
one
is
a
bit
unbalanced
though
i
love
bitter
beers
the
hops
are
a
little
distracting
and
there
isnt
quite
enough
complexity
to
the
flavor
that
said
i
have
no
trouble
finishing
the
glass
and
would
certainly
have
another
appearance
is
of
a
thick
creamy
foam
with
nicely
retentive
lacing
and
a
dark
burgundy
color
aroma
consists
of
citrus
hops
and
spruce
banana
brown
sugar
and
malt
chime
in
initial
taste
has
bitter
hops
that
bite
back
followed
by
sweet
malt
and
crackers
there
is
yeast
and
cookie
dough
settling
down
to
a
dry
finish
very
complex
and
very
well
crafted
wonderful
just
a
great
barleywine
grab
a
sixer
or
two
and
spread
them
out
over
a
couple
months
im
loving
this
beer
right
now
some
of
its
abrasiveness
of
youth
is
gone
and
that
lets
some
more
complex
characteristics
come
through
yet
there
is
still
some
fire
there
as
well
belgian
tulip
glass
served
at
bjs
in
boulder
in
july
2005
presented
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
ragged
light
brown
head
clinging
to
itself
in
some
places
and
spilling
down
the
glass
in
other
places
smells
dark
and
citrusy
almost
grapefruit
pith
but
not
quite
perhaps
a
hint
of
pineapple
mixed
in
there
sweet
is
less
noticable
than
the
hops
and
consists
of
caramel
and
some
brown
sugarmolasses
taste
starts
sweet
momentarily
but
then
comes
the
hops
bolstered
by
an
playful
alcohol
citrus
hop
bitter
rises
above
the
caramel
and
rock
candy
sweetness
to
become
almost
edgy
low
cohumulone
is
good
because
it
keeps
this
one
from
going
over
the
edge
the
finish
is
hop
citrusy
complimented
by
the
bitter
and
alcohol
to
leave
my
mouth
dry
hop
flavor
is
mostly
grapefruit
pith
some
tangerine
and
also
a
touch
of
sour
not
quite
plumskin
sour
and
certainly
not
cherry
sour
thick
bodied
and
mildy
carbonated
i
was
concerned
that
fresh
the
hops
would
be
a
bit
too
much
and
the
malt
a
bit
unrefined
instead
the
malt
played
a
nice
supporint
role
to
the
dominant
hop
bitter
and
flavor
to
make
a
multidimensional
beer
with
complimenting
tastes
overall
a
very
drinkable
dare
i
say
sippable
beer
and
im
enjoying
every
sip
of
it
bravo
ive
given
this
about
a
year
to
age
it
is
near
maturity
the
hops
are
so
ever
present
the
sticky
mouthfeel
and
the
sweet
malty
back
bone
make
this
a
full
bodied
sipping
brew
the
alcohol
is
warming
after
the
first
half
a
glass
the
appearance
is
a
deep
ruby
with
highlights
of
copper
nice
foamy
head
in
a
snifter
that
dissipates
quickly
not
a
brew
to
start
the
evening
with
unless
that
is
all
your
going
to
drink
id
say
this
is
the
my
favorite
barleywine
so
far
thanks
to
cafe
volo
for
carrying
it
and
a
lot
of
other
great
beers
drinkability
spectacular
as
the
beer
got
warmer
i
the
taste
improved
with
it
a
great
brew
and
something
that
if
the
weather
and
the
mood
hits
i
cant
wait
to
take
the
rest
out
one
by
one
from
the
cellar
this
is
a
bottle
from
2002
cracked
open
today
chestnut
in
the
glass
no
real
head
to
ooh
and
aah
over
on
the
other
hand
who
cares
as
i
have
a
few
other
senses
to
engage
the
aroma
is
full
of
delightful
things
like
molasses
pine
cones
even
some
dried
hay
in
there
plus
alcohol
on
top
mouthfeel
is
full
but
incredibly
smooth
i
am
picking
up
some
serious
almost
chewy
al
dente
malt
with
some
prickly
piney
hops
good
stuff
it
pours
a
cloudy
amber
w
a
fluffy
head
that
is
just
off
white
as
i
took
a
sniff
it
smelled
of
pine
sap
and
citrus
wow
i
just
took
a
sip
and
got
glued
to
the
glass
by
all
the
pine
loads
of
sticky
sap
for
a
barleywine
hops
heaven
tons
of
caramel
flavors
with
a
hint
of
espresso
in
the
background
the
sweetness
isnt
here
like
other
barleywines
but
still
has
that
touch
of
citrus
i
just
took
another
sip
wow
this
beer
stays
in
your
mouth
the
flavor
keeps
flowing
i
dont
want
this
to
end
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
though
i
feel
as
though
it
is
a
bit
more
on
the
double
ipa
side
well
it
is
border
line
im
going
out
right
now
to
purchace
more
pours
a
deep
orange
with
hues
of
ruby
read
and
a
big
two
finger
offwhite
head
and
decent
lacing
smell
is
excellent
strong
piney
resinous
hops
with
a
little
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
wonderful
as
wellvery
strong
bitter
pine
hops
balanced
with
a
medicinally
sweet
fruity
background
very
intense
flavors
on
both
ends
of
the
spectrum
medium
bodied
with
a
very
smooth
creamy
feel
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
noticable
as
a
warming
in
the
back
of
the
throat
its
been
years
since
i
first
tried
thiswasnt
a
craft
drinker
then
and
hated
it
now
that
i
can
appreciate
the
intense
flavors
this
is
a
masterful
beer
a
rich
deep
ruby
color
and
a
thin
sticky
tan
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
fruity
hops
and
alcohol
sweetness
i
detect
some
sweet
plumbs
the
taste
is
hoppy
bitterness
right
from
the
start
sweet
fruits
alcohol
and
some
pine
like
hops
sweet
dry
hoppy
finish
full
bodied
almost
syrupy
a
kick
to
the
taste
buds
i
must
say
damn
good
2005
batch
this
is
a
review
of
bigfoot
2004
now
about
1
5
yrs
old
pours
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
nose
is
hoppy
somewhat
subdued
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
an
almost
sherry
like
texture
extensive
lacing
is
left
behind
by
this
deep
copper
opaque
nectar
the
alchohol
is
very
present
in
the
taste
making
no
attempt
to
hide
itself
the
balance
of
hoppiness
and
maltiness
is
outstanding
after
aging
the
hops
grab
your
attention
first
followed
by
the
maltiness
then
finally
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
asserts
itself
again
this
is
a
huge
beer
that
i
cannot
drink
quickly
i
like
to
savor
each
taste
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
fine
sherry
in
summary
excellent
tap
pours
nut
brown
with
a
somewhat
reddish
mahagoney
hue
and
a
thin
tan
foamy
head
fragrant
floral
hop
and
sweet
nut
aromas
a
little
roasty
on
the
nose
nutty
and
caramel
malt
flavors
a
quite
hoppy
finish
warm
and
fizzy
fullbodied
palate
very
drinkable
i
did
not
want
to
put
this
brew
down
2005
version
first
beer
i
bought
from
a
small
liquor
store
at
11
pm
after
just
moving
to
california
for
a
year
from
toronto
and
it
didnt
disappoint
pours
a
deep
golden
orange
with
a
dense
white
head
excellent
retention
a
blast
of
hops
grapefruit
and
twang
in
the
nose
the
taste
was
intoxicating
tremendous
bitterness
fruitiness
and
some
hints
of
caramel
and
malt
character
but
other
than
that
just
intense
hop
flavours
that
attack
your
palate
finishes
dry
and
bitter
packed
with
flavour
2002
vintage
revising
review
taste
is
much
better
perhaps
im
serving
a
little
colder
all
the
edge
is
gone
off
this
beer
now
a
slight
hops
bitterness
resides
in
the
undertones
very
thick
in
mouthfeel
packs
a
whollop
definitely
a
beer
that
improves
with
age
im
changing
the
taste
from
3
5
to
4
0
and
also
the
mouthfeel
definitely
one
for
a
cold
night
the
opposite
of
a
lawnmower
beer
12805
overall
sierra
makes
a
damn
good
beer
if
i
may
say
so
myself
this
is
one
i
always
look
forward
to
each
year
2005
bottle
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
half
inch
of
light
tan
head
that
leaves
thick
rings
of
lace
all
around
the
glass
good
staying
power
as
the
head
sticks
along
for
the
ride
big
hop
aroma
with
floral
and
pine
notes
galore
as
it
warms
a
bit
some
of
the
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
peak
through
that
massive
hoppiness
the
flavor
starts
with
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
before
the
huge
dose
of
hops
comes
through
citric
and
earthy
hops
provide
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
though
notably
less
than
previous
years
some
alcohol
notes
but
very
light
a
little
bit
of
sticky
fruit
sweetness
bitter
aftertaste
finishes
this
excellent
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
while
giving
your
tongue
a
light
hop
raking
very
drinkable
this
year
as
well
also
an
well
priced
beer
for
the
style
this
is
definitely
blurring
the
lines
between
double
ipa
and
barley
wine
i
like
mine
fresh
but
it
is
still
great
after
several
years
either
way
its
one
awesome
brew
i
will
be
getting
plenty
of
each
year
great
barleywine
here
to
remind
me
that
i
just
might
like
barleywines
drinkability
unless
you
are
a
fan
of
the
strong
hops
flavors
found
in
ipas
i
wouldnt
suggest
this
beer
the
overwhealming
flavor
unlike
some
other
barleywines
is
hops
everything
about
it
from
the
start
to
finish
leaves
you
with
a
mouthfull
of
that
hop
flavor
enjoyable
pours
a
very
attractive
ruddy
amber
color
with
a
smooth
offwhite
head
aroma
is
surprinsingly
hoppy
lots
of
crisp
citrous
in
the
nose
also
some
sweet
malty
caramel
this
is
one
smooth
ass
barleywine
and
well
balanced
to
boot
lots
of
smooth
sweet
malty
character
with
caramel
notes
hops
are
more
prevalant
than
i
would
have
guessed
for
a
barleywine
almost
like
a
double
ipa
the
incredible
balance
between
hops
and
malt
cover
up
the
alcohol
for
the
most
part
very
full
mouthfeel
drives
this
brew
home
finish
is
resinous
with
hop
oils
slightly
dry
and
sweet
at
the
same
time
devilishly
drinkable
notes
a
great
example
of
what
this
style
can
be
the
price
is
great
this
is
the
poormans
barleywine
drinkability
its
as
if
you
can
taste
the
high
alcohol
volume
in
most
barleywines
but
this
one
is
totally
compensated
with
hops
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
only
if
im
not
driving
9
6
abv
incredibly
smooth
d
this
has
a
nice
depth
of
hops
but
the
malt
is
right
there
standing
out
it
is
well
balanced
and
i
think
this
would
stand
up
to
aging
aswell
the
alcohol
is
nice
but
not
overpowering
in
this
beer
it
has
a
lot
of
big
flavors
but
they
all
work
well
together
the
overall
effect
is
too
raw
maybe
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
would
help
but
i
think
its
still
overcarbonated
drinkability
for
a
barleywine
ale
good
2005
pours
a
dark
reddish
amber
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
not
much
lace
in
this
dishwasher
washed
beer
glass
the
smell
is
pine
and
citrus
hops
some
sweet
malts
and
alcohol
does
have
a
dirty
old
sock
funkyness
that
doesnt
help
anything
but
one
sip
crushes
those
impressions
with
a
big
blast
of
grapefruit
and
towering
northwest
hop
bitterness
followed
by
some
sweet
malt
very
rich
and
full
in
the
mouth
the
guy
at
the
beer
store
remarked
this
years
batch
has
less
a
b
v
than
last
and
im
not
sure
if
that
is
true
or
if
it
changes
anything
taste
was
huge
hops
up
front
that
were
countered
very
nicely
with
the
malt
profile
smoky
earthiness
in
the
hops
with
a
finish
of
caramel
malt
and
an
alcohol
warmth
at
the
back
of
the
throat
full
bodied
and
finishes
off
fairly
crisp
and
slightly
dry
a
top
notch
barley
wine
that
i
buy
every
year
an
awesome
one
got
me
buzzed
american
barleywine
delivered
in
the
typical
sierra
nevada
fashion
a
standrd
setter
compared
to
the
bottle
this
was
substantially
cloudier
and
darker
aromas
flavors
and
mouthfeel
seemed
toned
down
just
a
touch
it
didnt
seem
to
have
the
complete
over
the
top
hop
vibe
going
i
get
from
the
bottle
that
said
it
was
still
very
effin
good
awesome
carbonation
for
a
barleywine
really
helps
balance
things
out
and
not
get
too
syrupy
or
cloying
incredibly
bitter
finish
where
the
hops
assert
themselves
and
dont
let
go
lasting
almost
forever
in
the
mouth
burns
a
bit
when
you
swallow
from
the
strong
hop
presence
and
the
alcohol
starting
to
peak
through
excellent
finish
overall
2005
vintage
bigfoot
is
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
large
very
large
for
a
barleywine
head
the
head
is
tan
and
frothy
with
nice
retention
citrusy
hops
have
a
strong
presence
in
the
aroma
light
caramel
malt
smell
is
also
noted
taste
starts
off
very
hoppy
in
a
west
coast
citrusy
sort
of
way
the
hops
are
soon
joined
by
a
slick
malty
taste
which
give
way
to
more
hops
in
the
finish
fruity
ale
flavors
also
run
throughout
the
sip
this
is
definently
a
west
coast
interpretation
of
the
style
normally
i
like
my
barleywines
a
little
less
hoppy
but
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
10
25
05
so
i
cracked
a
bottle
from
this
same
6
pack
this
past
weekend
10
23
05
and
man
has
it
mellowed
out
on
the
bitterness
much
much
better
and
more
to
what
i
expected
i
updated
the
taste
rating
to
reflect
this
change
id
have
given
this
a
4
5
if
it
tasted
like
this
the
first
time
around
so
i
averaged
the
previous
rating
3
5
and
the
4
5
and
gave
it
a
4
since
im
lead
to
believe
aged
beers
shouldnt
really
be
reviewd
i
figure
inside
a
year
is
enough
leeway
althought
i
wouldnt
consider
this
a
session
brew
it
is
still
quite
drinkable
considering
the
barley
wine
style
all
in
all
a
solid
barley
wine
if
i
had
a
cellar
i
definitely
would
age
this
stuff
for
a
year
or
so
to
mellow
it
our
a
bit
ratings
will
reflect
the
05
beer
just
got
a
case
of
the
2005
for
32
bucks
a
steal
considering
old
horizontal
is
made
right
around
the
corner
and
is
12
bucks
a
six
gonna
cellar
half
the
case
at
least
and
try
again
next
year
whats
the
most
surprising
is
how
easy
this
beer
is
to
drink
no
its
not
like
youre
able
to
slam
it
but
it
goes
down
pretty
goddamn
smooth
for
a
barleywine
really
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
cloudy
deep
amber
with
slow
carbonation
working
its
way
slowly
up
toward
the
the
two
finger
frumpy
tan
head
strong
smell
of
cherries
and
apples
sweet
carmel
and
citrus
notes
chewy
taste
of
cherries
berries
and
dark
fruits
and
honey
orange
peel
hops
come
out
in
the
end
a
lot
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
and
lingering
bitterness
very
heavy
brew
filling
as
they
come
the
fact
that
this
is
so
high
in
alcohol
so
bitter
and
such
a
pungent
beer
makes
this
less
than
totally
drinkable
a
good
beer
to
sip
on
a
brisk
afternoon
but
nothing
id
bring
to
a
get
together
its
pretty
harsh
but
it
is
rather
delicious
in
small
doses
comments
this
beer
makes
me
think
of
sierra
nevda
pale
ale
raised
to
a
higher
power
in
years
past
i
was
not
a
big
fan
of
bigfoot
but
2005
holds
a
lot
of
promise
i
found
this
remarkably
easy
to
drink
considering
the
9
6
abv
im
looking
forward
to
revisiting
this
again
after
it
cellars
for
a
while
plus
at
like
9
a
sixer
the
beerbuck
ratio
is
pretty
sweet
i
braved
the
2005
expedition
and
a
expedition
it
is
this
barleywine
is
young
but
i
braved
it
anyway
it
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
and
has
a
nice
tan
head
that
leaves
thick
sticky
lace
on
my
glass
the
aroma
is
a
wall
of
hops
so
much
so
that
you
can
barely
detect
any
of
the
malt
and
there
is
definitely
a
lot
of
malt
in
this
beer
the
taste
is
a
immediate
assault
of
hops
on
the
tongue
backed
up
by
a
thick
malty
body
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
again
after
it
ages
a
year
or
two
if
i
can
wait
that
long
lastly
it
is
lacking
in
drinkability
simply
because
it
has
a
high
enough
abv
to
smack
you
down
if
you
get
careless
but
then
it
is
so
good
it
is
best
savored
not
swilled
down
like
an
american
piss
beer
hazy
appearance
that
clears
as
it
warms
a
bit
nice
amber
color
unreal
head
retention
and
lacing
given
the
abv
aroma
is
all
hops
i
dont
get
any
malt
character
showing
through
on
this
borderline
imperial
ipa
tastes
follows
aroma
all
hops
resiny
citrusy
hops
they
have
their
place
just
not
at
this
level
in
a
barleywine
in
my
opinion
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
hard
to
get
past
the
hop
bite
in
this
one
this
is
a
superb
vintage
with
everything
in
the
right
place
beautifully
balanced
id
love
to
try
this
sidebyside
with
great
lakes
brewings
nosferatu
but
i
think
bigfoot
will
reign
for
now
very
drinkable
not
the
heavy
syrupy
brew
that
i
was
expecting
this
is
a
great
beer
this
beer
was
awesome
i
couldve
drank
20
of
them
if
i
didnt
start
to
get
drunk
off
just
three
of
them
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
great
beer
everyone
should
try
one
or
two
or
three
of
them
i
was
lucky
to
find
an
04
sixer
that
was
kept
in
a
cooler
at
a
store
i
frequent
ive
always
wanted
to
let
this
stuff
chill
for
a
year
to
see
how
far
it
can
mellow
the
results
so
far
have
been
impressive
now
if
i
can
just
hold
on
to
the
other
five
long
enough
to
see
what
this
brew
can
do
over
a
couple
more
years
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
i
might
have
to
agree
with
those
that
say
this
is
more
like
a
double
ipa
it
is
a
sierra
nevada
interpretation
of
barley
wine
at
any
rate
damn
good
2005
edition
12
oz
with
no
need
for
a
freshness
date
served
slightly
chilled
in
a
snifter
pours
a
dark
dark
red
with
a
hint
of
brown
and
a
light
tan
1
finger
head
the
beer
is
not
quite
cloudy
but
some
sediment
is
floating
around
the
only
scents
are
alcohol
and
hops
granted
the
hops
are
significant
grassy
grapefruit
pine
a
bit
of
tropical
fruit
and
i
can
almost
smell
the
bitterness
taste
delivers
more
alcohol
and
an
assload
of
hops
the
predominant
flavors
are
hop
oils
pine
and
grapefruit
but
they
are
so
strong
i
can
only
detect
the
malts
in
the
mouthfeel
it
is
very
thick
and
coats
the
mouth
well
with
a
bitterness
that
lingers
forever
however
this
bitterness
is
very
intense
coming
from
a
hophead
and
even
though
the
ibus
90
arent
as
high
as
other
beers
ive
had
the
lack
of
enough
malts
to
balance
them
make
it
seem
like
the
most
bitter
beer
ive
had
i
like
my
hoppy
brews
but
i
was
expecting
more
malts
this
seems
more
like
a
dark
double
ipa
than
a
barleywine
theres
no
way
i
could
drink
more
than
2
in
a
night
perhaps
a
few
months
in
the
cellar
will
help
probably
another
beer
that
is
well
suited
for
hop
heads
but
best
avoided
by
those
of
us
seeking
balance
seemingly
a
big
problem
with
california
brewers
in
general
and
sierra
nevada
in
particular
this
beer
pours
an
amber
brown
with
a
decent
head
quite
a
feat
for
a
barleywineno
doubt
due
to
hop
oils
aroma
is
intense
floral
hops
some
malt
sweetness
is
detectable
under
there
as
well
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
overpowering
piney
citrusy
and
floral
hops
has
a
warming
alcohol
sensation
nice
thick
bodied
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
good
for
the
style
but
definatley
a
sipper
poured
2005
vintage
and
watched
as
its
viscus
liquid
fortold
an
awesome
mouthfeel
a
one

with
9

very
respectable
over
a
beautiful
color
the
80ibu

fills
the
room

to

after
an
hour

out
as
it
warms
on
this
feb
65
day
plan
on
laying
down
a
dozen
of
these
in
the
cellar
pours
a
rich
dark
mahogony
with
a
thin
off

head
first
smell
is
floral
and
citric

very
earthy
and
slightly
alcoholic
not
as
malty
sweet
as
i
had

also
initially
zesty

becoming
more
sugary

for
the
cellar
will
review
at
a
later
date
barleywine
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
yet
it
is
so
hard
to
find
i
was
excited
about
this
one
even
though
it
is
not
quite
a
true
barleywine
technically
speaking
but
close
enough
for
me
it
has
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
foam
that
laces
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
taste
has
lots
of
flavors
such
as
coffe
a
little
caramel
and
a
good
dose
of
hops
it
is
a
nice
blend
that
isnt
too
heavy
and
is
complex
enough
that
it
bears
a
few
quaffs
dont
plan
on
driving
home
though
good
stuff
this
beer
will
only
get
better
with
some
aging
to
mellow
if
anything
i
am
having
this
beer
mighty
ripe
but
i
was
very
glad
to
see
it
at
the
store
the
9
6
abv
must
be
discussed
when
reviewing
this
beer
this
is
one
beer
that
deserves
some
respect
its
one
of
the
hoppier
barleywines
that
i
have
had
an
excellent
westcoast
barleywine
with
some
balls
sure
am
glad
i
put
this
away
mmmm
what
a
good
birthday
treat
for
me
like
many
people
bigfoot
was
the
1st
barleywine
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
i
still
hold
it
as
a
standard
to
measure
others
against
and
enjoy
this
beer
year
after
year
i
am
grateful
for
all
of
you
who
took
to
time
to
review
this
beer
it
is
the
only
reason
i
picked
it
up
i
am
glad
i
did
just
hope
i
can
still
find
a
6
pack
before
it
goes
bye
bye
is
this
really
a
barleywine
well
the
hops
are
there
the
problem
lies
in
the
balance
when
i
think
barleywine
i
think
youngs
old
nick
or
even
schlaflys
was
far
closer
judged
as
an
dipa
this
one
would
be
near
the
top
in
fact
ide
give
it
the
edge
over
double
bastard
and
its
like
but
thats
not
the
style
it
has
chosen
to
be
judged
in
have
our
ba
palates
been
so
altered
as
to
forget
that
beer
is
more
than
hops
alone
one
can
be
sure
that
if
youre
looking
for
a
hop
fix
one
need
not
look
further
than
this
but
if
one
wants
to
find
hops
and
malt
in
glorious
balance
and
union
this
aint
it
overall
id
like
to
try
this
one
again
with
some
age
on
it
but
its
pretty
tasty
as
is
its
big
and
strong
but
not
quite
as
outofcontrol
and
toughtodrink
as
insanity
and
a
few
others
in
the
style
yummy
and
extremely
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
comparing
this
to
the
bigfoot
i
had
on
tap
last
august
which
was
horrendously
astringent
and
the
03
i
had
in
october
i
can
honestly
say
the
mellowed
hop
flavor
is
better

the
flavor
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
lots
of
hops
citrus

just
tons
of
hops
for
a
barley
wine
drinkability
isnt
as
great
as
some
because
of
the
high
ibu
and
high
alcohol
id
like
this
one
to
be
a
little
more
balanced
i
bought
a
12
for
18
a
steal
in
michigan
so
im
hoping
i
can
hold
on
to
a
few
for
a
few
years
the
guy
at
the
beer
store
said
that
if
i
had
an
inkling
for
a
barley
wine
i
should
try
a
bigfoot
it
had
a
2005
date
on
the
bottle
cap
while
my
barley
wine
experiences
have
been
brief
this
was
definitely
different
than
all
the
other
barley
wines
drank
until
now
it
poured
copper
in
color
without
any
significant
head
but
there
was
a
thin
film
on
top
of
the
beer
the
aroma
is
purely
of
malts
and
hops
the
flavor
made
me
think
of
crab
grass
ery
sour
with
a
spicy
bite
but
not
sweet
spices
like
other
barley
wines
i
have
partaken
of
but
pepper
and
cumin
more
spicey
spices
a
lot
of
really
good
cooking
recipes
or
so
i
think
at
least
come
to
mind
as
i
drank
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
crisp
but
there
was
a
very
present
alcohol
burn
the
sourness
was
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
and
i
am
not
sure
i
will
want
another
any
time
soon
i
may
throw
the
four
remaining
bottles
into
the
beer
closet
to
see
if
it
improves

time

very

definetely
recommend

this
is
currently

i

drink
me
in
time
my
friends
in
time
i
always
like
to
compare
this
brew
to
old
horizontal
of
which
it
shares
many
similarities
and
it
comes
down
to
a
basic
question
when
evaluating
which
one
is
for
you
do
you
like
more
hops
or
more
malt
bigfoot
seems
to
have
the
hop
market
cornered
here
while
old
horizontal
while
no
slouch
on
the
hops
itself
definitely
takes
the
maltier
less
intense
path
as
for
me
im
gonna
be
buying
a
twelve
of
both
tomorrow
there
is
no
winner
or
loser
in
my
mind
just
two
extraordinary
brews
the
pale
ale
may
get
all
the
attention
but
this
and

are
without
a
doubt

2003
edition
i
believe
i
got
the
opportunity
to
have
a
glass
of
this
and
it
was
aged
twoyears
the
aging
didnt
diminish
much
of
its
hop
character
still
very
hoppy
and
well
preserved
poured
with
a
head
which
just
wouldnt
go
away
still
sizeable
after
everything
but
the
foam
was
consumed
very
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
the
hops
dominated
the
malt
character
which
prevents
this
from
being
perfect
in
the
taste
category
but
excellent
none
the
less
i
would
even
let
this
age
a
couple
more
years
pours
a
lovely
amber
colour
with
a
minimal
head
smell
is
rich
and
malty
with
some
nice
spicy
floral
hops
taste
is
great
so
well
balanced
even
though
it
is
hoppy
strong
malt
uptick
with
a
blast
of
hops
at
the
end
that
more
than
dry
it
out
some
people
say
the
change
in
recipe
has
just
made
this
a
malted
up
hopped
up
snca
i
dont
see
it
it
still
retains
its
barleywine
character
where
as
the
celebration
is
well
a
celebration
of
scathing
hops
mouthfeel
is
good
even
though
it
isnt
that
strongly
carbonated
drinkability
is
dangerously
good
the
near
10
doesnt
stand
out
and
this
is
actually
a
quaffable
barleywine
scary
good
2005
edition
yet
another
nice
beer
from
sierra
nevada
this
one
pours
out
to
a
murky
brownish
in
the
glass
with
a
mediumsized
head
the
aroma
is
that
of
citrus
and
pine
and
malt
the
taste
is
reminiscent
of
the
pale
ale
and
celebration
containing
the
signature
sn
hop
profile
however
it
does
have
some
malt
in
here
which
helps
to
round
it
out
and
mellow
it
out
just
a
bit
on
the
swallow
the
abv
is
well
hidden
this
really
didn
t
seem
like
a
barleywine
to
me
it
seemed
more
in
the
vein
of
an
ipa
if
you
like
hops
and
bitterness
drink
it
now
but
for
me
barley
wine
is
about
deep
maltiness
with
a
bitter
mix
my
expectation
is
that
this
needs
some
time
maybe
three
months
maybe
six
at
that
point
ill
revisit
a
bottle
im
looking
forward
to
it
overall
this
is
a
nice
barleywine
im
really
beginning
to
like
the
style
and
this
is
among
the
better
ones
ive
had
ive
only
had
one
bad
one
and
that
one
was
just
raw
great
way
to
warm
up
on
a
blustery
winter
night
for
a
hop
lover
this
is
a
good
beer
even
if
it
doesnt
follow
the
typical
style
profile
of
most
barleywines
very
typical
sierra
nevada
oh
bigfootgood
stuffs
indeed
still
great
even
though
sierra
nevada
changed
the
hops
around
from
what
i
remember
from
last
years
batch
this
year
has
almost
more
of
a
dark
sierra
nevada
celebration
ale
taste
mixed
in
2
parts
pale
ale
1
part
celebration
ale
in
a
good
way
still
an
awesome
brew
this
year
around
notes
i
must
admit
this
didnt
meet
my
expectations
i
expected
sweeter
more
malt
presence
and
more
alcohol
notes
dont
get
me
wrong
i
really
enjoyed
the
hop
presence
of
this
beer
i
was
just
lamenting
the
other
day
that
i
got
the
last
sixer
of
snca
but
if
i
close
my
eyes
i
cant
tell
much
difference
bt
bigfoot
and
snca
i
can
see
myself
getting
into
a
lot
more
barleywines
if
they
are
like
this
however
i
think
this
is
the
exception
and
not
the
norm
the
scent
is
the
least
in
your
face
out
of
all
the
vintages
hops
seem
a
touch
lighter
and
maybe
just
not
as
much
flavor
overall
smoother
than
most
years
definitely
not
harsh
drinkable
right
now
bigfoot
is
a
staple
that
ive
enjoyed
but
never
gotten
around
to
reviewing
the
beer
that
first
got
me
into
the
barley
wine
style
after
a
year
of
aging
the
drinkability
of
the
2004
is
perfect
and
the
flavor
is
nicely
developing
believe
in
bigfoot

stock
up
drink
a
few
and
let
the
rest
hibernate
in
the
cellar
bigfoot
barleywine
style
ale
is
good
beer
it
isnt
as
hoppy
as
i
had
hoped
and
it
doesnt
surpass
old
foghorn
as
far
as
im
concerned
but
its
reputation
is
well
deserved
i
plan
to
pick
up
at
least
a
sixer
every
year
to
see
how
each
vintage
changes
from
year
to
year
and
how
each
changes

poured
a
clear
red
that
was
very
rich
in
color
with
a
white
head
that
lasted
for
an
amazingly
long
time
for
a
brew
of
this
gravity
the
aroma
was
very
nice
with
a
strong
hop
aroma
that
seemed
a
blend
of
pine
and
citrus
the
taste
was
excellent
as
a
strong
hop
presence
was
immediatly
made
which
segued
smoothly
into
a
sweet
carmelized
malt
flavor
and
finished
with
a
lingering
hop
flavor
and
an
alcoholic
warmth
this
ale
seems
like
it
recieved
a
full
amount
of
aging
and
the
yeast
finished
this
beer
very
cleanly
the
body
complements
the
alcohol
wonderfully
as
it
is
viscous
and
the
light
carbonation
provides
a
touch
of
carbnic
bite
which
offsets
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
and
the
differently
assertive
hops
flavor
very
drinkable
i
try
to
save
some
of
this
every
year
but
it

makes
it

its

what
a

barleywine
the
9
6
abv
makes
this
one
tough
to
drink
as
a
session
beer
but
it
is
certainly
a
treat
for
the
winter
months
probably
my
favorite
sierra
nevada
offering
and
one
of
my
favorite
versions
of
the
style
drinkability
is
dangerous
i
could
easilty
drink
myself
into
oblivion
with
this
one
2004
batch
this
beer
pours
a
very
hazy
dark
reddish
brown
about
a
half
inch
of
bubbly
head
on
top
though
it
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
to
speak
of
quite
aromatic
hops
up
front
but
also
a
big
presence
of
ripe
fruits
like
apircots
and
pears
bigfoot
is
certainly
an
appropriate
name
for
this
brew
big
allaround
flavorful
taste
a
grapey
sweetness
hits
the
palate
first
folowed
by
more
fuity
malts
and
finished
with
a
piney
hop
bitterness
a
lot
of
beers
seem
to
put
the
hop
taste
out
front
but
i
like
that
bitterness
as
sort
of
an
afterthought
in
this
beer
this
beer
is
a
perfect
example
of
a
well
balanced
beer
its
not
too
over
the
top
in
any
particular
feature
but
its
extremely
flavorful
and
has
a
wide
variety
of
complex
tastes
to
be
sought
out
by
the
drinker
exellecent
smooth
and
full
mouthfeel
although
a
lot
of
people
generally
give
these
bigger
beers
a
fairly
low
drinkability
score
i
think
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
as
long
as
you
can
handle
the
10
abv
personally
i
feel
up
to
the
challenge
brown
in
the
glass
a
bit
hazy
with
a
tan
head
smell
is
sweet
and
hoppy
also
a
bit
like
biscuits
baking
in
an
oven
frontal
hop
assault
yeah
not
too
bad
althougth
a
bit
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
tastes
good
yet
harsh
on
my
tounge
i
have
to
take
drinkablity
points
away
because
i
am
only
having
a
bit
of
this
one
all
in
all
i
cant
say
i
recommend
it
yet
its
got
something
going
on
bottled
vintage
1998
thanks
mat
pretty
tasty
stuff
my
memories
are
pretty
vague
and
a
remember
spilling
about
a
quarter
or
so
of
the
contents
of
the
bottle
sorry
everyone
just
really
tasty

the
length

for
spilling

of
it

are

and

with

creamy
two
finger
head
first
sip
brings
a
rush
of
bitter
hoppy
goodness
definetly
green
but
in
a
good
way
especially
for
the
hopheads
a
nice
caramel
nut
chewy
malt
background
just
a
tasty
enjoyable
brew
again
this
year
good
full
mouthfeel
and
quite
drinkable
i
have
a
sixer
saved
for
when
i
go
camping
this
summer
cant
wait
for
that
no
matter
big

is
a
dead

ripper
of
a
brew
that
i
just
didnt

enuff
of
one
of
the
best
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
consuming
this
year
thanks
to
malto
for
the
sample
and
recommendation
the

months
ago
this
makes
it
a
much
more
drinkable
brew
one
of
the
best
bigfoots
of
any
age
or
bottling
barley
wine
in
a
word
yum
i
can
only
handle
a
few
of
these
fullbodied
brews
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
in
the
aroma
and
on
the
tongue
the
color
is
a
warm
brown
with
a
hue
of
red
the
malts
and
hops
are
well
balanced
and
can
only
improve
with
age
in
all
bigfoot
is
a
personal
favorite
overall
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
barleywine
flavor
is
leaning
towards
the
hops
with
a
complex
maltiness
to
balance
it
out
imho
heavy
and
hoppy
could
be
a
little
green
better
over
60f
bottle
poured
a
light
dark
beer
with
a
huge
head
with
excellent
retention
aroma
is
comprised
of
sweet
plums
and
some
nice
malt
taste
is
quite
wonderful
with
again
the
plumsraisins
sweetness
being
noticeable
it
ends
with
a
wonderful
warm
feeling
overall
this
is
a
very
good
barley
wine
and
would
like
to
taste
this
again
on
a
warm
winter
night
5
years
and
this
baby
still
pours
with
a
nice
tan
head
sticks
around
longer
than
i
expected
sweet
smelling
i
can
tell
now
this
beer
is
big
on
flavor
sure
enough
the
malt
stands
up
and
smacks
me
right
across
the
face
do
they
dip
nuts
in
carmel
bitterness
is
much
more
subdued
than
in
the
fresher
samples
i
have
enjoyed
piney
taste
turns
piney
after
the
initial
blast
of
sweetness
enjoyed
2004
12oz
bottle
in
mid
august
2004
poured
into
a
big
wine
goblet
its
wine
right
the
tan
head
quickly
diminished
into
the
beautiful
hazy
reddishcopper
liquid
below
i
couldnt
stop
taking
whiffs
of
this
beer
it
smelled
divine
all
of
the
following
were
detected
by
my
mere
novice
nose
sweet
caramel
malts
sour
and
dark
fruits
like
raisins
and
cherries
vanilla
toffee
brown
sugar
honey
pepper
and
spices
bourbon
and
with
a
big
enough
sniff
straight
up
alcohol
hows
that
for
a
bouquet
i
dove
right
into
it
to
find
extremely
complex
tastes
it
seemed
that
right
off
the
bat
my
taste
buds
experienced
a
candylike
sweetness
that
was
almost
immediately
punched
in
the
face
by
a
powerhouse
of
spicy
bitter
hops
its
a
pretty
amazing
taste
experience
the
finish
is
so
so
bitter
but
eventually
i
warmed
right
up
to
it
literally
tastes
included
raisins
tangy
and
sour
fruits
toffee
and
grapefruit
typical
of
sierra
nevada
the
mouthfeel
is
absolutely
incredible
extremely
smooth
but
thick
and
chewy
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
keep
your
taste
buds
from
falling
asleep
drinkability
well
id
definitely
have
another
but
not
in
the
same
session
this
is
an
amazing
beer
that
allegedly
gets
better
with
a
little
age
apparently
its
hoppiness
mellows
out
over
time
and
for
someone
like
me
thats
a
good
thing
this
12
oz
2004
vintage
bottle
was
provided
to
me
as
an
undeserved
bonus
by
a
fellow
georgian
ba
southernbrew
the
hazy
copper
red
appearance
with
a
steady
carbonation
that
fed
a
generous
head
that
left
oodles
of
lacing
while
dissipating
made
this
is
one
beautiful
looking
beer
the
initial
aroma
was
a
wave
on
piney
cascade
hops
that
nearly
singed
my
nostrils
deeper
sniffs
revealed
layers
of
caramel
malt
vinous
and
spicy
alcohol
and
ripe
tropical
fruit
the
taste
was
sweet
plums
raisins
chestnuts
caramelized
sugar
and
grapefruit
that
softened
up
the
palette
up
front
for
an
unrelenting
assault
of
hop
bitterness
and
peppery
alcohol
zing
that
lingered
long
after
each
sip
surprisingly
the
finish
on
the
beer
was
again
quite
sweet
with
a
toffee
like
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
chewy
and
quite
soothing
despite
the
dance
of
flavors
going
on
in
the
mouth
this
is
one
marvelous
brew
that
should
improve
tremendously
with
age
although
i
did
not
have
the
patience
to
save
the
one
bottle
i
acquired
this
year
come
2005
i
will
surely
be
jumping
all
over
this
one
when
i
see
it
thank
you
southernbrew
pours
a
nice
dark
mahogany
red
with
a
thick
cream
off
white
head
that
is
gorgeous
the
smell
is
a
blast
of
citrusy
pine
hops
with
hints
of
spices
and
sweet
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
strong
up
front
with
citrus
pine
hops
blends
well
with
the
apple
crumb
center
and
the
thick
syrup
ending
the
spiced
malts
perfectly
blend
with
the
bitterness
wow
really
gives
the
tatebuds
a
kick
medium
to
full
bodied
and
will
call
you
back
for
more
damn
good
pours
a
deep
deep
garnet
with
a
thick
head
that
disappears
almost
instangly
but
leaves
the
beautiful
lacing
upon
it
aroma
is
of
big
malt
with
some
hops
it
smells
rich
to
tell
the
truth
it
prepares
you
for
the
big
flavors
of
thick
intitial
malt
taste
with
the
hint
of
hops
finishing
with
a
mouthful
of
hop
bitterness
aftertaste
and
the
malt
peeking
through
the
spaces
between
your
tongue
yum
yum
to
the
hop
aftertaste
its
thick
and
wonderful
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
barleywine
style
but
this
one
is
pretty
damn
amazing
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
coating
it
goes
down
well
but
excessive
hop
burn
detracts
from
the
drinkability
so
what
about
the
high
abv
let
this
one
be
your
nightcap
before
you
pass
out
into
the
luxe
of
your
bed
its
just
way
too
fresh
if
you
pick
some
of
this
up
cellar
it
forget
about
for
six
months
or
so
and
come
back
to
it
when
the
hops
mellow
out
it
should
kick
ass
bigfoot
2004
pours
a
deep
brassy
gold
with
hints
of
purple
the
aroma
is
of
malt
and
alcohol
the
look
and
smell
hold
the
promise
of
a
hardhitting
beer
the
taste
is
a
little
surprising
being
pretty
bitter
with
a
lot
of
malt
in
the
background
its
feel
is
very
oily
and
leaves
a
lot
of
caramel
on
your
tounge
i
dont
find
this
to
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
only
times
ive
found
it
to
be
satisfactory
is
when
i
wanted
a
large
volume
of
alcohol
or
on
the
end
of
large
volume
of
beer
as
it
warms
the
bitterness
becomes
overpowering
after
trying
youngs
old
nick
i
purchased
a
six
of
this
expecting
a
real
treat
that
was
in
january
i
am
drinking
the
fourth
now
in
july
a
move
towards
the
balance
you
see
in
youngs
old
nick
would
be
welcome
drink
this
big
hairy
nw
barleywine
slowly
perhaps
alternating
sips
with
bites
from
a
slice
of
extrasharp
cheddar
cheese
and
you
may
very
well
have
a
religious
experience
overall
another
great
job
by
sierra
nevada
thank
god
i
have
10
of
these
in
my
cellar

poured
a
dark
orangebrown
with
a
small
bubbly
head
that
had
good
staying
power
smell
is
distinctly
hoppy
with
some
alcohol
overtones
and
a
slight
hint
of
caramel
taste
is
superb
with
the
hops
as
the
vanguard
the
sweet
malt
hangs
in
the
air
with
a
piney
nutty
feel
that
i
just
cant
pin
down
tantalizing
the
taste
buds
before
they
are
overwhelmed
by
the
hop
thunder
mouthfeel
is
divine
my
tastebuds
are
almost
not
worthy
of
the
yeti
in
this
mysterious
brown
bottle
pours
a
slightly
murky
orange
hue
under
a
voluminous
what
at
that
abv
3
finger
beige
head
with
great
body
and
lots
of
lace
as
it
slowly
settle
and
drops
down
the
glass
sweet
syrupy
malt
nose
typical
of
a
barley
wine
very
thick
mouth
with
high
carbonation
lots
of
flavors
here
from
caramel
and
barley
to
pine
and
floral
hops
the
blend
is
smooth
but
the
components
are
also
easy
to
pick
out
with
the
malt
surfacing
early
then
yielding
to
a
substantial
dry
bite
the
aftertaste
mirrors
the
experience
with
an
almost
honey
sweetness
competing
against
coffee
ground
bitterness
this
is
a
truly
exceptional
product
update
i
found
this
on
tap
and
had
to
try
it
even
though
i
knew
it
wasnt
my
favorite
more
mellow
less
assertive
hops
and
a
nicer
malt
balance
still
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
my
favorites
but
its
much
nicer
on
tap
when
its
fresh
definitely
a
beer
i
will
never
drink
again
barely
able
to
choke
this
one
down
and
it
wasnt
because
of
the
alcohol
it
did
not
improve
as
the
temperature
came
up
quite
the
opposite
one
was
definitely
enough
if
you
want
a
barleywine
style
ale
i
would
suggest
anchors
old
foghorn
instead
or
any
other
huge
flavorful
beer
nice
job
of
hiding
the
alcohol
definitly
a
hop
heads
version
of
a
barleywine
2004
vintage
bottle
pours
a
reddishcopper
coler
with
nice
121
inch
head
that
takes
sometime
to
dissipate
aroma
is
a
rich
malty
sweetness
that
has
a
slight
alcohol
smell
at
the
end
a
nice
mouthful
that
is
not
to
heavy
taste
has
a
nice
level
of
sweetness
which
is
complimented
by
the
bitterness
that
comes
through
on
the
finish
a
slight
fruitiness
is
detectable
but
is
definetaly
an
undertoned
taste
which
considering
the
near
10
abv
helps
mask
higher
alcohol
content
the
finish
lasts
for
several
minutes
which
includes
the
sweetness
and
bitterness
i
will
admit
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
for
many
years
highly
recommended
this
is
a
very
drinkable
barleywine
if
you
are
a
fan
of
ipas
someone
less
enamoured
of
hops
might
find
it
a
tad
bit
bitter
but
what
would
they
be
doing
drinking
a
barleywine
anyhow
this
is
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
in
a
while
and
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
is
when
the
flavors
have
melded
a
bit
im
going
to
buy
a
sixer
of
this
at
the
next
opportunity
if
a
guy
can
tolerate
the
intensity
this
is
quite
nice
the
older
i
get
the
more
i
enjoy
these
poured
a
dark
fiery
amber
with
a
white
head
that
laced
well
down
the
glass
very
hoppy
aroma
with
some
fruity
hints
also
the
alcohol
is
present
in
the
smell
very
hoppy
taste
but
the
fruity
hints
make
it
less
bitter
than
one
would
expect
goes
down
smooth
9
6
is
a
decent
abv
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
for
a
beer
of
this
caliber
would
recommend
highly
especially
if
you
like
barley
wines
despite
the
biggish
alcohol
content
i
found
this
pretty
drinkable
even
on
a
muggy
warm
night
in
the
winter
this
would
be
superb
drink
this
one
over
an
hour
and
taste
all
it
has
to
offer
as
the
beer
slowly
warms
to
room
temp
each
temperatures
changes
the
nuances
of
this
beer
for
a
great
experience
not
for
the
fainthearted
or
those
used
to
drinking
flavorless
beer
overall
this
is
a
great
barleywine
though
quite
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
i
like
my
barleywines
to
be
the
reminds
me
more
of
an
imperial
ipa
than
a
barleywine
but
overall
this
is
a
topshelf
beer
from
start
to
finish
best
of
all
i
now
have
a
basis
of
comparison
for
aging
big
grapefruit
citrus
hop
aroma
some
candied
floral
hops
all
on
a
solid
malt
base
light
resinous
brown
head
left
a
bit
of
lace
as
it
faded
to
a
film
mahogany
colored
beer
with
a
brilliant
ruby
hue
butterscotch
malt
flavor
up
front
followed
quickly
by
an
infusion
of
hops
finished
with
an
incredibly
hoppy
bitterness
lots
of
potent
flavors
in
this
tasty
young
beer
taste
hops
overload
wow
sweet
on
the
palate
with
a
definite
hop
bite
this
is
a
very
good
barley
wine
a
little
too
hoppy
for
what
i
like
in
the
style
but
very
good
nonetheless
alcohol
is
definitely
sneaky
here
one
must
be
careful
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
expected
for
the
style
a
bit
of
a
bitter
hop
shock
but
smooth
enough
to
drink
easily
overall
a
bit
of
a
brandy
nature
with
some
dry
hops
thrown
in
needs
to
lay
down
for
a
year
or
two
to
let
the
hops
subside
a
little
apperance
at
a
new
store
in
town
is
greatttt
my
first
bigfoot
2004
model
and
my
first
barley
wine
deep
copper
color
with
nice
cream
color
head
that
falls
to
nice
ring
of
foam
smells
of
wondeful
floral
hops
and
a
touch
of
malt
tastes
great
mmm
beer
big
malt
body
complemented
by
hop
flavor
not
overly
bitter
perfection
in
balance
tastes
smooth
and
wonderful
mouthfeel
is
heavier
then
it
looks
this
could
be
dangerous
think
i
could
finish
the
whole
six
now
wish
i
had
opportunity
to
compare
other
years
this
is
one
great
brew
will
be
buying
atleast
a
12
tomorrow
if
not
more
they
only
had
2
cases
love
this
beer
nice
thick
chewy
mouth
feel
drinkability
is
high
because
the
alcohol
isnt
prevalent
in
the
flavor
this
is
deceptive
because
it
catches
up
latter
on
very
nice
a
2004
dark
amber
in
apperance
nice
offwhite
foamy
head
of
an
inch
or
so
at
initial
pour
a
quarter
inch
head
hangs
around
for
the
duration
a
floral
smell
and
taste
taste
is
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
lingual
taste
buds
feel
some
what
ignored
a
floral
taste
comes
to
mind
plenty
of
abv
but
not
noticeable
to
the
palate
enjoy
this
fine
barley
wine
i
could
only
drink
about
half
of
one
maybe
barleywines
arent
for
me
ill
hide
away
the
rest
of
the
six
for
a
year
and
see
what
that
does
for
it
in
my
growing
appreciation
of
barleywine
brews
this
seems
to
be
a
very
good
one
i
really
liked
the
dark
bronze
appearance
with
the
tannish
head
that
was
medium
lasting
the
aroma
is
one
of
very
hoppy
smell
with
a
very
definite
under
smell
of
citrus
the
taste
is
of
one
very
strong
hops
with
a
citrus
undertone
but
it
is
all
overwhelmed
by
the
big
malt
taste
and
strong
alcohol
content
at
the
end
it
feels
creamy
and
thick
in
the
mouth
it
is
drinkable
from
first
sip
to
last
but
this
is
a
deceptively
strong
beer
and
some
care
is
needed
definitely
enjoyable
but
i
think
letting
a
couple
sit
for
a
while
will
do
them
some
good
2003
12
oz
bottle
sampled
41404
the
beer
is
a
cloudy
mahogony
color
there
was
quite
a
bit
of
head
immediately
after
the
pour
but
it
went
down
quickly
aroma
has
notes
of
grapefruit
hops
maybe
a
hint
of
maple
syrup
too
the
taste
is
actually
a
bit
harsh
i
had
expected
it
to
mellow
more
strong
hop
taste
with
a
huge
malt
body
evening
the
taste
out
there
was
a
hint
of
an
almost
burnt
roastiness
of
chocolate
in
the
background
good
but
i
expected
it
to
be
better
i
just
tried
the
2008
version
a
cut
above
the
previous
offerings
a
beer
this
good
comes
around
on
rare
ocassions
another
update
as
i
finish
this
sixpack
the
hops
are
too
overpowering
i
must
reduce
my
rating
overall
an
interesting
blend
of
flavors
but
a
little
harsher
than
some
barley
wines
ive
had
drinkability
is
ok
but
not
great
quite
an
overwhelming
beer
not
big
on
drinkability
but
great
for
the
right
occassion
winter
warmer
apertif
dessert
beer
there
was
also
a
nice
fruit
scent
present
as
the
ale
hit
the
tastebuds
i
could
taste
raisins
figs
grapes
and
apples
as
well
as
the
chocolate
and
molasses
tasting
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
as
the
carbonation
is
right
on
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
that
is
remarkably
smooth
for
a
barleywine
i
could
definitely
sit
back
and
drink
several
of
these
notes
a
bit
more
balanced
than
previous
years
with
that
same
trademark
hardcore
hop
character
this
is
the
big
mamma
of
hoppy
barleywines
and
you
have
to
love
the
stuff
this
is
a
well
aged
beer
if
you
have
the
willpower
ive
had
this
before
and
i
thought
i
had
already
reviewed
it
oh
well
ill
do
it
now
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
head
some
sticky
lacing
and
head
retention
aroma
of
grapefruit
and
malt
leaps
out
of
the
bottle
strong
bitter
and
green
tasting
reminds
me
of
home
grown
as
strong
tasting
a
beer
this
side
of
ww2002
as
youll
find
right
up
there
with
old
crusty
in
that
regard
a
blast
for
the
tastebuds
also
a
boot
in
the
arse
alcohol
doesnt
dominate
the
taste
but
its
in
there
ill
have
to
grab
a
few
more
to
keep
around
for
when
the
mood
strikes
me
you
gotta
love
this
brewery
for
consistent
quality
deep
coppery
red
color
with
a
tan
head
fresh
hops
anda
berries
dominate
the
smell
there
is
also
cocoa
and
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
i
taste
raspberries
a
little
pear
caramel
a
dry
chocolate
flavor
something
buttery
brown
sugar
and
some
piney
hops
kick
towards
the
end
but
are
present
throughout
with
a
lingering
bitterness
not
syrupy
thick
like
some
barleywines
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
realy
cant
ask
for
anything
more
from
a
mouthfeel
when
coupled
with
the
taste
of
it
sierra
nevada
does
it
again
2004
edition
hey
guess
what
its
a
sierra
nevada
brew
and
there
are
lots
of
hops
but
anyway
this
is
actually
a
pretty
well
balanced
beer
i
was
expecting
to
be
blown
away
by
hoppiness
especially
for
a
barleywine
but
that
was
simply
not
the
case
sure
there
were
strong
hop
characters
to
this
barleywine
but
it
is
also
nicely
malty
bigfoot
pours
a
nice
dark
slightly
cloudy
reddish
brown
with
a
very
nice
head
with
good
lace
the
smell
is
equal
parts
hop
and
malt
with
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
to
tickle
the
nose
as
the
ale
hits
your
tongue
the
warming
and
molasses
like
malt
flavors
dominate
and
then
there
is
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
sweetness
only
to
be
followed
up
by
the
hop
bitterness
and
citric
flavors
good
full
body
and
carbonation
also
enhance
this
beer
all
in
all
a
very
good
barleywine
especially
for
one
so
young
i
look
forward
to
aging
another
and
giving
another
go
of
this
in
the
future
notes
2004
edition
for
a
barleywine
to
taste
this
good
this
early
is
a
testament
to
how
excellent
the
brewery
is
to
me
this
is
nearly
the
perfect
beer
dont
be
scared
off
by
the
high
alcohol
content
more
beers
should
be
just
like
this
i
love
it
this
beer
leaves
a
wonderful
lace
and
has
a
great
head
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
nothing
short
of
amazing
taste
is
fantastic
color
is
a
rusty
bubbly
and
quite
dazzling
array
of
sheer
beer
goodness
or
perhaps
godliness
mouthfeel
is
understated
at
first
then
sneaks
up
on
you
with
a
vengeance
leaving
you
with
a
slight
bitterness
and
hoppy
aftertaste
i
drink
this
beer
and
think
of
benjamin
franklins
statement
that
beer
is
proof
that
god
loves
us
and
wants
us
to
be
happy
im
still
a
novice
to
the
barleywine
style
and
if
i
were
tasting
this
blind
i
would
think
i
was
sipping
a
nice
imperial
ipa
certainly
bigfoot
was
an
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
ale
regardless
of
its
nomenclature
2004
batch
served
in
a
brandy
snifter
the
appearance
was
good
dark
orange
with
a
small
head
of
dense
small
bubbles
that
left
quick
it
also
left
a
nice
curtain
of
lacing
very
clear
for
the
style
imo
not
a
bit
of
yeast
floating
around
in
there
very
unlike
some
others
such
as
dfhs
olde
school
barley
wine
the
smell
was
excellent
piney
hoppy
and
solvent
alcohol
all
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
i
was
drinking
it
from
a
snifter
i
suppose
the
taste
was
excellent
as
well
much
more
hoppy
than
i
expected
big
oily
bitter
hops
no
less
right
upfront
balanced
by
the
piney
flavor
and
equally
big
sweet
malt
backbone
very
well
balanced
more
so
than
victorys
old
horizontal
the
finish
was
warming
alcohol
that
seemed
to
evaporate
out
of
your
nostrils
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
too
velvety
smooth
although
more
carbonated
than
i
expected
and
a
tad
filling
the
filling
feeling
is
the
only
reason
i
didnt
give
it
a
4
5
on
drinkability
the
taste
is
there
but
as
with
all
big
beers
i
would
probably
not
session
with
this
brew
all
in
all
an
excellent
example
of
this
style
in
fact
my
favorite
poured
a
dark
hazy
sienna
with
smallish
head
but
thats
my
fault
spotty
lacing
but
overall
a
nice
looking
beer
wonderful
aroma
overwhemling
scents
of
pine
roasted
malts
and
oily
hops
theres
something
else
there
too
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
but
its
pleasant
this
on
has
a
big
chewy
mouthfeel
with
the
aroma
still
stealing
the
scene
taste
this
is
one
big
tasting
brew
more
pine
and
malt
sweetness
with
a
big
hop
follow
up
to
match
a
superbly
balanced
beer
with
a
nice
warming
alcohol
finish
a
must
try
mediumfull
body
great
drinkability
for
a
barleywine
good
beer
nice
for
multiple
beers
and
a
great
introductory
barleywine
style
beer
for
those
just
getting
aquainted
with
beer
tasting
this
is
one
hell
of
a
big
beer
i
am
impressed
at
its
strength
of
flavors
this
long
after
it
was
brewed
excellent
beer
well
deserving
of
my
rating
4
5
out
of
5
swills
ive
got
a
few
of
these
put
away
for
a
special
occasion
ill
be
drinking
those
at
about
one
year
from
bottling
maybe
things
will
mellow
out
by
then
2004
vintage
the
brew
poured
somewhat
thin
and
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
mustardtan
head
appearancewise
it
looked
more
like
an
amber
ale
than
a
barleywine
the
aroma
was
a
bit
hoppy
with
pepperlike
hints
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
but
coating
with
a
bit
of
a
carbonated
bite
the
aftertaste
was
bitter
with
a
tinge
of
alcohol
the
flavor
hard
to
grasp
some
woody
hints
some
hop
indications
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
but
overall
the
experience
was
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
barleywine
to
me
that
makes
it
pretty
drinkable
but
maybe
it
needs
a
lot
more
time
before
it
impresses
me
like
it
seems
to
impress
so
many
others
i
sit
in
a
cold
maine
winter
and
know
i
have
been
vanquished
by
a
beer
i
dont
think
i
ever
asked
for
that
i
wouldnt
advise
driving
after
having
one
of
these
i
wouldnt
advise
standing
up
if
you
have
three
drinkability
good
enjoyable
beer
oh
man
this
is
nice
poured
a
deep
dark
red
with
the
perfect
head
and
major
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
of
big
ripe
dark
fruits
and
hops
a
pleanty
the
taste
was
bold
and
beautiful
strong
alchohol
presence
perfectly
carbonated
sweet
and
syrupy
but
the
hops
brightened
things
up
nicely
i
did
not
find
this
to
be
overly
hoppy
like
some
others
noted
i
felt
the
hops
livened
things
up
a
lot
and
made
it
seem
a
tad
lighter
than
other
barley
wines
ive
had
i
have
cellared
a
six
of
this
with
a
12
of
old
horizontal
for
a
couple
months
to
see
how
these
age
this
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
and
although
very
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
at
9
or
higher
watch
out
beer
is
good
happy
beering
sharp
grapefruit
lemon
zest
and
a
bit
of
a
metallic
bite
provide
quite
a
bite
the
piney
esters
of
whole
fresh
hops
and
the
big
alcohol
kick
remain
quite
separate
from
the
other
tastes
which
begin
to
mingle
halfway
through
the
glass
bigfoot
is
an
original
northwest
americanstyle
barleywine
i
hope
that
just
because
something
else
more
extreme
flavorwise
or
more
potent
in
the
abv
department
comes
along
doesnt
relegate
this
wonderful
brew
to
the
back
shelf
long
live
the
legend
of
bigfoot
pours
a
clear
amberruby
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
thick
tan
head
rests
atop
this
beer
thick
aromas
of
malt
and
hops
waft
from
my
glass
as
i
pour
the
hops
dominate
the
aroma
citrus
dark
fruit
pine
alcohol
and
a
nectar
like
quality
are
all
in
the
nose
thick
bodied
with
a
slightly
syruppy
consistency
the
taste
is
sweet
with
american
hops
bursting
forth
all
over
the
place
a
strong
malt
character
caramel
biscuit
is
here
but
it
is
definitely
subservient
to
the
hops
in
this
fresh
example
the
malt
only
serves
as
a
vehicle
to
allow
the
hops
to
express
themselves
to
the
fullest
this
is
a
brew
that
suggests
what
it
would
be
like
to
suckle
from
a
flower
fat
with
lupulin
glands
thanks
for
reading
my
review
very
great
tasting
beer
its
strong
and
has
a
high
alchohol
content
so
i
dont
know
if
its
a
great
idea
to
slam
these
but
they
are
definitly
a
great
drink
123005
i
tried
one
of
my
aged
bottles
2004
edition
and
it
did
mellow
out
quite
a
bit
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
the
caramellike
malts
were
noticable
while
still
a
very
hoppy
brew
it
was
dare
i
say
it
easier
to
drink
some
woody
qualities
that
i
really
didnt
notice
before
became
noticable
i
have
another
bottle
of
this
that
i
think
i
will
sample
in
another
year
to
see
if
it
progresses
any
more
the
beer
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
an
awesome
hop
scent
surrounded
by
a
fine
malty
base
the
taste
is
good
it
is
intensely
malty
with
an
equally
intense
hop
flavor
it
goes
down
easy
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
great
barleywine
it
has
real
good
flavor
this
is
the
best
beer
sierra
nevada
produces
great
beer
not
for
the
uninitiated
but
if
youve
been
holding
out
because
sn
is
a
bigger
company
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
up
a
6
of
snbf2k4
beef
notes
a
topnotch
barley
wine
here
the
hop
profile
is
still
a
little
too
floral
for
my
tastes
but
this
doesnt
take
much
away
from
the
beer
as
a
whole
if
anything
it
adds
to
the
astounding
character
of
the
brew
ill
have
to
get
some
more
for
cellaring
2004
vintage
i
felt
that
i
should
rereview
this
beer
because
i
feel
this
years
version
to
be
top
notch
pours
such
a
beautiful
dark
reddish
mahogany
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
lasts
and
leaves
sheets
of
lace
down
the
glass
monstorous
sweet
malt
aroma
of
camelized
fruit
with
thick
pine
sap
hop
notes
full
unbelievably
chewy
mouthfeel
with
an
appropriately
low
level
of
carbonation
which
amazingly
still
retains
some
crispness
liquid
silk
huge
sweet
crystal
malt
and
brown
sugar
sweetness
hold
up
extroadinarly
well
against
a
resinous
piney
hop
blast
the
balance
of
this
years
version
right
out
of
the
box
is
jawdropping
finishes
long
and
sweet
yet
oh
so
delicously
bitter
the
harmony
of
this
beer
is
enough
to
make
one
cry
too
much
hops
for
a
barleywine
thats
what
sn
is
all
about
and
this
is
what
theyre
going
for
and
they
do
it
remarkably
well
difficult
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
night
but
what
a
treat
to
have
that
one
absolutely
superb
rating
reflects
2004
vintage
gonna
try
to
age
a
bottle
or
two
and
see
what
happens
mahogany
red
with
a
small
creamy
tan
head
decent
enough
lacing
too
the
smell
is
all
pine
and
grapefruit
and
subtle
chamomile
a
fruity
sweetness
attempts
to
bring
some
balance
but
is
banished
with
extreme
prejudice
by
the
ruthless
hops
the
taste
the
oral
assault
more
appropriately
bitter
in
a
number
of
ways
first
invogorating
then
antiseptic
and
finally
numbing
pine
flavors
and
grapefruit
flavors
battle
for
dominance
while
a
mild
spiciness
caresses
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
beyond
chewy
slick
and
oily
this
brew
crawls
down
your
throat
niiice
drinkability
is
the
only
letdown
but
the
massive
hops
cover
up
the
high
abv
very
well
yum
i
will
lay
this
down
for
at
least
a
year
and
see
what
happens
hopefully
some
more
of
the
malt
characteristics
will
come
through
color
is
absolutely
beautiful
akin
to
a
mohagony
red
with
highlights
however
head
is
small
in
size
and
there
seems
to
be
no
lacing
aroma
is
straight
up
hops
signature
cascade
hops
from
sierra
nevada
alcohol
is
also
present
in
the
smell
taste
is
too
complex
for
me
to
describe
more
flavors
continually
come
i
cant
describe
them
all
big
flavors
citric
hops
upfront
caramel
malt
is
lean
but
present
more
malt
sweetness
in
the
body
some
fussel
alcohol
hits
me
towards
the
finish
grapefruits
become
very
pronounced
in
the
end
aftertaste
is
quite
bitter
this
was
an
extroadinary
beer
the
mixture
of
flavors
is
excellent
and
alcohol
fits
perfectly
im
proud
to
call
this
one
american
i
actually
like
this
beer
a
little
better
when
fresh
its
great
for
aging
but
the
grapefruity
power
to
the
hops
seems
to
appeal
to
the
closet
hophead
in
me
the
beer
physically
abuses
your
tastebuds
all
the
way
through
i
can
only
do
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
at
a
time
it
gets
slightly
milder
with
some
age
but
i
really
dont
like
too
much
big
beer
at
once
its
really
one
of
the
truly
great
american
barleywines
though
a
benchmark
for
the
style
hoppy
nose
rich
thick
mouthfeel
rum
brandy
type
flavor
notes
alcohol
obviously
present
warming
rich
malt
center
and
a
wollop
of
hops
citrus
resin
pine
notes
this
one
is
a
whole
lot
of
beer
malt
hops
alcohol
strong
flavors
yet
it
remains
in
balance
a
favorite
that
deserves
the
high
marks
it
typically
gets
oelergud
as
soon
as
the
bottle
is
opened
a
huge
christmas
tree
aroma
burst
into
the
room
can
you
say
cascade
it
then
pours
clear
copper
with
not
much
of
a
head
offwhite
aroma
is
probably
the
most
potent
cascade
use
ive
ever
encountered
its
as
intense
as
any
other
barleywines
nose
big
deep
with
a
ridiculously
heavy
grapefruitpinefloral
character
the
taste
is
earthy
a
coniferous
forest
in
spring
with
a
slight
hint
at
alcohol
nice
aftertaste
which
lasts
forever
but
is
a
bit
astringent
mediumbodied
while
this
is
very
bitter
its
also
pretty
sweet
and
a
little
sour
from
overhopping
id
definitely
like
to
try
this
aged
a
bit
to
complexify
the
flavors
a
bit
but
young
this
is
one
big
hopheads
beer
therefore
not
exactly
my
bag
quite
citric
even
for
an
american
barleywine
similar
to
hog
heaven
but
displays
a
better
body
and
more
balance
i
had
this
on
tap
but
forgot
to
ask
about
the
vintage
i
assume
that
it
was
a
2004
the
beer
was
a
deep
read
with
a
whitish
head
that
left
a
fair
amount
of
lace
in
my
pint
glass
this
is
a
heavily
hopped
barleywine
the
taste
and
smell
are
both
in
your
face
i
tend
to
prefer
slightly
milder
barlewyines
but
completely
understand
that
sierra
nevada
is
going
for
something
different
i
really
enjoyed
the
malt
complexities
that
lurked
just
below
the
bitter
surface
the
bigfoot
is
an
interesting
concept
brought
to
fruitful
realization
2004
expedition
poured
a
beautiful
firey
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thick
head
huge
floral
cascade
aroma
with
bready
malt
underneath
mouthfeel
is
full
and
smooth
with
a
tongue
numbing
bitter
hop
sting
at
the
end
the
flavor
here
is
sweet
and
syrupy
with
a
huge
amount
of
bittering
hops
and
notes
of
grapefruit
and
peaches
plenty
of
malt
to
hold
it
all
together
and
this
is
one
angry
and
intense
brew
theres
no
escaping
the
bitterness
in
this
young
brew
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
ages
sneaky
for
its
size
bigfoot
is
an
apt
name
pours
a
nice
dark
reddish
orange
virtually
no
head
a
little
lacing
and
very
little
carbonation
smelled
of
hops
and
alcohol
with
some
light
malt
underneath
grapefruity
and
grassy
at
the
same
time
upfront
with
the
flavor
was
a
massive
hops
assault
but
following
closely
behind
was
a
bready
sugary
maltiness
a
little
grapiness
around
the
edges
just
a
hint
of
whats
to
come
as
it
warms
alcohol
definately
takes
over
but
by
the
time
this
happened
i
was
nice
and
warm
and
didnt
let
it
bother
me
full
bodied
mouthfeel
oily
but
not
bad
clingy
drinkable
yes
in
large
quantities
no
i
understand
why
foghorn
comes
in
smaller
bottles
besides
the
obvious
marketing
ploy
78
ounces
is
really
all
i
need
after
that
it
just
tasted
like
alcohol
anyway
also
i
probably
should
let
this
age
a
while
as
well
i
really
think
this
will
be
very
tasty
with
some
aging
hops
was
just
a
little
too
dominant
right
now
another
six
months
maybe
i
have
another
one
set
out
to
drink
fresh
and
the
other
four
are
in
my
cellar
aging
im
thinking
that
each
one
of
those
will
be
sampled
six
months
from
the
previous
sampling
meaning
ill
stretch
this
out
over
the
next
two
years
overall
impression
drinkability
at
first
i
had
some
trouble
enjoying
it
its
just
too
much
but
as
my
palate
warmed
thank
you
9
6
alcohol
i
started
to
mellow
and
just
enjoy
the
exuberance
toward
the
end
of
the
glass
im
thinking
i
could
do
another
but
the
amount
of
water
im
going
to
need
to
avoid
dehydration
is
probably
going
to
make
this
the
only
one
tonight
im
looking
forward
to
the
next
one
though
so
high
marks
i
also
want
to
age
it
a
bit
so
i
enjoy
the
first
few
sips
as
much
as
im
enjoying
the
last
ones
it
is
very
good
stuff
but
something
to
be
enjoyed
in
small
quantities
recommended
the
bigfoot
poured
a
hazy
reddishorange
with
a
thin
light
brown
creamy
head
that
had
good
retention
the
nose
was
alcohol
and
tart
fruitiness
with
some
hoppy
notes
the
taste
is
sweet
malts
up
front
with
a
strong
bitter
acidic
finish
with
some
citrus
tones
it
was
a
little
more
bitter
than
i
prefer
but
not
quite
as
overwhelming
as
the
celebration
it
had
a
thick
kind
of
oily
mouthfeel
drinkability
for
a
beer
this
strong
it
is
quite
drinkable
at
this
strength
it
only
gets
more
drinkable
the
closer
i
get
to
the
bottom
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
this
is
one
that
is
very
deceptive
the
abv
is
9
2
and
yet
definitely
does
not
taste
as
such
you
definitely
cannot
drink
this
one
all
night
but
it
tastes
great
and
i
look
forward
to
keeping
this
one
in
the
cellar
to
try
and
keep
trying
to
see
how
it
ages
in
my
notes
i
have
written
a
rose
of
leather
with
thorns
of
silk

strange
brew
indeed
but
ill
have
another
i
buy
a
case
of
this
stuff
every
year
and
save
two
bottles
hey
i
drink
alot
of
bigfoot
in
february
its
great
bigfoot
is
a
session
barleywine
it
sports
a
beautiful
clear
copper
color
and
a
great
irregular
lace
which
i
see
each
time
i
open
one
because
its
half
gone
before
i
look
at
the
glass
its
hoppy
but
balanced
and
that
shows
up
during
the
session
spending
time
with
this
beer
releases
all
its
flavors
ive
been
told
it
doesnt
age
well
it
changes
over
the
years
i
now
have
a
six
year
vertical
if
anyone
wants
to
get
together
ill
bring
mine
but
it
really
doesnt
make
any
difference
it
is
an
american
experience
it
is
very
drinkable
i
urge
you
to
make
it
a
session
beer
once
when
you
have
a
designated
driver
it
is
a
biggie
remember
thank
you
sierra
nevada
the
2004
lot
i
heard
alot
about
this
limited
released
brew
the
amber
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
made
for
a
nice
appearance
i
waited
for
the
head
to
settle
sticky
ring
lace
settles
on
the
glass
and
laces
all
brew
long
very
nice
the
aroma
is
a
slight
sweet
malt
with
stong
floral
hop
overtone
while
a
vapor
of
alcohol
hits
the
nose
the
taste
is
close
to
the
same
while
the
alcohol
is
more
concealed
a
good
but
strong
balance
of
the
hop
and
malt
the
hop
coats
the
mouthfeel
perhaps
hop
oil
as
it
lingers
on
awhile
drinkability
is
smooth
but
with
a
respectful
bite
ive
put
some
away
to
age
and
look
forward
to
see
how
they
mature
on
tap
at
bostons
time
to
have
one
as
winter
is
almost
ending
spring
is
approaching
dark
copper
to
ruby
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
this
beer
left
some
incredible
lace
in
the
glass
what
a
smell
hops
hops
and
malt
malt
what
a
big
beer
this
is
the
taste
is
a
roasted
sweet
malt
with
a
bitter
bitter
amount
of
hops
wow
this
beer
is
intense
i
rewally
could
not
finish
an
enitre
pint
not
because
it
wasnt
good
but
man
this
is
a
big
beer
this
is
a
beer
to
sip
in
front
of
the
fire
when
you
are
snowed
in
love
the
hops
medium
to
full
mouthfeel
as
far
as
drinkability
one
is
enough
great
beer
experience
it
does
a
good
job
of
blending
the
alcohol
content
without
completely
masking
it
very
enjoyable
overall
another
great
beer
from
sn
and
a
nice
addition
to
my
basement
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
against
2003
and
find
out
which
one
i
like
better
i
think
this
is
an
exceptionally
drinkable
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
anytime
drainkability
is
good
but
faily
acidic
finish
is
tough
to
take
over
extended
period
without
some
grub
not
as
dark
as
a
normal
barleywine
a
bigger
head
than
a
normal
barleywine
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
and
some
spice
but
for
the
style
has
the
volume
turned
down
the
flavor
is
less
disappointing
but
still
it
is
lacking
the
nerve
of
its
superiors
this
has
very
traditional
barleywine
flavors
but
it
not
as
bold
as
normal
i
hate
to
think
of
it
as
simply
a
strongale
for
the
masses
but
i
cant
hlp
myself
that
being
said
its
not
a
bad
beer
it
has
been
well
brewed
alot
of
effort
has
been
put
here
but
unfortunately
it
has
been
put
to
making
the
beer
well
accepted
i
just
prefer
a
barleywine
that
doesnt
accomodate
to
you
rather
one
that
makes
you
accomodate
to
it
ie
north
coast
or
stonedouble
bastard
if
you
want
to
call
the
latter
a
barleywine
which
i
dont
like
to
i
love
this
style
of
beer
so
i
may
be
picky
but
if
other
strong
ales
did
not
exist
i
would
be
reviewing
this
beer
highly
but
in
context
i
must
give
it
moderate
marks
drinkability
is
ok
this
really
needs
a
few
years
of
aging
i
will
locate
a
more
mature
bottle
and
rereview
this
taste
is
big
maltiness
of
course
but
quickly
the
hoppy
bitterness
muscles
in
there
floral
and
fruity
hops
flavors
as
it
warms
there
is
more
underlying
caramel
and
alcohol
flavors
present
especially
in
the
finish
bitter
hops
finish
and
a
sticky
malty
and
bitter
floral
aftertaste
a
bit
of
alcohol
burn
lingers
much
hoppier
than
i
remembered
but
i
havent
had
this
since
1997
or
so
very
smooth
good
sippin
brew
nice
drinkability
unbelievable
for
a
barleywine
although
it
does
have
lower
alcohol
than
all
other
barleywines
ive
had
the
alcohol
flavor
isnt
perceptible
at
all
drinkability
is
right
up
there
this
thing
is
going
to
rock
once
the
hops
settle
in
this
truly
is
a
world
classic
but
one
needs
to
be
patient
as
it
matures
drinkability
for
savoring
on
cold
winter
nights
ng
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
even
at
9
4
and
its
one
of
my
personal
faves
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
going
to
go
get
another
one
this
is
one
powerful
brew
i
think
its
a
little
young
at
this
point
might
be
more
balanced
with
some
time
still
an
incredible
tasting
brew
between
this
and
the
celebration
ale
sn
has
absolutely
blown
me
away
when
i
first
had
this
one
last
summer
it
sent
chills
down
my
spine
made
me
think
just
how
lucky
i
am
to
have
so
many
good
beers
in
my
time
a
fantastic
barleywine
and
proof
that
the
style
doesnt
have
to
be
an
abv
monster
to
impress
wellbalanced
and
warming
is
quite
enough
quite
good
and
now
that
its
out
for
2004
ill
be
having
more
of
this
the
drinkability
is
low
for
this
because
of
the
hop
lingering
aftertaste
and
the
alcohol
a
dark
cooper
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
leaves
very
pretty
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
a
nice
looking
barleywine
the
smell
is
exaclty
what
youd
expect
from
a
sierra
nevada
brew
spicey
hops
and
a
hint
of
pine
there
is
a
nice
blend
of
hops
and
malts
that
tickle
the
tastebuds
and
again
i
taste
a
little
bit
of
pine
the
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
by
the
other
flavors
a
bittersweet
flavor
that
is
very
drinkable
i
think
it
is
safe
to
say
i
fell
in
love
with
this
beer
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
loves
sierra
nevadas
products
and
i
wish
this
was
available
more
of
the
year
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
the
shelflife
for
this
powerhouse
brew
the
malt
complexity
was
amazing
with
fruit
grain
sweet
and
sour
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
was
like
pudding
it
went
down
real
easy
and
took
me
at
least
20
minutes
to
finish
the
maltines
came
throught
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
bit
of
spicy
cascade
hops
the
hop
finish
had
faded
from
the
fresh
taste
i
remember
from
an
earlier
tasting
the
swallow
had
it
all
a
lingering
malt
sweetness
great
mouthfeel
and
a
slow
transition
to
the
astringent
hoppiness
it
didnt
taste
strong
for
alchohol
but
after
just
one
i
had
a
definite
buzz
whoa
kick
me
in
the
butt
and
have
me
enjoy
it
too
cloudy
dark
brown
appearance
with
a
nice
head
and
great
lacing
smell
was
dintinctly
like
grapefruit
with
a
slight
yeasty
bouquet
the
smell
invited
me
to
drink
taste
was
a
blast
of
hops
that
slaps
you
in
the
face
says
sip
me
you
fool
then
ends
in
a
dry
grapefruit
citrus
finish
that
is
damn
nice
in
the
winter
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
the
strong
alcohol
presence
reminds
you
that
it
is
a
barleywine
so
sip
but
for
the
high
abv
i
thought
the
drinkability
was
fine
only
one
per
night
though
2002
vintage
brought
out
of
storage
in
jan
2004
notable
differences
more
head
less
sweetness
and
perhaps
some
subtle
fruit
esters
on
the
nose
this
brews
bitterness
can
be
overwhelming
when
young
its
best
to
cellar
it
for
several
months
to
a
year
and
beyond
if
you
can
keep
your
greedy
hands
off
of
em
2003
poured
a
deep
maduro
with
a
thin
head
smelled
of
the
typical
deep
sharp
sn
hops
and
then
a
whiff
of
the
alcohol
the
tase
was
right
on
slow
sippin
thoughtful
world
problem
solvin
goodness
a
moments
worth
of
slightly
sweet
malt
flavor
almost
like
dry
maple
then
came
the
full
hop
and
alcohol
assault
sharp
dry
cognac
like
flavors
big
head
filling
flavors
of
spice
wood
and
tobacco
what
a
well
balanced
mouthful
really
good
carbonation
balance
that
lasted
the
whole
glass
a
super
beer
that
packs
a
wollop
and
is
a
really
good
barley
wine
example
dark
copper
with
little
visable
carbonation
and
no
head
nose
features
forward
assertive
hops
and
caramel
malt
that
opens
up
around
midglass
alcohol
presence
is
quite
evident
as
well
piney
resinous
hops
with
an
almost
sugary
sweet
caramel
malt
character
sticks
out
more
in
this
aged
keg
than
they
do
in
younger
versions
notes
of
figs
and
currants
open
up
as
well
even
in
this
almost
two
year
old
version
the
raw
hop
presence
hardly
fades
while
the
malt
becomes
more
complementary
and
sweet
the
alcoholic
burn
on
the
finish
lingers
but
not
as
much
in
more
youthful
versions
mouthfeel
is
viscous
and
oily
yet
round
and
appropriately
carbonated
for
an
aged
draft
offering
fullbodied
and
assertive
bigfoot
at
this
point
in
its
life
is
still
one
of
the
hoppiest
barleywines
around
quite
drinkable
nonetheless
and
worthy
of
some
additional
aging
great
stuff
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
one
that
you
would
put
your
feet
up
and
unwind
to
watch
some
football
on
a
cold
winter
day
for
me
the
punch
from
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
forward
it
makes
it
somewhat
hard
to
enjoy
therefore
i
could
not
sit
and
enjoy
this
beer
all
day
i
will
try
the
other
3
at
the
9
12
and
1
year
3
month
mark
just
to
see
if
there
is
a
change
im
not
a
big
fan
of
barley
wines
but
bigfoot
easily
gets
my
vote
for
best
of
the
bunch
that
ive
tried
so
far
nice
tight
half
inch
head
that
reduced
so
a
sticky
lace
great
aroma
of
lots
of
sweet
caramel
and
fruity
malt
with
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
only
a
small
touch
of
spicy
hops
to
the
aroma
color
is
deep
copperbrown
and
slightly
hazy
a
large
amount
of
carbonation
can
be
seen
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
yet
theres
only
light
carbonation
on
the
tongue
the
palate
is
similar
to
the
nose
with
a
good
deal
of
caramel
and
fruity
malt
sweetness
the
alcohol
which
is
quite
obvious
is
in
no
way
awkward
in
its
tendency
to
stand
out
instead
it
melds
with
the
other
flavors
only
adding
to
the
overall
experience
decent
hop
bitterness
picks
up
toward
the
end
to
perfectly
balance
out
the
sweetness
from
the
start
theres
a
little
roastiness
to
the
finish
and
aftertaste
which
lingers
for
quite
some
time
easily
the
best
barley
wine
ive
had
to
date
and
ill
certainly
be
looking
for
this
one
again
edit
at
one
year
old
the
2004
diminishes
in
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
as
well
as
the
alcohol
flavor
it
becomes
much
smoother
but
the
finish
loses
some
of
its
character
excellent
so
overall
score
stays
the
same
but
i
tweaked
the
individual
category
scores
the
hoppiness
that
is
present
in
current
releases
is
much
mellower
and
tamed
from
aging
but
still
is
noticeable
the
smooth
flavors
lasts
long
into
the
aftertaste
and
the
alcohol
is
quite
noticeable
always
save
a
bottle
or
two
for
the
future
it
ages
well
101003
even
after
only
5
months
this
beer
has
mellowed
out
a
bit
that
plus
ive
been
exploring
some
ipas
this
summer
and
have
recalibrated
my
palate
a
bit
it
had
pretty
much
the
same
aroma
taste
was
about
the
same
except
i
noticed
a
cola
flavor
overall
the
hops
bitterness
got
toned
down
quite
a
bit
in
the
taste
and
finish
the
moral
of
the
story
is
this
beer
needs
to
be
cellared
if
youre
one
of
those
impatient
types
try
to
shop
at
a
place
that
doesnt
turn
these
over
so
quick
or
be
warned
the
consistency
is
amazing
from
year
to
year
if
you
get
it
fresh
the
ale
is
so
big
and
explosive
it
makes
you
literally
shake
your
head
and
call
a
friend
the
abw
ages
nicely
too
so
you
can
burn
the
candle
by
both
ends
just
an
amazing
ale
all
around
poured
a
chestnut
color
small
head
slight
raisany
taste
but
with
a
heavy
alcohol
backtaste
a
little
chocolate
came
in
at
the
end
the
aroma
and
taste
were
fine
but
there
was
just
to
much
of
an
alcohol
backkick
and
my
friends
pretty
much
agreed
with
me
on
this
the
best
strong
beers
shouldnt
be

the

comes
on
as

hops

of

on

still

a

probably
takes

you
may
be

i
have
no

his

will
mature
into
something

decent

abv
a
bit
of
a

reduces

i
am
writing
this
review
from
my
notes
bigfoot
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
barleywine
nice
malty
flavor
etc
etc
however
i
was
underwhelmed
by
it
after
reading
all
the
kudos
for
this
brew
on
the
web
in
newsgroups
i
was
expecting
to
have
my
socks
knocked
off
they
werent
its
a
good
barleywine
but
nothing
more
ive
been
buying
cases
of
this
beer
for
the
past
couple
years
and
aging
it
fresh
this
beer
is
stellar
aged
a
year
or
more
this
beer
is
heavenly
the
malt
and
hops
all
blend
together
perfectly
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
im
convinced
this
is
the
greatest
beer
being
brewed
period
first
sip
i
was
in
love
no
make
that
lust
i
will
scour
the
ends
of
the
earth
for
this
one
and
after
tasting
it
you
will
know
firsthand
just
why
that
is
if
you
are
a
fan
of
this
style
supreme
body
and
bursting
with
flavor
hops
malt
and
alcohol
all
the
things
that
make
the
barleywine
style
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
rather
one
that
is
uplifting
and
almost
spiritual
in
its
own
right
i
have
yet
to
find
another
example
of
this
style
that
has
the
flavor
abv
and
drinkability
of
this
fine
crafted
brew
do
not
pass
this
one
by
if
you
see
it
if
you
find
it
try
it
then
find
that
you
dont
like
it
email
me
and
i
may
just
buy
the
remainder
of
it
from
you

poured
this

into

20

and
i
couldnt
do
anything
but
sit
stare
and
smell
it
for
like
five
minutes
the
aroma
was
simply
amazing
i
could
literally
sit
here
all
day
and
enjoy
the
aroma
its
full
of
deep
invigorating
piney
hops
wrapped
in
maple
syrup
that
are
acting
like
pheromones
making
me
fall
in
love
with
this
beer
the
taste
is
one
huge
assault
of
malts
and
hops
the
hop
resins
send
shots
of
bitterness
across
my
palate
and
the
wave
of
malty
sweetness
of
figs
raisin
and
syrup
sweep
through

is
syrupy

the

in

very
nice
the
drinkability
of
a
beer
this
high
in
alcohol
is
so
dangerous
but
this
is
one
beer
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
its
an
experience
in
fact
its
one
that
i
would
like
to
have
again
i
will
tango

the

as
i

malty
with
some
fruit
flavors
that
i
cant
really
define
mouthfeel
is
creamy
at
first
but
leaves
the
mouth
a
bit
tingly
in
the
finish
flavor
is
fruity
strong
malt
and
a
mellow

bitter
but
the
alcohol
makes
its
presence
known
a
good
barleywine
but
not
as
smooth
or
full
of
character
as
i
expected
this
barleywine
takes
the
same
strands
and
ratios
of
hops
found
in
their
classic
pale
ale
and
balloons
their
presence
yet
it
is
still
unmistakeably
fruity
and
barley
hearty
in
other
words
it
does
a
great
job
even
though
it
is
on
a
far
extreme
of
the
style
i
e
the
hoppier
end
for
me
an
aged
bottle
would
undoubtedly
score
much
higher
in
flavor
im
so
glad
such
a
good
barley
is
so
available
and
so
cheap
being
a
fan
of
the
sierra
nevada
brewing
company
i
wasperhaps
expecting
something
of
the
caliber
of
their
celebration
ale
or
pale
ale
their
barley
wine
style
ale
provides
an
inviting
appearance
with
a
robust
brown
color
featuring
ruddy
highlights
as
well
as
a
complex
aroma
that
includes
scents
of
pepper
and
orange
an
odd
scent
which
transcends
as
hoppiness
in
the
flavor
is
probably
attributed
to
the
high
alcohol
content
that
comes
off
in
its
scent
and
amalgamates
into
the
bitterness
of
its
taste
therefore
the
taste
would
probably
be
improved
by
a
long
and
intense
breathing
session
or
storage
alone
as
many
advocates
have
suggested
a
chunky
mouthfeel
doesnt
help
culminating
in
a
less
than
spectacular
review
a
more
competent
review
could
be
submitted
within
a
year
after
giving
this
prestigious
label
an
opportunity
to
age
pours
with
a
dark
ruby
color
with
hints
of
orange
and
a
long
lasting
head
spicy
hop
aroma
a
lot
of
hops
especially
for
a
barleywine
the
taste
is
a
little
more
balanced
there
is
some
malt
sweetness
underneath
all
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
finishes
with
a
warm
alchohol
taste
a
year
or
two
of
cellaring
would
maybe
tame
this
beer
a
little
more
appears
chestnutdeep
garnet
in
color
with
a
very
creamy
tan
head
quite
a
thick
brew
hops
are
the
first
to
strike
me
in
the
aroma
also
a
roasted
maltness
appears
too
taste
is
thick
sweet
and
hoppy
there
is
a
distinct
malt
flavor
accompanied
by
a
strong
hops
presence
hops
are
the
theme
throughout
this
barleywine
quite
easy
to
drink
but
served
slightly
too
chilled
looking
forward
to
cellaring
the
other
five
a
very
hoppy
start
to
this
truly
marvelous
brew
alcohol
lets
its
presence
be
known
but
it
is
not
at
all
overwhelming
a
nice
amount
of
coffee
and
roastiness
comes
in
later
cherries
throw
themselves
in
there
as
well
this
is
one
incredibly
complex
beer
i
have
been
sitting
on
a
case
of
the
2002
for
a
while
and
i
will
surely
enjoy
every
last
bottle
the
carbonation
is
light
which
aids
in
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
that
warms
as
you
take
a
few
swallows
despite
the
high
alcohol
and
intense
array
of
flavors
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
cant
say
i
will
be
throwing
back
a
case
but
you
could
have
a
couple
which
is
very
impressive
for
the
style
a
good
barleywine
yet
again
sierra
nevada
proves
itself
i
look
forward
to
this
beer
every
year
and
use
it
as
a
benchmark
to
judge
other
barleywines
however
i
did
find
this
years
version
to
be
less
hoppy
than
what
i
remember
ill
have
to
pop
open
a
2002
bigfoot
that
ive
got
stored
away
to
compare
a
very
nice
barley
wine
that
would
be
terrific
with
a
few
years
of
age
on
it
while
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
feel
that
it
is
balanced
beautifully
a
little
celler
time
to
let
the
flavors
combine
and
intermingle
for
lack
of
better
terms
would
do
it
good
not
too
long
though
i
wouldnt
want
this
big
boy
to
mellow
out
too
much
pours
a
beauty
of
an
orange
bordering
light
red
in
color
the
initial
aroma
of
citrus
and
hops
prominent
of
grapefruit
this
is
a
smelly
beverage
a
taste
of
hops
up
front
followed
by
citrus
and
hops
leads
me
to
believe
this
could
pass
as
a
strong
ipa
here
the
citrus
does
come
in
near
the
end
but
the
hops
dominate
this
bad
boy
is
very
delicious
very
smooth
and
sweet
and
creamy
it
lives
up
to
its
reputation
nb
a
pre1983
to
1997
vertical
tasting
in
the
malt
advocate
determined
that
3
years
of
aging
was
the
pivotpoint
where
this
seemed
to
reach
its
optimal
condition
dantesmar
27
and
more
hops
seemed
to
be
the
leader
in
this
brew
the
flavors
become
more
pronounced
i
wouldnt
leave
it
sitting
out
around
the
campfire
too
long
of
it
will
disappear
a
big
beer
that
sneaks
up
on
you
like
the
elusive
bigfoot
in
the
woods
body
with
hoppiness
that
lasts
from
start
to
finish
relatively
sweet
at
the
start
quickly
dries
out
and
fades
to
a
warm
aftertaste
not
as
complex
and
balances
as

i
think
i
just
sat
here
and
took
in
all
the
aromas
for
2025
minutes
before
i
had
a
drink
this
is
probably
the
best
smelling
barley
wine
i
know
of
with
a
citrus
grapefruit
then
drys
out
to
a
tremendously
hoppy

it
doesnt

with
a
mildly
spicy
but
mostly
warming
alcohol
and
then
beneath
that
was
a
fruity
and
fruity
with
light
alcohol
and
hop
notes
it
smells
awesome
and
makes
my
mouth
water
just
anticipating
the
first
taste
the
taste
has
strong
alcohol
presence
and
fades
into
a
citrus
hopped
smack
right
in
the
tasters
the
light
biscuity
and
malty
taste
in
the
background
are
nice
to
be
able
to
detect
pine
this
full
bodied
brew
has
some
kick
i
havent
tried
many
barleywines
yet
so
i
was
not
even
going
to
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
when
it
came
in
at
my
local
beer
store
but
luckily
i
did
the
color
is
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
tan
creamy
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
beer
appears
slighly
cloudy
and
lower
in
carbonation
the
smell
is
of
hops

this
shall
be
done

wine
style
i
had
it

a

by
an
enormous
thick

this
beer
is
very
bitter
unlike
any
barley
wine
i
have
ever
had
lots
and
lots
of
hops
i
didnt
really
feel
too
guilty
about
taking
advantage
of
the
discount
i
recieved
all
they
had
to
do
is
go
to
the
cooler
and
check
the
price
and
has
only
improved
with
age
deep
burgundy
color
with
a
single
finger
tan
head
and
beautiful
with
some
caramel
and
a
slight
indication
of

the
finish
was
a
bit
bitter

so
far
this
is
best
one
i
have
tried
so

bottling
something
magical
has
happened
over
the
last
couple
months
my
2001
has
aged
and
mellowed
perfectly
the
trademark
hoppiness
is
still
there
1998
starts
out
nice
including
the
flavor
but
it
is
boozy
way
too
boozy
caged
and
corked
poured
into
tulip
glass
strong
whiskey
aroma
and
boozy
flavor
a
bit
too
much
sooo
good
smooth
smell
is
of
candied
rum
noticeable
alcohol
but
content
is
high
however
not
at
all
overwhelming
taste
is
sweet
dark
fruit
and
caramelized
malt
i
cracked
this
open
tonight
to
see
if
id
want
to
get
another
bottle
to
age
while
they
are
still
available
in
my
area
but
at
the
price
point
of
2022
per
bomber
im
not
sure
i
will
get
another
one
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
great
beer
worth
a
shot
especially
if
you
like
heavy
booze
in
your
barleywine
first
time
i
have
tried
this
a
10oz
glass
at
sn
taproom
bigfoot
hops
r
still
there
but
subdued
whiskey
barrel
taste
complements
the
bigfoot
flavor
perfectly
everything
is
in
balance
mod
malty
nose
with
whisky
barrel
aroma
nicely
in
step
mine
is
a
bit
cold
now
hides
its
alch
very
well
very
enjoyable
went
perfectly
with
dinner
d
this
was
a
solid
brew
that
smelled
amazing
like
coconut
cream
pie
the
taste
was
more
like
standard
bigfoot
with
a
bourbon
barrel
twist
the
body
was
solid
but
the
finish
was
hot
so
it
must
be
sipped
i
can
only
imagine
this
improving
with
age
a
shame
i
only
have
this
one
still
a
very
enjoyable
drink
fresh
this
is
an
excellent
brew
with
the
barrel
incorporated
carefully
to
add
to
vice
subtract
from
bigfoots
regular
character
drinks
alright
was
expecting
much
more
perhaps
tied
to
the
carbonation
got
better
as
it
warmed

disappointed

have

best

ive
had
this
year
almost
garnet

with
pecan

head
and
a
lace

rich
aroma
of
plums
mixed
with
butterscotch
caramel

booze
first
taste
is
surprise
grapefruit
followed
by
rich
toffee
and
finish
with
dark
fruity
wine
mouthfeel
is
buoyant
silky
smooth
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
very
smooth
awesome
mouth
feel
on
this
beer
and
its
fresh
not
aged
its
a
2015
it
would
like
velvet
in
my
mouth
after
a
couple
of
years
in
the
cellar
great
example
of
a
ba
american
barleywine
much
better
than
fresh
bigfoot
but
if
youre
not
into
bourban
aged
beers
this
isnt
for
you
o
glad
i
had
the
patience
to
let
it
age
a
whole
extra
month
after
purchase
ha
this
must
be
similar
to
what
an
aged
regular
bigfoot
is
like
with
some
added
bourbon
wood
notes
delicious
but
still
a
little
young
you
can
smell
the
bourbon
along
with
notes
of
coconut
and
slight
vanilla
the
taste
is
smooth
without
much
burn
primary
taste
is
coconut
followed
by
vanilla
and
a
little
dark
fruit
great
version
of
a
great
beer
cant
wait
till
next
year
when
i
open
my
second
i
passed
on
this
one
the
first
time
i
came
across
it
but
didnt
pass
on
it
this
time
glad
i
didnt
as
its
really
good
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
standard
bigfoot
barleywine
fresh
im
simply
not
a
fan
of
bourbonbarrelaged
american
barleywines
even
if
the
hops
dont
completely
overwhelm
any
barrel
notes
one
might
achieve
the
flavors
simply
dont
complement
each
other
very
well
i
think
english
barleywines
with
their
characteristic
caramel
sweetness
are
much
better
candidates
for
bourbonbarrelaging
this
beer
doesnt
taste
all
that
different
than
the
twoyearold
bigfoot
bottles
i
have
in
my
cellar
really
good
but
not
quite
as
good
as
fresh
and
not
nearly
as
good
as
i
hope
it
will
be
in
several
more
years
still
there
is
obvious
quality
and
complexity
here
and
i
can
definitely
taste
it
i
may
buy
another
bottle
of
this
in
couple
of
years
just
to
see
if
i
like
it
better
after
my
palate
has
developed
a
bit
more
o
a
nice
treatment
to
the
already
amazing
base
beer
the
barrel
character
definitely
imparts
itself
to
start
things
off
but
as
the
taste
flows
the
base
beer
shows
up
more
and
more
with
the
signature
bitterness
finally
showing
up
at
the
end
a
great
sipper
by
itself
as
well
as
trying
side
by
side
with
the
regular
definitely
worth
picking
up
for
the
right
price
full
bodied
and
creamy
with
low
carbonation
more
complex
by
far
than
the
regular
bigfoot
which
is
also
a
great
beer
im
glad
i
was
finally
able
to
get
a
couple
of
bottles
very
smooth
for
the
high
abv
but
it
loses
some
of
the
malt
kick
from
the
normal
variety
definite
bourbon
aroma
burnt
vanilla
and
cream
notes
with
a
kick
of
the
bourbon
at
the
end
not
too
much
beer
flavor
but
that
is
fine
not
every
brew
has
to
dialup
the
hops
malts
overall
damn
good
barley
and
barrel
treatment
overall
i
really
love
a
good
complex
challenging
ba
strong
ale
including
beers
that
started
off
extremely
hoppy
this
just
doesnt
quite
come
together
somehow
in
the
way
id
hoped
having
recently
had
aged
bigfoot
for
the
first
time
and
seeing
the
potential
i
may
grab
another
bottle
to
see
if
another
year
or
so
helps
this
realize
its
potential

i
found
this
to
be
a
perfectly
competent
even
very
nice
barrelaged
american
barleywine
but
in
terms
of
taste
and
certainly
value
id
always
choose
2
4packs
of
regular
bigfoot
over
one
bottle
of
this
thus
far
the
biggest
difference
between
smell
and
taste
for
a
beer
smells
quite
sweet
in
a
vanilla
caramel
way
like
a
really
nice
english
barley
wine
but
taste
is
much
hoppier
although
significantly
less
hoppy
then
regular
bigfoot
while
better
than
the
regular
bigfoot
i
prefer
my
barley
wines
to
be
sweeter
epic
ba
version
of
an
already
great
beer
enjoyed
with
some
beer
nerd
friends
and
this
was
a
big
hit
vanilla
bourbon
hop
caramel
and
malt
flavors
abound
overall
a
really
great
spin
on
a
classic
barleywine
the
bourbon
barrel
presence
is
strong
but
doesnt
overwhelm
the
complex
hop
and
malt
notes
nicely
complex
and
balanced
o
the
base
bigfoot
has
had
the
hops
tempered
down
a
couple
of
notches
while
the
time
in
wood
has
added
some
character
and
complexity
o
excellent
beer
this
reassures
me
that
i
need
more
ba
barleywines
in
my
life
wasnt
sure
i
liked
it
at
first
taste
but
it
definitely
grew
on
me
the
flavors
blended
the
longer
it
was
on
your
palate
nice
beer
silky
beer
strong
beer
overall
quite
a
nice
beer
not
so
sure
its
worth
the
20
price
tag
though
a
little
unbalanced
boozy
character
shows
though
id
like
a
little
more
backbone
not
bad
though
not
necessarily
an
improvement
over
regular
bigfoot
definitely
this
is
a
rather
woody
and
piney
sipper
this
sure
could
have
enjoyed
more
resting
time
2015
expedition
to
round
its
edges
the
hopiness
of
the
standard
bigfoot
is
greatly
diminished
and
is
replaced
by
a
sweet
heat
the
alcohol
is
quite
obvious
in
the
aftertaste
which
should
diminish
in
time
there
is
a
syrupy
sweetness
which
may
not
appeal
to
some
o
overall
this
is
very
good
i
had
avoided
getting
this
a
few
years
back
as
the
price
of
it
is
clearly
higher
than
the
standard
bigfoot
which
is
one
of
the
better
prices
for
what
was
a
6
pack
and
is
now
in
4
packs
unfortunately
this
year
i
wasnt
able
to
find
any
before
they
sold
out
of
inventory
from
my
locals
to
keep
the
vertical
going
the
body
was
thinner
than
i
like
in
a
bw
but
was
typical
for
the
base
beer
drinkability
was
hurt
by
the
overpowering
amount
of
booze
i
would
have
a
problem
finishing
a
pint
or
bottle
overall
while
not
a
bad
beer
in
the
technical
sense
this
was
an
unenjoyable
brew
for
me
ymmv
edit
i
forgot
to
mention
that
this
is
the
newly
released
2015
and
is
11
9
abv
and
as
the
beer
warmed
the
base
beers
hoppiness
came
through
bottle
label
55
this
was
probably
the
biggest
factor
in
me
deciding
to
pick
this
up
o
this
is
one
great
beer
the
bourbon
barrelaging
has
tamed
the
hop
bite
of
regular
bigfoot
and
enhanced
the
other
flavors
it
now
seems
like
a
cross
between
american
and
english
barleywines
ive
always
really
liked
bigfoot
and
this
version
takes
it
up
a
notch
or
two
impressive
really
sits
in
the
sweet
spot
for
my

drives
the

but
not
something
id
likely
by
again
at
the
current
price
point
poured
from
a

into
a

the
beer
is
a

no

more

this

very

big

somehow

the

all
booze
and

the

with

and
booze
heavy
surprisingly
delicate
with
the
barrel
aging
yet
strong
enough
to
be
throughly
enjoyable
with
each
sip
too
woody
this
was
an
intense
experience
one
im
glad
i
have
bigfoot
seems
like
a
natural
candidate
for
barrelaging
and
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
one
of
the
better
american
barleywines
around
if
it
even
still
is
around
at
all
this
is
just
awesome
deep
mahogany
almost
ruby
red
in
color
the
richest
of
ambers
hazy
but
not
dirty
looking
and
hanging
on
to
a
short
half
inch
of
just
off
white
bubbles
the
nose
is
great
still
hanging
in
there
with
bigfoots
characteristic
hop
intensity
but
its
mellowed
from
the
oak
and
from
the
first
whiff
an
intense
and
wonderful
barrel
character
is
evident
i
get
a
lot
of
vanilla
and
toasted
marshmallow
a
pronounced
nuttiness
maybe
almond
and
a
nice
molasses
sweetness
among
the
charred
oak
the
flavor
comes
in
waves
bigfoot
first
which
is
huge
for
me
in
barreled
beers
i
get
the
hops
in
the
middle
with
the
grain
before
it
the
grain
doesnt
provide
as
much
sweetness
as
the
whiskey
does
i
dont
think
but
all
the
nuance
is
wonderful
vanilla
for
sure
maple
syrup
brown
sugar
and
still
the
hops
which
play
well
with
the
oak
the
alcohol
is
invisible
even
at
ambient
temperature
and
the
carbonation
is
just
enough
to
keep
it
alive
and
moving
i
drank
this
way
too
fast
a
sign
of
how
elegant
it
is
really
and
a
testament
to
how
not
thick
it
is
not
syrupy
or
dense
or
even
filling
a
great
texture
in
a
style
that
is
usually
candy
teeth
i
dig
this
a
lot
extremely
impressed
by
its
degree
of
refinement
and
would
love
to
sit
on
a
bottle
of
this
for
awhile
although
the
hops
presence
makes
this
special
and
it
may
fade
off
in
time
truly
world
class
example
of
a
barrel
aged
strong
ale
o
saved
from
my
1500th
ba
review
this
was
a
let
down
as
the
wood
character
really
supplants
a
lot
of
what
makes
bigfoot
great
intense
caramel
and
toffee
maltiness
and
citrus
and
earthy
hoppiness
in
one
big
bodied
but
drinkable
package
the
tannins
and
oakiness
just
clouded
the
beer
for
me
o
a
forgettable
barrelaged
barleywine
not
really
worth
ticking
off
for
the
expense
of
getting
this
beer
overall
a
pretty
impressive
beer
the
barrelaging
tones
down
the
bitter
qualities
of
the
underlying
beer
o
a
perfect
sunday
sipper
note
2013
expedition
o
a
very
flavorful
boozy
beer
wish
the
alcohol
were
hidden
a
little
more
but
it
is
still
outstanding
id
imagine
this
one
would
only
improve
with
continued
aging
o
i
had
missed
out
on
buying
a
bottle
of
this
early
on
before
i
had
even
had
bigfoot
i
think
but
i
wasnt
shelling
out
16
for
a
750
back
then
then
i
heard
they
had
a
bottle
at
friscos
for
25
and
onsite
consumption
finally
it
just
randomly
popped
up
on
tap
at
maxs
for
a
sierra
nevada
pint
night
score
im
glad
i
didnt
bounce
on
the
other
opportunities
because
this
one
did
not
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
i
had
been
looking
for
it
for
a
while
and
it
was
subpar
my
friend
had
a
bottle
in
his
cellar
and
he
said
to
be
wary
and
that
it
wont
be
what
you
expect
and
he
was
right
save
your
money
and
just
age
a
case
of
regular
bigfoot
every
year
c
o
nice
i
love
aging
bigfoot
so
this
was
a
nice
take
on
it
same
lovely
amber
maple
syrup
hues
as
regular
bigfoot
with
a
smaller
off
white
crown
oaky
aroma
somewhat
muted
taste
taste
absolutely
magnificent
barrelaging
in
effect
vanilla
caramel
woody
hops
i
cant
recall
having
had
a
smoother
beer
it
coats
the
palate
with
all
those
flavors
thanks
to
the
subdued
carbonation
perhaps
its
because
i
know
and
love
the
base
beer
but
this
is
one
of
best
beers
ive
ever
had
kudos
sierra
nevada
please
make
it
available
every
once
in
a
while
paired
with
american
cuisine
hot
dogs
whole
wheat
penne
and
peas
left
over
from
feeding
the
kids
bigfoot
is
well
known
as
a
pretty
hoppedup
barleywine
however
i
thought
that
with
some
barrel
aging
and
time
the
hop
bitterness
would
mellow
out
thats
not
the
case
here
if
youre
into
hoppy
barleywines
definitely
search
this
one
out
if
you
want
something
deeper
and
sweeter
this
can
certainly
be
skipped
fairly
heavy
on
the
whiskey
barrel
and
caramel
sweetness
with
this
beer
excellent
sipper
overall
i
had
high
expectations
for
ba
bigfoot
and
they
were
met
if
youve
drank
a
lot
of
bigfoot
and
a
lot
of
barrel
aged
beer
you
should
have
a
pretty
good
idea
of
what
this
should
taste
like
as
is
so
often
the
case
with
sierra
nevada
the
finished
product
delivers
o
be
warned
this
is
a
completely
different
beast
compared
to
the
standard
bigfoot
expect
more
complexity
more
alcohol
and
more
sweetness
more
intensity
though
not
at
all
this
is
a
beer
that
shows
just
what
barrelaging
can
do
smooth
a
palate
or
rather
mellow
it
out
into
something
that
consists
of
only
one
overall
flavor
in
this
case
its
the
flavor
of
barrelaged
bigfoot
roasty
resinous
caramelsweetness
i
dont
know
if
i
can
handle
another
glass
of
it
but
i
sure
as
hell
want
one
overall
an
unmistakably
big
sipper
of
a
beer
from
sn
t
tastes
like
bigfoot
with
a
bit
of
barrel
to
it
i
was
surprised
my
how
hoppy
this
still
was
given
the
ba
timing
it
also
was
still
really
boozy
and
could
probably
use
some
time
to
mellow
out
pour
is
transparent
ruby
red
with
lots
of
a
tight

lots

some

and
a
chewy
feel
sierra
nevada
is
known
for
hop
forward
beers
and
this
beer
fits
the
prototype
poured
into
a
sample
glass
the
beer
was
a
murky
brown
color
it
produced
a
bourbon
aroma
with
notes
of
vanilla
and
dark
fruits
in
the
initial
taste
one
detects
notes
of
bourbon
vanilla
pungent
hops
and
a
warming
feature
the
warmness
continues
in
the
aftertaste
though
there
is
no
burn
from
the
alcohol
this
was
a
good
effort
for
sierra
nevada
but
the
hops
were
a
little
to
dominant
the
hops
even
intimidated
the
bourbon
to
an
unfair
degree
this
is
a
heavy
barleywine
that
should
stand
the
test
of
time
very
happy
i
got
my
hands
on
a
few
of
these
gems
ive
been
looking
forward
to
this
one
as
bigfoot
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
the
aroma
and
flavors
are
similar
but
very
different
the
whiskey
barrels
seems
to
bring
mostly
vanilla
and
fruit
but
not
much
whiskey
flavor
the
fruit
esters
were
unexpected
and
added
a
nice
touch
the
mouthfeel
was
extraordinary
not
as
complex
as
other
barrel
aged
beers
ive
had
but
this
is
still
awesome
received
in
trade
and
shared
with
friends
pours
a
medium
copper
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
rich
caramel
a
brown
sugary
malts
with
a
bit
of
faded
earthy
pine
and
citrus
with
a
very
nice
oak
and
vanilla
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
quite
well
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
creamy
syrupy
mouthfeel
fantastic
beer
i
enjoyed
every
bit
of
it
overall
this
could
use
a
few
years
to
kill
off
the
hops
otherwise
its
fantastic
d
dangerously
good
this
poured
out
as
a
mahogany
brown
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
no
retention
or
lacing
the
beer
appears
to
be
pretty
thick
due
to
the
syrupy
residue
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
pretty
boozy
definitely
a
high
octane
brew
with
the
help
of
that
barrel
aging
pouring
out
of
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
malty
sweet
its
got
some
bitterness
to
it
along
with
a
subtle
whiskey
flavor
in
the
mix
as
well
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
smooth
and
boozy
with
a
light
carbonation
overall
its
a
big
beer
and
sure
to
please
any
fan
of
the
regular
bigfoot
worth
trying
a
very
good
barleywine
spot
on
for
what
a
ba
barleywine
should
taste
like
but
still
there
are
a
lot
of
better
examples
out
there
that
offer
maybe
a
touch
more
complexity
o
fairly
good
drinkability
for
being
over
12
does
not
taste
that
strong
a
great
twist
on
an
old
classic
looking
forward
to
see
what
develops
a
few
years
from
now
overall
i
suppose
that
spirits
mellow
out
and
tone
down
the
maltiness
bring
out
a
sharp
finish
and
thus
thin
the
head
retention
so
barrelaged
bigfoot
isnt
as
sexy
as
the
base
counterpart
but
this
barleywine
is
perfect
in
every
other
attribute
similar
to
base
bigfoot
the
complexity
between
taste
and
scent
is
extraordinary
but
the
tonal
spiciness
from
barrel
aging
just
does
this
beer
wonders
a
beautifully
balanced
intelligently
complex
work
of
brewing
art
that
will
not
be
forgotten
d
nice
big
barrel
character
with
enough
balance
o
for
12
2
this
is
an
impressive
beer
because
as
boozy
as
it
is
theres
very
little
to
no
alcohol
burn
and
as
the
beer
sits
for
awhile
it
opens
up
and
mellows
bigfoot
is
decent
but
age
it
in
a
barrel
and
the
result
is
magic

this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
in
every
aspect
as
a
barrel
aged
beer
it
falls
nothing
short
of
its
promise
as
a
barleywine
i
like
mine
hoppy
strong
yet
sweet
this
one
is
lacking
on
the
hops
but
is
still
damn
close
to
perfect
as
a
barrel
aged
barleywine
it
is
delicious
a
12
abv
that
you
dont
realize
until
well
its
too
late
poured
into
rr
tion
glass
appearance
is
a
slightly
cloudy
auburn
with
a
centimeter
of
dense
white
head
which
leaves
heavy
lacing
the
nose
features
plenty
of
bigfoot
character
up
front
with
that
notable
earthy
hop
profile
which
is
paired
with
caramel
and
molasses
the
whiskey
comes
through
next
brings
ina
string
presence
of
vanilla
the
hops
are
also
very
present
on
the
finish
and
seem
like
they
may
clash
with
the
whiskey
the
taste
tells
a
different
story
though
the
hops
a
present
up
front
and
are
smoothed
out
by
a
hefty
dose
of
vanilla
and
oak
the
flavors
marry
together
quite
well
and
make
for
a
smooth
finish
mouthfeel
is
big
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
was
skeptical
about
such
a
hoppy
barleywine
being
barrel
aged
but
it
definitely
works
in
this
case
very
tasty
this
did
not
disappoint
huge
complexity
with
bold
flavors
only
making
a
great
beer
even
better
m
medium
to
full
body
creamy
light
carbonation
o
a
solid
beer
overall
but
a
bit
overwhelmingly
boozy
maybe
in
a
year
or
two
it
was
more
balanced
overall
after
sitting
in
my
fridge
for
maybe
three
weeks
i
decided
to
split
the
bottle
with
my
dad
and
what
great
move
to
drink
this
on
your
own
is
just
selfish
share
the
wealth
everyone
should
have
a
glass
salud
the
barrel
aging
adds
more
complexity
and
i
definitely
enjoy
the
aroma
more
if
youre
into
barrel
aging
like
i
am
think
youll
enjoy
the
added
complexity
this
is
not
my
favorite
barley
wine
every
year
but
the
aging
process
has
stepped
up
the
bigfoot
to
something
truely
amazing
the
big
abv
on
this
beer
is
masked
by
incredible
sweetness
and
coconut
flavors
the
medium
bodied
brew
gives
an
initial
taste
of
caramel
malt
and
slight
hop
bitterness
which
is
quickly
consumed
buy
the
sweeter
notes
imparted
by
the
barrel
aging
i
am
very
excited
to
try
my
second
bottle
in
a
year
or
so
if
i
can
wait
that
long
to
break
it
open
o
im
a
big
fan
of
bigfoot
but
im
not
sure
this
is
an
improvement
its
a
vastly
different
beer
the
barrel
aging
is
so
strong
and
pleasant
i
must
admit
it
obliterates
a
lot
of
the
base
beer
as
a
result
it
becomes
a
bit
unbalanced
i
must
say
having
said
that
this
is
still
delicious
especially
for
a
whiskey
lover
but
its
very
boozy
and
harsh
some
age
might
really
improve
it
i
think
not
that
regular
bigfoot
doesnt
improve
with
age
too
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
think
i
enjoy
regular
bigfoot
more
o
overall
a
nice
beer
though
i
didnt
think
it
was
a
big
improvment
on
the
base
beer
lots
of
whiskey
and
caramel
if
youre
one
of
those
people
who
love
the
normal
bigfoot
youll
probably
love
this
one
ive
always
thought
bigfoot
was
very
good
but
not
great
and
would
say
the
same
with
this
have
a
bottle
of
this
and
plan
on
sitting
on
it
for
a
while
poured
into
a
maudite
snifter
pours
a
deep
mahogany
amber
with
a
fine
one
finger
light
tan
head
with
great
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
aroma
dominated
by
whiskey
with
light
citrus
hops
and
caramel
malt
flavor
is
well
integrated
caramel
malt
light
piney
hops
vanilla
mild
oak
and
lots
of
nice
whiskey
excellent
medium
to
heavy
creamy
body
flavors
are
considerably
muted
from
fresh
bigfoot
but
the
time
in
the
barrel
has
melded
the
flavors
into
a
rich
malty
whiskey
infused
whole
with
hints
of
the
original
hops
very
nicely
done
for
lovers
of
whiskey
barrel
aged
ales
very
nice
would
be
curious
to
see
how
this
beer
tastes
with
a
couple
of
years
of
bottle
age
on
it
750ml
bottle
15
i
was
excited
to
get
a
bottle
because
i
heard
only
20
cases
came
to
co
i
also
remember
liking
this
when
i
had
a
taste
at
gabf
five
or
six
years
ago
unfortunately
this
one
was
a
real
disappointment
for
me
appearance
was
about
identical
to
regular
bigfoot
ruby
red
but
less
head
than
the
regular
the
aroma
was
quite
nice
good
whiskey
and
barrel
coming
out
of
the
bottle
and
my
glass
the
flavor
was
just
a
mess
for
me
huge
bitter
hops
conflicted
with
whiskey
flavors
and
then
heavy
brown
sugar
just
messy
i
think
my
real
problem
was
that
the
beer
just
had
too
much
bitterness
that
in
my
opinion
does
not
work
well
with
the
whiskey
barrels
i
would
not
purchase
this
again
but
if
barrel
aged
narwhal
comes
out
whew
overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
classic
beer
becoming
more
iconic
to
me
its
obvious
the
larger
craft
breweries
sn
and
sa
are
struggling
to
stay
pace
with
the
more
extreem
ever
changing
craft
beer
world
i
recently
have
ba
ovilla
and
it
was
awesome
i
hope
this
becomes
a
year
round
brew
m
full
bodied
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
theres
just
not
really
much
here
its
a
fiery
alcohol
laden
canvas
that
hasnt
had
a
bad
modern
painting
splashed
on
it
mediocre
pours
just
like
regular
bigfoot
deep
ruby
with
a
small
slightly
off
white
head
smells
of
piney
hops
and
some
slight
whiskey
taste
is
hop
forward
with
that
great
bigfoot
malt
bill
complimented
very
nicely
by
a
slight
vanillamarshmallow
aftertaste
and
some
decent
alcohol
heat
the
barrel
doesnt
overpower
the
base
beer
it
is
pretty
much
the
perfect
blend
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
a
barleywine
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
regular
bigfoot
is
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
and
i
had
thought
that
there
was
no
room
for
improvement
but
this
has
taken
me
by
suprise
sierra
nevada
has
done
wonders
for
the
craft
beer
community
for
decades
and
this
is
just
another
great
example
of
them
pushing
into
the
future
the
ironic
thing
is
this
really
doesnt
taste
much
different
than
regular
bigfoot
to
me
with
perhaps
just
a
hint
of
slightly
more
caramel
otherwise
this
isnt
something
that
is
doing
much
for
me
o
i
love
bigfoot
and
i
was
excited
to
get
a
few
bottles
of
this
this
is
a
phenomenal
variation
from
the
original
that
time
in
the
barrel
imparted
a
remarkably
balanced
and
complex
flavor
profile
full
of
vanilla
whiskey
and
appropriately
sweet
malts
fruits
there
is
a
bit
of
heat
but
i
rather
enjoyed
that
despite
consuming
the
entire
12
2
abv
bottle
i
never
grew
tired
of
this
beer
in
fact
i
could
have
gone
for
another
pour
i
am
glad
i
picked
up
multiples
of
this
beer
i
will
hang
on
to
one
to
see
how
it
ages
but
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
fantastic
fresh
beer
hopefully
this
will
be
much
easier
to
get
once
the
nc
brewery
is
up
and
running
d
there
are
many
beers
that
dont
do
well
with
bourbon
aging
this
isnt
one
of
them
if
you
like
bigfoot
then
you
should
buy
copius
amounts
of
this
if
given
the
chance
overall
this
style
is
a
good
one
especially
for
a
hop
lover
which
i
am
not
necessarily
i
would
definitely
buy
again
overall
a
very
very
interesting
beer
i
knew
drinking
this
one
fresh
out
of
the
barrels
would
be
an
interesting
experience
the
time
in
the
barrels
has
really
given
bigfoot
a
big
change
the
flavor
profile
is
much
different
less
hoppy
more
malty
boozy
but
there
are
still
some
remnants
of
it
left
in
this
one
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
i
can
only
imagine
how
incredible
it
can
get
with
a
couple
years
on
it
i
cant
give
it
a
bad
review
ugh
should
anyones
second
review
be
bad
but
simply
warn
yall
that
this
isnt
a
nice
easy
to
love
kind
of
beer
it
has
its
challenges
served
from
tap
into
a
raleigh
rare
vintage
beer
tasting
snifter
poured
redorange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
earth
citrus
hop
caramel
hop
vanilla
and
wood
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
vanilla
caramel
hop
earth
citrus
and
sweet
alcohol
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
nose
on
this
one
definitely
stood
out
over
the
regular
version
of
this
brew
with
the
addition
of
vanilla
and
subtle
oakiness
on
top
of
an
already
solid
aroma
hard
to
beat
that
if
im
honest
the
rest
of
the
brew
was
very
solid
for
the
style
and
quite
easy
to
drink
despite
the
abv
even
the
alcohol
that
was
present
in
the
flavor
was
very
well
integrated
to
the
point
that
you
wouldnt
even
notice
it
unless
you
were
truly
looking
for
it
a
really
well
done
barrel
treatment
to
an
already
solid
brew
cant
go
wrong
with
that
while
it
was
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
it
was
still
very
enjoyable
perhaps
it
is
the
boltcutter
effect
but
i
thought
that
ba
bigfoot
would
be
an
all
out
flavor
assault
and
completely
lacking
in
subtlety
far
from
it
this
beer
was
rather
mellow
and
never
overpowering
the
flavor
of
the
whiskey
barrel
rather
than
the
intensity
and
the
heat
was
most
noticeable
i
like
what
sn
did
with
this
i
hope
they
continue
with
this
annual
release
othe
coconut
was
too
much
for
me
wanted
more
bourbonoak
and
caramel
maybe
age
will
do
this
some
good
o
taking
a
iconic
beer
such
as
bigfoot
and
giving
it
the
barrel
treatment
seems
like
a
big
yet
necessary
step
for
sierra
nevada
which
resulted
in
a
terrific
contrast
to
the
yearly
release
and
is
quite
a
pleasure
to
drink
sideby
side
with
the
normal
one
its
most
noticeable
variance
is
obviously
the
whiskey
but
also
the
stark
lack
of
hops
seemingly
overpowered
by
its
time
in
the
barrel
this
potent
older
brother
to
bigfoot
is
a
welcome
addition
to
sierras
offering
which
will
hopefully
return
with
more
availability
poured
from
bottle
into
wine
glass
at
avenue
pub
nola
pours
a
syrupy
brown
with
reddish
hue
not
any
head
but
some
lacing
is
present
big
sweet
syrup
molasses
malty
booze
aroma
lots
of
whiskey
notes
and
dried
cherry
taste
is
sweet
dried
fruity
malty
all
kinds
of
flavors
here
some
tobacco
and
vanilla
woody
shine
its
soooo
smooth
its
almost
unbelievable
i
could
basically
chug
this
wow
what
a
fantastic
barleywine
51
overall
this
is
quite
tasty
and
the
barrelaging
fans
should
love
it
drink
this
badboy
near
room
tempature
opens
very
nicely
and
has
a
wonderful
array
of
deep
flavor
its
certainly
one
of
the
top
ba
bwines
imo
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
direction
my
other
babf
goes
in
after
5years
highly
recommended
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
turned
extra
amazing
pours
a
clearish
ruby
amber
with
a
transient
light
cream
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
collar
and
no
lace
aroma
of
whiskey
and
um
whiskey
and
pine
sap
maple
oak
and
oppression
flavor
is
sweet
and
oaky
doesnt
really
taste
like
bigfoot
just
straight
whiskey
and
wood
sweet
and
syrupy
burnt
and
toasted
piney
hops
and
awww
hell
who
cares
very
raw
oaky
hoppy
and
woodsy
even
oaked
horizontal
was
more
interesting
than
this
seriously
whats
the
point
of
this
mess
make
no
mistake
the
barrel
added
to
the
intensity
of
this
beer
the
barrel
did
not
however
tone
down
the
beast
only
changed
the
hairdoo
this
beer
is
fucking
hardcore
i
am
really
surprised
it
was
in
the
barrel
for
over
a
year
as
the
beer
still
seems
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
something
i
respect
in
a
fresh
bigfoot
but
with
the
added
potential
the
whiskey
barrel
added
to
the
overall
depth
o
wanted
to
try
a
bottle
of
this
fresh
as
i
love
fresh
bigfoot
in
its
standard
incarnation
although
being
aged
in
a
barrel
for
an
extended
time
probably
doesnt
qualify
this
as
truly
fresh
and
its
big
hop
profile
that
dies
over
time
despite
these
feelings
before
drinking
this
i
was
figuring
that
this
version
would
probably
go
against
this
and
be
better
with
some
age
after
drinking
this
bottle
i
think
that
is
probably
correct
not
bad
now
but
a
bit
disjointed
and
unbalanced
i
think
as
this
ages
the
whiskey
will
smooth
out
and
the
hops
will
fade
more
and
this
should
transform
into
a
much
more
balanced
and
better
beer
as
suspected
my
other
bottle
will
be
sitting
in
the
cellar
for
a
while
to
see
what
happens
with
this
over
time
o
what
a
beast
this
brew
is
a
monster
there
is
so
much
activity
going
on
that
has
blown
up
exponentially
from
the
whiskey
barrels
detailed
work
that
produced
an
excellent
product
i
would
have
expected
nothing
less
from
sierra
nevada
o
id
use
this
as
a
classic
example
of
style
for
an
oak
aged
beer
as
the
barrel
aging
of
strong
yet
the
barleywine
flavors
are
clear
and
the
overall
flavors
are
balance
and
complementary
overall
i
was
very
happy
with
this
beer
the
alcohol
while
very
high
was
not
too
dominant
in
the
flavor
and
it
was
unique
for
sure
this
is
definitely
a
really
good
beer
the
barrel
notes
already
seem
to
be
well
integrated
already
and
it
compliments
the
already
great
base
beer
nicely
as
mentioned
the
carbonation
is
high
for
the
style
and
it
sort
of
throws
the
mouthfeel
off
a
bit
for
me
id
like
to
see
this
beer
down
the
road
to
see
what
comes
of
it
feel
is
good
beer
good
overall
id
love
to
give
this
a
taste
a
year
or
two
down
the
road
but
i
can
dig
it
for
what
it
is
well
done
sierra
nevada
my
favorite
750ml
beer
from
them
in
recent
memory
o
truly
phenomenal
one
of
the
most
exciting
beers
ive
tried
in
recent
memory
highly
recommended
im
rather
surprised
of
how
much
the
barrels
diealed
down
the
hops
and
rounded
out
the
malts
to
sherrylike
or
portlike
savoriness
and
complexity
but
with
the
influx
of
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
i
have
become
accustomed
to
expect
more
bourbon
character
than
this
simplified
whisky
flavor
provided
even
still
its
a
world
class
barleywine
that
more
resembles
english
versions
than
the
standard
bigfoot
provides
o
not
so
impressed
by
the
bottle
a
but
thin
overcarbed
a
light
astringency
and
ultimate
letdown
compared
to
then
draft
version
it
reminded
me
of
ba
old
ruffian
to
a
deree
and
thats
not
a
positive
the
nose
is
similar
to
the
original
only
in
the
background
right
up
front
it
is
definitely
barrel
aged
bourbon
vanilla
toasted
coconut
oak
caramel
molasses
a
hint
of
piney
hops
and
some
booziness
the
bourbon
barrel
comes
forward
really
strong
in
the
taste
toasted
coconut
oak
bourbon
caramel
pine
hops
vanilla
some
citrus
and
sweet
roasted
caramel
malts
i
like
the
more
pronounced
malts
of
the
barrelaged
version
as
opposed
to
the
standard
bigfoot
the
hops
are
much
more
muted
and
subtle
medium
to
full
body
low
but
proper
carbonation
very
smooth
not
too
boozey
and
a
sweet
somewhat
chewy
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
whereas
the
original
is
a
bit
rougher
in
my
opinion
in
the
end
i
am
having
a
hard
time
separating
what
i
paid
for
the
beer
along
with
the
rareness
as
i
rate
the
beer
this
is
a
delicious
beer
but
i
dont
think
it
is
a
truly
great
beer
o
this
was
like
an
old
friend
who
you
respect
as
a
cook
and
lets
you
try
something
that
wasnt
quite
as
good
as
what
he
or
she
made
recently
but
you
can
tell
they
are
experimenting
are
their
proud
of
it
i
respect
this
beer
and
sierra
nevada
for
making
it
oa
nice
variation
of
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
plenty
of
caramel
still
runs
through
the
mouthfeel
but
the
hops
are
so
far
downplayed
on
the
flavor
list
you
still
cant
believe
this
is
bigfoot
its
robust
and
strong
i
dont
want
to
say
boozy
but
this
is
never
going
to
be
mistaken
for
a
session
ale
either
i
was
pretty
impressed
and
im
sure
ill
save
a
bottle
or
two
to
drink
in
2020
or
whatnot
down
the
road
a
nice
addition
to
regular
bigfoot
although
the
whiskey
barrel
aging
made
this
one
quite
hot
and
somewhat
difficult
to
easily
drink
hopefully
this
one
will
become
more
readily
available
because
id
like
to
pick
up
a
few
more
and
age
them
to
see
if
it
blunts
the
heat
a
little
thanks
again
to
jeff
for
this
one
overall
definitely
a
blast
to
try
i
love
bigfoot
and
seek
it
out
each
year
this
is
definitely
a
treat
to
get
my
hands
on
a
bottle
not
sure
how
this
would
age
but
may
give
it
a
whirl
if
i
can
score
another
bottle
overall
i
prefer
this
beer
to
kbs
and
i
love
breakfast
stout
this
beer
is
not
a
novelty
it
is
balanced
to
perfection
and
the
whole
concept
was
executed
perfectly
keep
in
mind
ive
only
had
510
whiskey
barrel
aged
beers
but
ive
had
my
fair
share
of
barleywines
including
aged
bigfoots
this
beer
is
on
a
very
high
level
o
the
abv
never
makes
itself
known
but
someone
put
whiskey
in
my
bigfoot
and
i
like
it
o
this
is
a
solid
ba
barleywine
i
was
hoping
for
better
but
it
just
doesnt
seem
like
whiskey
and
bigfoot
are
a
perfect
combo
the
beer
is
well
made
and
well
blended
i
think
on
slight
downfall
is
the
quality
of
whiskey
while
the
whiskey
is
prominent
in
this
beer
its
no
pappy
regardless
it
is
a
good
beer
that
just
didnt
quite
pan
out
perfectly
o
overall
as
advertised
bigfoot
in
a
whiskey
barrel
it
is
a
winner
paint
me
impressed
overall
i
really
thought
that
the
barrel
did
wonders
to
this
beer
and
really
added
some
nice
new
dimensions
to
the
base
beer
i
got
the
really
nice
background
sherry
and
medicinal
tones
of
23
year
old
bigfoot
along
with
really
nice
barrel
character
it
didnt
feel
muddled
as
i
thought
it
might
with
the
combination
of
the
hops
and
the
barrel
well
done
i
will
be
looking
to
get
a
bottle
or
two
to
see
how
this
evolves
over
time
o
a
great
barleywine
complex
and
hearty
strong
and
only
semisweet
sweeter
than
the
normal
bigfoot
but
not
overly
sweet
the
bitter
hops
leaft
a
great
aftertaste
between
sips
reminded
me
of
american
and
english
strong
alesold
ales
definitely
something
to
buy
again
if
spotted
o
nice
tasty
barley
wine
i
really
prefer
the
original
due
to
the
lack
of
hops
goodness
but
it
was
a
special
treat
to
have
for
sure
cheers
this
beer
capped
off
a
vertical
tasting
of
bigfoot
from
2007
to
2013
by
this
point
we
were
pretty
much
palatefatigued
but
this
beer
really
made
everyone
sit
up
and
take
notice
the
aroma
is
immediately
striking
with
its
strong
whiskey
notes
two
years
in
the
barrel
really
imparted
a
strong
character
same
goes
for
the
taste
its
bigfoot
but
wrapped
up
in
whiskey
barrel
goodness
never
too
much
of
the
barrel
though
really
the
balance
is
exceptional
in
how
they
managed
to
deliver
the
best
of
both
worlds
the
oaky
vanilla
also
nicely
plays
with
the
flavors
barrel
aged
bigfoot
was
the
star
of
the
show
as
we
all
thought
it
was
the
most
enjoyable
beer
of
the
bunch
i
feel
lucky
to
have
tried
this
special
release
a
nice
new
take
on
bigfoot
the
whiskey
compliments
as
supposed
to
competes
its
definately
worth
a
try
if
you
can
land
a
bottle
o
couldnt
believe
when
my
dad
showed
up
at
my
doorstep
in
ohio
this
morning
and
told
me
he
came
across
a
bottle
of
this
in
indiana
i
truly
owe
him
as
this
one
was
worth
the
hype
thanks
pops
great
balance
of
flavor
smell
and
body
maybe
i
shouldnt
have
drank
this
two
hours
before
the
um
vs
indianer
gamewhoo
it
knocked
me
back
a
little
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass

deep
burgundy
with
a
nice
tight

finger
white

atopgreat
rich
clarity
big
hop
resins
mixed
with
toasted
oak
in
the
noseas
it
warms
whiskey
gets
bigger
and
bigger
the
whiskey
barrel
is
really
big
on
the
palate
but
the
powerful
hops
acts
as
a
counter
balance
wich
doesnt
happen
much
with
barrel
aged
beersvanilla
and
dark
fruit
round
out
the
flavor
profile
this
is
a
deeply
consentrated
flavorful
beerthe
hops
are
huge
for
something
that
has
sat
for
a
yearbut
the
aging
makes
it
complex
to
the
hilt
thanks
to
roger
at
bestway
for
hookin
me
up
thisit
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
to
say
the
least
this
one
is
just
not
for
me
jmo
overall
this
beer
was
amazing
everything
i
had
hoped
it
could
be
definitely
gonna
try
to
seek
out
more
of
this
to
see
how
it
is
with
some
more
age
on
it
bottom
line
if
you
like
boozebombs
open
one
of
these
asap
otherwise
id
suggest
sitting
on
this
for
a
while
before
opening
definitely
has
potential
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
toffee
whiskey
and
wood
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
hoppy
finish
and
an
alcohol
kick
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
great
smell
and
a
hoppy
flavor
i
wasnt
quite
expecting
from
a
barrel
aged
beer
hoping
i
am
in
the
right
place
for
this
beer
as
it
it
appears
i
am
the
first
to
review
the
newly
released
750
bottled
version
a
slow
hiss
as
i
pull
the
cork
this
brew
pours
a
brilliant
amber
ruby
hue
with
a
beige
finger
of
creamy
foam
stunning
looking
the
nose
is
a
beauty

also
bright

along
with

and
booze
soaked

very
complex
on
the
nose
with
a
lot
of
booze
as
well
the
taste
is
not
quite
to
the
level
of
the
nose
with
the
alcohol
hiding
up
some
more
of
the
noses
nuanced
characteristics
brings
oloroso
sherry
rye
whiskey
as
well
as
irish
whiskey
somehwhat
grainy
and
drying
the
finish
is
somewhat
tannic
and
very
boozy
cannot
imagine
how
amazing
this
will
be
in
two
years
after
having
time
to
mellow
and
all
the
flavors
to
integrate
o
i
came
to
this
event
specifically
for
this
beer
and
to
donate
to
toys
for
tots
it
was
totally
worth
it
and
this
beer
surpassed
my
expectations
which
were
already
high
a
very
special
beer
talked
to
the
local
sn
rep
who
said
this
is
the
beer
that
is
going
into
bottles
in
early
2013
went
into
barrels
in
2010
specifically
stranahan
jim
beam
and
heaven
hill
supposedly
a
mistake
but
they
went
with
it
for
the
30th
anniversary
of
bigfoot
this
year
amazing
stuff
d
strong
but
strong
is
good
if
you
wanna
go
to
a
kegger
and
dont
wanna
drink
shit
beer
but
still
be
on
the
same
wavelength
as
the
other
folks
a
sixer
of
this
will
suffice
youll
be
wankered
without
the
bonging
or
beer
games
drink
up
i
actually
moved
back
to
my
small
home
town
and
this
is
the
best
beer
they
have
to
offer
at
the
lq
outstanding
for
the
style
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
brownishred
with
a
small
layer
of
foam
with
a
complex
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
hops
as
well
tastes
rather
astringent
with
lots
of
fresh
hops
and
a
nice
bitter
finish
strong
with
good
carbonation
great
body
hearty
and
drinkable
great
for
sippin
to
me
and
i
love
huge
huge
flavorful
beers
the
barrel
just
needed
to
be
turned
down
a
notch
so
this
exceptional
brew
gets
to
show
itself
off
a
bit
more
2013
bottle
whiffs
of
coconut
big
brown
sugar
and
caramel
wet
wood
lingering
bitterness
lots
of
dry
oak
traces
of
dry
piney
hops
from
the
base
beer
the
sierra
nevada
brewery
is
an
amazing
place
to
sample
beers
they
always
have
ones
that
you
have
never
seen
in
the
store
or
have
never
heard
of
last
night
i
had
wood
barrel
aged
bigfoot
it
was
aged
in
a
whiskey
barrel
so
it
ended
up
being
12
5
and
it
had
a
nice
taste
of
whiskey
at
the
end
d
there
are
many
beers
that
dont
do
well
with
bourbon
aging
this
isnt
one
of
them
if
you
like
bigfoot
then
you
should
buy
copius
amounts
of
this
if
given
the
chance
i
was
very
excited
to
try
this
so
maybe
my
expectations
were
a
little
high
and
im
a
little
over
critical
i
always
dreamt
of
what
bigfoot
would
taste
like
barrel
aged
probably
more
so
than
any
other
beer
i
think
if
it
would
have
stayed
closer
to
the
original
abv
and
maybe
a
little
longer
in
the
barrel
it
would
have
reached
perfection
as
it
was
though
it
was
an
amazing
beer
that
i
was
more
than
glad
to
have
consumed
i
hope
i
get
a
second
chance
with
this
one
some
day
this
seems
to
have
aged
well
it
is
smooth
wellbalanced
and
free
of
any
musty
or
other
off
characteristics
two
years
seems
like
a
sweet
spot
on
this
one
though
at
10
6
abv
it
could
probably
do
2
more
and
still
be
delicious

cheers
o
overall
a
really
good
american
barleywine
no
barleywine
is
easy
to
drink
but
this
is
among
the
easier
of
the
type
to
sip
im
certainly
going
to
sleep
well
tonight
excellent
pale
to
crystal
malt
base
theres
also
an
excellent
hop
counterpoint
that
creates
balance
and
interest
creamy
full
body
but
the
carbonation
fits
for
this
beer
simply
put
this
is
hoppy
barley
wine
that
the
masses
could
enjoy
actually
this
is
my
favorite
barleywine
that
i
recall
nice
balanced
even
no
serious
edges
as
i
recall
in
my
area
it
was
also
less
expensive
for
a
bomber
than
most
i
dont
recall
the
price
sorry
o
fitting
for
the
american
barleywine
category
at
least
this
sample
though
i
have
had
some
aged
and
it
really
mellows
out
quite
nicely
this
is
hop
forward
and
hot
but
is
still
very
drinkableenjoyable
taste
was
a
little
less
complex
than
some
other
examples
but
overall
a
well
executed
barleywine
i
do
have
at
least
one
of
these
every
year
and
i
will
continue
the
trend
o
an
excellent
barleywine
my
only
complaint
would
be
it
was
a
bit
hot
in
the
alcohol
department
this
is
one
that
would
be
even
better
after
some
cellar
time
i
suspect
an
exemplary
barleywine
and
i
should
have
expected
no
less
from
smuttynose
o
i
was
happy
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
this
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
enjoys
the
style
a
more
muted
form
of
bigfoot
if
i
had
to
compare
it
with
another
overall
i
was
rather
impressed
this
is
a
very
smooth
hoppy
barleywine
and
for
under
7
dollars
a
bottle
worth
picking
up
overall
this
beer
will
become
much
more
userfriendly
with
a
year
or
two
of
age
on
it
but
right
now
it
is
brash
and
abrasive
at
11
apv
depending
on
year
not
sure
about
this
bottle
conditioned
2013
strong
but
alcohol
is
not
noticable
beer
adv
review
says
7
its
clearly
not
and
is
11
as
details
above
say
overall
every
barleywine
ive
had
is
unique
and
this
one
continues
the
trend
its
delicious
malty
smooth
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
entirely
awesome
job
not
that
id
expect
anything
less
from
smuttynose
pours
out
a
really
nice
maroon
in
color
with
a
great
two
finger
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lots
of
good
lacing
smell
is
really
sweet
with
nice
candy
sugars
lots
of
caramel
hops
that
give
you
great
sugar
a
little
bit
a
of
dark
fruits
and
a
little
bit
of
toffee
taste
is
really
sweet
as
one
would
expect
but
there
is
also
a
little
bitter
hops
that
werent
present
in
the
nose
that
add
to
the
complexity
really
a
nice
barley
wine
as
there
is
some
balance
with
the
hops
that
i
typically
dont
see
in
this
style
mouth
fell
is
really
pretty
thick
that
goes
with
the
style
i
really
like
this
as
there
are
a
lot
of
things
going
on
here
that
meld
together
that
i
dont
typically
see
in
this
style
overall
a
really
big
beer
that
makes
me
want
more
as
this
beer
brings
balance
that
you
normally
dont
see
in
the
style

the

and
very

great
complex
brew
overall
this
one
certainly
fulfills
the
big
beer
series
name
a
bit
rambunctious
now
this
one
will
benefit
with
age
pick
one
up
if
youre
not
scared
of
something
strong
great
contrast
of
malt
and
hops
well
balanced
in
extremes
with
enough
flavoring
hops
to
keep
things
interesting
this
would
probably
age
well
the
taste
is
definitely
malt
and
fruit
forward
but
at
the
same
time
not
in
your
face
light
to
medium
bitterness
unlike
other
fresh
barleywines
i
have
tried
this
one
is
not
a
puckerup
malt
explosion
it
feels
like
it
has
already
cellared
and
mellowed
for
a
year
nicely
done
smuttynose
o
fresh
this
is
a
solid
brew
it
could
use
a
few
months
to
a
year
of
age
which
would
mellow
out
the
alcohol
a
little
and
really
help
to
showcase
the
maltiness
a
bit
more
cant
really
beat
the
price
point
either
which
is
the
case
with
all
of
the
smuttynose
big
beer
series
overall
a
very
good
barleywine
will
only
improve
with
age
the
smuttynose
big
beer
series
are
always
so
solid
and
come
at
a
great
price
d
overall
this
is
a
great
drink
probably
got
a
bit
boozier
of
time
so
i
suggest
letting
it
sit
for
a
year
or
two
great
sweet
and
bitter
hop
balance
overall
mellow
alright
but
even
though
flavor
is
good
the
rest
is
ordinary
imo

o
i
love
british
barleywines
im
finding
a
number
of
american
barleywines
that
i
really
dig
too
and
this
is
up
there
in
my
top
two
or
three
i
had
looked
for
this
in
bottles
for
over
a
year
and
found
it
today
had
on
tap
last
year
ill
have
to
get
more
when
im
back
at
this
store
oh
its
a
happy
day
great
barleywine
highly
recommended
overall
incredibile
very
smooth
with
layers
of
complexity
and
a
thick
but
not
heavy
body
make
this
a
brew
that
commands
your
attention
and
respect
id
love
to
see
what
more

would
do
for
this

see

really
nice
barleywine
maybe
not
quite
elite
of
the
elite
but
really
good
no
question
o
pretty
decent
sipping
beer
though
the
presence
of
the
alcohol
makes
it
a
less
than
easy
drinker
o
this
beer
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
has
a
nice
balance
between
malts
and
hops
beer
is
thin
and
harsh
very
hot
thins
out
on
the
end
and
has
a
really
dry
finish
leaves
me
wanting
a
glass
of
water
after
every
sip
i
didnt
like
and
wont
have
it
again
o
very
good
ages
like
a
champ
so
thankful
for
this
beer
this
ones
going
on
3
5
years
and
holding
up
very
well
plenty
of
hop
presence
and
minimal
oxidation
oa
nice
barleywine
but
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
hops
especially
when
it
is
listed
here
as
an
american
barleywine
22
ounce
bottle
into
snifter
2011
bottle
so
it
is
probably
about
a
year
old
now

hazy
reddish

color
with
a
nice
1

with

this
is
most
certainly
a
sipper
and
i
would
expect
it
to
be
good
balance
of
flavors
and
bitterness
with
a
nice
malt
forward
profile
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
with
only
a

present
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
and
well
balanced
barelywine
nice
flavor
profile
and
very
enjoyable
stuff
dhonestly
the
alcohol
on
this
one
is
way
too
noticeable
and
detracts
form
the
beer
even
after
6
months
of
aging
not
my
cup
of
tea
at
all
every
sunday
they
have
a
special
beer
on
in
their
down
stairs
lounge
from
burton
baton
and
paolo
santo
to
vintage
smuttynose
beers
check
em
out
a
nice
barleywine
next
bottle
i
get
i
think
ill
age
it
though
very
dark
right
off
the
bat
this
deeply
red
ale
sucks
in
ambient
light
like
a
black
hole
a
strong
taste
on
the
first
couple
sips
mellows
out
into
a
very
chocolaty
taste
that
makes
you
want
to
keep
drinking
pretty
standard
barley
wine
that
is
good
for
an
occasion
large
enough
to
share
so
invite
the
friends
to
try
some
strong
so
drink
it
early
on
very
good
worth
getting
cheers
drinkability
and
overall
impression
a
nicely
sippable
and
drinkable
barleywine
and
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
good
workmanlike
barleywine
that
is
worth
sampling
at
least
once
however
that
said
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
while
i
certainly
would
not
recommend
avoiding
this
beer
there
are
other
american
style
barleywines
that
come
in
12
oz
bottles
that
ill
choose
in
preference
mouthfeel
is
thick
its
a
good
beer
but
its
missing
some
complexity
i
think
some
time
will
turn
this
into
something
special
overall
this
comes
off
to
me
as
a
miss
the
maltiness
is
really
lacking
and
the
taste
ends
up
being
more
like
a
middle
of
the
road
double
ipa
instead
of
a
barley
wine
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
real
good
one
either
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thinner
side
of
medium
a
little
more
attenuated
and
less
sticky
then
most
barleywines
around
o
an
interesting
barleywine
good
pairing
with
a
cheese
plate
and
toasted
pumpkin
seeds
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
light
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
random
small
spots
and
streaks
of
lace
dot
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
lots
of
sediments
floating
around
in
this
one
smell
is
of
biscuitlike
malt
and
some
citrus
zest
kind
of
a
weak
smell
overall
on
this
one
taste
is
better
with
some
malt
brown
sugar
and
citrus
zest
hops
on
the
finish
mild
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
somewhat
thick
and
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
barleywine
but
nothing
too
amazing
going
on
poured
into
13oz
tulip
bottle
around
8
months
old
pours
a
nice
orange
red
lovely
sticky
white
head
around
a
a
inch
half
lacing
hangs
the
whole
beer
smell
is
hard
candy
citrus
hops
and
bready
malt
taste
all
those
things
stronger
with
grassy
flavor
some
booze
mouthfeel
is
on
the
big
side
but
not
over
the
top
i
love
this
beer
right
now
this
is
the
best
it
has
tasted
to
me
ever
great
value
also
very
delicious
beer
perfect
as
an
after
dinner
drink
olove
this
beer
great
stuff
from
smuttynose
complex
and
pretty
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
love
this
ale
and
my
only
regret
is
that
i
didnt
try
it
sooner
o
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
needs
some
time
i
feel
like
this
one
could
age
very
well
as
my
only
real
complaint
was
the
heat
and
alcohol
in
the
taste
would
like
to
get
a
bottle
and
sit
on
it
for
a
year
or
two
and
see
what
happens
i
preferred
the
wheatwine
though
to
be
fair
it
had
an
extra
year
of
aging
on
it
deep
amber
orange
pour
with
a
thin
line
of
foam
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
caramely
with
an
intense
fruity
character
as
well
there
is
a
bit
of
cherry
and
sweet
citrusy
hops
with
the
malts
alcohol
warming
seems
to
intensify
the
fruit
and
sweetness
the
flavor
is
nice
but
not
as
well
balanced
as
the
aroma
might
suggest
a
little
thin
for
a
barleywine
but
it
tastes
good
i
wonder
what
a
little
age
would
do
for
this
one
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
bit
too
sweet
and
lacked
the
complexity
to
be
in
the
upper
tier
of
barleywines
but
its
another
solid
beer
from
the
big
beer
series
worth
a
shot
o
a
summer
treat
indeed
this
strong
american
barleywine
was
great
on
its
own
and
would
pair
nicely
with
a
variety
of
nutty
and
funky
cheeses
im
sure
a
raspberry
or
chocolate
dessert
might
pair
well
also
and
take
some
of
the
edge
out
of
that
10
abv
with
some
natural
sweetness
exceptional
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
well
worth
trying
and
good
o
smuttynose
could
get
away
with
labeling
this
overlyhopped
barleywine
a
double
ipa
and
no
one
would
be
the
wise
i
like
it
but
its
definitely
a
little
hoppier
than
i
like
my
barleywines
more
malt
isnt
necessary
though
it
just
needs
to
be
cut
back
on
hops
itll
take
a
while
to
drink
this
one
thankfully
it
should
remain
ok
as
it
warms
up
a
cloudy
redorange
color
with
only
a
small
amount
of
head
that
leaves
quickly
big
lightly
roasted
malty
nose
with
a
tropical
citrus
aroma
the
alcohol
content
is
present
but
balanced
with
the
large
malt
and
hop
character
the
taste
is
a
big
spice
bread
malt
with
a
huge
hop
flavor
a
spicy
mild
citrus
and
orange
finish
the
finish
is
bitter
but
smoothed
out
by
a
bite
of
alcohol
at
5
99
a
bottle
this
stuff
is
excellent
value
this
is
how
i
like
a
barleywine
decent
balance
with
only
a
moderate
hoppy
bitterness
to
the
finish
it
allows
both
the
malt
and
hops
have
their
time
to
shine
ill
be
buying
this
again
im
sure
overall
i
dont
care
for
this
beer
fresh
but
7yrs
in
the
cellar
have
made
this
a
totally
different
beer
overall
solid
example
of
the
style
and
easier
to
drink
than
i
expected
overall
this
at
4
years
old
is
a
very
pleasant
easy
drinking
barleywine
this
sits
in
the
range
of
very
good
but
not
great
bws
though
i
personally
prefer
a
bw
with
some
residual
hop
profile
d
this
had
a
very
nice
bright
scent
and
taste
similar
to
old
ruffian
body
was
a
bit
weak
and
alcohol
was
definitely
noticeable
so
it
needed
to
be
sipped
some
age
would
really
help
mellow
and
improve
this
as
long
as
it
doesnt
thin
too
much
more
in
the
cellar
very
nice
drink
o
in
terms
of
drinkability
this
beer
ranks
high
overall
it
is
equally
impressive
worth
seeking
out
or
trading
for
i
need
to
cellar
some
of
this
to
see
how
it
ages
this
is
a
another
smutty
triumph
d
fairly
drinkable
it
is
a
big
beer
and
it
shows
with
a
lot
of
strong
flavor
good
thing
is
this
flavor
is
well
balanced
and
really
solid
the
booze
shows
through
a
bit
but
not
in
a
bad
way
at
all
overall
i
like
this
one
more
of
an
english
than
americanstyle
but
perhaps
thats
just
because
more
and
more
americanstyle
barleywines
are
cranking
up
the
hop
presence
this
one
is
nicely
balanced
and
would
only
benefit
from
more
time
in
the
cellar
perhaps
another
year
pretty
standard
barleywine
decent
enough
but
the
sweetness
is
really
tough
to
get
past
i
think
its
damaged
the
roof
of
my
mouth
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
fine
smuttynose
brews
ive
had
in
the
past
but
decent
enough
notes
nice
barleywine
reminds
me
of
the
common
ground
it
shares
with
their
wheatwine
and
while
different
brews
it
makes
me
long
for
that
one
the
wheatwine
was
also
rather
assertive
but
the
sweeter
edge
of
the
wheat
made
it
more
drinkable
upfront
and
im
missing
that
a
bit
here
oone
of
the
better
barleywines
i
have
tried
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
pours
a
hazy
reddish
orange
with
half
inch
of
cream
colored
head
settles
to
a
thin
ring
couple
blobs
of
lace
left
behind
smell
a
big
hit
of
apple
skin
and
caramel
citrus
peel
really
fruity
though
nothing
particularly
pops
out
a
little
cherryesque
among
others
taste
dark
brown
sugar
sugary
dates
lemon
peel
notes
of
cherry
and
red
apple
theres
a
sugared
fruit
sweetness
balancing
bitterness
and
a
major
hit
of
booze
this
is
pretty
nice
but
a
bomber
is
asking
a
bit
much
given
the
upfront
alcohol
this
one
benefits
from
the
new
rating
system
as
overall
its
quite
good
but
the
drinkability
takes
a
nosedive
about
halfway
through
the
bomber
jan
2011
bottling
definitely
worth
cellaring
o
this
beer
really
is
different
for
the
style
i
expected
this
malty
beast
and
it
didnt
happen
citrus
overtones
and
a
nice
underlying
malt
presence
made
this
a
very
enjoyable
beer
the
abv
was
not
present
at
all
for
most
of
the
beer
this
beer
is
fantastic
fresh
which
i
dont
say
for
many
barleywines
d
while
the
flavor
and
texture
are
quite
nice
the
heat
in
this
is
just
too
strong
for
just
10
i
normally
have
no
trouble
getting
through
a
high
gravity
bomber
but
completely
sober
im
having
a
lot
of
trouble
getting
just
half
way
through
this
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
average
carbonation
decent
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
moderate
for
the
style
drinkability
was
pretty
good
it
was
a
nice
barleywine
to
sip
on
this
evening
it
had
some
big
flavors
but
managed
to
integrate
them
together
pretty
well
a
very
nice
beer
overall
at
10
abv
it
is
almost
as
drinkable
as
can
be
and
is
some
serious
motivation
for
me
to
find
a
job
so
i
can
age
some
of
these
at
this
early
stage
it
pairs
exceptionally
well
with
a
very
strong
well
aged
cheddar
i
had
it
with
a
2
year
old
vermont
grafton
cheddar
which
brought
out
both
depth
in
the
malt
as
well
as
some
of
the
sharper
bitterness
still
a
bit
young
and
i
think
once
the
awkward
hop
presence
fades
it
might
come
into
its
own
as
it
is
now
though
its
a
very
interesting
barleywine
picked
up
at
berts
in
hooksett
nh
grabbed
a
few
bottles
so
some
can
be
aged
as
well
poured
a
very
light
redorange
hue
head
formed
nicely
and
stuck
around
for
the
party
the
aroma
was
a
very
light
citrus
smell
the
taste
was
a
interesting
as
i
felt
it
was
nicely
balanced
for
a
young
barleywine
sweet
citrus
and
malt
molded
together
to
form
a
nice
crisp
flavor
it
was
a
very
inviting
brew
and
i
was
happy
to
to
finish
the
bottle
the
carbonation
was
of
medium
along
with
the
body
the
brew
was
nice
to
sip
on
but
was
a
bit
to
fresh
for
me
to
grab
another
i
am
excited
to
see
how
this
beer
turns
out
in
two
years
d
this
is
a
hell
of
a
chore
to
drink
it
has
a
great
ripe
and
sweet
dark
fruit
taste
but
the
thickness
and
alcohol
make
this
difficult
to
finish
mouthfeel
is
hearty
and
a
bit
warming
for
this
nice
winter
evening
overall
smuttynose
has
another
quality
product
with
this
barleywine
while
its
not
as
hoppy
as
some
american
barleywines
bigfoot
its
well
balanced
character
make
it
quite
enjoyable
smuttynose
barleywine
style
ale
has
a
lovely
orange
colour
and
an
excellent
1
cm
head
that
fades
to
1
mm
of
lacing
the
smell
is
of
hops
and
citrus
with
some
breadiness
very
nice
spells
like
a
double
ipa
the
taste
is
initially
like
hops
and
citruss
which
then
moves
to
bitterness
and
breadiness
the
aftertaste
is
still
citrussy
but
the
alcohol
becomes
slightly
noticeable
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
but
it
tastes
like
a
double
ipa
and
not
like
a
barleywine
did
they
mislabel
the
bottle
i
like
double
ipas
so
im
not
complaining
sweeter
than
i
would
have
thought
but
overall
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
a
beautiful
deviation
from
a
classic
barleywine
poured
a
burnt
orange
in
color
with
pale
brown
highlights
that
had
a
thin
head
and
left
a
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
was
pretty
hoppy
alongside
citrus
caramel
brown
sugar
and
sweetness
im
assuming
are
from
the
malts
the
taste
was
dominated
by
the
caramel
brown
sugar
sweetness
but
did
have
a
good
hoppy
bitter
punch
and
had
citrusy
accents
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
citrusy
sweet
hoppy
sugary
bitter
finish
it
drank
decent
but
was
a
bit
too
hoppy
and
bitter
for
the
type
of
barleywines
i
like
d
sort
of
middle
of
the
road
for
a
barleywine
not
really
bitter
not
really
sweet
and
what
is
there
is
not
really
anything
that
great
or
interesting
im
a
big
fan
surprised
to
find
a
bottle
still
on
the
shelf
after
a
year
but
this
was
a
great
find
i
have
heard
this
is
very
hoppy
when
fresh
but
i
liked
the
heavy
malt
tones
when
aged
this
was
a
decent
barleywine
the
flavor
was
good
and
strong
but
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
lighter
than
most
other
barleywine
22oz
bomber
pours
a
really
hazy
light
brown
color
with
a
thin
head
moderate
amount
of
lacing
aromas
of
some
fruits
a
surprising
amount
of
hops
and
a
kind
of
sweet
boozey
smell
taste
has
a
good
amount
of
hop
flavor
to
it
slightly
bready
with
a
nice
mix
of
alcoholic
sweetness
some
malt
flavor
but
picking
up
on
more
hops
than
malt
this
is
a
really
nice
barleywine
good
kick
of
hops
to
it
as
well
as
the
usual
barleywine
characteristics
the
boozey
taste
is
nicely
balanced
and
not
an
overload
i
will
be
looking
for
this
one
again
mediumbodied
and
rather
resinous
on
the
palate
definitely
americanstyle
this
one
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
for
the
style
a
solid
barleywine
overall
not
a
standout
but
on
the
higher
end
for
the
style
overall
i
am
really
enjoying
this
barleywine
consuming
after
i
laid
it
down
for
several
months
wonder
how
it
would
taste
after
a
year
or
so
only
one
way
to
find
out
either
way
it
drinks
much
lighter
than
the
abv
and
is
probably
delicious
fresh
or
aged
speaking
of
which
a
strong
bitter
taste
finishes
the
tasting
experience
the
beer
is
full
sticky
and
thick
with
some
notable
alcohol
lingering
upon
swallowing
the
carbonation
is
a
touch
heavy
but
overall
this
beer
is
above
average
in
drinkability
this
isnt
my
favorite
american
barleywine
and
lacks
the
hop
flavor
unique
maltiness
and
masked
alcohol
of
the
best
of
the
style
like
gratitude
and
unfortunately
i
dont
think
it
has
enough
character
to
be
anyone
elses
favorite
but
for
a
readily
available
and
somewhat
affordable
american
barleywine
this
is
certainly
a
beer
to
try
if
you
like
your
beers
big
and
strong
d
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
delicious
if
you
like
your
beer
to
taste
like
banana
or
lemon
bread
d
the
sharp
alcohol
presence
takes
the
drinkability
considerably
down
i
like
how
balanced
this
beer
is
but
the
alcohol
is
a
little
to
dominating
i
would
love
to
taste
this
beer
with
the
alcohol
masked
better
or
just
reduced
future
outlook
really
excellent
repeat
business
eminent
and
i
want
to
snag
one
of
these
to
send
off
to
the
cellar
d
very
little
sign
of
the
abv
in
this
brew
i
really
dig
the
overall
fruit
character
from
the
combination
for
malts
and
hops
picked
this
up
on
a
recent
trip
to
wiscoland
very
tasty
barleywine
nice
balance
between
caramel
and
the
citrus
it
was
a
big
beer
but
easy
to
drink
maybe
i
should
mix
in
a
few
more
barleywines
over
the
summer
since
this
one
really
hit
the
spot
larry
the
character
once
said
that
he
didnt
have
to
dress
well
because
he
was
married
you
cant
dress
up
a
big
thick
beer
in
a
nice
bottle
and
call
it
a
barleywine
fortunately
smuttynose
has
crafted
a
nice
hop
monster
with
a
lot
of
depth
suitable
for
a
nice
dinner
with
cheryl
and
the
greenes
d
if
you
like
really
hoppy
bwines
this
is
for
you
i
prefer
mine
a
little
less
carbonated
and
with
a
bigger
malt
presence
still
a
good
offering
from
smuttynose

upfront
along
with
plum
and
fig
some
caramel
and
brown
sugar
and
a
healthy
dose
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
a
tad
syrupy
and
drinkability
was
pretty
good
despite
the
abv
overall
a
pretty
solid
barleywine
a
tad
hoppy
to
drink
much
of
but
still
a
tasty
experience
overall
this
drinks
more
like
a
dipa
at
the
moment
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
of
course
this
is
a
very
drinkable
highly
complex
barleywine
and
im
spoiled
to
be
able
to
pick
this
up
at
the
store
whenever
i
want
excellent
barleywine
d
a
nice
barleywine
the
malt
complexities
mellows
after
a
few
swigs
only
critique
the
label
the
old
time
peasant
farmer
is
a
little
creepy
a
really
nice
barleywine
very
well
structured
love
it
now
would
probably
love
it
with
age
overall
a
solid
example
of
the
barleywine
somewhat
of
a
split
of
the
american
and
english
styles
would
be
interesting
to
see
if
a
few
years
age
would
take
some
of
the
heat
of
this
d
one
of
the
most
dynamic
and
drinkable
american
barleywines
youre

d
overall
i
am
really
enjoying
this
barleywine
this
is
a
fresh
bottle
and
it
is
already
drinking
nicely
i
would
imagine
that
age
would
just
enhance
the
flavors
and
cut
down
on
some
of
the
warmth
from
the
alcohol
a
bit
definitely
worth
a
try
recommended
d
this
was
a
little
on
the
young
and
hot
side
it
has
potential
to
get
better
so
i
might
buy
one
to
age
im
just
not
a
fan
of
big
beers
in
big
bottles
so
im
not
sure
i
will
seemingly
a
bit
more
like
a
english
style
barleywine
then
the
american
style
its
a
fairly
solid
and
most
definately
warmalcohol
laced
orangified
treat
to
take
in
would
like
more
caramel
thickness
balanced
in
along
with
a
deeper
body
and
complexity
not
bad
you
can
drink
it
fresh
and
aging
it
might
only
expose
more
of
the
mellow
flavors
underneath

solid

of
the

representation
of

just
like
the
rest
of
the

series
that
ive
had
but
american

fans
should
consider
this
one

sure

its

the
taste
has
an
omnipresent
hoppiness
to
it
from
the
get
go
a
gripping
bitterness
is
present
and
it
lingers
on
through
to
the
finish
sweet
caramel
with
a
floral
i
had
5
great
cases
of
this
last
year
especially
on
the
aftertaste
a
bit
of
age
would
probably
be
best
on
this
one
to
mellow
it
all
out

though
a
bit
syrupy
very
dry
in

drinkability
is
good
this
is
an
old
school
barley
wine
in
the
nose
meaning
mainly
big
malt
sweet
cherry
and
brown
sugar
dominate
i
even
picked
a
touch
of

in
there
nice

went
down
quite
easy
pears
candied
strong
citrusy
flavors
which
leads
into
a

a

a
nice

even
a

with

in

taste
remained
a

a
very
smooth
but
that
doesnt
make
it
bad
by
any
means
and
its
definitely
a
good
local
offering
to
me
in
ma
id
like
to
see
what
some
time
would
do
with
this
i
think
some

it
was
the

on

that
night

being

it
poured
to

an

the
head
didnt
stay
around
or
she
poured
very
carefully
i
turned
around
while
she
poured
it
so
i
could
have
missed
something
the
smell
was
really
unique
peaches
and
apricots
i
swear
there
was
a
peach
in
there
the
flavor
was
big
and
strong
with
malt
sweetness
a
very
nice
aroma
but
a
bit
more
controlled
with
the
alcohol
as
it
warms
more
and
more
flavor
nuances
come
out
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
nice
for
the
style
an
enjoyable
barleywine
and
the

it
seems
as
though
the
formula
for
this
years
smutty
barley
is
in
no
way
related
to
those
from
years
past
ive
had
a
few
bottles
from
2003
and
almost
no
carbonation
the
aroma
is
nice
some
sweeter

there

it
is

high

things
went
smoothly
from
there
tasting
notes
indicate
that
any
bitterness
in
the
hops
was
more
than
smoothed
away
the
rich
malt
was
also
enticing
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
beer
was
immensely
drinkable
after
a
few
moments
it
faded
to
a
foamy
cap
and
then
to
a
collar
subsequent
lacing
was
minimal
the
maltiness
is
big
and
chewy

there
are
bushels
of

with

heavy

and
just
right
carbonic
tang
to

body
is
good
but
the
heavy
bitter
yields
some
coarseness
ditto
for
the
finish
with
some
off
flavors
though
overall
id
definitely
have
just
not
right
away
id
be
especially
curious
to
try
it
with
some
aging
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
barley
wine
randomly
came
across
a
4pack
of
this
and
didnt
have
very
high
expectations
but
i
really
like
this
one
may
even
be
one
of
my
favorite
nonba
barleywines
that
ive
tried
to
date
its
a
bit
nuttier
than
i
expected
but
it
works
well
and
is
balanced
by
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
and
some
heat
on
the
backend
even
so
the
alcohol
is
pretty
wellmasked
and
so
it
isnt
too
boozy
at
all
overall
a
real
solid
barleywine
for
a
reasonable
price
not
what
i
expected
but
a
good
ale
overall
wonderful
balance
of
flavors
being
quite
young
the
hops
are
very
forward
and
present
in
the
beer
beautiful
hop
character
though
strikes
a
harmony
with
the
toasted
sweet
malts
and
sticky
dark
fruits
lying
underneath
nice
enjoyable
sipper
alcohol
quite
noticeable
overall
pretty
good
barley
wine
a
little
bitter
from
the
roasted
barley
but
good
big
and
heavy
overall
a
nice
barleywine

this
is
a
very
nice
beer
ill
probably
be
looking
out
for
this
one
again
overall
its
a
good
effort
for
the
style
if
a
smokey
and
bitter
barleywine
sounds
nice
try
this
out
huh
for
all
the
guff
and
mockery
that
ive
heard
about
utah
brewing
in
general
at
home
and
abroad
this
offering
really
sloughs
off
all
that
inanity
big
and
brash
hoppy
and
malty
in
layers
that
i
cant
possibly
appreciate
from
this
single
instance
in
time
worth
trying
if
only
to
see
how
its
doing
and
right
now
for
me
its
doing
just
fine
o
intense
amount
of
hops
barley
malt
and
alcohol
but
rounded
off
nicely
with
strong
fruits
a
fantastic
offering
pours
out
a
slightly
murky

a
thin

of
caramel
dried
fruit

piloncillo
and
pnw
hops

lots
of
caramelized
malts
very
toasty
more
so
than
i
would
have
imagined

the

aftertaste
has
some
roasty
coffee
notes
hops
are
prominent
and
resinousgrassy
mouthfeel

with
some
tingly
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
solid
barleywine
but
nothing
to
go
crazy
about
oaverage
barleywine
alcohol
a
little
too
forward
my
bottle
was
picked
up
from
a
bottle
shop
the
date
of
the
bottled
on
is

i
bought
it

overall
appears
a
deep
murky
mahogany
brown
hue
big
tan
head
forming
thick
with
fine
speckled
lacing
smells
like
an
aged
barleywine
what
does
that
mean
the
hops
have
tamed
the
malts
are
full
of
over
ripened
fruit
and
big
alcohol
notes
the
smell
is
of
spicy
plum
and
raisin
notes
that
i
cant
quit
sniffing
on
dark
fruit
brown
sugar
malt
layers
in
the
flavor
nothing
like
an
aged
bigfoot
a
hint
of
diacetyl
or
wet
cardboard
in
the
malt
character
just
from
oxidation
plum
and
dark

im
intrigued
to
see
what
this
beer
tastes
like
fresh
with
2
years
of
age
its
fantastic
o
i
had
this
last
summer
and
loved
it
but
somehow
missed
writing
a
review
this
second
single
bottle
confirms
my
recollection
of
it
as
a
superior
barleywine
cheers
o
recommended
for
fans
of
americanstyle
barley
wines
not
excellent
but
its
pretty
good
o
time
does
this
beer
a
favor
wasnt
an
amazing
beer
but
was
pretty
solid
if
i
see
this
beer
at
a
good
price
ill
totally
grab
a
few
and
throw
them
in
the
cellar
cheers
overall
a
solid
barley
wine
nothing
spectacular
but
worth
the
try
i
threw
two
in
the
cellar
to
see
if
it
really
falls
of
after
a
few
months
will
update
a
big
abrasive
barelywine
not
bad
just
to
much
for
me
everything
is
pretty
overwhelming
here
worth
a
try
but
not
something
i
am
dying
to
come
back
to
maybe
i
should
hold
on
to
the
rest
of
the
4
pack
for
a
while
and
see
where
this
goes
overall
a
malty
and
perfumey
lemonpine
american
barleywine
thats
enjoyable
to
the
end
worth
a
try
for
you
abw
fans
its
probably
one
of
the
more
easy
drinking
barley
wines
and
its
good
o
a
good
ale
less
a
traditional
barley
wine
than
just
a
good
ale
overall
a
fine
beer
in
this
style
probably
a
one
or
two
beer
night
due
to
the
high
abv
enjoy
overall
it
drinks
easy
for
a
big
beer
nice
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
think
this
just
ever
so
slightly
kicks
old
guardians
and
bigfoots
butt
i
found
this
to
be
less
hop
forward
than
the
aforementioned
try
this
if
you
get
the
chance
its
well
worth
the
3

12oz
price
poured

a

hangs

in
the
tongue
body
is
fairly
large
nice
carbonation
a
touch
dry
and
easy
drinking
for
its
heft
very
nice
o
this
is
an
excellent
beer
quite
a
bit
hoppier
than
i
was
expecting
but
it
balanced
nicely
this
is
a
big
beer
at
10

but
drinks
quite
a
bit
lighter
if
i
had
bought
the
4
pack
i
could
see
these
being
dangerous
possibly
my
favorite
new
barley

suberb

warms
down
the
throat
all
the
way
to
the
belly
thick
and
viscous
in
the
mouth
with
a
mild
carbonic
bite
truly
outstanding
and
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
o
so
nice
to
pick
a
winner
with
limited
dollars
a
vote
of
confidence
for
exploring
the
rest
of
the
uinta
menu
good
job
brewers
o
hop
bitterness
is
littered
throughout
this
barleywine
even
though
the
malts
keep
right
up
with
the
hops
the
bitterness
winds
out
in
the
end
so
if
you
enjoy
a
hopforward
american
barleywine
this
one
could
definitely
fit
the
bill
overall
above
average
to
almost
good
a
boring
barleywine
but
still
pretty
tasty
worth
a
try
you
might
find
you
like
this
lowkey
high
alcohol
offering
o
overall
this
is
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
in
addition
the
price
is
right
it
seems
to
be
readily
available
at
the
moment
as
well
i
would
like
to
lay
down
a
few
four
packs
of
this
and
see
how
it
matures
since
there
is
some
bitterness
and
a
lot
of
complexity
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
candidate
for
a
couple
years
of
aging
cheers
o
another
fine
offering
from
uinta
this
beer
isnt
too
complex
or
wild
but
very
enjoyable
this
is
my
first
barley
wine
so
i
do
not
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
but
as
an
introduction
to
the
style
i
like
it
a
lot
although
i
like
uinta
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
barleywine
i
held
on
to
it
for
a
few
months
probably
should
have
been
more
but
i
expected
to
like
it
more
than
i
did
it
seemed
to
be
lacking
in
most
areasa
bit
thin
average
taste
not
as
much
complexity
as
id
hoped
even
the
alcohol
didnt
seem
to
be
too
present
it
seemed
to
be
lacking
something
and
thats
sad
ill
revisit
this
some
day
but
it
wont
be
on
my
regular
rotation
of

of

and
will
bring
a

lovers
on
the
milder
side
but
still
a
tasty
barleywine
worth
a
try
o
a
quality
beer
ive
had
many
a
barley
wine
some
better
than
this
but
not
many
overall
it
has
everything
i
look
for
in
a
good
barley
wine
with
a
few
little
surprises
nutty
hints
in
the
smell
and
a
very
crisp
finish

some
will

i

the
fact
its

not
sure
how
much
id
like
this
fresh
this
seems
like
its
at
the
perfect
age
overall
maybe
i
should
have
aged
this
for
a
bit
the
taste
is
fairly
complex
but
the
saltiness
is
very
offputting
probably
wouldnt
revisit
this
o
it
is
a
weird
barleywine
it
is
heavily
hopped
and
tastes
like
a
weird
ipa
but
the
barleywine
comes
through
a
little
bit
and
kind
of
ruins
it
the
malty
sweetness
backbone
tastes
really
odd
and
kind
of
ruins
it
i
would
say
it
tastes
like
a
bad
bigfoot
the
aftertaste
is
no
good
overall
i
celebrate
the
anniversary
of
uinta
by
letting
them
know
this
was
a
spot
on
brew
im
not
even
finished
with
it
and
i
feel
a
bit
toasty
after
trying
this
and
stones
barley
wine
brew
i
have
discovered
that
im
fond
of
this
style
complexly
flavored
and
unique
cheers
flavor
has
more
caramel
with
some
more
burnt
caramelized
notes
a
touch
of
molasses
plus
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
mix
together
the
finish
is
a
tad
dry
and
the
floral
hop
aspect
is
more
noticeable
at
this
juncture
reminds
me
of
a
solid
english
style
bw
perhaps
like
victory
old
ho
prosit
1568
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
am
not
a
big
hop
fan
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
hoppy
barley
wines
i
have
had
bigfoot
is
almost
too
aggressive
nogne
100
is
is
hopped
to
the
point
it
doesnt
even
seem
like
a
barley
wine
anymore
but
this
grapples
it
in
and
fits
the
american
bill
on
the
style
overall
i
like
this
beer
the
rich
malt
and
toasty
aroma
is
my
favorite
aspect
its
pretty
well
balanced
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
this
is
my
first
beer
from
uinta
and
im
not
disappointed
good
bitter
brew
here
but
much
of
the
complexity
im
sure
that
went
into
this
ends
up
hidden
behind
a
massive
bitter
wall
of
hops
i
wanted
rich
complexity
and
i
got
an
overdone
overhopped
beer
i
appreciate
the
effort
but
i
wont
be
having
this
again

offering
this
was
a
very
well
done
barley
wine
the
complexity
level
was
slightly
higher
than
a

probably
because
the

seemed
dialed
down

american

alcohol
is
really
quite

it
might
be
worth
putting
a
couple
of
these
in
the
cellar
to
see
what
happens
as
the
hops
character
dissipates
over
time
a
nice
little
barleywine
maybe
its
lacking
defining
character
but
it
tastes
carefully
crafted
wouldnt
choose
it
above
others
that
are
easilyattainable
but
i
woudnt
knock
it
either
big
thanks
to
illudium
for
the
sample
this
is
a
great
barleywine
absolutely
delicious
one
of
the
best
ive
had
an
unbelievable
malthop
balance
and
so
much
to
appreciate
d
nice
hoppy
barleywine
great
overall
balance
and
smoothness
o
this
beer
is
very
dry
for
the
style
but
quite
nice
its
over
3
years
old
but
i
get
very
little
oxidation
flavor
i
enjoyed
this
o
i
tend
to
prefer
english
style
barleywines
that
dont
have
as
strong
of
hop
character
but
especially
for
the
price
this
one
is
definitely
worth
it
has
all
that
nice
barleywine
malt
character
with
a
hop
quality
that
balances
everything
out
nicely
drinks
very
smoothe
and
easy
o
a
potent
brew
for
malt
lovers
with
a
great
hop
kick
not
very
complex
but
that
could
come
with
age
this
is
a
bitter
beer
but
not
puckering
or
super
dry
its
welcomed
since
the
sweetness
could
get
out
of
hand
quickly
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
which
isnt
shy
o
a
very
solid
sipper
take
your
time
and
enjoy
with
some
gouda
cheese
o
very
good
and
on
point
you
get
enough
of
the
barleywine
aspect
of
the
beer
and
some
hops
as
well
nicely
done
this
used
to
be
about
the
only
barley
wine
sold
in
utah
im
glad
to
see
it
elevated
from
occasional
to
yearround
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
the
utah
liquor
store
in
sugar
house
not
a
complex
barleywine
but
well
balanced
and
decently
crafted
o
this
is
a
very
hoppy
and
bitter
barleywinesomething
that
hopheads
could
enjoy
especially
if
they
drink
it
cold
if
you
are
looking
for
something
with
more
complexity
you
need
to
let
this
one
fully
warm
up
to
let
the
malty
flavors
develop
a
little
more
the
alcohol
isnt
that
noticeable
in
the
taste
i
drank
one
of
these
about
8
months
post
bottling
and
reviewed
this
one
at
about
18
months
post
bottling
it
is
for
sure
better
now
than
fresher
the
time
really
did
help
this
one
along
as
far
as
calming
down
the
booziness
and
helping
the
alcohol
and
hops
to
meld
into
the
caramel
and
toffee
solid
barleywine
for
sure
glad
i
have
2
more
12oz
to
sit
on
for
a
while
longer
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
barleywine
i
wish
i
had
some
bottles
in
my
basement
aging
for
the
next
ten
to
fifteen
years
o
good
and
flavorful
sometimes
a
barley
wine
can
go
heavy
on
the
alcohol
and
feel
almost
like
vodka
was
added
but
this
is
tamed
but
still
has
an
intriguing
taste
o
better
than
i
remember
it
i
remember
liking
it
but
this
is
a
great
american
barleywine
im
a
big
fan
of
what
uinta
does
underwhelmed
will
revisit
after
one
sits
for
about
34
months
kind
of
expected
a
bit
more
overall
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
an
american
bw
and
a
good
candidate
for
aging
glad
that
i
have
several
more
bottles
in
my
cellar
overall
looking
like
4s
across
the
board
here
and
that
feels
about
right
for
this
one
an
above
average
enjoyable
barleywine
that
just
doesnt
quite
do
enough
for
me
to
get
into
that
upper
tier
that
said
definitely
worth
a
try
o
sort
of
a
boring
barleywine
not
bad
but
not
a
standout
overall
a
very
nice
american
barleywine
and
from
utah
go
figure
very
good
barleywine
great
mix
of
flavors
that
hides
the
alcohol
nicely
overall
not
bad
but
not
my
idea
of
a
successful
american
barleywine
of
note
mf
is
a
bit
watery
certainly
not
what
i
would
expect
in
a
barley
wine
definitely
liked
last
years
version
better
but
looking
forward
to
doing
a
vertical
when
i
get
4
years
worth
of
course
that
was
because
of
how
strong
the
alcoholic
content
of
this
was
this
faintly
reminded
me
of
a
belgian
dubbel
or
tripel
and
fans
of
those
styles
as
well
as
barleywines
will
not
be
disappointed
here
the
body
is
certainly
here
and
even
though
this
didnt
go
down
quickly
theres
enough
flavor
and
carbonation
to
keep
this
from
being
too
heavy
id
love
to
buy
a
few
more
and
see
how
it
ages
overall
this
is
quite
good
and
i
have
found
myself
pleasantly
surprised
with
uinta
in
general
buy
this
beer
or
steal
me
some
overall
strong
example
of
the
style
but
it
probably
could
use
a
little
more
malty
sweetness
to
provide
a
touch
greater
balance
this
has
to
be
one
of
utahs
finest
beers
cheers
o
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
american
barleywine
style
at
4
months
old
it
is
well
balanced
and
drinking
perfectly
to
my
taste
this
is
definitely
a
good
relatively
cheap
option
from
an
up
and
coming
brewery
that
has
impressed
me
of
late
overall
solid
barleywine
will
hold
on
to
more
of
these
in
the
future
for
aging
very
well
balanced
and
the
tropical
flavors
stand
out
the
most
happy
to
have
opened
it
but
sad
i
could
have
held
on
to
it
for
longer
not
disappointed
one
bit
right
now
overall
i
would
like
to
have
a
few
bottles
of
this
with
some
age
on
them
to
see
how
it
mellows
in
the
bitterness
category
id
also
like
a
touch
more
sweetness
to
make
this
a
true
sipper
taste
wise
still
a
very
good
beer
even
when
fresh
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
memorable
o
super
impressed
had
strong
grain
and
wood
character
i
liked
that
it
avoided
the
sweetness
i
find
in
a
lot
of
other
barleywines
it
helped
set
this
beer
apart
it
had
a
barrelaged
ipaishness
to
it
bet
this
beer
would
go
great
with
a
cigar
o
a
pretty
malt
heavy
barelywine
i
understand
that
much
of
the
aroma
and
some
of
the
flavor
hops
have
faded
by
now
but
still
should
have
more
hop
presence
not
a
bad
drink
perhaps
i
just
tried
it
while
it
was
beginning
its
transition
to
a
elegant
aged
barelywine
of
sorts
suggest
waiting
a
few
more
months
if
you
still
have
this
brew
o
a
solid
barleywine
all
around
nice
nose
and
strong
flavor
needs
a
little
aging
to
smooth
it
out
though
o
i
generally
enjoy
barleywines
and
this
one
was
ok
but
there
was
just
something
lingering
in
the
taste
that
was
off
putting
and
stood
out
a
bit
too
much
to
me
it
wasnt
the
alcohol
so
im
really
just
not
sure
what
it
was
liked
this
beer
not
great
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
o
good
barley
wine
better
than
what
i
remember
but
the
last
one
was
fresher
so
maybe
it
gets
better
with
age
i
get
this
sense
this
needs
some
age
to
let
some
sweetness
roll
forward
and
killsubdue
the
hop
presence
i
would
hope
that
with
more
time
some
more
classic
flavors
would
come
out
fruit
caramel
etc
otherwise
i
think
this
could
get
better
and
this
isnt
at
prime
my
2
cents
o
one
of
fav
barleywines
always
what
i
expect
it
to
be
and
well
priced
which
makes
it
tough
to
beat
o
a
great
barleywine
nice
and
hoppy
everything
balances
well
to
hide
the
alcohol
level
and
makes
it
a
nice
and
easy
drinking
brew
ps
i
love
this
brewery
though
they
are
all
about
the
wind
power
unique
styles
and
cool
label
art
work
other
than
hop
notch
and
dube
it
seems
like
most
of
their
12oz
bottles
are
subpar
id
love
to
tackle
one
of
their
bombers
though
a
comfortable
beer
this
satisfies
without
occupying
the
spotlight
and
will
work
on
a
sunny
winter
day
the
flavor
is
maybe
a
little
plain
for
a
barleywine
but
really
no
complaints
this
is
a
great
option
for
the
price
especially
o
this
has
a
good
drinkability
it
is
a
little
bit
of
a
sipper
but
it
has
nice
flavor
and
goes
down
good
the
alcohol
content
is
present
but
hidden
pretty
well
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
i
recommend
checking
this
one
out
i
would
buy
it
again
a
good
plumy
and
bitter
barleywine
something
is
lacking
not
quite
sure
what
too
much
hops
o
this
is
stronger
and
more
flavorful
than
most
barleywines
o
an
average
barleywine
i
am
liking
a
lot
of
stuff
from
uinta
thanks
guys
for
a
great
brew
taste
is
fairly
straight
forward
with
a
very
heavy
caramel
malt
front
alcohol
is
quite
present
even
with
more
than
a
year
of
age
on
it
and
warms
the
belly
hint
of
citrus
in
the
aftertaste
which
seems
odd
but
at
least
spices
things
up
a
bit
from
the
typical
malt
coverage
soft
carbonation
gives
a
decent
creaminess
bottled
in
february
2010
dark
brown
in
color
and
murky
poured
with
a
thick
beige
foam
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
that
left
random
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
toffee
and
caramel
malt
aromas
are
prominent
the
hoppy
aromas
that
others
have
noted
have
likely
faded
with
this
being
nearly
2
years
old
there
is
a
hint
of
hop
spiciness
toward
the
end
that
accompanies
the
boozy
aroma
as
this
warms
very
smooth
feel
with
lazy
rich
carbonation
tangy
citrus
and
ripe
fruit
flavors
up
front
that
slowly
grows
thru
the
middle
the
strong
toffee
and
caramel
malt
backbone
is
difficult
to
suppress
throughout
finishes
fairly
dry
with
a
lingering
sweet
toffee
flavor
accompanied
by
a
tangy
hop
bitterness
ive
had
this
in
the
celler
for
about
about
6
months
letting
it
age
maybe
i
waited
too
long
pours
an
amber
color
nothing
special
but
now
awful
im
getting
a
citrusy
hop
smell
again
not
blowing
my
mind
damn
though
this
is
nice
and
smooth
not
harsh
at
all
but
a
solid
liquory
aftertaste
i
was
holding
this
for
the
packers
super
bowl
win
well
that
didnt
happen
so
im
not
overly
disappointed
but
not
as
good
as
i
expected
o
a
pretty
good
example
of
a
barley
wine
at
this
price
point
its
hard
to
pass
up
i
will
revisit
this
one
o
very
very
nice
barleywine
on
the
drier
and
more
bitter
end
of
the
scale
alcohol
is
a
little
noticeable
at
the
end
but
cellaring
may
smooth
this
out
a
bit
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
one
i
dont
find
it
to
be
anything
super
groundbreaking
but
i
would
definitely
go
out
and
buy
this
one
again
i
got
it
as
single
12oz
bottle
from
tru
beer
in
easthampton
ma
but
i
just
might
go
back
later
this
week
and
grab
a
sixpack
overall
its
a
nice
and
enjoyable
barley
wine
well
with
the
price
on
it
overall
mixed
the
nose
is
great
and
the
flavors
would
be
great
of
they
werent
drowned
out
by
the
crazy
bitter
astringent
hops
o
very
nice
barely
wine
let
it
sit
a
bit
longer
it
even
taste
better
great
everyday
beer
i
remember
liking
this
more
the
1st
time
i
had
it
there
is
more
bitter
hop
flavor
than
i
would
like
there
seem
to
be
some
nice
things
going
on
behind
the
burn
taste
up
front
i
just
wish
it
was
more
in
the
foreground
bottled
11232010
overall
its
not
bad
the
toastyburnt
thing
is
a
little
offputting
but
the
beer
tastes
ok
otherwise
i
probably
wont
pursue
it
again
however
o
excellent
i
will
add
this
to
my
top
10
barleywine
beers
to
get
every
year
uinta
beers
have
just
started
to
hit
the
greater
sacramento
area
and
they
are
very
good
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
more
overall
weird
smell
body
is
disjointed
and
not
much
fullness
while
not
an
inherently
bad
beer
its
somewhat
of
a
fail
as
a
barleywine
this
is
a
full
bodied
brew
leaning
towards
medium
in
the
feel
it
displays
a
light
level
of
carbonation
warming
alcohol
gets
a
bit
distracting
as
it
warns
a
light
resinous
pinelike
hop
presence
keeps
me
interested
but
overall
this
one
just
didnt
totally
come
together
for
me
t
as
a
barleywine
its
relatively
simple
in
flavor
profile
very
boozy
something
like
drinking
a
whiskey
and
beer
is
that
such
a
bad
idea
from
time
to
time
if
aged
it
would
probably
open
up
and
develop
some
complexity
in
its
fruited
profile
i
think
ill
try
it
see
you
in
a
couple
of
years
version
xvii
pours
a
hazy
brass
color
with
a
thin
white
head
into
a
wine
glass
smells
instantly
of
booze
which
isnt
surprising
given
the
abv
also
smells
of
straw
and
a
peculiar
maltiness
flavor
matches
the
nose
and
the
bright
carbonation
fizzes
the
flavors
into
a
very
unique
palate
cant
say
this
is
my
favority
barleywine
but
it
is
different
mouthfeel
was
as
heavy
as
it
gets
thick
and
weighty
even
the
carbonation
doesnt
make
it
feel
any
lighter
a
good
beer
on
a
cold
night
dr
not
very
drinkable
on
account
of
the
high
abv
but
the
abv
is
well
concealed
by
the
flavours
to
an
extent
the
mouthfeel
is
too
thick
for
it
to
be
really
drinkable
its
really
nothing
special
o
good
beer
tastes
and
smells
great
wish
i
had
let
it
age
for
longer
this
one
is
barely
over
six
months
old
o
overall
this
is
a
good
strong
barleywine
the
nose
is
really
nice
the
taste
is
just
pretty
strong
alcoholwise
i
think
if
i
had
another
bottle
of
this
id
sit
on
it
for
612
months
and
try
it
again
as
i
feel
it
could
get
even
better
would
have
it
again
overall
i
like
it
and
its
one
of
the
better
deals
out
there
not
the
best
barleywine
and
it
doesnt
do
anything
different
but
it
works
pretty
well
o
an
excellent
beer
with
flawless
balance
in
my
opinion
rich
and
full
of
flavor
yet
remarkably
drinkable
for
its
size
if
the
opportunity
presented
its
self
to
get
some
more
of
this
id
certainly
jump
on
it
obviously
this
is
worth
cellaring
that
would
cut
down
the
raw
bitterness
a
bit
which
is
just
about
the
only
unpleasant
character
here
even
still
its
an
impressive
flavoursome
and
wellintegrated
barleywine
id
love
to
try
this
vintage
again
in
a
couple
of
years
great
smooth
mouthfeel
as
she
goes
down
slight
sweetness
makes
it
not
quite
perfectly
balanced
but
the
taste
lingers
on
the
palate
with
a
nice
hop
character
sticking
around
good
brew
happy
17th
d
probably
not
as
good
as
it
was
fresh
it
just
seems
to
be
a
bit
off
oxidized
i
guess
id
love
to
try
one
of
the
newer
versions
o
its
a
must
buy
every
year
i
drink
one
and
sit
on
three
for
the
rest
of
the
year
ages
super
well
great
bwine
oup
there
with
north
coast
old
stock
as
a
high
quality
low
price
barley
wine
that
is
sure
to
improve
with
age
overall
a
good
barleywine
in
my
opinion
picked
up
a
a
4
pack
at
total
wine
in
riveredge
nj
for
7
99
and
worth
even
more
i
am
going
to
get
more
soon
no
doubt
o
this
beer
is
decent
enjoyable
nothing
special
or
worth
revisiting
but
still
tasty
well
balanced
alcohol
is
hidden
for
being
10
4
aroma
of
caramel
malt
and
some
brown
sugar
rather
lacking
in
hops
for
such
a
young
barleywine
with
some
earthychocolate
hops
coming
out
with
a
bit
of
warming
flavor
follows
suit
with
caramel
some
raisin
and
light
brown
sugar
notes
as
well
as
a
light
touch
of
roast
this
doesnt
come
across
as
overly
sweet
yet
manages
to
mask
the
alcohol
fairly
well
it
is
evident
on
the
nose
but
less
so
on
the
tongue
finish
is
fairly
full
bodied
but
rather
nondescript
in
its
delivery
overall
an
enjoyable
pour
but
a
bit
lacking
in
complexity
for
the
style
age
may
help
but
im
not
keeping
my
fingers
crossed
and
in
fact
this
beer
warms
to
offer
a
slightly
oxidized
hop
aroma
still
worth
a
visit
overall
i
was
very
impressed
i
really
liked
the
hoppy
flavor
getting
harder
and
harder
to
find
a
nice
hoppy
barleywine
cheers
a
good
barleywine
though
i
wish
the
citrus
hops
i
smelled
in
the
aroma
translated
through
to
the
flavor
overall
3
5
good
but
not
great
might
not
age
well
with
the
strong
hop
character
the
10
is
disguised
well
nice
sticky
chewy
mouthfeel
o
i
just
started
laughing
when
i
first
tasted
this
beer
not
because
it
was
bad
but
because
it
was
so
different
granted
it
was
my
first
barley
wine
but
it
was
a
sipper
for
sure
it
was
nice
i
see
myself
daring
a
buddy
to
chug
a
glass
for
10
something
that
would
be
worth
10
but
he
wouldnt
get
to
enjoy
the
beer
itself
bummer
this
suckers
a
beast
i
couldnt
and
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
two
in
one
night
would
be
death
very
different
from
others
looking
forward
to
trying
different
barley
wines
in
the
near
future
in
fact
i
think
im
going
to
pick
a
couple
next
week
when
i
get
back
in
town
quite
a
solid
barleywine
overall
overall
theres
not
much
that
i
dont
like
about
this
beer
the
taste
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
nose
but
its
still
enjoyable
as
i
mentioned
not
quite
my
favorite
barleywine
bigfoot
currently
holds
that
distinction
but
it
is
good
and
has
reminded
me
how
much
i
enjoy
sipping
on
a
nice
barleywine
over
a
lengthy
period
of
time
good
slow
sipper
probably
even
better
in
the
colder
months
cant
wait
to
have
one
of
these
once
the
weather
cools
down
again
medium
body
and
a
very
light
carbonation
nice
bronze
color
ok
aromasomewhat
of
a
malty
raisen
like
aroma
though
fairly
muted
decent
flavorquite
the
hop
bite
going
on
has
a
fairly
dominant
smokiness
that
i
simply
do
not
care
for
here
malty
backbone
good
body
for
the
style
finishes
rather
dry
in
the
end
a
notch
above
average
as
far
as
us
barleywines
go
for
me
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
ever
had
definately
in
my
top
3
barleywines
very
complex
and
powerful
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
pours
a
semiclear
dark
copperamber
color
with
a
1
inch
khaki
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
thick
foamy
rings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
carameltoffee
brown
sugar
and
citrus
zest
hops
taste
is
of
toasty
malt
caramelized
brown
sugar
and
citrus
zest
there
is
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
tongue
after
each
sip
and
a
slight
alcohol
burn
in
the
back
of
the
throat
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
creamy
and
slightly
thick
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
barleywine
with
a
big
hop
flavor
and
my
first
beer
from
uinta
overall
pretty
tasty
glad
the
alcohol
didnt
burn
the
throat
as
much
as
the
nostrils
final
thought
at
3
a
pop
and
10
abv
you
cant
even
tell
its
10
this
beer
is
for
all
lovers
of
beer
dark
reddish
brown
and
a
little
bit
murky
with
a
dense
yellowbeige
cap
decent
head
retention
with
lots
of
fine
lacing
sheets
towards
the
top
of
the
glass
and
spottier
as
the
beer
disappeared
tons
of
caramel
in
the
aroma
grainy
malty
and
sweet
mild
alcohol
with
a
hint
of
fruit
and
toffee
the
flavour
threw
me
off
initially
since
it
was
very
different
than
the
aroma
much
fruitier
up
front
sort
of
a
raisin
sweetness
throughout
but
still
with
caramel
and
toffee
bitterness
wasnt
prominent
always
present
but
nicely
balanced
alcohol
was
well
controlled
decent
texture
malty
and
full
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
some
dryness
overall
it
was
enjoyable
o
i
had
hopes
from
the
aroma
but
this
is
not
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
imo
honestly
might
dump
the
second
half
of
this
if
i
had
a
better
option
on
hand
and
the
burnt
flavors
hadnt
killed
my
tastebuds
i
do
enjoy
the
intensity
of
the
hops
here
it
would
be
a
dilemma
for
me
to
age
it
im
perfectly
content
with
drinking
it
after
the
4
months
after
the
bottling
date
o
not
a
beer
i
ever
care
to
have
again
i
didnt
like
the
taste
or
the
smell
and
its
really
hard
to
like
a
beer
if
you
dont
like
those
two
things
overall
another
very
well
done
beer
from
uinta
the
complexity
of
the
the
flavors
is
great
and
i
think
this
may
actually
rival
big
foot
in
terms
of
hoppiness
i
will
surely
be
laying
a
couple
of
these
down
to
see
how
the
flavors
progress
overall
a
fairly
intense
barleywine
the
hops
really
never
let
go
of
your
tastebuds
which
makes
it
harder
to
taste
the
sweet
malts
my
tongue
is
slightly
numb
as
i
type
this
and
thats
after
only
14
of
the
bottle
o
from
a
brewery
i
have
never
heard
of
on
a
great
night
like
this
even
after
following
up
one
of
my
new
favorite
barleywines
the
lagunitas
gnarleywine
this
really
stays
memorable
its
good
almost
great
worth
picking
up
dthis
has
a
very
interesting
balance
with
a
huge
hop
presence
in
the
nosse
and
still
a
fairly
strong
presence
in
the
taste
a
little
sugary
and
the
body
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
but
not
bad
the
perfect
ale
to
celebrate
any
occasion
which
should
i
celebrate
it
to
i
can
think
of
several
events
going
on
in
my
life
that
i
could
raise
my
glass
to
just
thought
of
it
how
about
ending
two
sentences
in
this
paragraph
with
a
preposition
do
this
big
barleywine
is
fullflavored
with
malt
and
bitterness
featured
but
it
threatens
to
fatigue
the
palate
more
than
one
would
hope
for
in
a
beer
of
the
style
acidity
distracts
getting
in
the
way
of
what
might
otherwise
be
a
pleasant
slowsipping
experience
drank
on
41709
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
brown
color
with
some
light
orange
highlights
the
head
didnt
really
stick
around
too
long
here
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
is
typical
barley
and
malt
aromas
and
possibly
some
subtle
fig
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
light
sweetness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
overall
i
wasnt
getting
too
much
from
this
that
made
it
so
special
its
a
decent
barley
wine
at
best
in
my
opinion
o
this
was
a
pretty
solid
barleywine
really
easy
to
drink
and
a
solid
flavor
profile
oh
yea
this
was
the
17th
anniversary
i
found
this
beer
to
be
solid
one
id
buy
a
few
of
but
not
go
crazy
with
an
anniversary
barleywine
that
is
available
year
round
kind
of
odd
as
is
the
fact
that
i
bought
this
almost
two
years
ago
in
utah
and
just
recently
saw
the
same
vintage
available
at
a
store
here
in
boston
anyway
from
a
12
oz
stubby
bottled
040909
72
ibus
pours
a
chillhazed
crimson
with
low
carbonation
and
topped
with
a
thin
tan
cap
that
retains
a
thin
collar
and
doesnt
manage
to
lace
the
glass
smells
richly
malty
and
caramelly
with
coffee
roast
milk
chocolate
floral
alcohol
and
very
heady
citric
oily
and
resinous
hops
still
tastes
quite
hoppy
at
two
years
old
with
the
same
hop
profile
that
gives
an
almost
harsh
bitterness
lots
of
melanoidins
and
crystal
malts
contribute
a
robust
malty
base
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
the
yeast
is
earthy
and
fruity
and
there
is
a
light
booziness
as
well
that
helps
lead
into
a
warming
bitter
finish
medium
to
full
on
the
palate
moderatelycarbonated
with
a
tonguescraping
bitterness
and
powdery
yeast
feel
not
terribly
complex
but
it
is
smooth
delicious
wellintegrated
and
it
has
aged
quite
well
so
far
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
at
five
years
old
to
see
how
its
going
overall
not
a
barley
wine
that
id
go
back
to
but
i
can
understand
how
others
might
dig
this
pretty
mild
in
terms
of
aroma
and
flavor
strength
though
it
offers
up
a
good
deal
of
complexity
in
each
arena
worth
a
try
i
suppose
o
i
had
the
xiv
a
few
years
a
go
and
i
remember
liking
it
more
than
this
vintage
but
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
forget
any
stateassociated
beerhandicap
this
is
a
rock
solid
barleywine
and
it
keeps
getting
better
with
age
pours
a
very
deep
amber
with
almost
no
head
and
minimal
lacing
carmel
chocolate
some
fresh
sweet
red
fruit
and
a
little
grassy
woody
earthiness
interesting
stuff
taste
is
initially
a
liquid
caramel
but
is
quickly
taken
over
by
a
lingering
slightly
overpowering
bitterness
the
hops
do
not
appear
to
be
well
integrated
a
decent
level
of
carbonation
gives
this
mediumbodied
ale
a
nice
bite
overall
the
aromas
were
good
but
its
hard
to
get
paste
the
subpar
flavors
im
holding
out
hope
that
this
will
mellow
out
with
some
more
time
bottled
4909
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
slightly
dirty
white
head
head
didnt
last
long
clung
reasonably
well
and
was
replenished
by
a
small
stream
of
bubbles
from
the
bottom
aroma
was
typical
barleywine
a
touch
of
evident
alcohol
with
a
fair
amount
of
grainy
sweet
too
sweet
for
me
trace
of
something
that
reminded
me
of
banana
and
cloves
taste
had
some
hops
and
also
a
tad
of
bitterness
mellowed
out
some
over
time
but
not
typical
barleywine
flavors
felt
good
in
the
mouth
coated
well
and
was
nicely
carbonated
overall
a
middle
of
the
road
barleywine
not
bad
but
nothing
outstanding
overalla
very
nice
slightly
above
average
darley
wine
with
a
balanced
tone
and
a
very
unreadable
abv
does
not
taste
hot
or
even
imply
the
10
4
that
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
think
i
paid
10
for
the
four
pack
so
for
a
barleywine
of
this
quality
also
a
great
value
gonna
lay
two
of
them
down
for
a
while
overall
pretty
good
very
drinkable
alcohol
is
not
even
noticeable
just
wish
for
a
bit
more
complexity
in
the
flavor
and
wish
i
was
sipping
it
by
a
fireplace
on
a
cold
night
but
a
warm
spring
night
in
central
cali
will
do
notes
the
main
range
is
there
and
if
this
is
actually
a
year
old
since
bottling
already
maybe
a
couple
of
years
in
the
cellar
with
soothe
things
out
and
the
initial
sense
is
that
it
might
be
quite
something
else
after
that

o
this
isnt
even
a
month
old
super
super
young
it
needs
time
to
coalesce
buy
now
drink
later
o
decent
stuff
but
i
wouldnt
dedicate
an
anniversary
to
it
drink
i
cant
wait
to
crack
my
cockeyed
cooper
now
that
i
have
had
this
brew
i
read
the
ba
mag
article
about
uinta
and
wanted
to
try
there
beers
great
brews
will
return
to
this
one
will
be
reviewing
again
after
i
age
the
other
bottle
for
longer
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
silky
smooth
with
a
medium
body
and
a
medium
alcohol
and
caramel
feel
very
high
drinkability
considering
the
strength
and
style
this
is
a
one
and
done
per
night
yet
still
a
very
good
and
very
tasty
beer
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
barley
wine
this
one
is
always
an
excellent
choice
i
just
got
a
4
pack
of
this
guy
what
a
steal
im
putting
two
of
these
back
and
probably
getting
more
to
put
back
for
a
while
its
a
well
balanced
beer
the
sugars
are
dead
on
the
additional
flavors
are
a
bit
of
a
miss
its
nothing
too
strong
im
hoping
age
might
help
this
guy
out
a
bit
drinkability
was
excellent
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
barleywines
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
nothing
too
extraordinary
about
this
beer
just
a
fine
example
of
the
style
nice
and
clean
tasting
excited
to
see
what
acouple
years
of
aging
does
to
this
beer
d
for
what
this
is
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
delicious
barley
winenice
work
uinta
alcohol
is
wellmasked
and
the
feel
isnt
overly
heavy
but
the
relative
sweetness
and
aggressively
bitter
finish
kept
me
sippin
slowly
unsurprisingly
most
elements
of
this
beer
improved
as
it
warmed
up
a
bit
this
beer
is
a
rubybrown
color
very
clear
with
a
small
tan
head
the
smell
is
classic
eastern
barleywine
lots
of
malt
it
smells
like
a
maltextract
infused
brew
lots
of
boozy
alcohol
and
grain
scents
its
got
a
lot
of
melanoidenhanced
scents
the
taste
is
similar
with
loads
of
sweet
malt
alcohol
warming
is
notable
but
it
isnt
overbearing
full
body
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
for
an
american
barleywine
it
checks
all
the
boxes
it
should
it
delivers
a
heavy
hand
of
sweet
malt
but
is
balanced
by
resin
hops
the
interplay
provides
complexity
and
depth
that
being
said
i
do
like
it
for
a
beer
to
have
here
and
there
drinkability
is
very
good
for
this
strong
a
beer
d
a
very
pleasant
surprise
this
is
an
underrated
sipper
that
deserves
more
attention
d
complex
nose
and
taste
abv
is
a
bit
daunting
i
like
this
but
in
a
dirty
way
if
that
makes
any
sense
its
reminding
me
of
the
love
i
had
for
cheap
booze
when
i
was
underage
naughty
but
tasty
drinkability
im
surprised
what
a
great
barleywine
this
is
i
sort
of
got
it
at
an
inbetween
time
in
its
life
at
9
months
old
id
love
to
try
a
really
fresh
one
and
one
with
a
year
or
two
on
it
pretty
good
value
too
drinkability
fairly
drinkable
for
a
barley
wine
the
abv
is
tolerable
for
good
sitting
complex
taste
but
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
still
not
a
bad
brew
when
i
saw
the
label
i
was
stunned
to
see
a
beer
from
the
land
of
mormon
with
a
10
4
abv
but
here
it
is
overall
a
really
nice
barleywine
that
has
great
balance
overall
average
barlywine
somewhat
drinkable
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
smooth
with
little
carbonation
overall
i
think
the
16
months
that
this
beer
has
been
sitting
in
the
bottle
has
only
helped
it
out
a
nice
wellrounded
flavor
profile
without
the
alcohol
being
to
hot
d
excellent
the
alcohol
is
wellmasked
this
beer
is
best
enjoyed
slowly
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
for
a
highalcohol
high
flavor
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
a
dark
brown
nearly
opaque
with
a
lightly
tan
head
smells
slightly
smoky
with
a
malty
nose
and
some
faint
citrus
smell
taste
is
malty
caramel
with
some
coffee
flavor
feel
is
full
and
smooth
with
a
brief
crispness
towards
the
end
overall
a
very
enjoyable
barleywine
and
one
i
will
look
for
at
the
store
next
time
i
think
this
is
an
english
barleywine
instead
of
an
american
the
malt
aggressiveness
fits
the
version
from
across
the
atlantic
d
alcohol
has
completely
gone
into
hiding
none
on
the
nose
and
none
on
the
palate
the
beer
is
quite
sugary
so
it
lends
itself
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
drinking
very
well
with
age
could
only
imagine
how
bitter
it
would
be
fresh
damn
this
beer
is
bitter
lovely
but
bitter
hopheads
should
rally
to
this
beer
cellaring
should
not
even
be
a
factor
here
as
it
is
so
delicious
in
its
fresh
form
love
the
hops
now
overall
an
excellent
us
barleywine
it
could
maybe
do
with
a
few
months
aging
but
its
certainly
recommended
d
one
is
all
i
want
would
not
get
this
one
again
this
is
not
to
hot
a
very
nice
beer
and
one
i
would
like
to
put
an
additional
few
years
on
this
is
the
xvi
obtained
in
an
ogden
state
store
while
visiting
here
in
august
its
a
very
pretty
beer
deep
amber
covered
with
a
thick
head
the
smell
is
wonderful
rich
and
malty
with
some
caramel
notes
there
are
slight
hints
of
sweetness
that
may
overwhelm
the
first
taste
is
excellent
well
balanced
and
not
too
heavy
the
conditioning
is
very
good
just
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
lingering
finish
no
cloying
flavors
at
all
this
seems
more
drinakable
than
most
barleywines
but
idve
liked
a
better
balanced
finish
drinkability
smooth
beer
this
is
close
to
on
par
with
a
1
year
bigfoot
nice
beer
drinkability
is
fairly
good
the
style
isnt
exactly
known
for
massive
drinkability
but
the
mouthfeel
as
well
as
the
raw
brashness
of
the
hops
limit
the
drinkability
a
bit
doesnt
approach
the
best
of
the
style
the
beer
is
a
sipper
with
some
heat
coming
through
on
the
finish
the
body
thinness
helps
with
the
drinkability
but
i
think
this
beer
could
age
nicely
and
would
be
a
malt
lovers
dream
in
2
years
complex
and
balanced
im
curious
to
try
newer
and
older
versions
of
this
bad
boy
my
first
bottle
three
days
ago
seemed
okay
second
bottle
yesterday
impressed
a
bit
more
todays
tasting
showed
me

of
a

notes
ffo
of
big
american
imperial
barleywine
ales
i
e
stonge
old
guardian
etc
or
american
old
stock
ales
like
it
a
lot
fairly
affordable
but
not
my
absolute
favorite
the
year
has
probably
done
it
a
lot
of
good
is
my
guess
having
never
had
it
fresh
though
a
real
pleaser
especially
for
a
slc
local
aroma
is
nice
but
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
intense
flavor
is
a
bit
stronger
but
not
anything
overly
special
it
is
a
solid
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
not
necessarily
anything
id
track
down
again
d
not
that
drinkabe
which
is
normal
for
a
barleywine
i
guess
thicker
than
a
typical
barleywine
its
also
more
chocolatey
which
makes
it
a
bit
more
filling
pretty
great
offering
overall
im
not
sure
about
this
beer
it
tastes
very
strange
to
me
very
strong
malty
aroma
is
a
bit
overpowering
flavor
is
strong
and
syrupy
it
was
good
to
try
because
ive
always
heard
about
this
brewery
but
in
general
this
is
not
my
favorite
beer
dark
red
in
color
light
carbonation
strong
flavor
and
aroma
good
for
a
try
but
i
wont
get
it
agin
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
color
almost
black
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
cappuccino
colored
foam
aromas
of
dried
apricots
raisins
tobacco
and
leather
on
the
palate
the
hops
really
kick
in
bringing
some
good
citrus
to
balance
out
the
caramel
malt
a
very
good
beer
even
better
considering
its
less
than
84
pack
d
couldnt
have
many
of
them
but
considering
the
style
its
about
what
it
should
be
d
a
sipper
for
sure
not
the
easiest
to
drink
multiples
of
but
i
do
enjoy
trying
new
beers
copper
colored
ale
with
a
slight
cream
colored
foamy
head
and
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
syrupy
aroma
with
some
sugar
cane
whiffs
and
bourbon
the
taste
is
very
hoppy
with
the
bourbon
coming
through
on
the
swallow
and
a
slight
burn
on
the
way
down
no
sweetness
at
all
on
this
i
was
waiting
for
a
sweetness
kick
but
it
never
came
slight
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
at
10
6
this
went
down
very
smoothly
i
had
no
idea
who
this
brewery
was
before
i
tried
this
at
a
bw
festival
but
after
trying
i
am
a
big
fan
great
stuff
bottled
8292008
consumed
during
the
2008
holidays
that
december
and
my
review
was
mislocated
until
just
now
d
hmm
i
find
a
lot
of
ironies
in
this
beer
while
doing
the
review
from
a
pure
technical
standpoint
i
find
this
to
not
stand
up
particularly
well
to
the
finest
examples
of
the
style
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
very
enjoyable
i
think
it
is
its
ease
of
drinking
that
makes
the
difference
the
richness
and
total
sipper
qualities
of
the
best
barleywines
are
so
far
from
this
they
dont
even
seem
to
be
the
same
style
this
is
quite
an
easy
drinker
due
to
its
excellent
balance
in
short
i
think
i
like
this
beer
much
more
than
the
review
might
indicate
drinkability
soso
at
best
there
are
better
american
versions
on
the
market
all
in
all
this
was
a
decent
brew
this
would
definitely
fall
on
the
american
side
of
barleywines
good
to
try
if
you
like
american
bwines
otherwise
if
youre
not
a
hop
guy
then
dont
bother
with
this
one
overall
an
outstanding
representation
of
the
style
not
too
rich
and
an
enjoyment
to
drink
great
mouthfeel
its
enjoyable
not
uber
bitter
maintains
perfect
balance
throughout
great
price
for
this
beer
and
very
drinkable
especially
for
the
style
and
abv
impression
my
first
uinta
brew
and
if
this
is
their
modus
operandi
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
the
taste
was
much
more
mellow
then
my
nose
lead
me
to
assume
there
is
a
cocoa
malt
sweetness
upfront
with
roasted
malt
and
a
kind
of
pretzel
like
bready
quality
a
very
noticable
piney
hops
presence
shows
up
toward
the
finish
and
remains
the
alcohol
is
definitely
there
trademark
of
the
style
but
it
is
surprizing
subtle
overall
a
delicious
well
balanced
barley
wine
the
mouthfeel
is
where
this
beer
shines
above
all
of
its
other
aspects
wonderfully
thick
and
coats
the
mouth
with
oils
like
a
dipa
but
it
is
a
little
undercarbonated
the
drinkability
is
on
par
with
the
flavor
served
in
a
8oz
glass
clear
deep
auburn
colored
beer
aroma
nice
bit
a
touch
soapy
lots
of
rum
and
raisin
and
etoh
sweet
caramel
in
smell
sweet
boozy
beer
dark
fruits
dates
burnt
sugars
etoh
warm
all
way
through
carbonation
minimal
medium
body
rum
lingers
in
finish
and
aftertaste
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
that
clings
tightly
to
my
snifter
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
and
pine
but
combined
with
the
big
alcohol
esters
registers
a
bit
chemical
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
pinesol
cleaning
solution
the
taste
is
balanced
but
not
in
a
smooth
way
the
caramel
and
roasted
notes
do
not
mesh
well
with
the
citrus
hop
flavors
and
the
alcohol
presence
is
a
bit
sharp
overall
while
i
like
their
idea
of
a
big
west
coast
barley
wine
this
one
came
off
a
bit
chaotic
i
would
definitely
recommend
sitting
on
this
one
for
atleast
a
year
dfor
a
10
abv
brew
the
alcohol
is
very
well
concealed
rather
sharp
and
biting
certainly
hop
forward
a
very
tasty
brew
that
is
without
question
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
from
utah
and
i
have
been
there
12oz
dark
brown
bottle
i
assume
that
its
because
this
brewery
is
located
in
utah
that
ive
never
heard
of
it
i
live
in
new
england
this
beer
definitely
makes
me
want
to
sample
their
other
offerings
because
its
very
adventurous
for
its
style
d
high
drinkability
despite
having
a
fair
amount
of
alcohol
pours
dark
amber
with
offwhite
head
that
retains
reasonably
well
to
a
thin
laced
rimjob
nose
is
fresh
with
some
pine
and
brown
sugary
baked
goods
palate
has
the
same
elements
with
piney
hops
caramel
brown
sugar
sweetness
and
a
little
alcohol
warmth
on
the
finish
more
easy
drinking
than
many
barleywines
ill
have
to
get
this
one
on
draft
when
im
in
utah
next
time
drinkability
a
very
complex
beer
that
id
love
to
try
again
seek
it
out
if
you
can
drinkability
my
first
barleywine
and
overall
this
is
a
good
one
is
a
sipper
for
sure
but
is
very
enjoyable
pours
a
deep
dark
red
with
a
thinnish
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
cap
smell
is
initially
hops
with
some
citrus
wafting
its
way
into
my
nose
the
hops
fade
quickly
to
reveal
more
layers
of
malt
brown
sugar
prunes
and
dried
cherries
and
a
bit
of
caramel
theres
a
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
but
its
quite
restrained
the
taste
is
caramel
and
burnt
sugars
a
little
pine
and
some
alcohol
there
is
more
alcohol
in
the
taste
than
the
aroma
led
me
to
believe
long
lingering
hop
bitterness
and
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
mix
of
syrupy
water
body
is
a
bit
thinner
than
i
would
have
liked
carbonation
is
low
decent
barleywine
might
be
better
with
a
bit
of
age
to
tone
the
alcohol
down
a
bit
d
this
stage
in
its
life
its
too
hot
and
overly
bitter
this
one
will
only
improve
with
time
i
am
sure
of
it
poured
dark
amberred
with
a
thin
white
head
into
a
4oz
sampling
glass
the
smell
yielded
maltiness
raisin
pineapple
and
a
searing
sweetness
the
taste
also
was
very
syrupy
sweet
with
an
alcohol
burn
evident
in
the
finish
and
i
couldnt
help
but
wonder
how
more
aging
would
help
smooth
out
the
harshness
of
this
beer
maybe
ill
try
reviewing
again
in
a
few
years
if
i
can
get
my
hands
on
some
more
of
this
vintage
the
mouthfeel
while
syrupy
at
times
was
nicely
thick
for
a
barleywine
drinkability
again
i
think
that
this
beer
would
benefit
from
more
aging
glad
my
computer
battery
died
midreview
last
time
around
here
is
the
condensed
version
pours
a
very
dark
crimson
brown
with
a
one

a
snifter

creamy

behind
the
retains
decently
and
dies
down
to
a
ring
around
the
side
with
clouds
atop
the
beer
smells
initially
like
a
double
ipa
hop
bomb
but
soon
becomes
a
nice
mix
of
malts
hops
and
alcohol
tastes
of
malts
piney
hops
a
bit
of
alcohol
dark
fruits
and
nutty
flavors
the
balance
is
mostly
good
but
seems
to
go
towards
malts
and
then
back
to
huge
hops
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
creaminess
to
it
the
carbonation
is
a
tiny
bit
too
much
here
for
the
flavors
and
style
the
warming
is
really
not
overwhelming
at
all
and
adds
a
nice
feel
a
huge
bittersweet
flavor
is
left
on
the
tongue
for
a
long
time
after
drinking
this
one
drinkability
is
good
the
taste
is
good
the
price
is
decent
the
alcohol
and
hops
seem
to
take
over
this
one
as
time
goes
on
as
i
long
for
the
balance
the
beer
had
midway
through
drinking
it
this
is
one
of
the
better
barley
wines
i
have
had
but
i
still
need
to
explore
this
style
a
lot
lot
more
not
quite
firm
but
creamy
enough
mouthfeel
a
little
hot
in
the
finish
but
im
impressed
overall
by
the
masking
job
and
the
brew
in
general
solid
effort
comments
i
tried
this
on
draught
at
the
acbf
in
june
and
although
the
samples
were
small
i
had
a
bunch
of
them
because
i
liked
them
so
much
the
hityouoverthehead
alcohol
finish
was
to
my
memory
not
evident
at
that
time
i
was
excited
to
find
this
in
bottles
recently
but
what
a
letdown
d
a
well
crafted
barley
not
too
over
the
top
and
not
too
blah
slow
sipper
but
id
pour
another
d
definitely
a
good
candidate
for
the
cellar
at
this
young
age
if
feels
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
i
feel
letting
it
mature
for
awhile
would
bring
out
its
full
potential
a
solid
pickup
overall
d
nice
full
barleywine
flavor
but
just
a
little
boozy
this
will
probably
do
quite
well
with
some
age
overall
i
have
to
say
that
i
am
impressed
very
easy
drinking
regardless
of
the
high
abv
plenty
of
nice
fruit
flavors
along
with
a
decent
kick
from
the
hops
my
sinuses
are
tingling
and
my
stomach
is
warm
a
great
barley
wine
from
utah
aroma
is
strong
and
rather
fruity
with
a
firm
alcohol
ting
the
sort
i
expect
from
a
barleywine
it
pours
a
translucent
dark
mahogany
almost
a
cola
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
if
none
too
persistent
pale
creamtan
head
flavor
is
more
hoppy
than
malty
almost
like
an
ipa
with
a
fairly
strong
and
ragged
alcohol
bite
texture
is
rough
and
rowdy
and
tingles
all
the
way
down
wowee
my
first
barleywine
quite
an
experience
pours
an
amber
color
with
virtually
no
head
what
little
there
is
quickly
fades
to
the
thinnest
of
crowns
smell
is
quite
strong
kind
of
fruity
and
spicy
theres
literally
a
feel
of
stinging
on
the
nostrils
taste
is
similar
fruity
taste
with
something
else
nuts
figs
raisins
maltiness
at
first
taste
but
definite
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
alcohol
is
very
noticeable
warming
sensation
after
sipping
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonated
not
very
drinkable
but
i
believe
thats
to
be
expected
of
this
style
definitely
made
for
sipping
overall
i
thought
the
nose
and
flavors
were
cleaner
while
the
beer
was
on
the
colder
side
which
in
my
experience
is
a
rarity
for
a
big
barleywine
i
say
try
it
while
its
cold
50
deg
f
but
even
if
its
warmer
its
worth
a
shot
the
drink
is
silkysmooth
and
fullish
in
body
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
cut
the
sweet
stickiness
nearperfectly
a
definite
sipper
id
like
to
see
with
a
little
age
on
it
im
not
a
big
fan
of
barleywine
but
this
was
a
good
one

good
beer
much
the

as
my

some

richard
a
pleasure
as
always
md
this

is
even
more
outstanding
than

tasted
two
days
ago
thanks
to
its
more
balanced

a

and
equally
beautiful

well
as
a

seriously
i
still
cant
feel
the
impact
of
alc
even
way
past
the
last
drop
granted
this
delicious
barley
wine
is
pronounced
on
hops
as
the
term
american
barley
wine
should
guarantee
but
an
overall
supreme
balance
is
the
key
to
keep
me
in
awe
if
i
see
this
ale
a
different
vintage
of
course
again
at
the
bsf
bar
this
year
ill
try
to
secure
2
bottles
thanks
to
wasatch
for
spreading
the
love
with
this
exceptional
brew
pours
dark
brown
with
cherry
red
hues
which
make
for
spaces
which
are
barely
penetrable
by
the
light
a
slight
dark
tan
head
fades
fairly
quickly
into
a
good
thick
stripe
all
along
the
top
of
the
brew
a
big
sweet
aroma
initially
rises
to
the
nose
and
i
like
it
a
lot
following
that
are
some
sour
dark
fruits
grain
black
licorice
and
some
sweet
yeast
the
taste
involves
a
big
hop
bitterness
with
sweet
and
sour
cherries
and
a
good
sweet
breadiness
mixed
in
between
it
all
now
this
is
what
im
talkin
about
a
thin
layer
of
chocolate
is
also
discernible
a
slightly
piercing
but
very
welcome
alcohol
heat
exists
but
thats
to
be
expected
as
this
is
a
big
one
body
is
medium
to
heavy
a
little
creamy
up
front
and
a
little
dry
going
down
beers
like
this
are
just
one
of
the
reasons
trading
is
so
worth
the
effort
and
expense
drinkability
a
wondrous
beer
sipping
on
this
through
the
evening
as
i
read
a
good
book
reminds
me
of
what
i
like
so
much
about
quality
beer
a
superb
beer
that
is
worth
seeking
out
a
complete
surprise
when
compared
to
the
other
uinta
offerings
d
very
drinkable
for
a
10
barleywine
but
its
a
sipper
for
sure
i
enjoyed
what
this
had
to
offer
and
would
purchase
again
thinking
about
aging
one
or
two
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
rich
astringent
and
a
subtle
creaminess
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
full
and
the
finish
is
medium
this
is
a
very
nice
rich
well
made
barleywine
i
would
like
to
have
seen
more
strenght
in
this
barleywine
would
have
put
it
through
the
roof
i
have
enjoyed
it
very
much
careful
with
this
one
as
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
slowly
becoming
more
obvious
as
the
beer
warms
complex
with
good
flavors
and
not
too
overpowering
recommended
d
a
tasty
barleywine
for
sure
glad
i
grabbed
this
one
of
the
few
styles
i
like
to
cellar
i
would
have
let
it
age
but
i
couldnt
hold
out
6
months
the
bottle
on
22009
is
surprising
since
it
has
so
much
hop
flavor
and
is
very
fresh
and
vibrant
the
american
style
is
right
on
but
my
notes
indicate
9
8
instead
of
the
10
4
listed
here
this
ranks
up
with
some
of
the
best
west
coast
barleywines
this
is
a
barleywine
in
the
body
of
a
quenching
ipa
it
is
one
beer
that
id
love
to
have
a
running
vertical
of
stashed
away
in
the
cellar
who
would
of
thought
you
could
go
to
utah
for
one
of
americas
most
enjoyable
barleywines
in
recent
years
palates
have
become
more
difficult
more
demanding
and
uinta
deserves
full
credit
for
continuously
keeping
up
with
the
challenge
over
the
last
15
now
years
j
drinkability
this
one
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
have
had
way
more
complex
in
the
style
it
struck
me
as
a
bit
on
the
hoppy
side
i
think
one
is
enough
for
me
this
poured
a
clear
dark
mahogany
with
some
tan
head
it
smelled
like
copper
hops
and
caramel
malt
with
some
light
orange
and
honey
and
biscuit
it
tasted
like
bold
copper
hops
with
some
roasted
barley
malt
and
a
bit
of
sweet
caramel
and
alcohol
it
was
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
metallic
aftertaste
overall
this
was
good
but
not
outstanding
reminding
me
somewhat
of
a
fresh
bigfoot
it
smelled
better
than
it
tasted
and
the
flavor
could
have
been
a
bit
cleaner
too
but
other
than
that
it
had
great
body
and
was
easy
to
drink
hiding
the
alcohol
pretty
well
perhaps
some
age
would
help
sweeten
the
flavor
to
match
the
scent
which
would
make
this
a
solid
barleywine

as
this
warmed
it
was
a
pleasant
suprise

really
improved

was
not

factor
d
have
started
to
pick
up
on
the
alcohol
about
mid
glass
however
its
more
in
the
chest
than
hot
in
the
mouth
its
the
only
beer
from
this
brewery
i
can
get
my
hands
on
and
i
am
not
complaining
d
while
this
reminds
me
a
bit
of
troegs
flying
mouflan
especially
the
hop
profile
it
is
a
bit
heavyhanded
with
the
alcohol
content
you
can
definitely
detect

in
this

still
it
is
a
quite
tasty
and
drinkable
barleywine

a
very
drinkable

if
you
like
american
barleywine
style
this
compares
favorably
with
the
best
examples
of
the
style
via

hops
bready

sweet
unfermented

and
a
good

gotta
try
it
atleast
once
hoppy
balance
makes
this
beer
very
sessionable
for
an
american
barleywine
definitely
worth
a
shot
overall
good
brew
damn
tasty
barleywine
great
balance
but
still
heavy
on
the
hops
the
alcohol
is
warming
but
not
overbearing
lucky
to
try
such
a
fresh
example
ive
never
had
bigfoot
but
if
its
this
hoppy
im
gonna
be
in
trouble
this
brew
pours
a
beautiful
deep
red
with
no
head
a
sweet
smell
emanates
of
chicory
and
raisins
and
the
taste
matches
with
a
dry
hoppy
flavor
that
coats
the
mouth
and
lingers
the
hoppiness
and
heat
of
the
alcohol
takes
over
the
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
boldness
nice
for
savoring
but
it
doesnt
have
the
advantage
of
other
barleywines
in
having
different
tones
and
flavors
open
up
as
the
brew
adjusts
to
room
temperature
thus
you
get
a
straightforward
brew
instead
of
one
that
changes
d
i
have
to
give
this
beer
the
highest
rating
for
its
drinkability
the
brewers
at
uinta
have
really
made
an
excellent
american
barleywine
without
going
over
the
top
in
either
the
hops
or
malt
categories
in
the
right
situation
like
when
you
are
trying
to
stay
warm
in
your
underheated
apartment
or
trying
to
relax
while
listening
to
some
great
music
this
beer
is
just
the
right
sipper

that

pretty
smooth

beer
i
have
had
from

it
sure
is
a
good
one

worth
it

like
to
drink
again
recommended
good
american
barleywine
here
with
some
nice
robust
character
and
extremely
good
drinkibility
a

warm
up
on
a

february
evening
i
dug
it
d
a
good
sipping
beer
goes
down
easily
d
a
boringly
good
barleywine
it
really
does
not
have
anything
that
stands
out
to
make
it
remarkable
that
being
said
it
is
easy
drinking
for
the
style
and
abv
glad
i
got
to
try
a
big
beer
made
in
utah
decent
and
servicable
barleywine
which
was
enjoyable
to
drink
but
in
the
end
it
doesnt
quite
stack
up
against
the
best
in
the
style

picks
up
the
fruits

sweet
syrup
of
the
nose
with
the
bite
of
the
alcohol
as
the
beer
warms
finish
is
warming
and
a

not
a
bad
beer
overall
overall
while
i
have
certainly
had
better
i
have
certainly
had
worse
as
well
i
would
have
no
problem
at
all
with
putting
a
couple
bottles
down
in
the
cellar
and
at
2
bucks
a
bottle
not
bad
at
all
drinkability
something
was
just
a
little
lacking
with
this
one
maybe
the
hop
schedule
maybe
the
malt
bill
im
not
sure
it
was
just
a
little
weak
in
all
departments
i
suppose
its
still
a
solid
beer
though
just
not
all
that
it
could
probably
be
pours
clear
deep
amber
with
thin
dark
tan
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
sticky
crystal
malts
mixed
with
citrus
and
pine
hops
and
not
much
else
the
taste
starts
pine
hop
bitterness
that
becomes
piney
dark
fruitiness
from
dates
raisins
and
prunes
and
even
some
more
fruitiness
with
cherry
notes
nice
tasting
american
style
barleywine
it
seems
to
have
a
smooth
balance
between
dark
fruitiness
and
pine
hops
with
a
background
of
mild
malt
sweetness
i
have
had
this
beer
cellared
for
over
4
years
now
and
decided
that
new
years
eve
20082009
would
be
just
as
good
of
time
as
any
i
picked
this
up
in
park
city
over
labor
day
in
2004
this
poured
a
very
deep
burnished
ruby
color
with
1
finger
head
that
turned
to
a
whispy
film
the
aroma
on
this
is
quite
complex
and
deep
on
this
wellaged
barleywine
massive
toffee
and
butterscotch
notes
mesh
with
a
dose
of
spices
and
grassy
floral
hops
a
slight
trace
of
diacytel
is
found
but
with
a
twistoff
bottle
it
is
to
be
expected
after
this
long
the
deep
aromas
are
almost
portlike
in
nature
the
taste
is
fully
layered
with
huge
maltiness
and
subdued
hop
bitterness
the
body
is
full
yet
thinned
by
the
carbonation
the
balance
has
definitely
improved
since
i
first
sampled
this
in
04
but
still
seems
as
though
it
would
cellar
well
for
many
more
years
i
was
glad
to
bring
this
out
on
such
an
occasion
but
sad
to
see
gone
a
lot
has
happened
in
the
times
since
i
first
purchased
this
in
a
basement
alley
liquor
store
in
park
city
have
a
safe
and
happy
new
year
ahead

a

also
this
barley
wine
really
retained
a
strong
spicy

profile
even
after
nearly
a

of
age
on
it
im
glad
i
let
it
age
and
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
a

more
of
these
for

d
nice

overall
per
style
big
and
worthy
of
an
special

labeling
a
nice
warm
slow
sipper
that
progressively
gets
better
as
you
go
along
worthy
of
a
recommend
and
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
despite
its
high
abv
nature
d
being
extremely
malty
and
extremely
hoppy
it
is
as
expected
not
a

d
this
is

its

my
bottle
states
that
this
is
10
4
id
have
guessed
somewhere
in
the
8
range
based
on
taste
and
feel
despite
the
lighter
feel
this
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
and
as
the
carbonation
dropped
the
last
few
sips
were
a
challenge
d
i
doubt
ill
be
able
to
finish
this

that
coming

finishing
up

bitterness
nice
this
would
be
spectacular
with
about
24

on
it
to
age
the
hops
away
and
let
the
sweet
toasted

profiles
shine
through
a

more
mouthfeel
of
course
is
a
bit
heavy
at
10
abv
but
right
about
where
it
needs
to
be
honestly
a
decent
barleywine
that
would
age
exceptionally
well
imo
heavier
medium
body
with
very
little
carbonation
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
in
that
respect
the
higher
abv
limits
the
ability
to
sit
and
enjoy
these
all
afternoon
plus
it
isnt
quite
what
many
would
expect
when
wanting
an
american
barleywine
good
beer
but
maybe
its
in
the
wrong
category
pours
a
clear
but
very
dark
brown
that
lets
quite
a
bit
of
a
ruby
hue
show
airy
alcohol
nose
with
faint
malts
flavor
delivers
a
slight
touch
of
alcohol
on
a
slight
fruity
malty
base
smooth
overall
but
the
alcohol
bites
a
bit
feel
is
a
bit
slick
on
liquid
and
the
carbonation
is
low
easy
to
drink
but
not
displaying
any
great
complexities
at
this
time
mouthfeel
is
a
solid
medium
body
goes
down
clean
but
still
requires
sipping

the

is

heavy

there

overall
a

enough
beer
id
grab
once
in

overall
its
a
solid
american
barleywine
but
im
just
as
happy
drinking
a

is

as
they
are

doesnt

up

still
an

im
eating
with
it
this
bottle
was
a
bit
over
two
years
old
when
i
opened
it
glad
i
waited
as
it
seems
many
people
seem
to
think
the
hops
are
overpowering
when
fresh
flavors
were
nicely
mellowed
and
quite
enjoyable
barrel
character
was
definitely
present
but
not
overpowering
havent
had
this
one
fresh
but
the
way
it
drinks
at
this
age
im
happy
with
an
old
bottle
this
is
a
decent
barleywine
but
i
was
surprised
by
the
lack
of
bourbonbarrel
in
the
nose
bourbon
flavors
were
very
subdued
as
well
boosting
the
bourbon
nose
and
taste
would
be
nice
very
heavily
hopped
as
well
almost
leans
into
the
dipa
category
bottle
lots
of
hop
in
the
aroma
and
in
the
taste
along
with
caramel
toffee
and
oak
didnt
pick
up
a
lot
of
bourbon
but
a
really
good
barleywine
to
reference
an
80s
wendys
commercial
wheres
the
bourbon
poured
into
teku
glass
a
clear
dark
mohagany
brown
with
a
12
finger
brown
head
that
dissipates
rather
slowly
leaving
nice
lace
nice
dried
stone
fruits
and
brown
sugar
in
the
nose
taste
follows
with
dried
fruit
raisins
cherry
hints
of
bourbon
and
some
alchohol
but
unfortunately
it
has
a
slightly
unpleasant
bitterness
that
is
somewhat
different
that
a
hoppy
bitterness
it
might
appeal
to
some
but
detracted
from
the
beer
for
me
mouth
is
substantial
slightly
viscous
sweet
but
not
quite
cloying
overall
a
decent
attempt
but
unfortunately
it
misses
the
mark
for
me
certainly
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
there
is
an
appealing
brashness
but
i
find
it
lacking
in
depth
and
complexity
drinks
more
like
a
hot
porter
than
a
barleywine
smell
is
great
and
then
disappointment
has
a
great
body
to
it
im
a
big
fan
of

beer

by

that
delights

ending
with

cardboard
dry
funk
not
suitable
for
a

drinkable
i
would
not
age
this
beer
any
longer
o
do
not

this
beer
until
the

drop
waaaay
off
i
could

coming

quickly
through

not

follows
with

fruitand
very
light

really
not
much
else
going
on
here
and
while
the
flavor
is
only
described
as
lemony
it
isnt
particularly
bitter
either
maybe
im
drinking
lemon
pinesol
light
to
medium
bodiedstrange
for
a
barleywine
particularly
one
aged
in
barrelswith
medium
plus
carbonation
this
was
weird
pretty
much
the
exact
opposite
of
expectations
going
in
on
a
ba
barleywine
i
cant
say
it
was
bad
just
not
right
the
body
was
about
average
for
the
style
a
little
fuller
than
bigfoot
perhaps
and
had
a
dry
finish
drinkability
was
ok
but
i
would
probably
only
have
1
at
a
sitting
overall
a
nicely
solid
brew
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
poured
from
corked
750
ml
bottle
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
a
fair
barleywine
for
those
who
like
them
on
the
bitter
end
of
the
flavor
spectrum
for
an
american
attempt
at
the
beer
this
is
quite
good
the
age
and
bourbon
probably
helped
the
flavor
of
the
beer
too
a
big
bottle
and
my
friday
after
work
is
looking
all
good
poured
into
a
snifter
there
is
a
noticeable
cork
pop
and
a
lot
more
head
than
i
expected
from
a
barley
wine
it
is
black
in
color
and
the
head
is
huge
rocky
and
light
tan
very
very
nice
looking
the
smell
is
apricots
molases
vanilla
a
slight
hoppiness
and
my
mouth
is
watering
the
taste
is
phenomenal
with
boozy
fruit
wood
vanilla
and
a
slight
banana
in
there
somewhere
it
is
dry
but
not
too
much
so
with
a
noticeable
alcohol
warmth
as
it
goes
down
the
hops
are
there
just
at
the
very
start
and
then
its
all
wood
aging
from
there
you
taste
it
you
smell
it
and
you
really
get
the
sense
that
the
aging
process
rounded
off
the
sharp
edges
on
this
really
really
spectacular
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
carbonated
and
a
tad
sticky
overall
i
think
this
is
a
fantastic
barley
wine
it
is
not
sweet
like
most
it
could
if
anything
use
a
bit
more
sweetness
and
a
bit
less
woody
dryness
but
wow
just
really
terrific
o
bourbon
character
is
unfortunately
absent
for
the
most
part
this
is
still
a
good
barleywine
but
its

bitter
hop
veers
a
tad
off
alcohol
warmth
but
still
great
sipping
beer
perfect
to
share
with
friends
who
are
of
the
same
mind
overall
really
good
but
for
me
its
strange
to
have
this
somewhat
mixed
review
the
scent
just
blew
me
away
and
raised
expectations
perhaps
unreasonably
so
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
but
found
it
oddly
disappointing
after
the
taste
didnt
match
the
scent
i
suspect
next
time
around
when
expectations
arent
quite
so
high
my
feeling
might
change
but
i
will
drink
this
again
and
recommend
it
to
those
who
enjoy
american
barleywines
this
beer
loses
credit
for
lacking
in
bourbon
barrel
characteristics
but
it
gains
that
credit
right
back
for
being
a
tasty
and
enjoyable
barleywine
i
wouldve
liked
to
pick
up
more
bourbon
characteristics
but
its
still
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
well
crafted
m
light
to
medium
body
tingly
carbonation
with
a
touch
of
heat
a
very
solid
barrel
aged
barleywine
i
am
glad
i
can
find
this
on
the
shelves
amazing
aroma
i
could
smell
this
beer
all
day
this
beer
is
almost
1
5
years
old
and
still
has
quit
a
bit
of
hop
presence
more
in
the
flavor
than
the
nose
the
alcohol
is
spicy
and
somewhat
mild
except
for
the
finish
which
is
little
harsh
glad
i
set
on
this
for
awhile
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
23
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
sweet
malt
slight
roasted
malt
wood
hint
of
bourbon
hops
hint
of
cherry
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
fits
the
style
of
an
american
barleywine
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
alcohol
hops
sweet
malt
slight
roasted
malt
hint
of
wood
hint
of
bourbon
slight
chocolate
and
hint
of
cherry
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
complex
well
blended
good
appearance
good
feel
and
great
body
the
flavors
penetrate
the
back
of
my
throat
with
potent
barley
malts
vanilla
and
molasses
and
a
moderate
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
the
abv
is
not
well
masked
but
the
sweet
flavors
offset
that
o
not
my
cup
of
tea
bitterness
overrides
everything
and
for
me
made
this
unenjoyable
the
toffee
continues
to
deepen
and
so
does
the
nutty
quality
as
this
warms
for
as
high
an
abv
there
is
no
alcohol
on
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
it
translates
to
a
smooth
warmth
the
aftertaste
is
delicious
and
sweet
the
bourbon
on
the
nose
drops
off
about
mid
drink
but
it
remains
on
the
palate
and
you
are
left
with
with
a
toffee
candy
like
beer
that
is
so
easy
to
drink
you
might
forget
the
alcohol
so
be
careful
uinta
has
done
a
good
thing
with
this
beer
o
bourbon
barreled
barley
wine
must
of
missed
all
of
that
part
pretty
disappointed
super
boozy
lots
of
carmel
very
american
hoppy
not
flavorful
i
honestly
dont
think
this
beer
represents
the
words
on
the
label
well
i
did
not
like
this
i
do
not
recommend
it
save
your
money
this
has
aged
quite
gracefully
i
really
liked
that
the
bourbon
character
is
not
too
overpowering
and
really
accentuates
the
gracefully
aging
base
beer
this
beer
doesnt
quite
escape
the
bourbon
heat
in
the
finish
more
so
as
the
beer
warms
up
but
for
the
most
part
this
doesnt
detract
too
much
definitely
a
nice
beer
to
spend
an
evening
with
overall
notably
one
of
the
most
drinkable
barleywines
that
is
barrel
aged
but
being
barrel
aged
it
is
not
pronounced
on
the
barrel
aging
its
there
enough
to
notice
and
as
it
warms
you
get
some
of
the
wood
with
the
earthiness
but
personally
i
like
a
bit
more
heavy
whisky
notes
on
my
barrel
aged
beers
i
would
buy
this
again
for
a
night
with
friends
who
are
into
big
beers
but
may
not
have
delved
into
the
extravagant
this
is
a
good
step
up
but
not
a
mind
blower
i
would
drink
this
again
but
may
not
buy
it
for
personal
enjoyment
glad
i
had
the
barleywine
and
the
barrel
aged
as
well
though
a
great
adventure
overall
this
is
a
barrelaged
barleywine
done
right
poured
into
large
snifter
deep
bloodred
ruby
with
a
huge
fluffy
tan
head
even
from
a
soft
pour
that
fades
very
slowly
leaving
tons
of
lacing
smell
is
big
malt
some
bitter
hops
bourbon
and
vanilla
and
some
woody
notes
taste
is
big
malt
a
hefty
presence
of
bitter
hops
as
well
as
some
dark
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
then
it
all
smooths
out
into
bourbonvanillawoody
flavors
mouthfeel
is
huge
and
creamy
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
in
a
bad
way
overall
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
i
have
a
huge
love
for
all
barleywines
but
this
quite
didnt
do
it
for
me
factoring
in
price
you
can
save
yourself
a
few
and
grab
something
more
worthwhile
not
to
knock
it
but
there
is
more
out
there
salud
o
a
solid
beer
overall
id
like
a
bit
more
depth
and
bourbon
character
but
theres
nothing
particularly
offensive
about
it
o
hearty
not
too
sweet
complex
and
wellbalanced
hop
and
malt
mixture
much
better
than
i
expected
for
a
barleywine
this
has
not
aged
well
although
i
do
not
know
if
there
was
carbonation
to
begin
with
aged
in
a
cool
and
dark
cellar
since
receiving
it

all

very

flavors
with
a
fair
amount
of
barrel
presence
and
quite
smooth
to
sip
on
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
tried
this
fresh
and
was
just
too
hop
forward
thought
a
couple
of
years
in
the
cellar
and
it
would
come
into
its
on
shouldve
waited
another
year
overall
i
am
not
sure
how
much
a
bomber
costs
but
a
pour
on
tap
was
well
worth
it
at
this
price
one
very
unique
brew
overall
a
really
nice
example
of
a
barrel
aged
barleywine
the
hops
are
a
bit
too
much
for
my
liking
and
really
kill
a
lot
of
the
barrel
tones
at
this
age
it
is
very
nicely
balanced
however
really
easy
to
drink
pours
a
deep
tawny
brown
with
a
a
huge
tan
head
that
persists
forever
smells
of
floral
and
spicy
hops
with
a
solid
shot
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
lots
of
fruity
esters
waft
forth
as
well
as
a
touch
of
minty
menthol
and
a
faint
hint
of
bourbon
and
oak
wow
that
tastes
great
sweet
caramel
and
dark
sugars
mixed
with
a
healthy
does
of
pitted
fruits
up
front
light
bourbon
and
oak
midway
through
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
a
healthy
dose
of
hop
bitterness
and
ethanol
long
into
the
finish
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
sweet
hot
mouthfeel
and
a
light
to
moderate
level
of
carbonation
this
one
wowed
me
at
first
but
as
it
warmed
the
alcohol
heat
did
start
to
get
a
little
harsh
nice
barleywine
maybe
a
good
aging
candidate
overall
a
good
barleywine
even
though
some
carbonation
must
have
evaporated
through
the
cork
since
it
was
bottled
in
jan2011
it
most
likely
could
of
been
stored
longer
overall
so
damn
good
would
love
to
get
one
of
these
in
the
cellar
my
complaints
are
the
oilyness
and
that
the
burn
in
the
gums
is
persistent
but
otherwise
close
to
perfect
o
a
very
nice
barleywine
but
id
almost
rather
see
more
nuanced
malt
and
barrel
character
than
the
level
of
hop
acid
here
but
a
nice
late
fall
drink
on
the
coldest
night
yet
this
decadent
taste
texture
and
aroma
does
all
that
the
american
barleywine
expects
but
i
keep
looking
for
an
element
that
pushes
it
over
the
edge
a
drier
finish
a
bolder
impression
a
hoppier
start
a
sweeter
finish
something
that
pushes
me
off
the
fence
but
those
things
dont
happen
and
leaves
the
beer
in
a
wonderfully
obscure
but
regretfully
forgettable
beer
great
stuff
750
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
bottled
on
112912
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
the
aroma
is
nice
it
smells
like
caramel
dark
fruit
toffee
bourbon
and
vanilla
the
brew
tastes
like
caramel
toffee
dark
fruit
wood
bourbon
and
theres
also
some
citrusy
hops
and
a
bit
of
an
herbal
flavor
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
syrupy
and
coating
with
good
carbonation
the
bourbon
in
this
brew
is
noticeable
but
its
not
very
strong
in
either
the
aroma
or
flavor
i
do
think
that
its
still
a
good
brew
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
bourbon
kick
from
it
overall
i
liked
it
and
at
11
99
a
bottle
id
pick
it
up
again
in
the
future
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
especially
at
the
price
it
has
both
good
and
bad
qualities
2011
vintage
on
tap
at
rock
bottom
the
color
is
a
deep
amber
maple
syrup
looking
color
mostly
clear
with
a
finger
or
two
of
white
lace
that
gets
super
thin
and
dies
out
after
a
few
minutes
the
nose
is
really
bourbon
heavy
with
a
huge
grain
bill
underneath
im
not
sure
if
there
is
rye
in
this
but
it
smells
like
it
good
toasted
qualities
and
a
lot
of
booze
the
flavor
is
very
alcohol
forward
especially
when
it
warms
up
a
little
there
is
a
lot
of
sweetness
too
some
vanilla
and
some
dried
cherries
or
cranberries
or
something
providing
a
sweet
and
tart
element
majorly
full
body
this
is
a
slow
sipper
and
an
easy
beer
to
get
a
buzz
from
the
11
vintage
is
nice
and
mellow
on
the
alcohol
front
not
as
hot
but
still
just
as
strong
it
could
stand
a
tad
more
carbonation
but
being
a
few
years
old
i
cant
be
too
critical
of
that
long
boozy
sweet
finish
less
hoppy
than
some
american
barleywines
but
the
bourbon
really
shines
as
a
result
overall
an
excellent
example
of
the
barleywine
style
and
one
of
the
better
beers
coming
out
of
utah
these
days
no
complaints
overall
i
feel
that
its
current
rating
88
is
low
for
this
beer
and
i
am
certainly
going
to
buy
this
one
again
i
would
recommend
that
you
do
as
well
having
said
that
dont
expect
king
henry
or
mother
of
all
storms
but
do
expect
a
decent
english
barleywine
that
is
both
affordable
and
available
4
25
20
minutes
into
this
brew
and
the
flavors
have
mellowed
a
tad
with
the
dark
bitter
chocolate
burnt
dark
malts
and
barrel
liquor
remaining
strong
a
hearty
barley
wine
not
for
the
timid
in
denver
on
business
and
stumbled
across
barleywine
pouring
at
falling
rock
lucky
me
bartenders
attitude
reminds
me
of
no
bs
vibe
at
tornados
but
he
knew
his
sht
cockeyed
cooper
was
disappointing
in
my
opinion
a
bit
too
light
on
the
flavor
side
for
my
barleywine
tastes
on
to
round
2
overall
a
really
great
barley
wine
the
flavor
of
the
hops
are
mildly
bitter
with
pine
accent
and
mild
caramel
malt
goes
well
with
the
light
fruit
in
the
yeast
with
a
slight
brown
sugar
flavor
and
hints
of
woody
bourbon
with
a
light
tinge
of
vanilla
from
the
oak
with
mild
astringency
in
the
hops
and
light
barrel
tannin
adds
to
the
dark
dried
fruit
taste
overall
i
am
a
fan
of
the
balance
of
both
strong
and
subtle
flavors
with
light
aggressiveness
in
the
hops
adding
nicely
to
the
barrel
treatment
a
very
enjoyable
barleywine
with
inclusion
of
wood
and
bourbon
enhances
the
flavor
in
my
opinion
overall
one
thumb
up
aboveaverage
but
it
failed
to
return
my
zeal
my
zest
for
life
maybe
next
time
o
malts
really
dominate
in
this
one
with
barrel
aspects
not
very
strongnoticeable
after
having
labyrinth
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
this
one
sadly
it
did
not
live
up
to
that
one
toasted
malt
quickly
turns
to
strong
caramel
fruit
and
coconut
malt
sweetness
notes
of
oak
vanilla
and
bourbon
come
on
strong
near
the
finish
woody
herbal
bitterness
also
picks
up
near
the
end
and
lingers
long
into
the
finish
bourbonsoaked
tropical
fruits
coconut
and
caramel
also
linger
warming
but
not
overly
boozy
even
with
the
bourbonoak
presence
fullbodied
with
a
smooth
creamy
mature
feel
delicious
and
very
nicely
done
m
its
a
big
medium
bodied
beer
leading
more
of
a
ruby
brown
color
with
a
reddish
accent
there
is
a
long
lasting
head
on
top
and
some
thick
layers
of
foam
sticking
to
the
glass
going
alongs
the
lines
of
the
american
barleywine
this
one
features
notes
of
pineapple
toasted
sugar
soft
citrus
subtle
oak
and
a
full
malty
body
the
alcohol
level
at
over
11
is
hidden
with
skill
making
this
beer
a
dangerous
one
to
drink
on
its
own
better
to
do
this
one
with
a
few
good
friends
than
to
do
on
its
own
in
fact
this
was
a
fairly
hoppy
beer
they
didnt
dominate
the
taste
but
complimented
it
very
well
o
a
solid
bba
barleywine
with
huge
complexity
definitely
a
sipper
because
of
this
fact
plus
the
11
1
at
under
12
for
a
750
ml
bottle
plus
the
fact
that
this
is
yearround
this
is
one
worth
picking
up
im
sure
this
would
age
wonderfully
as
well
this
is
fantastic
it
has
complex
flavor
and
surprisingly
dangerous
drinkability
theres
great
balance
the
bourbon
is
complimentary
and
adds
complexity
this
is
all
around
solid
ill
definitely
be
having
this
again
o
ok
beer
seems
like
this
beer
is
not
ready
at
this
point
in
time
not
a
lot
of
barrel
aged
flavor
barleywine
seems
to
pack
a
bit
of
a
hop
punch
that
mixes
with
some
of
the
other
flavors
and
aromas
going
on
the
only
detractor
if
i
am
going
to
pick
one
out
is
that
it
is
a
bit
boozy
and
hot
overall
great
brew
for
a
cold
winter
night
to
sip
and
enjoy
although
i
drank
this
in
the
fall
not
a
wow
i
will
buy
it
again
type
of
brew
everything
seemed
somewhat
balanced
except
the
smell
perhaps
it
was
a
bad
batch
it
almost
ruined
the
beer
for
me
on
the
flip
side
i
do
recommend
this
brew
if
you
want
a
warm
feeling
in
your
belly
and
a
numb
brain
from
the
high
abv
i
will
buy
it
one
more
time
to
see
if
my
perception
changes
if
it
doesnt
wow
me
a
second
time
i
wont
buy
it
again
o
a
decent
barleywine
but
a
few
off
flavors
keep
it
from
becoming
a
great
one
probably
not
going
to
be
a
repeat
buy
for
me
good
not
much
for
oxidationaged
flavors
the
bourbon
works
in
a
subtle
way
for
a
bourbon
barrel
barleywine

i

this
is
something
that

the

the

theres
also
a

the

nothing

overall
a

with

cheers
in
all
a
very
good
beer
but
maybe
a
bit
to
high
on
hops
o
pretty
decent

barleywine
the
barrel
character
came
through
nicely
the
base
beer
however
seems
a
bit
weak
and
was
obscured
by
bitter
tannins
and
hop
notes
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
too
light
as
well
super
thick
and
chewy
effervescent
carbonation
sweet
vanilla
and
dark
fruits
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
with
mild
roasted
caramel
coffee
that
rides
onto
the
midpalate
these
subtle
flavors
explode
into
a
crescendo
of
giant
pungent
flavors
of
oak
bourbon
spice
and
alcohol
which
doesnt
so
much
attack
the
palate
as
it
does
kind
of
round
out
the
the
more
subtle
beginning
really
quite
a
ride
but
in
actuality
more
elegant
than
it
comes
off
but
that
could
be
the
touch
of
age
on
it
the
bourbon
barrel
influence
is
just
enough
to
compliment
the
other
flavors
in
the
beer
rather
than
attack
and
overpower
them
my
only
complaint
is
the
highly
noticeable
alcohol
content
but
at
11

its
hard
to
hide
extremely
complex
and
subtle

pretty
damn
good
poured
from

the

is
a

that
is

in
the
depths
no
head
to
speak
of
the
aromas
are
rich
and
malty
with
some
maple
and
tangy

a
subtle
boozey

along
with
an
overall
roasted
character
flavors
are
rich
and
layered
with
a

initially
followed
by
layers
of
rich
malty

including
some
leaning
towards
a

the
smooth

actually
kept
in
check
by
the
increased

roasted
richly
sweet

leads
into
a

this

one

the
most

i
have

i
love
that
it
is
a

that

wonderful
with
the

not

the
only
true

body
is
large

carbonation
especially
for
its

not
that
dry

very

this
brewery
is
really
impressive
going
to
hopefully
get
a
few
more
bottles
to
watch
develop
would
really
amaze
me
if
it
could
get
any
better
o
pretty
tasty
although
the
oakbourbon
are
almost
invisible
overall
this
is
excellent
fare
and
easily
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
tasted
especially
noteworthy
here
is
how
the
beer
doesnt
rely
exclusively
on
heavy

as
many

of

adds
ipalike
hops

o

much
better
draft

the
mouthfeel
is
reasonably
carbonated
but
not
too
much
nor
too
little
and
overall
this
is
one
of
the
great
beers
ive
ever
had
i
dont
think
i
would
give
5
0s
this
much
to
too
many
brews
but
this
one
seemed
to
deserve
it
o
this
is
a
good
barleywine
i
recommend
picking
one
up
for
a
11
brew
im
not
expecting
tons
of
carbonation
but
this
one
pours
very
lifeless
with
some
non
carbonation
bubbles
appearance
is
a
hazy
tawny
zero
head
zero
lacing
the
nose
features
a
rich
maltiness
with
shades
of
oak
and
molasses
the
bourbon
is
very
faint
and
contributes
nothing
more
than
a
mellow
vanilla
accent
at
the
end
the
taste
starts
off
very
malty
with
huge
notes
of
caramel
and
molasses
the
bourbon
makes
itself
more
present
as
the
taste
develops
on
the
palate
the
balance
is
impeccable
considering
the
weight
of
this
brew
there
is
no
burn
whatsoever
and
it
drinks
as
if
it
is
much
lighter
this
beer
suffers
in
the
mouthfeel
department
again
the
carbonation
is
nearly
nonexistent
which
hurts
the
over
all
quality
the
body
is
hefty
enough
overall
this
beer
tastes
as
if
it
is
a
fine
recipe
and
even
a
decent
bourbon
barrel
aged
version
of
one
but
in
its
current
form
i
am
quite
disappointed
a
decent
sipping
beer
for
a
cold
day
this
is
a
worthy
beer
but
far
short
of
its
early
promise
i
would
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
if
i
found
it
on
the
shelves

it
almost
reminded
me
of
the
first
time
i
had
angels
share
flavor
was
above
average
vanilla
barleywine
and
not
really
much
bourbon
at
all
this
tasted
decent
but
did
not
really
wow
me
for
13
id
rather
spend
a
couple
dollars
more
and
get
an
abacus
doa
o
barrel
qualities
shone
more
and
more
as
the
beer
warmed
i
cant
help
but
compare
to
the
abacus
i
reviewed
a
few
months
back
and
this
would
get
the
nod
from
me
fewer
distracting
barrel
notes
but
still
has
accents
from
the
aging
process
for
a
complex
beer
this
isnt
as
bourbon
forward
and
i
thank
uinta
for
that
poured
a
brawny

with
a
thick

that
lasts

left

to

abv
becomes
noticeable
at
the
end
and
this
beer
even
starts
to
warm
you
up
really
enjoyed
the
sweet

and
robust

balancing
and
the
touch
of
hops
as
well
o
not
the
most
balanced
brew
i
enjoyed
but
didnt
love
this
brew
i
much
prefer
their
labrynth
overall
i
liked
the
beer
but
thought
price
wise
it
wasnt
worth
it
paid
around

which
was
probably
too
much
its
a
decent
beer
but
im
admittedly
not
a
huge
fan
of

but
not
really
educated
enough
on
them
wish
there
was
more
bourbon
to
it
and
maybe
a
bit
more
of
something
which
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
uinta
makes
some
good
stuff
so
i
was
taken
back
a

ma
o
overall
i
like
that
this
beer
isnt
so
hopped
that
it
blows
the
bourbon
away
on
the
other
hand
this
doesnt
come
close
to
some
other
beer
that
are
stylistically
similar
it
is
a
very
good
beer
but
falls
just
short
of
great
i
will
say
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
some
more
of
the
bourbon
comes
out
with
a
touch
more
of
the
malt
flavor
i
really
like
well
either
this
beer
is
just
bad
or
it
cant
be
aged
in
the
cellar
for
1
year
because
it
tastes
like
shit
this
makes
me
wonder
if
i
should
cellar
barley
wines
anymore
o
not
really
worth
the
price
imo
maybe
for
a
pint
but
this
isnt
what
i
look
for
in
barleywine
of
this
price
range
drink
slow
a
very
smooth
and
tasty
barleywine
with
a
gentle
warming
hops
are
mellow
at
first
but
still
apparent
its
a
nice
balanced
flavor
easily
enjoyed
o
really
impressed
a
lot
like
the
alaskan
barleywine
with
bourbon
and
oak
notes
easily
the
best
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywine
ive
ever
tasted
twelve
bucks
for
a
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
that
you
can
grab
off
of
the
shelf
any
day
of
the
week
is
pretty
good
but
i
dont
know
if
i
will
be
buying
one
again
or
not
cockeyed
cooper
is
a
good
beer
though
overall
an
excellent
barleywine
rich
and
warming
recommended
tasty
barleywine
the
bourbon
is
not
overbearing
and
the
only
hopping
found
is
in
some
bittering
to
balance
this
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
but
big
barleywine
o
would
have
again
but
shared
next
time

this
is
a
very

through

no

with

a

taste
is
not
very
strong
at
all
there
is
the
natural
piney
hoppness
you
would
expect
from
a
barley
wine
but
not
too
strong
there
is
also
a
sugary
nuttiness
about
it
as
well
the
alcohol
is
there
and
that
keeps
this
a
sipper
it
is
actually
nicely
carbonated
and
not
harsh
going
down
has
the
warm
feeling
on
the
way
overall
an
ok
beer
that
fails
a
little
bit
on
balance
this
one
was
aged
for
about
8
months
and
even
so
the
hop
presence
remains
a
little
overwhelming
imo
the
yeast
selection
should
be
a
little
more
neutral
as
well
and
not
as
estery
d
it
was
not
as
easy
to
drink
cause
of
the
alcohol
content
but
it
was
really
tasty
and
had
a
nice
bourbon
balance
that
was
not
over
done

very
dry

overall
i
would
spring
for

anytime
this
is

and
definitely
worth
the

dvery
drinkable
for
an
11

nearly
an
apple
cider
appearance
but
with
a
red
tinge
to
it
because
i
used
a
small
snifter
i
didnt
give
this
a
very
vigorous
pour
and
as
such
it
didnt
render
much
of
a
head
the
nose
on
this
is
so
very
rich
and
bold
its
laden
with
notes
of
scorched
caramel
malt
roasted
figs
and
grape
distilled
wine
the
bourbon
and
woodiness
from
the
barrel
also
make
an
appearance
in
the
bouquet
i
poured
this
cold
so
ive
let
it
warm
up
to
allow
some
of
the
subtleties
to
liven
up
a
bit
the
taste
is
about
as
heavily
influenced
by
the
bourbon
barreling
as
any
beer
ive
had
heavy
on
bourbon
caramel
and
vanilla
as
a
person
who
also
appreciates
good
whiskey
this
is
almost
a
tweener
to
me
this
is
truly
a
sipper

feel
is

would

nice
to

this
one
in

the
aggressive
and

toning
down
it
really
drowns
everything

seems
to

an
enjoyable

this
is
way
hoppier
than
i
like
my
barleywines
still
it
was
a
great
beer
o
ive
decided
3years
is
perfect
age
for
this
that
lets
the
sweet
malty
backbone
shine
hides
the
alcohol
and
not
much
presence
of
oxidation
yet
when
properly
cellared
overall
this
barleywine
doesnt
live
up
to
the
promise
of
the
aroma
im
hoping
aging
improves
this
beer
and
the
sweetness
covers
the
paper
notes
from
stale
hops
overall
a
pretty
good
barleywine
this
is
a
fairly
fresh
2015
bottle
the
character
is
fairly
well
balanced
for
being
so
fresh
which
isnt
always
typical
of
barleywines
even
after
aging
a
little
over
2years
this
still
is
a
monster
of
an
ale
drinkability
is
only
limited
by
its
abv
a
sipper
for
sure
overall
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
had
the
alcohol
is
masked
nicely
behind
the
herbal
hoppiness
and
the
beer
isnt
a
sugar
bomb
a
nice
sipper
for
sure
i
loved
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
pineapple
forefront
with

after

smelt
and
felt

very
good
barleywine
not
as
hoppy
as
a
lot
of
american
styles
but
hoppy
enough
to
balance
out
the
heavy
malt
overall
very
balanced
very
good
flavor
and
aroma
worth
seeking
out

the

really
doing
it
for

the

are
there
too
along
with
dark

and
a

very

big
plus
for
me
with

f
heavy

not

which
i
like
with
my
barleywines
incredibly
smooth
and
dangerously
drinkable
o
living
in
southern
california
i
am
always
hesitant
to
say
that
i
love
stone
beers
considering
how
huge
they
are
nationwide
but
they
continue
to
come
out
with
beers
that
are
just
fantastically
well
made
this
is
one
of
them
especially
after
a
year
when
you
get
that
hop
flavor
and
the
bitterness
has
died
down
a
bit
really
tasty
very
drinkable
overall
a
really
good
beer
an
okay
american
barleywine
not
as
good
as
sn
bigfoot
or
anchors
old
foghorn
very
sweet
with
a
strong
boozey
finish
this
is
my
first
barleywine
and
i
think
im
hooked
thank
you
may
i
have
another
def
not
a
fan
tasted
like
old
malt
bomb
of
an
imperial
ipa
way
past
its
prime
smelled
much
better
than
it
tasted
really
good
awesome
taste
sweet
and
sour
best
barely
wine
ive
had
all
year
2015
is
good
but
obviously
needs
to
age
o
3
75
as
i
said
before
its
a
good
barely
wine
but
you
could
do
better
in
my
opinion
didnt
live
up
to
what
i
expected
but
was
good
nonetheless

kept

really
enjoyed
this
one
2013
release
aged
2
years
absolutely
amazing
with
age
old
guardian
is
seemingly
immortal
if
not
the
beer
itself
then
certainly
my
enjoyment
of
it
not
to
mention
the
fond
nostalgia
of
vintages
past
if
my
cellar
consisted
of
just
one
brand
itd
probably
be
this
one
to
my
knowledge
there
is
no
liquid
better
suited
to
moments
of
quiet
reflection
this
was
an
early
favourite
of
mine
and
one
that
i
continue
to
return
to
year
after
year
i
am
just
not
a
fan
of
barleywine

vintage

foamy
tan

a

up
very
nicely

a
few
years
bottle
of
2012
this

very

this
beer
doesnt

theres

great

another
great
beer
from
stone
purchased
in
vermont
8
for
a
bomber
one
of
the
finest
and
most
readily
available
american
barley
wines
out
there
like
with
most
stone
products
the
price
and
quality
are
right
2014
enjoyed
on
12414
so
hoping
it
gets
better
a
solid
caramel
malt
heavy
barleywine
overall
the
thing
i
most
dislike
in
many
of
the
stone
hopped
out
beers
their
assertive
stickiness
is
quadrupled
in
old
guardian
yet
i
find
myself
quite
enjoying
this
bottle
though
i
am
more
a
fan
of
english
barleywines
than
their
american
counterparts
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
first
class
interpretation
of
the
latter
style
yeah
this
is
exactly
what
i
thought
my
exposure
to
old
guardian
might
be
huge
on
every
side
and
vector
of
the
beer
spectrum
stone
does
not
disappoint
providing
a
tight
package
of
hightest
goodness
one
which
taken
in
larger
doses
will
certainly
get
you
tight
in
your
unworthy
drawers
overall
i
would
like
to
have
a
verticle
with
all
the
vintages
yet
right
now
i
know
it
ages
with
the
best
of
them
if
you
like
oxidation
in
your
brew
the
age
of
this
brew
has
hidden
the
high
gravity
of
the
brew
yet
its
oxidation
pulls
forth
some
favorable
characteristics
sherry
notes
i
like
yet
the
wet
cardboard
and
bleach
in
the
aroma
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
not
by
much
though
the
rest
of
the
flavor
of
the
brew
is
a
win
for
me
so
i
guess
its
not
a
total
loss
at
all
to
age
one
of
these
buggers
now
i
have
to
see
how
a
fresh
one
tastes
blah
blah
blah
this
brew
is
recommended
almost
a
gritty
quality
to
it
this
is
a
2012
bottle
very
sweet
almost
caramel
flavor
leaves
a
very
heavy
alcohol
bitter
flavor
would
exactly
call
this
highly
drinkable
but
not
a
bad
beer
would
be
interested
to
see
what
a
couple
more
years
would
do
maybe
help
mellow
it
out
a
little
overall
a
very
nice
abw
that
has
what
is
expected
high
ibus
a
waterfall
of
malts
and
a
burning
touch
reminiscent
of
an
old
friend
recommend
o
i
wanted
to
try
one
fresh
so
i
can
compare
it
to
one
that
ages
this
was
a
bit
hot
and
hoppy
which
i
hope
will
smooth
out
im
still
trying
to
decide
how
i
feel
about
some
of
the
extra
hoppy
american
barleywines
some
people
will
read
the
label
because
why
not
prost
huge
mouthfeel
on
this
one
carbonation
helps
balance
the
heavy
malt
great
barleywine
definitely
recommended
great
contrast
of
sweet
malt
and
bitter
hops
with
tart
fruity
hop
notes
countering
dark
fruit
nicely
its
a
little
hot
and
a
bit
bitter
for
my
liking
but
the
other
notes
redeem
it
very
well
o
the
age
on
this
makes
it
extra
special
a
treat
o
a
very
cool
rich
and
heavy
beer
not
something
to
drink
lightly
no
pun
intended
but
very
very
good
old
guardian
is
a
very
good
american
barleywine
that
certainly
doesnt
skimp
on
the
hops
the
alcohol
is
reasonably
hidden
when
its
cold
but
as
it
approaches
room
temperature
you
really
know
what
youre
getting
into
a
nice
beer
not
a
great
one
but
one
worth
trying
if
you
like
the
style
no
doubt
wtf
this
is
sooo
good
i
just
love
stone
how
the
h
do
they
always
deliver
pours
a
dark
red
with
creamy
head
about
a
finger
thick
smells
of
tropical
fruits
caramel
and
some
barley
really
inviting
tastes
of
mango
bananas
barley
and
some
hops
come
in
the
background
to
finish
things
off
alcohol
is
noticeable
a
bit
but
not
overpowering
a
fantastic
barleywine
hope
to
score
some
more
in
the
future
really
a
spot
on
barleywine
medium
body
perfect
blend
of
hops
and
hoppiness
balanced
fore
middle
and
aftertaste
this
is
the
best
beer
that
this
brewery
produces
their
other
stuff
is
for
ignoramuses
that
like
to
overspend
on
goofy
unbalanced
beer
but
this
stuff
right
here
nigga
this
stuff
right
here
othe
warmer
it
gets
or
the
more
i
drink
the
better
this
one
gets
never
been
much
of
a
barley
wine
person
but
this
one
hits
the
mark
this
was
awesome
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
overall
this
is
quite
a
booze
bomb
lively
hops
make
things
interesting
looking
back
at
prior
guardian
reviews
i
can
tell
my
palate
has
change
as
has
the
offerings
out
there
this
is
a
good
beer
worthy
of
a
shot
for
the
price
give
it
a
try
if
you
like
big
hoppy
beers
overall
unexciting
i
wrote
in
my
notes
that
it
hits
hard
take
from
that
what
you
will
o
very
solid
barley
wine
i
know
its
american
but
i
didnt
get
any
hop
character
what
so
ever
i
almost
thought
it
was
an
english
style
until
i
reread
the
label
it
could
have
been
the
bottle
or
my
pallet
could
have
been
off
go
get
this
one
o
behind
sierra
nevadas
bigfoot
stones
old
guardian
is
one
of
the
most
iconic
barleywines
the
states
has
to
offer
like
most
of
stones
brews
this
beast
is
big
and
bold
while
offering
deep
malt
and
hop
complexities
that
mingle
wonderfully
for
a
balanced
and
drinkable
brew
fresh
but
one
that
easily
ages
with
the
best
of
em
which
ive
put
to
the
test
time
and
again
a
very
nice
barley
wine
very
bitter
for
the
style
but
still
delicious
as

bottled

im
pretty
impressed
by
how
this
is
drinking
fresh
most
folks
cite
bigfoot
as
a
drink
fresh
barleywine
and
i
agree
but
this
one
deserves
more
mention
ill
have
to
buy
another
to
age
and
see
how
it
changes
from
this
review
looking
forward
to
it
overall
a
solid
good
beer
that
has
inclinations
toward
being
really
good
it
is
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
and
a
must
try
for
fans
of
american
barleywines
pours
out
a
rusty
orangey
red
with
a
thin
almost
not
there
head
smells
of
caramel
dates
toasty
malts
and
citruspine
sap
from
the
hops
i
pick
up
some
booze
as
well
taste
is
maltier
than
some
versions
from
other
years
sticky
dates
and
golden
raisins
citrus
and
earthy
hops
towards
the
finish
aftertaste
is
like
citrus
peel
candy
not
too
much
bitterness
or
alcohol
burn
compared
to
last
years
mouthfeel
is
sticky
mouthcoating
and
has
low
carbonation
they
did
a
great
job
with
old
guardian
this
year
which
has
always
been
a
hitormiss
barleywine
depending
on
the
year
i
might
have
to
get
a
few
more
bottles
than
id
planned
to
drink
more
of
it
fresh
instead
of
putting
it
away
to
age
o
an
excellent
brew
next
up
is
the
oaked
version
the
complexity
of
this
beer
astounds
me
the
flavor
takes
you
on
an
adventure
from
bitter
hoppiness
to
sweet
candy
to
thick
malt
its
an
awesome
barley
wine
rich
thick
and
full
of
caramel
this
could
probably
go
well
on
top
of
vanilla
ice
cream
theres
enough
hop
to
prevent
this
from
becoming
cloyingly
sweet
its
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
despite
the
11
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
chewy
poured
into
my
trusty
pint
glass
a
strong
copper
look
with
little
head
smells
of
barley
of
course
and
taste
of
strong
barley
and
hops
goes
down
fairly
easy
overall
a
great
beer
and
btw
i
had
the
2014
realease
of
this
beer
so
enjoy
this
delicous
treat
the
body
is
mediumfull
with
a
certain
richness
to
it
crispness
up
front
continuing
into
a
nippy
sort
of
smoothness
as
the
beer
takes
enough
dryness
for
a
semidry
finish
o
i
like
this
but
i
prefer
the
oaked
smoked
version
of
this
the
oak
mellows
it
out
this
is
its
out
of
control
sister
its
still
a
great
beer
and
i
will
have
it
again

its
definitely
a

the

sneaks
up
on
you
i
need
to
pick
up
another
bottle
and
let
it
age
some
o
i
like
this
beer
alot
for
the
price
and
wish
i
could
find
it
more
often
here
in
oregon
its
around
but
have
to
seek
it
out
overall
opinion
barley
wines
are
one
of
my
favored
styles
this
one
is
a
young
barley
wine
ale
impetuous
due
to
youth
and
an
abundance
of
hops
lacks
the
smooth
grace
and
characteristics
that
come
with
age
i
would
hope
for
the
hops
to
diminish
somewhat
being
tamed
in
company
of
the
malts
and
rendered
obedient
over
a
time
maybe
it
does
happen
that
way
maybe
it
doesnt
the
alcohol
reminds
you
that
it
is
present
for
duty
during
the
course
of
sipping
no
need
to
yell
whoa
as
it
is
just
warms
the
cheeks
after
a
while
this
is
not
an
unpleasant
ale
at
this
time
however
i
dont
believe
that
is
will
reach
its
prime
for
a
while
must
your
pair
it
with
a
meal
or
appetizer
for
it
to
be
a
suitable
quaff
no
it
is
good
enough
by
itself
right
now
most
importantly
is
this
an
ale
that
i
would
do
again
yes

the
aroma
of
this
beer
can
fool
you
because
you
would
expect
it
to
be
very
malty
and
sweet
but
lots
of
hop
bitterness
seemingly
comes
out
from
nowhere
in
the
taste
and
provides
a
nice
contrast
although
i
wouldnt
call
it
balanced
the
beer
is
rather
drinkable
considering
its
strength

warmed
the
bitterness
became
too
strong
for
my
palate
not
as
awesome
as
i
would
have
anticipated
but
a
solid
4
25
rated
beer
seemed
better
in
previous
years
overall
great
barleywine
very
satisfying
barleywine
on
the
cusp
of
but
just
missing
perfection
color
sweetness
and
heat
are
awesome
i
agree
with
comments
about
excessively
bitter
finish
though
available
in
4packs
of
12
oz
bottles
which
is
a
huge
plus
for
me
i
hate
that
barleywines
are
so
often
reserved
for
specialmarkup
bombers
will
definitely
purchase
at
least
twiceyear
if
available
this
one
was
ok
but
not
my
favorite
it
drank
more
like
an
ipa
to
me
and
i
normally
want
a
little
more
sweetness
in
a
barleywine
could
not
really
enjoy
this
one
very
surprised
the
bitterness
did
not
seem
to
be
balanced
by
the
malt
sweetness
making
this
one
bitter
mess
very
disapointed
by
this
one
i
love
great
divides
other
offerings
but
this
one
was
definately
not
for
me
ill
stick
to
collette
for
now
kind
of

curious

does

it

this
is
my
first
one
of
this
kind
not
my
favorite
kind
of
beer
but
this
is
good
the
hopforward
character
set
this
apart
it
smells
and
tastes
fruity
with
caramel
malty
sweets
the
bitterness
keeps
the
sugar
and
booze
in
check
nice
hoppy
finish
overall
what
an
american
barley
wine
should
taste
like
excellent
beer
smooth
drink
considering
its
over
10
abvs
2007
bottle
aged
beautifully
not
a
huge
hop
presence
but
very
well
balanced
and
mellow
if
you
like
american
style
bw
yes
you
must
try
this
very
bold
hopped
from
barely
brewed
one
of
the
best
ive
tried
was
surprised
by
the
hop
profile
and
slight
bitter
finish
a
great
barley
wine
for
sure
overall
not
as
blown
away
by
this
as
others
but
its
still
a
solid
barleywine
and
worthy
of
great
divides
reputation
just
not
a
game
changer
for
me
first
taste
is
an
expected
high
abv
beer
big
malt
sweet
nice
caramel
taste
but
coats
the
mouth
a
lot
what
i
will
call
a
very
typical
barley
wine
but
in
a
good
way
just
solid
hoppy
barley
wine
a
little
too
hoppy
for
my
taste
one
of
my
favorite
american
barley
wines
carbonation
is
spot
on
good
hop
profile
and
a
great
finish
2011
bottle
floral
malty

still
has
a
pretty
good
hop
flavor
after
3
years
overall
worth
the
try
but
not
my
favorite
barleywine
would
be
nice
to
try
after
a
couple
of
years
in
the

like
the

bitterness
is
actually

it

all
youll
get
is

sweetness
is
quickly
overcome
by
very

malty

happy
flavor
very
dry

excellent
early

beer
the
extra
hoppiness
and
heavy

does
an
excellent

o
i
am
a
lover
of
the
barleywine
and
old
ale
style
and
gd
hasnt
disappointed
here
a
tremendous
barley
wine
to
try
if
you
have
never
gotten
into
the
style
its
big
in
a
lot
of
ways
but
subtle
in
just
as
many
important
ways
tremendous
beer
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
into
a
mason
jar
beautiful
color
and
a
creamy
off
white
head
aroma
of
hops
and
dark
fruits
hits
the
nose
things
get
heavy
here
and
i
couldnt
get
much
else
no
matter
because
the
taste
is
awesome
and
although
hop
forward
it
has
some
levels
of
depth
with
the
overall
flavor
which
covers
the
abv
very
well
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
at
first
sip
and
changes
on
the
tongue
to
medium
almost
light
and
then
finishing
a
solid
medium
the
tongue
takes
a
journey
here
but
it
should
with
a
good
barley
wine
style
ale
overall
a
very
solid
and
enjoyable
brew
glad
i
picked
it
up
and
would
grab
it
again
great
divide
brewing
co
turns
out
some
nice
stuff
overall
not
as
hop
forward
as
the
label
details
yet
it
doesnt
lack
hops
either
this
is
more
balanced
than
big
foot
enough
of
that
gibberish
everything
in
this
is
delicious
the
booze
is
more
present
in
the
aroma
than
in
the
taste
this
is
recommended
o
a
classically
done
american
barleywine
all
around
solid
one
of
a
handful
to
look
to
as
a
measuring
stick
for
the
style
the
age
on
this
one
has
rounded
it
out
beautifully
overall
pretty
good
and
tasty
for
a
young
barley
wine
good
sweetness
a
bit
too
much
astringency
and
herbalness
though
this
barleywine
really
strikes
a
chord
with
me
rough
with
harsh
hoppiness
around
the
edges
and
mightily
malty
underneath
o
this
is
probably
my
favorite
barely
wine
to
date
incredible
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
barleywine
many
are
either
too
sweet
or
just
a
pure
pack
of
burning
booze
this
one
is
fantastically
balanced
and
drinkable
with
great
flavor
feel
and
aroma
i
would
recommend
this
is
a
solid
and
quite
delicious
barleywine
that
starts
simple
but
opens
up
to
be
a
relatively
complex
experience
tmo
about
online
with
my
rating
although
i
think
the
hops
is
a
little
more
forward
i
kinda
expected
this
in
a
fresher
batch
a
slight
boozy
smell
to
this
one
which
im
sure
has
been
balanced
by
the
year
and
a
half
its
been
aging
on
my
local
stores
shelf
i
love
that
i
can
taste
the
hops
almost
as
if
theres
an
oakaged
ipa
hiding
in
here
delicious
im
looking
forward
to
killing
this
bomber
overall
one
of
those
barleywines
that
might
be
best
while
fresh
because
the
hop
profile
is
a
thing
of
beauty
though
i
wouldnt
mind
scoring
a
bottle
at
some
point
in
the
future
just
to
see
how
well
it
ages
gets
a
bit
sweeter
as
it
warms
and
frankly
i
better
loved
the
layered
complexity
it
showed
when
first
opened
but
its
a
hell
of
a
barelywine
all
the
same
overall
a
nice
american
barleywine
that
has
improved
and
mellowed
with
age
rich
complex
but
not
complicated
tasty
this
is
absolutely
one
of
my
favorite
barely
wine
overall
great
barleywine
i
recently
bought
six
bottles
of
one
of
my
top
three
barlewyines
and
would
have
it
tomorrow
to
compare
drink
up
and
enjoy
salud
othis
is
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
the
flavors
tend
toward
simple
and
drinkable
instead
of
huge
or
complex
or
mindblowing
normally
a
welldone
beer
like
this
would
not
be
a
problem
but
in
a
barleywine
that
is
10plus
percent
abv
i
want
my
mind
to
be
a
little
blown
simplicity
notwithstanding
this
is
a
goodlooking
example
of
the
style
and
it
drinks
easy
a
good
fireside
apres
ski

o
oh
man
this
is
a
killer
barleywine
not
only
is
it
luxurious
and
complex
its
surprisingly
drinkable
and
not
overly
sweet
which
is
a
problem
even
in
good
barleywines
actually
i
overstated
its
drinkability
if
only
because
i
want
to
savor
every
last
drop
of
it
the
beer
pours
an
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
some
very
noticeable
lacing
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
ruby
with
hints
of
purple
the
beer
is
very
clear
and
see
through
the
beer
has
a
strong
notes
of
barley
with
lighter
dark
fruit
notes
that
resemble
raisin
with
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
the
beer
taste
is
slightly
different
the
barley
notes
are
weaker
than
the
dark
fruit
notes
also
the
beer
has
a
slight
strawberry
tartiness
the
dark
fruit
notes
are
raisin
with
a
bit
of
plum
the
beer
is
heavybodied
with
a
smooth
feel
and
biting
carbonation
overall
a
fantastic
barleywine
and
worth
drinking
a
copper
colored
pour
with
a
thin
white
head
that
leaves
intricate
lacing
as
i
drink
the
smell
is
very
malty
but
i
get
a
significant
busrt
of
hops
on
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
mirrors
the
smell
with
sweet
caramel
malt
coming
first
followed
by
a
bitter
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
almost
silky
and
the
carbonation
is
just
right
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
success
i
was
interested
when
i
heard
hop
forward
barleywine
and
great
divide
never
ceases
to
impress
bravo
overall
i
really
like
this
one
i
didnt
think
hoppy
barleywines
existed
until
now
definitely
will
seek
this
out
for
the
future
overall
wow
holding
up
incredibly
well
this
tastes
fantastic
wish
i
had
a
few
more
bottles
from
2010
or
from
any
year
o
one
of
the
more
flavorful
barleywines
ive
had
without
being
overwhelmingly
sweet
or
thick
the
hop
character
is
a
little
off
for
me
id
like
to
try
one
with
a
bit
of
age
on
it
overall
i
dont
usually
seek
out
barley
wines
but
this
one
will
open
my
eyes
to
the
style
i
had
this
at
a
share
with
over
5
years
on
it
with
the
old
old
label
the
beer
still
drinks
wonderfully
as
the
dried
fruits
shine
through
along
with
the
wonderful
mouthfeel
and
toffee
sweetness
this
beer
has
o
could
have
had
a
better
mouthfeel
and
more
fruit
complexity
in
a
word
overrated
way
overrated
but
still
good
and
still
worth
a
try
recommended
o
awesome
beer
and
awesome
style
great
divide
always
makes
some
good
stuff
and
this
is
one
of
their
best
old
ruffian
is
a
great
no
holds
barred
bwine
a
real
treat
for
the
senses
dont
pass
it
up
overall
a
robust
and
unique
barleywine
that
is
very
wellbalanced
great
stuff
overall
it
comes
together
to
forge
an
exceptional
barley
wine
ale
the
lower
abv
gives
it
a
bit
more
drinkability
imo
aftertaste
is
going
to
give
you
hops
for
days
waiting
for
that
next
sip
great
beer
glad
to
have
found
it
finally
fabulous
beer
opened
with
a
blast
of
caramel
to
my
nose
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
modest
thick
slightly
slow
to
settle
creamlight
tan
colored
head
and
some
lace
color
is
a
brown
orange
amber
thats
a
tad
hazy
with
the
pouring
came
some
heady
wafts
of
fresh
hop
flavor
is
outstanding
tang
and
bitter
up
front
tang
drops
off
very
slightly
sweet
lots
of
resin
a
little
citrus
body
is
excellent
and
while
carbonation
is
a
touch
soft
it
doesnt
seem
to
hurt
finish
is
like
flavor
lots
of
booze
and
long
great
beer
for
sipping
andor
sharing
o
a
little
disappointing
the
flavor
could
use
a
little
more
depth
and
complexity
and
the
body
was
surprisingly
thin
its
possible
the
bottle
didnt
age
well
so
i
will
definitely
be
trying
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
beer
as
soon
as
i
can
o
for
reasons
beyond
a
review
this
beer
to
me
remains
a
personal
favorite
the
folks
at
great
divide
sure
know
how
to
create
a
great
cellarable
brew
between
this
and
their
yeti
offerings
i
may
safely
say
they
have
quenched
this
reviewers
cravings
for
a
masterfully
crafted
american
barleywine
and
imperial
stout

o
i
am
drinking
a
fig
newton
soaked
in
booze
excellent
barley
wine
o
surprisingly
smooth
for
a
barley
wine
style
ale
with
a
nice
strong
hop
flavor
that
i
would
not
expect
for
this
style
complex
very
well
balanced
and
delightful
to
drink
poured
a
lovely
rosey
copper
with
a
nice
thick
head
very
pretty
lacing
as
i
sip
pleasantly
sweet
nose
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
maybe
toffee
taste
follows
right
in
line
with
the
smell
just
stronger
nice
and
rich
bold
even
but
manages
to
do
so
without
feeling
the
slightest
bit
heavy
smooth
and
filling
in
the
mouth
warms
as
it
goes
down
everything
i
love
about
a
barley
wine
personally
i
will
note
that
i
pulled
it
out
to
sit
a
good
3040
minutes
before
i
poured
it
and
i
dont
think
it
would
have
been
nearly
as
good
right
out
the
fridge
sipping
slowly
its
only
gotten
better
as
it
warms
overall
this
one
is
going
straight
to
the
top
of
my
list
great
divide
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
and
this
is
no
exception
wonderful
brew
this
is
rich
and
dense
the
flavors
are
quite
robust
and
not
overly
heavy
it
is
fairly
smooth
and
very
pleasant
great
divide
has
become
one
of
my
top
breweries
if
you
are
only
going
to
read
one
line
of
this
review
buy
and
drink
fresh
do
not
age
despite
the
slight
booziness
and
high
alcohol
the
beer
is
smooth
as
silk
and
drinks
pleasantly
smooth
this
is
a
great
barleywine
and
one
i
must
find
more
of
a
pretty
heady
and
uncompromising
instance
of
the
style
nothing
ventured
nothing
gained
i
suppose
big
caramel
variances
bludgeoned
hops
up
the
yinyang
and
boozy
orchard
fruit
notes
to
match
good
stuff
overall
i
cannot
deny
as
all
that
sturm
und
drang
seems
to
wash
out
well
enough
in
a
selfflagellating
sense
of
the
term
prost
o
hmph
interesting
i
wonder
how
hoppy
this
is
when
fresh
its
got
plenty
of
hop
flavor
even
after
2
years
which
is
saying
something
nice
hoppy
barleywine
balanced
with
quite
a
malt
wallop
honestly
reminds
me
of
bigfoot
a
lot
big
belly
warming
and
tasty
one
of
the
best
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
barleywine
its
probably
the
hoppiest
one
ive
had
as
well
even
more
than
lower
de
boom
from
21st
ammendment
a
great
beer
that
just
gets
better
as
i
sit
here
sipping
it
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
overall
this
may
be
my
new
favourite
beer
perfectly
balanced
and
delicious
the
sweetness
and
bitterness
are
bang
on
and
drink
great
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
as
well
carbonation
is
low
hop
bitterness
does
outlast
the
sticky
sweetness
actually
sticky
in
an
earthy
resinous
sense
drying
feel
and
has
a
elegant
creamyness
and
very
large
indeed
this
is
a
bbb
big
beautiful
beer
a
nice
brew
to
sip
upon
knowing
full
well
i
couldnt
do
it
for
long
in
public
bad
things
would
happen
definitely
a
classic
american
barleywine
overall
a
very
good
barleywine
one
of
the
better
american
versions
out
there
big
and
bold

this
had
about
6
months
on
it
which
took
down
a
bit
of
the
holiness
in
a
very
good
way
o
this
is
a
good
barelywine
but
no
where
near
a
94
or
a
100
imo
first
time
trying
it
having
a
2012
6
months
old
next
to
a
2010
a
sipper
with
only
a
few
months
on
it
still
has
a
significant
hop
profile
but
once
the
ibus
diminish
over
time
this
stuff
goes
down
real
easy
grab
a
few
bottles
and
hide
them
for
a
few
years
great
brew
cheers
pours
deep
red

with
a
nice

looking

aroma
of

with
some

citrus
drinks
easy
for
the
style
with
big
malt
balanced
out
by
bitter
citrus
a
lingering
bitter
left
on
the
palate
somehow
both
malt
and
hops
really
shine
equally
here
lighter
mouthfeel
not
light
but
more
than
expected
with
adequate
carbonation
not
a
heavy
super
sweet
barleywine
but
a
nice
warming
brew
o
very
nice
perhaps
a
bit
too
hop
forward
for
my
taste
but
a
solid
barley
wine
none
the
less
overall
lots
of
malt
and
hop
character
that
youd
expect
in
an
american
barleywine
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
this
is
worth
try
overall
a
good
american
barley
wine
but
unbalanced
perhaps
the
december
2011
brew
date
was
past
its
prime
i
prefer
the
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
which
has
a
more
balanced
taste
profile
and
thats
from
less
than
50
reviews
thats
over
35
different
flavors
seriously
im
sorry
but
this
is
just
craziness

very
impressive
o

barley
wine
o
a
fantastic

wine
savory
and
only
semisweet
hopforward
and
bitter
overall
as
awesome
bw
this
is
why
barleywines
are
probably
my
favorite
style
i
am
jelous
for
the
people
that
can
get
this
regularly
especially
on
tap
i
am
sad
to
say
that
i
do
not
have
an
unaged
bottle
to
compare
to
at
2
14
years
old
this
one
is
amazing
overall
the
beer
is
warming
complex
and
has
an
assertive
hoppiness
my
only
criticism
is
that
the
hops
do
not
play
well
with
the
malt
background
they
come
off
as
harsh
o
great
looking
barleywine
with
a
strong
smell
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
quite
alcoholic
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
not
exactly
what
i
had
in
mind
when
i
read
barley
wine
but
then
again
it
also
does
say
hoppy
on
the
bottle
so
i
guess
the
bottles
description
is
rite
on
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
from
notes
102810
11
month
old
bottle
this
beer
could
use
some
more
time
right
now
its
sticky
kinda
boozy
and
harsh
there
are
some
nice
caramel
notes
lurking
in
there
but
its
just
not
all
that
enjoyable
right
now
aroma
is
caramel
malt
and
citric
hops
sweet
sugar
cane
apricots
and
an
acetonemetal
note
also
show
up
the
taste
is
sweet
leading
to
harsh
lots
of
caramel
malt
flavor
is
packed
into
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
fairly
sticky
appearance
is
a
darkened
amber
with
an
offwhite
to
beige
head
at
any
rate
i
imagine
a
vintage
bottle
would
get
higher
marks
also
im
sorta
down
on
barleywines
right
now
so
ill
give
this
one
another
try
in
the
future
personal
rate
4
5
hazy
tawny
copper
with
maple
hues
very
light
head
beautiful
aromas
of
lemon
zest
and
grapefruit
rind
but
not
overwhelming
the
delicate
raisin
and
figs
coming
through
the
rich
maltiness
very
well
balanced
but
expressive
full
bodied
rich
yet
a
bit
of
dryness
in
the
finish
o
wonderful
bw
will
be
looking
forward
to
this
with
some
more
age
on
it
wanted
to
try
it
fresh
first
but
have
a
few
cellared
for
future
consumption
if
it
is
this
wonderful
now
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
it
develops
into
overall
right
away
i
have
to
say
that
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
with
a
year
on
this
than
fresh
a
year
ago
dont
get
me
wrong
this
a
great
barley
wine
when
it
is
fresh
but
i
believe
that
this
is
much
more
enjoyable
when
the
fruit
malt
and
hops
are
equal
to
each
other
the
roughedged
characteristics
smooth
out
and
roundoff
the
overall
complexities
increase
and
the
alcohol
nearly
disappears
this
is
a
topnotch
barley
wine
that
i
will
recommend
to
anybody
that
is
a
fan
of
the
style
add
a
couple
bottles
to
your
cellar
and
be
amazed
at
what
a
year
or
more
can
do
to
a
barley
wine
im
gonna
come
right
out
with
it
this
is
my
first
barleywine
ale
so
not
totally
sure
what
to
expect
it
pours
nicely
and
came
away
with
a
34
head
that
disappated
in
a
couple
of
minutes
leaving
larger
soapylooking
bubbles
beautiful
redorange
in
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
and
also
totally
clarified
id
expected
some
suspended
bits
or
murkiness
in
there
but
theres
nothing
i
can
see
right
through
to
the
other
side
of
the
glass
it
initially
smells
overwhelmingly
like
red
vines
to
me
oddly
then
breaks
up
into
fig
strawberry
cherry
chapstick
and
molasses
flowery
very
sweet
no
noticeable
alcohol
on
the
nose
and
some
underlying
yeast
im
really
just
bowled
over
by
the
nose
definitely
a
lot
there
tasting
exposes
the
alcohol
as
well
as
some
hop
bitters
and
i
very
much
get
strawberries
cherries
and
molasses
honestly
im
not
superpsyched
about
the
flavor
its
really
good
but
ive
had
some
winter
ales
hibernation
being
one
go
figure
that
are
similar
and
i
was
just
hoping
for
something
different
mouthfeel
is
what
youd
expect
from
a
big
brew
like
this
but
its
well
done
and
not
so
punchy
as
you
might
think
its
actually
pretty
smooth
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
very
complex
aromas
and
flavors
and
ill
definitely
be
investigating
this
style
more
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
though
it
is
enjoyable
fairly
priced
at
8
for
a
bomber
here
and
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
if
you
like
barleywine
definitely
try
this
one
ok
barleywine
and
for
the
price
and
availability
probably
worth
it
not
something
i
seek
out
all
that
often
though
solid
barleywine
and
very
approachable
for
what
it
is
not
overwhelmingly
intense
but
proficiently
balanced
if
this
were
available
locally
it
would
easily
be
a
go
to
for
the
style
certainly
one
of
the
most
balanced
and
refined
american
barleywines
ive
yet
to
sample
o
this
is
a
world
class
example
of
an
american
barleywine
its
hopped
to
high
hell
and
that
i
like
keep
in
mind
my
review
is
of
a
13
month
old
bottle
thanks
to
baybum
for
this
one
a
solid
sipping
beer
but
i
wish
i
hadnt
gotten
the
full
pint
a
decent
barleywine
but
couldnt
get
by
that
lingering
bitterness
this
was
a
2011
batch
so
i
will
age
my
other
bottle
and
see
what
happens
o
4
i
drank
these
all
the
time
in
collage
and
a
decade
later
im
still
happy
to
drink
this
beer
cheers
to
the
brewers
to
hold
up
the
standard
for
so
long
o
this
barleywine
is
quite
easy
to
drink
considering
its
strength
because
any
traces
of
alcohol
are
well
hidden
from
the
taste
it
is
also
very
well
balanced
between
the
malts
and
hops
overall
such
a
smooth
barleywine
with
a
ton
of
flavour
yet
not
overbearing
really
enjoying
this
o
even
with
a
year
of
age
its
still
a
sipping
beer
but
man
is
smooth
normally
id
be
more
than
happy
to
enjoy
this
in
all
of
its
young
aggressive
hop
forward
glory
but
a
little
bit
of
age
smooths
the
rough
edges
and
tamps
down
the
hops
this
beer
would
pair
well
with
a
steak
but
ill
be
matching
it
with
a
reuben
for
tonights
dinner
what
a
wonderful
beer
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
thick
tan
colored
head
that
lingers
an
exceptionally
long
time
really
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
pours
of
a
beer
i
have
seen
aroma
is
of
toffee
butterscotch
liquorice
caramel
with
lots
of
floral
and
herbal
notes
from
the
hops
to
balance
it
out
flavor
is
just
what
i
would
expect
with
a
barleywine
sweet
and
bitter
with
fire
from
the
high
alcohol
content
mouthfeel
is
heavy
with
moderate
carbonation
and
an
abundance
of
fire
from
the
alcohol
overall
this
is
now
my
favorite
barleywine
and
that
is
saying
a
lot
overall
great
divide
never
ceases
to
impress
this
is
a
top
notch
barelywine
with
lots
of
goodness
going
on
and
a
full
creamy
body
to
support
it
all
its
too
bad
these
guys
decided
to
stop
exporting
to
europe
as
they
were
a
staple
in
my
beer
fridge
good
stuff
here
and
available
all
the
time
in
the
usa
great
atmosphere
nice
coloration
topped
with
a
tight
foamy
head
and
persistent
thick
lacing
nose
autumn
spice
baked
bread
with
some
floral
notes
flavor
is
bready
with
plenty
of
sweet
and
bitter
components
balanced
against
each
other
full
body
and
flavor
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
o
a
very
nice
but
extremely
bitter
barleywine
i
could
use
a
bit
more
malt
complexity
too
o
not
bad
but
there
are
much
better
barleywines
out
there
i
liked
the
smell
and
the
first
few
sips
a
lot
but
i
wont
be
paying
8
for
another
bottle
any
time
soon
d
for
a
barleywine
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
in
this
one
could
easily
sneak
up
on
you
with
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
overall
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
beer
but
i
have
another
bottle
i
will
age
for
another
couple
of
years
and
i
think
then
it
will
be
awesome
i
think
this
needs
some
time
to
mellow
it
was
bottled
in
december
2011
so
two
years
from
now
i
expect
it
to
be
spectacular
but
for
now
its
just
a
little
too
hoppy
and
boozy
for
my
preference
will
pick
it
up
again
overall
a
really
enjoyable
and
tasty
american
style
barleywine
the
hop
character
has
held
up
incredibly
well
and
adds
a
nice
counterpoint
to
the
caramel
and
molasses
notes
from
the
malt
everything
i
look
for
in
a
hoppy
barleywine
a
real
treat
to
be
able
to
find
this
on
the
shelves
easily
very
good
taste
is
of
sweet
vanilla
malts
some
dried
date
caramel
and
lots
of
hops
its
a
little
too
bitter
and
the
alcohol
burns
a
bit
but
its
not
bad
its
a
really
nice
barleywine
but
not
my
favorite
maybe
some
aging
would
mellow
this
out
o
hands
down
one
of
my
favorite
barley
wine
style
beers
fantastic
o
one
of
those
rare
beers
where
i
liked
the
taste
but
was
just
alright
with
the
nose
maybe
that
says
something
about
the
age
of
the
beer
looking
into
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
i
can
see
that
this
beer
was
not
bottleconditioned
its
a
possibility
so
ill
be
looking
out
for
fresh
bottles
this
december
www
dudeletter
comp937
this
has
held
up
well
for
over
2
years
ive
never
had
it
fresh
but
ill
happily
drink
it
again
a
thick
sweet
malty
treat
went
to
a
friends
house
and
he
pulled
this
one
out
of
the
fridge
surprised
ive
never
had
this
one
before
poured
my
allotment
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
thin
beige
head
on
top
notes
of
herbs
hops
citrus
toffee
the
mouth
is
creamy
and
smooth
slightly
syrupy
feel
on
the
back
end
semisweet
syrup
molasses
mild
bittering
hops
bitter
citrus
rind
really
a
good
beer
definitely
an
evening
sipper
overall
not
a
good
example
given
2010
bottling
even
more
of
a
let
down
overall
a
sensationally
tasting
barleywine
with
just
the
right
blending
of
sweet
malts
and
bitter
hops
overall
really
big
lots
of
flavors
and
a
big
more
hoppy
then
most
it
takes
you
on
a
ride
of
flavors
malty
hoppy
sugary
bitter
hoppy
alcoholish
yet
balanced
and
fun
to
drink
excellent
example
of
a
well
done
american
barleywine
great
to
enjoy
fresh
would
love
to
try
aged
worthy
a
drink
for
sure
overall
very
good
but
a
little
disappointing
its
complex
but
doesnt
seem
to
play
well
with
itself
some
of
the
flavors
just
compete
originally
reviewed
01092011
ocould
be
a
bit
better
if
the
flavors
didnt
clash
so
much
initially
probably
just
needs
more
age
o
fantastic
american
barleywine
while
hard
to
drink
in
general
its
a
gentle
barley
wine
the
sweetness
from
the
red
fruit
and
the
malt
tempers
the
bitterness
still
hard
to
chug
but
relatively
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
o
im
just
not
crazy
about
this
one
the
hops
are
pretty
aggressive
for
the
malt
on
this
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
hops
and
the
booziness
seems
a
bit
harsh
maybe
its
just
at
an
awkward
age
but
it
seems
unbalanced
right
now
ill
have
to
try
a
bottle
a
few
years
out
overall
i
feel
that
the
beer
is
a
bit
too
strong
for
its
own
good
but
its
a
good
barley
wine
very
rich
on
the
hops
i
wouldve
preferred
if
the
tender
malt
and
sweetness
that
i
got
from
the
aroma
wouldve
been
more
present
but
theyre
now
overwhelmed
by
the
strong
hops
a
good
beer
though
no
doubt
about
it
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
american
barleywine
exactly
what
it
claims
on
the
bottle
hefty
and
hoppy
similar
to
say
bigfoot
but
not
quite
as
complex
as
doggie
claws
this
would
be
a
nice

sweet

faint

it
doesnt

too
much
a
great
smelling
beer
i
am
guessing
that
i
am
probably
sniffing
the
remnants
of
the
hops
vanilla
is
also
present
taste
whoa
cocoa
roasted

vanilla
this
is
mellow
and
delicous
and
i
am
amazed
at
the
surprising
chocolate
and
creme
brule
taste
profile
the
hops
have
mellowed
and
the
malt
has
developed
a
very
nice
complex
profile
for
the
abv
i
get
no
booze
at
all
in
fact
its
scary
how
quick
this
can
go
down
ive
had
this
beer
fresh
and
its
abrasive
and
super
hoppy
in
fact
i
didnt
like
it
fresh
this
is
great
though
i
was
glad
to
try
it
thanks

brown

pine

is
all
of

then
the
nose
would
have
you

body
is
large
wonderful
amount
of

more
lush
than
dry
and
very
drinkable
for
its
large
body
and
abv
this
is
my
new
favorite
non
barrel
aged
barleywine
wow
is
this
is
special
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
barleywines
out
there
not
quite
up
to
the
level
of
the
alaskan
barleywine
which
i
consider
the
top
but
really
close
really
nice
flavor
profile
pinecitrus
bitterness
to
complement
the
sweet
carameltoffee
maltiness
just
a
great
showing
overall
this
beer
once
again
helps
to
prove
my
theory
that
american
barleywines
peak
at
2
years
of
age
so
i
will
continue
to
follow
that
practice
of
waiting
until
that
maturity
date
to
sample
going
forward
and
recommend
all
to
do
the
same
for
maximum
enjoyment
definitely
a
must
try
for
fans
of
the
style
and
another
high
quality
brew
from
great
divide
o
alcohol
is
quite
strong
a
tad
too
much
in
my
opinion
i
prefer
bigfoot
over
this
one
an
offbeat
barleywine
thats
pretty
good
but
in
my
opinion
overrated
on
ba
pours
a
mostly
clear
amber
color
with
a
good
fluffy
white
head
smells
like
fruity
wood
maybe
cherry
or
apple
wood
plenty
of
hops
in
the
nose
as
well
more
than
the
style
usually
presents
there
is
also
the
smell
of
redamber
malts
in
this
one
caramel
and
toffee
sweetness
flavor
is
a
compliment
to
the
nose
very
similar
profile
long
long
bitter
finish
here
and
a
shocking
alcohol
burn
the
feel
is
good
if
a
bit
too
boozed
up
but
theres
good
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
on
it
overall
its
complexity
and
strength
make
it
a
nice
barleywine
but
im
not
as
blown
away
as
some
other
reviewers
overall
pretty
good
and
reasonably
priced
i
would
still
pass
in
favor
of
middle
ages
druid
fluid
if
i
could
get
it
in
my
area
still
its
a
solid
beer
and
better
than
this
years
bigfoot
ill
definitely
pick
it
up
again
at
some
point
overall
it
starts
out
strong
in
terms
of
hoppiness
before
balancing
out
into
a
nice
sweet
tasting
barleywine
pair
that
along
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
you
get
a
winning
combination
o
its
big
so
sips
are
required
for
me
excellent
beer
especially
at
6
for
a
22
oz
ill
have
to
try
this
again
to
see
if
the
nutty
flavor
is
still
there
i
love
bws
and
if
you
like
tom
hardy
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
and
a
relatively
high
abv
10
2
i
want
wondering
why
i
was
feeling
so
fuzzy
youll
definitely
enjoy
this
one
overall
theres
just
too
much
strength
here
for
the
flavor
profile
the
flavor
is
good
but
even
for
a
barleywine
its
got
too
much
alcohol
o
i
love
beers
like
this
this
whole
bomber
is
going
to
last
a
really
long
time
worth
the
8
dollars
in
my
honest
opinion
its
a
little
malt
forward
but
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
and
are
expecting
it
than
your
in
for
a
treat
o
a
decent
barleywine
not
the
best
on
the
shelf
still
enjoyed
it
though
overall
very
good
very
enjoyable
and
great
on
a
cold
day
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
bottled
on
12
5
12
this
pours
a
brownish
color
with
a
massive
lace
leaving
tan
head
the
smells
are
of
toasted
malts
caramel
and
a
nice
little
bit
of
pine
hops
and
dark
fruit
the
feel
is
thick
the
taste
is
pretty
good
a
load
of
bitter
hops
nuts
caramel
and
toasted
malts
excellent
im
glad
i
bought
this
today
i
was
looking
for
the
12
bigfoot
but
this
is
a
fine
alternative
unfortunately
this
beer
is
very
one
note
too
alcoholic
and
lacks
any
sweetness
whatsoever
despite
the
fact
its
supposed
to
be
a
barleywine
dunno
if
this
is
a
bad
bottle
or
what
overall
a
great
barley
wine
will
age
well
resulting
in
more
present
darker
fruits
o
this
has
really
good
drinkability
it
is
smooth
and
full
of
flavor
overall
it
is
a
great
beer
and
it
is
a
very
nice
example
of
an
american
barleywine
the
flavor
is
really
nice
and
it
has
a
good
hop
presence
also
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
for
being
10
2
i
recommend
trying
it
out
it
is
an
excellent
beer
and
i
would
buy
it
again
the
price
point
isnt
bad
either
22
ounce
bottle
unfortunately
the
date
on
the
label
is
smudged
but
i
think
it
says
it
was
bottled
sometime
in
november
2010
ive
had
the
bottle
for
at
least
a
year
so
i
think
thats
the
correct
bottling
date
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
dark
reddishamber
color
with
about
a
half
inch
light
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
the
brew
smells
like
dark
fruit
prunes
raisins
brown
sugar
pine
hops
caramel
malt
and
some
sherry
for
the
most
part
it
tastes
just
like
the
aroma
but
theres
also
a
slight
bitter
taste
that
i
dont
care
for
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
hoppy
bitter
flavor
there
just
seems
something
a
little
bit
off
about
it
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
chewy
and
has
good
carbonation
overall
i
think
its
a
good
enough
brew
ill
have
to
try
this
again
in
the
future
maybe
a
fresher
or
older
bottle
will
be
better
the
beer
is
no
thicker
or
heavier
than
youd
expect
for
the
style
and
theres
not
nealry
as
much
alcohol
burn
as
there
should
be
well
done
great
divide
cheers
o
another
solid
beer
from
great
divide
this
is
my
first
time
having
this
beer
and
i
can
tell
that
ill
like
this
one
more
with
a
few
years
on
it
overall
i
love
how
drinkable
this
is
a
farmers
beer
let
me
say
so
barnyardy
the
age
adds
interest
to
it
and
it
is
really
balanced
some
hops
and
funk
on
the
mix
not
the
most
outrageous
barleywine
in
the
world
but
damn
good
this
is
a
well
built
barleywine
this
will
also
keep
the
dipa
vs
barleywine
conversation
going
the
flavor
is
fantastic
and
i
bet
some
time
will
calm
the
hops
and
marry
the
flavors
a
little
the
alcohol
is
buried
and
only
really
shows
up
in
the
finish
and
in
the
warmth
of
the
mouthfeel
its
drinkabe
maybe
dangerously
so
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
o
it
is
a
good
barleywine
along
the
lines
of
old
horizontal
and
third
coast
old
ale
mouthfeeloverall
mediumfull
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
a
bit
prickly
the
beer
definitely
does
drink
to
its
10
2
mark
the
alcohol
is
definitely
noticeable
overall
a
pretty
good
barleywine
i
tend
to
enjoy
the
malty
barleywines
more
so
while
i
enjoyed
this
i
didnt
love
it
still
have
to
recognize
it
for
a
solid
beer
of
its
style
would
like
to
try
one
of
these
thats
aged
even
more
for
comparisons
sake
overall
this
is
the
best
barleywine
that
i
have
had
to
date
everything
about
this
beer
is
amazing
great
nose
great
taste
excellent
mouthfeel
i
have
to
find
some
more
of
these
definitely
pick
up
a
bottle
if
you
come
across
well
worth
it
this
is
possibly
the
quintessential
barleywine
in
the
american
style
this
is
a
hoppy
barleywine
almost
reminded
me
of
a
dipa
but
it
stays
true
to
style
and
is
very
very
tasty
recommended
a
well
balanced
beer
this
barleywine
has
a
great
malt
presence
with
a
nice
bitter
hoppiness
the
roasted
malt
taste
is
reminiscent
of
cola
or
root
beer
and
nicely
conceals
the
alcohol
the
hops
are
a
good
accompaniment
that
dont
overwhelm
i
was
expecting
more
sweetness
but
am
impressed
with
this
beer
ill
need
to
pick
a
few
bottles
up
for
aging
pours
a
beige
head
which
is
very
thick
the
body
is
brown
garnet
in
color
the
smell
is
very
malty
with
a
floral
and
cake
aroma
smells
lead
into
the
flavor
with
a
juicy
fruit
pine
taste
and
a
middle
sip
alcohol
burn
this
beer
really
takes
you
on
a
journey
medium
and
slick
mouthfeel
just
a
classic
representation
of
the
style
and
a
very
worthy
beer
o
good
beer
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
kinda
new
to
barley
wines
so
i
may
be
off
on
this
one
but
im
told
this
is
better
with
age
1
fingered
creamy
khaki
colored
head
that
displayed
decent
retention
and
eventually
settled
to
a
thin
soapy
film
atop
this
amber
colored
completely
transparent
brew
the
scent
was
pretty
boozy
hop
profile
was
fairly
strong
had
to
check
what
style
of
beer
i
was
drinking
and
make
sure
it
wasnt
an
ipa
as
the
beverage
warmed
the
scent
calmed
and
allowed
toffee
notes
and
dark
fruits
to
poke
through
the
tasting
followed
the
scent
exactly
overall
i
still
enjoyed
this
beer
but
really
think
i
will
go
out
and
grab
another
bottle
or
two
for
enjoyment
a
few
months
down
the
road
once
the
flavors
have
had
more
time
to
settle
down
and
blend
together
medium
body
with
adequate
carbonation
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
well
made
barleywine
i
cant
believe
it
took
me
this
long
to
review
it
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
have
two
more
of
these
im
going
to
cellar
o
i
cant
believe
i
only
paid
around
8
for
this
topnotch
example
of
a
very
popular
style
im
going
to
go
out
on
a
limb
here
and
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
brews
that
great
divide
makes
and
that
is
really
saying
something
d
rich
and
complex
so
many
great
things
to
say
about
this
a
near
perfect
barleywine
o
started
off
so
well
and
then
a
little
disappointed
with
the
flavor
still
a
nice
beer
but
not
tops
for
me
2011
vintage
in
a
ommegang
flute
pours
a
deep
redorange
amber
thin
persistent
very
light
tan
head
fine
and
medium
bubble
head
and
light
lacing
aroma
of
spicy
caramel
malt
dark
fruit
herbal
hops
and
a
hint
of
oxidation
piney
hops
and
sweet
malt
dominate
the
flavor
with
dark
dried
fruit
and
a
light
fruit
or
fruit
esters
component
and
light
citrus
nice
medium
mouth
feel
with
some
creaminess
the
alcohol
is
still
hot
but
the
pleasant
combination
of
flavors
keeps
this
tasty
a
prototypical
well
made
american
barley
wine
tasted
side
by
side
with
a
2009
in
a
nostradamus
flute
the
2009
has
mellowed
very
nicely
a
thicker
finer
head
with
massive
lacing
aroma
is
more
subdued
but
still
has
the
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
and
a
hint
of
hops
flavor
is
caramel
malt
dark
fruit
and
a
hint
of
citrus
nicely
integrated
flavors
have
mellowed
over
time
but
have
combined
very
nicely
body
is
incredibly
heavy
bodied
and
creamy
this
has
aged
beautifully
and
is
delicious
o
a
stellar
beer
great
fresh
or
with
some
years
on
it
this
one
even
at
the
awkward
23
year
mark
for
a
barleywine
still
delivers
mental
note
get
more
of
this
enjoy
a
few
now
and
lay
some
down
for
the
future
overall
great
hop
forward
barleywine
that
is
definitey
a
big
beer
single
finger
head
with
some
lacing
on
a
clear
amber
and
crimson
n
body
strong
malty
aroma
with
fruity
notes
flavor
has
a
strong
cinnonmon
note
up
front
also
is
spicey
malty
flavor
too
boozy
for
my
taste
though
pine
hops
seep
through
too
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
a
little
too
boozy
for
my
taste
but
otherwise
a
good
member
of
the
genre
doa
an
incredible
barleywine
among
the
tops
in
the
books
o
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
in
an
american
barleywine
from
a
good
brewery
very
tasty
stuff
have
to
grab
a
few
more
bottles
now
heavy
mouthfeel
with
a
creamy
texture
that
helps
it
go
down
so
well
overall
old
ruffian
presents
you
with
an
excellent
american
barleywine
thats
adds
a
little
boost
on
a
cold
winters
evening
would
love
to
try
this
side
by
side
with
a
fresh
one
but
alas
i
will
need
to
leave
the
state
to
find
one
this
would
likely
age
well
id
like
to
try
it
with
a
few
years
on
it
out
of
a
bottle
overall
fantastic
probably
my
favorite
barleywine
so
far
be
careful
though
at
10
20
it
is
easy
to
go
overboard
with
a
bomber
appearance
is
a
rusty
hazy
copper
color
supporting
a
thick
off
white
head
that
dissapates
slowly
leaving
a
sticky
clingy
lace
smell
of
thick
caramel
light
chocolate
and
some
darker
fruits
taste
is
as
stated
hefty
and
hoppy
having
the
big
citrus
grapefruit
thats
grainy
with
the
caramel
in
the
big
malt
backbone
mouthfeel
is
full
and
chewy
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
not
as
rich
as
some
but
then
again
it
does
express
its
hefty
and
hoppy
and
still
a
good
example
of
the
style
o
great
hearty
barleywine
that
is
poisotioned
as
full
of
caramel
flavor
and
musty
earth
aromas
great
brew
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
22
oz
cbs
snifter
pours
a
brilliant
dark
ruby
red
hue
with
a
substantial
two
finger
plus
crown
of
foam
this
is
by
far
the
most
hop
forward
nose
on
any
barleywine
ive
poured
if
id
been
blindfolded
on
this
id
have
thought
this
a
boozy
ipa
the
nose
is
riddled
with
hops
and
just
the
faintest
hint
of
malt
it
just
doesnt
have
a
nose
that
resembles
what
ive
come
to
associate
with
a
barleywine
the
first
sip
and
the
hops
jump
right
out
at
you
some
maltiness
comes
into
the
picture
immediately
after
the
hops
depart
again
theres
a
subtle
woodiness
to
this
but
its
not
a
mainstay
this
is
the
most
bizarre
example
of
a
barleywine
ive
had
at
this
point
nothing
in
either
the
nose
or
taste
points
to
this
being
a
barleywine
granted
i
dont
mind
it
at
all
and
i
find
it
enjoyable
but
the
grades
are
taking
a
bit
of
a
hit
as
im
grading
this
to
style
for
a
barleywine
and
this
thing
is
just
went
rogue
the
mouthfeel
is
boozy
with
a
high
dose
of
bitterness
again
i
personally
dont
mind
it
but
i
just
dont
expect
this
attribute
from
a
barleywine
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
if
it
wasnt
a
barleywine
i
feel
it
falls
short
of
the
style
however
and
the
experience
is
nothing
like
what
i
was
looking
forward
to
when
i
initially
cracked
the
bottle
i
can
see
myself
coming
back
to
this
the
next
time
i
want
a
bold
ipa
the
taste
is
alcoholheavy
with
little
else
to
offer
too
much
grassyness
and
no
trace
of
what
you
hope
for
in
a
barleywine
as
it
warms
a
hint
of
caramel
comes
out
but
its
too
little
too
late
the
best
thing
is
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
fullbodied
nearly
sticky
beer
carbonation
is
rich
and
the
body
is
average
of
the
style
overall
a
good
american
barleywine
o
meh
okay
certainly
a
decent
beer
to
try
im
not
that
into
barley
wines
in
general
so
its
not
really
surprising
that
im
not
hopping
all
over
this
but
its
decent
really
balance
and
doesnt
taste
bad
just
average
b
to
b
range
one
of
the
best
and
decently
priced
barleywines
out
there
with
this
and
bigfoot
around
you
have
to
wonder
how
someone
can
do
better
at
such
a
price
and
wide
availability
dethrone
rarity
if
truth
in
labeling
were
a
ba
criterion
old
ruffian
would
rate
a
1
lets
see
how
many
of
the
adjectives
describing
the
hop
content
we
can
eliminate
hefty
hopforward
overall
great
beer
o
delicious
barley
wine
and
my
first
beer
from
great
divide
would
love
to
try
this
barrelaged
o
excellent
barleywine
one
of
the
better
standard
barleywines
that
i
have
had
will
enjoy
this
again
sometime
soon
d
i
could
get
hurt
on
this
one
too
tasty
the
length
of
these
reviews
really
sucks
overall
it
hit
the
spot
and
was
exactly
what
i
expected
it
is
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
i
am
glad
i
grabbed
the
last
bottle
before
it
was
gone
d
although
hoppiness
of
this
level
is
not
unusual
for
american
barleywine
and
they
manage
it
well
i
do
feel
it
covers
up
a
lot
of
the
inherent
complexity
like
printing
shakespeare
on
toilet
paper
or
listening
to
mozart
on
an
8track
or
having
silk
bed
sheets
and
wool
pillow
cases
you
take
something
of
the
greatness
away
you
still
see
the
greatness
but
its
muffled
drinkability
is
incredible
and
poor
at
the
same
time
its
something
that
im
glad
i
shared
as
the
flavor
would
have
been
too
much
for
me
in
the
end
the
alcohol
was
hidden
quite
well
due
to
the
excess
of
malt
and
hops
after
a
year
it
still
seems
young
although
i
havent
had
it
enough
to
say
whether
its
best
fresh
or
not
o
highly
recommended
to
age
this
one
i
will
be
buying
2year
and
sitting
on
both
drink
one
after
one
year
and
let
the
other
rest
for
an
unknown
timeline
great
beer
im
now
going
to
go
search
for
this
on
tap
it
was
excellent
pours
a
slightly
hazy
honeybrown
with
a
2
inch
foamy
bone
color

that
settles
to
an
island
of
foam
random
thick
clumps
of
lace
stick
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
and
some
citrus
zest
and
pine
hops
alcohol
aromas
come
out
as
the
beer
warms
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
slight
brown
sugar
and
some
zesty
herbal
and
pine
hop
flavors
a
slightly
assertive
hop
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
barleywine
that
has
some
strong
hop
aromas
and
flavors
even
after
being
bottled
almost
a
year
ago
o
a
classic
american
bwine
hops
are
still
a
big
player
despite
the
years
and
the
malt
backbone
is
pretty
solid
booze
is
there
but
not
too
overdone
for
10
o
good
american
barley
wine
i
prefer
the
english
style
more
but
this
is
top
notch
alcohol
is
still
there
but
was
slowly
turning
into
a
big
sticky
mess
that
is
worth
having
seriously
worth
cellaring
to
get
the
faded
hop
part
ov
border
between
a
double
ipa
and
barley
wine
need
to
tone
down
the
hops
to
let
everything
play
out
a
bit
more
o
top
of
the
line
barley
wine
looks
like
it
was
bottled
april
2010
but
the
date
is
really
hard
to
read
appearance
is
nice
light
brown
ruby
color
with
a
bit
of
head
which
leaves
sparse
lacing
on
the
top
of
the
beer
and
the
side
of
the
glass
aroma
is
very
citrus
forward
with
some
caramel
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
as
it
warms
there
is
some
brown
sugar
that
emerges
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
better
very
mellow
with
caramel
some
orange
and
very
little
booziness
with
a
bit
of
the
very
well
done
mouthfeel
is
properly
heavy
and
well
carbonated
not
a
very
complex
beer
but
a
well
made
straight
forward
barleywine
very
enjoyable
beer
could
definitely
stand
up
to
some
more
aging
to
see
if
some
different
malt
characteristics
emerge
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
both
a
good
representation
and
take
on
one
of
my
favorite
styles
a
session
beer
no
way
but
with
this
beer
being
so
cheap
in
area
at
the
moment
i
might
have
to
try
overall
a
good
beer
stay
away
from
room
temperature
as
it
loses
it
flavor
im
pretty
sure
i
could
have
laid
this
down
for
another
year
or
two
with
excellent
results
id
imagine
the
hops
could
mellow
out
for
some
time
to
come
this
one
has
held
up
remarkably
well
though
i
imagine
much
of
that
has
to
do
with
doug
taking
great
care
of
the
bottle
a
treat
and
a
testament
to
the
fact
that
not
just
wales
merit
cellaring
this
beer
pours
a
nice
reddish
orange
color
slightly
hazy
with
12
fingers
of
off
white
head
produced
from
a
vigorous
pour
the
smell
is
sweet
toffee
caramel
light
hops
earth
spicey
with
a
hint
of
booze
in
the
finish
the
flavor
is
sweet
the
toffee
sweetness
comes
though
and
the
hops
are
more
faded
but
this
was
about
1
5
years
old
the
mouthfeel
is
mdium
to
full
bodied
with
god
carbonation
but
not
overly
carbed
and
its
smooth
overall
a
very
very
good
barleywine
o
this
is
a
great
barleywine
that
needs
some
time
in
the
cellar
to
become
and
exceptional
barleywine
pours
copperorange
color
with
a
huge
off
white
head
some
retention
aromas
of
sugar
sweet
malts
some
hops
and
fruits
come
through
as
it
warms
taste
is
lots
of
sugar
and
malts
typical
for
the
style
some
earthy
tones
are
noticed
but
not
much
more
going
on
than
the
sugar
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
a
decent
barley
wine
not
exactly
my
style
just
too
much
sugar
but
good
tasting
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
i
am
not
as
familiar
as
some
with
barley
wine
in
general
but
this
one
was
tasty
almost
feels
like
a
malty
dipa
its
definately
a
sipper
but
another
solid
brew
from
the
great
divide
drinkability
this
is
a
good
one
for
sharing
but
still
can
be
a
big
sipper
just
me
and
the
cat
still
awake
tonight
looks
like
bogartskiville
for
this
one
o
nice
barley
good
aroma
and
pleasant
overall
characte
great
beer
to
age
it
has
held
on
well
a
nice
brew
and
a
great
introduction
to
great
divide
a
classic
barleywine
fused
with
a
bit
of
ipa
characteristics
which
was
accessible
and
quite
enjoyable
considering
the
heat
a
bomber
was
a
bit
much
for
me
certainly
glad
i
shared
it
d
strong
bodied
beer
with
tons
of
flavor
better
at
a
touch
below
room
temp
for
sipping
aged
very
well
o
the
perfect
barleywine
not
too
bitter
not
to
sweet
chock
full
of
flavour
immense
lingering
and
delicious
i
love
great
divide
and
only
their
yeti
series
comes
close
to
rivalling
this
beer
highly
recommended
worth
seeking
out
will
be
having
again
o
delicious
im
a
fan
id
have
another
and
recommend
it
as
well
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
rich
aroma
none
of
the
components
seemed
to
outmuscle
the
other
with
the
nose
ultimately
striking
a
nice
balance
the
hops
were
there
and
unique
with
citrus
for
the
style
while
the
malts
were
equally
as
unique
with
their
sweet
caramel
characteristics
as
advertised
there
was
a
huge
bittering
aspect
of
this
beer
as
lent
by
the
aromatic
hops
while
this
did
not
act
against
the
brew
by
the
end
of
the
glass
it
became
debatably
a
bit
much
making
the
drinker
sit
back
and
really
take
his
or
her
time
overall
a
very
nice
barleywine
lacks
a
bit
of
complexity
but
its
delicious
and
well
made
d
cant
put
it
any
other
way
struggled
through
half
a
bomber
here
just
couldnt
get
over
the
harshness
of
the
flavors
both
sweet
and
hoppy
its
clear
now
im
not
going
to
like
any
barleywines
but
found
this
one
among
the
worst
ive
tried
this
i
a
good
barley
wine
it
pours
a
dark
brown
color
and
smells
of
booze
and
noble
hops
i
think
i
will
be
buying
another
bottle
of
this
for
the
cellar
because
with
a
year
or
two
on
the
bottle
it
would
a
really
great
barley
wine
but
even
fresh
it
a
great
example
of
the
style
o
overall
a
pretty
solid
offering
i
love
hop
heavy
beers
but
would
have
liked
more
of
the
sweetness
that
was
present
in
the
nose
to
come
out
in
the
taste
i
also
would
have
liked
a
more
subdued
alcohol
character
still
a
very
good
beer
though
and
worth
checking
out
bottled
on
november
20th
2010
pours
light
red
into
my
bruery
tulip
with
small
head
smells
of
pine
hops
and
alcohol
tastes
of
more
pine
bitter
hops
and
alcohol
i
also
get
some
smooth
notes
that
makes
it
go
down
easy
something
like
butter
i
know
it
sounds
weird
but
its
hard
to
explain
my
only
complaint
is
the
bitter
hops
but
its
a
barleywine
so
it
goes
along
with
the
style
i
have
had
some
barleywines
though
where
the
bitter
hops
werent
as
upfront
a
very
solid
beer
from
a
great
brewery
that
hasnt
failed
to
disappoint
me
yet
overall
a
little
too
hop
forward
it
is
really
hard
to
distinguish
any
other
flavors
besides
the
bitter
hops
burnt
flavors
and
high
alcohol
otherwise
mouthfeel
appearance
and
smell
all
fit
in
with
the
style
fairly
hard
to
finish
this
one
not
easily
drinkable
what
an
exceptionally
crafted
barleywine
bold
flavors
yet
remarkably
balanced
one
of
the
better
barleywines
with
a
wide
availability
o
delicious
barleywine
well
balanced
and
enough
alcohol
for
the
style
to
keep
it
interesting
definitely
a
sipper
10
alcohol
o
if
you
are
a
barleywine
drinker
which
i
am
not
you
will
love
this
i
found
it
to
be
a
pontetly
enjoyable
ride
to
a
style
i
rarely
visit
with
one
of
their
best
offerings
o
while
i
can
see
this
being
an
absolute
beast
fresh
with
all
the
hops
its
has
really
rounded
out
nicely
with
age
the
flavor
is
still
big
but
everything
is
mellow
out
and
completely
blended
together
and
balanced
super
smooth
rich
and
creamy
dangerously
drinkable
ill
definitely
be
looking
for
a
fresh
bottle
and
see
how
it
is
as
a
hop
monster
the
flavors
contrast
pretty
vehemently
but
everything
is
very
good
with
the
exception
of
the
strong
alcohol
aftertaste
it
really
would
have
been
nice
had
they
been
able
to
mask
that
more
but
i
like
it
this
barley
wines
for
you
springfield
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
barley
wine
considering
how
hoppy
it
is
the
10
2
is
well
covered
as
well
its
big
its
aggressive
and
as
it
warms
it
gets
sweeter
i
was
considering
cellaring
this
one
for
a
while
but
i
pulled
it
and
wasnt
upset
i
did
its
both
drinkable
and
challenging
do
drinkability
is
moderately
low
the
nose
on
this
teases
and
the
flavor
for
the
most
part
delivers
until
the
end
where
the
train
just
derails
theres
way
too
much
alcohol
in
the
finish
to
make
this
an
easydrinker
its
a
shame
because
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
actually
pretty
good
its
a
tradeoff
age
this
beer
to
mellow
the
alcohol
but
lose
the
hops
or
keep
the
hops
and
chug
nail
polish
id
take
the
former
if
i
could
do
it
again
tastes
are
caramelized
sugar
some
spice
curds
ice
cream
sprinkles
hops
oxidation
pills
bourbon
funk
grass
malt
bitterness
potatoes
and
age
smells
are
aged
amber
hops
sweet
malt
oats
wood
breakfast
cereal
paper
cigarettes
and
paint
im
off
to
buy
a
few
more
bottles
tomorrow
damn
great
beer
and
like
i
mentioned
very
wellbalanced
with
a
rich
creamy
malt
flavor
and
an
underlying
hop
presence
one
of
the
better
barleywines
i
have
tasted
o
as
i
mentioned
above
the
old
ruffian
seems
more
like
a
triple
ipa
than
a
barleywine
maybe
there
should
be
a
small
category
in
between
the
dipa
and
the
barleywine
for
beer
like
this
although
i
dont
know
what
else
would
fit
into
it
either
way
this
is
a
barleywine
for
an
ipa
fan
i
liked
it
but
i
expect
more
bold
flavor
from
the
style
pretty
good
would
like
to
try
it
fresh
as
the
hops
were
definitely
faded
great
nose
but
a
little
harsh
in
the
taste
o
its
about
what
i
expected
out
of
an
american
barleywine
the
focus
is
on
the
hops
but
the
malt
is
there
to
attempt
to
balance
it
out
thats
a
darn
good
beer
a
650ml
can
hold
you
for
the
evening
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
really
excellently
balanced
and
the
hops
presence
is
a
really
nice
addition
to
the
style
the
booze
is
noticeable
but
very
well
blended
in
for
the
level
this
is
not
a
hasty
beer
its
rich
and
rewarding
oi
didnt
like
this
as
much
as
i
had
hoped
it
is
a
good
barleywine
but
not
as
good
as
some
lesser
rated
ones
imo
this
is
too
sweet
o
if
youre
one
that
doesnt
care
for
a
more
hoppy
stye
of
barley
wine
then
this
one
is
not
for
you
for
me
however
i
love
it
its
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
wonderful
hops
and
malts
great
flavor
pricey
but
a
very
solid
barley
wine
i
would
like
to
try
their
barrel
aged
version
of
this
powerful
brew
this
one
is
a
decent
sipper
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
again
d
old
ruffian
drinks
relatively
easily
despite
its
overthetop
ibus
the
problem
is
that
it
tastes
like
just
aboutevery
other
american
barleywine
ive
drank
im
nipping
this
cellaring
experiment
in
the
bud
o
a
solid
barleywine
that
offers
a
up
a
good
dose
of
moderation
and
balance
d
overall
this
is
a
great
barleywine
glad
my
local
pub
has
this
on
tap
everyday
will
get
this
beer
again
and
again
lots
of
flavor
and
refreshing
this
beer
pours
a
ruby
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
off
white
head
with
a
bit
of
lacing
and
some
decent
retention
the
aroma
is
strong
with
caramel
and
cherry
notes
the
taste
starts
malty
then
becomes
sweet
with
caramel
and
fig
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
balanced
but
finishes
slightly
bitter
overall
a
decent
barleywine
t
this
is
definitely
a
good
representation
of
the
style
not
my
favorite
barleywine
out
there
but
its
definitely
a
good
one
i
got
a
lot
of
caramel
malt
with
some
nice
pine
hop
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
biscuit
on
the
finish
pours
a
hazy
amberorange
color
with
a
finger
of
quickly
fading
cream
colored
head
good
retention
of
lacing
aroma
is
of
hops
caramel
raisins
bread
caramel
very
sweet
smelling
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
smell
with
a
bit
of
citrusy
hops
and
slightly
bitter
sticky
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
this
is
my
1
barleywine
style
ale
i
love
it
this
beer
ages
very
very
well
a
two
or
three
year
old
bottle
is
fantastice
all
of
the
flavors
become
incredibly
bold
tried
again
in
january
2012
2009
bottle
slightly
bitter
and
dry
aftertaste
i
love
barleywines
but
this
is
lacking
a
wow
factor
for
me
overall
a
solid
barleywine
a
year
old
seems
to
be
a
good
age
for
this
brew
o
pretty
drinkable
but
certainly
glad
i
was
able
to
split
this
with
a
couple
of
buddies
i
would
pick
this
up
again
without
a
doubt
notes
good
us
barley
wine
nothing
i
would
crave
for
im
sensing
that
without
some
age
cask
serving
andor
some
barrel
aging
i
might
not
be
too
big
a
fan
of
the
style
but
a
nice
quality
brew
in
any
case
overall
one
of
the
best
barley
wines
that
ive
ever
had
the
privileged
of
tasting
d
pretty
drinkable
at
first
but
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
really
wear
on
you
after
a
while
very
good
but
a
bomber
is
plenty
the
07
and
08
had
slight
raisiny
notes
as
well
exceptionally
drinkable
apart
from
the
10
which
obviously
still
needed
some
time
to
get
itself
together
really
exciting
to
sip
on
this
vertical
overall
a
wonderful
barleywine
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
drinkable
extremely
flavourful
and
classy
drinkability
a
good
barlywine
however
a
bit
harsher
than
expected
warming
of
the
throat
and
alcohol
in
the
taste
surprised
me
seeing
as
this
is
over
a
year
old
already
from
the
bottling
date
good
but
there
are
other
barlywines
id
rather
have
definitively
good
american
barley
wine
style
but
for
me
lets
kick
it
into
a
higher
gear
thanks
warbird07
for
this
one
bottled
in
2008
poured
into
snifter
appearance
is
a
murky
amberruby
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
head
with
residual
lacing
smells
of
raisins
candied
fruits
caramel
with
a
touch
of
heat
warming
the
nostrils
just
like
a
good
barleywine
should
smell
like
the
taste
accompanies
the
smell
quite
nicely
nice
sweet
candied
fruits
caramel
with
a
hop
bitterness
at
the
endsurprising
for
three
years
of
age
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
full
body
moderate
carbonation
it
does
finish
a
touch
dry
drinkablility
is
pretty
good
there
is
a
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
but
it
didnt
preclude
me
from
finishing
the
bomber
o
i
cant
honestly
say
i
was
longing
for
my
next
sip
ill
have
to
revisit
in
the
future
to
see
if
i
may
have
missed
something
or
my
palate
was
off
d
wish
i
had
more
d
mediocre
drinkability
like
all
other
barley
wines
overall
im
still
not
quite
enamored
by
barleywines
and
this
was
good
but
im
not
sure
if
i
will
be
getting
this
again
i
might
need
to
get
this
a
bit
fresher
when
the
hops
are
more
pronounced
going
by
other
reviews
certainly
worth
a
try
though
based
on
reputation
alone
at
least
cheers
i
like
this
one
not
sure
if
its
going
to
be
an
a
beer
but
its
an
a
at
the
worst
she
is
going
down
fast
and
easy
nice
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
this
all
night
but
it
is
very
flavorful
and
smooth
with
a
nice
complexity
that
is
quite
enjoyable
d
not
a
bad
barleywine
i
think
the
balance
was
off
a
little
but
not
enough
to
make
a
major
impact
solid
beer
but
im
not
sure
if
i
would
pick
this
up
again
overall
as
far
as
american
barleywines
go
this
one
is
one
of
the
top
examples
despite
having
fairly
detectable
hoppy
notes
the
malt
is
still
the
main
player
here
although
it
is
not
overly
sweet
it
is
just
a
damn
tasty
beer
that
you
should
definitely
try
full
bodied
moderate
carbonation
hoppy
and
oily
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
is
too
hoppy
for
a
barleywine
bottle
beautiful
dark
mahogany
pour
with
a
long
lasting
layer
of
offwhite
foam
aroma
is
quite
hoppy
pine
with
strong
burnt
caramel
notes
some
fruity
notes
too
taste
is
super
bitter
lots
of
hop
bite
alcohol
and
caramel
palate
is
full
bodied
thick
texture
with
long
warm
finish
well
done
sipper
i
drank
half
the
bottle
and
wanted
more
very
drinkable
now
with
age
but
young
could
pose
luppilin
threshold
im
going
to
pick
up
some
more
dusty
bottles
for
aging
d
too
big
for
me
to
drink
a
lot
of
really
a
wonderful
beer
but
its
a
normal
beer
turned
to
11
i
can
only
deal
with
so
much
of
that
volume
before
i
need
a
break
scores
in
the
review
are
averages
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
some
months
now
and
had
planned
to
buy
a
case
of
it
if
i
could
in
my
area
it
had
to
be
special
ordered
and
was
90
for
12
of
these
bad
boys
a
little
much
for
a
case
in
my
book
so
i
opted
out
but
ill
definitely
be
picking
singles
up
whenever
i
can
find
them
can
see
why
this
is
highly
rated
overall
good
slow
drinking
beer
nothing
super
exciting
taking
place
in
this
beer
d
for
a
big
barley
wine
this
is
exceptionally
drinkable
you
can
toss
this
back
but
you
dont
want
to
since
its
so
damn
good
the
beer
develops
more
with
each
sip
and
the
ride
it
takes
you
on
kicks
ass
md
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
i
liked
the
flavor
profile
it
is
very
complex
especially
for
a
barleywine
my
problem
was
how
present
the
alcohol
was
it
was
a
struggle
to
drink
this
one
i
look
forward
to
having
one
with
some
age
on
it
pours
a
dark
copper
w
a
nice
1
finger
caramel
head
the
head
sticks
around
a
bit
then
goes
down
to
a
sliver
i
can
smell
this
beer
without
even
lifting
the
glass
to
my
nose
it
smells
of
caramel
fruit
some
pine
and
malt
wow
if
the
taste
lives
up
to
the
smell
this
is
going
to
be
fantastic
the
taste
is
even
better
than
the
smell
wow
this
is
a
fantastic
example
of
a
barley
wine
ale
in
fact
i
can
tell
after
one
taste
its
the
best
ive
had
the
taste
is
perfect
thus
the
rare
5
everything
works
really
well
together
the
malt
being
the
backdrop
that
holds
it
all
together
mouthfeel
is
great
hops
come
through
here
but
its
all
very
balanced
and
goes
down
easy
drinkability
is
really
good
as
well
at
10
2
the
bomber
is
probably
all
ill
want
but
it
goes
down
easily
all
in
all
a
fantastic
beer
and
one
ill
definitely
pick
up
and
enjoy
again
i
cant
believe
how
long
its
taken
me
to
try
this
one
old
ruffian
pours
a
thick
creamy
head
on
top
of
a
dark
ruby
body
im
smelling
something
fruity
here
maybe
grapes
or
grape
juice
im
not
noticing
any
hops
to
the
taste
just
sweet
malty
goodness
backed
up
by
a
warm
boozy
aftertaste
im
a
big
fan
of
hoppy
beers
but
every
now
and
then
i
do
enjoy
strong
malty
barleywines
this
is
dangerously
good
gotta
love
great
divide
810
heavy
in
body
and
certainly
a
sipping
beer
its
the
kind
of
beer
that
a
bomber
in
a
night
would
be
enough
that
said
im
a
happy
man
with
this
brew
this
brew
was
complex
wellbalanced
and
very
drinkable
for
the
style
havent
tried
an
aged
version
but
i
look
forward
to
buying
several
more
for
both
the
fridge
and
the
cellar
overall
a
pretty
good
barley
wine
that
aged
nicely
d
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
barlywine
style
i
must
go
out
and
get
more
to
age
d
because
of
the
alcohol
content
gets
over
on
you
very
quickly
be
prepared
very
prepared
you
dont
want
more
than
two
of
these
in
any
one
sitting
pair
it
with
breads
to
absorb
some
of
the
alcohol
im
completely
fed
up
be
warned
poured
a
auburn
brown
body
with
decent
head
retention
and
lace
ring
on
top
of
a
thick
malty
aroma
bready
dry
roasted
sweet
caramel
all
in
there
hints
of
herbal
hop
bitterness
as
well
a
filling
heavy
body
that
is
balanced
as
i
pick
up
a
bready
dry
malt
base
along
with
some
caramel
sweetness
and
there
is
also
a
decent
patch
of
herbal
hop
bitterness
minor
sweet
fruit
flavors
and
a
crisp
finish
thanks
to
a
barely
poking
out
abv
a
dangerous
sipper
as
it
is
strong
and
boozy
but
real
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
this
brewery
never
stops
to
leave
me
impressed
like
many
others
it
just
surprises
me
with
every
concoction
they
come
up
with
i
enjoy
this
beer
i
really
do
at
the
end
of
the
day
a
12
oz
bottle
would
be
best
i
think
or
somebody
to
share
with
about
16
oz
through
the
bottle
and
its
just
getting
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
its
been
there
for
a
few
ounces
actually
this
is
a
fine
example
of
an
american
barleywine
that
should
be
tried
overall
incredible
d
complex
and
fun
big
beer
high
abv
might
be
hard
to
come
by
cheers
i
like
this
one
another
great
effort
by
great
divide
they
can
do
no
wrong
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
making
this
quite
a
drinkable
barleywine
medium
bodied
bordering
on
syrupy
if
not
for
faint
carbonation
trying
its
hardest
to
lighten
things
up
alcohol
isnt
present
on
the
tongue
but
the
warmth
in
your
throat
reminds
you
that
youre
drinking
a
very
big
beer
d
this
much
alcohol
should
not
be
so
drinkable
exceptionally
smooth
sipper
the
flavor
masks
the
booze
so
well
this
bottle
was
2010
vintage
this
beer
poured
a
burnt
amber
in
color
with
a
one
finger
soapy
looking
off
white
head
the
aromas
were
off
there
were
some
dark
fruits
and
a
whole
lot
of
malt
i
think
that
this
was
possibly
consumed
a
little
too
fresh
and
needed
time
to
figure
itself
out
the
flavors
too
were
a
mess
it
was
far
too
sweet
and
had
a
lot
of
molasses
and
candied
sugars
going
on
the
hops
were
still
present
but
there
was
an
onslaught
of
malt
this
didnt
really
relate
to
any
american
barleywines
ive
enjoyed
in
the
past
it
wasnt
very
good
at
all
and
left
behind
a
bitter
aftertaste
like
all
of
great
divides
beers
it
had
the
dry
and
sudsy
mouthfeel
feeling
like
you
had
coated
the
inside
of
your
mouth
with
soap
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
least
enjoyable
barleywines
ive
tired
id
be
willing
to
give
an
older
bottle
a
try
but
this
10
was
just
not
my
kind
of
barleywine
big
beer
very
big
but
oh
so
good
one
in
a
sitting
is
just
fine
ill
certainly
be
getting
this
one
again
this
barley
wine
has
a
nice
clean
finish
that
makes
it
very
drinkable
the
aroma
was
very
fresh
making
it
quite
enticing
the
color
of
old
ruffian
was
cloudy
and
light
reddishbrown
but
wasnt
thick
in
mouthfeel
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
product
and
cannot
wait
to
try
more
beer
in
the
great
divide
family
d
i
think
this
is
a
little
too
hoppy
for
my
liking
not
bad
flavor
wise
but
there
is
just
something
missing
from
this
one
bottle
poured
into
a
tasting
glass
an
amber
orange
color
with
a
slight
tan
head
swirling
creates
a
nice
little
head
and
allows
the
aromas
to
waft
a
little
more
both
citrus
and
pine
emanate
from
this
brew
along
with
some
sweet
smelling
notes
this
to
me
is
a
very
hop
forward
bw
and
the
citrus
and
pine
notes
jump
upfront
followed
by
a
transition
to
a
malty
backbone
medium
mouthfeel
finishes
with
a
lingering
bitterness
as
it
warms
i
get
some
medical
type
notes
in
the
flavor
deep
red
and
clear
light
carbonation
fluffy
khaki
colored
head
with
good
retention
aroma
of
apples
and
some
licorice
starts
off
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
tingle
the
middle
to
end
is
truly
interesting
it
starts
with
a
brief
malty
molasseslike
sweetness
this
is
followed
by
a
slow
and
long
hop
punch
with
bittersweet
molasses
counter
punches
the
licorice
shows
up
again
in
the
finish
this
is
all
followed
by
a
warming
alcohol
sensation
after
the
finish
loving
the
barley
wine
style
will
certainly
seek
this
ale
out
again
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
with
a
creamy
amount
of
carbonation
a
fantastic
barleywine
great
fresh
and
should
be
just
as
good
if
not
better
with
some
age
ill
definitely
be
drinking
more
as
well
as
aging
a
few
bottles
all
in
all
this
was
one
good
barleywine
great
divide
keeps
on
impressing
with
their
brews
definitely
worth
trying
especially
if
you
like
barleywines
d
damn
that
was
good
im
glad
i
can
now
go
down
to
any
decent
beer
store
and
buy
this
served
from
tap
into
an
imperial
pint
poured
redorange
with
a
one
finger
bone
white
head
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
sweet
hops
caramel
dark
fruit
alcohol
and
slight
bitter
hops
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
quite
the
excellent
barleywine
had
a
great
robust
flavor
with
enough
sweetness
to
hide
the
alcohol
well
nice
aroma
going
on
here
too
to
be
honest
there
really
isnt
very
much
missing
on
this
one
this
is
an
absolute
must
try
if
you
have
not
already
glad
i
have
a
ba
version
on
its
way
in
a
trade
here
in
the
near
future
so
i
can
compare
d
as
far
as
barleywines
go
im
not
sure
you
want
one
with
easy
drinkability
so
i
give
this
a
pretty
good
rating
considering
that
im
only
going
to
have
1
at
a
time
it
does
go
down
fairly
smooth
but
is
way
to
rich
and
strong
for
multiple
servings
in
one
sitting
the
cpj
d
the
citrus
hop
character
reduces
the
drinkability
d
for
a
10
barleywine
i
cant
detect
any
alcohol
presence
a
delicious
beer
that
should
be
sipped
and
savored
it
was
definitely
a
well
balanced
and
drinkable
barley
wine
the
heavy
body
and
alcohol
content
still
make
it
a
nice
lasting
sipper
holding
this
for
a
while
is
good
because
this
beer
keeps
rewarding
you
as
it
warms
ill
end
this
by
saying
i
am
not
a
big
barleywine
fan
but
i
was
definitely
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
it
was
too
strong
for
me
and
the
flavors
didnt
suit
my
palate
this
beer
is
about
a
year
old
and
its
obvious
the
punchy
hops
promised
by
the
bottle
have
diminished
greatly
good
having
had
a
fresh
old
crustacean
and
being
really
quite
put
off
by
the
scorching
hop
bitterness
i
think
about
a
year
is
the
perfect
time
to
drink
beers
like
this
this
is
just
rich
complex
and
sweet
like
a
really
great
dessert
wine
good
taste
good
drinkin
in
my
book
cheers
d
a
big
abv
makes
this
a
nice
sipper
a
really
nice
barley
wine
that
you
should
seek
out
i
know
i
will
for
sure
pretty
darn
nice
bw
nice
fullbodied
mouthfeel
with
adequate
carbonation
dangerously
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
while
i
prefer
the
english
counterpart
of
the
style
this
is
great
rendition
of
the
american
version
magnificent
beer
notes
a
little
more
balanced
overall
than
fresh
batch
not
sure
if
its
just
attributed
to
age
or
if
the
recipe
changes
slightly
a
cuvee
of
both
is
outstanding
d
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
too
much
going
on
to
be
able
to
down
this
easily
quite
a
bit
less
hoppy
than
bigfoot
but
thats
good
because
it
cuts
way
down
on
the
astringency
i
love
old
ruffian
and
its
not
hard
to
see
why
as
i
work
my
way
through
the
bottle
this
is
my
favorite
barleywine
and
the
standard
upon
which
i
judge
all
other
barleywines
that
i
consume
d
this
is
absolutely
a
big
beer
in
gdbcs
nature
although
this
beer
is
decent
and
i
imagine
fantastic
with
two
years
under
its
belt
i
cannot
call
it
great
worth
a
try
worth
a
purchase
to
age
a
couple
beyond
that
mediocre
as
far
as
bws
go
verdict
old
ruffian
is
a
terrific
example
of
the
american
barleywine
style
its
tasty
complex
and
criminally
drinkable
this
is
such
great
beer
when
fresh
that
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
ages
clear
ruby
amber
color
thick
offwhite
head
smells
of
yeast
pear
and
floral
hops
sweet
malty
taste
along
with
tart
fruit
like
cherry
apple
cider
with
spice
a
little
hop
bitterness
at
the
back
medium
to
fuller
bodied
a
little
oily
really
nice
drink
overall
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
with
a
well
hidden
abv
nice
balance
between
hops
and
malts
as
well
as
palate
that
allows
you
to
have
more
than
one
cheers
another
fine
example
of
why
i
love
great
divide
brewing
co
solid
american
barleywine
drinkabilitywell
its
a
barleywine
so
drinkability
is
hard
for
me
to
rate
but
it
certainly
leaves
me
satisfied
and
looking
forward
to
successive
sips
with
each
drink
for
style
its
pretty
much
perfect
cheers
i
expected
old
ruffian
to
be
good
i
didnt
expect
it
to
be
this
good
considering
that
i
am
not
as
keen
of
americanstyle
barleywines
simply
a
magnificent
beer
to
sip
on
throughout
the
night
and
a
slice
of
caramel
cheesecake
that
the
label
recommends
as
a
food
pairing
sounds
dank
old
ruffian
is
a
wonderfully
aggressive
flavorful
ruby
gem
too
strong
for
everyday
yet
delicious
and
bitter
enough
to
make
any
day
special
easy
to
drink
actually
too
easy
to
drink
i
prefer
my
barleywines
a
bit
more
syrupy
but
thats
me
one
thing
is
for
sure
there
is
no
sign
of
this
being
above
10
abv
glad
i
picked
this
up
edit
just
had
to
edit
my
review
there
is
a
ton
of
toffee
that
comes
through
as
this
beer
warms
up
a
bit
which
is
great
old
ruffian
lacks
the
bite
and
burn
i
would
normally
associate
with
the
style
very
hoppy
and
very
drinkable
in
exchange
and
i
like
that
trade
drinkability
sipper
a
nice
hoppy
barleywine
this
is
my
second
time
having
this
brew
warm
in
the
gut
its
a
nice
brew
for
a
snowy
day
outside
2009
vintage
bottled
on
december
2
so
just
over
a
year
of
aging
on
this
one
the
ruffian
pours
a
rusty
red
color
with
a
fizzy
and
bubbly
head
aroma
has
this
raisin
and
fruit
thing
going
on
with
a
subtle
malt
sweetness
in
the
background
taste
is
huge
the
label
says
hefty
and
it
might
actually
be
appropriate
in
this
case
the
first
sips
let
you
know
that
theres
a
big
hop
profile
on
this
one
with
a
lingering
bitterness
that
i
associate
more
with
ipas
than
the
barleywine
style
this
has
to
be
dryhopped
im
amazed
that
a
beer
this
old
can
have
this
much
hop
presence
impressive
beyond
the
hops
is
this
great
carameltoffee
malt
backbone
that
holds
everything
up
as
the
beer
warms
and
opens
up
theres
this
very
nice
raisin
and
fruitcake
sweetness
that
comes
out
the
more
you
drink
it
theres
some
alcohol
burn
on
the
way
down
though
its
not
unpleasant
and
certainly
something
you
kind
of
expect
with
the
style
overall
this
is
a
hefty
and
hoppy
borrowing
from
the
label
example
of
the
american
barleywine
style
have
to
take
off
points
for
drinkability
because
of
he
acidity
ill
rereview
my
other
bottle
in
612
months
and
see
if
its
gone
away
old
ruffian
wasnt
the
best
barleywine
at
the
tasting
but
it
certainly
wasnt
the
worst
in
my
experience
age
does
wonders
for
this
brew
and
three
years
seems
to
be
its
peak
this
guy
is
not
that
drinkable
and
definitely
a
sipper
i
couldnt
imagine
having
a
second
one
of
these
not
that
it
was
designed
for
that
goal
like
most
american
barleywines
this
one
is
thick
meaty
and
full
of
flavor
dfairly
good
drinkability
here
despite
the
abv
d
a
great
barleywine
lots
of
great
caramel
malts
and
dark
fruits
in
the
smell
and
taste
and
a
nice
feel
for
over
10
abv
would
love
to
have
again
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
an
off
white
soapy
head
it
has
an
aroma
of
citrus
pine
and
tons
of
caramel
sweet
caramel
taste
with
some
citrus
notes
on
the
bitter
pine
finish
a
very
tasty
barleywine
i
love
the
mix
of
hops
in
this
brew
may
consider
aging
one
d
its
a
big
bad
beer
in
terms
of
flavor
but
the
10
5
abv
is
hard
to
pin
down
one
of
those
that
doesnt
hit
you
until
you
stand
up
supremely
drinkable
i
want
one
for
dessert
22oz
bottle
served
in
my
darkness
tulip
pours
the
color
and
clarity
of
unpasteurized
cider
perhaps
a
little
darker
with
a
quarter
inch
loose
offwhite
cap
embedded
with
tiny
ringlets
head
eventually
disperses
towards
the
edges
leaving
a
broken
slick
and
a
thin
band
around
the
bowl
some
delicate
spots
and
strands
of
lacing
were
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
expresses
toffee
dark
fruit
a
hint
of
cocoa
and
a
suggestion
of
booze
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
a
hops
presence
cuts
through
the
malty
sweetness
and
lightly
lingers
between
quaffs
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
slightly
oilyviscous
quality
across
the
tongue
definitely
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
american
barleywines
ive
tried
hops
presence
is
not
too
overwhelming
and
nicely
cuts
the
malty
sweetness
also
the
alcohol
is
incrediblly
wellhidden
delicious
and
dangerously
drinkable
do
whoa
what
a
big
beer
loved
every
minute
of
it
and
believe
me
i
savored
it
for
a
long
time
thank
you
gd
overall
excellent
beer
overall
old
ruffian
is
a
very
good
barleywine
that
id
highly
recommend
especially
if
you
are
a
hop
lover
d
hmmm
i
didnt
really
taste
any
of
the
subtle
fruit
aromas
the
label
mentions
but
it
was
a
darn
good
barleywine
good
warmth
nice
caramel
sweetness
followed
the
strong
bitter
hops
and
long
finish
balance
leans
towards
hops
for
sure
the
caramel
and
bitter
citrus
hoppiness
worked
for
me
but
i
tend
to
prefer
a
slightly
fruiter
barleywine
i
would
drink
this
again
though
d
a
very
nice
american
barleywine
that
possibly
could
benefit
from
a
couple
of
years
in
my
beercellar
otherwise
a
nice
product
let
the
halloween
minitasting
begin
this
offering
pours
a
seemingly
cloudy
amberbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
light
tan
froth
the
nose
comprises
biscuits
orange
peel
rye
bread
milk
chocolate
toffee
and
a
light
bunch
o
flowers
the
taste
pummels
the
tongue
with
a
strong
citrushopbased
bitterness
with
leather
figs
rubber
light
cocoa
tobacco
spinach
stems
and
a
vodkalike
character
all
aiding
and
abetting
in
this
assault
its
all
a
bit
much
frankly
the
body
is
pretty
hefty
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
fairly
chewy
feel
overall
this
is
a
beast
that
must
be
sipped
carefully
lest
the
fury
truly
be
unleashed
again
i
feel
everything
is
a
bit
overdone
making
the
experience
a
bit
less
than
really
enjoyable
this
beer
pours
a
murky
reddish
brown
with
a
decent
beige
head
that
fades
to
lace
on
the
surface
this
beer
smells
of
brandy
bourbon
clove
cherry
and
candied
oranges
the
flavor
is
of
a
cheaper
whiskey
there
is
malty
gingery
peppery
flavor
that
is
rather
on
the
low
key
side
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
destructive
on
the
tongue
the
astringent
nature
of
this
beer
is
a
little
offputting
but
its
still
smooth
as
far
as
the
viscosity
is
concerned
its
a
fairly
good
drinking
beer
but
not
the
top
of
my
list
of
beers
id
seek
out
too
often
edit
as
it
warms
even
more
theres
a
lot
more
of
the
nuttiness
character
as
well
as
a
hint
of
dark
belgian
chocolate
overall
i
can
recognize
the
complexity
and
depth
of
flavor
in
this
beer
but
it
forces
its
potent
flavors
too
strongly
and
becomes
a
bit
brash
for
my
liking
in
this
way
i
equate
this
beer
to
an
acquaintance
who
joins
your
group
of
friends
while
they
engage
in
a
round
of
friendly
trash
talking
and
is
a
bit
too
good
at
the
putdowns
hes
funny
and
his
barbs
are
certainly
meant
to
be
goodnatured
but
you
still
just
dont
appreciate
him
calling
your
sister
a
lowclass
call
girl
who
wouldnt
be
considered
interesting
enough
to
appear
on
the
jerry
springer
show
even
if
her
boyfriend
left
her
for
a
bearded
dwarf
with
tourette
syndrome
d
holy
crap
this
is
a
great
beer
but
on
the
drinkability
scale
not
so
much
its
meant
to
be
sipped
on
a
cool
day
better
yet
freezing
winter
day
and
enjoyed
very
slowly
letting
it
change
as
it
warms
up
the
flavors
are
rich
and
this
beer
is
just
about
as
big
as
they
can
come
drink
ive
only
had
6
barleywines
but
this
has
to
reach
the
top
of
the
pile
this
was
a
good
beer
bordering
on
great
the
palate
opens
with
a
solid
blast
of
caramel
and
candy
with
brown
sugar
and
a
rather
intense
tobacco
character
as
it
warms
up
the
tobacco
really
grows
tempering
how
fast
you
can
drink
this
fruity
oxidation
is
present
blending
very
well
with
the
leather
tobacco
and
the
caramel
character
the
hop
flavor
has
mostly
faded
but
a
rather
potent
bitterness
is
present
a
blend
of
hops
and
grain
with
a
little
burnt
sugar
thrown
in
for
good
measure
the
finish
is
excellently
balanced
with
sweetness
and
bitterness
present
in
appropriate
amounts
and
the
tobacco
adding
complexity
great
flavors
and
balance
here
this
beer
is
full
in
body
and
has
soft
carbonation
and
a
great
finish
an
excellent
barleywine
one
im
going
to
enjoy
sipping
over
the
course
of
the
evening
in
some
ways
it
reminds
me
of
the
kuhnhenn
fourth
dementia
a
beer
i
need
to
revisit
i
would
also
add
that
i
like
this
more
than
the
ba
version
drinkability
for
how
much
flavor
alcohol
and
bitterness
this
contains
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
d
this
one
has
a
crazy
amount
of
flavor
and
yet
is
extremely
drinkable
deliciously
sweet
and
bold
flavors
with
the
most
lace
ive
seen
left
by
any
beer
makes
this
a
winner
in
my
book
not
very
drinkable
this
actually
got
me
a
little
messed
up
heavy
borderline
cloying
stickiness
and
has
a
burnt
fruit
taste
in
the
background
after
every
sip
for
that
reason
drinkability
is
low
for
me
although
if
this
is
your
thing
its
a
truly
smooth
brew
for
the
abv
and
the
category
as
for
me
and
great
divide
i
think
ill
stick
to
my
yeti
d
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
someone
else
drank
through
my
snifter
fairly
fast
and
went
for
another
pour
can
barely
taste
the
10
abv
in
it
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
mediumbodied
and
smooth
with
low
bubbly
activity
now
i
can
really
see
why
barleywines
are
prime
candidates
for
cellaring
and
aging
the
flavors
considerably
evolve
given
the
time
its
allowed
for
and
make
way
for
some
new
taste
experiences
if
you
want
to
be
accustomed
to
barleywines
old
ruffian
will
give
you
a
nice
introduction
drinkability
is
really
quite
good
thanks
to
the
complexity
of
the
taste
and
the
great
mouthfeel
my
first
barleywine
and
i
think
i
rolled
a
good
one
since
it
was
so
malty
and
sweet
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
up
another
one
of
these
and
putting
some
age
on
it
another
excellent
brew
from
great
divide
poured
brown
with
ruby
highlights
that
had
a
nice
finger
of
head
and
did
left
some
bubblt
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
was
quite
hoppy
with
malts
and
caramel
notes
popping
up
alongside
apple
slight
citrus
and
pine
notes
as
well
well
this
barelywine
is
really
hoppy
but
rich
in
flavor
from
the
caramel
but
it
did
have
slight
apple
citrus
pine
grassy
boozy
and
sweet
malts
accents
the
brew
was
medium
to
full
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
hoppy
slight
boozy
and
rich
finish
it
drank
pretty
good
considering
the
abv
and
hop
punch
but
this
type
of
character
in
a
barelywine
doesnt
really
tickle
my
pickle
great
barleywine
which
deserves
to
be
be
aged

pours
golden

a

a
very
harmonious
balance
toffee
and
caramel
flavors
with
a
bombardment
of

while
most
hoppy
barleywines
will
just
load
up
on

and
create
a

sweet

experience
ruffian
opts
for
an
extremely
bitter
resinous

which
actually
works
to
temper
the
richness
i
quite
like
this
take
on
the
style
hefty
but
balanced
drinkability
world
class
bw
drinkability
is
about
average
the
high
abv
and
muddled
bitternesswood
flavors
made
this
a
somewhat
harsh
sipper
maybe
more
time
will
help
this
out
or
maybe
my
bottle
was
somewhat
oxidized
if
this
is
how
old
ruffian
is
supposed
to
taste
then
i
would
take
a
bigfoot
over
this
any
day
overall
drink
this
brew
fresh
its
fantastic
with
some
age
the
hops
mellow
and
this
brew
starts
drinking
more
like
an
english
barley
wine
which
i
do
not
prefer
drinkability
tasty
stuff
but
way
too
hoppy
for
me
taste
still
has
a
massive
bitterness
with
a
thinnedout
malt
backing
tons
of
alcohol
heat
and
some
raisiny
fruitiness
carbonation
is
low
and
fits
an
aged
barleywine
well
malts
are
smooth
going
down
but
the
biting
bitterness
and
heavy
alcohol
make
this
a
slow
sipper
i
think
this
is
actually
better
when
fresh
or
is
in
an
awkward
middle
phase
of
aging
hard
to
tell
which
needs
some
hop
flavor
in
the
middle
palate
and
some
varying
malts
throughout
i
will
be
getting
a
fresh
version
of
this
and
give
it
a
rereview
at
some
point
this
is
as
drinkable
as
a
barleywine
could
be
i
like
it
a
very
intense
barleywine
but
very
nice
definitely
a
hop
heads
barleywine
this
beer
smells
heavenly
i
wish
i
could
make
it
into
a
candle
this
a
hop
forward
barley
wine
the
malt
almost
seems
to
get
lost
in
the
dominance
of
hops
still
a
fantastic
and
very
complex
beer
was
told
this
bottle
is
from
either
2006
or
2007
pours
a
mahogany
colour
with
offwhite
head
lots
of
caramel
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
still
has
some
bitterness
in
the
flavour
but
quite
sweet
aging
seems
to
have
done
this
beer
well
classic
barleywine
d
easy
to
drink
although
the
abv
and
heaviness
made
it
a
little
tougher
to
get
through
the
bottle
a
very
great
example
of
an
american
barleywine
though
d
sweet
malty
tasty
delicious
i
could
drink
it
all
night
but
then
i
would
pass
out
from
the
abv
anyway
enjoy
this
one
because
its
a
great
barley
wine
tasted
of
dried
fruit
quite
bready
and
full
bodied
lingering
and
powerful
bitterness
that
balances
well
and
masks
the
high
level
of
alcohol
pretty
good
im
not
crazy
about
barley
wines
that
come
across
as
syrupy
and
this
one
doesnt
fairly
complex
and
well
balanced
we
couldnt
believe
it
was
a
purported
8590
ibus
drinkability
the
drinkability
is
moderate
despite
this
being
an
extremely
wellcrafted
beer
the
abv
and
weight
are
simply
too
much
for
too
much
but
still
worth
sipping
and
would
probably
be
more
ideal
for
the
cooler
months
pours
a
clear
amber
copper
with
a
cream
white
head
smells
of
a
typical
hoppy
malty
barley
wine
similar
to
gnarley
wine
in
aroma
mildheavy
hop
flavors
a
little
bit
of
citrus
and
something
else
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
im
thinking
orange
but
what
not
much
a
noticeable
malt
flavor
not
in
comparison
to
the
hops
kinda
tastes
like
hoppy
orange
peels
theres
a
tobacco
flavor
mixed
in
there
too
definitely
a
few
flavors
ive
tasted
before
but
not
combined
like
this
the
body
is
mediumthin
kinda
throws
me
off
a
little
theres
not
enough
carbonation
to
make
up
for
it
i
think
they
were
using
a
california
mindset
for
this
beer
but
made
an
attempt
at
originality
so
it
wouldnt
be
copycat
brew
id
maybe
drink
this
again
definitely
not
bad
just
my
loyalties
lie
elsewhere
very
smooth
and
drinkable
for
a
strong
barley
wine
very
savory
with
a
pleasant
aftertaste
the
balance
in
the
hops
and
the
heavier
malt
and
dark
fruit
flavors
really
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
mouthfeel
was
certainly
full
without
being
cloying
plenty
of
rich
carbonation
helped
with
this
for
such
a
big
rich
beer
this
was
so
easy
to
drink
this
is
not
a
crazy
extreme
barleywine
as
some
make
these
days
and
it
benefits
from
that
just
a
perfectly
executedstraight
forward
barleywine
great
beer
awesome
barleywine
love
this
one
d
flavorful
and
complex
much
more
drinkable
than
other
barleywines
a
nice
alternative
to
some
of
the
more
angry
hoppy
interpretations
of
the
style
that
shred
your
pallate
with
an
overload
of
hops
im
curious
to
see
what
this
tastes
like
after
a
year
or
so
of
aging
d
a
little
sweet
and
boozy
to
be
very
drinkable
great
barleywine
but
its
tough
to
call
this
one
drinkable
a
sipper
also
would
love
to
try
this
as
fresh
as
possible
to
see
what
hop
character
is
initially
here
d
well
its
a
heavy
and
really
sweet
so
its
one
at
the
time
but
it
is
better
than
most
barleywine
d
this
was
a
very
bold
and
complex
beer
with
great
scent
and
taste
and
body
it
was
a
little
hot
so
it
was
easier
to
sip
fresh
but
it
will
probably
mellow
out
and
improve
significantly
with
age
making
a
great
beer
even
better
d
overall
a
great
barley
wine
definitely
a
sipper
but
if
you
are
a
fan
of
barley
wines
you
must
try
this
beer
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
orangy
amber
brown
with
small
amounts
of
constant
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
thin
1
finger
milky
white
had
that
clung
very
well
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
with
a
hoppy
aroma
slightly
tart
a
bit
of
mediterranean
spicy
sweet
taste
was
slightly
sweet
slightly
hoppy
with
a
touch
of
tart
citrus
coated
very
well
clung
just
right
nicely
carbonated
easy
to
drink
but
the
abv
hit
hard
and
fast
this
seems
to
have
gained
a
reputation
as
the
benchmark
for
nationally
available
american
barleywines
over
the
last
several
years
and
theres
really
no
question
why
the
fresh
hops
here
were
just
explosive
yet
this
still
remained
balanced
and
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
i
definitely
sensed
a
little
more
complexity
to
the
malts
and
im
interested
in
checking
this
out
in
a
few
years
from
now
when
those
hops
subside
and
some
new
flavors
emerge
this
was
some
great
stuff
and
a
goto
in
the
style
for
me
worth
a
try
overall
a
well
brewed
barley
that
really
stands
out
in
the
crowd
well
balanced
noncloying
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bitterness
and
extremely
enjoyable
worth
checking
out
pours
a
deep
rich
amber
color
with
a
huge
khaki
colored
head
that
left
some
gorgeous
fat
rings
of
lacing
down
the
pint
glass
yep
hopforward
indeed
the
initial
nose
on
this
one
is
all
hops
mostly
the
american
varieties
which
impart
the
standard
grapefruit
and
pine
notes
but
there
is
some
caramel
buried
deep
down
maybe
some
fruitiness
but
as
far
as
i
can
tell
this
is
all
hops
flavor
changes
the
mood
delicious
deeply
caramelized
sugars
molasses
and
dark
fruit
reminiscent
of
plum
and
raisin
make
up
a
bulk
of
the
malt
profile
but
its
extremely
well
balanced
by
the
bitter
pithy
grapefruit
rind
hop
flavor
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
hoppier
than
it
is
but
it
was
brewed
in
december
of
09
so
its
had
the
chance
to
fade
a
bit
which
i
think
has
done
this
beer
some
justice
i
dont
think
i
could
handle
anymore
bitterness
as
i
like
my
barleywines
to
be
maltforward
theres
a
touch
of
chocolaty
flavor
in
there
as
well
but
its
hard
to
tell
with
everything
else
going
on
body
is
thick
an
creamy
light
carbonation
with
the
hop
bite
detracting
from
this
quality
only
minimally
a
great
tasting
beer
but
the
alcohol
makes
itself
known
and
one
bomber
is
more
than
enough
for
me
great
brewskie
here
and
will
enjoy
sipping
on
it
over
the
course
of
the
next
hour
not
my
favorite
abw
but
a
damn
good
one
d
i
could
honestly
crack
another
if
i
had
one
this
one
lived
up
to
the
hype
for
me
in
the
top
3
barleywines
ive
had
got
a
older
version
of
this
as
its
got
the
old
style
lable
pours
a
dark
hazy
ruby
brown
with
a
decent
amount
of
foam
smells
fruity
and
malty
and
the
taste
follow
suits
bitterness
lingers
with
the
mellow
caramal
malty
background
this
is
quite
drinkable
for
the
10
2
and
goes
down
pretty
smooth
this
is
tasty
stuff
d
very
drinkable
could
have
one
entire
bottle
over
an
evening
or
split
between
two
afterwith
dessert
drinkability
is
not
too
bad
for
a
barley
wine
but
it
is
still
a
barley
wine
old
ruffian
has
a
big
and
inyourface
quality
about
it
that
is
striking
even
considering
the
style
and
im
not
surprised
at
all
to
see
that
the
abv
exceeds
10
as
big
ass
kicking
beers
go
old
ruffian
is
still
pretty
drinkable
though
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
poured
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
with
a
small
white
head
nose
is
big
hops
smells
bitter
even
on
this
2007
vintage
taste
has
big
hops
citrus
pine
caramel
background
and
booze
mouthfeel
is
sticky
super
bitter
citrus
and
boozy
but
not
as
hot
as
a
fresh
batch
good
bottled
on
1209
poured
into
a
chimay
glass
redamber
with
a
one
finger
white
head
the
scent
has
a
sugary
smell
to
it
the
taste
being
a
fresh
bottle
has
a
decent
hop
pressence
which
is
supprising
to
my
taste
buds
the
carmel
and
sugar
isnt
too
terribly
strong
in
fact
its
very
smooth
there
is
no
alcohol
pressence
which
is
very
suprising
considering
the
abv
and
age
of
this
vintage
d
definitely
one
of
my
top
5
barleywines
this
beer
is
immensely
enjoyable
and
the
complexity
of
it
is
a
real
treat
the
abv
makes
it
difficult
to
drink
more
than
one
but
thats
okay
d
im
quite
pleased
with
this
one
i
have
an
05
and
im
not
sure
id
enjoy
it
nearly
as
much
as
this
relatively
fresh
iteration
but
im
looking
forward
to
finding
out
d
as
with
many
beers
that
are
similarly
big
i
think
this
is
a
once
in
awhile
treat
it
is
delicious
and
satisfying
but
would
be
too
much
for
both
my
palate
and
mind
to
have
more
than
a
bomber
in
a
sitting
i
would
certainly
have
another
but
not
right
now
pours
a
medium
hazy
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
creamy
off
white
head
good
aromas
of
dark
fruit
caramel
and
piney
hops
more
hops
on
the
palate
this
is
a
very
hoppy
barley
wine
with
a
lot
of
double
ipa
qualities
especially
young
and
fresh
the
hops
are
balanced
nicely
with
some
sweet
malt
and
warming
alcohol
truly
an
awesome
example
of
the
style
i
had
very
high
expectations
for
this
beer
and
have
cherished
the
bottle
for
a
few
months
since
i
bought
it
ive
lookd
forward
to
trying
this
for
a
very
long
time
and
it
was
well
worth
the
wait
good
beer
for
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
an
intense
american
style
barleywine
with
a
ton
of
hops
would
rate
it
higher
but
the
level
of
hops
really
detract
from
the
overall
drinkability
and
22
oz
is
plenty
d
this
beer
was
alright
with
some
age
on
it
i
think
it
had
already
started
to
go
downhill
if
you
keep
this
beer
around
for
a
couple
years
i
would
say
drink
it
if
not
you
might
be
a
little
less
surprised
with
the
flavors
the
best
balanced
barleywine
ever
ever
so
intricately
balanced
just
when
you
think
the
flavors
are
finished
the
wave
of
hops
come
rolling
in
and
keep
everything
in
check
it
takes
a
good
30
seconds
after
the
swallow
for
all
the
flavors
to
do
their
amazing
dance
easy
to
drink
despite
its
heavy
alcohol
presence
well
there
is
a
lot
of
booze
but
you
cant
taste
any
of
it
f
lingering
bitterness
which
is
pretty
nice
and
adds
a
slightly
spicy
hoppy
bitter
hop
flavor
some
sweetness
but
still
dries
well
a
strange
description
i
know
but
its
hard
to
really
get
the
taste
right
the
maltiness
lingers
a
bit
with
some
added
molasses
flavor
and
dried
fruits
lingering
the
bitterness
comes
through
nicely
at
this
point
too
the
booze
doesnt
seem
10
but
definitely
seems
more
than
8
so
hidden
but
not
completely
pours
beautiful
ruby
with
bubbly
tan
head
and
good
lacing
aroma
of
pine
caramel
and
licorice
nice
rich
sweet
flavor
with
a
balanced
bitterness
medium
body
good
carbonation
a
little
oily
but
a
bit
boozy
would
love
to
have
this
with
a
little
age
this
was
an
incredible
brew
now
i
just
need
to
find
a
few
more
and
line
these
up
for
a
vertical
good
beer
ive
been
really
into
barleywines
lately
and
this
is
very
tasty
though
not
necessarily
an
ideal
example
of
the
style
tried
a
22
oz
bomber
of
this
decanted
into
pint
glasses
beautiful
pour
rich
reddish
brown
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
great
retention
aromas
of
bready
sweet

is
the
same
nice
balance
of
the
sweet
maltiness
with
rich
hops
fairly
thick
mouthfeel
appropriate
to
the
flavors
and
aromas
the
alcohol
creeps
up
you
so
watch
out
otherwise
this
is
a
delicious
barleywine
one
i
will
gladly
return
to
in
the
future
a
big
bad
barleywine

doesnt

the
last

one
more
year
overall
this
is
a
beautiful
beautiful
beer
my
criteria
for
a
truly
great
beer
are
simply
as
follows
how
bold
and
complex
is
a
brew
and
how
well
smoothly
are
the
flavors
therein
tied
together
well
old
ruffian
is
brazenly
bold
massively
complex
and
effortlessly
smooth
i
cant
compliment
the
brewers
at
great
divide
enough
for
this
because
my
eloquence
cannot
fairly
and
accurately
describe
how
insanely
great
this
beer
is
for
a
major
hophead
a
nice
barleywine
in
my
case
the
second
bottle
will
sleep
in
the
cellar
for
about
6
years
nice
and
creamy
feel
with
low
but
pleasant
carbonation
medium
body
overall
a
great
example
of
the
style
hoppy
but
not
overly
so
the
flavors
all
play
well
on
each
other
without
much
hint
of
the
strong
abv
taste
is
citrus
infused
ridiculously
decadent
fudge
and
caramel
has
a
boozey
mint
aftertaste
that
is
identical
to
binaca
breath
sprayi
hate
that
stuff
drinkability
was
graded
on
a
curve
as
this
is
obviously
a
huge
beer
but
it
went
down
easy
and
was
a
very
enjoyable
barleywine
that
will
only
get
better
in
time
pours
a
hazy
brownish
red
color
with
a
yellow
stained
head
slight
spotty
lace
upon

is
full
of
citrus
hops
similar
to
grapefruit
nice
amount
of

sweetness
filling
out
the
rest
of
the
aroma
taste
is
better
hoppy
citrus
like
grapefruit
upfront
with
ample
malt
sweetness
to
back
it
finishes
bitter
and
quite
boozy
both
in
warmth
and
in
taste
medium
to
heavy
feel
with
this
beast
and
low
amount
of
carbonation
pretty
good
overall
nice
fresh
hop
and
alcohol
kick
some
time
spent
in
the
cellar
would
have
worked
some
magic
for
this
beer
im
sure
i
am
sorry
but
i
love
the
hoppiness
of
old
guardian
and
especially
bigfoot
this
just
does
not
compare
however
not
comparing
it
has
its
own
place
as
a
pretty
good
brew
it
just
isnt
going
to
be
my
go
to
barleywine
other
that
fall
in
this
category
that
are
quite
good

big

ale
dthis
is
big
and
delicious
very
bitter
and
piney
so
hard
to
drink
it
fast
and
repetitive
definitely
looks
like
an
interesting
beer
to
cellar
as
it
would
definitely
change
over
the
years
however
the
taste
isnt
so
bad
to
stop
me
from
enjoying
this
beer
i
actually
like
the
bitterness
and
appreciate
its
potency
although
i
wish
there
were
more
character
to
the
palate
i
find
it
to
be
a
strong
bodied
appropriately
carbonated
easy
drinking
brew
and
thats
something
to
be
proud
of
with
anything
over
10
after
a
grand
start
and
a
disappointing
middle
old
ruffian
finishes
strong
and
is
worth
a
look
carbonation
is
minimal
and
malty
as
it
warms
but
alcohol
bite
makes
sure
that
this
doesnt
go
down
too
fast
it
is
still
easy
drinking
with
stickiness
lingering
on
the
palate
mmm
good
overall
the
beer
i
had
ontap
seemed
to
pop
a
lot
more
than
the
bottle
and
held
a
good
deal
more
complexity
be
sure
to
give
this
one
another
fair
shot
if
you
werent
terribly
impressed
the
first
time
around
a
bold
and
delicious
barleywine
that
was
well
received
by
the
entire
group
drink
is
a
bit
much
for
a
good
sessionable
beer
but
is
an
excellent
tasting
beer
superb
great
divide
makes
wonderful
beers
and
old
ruffian
is
no
exception
great
fresh
but
i
can
only
imagine
what
its
like
aged
this
is
perhaps
my
favorite
barleywine
now
d
a
good
american
barleywine
for
surenot
the
most
complex
but
very
smooth
poured
an
amberbrown
almost
copper
color

ample

that
dissipated
quickly
to
a
crown
very
balanced
aromas
with
the
malts
and
alcohol
leading
the
way
and
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
citrus
following
malty
backbone
in
the
flavor
that
follows
with
the
piney
hops

chewey
medium
bodied

definite
alcohol

everything
is
as
it
should
be
with
a
great
balance
relatively
smooth
feel
and
a
nice
warm
finish
d
not
huge
on
alcohol
but
its
still
there
its
warming
as
a
good
barleywine
should
be
at
5
99
this
beer
is
one
hell
of
a
deal
that
certainly
helps
the
drinkability
here
about
as
fun
and
easy
to
drink
as
a
barleywine
gets
im
sure
this
is
a
completely
different
beer
in
a
few
years
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thicker
side
and
slightly
creamy
the
carbonation
is
relatively
low
giving
it
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
for
the
style
drinkability
is
good
considering
the
abv
and
i
really
enjoyed
this
on
a
cold
winter
night
this
is
a
very
nicely
made
and
delicious
straight
forward
barley
wine
it
was
very
tasty
but
it
also
scored
major
points
with
me
in
the
look
and
mouthfeel
categories
especially
d
a
very
drinkable
barleywine
but
the
bitterness
makes
it
a
slow
drinker
have
a
feeling
i
wont
be
through
this
over
the
course
of
this
hockey
game
on
tonight
edit
as
this
beer
warms
it
becomes
so
much
more
complex
and
delicious
a
very
strong
beer
but
at
the
same
time
so
delicious
there
are
some
buttery
and
nutty
hints
that
develop
as
it
warms
that
go
so
well
with
the
sweetness
and
dry
hop
bitterness

tonight
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
the
occasion
warming
and
intoxicating
just
as
it
was
meant
to
be
opened
a
2008
bottle
for
a
friends
21st
birthday
taste
is
excellent
tastes
very
stellar
and
fresh
for
a
2
12
year
old
brew
huge
caramel
and
toffee
malts
piny
hops
and
dark
fruit
strangle
the
palate
not
alot
of
heat
for
the
abv
really
a
great
beer
all
around
and
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
for
sure
id
love
to
try
a
bottle
5
years
old
and
see
how
that
holds
up
i
would
highly
recommend
this
for
the
adventurous
beer
drinker
high
alcohol
full
flavor
very
complex
but
not
for
the
weak
at
heart
a
very
attractive
amber
mahogany
color
the
aroma
is
malty
and
sweet
i
can
detect
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
what
smells
like
mandarin
orange
i
was
quite
taken
aback
by
the
flavor
unlike
other
barley
wines
i
have
had
this
one
seems
to
have
a
bit
more
going
on
than
just
malt
it
is
a
little
boozy
tasting
with
plenty
of
caramel
and
bready
malt
sweetness
but
it
also
has
a
nice
amount
of
citrus
hop
flavor
full
body
for
sure
but
it
is
so
smooth
definitely
a
sipper
and
not
the
kind
of
beer
you
would
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
in
a
sitting
d
aggressive
with
the
sweet
malts
and
alcohol
drinable
but
only
within
reason
this
was
aged
just
over
1
year
the
high
11
alcohol
content
allowed
it
to
age
nicely
it
was
still
quite
sharp
and
slightly
astringent
but
good
for
the
style
the
heat
may
have
mellowed
more
if
it
had
sat
back
another
year
very
sweet
and
syrupy
i
identified
toffee
caramel
and
other
sugary
candies
in
the
taste
very
nice
and
worth
checking
out
awesome
american
barley
wine
that
sets
the
standard
for
me
to
other
barley
wines
good
luck
american
barleywines
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
a
good
one
ive
had
better
but
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
dark
brown
appearance
with
lots
of
sediment
making
it
very
cloudy
interestingly
herbal
aroma
with
sweet
maple
syrup
undertones
very
bitter
hoppy
flavor
herbal
hops
left
lots
of
hops
linger
bitterness
hurts
drinkability
a
little
but
still
great
were
the
finish
a
little
drier
i
think
the
overall
taste
and
drinkability
would
be
enhanced
still
a
good
brew
and
worth
having
possibly
the
best
example
of
an
american
bw
that
ive
tried
im
thankful
this
is
a
local
treasure
this
was
a
favorite
of
mine
a
long
while
ago
still
as
great
as
i
remember
overall
i
have
had
this
beer
several
times
from
the
bottle
and
i
must
say
that
this
ontap
version
is
the
way
to
drink
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
much
thicker
and
creamy
as
well
as
a
more
abundant
hop
profile
dont
get
me
wrong
you
cant
go
wrong
either
way
but
ontap
has
the
edge
another
great
beverage
from
great
divide
recommended
drinkability
is
good
but
i
did
need
some
help
with
this
bomber
wish
they
sold
this
in
12oz

beer
is

i
cant
drink
a
beer
like
this
very
quickly
though
full
bodied
almost
like
im
chewing
it
a
nice
strong
bitterness
and
a
lot
of
malt
character
in
the
front
caramel
and
a
nice
sweetness
up
front
slightly
bready
overall
great
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
highly
recommend
i
had
a
three
to
four
year
old
bottle
better
than
new
mellower
malt
in
the
taste
still
aggressive
hop
awesome
i
didnt
change
my
scoring
however
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
the
best
ambw
that
ive
had
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
good
hops
that
are
well
balanced
by
the
malt
you
feel
the
abv
at
then
end
a
bit
but
never
smell
it
or
taste
most
highly
recommend
worthy
of
the
t100
rank
rotation
avail
here
in
tx
in
bottle
and
tap
at
fsgm
ive
had
at
the
brewery
on
tap
and
finally
got
around
to
reviewing
it
should
have
done
sooner
as
this
will
earn
a
spot
in
the
occasional
rotation
another
amazing
offering
by
great
divide
their
hibernation
has
been
my
goto
beer
for
the
last
month
or
so
if
i
lived
in
denver
id
be
a
fixture
in
their
tap
room
i
would
definitely
share
this
with
a
friend
though
because
this
bottle
kicked
my
ass
once
i
finished
it
this
beer
could
age
for
many
many
more
years
considering
how
it
is
at
this
stage
i
just
wish
i
knew
how
old
this
one
actually
is
its
still
got
tons
of
power
behind
drinkability
this
is
a
first
rate
american
style
barleywine
and
i
hate
to
come
to
the
end
of
it
this
one
is
dangerously
drinkable
at
its
high
abv
im
sure
ill
be
having
this
one
again
and
im
already
mentally
adding
it
to
my
shopping
list
sweet
aftertaste
medium
heavy
body
thick
and
creamy
has
a
bit
of
a
warming
feeling
to
it
really
nice
balance
to
the
beer
alcohol
is
well
hidden
very
drinkable
barleywine
d
fairly
drinkable
for
the
style
but
as
it
warms
up
the
alcohol
becomes
more
prevalent
and
cuts
down
the
drinkability
a
bit
for
me
d
this
is
a
very
nice
barleywine
my
sample
was
fresh
from
the
2009
vintage
it
felt
like
it
could
stand
some
aging
to
even
out
the
rough
edges
but
was
quite
nice
given
its
youth
ill
revisit
this
one
again
i
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bottle
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
deep
caramel
with
a
big
sticky
white
head
the
aroma
was
hop
forward
with
multiple
layers
of
alternating
sweetness
and
floral
notes
the
flavor
was
complex
big
sweet
caramel
notes
are
paired
well
with
big
piney
citrus
to
create
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
the
alcohol
is
perfectly
hidden
until
the
finish
leaving
a
warming
taste
in
the
back
of
the
throat
the
beer
is
a
well
made
full
bodied
sipper
perhaps
the
best
barleywine
i
have
had
drinkability
similar
to
bigfoot
but
maybe
a
notch
better
great
barleywine
but
still
a
little
hard
to
drink
too
much
of
it
pours
a
cloudy
ambercopper
color
12
inch
head
of
a
pale
tan
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
sweet
malt
dark
citrus
and
caramel
fits
the
style
of
an
american
barleywine
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
alcohol
strong
slight
roasted
malt
citrus
slight
hop
and
sweet
malt
background
overall
a
strong
alcohol
characteristic
but
good
body
definitely
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
night
im
enjoying
this
one
quite
a
bit
overall
impressions
this
is
the
first
barleywine
that
i
can
recall
having
really
a
very
enjoyable
drinking
experience
that
gets
even
better
as
the
beer
warms
towards
room
temperature
the
good
hop
bitterness
is
typical
of
the
american
barleywine
style
from
what
i
have
read
i
would
certainly
buy
and
drink
again
d
super
hoppy
super
malty
and
appreciable
alcohol
content
everything
blends
well
and
makes
for
a
great
barleywine
md
smoothly
textured
with
a
sticky
malty
finish
far
less
heavy
than
the
style
and
alcohol
content
lead
on
very
drinkable
but
the
alcohol
catches
up
quickly
overall
this
is
ok
but
nothing
super
special
always
a
good
bw
that
i
have
never
taken
the
time
to
review
need
to
track
down
a
fresh
bottle
to
see
how
the
hops
play
out
an
excellent
barleywine
and
at
over
two
years
of
age
it
still
has
plenty
of
room
to
grow
d
great
a
really
nice
barleywine
i
wanna
find
one
of
these
fresh
now
with
age
on
it
which
this
one
obviously
had
due
to
the
dust
on
it
before
i
bought
it
and
the
small
amount
of
hops
really
nice
and
delicious
this
beer
is
not
very
sessionable
as
it
is
very
strong
but
for
a
bad
ass
barleywine
the
price
is
right
cant
wait
to
try
a
fresh
one
to
compare
the
two
d
this
beer
ages
very
well
and
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
ill
definately
be
picking
up
more
of
this
vintage
for
the
cellar
recommended
this
is
a
fantastic
barleywine
i
definitely
need
to
put
a
couple
of
these
down
for
a
little
while
to
see
how
they
improve
with
age
poured
a
beautiful
clear
copper
with
a
dense
cream
head
even
after
a
year
of
age
this
beers
had
tons
of
piney
bitterness
though
no
citrus
hops
and
a
wonderful
husky
malt
profile
bready
and
biscuity
with
a
perfect
hop
bite
wonderful
first
off
this
beer
looks
gorgeous
it
has
a
perfect
caramel
color
and
pours
with
as
perfect
a
head
as
ive
ever
seen
tastewise
this
beer
is
well
balanced
with
a
nice
hoppy
and
malty
feel
i
wish
the
taste
was
more
complex
but
all
in
all
its
a
solid
example
of
the
style
dark
amber
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
caramel
malts
taste
is
caramelmaltshopsdark
fruits
and
alcohol
on
the
very
end
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
was
worth
the
7
99
i
paid
for
22
oz
like
all
the
beers
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
i
recommend
and
would
purchase
again
i
read
some
of
the
reviews
and
i
agree
with
most
so
i
am
not
going
to
repeat
what
i
will
say
is
that
this
is
a
prime
example
of
an
american
barleywine
there
is
nothing
to
offensive
about
but
nothing
that
stands
out
from
other
american
barleywines
it
is
a
sweet
hoppy
heavy
sipper
that
hides
10
very
well
i
rated
every
category
at
a
4
0
just
because
nothing
stood
out
to
me
but
all
categories
were
a
good
example
d
though
i
cant
quite
pinpoint
why
though
im
guessing
the
mouthfeel
old
ruffian
is
quite
drinkable
despite
the
abv
and
the
bitterness
somehow
its
going
down
quite
smoothly
fantastic
balance
here
d
the
first
barley
wine
ive
had
and
i
really
like
it
im
really
surprised
at
how
balanced
this
is
its
really
a
great
sipper
beer
for
me
certainly
this
is
a
barleywine
for
hopheads
though
this
isnt
to
say
other
intense
tastes
dont
compete
for
your
attention
i
can
see
how
barrel
aging
or
extended
cellaring
might
bring
the
profile
into
a
more
evenly
balanced
arrangement
very
well
executed
and
very
much
an
american
barleywine
quite
an
assertive
departure
from
the
template
drawn
by
the
english
style
caramel
colored
in
appearance
with
a
humongous
tan
head
leaves
sticky
chunky
lacing
all
the
way
alcohol
is
wellhidden
in
this
sweet
beer
toffee
caramel
and
red
apple
buttery
toffee
in
the
smell
and
taste
big
time
taste
of
sugar
babies
candy
great
example
highly
recommended
this
is
one
of
the
most
amazing
beers
ive
ever
had
absolutely
intense
malt
and
hop
flavors
very
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
just
fine
for
a
barleywine
alcohol
is
very
noticeable
this
is
an
absolute
beast
of
a
beer
and
i
can
sure
see
why
it
is
rated
so
high
i
am
going
to
have
to
grab
some
of
these
for
the
cellar
light
malty
and
alcohol
aroma
i
couldnt
detect
any
hops
it
poured
with
a
light
brown
head
and
clear
dark
amber
color
the
lacing
was
light
and
the
head
dwindled
but
remained
to
the
end
at
first
sip
the
bitterness
takes
the
initial
attack
and
remains
to
the
next
sip
it
had
a
nice
sweet
malty
palate
with
a
long
lingering
hint
of
vanilla
and
a
dry
finish
very
well
balanced
flavors
this
is
a
very
drinkable
barelywine
thanks
to
the
delicious
and
generous
use
of
hops
mouthfeel
was
nothing
but
smoooth
this
was
one
slick
beer
d
not
too
drinkable
given
the
high
octane
character
of
the
beer
maybe
if
id
waited
a
little
bit
longer
the
alcohol
would
have
mellowed
out
or
had
it
a
bit
earlier
and
allowed
the
hops
to
mask
some
of
the
alcohol
a
rich
and
satisfying
barleywine
this
is
right
up
there
with
bigfoot
and
my
personal
favorite
smuttynose
really
a
beautiful
beer
amber
to
red
color
clear
tan
half
inch
head
most
of
which
lingered
around
pretty
this
bottle
i
think
is
over
six
months
old
aged
it
has
the
old
graphic
and
the
new
looking
ones
have
a
bottled
date
of
1509
hoppy
butterscotch
aroma
very
inviting
some
stickiness
flavor
follows
aroma
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
wait
that
malt
is
followed
with
bitterness
this
beer
has
many
levels
overall
smooth
but
with
some
good
hop
thrashings
in
all
the
right
spots
its
a
strong
beer
but
its
soooo
good
dangerous
d
a
fantastic
american
barleywine
well
deserving
of
its
reputation
feel
just
a
bit
short
of
fred
and
bigfoot
in
my
book
but
thats
a
pretty
elite
crew
to
even
get
mentioned
ive
been
a
great
divide
fan
for
some
time
and
this
is
just
another
feather
in
their
cap
great
way
to
kick
off
the
nfl
season
lived
up
to
the
hype
a
great
brew
that
all
beer
lovers
should
try
overall
this
is
a
very
balanced
if
ridiculously
potent
beer
the
10
a
b
v
is
not
very
dangerous
with
this
one
as
it
is
a
brew
that
makes
you
sip
to
appreciate
its
wholesome
malty
boozy
goodness
quite
a
pleasing
version
of
the
styleas
will
be
noted
by
the
number
of
s
in
this
review
on
the
aging
the
alcohol
mellowed
slightly
the
hops
were
still
bitter
but
sweeter
which
made
this
beer
maybe
a
touch
sweeter
than
i
had
hoped
and
the
dark
fruit
notes
seemed
to
be
lost
in
the
sweetness
would
like
to
try
a
fresher
one
soon
d
very
high
for
a
barleywine
this
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
incredible
for
a
10
beer
the
palate
really
packs
a
wide
range
of
character
perfect
blend
of
hard
hitting
hops
and
sweet
malt
and
a
very
pleasant
abv
presence
overall
not
a
bad
barlywine
but
to
me
it
is
nothing
too
special
id
easily
drink
it
again
but
nothing
i
would
go
crazy
for
i
think
trying
this
fresh
would
be
a
fun
experience
i
look
for
great
divide
beers
with
happy
thoughts
but
i
dont
need
to
drink
this
one
again
no
sir
i
cant
finish
this
id
say
i
recd
a
bad
bottle
but
the
wife
says
bish
so
its
just
that
it
disagrees
with
me
badly
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
huge
disappointment
d
good
dessert
beer
nice
and
heavy
however
i
mistakenly
paired
this
with
chocolate
cake
because
i
assumed
it
would
be
sweeter
and
i
got
more
of
the
bitterness
of
this
beer
than
i
should
have
id
say
that
it
would
make
a
great
dessert
by
itself
without
any
food
pairing
sippable
and
complex
d
moderate
to
moderately
high
you
only
want
one
but
its
a
joy
to
drink
and
goes
down
incredibly
easy
considering
the
abv
a
quality
brew
do
not
hesitate
to
seek
this
one
out
very
well
puttogether
d
very
good
beer
if
you
ask
me
i
dont
know
if
it
absolutely
crushes
other
american
barleywines
out
there
still
it
is
up
there
and
is
quite
enjoyable
as
the
drinking
experience
goes
on
getting
through
the
bomber
my
lady
wasnt
into
this
one
due
to
the
hops
presence
was
a
bit
of
a
chore
this
beer
does
tend
to
wiegh
heavir
and
heavier
as
the
experience
goes
on
still
its
damn
good
in
the
other
arenas
wonderfully
complex
and
delicious
this
makes
a
perfect
dessert
and
nightcap
or
just
a
nicely
balanced
big
beer
for
any
lover
of
malt
or
hops
could
easily
age
for
at
least
a
few
years
id
love
to
sample
a
fresher
version
as
well
as
one
cellared
a
while
longer
quite
easydrinking
though
heavy
on
the
head
at
such
a
hefty
10
2
abv
as
i
poured
more
into
my
snifter
after
the

halfglass
i
thought
i
had
consumed
half
the
bottle
already
i
was
quite
mistaken
and
as
i
poured
the
final
twothirds
i
realized
my
error
a
bomber
goes
down
quite
easily
though
my
full
stomach
and
heavy
head
are
now
regretting
that
ease
its
a
pleasant
regret
though
no
worries
deep
amber
with
an
inch
head
that
faded
quickly
citrus
was
the
only
aroma
that
i
could
get
taste
was
like
sugared
grapefruit
initially
with
a
molasses
sweetness
going
down
but
a
bitter
hops
aftertaste
showing
up
at
the
back
of
the
throat
it
feels
creamy
to
the
mouth
much
fuller
than
it
looks
though
not
oily
drinkability
was
good
i
had
no
problem
with
a
bomber
old
ruffian
warms
up
well
d
the
sweetness
is
a
little
high
but
the
amount
of
carbonation
makes
it
easier
to
drink
for
a
barley
wine
pours
slightly
hazed

with
glorious
white
foamy

that
retains
well
and

nose
is
the
traditional
caramel
with
piney
hops
without
a
flaw
to
mention
palate
is
big
and
sweet
with
the
hops
carrying
through
almost
like
a
citrus
cough
drop
that
youd
enjoy
for
the
taste

even
if
not
suffering
from

finishes
chewy
caramel
sweet
done
of
the
best
and
most
drinkable
barleywines
ive
had
so
balanced
what
a
fantastic
beer
i
picked
this
up
and
decided
to
give
it
a
try
i
have
had
numerous
great
divide
offerings
and
this
is
on
par
with
the
other
beers
that
i
have
tried
from
them
a
good
example
of
an
american
barleywine
i
would
definatley
have
this
again
a
smooth
sipping
beer
that
could
prove
to
be
dangerous
due
to
its
combination
of
strength
and
ease
of
drinking
this
beer
is
a
dark
coppery
red
the
reveals
a
big
head
upon
pouring
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
caramel
and
really
has
a
fantastic
aroma
that
is
out
of
this
world
and
hard
for
me
to
pinpoint
the
taste
is
strong
and
has
an
exceptional
roasted
flavor
with
a
bite
that
is
tempered
by
the
caramel
and
sugar
sweetness
although
this
beer
is
strong
it
is
very
drinkable
any
time
of
the
year
i
just
wish
next
time
it
makes
a
little
longer
than
a
week
in
my
beer
cellar
to
let
it
age
this
bottle
is
from
winter
0809
so
about
78
months
old
the
flavours
are
relatively
simple
yet
powerfully
complex
i
like
that
in
a
beer
i
dont
need
12
different
malts
and
12
different
hops
this
is
everything
a
barleywine
should
be
fantastic
d
very
easy
drinking
for
such
a
big
beer
a
big
hop
kick
from
this
barley
wine
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
a
very
good
beer
d
very
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
excellent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
stronger
beer
that
worth
either
sipping
on
for
a
while
or
trying
to
pound
down
for
as
long
as
you
can
handle
it
d
a
thick
heavy
complex
barleywine
the
flavors
come
together
to
create
a
beer
fits
the
style
profile
perfectly
the
hops
work
very
well
with
the
malt
and
create
a
lot
of
complexity
in
the
finish
d
the
carbonation
helps
out
here
actuallykeeps
it
moving
very
tasty
with
many
robust
flavors
worth
seeking
out
after
a
rich
cascade
action
a
very
sizable
tan
head
floats
above
a
clear
dark
amberbrown
body
lace
sticks
all
over
the

loads
of

big

of
sweet

by

spicy

this
beer
has
some
bite
very
nice
barley
would
like
to
see
one
of
these
aged
for
a
couple
years
d
there
arent
enough
accolades
to
describe
this
epic
offering
from
great
divide
im
continually
impressed
by
great
divide
and
this
is
their
best
a
good
barleywine
but
not
the
best
great
divide
is
usually
very
aggressive
with
hops
but
not
with
this
american
barleywine
is
distinguished
by
its
bitterness
combine
with
malty
strength
and
although
this
has
the
latter
it
certainly
lacks
in
the
former
its
worth
trying
but
great
divide
makes
a
number
of
better
ales
including
its
hercules
and
hybernation
ales
d
a
very
drinkable
high
abv
americanstyled
barleywine
with
strong
hops
and
smooth
but
full
mouthfeel
an
exceptional
version
of
the
style
right
on
par
with
the
brewerys
other
offerings
formidable
to
say
the
least
pours
a
really
nice
amberruby
color
very
red
with
an
offwhite
head
smell
is
very
sweet
with
a
noticeable
hop
presence
but
its
not
super
strong
very
hoppy
taste
with
some
sweetness
underneath
it
a
candylike
caramel
sweetness
not
malty
reminiscent
of
sn
bigfoot
somewhat
with
less
sweetness
very
floral
hops
with
maybe
some
grapefruit
fairly
tart
mouth
has
a
bit
of
acridity
to
it
but
has
a
nice
body
full
but
not
heavy
drink
is
definitely
good
but
not
great
acridity
to
the
gflavor
takes
it
down
a
bit
but
im
curious
to
see
if
this
was
a
fresher
bottle
or
not
very
american
barleywine
walking
the
line
of
a
sweet
dipa
drinkable
but
not
as
much
as
some
other
american
barleywines
but
its
ok
slightly
warming
and
sour
pours
an

a
small
beige

that

and
also

flavor
is

this
beer
would
improve
with
age
no
doubt
d
a
good
american
barleywine
but
behemoth
is
a
better
choice
in
my
opinion
not
a
huge
fan
so
this
will
probably
be
my
only
experience
with
this
beer
starts
somewhat
prickly
becoming
very
creamy
not
light
bodied
of
course
but
lighter
than
one
might
expect
medium
goes
down
smooth
as
a
sipper
drinkability
again
a
little
time
would
do
this
one
good
this
was
very
bitter
and
very
hot
very
delicious
but
very
bitter
and
very
hot
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
a
bottle
or
two
of
my
own
edit

just
depends
on
the
mood
youre
in
this
is
disappearing
quick
tonight
for
a
barleywine
of
10
abv
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
neither
the
hops
nor
barley
are
cloying
perfectly
balanced
overall
a
righteous
example
of
an
american
barleywine
and
this
is
instantly
my
new
favorite
of
this
style
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
this
is
a
great
beer
tons
of
bold
flavor
a
huge
alcohol
kick
as
well
seek
this
out
its
been
a
while
since
i
tried
a
new
style
and
thought
i
should
give
barley
wines
a
try
so
as
my
first
barley
wine
ever
i
thought
it
was
good
this
is
a
little
to
boozy
for
me
though
to
drink
more
then
one
i
definitely
will
seek
out
other
barley
wines
and
compare
watch
out
when
you
drink
this
one
it
will
go
down
faster
than
you
may
think
and
its
got
the
power
to
lay
you
out
d
a
well
rounded
beer
its
definitely
a
sipper
but
one
that
i
enjoyed
during
the
entirety
of
drinking
it
taste
is
thick
and
creamy
bitter
malty
burnt
caramel
some
spice
bitter
in
the
end
again
a
very
nice
barleywine
that
could
use
more
aging
to
it
strong
hoppy
and
has
a
lot
of
cellaring
potential
check
it
out
old
ruffian
bw
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
nice
brown
redish
color
with
off
white
head
that
lasts
for
ever
smells
good
not
much
exceptional
smells
but
i
like
the
alcohol
as
the
beer
warms
tastes
a
bit
too
sweet
compared
to
other
bws
but
i
love
the
hops
in
this
beer
much
more
pronounced
than
other
bws
the
alcohol
is
there
in
the
taste
but
not
overwhelming
just
warming
the
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
as
it
warms
the
alcohols
comes
out
and
it
became
harder
for
me
to
finish
but
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
overall
i
love
barleywines
and
i
really
love
great
divide
ive
yet
to
have
a
less
than
stellar
beer
from
them
and
this
is
no
exception
old
ruffian
along
with
the
oakaged
yeti
imperial
stout
and
hercules
double
ipa
is
one
of
the
most
dependable
beers
on
the
market
this
bottle
that
ive
enjoyed
was
still
a
bit
young
and
fiery
but
i
can
tell
that
the
other
one
i
have
will
taste
ten
times
better
next
year
come
to
think
of
it
i
did
see
a
couple
bottles
at
the
store
with
the
old
labels
guess
i
should
make
my
way
back
and
buy
them
if
they
are
still
there
because
this
one
is
a
keeper
d
i
put
off
trading
for
this
beer
for
a
long
time
and
ended
up
getting
it
as
an
extra
it
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
easily
available
beers
ive
ever
had
poured
red
brown
cloudy
hue
with
large
frothy
head
that
mostly
lasted
with
good
lacing
complex
aroma
of
bread
malt
citrus
and
alcohol
full
body
with
thick
texture
and
flat
carbonation
complex
flavor
of
sweet
complex
fruit
and
medium
bittersweet
alcohol
bite
finish
of
long
duration
mouthfeel
is
perfect
and
this
ones
fairly
drinkable
if
there
is
such
a
thing
for
huge
barly
wines
excellent
all
around
d
solid
at
10
a
tad
boozey
to
drink
more
than
a
bomber
excellent
barleywine
d
considering
this
is
a
bw
its
hard
to
call
this
very
drinkable
the
abv
is
over
the
top
of
course
and
the
flavors
are
very
potent
not
filling
which
at
least
lends
itself
to
be
matched
with
a
good
session
beer
this
is
a
really
great
beer
im
going
to
seek
it
out
again
it
is
actually
not
as
bitter
and
extreme
as
others
in
the
style
ive
had
but
it
is
probably
one
of
the
best
poured
a
reddish
amber
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
laced
the
glass
some
good
noticeable
bubble
action
up
the
sides
of
the
glass
really
nice
powerful
aromas
of
sweet
fruity
caramel
malts
and
citruspine
hops
with
some
alcohol
the
initial
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malt
and
alcohol
almost
butterscotchy
then
the
hops
show
up
grapefruit
woody
pine
and
then
the
bitterness
kicks
in
but
its
a
good
bitterness
bite
mixed
with
spicy
warm
alcohol
the
bitterness
lingered
for
quite
a
while
lots
of
flavors
going
on
very
nice
the
feel
is
not
too
heavy
just
right
as
is
the
carbonation
it
is
strong
in
alcohol
and
flavor
so
i
would
recommend
sharing
this
with
someone
drinkability
on
this
is
tough
id
imagine
finishing
a
bomber
by
yourself
would
be
pretty
difficult
its
certainly
a
sipper
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
beer
i
would
compare
it
to
lagunitas
hairy
eyeball
ale
but
much
less
bitter
and
more
drinkable

nice

definetely
a

drinkability
is

lends
itself
well
too
aging
im
guessing
i
bet
the
oak
and
barrel
aged
versions
of
this
are
even
better
i
just
tend
to
enjoy
the
malt
inclined
versions
a
little
more
i
will
say
this
improves
nicely
as
it
warms
though
some
of
the
edge
is
taken
off
dmoderate
drinkability
an
appropriate
american
barleywine
with
a
strong
hop
emphasis
good
but
not
the
best
a
very
great
drink
and
i
will
absolutely
seek
it
out
again
d
a
fine
brew
but
not
one
to
be
gulped
down
recklessly
this
is
a
beer
that
demands
to
be
sipped
and
contemplated
split
a
bomber
with
a
friend
after
dinner
d
this
is
one
huge
barely
wine
i
really
like
it
now
but
think
that
with
a
year
of
so
of
aging
this
would
easily
turn
into
one
of
my
favorites
the
pronouncement
of
the
hops
in
the
one
is
a
bit
overwhelming
and
with
aging
that
would
likely
become
more
subdued
with
many
other
flavors
coming
to
life
if
you
value
your
life
take
caution
with
this
and
barleywines
et
al
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
an
amber
color
with
twofingers
of
dijonmustardcolored
head
the
retention
as
a
cap
was
very
good
and
the
lacing
equally
good
a
great
looking
beer
all
around
the
aroma
was
complex
and
appealing
caramel
toffee
alcohol
some
rich
esters
wood
hazelnuts
and
candy
sugar
the
flavors
were
equally
complex
and
beautifully
balanced
i
tasted
lost
of
things
starting
with
the
sweetness
of
caramel
malt
chocolate
malt
and
honey
the
fruity
alcohol
esters
and
well
developed
pine
and
herbal
hops
flavors
concealed
the
alcohol
well
and
helped
the
beer
be
unusually
crisp
for
a
barleywine
as
it
warmed
it
continued
to
develop
and
i
definitely
smelled
more
hops
presence
in
the
aroma
i
really
enjoyed
the
sweettowoodytobitter
arc
of
the
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
full
and
the
carbonation
soft
the
girl
i
shared
this
beer
with
a
sudsaficionado
herself
agreed
with
me
that
this
was
a
marvelously
complex
offering
and
the
best
barleywine
either
of
us
had
ever
had
overall
please
take
this
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
i
love
hops
and
i
love
barleywines
however
after
many
attempts
i
just
dont
seem
to
be
a
big
fan
of
mixing
the
two
together
i
bet
this
one
would
be
awesome
if
it
were
layed
down
for
a
few
years
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
wouldnt
drink
a
ton
of
this
though
because
it
is
pretty
heavy
as
most
bws
are
overall
a
fantastic
great
tasting
beer
its
not
extremely
hoppy
like
you
find
with
a
lot
of
american
barleywines
instead
theres
a
great
distinct
flavoring
between
the
hops
very
higly
recommended
one
of
my
favorites
m
sticky
medium
bodied
lots
of
carbonation
or
seems
like
it
hell
i
cant
really
tell
whether
something
is
very
carbonated
or
just
medium
carbonation
because
i
dont
really
have
a
max
threshold
here
anyway
hey
its
a
good
beer
to
my
uncultured
taste
buds
this
is
closer
to
a
malty
dipa
than
a
barleywine
by
far
on
the
hoppier
side
rather
than
the
maltier
side
the
malty
sweetness
is
there
just
buried
under
a
layer
of
pleasent
hop
bity
very
piny
on
the
back
palate
while
the
sweetness
lingers
a
bit
on
the
front
palate
a
little
bit
leathery
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
hoppy
beers
but
this
is
working
for
me
id
rather
a
hoppy
barlywine
than
a
malty
dipa
if
that
makes
sense
pretty
creamy
and
smooth
for
something
a
little
bit
boozey
but
i
think
the
hop
bitterness
also
enhances
the
alcohol
effect
if
it
werent
so
hoppy
it
would
hide
it
very
well
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
for
me
but
quite
pleasant
i
can
see
why
it
gets
the
respose
it
does
taste
is
exceptional
perfect
unfuckingbelievable
this
is
easily
the
best
beer
ive
had
this
year
fullbodied
and
strong
the
alcohol
is
present
but
not
distracting
highly
drinkable
i
could
totally
go
for
another
this
one
pours
out
a
very
hazy
copper
color
with
a
beautiful
tanoffwhite
sticky
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
leaving
all
kinds
of
lacing
this
one
is
just
beautiful
other
than
the
haze
i
can
forgive
the
haziness
a
bit
for
the
other
wonderful
aspects
the
smell
is
full
of
sweet
malts
darker
crystals
maybe
a
bit
of
chocolate
a
great
caramelly
sweetness
with
just
a
bit
of
piney
citrusy
hops
in
the
background
a
very
pleasant
aroma
that
invites
you
to
drink
the
taste
gives
an
intense
bitterness
along
with
an
initial
alcohol
burn
though
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
malty
balance
there
is
a
distinct
breadiness
backed
by
crystal
malts
with
a
bit
of
a
chocolatey
back
i
also
detect
some
citrus
peel
with
that
piney
feeling
not
much
in
terms
of
resiny
qualties
though
theres
a
hint
of
golden
raisins
overall
a
great
flavor
but
not
the
best
ive
had
in
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
good
carbonation
levels
a
nice
kind
of
chewy
feel
but
theres
a
hint
of
thinness
at
some
points
the
alcohols
hits
you
even
with
a
bit
of
age
and
the
bitterness
persists
the
drinkability
is
nice
definitely
good
to
the
last
drop
but
it
starts
to
hit
hard
quickly
worth
a
shot
to
all
pours
a
dark
brown
colored
body
pretty
clear
with
a
small
diminishing
head
offwhite
in
color
has
a
malty
sugary
sweet
aroma
molasses
aroma
but
sickly
sweet
hoppy
sweet
taste
sugary
piney
smoother
as
it
warms
up
notes
benchmark
overall
great
barley
wine
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
i
will
be
getting
this
again
overall
well
carbonated
and
fairly
smooth
if
it
werent
for
the
strong
alcohol
taste
i
could
bump
up
the
drinkability
more
still
a
very
good
barleywine
worth
picking
up
d
terrible
i
am
not
looking
forward
to
finishing
this
whole
bomber
edit
got
another
bottle
in
a
trade
and
had
it
all
to
myself
nothing
has
changed
except
the
score
for
appearance
has
gone
up
it
looks
totally
different
from
the
other
one
i
had
and
is
a
bit
hoppier
fantastic
beer
overall
impression
overall
this
is
just
too
bitter
for
me
especially
for
the
style
i
love
hops
but
want
to
taste
the
flavors
not
just
the
crushing
bitterness
about
halfway
through
i
pulled
out
some
almonds
and
that
pairing
really
helped
this
is
a
young
bottle
just
over
a
month
old
i
really
think
this
would
be
better
served
after
aging
brew
poured
to
a
nice
deep
amber
color
with
a
good
sized
light
tan
head
that
has
good
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
very
sweet
caramel
and
huge
amounts
of
hops
the
sweet
aroma
is
more
than
just
the
caramel
but
i
am
having
a
hard
time
placing
it
also
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
scent
but
all
of
these
aromas
mixed
together
are
very
inviting
the
flavor
is
also
very
nice
the
malt
seems
to
come
to
life
a
bit
here
with
a
dark
sweet
fruit
mix
and
carameltoffee
there
is
big
hop
presence
here
but
it
is
not
as
overwhelming
as
i
thought
it
would
though
it
does
dominate
the
tail
end
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
slickcreamy
feel
with
adequate
carbonation
alcohol
becomes
more
noticeable
as
the
brew
warms
and
provides
a
welcome
warming
feel
good
brew
will
wand
to
see
if
i
can
track
down
the
other
offerings
of
this
one
d
an
example
of
how
to
brew
an
american
barleywineand
how
to
make
a
drinkable
american
barleywine
in
the
sense
that
it
is
a
big
boozy
barleywine
but
doesnt
lack
for
the
fresh
hops
and
the
malt
is
substantial
enough
to
keeep
the
pace
this
barleywine
doesnt
come
across
as
an
alcohol
bomb
or
have
overly
sweet
residual
malt
flavors
eitherit
finishes
with
the
hops
resonating
as
the
style
should
d
the
abvs
a
bit
high
but
interesting
enough
drink
ive
not
had
a
lot
of
barley
wines
but
this
ones
the
best
ive
had
pours
a
crystal
clear
dark
orange
with
dense
eggshell
colored
head
thick
lacing
smell
grapefruit
and
floral
hops
with
a
sweet
caramel
note
that
pushes
its
way
through
accompanied
by
an
effervescent
alcohol
whiff
candied
citrus
taste
very
sweet
caramel
merges
with
a
whole
lot
of
pine
hops
white
grapefruit
and
orange
dried
pineapple
leafy
and
earthy
and
mildly
boozy
finish
mouthfeel
on
the
full
side
smooth
with
a
serious
bitter
drying
the
sticky
dryness
gets
a
bit
intense
halfway
through
the
bomber
but
thats
why
they
made
water
very
nice
hopforward
but
actually
fairly
balanced
barleywine
easy
to
sip
on
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
bws
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
little
alchy
kick
in
the
back
smooth
with
a
nice
carbonation
very
nice
really
an
epitome
of
what
any
brewery
should
really
shoot
for
though
i
havent
had
that
many
barleywines
this
is
no
doubt
one
of
the
best
ive
had
so
far
second
only
to
3f
behemoth
wish
there
were
more
malts
in
this
beer
tasted
more
like
a
double
ipa
than
a
barleywine
sweetness
of
the
malts
came
out
in
the
smell
but
werent
very
much
present
in
the
taste
over
all
drink
ability
was
average
would
not
be
my
first
choice
for
this
style
very
drinkable
overall
the
high
alcohol
content
is
quite
concealed
though
be
careful
cause
this
one
will
slam
you
quick
very
good
beer
will
be
getting
some
and
cellering
it
to
see
what
time
does
to
it
old
ruffian
probably
could
use
some
cellar
time
to
smooth
out
the
ruff
edges
so
buy
a
few
bottles
and
lay
them
down
for
future
imbibing
not
mindblowingly
spectacular
but
still
a
decent
hopheads
brew
having
this
one
a
second
time
1230
it
comes
through
as
much
more
of
a
hop
bomb
still
a
fantastic
brew
and
im
not
knocking
any
points
off
of
the
score
but
im
thinking
this
would
be
a
good
candidate
for
aging
and
that
my
first
experience
was
a
slightly
aged
version
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
the
only
hint
that
it
is
high
in
alcohol
is
the
delayed
warming
sensation
in
my
belly
i
really
like
this
and
i
will
seek
it
out
again
d
really
great
beer
than
can
get
people
into
the
style
my
personal
thing
with
this
beer
is
to
either
drink
it
fresh
and
have
it
rip
your
throat
out
or
wait
a
year
and
see
where
you
stand
this
bottle
could
stand
a
little
more
time
though
it
is
very
enjoyable
a
staple
in
the
cellar
of
fridge
of
any
beer
geek
d
a
very
well
balanced
beverage
that
i
could
drink
for
a
long
time
complex
enough
to
keep
me
drinking
it
throughout
the
night
big
and
bittersweet
very
tasty
im
enjoying
this
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
next
time
i
might
seek
out
a
fresher
bottle
to
see
how
hoppy
it
is
when
new
it
is
a
potent
weapon
in
anyones
beer
arsenal
a
quite
lovely
barleywine
indeed
thanks
again
great
divide
the
lord
bless
the
hop
harvest
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
pretty
full
bodied
medium
carbonation
drinkability
just
what
i
was
hoping
for
a
hopped
up
american
barleywine
this
is
an
excellent
rendition
of
the
style
with
a
bit
more
on
the
ibus
but
that
is
what
i
like
drinkability
wonderful
sipping
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
regardless
of
style
pours
a
deep
copperamber
color
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
but
leaves
a
sticky
collar
of
bubbles
tis
a
crisp
and
clean
tasting
barley
wine
with
a
focus
on
the
hops
lots
of
hops
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
small
1
finger
head
on
the
bottle
it
is
described
as
a
hop
forward
barley
wine
they
werent
lying
the
hops
explode
out
of
the
glass
as
soon
as
i
begin
to
bring
it
up
for
a
taste
lots
of
bittering
hops
very
sweet
malt
taste
to
balance
nicely
only
downfall
was
that
it
really
was
a
tongue
bruiser
can
only
think
of
drinking
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
other
than
that
a
great
brew
drinkability
i
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
lots
of
hops
not
to
mention
barleywine
the
ibus
alcohol
and
price
on
this
one
make
it
an
occasional
sipping
brew
but
nonetheless
a
treat
purchased
this
bomber
at
a
hyvee
grocery
store
in
st
joseph
mo
i
really
love
this
beer
i
havent
had
too
many
of
this
style
but
this
is
the
best
one
ive
had
yet
the
drink
starts
out
mild
and
then
explodes
with
falvor
which
is
probably
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
malty
sweetness
up
front
alcohol
makes
itself
known
at
the
front
of
the
mouthful
but
mixes
well
i
cant
place
the
type
of
hops
that
come
out
once
the
drinks
good
and
in
your
mouth
theyre
great
though
drinkability
overhopped
and
overhyped
not
for
me
certainly
a
sipper
and
enjoyably
warming
not
all
of
my
favorite
characteristics
but
a
solid
flavor
structure
makes
it
enjoyable
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
an
american
bw
ive
had
and
very
drinkable
for
the
style
highly
recommended
d
the
high
abv
makes
this
one
a
one
and
done
type
of
beer
the
taste
and
availability
makes
it
so
that
its
one
ill
revisit
time
and
time
again
check
this
one
out
if
you
havnt
already

the
aroma
is
quite
powerful

sweet

and
sweeter

the
taste
is
also
quite
good

noticeable

i
will
be
drinking
this
at
any
chance
available
delicious
i
hope
i
can
keep
finding
it
around
here
the
alcohol
is
initially
in
the
taste
but
seems
to
fade
as
the
sip
and
taste
take
effect
d
very
high
the
only
thing
holding
me
back
from
downing
another
bomber
is
the
10
2
abv
the
taste
is
very
complex
and
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
drinkability
considering
the
alcohol
an
amazingly
drinkable
beer
this
is
definitely
not
suitable
for
those
recovering
from
surgery
actually
yes
it
is
incredibly
suitable
for
those
recovering
from
surgery
its
over
10
is
disguised
by
waves
of
fruity
decadently
sweet
scents
and
accompanied
alongside
by
candied
citrus
and
chocolate
covered
nuts
if
you
enjoy
barleywines
youll
have
a
tough
time
finding
a
better
example
than
this
trust
me
drinkability
other
than
the
fact
that
i
think
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
more
pronounced
than
it
should
be
this
is
one
hell
of
a
brew
ive
not
had
loads
of
barley
wines
in
my
day
but
in
my
head
this
is
exactly
what
a
american
bw
should
taste
like
loads
of
american
citrus
goodness
with
a
big
hearty
malt
backbone
great
beer
d
while
ive
found
i
cant
drink
that
many
barleywine
beers
in
one
sitting
this
is
a
still
a
good
example
of
one
it
has
an
unusual
for
the
style
flavor
but
is
still
eminently
drinkable
if
you
like
barleywines
this
is
definitely
one
to
try
great
divide
continues
to
impress
overall
i
prefer
old
guardian
shoot
me
very
nice
beer
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
had
loads
of
flavor
and
much
respect
for
the
brewer
i
marked
it
down
on
the
drinkability
because
a
22
oz
bottle
is
like
5
servings
also
you
should
be
a
fan
of
big
big
beers
in
order
to
enjoy
this
one
overall
a
great
barleywine
that
i
would
love
to
enjoy
again
chalk
up
another
winner
for
great
divide
pours
a
deep
amber
maybe
even
cherry
or
burgandy
color
nice
thick
khaki
head
especially
considering
the
alcohol
content
which
produced
a
bunch
of
sticky
lacing
all
over
the
glass
aroma
is
nice
and
hoppy
with
some
citrus
fruits
the
flavor
starts
with
sweet
caramel
malty
notes
after
that
is
the
big
grapefruit
tangy
hoppy
blast
the
aftertaste
is
grapefruit
and
a
bit
winey
considering
the
abv
here
this
is
quite
easy
to
drink
and
smooth
this
is
flat
out
an
excellent
brew
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
i
definitely
recommend
this
i
am
a
pretty
big
fan
of
barleywines
and
this
is
one
of
the
highest
rated
ones
so
i
was
excited
to
try
this
one
of
great
divides
best
for
sure
will
be
buying
more
of
this
soon
honestly
reminded
the
both
of
us
a
lot
of
sierra
nevadas
bigfoot
but
richer
and
more
complex
this
has
great
aging
potential
being
that
the
hops
were
still
very
lively
at
probably
at
least
fourteen
months
old
recommended
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
that
disappeared
quite
quickly
the
smell
was
of
a
very
promising
citrus
pinecaramel
and
hop
nature
from
the
start
you
are
hit
with
the
hop
presents
it
comes
on
strong
and
bitter
then
mellows
nicely
with
the
finish
nice
grapefruit
and
caramel
taste
that
lingers
long
enough
for
the
next
sip
mouth
feel
is
creamy
with
just
the
right
fiz
to
keep
it
interesting
i
have
a
growing
respect
for
the
products
coming
from
the
great
divide
brewing
co
drinkability
felt
this
one
after
a
while
and
it
is
up
there
but
overall
its
a
very
complex
drinkable
brew
with
a
lot
of
really
great
flavors
and
aromas
highly
recommended
this
was
a
very
nice
barleywine
probably
not
as
good
as
bigfoot
for
me
but
quite
solid
drinkability
i
only
got
one
of
these
which
was
a
big
mistake
ill
be
stocking
up
next
time
i
see
this
a
pleasure
to
drink
complex
beyond
belief
but
a
smooth
easy
sipper
a
good
american
barlywine
that
i
enjoy
nothing
outstanding
but
a
well
balanced
beer
something
i
would
recommend
to
lovers
of
the
style
d
if
felt
like
i
had
to
drink
this
beer
fast
because
the
longer
it
sat
the
thicker
it
got
i
swear
if
you
leave
a
bottle
or
glass
of
this
open
over
night
in
the
morning
there
will
be
a
globy
orange
and
brown
beersicle
this
beer
is
huge
also
i
am
really
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
beer
it
fits
the
guidelines
extrodinarily
well
but
there
were
points
where
the
sweetness
and
bitterness
collieded
in
an
unappealing
way
and
closed
with
a
sort
of
odd
bittersweetness
that
didnt
seem
to
fit
into
what
the
rest
of
the
beer
was
doing
other
than
that
this
beer
is
fantastic
each
sip
brings
with
it
a
new
experience
if
you
are
a
fan
of
american
barleywines
this
beer
is
a
must
try
d
this
reminds
me
of
bigfoot
but
i
think
i
like
the
richness
of
that
one
a
bit
more
also
since
this
doesnt
appear
dated
id
prefer
a
year
or
two
on
it
to
soften
the
hops
somewhat
good
no
better
than
that
just
not
outstanding
4
old
ruffian
is
a
wonderful
barleywine
as
usual
this
is
often
overlooked
by
me
at
the
local
since
its
common
to
see
on
the
shelves
solid
says
it
all
real
american
barleywine
this
fresh
bottle
came
unexpectedly
from
a
friend
it
pours
a
clear
darkish
amber
color
with
a
mild
head
it
certainly
looks
inviting
the
aroma
isnt
great
but
its
not
bad
either
i
was
expecting
more
hops
in
the
aroma
which
i
seem
to
remember
from
the
tap
version
but
this
bottle
leans
a
bit
more
toward
the
malty
side
in
the
aroma
the
taste
surprised
me
after
first
experiencing
the
aroma
the
taste
is
malty
but
with
a
nice
blast
of
hop
flavor
and
decent
bitterness
too
nice
this
is
way
too
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
actually
it
got
better
and
better
as
it
warmed
i
think
i
liked
the
draft
version
slightly
better
but
this
is
really
good
too
this
bottle
has
completely
restored
my
faith
in
the
bottled
version
of
this
brew
the
last
bottle
i
had
was
a
total
disappointment
to
be
fair
thinking
back
now
im
sure
that
last
bottle
had
been
aged
which
i
dont
normally
like
in
my
hoppy
americanstyle
brews
in
my
opinion
drink
this
brew
fresh
or
not
at
all
color
is
a
rich
mahogany
brown
nice
and
clear
it
pours
with
a
nice
thick
tan
head
aroma
is
fairly
strong
and
malty
definitely
inviting
flavor
has
a
pretty
fierce
alcohol
bite
but
once
you
get
past
that
it
is
pleasant
smooth
malty
with
caramel
and
fruit
hints
definitely
a
beer
to
be
sipped
and
savored
good
brew
for
the
start
it
up
or
shut
it
down
delicious
a
sipper
no
doubt
d
easy
to
drink
nice
hoppyness
this
is
a
very
delicious
beer
and
exceptionally
well
balanced
hops
and
malt
truely
can
get
along
and
play
nicely
together
d
for
a
barleywine
surprisingly
good
a
sipper
for
sure
but
one
that
is
a
pleasure
to
sip
the
beer
is
all
around
a
solid
barley
wine
a
lot
of
nice
flavours
but
there
could
be
a
bit
more
complexity
i
do
enjoy
how
the
hops
dont
over
power
the
beer
but
just
make
it
nice
and
bitter
after
the
initial
flavours
a
really
drinkable
and
bitter
barleywine
that
rivals
bigfoot
in
the
hops
department
d
sip
pause
ponder
and
savour
pause
repeat
easy
does
it
no
need
to
rush
this
and
why
would
you
want
to
in
my
very
limited
experience
i
find
barleywines
to
be
a
bit
hot
so
i
look
forward
to
holding
on
to
a
second
bottle
i
picked
up
for
quite
some
time
d
even
though
it
would
be
reckless
of
me
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
hops
and
the
alcohol
are
subtle
too
much
of
this
and
i
would
be
calling
in
sick
to
work
drinkability
very
smooth
and
the
hops
clean
the
mouth
in
a
very
soothing
way
i
am
not
a
big
american
style
barleywine
guy
but
this
was
absolutely
delicious
d
only
one
pint
is
enough
for
me
drinkability
is
moderate
alcohol
is
fairly
high
but
flavor
is
good
making
for
easy
but
limited
consumption
overall
a
fantastic
brew
probably
my
favortie
from
great
divide
and
maybe
my
top
barleywine
i
have
had
to
date
remember
im
a
hops
guy
so
this
beer
made
me
happy
nice
job
great
beer
i
will
seek
this
out
and
age
a
few
to
see
how
it
stands
up
to
time
and
i
would
expect
it
will
stand
up
to
time
awesome
poured
from
a
bomber
a
beautiful
mahogany
colored
liquid
emerged
into
the
glass
the
carbonation
was
strong
at
first
with
a
head
at
least
an
inch
and
a
half
thick
the
smell
was
sweet
at
first
with
candied
fruit
and
rasins
followed
by
a
very
floral
hop
aroma
the
flavor
of
this
barleywine
is
intense
sweet
and
fruity
right
off
the
bat
but
finishes
dry
the
mouthfeel
was
amazing
full
bodied
yet
delicate
it
could
be
a
potential
hazard
i
could
drink
this
beer
for
quite
a
while
before
becoming
tired
of
it
a
very
strong
and
very
good
barleywine
hops
compliment
the
sweetness
very
well
a
worthy
price
and
i
will
purchase
again
without
a
second
thought
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
silky
its
a
very
complex
beer
and
quite
tasty
but
i
definitely
would
only
have
one
due
to
its
alcoholic
and
superhoppy
quality
o
m
warm
alcohol
flavor
that
is
nicely
balanced
with
strong
hops
and
malt
medium
to
heavy
mouthfeel
a
great
beer
this
fine
barleywine
has
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
big
foamy
tan
cap
and
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
palatable
thick
with
pine
spruce
and
root
beer
malt
yummy
the
flavor
hits
hard
with
licorice
and
root
beer
alcohol
this
is
pretty
hefty
but
i
can
drink
a
few
its
a
full
bodied
evenly
carbonated
brew
very
smooth
with
a
bit
of
a
double
ipa
flavor
very
nice
poured
into
my
trois
pistoles
goblet
from
a
bomber
bottle
the
brew
pours
cloudy
brown
with
no
head
but
for
a
thin
ring
cloud
at
the
surface
the
nose
is
sweet
from
candi
sugar
but
not
cloying
though
it
really
comes
off
the
glass
as
it
warms
swirl
it
a
bit
and
the
etoh
is
very
evident
hidden
hop
bitterness
grabs
at
the
tongue
with
a
boozy
warming
compoenent
in
the
finish
perfect
brew
for
a
cold
new
england
evening
mouthfeel
consists
of
alcoholish
full
dark
fruit
flavor
interesting
brew
as
it
warms
but
a
one
and
done
recommended
d
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
kicks
ass
if
you
have
not
tried
barleywine
style
ales
you
should
check
this
out
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
despite
the
bottle
itself
being
suspect
this
is
a
big
beerfull
of
flavor
aroma
and
body
if
the
abv
is
accurate
this
is
a
very
deceptive
brew
because
there
is
no
feel
of
alcohol
content
with
the
level
of
hoppiness
this
could
also
be
categorized
as
a
double
triple
ipa
drinkability
excellently
deceptive
barleywine
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
american
style
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
with
small
fingers
worth
of
head
with
some
lacing
and
looked
a
rich
and
dark
copper
color
lightly
toasted
malts
caramel
and
a
hoppy
bready
smell
to
it
sweet
at
first
then
got
lightly
roasted
malts
followed
by
an
intense
hops
bitterness
and
heat
from
the
alcohol
really
coats
the
mouth
with
sticky
syrupy
feeling
and
leaves
a
lingering
aftertaste
nice
beer
but
i
prefer
a
sweeter
bw
with
less
hop
kick
to
it
easily
the
best
barley
wine
in
my
recent
samplings
and
quite
possibly
the
best
one
ive
ever
had
this
is
an
awesome
beer
served
in
aa
snifter
the
beer
was
a
hazy
amber
color
it
had
a
thick
tan
head
with
excellent
retention
and
some
great
lacing
it
had
a
caramel
aroma
with
some
fruit
and
a
little
bit
of
floral
hops
the
taste
followed
the
aroma
and
expanded
on
it
sweet
caramel
to
begin
with
then
the
fruit
and
a
nice
hops
kick
a
wonderful
combination
of
the
sweetness
and
the
hops
ill
drink
this
beer
anytime
anywhere

another
remarkably
tasty
brew
from
great
divide
share
a
bomber
with
a
friend
today
still
outstanding
i
was
excited
to
find
it
on
tap
keep
this
one
in
your
rotation
if
youre
a
into
barleywines
and
b
in
g
d

drinkability
is
high
i
poured
my
first
glass
and
was
quickly
interrupted
taking
a
good
hour
before
i
could
really
get
back
into
it
served
at
cellar
temp
it
only
got
better
as
i
let
it
sit
warm
and
open
up
what
was
at
first
an
annoyance
turned
out
to
be
my
good
fortune
as
its
too
tasty
a
bw
for
me
to
have
otherwise
let
sit
that
long
d
overall
this
is
very
smooth
and
has
aged
nicely
the
alcohol
is
smooth
and
not
abrasive
i
am
really
impressed
with
this
one
great
divide
old
ruffian
barley
wine
style
ale
pours
a
brilliant
orangish
amber
with
a
huge
froathy
multi
inch
head
the
smell
is
moderate
in
strength
of
hops
with
a
mild
fruit
aroma
that
settles
in
the
background
taste
is
huge
on
hops
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
coming
from
a
caramel
like
note
and
then
followed
by
an
ever
so
slight
touch
of
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweet
mouthfeel
is
exceptionally
smooth
with
an
initial
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
this
fades
into
a
lighter
carbonation
feel
at
about
half
glass
overall
drinkability
is
just
fantastic
offering
multiple
great
traits
from
every
aspect
of
this
brew
this
was
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
and
even
with
its
10
2
abv
it
drinks
easier
than
most
3
2
abv
beers
but
with
a
huge
kick
of
course
overall
this
is
a
really
flavorful
cold
weather
or
nightcap
beer
the
taste
was
money
it
was
caramel
sweet
malty
with
a
hoppy
bitter
in
the
end
finish
it
was
a
pretty
complex
profile
in
the
mouth
it
was
spicy
with
a
pepper
to
it
it
lingered
in
the
mouth
for
quite
sometime
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
to
date
very
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
massive
and
robust
and
the
hop
bitterness
is
relentless
id
recommend
cellaring
this
one
for
a
while
alcohol
only
shows
up
both
in
nose
and
on
tongue
towards
the
final
20
of
the
beer
but
its
so
fullbodied
its
one
and
done
per
sitting
for
this
one
its
a
great
version
of
the
style
but
a
bit
too
bitter
for
me
at
least
at
this
age
big
and
bold
this
beer
reminds
me
why
i
became
an
american
craft
beer
fan
it
has
a
take
no
prisoners
flavor
to
hell
with
subtlety
when
you
can
be
brash
common
sense
tells
me
to
sip
this
beer
the
little
guy
on
my
shoulder
tells
me
its
too
good
to
sip
this
poured
into
a
sniffter
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
tannish
head
the
head
stuck
around
for
most
of
the
brew
and
for
a
22
oz
that
was
impressive
great
piney
citrusy
hops
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
bartenders
explination
at
10
2
abv
very
strong
this
is
a
sipping
beer
full
bodied
feel
and
taste
with
an
alcohol
finish
as
american
style
barleywines
are
my
favorite
this
one
ranks
right
up
there
cheers
three
years
has
not
mellowed
this
ruffian
much
and
the
oxidation
is
detracting
in
the
nose
past
prime
really
good
looking
color
and
appearance
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
muddy
looking
given
its
age
but
it
looked
fine
first
sip
reveals
carbonation
is
alive
and
well
and
that
the
flavor
has
resisted
oxidation
second
sip
reveals
that
this
beer
has
aged
nicely
very
nicely
one
of
the
better
vintages
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
big
malt
notes
of
leather
tobacco
chocolate
sugar
its
very
smooth
and
sweet
though
not
cloying
body
is
still
pretty
full
its
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
very
surprised
at
how
well
this
one
held
up
in
the
cellar
will
have
to
do
it
again
this
is
quite
good
very
dry
this
is
one
of
those
drink
allnighters
taste
mouthfeel
sweet
and
rich
caramel
sweetness
is
balanced
by
earthy
bitter
hops
thick
and
oily
on
the
tongue
a
bit
of
heat
appears
in
the
middle
but
its
quickly
replaced
by
a
sharp
resiny
bitterness
this
is
an
nicely
balanced
barleywine
the
sugary
sweetness
never
becomes
cloying
and
the
presence
of
alcohol
never
overwhelms
the
more
subtle
flavors
d
a
slow
slipper
for
special
occasions
22oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
the
aroma
is
absolutely
loaded
with
malt
dark
fruits
caramel
and
hops
the
taste
starts
out
smooth
and
malty
and
the
finish
is
dominated
by
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
that
packs
quite
a
bite
and
hangs
around
long
after
the
sip
is
over
the
predominately
malty
nose
is
deceiving
as
the
taste
packs
quite
a
punch
from
the
hops
overall
this
is
another
solid
american
barleywine
that
does
not
lack
in
flavor
or
character
extreme
beer
at
its
finest
recommended
smell
is
citrusy
and
hoppy
with
great
malty
tones
taste
is
strong
full
of
an
earthy
pineness
that
would
work
well
with
it
citrus
off
dry
fruit
tones
mouth
feel
is
nice
but
a
bit
more
bitter
than
im
use
to
still
a
really
great
brew
really
good
finish
d
strong
and
good
not
a
beer
for
warm
weather
but
one
to
sip
in
front
of
the
fire
after
a
long
day
poured
this
from
a
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
though
i
wasnt
too
concerned
with
this
beast
looks
amazing
bottom
is
an
amber
color
while
the
top
is
straightup
red
very
unusual
head
is
big
and
chunky
and
absolutely
cakes
lacing
on
the
glass
so
that
i
can
see
nothing
through
it
one
sniff
and
i
know
that
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
barleywine
huge
malt
presence
mainly
of
sweet
bread
and
caramel
but
with
a
punch
of
grapefruit
and
pine
magnificent
taste
is
chock
full
of
the
aforementioned
aromas
very
satisfying
but
heavy
mouthfeel
is
thick
without
being
syrupy
good
carbonation
definitely
take
your
time
with
this
one
both
because
alcohol
is
wellhidden
and
because
it
gets
tastier
as
it
warms
a
sight
to
behold
and
enjoy
truly
outstanding
perhaps
it
was
only
this
batch
but
the
hops
seem
to
overpower
and
you
lose
that
complex
finish
that
most
barleywines
provide
see
bigfoot
barleywine
sierra
nevada
maybe
aging
this
one
for
a
year
would
mellow
out
that
overpowering
flavor
and
some
of
the
more
intrinsic
flavors
can
arise
to
greet
the
beer
drinker
this
is
a
delicious
fantastic
beer
but
seems
to
be
a
mahogany
red
ipa
in
disguise
md
full
bodied
but
not
too
heavy
carbonation
is
high
but
the
body
is
really
smooth
and
creamy
drinkability
only
really
hurt
by
the
10
20
this
one
drinks
like
a
dipa
but
with
a
huge

beer
poured

that
did

last

taste
is
of

and
a
load
of
resiny
and
citrus
hops
mouthfeel
is
full
and
very
creamy
one
cannot
ask
for
a
more
satisfying
feel
overall
drinkability
is
quite
nice
despite
the
abv
barleywines
is
not
among
my
favorite
style
style
but
there
is
something
about
this
beer
that
makes
it
quite
quaffable
i
would
recommend
this
to
try
i
suppose
it
couldve
aged
longer
as
theres
an
unsubtle
thread
of
alcoholic
warmth
running
through
but
no
matter
its
a
friggin
barleywine
it
can
handle
the
heat
and
i
can
handle
the
whole
bottle
slowly
thanks

from
bottle
king
in
parsipany
as
someone
who
is
not
even
a
particularly
big
fan
of
barleywines
i
was
absolutely
blown
away
by
this
beer
an
amazing
selection
from
great
divide
in
fact
every
beer
ive
tried
from
this
company
so
far
has
been
topnotch
their
old
ruffian
is
probably
the
finest
depiction
of
the
style
that
i
have
yet
sampled
tastes
very
similar
to
an
imperial
ipa
but
with
added
rich
malts
and
caramel
sweetness
a
very
interesting
intricate
blend
of
hops
and
malts
make
this
a
unique
onehell
of
a
big
beer
very
nice
mahoganybrown
rubyred
appearance
leads
to
a
modest
frothy
and
foamy
head
which
lingered
on
for
a
bit
and
left
quite
a
bit
of
lasting
smell
was
outstanding
ultrarich
sweet
dominated
by
a
smooth
blend
of
hops
and
malts
caramel
and
brown
sugars
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
would
be
to
label
it
as
a
sweet
ipa
there
is
enough
bitterness
evident
from
the
hops
and
the
almost
90
ibus
to
feel
it
yet
there
is
also
a
nice
dichotomy
of
malts
and
caramel
sweetness
to
nicely
balance
this
out
and
make
it
a
very
unique
and
interesting
sample
creamy
rich
thick
mouthfeel
with
a
good
level
of
drinkability
the
10
2
abv
will
soon
creep
up
on
you
great
stuff
definitely
recommended
its
only
downside
may
be
its
profound
strength
which
juxtaposes
its
summery
flavors
its
definitely
a
beer
to
drink
in
moderation
despite
its
poundability
mmm
this
is
a
real
nice
barleywine
from
great
divide
drink
em
if
you
got
em
first
review
for
me
lurking
for
a
long
time
though
d
this
is
the
first
barley
wine
that
ive
had
and
i
must
say
that
this
sets
the
bar
pretty
high
for
the
next
one
i
get
in
my
limited
opinion
on
the
style
this
is
worth
trying
sometime
deep

applecider

unfiltered
look
thin
light

but
the
stuff
still
looks
very
appetizing
strong
caramelalcoholic
aroma
with
nice
hint
of

hops
come
out
in
spades
on
the
mouth
very
nice
bitterness
blends
nicely
with
alcoholic
malt
and
sweetness
powerful

finish
drinks
like
a

sundae
with

syrup
warm
and
soothing
good
to
drink
very
slowly
to
savor
it
all
great
stuff
between
this
and
the
oak
yeti
i
am
in
awe
of
great
divide
two
of
the
best
that
i
have
ever
had
my
hats
off
to
you
guys
this
ale
is
a
crystal
clear
reddish
brown
in
color
the
head
is
light
tan
in
appearance
and
medium
in
size
from
a
vigorous
pour
there
is
tons
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
as
you
drink
the
beer
the
smell
is
of
vanilla
brown
sugar
and
dough
the
taste
is
very
malty
sweetness
of
sugar
biscuity
and
smooth
with
just
a
slight
earthy
character
from
the
hops
the
bitterness
levels
match
up
quite
well
with
the
sweetness
leaving
a
very
well
rounded
taste
mouthfeel
is
thick
carbonation
is
smooth
and
light
very
drinkable
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
it
isnt
hard
to
drink
the
entire
22oz
bomber
by
ones
self
great
divide
has
another
great
ale
here
aroma
is
heavy
pine
and
grapefruit
hops
with
light
caramel
malts
and
a
touch
of
doughy
yeast
pour
yields
a
medium
amber
colored
brew
with
a
largish
creamy
offwhite
head
that
retains
well
and
has
pretty
good
lacing
flavor
is
heavy
hops
bitter
and
salty
on
the
finish
a
bit
over
carbonate
i
would
not
want
to
drink
too
much
of
this
stuff
as
it
is
extremely
hoppy
but
it
is
still
a
decent
brew
d
more
of
a
iipa
or
dipa
easy
to
drink
for
a
barley
wine
sad
i
avoided
this
barley
wine
ill
have
another
very
smooth
on
the
palate
just
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
but
its
a
very
good
beer
to
sip
big
beer
for
sure
theres
enough
carbonation
to
keep
this
one
from
being
too
syrupy
yet
its
still
creamy
im
not
really
a
big
fan
of
barley
wines
this
one
is
actually
quite
tasty
but
its
still
a
little
hard
for
me
to
drink
a
whole
bomber
by
myself
not
to
be
missed
d
very
drinkable
until
you
finish
and
alcohol
hits
you
some
alcohol
bite
upon
warming
d
damn
good
considering
the
raggedyassed
alcohol
burn
this
one
is
definitely
made
for
sharing
and
sipping
but
what
a
great
beer
to
share
and
sip
incredibly
balanced
and
well
done
highly
recommended
for
english
and
american
fans
of
the
style
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
but
dont
have
a
death
wish
one
bomber
or
better
yet
a
half
a
bomber
sipped
over
the
course
of
an
evening
is
perfect
for
me
to
get
my
old
ruffian
fix
for
a
month
or
two

up
at

store
in

a
very

some

s
lots
of
dark

toasted
malts
caramel
toffee
earthy
hops
t
like
the
bottle
says
its
got
a
wonderful
fruity
sweet
character
up
front
which
is
followed
closely
behind
by
a
blast
of
hoppy
earthy
bitterness
pine
and
citrus
notes
toward
the
very
long
finish
m
thick
moderate

d
ive
seen
this
one
for
a
while
now
but
have
never
picked
it
upbut
i
suspect
ill
be
buying
it
much
more
often
now
terrific
balance
for
such
a
huge
beer
both
in
terms
of
its
malty
sweetness
and
its
hoppy
bitterness
huge
abv
well
hidden
really
fantastic
drinkability
this
one
will
kick
your
butt
good
solid
barleywine
its
not
so
much
in
your
face
as
it
is
just
really
good
bigfoot
is
still
my
favorite
but
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
best
that
ive
ever
had
if
i
could
get
this
one
here
it
would
be
a
barleywine
staple
along
with
bigfoot

recommended

thanks
dan
there
are
no
markings
or
dates
on
the
bottle
dan
told
me
that
it
is
a
2005
though
when
poured
into
my
spaten
beer
mug
it
has
a
a
huge
2
finger
head
the
head
had
the
smallest
bubbles
and
it
look
like
vanillla

cream
dark
ruby
brown
color
is
very
inviting
the
head
has
reduced
and
there
is
nice
lacing
with
the
head
no
at
one
finger
the
smell
is
of
raisins
dates
and
figs
it
is
sweet
tasting
but
slick
too

through
this

and
the

also
dark

and
pine
notes
taste
is
a
wonderful
balance
between
the
big
malts
and
hop
bitterness
just
barely
a
hint
of
warming
alcohol
at
the
end
went
down
way
too
easy
for
a

mouthfeel
was

and
unctuous
with
just
enough
carbonation
good
fucking
shit
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
barleywines
ive
had
ruby
red
in
appearance
with
some
very
sticky

smell
is
of
sweet

citrus
tastes
of
tangy

grapefruit
pine
sweet
carmel
malt
and
booze
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
harsh
mouth
feel
is
creamy
and
slightly
sticky
overall
drinkability
is
good
the
hops
were
juicy
and
the
alcohol
was
warming
to
make
this
one
a
slow
sipper
recommended
old
ruffian
barleywine
pours
a
clear
deep
copper
red
with
beautiful
lacing
that
follows
the
beer
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
rich
with
sweet
caramel
malts
and
tons
of
dark
fruity
esters
there
is
a
bit
of
citrusy
hops
and
bitterness
the
first
flavor
that
hits
my
tongue
is
a
preview
of
citrusy
grapefruity
hops
followed
by
rich
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
malt
the
huge
sweetness
is
balanced
by
a
rounded
bitterness
and
more
grapefruit
hops
the
bitterness
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
and
almost
completely
hides
the
alcohol
this
has
to
be
the
easiest
drinking
barleywine
ive
had
its
really
smooth
and
delicious
appearance
is
a
nice
amber
with
a
nice
head
that
lingers
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
great
sweet
and
syrupy
with
some
floral
smells
included
the
taste
is
initially
syrupy
sweet
with
a
burn
that
lingers
there
are
some
toasted
and
coffee
flavors
as
well
as
a
fair
amount
of
hoppy
brightness
the
initial
tastes
wane
to
reveal
the
alchohol
which
is
significant
at

abv
this
is
a
very
nice
barleywine
something
great
for
a
celebration
or
a
cold
night
but
not
something
i
would
drink
all
the
time
drinkability
is
limited
while
this
is
a
delicious
beer
after
one
bottle
i
would
be
ready
to
move
to
something
lighter
or
quit
drinking
for
the
night
nice
brown
body
with
a
rather
long
lasting
head
for
a
big
beer
aroma
has
a
lot
of
sweetness
complemented
by
a
lot
of
pine
flavor
is
strong
on
fresh
malt
notes
but
the
resinous
pine
dominates
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
luxurious
perhaps
just
a
bit
too
fatiguing
towards
the
end
of
the
bottle
after
a
bad
first
impression
a
several
years
ago
with
great
divide
ive
since
been
very
pleased
with
all
their
offerings
this
one
is
no
exception
d
well
balanced
with
well
hidden
abv
first
off
this
one
pours
beautifully
i
think
a
robust
and
slightly
cloudy
red
with
a
strong
hint
of
brown
two
finger
head
smell
is
powerfully
sweet
my
first
taste
was
so
thick
with
alcohol
that
i
thought
i
was
heading
for
a
major
disappointment
but
after
that
initial
draw
the
alcohol
seemed
less
in
your
face
err
mouth
though
it
was
still
strong
through
the
remainder
this
is
a
proper
american
barleywine
its
up
there
on
my
list
of
favorites
with
sn
bigfoot
love
this
beer
highly
recommended
poured
copper
smallish
head
but
it
stuck
around
for
quite
a
while
the
smell
really
blew
me
away
when
i
opened
the
bottle
it
was
just
gushing
with
fruity
hops
taste
is
full
of
those
two
with
plenty
of
toasty
malt
hops
definitely
prevail
though
sharp
taste
of
alcohol
that
lingers
with
the
hops
long
after
the
sip
has
ended
a
tad
caramel
maybe
some
raisens
too
this
one
hits
the
belly
like
a
bomb
so
i
dont
know
how
many
i
could
drink
tasty
as
it
is
a
year
would
definitely
do
this
brew
some
good
to
relax
the
alcohol
im
still
kind
of
skeptical
about
aging
hoppy
beers
because
i
dont
want
to
lose
any
of
the
hop
flavor
but
this
one
has
more
than
enough
to
compensate
if
you
have
this
one
id
recommend
laying
it
down
for
a
year
as
difficult
as
it
may
be
old
ruffian
reminds
me
a
lot
of
great
divides
dipa
except
with
a
bigger
malt
backbone
and
a
much
more
prominent
alcohol
taste
it
rivals
bigfoot
and
hair
of
the
dogs
fred
as
one
of
the
best
hoppy
barleywines
you
wont
be
disappointed
especially
with
age
this
will
be
a
cellaring
beer
for
me
will
rereview
in
24
months
a
very
good
barleywine
and
excellent
example
of
the
american
version
of
the
style
looks
much
like
sockeye
red
and
the
nose
to
match
im
100
expecting
an
ipa
flowery
mildly
hoppy
taste
with
a
good
bite
on
the
finish
and
a
crisp
mouthfeel
this
is
also
very
downable
hops
and
that
is
not
to
say
i
dont
greatly
enjoy
this
beer
i
will
age
my
next
one
for
a
bit
longer
all
in
all
i
am
very
satisfied
with
this
brew
and
will
return
to
the
style
but
this
barley
wine
doesnt
stand
up
to
bigfoot
in
my
mind
i
just
dont
find
the
taste
or
aroma
here
as
complex
and
engaging
theres
some
very
nice

is

less

the
heavy
citrus
taste
associated
with

a

blown

is
mild
with

toasted

aroma
is
grassy
hops
and
sweet
one
of
my
favorite
american
style
barleywines
a
very
good
beer
fresh
and
i
bought
some
to
age
i
think
with
a
little
more
refinement
of
the
hops
this
will
be
even
better
right
now
its
on
the
hoppy
end
of
where
i
like
a
barleywine
22oz
bomber
poured
a
crystal
clear
copper
color
with
ruby
highlights
a
large
tan
head
formed
somewhat
surprising
given
abv
aroma
was
caramel
and
fruits
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
grapefruit
some
yeastbread
and
alcohol
first
sip
and
bang
the
hops
come
out
of
hiding
citrus
primarily
grapefruit
this
is
nicely
balanced
by
sweet
malt
which
came
aross
to
me
as
maple
syrup
melon
and
other
hard
to
specify
fruit
flavors
the
alcohol
comes
through
fairly
strongly
but
this
works
well
to
moderate
both
the
sweetness
and
the
bitterness
this
is
a
fairly
heavy
beer
with
light
carbonation
a
drying
sensation
and
plenty
of
alcohol
warming
this
was
excellent
easily
the
best
barley
wine
i
have
had
and
although
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
to
date
my
guess
is
that
some
age
would
treat
this
well
and
that
it
would
pair
nicely
with
some
sharp
cheddar
mouthfeel
is
fine
for
a
barleywine
pours
a
slightly
translucent
brown
color
with
moderate
head
smell
is
of
slight
hops
and
very
little
else
taste
is
huge
the
whole
mouthfeel
is
dominating
and
wonderful
most
of
the
taste
is
an
enormous
mixture
of
hops
and
malts
there
is
also
a
wonderful
hop
aftertaste
one
of
the
best
barley
wines
ive
had
i
am
really
impressed
by
this
brewery
they
need
to
get
distribution
on
the
east
coast
i
got
this
from
liquid
solutions
highly
drinkable
although
youll
feel
it
pours
a
thick
and
slightly
hazy
amber
with
a
head
that
is
thin
but
doesnt
plan
on
leaving
anytime
soon
a
delicious
aroma
of
powerful
citrusy
fruits
mixed
with
some
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
but
for
only
a
brief
moment
before
blasting
you
with
bitter
hops
that
will
stay
with
you
for
quite
some
time
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
thick
chewy
syrupy
andincredibly
smooth
a
beer
meant
for
sipping
and
not
neccessarily
in
huge
quantities
ill
be
getting
another
to
age
this
tasted
like
a
young
barley
wine
but
i
did
by
another
bottle
for
aging
and
will
review
when
i
have
aged
one
rich
and
robust
thick
and
chewy
the
abv
hides
behind
the
bushes
ready
to
pull
you
down
if
one
partakes
a
little
to
fast
i
did
get
this
last
year
so
the
year
of
aging
could
have
really
helped
gotta
get
a
few
more
bombers
this
year
silky
smooth
and
intensely
sweet
at
first
with
ripe
plum
and
fig
flavors
followed
by
just
a
hint
of
smoke
and
then
an
intense
pine
presence
finish
is
viscous
and
chewy
with
notes
of
ginger
snap
cookies
very
complex
and
highly
drinkable
with
the
alcohol
only
appearing
at
the
end
one
of
if
not
the
best
barley
wines
ive
ever
had
the
is
a
stellar
barleywine
its
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
tasted
so
well
balanced
yet
so
hoppy
a
rich
amalgamation
of
intense
flavors
if
you
dont
try
this
your
life
is
incomplete
ah
ha
ha
after
the
dipa
that
i
mistook
for
a
bw
this
is
more
like
it
looks
like
a
bw
maybe
a
bit
high
on
the
head
but
its
a
nice
dark
tan
with
tight
little
bubbles
good
lasting
power
there
sure
it
smells
like
hops
but
it
smells
like
bw
hops
none
of
that
fruity
citrusy
stuff
here
ah
and
it
tastes
like
a
bw
rich
sweet
caramel
malt
complexity
bitter
nice
and
thick
oh
yeah
its
a
good
thing
winter
is
here
again
and
we
can
go
back
to
drinking
the
heavy
stuff
day
in
and
day
out
and
hmm
really
a
nice
head
on
that
its
still
there
5
minutes
later
year
way
more
like
a
bw
man
i
just
love
these
guys
its
always
about
making
great
beers
like
this
one
somewhere
in
there
its
about
having
a
good
balance
of
ingredients
yes
this
is
very
sweet
and
very
full
bodied
but
the
bitterness
is
balanced
with
that
just
so
its
the
case
with
all
of
their
brews
great
balance
what
a
talent
they
should
be
giving
classes
to
other
brewers
on
restraint
on
blending
things
just
so
last
thoughts
this
is
an
outrageous
take
on
a
barleywine
and
one
that
will
leave
a
long
lasting
impression
i
especially
enjoyed
the
consistant
hopiness
which
continued
throughout
every
sip
it
doesnt
necessarily
represent
the
average
runofthemill
barleywine
but
instead
takes
it
up
a
notch
this
is
one
incredible
beer
and
one
that
everyone
should
try
very
easy
to
drink
i
am
going
to
try
aging
the
second
bottle
that
i
have
for
a
few
months
to
see
if
it
gets
even
better
very
impressed
with
this
brew
it
definitely
lived
up
to
its
billing
another
wonderful
beer
from
the
folks
at
gd
my
favorite
american
barleywine
to
date
pours
hazy
reddish
brown
with
a
tan
head
it
retains
the
head
really
well
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
in
this
one
aroma
is
citrusy
hops
fruits
tons
of
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
taste
is
dominated
by
the
hops
and
the
alcohol
and
unfortunatly
the
malts
and
a
lot
of
the
complexity
are
overshadowed
by
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
viscous
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
i
dont
really
understand
why
it
is
rated
so
high
at
almost
6
for
a
bottle
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
but
i
dont
regret
trying
it
might
be
good
to
split
the
22
oz
bottle
with
someone
bottle
courtesy
of
daalamar
poured
a
burgundy
color
ale
with
a
small
offwhite
foamy
head
with
average
retention
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
with
some
noticeable
bitter
hops
taste
is
a
well
enough
balanced
mix
between
sweet
caramel
malt
and
bitter
hops
body
is
above
average
but
could
have
been
more
full
and
alcohol
was
well
hidden
which
is
great
overall
this
was
quite
enjoyable
and
would
love
to
have
more
in
order
to
aged
some
of
it
well
be
drinking
this
again
thanks
to
beeradvocate
reviewers
for
recommending
this
beer
i
could
drink
mabey
a
couple
of
bottles
but
would
be
too
intoxicated
to
even
attempt
opening
the
third
a
huge
and
most
excellent
barleywine
great
barley
wine
drinkabilityoverall
really
disappointed
in
the
harshness
of
the
hopping
and
booze
in
this
one
im
all
for
a
hop
bomb
but
this
seems
more
of
a
hops
and
vodka
tonic
than
a
beer
brewed
with
malt
this
was
frankly
a
little
hard
to
finish
not
a
drain
pour
but
more
work
than
drinking
a
beer
should
be
hard
to
see
how
this
is
rated
so
much
higher
than
works
of
complexity
and
balance
like
old
foghorn
or
old
crustacean
drinkability
while
this
is
no
doubt
a
winner
with
hopheads
i
reacted
to
this
beer
the
way
my
cats
react
to
having
medicine
pushed
down
their
throat
when
compared
to
masterfully
hopped
american
barleywines
like
old
crustacean
or
even
more
balanced
efforts
like
bigfoot
this
beer
seems
excessively
onedimensional
i
acknowledge
that
this
was
probably
their
aim
and
gave
this
a
3
for
taste
rather
than
a
lower
mark
i
adjusted
drinkability
to
reflect
my
assessment
of
this
beer
against
the
style
nearly
no
malt
or
fruit
developments
in
this
one
and
the
heady
and
thick
quality
of
other
barleywines
is
altogether
lacking
one
for
the
hopheads
though
more
like
a
double
ipa
than
a
barleywine
deep
redish
amber
in
color
not
quite
see
through
giant
sticky
oily
toffee
colored
head
that
left
great
chunky
lacing
the
whole
way
down
rich
toasty
malt
aroma
with
some
sweet
fruity
notes
and
a
bit
of
a
perfumey
hops
smell
the
taste
is
initially
of
rich
syrupy
malt
but
that
give
way
almost
immediately
to
a
fruity
dry
apple
cider
flavor
then
a
strong
but
balanced
floral
and
a
bit
resinous
hop
flavor
the
malt
shines
bright
in
the
finish
deep
malt
flavor
not
bitter
roasted
but
chocolaty
and
fruity
plum
and
dark
cherry
good
sticky
mouthfeel
but
tart
enough
from
the
hops
alcohol
is
hidden
fairly
well
drinkable
for
a
barley
wine
this
beer
deserves
its
great
reputation
old
ruffian
barley
wine
pours
a
hazy
dark
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twenty
two
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
outstanding
i
get
fruit
malt
and
hops
in
the
nose
taste
is
equally
good
really
nice
malt
flavors
caramel
toffee
fruit
and
good
hop
bite
in
the
finish
to
balance
it
out
if
you
like
american
style
barley
wine
you
should
absolutely
be
hoarding
this
beer
highly
recommended
i
had
this
with
some
veal
cutlets
id
simmered
in
another
dark
ale
with
garlic
pepper
paprika
and
a
lil
dash
of
curry
it
complimented
the
meal
nicely
drinkability
this
is
very
good
and
it
goes
down
very
easy
the
high
abv
is
very
well
hidden
i
should
lower
drinkability
because
its
high
abv
should
limit
sessionability
but
im
not
going
to
so
one
should
go
ahead
and
have
the
next
serving
a
22
oz
bomber
that
is
but
exercise
all
due
caution
no
driving
not
if
you
have
to
go
to
work
early
etc
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
the
americn
barleywine
style
more
of
a
fan
of
the
english
interpretations
but
since
this
was
rated
so
highly
i
felt
compelled
to
pick
up
a
bomber
anyway
it
pours
a
beautiful
orangered
color
very
tropical
looking
great
heading
in
there
also
smell
is
very
sweet
with
plenty
of
malty
sugar
some
chocolate
and
plenty
of
fruit
ranging
from
dark
to
light
it
is
a
very
juicy
smell
but
above
all
the
alcohol
permeates
to
make
the
drinker
know
that
this
beer
is
not
messing
around
definetly
strong
taste
was
ful
of
complexities
with
molasses
candy
sungar
medicinal
flavors
more
fruit
and
a
bitterness
that
shows
up
right
at
the
end
it
is
certainly
a
heavy
bodied
beer
for
the
style
which
makes
it
a
beer
that
seems
to
be
meant
for
sipping
and
savoring
with
regard
to
drinkability
althoigh
i
really
appreciate
this
beer
i
found
myself
struggling
to
finish
with
the
heavy
alcohol
and
aggressive
hops
perhaps
cause
it
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
there
is
a
reason
that
they
call
this
beer
the
ruffian
and
that
is
because
it
is
just
that
a
beer
that
will
warm
you
make
you
cringe
and
in
the
end
give
you
one
hell
of
a
buzz
im
very
glad
that
i
got
this
beer
certainly
one
that
widens
horizens
with
how
a
beer
should
taste
in
the
end
i
reccomend
it
it
seems
like
a
beer
that
would
be
nice
on
its
own
but
even
better
with
some
kind
of
rich
dessert
more
aging
might
cure
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
factors
by
mellowing
out
the
extreme
alcohol
aftertaste
id
probably
give
it
a
lower
score
on
drinkability
if
it
werent
for
the
amazing
tastes
that
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
pours
very
dark
copper
to
ruddy
in
color
with
a
tight
tan
head
aroma
is
big
strongest
smell
is
the
hops
a
citrusy
sweetness
a
little
on
the
vitamin
c
orange
smarty
side
some
pineyness
in
the
background
of
the
hop
smell
as
well
behind
the
hops
are
the
rich
sugary
caramel
and
malt
aromas
the
citrus
hops
keep
it
refreshing
and
finish
with
a
pine
bitterness
all
the
while
the
malt
sweetness
is
there
in
the
back
balancing
the
hops
and
adding
to
the
richness
and
the
mouthfeel
good
size
body
a
little
slickness
but
mainly
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
little
bite
at
the
end
from
the
alcohol
and
a
slight
drying
from
the
hops
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
highly
enjoyed
pretty
good
drinkability
but
this
is
decidedly
a
big
and
hoppy
beer
a
good
sipping
beer
but
this
is
decidedly
a
connoisseur
beer
that
would
turn
off
your
average
nonenthusiast
beer
chugger
a
very
hop
forward
barleywine
and
a
little
heavy
with
the
darker
malts
but
a
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
none
the
less
d
for
the
style
this
is
right
on
key
there
isnt
tomany
ways
if
any
to
improve
this
d
this
is
a
dipa
with
some
alcohol
and
sweet
malt
in
the
background
i
like
to
see
more
complexity
of
malt
flavors
in
barley
wines
regardless
of
how
big
the
hops
are
i
dont
think
this
would
age
well
because
once
the
hops
settle
down
there
isnt
much
complexity
in
the
malt
to
shine
but
only
time
will
tell
drinkability
i
find
this
harder
to
down
than
most
barleywines
it
is
very
intense
in
both
malts
and
hops
but
unlike
other
brews
they
dont
seem
to
balance
another
impressive
offering
from
great
divide
this
one
dances
around
the
fringes
of
the
perfect
beer
for
me
the
ruby
redmahogany
color
with
the
frothy
tanbeige
head
is
very
appealing
the
translucent
color
when
held
up
to
light
lets
you
see
some
small
bubbles
rising
to
the
surface
the
smell
is
pronounced
at
a
cool
temp
and
unlocks
even
more
as
the
beer
warms
a
very
malty
base
covers
up
much
of
the
hop
aroma
a
toasty
molasses
sweet
raisen
and
plum
mixture
fills
the
boquet
the
taste
is
very
nice
the
malty
base
is
well
represented
up
front
that
nice
dark
fruit
flavor
shines
through
a
nice
middle
points
to
some
almost
faint
grassy
notes
and
then
you
are
hit
with
a
semidry
and
bold
hop
finish
the
finish
is
impecible
the
alchohol
in
this
one
is
completely
masked
untill
it
warms
you
all
the
way
down
the
mouhfeel
on
this
one
is
impecible
perfect
in
my
mind
very
smooth
and
creamy
unbelievably
balanced
my
example
of
how
beers
should
feel
on
the
cheek
ultimately
a
very
very
good
beer
drinkable
through
and
through
do
these
guys
make
anything
that
isnt
great
awesome
amber
red
color
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
nice
ring
around
the
glass
and
good
lacing
caramel
plum
floral
and
piney
hops
in
the
smell
taste
loads
you
up
with
caramel
and
dark
fruit
and
then
then
the
hops
kick
in
and
take
charge
with
flavors
of
pineaple
and
maybe
even
orange
hidden
in
there
as
well
finishes
with
a
taste
of
pine
full
body
seems
to
be
perfect
carbonation
im
glad
to
drink
this
one
this
bottle
was
still
young
so
some
of
the
flavors
were
separated
i
have
a
bottle
im
saving
to
try
after
the
flavors
start
to
blend
d
really
this
was
just
too
much
too
much
alcohol
too
much
bitterness
too
heavy
its
really
just
over
the
top
the
name
tags
this
beer
pretty
well
becaus
it
is
quite
rough
it
should
be
old
roughian
d
every
sip
just
adds
to
the
flavor
ibus
are
low
enough
for
near
universal
appeal
yet
hopheads
will
be
in
love
i
want
another
md
so
after
a
22oz
bomber
of
this
you
really
dont
need
to
drink
anymore
but
with
that
in
consideration
this
beer
was
wonderful
to
sit
and
sip
on
i
enjoyed
every
sip
moderate
carbonation
mediumheavy
body
and
delicious
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
reddish
amber
color
with
a
small
light
tan
head
aroma
was
of
malt
and
spicy
hops
taste
was
very
malty
caramelly
and
fruity
with
a
nice
bitter
hop
kick
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
rich
and
full
bodied
drinkability
is
good
considering
the
strength
of
this
beer
i
can
imagine
that
a
bottle
of
this
could
be
aged
for
several
years
and
still
be
quite
good
20707
bottle
cellared

probably
purchased
in

great
color
light
head
tastes
and
smells
great
with
the
fruity
malts
shining
through
now
that
the
hops
have
been
tempered
with
age
i
enjoy
the
dry
earthy
grain
note
that
accompanies
the
malt
sweetness
smooth
medium
carbonation
with
a
full

not
a

overall
pretty

like
an
ipaquite
hopsybitter
a
bit
too
bitter
for
my
tastes
strong
bitterness
but
hop
flavor
is
subdued
to
let
the
malt
shine
its
big
and
complex
but
still
maintains
some
balance
a
great
barley
wine
way
too
easy
to
finish
an
entire
bomber
recommended
anyway
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
hazy
brew
lucious
head
stays
around
way
too
long
aromas
are
like
candy
sweet
fruity
deep
and
malty
with
some
floral
grassy
hops
bringing
up
the
backbone
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
slick
this
tastes
like
a
fine
wine
with
complexity
spice
bitter
hops
slightly
less
so
than
bigfoot
and
tons
of
alcohol
to
boot
ahh
the
warming
is
seeping
in
already
sweetness
and
hops
are
in
perfect
harmony
on
this
one
as
they
both
hit
a
high
right
at
the
end
before
the
spicy
alcohol
gets
you
carbonation
is
minimal
and
just
right
for
style
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
cheese
nearly
any
kind
of
blue
would
be
perfect
with
some
pears
and
honey
to
go
with
it
im
glad
i
can
find
these
bombers
so
far
regularly
unlike
other
only
seasonal
barleywines
definitely
a
treat
this
is
an
unusual
and
interesting
brew
very
complex
and
enjoyable
i
will
definitely
seek
this
one
out
again
overall
an
enjoyable
experience
will
definitly
be
having
more
of
these
in
the
future
d
i
dont
find
this
to
be
an
easy
thing
to
drink
not
that
its
bad
or
anything
its
just
not
really
appealing
to
my
taste
so
we
shall
see
what
happens
with
this
bottle
and
what
other
barley
wines
i
buy
next
pours
a
nice
mahogany
brown
with
a
creamy
offyellow
head
of
12
inch
nice
lacing
semicloudiness
aroma
of
strong
grassy
hops
and
mild
caramel
malt
strong
alcohol
in
the
nose
flavor
is
a
mix
of
caramel
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
malt
balanced
with
strong
hoppy
bitterness
the
alcohol
becomes
quite
effervescent
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
with
decent
subtle
carbonation
drinkablility
seemed
quite
nice
for
a
strong
alcohol
brew
i
enjoyed
it
alot
about
the
time
jack
decided
the
solution
to
his
boredom
could
be
solved
via
axe
i
was
polishing
off
this
remarkable
beer
and
wishing
i
had
a
bit
more
i
have
no
problem
proclaiming
this
the
best
barleywine
ive
tasted
and
certainly
hope
to
taste
it
again
pours
dark
brown
with
reddish
tint
nice
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fades
the
aroma
is
caramel
prunes
and
citrus
the
flavor
is
very
big
with
lots
of
sweet
malt
caramel
toffee
and
dark
fruit
and
lots
of
good
hops
pine
and
grapefruit
body
is
big
and
chewy
overall
a
great
beer
and
worthy
of
its
many
accolades
never
thought
id
be
saying
that
about
something
with
90
ibus
but
the
bitterness
is
so
balanced
by
the
malt
sweetness
that
its
really
fine
and
complex
poured
into
a
22oz
mug
a
deep
amber
color
that
is
slightly
cloudy
with
a
14
inch
head
that
laces
down
the
mug
slowly
down
the
glass
the
aroma
comes
with
a
floral
and
earthy
onslaught
that
is
evident
at
a
distance
as
you
get
closer
to
the
glass
the
malt
becomes
more
pronounced
the
taste
is
excellent
starting
with
the
sweet
malt
at
the
beginning
and
the
midway
the
hops
begin
come
forward
and
it
gets
stronger
as
it
reaches
the
end
of
every
taste
in
the
mouth
it
be
classified
like
a
lightheavy
weight
in
boxing
heavy
but
not
overly
heavy
it
alao
seems
to
be
chewy
towards
the
end
you
have
to
drink
this
one
slowly
the
intense
flavor
and
high
alchol
means
this
beer
could
knock
you
on
your
butt
beautiful
rusty
red
with
a
golden
halo
around
it
poured
from
a
bottle
which
had
been
cellared
for
nearly
9
months
delectable
dollup
of
beige
cream
on
top
wildly
hoppy
even
when
cold
the
hops
intensify
greatly
as
it
warms
body
is
full
syrupy
the
viscosity
is
simply
mindblowing
fullthats
an
understatement
this
beer
is
bloody
explosive
nose
is
diesel
fuel
citrus
fruit
mountain
holly
juniper
sweet
bread
mango
taste
is
brown
sugar
jam
rye
bread
cinnamon
mango
earth
pineapple
and
much
much
more
how
much
more
well
there
are
chocolates
melons
dates
grapefruit
figs
and
caramels
a
plenty
the
whole
deal
is
great
tremendous
depthful
balanced
better
than
most
if
not
all
of
the
competitor
and
ever
so
complex
strong
and
numbing
as
the
alcohol
is
the
hops
just
kick
starts
your
face
back
into
believing
that
you
could
just
drink
and
drink
this
brew
all
day
minimal
carbonation
as
expected
filling
mf
rich
and
creamy
drinkability
is
crazy
good
this
stuff
is
10
yet
i
could
guzzle
it
if
i
wished
a
damn
near
perfect
representation
of
the
style
beefy
mouthfeel
really
lathers
up
the
palate
superbly
drinkable
as
there
is
not
one
thing
out
of
whack
with
this
more
expressive
as
it
warmed
makes
it
even
better
excellent
beer
delicious
overall
this
one
is
oh
so
good
very
heavy
on
the
hops
but
still
very
very
drinkable
could
be
the
age
wearing
on
the
hops
i
love
the
amount
of
malt
flavor
i
get
in
this
it
doesnt
rip
my
tongue
clean
of
tastebuds
after
drinking
like
others
in
its
style
so
complex
simply
great
this
beer
looks
fabulous
in
the
glass
the
perfect
amber
color
is
topped
by
a
creamy
lusciouslooking
head
that
extends
just
above
the
lip
of
my
glass
it
smells
bready
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
hops
the
taste
is
very
well
balance
it
is
hoppy
but
in
a
balanced
way
as
opposed
to
a
kickinthemouth
type
of
way
it
starts
and
finishes
smooth
is
a
joy
to
drink
and
is
one
of
the
very
best
american
barleywines
i
have
tried
great
welldone
impressive
as
far
as
having
it
often
well
i
would
still
prefer
their
ipa
this
is
damn
smooth
but
the
flavor
profile
leaves
me
slightly
annoyed
i
can
respect
it
and
i
bet
it
is
exactly
what
they
wanted
but
it
isnt
my
favorite
the
big
caramel
and
date
malt
along
with
the
piney
citrus
hops
continues
to
not
work
on
my
palate
no
matter
the
company
probably
will
not
have
this
often
i
still
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
so
cheers
to
great
divide
d
medium
great
bodied
nice
flavor
needs
a
bit
more
balance
drinkability
about
right
for
the
style
what
an
enormous
frothy
head
with
terrific
lacing
not
much
more
you
can
ask
for
in
this
department
nose
is
what
you
would
expect
of
a
barley
wine
hoppy
caramel
with
fruity
barley
very
smooth
but
with
decent
hop
character
very
bold
in
your
face
type
beer
not
one
of
my
favorite
barley
wines
but
would
definitely
drink
one
again
very
soon
if
possible
begs
the
question
does
bigfoot
live
near
the
mountains
on
the
label
they
seem
to
be
cut
from
the
same
centennial
hops
insanely
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
loved
it
the
best
of
the
great
divide
beers
that
have
come
into
maryland
recently
imo
my
main
gripe
is
the
label
on
the
bottle
gds
bottle
labels
are
too
bland
to
do
their
beers
justice
i
wish
theyd
jazz
or
punk
rock
things
up
a
bit
with
their
bottle
art
other
than
that
another
high
abv
beer
with
a
strong
hoppy
character
that
nevertheless
manages
to
taste
far
more
balanced
than
its
ibu
rating
would
have
you
believe
way
to
go
great
divide
a
really
nice
american
barleywine
its
a
unique
one
at
that
as
well
big
hoppy
american
with
rich
almost
english
like
malt
base
but
at
the
same
time
the
hops
arent
your
typical
stinging
hops
i
like
it
not
my
favorite
but
up
there
this
was
bottled
yesterday
so
it
is
a
very
fresh
bottle
expect
to
see
it
in
your
local
store
assuming
it
is
distributed
it
your
area
within
the
next
few
weeks
as
it
plunges
itself
from
the
22
ounce
bottles
and
descends
into
my
chosen
drinking
vessel
it
appears
very
healthy
and
rather
dark
in
color
displaying
its
ruby
hues
the
nose
is
fairly
eccentric
hoppy
as
hell
and
far
from
subtle
with
hints
of
raw
floral
uncut
brutal
hops
caramel
and
fruits
especially
green
melon
the
taste
is
fullbodied
the
alcohol
well
masked
and
the
texture
is
fairly
gripping
the
beer
points
and
laughs
at
the
english
mold
hop
driven
with
notes
of
flowers
citrus
fruits
and
dripping
sappy
pine
the
malt
balances
well
and
showcases
a
nice
lingering
caramel
sweetness
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
beer
will
evolve
in
the
bottle
people
will
flock
to
this
in
herds
drinkabililty
for
a
barleywine
quite
good
but
it
will
sneek
up
on
you
slow
sipper
but
when
the
bottle
was
gone
i
could
have
had
another
glass
simply
a
must
buy
came
across
a
couple
of
22
oz
bottles
for
the
first
time
yesterday
served
in
an
ommegang
three
philosophers
chalice
slightly
chilled
poured
a
nice
darkish
brown
with
a
thick
but
short
head
wonderful
aroma
of
oak
hops
with
a
nice
shot
of
alcohol
tasted
of
caramel
with
slight
oak
with
a
hoppyand
well
hidden
alcohol
finish
dispite
the
abv
this
barley
wine
was
surprisingly
drinkable
with
no
burn
and
a
very
complex
flavor

sweet

loaded
flavoringsoak

up

the
body
is
full
and
fulfilling
hop
bitterness
settles
down
nicely
sweet
malts
and
anise
traces
of
alcohol
are
blended
into
the
mixture
massive
flavoring
that
brings
its
a
game
a
first
class
hoppedup
barley
wine
that
will
put
others
to
shame
superb
overall
i
think
great
divide
is
catering
to
someone
other
than
me
with
this
beer
these
american
style
barley
wines
seem
to
offer
such
a
large
amount
of
hops
that
anything
else
theyre
trying
to
do
is
lost
in
the
explosion
i
dock
a
few
points
for
drinkablity
due
to
the
harsh
alcohol
flavor
after
12
a
glass
i
think
after
a
couple
years
in
the
cellar
that
this
would
be
much
higher
in
the
end
its
a
fantastic
brew
and
at
only
6
29
for
a
bomber
quite
a
deal
in
my
opinion
very
nice
indeed
if
you
want
big
beer
cant
beat
this
great
when
you
are
ready
to
take
a
snooze
or
get
a
straight
jacket
on
yummy
verdict
yowza
they
really
shouldnt
sell
this
in
bombers
by
the
time
you
get
to
the
end
your
taste
buds
are
numbed
to
oblivion
by
the
hops
and
especially
the
alcohol
satisfying
im
so
tempted
to
boost
a
lot
of
these
ratings
up
to
5
0
but
i
just
cant
help
but
imagine
that
things
will
change
and
improve
with
age
seriously
though
this
is
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
had
so
far
and
easily
the
most
enjoyable
if
i
had
to
rename
this
itd
be
great

by
virtue

its

the

really
what
impresses
upon
the

is
the

d
i
will
go
back
to
this
one
again
and
again
by
far
one
of
the
best
barleywines
that
i
have
come
across
it
is
very
complex
yet
familiar
and
comforting
we
drank
this
when
the
temperature
in
orlando
was
a
record
low
and
let
me
tell
you
this
really
warmed
us
up

that
goes
no

constantly
smells
midly
of
hops
with
some
sweet
malts
a
nice
balance
taste
initially
is
somewhat
sweet
and
a
little
fruity
you
also
get
somewhat
of
a
hop
punch
as
well
very
creamy
and
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
a
heavy
hitter
that
isnt
for
the
light
hearted
and
still
very
tasty
if
you
are
a
miller
time
kinda
person
this
isnt
year
beer
but
if
you
are
a
beer
drinker
cheers
to
you
poured
a
lovely
caramel
color
cloudy
and
unfiltered
looking
with
a
normal
head
and
light
lacing
the
nose
was
quite
hoppy
and
i
detected
a
hint
of
coffee
the
taste
was
great
lighter
than
what
i
expected
at
first
i
was
struck
by
slightly
sweet
and
noticed
the
alcohol
i
loved
the
bitter
finish
that
stays
with
you
really
stick
to
the
tongue
overall
i
really
liked
it
definitely
big
drinkability
is
good
a
super
complex
beer
that
works
well
together
alcohol
is
strong
making
this
a
definate
sipper
ive
been
holding
off
on
having
this
for
just
that
reason
its
a
lot
of
beer
for
one
person
my
stomach
is
definatly
warm
right
now
d
very
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
offering
from

would
buy
again

theres
a
good
amount

bitterness
present
as
well
as
bit
of

the
alcohol
makes
an
appearance
in
the
finish
but
is
not
overwhelming
especially
considering
the
high
abv

is
full

and
really
creamy

is
my
favorite

that
ive
had
so
far

is
the
only
thing
i
can
smell
at
first
it
has
caramel

banana
undertones
taste
is
very
bitter
and
very
sweet
with
piney
hops
and
caramel
and
banana
undertones
mouthfeel
is
watery
but
smooth
and
a
little
carbonated
it
also
has
a
slight
coffee
undertone
extremely
wellbalanced
it
seems
to
me
for
a
barleywine
both
big
sweetness
and
big
dryness
are
there
but
with
such
harmony
still
its
rich
the
alchohol
is
evident
very
well
done
drinking
the
entire
bottle
was
highly
enjoyable
and
i
did
not
tire
of
its
taste
of
course
after
just
one
22oz
bottle
of
this
10
2
barley
wine
i
can
only
faintly
remember
the
last
drops
i
dont
know
how
i
am
going
to
finish
a
22oz
bottle
of
this
very
slowly
i
guesss
it
is
just
so
rich
and
thick
but
it
is
still
enjoyable
this
beer
is
just
as
good
as
it
was
when
i
tried
it
last
shit
i
just
noticed
that
these
guys
are
only
a
few
blocks
away
from
avery
bc
ill
have
to
stop
by
there
when
im
in
boulder

time
make
that
a
trio
with
left
hand
bc
mmmm
at
any
rate
quite
the
standout
big
bad
barleywine
this
one
is
thoroughly
enjoyable
id
buy
it
again
recommended
imo
its
tough
to
rate
the
drinkability
of
a
beer
like
this
its
really
delicious
very
well
made
leans
toward
the
hoppy
side
everything
i
love
in
a
barleywine

big

is
good
cloudy

chocolately
at

sniff
followed
by
whiffs
of
vanilla
and
a
smoky
bitterness
taste
is
craaazy
very
powerful
the
first
sip
is
coffee
and
bitter
roasted
hops
things
going
on
bastard
anyone
espresso
fills
the
background
with
a
chewy
bready
quality
that
gives
the
whole
thing
body
texture
and
character
also
some
caramel
hints
a
bitter
tasty
thing

me
lick
my
teeth
very
drinkable
for
a

not
so
much
that
youre
constantly
thinking
about
it
so
it
sneaks
up
on
you
and
kicks
you
in
the
ass
pretty
easily
a
tasty
tasty
thing
old
ruffian
lives
up
to
its
billing
and
is
worth
getting
your
hands
on
all
in
all
a
great
brew
however
this
beer
was
bottled
in
04
and
has
been
cellared
since
correctly
the
aroma
was
excellent
but
a
little
surprising
for
a
barleywine
it
had
a
bit
of
a
roastedburnt
smell
to
go
with
the
heavy
hop
and
orange
aroma
there
was
a
rocky
offwhite
head
the
body
was
hazy
and
dark
amber
the
inital
flavor
was
moderately
sweet
with
a
long
finish
the
hops
aroma
and
taste
did
not
diminish
nothing
surprising
in
the
palate
this
beer
really
lives
up
to
its
billing
once
again
another
great
great
divide
will
be
interested
to
see
what
happens
after
another
year
or
so
on
the
others
i
have
reduces
me
to
gibberish
when
trying
to
describe
it
a
magnificent
brew
pours
a
plumbrown
with
ruby
highlights
in
the
light
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
and
good
retention
for
a
barleywine
a
decent
cap
staying
on
top
for
a
good
while
some
nice
sticky
lacing
nose
is
a
sweet
plumfig
fruitiness
rich
malt
molasses
all
with
a
piney
resinous
hop
scent
overlaying
piney
hops
hit
the
tongue
first
followed
by
a
nice
caramel
bready
malt
some
nice
fruitscherry
plum
orange
pineapple
and
a
nice
bitter
finish
with
a
slight
alcohol
warming
nice
fullbodied
mouthfeel
very
smooth
slightly
creamy
this
is
a
superb
barleywine
stupendous
complexity
of
flavor
yet
a
very
good
balance
very
easy
to
finish
the
bomber
which
is
dangerous
the
color
is
a
dark
ruby
with
a
large
light
brown
head
aroma
is
packed
with
hop
smells
citrusy
and
piney
hops
duke
it
out
for
domination
an
underlying
rich
malt
is
noted
underneath
the
thick
hop
smell
taste
is
equally
hoppy
with
a
long
hoppy
finish
a
rich
underlying
malt
body
is
also
a
treat
to
taste
dark
fruit
flavor
is
also
in
the
mix
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
im
really
surprised
this
is
10
4
anyway
this
beer
is
a
hop
heads
dream
and
another
one
of
those
beers
that
can
get
you
in
trouble
with
its
deceptive
lack
of
alcohol
flavor
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
sweet
with
licorice
at
first
but
then
overwhelmed
by
a
harsh
authoritative
hop
bitterness
itd
be
hard
to
call
this
one
drinkable
especially
once
the
10
2
kicks
in
oddly
enough
is
too
sweet
and
then
too
bitter
without
really
finding
a
balance
it
pours
a
deep
burgandy
in
color
with
a
huge
frothy
head
that
holds
and
laces
fantastically
it
smells
hoppy
surrounded
by
subtle
fruity
aromas
hops
are
the
first
thing
i
notice
on
my
tongue
as
i
continue
to
drink
i
sense
cherry
and
citrus
flavors
that
blend
well
with
the
hops
this
beer
has
a
full
thickness
and
fantastic
carbonation
overall
i
would
love
to
have
this
beer
again
i
think
this
beer
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
and
the
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
light
but
the
hops
and
malt
leave
a
pleasant
taste
in
your
mouth
with
the
taste
and
the
alcohol
hidden
so
well
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
for
me
and
will
definitely
seek
out
again
soon
d
wow
perhaps
one
of
the
most
balanced
american
barley
wines
i
have
ever
had
very
easy
to
sip
and
the
taste
buds
do
not
get
bored
of
this
one
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
barley
wine
im
really
glad
great
divides
beers
are
available
here
in
florida
they
are
quite
the
brewery
drinkability
one
to
savor
i
had
this
over
the
course
of
an
afternoon
and
in
to
the
evening
one
of
my
favorite
american
barley
wines
to
date
this
is
the
real
deal
malt
hop
and
love
strongly
recommended
drinkabilitynotes
an
interesting
example
which
can
be
said
to
expand
the
boundaries
of
the
style
well
worth
a
try
a
treat
for
all
of
the
senses
great
divide
does
it
again
aromas
of
molassas
and
hops
jump
out
of
the
bottle
even
before
the
pour
the
beer
boldly
plops
into
the
glass
with
a
dark
ruby
glow
and
a
tanyellow
head
that
rises
through
the
durration
of
the
glass
continues
to
release
aromas
of
ripe
and
dehydrated
dark
fruits
with
cherries
plumbs
dates
figs
and
bigtime
hop
balance
tastes
very
sweet
and
bold
with
the
same
fruits
as
in
aroma
throw
in
brown
sugar
liqorice
raisons
u
s
hops
for
ultimate
hop
spiciness
boquet
and
flavor
hops
rise
up
to
keep
the
malts
from
becoming
cloying
or
undrinkable
alcohol
flavors
and
feel
comes
on
imediately
and
never
dies
but
never
becomes
too
hot
or
too
fusal
no
flaws
in
this
beer
if
there
were
they
would
become
lost
in
the
abundance
of
flavor
finishes
sweet
yeasty
and
alcoholic
though
its
easy
to
be
put
in
the
top
100
its
similar
to
many
other
great
big
beers
this
beer
pretty
well
defines
the
american
barley
wine
style
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
unlike
old
crusty
or
guardian
this
beer
tastes
great
and
smooth
within
a
year
but
unlike
some
bws
this
beer
is
huge
and
hoppy
and
full
of
flavour
drinkable
young
yet
complex
is
a
rare
quality
so
i
relish
this
beer
and
hope
to
get
another
bottle
in
my
travels
scarily
drinkable
for
a

brew
i
have
to
make
sure
and
stop
myself
after
one
bomber
of
this
gorgeous
brew
well
let
me
tell
you
i
am
torn
on
its
drinkabilty
i
could
sip
a
bomber
say
over
a
period
of
a
couple
of
hours
but
i
think
thats
about
it
with
its
nice
hop
character
this
barleywine
is
a
bit
of
a
palate
wrecker

screams

this

for

this

may
vary
small

aroma

with
some

apricot

sweet

tangy
and
although
it
is
boozy
in
the
way
you
can
tell
it

it
isnt
in
the
way
that
makes
it

notes
thick

and

smooth
for
sure
i
held
onto
this
one
for
a
year
and
a
half
i
like
the
whiskey
quality
its
almost
not
very
beer
like
but
still
glad
i
tried
it
overall
an
excellent
barrel
aged
beer
and
the
old
ruffian
stands
up
well
the
the
barrel
treatment
mouthfeeloverall
obviously
this
beer
was
completely
flat
and
medium
bodied
not
good
overall
this
would
have
been
a
very
fine
example
of
a
ba
barleywine
if
it
was
not
completely
devoid
of
carbonation
hard
telling
if
it
was
always
like
this
or
if
it
just
lost
pressure
while
aging
still
the
flavors
are
there
and
i
quite
enjoyed
the
beer
even
without
carbonation
i
will
rereview
with
a
2011
bottle
i
have
around
overall
i
have
to
give
this
straight
4
5s
theres
little
fault
to
find
in
any
aspect
of
this
beer
outstanding
overall
this
is
wonderful
for
a
two
year
old
barrel
aged
barleywine
this
definitely
isnt
the
best
barrel
aged
barleywine
ive
had
but
it
is
still
a
great
offering
if
youre
able
to
get
your
hands
on
it
and
despite
the
usual
ability
to
age
barley
wines
and
how
well
regular
old
ruffian
ages
id
suggest
drinking
this
one
sooner
rather
than
later
mouthfeel
is
really
good
nice
for
the
style
full
bodied
overall
a
great
carbonation
level
and
super
smooth
theres
a
nice
sweet
finish
with
a
nice
warm
finish
slightly
sharp
at
the
end
not
too
hot
though
and
i
actually
would
have
predicted
a
lower
abv
than
12

really
a
great
beer
strong
the
whole
way
through
but
moderately
gentle
super
drinkable
thanks
geoff
for
the
recommendation
and
the
trade
ive
not
yet
had
the
pleasure
of
making
the
acquaintance
of
the
base
old
ruffian
so
i
can
only
surmise
as
to
the
mollifying
effect
that
the
colorado
whiskey
barrel
has
had
here
though
i
will
say
that
the
understated
effects
have
a
seemingly
positive
spin
more
relevant
supposedly
are
the
big
and
brash
hops
which
do
well
here
to
preserve
the
american
status
of
this
tasty
barleywine
even
as
the
the
wood
is
equally
yankee

nature

nice
touch
of
vanilla
to
bring
the
barrel
to
life
the
touch
of
vanilla
really
helped
this
beer
out
as
without
it
it
could
have
been
a
complete
disaster
without
it
worth
your
time
trying
if
you
get
the
opportunity
great
beer
only
wish
itd
been
cracked
earlier
in
the
tasting
o
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
the
whiskey
bite
is
sharp
but
the
booze
is
well
hidden
and
it
isnt
hot
at
all
again
there
are
some
nice
qualities
about
it
that
are
just
unfortunately
lost
in
is
flat
murky
depths
definitely
very
drinkable
for
12
7
abv
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
with
nice
oak
components
apparent
from
the
barrel
aging
ill
have
pop
the
old
ruffian
soon
to
see
how
it
compares
luckily
this
one
wasnt
infected
like
some
of
the
barrel
aged
yetis
that
were
released
before
this
pours
a
red
amber
color
with
hardly
any
head
at
all
the
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
and
alcohol
this
definitely
tastes
like
it
has
some
age
on
it
the
barrel
characteristics
have
smoothed
but
the
bitterness
level
is
still
quite
high
the
sweet
malt
overtakes
the
bitter
in
the
beginning
of
the
sip
but
the
bitterness
crushes
the
finish
the
body
is
too
thin
with
no
carbonation
overall
incredible
id
like
more
barrel
but
this
is
one
immense
barleywine
othis
is
my
favorite
of
the
ba
great
divide
beers
having
not
had
the
ba
claymore
it
comes
across
like
stranahans
and
old
ruffian
have
enough
common
flavors
in
their
profile
to
really
mesh
well
accentuating
the
toffee
and
caramell
with
an
oaky
vanilla
hint
really
well
done
worth
seeking
out
out
of
the
gate
a
dark
brown
with
an
inch
of
khaki
head
initially
probably
a
little
cold
so
the
first
smell
is
some
sharp
oak
whiskey
and
raisins
as
it
warms
the
aromas
blend
into
a
better
combination
taste
is
similar
with
raisin
sweet
malt
some
hops
whiskey
and
oak
i
wonder
how
bourbon
barrels
would
work
with
the
base
beer
good
amount
of
carbonation
not
too
sticky
not
much
alcohol
burn
overall
an
above
average
bbal
barleywine
glad
to
have
tried
it
m
full
bodied
but
not
overly
thick
i
drank
a
healthy
amount
of
the
bottle
and
wanted
more
very
drinkable
now
with
age
but
a
few
more
years
cant
hurt
sans
a
little
oxidation
a
slow
sipper
something
to
read
a
book
by
the
fire
with
overall
this
is
big
complex
and
interesting
though
the
heavy
booze
quality
and
the
thin
harsh
feel
make
it
quite
challengind
although
great
divide
is
an
excellent
brewery
and
their
regular
old
ruffian
is
good
stuff
id
seek
a
different
barrel
aged
barleywine
if
i
were
looking
for
this
style
id
gladly
try
an
older
bottle
or
a
new
vintage
of
this
when
it
comes
out
but
i
didnt
find
the
2011
is
not
enjoyable
enough
at
this
point
to
go
looking
for
another
one
cheers
again
for
the
trade

i
think
this
was
a
2011
vintage
and
any
heavy
booziness
had
definitely
mellowed
by
the
time
of
the
tasting
making
this
quite
good
overall
second
best
barleywine
of
the
night
id
say
behind
moas
which
is
still
one
of
my
favorite
beers
notes
where
old
ruffian
made
for
a
good
us
barley
wine
the
barrel
aged
version
makes
for
an
outstanding
experience
bottle
with
8
or
9
months
on
it
and
it
feels
assertive
with
some
nice
roundness
it
could
do
with
some
extra
aging
bottle
picked
up
on
my
visit
to
denver
and
wishing
i
had
traveled
back
with
two
more
whiny
about
the
distribution
pulling
out
of
dc
a
year
or
two
ago
a
decent
beer
overall
but
at
this
point
this
one
still
needs
a
bit
of
time
nice
complexities
lurk
underneath
the
booze
but
the
barrel
presence
covers
a
lot
right
now
id
love
to
revisit
this
one
in
a
year
or
so
overall
barrel
aged
old
ruffian
is
clearly
an
outstanding
rendition
of
the
style
perhaps
even
exceptional
however
for
my
tastes
it
would
need
a
touch
more
complexity
a
fuller
synthesis
of
flavors
and
clearly
notable
bourbon
to
truly
put
it
over
the
top
nevertheless
despite
the
steep
price
tag
i
might
be
tempted
to
grab
this
one
again
o
very
good
beer
but
its
just
a
bit
too
dominated
by
the
dark
fruits
in
the
taste
it
also
looks
a
bit
gross
but
overall
its
really
delicious
happy
i
shared
the
bottle
but
its
drinkable
enough
to
want
more
immediately
when
youre
done
giving
a
bump
for
the
great
balance
thanks
for
the
share
4daloveofstout
overall
a
beer
with
some
big
bold
flavours
that
is
perfect
for
sharing
i
think
the
bottle
might
have
benefited
from
a
bit
more
age
to
take
the
edge
off
the
booze
but
it
was
still
quite
smooth
a
great
beer
that
is
well
worth
seeking
out
bottle
poured
a
bright
copper
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
whiskey
is
nice
end
very
enticing
with
nice
balanced
sweet
malt
notes
taste
is
a
great
balance
between
some
whiskey
notes
with
dry
grain
notes
and
a
solid
malt
backbone
with
sweet
caramel
and
light
toffee
notes
body
is
quite
full
with
medium
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
which
i
find
had
great
balance
between
whisky
and
malt
pours
deep
muddy
brown
with
a
decent
sized
mocha
head
smells
very
sweet
and
malty
with
a
little
bit
of
the
barrel
the
malt
bill
is
very
apparent
on
the
first
sip
with
huge
amounts
of
brown
sugar
and
a
maple
syrup
like
taste
that
fades
to
a
very
nice
chard
whiskey
barrel
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
and
carbonation
is
on
the
higher
side
but
in
this
case
it
works
overall
i
am
very
impressed
with
that
way
this
beer
turned
out
just
enough
barrel
presence
to
complement
a
already
impressive
beer
o
this
beer
is
amazing
and
yet
quite
underrated
imo
highly
recommended
overall
old
ruffian
was
my
first
american
barleywine
that
i
liked
when
that
beer
goes
into
barrels
amazing
things
happen
it
a
fantastic
base
beer
for
barrel
aging
this
beer
is
the
best
american
barleywine
that
i
have
drank
and
reviewed
in
almost
500
beer
reviews
there
is
nothing
to
dislike
about
this
beer
it
is
just
so
good
its
a
nice
complex
beer
with
very
well
integrated
barrel
aging
whats
not
too
like
i
honestly
could
drink
a
whole
750
myself
its
just
that
fricking
good
the
boooze
will
sneek
up
on
you
so
be
careful
dangerously
drinkable
at
almost
13
dont
age
this
beer
is
drinking
perfectly
right
now
highly
recommended
for
many
years
to
come
age
will
do
amazing
things
to
this
awesome
brew
o
overall
a
winner
seek
this
one
out
whiskey
is
a
great
match
for
this
barleywine
and
a
nice
change
from
all
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywines
these
days
the
mouthfeel
is
leaning
towards
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
a
little
below
average
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
barrel
aged
beer
but
not
one
that
really
can
hang
with
the
top
of
the
style
things
just
didnt
seem
to
come
together
all
that
well
for
it
at
times
while
it
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
to
sip
on
this
evening
there
is
better
out
there
for
the
price
o
an
all
around
well
balanced
beer
nice
on
all
fronts
but
not
way
up
there
i
imagine
the
whiskey
will
wait
to
impart
its
influence
until
after
it
warms
up
a
bittoo
subtle
an
influence
there
might
provide
for
my
biggest
criticism
so
mellow
and
smooth
a
taste
for
such
a
powerful
beer
i
eagerly
await
it
taking
me
over
no
homotoo
much
shades
of
grey
in
the
collective
consciousness
right
now
this
is
undoubtedly
a
propulsion
into
classy
tastiness
for
the
ol
old
ruffian
2012
vintage
from
a

this

done
right
i
cant
tell
where
the
beer
stops
and
the
whiskey
begins
great
flavor
o
definitely
up
there
in
my
favorite
barrel
aged
barleywines
very
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
slightly
murky
brown
with
a
foamy

the

and
bourbonwhiskey
taste
is
much
the
same
and
quite
sweet
with
an
alcohol
kick
and
woody
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
great

vitamins
burnt

as

hella

qualities
really
not
doing
justice
with
that
sentence
medium

good
beer
wish
i
would
have
bought
some
when
i
had
the
chance
a
couple
years
ago
not
as
thin
or
hot
oddly
enough
but
still
thin
a
bit
more
carbonation
o
i
was
a
bit
worried
after
smelling
it
but
the
taste
is
great
on
this
one
the
base
beer
has
been
toned
down
by
the
barrel
and
the
vanilla
and
whiskey
flavors
really
play
well
with
this
one
my
bottle
says
11
1
so
it
must
have
gone
down
compared
to
previous
years
750ml
bottle
generously
shared
by
jdiddy
pours
slightly
darker
than
unpasteurized
cider
with
no
head
not
much
happening
in
the
nose
i
have
to
say
a
suggestion
of
dark
sugars
its
shocking
how
little
is
revealed
in
the
nose
but
how
robust
the
flavors
are
malty
whiskey
notes
wood
sweet
and
just
a
kiss
of
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
no
carbonation
and
a
slightly
oily
texture
this
beer
has
been
on
my
wants
list
for
quite
some
time
and
i
am
really
grateful
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
a
very
solid
ba
barleywine
although
not
as
mindblowing
as
i
anticipated
given
how
much
i
enjoy
the
standard
offering
overall
the
best
bbbw
ive
had
this
year
incredibly
balanced
and
complex
this
is
one
to
share
as
i
was
really
feeling
the
three
glasses
i
had
i
dont
know
if
its
the
stranahans
barrels
or
not
i
hope
its
not
because
i
dont
know
if
great
divide
will
have
them
available
anymore
after
the
deal
with
breckenridge
seek
this
beer
out
as
it
is
fantastic
o
very
drinkable
stranahans
whiskey
is
amazing
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
o
conflicted
as
liked
the
beer
but
in
reality
prefer
regular
ruffian
more
might
be
showing
its
age
a
bit
as
was
thin
in
spots
and
needed
a
lot
of
air
to
open
this
up
decent
enough
stuff
but
not
on
par
with
other
ba
barleywines
out
there
not
as
much
substance
to
the
body
as
others
out
there
o
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
too
exciting
definitely
not
on
the
top
tier
level
but
slightly
above
average
for
the
style
this
is
another
barrel
aged
beer
that
spent
way
too
much
time
in
the
barrel
alternatively
this
should
have
been
blended
with
some
fresh
old
ruffian
as
i
am
really
wishing
the
base
beer
came
through
in
some
way
as
it
is
this
is
purely
a
vehicle
for
the
stranahan
barrels
if
that
is
your
thing
then
you
will
enjoy
this
beer
but
if
you
are
looking
for
beer
then
you
might
be
a
bit
disappointed
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
a
little
bit
so
it
is
not
a
complete
loss
but
not
enough
to
remotely
want
to
finish
this
bottle
by
myself
i
might
finish
my
glass
drink
thanks
joe
this
was
a
long
time
want
of
mine
and
with
the
first
beer
of
the
night
being
this
i
knew
it
was
gonna
be
a
good
tasting
a
great
beer
with
large
flavors
thinner
bodied
than
expected
with
a
slick
mouthfeel
that
gibes
way
toward
the
end
of
the
palate
to
a
dry
slightly
hot
finish
well
balanced
with
a
decent
barrel
character
that
doesnt
overpoweroverwhelm
the
other
flavors
dry
toasted
oak
flavor
along
with
some
sweet
bourbon
and
a
strong
vanilla
character
this
is
countered
midpalate
by
some
earthy
malt
and
hints
of
caramel
toffee
and
hazelnut
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
booze
but
the
high
abv
is
well
masked
resulting
in
one
of
the
most
quaffable
barrel
aged
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
thanks
again
kiel
o
huge
disappointment
wish
i
could
have
had
this
a
bit
younger
hope
my
ba
yeti
doesnt
do
this
i
would
definitely
taste
this
again
but
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
trade
for
it
recommended
cheers
o
decent
but
not
great
frankly
might
pass
if
offered
again
but
would
like
to
try
a
fresh
or
1
year
aged
bottle
for
comparison
o
this
beer
is
pretty
complex
its
definitely
enjoyable
but
i
had
higher
expectations
for
it
tasty
and
enjoyable
otherwise
o
like
this
beer
although
for
more
bitter
things
id
generally
prefer
a
dipa
this
is
a
nice
beer
though
i
dont
have
my
typical
review
lined
up
for
this
beer
because
i
fear
it
may
have
been
an
off
bottle
im
giving
it
all
1
0s
to
reflect
exactly
how
bad
i
felt
this
particular
bottle
was
no
pfft
on
the
capcrack
had
me
thinking
that
this
was
simply
low
on
the
carbonation
pouring
the
beer
as
hard
as
possible
revealed
zilch
in
the
way
of
carbonation
in
the
puce
colored
beer
the
body
was
thin
and
watery
to
boot
which
has
me
thinking
something
was
just
flat
out
wrong
here
smelled
like
generic
malt
and
tasted
like
watered
malt
that
had
wet
whiskey
barrel
dunked
in
it
some
slight
sourness
and
acetone
suggests
a
possible
infection
i
cant
give
the
standard
smells
and
flavors
that
i
usually
report
because
it
was
so
off
and
weird
if
i
was
guessing
600
of
the
750mls
ended
up
going
down
the
drain
ill
try
this
again
if
the
opportunity
presents
itself
but
no
way
am
i
going
to
trade
for
another
this
is
very
tasty
its
not
a
session
beer
for
sure
but
it
is
delicious
i
hope
to
get
to
taste
this
again
someday
this
is
going
right
back
on
my
want
list
this
is
barleywine
number
four
for
those
of
you
keeping
track
at
home
compared
side
by
side
with
the
nonba
version
this
beer
was
rather
interesting
the
first
thing
that
can
be
said
about
it
is
that
this
beer
is
devoid
of
bubbles
totally
flat
carbonation
kaput
etc
though
its
reddish
amber
color
is
still
rather
inviting
the
aromatics
of
this
beer
are
a
good
deal
of
mellow
bourbon
characteristics
there
is
a
lot
more
vanilla
on
the
nose
of
this
barrel
than
on
previously
smelled
ba
beers
there
are
lots
of
good
and
subtle
flavors
aside
from
the
vanilla
oak
and
bourbon
which
have
mellowed
to
a
really
nice
point
the
main
flavors
are
a
rum
raisin
butterscotch
and
strong
notes
of
fig
its
rather
tasty
stuff
if
only
it
wasnt
a
flat
syrup
it
might
be
even
better
overall
this
was
tasty
and
i
am
loving
this
series
of
barleywines
because
theres
not
been
a
bad
one
amongst
them
o
apparently
flat
bitter
bourbon
isnt
my
thing
2009
edition
bottle
6271188
im
very
curious
to
see
how
the
ruffian
takes
to
the
barrelaging
it
pours
a
slightly
murky
garnetamber
topped
by
a
very
minor
bit
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
bourbon
oak
caramel
vanilla
toffee
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
the
taste
holds
notes
of
orange
peel
bourbon
oak
vanilla
light
cocoa
ruby
red
grapefruit
and
near
the
finish
a
light
and
vague
semiastringency
luckily
that
last
bit
aint
enough
to
really
mess
with
things
the
body
is
a
heftyish
medium
with
a
very
light
carbonation
and
a
kinda
oily
feel
overall
a
very
nice
bit
o
barrelaged
bwine
goodness
nuff
said
d
a
definite
sipper
sophisticated
worldly
unfortunately
the
best
barrel
aged
beers
are
those
that
add
depth
and
complexity
to
the
base
beer
unfortunately
in
this
case
the
barrel
aging
takes
away
from
the
old
ruffian
components
while
the
alcohol
component
is
nice
overall
this
one
is
a
slight
disappointment
full
bodied
decent
carbonation
this
gets
a
stamp
of
approval
even
though
im
not
a
fan
of
american
barleywines
oglsd
i
got
to
try
it
moreage
would
have
done
it
favors
d
as
always
id
rather
an
english
barleywine
with
barrel
aging
but
i
like
this
pours
a
murky
amber
brown
not
really
an
attractive
looking
beer
a
bit
of
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
phenomenal
the
nose
is
awesome
tastes
heavily
of
bourbon
with
a
touch
of
hops
but
not
very
bitter
vry
dry
on
the
pallette
but
the
bourbon
character
is
the
only
thing
that
carries
it
it
should
be
obvious
but
this
one
needs
a
while
to
warm
my
first
sips
didnt
impress
but
the
more
it
warmed
the
happier
i
was
not
quite
the
supremely
worldclass
beer
that
ba
yeti
is
but
how
many
are
there
really
but
damn
excellent
in
its
own
right
id
be
willing
to
drink
this
anyevery
night
of
the
week
bottle
303
and
thanks
i
believe
to
jason
b
having
this
was
like
having
an
old
friend
over
after
several
years
wiser
and
more
interesting
at
serious
wine
booziness
it
was
a
major
challenge
to
conduct
intellectual
exercises
great
looks
with
a
toinch
head
boozy
but
also
woody
aromas
mellow
hoppy
oaky
full
mouthfeel
it
was
very
satisfying
the
bourbon
thank
gd
was
minor
as
we
canadians
are
not
such
big
corn
whiskey
fans
i
was
getting
more
excellent
oak
a
great
blending
and
something
i
wanted
to
share
and
is
meant
to
share
but
could
not
on
the
coldest
night
of
the
year
d
goes
down
easy
enough
but
i
wouldnt
want
a
ton
of
this
i
was
happy
with
the
pour
i
got
love
the
regular
version
and
this
is
definitely
a
delicious
brew
thanks
again
jeff
for
your
generosity
taste
is
really
quite
nice
with
the
booze
mingling
with
the
dark
fruits
and
sweetness
in
a
really
fantastic
way
good
barrel
character
with
some
nice
toffee
and
caramel
a
bit
hoppy
as
well
mouthfeel
melds
the
barrel
character
some
sweetness
booze
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
quite
well
definitely
a
well
made
brew
not
quite
as
good
as
the
ba
yeti
but
quite
good
and
im
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
thanks
again
paul
d
i
was
very
excited
to
sample
this
limited
release
and
would
definitely
have
it
again
best
enjoyed
in
small
quantities
this
beer
is
ideal
for
sharing
a
few
ways
edit
had
this
again
on
21311
at
maxs
in
baltimore
md
thanks
to
jslot38
enjoyed
it
even
more
the
second
time
around
and
added
a
few
notes
d
pretty
low
lack
of
carbonation
hurts
tremendously
flavors
are
good
but
the
nonexistent
carbonation
is
a
real
problem
this
is
a
bit
rough
i
had
very
high
expectations
that
sadly
are
not
even
close
to
being
realized
overall
it
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
i
expected
more
the
nose
was
a
bit
muted
but
the
taste
got
better
decent
drinkability
d
its
a
good
beer
easily
drinking
my
glass
but
its
a
big
beer
sharing
with
2
others
is
great
first
i
love
old
ruffian
and
look
forward
to
its
release
every
year
so
i
was
very
excited
to
finally
try
this
one
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
ruby
edges
and
a
light
brown
head
that
hangs
around
for
quite
a
while
on
the
nose
i
picked
up
a
little
oxidation
some
grassy
hops
and
a
little
bourbon
on
the
palate
medium
bodied
rich
alcoholic
with
a
little
bourbon
and
branch
oak
milk
chocolate
dark
fruits
and
caramel
the
stranahans
barrels
add
a
nice
complexity
to
an
otherwise
hoppy
barley
wine
but
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
fresh
and
eagerly
anticipate
the
arrival
of
the
2010
version
bottle
pours
a
murky
orange
color
with
a
slight
white
head
the
aroma
is
farily
fruity
to
me
with
notes
of
apples
and
pears
mixed
with
some
barrel
notes
the
taste
is
very
similiar
to
the
aroma
sweet
fruit
flavors
up
front
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
almost
too
easy
no
real
hop
characteristics
very
smooth
medium
mouthfeel
slight
warming
effect
from
the
alcohol
d
nothing
offensive
nothing
great
just
very
middleoftheroad
as
far
as
a
barrelaged
barleywine
goes
i
wonder
if
it
was
just
a
bad

complements
a
very
solid

highly
recommended
though
i
heard
the
second

of

isnt
as
good

the

thanks

bringing
this

vanilla

could

pours
dark
amber
with
a
nice
tight
head
smells
wonderfully
sweet
and
whiskeyish
with
notes
of
coconut
whiskey
and
light
grain
with
some
spicebox
aromas
on
the
finish
seamlessly
integrated
and
very
nice
the
taste
is
a
little
hotter
and
a
little
more
overtly
oaky
but
luckily
the
oak
doesnt
dominate
still
has
nice
notes
of
coconut
and
whiskey
along
with
the
wood
notes
and
the
heat
a
bit
hot
in
the
mouth
but
smooth
very
nice
indeed
there
may
have
been
a
problem
with
the
bottle
i
got
judging
by
the
issues
with
carbonation
awesome
beer
overall
great
even
for
the
style
of
bal
aged
awesomebeer
needs
at
least
two
more
years
probably
five
for
the
oak
and
peppery
sting
to
settle
no
sign
of
the
sherrylike
i
describe
it
as
soured
caramellike
oxidation
that
would
so
enrich
the
flavor
of
this
beer
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
good
barrel
character
overall
its
a
bit
muddy
and
i
think
that
with
another
year
or
so
in
the
cellar
this
one
will
be
amazing
now
to
find
another
somewhere
this
is
a
well
made
brew
that
feels
a
little
unintegrated
at
this
point
i
imagine
with
some
more
age
on
it
it
would
be
amazing
and
one
of
the
best
d
i
was
really
shocked
by
the
amount
of
bitterness
this
beer
still
had
a
nice
beer
all
around
beer
seems
heavy
very
malty
sweet
up
front
finishes
slightly
dry
overall
mouthfeel
is
good
no
carbonation
in
mouth
unfortunately
but
its
still
good
overall
a
smooth
mouthfeel
there
is
some
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
thanks
lunch
d
drinks
easy
for
as
big
as
it
is
bit
no
carbo
while
ba
old
ruffian
isnt
as
mindblowing
as
ba
yeti
its
still
a
remarkable
ale
that
i
feel
incredibly
lucky
to
have
experienced
thanks
to
jmbsh
for
both
bottles
i
would
still
take
the
original
over
this
beer
and
99
9
of
all
beer
on
earth
but
baor
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
of
2010
so
far
it
has
flavors
of
pine
and
earth
leather
and
tobacco
some
whiskey
sweetness
that
balances
the
oak
and
hops
sherrylike
oxidation
contributes
depth
fullbodied
with
a
boozy
oaky
caramel
finish
and
lingering
resiny
hops
this
is
pretty
dry
and
hoppy
for
a
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
the
style
this
is
delicious
stuff
the
barrelaging
process
lends
a
sharp
green
fresh
tannic
woodenness
to
the
normal
old
ruffian
barleywine
profile
loads
of
whiskey
flavor
almost
as
if
ale
spirits
were
blended
and
bottled
mouthfeel
is
smooth
chewy
and
breathy
with
booze
but
far
from
hot
low
carbonation
thick
body
and
a
slightly
bitter
hop
note
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
a
sipper
for
sure
and
something
id
gladly
have
again
i
almost
wish
i
couldve
checked
my
baggage
flying
home
from
denver
and
given
this
beer
some
age
but
it
was
still
wonderful
fresh
a
tad
pricey
but
a
treat
worth
savoring
overall
quite
a
treat
not
a
disappointment
in
any
sense
for
what
it
is
and
really
seems
a
great
display
of
barrel
aging
for
this
big
hopforward
barleywine
though
if
old
ruffian
is
your
favorite
beer
dont
expect
this
one
to
wow
you
with
being
bigger
and
better
because
it
really
seems
to
come
out
of
the
barrel
its
own
creation
definitely
one
i
wish
i
had
more
bottles
around
to
sit
on
for
a
couple
year
limited
production
im
stocking
up
so
get
it
while
you
can
its
pretty
hot
right
now
so
i
would
say
to
hold
on
to
it
for
now
you
can
tell
that
its
heavy
but
the
12
7
is
well
integrated
quite
drinkable
a
tasty
beer
but
like
the
barrel
aged
yeti
not
appreciably
better
than
the
original
ive
tasted
threeyearold
old
ruffian
that
was
a
lot
hoppier
than
this
interpretation
perhaps
thats
what
happens
when
you
put
the
beer
in
whiskey
barrels
the
palate
opens
with
plenty
of
barrel
character
caramel
vanilla
and
oak
tannins
not
as
complex
as
the
nose
suggests
theres
still
plenty
of
nuance
though
with
honey
brown
sugar
and
caramel
boozy
heat
appears
midpalate
lingering
on
into
the
finish
vanilla
is
moderately
noticeable
as
well
a
touch
tannic
this
aspect
helps
balance
out
the
mellow
sweetness
of
the
beer
mediumhigh
in
body
and
quite
low
in
carbonation
this
feels
great
on
the
palate
soft
and
lush
until
the
tannins
take
a
hold
the
way
this
beer
segues
from
a
maltforward
experience
to
the
oak
finish
is
quite
excellent
as
i
sip
this
alongside
the
ba
old
numbskull
i
can
only
be
thankful
for
both
the
experience
and
the
decadence
of
it
all
i
would
love
to
try
this
with
a
few
years
on
it
a
very
impressive
effort
from
the
folks
at
great
divide
bottom
line
great
looking
beer
colourwise
though
the
lack
of
any
real
foam
hurts
just
a
tad
very
weak
smell
but
more
than
made
up
for
by
the
taste
which
is
superb
mouthfeel
on
the
thin
side
and
the
carbonation
or
lack
thereof
in
my
final
analysis
works
ok
as
it
does
in
certain
other
brews
drinkability
is
another
very
strong
point
for
this
brew
overall
id
have
to
say
highly
recommended
d
its
relatively
easy
to
drink
considering
the
heft
to
it
but
it
still
took
my
a
while
to
put
down
my
6oz
or
so
a
very
nice
beer
but
for
the
price
i
think
there
are
better
options
available
d
suprisingly
good
considering
its
heft
this
bottle
is
meant
to
be
shared
by
many
drinkability
ba
or
is
a
good
beer
it
is
not
a
great
beer
and
on
the
whole
i
find
it
lacking
in
many
of
the
ways
that
makes
old
ruffian
itself
a
truly
great
beer
i
cant
help
but
thinking
that
the
barrel
aging
really
adds
as
much
to
this
beer
as
it
takes
away
from
it
while
it
augments
the
rough
harshly
pleasant
earthiness
of
this
beer
it
also
thins
if
out
while
it
compliments
the
underlying
sweetness
with
barrel
sugars
it
also
kills
the
head
and
mutes
the
bitterness
in
the
mouth
and
nose
and
though
the
barrel
aging
may
be
on
the
whole
a
wash
the
higher
abv
does
knock
the
drinkability
down
a
little
so
definitely
worth
having
if
barrel
aging
particularly
whiskey
barrel
aging
is
your
thing
but
since
most
people
wont
get
the
chance
to
try
it
dont
feel
bad
if
the
plain
ol
every
day
old
ruffian
is
the
only
thing
you
have
access
to
youre
more
than
breakin
even
drinkability
very
drinkablegoes
down
smooth
with
almost
no
alcohol
evidentwhich
i
think
is
spectacular
given
the
high
abv
nicely
done
here
d
excellent
beer
but
i
think
it
loses
a
bit
in
the
barrel
d
definately
a
beer
to
be
sipped
d
no
problem
drinking
this
one
the
abv
will
kick
my
ass
in
the
end
but
ill
keep
drinking
until
i
cant
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
smooth
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
about
as
solid
as
could
be
one
of
the
biggest
baddest
barrel
aged
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
trying
this
one
again
any
day
overall
ill
be
the
first
to
admit
that
im
a
sucker
for
bourbon
in
beer
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
d
awesome
sipper
so
smooth
and
mellow
but
slightly
hot
however
a
bourbon
barreled
barleywine
has
got
to
have
some
balls
though
right
d
if
not
for
the
big
flavors
and
the
abv
i
would
drink
this
all
night
drinks
easy
enough
for
the
style
not
the
best
abw
ive
had
but
pretty
damn
good
way
over
priced
at
25
dollars
a
750
ml
bottle
imho
this
is
a
great
beer
but
the
bourbon
in
the
taste
might
be
a
tad
too
much
for
me
either
way
im
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
it
d
this
ones
pretty
intense
certainly
wouldnt
want
to
drink
an
entire
bottle
of
this
but
its
great
for
sharing
another
must
for
the
winter
beer
flight
pours
a
great
ruby
brown
color
with
a
big
frothy
head
the
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
some
earthy
hops
and
fruity
esters
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
some
whisky
oak
and
vanilla
flavor
is
very
alcoholic
and
the
whisky
and
oak
are
less
apparent
than
in
the
nose
ba
ruffian
is
sweet
with
a
low
level
of
hoppiness
finish
is
sweet
alcohol
the
beer
is
medium
full
bodied
with
great
carbonation
drinkability
this
is
a
great
beer
and
my
favorite
of
the
two
ba
beers
great
divide
released
i
am
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
thanks
again
jonathan
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
drinkability
was
pretty
high
for
such
a
huge
beer
all
the
extra
time
spent
in
barrels
really
smoothed
out
the
edges
on
this
beer
mellowing
out
the
booziness
and
adding
to
the
complexity
i
am
pretty
pleased
with
the
final
product
that
said
im
really
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
thanks
again
ryan
d
world
class
simply
put
this
is
an
amazing
beer
d
amazing
i
definitely
need
to
try
the
whiskey
from
next
door
they
use
this
pours
a
glowing
hazy
cedar
and
has
a
silky
tan
head
the
nose
has
a
complex
blend
of
oak
and
whiskey
up
front
with
sweet
candy
malts
ripe
fruit
and
subtle
hops
through
the
finish
the
barrel
aging
compliments
this
ale
very
well
it
creates
a
super
complex
flavor
profile
with
perfect
balance
delicate
yet
full
body
suits
the
style
the
best
beer
great
divide
has
ever
brewed
by
the
way
open
this
carefully
my
bottle
overflowed
a
little
bit
great
looking
brew
a
deep
burgundy
color
that
has
lasted
the
entire
session
so
far
at
least
30
minutes
fairly
nice
nose
has
some
complexity
from
the
barrel
vanilla
whiskey
newer
oak
as
well
as
some
notes
from
the
original
beer
caramel
fruit
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
between
original
beer
and
oak
elements
bold
flavors
of
whiskey
caramel
toffee
and
vanilla
very
tasty
and
impressive
in
every
way
a
good
beer
now
but
being
that
it
is
properly
bottle
conditioned
this
ale
has
excellent
potential

these
expensive
beers
scare
me
i
was
not
disappointed
that
i
bought
this
one
nice
dark
brown
color
darker
than
normal
ruffian
smells
like
whiskey
vanilla
hops
tastes
like
oak
vanilla
whiskey
but
subtle
with
hints
of
toffee
that
i
get
from
regular
ruffian
this
is
not
just
whiskey
you
can
actually
taste
the
barleywine
in
this
nice
one
small
sip
does
warm
the
belly
so
you
can
feel
the
alcohol
but
it
doesnt
play
much
of
a
factor
in
the
taste
this
is
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
i
did
this
beer
a
disservice
by
holding
on
to
it
this
long
im
sure
it
was
better
when
fresher
if
you
have
one
of
these
drink
it
within
a
year
or
2
dont
hold
on
to
it
too
long
poured
from
a
brown
22
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
dark
fruits
malts
taste
is
malty
alcohol
dark
fruits
easy
drinking
considering
the
abv
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
quality
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
barleywine
but
nothing
particularly
stands
out
about
it
good
balance
good
mouthfeel
not
overwhelming
in
any
way
rjt
strong
stuff
it
has
a
dark
ale
flavor
and
has
that
familiar
molasses
taste
was
a
little
frothy
and
the
bitterness
hits
you
like
a
wall
after
a
few
sips
o
decent
but
not
remarkable
better
than
some
attempts
but
the
hops
seem
to
have
faded
awful
quickly
probably
would
have
been
very
drinkable
fresh
im
not
a
barleywine
fan
but
this
isnt
half
bad
it
loses
points
on
both
taste
and
aroma
because
i
can
detect
no
hops
otherwise
it
meets
the
criteria
for
an
americanstyle
barleywine
malty
breads
citrus
with
some
mild
spice
in
the
nose
toffee
lots
of
toffee
plum
berries
slightly
citrus
bready
very
smooth
a
nice
barleywine
not
extraordinary
but
solid
specific
issues
with
the
cloudyish
look
of
the
beer
not
very
appetizing
smells
good
and
the
malts
dominate
the
hops
this
is
the
2nd
time
ive
had
this
beer
and
i
didnt
love
it
the
first
time
and
i
still
dont
there
is
some
weird
flavor
going
on
that
i
cant
figure
out
but
it
seems
to
ruin
it
for
me
aside
from
the
metallic
taste
that
is
a
bit
harsh
on
the
tongue
initially
i
found
this
beer
to
be
smooth
sweet
and
creamy
if
not
for
that
offtaste
id
absolutely
love
this
beer
santa
fe
got
to
love
a
local
brew
by
local
one
of
the
closests
in
west
texas
hops
are
prevalant
but
in
this
barleywine
it
shares
the
light
with
the
malt
well
pipes
dark
to
medium
brown
with
milk
chocolate
head
smell
is
of
noble
hops
and
taste
is
a
decent
mix
between
malt
and
hops
the
aftertaste
is
clean
and
subtle
ipa
like
overall
a
good
local
big
beer
burnt
orange
to
amber
colored
body
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
little
to
no
nose
there
is
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
pure
alcohol
just
tastes
like
grain
alcohol
and
acetone
this
beer
is
way
off
nothing
wrong
with
the
bottle
and
purchased
recently
as
well
no
bottle
dating
nothing
positive
about
this
beer
i
got
a
light
sweetness
up
front
that
is
destroyed
by
the
grain
alcoholacetone
taste
a
decently
understated
american
barleywine
if
were
to
take
their
word
for
it
i
think
this
tastes
exactly
what
an
imperial
esb
might
want
to
taste
like
so
that
would
default
to
english
all
around
in
my
book
anyways
wellmade
and
definitely
not
too
heavy
other
than
in
the
abv
which
is
conspicuous
only
in
its
general
absence
wait
for
it
i
know
final
thoughts
as
my
second
barleywine
this
doesnt
appear
to
be
a
style
that
does
it
for
me
its
like
a
high
abv
belgian
gone
wrong
ill
pass
but
that
doesnt
mean
you
should
ive
heard
too
much
about
bachelorette
parties
now
gimme
a
beer
dammit
this
stuff
pours
a
murky
sunset
auburn
topped
by
a
finger
of
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
ryeish
biscuit
light
toffee
mild
tobaccolike
greens
a
twinge
of
candied
orange
peel
and
a
hint
of
celery
the
taste
continues
the
trend
with
a
spicy
biscuit
backbone
riding
high
in
the
saddle
surrounded
by
mixed
greens
that
dont
pack
much
of
a
bitter
wallop
but
still
serve
as
a
minor
balance
to
the
malt
theres
a
slight
twang
of
booze
but
nothing
that
distracts
from
the
main
attractions
the
body
is
a
heftyleaning
medium
with
a
rather
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
nice
surprisingly
easygoing
barleywine
one
that
showcases
a
balance
and
a
restraint
you
dont
normally
find
stateside
good
times
its
a
tasty
barleywine
not
my
favorite
but
worth
a
try
for
barleywine
lovers
o
this
isnt
a
bad
barleywine
but
its
not
a
great
one
either
good
a
fine
heavy
yet
intriguingly
tasty
malted
beverage
your
palate
gets
treated
to
a
variety
of
malt
hop
and
boozy
flavors
that
mix
well
together
always
providing
nuanced
taste
treats
when
allowed
to
coat
the
palate
yes
a
damn
fine
beer
o
this
is
a
nice
barleywine
that
aged
nicely
letting
it
warm
is
definitely
the
key
to
success
o
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
definitely
very
tasty
but
it
was
overshadowed
by
the
leon
we
had
right
before
it
o
excellent
interpretation
of
the
style
not
overly
complex
but
not
overly
dull
it
had
just
the
right
amount
of
complexities
to
keep
the
nose
the
taste
and
the
mouth
feel
in
check
its
very
surprising
how
they
got
the
alcohol
so
well
hidden
with
a
10abv
worthy
of
multiple
purchases
o
im
liking
this
beer
but
just
wish
that
the
sweetness
was
dialed
back
a
bit
22oz
bottle
served
in
a
snifter
poured
a
hazy
reddish
gold
with
a
finger
of
off
white
head
caramelized
sugar
and
hops
in
the
aroma
medium
to
full
bodied
more
caramelized
sugar
fair
amount
of
hop
bitterness
to
balance
sweetness
easy
drinking
for
10
abv
d
not
as
drinkable
as
some
other
barleywines
much
less
refined
overall
this
beer
aged
nicely
very
smooth
sweet
barleywine
price
was
also
good
cheap
quality
beer
nothing
in
the
top
10
for
its
style
but
solid
enough
that
i
would
order
one
again
i
3
barleywines
just
an
o
k
beer
its
easy
to
drink
and
packs
a
punch
but
it
lacks
the
depth
a
good
barley
wine
should
have
overall
impression
more
like
a
traditional
english
barleywine
this
one
missed
the
style
a
bit
more
hop
should
have
been
included
and
should
not
have
been
so
hotsharp
still
enjoyed
nonetheless
and
would
love
to
pick
up
another
bottle
of
this
and
sit
on
it
a
notice
to
all
the
micro
brews
pursuing
and
passing
off
this
style
of
brewing
as
barley
wine
a
traditional
barley
wine
should
be
well
over
10
abv
ive
had
as
high
as
18
6
and
the
name
implies
both
the
body
weight
and
taste
comparable
in
weight
to
a
fullbodied
red
wine
with
a
winey
mouthfeel
and
taste
defined
most
by
barley
not
hops
with
an
impression
of
sweetness
from
the
grain
without
these
basic
characteristics
youre
making
a
fullbodied
ale
but
not
a
barley
wine
regardless
of
whether
or
not
barley
was
used
in
the
brewing
poured
maple
brown
slight
murkiness
with
scant
head
a
couple
minutes
later
and
it
looked
quite
still
although
it
did
have
a
very
smooth
carbonation
lots
of
sweetness
here
caramel
brown
sugar
and
a
hint
of
figs
very
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
and
the
sweetness
definitely
carries
further
quite
smooth
and
delicious
overall
its
a
good
american
barleywine
i
would
have
appreciated
a
touch
more
bitterness
as
the
sweetness
is
quite
prominent
it
did
indeed
make
for
a
great
postexam
celebration
o
goes
down
ok
somewhat
tasty
not
too
filling
big
kick
ok
representation
of
style
this
may
have
needed
some
more
age
on
it
beer
is
a
bit
hot
not
as
smooth
as
other
american
barleywines
ive
had
but
certainly
still
a
decent
effort
a
big
boozy
slow
sipper
overall
drinkability
very
smooth
nt
very
complex
but
very
drinkable
for
the
style
deceptive
alcohol
not
very
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
and
i
was
glad
to
get
a
couple
bottles
i
wouldnt
have
sought
it
out
but
for
my
pal
jon
a
former
santa
fe
resident
living
up
here
who
said
this
was
his
favorite
brew
i
gave
him
one
of
the
two
bottles
i
had
and
we
shared
the
other
one
over
thanksgiving
dinner
turducken
a
good
beer
enhanced
by
a
good
time
pours
a
slightly
murky
honey
orange
with
a
1
inch
puffy
light
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
a
foamy
curtain
of
lace
coats
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
toffee
and
lots
of
citrus
zest
taste
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
and
somewhat
strong
citrus
zest
flavors
a
slight
apricot
flavor
on
the
aftertaste
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
barleywine
but
its
a
bit
out
of
balance
for
my
tastes
i
wish
there
was
more
malty
sweetness
to
go
along
with
the
hoppy
flavors
id
say
aged
is
the
best
way
to
have
this
beer
if
it
were
fresh
the
malt
wouldnt
be
big
enough
to
combat
the
hops
bronze
color
though
somewhat
murky
not
a
lot
of
head
though
some
decent
lacing
malty
and
caramel
aroma
right
upfront
a
very
faint
whiff
of
smokeprobably
more
perceived
then
actually
there
toffee
and
buttery
flavor
mildly
astringent
hop
bite
a
hair
out
of
balance
with
the
hops
mildly
boozey
though
not
overly
so
and
not
in
a
detrimental
way
sticky
and
gummy
mouthfeel
the
upfront
sweetness
quickly
becomes
dry
enjoyable
all
in
have
wanted
to
try
this
for
ages
a
touch
rough
in
spots
but
a
damn
nice
us
barleywine
this
pours
a
nice
murky
brown
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
which
quickly
dissipates
the
smells
are
of
malt
and
alcohol
the
feel
is
good
and
somewhat
thick
the
taste
is
a
little
disappointing
i
get
plenty
of
the
malts
but
low
bitterness
and
hops
to
offset
it
im
too
used
to
the
over
hopped
american
barley
wines
which
this
isnt
and
there
is
plenty
of
alcohol
heat
not
well
hidden
at
all
o
not
impressed
by
this
wellnamed
offering
from
sfb
ckbw
doesnt
keep
up
with
their
canned
series
this
brew
is
not
highly
recommended
but
worth
trying
with
a
group
of
friends
d
better
than
the
og
the
booze
has
mellowed
out
quite
a
bit
over
the
course
of
two
years
which
is
a
very
good
thing
very
glad
i
have
a
few
more
to
see
how
its
doing
but
its
really
at
a
sweet
spot
right
now
seek
out
this
vintage
overall
needs
some
smoothing
out
around
the
edges
touch
too
boozy
but
still
rather
wonderful
now
i
would
love
to
see
a
year
or
two
of
age
on
this
one
and
i
particularly
like
how
it
manages
to
be
incredibly
malty
but
not
syrupy
and
never
too
sweet
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
poured
from
bomber
into
vintage
jax
mug
this
is
a
stout
delicious
and
fairly
complex
beer
i
am
a
fan
of
barleywines
and
must
say
this
is
probably
the
most
balanced
one
i
have
ever
had
pours
a
beautiful
amber
red
with
a
quickly
dissolving
3
finger
head
pretty
nice
lacing
tastes
of
honey
and
cherries
with
a
biting
but
not
unpleasant
aftertaste
of
pure
alcohol
great
mouth
feel
almost
a
nectar
smells
mostly
of
cherries
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
to
drink
barleywines
ive
ever
come
across
about
as
close
to
a
session
beer
as
this
style
could
ever
be
not
that
thats
saying
much
excellent
would
buy
again
cook
with
and
even
save
a
spot
in
the
cellar
for
pretty
good
beer
i
let
it
warm
a
bit
from
the
fridge
poured
with
a
small
to
medium
size
thick
creamy
light
tan
head
that
lasts
a
long
time
and
a
little
lace
color
is
a
clear
cherry
orange
amber
and
some
bubble
trails
aroma
is
a
pronounced
blend
of
malt
caramel
toffee
hops
fruit
yeast
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
and
has
a
very
good
balance
between
sweet
bitter
and
tang
body
is
also
very
good
full
and
round
with
a
few
high
points
while
carbonation
is
perhaps
just
a
tad
light
finish
is
like
flavor
has
good
length
and
has
some
alcohol
a
slow
sipping
brew
over
the
course
of
a
bomber
or
two
enjoyed
this
a
lot
conclusion
i
will
seek
this
out
again
and
see
if
another
bottle
shows
the
same
flaws
or
if
this
isnt
a
tasty
beer
d
cant
handle
too
much
of
this
one
tastes
are
chalk
seaweed
sweet
malt
barley
flaked
wheat
grains
booze
wood
yeast
cloth
strong
beer
with
a
little
bit
of
age
on
them
stuff
and
hops
smells
are
toffee
chalk
mixed
drinks
pills
credit
cards
aluminum
and
tin
mmmmm
not
a
sensation
just
alright
o
i
dont
think
this
beer
was
all
too
bad
the
alcohol
seemed
to
be
a
little
overpowering
at
times
but
i
think
i
might
have
kept
my
bottle
a
little
too
long
i
do
have
another
bottle
which
i
will
crack
open
again
just
to
see
really
fizzy
in
the
mouth
for
a
barley
wine
carbonation
lasts
and
lasts
in
the
glass
still
its
easy
to
drink
especially
if
you
think
of
it
as
an
improved
product
from
champale
or
maybe
im
confusing
it
with
manischewitz
almonetta
this
beer
pours
a
reddish
mahogany
with
a
very
nice
off
white
to
light
yellow
head
minor
bubbles
and
good
lacing
smell
of
candied
sugars
hot
caramel
plums
raisins
and
cinnamon
taste
is
pretty
sweet
of
caramel
and
toffee
malts
the
dark
fruits
are
picked
up
along
with
some
cherries
and
bitter
orange
peel
mouth
is
medium
sticky
and
bit
hot
overall
a
bit
unbalanced
and
hot
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
have
it
again
maybe
with
a
year
or
two
on
it
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
brown
sugar
molasses
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
i
also
get
some
caramel
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
piney
hops
there
is
also
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
warming
in
the
beer
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
nice
barleywine
notes
it
seems
to
me
that
this
bottle
might
be
past
its
prime
or
that
the
alcohol
burn
is
way
out
of
whack
a
light
american
style
or
perhaps
english
style
barley
wine
not
the
greatest
but
a
soso
attempt
still
if
you
like
maltcentric
beers
this
is
probably
worth
trying
pours
a
murky
orange
with
some
reddish
tints
a
nice
bit
of
offwhite
head
smells
a
bit
hoppy
and
sweet
lots
of
nice
malt
on
the
nose
tastes
very
sweet
and
malty
the
hops
are
very
minimal
overall
not
very
impressive
definitely
had
much
barleywines
notes
nothing
remarkable
here
at
least
not
for
me
and
something
that
i
would
rather
not
recommend
neither
for
those
in
love
with
fresh
american
versions
of
the
style
or
those
preferring
deeper
maltier
takes
let
alone
offering
this
as
an
entry
point
for
barley
wines
sorry
and
the
overblown
bragging
on
the
label
dressing
the
bottle
does
not
help
ill
be
game
to
try
it
again
in
the
future
though
aged
or
under
a
different
incarnation
thanks
to
ratman
for
bringing
this
one
over
to
the
house
last
weekend
2007
vintage
poured
a
slightly
hazy
caramel
color
with
a
short
white
head
aromas
of
prunes
caramel
and
dark
fruits
full
bodied
and
very
smooth
with
caramel
dark
fruits
and
sherry
pours
rusty
orange
thin
white
head
smells
of
wheat
sort
of
like
a
bock
floral
and
metallic
aromas
taste
is
metallic
hoppy
florals
phenolic
medicinal
thin
mouthfeel
high
carbonation
pretty
disappointing
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
glad
to
have
tried
it
though
atmosphere
is
pretty
solid
deep
amber
color
great
foamy
head
and
very
nice
lacing
nose
is
a
little
malt
with
great
sweet
tones
flavor
is
hearty
woody
and
a
little
sweet
great
balance
and
body
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
i
split
this
bottle
with
a
couple
of
buddies
and
drank
it
with
dessert
and
think
that
made
the
drinkability
on
this
very
nice
seems
more
like
an
english
barleywine
to
me
an
alright
beer
for
a
cold
night
feels
a
bit
flat
too
nothing
really
stands
out
here
for
the
abv
its
easy
drinking
i
just
got
a
bit
bored
with
it
im
pretty
impressed
with
what
i
believe
is
my
first
beer
from
new
mexico
chicken
killer
is
quite
a
flavorful
american
barleywine
thats
mild
mannered
and
relatively
balanced
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
in
the
hop
department
but
thats
my
preference
for
the
style
for
those
who
like
their
american
barleywines
more
balanced
check
out
chicken
killer
youll
likely
enjoy
it
awesome
an
american
barleywine
that
is
not
hopped
to
the
hilt
refreshing
to
see
a
balanced
barleywine
that
does
not
have
to
rely
on
extremes
hooray
for
balance
a
pleasure
to
sip
nice
medium
sized
head
faded
a
little
quick
for
my
liking
perfect
color
for
the
style
albeit
a
little
light
fills
the
nose
up
bread
like
qualities
nice
sweet
aromas
but
a
touch
too
much
alcohol
in
the
nose
taste
is
the
strong
point
here
everything
i
need
in
an
american
barleywine
is
perfectly
balanced
nice
layering
of
the
malt
hops
then
back
to
malt
with
each
sip
good
mouthfeel
as
well
a
beer
you
can
chew
as
fits
the
style
nice
job
with
this
one
d
i
wont
drink
this
again
d
this
is
not
my
favorite
barleywine
but
i
certainly
would
not
be
opposed
to
drinking
it
again
some
time
d
id
drink
it
over
some
other
stuff
but
probably
wont
buy
it
again
some
chill
haze
at
first
but
it
clears
up
and
reveals
an
amber
liquid
with
a
light
white
head
not
much
sticking
to
the
glass
smell
is
rich
and
full
sweet
alcohol
and
toffee
taste
is
kind
of
the
same
with
a
good
balance
of
firmly
bitter
grapefruit
hops
a
bit
of
warm
fresh
brown
bread
some
notes
of
leather
tobacco
and
wood
in
the
finish
with
touch
of
vanilla
while
not
hidden
the
alcohol
is
well
integrated
into
the
taste
feel
is
somewhat
slick
and
syrupy
with
a
gentle
carbonation
some
warming
from
the
alcohol
as
well
goes
down
nicely
a
nice
well
balanced
barley
wine
this
ale
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
some
reddish
highlights
and
thin
white
fizzy
head
on
the
nose
i
find
you
get
a
good
amount
of
barley
mixed
with
some
hops
with
notes
caramel
vanilla
red
berry
fruit
and
citrus
the
palate
shows
a
nice
sweetness
from
the
barley
up
front
but
balances
out
with
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
as
you
progress
d
drinkability
is
good
for
the
chicken
killer
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
this
one
and
have
to
say
its
pretty
solid
it
could
use
something
what
that
something
is
i
cant
really
tell
hops
i
dont
think
so
the
big
malty
profile
seems
to
work
9
instead
off
10
not
really
the
alcohol
never
gets
too
warm
to
take
anything
away
from
the
brew
anyway
you
look
at
it
its
good
glad
i
got
to
try
it
out
but
im
not
sure
id
seek
it
out
again
given
the
obvious
new
mexico
ohio
distro
hurdle
overall
drinkability
3
5
aiming
for
a
hopheads
barley
wine
it
doesnt
quite
hit
the
mark
mainly
because
of
the
strong
unpleasant
yeast
note
that
stands
out
i
would
prefer
a
better
balance
between
malt
and
hop
personally
i
find
this
one
too
hopfocused
pretty
drinkable
but
i
find
other
bws
a
lot
more
enjoyable
d
chicken
killer
is
certainly
a
big
beer
but
its
well
balanced
the
tiniest
sip
seems
to
fill
the
whole
mouth
however
the
fusels
and
hot
burning
alcohol
flavors
are
too
much
and
finishing
a
bomber
singlehanded
is
a
lofty
task
mediumlow
drinkability
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
example
of
a
barleywine
not
sure
about
it
being
a
revolutionary
beer
that
will
someday
define
americas
barleywine
style
but
it
is
very
drinkable
for
fans
of
the
bigger
cheaper
beers
too
bad
still
a
decent
enough
beer
but
something
happened
to
the
chicken
killer
that
derailed
it
from
its
intended
path
love
to
try
this
on
tap
or
without
the
funk
i
bet
its
much
better
drinkability
this
was
an
good
but
i
wasnt
wowed
by
any
of
the
aspects
the
beer
had
to
offer
good
allaround
yeah
thats
about
it
d
no
on
the
drinkability
tarty
fruuityness
plus
the
boozeahol
are
a
bit
much
this
one
is
really
more
of
a
wine
than
a
beer
as
the
name
and
the
style
implies
overall
this
is
a
barleywine
thats
not
worth
buying
unless
overall
as
a
big
beer
its
pretty
decent
but
as
an
american
barley
wine
it
misses
the
mark
needs
to
be
sweeter
hoppier
and
needs
more
body
meh
oh
and
for
the
record
i
have
known
a
few
chicken
killers
and
can
vouch
they
take
no
hostages
find
no
nourishment
and
seek
only
to
decimate
the
flock
santa
fe
may
have
been
aiming
for
this
with
the
alcohol
but
a
true
chicken
killer
is
significantly
more
rabid
oh
bummer
its
so
not
a
barleywine
no
body
no
bitterness
no
sweetness
bummer
with
all
they
say
they
put
into
it
twice
the
ingredients
for
half
the
extraction
sounds
to
me
like
four
times
the
concentration
they
could
have
done
so
much
more
in
particular
it
needs
to
be
sweeter
and
more
bitter
it
also
needs
more
body
this
is
like
drinking
andygator
not
so
bad
in
and
of
itself
i
guess
or
as
a
belgian
something
or
other
but
not
to
style
and
not
interesting
dthis
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
very
one
dimesional
i
hate
to
catergorize
a
barley
wine
as
weak
but
this
is
it
no
date
on
bottle
ruby
red
with
thick
frothy
head
after
a
vigorous
pour
minimal
head
after
that
smell
is
pear
and
apple
seems
to
lack
that
patented
brown
sugar
smell
so
many
other
bws
have
its
there
but
has
no
back
bone
taste
is
dark
fruits
some
brown
sugar
the
pear
and
apple
from
the
nose
bitterness
is
there
in
the
finish
but
not
a
good
hoppy
finish
its
rather
metallic
coppery
the
metal
flavor
is
more
pronounced
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
chewy
sticky
nicely
carbed
drinkability
is
low
the
alcohol
content
and
the
strange
metallic
taste
made
finishing
the
bomber
a
real
struggle
i
was
impressed
by
the
brew
i
will
assume
the
age
did
nothing
but
help
it
in
my
scores
as
well
there
were
no
hops
present
in
this
thing
at
all
and
the
alcohol
was
hidden
extremely
well
by
the
flavors
and
aromas
i
enjoyed
every
drop
of
my
glass
i
even
saw
a
craft
beer
noob
grab
the
bottle
to
wring
the
last
few
drops
from
it
i
guess
we
have
a
convert
drinkability
middle
of
the
road
barleywine
that
lacks
complexity
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
bw
that
doesnt
really
stand
out
in
any
way
not
bad
but
nothing
memorable
overall
this
is
a
solid
barleywine
thats
somewhere
in
between
an
american
and
english
worth
a
shot
d
the
flavors
are
a
bit
soft
and
one
dimensional
and
the
plastic
aroma
covers
up
most
other
smells
i
finished
the
bottle
but
it
was
a
but
drab
to
get
through
all
in
all
an
interesting
barleywine
but
finishing
even
part
of
the
bomber
is
a
bit
of
a
chore
the
alcohol
strength
is
overhwelming
at
times
possibly
just
too
fresh
and
hot
maybe
a
year
would
do
wonders
the
alcohol
just
creates
a
bit
of
a
funky
flavor
profile
that
doesnt
quite
jive
with
me
making
it
one
that
id
hesitate
to
try
again
maybe
its
just
an
off
bottle
ill
definitely
give
it
another
try
in
the
future
but
for
the
moment
not
a
standout
by
any
means
pours
a
dark
hazy
reddish
amber
with
a
super
creamy
light
tan
head
smell
is
very
malty
and
of
alcohol
taste
is
super
sweet
a
lot
of
maltose
here
as
well
as
carmel
and
biscuits
bitterness
is
only
to
balance
as
the
super
malt
flavor
overwhelms
but
in
a
good
way
there
is
also
an
interesting
hop
flavor
as
well
mouthfeel
is
super
creamy
nice
smooth
carbonation
not
very
drinkable
though
half
of
a
22oz
bomber
is
plenty
the
super
sweet
taste
is
good
but
gets
cloying
after
about
10oz
the
alcohol
starts
to
bite
at
that
point
too
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
though
as
it
is
nice
to
have
a
nonsuper
hoppy
barleywine
for
once
pours
a
medium
dark
amber
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
sweet
malts
lots
of
caramel
some
toffee
slight
citrus
hops
taste
is
a
bit
citrus
and
caramel
not
a
whole
lot
of
depth
here
certainly
tasty
but
kind
of
one
dimensional
body
is
a
little
thin
for
the
style
carbonation
is
medium
mouthfeel
is
creamysyrupy
alcohol
is
certainly
well
hidden
nothing
offensive
here
certainly
tasty
but
there
are
much
better
barleywines
out
there
thanks
daniel
i
have
one
more
of
these
that
is
about
a
year
old
and
will
probably
age
it
for
another
6
months
or
so
im
glad
i
got
to
try
a
fresh
version
but
this
guy
could
use
some
time
in
the
bottle
to
mesh
the
flavors
it
seems
like
a
little
of
a
mashup
right
now
despite
the
fact
that
i
think
it
needs
a
little
more
body
this
is
a
pretty
darn
drinkable
bottle
of
barleywine
style
ale
opinion
i
am
not
sure
that
i
really
like
the
sensation
associated
with
drinking
this
beer
it
is
odd
how
it
goes
down
but
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
will
be
letting
it
warm
up
over
quite
some
time
so
it
is
changes
significantly
i
may
go
back
and
amend
this
review
this
was
an
alright
beer
but
i
would
sure
take
a
number
of
other
barley
wines
over
this
one
from
the
bomber
into
the
pint
glass
at
room
temperature
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
deep
copper
color
with
a
meager
offwhite
cover
and
solid
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
weak
just
a
hint
of
wheat
and
malt
maybe
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
a
fairly
high
octane
grape
with
wheaty
mild
malt
ham
and
pepper
it
grows
on
you
a
bit
but
it
is
not
very
well
balanced
medium
bodied
with
lively
fine
carbonation
not
very
drinkable
in
my
book
the
flavor
is
too
scant
and
nondescript
to
sustain
the
alcohol
harshness
some
butterscotch
and
licorice
worth
a
try
but
keep
it
room
temperature
and
give
it
a
chance
to
mellow
on
the
taste
buds
pours
with
a
large
tight
peach
hued
head
despite
the
large
head
beer
is
quite
flat
clear
deep
copper
color
aroma
is
light
like
fresh
baked
bread
with
brown
sugar
and
ethanol
first
sip
is
of
alcohol
middle
is
like
alcohol
and
some
brown
sugar
end
is
like
alcohol
tastes
strongly
of
alcohol
some
hint
of
raisins
and
bitterness
in
finish
along
with
alcohol
did
i
mention
the
alcohol
seems
a
lot
stronger
than

diminutive
small
spots
of

behind
upon
closer

notes
of

dark

arise
to

noted
on

at

is
medium
to
full

with
a
generous

wheat
and
a
fair
amount
of

wrapping
it
all
up
not
a
bad
barley
wine
at
all
i
love
getting
beers
like
this
in
the
mail
because
there
is
no
other
way
i
would
ever
get
to
try
it
but
i
wont
be
trying
it
again
in
fact
im
going
to
have
another
celebration
ale
to
wash
this
out

thick

no

caramel

butterscotch
in

oily

taste
did
not
live
up

caramel

with
some
graininess
and
a
rotten

flavor
that
well
doesnt
belong
in
beer
there
are
far
better
out
there
wow
this
is
the
first
barey
wine
i
have
ever
tried
and
its
pretty
overwhelming
that
said
its
not
altogether
unpleasant
it
pours
a
cloudy
light
brown
smells
of
deep
carmel
with
woody
notes
the
taste
is
very
rich
but
with
a
wonderful
array
of
flavors
at
first
there
is
the
very
strong
malty
sweetness
along
with
fruit
wood
and
carmal
flavors
this
isnt
a
beer
you
can
crack
open
for
a
barbeque
but
its
a
very
intersting
experience
overall
an
enjoyable
barley
wine
that
i
am
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
i
would
say
this
would
be
worth
another
look

festival
dunedin
fl
2002
vintage
this
one
had
a
milder
hop
aroma
the
flavor
was
very
good
with
a
bit
stronger
dark
fruit
note
and
smoother
hops
very
drinkable
this
is
a
really
nice
barley
wine
the
color
is
a
dark
and
cloudy
amber
the
smell
is
slightly
sweet
and
very
much
in
keeping
with
barley
wines
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
excellent
a
nice
caramel
taste
with
low
carbonation
you
really
cant
tell
that
its
10
alcohol
the
brew
is
also
feels
thicker
than
a
regular
beer
and
has
a
nice
finish
definitely
would
order
one
again
a
most
drinkable
barleywine
nicely
balanced
with
the
caramel
malting
and
the
normal
barleywine
tastesome

this
one
will
transition
people
to
barleywines

with
good

delight

with

head
smells
sweet
with
a

not
an
overly
complex
barleywine
but
something
new
to
the
category
could
handle
this
is
a
very
surprising
hit
for
me
lots
of
wonderful
malt
and
the
drinkability
cant
be
beat
for
the
style
this
ranks
as
one
of
my
favorite
barleyines
now
pours
a
nice
cloudy
golden
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
tan
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
a
nice
touch
of
hops
some
slight
spices
the
taste
is
slighlty
sweet
malty
hoppy
and
a
touch
of
spice
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
very
nice
barleywine
d
rather
good
for
a
barleywine
i
put
down
the
entire
bomber
myself
reviewing
a
hometown
favorite
as
unbiasedly
as
possible
but
acknowledging
openly
that
i
have
a
will
like
this
beer
poured
out
of
the
bomber
into
my
glass
with
a
two
finger
khaki
colored
head
the
head
display
nice
retention
in
a
cobweb
like
way
and
it
does
lace
quite
well
the
brew
color
itself
is
wood
stain
brown
aromas
of
malts
and
ripened
fruits
flavors
are
sweet
and
the
alc
is
clearly
masked
purposefully
by
the
ondisplay
esters
fruit
flavors
most
notably
pineapple
in
the
middle
strong
malt
presence
and
at
the
end
enough
hop
presence
to
cut
with
out
doing
so
sharply
well
thought
out
but
not
subtle
still
i
do
consider
this
as
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
a
well
balanced
drinkable
barley
wine
if
you
can
find
you
have
to
try
it
whatever
you
do
drink
this
one
warm
above
60
o
took
this
to
a
great
party
this
ended
the
night
wasnt
overly
popular
but
a
good
one
to
curl
up
with
and
finish
the
evening
a
monster
brew
treat
it
seriously
d
scrumptious
the
alcohol
content
precludes
drinking
too
many
but
it
is
very
tasty
i
have
another
bottle
that
i
will
reluctantly
age
this
was
so
good
that
it
will
be
hard
to
keep
my
hands
off
of
it
taste
starts
with
some
herbal
hops
and
toasted
bread
malts
rummy
fruits
and
caramel
follow
hop
bitterness
escalates
with
a
piny
herbal
slightly
astringent
flavor
finishes
bitter
with
lingering
malt
sweetness
and
some
moderate
booziness
and
slight
astringency
mediumfull
body
with
a
creamy
feel
not
bad
but
either
it
doesnt
age
well
or
the
hops
need
to
be
worked
on
less
astringency
d
while
tasty
and
worth
trying
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
it
often
but
definitely
a
very
drinkable
barely
wine
drinkability
is
low
to
moderate
alcohol
is
high
and
flavors
are
sub
par
making
this
beer
a
little
more
difficult
to
consume
as
i
got
further
into
this
brew
and
it
warms
i
figured
out
the
problem
the
floral
hop
profile
just
doesnt
lend
itself
to
a
barleywine
its
more
of
an
offbalance
ipa
that
is
too
dark
had
they
used
a
different
hop
strain
they
probably
would
have
a
successful
brew
on
their
hands
d
after
a
hohum
review
by
ba
metalmonk
who
i
sent
a
bottle
to
i
decided
to
give
it
a
while
longer
resting
in
the
cellar
apparently
that
did
some
good
as
it
showed
up
as
a
drinkable
although
not
overly
exciting
barleywine
sippable
and
modeerately
worth
savoring
flavors
dont
wow
but
have
a
nice
layering
a
balanced
warmth
and
are
complex
enough
to
give
this
a
thumbs
up
good
effort
by
santa
fe
brewing
and
officially
my
first
new
mexican
brew
47th
to
the
union
39th
on
my
own
list
of
all
50
us
states
i
acquired
this
in
a
trade
from
turbine2475
thanks
for
the
chance
to
try
it
pours
dark
orange
with
some
ruby
highlights
the
head
fades
a
bit
but
settles
to
a
thin
cap
for
the
life
of
the
beer
smells
a
bit
sweet
and
a
bit
hot
a
tiny
bit
bready
and
with
some
spiced
pear
on
the
finish
the
taste
is
not
nearly
so
hot
and
the
flavors
are
more
integrated
than
is
indicated
by
the
nose
some
tangy
spicy
malt
earthy
hops
caramel
pear
honey
and
a
dry
finish
that
caps
it
off
nicely
fairly
dry
and
smooth
and
integrated
in
the
mouthfeel
pleasant
to
drink
but
you
can
definitely
feel
the
alcohol
creeping
up
on
you
d
this
is
deffinately
one
for
people
who
like
a
nice
english
style
barleywine
very
nice
example
that
i
would
recomend
deserves
its
name
pours
a
slightly
hazy
iced
tea
color
with
a
shallow
fizzy
orange
tan
colored
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
evidence
quite
a
bit
more
suspended
goodness
as
you
progress
to
the
inevitable
bottom
of
the
container
the
smell
is
also
unique
i
get
a
rich
malty
corn
starch
caramel
and
baked
vanilla
character
the
presence
of
alcohol
is
more
pronounced
as
this
beverage
warms
up
full
bodied
and
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
significantly
influenced
by
the
boozy
side
of
the
10
abv
i
find
the
taste
quite
enjoyable
exactly
what
the
doctor
ordered
tonight
had
this
one
on
the
wants
list
for
some
time
now
really
glad
that
i
found
it
at
whole
foods
in
arlingtontx
recommend
taking
it
for
a
ride
around
the
block
this
is
a
fully
flavored
beast
though
and
should
be
savored
at
just
the
right
temperature
just
the
right
occasion
sipped
slowly
and
shared
with
friends
style
is
generally
for
sipping
and
savoring
this
is
no
exception
prefer
abundance
of
flavor
to
provide
more
bankg
for
the
buck
this
is
by
no
means
unpleasant
but
does
not
deliver
desired
flavor
profile
maybe
a
little
time
in
the
cellar
will
allow
this
one
to
gel
a
bit
better
full
body
and
good
carbonation
a
nice
barley
wine
but
like
most
it
needs
a
fews
years
to
come
together
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
this
one
is
not
for
me
i
dont
know
if
its
the
warming
of
the
beer
or
the
10
abv
but
this
one
grows
on
you
i
started
out
thinking
it
was
a
little
harsh
but
about
halfway
through
the
beer
comes
together
nicely
add
that
to
a
creamy
mouthfeel
a
nice
bite
from
the
carbonation
and
spicy
hops
and
this
is
a
easy
drinker
with
some
character
mouthfeel
is
sweet
medium
bodied
with
doughy
yeast
hanging
on
through
the
finish

with

aroma
is
sweet
fruity
maltiness
taste
starts
with
plenty
of
sweetness
then
goes
a
bit
harsh
with
the
alcohol
in
the
middle
then
balances
somewhat
with
fruitiness
and
a
bit
of
numbing
at
the
close
mouthfeel
is
alright
a
little
bit
harsh
and
drinkability
is
okay
as
well
improving
as
it
warms
md
it
is
slowly
getting
harder
for
me
to
write
this
because
the
ale
was
so
drinkable
i
took
to
much
before
writing
and
now
the
10
abv
is
taking
effect
the
mouth
feel
is
thick
but
smooth
and
kinda
creamy
i
think
the
astringent
value
could
have
been
taperd
down
a
little
bit
but
it
is
still
good
the
drinkability
is
awesome

will
definitely

extremely

o
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
but
it
has
a
rye
spice
hop
bitterness
flavor
that
i
dont
typically
get
in
a
barley
wine
maybe
its
from
the
rye
barrels
and
the
addition
of
four
hops
and
the
dry
hopping
its
not
bad
but
there
are
better
barley
wines
out
there
even
non
ba
barley
wines
its
complex
but
it
is
not
smooth
and
easy
drinking
loved
the
scent
more
than
the
taste
but
it
is

didnt
notice
the

until
after
i
opened
it
shall
be
an
interesting
evening
overall
tasty
not
as
good
as
sucaba
wouldnt
buy
it
again
for
the
price
overall
a
great
beer
if
im
being
honest
i
have
a
bit
of
a
soft
spot
for
ba
barleywines
as
well
as
rye
whiskey
barrels
so
the
only
way
i
wasnt
going
to
like
this
one
was
if
it
was
pretty
bad
as
my
first
opportunity
trying
a
beer
from
hangar
24
im
certainly
curious
to
try
more
should
they
present
themselves
to
me
o
decent
example
of
the
style
it
is
certainly
a
very
sweet
and
boozy
barleywine
but
it
seems
like
such
a
chore
to
drink
in
comparison
to
the
better
rated
barrelaged
barleywines
out
there
id
suppose
id
say
its
fairly
messy
and
not
particularly
wellexecuted
o
huh
not
sure
how
to
score
this
one
i
swear
its
got
signs
of
oxidation
but
only
in
the
middle
and
lingering
between
sips
its
either
oxidation
or
some
sort
of
unfamiliar
hop
flavor
is
all
i
can
think
i
checked
through
the
reviews
and
there
were
several
mentions
of
oxidation
so
either
other
people
are
also
getting
tricked
or
theres
some
sort
of
odd
off
or
intended
flavor
in
this
its
really
not
that
bad
but
the
off
flavors
really
stood
out
for
me
they
just
really
clash
with
the
typical
barrelaged
barleywine
flavors
smooth
sweet
malty
overall
though
there
is
some
real
interesting
notes
and
character
here
no
complaints
an
outstanding
barrel
aged
barleywine
with
its
deep
rich
flavors
and
full
body
ive
been
thouroughly
impressed
with
the
couple
of
hangar
24s
barrel
roll
series
that
ive
been
fortunate
enough
to
receive
quality
stuff
that
deserves
a
try
edit
blue
cheese
cuts
the
sweetness
dramatically
if
thats
not
your
cup
of
tea
o
very
nice
barleywine
i
may
have
to
pick
up
another
bottle
when
i
go
back
to
vegas
next
month
o
few
flaws
pull
down
this
magnificent
beer
definitely
recommended
if
you
like

could
mellow
out
with
more
age
good
overall
o
very
good
i
would
compare
this
blighs
dry
dock
anyday
full
bodied
with
a
strong
barrel
character
and
plenty
of
spicy
booze
but
its
nicely
integrated
into
the
barleywine
flavors
strong
dry
oak
presence
with
lots
of
brandy
spicy
bourbon
vanilla
and
toasted
coconut
followed
by
leathery

caramel

alcohol
and
vinous
dark
fruit
notably
date
fig
and
plum
really
well
balanced
with
excellent
barrel

complex
and
flavorful
yet
very
easy
to
drink
considering
the
high
abv
slight
heat
and
warmth
in
the
finish
without
being
harsh
plenty
of
delicious
spirit
without
becoming
overwhelmingly
boozy
or
overpowering
excellent
c
o
id
buy
again
and
should
have
bought
two
so
i
could
put
one
down
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
some
thought
went
into
overall
very
nice
offering
would
definitely
age
well
but
this
is
enjoyable
fresh
o
it
seems
many
arent
a
fan
of
this
particular
brew
but
i
thought
it
was
really
interesting
mouthfeel
was
superb
and
it
was
spicy
as
hell
something
i
wasnt
expecting
the
zing
of
the
rye
whiskey
barrels
took
the
forefront
and
was
boosted
even
more
by
a
slightly
fruity
yet
bitter
hop
character
but
subtle
notes
of
bourbon
dark
fruits
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
caramel
allowed
this
beer
to
remain
amazingly
interesting
i
would
have
liked
more
from
the
nose
but
the
taste
was
unique
and
it
was
a
delight
to
drink
no
doubt
a
massive
alcohol
heat
to
it
and
i
am
sure
it
will
do
well
after
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
but
i
dont
mind
huge
beers
with
a
nice
heat
to
them
and
so
this
one
was
nothing
but
a
pleasure
to
sip
on
great
nightcap
after
one
too
many
cups
of
coffee
studying
for
midterms
mouthfeeloverall
mouthfeel
is
actually
very
pleasant
aside
from
the
highly
alcoholic
finish
right
at
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
and
very
smooth
drinking
overall
i
went
from
really
disliking
this
beer
to
warming
up
to
it
after
a
bit
to
dislike
again
too
much
alcohol
and
the
citrus
hops
were
not
complemented
well
by
the

cheers
o
a
hopped
up
carmel
heavy
and
stronge
bourbon
bw
o
ive
heard
theres
some
bottle
variation
with
hangar
24
so
im
hoping
thats
the
case
here
id
like
to
revisit
in
the
near
future
o
just
a
ok
ba
barleywine
i
dont
know
why
brewers
dry
hop
ba
beers
it
doesnt
work
well
with
the
barrel
aging
stop
it
my
first
taste
of
hangar
15
though
this
didnt
live
up
to
the
henryesque
nose
its
very
good
odd
but
very
good
pours
a
murky
dark
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
fruit
wood
and
bourbon
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
woody
finish
and
a
bourbon
kick
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
i
think
this
one
smells
better
fuller
medium
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
i
enjoyed
the
heavyhanded
hopping
on
this
one
and
the
blend
of
rye
and
bourbon
barrel
aging
was
a
nice
touch
as
well
very
enjoyable
middle
to
the
road
ba
barleywine
glad
i
tried
it
would
have
again
but
wouldnt
seek
out
thanks
supeonadeuces
o
overall
solid
ba
barleywine
nothing
earth
shattering
but
pretty
smooth
for
such
a
big
beer
this
one
could
use
some
mellowing
out
still
though
not
my
favorite
but
there
is
potential
fresh
it
is
a
bit
unrefined
and
flavors
dont
meld
quite
as
much
as
id
like
but
if
the
spice
fade
the
booze
integrates
a
bit
better
and
the
rich
toffee
and
caramel
come
out
a
bit
more
with
age
which
are
all
things
i
could
see
happening
with
this
itll
be
good
down
the
line
so
hold
onto
these
for
a
bit
longer
enjoyable
now
but
i
could
see
this
being
much
better
in
six
months
almost
mahogany
in
color
with
minimal
head
the
nose
is
somewhat
boozy
lots
of
bourbon
wood
and
vanilla
but
good
caramel
and
toffee
too
quite
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
as
well
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
boozy
as
expected
a
nice
dark
fruit
aroma
brown
sugar
toffee
and
caramel
good
barrel
charter
of
bourbon
and
vanilla
not
that
much
wood
though
o
enjoyable
but
i
think
a
6
oz
serving
was
plenty
this
needs
23
years
of
aging
for
sure
dont
open
until
2015
o
it
was
pretty
good
all
around
and
was
way
better
than
the
bottled
version
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
style
as
the
rye
barrels
presumably
are
what
create
many
of
the
spiciness
coming
through
there
is
a
little
bit
of
the
flavor
that
i
find
to
be
a
little
light
from
the
body
but
it
really
is
a
very
good
beer
the
spicy
fruit
notes
are
very
unique
this
beer
pours
a
dirty
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
the
nose
is
very
interesting
it
features
bourbon
and
spicy
whiskey
aka
the
rye
but
it
has
a
lot
of
red
fruit
to
it
namely
slight
cherry
and
a
whole
lot
of
grape
its
actually
pretty
vinous
the
flavors
are
very
sweet
and
a
little
aggressive
i
get
a
lot
of
red
wine
notes
paired
with
toffee
oak
grape
and
vanilla
its
a
little
harsh
and
the
alcohol
is
definitely
present
it
has
a
distinct
grape
character
overall
its
not
bad
just
not
spectacular
it
drinks
a
little
boozy
and
coats
your
palate
as
it
should
overall
this
is
decent
and
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
overall
i
like
this
beer
its
a
solid
ba
barleywine
i
made
the
mistake
of
pouring
it
into
a
kuhnhenn
tulip
though
this
smells
something
like
kuhnhenns
bourbon
barrel
fourth
dementia
but
just
cant
live
up
to
the
comparison
still
good
though
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
definitely
that
of
a
barrelaged
beer
i
get
a
lot
of
bourbon
and
whiskey
notes
as
well
as
some
toffee
caramel
brown
sugar
and
molasses
the
flavor
is
also
very
nice
i
get
some
pine
from
the
hops
as
well
as
some
brown
sugar
molasses
caramel
malt
and
whiskey
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
very
nice
in
a
word
disappointing
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
with
carbonation
being
a
little
on
the
high
side
overall
it
was
a
pretty
solid
beer
but
not
quite
great
the
bitter
resiny
american
hop
profile
was
a
little
strong
and
the
bourbon
barrel
a
little
light
pretty
good
overall
though
overall
i
expected
a
pretty
good
beer
when
i
heard
about
this
because
i
enjoyed
the
other
beers
in
this
series
im
relieved
i
didnt
buy
a
bottle
of
this
i
dont
know
if
it
was
this
particular
bottle
or
the
beer
in
general
but
this
was
terrible
everyone
dumped
it
out
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
ba
barleywine
this
was
a
first
from
hangar
24
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
doa
o
sipped
this
badboy
on
a
cold
night
in
san
diego
perfect
for
warming
up
your
tongue
tastes
like
they
were
able
to
leech
out
some
of
that
devils
cut
in
those
rye
whiskey
barrels
brilliant
and
tasty
beer
d
not
a
session
but
so
tasty
05182013
update
had
the
2013
version
12
4
on
tap
at
california
kebabs
first
anniversary
boozy
and
alcoholic
with
a
serious
whiskey
taste
there
is
a
dry
sensation
that
is
closer
to
a
belgian
style
a
bitter
edge
takes
the
sweetness
down
so
boozy
its
like
a
dry
liqueur
thin
with
too
much
hop
character
and
not
enough
malt
dssapointing
given
how
much
ive
enjoyed
other
hotd
beers
this
honestly
felt
like
a
shitty
attempt
at
a
barleywine
homebrew
not
a
great
start
to
hair
of
the
dog
ugh
depends
on
the
year
eh
overall
i
would
say
it
is
kind
of
flat
but
i
like
it
too
much
to
say
that
hotd
makes
great
beer
i
will
have
it
again

to

looks
like
diarrhea
to
be
quite
honest
and
smells
vaguely
barley
wineish
taste
isnt
awful
but
its
certainly
not
good
a
weird
plasticy
aspect
to
this
that
doesnt
sit
well
and
still
looking
at
it
is
giving
me
the
willies
bottle
says
its
a
2013
in
case
anyone
cares
perhaps
beyond
my
current
palate
but
i
dont
think
so
it
looked
smelled
and
tasted
bad
like
medicine
or
some
kind
of
staleinfected
cider
more
than
beer
still
i
recognize
im
in
the
minority
on
this
verdict
maybe
youll
love
it
edit
refers
to
2014
batch
which
may
have
had
issues
in
general
good
earthy
and
rich
american
barleywine
flavors
but
it
is
surrounded
by
too
much
sticky
sweetness
o
an
average
american
style
barley
wine
not
very
well
balanced
maybe
in
3
years
the
hops
would
have
dropped
out
some
but
here
and
now
not
very
pleasing
and
i
like
barley
wines
o
ive
had
it
aged
and
now
fresh
and
its
world
class
either
way
what
a
great
beer
worth
finding
and
aging

drinking
fresh
lots
of
complexity
if
not

could
use

tasting
thanks
for
the
opportunity
rich
caramel
light
pitted

mild
oxidation
a
10
year
old
bottle
that
held
up
better
than
my
previous
2
attempts
with
newer
vintages
o
really
good
but
everything
i
have
by
them
makes
me
want
to
try
their
from
the
wood
beers
i
dont
think
i
can
say
much
more
about
this
beer
than
ive
already
said
nowhere
as
good
as
i
hoped
it
would
be
especially
considering
the
6
99
price
tag
on
a
12oz
bottle
very
smooth
and
a
nice
sipping
beer
though
my
first
beer
from
this
fabled
brewery
it
is
the
2011
vintage
and
marked
11
abv
on
the
12oz
bottle
its
hazy
and
caramel
colored
dense
looking
and
showing
less
than
an
inch
of
white
lazy
froth
i
smell
a
ton
of
toffee
sweet
english
malt
and
ale
yeast
not
dissimilar
from
so
many
other
traditional
barleywines
thick
and
syrupy
is
the
feel
but
the
alcohol
is
impressively
well
hidden
perhaps
this
beers
biggest
surprise
its
clearly
malt
forward
sweet
enough
for
any
palate
and
grounded
in
an
earthy
brown
butter
cream
type
of
desserty
vibe
that
makes
it
a
less
than
perfect
preprandial
libation
but
which
showcases
a
richness
and
simultaneous
delicacy
that
really
work
better
when
its
warm
and
still
tame
on
the
alcohol
front
this
is
a
well
done
beer
but
probably
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
which
i
sort
fo
expected
it
to
be
given
the
hype
on
this
brewery
or
at
least
a
few
of
its
beers
happy
with
it
not
overjoyed
overall
its
okay
got
a
little
too
much
of
the
sediment
in
the
glass
so
beware
when
you
pour
it
pours
a
hazy
deep
amber
capped
by
a
two
finger
off
white
head
plenty
of
pine
sap
caramel
toffee
and
hints
of
citrus
on
the
nose
big
caramel
malt
upfront
toffee
and
grainy
biscuit
accents
finishes
semidry
with
pine
sap
and
caramel
coated
grapefruit
and
citrus
rind
bitterness
moderate
carbonation
big
full
silky
yet
syrupy
body
slight
creaminess
on
the
finish
an
excellent
american
barleywine
the
hops
still
make
a
huge
statement
even
after
being
cellared
for
a
year
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
it
should
age
nicely
as
it
says
but
already
a
great
beer
overall
very
good
beer
but
not
exactly
a
great
beer
it
is
close
but
lacks
some
of
the
intense
complexity
and
presence
that
the
great
barleywines
have
definitely
worth
a
try
o
a
nice
hoppy
im
sure
much
hoppier
fresh
and
malty
barleywine
showcases
some
really
nice
and
complex
malt
notes
with
just
enough
hops
and
alcohol
to
cut
down
the
thickness
and
sweetness
well
balanced
to
boot
easily
the
best
hotd
beer
ive
had
to
date
i
really
am
enjoying
this
beer
couldnt
wait
another
month
to
pop
it
open
on
christmas
but
heres
to
a
late
celebration
of
life
for
my
2nd
son
honestly
after
a
stressful
few
weeks
and
a
few
more
to
come
hurdles
in
life
they
happen
this
is
a
fantastic
way
to
distract
the
mind
o
great
beer
the
age
has
really
mellowed
it
in
a
great
way
would
even
let
this
age
a
few
more
years
as
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
degraded
and
might
get
even
better
overall
a
bit
on
the
hot
and
heavy
side
but
pretty
tasty
o
this
definitely
got
better
as
the
beer
warmed
to
room
temperature
would
seek
out
again
and
prefer
to
try
a
younger
one
next
time
to
experience
some
of
the
hop
bitterness
this
was
on
the
sweeter
side
the
aroma
was
pretty
light
but
the
taste
made
up
for
the
shortfall
d
not
my
fav
of
the
style
with
the
slightly
flat
carbonation
and
higher
octane
does
bring
out
some
real
nice
malty
flavors
however
not
something
i
would
pick
up
often
makes
for
a
nice
seasonal
sipper
though
its
pretty
damned
good
im
looking
forward
to
aging
some
of
this
really
such
a
great
beer
probably
one
of
the
best
barleyywines
ive
ever
had
the
privilege
of
trying
thanks
gregg
for
a
sending
another
great
beer
now
im
going
to
hit
the
review
button
so
i
can
enjoy
the
last
ounce
or
two
remaining
drinkability
a
nice
very
drinkable
barleywine
mouthfeel
slightly
viscous
with
strong
residuals
overall
this
is
fantastic
the
best
american
style
barleywine
ive
had
there
is
a
big
fresh
hop
presence
but
does
not
over
power
overall
i
think
this
is
more
drinkable
than
the
fred
its
a
big
beer
and
one
that
i
could
have
only
a
few
of
also
it
seems
like
it
may
be
a
holiday
beer
in
which
case
i
could
see
it
pairing
well
with
heavy
holiday
foods
like
turkey
and
prime
ribthe
gameier
the
better
maybe
even
lamb
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sticky
but
i
have
only
really
came
across
one
cloying
beer
sneaky
pete
damn
good
barleywine
very
sweet
and
full
of
sugary
flavors
malts
fruits
and
just
straight
up
sugar
flirting
with
the
line
of
being
too
sweet
dont
know
if
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
but
split
between
our
tasting
group
the
sample
i
had
was
perfect
id
definitely
go
back
to
this
one
o
a
very
good
beer
not
an
everyday
beer
but
worth
picking
up
o
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
lives
up
to
its
reputation
once
again
like
all
american
barleywines
this
beer
greatly
improves
with
cellar
time
m
medium
to
full
body
very
light
carbonation
i
love
hair
of
the
dog
theyre
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
in
the
world
they
can
do
better
than
this
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
no
doubt
of
that
the
lack
of
carbonation
is
just
inexcusable
from
professional
brewers
especially
from
one
with
such
a
reputation
for
a
quality
product
very
disapointing
i
think
this
would
have
been
amazing
if
it
was
done
right
o
in
reading
the
other
reviews
on
here
it
appears
that
about
1
in
every
10
has
the
same
experience
i
did
not
sure
if
this
is
due
to
bottle
storage
i
drank
mine
just
a
few
days
after
delivery
or
if
i
just
drank
this
bottle
too
soon
but
its
definitely
one
of
the
stranger
beers
ive
ever
had
ive
got
about
half
a
bottle
left
and
i
cant
decide
if
ill
finish
it
update
dec
2013
still
awesome
overall
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
had
drinkable
balanced
delicious
not
sure
why
i
waited
to
long
to
open
one
will
be
buying
a
lot
more
of
these
from
now
on
glad
to
already
have
a
3year
vertical
going
cheers
o
good
barleywine
reminds
me
of
bigfoot
but
sweeter
and
better
o
this
is
my
second
time
having
this
beer
and
i
must
say
i
love
it
its
great
holiday
barleywine
and
by
far
one
of
the
best
american
style
barleywines
the
first
bottle
i
had
was
a
2010
so
it
had
two
years
of
age
on
it
it
was
a
more
balanced
with
less
bitterness
and
less
heat
from
the
alcohol
which
goes
to
show
that
this
beer
ages
gracefully
as
the
label
suggests
im
planning
on
doing
a
vertical
of
this
one
get
this
if
you
can
really
but
consider
cellaring
a
few
i
think
i
need
to
try
another
bottle
in
reading
the
other
reviews
other
than
one
that
seemed
to
have
the
same
issue
i
did
this
looks
like
a
tasty
brew
i
couldnt
get
over
the
feel
thick
no
carbonation
whatsoever
no
head
at
all
the
taste
was
good
but
i
didnt
get
the
right
experience
and
i
didnt
finish
the
glass
d
yeah
its
a
solid
american
barleywine
here
in
its
super
fresh
state
absolutely
need
to
try
an
aged
version
to
see
how
it
transforms
this
is
a
great
barleywine
i
might
be
a
bit
biased
as
i
really
enjoy
barleywines
but
this
one
is
definitely
one
of
my
preferred
ones
that
isnt
barrel
aged
i
can
only
imagine
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
version
of
this
case
in
point
i
think
this
rivals
sn
bigfoot
one
of
the
best
hoppy
barleywines
o
hoppy
and
a
bit
unbalanced
at
first
then
it
warms
to
almost
room
temperature
and
i
am
in
heaven
great
beer
overall
this
brew
has
potential
but
suffers
from
a
lack
of
complexity
and
no
carbonation
getting
harder
to
find
this
one
as
hotd
is
scarce
in
in
anymore
but
i
love
the
various
stages
of
this
beer
bright
and
hoppy
in
its
youth
after
about
a
year
this
one
is
more
of
a
boozy
english
style
barleywine
at
this
stage
o
a
very
nice
and
hoppy
barleywine
can
only
imagine
what
happens
to
this
beer
over
time
can
see
it
being
a
very
interesting
beer
to
vertical
overall
great
beer
hotd
impresses
yet
again
some
might
say
this
is
too
hoppy
for
the
style
but
thats
fine
with
me
lots
of
hops
in
this
one
but
the
barleywine
malt
base
shines
through
nicely
as
well
a
slightly
heavier
palate
here
and
youd
have
a
real
monster
thanks
again
for
the
chance
at
this
boozecamel
this
was
excellent
d
very
drinkable
big
rich
and
bold
malt
character
but
the
body
and
hop
really
balance
out
nicely
fantastic
barleywine
o
fantastic
i
liked
every
part
of
this
beer
i
havent
tried
many
barleywines
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
i
have
tried
so
far
worth
the
try
worth
the
buy
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
o
really
good
beer
complex
flavors
that
were
very
well
balanced
very
sweet
without
going
overboard
stayed
thoroughly
delicious
throughout
the
entire
glass
would
love
to
have
it
again
good
barleywine
great
sweetness
and
nice
hop
balance
an
excellent
barleywine
though
in
my
opinion
its
somewhere
between
a
typical
american
and
english
maybe
its
that
theyve
faded
since
it
was
brewed
but
i
didnt
get
big
hop
character
overall
this
beer
is
extremely
smackable
glad
i
picked
it
up
when
i
had
the
opportunity
o
a
dangerously
drinkable
fullflavored
barleywine
one
of
my
favorites
from
hotd
o
fantastic
beer
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
had
certainly
one
of
the
best
ones
fresh
its
so
balanced
and
mellow
id
definitely
recommend
it
o
highly
recommended
an
excellent
beer
and
one
of
the
better
barleywines
drinkable
interesting
hefty
and
rewarding
o
one
of
if
not
the
best
nonba
barleywine
ive
had
probably
the
best
please
please
put
this
in
a
barrel
o
one
of
the
better
barleywines
out
there
fresh
or
aged
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
cheers
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
barleywine
its
smooth
and
deep
and
cohesive
im
super
impressed
with
how
well
hair
of
the
dog
beers
react
to
the
aging
process
i
wish
i
had
more
hotd
bottles
to
subject
to
even
longer
ageing
spells
on
tap
straight
from
the
source
2011
vintage
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
with
an
inch
of
head
lots
of
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
with
some
toffee
dark
fruits
and
earth
taste
echoes
the
aroma
sweet
toffee
dark
fruits
and
earthiness
warming
alcohol
is
very
present
sweet
chocolatey
finish
not
overly
boozey
and
well
balanced
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
solid
barleywine
worth
having
again
o
wow
this
one
even
surprised
me
i
must
say
this
beer
is
drinking
offthechain
right
now
if
you
have
a
2004
or
so
bottle
open
it
and
enjoy
glad
i
have
more
d
o
overall
an
ok
beer
but
not
overly
enjoyable
i
can
see
a
barrel
treatment
doing
wonders
for
this
beer
i
remember
having
one
with
a
few
years
of
age
on
it
and
that
seemed
to
mellow
and
integrate
the
flavors
much
better
it
seems
to
be
in
a
bit
of
an
awkward
stage
6mo
out
or
so
m
its
full
but
not
as
big
and
chewy
as
i
was
expecting
again
its
like
a
big
malty
west
coast
dipa
very
nice
deep
copper
pour
with
a
ridiculously
blooming
head
that
takes
up
most
of
the
glass
and
takes
forever
to
recede
aroma
of
stewed
red
and
brown
fruits
with
a
resinous
background
taste
of
caramel
toffee
candy
sugar
resin
plum
cherry
kumquat
datefig
and
even
a
bit
of
kiwi
very
resinous
almost
endless
finish
body
is
somewhat
syrupy
but
not
overly
so
definitely
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
sampled
overall
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
more
but
it
definitely
lacks
some
complexity
sweet
boozy
and
a
little
uninteresting
as
for
their
doggie
claws
its
a
nice
beer
thats
got
a
bunch
of
warts
if
theyd
take
the
time
to
touch
this
up
and
give
it
a
bit
of
tlc
this
could
be
great
as
it
is
its
just
ok
overall
i
did
enjoy
this
i
had
a
little
higher
expectations
for
it
but
am
very
thankful
to
matttyce
for
the
chance
at
this
a
must
try
for
any
beer
geek
o
an
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
barleywine
is
always
great
the
booze
isnt
noticeable
at
all
and
the
flavors
are
pretty
solid
ive
got
another
one
in
the
cellar
and
am
excited
for
what
a
year
or
two
will
do
to
this
as
id
like
to
see
the
carbonation
die
down
and
the
hops
ease
back
a
bit
sweet
hoppy
caramely
boozy
then
slightly
hoppy
again
to
finish
this
one
aged
quite
well
really
enjoyed
it
body
is
mediumfull
theres
practically
no
carbonation
left
giving
it
a
slick
sticky
syrupy
texture
lasting
flavor
is
herbal
bitterness
some
good
flavors
in
here
curious
to
see
how
an
aged
bottle
would
compare
to
a
fresh
one
all
in
all
a
solid
drinking
experience
a
pleasant
intro
to
hair
of
the
dog
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
with
carbonation
being
almost
nonexistent
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
of
the
style
i
really
liked
what
the
honey
added
to
it
and
it
was
very
smooth
for
the
abv
as
well
very
solid
beer
but
it
just
didnt
really
wow
me
like
some
of
the
best
of
the
style
do
4
4

o
a
real
nice
beer
and
so
easy
to
drink
i
know
that
i
am
nagging
now
but
a
bit
colder
would
have
been
nice
doa
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
medium
redorange
amber
with
a
one
finger
fine
to
medium
white
head
nice
retention
and
massive
lacing
looks
great
fantastic
aroma
of
herbal
hops
and
sweet
malt
light
fruit
wonderful
complex
flavor
dominated
by
herbal
and
citrus
hops
with
a
solid
sweet
malt
body
and
dark
and
light
fruits
and
honey
finishes
nicely
with
malt
and
a
hop
kick
creamy
medium
body
very
well
made
and
tasty
this
2010
bottle
was
perfectly
carbonated
no
sign
of
the
over
carbonation
reported
by
others
for
2010
definatly
one
of
the
better
american
barleywines
ive
had
similar
to
bigfoot
only
with
some
better
complexities
i
would
love
to
try
this
aged
or
out
of
a
bourbon
barrel
overall
a
great
barleywine
with
a
lot
of
complexity
that
i
am
sure
would
only
become
more
pronounced
with
age
pours
a
yellow
brown
color
which
i
found
a
little
odd
the
beer
is
hazy
brown
but
when
held
to
light
gives
a
yellow
color
the
head
is
mellow
rising
to
about
1
finger
in
my
snifter
lots
of
carbonation
can
be
seen
the
smell
is
close
to
a
dipa
smell
strong
nose
of
grapefruit
raisin
alcohol
taste
starts
with
thick
malt
sweetness
and
alcohol
then
i
get
a
touch
of
fruitiness
maybe
like
a
applestrawberry
toward
the
end
of
the
taste
i
get
a
smooth
malt
that
eases
into
a
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
ticklish
carbonation
this
is
a
really
great
barleywine
i
enjoy
the
assertive
hops
and
the
sweetness
provided
by
the
honey
im
looking
to
tasting
this
again
in
a
few
years
result
in
the
future
im
not
aging
this
longer
than
1
year
i
dont
like
where
it
goes
this
ones
tasting
pretty
good
very
light
oxidation
with
plenty
of
plump
juicy
malt
and
some
shades
of
pine
still
coming
through
most
of
the
hops
have
faded
just
warming
booze
and
sticky
malt
for
the
most
part
a
hint
of
celery
seeds
oddly
step
forward
in
the
finish
as
the
beer
warms
this
beer
is
still
handsdown
way
better
fresh
this
vintage
is
holding
up
very
well
though
for
an
eight
year
old
o
this
one
was
incredibly
smooth
with
beer
at
2
years
aged
one
of
the
best
barley
wines
i
have
ever
enjoyed
next
to
aged
big
foot
way
more
fruit
flavors
though
then
caramel
notes
serve
in
a
glass
that
really
lets
the
aroma
out
its
quite
pleasant
d
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
seems
like
its
going
through
a
weird
phase
i
dont
mind
it
but
not
something
id
seek
out
again
at
least
not
right
now
3

beer
pours
a
cloudy
garnet
red
with
a
nice
two
finger
foam
head
while
the
head
dissipates
quickly
it
leaves
behind
copious
amounts
of
lacing
the
nose
is
a
lovely
blend
of
gentle
hops
lush
caramel
and
vanilla
and
a
decent
malt
background
i
also
detect
some
dark
fruit
plums
figs
and
such
the
taste
is
lovely
as
well
all
of
the
aforementioned
scents
are
detectable
on
the
palate
a
nice
conversion
from
nose
to
mouth
this
has
just
a
shade
of
sweetness
to
it
the
only
drawback
is
that
this
is
one
boozy
motherfucker
that
11
5
is
front
and
center
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
again
highlights
the
booziness
otherwise
its
quite
smooth
with
little
to
no
lingering
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
solid
barley
wine
and
one
that
id
visit
again
although
i
dont
envision
myself
throwing
up
and
iso
for
the
stuff
overall
my
first
offering
from
hotd
and
it
has
inspired
me
to
try
the
rest
of
their
beers
this
is
worth
tracking
down
especially
if
youre
a
barleywine
lover
i
think
im
going
to
grab
another
bottle
and
see
how
it
does
after
a
year
2009
bottle
drank
beside
the
2010
pours
a
rubycopper
with
a
small
head
the
nose
is
not
as
malt
aggressive
with
rich
tones
of
sap
red
apple
and
a
nice
malt
complexity
super
rich
silky
feel
in
the
mouth
flavor
has
a
lot
of
the
qualities
of
the
2010
but
in
a
far
more
refined
package
that
allows
the
burnt
sugars
toasted
marshmallow
to
shine
some
pine
sap
bitterness
on
the
finish
and
none
of
the
oxidation
of
the
2010
a
great
vintage

overall
i
really
enjoyed
my
pour
of
this
guy
i
cant
really
say
it
reminds
me
all
that
much
of
a
barleywine
because
of
how
hoppy
it
is
but
it
is
still
a
damn
good
beer
i
would
like
to
try
some
older
vintages
of
this
one
because
i
think
then
it
would
be
a
bit
more
like
the
barley
wines
that
i
have
come
to
love

d
i
think
i
should
give
this
a
go
fresh
or
aged
longer
i
think
i
might
have
drank
this
at
a
bad
time
oh
well
o
great
barleywine
will
enjoy
again
poured
a
nice
brownish
amber
with
a
small
cap
of

that
retained

well

smooth
and
nearly
fullbodied
very
drinkable
great
barleywine
overall
a
good
barley
wine
the
abv
is
well
hidden
very
drinkable
well
balanced
a
beautifully
aged
barleywine
that
is
just
solid
overall
so
glad
i
am
having
the
chance
to
enjoy
this
made
for
the
ages
this
beer
is
amazing
i
recently
had
a
2010
and
it
was
just
as
amazing
still
hoppy
but
everything
blended
together
even
more
this
is
a
magical
beer
im
going
back
tomorrow
to
buy
as
many
as
possible
to
drink
now
and
age
overall
i
really
do
enjoy
hair
of
the
dog
brewery
they
make
great
beers
in
styles
that
i
enjoy
as
far
as
doggie
claws
goes
its
a
really
nice
american
barleywine
probably
on
of
the
better
ones
have
had
while
i
still
prefer
the
english
style
barleywines
this
beer
holds
its
own
i
will
say
i
prefer
adam
over
this
beer
it
still
worth
a
try
for
any
fan
of
barleywines
darn
good
vintage
barleywine
mostly
american
but
a
bit
english

noticeable
improvement
after
a
year
not
gonna
change
any
scores
yet
but
ageing
nicely
this
beer
pours
a
light
to
medium
bodied
pure
copper
in
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
the
aromas
are
incredibly
malty
featuring
plenty
of
caramel
toffee
and
sweet
dried
fruits
with
a
citrusy
faded
hop
character
it
solid
and
to
he
expected
from
an
08
the
flavors
are
very
sweet
and
fruity
its
near
all
swerve
malts
i
get
a
lot
of
cherry
and
orange
peel
in
the
malt
bill
it
solid
and
has
nice
flavor
its
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
is
sticky
yet
not
overly
so
overall
this
is
a
nice
aged
barleywine
and
pretty
similar
to
the
08
behemoth
that
i
had
earlier
this
year
poured
out
as
a
deep
golden
brown
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
pretty
strong
smelling
it
had
a
lot
of
malts
and
hops
in
there
and
a
heavy
boozy
aroma
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
some
sweet
caramel
upfront
that
shifts
into
a
hoppy
bitter
finish
with
a
warming
alcohol
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
oily
and
has
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
big
beer
im
excited
to
try
it
again
one
day
possibly
have
it
again
after
aging
it
for
a
little
this
reminded
me
alot
of
fred
both
are
very
sweet
and
both
took
some
time
to
grow
on
me
quite
enjoyable
but
i
wouldnt
really
want
a
12oz
solo
has
that
hotd
feel
like
a
different
version
of
fred
sweet
and
hoppy
with
the
big
caramel
barleywine
body
o
a
great
mystique
to
this
brew
its
constantly
evolving
from
first
sip
to
last
never
disappointing
my
only
complaint
is
i
wish
i
had
another
nary
any
head
a
thin
ring
of
tan
head
surrounded
the
edge
of
the
glass
minimal
lacing
fairly
sweet
nose
some
dark
candi
sugar
huge
hop
notes
citrus
more
than
floral
i
detected
a
bit
of
rye
taste
is
hugely
hoppy
ala
fred
the
candi
sugar
is
fairly
pronounced
but
not
cloyingly
sweet
good
balance
mouthfeel
is
medium
decent
effervescence
leading
to
a
sticky
finish
the
abv
was
tamed
a
bit
in
this
aged
version
newer
bottles
can
run
a
wee
bit
hot
looking
forward
to
doing
a
vertical
tasting
of
this
special
holiday
offering
overall
this
is
such
a
fantastic
barleywine
both
aged
and
fresh
i
love
doggie
claws
but
the
2011
is
incredibly
well
done
smooth
and
lacking
in
alcoholic
heat
fantastic
o
i
still
give
the
edge
to
adam
but
this
is
both
tasty
and
infinitely
memorable

it

all
the
other
amazing
flavors
make
it
worth
it
on
th
bottle
it
says
theres
honey
from
mt
hood
which
i
instantly
thought
was
kind
of
a
bs
thing
because
usually
honey
just
gets

a
deep
this
pour
had
a
small
head
that
dissipated
to
a
fine
ring
but
it
surely
smelled
of
them
there
was
an
odd
flavor
combination
of
strong
whiskey
mixed
with
a
maple
syrup
and
a
touch
of
mentholated
cherry
to
finish
off
the
palate
this
was
still
on
the
boozy
side
even
with
the
age
there
was
almost
a
spruce

character
on
the
finish
of
this
beer

didnt

if

the
mouthfeel
was
absolutely
flat
not
very

the
flatness
made
this
harder
to
find
appealing
this
had
to
be
batch
specific
because
another

said
the

thing
but
its
so
much
more
intimate
bubblegum

i
say
its
a
great
hop
aroma
malts
are
solid

the

taste
alcohol
very
evident
not

but
damn
you
know
its
there
all
that
alcohol
tone
is
blended
within
copious
amounts
of
citrus
piney

with
rich
robust
malts

to

got
the

of

some

this

this

2002
edition
the
first
thing
i
noticed
about
this
beer
was
the
unusual
hop
aroma

stemming
i
suppose
from
the
rather
unusual
choice
of
hops
the
scent
is
mostly
herbal
with
a
bit
of
an
orange
citrusy
note
a
whiff
of
alcohol
makes
its
way
through
too
all
this
is
undergirded
by
a
subtle
caramel
malt
aroma
the
end
result
is
quite
terrific
and
improves
as
the
beer
sits
in
appearance
the
beer
has
a
light
copper
color
and
a
formidable
creamy
head
which
leaves
good
lacing
down
the
glass
the
flavor
struck
me
a
bit
harshly
theres
just
a
tiny
hint
of
sweetness
up
front
and
then
its
right
into
a
mostly
herbal
somewhat
medicinal
hopdominated
flavor
and
a
mild
alcohol
warming
building
to
what
struck
me
as
an
extremely
bitter
finish
medium
bodied
and
dry
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
improves
when
it
sits
id
like
to
set
one
of
these
away
for
a
year
or
so
and
see
how
it
smooths
out
comments
my
favorite
barley
wine
at
the
event
what
flavors
the
aftertaste
lasts
forever
oh
my
woof
woof
extremely
tasty
and
a
great
and
different
take
on
barleywine
a
unique
type
of
alcohol
in
general
like
a
magical
fruit
concoction

and
wasnt
even
aged
orangishcopper
in
color
with
a
thick
mountainous
head
with
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
is
herbal
alcoholic
fruity
and
somewhat
bready
the
flavor
is
alcoholic
throughout
it
attacks
the
whole
mouth
it
has
a
herbal
and
sweet
maltiness
like
that
of
candi
sugar
it
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
ale
i
even
detect
a
slight
fig
flavor
it
has
a
pecular
smell
that
i
have
never
smelt
before
it
must
be
the
choice
of
hops
in
this
one
it
was
my
first
barley
wine
of
the
year
and
i
found
it
to
be
extremely
complex
in
the
aromas
and
flavors
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
definitely
sample
again
2002
bottle
hooyeah
this
is
a
potent
beer
dark
murky
amber
color
with
an
insanely
thick
offwhite
head
as
with
other
hotd
beers
this
one
took
awhile
to
pour
aroma
of
hops
and
pepper
resonates
throughout
the
glass
definitely
has
some
imperial
ipa
qualities
in
the
flavor
with
strong
hops
alcohol
and
some
fruit
there
is
enough
malt
in
the
flavor
and
in
the
finish
to
balance
it
out
and
to
make
for
a
nice
seasonal

thanks
to
lt
bighuge
for
the
tour
of
duty
if
you
thought
fred
was
barley
wine
you
aint
seen
nothin
yet
i
got
a
sneek
peak
last
night
at
the
brewery
and
man
what
a
throughly
enjoyable
barley
wine
the
one
i
tried
had
already
been
aged
for
a
year
and
it
was
great
bold
up
front
hops
without
being
braceing
or
brash
with
substantial
malt
backing
sorry
about
not
being
more
spacific
but
allen
waited
until
later
in
the
evening
before
breaking
it
out
and
well
you
know
i
feel
sorry
for
those
of
you
to
far
away
to
get
some
maybe
next
y
little
bit
of
sediment
floating
around
pours
doo
doo
brown
in
color
taste
is
fantastic
malty
and
lots
of
barley
character
first
beer
i
had
in
vermont
on
my
vacation
last
week
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
water
as
is
sometimes
the
case
with
barleywines
overall
pretty
good
but
not
great
a
very
dark
barleywine
with
great
lacing
aromas
of
sweet
treacle
and
a
lot
of
hops
come
through
on
this
adding
resiny
citrus
and
pine
notes
a
satisfying
sipping
barleywine
with
a
really
great
complex
array
of
bready
malt
notes
coffee
a
subtle
sweetness
matched
by
a
serious
hop
contribution
very
nice
and
would
recommend
it
for
sure
a
rich
satisfying
brew
good
strong
bitter
o
a
true
hoppy
barleywine
vermonster
100
ibus
in
a
good
dark
fruity
base
o
nice
take
on
this
style
good
complexity
this
is
one
of
those
beers
where
it
gets
a
high
score
but
to
the
everyday
beer
drinker
in
america
it
tastes
like
the
inside
of
a
perfume
bottle
its
pretty
rough
on
the
taste
buds
i
also
got
a
migraine
headache
after
drinking
this
one
maybe
the
hops
in
it
were
a
bit
much
for
me
to
handle
seemingly
so
but
there
obviously
are
people
that
enjoy
this
beer
enjoy
but
i
think
ill
move
on
and
drink
the
grado
plato
chocarrubica
instead
i
really
liked
it
layers
of
malt
flavors
accented
by
some
dynamic
hops
this
one
is
dramatic
but
in
way
thats
a
bit
slow
it
unfolds
and
you
realize
it
as
it
does
then
you
think
on
it
a
bit
and
it
makes
you
smile
because
its
forceful
and
it
doesnt
seem
so
overall
a
good
barleywine
you
can
definitely
notice
the
100
ibus
thats
the
key
to
this
beer
i
know
barleywines
typically
age
well
and
that
holds
true
with
this
beer
but
the
awesome
dryhop
this
beer
gets
is
too
awesome
to
let
go
to
waste
i
love
this
beer
no
matter
what
age
but
if
its
super
fresh
3
months
or
less
it
rivals
among
my
favorites
my
review
lies
with
these
conditions
in
mind
finishes
clean
medium
to
heavy
body
carries
the
stiff
biterness
but
doesnt
linger
too
long
in
the
aftertaste
hop
bitterness
sticks
with
each
sip
and
hangs
around
briefly
at
the
end
keeping
the
drinkability
up
a
bit
aggressive
bitterness
doesnt
make
this
a
slow
sipper
as
much
as
it
braces
your
taste
buds
to
handle
the
heavy
malt
punch
without
flinching
this
truly
is
a
monster
of
a
beer
the
cloudy
brown
look
is
a
bit
intimidating
and
the
aroma
of
hops
and
darker
malts
almost
makes
me
almost
afraid
to
drink
it
as
if
champ
would
likely
jump
out
of
the
glass
and
chase
me
the
taste
was
just
mindblowingly
potent
full
of
hops
with
their
acidity
balancing
the
malts
taming
the
beast
try
tackling
this
monster
if
you
dare
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
caramelamber
coloring
with
a
frothy
foamy
cream
colored
head
that
settles
into
a
retaining
surface
coat
nose
of
cedar
and
pine
tassels
rich
and
resiny
hops
and
toffee
sweetness
flavors
are
rich
and
robust
with
a
decent
balance
throughout
hoppy
forward
with
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
notes
on
a
toffee
rich
backbone
notes
of
booze
highlight
as
well
as
some
earthy
tones
the
aftertaste
is
peppery
bitter
and
toffee
sweet
well
balanced
bittersweet
slightly
drying
finish
heavy
brew
o
this
beer
masks
its
alcohol
very
well
from
the
taste
and
is
also
rather
drinkable
for
the
style
because
its
packed
with
lots
of
hop
bitterness
that
prevent
this
from
being
too
malty
or
sweet
o
not
my
favorite
barleywine
but
this
is
pretty
tasty
its
not
overly
complex
but
i
think
what
it
does
it
does
well
i
have
a
feeling
that
in
a
flight
with
other
barleywines
this
would
come
up
a
little
short
on
complexity
but
would
score
high
on
drinkability
its
worth
a
taste
most
everything
going
on
is
something
i
like
in
beer
but
they
are
not
exactly
befitting
the
style
id
like
to
try
this
fresh
or
aged
o
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
truthfully
i
think
its
the
only
rock
art
beer
aside
from
black
moon
ipa
that
i
actually
like
and
would
drink
again
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
fits
more
on
the
british
side
of
barleywines
to
me
m
medium
body
light
carbonation
a
lot
of
stickiness
from
the
hop
oils
which
is
somewhat
surprising
given
the
lack
of
freshness
overall
its
a
decent
beer
however
its
not
top
tier
stuff
this
is
a
bit
amateurish
o
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easy
not
too
filling
strong
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
barleywine
to
drink
for
as
long
as
you
can
handle
it
o
not
a
bad
exhibition
of
a
beastly
brew
but
i
really
wanted
some
more
character
overall
its
an
interesting
take
on
a
barleywine
and
extremely
hop
forward
so
if
thats
your
thing
youll
probably
like
it
but
where
is
the
malt
presence
and
depth
on
this
i
am
not
into
sugar
rushes
but
even
i
would
want
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
and
caramel
on
this
compared
to
most
barleywines
overall
not
a
bad
brew
im
glad
i
bought
this
one
to
try
once
it
was
enjoyable
probably
wont
buy
it
again
though
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
and
some
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
sweet
flavor
and
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
i
think
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
o
overall
a
great
beer
that
is
very
easy
drinking
considering
its
100
ibus
and
10
abv
worth
seeking
out
i
really
like
the
veromonster
not
sure
why
the
aroma
was
such
a
let
down
otherwise
a
great
barleywine
i
wish
i
had
another
i
could
cellar
for
a
while
o
i
thought
this
was
a
very
solid
barleywine
and
one
that
i
would
come
back
to
frequently
if
it
was
more
easily
available
my
biggest
complaint
is
that
i
cant
find
a
bottling
date
or
a
drink
by
on
the
bottle
anywhere
i
didnt
perceive
this
one
to
be
anywhere
close
to
the
100
ibu
claimed
on
the
label
so
im
suspicious
that
the
bottle
may
have
some
age
on
it
and
the
hops
have
faded
whatever
the
situation
it
was
very
good
but
i
would
be
interested
to
compare
to
a
bottle
that
i
knew
to
be
fresh
poured
into
a
16
oz
snifter
bottle
date
looks
like
the
273
day
of
2011
pours
a
orange
red
with
a
huge
3
inch
head
off
white
with
loads
sticky
lace
smell
is
big
carmel
fruity
esters
pine
grapefruit
and
biscuit
taste
is
larger
but
amazingly
balanced
body
is
medium
large
plenty
of
carbonation
less
dry
than
you
expect
from
this
style
and
excellent
drinkability
for
its
size
this
is
very
impressive
a
fan
for
sure
from
the
22
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
on
june
11
2012
it
pours
an
amber
copper
tone
with
a
tremendous
beige
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
the
colors
are
seen
through
a
bit
of
a
haze
aromatic
for
sure
with
a
fabulous
collection
of
sweet
caramel
malts
wild
berries
earthypiney
hops
and
just
a
touch
of
yeast
to
meld
everything
together
topnotch
on
the
nose
the
body
is
medium
to
bold
but
overall
smooth
the
hops
are
upfront
on
the
taste
with
a
sweetness
taking
a
slight
back
seat
but
never
disappearing
i
had
this
one
fairly
fresh
and
i
like
to
let
barleywines
sit
for
a
bit
before
consuming
this
was
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
totally
enjoyable
not
bad
but
not
great
either
the
body
is
medium
with
sharp
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
solid
the
aroma
puts
me
off
a
little
bit
but
ill
enjoy
it
enough
this
time
o
i
really
cant
say
too
much
because
this
is
my
first
barleywine
its
got
the
hops
characteristics
of
an
ipa
yet
some
of
the
malts
of
a
strong
ale
i
would
have
this
again
and
would
like
to
explore
the
barleywine
style
a
bit
more
to
see
how
others
compare
to
rock
arts
o
i
thought
this
was
an
ipa
but
turns
out
its
a
barleywine
probably
my
least
favorite
ive
ever
tried
its
just
very
strange
and
not
well
put
together
overall
this
is
indeed
a
monster
it
is
a
bit
drier
of
a
beer
and
the
hop
profile
has
added
a
unique
bitterness
to
the
beer
set
up
against
a
roasty
and
sweet
malt
bill
im
not
sure
of
the
water
that
is
used
in
this
beer
but
there
is
certainly
something
unique
added
by
itsomething
that
gives
this
hefty
ale
a
neat
interesting
character
i
like
this
enough
that
i
would
drink
it
again
falls
a
bit
below
average
but
is
worth
drinking
when
you
just
want
to
open
something
on
any
occasion
overall
a
good
barley
wine
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
might
be
nice
to
age
one
and
see
what
happens
to
the
spice
if
you
havent
had
the
vermonster
yet
and
you
are
happy
it
is
because
you
have
never
truly
lived
o
a
very
solid
american
barleywine
that
pushes
the
limits
and
enjoys
being
extreme
if
you
enjoy
hoppy
barleywines
look
no
further
very
nice
price
point
too
and
always
available
at
least
in
this
area
big
bodied
smooth
with
a
nice
bubbly
tingle
in
the
finish
just
an
allaround
great
beer
overall
a
solid
barleywine
and
reasonably
priced
overall
this
was
a
huge
miss
for
me
the
drinkability
is
low
because
of
the
alcohol
and
brash
overdone
bitterness
leaving
this
one
a
slow
grumpy
sipper
little
malt
depth
hop
character
and
just
tons
of
coarse
bitterness
and
booze
not
my
cup
of
tea
o
one
of
the
more
drinkable
barleywines
straight
off
the
shelf
especially
at
10
had
this
beer
after
a
long
day
at
work
and
it
hit
the
spot
perfectly
for
10
an
absolutely
tasty
brew
no
taste
or
hint
of
high
abv
at
all
leaves
a
beautiful
film
on
the
glass
a
great
winter
brew
will
enjoy
more
once
we
get
some
more
snow
shout
out
to
franklloydmike
for
buying
as
a
house
er
apartment
warming
gift
perhaps
i
will
more
intently
review
this
beer
sometime
when
i
havent
already
had
a
glass
of
it
o
at
10abv
the
alcohol
balanced
well
with
the
malt
nothing
exciting
about
this
beer
this
is
my
first
barleywine
so
im
not
very
accustomed
to
the
style
its
not
bad
i
really
like
the
100ibu
bitterness
but
it
lacks
depth
and
character
to
me
im
kind
of
disappointed
the
guy
at
the
brew
shop
talked
this
one
up
maybe
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
im
not
sure
i
will
definitely
try
more
barleywines
in
the
futures
to
compare
im
glad
i
got
past
the
terrible
bottle
art
and
gave
this
try
also
5
99
for
a
10
abv
bomber
amazing
it
is
interesting
to
me
that
a
100
ibu
ale
can
be
slightly
malt
centric
full
disclosure
i
am
a
west
coast
dipa
fan
stone
ruination
sets
the
standard
for
me
so
i
am
a
hophead
for
sure
nonetheless
this
is
a
solid
respectful
ale
from
a
stellar
east
coast
brewer
rock
on
rock
art
overall
another
solid
part
of
the
rock
art
lineup
that
can
stand
up
to
most
barleywines
very
nice
skews
malty
but
in
my
wheel
house
yum
d
thank
you
vermonster
may
i
have
another
actually
another
would
put
me
under
the
table
with
this
bews
amazingly
camouflaged
10
abv
very
robust
and
flavorful
nice
toasty
and
very
rich
malts
with
incredibly
resinous
and
complex
hops
the
heft
does
slow
you
down
with
works
well
for
all
the
character
this
one
has
for
the
price
in
vt
this
is
superb
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
more
but
its
way
too
dry
for
my
taste
too
harshly
bitter
and
unbalanced
the
surely
prodigious
malty
body
just
isnt
sturdy
enough
to
compete
overall
not
my
favorite
barleywine
by
a
long
shot
but
again
am
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
somewhat
one
dimensional
to
me
way
too
sweet
loved
it
go
lers
a
decent
barleywine
but
ultimately
fairly
typical
i
can
tell
this
has
a
little
age
on
it
but
perhaps
not
enough
age
it
could
have
been
in
that
awkward
phase
barlewine
geeks
so
often
talk
about
enjoyable
nonetheless
even
though
i
prefer
less
bitterness
in
my
barleywines
delicious
pick
this
one
up
o
not
really
a
fan
of
this
one
big
on
booze
sweetness
and
hops
with
no
real
balance
just
a
monster
of
a
beer
that
i
cant
get
through
average
at
best
pass
a
little
sweet
but
overall
not
bad
especially
for
the
price
should
i
see
this
again
yes
probably
yes
o
good
barleywine
that
i
will
be
picking
up
again
when
in
vt
especially
when
offered
at
such
a
fair
price
5
quite
an
easydrinking
barleywine
for
a
style
which
i
usually
find
myself
struggling
to
finish
m
surprisingly
smooth
for
how
big
this
beer
is
obviously
theres
an
imbalance
in
hops
and
malt
but
for
how
bitter
this
beer
is
the
malts
still
manage
to
show
themselves
pretty
damn
well
id
love
to
try
aging
this
behemoth
too
bad
it
would
never
last
long
enough
in
my
house
o
a
good
standard
barleywine
slightly
hot
but
some
age
should
mellow
that
out
i
liked
it
above
average
brown
though
you
can
see
some
light
through
it
no
head
and
a
nice
lace
top
it
off
smell
is
hopped
for
sure
but
with
a
subtle
sugary
undertone
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
too
taste
is
not
very
strong
at
all
there
is
the
natural
piney
hoppness
you
would
expect
from
a
barley
wine
but
not
too
strong
there
is
also
a
sugary
nuttiness
about
it
as
well
the
alcohol
is
there
and
that
keeps
this
a
sipper
it
is
actually
nicely
carbonated
and
not
harsh
going
down
has
the
warm
feeling
on
the
way
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
mouth
is
good
for
a
bw
and
its
not
too
boozey
this
is
a
big
beer
sweet
and
then
bitter
at
the
end
very
tasty
if
youre
a
ipa
fan
youll
enjoy
this
even
though
its
a
barleywine
it
reminds
me
of
a
imperial
ipa
although
this
is
a
100
ibu
monster
a
lot
of
the
bitterness
is
subdued
by
the
sweetness
making
this
very
well
balanced
overall
the
smell
was
very
nice
but
the
malt
really
disappeared
behind
the
hops
tasted
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
barleywine
good
but
not
great
b
the
mouthfeel
is
about
average
for
the
style
and
carbonation
is
a
little
above
average
overall
it
was
a
very
nice
beer
it
was
definitely
a
very
hop
forward
version
of
the
style
but
it
worked
well
for
it
very
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
for
the
style
and
a
very
good
beer
overall
cola
brown
in
colour
auburn
highlights
dense
creamy
light
beige
head
sweet
floral
slightly
spicy
aroma
caramel
slightly
roasty
malts
are
big
up
front
yet
still
restrained
as
spicy
piney
hops
start
to
dominate
and
yield
a
pithy
bitter
finish
full
bodied
and
warming
on
the
way
down
surprisingly
balanced
considering
the
quoted
abv
the
hops
sometimes
come
off
as
slightly
overpowering
and
detracting
from
the
beers
overall
complexity
still
an
enjoyable
take
on
a
style
im
unfortunately
not
all
that
familiar
with
skål
reveal
the
vermonster
by
rock
art
brewery
no
wood
but
excellent
brew
d
i
really
dont
know
what
to
think
of
this
one
besides
that
it
needs
more
time
too
much
heat
really
detracts
from
some
other
good
flavors
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
what
cause
other
reviews
are
much
more
favorable
however
gotta
go
with
whats
in
my
glass
this
is
a
medium
bodies
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
bold
fusel
abv
and
modest
bitterness
compliment
one
another
for
a
barleywine
this
is
like
a
hybrid
of
the
styles
smells
sweet
and
englishlike
but
is
boldly
filled
with
alcohol
and
bitterness
like
the
american
counter
part
not
bad
its
worth
trying
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
more
that
i
did
it
looks
and
smells
great
there
are
a
lot
of
complex
flavors
going
on
but
they
just
dont
balance
each
other
maybe
this
would
benefit
from
some
age
but
i
just
feel
like
there
are
much
better
barleywines
out
there
right
now
thanks
to
ratman
for
bringing
this
one
over
last
saturday
night
i
had
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
some
time
now
not
sure
how
old
this
one
was
but
i
know
it
had
been
aged
for
awhile
poured
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
aromas
of
raisins
caramel
toffee
and
dark
fruits
medium
to
full
bodied
with
flavors
of
dark
fruit
caramel
and
toffee
decent
price
but
probably
wouldnt
purchase
again
without
some
knowledge
as
to
the
age
of
the
beer
overall
this
is
the
best
barleywine
i
have
had
it
showcases
both
dry
and
sweet
aspects
of
malts
i
t
also
showcases
pine
like
citrus
like
grassy
and
bitter
elements
of
hops
this
is
a
very
balanced
and
complex
beer
i
wish
i
could
find
this
beer
locally
o
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
barleywine
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
what
some
age
does
to
this
brew
o
i
reallyloved
the
taste
right
off
the
bat
however
once
it
warmed
this
became
a
bit
of
a
struggle
to
finish
as
others
have
said
it
took
me
well
over
an
hour
to
finish
by
myself
not
a
detracting
factor
per
se
but
i
will
be
sharing
this
with
several
others
in
the
future
overall
a
pretty
solid
bwine
this
is
a
very
nice
barleywine
overall
with
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malt
in
both
the
smell
and
the
taste
it
makes
me
want
to
check
out
the
rest
of
rock
arts
lineup
overall
not
bad
i
was
hoping
for
just
a
little
more
in
the
way
of
hops
i
liked
it
but
it
took
over
an
hour
to
get
through
the
bottle
will
need
to
be
shared
next
time
thick
body
lighter
carbonation
sticky
and
syrupy
on
the
palate
warm
heavy
drinking
but
still
pretty
tasty
from
top
to
bottom
although
this
is
definitely
a
bottle
best
split
with
a
friend
very
well
done
american
barleywine
medium
body
and
a
medium
carbonation
i
remember
reading
a
few
reviews
about
a
year
ago
on
this
one
and
it
beat
what
my
expectations
were
for
it
nicely
done
rock
art
drinkability
for
the
style
i
would
have
this
again
in
a
year
to
see
how
it
evolves
i
recommend
this
to
those
seeking
an
american
barleywine
that
features
the
malt
backbone
and
hop
bitterness
which
are
crucial
to
the
style
at
times
these
reminded
me
of
quality
dipas
or
aged
ones
like
burton
baton
but
it
is
not
as
hoppy
as
the
100
ibus
would
have
you
think
and
as
a
barleywine
it
is
good
but
nothing
earthshattering
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
round
and
juicy
at
first
tending
toward
astringent
toward
the
finish
a
bit
different
than
many
barleywines
at
times
it
seems
more
like
a
black
ipa
or
an
old
ale
an
intriquing
beer
worth
checking
out
all
in
all
a
solid
barleywine
i
think
that
as
far
as
my
tastes
go
in
barleywines
that
a
few
years
on
this
bottle
could
tone
down
that
hop
bitterness
quite
significantly
i
find
american
barleywines
lacking
in
the
tobaccoesque
light
smoke
flavors
that
i
pick
up
on
in
english
barleywines
and
enjoy
so
much
i
dont
know
that
id
drink
a
bomber
of
vermonster
by
myself
ever
and
at
10
its
not
exactly
sessionable
good
to
drink
with
a
buddy
and
definitely
worth
a
try
this
was
a
very
good
barleywine
lots
of
complex
flavor
surprisingly
very
easy
to
drink
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
large
tan
head
smells
of
hops
and
a
bit
of
ethel
alcohol
what
is
this
beer
again
i
rechecked
the
bottle
tastes
more
like
a
dipa
with
characteristics
of
a
barleywine
than
a
hopforward
american
barleywine
to
me
not
to
belabor
the
point
but
other
hop
forward
american
barleywines
have
often
been
clearly
barleywines
this
not
so
much
if
you
told
me
it
was
a
funky
dipa
i
would
be
in
stronger
than
expected
carbonation
as
a
barleywine
carries
all
the
way
through
as
a
dipa
this
is
expected
and
enjoyed
as
does
the
big
hop
and
malt
characteristics
either
way
the
taste
is
good
not
great
its
definitely
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
as
a
dipa
or
an
american
barleywine
its
a
bit
like
throwing
the
kitchen
sink
into
the
style
there
is
little
in
the
way
of
subtlety
or
balance
in
there
just
lots
anyone
looking
for
a
hopforward
astringent
barleywine
should
look
no
further
as
this
one
is
all
about
the
pine
and
grapefruit
with
the
malts
playing
a
supporting
role
at
most
d
ok
sort
of
strange
in
its
construction
d
a
pretty
nice
barleywine
would
like
to
try
again
sometime
flight
got
canceled
was
happy
to
find
this
at
the
gas
station
across
from
the
hotel
poured
into
hotel
water
glass
hazy
brown
liquid
with
reddish
brown
hues
tiny
off
white
head
fades
to
collar
with
minimal
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malts
and
some
sugar
caramel
and
toffee
some
spicy
hops
as
well
taste
is
a
balance
of
bitter
hops
and
caramal
malts
sweet
with
a
very
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
heavy
with
a
mediumlight
carbonation
good
but
not
great
this
is
a
fine
hoppy
barleywine
this
bottle
wasnt
as
hoppy
as
some
of
the
other
vermonsters
i
have
had
and
prefer
very
possible
it
had
been
sitting
outnot
well
stored
at
the
gas
station
for
a
while
but
good
regardless
d
definitely
would
have
this
guy
again
gotta
love
vermont
with
100
ibus
indicated
on
the
label
i
couldnt
resist
glad
i
purchased
three
bottles
of
this
one
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
bitter
barleys
overall
very
interesting
beer
i
would
love
to
have
this
aged
a
couple
years
a
reddishbrown
beer
with
a
decent
head
for
the
abv
and
minimal
lacing
the
nose
is
full
of
toffee
dark
fruits
and
bread
citrus
and
pine
notes
the
taste
has
toffee
caramelized
malts
dark
breads
that
barleywine
malt
bite
bitter
hops
a
slight
alcohol
burn
on
the
finish
that
doesnt
interfere
with
the
experience
a
nice
thick
mouthfeel
resinous
enjoyable
carbonation
a
solid
barelywine
that
i
will
revisit
again
drinkability
is
not
so
hot
in
my
opinion
i
dont
get
where
the
100
ibus
are
hiding
i
dont
think
this
is
old
i
just
bought
it
from
a
reputable
place
the
alcohol
is
always
noticeable
and
theres
not
too
much
happening
in
the
taste
drinkabilityi
like
this
one
and
i
think
they
are
on
the
right
track
i
need
to
try
and
get
a
really
fresh
bottle
to
try
d
the
hype
surrounding
this
offnamed
ale
a
litigious
situation
with
the
monster
energy
drink
folks
scuffled
late
last
year
made
it
worth
seeking
good
flavor
and
aroma
made
it
worth
enjoying
not
the
most
amazing
barleywine
ive
tried
but
not
a
disappointment
either
drinkability
big
abv
and
hefty
mouthfeel
without
too
much
flavor
complexity
mouthfeel
is
moderately
thick
and
typical
of
of
a
barleywine
overall
its
very
nice
id
like
to
see
how
it
would
do
with
another
year
or
two
to
tame
the
hops
down
pours
a
moderate
copper
with
an
off
white
head
smell
is
sweet
malt
red
fruits
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
caramel
taste
goes
quite
a
bit
downhill
with
some
astringencies
and
a
bit
of
a
metallic
flavor
the
sweetness
comes
through
but
thats
about
it
mouthfeel
is
slightly
boozy
and
offputtingly
dry
poor
drinkability
which
is
disappointing
as
i
was
quite
looking
forward
to
breaking
this
out
with
the
cool
weather
wow
is
this
bigfoots
uncle
not
for
the
faint
of
palate
as
this
beer
rips
across
the
taste
buds
however
a
must
for
the
hophead
and
a
great
find
for
the
typical
beer
geek
as
for
cellaring
dont
drink
it
fresh
and
let
the
hops
take
you
for
a
ride
alcohol
taste
has
some
effect
on
both
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
but
this
is
still
a
drinkable
barleywine
i
am
drinking
the
whole
bottle
and
enjoying
all
22
oz
12713just
had
this
again
as
my
buddy
sean
brought
down
a
fresh
bottle
from
vt
and
man
was
this
hoppy
and
full
of
life
everything
about
it
was
hoppier
with
the
hops
much
more
present
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
rich
smoky
malts
and
caramel
still
dominate
but
the
hops
in
thi
sbottle
make
this
seem
like
it
was
oak
aged
super
slick
this
went
down
with
extreme
ease
and
was
so
flavorful
that
the
abv
was
only
a
minor
accent
a
great
beer
this
bottle
is
from
109
so
at
almost
a
year
in
the
cellar
its
way
way
too
hot
comes
across
as
raw
in
general
though
and
i
like
that
in
a
beer
so
aptly
named
as
the
vermonster
impression
another
fine
beer
from
rock
art
if
you
like
a
hoppy
barleywine
youll
love
this
glad
to
hear
that
rock
art
came
out
on
top
with
their
legal
battles
surrounding
this
brew
anyway
vermonster
comes
out
a
dark
rubybrown
color
with
a
healthy
inch
of
tan
heading
that
lasts
the
nose
is
of
caramel
honey
dark
fruit
strawberries
come
to
mind
and
an
herbal
spicy
smell
as
well
the
taste
starts
off
on
the
sweet
side
for
a
split
second
and
then
the
100
ibus
worth
of
hops
make
their
appearance
bathing
the
palate
with
juicy
yet
bitter
hop
notes
i
also
get
some
grapefruit
tobacco
and
bubblegum
the
bitterness
cannot
be
overstated
with
this
beer
while
the
body
is
very
big
the
alcohol
is
not
readily
noticeable
the
drinkability
is
hindered
somewhat
by
the
astringent
amount
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
though
i
suspect
that
is
precisely
what
they
were
going
for
this
time
final
thoughts
are
that
it
is
nice
to
see
a
barleywine
with
such
a
heavy
hop
presence
comparing
a
fresh
bottle
with
an
aged
one
would
be
very
interesting
i
suspect
d
this
one
is
something
to
take
slow
it
sure
is
a
monster
and
it
deserves
its
respect
nice
take
at
an
american
barleywine
overall
a
very
nice
offering
from
a
small
brewery
vermont
continues
to
churn
out
nice
little
beers
at
a
decent
price
the
mouthfeel
is
cloying
and
slightly
thick
but
carbonation
helps
lift
the
flavors
through
your
palate
easily
and
by
easily
i
mean
powerfully
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
big
barleywine
very
fitting
of
rock
arts
10th
anniversary
the
finish
is
dry
and
very
delicious
with
a
hint
of
black
cherries
or
raspberry
enjoy
this
on
its
own
after
dinner
or
as
a
night
cap
with
friends
and
please
pour
into
a
snifter
tulip
or
red
wine
glass
not
a
pint
glass
thank
you
your
efforts
will
reward
you
unexpectedly
delicious
this
has
a
big
caramel
malt
flavor
to
it
with
undertones
of
dark
fruit
and
sherry
reminding
me
of
traditional
english
barleywines
only
with
significantly
more
hops
the
malt
character
is
rich
without
lending
excessive
sweetness
almost
nutty
in
character
fullbodied
with
a
long
resiny
finish
plenty
complex
but
easy
to
sip
on
this
is
one
of
the
finer
american
barleywines
ive
had
this
year
d
very
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
id
like
to
see
how
this
one
ages
highly
recommended
very
nice
to
drink
poured
a
dark
ruby
into
a
tulip
style
glass
solid
finger
and
a
half
of
head
with
decent
lacing
smell
is
quite
hoppy
w
strong
notes
of
pine
slight
hint
of
malt
comes
though
if
u
look
for
it
taste
was
hoppy
w
a
definite
pine
oil
citrus
taste
up
front
as
the
beer
warms
it
begins
to
show
its
malt
caramel
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
slightly
lacking
in
my
personal
opinion
i
like
barelywines
w
a
full
mouthfeel
this
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
at
best
the
drinkability
was
good
every
sip
went
down
smoothly
it
hides
the
alcohol
content
rather
well
all
together
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
by
anymeans
it
just
doesnt
stand
up
to
some
of
the
other
american
barelywines
out
there
d
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
one
but
in
the
end
id
say
its
a
fairly
average
barleywine
on
the
plus
side
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
would
like
to
see
how
it
ages
overall
really
nice
but
now
i
wish
i
could
try
it
fresh
overall
a
decent
beer
that
i
wouldnt
shy
away
from
overall
nice
big
beer
with
a
lot
of
alcohol
that
is
not
overbearing
like
the
label
says
allow
yourself
to
retreat
into
your
happy
spot
and
enjoy
one
of
the
better
american
barleywines
ive
had
this
year
the
bottle
advertises
it
as
the
big
brother
of
rock
arts
other
barleywine
which
i
havent
had
and
it
delivers
big
delicious
flavor
and
aroma
as
promised
as
for
the
bizarre
you
are
feeling
quite
peaceful
you
are
ascending
into
a
land
of
calmness
hypnotist
mantra
type
things
on
the
label
i
dont
know
overall
a
good
hoppy
barleywine
that
i
recommend
the
bitter
does
start
to
pile
up
and
you
can
feel
the
10
as
you
go
along
so
its
a
good
sharing
beer
or
end
of
night
beer
rotation
not
available
here
in
tx
so
was
fortunate
to
get
as
an
extra
for
now
one
is
probably
enough
as
there
are
others
that
i
like
better
but
id
like
to
try
one
again
in
a
few
years
as
my
bitter
palate
develops
ooml
nice
but
a
little
diacetyl
is
detected
buttery
with
caramel
toffee
fig
and
date
again
the
malt
is
toasty
and
nutty
mouth
is
slightly
thin
and
light
got
this
as
an
extra
for
my
first
trade
nice
surprise
since
rock
art
is
not
distributed
in
my
area
that
i
know
of
sweet
malty
smell
with
a
little
hops
tasted
like
a
malty
barlywine
mixed
with
an
ipa
probably
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
so
far
im
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
that
style
but
i
try
them
occasionally
d
i
think
1
bomber
is
enough
but
for
the
style
i
think
that
its
expected
i
think
after
this
my
tastebuds
will
not
be
too
happy
for
a
different
beer
10
is
not
noticed
so
its
not
hard
to
drink
the
bomber
a
good
american
barleywine
d
this
is
an
awesome
american
barleywine
so
full
of
flavor
and
hearty
mouthfeel
it
could
be
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
purchesed
for
5
this
22oz
at
10
alcohol
was
a
great
deal
so
the
hops
overpower
the
malts
interesting
that
the
advertising
of
the
beer
talks
more
about
malts
than
hops
this
is
a
problem
you
know
i
keep
talking
about
the
balance
of
beers
this
beer
is
not
balanced
it
is
a
barleywine
it
is
supposed
to
be
strong
and
it
is
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
i
wouldnt
be
ashamed
to
bring
it
to
a
party
but
it
doesnt
distinguish
itself
enough
to
be
a
best
in
class
i
had
this
beer
from
a
22oz
bottle
it
poured
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
slight
haziness
the
head
was
an
off
white
color
about
an
inch
thick
it
dissipated
fairly
quickly
and
left
a
medium
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
and
taste
combine
caramel
malts
a
pine
hop
flavor
and
a
noticeable
amount
of
alcohol
i
think
the
alcohol
should
be
a
bit
more
balanced
with
the
other
flavors
to
improve
the
drinkability
overall
poured
into
a
new
belgium
glass
dark
mahagony
brown
the
scent
is
of
strong
malted
sweetness
with
chocolate
notes
the
taste
is
rather
smooth
for
a
barleywine
very
well
balanced
of
hops
and
malts
no
over
use
that
shocks
the
toungue
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
have
any
noticable
alcohol
burn
for
this
amount
of
abv
this
is
overall
a
very
nice
barleywine
and
very
drinkable
pours
a
deep
burnished
copper
color
with
a
sticky
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
fair
bit
of
lace
on
the
way
down
smells
of
brown
sugar
caramel
toffee
vanilla
pine
slight
touch
of
alcohol
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malt
cut
in
half
with
bitter
pine
resin
malty
sweet
with
enough
hop
bitterness
to
keep
everything
in
check
surprisingly
balanced
taste
for
a
beer
that
brags
about
100
ibus
alcohol
is
well
hidden
on
this
one
long
lingering
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
resinous
and
sticky
mouthfeel
full
body
light
to
medium
level
of
carbonation
i
like
this
one
a
lot
reminds
me
of
bigfoot
with
a
year
or
two
on
it
when
the
malt
starts
to
show
up
why
did
i
wait
so
long
to
try
this
one
d
had
this
once
before
and
dont
recall
there
being
any
citrus
notes
and
wasnt
all
that
impressed
with
the
overall
product
glad
i
revisited
because
im
enjoying
it
quite
a
bit
this
time
around
ill
have
to
give
this
a
third
go
at
some
point
and
see
if
the
positive
impression
continues
very
easy
to
drink
tasty
and
not
too
sweet
thats
about
it
this
is
a
fine
ale
and
is
better
than
i
expected
drinkability
im
still
not
too
big
on
barleywines
but
i
decided
to
give
this
beer
a
try
after
its
legal
problems
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
can
see
myself
drinking
again
thanks
indiapaleale
thanks
again
mark
cheers
the
drinkability
should
be
higher
but
i
cannot
justify
it
i
will
say
that
the
2nd
half
of
the
bottle
was
better
and
a
bit
fuller
when
some
of
the
dregs
made
its
way
into
the
glass
the
yeast
helped
to
liven
things
up
a
bit
i
should
of
just
dumped
the
1st
half
and
worked
with
the
2nd
half
ill
try
it
again
down
the
road
and
revise
if
i
see
fit
as
i
see
that
another
reviewer
from
pa
had
the
same
problem
in
feel
this
monster
was
not
scary
at
all
it
did
not
even
startle
me
d
decent
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
little
more
of
but
the
bomber
does
the
job
nicely
impressive
beer
with
lots
of
big
flavors
not
exactly
sure
how
fresh
this
one
is
but
i
bet
when
its
really
fresh
its
even
more
of
a
monster
great
beer
glad
i
got
to
try
it
the
nose
is
of
lightly
roasted
malt
caramel
and
earthy
hops
the
10
is
deftly
hidden
the
flavor
is
caramel
with
a
light
sweetness
pine
character
and
earthy
hops
are
evident
as
is
a
little
chocolate
and
a
dash
of
brown
sugar
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
full
this
drank
easy
for
the
high
abv
a
solid
beer
reminds
me
of
arrogant
bastard
i
wish
the
bottle
i
had
was
fresher
this
beer
was
definitely
malt
forward
for
a
supposedly
100
ibu
beer
i
guess
ill
have
to
try
it
again
extremely
drinkable
this
stuff
goes
down
way
too
easily
ive
been
wanting
to
try
some
vermonster
for
awhile
now
glad
i
finally
got
the
chance
very
very
bitter
with
an
overwhelming
hop
taste
that
couples
with
pine
resin
flavor
to
drown
out
any
hints
of
the
carmel
that
appears
in
the
aroma
the
texture
was
horrible
i
have
never
had
such
a
chewy
beer
before
and
the
thin
carbonation
only
exacerbated
the
problem
the
body
was
jsut
too
big
to
deliver
any
semblance
of
drinkability
and
for
the
first
time
in
25
years
i
had
to
cut
it
31
with
water
4
544
544
pale
mahogany
in
color
small
tight
tan
head
moderate
aromahas
a
mellow
oakeyvanilla
thing
to
it
very
floral
and
somewhat
caramel
like
big
malty
flavor
good
level
of
hops
going
on
again
a
faint
oakvanilla
flavor
long
lingering
bitterness
gets
a
tad
boozy
as
it
warms
and
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
very
nice
mouthfeelat
times
an
almost
creamy
smoothness
the
boozyalcohol
tinge
gives
it
a
faint
acrid
bite
very
enjoyable
and
satisfying
i
nursed
this
over
a
solid
hour
and
it
just
got
better
well
balanced
and
the
best
rock
art
beer
i
have
had
buy
again
yes
overall
a
fascinating
beer
id
definitely
have
it
again
if
i
could
find
it
but
i
sort
of
doubt
i
will
since
other
than
that
one
time
ive
never
seen
it
in
local
stores
ill
be
visiting
western
ma
in
a
month
or
so
ill
look
for
it
there
medium
carbonation
mid
bodied
drinkable
enough
for
a
barleywine
overall
an
interesting
entry
in
the
category
actually
stood
up
fairly
decently
in
a
side
by
side
with
mirror
mirror
but
fell
just
a
hair
short
of
that
beer
not
perfect
but
well
executed
and
tasty
enough
that
ill
definitely
be
seeking
out
more
rock
art
beers
in
the
near
future
overall
a
pretty
okay
barleywine
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
but
i
cant
say
it
was
my
particular
cup
o
tea
d
this
is
an
aggressive
beer
a
slow
sipper
for
me
i
will
have
another
but
at
a
later
date
would
i
buy
more
of
it
yes
and
i
can
honestly
say
that
rock
art
makes
some
of
the
most
affordable
craft
beers
on
the
market
this
bottle
was
less
than
7
id
like
to
have
a
bottle
to
keep
around
for
a
year
or
so
and
then
compare
it
with
a
fresh
one
md
silky
sticky
sweet
body
is
appropriate
for
style
and
matches
the
rest
of
the
brew
well
easy
to
drink
considering
the
abv
but
still
obviously
a
potent
concoction
overall
a
beer
i
very
much
enjoyed
on
my
100th
ba
review
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
first
whiff
is
strong
on
the
hops
specifically
a
strong
piney
aroma
you
also
get
a
little
caramel
malt
and
alcohol
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
a
lot
of
pine
and
grapefruit
hops
up
front
with
a
strong
caramel
backbone
later
in
the
taste
when
the
beer
is
cold
it
is
very
unbalanced
and
hoppy
the
beer
gets
much
more
balanced
as
it
warms
up
although
the
alcohol
stays
present
throughout
not
really
sure
how
close
this
fits
the
american
barleywine
style
since
it
is
so
hoppy
but
it
is
very
good
regardless
recommended
much
thanks
go
to
sparklepants
who
shared
this
beer
with
me
tonight
dasrk
amber
in
the
tulip
not
much
in
the
way
of
foam
and
no
lacing
not
really
expecting
much
in
the
appearance
departement
from
such
a
high
abv
beer
so
this
gets
my
default
4
aroma
is
all
hops
up
front
nice
and
piney
with
some
sweet
malts
in
the
background
booze
bring
up
the
rear
end
of
the
nose
and
im
detecting
just
a
hint
of
raostiness
on
the
back
end
flavor
is
nice
and
hoppy
bitter
for
sure
resiny
pine
and
a
solid
well
structured
malt
profile
caramel
is
in
the
forefront
of
the
malt
side
followed
by
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
the
lightest
bit
of
roastiness
buried
deep
within
bitter
piney
hops
were
at
the
front
when
it
was
cold
but
as
it
warmed
the
malts
really
started
to
shine
and
became
extremely
wellbalanced
mouthfeel
was
a
tad
a
thin
for
me
and
the
booze
was
just
a
touch
too
strong
but
it
was
damn
tasty
all
aroundand
thats
whats
important
great
beer
and
would
like
to
thank
whichever
trader
hooked
up
sparklepants
with
this
one
and
she
herself
for
sharing
the
love
d
fairly
easy
to
forget
this
on
is
so
big
despite
the
booze
great
to
share
but
could
easily
have
this
bomber
on
my
own
pours
a
dark
brown
color
which
is
garnet
when
held
to
the
light
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
of
large
bubbles
with
good
retention
leaving
streaky
lacing
that
sticks
to
the
glass
the
alcohol
is
apparant
in
the
smell
with
grapefruit
raisin
fig
and
sweet
grapes
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
flavors
mix
with
sweet
concord
grapes
and
grapefruit
with
a
vanilla
finish
full
body
medium
carbonation
clean
drinking
beer
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
not
a
creeper
definitely
a
sipper
on
a
cold
vermont
winter
night
avg
b
though
it
has
aged
about
a
year
since
imagineiii
sent
it
to
me
this
beer
still
has
a
lot
of
hoppy
bitterness
going
for
it
thanks
for
the
opportunity
d
fairly
high
considering
the
abv
i
drank
this
one
quicker
than
i
thought
i
would
and
really
enjoyed
it
it
really
grew
on
me
and
by
the
end
of
the
bomber
i
want
to
climb
on
my
roof
and
shout
its
name
for
all
to
hear
i
will
buy
this
one
again
very
impressed
d
for
barelywine
dangerously
drinkable
on
the
palate
theres
a
big
influence
of
malt
and
not
just
hops
and
i
was
expecting
nothing
but
hops
given
the
boastful
100
ibu
label
so
theres
more
balance
than
expected
but
nothing
spectacular
one
way
or
another
on
the
palate
hops
dont
stand
out
malt
doesnt
stand
out
its
balanced
because
not
much
is
going
on
finish
is
somewhat
short
also
nothing
like
monster
energy
drink
incase
you
were
confused
notes
to
hansenmonster
beverages
this
is
in
no
way
confusable
with
your
yellowgreen
energy
drinks
please
drop
your
law
suit
against
rock
art
directly
blech
like
to
try
this
again
fresher
but
this
bottle
aint
that
old
d
drinkability
was
good
especially
for
its
10
0abv
which
is
masked
by
the
assertive
hoppiness
malty
hoppy
and
well
balanced
makes
for
a
easy
and
quite
enjoyable
hop
monster
indeed
definitly
one
of
rockarts
better
beers
22oz
bottled
served
in
my
gouden
carolus
chalice
poured
a
hazy
mahogany
with
a
quarter
inch
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
into
a
slick
with
a
thick
band
around
the
perimeter
embedded
with
tiny
bubbles
some
spots
of
lacing
but
weak
legs
nose
was
boozy
malty
molasses
taste
follows
nose
but
also
picked
up
some
bittering
hops
that
lingers
between
quaffs
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
and
lightly
effervescent
decent
consistency
with
a
slightly
oily
feel
this
is
a
big
beer
that
is
definitely
a
sipper
but
hops
bitterness
is
a
little
too
overpowering
for
my
likely
and
made
the
brew
seem
a
little
unbalanced
pours
cloudy
brown
with
minimal
tan
lacing
aroma
of
toffee
alcohol
caramel
coffee
taste
of
caramel
toffee
coffee
dark
fruits
with
a
strong
bitter
finish
of
cocoa
and
alcohol
medium
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
with
some
charecter
that
hides
its
alcohol
well
in
some
places
a
nice
beer
it
is
a
rare
occurrence
to
find
such
an
aggressively
hopped
barleywine
here
on
the
east
coast
coming
in
at
100
ibus
the
folks
at
rock
art
were
not
playing
around
with
this
offering
all
in
all
a
mighty
fine
brew
and
a
must
have
for
all
hop
heads
out
there
much
better
than
its
little
brother
this
is
a
barleywine
done
right
even
if
the
dial
is
turned
up
a
too
high
on
booze
courtesy
of
gillard
ive
been
pining
to
try
this
since
ryan
first
told
me
about
it
a
few
months
ago
oh
yeah
pour
slightly
hazy
amber
with
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
is
dark
fruity
esters
with
some
crystal
malty
sweetness
i
also
get
some
mild
hotness
too
it
tastes
nice
and
rich
with
a
lean
toward
sessionable
im
getting
some
malt
chewy
sweetness
leading
the
way
toward
dark
fruity
esters
like
plums
cherries
and
grapes
the
pine
hop
bitterness
mixes
nicely
with
the
other
notes
dbig
and
bold
with
tons
of
flavour
packs
a
fairly
serious
punch
that
seems
greater
than
its
10
abv
a
well
balanced
am
bwine
that
is
underappreciated
imho
overall
my
first
beer
from
rock
art
and
hopefully
not
my
last
those
treehuggin
maplesyrupmakin
hippies
might
not
allow
billboards
but
they
certainly
make
one
hell
of
barleywine
vermonster
is
a
pretty
cool
name
for
a
barleywine
brewed
in
the
green
mountain
state
trouble
is
the
beer
is
hot
rather
than
cool
even
at
almost
2
years
of
age
time
to
slow
down
so
that
my
brain
doesnt
become
as
numb
as
my
tongue
thanks
vermonthiker
d
i
remember
getting
a
bottle
of
this
years
ago
before
vt
changed
their
laws
and
it
was
listed
as
6
99
abv
and
calling
bullshit
on
that
this
is
a
good
beer
i
think
next
time
i
can
get
this
i
will
do
a
side
by
side
with
druid
fluid
i
would
probably
try
this
again
but
maybe
next
time
with
some
cheese
and
bread
d
one
glass
at
10
is
enough
for
one
night
if
i
had
a
bomber
id
need
to
barricade
myself
in
the
house
d
the
feel
and
taste
belie
the
10
abv
i
can
see
why
they
call
this
the
vermonster
unfortunately
as
the
beer
warms
the
main
component
that
comes
out
is
the
strength
of
the
alcohol
i
wouldnt
call
this
balanced
nor
particularly
drinkable
drinkability
interesting
and
very
fruity
alcohol
is
up
there
though
and
only
mildly
hidden
and
its
definitely
strange
not
sure
what
to
make
of
it
really
on
the
one
hand
all
the
right
notes
are
there
and
on
the
other
its
heavily
heavily
slanted
towards
yeasty
fruity
esters
i
was
slow
finishing
it
but
only
because
i
was
perplexed
worth
giving
it
a
shot
pours
a
deep
amber
red
with
a
large
off
color
head
theres
almost
no
smell
but
the
flavor
is
huge
malty
and
bitter
smokey
and
cherrylike
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
the
finish
leaves
a
lovely
bitterness
clinging
to
the
tongue
this
is
a
tasty
beer
though
the
malty
sweetness
tends
to
obscure
the
alcohol
pours
a
cloudy
orangeamber
with
a
fairly
minimal
head
this
is
another
american
barlywine
that
is
virtually
indistinguishable
from
a
double
ipa
a
bit
dry
for
a
barley
wine
but
there
is
a
big
hit
of
dry
malt
fairly
large
hop
hit
with
a
piney
earthy
taste
rather
than
in
the
citrusy
direction
the
taste
is
a
bit
stronger
here
than
in
the
aroma
and
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
lingering
bitterness
in
fact
most
of
the
sweetness
here
comes
out
in
the
aroma
rather
than
in
the
taste
very
firm
and
even
a
bit
spicy
in
the
mouth
and
just
a
tad
hot
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
but
quite
nice
d
pretty
solid
effort
and
one
id
like
to
revisit
drinkability
low
drinkability
brought
on
primarily
by
both
the
apparent
alcohol
and
brash
overdone
bitterness
leaving
this
one
a
slow
grumpy
sipper
exhibits
an
alarming
trend
in
american
barleywines
little
malt
depth
hop
character
and
just
tons
of
coarse
bitterness
and
booze
bartender
can
i
get
a
water
on
tap
poured
directly
into
a
snifter
this
barleywine
has
an
exceptional
balance
and
taste
a
bit
of
bitterness
and
a
little
smidgen
of
sweetness
added
to
the
depth
of
the
barley
and
high
abv
10
out
of
the
bottle
it
is
a
bit
ubercarbonated
but
this
my
first
ever
barleywine
on
tap
and
being
the
second
time
i
have
tried
this
beer
within
a
week
the
on
tap
version
blew
my
mind
the
color
was
a
deep
ruby
and
light
brown
with
a
great
creamy
head
that
overloaded
the
snifter
glass
rather
easily
having
received
a
recommendation
from
a
local
vermont
bartender
in
a
great
bar
in

this

the
local

ipa

whoa
drinkability
way
to
go
rock
art
for
making
a
great
hugely
hopped
barleywine
it
was
a
hugely
hopped
beer
without
being
too
aggressive
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
malt
in
here
but
that
might
have
lessened
the
hop
impact
on
my
taste
buds
it
would
be
a
joy
to
drink
again
d
over
the
top
decent
drinking
barleywine
you
know
its
strong
occasional
abv
notes
come
out
of
hiding
but
otherwise
has
a
good
balance
pours
clear
and
golden
with
massive
amounts
of
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
hop
heavy
even
more
so
than
the

lots
of
fresh
leafy
hop
goodness
pine
grass
and
spice
with
just
a
touch
of
orange
and
caramel
sweetness
alcohol
heat
stings
when
it
gets
warm
the
flavor
carries
the
same
punchy
hop
traits
and
is
impressively
very
dry
for
a
bw
though
not
quite
parching
fruity
caramel
shows
up
but
it
has
little
residual
sugar
to
muck
up
the
show
its
spicy
on
the
finish
which
turns
to
a
welcoming
heat
from
the
abv
medium

is
in
no

there
are

was

the
limit
has
to

given

a
bomber
of

takes
a

to

i
could

getting

this

its

better
than

although
not
something
id
save
for
a
quiet

by

i
would
certainly
find

a

good
to
sip
by

on

night
not
the

beer
in

style
but
a
good
bridge
beer
for
those
uninitiated
to
barleywines
worth
a
shot
seems
fuller
than
i
remember
the

runner
the
brewerys
other
barleywine
being
though
honestly
thats
not
saying
a
whole
lot
as
it
was
on
the
thinner
side
of
the
style
still
this
could
still
be
even
thickerricher
for
the
style
but
it
does
help
drinkability
which
is
easy
for
the
styleabv
drinks
well
for
a
10
brew
this
is
a
solid
choice
for
a
barleywine
that
lands
on
the
bitter
side
of
the
spectrum
and
for
only
four
bucks

recommend
letting

so
though
i
can
see
the

it
tastes
like

highly

yeasty
boozey

to

is
dominated
by

actually
had
to
make

it

i
had
picked
up

wrong

lots
of
earthy

a
tad
sour
all
in
all
its
a
very
nice
beer
but
considering
all
of
the
more
intenselyhopped
barleywines
ive
had
its
not
all
that
complex
but
very
drinkable
especially
for
the
high

clear

on

and
giving
it
a

of
an
acrid

were
present
in

were
overshadowed
by
the

this
is
a

brew
with
it
being
my
first
from
this
brewery
thanks
wayne
for
hooking
me
up
d
a
fine
barleywine
but
i
wished
for
more
bitterness
somewhat
bland
compared
to
some
barleywines
but
the
bold
qualities
are
certainly
there
distinct
hop
profile
and
cutting
alcohol
quality
d
i
am
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
one
of
the
few
big
vt
offerings
overall
not
something
i
would
actively
seek
out
in
the
future
just
a
bit
too
alcoholic
which
cancels
out
the
nuances
in
the
brew
still
enjoyable
but
only
if
shared
with
others
probably
not
able
to
finish
a
whole
bomber
myself
certainly
this
is
easy
to
drink
only
thing
missing
is
a
more
complex
flavor
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
pay
too
much
for
one
d
its
just
a
tad
over
the
top
to
drink
more
than
one
in
an
average
sitting
but
this
is
a
great
beer
cheers
pours
a
murky
brown
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
smell
is
very
inviting
sweet
malty
yeasty
plums
definite
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
sweet
maltiness
remains
with
a
definite
hop
presence
drinkability
suffers
a
tad
due
to
a
definite
astringent
quality
mouthfeel
is
affected
likewise
by
astringency
again
i
dont
agree
with
the
classification
as
a
barleywine
i
think
its
way
too
hoppy
so
if
youre
looking
for
that
be
aware
if
you
look
at
it
as
a
monster
hoppy
iipa
or
an
imperial
ipa
its
a
damned
nice
hop
fix
a
nice
barleywine
from
rock
art
overall
its
big
and
beefy
yet
subtle
at
the
same
time
well
worth
a
try
my
favorite
style
is
double
ipa
so
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
good
and
quite
drinkable
beer
however
i
think
it
is
miss
labled
as
a
barley
wine
pours
a
hazy
brown
in
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
small
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
juicy
berry
cotton
candy
and
citrusy
hoppiness
a
touch
of
the
alcohol
content
is
evident
as
it
warms
taste
follows
suit
with
a
good
dose
of
citrus
up
front
before
some
sweet
caramel
maltiness
blends
in
and
leads
into
a
bitter
and
slightly
peppery
finish
with
a
warming
alcohol
bite
mouthfeel
is
medium
soft
and
creamy
texture
in
the
background
is
overpowered
by
the
zing
and
bitterness
of
thw
hops
and
the
slight
warmth
from
the
alcohol
very
good
beer
def
in
the
dipa
camp
for
me
but
i
look
forward
to
ageing
one
and
seeing
what
develops
thanks
to
jim
and
adam
for
the
opportunity
mouthfeel
is
just
shy
of
a
nice
full
bodied
brew
the
after
taste
is
extremely
dry
with
a
hint
of
burning
to
it
i
feel
like
i
have
indulged
is
some
of
humulus
lupulus
dear
cousin
i
cant
remember
ever
having
a
beer
that
had
such
a
drying
affect
as
this
one
does
however
i
do
find
it
to
be
a
rather
enjoyable
beer
maybe
i
just
need
to
have
another
one
to
quench
my
thirst
overall
i
think
this
beer
would
benefit
greatly
with
some
time
in
the
cellar
as
it
is
right
now
the
flavors
are
all
over
the
place
and
somewhat
harsh
not
a
bad
brew
perhaps
too
young
100
ibus
either
im
completely
numb
to
hops
or
this
so
well
brewed
that
the
ibus
are
hidden
either
way
this
is
not
your
typical
100
ibu
hop
monster
its
almost
the
wasabi
for
hop
monsters
burns
for
a
second
then
its
over
interesting
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
enjoy
this
brew
on
two
seperate
occasions
and
i
cant
help
but
give
it
a
perfect
review
it
has
a
perfect
rusty
red
color
with
low
head
retention
the
aroma
is
out
if
this
world
with
intense
american
hops
dried
fruits
malt
sweetness
and
ethanol
spice
the
flavor
lives
up
to
the
promise
of
the
aroma
and
delivers
a
delightfully
complex
array
of
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
oily
as
is
expected
from
a
high
gravity
brew
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
barleywine
ales
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
to
sample
this
is
a
musttry
to
any
barleywine
fan
drinkability
an
enjoyable
old
aleenglish
barleywine
i
think
this
brew
has
tremendous
potential
for
ageing
a
lot
of
flavors
reminiscent
of
a
very
young
thomas
hardys
should
be
5s
across
the
board
in
a
year
or
two
ironically
the
first
true
extreme
beer
from
ra
does
not
carry
the
label
that
they
have
plastered
on
so
many
beers
one
possible
problem
there
are
already
some
oxidized
sherrylike
notes
so
this
might
not
be
as
longlived
as
id
hope
a
very
decent
crack
at
a
barleywine
i
look
forward
to
reviewing
this
again
in
a
year
or
two
wow
how
exciting
billed
as
the
big
brother
to
ridge
runner
and
can
only
be
found
at
state
liquor
stores
in
vermont
because
it
is
10
abv
looks
amazing
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
huge
flowing
tan
headskie
flavor
complex
with
a
fresh
hop
tang
out
front
and
some
chewy
malt
balance
backing
it
up
the
flavor
is
all
over
the
place
but
i
suspect
it
will
be
amazing
after
some
time
in
the
cellar
i
cant
wait
to
give
it
a
year
poured
into
a
heavy
glass
chalice
formed
a
scant
14
tan
head
over
the
clear
burgundy
brew
head
is
down
to
an
uneven
swirly
layer
of
bubbles
promptly
with
slowfalling
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
fruity
and
alcoholic
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
with
the
strong
alcohol
in
the
latter
half
dominating
and
being
of
the
sharp
rubbing
alcohol
type
mouthfeel
is
good
until
the
alcohol
overachieves
and
drinkability
is
limited
by
same
probably
not
one
id
search
out
again
pretty
rough
around
the
edges
at
this
point
but
could
be
a
good
candidate
for
aging
22oz
bottle
purchased
from
bauer
wines
in
boston
pours
a
rich
ruby
brown
with
ample
head
strong
boozy
malty
aroma
and
thats
exactly
how
the
taste
is
powerful
malty
and
hoppy
it
packs
quite
a
punch
all
around
the
alcohol
content
is
quite
evident
it
is
a
bit
sweet
but
not
overly
so
although
this
is
a
beer
that
will
certainly
make
you
take
notice
its
not
the
most
enjoyable
beer
in
the
world
im
finding
this
one
to
be
a
bit
of
a
chore
likely
due
to
its
very
high
malt
content
but
then
again
im
generally
not
a
big
barleywine
fan
so
feel
free
to
take
this
review
with
a
grain
of
malt
yet
as
the
beer
goes
on
that
noticeable
alcohol
does
its
trick
and
sucks
you
in
and
makes
you
fall
in
love
with
the
world
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
buy
it
the
next
time
i
see
it
on
tap
good
beer
not
quiet
my
style
a
solid
american
barleywine
definitely
a
duclaw
brew
i
can
get
excited
about
o
overall
tasty
i
could
see
how
some
fans
of
the
style
would
ding
this
for
not
being
a
little
more
bitter
but
i
am
digging
the
solid
hop
flavor
balancing
the
malt
this
barley
wine
certainly
leans
to
the
american
side
but
malt
heads
will
like
it
as
well
taste
is
big
oily
pine
light
caramel
and
earth
alcohol
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
an
above
average
american
barleywine
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
prefer
i
echo
dar482
sentiment
a
bit
its
a
tipa
oddly
balanced
not
too
malty
not
too
hoppy
i
was
initially
confused
and
then
i
remembered
its
duclaw
fun
beer
but
not
usually
great
beer
hwever
it
might
be
someones
gateway
into
barleywine
and
for
that
duclaw
i
thank
you
had
this
beer
in
chicago
3
years
ago
nj
couldnt
get
it
this
year
i
could
and
just
as
tasty
as
i
remember
in
general
i
would
categorize
this
as
a
really
well
made
triple
ipa
o
not
bad
but
i
think
this
one
changes
a
lot
over
the
course
of
a
year
and
is
probably
best
when
fresh
which
is
surprising
for
a
10
6
american
barleywine
o
average
if
i
tried
it
again
would
definitely
be
a
newer
bottle
or
would
go
for
the
barrel
aged
version
bad
one
to
try
pours
from
the
bottle
with
a
sparkling
clear
almost
pinkish
medium
brown
color
but
almost
no
head
the
aroma
is
disappointingly
muted
with
only
a
mild
grainy
sweetness
and
a
light
pine
character
being
discernable
the
flavor
is
more
forward
with
woody
hops
being
balanced
against
subtly
sweet
caramel
malts
its
not
too
boozy
or
sweet
as
many
barley
wines
can
get
and
rather
just
provides
a
full
balance
of
flavors
the
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
further
help
this
one
from
getting
too
syrupy
overall
despite
being
comparatively
mellow
for
a
10
barley
wine
the
rich
flavors
one
would
expect
still
come
through
taste
is
really
smooth
for
a
10
er
goes
down
really
easy
and
there
is
some
sort
of
sweet
lactosy
malt
that
makes
the
name
worthy
the
hops
have
faded
quite
a
bit
here
and
a
little
bit
of
oxidation
is
creeping
in
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
thin
but
that
sounds
worse
than
it
is
the
upside
is
that
is
really
easy
to
quaff
this
is
a
good
beer
id
like
to
try
a
fresh
one
to
see
what
kind
of
hop
load
it
has
o
brews
like
this
make
you
realize
how
well
crafted
something
like
sn
bigfoot
is
this
is
a
big
hot
boozy
mess
simple
direct
but
just
not
much
to
it
ive
enjoyed
many
of
duclaws
beers
much
more
than
this
one
decent
enough
but
this
needs
more
vavoom
now
if
only
duclaw
could
brew
x1
again
bottle
poured
a
murky
brown
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
minimal
retention
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
consists
of
deep
caramelized
malt
with
quite
a
bit
of
green
hoppy
notes
taste
is
also
a
mix
between
some
overly
sweet
caramelized
malt
with
some
stalled
green
hops
that
dont
really
mix
that
well
with
the
malt
backbone
body
is
about
average
with
mediumtolow
carbonation
and
light
apparent
alcohol
there
is
something
off
balanced
in
this
beer
that
i
didnt
particularly
enjoyed
o
for
being
a
barleywine
i
would
have
pegged
it
for
a
smooth
ipa
not
terrible
but
im
not
sure
he
palate
id
recommend
it
for
overall
im
really
enjoying
this
beer
its
a
bit
sweet
and
not
particularly
complex
but
it
is
satisfying
in
an
intangible
way
i
just
kind
of
hits
the
spot
this
beer
poured
phenomenal
and
smelled
great
but
once
it
hit
the
palate
it
was
a
bit
underwhelming
for
the
style
which
happens
to
be
one
of
my
personal
favorites
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
boozy
and
awkward
and
not
something
i
would
seek
out
if
looking
for
a
solid
barleywine
it
saddens
me
to
say
it
because
i
am
always
hoping
to
see
local
places
do
good
but
this
one
is
rough
i
appreciate
the
chance
to
try
this
but
would
probably
not
persue
again
o
overall
its
a
triple
ipa
thinly
disguised
as
an
barleywine
fairly
smooth
to
consume
even
at
10
6
had
a
few
of
thier
beers
previously
this
is
the
first
that
truely
impresses
me
o
a
tasty
beer
but
just
a
little
much
too
much
sweetness
too
thick
too
much
alcohol
if
they
had
toned
it
back
a
little
it
could
have
been
a
great
beer
but
i
can
barely
drink
a
12
oz
bottle
seems
more
like
an
english
barleywine
just
doesnt
hop
forward
enough
drank
fairly
easy
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
started
to
show
more
american
aspects
the
last
third
of
the
bottle
but
this
was
stored
served
at
56
degrees
so
it
had
to
warm
up
a
ton
to
really
show
what
it
was
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
i
want
more
o
really
good
barleywine
that
is
somewhat
local
taste
a
lot
like
bigfoot
might
be
the
hops
that
do
it
but
this
is
about
5
less
for
a
sixer
definitely
recommend
this
brew
good
offering
from
duclaw
o
awesome
barley
wine
i
grab
one
or
two
of
these
every
year
not
very
complex
however
it
is
well
balanced
the
10
6
abv
is
well
hidden
not
necessarily
something
i
would
purchase
again
though
a
solid
barleywine
nothing
about
it
really
wowed
me
but
it
was
solid
all
around
if
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
o
average
ale
the
taste
was
kind
of
flat
and
it
had
a
sort
of
watery
mouthfeel
smelled
good
though
fuller
medium
body
slightly
higher
carbonation
sticky
and
coating
on
the
tongue
extremely
hoppy
barleywine
that
could
probably
benefit
from
some
time
in
the
cellar
although
this
isnt
exactly
in
the
top
tier
of
the
style
o
overall
a
good
barleywine
this
is
nothing
unbelievable
and
the
barrel
aging
has
not
done
anything
great
to
the
complexity
it
is
a
little
deeper
but
nothing
transforming
overall
the
barrel
aging
has
added
some
oakiness
and
earthiness
but
maybe
the
barrel
they
chose
wasnt
as
fresh
as
it
could
have
been
pours
with
a
quickly
receeding
head
as
a
lovely
reddish
amber
served
fresh
the
piney
hops
are
muted
but
present
in
the
nose
the
body
is
surprisingly
soft
for
the
abv
it
starts
with
bready
malt
quickly
overcome
by
grapefruit
hops
the
alcohol
warms
the
finish
and
its
surprisingly
drinkable
for
the
abv
overall
i
would
welcome
seconds
this
is
so
far
the
best
beer
duclaw
has
made
in
a
shower
of
mediocre
beers
recommended
d
a
pretty
standard
barley
wine
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
sweet
malt
not
the
most
complex
but
reasonably
well
done
single
finger
head
with
excellent
lacing
on
a
clear
amber
with
straw
hues
body
aroma
is
malty
with
caramel
candied
fruit
and
light
toffee
very
smooth
caramel
malts
tanginess
candied
citrus
and
light
toffee
moderate
carbonation
and
smooth
oily
body
this
is
one
of
the
smoothest
and
more
drinkable
barleywines
i
have
had
very
good
and
highly
drinkable
for
the
style
pretty
mellow
and
smooth
for
the
high
abv
maybe
its
old
as
hell
dark
fruits
and
burnt
caramel
lightly
toasted
maltiness
all
blend
together
for
a
nice
concise
flavorful
sip
rather
subtle
though
a
bit
of
alcohol
heat
on
the
finish
for
a
barley
wine
its
pretty
drinkable
but
its
not
complex
or
presents
the
drinker
with
anything
unique
sweet
overall
with
a
big
chalky
mouthfeel
its
alright
id
take
it
over
a
lot
of
things
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
a
fairly
good
barleywine
but
nothing
close
to
the
top
ones
i
have
tried
all
that
said
this
isnt
my
favorite
barleywine
it
was
worth
trying
but
not
exactly
what
i
am
looking
for
so
i
most
likely
wont
buy
it
again
do
drinkability
is
moderate
i
keep
going
back
and
forth
on
this
beer
on
one
hand
i
love
the
assertiveness
of
this
beer
and
its
not
afraid
to
bring
the
flavor
however
i
feel
that
these
intense
flavors
are
not
congruent
with
each
other
a
strong
sweetness
is
immediately
replaced
with
bitterness
and
then
an
alcoholfilled
finish
its
not
smooth
in
its
transitions
and
by
the
time
you
reach
the
aftertaste
you
are
wishing
the
sweetness
would
return
o
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
had
very
unique
and
complex
but
also
drinkable
abv
is
hidden
well
drink
and
overall
well
this
beer
took
me
a
minute
to
warm
up
to
and
i
think
it
got
better
as
it
warmed
up
fairly
boozy
not
really
easy
to
drink
really
not
a
bad
beer
low
on
drinkability
as
it
is
on
the
sweeter
side
and
big
on
abv
but
for
a
onetimer
to
have
in
the
fridge
not
a
bad
choice
duclaw
seems
hit
or
miss
and
this
one
sits
closer
to
the
hit
side
of
things
medium
bodied
with
a
strong
hop
presence
up
front
that
lingers
over
the
sweeter
notes
into
a
sweet
slightly
dry
finish
some
dry
bitter
notes
with
hints
of
grassy
pine
followed
by
some
sweet
citrus
the
malts
are
pretty
tame
for
a
barleywine
without
being
overly
mustyleathery
hints
of
nut
caramel
and
toffee
as
well
as
a
sweeter
dark
fruit
character
subtle
sweetness
and
boozy
heat
in
the
finish
but
the
high
abv
is
well
masked
making
it
easy
to
drink
well
balanced
but
feels
more
like
a
strong
ale
than
a
barleywine
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
really
nice
amber
color
with
a
pretty
good
thin
yellowish
cream
colored
head
thin
not
much
lacing
but
stuck
around
for
a
while
on
top
the
smell
of
this
beer
has
a
really
nice
sweetness
grains
and
malts
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
also
sweet
its
got
a
citrus
kick
of
lemon
in
the
flavor
the
malts
and
grains
are
really
flavorful
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
smooth
nicely
balanced
overall
a
damn
good
barley
wine
rich
copper
color
fingers
worth
of
tan
head
smell
is
hop
and
sour
apple
figgy
dark
fruit
as
well
taste
is
strong
alcohol
incredibly
overpowering
in
fact
i
cant
get
past
a
few
sips
to
notice
anything
else
this
was
a
drain
pour
really
unworthy
of
this
lame
review
even
azy
dark
burnt
ruby
amber
very
intresting
hue
as
the
reddish
tint
was
very
noticeable
even
though
the
haze
made
it
almost
opaque
a
one
inch
head
formed
on
the
top
upon
pour
that
faded
almost
immediatly
what
was
left
was
a
thin
film
of
decent
quality
lace
that
circle
around
the
glass
smell
was
very
sweet
caramel
sugars
hitting
almost
immediatly
the
deeper
smell
after
some
warming
indicated
a
nice
bready
earthy
malt
back
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
which
at
9abv
and
being
a
barleywine
should
be
expected
the
taste
for
me
was
just
too
light
i
expect
barleywines
to
make
me
sit
down
and
to
be
a
definite
sipper
but
this
just
did
not
have
the
fullness
i
would
have
expected
the
finish
on
it
was
very
dry
and
did
last
a
good
bit
though
d
a
very
promising
american
barleywine
in
terms
of
appearance
and
aroma
but
quickly
becomes
average
at
best
when
taking
into
accounting
taste
mouthfeel
and
overall
drinkability
not
terrible
but
there
are
scads
and
scads
of
other
style
mates
that
i
would
opt
for
and
recommend
d
quite
good
but
the
strength
begs
it
to
be
sipped
poured
a
dark
copper
red
with
minimal
head
and
lace
a
large
malty
aroma
with
some
sticky
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
citric
fruity
hops
very
mediumclosetofuller
bodied
beer
with
some
sweet
caramelsugary
goodness
vanilla
and
theres
a
balance
w
dry
roasted
malt
bitter
and
sweet
fruit
tastes
come
through
mostly
some
tart
cherry
notes
and
the
beer
passes
huskily
over
the
tongue
with
a
touch
of
stickiness
although
some
sips
gave
off
a
sour
funky
not
in
a
bad
way
backbite
a
sturdy
sipper
i
took
my
time
w
and
enjoyed
d
delicious
a
sipper
for
sure
this
is
my
favorite
beer
brewed
in
maryland
period
o
this
is
a
really
great
barleywine
anyone
who
likes
this
style
owes
it
to
themselves
to
pick
this
beer
up
im
impressed
and
will
definitely
look
for
this
one
again
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
and
a
touch
of
lacing
though
most
of
the
head
fades
into
a
thin
color
some
light
legs
as
well
the
nose
is
really
quite
plain
with
only
a
bit
of
bread
and
some
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
mildly
sweet
and
has
a
bit
of
light
booze
moderate
caramel
and
brown
sugar
there
as
well
mild
cherry
in
the
back
end
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
not
bad
but
not
particularly
good
either
2010
vintage
pours
a
mostly
clear
medium
amber
with
plenty
of
thick
creamcolored
head
great
head
retention
and
lacing
some
active
carbonation
fruity
citrus
aroma
up
front
very
sweet
smelling
with
berry
notes
as
well
as
floral
hoppiness
hints
of
malt
lurk
in
the
background
but
this
one
is
all
hops
pretty
much
the
flavor
comes
on
with
a
strong
malt
profile
plenty
of
bread
and
dark
fruit
notes
a
cherrylike
cloying
sweetness
quickly
follows
only
partially
covered
up
with
sweet
citrus
and
floral
hops
a
tad
bitter
but
not
nearly
enough
for
the
cloying
sweetness
this
one
had
great
potential
but
is
just
too
sweet
for
me
o
i
went
to
one
of
the
duclaw
alehouses
this
past
weekend
and
have
a
new
found
interest
in
their
beers
after
the
quality
ones
i
had
there
this
one
didnt
disappoint
d
pretty
good
drinkability
its
just
too
hot
tasting
needs
a
long
nap
not
too
expensive
but
it
sits
next
to
old
guardian
and
old
ruffian
at
the
store
for
the
same
price
so
duclaw
devils
milk
has
a
lovely
amberorange
colour
and
a
head
that
fades
in
seconds
a
small
amout
of
lacing
remains
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
roasted
malt
and
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
this
beer
starts
with
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
charcoal
chocolate
orange
the
flavour
develops
some
citrus
character
in
the
middle
but
the
maltiness
remains
the
strongest
flavour
there
is
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
this
beer
feels
thick
and
syruppy
in
my
mouth
its
a
delicious
beer
but
its
for
sipping
d
i
suppose
that
after
a
few
years
this
ages
beautifully
i
can
assume
that
the
booziness
settles
down
and
the
dry
nature
fades
a
little
otherwise
being
a
year
old
it
isnt
bad
either
maturity
would
certainly
do
this
well
but
it
drinks
rather
effortlessly
at
this
point
d
this
was
a
nice
bold
and
balanced
barleywine
it
had
solid
body
but
it
was
a
bit
hot
so
it
was
better
to
sip
there
wasnt
anything
really
unique
about
it
but
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
d
disappointing
in
many
ways
but
mainly
in
missing
an
opportunity
to
produce
a
more
distinctive
beer
it
is
good
but
doesnt
push
greatness
at
all
the
malt
component
is
too
mellow
and
lacks
the
power
expected
from
this
style
had
on
tap
at
the
brewery
and
at
a
beer
tasting
event
in
md
i
remember
this
being
my
first
bold
beer
from
duclaw
which
was
a
big
hit
at
the
festival
when
it
unveiled
and
went
out
in
about
half
hour
or
less
pours
a
big
deep
orange
color
with
some
red
hues
big
frothy
slightly
off
white
heads
with
lots
of
lacing
aroma
is
nice
full
of
big
and
bold
hops
a
big
punch
of
citrus
and
flowers
with
a
nice
caramel
malt
backbone
slight
hint
of
yeast
as
well
flavor
is
bitter
and
sweet
at
once
and
finishes
thick
and
creamy
on
the
palate
everything
about
this
brew
is
big
bold
and
full
of
hops
the
alcohol
warms
but
isnt
overly
boozy
a
good
bold
beer
i
will
need
to
try
it
from
the
bottle
one
day
perhaps
in
the
fall
d
that
mouthfeel
that
i
actually
love
does
take
a
hit
on
the
drinkability
not
only
that
but
halfway
through
that
alcohol
causes
another
negative
tick
mark
to
come
through
averages
it
out
to
be
average
i
like
it
just
isnt
amazing
it
was
fun
to
tick
and
for
a
brewery
no
one
really
talks
about
im
happy
with
what
theyve
done
d
not
necessarily
my
favorite
style
approach
to
a
beer
the
sweet
and
citrus
combination
doesnt
blend
very
well
but
this
is
more
sessionable
than
most
barleywines
sticky
medium
body
with
enough
carbonation
not
a
problem
drinking
this
adequate
amount
of
warming

nice
barleywine
pours
a
hazy
deep
amber
with
a
slight
sticky
head
the
aroma
is
rich
and
pruny
with
a
sharp
sweet
malt
the
flavor
is
very
hot
and
spicy
with
a
rich
sweet
peppery
malt
with
prune
and
apple
and
mulled
cider
there
is
a
hot
peppery
bitterness
and
a
boozy
sting
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
gooey
d
i
think
often
times
hop
forward
barleywines
are
prone
to
awkward
phases
between
3
and
9
months
after
bottling
the
hop
flavors
have
faded
leaving
strong
flavorless
bitterness
behind
meanwhile
the
malts
havent
had
time
to
come
together
either
with
no
date
on
the
bottle
i
cant
say
for
sure
that
is
what
happened
here
its
just
speculation
on
my
part
pours
a
sort
of
hazy
ruddy
brown
with
a
1
cm
head
tan
colored
that
falls
back
pretty
fast
not
much
lacing
looks
to
be
the
norm
but
nothing
beyond
it
there
the
smell
is
nice
toasted
sweet
nuts
come
to
mind
with
bits
of
orange
zest
and
peel
and
some
sweet
berry
flavors
as
well
i
get
a
lot
of
caramel
in
the
smell
with
raisins
and
a
little
bit
of
crackery
smell
too
this
one
has
a
hefty
malt
presence
with
a
slighty
fruity
hoppiness
the
taste
has
a
bit
more
of
the
hoppiness
that
has
come
to
be
the
norm
in
an
american
barleywine
its
like
eating
pollen
coated
cake
the
bitterness
is
not
too
strong
thanks
to
the
incredible
sweetness
but
it
does
a
great
job
of
balancing
there
is
definitely
a
flowery
presence
and
the
consistent
orange
is
vary
nice
in
this
the
malt
is
still
the
winner
i
believe
which
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
very
bready
and
very
raisiny
as
well
with
a
slightly
drying
finish
despite
the
heavy
sweetness
up
front
the
body
is
a
nice
medium
with
pretty
low
carbonation
which
helps
to
sort
of
thicken
it
up
and
enhance
the
sweetness
the
alcohol
provides
a
nice
warmth
but
not
a
burn
really
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
though
way
too
strong
for
me
to
go
back
for
any
other
beer
after
it
d
i
appreciated
trying
this
and
it
was
not
a
bad
barleywine
but
for
the
style
i
could
think
of
many
that
outpace
this
i
prefer
a
bit
more
hop
in
an
american
if
that
is
what
the
brewer
intended
but
it
is
possible
the
beer
has
a
little
age
on
it
nice
barleywine
thanks
for
the
taste
mughugger

thanks
to
lackenhauser
for
this
one
d
this
is
a
really
good
tasting
barleywine
i
would
like
to
find
more
beers
from
duclaw
dthis
is
quite
tasty
and
has
a
big
hop
profile
it
would
be
an
interesting
brew
to
age
but
this
one
is
quite
tasty
fresh
and
has
a
very
pleasing
feel
very
solid
beer
and
great
example
of
an
american
style
barleywine
big
thanks
to

gmcc2181
for

this
growler
pours
clear
copper
with
thin
off
white
head
the
mild
aroma
is
full
of
citrus
hops
spicy
to
earthy
hops
and
some
slick
malt
sweetness
the
taste
starts
out
with
smooth
earthy
to
grassy
hop
flavor
and
then
the
bitterness
begins
to
pick
up
by
midway
slick
sweet
maltiness
murmurs
up
in
the
background
to
provide
a
pleasing
level
of
support
for
the
tasty
load
of
hops
nice
american
style
barleywine
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
offering
from
duclaw
and
it
is
nice
to
see
bottles
finally
on
the
shelf
recommended
pours
a
ruddy
amber
with
just
a
finger
of
head
the
aroma
is
very
hoppy
the
taste
reminds
me
a
lot
of
bigfoot
from
sierra
nevada
on
the
hoppy
end
of
the
spectrum
as
far
as
barleywines
go
would
be
much
easier
to
drink
except
for
the
tongue
curling
syrupy
thickness
its
a
good
drinker
but
the
thickness
forces
me
to
treat
this
as
a
sipper
probably
would
just
get
bigfoot
instead
of
this
in
the
future
drinks
very
well
here
a
light
bite
on
the
very
end
but
at
11
is
great
very
drinkable
though
slightly
more
carbonated
than
other
barleywines
ive
had
before
one
i
definitely
will
have
again
aroma
is
sweet
fruity
and
alcoholic
taste
starts
with
fruity
sweetness
moderate
pine
hops
bite
makes
a
good
presence
in
the
middle
and
close
is
warming
but
not
overpowering
mouthfeel
is
possibly
a
touch
too
slick
could
use
a
bit
more
body
but
drinkability
is
excellent
for
a
brew
of
these
levels
dare
i
say
this
is
a
balanced
11
brew
great
stuff
notes
lack
of
bottling
date
aside
this
seems
to
be
a
late
09
or
very
early
10
release
it
is
actually
a
good
representation
of
what
has
become
for
some
a
standard
of
the
us
barleywine
style
i
e
a
sturdy
malt
range
with
an
equally
assertive
hop
profile
luckily
for
this
one
there
is
a
back
and
forth
between
both
ranges
and
the
hoppiness
does
not
take
over
entirely
given
a
pretty
nice
sweet
range
and
when
it
is
in
command
it
still
has
a
nice
sweet
identity
as
an
undercurrent
a
bit
of
aging
smoothing
the
hop
profile
might
make
this
a
much
better
rounded

of

this
one
is
a

lacking

definitely
pick

i
had
it
with
dill
creamed
salmon
with
walnuts
smelled
kind
of
like

built
up

alot

this

was

it
hoppier
than
usual
it
looks
like
a
brown
ale
and
has
a
modest
head
that
soon
disipates
its
hoppy
with
an
almost
citrus
flavor
and
added
sweetness
to
compensate
to
me
it
was
similar
to
an
american
ipa
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
despite
the
high
alcohol
drinkability
very
american
and
very
straightforward
in
its
delivery
of
brash
hop
bitterness
and
ubiquitous
alcohol
presence
from
a
growler
pours
a
ambercopper
color
with
a
small
mostly
white
head
smells
gloriously
hoppy
first
sip
is
all
hops
backed
with
a
ton
of
malts
carbonation
is
low
most
likely
from
being
in
a
growler
the
abv
is
not
hidden
it
is
in
your
face
very
well
balanced
for
the
style
tasty
and
clean
this
beer
is
getting
better
as
it
warms
dwithout
question
a
different
beer
with
2
years
on
it
than
when
it
is
fresh
while
i
prefer
the
fresh
version
with
its
stand
out
hop
blast
i
did
enjoy
this
now
caramelbrown
sugar
malt
bomb
a
nice
sipper
and
a
good
one
to
share
with
friends
this
is
imho
probably
the
best
offering
that
duclaw
puts
out
during
the
year
a
robust
american
barleywine
with
great
strength
behind
it
yet
remaining
a
steady
and
warming
sipper
my
only
complaint
is
that
they
serve
this
way
to
cold
let
it
warm
up
and
enjoy
good
stuff
that
im
hoping
to
grab
a
couple
more
glasses
of
this
winter
before
its
gone
d
definitely
a
sipper
but
arent
all
barleywines
i
found
this
one
to
be
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
however
one
snifter
was
enough
for
me
this
definitely
benefitted
from
a
bit
of
aging
in
my
opinion
d
at
11
this
beer
is
meant
for
sharing
deuane
ffejherb
ksak
and
i
all
enjoyed
sipping
on
this
one
notes
from
121205
a
very
nice
sipper
that
everyone
enjoyed
still
have
another
bottle
in
the
cellar
this
one
has
held
up
well
aroma
smacked
me
with
the
sweet
malty
caramel
moderated
with
a
pine
hop
sweet
bw
smooth
and
slipping
down
like
a
2
year
old
on
the
playground
slide
no
idea
that
this
packs
a
11
wallop
very
hard
just
to
sip
just
a
tasty
easy
drinking
brew
one
and
done
for
sure
but
i
look
forward
to
having
another
somewhat
similar
to
old
ruffian
or
maybe
a
mix
of
dfh
90
120
lives
in
that
zone
of
a
very
sweet
dipa
or
a
very
bitter
barleywine
very
good
and
will
have
to
invite
the
devil
to
the
holiday
celebrations
expected
a
much
stronger
taste
based
on
past
barleywine
ales
was
unbelieveably
smooth
and
drinkable
would
have
had
2
had
the
first
one
not
gone
directly
to
my
head
followed
it
up
with
a
porter
to
finish
out
the
visit
had
just
stopped
by
to
fill
up
growlers
for
tailgating
and
decided
to
stay
for
one
or
two
this
certainly
hides
the
alcohol
quite
well
i
never
would
have
guessed
it
was
near
12
though
this
would
never
be
mistaken
for
a
light
weight
the
hop
character
is
still
fairly
vibrant
and
this
certainly
has
not
picked
up
much
age
or
oxidation
yet
this
beer
becomes
more
enjoyable
as
time
goes
on
it
has
become
a
fitting
beer
to
end
the
night
on
chestnut
red
in
color
with
2cm
of
rich
white
head
served
in
a
regular
8
oz
glass
smells
of
sweet
caramel
and
spices
a
very
strong
spice
flavor
with
a
caramel
sweet
finish
alcohol
presence
noticeable
very
sweet
with
a
medley
of
spices
in
each
sip
great
taste
lovely
lacing
on
the
glass
worth
a
drink
each
year
when
its
released
im
sad
i
gave
a
3
5
on
the
drinkability
this
is
probably
more
my
prefernce
than
anything
but
it
seemed
just
a
little
tiny
bit
too
sweet
syrupy
for
my
taste
with
the
style
while
im
going
to
love
the
growler
for
a
beer
that
doesnt
come
in
bombers
64oz
will
be
just
a
bit
too
much
for
1
person
over
2
days
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
fullbodied
sticky
sweet
then
some
pucker
in
the
middle
and
some
astringency
in
the
finish
with
residual
stickyonthelips
sweetness
pleasant
sipping
drinkability
is
ok
but
if
i
had
wanted
a
second
beer
it
would
have
been
venom
apa
deceptively
drinkable
make
no
mistake
this
is
one
big
beer
overall
i
didnt
dislike
the
beer
it
needs
to
be
bottled
aged
and
come
back
to
very
aggressive
beer
even
for
the
style
had
this
from
a
snifter
at
xmas
in
july
pours
a
dark
burgandybrown
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
small
ring
no
lacing
to
speak
of
nice
fruity
noseoranges
pineapples
grapes
figs
all
marked
with
a
distinctive
alcohol
as
the
beer
warmed
a
little
a
floral
hop
scent
emerged
taste
is
a
deep
sweet
caramel
malt
infused
with
dark
fruits
balanced
by
a
decently
strong
hop
bite
alcohol
makes
itself
known
from
the
getgo
and
is
a
little
to
agressive
for
my
tastes
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
fine
carbonation
level
this
feels
great
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
very
good
effort
by
duclaw
at
the
style
had
this
at
the
maryland
springfest
05
it
has
a
nice
dark
ruby
complexion
and
the
head
goes
away
fast
the
volunteers
pouring
this
were
wasting
too
much
of
it
as
i
stood
in
line
it
pissed
me
off
i
wish
one
of
the
brewers
would
have
said
something
another
thing
was
that
i
bought
a
devils
milk
snifter
and
they
wouldnt
pour
the
beer
in
it
so
i
had
to
transfer
from
my
plastic
cup
into
the
snifter
at
11
this
barleywine
that
has
several
months
on
it
still
seems
rough
it
is
definatley
an
american
as
the
bold
c
hops
are
present
and
there
is
some
nice
sweetness
left
in
the
malt
the
alcohol
comes
through
a
little
too
much
as
the
malt
cant
contain
it
and
the
hops
cant
mute
it
an
enjoyable
barleywine
something
i
would
buy
on
occasion
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
mouthfilling
unctous
almost
and
so
i
would
have
to
call
this
a
sipping
brew
rather
like
a
fine
cognac
drinkability
not
very
smooth
or
contemplative
very
raw
for
an
aged
barleywine
this
is
a
rude
american
interpretation
appearance
was
quite
good
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
special
devils
milk
release
glass
a
11oz
logoed
challice
nice
touch
smell
was
marked
by
a
strong
alcohol
scent
along
with
some
firece
hops
taste
was
good
the
archtypical
webstersdefinition
barley
wine
flavor
perhaps
this
beer
was
served
too
early
to
have
developed
any
real
character
of
its
own
pretty
easy
to
drink
down
too
itd
be
easy
to
forget
about
the
11
abv
overall
devils
milk
is
really
only
a
standout
as
a
bonefide
barley
wine
being
brewed
and
served
by
a
chain
brewpub
well
worth
a
drink
if
its
on
tap
but
not
worth
an
outoftheway
trip
to
the
brewers
this
years
devils
milk
was
a
little
bit
disappointing
so
ill
have
to
be
sure
to
try
it
again
next
year
its
short
head
of
creamy
offwhite
foam
receeds
quickly
as
might
be
expected
considering
its
strength
but
it
still
leaves
some
limited
splashes
of
lace
about
the
snifter
the
hazy
mahogany
body
appears
darkish
on
the
bar
or
table
but
reveals
a
glowing
ring
of
orangeish
gold
at
the
rim
as
you
raise
the
glass
to
your
lips
the
aroma
offers
some
dried
apricot
and
tart
baking
apples
acetaldehyde
along
with
a
waft
of
alcohol
over
a
limited
amount
of
malt
the
body
is
medium
and
its
soft
in
the
mouth
with
a
fine
carbonation
its
flavor
delivers
a
wellbalanced
combination
of
alcohol
bitterness
and
straightforward
just
slightly
carameltouched
malt
it
finishes
dry
with
some
lingering
malt
bitterness
and
apple
dark
amber
with
plenty
of
sweetness
and
complex
malt
notes
pours
with
a
thick
head
and
parallelline
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
mouthfeel
is
beautiful
and
one
almost
regrets
having
to
swallow
when
you
do
the
ample
sweetness
gradually
fades
and
leaves
a
tangy
finish
overall
among
my
favorite
barleywines
with
almost
no
taste
of
the
warming
alcohol
overall
the
booze
is
intense
i
am
a
barleywine
fan
and
a
barleywine
drinker
i
can
drink
more
than
one
in
a
single
sitting
but
im
not
so
sure
about
this
one
with
my
fiancé
not
here
to
help
me
polish
this
bomber
off
im
not
so
sure
its
going
to
happen
however
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
especially
with
a
little
st
agur
blue
cheese
22oz

this
one
pours
a
dark

there
was
almost

is
pretty

i
think
i
might
be
growing
tired
of
sweeter
beers
as
this
just
isnt
doing
much
for
me
a
year
ago
would
have
been
a
different
story
there
is
a
very
faint
bitter
finish
but
the
sweetness
hangs
around
to
the
bitter
end
pun
intended
this
beer
lacks
stability
and
complexity
but
the
flavors
go
together
at
least
somewhat
well
not
a
good
beer
but
at
3
99
it
competes
with
even
worse
malt
liquors
for
a
cheap
buzz
okay
for
the
price
but
overall
bad
i
love
a
barleywine
this
one
is
a
murky
dark
brown
color
its
mostly
still
with
just
a
little
carbonation
and
nearly
no
head
at
all
the
aroma
is
all
malt
and
alcohol
sweet
grainy
maltextractlike
toffee
and
biscuit
caramel
and
rumsoaked
raisins
the
beer
is
warm
and
has
a
bite
but
also
very
sweet
firm
bitterness
for
balance
the
sweetness
is
lingering
its
a
sensation
that
hangs
on
for
several
minutes
firm
body
this
is
a
solid
but
not
particularly
outstanding
barleywine
aged
3
5
years

d
this
beer
is
completely
unoffensive
and
unassuming
its
boring
without
being
bad
i
didnt
really
expect
it
to
be
any
good
either
given
the
brewer
i
figured
i
could
get
a
spot
back
in
my
cellar
by
drinking
this
and
in
that
regard
this
is
a
success
overall
i
seem
to
like
this
more
than
others
have
rated
maybe
because
i
like
cherry
certainly
not
the
best
barleywine
but
well
worth
the
5
dollars
in
fact
this
is
the
most
obscure
barleywine
i
have
had
to
date
overall
just
not
a
very
enjoyable
experience
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
barley
wine
that
is
not
overpowering
and
would
likely
be
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
aging
this
one
might
be
a
very
good
idea
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
almost
no
head
and
decent
lacing
aroma
is
of
cherries
oak
hops
barley
some
chocolate
vanilla
and
a
hint
of
a
tobacco
smell
very
boozey
smelling
mouthfeel
is
slightly
heavy
but
tolerable
taste
is
of
pretty
much
all
of
the
aroma
and
a
good
amount
of
booze
however
sometimes
it
feels
slightly
watered
down
i
prefer
a
few
other
barleywines
but
this
one
at
least
passes
while
not
the
most
complex
of
barleywines
its
a
rich
and
enjoyable
sipper
the
peppery
taste
was
a
nice
addition
however
it
almost
got
to
the
point
of
cloyingly
sweet
my
wife
and
i
had
trouble
finishing
the
bottle
very
delicious
but
also
rich
and
potentially
cloying
not
something
to
drink
a
lot
of
or
drink
quickly
a
little
boozy
as
well
a
good
treat
for
fans
of
english
barleywines
which
this
tastes
much
more
like
despite
being
called
an
american
bw
o
this
is
a
fantastic
and
way
underrated
barleywine
you
can
feel
it
change
as
it
warms
up
gets
stickier
citrusier
and
deliciousier
lol
all
kidding
aside
for
4
4922oz
this
should
be
rated
way
higher
than
it
is
its
not
hoppy
enough
to
be
an
american
bw
yet
not
quite
sweet
and
sugary
enough
to
be
an
english
bw
perfect
balance
and
so
friggin
delicious
i
know
where
im
going
tomorrow
back
to
my
local
to
buy
the
rest
of
what
they
have
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
dcreeper
for
sure
shared
but
one
serving
was
more
than
enough
recommended
drinkability
is
good
so
far
but
i
have
a
third
of
the
bomber
left
in
the
bottle
still
i
dont
anticipate
finishing
this
will
be
a
problem
decent
brew
but
i
still
prefer
brooklyns
barleywine
and
english
styles
in
general
d
pretty
high
for
10
5
abv
not
as
good
as
say
owd
engwish
or
olde
school
but
certainly
quaffable
overall
a
great
english
style
barleywine
with
rediculously
rich
malt
flavor
and
excellent
balance
from
english
hops
alcoholic
strength
is
definitely
evident
and
slightly
limits
drinkability
but
not
overwhelming
would
like
to
lay
a
bottle
of
this
down
for
a
year
or
two
just
to
see
how
it
does
but
its
drinking
nice
the
year
it
was
bottled
quite
nice
a
more
subltle
barley
wine
poured
a
medium
sized
light
tan
foamy
frothy
head
that
settle
out
after
a
bit
and
some

a
very
nice
clear
garnet
with
red
highlights
aroma
is
dry

bitter
malt
with

is
similar
to

but
has
some
sweetness
behind
the
up
front
bitterness

soft
carbonation

to
work
well
finish

pretty

this
one
follows
the
english
barleywine
style
better
than
the
american
barleywine
booziness
definitely
cuts
the
drinkability
on
this
one
t
this
is
a
malty
brew
that
has
been
aged
to
perfection
it
has
a
nice
tart
aftertaste
very
smooth
sugary
mixed
with
alcohol
d
good
i
would
certainly
have
another
if
i
was
craving
a
solid
characteristic
barleywine
the
drinkability
is
good
for
a
barleywine
not
too
syrupy
and
not
too
thin
solid
drinkability
very
solid
for
a
barley
wine
and
probably
my
favorite
mendocino
beer
wish
i
wouldve
gotten
another
bottle
i
think
it
was
only
around
5
too
which
now
seems
like
a
steal
for
this
wonder
what
some
age
would
do
too
d
definitely
aggressive
but
very
satisfying
pretty
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
decent
but
only
slightly
above
average
for
the
style
overall
hop
start
with
malt
sweet
malt
finish
another
fine
barley
wine
style
ale
from
talon
brewing
taste
the
hop
is
on
the
spicy
side
malt
is
sturdy
but
not
too
heavy
a
lighter
barleywine
not
bulky
but
enjoyable
sweet
grows
into
a
woodier
feel
malt
takes
a
more
prominent
spot
over
sweetness
very
drinkable
barleywine
extremely
affordable
dthis
is
probably
not
one
that
id
revisit
except
maybe
with
some
age
on
it
the
finish
is
a
little
too
dry
for
my
taste
and
this
really
hurts
the
drinkability
for
me
im
having
a
hard
time
finishing
this
one
mouthfeel
is
heavy
body
thick
very
smooth
drinkability
at
this
abv
not
very
however
i
have
to
say
at
the
start
of
the
bottle
i
wasnt
digging
this
beer
a
whole
lot
now
that
im
half
way
through
its
really
growing
on
me
id
like
to
see
more
carbonation
and
aroma
to
give
it
a
little
extra
something
im
not
blown
away
by
it
however
its
one
i
would
definitely
get
a
few
more
bottles
of
the
bittersweet
finish
is
really
interesting
mahogany
color
clear
sticky
foam
down
to
a
few
wisps
eventually
smells
of
sweet
malts
very
sugary
molasses
taste
is
bready
malts
followed
by
brown
sugar
almost
a
cocacolalike
sweetness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
no
substantial
hop
presence
i
could
liken
it
to
having
a
very
chocolatey
piece
of
cake
without
anything
to
drink
esp
not
milk
that
seems
to
be
a
major
downfall
of
the
lessthanstellar
barleywines
the
abv
is
well
hidden
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
carbonation
is
smooth
drinkability
is
hurt
by
the
lack
of
a
superior
balance
local
beer
so
im
proud
to
have
tried
it
mendocino
talon
is
a
super
clear
dense
amber
ale
with
a
dense
yellow
head
that
leaves
excellent
lacing
it
has
a
sweet
resiny
wooden
aroma
with
notes
of
stone
fruit
and
black
pepper
its
full
bodied
smooth
and
syrupy
with
a
sticky
finish
its
very
well
balanced
a
little
sweet
like
plum
a
little
bitter
like
pine
the
peppery
alcohol
provides
a
long
finish
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
west
coast
barleywine
i
had
no
problem
finishing
the
bomber
but
it
took
awhile
this
is
a
sipper
and
a
good
one
to
add
to
the
onceinawhile
roster
this
shows
a
golden
brown
cream
soda
color
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
and
okay
slivers
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
deep
nutty
red
wine
even
a
little
woodsy
root
very
intense
and
tempting
the
flavor
comes
on
with
thick
almost
chocolatey
nutty
merlot
i
get
some
molasses
and
currant
fairly
full
bodied
with
a
slightly
satin
feel
and
polite
carbonation
this
is
not
a
session
beer
but
its
so
tasty
that
it
can
disappear
more
quickly
than
it
probably
should
one
quick
sip
at
a
time

very
successful
effort

in
the
flavor

use
some
more

to
balance
out

found
this
beer
to
be
lacking

sticky

alcohol
is
strong

brandylike
though
not
unpleasant
hop

is
absent

there
is

syrupy
strange

worse
as
it

10

its
okay
as
far
as
being

goes
im
glad
that
ive
tried
it
but
i
think
ill
wait
awhile
before
trying
it
again
cellared
this
beer
develops
a
great
complexity
overall
a
pretty
decent
barleywine
i
wouldnt
pass
up
trying
again
blipped
in
our
talons
by
bowerbirds
bottle
pops
and
i
can
smell
the
dark
sugary
ripe
raisins
pours
a
deep
drown
with
little
head
that
fades
to
a
nice
lace
smell
is
a
deep
sugary
ripe

taste
is
very
sweet
caramel
and
brown

goes
down
smooth
not
peppery

its

moderately
bitter
finish
flavorful
up
front
but
then
starts
to
fade
somewhat
nice
clear
amber
color
with
thin
off
white
head
it
has
a
typical
barleywine
aroma
rich
sweet
malty
a
hint
of
hops
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
seems
right
on
for
the
style
and
heightens
the
anticipation
of
the
first
sip
yep
first
sip
and
it
is
good
full
mouth
feel
chewy
it
has
the
sweet
fruityness
of
maybe
grapes
or
cherries
then
comes
the
caramel
and
molasses
roasted
malt
flavors
to
keep
it
interesting
some
hop
bitterness
is
bouncing
around
the
taste
profile
the
finish
has
a
dry
biscuit
malt
flavor
along
with
some
residual
bitterness
and
alcohol
warmth
nice
beer
kind
of
thin
mouthfeel
for
a
barleywine
especially
considering
the
10
5
pours
a
clear
brown
with
no
head
strong
caramel
and
darker
fruits
in
the
aroma
with
some
brown
sugar
taste
is
good
but
not
balanced
syrupy
sweet
up
front
that
gets
more
sour
than
bitter
towards
the
back
kind
of
a
woody
flavor
as
well
alcohol
is
masked
well
good
not
great
d
damn
drinkable
id
personally
put
this
more
in
the
realm
of
english
barleywine
rather
than
american
as
the
hops
are
all
but
undetectable
at
least
in
this
bottle
i
have
not
a
mind
blowing
barleywine
but
pretty
cheap
and
not
too
bad
for
some
crazy
reason
this
brewer
keeps
drawing
me
in
every
time
i
see
a
new
mendocino
product
i
grab
it
no
doubt
due
to
tantalizing
abvs
and
very
competetive
pricing
generally
its
the
hop
profile
that
turns
me
off
but
not
this
time
halfway
through
the
bomber
this
barleywind
began
to
grow
on
me
but
now
towards
the
finish
line
im
second
guessing
aroma
is
decent
very
sweet
with
an
alcohol
push
dark
amber
pour
with
a
medium
brown
tint
minimal
head
and
no
lacing
drinking
this
makes
my
pucker
and
the
alcohol
really
stands
out
as
it
warms
hate
to
admit
but
the
alcohol
is
almost
too
overpowering
flavor
is
very
sweet
with
a
touch
of
sour
fruit
has
a
cheap
red
wine
quality
to
it
once
it
hits
room
temperature
the
strong
alcohol
is
really
too
much
to
bear
sturdy
son
of
a
gun
and
decent
for
the
clams
but
itll
make
a
man
out
of
ya
in
a
hurry
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
a
couple
of
times
before
today
last
winter
and
over
the
summer
but
dont
remember
the
sharpness
of
this
one
could
be
this
is
a
more
recent
vintage
that
has
not
yet
had
time
to
mellow
d
overall
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
barleywine
that
i
would
purchase
again
it
is
definately
a
sipper
so
it
is
one
bottle
and
out
for
me
recommended
note
its
my
day
off
its
noon
and
this
thing
is
whooping
my
butt
gotta
watch
those
10
abv
beers
theyll
sneak
up
on
ya
like
a
ninja
d
im
mildly
impressed
by
this
barleywine
in
what
i
assume
to
be
its
aged
state
good
one
for
the
snifter
id
like
to
try
one
fresh
and
compare
mouthfeel
is
oily
alcohol
warm
down
the
throat
a
sipper
for
sure
smoothsweetslightly
bitter
delicious
overall
have
to
say
this
one
was
not
bad
at
all
really
a
tight
little
barley
wine
here
almost
an
old
ale
but
not
quite
i
could
see
myself
having
this
one
again
in
the
near
future
opinion
i
kinda
wish
i
knew
how
old
this
beer
was
it
still
has
some
assertive
hops
but
i
know
that
it
is
at
least
two
years
old
in
my
fridge
i
wonder
how
drinkable
it
is
when
it
is
first
released
it
may
be
like
bigfoot
and
imo
will
take
at
least
three
years
to
mellow
out
to
where
it
is
even
drinkable
right
now
i
would
say
that
this
beer
is
in
its
prime
and
it
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
am
glad
i
waited
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
from
a
1
pint
6oz
bottle
produced
a
thin
head
that
dissipated
quickly
to
a
nonexistent
one
nice
chestnut
brown
color
strong
smell
of
fruit
as
soon
as
i
poured
taste
of
raisins
prunes
bitter
sweet
chocolate
finishing
with
black
pepper
warmth
im
new
to
this
style
of
brew
and
looking
forward
to
trying
some
more
different
bws
in
the
future
all
in
all
a
very
satisfying
experience
aroma
is
fairly
strong
and
fruity
rather
like
a
cider
with
some
yeasty
hints
color
is
a
rich
transparent
deep
brown
with
a
creamy
tan
head
flavor
is
wellrounded
and
fruity
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
hoppy
undertone
as
well
as
hints
of
caramel
and
smoke
the
alcohol
bite
is
strong
as
with
all
barleywines
but
not
vicious
texture
has
a
good
edge
to
it
and
this
barleywine
goes
down
the
hatch
with
fire
and
sass
22
oz
good
flavor
with
good
drinkability
for
the
style
worth
checking
out
for
the
barleywiners
d
if
you
like
barley
wine
you
will
probably
find
talon
enjoyable
the
alcohol
is
rather
noticeable
and
for
some
might
be
a
detractor
for
taste
but
i
found
it
wasnt
overly
harsh
if
nothing
else
at
10
5
it
will
catch
up
to
you
quickly
if
you
arent
careful
check
it
out
comparatively
inexpensive
and
readily
available
at
my
local
lowes
foods
savory
and
drinkable
d
probably
one
of
the
better
barley
wines
ive
had
in
a
while
highly
drinkable
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
so
be
careful
i
will
have
to
purchase
a
new
one
and
do
another
tasting
recommended
poured
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
decent
head
that
disappeared
to
nothing
in
about
5
minutes
or
so
the
nose
was
roasted
malts
and
lots
of
malt
at
that
decently
hopped
raisins
dried
fruits
other
than
raisins
haha
and
some
caramel
taste
was
a
blast
of
dried
fruit
prunes
and
raisins
even
very
sticky
it
seemed
not
that
full
bodied
but
heavy
in
malt
sense
a
pretty
up
front
bwine
malts
and
dried
fruit
a
slow
sipper
as
is
called
for
per
style
but
this
is
even
slow
for
style
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
among
barleywines
perhaps
a
bit
more
balance
would
help
drinkability
is
just
okay
it
needs
a
little
bit
of
hop
presence
at
least
as
well
as
a
slightly
thinner
mouthfeel
and
less
alcohol
flavor
at
the
end
hops
might
help
with
this
its
a
sipper
for
certain
this
poured
a
very
hazy
reddish
brown
with
a
fine
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
orange
and
hops
with
some
spice
it
tasted
sweet
and
spicy
with
a
little
bitterness
and
yeast
flavoring
the
aftertaste
was
mild
at
first
but
built
as
i
drank
with
an
apparent
taste
of
alcohol
the
texture
was
smooth
and
slightly
thick
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
especially
for
a
barleywine
terrific
stuff
more
than
holding
up
its
end
of
the
bargain
for
the
300th
review
drinkability
took
a
hit
due
to
the
slight
cloying
and
overbearing
taste
certainly
not
the
best
representation
of
the
style
that
ive
sampled
but
for
3
99
i
couldnt
go
wrong
worth
a
try
at
the
price
drinkabilitysort
of
once
in
a
while
beer
not
more
than
two
would
appease
me
a
bit
too
much
booze
as
a
barleywine
but
still
enjoyable
cellar
time
might
help
this
one
d
spicy
very
sweet
and
drinks
very
very
well
for
a
10
5
abv
ive
been
sitting
on
this
one
for
a
while
it
may
be
old
but
experience
tells
me
this
was
not
a
good
barleywine
even
when
fresh
i
would
never
buy
this
one
again
i
dont
think
age
screwed
it
up
that
bad

feels

thick

syrupy
with

which
might
have
been
ok
if
the
flavor
werent
so
brutal
this
is
a
powerful
harsh
brew
i
think
it
overdoes
it
not
a
fan
decent
but
not
too
much
going
on
here
for
sure
more
of
and
english
style
with
its
immense
sweetness
the
taste
gives
me
notes
of
caramel
malt
fig
toffee
roasted
malt
some
honey
some
molasses
and
a
slight
citrus
snap
in
the
background
it
has
a
medium

medium
thick
body
and
the
carbonation
is
medium
it
finishes
almost
syrupy
sweet
and
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
pretty
good
sample
of
the
style
im
pretty
impressed
with
how
long
the
foam
hangs
aroundits
still
a
solid
12
layer
far
into
the
session
longer
than
most
bwsas
ive
tried
i
think
it
could
use
just
a
smidgeon
more
of
a
hop
presence
to
balance
the
malt
but
as
is
its
pretty
good
would
i
seek
it
out
againas
its
not
available
locally
probably
not
d
a
good
version
of
a
barley
wine
not
my
favorite
but
a
good
one
overall
a
little
bit
heavyhanded
but
might
improve
a
lot
with
age
too
bad
i
have
no
way
to
know
how
old
it
is
ill
buy
this
one
again
overall
i
really
like
this
not
a
hop
monster
like
bigfoot
or
old
crusty
more
like
a
malt
monster
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
was
disappointed
with
this
offering
as
far
as
american
bw
this
is
completely
subpar
there
is
no
hop
flavor
or
aroma
blind
tastes
would
lend
me
toward
a
strong
doppelbock
or
maybe
even
a
scotch
ale
not
to
style
and
not
too
enjoyable
borderline
pricing
makes
this
somewhat
seductive
but
i
will
not
have
this
one
again
pours
dark
orange
with
a
nice
white
head
smells
slightly
pungent
with
spice
and
vanilla
malt
flavor
with
caramel
and
a
little
medicine
taste
packs
a
punch
with
the
alcohol
noticeable
as
might
be
expected
finishes
dry
i
must
admit
i
like
the
strength
of
the
flavor
but
cellaring
would
definitely
smooth
this
out
to
be
a
repeatable
try
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
rocky
tan
head
there
was
light
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
malt
and
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
and
caramel
as
well
much
more
malt
noticed
than
hops
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
in
both
the
taste
and
the
warming
effect
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
slightly
chewy
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
offering

although
i
would
consider
cellaring
the
next
bottle
for
a
year
or
so
d
a
bit
boozy
and
not
as
complex
as
it
should
be
but
not
bad
either
d
true
style
isnt
just
talk
this
beer
is
big
in
every
respect
definitely
a
sipper
not
just
because
of
the
prevalent
alcohol
but
because
it
needs
to
breath
and
warm
a
little
for
balance
maybe
i
should
of
left
this
one
sit
a
while
longer
but
my
stash
is
running
low
talon
true
style
barley
wine
ale
is
a
respectable
effort
that
nevertheless
falls
short
of
what
i
think
an
american
barleywine
should
deliver
since
there
are
any
number
of
good
versions
out
there
bigfoot
for
instance
is
practically
ubiquitous
i
cant
bring
myself
to
recommend
this
one
i
thought
that
the
complex
malty
character
and
sheer
fruitiness
set
this
one
apart
from
other
barley
wines
out
there
very
flavorful
if
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
im
betting
that
a
little
time
in
the
cellar
will
make
this
beer
absolutely
amazing
even
in
the
raw
form
it
is
in
today
it
is
quite
good
i
will
be
picking
up
more
of
this
talon
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
red
amber
with
a
thick
off
white
head
that
lingers
on
the
glass
aroma
is
sweet
dark
fruits
raisin
fig
and
some
toffee
taste
is
a
rich
caramel
maltiness
with
a
nice
almost
tart
hop
bite
very
well
balanced
this
beer
hides
the
alcohol
really
well
its
barely
perceptable
one
of
the
more
drinkable
barley
wines
ive
had
i
follow
the
hawk
22
oz
bottle
which
cost
me
4
50
i
poured
this
into
a
snifter
and
and
it
formed
a
decent
cream
colored
head
with
some
lacing
the
beer
was
ruby
red
in
color
the
smell
was
malty
and
sweet
the
taste
was
pretty
good
with
the
malts
and
a
honey
flavor
coming
through
the
taste
reminded
me
of
the
candy
bit
o
honey
this
was
a
pretty
good
barleywine
in
my
opinion
unfortunately
the
somewhat
offtaste
takes
away
from
the
overall
rating
not
to
mention
the
rough
character
of
the
mouthfeel
certainly
worth
checking
out
if
you
are
a
barely
wine
fan
but
otherwise
id
recommend
victorys
old
horizontal
or
weyerbachers
blithering
idiot
or
insanity
aged
blithering
idiot
the
body
is
thick
carbonation
is
very
mild
lots
of
residuals
leaves
a
weird
tangy
sensation
on
the
palate
for
long
after
this
is
probably
not
one
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
again
d
not
really
drinkable
a
definite
sipper
due
to
the
alcohol
taste
and
alcohol
content
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
d
not
very
couldnt
finish
the
bomber
although
i
did
have
three
beers
before
it
all
in
all
this
is
a
huge
surprise
from
mendocino
usually
i
find
their
beers
to
be
a
little
lacking
but
this
is
quite
tasty
complex
and
well
made
this
barleywine
really
tastes
as
if
its
already
a
year
or
two
old
id
like
to
see
what
this
does
in
another
couple
years
highly
recommended
as
i
popped
off
the
cap
the
carbonation
formed
a
head
in
the
bottle
pouring
it
revealed
a
lively
beer
with
a
one
finger
thick
head
in
the
goblet
and
a
clear
superbly
deep
red
body
no
murky
sediment
floating
in
the
first
pour
here
so
the
unspoilt
look
was
quite
nice
the
smell
was
clean
sweet
and
toasty
there
was
ghostly
remnant
of
hop
aroma
as
well
but
it
was
swept
aside
by
the
malt
the
taste
was
sultry
smooth
and
tongue
coatingly
sweet
raisins
plums
and
roasted
almonds
were
all
present
in
the
taste
and
were
melded
together
very
well
there
was
no
alcohol
apparent
in
the
taste
but
the
warmth
that
started
in
my
mid
section
after
just
a
few
sips
and
slowly
radiated
to
my
extremities
made
it
well
known
that
this
was
no
ordinary
beer
a
little
coarser
in
the
mouthfeel
than
i
was
anticipating
after
aging
for
this
long
but
i
wouldnt
say
it
was
harsh
this
double
digit
abv
barleywine
had
definitely
improved
for
the
better
and
i
could
see
it
going
for
a
few
more
years
i
believe
its
time
to
pick
up
the
next
bottle
and
start
the
experiment
over
again
my
overall
impression
ill
finish
the
bottle
but
i
probably
wont
buy
another
i
will
however
try
another
version
of
this
robust
brew
the
flavor
is
full
yet
somewhat
onedimensional
its
got
caramel
toffee
and
brown
sugar
to
it
and
some
nondescript
hop
character
and
not
too
bad
drinkability

not
a
bad
choice
but
im
not
sure
i
will
be
revisiting
this
anytime
soon
maybe
i
will
try
an
aged
bottle
in
the
future
drinkability
its
a
good
beer
to
catch
a
buzz
on
and
thats
about
it
i
probably
wont
finish
the
bomber
and
doubt
ill
buy
another
pours
a
deep
mahogony
brown
into
my
snifter
with
a
tiny
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
smells
sweet
fruit
some
spice
and
a
tingle
of
pine
no
noticable
alcohol
presence
taste
is
up
front
sweet
caramel
and
dark
fruits
it
is
not
nearly
as
hoppy
as
some
other
american
barleywines
i
have
had
but
is
a
nice
change
from
the
ordinary
you
can
have
this
beer
as
a
nice
after
dinner
drink
its
clean
not
overly
cloying
the
hop
oils
are
there
yet
dont
linger
very
drinkable
plus
the
price
is
a
steal
at
3
99
a
bomber
drink
up
d
i
wasnt
expecting
much
for
a
barleywine
that
sells
for
2
99
per
bomber
so
i
cant
say
that
i
was
too
disapointed
not
awful
just
boring
doverall
a
nice
bw
that
i
could
enjoy
again
a
bit
a
harsh
but
decent
enough
finally
got
my
hands
on
a
couple
of
bottles
a
few
months
back
pours
a
nice
dark
ruby
reddish
color
nice
carbonation
small
tan
head
which
does
not
last
long
lacing
consists
of
islands
all
around
the
glass
scents
of
sweet
malts
hops
prunes
raisins
alcohol
and
slight
caramel
the
taste
is
sweetslightly
tangy
a
touch
of
caramel
ends
with
a
dry
finish
medium
body
a
nice
complex
brew
drinkable
i
really
enjoy
this
brew
well
done
mendocino
would
recommend
drinkability
i
bet
you
could
age
this
for
about
20
years
with
all
of
the
alcohl
that
is
here
and
it
probably
would
get
better
with
age
not
bad
but
not
very
good
vs
the
abw
style
this
needed
more
age
time
or
more
malt
maybe
both
this
didnt
strike
me
as
a
great
abw
but
it
certainly
is
good
and
well
worth
drinking
a
fine
example
of
the
style
overall
im
not
too
impressed
there
are
better
barleywines
out
there
than
this
one
the
aroma
had
me
at
hello
but
the
flavor
slipped
a
couple
teeth
the
alcohol
is
oppressive
enough
to
keep
much
of
the
flavor
submerged
or
at
least
considerably
less
apparent
but
to
be
fair
what
does
surface
is
nice
if
limited
the
abv
not
only
warms
but
wallops
as
well
i
enjoyed
it
well
enough
its
just
not
my
first
choice
is
all
chriminy
are
there
any
hops
in
this
beer
its
freaking
sweet
it
looks
great
with
a
ruby
body
and
offwhite
head
smells
of
massive
malt
sweet
rich
almost
a
syruplike
boldness
to
the
flavor
it
took
my
a
few
sips
to
get
used
to
this
beer
there
are
apple
and
berry
flavors
but
the
malt
is
a
little
much
maybe
itll
mellow
out
after
a
few
years
to
its
credit
there
isnt
much
of
an
alcohol
flavor
split
a
bomber
if
you
like
barleywines
i
wont
say
i
wont
give
it
another
try
perhaps
ill
split
a
bottle
this
christmas
with
my
barleywine
loving
friend
but
i
wont
actively
seek
it
out
for
myself
either
sweet
totally
unbalanced
abv
is
well
covered
lacking
in
hops
i
would
think
this
a
british
barley
wine
rather
than
an
american
appearance
is
clear
reddish
amber
with
a
thick
head
aroma
is
caramel
and
toasted
malts
flavor
is
just
sweet
molasses
like
perhaps
and
grainy
mouthfeel
is
nice
thick
and
smooth
drinakbility
is
high
as
the
palate
gets
used
to
the
sweetness
after
a
while
exits
the
bottle
an
attractive
ruby
redorange
color
with
a
slight
haze
forms
a
thin
beige
head
which
quickly
fades
to
some
dispersed
isolated
blotches
of
foam
no
lacing
at
all
very
reserved
but
sweet
pleasant
aromas
of
sugar
daddy
caramel
candy
raisin
fig
brown
sugar
and
crystal
malts
with
a
slight
alcoholic
presence
palate
reveals
a
slightly
undercarbonated
flat
texture
with
a
bit
of
watery
thiness
sneaking
through
flavor
profile
starts
out
quite
sweet
with
notes
of
caramel
candy
buckwheat
honey
dark
dried
fruits
and
toasted
malts
followed
by
a
moderate
hop
resincitrus
rind
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
10
5
is
well
hidden
contributing
a
nice
balanced
warmth
at
the
end
at
3
99bomber
it
seems
like
a
good
value
this
beer
is
a
little
lighter
in
color
than
is
to
be
expected
of
the
style
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
head
the
smell
is
a
little
like
wine
the
taste
is
little
more
harsh
than
i
would
like
there
is
a
hot
alcohol
presence
and
the
many
flavors
just
do
not
mesh
the
mouthfeel
is
sour
and
not
what
i
would
expect
from
the
style
even
a
higher
abv
beer
such
as
this
the
drinkability
is
not
too
good
i
will
struggle
to
finish
the
bomber
as
this
may
become
a
drain
pour
this
is
more
like
the
bmc
of
barleywines
i
have
yet
to
have
an
offering
from
this
brewer
that
i
would
return
to
pours
a
beautiful
deep
dark
burgundybrownamber
with
a
very
thick
medium
head
of
very
tight
bubbles
that
has
fair
lasting
power
with
a
nice
lasting
lace
smells
like
its
overly
sweet
with
caramel
malts
and
no
hops
tastes
like
its
overly
sweet
with
caramel
malts
and
no
bittering
hops
hugely
alcoholic
in
the
mouth
with
a
thickly
sweet
raisin
alcohol
taste
to
it
overpowering
decidedly
not
balanced
great
thick
mouthfeel
but
i
couldnt
drink
a
second
of
these
not
even
2oz
at
a
time
yeh
right
drinkability

i
can
see
how
someone
would
hate
the
heck
out
of
this
abw
but
i
enjoy
obnoxious
efforts
at
the
style
like
this
the
body
is
copper
the
head
is
beige
and
lasts
for
a
minute
leaving
a
ring
of
lace
for
the
remainder
of
the
beer
the
nose
has
cherries
raspberries
caramel
malt
grassy
hops
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
fruitier
and
less
alcoholic
apples
and
grapes
join
the
cherries
and
berries
from
the
aroma
a
healthy
dose
of
hop
bitterness
comes
in
at
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
creamy
yet
dry
and
a
little
hot
from
the
alcohol
its
drinkable
for
the
style
but
its
still
more
of
a
nightcap
then
a
sessionable
brew
still
not
bad
better
than
an
average
for
sure
an
easy
pour
into
a
la
moneuse
glass
yields
a
bubbly
slow
fading
tan
head
atop
a
rich
translucent
deep
ruby
body
sparse
bubbles
rush
up
at
the
edges
to
join
the
diminishing
head
the
nose
is
wildly
full
of
caramel
and
sugar
which
nearly
hides
some
lovely
floral
hops
mildy
fruity
too
a
simple
yet
enjoyable
odor
taste
is
incredibly
sweet
very
full
of
caramel
almost
to
the
point
of
a
caramel
candy
aftertaste
hop
bitterness
balances
this
malt
bomb
towards
the
end
of
the
taste
progression
thankfully
alcohol
while
certainly
a
noticeable
flavor
component
doesnt
overwhelm
body
is
surprisingly
thin
for
a
beer
of
this
magnitude
perhaps
due
to
the
fact
that
carbonation
is
virtually
a
nonentity
this
beer
is
certainly
not
overly
complex
but
it
has
no
flaws
and
for
a
barleywine
exceptional
balance
this
has
been
in
the
cellar
for
about
a
year
and
a
half
frothy
lightbrown
head
that
mostly
diminished
dark
amber
color
light
bread
light
yeast
light
dough
aroma
also
raisin
date
tawny
port
aroma
heavy
sweet
initial
flavor
very
malty
and
completely
flat
carbonation
still
a
very
distinctive
alcohol
taste
not
great
but
not
awfull
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
any
more
of
these
alcohol
is
not
masked
in
the
flavor
as
it
is
in
the
aroma
applebrandy
dominates
coupled
with
a
spicy
alcohol
caramel
sweetness
as
well
as
a
yeasty
breadiness
this
has
a
somewhat
chewiness
to
it
due
to
the
thickness
of
the
brew
hops
are
more
prevalent
than
i
like
in
my
barley
wines
but
2
29bomber
this
is
worth
picking
up
a
few
to
see
how
it
improves
with
age
as
it
is
hot
now
overall
seems
strange
that
mendocino
would
slap
such
a
strong
brew
into
such
a
large
bottle
but
im
not
complaining
this
was
a
great
finish
to
the
evening
notes
starts
good
middle
is
nice
finish
is
disturbingly
overbearing
and
the
ending
will
ring
into
the
moring
hours
decent
in
my
book
but
as
far
as
barleywines
go
this
is
not
one
ill
pursue
pours
a
ruddy
dark
brown
and
clear
with
a
good
size
light
tan
head
some
tropical
fruit
and
sweet
sugary
caramel
malt
aroma
with
big
alcohol
also
in
the
smell
taste
is
well
balanced
a
little
bubble
gum
and
malt
sweetness
also
a
hint
of
piney
hops
and
a
nice
size
bite
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
the
alcohol
is
pushing
the
envelope
a
little
any
bigger
and
i
may
not
enjoy
it
but
at
this
level
it
is
a
nice
spicy
bite
in
the
finish
that
grows
stronger
as
it
reaches
room
temp
nice
beer
i
prefer
the
hop
character
in
a
barleywine
and
this
has
that
not
as
balanced
as
the
others
with
regards
to
alcohol
but
this
doesnt
bother
me
would
def
drink
again
relatively
good
stuff
thats
fairly
easy
drinking
for
a
barleywine
the
alcohol
is
never
really
present
or
overwhelming
i
notice
now
that
ba
recognizes
this
as
an
american
barleywine
i
think
itd
have
to
be
significantly
hoppier
to
qualify
for
that
category
otherwise
my
comments
stand
i
think
this
beer
was
made
in
2004
its
been
in
my
cellar
a
while
pours
a
half
finger
light
brown
head
over
a
cloudy
dark
amber
liquid
some
very
fine
particulates
suspendd
throughout
smells
of
soured
caramel
malt
and
alcohol
during
the
pour
to
the
nose
piney
grapefruit
hops
soured
caramel
rich
malt
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
sting
searing
my
nosehairs
tastes
piney
hops
wow
thats
amazing
after
all
this
time
mixed
amid
caramel
sweet
malt
esters
seem
dark
somehow
like
they
come
across
as
raisiny
delicious
wonderfully
smooth
body
the
alcohol
sting
is
a
bit
fuselly
rough
little
hop
bitter
but
this
beer
has
been
aged
i
enjoyed
what
i
had
but
didnt
need
another
why
well
piney
beers
arent
my
favorite
and
neither
are
american
bwines
judged
to
style
not
my
preferences
ponderous
but
true
to
the
style
i
would
recconmend
cellaring
this
mean
but
inviting
bw
drinkability
a
little
too
much
fusel
alcohol
to
be
easily
consumed
but
does
a
good
job
balancing
the
various
barleywine
elements
the
bottle
i
have
says
it
was
brewed
in
saratoga
springs
ny
this
barleywine
poured
a
dark
chestnut
red
with
a
small
head
that
lingered
in
the
glass
aroma
was
very
malty
and
fruity
with
a
hint
of
piney
hoppiness
the
taste
was
quite
malty
and
alcoholic
up
front
with
notes
of
caramel
dark
fruit
and
hop
bitterness
this
beer
was
full
bodied
and
rich
on
the
palate
i
gave
it
a
lower
rating
for
drinkability
because
the
alcohol
burn
was
a
little
over
the
top
consequently
i
think
this
beer
is
more
of
an
english
barleywine
because
maltiness
takes
centerstage
and
hops
are
more
in
the
foreground
regardless
it
was
a
bargain
at
2
49
for
a
22oz
bottle
d
pretty
good
this
is
not
a
fantastic
barleywine
but
it
is
an
enjoyable
brew
a
very
american
barleywine
for
sure
i
dont
know
exactly
what
true
style
means
it
tastes
pretty
good
what
else
matters
mouthfeel
when
fresh
from
the
fridge
it
is
very
syrupy
when
allowed
to
warm
it
has
a
more
beery
palate
the
start
is
predominantly
sweet
but
then
gives
way
to
some
hops
the
hops
flavor
i
cant
define
but
the
sweetness
is
dark
sugared
fruits
and
brown
sugar
not
exactly
the
best
sessionbeer
or
anything
considering
the
powerful
flavor
volume
1
pt
6
oz
and
the
high
abv
but
a
definite
treat
and
ignore
the
label
it
looks
like
a
totally
avoidable
malt
liquor
bomber
dont
pass
it
up
the
body
is
heavy
with
the
syrupy
taste
carbonation
was
on
talon
wasnt
a
sippers
beer
but
with
the
big
phenol
tastes
it
isnt
easy
to
go
through
quickly
either
a
pretty
solid
drinking
barleywine
at
a
very
reasonable
price
drinkability
a
sipper
but
deceptively
easy
going
down
more
like
an
english
than
an
american
bw
it
definitely
misses
the
style
mark
but
is
very
well
done
and
nicely
priced
pretty
good
sipping
beer
though
a
little
sweet
and
thick
for
my
taste
i
had
tried
this
once
before
and
didnt
really
care
for
it
but
gave
it
a
second
chance
tonightpoured
a
deep
clear
amber
with
a
thinner
slightly
off
white
head
that
is
gone
pretty
quickly
aromas
are
not
as
big
and
bold
as
alot
of
other
barley
wines
in
my
opinion
but
there
is
some
definent
caramel
and
brown
sugar
notes
there
with
a
very
noticable
alcohol
presence
thick
mouthcoating
mouthfeel
somewhat
stickya
very
sweet
caramel
flavor
really
hits
up
front
and
is
almost
overpowering
in
its
intense
sweetnessmolasses
and
brown
sugar
flavors
really
keep
this
brew
on
the
edge
of
being
cloying
there
is
a
real
alcohol
burning
sensation
as
it
goes
down
even
more
as
it
warmswell
its
big
and
flavorful
but
there
are
alot
better
american
barley
wines
out
there
for
sure
the
cherry
red
color
that
poured
from
this
bottle
had
me
intigued
right
from
the
start
and
the
smell
that
included
figs
and
orange
peel
really
got
me
going
the
taste
was
sublime
a
beer
with
perfect
balance
not
too
strong
not
too
bitter
but
doesnt
leave
you
flat
either
the
finish
was
strong
and
very
very
long
and
left
me
wanting
a
lot
more
than
just
one
22oz
bomber
the
alc
listed
was
10
5
abv
but
it
felt
like
a
lot
less
the
mouthfeel
was
good
toonot
thin
at
all
and
not
too
heavy
again
great
balance
throughout
id
like
to
see
how
well
it
ages
maybe
ill
put
a
few
down
in
the
cellar
and
try
next
year
oh
who
am
i
kidding
this
beer
is
too
good
to
wait
that
long
d
this
is
a
decent
barley
wine
that
i
suspect
would
be
better
if
i
had
let
it
sit
in
cellar
for
a
year
or
two
oh
well
more
potential
here
than
anything
a
bit
too
thin
and
a
bit
too
hoppy
right
now
let
it
mellow
and
try
it
again
not
bad
but
not
the
best
of
the
style
by
any
account
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
otherwise
nevermind
unless
its
cellared
for
a
season
or
two
body
is
medium
highly
carbonated
and
has
a
chewy
if
not
coarse
mouthfeel
decent
but
nothing
stands
out

forget
what
i
said
about
the
price
apparently
the
local
distributors
pulled
their
heads
out
of
their
asses
and
realized
that
they
were
undercharging
for
the
talon
and
the
price
jumped
everywhere
up
into
the
56
range
damn
its
still
an
easily
drinkable
bw
but
the
cost
is
much
more
average
than
it
used
to
be
on
the
bright
side
when
i
wrote
my
original
review
ba
listed
the
talon
as
discontinued
so
im
happy
to
see
that
its
back
in
regular
production
m
d
n
good
beer
anyhow
this
brew
poured
out
to
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
nice
tiny
bubbled
head
of
about
14
of
an
inch
medium
level
of
carbonation
smell
of
sweet
alcohol
grain
and
lightly
roasted
malts
tastes
like
it
smells
flavors
of
sweetness
and
grain
dominated
with
a
roasted
backbone
character
bitterness
toward
the
finish
strong
element
of
alcohol
and
astringent
thick
mouthfeel
was
like
a
scotch
ale
very
high
viscosity
with
a
syrupy
element
to
it
drinkability
is
average
i
could
take
or
leave
this
if
presented
with
it
again
drinkability
one
of
the
better
flavored
barleywines
i
have
had
in
a
while
if
i
still
could
find
it
i
may
buy
a
few
and
age
them
for
a
bit
longer
maybe
3
years
a
fairenough
barleywine
it
has
the
intense
sweet
barley
aroma
and
flavor
it
has
the
slick
and
sugary
mouthfeel
it
has
all
the
hops
in
the
world
the
hopping
gives
too
much
saltiness
and
metalic
flavorslikely
to
subside
with
time
deep
rich
fruity
characteristics
of
prunes
figs
raisons
and
nuts
citrusy
with
lemons
and
oranges
good
deep
copper
color
with
a
nice
1
off
white
head
still
not
well
melded
and
out
of
balance
with
the
hopping
a
basic
middleoftheroad
barleywine
nice
for
the
price
eh
its
drinkable
i
guess
basically
a
very
dull
aspirin
hop
flavored
barleywine
its
decent
and
drinkable
but
very
middle
of
the
road
no
wonder
they
discontinued
it
pretty
much
like
any
other
run
of
the
mill
american
barleywine
its
one
of
those
beers
that
a
lot
of
breweries
have
in
their
range
but
thats
pretty
much
where
it
stops
is
it
a
bad
beer
far
from
it
is
it
a
great
beer
not
that
either
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
not
much
head
or
carbonation
alcohol
and
malt
present
in
aroma
first
taste
very
sweet
some
ripe
fruits
a
little
bit
of
a
sweet
syrupy
aftertaste
lots
of
warming
alcohol
difficult
to
savor
even
sipping
because
of
intense
sweetness
and
wierd
aftertaste
id
rather
plunk
down
4
00
for
a
bottle
of
old
nicks
another
widely
available
midrange
barleywine
i
feel
like
this
is
a
tough
style
to
absolutely
master
but
then
again
lots
of
mendocino
brews
have
left
me
with
that
ehh
feeling
afterwards
so
i
guess
im
not
that
surprised
worth
a
try
for
the
hardcore
barleywine
nuts
but
other
than
that
theres
lots
of
other
things
to
spend
your
time
and
dime
on
clear
amber
in
color
with
ample
carbonation
and
a
mediumsized
offwhite
head
aroma
dominated
by
brown
sugar
light
fruity
notes
and
alcohol
altogether
too
sweet
and
sugary
in
flavor
a
bit
of
fruit
midpalate
but
just
too
much
sugary
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
a
harsh
alcohol
bite
on
the
backend
not
my
favorite
by
a
longshot
its
not
a
particularily
complex
barelywine
but
it
is
wellbalanced
and
easy
to
drink
if
youve
got
it
enjoy
it
now
as
its
not
a
candidate
for
aging
the
alcohol
may
soften
a
bit
and
even
the
bitterness
may
smooth
a
touch
but
its
really
spoton
where
it
should
be
and
id
doubt
that
itll
improve
much
pours
a
thick
viscous
amber
color
decent
head
retention
on
top
once
it
fades
though
theres
literally
nothing
resembling
head
or
carbonation
sweet
aroma
of
candy
sugar
caramel
and
molasses
not
as
much
of
a
hop
bite
as
many
american
interpretations
of
this
style
and
it
could
probably
use
a
bit
more
bitterness
for
balance
as
it
comes
off
as
very
sweet
thick
and
malty
this
one
is
a
true
style
sipper
of
a
brew
with
a
warming
alcohol
kick
that
you
wont
taste
as
much
as
you
will
feel
so
sweet
and
boozy
that
i
could
feel
its
sugars
and
alcohols
burning
through
me
this
isnt
always
a
bad
thing
but
i
felt
like
it
was
a
bit
much
here
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
which
certainly
is
permissible
for
the
style
the
true
style
if
you
will
i
probably
didnt
need
the
whole
22
ozs
as
a
10
oz
glass
probably
would
suffice
warming
very
not
one
id
lay
down
another
7
or
8
bucks
for
but
a
pretty
good
barleywine
nonetheless
d
the
thickness
makes
this
a
sipping
brew
the
high
alcohol
as
well
drinkable
but
slow
paced
mouthfeel
is
nice
chewy
not
watery
pretty
darned
drinkable
for
a
barley
wine
though
if
youre
not
careful
itll
knock
you
on
your
you
know
what
a
great
bargain
for
4
dollars
one
im
sure
to
partake
in
again
when
poured
the
color
was
a
reddish
brown
with
very
little
foam
and
no
lace
the
smell
of
citrus
and
hops
filled
the
nose
the
taste
was
of
a
creamy
pinecitrus
flavor
was
very
evident
with
just
a
hint
of
caramel
the
only
set
back
was
that
it
had
a
sort
of
flat
taste
one
of
the
only
beers
that
the
warmer
it
got
the
less
flavor
there
was
d
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
without
the
alcohol
heat
if
it
had
more
age
it
could
really
improve
but
now
the
alcohol
overpowers
the
other
flavors
22
ounce
bottle
bottled
in
saratoga
springs
ny
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
but
the
abv
limits
the
drinkability
drinkability
for
the
style
it
is
standard
if
not
a
touch
boring
overall
a
nice
beer
one
to
start
people
out
on
the
style
perhaps
the
abv
is
well
hidden
here
so
take
some
care
personally
i
think
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
which
is
so
much
more
available
kicks
this
beers
ass
in
the
taste
dept
i
will
definately
pick
some
more
of
this
up
d
this
beer
is
no
joke
its
alcohol
is
not
super
well
masked
to
its
slight
drinkability
detriment
and
the
effects
of
the
alcohol
are
inescapable
given
the
22
oz
serving
still
enjoying
this
beer
over
a
relaxed
two
or
three
hour
sipping
session
is
a
nobrainer
806
a
very
good
barleywine
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
as
i
havent
really
cared
for
anything
else
by
medocino
bc
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
tan
head
over
the
clear
orangey
amber
brew
head
lasts
okay
and
some
lacing
more
along
the
lines
of
usual
for
the
style
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
with
an
apparent
piney
hops
component
taste
is
upfront
with
the
hops
bitterness
to
go
along
with
that
nose
then
balances
somewhat
with
light
sweetness
and
an
alcohol
warming
close
mouthfeel
is
just
too
harsh
for
a
barleywine
for
me
hopefully
it
will
mellow
with
age
and
drinkability
is
okay
but
nothing
to
break
the
bank
for
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
to
make
this
barleywine
special
try
it
if
you
find
it
based
on
experiences
with
other
mendocino
products
i
was
prepared
to
be
underwhelmed
this
one
was
better
than
the
other
mendocino
brews
it
came
out
of
a
brown
bomber
that
keeps
with
the
mendocino
predatory
birds
theme
its
brown
with
just
a
hint
of
red
and
pours
with
very
little
head
pine
is
immediately
noticeable
in
the
smell
along
with
a
bit
of
ripe
fruit
and
a
wallop
of
alcohol
the
tase
manages
to
be
just
a
bit
better
balanced
than
the
smell
with
the
alcohol
taking
a
more
subdued
role
in
the
affair
its
less
bitter
than
most
bws
brewed
on
the
west
coast
despite
some
initial
misgivings
based
on
the
strong
alcohol
smell
it
winds
up
being
quite
drinkable
for
a
10
abv
beer
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
an
intense
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
crystal
and
roasted
malts
it
also
has
a
bitter

that
adds
balance
it
is

its
a

palate
it

the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full

beer
with

carbonation
this
is
a
solid
barley
wine
i
love
the
hoppy
flavor
it
adds
tremendous
balance
to
an
already
complex
malt
base
this
is
a
slow

good

edit
this
is
the
mad
dog
of
barleywines
2
for
a
bottle
of
supercharged
alcohol
that
will
get
you
retardedly
drunk
after
reviewing
i
fell
asleep
on
the
couch
for
6
hours
this
one
is
an
ideal
winter
warmer
barleywine
that
makes
no
effort
to
disguise
the
alcohol
content
good
flavors
lots
of
character
and
well
constructed
but
one
22
oz
bottle
will
do
nicely
for
an
evening
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
good
pleasant
barley
wine
but
not
a
world
class
one
i
would
buy
bigfoot
ale
before
i
buy
this
but
i
can
see
drinking
it
again
best
attribute
to
this
is
it
is
mild
mannered
and
pleasant
ive
seen
some
complaints
of
bad
or
skunked
bottles
of
this
beer
but
i
cant
complain
about
my
sample
it
came
from
the
bottle
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
reasonably
thick
tan
colored
head
the
nose
is
a
very
citrus
focused
hop
with
some
caramel
malt
backbone
alcohol
does
come
through
a
bit
in
the
aroma
the
taste
has
more
citrus
up
front
and
is
very
dominated
by
the
alcohol
heat
malt
caramel
and
toffee
does
show
on
the
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
slightly
slick
and
the
alcohol
content
reduces
the
drinkability
decent
but
unremarkable
beer
of
this
style
drinkability
is
what
is
because
well
its
a
barleywine
if
i
had
to
compare
this
to
anything
else
id
say
its
like
a
slightly
lesser
version
of
old
ho
not
as
hoppy
as
the
double
bastard
thankfullynot
that
i
didnt
enjoy
it
but
for
my
maltloving
tastebuds
db
was
a
bit
much
but
not
without
a
sense
of
balance
very
enjoyable
and
recommended
especially
for
those
new
to
the
style
taste
was
mostly
toffe
and
hops
with
a
little
brown
sugar
in
the
background
very
warming
brew
as
it
went
down
now
i
have
had
plenty
of
big
beers
but
for
some
reason
thisd
one
at
10
5
really
kicked
my
butt
not
sure
why
but
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
found
it
to
be
very
tasty
at
3
for
a
bomber
you
cant
go
wrong
i
am
not
sure
but
i
think
this
is
my
first
barley
wine
it
has
a
red
wines
alcohol
burn
but
with
a
beer
finish
it
poured
a
dark
amber
in
color
with
no
head
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
would
rise
every
once
in
a
while
nothing
but
the
hops
and
malts
came
out
in
the
aroma
got
tones
of
brown
sugar
and
toffee
in
the
taste
of
course
that
was
inbetween
all
of
the
alcohol
but
there
was
a
nice
hop
kick
in
the
aftertaste
that
i
really
liked
about
this
beer
gotta
be
wary
of
this
beer
the
abv
will
do
funny
things
to
you
the
beer
is
good
i
wish
the
alcohol
was
a
little
better
masked
i
would
drink
again
if
offered
the
brew
but
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
it
again
maybe
i
will
to
cellar
a
bottle
and
see
if
it
mellows
the
alcohol
any
cheers
a
solid
example
of
the
hoppier
variety
of
the
style
all
the
stocky
malt
body
youd
expect
laden
with
brown
sugar
and
toffee
hopping
was
well
balanced
more
than
ample
but
not
enough
to
go
over
the
top
finishes
quite
smooth
and
the
abv
is
well
integrated
into
the
flavor
profile
reviewed
from
a
22oz
bomber
on
122804
appears
similar
to
black
cherry
juice
with
decent
clarity
and
a
few
inches
of
tan
head
a
good
bit
of
lace
is
left
in
the
glass
and
the
head
stays
intact
well
for
the
style
malty
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
citric
hops
are
at
the
forefront
of
the
nose
a
bit
of
fruit
is
present
as
is
a
touch
of
alcohol
tastes
starts
of
a
bit
fruity
sweet
with
a
caramel
malt
and
an
underlying
hoppiness
that
adds
nicely
to
the
flavor
nicely
balanced
out
so
that
the
sweetness
doesnt
become
cloying
alcohol
is
minimal
and
it
finishes
with
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
and
a
hop
bite
sticky
and
thick
with
a
warming
feel
very
easy
drinking
it
goes
down
smooth
very
nice
example
of
the
style
that
is
pretty
damn
drinkable
flavor
starts
with
some
sweet
malt
up
front
but
the
hops
kick
in
shortly
thereafter
but
the
malt
is
the
frontrunner
here
there
are
some
very
fruity
flavors
like
plum
and
raisin
being
over
10
abv
the
alcohol
is
there
but
very
well
hidden
taste
is
rich
caramel
malty
as
all
get
out
some
nice
biting
hoppiness
in
the
background
there
but
this
is
more
of
a
britishstyle
barleywine
and
its
all
about
the
malt
molasses
and
coffee
notes
shine
through
in
the
finish
sticky
aftertaste
but
pretty
smooth
considering
at
2
29
its
certainly
worth
a
flyer
good
stuff
and
i
guess
it
will
age
nicely
too
this
is
a
good
beer
as
you
can
tell
from
my
scores
the
appearance
is
a
deep
ruby
color
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipates
quickly
there
arearomas
of
swet
rum
mincemeat
and
cognac
full
malt
profile
and
thick
hop
backbone
this
is
more
of
an
english
style
barleywine
kind
of
like
bigfoots
little
brother
or
a
nicely
aged
old
crusty
the
alcohol
levels
are
nicely
hidden
away
with
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
just
a
hint
of
etoh
at
the
end
ill
pick
up
a
coupl
eof
these
and
cellar
one
or
two
for
the
future
if
you
like
barleywine
i
reccomend
this
one
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
that
falls
to
ring
of
foam
aroma
is
big
on
caramel
malt
sweet
buttery
with
hops
more
in
the
background
pine
and
some
citrus
taste
is
full
caramel
malt
nice
sweet
little
buttery
with
some
fruit
in
the
taste
with
some
hops
in
finish
and
alcohol
mixed
with
bitterness
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
not
really
true
to
the
american
style
not
enough
hops
but
still
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
big
chewy
almost
full
drinkability
is
good
not
a
bad
beer
price
wise
fairly
cheap
even
probably
will
have
more
of
these
while
they
last
not
the
greatest
but
still
a
decent
beer
this
brew
poured
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
nice
ruby
highlights
and
a
fluffy
tan
head
aromas
are
extremely
hoppy
giving
off
a
piney
resiny
and
lightly
floral
nose
there
is
also
hints
of
caramel
bits
of
alcohol
and
a
grape
like
fruity
ester
for
flavor
this
brew
starts
off
completely
hoppy
with
notes
of
pine
cones
vinous
fresh
hops
that
were
just
picked
off
the
vine
and
an
almost
cloying
characteristic
for
the
initial
mouthfeel
following
there
is
a
rush
of
malts
giving
off
a
bits
of
caramel
and
some
dark
fruits
but
the
body
of
this
brew
seems
to
thin
out
a
bit
and
almost
have
a
watered
down
quality
at
certain
points
the
finish
to
this
brew
has
some
more
robust
hoppiness
to
it
with
warm
notes
of
alcohol
and
some
hints
of
sweetness
but
something
is
just
missing
in
the
end
the
mouthfeel
to
this
brew
was
to
me
on
and
off
at
points
as
for
drinkability
this
brew
started
off
great
but
just
went
downhill
from
there
overall
what
started
off
to
look
and
smell
like
a
really
excellent
hoppy
brew
finished
quite
lacking
in
complexity
and
left
me
wanting
to
drink
something
else
a
decent
offering
but
definetly
not
my
favorite
this
one
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
very
small
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
long
and
doesnt
leave
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
some
caramel
and
alcohol
thrown
in
there
has
a
fairly
thick
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
caramel
sweetness
as
well
as
alcohol
and
some
bitterness
on
the
finish
pretty
good
brew
ill
have
it
again
the
beer
pours
a
deep
red
color
with
hints
of
brown
in
there
with
a
ring
of
head
over
the
beer
the
nose
is
full
of
sweetness
hints
of
raisins
drizzled
in
caramel
with
some
hops
thrown
in
for
good
measure
nice
the
flavor
is
dark
fruit
upfront
followed
by
alcohol
finishing
with
a
coffee
bitterness
its
not
what
i
expect
from
a
barleywine
but
i
really
like
it
the
feel
is
very
thick
very
good
drinkability
is
okay
on
this
one
as
well
its
a
nice
and
big
beer
but
i
find
it
easy
drinking
im
impressed
i
would
try
this
one
if
i
found
it
again
pretty
good
barleywine
a
bit
more
bitterness
would
help
but
otherwise
good
for
a
cold
december
night
the
price
is
nice
too
i
think
this
bomber
cost
me
3
not
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
in
my
not
so
humble
opinion
ive
had
better
ive
made
better
and
ill
buy
better
sure
its
cheap
2
29
per
bomber
but
theres
no
reason
to
unless
you
are
a
masochist
the
alcohol
is
pretty
big
in
the
aroma
theres
barleywine
butter
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
along
with
the
standard
old
fruit
its
pretty
sweet
its
got
a
bitter
finish
im
not
sure
why
i
dont
like
this
one
it
has
all
the
components
for
a
good
solid
barleywine
but
they
dont
seem
to
mesh
well
not
bad
but
a
little
offputting
at
times
pours
a
nice
medium
amber
with
a
soft
billowy
light
tan
head
a
very
nice
hopdriven
nose
very
spicy
alcohol
sweetness
hidden
deep
in
the
back
quite
inviting
the
palate
is
more
malty
than
hoppy
unlike
the
nose
rich
slightly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
back
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
coating
and
somewhat
thick
up
front
but
drying
and
slightly
bitter
on
the
finish
a
very
good
barleywine
even
if
on
the
hoppy
side
good
balance
with
a
west
coast
hop
profile
hope
to
try
this
one
again
a
decent
barleywine
reddish
amber
in
appearance
with
a
decent
head
smell
is
a
little
heavy
on
the
alcohol
but
has
enough
malt
aroma
to
invite
you
to
drink
taste
is
likewise
a
little
over
the
top
on
the
alcohol
but
the
sweet
malt
rescues
it
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
dry
medium
and
a
bit
syrupy
easy
enough
on
the
drinkability
scale
for
10
5
abv
overall
a
decent
brew
initial
underlying
grapefruit
rind
bitterness
joins
with
an
apple
and
pear
caramel
and
toffee
bittersweet
maltiness
the
alcohol
is
there
not
overpowering
but
definitely
making
its
whiskeyish
presence
known
more
as
it
warms
malt
hop
balance
carries
through
to
the
end
hints
of
smokiness
in
the
background
very
warming
appropriately
chewy
mouthfeel
there
are
other
brews
of
this
strength
i
could
drink
more
of
as
the
alcohol
isnt
as
up
front
as
it
is
in
this
one
still
a
nice
effort
and
one
of
the
better
brews
ive
had
out
of
mendocino
not
necessarily
english
in
style
but
this
is
definately
malt
accented
a
nice
blend
of
caramel
butter
and
toffee
notes
along
with
notes
of
earth
bark
grapefruit
and
red
apple
skins
quite
tasty
beer
is
good
happy
beering
the
flavor
screams
of
soft
fruity
malt
and
a
sour
barley
flavor
it
has
the
light
body
of
a
juice
the
flavor
lacks
some
complexity
it
is
overpowering
in
its
tartness
and
sweetness
but
its
not
bad
some
molasses
flavors
come
through
that
make
it
a
bit
too
sweet
overall
it
is
a
good
barley
wine
but
not
a
daily
drinker
the
beer
evacuates
the
22
ounce
brown
bottle
a
transpicuous
burnished
copper
color
with
a
planetary
sized
head
the
is
frothy
in
texture
and
the
color
a
toothsome
light
tan
color
the
resultant
lace
a
thick
blanket
to
cover
the
glass
nose
is
rich
in
malt
hints
of
caramel
molasses
maybe
plum
like
earthy
and
hearty
to
the
senses
this
beer
start
is
sweet
and
rich
in
malt
the
top
moderate
to
full
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
respectably
acidic
the
hops
hail
and
hearty
in
their
spiciness
and
the
beer
quite
dry
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
bitterness
a
for
sure
belly
warmer
this
one
and
one
not
made
for
the
palate
challenged
drinkers
drinkability
is
very
nice
i
shared
with
a
nonba
and
his
only
comment
was
wow
its
powerful
and
very
tasty
another
convert
this
is
definitely
a
good
one
for
sipping
this
brew
should
be
enjoyed
for
what
it
is
not
for
what
it
should
be
it
is
full
bodied
complex
and
smooth
it
is
endowed
with
a
profuse
and
luxurious
smell
and
a
relaxed
mouthfeel
that
sits
like
a
heavy
blanket
on
a
winters
morn
this
is
a
premium
barleywine

a
slow
sipping
work
of
considerable
craftsmanship
i
was
really
surprised
to
see
a
new
barley
wine
on
the
market
and
even
more
surprised
to
see
that
it
was
from
mendocino
the
beer
poured
with
a
nice
head
and
a
potent
hop
nose
the
color
was
dark
amber
and
looked
great
the
taste
was
that
of
a
nice
rich
hoppy
barley
wine

may
be
a
bit
too
sweet
for
some
the
taste
is
long
and
lingering
with
definite
alcohol
warmth
as
it
warms
the
flavors
come
together
much
better
there
is
no
vintage
dating
but
some
time
may
help
round
out
the
syrupy
sweetness
a
good
attempt
and
i
hope
they
start
brewing
bigger
beers
berkeley
bowl
has
an
interesting
progression
of
flavors
and
very
balanced
me
thinks
this
one
needs
to
age
for
a
while
seems
a
little
young
and
harsh
bottom
line
is
that
this
beer
stands
alone
by
itself
in
the
lagunitas
lineup
definitely
worth
a
shot
at
5
for
a
bomber
poured
a
clear
copper
body
with
one
finger
head
and
left
a
lace
ring
around
glass
aroma
is
a
little
boozy
with
touches
of
dark
fruits
figs
prunes
hoppy
beer
smooth
medium
strength
body
little
bit
of
heat
on
the
finish
a
little
sticky
from
the
malts
mostly
some
toffee
or
caramel
sweetness
and
these
balance
with
citric
hoppy
earthy
flavors
and
touches
of
dark
fruits
pretty
well
built
and
strong
holds
up
and
i
like
the
extra
hop
notes
wow
i
wouldnt
really
think
this
is
a
barleywine
its
way
more
of
a
hybrid
for
me
reminds
me
of
their
wtf
which
they
stopped
making
for
some
stupid
reason
hoppy
but
not
overly
so
great
balance
not
really
a
good
representation
of
a
barleywine
so
if
thats
what
you
are
looking
for
choose
something
else
o
of
the
sweeter
lagunitas
offerings
undercover
investigation
brown
shugga
hairy
eyeball
this
is
my
favorite
the
sweetness
actually
accentuates
the
hop
flavors
and
bitterness
rather
than
muddling
it
resulting
in
a
high
drinkability
factor
rubycopper
pour
with
dense
offwhite
foam
slightly
sweet
metallic
aroma
of
alcohol
and
caramel
candy
sweet
nutty
alcoholic
flavor
finishes
nicely
with
subtle
grapefruit
smooth
and
scrumptious
very
similar
to
brown
shugga
has
a
nice
crisp
pine
hop
aroma
followed
by
a
semisweet
malt
burnt
sugar
taste
the
leads
into
a
medium
dry
grapefruit
finish
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
but
it
really
isnt
much
of
a
barleywine
american
or
english
fairly
sweet
with
a
strong
caramel
malt
base
and
dark
sugars
tastes
very
similar
to
brown
shugga
no
no
no
no
no
flavorful
nice
for
kicking
back
and
relaxing
2015
citrus
piney
nose
almost
like
nugget
nectar
sweet
though
nicely
balanced
with
the
hops
alcohol
at
the
end
needs
a
few
more
months
to
mellow
out
a
bit
lagunitas
never
disappoints
in
terms
of
value
will
pick
up
a
couple
more
break
them
out
around
christmas
overall
a
nice
hoppy
american
barleywine
that
i
would
definitely
have
again
id
like
to
see
what
a
year
of
age
does
to
this
so
ill
buy
another
twentyfifteen
bottle
especially
at
this
price
point
very
reasonable
it
was
doggone
good
overall
solid
barleywine
wish
the
hops
were
as
prominent
in
the
taste
as
they
are
in
the
aroma
but
nonetheless
this
is
enjoyable
and
certainly
worth
a
try
loves
me
a
barleywine
and
lagunitas
but
i
wasnt
vibin
with
this
at
all
great
value
for
what
you
get
out
of
it
good
beer
but
has
a
bitter
finish
and
metallic
nose
fabulous
barleywine
the
sweeter
end
of
a
malt
presence
compared
to
a
double
ipa
the
initial
taste
is
the
sweetness
with
the
hop
complexity
following
soon
after
at
56
for
a
22
oz
bomber
this
is
a
good
value
ive
had
this
fresh
and
aged
as
i
somehow
acquired
a
bunch
of
2011
gnarlywines
at
a
nice
discount
fresh
i
get
a
rich
malty
toasted
coconut
caramel
malt
flavor
contrasting
with
a
ton
of
sticky
citrusy
hops
theres
a
smoothly
sweet
finish
the
age
mellows
out
some
of
the
rough
edges
nice
barely
wine
with
lots
of
character
lagunitas
sweetness
comes
through
for
a
great
mouthful
and
finish
would
drink
again
and
again
and
again
i
like
my
barleywines
on
the
sweet
side
and
thought
this
would
be
hoppy
it
was
not
mildly
sweet
well
balanced
tremendous
value
for
the
price
excellent
barley
wine
at
a
great
price
let
it
rest
for
a
while
delicious

lagunitas
bombers
this
one
is
arguably
underpriced
a
big
sipper
that
shines
as
it
warms
isnt
overly
complex
and
gets
the
job
done
nice
example
of
an
american
barleywine
especially
at
the
pricepoint
o
solid
american
barley
wine
for
a
good
bomber
price
ill
buy
this
again
if
i
see
it
2015
version
many
layers
here
from
start
to
finish
the
ride
from
hoppy
and
rich
to
robust
and
phenol
was
delightful
with
warming
very
great
example
for
the
price
point
especially
in
ohio
one
of
the
big
players
in
american
barlewywines
pours
a
deep
and
clear
ruby
brown
with
a
thicker
tan
head
the
head
dissipates
fairly
quickly
but
leaves
some
nice
small
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
deep
roasted
sugar
and
some
nice
pine
hops
the
taste
follows
closely
in
line
and
is
equally
as
pleasant
as
the
aroma
the
body
has
a
nice
weight
to
it
not
quite
as
thick
as
others
ive
had
but
in
no
way
watery
or
even
thin
feeling
and
its
nice
and
smooth
throughout
yet
its
full
and
maltydry
body
struggle
deeper
and
deeper
in
finish
the
sweetness
is
able
to
scrub
out
the
tinny
briny
and
piquant
character
of
hops
with
extensions
of
citrus
peel
and
crushed
pinecone
the
beer
lingers
on
and
on
begging
for
a
pairing
of
the
sharpest
blue
cheese
possible
one
of
the
easiest
barleywines
to
get
down
packs
big
flavor
and
a
smooth
aggressive
feel
but
relatively
restrained
as
it
never
destroys
the
palate
great
balance
overall
lagunitas
has
absolutely
perfected
the
art
of
producing
simple
and
straightforward
yet
extremely
tasty
beers
and
this
is
another
example
of
that
its
not
going
to
blow
your
mind
but
its
a
very
tasty
barleywine
and
for
under
5
this
is
yet
another
lagunitas
offering
that
would
be
perfect
for
that
goto
seasonal
cheers
my
favorite
barley
wine
to
date
2015
is
good
2011
is
the
shiz
the
taste
leans
more
on
the
barley
malts
but
the
unexpected
dark
fruit
flavor
really
comes
into
the
fold
it
adds
a
fascinating
balance
that
takes
away
from
the
usual
acerbic
barley
malt
character
that
defines
the
style
beautiful
mahogany
color
but
not
a
powerful
scent
very
hoppy
for
a
barleywine
but
not
overdone
like
some
theres
a
tad
bit
of
sweetness
that
balances
out
the
bitter
hops
hard
to
pin
down
the
taste
brown
sugar
and
caramel
i
guess
mouthfeel
is
not
as
dense
as
some
barleywines
which
makes
it
an
easier
drinker
i
hadnt
had
this
for
years
it
was
one
of
my
first
in
the
style
and
im
really
glad
to
find
it
again
not
out
of
this
world
but
a
great
beer
at
4
99
a
bomber
best
six
dollars
ive
spent
in
a
long
time
cant
beat
good
tasting
beer
with
a
high
abv
at
a
reasonable
price
gotta
love
lagunitas
pretty
typical
american
barleywine
kind
of
a
hybrid
between
a
barleywine
and
a
dipa
but
still
solid
overall
and
at
a
great
pricepoint
good
tasting
barley
wine
wonder
how
it
is
aged
o
this
was
the
first
beer
i
ever
had
from
lagunitas
and
im
glad
to
have
had
it
again
a
very
good
barleywine
that
is
not
too
hoppy
like
i
find
many
american
versions
to
be
and
you
get
the
bonus
of
the
great
price
you
get
with
lagunitas
as
well
o
another
solid
brew
from
lagunitas
are
these
guys
mad
scientists
or
what
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
barley
wines
but
this
is
damn
good
very
complex
beer
entirely
drinkable
now
and
im
anxious
to
see
what
happens
with
age
its
great
to
see
this
one
back
on
shelves
its
a
hoppy
barleywine
that
borderlines
being
a
dipa
but
what
else
would
you
expect
from
lagunitas
they
still
stay
true
to
style
recommended
very
sweet
for
a
barley
wine
couldnt
tell
almost
11

of
how

cracked

intense
flavors
that
make
for
a
delicious
dessert
but
glad
i
had
someone
to
share
the
bomber
with
as
the
sweetness
could
become
a
bit
too
much
after
12
ounces
rich
robust
intense
and
very
dense
deep
full
flavor
and
a
very
long
finish
at
novare
res
was
given
a
glass
the
color
is
classic
barley
wine
buy
the
glass
and
how
it
was
served
free
definitely
knock
it
up
the
aroma
is
sweet
caremel
toffee
butter
delicious
the
taste
matches
swwleet
up

bit
the
carel
and
slight
and
i
men
slickeryfht
roast
come
in
to
smooth
the
tongue
the
finish
is
slightly
ddru
but
beautiful
the
eas
a
2011
and
is
drinking
perfect
stupid
phone
overall
this
is
a
good
barleywine
and
i
think
age
is
doing
it
well
seems
like
it
could
easily
go
much
langer
before
it
starts
going
downhill
anyways
this
is
certainly
one
worth
trying
poured
deep
maple
with
a
touch
of
clementine
in
the
borders
brilliantly
clear
but
nary
a
head
to
speak
of
and
looked
pretty
dead
from
atop
no
bubbles
the
smell
however
is
a
different
animal
and
yes
this
is
definitely
a
different
animal
big
malts
lots
of
caramel
less
toffee
more
biscuit
barely
any
bitterness
detected
although
there
is
a
hint
of
citrus
maybe
a
grapefruit
zest
thrown
in
but
there
is
definitely
some
butter
here
not
butterscotch
mind
you
but
butter
im
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
that
but
sure
why
not
maybe
a
touch
of
golden
raisins
mixed
in
with
the
butter
rum
and
caramel
very
sweet
in
that
respect
but
its
kept
in
check
somehow
by
an
invisible
and
undetectable
hop
cone
somewhere
the
body
feels
sticky
but
medium
in
quality
and
lo
there
is
carbonation
despite
not
showing
up
at
first
glance
effervescent
is
too
strong
of
a
word
here
so
ill
say
it
is
decently
carbed
overall
not
bad
not
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
overall
a
really
respectable
barley
wine
pretty
well
executed
would
recommend
it
lots
of
flavour
and
quite
a
nice
sippable
highstrength
ale
o
a
very
tasty
american
barleywine
that
aged
beautifully
after
a
year
in
the
cellar
the
near11
abv
mellows
quite
nicely
leaving
the
complex
fruity
flavors
in
tact
while
not
compromising
the
bitter
hop
resins
within
the
booziness
seems
more
restrained
as
well
allowing
more
subtle
malt
flavors
to
shine
though
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
to
open
in
a
year
or
two
22

about
an

is
good

theres
also

aroma
is
nice
the
brew
smells
like
caramel
toffee
brown
sugar
dark
fruit
and
a
bit
of
sweet
booze
i
think
the
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
breadygrainy
malt
noticeable
its
very
sweet
and
malty

is

its
very
smooth
and
has
moderate

i
think
its
a
good
brew
and
at
just
4

a

its
definitely
worth
trying

that

had
drank
this
in
the
past
2010
vintage
at
meadhall
in
cambridge
for
12
brewers
of
christmas
delicious
beer
to
which
the
age
has
contributed
nicely
everything
is
exquisite
huge
sweet

qualities
and
heavy

awesome
stuff
lagunitas
is
correct
olde
gnarlywine
ale
is
dog
gone
good
it
is
hard
to
beat
lagunitas
good
quality
and
good
value
very
maltforward
with
zero
hops
and
still
sweetish
after
12
years
the
oxidation
is
fairly
minimal
otherwise
and
the
beer
has
held
up
pretty
well
very
sweet
and
spicy
just
a
little
hot
an
awesome
bitter
bite
the
hops
are
all
there
aftertaste
is
sweet
golden
sticky
as
heck
as
it
warms
a
ruby
syruppiness
starts
to
really
glow
the
alcohol
comes
through
the
nostrils
after
each
swallow
certainly
a

tulip
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
amber
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
intense
hops
on
opening
the
bottle
with
a
great
aroma
of
herbal
and
piney
hops
and
caramel
malt
hops
dominate
the
beginning
of
the
taste
then
sweet
malt
and
fruits
develop
finish
is

somewhat
boozy
light

finish
creamy
medium
bodied
interesting
and
fun
to
drink
one
of
my
favorite
barley
wines
pours
a
nice
translucent
deep
amber
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
settles
but
never
disappears
smell
and
taste
are
huge
and
diverse
lots
of
the
sticky
sweets
and
very
prevalent
booze
this
one
is
a
really
slow
sipper
based
on
that
alone
but
the
sticky
chewy
mouthfeel
slows
you
down
even
more
not
inappropriate
for
the
style
but
also
not
perfect
for
me
i
was
worn
out
before
finish
my
12oz
pour
but
i
loved
the
first
half
of
it
definitely
worth
a
shot
overall
really
nice
brew
and
one
id
imagine
would
age
very
well
overall
pretty
much
what
i
expected
from
lagunitas
a
solid
interpretation
of
the
american
barleywine
overall
i
enjoyed
this
but
it
is
definitely
not
a
heavy
hitter
it
is
though
a
great
barleywine
at
a
great
price
a
must
if
you
come
across
it
o
a
bit
of
astringency
in
the
taste
but
besides
that
this
is
a
sweet
bold
warming
tasty
barleywine
this
beer
pours
out
a
muddy
brown
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
dark
fruits
and
malts
yet
still
maintains
a
bit
of
a
hop
presence
on
the
tongue
the
caramel
malts
and
dark
fruits
are
the
main
attraction
theres
a
bit
of
bitterness
that
keeps
everything
in
check
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
fairly
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
farther
good
for
the
abv
overall
this
is
a
rather
good
and
inexpensive
american
barleywine
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
13

and
a
hint
of

the
style

american

clean

overall
good
appearance
great
aroma
blend
and
body
at
the
end
of
the
day
somehow
old
gnarlywine
is
a
beer
where
the
whole
is
much
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
the
taste
was
good
the
consistency
and
smell
were
a
little
better
than
ok
but
when
it
was
gone
hey
i
missed
it
and
wish
it
was
more
there
is
something
intangibly
great
about
this
beer
a
little
uh
sumpin
sumpin
rimshot
going
on
i
will
buy
this
again
for
shizzle
i
really
enjoyed
this
but
would
like
to
see
how
it
tastes
with
some
age
on
it
after
34
of
a
glass
this
was
getting
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
its
still
a
great
barleywine
overall
overlysweet
at
first
but
enjoyable
as
the
beer
mellows
out
in
the
glass
a
good
desert
barleywine
overall
feel
a
little
weird
making
my
first
review
of
this
beer
from
a
9
year
old
bottle
been
looking
at
it
for
a
few
years
now
and
glad
to
finally
crawl
inside
cellared
like
a
champ
recommend
putting
bottles
back
for
as
long
as
you
can
stand
it
d
drinks
more
like
an
american
strong
w
a
sizable
malt
body
here
however
certainly
a
reasonable
amount
of
bitterness
keeps
things
balanced
ranking
3
of
the
4
tried
ease
into
this
one
as
a
sipper
with
a
hearty
dinner
o
lagunitas
does
it
again
i
have
yet
to
have
something
from
them
that
disappoints
o
great
aroma
mouthfeel
and
taste
alcohol
comes
thru
nicely
and
adds
a
warmth
which
is
great
in
the
winter
but
limits
the
amount
you
can
drink
first
time
having
this
one
i
grabbed
a
bottle
at
capones
while
i
was
on
a
barleywine
binge
grabbing
this
along
side
insanity
our
finest
regards
and
a
couple
others
pours
a
reddishamber
hue
with
roughly
a
fingers
worth
of
quickly
dissipating
head
leaves
but
the
thinnest
and
sparsest
lacing
behind
the
nose
gives
hints
of
vanilla
caramel
and
some
raisins
it
is
a
very
very
boozy
scent
indeed
the
taste
follows
closely
behind
the
nose
lots
of
prominent
roasted
caramel
flavors
vanilla
malt
booze
god
forbid
this
stuff
makes
you
burp
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
but
hot
the
tail
end
of
each
sip
departs
with
a
tad
of
bitterness
overall
a
solid
brew
perhaps
id
have
rated
it
a
bit
higher
but
having
had
the
likes
of
abacus
ba
naked
evil
and
some
others
recently
this
one
doesnt
quite
stack
up
as
well
an
interesting
sweetness
for
the
style
reminds
me
more
of
a
holiday
spiced
ale
still
a
great
damn
beer
overall
a
decent
beer
but
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
o
i
was
looking
for
a
bit
more
complexity
but
its
a
tasty
beer
a
good
barleywine
balanced
and
full
of
flavour
with
enough
hop
character
to
balance
the
toffee
like
malts
and
make
this
drinkable
olde
gnarlywine
pours
into
the
glass
a
deep
dark
mahagony
red
plum
looking
color
looking
like
many
other
lagunitas
darker
offerings
a
nice
beige
head
up
top
with
life
and
able
to
stick
to
the
glass
smell
is
very
malty
at
this
point
in
the
game
no
hops
in
the
nose
to
speak
of
sweet
candi
with
sugars
in
the
nose
with
some
deep
caramel
and
toffee
some
english
malt
is
noted
along
with
a
faint
hit
of
alcohol
taste
is
pretty
good
looking
for
any
hops
i
was
unable
to
find
any
they
faded
in
the
3
years
no
hops
brings
out
the
malt
ansd
yeast
and
shows
off
its
english
ingredients
candi
light
chocolate
and
grain
from
all
dat
der
barley
sadly
alcohol
comes
into
play
and
i
can
taste
it
which
detracts
a
bit
feel
is
above
medium
and
is
a
bit
sryupy
carb
is
light
off
this
tap
but
the
ride
is
pretty
smooth
except
for
the
burn
all
in
all
a
nice
bwine
to
go
to
on
the
cheap
i
need
to
find
a
fresh
bottle
and
see
what
the
hop
bill
is
on
this
one
id
imagine
pretty
high
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
that
doesnt
quite
make
it
to
the
top
tier
but
i
have
to
give
lagunitas
major
credit
for
making
it
affordable
absolutely
delicious
everything
here
is
working
on
all
cylinders
the
malt
is
great
the
alcohol
is
present
but
subdued
fantastic
i
decided
to
go
ahead
and
try
this
beer
after
seeing
it
at
a
bottle
shop
today
and
for
only
3
99
boy
am
i
surprised
dont
tell
lagunitas
but
id
buy
this
beer
for
almost
twice
the
price
good
though
not
quite
the
best
of
the
style
in
typical
lagunitas
fashion
there
is
tons
of
flavor
packed
into
this
beer
for
a
very
reasonable
price
will
definitely
buy
another
to
age
a
year
or
two
may
smooth
out
the
graininess
a
bit
and
make
this
one
even
better
2011

aught
11
release
5
39
for
the
22
oz
bottle
overall
a
nice
barleywine
a
little
more
carbonation
and
hop
balance
would
have
made
this
a
great
beer
pours
a
dark
orange
with
a
small
eggshell
head
that
quickly
fades
lots
of
malt
upfront
with
a
warming
sugary
smell
tastes
of
brown
sugar
with
some
honey
touches
and
a
fig
apercot
presence
way
sweeter
than
a
usual
barleywine
mouthfeel
is
pretty
much
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
the
style
pretty
drinkable
no
sence
of
the
11
abv
what
so
ever
i
guess
thats
due
to
2
years
in
the
cellar
overall
pretty
good
not
mind
blowing
but
for
5
bucks
its
a
great
value
o
very
good
beer
from
lagunitas
that
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
again
in
the
future
probably
sooner
than
later
o
a
awesome
brew
for
the
price
and
availability
try
it
if
youre
able
to
find
it
o
this
is
a
world
class
barleywine
and
for
3
994
99
a
bomber
i
dont
know
why
i
waste
my
time
with
other
overpriced
barleywines
o
pretty
good
not
my
favorite
barley
wine
tentative
recommendation
but
probably
wont
pick
up
another
one
o
not
my
favourite
barleywine
but
a
nice
beer
lagunitas
has
yet
to
make
something
i
have
not
enjoyed
recommended
if
you
like
this
style
more
sweet
than
hoppy
probably
wont
have
again
o
d
nothing
special
its
fine
i
dont
know
that
its
my
favorite
but
it
seems
fine
to
me
2010
bottle
pours
a
reddish
orange
with
a
small
but
well
retained
head
and
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
all
sorts
of
awesome
lots
or
orange
marmalade
and
sweet
floral
notes
there
is
a
cordial
or
liqueur
note
that
maybe
i
cant
place
my
finger
on
so
well
maybe
cherry
maybe
sloe
gin
either
way
i
like
it
there
are
fairly
strong
boozy
tones
present
but
not
in
an
annoying
way
earthy
and
toasty
notes
add
to
the
background
of
the
bouquet
the
flavor
is
nice
with
plenty
of
sweet
molasses
and
cordial
there
are
some
earthy
hops
that
are
really
nice
and
at
about
one
year
are
still
very
strongly
present
mid
glass
this
starts
slipping
away
from
me
when
a
sort
of
odd
boozy
on
bitter
fight
occurs
but
then
i
got
the
ground
aspirin
note
once
thats
been
introduced
to
the
palate
try
as
you
may
to
erase
it
from
your
mind
it
will
come
within
inches
of
ruining
an
otherwise
very
nice
beer
every
time
i
loved
the
way
this
smelled
and
i
liked
the
way
it
tasted
too
had
i
not
picked
up
that
aspirin
note
i
think
i
would
have
scored
it
a
lot
higher
for
the
price
i
know
ill
be
able
to
give
it
another
shot
someday
this
is
an
intense
beer
dry
up
front
with
lots
of
grain
barley
and
bread
notes
a
taste
of
grass
holds
it
on
edge
then
some
sweeter
notes
and
a
little
balance
slight
caramel
burnt
sugar
a
very
good
beer
a
sipper
for
sure
a
great
buy
and
im
aging
a
couple
right
now
so
i
have
solid
hopes
for
those
overall
a
fantastic
barleywine
style
ale
lagunitas
does
it
again
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
how
gloriously
it
looked
beaming
in
the
glass
despite
the
lack
of
any
head
i
guess
it
would
be
hard
to
expect
an
active
creamy
head
with
such
a
thick
brew
but
the
color
alone
was
pretty
spectacular
on
other
notes
the
beer
was
a
bit
sweet
but
ultimately
appropriately
so
while
the
aromas
continually
made
up
for
this
making
this
beer
ever
the
more
inviting
bomber
pored
into
a
glass
pours
dark
amber
with
a
good
amount
of
foam
that
sticks
around
for
a
couple
of
minutes
smells
of
citrus
tasted
is
sweet
malt
with
a
good
balance
of
hop
notes
purchased
for
4
99
a
pretty
good
value
for
a
style
that
i
have
only
had
a
handful
of
times
tasted
in
august
2010
on
draft
at
the
twisted
spoke
pour
is
clear
orange
amber
with
a
thick
white
head
that
never
truly
goes
away
nose
is
sweet
caramel
with
bitter
orange
peel
even
more
bitter
hops
and
a
hint
of
honey
flavor
starts
off
with
brown
sugar
and
honey
sweetness
and
moves
to
bitter
orange
peel
and
hops
the
body
is
big
and
thick
with
average
carbonation
and
a
long
bitter
hops
and
brown
sugar
finish
this
is
very
hoppy
for
a
barley
wine
but
still
nicely
balanced
the
alcohol
is
hardly
noticed
until
the
bit
of
burn
in
my
chest
o
overall
a
good
barleywine
i
think
its
more
similar
to
an
english
barleywine
than
an
american
but
it
was
better
than
i
expected
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
3
inch
light
orange
head
that
fades
to
a
small
foamy
cap
nice
distinct
thin
rings
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
citrus
zest
and
pine
and
caramel
malt
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
balanced
by
citrus
zestpine
hops
there
is
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
that
comes
out
too
mild
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
makes
for
a
slightly
thick
and
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
barleywine
that
tastes
better
than
it
smells
another
good
value
for
the
price
i
paid
3
99
for
a
bomber
from
lagunitas
pours
a
dark
dank
heavy
copper
color
with
a
fat
2
finger
head
smell
is
out
of
this
world
fruity
spicy
piney
earthy
sugary
resiney
smells
like
all
my
favorite
beers
in
one
the
sugary
and
fruity
kick
is
probably
most
dominant
taste
is
a
bit
more
subdued
but
still
good
dirty
and
earthy
hoppiness
with
a
twist
of
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
nice
lingering
bitterness
all
around
nice
caramel
backbone
holds
it
together
nicely
i
feel
it
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
personally
just
a
tad
too
bit
flat
and
oily
for
me
but
otherwise
a
great
beer
especially
at
5
per
bomber
this
is
definitely
on
the
sweeter
less
hoppy
side
of
the
barleywines
ive
had
its
shockingly
fruity
in
both
the
smell
and
the
taste
i
like
it
but
i
think
it
could
have
better
balance
the
malts
and
the
hops
dont
come
together
as
id
like
them
to
still
very
worth
drinking
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
a
little
below
average
overall
it
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
the
big
malty
flavors
were
really
complimented
nicely
by
the
juicy
hops
very
flavorful
and
relatively
easy
drinking
beer
and
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
this
evening
o
very
good
beer
id
love
to
have
this
again
with
some
age
on
it
the
drinkability
is
scary
good
for
a
beer
of
10
6
abv
another
winner
from
lagunitas
overall
this
beer
was
great
it
was
very
complex
and
delicious
to
be
honest
this
may
have
been
the
best
beer
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
in
its
price
range
which
was
about
5
for
the
bomber
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
omore
like
an
english
barleywine
not
enough
hop
presence
to
call
this
one
an
american
it
was
good
but
not
great
o
o
another
great
beer
by
lagunitas
overall
this
was
a
surprise
to
me
very
enjoyable
good
price
as
well
a
solid
bwine
definitely
worth
a
try
drink
it
was
pretty
good
a
bit
too
sweet
for
the
taste
for
me
looked
and
smell
good
as
well
probably
wont
come
back
to
this
one
syrupy
sweet
both
of
them
i
am
amazed
that
the
flavor
profiles
of
these
beers
are
so
similar
caramel
toffee
and
full
bodied
i
like
the
2year
old
version
a
little
better
but
i
guess
i
am
just
not
really
a
fan
of
this
one
in
general
i
am
shocked
by
the
rating
of
this
beer
here
its
like
a
harsher
less
integrated
brown
shugga
i
noticed
that
the
2004
label
i
have
is
9
7
i
wonder
why
they
unnecessarily
raised
the
abv
on
this
i
remember
liking
it
a
little
more
back
in
the
day
overall
good
price
on
this
and
its
a
nice
filling
beverage
for
those
chilly
nites
o
this
ones
smell
and
taste
bring
me
back
to
my
childhood
with
ring
pops
airheads
icees
and
all
the
candies
you
could
find
in
a
corner
store
but
brought
to
the
snobbish
beer
advocate
level
between
back
burner
stones
old
guardian
and
this
one
i
cant
decide
which
is
my
favorite
the
mouthfeel
is
poor
but
permissibly
so
given
the
high
abv
its
pretty
flat
though
not
entirely
still
did
the
yeast
give
out
on
this
particular
batch
that
would
explain
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
the
lack
of
developed
flavors
overall
this
is
not
a
good
barleywine
its
like
a
far
less
hoppy
way
less
interesting
version
of
most
other
american
barleywines
hopefully
its
just
this
keg
thats
problematic
it
isnt
like
lagunitas
to
miss
this
badly
on
a
beer
drinkable
but
awkward
and
mostly
unejoyable
weird
this
beer
brought
back
memories
of
my
childhood
its
been
said
that
smell
is
the
sense
that
is
the
most
lasting
well
after
getting
a
whiff
of
this
beauty
i
couldnt
agree
more
poured
a
fantastic
deep
red
with
a
reddish
tinged
thin
head
really
a
nice
looking
beer
but
the
smell
is
what
did
it
for
me
it
took
me
a
good
long
while
to
figure
it
out
and
its
those
butterscotch
candies
i
ate
as
a
kid
in
my
grandparents
house
in
ne
philly
this
beer
is
like
my
blankie
as
others
have
mentioned
its
a
sipper
sweet
and
gooey
with
a
nice
warm
alcohol
bite
figs
dates
and
maybe
a
little
vanilla
kick
back
and
enjoy
o
this
barleywine
is
a
slow
sipper
kick
back
in
an
easy
chair
with
a
good
book
and
take
an
hour
two
on
this
one
o
might
have
to
get
another
or
two
and
cellar
to
see
how
this
develops
still
quite
sweet
and
maybe
needs
to
settle
down
a
bit
and
let
it
develop
a
little
more
not
bad
but
a
sipper
due
to
the
sweetness
poured
a
very
hazy
dark
burnt
ruby
amber
very
intresting
hue
as
the
reddish
tint
was
very
noticeable
even
though
the
haze
made
it
almost
opaque
a
one
inch
head
formed
on
the
top
upon
pour
that
faded
almost
immediatly
what
was
left
was
a
thin
film
of
decent
quality
lace
that
circle
around
the
glass
smell
was
very
sweet
caramel
sugars
hitting
almost
immediatly
the
deeper
smell
after
some
warming
indicated
a
nice
bready
earthy
malt
back
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
which
at
9abv
and
being
a
barleywine
should
be
expected
the
taste
for
me
was
just
too
light
i
expect
barleywines
to
make
me
sit
down
and
to
be
a
definite
sipper
but
this
just
did
not
have
the
fullness
i
would
have
expected
the
finish
on
it
was
very
dry
and
did
last
a
good
bit
though
the
taste
itself
was
very
hoppy
with
piney
flavors
the
most
noticeable
a
slight
malt
back
was
trying
to
form
with
flavors
of
grain
and
bread
but
was
just
too
thin
to
really
be
noticed
there
was
a
huge
amount
of
carbonation
again
for
a
barleywine
on
this
one
lots
of
fizz
and
contributed
to
the
feeling
of
lightness
overall
this
gave
me
more
of
an
impression
of
a
well
balanced
double
ipa
may
improve
and
bring
out
some
flavors
as
it
sits
but
a
little
younf
still
for
me
poured
from
a
bottle
into
an
oversized
snifter
the
beer
is
a
deep
crystal
copper
coloring
that
is
very
dark
in
the
deeper
parts
the
head
settles
into
an
offwhite
foamy
light
head
that
is
ambertinted
and
rests
into
about
a
half
an
inch
nose
is
tangysweet
with
a
sugarysweet
caramel
base
that
has
a
slightly
sour
tone
to
it
the
beer
is
viscous
and
oily
slick
in
mouth
with
flavors
of
tangy
sweet
and
slightly
sour
dark
fruit
flavors
it
almost
tastes
like
a
little
raisin
and
a
little
prune
juice
with
a
healthy
dose
of
pineapple
not
much
on
the
spice
to
help
balance
it
although
there
is
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
in
there
at
the
end
sometimes
almost
overpowering
with
some
slight
boozy
characteristics
the
beer
has
the
tangy
sour
flavors
into
the
aftertaste
and
they
slowly
fade
in
mouth
with
a
long
lingering
finish
this
one
is
interesting
but
definitely
an
acquired
taste
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
how
it
ages
if
anyone
was
so
inclined
o
the
easiest
thing
to
do
here
is
compare
this
with
bigfoot
i
think
i
dig
bigfoot
due
to
the
hops
and
bitterness
which
is
quite
high
however
this
beer
is
so
well
balanced
that
i
could
fall
for
this
as
well
very
nice
barleywine
by
an
outstanding
brewery
hats
off
notes
after
having
had
the
cask
and
draft
version
of
lagunitas
gnarlywine
i
was
looking
forward
to
catch
a
bottle
with
mixed
expectations
this
sits
somewhere
in
between
it
lacks
the
very
rich
and
complex
malt
and
hop
profile
of
the
cask
but
offers
a
much
longer
and
pronounced
range
than
the
version
i
had
on
tap
tap
may
have
suffered
from
being
a
bit
too
cold
but
found
it
a
bit
blah
however
this
bottle
is
one
of
the
best
fresh
barleywines
i
have
had
this
season
with
good
memories
of
the
cask
experience
in
the
horizon
ill
gladly
age
a
couple
of
these
bottles
to
see
how
they
turn
around
and
again
the
pricequality
ratio
is
tremendous
o
of

varieties
ive
tried

very
well

the
olde

produces
the
best
bang
for
your
buck
i
recommend
this
lagunitas
bomber
to
anyone
who
wants
a
sweetened
craft
beer
that
packs
a
great
berry
taste
even
at
a
high
abv
i
bought
this
22oz
bomber
for
under
5
a
great
oneanddone
bomber
very
enjoyable
during
nbanhl
playoffs
pours
a
woodsy
redbrown
color
with
a
light
brown
head
aroma
of
sweet
malt
caramel
dark
fruit
raisins
and
a
bit
of
hops
really
nice
hop
forward
flavor
to
start
big
pine
resin
notes
to
start
a
bit
of
lemon
and
orange
zest
as
well
thick
caramel
and
dark

malts
come
next
and
power
their
way
through
the
finish
good
raisin
sweetness
plum
fig
and
dates
great
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
booze
wrap
it
up
overall
after
2
years
any
of
the
hops
are
long
gone
but
it
is
still
a
remarkable
complicated
beer
its
not
in
the
top
group
of
bws
but
after
2
years
in
the
cellar
for
a
pretty
inexpensive
price
there
is
a
lot
going
for
it
next
time
i
see
a
fresh
bottle
ill
buy1
to
taste
fresh
and
maybe
another
to
cellar
d
very
drinkable
considering
the
10
5
abv
fairly
strong
flavors
with
pretty
nice
balance
considering
the
complex
flavors
booze
flavor
is
present
but
kept
in
check
considering
fairly
high
level
o
if
you
like
malty
beers
try
this
one
its
hard
to
get
past
anything
but
the
huge
sweet
chewy
malt
mouth
i
liked
it
but
it
is
pretty
one
dimensional
overall
not
so
complex
really
if
the
flavors
were
more
discernable
i
might
rate
it
higher
its
a
good
flavor
just
not
a
lot
of
different
ones
going
on
o
one
of
the
better
beers
in
lagunitas
rotatingregular
lineup
this
is
no
surprise
to
an
awesome
brewery
who
is
capable
of
breaking
dimensions
and
curing
diseases
with
there
beers
o
if
the
malt
expressions
were
smoother
this
brew
would
be
hitting
a
lot
higher
decent
but
hardly
mind
blowing
this
is
pretty
good
im
still
a
bigfoot
fan
more
last
year
than
this
year
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
in
the
way
that
it
is
extremely
balanced
more
balanced
than
bigfoot
i
must
say
however
i
like
how
the
hops
in
bigfoot
can
be
over
the
top
at
times
and
i
feel
that
this
brew
plays
it
a
little
safer
still
good
though
pours
a
deep
ruby
redorange
hue
with
an
off
white
creamy
head
off
whitecream
head
smells
of
fruity
hops
malt
a
little
booze
the
first
sip
is
always
a
doozy
with
the
beer
burst
of
fruity
juice
hops
fallowed
by
a
blanket
of
thick
malt
with
a
nice
alcoholwarmth
finish
almost
a
little
bite
of
spice
hints
of
peaches
and
apples
covered
in
liquor
the
alcohol
in
this
one
definitely
finds
its
way
throughout
the
beer
and
works
nicely
with
the
hops
and
the
malts
separately
for
the
amount
of
malt
in
this
its
pretty
balanced
for
a
lagunitas
beer
ater
several
sips
and
letting
this
breath
the
malts
take
a
slight
back
seat
to
the
hops
which
begin
to
move
their
way
towards
the
finish
but
definitely
dont
sit
quietly
a
few
months
to
mature
wouldnt
hurt
the
beer
its
good
fresh
but
changes
from
aging
definitely
benefit
this
eer
overall
one
of
the
better
barleywines
around
malty
and
chewy
with
a
nice
hop
balance
good
fucking
beauty
and
the
beast
of
a
brew
that
walks
a
fine
line
between
overthetop
harshness
and
girlyman
weakness
wheres
my
flying
mouflan
fuller
body
decent
carbonation
tingly
and
sticky
nice
barleywine
alcohol
is
under
control
curious
to
see
what
age
does
to
this
one
although
the
hop
profile
was
a
high
point
for
me
overall
i
was
very
impressed
at
i
think
6
a
bomber
lagunitas
continues
to
beat
out
other
breweries
in
both
taste
and
price
o
this
has
good
drinkability
its
a
pretty
easy
going
brew
and
i
like
it
a
lot
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
even
considering
the
high
abv
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
and
id
pick
it
up
again
overall
this
is
a
heck
of
a
barleywine
one
i
would
recommend
to
any
palate
longing
for
a
suckerpunch
of
flavor
maybe
the
best
bw
ive
ever
had
d
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
barleywine
but
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
because
of
the
excess
sweetness
almost
like
a
sweetening
adjunct
was
added
to
boost
the
abv
o
this
is
a
really
good
barleywine
at
a
great
price
im
glad
i
finally
got
my
hands
on
a
bottle
of
this
one
a
very
good
and
supremely
delicious
and
drinkable
barleywine
not
nearly
as
complex
as
some
others
what
it
does
it
does
right
worth
trying
for
sure
and
probably
worth
picking
up
a
few
bottles
to
throw
under
the
stairs
good
price
at
6
too
i
should
have
grabbed
extra
oa
sold
american
barleywine
especially
considering
the
price
i
have
no
problem
putting
these
away
if
they
would
clean
up
the
twang
it
would
be
stellar
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
nice
reddish
hue
to
it
there
is
a
one
finger
head
that
is
tannish
and
gives
way
to
some
nice
retention
and
some
sticky
soapy
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
sweetness
up
front
cherries
and
pineapples
and
on
the
back
end
a
pine
and
earthy
hop
aroma
the
taste
has
a
nice
malt
backbone
with
dark
fruit
flavors
lemons
sweet
candy
and
then
a
nice
balance
of
pine
and
earthy
hops
to
balance
out
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
overall
this
is
a
great
drink
the
taste
is
big
bold
and
complex
along
with
the
smell
i
am
sure
two
bottles
would
be
needed
to
get
all
of
the
different
flavors
and
aromas
very
solid
barleywine
overall
a
great
barleywine
at
a
super
price
i
paid
4
49
lagunitas
is
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
and
this
is
another
stellar
offering
from
their
lineup
grab
it
if
you
see
it
o
overall
this
is
the
best
barley
wine
ive
had
to
date
abv
is
dangerously
well
hidden
and
the
flavours
are
complex
yet
delicious
definitely
a
must
try
to
any
fan
of
barley
wines
sweet
and
fairly
tasty
but
not
too
complex
i
probably
wont
buy
again
until
after
i
age
and
taste
my
second
bottle
overallthe
only
thing
i
would
have
liked
is
a
little
hoppier
finish
i
remember
it
being
a
little
hoppier
in
2010
although
it
may
just
be
that
my
palate
has
matured
this
beer
is
great
for
breakfast
lunch
dinner
and
the
best
time
desert
ive
never
been
very
dissapointed
with
lagunitas
and
this
brew
is
my
favorite
they
have
to
offerhop
stoopid
close
2nd
im
even
more
excited
now
knowing
that
lagunitas
is
expanding
keep
it
up
pours
medium
brown
with
red
hues
its
blood
red
when
held
up
to
the
light
fantastic
tan
head
with
phenomenal
retention
smells
is
so
much
like
pineapple
a
little
citrus
hops
with
some
brown
sugar
and
caramel
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
maple
syrup
undertones
in
the
taste
you
get
sweet
maple
with
some
bitter
grapefruit
ending
with
cooked
sweet
brown
sugar
and
semi
toasty
sweet
caramel
mouthfeel
is
heavenly
soft
smooth
and
pleasant
with
outstanding
carbonation
holy
sh
fantastic
excellent
amazing
beer
no
need
for
aging
this
america
barleywine
is
ready
to
be
drank
cheers
d
very
strong
bw
from
lagunitas
as
usual
i
think
a
year
has
mellowed
this
one
down
perfectly
o
this
is
an
awesome
barleywine
between
the
value
the
balance
and
the
huge
flavors
this
is
a
must
try
for
anyone
for
the
price
of
a
mere
5
for
a
22oz
pick
up
a
few
cant
wait
to
pop
one
open
next
year
above
avg
as
it
goes
for
barley
style
top
10
and
gets
extra
points
for
the
price
drinks
well
enough
for
the
style
but
this
isnt
one
im
going
to
have
all
the
time
as
its
a
bit
overpowering
i
think
ill
age
the
other
bottle
and
try
it
again
next
year
hoping
itll
mellow
out
d
this
is
basically
a
liquid
desert
so
sticky
sweet
and
the
high
octane
is
non
existant
dangerously
drinkable
o
its
kinda
like
a
less
cloying
version
of
brown
shugga
to
me
more
what
i
expect
in
a
barleywine
but
with
that
typical
lagunitas
flavor
for
3
49
its
a
steal
and
i
will
be
coming
back
over
and
over
not
quite
up
to
bigfoots
level
though
can
never
seem
to
let
lagunitas
stuff
sit
so
i
am
not
sure
i
can
ever
tell
you
how
it
will
be
cellared
pretty
killer
specimen
stacks
up
nicely
against
other
west
coast
comp
overall
this
is
a
nice
and
pleasant
sipper
not
as
complex
and
overwhelming
flavorwise
as
some
others
of
the
style
and
perhaps
a
bit
immature
drink
the
whole
22
oz
bottle
like
i
did
and
you
will
feel
its
mighty
presence

d
dangerously
drinkable
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
had
yet
the
liquid
is
dark
copper
with
red
hues
and
a
thick
filmy
off
white
head
that
took
awhile
to
separate
from
the
rest
of
the
beer
i
could
smell
some
orange
plums
white
wine
caramel
and
dates
with
a
hint
of
cherry
the
taste
consists
of
dates
molasses
and
orange
and
there
is
a
slightly
bitter
hoppy
aftertaste
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
this
beer
is
very
thick
has
low
carbonation
and
a
sticky
mouthfeel
for
how
heavy
the
gnarlywine
was
i
thought
it
drank
pretty
easy
its
definitely
a
sipper
though
honestly
this
is
pretty
lightweight
for
a
barley
wine
i
can
empathize
with
the
brewery
over
the
blurb
on
the
side
of
the
label
about
a
barley
wine
being
a
lot
like
raising
a
kid
yet
this
one
doesnt
live
up
to
expectations
it
almost
seems
like
it
is
watered
down
from
what
it
should
be
final
thought
4
this
beer
is
so
worth
a
try
and
then
some
youve
made
another
winner
here
lagunitas
one
of
the
best
bangs
for
your
buck
in
all
of
beerdom
d
it
is
quite
delicious
and
very
easy
to
drink
with
great
flavor
and
intensity
that
is
not
overwhelming
quite
good

snifter
more
red
than
expected
with
nice
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
smells
strongly
of
hops
grapefruit
and
citrus
that
i
can
smell
after
immediately
opening
the
bottle
the
taste
starts
with
malty
sweetness
and
develops
into
a
strong
hop
character
ending
with
a
bit
of
a
burn

is
surprisingly
dry
a
very
good
barlywine
pours

with
a

of
light
cherry
and
some
malty
sweetness
some
brown
sugar
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
adds
in
a
touch
of
booze
but
otherwise
keeps
pretty
similar
to
the
nose
there
is
a
sweetness
that
is
not
quite
cloying
but
pervades
throughout
nothing
too
complex
about
this
one
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
with
some
heat
in
the
finish
decent
example
of
the
style
good
grief
what
a
paragon
of
west
coast
barleywine
excellence
big
hops
big
malt
big
hibernating
booze
rock
on
bra
moreys
bottom
line
a
fullbodied
barleywine
this
is
more
thick
and
sweet
when
compared
with
brown

a
good
sipper
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
big
beer
d
wow
this
is
incredible
one
is
a
must
but
go
slow
the
alcohol
warmth
with
slither
into
your
legs
delicious
i
just
may
be
in
love
with
this
one
and
for
5
99
a
bomber
ill
be
buying
a
few
more
of
these
like
tomorrow
a
great
deal
on
a
truly
great
beer
such
a
nice
finish
to
this
bwine
and
extremely
drinkable
for
a
bwine
which
is
in
turn
also
quite
dangerous
when
coupled
with
the
fantastic
price
point
of
this
brew
lagunitas
does
it
again
tasty
beer
gnarlywine
is
as
close
as
ive
had
to
an
everyday
barleywine
its
delicious
approachable
and
has
a
dirinkability
that
belies
the
high
abv
overall
a
really
nice
take
on
the
american
barleywine
lagunitas
does
sweet
beers
better
than
most
and
at
a
price
few
can
beat
ill
be
cellaring
a
few
to
see
how
it
rounds
out
in
a
year
or
so
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
quickly
disappears
the
smell
is
of
malt
cherries
orange
and
spice
and
caramel
taste
is
really
interesting
all
of
the
above
w
alcohol
being
almost
completely
absent
at
10
6
abv
thats
pretty
amazing
also
getting
some
pine
taste
as
well
the
more
im
getting
into
the
bottle
this
is
a
big
tasting
beer
and
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
extremely
smooth
w
no
bite
or
major
aftertaste
this
beer
is
really
drinkable
almost
dangerously
so
a
great
representation
of
the
style
cheers
d
cannot
taste
the
alcohol
just
a
nice
fruity
piny
flavor
that
is
easy
to
down
very
solid
beer
d
effortless
to
drink
really
a
perfect
example
of
how
to
hide
your
booze
the
wet
and
clean
mouthfeel
makes
it
go
down
quick
and
easy
and
its
really
enjoyable
to
drink
a
big
winner
from
lagunitas
could
use
a
bit
more
definition
and
actual
flavor
from
the
hop
component
but
otherwise
it
is
spot
on
d
its
11
is
what
one
of
the
fellow
tasters
exclaimed
i
have
to
agree
i
didnt
realize
it
was
that
high
of
an
abv
as
i
was
drinking
it
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
at
all
i
could
drink
this
all
day
while
the
aroma
sounds
like
im
reviewing
negatively
im
not
the
smell
is
just
best
described
at
potato
chips
however
it
is
still
a
fantastic
aroma
and
overall
beer
d
11
and
hiding
it
well
theres
an
almost
complete
lack
of
booze
in
the
flavor
and
i
can
drink
this
like
its
nothing
im
thinking
this
may
hit
me
fast
and
before
i
know
it
its
a
rather
good
example
of
the
style
and
very
tasty
probably
easily
one
of
the
best
deals
out
there
for
a
solid
barleywine
i
cant
find
any
flaws
with
it
for
the
most
part
and
its
done
nothing
but
prove
that
its
worth
far
more
than
i
paid
for
it
d
simply
fantastic
for
a
barleywine
sweet
hoppy
smooth
and
creamy
all
in
one
bundle
you
will
be
hard
pressed
to
find
better
value
out
of
any
other
beer
let
alone
a
barleywine
im
blown
away
thank
you
lagunitas
for
your
amazing
prices
and
more
importantly
your
amazing
beers
poured
a
slow
to
emerge
1
5
head
which
slowly
dissipated
to
18
lovely
auburn
color
and
in
fact
when
held
up
to
the
light
theres
almost
a
raspberry
hue
smell
is
ipa
hops
and
maybe
some
fruit
or
citrus
taste
has
the
same
but
also
caramel
and
malt
medium
rich
body
with
a
nice
long
chest
warming
finish
nice
stuffy
drinkability
is
impressive
the
balancing
hops
prevent
the
sweetness
from
cloying
and
the
alcohol
is
evident
but
not
overwhelming
definitely
worth
a
try
for
those
who
enjoy
barley
wines
buy
more
and
age
its
very
easy
to
drink
its
not
too
brash
like
some
lagunitas
never
fails
to
please
me
and
this
big
beer
is
no
exception
you
combine
the
great
complex
taste
of
this
brew
with
its
relatively
low
cost
4
99
and
youve
got
another
winner
from
this
cali
brewery
i
really
like
what
lagunitas
is
doing
lately
sumpin
sumpin
brown
shugga
hairy
eyeball
and
this
whats
more
it
was
less
than
5
for
this
bomber
very
affordable
hope
to
find
some
more
soon
d
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
as
a
dessert
beer
the
high
abv
limits
consumption
however
dnot
my
favorite
barleywine
still
to
bitter
for
me
but
the
malt
sweetness
helps
make
up
for
that
drinkability
despite
having
the
predictable
lagunitas
hop
aroma
and
taste
this
is
a
surprisingly
easy
drinking
and
tasty
barleywine
nice
stuff
especially
for
5
a
bomber
d
gotta
love
lagunitas
and
for
that
matter
expect
them
to
bring
the
hops
regardless
of
the
style
this
is
a
great
take
on
their
version
of
the
barleywine
take
care
when
drinking
this
one
or
any
barleywine
because
itll
theyll
put
you
on
your
ass
there
was
an
odd
perhaps
off
note
of
sweet
cooked
green
cabbage
while
not
offputting
and
really
on
the
sweet
side
this
aroma
was
a
little
distracting
i
am
not
fully
accounting
for
this
possible
anomaly
in
my
score
this
is
just
a
solid
barleywine
and
this
is
also
very
inexpensive
this
is
a
great
value
beer
right
here
your
mileage
may
vary
i
do
not
like
hoppy
beers
and
i
dont
think
ive
reviewed
a
hoppy
beer
on
the
site
because
of
that
i
dont
think
a
hop
hater
should
bring
down
the
rating
of
a
category
that
i
usually
stay
away
from
but
i
was
at
my
local
hyvee
the
other
day
trying
to
pick
up
some
more
world
wide
stout
from
dogfish
head
a
story
for
another
day
but
it
was
only
7
79bottle
and
i
only
bought
2
when
i
got
back
they
were
all
gone
and
they
werent
getting
any
more
so
after
the
disappointment
wore
off
i
decided
to
try
something
new
the
young
kid
working
the
department
suggested
a
different
hoppy
beer
the
thing
that
got
me
was
limited
release
well
im
a
sucker
for
limited
release
anything
so
i
picked
up
a
lagunitas
gnarlywine
my
first
reaction
smells
like
grapefruit
and
in
my
opinion
beer
should
not
smell
like
grapefruit
juice
but
the
mouthfeel
thick
and
chewy
like
10w40
motor
oil
this
has
the
mouthfeel
of
a
good
stout
i
stuck
with
it
and
tried
to
enjoy
it
on
its
own
merit
instead
of
if
its
not
opaque
chewy
and
smells
like
coffeechocolate
i
wont
drink
it
and
i
found
out
something
i
can
like
a
hoppy
beer
its
not
my
favorite
but
i
like
it
and
if
there
are
any
hop
haters
out
there
that
love
stout
imperial
stout
high
abv
beers
give
this
a
shot
heck
give
it
a
couple
of
pints
you
might
change
your
mind
this
changed
mine
abv

hot
and
heavy
and
hoppy
d
exceedingly
drinkable
could
do
this
all
night
i
think
with
a
year
or
two
on
it
the
beer
could
shine
but
its
a
gamble
22oz
bottle
with
two
aught
11
on
the
front
pours
a
reddish
chestnut
color
with
a
very
thin
head
nice
lacing
aroma
is
malty
and
boozey
some
caramel
and
bready
aromas
as
well
taste
is
what
i
expected
warming
alcohol
with
maltiness
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
to
it
piney
hops
also
present
relatively
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
pretty
decent
barleywine
but
id
really
like
to
try
it
with
some
age
on
it
worth
picking
up
again
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
my
favorite
brewery
i
regret
not
writing
notes
from
my
earlier
tastings
because
this
years
seems
a
little
less
hoppy
than
how
i
remember
last
years
i
must
admit
those
bottles
in
my
beer
fridge
tempt
me
like
nothing
else
in
there
but
when
i
do
a
vertical
ill
definitely
post
my
notes
on
here
cheers
overall
i
had
this
one
fresh
so
the
flavours
havent
had
time
to
develop
yet
that
being
said
this
is
still
an
excellent
barleywine
tasty
affordable
and
cellerable
d
damn
this
is
very
good
i
need
to
hunt
down
more
of
this
perhaps
a
case
of
it
sip
with
caution
dthis
is
a
great
value
compared
to
other
barleywines
at
10
6
abv
at
3
99
a
22
oz
bomber
it
is
almost
too
good
to
be
true
i
have
paid
over
twice
this
amount
for
other
barleywines
if
this
is
what
it
can
be
called
sorry
to
say
this
is
very
sophomoric
for
lagunitas
which
is
increasingly
becoming
hit
or
miss
for
me
2011
version
pours
a
mostly
clear
darkish
red
fading
into
orange
like
a
reverse
cherryburst
dense
one
finger
thick

in
a
minute
leaving
a
few
spots
and
a

earthy

a
little

big
brown

mixed
with
mild

this
is
what
i
want
in
an
american
style
barleywine
big
hop
forward
booze
but
not
boozy
and
distinguishable
from
a
dipa
d
granted
i
havent
had
many
barleywines
but
this
goes
down
very
easily
very
drinkable
for
a
bwine
this
beer
is
a
big
disappointment
for
me
i
love
barley
wines
and
i
usually
like
lagunitas
however
this
beer
is
a
tough
one
to
finish
ill
admit
it
may
be
psychological
at
this
point
but
i
cannot
get
that
onioncured
meat
smell
from
bothering
me
i
dont
know
if
i
got
a
bad
bottlebatch
but
i
wish
there
was
a
batch
number
i
could
give
to
prevent
others
from
experiencing
this
if
that
is
the
case
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
to
double
check
and
at
4
49
a
bottle
i
think
i
will
two
things
i
love
about
og
the
price
and
the
fact
that
its
ready
to
drink
the
day
its
released
compare
bigfoot
which
is
a
superior
beer
but
needs
at
least
six
months
before
it
shows
its
true
colors
i
would
describe
og
as
maximuss
evil
twin
brother
similar
malt
and
hop
additions
but
the
former
eclipses
the
latter
rather
than
vice
versa
a
knockout
of
a
beer
but
not
one
to
sit
sip
and
contemplate
its
complexities
or
put
in
the
cellar
hoping
for
an
epic
transformation
drink
it
now
while
the
hops
are
still
hanging
around
to
balance
the
absurd
malt
sweetness
d
rather
well
done
at
less
than
5
for
a
bomber
it
might
be
the
best
deal
going
for
strong
ales
prost
very
good
try
it
if
you
have
the
chance
but
dont
knock
yourself
out
trying
to
obtain
it
highly
drinkable
so
tasty
and
deceptive
and
it
could
easily
6
abv
pours
a
crystal
clear
ruby
red
with
a
nice
light
tan
head
that
recedes
to
a
minimal
covering
some
good
lacing
on
the
glass
with
each
sip
so
far
so
good
smell
is
amazing
one
of
the
best
qualities
of
the
brew
starts
out
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
a
heaping
amount
of
earthy
and
piney
hops
some
brown
sugar
sweetness
and
a
helping
of
dark
ripened
fruit
tastes
pretty
gnarly
very
sweet
and
hoppy
with
a
noticeable
presence
of
booze
going
on
chewy
on
the
palate
malty
as
hell
with
a
good
twang
from
the
hops
and
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
heavy
body
with
moderate
carbonation
slick
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
nice
warmth
provided
by
the
booze
good
for
a
winter
night
i
personally
would
rather
split
this
bomber
but
seeing
that
my
wife
doesnt
partake
in
alcoholic
beverages
i
am
forced
to
consume
on
my
own
its
high
in
alcohol
and
it
doesnt
seem
to
hide
the
fact
but
its
an
interesting
and
flavorful
beer
overall
a
darn
good
beer
verdict
good
almost
excellent
not
elite
but
worth
tracking
down
a
complex
tasty
and
bold
but
well
balanced
sipper
an
excellent
barleywine
pours
a
deep
red
leaves
lace
smells
great
taste
is
just
about
perfectly
balanced
sweet
caramel
malts
and
alcohol
meet
a
generous
portion
of
hops
enjoyable
as
i
remember
it
being
a
year
or
so
ago
will
be
cellaring
a
couple
of
these
im
not
really
a
barleywine
guy
but
this
one
both
provides
bang
for
the
buck
and
doesnt
brain
you
with
booze
despite
turning
it
up
to
eleven
one
of
thew
best
ive
tried
from
the
style
d
for
an
american
barleywine
not
even
a
year
old
this
was
awfully
sweet
cloyingly
sweet
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
it
where
the
hell
are
the
hops
on
the
positives
side
the
alcohol
was
well
masked
d
for
being
11
abv
it
is
really
drinkable
one
of
the
most
drinkable
barleywines
ive
ever
had
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
viscous
and
sticky
pretty
drinkable
when
considered
amongst
other
barleywines
future
outlook
really
excellent
repeat
business
eminent
another
good
big
beer
from
lagunitas
that
i
want
to
try
cellaring
d
a
bit
too
sweet
and
high
in
abv
to
drink
more
than
one
absolutely
delicious
however
and
i
will
be
buying
some
more
of
these
to
cellar
this
is
a
must
try
for
fans
of
barleywines
and
i
believe
that
it
will
be
an
excellent
example
of
the
variant
effect
that
aging
has
on
a
barleywines
character
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
very
big
and
malty
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
to
hold
onto
for
a
little
while
drinkable
yep
i
liked
the
style
pretty
well
i
had
been
intimidated
by
barleywines
but
ive
come
away
less
so
still
it
might
be
a
while
before
i
jump
in
with
both
feet
i
had
this
at
a
tasting
around
halloween
somehow
i
forgot
to
rate
it
but
i
do
remember
fluffy
long
lasting
tan
head
beautiful
clear
dark
brown
body
aroma
of
roasted
barley
malt
with
cocoa
caramel
and
butter
nutty
caramel
sweet
flavor
disguising
the
alcohol
very
well
hop
notes
on
top
of
it
as
well
soft
smooth
pleasant
goodi
can
keep
going
with
this
one
close
to
perfection
nice
bitter
sweet
and
surprising
low
carbonatiion
long
lasting
taste
on
the
palate
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
however
theres
not
a
single
thing
about
that
makes
me
excited
to
have
another
a
very
clean
very
vanilla
barleywine
thats
worth
a
shot
d
this
beer
was
a
beast
of
a
beer
that
i
enjoyed
the
abv
is
well
hidden
till
the
very
end
but
i
couldnt
complain
at
all
about
that
i
just
wish
this
brewery
would
come
into
the
state
already
though
murky
brown
pour
with
moderate
sized
head
nose
has
some
rum
and
cherry
coughdrop
elements
palate
is
syrupy
sweet
with
some
of
that
medicinal
cherry
and
piney
citrusy
hops
rounding
it
out
finish
is
sweet
and
alcohol
warm
with
a
suggestion
of
black
tea
good
drinkability
for
10
hoppy
and
bitter
tasty
complex
barleywine
dnot
through
the
roof
drinkability
wise
maybe
a
little
hot
right
now
furthermore
olde
gnarlywine
is
a
fullbodied
beast
viscous
and
slightly
boozy
but
at
the
same
time
quite
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
warmerupper
if
i
have
ever
experienced
one
a
solid
brew
that
will
definitely
improve
with
some
age
notes
this
one
will
warm
you
up
very
well
this
one
very
drinkable
cheers
great
beer
great
name
the
color
is
dark
rich
red
to
auburn
it
reminds
me
of
the
fall
the
scent
is
rich
malts
with
minimal
hopsfloral
influence
minimal
head
with
fair
lacing
the
taste
is
strong
malt
with
some
fruitiness
to
it
my
initial
sip
i
was
thinking
grapes
sweet
grapes
with
a
rich
backbone
of
hops
to
balance
it
out
i
would
also
say
raisins
and
a
bit
of
spice
nothing
overwhelming
just
a
solid
barleywine
the
aftertaste
is
good
leaving
a
bit
of
the
hops
to
keep
you
thirsting
for
more
the
beer
does
have
a
decent
alcohol
flavor
making
it
not
the
most
drinkable
of
beers
served
in
a
glass
mug
drank
at
my
desk
being
a
fan
of
barleywines
i
cant
help
but
be
smitten
with
this
beer
the
color
is
exceptional
and
the
transparentcy
looks
filtered
for
an
unfiltered
beer
wonderfully
smooth
gnarly
wine
covers
the
fire
with
outstanding
carmel
malt
and
the
aftertaste
leaves
you
with
hops
lining
the
back
of
your
throat
the
nose
is
fruity
with
a
hint
of
sour
alcohol
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
at
11
abv
ive
seen
this
on
the
shelves
a
number
of
times
but
have
never
been
able
to
pull
the
trigger
it
pours
a
translucent
deep
amberbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
biscuits
buttery
toffee
and
some
light
red
grapes
the
taste
follows
adding
caramel
and
some
citrus
hops
to
the
finish
the
body
is
a
heavy
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
rather
thick
feel
overall
not
a
bad
barleywine
at
all
but
not
really
anything
special
d
well
i
really
like
lagunitas
other
offerings
and
really
wouldnt
see
myself
trying
it
again
but
it
was
a
fairly
smooth
barley
wine
decent
beer
overall
very
good
bw
alcohol
is
masked
well
taste
is
very
good
and
its
just
a
very
solid
beer
lots
of
booze
but
still
very
drinkable
an
all
around
solid
barleywine
that
is
budget
friendly
as
well
amber
red
clear
body
with
some
trails
of
carbonation
rising
from
bottom
of
glass
one
finger
white
head
medium
dissipation
with
significant
lacing
pretty
big
hop
hit
upfront
in
the
nose
citrus
and
pine
bready
and
caramel
malt
notes
for
balance
taste
is
pretty
sweet
close
to
style
citrus
and
bitter
hops
towards
the
backend
mouthfeel
features
minimal
carbonation
not
much
stickiness
despite
sweetness
at
this
abv
you
better
be
careful
if
there
was
a
value
category
at
4
99
this
would
be
a
5
while
its
not
the
most
balanced
offering
i
can
see
this
as
a
nice
gateway
into
the
world
of
barleywines
certainly
different
and
a
good
night
cap
on
which
to
end
my
2nd
allocated
drinking
day
on
my
us
road
trip
this
barleywine
comes
out
of
the
tap
an
opaque
mahogany
with
a
finebubbled
beige
head
aroma
is
strong
malty
and
a
little
fruity
like
a
brandy
fruity
and
malty
flavor
has
a
fierce
alcohol
bite
to
it
like
any
good
barleywine
texture
is
lively
fizzy
and
fiercely
edgy
pours
a
dark
copperamber
color
with
a
huge
rocky
white
head
nice
hop
aromas
waft
from
the
glass
along
with
a
backing
caramel
note
flavors
of
brown
sugar
caramel
and
hops
alcohol
makes
itself
known
eventually
but
it
is
not
at
all
a
major
player
this
is
a
great
barley
wine
often
underrated
but
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
deep
ruby
caramel
amber
hue
wih
a
khaki
head
flowing
thick
and
strong
cloudy
head
forms
nicely
and
the
lacing
forms
evenly
down
the
sides
of
my
glass
with
big
occasional
chunks
of
head
stickin
around
aroma
super
hopped
with
pinecitrusearthy
qualities
abound
i
understand
they
use
hop
extracts
at
lagunitas
but
they
are
working
it
in
this
brew
super
caramel
and
barley
sweet
malts
going
on
with
a
nice
wave
of
hops
flavor
is
excellent
a
nice
collision
of
malt
and
hops
an
onslaught
of
pine
cone
accented
hop
intensity
that
i
frankly
love
straight
up
west
coast
aggressive
barleywine
thats
bringing
it
for
4
99
a
bomber
this
cant
be
beat
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
carbonation
is
mellow
and
i
cant
describe
how
nice
the
bitterness
its
the
palate
in
the
most
abusive
yet
gentle
way
drinkability
is
great
especially
with
close
friends
imagine
a
nice
tenured
version
of
bigfoot
this
is
it
bring
it
on
tell
your
friends
hell
tell
your
mom
nice
and
boozy
just
the
way
i
like
my
barleywines
delicious
d
a
unique
and
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
the
alcohol
content
is
pretty
well
hidden
aside
from
the
warming
aspect
d
the
beer
is
good
to
sip
but
theres
no
way
that
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
the
strength
makes
this
one
less
drinkable
than
some
beers
but
id
absolutely
give
it
another
try
d
easily
drinkable
even
though
this
is
still
a
sipper
even
easier
if
you
are
a
hophead
this
is
my
third
meeting
with
olde
gnarleywinethe
first
in
a
bottle
a
month
ago
the
second
one
on
tap
at
split
thy
skull
fest
in
philadelphia
and
now
thisand
i
have
to
rank
it
up
there
with
my
absolute
favorites
barleywine
or
otherwise
this
is
what
its
all
about
overall
this
beer
is
definitely
drinkable
and
is
held
back
slightly
by
the
intensity
of
flavor
and
the
abv
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
but
could
not
tolerate
a
session
this
is
quite
possibly
one
of
the
best
bombers
ive
had
for
the
price
less
than
5
bucks
served
in
a
pint
glass
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
orange
head
strong
scents
of
sweetness
of
caramel
along
with
candied
fruits
the
flavor
profile
included
a
soft
malts
dark
dried
fruits
and
apples
a
lot
of
hops
the
fresh
hop
taste
is
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
very
drinkable
for
the
heavy
alcohol
content
complex
but
also
pretty
easy
to
sip
on
enjoy
responsibly
as
they
say
id
like
to
give
this
one
more
for
drinkability
but
the
abv
and
the
sweetness
make
this
impossible
for
me
to
enjoy
more
than
one
of
these
which
is
no
reflection
on
the
beer
itself
or
the
people
who
concocted
it
its
something
i
will
buy
again
and
enjoy
perfectly
sippable
definitely
a
slow
drinker
but
very
enjoyable
this
was
a
really
good
experience
though
i
couldnt
help
but
thinking
that
there
was
just
something
missing
or
something
a
little
out
of
place
it
is
very
close
to
perfect
but
just
barely
falls
short
in
some
areas
bringing
down
the
overall
beer
pours
a
very
pretty
amberred
color
with
about
an
inch
of
dense
sandy
head
nice
lacing
smell
is
decent
big
caramel
malts
some
herbalpiney
hops
typical
american
barleywine
nose
taste
is
quite
good
with
again
big
caramel
and
lightly
toasted
malt
and
big
piney
hops
i
think
this
is
where
some
of
it
falls
short
for
me
it
has
huge
flavors
but
it
lacks
a
bit
of
balance
of
sweetness
vs
bitternessthe
caramel
is
almost
cloying
very
big
flavors
from
the
malt
but
i
feel
as
though
its
almost
unidimensionali
wish
there
was
something
spicy
or
something
toasty
or
something
else
to
back
it
up
mf
is
mediumfull
creamy
smooth
good
stuff
allaround
drinkability
is
fantastic
considering
the
abv
though
some
alcohol
comes
out
as
it
warms
a
good
beer
just
barely
misses
the
incredible
mark
in
my
book
just
a
few
tweaks
could
make
this
perfect
but
as
such
it
falls
short
definitely
a
steal
at
5
per
22
oz
though
drinkability
couldnt
handle
many
more
because
of
the
alcohol
content
but
really
great
d
great
barleywine
nice
and
hoppy
yet
balanced
by
the
fruity
toastedness
very
good
as
for
overall
drinkability
it
is
probably
in
line
with
most
barleywines
this
is
one
you
want
to
drink
slowly
honestly
with
how
sweet
it
is
i
dont
see
how
you
cant
sip
this
guy
for
a
while
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
pick
up
and
share
as
an
affordable
after
dinner
treat
smoother
with
less
of
a
hop
edge
much
more
balance
bumped
up
the
taste
and
drinkability
cant
wait
for
double
aught
11
interestingly
enough
the
20
ought
8
version
of
this
brew
was
9
7
are
they
getting
more
and
more
intoxicating
d
a
solid
barleywine
that
from
its
taste
shows
it
has
tons
of
life
left
in
it
plenty
of
oomph
behind
this
guy
a
great
beer
to
curl
up
by
the
fire
on
a
cold
winters
night
just
a
plain
good
barleywine
that
doesnt
throw
any
curves
at
you
simple
yet
good
i
would
really
like
to
compare
this
to
an
aged
bottle
i
feel
like
an
older
one
would
be
really
forward
on
the
berries
this
is
a
big
beer
and
i
need
to
alter
some
of
my
scores
very
big
caramel
and
nutty
flavor
huge
malt
flavor
and
the
hops
are
perfectly
muted
for
a
bw
overall
this
was
a
decent
american
bw
but
i
have
had
better
worth
a
shot
though
d
well
its
a
little
heavy
i
like
this
style
so
i
didnt
have
a
problem
finishing
it
d
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
one
that
should
probably
be
laid
down
for
a
least
a
year
the
alcohol
and
hops
are
very
strong
right
now
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
goblet
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
laced
pretty
well
throughout
initial
alcohol
aroma
doesnt
last
long
as
the
malts
take
over
flavors
have
an
initial
strong
malt
but
the
hops
balance
nicely
on
the
finish
feel
is
definitely
warm
from
the
alcohol
with
some
distinct
oiliness
in
this
mediumbodied
beer
overall
very
good
barleywine
with
great
balance
and
appropriate
flavorings
d
it
took
everything
i
had
to
get
this
beer
down
i
just
couldnt
get
over
the
sweet
orange
juice
flavor
intermixed
with
the
malt
and
alcohol
for
me
this
beer
was
almost
unbearable
d
it
keeps
me
wanting
more
the
bottle
says
that
the
fourth
sip
is
for
pure
madness
i
think
im
about
to
go
for
my
fifth
sip
well
see
where
it
heads
my
gnarlywine
is
warming
gotta
go
i
wont
buy
this
again
but
id
love
to
taste
it
again
if
someone
i
know
has
it
in
their
fridge
poured
from
a
bomber
into
snifter
on
3110
golden
red
color
with
a
thin
tan
1
finger
head
faint
lacing
smells
of
fruit
citrus
maybe
banana
and
slight
caramel
malt
the
taste
follows
with
more
citrus
fruit
and
hops
slightly
sweet
maltiness
nicely
balanced
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
dangerously
so
i
plan
on
setting
a
few
bottles
in
the
cellar
d
very
tough
to
drink
with
copious
amounts
of
alcoholic
bite
the
term
alcoholic
warmth
is
hardly
appropriate
as
it
goes
down
i
do
like
some
barleywines
but
this
one
is
clearly
not
for
me
cant
even
finish
14
of
this
glass
lagunitas
does
it
again
another
quality
bomber
for
4
the
value
of
this
beer
is
exceptional
i
already
know
this
will
find
its
way
into
my
fridge
again
next
to
hop
stoopid
it
was
an
interesting
mixture
and
a
not
all
together
bad
one
you
certainly
dont
need
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
overall
great
beer
it
wasnt
overhopped
or
to
sweet
d
a
great
barleywine
would
be
great
at
the
end
of
a
long
cold
day
drinkability
this
is
a
really
good
barleywine
not
the
biggest
malt
flavor
but
part
of
that
may
improve
with
age
its
relatively
cheap
so
ill
definitely
get
another
to
age
overall
a
really
good
version
of
the
style
not
as
good
as
hog
heaven
but
right
up
there
with
the
best
ive
tried
d
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
fantastic
overall
beer
love
this
and
will
lay
some
down
for
the
future
overall
just
an
excellent
example
of
the
american
barleywine
style
it
doesnt
have
the
flashy
bal
aged
notes
or
any
of
that
but
its
hard
to
deny
that
its
damned
good
d
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
barleywine
style
ale
but
i
am
very
impressed
very
easy
to
drink
and
it
hides
its
alcohol
content
well
d
upon
first
wiff
i
thought
i
may
have
found
a
replacement
for
bigfoot
as
my
fav
bw
but
this
one
just
doesnt
hold
the
weight
as
well
great
brew
but
not
nearly
as
great
as
it
could
be
i
think
the
flavors
are
a
little
light
the
flavors
that
are
there
are
great
and
well
molded
but
not
powerful
enough
which
is
suprising
because
the
high
abv
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
2007
vintage
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
just
over
3
years
of
age
this
is
an
absolute
treat
small
but
nice
head
stays
for
a
while
on
a
cloudy
ruby
body
the
aroma
rises
out
of
the
glass
and
is
just
begging
for
attention
its
crazy
intense
with
sweet
malts
some
alcohol
dark
fruits
and
vanilla
the
taste
is
incredibly
mellow
with
sweet
vanilla
and
sweet
malts
dominate
the
taste
a
sipper
but
the
abv
is
beautifully
hidden
makes
me
want
to
never
drink
a
fresh
barleywine
ever
again
wonderfully
aged
and
a
real
gem
awesome
plain
and
simple
d
too
syrupy
to
drink
very
much
of
not
that
i
would
want
to
drink
too
much
of
such
a
strong
beer
but
it
is
still
an
enjoyable
one
even
if
i
would
only
reach
for
one
in
a
sitting
the
alcohol
hides
itself
rather
well
and
this
helps
give
it
a
rather
high
drinkability
for
a
11
barley
wine
the
hops
are
also
not
so
bittering
that
it
destroys
the
pallate
too
quickly
nice
and
easy
drinking
for
an
american
barley
wine
for
sure
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thicker
than
medium
but
not
syrupy
did
a
great
job
of
coating
the
palate
this
is
definately
a
beer
to
share
flavors
arent
harsh
but
the
alcohol
does
get
you
im
glad
i
grabbed
a
couple
of
these
because
it
was
amazing
mouthfeel
is
medium
heavy
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
slight
pierce
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
creamy
amount
of
carbonation
thanks
lagunitas
you
rarely
disappoint
this
beer
is
thick
and
chewy
with
plenty
of
malty
sweetness
boozeladen
fruits
and
citrus
rind
the
finish
is
a
little
hot
but
still
very
nice
this
ones
a
winner
now
and
will
only
get
better
with
some
age
drinkability
excellent
i
loved
this
barleywine
this
beer
is
nothing
short
of
great
very
tasty
hides
the
alcohol
well
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
treat
but
also
gives
you
something
different
than
most
barley
wines
with
the
hoppiness
factor
look
for
it
its
easy
to
like
poured
into
my
flying
saucer
christmas
2009
glass
sweet
glass
pours
a
dark
reddish
hue
with
a
12
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
the
aroma
is
that
of
a
spices
including
cinnamon
and
orange
peel
maybe
hops
and
some
sweet
sugars
the
taste
is
a
bit
sweeter
to
begin
with
than
other
barleywines
the
hops
show
up
quickly
to
put
the
sweetness
to
bed
and
it
finishes
with
a
nice
light
citrus
the
hops
dont
ever
really
take
over
but
there
is
no
doubt
they
have
a
strong
presence
this
is
an
amazingly
drinkable
barleywine
and
just
another
great
lagunitas
offering
and
for
the
price
cannot
be
beat
i
love
me
some
barleywines
the
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
and
pretty
thick
with
fairly
low
carbonation
that
compliments
the
style
i
shared
the
bomber
but
could
easily
down
one
on
my
own
in
fact
i
think
i
will
the
price
is
right
too
lagnunitas
has
never
wowed
me
but
this
beer
is
a
welcome
exception

very

split
a
growler
of
it
no
problem
drinkability
i
thought
this
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
that
i
hope
to
revisit
from
time
to
time
although
categorized
as
an
american
barleywine
this
beer
at
its
present
age
reminds
me
in
many
ways
of
an
english
style
and
actually
has
some
similarities
to
the
j
w
lees
harvest
ales
i
had
a
few
weeks
back
it
is
best
consumed
as
an
after
dinner
treat
or
instead
of
a
dessert
toasted
malt
and
herbal
bitterness
up
front
big
malt
sweetness
soon
follows
notes
of
toffee
caramel
and
bread
pudding
some
rummy
fruit
and
maybe
a
dash
of
sherry
in
there
as
well
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
pick
it
up
after
the
huge
wave
of
malt
sweetness
sticky
resinous
sappy
flavors
turn
to
herbal
woody
and
even
minty
big
toffee
malt
sweetness
lingers
into
the
long
warming
finish
i
also
picked
up
a
little
citrus
right
at
the
end
yummy
maltier
than
i
expected
with
a
full
body
and
a
thick
creamy
feel
well
done
lagunitas
drinkability
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
and
malt
sweetness
combined
with
a
nice
hop
presence
lends
itself
to
a
highly
drinkable
vintage
the
flavors
seduce
the
palate
and
beg
to
be
savored
drinkability
grab
one
and
save
it
this
is
great
stuff
i
wonder
what
a
2002
would
taste
like
lagunitas
is
starting
to
creep
its
way
into
my
top
five
american
breweries
if
its
not
there
already
consistency
should
be
somewhere
in
their
name
all
the
time
excellent
work
from
the
petaluma
crew
part
of
why
i
was
looking
for
more
was
because
i
had
gnarlywine
on
tap
at
burp
castle
in
the
east
village
a
few
months
ago
and
loved
it
the
drinkability
was
amazing
i
had
several
and
came
back
for
it
the
next
night
the
flavor
very
deep
and
the
hopmalt
balance
perfect
i
hope
to
find
the
beer
again
on
a
good
tap
im
sure
it
will
rate
higher
if
its
anything
like
i
remember
im
not
sure
if
they
had
aged
it
but
it
was
a
lot
better
than
the
bottle
this
beer
was
good
but
lagunitas
makes
better
beers
like
imperial
red
brown
shugga
and
sold
in
sixers
d
very
drinkable
i
had
to
fight
myself
to
slow
down
olde
gnarlywine
is
an
interesting
americanstyle
barleywine
although
it
has
its
flaws
i
am
nevertheless
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
sample
it
ontap
pours
extremely
thicksyrupy
and
orangeredbrownish
in
color
smells
and
tastes
very
sweet
again
like
the
appearance
it
is
syrupy
and
thick
even
for
a
barleywine
those
arent
necessarily
bad
things
mouthfeel
definitely
a
sipping
beer
like
most
barleywines
i
dont
think
the
strength
of
this
2008
was
11
i
believe
the
bottle
indicated
it
was
9
7
not
drinkable
but
excellent
for
sipping
outdoors
on
a
cold
december
evening
couldnt
really
detect
much
of
a
hop
presence
especially
for
lagunitas
rusty
red
brew
has
a
decent
thick
foamy
white
head
aroma
is
very
sweet
lots
of
honey
and
brown
sugar
with
hints
or
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
good
citric
hoppy
kick
as
well
very
malty
aroma
lends
itself
to
the
taste
which
borders
on
an
english
barleywine
very
sweet
like
cocoa
and
caramel
but
the
hops
really
dont
come
through
as
they
should
in
the
syle
this
is
a
2009
but
it
tastes
aged
as
the
hops
are
not
to
be
found
in
this
brew
still
an
enjoyable
brew
but
hoppy
barleywine
lovers
might
want
to
look
elsewhere
this
barleywine
has
balls
absolutely
delicious
taste
is
not
too
far
from
the
smell
expectedly
sweet
reminds
me
of
almond
syrup
at
times
a
little
bitterness
on
the
finish
not
too
many
hops
im
detecting
in
this
for
being
11
and
on
the
sweet
side
it
drinks
fairly
easy
id
like
to
see
how
this
changes
after
a
couple
years
d
cold
weather
is
acomin
feels
good
to
drink
something
a
little
heavier
im
not
putting
a
bunch
of
this
down
in
1
sitting
but
it
is
a
22
so
i
would
buy
this
again
when
looking
for
a
bwine
not
my
all
time
favorite
but
really
good
this
one
leaves
a
huge
head
with
lots
of
thick
sticky
lace
big
time
caramel
malt
with
a
deep
butterscotch
flavor
the
nose
is
big
time
melted
caramel
caramel
brown
sugar
and
honey
very
rich
and
full
bodied
with
a
heavy
creamy
feel
to
it
wish
it
was
more
chewy
and
less
dry
in
the
finish
very
affordable
pricing
makes
this
one
an
easy
choice
3
5
gnarlywine
is
pretty
nice
but
i
wont
be
stocking
up
unless
theres
a
clearance
this
will
only
seem
sweeter
with
age
and
its
already
awful
sweet
overall
i
liked
this
beer
it
reminded
me
of
a
less
robust
bigfoot
however
the
fact
that
i
picked
it
up
for
less
than
5
makes
this
a
great
value

it
was

can
see

getting
sickening

2009

is
a
deep
ruby
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
quickly
settles
down
to
just
a
thin
layer
of
fine
bubbles
on
top
of
the
glass
and
leaves
hella
lacing
being
a
westcoast
barleywine
i
was
expecting
a
hop
bomb
on
the
nose
but
its
actually
pretty
well
balanced
with
the
citrusy
piney
hops
being
countered
with
a
toasty
caramel
maltiness
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
is
perceivable
the
initial
taste
confirms
the
nose
that
there
is
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
but
there
is
a
whole
additional
level
of
complexity
grapefruit
dominates
with
sweet
heavy
dextrins
as
a
backdrop
that
reflect
caramel
and
dried
fruits
like
figs
and
raisins
the
alcohol
is
much
more
apparent
in
the
taste
than
it
is
in
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
reserved
yet
creamy
carbonation
and
a
dry
alcohol
burn
finish
i
could
have
used
some
more
west
coast
hops
drinkabilitywise
this
would
be
a
wise
brew
to
sip
and
enjoy
because
the
11
could
be
rough
excellent
beer
but
i
really
was
surprised
that
there
was
not
a
much
bigger
hop
presence
considering
this
is
a
west
coast
american
barleywine
and
it
is
only
a
2009
vintage
there
should
be
huge
hops
imo
overall
a
very
nice
and
textbook
american
style
barleywine
to
be
honest
i
am
not
a
gigantic
fan
of
it
but
it
is
so
accurate
to
style
that
i
cant
help
but
give
it
high
marks
im
a
fan
of
it
just
not
a
gigantic
fan
of
it
i
know
that
sounds
wierd
but
its
hard
to
explain
it
is
totally
to
style
but
there
is
just
no
unique
flare
to
it
i
would
like
the
balance
to
shift
a
little
bit
to
be
more
clear
a
touch
more
hops
and
a
touch
less
stickiness
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
i
just
cant
get
really
excited
about
this
one
that
being
said
this
is
certainly
a
fine
barleywine
and
one
i
enjoy
and
will
drink
again
without
a
doubt
glad
i
picked
a
few
up
for
the
cellar
smallish
head
of
cream
white
to
brown
leaves
a
sheet
of
lacing
which
slowly
slides
down
the
glass
sides
after
a
minute
or
so
the
head
has
fully
dissolved
strong
amber
color
as
much
orange
as
brown
fairly
clean
for
the
style
the
nose
displays
some
restraint
and
doesnt
push
the
sweetness
too
much
caramel
honey
tangerine
and
mandarin
orange
citrus
indian
spices
the
plum
raisin
fruit
scents
balanced
by
fresher
apricot
and
peach
notes
while
knit
into
the
whole
well
theres
more
general
hoppiness
than
many
peers
fullbodied
sticky
clings
to
your
mouth
pores
like
glue
things
more
amplified
here
the
carbonation
helps
to
separate
the
elements
the
pink
grapefruit
to
tangerine
citrus
gets
out
in
front
of
the
pack
brown
sugar
caramel
and
honey
compact
and
not
sweeter
than
any
other
component
there
is
a
lively
dark
roasted
coffee
bean
edge
not
bready
or
doughy
really
you
get
a
nice
floral
lift
though
here
the
apricot
peach
nectarine
fruit
leads
you
might
even
discern
more
pineapple
than
raisin
date
or
fig
flavors
has
the
weight
and
texture
of
barleywine
but
in
many
respects
deviates
from
the
norm
interesting
2009
version
i
can
t
tell
this
breweries
beer
styles
apart
they
have
low
alcohol
strong
ales
that
they
call
red
ales
hoppy
barleywines
that
they
call
double
ipas
etc
this
is
another
of
what
i
believe
to
be
their
hybrid
beers
which
like
many
of
their
others
is
a
good
beer
worth
trying
not
my
favorite
barley
or
lagunitas
brandthis
beer
has
good
color
and
aroma
and
is
worthwhile
if
you
see
it
on
the
shelves
super
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
considering
the
strength
of
the
brew
deadly
nice
barleywine
to
sip
the
night
away
on
solid
example
pours
a
nice
light
mahogany
with
a
wispy
beige
head
and
is
for
all
purposes
a
nice
looking
barleywine
rich
brown
sugar
on
the
nose
underpinned
by
earthiness
and
a
chop
backing
a
touch
of
alcohol
too
but
thats
to
be
expected
good
hoppy
flavour
with
a
delightful
splash
of
citrus
and
pine
and
a
lasting
bitterness
this
is
balanced
quite
well
by
a
brown
sugar
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
sherry
fullbodied
medium
carbonation
and
warming
lagunitas
know
how
to
use
their
hops
to
good
effect
recommended
pretty
good
eventually
i
will
have
to
pick
up
a
completely
fresh
bottle
to
compare
but
this
one
seems
to
have
lost
some
shine
pretty
quickly
whats
not
to
love
here
j
not
a
typical
barleywine
hoppiness
is
replaced
entirely
with
sweetness
more
like
a
sweet
quad
than
anything
else
very
good
beer
and
i
am
curious
if
the
bottled
version
is
as
good
the
beer
pours
into
the
glass
to
reveal
a
hazy
ambermaple
color
the
aroma
is
very
strong
and
sweet
and
consists
of
raisin
and
apricot
the
mouthfeel
is
about
average
for
a
barleywine
style
but
has
a
nice
buttery
alcohol
feel
on
the
lips
the
taste
is
very
sweet
with
a
moderate
raisin
component
the
ale
finishes
with
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
warmth
and
a
small
amount
of
alcohol
taste
there
is
not
much
of
a
hop
component
to
this
ale
which
i
generally
like
in
the
finish
of
barleywine
styles
or
as
an
after
dinner
treat
moderate
carbonation
and
only
a
slight
amount
of
alcohol
make
this
an
easily
and
dangerously
drinkable
beer
poured
into
chalice
an
amber
red
with
thin
white
head
good
lacing
smells
of
hints
of
grapefruit
taste
is
sweet
up
front
from
the
grapefruit
flavors
and
theres
actually
a
good
bite
to
the
end
of
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
low
in
carbonation
the
alcohol
level
is
noticable
but
it
doesnt
take
away
from
the
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
barleywine
however
it
could
have
some
improvements
this
beer
is
a
gorgeous
color
dark
brown
with
touches
of
mahogany
on
the
edges
a
small
light
head
dissipates
to
almost
nothing
aromas
and
flavors
strongly
feature
dark
fruits
especially
black
currant
its
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
very
sweet
aftertaste
that
makes
this
beer
good
for
dessert
yet
another
lagunitas
goody
d
this
bottle
is
a
year
old
and
it
is
very
smooth
the
taste
does
not
really
have
anything
that
pops
out
at
me
and
make
this
beer
different
though
a
solid
example
of
the
style
drinkability
taste
is
extremely
strong
making
it
a
sipping
beer
perhaps
too
strong
for
some
its
good
in
the
way
that
its
flavors
are
complex
and
it
evokes
a
lot
of
mystery
however
this
makes
it
a
beer
that
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
often
but
at
times
would
provide
an
interesting
beer
experience
this
is
my
first
barley
wine
beer
so
i
have
no
comparison
but
i
will
be
trying
others

i
think
i
am
going
to
pick
up
another
bottle
and
leave
it
in
the
cellar
for
a
while
to
see
how
well
it
ages
as
suggested
on
the
bottle
to
me
there
are
not
to
many
things
better

speaking
than
a

a
great
value
in

its

price
of
most
barleywines
pour
a
sturdy
frothy

head
in
my
tulip
glass
with
plenty
of
sheeting
and
lacework
on
the
glass
nice
dark
orange
color
aroma
of
a
little
toffee
flavor
is
a
rather
sweet
with
a
complex
toffeelike
flavor
and
some
earthy
and
resiny
hops
underneath
very
creamy
silky
mouthfeel
all
the
way
to
the
end
could
not
taste
any
of
the
alcohol
got
a
little
bitter
as
it
warmed
up
but
all
and
all
a
strong
barleywine
this
is
a
fine
barleywine
and
a
real
bargain
at
the
price
im
going
to
put
one
away
for
next
year
and
see
what
a
little
aging
does
for
it
d
good
drinkability
having
an
abv
of
11

making
it

a

throat
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
this
style
drinkability
drinks
lighter
than
the
11
listed
on
the
bottle
but
the
statement
on
the
label
has
a
measure
of
truth
to
it
the
first
sip
is
for
thirst
the
second
one
for
pleasure
the
third
sip
is
for
knowing
and
the
fourth
for
pure
madness
this
is
a
solid
barleywine
that
has
all
the
prerequisites
of
the
style
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
on
any
aspects
but
its
a
good
sweet
drinkable
brew
edit
2011
version
in
2014
is
quite
different
better
i
really
like
this
although
its
young
you
can
taste
the
potential
this
barleywine
is
going
to
be
great
in
a
year
and
probably
be
awesome
in
two
or
more
years
but
even
being
young
i
loved
the
malty
sweetness
with
that
hop
punch
its
a
good
balance
that
i
think
will
age
well
mellow
out
and
just
be
fantastic
im
storing
bottle
of
this
for
sure
d
great
closer
ideal
beverage
for
a
campfire
or
sitting
in
a
robe
feet
near
an
enchanted
hearth
take
you
time
with
this
one
and
dont
have
any
ambitious
plans
afterward
the
last
sip
remains
just
as
good
as
the
first
glows
as
it
warms
up
this
wasnt
my
favorite
barleywine
as
i
think
it
was
lagging
just
a
little
behind
some
of
my
favorites
but
it
was
still
delicious

for
a

at

cant
beat
that
pours
a

and
perfectly
clear
with
a
nice
wellretained
white

thick

a
very
pretty
beer
nice

malt
on

with
a
hint
of
brandy
and
pine
sap
flavor
is
quite
bitter
but
balanced
by
the
big
full
malt
body
and
strong
alcohol
alcohol
a
bit
hot
but
manageable
and
the
malt
is
nicely
laced
with
cherry
and
plums
a
big
bold
american
barleywine
that
i
can
definitely
see
improving
with
age
though
its
just
fine
for
drinking
as
is
one
of
lagunitas
successes
on
tap
andys
corner
the
drink
is
silkysmooth
and
fullish
in
body
with
a
perfect
sizzle
of
carbonation
but
the
brew
is
still
quite
warm
and
boozy
and
would
surely
benefit
from
a
little
time
in
the
cellar
a
bomber
bottle
of
this
delicious
stuff
is
a
gracious
plenty
for
me
d
this
is
a
nice
barley
wine
if
you
like
the
american
versions
i
wish
i
could
get
this
in
ky
it
makes
a
nice
change
from
bigfoot
recommended
perhaps
this
is
one
to
age
for
about
5
years
not
gonna
buy
another
one
to
even
try
d
great
flavors
in
this
one
but
they
dont
blend
very
well
at
all
kind
of
a
trainwreck
at
the
moment
ive
had
some
better
variations
on
this
flavor
profile
including
the
north
coast
old
stock
and
pelican
stormwatcher

a
strong
red

go
down

at

in

fl
this
review
is
for
the
2008
vintage
which
was
about
15
months
old
at
the
time
of
consumption
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
fantastic
there
is
a
lot
of
sweet
malt
caramel
and
brown
sugar
in
the
malt
dominated
aroma
the
taste
like
the
aroma
has
mellowed
into
a
very
tasty
sweet
and
malty
treat
the
hops
have
faded
a
bit
and
the
malt
is
brought
into
the
spotlight
very
smooth
considering
the
strength
overall
this
is
fantastic
ontap
with
a
little
over
a
year
on
it
highly
recommended
d
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
barleywines
that
ive
encountered
high
abv
hardly
apparently
at
all
very
impressive
and
will
definitely
be
having
again
quite
easydrinking
if
you
like
bigger
bolder
beers
but
at
11
abv
it
is
one
to
be
aware
of
overall
superb
and
delicious
a
real
winner
drinkability
goes
down
great
this
is
a
delicious
brew
that
i
can
and
will
drink
again
d
overall
a
very
nice
beer
nice
flavor
complexity
and
good
balance
i
liked
how
the
brewers
achieved
generous
hop
flavors
without
imparting
a
heavy
bitterness
i
think
this
beer
would
be
good
candidate
for
cellaring
d
this
is
a
very
nice
barleywine
that
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
this
one
is
nearly
flawless
d
high
abv
and
gets
a
little
too
sweet
after
awhile
but
bonus
points
for
the
incredible
texture
and
ridiculously
low
retail
price
under
5
thats
almost
hoboworthy
a
bit
astringent
and
at
the
same
time
cloyingly
sweet
the
balance
is
off
and
the
plentiful
carbonation
doesnt
make
matters
any
better
unfortunately
it
does
improve
in
drinkability
as
it
warms
but
i
think
age
will
bring
this
big
brew
up
a
notch
or
two
overall
i
think
ill
cellar
at
least
one
for
a
year
in
better
hopes
d
a
bit
on
the
low
side
the
hops
have
really
ruined
this
brew
for
me
i
like
my
barleywines
on
the
sweeter
side
so
the
bitterness
doesnt
do
it
for
me
its
not
bad
just
not
what
im
looking
for
i
think
it
is
much
better
when
aged
than

apricot
tangerine
nondescript
citrus
as
well
and
some
background
raspy
hops
or
is
that
spiciness
from
the
alcohol
or
a
combination
with
the
citrus
edge
as
an
american
barley
wine
i
would
expect
more
hop
aroma
but
the
very
moderate
amount
thats
there
is
ok
mediumfull
in
body
or
should
that
be
fullmedium
decidedly
dextrinous
and
creamy
with
a
very
finebubbled
moderate
carbonation
thank
goodness
as
too
many
barley
wines
are
overcarbed
these
days
thinning
the
malt
and
amping
up
the
perceived
bitterness
with
carbonic
acid
this
softer
carbonation
works
really
well
to
accentuate
the
malt
and
malt
is
what
its
about
here
although
there
are
more
hops
in
the
flavor
and
some
clear
alcohol
which
seems
to
be
the
only
fault
with
some
higher
alcohols
rich
with
a
combination
of
golden
and
darker
caramel
notes
that
make
me
think
of
the
color
red
not
that
red
is
a
flavor
but
thats
how
i
perceive
it
i
guess
meaning
that
its
a
midway
point
between
the
golden
and
the
dark
the
malt
is
the
main
component
but
its
malt
thats
threaded
through
with
hop
flavor
dank
slightly
resinous
and
citrusy
clementine
lemon
zest
almost
berrylike
in
a
way
perhaps
simcoe
but
again
as
an
american
barley
wine
it
still
seems
a
little
light
the
balance
however
is
quite
good
and
overall
it
shines
given
the
price
of
8
9922
oz
bottle
and
i
know
you
can
find
it
cheaper
its
hard
to
argue
against
o
pretty
solid
for
a
young
barleywine
i
snagged
a
second
bottle
so
well
see
how
this
does
after
a
year
it
is
nowhere
near
as
abrasive
as
fresh
old
guardian
so
this
is
pleasant
to
drink
fresh
alcohol
could
be
masked
better
but
other
than
that
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
d
this
was
more
english
than
american
but
still
had
a
really
nice
scent
and
taste
the
body
was
solid
but
the
finish
was
a
little
harsh
so
it
was
better
to
sip
would
likely
age
well
fresh
is
good
not
great
o
this
is
a
nice
barleywine
the
18
months
has
mellowed
the
alcohol
somewhat
but
it
still
present
while
not
world
class
still
very
nice
overall
world
class

would
win
most

tastings

i
actually
kinda
like
the
booziness

i
could

others
would
be
turned
off
i
do
think
this
has
the
potential
to
develop
nicely
with
some
time
in
the
cellar
4
overall
its
a
good
beer
particularly
as
it
warms
it
never
comes
across
as
overly
bitter
until
youve
swallowed
and
the
pucker
never
leaves
your
palate
alcohol
is
well
moderated
providing
just
a
touch
of
taste
and
a
slight
burn
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
classic
barleywine
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
overall
certainly
one
of
the
more
unique
barleywines
ive
had
though
far
from
the
best
high
focus
on
the
hop
profile
while
the
malts
seem
fairly
generic
and
simple
so
questionable
as
to
how
this
one
might
age
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
was

wouldnt

it

of
an
evening
really
quite
a
looker
a
ruby
red
brown
admixture
with
a
wellformed
mocha
colored
head
and
a
rather
appealing
aroma
of
welltoasted
malts
almost
reminds
one
of
burnt
popcorn
strong
hazelnut
raisins
apples
pears
and
some
grapefruit
tangerine
and
faint
pine
from
the
bold
hop
regime
all
the
expected
elements
are
there
and
wellintegrated
some
folks
have
described
this
as
hot
or
young
in
terms
of
the
alcohol
flavor
and
although
you
can
taste
the
booze
i
might
have
snagged
a
wellaged
example
as
this
aint
too
hot
at
all
but
see
below
the
alcohol
flavor
peeks
out
here
and
there
with
the
whole
package
bitter
and
resinous
plus
sweet
in
equal
measure
lots
of
orchard
fruit
butterscotch
nuts
golden
raisin
and
molasses
kiss
candy
with
an
astringent
tea
bag
note
that
comes
on
strong
late
ipalike
hopping
in
the
finish
which
veers
towards
the
harshly
medicinal
but
does
remain
rooted
in
dried
citrus
peel
and
pine
territory
standout
features
for
me
include
the
malt
complexity
nuttiness
classic
barleywine
orchard
fruit
elements
and
assertive
hop
flavors
if
theres
a
drawback
its
that
things
do
get
a
tad
harsh
late
into
a
bomber
which
is
probably
a
good
reason
to
share
this
sucker
with
some
appreciative
aficionados
still
a
welcome
introduction
to
this
new
to
alberta
contract
brewer
for
me
i
see
this
aging
well
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
solid
off
white
head
comes
off
a
little
hot
and
has
a
strong
american
bitterness
that
is
not
that
pleasant
at
the
moment
im
not
sure
why
i
can
stop
myself
from
ordering
barley
wines
on
tap
but
more
often
than
not
i
get
disappointed
compared
with
a
bottle
that
has
a
little
time
on
its
side
overall
it
will
probably
mellow
out
to
be
better
than
what
i
gave
it
but
right
now
the
alcohol
heat
and
that
sharp
bitterness
keep
me
negative
on
it
for
now
not
the
most
complex
bw
ive
had
but
well
worth
a
try
that
being
said
i
doubt
id
buy
another
to
age
with
its
13
price
tag
not
the
most
complex
of
barleywines
be
they
new
or
old
world
in
origin
or
style
but
that
doesnt
seem
to
be
the
aim
here
instead
what
we
get
is
an
alcoholic
paean
to
a
lets
say
complicated
malt
the
dipa
hop
schedule
that
loves
it
and
lip
service
paid
in
full
to
that
oldseeming
musty
difference
maker
a
slow
sipper
to
be
sure
as
duly
noted
already
but
once
past
that
simple
physical
limitation
all
bets
are
off
o
not
a
bad
barleywine
taste
isnt
as
complex
or
deep
as
the
really
good
barleywines
its
worth
drinking
again
but
isnt
something
that
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
and
get
prost
the
flavor
is
of
sweet
barley
malts
lighter
hops
and
really
no
booze
at
all
i
like
my
barleywines
to
mellow
out
a
little
before
trying
them
and
this
one
did
22
ounce
bottle
bottled
on
050914
served
in
a
dfh
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
brownruby
red
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
that
stayed
around
a
while
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
caramel
toffee
dark
fruit
bready
malt
and
some
citrus
peel
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
caramel
toffee
candied
oranges
bready
malt
dark
fruit
and
some
citrusy
and
pine
hops
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
syrupy
and
has
moderate
carbonation
and
for
the
most
part
the
11
abv
is
well
hidden
i
thought
this
was
good
i
wouldnt
mind
buying
this
again
in
the
future
as
a
side
note
im
not
sure
if
this
is
the
base
beer
for
billionaire
but
it
would
taste
great
barrel
aged
time
slow
oxidation
and
wood
can
only
do
good
to
a
big
flavorful
beer
like
this
poured
a
ruby
red
body
with
brownish
tints
and
minor
head
and
lace
i
pick
up
figs
booze
bourbon
wood
caramel
toffee
and
other
sweet
malts
in
the
aroma
along
with
hints
of
dark
fruits
the
body
is
thick
smooth
the
booze
does
come
out
as
there
is
a
little
heat
malts
are
centerpiece
as
the
sweetness
from
caramel
and
toffee
maybe
figs
is
prevalent
but
a
good
bit
of
balance
from
dry
citric
hops
gives
this
beer
a
varied
taste
profile
maybe
not
a
barleywine
for
everyone
with
extra
hops
and
alcohol
dialed
back
for
style
but
its
pretty
good
but
still
in
the
end
there
was
something
i
just
did
not
like
its
not
been
with
just
one
clown
shoes
but
most
of
those
i
have
tasted
o
a
nice
american
barleywine
that
is
good
to
sip
on
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
as
its
barely
detectable
under
all
the
maltiness
pretty
good
pricepoint
as
well
relatively
speaking
at
8
49
certainly
worth
a
try
medium
to
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
has
a
citrus
and
caramel
malt
aftertaste
easy
to
drink
and
worth
trying
for
sure
nice
raisin
candied
yam
and
how
i
dont
know
you
may
think
this
is
crazy
but
ice
cream
maybe
its
because
its
hot
outside
anyway
very
malty
caramels
and
toffee
raisin
prune
blackberry
plumyes
prunes
are
dried
plums
but
the
flavors
are
different
and
somewhat
syruppy
now
not
the
maple
but
if
youve
ever
made
syrup
at
home
and
tasted
before
adding
any
flavorings
yeah
that
mild
hops
on
the
finish
bigger
bodied
and
very
representative
of
the
style
this
is
a
straight
forward
and
very
solid
example
of
the
style
well
crafted
it
becomes
redundant
at
times
i
almost
want
to
say
it
eventutally
becomes
a
chore
to
drink
but
thats
simply
not
the
case
good
stuff
but
nothing
mind
blowing
ive
never
been
all
that
huge
on
american
barleywines
and
this
beer
isnt
exactly
changing
my
mind
its
not
bad
but
its
not
quite
blowing
me
away
looking
at
this
beer
objectively
it
really
does
hit
everything
it
ought
to
for
the
style
though
its
got
a
very
nice
malt
profile
its
generously
hopped
while
not
being
insanely
bitter
and
the
alcohols
likely
deliberately
not
hidden
all
that
well
its
hard
not
to
appreciate
this
beer
pretty
dangerously
drinkable
i
recommend
it
22oz
bottle
with
a
bottled
on
date
of
051513
pours
a
murky
muddy
brown
color
with
very
little

fair
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
good
deal
of
dark
fruits
earth
caramel
and
toffee
the
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
malty
at
first
with
raisins
caramel
earth
brown
sugar
and
toffee
boozey
with
a
hint
of
orange
peel
finishes
with
some
more

woody
pretty
noticeable
alcohol
presence
that
may
have
mellowed
since
the
year
it
was
released
heavy
mouthfeel
slightly
sweet
overall
good
barleywine
that
i
would
buy
again
on
tap
at
acbf
this
was
a
really
tasty
barleywine
really
intense
tons
of
strong
boozy
fruit
balance
struck
me
as
really
interesting
and
quite
nice
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
a
very
tasty
barleywine
that
has
some
assertive
complex
boozy
fruits
plums
stonefruits
barrels
quite
nice
this
barleywine
pours
a
deep
rust
color
with
a
small
short
lived
off
white
head
that
gives
way
to
a
nice
film
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
subtle
blend
of
sweet
malts
west
coast
hops
and
booze
body
is
quite
close
to
full
with
a
very
pleasant
sticky
coating
texture
and
little
carbonation
the
flavor
is
not
as
subtle
as
the
nose
with
an
abundance
of
sweet
malt
woody
notes
dry
herby
hops
and
alcohol
there
is
also
a
little
toffeecaramel
flavor
for
good
measure
this
is
a
solid
barleywine
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
ages
this
nearly
fullbodied
lightly
effervesced
brew
is
smooth
slightly
drying
and
takes
on
a
warming

fairly
early
even
before

the

is
a

subpar
here
being
a

thin

prickly
perhaps
but
the

was
solid
and
lead
to
an
enjoyable

good
sweet

with
a
nice

bringing
a
lot
of
character
to
the
beer
good
looking
brew
too
all
in
all
this
is
another
solid
clown
shoes
beer
thats
well
worth
checking
out
if
you
get
the
chance
cheers
overall
a
decent
barleywine
and
not
really
boozey
o
its
described
as
an
american
barleywine
but
it
has
the
malt
forward
make
up
of
an
english
barleywine
which
i
greatly
prefer
dont
expect
a
hop
forward
barleywine
and
youll
be
rewarded
with
a
real
winner
overall
its
not
the
most
deft
diverse
or
complex
barleywine
around
still
it
holds
its
own
giving
one
their
daily
recommended
allowance
of
citrus
sweetness
and
alcohol
poured
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
not
sure
of
the
bottle
date
pours
a
amber
brown
with
a
two
inch
off
white
head
that
leaves
behind
excellent
lace
with
solid
retention
smell
is
loads
if
biscuity
grains
hard
candy
roasted
toffee
brown
sugar
grapefruit
and
some
alcohol
taste
starts
with
toffee
brown
sugar
and
biscuit
and
finishes
with
hard
candy
alcohol
and
grapefruit
the
body
is
medium
large
nice
amount
of
life
a
little
dry
and
drinks
way
to
easy
for
its
11
abv
i
like
big
hoppy
barleywines
and
that
is
this
fans
of
smuttynose
old
ruffian
old
guardian
and
big
foot
will
like
this
tasty
brew
overall
a
great
barleywine
and
one
thats
easy
to
enjoy
i
could
drink
plenty
of
these
especially
as
it
was
fairly
cheap
overall
this
barleywine
has
some
good
things
going
for
it
but
overall
it
comes
off
as
a
fairly
weak
flavored
brew
falling
in
as
a
middle
of
the
road
barleywine
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
and
probably
pretty
good
for
the
style
this
one
is
definitely
one
of
those
beers
that
takes
over
an
hour
to
drink
due
to
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
i
can
already
feel
the
hangover
from
this
one
not
a
fan
this
one
definitely
needs
more
time
very
raw
tasting
atmosphere
is
really
nice
slight
head
and
no
real
lacing
but
nose
prominently
features
raisin
and
butterscotch
bitter
and
a
little
sweetness
to
balance
pungent
components
as
well
boozy
thick
with
a
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
maybe
clown
shoes
should
bottle
date
their
bottles
so
i
would
not
give
their
beer
mediocre
scores
would
be
an
interesting
experiment
to
see
if
the
alcohol
heat
mellows
out
with
time
overall
a
good
fairly
mild
flavored
barleywine
o
great
bw
love
the
citra
its
dank
and
brooding
but
also
sweet
and
creamy
clown
shoes
first
barleywine
is
darn
good
theres
a
nice
balance
of
hop
presence
and
malty
goodness
i
may
have
to
procure
another
to
revisit
in
a
couple
years
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
very
nice
example
of
an
american
barleywine
it
had
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
and
i
thought
the
citra
hops
were
a
nice
touch
and
they
worked
well
with
this
beer
i
even
think
more
citra
hops
would
make
this
beer
even
better
but
it
may
make
it
more
dipa
like
and
as
it
stands
now
its
pretty
easy
to
tell
this
is
an
american
barleywine
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
especially
for
the
style
the
11
didnt
show
up
as
much
as
i
expected
and
even
with
the
higher
bitterness
it
still
remained
pretty
drinkable
and
i
think
a
bomber
to
myself
would
be
a
good
amount
and
i
cant
say
that
about
a
lot
of
american
barleywines
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
how
true
to
style
it
was
this
is
a
pretty
nice
example
of
what
an
american
barleywine
is
all
about
and
i
thought
the
drinkability
was
pretty
good
too
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
wasnt
bad
and
it
was
pretty
true
to
style
but
it
was
just
a
little
too
sticky
for
me
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
since
its
a
little
heavy
on
the
hops
i
dont
think
this
would
be
the
type
of
beer
i
would
cellar
but
if
i
could
find
it
fairly
fresh
and
was
in
the
mood
for
the
style
im
pretty
sure
i
would
get
it
but
it
is
a
little
pricey
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
hoppier
barleywines
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
i
was
on
the
fence
about
this
brewery
but
the
more
of
their
big
bottles
i
try
the
more
i
start
to
like
this
them
they
had
a
good
idea
to
add
citra
hops
to
barleywine
while
keeping
it
recognizable
as
a
barleywine
and
not
a
dipa
good
job
guys
ill
have
to
be
on
the
look
out
for
more
of
your
big
bottles
to
try
overall
not
bad
not
sure
how
it
would
age
but
not
bad
as
a
basic
barleywine
but
doesnt
do
much
to
stand
out
or
anything
like
that
bought
this
beer
because
of
the
label
awesome
pours
a
hazy
brownishred
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
goes
down
quickly
scent
is
hoppy
at
first
the
presence
of
citra
hops
is
definitely
noticeable
lots
of
hops
followed
by
burnt
sugar
lots
of
citrus
and
orange
peel
aromas
sweet
malt
and
more
hops
taste
is
sweet
malt
up
front
with
a
heavy
hop
profile
followed
closely
behind
quite
hoppy
definitely
an
american
barleywine
bitter
hops
with
a
bit
of
booze
and
some
burnt
malt
and
sugar
some
dark
fruits
as
well
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
yet
crisp
not
too
syrupy
drinkability
is
high
overall
i
feel
this
is
a
solid
representation
of
an
american
barleywine
not
bad
citra
hops
come
through
but
still
dominated
by
the
malt
flavors
o
decent
hoppy
barleywine
hoppiness
isnt
overpowering
due
to
the
strength
of
the
huge
caramel
malt
base
pretty
simple
overall
lots
of
caramel
and
citra
not
to
say
that
its
bad
at
all
big
bold
and
heavy
flavors
good
booziness
thats
not
overpowering
just
adds
more
kick
to
the
flavors
i
enjoyed
it
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
and
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
brown
sugar
and
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
a
nice
example
of
a
citrus
hop
forward
barleywine
overall
enjoying
this
not
a
standout
imo
but
nicely
done
either
way
you
get
what
you
pay
for
overall
a
nice
offering
from
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
admittedly
im
a
little
let
down
by
this
because
i
love
clown
shoes
and
i
love
barleywines
but
worth
trying
if
you
can
find
it
i
will
try
this
again
after
some
aging
but
i
worry
because
its
already
very
sweet
o
this
is
a
damn
fine
barleywine
clown
shoes
amazes
me
again
with
this
one
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
at
11
and
very
little
alcohol
warmth
this
is
defenately
a
brew
i
would
buy
again
i
do
have
a
2nd
i
am
keeping
in
my
beer
fridge
to
age
for
a
while
cheers
high
b
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
barley
wines
ive
had
although
ive
not
had
many
and
dont
consider
myself
an
expert
on
this
style
but
this
one
stands
up
to
stones
old
guardian
just
not
as
hoppy
odstarts
off
smelling
like
a
dipa
then
it
ends
up
showing
its
barelywine
roots
but
be
warned
crunkle
sam
is
still
a
hoppy
beast
of
a
beer
quite
cool
one
of
clown
shoes
better
hoppy
offerings
dark
orange
hue
with
minimal
white
head
smell
was
very
intense
and
very
good
rich
mango
and
pineapple
followed
by
bitter
hops
and
ending
with
sweet
malt
this
tasted
very
much
like
an
iipa
but
i
feel
like
a
lot
of
extremely
fresh
american
barley
wines
taste
this
way
notes
of
citrus
pine
vanilla
and
very
hoppy
as
it
warmed
the
barley
wine
character
came
though
as
the
sweet
malt
started
to
balance
with
the
hops
i
really
enjoyed
the
progression
of
this
beer
over
time
and
would
like
to
see
how
it
does
with
some
age
as
the
hops
will
die
down
considerably
theres
definitely
some
blurry
lines
between
this
and
an
imperial
ipa
but
while
nice
and
hoppy
still
has
a
distinguishable
american
barleywine
feel
and
its
good
i
dont
often
drink
barleywines
ive
had
only
610
different
selections
since
i
have
gotten
into
craft
beer
in
2003
the
best
compliment
i
can
give
this
brew
is
that
it
has
reinvigorated
my
interest
in
the
style
and
bolstered
my
love
of
big
beer
ultimately
the
latest
from
clown
shoes
defies
preconceived
notions
of
barleywines
displaying
a
very
complex
libation
that
is
literally
a
journey
though
potent
beer
sensations
very
true
to
clown
shoes
style
in
general
this
is
expertly
formulated
and
the
antithesis
of
boring
you
need
this
beer
in
your
life
drink
it
fresh
evil
twin

neither
hoppy
nor

not
enough
going
on
here
my
first
barley
wine
not
bad
but
not
sure
this
is
my
style
overall
impression
a
big
and
boozy
american
barleywine
i
could
have
used
some
filtering
or
lagering
to
get
rid
of
the
floaties
also
some
age
could
have
relieved
some
of
the
etoh
hotness
i
decent
shot
but
for
the
price
ill
stick
to
the
american
standards
i
e
bigfoot
overall
even
with
a
year
age
the
hops
are
still
very
noticeable
tale
of
two
beers
up
front
there
is
a
huge
sweetness
fruitiness
but
midway
through
the
beer
transitions
into
a
hop
bitterness
and
dry
oaky
port
like
finish
rather
enjoyable
to
see
the
beer
transform
like
that
with
every
sip
a
unique
type
of
balance
in
that
there

wine
not

not
as
complex
as

like
from

a
clear
dark
chocolaty

the

means
it
is
not

that
is
has
rather
subdued
notes
of
caramel

woody
hops
plus
a
hint
of
honey
syrupy
texture
is
smooth
and
does
not
seem
to
have
a

of
fizz
if
you
like
barleywines
this
may
be
up
your
alley
a
bit
more
alcoholic
tasting
than
i
would
have
preferred
bought
as
a
sgl
bottle
at
a
price
i
do
not
recall
although
i
believe
it
was
more
than
i
would
normally
pay
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
overall
excellent
what
a
barley
wine
should
be
note
to
self
wife
loves
this
its
continually
crisp
and
gets
smoother
as
it
goes
even
with
the
alcoholic
sting
theres
quite
a
bit
of
dryness
that
shows
the
body
leans
toward
full
without
ever
quite
leaving
medium
range
and
it
keeps
a
certain
depth
all
the
way
through
overall
good
brew
worth
grabbing
a
bottle
but
theres
definitely
much
better
options
out
there
salud
overall
reasonably
good
but
both
the
malt
and
hop
bills
lack
the
complexity
to
make
this
a
top
representative
of
the
american
barleywine
style
flavours
include
golden

booze
and
sultanas

harsh
and
somewhat
overly
sweet

slight

well

grade
a
beer
not
a
lot
of
typical

characteristics
floating
around
this
one
even
for
the
american
style
as
this
is
all
about
the
bitter
and
acrid
the
musty
and
malty
very
much
less
so
interesting
to
try
and
ultimately
not
that
difficult

a
very
enjoyable
offering
went
to
my
fridge
wanting
something
big
and
boozy
and
this
ticks
the
boxes
so
it
pours
a
full
dark
copper
red
hue
with
a
one
finger
head
and
a
rim
of
lacing
the
smell
is
definately
a
hoppy
barleywine
with
aromas
of
piney
resinous
hops
sweet
barley
and
booze
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
the
tastes
are
piney
hops
mixed
with
sweet
toffee
caramelized
pears
and
finished
with
a
fruity
boozy
bitterness
and
overall
a
nice
hoppy
barleywine
thats
worth
a
shot
cheers
ill
admit
it
becomes
more
enjoyable
the
more
you
drink
it
but
the
heat
really
diminishes
the
flavors
and
just
dominates
the
alcohol
isnt
hidden
at
all
but
maybe
that
was
their
intention
this
drinks
like
its
much
bigger
than
10

definite
sipper
this
was
a
beer
that
each
time
i
took
another
sip
i
dropped
by
score
can
see
no
reason
to
visit
this
again
any
time
soon
especially
given
the
price
the
beer
isnt
awful
but
ill
be
damned
if
i
can
ever
imagine
getting
this
over
a
glass
of
sn
bigfoot
which
is
twice
the
beer
this
is
at
half
the
price
im
sure
ive
never
had
anything
like
this
big
brutal
hoppy
integrated
as
well
as
a

a
very

beer
thats
close

maltiness
obliterated
by
a
solid
shot
of
earthy
pine

the
flavor
is

and
a
bit
gritty
with
a
solid
earthy
pine
offset
with
lots
of
sweet
caramel
fruit
and
brown
sugar
with
just
touches
of
chocolate
medium
to
thick
body
with
alight
to
moderate
level
of
carbonation
nice
barleywine
but
seems
like
it
needs
a
bit
of
time
for
the
flavors
to
meld
a
little
better
my
initial
impression
is
of
a
porter
with
a
shot
of
cognac
added
plenty
of
darker
deeply
roasted
malts
followed
by
a
solid
dollop
of
hop
bitterness
the
swallow
brings
out
a
strong
alcohol
warming
feel
the
aftertaste
is
like
a
bitter
alcoholic
cocktail
average
body
with
an
elevated
level
of
carbonation
i
would
drink
this
one
again
good
take
on
an
american
barleywine
its
a
sipper
honestly
even
though
i
dont
taste
or
so
much
feel
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
it
drinks
like
its
15
just
because
of
how
it
tastes
and
feels
freudian
slip
is
a
very
good
beer
and
quite
good
for
the
style
but
its
a
let
down
just
because
i
expect
everything
i
have
from
evil
twin
now
to
be
world
class
maybe
thats
my
fault
but
the
price
is
a
bit
high
id
recommend
it
if
you
like
super
bold
beers
andor
american
barleywines
overall
this
barleywine
is
a
bit
onedimensional
but
its
drinkable
and
relatively
tasty

the

guys
but
lets
keep
the
original
recipe
ok
adam
from

those
vibrant
fruit
notes
are
also
in
the
taste
but
the
malts
carry
themselves
forward
as
well
still
no
boozy
taste
but
the
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
is
pungent
and
lingering
not
something
i
got
on
the
nose
but
a
satisfying
conclusion
not
bad
but
i
prefer
a
hoppier
barley
wine
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
partial

on

small
dots

is
of

brown

citrus

alcohol
and
slight

onion
and
garlic
hop

taste
is
much
the
same
with
toasted

brown
sugar
and
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
and
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
mild
vegetal
hop
quality
in
the
aroma
that
disappears
as
the
beer
warms
up
o
pretty
nice
drinking
beer
hoppy
sweet
full
bodied
im
a
novice
barleywine
drinker
but
this
is
pleasing
i
might
like
to
see
a
little
more
balance
but
overall
this
is
solid
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
love
how
hoppy
this
beer
is
id
definitely
drink
this
one
fresh
on
the
sweet
side
fairly
hot
as
well
a
decent
barley
wine
seems
as
much
an
english
barley
wine
as
an
american
good
but
too
expensive
to
buy
again
i
dont
generally
like
barleywines
but
this
one
is
worth
getting
well
balanced
malt
sweetness
with
a
little
dryness
from
the
hops
surprisingly
not
cloying
as
most
barleywines
are
theres
some
dark
fruit
in
there
but
nothing
overwhelming
just
a
nice
warming
beer
overall
to
sum
up
a
good
not
great
american
barley
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
interesting
take
on
a
barleywine
more
of
an
american
strong
dark
ale
insofar
as
the
two
are
distinct
from
one
another
but
nevertheless
i
liked
this
better
than
the
gentleman
i
shared
it
with
a
curious
nose
hoppy
and
spicy
like
a
winter
warmer
or
holiday
beer
with
some
clove
and
molasses
but
i
think
most
or
all
of
that
is
a
product
of
a
very
large
and
diverse
grain
bill
the
flavor
comes
on
in
waves
sweet
and
grainy
first
the
only
part
of
this
that
resembles
classic
barleywine
but
it
is
short
loved
moving
into
a
spice
palate
that
includes
cloves
allspice
and
even
something
a
little
more
funky
cardamom
or
cinnamon
maybe
tough
to
tell
because
the
hops
start
in
before
the
spice
fully
evolves
bitter
as
anything
on
the
finish
which
is
one
sense
is
nice
because
it
cuts
the
grain
sweetness
but
on
the
other
had
is
frustrating
because
it
exacerbates
and
exposes
the
prominent
alcohol
strength
of
this
ale
fizzy
carbonation
makes
it
feel
light
on
the
palate
especially
for
the
style
and
for
this
examples
particular
strength
i
like
its
tricking
drinkability
and
would
recommend
this
ale
for
the
lover
of
the
unconventional
nothing
like
the
barleywine
we
expected
but
an
enjoyable
beverage
nevertheless
overall
above
average
to
solid
good
beer
closer
to
good
that
doesnt
stray
too
far
from
the
typical
flavor
profile
for
an
american
barleywine
effective
but
certainly
not
innovative
worth
a
try
and
it
may
become
a
bargain
standard
for
you
if
you
like
straightforward
american
barleywines
freudian
slip
is
a
beast
of
a
beer
that
in
no
way
recedes
in
aggression
instead
it
heralds
utmost
quality
and
power
with
unabashed
apologies
and
i
couldt
be
happier
for
it

a

o
not
a
mindblowing
beer
somewhat
midgrade
its
nice
but
not
over
the
top
good
overall
i
thought
this
wasnt
really
a
noteworthy
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
very
average
barleywine
there
were
some
aspects
i
enjoyed
but
i
thought
the
sweetness
was
out
of
hand
and
that
really
showed
up
in
the
aroma
taste
and
even
the
mouthfeel
and
the
warmer
it
got
the
more
boozy
it
got
this
beer
didnt
have
good
drinkability
it
wasnt
that
smooth
it
was
cloying
the
alcohol
could
have
been
hidden
better
and
the
taste
didnt
do
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
splitting
this
bottle
with
someone
is
enough
for
me
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
whole
bottle
its
way
too
sweet
and
cloying
for
me
to
have
more
than
half
a
bottle
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
aroma
they
were
both
nice
with
the
head
and
lacing
looking
pretty
good
for
a
10
barleywine
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
they
werent
that
good
and
they
were
the
downfall
of
this
beer
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
i
wasnt
that
into
it
and
it
was
way
overpriced
i
bought
two
of
these
so
the
other
one
is
going
to
set
in
the
cellar
for
a
while
and
hopefully
it
improves
a
little
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
its
not
a
great
example
of
a
barleywine
all
in
all
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
beer
it
doesnt
have
all
the
qualitys
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
and
the
sweetness
was
just
too
out
of
hand
and
combined
with
the
other
flaws
it
made
this
beer
pretty
rough
around
the
edges
this
wasnt
a
good
first
impression
for
evil
twin
i
still
have
interest
in
them
but
ill
for
sure
think
twice
before
a
i
drop
over
10
on
a
bottle
better
luck
next
time
this
one
just
wasnt
for
me
2014
edit
so
i
aged
a
bottle
from
this
same
batch
and
it
aged
very
nicely
the
hops
died
down
and
it
let
more
of
those
great
malt
flavors
come
through
i
liked
this
one
more
aged
and
im
going
to
bump
up
the
score
from
my
original
3
11
this
one
is
a
pass
for
me
glad
i
got
to
try
it
without
buying
would
not
recommend
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
dark
citrus
fits
the
style
of
an
american
barleywine
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
alcohol
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
slight
dark
citrus
yeast
hint
of
biscuit
and
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
overall
good
appearance
aroma
complexity
and
good
body
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
toffee
brown
with
a
thick
light
brown
head
that
retreats
slowly
i
can
see
some
bubbles
rising
along
the
side
of
the
glass
plenty
of
lacing
is
left
along
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
of
the
beer
is
sweet
and
bready
with
a
touch
of
woodiness
dark
fruits
and
some
booze
the
taste
follows
the
nose
its
mildly
sweet
with
a
nice
bready
malt
backbone
i
get
the
dark
fruit
flavors
and
some
of
the
alcohol
in
the
flavor
i
also
get
some
of
those
woody
notes
with
some
back
end
bitterness
to
provide
some
balance
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
and
the
alcohol
warms
in
the
back
of
the
throat
this
is
an
excellent
beer
but
just
so
can
someone
help
me
finish
this
bottle
actually
o
decent
but
not
really
worth
a
second
go
way
too
hot
and
twodimensional
o
big
and
bold
hops
and
malts
just
like
a
barleywine
should
be
pretty
strong
in
the
alcohol
heat
though
recommended
you
try
this
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
d
nice
hoppy
american
barleywine
great
hop
profile
and
bitterness
and
good
overall
bitterness
o
overall
this
is
an
incredible
double
ipa
i
expect
a
bit
more
heat
from
alcohol
in
a
barley
wine
that
said
it
is
simply
fantastic
hop
heads
delight
appearance
is
tawny
with
minimal
clarity
and
almost
no
head
some
lacing
exists
smells
is
straight
up
grain
with
a
heavy
leaning
towards
the
sweet
side
of
things
molasses
grapes
and
grain
taste
is
more
of
the
sweet
malts
with
some
hops
to
balance
things
out
finish
is
not
super
sweet
definite
notes
of
maple
and
grapes
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
sweet
barleywine
that
could
use
some
more
hops
o
im
surprised
to
see
that
this
beer
is
a
collaboration
with
westbrook
but
stoked
not
being
the
biggest
evil
twin
fan
i
ordered
this
on
the
strength
of
westbrooks
name
alone
overall
i
was
impressed
but
not
blown
away
mouth
feel
is
really
nice
creamy
yet
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
great
barleywine
and
a
unique
one
at
that
it
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
for
the
style
on
the
edge
of
light
with
a
bit
watery
feel
exaggerated
by
the
light
carbonation
it
is
enjoyable
in
limited
amounts
the
nose
is
the
standout
feature
of
this
brew
i
am
usually
a
big
fan
of
cask
beer
but
i
think
this
experience
was
possibly
degraded
a
bit
by
it
this
poured
out
as
a
reddish
brown
color
there
wasnt
much
of
a
head
on
top
just
some
scattered
bubbles
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
sweet
malts
on
the
nose
as
well
as
some
hops
the
aromas
of
caramel
and
dark
fruits
are
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
light
amount
of
raisin
flavor
with
a
hoppy
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
watery
its
drinkable
but
not
overly
complex
overall
this
beer
wasnt
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
there
are
better
barley
wines
out
there
pours
a
murky
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
nose
is
lightly
fruity
but
quite
heavy
on
the
toffee
and
toasted
malt
a
bit
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
along
with
some
pine
hop
notes
and
a
bit
of
perfume
the
flavor
has
an
almost
woody
note
to
it
heavy
on
the
pine
hops
with
a
moderate
bitterness
lots
of
toffee
a
bit
of
toast
and
some
brown
sugar
a
bit
of
booze
and
perfume
too
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
amber
with
a
nice
one
finger
tan
head
that
had
good
retention
and
tons
of
lacing
looks
good
aroma
of
caramel
malt
and
light
citrus
and
pine
hops
flavor
has
sweet
malt
and
dark
fruit
to
start
slowly
changing
to
a
malty
nicely
hopped
finish
and
a
lingering
slightly
boozy
pine
and
citrus
hop
aftertaste
moderately
complex
and
a
very
nice
flavor
progression
medium
to
heavy
bodied
with
moderate
creaminess
the
high
abv
and
hops
make
a
bit
of
an
astringent
finish
but
overall
i
enjoyed
this
well
made
american
style
barleywine
if
i
can
find
a
reasonably
priced
second
bottle
i
would
age
one
for
a
few
years
to
calm
the
booziness
great
for
sipping
on
a
cold
evening
i
had
to
end
my
tastings
for
the
day
here
but
sometimes
thats
a
good
thing
will
definitely
seek
out
again
its
definitely
a
hot
barleywine
with
a
healthy
dose
of
hops
but
it
comes
together
really
well
another
winner
from
evil
twin
which
has
been
impressing
more
than
mikkeller
lately
o
this
is
a
good
sipping
beer
for
a
cold
winter
night
o
overall
good
not
great
pretty
one
dimensional
with
the
big
nutty
character
for
the
price
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
poured
a
reddish
borwn
with
decent
head
on
top
of
a
slightly
boozy
sweet
and
sugary
malt
along
wiith
touch
of
figs
and
some
breadiness
hopping
minimal
this
is
a
hearty
filling
beer
with
some
slight
stickiness
malt
heavy
there
is
some
caramel
and
sugary
sweetness
tad
syrupy
and
almost
evenly
balanced
with
a
touch
of
citrusy
hops
and
alcohol
unfortunately
the
alcohol
bleeds
through
not
only
for
a
slightly
too
strong
backbite
but
overall
just
kind
of
muddles
the
beer
enjoyable
sipper
but
not
a
great
beer
overall
this
is
a
unique
barleywine
fan
of
the
fact
that
the
residual
sweetness
does
not
play
the
main
part
in
this
beer
big
big
beer
slight
astringency
prevents
it
from
being
amazing
served
from
bottle
into
a
green
man
snifter
poured
a
murky
yellowish
brown
with
a
two
finger
khaki
colored
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
very
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
citrus
citrus
hop
caramel
caramel
hop
wood
and
subtle
vanilla
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
citrus
caramel
wood
alcohol
dark
chocolate
and
caramel
hop
it
had
a
heavy
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
a
fairly
good
brew
i
really
hate
to
say
it
but
this
one
was
a
little
too
boozy
on
the
flavor
for
my
liking
there
were
lots
of
things
going
in
this
one
but
the
booze
just
stole
the
show
really
unfortunate
that
was
the
case
still
not
bad
but
i
doubt
i
could
drink
a
full
750
ml
bottle
myself
o
the
hop
bitterness
seems
to
out
pace
the
alcohol
high
c
o
good
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
overall
this
wasnt
a
very
good
barleywine
at
all
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
another
very
nice
drinkable
and
full
of
sweet
flavor
nice
brew
to
call
it
a
night
o
very
good
a
bit
sweet
but
well
balanced
a
good
barleywine
would
recommend
2014
bottle
from
mikes
barleywine
tasting
thanks
for
the
opportunity
rich
sweet
fruit
and
caramel
sticky
syrupy
sweet
mouthfeel
hides
the
alcohol
content
extremely
well
with
just
a
wisp
on
the
nose
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
o
phenomenal
barleywine
its
much
different
than
king
henry
or
the
k13
which
remain
my
favourite
barleywines
but
its
almost
as
good
as
these
are
in
its
own
way
highly
recommend
i
may
have
had
a
bad
bottle
but
honestly
its
so
overly
sweet
its
almost
hard
to
enjoy
im
quite
surprised
this
had
a
perfect
100
and
is
so
high
in
the
top
250
sweet
and
delicious
my
kind
of
bwine
montrealbcr89
you
maniac
boozecamel
too
who
hooked
me
up
with
a
bottle
you
handsome
fellas
are
too
good
to
me
o
very
fruit
forward
barleywine
with
the
cognac
treatment
only
increasing
this
rather
than
providing
some
vanillaoak
which
is
notably
absent
to
cut
the
fruitiness
this
is
decidedly
a
step
down
from
sucaba
or
bourbon
abominable
deserves
its
reputation
best
barleywine
ive
had
overall
hands
down
one
of
the
best
strong
beers
ive
ever
had
and
also
one
of
the
best
beers
period
750ml
is
obviously
a
sharing
size
for
this
and
unfortunately
i
have
no
one
to
share
it
with
tonight
so
i
hope
by
opening
it
before
5
p
m
ive
given
myself
enough
time
to
savor
this
one
throughout
the
evening
it
really
is
that
good
batch
2
one
of
best
ba
bws
i
have
tasted
super
sweet
but
very
good
on
the
sweeter
side
of
the
style
but
wonderfully
complex
if
you
know
what
good
barleywine
is
you
will
appreciate
deal
with
the
devil
get
it
if
you
get
a
chance
c
at
over
30
i
had
to
think
twice
about
picking
this
up
after
tasting
ill
be
going
back
to
get
a
bottle
to
age
i
was
worried
this
one
would
be
too
sweet
but
the
barrels
really
mellow
it
out
the
cognac
addition
is
wonderful
with
the
weight
it
drinks
more
like
a
stout
than
a
barleywine
overall
an
exceptional
beer
this
is
neck
and
neck
with
bourbon
county
for
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
cognac
barrel
really
comes
through
maple
syrup
apple
pear
caramel
velvety
smooth
with
no
alcohol
burn
really
overrated
only
plus
is
hidden
alcohol
how
is
this
17
this
is
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
this
drinks
so
easy
and
is
incredibly
smooth
such
a
complex
beer
i
wish
i
had
lots
of
bottles
of
this
one
good
but
leon
has
ruined
all
other
barleywines
for
me
that
was
just
a
lot
better
overallthis
beer
is
unlike
i
have
ever
had
or
could
ever
have
imagines
if
you
get
the
chance
get
it
dont
even
think
just
get
it
simply
an
amazing
beer
outstanding
the
nose
on
this
is
ridiculous
there
is
so
much
going
on
i
was
a
little
drunk
to
take
notes
but
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
smelling
barleywines
ive
had
the
taste
put
it
over
the
top
fantastic
im
bummed
out
that
i
didnt
pick
up
a
bottle
when
it
hit
the
shelves
simply
not
the
beer
i
was
expecting
thin
looks
like
whatll
come
out
of
my
ass
tomorrow
and
smells
like
malted
white
chocolate
milk
balls
only
way
id
have
this
again
if
i
was
looking
to
tie
one
on
had
batch
1
and
batch
2
side
by
side
b15
b24

kinda
still
in
the
glass
huge
toffee
and
booze
aroma
tasted
like
a
toasted
marshmellow
in
a
toffee
cognac
syrupy
beautifully
integrated
and
well
hidden
booze
best
bw
ive
had
b1
shared
three
ways
o
really
good
bw
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
tasted
the
barrelaging
was
done
right
on
this
one
o
possibly
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
hits
on
all
cylinders
sweet
without
being
cloying
and
ridiculously
drinkable
for
such
a
high
abv
im
already
seeking
this
out
again
and
crossing
my
fingers
that
batch
2
turned
out
just
as
well
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownblack
and
looks
totally
viscous
and
flat
until
a
few
seconds
after
pouring
when
a
fleet
of
tiny
bubbles
escape
towards
the
beers
surface
and
briefly
hold
a
centimeter
of
tan
head
ive
never
seen
this
phenomenon
with
a
beer
before
the
nose
is
super
sweet
and
fruity
mainly
grape
notes
with
toffee
a
hint
of
tobacco
and
almost
no
alcohol
the
taste
is
incredibly
decadent
with
its
rich
malt
backbone
followed
by
some
oak
and
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
may
be
the
most
viscous
beer
ive
had
to
date
it
sits
like
a
cement
truck
of
barrel
and
malt
on
the
palate
and
has
minimal
carbonation
bitterness
or
alcohol
im
very
impressed
by
this
beer
it
very
well
may
be
my
favorite
ba
barleywine
and
is
totally
worth
the
money
overall
a
good
strong
and
powerful
beer
but
does
nothing
to
keep
its
booziness
down
flavors
are
good
but
just
short
of
cloying
maybe
this
one
need
some
time
to
mellow
but
as
of
now
i
would
give
it
a
pass
at
this
age
serving
type
bottle
this
beer
is
very
hard
to
put
into
words
a
pretty
impressive
creation
if
the
sweetness
was
just
toned
down
this
thing
would
just
be
out
of
this
world
overall
quite
possibly
the
most
expensive
over
rated
barley
wine
in
recent
history
sorry
gabe
and
jerimiah
this
one
should
have
not
left
the
brewery
incredibly
sweet
tasting
no
alcohol
heat
whatsover
top
notch
incredible
beer
its
name
and
wild
recipe
make
it
sound
like
an
overly
aggressive
beer
that
would
punch
you
in
the
gut
but
it
is
quite
the
opposite
very
well
crafted
and
full
of
interesting
and
delicious
flavor
nuances
o
wow
this
is
a
beast
of
a
beer
and
one
that
delivers
in
every
category
the
barrel
really
adds
some
nice
nuances
but
surprisingly
isnt
the
star
of
the
show
that
honor
goes
to
the
maltiness
and
flat
out
high
gravityplato
of
the
brew
very
much
worth
the
30
that
was
begrudgingly
at
the
time
not
so
much
now
spent
if
you
get
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
do
it
absolutely
remarkable
red
and
brown
fruit
complexity
with
a
luxurious
cognac
overlay
that
meshes
perfectly
a
sophisticated
and
delightfully
mouth
coating
marvel
that
is
unbelievably
smooth
and
mellow
for
its
17
3
abv
beautifully
balanced
from
start
to
finish
trade
heavily
for
this
one
or
dont
even
flinch
at
the
30
price
tag
its
well
worth
it
a
deal
with
the
devil
is
a
truly
special
brew
of
the
myriad
barrel
aged
english
barleywines
ive
tried
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
top
two
or
three
its
worth
the
money
more
than
worth
any
hype
and
a
truly
huntworthy
brew
i
really
hope
that
i
can
score
some
more
at
some
point
but
a
heartfelt
thanks
to
itracy63
for
the
surprise
mail
bomb
from
alaska
to
georgia
overall
definitely
a
sipper
quite
the
extreme
beer
experience
and
truly
worth
the
high
price
tag
easily
busts
into
the
upper
echelon
of
ba
barleywines
this
is
a
really
awesome
achievement
in
brewing
if
the
sweetness
was
toned
down
a
bit
and
some
of
the
residual
sugars
fermented
out
this
would
be
basically
perfect
as
it
is
its
near
perfect
though
drink
this
was
a
good
beer
bordered
on
great
with
time
i
think
its
a
bit
thick
and
chewy
with
a
bunch
going
on
i
saw
signs
of
greatness
in
it
i
will
admit
this
kicked
my
ass
i
can
drink
some
big
beers
but
i
needed
a
nap
well
done
gabe
sweet
fruity
with
a
subtle
hint
of
the
strength
of
the
abv
taste
becomes
more
complex
as
it
warms
price
point
seemed
a
bit
expensive
but
i
grabbed
it
anyway
im
glad
i
did
if
not
the
best
barley
wine
ive
ever
tried
it
is
certainly
the
best
ive
have
recently
cognac
aging
lends
layers
other
barrels
just
dont
totally
right
for
this
brew
this
is
the
best
beer
of
2014
what
i
want
an
american
barleywine
to
taste
like
this
here
is
a
special
little
barleywine
its
got
insane
intensity
of
flavors
and
incredibly
all
the
complexity
and
balance
necessary
to
harness
that
intensity
not
only
sweet
but
kinda
tangy
and
with
that
leathery
slightly
bitter
swagger
that
always
makes
an
ale
like
this
interesting
its
got
character
to
spare
dark
reddish
brown
caramel
dark
fruit
nose
taste
reminiscent
of
aged
utopias
raisin
caramel
cognac
abv
extremely
well
hidden
a
top
2
barleywine
for
me
thick
smooth
creamy
awesome
nice
complexity
a
bit
boozy
in
the
finish
o
this
is
an
excellent
treat
very
big
beer
bold
flavors
makes
this
one
worth
the
acclaim
im
happy
i
was
able
to
try
this
so
i
do
not
need
to
search
it
out
anchorage
brought
their
a
game
and
as
the
most
subtle
of
sips
latch
onto
the
taste
buds
its
finish
is
longlasting
deeply
saturating
and
luxurious
on
the
palate
as
each
decadent
sip
reaches
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
taste
buds
for
a
lasting
dessertlike
slumber
batch
2
bottle
not
quite
as
rich
and
viscous
but
still
darn
good
this
years
seemed
a
bit
more
one
note
than
before
with
less
coconut
and
brown
sugar
and
more
molasses
overall
this
was
really
really
good
its
definitely
a
sweet
beer
but
its
big
full
bodied
thick
flavorful
and
very
complex
in
the
flavor
profile
a
touch
more
bitterness
might
help
push
this
into
the
next
stratosphere
but
as
it
is
its
a
beauty
of
a
beer
and
well
worth
checking
out
if
you
can
would
love
to
see
a
bottle
of
this
with
5
years
on
it
and
am
very
much
looking
forward
to
the
next
batch
awesome
beer
night
dooper
cheers
o
take
any
other
17
beer
fresh
and
its
hot
but
this
tastes
like
its
been
cellared
five
years
in
the
bottle
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
ever
had
and
definitely
the
best
one
ive
had
fresh
really
delicious
and
amazing
mouthfeel
and
really
impressive
allaround
o
this
is
one
of
the
finest
barleywines
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
to
drink
i
couldnt
quite
pull
out
any
traces
of
the
cognac
barrels
but
i
am
sure
it
is
probably
hiding
in
there
somewhere
waiting
for
a
more
experienced
palate
be
careful
with
this
one
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
given
how
smooth
it
is
o
this
is
the
best
barley
wine
that
i
have
had
so
far
some
people
may
not
agree
but
i
love
the
sweetness
to
this
beer
and
i
think
it
is
perfect
for
masking
the
17
beast
i
may
have
to
seek
this
one
out
overall
just
an
otherworldly
beer
even
though
this
beer
is
listed
as
an
american
barleywine
the
barrelaging
has
definitely
taken
over
in
the
primary
characteristics
and
gives
it
a
very
english
feel
with
big
sweetness
and
lots
of
grain
i
wish
i
had
a
full
bottle
of
my
own
because
i
would
love
to
pour
this
into
a
brandy
snifter
and
sip
on
it
over
the
course
of
an
hour
or
two
and
with
the
low
carbonation
i
can
imagine
it
would
hold
up
pretty
well
over
a
couple
daysyou
could
possibly
even
decant
it
without
severely
impacting
the
overall
profile
of
the
beer
i
hope
against
hope
that
anchorage
produces
this
beer
again
and
that
i
can
actually
procure
some
for
myself
overall
this
is
serious
good
but
really
sweet
o
an
outstanding
beer
probably
the
only
batch
1
ill
have
felt
quite
lucky
to
enjoy
at
churchkey
this
is
a
sipper
and
a
sharer
but
this
beer
is
very
nice
highly
recommended
would
love
to
encounter
again
this
isnt
quite
perfect
storm
or
even
king
henry
but
it
certainly
belongs
in
the
conversation
of
top
barleywines
great
complexity
with
an
excellent
feel
to
tie
things
together
the
aroma
brings
the
cognac
front
and
center
additional
notes
of
toffee
oak
booze
leather
brown
sugar
fabulous
flavor
carrying
every
delectable
whiff
of
the
aroma
into
the
taste
rich
and
smooth
delicate
on
the
palate
with
a
gentle
silky
finish
17
3
abv
dangerously
drinkable
teeming
with
flavor
this
is
a
beer
to
sip
and
savor
a
top
notch
example
of
the
style
id
love
to
have
this
again
sometime
overall
yes
its
great
its
fantastic
but
the
best
of
the
best
probably
not
would
love
to
have
some
to
age
would
pull
out
port
qualities
that
would
make
it
even
more
interesting
boozy
for
sure
but
i
find
it
hides
it
better
than
most
bruery
booze
bombs
an
enormous
barleywine
type
here
aged
in
cognac
an
i
thought
between
the
staves
was
cognac
heavy
ha
this
is
next
level
ultra
rich
and
decadent
and
intense
indian
brown
in
color
with
about
as
much
viscosity
as
ive
seen
in
a
beer
not
much
head
but
a
small
ring
of
tan
lace
along
the
edge
of
my
glass
it
smells
like
cognac
with
that
sweet
wine
property
tons
of
oak
and
an
enormous
grain
bill
that
must
assuredly
add
some
leftover
sugar
to
this
i
feel
the
beer
before
i
taste
it
what
an
incredible
texture
to
this
velvety
smooth
slippery
but
with
a
gigantic
body
hard
to
even
swallow
this
in
big
sips
its
so
heavy
up
there
with
the
heaviest
beers
ive
had
really
as
far
as
body
is
concerned
its
almost
not
fully
liquid
like
maple
syrup
or
something
burnt
sugar
and
vanilla
and
cognac
are
the
dominant
flavors
and
although
it
is
quite
sweet
i
dont
find
it
nasty
and
cloying
and
over
the
top
the
wood
mellows
it
all
out
i
am
amazed
at
just
how
smooth
this
beer
is
i
mean
for
17
abv
and
change
its
hardly
hot
in
the
slightest
and
certainly
doesnt
reek
of
big
booze
and
feel
like
a
fusel
bomb
certainly
a
bomber
of
this
would
light
up
even
the
most
seasoned
of
drinkers
but
is
a
beer
to
be
shared
anyhow
extremely
impressed
with
such
a
big
barleywine
and
would
take
this
over
the
likes
of
bourbon
county
and
others
the
texture
is
special
one
of
the
more
amusing
comments
i
heard
from
the
manager
at
bier
stein
dave
pertained
to
the
beers
drinkability
he
noted
that
you
really
couldnt
tell
this
was
a
17
abv
beer
that
it
really
drank
like
a
beer
with
only
12
abv
i
suppose
thats
true
but
12
or
17
this
is
a
sizeable
bw
with
some
serious
alcohol
to
it
overall
definitely
a
great
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
can
rank
it
as
high
as
most
have
this
is
partially
a
result
of
style
but
i
do
truly
think
that
it
isnt
as
good
as
abacus
a
must
try
especially
if
you
can
get
a
small
pour
o
when
i
walked
out
the
door
to
go
to
the
bar
and
try
this
beer
i
had
a
feeling
that
this
might
unseat
my
previously
favorite
beer
or
at
least
match
it
most
of
the
time
those
types
of
feelings
are
inaccurate
but
in
this
case
it
was
dead
on
this
beer
meets
the
hype
holy
shit
its
amazing
so
im
on
my
way
home
to
alaska
my
buddy
in
iowa
has
some
of
this
beer
he
made
over
a
year
ago
that
is
pretty
flipping
good
though
he
has
never
had
m
he
modeled
it
after
m
based
on
things
he
had
read
it
kinda
reminds
me
of
hebrew
jubilation
16
it
weighed
in
at
around
14
5
so
he
put
some
in
a
bottle
for
me
with
the
plan
that
i
would
go
see
gabe
at
anchorage
brewing
share
the
homebrew
with
him
and
maybe
get
some
feedback
and
tips
on
the
brew
that
all
came
to
pass
gabe
liked
it
said
i
dig
it
then
came
the
feedback
the
oak
and
bourbon
were
a
little
overdone
then
the
advice
next
time
oakbourbon
part
of
the
batch
and
not
the
other
part
then
blend
it
together
even
play
with
different
proportions
in
a
glass
before
blending
the
whole
batch
and
use
that
experience
to
guide
future
decisions
its
pretty
cool
that
gabe
took
the
time
to
do
this
and
show
me
around
again
hed
gotten
a
whole
bunch
more
huge
oak
fermenters
since
the
last
time
i
was
in
there
he
showed
me
the
last
pallet
of
dwtd
that
was
about
to
be
shipped
to
the
states
i
mentioned
that
i
missed
the
release
and
had
a
nice
vertical
of
bourbon
county
with
me
08
09
10
12
that
id
be
willing
to
trade
if
he
knew
anyone
that
had
any
he
found
me
a
bottle
and
we
commenced
the
deal
then
he
told
me
that
last
years
was
on
tap
at
humpys
and
hed
had
a
glass
with
his
lunch
i
made
a
bee
line
over
there
to
try
it
the
bottle
i
traded
for
will
go
back
to
iowa
and
be
shared
with
my
friend
who
sent
the
homebrew
attempt
at
m
good
story
and
the
good
news
is
that
he
is
making
exponentially
more
dwtd
next
year
i
forget
how
much
but
orders
of
magnitude
more
he
had
to
rent
another
building
to
hold
all
the
barrels
as
a
side
note
the
only
bummer
was
the
extreme
price
gauging
done
by
belmont
station
with
this
tasting
i
know
this
beer
is
expensive
but
10
for
a
45oz
pour
that
sucked
but
oh
well
admitted
this
was
the
last
beer
of
the
show
but
it
should
have
been
the
first
this
hands
down
is
the
best
barely
wine
i
have
ever
had
beautiful
dark
plum
flavor
balanced
by
richness
of
the
alcohol
makes
an
amazing
pairing
its
like
being
a
kid
again
and
looking
up
at
the
starry
sky
on
an
ink
black
night
and
relaizing
how
incredibly
complex
the
universe
is
you
dont
drink
this
beer
you
embrace
it
in
the
deepest
hug
you
can
and
hold
on
for
the
ride
o
fantastic
i
would
love
to
have
more
of
this
in
a
bigger
serving
to
accurately
judge
because
3oz
was
just
not
enough
had
on
tap
at
amsterdam
cafe
in
anchorage
just
heard
that
the
real
name
for
this
beer
is
a
deal
with
the
devil
the
name
is
fitting
i
have
no
reservations
saying
that
this
is
the
best
barley
wine
i
have
ever
had
hands
down
bar
none
not
even
close
this
beer
needs
to
be
bottled
i
cant
even
explain
in
words
how
indulgent
this
beer
is
mouthfeel
is
smooth
as
butter
as
smooth
as
any
oatmeal
stout
but
thicker
and
a
little
chewy
its
got
that
dark
ripe
ripe
fruit
and
malty
taste
of
a
barely
wine
but
just
more
dank
the
flavors
are
so
balanced
it
is
ridiculous
it
also
tastes
of
rich
toffee
caramel
malt
and
wood
a
little
more
boozy
as
it
warms
but
barely
my
mouth
and
lips
are
numb
from
all
the
alcohol
a
real
treat
i
didnt
get
to
try
this
at
the
alaska
beer
and
barleywine
fest
but
i
was
very
excited
when
i
saw
it
at
my
local
beer
warehouse
i
will
definitely
be
first
in
line
for
this
next
year
at
the
gabbf
thanks
for
making
this
amazing
beer
gabe
please
put
this
in
bottles
in
a
word
amazing
no
make
that
two
words
freakin
amazing
first
off
tasting
it
you
would
never
believe
that
it
is
north
of
17
alcohol
it
is
so
smooth
and
deep
that
i
would
have
guess
more
like
12
tops
it
is
incredibly
complex
with
a
balance
and
depth
of
flavor
profile
that
has
to
be
experienced
to
be
believed
i
first
tasted
it
the
day
before
the
great
alaska
beer
barley
wine
festival
and
i
immediately
knew
it
would
win
first
place
it
was
just
that
good
once
again
gabe
fletcher
has
pulled
off
a
brewing
masterpiece
a
deal
with
the
devil
indeed
im
starting
to
wonder
if
he
didnt
meet
a
certain
gentleman
at
the
crossroads
late
one
night
and
make
a
deal
for
the
power
to
brew
these
sort
of
beers
after
all
if
robert
johnson
could
do
it
to
learn
how
to
play
the
guitar
why
not
a
brewer
o
i
first
heard
about
this
beer
from
gabe
last
summer
it
was
brewed
for
the
ak
barleywine
fest
which
i
missed
i
was
very
happy
to
hear
that
this
was
still
on
very
good
and
i
am
thankful
that
i
got
a
shot
to
try
this
acidity
is
kicking
in
on
my
2014
bottle
the
tartness
somehow
works
with
the
pumpkin
and
brady
barrel
not
sure
if
this
an
infection
or
a
brewers
intention
but
it
works
a
strong
presence
of
pumpkin
spice
is
the
dominant
flavor
with
very
mild
brandy
barrel
doesnt
really
taste
much
like
a
barleywine
but
more
like
a
pumpkin
ale
also
this
must
be
the
mildest
12
beer
ive
ever
had
alcohol
is
not
perceivable
overall
this
has
a
nice
balance
and
mouth
feel
and
delivers
good
pumpkin
spice
flavor
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
as
a
couple
other
reviews
have
mentioned
my
bottle
was
pretty
sour
which
i
didnt
really
expect
still
tastes
decent
but
not
at
all
what
i
was
anticipating
mine
tastes
a
bit
like
a
tart
white
wine
with
pumpkin
pie
spices
slightly
sour
i
had
high
hopes
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
a
stodgylooking
orangebrown
brew
sudsy
and
viscous
yields
huge
wafts
of
grainy
sugars
and
holiday
spice
propelled
by
ample
alcohols
volatiles
it
tastes
as
it
should
pumpkiny
resiny
oaky
but
lactic
acid
and
a
prominent
hop
profile
give
this
brew
complexion
and
depth
its
contemporaries
often
lack
this
is
well
crafted
and
tasty
i
am
not
really
a
pumpkin
ale
man
so
this
one
was
my
cup
of
tea
decent
head
and
nice
lacing
no
carbonation
slight
sourness

the
barrel
is
far

overall
this
is

i
obviously
got
an

bottle
but
it
still
turned
out
very
tasty
with
balanced
malt
spice
and
barrel
flavors
with
the
tartfruity
yeast
notes
a
very
enjoyable
offering
even
with
the
infection
o
quite
a
different
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
and
its
outstanding
perhaps
we
need
more
pumpkin
barleywines
interesting
take
on
a
pumpkin
ale
lots
of
spice
and
pumpkin
flavor
slight
peppery
flavor
which
lessens
as
it
warms
leading
to
other
spices
definitely
a
complex
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
but
definitely
worth
trying

that
is
reminiscent
of
fresh
pumpkin

to
baked

a
pie
medium
bodied
without
the
expected
heaviness
of
a
barleywine
a
nicely
made
well
balanced
pumpkin

with
a
great
interplay
of
malt
and
pumpkin
and
light
but
distinct
pie
spicing
the
light
tartness
was
expected
from
this
brewery
that
excels
at
sours
and
seemed
to
be
more
a
yeast
flavor
than
rye
which
i
would
have
preferred
not
quite
to
my
taste
but
nicely
made
and
flavorful
as
anticipated
from
almanac
brandy
flavor
is
present
but
i
wouldnt
have
identified
without
prior
knowledge
interesting
and
festive
thanks
c64person
for
the

excellent

look
reminds
me
of

is
exceptional

also

overall
this
is
an
exceptional

very

really

pumpkin
brandy
vanilla
flavor
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
thin
abv
is
well
hidden
im
generally
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
beer
is
hands
down
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
ever
had
the
flavor
of
brandy
is
slight
mixes
very
well
with
the
vanilla
malts
roasty
pumpkin
flavors
the
nose
is
sweet
slightly
spicy
even
the
color
of
the
brew
is
a
perfect
light
copper
color
very
reminiscent
of
pumpkin
although
we
hit
double
digit
abv
with
this
one
the
alcohol
is
perfectly
hidden
very
drinkable
a
spooktacular
beer
this
is
really
interesting
but
didnt
quite
meet
the
hype
for
me
really
a
remarkable
creation
by
the
folks
at
farm
to
barrel
in
2013
this
was
one
of
my
two
most
favorite
pumpkin
beers
and
in
2014
its
at
the
top
of
the
charts
again
taste
was
similarly
complex
with
boozy
barrel
elements
upfront
sticky
toffee
and
vanilla
with
pumpkin
spices
of
nutmeg
and
clove
in
the
periphery
full
bodied
and
sticky
we
split
this
4
ways
and
that
was
enough
though
id
try
it
again
if
i
saw
it
unique
use
of
pumpkin
for
sure
beautiful
balance
of
pumpkin
pumpkin
spice
rye
barrel
and
brandy
barrel
all
the
ingredients
are
very
soft
and
natural
tasting
and
the
barrel
influence
is
paradoxically
very
present
and
yet
subtle
and
nuanced
unlike
even
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
enjoyed
this
one
is
blissfully
devoid
of
that
perfumy
overspiced
character
and
is
redolent
of
real
gourd
goodness
wow
boozy
on
the
nose
with
aromatics
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
oak
pumpkin
sweetness
beautiful
deep
orange
hues
with
good
lacing
when
poured
in
a
snifter
taste
i
am
hit
with
initial
sweetness
as
well
as
some
nice
spice
and
then
it
moves
into
the
warmth
and
brandy
notes
and
syrupy
mouthfeel
i
love
this
beer
i
found
almanac
at
gabf
and
was
very
lucky
to
snag
this
bottle
no
rye
detected
great
beer
for
a
12
barleywine
i
was
expecting
a
thick
dark
pumpkiny
brew
instead
i
got
a
light
tart
prethanksgiving
holiday
treat
its
possible
it
was
infected
because
im
not
sure
it
was
supposed
to
be
tart
but
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
anyway
appearance
was
standard
for
a
pumpkin
ale
a
deep
orange
with
a
light
fluffy
head
nose
had
that
slight
tartness
along
with
the
pumkin
and
spices
taste
had
all
the
holiday
spices
you
could
ask
for
the
tartness
was
definitely
there
adding
to
the
complexity
of
this
beer
i
couldnt
taste
the
12
at
all
like
at
all
at
all
mouth
was
medium
to
light
with
a
pleasant
amount
of
carbonation
this
was
a
masterpiece
accidental
or
not
serving
type
bottle
great
beer
i
get
a
little
scared
when
it
comes
to
fruit
or
vegetable
beers
i
am
not
a
fan
of
a
beer
with
a
overpowering
dominant
flavor
this
beer
pours
with
little
to
no
head
a
little
lighter
in
color
than
maple
syrup
very
light
in
carbonation
but
the
body
is
rich
lots
of
caramel
flavors
and
fruity
raisin
fig
this
beer
is
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
lots
of
different
caramel
flavors
come
out
some
oak
vanilla
and
whiskey
flavors
are
present
as
well
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
the
barrel
ageing
really
does
wonders
for
this
beer
very
pleasant
surprise
considering
its
not
even
the
beer
i
thought
i
had
bought
my
first
experience
with
combining
sour
tendencies
with
a
bw
and
while
its
not
a
perfect
fit
it
works
for
the
most
part
the
pumpkin
is
an
afterthought
and
the
brandyrye
aging
while
interesting
and
a
net
positive
may
be
a
little
superfluous
overall
first
piece
of
advice
let
it
warm
up
it
gets
better
and
better
as
it
closes
in
on
room
temperature
complex
taste
i
know
i
said
it
before
but
i
cant
emphasize
it
grab
a
glass
and
indulge
salud
most
pumpkin
beers
taste
like
pumpkin
pie
filling
while
almanacs
is
reminiscent
of
a
gourd
cut
open
straight
form
the
patch
as
delicate
and
bright
as
heirloom
pumpkin
is
im
not
sure
itll
unseat

as
my
preferred
pumpkin
ale
almanacs
beer
is
brighter
tarter
and
dewier
its
also
higher
in
abv
by
nearly
half
a
tasty
diversion
not
a
seasonal
staple
a
well
done
pumpkin
barleywine
with
impressive
pumpkin
pie
flavor
and
a
pleasantly
thick

it

probably
get

if
you
like
flavored
beers
this
is
a
great
example
the
spices
are
strong
and
fresh
matching
the
beer
very
well
like
most
spiced
beers
it
is
a
bit
overwhelmed
by
the
spices
however
there
are
still
some
interesting
flavors
going
on
while
tasting
like
a
big
glass
of
fall
bottle
from
beer
rev
in
oakland
pumpkin
spice
flavors
are
well
done
its
heavy
but
its
not
overly
think
or
syrupy
like
some
barleywines
can
get
body
and
carbonation
levels
are
spot
on
really
nice
recommended
subtle
pumpkin
flavor
but
none
of
the
spices
usually
associated
with
pumpkin
pie
the
pumking
just
lost
his
crown
tmo
spot
on
really
well
balanced
barrel
aged
pumpkin
the
fact
that
it
is
a
barleywine
is
not
lost
here
the
pumpkin
glazed
over
the
caramel
malt
and
then
aged
in
brandy
is
simply
the
recipe
to
happiness
i
dont
get
much
of
the
rye
but
here
is
definitely
wood
and
the
blend
is
like
a
softly
cinnamonized
pumpkin
sangria
definitely
check
it
out
butterscotch
o
a
finely
crafted
marriage
between
pumpkin
ale
and
american
barleywine
hops
are
dank
and
earthy
lots
of
wood
and
musk
clean
fresh
tasting
raw
pumpkin
flavors
are
elevated
through
spice
and
sugar
barrel
characteristics
come
forward
to
say
hello
and
then
slide
into
the
background
keeping
everything
a
little
lighter
tighter
and
airier
than
they
would
have
been
otherwise
epic
i
was
completely
surprised
by
this
offering
so
spectacularly
made
i
have
tried
many
pumpkin
beers
that
out
of
respect
to
the
makers
i
did
not
review
as
i
was
disappointed
greatly
this
is
the
first
pumpkin
beer
that
excited
me
enough
to
want
to
seek
out
to
have
more
i
intend
on
buying
and
cellaring
overall
a
fantastic
brew
well
worth
the
usual
almanac
price
for
this
different
experience
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
ever
had
highly
recommended
for
those
unable
to
get
good
gourd
almighty
i
will
edit
this
if
i
am
able
to
try
it
again
but
as
i
am
on
the
east
coast
that
is
not
likely
and
i
am
really
disappointed

bottle
smells
terrific
caramelized
pumpkin
dark
crusty
bread
brown
sugar
and
well
integrated
spices
cohesive
blend
of
spices
with
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
dried
ginger
the
most
noticeable
similar
elements
on
the
palate
along
with
flavors
from
the
brandy
and
rye
barrels
which
come
through
more
than
in
the
aroma
spicy
cigar
tobacco
nice
depth
and
complexity
sweet
but
not
overly
so
and
dries
out
in
the
finish
as
a
touch
of
bitterness
comes
in
lingering
old
liquor
barrels
tobacco
and
spice
quite
tasty
oh
my
this
is
delicious
a
good
deal
more
nuance
than
most
pumpkin
beers
and
much
less
sweetness
and
inyourface
buttery
or
sweet
pumpkin
flavor
than
pumking
or
schlaflys
pumpkin
beer
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
not
at
all
a
sipping
beer
despite
the
12
abv
i
agree
with
an
earlier
review
that
the
flavor
and
aroma
is
unique
just
outstanding
o
truly
complex
flavor
profile
in
this
beer
that
really
put
a
smile
on
my
face
all
i
will
say
is
if
you
are
a
lover
of
pumpkin
beers
give
this
one
a
try
o
this
is
an
amazing
pumpkin
beer
i
am
blessed
to
live
so
close
to
the
brewery
so
i
pick
up
several
bottles
for
the
fall
season
everything
goes
together
so
well
in
this
beer
i
highly
recommend
picking
up
or
trading
for
this
beer
cheers
overall
pumpkin
barleywine
such
an
epic
style
and
almanac
does
this
perfectly
the
beer
pours
a
gorgeous
dull
tarnished
copper
color
with
flecks
of
gold
when
held
to
the
light
its
topped
by
a
razor
thin
offwhite
head
that
settles
quickly
into
a
halo
around
the
perimeter
surprisingly
for
an
almanac
beer
there
is
no
sediment
the
nose
is
overwhelming
spices
and
brandy
upfront
mainly
clove
and
ginger
but
has
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
earthy
gourdyam
sweetness
as
well
though
there
is
a
slightly
booziness
in
the
nose
its
not
unpleasant
and
helps
amplify
the
beers
spice
profile
the
taste
has
the
same
brown
sugarpumpkin
pie
sweetness
upfront
which
transitions
quickly
into
a
boozy
caramelized
pumpkin
spice
bomb
for
the
finish
the
beer
has
a
rounded
sweet
full
body
cut
with
pungent
pie
spices
alcohol
and
adequate
carbonation
there
are
lingering
pie
spices
coat
the
palate
and
take
their
time
fading
this
is
an
absolutely
killer
combination
of
pumpkin
beer
and
barleywine
cant
wait
to
have
it
again
o
i
love
this
beer
exceptional
would
have
again
any
time
any
where
o
i
was
blown
away
by
this
one
probably
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
ages
further
o
there
is
a
lot
here
for
people
that
like
sours
and
belgians
more
belgian
than
sour
to
be
honest
but
i
am
unfortunately
not
a
fan
of
either
it
is
pretty
balanced
this
unfortunately
is
not
my
thing
but
i
can
tell
why
a
lot
of
people
would
like
it
so
i
didnt
too
harshly
dock
it
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
thin
head
and
significant
lacing
the
nose
is
heavy
on
brown
sugar
and
pumpkin
flesh
this
melds
well
with
the
rich
malty
barleywine
malt
bill
some
notes
of
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
spice
towards
the
end
this
has
a
much
more
earthy
and
less
spicey
aroma
than
your
typical
pumpkin
brew
the
taste
is
ridiculously
smooth
for
such
a
high
gravity
beer
copious
amounts
of
pumpkin
flesh
come
through
on
the
flavor
with
plenty
of
brown
sugar
along
with
it
the
brandy
barrel
comes
through
and
brings
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
caramel
through
while
mellowing
out
the
malts
the
barleywine
actually
seems
to
be
an
appropriate
base
for
the
pumpkin
treatment
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
low
on
carbonation
overall
another
winner
from
almanac
o
truly
an
outstanding
beer
this
beer
is
complex
smooth
and
all
the
flavors
work
so
well
together
almanac
may
be
one
of
the
best
breweries
that
most
people
havent
heard
of
a
nice
fall
time
beer
im
drinking
this
in
the
spring
so
maybe
im
not
appreciating
it
as
much
as
i
should
nice
though
o
overall
this
one
was
tough
i
really
dont
think
it
smelled
or
drank
like
a
barleywine
was
far
too
easy
drinking
for
the
abv
the
pumpkin
and
brandy
are
balanced
out
exquisitely
wish
i
had
another
bottle
o
pretty
drinkable
barleywine
the
12
abv
is
masked
nicely
with
the
sweetness
from
the
pumpkin
and
the
brandy
o
pumpkin
beers
are
usually
hit
or
miss
for
me
theres
a
lot
that
i
hate
mostly
because
they
are
overspiced
and
a
few
that
are
done
just
right
that
i
really
enjoy
while
this
beer
by
no
means
blew
me
away
it
was
well
done
for
what
it
is
it
was
nice
and
smooth
and
had
a
nice
balance
between
the
pumkin
yams
and
spices
the
brandy
played
a
little
bit
more
of
a
subtle
roll
then
i
would
have
liked
but
did
a
good
job
smoothing
everything
out
and
adding
an
additional
balance
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
for
everyone
but
its
definitely
an
interesting
try
especially
if
youre
into
pumpkin
beers
o
a
well
done
barleywine
that
would
trend
my
taste
buds
toward
barleywines
and
not
away
from
them
verdict
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
creative
and
innovative
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
the
brandy
barrel
works
wonderfully
and
the
spicing
is
executed
extremely
well
its
still
a
dominantly
sweet
beer
but
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
to
date
and
one
of
the
better
barrel
aged
barleywines
at
that
matter
this
pours
an
amber
grapefruit
color
it
glows
with
a
thin
layer
of
foam
i
get
a
distinct
pumpkin
aromaclearly
reminiscent
of
roasted
steamed
pumpkins
rather
than
any
sort
of
holiday
spicing
dominating
the
flavor
has
a
definitive
bitterness
with
pumpkin
and
pine
in
contrast
freakin
fantastic
as
a
barleywineand
as
a
pumpkin
beer
o
very
unique
and
well
executed
dont
see
many
okay
any
brandy
barrel
pumpkin
barleywines
surprisingly
well
executed
in
fact
brandy
is
sharp
to
begin
with
but
mellows
out
just
right
through
the
progression
of
flavors
not
a
spice
bomb
like
so
many
pumpkin
ales
good
combination
of
complexity
balance
and
uniqueness
a
musttry
d
this
is
a
really
nice
holiday
brew
nothing
mind
blowing
but
the
pumpkin
flavors
taste
fresh
and
i
especially
like
the
base
barleywine
which
is
loaded
with
caramel
and
nougat
o
great
and
different
mix
of
flavors
great
stuff
o
overall
a
really
cool
beer
a
good
barleywine
with
a
little
bit
of
a
twist
loads
of
good
caramel
and
toffee
the
pumpkin
is
nice
is
the
nose
and
lighter
in
the
taste
which
works
well
and
i
kind
of
prefer
worth
checking
out
would
love
to
have
it
again
owow
a
great
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
they
brandy
went
nicely
and
the
barleywine
base
was
a
great
touch
im
not
usually
a
pumpkin
beer
guy
and
a
lot
of
barleywines
are
too
cloying
for
me
with
that
said
this
beer
is
rich
but
not
overly
sweet
spicy
but
even
handed
complex
but
not
fatiguing
and
most
importantly
delicious
a
good
thanksgiving
treat
thanks
again
scott
o
im
not
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
but
i
had
this
on
my
must
try
list
and
it
did
not
disappoint
o
a
decent
but
not
exceptional
ba
pumpkin
beer
i
liked
rumpkin
substantially
more
both
in
terms
of
balance
and
flavor
o
great
offering
from
almanac
you
can
sense
the
care
taken
i
would
also
love
to
cellar
1
or
2
of
these
for
the
future
bottle
at
stone
beer
garden
pours
a
deep
clear
orange
with
barely
any
white
head
and
some
nice
lacing
aroma
of
massive
pumpkins
caramel
malts
and
some
nice
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
that
is
there
but
not
overpowering
the
aroma
flavor
is
sweet
up
front
big
pumpkin
flavors
caramel
malts
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
spice
on
the
finish
that
keeps
this
from
being
extremely
sweet
i
assume
the
sweetness
comes
from
the
brandy
barrels
really
nice
lingering
finish
of
vanilla
whipped
cream
almost
like
they
planned
it
this
way
like
a
spoonful
on
top
of
my
pumpkin
pie
slick
palate
but
surprisingly
light
bodied
low
to
medium
carbonation
this
is
as
unique
as
it
gets
and
pretty
amazing
m
full
body
light
carbonation
as
complex
as
a
pumpkin
beer
can
probably
be
blended
pumpkin
barleywine
and
spiced
ale
aged
in
brandy
barrels
its
incredible
runny
looking
orange
hued
copper
liquid
without
a
ton
of
head
but
a
lot
of
stature
patient
looking
and
confident
in
personality
a
nose
of
sweet
english
and
american
barley
malt
on
the
carameltoffee
spectrum
lots
of
fall
spice
musty
oak
black
pepper
alcohol
and
pumpkin
pie
notes
the
flavor
is
all
of
those
things
the
heat
and
silk
from
the
brandy
comes
through
definitely
an
after
dinner
type
of
beer
here
the
alcoholic
strength
is
intense
as
it
warms
up
but
it
stays
somehow
soft
and
mellow
in
feel
even
with
a
lot
of
body
spice
and
sweet
go
back
and
forth
on
the
finish
the
pumpkin
itself
is
in
the
background
throughout
never
really
dominating
but
always
contributing
a
sweet
squashy
flavor
without
much
carbonation
it
feels
almost
like
a
liqueur
and
it
drinks
a
lot
like
one
perfectly
appropriate
halloween
night
beer
like
no
other
clever
and
superbly
executed
i
need
to
try
more
from
these
guys
i
really
liked
that
fact
the
the
higher
alcohol
level
of
this
barleywine
doesnt
interfere
with
its
taste
or
aroma
well
done
and
very
drinkable
is
raul
feeling
this
yes
he
is
my
children
yes
he
is
o
pretty
solid
overall
the
spice
might
be
a
little
over
the
top
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
sweetspiced
pumpkin
beer
this
is
pretty
damn
good
pours
into
a
bulb
glass
a
deep
auburn
color
with
a
nicely
formed
slightly
off
white
head
atop
aromas
of
brandy
and
pumpkin
spice
with
alot
of
brown
sugar
and
alcoholstill
its
warming
and
inviting
brandy
alcohol
sweetness
and
brown
sugar
melds
into
real
pumpkin
and
pumpkin
spice
flavorsman
its
rich
tasting
and
a
real
sipping
flavorful
beer
you
can
tell
alot
of
care
and
time
went
into
this
beer
its
a
true
artisan
ale
and
thee
best
pumpkin
infused
beer
i
have
had
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
with
modest
carbonation
a
huge
sipper
that
caught
me
offguard
with
my
first
sip
enjoyable
and
complex
but
a
real
kick
in
the
pants
if
i
had
a
chance
at
another
bottle
of
this
i
would
probably
tuck
it
away
and
forget
anout
it
until
next
year
it
is
quite
boozy
but
rounded
enough
to
be
enjoyed
now
if
you
dont
mind
the
alcohol
burn
overall
good
but
not
amazing
mouthfeeloverall
body
on
this
beer
is
about
medium
maybe
slightly
less
carbonation
is
moderate
back
end
and
finish
is
a
bit
dry
which
seems
misplaced
all
in
all
mouthfeel
is
okay
though
overall
i
was
definitely
a
fan
of
this
beer
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
very
rich
flavors
and
no
glaring
weaknesses
make
an
effort
to
try
this
if
you
can
probably
the
best
pumpkin
beer
that
i
have
had
to
date
pours
a
lovely
copper
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
decent
lacing
brandy
hits
the
nose
front
and
center
followed
by
dark
fruit
molasses
and
faint
vanilla
notes
the
taste
is
amazing
raisins
roasted
pumpkin
malt
that
finishes
with
vanilla
and
brandy
layered
and
complex
some
alcohol
warming
finishes
sweet
and
boozy
creamy
mouthfeel
with
light
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
dessert
in
a
glass
extremely
well
crafted
its
the
perfect
accompaniment
to
a
cool
autumn
evening
big
thanks
to
millerbuffoon
for
saving
and
sharing
this
one
with
me
this
poured
out
as
a
brownish
amber
color
with
some
highlights
of
gold
there
was
a
cream
colored
head
that
forms
on
top
it
slowly
drops
and
leaves
a
nice
coating
over
the
beer
there
is
a
scattered
lacing
on
the
glass
as
well
which
is
very
nice
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
earthy
its
got
a
good
amount
of
spice
to
it
with
plenty
of
booze
too
the
flavors
is
awesome
the
flavors
at
first
arent
much
to
rave
about
but
they
really
come
out
as
the
beer
settles
on
the
taste
buds
this
is
loaded
with
sweet
malt
and
earthy
pumpkin
followed
up
by
some
of
the
best
spice
balance
ive
ever
tasted
in
a
pumpkin
style
beer
the
brandy
barrel
aging
isnt
dominant
at
all
but
probably
adds
to
the
flavors
in
some
way
incredible
flavors
though
hard
to
describe
perfection
but
i
think
this
has
it
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
medium
to
heavy
its
got
plenty
of
body
for
the
style
and
a
very
nice
carbonation
overall
this
was
excellent
as
a
pumpkin
barleywine
and
that
is
primarily
how
im
looking
at
this
its
more
than
just
an
american
barleywine
to
me
this
is
something
everyone
should
try
i
will
be
looking
to
get
more
of
this
overall
this
is
easily
in
my
top
5
pumpkin
beers
that
i
have
drank
i
love
it
when
ever
a
brewer
uses
brandy
barrels
they
really
did
a
fantstic
job
on
the
barrel
aging
of
this
beer
and
showed
the
deversity
of
a
brandy
barrel
another
great
almanac
beer
that
impresses
o
starting
from
a
barleywine
base
for
this
pumpkin
brew
is
absolutely
genius
hands
down
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
haver
had
t
perfect
kiss
of
brandy
with
a
slight
balanced
oakyness
and
a
pervasive
pumpkin
flavor
dancing
on
a
stage
of
spices
cinnamon
galore
nutmeg
and
clove
are
the
supporting
cast
a
truly
perfect
beer
reddish
caramel
dark
moderate
foamy
sandy
head
nice
lacing
spicy
nose
lots
of
clove
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
soft
alcohol
and
what
smells
like
the
advertised
brandy
spices
arent
as
strong
on
the
tongue
instead
its
a
rich
malty
and
candied
toffee
background
barrel
aging
is
noticeable
and
compliments
the
beer
well
very
smooth
balanced
not
over
done
with
spices
warming
a
bit
chewy
at
times
moderate
to
full
body
and
mouthfeel
delicious
i
had
no
trouble
finishing
this
bottle
and
would
have
continued
drinking
more
if
i
could
o
again
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
originality
in
beer
and
this
one
sure
dosent
disappoint
in
that
category
it
is
pretty
sweet
but
has
a
very
interesting
flavor
profile
i
have
another
one
of
these
and
will
probably
sit
on
it
till
at
least
thanksgiving
cheers
overall
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
tried
you
can
tell
there
is
a
great
barrelaged
barleywine
in
there
too
the
pumpkin
just
brings
it
to
a
whole
new
level
its
a
little
boozy
but
should
mellow
out
beautifully
with
time
4
50
o
thank
god
for
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
on
the
west
coast
too
bad
its
11
for
a
12
oz
this
beer
is
awesome
and
i
would
reccomend
to
ppl
looking
for
a
pumpkin
beer
or
a
new
beer
experience
as
the
barleywine
aspect
of
it
is
interesting
o
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
out
there
it
beats
unita
oak
jacked
epic
fermentation
without
representation
schafly
and
pumking
i
am
waiting
to
try
good
gourd
but
i
believe
that
is
the
only
pumpkin
beer
that
has
a
chance
a
being
better
then
this
one
o
the
nose
on
this
thing
is
absolutely
incredible
it
drinks
very
nice
with
a
big
bourbon
and
caramel
profile
with
pumpkin
on
the
back
end
another
phenomenal
beer
from
almanac
o
as
mentioned
above
this
is
another
fabulous
beer
from
almanac
while
i
have
an
affection
for
other
pumpkin
beers
this
one
is
leagues
above
the
competition
i
bought
a
couple
of
bottles
of
this
to
cellar
although
i
am
not
sure
that
they
will
make
it
though
the
coming
fall
season
o
this
barleywine
is
another
great
one
from
almanac
probably
my
new
favorite
barleywine
very
drinkable
and
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
after
drinking
this
i
bought
a
few
bottles
to
cellar
this
was
just
a
memorable
beer
that
makes
my
mouth
water
just
thinking
about
and
i
am
not
even
a
pumpkin
kind
of
guy
only
reason
i
did
not
give
it
a
5
right
now
is
because
i
know
this
will
get
better
with
some
age
t
a
nice
blend
of
pumpkin
flesh
and
spicy
sweetness
hints
of
pumpkin
pie
nutmeg
cinnamon
definitely
more
of
a
pumpkin
nut
loaf
flavor
than
pumpkin
pie
flavor
the
brandy
is
there
but
its
really
an
afterthought
which
i
kind
of
like
because
im
not
what
you
would
call
the
biggest
brandy
fan
really
well
done
pours
an
almost
clear
reddish
amber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
goes
down
quickly
scent
is
out
of
this
world
so
inviting
smells
absolutely
delicious
fresh
pumpkin
pie
and
sweet
thanksgiving
spices
nutmeg
cinnamon
allspice
the
amount
of
pumpkin
that
shines
through
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
ridiculous
hefty
amount
of
brandy
as
well
but
doesnt
smell
like
its
going
to
be
too
hot
taste
is
just
as
it
smells
magnificent
sweet
brandy
and
barrel
characteristics
up
front
immediately
followed
by
the
thanksgivingautumn
spices
sweet
pumpkin
pie
and
cinnamon
lovely
boozy
brandy
flavors
reminds
me
of
a
pumkin
loaf
i
had
one
time
that
was
made
with
brandy
oh
man
i
dont
see
it
getting
any
better
than
this
when
it
comes
to
pumpkin
beers
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
slightly
sticky
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
may
just
be
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
its
absolutely
delicious
i
know
this
beer
has
great
reviews
but
i
guarantee
you
once
this
beer
catches
the
beer
nerd
buzz
it
will
be
the
most
soughtafter
pumpkin
beer
out
there
spot
on
in
every
way
jd
pours
a
hazy
copper
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
pumpkin
pie
canned
pumpkin
spices
and
brandy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
pumpkin
pie
and
brandy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
an
awesome
pumpkin
pie
presence
that
is
especially
apparent
in
the
aroma
a
high
b
i
had
this
for
dessert
and
it
was
on
point
i
cant
say
enough
about
these
new
farm
to
barrel
beers
from
almanac
another
winner
note
ive
yet
to
try
schlaflys
pumpkin
ale
which
ive
heard
good
things
about
o
wonderful
beer
so
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
easily
in
the
top
handful
of
american
barleywines
i
have
ever
had
thanks
again
paul
for
hooking
me
up
4
5
2014
with
orange
wax
bottle
1226
of
1696
was
excited
to
try
this
for
a
while
it
did
not
perform
taste
and
smell
very
offensive
to
me
and
highly
barrel
forward
could
not
finish
mine
yellowish
amber
body
with
a
thin
cap
aromas
of
oak
bourbon
vanilla
malt
some
sweet
fruity
notes
more
complex
and
drinkable
than
the
standard
version
with
barrel
aging
characteristics
cutting
some
of
the
alcoholic
fruity
ester
sweetness
caramel
malt
lingers
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
pretty
good
bottle
from
trade
2013
batch
numbered
1431696
pours
murky
light
brownish
amber
with
a
creamy
off
white
and
yellowish
head
aroma
of
lemon
peel
caramel
oak
vanilla
flavor
follows
with
lots
of
lemon
hops
caramel
and
big
brown
sugar
lots
of
oak
light
vanilla
and
bourbon
heavy
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
some
nice
warmth
on
the
back
wen
with
the
oak
balancing
the
sweet
nicely
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
the
regular
version
it
is
a
solid
ba
barleywine
but
doesnt
come
together
as
well
as
id
hoped
the
hops
faded
considerably
but
in
the
end
they
do
not
work
very
well
with
the
barrel
overall
this
is
pretty
good
quite
oak
heavy
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
the
feel
is
a
bit
under
par
as
are
many
in
the
style
but
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
and
barrel
aging
well
executed
this
is
actually
more
barleywine
than
their
regular
behemoth
is
quality
and
worth
checking
out
if
you
get
the
chance
cheers
totoropanda
o
very
tasty
and
nice
no
bite
drinks
very
easily
slightly
hazy
dark
amber
bordering
on
brown
color
with
a
decent
sized
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
ring
on
the
top
huge
aromas
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
soaked
bourbon
with
bits
of
dark
fruit
like
cherries
plums
raisins
and
figs
the
flavor
is
sweet
but
packs
a
lots
of
bourbon
and
alcohol
to
counter
brown
sugar
and
caramel
with
a
solid
bit
of
bourbon
and
hints
of
vanilla
oak
and
dark
fruits
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
light
to
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
almost
syrupy
sharp
alcoholic
mouthfeel
this
beer
smells
fantastic
and
tastes
pretty
good
too
although
at
12
5
it
does
have
some
rough
alcohol
edges
i
enjoyed
sipping
on
this
for
most
of
the
night
and
wish
i
could
spend
more
nights
doing
the
same
thing
again
pour
is
cloudy
dark
burgundy
brown
with
a
small
amount
of
light
tan
head
lots
of
bourbon
even
from
a
distance
the
nose
is
huge
tons
of
bourbon
dark
malts
caramel
brown
sugar
dried
figs
taste
is
also
huge
lots
of
malt
sweetness
not
really
sugary
tons
of
dark
fruits
with
hints
of
apple
lots
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
bourbon
plays
in
nicely
less
prevalent
than
the
nose
would
have
had
me
believe
very
full
body
a
hint
sugary
soft
palate
but
gets
a
touch
grainy
overall
its
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
but
very
tasty
i
love
behemoth
but
damn
they
actually
improved
on
it
a
relatively
light
body
for
a
beer
of
this
abv
and
barrel
aged
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
toffee
bourbon
and
wood
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
caramel
and
bourbon
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
pretty
boozy
and
hot
d
significantly
better
than
regular
behemoth
much
like
regular
dark
lord
its
bizarre
how
this
transforms
inside
a
barrel
o
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
here
i
mean
the
beer
is
good
but
absolutely
not
worth
the
price
i
paid
for
it
i
actually
happen
to
have
another
one
hopefully
it
will
be
better
than
this
one
o
not
exactly
sure
why
this
world

the

this
brew
has
taken
on
a

the

is
more
of

imagining

very
aromatic
and
lush

hops
and

standout
taste
of

soon
after

peasantly

mixed
with

the

blending
in

mouthfeel
has
hop
bitterness
lingering
in

of

lay
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
really
a
treat
not
one
component
outdoes
the
other
well
done
my
first
blonde
barleywine
this
is
much
more
hop
forward
throughout
with
less
sweetness
than
typical
barleywines
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
comes
out
but
is
masked
early
on
a
terrific
beer
than
i
would
gladly
drink
again

honest
if
ipas
turn
to
barleywine
with
too
much

this
still
has
a
way
to
go
to
reach
barleywine
status
orange
wax
bottle
alcohol
smell
was
non
existent
fruity
notes
remained
in
the
nose
poured
a
very
hazy
copper
color
taste
was
dark
fruit
cherry
plum
prune
with
a
nice
sweetness
i
greatly
enjoyed
this
the
hops
obviously
faded
and
this
almost
resembled
a
quad
but
it
was
fantastic
nonetheless
the
hops
are
very
pronounced
and
the
alcohol
heat
is
present
but
tucked
behind
the
hop
burst
a
great
medfull
full
body
mouth
feel
overall
a
good
barley
wine
even
if
it
is
slightly
off
the
traditional
flavor
profile
and
more
along
three
floyds
hop
forward
mo
glass
snifter
better
than
bigfoot
in
my
opinion
absolutely
worth
a
purchase
if
available
and
one
who
enjoys
american
bws
just
an
awful
barleywine
that
tastes
like
an
ipa
just
like
everything
from
3
floyds
other
than
dark
lord
semihoppy
barleywine
more
for
a
barleywineipa
drinker
not
bad
just
not
my
thing
very
good
beer
has
the
delicious
notes
you
except
from
a
fine
barley
wine
such
as
toffee
raisins
dark
fruit
has
an
unexpected
touch
of
fruitiness
in
there
reminiscent
of
apples
andor
pears
isnt
overly
sweet
or
boozy
slightly
metallic
in
the
finish
very
good
take
on
the
style
just
not
quite
sure
id
go
through
the
effort
and
expense
it
took
to
get
it
again
overall
great
barley
wine
hoppy
fruity
dangerously
strong
this
beer
isnt
bad
im
just
not
a
fan
of
the
hoppiness
as
i
figure
out
my
tastes
i
can
easily
say
that
strong
citrus
hops
arent
my
thing
as
far
as
hippy
beers
go
this
isnt
awful
overall
this
was
a
surprisingly
and
remarkably
hopped
beer
aromatically
i
guess
we
werent
quite
sure
what
to
expect
for
a
blonde
barleywine
but
for
some
reason
a
major
hoppy
component
wasnt
it
it
was
pleasant
translating
well
into
flavoring
sadly
it
remained
way
up
front
in
the
mouth
getting
battered
by
waves
of
sharp
booze
and
heavy
grain
this
introductory
taste
actually
made
us
think
of
a
super
zombie
dust
it
was
so
hopped
again
however
you
then
hit
this
monstrous
wall
of
bitters
puckers
and
chemicals
all
that
said
weve
had
dipas
that
are
bigger
malt
bombs
than
this
barleywine
but
the
booze
keeps
you
in
line
with
your
thinking
at
least
this
works
when
remembering
style
this
beer
wasnt
bad
but
it
just
kind
of
took
us
for
a
loop
following
that
description
if
you
want
a
big
big
beer
that
isnt
afraid
to
show
you
what
it
is
then
this
is
the
ticket
for
you
our
friend
overall
an
exceptional
representation
of
a
barleywine
in
my
opinion
fff
always
seems
to
hit
home
runs
for
me
i
really
liked
this
beer
behemoth
pours
a
wonderful
dark
brown
with
a
thin

and
good
lacing
this
is
extremely
well
balanced
with
plummy
and

notes

id
say
this
would
be
a

candidate
to

or
have
as
a
barrel
aged
brew
as
it
is
it
is
a
hop
bomber
that
hits
just
a
bit
strong
for
the
style
seems
to
have
aged
well
no
overt
oxidization
good
stuff
deep

with
only
a
thin
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
big
hop
notes
on
the
nose
along
with
some
brown
butterburnt
caramel
definitely
an
american
barleywine
this
is
like
a
dipa
with
the
malt
bill
kicked
up
for
added
body
and
sweetness
it
works
very
well
this
is
surprisingly
drinkable
and
almost
refreshing
at
such
a
high
abv
definitely
worthwhile
for
hopheads
out
there
a
decent
hoppy
barleywine
the
big
problem
is
that
its
lacking
anything
particularly
interesting
no
flavors
that
really
grab
me
not
particularly
well
balanced
its
what
id
expect
but
nothing
more
o
not
bad
everything
seems
to
come
together
nicely
but
nothing
really
pops
o
very
nice
this
is
certainly
a
3f
ale
in
respect
tot
the
level
of
hops
which
are
very
high
this
is
a
great
ale
to
share
very
strong
and
very
well
crafted
i
certainly
recommend
this
ale
overall
not
that
special
of
an
american
barleywine
overly
hopped
as
youd
expect
from
a
three
floyds
beer
o
dont
know
why
you
would
age
this
beer
fresh
is
the
way
to
go
fresh
hop
aroma
great
bitterness
its
bassicly
a
dipa
with
a
bigger

body
this
is
a
very
impressive
brew
its
definitely
hop
forward
and
has
alot
of
dipa
characteristics
but
theres
no
question
that
its
a
barleywine
its
pretty
pricey
but
its
well
crafted
i
really
like
this
one
fresh
but
age
will
not
hurt
it

dotted

glass
with

of
thick
sweet
malts
and
somewhat
offputting
old
resinous
hop
oils
some
neutral
alcohol
on
the
palate
caramel
malts
brown

bubblegum
some

and
more
of
the

detected
in
the
aroma
hints
of
acetone
hmm
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
more
carbonation
than
expected
it
was
good
but
not
overall
what
i
expect
from
a
barleywine
and
i
wasnt
really
sold
on
it
a
great
barleywine
for
hopheads
not
sure
what
to
pair
it
with
great
by
itself
but
by
the
time
im
done
with
this
bomber
ill
be
bombed
o
sweet
and
not
bitter
as
the
nose
would
suggest
good
beer
o
a
very
nice
example
of
an
american

wisely

very
smooth
to

as

are
sometimes
hard

like
because
theyre
so
aggressive
this
is
smooth

and
hot
its
very

not
only
for
the
style
but
in
general
three
floyds
has
another
hit
with
this
behemoth
of
a
beer
reviewed
7707
i
originally
thought
this
beer
was
going
to
an
alcoholic
mess
but
i
temporary
forgot
that
this
was
a
3f
beer
this
was
a
well
done
semi
sweet
and
flavorful
barleywine
i
would
very
much
like
another
bottle
to
age
overall
this
barleywine
held
up
to
the
hype
and
offered
a
fantastic
experience
very
well
executed
and
its
holding
up
well
still
has
some
faint
hops
shining
through
and
i
can
only
imagine
how
much
enamel
this
peel
off
your
teeth
fresh
something
id
definitely
keep
my
eye
out
for
in
the
future
both
fresh
and
aged
reveal
huh
i
deservingly
got
laughed
at
for
being
so
sure
it
was
not
behemoth
i
would
have
given
this
a
3
75
medium
to
full
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
as
mentioned
before
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
suspect
the
alcohol
would
have
been
pretty
strong
if
i
drank
this
beer
fresh
very
nicely
made
and
i
would
gladly
buy
this
again
if
i
get
the
chance
o
this
is
awesome
its
complex
and
changes
with
ever
sip
3
floyd
nailed
it
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
it

the
hops
here
are
awesome
and
it
is
extremely
well
balanced

orange
wax
edition
shared
with
friends
thank
goodness
this
beast
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
with
lots
of
yeast
sediment
and
maybe
an
inch
of
just
off
white
head
the
nose
is
really
sweet
english
toffee
dark
caramel
brown
sugar
and
beet
sugars
as
well
there
is
also
a
lot
of
hops
not
quite
hog
heaven
level
but
this
is
definitely
an
american
barleywine
with
some
pine
notes
and
even
some
tropical
fruits
emanating
from
the
hopping
the
taste
is
crisp
for
how
sweet
it
is
and
i
think
the
hops
do
save
this
beer
from
being
just
a
sugar
bomb
the
alcohol
is
piercing
and
the
flavors
all
combine
to
be
like
a
really
good
bread
pudding
sort
of
odd
in
a
beer
but
i
enjoyed
the
flavors
coming
together
as
they
did
the
feel
is
a
little
sluggish
not
quite
bubbly
enough
and
the
sweetness
starts
to
take
hold
after
half
a
glass
or
so
this
beer
becomes
pretty
punishing
when
its
warm
but
so
do
most
barleywines
i
know
its
the
wrong
time
of
year
for
this
so
maybe
that
had
something
to
do
with
my
dislike
of
the
mouthfeel
but
this
is
a
complex
and
enjoyable
beer
nevertheless
still
waiting
to
be
blown
away
by
three
floyds
though
overalli
have
had
barleywines
that
i
like
more
then
this
for
one
reason
or
the
other
but
i
cant
recall
one
that
is
this
even
i
really
cant
say
that
enough
it
could
be
because
i
aged
this
a
little
but
the
hops
are
completly
even
with
the
malts
price
is
a
little
expensive
but
its
worth
it
for
this
beer
an
all
night
sipper
4
overall
i
am
a
huge
english
style
barleywine
fan
but
damn
does
fff
hit
the
mark
on
this
one
it
has
their
well
known
hop
profile
with
a
candied
sweetness
in
perfect
harmony
love
this
beer
i
have
had
three
vintages
of
this
monster
i
love
love
barley
wine
but
the
behemoth
seems
to
stand
out
compared
to
the
others
it
has
that
signature
floyds
taste
to
it
even
for
being
a
barley
wine
sweet
touch
of
hoppiness
and
goes
down
very
very
smooth
i
wish
that
this
was
a
year
around
beaty
verdict
a
good
but
not
great
barleywine
from
three
floyds
best
when
super
fresh
and
with
some
years
on
it
but
the
hops
do
feel
a
bit
out
of
place
in
this
brew
an
interesting
experiment
in
the
american
style
but
doesnt
match
the
smooth
rich
complexity
of
an
english
style
barleywine
skol
im
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
the
hops
are
in
a
great
place
right
now
imo
however
i
think
the
mouth
feel
and
sweetness
will
benefit
with
some
age
i
just
hope
the
hops
stay
strong
with
time
in
which
case
this
will
be
a
phenomenal
brew
overall
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
as
hudson
got
some
in
very
good
stuff
it
does
remind
me
more
of
a
sweet
dipa
than
a
hoppy
barleywine
but
thats
fine
by
me
nice
and
hoppy
but
not
bitter
solid
sweetness
but
not
cloying
tasty
stuff
d
pretty
easily
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
i
think
some
time
on
it
will
do
wonders
at
least
i
hope
so
for
the
16
a
bottle
i
spent
easily
the
best
barley
wine
i
have
had
but
that
is
more
due
to
the
hops
than
anything
else
overall
the
only
big
beer
i
got
from
three
floyds
during
my
trip
to
indiana
but
a
winner
the
flavor
is
complex
and
taste
i
wish
i
could
taste
an
aged
one
cause
i
think
itd
play
out
real
nice
for
the
price
its
definitely
a
treat
but
if
it
was
available
where
i
live
i
might
pick
up
one
a
year
and
let
it
go
from
there
extremely
pleased
with
this
one
thanks
very
much
scott
overall
a
really
great
american
style
barleywine
huge
hop
taste
with
some
really
nice
citrus
esters
ipa
like
with
the
hops
but
a
big
enough
boozy
malt
presence
to
remind
you
that
it
is
a
barleywine
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
this
is
a
decent
barleywine
a
little
bit
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
and
very
booze
forward
not
bad
and
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
how
last
years
bottle
held
up
bottom
line
exceptional
barley
wine
beer
o
i
honestly
would
not
know
this
was
a
barleywine
yes
i
understand
it
was
the
american
version
but
it
really
tastes
and
feels
like
a
imperial
ipa
with
a
small
amount
of
sweet
red
wine
added
whatever
you
wanna
call
it
it
did
enjoy
it
while
very
sweet
i
would
recommend
it
it
drinks
almost
like
an
imperial
ipa
which
is
perhaps
why
i
like
this
so
much
im
really
torn
between
saving
the
other
i
have
and
drinking
it
soon
hopefully
i
can
get
more
so
both
will
be
an
option
another
win
from
three
floyds
in
my
book
and
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
it
o
i
can
see
why
some
people
who
have
specific
ideas
of
what
a
barleywine
should
be
may
find
this
a
bit
off
but
overall
it
is
still
an
exceptional
beer
again
will
let
a
couple
sit
and
see
when
the
hops
recede
what
other
flavors
may
emerge
really
interesting
well
balanced
and
approachable
beer
i
love
a
good
barleywine
and
this
one
does
well
nice
job
to
fff
overall
i
am
not
surpirsed
three
floyds
would
bring
the
heavy
hops
in
their
barley
wine
this
is
my
favorite
style
and
i
probably
prefer
the
creamy
barley
over
bitter
hops
but
no
doubt
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
just
with
the
classic
three
floyds
taste
ive
got
another
bottle
that
i
look
forward
to
sitting
on
for
a
while
and
revisiting
this
brew
in
about
a
year
final
thoughts
the
barleywine
style
is
one
that
ive
recently
started
seeking
out
and
ive
become
something
of
a
connoisseur
what
you
have
here
is
a
very
good
beer
and
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
a
hop
head
who
has
a
sweet
tooth
would
definitely
enjoy
this
one
the
sheer
body
of
this
beer
is
enough
to
make
any
craft
beer
enthusiast
content
if
you
have
access
to
it
and
like
dipas
or
barleywines
then
pull
the
trigger
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
id
age
one
pours
a
nearly
opaque
murky
amber
color
with
a
big
fat
head
light
caramel
head
mild
sweet
toffee
on
the
nose
a
bit
of
dried
fruit
as
well
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
mediumbodied
almost
creamy
a
lot
of
dried
fruit
in
the
flavor
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
and
some
bitterness
at
the
finish
decent
not
great
very
easy
to
drink
and
one
of
the
hoppiest
barleywines
i
have
ever
had
it
reminds
me
slightly
of
avery
hog
heaven
actually
if
you
can
find
this
pick
it
up
but
it
is
kinda
expensive
at
19bomber
overall
hard
to
believe
its
10
5
abv
everything
is
blended
so
well
i
cant
imagine
the
time
and
energy
it
takes
to
perfect
something
like
this
a
very
solid
brew
but
easy
to
understand
why
its
a
seasonal
i
look
forward
to
getting
it
again
next
year
and
i
definitely
want
to
try
one
of
the
barrel
aged
versions
at
some
point
overall
despite
being
more
of
an
imperial
ipa
it
has
rich
malts
flavors
that
balance
well
with
the
hops
happy
i
grabbed
a
bottle
of
this
im
not
sure
how
an
aged
behemothregular
behemoth
would
be
wish
i
could
try
the
barrel
aged
versions
oone
of
the
few
barleywines
i
had
fresh
and
really
liked
not
sure
if
aging
would
do
this
any
good
o
a
very
enjoyable
barleywine
but
could
have
used
more
hop
bitterness
in
my
opinion
all
of
the
beers
by
three
floyds
are
great
but
this
one
might
be
a
little
better
when
aged
in
a
bottle
i
will
have
to
purchase
it
at
the
store
and
give
it
another
try
to
see
how
it
compares
this
is
a
beer
aficionados
must
try
o
i
love
this
beer
its
really
fueled
my
barley
wine
obsession
always
look
forward
to
when
the
beer
comes
out
love
the
artwork
and
of
course
the
wax
overall
this
beer
is
really
goodthe
guy
at
the
brew
pub
said
this
was
one
of
their
more
sought
after
beers
and
i
can
see
whythree
floyds
do
a
fantastic
job
with
their
citrus
hops
flavored
beers
and
here
theyve
got
them
playing
so
nicely
with
sweet
caramel
maltsa
hint
of
the
higher
abv
but
thats
to
be
expected
from
this
style
and
it
does
add
to
the
overall
flavorits
superbly
drinkable
and
wonderfully
flavored
my
only
knock
is
the
price
tagi
paid
15
for
a
bomber
total
splurge
i
bought
at
wholesale
im
not
sure
what
theyd
charge
at
a
store
and
while
its
good
i
have
a
hard
time
recommending
anything
that
expensiveis
it
good
yeahis
it
worth
15
maybebut
if
your
like
me
and
occasionally
spend
for
beers
typically
out
of
your
price
range
this
is
a
good
experimental
choice4

this
is
my
favorite
beer
by
3
floyds
i
wish
more
people
appreciated
this
brew
like
i
do
the
appearance
is
a
dark
amber
color
the
smell
is
really
fruity
it
tastes
fruity
as
wellbut
you
can
tell
their
is
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
in
it
not
a
real
hoppy
one
if
any
at
all
nicely
carbonated
overall
i
would
and
will
drink
this
one
again
poured
deep
gold
almost
a
tangerineish
hue
adorned
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
cap
which
took
forever
to
diminish
smell
is
a
jumble
of
sweetness
like
a
rich
honey
type
mixed
with
biscuit
and
orange
blossom
hugely
hoppy
towards
the
back
of
the
palate
much
bitterness
with
a
semicitrusyherbalsprucey
quality
boozy
finish
nicely
carbonated
taste
at
first
it
has
the
floral
hoppy
bitterness
that
is
similar
to
an
ipa
but
then
it
is
followed
by
a
sweet
almost
malty
flavor
that
is
really
a
nice
compliment
it
finishes
with
a
slight
bitterness
that
is
a
cross
between
a
roasted
and
hoppy
bitter
overall
a
nice
barleywine
but
to
be
honest
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
based
on
what
ive
had
from
these
guys
id
like
to
try
a
fresh
one
some
time
o
this
is
a
potentially
dangerous
brew
since
the
alcohol
content
is
concealed
so
well
i
could
see
myself
going
overboard
with
this
if
it
were
readily
available
to
me
if
i
ever
find
this
on
tap
its
all
over
endless
thanks
to
irishhockey
for
hooking
this
one
up
overall
really
nice
american
barleywine
but
not
my
style
of
choice
o
wow
im
glad
i
pulled
this
one
because
it
was
a
joy
to
drink
my
cellar
is
a
little
on
the
warm
side
so
i
thought
it
would
be
good
to
take
a
crack
at
this
guy
i
am
glad
i
did
it
is
a
malty
masterpiece
with
a
good
dose
of
bitterness
to
keep
this
very
drinkable
the
hop
nuances
are
long
gone
but
that
doesnt
matter
this
is
a
superb
barleywine
4

m
its
a
big
medium
not
quite
full
bodied
its
rather
chewy
though
i
know
that
this
beer
is
incredibly
hoppy
when
its
fresh
and
almost
drinks
like
a
iipa
or
iiipa
after
several
months
the
hops
have
receded
a
little
and
the
beer
is
now
drinking
like
a
great
barleywine
it
is
a
musttry
for
fans
of
american
barleywines
i
hope
to
buy
it
every
year

that
doesnt

on
the

smell
is
pretty
sweet
with
fig
fruits
and
sugar
plenty
of
malts
also
on
the
nose
taste
is
surprisingly
bitter
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
i
thought
it
would
be
still
some
alcohol
on
the
palate
lots
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
really
good
not
nearly
as
straight
forward
as
most
barleywines
i
like
the
hop
characteristics
which
balances
the
sweetness
smells
of
heavy
pineapples
in
syrup
figs
raisins
toffee
mangoes
and
grapefruit
pith
and
gooey
caramel
sauce
with
medium
levels
of
booziness
you
can
really
tell
that
this
is
a
heavy
malt
bomb
from
the
aroma
alone
tastes
of
medicinal
piney
resinous
hops
over
caramel
sauce
peaches
and
apricots
that
partially
dries
up
in
the
finish
with
some
herbal
hopping
and
a
rising
boozy
hotness
o
this
is
a
great
american
style
barleywine
very
hoppy
perhaps
one
of
the
hoppiest
ive
had
its
not
overly
sweet
or
overly
bitter
great
balance
of
flavors
with
tons
of
complexity
im
not
sure
i
could
identify
all
the
flavors
myself
musthave
if
youre
a

hard
to
put
a
finger
on
this
one
for
me
sweetness
seemed
just
a
little
too
much
this
is
quite
a
tasty
american
barleywine
with
some
nice
complexity
in
both
the
malts
and
hops
this
is
a
fresh
bottle
and
i
bet
the
malts
would
get
better
with
age
but
the
hops
may
not
so
i
guess
you
have
to
decide
on
your
priorities
overall
three
floyds
continues
to
show
me
that
they
are
masters
of
big
beers
crazy
depth
of
flavor
with
some
insane
hopping
to
make
it
even
better
malts
are
well
balanced
and
big
get
it
drink
it
love
it
drink
its
flavorful
just
not
used
to
the
blonde
aspect
still
i
would
have
an
older
vintage
to
see
how
develops
o
definitely
a
solid
barleywine
and
glad
ive
had
different
variations
of
this
great
brew
three

and
a
thin

casts
a
good
amount
of
lace
flowery
hop
aromas
surprised
us
at
first
but
upon
our
second
sniff
the
flowery
aromas
invited
us
in
with
a
slight
breadiness
underneath
and
a
subtle
hint
of
alcohol
the
brew
starts
out
sweet
with
a
slight
alcohol
burn
that
quickly
fades
into
a
delightful
hop
bitterness
before
finishing
dry
medium
in

behemoth

in

and
not
a
beer
for
the
week
of
heart
wish
we
had
another
overall
this
is
an
awesome
barelywine
huge
and
complex
and
wonderful
i
dont
know
how
i
took
this
long
to
try
it
already
when
ive
had
2
for
some
time
now
huge
thanks
to
azdback
and
whoever
else
sent
me
one
of
these
i
apologize
for
the
fact
that
i
cant
remember
who
else
sent
me
one
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
this
beer
is
very
good
and
im
looking
forward
to
aging
my
second
one
for
a
while
if
i
can
make
it
that
long
without
drinking
it
overall
just
as
good
as
i
remember
it
not
much
difference
from
the
age
still
excellent
i
would
be
happy
if
i
could
get
this
beer
on
a
regular
basis
three
floyds
has
lost
a
little
bit
of
fandom
from
me
since
i
went
to
dl
day
and
their
distribution
lacks
even
where
they
distribute
to
sometimes
i
wonder
if
they
make
more
than
robert
the
bruce
but
this
is
enough
to
bring
me
back
to
their
side
of
the
fence
definitely
a
sipper
but
hell
ill
sip
it
all
night
the
palate
however
falls
rather
flat
heavy
on
the
crystal
malt
this
is
astringent
without
thankfully
too
much
sweetness
while
the
astringency
does
fade
as
the
beer
warms
up
and
has
time
to
breathe
it
is
initially
rather
unpleasant
this
beer
is
pretty
big
and
sweet
the
hops
have
faded
gracefully
leaving
some
mild
pine
bitterness
and
some
citrus
fruitiness
the
midpalate
has
plenty
of
fruit
with
red
delicious
apples
a
little
grape
alcohol
does
appear
on
the
finish
mildly
warming
full
in
body
this
is
soft
and
lush
on
the
palate
the
finish
has
crystal
malt
and
a
mild
bitterness
decent
stuff
the
alcohol
is
rather
wellhidden
imo
however
there
just
isnt
enough
malt
complexity
to
keep
this
interesting
on
the
palate
nor
is
it
worthy
of
time
in
a
cellar
imo
overall
god
this
really
is
closer
to
a
ipa
then
any
barleywine
ive
ever
had
makes
me
wish
i
had
a
bottle
or
two
to
age
to
see
waht
this
becomes
in
a
couple
years
really
tasty
loads
of
flavor
and
not
overly
sweet
price
tag
was
a
bit
much
so
if
i
ever
get
the
chance
ill
grab
one
bottle
and
cellar
it
worth
a
drink
for
sure
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
but
theres
not
much
barleywine
about
it
really
it
is
too
hop
forward
and
lacks
a
big
enough
malt
base
to
put
it
in
this
style
classification
perhaps
a
couple
years
of
age
will
do
this
one
some
good
but
fresh
its
simply
another
hop
bomb
of
a
dipa
this
makes
scoring
it
a
tough
task
as
it
was
a
really
nice
beer
but
was
also
mislabled
anyways
this
is
a
beer
id
gladly
drink
in
mass
quantities
but
not
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
barleywine
thanks
for
the
cool
beer
irishgurl4
despite
the
score
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
o
even
after
4
years
the
hops
are
still
going
strong
although
the
age
has
smoothed
things
out
getting
rid
of
most
of
the
bitterness
to
let
the
sweetness
come
out
good
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
age
it
o
awesome
barleywine
a
big
feel
and
a
big
flavor
another
winner
from
3f
o
this
is
a
nice
barleywine
kind
of
like
a
bigfoot
lite
to
me
as
a
fan
of
barleywines
ive
always
dug
it
the
2
years
on
this
one
doesnt
seem
to
have
harmed
it
but
i
remember
enjoying
it
more
fresh
nonetheless
a
worthy
barleywine
from
a
worthy
brewery
this
is
a
medium
boded
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
a
bold
sipper
of
a
brew
but
overall
is
pretty
well
put
together
for
an
american
style
barleywine
fans
of
brutal
dipas
will
find
love
in
this
offering
worth
a
try
for
sure
o
a
solid
barleywine
but
needs
some
age
to
cool
off
the
booze
factor
a
bit
definitely
hop
forward
with
a
lot
of
spicy
bitter
characteristics
its
tempered
however
with
the
traditional
ripe
fruit
and
caramel
notes
pretty
good
stuff
here
o
i
think
one
year
isnt
enough
but
four
years
is
too
much
im
going
to
drink
my
other
bottle
with
two
or
three
years
of
age
on
it
overall
this
was
a
great
american
barley
wine
a
little
different
per
fffs
usual
antics
definitely
a
little
over
hyped
but
still
very
good
overall
an
exquisitely
well
balanced
barleywine
with
a
nice
fruity
alcohol
presence
and
a
big
dose
of
hops
the
best
way
i
can
put
it
a
creamier
fresh
bigfoot
overall
this
is
a
great
barleywine
but
i
do
have
to
say
i
enjoyed
the
2011
a
bit
more
and
i
did
consume
it
back
then
as
well
this
years
offering
seemed
more
boozy
and
hoppy
neither
of
which
is
a
bad
thing
but
i
just
remember
last
years
batch
going
down
very
very
easy
i
know
ill
buy
this
again
but
at
18
99
a
bomber
it
is
tough
to
justify
more
than
a
bottle
or
two
o
its
pretty
straightforward
american
barleywine
on
the
sweet
side
more
or
less
what
id
expect
but
i
usually
look
to
3f
to
defy
expectations
so
in
that
sense
a
little
disappointing
still
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
fuller
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
time
has
done
this
beer
really
well
i
was
surprised
to
still
get
a
little
kick
from
the
hops
which
worked
really
well
with
the
rest
of
the
profile
i
definitely
want
more
of
this
its
a
top
notch
barleywine
its
on
the
hoppy
side
but
still
well
balanced

overall
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
with
some
nice
citrusy
aromas
and
flavors
o
per
the
side
of
the
bottle
its
not
normal
what
a
great
barleywine
there
could
be
a
blurring
of
the
lines
between
an
american
barleywine
a
dipa
its
not
overly
complex
but
theres
not
a
whole
lot
of
things
taking
away
from
this
beer
o
the
light
malt
base
made
it
more
of
a
bitter
slightly
dark
ipa
great
beer
and
id
love
to
keep
one
for
a
few
years
to
see
what
happens
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
has
some
large
bubbles
to
it
as
well
as
the
small
ones
takes
a
few
minutes
for
the
head
to
disappear
which
is
about
right
in
the
smell
i
get
the
normal
hop
characteristics
of
all
fff
beers
which
makes
for
an
amazing
smell
odd
to
get
in
a
barley
wine
but
this
is
fff
after
all
after
the
hops
i
get
a
deep
and
profound
sweetness
throughout
the
smell
is
up
there
as
one
of
the
most
pleasant
smelling
beers
out
there
taste
wise
this
beer
is
very
complex
at
first
you
get
a
very
nice
smoothness
to
it
then
you
get
a
hit
from
the
hops
like
a
pale
ale
and
then
it
finishes
with
the
sweet
alcohol
ending
like
most
barley
wines
have
the
sweetness
and
smoothness
fade
away
to
leave
the
hops
that
everyone
knows
and
loves
about
fff
beers
to
linger
on
the
palate
for
a
while
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
leaves
a
residue
on
the
inside
of
the
mouth
after
consuming
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
barley
wine
i
have
had
and
was
intending
to
age
this
but
was
told
to
drink
it
sooner
rather
than
later
as
it
loses
some
of
the
hop
characteristic
i
would
recommend
this
beer
and
next
time
i
will
pick
up
2
and
age
one
o
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
above
average
in
every
respect
it
is
so
drinkable
and
dangerous
at
10
5
abv
youll
definitely
want
more
than
one
o
has
to
be
a
hop
bomb
fresh
get
remnants
of
the
hops
but
it
adds
a
lot
to
the
beer
at
this
point
in
time
scary
easy
to
drink
as
could
drink
a
bomber
of
this
very
quickly
overall
this
beer
is
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
but
not
all
that
complex
in
my
opinion
price
is
rather
steep
but
im
glad
at
least
tried
it
out
o
very
good
quite
hoppy
certainly
a
well
done
beer
and
highly
recommendable
overall
a
decent
barleywine
but
sure
not
worth
the
price
id
rather
get
a
few
stone
old
guardians
than
this
o
good
american
barleywine
but
the
hops
dominate
this
beer
would
like
the
malts
to
come
through
more
this
like
many
others
recently
it
seems
flirts
with
what
style
it
is
american
barleywine
or
dipa
overall
this
is
an
awesome
barley
wine
and
i
will
drink
again
and
again
probably
my
second
favorite
winter
beer
o
very
good
barleywine
seems
like
it
has
age
well
in
the
year
its
had
would
love
to
have
this
with
a
few
years
on
it
m
medium
to
full
body
with
a
massive
chew
sludgy
lots
of
sticky
resiny
tonguecoating
hop
oils
light
carbonation
o
another
solid
brew
from
three
floyds
i
was
expecting
less
hops
however
but
thats
nearly
crazy
talk
when
thinking
fff
but
hey
hops
are
great
and
so
is
this
beer
i
wouldnt
say
its
their
best
offering
nor
would
i
say
its
the
best
the
barleywine
style
has
to
offer
im
looking
forward
for
this
one
aged
a
year
or
so
yes
i
couldnt
resist
not
stashing
one
back
in
a
cool
dark
place
bottles
with
wax
just
beg
for
some
cellaring
overall
another
awesome
beer
from
3f
that
is
an
interesting
take
on
barleywines
very
hop
heavy
for
the
style
o
a
pretty
tasty
barleywine
i
just
had
boogoop
last
week
and
am
very
impressed
with
the
fff
barleywine
collection
2011
bottle
pours
a
bright
and
mostly
clear
orange
tinted
brown
minimal
cap
of
off
white
froth
gone
quickly
even
after
a
year
the
scent
is
dominated
by
hops
muted
pine
and
mildly
bright
citrus
lead
backbone
brings
notes
of
buttery
toffee
light
caramel
and
whiskey
when
poured
at
about
4045
degrees
the
flavor
still
had
a
decent
hop
profile
while
the
sweetness
was
light
and
the
malts
did
not
provide
much
character
as
it
approached
room
temperature
flavor
blossomed
with
nice
toffee
and
whiskey
notes
found
in
scent
hops
still
lead
the
overall
profile
though
while
carbonation
was
at
a
nice
level
the
beer
felt
a
little
too
light
for
the
style
lacking
any
sticky
or
coating
texture
or
even
smoothness
great
scent
and
taste
from
this
hop
centric
barleywine
body
lacking
compared
to
many
other
true
barleywines
o
if
you
see
this
beer
i
recommend
you
try
it
even
if
you
dont
share
my
opinion
im
sure
you
wont
regret
it
really
fits
more
with
a
dipa
to
me
as
with
everything
fff
they
arent
stingy
with
the
hops
lighter
mouthfeel
than
most
barleywines
i
like
it
but
its
not
traditional
id
prefer
a
bit
more
citrus
hop
otherwise
very
tasty
even
if
it
really
isnt
a
traditional
bw
the
really
impressive
part
of
this
beer
is
how
it
manages
to
balance
these
light
flavors
and
strong
finish
without
overpowering
either
just
had
this
beer
on
draft
in
the
oregon
district
in
dayton
ohio
one
of
my
top
5
favorite
beers
the
most
hoppy
barleywine
ever
really
reminds
me
of
the
dreadnaught
from
the
same
brewery
very
smooth
barleywine
without
the
overpowering
alcohol
finish
three
floyds
is
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
all
of
their
creations
cheers
overall
really
a
good
beer
i
enjoyed
it
i
have
had
it
out
of
the
bottle
but
on
tap
is
just
a
bit
better
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
o
drinkable
each
sip
kept
me
interested
which
can
be
a
problem
with
heavyhighalcohol
beers
sometimes
the
more
beer
i
drink
the
more
i
feel
that
this
is
a
hopforward
brewery
with
a
hopforward
agendaand
i
love
it
this
is
not
a
typical
barleywine
its
more
like
a
double
ipa
but
its
very
good
if
youre
a
hophead
if
not
stay
far
away
from
this
one
cheers
overall
great
beast
of
a
brew
that
packs
a
fruity
and
malty
punch
cost
16
99
for
a
22
oz
bomber
bottle
taste
is
fruity
and
hopflavor
forward
bitterness
is
actually
fairly
tame
and
malts
are
brighter
than
i
intially
thought
from
the
nose
more
caramel
and
sugary
than
earthy
its
good
i
think
this
one
is
tasty
fresh
not
sure
what
would
happen
to
it
in
the
cellar
overall
a
good
beer
but
needs
some
time
for
the
alcohol
to
mellow
ive
enjoyed
less
expensive
barleywines
more
i
was
hoping
for
more
complexity
at
around
1718
after
tax
this
is
a
stiff
hard
to
swallow
price
on
a
beer
that
said
this
is
really
really
good
beer
maybe
even
pushing
great
drop
the
price
to
1415
and
this
is
a
winner
that
said
this
once
again
showcases
the
amazing
hops
and
malt
flavors
that
all
three
floyds
beers
beers
have
im
not
sure
what
they
are
doing
but
from
pride
and
joy
all
the
way
up
to
behmonth
the
amazing
hop
and
malt
flavors
stay
unquestionably
theirs
i
feel
the
price
requires
a
full
pint
off
the
overall
score
o
really
impressed
i
will
be
looking
for
this
beer
in
the
future
this
is
the
barleywine
that
makes
me
like
barleywinesthough
it
is
quite
expensive
overall
this
beer
goes
down
really
well
with
a
great
mellowed
out
taste
i
havent
had
it
fresh
with
a
hop
presence
but
this
is
extremely
nice
as
it
is
a
very
good
winter
brew
and
my
favorite
barleywine
to
date
palate
is
citrus
heavy
and
pretty
bitter
with
a
fairly
dry
and
light
malt
backbone
for
a
12
5
beer
some
nice
tropical
fruit
undertones
light
sugary
pale
malt
ends
like
a
dipa
with
a
big
bitter
hop
bite
ive
had
this
before
aged
and
didnt
care
for
it
but
fresh
its
rather
delicious
o
i
love
barleywines
but
american
barleywines
are
sometimes
a
bit
hoppier
than
id
like
id
held
onto
this
one
for
several
months
hoping
it
might
tone
the
hop
bitterness
down
a
bit
well
whether
the
time
in
the
bottle
helped
make
this
one
that
much
better
or
it
was
really
a
stellar
one
to
begin
with
the
beer
i
tasted
was
one
hell
of
a
barleywine
get
this
one
if
you
can
this
was
a
nice
surprise
from
three
floyds
and
fortunately
this
doesnt
suffer
the
sugaroverload
that
their
other
waxed
creation
dark
lord
exhibits
fresh
a
nice
balance
of
malts
fruitiness
and
sweetness
was
achieved
here
and
putting
the
blonde
twist
on
the
style
was
welcomed
here

some
bready

and

some
bright

with

just
a
hint
of
booze
and
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
with
a

drinkability
is
fairly
high
overall
this
is
a
very
delightful
barleywine
overall
a
tasty
barly
wine
very
bready
not
very
complex
very
drinkable
overall
the
2011
is
really
quite
nice
a
complex
sipper
it
could
be
aged
a
bit
longer
but
im
not
sure
if
id
go
as
far
as
next
winter
and
im
not
sure
how
much
it
would
change
by
the
end
of
this
glad
i
opened
it
now
on
to
sitting
here
and
enjoying
it
o
another
solid
brew
from
my
favorite
indiana
brewery
overall
a
pretty
fantastic
american
barleywine
i
like
english
better
but
this
is
great
for
the
style
i
bet
bourbon
or
brandy
barrels
would
make
this
very
interesting
amber
orange
small
amount
of
beige
head
still
a
good
amount
of
pungent
hops
typical
sweet
and
sour
aroma
flavors
are
mellow
mild
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
good
amount
of
sweetness
from
the
malt
the
booze
is
well
hidden
mild
carbonation
decent
american
barley
wine
overall
very
nice
but
missing
some
fine
touches
that
would
make
it
spectacular
id
love
to
try
this
in
a
bourbon
barrel

good

at
16
per
bottle
this
is
a
very
rare
treat
at
best
but
im
still
going
to
buy
a
bottle
for
the
cellar
im
quite
curious
to
see
what
happens
when
the
hops
fade
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
hope
to
get
a
few
bottles
of
the
next
batch
to
hold
on
to
for
a
while
o
very
nice
barleywine
well
balanced
and
very
complex
there
are
multiple
layers
of
hop
and
malt
flavors
here
sweet
and
bitter
playing
off
of
each
other
quite
well
havent
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
fresh
but
seems
to
be
aging
well
balance
is
great
still
plenty
of
hops
without
dominating
and
the
layers
of
different
sugary
flavors
are
really
nice
glad
i
have
another
bottle
of
this
still
sitting
in
the
cellar
o
this
had
some
really
interesting
flavors
dancing
around
in
it
but
its
so
boozy
that
its
drinkability
is
affected
with
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
to
mellow
out
i
think
this
beer
will
be
incredible
o
this
is
by
far
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
very
nice
an
evenkeeled
critter
im
looking
forward
to
the
vertical
2008
vintage
shared
by
dave
guay
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
pours
the
color
and
clarity
of
cider
no
volume
to
the
head
just
a
soapy
skim
and
a
thin
band
around
the
shoulders
aromas
of
malt
prunes
bready
sugared
fruit
and
ethanol
comprise
the
nose
taste
follows
nose
with
the
addition
of
a
little
medicinal
bitterness
towards
the
finish
all
and
all
not
as
sweet
as
suggested
by
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
an
easy
carbonation
and
a
trace
of
acidity
at
the
finish
overall
this
beer
is
really
quite
solid
but
i
do
think
it
has
a
great
deal
more
aging
potential
id
love
to
see
this
with
another
three
years
on
it
o
this
is
very
well
made
and
very
enjoyable
complex
and
balanced
serving
type
bottle
overall
a
very
nice
barley
wine
opened
at
a
good
time
any
earlier
and
it
would
have
been
too
hot
any
later
and
it
would
have
been
too
thin
o
im
typically
not
a
fan
of
barleywines
as
they
tend
to
be
a
little
bit
too
sweet
for
me
however
this
was
a
fantastic
barleywine
that
is
very
hop
forward
but
what
else
would
you
expect
from
fff
11411
just
drank
a
bottle
of
behemoth
that
i
brought
home
from
3f
and
love
it
even
more
really
has
move
to
the
top
of
my
list
for
favorite
barleywines
along
with
stone
og
great
beer
and
a
must
try
if
you
get
a
chance
overall
a
very
solid
barleywine
here
incredibly
balanced
between
hops
and
malt
perfect
for
a
chilly
evening
very
good
beer
by
fff
would
love
to
try
this
after
a
few
years
will
definitely
be
finding
a
bottle
to
try
after
aging
a
really
nice
american
barleywine
this
one
is
done
up
how
i
like
em
i
guess
my
tastes
are
trained
to
really
enjoy
something
like
this
im
not
sure
how
the
barrel
aged
version
would
turn
out
im
inclined
to
say
that
this
beer
wouldnt
be
a
candidate
for
the
charred
and
oaky
flavors
of
bourbon
barrels
also
at
this
point
id
also
guess
that
a
fresher
bottle
of
this
would
be
better
that
tropical
fruitiness
is
this
beers
selling
point
at
this
juncture
we
have
nearly
a
whole
vertical
lined
up
so
ill
make
that
call
soon
and
the
lacing
this
isnt
rings
of
foam
its
coating
the
entire
glass
cheers
deuce
to
tulip
appearance
the
most
arbitrary
category
is
good
deep
amber
with
little
head
smell
is
great
for
a
barleywine
probably
the
best
bouquet
of
any
unadulterated
version
excludes
barrelaged
bws
tastes
great
too
everything
youd
expect
from
a
3
floyds
brew
alcohol
is
present
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
mouthfeel
is
good
while
i
dont
subtract
points
from
the
heat
of
the
abv
in
the
taste
category
it
cost
them
slightly
in
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
wont
be
drinking
too
often
because
of
the
17bomber
price
i
enjoyed
the
caramel
of
this
barleywine
this
is
everything
that
i
enjoy
about
barleywines
without
the
intense
sweetness
that
some
examples
of
this
style
have
overall
behemoth
is
more
basic
than
i
anticipated
but
still
a
satisfying
sipper
nonetheless
despite
the
claims
that
this
beer
is
a
monstrous
complex
blast
of
humulus
lupulus
our
fresh
bottle
was
quite
tame
and
about
as
hoppy
as
most
aged
us
barleywines
i
enjoyed
contemplating
this
tasty
and
wellconstructed
beer
however
dont
go
into
it
expecting
a
hop
bomb
skål
overall
a
great
brew
probably
not
worth
the
17
price
tag
but
still
a
great
brew
that
is
worth
picking
up
at
least
once
o
overall
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
cant
wait
to
see
what
a
couple
years
of
age
does
to
this
one
still
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
fff
overall
another
exceptional
beer
by
three
floyds
im
not
sure
how
true
to
the
style
this
one
is
but
i
enjoyed
it
nonetheless
im
certainly
going
to
pick
up
a
bottle
if
i
happen
to
spot
this
on
the
shelves
somewhere
o
overall
very
powerful
brew
i
prefer
this
one
with
some
age
on
it
o
this
is
very
hopped
up
and
very
sweet
but
it
is
still
good
and
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
more
than
i
remember
the
body
is
a
hazy
copper
to
the
point
of
being
opaque
with
orange
hues
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
about
an
inch
of
foamy
tan
head
grows
before
receding
quickly
to
a
patch
of
bubbles
that
remains
throughout
the
drink
smells
of
hazelnut
caramel
malt
faint
wheat
and
rye
and
dark
fruits
tastes
similar
with
an
emphasis
on
the
hazelnut
malts
wheat
and
an
almost
woody
taste
initial
thoughts
suggest
a
gin
barrel
as
there
are
some
pineyjuniper
undertones
sugar
and
straw
flavors
finish
this
beer
mouth
is
smooth
and
crisp
held
together
by
a
dry
caramel
finish
overall
a
great
beer
with
just
the
right
amount
of
age
on
it
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
wish
the
ba
version
wasnt
complete
unobtanium
o
i
have
three
more
of
these
in
various
vintage
years
now
what
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
mix
detracts
just
a
little
from
the
mouthfeel
but
it
is
not
overpowering
might
be
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
will
do
my
best
to
grab
a
couple
more
these
and
age
i
expect
it
will
only
get
better
o
decent
but
not
my
favorite
o
excellent
beer
three
floyds
you
have
done
it
again
very
good
drinkability
given
the
abv
an
ipa
barleywine
a
nice
twist
on
the
barlywine
style
only
complaint
is
a
its
a
little
too
sweet
o
at
this
point
i
feel
that
3
floyds
can
do
no
wrong
a
nice
barleywine
with
3
floyds
trademark
hoppy
flavor
would
like
to
try
different
vintages
and
see
how
this
changes
with
age
2192011
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
for
a
beer
this
big
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
more
lush
and
fullbodied
but
it
seems
a
little
wan
that
said
this
is
a
very
impressive
barleywine
and
one
i
would
readily
pick
up
if
it
were
distributed
here
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
not
the
best
barleywine
i
have
ever
had
but
extremely
complex
and
delicious
despite
the
3
years
of
age
i
usually
only
like
a
year
or
2
max
on
this
style
but
this
is
still
more
than
acceptable
no
deteriorationoxidation
whatsoever
recommended
to
sample
at
least
once
in
your
beer
drinking
lifetime
one
freshone
aged
i
have
had
the
aged
one
now
so
now
i
have
to
have
acquiresample
one
fresh
gfunk
overall
this
is
a
great
barley
wine
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
it
after
it
has
23
years
on
it
its
a
must
have
go
get
some
i
dont
know
if
i
have
any
right
to
review
this
beer
i
cant
describe
it
properly
this
beer
smells
and
tastes
like
the
best
candy
youve
ever
had
cant
place
any
of
the
flavors
or
smells
awesome
sipper
full
mouthfeel
cant
kill
this
quickly
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
i
was
expecting
abv
is
noticeable
but
not
over
powering
to
the
rest
of
the
beer
overall
this
is
amazing
totally
blown
away
sorry
i
couldnt
do
it
any
justice
in
my
description
it
just
tates
like
liquid
candy
thats
the
best
i
can
do
beautiful
beer
o
this
beer
screams
to
be
aged
fresh
its
so
aggressive
and
over
the
top
sit
on
it
a
few
years
and
then
enjoy
25
on
tap
at
the
uchicago
pub
in
may
2011
my
goblet
was
a
deep
amber
translucent
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
becoming
darker
up
towards
the
one
finger
white
head
this
beer
quite
wowed
mea
really
pleasant
sweetness
of
melon
peach
and
grapefruit
caramel
malts
and
a
nice
bitter
herbalcitric
hoppiness
balancing
that
i
was
glad
that
this
wasnt
just
a
hop
assault
but
rather
deliciousness
in
a
glass
with
a
filling
mouthfeel
that
finishes
very
dry
a
very
well
balanced
well
crafted
american
barleywine
this
barleywines
got
big
flavors
but
its
lacking
in
complexity
its
good
stuff
though
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
would
go
a
long
way
toward
smoothing
the
alcohol
out
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
good
deal
it
didnt
wow
me
in
any
category
but
its
such
a
well
puttogether
american
barleywine
bitter
but
not
to
distraction
that
i
have
to
rate
it
higher
overall
than
each
of
the
individual
parts
this
is
a
great
barleywine
fresh
or
with
a
couple
years
of
age
on
it
for
me
a
world
class
brew
nice
barleywine
very
thick
barely
offwhite
head
not
as
hoppy
as
expected
from
a
3fs
beer
but
that
is
a
bonus
in
this
case
this
was
a
2009
bottle
and
it
would
have
aged
several
more
years
imo
im
thinking
about
trying
to
procure
some
verticals
overall
worth
a
4
trade
if
you
find
some
and
older
vintages
should
do
well
poured
as
a
really
pretty
amber
color
nice
lacing
thin
white
head
candied
sugar
and
hops
on
the
nose
makes
this
beer
smell
great
taste
of
sweet
malts
and
lots
of
hops
nicely
balanced
barley
wine
dry
mouthfeel
not
overly
heavy
which
is
surprising
for
the
amount
of
flavor
this
has
overall
this
was
probably
my
favorite
beer
i
had
while
i
was
visiting
the
brewpub
there
on
tap
at
fff
brewpub
sweet
malt
with
some
citrus
aftertaste
the
alcohol
really
shows
itself
here
in
this
beer
beer
is
very
smooth
needs
to
be
sipped
not
the
best
barley
wine
ive
had
but
enjoyable
i
have
had
the
2008
version
and
it
is
better
then
the
on
tap
one
highly
drinkable
overall
remarkably
mellow
brew
for
a
10
5
bw
nothing
here
to
scare
away
a
barleywine
newbi
might
be
a
good
recommendation
as
a
craft
lovers
first
steps
into
the
style
loved
this
barleywine
ive
had
too
many
barleywines
that
ive
felt
are
overly
sweet
17
99
is
a
little
pricey
for
this
bomber
but
definitely
worth
purchasing
to
treat
a
friend
to
think
that
ive
bought
many
bottles
of
this
for
others
but
this
is
my
first
this
bottle
was
shared
with
zep9865
08
vintage
purple
wax
it
poured
a
cherry
wood
in
color
with
a
light
off
white
head
that
laced
the
glass
the
aromas
are
very
sweet
there
is
a
nice
mixture
of
sweet
malt
cherries
candied
fruit
and
it
has
a
resinous
hop
aroma
that
i
definitely
dig
there
is
a
light
alcohol
aroma
present
on
the
back
end
the
flavors
are
very
sweet
fruits
initially
its
almost
syrupy
it
reminds
me
of
toffee
a
toffee
and
citrus
blend
which
is
definitely
interesting
but
still
flavorful
and
tasty
that
resinous
factor
comes
into
play
again
and
the
hops
come
alive
it
is
a
little
sweet
but
that
should
be
expected
of
a
barleywine
that
is
roughly
three
years
and
three
months
old
its
a
little
sticky
on
the
palate
but
is
a
fine
drink
this
is
a
top
notch
barleywine
and
a
fun
beer
to
try
aged
o
really
crosses
the
border
between
what
a
barleywine
and
a
dipa
should
be
much
thicker
sweeter
and
malt
forward
than
your
typical
dipa
but
still
in
the
same
territory
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
dark
fruit
malty
and
a
small
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
dryness
of
brown
sugar
hints
of
fruit
and
a
mix
of
pine
and
citrus
hops
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
pine
and
hint
of
citrus
in
the
aftertaste
not
as
boozy
as
i
thought
it
would
be
and
a
nice
hop
presence
update
just
had
a
bottel
behemoth
22
oz
2008
purple
wax
this
one
is
sweeter
little
bit
of
hops
are
stil
present
low
but
enough
carbonation
nice
white
head
nice
lacing
very
good
o
all
in
all
this
is
a
nice
offshoot
to
the
barleywine
family
not
a
true
american
too
hoppy
for
english
and
no
where
near
a
wheatwine
behemoth
creates
a
style
in
its
own
very
nice
when
i
think
of
barleywines
i
envision
a
dark
ruby
beer
that
is
rich
in
malts
and
sweetness
behemoth
2011
is
almost
the
anti
barleywine
in
a
good
way
first
it
has
a
lighter
complexion
with
a
hoppy
nose
that
peaks
the
drinkers
curiosity
upon
the
first
taste
it
seems
more
like
a
double
ipa
than
a
barleywine
with
an
abv
of
10
5
behemoth
is
very
smooth
and
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
exactly
what
a
barleywine
should
be
rich
and
expansive
behemoths
finish
is
extraordinarily
barleywie
complex
with
a
great
sweetness
and
very
malty
3
floyds
has
once
again
impressed
with
their
ability
to
reinvent
expectation
enjoy
responsibly
this
barley
wine
is
characteristically
different
mostly
because
it
has
a
very
hoppy
nose
this
is
a
beer
that
is
very
enjoyable
and
definitely
a
conversation
piece
immediately
by
its
nose
one
would
not
think
of
it
as
a
barley
wine
but
a
sweet
hoppy
pale
ale
or
high
abv
ipa
the
color
is
darker
than
a
standard
blonde
but
carries
with
it
a
much
lighter
complexion
than
a
standard
barley
wine
the
nose
is
sweet
and
full
of
aroma
the
taste
and
mouth
feel
are
thick
and
full
of
robust
sweetness
and
hops
the
finish
is
strong
but
there
is
not
much
length
but
it
leaves
you
with
wanting
more
this
is
a
beer
that
is
enjoyable
and
surprising
to
the
taste
buds
o
overall
this
has
not
changed
much
in
the
past
3
years
it
has
mellowed
a
touch
but
not
tons
considering
the
amount
of
time
it
is
a
very
drinkable
barleywine
especially
for
the
alcohol
content
it
lacks
the
overall
intensity
and
excitement
i
like
to
see
in
my
barleywines
a
bit
boring
it
does
not
have
the
complexity
i
like
to
see
either
i
would
not
pass
this
up
if
offered
to
me
because
it
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
would
not
seek
this
one
out
again
i
liked
this
a
little
more
fresh
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
well
balanced
surprisingly
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
this
was
a
very
nice
barelywine
though
i
would
like
to
see
what
this
would
be
like
with
just
a
bit
more
age
to
mellow
the
hops
and
booziness
out
just
a
tad
more
drink
and
overall
very
drinkable
like
i
previously
mentioned
one
of
the
best
straight
barley
wine
styles
i
have
encountered
highly
drinkable
not
overly
sticky
and
the
abv
is
not
overly
present
this
is
a
world
class
barleywine
great
to
try
but
it
is
a
pricy
one
2010
vintage
chilled
but
let
this
one
warm
up
a
bit
color
is
a
mix
of
deep
amber
red
mixed
with
apricot
light
carbonation
with
minimal
head
but
persists
great
earthy
hop
presence
in
the
nose
a
hallmark
of
3
floyds
also
dried
fruit
toasted
malts
but
the
hops
do
it
for
me
full
palate
like
jello
extremely
wellrounded
and
smooth
dried
fruit
toasted
malt
and
wood
finishes
dry
with
earthypiney
hops
that
linger
some
alcohol
presence
but
not
in
the
taste
for
me
the
hop
presence
definitely
edges
other
barley
wines
ive
tried
now
its
time
to
pick
up
another
bottle
and
let
it
sit
for
a
few
years
d
pretty
good
but
strong
id
try
again
and
order
another
but
have
mixed
feelings
about
buying
a
22
for
15
overall
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
tried
this
beer
and
it
happens
to
be
the
first
barleywine
i
have
enjoyed
maybe
my
palate
is
finally
accepting
to
the
style
after
not
trying
one
for
a
few
months
they
used
to
be
palate
overload
going
to
have
to
go
back
and
try
some
of
the
cheaper
and
more
attainable
options
again
overall
an
excellent
aroma
but
the
flavor
is
just
above
average
sent
down
by
dirts
been
hanging
on
to
this
one
for
awhile
now
wow
count
me
impressed
by
behemoth
it
is
eminently
drinkable
for
a
huge
beer
how
is
it
so
sweet
at
first
but
so
dry
at
the
end
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
and
probably
hurt
a
lot
afterward
this
is
perhaps
the
best
barleywine
that
ive
had
i
really
love
three
floyds
beers
di
wish
this
were
a
little
maltier
though
regardless
of
the
declared
style
this
is
an
expertly
balanced
beer
d
the
beer
is
okay
the
alcohol
is
poorly
concealed
im
disappointed
too
sweet
for
a
fresh
barleywine
i
can
see
why
many
enjoy
the
beer
presuming
those
who
like
this
also
find
hopslam
and
twohearted
pliny
to
be
the
best
of
the
best
out
there
sweet
cant
say
its
for
me
though
sound
nortt
til
gravens
vi
this
was
the
first
beer
i
imbibed
at
the
brewpub
after
a
long
road
trip
from
traverse
city
mi
it
turned
out
to
be
a
great
first
choice
and
i
feel
lucky
we
got
to
try
it
since
they
were
sold
out
of
bottles
and
the
waitress
said
this
was
some
of
the
last
of
this
years
production
it
really
blew
me
away
with
its
aromas
flavors
and
wonderful
mouthfeel
and
found
it
to
be
quite
drinkable
i
really
hope
i
can
get
my
hands
on
some
again
next
you
to
compare
excellent
but
needing
a
few
years
from
the
current
vintage
2011
i
was
lucky
enough
to
get
one
bottle
of
this
but
i
really
wish
i
could
get
it
fresh
in
all
of
its
hop
glory
d
drinkablity
is
really
good
it
is
a
pretty
high
dollar
bottle
but
its
a
nice
beer
to
try
going
to
get
a
few
more
to
age
d
seems
more
like
an
aged
dipa
to
me
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
american
barleywines
but
i
thought
a
year
of
age
or
more
would
really
help
round
this
out
ive
got
a
2008
still
aging
so
thatll
be
the
final
test
for
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
beer
more
9
50
for
32oz
for
a
growler
is
much
more
doable
than
16
99
for
22oz
thats
a
bit
steep
for
my
everyday
drinker
and
does
affect
my
rating
this
is
the
first
time
ive
seen
it
on
tap
and
if
it
does
show
up
again
i
may
be
able
to
handle
0
30
an
oz
rather
than
0
77
overall
another
quality
offering
from
fff
this
is
a
great
beer
i
love
it
fresh
with
the
hops
really
potent
in
my
experience
this
beer
is
best
fresh
or
after
2
years
it
has
a
dumb
phase
in
between
that
i
dont
care
for
as
much
md
easily
drinkable
very
sweet
and
not
as
much
alcohol
as
i
expected
there
to
be
a
tasty
brew
drinkable
sure
as
long
as
youre
sitting
on
a
stool
for
a
while
2010
bottle
green
wax
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
dimpled
mug
deep
slightly
hazed
amber
pour
with
a
thin
and
creamy
beige
cap
the
aroma
drips
with
fruitiness
from
mango
to
peaches
to
apricot
to
pear
also
in
the
nose
bready
caramel
malts
some
alcohol
and
a
massive
amount
of
hops
but
it
is
the
tropical
fruit
note
that
makes
this
really
special
taste
includes
loads
of
fresh
tropical
fruit
like
mango
melon
and
other
fruits
piney
bitter
hops
balance
perfectly
and
lead
to
sweet
caramel
towards
the
finish
with
the
alcohol
not
all
that
detectable
chewy
resiny
finish
with
loads
of
tropical
fruit
and
lingering
bitterness
creamy
full
body
with
soft
carbonation
throughout
probably
one
of
the
best
american
barleywines
i
ever
had
as
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
style
this
beer
was
yet
another
three
floyds
hallmark
in
terms
of
flavor
great
aroma
body
use
of
sugar
in
taste
and
finish
my
only
other
barleywine
experience
is
bigfoot
so
i
still
need
to
expand
my
experience
in
this
category
the
price
would
likely
prevent
me
from
partaking
in
this
on
a
regular
basis
but
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
i
recommend
trying
this
at
least
once
again
this
is
a
sipper
not
really
what
i
expected
at
all
when
i
picked
it
up
definitely
going
to
cellar
one
for
awhile
and
revisit
to
see
if
some
of
the
hopsalcohol
fade
a
bit
not
my
favorite
but
not
bad
overall
overall
kind
of
disappointed
i
feel
like
this
is
going
to
be
a
lot
better
if
i
let
it
age
i
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
complexity
from
this
beer
this
beer
unlike
its
ba
counterpart
was
slightly
lighter
in
color
and
much
clearer
being
a
clearish
amber
color
with
a
decent
white
head
the
smell
of
this
was
strongly
of
hops
on
the
nose
im
aware
this
is
to
be
the
case
in
am
bwines
but
its
not
often
hopped
to
this
extent
the
beer
has
lots
of
citrusy
hops
on
the
palate
that
actually
mostly
cover
up
the
malty
background
though
a
caramel
like
flavor
does
find
its
way
though
to
make
its
presence
known
there
is
significant
bitterness
with
this
beer
heck
ive
had
ipas
that
were
less
bitter
than
this
overall
it
was
balanced
enough
and
drinkable
i
must
admit
this
was
a
very
good
beer
and
here
our
three
floyds
brewpub
experience
comes
to
an
end
good
times
had
by
all
believe
you
me
this
capper
pours
a
clear
sunrise
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
glowing
offwhite
foam
i
wouldnt
go
so
far
as
to
call
this
blonde
by
any
stretch
but
shes
pretty
nonetheless
the
nose
comprises
ruby
red
grapefruit
leek
lightish
pine
and
sweet
sweet
toffee
the
taste
does
not
strive
to
deviate
from
this
predetermined
path
though
the
grapefruit
is
slightly
intensified
and
some
mandarin
orange
syrup
seeps
in
as
well
the
body
is
a
heavyleaning
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nearly
chewy
feel
overall
a
solid
bwine
that
somehow
doesnt
overdo
it
on
either
the
hops
or
the
malts
right
on
son
drinkability
overall
it
feels
like
a
bigger
fuller
more
maltcomplex
iipa
from
fff
i
like
it
now
and
will
probably
like
it
more
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
fade
very
aggressive
american
barleywine
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
feel
that
the
age
has
done
this
beer
a
lot
of
good
though
i
have
never
had
it
fresh
the
malt
is
surprisingly
complex
for
how
pale
it
is
and
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
much
more
sweet
im
glad
it
is
not
perhaps
not
worth
the
cost
but
good
drinkability
so
surprised
to
like
this
not
normally
a
barleywine
fan
but
fff
really
nailed
the
style
for
me
not
hot
or
tough
to
drink
at
all
think
ill
open
another
one
in
a
year
or
two
to
see
how
its
changed
drinkability
yea
i
would
definitely
sip
this
for
a
while
it
is
quite
enjoyable
very
sweet
and
hoppy
so
i
am
intrigued
to
see
how
this
would
age
d
for
something
much
sweeter
than
i
typically
like
it
was
an
excellent
drink
the
abv
does
creep
up
on
you
but
is
masked
throughout
well
going
to
have
to
open
up
my
2008
to
compare
here
sometime
soon
bought
a
bottle
to
age
as
well
drinkability
behemoth
is
a
great
slowsipper
i
had
it
on
a
night
after
a
long
day
the
weather
outside
was
below
freezing
this
seemed
an
appropriate
time
for
the
beer
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
but
i
dont
see
it
as
an
everyday
drinker
it
struck
me
as
a
terrific
treat
beer
maybe
it
was
the
sweetness
that
prompted
such
overall
a
decent
bwine
but
i
do
want
to
try
this
fresh
i
imagine
it
being
a
lot
hoppier
the
hops
do
seem
a
bit
faded

poured
into
a
tulip
clear
amber
body
with
about
a
finger
of
off
white
head
that
dies
down
leaving
sticky
lace
along
the
glass
really
fruity
nose
really
reminds
me
of
strawberries
mixed
with
dark
fruits
malty
notes
and
carmel
undertones
round
out
a
sweet
aroma
good
deep
malt
flavors
on
this
one
musty
cellar
flavors
supported
by
dark
rich
fruits
and
carmel
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
good
enjoyable
full
body
on
this
guy
and
carbonation
is
great
its
a
bit
hot
though
im
digging
this
but
its
a
bit
boozy
i
dont
mind
sipping
on
this
guy
though
this
one
exceeded
my
expectations
might
have
to
seek
out
another
bottle
some
time
the
leadoff
here
is
alcohol
and
sweetness
giving
way
in
the
midpalate
to
the
pine
hops
the
hops
are
strong
in
flavor
and
force
the
palate
to
experience
them
burying
the
alcohol
significantly
i
suppose
this
is
one
strategy
to
cover
up
alcohol
i
wonder
how
this
ages
d
best
enjoyed
in
small
quantities
this
is
a
great
bottle
to
share
a
few
ways
yellow

brown
with
some
caramel
coloring
when
held
up
to
the
light
12
cream
colored
head
with
some
yellow
in
it
kind
of
looks
like
the
wax
on
the
bottle
smells
of
raisins
toast
and
just
the
faintest
hint
of
pine
rich
and
complex
flavors
of
raisin
bread
caramel
touch
of
alcohol
molassas
and
piney
hops
kind
of
has
a
spicy
finish
i
really
like
how
this
beers
flavors
just
linger
awhile
thick
mouthfeel
with
some
kick
yet
still
smooth
for
a
barleywine
this
is
incredibily
drinkable
nice
to
sit
and
sip
at
the
fireplace
while
watching
a
good
movie
great
version
of
an
american
barleywine
2009
bottle
poured
into
snifter
is
a
bright
orange
with
reddish
hues
small
off
white
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
smells
of
toffee
caramel
fruity
hops
fresh
butter
overall
pretty
subtle
tastes
like
biscuit
malts
a
sharp
hop
bitterness
a
bit
roasty
some
alcohol
dried
fruits
slightly
herbal
finish
heavy
body
with
a
light
carbonation
slightly
coating
drinkability
is
good
but
there
is
enough
alcohol
heat
in
the
finish
that
takes
some
points
away
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
i
would
like
to
try
one
with
3
or
more
years
on
it
d
very
easy
drinking
barleywine
very
sweet
though
maybe
a
touch
too
sweet
for
my
liking
i
could
actually
use
a
litte
more
hops
to
balance
out
some
of
that
sweetness
d
damn
fine
barleywine
in
my
book
ive
never
had
this
fresh
but
after
1
years
of
aging
it
tastes
delicious
alcohol
was
not
much
of
an
issue
but
i
did
split
the
bottle
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
barleywine
for
the
surprising
balance
abv
is
higher
but
still
very
good
beer
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
ab
out
there
solid
offering
from
three
floyds
while
there
are
many
attributes
that
can
be
enjoyed
the
one
worth
talking
about
is
the
alcohol
at
12
5
the
booze
is
almost
nonexistent
there
is
no
doubt
age
helped
mellow
the
flavors
out
but
a
certainly
level
of
craftsmanship
is
needed
to
produce
a
product
such
as
this
tremendously
drinkable
given
the
abv
behemoth
is
not
on
the
top
of
my
list
of
beers
to
try
again
but
i
will
certainly
seek
it
out
in
the
future
her
heft
is
striking
her
balance
insufferable
she
is
my
warrior
princess
of
the
midwest
d
drink
it
okay
buy
it
perhaps
at
a
deep
discount
pretty
good
even
for
it
being
high
in
alcohol
only
thing
setting
it
back
would
be
the
price
i
will
definitely
grab
this
again
however
would
like
to
try
it
fresh
from
the
tap
at
the
brewpub
as
well
d
althought
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
say
on
the
drinkability
it
was
very
average
i
dont
think
this
is
the
most
amazing
barelywine
but
definitely
worth
a
try
smooth
easy
to
drink
but
a
little
more
bitter
then
expected
very
nice
just
a
little
expensive
mouthfeel
is
relatively
light
for
a
12
5
barleywine
although
it
is
a
blonde
which
would
counteract
any
thickness
you
might
be
expecting
very
light
on
carbonation
nearly
flat
but
still
pretty
good
very
smooth
going
down
all
in
all
this
is
an
ok
brew
not
great
but
good
dont
bother
hunting
but
ok
to
try
if
you
like
a
hoppy
barleywine
d
i
think
this
beer
is
at
its
prime
time
to
drink
up
if
you
have
this
color
wax
wish
i
had
a
couple
more
to
be
honest
a
nice
mellowed
out
american
barleywine
pours
a
golden
redamber
with
about
23
fingers
of
head
which
dies
pretty
quickly
great
lacing
and
a
perfect
amount
of
carb
for
this
style
smells
are
sweet
caramel
malts
slight
hop
brown
sugar
and
some
raisins
tastes
sweet
at
front
with
some
earthy
tones
dark
fruit
hops
at
the
end
then
a
sweet
carameltoffee
finish
wow
this
is
amazing
mouthfeel
is
slightly
chewy
good
carb
feels
great
to
me
drinkability
is
very
high
for
a
barleywine
but
then
again
i
love
barleywines
i
really
wish
i
would
have
picked
up
a
case
of
this
when
i
saw
it
on
sale
for
13bottle
this
beer
is
aces
taste
light
caramel
sweetness
forms
a
base
shifting
towards
toffee
and
burnt
sugar
in
the
finish
cherry
flashes
in
and
out
adding
some
dimension
alcohol
is
surprisingly
restrained
for
such
a
big
gal
but
it
certainly
does
flex
warming
and
fruitiness
faded
hops
are
more
assertive
than
one
would
guess
from
the
aroma
providing
a
low
to
moderate
bitterness
that
makes
itself
apparent
in
the
finish
which
coupled
with
the
bittersweet
dark
caramel
flavors
provide
some
semblance
of
balance
bottle
2008
release
nice
sweet
malty
backbone
with
sugary
notes
of
caramel
and
some
hint
of
fruity
citrus
hops
this
barley
wine
is
so
well
balanced
in
my
opinion
the
alcohol
is
just
barely
traceable
but
that
doesnt
make
it
any
less
drinkable
mediumfull
body
with
an
oily
mouthfeel
warm

comforting
behemoth
is
a
good
barleywine
and
im
happy
to
have
tried
it

i
can

i
have
in
my
cellar

a
year
or
two
now

that
leaves
light
lace
around
the
glass
nose
of
sweet

with
citrus
and
herbal

and
some

the
hops
really
take
over
on
the

leaving
the
sweetness
and
malts
on
the
back

the
body
is
full
with
light
carbonation
and
a
long
caramelized
and
super
hoppy
finish
in
the
words
of
ron
burgundy
its
so
damn
hot
barleywine
was
a
bad
choice
so
yeah
maybe
i
didnt
pick
the
best
hot
and
sunny
saturday
afternoon
to
crack
this
one
open
despite
that
getting
through
this
bomber
wasnt
much
of
a
struggle
overall
just
a
super
solid
and
very
well
put
together
bwine
i
could
have
drank
this
one
all
day
had
my
eye
on
this
one
for
about
89
years
now
patience
pays
off
it
showed
up
at
discount
liquor
in

i
nabbed

fairly

that
is
like
flavor
despite
massiveness
and
strength
dont
really
pick
up
much
alcohol
of
this
beer
could
almost
qualify
it
as
a

incredible
american
barley
wine
three
floyds
produces
nothing
less
than
outstanding
beers
and
this
offering
merely
reaffirms
my
love
for
their
products
if
there
is
a
barleywine
out
there
better
then
this
one
i
have
yet
to
try
it
d
10
isnt
crazy
huge
but
the
beer
goes
down
pretty
well
there
really
isnt
an
alcohol
impact
with
this
beer
the
taste
is
so
big
with
hops
it
doesnt
even
allow
the
alcohol
to
appear
nice
flavor
great
body
but
the
price
and
abv
kill
this
a
bit
i
would
buy
this
again
though
id
love
to
try
it
fresh
overall
a
very
good
bwine
sweet
and
hoppy
but
neither
are
overwhelming
although
i
like
american
my
bwines
hoppy
this
is
what
i
expected
aged
i
think
this
would
be
a
fun
vertical
to
do
although
at
18
99
for
a
bomber
im
not
sure
i
can
justify
buying
anymore
than
1year
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
moderately
low
it
has
a
bit
of
a
silky
and
creamy
feel
to
it
as
well
the
drinkability
is
decent
it
had
some
very
nice
malty
flavors
to
it
the
alcohol
hurts
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
but
not
too
bad
overall
i
liked
it
a
lot
d
very
drinkable
for
a
high
abv
barleywine
i
thought
the
alcohol
was
hidden
well
and
really
enjoyed
the
smooth
caramel
malts
would
be
interested
to
see
how
it
ages
as
well
would
be
curious
to
see
how
well
this
one
ages
in
any
event
even
as
a
baby
this
is
a
very
impressive
and
enjoyable

this
was
an
ok
barleywine
but
not
a
favorite
d
this
beer
is
a
homerun
excellent
barlywine
that
i
am
really
happy
i
got
to
try
well
balanced
and
smooth
excellent
beer
that
ill
be
looking
for
again
d
i
want
to
put
some
time
into
the
next
one
of
these
i
try
this
was
still
pretty
hot
and
it
took
away
from
the
flavor
profiles
i
shared
this
one
and
my
half
was
all
i
really
cared
to
drink
it
was
good
but
a
cpl
years
would
do
this
one
wonders
not
really
a
drinkable
beer
but
hey
its
a
barleywine
although
it
goes
down
smooth
i
would
suggest
you
sip
this
one
and
possibly
even
share
it
with
a
friend
overall
this
was
a
very
wellcrafted
american
barleywine
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
again
thanks
clint

it

another
masterpiece
from
the
hugely
talented
brewmasters
at

an
asking
price
of
15
99
is
pretty
steep
that
doesnt
mean
that
i
wont
continue
to
buy
at
least
one
bottle
from
every
release
d
warm
alcohol
and
massive
malts
with
a
somewhat
balanced
finish
a

warm
and
powerful
though
best

with
someone
and
sipped
on
a
cold
day
the
09
was
hands
down
the
best
this
one
doesnt
seem
to
age
well
and
really
just
dives
off
the
cliff
after
a
couple
years
i
really
enjoyed
the
09
thought
this
is
similar
to
big
foot
at
first
with
lots
of
hops
and
bitterness
to
add
to
the
nice
barleywine
sweet
maltiness
but
doesnt
age
like
bigfoot
instead
just
stinks
up
the
place
ill
do
my
grading
based
off
the
09
version
as
it
is
fresh
and
tasted
the
best
2009
vintage
this
poured
a
nearly
clear
dark
gold
with
a
bit
of
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
toffee
and
butterscotch
and
succulent
orange
with
pineapple
and
a
bit
of
bready
yeast
and
alcohol
it
tasted
like
orange
and
candied
pineapple
and
toffee
with
some
grapefruit
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
it
was
slightly
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
clean
and
balanced
beer
it
hid
the
alcohol
decently
too
so
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
this
could
definitely
improve
with
age
also
but
was
quite
enjoyable
fresh
this
wasnt
quite
good
enough
to
claim
top
spot
as
my
favorite
barleywine
ever
but
it
was
still
excellent
another
hit
from
fff
i
love
american
style
barleywines
like
old
guardian
bigfoot
old
ruffian
mirror
mirror
old
horizontal
and
old
numbskull
just
to
name
a
few
behemoth
is
a

aromas

fruity

flavor
is
fruity
with
a
lot
of
caramel
and
the
a
bitter
homage
to
the
hops
that
used
to
be
in
this
beer
im
guessing
it
was
a
vintage
bottle
very
full
body
sweet
and
thick
and
bitter
good
beer
fairly
drinkable
considering
the
style
this
one
is
probably
better
fresh
as
it
is
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
some
more
complexity
would
be
appreciated
a
complex
hoppy
though
firm
malty
barleywine
with
a
distinct
fff
character
one
to
sip
as
a
long
nightcap
pillowy
smooth
mouthfeel
silks
round
the
mouth
abv
no
where
to
be
found
which
is
impressive
for
a
12
beer
still
cant
imagine
seeking
this
out
again
not
a
terrible
or
even
a
bad
beer
just
that
theres
other
lessdiabetes
causing
beers
out
there
i
havent
had
this
beer
fresh
yetnow
i
need
to
so
i
have
a
compareson
for
this
aged
one
im
so
glad
i
have
another
yellow
seal
in
the
cellar
i
cant
speak
for
this
beer
fresh
but
go
buy
some
and
forget
about
them
for
a
while
this
is
the
best
barley
wine
ive
ever
tried
this
would
be
amazingly
drinkable
at
any
abv
never
mind
12

ridiculous
i
cant
wait
to
get
more
d
aging
would
be
great
in
a
bottle
but
i
have
to
say
that
im
very
impressed
with
this
beer
definitely
a
big
beer
and
one
of
the
best
american
barleywines
ive
had
the
drinkability
isnt
perfect
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
but
the
lack
of
a
rubbing
alcohol
flavor
really
helps
this
beer
a
lot
btw
this
is
rated
at

at
the
brewery
taste
is
amazing
no
booze
at
all
on
the
taste
its

really
solid

very
malty

edit
i
had
the
2009
behemoth
blue
wax
at
a
tasting
in
april
2010
i
was
still
underwhelmed
having
the
2007
next
to
perfect
storm
wasnt
the
issue
its
just
not
an
upper
tier
barleywine
very
middle
of
the
pack
if
you
get
the
chance
to
make
it
to
dld
make
sure
you
check
out
the
barrel
aged
incarnations
of
this
as
well
drinkability
gets
knocked
a
notch
only
for
such
a
high
abv
other
than
that
this
is

fine
crafted
american

j
2008

jan
2010
this
one
pours
a
clear
amber
color
there
was
a
couple
of
fingers
of
a
beige
head
on
mine
that
dropped
away
rather
quickly
lots
of
pine
to
the
nose
still
an
overall
sweetness
comes
to
the
top
also
fruits
pear
caramel
malts
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
oooohhh
this
is
smooth
a
nice
balance
of
the
bitterness
and
sweetness
it
is
a
touch
sweet
to
the
finish
caramel
and
some
pine
flavors
some
fruits
in
there
but
in
the
background
fairly
full
bodied
this
is
really
excellent
d
this
could
certainly
use
some
aging
but
i
liked
it
a
lot
the
look
kind
of
threw
me
off
but
it
really
comes
together
even
mouthfeel
full
with
moderate
carbonation
very
tasty
beer
drinkable
but
a
sipper
thanks
to
autumnaldave
for
this
lovely
beer
from
a
yearsgoneby
trade
its
big
it
has
character
and
its
not
for
everyday
but
on
thanksgiving
it
was
perfect
sweet
aroma
caramel
fruit
and
a
bit
of
citrus
pours
to
a
thin

aroma
is
very
well
balanced
of

malts
and
small
sweet
notes

some

dthis
is
actually
extremely
drinkable
its
big
and
smooth
not
bad
lingering
effects
from
the
alcohol
and
the
high
is
well
hidden
another
awesome
beer
from
three
floyds
man
i
wish
i
could
get
their
stuff
regularly
overall
i
have
had
this
beer
at
2yr
1yr
and
fresh
all
tastings
are
out
of
this
world
and
look
forward
to
sipping
on
my
07
next
year
at
3years
d
reasonably
drinkable
it
lets
you
know
the
alcohol
is
there
without
being
overbearing
a
pleasure
to
put
down
but
it
doesnt
leave
me
calling
for
more
as
some
brews
do
d
what
an
enjoyable
barleywine
the
complexity
of
the
taste
is
surly
one
of
the
best
ive
had
of
this
style
its
so
easy
drinking
and
smooth
its
not
overly
sweet
or
boozy
tasting
as
the
case
with
many
others
in
this
style
i
like
the
approach
to
the
palate
d
quite
drinkable
this
beer
hides
the
high
alcohol
content
very
well
i
could
drink
a
number
of
these
and
get
smashed
before
i
knew
it
the
only
problem
lies
with
the
price
at
20
a
bomber
i
can
only
drink
these
when
student
loans
come
in
the
mail
but
gosh
would
that
i
could
drink
these
all
the
time
i
suspect
that
this
wouldcould
age
incredibly
well
i
plan
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
of
this
update
in
my
opinion
this
does
not
age
well
at
all
best
consumed
fresh
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
good
bite
of
carbonation
despite
its
big
abv
this
is
a
very
nicely
done
and
well
balanced
beer
that
is
quite
easy
to
drink
id
love
to
have
more
of
this
great
beer
and
a
must
try
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
copper
with
a
nice
off
white
head
the
smell
of
glorious
hops
immediately
hits
you
and
you
know
this
is
a
barleywine
of
the
american
variety
the
smell
fades
into
some
red
fruits
and
sweet
malt
the
taste
goes
the
same
way
with
the
hops
dancing
in
the
forefront
behind
a
pretty
good
malt
base
i
only
say
pretty
good
as
im
not
a
big
fan
of
aged
behemothit
loses
the
hops
and
the
malt
isnt
complex
enough
imo
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
lucious
and
although
this
is
a
sipper
im
always
wanting
another
my
favorite
barley
wine
d
this
beer
left
me
wanting
more
but
the
12
abv
prevents
me
from
this
a
definite
sipper
edit
the
more
i
thought
about
it
and
the
more
i
drink
it
this
beer
reminded
of
another
thomas
hardys
they
taste
very
similar
thats
pretty
good
company
good
sip
ability
on
this
brew
one
glass
is
enough
in
a
sitting
but
the
glass
goes
down
mighty
fine
this
is
a
good
american
barleywine
worth
seeking
out
in
my
book
pours
a
great
deep
copper
color
with
a
nice
bit
of
light
coming
through
a
good
bit
of
head
for
a
barleywine
with
a
nice
bit
of
lacing
as
well
great
deep
malt
scent
very
sweet
with
a
hint
of
lighter
malt
great
deep
taste
horribly
malty
thick
and
sweet
like
a
good
barleywine
should
be
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
at
the
end
but
remarkably
small
for
a
3f
brew
has
a
nice
hint
of
lighter
malt
attributes
to
make
it
unique
and
different
goes
down
great
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
thick
and
great
with
no
noticable
alcohol
great
barleywine
behemoth
was
a
tough
battle
a
fine
beer
by
any
ones
reckoning
but
not
one
for
amateur
which
i
obviously
am
i
would
love
to
see
some
age
on
this
old
girl
rotation
one
and
done
on
fresh
would
try
an
aged
one
would
try
ontap
to
see
if
it
differs
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
one
id
like
to
see
with
some
age
on
it
the
components
of
this
one
definitely
need
to
introduce
themselves
get
comfy
before
this
one
comes
together
as
it
seems
it
should
d
the
ale
is
bigger
than
its
bottle
a
fantastic
barleywine
which
tastes
so
good
fresh
with
the
hops
almost
as
much
of
a
focal
point
as
the
malt
and
alcohol
a
class
act
with
an
very
smooth
drinkability
for
such
a
big
beer
well
worth
the
taste
thanks
foofaa
purple

edition
deep
amber
with
a
respectable
head
that
faded
quickly
aroma
was
citrus
as
first
and
as
behemoth
warmed
it
turned
to
the
roasted
malt
mentioned
on
the
label
in
terms
of
taste
this
was
a
tale
of
two
barleywines
too
cold
it
was
like
an
old
girlfriend
cold
and
bitter
after
warming
up
a
bit
it
was
also
like
an
old
girlfriend
warm
and
sweet
with
the
bitterness
only
a
distant
remembrance

feel
no

here
a

be

good
but
like
dark

youre
only
drinking
one
of
these
bad
boys
d
goes
down
great
for
the
abv
too
sweet
to
drink
quickly
or
a
lot
of
very
good
barley
wine
thanks
mike
for
helping
me
out
with
this
one
the
smell
is
a
tremendous
amount
of
hops
woth
a
sweet
malt
undertone
pours
cloudy
and
thick
with
almost
no
head
this
beer
just
screams
high
abv
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
barleywine
for
something
so
strong
slightly
oversweet
but
this
is
a
very
slight
trait
and
im
diggong
to
find
something
i
dont
like
it
might
be
a
little
overpriced
for
a
beer
but
at
12
5
its
a
party
starter
that
will
do
id
buy
it
if
it
were
available
without
me
having
to
drive
a
few
hours
it
tastes
very
smooth

i
could
drink
this
all
night
if
i
had
access
to
alot
more
of
it
superbly
well
balanced
american
barleywine
and
the
high
abv
is
well
masked
the
mouthfeel
on
this
is
a
little
slick
and
it
lingers
on
the
palate
nicely
overall
this
brew
shocked
me
w
its
great
balance
and
well
roundedness
expected
this
to
be
the
usual
over
hopped
american
barlewine
standing
on
the
line
of
being
a
dipa
which
i
usually
dont
prefer
but
that
was
definately
not
the
case
w
this
brew
excellent
work
and
attention
to
detail
by
three
floyds
this
is
a
must
try
for
any
barleywine
lover
and
will
be
sampling
again

character
very

thick

with

well
carbonated
tons

flavor
inevitably
brings
a
bit
but
overall
behemoth
is
a
truly
great
beer
this
is
quite
possibly
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
its
amazing
if
you
like
alpha
king
robert
the
bruce
pride
and
joy
rabbid
rabbit
or
anyother
of
their
stuff
you
will
love
this
drinkability
at
first
i
felt
that
the
lack
of
a
heavy
body
might
mean
that
this
was
a
barleywine
that
would
not
age
well
the
alcohol
presence
will
clearly
enable
this
one
to
last
very
different
from
most
barleywines
and
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
matures
next
time
i
come
across
a
bottle
i
plan
to
lay
it
down
for
a
few
years
this
is
a
terrific
barley
wine
not
fresh
but
age
has
probably
done
the
heat
some
good
as
its
super
layed
back
and
almost
too
easy
to
drink
i
traded
for
this
one
as
an
afterthought
in
a
big
trade
and
i
am
very
glad
i
did
a
very
nicely
balanced
barley
wine
easy
to
drink
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
d
very
good
its
almost
unbelievable
to
think
a
beer
as
potent
as
this
one
can
be
so
balanced
its
practically
flawless
rich
powerful
and
complex
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
that
pours
a
hazy
crimson
into
a
snifter
head
is
slight
and
bubbly
and
dies
quickly
some
thin
strips
of
lacing
stick
to
the
glass
smells
of
sweet
and
tart
cherries
figs
deep
caramel
malts
a
damp
earthiness
and
some
piney
and
citrusy
hops
more
dark
fruitiness
hits
the
palate
up
front
with
some
dark
chocolates
more
big
piny
hops
some
grain
and
a
squirt
of
citrus
finish
things
off
a
prolific
alcohol
heat
lingers
and
theres
some
astringency
apparent
after
a
few
drinks
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
fullbodied
and
a
little
creamy
drinkability
suffers
slightly
due
to
the
overabundance
of
alcohol
theres
not
a
lot
going
on
in
the
carbonation
department
this
one
pushes
the
limits
in
terms
of
complexity
and
alcohol
but
its
failures
are
definitely
outweighed
by
its
successes
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
silky

decent

has
fresh
citrus
hops
big

fantastic
stuff
needs
to
try
more

offerings
maybe
ill
seek
out
one
of
the
goops
next
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
shared
with
psycohops
and
brothercannon
the
bottle
is
dipped
in
bubble
gum
pink
wax
looking
at
some
old
reviews
indicates
this
is
a
2006
vintage
poured
into
a
trio
of
snifters
this
barleywine
appears
a
deep
apricot
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
dense
pillowy
light
ecru
foam
nose
and
flavor
consists
of
pineapples
tons
of
sweet
caramely
malts
the
alcohol
isnt
really
noticeable
at
this
point
but
you
can
still
tell
its
is
quite
strong
notes
of
prunes
raisins
tart
green
apples
a
hint
of
dark
cherry
are
also
present
thick
syrupy
and
full
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
to
match
the
richness
and
flavors
we
enjoyed
this
along
with
a
few
various
sharp
cheeses
grapes
and
apple
slices
d
the
alcohol
makes
this
less
drinkable
than
the
taste
averaged
score
that
being
said
theres
so
many
good
things
going
on
here
its
ridiculous
having
had
this
beer
many
times
im
almost
at
fault
for
celebrating
its
quirks
unique
and
delicious
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
and
yes
worth
the
17
to
try
if
you
still
have
a
job

deep
orange
maybe
even
copper
color
with
a
nice
tannish
head
nose
is
sticky
with
caramel
brown
sugar
and
fruits
taste
follows
the
nose
pretty
closely
mine
had
an
oxidized
taste
i
believe
it
was
taking
a
turn
for
the
worst
i
did
notice
dried
fruits
caramel
molasses
tobacco
mouthfeel
was
nice
the
abv
was
very
well
hidden
dthis
one
must
be
sipped
due
to
the
crazy
abv
but
the
alcohol
is
disguised
very
well
a
bomber
of
this
is
almost
perfect
and
i
will
definitely
return
to
it
in
the
future
and
try
some
other
barleywines
in
the
process

malt
sangria
hits
the
front
to
middle
of
taste
the
finish
highlights
the
citrus
and
mint
bitterness
that
slowly
pushes
the
malt
and
fruity
booze
out
of
the
way
the
palate
is
boozey
somewhat
syrupy
and
a
slow
interchange
of
bitter
and
fruity
a
fantastic
barley
wine
i
will
be
acquiring
more
of
this
in
the
future
it
is
however
overpriced
14
99
is
pretty
steep
for
a
bomber
poured
a
fairly
blonde
and
amber
light
amount
of
head
smells
citrusy
and
piney
with
an
undercurrent
of
alcohol
and
dark
fruit
upon
first
sip
im
slammed
with
the
hops
after
that
intial
rush
things
mellow
out
a
bit
and
become
more
complex
theres
a
very
nice
fig
sweetness
underneath
the
citrusy
hops
theres
a
definite
alcohol
afterburn
here
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
with
lots
of
thinking
to
be
had
the
mouthfeel
was
very
nice
quite
thick
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
while
its
nice
to
get
through
one
of
these
theres
no
way
on
earth
i
could
have
a
second
in
a
row
side
note
this
is
actually
closer
to
a
dipa
due
to
the
apparently
high
ibus
exactly
and
hey
for
an
iipa
id
just
say
that
i
dont
like
it
for
a
barleywine
i
say
that
the
light
fruitiness
is
not
to
style
mouthfeeldrinkability
has
a
dry
and
bitter
finish
with
very
light
carbonation
d
drink
it
i
liked
it
better
on
tap
but
the
bottles
are
still
good
of
course
on
tap
at
fffs
dark
orange
in
appearance
citrus
and
carmel
nose
a
perfect
mix
of
yummy
goodness
tastes
just
like
it
smells
carmelcitrushoppy
medium
on
the
mouth
very
smooth
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
will
sneak
up
on
you
if
youre
not
careful
always
have
a
few
bombers
onhand
while
theyre
available
drinkability
as
said
above
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
watch
out
kids
flavor
is
deliciously
sweet
but
not
cloying
enjoy
at
a
slow
pace
if
your
will
power
permits
edit
20
minutes
later
i
feel
like
ive
been
kicked
in
the
head
good
thing
i
shared
a
good
portion
of
this
one
i
cant
imagine
how
id
feel
if
i
drank
the
whole
thing
drinkability
a
fine
example
and
a
great
candidate
for
aging
behemoth
is
similar
to
a
vintage
barolo
young
its
assertive
and
fruity
supple
and
lightly
smokey
with
a
bit
of
age
it
becomes
warm
and
mellow
relative
to
experience
and
taste
it
can
be
both
dark
and
intense
or
soft
and
silky
its
ultimate
appeal
is
that
it
can
be
both
big
and
sophisticated
at
the
same
time
that
is
the
beauty
of
this
beer
and
barleywines
in
general
d
pluses
include
great
flavor
and
well
hidden
abv
negatives
are
high
carbonation
high
abv
and
price
17
drinking
a
bomber
is
no
problem
but
ponying
up
enough
cash
for
a
second
one
is
less
likely
id
love
to
try
the
barrelaged
version
again
and
review
that
called
just
behemoth
the
aroma
is
right
for
the
style
as
it
pertains
to
american
barley
wines
there
is
plenty
of
hops
more
than
many
of
the
style
but
not
more
than
seems
appropriate
it
is
both
citrusy
and
piny
there
is
also
sweet
malt
and
carrot
juice
the
appearance
is
perfect
for
the
style
with
a
larger
head
than
many
imported
barley
wines
the
flavor
is
like
the
style
with
a
bitter
finish
and
very
well
hidden
alcohol
the
palate
is
appropriate
for
the
style
overall
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
actually
its
got
some
qualities
that
i
wish
other
would
have
but
i
could
do
without
the
carrot
taste
2007
vintage
courtesy
of
gillard
pours
hazy
copper
with
lasting
tan
head
the
aroma
is
nice
and
hoppy
with
pine
hops
and
fur
tree
followed
by
sweet
mildly
roasty
malts
and
hints
of
caramel
the
taste
starts
hoppy
and
earthy
and
a
tad
thin
the
hops
come
off
as
pine
grassy
resiny
and
earthy
bitterness
wow
lots
of
hops
by
midway
the
sweet
malts
peak
in
intensity
but
quickly
get
overtaken
by
pine
and
grassy
hop
bitterness
that
run
right
into
the
after
taste
darn
smooth
really
but
would
benefit
from
several
more
years
of
aging
2005
vintage
it
pours
a
hue
darker
than
the
06
with
an
even
bolder
tan
head
the
aroma
is
much
more
barleywine
like
with
a
suitable
level
of
dark
fruity
esters
to
break
up
the
once
hop
dominated
nose
i
also
get
a
just
noticeable
caramel
note
the
taste
is
richer
with
a
bit
more
malt
caramel
notes
and
dark
fruity
esters
the
hops
are
still
over
powering
i
think
this
will
be
excellent
in
a
couple
more
years
i
now
wish
i
had
another
bottle
fff
come
to
massachusetts
for
real
review
taken
from
notes
on
monday
night
at
deep
ellum
i
was
really
surprised
to
see
this
on
as
three
floyds
does
not
distribute
to
this
area
appearance
is
a
dark
orange
with
three
fingers
of
white
heading
taking
a
long
time
to
die
down
smell
is
of
floral
hops
but
of
garlic
mango
and
other
citrus
fruits
gentle
flowery
hops
dominate
in
the
taste
with
the
malt
taking
a
backseat
alcohol
burn
is
there
in
a
very
mild
way
feel
is
on
the
medium
side
drinkability
is
superb
but
after
more
than
one
of
these
you
would
definitely
be
feeling
it
as
others
have
commented
this
beer
really
tastes
more
like
an
imperial
ipa
than
a
barleywine
at
the
same
time
sometimes
the
line
between
those
two
styles
gets
blurred
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
so
i
guess
this
is
just
a
really
hopped
up
barleywine
either
way
i
wish
it
was
here
all
the
time
head
over
to
deep
ellum
now
and
get
some
while
you
can
cheers
d
drinks
like
a
dipa
with
some
alcoholic
heat
overallthis
is
a
monster
of
a
beer
not
exactly
my
favorite
american
barley
wine
party
because
at
times
it
seemed
more
like
an
old
ale
but
definitely
something
i
want
in
my
weekly
winter
rotation
md
medium
bodied
with
a
sticky
resinous
feel
for
the
sttle
this
is
very
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
quite
the
sipper
behemoth
is
more
a
gentle
graceful
giant
my
new
secondfavorite
american
barleywine
three
floyds
has
created
a
tremendous
gem
nothing
short
of
outstanding
i
had
this
in
a
bottle
a
few
times
at
the
trion
in
new
haven
indiana
fort
wayne
area
and
just
the
other
night
on
draft
i
have
to
agree
that
this
beer
is
more
drinkable
on
draft
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
out
of
the
bottle
too
i
was
comparing
it
with
my
buddies
hopwallop
and
hopslam
and
definitely
thought
i
made
the
best
decision
it
gave
me
a
strong
notion
of
grapefruit
but
not
so
much
that
it
was
too
sour
or
bitter
the
balance
of
malt
must
have
knocked
that
down
a
bit
it
was
actually
dangerously
smooth
im
sure
if
i
didnt
know
what
i
was
drinking
i
could
have
ordered
three
or
four
and
ended
up
on
the
floor
im
high
on
barleywines
lately
and
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
top
five
ive
had
i
havent
had
a
bad
3
floyds
beer
but
this
is
one
of
their
best
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
this
beer
rereview
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
have
this
beer
on
tap
a
few
times
now
and
it
is
a
completely
different
animal
on
tap
much
better
structure
cleaner
and
discernible
taste
profile
in
short
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
made
almost
no
sense
to
me
i
liked
it
but
more
for
the
crazy
ride
it
took
my
tastebuds
on
then
for
actual
enjoying
it
on
tap
i
could
see
what
kind
of
crazy
genius
was
working
behind
the
madness
and
i
have
a
much
better
appreciation
of
the
beer
after
having
it
that
way
i
could
also
probalby
drink
2
of
them
from
tap
in
the
same
night
without
being
reduced
to
a
ball
of
goo
on
the
floor
thanks
to
crazynelson
for
the
trade
poured
a
slightly
hazy
reddishamber
with
little
to
no
head
which
i
think
is
ok
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
like
the
other
strong
amber
beers
ive
had
this
one
has
a
strong
sweet
white
bread
flavor
the
aroma
jumps
out
of
the
glass
in
a
strong
perfume
of
light
carmel
grains
bread
crust
and
honey
that
honey
continues
in
the
strondy
bready
malt
flavor
which
is
backed
up
by
a
strong
spicyhoppy
finish
thick
mouthfeel
but
a
great
beer
to
share
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
get
a
chance
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
malty
barleywines
i
remember
having
definitely
worth
a
shot
d
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
i
liked
the
fruity
flavors
very
unique
for
the
style
simply
delicious
and
i
wish
three
floyds
would
come
back
to
ohio
damn
good
this
is
a
fairly
sweet
barleywine
with
a
fading
hop
profile
that
balances
things
our
very
well
for
the
abv
its
a
crazy
drinkable
beer
very
tasty
great
brew
and
one
of
my
top
rated
active
bottled
beers
for
the
barley
wine
style
its
taking
all
my
willpower
not
to
guzzle
this
stuff
it
tastes
so
good
so
complex
yet
powerful
in
almost
every
respect
if
the
mouthfeel
were
a
bit
fuller
it
would
easily
be
a
5
even
considering
how
big
this
beer
is
really
an
amazing
beer
would
imagine
that
age
does
wonderful
things
to
this
beer
but
even
fresh
wouldnt
be
bad
either
just
really
really
intensly
hoppy
im
sure

i
had
never
heard
of
a
blonde
barleywine
previously
it
definitely
looks
and
smells
like
a
barleywinethough
the
color
is
a
bit
lighter
more
yellow
and
less
red
than
other
big
barleywines
like
bigfoot
old
guardian
or
old
crustacean
the
smell
is
very
sweet
and
its
syrupy
viscosity
is
evident
even
as
it
pours
from
the
bottle
the
light
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
ring
of
lace
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
though
i
dont
notice
the
hops
in
the
aroma
hops
are
surprisingly
pronouncedspicy
and
pineyin
the
front
of
the
taste
less
so
in
the
middle
and
finish
the
sweetness
of
the
aroma
becomes
a
candy
molasses
syrup
flavor
i
like
syrupymouthfeel
beers
but
this
one
is
too
much
for
me
i
like
big
ol
barleywines
but
this
one
is
overwhelming
the
bottle
says
its
not
normal
and
that
sums
it
up
pretty
well

fairly
rudimentary
for
a
barleywine
but
at
least
its
well
balanced
its
decent
and
certainly
a
strong
beer
but
both
the
malt
and
hop
profiles
seem
to
be
lacking
some
depth
and
definition
resulting
in
flavors
that
are
quick
lived
and
fall
flat
as
with
many
of
the
reviewers
we
agree
that
this
one
is
too
boozy
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
better
than
its
rating
it
reminds
me
of
a
cellared
bigfoot
barleywine
from
sn
the
malt
has
had
some
time
to
cut
through
all
the
hop
bitterness
but
that
bitter
hop
flavor
can
still
be
found
if
you
let
the
brew
linger
on
your
tongue
for
a
split
second
i
am
going
to
cellar
some
of
these
to
see
how
the
hop
and
malt
profiles
play
out
its
got
a
nice
alcohol
heat
but
the
rest
of
the
flavor
is
muddled
a
gentlemans
beer
dark
handsome
intelligent
confident
something
i
can
be
proud
to
drink
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
it
really
improved
my
attitude
after
a
long
day
at
the
office
even
if
youve
never
had
or
usually
dont
enjoy
this
style
i
highly
suggest
to
pick
it
up
the
beer
is
slightly
murky
with
a
chestnut
brown
body
and
a
half
inch
of
tan
head
aromas
include
toffee
dates
booze
malt
perhaps
prunes
or
raisins
thick
body
with
a
mild
but
present
sweetness
big
flavor
with
malt
complexity
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
a
nice
beer
to
sip
and
savor
overall
pretty
solid
stuff
the
booze
is
well
hidden
and
there
is
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
maybe
a
little
thin
for
a
barleywine
but
lots
of
great
flavours
a
wood
aged
version
of
this
would
be
excellent
im
sure
overall
without
having
it
fresh
this
seems
like
a
good
one
to
site
on
so
it
can
cool
not
spectacular
but
not
bad
at
less
than
3
bucks
and
11
abv
it
is
work
a
try
but
i
personally
wouldnt
buy
it
again
admittedly
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
two
barleywine
styles
o
a
solid
barleywine
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
worth
checking
out
for
sure
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
better
barleywines
out
there
lacks
complexity
this
is
more
the
looking
for
a
buzz
brew
worth
tasting
i
dont
think
i
would
keep
it

o
a
really

paired

for

with

overall
very

not

but
definitely
worth
a
taste
overall
would
be
much
better
if
the
taste
lived
up
to
the
smell
a
wintry
powerful
brew
that
is
a
little
offputting
at
first
and
a
little
hot
at
the
end
but
its
an
interesting
variation
on
barleywines
better
than
most
of
the
mad
river
stuff
in
my
opinion
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
bottlecraft
in
san
diego
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
a
hoppy
barley
wine
that
makes
for
a
nice
winter
warmer
overall
i
thought
this
was
pretty
good
better
than
the
ba
scores
suggest
really
nice
aroma
maybe
a
little
on
the
hot
side
but
not
overwhelming
o
huh
very
unusual
barleywine
a
bit
unnecessarily
harsh
and
almost
no
aroma
not
a
bad
barleywine
just
unusual
flavors
and
not
quite
right
it
was
okay
i
drank
all
of
it
but
it
was
kind
of
a
mess
if
im
honest
the
taste
is
slightly
caramel
up
front
with
a
toasted
and
woody
malt
flavor
with
some
light
spice
and
dried
fruit
presence
in
the
yeast
profile
the
taste
has
a
mild
hop
accent
which
contributes
to
the
bitterness
in
the
taste
which
balances
the
malt
sweetness
well
but
it
also
propels
the
alcohol
in
the
taste
forward
on
the
palate
adding
to
the
perceived
spiciness
and
warming
accent
in
the
semidry
finish
the
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
cellar
worthy
barleywine
i
consider
it
pretty
drinkable
for
the
style
since
it
is
not
intensely
sweet
but
it
does
have
a
strong
alcohol
influence
which
detracts
slighlty
overall
this
has
been
aged
between
2
and
3
years
and
could
stand
up
for
years
to
come
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
overpowering
the
flavors
of
the
malts
but
the
hops
are
still
prominent
i
tasted
a
caramel
syrupy
flavor
mixed
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
molasses
and
malt
with
that
said
you
would
think
this
is
a
sticky
beer
however
it
has
a
very
smooth
finish
that
allows
you
down
it
quite
easily
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
this
again
o
this
is
a
barley
wine
that
was
not
very
good
when
it
was
younger
but
improved
a
bit
with
a
little
aging
still
doesnt
blow
your
socks
off
but
it
has
a
relatively
mild
flavor
which
isnt
offensive
i
like
it
and
it
drinks
good
however
i
would
not
buy
it
again
just
because
of
its
price
overall
its
an
ok
barley
wine
but
not
well
balanced
too
sweet
with
lots
of
harsh
bitter
alcohol
this
is
a
really
nice
balanced
barleywine
its
incredibly
malty
and
sweet
but
the
hops
are
also
intense
and
balance
the
flavor
the
abv
is
well
hidden
adding
only
some
warmth
to
the
mouthfeel
for
11
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
will
definitely
pick
it
up
again
o
overall
just
an
average
barleywine
this
is
a
well
aged
bottle
showing
a
fair
amount
of
oxidation
the
age
is
obviously
showing
a
bit
here
and
really
isnt
doing
this
much
service
better
fresh
i
dont
know
but
as
this
is
just
an
average
barleywine
i
wouldnt
turn
it
away
but
not
anywhere
near
the
top
end
of
the
range
for
this
style
o
not
my
favorite
american
style
barley
wine
the
aroma
is
really
nice
but
something
in
the
flavor
is
lacking
a
bit
not
a
whole
o
overall
a
pretty
good
barleywine
though
different
than
most
because
it
has
a
ton
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
taste
is
very
good
with
nice
caramel
as
well
and
no
real
alcohol
heat
would
like
to
have
it
again
sometime
o
its
a
pretty
decent
aged
barleywine
and
im
kind
of
surprised
more
fans
of
the
english
maltforward
style
dont
like
this
one
i
prefer
these
strong
beers
with
more
of
a
hop
presence
o
maybe
this
needs
some
age
to
mellow
out
the
alcohol
and
bring
out
some
complexity
however
this
would
work
well
with
a
rich
dessert
like
cheese
cake
or
tiramisu
drink
a
nice
barleywine
but
nothing
too
fancy
or
overwhelming
a
solid
above
average
and
on
the
border
of
being
great
id
have
again
or
just
age
a
couple
if
i
find
more
toffee
brown
sugar
and
cinnamon
rolls
on
the
nose
a
thick
slick
liquid
swells
in
your
mouth
with
the
first
pull
a
lot
of
sweet
stuff
in
there
not
enough
alcohol
flavor
or
warmth
to
account
for
the
11
abv
there
is
a
bit
of
tartness
that
cuts
the
sweet
explosion
the
tartness
mind
you
is
the
same
youd
get
from
a
sweet
cherry
sucker
and
not
from
an
unripe
banana
or
a
grapefruit
my
only
criticism
is
that
it
finishes
a
little
too
quickly
once
it
does
finish
theres
a
bit
of
bitter
alcohol
that
remains
on
the
tongue
not
bad
though
this
is
a
fine
sipping
beer
that
unfolds
with
a
progressive
story
suitable
for
conversation
or
a
meal
but
likely
best
late
at
night
this
sample
aged
two
years
in
the
cellar
was
there
some
real
age
on
this
bottle
to
make
it
less
hoppy
and
thus
more
pleasant
i
dont
know
i
do
know
that
i
want
to
get
some
more
and
open
my
mind
to
more
american
barleywines
this
was
a
real
pleasant
surprise
and
im
glad
i
found
it
12oz
bottle
that
i
picked
up
for
2
50
should
have
bought
a
whole
four
pack
i
was
a
little
hesitant
given
the
high
abv
but
i
love
barleywine
so
why
not
tick
a
new
one
ruby
red
color
decent
head
at
first
but
then
it
was
only
a
memory
initial
aroma
of
fruit
malts
barleywine
first
taste
was
cherry
cough
syrup
but
once
i
let
it
warm
up
it
really
came
alive
good
flavors
of
fruit
brown
sugar
barleywine
not
really
even
a
hint
of
hops
which
is
fine
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
i
might
have
to
buy
a
four
pack
to
age
a
year
just
to
see
how
it
does
o
an
excellent
barleywine
one
of
the
first
real
beers
i
ever
tasted
and
one
that
has
only
improved
with
time
highly
recommended
if
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
more
or
less
wellbalanced
plenty
of
toffee
and
caramel
in
the
nose
with
light
grape
raisin
and
baked
apple
notes
im
not
sure
when
this
was
bottled
but
even
if
it
was
the
last
day
of
2010
theres
still
a
surprisingly
potent
dose
of
bitterness
in
this
stuff
earthy
and
burnt
flavors
join
in
to
provide
a
counterpoint
to
the
sweetness
the
fruitiness
isnt
as
pronounced
as
id
guessed
it
would
be
and
somethings
a
little
lacking
here
instead
of
a
coating
lingering
warm
feel
it
almost
finishes
clean
and
a
tad
on
the
thin
side
this
could
be
quite
nice
with
a
few
tweaks
i
reckon
overall
the
barleycorn
certainly
improves
with
some
warmth
and
air
it
was
served
to
me
at
about
45
degrees
but
after
sitting
for
a
bit
it
really
showed
itself
off
for
what
it
is
a
nice
solid
barleywine
o
this
beer
is
much
more
than
admirable
its
fantastic
what
a
great
introduction
to
mad
river
glad
to
have
multiple
different
bottles
in
the
fridge
o
maybe
im
a
barleywine
guy
third
tonight
started
with
the
uinta
anniversary
barleywine
then
tried
a
harpoon
leviathan
barleywine
and
now
this
there
is
no
standout
in
this
trio
they
are
all
excellent
and
i
would
drink
them
all
again
and
again
but
noticed
that
the
john
barleycorn
was
the
sweetest
of
the
3
but
unfortunately
as
stated
it
was
also
allowed
to
warm
to
room
temp
before
beginning
to
drink
so
this
may
have
had
an
impact
on
sweetness
and
taste
my
3strongbeersin
perspective
if
you
like
or
are
curious
about
this
style
of
beer
you
have
nothing
to
lose
by
trying
any
or
all
of
these
beers
clearly
mad
river
has
made
an
excellent
beer
and
i
can
easily
recommend
it
o
this
is
surprisingly
mediocre
i
say
surprisingly
because
the
barrelaged
version
was
truly
outstanding
i
even
made
a
second
trip
out
to
beer
revolution
to
grab
another
glass
it
was
worth
trying
but
i
dont
think
ill
pick
it
up
again
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
dark
red
red
amber
with
ruby
undertones
thin
layer
of
foam
but
what
is
there
is
persistent
muted
aroma
of
grassy
and
slight
caramel
malt
dry
and
caramel
malt
molasses
with
some
nut
elements
medium
creamy
bodied
this
is
still
a
quite
unique
flavored
barleywine
this
2009
cellar
reserve
bottle
is
not
as
dominated
by
the
dry
grass
malty
flavor
of
the
last
bottle
i
tried
but
that
element
is
still
present
the
flavor
is
somewhat
one
dimensional
but
still
intriguing
a
somewhat
eccentric
take
on
a
barleywine
and
worth
sampling
every
year
or
so
pours
a
caramel
color
with
little
head
slightly
hazy
sticky
looking
liquid
aroma
of
vanilla
caramel
sugar
and
alcohol
smells
like
a
barleywine
of
moderate
intensity
in
the
taste
sweet
toffee
caramel
maple
syrup
dates
brown
sugar
and
vanilla
some
wood
flavor
possibly
from
the
hops
and
lots
of
sweetness
and
fruityness
alcohol
is
present
but
has
mellowed
over
time
mouthfeel
is
that
of
a
thick
medium
bodied
syrupy
decently
carbonated
brew
overall
a
nice
sipper
that
really
has
gotten
better
with
age
very
nice
great
to
savor
wish
i
bought
more
then
just
the
one
bottle
i
expected
a
touch
more
hop
character
in
the
aroma
but
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
its
a
bit
hot
but
wouldnt
age
it
too
long
or
the
hop
flavor
could
be
lost
resulting
in
an
overly
sweet
brew
o
aside
from
the
astringency
this
was
a
decent
beer
take
that
away
and
this
would
be
a
good
beer
i
received
this
in
a
trade
i
cant
say
that
i
would
ever
buy
it
because
there
are
just
too
many
better
barleywines
out
there
aroma

bitter
finish
o
the
beer
definitely
tastes
strong
but
some
of
the
alcohol
is
masked
from
the
taste
its
a
good
beer
so
slowly
sip
and
savor

a
cold

into
a

tumbler
poured
a
brownish
orange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
spices
earth
and
subtle
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
earth
subtle
alcohol
and
caramel
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
there
was
nothing
on
this
one
that
really
made
it
stand
out
from
other
barleywines
i
have
tasted
in
the
past
all
of
the
usual
barleywine
flavors
were
present
but
it
just
wasnt
complex
enough
to
put
this
one
into
another
league
for
me
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
or
are
a
big
fan
of
barleywines
are
all
barley
wines
this
good
i
dont
think
so

with
a

tan

that
collars
around
the
glass
sweet
aroma
of
caramel
slight
toffee
vanilla
and
some
citrus
notes
the
aroma
is
nice
medium
mouthfeel
but
bordering
on
a
little
light
slight
roast
caramel
some
booze
and
a
lingering
bitterness
leaves
a
little
orange
like
sweetness
on
the
lips
as
it
warms
it
has
a
slight
soapy
note
to
it
overall
i
feel
this
barleywine
may
be
one
that
is
best
enjoyed
fresh
it
does
have
some
very
nice
characteristics
but
the
flavors
seemed
a
bit
muted
and
the
mouthfeel
was
not
what
i
suspected
o
not
very
high
on
my
list
for
barleywines
just
too
little
going
here
compared
to
other
brewers
out
there
interestingly
the
aroma
is
better
than
the
taste
of
this
beer
sturdy
barleywine

pours
a
slightly
cloudy
light
molasses
color
with
a
faint
orange
tint
2
inch
off
white
head
smells
of
dried
fruit
and
alcohol
sweet
malts
as
well
flavor
is
huge
malty
base
with
gentle
bittersweet
fruits
plums
maybe
and
a
major
alcohol
finish
even
more
pronounces
as
it
warms
almost
to
the
level
of
a
sweet
rubbing
alcohol
a
good
winter
sipper
but
a
few
of
these
might
put
you
under
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
booze
burn
might
age
well
this
is
the
type
of
american
barleywine
i
enjoy
hops
that
are
faded
but
show
lightly
a
lot
of
caramel
and
a
generous
helping
of
alcohol
warmth
i
know
most
people
would
want
to
tame
it
but
this
is
what
i
relish
o
maybe
its
just
me
but
the
vintages
of
this
bw
are
solid
never
had
it
fresh
but
had
several
07
08
and
at
the
price
point
this
is
a
good
bw
for
not
being
barrel
aged
solid
clean
bw
o
i
am
glad
i
picked
it
up
but
wont
be
going
back
to
get
it
again
nothing
at
all
really
stands
out
bottom
line
a
very
typical
barleywine
if
you
see
it
try
it
but
no
need
to
go
look
for
it
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
barleywine
but
nothing
special
worth
drinking
if
you
see
it
but
you
dont
need
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
find
it
o
it
was
drinking
better
than
i
thought
and
was
even
more
tasty
than
i
thought
it
would
be
o
this
brew
did
not
measure
up
to
mrbcs
stigma
very
disappointing
recommended
but
not
worth
a
hunt
very
average
i
dont
find
the
beer
overly
boozy
in
flavor
as
others
have
noted
of
course
at
10
it
does
pack
a
wallop
glad
i
got
to
try
this
and
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
is
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
maybe
in
a
year
or
two
this
will
mellow
out
a
bit
but
for
now
i
find
this
to
be
too
harsh
overall
not
bad
and
its
around
all
the
time
so
i
think
if
i
were
in
the
mood
and
didnt
want
to
pop
for
a
more
expensive
version
i
could
go
back
to
it
o
eh
nothing
special
its
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
but
it
is
quite
far
from
good
in
my
opinion
pours
a
murky
super
dark
brown
with
a
2
inch
puffy
light
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
a
nice
latticework
of
lace
forms
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
brown
sugar
toffee
and
lots
of
citrus
zest
hops
taste
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
and
some
citrus
zest
flavors
pretty
straightforward
progression
from
the
nose
there
is
a
very
mild
bitterness
that
quickly
fades
from
the
palate
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
barleywine
but
nothing
too
special
i
didnt
find
this
one
to
be
as
bad
as
others
seem
to
think
in
the
reviews
o
not
a
really
terrible
brew
but
not
really
great
either
probably
not
a
brew
that
ill
seek
out
again
taste
whoo
still
very
hot
yeasty
grittiness
on
the
teeth
ample
sweetness
and
huge
bitterness
still
on
this
one
tough
to
pull
much
in
the
way
of
taste
out
of
this
the
alcohol
is
just
omniprescient
or
whatever
that
word
is
had
em
fresh
had
em
aged
just
not
a
fan
at
any
stage
of
this
despite
liking
many
mad
river
brews
seemed
to
be
lacking
the
necessary
malt
additions
to
soak
up
the
alcohol
presence
overall
definitely
not
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
but
decent
it
needs
character
and
personality
definitely
suffers
from
a
serious
identity
crisis
and
i
just
dont
know
what
mad
river
was
trying
to
paint
in
this
portrait
i
bought
a
4pack
of
this
based
on
the
recommendation
of
the
liquor
store
beer
guy
so
i
could
try
one
and
give
out
the
rest
as
trade
extras
with
that
said
i
apologize
in
advance
to
those
who
received
this
as
an
extra
in
their
trades
with
mei
didnt
know
i
swear
reviews
seem
harsh
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
barleywine
could
age
really
well
o
i
would
have
loved
for
this
to
be
a
bit
more
aromatic
and
flavorful
its
mostly
just
booze
and
a
tad
bitter
at
the
finish
not
bad
but
not
sure
its
worth
the
price
overall
its
a
good
barleywine
and
a
decent
value
i
wish
i
would
have
tried
it
fresh
i
bet
its
pretty
hoppy
good
but
not
the
best
not
overly
impressed
with
this
especially
given
that
it
has
had
4
years
in
the
bottle
to
meld
not
bad
but
not
one
to
look
for
in
my
opinion
not
much
head
on
this
one
dark
mahogany
colored
just
looks
creamy
smell
is
weak
smells
of
sugar
alcohol
fig
and
raisin
tastes
very
similar
to
the
nose
but
the
alcohol
isnt
present
very
boring
not
bad
but
just
boring
theres
nothing
that
stands
out
as
unique
or
special
mouthfeel
next
to
none
in
carbonation
creamy
light
too
light
imo
overall
this
should
be
more
like
6
or
8
bucks
a
6
pack
rather
than
11
or
12
bucks
for
a
4
pack
just
not
worth
the
money
not
exactly
a
bad
barleywine
but
rather
weak
in
flavor
while
still
being
alcohol
forward
overly
sweet
and
full
of
rock
candy
and
medicinal
elements
that
dont
work
well
together
mad
river
is
capable
of
better
though
this
style
isnt
their
forte
overall
this
is
a
goodquality
barleywine
though
perhaps
slightly
weighty
on
the
sugars
a
heavier
grain
counter
would
have
helped
balance
the
brew
better
still
the
sugary
flavors
are
wellcrafted
and
sure
to
please

2007
bottle
drank
in
2008
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
hazy
brown
color
the
head
was
pretty
nice
looking
and
thick
the
lacing
was
pretty
good
here
also
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
pretty
hoppy
with
some
sweet
barley
in
the
mix
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
very
hoppy
all
around
and
was
sweet
too
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
syrupy
had
some
decent
carbonation
to
it
overall
i
found
it
to
be
a
pretty
good
barley
wine
o
well
crafted
for
sure
since
their
were
several
different
flavors
taking
place
but
it
didnt
wow
me
like
a
few
other
barley
wines
have
overall
i
would
not
get
this
again
balance
is
not
very
good
and
the
weird
sour
bitterness
is
unpleasant
and
continues
for
a
while
in
the
aftertaste
poured
a
hazy
dark
brown
color
with
a
light
brown
head
big
aromas
of
spices
and
booze
on
the
palate
full
bodied
with
way
too
much
spice
and
a
hot
finish
way
too
spicy
for
me
delicious
but
i
wish
this
was
english
style
the
hops
hide
the
great
rich
flavors
underneath
as
an
american
style
its
quite
good
though
very
much
like
a
good
quality
english
but
with
a
healthy
punch
of
hops
though
i
prefer
my
barleywines
sans
hops
i
would
have
more
of
this
in
a
heartbeat
a
decent
barleywine
this
is
just
a
pretty
straight
forward
big
beer

really
great
color
and

the
smell
is
lovely
im
having
a
hard
time
pinning
down
what
exactly
im
smelling
sweet
and
fruity
malty
tiny
hint
of
whisky
smooth
aroma
suggestion
of
vanilla
and
you
can
almost
smell
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
earthy
somewhere
in
the
back
a
tiny
whiff
of
black
pepper
the
flavor
rolls
in
smooth
and
sweet
some
southern
sweettea
leads
into
a
mild
easy
round
bitterness
still
enough
bitterness
to
make
me
sneeze
though
im
tasting
some
mild
pine
a
little
lemonsugar
tasty
tasty
barleywine
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
smooth
lightly
warming
but
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
at

8
the
late
finish
has
some
interesting
hoppy
toffee
in
there
you
know
its
not
too
shabby
being
that
its
not
obscenely
sweet
it
makes
for
a
nice
sipper
i
didnt
have
it
fresh
but
it
seems
to
have
held
up
well
some
oxidation
nothing
over
the
top
i
may
see
if
i
can
track
down
another
bottle
or
two
o
an
enjoyable
everyday
barley
wine
hides
the
abv
quite
well
not
a
ton
of
complexity
but
drinkable
and
good
for
what
it
is
deep
tan
head
of
nicely
dense
foam
however
you
can
see
the
bubbles
pop
moves
like
a
barrel
of
worms
until
theres
nothing
left
across
the
surface
lacing
is
negligible
full
on
chunks
floating
throughout
the
yellowbrown
liquid
vague
amber
darkening
at
the
core
muddy
waters
shows
a
few
bourbon
like
notes
alongside
the
chocolate
butterscotch
banana
fig
some
corn
and
sweeter
grains
mild
orange
reduction
scone
to
soda
bread
has
an
unfortunate
lack
of
explosiveness
and
weight
kind
of
folds
in
on
itself
in
the
mouth
its
close
to
fullbodied
durable
carbonation
helps
it
expand
across
the
palate
decently
more
fig
yellow

date
and
then
cherry
banana
blackberry
notes
still
not
quite
sweet
brown

without

and
rum
cake
carrot
cake
metallic
undercurrent
along
with
a
light
pepperiness
not
sure
if
this
bottle
has
faded
some
but
it
just
comes
across
as
lacking
in
selfassurance
and
richness
of
expression
so
physically
drinkable
without
making
you
want
to
drink
it
oa
decent
barleywine
but
not
a
repeater
for
me
d
very
drinkable
beer
not
the
best
but
good
have
a
few
bottles
still
and
will
hold
onto
them
and
send
out
as
extras
medium
body
lighter
on
the
carbonation
some
warming
alcohol
nice
mix
of
darker
fruit
malt
and
hops
this
could
still
sit
for
a
while
as
there
is
some
heat
still
pretty
good
would
buy
again
given
the
opportunity
picked
up
a
four
banger
on
a
ca
roadtrip
overall
seek
out
the
2008
or
2009
version
even
the
2010
version
seems
to
have
better
score
but
this
is
just
sad
man
what
a
let
down
for
the
2011
version
pours
a
translucent
deep
reddish
color
with
some
speckles
floating
around
sizable
tan
head
is
produced
from
a
vigorous
pour
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
lacing
all
up
the
sides
of
my
bruery
tulip
smells
strongly
of
faded
hops
with
dark
fruits
and
a
hint
of
rubbing
alcohol
this
beer
certainly
is
fragrant
the
taste
is
much
smoother
than
the
smell
though
im
guessing
that
the
age
on
this
bottle
is
doing
it
big
favors
the
hops
are
only
hinted
at
now
though
i
assume
they
were
once
strong
bitterness
does
longer
slightly
and
marries
the
dark
fruit
booze
raisin
flavor
of
a
barleywine
that
being
said
this
beer
lacks
a
clarity
of
flavor
which
seems
to
match
the
nose
there
is
a
lot
going
on
but
i
dont
know
if
it
is
working
all
that
well
in
harmony
low
to
medium
carbonation
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
helps
make
this
beer
sort
of
drinkable
for
the
style
i
guess
im
underwhelmed
drinkability
boozy
and
warming
with
nice
dark
fruit
makes
for
decent
barleywine
although
id
not
drink
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
this
2008
barleycorn
is
quite
a
nice
surprise
the
flavors
are
wellbalanced
a
little
sweet
but
very
drinkable
maybe
this
ale
needs
some
time
to
sit
before
drinking
whatever
the
case
i
feel
that
this
is
a
really
good
beer
with
some
standout
flavors
at
11
this
is
a
beer
i
would
have
one
over
the
period
of
45
minutes
to
an
hour
the
flavors
are
consistent
and
the
body
is
nice
this
particular
brew
doesnt
offer
anything
new
though
but
it
still
makes
for
an
excellent
night
cap
d
i
liked
this
beer
for
what
it
is
but
its
certainly
not
a
go
to
brew
or
very
drinkable
to
me
its
a
beer
id
like
to
sit
down
with
in
the
winter
season
to
warm
me
up
but
nothing
id
have
more
than
2
of
at
one
sitting
overall
i
think
its
not
bad
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
i
just
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
complexity
instead
of
just
sweet
fruity
alcoholic
flavors
and
smells
worth
a
try
though
for
fans
of
barleywines
this
is
a
really
solid
barleywine
and
extremely
drinkable
considering
its
11
abv
good
stuff
mf
not
as
hugebodied
as
youd
expect
an
11
barleywine
to
be
but
that
makes
it
dangerously
drinkable
this
beer
is
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
while
not
chewy
or
heavy
gah
im
wrong
again

this

and
its

next
review
im
going
to
guess
what
i
think
it
is
then
pick
something
completely
different
carbonation
is
near
gone
making
for
a
very
smooth
drink
abv
becomes
a
much
more
dominant
presence
one
would
think
that
after
2
years
it
would
been
resolved
perhaps
not

this
is
an
amazing
barleywine
certainly
worthy
of
extended
aging
the
06
is
drinking
out
of
this
world
right
now
this
is
the
most
underrated
beer
on
ba
it
blows
my
mind
very
good

very
rich

dessert
beer
for
sure
my
bottle
has
a
different
label
and
says
its
the
2009
cellar
reserve
so
this
must
be
a
special
run
the
beer
poured
cloudy
auburn
in
color
and
had
a
one
finger
thick
head
that
lasted
for
quite
a
while
when
left
alone
there
didnt
appear
to
be
any
lingering
carbonation
after
the
initial
pour
the
aroma
was
very
much
like
liquefied
raisins
with
some
slight
pine
in
the
background
the
taste
was
sweet
and
vinous
with
a
lot
of
toffee
and
very
little
hop
presence
considering
the
style
the
sweetness
was
not
cloying
though
and
there
was
a
restrained
spiciness
in
the
finish
very
clean
tasting
with
almost
no
hot
notes
which
made
it
very
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
the
first
impression
made
me
feel
that
this
was
a
little
too
light
in
the
mouth
but
the
thickness
seemed
to
be
better
after
it
warmed
up
a
straightforward
but
extremely
elegant
drink
full
in
body
and
lightly
carbonated
oil
slickness
and
a
warm
alcohol
finish
not
to
shabby
of
a
barleywine
if
i
say
so
myself
but
at
the
same
price
point
theres
better
old
ales
available
and
theres
better
barleywines
as
well
and
i
would
recommend
seeking
those
out
first
i
tried
another
from
this
4pack
and
it
was
a
completely
different
beer
it
seems
the
one
i
reviewed
above
was
a
bad
beer
ive
never
had
a
bad
beer
before
the
second
one
was
delicious
sweet
and
fruity
but
the
alcohol
balanced
everything
with
a
pleasant
spiciness
there
was
no
bitterness
and
the
mouth
feel
was
far
less
carbonated
and
not
course
at
all
this
one
was
very
drinkable
im
going
to
have
another
right
now
the
scores
now
reflects
the
second
beer
i
really
liked
this
one
it
isnt
too
sweet
or
cloying
and
the
hop
bite
balances
out
the
fruity
malts
perfectly
perhaps
this
is
the
year
to
drink
this
one
because
it
is
really
quite
nice
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
chewy
without
being
sweet
i
dont
know
what
yall
are
drinking
but
this
was
great
the
flavor
is
big
with
the
caramel
and
toffee
playing
a
big
part
and
a
pronounced
hop
profile
coming
through
as
well
very
little
alcohol
heat
or
burn
but
im
not
sure
how
much
to
expect
when
the
abv
is
9
1
either
way
its
well
masked
in
the
flavor
dates
plum
and
fruit
jam
comes
through
big
time
in
the
flavor
as
well
over
all
this
is
a
nice
barleywine
but
it
may
err
just
a
bit
of
the
sweet
side
a
more
roasty
natural
malt
presence
is
desired
all
in
all
this
is
still
a
very
good
drink
im
glad
this
one
comes
in
12
oz
bottles
because
i
dont
think
i
could
handle
a
bomber
by
myself
im
not
sure
any
barley
wine
is
really
drinkable
its
highly
alcoholic
and
very
bitter
however
theres
a
malty
creaminess
to
it
that
keeps
me
drinking
it
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
i
was
hoping
there
would
be
more
hop
to
balance
out
the
sweet
malt
but
a
little
unbalanced
other
comments
my
favorite
barleywine
is
old
saguaro
that
is
the
standard
by
which
i
rate
other
bws
this
one
comes
fairly
close
drink
is
great
this
is
a
great
barleywine
and
im
thinking
for
the
price
i
will
pick
up
another
taste
profiles
a
little
like
a
belgian
quad
but
not
heavily
hopped
this
does
seem
to
be
an
englishstyle
barleywine
from
what
ive
heard
of
the
style
my
guess
is
that
nationalist
tastebuds
overvaluing
lots
of
citrusy
hops
are
the
reason
behind
the
relatively
low
ratings
but
i
dig
it
i
think
most
americanstyle
barleywines
are
overhopped
personally
i
will
never
buy
this
again
d
a
decent
barleywine
drinkable
but
i
wont
be
searching
for
it
again
oh
taste
is
pretty
nice
what
a
dichotomy
from
the
nose
toasty
and
caramely
sweet
with
a
full
body
and
smooth
creaminess
that
fits
in
with
the
best
barleywines
some
vanilla
raisins
and
rotting
fig
fruitiness
comes
out
as
it
warms
very
enjoyable
brew
i
like
it
somewhere
in
between
an
english
and
an
american
bw
has
some
flavors
from
both
styles
here
id
buy
it
again
seems
to
age
quite
well
this
is
a
pretty
mild
barleywine
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
just
a
high
abv
it
easy
drinking
for
sure
and
i
liked
the
mouthfeel
but
otherwise
would
be
looking
somewhere
else
for
a
barleywine
the
body
was
a
fair
bit
thinner
than
i
enjoy
for
the
style
drinkability
was
pretty
good
ill
definitely
grab
this
again
overall
a
beer
you
should
try
if
your
a
bw
fan
and
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
beer
in
general
d
not
the
best
barely
wine
ive
had
but
nothing
to
turn
away
from
it
has
no
bad
point
but
not
enough
good
points
poured
in
to
a
pint
glass
with
a
nice
deep
copper
color
with
a
carmel
head
very
smooth
drink
even
with
a
9
5
abv
nice
lite
fruity
smell
with
a
little
hint
of
prune
flavor
with
each
drink
though
the
malt
flavor
is
very
present
it
was
my
first
barley
wine
and
i
have
to
say
i
was
very
pleased
d
average
drinkability
for
a
barleywine
not
something
you
would
want
to
gulp
but
tasty
overall
this
is
a
good
barleywine
but
not
great
d
pretty
sure
this
is
the
best
barleywine
that
ive
had
theres
something
rustic
to
it
and
it
doesnt
try
to
be
too
extreme
i
think
it
is
really
tasty
and
definitely
would
like
to
get
it
again
theres
a
bit
of
bite
as
you
drink
this
and
it
leaves
the
tongue
dry
when
its
done
a
decent
if
not
slightly
harsh
barleywine
this
beer
improves
as
it
warms
so
give
it
time
good
for
one
id
wait
until
another
evening
to
have
a
second
drinkability
its
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
but
a
little
imbalanced
and
not
in
my
opinion
a
great
example
of
the
style
the
best
quality
of
this
beer
is
its
unapologetic
caramel
quality
it
should
be
named
sugar
daddy
but
i
expect
a
barley
wine
to
have
a
little
something
else
going
for
it
its
almost
as
if
this
is
a
good
base
recipe
they
need
to
riff
on
in
future
batches
it
just
doesnt
stand
out
the
body
is
creamy
and
smooth
i
can
tell
that
some
of
the
carbonation
is
lost
but
its
still
a
pleasant
sipper
this
beer
starts
out
semisweet
like
cherry
candy
but
then
melds
to
a
smooth
bitter
taste
on
the
finish
the
bitterness
is
low
here
plenty
of
malt
presence
as
im
getting
lots
of
toffee
and
caramel
nothing
really
stands
out
here
but
its
still
good
nonetheless
not
a
bad
beer
d
1
or
2
will
do
it
on
these
while
there
are
no
strong
alcohol
flavors
this
beer
is
10
8
and
should
be
respected
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
could
probably
put
down
4
or
5
of
these
but
the
fun
of
this
beer
lies
in
identifying
all
the
new
aromas
and
flavors
each
time
you
bring
it
up
to
your
mouth
after
2
of
these
i
think
you
would
lose
that
ability
time
to
switch
to
a
macro
and
keep
that
party
going
barleycorn
is
a
pretty
solid
little
barleywine
that
has
a
nice
malty
thick
body
with
a
touch
of
classy
spice
and
warming
to
it
its
not
as
downable
as
some
of
the
more
caramelized
yummy
west
coasters
out
there
but
it
sips
well
enough
to
enjoy
a
bottle
or
two
of
without
much
hassle
notes
quite
a
surprise
there
is
some
us
brash
bitterness
found
on
plenty
of
barleywines
this
side
of
the
pond
but
here
it
works
rather
well
being
a
second
layer
to
the
rich
malty
profile
if
some
aging
soothes
that
aspect
and
adds
some
complexity
this
has
the
potential
to
be
a
truly
outstanding
barleywine
d
not
an
overwhelming
amount
of
complexity
but
for
sure
a
solid
beer
2006
vintage
ontap
at
flying
saucer
for
2
75
hard
to
beat
that
served
in
a
tulip
glass
a
slightly
murkey
dark
orange
with
a
nice
frothy
khaki
head
that
lasts
and
leaves
great
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
slight
burnt
caramel
malts
and
slight
dried
fruits
the
taste
is
a
surprisingly
fruity
malt
front
with
some
slight
hop
undertones
the
beer
is
somewhat
heavy
but
the
alcohol
is
far
from
overbearing
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
barley
wine
one
that
has
aged
quite
well
the
body
was
full
and
very
creamy
with
a
nice
chewy
sticky
dry
finish
the
carbonation
was
light
and
fluffy
the
beers
components
did
a
nice
job
of
distracting
from
the
alcohol
content
very
good
flavors
and
good
drinkability
to
this
one
i
felt
it
walked
a
good
line
on
a
tough
style
i
could
not
finish
this
one
dhuge
flavors
and
a
nice
complexity
blending
big
malt
and
hop
together
the
bitterness
at
the
finish
is
a
nice
hop
touch
but
i
cant
keep
drinking
and
the
mouth
really
feels
dry
after
sipping
overall
very
drinkable
but
the
flavors
are
a
tad
sweet
and
lacking
some
true
character
the
rich
sweet
caramel
malt
is
present
but
i
get
the
same
in
a
number
of
their
beers
and
many
from
other
brewers
overall
would
recommend
this
beer
for
a
good
wintertime
joy
f
t
i
cant
believe
this
beer
doesnt
rate
higher
im
not
sure
how
this
beer
tasted
fresh
but
it
sure
ages
well
imo
chewy
medium
body
which
is
shockingly
very
hop
forward
i
was
not
expecting
this
since
the
beer
is
over
a
year
old
the
hops
are
bitter
and
piny
with
subtle
citrus
notes
this
is
quickly
balanced
by
a
sweet
alcohol
and
leathery
malt
body
hints
of
earthy
caramel
malt
toffee
biscuit
chocolate
more
hops
and
sweet
alcohol
although
there
is
plenty
of
alcohol
flavor
there
is
very
little
heat
or
warmth
in
the
finish
the
high
abv
is
well
masked
and
the
excellent
complexity
make
this
beer
very
quaffable
bottle
pours
a
brownruby
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
nice
fruity
smell
i
think
im
going
to
like
this
one
just
enough
carbonation
very
smooth
alcohol
taste
on
the
first
drink
was
a
surprise
not
unpleasant
but
more
than
i
was
expecting
very
fruity
taste
and
sweet
sticky
mouthfeel
and
very
good
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
some
haze
in
a
muddy
amber
brown
body
finger
of
light
khaki
brown
head
some
lacing
toffee
cookie
and
mild
cocoa
malts
on
the
nose
some
oxidizedish
madeira
and
shoe
leather
maybe
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
taste
starts
off
with
a
flash
of
woody
hop
bitterness
soon
becomes
malty
with
good
amounts
of
toffee
caramel
and
sugary
rummy
fruits
woody
minty
slightly
astringent
hop
bitterness
comes
on
into
the
finish
a
bit
too
warm
with
notes
of
fusel
alcohol
more
woody
hops
and
lingering
toffee
in
the
finish
mediumfull
body
with
a
slightly
sticky
feel
a
little
harsh
although
i
did
like
the
malt
flavors
d
next
time
i
will
have
a
different
barleywine
or
a
different
mad
river
brew
this
beer
doesnt
suck
but
it
is
not
too
special
either
i
have
very
mixed
reviews
on
barleywines
from
flat
earths
winter
warlock
to
sierra
nevadas
bigfoot
i
guess
i
dont
really
know
what
the
style
should
be
but
this
seems
to
middle
ground
and
i
liked
it
overall
pretty
decent
not
sure
id
want
more
than
one
at
any
given
time
flavors
are
a
bit
all
over
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
with
some
time
on
it
this
poured
a
cloudy
mahogany
with
some
tan
head
it
smelled
like
chocolate
and
caramel
and
roasted
barley
with
some
copper
hops
and
earthy
brown
sugar
it
tasted
like
cocoa
powder
and
roasted
barley
and
brown
sugar
with
some
copper
hops
and
earthy
caramel
and
a
bit
of
creamy
yeast
it
was
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
has
a
very
nice
malty
scent
and
taste
with
great
body
it
hid
the
alcohol
fairly
well
too
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
i
could
see
this
mellowing
further
with
some
age
more
like
an
english
than
american
barleywine
to
me
and
not
super
exciting
but
still
a
very
nice
beer
ddefinitely
along
the
lines
of
an
english
barley
wine
very
enjoyable
and
would
stack
up
there
with
most
if
the
body
had
a
little
more
to
it
d
once
again
mad
river
has
done
me
right
i
never
hear
anyone
talking
about
this
brewery
but
they
seem
to
make
some
pretty
solid
beers
the
hops
and
malt
are
well
balanced
and
manage
to
play
off
each
other
well
in
this
beer
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
is
perhaps
a
touch
too
sugary
i
find
nothing
serious
to
complain
about
and
the
hop
flavor
in
particular
is
quite
complex
and
well
done
id
drink
another
one
if
i
had
one
this
actually
started
out
okay
with
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
hint
of
ruby
and
a
thin
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
initial
aroma
was
malty
sweet
dark
fruit
as
was
the
first
couple
sips
then
the
alcohol
grabbed
hold
from
about
the
fourth
sip
on
all
i
could
taste
and
smell
was
alcohol
blended
with
a
thick
sweet
body
try
as
i
could
i
just
could
not
find
any
other
taste
or
nose
and
ended
up
pouring
this
one
out
all
told
good
stuff
definitely
plan
on
getting
a
few
bottles
to
age
for
a
few
years
d
very
drinkable
indeed
the
flavor
profile
was
great
but
would
have
expected
it
to
stand
out
from
the
other
old
ales
and
barley
wines
i
find
this
very
very
drinkable
for
an
08
and
wouldnt
need
more
aging
would
be
curious
how
it
melds
together
to
something
id
predict
to
be
extremely
mellow
picked
up
a
single
at
blue
max
since
id
never
seen
it
before
this
bottle
was
from
2008
ive
never
had
a
fresh
one
so
i
can
only
guess
that
time
has
muted
the
hops
a
little
it
reminded
me
somewhat
of
13
year
old
bigfoot
note
if
aging
i
would
definitely
wax
the
tops
of
these
bottles
as
they
are
twistoffs
the
few
sips
i
took
left
me
feeling
like
i
had
takein
jd
shot
all
night
not
a
good
beer
i
gotta
say
i
was
looking
forward
to
giving
this
one
a
try
especially
since
the
only
other
mad
river
brew
ive
had
is
the
steelhead
pale
ale
im
unfortunately
a
bit
unimpressed
with
this
selection
when
i
think
of
a
great
intense
barleywine
the
first
beer
that
jumps
to
mind
is
sierra
nevadas
bigfoot
theres
a
smoothness
to
bigfoot
in
spite
of
that
ales
unavoidable
bitterness
and
strength
as
well
as
old
foghorn
and
old
crustacean
that
this
beer
lacks
i
might
have
jumped
the
gun
in
drinking
this
bottle
the
same
year
i
bought
it
but
there
are
definitely
some
harsh
edges
to
this
brew
my
bottles
vintage
is
2008
so
it
already
has
a
year
on
it
but
it
might
be
worthwhile
to
grab
one
and
let
it
sit
in
a
nice
spot
for
2
or
3
years
until
then
im
afraid
im
inclined
to
reach
for
other
barleywines
instead
pours
a
hazy
copper
with
tan
head
the
aroma
has
light
dark
fruitiness
some
rich
creamy
caramel
candy
sweetness
that
is
then
disrupted
with
mild
stale
grains
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
nice
and
vaguely
sn
bigfoot
ale
like
with
both
light
dark
fruitiness
coming
first
along
with
pine
hop
bitterness
then
a
rich
caramel
candy
and
chocolate
maltiness
surfaces
about
midway
toward
the
finish
dry
roasted
malts
hints
of
toffee
and
then
the
distraction
of
stale
grains
kind
of
finish
the
taste
experience
with
a
mild
dose
of
alcohol
a
couple
more
years
of
age
a
bit
less
pine
hops
and
better
grains
non
organic
maybe
and
this
would
be
a
stellar
offering
the
taste
is
not
as
good
and
soon
settles
into
forgettable
onedimensional
blandness
with
alcohol
caramelly
stewed
fruit
especially
prunes
start
things
off
up

with
some
candied
orange
and
spicey
warm
raisiny
rum
it
has
a
light
but
firm
sweetness
with
light
bitterness
and
a
fair
amount
of
spiciness
a
bit
harsh
plus
hints
of
burnt
bread
this
soon
settles
into
a
vague
illdefined
mix
of
overly
hot
spicey
alcohol
vague
hint
of
prune
and
hint
of
burnt
orange
peel
all
subdued
and
nondescript
a
faint
hint
of
meaty
steak
sauce
mixed
with
rough
alcohol
lingers
after
the
finish
the
feel
is
fairly
thick
and
oily
its
boring
too
strong
for
what
you
get
and
quite
tiresome
perhaps
i
should
have
let
it
sit
longer

i
dont

that
should

poured

with
practically
no

is
a
ton
of
caramel

on

some

a
lot
of

malt
in
the
taste
interesting
balance
between
strong
malt
flavors
and
hop

mouthfeel
is
thick

creamy
very
low
carbonation
could
almost
be
a
nitrogenated
beer
overall
pretty
drinkable
especially
for
the
9
5
abv
could
barely
taste
the
alcohol
in
hindsight
i
feel
this
would
be
a
lot
better
if
id
let
it
age
a
couple
of
years
poured
from
a
stubby
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
basic
snifter
glass
2006

a
hazed
rich
deep
brown

with
about
a
finger
or
so
of
fluffy
of

flavor
are

a

better
than
medium

with
ample

looking
forward
to
the
2005
ive
got
as
well
i
ended
up
leaving
my
glass
alone
for
a
while
after
letting
the
beer
come
closer
to
room
temperature
the
flavor
has
opened
up
considerably
the
sweetness
has
relaxed
and
brought
out
more
of
the
bread
flavors
i
was
smelling
the
hops
are
completely
gone
from
the
finish
the
head
is
just
a
memory
i
am
still
very
impressed
with
this
beer
and
will
probably
treat
it
more
like
a
wine
than
a
beer
in
the
future
by
leaving
it
alone
prior
to
enjoying
mouthfeel

mildly
carbonated
2008
version
pours
chestnut
with
a
thick
offwhite
pancake
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
as
it
dissipates
smells
a
little
dry
and
austere
quite
woody
with
notes
of
molasses
and
wet
earth
the
taste
is
much
better
with
brandy
and
chocolate
notes
to
begin
followed
by
some
bitter
earthy
hops
and
wood
and
molasses
on
the
finish
not
perfectly
integrated
yet
but
the
flavors
are
not
muddied
and
are
strong
clear
and
tasty
should
age
quite
well
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
rich
slightly
sweet
and
a
tad
boozy
without
being
hot
quite
full
flavored
but
the
entore
package
is
surprisingly
mellow
nice
an
interesting
take
on
a
barleywine
more
citrusy
than
i
am
used
to
having
would
like
to
try
one
with
some
age
light
amber
with
low
head
come
on
give
us
a
little
more
color
and
a
bit
more
head
smells
like
a
decent
i2pa
northwest
hops
and
a
touch
of
caramel
oh
my
that
is
absolutely
crazy
in
the
mouth
not
a
barleywine
no
crazy
good
really
good
close
but
no
not
barleywine
alas
the
problem
of
having
strict
rating
systems
and
hey
organic
man
these
guys
rock
its
interesting
and
crazy
and
crazy
like
an
i2pa
really
only
with
a
little
more
body
and
a
little
more
bwine
sweetness
some
oxidized
extract
beer
some
bubblegum
t58
bleh
a
hint
of
orange
and
bitter
this
is
a
2007
consumed
in
2009
note
do
not
age
john
barleycorn
crazy
i
wonder
you
know
this
must
be
radically
different
radically
fruity
when
fresh
all
the
more
like
an
i2pa
and
not
like
a
barleywine
but
much
better
to
drink
poured
into
a
snifter
for
a
dark
murky
ruby
tinted
brown
with
a
minimal
tan
head
had
a
strong
alkie
smell
with
some
notes
of
yeast
barley
syrupy
malts
smell
is
a
little
runny
and
overpowering
dry
hot
taste
upfront
due
to
large
abv
poking
through
but
after
initial
taste
there
is
a
semisweetness
to
this
beer
that
lets
it
go
down
smooth
caramel
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
malts
all
seem
to
be
tucked
in
there
and
the
beer
is
slightly
sticky
finishes
dry
like
smokey
or
bourbonesque
dry
but
that
is
more
to
the
alcohol
leaking
through
than
hop
bitterness
or
dry
malts
not
a
bad
beer
to
sip
on
at
all
but
not
the
most
polished
barleywine
out
there
not
something
id
rush
out
and
try
again
but
a
pretty
good
barleywine
this
would
be
great
on
a
cold
winter
night
d
i
have
to
say
this
barleywine
is
a
refreshingly
different
take
on
the
style
the
flavors
feel
very
rural
and
country
redundant
i
know
once
again
not
sure
if
this
was
intended
based
on
the
name
but
if
it
was
it
was
executed
masterfully
definitely
my
favorite
from
mad
river
pours
a
cloudy
brownamber
color
with
lighter
orange
color
along
the
bottom
of
the
glass
one
inch
head
of
a
pale
tan
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
strong
hops
some
sweet
malt
and
some
fruit
raisin
or
plum
fits
the
style
of
an
american
barleywine
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
thick
with
an
average
carbonation
level
also
there
is
a
bitterness
associated
with
this
brew
from
the
combination
of
high
alcohol
and
hops
tastes
of
hops
up
front
then
alcohol
some
sweet
malt
in
the
background
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
the
alcohol
reappears
in
the
finish
one
of
these
goes
back
easy
multiple
might
be
an
issue
drinkability
if
not
for
the
abv
the
balance
this
beer
presents
would
make
it
a
decent
session
beer
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
a
tad
more
bitter
than
im
used
to
for
a
barley
wine
but
still
good
d
middle

w

its
a
good
deal
for
a
buzz
despite
what
others
have
said
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
and
id
like
to
try
a
vintage
on
tap
a
nice
warm
cask
maybe
i
would
have
it
if
i
saw
it
at
a
bar
i
usually
go
to
one
that
didnt
have
much
that
i
havent
tried
that
was
overly
complicated
but
is
really
for
my
own
benefit
for
when
i
go
back
and
read
this
next
year
when
i
try
my
other
john
barleycorn
from
this
batch
in
the
words
of
adrian
belew
i
like
it
overall
a
pretty
solid
high
abv
barleywine
this
beer
is
past
its
prime
but
definitely
not
bad
its
thin
and
light
on
the
flavors
but
it
still
has
some
redeeming
qualities
definitely
the
oldest
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
and
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
peaks
valleys
here
the
look
was
great
the
aroma
not
so
great
and
from
there
all
was
good
will
gladly
have
again
but
wont
seek
it
out
d
john
barleycorn
is
certainly
easy
to
drink
because
despite
the
flaws
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
strong
flavors
arent
present
however
when
i
think
of
a
barleywine
i
think
of
a
long
slow
drink
to
sip
and
savor
and
i
find
myself
gulping
this
stuff
down
to
try
and
find
what
im
missing
how
mad
river
managed
to
brew
a
barleywine
that
has
almost
zero
taste
is
beyond
me
despite
my
above
negatives
i
would
buy
at
least
a
few
of
these
every
year
but
i
would
never
touch
them
without
at
least
a
couple
of
years
in
the
cellar
it
shows
a
ton
of
promise
but
fresh
isnt
high
this
is

for
me

sharp
as
well
noticeable
bold
malty
undertone
with
boozy
flavors
good
full
and
bold
flavors
overall
its
a
very
nice
traditional
barleywine
if
this
brew
went
back
to
the
drawing
board
or
maybe
a
barrel
coughcough
it
may
shape
into
something
wonderful
however
as
currently
sits
its
forgettable
but
at
the
price
point
622oz
its
worthy
oit
was
a
very
complex
beer
you
get
caramel
malt
to
spice
then
hop
bitterness
then
you
get
a
very
good
malt
finish
and
every
sip
gets
better
o
very
nice
balanced
barleywine
worth
trying
green
flash
shows
extreme
competence
in
this
style
with
this
brew
overall
a
great
high
octane
brew
i
appreciate
the
taste
and
like
the
different
variations
of
barleywines
and
other
high
abv
brews
but
i
cant
help
but
wonder
why
those
idiots
keep
drinking
that
manure
4loco
or
whatever
it
is
when
this
is
just
so
much
greater
when
one
may
want
a
higher
abved
beverage
nice
barley
wine
and
thanks
to
cotteridge
wine
for
the
free
tasting
the
most
unique
of
the
four
that
i
tried
and
i
wouldnt
mind
getting
one
again
overall
ive
only
had
one
barleywine
before
moylans
old
blarney
barleywine
style
ale
this
was
my
second
both
are
absolutely
exceptional
i
get
the
feeling
that
this
will
be
my
favourite
style
from
here
on
out
personally
ill
be
sticking
with
bigfoot
and
old
ruffian
as
my
goto
barleywines
but
this
one
is
definitely
worth
trying
mouthfeel
is
full
and
the
finish
lasts
and
lasts
i
had
this
beer
a
few
months
ago
when
it
came
in
from
the
warehouse
from
work
and
now
its
come
back
its
even
better
a
very
special
experience
pretty
hoppy
aggressive
flavours
very
sharp
pine
and
grapefruit
with
accompanying
massive
bitterness
alongside
some
bready

well

with
only
a

after

overall
this
is
a

great

of

flavors
and
very
smooth

a
highly

overall
its
a
nice
smooth
barleywine
that
meets
my
expectations
for
green
flashs
usual
high
standards
o
i
dig
it
it
is
somewhat
similar
to
and
iipa
with
its
hop
profile
what
sets
it
apart
is
its
big
malt
base
overall
clearly
an
american
style
barleywine
with
a
strong
hop
profile
yet
this
is
a
bit
middleoftheroad
for
the
style
with
a
mouthfeel
that
is
slightly
thin
and
a
malt
base
that
is
a
bit
understated
still
quite
a
nice
drinker

the
style
of

mouth
feel

clean

my
only
slight
complaint

that
i

is
had
a
little
more
balance
in
flavors
between
the
hops
and
maltalcohol
single

thick

also
some
dark

and
fig
on
a
caramel

background
well
balanced

with
toasted
caramel
malts
and
earthy
and

hops
with
notes
of
toffee

pine

not
overly
sour

bitter
alcohol
is
a
little
strong
but
not
too
bad
for
the

sooth
medium

moderate
carbonation

an

big

in

with
a
nice

is
really
present
in
the
taste
with
a
lot
of
floralpineycitrusy
notes
an
a
purgent
bitterness
big
malty
sweetness
that
gives
a
full
body
which
balances
the
hop
with
raisinsfigs
aroma
alcohol
at
the
end
gently
tickles
the
throat
really
good
barley
wine
one
of
the
american
examples
that
is
close
to
an
imperial
ipa
in
terms
of
ibu
and
hoppy
notes
i
really
love
that
one
recommended
overall
im
quickly
finding
another
style
of
beer
that
im
likingthis
barleywine
is
not
as
sweet
as
some
ive
had
and
while
thats
not
a
bad
thing
it
just
makes
it
differentthe
malt
flavor
is
a
little
too
amber
malt
for
me
but
thats
the
only
knock
ive
got
and
thats
probably
just
be
a
personal
preferencethe
piney
resinous
hop
flavor
is
strong
and
complimentarythis
is
a
solid
brew
that
doesnt
take
long
to
be
effective
but
isnt
too
strong
to
cloud
my
judgment
eithervery
drinkable
and
easily
recommendablei
definitely
want
to
get
at
least
one
more
for
the
futureits
got
a
vintage
date
which
usually
means
it
can
survive
in
a
cellar
for
at
least
a
couple
of
years
and
i
mind
as
well
test
thatif
you
just
want
a
beer
to
sit
back
and
relax
with
this
is
a
great
choiceshoot
this
is
a
great
choice
for
disc
golfing
with
and
thats
my
highest
honor
i
have
to
say
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
like
this
brew45
pours
a
dark
brownish
ruby
red
color
with
a
finger
and
a
half
dark
tan
head
that
dissipates
somewhat
slowly
and
leaves
a
thick
ring
of
lacing
smells
of
lots
of
carmel
and
toffee
lots
of
bready
notes
from
the
malt
some
brown
sugar
raisins
a
little
dankness
from
the
hops
as
well
as
some
grapefruit
and
pine
thought
there
would
be
more
hops
on
the
nose
taste
starts
with
some
resinous
hop
qualities
such
as
grapefruit
pine
and
orange
rind
then
in
the
middle
the
hop
qualities
take
a
back
seat
to
the
malts
lots
of
carmel
toffee
breadiness
some
molasses
or
brown
sugar
then
the
finish
is
more
of
the
heavy
malt
presence
lots
of
sweetness
and
breadiness
as
well
as
some
raisins
but
more
of
the
resinous
hops
show
through
as
well
more
complex
hops
flavors
show
through
on
the
end
such
as
floral
grass
and
resin
some
booze
on
the
finish
that
provides
a
warming
sensation
on
the
way
down
tastes
very
much
like
bells
this
one
goes
to
11
when
it
warms
as
the
hops
show
through
much
more
a
pretty
full
body
with
a
thick
creamy
and
oily
mouthfeel
have
had
better
american
barleywines
but
still
decent

good
barleywine
worth
getting
again
o
i
cant
tell
if
aging
would
make
this
one
any
better
due
to
the
fact
that
the
hops
are
so
enjoyable
either
way
i
also
enjoyed
its
mild
sweetness
and
would
definitely
have
it
again
i
guess
i
have
to
talk
a
little
more
to
get
to
the
minimum
number
of
words
for
this
review
to
register
o
green
flash
impresses
yet
again
they
have
not
let
me
down
in
a
long
time
well
done
barleywine
perfect
for
a
thursday
night
work
week
wind
down
o
as
straight
forward
as
the
name
this
is
a
nofrills
barleywine
that
is
solid
but
lacks
enthuiasiasm
strong
but
without
complexity
and
interest
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
and
a
worthy
stepping
stone
to
greater
brews
overall
a
real
pleasant
straightforward
barleywine
very
good
this
is
a
really
tasty
barleywine
and
very
easy
to
drink
considering
the
high
abv
but
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
worthy
trying
especially
for
the
price
a
finely
balanced
beer
here
wellexecuted
and
smooth
as
silk
in
traditional
green
flash
style
utilizes
their
signature
malt
base
with
some
very
fruity
hops
to
set
off
the
balance
definitely
leans
more
towards
the
fruity
style
of
barleywines
a
la
founders
bolt
cutter
but
i
prefer
the
sharp
simcoe
flavor
in
the
bigfoot
old
guardian
vein
green
flash
has
definitely
produced
a
fine
brew
here
but
a
bit
on
the
mild
side
for
me
ill
give
this
a
ba
overall
solid
bwine
a
little
bitter
than
most
but
not
too
cliying
nice
mix
of
flavors
i
enjoyed
this
brew
it
was
a
very
well
hopped
interpretation
of
a
barleywine
that
seemed
like
a
sn
bigfoot
that
was
taken
to
the
next
level
o
a
very
dense
complex
barley
wine
with
lots
of
noticeable
flavors
occurring
i
am
trying
it
fresh
for
the
first
time
and
now
im
thinking
about
picking
up
another
bottle
to
lay
down
because
i
believe
this
beer
has
great
potential
for
aging
well
will
report
back
in
a
year
or
two
d
not
the
best
drinker
largely
due
to
difficulties
in
keeping
the
high
abv
under
control
in
the
taste
ive
had
other
brews
just
as
strong
that
do
a
better
job
at
that
task
this
is
a
solid
hoppybeer
that
has
a
great
flavor
and
good
complexity
the
balance
is
there
and
it
has
scary
drinkability
its
a
borderline
dipa
with
the
tropical
fruit
notes
from
the
hops
but
it
packs
a
nice
barleywinelike
malt
character
this
was
a
nice
all
around
its
definitely
worth
a
try
this
beer
was
a
bargain
at
4
99
per
bomber
plus
its
bottle
conditioned
and
should
continue
to
evolve
over
time
i
realize
my
bottle
was
about
a
year
old
i
must
try
a
fresh
bottle
some
time
to
see
if
it
has
a
bit
more
hop
presence
d
a
nofrills
staple
west
coast
american
barleywine
bottle
said
2011
vintage
this
barleywine
has
everything
for
fans
of
the
west
coast
style
wrapped
up
in
the
flavor
there
is
a
blast
of
pine
with
slight
fusel
alcohol
in
the
taste
and
hint
of
spice
with
a
light
caramel
dose
of
malt
in
the
deep
lasting
middle
which
leads
to
a
bitter
and
slightly
warm
finish
the
taste
has
slight
citrusgrapefruit
tinges
but
mainly
pine
oriented
hops
and
gentle
caramel
from
the
malt
combine
with
a
strong
taste
of
alcohol
but
not
overboard
as
it
mainly
comes
through
in
the
finish
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
a
pretty
solid
example
of
an
american
style
barlewine
very
fresh
and
full
of
hops
but
not
really
trying
to
be
an
imperial
ipa
in
disguise
it
has
the
malt
backbone
you
expect
in
a
barleywine
o
a
west
coast
styled
american
barleywine
that
features
substantial
hops
bitterness
alcohol
and
a
surprisingly
high
amount
of
malts
flavors
its
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
a
cool
autumn
night
very
nice
barleywine
that
has
done
well
with
age
i
think
this
would
have
been
a
hot
mess
fresh
very
pleasant
drinker
with
a
unique
spice
component
for
the
style
one
of
the
hoppier
barleywines
ive
ever
had
not
a
miss
per
se
but
probably
below
average
in
the
barleywine
patheon
and
the
weakest
of
many
great
beers
ive
had
from
green
flash
extremely
marginal
recommendation
on
this
one
d
overall
a
solid
american
barleywine
with
some
real
complex
layers
resulting
from
an
extended
boil
of
pale
malts
english
high
crystal
malts
and
perhaps
some
special
b
accentuating
that
raisinfiggy
ester
profile
huge
charge
of
hops
here
not
quite
as
smooth
as
a
sn
bigfoot
when
fresh
but
just
as
good
in
its
own
way
alcohol
definitely
asserts
itself
this
one
could
benefit
from
another
612
months
on
it
o
very
impressed
with
this
one
a
little
on
the
boozy
side
but
very
well
balanced
and
definaitely
worth
a
go
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
and
citrus
zest
taste
is
much
the
same
along
with
a
weird
celerylike
flavor
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
celery
flavor
i
am
picking
up
is
pretty
odd
mo
medium
to
big
body
on
this
one
and
no
alcohol
tasteburn
leaves
the
palate
clean
and
slightly
chewy
overall
its
a
great
barleywine
in
my
opinion
that
tends
to
the
lowhop
characteristics
of
the
style
will
be
a
regular
in
my
fridgecellar
green
flash
barleywine
is
not
my
favorite
american
barleywine
however
it
is
good
nonetheless
nice
warming
winter
ale
overall
if
aroma
was
improved
it
would
complete
the
beer
solid
though
carbonation
is
really
nice
and
overall
i
like
this
beer
o
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
nice
balance
between
bitter
and
sweet
nice
finish
very
tasty
o
a
good
barleywine
but
not
much
else
nothing
really
exceptional
to
set
it
apart
a
worthy
buy

try

overall
this
is
a

and
recommend
to

a
great

of
an
american
barleywine
extreme
but
in
equal
measures
bittersweet
as
it
were
o
finally
a
green
flash
that
i
like
wish
that
i
had
another
to
sit
in
for
a
year
to
compare
notes
not
bad
for
my
first
taste
of
barley
wine
may
come
back
and
rate
this
again
once
ive
had
a
few
o
another
solidly
made
drinkable
beer
from
green
flash
o
think
this
barleywine
is
on
the
turn
to
the
good
stuff
hops
are
not
as
apparent
and
the
malt
is
slowing
taking
over
abv
is
very
obvious
in
spots
and
in
others
quite
smooth
probably
will
be
a
staple
in
my
cellar
for
a
while
od
subtle
version
of
an
american
barleywine
less
aggressive
hop
profile
than
usual
in
the
style
which
i
liked
rich
malt
yet
hoppy
and
aggressive
good
not
usually
a
fan
of
american
barleywines
as
compared
to
the
english
version
this
one
however
was
quite
pleasant
and
the
hop
presence
was
more
balanced
with
the
malts
as
opposed
to
a
bigfoot
imo
its
hard
to
describe
some
of
the
hop
flavors
in
this
one
as
they
blend
so
well
with
the
other
flavors
not
the
best
ive
had
that
honor
goes
to
the
one
the
only
vermonster
o
glad
i
tried
this
wish
i
had
bought
another
one
to
age
for
a
while
o
very
nice
version
of
a
barleywine
i
enjoyed
it
overall
a
decent
barleywine
i
wish
there
were
more
complexity
here
but
overall
this
is
a
wellcrafted
and
tasty
brew

m
some
oxidation
some
astringency
average
for
style
and
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
fresh
bottles
of
barleywine
ive
had
im
sure
it
will
age
very
well
also
but
i
wish
i
had
a
second
bottle
now
good
conventional
barleywine
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
color
like
an
overripe
apple
small
white
head
minimal
lacing
smells
strong
notes
of
spice
and
wheat
bread
are
present
as
is
some
darker
malt
sweetness
flavor
is
nice
well
rounded
this
one
might
age
well
toffee
and
dried
fruit
mingle
in
the
flavor
as
well
feel
is
good
too
bubbly
and
just
short
of
full
bodied
i
could
drink
several
of
these
and
the
price
was
fair
overall
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
barleywines
ive
had
this
season
this
is
certainly
an
american
barleywine
and
a
hopped
up
version
of
one
at
the
that
or
it
could
be
that
the
malt
profile
is
just
extremely
light
either
way
its
tasty
but
more
geared
toward
the
hop
heads
out
there
reasonable
but
really
boozy
neither
hops
nor
malt
are
sufficient
to
tame
the
alcohol
properly
needs
some
age
to
get
interesting
but
certainly
drinkable
now
and
undoubtedly
west
coast
with
that
huge
hoppiness
pretty
solid
barleywine
and
would
probably
improve
with
a
bit
of
age
not
bad
but
not
incredible
given
some
of
the
other
american
barleywines
out
there
o
this
is
a
really
tasty
barleywine
it
leans
toward
sweet
but
has
just
enough
balance
there
are
some
redeeming
characteristics
in
this
beer
is
it
great
no
with
the
right
palette
could
this
beer
be
enjoyable
sure
is
it
mine
not
tonight
pours
a
hazy
dark
copper
hue
which
leaves
a
two
finger
creamy
head
and
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is
piney
citrus
hopsboiled
candytoffee
and
fresh
herbsthe
mouthfeel
is

and
over
medium
bodied
with
tastes
of
sticky
piney

lots
of

mixed

puddingboozy
alcohol
but
only
a
little

pudding
with
the
finish
being
more
sweet
than
bitter
and
overall
a
very
sweet
dessert
brew
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
cheers
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
but
about
average
for
the
style
the
carbonation
is
moderate
to
above
average
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
but
not
an
outstanding
one
it
was
flavorful
and
very
easy
drinking
for
the
style
but
i
just
didnt
find
that
it
stood
out
really
in
any
specific
category
it
was
a
pretty
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
overall
though
while
one
could
sip
this
beer
it
is
better
with
food
try
beef
green
flashs
barley
wine
has
enough
character
to
explore
on
its
own
but
is
much
more
suited
as
an
accompaniment
o
its
good
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
and
not
real
hoppy
for
an
american
barleywine
pretty
easy
to
drink
o
good
american
barleywine
nothing
crazy
or
complex
going
on
here
but
has
nice
sweet
malts
and
citrus
hops
recommended
for
a
test
drive
i
gotta
say
ive
only
had
one
other
barleywine
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
vintage
2010
2011
and
im
beginning
to
release
what
type
of
beer
i
prefer
when
it
comes
to
these
american
strong
ales
i
personally
prefer
a
sweeter
taste
because
many
times
these
dark
brews
can
be
just
so
dry
and
woody
that
i
just
cant
really
enjoy
a
whole
24
ounces
of
it
this
beer
offers
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
blend
of
medium
chocolate
dark
toffee
brown
sugar
and
a
soft
hop
bitterness
i
think
the
lack
of
hop
bitterness
and
at
the
same
time
the
lack
of
malt
grain
taste
enables
the
other
flavors
to
really
stand
out
to
me
and
add
to
this
beer
in
a
positive
way
if
you
asked
me
what
the
abv
of
this
beer
was
i
couldnt
tell
you
honestly
i
cant
really
taste
the
alcohol
overall
im
very
impressed
with
the
taste
of
this
brew
and
i
will
be
chalking
this
up
on
my
top
barleywine
list
great
job
green
flash
brewing
company
long
time
since
id
had
a
barley
wine
well
worth
the
wait
doa
overall
pretty
goodabove
average
bw
i
would
not
hesitate
to
drink
this
again
o
im
not
impressed
with
this
beer
its
palatable
but
lacks
any
pizazz
wont
buy
again
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
stronger
beer
to
drink
on
for
a
long
time
and
while
its
not
a
terribly
high
abv
this
beer
is
more
of
a
sipper
because
it
improves
greatly
as
it
warms
this
beer
poured
reddish
brown
smelled
of
hops
and
molasses
the
taste
was
different
from
the
other
barley
wines
i
have
had
it
had
a
good
bit
of
a
hops
taste
to
it
but
it
also
still
had
that
typical
slight
fruitness
of
most
barely
wines
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
not
hesitate
to
get
it
again
i
havent
had
anything
from
this
brewery
yet
that
i
have
disliked
overall
this
was
an
excellent
barley
wine
would
defiantly
buy
it
again
to
share
with
friends
hardcore
traditional
barleywiners
may
be
critical
of
what
they
find
here
this
one
is
certainly
unique
everything
about
it
i
like
and
its
going
down
alarmingly
quick
another
notch
in
gfs
bedpost
its
definitely
worth
another
to
set
aside
for
a
year
or
so
and
see
how
it
ages
great
economy
barley
wine
nice
amber
hue
very
bubbly
smells
of
hops
smooth
drinking
the
10

abv
is
well
hidden
not
up
there
with
cockeyed
cooper
or
mirror
mirror
but
a
very
nice
barley
wine
non
the
less
i
may
update
the
review
later
time
for
work
oa
good
but
not
great
barleywine
that
i
would
purchase
again
deep
deep
red
thick
head
that
lasts
smells
like
a
brewery
but
i
dont
detect
anything
specific
very
deep
strong
flavors
of
wood
and
barley
strong
enough
to
mask
the
alcohol
but
it
dries
out
the
mouth
a
bit
very
interesting
worth
a
try
but
too
strong
for
my
palate
drinkability
this
is
a
sipping
beer
not
a
drinking
beer
i
would
not
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
an
evening
due
simply
to
the
high
abv
id
say
that
its
somewhat
memorable
and
has
a
good
wow
factor
due
to
the
invigorating
intensity
of
the
hops
hit
a
good
value
for
the
money
and
easy
to
drink
means
ill
have
one
of
these
again
every
once
in
a
while
o
really
good
american
style
barleywine
especially
for
the
high
abv
prosit
1406
overall
an
aggressive
but
enjoyable
american
barleywine
i
could
see
this
benefiting
from
a
year
of
age
o
pretty
good
this
one
can
be
dangerous
as
its
an
easy
drinker
good
thing
i
only
have
1
bottle
i
like
what
im
getting
sip
after
sip
skål
o
i
really
liked
this
barleywine
awesome
balance
of
everythung
and
looked
fantastic
i
may
edit
and
add
info
after
i
finish
the
other
half
with
a
maduro
cigar
on
our
55
degree
night
o
this
need
another
year
or
two
on
it
to
bring
out
some
complexities
and
dumb
down
the
sloventalcohol
bite
overall
not
a
bad
barleywine
far
from
perfect
examples
like
bigfoot
or
st
backburner
but
with
a
fairly
strong
hop
base
and
warming
11
this
barleywine
is
far
from
forgettable
from
a
22
oz
bottle
about
4
99
at
total
wine
into
a
chilled
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
orangebrown
with
a
thick
head
tastes
rich
and
full
with
citrus
overtones
and
pine
undertones
with
an
ipalike
bitterness
some
caramel
flavoring
underneath
its
a
lot
to
take
but
tasty
nonetheless
o
not
the
most
drinkable
barleywine
but
interesting
nonetheless
o
looked
and
smelled
great
just
didnt
taste
good
will
try
again
in
the
future
just
to
see
if
i
was
unlucky
and
purchased
a
bad
bottle
all
in
all
a
really
enjoyable
barleywine
the
flavors
are
dynamic
pleasant
and
marry
well
together
however
another
year
or
two
may
allow
the
flavors
to
turn
a
bit
richer
to
match
the
aromas
o
i
really
cant
wait
to
have
the
2010
and
2011s
i
am
definetly
going
to
have
them
a
little
later
on
though
maybe
in
3yrs
if
you
have
any
09s
i
reccomend
holding
them
for
a
bit
longer
o
for
the
most
part
the
alcohol
is
masked
from
the
taste
however
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
sipped
given
its
strength
and
fullbodied
nature
overall
a
nice
beer
would
drink
it
again
o
enjoyable
but
not
my
favorite
barleywine
bigfoot
and
taps
are
more
my
style
overall
too
much
for
me
the
beer
pours
a
brownamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
alcohol
and
the
brown
sugar
i
also
get
some
pine
from
the
hops
and
some
dark
fruit
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
some
cherry
and
plum
notes
as
well
as
some
pine
toffee
alcohol
and
brown
sugar
low
to
medium
bitterness
and
a
decent
amount
of
warming
from
the
alcohol
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
a
very
tasty
american
barleywine
o
decent
but
not
memorable
if
you
like
barleys
and
havent
tried
this
one
you
shouldnt
pass
it
up
o
overall
it
is
an
average
barleywine
a
bit
hopppier
than
i
like
a
barleywine
but
some
may
thoroughly
enjoy
this
worth
the
money
but
not
something
id
likely
purchase
again
o
a
westcoast
barleywine
if
there
ever
was
one
big
hoppy
additions
to
a
solid
style
base
worth
a
try
if
you
like
your
beers
with
the
hops
kicked
up
a
notch
overall
he
had
made
a
very
good
suggestion
and
the
5
75
i
paid
for
this
bomber
was
totally
worth
it
btw
thank
god
for
spell
check
after
the
abv
in
this
one
o
surprisingly
soft
for
the
strength
of
the
booze
on
your
palate
with
a
flavor
profile
balanced
between
sweet
bitter
and
booze
overall
impression
i
liked
it
fresh
i
like
it
now
and
i
think
it
could
go
for
a
few
more
years
with
ease
this
was
worth
the
time
for
the
aging
i
will
look
for
this
and
cellar
a
5
or
6
of
these
i
highly
recommend
that
you
add
this
to
your
cellar
the
beer
seems
to
be
less
sweet
than
i
recall
pine
and
alcohol
now
play
prominent
roles
still
some
toffee
but
not
as
much
orange
is
noticeable
in
the
aroma
but
not
in
the
taste
a
nice
tasting
beer
this
is
good
but
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
still
worth
a
try
and
one
which
id
be
happy
to
have
again
this
pours
a
dark
dark
amber
color
a
nice
offwhite
thick
head
forms
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
but
leaves
its
present
felt
by
lacing
the
sides
of
the
glass
constant
streams
of
carbonation
bubbles
travel
to
the
top
for
the
first
510
minutes
my
nose
capture
smells
of
bitter
chocolate
caramel
small
hints
of
bourbon
and
a
sweet
alcohol
smell
taste
of
caramel
butterscotch
bitter
hops
and
slight
aftertaste
of
chocolate
also
the
alcohol
lets
itself
be
known
the
mouthful
is
what
i
would
expect
of
a
barleywine
very
well
carbonated
too
overall
im
enjoying
this
beer
i
think
i
would
prefer
this
one
fresh
as
i
can
taste
the
diminishing
hop
flavor
and
im
a
hophead
so
i
may
seek
a
2011
vintage
bottle
out
and
compare
overall
this
one
sits
heavy
and
has
a
lot
of
heat
to
it
but
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
and
is
pretty
damn
tasty
my
overall
impression
a
strongly
above
average
barleywine
but
not
the
best
ive
had
i
would
definitely
consider
having
it
again
after
it
had
some
time
to
age
drinkability
this
beer
isnt
meant
to
be
consumed
in
large
quantities
so
drinkability
is
exactly
what
it
should
be
rather
low
but
as
to
whether
it
was
enjoyable
and
is
worth
a
purchase
absolutely
if
you
enjoy
darker
heavier
beers
especially
barley
wines
this
is
a
great
example
not
as
hoppy
as
other
american
barley
wines
but
rather
something
in
between
a
british
and
american
interpretation
rich
complex
and
worth
a
try
damn
good
brew
future
outlook
enjoyed
this
08
version
enough
that
i
might
have
to
grab
a
newer
vintage
to
stow
away
for
a
few
years
mouth
is
complex
and
sticky
amazingly
bright
in
the
mouth
for
the
hiigh
abv
as
many
barleywines
dangerously
drinkable
a
lovely
beer
that
i
could
either
sip
or
drink
all
day
overall
very
impressed
i
like
what
green
flash
has
done
with
this
one
of
my
favorite
styles
not
exactly
true
to
style
but
very
much
true
to
spirit
22
ounce
bottle
2008
vintage
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
redcopper
color
with
almost
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
aroma
is
caramel
malt
toffee
and
some
pine
and
citrusy
hops
i
think
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
theres
also
a
bittersweet
finish
although
i
think
at
this
point
for
both
the
flavor
and
the
aroma
that
the
malt
is
stronger
than
the
hops
in
this
brew
the
hops
are
still
quite
noticable
and
havent
totally
faded
away
yet
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
and
a
bit
sticky
and
coating
drinkability
is
good
its
easy
enough
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
solid
overall
brew
this
is
one
to
work
up
to
if
youre
just
trying
out
barleywines
reminded
me
of
the
rogue
old
crustacean
only
less
strong
d
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
the
aging
smoothed
is
out
quite
nicely
the
beer
was
perfect
for
the
cold
night
i
drank
it
on
overall
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
this
was
unbalanced
and
overall
pretty
weak
but
overall
was
pretty
unoffensive
maybe
this
is
better
fresh
but
there
are
too
many
other
barleywines
that
leave
this
in
the
dust
for
me
to
buy
another
this
is
a
chestnut
colored
beer
with
a
very
slight
head
it
smells
intensely
of
hops
soapy
cheesy
herbal
hops
malt
is
prominent
in
the
scent
as
well
toasted
and
breadlike
pale
malts
melanoidinladen
scents
the
taste
is
firmly
bitter
with
a
lot
of
malt
flavor
american
style
for
sure
its
rich
and
intense
not
quite
as
complex
as
many
of
the
style
but
it
is
powerful
and
rich
full
in
body
and
solidly
good
very
good
looking
brew
fresh
citrus
hops
in
the
nose
full
on
toffee
bomb
extremely
balanced
especially
a
semi
fresh
one
from
the
west
coast
d
i
think
it
matched
well
with
my
dinner
but
i
probably
would
not
drink
it
again
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
mixed
well
with
the
heavy
meats
in
the
meal
poured
into
a
large
glass
and
watched
the
creamy
head
pile
up
smelled
what
turned
out
to
be
caramel
and
toffee
notes
the
taste
was
outstanding
this
is
exactly
what
i
like
in
a
barleywine
the
sweet
toffee
and
caramel
taste
with
just
a
hint
of
citrus
made
this
beer
dangerously
drinkable
fortunately
i
was
sharing
the
large
bottle
outstanding
d
barley
wine
has
never
been
my
favorite
style
but
ive
had
a
few
different
ones
lately
and
am
quickly
falling
in
love
with
them
at
6
00
a
bomber
this
is
a
really
fine
ale
notes
on
the
hoppy
side
of
the
barleywine
range
maybe
like
an
american
barleywine
ought
to
be
but
still
it
makes
for
a
brew
that
although
strong
on
the
hop
profile
offers
a
pleasing
malty
backbone
it
sure
lacks
nuances
and
complexities
but
while
not
really
memorable
it
is
a
good
choice
d
i
can
finish
a
bomber
alone
which
is
a
plus
2008
vintage
this
is
a
fine
barleywine
that
combines
the
big
hop
notes
of
the
west
coast
and
the
dark
fruit
notes
of
the
english
style
i
felt
a
couple
years
really
helped
meld
the
large
flavours
inherent
in
this
beer
but
another
couple
in
the
cellar
would
improve
it
even
more
the
finish
is
long
and
the
hops
are
still
there
to
give
the
beer
some
real
life
in
the
mouthfeel
i
am
glad
i
have
a
couple
more
of
these
in
the
cellar
glassware
tulip
d
very
good
i
really
liked
this
one
and
found
it
very
easy
to
drink
a
good
barleywine
highly
drinkable
now
but
im
not
too
confident
about
how
this
might
have
tasted
when
fresh
back
in
09
d
impressive
for
10
quite
dangerous
actually
as
i
would
have
no
problem
finishing
the
bomber
i
plan
to
enjoy
this
frequently
this
beer
just
gets
better
in
the
mouthfeel
creamy
but
still
with
a
sharp
hop
bite
full
body
with
a
lighter
carbonation
and
a
sweet
yet
dry
finish
im
in
love
and
on
the
way
to
a
great
beer
buzz
because
the
abv
is
masked
by
awesomeness
this
was
a
2010
bottle
that
ive
aged
for
a
few
months
before
opening
if
you
see
it
buy
it
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
and
my
new
favorite
in
the
style
great
drinkability
on
this
frigid
oregon
new
years
eve
sipping
and
enjoying
every
last
heating
moment
pours
a
murky
almost
brown
dark
red
color
with
a
medium
almost
tan
offwhite
color
head
the
aroma
is
lots
of
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruits
i
also
get
hints
of
alcohol
and
toffee
im
picking
up
a
bit
of
maple
syrup
and
strong
malt
profile
as
well
smell
is
very
inviting
taste
yep
this
is
an
american
barleywine
alright
sweet
candied
dark
fruits
linger
throughout
the
whole
sip
strong
malt
flavors
with
caramel
toffee
brown
sugar
and
molasses
it
also
finishes
with
some
tasty
citrus
flavors
and
bitter
hoppiness
tasty
brew
mouthfeel
is
very
fullbodied
and
not
really
too
crisp
or
syrupy
kinda
hangin
out
between
the
two
drinkability
is
fairly
high
seeing
as
i
love
me
some
barleywines
just
as
long
as
the
abv
doesnt
catch
up
to
me
d
nice
fairly
hoppy
barleywine
nothing
over
the
top
but
a
solid
beer
bright
red
with
2
fingers
of
sticky
white
head
the
carmel
bready
citrusy
burnt
hopps
reeminds
me
of
bigfoot
just
like
the
smell
i
bet
these
hops
fresh
would
almost
over
the
top
but
wonderfull
as
is
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
sizeable
but
not
over
the
top
drinks
fairly
easy
considering
its
nearly
11
abv
i
really
like
this
barleywine
i
am
very
excited
i
have
another
one
md
full
bodied
smooth
and
minimally
carbonated
this
beers
is
a
sipper
a
22oz
bomber
of
this
and
im
good
i
am
a
hop
lover
so
this
barleywine
was
right
up
my
alley
however
i
do
prefer
barleywines
to
be
big
complex
malt
bombs
this
definitely
has
the
huge
malts
to
back
up
the
ridiculous
amount
of
hops
this
is
a
brew
to
be
appreciated
and
respected
its
very
good
very
happy
i
have
a
few
more
bottles
to
see
how
this
tastes
when
the
hops
fade
over
the
next
few
years
time
to
begin
a
vertical
drink
im
not
a
huge
barleywine
fan
but
this
one
struck
me
as
pretty
decent
ill
certainly
have
to
grab
a
few
to
cellar
drinkabilityenormously
tasty
but
a
huge
abv
brings
down
drinkability
a
tad
excellent
single
serving
try
it
with
stilton
cheese
dark
chocolate
and
some
fruit
md
10
9
abv
is
undetectable
here
the
sweetness
might
be
offputting
towards
the
end
still
an
excellent
barleywine
worth
the
price
of
admission
picked
this
up
in
illinois
over
thanksgiving
somewhat
similar
to
bigfoot
this
bottle
had
been
on
the
shelf
for
a
while
but
held
up
pretty
well
nice
barleywine
sweetness
with
enough
hops
to
give
it
some
legs
mouth
is
fairly
heavy
not
quite
syrupy
this
is
a
pleasure
to
sip
good
beer
this
is
a
good
barleywine
but
i
remember
liking
the
bottle
better
which
was
a
surprise
would
like
to
get
a
couple
more
years
on
it
d
the
alcohol
really
doesnt
overpower
for
11
abv
in
the
taste
you
feel
it
fast
enough
solidly
drinkable
for
the
style
as
the
alcohol
is
unnoticeable
in
the
taste
and
the
malts
and
hops
are
well
balanced
overall
a
pretty
good
barleywine
although
nothing
groundbreaking
certainly
worth
a
try
though
d
this
is
no
session
beer
thats
for
sure
loving
every
minute
of
it
but
cant
give
superhigh
marks
in
the
drinkability
dept
thanks
to
green
flash
for
this
d
i
finished
it
but
would
not
buy
another
2009
vintage
picked
this
bomber
up
for
less
than
5
a
pretty
reasonable
price
indeed
for
a
barley
wine
of
this
caliber
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
big
fluffy
tan
head
nice
big
hoppy
nose
with
pine
needles
earthy
hops
and
some
light
maltiness
this
one
is
very
drinkable
almost
like
a
dipa
pine
citrus
a
little
caramel
but
no
noticeable
alcohol
whatsoever
although
the
label
tells
me
it
is
there
a
very
nice
barleywine
especially
at
that
price
point
but
not
up
there
with
the
greats
big
boozey
beast
reminds
me
of
a
whiskey
very
tasty
but
could
benefit
from
some
more
aging
to
take
some
of
the
bite
out
of
the
alcohol
and
smooth
it
out
a
bit
big
bitterness
d
a
good
barleywine
that
has
smoothed
out
pretty
well
thus
far
could
even
use
a
bit
more
time
to
age
but
it
is
tasty
now
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
a
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
light
brown
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
crown
with
a
light
smattering
of
bubbles
on
top
of
the
beer
smell
has
a
healthy
dose
of
malts
up
front
with
some
definite
sweetness
and
alcohol
as
well
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malts
and
alcohol
feel
has
crisp
carbonation
with
the
warming
alcohol
medium
to
full
bodied
overall
a
very
good
drinking
barleywine
md
fullbodied
lightly
warming
softly
carbonated
all
in
all
a
surprisingly
easy
drinking
and
richly
hoppy
barley
wine
or
more
like
a
darker
dipa
to
be
honest
with
good
potential
to
age
a
nice
american
barleywine
lots
of
flavour
here
and
a
nice
interplay
between
hops
and
malt
d
although
this
beer
is
indeed
drinkable
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
night
pretty
good
but
not
the
best
green
flash
has
to
offer
and
not
my
new
favorite
barleywine
m
d
this
beer
is
actually
quite
delicious
and
very
well
balanced
for
a
barleywine
even
though
the
flavors
are
intense
very
drinkable
it
is
a
bit
dry
int
he
body
but
still
good
and
refreshing
2009
vintage
22oz
bottle
into
a
hopus
glass
pours
a
murky
muddy
copper
with
a
thin
khaki
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
and
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
a
nice
balance
of
burnt
caramel
and
citrus
and
pine
hops
the
taste
is
loads
of
burnt
caramel
and
slight
dried
fruits
with
a
nice
kick
of
pine
hops
leaving
a
nice
bitter
finish
the
beer
is
a
bit
heavy
with
slight
sticky
alcohol
but
it
is
a
relatively
easy
sipper
this
is
a
respectable
barleywine
one
i
would
like
to
try
with
more
than
one
years
age
on
it
smooth
silky
mouthfeel
with
some
dryness
at
the
finish
d
the
malt
flavor
is
nice
but
buried
under
the
alcohol
heat
and
hops
age
might
help
the
hops
and
alcohol
settle
down
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
just
grows
and
grows
whereas
the
other
flavors
do
not
wow
a
little
over
the
top
but
more
in
the
way
of
excess
than
excellent
poured
with
a
nice
foamy
frothy
thick
tan
head
and
a
little
lace
color
is
a
pretty
clear
orange
red
amber
aroma
is
massive
malt
and
hop
with
yeast
and
fruit
plus
fruit
rind
flavors
like
aroma
and
very
bitter
without
hardly
any
sweetness
body
is
full
and
carbonation
is
good
finish
is
like
flavor
and
quite
long
with
the
bitterness
lingering
for
a
while
an
appertif
maybe
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
one
finger
frothy
head
which
gives
way
to
some
decent
patchy
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
a
caramel
malt
backbone
with
a
slight
dark
fruit
presence
finished
off
with
some
piney
and
citrus
hops
the
taste
has
a
caramel
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
toffee
present
the
middle
of
the
beer
has
a
slight
dark
fruit
characteristic
and
the
end
is
finished
off
with
piney
hops
and
a
slight
citrus
hop
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
low
carbonation
and
creamy
the
drinkability
is
good
the
alcohol
burn
is
non
existant
there
is
a
nice
malt
backbone
blended
well
with
the
hops
it
is
an
easy
drink
for
a
barelywine
the
flavor
is
slightly
smashed
together
however
it
is
a
good
barelywine
overall
this
was
a
nice
bw
and
also
another
quality
offering
from
green
flash
thanks
again
jeff
pours
a
deep
orange
colour
with
a
thick
white
head
and
lacing
all
down
the
glass
smell
had
lots
of
citrus
hops
and
caramel
malt
just
as
youd
expect
in
a
west
coast
barleywine
a
wonderful
balance
of
the
malt
and
hops
in
the
taste
im
noticing
some
pine
flavour
that
i
wasnt
getting
as
much
in
the
smell
before
taking
a
sip
very
nicely
carbonated
and
drinkable
i
got
through
this
beer
much
quicker
than
i
thought
and
im
glad
i
bought
a
2nd
bottle
robust
hoppiness
hits
the
tongue
first
theres
a
strong
pine
flavor
undertones
of
grapefruit
flesh
and
peel
dark
fruit
earthy
notes
of
tobacco
and
leather
alcohol
is
briefly
noticeable
midpalate
quite
dry
overall
theres
a
strong
malt
character
but
its
more
earthy
leathery
moderately
toasty
mediumbodied
with
a
dry
bitter
and
hoppy
finish
with
faint
sherrylike
oxidation
this
has
aged
pretty
gracefully
drinkability
is
average
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
it
could
sneak
up
on
you
quick
overall
a
very
nice
beer
you
should
try
this
when
you
see
it
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
barleywine
it
is
much
hoppier
than
most
barleywines
at
the
sacrifice
of
some
of
the
normal
spicy
complexities
of
a
barleywine
it
is
certainly
interesting
both
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
considering
the
relatively
high
carbonation
overall
i
would
say
it
was
enjoyable
and
had
no
problem
finishing
the
bottle
d
i
think
this
would
be
a
pretty
good
beer
if
it
wasnt
for
the
overbearing
green
apple
flavor
that
absolutely
doesnt
fit
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
hot
boozey
mess
even
after
some
aging
this
is
the
first
beer
from
green
flash
ive
truly
been
disappointed
with
i
think
they
need
to
revise
this
beer
d
just
noticed
this
at
the
local
beer
store
the
other
day
have
been
sucked
in
by
the
dipa
and
ipas
from
green
flash
before
but
now
this
2008
might
need
to
come
home
with
me
dont
think
they
well
hold
up
for
another
year
though
but
who
said
anything
about
waiting
to
drink
them
drinkablility
very
enjoyable
and
quite
drinkable
maintains
a
good
up
front
malt
balance
with
sharp
hoppy
kick
on
the
back
end
a
rather
enjoyable
barley
that
probably
even
after
2
and
half
years
could
even
with
stand
a
bit
more
aging
to
be
mellowed
further
a
good
effort
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
but
not
watery
its
pretty
harsh
to
drink
hop
bitterness
with
not
alot
of
flavor
from
either
malt
or
hops
d
barely
drinkable
due
to
the
aboveandbeyond
booze
factor
im
not
sure
that
aging
will
help
this
vintage
not
at
all
enjoyable
d
the
most
enjoyable
part
of
this
brew
is
certainly
the
nose
though
the
taste
is
not
far
behind
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
if
found
in
my
area
would
be
a
staple
in
the
ol
refrigerator
overall
its
enjoyable
but
not
as
big
on
fresh
hops
as
id
like
verdict
green
flashs
barleywine
has
the
typical
american
barleywine
character
of
bitter
hops
over
sweet
caramel
malt
a
solid
example
of
the
style
note
this
beer
is
now
listed
2009
vintage
at
10
9
abv
not
10
id
like
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
of
this
i
know
some
barleywines
age
very
well
but
this
one
appears
not
to
have
green
flash
is
good
for
two
things
making
great
west
coast
style
beers
and
making
a
few
surprises
every
now
and
then
this
is
very
similar
to
previous
batches
of
sierra
nevadas
big
foot
this
is
a
text
book
example
of
how
the
west
does
their
barley
wine
d
definitely
a
beer
that
should
be
tried
especially
if
you
enjoy
what
green
flash
has
to
offer
or
enjoy
an
interesting
take
on
american
barleywine
i
sat
down
with
this
guy
for
a
bit
to
try
and
work
through
its
signatures
and
after
a
while
got
them
down
i
think
for
me
at
least
but
it
should
be
noted
that
it
has
an
alcoholic
bite
and
should
not
be
taken
lightly
all
in
all
enjoy
one
bomber
and
done
the
sticky
viscous
mouthfeel
and
makes
this
a
bomber
and
done
for
me
mouthfeel
is
creamy
mediumfull
bodied
with
some
nice
weight
on
the
tongue
very
drinkable
for
such
a
boozy
assertive
beer
strong
enough
to
keep
you
from
gulping
but
balanced
enough
to
keep
you
sipping
d
it
gets
a
little
saccharine
after
8oz
or
so
so
i
dont
think
id
want
to
drink
a
bomber
on
my
own
the
alcohol
buzz
also
creeps
up
fairly
quickly
otherwise
its
a
pretty
enjoyable
barleywine
not
sure
if
there
was
bad
batchvintage
because
this
tastes
much
better
than
some
of
the
recent
reviews
would
indicate
d
im
not
a
fan
of
oxidation
and
autolysis
flavors
but
the
beers
flavor
grows
on
me
its
a
pleasant
malty
taste
overall
a
nice
representation
of
the
american
barleywine
because
its
fairly
priced
i
may
just
seek
out
another
08
and
lay
it
down
for
a
year
cheers
green
flash
taste
has
an
alcohol
bite
at
first
and
then
smooths
out
burnt
caramel
malt
pepper
some
spice
and
hops
in
the
back
ends
nicely
bitter
d
overall
easy
drinking
unique
by
its
amount
of
caramel
malt
the
200
vintage
was
an
interesting
buy
but
i
wouldnt
go
into
a
beer
store
with
the
sole
purpose
of
purchasing
this
beer
but
its
a
good
beer
for
a
sampling
session
overall
a
good
example
of
an
american
barleywine
though
not
my
favorite
style
this
one
is
quite
good
i
like
it
much
better
than
sierra
nevadas
bigfoot
ale
which
is
a
pretty
favored
one
of
its
kind
another
lower
ranked
barley
wine
style
ale
that
impressed
me
this
one
is
a
dark
caramel
color
with
an
antique
white
cream
cap
big
caramel
and
toffee
notes
in
the
aroma
with
a
boozy
character
only
slightly
hidden
nice
heavy
mouthfeel
lively
on
the
tongue
offering
notes
of
fresh
toffee
brittle
barrelaged
brandy
brown
sugar
encrusted

and
dried
fruit
jam
great
example
and
great
priceyou
get
alotta
bang
for
your
buck
here
a
pleasure
and
a
treat
recommended
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
filmy
and
smooth
strength
of
the
alcohol
taste
reduces
drinkability
rich
and
full

finishes
with
a
tingle
and
an
alcoholic
warmth
tasty
beer
good
sipper
drinkability
is
sort
of
down
on
this
one
sort
of
a
wet
finish
that
doesnt
beg
for
the
next
sip
its
strong
and
heavy
slower
drink
than
a
lot
of
big
beers
of
the
sort
sometimes
the
high
abv
will
get
me
to
chug
through
faster
but
not
here
its
an
adequate
example
of
the
style
barleywines
are
a
style
where
a
decently
executed
one
is
still
better
than
a
lot
of
beers
in
a
lot
of
other
styles
value
is
pretty
good
for
a
bomber
so
that
bumps
the
score
a
touch
drinkability
is
great
i
would
love
to
crack
open
a
2008
to
compare
but
this
beer
is
10
however
i
had
no
problem
finishing
this
bomber
must
to
try
this
next
to
other
examples
of
the
style
that
i
hold
in
high
regard
i
would
not
be
shocked
if
i
had
to
edit
some
reviews
due
to
such
a
tasting
event
d
enjoyable
not
something
id
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
in
a
sitting
and
not
something
id
reach
for
very
often
ill
check
this
vintage
out
in
a
few
years
to
see
what
its
doing
then
i
kind
of
expected
more
out
of
this
one
drinkability
i
didnt
really
plan
on
cellaring
this
but
im
not
upset
about
it
the
tamed
hops
makes
this
more
like
an
english
barleywine
but
its
really
good
very
heavy
but
refined
a
decent
drinker
but
over
the
top
need
some
aging
a
young
tasting
beer
but
age
will
not
assist
the
flat

one
to
try
but
not
again
given
other

bitter
and
a
little
rough
upfront
would
probably
smooth
out
after
at

a
year
of

but
if
the

doesnt

it
wont
taste
much
better

quite
a
nice

well
crafted
and
enjoyable
definitely
more
us
barleywine
with
the

d
tough

a

better
shared
with
another
person

quite
good

throat
and

md
a
nice

and
a
smooth

beer
a
standard
quality
barleywine
nothing
to
extraordinary
but
there
is
no
lacking
in
any
element
a
great
standby
bw
d
moderate
no
joke
a
true
barleywine
the
sweetness
got
to
me
after
a
while
but
the
hops
helped
this
one
ease
along
id
seek
this
one
out
again
for
sure
but
id
let
it
sit
for
35
years
at
least
this
one
begs
to
be
aged
dno
thanks
wont
drink
this
again
this
was
close
to
a
drain
pour
and
would
have
been
if
it
had
not
improved
as
it
warmed
demanding
day
at
work
so
i
enjoyed
the
buzz
if
ability
to
produce
a
buzz
were
a
review
characteristic
this
would
rate
high
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
2006
vintage
poured
into
my
sly
fox
shaker
glass
appears
the
color
of
cloudy
fresh
brewed
iced
tea
with
an
inch
of
creamy
rust
colored
foam
the
head
leaves
a
thick
lace
covering
the
entire
inside
of
my
glass
opposite
of
where
im
sippin
from
flavors
and
aromas
consist
of
prunes
quite
bitter
at
first
alcohol
is
not
very
apparent
at
this
age
toffee
bitter
citrus
peel
dark
caramel
falls
somewhere
between
medium
and
full
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
levels
aftertaste
is
a
bit
bitter
overall
id
say
this
one
held
up
pretty
well
and
could
go
a
bit
longer
in
the
cellar
as
a
whole
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
compared
to
a
majority
of
barleywines
available
id
say
its
only
slightly
above
average
poured
a
brownish
amber
color
with
good
carbonation
and
a
tan
head
nose
is
caramel
toffee
and
some
pine
taste
has
shifted
toward
a
big
caramel
toffee
presence
but
the
abv
is
still
strong
and
so
is
the
hop
profile
mouthfeel
is
balanced
creamy
sweet
and
delicous
damn
good
at
2
years
overall
not
right
d
its
not
as
smooth
as
i
would
want
my
barleywines
the
grassy
hops
take
away
the
drinkability
either
way
you
want
to
sip
this
one
overall
a
good
brew
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
bite
of
alcohol
d
dissapointing
flavor
and
the
incredibl
presence
of
booze
make
this
beer
not
all
that
drinkable
notes
this
is
just
a
boozy
mess
of
a
beer
that
completely
fails
to
work
in
harmony
right
now
its
a
shame
because
there
are
some
really
good
flavors
in
here
too
that
vodkalike
ethanol
just
wore
me
down
and
made
it
a
chore
to
get
through
even
a
glass
and
considering
that
i
am
a
cheapass
bastard
in
the
worst
way
it
takes
a
lot
for
a
beer
to
become
a
drainpour
unfortunately
this
one
pushed
me
past
the
threshold
and
the
rest
met
its
fate
at
the
bottom
of
my
kitchen
sink
what
the
hell
happened
here
green
flash
makes
excellent
beers
but
this
just
wasnt
one
of
them
will
have
to
revisit
this
to
ensure
that
i
didnt
get
a
bad
bottle
green
flash
barleywine
style
ale
isnt
the
best
american
barleywine
on
the
block
but
it
does
more
right
than
it
does
wrong
if
you
like
caramel
malt
citric
hops
and
doubledigit
abvs
give
this
one
a
whirl
bottom
line
it
aint
flashy
but
its
as
solid
as
granite
good
mouthfeel
lots
of
booze
and
the
whole
barleywine
qualities
keep
it
from
being
too
drinkable
d
id
say
its
about
middling
when
fresh
a
bomber
is
kind
of
a
bad
idea
alone
and
fresh
but
id
certainly
enjoy
having
this
again
after
aging
it
to
let
it
cool
off
one
of
the
most
hopforward
barley
wines
i
have
had
it
is
green
flash
though
so
its
not
too
surprising
also
a
big
kick
of
alcohol
and
bitterness
some
citrus
and
caramel
malts
burns
a
little
on
the
way
down
above
average
but
not
very
good
either
clear
ruddy
medium
brown
with
a
small
tan
creamy
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
a
thick
lasting
film
excellent
lacing
the
smell
is
of
heavenly
pungent
hops
so
resiny
with
whisps
of
citrus
and
dark
fruit
encircling
a
solid
sweet
smelling
malt
backbone
damn
this
smells
huge
and
good
the
taste
is
not
as
huge
up
front
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
as
it
warms
in
the
mouth
the
complexity
comes
through
then
the
alcohol
warmth
start
to
show
up
building
toward
the
alcoholheavy
finish
coming
back
for
more
sips
the
aroma
that
i
initially
found
to
be
so
enticing
is
now
a
bit
overbearing
in
a
way
still
good
though
it
has
a
full
body
a
dry
warm
lightlysyrupy
texture
and
low
carbonation
this
one
started
out
with
high
marks
but
then
fizzled
a
little
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
harsh
and
this
is
coming
from
somebody
that
loves
big
beers
i
had
just
had
an
old
guardian
the
day
before
this
one
probably
has
more
complexity
but
just
isnt
as
wellrounded
i
know
a
big
beer
like
this
going
to
be
cloying
and
im
going
to
enjoy
tasting
this
for
several
hours
after
finishing
the
bottle
but
this
one
is
just
a
little
too
much
still
definitely
worth
a
try
though
green
flash
came
seemingly
out
of
nowhere
with
a
bunch
of
beers
at
all
the
most
popular
styles
tripel
double
ipa
barley
wine
ipa
as
well
as
some
unique
combos
this
beer
is
as
good
as
any
of
their
beers
with
a
good
west
coast
take
on
the
style
good
alcohol
content
great
color
and
good
carbonation
worth
the
price
tag
if
you
can
find
it
deep
caramel
in
body
with
soft
offwhite
head
pleasant
aroma
of
caramel
dark
fruits
booze
sugar
alcoholic
booze
starts
the
drink
and
stays
the
whole
way
through
caramel
sweets
malted
grain
toffee
burnt
sugar
hop
resiny
finish
heavy
body
intense
on
the
palate
and
big
on
the
belly
definitly
a
night
capper
but
doesnt
quite
go
that
well
in
the
summer
heat
i
love
a
good
american
barleywine
but
even
after
a
year
this
beer
was
too
hot
the
mix
of
the
alcohol
and
sweetness
just
seem
to
fight
each
other
and
neither
wins
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
but
this
beer
just
does
not
meld
well
it
seems
very
rough
an
choppy
tasting
hard
to
explain
i
love
green
flash
but
this
was
not
their
best
work
imo
11oz
sampling
pours
a
thick
caramel
brown
color
with
a
huge
frothy
beige
head
smells
sweet
with
a
pleasant
waft
of
caramel
and
toffee
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
overwhelming
some
piny
citrus
scents
also
fill
the
nose
tastes
are
full
and
extremely
bold
caramel
toffee
alcohol
with
citrus
and
pine
on
the
finish
as
the
ale
warms
hints
of
ripe
mango
peek
through
the
pine
overtones
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
and
coats
the
palate
well
finishes
bitter
but
sweet
as
the
malts
hold
up
to
the
large
dose
of
hops
in
this
west
coast
version
of
an
american
barleywine
this
was
exactly
as
i
expected
it
to
be
and
a
very
good
interpretation
of
the
style
especially
speaking
in
west
coast
terms
purchased
from
ledgers
liquors
in
summer
2007
and
aged
in
my
cellar
for
the
last
couple
of
years
by
this
point
it
has
lost
all
of
its
hops
but
still
has
quite
vibrant
malt
in
the
nose
along
with
some
nice
apple
notes
with
a
vigorous
pour
there
is
also
quite
a
healthy
head
and
a
modicum
of
lacing
nice
after
a
couple
of
years
the
taste
is
rich
nutty
and
honeyed
the
malt
shines
beautifully
here
amazingly
there
is
still
a
fair
hit
hops
in
the
finish
with
pine
and
bitter
orange
subtle
but
bitter
enough
to
balance
the
malt
and
toffee
notes
extremely
smooth
and
creamy
with
rich
notes
that
are
seemlessly
integrated
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
liked
this
young
and
im
usually
not
one
to
abuse
hops
by
aging
this
was
fairly
hoppy
to
begin
with
but
this
beer
has
really
really
come
together
quite
nice
labeled
as
2nd
anniversary
bottle
at
pprbsg09
pours
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
flavor
is
super
sweet
with
some
roasted
malt
and
vegetal
notes
very
heavy
on
the
palate
it
seems
that
this
one
has
not
held
up
over
time
ugh
not
a
fan
if
you
like
the
pineheavy
west
coast
hops
this
is
worth
trying
but
otherwise
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
d
this
has
some
nice
flavors
it
is
fruity
bittersweet
and
sticky
sweet
at
times
overall
the
sweetness
steals
the
show
much
like
the
american
versions
this
has
a
good
dose
of
herbal
type
hops
in
the
mix
and
they
snap
at
the
tongue
amongst
the
sweetness
nice
brew
with
plenty
of
syrupy
sweetness
cheers
like
most
barleywines
this
is
for
sipping
slowly
no
frat
boy
guzzling
here
a
serious
beer
for
serious
beer
drinkers
although
it
is
relatively
smooth
for
a
barleywine
it
still
is
a
barleywine
and
by
style
is
more
suited
for
sipping
not
bad
and
definitely
improves
as
it
warms
one
22oz
bottle
would
probably
be
the
limit
though
pours
a
very
dark
red
amber
at
points
it
almost
appears
as
though
light
does
not
pass
through
head
consists
of
a
thin
film
atop
the
deep
dark
monster
smells
sticky
piny
citrusy
malty
syrupy
sweet
standard
taste
is
very
bitter
with
a
slight
hint
of
sweet
syrupy
malt
and
some
citrus
hoppy
notes
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
pleasing
drinkability
is
great
for
a
brew
this
size
definitely
a
sipper
by
definition
and
style
but
i
would
seek
this
out
when
needing
some
extra
octane
green
flash
rides
again
d
tasty
but
i
would
not
reach
for
a
second
bomber
a
bit
much
on
the
taste
buds
solid
beer
for
just
haveing
one
though
pours
a
copperruby
with
exceptional
clarity
three
finger
off
white
head
good
retention
and
soapy
lacing
nose
caramel
and

then

bready

well

carbonation
is
on
the
low
side
making
it
an
easy
sipper
a
very

nice
stuff
a
really
nice
american
barleywine
featuring
west
coast
hops
in
a
starring
role
d
it
drinks
okay
i
wouldnt
have
another
and
i
wont
buy
it
again
2008
vintage
pours
a
dark
red
to
ruby
color
with
a
well
retained
whitish
brown
head
smells
strongly
of
454infused
cherries
like
something
served
at
a
frat
party
flavor
is
a
bit
harsh
and
boozy
too
with
big
hot
alcohol
and
strong
dry
bitterness
a
fairly
nice
balanced
malt
body
is
detectable
beneath
along
with
some
cherry
and
grape
but
its
all
a
bit
buried
beneath
the
hot
alcohol
and
bitterness
full
bodied
drinkability
hurt
by
its
obvious
strength
i
think
it
just
needs
a
year
or
two
to
mellow
out
maybe
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
thick
dense
head
lots
of
lacing
down
the
glass
great
hop
aroma
grapefruit
citrus
and
toffee
malt
aromas
at
first
there
is
a
strong
malt
flavor
quickly
overtaken
by
an
intense
citrus
hop
flavor
there
are
faint
caramel
flavors
behind
the
citrus
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
very
heavy
the
odd
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
the
hops
are
so
intense
that
they
actually
sucked
the
moisture
right
out
of
my
mouth
definitely
could
have
used
a
little
mellowing
to
take
off
that
hop
edge
i
sort
of
regret
opening
it
too
soon
it
still
has
great
flavors
though
i
can
see
the
potential
i
might
have
to
pick
up
another
and
let
it
age
a
while
a
solid
barleywine
no
problem
drinking
this
one
the
taste
is
richly
malty
sufficiently
strong
but
definitely
dominated
by
the
hop
flavours
and
bitterness
its
hoppy
and
on
the
bitter
side
up
front
but
this
is
not
overpowering
and
is
complemented
by
a
strong
toffee
maltliness
then
a
ginlike
element
with
a
bitter
strong
citrusy
hop
finish
the
palate
is
somewhat
thin
for
a
barleywine
and
lively
it
has
solid
flavour
the
alcohol
is
not
too
strong
harsh
or
obvious
it
has
definite
complexity
and
its
interesting
it
first
took
a
while
to
grow
on
me
but
it
finally
did
even
though
its
not
my
favourite
barleywine
not
exactly
the
barleywine
i
was
invisioning
but
still
good
and
distinctly
american
what
good
would
a
traditional
english
style
be
in
america
unless
we
added
a
barrell
of
hops
to
it
give
this
one
a
shot
drinkability
being
a
bwine
it
isnt
highly
sessionable
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
had
many
weird
aspects
to
it
good
bwine
not
bad
verdict
im
a
big
fan
this
is
easy
to
find
and
available
yearround
perfectly
compliments
a
steak
and

d
its
big
and
its
tiring
but
good
love
the
green
flash
stuff
pours
deep
ruby
with
a
slight
head
that
falls
quickly
smells
sweet
malty
and
raisinlike
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
plummy
and
woody
with
a
strong
bite
of
alcohol
and
a
slight
flatness
in
the
middle
it
finished
with
hints
of
toffee
caramel
and
molasses
it
has
good
hopping
though
the
whole
beer
is
just
barely
in
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
viscous
with
sting
of
carbonation
good
though
not
astonishing
drinkability
is
nice
for
a
sipper
little
too
much
alcohol
just
a
tad
flavor
is
good
would
be
about
perfect
if
alcohol
was
a
touch
less
a
dark
root
beer
color
with
a
nice
oatmeal
colored
head
and
tons
of
lacing
the
aroma
shows
me
everything
good
in
beer
malty
licorice
and
pine
hops
wonderfully
merged
the
taste
is
first
overwhelmed
by
the
perfectly
creamy
full
bodied
feel
then
the
malt
and
pine
hops
flavor
come
out
and
it
is
a
great
taste
treat
theres
a
touch
of
dr
pepper
sweetness
just
a
fine
barleywine
no
doubts
d
an
interesting
brew
a
slow
drinking
sipper
to
say
the
least
an
interesting
brew
though
im
not
sure
its
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
enjoyable
and
worth
a
try
should
you
come
across
it
in
your
travels
ill
stick
with
green
flash
but
not
this
particular
style
not
drinkable
as
i
said
im
probably
not
going
to
finish
this
bomber
it
takes
a
lot
for
me
not
to
finish
a
beer
i
dont
know
why
green
flash
has
the
reputation
it
does
i
havent
had
a
single
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
from
them
but
at
least
i
was
able
to
actually
finish
those
beers
i
wont
be
finishing
this
been
an
hour
since
i
poured
it
into
my
glass
and
it
isnt
getting
any
better
with
temperature
this
brew
really
needs
to
be
enjoyed
with
a
nice
strong
cheese
or
maybe
meat
but
is
still
pretty
solid
on
its
own
tastes
very
smooth
and
malty
surprisingly
low
hop
flavor
from
green
flash
was
kinda
hoping
for
a
hop
bomb
thats
not
to
say
it
is
not
hoppy
cause
it
is
but
not
as
bright
and
citrusy
as
the
wcipa
hops
have
a
more
musty
and
cheesy
feel
to
them
and
the
beer
has
more
hop
bitterness
than
hop
flavor
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
nearly
feeling
like
10
it
is
a
good
barleywine
just
not
quite
great
d
i
see
potential
in
this
one
but
the
boozy
notes
make
it
miss
the
mark
beer

drinkability
is
good
as
the
high
alcohol
content
was
not
noticeable
at
all
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
one
whopper
of
a
beer
that
was

this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
for
its
heft
i
find
it
goes
well
with
a
nice
big
juicy
grilled
burger
with
an
extra
sharp
cheddar
or
hot

with
some
age
bomber
pours
clear
dull
copper
with
light
tan

and

it
has
a
light

rather
than
a

aroma
with
hints
of
dark

and
an
out

pine
hoppiness
as
well
as
some
alcohol
the
pine
hops
almost
smell
wet
the
flavor
starts
malty
and
slightly
sweet
with
dark
fruitiness
then
the
pine
hops
hit
pretty
hard
then
a
pinch
of
alcohol
also
surfaces
i
also
get
a
hard
citrus
candy
note
that
borders
on
being
medicinal
near
the
finish
there
are
mild
caramel
and
toffee
notes
that
feel
very
barleywine
like
i
think
this
is
worth
a
year
or
two
aging
and
a
rerate
d
this
brew
is
too
heavy
for
more
than
a

thats
what
barleywines
are
all
about

this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
great
certainly
a
green
flash
product
with
the
bold
hop
character
a
hard
pour
produces
a
dark
brown
brew
with
a
few
centimeters
of
head
that
dissipates
quickly
floral
hops
dominate
the
aroma
but
a
little
malt
manages
to
push
through
the
taste
mimics
the
aroma
but
with
a
sourish
and
slightly
acidic
aspect
to
the
experience
the
hops
make
themselves
known
through
a
floral
bitterness
that
lingers
after
the
beer
has
departed
a
little
a
too
sour
for
my
tastes
thanks
green
flash
the
lord
bless
the
hop
harvest
d
pretty
good
definitely
an
enjoyable
american
barleywine
and
im
not
going
to
have
any
problem
finishing
the
bomber
would
recommend
to
those
in
search
of
enjoyable
examples
of
the
style
not
too
extreme
in
the
flavor
department
but
i
like
that
sometimes
those
crazy
hoppy
american
barleywines
might
as
well
be
dipas
i
love
both
styles
but
this
more
relaxed
hop
character
compared
to
many
american
barleywines
is
really
doing
it
for
me
right
now
word
up
this
is
byfar
the
worst
beer
ive
had
in
recent
memory
i
can
only
hope
that
based
on
the
other
reviews
here
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
my
bottle
i
wont
be
spending
another
6
to
find
out
though
a
solid
barleywine
though
not
exceptional
great
head
and
reddish
brown
and
lacey
aroma
of
barleywine
and
hops
some
citrus
taste
a
sourish
taste
medium
mouthfeel
would
gladly
have
after
two
or
more
years
ageing
alcohol
warming
good
caramel
just
not
too
unique
interesting
brew
has
the
content
of
a
barleywine
but
is
surprisingly
light
tasting
for
the
same
scent
is
hoppy
and
acidic
strong
bitterness
in
the
taste
with
some
piney
accents
sweeter
finish
as
barleywines
go
not
my
favorite
but
it
is
a
good
beer
wow
a
really
good
brew
that
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
despite
being
this
big
one
of
the
best
american
barley
wines
best
beer
ive
ever
had
it
has
such
an
intense
hops
presence
that
i
would
guess
that
it
was
an
ipa
or
double
ipa
for
days
after
i
was
thinking
about
how
good
this
beer
was
it
does
have
a
significant
malt
flavor
but
it
is
matched
so
well
with
the
bold
hops
freshness
that
it
is
less
noticeable
i
would
say
its
the
best
balance
of
hops
and
barley
that
i
have
ever
had
making
it
a
nearly
perfect
beer
go
out
of
your
way
to
drink
this
beer
you
wont
regret
it
purchased
in
2007
no
date
on

just
vintage
cellared
until
this
evening
appearance
is
dark

hop
bitterness
is

more

sharp
but
balanced
reasonably
well
with
alcohol
and
a
caramel
sugary
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
very
smooth
and
velvety
definitely
not
a
swiller
goes
down
smooth
not
too
easy
very
fulfilling
aboveaverage
barleywine
cheers
more
complex
than
this
review
gets
across
and
very
drinkable
despite
the
bold
flavor
and
relatively
high
abv
green
flash
makes
some
serious
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
this
one
changes
a
lot
with
age
i
have
noticed
too
big
hop
profile
when
fresh
then
sweet
and
rounded
with
a
couple
years
under
its
belt
will
be
drinking
again
hope
to
try
the
brandy
barrel
version
soon
recommended
wont
be
revisiting
d
i
couldnt
even
drink
half
a
glass
had
to
pour
the
rest
out
i
know
green
flash
is
known
for
their
incredibly
hoppy
beers
and
i
like
some
of
them
but
this
one
was
just
too
out
of
whack
for
me
to
enjoy
its
a
nice
color
for
a
barleywine
there
is
some
mistiness
looking
through
the
snifter
and
a
pretty
good
head
the
nose
is
floral
and
sweet
the
flavor
is
caramel
with
a
strong
alcohol
presence
there
is
a
great
hop
flavor
with
a
good
tartness
the
hops
are
mostly
grapefruit
with
the
aforementioned
floral
notes
the
beer
has
a
pretty
good
feel
for
a
barleywine
but
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
dominant
to
enjoy
for
too
long
it
could
certainly
improve
with
age
overall
this
is
another
fantastic
beer
from
green
flash
that
is
highly
recommended
out
of
the
bottle
this
beer
was
a
deep
garnet
color
approaching
brown
the
head
was
huge
three
fingers
of
tan
bubbles
that
descended
back
to
a
rocky
cap
after
a
while
that
laced
well
the
aroma
weres
quite
nice
ripe
fruit
figs
and
raisins
rich
hops
toffee
and
alcohol
esters
the
flavors
followed
suit
i
was
first
rushed
by
the
flavors
of
fermented
cherries
and
raisins
quite
sweet
this
was
soon
followed
by
pine
and
grapefruit
notes
from
the
hops
and
at
last
the
alcohol
heat
and
caramel
malt
at
the
end
as
big
as
it
was
the
balance
was
well
struck
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
smooth
helping
to
make
it
rather
drinkable
though
sweet
it
never
became
cloying
even
as
it
warmed
up
and
i
think
the
sugars
helped
control
the
10
alcohol
punch
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
i
recommend
it
green
flash
did
a
pretty
good
job
with
this
barleywine
its
got
a
good
flavor
but
could
use
a
little
refining
the
nose
is
good
but
could
use
a
little
work
to
bring
out
more
of
the
flavors
it
has
frankly
i
love
the
strong
hoppy
flavor
but
would
be
very
interested
in
trying
this
with
some
age
to
see
how
it
gels
as
it
is
right
now
its
almost
a
little
too
hoppy
theres
a
sentence
i
never
thought
id
say
but
for
the
style
its
true
i
suspect
its
better
with
some
age
perhaps
even
dramatically
so
overall
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
although
the
alcohol
could
be
a
bit
tamer
some
additional
time
on
this
one
wouldnt
hurt
to
possibly
smooth
things
out
just
a
bit
green
flash
barleywine
pours
a
nice
copper
with
a
bubbly
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
fresh
piney
grapefruit
pnw
hops
as
advertised
some
malt
an
ester
sneak
through
but
are
mostly
hidden
by
the
hops
bitterness
hits
right
upfront
in
the
flavor
with
more
piney
cirusy
hops
the
fruity
esters
shine
more
than
the
malt
which
is
well
hidden
damn
this
is
a
hoppy
barleywine
if
you
told
me
it
was
a
dipa
i
would
believe
it
i
may
pick
this
up
again
but
i
was
not
that
impressed
and
with
this
being
my
first
beer
from
green
flash
i
might
be
a
little
skeptical
of
trying
another
drinkability
im
more
of
a
fan
of
the
english
style
of
barleywine
im
as
much
of
a
hophead
as
the
next
guy
but
it
seems
like
each
barleywine
i
have
they
are
trying
to
top
each
other
with
their
hoppiness
still
a
good
beer
that
i
would
have
again
if
offered
this
is
meant
to
be
enjoyed
in
small
quantities
and
it
does
numb
the
palate
a
bit
near
the
end
of
the
glass
it
also
seems
to
get
a
lot
dryer
as
you
proceed
in
the
drinking
session
d
this
was
a
bit
of
a
mess
and
difficult
to
finish
they
make
a
great
ipa
but
this
one
isnt
for
me
drinkability
not
a
bad
dipa
as
a
barleywine
its
definitely
coming
up
short
in
terms
of
malt
depth
sure
you
could
chalk
it
up
to
merely

overall
not

nothing
to

at

there

out
there

this

will
hold
its
own
with
most
it
packs
a
big

is
darn
drinkable
i
like
it
overall
delicious
could
be
more

who
the

wants
refined
in
an
american

deeply
drinkable
the

with
the
piney

overall
this
is
a

in
this

more
so
than
in
some
other
american
barley
wines
ive
had
but
i
dont
really
think
it
takes
away
from
a
good
level
of
drinkability
in
this
beer
nice
well

amount
of

try

really

yourself
theres

you
sometimes

very

great
representaion
of
the

this
o
a

barleywine
came
across
a
dusty
six
while
up
in
ohio
havent
seen
it
yet
in
nc
going
to
age
a
few
to
see
how
they
turn
out
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
for
a
barleywine
its
flavor
is
extremely
cloying
and
overly
buttery
sweet
for
a
beer
it
really
doesnt
taste
like
a
barleywine
or
let
alone
a
beer
at
all
i
love
bells
probably
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
but
i
just
really
dont
like
this
one

all

the
word
for
this
beer
is
suberb
superbly
crafted
and
delicious
a
home
run
all
the
way
not
as
sweet
as
many
barleywines
for
which
yay
spiritually
resembles
the
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
caramel
malt
aroma
and
flavor
with
a
distinct
hop
presence
solid
but
not
exceptional
its
a
pretty
standard
ale
o
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
very
rough
on
the
palate
beer
bitterness
alcohol
burn
not
an
easy
drinking
beer
going
to
cellar
the
rest
of
my
sixpack
to
see
how
this
mellows
out
its
definitely
a
big
beer
a
sipper
warms
up
really
nice
the
bitterness
subsides
making
it
easier
to
drink
still
good
not
as
impressed
as
i
thought
i
was
going
to
be
but
something
i
can
see
myself
having
again
with
some
age
8th
tasting
of
the
evening
everything
i
wanted
and
more
nice
balance
between
malts
and
hops
the
abv
is
strong
but
not
overpowering
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
i
intend
to
age
rest
of
6
pack
and
see
if
sweeter
flavors
emerge
glad
i
bought
ill
judge
after
aging
whether
ill
buy
again
first
off
this
is
a
beautiful
color
i
like
the
aroma
flavor
was
good
but
not
my
style
just
too
malty
i
know
this
is
how
its
supposed
to
be
i
couldnt
tie
it
to
any
particular
flavor
that
i
am
familiar
with
just
general
maltiness
nice
feel
too
it
alcohol
wasnt
very
pronounced
although
certainly
present
i
can
certainly
see
why
people
like
this
one
third
coast
leans
to
the
sweet
side
a
slap
of
alcohol
joins
the
molasses
dates
and
brown
sugar
which
tag
along
the
ride
for
much
of
the
journey
yet
not
too
sweet
and
not
too
boozy
the
beer
also
offers
nutty
flavors
and
a
modest
bittersweet
finish
which
keeps
the
beer
in
form
a
little
boozy
although
not
annoying
boozy
the
beer
is
full

i
feel

there

o
the

this
is
a
great
beer
very
nicely
balanced
between
the
hops
and
malts
and
fruitiness
and
alcohol
it
has
a
nice
fairly
fullbodied
feel
there
is
nothing
really
to
complain
about
this
beer
world
class
brew
the
closer
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
slower
i
drank
did
not
want
it
to
end
better
than
outstading
pours
a
deep
murky
brown
with
a
slight
reddish
tint
there
is
a
thin
creamcolored
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
only
the
slightest
soapy
lacing
the
aroma
is
rich
full
of
dark
fruits
and
slight
alcohol
the
taste
is
equally
delicious
as
it
smells
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
to
balance
it
all
there
is
a
modicum
of
carbonation
and
there
is
a
nice
thickness
to
the
body
o
decent
barley
wine
especially
for
the
price
ive
only
had
it
with
age
so
i
would
be
curious
to
try
it
without
gets
better
as
warms
heavy
strong
barleywine
not
my
thing
fantastic
scotch
ale
from
bells
this
is
a
very
solid
american
barleywine
o
a
delicious
beer
and
a
great
americanized
take
on
the
style
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
the
aroma
was
really
terrific
it
would
be
interesting
to
compare
an
aged
bottle
to
a
fresh
one
final
score
4
20
overall
just
a
wonderful
depth
of
flavors
rich
and
deep
in
character
thick
sweet
malts
have
a
wonderfull
toastiness
and
richness
while
the
dark
fruits
add
a
great
sweetness
to
the
beer
there
is
a
slight
hop
bitterness
present
in
its
current
state
but
by
no
means
does
it
add
too
much
bitterness
there
is
a
great
balance
to
this
beer
warming
alcohol
touch
as
well
the
only
major
differences
that
i
noticed
between
the
two
samples
were
that
the
sweet
notes
were
more
muted
in
the
aged
version
and
the
aged
version
was
a
touch
dryer
i
think
that
i
like
the
freshie
better
a
2012
vintage
smells
and
tastes
similar
to
a
good
doppelbach
i
think
the
age
must
have
shaved
off
some
rough
edges
sweet
without
being
cloying
strong
without
being
overpowering
o
this
is
an
incredible
barleywine
and
has
a
real
nice
drinkability
and
smoothness
that
can
get
someone
in
trouble
if
they
werent
careful
i
would
put
this
up
next
to
bigfoot
in
style
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
reddish
hues
to
it
very
little
bubbles
or
head
maybe
it
was
because
this
was
from
a
tap
and
not
out
of
a
bottle
but
i
was
surprised
at
how
amazingly
smooth
this
was
for
a
just
barely
10abv
barley
wine
not
quite
as
in
your
face
as
some
barley
wines
i
have
tried
but
not
in
a
bad
way
the
taste
has
prominent
notes
of
malt
fig
raisin
plum
with
a
slight
bite
on
the
finish
slightly
sweet
up
front
and
very
smooth
i
did
not
think
it
had
much
of
a
boozy
taste
to
it
but
after
finishing
16oz
i
was
definitely
feeling
it
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
if
not
slightly
lighter
barley
wine
recommend
giving
it
a
try
if
you
come
across
it
the
flavor
lingers
nicely
and
despite
the
abv
and
aroma
it
is
shockingly
easy
to
drink
i
must
say
in
closing
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
ever
tasted
this
beer
is
a
tad
rough
around
the
edges
might
be
a
candidate
for
the
cellar
betcha
it
gets
even
better
with
age
very
drinkable
notes
of
toffee
and
caramel
not
over
powering
alcohol
taste
o
this
may
be
my
new
favorite
american
barleywine
going
toetotoe
with
the
12
brooklyn
monster
bottles
that
are
floating
around
town
right
now
that
are
killin
it
softly
with
some

this

looks

ruddy

color
head
just
short
of
being
smooth
and
bubbleless
like
latte
top
didnt
seem
exceptionally
longlasting
deep
chocolate
and
oak
notes
contribute
to
the
palate
before
sipping
my
tongue
notes
beets
allspice
and
tart
cherries
spicy
tannins
and
noticeable
wood
elements
the
spice
and
oak
definitely
give
the
sweet
toffee
etc
elements
a
grounded
earthiness
could
be
cloying
on
a
hot
summer
night
especially
after
beer
has
warmed
a
bit
velvety
otherwise
with
good
carbonation
highly
rated
so
maybe
im
just
not
a
fan
of
the
style
ive
not
had
many
barleywines
that
ive
enjoyed
so
im
not
shocked
but
disappointed
nonetheless
this
is
the
first
barley
wine
that
ive
had
that
packed
this
kind
of
intense
roasted
character
though
while
im
not
a
fan
i
can
see
how
that
might
be
a
bonus
if
youre
into
it
chewy
below
average
carbonation
creamy
the
beer
pours
a
dull
dark
brown
with
copper
hues
and
a
thin
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
the
nose
is
fruit
and
caramel
grain
sweetness
forward
with
a
hint
of
metallic
bitterness
and
booze
as
it
warms
there
is
similar
sweetness
that
dominates
the
palate
while
drinking
but
also
biting
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
where
this
beer
seems
to
suffer
most
lowly
carbonated
yet
metallic
bitter
and
slightly
soapy
attributes
which
dont
not
make
for
a
pleasant
finish
its
otherwise
relatively
drinkable
for
being
a
big
beer
with
an
abv
that
creeps
beyond
10
i
admire
the
style
in
a
nonbarrel
aged
accessible
six
pack
format
but
prefer
other
examples
more
i
liked
it
a
lot
but
didnt
love
it
well
put
a
few
in
the
longterm
drawer
and
see
how
it
ages
o
a
stellar
sipper
really
mellows
as
it
warms
recommended
overall
a
nice
nightcap
of
a
beer
but
the
tannins
were
a
negative
this
is
fairly
tasty
but
not
in
the
upper
echelon
of
barleywinesold
ales
that
ive
tasted
overall
i
dont
know
if
its
because
this
particular
bottle
is
9
months
old
but
i
dont
get
any
alcohol
burn
that
others
mention
this
is
a
malt
bomb
and
dont
pick
up
hops
until
the
aftertaste
i
enjoy
the
transition
of
flavors
between
caramelbrown
sugar
dark
fruits
and
molasses
the
latter
gives
off
a
very
nice
touch
and
is
what
made
it
exceptional
in
my
opinion
i
imagine
a
bourbon
aged
version
would
be
spectacular
a
great
barleywine
a
real
sipper
and
another
solid
big
beer
offering
from
bells
aggressive
flavors
of
toasted
barley
sticky
and
sweet
with
more
hop
presence
than
i
expected
its
like
a
barleywinedopplebock
combo
if
you
like
aggressive
beers
pick
this
one
up
hmm
a
nice
play
on
old
ale
but
perhaps
a
bit
overcarbonated
and
hoppy
for
me
it
just
feels
so
much
different
from
the
style
that
i
know
but
a
good
beer
to
drink
after
all
the
toasted
brown
sugar
malts
are
nice
and
it
almost
reminds
me
of
a
super
strong
brown
ale
o
this
is
a
very
nice
and
enjoyable
barleywine
though
there
is
a
lot
more
complexity
to
the
aroma
than
there
is
in
the
flavor
this
would
probably
be
even
better
with
a
little
more
age
on
it
overall
this
beer
makes
me
realize
i
am
starting
to
drift
away
from
giant
beers
must
be
a
year
old
o
a
really
nice
barleywine
with
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
a
nice
sipper
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
one
of
my
favorite
styles
very
sweet
and
malty
with
a
bitter
finish
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
enjoys
strong
alesbarleywines
or
scotch
ales
beer
with
good
complexity
and
lower
drinkability
given
its
sweetness
and
sticky
flavors
partially
expected
from
the
style
o
this
is
a
really
nice
english
barleywine
with
just
a
bit
more
hop
presence
than
typical
examples
of
that
style
the
smokiness
is
a
nice
touch
and
prevents
the
beer
from
coming
across
as
too
syrupysweet
despite
the
toffee
burnt
sugar
and
dark
fruit
flavors
id
like
to
try
one
fresh
to
compare
as
this
2011
vintage
is
drinking
marvelously
dark
brown
ale
with
an
offwhite
head
has
a
pleasant
sweet
aroma
characteristic
of
barley
wines
taste
is
caramel
and
towards
the
end
of
the
beer
theres
a
stronger
hint
of
sweet
fig
and
syrup
theres
a
touch
of
bitterness
to
further
add
to
the
complexity
i
enjoy
this
and
i
wonder
how
it
will
be
after
aging
o
overall
a
very
nice
old
ale
lots
of
dark
fruits
and
caramel
throughout
alcohol
is
a
little
noticable
but
it
doesnt
hinder
drinking
it
would
have
it
again
o
i
can
recognize
that
this
brew
is
a
top
notch
barleywine
i
cannot
imagine
how
hot
it
would
be
fresh
but
with
2
12
years
on
it
things
have
settled
in
nicely
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
i
recognize
the
talent
exhibited
here
another
fine
brew
from
bell
o
a
delicious
old
ale
ive
only
had
a
few
of
this
style
but
they
tend
to
be
very
good
especially
when
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
id
love
a
taste
of
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
version
of
this
o
forget
about
the
10
2
you
wouldnt
ever
guess
it
third
coast
old
ale
is
very
very
enjoyable
especially
at
this
age
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
more
of
these
bottles
lying
around
o
id
be
interested
in
aging
one
of
these
inexpensive
bottles
for
a
short
period
of
time
otherwise
i
can
tell
that
tcoa
is
going
to
fall
off
with
prolonged
age
bells
has
really
achieved
something
pretty
great
here
with
a
composite
style
that
mixes
elements
of
bw
with
stouts
scotch
brown
and
old
ales
overall
good
beer
lots
of
roasted
and
burnt
notes
has
some
stout
characteristics
and
a
beautiful
dark
rich
woody
color
very
nice
brown
body
with
some
reddishness
and
nice
small
carbonation
that
makes
for
a
nice
tannish
head
very
sweet
and
alcohol
in
the
nose
somewhat
like
wheat
bread
and
some
fruity
apple
likeness
sweeter
in
the
beginning
a
little
bitter
from
the
burnt
caramelized
taste
with
some
chocolatey
undertones
some
hops
are
in
there
but
just
enough
to
offset
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
the
alcohol
also
helps
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
this
was
great
and
enjoyed
with
good
friends
good
for
a
winter
time
ale
this
ale
pours
a
rich
copper
brown
color
which
is
quite
cloudy
with
visible
sediment
in
the
glass
there
is
virtually
no
head
but
just
a
slight
amount
of
tan
lacing
the
nose
of
this
beer
is
deep
and
malty
some
hoppiness
but
it
is
definitely
overwhelmed
by
the
aroma
of
sweet
roast
malts
and
a
little
alcohol
on
the
end
the
beer
sips
chewy
and
coating
medium
bodied
with
a
lasting
bitter
mouth
coating
the
flavors
are
awesome
lots
of
malt
sweet
and
rich
there
is
a
little
hoppy
bitter
essential
and
citrus
notes
by
they
are
mostly
overwhelmed
by
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
there
is
an
alcohol
bite
but
it
is
well
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
this
is
my
first
experience
with
this
style
of
beer
but
i
definitely
look
forward
to
trying
more
excellent
offering
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
ones
that
i
cellared
overall
very
nice
barleywine
excited
to
see
how
this
one
ages
overall
a
really
good
old
ale
im
savoring
it
while
watching
a
breaking
bad
marathon
and
it
is
perfect
over
two
and
a
half
years
age
on
this
bottle
and
it
still
has
some
bite
might
want
to
leave
the
next
one
cellared
longer
o
a
unique
taste
for
me
as
ive
never
had
anything
like
it
the
unraveling
of
its
complexity
is
part
of
the
fun
here
as
it
has
a
great
range
of
taste
notes
highly
recommended
a
good
spiced
ale
nice
flavor
hides
its
strength
well
and
goes
down
easy
very
enjoyable
and
definitely
worth
trying
overall
yes
this
is
something
that
ill
age
in
my
basement
its
pretty
darn
good
but
i
wonder
how
itll
be
in
a
year
or
even
6
months
i
look
forward
to
revisiting
it
o
a
really
solid
barleywine
very
balanced
and
a
great
sipper
maybe
the
best
bw
ive
had
overall
the
beer
rocks
its
definitely
an
aperitif
sort
of
drink
sipped
slowly
and
savored
i
think
the
balance
is
spot
on
for
the
style
the
beer
is
if
not
truly
a
characteristic
example
an
outstanding
representation
i
love
it
osmooth
and
easy
drinking
enjoyable
sipping
bw
good
value
o
the
strong
tastes
mellowed
as
the
beer
warmed
with
the
fruity
notes
in
both
nose
and
taste
strengthening
for
me
a
little
less
or
better
balance
of
bitter
and
sweet
would
bump
this
up
a
notch
overall
one
of
my
favorites
not
hoppy
like
many
merican
barelywines
and
i
agree
with
calling
this
an
old
ale
i
look
forward
to
it
every
year
and
grab
at
least
2
sixes
finally
gonna
lay
one
or
two
down
this
year
and
see
what
some
age
does
to
it
overall
im
not
feeling
this
at
the
moment
i
think
ive
enjoyed
this
more
at
other
times
the
bitterness
and
sweet
malt
dont
compliment
each
other
for
my
taste
also
the
alcohol
peeks
through
a
little
too
much
mf
full
bodied
very
dry
finish
warming
4
a
very
good
english
old
ale
and
one
that
i
plan
to
come
back
to
every
fallwinter
im
drinking
this
fresh
but
my
sense
is
that
i
should
have
let
this
sit
its
delicious
but
it
seems
it
might
be
more
promising
over
time
color
is
dark
amber
and
scent
is
pretty
much
alcohol
which
im
fine
with
in
this
style
but
you
may
not
be
the
mouth
feel
has
the
kind
of
dense
oily
quality
i
love
in
barleywines
and
old
ales
i
really
like
the
taste
a
combination
of
booze
and
candy
caramel
but
my
sense
lets
wait
and
see
is
that
it
will
gain
in
complexity
over
time
a
really
good
beer
for
the
style
next
time
though
ill
set
it
aside
for
a
while
o
one
of
my
first
of
this
style
so
take
this
review
as
you
will
very
much
enjoyed
it
started
a
bit
colder
than
i
probably
shouldve
but
the
flavors
really
came
to
life
as
it
warmed
a
bit
may
be
a
bit
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
i
know
this
style
will
grow
on
me
o
wellmade
ill
get
more
of
a
recent
bottling
and
will
be
curious
to
try
it
fresher
but
follow
it
aged
with
known
storage
the
beer
is
a
nice
reddishbrown
color
the
head
is
thick
and
theres
not
a
huge
amount
of
foam
the
smell
reminded
me
of
fig
newtons
bready
and
figgy
the
initial
taste
was
figgy
and
fruity
but
i
could
feel
the
malt
come
out
the
beer
is
a
bit
thick
and
creamy
in
consistency
i
can
feel
some
alcohol
warmth
but
its
not
overwhelming
a
very
good
barleywine
pours
a
murky
bronze
with
a
moderate
beige
head
of
soapy
froth
aroma
is
interesting
a
melange
of
citrus
pine
milk
chocolate
and
caramel
sweetness
the
flavor
is
extremely
hopforward
and
unlike
any
barleywine
ive
tasted
the
palate
is
greeted
by
a
huge
blast
of
pine
resin
and
alcohol
along
with
perky
carbonation
that
accentuates
both
sweetness
is
almost
nonexistent
except
for
traces
of
milk
chocolate
and
nuts
on
the
back
end
maybe
maltier
flavors
can
be
teased
out
at
room
temperature
regardless
this
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
when
i
brought
home
a
barleywine
mouthfeel
feels
thin
for
the
style
something
more
robust
would
better
complement
the
flavor
profile
o
this
is
one
of
bells
best
and
a
great
barleywine
old
ale
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
not
overly
hopped
like
some
west
coast
ones
ive
had
and
not
too
much
alcohol
where
you
have
to
sit
on
it
to
mellow
out
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
by
bells
it
is
on
the
same
level
as
expedition
stout
im
impressed
having
just
tried
double
dba
recently
that
this
is
nearly
as
good
at
156
pack
as
opposed
to
20bomber
for
the
ddba
overall
its
a
great
barleywine
that
i
will
get
again
would
like
to
try
one
fresh
and
and
one
more
aged
reviewed
11508
i
do
think
this
is
very
good
and
i
hold
it
in
high
regard
up
to
that
last
moment
when
the
alcohol
taste
and
heat
suddenly
takes
over
albeit
a
very
small
fraction
of
the
whole
experience
it
is
enough
to
knock
the
score
down
a
notch
o
definitely
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
brew
i
enjoy
hops
but
feel
that
it
overwhelms
the
beer
during
the
aftertaste
overall
a
barley
that
is
a
bit
on
the
drier
and
more
bitter
side
with
a
big
warming
and
slow
drinking
style
this
one
is
nice
to
sit
down
with
for
a
long
haul
date
on
bottle
462013
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
very
fruity
slightly
sweet
the
alcohol
isnt
too
strong
even
though
it
was
bottled
at
the
beginning
of
april
well
balanced
i
can
see
how
aging
this
beer
could
bring
out
some
intricacies
and
allow
it
to
develop
its
complexities
its
very
good
fresh
as
well
though
as
this
is
my
first
review
i
apologize
for
the
brevity
i
hope
to
be
able
to
produce
more
detailed
descriptions
in
the
future
meh
o
although
i
have
never
had
this
beer
fresh
i
highlight
recommend
it
with
a
little
over
a
year
of
age
on
it
this
brew
is
very
balanced
with
a
sweet
slightly
boozy
mix
that
will
be
enjoyed
for
at
least
the
next
hour
of
sipping
overall
impression
although
a
little
rough
immediately
after
bottling
this
beer
improved
dramatically
after
aging
even
for
a
short
time
i
really
wish
i
would
have
had
the
patience
to
age
it
longer
it
falls
somewhere
between
a
traditional
english
old
ale
and
a
hoppy
american
barleywine
and
manages
to
remain
surprisingly
balanced
intense
booziness
is
my
biggest
criticism
but
this
beer
would
still
be
fantastic
on
a
cold
winter
day
kills
it
a
really
nice
heavy
sweet
barleywine
was
a
nice
bottle
dark
color
a
lot
of
hops
malty
but
its
hard
to
drink
this
one
without
thinking
this
would
be
great
after
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
the
sweet
notes
a
bit
much
at
this
age
one
hopes
will
become
more
complex
and
some
richer
notes
begin
to
express
themselves
as
the
hops
mellow
as
is
a
solid
barleywine
that
i
look
forward
to
breaking
out
again
in
2016
overall
perhaps
the
cleanest
most
wellbalanced
barelywine
ive
had
to
date
amazing
considering
the
lack
of
hop
presence
smooth
as
all
getup
that
this
isnt
available
in
california
is
a
damn
shame
id
love
to
get
a
few
bottles
for
aging
though
i
doubt
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
them
od
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
better
alcohol
masking
and
lower
hopping
rates
it
would
get
a
much
ranking
from
me
a
good
example
of
a
difficult
style
for
me
balanced
yet
aggressive
and
nice
to
sip
definitely
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
had
in
a
long
time
thanks
again
to
thebrewo
for
this
one
it
pours
an
enchantingly
deep
deep
copper
to
ruby
red
with
a
one
inch
off
white
head
with
excellent
retention
especially
for
the
style
which
i
find
generally
lacks
this
quality
its
got
an
interesting
nose
first
of
all
youd
never
know
it
was
over
10
abv
it
smells
more
gentle
than
that
nothing
harsh
at
all
here
there
is
some
molasses
sweetness
a
mild
but
complex
spice
profile
and
a
huge
grain
profile
that
may
even
have
some
rye
malt
in
it
the
flavor
isnt
as
sweet
as
the
nose
its
more
delicate
weird
to
call
a
beer
this
big
delicate
but
this
one
somehow
is
there
are
notes
of
vanilla
butterscotch
clove
and
a
range
of
other
attributes
that
make
me
think
this
would
be
an
ideal
holiday
beer
its
a
little
out
of
place
in
springtime
but
its
really
delicious
soft
feel
with
relaxed
carbonation
and
a
easier
drinking
medium
body
by
feel
alone
you
also
wouldnt
know
this
is
a
barleywine
the
alcohol
gets
more
prominent
as
the
beer
warms
which
is
to
be
anticipated
but
it
never
gets
tough
to
drink
or
caustic
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
like
that
its
not
super
hoppy
or
super
sweet
but
maintains
the
complexity
the
style
is
known
for
very
well
made
beer
here
101212
bottle
date
so
this
one
is
6
months
old
pours
deep
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
tannish
yellow
one
finger
head
aroma
of
caramel
malts
some
sweet
dark
fruit
and
a
bit
of
booze
thick
viscous
mouthfeel
almost
have
to
chew
this
which
i
was
not
expecting
all
malt
flavor
with
sweet
figs
and
prunes
up
front
that
meld
into
an
interesting
ever
so
slightly
bitter
finish
a
lingering
caramel
covered
fruit
left
on
the
palate
low
carbonation
a
real
winter
warmer
this
beer
is
a
bit
nicer
when
it
warms
up
its
pretty
harsh
and
hard
to
get
through
the
bottle
even
though
its
a
small
one
the
abv
is
not
much
more
than
hopslam
yet
somehow
is
way
more
present
in
this
o
pretty
good
beer
for
a
cold
evening
big
and
filling
o
this
is
a
nice
barleywine
its
not
the
most
interesting
one
in
the
world
but
its
tasty
very
drinkable
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
like
the
fact
that
it
comes
in
around
10
abv
instead
of
close
to
15
like
some
barleywines
i
think
it
makes
it
more
drinkable
and
enjoyable
nice
job
bells
a
really
good
old
ale
barleywine
at
a
great
price
an
can
really
see
this
developing
nicely
and
turning
into
a
completely
different
beer
overall
perfect
warmer
for
a
cold
night
do
yourself
a
favor
and
drink
it
over
an
hours
span
you
need
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
bells
is
starting
to
become
my
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
out
there
and
if
they
make
more
beers
of
this
caliber
they
will
slide
right
into
first
4
25
o
a
very
enjoyable
barleywine
a
standard
for
the
style
o
one
of
the
best
old
ales
that
i
have
come
across
with
a
real
smooth
quality
to
it
if
you
like
this
style
you
should
give
this
sipper
a
go
has
an
alcohol
bite
and
seems
like
a
really
good
one
for
people
who
like
to
keep
a
few
for
cellering
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
good
for
it
and
will
become
a
regular
one
that
i
will
seek
out
cheers
overall
i
didnt
really
enjoy
this
one
as
much
as
i
expect
i
would
maybe
i
could
use
some
cellaring
i
dont
know
i
feel
like
as
much
as
i
am
a
hop
head
i
might
like
the
sweeter
less
hopped
version
of
barleywines
overall
this
beer
pretty
much
represents
everything
i
expect
an
old
ale
to
be
while
it
wont
blow
you
away
its
a
great
representation
of
the
style
and
ill
keep
picking
up
a
sixer
every
year
mouth
feel
is
slightly
full
bodied
with
some
maltiness
low
to
non
existent
carbonation
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
warmth
but
no
at
all
boozy
o
a
well
crafted
barley
wine
this
is
a
definition
of
a
sipper
and
only
gets
better
as
the
brew
warms
i
will
definitely
cellar
one
and
try
this
again
overall
a
nice
big
beer
that
i
could
imagine
would
improve
with
age
very
complex
beer
nice
balance
of
extremes
sweet
hot
bitter
fruity
but
not
really
favoring
one
direction
over
the
other
browned
burgundy
with
a
cream
coloured
cap
film
of
retention
and
light
lacing
nose
of
some
dark
fruits
syrup
candy
and
caramel
light
toastiness
taste

and
a
tad
more
syrup
medium
full
body
warming
on
the
palate
full
thick
and
perfect
for
a
cold
winters
eve
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
barleywine
glad
i
got
one
of
these
and
its
perfect
on
a
night
like
this
extremely
easy
to
drink
deceivingly
so
hiding
the
alcohol
with
an
outstanding
complexity
of
flavors
the
slight
alcohol
warmth
is
almost
unnoticeable
except
as
a
means
to
balance
out
the
flavor
this
beer
may
be
at
its
peak
right
now
wish
i
had
a
large
cellar
stocked
with
it
o
very
drinkable
and
gets
better
as
it
warms
literally
cannot
find
a
fault
in
this
old
ale
im
reviewing
it
to
old
ale
style
characters
as
i
dont
think
it
resembles
an
american
barleywine
the
flavor
still
has
a
piney
bitterness
to
it
that
comes
across
upfront
its
sweet
and
chewy
with
a
lingering
bitterness
on
the
finish
i
get
some
more
toasted
coconut
caramel
pine
some
orange
marmalade
notes
on
the
palate
somewhere
i
think
theres
even
hints
of
tobacco
and
leather
as
it
warms
and
opens
simply
fantastic
brew
remained
nice
and
effervescent
even
after
a
year
really
solid
beerthis
sets
the
benchmark
even
higher
pours
a
hazy
reddishbrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
and
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
fruits
and
alcohol
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
its
quite
strong
and
boozy
in
my
opinion
poured
deep
mahogany
with
garnet
hues
in
the
light
light
beige
head
that
retained
nicely
very
big
on
the
malt
spectrum
lots
going
on
here
with
molasses
caramel
hint
of
prunes
dates
and
black
currants
hops
are
low
key
lingering
towards
the
finish
which
is
sweet
and
long
lasting
big
body
but
not
cloying
carbonation
makes
this
a
pleasure
to
quaff
a
highly
recommended
beer
o
a
good
winter
sipping
beer
from
bells
readily
available
i
bought
a
sixer
and
let
it
age
for
two
years
before
trying
it
so
i
have
no
comparison
to
fresh
final
thoughts
im
very
pleased
with
the
flavor
on
this
barleywine
another
style
done
justice
by
bells
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
i
hope
to
cellar
some
as
well
o
this
beer
is
a
good
barleywine
but
seems
that
the
taste
really
needs
some
aging
to
develop
the
same
amount
of
complexity
as
the
smell
this
has
very
quietly
become
one
of
my
goto
beers
in
michigan
smell
is
probably
the
weak
suit
i
get
a
little
booze
and
a
lot
of
maltbut
the
flavor
comes
over
you
in
waves
fruit
malt
alcohol
and
caramel
take
turns
tagging
in
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
for
the
style
nearly
devoid
of
carbonation
and
very
smooth
going
down
i
could
drink
this
over
and
over
and
id
give
up
an
ear
to
try
this
bourbon
aged
o
this
got
better
and
better
as
time
went
on
an
intense
experience
overall
a
real
good
barleywine
here
everything
ive
tried
from
this
brewery
has
been
great
would
recommend
this
in
a
second
and
wish
i
could
age
a
bottle
higher
overall
to
account
for
taste
bering
above
4
o
i
loved
this
beer
but
full
disclosure
toffee
and
fig
type
fruits
are
probably
my
favorite
combination
of
flavors
in
a
brew
flavors
here
blend
seemlessly
and
with
great
depth
great
to
have
a
high
abv
ale
that
is
ready
to
drink
now
without
being
overly
brash
or
boozy
masterfully
done
a
must
try
o
overall
this
was
a
tasty
heavy
offering
from
bells
that
would
do
very
well
with
some
age
its
strong
in
flavor
in
abv
in
mouthfeel
its
a
big
beer
in
a
small
package
probably
the
biggest
tastyest
beer
ive
had
in
a
12oz
nice
brew
just
clear
your
plans
prior
its
a
big
beer
another
fun
find
at
the
mellow
mushroom
in
greensboro
nc
it
shows
a
dark
brown
color
with
nice
swirly
lighttan
head
and
decent
lace
i
can
smell
some
alcoholgrass
and
a
tad
wheat
malt
nothing
too
impressive
but
reasonable
the
flavor
strikes
me
at
first
as
being
tart
then
i
get
piney
malt
with
grassy
whiskey
malt
dr
pepperroot
beer
and
a
little
boozy
pretty
good
its
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
crispy
feel
it
has
tiny
bubbles
a
solid
old
ale
this
is
a
good
sipping
beer
that
improves
with
warmth
allowing
a
myriad
of
subtleties
to
be
detected
overall
i
just
bought
one
bottle
of
this
but
i
want
to
get
my
hands
on
alot
more
some
for
now
and
a
6xer
or
so
to
sit
on
for
at
least
a
year
great
complexity
big
bold
flavors
but
so
well
balanced
you
will
taste
every
one
of
the
flavors
ive
described
the
transition
is
also
so
nice
starting
sweet
then
savory
then
bitter
and
drying
begging
the
next
sip
what
a
wonderful
beer
for
the
cooler
months
purchase
this
when
you
see
it
highly
recommend
overall
very
smooth
and
one
of
the
more
drinkible
barleywines
ive
had
smooth
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
really
enjoy
the
oaked
flavor
it
brings
along
with
the
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
excellent
beer
worth
a
drink
this
beer
is
a
sipper
but
it
is
totally
delicious
something
to
warm
you
up
on
a
cold
night
and
a
nice
alternative
to
sipping
a
glass
of
whiskey
or
wine
i
plan
to
age
some
of
these
and
see
how
they
turn
out
overall
very
impressed
with
this
one
i
have
had
it
fresh
a
few
times
and
loved
it
but
age
does
it
justice
as
bells
suggests
another
winner
by
bells
they
have
quite
the
winter
line
up
cant
wait
to
put
some
of
this
away
for
a
year
or
more
o
excellent
smooth
balanced
this
is
a
great
bells
offering
especially
with
some
time
under
its
belt
o
overall
a
lovely
old
ale
o
overall
a
decently
complex
beer
that
ultimately
clashes
malty
sweetness
bittering
hops
and
booziness
that
would
seem
to
benefit
from
some
aging
d2
this
has
convinced
me
that
i
need
to
come
up
with
a
good
vertical
of
this
beer
i
am
stoked
because
this
beer
is
relatively
inexpensive
and
easily
available
overall
i
must
say
this
has
held
up
quite
nicely
seeing
that
it
is
just
a
tick
over
5
years
old
there
is
a
bit
of
an
off
taste
in
the
middle
of
the
swallow
but
with
this
ones
age
i
didnt
mark
against
it
if
i
get
the
chance
to
try
a
fresh
one
and
get
the
same
taste
i
will
adjust
accordingly
a
must
try
if
you
have
not
great
stuff
unique
smooth
and
a
serious
cellar
candidate
o
this
is
a
big
flashy
must
try
for
fans
of
old
ales
it
is
a
very
flavorful
beer
with
bold
sweet
malt
and
grains
along
with
some
milder
dark
dried
fruit
and
just
a
touch
of
cherry
to
add
an
enjoyable
complexity
the
high
abv
is
well
hidden
and
the
hint
of
booze
only
does
enough
to
brighten
the
focus
on
the
malt
and
grain
this
is
a
first
class
old
ale
style
beer
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
very
best
beers
available
in
this
style
o
very
good
american
barleywine
hoppy
but
in
an
interesting
way
i
can
see
this
aging
decently
nice
beer
with
good
mouthfeel
and
good
aftertaste
thanks
again
robert
retains
a
complexity
and
potency
that
indicate
it
would
continue
to
age
well
for
quite
some
time
a
lovely
nightcap
on
a
cold
blustery
evening
aged
for
about
a
year
and
poured
into
a
snifter
visaully
it
is
nothing
stunning
slight
cloudiness
and
dark
caramel
color
smell
of
molasses
and
maybe
a
hint
of
orange
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
several
times
and
aged
for
a
year
the
beer
has
mellowed
to
the
benefit
of
the
drinker
me
lighter
in
the
mouth
than
you
would
expect
but
nice
nonetheless
still
wonderful
fresh
this
aged
bottle
had
more
pronounced
molasses
and
vanilla
notes
really
delicious
on
this
cool
autumn
night
o
a
wonderful
experience
i
can
see
myself
buying
cases
of
this
and
palo
santo
down
the
road
and
just
letting
it
sit
in
my
cellar
mmmm
tasty
caramel
with
a
slightly
burnt
edge
and
maybe
even
a
little
cocoa
mole
comes
out
a
delightful
malty
treat
that
stays
well
away
from
cloying
in
fact
it
really
is
not
all
that
sweet
there
is
still
some
hop
bitterness
and
the
alcohol
quite
drying
i
will
look
out
for
this
next
time
i
am
in
bells
distro
range
id
love
to
get
a
few
for
the
cellar
o
not
a
bad
barleywine
pretty
standard
with
some
hoppiness
to
make
it
fully
americanstyle
well
balanced
but
fairly
simple
o
pretty
decent
beer
overall
just
too
sweet
and
heavy
for
my
liking
could
be
a
good
example
of
the
style
this
is
my
first
barleywine
but
im
not
a
fan
i
may
try
again
just
because
its
a
local
brew
thats
highly
regarded
but
my
first
taste
didnt
make
me
an
immediate
fan
d
very
drinkable
really
nice
american
barleywine
with
a
really
great
malt
profile
and
enough
body
to
balance
things
out
third
coast
old
ale
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
color
with
a
very
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
nice
mellow
rich
sweet
fruit
like
aroma
the
taste
is
strong
sharp
initial
bite
with
sweet
wine
like
flavors
and
then
finishes
dry
with
a
strong
oak
like
flavor
good
complex
and
strong
flavor
overall
this
barleywine
doesnt
disappoint
good
full
flavor
enjoyable
o
barleywines
usually
arent
my
favorite
style
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
had
a
nice
balance
between
the
bready
malts
and
caramelslight
fruity
flavors
alcohol
very
well
hidden
for
a
10
2
barely
wine
also
not
syrupy
the
problem
i
have
with
most
barleywines
is
that
they
are
too
syrupy
and
too
boozey
this
definitely
doesnt
encounter
either
of
those
problems
definitely
recommend
trying
it
overall
the
right
amount
of
booziness
for
the
style
complex
but
many
of
these
in
the
genre
are
not
too
bad
oone
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
had
didnt
have
the
heat
i
pick
up
in
some
nice
all
around
overall
above
average
simple
well
constructed
barleywine
despite
its
label
o
good
and
very
interesting
worthwhile
will
try
again
recommended
overall
first
of
all
i
gotta
say
i
dislike
most
american
barleywines
english
barleywines
are
hands
down
what
i
prefer
when
i
drink
a
barleywine
but
this
american
style
barleywine
is
crazy
good
with
alot
of
age
on
it
its
drinking
phenominally
right
now
but
it
could
still
be
cellared
for
longer
with
the
carbonation
holding
solid
put
a
6
pack
away
for
5
years
and
you
will
be
amazed
by
this
beer
i
gotta
try
it
fresh
for
comparision
since
i
have
not
tried
this
beer
fresh
yet
with
this
beer
and
expedition
stout
i
am
beginging
to
think
that
bells
makes
some
serious
cellar
beers
i
am
going
to
personally
look
into
this
further
this
was
very
very
easy
to
drink
despite
the
alcohol
and
it
was
perfect
at
about
55
degrees
would
get
again
north
coast
is
a
great
sipper
it
is
a
premium
beer
from
a
premium
brandbrewery
overall
a
solid
barleywine
but
not
as
great
as
my
favorite
barleywine

this

the

overall
4
55
a
hard
to
pin
down
beer
in
case
i
didnt
say
that
enough
thats
a
real
winner
but
that
leaves
you
wondering
what
exactly
it
is
o
nice
barleywine
wish
i
had
a
few
more
to
put
away
and
see
how
it
develops
coulda
had
a
bit
more
carbonation
but
i
really
enjoyed
how
sticky
it
is
o
3
5
o
this
is
a
good
beer
in
that
although
it
doesnt
do
it
all
huge
complexity
and
so
on
it
does
very
well
the
appearance
is
spot
on
smell
is
the
most
lacking
category
taste
is
simple
at
least
as
barley
wines
go
but
smooth
and
mouth
feel
is
also
spot
on
the
alcohol
in
this
one
ensures
its
a
sipper
at
first
its
a
little
boozy
but
it
mellows
out
as
the
beer
warms
the
nose
is
more
intense
than
the
flavor
if
the
flavor
was
as
malty
bready
and
complex
as
the
nose
this
would
be
flawless
this
is
a
solid
barleywine
as
it
stands
but
i
think
a
few
more
months
stashed
away
will
calm
the
booze
and
mellow
the
flavors
i
did
enjoy
it
overall
overall
quite
a
nice
beer
and
a
very
solid
barleywine
i
am
sure
it
would
be
nice
with
some
age
on
it
as
well
pours
a
deep
mirky
brown
with
some
amber
highlights
around
the
edges
a
solid
tan

of
the
beer
the
whole
glass
down
with
tons
of
lacing
the
aroma
leads
off
with
lots
of
sweet
caramel
notes
the
taste
becomes
much
more
complex
adding
onto
the
sweet
caramel
with
hints
of
fig
plum
sweet
chocolate
and
molasses
the
mouthfeel
is
perfectfully
full
and
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slight
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
spectacular
american
barleywine
at
just
over
two
years
old
ive
had
it
fresh
as
well
and
it
definitely
gained
a
ton
of
complexity
over
that
time
well
worth
the
wait
o
like
the
label
says
im
gonna
commit
a
few
of
these
to
the
cellar
because
its
just
too
intense
right
off
the
line
a
malt
bomb
that
needs
some
time
to
mature
nice
old
ale
one
you
can
definitely
enjoy
fresh
o
this
a
very
good
cold

nice

like
this
beer
good
depth

still
maintaining

done

dark
fruits
caramel
cherries

and
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
earthy
hop
flavor
medium
to
dry
finish
in
an
otherwise
full
body
light
level
of
carbonation
with
a
sweet
almost
sticky
mouthfeel
this
is
a
really
nice
barleywine
i
wish
i
had
picked
up
more
than
one
because
i
think
a
bit
of
age
would
have
only
made
this
better
o
id
like
to
revisit
this
brew
with
a
bit
of
age
on
it
its
good
but
i
beat
it
is
much
better
after
a
year
or
two
a
nice
brew
for
cold
winters
day
o
a
really
good
beer
and
im
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
a
barley
wine
pretty
impressed
o
not
bad
not
great
by
any
means
that
earthy
bitterness
is
a
little
too
harsh
at
times
would
like
to
try
this
with
some
age
on
it
o
overall
i
like
this
drank
it
too
early
i
know
but
i
put
some
back
for
aging
o
interesting
at
first
this
barleywine
comes
off
quite
hoppy
for
the
style
but
after
the
first
few
sips
the
maltiness
and
sweetness
really
coat
the
palate
and
the
hops
fall
to
the
back
i
didnt
really
like
it
at
first
but
after
the
first
few
sips
i
really
started
to
appreciate
the
complexity
displayed
in
this
beer
i
may
buy
a
few
bottles
to
age
and
would
not
turn
this
down
if
offered
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
solid
take
on
the
old
ale
style
that
is
not
as
sweet
as
some
others
i
have
had
for
10
abv
it
is
fairly
well
integrated
and
overall
has
a
pleasant
arrangement
of
flavors
worth
giving
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance
o
a
good
beer
overall
but
i
think
it
might
be
in
the
awkward
stage
this
could
be
great
when
the
flavors
meld
a
bit
more
and
mellow
out
fortunately
ive
got
another
bottle
to
hold
on
to
for
another
year
or
two
it
might
also
be
a
bit
better
as
a
young
brash
beer
with
somewhat
bolder
flavors
as
it
is
the
sum
of
this
beer
is
somehow
just
a
little
less
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
still
good
though
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
with
a
bit
more
age
overall
a
fantastic
barley
wine
i
am
going
to
cellar
and
try
at
5
years
and
10
years
to
see
how
it
ages
o
a
very
sweet
although
expertly
balance
barleywine
very
fruity
overall
this
is
a
very
different
barleywine
that
ive
been
use
to
but
i
really
enjoy
it
ring
those
bells
baby
ring
them
bells
overall
a
really
good
beer
i
would
like
to
drink
some
with
some
age
on
it
this
might
be
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
im
guessing
that
the
age
really
helped
it
it
was
incredibly
smooth
and
it
didnt
taste
anywhere
near
the
10
alcohol
mark
i
wish
i
had
more
4
4
4
4
5
3
and
that
is
what
this
barleywine
really
needs
overall
this
almost
5
year
old
beer
has
held
up
awesome
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
ever
had
love
the
play
of
oxidation
on
this
one
if
the
body
were
lighter
the
wet
paper
flavors
would
have
nothing
to
bounce
off
of
beautiful
overall
pretty
good
beer
i
dont
think
i
have
every
tried
this
style
before
and
i
am
not
sure
what
i
think
it
was
initially
too
sweet
for
my
liking
the
abv
is
also
a
little
too
strong
for
me
taste
i
would
like
to
try
other
varieties
of
this
style
o
another
solid
offering
from
bells
incredibly
drinkable
given
the
abv
drinks
great
fresh
cant
wait
to
age
a
few
of
these
and
see
how
they
mature
o
great
barleywine
heavyhitting
flavour
that
lasts
overall
a
well
crafted
barleywine
i
am
glad
i
bought
a
whole
case
i
recommend
o
drinkable
for
a
bottle
at
least
this
is
an
awesome
beer
it
lacks
some
flavorssmells
that
i
like
in
a
barleywine
but
its
interesting
with
the
apple
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
it
tastes
more
english
than
american
and
the
hoppiness
is
balanced
with
the
malt
very
well
i
really
wish
i
had
several
bottles
of
this
to
sample
annually
overall
a
very
tasty
old
ale
that
is
surprisingly
very
smooth
considering
how
fresh
this
is
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
can
be
gained
by
aging
a
few
bottles
o
a
decent
barleywine
or
old
ale
nothing
special
now
but
seems
like
with
some
age
it
could
have
potential
luckily
ive
got
a
bottle
in
the
cellar
with
a
year
or
two
on
it
already
o
pretty
tasty
drinkable
for
the
abv
solid
o
not
bad
but
nothing
special
o
such
a
mellow
this
does
have
a
year
on
it
old
ale
bready
and
malty
and
pretty
darn
delicious
o
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
there
are
better
choices
in
the
style
but
this
is
still
a
solid
stronger
beer
o
not
sure
if
i
would
call
this
a
barleywine
especially
not
an
american
barleywine
does
not
have
that
hop
presence
like
most
barleywines
do
but
it
is
a
good
old
ale
with
lots
of
sweet
malts
wonder
if
aging
helped
or
hurt
this
barleywine
everything
here
is
done
well
the
body
feel
and
drinkability
of
this
beer
are
spot
on
however
the
flavor
leaves
something
to
be
desired
the
hop
intensity
seems
dim
for
how
fresh
i
am
sampling
it
its
a
solid
beer
but
for
me
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
with
bells
logo
i
wonder
what
they
could
have
made
it
perhaps
ill
find
out
when
i
break
one
out
a
year
or
so
from
now
overall
a
very
pleasant
drink
that
i
really
enjoyed
i
would
have
again
for
sure
a
great
beer
for
sipping
and
enjoying
o
its
ok
but
just
pretty
average
i
think
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
great
taste
and
great
mouthfeel
the
only
thing
lacking
is
the
smell
wish
the
smell
was
more
apparent
o
one
of
the
more
easy
drinking
barleywines
ive
ever
had
very
drinkable
and
creates
an
experience
for
the
drinker
well
brewed
now
go
out
there
and
do
something
about
the
lack
of
aroma
bells
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
perfect
brew
for
a
cold
fall
day
and
i
loved
the
complexity
of
the
smell
and
taste
id
love
to
try
a
fresh
one
for
comparison
but
this
one
is
a
winner
in
a
style
that
i
love
0
third
coast
is
a
powerful
barley
wine
that
packs
a
punch
it
will
warm
you
up
in
the
winter
i
need
to
find
more
somehow
in
upstate
ny
overall
i
am
surprised
i
have
not
heard
more
about
this
barleywine
i
will
defiantly
be
buying
more
o
really
solid
barleywine
im
a
bit
sorry
i
didnt
cellar
this
one
awhile
will
need
another
to
lay
down
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
when
considering
the
amount
of
alcohol
present
again
this
is
my
first
barley
wine
so
i
can
not
compare
it
to
anything
else
in
the
old
ale
or
barley
wine
class
i
love
the
style
and
will
be
back
for
more
overall
definitely
an
aclass
cellerable
brew
delicious
maltiness
and
fruity
esters
the
bitterness
is
definitely
there
but
the
brewer
did
not
go
overboard
for
the
sake
of
saying
this
is
an
american
barleywine
my
best
analogy
for
this
one
is
from
music
where
the
sweetness
handles
trebel
and
bitterness
is
the
bass
the
flavors
work
together
extremely
well
highly
recommended
dangerously
drinkable
strong
ale
that
goes
down
like
a
session
beer
bravo
bells
overall
this
is
a
straight
middling
american
barleywine
in
my
opinion
nothing
really
pops
out
and
screams

was
from
batch

it
was
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
very
murky
raisin
in
color
and
didnt
let
much
light
pass
through
it
it
smelled
of
sweet
malt
and
candied
fruit
it
didnt
feature
any
type
of
hops
at
all
it
was
kind
of
candied
sugar
and
molasses
like
in
terms
of
the
nose
im
sure
it
mellows
out
with
time
it
drinks
kind
of
sweet
and
has
the
candied
fruit
thing
going
again
the
alcohol
was
definitely
present
as
i
tried
to
pick
through
the
flavors
it
dranks
well
for
both
the
style
and
content
i
think
i
need
to
try
this
with
some
age
on
it
it
was
pretty
good
but
still
pretty
fresh
for
a
barleywine
so
that
may
have
affected
what
i
thought
it
would
have
been
more
drinkable

the

werent

was

of
the
same
beer
pours
a
muddy
amber
color
this
is
lightly
carbonated
and
has
a
wispy
amberbrown
head
there
are
thick
juicy
aromas
of
aged
malts
figs
raisins
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
at
the
end
this
has
a
medium
body
up
front
which
leads
to
a
fuller
mouthfeel
in
the
finish
it
almost
coats
my
mouth
there
are
lots
of
dried
fruit
notes
here
fig
and
raisin
predominantly
but
a
huge
malty
contribution
is
here
as
well
the
malt
goes
from
a
sweet
caramel
note
up
front
right
through
to
a
dry
toasted
malt
finish
the
hops
in
this
are
somewhat
restrained
but
there
is
a
definite
contribution
in
the
flavor
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
dry
maltiness
in
the
finish
is
quite
intriguing
it
is
what
really
jumps
out
for
me
right
now
this
beer
is
a
malt
lovers
dream
update

i
originally
had
the
2003
in
2004
and
so
had
an
opportunity
to
taste
a
rightlyaged
2005
in
the
spring
of
2006
thanks
to
the
generosity
of
beerguy
this
sample
had
a
little
bit
more
alcohol
sting
in
the
mouth
which
i
love
with
the
style
other
than
that
it
was
right
on
so
im
raising
the
mouthfeel
to
a
perfect
5
0
and
calling
this
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
drinkability
very
good
as
was
aforementioned
i
wish
i
had
more
of
these
for
the
cellar
as
the
label
advocates
in
any
case
this
is
a
very
special
beer
i
lowered
the
drinkability
score
because
of
this
beers
sweetness
and
high
alcohol
content
my
friend
alec
gave
this
beer
the
antischafer
award
its
the
beer
you
drink
when
youre
drinking
one
beer
tasty
offering
good
winter
beer
for
me
ill
have
to
remember
this
one
in
the
future
had
a
3year
old
aged
bottle
about
7
5
years
later
and
its
very
mellow
and
nice
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
murky
brown
color
with
minimal
head
and
little
lace
present
an
aroma
of
malt
hopcs
caramel
and
dark
fruit
the
flavor
consisted
of
malt
hops
caramel
and
unknown
dark
fruit
it
had
a
medium
body
and
an
overall
very
sugary
sweet
aspect
to
it
maybe
due
to
time
in
the
tapkeg
it
had
a
bittersweet
finish
to
it
beer
is
good
happy
strong
beering
poured
a
rich
reddish
brown
with
an
amazing
amount
of
sediment
playing
around
in
there
light
head
reduced
down
fairly
quick
in
my
pilsner
went
to
mostly
a
light
cream
colored
ring
just
the
right
amount
of
carbination
scent
and
taste
of
dark
cherries
nice
dark
flavorings
good
and
toasty
tasting
dark
cherry
some
fruit
caramel
and
coffee
what
lingers
is
a
bit
of
cherry
and
burnt
toast
and
a
teensy
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
background
the
more
i
sip
i
think
im
tasting
a
bit
of
woodiness
great
and
thick
full
bodied
but
not
too
heavy
good
full
mouthfeel
a
bit
chewy
very
nice
tastes
drinkability
is
very
high
for
a
high
abv
beer
not
outstanding
but
very
good
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
one
centimeter
thick
offwhite
head
lots
of
sediment
is
suspended
in
the
beer
and
is
lofted
upward
by
the
rising
carbonation
bubbles
very
nice
sweet
fruity
cherries
plums
aroma
with
hints
of
the
high
alcohol
mixed
in
hints
of
a
bit
of
a
burbon
like
smell
syrupy
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
a
great
tasting
fullbodied
beer
sweet
malt
comes
through
first
and
then
the
hops
join
in
with
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
fruity
flavors
then
and
linger
nicely
in
the
mouth
taste
only
improves
and
becomes
more
complex
as
it
warms
this
is
certainly
one
of
one
of
my
favorites
this
is
an
excellent
strong
old
ale
but
not
in
the
english
style
at
least
not
at
this
young
age
this
bells
reminds
me
more
of
a
dogfish
head
90
minute
ipa
or
bells
two
hearted
ale
i
would
guess
that
with
a
year
or
three
of
aging
this
will
be
an
exceptional
strong
old
ale
in
the
english
style
at
this
stage
the
hops
are
still
strongly
assertive
which
is
not
meant
to
detract
from
this
wonderful
ale
get
a
case
of
this
and
cellar
it
for
awhile
you
will
be
glad
you
did
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
with
a
creamysticky
headaromas
of
dried
fruit
and
of
brown
sugar
a
nice
robust
aroma
wow
what
a
nice
rich
complex
beer
flavors
of
fruit
and
dough
with
some
big
alcohol
notes
as
this
beer
warms
a
big
hearty
beer
meant
to
be
drank
to
warm
you
upbig
and
chewey
just
awesomethanks
aksmokedporter
for
this
great
brew
from
the
home
state
hitting
the
bottom
of
the
glass
makes
me
want
to
get
another
one
one
of
bells
finer
nonstout
offerings
not
to
be
confused
with
the
lackluster
third
coast
beer
intense
beer
and
one
that
id
love
to
sample
again
many
thanks
to
feloniousmonk
for
this
flavor
explosion
thank
again
to
feloniousmonk
this
is
one
big
ass
beer
and
i
expect
nothing
less
from
bells
a
great
wintertime
sipper
that
is
packed
to
the
gills
with
flavor
a
must
try
for
any
barleywine
lover
pours
a
murky
brownish
color
with
a
short
tan
head
that
quickly
fades
into
a
thin
lace
composed
of
large
bubbles
nose
is
sweet
dark
fruit
blended
with
some
earthy
tobacco
and
spicy
alcohol
fairly
fullbodied
with
little
carbonation
creating
a
bit
of
a
chewy
texture
taste
begins
with
dark
raisins
black
cherries
and
figs
followed
by
some
leathery
notes
and
a
bit
of
wood
some
winey
notes
are
present
towards
the
end
along
with
a
bite
of
raw
alcohol
in
the
finish
an
enjoyable
brew
that
is
meant
to
be
sipped
slowly
thanks
to
marc77
for
the
sample
overall
this
is
a
good
old
ale
tastey
with
lots
of
character
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
i
think
the
taste
is
really
disapointing
definately
bitter
not
very
clear
what
kind
of
hop
taste
is
there
though
no
fruitiness
at
all
just
kind
of
an
astringency
actually
that
isnt
very
pleasant
maybe
its
just
the
overwhelming
hops
should
let
this
one
age
i
think
to
get
the
most
out
of
it
third
coast
is
borderline
between
an
old
ale
and
a
barley
wine
for
me
but
why
sweat
the
small
details
this
is
tasty
regardless
of
what
style
you
classify
it
as
and
shows
that
bells
is
fully
capable
of
doing
more
than
just
the
stouts
that
it
is
best
known
for
many
thanks
to
trbeer
for
introducing
me
to
fine
michigan
brews
appearance
pours
a
beautiful
chestnut
appearance
just
awesome
seems
bells
lives
by
their
slogan
if
beer
was
meant
to
be
filtered
we
wouldnt
have
kidneys
on
this
one
cream
colored
foam
forms
nice
and
thick
billows
out
of
my
tulip
shaped
chalice
leaves
collar
of
lacing
and
continually
with
each
sip
completely
coats
the
glass
aroma
pine
cone
scented
touch
of
hops
rich
in
alcohol
and
fruit
combo
hints
of
chocolate
and
bready
yeast
make
for
a
complex
session
for
the
senses
taste
i
am
guessing
the
hops
were
even
more
influential
in
the
overall
flavor
profile
early
one
in
its
conception
however
now
the
mellow
balanced
blend
and
pure
drinkability
is
insane
this
beer
is
beefy
a
nice
smooth
piney
bitterness
and
sweet
loads
of
malt
are
magnificant
mouthfeel
succulent
beer
like
a
prime
rib
full
bodied
and
full
flavored
smooth
mellow
carbonatiobn
nice
drinkability
for
nine
percent
alcohol
by
volume
and
this
much
flavor
here
i
cant
believe
how
incredibly
drinkable
this
beer
is
thanks
to
aaronh
for
bringing
it
into
my
grasps
wow
deep
garnet
color
topped
by
a
yellowcream
head
the
head
slowly
fades
to
a
thin
collar
of
foam
wonderful
sweet
malt
aromas
coupled
with
a
fair
amount
of
hop
spiciness
fruits
and
a
touch
of
peat
as
well
the
taste
is
amazingly
smooth
the
strong
complex
aroma
and
higher
abv
had
me
prepared
to
be
slapped
but
instead
i
get
a
subtly
complex
beer
the
alcohol
is
there
and
theres
a
slight
bit
of
piney
fusels
but
there
also
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
hopinspired
pine
as
well
a
slight
caramel
sweetness
precedes
this
melange
of
pine
resins
hints
of
roasted
grain
and
chocolate
appear
in
the
aftertaste
and
then
gradually
fade
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
keep
it
from
becoming
syrupy
drinkability
is
much
too
good
for
a
beer
with
this
amount
of
alcohol
the
light
flavors
great
aroma
and
perfect
body
could
make
a
drunkard
out
of
you
when
combined
with
the
drinkability
and
well
crafted
strength
i
have
had
this
beer
in
my
posession
for
8
months
what
a
treat
pours
chestnut
with
a
thin
head
that
leaves
behind
quite
a
bit
of
lace
aroma
is
caramel
and
molasses
with
some
dried
fig
flavor
is
strong
and
complex
with
caramel
molasses
rum
and
a
fair
amount
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
body
is
medium
full
with
medium
carbonation
it
would
be
excellent
if
the
finish
were
slightly
smoother
the
alcohol
is
quite
noticeable
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
good
winter
warmer
and
would
be
a
great
beer
to
age
this
is
another
great
bells
beer
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
this
along
with
maudite
were
my
first
big
abv
beers
and
i
first
tried
them
a
few
years
ago
at
ashleys
in
ann
arbor
time
to
revisit
this
special
beer
murky
rusty
body
with
a
small
light
tan
head
smells
of
smoked
beef
caramel
malts
some
sweetness
and
a
little
alcohol
taste
is
rich
and
meaty
yet
sweet
a
little
smokiness
big
hops
follow
and
lead
to
a
bitter
finish
sweet
toffee
lingers
warming
and
delicious
big
mouthfeel
and
surprisingly
drinkable
for
its
strength
cheers
definitely
another
solid
offering
from
bells
a
nice
warming
old
ale
that
has
the
alcohol
to
warm
but
doesnt
show
it
quite
good
and
one
that
ill
absolutely
have
again
when
warm
its
a
high
gravity
hoppier
bitterer
old
ale
actually
quite
similar
to
double
bastard
this
has
little
sweetness
though
and
i
recommend
having
it
with
a
piece
of
cheesecake
if
youre
into
the
whole
beer
with
food
thing
you
aint
drinking
more
than
a
bottle
of
this
though
its
a
commanding
beverage
it
has
very
little
aroma
nothing
bad
is
noticeable
but
by
smell
it
doesnt
give
up
its
mystery
the
taste
is
beguiling
the
flavors
blend
in
and
out
of
hoppiness
and
maltiness
it
is
definitely
a
midwestern
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
substantial
but
not
cloying
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
prepare
to
become
wobbly
drinkability
way
too
rich
to
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
but
if
you
want
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
seek
this
one
out
the
third
coast
old
ale
poured
into
the
glass
a
very
deep
copperdark
amber
color
with
minimal
head
and
modest
carbonation
aroma
is
fairly
hoppy
but
very
malty
as
wel
with
hints
of
spice
and
alcohol
coming
thrugh
taste
is
of
malt
and
burnt
sugar
at
first
then
is
quickly
filled
in
with
a
piney
hop
bitterness
and
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
not
too
heavy
in
the
body
and
goes
down
fairly
smooth
except
for
some
delicious
residual
hop
bitterness
probably
worth
cellaring
a
little
while
third
coast
old
ale
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
the
appearance
and
aroma
were
superb
but
the
raw
medicinal
taste
was
a
real
detractor
perhaps
this
beer
really
is
better
after
spending
some
time
in
the
cellar
thats
where
number
two
is
headed
for
few
months
or
longer
ng
ive
just
tried
a
super
fresh
sample
of
this
beer
and
it
rocks
ive
adjusted
my
ratings
accordingly
again
huge
ass
caramel
malt
load
obtrusive
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
they
say
to
cellar
this
and
i
will
but
this
is
damn
good
in
its
rawest
and
purest
form
f
consistently
thick
malty
white
head
awesome
lacing
the
beer
is
a
cloudy
rusty
reddish
liquid
robust
aroma
and
taste
clean
finish
but
leaves
a
fantastic
aftertaste
the
high
alcohol
content
is
not
apparent
i
could
use
a
few
sixpacks
of
this
stuff
this
is
a
hearty
olde
ale
i
have
drank
cellared
versions
of
this
brew
and
aged
bottles
are
better
however
the
young
batches
just
dont
have
any
balance
and
are
harsh
and
medicinal
if
you
like
westcoast
offerings
along
the
lines
of
stone
you
will
enjoy
this
one
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
otherwise
exceptional
bells
lineup
but
still
a
kickass
brew

thanks
to
bighuge
for
supplying
this
one
much
appreciated
medium
amber
color
medium

malty
aroma
wow
zip
zang
zowie
this
is
a
big
bold
fullbodied
barleywine
malty
and
hoppy
malts
are
caramel
and
toffee
hops
are
spicy
well
balanced
taste
is
full
and
nearly
chewy
very
nice
beer
there
is
no
alcohol
bite
despite
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
dry
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
with
a
slightly
alcohol
bite
this
one
poured
a
amberbrown
color
with
a
very
small
head
not
much
carbonation
going
on
either
the
aroma
was
exceptional
because
it
seemed
to
change
every
time
i
smelled
it
the
taste
was
also
quite
complex
lots
of
different
sweet
malts
in
the
flavor
which
mixed
well
with
the
spicy
alcohol
which
was
very
apparent
at
the
finish
flavors
didnt
mix
quite
as
well
on
the
tongue
as
they
did
on
the
nose
but
that
was
its
only
downfall
another
success
from
my
favorite
instate
brewery
this
brew
pours
a
dark
brownishorange
color
with
a
very
thin
light
beige
head
the
aroma
is
strong
malt
with
a
little
raisin
and
caramel
the
body
is
very
robust
with
flavors
of
malt
peppery
alcohol
berries
and
brown
sugar
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
the
flavor
but
it
all
meshes
well
the
finish
is
a
little
tart
for
my
taste
but
i
imagine
an
older
bottle
would
be
more
mellow
i
will
definitely
try
this
again
the
taste
is
dominated
by
caramel
but
dont
expect
this
beer
to
be
very
sweet
it
has
a
sweet
character
but
there
is
also
some
bitterness
in
the
taste
that
makes
this
beer
special
the
alcohol
of
this
beer
limits
the
number
of
bottles
you
can
have
in
one
night
i
must
admitt
though
that
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
very
smooth
and
creamy
very
nice
brew
another
big
success
from
kalamazoo
the
flavors
are
malty
w
hoppy
along
the
way
this
is
a
true
winter
beer
a
real
belly
warmer
pours
a
murky
walnut
brown
with
some
spooky
looking
brown
chunks
floating
about
aroma
is
well
spearmint
gum
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
but
it
has
some
sort
of
gum
aspect
the
alcohol
is
already
announcing
itself
do
i
press
on
flavor
is
sharply
bittersweet
with
some
odd
aromatics
alcohol
is
a
bit
harsh
and
high
octane
an
old
ale
that
seems
to
march
to
the
beat
of
a
different
drummer
a
good
beer
but
low
on
the
drinkability
scale
simply
because
it
becomes
a
bit
overwhelming
at
the
end
i
would
and
i
will

offwhite
head
drops
slowly
to
a
thin
surface
covering
that
holds
throughout
the
glass
a
simple
swirl
of
the
glass
will
bring
it
back
up
in
size
yet
it
leaves
little
lacing
about
the
glass
probably
due
to
the
high
level
of
alcohol
present
a
rich
caramel
malt
resides
in
the
nose
accentuated
by
spicy
floral
citrusy
and
herbal
hops
as
well
as
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
some
mild
fruitiness
the
body
is
full
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
a
very
fine
natural
carbonation
that
gently
caresses
the
tongue
all
of
the
elements
found
in
the
nose
are
carried
over
into
the
flavor
plus
more
it
starts
with
a
gently
sweet
and
lightly
fruity
caramel
malt
that
expresses
a
gentle
nuttiness
and
an
occassional
mild
note
of
vanilla
more
fruit
dates
raisins
and
a
light
touch
of
citrusy
and
piney
hops
becomes
apparent
across
the
middle
along
with
a
solid
bitterness
it
finishes
with
some
lingering
malt
and
a
burst
of
citrusypiney
hops
amongst
a
rising
bitterness
quite
nice
seemingly
more
of
a
barleywine
than
an
old
ale
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
well
worth
trying
and
a
good
addition
to
anyones
cellar
looks
like
apple
cider
deep
amber
and
murky
with
sudsy
head
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
this
seems
to
be
a
classic
barley
wine
in
my
opinion
though
not
my
favorite
style
or
even
one
of
my
favorites
this
is
a
well
done
brew
very
crisp
and
effervescent
and
very
sweet
like
brandy
alcohol
seems
to
be
buried
which
is
also
good
this
wasnt
all
that
murky
like
other
reviewers
have
observed
its
a
darker
shade
of
slightly
cloudy
brown
the
head
is
small
but
thick
what
a
wonderful
aroma
here
its
so
simple
but
so
kick
ass
sweet
maltiness
all
the
way
as
goes
the
flavor
sweet
maltiness
that
is
thick
and
chewy
the
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
i
dont
notice
it
until
a
warm
finish
this
should
be
a
sipper
but
its
hard
to
just
sip
it
i
just
love
the
sweet
molasses
maltiness
in
this
beer
thanks
to
cretemixer
for
the
bottle
i
didnt
know
what
to
make
of
this
noticable
flavour
spicy
hops
caramel
some
nectary
kinda
peachy
notes
quite
bitter
i
think
these
flavours
could
have
worked
well
in
moderation
and
it
could
have
done
without
the
raw
alcohol
that
pops
out
right
at
the
end
if
anything
it
lacked
balance
and
texture
definitely
not
boring
lots
of
flavour
another
gift
from
feloniousmonk
tasted
of
sweet
malts
bitter
hops
and
biscuits
very
thick
and
almost
chewy
mediumhigh
body
with
minimal
carbonation
good
unique
but
good
i
will
definately
revisit
thank
you
feloniousmonk
for
this
sample
ive
been
fortunate
to
have
tried
the
best
two
barley
wines
ive
ever
had
this
past
week
first
it
was
north
coast
old
ale
now
this
thanks
monk
you
truly
are
the
man
just
about
a
perfect
balance
of
hops
and
malt
some
fruity
notes
sneak
through
the
bitterness
warming
and
potent
but
goes
down
suprisingly
easy
i
was
feeling
a
little
under
the
weather
tonight
and
this
was
good
medicine
i
hope
i
can
get
more
revisited
nov
8th
from
same
batch
now
24
months
aged
mellowed
out
some
with
more
burntness
coming
through
otherwise
its
still
awesome
as
ever
id
still
strap
it
to
my
face
just
love
the
smell
oh
yea
thanks
to
feloniousmonk
for
this
bottle
my
goodness
this
be
exceptional
ale
strong
flavor
is
almost
overwhelming
to
the
palate
the
nose
is
so
heavily
malted
as
to
make
the
strong
flavor
seem
slightly
weak
by
comparison
it
is
as
if
the
beer
is
giving
off
the
aroma
of
baking
bread
you
can
almost
sense
heat
the
thick
rich
feel
is
creamy
and
smooth
to
the
hilt
the
high
alcohol
level
is
masked
by
the
very
strong
flavor
but
you
can
catch
it
in
the
back
of
the
throat
if
you
rush
a
gulp
the
malty
taste
is
buttery
bready
and
ends
in
a
bitter
finish
there
is
also
caramel
and
toffee
mixed
in
there
to
make
things
interesting
the
murky
bronze
brew
is
topped
by
one
finger
of
tan
froth
that
gives
way
to
a
light
film
there
is
minimal
lace
but
this
seems
trivial
in
light
of
the
tasty
goodness
this
beer
poured
a
dark
orangebrown
color
with
a
medium
tan
head
the
aroma
reminds
me
a
lot
of
grapefruit
for
some
reason
the
taste
was
very
good
i
usually
do
not
enjoy
bells
beers
but
i
have
to
give
this
one
a
thumbs
up
the
9
0
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
and
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
i
will
have
this
one
again
thanks
fm
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
liked
this
one
good
beer
i
dig
this
one
definitely
one
of
bells
better
offerings
in
a
lot
of
ways
its
like
twohearteds
big
brother
light
amber
color
little
head
big
hoppy
flavor
but
compared
to
some
others
is
very
drinkable
definitely
some
fruit
in
there
too
powerfully
bitter
for
that
citrus
grapefruit
flavor
you
get
from
ipas
but
more
of
an
old
fruit
taste
that
gets
cleansed
by
the
huge
bitter
backend
that
just
rolls
over
the
tongue
as
you
swallow
this
guy
quite
drinkable
as
far
as
barleywinesold
alesbeers
of
that
ilk
go
man
what
a
beer
pours
out
to
a
cross
between
a
cloudy
apple
cider
and
what
could
pass
for
liquid
caramel
very
slight
light
brown
head
taste
is
very
complex
fruitlike
taste
with
plums
and
raisins
present
and
caramel
as
well
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
barleywines
as
their
drinkability
is
tough
due
to
being
such
big
beers
but
this
one
is
an
exception
you
could
have
several
if
you
wanted
to
this
is
a
unique
offering
from
the
rest
of
the
bells
line
the
yeast
profile
is
different
delicious
taste
it
is
a
wonderful
taste
the
sweet
caramel
comes
front
with
the
hint
of
fruit
and
finished
with
a
slight
touch
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
a
fullbodied
beer
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
warms
the
beer
gut
when
it
hits
another
fine
brew
from
kalamanzoo
this
is
such
a
great
barley
wine
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
bubbly
head
that
doesnt
seem
to
linger
around
for
too
long
minimal
lace
is
left
on
the
glass
aromas
are
of
sweet
caramel
hops
raisins
and
hints
of
chocolate
taste
seems
to
be
quite
similar
to
the
smell
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
syrupy
leaving
a
thin
film
on
my
tongue
which
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
i
could
drink
this
exceptional
beer
any
day
of
the
week
thanks
to
fellow
ba
senior
for
the
sample
orangishbrown
color
with
minimal
head
the
aroma
is
caramel
malty
spicy
with
a
bit
of
graininess
and
a
hint
of
raisin
there
is
a
definite
alcoholic
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
is
of
sweet
caramel
malt
fruit
and
a
spicy
bitterness
throughout
it
finishes
very
dry
alcoholic
and
bitter
the
bitterness
is
one
that
sticks
with
you
it
is
a
fullbodied
beer
with
a
thick
mouthfeel
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
definitely
sample
this
one
again
a
deep
bemired
brown
color
lots
of
dross
the
head
behemothic
in
size
frothy
in
texture
and
as
it
decays
leaves
a
nice
lace
to
cover
the
glass
the
aroma
of
raisins
and
plums
sweet
malt
black
strap
molasses
hints
of
fusel
alcohol
a
real
big
nose
start
is
like
drinking
maple
syrup
thick
and
chewy
and
the
alcohol
bitterness
hits
you
immediately
finish
has
a
pleasant
hop
spiciness
with
the
acidity
moderate
and
the
aftertaste
dry
as
a
bone
also
alcohol
bitter
a
real
belly
warmer
robust
as
any
barley
wine
ive
tasted
and
one
not
meant
for
the
weak
of
palate
or
those
not
into
alcohol
i
love
it
the
taste
is
big
though
not
exactly
like
the
nose
the
large
aromatic
cookielike
maltiness
is
there
but
so
is
a
big
shot
of
hops
that
were
lying
hidden
under
the
beautiful
aromatics
offsetting
the
potentially
saccharine
sweetness
suggested
by
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
considering
the
og
and
the
abv
this
beer
is
way
more
drinkable
than
it
ought
to
be
for
a
beer
its
size
its
like
bo
jackson
if
he
were
fermented
way
too
agile
for
that
frame
i
think
that
the
relatively
high
degree
of
carbonation
on
this
beer
helps
to
belie
its
strength
somewhat
the
bottle
conditioning
softens
what
would
be
prickly
carbonation
if
this
beer
were
forcecarbonated
adding
the
yeast
trub
to
the
glass
turned
this
beer
downright
murky
but
made
the
head
invincible
and
took
the
fresh
cookie
aromatics
to
a
whole
new
level
interestingly
this
beer
has
just
a
touch
ever
so
subtle
of
the
coriander
taste
that
overwhelmed
my
first
sample
of
bells
two
hearted
ale
i
can
barely
pick
up
a
touch
of
something
unusual
in
the
nosejust
enough
to
get
me
wondering
the
aroma
is
confirmed
if
ever
so
briefly
in
a
very
quick
sensation
between
the
initial
taste
of
the
beer
and
the
finish
during
that
half
a
second
between
my
swallow
and
the
aftertaste
theres
a
hint
of
something
vegetal
and
corianderlike
instantly
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
wit
then
its
gone
and
everythings
awesome
again
other
than
that
glimpse
into
what
i
now
believe
to
be
a
peculiarity
of
larry
bells
yeast
strain
this
is
an
amazing
beer
the
taste
will
take
a
slight
hit
for
that
little
bit
of
nuance
that
comes
back
in
my
burps
to
remind
me
that
alls
not
well
in
kalamazoo
land
otherwise
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
one
ill
search
out
again
bells
third
coast
ale
on
cask
this
is
a
great
example
how
a
wellpoured
cask
beer
can
bring
out
a
complexity
and
a
refreshing
taste
that
might
otherwise
not
have
been
in
the
bottle
goldenhazy
color
with
as
my
notes
indicate
guinness
rings
around
every
sip
this
beer
has
a
wonderful
hops
taste
but
is
not
at
all
dominated
by
the
hops
in
fact
it
has
a
sweetness
that
helps
to
balance
out
the
hops
cool
and
refreshing
very
nice
pours
a
cloudy
amberbrown
with
a
small
head
that
doesnt
seem
to
last
the
smell
is
mostly
hops
with
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
very
complex
in
flavor
sweet
sherry
port
malt
and
hops
are
all
flavors
that
stick
out
to
me
my
favorite
part
is
the
aftertaste
nice
bitterness
it
does
have
a
nice
warming
feeling
in
the
end
dont
have
too
many
of
these
they
will
bite
you
all
larger
praises
must
be
rescinded
as
we
hail
the
king
of
american
barleywines
id
put
this
right
behind
bells

as
my

consider
myself
very
fortunate

these

id
put
this

id
say
that
this
would
make
a
nice

to
sip

reading
at

adds
in
some
toastiness
theres
a
real
earthiness
there
in
the

and
something
that
hints
of
smokiness
it
finishes
with
the
thin

of
the

brew
is
covered
by

is
sweet
caramel
maltiness
with

this

another

from

theres
a

in

effort
but
this
brew
is
a
little
too
alcoholic
and
grainy
for
me
almost
peppery
with
rustic

notes
clearly
strays
into
north
american
barleywine
territory
represents
a
prety
nice

and

even

the
taste
is
similar

a

less

than

would
indicate
its
wellblended

just
a
little
short
in

great
the
folks
over
at
avery
put
together
a
very
strong
offering
which
was
true
to
the
description
on
that
one
a
bitter
barleywinestyle
ale
that
has
just
the
right
amount
of
kick
to
get
you
squealing
but
sweet
enough
to
have
you
going
back
for
more
was
glad
that
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
for
myself
and
would
gladly
do
so
again
to
have
a
break
from
the
norm
well
done
overall
a
disappointment
this
is
supposed
to
be
cellarable
for
3
years
but
6
months
at
a
respectable
liquor
store
makes
it
taste
awful
ill
take
a
pass
next
time
strange
take
on
a
barleywine
not
sure
the
heavy
hops
in
this
beer
are
right
for
the
style
aroma
is
nice
but
it
almost
reminds
me
of
an
over
the
hill
dipa
overall
approximately
9
months
old
and
the
hops
have
certainly
calmed
but
are
far
from
dead
drinks
beautifully
now
and
im
tempted
to
get
another
bottle
and
age
it
for
yet
another
year
or
so
oddly
enough
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
rogues
brutal
bitter
and
also
their
yellow
snow
as
far
as
flavor
is
concerned
just
a
nice
mellow
conglomeration
of
the
caramel
wood
and
citrusy
flavors
not
only
would
i
like
to
age
this
but
id
also
like
to
try
this
fresh
probably
my
favorite
avery
brew
to
date
v
purchased
in
a
22oz
bomber
mediumhigh
value
more
of
a
dipa
than
barley
quite
boozy
for
9
2
o
i
know
this
line
separating
dipas
and
american
barleywines
can
be
blurred
but
this
one
screens
dipa
to
me
its
all
about
the
hops
with
very
little
prominent
malt
characters
still
a
good
beer
and
definitely
worth
a
try
but
not
something
ill
likely
come
back
to
regularly

hog
heaven
pours
a
dark
reddish
color
with
a
small

there
is
a
huge
sharp
aroma
with
a
very
sharp
fresh
unique
hoppines
note
the
taste
is
big
bold
oaky
and
floral
very
sharp
flavors
good
body
and
good
feel
overall
its
a
very
big
and
bold
beer
but
the
flavors
dont
come
together
the
best
way
i
have
decided
that
i
do
not
like
barley
wine
i
came
in
way
under
the
average
yet
again
on
a
barley
wine
this
is
a
borderline
imperial
ipa
you
get
the
big
hop
character
in
the
nose
and
in
the
first
sip
the
resinpine
taste
turns
into
a
toffee
sweet
candy
taste
very
nice
bold
yet
unassuming
my
first
barley
wine
different
for
sure
not
much
head
but
whats
there
is
beige
and
light
aroma
is
carmel
and
fruit
and
yeast
chocolate
caramel
some
fruit
chewy
nice
bitterness
afterwards
back
of
the
throat
pow
not
my
last
barley
wine
o
an
american
barleywine
that
borders
on
the
dipa
hop
action
is
strong
enough
to
meet
the
malts
midway
some
chew
but
mostly
on
the
finish
otherwise
maintains
a
nice
bitterness
that
cuts
through
the
sugars
of
the
malts
i
really
dug
it
think
of
it
as
a
malty
dipa
or
a
hoppy
american
barleywine

a
very

o
decent

wine
drier

i
anticipated
good
flavor
big
bitterness
would
have
rated
higher
but
the
bitter
lingers
too
long
turning
into
an
almost
unpleasant
flavor
not
to
shy
away
though
taste
starts
with
sweet
malt
then
orange
rind
with
a
touch
a
grapefruit
next
is
piney
hops
with
burnt
caramel
malts
has
a
grapefruit
and
dank
hop
finish
which
both
linger
in
the
aftertaste
along
with
more
citrus
rind
feel
is
average
with
high
carbonation
for
the
style
a
little
creamy
and
pretty
chewy
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
since
i
have
500
beers
to
choose
from
at
my
local
store
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
overall
a
serious
bummer
not
bad
but
not
good
on
the
style
not
much
of
a
barley
wine
but
quite
enjoyable
this
is
a
serious
accomplishment
exceptional
balance
and
smoothness
the
only
drawback
for
me
is
the
relentlessness
of
the
grapefruit
on
the
back
end
it
just
wont
quit
which
becomes
a
bit
astringent

really
to

nevertheless
its

beer
that

for

definitely
an

not

its

i
want
in

not
an

a
nice
inner

huge
difference
very
easy
to
drink
and
if
avery
ever
started
to
distro
to
las

id
be
stocked
up
on
this
overall
a
very
solid
american
barleywine
in
this
bottle
the
hops
have
faded
but
retain
an
herbal
bitter
presence
a
nice
nutty
chocolate

was
present

i

along
with
some
very

a
recommend
american

its

overall
mostly
good
beer
with
some
tendencies
toward
above

very
much
an

as
displayed
by
its
vigorous

i
would
give

even

to
see
what

probably

nice
job
guys
note
if
youre
looking
for
a
real
kick
in
the
teeth
avery
will
produce
from
time
to
time
a
double
hopped
barleywine
known
as
the
überschwein
it
is
only
available
directly
at
the
brewery
but
jump
i
encourage
barleywine
fans
to
try
it
the
smoky

flavors
come
alive
even
more
in
that
version
serving

22oz

o
great
beer
i
was
looking
for
a
barleywine
at
least
one
with
more
of
a
balance
but
i
couldnt
consider
this
a
double
ipa
tasty
o
in
summation
averys
hog
heaven
is
big
bold
aggressive
barleywine
that
stands
up
well
against
its
peers
highly
recommended
o
insane
for
4
50
next
time
im
back
im
getting
2
more
bottles
just
wow
one
of
the
best
barleywine
experiences
ive
had
and
ive
had
plenty
i
am
positive
the
age
had
something
to
do
with
it
overall
a
great
beer
that
i
will
buy
again
the
hopforward
aroma
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
barleywine
style
this
is
a
great
bargain
at
6
a
bottle
and
is
always
available
i
need
to
age
one
for
longer
i
have
heard
rumors
that
this
was
really
just
a
dipa
made
before
there
was
that
category
tasty
nonetheless
and
widely
available
here
in
tx
at
specs
o
a
great
barleywine
very
well
balanced
with
a
complex
malt
and
hop
profile
there
are
a
surprising
amount
of
hops
left
in
such
an
old
beer
overall
not
always
a
fan
of
the
hoppy
barleywine
varieties
but
this
one
is
done
very
well
maybe
a
tad
too
much
hops
but
as
for
a
my
palate
is
concerned
i
could
care
less
about
a
lot
of
hops
another
well
done
beer
by
avery
o
recommended
for
the
finish
alone
the
beginning
sweetness
then
later
when
the
hops
and
bitterness
dominate
worth
a
try
unless
overly
hoppy
bitter
beers
scare
you
o
even
after
a
year
in
the
cellar
the
hops
still
command
a
great
deal
of
attention
this
is
an
americanstyle
barleywine
through
and
through
very
smooth
and
drinkable
despite
its
size
this
is
a
beer
that
grows
on
you
with
each
sip
overall
a
little
on
the
dry
side
for
a
barley
wine
i
wouldnt
mind
a
touch
more
sweetness
still
a
good
brew
though
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
as
well
medium
to
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
not
too
sticky
considering
the
style
folks
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
im
drinking
it
in
the
90
degree
heat
of
the
manhattan
summer
and
its
still
really
great
so
get
it
if
you
can
in
the
end
this
is
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
its
pretty
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
though
a
bit
flat
on
the
aroma
and
flavor
the
deep
bitter
aftertaste
is
quite
good
i
would
like
to
see
how
this
beer
is
fresh
because
i
do
think
im
getting
that
flat
oxidized
aroma
on
this
o
very
enjoyable
an
extremely
hoppy
american
barleywine
lots
of
cool
fruity
and
earthy
flavors
going
on
here
another
yes
please
88
barley
wine
is
not
my
favourite
style
but
believe
this
to
be
a
good
example
pours
a
dark
orange
color
off
white
head
leaves
plenty
of
lace
down
the
glass
aroma
of
sweet
malts
light
fruits
citrus
earth
wood
in
the
flavor
lofty
sweetness
balanced
by
a
dry
earthy
bitterness
too
substantially
malty
to
be
considered
a
big
double
ipa
which
is
what
i
first
was
thinking
it
fits
the
bill
of
american
barleywine
full
bodied
syrupy
feel
alcohol
is
present
in
the
taste
and
feel
drinkable
though
it
manages
to
be
rather
bitter
and
quite
sweet
at
the
same
time
not
perfectly
balanced
overall
definitely
a
good
hopped
up
barleywine
o
this
barleywine
isnt
too
difficult
to
drink
given
its
strength
and
that
the
alcohol
doesnt
stand
out
in
the
taste
o
kind
of
feels
somewhere
between
a
very
malty
dipa
and
an
american
barleywine
more
hoppy
flavors
than
expected
for
a
barleywine
and
a
little
too
malty
for
a
dipa
interesting
and
complex
but
maybe
not
one
that
i
would
run
out
to
get
again
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
hoppiest
barleywines
out
there
it
goes
beyond
the
bitter
hops
limit
of
the
average
barleywine
and
beyond
pleasant
this
beer
is
ultrapleasant
i
should
mention
that
i
am
not
a
big
hophead
so
this
lowered
the
drinkability
for
me
however
if
you
are
a
hop
lover
then
you
will
love
hog
heaven
especially
if
you
drink
it
fresh
o
a
very
solid
american
barleywine
from
avery
good
hop
flavor
and
a
good
bit
of
malt
backbone
to
balance
could
have
used
another
612
months
imo
but
still
very
good
one
hell
of
a
beer
this
is
a
gem
find
it
and
drink
it
you
will
love
it
if
you
like
dipas
barleywines
or
hop
forward
beers
hoppy
aftertaste

aboveaverage
american
barleywine
that
set
the
temper
for
the
american
example
for
style
with
sierra
nevadas
bigfoot
bigfoot
is
definitely
a
better
beer
upfront
and
probably
ages
better
too
unfortunately
hog
heaven
is
one
of
those
beers
that
would
have
been
considered
world
class
1015
years
ago
but
has
been
pushed
to
the
back
of
the
bus
by
better
american
examples
like
firestone
walkers
scucaba
or
3fss
behemoth
i
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
unless
superfresh
for
the
big
hop
presence
overall
im
super
hyped
that
my
wegmans
finally
started
carrying
avery
bombers
this
is
a
really
delicious
dryhopped
barleywine
and
at
6
99
its
a
helluva
deal
a
little
hot
and
not
the
most
complex
brew
out
there
but
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
some
more
of
this
o
light
boozy
warmth
is
paired
with
some
simple
characteristics
not
in
love
with
this
one
but
not
bad
if
you
are
looking
for
a
different
way
to
appease
a
hop
head
this
ale
would
be
nice
to
pair
with
a
nice
earthy
style
cigar
which
i
did
on
the
second
half
of
the
bottle
highly
recommended
plus
this
one
ages
with
the
best
of
them
try
it
if
you
got
it
hop
heaven
overall
i
was
quite
unimpressed
expecting
a
real
thick
hop
bomb
and
instead
getting
a
heavy
heavy
yeast
taste
followed
by
some
hoppy
bitterness
o
although
its
not
quite
as
great
as
i
first
remembered
when
i
had
it
this
beer
certainly
does
a
lot
right
it
was
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
i
ever
had
and
it
played
a
good
role
in
moving
me
toward
great
beer
for
that
reason
alone
it
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
overall
a
very
good
american
style
barleywine
very
good
mix
of
hop
flavors
one
of
the
more
hop
forward
barleywines
out
there
o
one
of
the
better
barleywines
i
have
ever
tried
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
i
would
like
to
have
it
again
o
hog
heaven
is
a
completely
decent
bw
but
its
not
something
i
would
seek
out
regularly
p
s
i
had
to
come
back
and
give
the
taste
score
an
additional
25
after
about
an
hour
of
doing
this
reviewthe
flavor
is
really
good
even
as
it
warmsthis
thing
deserves
to
be
in
my
top
10
a
medium
to
full
body
mouth
feel
with
a
creamy
texture
that
coats
your
tongue
pours
amber
with
garnet
highlights
capped
by
a
one
and
a
half
cream
head
caramel
and
pineapple
some
floral
notes
make
up
the
nose
the
taste
follows
the
nose
semi
dry
finish
full
bodied
low
carbonation
fairly
smooth
and
syrupy
overall
a
solid
american
barleywine
and
a
solid
choice
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
overall
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
it
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
the
hoppiness
is
a
bit
too
much
and
takes
away
from
the
strong
malts
that
i
would
prefer
in
this
style
i
would
like
to
try
this
with
a
year
or
so
of
age
to
see
how
it
balances
out
overall
pretty
solid
barleywine
even
though
the
high
bitterness
takes
away
from
traditional
characteristics
this
was
still
an
enjoyable
brew
purchased
this
along
with
aleworks
old
numbskull
for
a
beer
club
barleywine
party
while
better
than
some
of
the
competition
i
wasnt
wowed
by
this
the
hop
bitterness
seemed
to
actually
detract
from
the
dark
rich
flavors
instead
of
complement
them
while
still
tasty
the
clashing
flavors
dont
do
justice
to
how
good
this
could
have
been
maybe
a
different
variety
of
hops
fuggle
or
goldings
maybe
something
less
aggressive
i
feel
that
this
may
have
been
a
young
bottle
curious
to
think
what
a
cellared
bottle
would
mature
into
just
an
outstanding
beer
a
hoppy
barleywine
this
will
not
be
the
last
time
i
have
one
a
big
bold
barleywine
great
hop
character
that
works
with
malt
really
well
overall
an
enjoyable
american
barleywine
plenty
of
hop
flavor
to
go
around
with
some
stick
sweet
malts
not
the
first
american
barleywine
i
would
reach
for
but
it
is
pretty
tasty
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
depth
of
flavoring
through
the
nose
and
the
following
taste
there
were
the
added
niceties
of
butter
wood
and
vanilla
all
of
which
were
highly
inviting
warming
and
comforting
the
stark
bitterness
from
the
hops
struck
an
interesting
contrast
to
this
great
malty
base
making
for
a
truly
balanced
but
unique
and
interesting
tasting
overall
not
a
bad
brew
a
not
too
sweet
or
too
boozy
barleywine
it
isnt
a
powerhouse
of
flavor
like
some
barley
wines
but
has
its
place
as
a
more
subtle
but
pleasant
barleywine
poured
from
a
25
4oz
bottle
into
a
goblet
rich
mahogany
color
slightly
cloudy
great
color
overall
dots
of
foam
cling
to
the
side
of
the
glass
not
much
head
just
a
thin
bit
with
more
at
the
edges
aroma
is
quite
herbal
and
floral
with
lots
of
hops
leading
and
finishing
caramel
and
malt
in
the
middle
with
some
corn
and
molasses
and
some
vegetal
notes
almost
like
squash
or
pumpkin
quaff
begins
sweetly
with
bitterness
of
the
hops
coming
in
toward
the
end
very
feel
mouth
feel
some
heat
from
the
high
alcohol
content
overall
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
final
thoughts
i
guess
im
not
surprised
but
this
one
really
came
through
with
great
flavor
having
never
had
other
barleywines
i
cant
speak
for
how
it
compares
but
it
is
very
good
in
its
own
right
and
makes
me
want
to
seek
out
others
of
the
style
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
im
planning
on
cellaring
a
bottle
or
two
as
well
this
is
complex
malty
hoppy
balanced
and
scarily
drinkable
the
hops
are
intense
and
very
welcomed
this
is
an
incredibly
solid
beer
with
great
complexity
its
definitely
worth
a
try
great
brew
d
much
more
drinkable
this
could
go
down
quick
and
not
even
notice
the
9
abv
moreys
bottom
line
ive
become
more
of
an
englishstyle
barleywine
fan
over
the
years
but
this
is
a
great
example
of
what
an
american
barleywine
is
supposed
to
be
its
relatively
inexpensive
too
will
definitely
have
agian
cheers
happy

why

it
tastes
so
fresh
and
is

the
aroma
is
of
resinous
piney
hops
with
caramel
malts
the
aroma
is
very
hop
forward
the
taste
is
malty
and
dank
from
the
hops
up

the
malt
profile
of
this
beer
provides
breadiness
and
some
sweetness
to
this
beer
the
hop
profile
is
very
piney
and
resinous
it
has
a
nice
balance
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
in
the
flavor
the
flavors
become
much
better
as
the
beer
warms
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
dry
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
the
thing
that
i
like
about
barley
wine
is
that
you
can
sip
on
it
for
hours
you
can
spend
time
detecting
each
unique
flavor
as
you
begin
to
pull
apart
everything
that
went
into
the
beer
unfortunately
this
beer
is
just
a
mess
of
hops
and
alcohol
it
is
hard
to
make
out
anything
distinct
and
the
hops
leave
such
a
bitter
bite
in
your
mouth
that
even
when
you
are
ready
for
the
next
sip
they
are
still
on
your
tongue
pours
out
a
dark
reddish
orange
hue
with
a
foamy
whitehead
that
quickly
thins
out
into
a
nice
lacing
and
retention
in
the
aroma
i
get
the
caramel
hops
toffee
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
a
well
balanced
tastes
of
hops
alcohol
toffee
dark
fruits
snd
citrus
this
beer
has
a
rather
dry
finish
to
it
and
has
a
thick
sticky
feel
to
it
and
is
so
far
the
best
tasting
barley
wine
i
have
tried
thank
you
avery
brewing
for
this
heavenly
brew
if
there
is
a
heaven
and
beer
is
there
i
know
this
would
be
one
of
them
b
o
a
solid
american
barleywine
in
just
about
every
aspect
if
the
taste
could
match
the
aroma
wed
certainly
have
a
big
winner
as
is
it
is
still
significantly
above
average
just
not
outstanding
o
pretty
tasty
barleywine
and
i
am
pretty
sure
that
i
enoyed
this
more
with
the
age
than
i
would
have
fresh
but
i
would
still
like
to
try
this
fresh
or
with
less
time
on
it
to
compare
while
i
prefer
english
style
barleywines
if
i
am
looking
for
an
american
style
this
is
a
tasty
one
at
a
great
price
originally
reviewed

this
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
years
ago
but
i
have
not
tried
it
lately
from
the
22
oz
bottle
i
recommend
picking
up
a
bottle
or
a
dozen
i
aged
tonights
bottle
for
two
years
and
i
dont
regret
it
this
beer
gets
better
with
age
overall
a
really
really
tasty
barleywine
and
im
impressed
with
avery
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
dark
fruit
but
not
a
big
deal
for
such
a
great
tasting
brew
overall
a
very
intensely
flavorful
brew

hoppy

yet
smooth

in

a
big
thanks
goes
out

full
of

with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head

the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet

onion
the
flavor
was
of

onion
hop
grass
earth
and
subtle
citrus
it
had

on
the

overall
this
was
a
fairly
decent
brew
nothing
on
this
one
really
stood
out
to
me
with
the
exception
of
the
onion
presence
i
picked
up
on
the
alcohol
on
this
one
was
really
well
hidden
which
was
a
nice
touch
however
the
onion
presence
was
just
a
little
too
dominant
for
my
palate
and
probably
covered
up
a
lot
of
subtle
flavors
and
aromas
in
this
one
worth
trying
if
you
love

dominated
by
dank

hops
with
just
a
little
bit
of
caramel
present
in
the
background
the
caramel
swirl
that
opens
the
flavor
profile
is
brief

firm
before
a
potent
shot
of

through

the

with
lots
of
piney
hops
marking
this

clear
american
version
of
the

the
sweet
beginning
becomes
a

as
the
beer
warms

just
doesnt
quite

heft

barleywines

be

thicker

held
up
well
for
a
year

not
a

barleywine
by

not

to
give
this
the
push
that
other
barleywines
have
solid
as
heck
in
a
pinch
and
worth
having
several
around
overall
i
like
this
barleywine
will
drink
again
o
i
like
this
with
a
few
months
on
it

fresh
pine

of
with

of
fresh
juicy
peaches
toffee
doughy
and
orange
sweet
in
the

but
the
dry
hops
are
certainly
there
flavor
matches
the
aroma
quite
well
but
not
as
thick
on
the
palate
as
the
aroma
was
on
the
olfactory
senses
starts
off
sweet
some
orange
toffee
that
is
followed
by
the
introduction
of
some
earthy
bitterness
that
stays
with
you
through
the
finish
as
it
warms
the
toffee
and
sweetness
to
this
one
becomes
stronger
and
stronger
a
crisp
maybe
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
my
first
barleywine
and
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
what
i
have
heard
about
the
style
suggested
i
wouldnt
like
it
so
went
out
of
my
way
to
try
this
one
since
i
heard
it
wasnt
typical
for
the
style
not
sure
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
over
all
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
has
me
thinking
super
hoppy
imperial
amber
and
it
certainly
has
a
place
avery
hog

22
oz

the
barleywine
is
a
new
style
for
me
so
factor
that
in
this
avery
brew
has
a
rose
color
to
it
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
head
is
thin
but
still
manages
a
very
artful
lacing
on
the
glass
big
aroma
here
hops
on
the
flowery
side
are
the
main
notes
roses
come
to
mind
the
hog
heaven
is
smooth
with
big
malt
flavor
up
front
and
a
hoppy
finish
that
bring
those
roses
to
mind
again
a
bit
of
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
while
high
in
alcohol
it
does
not
come
through
in
the
flavor
this
avery
effort
is
worth
a
try
but
be
sure
not
to
miss
the
maharaja
or
the
dugana
if
you
like
ipas
or
the
salvation
if
you
like
tripels
tastes
much
like
the
nose
i
cant
get
past
the
feeling
im
drinking
leftover
brussel
sprout
water
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
great
one
the
offflavors
really
bring
this
beer
down
d
tasty
i
like
this
one
overall
the
big
hoppy
flavors
in
the
hog
make
this
barleywine
an
excellent
beer
to
drink
fresh
but
the
complexity
big
flavors
and
high
abv
make
it
a
great
candidate
for
aging
as
well
overall
i
would
be
glad
to
find
it
again
local
but
found
this
one
at
vintage

this
beer
should
have
been
called
hop
heaven
my
overall
impression
was
that
i
was
drinking
an
octanerevved
ipa
not
that
thats
a
bad
thing
i
just
didnt
get
any
of
the
tasting
notes
that
one
would
normally
find
in
a
barley
wine
for
fans
of
ipas
and
i
am
one
you
will
really
enjoy
this
beer
fans
of
barley
wines
might
also
overall
a
really
sippable
brew
the
hops
dont
kill
the
subtle
flavours
i
prefer
the
english
maltdriven
stlye
but
this
is
a
great
subsitute
lighter
more
delicate
flavours
o
oh
god
this
was
exactly
what
i
needed
not
only
did
this
fix
my
craving
for
hops
but
its
really
balanced
every
flavor
is
easily
identifiable
and
upfront
with
each
sip
i
think
im
beginning
to
understand
why
they
call
it
hog
heaven
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
with
bold
hops
but
is
very
balanced
by
all
means
my
friend
pick
this
up
some
beers
have
a
lot
of
hops
but
are
drowned
out
some
have
the
hops
as
the
star
of
the
show
and
very
rarely
every
flavor
is
the
star
of
the
show
and
this
is
hog
heaven
cheers
cheer
cheers
my
friends
enjoy
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
seemingly
lacking
in
complexity
and
overall
enjoyment
despite
its
amazing
appearance
and
alluring
smell
o
i
tasted
the
2010
vintage
of
this
on
tap
during
a
barleywine
festival
and
it
was
one
of
my
favorites
the
delicious
hoppy
and
sweet
flavor
really
set
it
apart
from
some
of
the
fruitier
barleywines
appearance
is
copper
with
a
finger
of
head
that
had
practically
no
retention
but
left
some
nice
lacing
there
is
a
fresh
hop
nose
which
is
a
pleasant
surprise
for
a
barley
wine
some
sweet
malt
hits
upfront
and
then
it
is
followed
by
a
potent
hop
finish
not
quite
true
to
style
but
rebellious
in
a
way
that
i
like
very
much
a
very
different
barleywine
and
awesome
as
a
drink
fresh
barley
wine
would
make
an
interesting
ager
as
well
doa
o
if
you
havent
had
this
yet
it
is
a
musttry
overall
a
fairly
unique
barleywine
not
too
boozy
but
still
more
than
i
like
o
i
like
barleywines
its
just
hard
to
find
a
really
enjoyable
one
where
i
am
this
is
a
good
one
i
will
revisit
sooner
than
later
recommended
not
quite
complex
enough
for
me
in
either
aroma
or
taste
since
the
hop
bitterness
leaves
the
longestlasting
impression
id
probably
opt
to
drink
a
beer
that
does
more
with
its
hops
throughout
and
that
wouldnt
normally
be
a
barelywine
not
the
most
complex
barleywine
but
im
enjoying
the
big
hop
profile
and
the
booze
is
wellhidden
overall
hopheads
will
enjoy
this
beer
simply
because
of
the
sheer
hop
intensity
since
this
is
my
first
barleywine
i
can
easily
say
that
im
impressed
with
this
style
at
least
the
american
style
to
and
i
can
that
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
out
more
barleywinestyle
ales
in
the
future
recommended
this
is
a
wild
beer
not
a
conventional
barleywine
at
all
pours
a
thick
brown
color
with
an
amber
glow
and
a
minimal
head
into
a
snifter
smells
really
hoppy
and
sweet
flavor
is
very
very
hoppy
must
be
dry
hopped
also
though
there
is
a
huge
sweet
malty
strength
to
this
beer
note
of
toffee
and
pine
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
pretty
heavy
not
very
carbonated
and
not
very
drinkable
this
bomber
was
almost
a
chore
to
get
through
overall
not
my
favorite
barleywine
im
not
sure
this
style
is
meant
to
be
so
aggressively
hopped
but
it
is
something
new
anyway
averys
big
bottles
always
push
the
envelope

summary
maybe
not
a
good
barleywine
for
someone
looking
for
a
drink
like
bigfoot
or
horn
dog
but
pretty
great
for
hops
fans
o
wow
really
nice
very
balanced
and
smooth
wish
i
could
have
this
more
often
but
alas
no
avery
in
iowa
time
to
lobby
these
good
folks
to
expand
their
distribution
kinda
wish
the
malt
aroma
was
bigger
this
beer
kinda
reminds
me
of
people
eating
hot
wings
with
crazy
hot
sauce
just
for
the
burn
yea
the
hops
are
like
that
you
need
to
have
this
several
times
to
appreciate
it
this
is
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
most
likely
because
i
love
big
hoppy
imperial
ipa
imperial
red
ales
which
this
could
easily
pass
for
sorry
to
those
bas
that
look
down
on
rating
to
personal
taste
instead
of
to
style
but
this
is
outstanding
i
cant
believe
it
took
me
this
long
to
try
this
one
i
plan
to
buy
more
of
this
soon
o
very
approachable
and
drinkable
lots
of
complexities
although
i
think
the
color
is
a
little
light
for
the
style
i
think
it
is
very
visually
appealing
carbonation
is
spot
on
im
curious
how
it
would
age
but
it
tastes
great
now
i
say
drink
it
up
very
tasty
barleywine
with
a
huge
hop
bitterness
and
presence
great
fresh
or
aged
loved
this
very
american
barleywine
in
that
it
pays
tribute
to
dipas
and
yet
ought
to
cellar
well
for
years
if
you
love
a
hop
bomb
grab
this
if
you
want
something
that
should
keep
well
grab
this
no
worries
about
this
thing
travelling
well
mouthfeel
is
a
little
flat
but
its
thick
and
sticky
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
barleywine
m
filling
coating
barleywine
some
heat
from
the
abv
makes
this
a
great
beer
for
late
december
heavy
in
a
good
way
overall
this
is
a
good
barleywine
i
am
glad
they
are
calling
it
a
barleywine
instead
of
dipa
i
would
give
this
a
much
lower
score
if
that
was
the
case
i
need
to
drink
more
avery
products
4
55
overall
a
good
hop
forward
barleywine
recommended
overall
a
great
barley
wine
nice
hop
balance
and
a
pretty
good
mouth
feel
though
i
wish
it
didnt
have
that
bitter
start
should
mellow
nicely
in
the
bottle
and
age
well
for
a
year
overall
i
always
taste
and
try
before
i
look
anything
up
this
beer
is
going
to
be
one
of
my
faves
avery
caught
my
heart
with
2
other
concoctions
and
now
3
yeah
so
what
the
smell
is
average
it
taste
fn
great
you
are
drinking
a
piece
of
heaven
when
indulging
in
hog
heaven
overall
this
is
amazing
beer
and
i
was
certainly
in
hog
heaven
for
the
majority
of
the
mouthful
so
skillfully
blended
is
the
beer
that
even
though
it
contains
massive
amounts
of
sugars
and
even
more
massive
ibus
none
of
the
ingredients
overpowers
the
others
and
they
instead
work
together
in
lovely
syncopation
only
the
overlypungent
aftertaste
marks
an
unwelcome
twist
to
this
beer
and
while
that
can
easily
be
remedied
by
taking
another
swig
im
not
sure
that
at
9
2
abv
thats
going
to
always
be
a
good
idea
still
for
the
main
mouthful
this
is
a
beer
worth
trying
and
buying
again
o
i
wouldnt
classify
this
as
a
barley
wine
even
an
american
one
its
hopped
overthetop
so
heavily
that
the
majority
of
the
malt
profile
is
overshadowed
a
good
beer
regardless
hog
heaven
is
a
hop
bomb
overall
a
very
good
bw
i
wish
i
knew
the
vintage
if
you
have
had
a
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
this
one
taste
like
a
two
year
old
one
will
have
more
in
the
future
84
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
i
think
overall
it
fell
short
i
think
it
probably
would
get
better
with
age
othis
is
the
best
barleywine
i
have
had
imo
fyi
i
havent
had
a
lot
however
reminds
me
a
lot
of
brewdog
hardcore
in
flavour
profile
but
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
coming
through
and
a
little
deficient
carbwise
still
good
o
a
very
nice
barleywine
it
is
better
than
the
reverand
which
i
had
last
night
4s
across
the
board
a
great
aroma
but
thats
about
all
i
wont
be
drinking
this
again
on
top
of
the
excellent
flavor
it
was
4
50
for
a
12oz
draught
in
the
proper
glass
at
a
local
watering
hole
high
end
of
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
solid
amount
of
carbonation
to
support
the
big
nature
of
this
beer
but
it
still
drinks
pretty
thick
seems
appropriate
o
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
barleywine
excellent
appearance
and
flavour
profile
would
like
to
get
my
hands
on
a
bottle
of
this
to
try
and
age
it
drinkability
a
sipper
and
a
little
much
for
me
personally
that
being
said
its
a
good
barleywine
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
barleywine
its
pretty
solid
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
like
most
of
the
barleywines
i
have
had
and
very
malt
forward
but
once
i
looked
at
the
label
and
saw
this
was
a
100
ibus
i
knew
this
was
going
to
be
heavy
on
the
hops
and
it
was
but
a
lot
those
nice
citrus
hop
aromas
never
made
their
way
to
the
flavor
but
all
their
bitterness
did
this
beer
is
a
sipper
so
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
drinkability
i
am
glad
i
am
splitting
this
bomber
with
my
brother
the
high
bitterness
and
very
noticeable
9
2
of
alcohol
give
this
beer
a
low
amount
of
drinkability
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
and
look
it
had
a
nice
mixture
of
citrus
fruits
mixed
with
sweet
caramel
malts
its
smelled
like
a
good
dipa
and
it
looked
really
good
in
my
snifter
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
bitterness
and
the
booziness
if
both
were
toned
down
little
it
would
help
the
flavor
out
and
make
this
beer
much
more
drinkable
i
could
see
buying
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
a
hoppy
barleywine
it
also
was
a
pretty
good
value
for
6
49
but
i
tend
to
like
my
barleywines
more
balanced
so
i
would
for
sure
choose
third
coast
old
ale
over
this
beer
this
beer
is
worth
giving
a
try
especially
if
you
like
barleywines
heavy
on
the
hops
this
was
my
second
beer
from
avery
and
so
far
i
think
they
are
good
brewing
company
i
would
like
to
try
more
of
their
beers
not
my
favorite
barleywine
but
still
a
solid
hoppy
barleywine
this
might
be
a
good
beer
to
age
to
see
what
it
turns
it
turns
into
when
the
hops
fade
first
sip
gives
hop
bitterness
burst
and
follows
with
a
caramel
back
end
light
mouth
feel
hops
win
out
a
supremely
solid
example
of
an
american
bw
and
an
unaged
sample
at
that
perhaps
one
of
these
days
ill
conceive
the
courage
to
buy
one
and
hide
it
from
myself
until
then
bravo
avery
o
a
hop
forward
barleywine
not
the
best
but
very
good
this
is
my
first
barleywine
review
and
only
my
second
ever
tasting
one
pours
a
deep
copper
with
lots
of
brown
in
it
a
half
inch
off
white
colored
head
quickly
settles
to
a
ring
with
lots
of
patchy
lacing
i
detect
with
my
nose
lots
of
malts
brown
sugar
and
citrus
the
tastebuds
are
greeted
with
loads
of
brown
sugar
sweetness
a
malty
backbone
that
carries
thru
to
the
dry
biterness
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
sticky
creamy
almost
chewy
overall
this
is
very
drinkable
with
the
alochol
hidden
behind
the
sweetness
however
as
this
warms
the
alochol
is
more
dominant
pour
a
slightly
hazy
copper
orange
with
a
1
inch
puffy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
toffee
brown
sugar
and
lots
of
citrus
zest
aromas
alcohol
aromas
come
out
as
the
beer
warms
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
caramel
and
zesty
citrus
zest
flavors
a
mild
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
crisp
carbonation
with
a
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
an
alcohol
warmth
hits
the
back
of
the
throat
after
each
sip
overall
this
is
a
good
but
hoppy
barleywine
with
an
alcohol
kick
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
with
suprisingly
floral
hoppy
aroma
dark
amber
body
with
a
slightly
frothy
head
that
sticks
around
nice
hop
punch
to
begin
with
that
melts
into
a
carmel
malt
finish
palate
is
full
bodied
with
a
creamy
texture
carbonation
is
slightly
fizzy
with
a
long
finish
overall
the
best
barleywine
i
have
tried
so
far
odgets
better
as
it
warms
up
that
being
said
i
like
the
intensity
of
the
flavors
but
i
do
not
specifically
like
the
overall
flavor
not
my
favorite
hop
profile
alcohol
isnt
necessarily
too
bold
but
it
is
poorly
masked
did
not
live
up
to
my
expectations
still
decent
at
8
50
for
a
bomber
not
a
deal
either
a
bit
too
much
head
and
carbonation
but
the
head
does
dissipate
quickly
enough
hog
heaven
is
a
murky
redorange
color
with
two
fingers
of
fluffy
head
aroma
is
a
nice
pungent
hop
over
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
really
the
same
thing
another
big
beer
with
plenty
of
bright
citrusy
hops
over
an
assertive
caramel
malt
backbone
its
nice
but
youve
had
this
before
mouthfeel
is
big
and
wellcarbed
and
the
drinkability
is
about
average
this
is
a
good
hopforward
beer
thats
probably
closer
to
maltheavy
dipas
like
90
minute
in
fact
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
90
minute
its
really
not
worth
the
price
premium
over
it
o
quite
good
but
definitely
not
one
i
could
drink
all
of
the
time
still
quite
refreshing
and
one
i
will
revisit
ever
couple
of
months
an
imperial
hoppy
red
ale
barleywine
mix
this
is
great
fresh
and
i
would
like
to
see
what
some
age
would
do
to
this
although
i
wont
have
the
willpower
to
keep
my
hands
off
of
it
poured
a
reddish
orange
some
lighter
chestnut
and
brown
hues
small
fluffy
white
lace
that
leaves
some
good
lace
and
retains
very
nicely
nose
is
nicely
hopped
lots
of
orange
pine
and
some
grapefruit
a
big
sweetness
is
evident
almost
straight
sugar
more
saccharine
notes
as
i
keep
digging
some
caramel
candied
apple
i
guess
as
im
getting
huge
caramel
notes
and
some
light
red
delicious
apple
notes
as
well
taste
is
sweet
almost
overly
so
more
candied
notes
caramel
in
the
finish
with
big
hop
notes
as
per
the
nose
sticky
and
lightly
boozy
mouthfeel
very
sweet
and
only
moderately
drinkable
this
sample
was
sufficient
full
bodied
and
a
real
sipper
split
a
bottle
if
youve
got
one
to
open
i
honestly
dislike
this
its
a
different
experience
though
i
guess
some
people
might
enjoy
this
but
i
am
going
to
stay
away
from
barleywines
from
now
on
this
is
what
i
would
think
vodka
grapefruit
taste
like
but
hey
its
not
something
i
would
even
attempt
if
you
love
grapefruits
then
this
is
the
drink
for
you
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
had
anything
of
the
grapefruit
variety
in
years
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
barley
wine
and
i
think
hog
heaven
could
age
gracefully
the
hop
character
could
use
a
bit
more
complexity
but
you
can
not
beat
hop
heavens
drinkability
probably
the
best
nonaged
barley
wine
ive
had
cheers
big
and
bold
flavor
here
it
says
104
ibus
on
the
bottle
and
while
it
is
definitely
bitter
it
is
a
very
well
balanced
bitterness
the
bitterness
seems
to
come
in
strong
at
the
back
of
the
palate
and
then
slowly
ease
up
as
complex
flavors
of
dried
fruit
caramel
malts
and
a
warming
breath
of
alcohol
the
dried
fruit
is
very
subdued
but
im
getting
a
taste
of
apricot
from
somewhere
as
it
warms
the
caramel
comes
out
more
in
a
way
that
complements
the
floral
hops
very
well
the
dryhopping
is
evident
in
its
dry
and
crisp
mouthfeel
but
juicy
finish
not
to
mention
the
huge
floral
hop
taste
overall
this
is
a
pretty
fantastic
beer
and
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
tasted
the
intense
bitterness
makes
for
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
one
that
im
enjoying
very
much
nicely
done
avery
i
like
this
beer
yes
its
big
and
would
be
better
suited
and
perhaps
more
enjoyable
to
sip
this
during
a
cold
winter
storm
but
i
live
in
the
goddam
rio
grande
valley
where
winter
never
arrives
so
i
make
due
a
solid
flavorful
barley
wine
great
hop
character
thoroughly
enjoyed
o
this
one
surprised
the
hell
out
of
me
and
is
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
tried
in
a
long
time
its
sort
of
like
marharaja
1
5
if
that
tells
you
anything
o
nice
robust
flavors
lots
of
complexity
not
my
favorite
flavors
in
a
barleywine
but
that
is
more
due
to
personal
preference
than
the
beer
pretty
fine
barley
wine
overall
worth
the
price
of
admission
o
this
beer
has
a
special
place
in
my
heart
it
was
my
first
bw
that
i
enjoyed
i
also
developed
a
clone
of
this
beer
for
my
wedding
and
modified
it
slightly
to
become
kimbarley
wine
that
being
said
i
now
feel
like
the
hops
in
this
are
a
little
over
done
and
the
beer
lacks
the
malt
profile
to
help
balance
it
in
a
fashion
my
palate
prefers
i
can
say
proudly
that
as
soon
as
i
smelled
this
it
reminded
me
of
my
wedding
bw
its
pretty
awesome
o
avery
does
a
good
job
of
blending
the
malty
dark
fruit
world
with
the
punchinghops
world
and
this
is
a
good
example
of
such
bridge
building
nothing
miraculous
but
a
good
beer
here
i
enjoyed
drinking
to
the
end
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
example
of
great
american
barleywines
i
would
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
when
winter
comes
around
o
for
me
a
run
of
the
mill
barleywine
will
have
to
try
again
as
i
truly
believe
that
the
bottle
erupting
probably
downgrades
my
review
i
am
a
huge
barleywine
fan
in
general
this
barleywine
style
ale
is
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
for
my
liking
o
this
is
my
first
take
with
a
hop
forward
barleywine
and
i
must
say
i
really
love
it
like
a
really
sweet
fruity
iipa
avery
seldom
disappoints
o
im
enjoying
this
dipabarleywine
the
only
reason
i
feel
like
im
going
to
rate
it
a
little
lower
is
the
class
that
it
is
in
and
im
rating
it
against
the
style
but
other
than
that
it
is
a
good
brew
and
nice
change
of
pace
o
no
suprises
with
this
one
its
a
very
solid
abw
maybe
a
lttle
on
tyhe
malty
side
overall
a
solid
beer
but
not
something
i
would
pursue
again
i
like
the
style
but
definitely
would
try
other
things
first
the
bottle
is
cute
i
really
like
the
label
it
has
you
guessed
it
a
hog
on
the
front
the
label
is
also
pink
my
favorite
color
which
is
fitting
considering
the
name
i
feel
like
i
have
had
this
beer
before
but
maybe
not
not
sure
regardless
this
is
a
great
beer
and
has
a
ton
of
ipa
characteristics
about
it
it
has
a
pretty
big
abv
as
well
so
if
you
want
to
drink
these
maybe
only
order
a
couple
of
bottles
the
beer
doesnt
smell
nor
taste
like
alcohol
this
is
a
composite
of
a
couple
experiences
with
fresh
bottles
sadly
i
have
not
enjoyed
any
of
them
despite
my
enjoyment
of
this
one
on
tap
i
might
have
to
give
it
one
more
shot
someday
but
not
right
now
poured
amber
with
a
good
white
head
nose
is
all
hops
some
grapefruit
and
pine
but
mostly
cat
piss
on
the
palate
this
is
one
is
medium
to
full
bodied
lots
of
hops
although
the
malt
balances
them
somewhat
and
the
flavor
is
an
improvement
on
the
nose
o
i
like
it
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
but
its
pretty
good
o
if
this
beer
was
a
little
less
dry
i
have
a
feeling
i
wouldve
liked
it
better
still
its
good
and
worth
picking
up
if
youve
never
tried
it
before
o
on
par
with
most
any
good
quality
barley
wine
that
ive
had
which
is
to
say
that
id
seek
this
one
out
for
a
barley
wine
jones
on
most
any
day
overall
first
avery
ive
ever
had
big
thanks
to
my
girlfriends
mother
for
thinking
of
me
while
in
colorado
this
beer
is
very
good
and
different
than
most
barleywines
ive
had
if
i
were
closer
to
their
distribution
area
then
i
would
be
being
this
by
the
cartfull
until
then
ill
enjoy
the
one
in
hand
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
barleywine
nice
job
by
avery
o
im
a
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
to
begin
with
so
keep
that
in
mind
but
this
is
i
can
say
a
very
good
one
drinkable
smooth
and
not
a
hopbob
like
some
barleywines
seem
to
be
going
these
days
i
really
am
enjoying
this
one
and
could
see
stocking
up
on
a
few
more
bottles
avery
does
a
good
job
with
their
stuff
in
general
and
this
one
is
no
different
d
i
really
like
this
barleywine
ive
never
had
one
with
quite
as
much
hop
flavor
and
the
sweetness
and
toffee
flavor
is
really
pleasant
this
brew
pours
a
hazy
deep
amber
hue
with
average
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
one
finger
head
and
sporadic
clingy
lacingthe
smell
is
straight
out
sticky
honey
laden
hops
and
sweet
caramel
maltsit
has
a
nice
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
which
is
averagely
carbonated
and
has
tastes
of
sweet
boiled
candytoffeegrapefruitbrown
sugarcaramel
and
sweet
sticky
honey
laden
hops
and
overall
this
brew
is
nice
and
pretty
much
a
hop
bomb
and
probably
one
of
the
better
examples
of
this
style
cheers
overall
a
very
solid
bw
quite
flavorful
and
very
enjoyable
i
do
think
this
is
a
prime
candidate
for
aging
reminds
me
a
bit
of
sn
bigfoot
will
be
buying
this
again
this
is
a
strange
barley
wine
its
like
an
offspring
of
an
imperial
ipa
and
a
barley
wine
it
was
an
okay
beer
but
i
dont
know
what
category
i
would
put
it
in
i
would
drink
this
again
having
looked
at
other
reviews
im
not
getting
any
of
the
fruit
or
much
of
the
complexity
described
so
its
possible
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
barley
wine
it
was
quite
enjoyable
however
it
does
need
some
age
on
it
to
round
out
a
few
of
its
rough
edges
this
is
a
really
good
beer
overall
but
bordering
on
exceptional
for
the
style
instead
of
just
punching
you
in
the
gut
with
hoppy
bitterness
and
high
abv
its
almost
smooth
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
sweet
finish
rock
solid
offering
that
would
likely
age
very
well
poured
from
a
chilled
bomber
into
a
snifter
it
appears
as
a
dark
hazy
amber
color
with
slight
head
and
sticky
lacing
aroma
is
of
cherries
oak
barley
hops
some
floral
hints
also
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
taste
is
of
the
same
as
aroma
very
good
barleywine
o
unfortunately
i
have
little
experience
tasting
this
style
and
none
reviewing
it
that
being
said
i
wish
i
had
let
this
one
age
a
little
so
the
hops
would
calm
down
before
tasting
it
i
enjoyed
it
and
am
encouraged
to
explore
this
style
more
this
is
a
full
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
quite
americanized
in
the
style
with
an
exaggerated
amount
of
hop
characteristics
with
oily
bitterness
that
isnt
bad
the
alcohol
inclusion
is
not
hidden
at
all
in
both
flavor
and
warmth
i
have
a
bottle
of
this
that
is
more
than
a
year
old
having
this
on
tap
satisfied
my
curiosity
i
wont
be
opening
the
bottle
for
at
least
another
year
or
so
overall
is
good
not
the
greatest
barleywine
in
the
world
but
worth
having
again
almost
more
like
a
really
big
malty
ipa
finally
getting
around
to
reviewing
this
after
quaffing
several
over
the
years
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
into
a
taller
pilsner
glass
poured
a
nice
ruby
red
color
with
a
head
that
lingered
for
a
good
while
and
a
lacing
that
stuck
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
after
several
swigs
i
could
tell
it
would
be
hoppier
by
the
aroma
taste
is
where
i
put
my
emphasis
caramel
malt
and
a
bit
of
fruitiness
with
a
fair
bitterness
finish
that
stays
with
ya
this
is
another
nice
effort
from
adam
and
co
its
great
fresh
yes
adam
and
ratman
but
i
tend
to
like
it
aged
a
bit
to
let
some
of
the
hops
fade
a
bit
btw
the
new
label
is
nice
a
nice
hefty
barleywine
with
a
hop
after
taste
a
bit
cloying
but
still
nice
overallgood
not
great
very
different
interpretation
of
a
barleywine
would
rather
go
to
other
barleywines
before
i
go
back
to
this
one
pours
a
nice
dark
ambermahogany
hue
with
a
thick
almost
violent
cream
white
head
almost
three
fingers
deep
i
can
even
see
in
the
bottle
lots
of
head
smells
of
hops
lots
of
citrus
grapefruit
very
smooth
texture
then
wham
kaboom
hop
bomb
those
hops
waste
no
time
attacking
the
pallet
despite
the
hops
this
comes
off
as
very
smooth
it
has
a
nice
malt
finish
that
isnt
too
sugary
but
definitely
sweet
but
then
is
intercepted
by
some
more
hops
hops
hops
hops
very
much
part
of
the
west
coast
tradition
of
hoppy
barley
wines
a
few
more
months
of
aging
and
the
malts
would
probably
show
some
more
but
still
wouldnt
impress
me
much
the
taste
is
quality
with
good
hop
flavor
and
mild
caramel
in
the
malt
more
stone
fruit
than
anything
coming
from
the
yeastmalt
blend
and
mild
piney
bitter
hop
accents
the
taste
has
subtle
sweetness
in
the
finish
which
seems
to
lessen
the
impact
of
the
alcohol
which
is
present
in
the
taste
overall
i
think
this
is
a
quality
barlewyine
i
am
not
sure
why
it
took
me
this
long
to
review
it
perhaps
i
did
but
misplaced
the
notes
i
have
had
it
a
few
times
and
still
remember
the
first
time
at
kclingers
in
hanover
i
think
it
fits
the
style
well
and
i
am
glad
i
got
to
have
it
again
mf
full
bodied
thick
and
chewy
a
little
hot
but
manageable
for
a
barley
wine
splits
the
difference
between
a
dipa
and
a
barleywine
a
great
longtime
sipper
love
this
beer
o
really
mediocre
and
underwhelming
i
guess
at
least
it
wasnt
harsh
and
hot
like
a
lot
of
high
gravity
avery
beers
verdict
great
beer
shy
of
elite
but
if
you
had
me
wrapped
in
wonder
woman
s
golden
lasso
yeah
thats
it
id
admit
id
buy
it
again
easy
to
drink
solid
beer
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
nice
warmth
slips
into
your
legs
as
the
flavors
rekindle
your
spirit
barleywines
have
been
hit
and
miss
for
me
this
one
though
im
glad
is
a
hit
this
is
also
my
first
beer
from
avery
so
im
off
to
a
good
start
pours
an
amber
color
with
huge
head
smells
of
hops
i
take
a
sip
and
i
get
more
hops
and
some
alcohol
but
not
a
lot
this
is
a
smooth
barleywine
i
say
that
because
the
last
barleywine
i
had
was
rough
and
i
could
barely
drink
it
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
would
considered
buying
it
again
mouthfeel
is
puckering
and
refreshing
at
the
same
time
d
very
tart
and
complex
flavor
combination
of
hops
nice
balance
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
even
bought
a
second
bottle
though
ill
probably
top
there
mostly
due
to
my
soft
spot
for
columbus
hops
but
i
would
have
liked
a
little
less
syrup
and
a
little
more
kick
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
clear
ruby
coloring
with
a
chunky
tall
beige
tower
of
foamy
head
the
head
recedes
a
little
while
drinking
but
manages
to
maintain
throughout
the
beer
as
a
whole
smells
are
so
well
blended
that
it
is
hard
to
pick
out
but
here
goes
i
get
a
lot
of
fruit
notes
but
subtle
almost
an
apple
pie
type
smell
with
apples
and
cinnamon
but
other
spices
present
also
definite
malty
notes
in
the
nose
too
the
beer
has
a
strong
malt
backbone
with
sour
notes
flowering
off
as
well
as
a
smooth
spicy
characteristic
that
is
a
little
cinnamon
and
a
little
nutmeg
other
flavors
include
some
dark
fruits
like
prunes
and
raisins
as
well
as
some
booze
tastes
the
beer
is
remarkably
smooth
for
all
the
flavors
but
the
aftertaste
lingers
quite
a
while
the
aftertaste
consists
of
the
spices
as
well
as
a
sour
undertone
the
finish
is
dry
and
leaves
the
palate
wanting
more
very
interesting
barleywine
d
great
beer
easy
drinker
i
only
wish
it
was
colder
outside
so
i
had
an
excuse
to
drink
more
of
it
overall
this
was
a
well
done
barleywine
i
dont
recall
having
a
barleywine
that
tasted
like
honey
and
hops
they
could
add
a
little
more
hops
in
there
to
balance
out
some
of
the
sweetness
but
i
still
really
enjoyed
this
beer
d
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
smooth
and
all
the
aspects
of
the
beer
work
really
well
together
the
flavor
is
great
and
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
without
it
getting
old
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
recommend
trying
it

something
off

the

ive
had
this

before
ill
certainly
have
it
again
a
great
beer
for
a
great
price
i
will
definitely
be
back
for
more
this
was
a
very

must
be
difficult
with
this
style
that
has

style
though
i
do
prefer
this
fresh
it
does
age
well
but
it
is
a
different
beer
at
this
point
d
3
5
this
is
a
cleantasting
barleywine
with
a
real
emphasis
on
american
hops
id
like
to
see
more
balance
and
complexity
but
that
is
purely
my
preference
yet
another
quality
offering
from
avery
d
wow
this
one
is
a
monster
definitely
more
highly
hopped
than
most
others
in
the
style
which
i
enjoy
as
an
ipa
fan
it
is
a
very
bold
beer
and
certainly
is
more
straightforward
than
other
bwines
that
are
meant
to
be
aged
to
bring
out
the
flavor
aging
this
would
likely
diminish
the
flavor
profile
as
the
hops
bouquet
is
such
a
significant
component
this
is
a
delicious
beer
and
i
will
definitely
seek
it
out
again
well
done
for
an
aggressive
barleywine
d
the
full
hop
punch
is
more
pungent
and
woody
and
dominates
the
sweet
caramel
malt
it
is
a
nice
sipper
but
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
to
the
straight
bitterness
this
beer
is
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
given
the
abv
ill
drink
this
when
pigs
fly
oh
apparently
the
label
has
informed
me
that
the
time
has
come
it
pours
a
lightly
hazy
rubyamber
topped
by
a
fingerandahalf
of
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
toffee
caramel
slight
pine
and
a
vague
sense
of
red
wine
more
a
rose
but
hey
i
aint
no
wine
expert
here
the
taste
holds
notes
of
strong
pine
and
grapefruit
rind
light
onion
and
a
thoroughly
dominated
carameltoffee
blend
in
the
background
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
a
dry
finish
and
a
nearly
chewy
feel
overall
a
solid
bwine
but
a
bit
much
for
me
to
necessarily
enjoy
regularly
this
is
a
gorgeous
barleywine
that
due
to
the
intense
hop
factor
will
also
please
ipa
lovers
d
one
of
the
better
barley
wines
i
have
had
definitely
would
like
to
try
again
a
sipper
with
not
my
favorite
hop
profile
but
still
surprisingly
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
a
well
made
barleywine
it
was
pretty
decent
very
smooth
but
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
i
poured
about
2
ounces
in
2
glasses
one
for
me
the
other
for
my
roommate
he
didnt
dig
it
and
neither
did
i
so
i
rebottled
it
hopefully
some
age
will
sort
this
puppy
out
at
least
it
will
let
some
of
those
100
ibus
mellow
out
a
bit
not
to
hopeful
about
the
malt
flavor
but
only
time
will
tell
dnot
very
high
coming
in
at
a
9
20
there
isnt
a
lot
of
room
for
you
to
sit
back
and
pound
these
all
night
also
this
is
just
a
sickly
sweet
barleywine
i
would
start
with
someone
else
if
youve
never
been
introduced
to
the
style
drinkability
i
prefer
my
barleywines
a
little
less
sweet
but
this
one
isnt
half
bad
pretty
good
for
a
barleywine
low
carbonation
heavy
body
and
high
sugar
leads
to
a
lightly
syrupy
sensation
that
keeps
the
mouthfeel
from
scoring
higher
and
vaulting
this
into
the
upperechelon
of
american
barleywines
but
the
feel
is
good
enough
to
keep
me
sipping
just
about
every
second
until
my
glass
is
empty
the
drinkability
approaches
the
divine
but
falls
just
short
still
a
very
good
beer
when
youre
ready
to
consume
a
pigload
of
calories
reach
for
a
hog
drinkability
nice
flavors
and
a
big
robust
nose
make
it
very
appealing
abv
is
pretty
big
though
and
the
weight
would
become
a
bit
of
a
factor
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
a
couple
more
of
these
up
and
leaving
them
sit
for
at
least
2
more
years
to
allow
it
to
mellow
a
bit
and
see
how
it
does
d
this
barleywine
is
a
couple
of
years
old
and
i
think
it
hit
its
prime
right
here
a
good
hit
from
avery
for
me
at
least
the
higher
abv
is
kind
of
hidden
toward
the
end
which
comes
through
a
sharp
alcohol
hit
and
then
its
gone
pours
a
moderate
copper
color
with
a
very
thin
off
white
bit
of
lacing
after
a
small
head
on
the
initial
pour
sell
brings
citrus
and
floral
hops
and
a
large
amount
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
mess
with
a
large
dose
of
hops
that
are
somehow
overpowered
by
an
even
larger
dose
of
sweetness
doesnt
carry
very
much
depth
feel
is
fairly
heavy
with
low
to
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
hampered
by
the
taste
just
kind
of
being
everywhere
a
strange
barleywine
that
might
do
better
with
some
age
first
glass
pours
a
dark
clear
amber
brown
the
second
glass
pours
a
nice
hazy
dark
brown
amber
colour
again
love
the
floaties
in
the
second
glass
tastes
of
sweet
dark
malts
with
a
little
hops
kicking
in
there
too
drinks
pretty
smooth
over
over
9
alc
quite
the
tasty
american
barley
wine
one
of
my
favourites
to
this
point
22oz
bottle
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
thin
head
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
boozey
and
hoppy
sweet
taste
is
more
hops
than
i
expected
slight
warming
alcohol
flavor
but
not
a
real
boozey
barleywine
heavy
beer
that
is
certainly
a
sipper
overall
a
hoppy
barleywine
that
is
more
like
bigfoot
than
say
olde
school
i
enjoyed
sipping
this
one
and
will
probably
grab
one
again
d
the
9
2
abv
means
it
drinks
like
a
wine
and
should
probably
be
treated
like
one
i
was
happy
to
finish
off
a
bomber
and
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
especially
when
the
weather
turns
a
bit
colder
d
it
drank
pretty
good
for
the
style
but
imo
it
was
too
hoppy
and
bitter
for
a
barleywine
i
really
dont
look
for
hoppiness
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
in
this
stlye
might
as
well
pick
up
an
ipa
d
a
delight
allaround
seriously
good
barleywine
here
avery
hog
heaven
is
a
cloudy
apple
cider
color
it
has
a
real
mix
of
orange
and
brown
tints
as
well
the
head
was
there
and
then
gone
leaving
just
a
thin
film
on
the
side
of
the
glass
sweet
sweet
sweet
all
i
smell
are
rich
malts
and
honey
notes
the
sweet
follows
right
on
the
tongue
with
a
lot
of
fruit
i
get
some
apricot
peach
a
little
cherry
and
raisins
wow
some
tartness
lingers
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
followed
by
the
slightest
hint
of
heat
from
the
alcohol
i
wouldnt
say
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
because
of
the
intense
flavors
it
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
it
does
however
have
great
appeal
to
a
quiet
night
by
a
fire
place
with
a
mixture
of
dried
fruits
and
salt
covered
walnuts
cashews
and
almonds
d
easy
to
drink
easy
to
love
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
barlywines
i
have
ever
had
d
one
of
best
most
drinkable
american
barleywines
ive
tried
dthe
drinkability
is
quiet
high
on
this
beer
well
hidden
abv
and
bright
hoppiness
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
was
difficult
to
differentiate
between
this
being
a
barleywine
or
just
another
solid
double
ipa
a
bit
more
light
bodied
than
expected
for
style
good
beer
but
not
really
what
i
expect
for
a
bw
d
yum
enough
said
towards
the
end
more
butterscotch
comes
through
with
notes
of
clove
and
cinnamon
resting
against
the
utterly
smooth
palate
of
this
beer
it
is
not
very
complex
just
elegant
and
divine
showing
you
its
true
colors
right
out
in
the
open
the
mouthfeel
is
so
fantastically
easy
and
clean
it
takes
a
monstrous
beer
and
tames
it
perfectly
the
finish
is
dry
and
slightly
quenching
with
still
the
sweet
candy
malts
in
my
mouth
and
a
hint
of
tart
fresh
hops
really
a
delicious
experience
try
it
with
dense
chocolate
deserts
a
wide
array
of
cheeses
or
hearty
beef
stew
poured
a
clearish
auburn
brown
with
a
2finger
head
that
slowly
receeded
on
top
of
a
real
hoppy
aroma
citric
and
tealike
with
hints
of
grape
and
dark
fruit
as
well
as
a
touch
of
yeast
and
sweet
malt
malt
overload
as
a
dry
breadydoughy
medium
body
w
a
touch
of
alcohol
bleeding
as
well
as
some
caramel
toffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
are
in
there
as
well
for
a
touch
of
sweetness
even
has
a
bit
of
sticky
syrupiness
some
bitter
herbal
hops
and
fruits
like
grape
and
orange
are
in
there
as
well
although
the
malts
are
more
powerful
the
finish
is
dry
and
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
on
the
backend
but
overall
a
dry
husky
yet
sweet
and
flavorful
barleywine
that
is
a
good
try
at
this
style
d
a
good
beer
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
not
on
par
with
averys
dark
beers
got
this
one
for
fathers
day
this
year
pours
this
one
into
a
tulip
pours
a
dark
copper
amber
color
big
fluffy
off
white
head
on
this
one
with
really
nice
lacing
im
not
loving
the
smell
on
this
its
kind
of
musty
im
sharing
this
with
my
brother
and
he
said
it
smelled
like
faded
hops
i
would
agree
with
that
dark
fruit
aromas
also
around
id
say
it
smells
sweet
as
i
expected
its
kind
of
sweet
caramel
up
front
and
dark
fruits
and
a
somewhat
metallic
finnish
not
bad
i
do
feel
like
fresh
this
would
be
a
hoppy
one
id
love
to
get
a
hold
of
a
fresh
bottle
but
i
did
sit
on
this
one
for
about
a
month
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
and
syrupy
with
low
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
and
this
one
and
im
enjoying
sipping
it
newer
offering
is
resinous
pine
hoppiness
but
surprisingly
smooth
with
toffee
burnt
biscuit
maltiness
in
tow
tropical
alcohol
and
bitter
on
the
finish
07
is
much
smoother
as
expected
burnt
cakebottom
malts
still
are
complimented
by
a
nice
hop
bitterness
sherrylike
alcohol
is
much
smoother
than
the
younger
version
but
still
biting
pleasant
with
some
rough
edges
still
poking
through
that
would
probably
never
smooth
out
more
dark
fruit
in
the
older
version
and
more
complex
to
my
tastebuds
it
aged
well
i
thought
but
not
might
improve
any
more
very
fun
comparison
i
prefer
the
aged
version
make
sure
you
have
a
friend
or
two
to
share
with
drinking
two
of
these
behemoths
id
get
this
again
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
ill
have
to
age
another
two
years
instead
i
have
forgotten
to
stock
this
beer
lately
and
that
is
a
shame
it
is
a
damn
good
barleywine
no
problem
though
i
purchased
this
beer
yesterday
from
a
highvolume
location
and
it
doesnt
need
more
time
to
develop
character
excellant
d
drinks
quickly
and
often
strong
and
flavorful
excellent
representation
of
the
style
good
hops
and
malts
a
definite
musttry
for
fans
of
the
style
d
not
too
drinkable
one
bomber
was
enough
for
me
full
bodied
smooth
and
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
higher
than
i
would
like
has
a
bitter
and
somewhat
dry
finish
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
9
20
this
beer
is
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
d
a
very
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
albeit
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
overall
and
this
may
get
a
bit
better
with
some
age
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
three
inches
of
tan
head
it
is
a
copper
colored
offering
the
aroma
is
some
citrus
hops
and
caramel
malt
i
smelled
hops
as
soon
as
i
started
pouring
into
my
glass
the
hop
flavor
overpowers
the
malt
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
balanced
im
not
saying
that
it
tastes
bad
i
just
need
more
balance
m
just
shy
of
full
bodied
crisp
carbonated
and
nearly
dry
d
big
beer
flavor
profile
is
very
wide
and
covers
alcohol
well
i
believe
it
is
a
bottle
from
2008
i
like
this
definitely
an
american
barleywine
with
a
big
hop
kick
but
more
balanced
than
some
ive
tried
ill
definitely
have
to
pick
this
up
again
d
a
good
goto
barley
wine
not
too
strong
good
for
a
session
barley
wine
this
is
a
dangerous
beer
it
goes
down
like
dessert
with
no
indication
of
the
punch
it
packs
d
pretty
decent
bw
not
the
best
ive
had
but
this
is
a
fun
one
worth
checking
out
for
sure
im
gonna
but
some
more
to
toss
in
the
cellar
for
sure
and
some
just
to
enjoy
in
the
bigfoot
offseason
d
i
like
my
barleywines
to
be
a
little
more
malty
and
a
little
less
hoppy
than
what
this
one
was
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
though
14
finger
head
very
quick
dissipation
with
minimal
lacing
cloudy
reddish
amber
body
with
no
visible
carbonation
caramel
malts
dominate
the
nose
this
beer
smells
sweet
but
a
good
floral
hop
presence
taste
is
malt
forward
though
not
as
sweet
as
many
other
barleywines
ive
had
and
there
is
a
good
solid
dose
of
hops
to
countervail
the
sweet
notes
mouthfeel
though
a
bit
sticky
is
pretty
thin
for
the
style
more
drinkable
than
most
beers
of
this
style
given
the
lower
than
average
abv
not
my
favorite
avery
product
but
worth
a
try
for
fans
of
the
style
this
beer
very
good
it
look
red
or
orange
it
smell
very
sweet
and
many
hops
i
like
caramel
sweetness
taste
in
this
beer
it
strong
but
can
be
more
strong
cannot
wait
for
next
bottle
of
avery
it
will
be
india
pale
ale
drinkability
strong
alcohol
makes
it
about
one
and
done
and
if
the
drinker
isnt
into
bitter
taste
this
could
be
a
struggle
d
not
a
bad
barleywine
i
thought
the
smell
was
very
nicely
balanced
between
citrus
hops
and
sweet
malts
but
that
even
with
a
few
months
on
it
the
hops
dominated
the
taste
worth
a
try
and
id
have
again
but
next
time
i
might
just
cellar
a
bottle
and
see
what
happens
in
12
years
d
very
drinkable
barleywine
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
hops
make
this
one
a
great
brew
for
a
hophead
will
get
this
one
again
ive
been
on
a
barleywine
kick
lately
and
this
one
may
have
killed
it
d
i
rated
this
beer
as
a
non
session
beer
and
that
is
why
it
received
the
score
it
did
was
because
of
the
body
the
feel
didnt
ruin
the
beer
for
me
but
it
was
a
bit
of
a
shocker
a
very
respectable
beer
and
from
a
stellar
brewery
d
kind
of
like
a
maltier
bigfoot
this
is
one
of
the
classic
american
examples
for
sure
well
balanced
for
what
it
is
i
had
a
jw
lees
earlier
in
the
day
and
this
is
like
comparing
apples
to
oranges
i
can
clearly
see
the
difference
but
i
already
knew
it
these
are
2
completely
different
styles
i
would
love
to
see
this
age
this
is
a
conclusion
you
would
want
in
any
barleywine
ive
had
a
ton
of
avery
brews
over
the
years
and
ive
met
mr
adam
avery
himself
they
consistently
make
outstanding
beer
and
thanks
for
a
co
brewery
actually
being
in
ca
im
talking
to
you
great
divide
this
is
american
barleywine
clearly
have
a
pint
of
this
and
youll
know
the
style
pours

with

what
i
wanted

i
dont
think
this
was
accurate
but
being
a
imperial
ipa
fan
i
love
this
brew
this
is
truely
a
hop
bomb
d
decent
the
alcohol
hinders
it
however
3
0
t
woa
hefty
smokey
bitter
taste
thick
full
body
more
intense
than
flavorful
not
much
upfront
then
dark
potent
leather
and
finishes
with
a
long
lingering
bitterness
not
a
very
pleasant
bitterness
either
pours
a
hazy
copper
orange
color
with
a
thin
off
white
creamy
head
mildly
strong
citrus
hop
aroma
that
smells
a
tough
tart
the
flavor
has
a
smooth
malty
background
with
well
balanced
citrus
and
earthy
hop
bitterness
it
has
a
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
semisweet
as
the
hop
flavor
dissipates
and
a
subtle
warming
sensation
grows
and
lingers
for
a
while
after
the
end
the
lower
at
least
i
consider
9
2
lower
for
the
style
helps
keep
drinkability
up
and
the
flavor
doesnt
get
boring
overall
impression
probably
a
good
candidate
for
cellaring
and
i
may
pick
up
a
few
bottles
to
experiment
but
damned
tasty
in
all
its
hoppy
glory
right
now
my
guess
is
this
may
be
kinda
like
bigfoot
great
fresh
very
nice
after
a
few
but
awkward
in
between
what
i
love
about
avery
is
that
they
arent
afraid
to
throw
a
few
extra
hops
into
the
kettle
drinkabilitya
little
goes
a
long
way
another
wonderful
brew
from
avery
is
this
is
barleywine
or
a
dipa
or
some
combo
d
i
could
go
for
another
one
for
sure
however
i
dont
think
i
would
do
more
then
two
i
would
really
suggest
this
one
if
you
havent
given
it
a
shot
gtreid
said
hes
been
aging
one
for
three
years
im
looking
forward
to
comparing
the
two
this
has
lost
something
without
gaining
much
aside
from
smoothness
and
decreased
alcohol
presence
the
hoppiness
of
this
very
good
fresh
hoppy
barleywine
has
predictably
faded
but
retains
its
herbal
woody
character
to
some
degree
the
maltiness
has
not
come
up
to
meet
the
hops
deficit
in
any
way
it
is
a
bit
thin
and
mealy
with
no
real
complexity
the
alcohol
burn
has
decreased
and
because
of
the
blandness
it
is
smoother
a
year
hasnt
helped
this
very
good
fresh
brew
at
all
i
plan
to
try
it
fresh
at
6
months
down
the
road
or
at
2
years
golden
red
color
with
a
medium
off
white
head
on
it
seems
like
the
head
has
retained
itself
for
a
good
amount
of
time
the
first
scent
i
pick
up
is
sweet
citrus
followed
by
a
balanced
malt
and
caramel
it
smells
quite
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
a
typical
barley
wine
the
first
thing
i
taste
is
the
sweetness
from
the
malt
and
then
comes
the
pine
and
citrus
i
really
enjoyed
the
transition
from
sweet
to
bitter
in
this
beer
just
when
you
think
sweet
barley
wine
you
get
hit
with
hops
at
the
end
its
very
drinkable
and
smooth
id
pick
it
up
again
just
for
the
sheer
fact
that
i
like
the
hoppy
goodness
that
you
dont
usually
get
with
a
typical
barley
wine
an
excellent
yankee
barleywine
but
thats
the
hophead
in
me
talking
100
ibus
ftw
this
is
very
much
more
akin
to
a
big
dipa
an
example
of
the
blurring
in
practice
of
the
two
theoretically
distinct
styles
drinkability
i
really
like
this
beer
i
think
ill
buy
another
and
put
some
serious
age
on
it
really
tasty
hoppy
american
bw
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
remarkably
well
the
only
draw
back
i
find
is
the
slightly
over
the
top
caramel
malt
fresher
bottles
would
probably
suit
my
taste
better
none
the
less
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
i
would
pick
this
up
again
though
is
not
the
first
i
would
go
to
d
very
drinkable
averys
big
beers
tend
to
taste
similar
to
me
and
i
am
a
fan
hog
heaven
is
no
exception
not
the
very
best
barleywine
but
this
is
a
very
good
beer
this
beer
is
truly
dominated
by
hops
much
more
in
the
typical
american
dipa
style
than
in
a
barley
wine
that
does
not
make
it
a
worse
beer
rather
one
of
the
better
imho
d
i
would
not
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
does
not
appreciate
hops
this
is
really
more
like
a
dipa
than
a
barleywine
i
still
had
the
tingly
numb
feeling
on
my
tongue
an
hour
after
i
finished
the
glass
it
tastes
good
but
one
is
enough
because
it
is
so
assertive
and
boozy
for
example
after
the
bartender
tasted
it
she
puckered
her
face
and
wiped
her
lips
with
the
back
of
her
hand
thats
the
kind
of
involuntary
response
it
generates
many
thanks
to
avery
on
colorado
for
this
materpiece
a
definiate
pick
up
if
you
havent
tried
yet
d
i
would
not
buy
this
over
other
barleywines
such
as
gds
old
ruffian
or
anchors
old
foghorn
freakin
bottle
exploded
all
overy
my
girlfriends
desk
at
least
it
smells
good
poured
out
from
an
exploding
bottle
a
pretty
dark
brown
with
a
murky
appearance
the
head
forms
and
retains
at
about
two
fingers
for
a
good
amount
of
time
pretty
thick
lacing
already
starts
to
form
at
the
top
of
the
glass
around
the
creamy
head
as
the
bottle
exploded
i
already
started
to
get
hints
of
a
massive
sweet
malt
backbone
and
huge
hops
the
malts
smell
of
the
amber
sort
with
a
sweetness
that
may
be
a
bit
over
done
the
hops
are
mostly
piney
but
also
somewhat
earthy
the
malts
are
certainly
the
dominant
factor
in
this
nose
i
would
like
it
to
be
a
tiny
bit
less
sweet
though
the
strength
of
the
nose
is
something
that
brews
should
follow
after
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
massive
amount
of
amber
malt
and
sweetness
the
sweets
are
the
only
thing
i
dont
like
if
it
was
toned
down
this
beer
would
be
world
class
the
piney
and
earthy
hops
help
balance
out
the
flavor
and
add
a
nice
aspect
to
the
beer
there
are
also
some
fruity
flavors
in
the
taste
fruit
peels
as
well
the
flavor
is
big
like
a
barleywine
and
lacks
an
alcohol
bite
at
9
2
that
is
pretty
impresive
mouthfeel
has
a
pretty
thick
creamy
body
with
carbonation
that
is
a
bit
low
but
suits
the
flavor
there
is
a
moderate
amount
of
warming
which
is
nice
in
this
type
of
beer
the
hops
leave
a
huge
coat
of
flavor
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
alright
here
the
price
is
decent
the
taste
is
good
but
the
sweetness
starts
to
take
over
the
beer
toward
the
end
of
my
bomber
good
example
of
a
barleywine
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
on
tap
some
time
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
in
the
mouth
making
it
very
drinkable
a
grand
and
hoppy
beer
but
the
salt
disturbed
me
a
bit
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
considering
that
it
is
a
barley
wine
i
think
maybe
2
or
3
years
is
best
for
this
one
as
it
seems
to
have
lost
a
lot
of
its
character
still
really
enjoyed
it
and
glad
to
have
a
chance
to
try
it
d
low
not
my
fave
style
definitely
needs
some
getting
used
to
poured
into
a
tumbler
it
produced
a
half
inch
tan
head
that
leaves
ample
lacing
the
appearance
is
brown
and
cloudy
the
aroma
is
of
malt
with
a
little
floral
hop
the
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
with
moderate
bitterness
there
is
a
mild
alcohol
heat
and
the
alcohol
blends
well
with
the
taste
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
clean
finish
its
a
very
enjoyable
ale
drinkability
due
to
the
metallic
flavor
was
lowered
but
not
a
bad
bw
as
the
beer
warms
some
of
the
metal
fades
making
it
more
drinkable
overall
it
is
a
good
sipping
beer
especially
on
a
cold
day
like
today
but
its
not
as
interesting
as
some
other
barleywines
ive
had
it
is
really
not
far
from
being
a
double
ipa
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
dthis
is
relatively
well
balanced
but
shows
a
lot
of
alcohol
and
brings
a
little
bite
that
takes
away
from
the
overall
drinkability
overall
wow
this
was
a
good
brew
very
drinkable
quite
smooth
with
a
big
hop
personality
that
balances
the
huge
malt
core
too
drinkable
when
cold
as
it
goes
down
with
the
crisp
refreshing
feel
of
an
ipa
still
goes
down
easy
when
warm
the
well
integrated
abv
makes
this
one
dangerous
i
actually
had
a
bottle
of
this
at
publick
house
in
brookline
that
had
been
aged
a
few
years
which
cost
less
than
what
i
paid
for
a
new
bottle
at
my
local
liquor
store
and
it
was
excellent
the
marriage
of
malt
and
hops
was
perfected
right
from
the
first
sip
instead
of
taking
awhile
as
did
the
one
reviewed
here
and
the
taste
hit
an
amazing
depth
if
you
like
a
good
deep
barley
wine
id
definitely
suggest
putting
a
few
bottles
of
hog
heaven
away
because
it
only
improves
with
age
md
sharp
and
crisp
sort
of
feels
like
an
artifical
drink
after
half
a
glass
this
beer
is
not
for
me
d
one
of
my
favorite
barley
wines
very
nice
with
a
couple
years
on
it
the
columbus
hops
almost
make
you
think
youre
drinking
an
ipa
if
youre
not
careful
pours
amber
to
a
light
brown
with
a
nice
white
head
that
laces
beautifully
through
out
the
glass
smells
of
pine
lemons
orange
peels
and
other
assorted
fruits
taste
is
overly
strong
and
bitter
quite
boozy
heavy
on
the
grapefruit
and
pineapple
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
vanilla
pinetrees
and
some
pear
it
finishes
very
strong
and
bitter
easily
can
see
how
certain
people
would
be
turned
off
by
this
beer
or
type
of
beer
but
better
than
average
in
my
opinion
ruby
colour
creamy
beige
head
looks
very
nice
lots
of
lacing
aroma
is
very
hoppy
more
lika
a
dipa
than
a
barley
wine
pine
citrus
lemon
grass
straw
flavour
reminds
me
of
hercules
big
bite
pine
lemon
grapefruit
resting
on
amalt
backbone
this
is
goodmouthfeel
is
smooth
and
sticky
i
would
never
have
pegged
this
for
a
bw
nevertheless
it
is
great
d
nice
well
balanced
powerful
very
obvious
american
floral
hops
a
high
quality
product
agree
with
many
other
reviewers
that
this
is
not
malty
enough
for
an
american
barleywine
more
like
a
dipa
or
iipa
when
the
nearly
10
abv
is
factored
in
hop
structure
is
very
strong
and
while
initially
fluid
it
stagnates
a
bit
in
the
finish
overall
this
was
just
a
good
old
fashioned
american
barleywine
that
did
everything
solidly
well
worth
a
shot
poured
into
a
pint
glass
its
a
great
barleywine
with
surprising
drinkability
dont
drink
this
from
the
bottle
the
caramel
taste
dominates
the
body
covering
the
100
ibus
nicely
its
a
very
heavy
beer
but
if
you
like
hoppy
thick
barleywine
this
is
a
session
ill
buy
it
again
and
again
d
would
probably
get
a
higher
rating
but
the
aftertaste
lingers
a
bit
too
furiously
seems
like
this
could
do
with
a
little
more
malt
to
balance
it
out
still
tastey
if
your
in
the
mood
for
somthing
hoppy
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
barley
wines
on
the
market
very
well
balanced
between
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
and
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
this
beer
has
always
been
one
of
my
gotos
when
i
feel
like
ive
tried
everything
in
the
shop
i
had
the
pleasure
of
sampling
an
oakaged
version
that
was
aged
in
used
opusone
barrels
needless
to
say
it
was
exceptional
dgreat
very
balanced
beer
with
great
character
abv
the
only
thing
keeping
this
from
sessionability
d
not
bad
considering
the
abv
and
malthop
bill
delicious
but
no
old
ruffian
drinkability
the
abv
is
the
only
thing
holding
this
one
back
great
flavor
profile
and
mouthfeel
i
like
it
but
dont
love
it
im
really
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
an
avery
beer
as
ive
heard
alot
about
them
looking
forward
to
their
other
products
drinkability
aged
or
fresh
this
beer
is
great
just
wish
they
put
it
in
6packs
admittedly
full
sails
barleywine
the
2008
vintage
is
almost
as
good
but
much
more
affordable
since
it
is
local
so
it
is
doubtful
i
will
have
this
very
often
but
i
would
readily
grab
another
if
i
had
one
and
didnt
have
to
go
to
work
in
the
morning
overall
an
excellent
and
hallmark
example
of
the
style
and
one
i
would
recommend
to
any
beginner
provided
its
reasonably
fresh
not
sure
of
this
ones
aging
potential
but
ive
got
some
down
there
to
give
it
a
try
definitely
a
great
beer
and
one
that
should
be
an
early
thought
in
classic
american
barleywine
discussions
great
beer
vaguely
hazy
amber
with
ruby
hints
depending
on
the
lighting
really
tight
and
creamy
finger
and
a
half
of
off
white
head
some
larger
particles
also
seen
floating
around
smells
delightful
reminiscent
of
a
dipa
also
get
a
good
deal
of
caramel
and
some
spicy
dark
fruits
definitely
sweet
with
caramel
really
strong
on
the
malt
alcohol
is
pretty
noticeable
im
not
real
experienced
with
barley
wines
as
this
is
only
the
second
ive
sampled
i
thought
the
smell
was
better
than
the
taste
on
this
one
seems
this
is
hop
heavy
for
the
style
from
what
ive
read
which
is
in
my
favor
its
a
good
beer
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
another
at
this
time
anyway
as
my
opinion
goes
its
beautiful
to
look
at
smells
great
but
the
taste
just
doesnt
fit
my
palate
like
id
hoped
notes
pity
this
does
not
cut
it
for
me
as
a
barley
wine
but
most
importantly
it
remains
rather
short
of
a
very
memorable
drinking
experience
if
feels
at
times
closer
to
a
dipa
but
also
failing
at
that
since
that
does
not
seem
its
goal
it
is
not
that
it
needs
to
fit
necessarily
to
a
standard
style
but
the
hoppiness
translates
here
as
bitterness
with
a
fizzy
carbonated
feel
that
lacks
the
roundness
of
a
dipa
and
i
love
what
avery
does
with
its
maharaja
for
instance
and
its
true
that
us
barley
wines
are
typically
far
hoppier
and
maltier
than
their
english
counterparts
but
it
is
not
that
it
is
going
in
that
direction
it
has
little
of
the
complexities
or
some
direction
of
balance
or
promised
sweet
notes
of
a
barley
wine
mind
you
it
remains
a
good
brew
in
that
it
is
not
a
pain
at
all
to
drink
it
but
there
is
plenty
stuff
out
there
that
ill
chose
over
this
one
both
from
avery
and
in
particular
elsewhere
in
terms
of
barley
wines
overall
this
beer
is
a
great
sipper
but
at
9
2
abv
not
the
most
drinkable
i
recommend
this
to
everyone
this
one
really
was
a
pleasant
surprise
from
avery
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
an
even
more
hoppedup
old
guardian
it
pours
a
nice
copper
orange
with
big
pillowy
white
head
it
leaves
big
sticky
lace
it
smells
a
great
deal
like
a
dipabig
citrusy
hops
sticky
resinous
hops
and
a
bit
of
sweet
caramel
the
taste
follows
the
nose
its
like
a
big
caramel
hop
bomb
although
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
malt
bill
to
fit
the
mold
for
most
american
barleywines
ive
had
it
is
very
tasty
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
thick
this
ones
a
great
drink
for
sure
one
of
my
favorites
from
avery
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
lighter
golden
color
along
the
bottom
of
the
glass
13
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
hops
sweet
malt
and
citrus
fits
the
style
of
an
american
barleywine
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
thick
with
a
low
carbonation
level
the
bitterness
level
is
very
high
in
this
brew
tastes
of
slight
roasted
malt
hops
alcohol
sweet
malt
and
slight
citrus
plum
notes
style
example
for
american
barleywine
i
think
this
one
may
be
more
fresh
than
the
previous
time
i
had
this
tastes
and
smells
much
more
like
a
dipa
really
hoppy
the
malt
is
still
there
but
it
is
now
in
the
background
lots
of
citrus
and
pine
still
very
good
but
the
first
time
was
much
better
overall
impression
great
beer
nicely
balanced
cellerable
for
three
years
malt
really
lingers
and
balances
the
hops
well
a
mediumfull
body
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
great
especially
for
an
avery
the
mouthfeel
is
perhaps
the
highlight
of
the
beer
thick
and
smooth
and
wellcarbonated
the
drinkability
is
another
story
22
oz
bottle
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
slight
orange
hue
fair
offwhite
head
and
good
lacing
aroma
is
mainly
malts
very
fruity
raisins
molasses
with
a
decent
amount
of
citrus
hops
for
balance
flavor
is
caramel
tons
of
citrus
hops
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
which
im
sure
will
mellow
with
time
mouthfeel
is
oily
and
very
bitter
very
good
beer
very
hoppy
for
a
barleywine
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
full
the
9
is
very
well
hidden
as
it
is
unnoticeable
this
is
like
a
malty
double
ipa
and
i
love
it
a
great
effort
from
avery
another
avery
beer
that
i
like
a
lot
great
balance
of
hops
and
malt
with
great
american
barleywine
bitterness
color
is
excellent
and
the
aroma
is
also
great
this
is
one
i
will
get
in
any
season
im
always
glad
to
see
avery
on
the
shelves
almost
borders
on
double
ipa
hoppiness
but
does
fit
in
the
category
pours
a
really
nice
copper
with
a
thin
film
on
top
that
doesnt
want
to
go
away
and
laces
thick
on
the
glass
smell
is
typical
hop
aromas
citrusy
piney
grassy
sticky
taste
is
not
too
bitter
and
light
on
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
and
good
drinkability
i
dont
think
this
is
a
barleywine
just
a
high
abv
ipa
cheers
d
being
a
9
2
beer
and
having
100ibus
this
is
a
workout
for
the
tongue
i
cant
really
drink
a
lot
of
it
and
this
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
for
a
barleywine
still
a
good
beer
if
this
beer
were
to
come
from
the
east
coast
no
doubt
about
it
it
would
be
a
dipa
this
is
actually
stronger
than
most
of
the
east
coast
dipas
ive
had
just
simply
from
the
huge
hop
presence
will
probably
grab
another
interesting
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
hop
fix
go
for
this
one
pours
a
very
red
brownish
color
with
a
slight
finger
of
head
the
aroma
is
colombus
hops
with
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
the
bottle
claims
2
5
lbs
of
colombus
hops
per
barrel
and
this
is
readily
evident
drinks
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
barleywine
this
is
a
very
hopforward
beer
more
of
a
iipa
than
a
barleywine
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
in
the
future
i
will
just
be
prepared
for
it
to
not
taste
like
a
barleywine
at
all
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
although
there
are
better
abws
out
there
this
is
a
good
highoctane
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
pours
a
deep
redamber
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
smells
of
sweet
syrupy
malts
pineapple
butterscotch
and
a
little
alcohol
are
perceived
in
the
nose
very
rich
sweet
taste
as
expected
tastes
of
molasses
apples
pears
and
a
mild
grassy
hops
flavor
some
chocolate
there
in
the
back
mouthfeel
is
moderate
to
full
and
the
beer
leaves
a
coating
behind
after
each
swallow
at
9
2
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
making
this
beer
quite
drinkable
ill
be
finishing
this
bomber
no
problem
the
hops
have
mellowed
out
a
bit
with
age
but
this
is
still
a
darn
good
barleywine
drinkability
all
around
an
easy
beer
to
drink
the
sour
apple
taste
is
pretty
unique
im
still
looking
for
that
barleywine
that
can
top
lagunitas
bottle
pours
a
hazy
light
brown
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
apple
skins
light
fruits
and
light
citrus
hops
flavor
of
sweet
malt
lemon
iced
tea
some
sweet
grassy
hops
in
the
finish
heavy
palate
huge
malt
bomb
here
hmm
i
wasnt
really
impressed
by
this
beer
taste
is
light
grapefruit
pear
apple
on
the
first
sip
then
bitter
alcohol
some
lemon
some
tangerine
and
a
little
caramel
ends
a
little
dry
and
very
bitter
decent
barleywine
definitely
on
the
bitter
end
of
the
spectrum
for
the
style
at
least
overall
this
beer
seems
like
a
double
ipa
it
is
malty
but
what
really
takes
the
beer
over
is
the
colombus
dry
hops
100
ibus
i
am
a
hophead
though
and
from
arkansas
so
i
love
it
i
do
however
believe
that
the
9
2
abv
and
astringent
characteristics
would
hinder
it
from
being
a
good
session
beer
appearance
is
fine
you
know
ambercopper
you
might
expect
with
standard
headlacing
a
little
weak
but
not
bad
just
finished
up
a
dipa
and
i
really
feel
like
this
might
fall
in
the
same
category
big
hoppy
flavor
with
a
nice
toffee
malt
presence
but
this
one
is
not
a
malt
w
hop
presence
but
definitely
the
vice
versa
it
is
nonetheless
really
tasty
a
kind
of
standard
nice
fruity
caramelly
hopmalt
thats
nicely
delicious
a
nice
brew
not
the
greatest
american
barley
wine
ive
had
but
a
nice
entry
more
impressive
than
it
seems
at
first
this
is
a
fine
barley
wine
worthy
of
frequent
imbibing
not
overthetop
but
accessibly
drinkable
and
perpetually
smooth
avery
stays
on
par
with
this
one
i
could
sip
on
this
for
awhilereally
a
nice
barleywine
i
had
it
with
some
bacon
pizzait
is
a
nice
pairing
d
kind
of
an
eh
barleywine
this
reminded
me
a
lot
of
old
horizontal
so
im
giving
it
the
same
rating
dark
reddish
nice
cap
of
foam
on
top
smells
like
a
malty
sugary
fruit
bomb
the
beer
is
way
too
sweet
for
me
cloyingly
sweet
i
dont
find
a
lot
of
balance
offered
here
by
the
hops
to
cut
some
of
the
sweetness
as
a
side
note
ironicaly
i
was
watching
a
special
about
monster
wild
hogs
on
the
discovery
channel
while
i
drank
this
lol
d
i
am
surprised
i
got
through
the
whole
22
oz
bottle
on
my
own
then
again
i
have
yet
to
find
a
barleywine
that
leaves
me
wanting
a
second
serving
type
bottle
beer
poured
into
my
rochefort
chalice
is
burnt
orange
in
color
and
forms
a
2
finger
head
that
dies
after
a
couple
minutes
nose
is
great
and
is
dominated
by
malt
and
caramel
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
but
the
beer
is
balanced
well
by
the
right
amount
of
hops
definitely
some
sweetness
to
this
bw
but
its
not
over
powering
and
it
makes
it
quite
drinkable
the
abv
is
hidden
really
well
considering
the
strength
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
poured
into
westmalle
chalace
burnt
orange
hsss
with
a
nice
thin
white
head
that
stayed
there
long
enough
good
lacing
smells
very
fruity
with
nice
hints
of
the
malted
sweets
no
apparent
alcohol
smell
to
it
which
is
nice
for
9
2
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
fruit
notes
but
it
just
isnt
as
strong
a
flavor
as
id
like
in
a
barleywine
mouthfeel
is
excellent
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
slight
hint
of
alcohol
this
is
a
very
drinkable
barleywine
im
not
sure
how
old
my
bottle
was
but
the
label
looked
fairly
aged
around
the
edges
faded
and
slighty
roughed
up
corners
itd
be
a
waste
to
pair
with
food
have
this
one
to
sip
after
the
meal
mouthfeel
is
great
but
i
think
it
could
benefit
from
just
a
touch
more
carbonation
this
is
also
one
of
the
most
drinkable
barleywines
ive
ever
had
the
luscious
malt
character
really
makes
you
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
drinkability
it
was
easier
to
drink
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
for
a
barely
wine
it
is
very
drinkable
it
doesnt
have
any
cement
gut
feel
too
it
and
the
absence
of
sweetness
doesnt
get
you
sick
of
it
quickly
if
your
tongue
can
handle
the
bitters
and
your
liver
the
high
alcohol
content
you
could
put
down
a
few
of
these
i
had
this
a
couple
of
days
ago
and
half
way
through
had
to
stop
drinking
after
my
daughter
starting
puking
on
her
first
taste
of
guacamole
i
will
do
a
follow
up
review
drinkability
im
really
enjoying
drinking
this
beer
10
along
with
the
creaminess
i
would
have
to
say
its
not
highly
drinkable
it
is
however
a
very
delicious
and
great
looking
beer
a
good
english
style
bwine
overall
this
is
only
a
sipping
beer
as
the
9
2
kicks
pretty
good
let
it
warm
up
and
split
it
with
a
friend
or
2
its
a
shame
it
tastes
as
strong
as
it
is
as
you
can
taste
a
good
beer
tring
to
poking
through
mouthfeeldrinkability
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
the
alcohol
is
not
powerful
for
being
9
2
abv
carbonation
is
really
not
noticable
m
d
a
smooth
shimmer
of
carbonation
not
too
asserive
but
not
all
too
mellow
as
barleywines
go
this
is
remarkably
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
sipper
for
alcohol
content
alone
its
well
hidden
and
goes
down
quite
nicely
smooth
though
slightly
thinner
than
expected
mild
resins
in
the
finish
moderate
very
fine
and
delicate
carbonation
is
almost
fluffy
beer
poured
amber
red
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
is
leaving
lacing
behind
nose
is
sweet
and
of
floral
hops
taste
is
pretty
well
balanced
malts
are
plentiful
and
sweet
blending
nicely
with
a
northwest
hops
mouthfeel
makes
this
beer
as
it
is
full
bodied
and
pretty
darn
smooth
overall
drinkability
is
better
than
expected
as
the
hops
are
not
off
the
chart
like
fresh
barleywines
are
makes
me
wonder
how
long
this
was
sitting
when
purchased
this
is
quite
enjoyable
and
recommended
to
try
this
beer
is
much
more
balanced
but
still
hop
forward
the
cranberry
red
beer
has
a
small
off
white
head
that
doesnt
cling
hops
and
citrus
in
the
nose
with
caramel
and
sweetness
in
the
background
all
of
that
is
echoed
in
the
taste
thin
carbonation
and
the
presence
of
alcohol
burns
the
mouth
but
it
is
rather
pleasant
two
of
these
would
waste
you
though
not
incredibly
drinkable
good
beer
overall
though
i
enjoyed
this
offering
from
avery
its
definitely
a
nice
contrast
to
something
like
the
bigfoot
oelergud
because
of
the
taste
and
the
high
alcohol
that
is
a
bit
hot
this
beer
gets
merely
an
average
for
drinkability
i
might
buy
again
to
age
i
just
dont
want
to
lose
all
the
lovely
hops
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
barleywine
and
dangerously
drinkable
taste
is
solid
and
strong
like
a
barleywine
should
be
a
lot
of
malt
and
a
lot
of
hops
i
like
it
but
i
have
to
say
that
ive
had
better
ex
bigfoot
backburner
drinks
easy
and
is
quite
oily
in
the
mouth
solid
overall
and
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
mdnice
medium
body
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
not
an
overly
compex
barleywine
but
very
good
easy
to
drink
and
something
im
glad
i
can
get
on
a
regular
basis
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
with
an
off
white
head
that
fades
fast
but
leaves
lacing
the
smell
is
very
sweet
with
some
subtle
hop
notes
the
taste
is
sweet
with
some
nice
malt
finishes
with
a
strong
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
not
a
very
power
abv
feel
for
such
a
high
content
this
is
a
nice
drinker
not
too
overpowering
very
enjoyable
a
great
barleywine
worth
checking
out
at
times
this
brew
can
be
dangerously
drinkable
because
the
alcohol
sits
in
the
back
undetected
not
quite
what
i
expected
from
one
of
my
favorite
colorado
brewers
a
barleywine
with
the
emphasis
on
the
american
i
like
it
though
i
wish
the
malt
was
a
little
larger
to
help
with
some
of
the
bitter
bite
oh
also
some
decent
alcohol
warming
in
the
mouth
and
chest
with
this
dat
times
this
seemed
to
be
an
easydrinking
barleywine
but
then
id
sense
the
immense
bitterness
of
this
brew
and
realize
that
its
a
wallop
of
a
beer
enjoyable
to
drink
id
love
it
again
but
wow
is
it
big
overall
i
really
enjoyed
all
the
hops
in
this
barlywine
the
appearance
was
great
and
it
had
an
awesome
overall
taste
highly
recommended
it
might
not
be
the
best
barleywine
but
if
you
love
candied
fruits
and
the
thought
of
caramellathered
citrus
than
invest
in
a
bottle
of
averys
hog
heaven
if
not
to
have
now
then
to
have
any
time
in
the
next
3
years
its
lifespan
according
to
the
brewery
for
when
the
mood
strikes
im
glad
it
struck
me
tonight
and
im
even
more
happy
ive
still
got
half
a
bottle
left
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
i
just
cant
get
past
the
taste
so
the
drinkability
is
low
i
hope
for
the
sake
of
averys
reputation
in
my
eyes
that
this
one
improves
with
age
perhaps
i
got
a
young
one
but
ive
personally
brewed
a
better
barleywine
than
this
disappointing
cheers
d
theres
no
way
i
was
going
to
down
a
bomber
of
this
in
one
sitting
after
reading
the
thread
on
recapping
beer
i
popped
a
stopper
in
this
stuck
it
in
the
fridge
and
am
hoping
for
the
best
overall
this
beer
felt
a
little
young
and
rough
i
think
getting
a
bottle
to
cellar
is
in
order
very
good
brew
pours
dark
amber
with
a
nice
thick
beige

aroma

completely
hop
forward
in
a
good
way
there
are
also
some
caramel
and
slightly
spicy

sweet
doughy
flavors
are
outshined
by
the
citrus
and
pine
hops
almost
an
east

dipa
really
even
has
a
nice
bitterness
on
the
finish
great
chewy
body
with
high
drinkability
drink
asides
from
the
abv
and
hops
mildly
drinkable
overall
i
can
see
why
people
claim
that
this
could
be
a
dipa
its
very
strongly
hopped
and
quite
bitter
deep
billowing
bubbles
below
the
surface
during
the
pour

into
a
frothy

huge
bubbles
and
lots
of

copper

as

it

not

one

ive
ever
had
sweet
and
smooth
all
the
way
around
this
beer
is
great
with
fried
chicken
or
something
sweet
definitely
one
of
my
more
favorite
from
the
people
at
avery
this
beer
was
available
at
barneys
beanery
in
santa
monica
the
service
from
the
waitresses
was
horrible
the
waitresses
although
cute
were
lacking
in
most
if
not
any
beer
knowledge
and
were
equally
incompetent
when
it
came
to
food
services
very
good
offering
from
avery
thanks
for
reading
it
has
rich
very
deep
copperbronze
body
this
beers
head
is
average
height
and
has
a
golden
color
it
has
a
malty
aroma
at
first
but
has
it
sit
it
becomes
more
hoppy
and
floral
it
has
a
wonderful
lace
that
sticks
around
forever
it
has
a
bitter
fruity
taste
with
some
tar
like
tones
you
definitely
get
some
of
the
bitterness
from
the
100
ibus
it
has
a
pollen
and
grapefruit
style
of
bitterness
it
gives
off
some
alcohol
warmth
but
not
much
it
has
average
carbonation
to
the
mouthfeel
it
is
not
as
heavy
in
the
body
as
many
might
think
i
would
go
the
higher
end
of
medium
overall
i
know
that
barley
wine
should
be
bitter
but
the
was
something
in
the
bitterness
i
did
not
care
for
overall
great
complex
barleywine
i
tried
last
years
hog
heaven
but
it
was
a
while
ago
and
i
accidentally
let
it
get
too
cold
i
liked
it
but
i
figured
i
shouldnt
review
off
of
that
experience
in
summary
i
recommend
this
beer
for
both
barleywine
lovers
and
hopheads
alike
theres
something
in
this
brew
for
everyone
to
experience
d
one
22oz
bottle
is
about
right
but
could
easily
be
shared
this
beer
is
so
tasty
though
that
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
delicious
d
too
thick
to
be
really
drinkable
and
will
love
to
see
what
the
bottle
i
stuck
in
the
cellar
tastes
like
in
a
year
or
two
a
great
barleywine
love
this
one
notes
what
a
fine
american
barleywine
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
is
one
that
deserves
much
more
credit
than
it
receives
if
you
like
barleywines
then
do
yourself
a
favor
and
make
it
a
point
to
pick
some
up
chances
are
you
too
will
be
in
hog
heaven
beer
pours
a
sightly
caramel
color
with
decent
cap
of
foam
the
aroma
is
sweet
bready
malt
with
hops
definitely
making
their
presence
know
slightly
carbonated
on
the
palate
with
a
solid
medium
body
more
sweet
malt
and
a
little
breadiness
on
the
palate
but
a
pleasing
hop
bitterness
pervades
it
all
finishes
light
and
fast
a
hoppy
barleywine
that
is
not
too
sweet
one
of
the
more
drinkable
examples
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
the
lord
bless
the
hop
harvest
drinkability
for
a
barleywine
not
half
bad
as
the
alcohol
has
really
completed
melded
with
this
one
its
truly
hardly
detectable
at
all
and
though
this
one
has
a
decent
amount
of
fruity
and
malty
overtones
itd
make
a
good
english
barleywine
almost
there
are
a
lot
of
hop
skeletons
here
too
pours
a
darkamber
color
that
is
so
dense
it
makes
this
beer
seem
hazy
even
though
i
know
it
is
not
it
has
a
nice
offwhite
head
which
i
expected
spicy
dark
malt
and
alcohol
are
the
most
prevalent
in
the
nose
hog
heaven
really
reaffirms
to
me
that
i
can
compare
barleywines
to
the
really
stinky
awesome
cheese
of
the
beer
world
the
taste
is
also
of
malt
and
alcohol
but
not
in
a
burning
way
more
subtle
warming
pretty
awesome
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
slightly
creamy
awesome
beer
not
the
best
barleywine
but
no
doubt
very
noteworthy
and
worth
getting
if
you
come
across
it
overall
what
else
is
there
to
say
to
rate
this
anything
but
an
a
is
audacious
this
beer
honestly
couldnt
get
any
better
but
will
stay
at
4
5s
for
the
hope
that
maybe
something
else
out
there
is
better
quite
the
challenge
go
buy
it
now
youll
thank
me
later
mmmhmmm
taste
roasted

overall
this
a

hoppy
american
barley
wine
i
feel
that
with
a
good
couple
of
years
of
aging
this
beer
would
mellow
out
and
make
a
beautiful
well
rounded
barley
wine
the
beer
balances
out
and
is

barleywine
caramelbrown

with
a
strong

taste
is
obviously
hoppy
with
a
heaping
of
resin
and
grapefruit
but
also
has
solid
malt
and
earthy
tastes
almost
a
woody
character
comes
through
a
bitter
barleywine
and
a
very
good
one
love
it
ive
had
this
a
number
of
times
and
each
time
i
have
it
i
cant
believe
i
dont
drink
it
more
often
its
easily
in
my
top
3
of
barley
wines
and
definitely
in
my
top
10
of
beers
and
at
5bomber
its
an
incredible
value
as
expected
seems
to
be
a
hybrid

style
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amberorange
color
producing
a
fluffy
thick
white

foam
fades
out
quite
a
bit
leaving
a
thin
coating
of
swirly
islands
with
some
spotty
lacing
nose
shows
off
tons
of
citrus
rind
and
piney
hops
with
some
caramel
and
toffee
notes
waffing
in

background
very
ipa
like
in
the
aroma
department
here
palate
is
full
slick
and
creamy
with
a
fine
carbonation
fizz
flavors
are
pretty
well
balanced
between
the
malts
and
hops
for
a
western
us
bw
the
hoppy
citrus
and
pine
flavors
do
dominate
but
there
is
a
nice
sweet
malty
contribution
with
tastes
of
melted
caramels
toffee
and
roasted
malts
a
decent
level
of
warming
alcohol
comes
in
at
the
finish
to
let
you
know
youre
drinking
a
hefty
brew
good
stuff
but
considering
the
7
49
price
not
a
great
value
drinkability
i
was
surprised
by
how
drinkable
this
is
much
more
so
than
others
of
this
style
that
said
it
seems
more
ipa
than
barleywine
still
very
good
though
i
will
have
to
get
another
this
is
anything
but
a
standard
barley
wine
what
you
notice
right
away
is
that
this
beer
is
strong
without
knocking
your
socks
off
the
aroma
has
more
in
common
with
an
ipa
than
a
barley
wine
now
barley
wine
purest
will
scoff
but
i
am
actually
a
huge
ipa
fan
so
this
is
a
welcome
change
there
is
pine
like
resin
hops
and
some
grapefruit
to
go
along
with
the
sweet
caramel
malt
yeast
and
alcohol
the
appearance
is
great
with
a
three
and
a
half
finger
head
also
not
common
for
the
style
and
deep
amber
color
the
flavor
is
just
like
the
aroma
its
not
complex
but
its
tasty
the
palate
is
sticky
and
smooth
like
one
would
expect
for
the
style
the
aftertaste
is
astringently
bitter
with
some
butterscotch
overall
i
think
this
is
an
awesome
interpretation
of
a
barley
wine
but
its
not
a
standard
of
the
style
insanely
hopped
barleywine
what
a
wonderful
concept
for
this
style
nice
bitterly
hopped
aroma
over
a
well
malted
backbone
vibrant
dark
copper
pour
with
some
amber
coloring
huge
off
white
head
eventually
settling
to
a
half
inch
and
tons
of
thick
lacing
strong
steady
carbonation
perfection
for
this
strong
style
considering
lasting
head
on
a
barleywine
is
a
rare
happening
filling
juicy
mouthfeel
nice
easy
bitter
finish
makes
you
wanting
more
amazing
flavor
very
hoppy
resembling
a
well
crafted
ipa
that
gets
over
on
a
rather
sweet
malt
content
there
were
a
couple
times
where
the
sweet
alcohol
burn
showed
itself
but
it
was
soon
covered
up
by
that
well
balanced
hop
flavor
really
a
fantastic
brew
all
in
all
the
thing
i
was
probably
the
most
disappointed
in
was
the
lack
of
complexity
it
really
tasted
like
there
ipa
but
just
boosted
the
gravity
and
in
fact
i
love
there
ipa
and
really
wasnt
loving
this
brew
oh
well
poured
a
deep
rich
inviting
clear
copper
color
with
a
thick
near
white
head
aroma
has
the
floralpiney
hops
as
well
as
a
hint
of
malt
while
still
cold
no
alcohol
was
present
in
the
aroma
taste
is
an
excellent
chewy
balance
between
malt
sweetness
and
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
at
this
point
second
sip
seems
very
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
not
much
alcohol
detected
a
really
nice
beer
a
colored
like
an
iced
tea
nice
patches
of
thick
froth
that
lingered
for
a
good
time
after
the
initial
pour
a
steady
stream
of
miniscule

t
i
sample
barley
wines
somewhat
infrequently
due

taste
preferences

a

months

i
had
a
sample
of
hog
heaven
at
a
brickskeller
tasting
with
adam
avery
in
dc
and
i
was
blown
away
for
a
barley
wine
this
is
extremely
drinkable
its
not
the
utopia
i
recall
from
the
tasting
but
this
is
still
a

feared
this
beer

i

not

fan
but
it
proved
to
be

none

beer
for
late

would
be

acidic
bitter
aftertaste
i
dont
think
i
enjoy
barleywines
i
have
held
off
on
buying
bottles
of
this
forever
so
i
am
glad
i
got
to
sample
it
a
few
times
cannot
believe
that
of
averys
19
beers
11
of
them
are
over
8
abv
this
is
definitely
one
of
them
but
i
think
this
one
will
improve
more
with
age
than
a
lot
of
the
others
this
is
a
decent
barleywine
from
the
colorado
brewery
i
might
drink
it
again
worth
trying
pours
a
golden
tan
with
a
fluffy
almost
white
head
smells
like
hops
and
malt
in
vast
quantities
i
am
currently
excited
for
my
first
sip
its
smooth
and
rich
sweet
and
hoppy
this
has
to
be
my
favorite
barleywine
not
too
sweet
not
too
dry
its
chewy
and
smooth
and
goes
down
quick
i
can
see
this
becoming
a
favorite
beer
got
this
beer
at
market
of
choice
in
ashland
or
this
is
is
a
great
brew
that
pours
a
rich
light
mahogony
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
partly
cloudy
head
the
smell
is
sweet
and
spice
the
flavor
follows
the
smell
with
a
prominent
floral
sweetness
resembling
sherry
and
burbon
and
an
excellent
hoppiness
it
carries
a
rich
semithick
body
without
being
syrupy
and
the
carbonation
is
just
enough
to
balance
the
thick
ale
qualities
highly
drinkable
great
barleywine
i
like
most
of
avery
though
so
i
might
be
biased
it
seems
to
have
more
of
a
hops
flavor
than
most
barleywines
of
course
the
malt
dominates
the
taste
but
the
hops
does
creat
a
nice
balance
and
a
sharp
initial
taste
with
a
smooth
long
run
mouthfeel
i
will
drink
this
again
clean
mouthfeel
with
bite
from
bitterness
this
is
quite
a
drinkable
bottle
of
beer
if
i
wanted
a
barleywine
though
i
might
reach
for
something
else
before
this
one
this
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
the
sweetness
sets
it
apart
from
what
would
otherwise
be
a
highalpha
ipa
but
its
a
very
complementary
sweetness
which
goes
well
with
the
hop
character
i
found
myself
enjoying
this
one
a
fair
bit
this
brew
poured
a
beautiful
translucent
dark
reddish
brown
nice
head
and
bursting
with
hop
fragrance
i
know
barleywines
are
supposed
to
be
strong
and
this
one
definitely
was
after
the
hop
punch
subsided
there
was
a
strong
boozy
presence
that
stayed
on
the
palate
for
quite
a
while
not
a
bad
brew
considering
the
excellent
smell
and
relatively
pleasing
taste
but
definitely
a
sipper
not
based
on
abv
but
flavor
in
the
end
a
great
barely
wine
not
your
average
take
on
it
almost
makes
me
think
of
sweetwater
donkey
punch
though
hard
to
say
this
one
is
for
everyone
but
i
like
the
hops
and
found
it
to
be
far
more
drinkable
that
your
average
barely
wine
d
very
pleasant
surprise
when
i
picked
this
one
up
i
wasnt
sure
if
i
wanted
a
barleywine
or
a
dipa
this
was
a
great
compromise
something
ill
be
sure
to
pick
up
again
too
potent
to
have
more
than
one
of
but
its
something
ill
have
pretty
often
pours
a
copper
ruby
hue
no
bubbles
but
a
good
one
and
a
half
finger
head
right
after
the
pour
this
lessens
to
a
film
of
foam
that
almost
covers
the
whole
ale
the
aroma
is
a
hoppy
mint
mixed
with
freshly
milled
and
toasted
caramel
malts
plus
a
black
pepper
aroma
to
boot
the
malts
have
a
mild
touch
of
biscuits
with
some
honey
lingering
amidst
the
overall
hop
bomb
tha
is
this
young
barley
wine
the
palate
is
thick
and
full
bodied
bu
the
ibus
seem
to
overwhelm
the
tast
buds
i
like
young
barley
wines
as
much
as
well
aged
ones
but
this
onewas
a
bit
too
much
for
my
palate
the
aftertaste
lingers
way
too
long
with
the
same
resiny
funky
hop
palate
not
bad
but
a
bit
over
done
with
the
hopping
pours
a
reddish
amber
with
a
bubbly
three
finger
head
that
is
somewhere
in
between
tan
and
a
light
brownit
does
leave
some
big
patchy
lace
as
it
drops
to
a
quarter
inch
cap
the
nose
is
sweet
with
citrus
tendencies
and
overall
very
hoppy
and
caramely
sweeti
hope
this
taste
as
wonderful
as
it
smells
i
am
in
luck
because
this
bad
lil
pig
is
flying
high
very
hoppyyet
just
as
maltyawesome
balancebut
still
leans
to
the
citrusypine
like
hops
that
my
taste
buds
crave
i
also
taste
some
subtle
oak
barrel
flavors
as
well
as
sugary
caramel
the
body
is
full
and
has
a
nice
roughness
to
the
finisha
coarseness
that
adds
depth
and
is
needed
because
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
lingering
sugar
coats
the
pallet
and
if
you
enjoy
a
strong
aftertaste
like
i
doyou
will
get
your
moneys
worth
this
is
some
dank
azz
beer
t
loads
of
hops
flavor
and
extreme
bitterness
very
earthy
medium
to
full
body
with
noticeable
carbonation
i
had
some
trouble
drinking
this
one
overall
a
very
good
brew
from
avery
and
i
can
find
it
a
few
of
the
lq
stores
close
to
my
house
so
it
will
probably
be
a
monthly
choice
for
me
give
this
one
a
try
d
wish
i
had
bought
another
bottle
d
yes
mouthfeel
is
rich
no
annoying
heavy
alcohol
taste
drinkability
is
good
i
had
an
accident
with
the
last
half
of
the
bomber
and
greatly
regretted
having
to
wipe
it
up
rather
than
drink
it
a
very
nice
experience
drinkability
due
to
the
tannins
i
had
to
rate
it
only
a
four
though
i
must
say
i
like
this
beer
and
barleywines
in
general
22
oz
bomber
the
appearance
here
is
a
really
nice
clear
ruby
copper
color
topped
with
a
thick
fluffy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
quite
hoppy
with
some
fruits
and
a
much
less
noticeable
malty
note
big
hoppy
flavor
tangy
sweet
caramel
malts
warming
and
finishes
with
some
candylike
grapefruit
hops
sour
hoppy
aftertaste
overall
i
found
this
to
be
an
excellent
beer
excellent
brew
another
wonderful
treat
from
avery
d
i
have
to
say
this
has
to
be
in
my
top
3
barleywines
i
really
enjoy
the
amount
of
hops
that
avery
put
into
this
brew
really
balances
the
richness
and
sweet
characters
that
i
find
often
overwhelm
a
very
good
beer
this
beer
really
changes
with
age
i
would
say
depending
on
your
taste
for
barley
wine
you
will
either
like
the
older
or
the
newer
the
best
i
think
the
2008
was
the
best
because
of
the
immense
pine
hop
aroma
and
flavor
however
the
2002
bottle
had
a
great
malt
complexity
and
still
have
enough
hops
to
clearly
make
it
a
barley
wine
poured
on
tap
in
an
unibroue
tulip
at
the
flying
saucer
kc
this
beer
pours
a
murky
amber
with
a
big
creamy
white
head
that
left
huge
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
bready
hops
there
is
also
a
big
malty
sweetness
that
comes
through
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
west
coast
hops
grapefruit
and
oranges
then
comes
this
odd
malty
barley
taste
its
the
taste
that
i
really
dont
like
in
barleywines
i
find
it
really
off
putting
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
all
in
all
it
just
seems
like
an
average
barleywinedipa
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
barley
wine
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
its
worth
checking
this
one
out
sometime
drinkability
one
pint
and
i
would
be
good
for
a
night
leaves
a
hops
flavor
on
the
pallet
that
could
overpower
other
beers
so
it
would
be
best
to
end
with
this
one
enjoyed
this
beer
would
love
to
taste
it
after
cellaring
great
beer
for
a
barleywine
it
is
not
too
hard
to
drink
note
this
beer
partners
some
teryaki
beef
jerky
phenomenally
well
drinkability
is
well
its
a
barleywine
my
bomber
is
treating
me
right
but
ill
probably
call
it
good
after
this
one
enjoyable
beer
to
sip
on
a
tremendous
brew
on
par
with
great
divide
sierra
nevada
and
victory
in
the
barleywine
style
d
overall
a
big
hop
intensed
barleywine
style
that
should
be
drunk
and
savored
by
itself
warms
up
nicely
releasing
a
dried
fruit
presence
and
floral
hop
bitterness
that
defines
this
style
d
as
with
most
barleywines
its
a
sipper
one
bomber
is
easily
enough
its
very
close
to
being
a
dipa
but
theres
enough
malty
sweetness
and
alcohol
presence
to
nudge
it
into
barleywine
territory
in
my
opinion
it
also
has
that
difficulttodefine
extra
level
of
aromatic
complexity
you
would
expect
to
find
in
a
barleywine
over
most
dipas
still
i
would
suggest
this
heartily
to
dipa
fans
looking
to
get
their
barleywine
on
the
drink
is
smooth
and
mediumbodied
and
very
drinkable
despite
the
potent
9
2
abv
d
much
better
than
last
years
example
may
need
to
be
reclassified
as
an
imperial
ipa
kinda
missed
on
some
maltiness
md
full
bodied
slightly
creamy
moderate
level
of
carbonation
decent
drinkability
this
is
a
really
good
barley
wine
very
impressed
drinks
like
a
slightly
smaller
beer
but
the
hops
let
you
know
what
you
are
getting
into
the
100
ibus
are
pure
sex
on
my
tounge
great
beer
avery
22
oz
bottle
aroma
is
caramel
malts
with
a
dry
hoppiness
and
sugar
it
reminds
me
of
how
root
beer
lollipops
used
to
smell
when
i
went
to
the
doctor
as
a
small
child
appearance
is
a
clear
grainy
copper
color
with
a
medium
sized
tan
head
flavor
is
quite
hoppy
big
malts
candy
caramel
sugary
and
very
small
plum
note
palate
is
sugary
sweet
and
every
so
slightly
dry
overall
its
pretty
good
stuff
a
bit
to
sweet
for
a
barley
wine
but
you
cant
notice
the
high
alcohol
content
and
is
very
easily
drinkable
its
good
i
do
have
1
more
which
i
will
age
though
judging
by
the
current
abv
and
no
feeling
of
a
body
i
dont
expect
much
might
just
have
to
trade
it
away
side
note
this
seems
to
be
borderline
dipa
if
it
was
one
it
might
score
a
bit
higher
an
impressive
beer
from
avery
this
is
not
among
my
favorites
of
the
style
way
to
bitter
for
me
and
hard
to
drink
something
i
wont
purchase
again
age
does
this
beer
wonders
it
smooths
out
and
evens
up
hops
are
way
mellowed
but
still
evident
the
malt
has
really
picked
up
some
excellent
flavor
with
time
this
one
is
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
big
bubbled
light
tan
head
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
mellow
toffee
malt
with
a
touch
of
ocean
air
the
flavor
is
herbal
hops
within
some
clean
carbonation
its
a
mellow
blend
of
malt
and
hops
crisp
and
pretty
easy
drinking
pleasant
agreeable
a
winner
first
sip
reveals
an
average
body
with
slightly
watery
texture
and
very
mild
carbonation
flavor
is
caramel
and
apricots
with
hints
of
bitter
hop
notes
mixing
in
i
get
lots
of
peppery
alcohol
which
makes
the
beer
a
sipper
definitely
some
warmth
on
the
finish
an
oky
beer
that
doesnt
conceal
its
booze
and
isnt
the
easiest
to
drink
not
bad
though
full
body
low
carbonation
a
hop
bomb
for
sure
doesnt
seem
to
be
enough
maly
to
support
the
show
but
that
seems
to
be
the
style
pours
orange
amber
with
a
thin
head
this
becomes
fine
whisps
subsequent
pours
reveal
a
bit
better
head
retentions
some
trailing
lace
sticks
the
smell
is
of
juicy
grapefruit
orange
pine
resin
with
caramel
backing
is
this
a
carmelized
dipa
or
a
bw
no
matter
im
loving
it
the
taste
is
of
bitter
grapefruit
and
resin
with
a
caramel
sweet
backing
not
very
complex
but
works
well
in
a
straightforward
way
warming
alcohol
present
but
very
wellcovered
leading
to
a
dry
finish
fullbodied
with
enough
carbonation
to
clean
the
palate
of
most
of
the
syrupy
stickiness
often
present
in
the
style
it
has
a
bit
of
a
shorter
finish
than
many
though
the
hops
do
linger
a
bit
of
a
different
feel
for
the
style
but
one
that
works
exceptionally
well
and
helps
bring
up
drinkability
that
being
said
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
one
of
the
smoothest
ive
had
of
styleabv
level
the
alcohol
which
is
usually
present
in
this
brewerys
big
beers
is
verywell
hidden
after
finishing
i
was
looking
for
more
though
was
grateful
for
having
only
the
one
bottle
when
i
woke
up
the
next
morning
if
you
are
looking
for
a
hoppy
interpretation
of
the
style
well
this
is
it
decent
although
not
great
barleywine
barleywines
arent
my
favorite
but
this
is
a
really
good
one
tons
of
flavor
tons
of
alcohol
tons
of
barleywine
super
enjoyable
a
little
pricy
but
ill
be
having
it
again
and
looking
for
it
on
tap
a
22oz
bomber
poured
into
a
snifter
it
was
a
hazy
brown
color
not
particulary
attractive
with
a
thin
head
it
had
a
sweet
malt
aroma
along
with
some
floral
aroma
the
taste
was
mostly
reminiscent
of
caramel
with
a
little
hops
presence
i
thought
the
beer
was
a
little
on
the
mild
side
but
still
pretty
good
and
its
probably
just
the
style
but
i
dont
find
it
the
most
drinkable
beer
too
much
residue
on
the
tongue
its
good
for
an
excellent
pint
but
maybe
not
a
session
beer
i
have
had
many
of
averys
offerings
this
was
a
good
one
i
enjoyed
it
chilled
in
a
snifter
poured
a
rich
amber
color
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
smell
of
thick
oily
hops
and
some
floral
bitter
fruits
taste
of
oily
heavy
hops
warms
the
palate
with
a
slick
finish
the
taste
was
initially
similar
to
other
bwines
i
have
had
then
it
really
left
them
in
the
dust
you
started
off
with
the
familiar
face
of
really
sweet
malt
then
i
got
a
spicy
note
and
some
hop
bitterness
to
round
it
out
the
body
is
full
and
the
alcohol
is
tasted
in
the
mouth
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
matter
as
the
overall
moneyness
of
the
beer
fades
your
mind
to
a
better
place
i
would
recommend
this
to
even
those
who
are
not
fond
of
barleywines
maybe
the
excesses
hops
in
this
appeal
to
the
hop
head
in
me
this
is
a
wicked
solid
beer
the
hops
flavor
was
pretty
intense
more
so
than
expected
with
fruity
juicy
citrus
flavors
following
shortly
after
the
initial
hop
wave
the
body
is
fairly
medium
little
more
carbonated
than
most
bws
ive
had
this
beer
was
smooth
and
full
of
flavor
mmm
22oz
bomber
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
the
bottle
states
the
bitterness
level
at
100
ibus
which
increases
my
anticipation
to
feed
my
hop
craving
the
beer
pours
a
the
aroma
is
just
exploding
with
flavors
sweet
malt
and
caramel
accompanied
by
a
burst
of
piney
hops
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
up
front
with
an
explosion
of
bitter
hops
in
the
finish
that
linger
in
your
mouth
well
after
the
sip
the
taste
is
a
lot
smoother
than
most
barleywines
and
the
malt
and
hops
seem
to
be
working
together
in
harmony
to
provide
exceptional
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
barleywines
on
the
market
if
you
havent
tried
this
one
yet
do
yourself
a
favor
and
get
your
hands
on
a
bottle
recommended
there
seems
to
be
a
current
backlash
for
extreme
american
beers
these
beers
are
slandered
for
being
over
the
top
and
lacking
nuance
count
me
as
a
fan
of
any
well
done
excessive
american
beer
this
one
definitely
is
that
as
for
averys
selection
of
bombers
the
double
ipa
and
similar
bombers
that
are
readily
available
to
me
such
as
hop
rod
rye
id
say
this
is
a
good
one
but
not
the
best
granted
i
like
the
hopped
bomber
category
a
lot
drinkability
this
isnt
a
bad
barleywine
by
any
stretch
it
is
a
really
easy
drinking
hoppy
barleywine
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
make
the
line
between
barleywine
and
dipa
extremely
thin
whenever
i
cant
decide
whether
i
want
a
dipa
or
a
bw
and
bigfoot
isnt
in
season
i
reach
for
this
one
md
mouthfeel
is
heavy
smooth
and
complex
and
has
the
effect
of
a
creaminess
as
it
rolls
over
the
tongue
carbonation
only
enhances
everything
else
and
helps
to
bring
everything
together
nicely
fantastic
example
of
the
style
a
nice
offering
and
i
am
glad
that
i
picked
it
after
seeing
it
for
years
not
sure
i
will
rush
to
pick
another
one
up
though
i
appreciate
its
complexity
with
my
continued
venture
into
this
style
sip
slowly
packs
a
punch
personally
i
prefer
fullbodied
thick
syrupy
barleywines
but
this
one
sacrifices
some
body
for
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
mostly
unnoticeable
anywhere
except
in
my
body
and
if
i
stand
up
now
im
probably
in
danger
of
falling
over
as
long
as
im
sitting
i
think
i
could
drink
these
all
night
drinkability
ok
not
great
not
the
most
complex
of
barleywines
this
poured
a
slightly
hazy
light
brown
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
it
smelled
pretty
bitter
like
a
lot
of
hops
and
a
bit
of
spice
it
had
a
very
strong
flavor
of
mostly
hops
with
some
yeast
the
aftertaste
was
of
more
hops
and
alcohol
making
this
beer
definitely
better
to
sip
the
texture
was
moderate
but
a
little
thin
with
decent
carbonation
overall
it
was
a
good
drink
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
d
i
couldnt
bring
myself
to
finish
it
this
just
isnt
for
me
sampled
on
tap
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
some
offwhite
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
big
and
vibrant
fresh
and
awesomely
fruity
hops
with
notes
of
juicy
apricot
like
hop
aromas
taste
is
blanced
and
nicely
hopped
but
with
a
caramelly
sweet
maltiness
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
as
well
ridiculously
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
for
a
barley
wine
slightly
viscous
body
and
a
fantastic
smooth
example
of
the
style
great
beer
d
i
like
this
a
lot
but
its
way
too
sweet
to
be
a
good
session
beer
and
the
abv
could
knock
you
flat
after
two
bombers
this
is
just
about
the
fruitiest
barley
wine
that
ive
ever
tasted
and
i
prefer
my
bws
to
be
a
bit
more
dry
all
of
that
aside
this
is
a
damn
good
after
dinner
sipper
or
a
heavy
hitting
night
cap
very
flavorful
beer
rich
and
complex
scarily
drinkable
this
is
on
the
whole
fairly
good
but
its
also
certainly
one
of
my
least
favorite
offerings
from
avery
id
love
to
see
avery
add
lots
of
caramel
to
hog
heaven
which
would
doubtlessly
improve
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
of
a
beer
that
lacks
a
definitive
identity
this
is
a
great
barleywine
its
assertive
without
being
forceful
solid
this
beer
poured
a
chestnut
brown
with
a
tan
one
finger
head
right
from
the
tap
into
a
tulip
glass
it
wreaked
of
hops
wheat
and
fruits
the
tastes
were
extremely
hoppy
with
hints
of
grapefruit
and
malts
the
hops
definitely
hid
the
malt
flavor
it
is
a
good
hop
beer
and
if
your
are
afraid
of
hops
this
may
not
be
for
you
it
was
easy
to
drink
for
me
but
definitely
not
a
session
one
finger
head
with
good
lacing
dark
amber
in
the
glass
very
mellow
hop
aroma
that
gets
better
as
i
go
through
the
glass
slightly
sweet
at
first
with
mild
carbonation
twigging
my
tongue
very
low
hop
bitters
malts
are
disguised
in
the
hops
alcohol
seems
very
mild
in
this
not
getting
it
in
the
taste
or
aroma
a
lite
and
mild
brew
drinkability
wow
i
would
give
this
a
4
5
on
drinkability
even
with
the
9
2
abv
that
clings
and
sticks
this
is
quickly
on
my
top
5
american
barleywines
list
avery
sure
does
make
some
good
beer
a
fine
drink
though
i
am
enjoying
this
one
a
lot
light
spice
of
alcohol
highly
drinkable
despite
being
way
above
what
youd
expect
for
a
session
beer
dthis
was
probably
the
best
barleywine
i
have
had
wonderfully
malty
then
americanized
with
tons
of
hops
obviously
youre
gonna
put
down
many
of
these
but
its
a
wonderful
to
break
out
for
special
occasions
whatever
those
are
for
you
despite
the
complexity
and
strength
it
goes
down
quite
well
this
is
the
first
beer
from
avery
that
has
truly
wowed
me
i
dont
care
if
this
is
a
dipa
or
barleywine
or
somewhere
in
between
it
tastes
great
i
am
now
curious
to
see
how
this
thing
ages
highly
recommended
avery
has
done
a
great
job
on
this
barleywine
it
is
very
bitter
but
if
you
are
hop
head
like
me
it
wont
phase
you
hog
heaven
is
balanced
and
light
enough
to
drink
all
night
if
you
can
handle
the
booze
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
apple
cider
and
copper
color
in
my
trois
pistoles
goblet
coudy
with
little
head
and
no
carbonation
aroma
bursts
with
hops
but
at
100
ibus
what
do
you
expect
understated
sweet
fruit
like
strawberries
candi
sugar
too
the
tatse
is
suprisingly
mildy
hoppy
even
with
the
high
ibu
little
evidence
of
hop
bite
in
the
finish
mild
fruity
esters
but
very
flavorful
particularly
as
it
warms
nice
viscous
mouthfeel
the
candi
sugar
and
malt
sweetness
shines
a
barleywine
with
understated
hoppiness
fasinating
and
yet
again
another
stellar
effort
by
avery
pours
reddishbrown
into
a
snifter
has
a
nice
fluffy
tan
head
with
decent
retention
a
spotty
persistent
lacing
is
left
behind
smells
of
hops
and
pine
surrounded
by
sweet
caramel
a
deeper
whiff
reveals
the
malts
dark
fruits
and
a
hint
of
esters
big
malts
fill
the
palate
with
a
definite
alcohol
heat
in
the
back
some
fruitiness
and
hop
balance
bring
things
to
a
slightly
bitter
fruition
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
excellent
leaving
clusters
of
tiny
active
bubbles
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
complexity
and
tastiness
of
this
brew
lands
it
near
the
top
of
my
barley
wine
list
all
and
all
a
really
good
barley
wine
i
wish
it
had
a
date
of
some
sort
i
also
wish
i
had
a
case
in
my
basement
i
recommend
this
beer
to
people
who
like
american
barley
wines
the
dry
hopping
does
so
much
for
aroma
but
its
really
not
a
bitterness
bomb
bitter
yes
but
not
over
the
top
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
oily
with
a
mediumlight
body
mild
carbonation
a
very
approachable
barleywine
not
over
the
top
full
bodied
but
smooth
rather
than
chewy
almost
too
easy
to
drink
try
to
take
your
time
and
enjoy
definitely
a
barleywine
for
hopheads
very
nice
like
a
malty
dipa
this
is
one
that
might
mellow
and
improve
even
more
with
age
if
you
can
put
some
away
for
next
winter
d
a
great
example
of
the
style
its
huge
in
every
way
a
year
has
done
a
lot
for
this
one
as
the
hops
are
at
a
good
level
which
balances
the
beer
much
better
good
drinkability
for
the
style
go
pick
this
one
up
but
be
careful
in
fresh
examples
those
hops
can
kill
im
so
glad
that
avery
started
distributing
to
missouri
this
is
a
really
nice
barleywine
that
ill
be
having
again
d
add
it
too
the
list
of
not
a
bad
barleywine
at
all
liked
it
very
much
nearly
an
extreme
beer
but
still
very
drinkable
with
this
being
my
first
venture
into
barleywines
im
quite
pleased
with
the
outcome
im
a
very
solid
dipa
kind
of
guy
so
i
was
pretty
scared
of
the
overly
sweet
possibility
of
barleywines
this
one
didnt
hit
that
instead
it
seemed
a
well
balanced
brew
not
too
dissimilar
from
a
good
dipa
bottled
pours
a
nice
cantalopeamber
color
very
little
head
aroma
is
sweet
and
crisp
the
flavor
is
big
bold
very
thorough
on
the
tongue
there
is
a
big
hoppine
flavor
with
a
metallic
like
tinge
on
the
backside
it
does
not
seem
as
overly
sweet
as
one
of
the
other
barleywines
that
im
familiar
with
a
good
winner
of
a
beer
here
mf
d
velvety
smooth
and
medium
carbonation
still
like
a
dipa
puckering
solventlike
astringent
finish
gets
syrupy
when
it
warms
a
great
brew
but
like
all
things
with
this
much
flavor
and
alcohol
the
d
gets
a
little
low
at
the
price
this
will
be
a
regular
barleywine
to
keep
on
hand
nice
creamy
body
with
good
carbonation
an
extreme
version
of
the
style
but
well
balanced
and
very
good
i
loved
this
barleywine
a
lot
i
actually
think
its
every
bit
as
good
as
old
ruffian
and
bigfoot
its
widely
available
to
me
too
awesome
the
bottom
line
if
youre
looking
for
an
american
style
barley
wine
you
can
do
a
lot
worse
than
hog
heaven
it
has
a
big
grapefruit
presence
and
a
long
bitter
aftertaste
which
fans
of
the
style
will
likely
enjoy
served
in
a
delirium
tremens
tulip
glass
nice
orange
color
with
a
goodsized
foamy
head
strong
hoppy
aroma
more
than
i
expected
from
a
barleywine
taste
was
enjoyable
again
more
hops
than
i
expected
for
the
style
nice
aspects
of
malt
and
pine
very
smooth
drinking
this
beer
seemed
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
traditional
barleywine
this
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
given
the
style
but
a
very
pleasant
drink
edit
ages
incredibly
wellat
2
years
it
was
a
beautiful
blend
of
rich
caramel
toffee
malts
with
a
nice
hop
flavor
bitterness
had
faded
a
bit
but
still
good
reminiscent
of
a
nicely
aged
bigfoot
barleywine
pig
can
fly
a
solid
ameriv
this
is
the
kind
of
strong
ale
which
you
can
consume
at
a
faster
rate
than
sipping
mode
its
not
over
the
top
which
makes
this
a
winner
for
most
days
im
not
even
a
particular
fan
of
barleywines
but
i
really
loved
this
one
an
outstanding
sample
from
avery
bursting
with
flavor
richness
and
character
appearance
is
a
very
appealing
copperbronze
slightly
rubyred
color
with
decent
head
that
soon
dissipated
smell
is
unbelievably
complex
with
a
thick
rich
aroma
bursting
with
malts
caramel
brown
sugar
and
sweet
candy
flavor
strongly
complements
the
smell
with
thick
maltiness
vanilla
cinnamon
and
caramel
notes
incredibly
heavy
and
thick
flavor
lingers
on
the
tongue
with
a
good
mouthfeel
and
surprisingly
easy
drinkability
for
a
hefty
9
2
abv
malty
sweetness
cancels
out
the
alcohol
and
you
are
left
with
an
allaround
outstanding
brew
recommended
extremely
happy
with
this
purchase
highly
reccomended
across
the
board
this
was
a
good
beer
everything
about
it
screamed
barleywine
to
me
it
smelled
looked
tasted
and
felt
exactly
the
way
i
would
expect
from
a
barleywine
im
pleased
because
i
have
recently
tried
several
offerings
from
avery
that
have
been
somewhat
disappointing
there
was
nothing
exceptional
about
this
beer
unfortunately
this
review
is
probably
not
very
helpful
if
you
do
not
know
what
i
expect
from
a
barleywine
but
if
you
want
to
find
out
try
this
beer
this
beer
is
a
great
value
4
99
for
a
bomber
at
the
local
liquor
store
its
not
something
i
would
have
everyday
but
on
a
cool
night
like
this
one
this
one
fits
the
bill
poured
from
an
avery
22
oz
bottle
as
a
reddish
brown
brew
with
a
fluffy
light
brown
head
i
bought
this
about
a
month
ago
there
is
no
freshness
or
bottled
date
so
i
dont
know
its
age
the
aroma
shows
malt
sweetness
and
hoppiness
which
carries
through
to
the
taste
that
also
includes
a
degree
of
spice
and
carbonation
the
alcohol
becomes
more
warming
at
the
finish
i
dont
feel
like
i
am
in
heaven
but
the
warmth
and
spice
is
welcome
on
a
cold
winter
evening
it
poured
a
orange
red
caramel
color
with
a
small
head
that
fell
in
a
minute
it
smelled
of
strong
hops
and
sweet
caramel
the
taste
was
great
it
had
of
course
a
strong
hoppy
flavor
duh
its
a
barleywine
but
it
also
had
some
citrus
malt
and
caramel
flavors
the
bitterness
was
pretty
strong
because
of
the
hops
but
quickly
mellows
out
in
the
after
taste
but
it
causes
a
bit
of
dryness
in
the
mouth
during
that
time
i
doubt
i
could
take
down
two
of
these
in
a
row
but
it
was
good
for
one
bottle
an
awesome
beer
still
say
its
more
like
a
double
ipa
than
a
barley
wine
though
this
beer
poured
a
brown
color
with
an
orange
tinge
there
was
a
noticeable
head
that
fell
within
minutes
the
aroma
is
malty
and
caramel
this
is
quite
hoppy
as
well
although
the
hop
aroma
mellows
as
the
beer
warms
the
taste
is
malty
and
bold
hops
are
very
prominent
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
leaves
a
slickness
in
the
back
of
the
throat
overall
this
is
a
tasty
brew
that
id
almost
call
a
cross
between
a
barleywine
and
dipa
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
lay
back
in
the
cellar
for
a
few
years
i
love
this
beer
and
i
plan
on
buying
outt
he
only
store
near
me
that
i
know
sells
it
everytime
they
get
some
in
maybe
ill
leave
one
or
two
for
some
other
lucky
beer
lover
after
drinking
a
slew
of
ipas
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
get
my
server
recommend
hog
heaven
malty
chewy
piney
notes
with
brown
sugar
overtones
a
very
nice
barley
wine
with
a
lighter
than
usual
color
this
beer
had
nice
character
with
an
excellent
palate
finish
not
overly
sweet
sort
of
a
cross
between
a
heavy
barley
wine
and
an
ale
kind
of
like
dessert
hog
heaven
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
and
red
with
a
lot
of
head
of
course
the
nose
is
fairly
muted
with
what
seems
like
a
mild
pineapple
skin
smell
the
flavor
is
smooth
with
a
fruity
edge
maybe
raspberry
and
oranges
together
but
just
a
little
bit
overall
it
is
a
smooth
and
even
brew
with
little
going
against
it
d
alcohol
felt
in
my
head
a
little
in
my
mouth
at
the
last
sip
due
to
warmth
d
i
really
wasnt
expecting
this
from
a
barleywine
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
sweeter
and
barleyier
but
really
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
nonetheless
and
very
fresh
to
boot
so
i
have
no
complaints
here
very
drinkable
scarily
so
for
abv
probably
the
hoppiest
barleywine
ive
ever
had
are
we
sure
this
isnt
a
dipa
i
liked
it
a
lot
a
barleywine
for
hopheads
i
need
a
recipe
like
this
its
freaking
good
beer
drinkability
awesome
this
is
an
ipa
barley
wine
it
is
excellent
and
heavenly
for
enjoyable
sipping
at
the
same
time
it
goes
down
easy
so
you
could
mistakenly
drink
it
fast
i
only
wish
it
came
in
12oz
bottles
so
i
could
more
precisely
dose
myself
with
this
nectar
i
did
nibble
on
some
clawson
blue
stilton
at
times
in
this
beer
which
was
nice
but
it
also
held
its
own
without
the
cheese
the
aroma
is
huge
with
citrus
hop
character
such
as
tangerine
and
lime
the
malt
struggles
to
fight
past
this
tremendous
hop
presence
but
does
reveal
itself
in
the
taste
but
make
no
mistake
about
it
this
beer
is
all
about
the
hops
there
is
a
faint
candylike
sweetness
that
helps
to
balance
out
the
pronounced
bitterness
but
the
highlight
of
this
beer
is
the
citrus
character
itll
be
interesting
to
see
how
well
this
does
with
a
bit
of
age
behind
it
heavy
in
texture
with
a
velvety
smoothness
some
good
warmth
characteristic
of
the
style
very
nice
flavorful
and
complex
thank
you
much
to
the
friend
who
turned
me
on
to
this
brew
a
good
barleywine
one
i
will
definetly
try
again
good
body
not
overly
big
but
no
slouch
alcohol
shows
through
in
the
mouth
with
a
bit
of
a
straight
whiskey
feel
to
it
defintely
a
sipper
the
fig
and
tofee
in
this
really
help
keep
the
hops
at
bay
yet
the
hops
overpower
this
young
bw
this
will
age
wonderfully
and
id
much
enjoy
a
year
old
bottle
a
golden
raisin
quality
with
slight
mollasses
not
hugely
complex
but
sometimes
they
dont
need
to
be
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
big
american
barleywine
a
large
and
flavorful
malt
background
balanced
nicely
by
a
equally
huge
hop
profile
and
it
isnt
afraid
to
wear
a
little
alcohol
on
its
sleave
a
steady
sipper
for
sure
thats
quick
to
consume
and
one
that
im
quite
glad
to
have
enjoyed
when
poured
the
color
was
of
a
hazy
medium
amber
with
a
reddish
hue
that
pourd
medium
thick
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
filled
the
nose
also
a
hint
of
candy
was
evident
the
taste
was
of
a
well
balance
of
bitter
and
sweetness
the
flavor
was
of
roasted
malts
hops
caramel
and
some
sort
of
fruit
cant
put
my
hands
on
it
but
it
could
be
figs
of
a
nature
overall
the
balance
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
didnt
over
power
the
flavors
another
winner
from
avery
brewing
this
one
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
thick
and
foamy
off
white
head
some
lacing
is
left
behind
on
the
glass
smell
is
piney
hops
grape
thick
malt
it
definitely
smells
strong
like
a
barleywine
the
first
sip
reminds
me
of
a
barleywine
but
the
finish
is
not
as
strong
reminds
me
of
a
double
ipa
in
the
finish
and
the
mouth
feeling
not
as
harsh
as
a
barleywine
and
almost
as
smooth
as
some
double
ipas
d
i
like
it
a
lot
and
will
have
again
a
great
way
to
end
the
day
or
after
a
great
dinner
damn
now
i
need
to
go
out
and
by
a
smoking
jacket
a
dog
and
a
fireplace
d
if
one
is
not
careful
this
bottle
could
be
consumed
in
an
hour
or
so
the
flavors
are
that
intense
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
great
way
to
end
my
night
bomber
boured
into
rr
damnation
tulip
nice
looking
beer
hazy
dark
marmalade
colour
with
surprising
amount
of
head
nose
is
super
sweet
frankly
scared
me
a
little
i
was
hoping
this
wasnt
sickley
sweet
taste
it
is
sweet
but
not
too
bad
sweet
doughy
malt
with
piney
woody
hop
overtones
theres
a
little
earthy
tobacoo
as
well
finishes
dry
creamy
mouthfeel
really
creamy
slides
right
down
the
big
ibus
really
play
well
in
this
beer
its
worthy
competition
to
its
instate
rival
gd
old
ruffian
close
but
no
cigar
nice
barleywine
all
and
all
drinkability
hop
lovers
will
dig
it
im
probably
good
for
a
couple
glasses
but
no
more
if
you
love
the
style
you
will
find
it
probably
too
easy
to
drink
i
usually
write
a
lot
of
details
on
these
reviews
but
i
am
just
going
to
say
for
sure
one
of
if
not
the
best
barleywine
i
have
sampled
to
date
also
a
fan
of
duck
rabbits
i
had
to
really
try
not
to
just
drink
it
all
up
right
away
just
give
it
a
shot
you
wont
be
disappointed
although
this
one
looks
smells
and
tastes
more
like
an
iipa
than
a
barleywine
to
me
what
counts
is
that
it
is
an
awesome
beer
slightly
hazy
dark
amber
color
with
a
huge
light
tan
head
that
has
decent
retention
and
tons
of
lace
smells
hoppy
hoppy
hoppy
piney
citrusy
yummy
hint
of
caramelly
malt
in
the
background
taste
the
hoppiest
barleywine
ive
ever
had
and
this
one
is
fresh
so
maybe
it
needs
to
mellow
a
bit
the
hop
taste
is
divine
though
and
there
is
definitely
a
sweet
caramelly
bready
malt
backbone
full
body
strong
drink
easily
and
pleasurably
quaffed
by
me
but
this
is
a
big
big
beer
and
may
be
a
challenge
for
some
clear
deep
copper
colored
medium
khaki
head
fair
amount
of
lace
big
caramel
malt
nose
malt
front
backed
up
with
some
bitter
hops
in
the
back
this
could
fall
into
an
ipa
but
for
the
advanced
level
of
malt
some
lemony
notes
a
bit
a
nuttiness
alcohol
makes
its
way
into
the
picture
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
pretty
solid
very
good
barley
wine
uncommonly
smooth
and
great
carbonation
just
right
i
have
drank
lots
of
different
barley
wines
and
this
one
is
great
one
of
my
favorites
for
sure
also
an
important
feature
for
me
at
least
is
how
consistent
this
ale
is
its
recipe
is
right
on
every
time
ive
had
it
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
very
enjoyable
almost
scary
easy
to
drink
knowing
the
alcohol
content
poured
a
cloudy
copper
color
with
good
head
that
stayed
forever
nice
hoppy
aroma
with
hint
of
citrus
grapefruit
taste
is
hoppy
and
citrusy
with
a
malty
finish
pretty
well
balanced
tastes
very
much
like
an
english
ipa
but
stronger
i
wish
i
had
some
more
of
this
that
i
could
let
age
but
i
live
in
mississippi
so
unavailable
here
lacing
was
decent
good
but
to
me
not
great
still
i
enjoyed
i
split
this
with
my
friend
who
just
got
in
to
grad
school
and
ended
up
drinking
the
majority
of
the
bottle
i
think
the
year
of
cellaring
really
helped
this
beer
to
be
honest
it
could
probably
stand
a
little
while
longer
all
told
not
my
favorite
barleywine
this
beer
pours
a
clear
brownishamber
color
the
head
is
massive
billowy
and
creamy
tan
in
color
lacing
is
thorough
with
big
chunks
of
foam
sticking
all
over
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
grapefruit
caramel
plums
dates
and
is
moderately
hot
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
with
the
grapefruit
up
front
followed
by
dry
caramel
and
dates
and
plums
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
it
is
a
bit
drier
than
most
other
barley
wines
i
have
had
which
i
think
detracts
from
the
beer
a
little
bit
but
not
too
significantly
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
isnt
the
best
barley
wine
out
there
but
it
is
still
good
and
i
would
drink
it
again
d
my
first
barleywine
i
think
and
im
loving
it
a
great
balance
of
hops
and
elegant
caramel
tasting
malt
im
excited
the
explore
the
genre
more
and
hope
that
there
are
more
beers
like
this
one
out
there
pours
a
deep
rubymahogany
color
no
noticeable
carbonation
cream
colored
head
settles
fairly
slowly
to
leave
a
nice
layer
of
foam
and
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
tends
towards
dried
fruit
like
apricots
or
raisins
possibly
even
some
tobacco
notes
as
well
taste
is
somewhat
pink
grapefruity
some
resiny
sweetness
heavy
malt
flavor
but
to
me
it
tastes
more
like
a
really
good
dipa
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
sticky
aftertaste
last
for
a
while
drinkability
is
very
nice
slightly
lower
abv
than
i
wouldve
expected
well
done
avery
id
like
to
try
this
again
on
tap
if
i
could
d
this
is
a
sipping
beer
however
can
see
drinking
a
few
glasses
of
these
which
would
be
a
considerable
amount
based
on
the
abv
and
can
quickly
sneak
up
on
you
has
a
strong
rather
fruity
aroma
with
a
little
bit
of
an
alcohol
nip
color
is
a
clear
dark
amber
brown
with
a
thick
and
largebubbled
head
flavor
is
fruity
and
has
a
strong
bitter
undertone
the
alcohol
bite
is
quite
noticeable
it
is
nice
and
smooth
very
drinkable
but
better
sipped
since
it
is
a
highgravity
beer
d
but
dont
go
back
to
the
glass
too
quickly
as
the
high
abv
indicates
this
beer
will
knock
you
down
in
a
hurry
if
you
quaff
it
too
eagerly
this
is
a
brew
to
savor
probably
over
a
couple
of
hours
if
youre
tackling
all
22
ounces
by
yourself
taking
a
long
time
with
this
one
is
rewarding
as
the
flavors
linger
and
evolve
between
swallows
particularly
as
it
warms
cracking
open
a
second
one
for
further
study
however
would
be
a
fools
mission
overall
i
find
this
a
very
drinkable
barleywine
i
can
drink
year
round
some
say
it
ages
well
but
i
prefer
it
fresh
and
full
of
hops
d
a
very
solid
barleywine
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
much
like
a
strong
ipa
though
there
is
too
much
malt
to
keep
it
in
that
category
a
hint
less
malt
and
a
bit
more
hops
would
have
made
this
perfectly
balanced
the
one
bottle
is
plenty
for
me
this
is
my
new
favorite
american
barleywine
d
this
is
the
most
drinkable
barley
wine
that
ive
had
it
is
not
overpowering
and
is
easily
consumable
in
one
sitting
despite
the
high
alcohol
content
and
size
of
the
beer
avery
hog
heaven
barleywine
looks
like
a
dream
smells
like
a
dream
feels
like
a
dream
and
drinks
like
a
dream
im
tempted
to
nudge
the
flavor
score
to
the
same
dreamlike
position
but
something
is
holding
me
back
in
any
case
i
like
this
big
hog
just
fine
looks
like
ill
have
to
buy
a
few
bombers
the
next
time
im
in
ohio
looking
to
start
a
cellar
look
no
further
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
balanced
well
thoroughly
enjoyed
d
this
was
a
lot
hoppier
than
expected
and
is
definitely
a
very
easygoing
barleywine
unlike
some
pours
a
crisp
dark
amber
with
a
decent
head
that
lasts
and
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
hops
with
some
malts
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
pleasantly
hoppy
with
a
great
malt
backbone
the
beer
is
somewhat
heavy
but
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
this
one
certainly
seems
to
be
treading
awfully
close
to
dipa
territory
but
therefore
this
one
is
very
enjoyable
even
on
a
warm
late
spring
afternoon
mmmmm
i
say
mmm

this
was
a
very
nice
barleywine
very
enjoyable
im
glad
they
didnt
push
the
abv
too
much
as
its
still
very
rich
but
not
too
hot
if
you
see
these
buy
a
few
drink
one
right
away
and
sit
on
the
rest
for
a
long
while
not
the
most
mind
blowing
american
barley
wine
ive
ever
had
but
its
pretty
good
especially
considering
how
people
i
know
tend
to
dump
on
avery
pretty
bad
a
solid
beer
for
hop
heads
or
big
beer
folks
i
wish
this
was
bottle
conditioned
cheers
drinkability
went
down
too
easy
abv
was
not
a
factor
i
had
no
hesitation
at
all
tipping
the
glass
into
my
pie
hole
d
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
barleywine
but
would
make
a
great
dipa
i
would
not
turn
this
down
maybe
needs
to
sit
for
a
while
to
bring
out
some
of
the
more
complex
flavors
must
i
can
take
it
as
it
is
as
well
from
a
22
oz
bottle
i
love
that
label
this
poured
a
red
to
amber
with
a
medium
tan
head
and
decent
lacing
nose
is
floral
hops
and
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
flavors
are
dominated
by
the
nops
with
some
sweet
caramel
malts
finish
ls
long
and
slightly
bitter
this
is
amazingly
easy
to
drink
and
hides
the
alcohol
well
a
first
rate
barley
wine
the
mouthful
is
a
bit
thinner
than
i
expected
as
well
still
fairly
full
but
the
carbonation
is
very
smooth
sticky
finish
with
a
residual
sweetness
yet
it
still
dries
out
the
palate
alcohol
burn
not
too
drinkable
ill
be
avoiding
this
one
in
the
future

of

in
the
background
sweet

flavors
upfront
followed
by
slight
dextrin
and
faint
vinous
alcohol
the
aftertaste
displays
highly
fruity

tones
of
orange
peel
and
grapefruit
rind
and
an
equally
agressive
resinous
pine
character
mediumfull
bodied
with
an
even
and
smooth
carbonation
that
lifts
enough
sweetness
to
prevent
cloyng
but
leaves
hop
resins
and
residual
caramel
on
the
tounge
finishes
a
touchy
fruity
with
a
hints
of
vinous
alcohol
and
a
diliberate
bitterness
the
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
have
faded
somewhat
over
time
but
still
balance
this
out
very
well
allowing
the
malt
profile
to
become
more
pronounced
and
giving
the
beer
a
more
wellrounded
flavor
that
being
said
your
average
hophead
would
enjoy
this
brew
even
greater
fresh
while
the
alpha
oils
are
more
fragrant
and
the
hop
flavor
is
more
aggressive

its
medium

abv
is
a
little
too
high
to
session
but
its
very
drinkable
carbonation
is
very
good
and
its
very
smooth
overall
its
a
good
beer
id
recommend
it
cheers
sweet

flavors

the
hops
right
from
the
start
extra
sweet
with

burnt
sugar
notes

the
sweetness
of
the
caramel
malt
backbone
is
pretty
hefty
100
ibus
in
the
nose
definitely
but
the
hops
in
the
flavor
are
a
bit
subduedprobably
due
to
me
sitting
this
aside
for
awhile
citrus
fruit
pine
needles
spicy
hops
and
a
tad
of
grassyness
prickly
hop
notes
dance
on
the
tongue
dryer
finish
with
a
sharp
bitterness
i
bet
the
hop
profile
would
be
a
bit
more
punchy
if
this
were
fresh
it
had
been
sitting
in
my
basement
for
half
a
year
or
so
definitely
still
quite
drinkable
with
a
high
abv
that
doesnt
make
you
cringe
oink
oink
great
stuff
here
this
has
instantly
become
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
if
not
my
favorite
the
balance
is
superb
and
it
doesnt
seem
all
that
strong
its
got
a
great
hop
profile
but
enough
malt
backing
to
let
you
know
that
its
not
an
ipa
highly
recommended
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
im
not
sure
it
is
screaming
this
is
a
barlewine
i
think
it
is
saying
this
is
a
strong
as
hell
beer
it
is
worth
trying
if
you
have
little
to
choose
from
avery
has
produced
a
very
good
tasting
barleywine
with
this
brew
it
isnt
as
full
bodied
as
some
of
the
really
big
barleywines
available
on
the
market
but
it
is
still
a
very
tasty
ale
that
really
hits
the
spot
when
you
get
a
craving
for
hops
copper
in
color
with
a
thick
almost
pearlescent
head
with
lacing
that
lasts
excellent
citrus
and
floral
aroma
taste
is
very
hoppy
and
complex
with
a
slight
hint
of
vanilla
in
the
middle
and
a
little
perfume
quality
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
bite
in
front
and
back
and
made
the
roof
of
my
mouth
tickle
odd
drinkability
is
good
for
a
high
gravity
beer
most
wont
drink
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
strong
but
not
a
particularly
large
beer
its
more
drinkable
than
old
guardian
some
nutty
characteristics
with
even
a
chocolate
hint
i
have
the
feeling
that
age
treated
this
beer
well
its
strong
but
completely
manageable
and
flavors
are
united
on
a
side
note
i
just
had
stones
10th
anniversary
and
stone
was
even
sweeter
than
this
although
it
is
a
dipa
and
this
was
much
better
as
well
pours
a
fairly
dirty
looking
amber
brown
with
a
small
white
head
smell
is
hops
taste
is
hops
barleywine
seems
more
like
a
dipa
to
me
and
not
a
good
one
hop
taste
is
bitter
not
citrusy
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
alcohol
is
not
suppressed
very
well
either
drinkability
is
poor
reminiscent
of
a
watered
down
dipa
dissappointing
and
not
a
contender
much
better
dipa
and
barleywines
to
be
had
22oz
bottle
split
with
a
friend
this
poured
a
ruby
red
with
a
rocky
white
head
on
top
the
smell
was
really
hoppy
and
a
little
sweet
the
taste
was
hops
hops
hops
also
some
raisin
flavor
and
caramel
overall
this
was
excellent
the
first
bottle
i
had
must
have
been
infected
because
it
tasted
like
barnyard
funk
this
bottle
was
excellent
this
is
a
barley
wine
nothing
like
what
ive
been
drinking
locally
if
this
had
been
labeled
sierra
nevadas
notsopale
ale
i
would
have
been
more
likely
to
believe
it
the
only
thing
that
resembles
a
barley
wine
for
me
is
the
alcohol
content
notes
the
hops
are
definitely
big
here
and
the
alcohol
is
center
stage
as
well
i
thought
it
was
odd
that
the
hops
seemed
to
become
drier
as
it
warmed
i
usually
find
big
barleywines
to
get
sweeter
and
maltier
as
they
warm
it
did
make
my
think
that
in
many
ways
this
was
closer
to
a
dipa
than
a
barleywine
or
rather
fell
somewhere
in
the
middle
stylewise
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
confirmed
hopheads
be
careful
though
as
that
alcohol
packs
a
nice
buzz
to
it
especially
if
youre
drinking
a
20
oz
pint
in
the
afternoon
stones
barleywine
offering
is
next
recommended
and
my
own
palates
filter
drinkability
wonderfully
drinkable
for
the
abv
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
but
still
provides
the
nice
warming
feeling
if
youre
a
barleywine
freak
and
you
love
imperial
ipas
you
will
love
this
beer
however
you
still
probably
wont
be
able
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
tastes
of
crisp
green
apples
dipped
in
rich
molasses
sweet
malty
hints
of
cinnamon
caramel
and
taffy
linger
accompanied
by
a
mix
of
fruits
and
sugars
that
fade
leaving
you
with
a
strong
sour
ethanol
aftertaste
too
strong
for
my
liking
very
similar
to
lagunitas
brown
shugga
in
a
lot
of
ways
only
a
lot
less
hops
and
a
lot
more
booze
its
funny
how
a
few
subtle
things
make
such
a
difference
hops
are
not
detectable
in
the
nose
or
palate
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
making
this
one
even
more
difficult
to
drink
my
throat
is
burning
i
dont
think
ill
finish
the
bottle
all
in
all
a
decent
barleywine
with
a
lot
of
potential
and
a
couple
unfortunate
flaws
bottle
ive
been
cellaring
for
a
while
for
no
particular
reason
other
than
that
i
had
other
thinks
i
wanted
to
drink
first
pours
red
like
strawberry
jelly
as
it
looks
in
the
jar
white
head
no
bubbles
happening
heavy
floral
hop
odor
smells
sweet
and
slightly
nutty
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
not
overbearingly
hoppy
like
a
really
young
b
w
can
be
kind
of
like
a
malt
syrup
might
taste
a
bit
thinner
than
id
like
doesnt
really
stand
out
among
the
barleywines
ive
had
d
hog
heaven
is
pretty
good
there
are
a
lot
of
better
barleywines
out
there
but
drinking
this
is
no
cruel
fate
i
might
have
this
one
again
if
i
ever
find
it
on
tap
or
something
a
winner
from
avery
that
clocks
in
at
a
measley
9
2
measley
by
avery
standards
of
course
cheers
it
reminds
me
of
a
barley
wine
i
brewed
the
yeast
gave
up
it
didnt
attenuate
so
i
dumped
in
the
dry
hops
to
compensate
it
didnt
really
work
either
this
bottle
was
probably
about
a
year
or
two
old
when
consumed
it
was
in
my
cellar
its
a
pretty
good
beer
but
seems
a
little
thin
for
a
barleywine
not
too
bad
for
the
price
lacks
any
semblance
of
balance
too
hoppy
andor
overly
attenuated
needs
to
taste
better
to
drink
a
high
abv
beer
from
a
22
oz
bottle
i
paid
decent
for
it
though
so
ill
choke
it
down
and
then
pass
out
an
aggressive
and
flavorful
barleywine
in
which
the
hops
are
main
attraction
too
young
and
unripe
to
be
considered
a
great
version
of
the
style
fairly
potent
especially
in
bitterness
but
ultimately
lacking
the
balance
required
to
pull
off
the
style
and
no
i
did
not
name
my
kid
after
the
brewery
i
brought
this
all
the
way
back
from
california
on
a
recent
trip
hog
heaven
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
with
a
thick
off
white
head
smell
is
huge
grapefruit
and
floral
hop
aroma
coupled
with
an
odd
earthiness
alcohol
is
slightly
apparent
if
i
really
look
hard
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
come
in
first
but
much
lighter
then
anticipated
very
smooth
the
rich
malt
flavor
really
shines
balancing
the
resiny
hop
flavor
the
beer
is
really
smooth
and
drinkable
while
maintaining
all
the
bold
characteristics
i
would
expect
from
an
american
barley
wine
i
wish
i
could
get
this
beer
locally
wavz
pours
a
dark
orange
amber
with
a
good
head
and
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
of
honeyed
grapefruit
sweet
malt
and
spicy
hops
interplay
nicely
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
quite
hoppy
for
a
barley
wine
bitter
hops
throughout
as
well
as
lots
of
honeyed
malt
that
builds
throughout
this
is
followed
by
a
winey
flavor
a
pleasant
waxy
taste
and
a
finish
of
black
tea
bitter
hopsand
grapefruit
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
nicely
restrained
carbonation
and
no
stickiness
very
drinkable
the
intense
hops
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
and
hold
your
interest
the
underlying
malt
zips
in
and
out
and
is
quite
delicious
nice
offering
d
its
pretty
good
but
not
really
a
barleywine
it
really
is
a
different
kind
of
flavor
but
is
still
good
just
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
barleywine
maybe
something
like
a
dipa
mixed
with
a
american
strong
ale
at
first
i
liked
this
beer
it
poured
a
nice
amber
head
with
enough
lace
to
make
me
want
to
drink
this
brut
smelled
flowerly
with
hints
of
bitterness
even
in
the
nose
at
first
sip
it
was
nice
i
could
tastt
the
hops
and
was
pleased
then
after
a
few
more
it
became
kind
of
medicinal
and
metalic
almost
too
much
on
one
note
i
dont
fancy
myself
a
barley
wine
drinker
i
think
i
prefer
it
sweeter
and
more
complex
drinkability
a
very
nice
barley
wine
indeed
great
aroma
pleasant
high
hoppiness
and
balance
i
had
a
chance
to
try
a
2004
and
2000
vintage
this
year
06
it
ages
quite
nicely
a
tasty
middle
of
the
road
american
barleywine
i
would
have
another
in
fact
i
have
another
in
the
beer
cellar
yeah
me
lsu
just
got
screwed
out
of
an
interception
but
this
beer
is
helping
to
make
it
a
bit
more
bearable
its
big
bitter
and
brash
but
its
also
welldone
and
fun
to
drink
its
not
complex
so
its
easy
in
spite
of
a
hot
and
heavy
abv
so
hopefully
notre
dame
wins
when
pigs
fly
and
if
im
not
truly
in
heaven
at
least
im
plenty
far
from
hell
pours
light
golden
with
a
moderate
amount
of
varying
head
that
laced
out
as
it
went
down
smells
a
tad
sharp
but
not
hoppy
tastes
nice
and
sweet
balanced
with
moderate
hoppiness
theres
something
complex
in
there
but
i
cant
quite
place
it
feels
smooth
on
the
tongue
with
a
clean
finish
id
put
down
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
the
pour
into
my
snifter
raises
a
thin
layer
of
surface
bubbles
which
are
just
a
tad
tan
the
legs
on
the
beer
are
quite
nice
very
thick
and
viscous
lacing
is
certainly
impressive
considering
its
abv
quite
hazy
with
a
golden
copper
body
the
nose
is
filled
with
juniper
notes
and
a
strong
caramel
profile
almost
burns
the
nostrils
seems
to
have
a
high
alcohol
profile
the
first
taste
does
not
impress
me
despite
the
ibus
the
beer
doesnt
showcase
much
bitterness
the
first
and
foremost
taste
is
alcohol
there
is
initial
hop
bite
but
the
flavor
recedes
quickly
theres
a
bit
of
bisciuty
malt
but
not
much
this
is
the
most
watery
bw
ive
had
theres
just
so
little
there
the
carbonation
is
adequate
for
the
style
though
a
lackluster
bw
this
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
reddish
congac
color
with
a
little
white
head
that
fades
away
strong
whiffs
of
lovely
citrusy
hops
and
some
alcohol
though
not
harsh
in
anyway
but
very
welcoming
tastes
of
yummy
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
balanced
by
a
good
malt
profile
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
and
this
beer
can
be
consumed
quite
easily
i
would
really
like
to
stock
up
on
this
brew
especially
since
it
is
so
decently
priced
pours
a
clear
reddish
mahogony
with
a
pretty
large
tan
foamy
head
a
nice
head
for
a
bw
the
smell
is
strong
with
dark
fruit
and
a
real
bisquity
aroma
very
bakery
like
the
taste
is
also
filled
with
dark
fruit
and
bread
yeastbut
also
has
a
real
hop
flavor
to
it
this
reminds
me
of
bigfoot
a
very
good
beerbut
hoppier
than
most
bws
the
mf
is
medium
with
all
flavors
mixing
wellalthough
the
hops
do
overpower
this
abit
a
damn
good
beer
that
should
not
be
missed
slainte
drinkability
was
lower
because
it
was
sort
of
filling
and
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
this
thing
is
a
major
alpha
oil
bomb
according
to
the
label
it
rings
in
at
about
100ibus
this
one
is
along
the
lines
of
an
american
double
ipa
as
far
as
hop
bitterness
goes
however
it
has
a
little
stronger
malt
presence
recommended
pours
a
deep
dark
honeyed
amber
bordering
on
brown
with
an
impressively
tenacious
offwhite
head
at
lower
temperatures
huge
grapefruit
aromas
as
it
warms
the
malts
come
out
so
those
grapefruits
mix
with
grahamy
sweet
notes
from
the
malt
the
taste
is
very
fruity
initially
but
some
rather
tight
doughy
notes
come
out
next
for
a
barleywine
in
this
style
its
pretty
balanced
between
hops
and
malt
but
its
very
bitter
mouthfeel
features
low
carbonation
slippery
thick
malts
and
harsh
hop
oils
overall
this
is
a
big
wellmade
barleywine
in
the
american
highhopped
tradition
well
done
but
i
dont
see
how
any
human
could
drink
22
ounces
of
it
in
one
sitting
maybe
i
had
too
high
expectations
with
avery

ive
really
enjoyed
their
other
offerings
this
one
goes
to
the
retry
pile

someday
someday
the
mouth
is
big
and
complex
some
fruit
and
sugar
in
the
middle
and
finishes
drier
and
hoppy
on
the
back
palate
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
barleywines
i
have
sampledwill
revisit
for
sure
good
brew
this
is
a
bw
that
ill
probably
buy
again
d
the
light
feel
and
crisp
hops
make
this
one
deceptively
quickdrinking
doesnt
play
close
to
the
vest
with
the
style
incorporating
serious
dipa
elements
takes
some
chances
but
succeeds
admirably
drinkability
one
will
be
enough
for
now
but
this
wont
be
my
last
one
of
these
babies
pours
dark
copper
to
murky
brown
in
color
with
a
cream
colored
small
head
some
rich
caramel
maltiness
in
there
but
the
hops
are
king
in
the
aroma
with
some
vitamin
c
orange
citrus
als
a
little
of
the
alcohol
presence
is
discernible
in
the
aroma
the
alcohol
comes
in
bigger
in
the
taste
as
do
the
orange
vit
c
hops
the
sweet
malts
are
there
but
subdued
in
the
background
i
do
like
a
hoppy
barleywine
but
was
hoping
for
some
rich
malts
tonite
maybe
they
would
show
a
little
better
with
some
age
in
this
beer
a
nice
am
barleywine
the
alcohol
was
a
little
over
the
top
in
the
flavor
for
me
at
first
but
it
mellowed
i
numbed
to
it
part
way
in
ive
been
impressed
with
other
offerings
from
avery
hopefully
his
will
continue
that
trend
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
darkamber
color
with
a
moderate
head
the
smell
is
much
like
other
barlywines
with
a
large
malt
presence
and
a
kiss
of
hops
throughout
the
nose
the
taste
is
big
but
nothing
that
really
blows
you
away
there
is
excellent
carbonation
which
lets
the
tastes
dance
on
the
tongue
without
getting
to
tired
or
overdeveloped
there
is
a
distinct
malt
taste
but
before
it
gets
too
sweet
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
comes
in
in
terms
of
barlywines
this
is
on
the
lighter
side
but
still
a
good
beer
d
very
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
dry
enough
to
leave
you
wanting
another
sip
real
soon
surprisingly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
for
a
barleywine
of
this
strength
becomes
more
enjoyable
and
complex
as
it
warms
a
pleasant
sipper
and
nicely
crafted
by
avery
this
ale
poured
a
not
quite
opaque
dark
amber
into
my
piraat
glass
and
smelled
of
caramel
malts
and
piney
and
spicy
hops
it
left
about
a
onefinger
head
and
plenty
of
spotty
lacing
as
i
proceeded
to
drink
it
down
some
tiny
bubbles
of
cabonation
where
noticeable
it
taste
a
little
less
hoppy
than
what
i
would
of
thought
from
the
nose
and
what
i
remember
from
having
tried
this
beer
before
on
second
thought
however
i
guess
it
is
pretty
hoppy
but
just
shrouded
in
a
nice
malty
blanket
you
might
find
some
cherry
and
plum
flavors
in
there
too
kinda
drinks
like
a
dipa
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
thick
full
and
creamy
with
enough
carbonation
this
brew
could
turn
into
some
heady
stuff
if
you
wanted
to
drink
a
few
most
definitely
worth
a
try
at
least
this
is
one
crazily
hopped
barley
wine
a
very
tasty
strong
ale
thats
actually
not
too
hard
to
handle
seems
like
its
worth
cellaring
a
bottle
or
two
this
is
up
there
on
my
barley
wine
list
along
with
the
trusty
old
ruffian
light
amber
very
clear
medium
height
head
of
offcream
color
beautifully
tight
bubbles
with
great
lasting
power
doesnt
smell
like
a
bw
weird
i
mean
its
very
light
airy
fruity
weird
ah
right
cause
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
bw
its
not
bad
or
anything
but
they
could
have
just
called
it
a
dipa
you
know
i
mean
really
its
pretty
darned
light
on
the
malts
light
on
flavor
and
heavy
enough
on
hops
ok
yeah
most
of
those
hops
are
just
bitter
but
you
still
get
a
taste
of
citrus
in
there
especially
in
the
nasty
aftertaste
the
body
like
the
flavor
is
way
light
for
a
bw
weird
what
were
they
thinking
but
hey
drinkable
sure
as
a
summer
beer
and
definitely
not
as
a
bw
pours
a
bright
light
amber
with
a
very
thin
yet
foamy
head
that
is
consistant
throughout
the
enjoyment
of
this
beer
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
the
nose
is
a
nice
mix
of
fruit
and
floral
elements
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
taste
of
this
beer
as
it
has
a
large
range
taking
you
from
from
quite
sweet
to
bitter
in
a
very
smooth
transition
with
the
aftertaste
maitaining
this
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
of
crisp
strong
carbonation
but
it
is
not
dominant
or
overpowering
it
still
allows
you
to
enjoy
the
ales
sweetness
the
presence
of
the
alcohol
is
also
present
in
the
taste
but
ever
so
slightly
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
i
couldnt
make
it
a
session
ale
however
this
takes
nothing
away
from
how
enjoyalbe
this
is
a
great
of
example
of
just
how
damn
good
beer
can
be
buy
this
beer
pours
an
amber
brownish
ale
with
iced
tea
like
foamness
with
no
head
that
klings
to
the
glass
with
dear
life
scent
of
floral
hops
and
rich
cascades
pulminate
my
oversized
tulip
glass
very
similar
to
an
imp
ipa
i
detect
barley
in
the
nose
aswell
full
of
flavour
and
a
lot
more
body
in
the
finish
than
other
barley
wines
ive
had
lots
of
hops
and
citrus
in
the
flavour
very
much
like
an
ipa
so
this
does
well
with
me
a
true
beer
for
any
hop
head
and
my
fav
so
far
for
this
style
the
only
downfall
for
this
is
the
9
abv
so
i
can
pretty
much
just
drink
one
props
to
avery
who
has
nailed
it
again
once
again
avery
amazes
me
i
simply
love
every
single
beer
of
thiers
that
i
have
ever
had
this
one
does
not
disappoint
although
it
doesnt
need
it
i
would
be
curious
what
would
happen
to
this
in
the
cellar
for
a
year
or
two
notes
reasonably
priced
and
dynamic
enough
to
warrant
the
purchase
at
least
in
this
household
an
excellent
barley
wine
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
avery
thus
far
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
these
definitely
pick
one
up
this
beer
is
a
personal
ad
readers
dream
come
true
sexy
sweet
and
strong
but
beware
the
unbridled
bitterness
and
know
this
at
100
ibus
and
9
2
abv
hog
heaven
truly
wears
the
pants
this
is
really
nice
and
not
such
an
assault
on
the
senses
as
others
can
be
goes
down
thick
yet
smooth
i
wonder
what
an
aged
bottle
might
develop
into
but
this
is
truly
one
beer
id
have
a
hard
time
waiting
for
and
im
very
patient
id
like
to
see
how
the
oxidation
flavors
might
develop
no
data
on
the
bottle
that
i
can
see
about
the
date
i
love
the
sweet
but
not
excessive
fruitly
malt
character
dark
auburn
in
apperance
with
a
nice
head
smell
is
strong
of
sweet
malt
and
citrus
hops
taste
is
big
and
sweet
with
a
hoppy
citrusy
finish
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
nice
not
too
thick
or
carbonated
drinkability
suffers
just
a
touch
for
the
strength
and
noticeable
alcohol
a
very
good
beer
d
pretty
good
overall
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
compared
to
some
of
the
great
american
bws
out
there
this
is
an
exquisite
blend
of
flavors
with
a
great
change
up
what
really
caught
my
attention
was
how
drinkable
this
was
for
a
barley
wine
i
was
really
impressed
that
after
i
finished
the
bomber
off
i
still
wasnt
overcome
by
it
most
bws
are
so
thick
or
sweet
that
a
glass
will
normally
sate
the
palate
but
with
avery
i
wanted
to
crack
another
bomber
i
think
thats
a
pretty
good
testament
to
its
drinkability
certainly
this
isnt
a
beer
youd
slam
in
20
minutes
after
just
getting
home
after
a
long
day
at
work
rather
im
savoring
it
at
3
am
long
after
getting
home
from
a
long
day
at
work
i
think
iike
this
one
the
most
out
of
averys
lineup
poured
into
a
17
ounce
snifter
hog
heaven
is
burnt
orange
in
appearance
with
a
light
beige
foam
crown
large
bubbles
glistening
with
hop
oils
nose
is
extremely
hopforward
fresh
pine
sap
and
the
most
bitter
grapefruit
pith
imaginable
nostrilstinging
in
the
way
that
only
the
most
aggressive
double
ipas
can
be
at
first
the
malt
presence
seems
understated
because
the
hops
are
so
prevalent
in
the
taste
bitter
hop
finish
with
an
eversoslight
mineral
twang
at
the
end
aftertaste
of
pinelaced
grapefruit
rinds
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
thin
for
the
style
which
lends
an
easiness
to
the
drinkability
but
in
the
end
leads
me
to
believe
that
they
just
didnt
put
enough
malt
into
this
beer
there
is
also
a
subtle
oily
slickness
on
the
palate
cannabisflavored
burps
as
it
warms
the
malts
emerge
a
bit
more
with
a
dark
caramel
flavor
but
its
still
insanely
hoppy
overall
it
seems
that
hog
heaven
is
quite
a
bit
off
for
the
style
it
strikes
me
as
more
of
an
dipa
along
the
lines
of
southern
tiers
unearthly
imperial
ipa
although
that
one
has
a
much
thicker
more
syrupy
mouthfeel
lots
of
grey
between
many
styles
i
know
this
is
just
a
good
example
of
the
arbitrariness
of
such
lines
in
any
case
i
enjoyed
this
beer
bottle
poured
a
clear
amber
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
minimal
retention
aroma
of
caramel
sweet
malt
is
omnipresent
with
some
citrus
hops
taste
is
a
mix
between
sweet
caramel
malt
and
some
bitter
hops
alcohol
is
way
too
hot
for
my
liking
and
body
is
definitely
too
thin
for
the
style
im
starting
to
wonder
if
its
just
me
or
are
most
of
avery
beers
a
bit
too
hot
for
their
own
good
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
more
than
a
bomber
of
this
considering
its
pretty
heavy
good
stuff
though
drinkabilty
this
is
delicious
and
satisfying
id
definietly
have
another
22
oz
bomber
in
a
session
in
spite
of
high
abv
i
was
going
to
ding
this
a
half
point
down
on
this
attribute
for
high
abv
affecting
the
sessionablilty
of
this
but
i
simply
cant
just
have
water
before
and
after
and
dont
drink
anything
else
if
you
knock
back
two
or
more
of
these
drinkability
overall
i
found
this
to
ba
a
very
surprising
and
good
barleywine
since
this
has
a
high
abv
and
a
sweet
candy
like
taste
to
it
this
beer
to
me
would
only
be
good
once
in
a
while
may
not
be
be
barleywine
heaven
still
worth
a
try
the
body
is
mid
and
carbonation
is
ok
overall
this
is
a
good
barelywine
but
little
things
could
be
improved
now
if
we
could
just
get
the
pigs
to
land
pretty
enjoyable
but
a
little
too
big
hoppy
to
do
more
than
one
or
suffer
the
consequenses
damn
good
bw
very
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
very
drinkable
indeed
this
brew
is
surprisingly
smooth
and
balanced
extremely
high
abv
is
dangerously
well
hidden
this
brew
is
interesting
and
complex
overall
a
nice
drinkable
beer
the
high
abv
is
pretty
well
hidden
brown
color
with
a
thick
creamy
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
lace
a
nice
piney
strong
smell
comes
out
of
this
a
nice
sweet
hoppy
smell
it
just
doesnt
taste
strong
enough
similar
tasting
to
the
smell
a
little
sweeter
and
the
hop
is
more
smooth
than
i
would
anticipate
a
thick
sweet
syrupy
mouthfeel
more
drinkable
than
a
lot
of
barley
wines
because
it
is
well
balanced
between
hop
and
malt
no
real
alcohol
taste
in
it
which
is
kind
of
surprising
from
the
flavoralcohol
by
volume
man
this
tastes
like
walnuts
mfd
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
smooth
on
the
tounge
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
generated
prickliness
hoppy
as
hell
but
this
is
very
drinkable
like
bigfoot
this
doesnt
taste
like
a
barleywine
but
i
guess
it
is
different
than
a
double
ipa
im
not
sure
i
feel
about
the
blending
of
those
styles
though
pours
a
hazy
dark
amberbrown
color
with
an
inch
of
dense
light
tan
head
light
rings
of
lacing
left
behind
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
toffee
like
with
a
doughy
background
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
up
front
i
didnt
really
smell
much
from
the
hops
but
i
can
taste
them
sweetness
is
taken
over
by
a
spicy
piney
hit
of
hops
the
finish
is
bitter
with
an
alcohol
burn
i
thought
the
abv
would
have
been
a
little
less
noticeable
but
you
can
tell
its
up
there
ive
had
better
barley
wines
good
drinking
with
a
wide
variety
of
flavors
it
doesnt
compare
to
other
better
barleywines
such
as
talon
or
old
horizontal
still
a
fine
offering
there
was
no
best
by
or
packged
on
date
but
ive
had
this
for
atleast
six
months
overall
its
really
difficult
for
me
to
think
of
this
as
a
barley
wine
reminds
me
a
lot
more
of
a
dipa
and
even
though
it
has
elements
i
might
like
in
a
dipa
it
just
doesnt
work
for
me
as
a
barley
wine
having
said
that
the
only
thing
that
really
bugs
me
about
the
beer
after
a
while
is
the
piney
nose
the
rest
of
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
9
2
beer
if
that
element
were
cut
back
i
could
see
this
as
being
something
i
could
come
back
to
again
and
again
drinkabilitymouthfeel
surprising
to
me
i
was
just
a
bit
tipsy
after
drinking
this
monster
22oz
with
abv
of
9
2i
was
afraid
of
the
condition
it
might
put
me
in
so
i
was
saving
for
a
relaxing
night
the
balance
of
malt
and
hops
is
almost
perfecthence
the
very
little
alcohol
taste
and
i
was
very
impressed
with
my
first
from
avery
this
is
definitely
something
that
i
will
pick
up
again
good
beer
interesting
beer
wellcrafted
alcohol
warms
up
quickly
nice
sipping
barley
wine
allinall
worth
the
price
of
admission
a
true
pleasure
to
drink
especially
if
you
like
this
style
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
but
go
easy
as
it
is
strong
cheers
the
smoothness
of
this
beer
and
its
high
abv
make
this
a
great
after
dinner
at
home
beer
bottom
line
good
real
good
check
it
out
this
brew
has
a
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
taste
hints
at
pine
and
mild
fruit
undertones
the
hops
carry
the
flavor
throughout
as
the
malt
is
there
merely
to
keep
the
bitterness
in
check
bears
a
juicy
mouthfeel
that
is
sweet
and
dry
appealing
flavor
that
begins
to
get
sticky
and
resinous
as
it
warms
a
bit
onedimensional
for
a
barley
wine
in
my
opinion
but
this
is
no
slouch
interesting
enough
to
recommend
trying
at
least
once
cheers
tasted
in
a
22
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
belgian
glass
pours
an
amberbrown
color
somewhat
murky
and
impossible
to
see
through
the
glass
the
head
is
white
and
thin
lacing
is
great
smells
mainly
of
hop
and
malt
there
is
a
bit
of
fruit
at
the
end
of
the
whiffcitrus
mainly
nice
balanced
aroma
tastes
very
bitter
sweet
and
heavenly
with
an
added
citrus
tone
this
is
a
nice
full
pleasant
and
balanced
taste
in
the
mouth
hog
heaven
is
full
malty
and
bitter
there
is
a
nice
barley
pull
as
well
good
body
overall
i
would
have
to
say
a
bomber
of
this
stuff
would
be
enough
to
call
it
a
night
very
enjoyable
while
slowly
sipping
and
allowing
for
the
full
taste
and
complexity
of
this
beer
to
emerge
well
done
mouthfeel
is
medium
full
full
enough
to
keep
me
from
downing
this
too
quick
a
good
thing
then
again
if
it
werent
for
the
body
i
would
still
have
to
contend
with
the
waves
of
hops
sugar
and
alcohol
pretty
overwhelming
stuff
good
but
not
sublime
i
could
use
a
little
less
yeasty
funk
but
the
high
hopping
way
high
for
traditional
ideas
about
barleywines
suits
me
just
fine
yeah
hog
heaven
great
name
for
a
barley
wine
im
enjoying
this
style
more
in
more
the
past
few
months
this
one
was
one
of
the
best
i
tried
from
a
flight
at
the
flying
saucer
last
night
however
compared
to
the
bigfoot
the
last
barley
wine
i
tried
it
doesnt
stack
up
thick
and
rich
very
well
balanced
could
age
well
enjoyable
but
i
was
the
only
one
at
the
table
who
would
have
enjoyed
this
pours
a
murky
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
leaving
sticky
lacing
all
around
the
glass
the
smell
of
this
one
is
awesome
it
has
some
caramel
in
the
background
but
mostly
consists
of
citrus
fruits
and
a
very
strong
smell
of
pineapple
taste
starts
out
hoppy
with
combinations
of
pine
and
citrus
fruits
then
hits
you
with
a
subtle
maltiness
finished
with
pineapple
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
truly
feels
wonderful
on
the
palate
would
i
have
another
oh
hell
yes
definately
worth
picking
up
i
will
be
getting
more
as
soon
as
i
can
wow
this
one
is
a
hop
bomb
hard
to
overstate
how
hoppy
this
one
is
from
the
aroma
to
the
aftertaste
this
beer
has
got
some
bite
aroma
is
super
grassy
with
a
piney
aftertaste
no
floral
hop
character
that
i
could
discern
but
you
do
know
this
is
a
higher
alcohol
beer
as
you
drink
it
a
different
barley
wine
you
could
claim
it
was
a
dipa
or
call
it
a
tipa
for
gods
sake
since
i
like
double
ipas
i
liked
this
beer
a
nice
copper
color
that
is
cloudy
in
the
glass
a
white
head
formed
slightly
and
laced
nicely
the
first
scent
is
immense
hop
aromas
with
citrus
scents
being
the
strongest
a
touch
of
malty
sweetness
comes
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
almost
a
reverse
of
the
scent
the
malt
hits
the
palate
and
then
the
hops
begin
to
smash
through
bringing
a
wonderful
hop
flavor
that
stands
out
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
heavy
maybe
a
little
chewy
but
leaves
a
dry
finish
in
the
mouth
this
barleywine
is
solid
the
strong
flavor
anf
the
alchol
content
make
this
sipping
beer
it
most
resembles
a
comfy
food
it
makes
feel
relaxed
warm
and
peaceful
inside
while
drinking
this
wonderful
beer
this
beer
big
as
it
is
seems
to
slide
right
down
the
throat
as
a
bw
this
is
almost
refreshing
hog
heaven
is
one
of
my
favorites
d
very
drinkable
i
like
this
barleywine
and
would
buy
again
yes
it
also
reminds
me
of
a
double
ipa
im
not
too
crazy
about
this
stuff
too
astringent
but
like
i
said
the
astringency
fades
somewhat
as
the
beer
warms
im
confused
how
anyone
could
call
this
brew
a
barleywine
at
9
and
with
this
level
of
hopping
theres
very
little
about
it
that
is
in
any
way
similar
to
any
barleywine
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
double
ipa
period
opinion
i
really
enjoy
this
barley
wine
its
not
just
because
it
is
a
barley
wine
in
a
22oz
bomber
bottle
but
it
really
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
the
hops
are
a
little
big
in
the
finish
for
my
taste
but
i
imagine
that
this
comes
from
the
100ibus
printed
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
old
ruffian
is
about
85ibus
and
i
believe
that
is
a
little
closer
to
what
my
palate
prefers
this
is
still
an
excellent
beer
and
one
that
i
look
forward
to
drinking
again
d
this
reminds
me
of
an
esb
or
double
ipa
more
than
a
barleywine
with
the
amount
of
hops
used
the
malt
aspect
seems
like
an
afterthought
or
a
feeling
from
the
brewer
that
we
have
to
do
this
for
the
style
the
notion
of
balance
is
unfortunately
nonexistent
here
as
a
bit
of
it
would
help
this
beer
be
much
more
palatable
as
a
barleywine
one
of
my
favorite
barley
wine
somewhat
of
a
orangebrown
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
has
some
nice
lacing
this
beer
smells
and
taste
of
hops
and
lots
of
it
i
pick
up
some
grapefruit
a
little
grassy
and
left
with
the
taste
of
hops
and
some
alcohol
goes
down
easy
one
or
two
of
this
bad
boy
is
all
thats
needed
on
most
nights
d
this
is
a
good
beer
i
enjoyed
it
start
to
finish
and
i
will
certainly
buy
it
again
22
oz
bomber
pored
into
a
snifter
this
beer
pours
a
nice
ruby
red
with
a
little
bit
of
orange
highlights
a
nice
white
head
the
fades
away
quickly
with
moderate
lacing
candy
to
my
eyes
the
smell
has
a
strong
alcohol
scent
also
has
some
cherry
and
hops
in
the
background
the
taste
is
piney
has
a
little
alcoholic
taste
as
well
with
some
hops
this
is
my
first
barleywine
so
im
new
to
this
style
but
im
very
interested
in
trying
more
barleywines
this
was
a
nice
introduction
drinkability
22oz
will
be
a
challenge
but
i
am
up
to
it
22
oz
bomber
poured
into
a
tulip
pours
a
dark
mahogany
amber
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
moderate
amount
of
scattered
lacing
aroma
is
a
strong
grapefruit
and
citrus
hops
over
a
slightly
sweet
malt
taste
is
lots
more
hops
strong
resinous
grapefruity
all
over
a
sweet
malt
backbone
with
some
slight
fruitiness
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
barleywine
kind
of
like
a
toned
down
bigfoot
nice
and
drinkable
but
maybe
a
little
overpriced
drinkability
in
the
mold
of
bigfoot
i
find
this
beer
to
be
one
of
the
better
barleywines
out
there
that
is
if
you
dont
mind
a
truckload
of
hops
solid
carbonaiton
and
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
for
a
strong
barelywine
worth
checking
out
imo
amber
colored
with
minimal
head
and
a
little
light
lacing
aroma
is
of
sweet
caramel
malt
with
piney
hops
and
a
slight
hint
of
vanilla
it
is
an
interesting
aroma
although
its
a
little
on
the
light
side
the
taste
echoes
the
sweet
malt
and
piney
hops
but
the
vanilla
and
a
little
oak
is
also
more
present
the
hops
are
strong
but
not
overpowering
this
was
a
little
thinner
than
i
expected
but
not
too
thin
pretty
drinkable
but
it
seems
a
little
more
like
a
dipa
than
a
barleywine
this
beer
is
a
step
in
the
wrong
direction
for
avery
brewing
co
quite
drinkable
for
me
considering
the
9
2
abv
but
i
could
imagine
many
others
finding
this
one
difficult
to
drink
i
however
find
the
overwhelming
hoppines
to
be
a
welcome
respite
from
other
boring
barleywines
i
have
tried
of
late
nice
and
while
not
a
session
beer
i
find
myself
having
to
force
myself
to
slow
down
definitely
worth
a
try
at
a
very
reasonable
price
tag
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
was
as
described
before
watery
but
i
have
had
this
before
and
i
remember
it
having
a
to
style
mouthfeel
on
the
light
end
of
the
style
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
meduim
to
full
bodied
there
is
an
unbalanced
quality
to
the
beer
that
is
not
unpleasant
the
100
ibus
dont
really
taste
all
that
bitter
the
alcohol
is
definately
present
but
i
think
this
adds
to
the
flavor
over
all
a
good
strong
ale
however
i
am
not
certain
about
calling
this
a
barley
wine
d
a
very
tasty
barleywine
not
the
best
but
it
will
keep
you
warm
on
a
cold
winter
day
like
today
if
this
was
on
tap
i
could
probably
handle
2
snifters
but
in
a
bomber
much
nicer
to
share
the
alcohol
is
not
overwhelming
which
keeps
me
wanting
more
but
my
better
judgement
tells
me
not
to
attempt
to
make
this
a
session
beer
therefore
this
beer
rate
too
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
but
it
is
well
worth
a
try
this
is
pretty
drinkable
but
just
misses
the
mark
for
me
id
like
to
see
more
balance
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
barleywine
but
seems
more
like
a
triple
ipa
call
me
crazy
but
i
happen
to
like
a
little
barley
flavor
in
my
barleywine
a
good
looking
amber
crystal
clear
with
not
much
head
good
lace
as
the
level
of
liquid
receeds
smells
and
tastes
like
an
ipa
mostly
pine
hops
slightly
fruity
very
smooth
slightly
oily
with
hop
oil
full
bodied
i
enjoyed
this
one
even
more
the
second
time
around
a
delicious
barelywine
pours
out
a
crystal
clear
rusty
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
that
settles
quickly
leaving
behind
tight
sheets
of
white
lace
aroma
is
mostly
hoppy
citrusy
and
resinous
some
alcohol
and
fruit
juice
in
the
nose
the
flavor
profile
of
this
barleywine
is
awfully
simple
when
it
comes
to
the
malts
mostly
i
just
get
some
vague
malt
sweetness
followed
by
mildly
bittering
piney
hops
note
for
a
100
ibu
beer
this
is
surprisingly
tame
the
mouthfeel
what
the
hell
this
is
so
thin
for
a
barleywine
add
to
this
a
slightly
prickly
carbonation
and
im
starting
to
think
this
is
basically
just
a
higher
abv
ipa
i
will
admit
that
it
thickens
up
slightly
as
it
warms
and
i
allowed
it
to
get
flatter
i
have
no
problem
finishing
a
bomber
of
this
but
i
would
not
ask
for
seconds
dont
really
know
about
this
beer
kind
of
like
it
but
not
so
much
tall
effervescent

constantly

alcohol
warms
the

and
adds

im
buying
more
from
the

poured
a

a
big

aroma
wow
the
graefruit
just
jumps
out
there
than
a
nice
caramel
maltness
comes
thru
flavor
the
grapefruit
is
not
as
strong
as
in
the
aroma
but
it
is
there
up
front
than
the
malt
and
alcohol
got
to
get
more
of
this
another
avery
hoppedup
beer
piney
aroma
good
retaining

looks
like
an
ipa
citrus
carmel
malted

easy
drink
more
ipa
than
barleywine
but
a
forced
marriage
of
the
two
that
allows
one
to
consume
the
100
ibus
thanks
tupalev
d
i
killed
the
bomber
pretty
easily
well
aside
from
getting
a
bit
drunk
a
nice
treat
i
plan
on
buying
at
least
two
bottles
for
my
cellar
at
roughly
five
bucks
a
bomber
this
is
very
wellpriced
for
the
quality
of
barleywine
this
beer
taste
more
like
an
imperial
pale
ale
than
a
bw
this
beer
was
just
awesome
at
cellar
temperature
on
this
47
degree
rainy
latenovember
night
the
ethanol
was
wonderfully
hidden
probably
a
slight
departure
from
the
style
constraints
purchased
at
whole
foods
as
one
of
the
first
barleywines
available
in
nc
pours
a
burnt
orange
with
a
tan
head
which
is
quite
bubbly
and
lively
aroma
was
quit
vineous
and
musty
with
very
strong
malt
character
taste
was
highly
hopped
of
course
and
bittersweet
with
a
one
two
punch
of
malt
and
hop
and
a
long
finish
this
is
very
smooth
and
velvety
definitely
the
barleywines
strong
point
this
a
very
drinkable
barleywine
and
highly
enjoyable
i
could
drink
this
all
day
taste
plenty
of
malt
and
hops
giving
it
a
bittersweet
flavor
the
booze
is
quite
well
hidden
behing
that
bitchslap
of
hops
making
it
pretty
unbalanced
hop
fans
sharing
this
one
with
me
rejoiced
those
who
look
for
equanimity
and
harmony
winced
we
did
all
agree
however
that
this
one
was
more
iipa
than
barleywine
i
gave
it
high
marks
in
appearance
because
of
the
clarity
and
in
drinkability
because
if
i
didnt
know
it
was
a
barleywine
i
would
have
been
content
believing
it
was
an
ipa
my
lower
scores
in
the
other
categories
were
because
it
failed
to
meet
the
style
standards
overall
its
not
the
smoothest
barleywine
style
ale
ive
tried
but
its
a
good
one
that
id
buy
again
in
all
reality
this
brew
is
better
than
some
of
the
scores
it
might
get
just
because
its
not
what
youd
typically
want
or
expect
in
a
barleywine
for
what
its
worth
its
a
great
beer
though
with
so
many
other
barley
wines
out
there
its
hard
for
this
one
to
stand
up
and
be
noticed
not
bad
but
not
outstanding
this
is
an
interesting
interpretation
of
the
barley
wine
style
but
way
out
of
its
league
definitely
a
double
ipa
the
hops
struck
me
as
are
too
bold
for
a
barley
wine
to
me
the
barley
wine
is
big
maltiness
and
subtle
hop
complexity
not
the
other
way
around
had
this
on
tap
at
the
flying
saucer
in
charlotte
the
beer
had
a
clear
reddish
amber
appearance
the
first
whiff
was
a
blast
of
hops
taste
was
of
fresh
hops
very
floral
and
resiny
not
much
malt
to
back
it
up
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
for
a
barleywine
this
could
pass
for
a
dark
ipa
in
my
opinion
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
barleywine
that
tasted
so
much
like
fresh
hops
maybe
this
needs
a
little
bit
of
aging
before
the
brewery
releases
it
im
going
to
buy
a
couple
of
bottles
of
this
drink
one
fresh
and
age
the
other
one
six
months
or
so
to
see
how
it
matures
clear
reddish
orange
colour
almost
bronze
with
a
dense
beige
head
that
receded
quickly
to
a
thin
lace
some
stickage
to
the
glass
made
it
look
pretty
appetizing
us
hops
were
up
front
in
the
aroma
pine
and
citrus
but
there
was
a
nice
balance
of
carameltoffee
malt
and
raisin
to
round
things
out
moderately
strong
bitterness
with
plenty
of
sweetness
to
start
alcohol
earthiness
and
woodoak
came
out
in
the
middle
the
end
showed
some
sweet
fruitiness
caramel
and
a
bit
of
citrus
followed
by
a
medium
dry
bitter
finish
carbonation
was
a
little
on
the
high
side
but
it
was
integrated
well
and
contributed
to
a
creaminess
in
the
texture
there
was
some
astringency
though
as
well
as
some
residual
sugar
and
stickiness
pretty
good
overall
but
it
was
a
little
too
dryastringent
and
the
alcohol
was
just
a
bit
too
forward
in
the
balance
thanks
viggo
cheers
the
grapefruit
citrus
aroma
is
absolutely
heavenly
right
up
there
with
the
aromas
of
bighitters
dreadnaught
masala
mama
the
taste
follows
suit
and
even
with
the
sweet
malt
profile
and
enormous
amount
of
dryhopping
it
is
surprisingly
smooth
i
have
to
say
im
a
bit
surprised
this
isnt
rated
higher
i
know
its
rated
well
but
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
standout
offering
from
avery
more
drinkable
than
any
barleywine
ive
had
to
date
a
hoplovers
barleywine
all
the
way
but
it
should
please
the
tastebuds
of
any
ba
i
just
wish
this
nectar
were
available
in
my
home
state
pours
a
deep
amber
with
minimal
head
smells
of
honey
raisins
and
resiny
hops
tastes
much
the
same
as
it
smells
nice
malty
base
for
the
hops
to
come
in
and
clean
house
but
the
hops
are
much
more
subdued
than
i
expected
and
certainly
does
not
taste
anywhere
near
100
ibus
not
as
complex
as
i
would
have
imagined
very
smooth
and
drinkable
the

not
a
bad
beer
but
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
either
not
highly
quaffable
and
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
but
pretty
tasty

at
all
but
was
missing
something
cheers
drinkability
definitely
cellar
material
it
would
be
interesting
to
try
this
after
the
hops
have
mellowed
still
i
enjoyed
the
hops
its
just
a
touch
too
one
dimensional
for
this
style
had
to
knock
off
some
points
for
that
but
nothing
off
or
bad
about
this
beer
just
more
ipalike
than
barleywine
try
one
fresh
then
cellar
one

a

taste
starts
off
with
the
potent
hops
piney
but
not
overwhelming
and
transitions
nicely
into
tropical
fruits
pineapple
mango
and
apricots
finishing
with
a
hearty
caramel
malt
backbone
alcohol
is
definitely
present
but
not
overwhelming
especially
as
it
warms
and
gets
sweeter
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
coating
with
bubbly
refreshing
carbonation
not
quite
as
flavorful
as
new
glarus
but
still
a
tasty
barley
wine
as
my
palate
becomes
more
accustomed
to
hops
im
finding
myself
enjoying
this
style
quite
a
bit
ive
got
a
2001
old
crusty
in
the
fridge
calling
my
name
well
done
in
all
respects
halfway
through
the
bomber
im
catching
the
buzz
but
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
these
down
two
at
a
time
no
freshness
date
minimal

thats
snowwhite

leaving
some

22

around
aroma
is
citrusy
floral
piney
and
resiny
with
caramel
and
toasted
bread
undertones
slightly
one
dimensional
but
good
nonetheless
taste
begins
with
a
nice
hop
assault
that
is
reminiscent
of
their
ipa
but
slightly
amplified
with
citrus
specifically
orange
and
grapefruit
and
resiny
pine
sap
hops
flavors
followed
by
toasted
bread
and
caramel
malt
flavors
that
balance
the
bitterness
with
sweetness
the
finish
is
bitter
but
not
overwhelming
and
prevents
the
sweetness
from
overpowering
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
thick
body
but
too
much
carbonation
for
a
barleywine
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
an
american
barleywine
but
this
brew
is
somewhat
onedimensional
in
taste
and
doesnt
have
enough
of
a
malt
balance
or
a
a
complexity
of
a
hop
profile
taste
is
quite
balanced
i
tend
not
to
like
barleywines
when
theyve
goneaged
too
sweet
this
has
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
that
but
it
is
still
tastes
like
a
sweeter
barleywine
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overpowering
finishes
pretty
dry
id
definately
buy
this
again
very
inviting
on
all
ends
ive
been
sitting
on
this
bottle
for
about
a
year
now
and
its
still
got
got
enough
to
it
to
impress
its
character
is
perfect
for
a
spicy
food

curried
chicken
and
rice
all
the
way
throw
down
for
it
you
wont
be
dissapointed
an
average
american
barley
wine
flavors
are
honest
but
uncomplicated
not
worth
revisiting

thanks
gabe
this
beer
had
none
of
the
thickness
or
stickiness
i
was
expecting
and
i
am
having
a
hard
time
considering
it
a
barley
wine
that
said
even
if
i
were
to
call
it
a
dipa
i
would
still
have
to
say
it
was
damned
good
beer
is
good
happy
beering
tast
started
a
little
to
bitter
from
the
hops
but
as
the
beer
warmed
up
the
balance
shiined
through
weird
the
bottle
states
to
keep
it
refridgerated
its
better
when
it
warms
big
malt
flavors
hints
of
brown
sugar
cherry
apples
and
pears
then
the
hops
follow
that
up
and
leave
a
nice
bittering
aftertaste
on
the
tongue
finishes
smooth
and
warming
quite
nice
pouring
with
a
copperyred
body
this
barley
win
has
a
thin
wispy
head
the
smell
is
mostly
a
very
sweet
malt
with
an
edge
of
alcohol
and
some
subtle
hops
creeping
in
about
the
edges
taste
was
very
similar
smooth
and
malty
but
with
the
alcohol
a
lot
more
noticeable
than
in
the
aroma
a
subtle
hops
bitterness
without
much
of
the
rest
of
the
hops
flavor
leaving
a
slight
dry
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
carbonated
for
a
barley
wine
but
not
unpleasant
fairly
drinkable
and
a
good
barley
wine
great
blend
of
juicy
citrus
hop
flavor
and
aroma
mixed
with
malty
alcohol
the
dark
ruby
color
gives
a
slight
rose
tint
to
the
frothy
head
the
alcohol
is
strong
but
mixed
in
with
the
flavor
profile
true
west
coast
style
barleywine
one
of
the
best
out
there
it
will
leave
our
taste
buds
numb
for
about
half
a
day
so
dont
plan
on
drinking
anything
exciting
later
on
the
taste
was
a
smooth
mix
of
vanilla
toffee
grapefruit
raisins
peat
smoke
and
mango
the
thick
juicy
body
coated
the
tongue
with
each
sip
and
allowed
these
flavors
to
linger
alcohol
was
evident
but
not
overpoweringly
so
warm
and
soft
when
sipped
gingerly
but
a
bit
stinging
if
gulped
a
beer
good
enough
to
be
included
among
the
upper
echelon
of
american
barleywines
in
my
opinion
lacks
the
intense
hop
punch
of
bigfoot
old
ruffian
or
old
crustacean
but
makes
it
up
with
suave
mellow
demeanor
making
it
more
approachable
i
like
smelling
it
more
than
drinking
it
splitting
this
bomber
with
a
worthy
companion
my
glass
is
filled
with
a
lovely
sanguinous
ale
this
scarlet
hue
is
so
damn
inviting
big
malts
and
sweet
caramel
with
some
toffee
greet
my
nasal
passage
and
are
blessed
by
citrous
and
spicy
hops
its
100
ibus
are
immediately
apparent
in
the
nose
big
alcohol
flexes
its
muscle
in
the
aroma
flavor
is
much
more
balanced
than
i
would
have
expected
based
on
the
smell
of
course
the
big
malt
bill
makes
itself
known
with
smoothness
and
sweetness
sugar
and
caramel
are
there
and
do
not
go
away
spicy
hops
attempt
to
mutiny
but
are
turned
back
some
citrous
comes
in
but
is
also
put
down
by
the
malts
warm
alcohol
has
the
last
say
but
the
sweetness
carries
though
into
the
finish
interestingly
enough
hops
have
the
last
say
with
a
citrous
aftertaste
hell
of
a
brew
to
split
with
a
fellow
ba
thanks
unionmade
ill
stick
to
the
storm
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
awesome
it
has
a
rich
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
along
with
a
killer
hop
aroma
that
is
really
bitter
and
floral
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
warm
rich
malt
base
with
a
very
bitter
hop
flavor
and
aftertaste
it
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
dry
and
hoppy
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
barley
wine
but
ive
had
better
the
aroma
is
great
it
really
has
quite
a
hoppy
character
the
taste
is
more
hops
than
malts
though
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
overall
an
excellent
brew
i
would
say
its
more
of
an
american
strong
like
arrogant
bastard
than
barleywine
but
however
its
classified
it
is
yummy
ill
be
coming
back
to
this
in
the
future
cheers
drinkability
a
little
closer
to
a
malty
douple
ipa
than
is
typical
for
the
style
but
nonetheless
an
exceptional
beer
this
is
a
very
drinkable
barley
wine
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
style
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
it
i
highly
recommend
it
its
a
real
nice
amber
copper
color
i
like
to
think
that
it
has
more
of
a
red
color
than
copper
but
what
do
i
know
first
off
the
smell
is
really
sweet
i
can
smell
the
malt
balanced
out
very
well
by
the
hops
but
only
a
hint
of
hops
there
are
also
hints
of
citrus
caramel
and
other
scents
that
im
not
really
in
tune
with
the
mouthfeel
leaves
something
to
be
desired
the
high
alcohol
content
gives
it
a
harsh
fell
that
i
dont
like
overall
for
being
my
first
barleywine
i
am
now
a
fan
of
barleywines
but
if
they
all
have
this
harsh
mouthfeel
i
dont
see
myself
going
out
of
the
way
to
hunt
these
down
nice
low
froth
of
initial
largebubbled
chilly
white
foam
and
plentiful
cirocumulus
cloud
lacing
vermillion
ruby
red
hue
with
just
a
hint
of
oozy
action
in
a
crystal
quiet
lake
closer
to
an
imperial
ipa
in
hop
bouquet
but
the
equally
huge
malt
helps
to
balance
it
a
little
all
adding
to
an
anticipated
alcohol
crank
fruit
flora
hop
bunch
explodes
in
mouth
but
it
magically
dissipates
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
craisin
sweetness
lighter
on
the
tongue
than
many
other
barleywines
in
total
far
less
sticky
and
alcohol
doesnt
run
roughshod
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
some
ruby
glints
in
the
light
nicesized
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
smell
is
definitely
of
rasins
caramel
hops
and
pured
alcohol
taste
is
somewhat
nutty
again
with
the
raisins
and
caramel
and
a
light
sourdough
baguette
flavor
hops
and
malt
dominated
again
by
the
alcohol
complexity
increases
as
the
ale
warms
hints
of
plum
and
citrus
begin
to
become
evident
the
mouthfeel
was
peppery
and
smooth
with
a
bit
of
oilyness
not
extremely
drinkable
though
as
one
was
almost
more
than
enough
for
me
im
not
sorry
i
tried
it
but
it
wont
be
a
frequent
purchase
for
me
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
amber
color
that
shows
a
beautiful
copper
hue
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
is
topped
by
a
frothy
cream
to
tan
colored
head
that
has
been
generated
by
the
low
level
of
carbonation
in
this
beer
the
aroma
is
thick
and
concentrated
with
aromas
of
candied
citrus
fruits
alcohol
strawberries
and
lightly
toasted
biscuits
this
beer
has
a
light
sweet
with
definite
notes
of
caramel
and
citrus
it
is
fairly
light
on
the
palate
especially
for
a
barlywine
this
beer
has
a
fair
amount
of
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
as
well
as
a
bit
of
astringent
earthy
woody
hops
this
is
not
quite
as
explosively
hoppy
as
i
was
hopping
and
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
hot
and
evident
in
the
finish
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
malt
presence
here
the
sweet
caramel
malt
notes
help
to
accentuate
the
citrus
hop
notes
in
the
end
though
i
am
once
again
a
bit
disappointed
in
another
avery
big
beer
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
cloudy
icedtea
amber
with
bright
cherry
highlights
spotty
head
mostly
just
a
ring
immediate
smells
of
huge
grapefruit
mixed
with
strong
pine
notes
and
some
sweet
caramel
malt
that
intensified
as
it
came
up
to
room
temperature
taste
was
a
whopper
as
its
smell
forecast
huge
hop
flavors
dominated
big
citrus
flavors
mainly
grapefruit
coupled
with
the
massive
taste
of
pine
also
quite
spicy
not
as
malty
as
i
wouldve
expected
at
first
but
as
it
warmed
big
sweet
caramel
flavors
began
to
show
through
this
stuff
really
tasted
more
like
a
super
ipa
than
a
barleywine
but
nonetheless
still
a
solid
beer
overall
it
tasted
like
an
overthetop
celebration
abv
creeps
up
on
you
and
can
begin
to
be
tasted
and
felt
as
it
warms
but
its
hidden
pretty
well
mouth
is
thick
rich
and
full
big
and
chewy
heavy
duty
a
fine
example
of
an
american
barleywine
with
that
west
coast
taste
comments
if
you
dislike
hops
look
elsewhere
hopheads
rejoice
this
is
my
first
experience
w
avery
a
bit
of
a
surprise
but
i
will
buy
this
and
their
others
in
the
future
22
ounce
bottle
no
dating
on
label
some
alcohol
was
present
in
the
aroma
and
some
in
the
flavor
but
for
the
most
part
it
was
restrained
in
the
beer
drinkability
a
very
interesting
barleywine
worth
the
try
for
posteritys
sake
id
have
it
again
beyond
that
i
really
dug
this
brew
from
avery
it
porued
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
very
thick
frothy
head
that
left
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
nice
and
sweet
with
alot
of
malt
citrus
and
woody
scents
the
flavor
was
quite
nice
with
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
in
the
beginning
then
it
opened
up
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
followed
by
a
fruity
finnish
and
aftertaste
that
tasted
like
alchoholic
pinapple
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
one
i
would
definantly
buy
again
from
a
twentytwo
ounce
bottle
with
cute
little
flying
pigs
on
the
label
pours
a
clear
deep
earth
color
moderate
but
respectable
creamcolored
head
and
simple
lacing
the
aroma
is
forceful
mashing
of
alcohol
hops
raisins
plums
toasted
grains
citrus
and
malt
smells
just
like
a
barleywine
shouldand
a
hoppy
one
at
that
a
rich
thick
sweetness
is
in
the
front
of
the
taste
with
a
powerful
bitterness
to
back
it
up
warming
is
present
immediately
fruit
qualities
continue
through
the
taste
along
with
a
fleeting
yeastiness
this
is
an
enjoyable
decidedly
westcoast
barleywine
very
nice
this
is
one
of
the
best
balanced
and
most
drinkable
examples
of
this
style
i
love
barleywines
and
found
this
one
delicious
however
i
think
it
could
use
some
more
malt
to
balance
out
all
the
hops
from
what
im
reading
on
the
bottle
this
sounds
to
be
right
up
my
alley
100
ibus
9
2
abv
and
2
12
pounds
of
columbus
dry
hops
in
every
barrel
i
went
with
a
standard
shaker
pint
on
this
one
and
it
poured
out
beautifully
the
body
is
a
perfectly
translucent
rubybrown
i
dont
get
much
of
a
head
out
of
it
but
what
is
there
does
stick
stoicly
both
to
the
top
of
the
beer
but
as
well
as
to
the
glass
creating
rings
of
lace
moving
the
glass
around
wafts
the
hop
aromas
right
up
my
nose
and
the
glass
isnt
even
close
closer
inspection
of
the
nose
reveals
the
sweet
caramelly
malt
as
well
as
a
great
hop
aroma
they
portray
pine
citrus
rind
and
im
also
picking
up
some
woodytannic
notes
on
the
nose
the
beer
feels
a
bit
light
on
the
palate
as
i
begin
to
drink
it
the
malts
do
register
staunchly
with
notes
of
toffee
and
caramel
as
well
as
a
simple
sugary
sweetness
the
bitterness
is
the
concrete
foundation
for
the
hop
flavors
that
emerge
later
the
hops
come
across
predominately
as
grapefruit
and
citrus
rind
im
also
picking
up
some
more
of
those
tannic
notes
in
the
flavor
and
i
wonder
if
this
beer
is
spending
any
time
in
wooden
barrels
the
alcohol
presence
is
very
light
for
its
large
abv
in
all
honesty
this
beer
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
arrogant
bastard
but
it
has
its
own
characteristics
as
well
definately
a
good
beer
pick
it
up
when
you
see
it
unfortunately
the
year
this
was
bottled
isnt
dated
im
guessing
it
was
bottled
fairly
recently
though
hog
heaven
is
ruby
red
in
color
with
an
really
thin
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
very
strong
of
west
coast
hops
citrusy
mainly
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
of
this
beer
the
flavor
seemed
really
hopped
for
a
barley
wine
at
least
compared
to
the
handfull
that
ive
had
this
tastes
strongly
of
citrusy
hops
winey
malty
flavor
is
primarily
noted
in
the
beginning
of
a
sip
vanilla
flavor
is
noted
just
a
slight
taste
of
alcohol
is
also
present
this
is
very
complex
the
different
tastes
mix
well
together
and
the
high
hoppiness
makes
this
beer
stand
out
i
guess
this
is
a
barley
wine
for
hopheads
a
great
barleywine
served
on
tap
in
a
little
12oz
goblet
tulip
glass
at
the
moan
and
dove
my
fav
place
appears
a
nice
rusty
russet
amber
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
bubbly
head
smell
is
a
huge
boquet
of
fruityness
piney
hops
and
malty
sweetness
the
taste
is
definately
more
hops
than
malt
which
i
find
to
be
refreshing
in
a
barleywine
nice
move
piney
bitterness
yet
theres
that
juicy
fruity
ripeness
that
makes
this
style
so
awesome
fruity
malts
are
the
backbone
of
this
beer
but
they
take
a
back
seat
to
the
expressive
hops
dry
finish
and
great
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
a
great
barleywine
thats
not
overpowering
at
all
oink
oink
ok
that
was
lame
22oz
bomber
ive
had
this
one
hanging
around
for
about
10
months
now
so
i
figured
it
was
time
to
give
it
a
shot
there
is
somewhat
of
a
ruby
tint
to
the
amber
color
it
is
a
touch
hazy
mine
had
a
large
offwhite
head
that
subsided
quickly
the
aroma
is
nice
there
is
the
typical
malty
sweetness
but
there
are
definitely
notes
of
hops
here
mainly
grapefruit
to
the
nose
but
also
some
grassiness
tastes
good
a
rich
malty
sweet
body
but
the
sweetness
is
nicely
balanced
by
the
hops
slight
taste
of
grapefruit
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
too
very
nice
drinkability
high
abv
and
not
enough
malty
balance
make
this
an
easy
one
and
done
seems
to
be
too
hoppy
for
the
style
nice
honey
ruby
color
with
a
bit
of
head
and
no
lace
smell
is
a
very
sweet
natural
brown
sugar
smell
with
a
ton
of
hops
and
some
malts
behind
no
yeast
smells
apparent
the
taste
is
initially
very
sweet
even
a
bit
too
sweet
but
it
really
evens
out
when
the
hops
comes
in
there
is
tons
of
hop
bitterness
with
very
little
else
besides
the
overriding
sweetness
on
the
top
the
taste
is
more
natural
tasting
that
some
beers
like
it
had
raw
cane
sugar
or
something
of
the
like
the
mouthfeel
feels
thicker
than
it
is
because
of
the
sweetness
but
the
dryness
and
bitterness
of
the
beer
takes
this
down
a
bit
pretty
good
barleywine
i
would
say
although
the
flavors
are
a
bit
harsh
and
could
use
a
bit
of
cellaring
to
mellow
perhaps
poured
a
nice
mahogony
red
color
with
an
almost
yellow
head
the
smell
was
boozy
and
hoppy
with
notes
of
rich
mollassas
alcohol
and
malts
the
taste
was
almost
like
a
double
ipa
with
huge
juicey
hop
notes
and
a
warming
alcohol
presence
this
was
certainly
a
quality
barleywine
and
i
would
have
no
misgivings
about
drinking
a
couple
of
these
ok
im
not
much
of
a
barleywine
fan
to
begin
with
but
this
stuff
is
aok
it
pours
a
musty
dark
ameber
with
a
minimal
whitish
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
and
i
was
concerned
that
that
would
translate
into
a
taste
that
was
too
alcoholic
but
i
was
surprised
theres
a
bit
od
hop
balance
in
this
bw
yes
there
is
a
syrupy
undertone
bit
the
taste
generally
is
balanced
and
smooth
some
prunes
and
pines
there
too
medium
body
and
drinkable
for
a
heavy
content
ale
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
a
great
barleywine
pours
amber
with
a
very
nice
head
and
lacing
smell
is
good
but
mainly
citrus
hoppy
not
many
malt
notes
of
the
typical
barleywine
tatse
likewise
is
more
like
an
ipa
with
just
a
hint
of
some
portlike
elements
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
harsh
which
impacts
drinkability
might
be
better
placed
as
a
strong
ipa
from
a
22oz
bomber
poured
into
a
chalice
this
beer
was
a
brown
to
amber
it
was
reasonably
clear
and
poured
with
a
decent
1
inch
head
that
quickly
receded
into
the
glass
the
head
did
leave
a
fairly
thick
lace
hanging
off
the
side
the
nose
has
strong
floral
accents
from
the
hops
a
bit
of
citrus
to
back
that
along
with
just
a
touch
of
the
alcohol
it
really
smells
like
a
big
ipa
the
taste
has
the
same
floral
and
citrus
character
that
is
in
the
nose
along
with
some
sweetness
i
expected
more
of
an
alcohol
burn
but
its
pleasantly
mild
just
a
touch
of
candylike
sweetness
from
some
malt
a
slick
light
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
it
has
a
nice
warm
feeling
without
burning
through
the
taste
this
beer
came
to
me
a
dark
copperruby
color
crystal
clear
and
carbonated
the
head
that
was
produced
off
white
to
light
brown
in
color
thick
rich
bubbly
and
decently
sticky
kind
of
like
cappuccino
coffee
head
lace
was
very
present
sheets
in
places
and
intricate
in
other
places
visually
a
decent
beer
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
a
combination
of
bittersweet
malts
and
bitter
hops
citrusy
and
piney
more
hops
then
malts
citrus
fruits
lemon
grapefruit
pine
tree
spices
light
and
alcohol
notes
tastes
were
mostly
a
combination
of
different
hops
bitter
grapefruity
piney
etc
malts
were
somewhat
noticeable
some
sweetness
tad
roasted
in
the
middle
light
spices
combination
of
hops
and
fresh
some
warming
alcohol
notes
but
finished
with
more
hops
aftertaste

hops
body
was
on
the
full
side
especially
as
it
warmed
my
opinion
of
this
beer
was
more
of
an
ipaimperial
then
barleywine
but
incredibly
smooth
creamy
warming
and
very
drinkable
but
with
a
9
2
abv
this
beer
will
take
you
out
and
fast
but
what
a
way
to
go
if
you
want
a
good
example
of
a
barleywine
this
is
not
my
first
choice
but
it
would
come
up
in
an
imperial
ipa
conversation
taste
was
pretty
typical
for
a
barleywine
raisonly
hints
of
other
fruit
possibly
plum
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
had
a
slight
harshness
to
it
that
seemed
to
mellow
a
bit
as
it
warmed
up
an
upper
tier
bw
id
definitely
buy
another
bottle
of
this
one
not
something
ill
be
dreaming
about
at
night
but
a
lot
better
than
most
out
there
pours
a
deep
red
color
with
some
brown
hints
with
a
lightly
tan
head
that
falls
to
ring
of
foam
hops
dominate
nose
floral
orange
peel
light
pine
resin
in
the
background
on
top
of
malt
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
wonderful
hops
very
good
smelling
beer
juicy
inviting
hops
you
can
feel
the
hops
starting
to
attack
the
tounge
before
you
even
taste
them
starts
out
with
a
good
malt
depth
then
light
hop
flavors
start
to
mingle
in
my
mouth
after
you
swallow
a
hop
bitterness
begins
to
build
on
your
tounge
but
it
takes
a
few
seconds
to
taste
the
tary
pine
resin
mouthfeel
is
very
solid
a
nice
barley
wine
drinkability
is
great
a
good
example
of
an
american
barley
wine
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
can
see
buying
more
of
them
my
first
avery
brew
and
a
good
one
at
that
definitely
a
hop
lovers
dream
green
grassy
hops
dominate
doesnt
have
quite
the
malt
backbone
of
the
sierra
nevada
or
the
rogue
but
it
is
still
a
very
enjoyable
brew
more
of
a
double
ipa
than
a
barley
wine
imo
but
certainly
worth
a
try
for
all
the
hop
heads
out
there
good
stuff
grab
a
bomber
if
you
find
it
the
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
red
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
cover
the
beer
the
nose
is
big
theres
tons
of
malt
sweetness
in
there
and
some
nice
earthy
hops
with
a
dose
of
the
alcohol
coming
through
as
well
the
flavor
is
not
as
big
as
the
nose
says
it
is
there
a
nice
caramel
sweethenss
balanced
with
a
very
earthy
hop
the
aftertaste
is
really
nice
sweet
and
bitter
this
beer
is
nice
and
thick
for
a
big
beer
this
has
a
really
good
drinkability
i
dig
it
a
great
brew
too
bad
i
only
have
two
bottles
of
this
left
in
the
cellar
curious
pretty
unsatisfying
and
overall
eh
good
barleywine
curious
to
see
how
it
ages
the
sheer
size
of
the
bottle
is
a
turn
off
but
i
guess
it
makes
for
a
1
beer
night
i
wanted
more
but
i
suppose
that
it
was
a
good
thing
that
i
shared
the
22oz
bomber
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
crisp
and
smooth
at
the
start
and
the
bitterness
rides
the
tongue
long
after
swallowing
a
nice
slow
drinking
brew
but
the
22
oz
bottle
is
a
turnoff
for
this
style
the
9
2
abv
is
barely
detectable
until
the
end
when
a
faint
bit
of
warmness
spreads
across
the
tongue
finish
is
quite
bitter
though
im
not
sure
if
100
ibus
is
correct
no
hint
of
barley
wine
here
this
is
pure
imperial
ipa
good
beer
and
ill
have
it
again
but
as
far
as
style
consistancy
i
cant
agree
very
upfront
in
flavour
raisinbread
flavour
pretty
sweet
with
not
enough
bitterness
or
dryness
to
balance
it
out
the
finish
is
short
and
feels
empty
not
very
hoppy
in
flavour
for
a
beer
that
claims
to
be
highly
hopped
well
thats
just
what
i
thought
anyway
not
my
bag
overall
a
good
baryleywine
style
ale
this
came
in
a
22oz
bomber
with
an
interesting
picture
of
pigs
flying
on
the
label
this
one
pours
a
clean
amber
orange
color
with
great
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
is
excellent
the
hops
are
there
and
the
barley
wine
sweet
maltiness
is
present
a
bit
of
pine
and
fruit
also
come
through
very
nice
this
one
starts
of
tasting
of
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
fruity
the
hops
then
kick
in
with
some
bitterness
and
the
slight
taste
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
a
very
tasty
and
balanced
barleywine
with
good
mouthfeel
and

i
had
no
problem
finishing
off
the
22
ounce
bomber
but
given
the
weight
of
this
guy
i
wouldnt
really
call
it
drinkable
i
liked
it
very
much
and
will
certainly
include
this
with
the
other
barleywines
i
keep
coming
back
to
oink
oink
drinkable
brew
more
subtle
than

alcohol
really
shows
up
at
the
end
a
real
belly
warmer
almost
seemed
a
smidge
hop
heavy
but
a
solid
barleywine
nonetheless
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
could
go
so
far
as
to
call
this
a
refreshing
barleywine
and
you
thought
that
was
an
oxymoron
pours
a
light
orange
syrupy
pour
a
thin
head
dissolves
into
a
tiny
ring
around
the
top
of
the
glass
a
heartpounding
aroma
some
malts
grapefruit
rinds
even
alcohol
presence
detected
on
the
nose
quite
inviting
the
alcohol
is
noted
off
the
cuff
very
rich
and
extremely
slick
intense
bellywarming
feeling
even
at
the
top
hops
burn
the
palate
followed
by
a
burnt
malt
backbone
the
body
reveals
some
nice
flavorings

caramel
roasted
malts
and
my
first
taste
of
columbus
dry
hops
and
are
they
tasty
massively
ugly
label
but
a
handsome
beverage
on
tap
at
the
blind
tiger
nyc
poured
dark
almond
and
cloudy
ruby
notes
nice
lacing
hoppy
nose
medium
bodied
hops
are
up
front
grainy
and
resiny
and
rich
malt
backbone
comes
onto
palate
later
for
balance
this
is
a
very
drinkable
bwine
very
tasy
and
enjoyable
wish
we
could
get
this
much
more
often
on
the
east
coast
seek
this
one
out
and
enjoy
clear
reddish
copperybronzy
hue
with
a
vague
peachy
highlight
it
is
an
attractive
color
the
offwhite
head
reached
a
modest
finger
in
height
before
quickly
fading
to
a
bubbly
collar
the
subsequent
lacing
was
minimal
and
very
patchy
the
nose
was
boldly
hoppy
obviously
this
is
an
american
barleywine
i
detect
nothing
englishtraditional
about
it
behind
the
juicy
citrus
and
piney
hops
was
a
weak
note
of
toasty
malt
im
in
love
with
the
aromas
of
the
hops
it
is
mouthwatering
with
its
invitation
will
the
palate
live
up
to
the
hype
created
by
the
nose
the
palate
is
a
load
wow
it
staggers
the
senses
with
flavor
both
the
massive
hops
bitterness
and
flavor
and
the
burning
alcohol
angrily
vie
for
the
focal
point
of
this
beer
who
wins
both
they
both
kicked
my
tongues
ass
the
hoppiness
was
very
flavorful
raw
pine
needles
grapefruit
and
lime
zest
and
fleshy
citrus
too
it
is
amazingly
dry
and
raw
at
the
finish
what
the
malt
brings
to
the
table
flavorwise
is
frankly
little
the
toasty
carameltoffee
sweetness
is
weak
in
comparison
to
the
alcohol
heat
it
burns
so
sweet
i
really
like
the
flavor
construction
on
this
beer
it
is
huge
unbalanced
forceful
but
very
tasty
granted
i
couldnt
nor
would
i
want
too
drink
this
everyday
i
found
the
mouthfeel
to
be
indifferent
id
say
it
is
mediumfull
in
bulk
modest
carbonation
but
there
is
nothing
noteworthy
about
the
physical
impression
it
could
be
fuller
maybe
even
rounder
yes
id
like
more
malt
the
alcohol
is
not
hidden
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
i
think
this
is
on
par
with
old
crusty
bigfoot
or
arrogantdouble
bastard
if
you
enjoy
any
of
those
beverages
seek
this
one
out
if
you
dont
like
any
of
those
beers
avoid
hog
heaven
i
purchased
a
22ounce
bottle
in
loveland
i
wish
i
had
another
very
tasty
with
an
interesting
array
of
complex
flavors
this
is
what
i
think
a
good
barleywine
should
be
served
from
a
22oz
bomber
nice
flying
pig
artwork
pours
out
a
brownishcopper
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
and
longlasting
lacing
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
hoppy
smells
more
like
a
double
ipa
than
a
barleywine
taste
is
full
of
columbus
hops
very
distinct
right
away
after
the
hops
you
do
get
a
good
dose
of
malt
more
than
i
expected
from
the
nose
a
nice
sweet
caramely
character
that
carries
through
to
a
subtly
bitter
finish
spicy
notes
and
alconhol
become
more
apparent
as
the
hog
warms
up
a
bit
body
isnt
very
heavy
at
all
for
a
barleywine
but
the
sweetness
would
make
it
tough
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
definitely
a
different
barleywine
i
give
credit
for
uniqueness
22oz
bomber
no
freshness
date
i
love
the
label
on
this
bottle
flying
pigs
love
it
poured
a
deep
and
clear
amber
with
a
thick
and
generous
head
that
retains
well
and
provides
some
serious
lacing
nice
big
hop
aroma
which
seems
to
be
the
trend
in
bws
lately
if
this
continues
i
may
designate
this
as
my
favorite
style
it
seems
to
be
coming
in
very
close
to
the
super
hopped
imperial
ipas
on
second
pour
the
bready
malt
aroma
rears
itself
its
warming
now
and
coming
alive
with
great
aromas
the
body
on
this
is
quite
full
and
smooth
the
bittering
hops
are
noticable
in
the
finish
which
is
also
just
a
tad
dry
theres
a
sweet
caramel
malt
flavor
also
that
is
blending
superbly
with
the
hop
onslaught
the
carbonation
is
even
not
too
sharp
or
flat
overall
i
found
this
an
exceptional
brew
one
i
would
buy
often
if
only
it
were
available
locally
drinkability
a
very
overthetop
west
coast
barleywine
ill
have
to
try
the
normal
formulation
for
comparison
ive
heard
good
things
about
it
drinakability
is
good
so
much
like
an
ipa
could
drink
several
thanks
goes
out
to
gusler
for
the
avery
samples
this
beer
needs
some
time
and
even
then
this
thing
is
much
more
of
a
double
ipa
it
lacks
any
sense
of
malt
even
young
bigfoot
has
some
regardless
i
had
no
problem
enjoying
it
there
are
few
beer
styles
to
which
i
havent
taken
an
immediate
liking
loved
over
the
top
with
hops
ipa
right
away
stygian
black
imperial
stouts
no
hesitation
but
barley
wine
is
one
style
at
which
ive
had
to
work
to
develop
an
appreciation
perhaps
that
is
why
i
was
so
taken
with
hog
heaven
as
it
seems
to
bridge
or
perhaps
defy
a
strict
classification
as
a
barley
wine
big
malty
sweetness
edging
into
belgian
territory
with
a
rock
candy
sweetness
offsetting
this
to
perfection
was
an
aggressively
pungent
piney
hops
bittering
im
amazed
that
the
high
degree
of
sweetness
in
the
beer
was
not
cloying
but
somehow
they
managed
to
balance
the
act
this
could
almost
be
put
in
the
strong
ale
or
imperial
ipa
category
with
the
show
of
big
hops
but
that
would
seem
inappropriate
for
the
malt
profile
very
much
an
inyourface
beer
and
yet
most
drinkable
this
is
very
hoppy
it
has
a
big
aroma
and
a
sweet
finish
theres
a
good
balance
but
its
more
of
a
big
ipa
than
a
barleywine
instead
of
the
essence
of
a
barleywine
it
seems
to
have
the
flavors
of
an
ipa
with
just
the
hint
of
strength
like
an
i2pa
would
as
big
of
a
beer
as
it
is
that
actually
make
it
an
impressive
brewing
feat
this
beer
poured
a
murky
copper
color
with
a
head
that
fit
it
perfectly
the
smell
is
strong
on
the
hops
dept
which
seemed
odd
for
a
barleywine
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
syrupy
sweetness
but
that
soon
fades
to
a
citric
flavor
thats
not
quite
tart
hops
are
there
the
whole
time
and
are
really
strong
in
the
finish
the
body
seems
a
little
thin
but
it
is
well
carbonated
at
the
same
time
this
one
was
quite
good
and
definitely
a
must
buy
for
hop
heads
who
want
to
try
a
barleywine
orange
body
with
almost
no
head
i
make
an
effort
to
pour
straight
and
a
small
head
quickly
disappears
to
let
a
sticky
ring
surround
the
glass
big
and
intense
hop
aroma
i
dont
know
if
thats
typical
to
columbus
hops
but
it
pretty
much
reminded
me
of
sweat
which
the
first
sip
confirmed
in
mouth
im
very
disappointed
with
the
weak
palate
i
expect
more
from
a
beer
with
that
much
ingredients
although
the
hop
flavors
intensity
are
just
overpowered
and
remove
from
the
complexity
on
the
other
hand
the
malts
are
there
to
calm
down
those
100
ibus
and
ensure
a
good
drinkability
but
where
is
the
body
overall
very
tasty
but
with
some
glitches
i
couldnt
really
tolerate
especially
in
a
barley
wine
this
seemed
more
of
a
double
ipa

is
for
sure
of
the

i
havent
been
too
impressed
they
just
dont
pull
it
off
very
well
i
am
equally

in
this

as
i
was

salvation

very
hoppy

some
grassy

the
flavor
is
surprisingly
smooth
for
the
high

the

dont
carry
through
as
strongly
into
the
flavor
but
the
taste

sweet

really
enjoyed

yet
the

leaves

hop
flavors
bury
the
alcohol
completely
this
barley
wine
is
less
malty
than
i
expected
the
dominant

characteristics
do
more
than
just
reveal
that
just
is
a
west

good
but
just
not
great
bottom
line
for
me
and
others
in

this
beer
was
the
highlight
in
a
night
of
incredible
beer
one
of
the
very
best
barleywines
in
the
world
tasting
this
makes
me
long
dearly
for
availability
of
avery
products
i
had
in

just
dont

an
overdose
this
is
a
beer
that
is

it

im
embarrassed

quickly
i

favorite
of

solutions
this
was
a
decent
barley
wine
that
hid
its
alcohol
content
very
well
it
definitely
did
not
seem
to
have
the
100
ibus
that
the
label
claims
while
good
there
are
many
other
beers
of
this
style
that
i
would
choose
over
this
one
there
was
nothing
special
about
this
one
to
help
it
stand
out
in
the
crowd

a
very
nice
looking

the
residual

an
exceptional
amount
of

full

nose
with
lots

the
drinker
and
the
hoppy
malt
flavor
follows
with
lots

alcohol
warmth
this
is
a
lovely
thick
and
heavy
beer
that
would
be
quite
warming
on
a
cold
winters
night
but
was
a
bit
over
the
top
on
this
90
degree
day
this
is
slow
sipping
beer
that
needs
to
be
served
with
due
regard
for
its
abv
as
it
quite
smooth
and
easy
going
down
f
poured
a
deep

sticky
this
is
a
uncompromising
beer
herenutty
and
somewhat
medicinal
with
a
hugely
dry

quite
a
beer
here
maybe
a
little
overwhelming
never
heard

living
in

for
awhile
had
never
seen

this
is

6oz
bottle
i
cracked
it
open
and
gave
it
a
pour
and
it
looked
great
it
was
a
dark
red
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
lasted
a
little
bit
this
was
the
best
part
of
this
beer
i
took
a
wiff
and
was
turned
off
by
the
hoppiness
it
tated
pretty
much
like
it
smelled
however
at
9
2
it
tasted
better
as
the
1pt6oz
went
down
it
was
easier
to
consume
the
farther
into
the
beer
you
got
i
would
not
get
another
one
however
not
my
kind
of
brew
overall
impression
a
heavy
hoppy
beer
if
you
like
columbus
hops
this
is
it
if
you
like
complex
malty
barley
wines
keep
looking
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
though
while
heavy
hops
the
over
all
impression
isnt
bad
but
doesnt
enter
into
the
good
category
in
my
humble
opinion

to
it
from

overall
the

profile
strikes
me
as
rather

they

on
this
one
malt
sweetness
shines
through
for
a
brief
moment
and
then
is
completely
overwhelmed
i
only
bought
this
bottle
a
few
months
ago
so
perhaps
aging
for
a
year
or
two
would
mellow
this
beer
out
a
bit
excellent
barley
wine
i
highly
recommend
it
i
personally
found
it
to
be
best
at
5560
degrees
fahrenheit
i
cant
say
enough
about
the
quality
of
this
beer
i
hope
all
bas
get
a
chance
to
try
this
notquiteasharshasusual
barleywine
and
see
if
they
agree
with
my
assessment
do
yourself
a
favor
and
find
a
good
shaped
glass
to
drink
it
in
it
really
does
help
a
large
red
wine
glass
is
actually
good
one
with
a
closed
in
top
sort
of
like
a
brandy
snifter
but
not
so
round
in
the
middle
the
front
is
sweet
and
somewhat
fruity
the
middle
is
buttery
malty
full
there
is
alcohol
in
this
beer
the
finish
is
a
very
hoppy
hopped
hoppiness
and
bready
there
is
an
interesting
subtle
licorice
aftertaste
this
beer
has
all
the
good
flavors
of
a
barleywine
plus
the
strong
hops
plus
that
creamy
taste
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
obvious
in
taste
the
hops
are
inyourface
but
not
as
much
as
say
the
bigfoot
2003
im
going
to
go
back
and
buy
another
one
of
these
to
cellar
im
guessing
one
year
will
be
perfect
for
this
beer
to
decide
how
to
balance
itself
a
little
better
mediumamber
in
color
with
slight
chillhaze
forms
a
sticky
dark
beige
head
atop
small
to
mediumsized
bubbles
after
a
vigorous
pour
lacing
is
excellent
retention
is
good
and
carbonation
is
mild
aroma
is
intensely
dryhopped
for
a
barleywine
with
herbal
grassy
columbus
hops
and
caramelized
sugary
malts
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
malts
start
to
predominate
in
aroma
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
firm
body
taste
begins
with
a
big
surge
of
green
earthy
flavor
hops
followed
by
a
brief
metallic
note
and
leading
into
the
thick
sticky
caramelized
malts
dark
fruit
flavors
are
minimal
the
lightly
dry
finish
is
wellbalanced
with
subtle
toasted
grain
notes
nicely
complementing
the
rather
mild
in
potency
but
harsh
in
mouthfeel
longlasting
leafy
bitterness
the
alcohol
is
never
noticeable
as
it
warms
the
hops
mellow
out
and
the
beer
takes
on
a
better
balance
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
prefer
my
barleywines
with
more
balance
i
e
more
malt
with
dark
fruit
character
and
less
hops
well
worth
a
try
it
pours
amber
with
a
fairly
thick
tan
head
that
leaves
traces
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
almost
all
hops
with
a
noticeable
aroma
of
alcohol
and
just
a
trace
of
grapefruit
underlying
the
hops
in
a
somewhat
strange
turn
the
malt
is
quite
noticeable
at
first
but
seems
to
diminish
as
the
beer
warms
unfortunately
this
allows
the
hops
to
knock
everything
out
of
balance
leaving
just
hops
pronounced
alcohol
and
cloying
sweetness
to
finish
things
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
as
others
have
said
this
beer
is
reminiscent
of
a
highly
hopped
ipa
deep
cloudy
garnet
in
color
nose
is
good
but
i
wish
they
would
have
done
a
little
more
with
it
doesnt
do
this
beer
justice
the
taste
is
very
well
balancedbig
on
the
hoppyness100
ibus
but
the
sweetness
follows
to
clean
in
up
with
a
nice
dry
hoppy
finish
i
love
it
when
pigs
fly
pours
a
cloudy
burnt
sienna
color
with
a
fairly
dense
tan
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
to
14
inch
leaving
a
clingy
lace
looks
like
fresh
apple
squeezings
very
hoppy
floral
aroma
earthy
malts
piney
great
hop
presence
on
the
tongue
alcohol
mollasses
suprisingly
sweet
with
a
perfect
hop
bite
thin
mouthfeel
with
light
to
medium
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
but
the
alcohol
is
definitely
there
to
slow
you
down
some
pours
a
nice
light
reddish
mahogany
color
with
a
thin
white
head
with
many
large
bubbles
strong
aroma
of
fresh
grass
and
floral
hopsalmost
overwhelming
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
the
taste
notes
of
crisp
lemon
and
citrus
sweet
malts
and
pine
resin
are
all
present
up
front
with
a
blast
of
bitter
hops
to
follow
along
with
a
warming

abv
the
most
disappointing
thing
about
this
brew
is
the
fact
that
its
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
other
than
that
i
really
like
it
hog
heaven
is
a
barleywine
boasting
9
2
abv
and
100
ibus
right
on
the
label
this
is
no
ordinary
beer
as
i
pour
i
noticed
very
little
carbonation
but
huge
clouds
of
fresh
grassy
herbal
hop
aroma
are
pouring
out
of
my
glass
nice
color
but
no
real
head
which
is
somewhat
the
norm
for
barleywines
on
first
taste
you
very
briefly
sense
some
sweetness
but
it
is
quickly
and
brutally
overwhelmed
by
the
2
5lbs
of
columbus
hops
they
pour
into
each
barrel
the
body
is
oddly
thin
and
essentially
flat
which
only
serves
to
amplify
the
main
focus
of
this
beer
hops
i
started
drinking
this
one
cold
and
let
it
warm
along
the
way
the
only
real
change
i
noticed
was
i
could
detect
the
alcohol
presence
more
when
warmer
if
you
dont
like
hops
give
this
one
wide
berth
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
its
nice
exposition
of
our
bittering
friend
but
i
think
i
would
like
it
more
with
at
least
a
little
more
carbonation
and
body
the
beers
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
color
with
an
antaean
head
the
consistency
frothy
and
the
resident
lace
thick
sticky
sheets
that
weld
themselves
to
the
glass
quite
a
big
hit
of
the
hop
flowers
fusel
alcohol
and
a
lemon
lime
crispness
that
tries
unsuccessfully
to
hide
the
9
2
abv
front
is
malt
and
somewhat
sweet
the
top
skinny
in
feel
with
the
finish
masterfully
acidic
and
titanicaly
hopped
the
aftertaste
alcohol
bitter
and
long
lasting
meant
for
the
lovers
of
robust
high
alcohol
beers
as
it
is
a
really
belly
warmer
and
one
that
will
take
the
hide
off
an
armadillo
hooyeah
i
am
really
liking
these
higherabv
beers
now
that
they
are
available
in
ohio
the
aroma
floodgates
were
opened
from
the
minute
i
cracked
this
one
open
strong
hops
with
barley
malt
in
the
background
very
pretty
amber
hue
with
a
medium
beige
head
and
some
lacing
very
malty
flavor
with
some
caramel
dry
hoppy
finish
with
alcohol
notes
very
good
beer
that
left
me
with
a
pleasant
buzz
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
strong
hop
aroma
decent
malty
body
with
alot
of
hops
think
ruination
i
cant
rate
this
to
style
so
i
am
going
with
my
taste
at
what
point
does
ibu
turn
a
barleywine
into
an
imperial
ipa
i
dont
know
but
this
stuff
is
excellent
hazy
deep
amber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
mildly
carbonated
with
thick
lace
that
throughly
coats
the
glass
though
the
head
is
small
it
retains
fairly
well
a
pungent
aroma
of
grapefruit
rind
is
noticeable
in
the
aroma
several
feet
from
the
glass
pine
sap
is
also
prominent
along
with
sweet
fruit
notes
upon
tasting
sweet
malts
initially
dominate
but
are
swiftly
overlaid
by
the
massively
bitter
grapefruit
hops
the
sweet
molasseslike
character
of
the
malt
lingers
on
as
an
undercurrent
to
the
taste
quelled
but
never
vanquished
throughout
the
taste
there
are
also
various
fruit
notes
which
rise
and
fall
melon
raisins
berries
and
others
though
the
alcohol
content
of
this
beer
is
high
even
for
a
barleywine
alcohol
notes
seem
to
have
only
a
minimal
impact
upon
the
taste
but
after
drinking
half
a
glass
the
presence
of
the
alcohol
cannot
be
doubted
to
be
handled
with
due
discretion
it
is
an
intriguing
beer
with
some
critical
flaws
easily
my
favorite
beer
that
i
rated
less
than
4
oh
my
god
this
is
near
perfection
in
a
beer
im
a
huge
hophead
and
if
i
could
ever
imagine
what
hop
juice
tastes
like
this
beer
would
be
it
not
a
huge
head
on
this
one
although
what
head
sticks
around
laces
the
glass
a
bit
dark
amber
in
color
the
aroma
is
identical
to
the
taste
hops
the
lable
states
that
2
5
pounds
of
columbus
hops
are
used
in
each
barrel
and
believe
me
i
can
taste
every
ounce
of
them
although
the
beer
boasts
an
ibu
rating
of
100
you
could
never
tell
it
is
hoppy
tasting
but
not
in
a
bitter
way
this
beer
is
definaty
on
my
list
to
purchase
again
dark

along
with

lightly
buttery

the
taste
falls
a
bit
short
of
the
promise
of
the
aroma
unfortunately
hop
bitterness
dominates
the
flavor
profile
while
generic
caramel
malt
sweetness
provides
contrast
complexity
in
overall
malt
character
was
thus
lacking
slightly
toasty
malt
indicates
a
small
proportion
of
munich
malt
in
the
grist
light
in
body
for
a
barleywine
hop
flavor
is
identical
to
the
hop
nose
being
citrusy
herbal
and
piney
columbus
is
a
beautiful
american
hop
although
overall
depth
in
flavor
was
a
bit
lacking
hog
heaven
exhibits
excellent
drinkability
finishes
very
clean
with
a
bittersweet
combination
of
caramel
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
slowly
fading
hog
heaven
is
reminescent
of
an
imperial
ipa
barleywine
hybrid
and
seems
more
apt
of
an
american
strong
ale
label
dangerous
drinkability
all
right
if
you
are
a
hophead
this
is
going
to
be
great
beer
with
its
100
ibus
and
2
5
lb
barrel
columbus
dry
hop
if
however
you
are
a
malt
man
you
might
be
a
little
disappointed
this
beer
poured
out
a
dark
ambercopper
color
with
a
small
white
head
it
left
some
lace
aroma
of
malt
hops
and
some
alcohol
present
the
taste
had
some
citrus
slightly
sweetmaybe
carmel
alcohol
and
malt
presence
some
elements
of
an
ipa
this
is
my
first
barleywine
so
is
hard
for
me
to
measure
against
others
review
may
change
later
due
to
this
with
obvious
sediment
floating
around
there
are
a
couple
things
of
note
in
the
aroma
high
caramel
malt
presence
and
a
high
hop
presence
bitterness
perceived
probably
from
the
columbus
dry
hop
first
taste
is
very
pleasant
for
100
ibu
this
is
not
as
bitter
as
i
thought
it
would
be
of
course
it
may
have
settled
down
over
time
as
well
taste
is
actually
more
sweet
than
bitter
very
nice
though
there
are
not
a
lot
of
obtrusive
tastes
in
this
bw
this
is
highly
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
this
has
a
great
sweet
malt
backbone
it
has
some
bitterness
but
not
over
the
top
at
all
nice
subdued
fruity
esters
great
barleywine
while
it
is
probably
not
my
favorite
see
sierra
nevada
it
is
probably
the
most
easy
drinking
barleywine
ive
had
thanks
to
jaybeerman
for
the
sample
pours
a
beautiful
brown
coating
with
a
very
thin
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
into
the
abyss
of
fine
barleywine
aroma
gives
off
a
phenomenal
smell
of
pure
barleywine
wood
sweet
figs
and
slight
alcohol
the
flavors
replicate
the
aromatic
qualities
very
well
along
with
toffee
and
raisins
by
grace
this
is
a
delicious
beer
this
is
just
a
tad
below
cigar
citys
leon
but
a
cut
above
steel
toes
lunker
both
worldclass
bourbon
barrel
barleywines
in
my
book
very
impressive
coming
out
of
a
brewery
that
is
well
known
for
ipa
centric
beers
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
having
a
12
and
09
vintage
the
fresher
bottle
was
much
better
a
beer
that
really
does
live
up
to
its
hype
leon
was
better
than
this
to
me
tasted
a
lot
like
aaron
best
bw
i
have
ever
tasted
amazing
didnt
expect
this
quality
from
an
ipa
powerhouse
very
rich
smooth
and
lightly
toasted
vanilla
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
o
not
sure
why
this
is
classified
as
an
american
barleywine
seems
like
an
english
style
through
and
through
good
flavor
profile
and
well
balanced
but
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
overpowering
starting
to
oxidize
and
the
bourbon
was
much
less
than
i
expected
a
good
offering
and
worth
trying
but
not
in
my
top
echelon
of
king
henry
cognac
church
on
a
hill
sucaba
and
mother
of
all
storms
a
little
more
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
likes
this
one
seems
to
fly
under
the
radar
a
bit
its
amazing
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
people
talk
about
people
should
talk
about
it
more
pour
is
extremely
dark
burgundy
with
a
small
amount
of
tight
tan
head
nose
has
some
light
bourbon
notes
up
front
chocolate
maltiness
with
figs
and
raisin
taste
is
bright
and
tight
bourbon
is
subtle
but
helps
balance
the
malt
sweetness
figs
and
raisin
play
a
strong
role
with
chocolate
and
dark
malt
presence
with
berry
notes
caramel
and
brown
sugar
in
back
full
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
very
creamy
inviting
palate
dark
red
pour
with
a
slight
head
smell
of
slight
bourbon
and
dark
fruits
quite
appealing
taste
is
smooth
as
silk
with
the
dark
fruits
and
slight
bourbon
finish
body
isnt
even
that
thick
honestly
its
really
creamy
and
so
smooth
damn
tasty
probably
the
best
barrel
aged
barleywine
in
existence
definitely
worth
the
hype
so
great
worth
the
hype
trade
for
it
now
overall
alpine
great
very
much
reminds
me
of
kuhnhenn
ba
4d
great
is
also
reminicent
of
really
fresh
mother
of
all
storms
i
think
that
alpine
great
is
not
an
american
barleywine
rather
it
is
more
of
a
cross
between
a
barrel
aged
english
barleywine
and
a
barrel
aged
old
ale
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
huge
and
flavorful
my
recommendation
is
to
split
a
12
bottle
with
a
friend
because
6oz
of
great
is
enough
for
one
sitting
o
an
american
barleywine
that
drinks
more
like
what
an
english
barleywine
does
little
american
hop
flavours
come
out
yet
its
just
enough
to
make
it
interesting
importantly
it
balances
out
the
sweet
malts
that
would
otherwise
make
it
too
cloying
great
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
overall
reminds
me
of
jw
lees
not
a
ton
of
bourbon
but
it
does
allow
the
base
beer
to
shine
o
fantastic
beer
one
of
those
rare
beers
that
i
take
the
first
sip
and
literally
say
wow
easily
in
the
top
handful
of
barleywines
ive
ever
had
well
worth
the
wait
a
must
try
thanks
again
socalbrewlvr
overall
this
was
outstanding
awesomeness
in
a
bottle
the
flavor
could
use
a
touch
of
bitterness
to
help
balance
the
overwhelming
sweetness
but
in
small
doses
this
isnt
an
issue
at
all
im
also
surprised
this
was
just
aged
in
jack
daniels
barrels
and
there
was
no
use
of
maple
anything
in
its
creation
wonderfully
flavorful
and
decadent
with
an
impressive
non
boozy
feel
to
go
with
it
a
real
treat
thanks
again

probably
wont
age
well
unctuous
stands
out
among
the
very
best
barrel
aged
barleywines
or
barrel
aged
beers
ive
had
overall
a
very
good
barleywine
from
alpine
that
is
sweeter
than
most
and
best
enjoyed
as
a
sipper
to
relish
in
all
that
flavor
very
sweet
at
first
but
this
beer
gets
better
sip
by
sip
and
is
definitely
worth
seeking
out
cost
10
99
for
a
12
oz
bottle
verdict
a
very
delicious
barrel
aged
barleywine
from
alpine
and
certainly
the
first
non
ipa
ive
found
to
be
a
home
run
from
them
the
alcohol
is
hidden
expertly
well
and
the
flavors
are
quite
sensational
a
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
name
honestly
one
of
the
best
beer
of
the
year
for
me
and
top
10
all
time
so
damn
good
i
am
very
happy
i
traded
for
this
puppy
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
toffee
bourbon
and
wood
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
caramel
and
toffee
syrup
and
bourbon
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
really
smooth
bourbon
presence
in
the
flavor
that
makes
this
one
very
easy
to
drink
t
opens
with
a
rich
wave
of
caramel
toasted
brown
sugar
toffee
and
light
bourbon
booze
soaked
raisin
chocolate
light
plum
and
a
slight
woody
dryness
mouthfeel
is
slightly
oily
and
slick
never
becoming
too
heavy
really
hard
to
find
much
of
the
14
here
to
me
this
is
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
amazing
stuff
taste
is
amazing
slightly
thick
texture
very
smooth
and
nice
semi
sweet
taste
i
cant
taste
14
alcohol
this
is
very
well
balanced
the
smell
and
taste
compliment
each
other
i
thought
about
trading
some
bottles
but
after
drinking
2
so
far
ive
decided
to
keep
the
rest
this
beer
is
awesome
best
barleywine
ive
had
alpine
beer
company
thank
you
o
what
an
amazing
beer
i
keep
going
back
to
smell
the
beer
but
the
actual
taste
and
mouthfeel
on
this
sucker
is
unreal
this
thing
doesnt
need
any
age
on
it
at
all
its
ready
to
drink
now
so
smooth
and
layered
thanks
again
to
jzeilinger
for
opening
this
one
with
me
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
hazy
brown
color
the
head
comes
and
goes
rather
quickly
no
real
retention
or
lacing
on
this
one
the
beer
smells
sweet
like
caramel
with
a
bit
of
barrel
aging
on
the
nose
the
hops
are
a
bit
hidden
on
this
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
also
sweet
with
a
subtle
bitterness
in
the
finish
flavors
of
caramel
and
toffee
in
there
with
a
minimal
bitterness
i
was
hoping
to
get
more
of
the
jd
barrel
flavors
from
this
but
wasnt
able
too
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
very
dangerous
because
its
easy
to
drink
overall
its
a
good
brew
really
happy
i
got
to
try
it

o
overall
great
is
great
had
this
one
sidebyside
with
king
henry
wooden
hell
ba
hifi
batch
2
ba
old
ruffian
and
this
was
my
clear
favorite
o
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
american
barleywines
i
much
prefer
their
english
brethren
that
said
alpine
great
blew
me
away
this
was
an
absolute
treat
as
always
thank
so
much
alex
drink
a
very
good
bw
but
just
not
up
to
par
with
some
of
the
heavy
hitters
we
busted
out
last
night
cheers
o
unsure
which
vintage
i
sampled
but
i
felt
this
beer
was
falling
off
and
peaking
already
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
barleywine
that
carries
barrel
aging
that
way
i
like
it
the
base
beer
is
truly
the
showcase
here
in
my
opinion
all
too
often
the
barrel
overwhelms
and
swallows
the
base
beer
in
a
bb
barleywine
in
this
case
the
base
is
the
star
and
the
barrel
lays
a
gentle
subtle
layer
the
melds
wonderfully
not
big
brash
or
boozy
in
fact
if
this
beer
truly
clocks
in
at
14
its
a
gem
subtlety
and
grace
thy
name
is
great
this
is
a
bold
brew
with
a
solid
inclusion
of
alcohol
it
is
full
bodied
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
super
easy
drinking
for
a
big
bold
brew
that
isnt
hiding
its
abv
level
it
was
well
put
together
and
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
for
comparison
purposes
with
others
in
the
style
it
really
isnt
totally
fair
to
make
this
comparison
but
considering
the
lack
of
availability
and
inflated
asking
price
of
this
brew
nowadays
id
much
rather
take
some
gratitude
taste
is
a
bit
oxidized
but
still
sweet
and
malty
some
diacetyl
as
well
slight
bitterness
and
a
crisp
finish
its
quite
tasty
but
a
bit
good
overall
i
absolutely
loved
this
beer
it
definitely
lived
up
to
the
hype
for
me
they
got
such
a
great
balance
between
the
barrel
and
beer
characters
and
both
of
them
together
were
just
awesome
the
low
carbonation
high
abv
combo
really
worked
well
for
me
as
well
extremely
flavorful
smooth
and
relatively
balanced
beer
at
its
size
and
strength
its
definitely
a
sipping
beer
but
it
lived
up
to
its
name
for
me
it
just
may
be
a
new
favorite
of
the
style
for
me
o
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
maybe
a
bit
too
much
abv
overall
so
far
this
is
the
best
barleywine
i
have
had
enough
said
o
mellow
and
complex
o
a
very
rich
and
potent
barleywine
the
low
carbonation
works
very
well
with
the
strong
flavors
aside
from
the
slight
oxidation
this
beer
would
be
near
perfect
thanks
again
shawn
o
really
drinkable
awesome
flavors
balanced
and
nicely
integrated
barrel
more
barrel
characteristics
than
some
of
the
recent
alpine
bal
releases
like
ba
token
if
you
were
wondering
probably
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
of
the
year
o
really
nice
beer
wish
it
came
in
bigger
bottles
no
complaints
on
this
one
o
a
stunner
from
alpine
that
i
really
enjoyed
sipping
on
the
alcohol
is
nonexistent
on
the
nose
and
palate
which
boggles
my
mind
an
excellent
barley
wine
from
the
one
of
the
best
hopproducing
breweries
out
there
that
says
a
lot
a
musttry
d
a
very
good
barrelaged
barleywine
that
doesnt
quite
crack
the
top
tier
for
me
ill
revisit
this
when
i
drink
my
own
bottle
generously
sent
by
arthurpendragon
before
his
untimely
demise
alcohol
is
shockingly
wellhidden
which
makes
this
a
very
dangerous
brew
i
will
be
haunted
by
this
beer
the
rest
of
my
autumn
and
winter
life

pours
a
golden
reddish
amber
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
glorious
the
aroma
is
bursting
with
vanilla
coconut
caramel
some
light
alcohol
marshmallow
as
well
as
some
bourbon
the
initial
taste
is
some
sweet
caramel
followed
by
some
oaky
bourbon
marshmallow
toffee
and
vanilla
all
the
flavors
come
together
quite
nicely
the
finish
has
a
slight
alcohol
burn
but
nothing
unexpected
given
the
abv
mediumfull
body
no
carbonation
it
could
use
slightly
more
carbonation
but
it
is
certainly
amazing
the
way
it
is
easily
one
of
the
best
barley
wines
have
had
reviewed
from
notes
back
in
late
june
on
tap
at
brewery
into
6oz
tulip
no
head
whatsoever
but
has
a
creamy
eggshell
ring
medium
brown
color
with
a
grapefruit
pink
hue
very
refreshing
on
the
nose
with
a
great
amount
of
caramel
malt
sweet
and
salty
candies
butterscotch
with
a
nice
alcohol
presence
taste
is
very
similar
alcohol
didnt
burn
me
that
much
the
caramel
and
grapefruit
came
out
more
mouthfeel
was
decent
a
tad
too
much
carbonation
for
my
tastes
as
i
have
always
enjoyed
smoother
barleywines
still
abc
comes
through
once
again
with
another
magnificent
brew
o
one
of
abcs
best
offerings
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
i
love
this
stuff
very
happy
i
got
to
try
this
made
a
trip
out
today
with
the
girlfriend
just
to
get
away
from
home
and
am
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
they
tapped
a
keg
today
highly
recommended
and
worth
seeking
out
this
is
what
kuhnhenn
bbbw
wants
to
be
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
outstanding
barrel
aged
barleywine
definitely
up
there
as
one
of
the
best
ive
had
amazing
nose
up
there
with
moas
as
one
of
my
favorite
barrel
aged
barleywines
and
id
love
to
get
another
bottle
of
it
overall
about
4
oz
of
this
beer
is
plenty
enough
for
me
for
a
barleywine
i
was
impressed
even
flat
probably
wont
put
too
much
effort
to
find
this
again
unless
its
on
tap
o
this
is
probably
about
the
6th
or
7th
serving
i
have
had
at
the
pub
2
were
2005
and
the
rest
09
everytime
i
thought
it
would
be
the
last
time
i
had
it
for
a
long
time
and
then
when
i
walk
in
and
see
that
name
on
the
board
i
get
giddy
my
favorite
barrel
aged
barleywine
o
a
very
interesting
barleywine
i
highly
recommend
it
if
youre
a
fan
of
this
style
thanks
to
steve
for
this
pours
an
ugly
murky
dark
brown
a
light
tan
watery
head
forms
a
ring
but
thats
it
really
wonderful
dr
pepper
malts
reminds
me
of
a
kuhnhenn
bbbw
taste
is
not
as
successful
as
the
nose
lots
of
dark
fruits
raisins
but
it
finishes
with
lots
of
bourbon
but
its
too
hot
and
the
bourbon
tastes
cheap
the
feel
is
a
touch
to
thin
and
little
hot
wanted
to
love
this
but
its
a
bit
overrated
this
is
one
bottle
id
really
love
to
get
a
chance
to
try
again
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
is
a
bit
of
a
sipper
but
that
is
just
fine
by
me
every
sip
seems
to
get
better
as
you
go
down
the
bottle
too
bad
that
alpine
doesnt
distribute
in
this
area
i
have
a
feeling
i
may
not
get
a
chance
to
have
another
one
but
i
will
be
seeking
this
out
thanks

o
my
personal
favorite
of
the
night
a
fantastic
barleywine
that
should
be
able
to
stand
up
to
any
and
all
competition
i
still
have
a
bottle
ill
be
looking
at
opening
up
next
to
the
other
ba
barleywines
i
still
have
to
taste
i
expect
it
will
look
forward
to
the
challenge

pours
a
fairly
pretty
light
brown
almost
no
he
on
this
one
smells
super
bourbon
heavy
tons
of
heavy
oak
and
vanilla
on
the
nose
tastes
thick
and
sweet
a
touch
of
hops
on
the
back
lots
of
sweet
maltiness
with
a
nice
oak
on
the
tongue
the
vanilla
on
the
tongue
is
solid
as
well
overall
one
of
the
best
american
barley
wines
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
ive
ever
had
othis
beer
is
nothing
short
of
its
namesake
o
a
rather
unique
beer
lots
of
complexity
yet
still
candylike
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
tasting
this
beer
and
hope
to
come
across
it
again
one
day
o
this
brew
has
a
ton
of
flavor
and
a
ton
of
complexity
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
is
a
little
heavy
on
the
boozy
quality
i
was
excited
that
this
beer
might
have
some
jd
qualities
too
it
but
not
in
that
cheesy
way
like
fridays
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
a
touch
hazy
but
maintains
a
nice
amber
color
and
actually
for
the
first
time
in
awhile
is
one
of
the
ba
barleywines
that
has
a
head
on
it
the
aromatics
of
this
particular
beer
are
heavy
with
oak
and
vanilla
but
rather
mild
on
the
bourbon
aspects
this
allows
for
the
butterscotch
and
caramel
which
reign
supreme
on
the
palate
of
this
beer
to
come
through
in
the
nose
as
well
there
is
a
background
flavor
that
i
actually
love
when
i
detect
it
in
higher
abv
beers
toasted
marshmallow
some
have
said
almond
but
im
sticking
with
my
guns
on
this
one
it
really
wraps
up
the
flavor
on
this
smooth
drinking
beer
overall
this
beer
might
get
lost
in
a
giant
tasting
like
this
one
but
i
guarantee
if
you
have
a
bottle
all
to
yourself
you
are
truly
not
going
to
want
to
share
it
dontcha
just
love
the
modest
beers
this
one
pours
a
very
lightly
murky
rubyamber
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
dirty
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
toffee
graham
crackers
light
walnut
butterscotch
and
a
vague
sense
of
alcohol
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
tasty
same
though
the
butterscotch
and
alcohol
come
through
a
bit
more
pronounced
than
before
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
syrupy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
very
tasty
bwine
my
only
real
criticism
was
that
the
barrels
really
didnt
impart
as
much
bourbon
character
as
id
hoped
despite
this
though
this
comes
through
as
one
damn
fine
barleywine
straight
up
o
one
of
the
best
american
barleywines
available
overall
the
most
drinkable
beer
at
this
abv
alpine
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
and
they
killed
it
with
this
beer
after
having
it
on
tap
last
year
i
had
high
hopes
for
the
bottle
and
it
delivered
this
beer
had
way
too
much
of
a
buttery
toffee
thing
going
on
to
be
anything
great
finish
it
off
with
a
cheap
whiskey
barrel
and
this
is
what
you
get
the
beer
pours
a
rusty
brown
color
into
my
westvleteren
chalice
there
is
a
small
head
that
rises
up
and
fades
to
a
ring
a
lot
of
caramel
notes
with
some
toffee
and
oak
that
is
nice
quite
a
full
body
with
carbonation
that
you
can
feel
easily
for
the
high
amount
of
alcohol
it
drinks
quite
easily
and
i
would
recommend
this
again
d
this
one
i
really
liked
it
was
a
pleasure
to
try
and
share
it
is
totally
a
sipper
but
i
may
have
drank
this
one
faster
because
i
liked
it
so
much
a
must
try
the
flavor
matches
both
the
aroma
and
the
name
of
this
beergreat
dusted
chocolate
becomes
more
pronounced
as
does
a
big
vanilla
bourbon
presence
from
the
jack
daniels
barrels
a
bit
green
on
the
finish
with
some
earthy
hops
and
booze
as
well
as
a
hint
of
sherry
and
cardboardlike
oxidation
still
im
guessing
that
this
beer
has
held
up
fairly
well
and
the
alcohol
is
nicely
hidden
for
the
abv
great
is
a
slow
sipper
and
hopefully
one
i
get
a
chance
to
sip
again
pours
cherry
brown
with
very
little
head
comprised
mostly
of
a
thin
white
ring
around
the
top
smells
of
brown
sugar
caramel
booze
and
a
hint
of
hops
smell
is
very
strong
but
good
it
is
quite
sweet
in
the
taste
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
enjoy
this
beer
pretty
warm
as
straight
out
of
the
cellar
it
finishes
with
the
reminder
of
the
flavor
of
ham
which
is
unappealing
the
people
i
enjoyed
this
beer
with
called
me
crazy
but
acknowledged
that
the
smoky
brown
sugar
sweet
finish
my
allude
to
some
honey
ham
once
the
beer
warmed
more
i
was
completely
able
to
get
over
this
issue
and
really
enjoyed
the
beer
it
is
very
thick
and
heavy
in
the
mouth
with
low
carbonation
but
disguises
the
abv
really
shockingly
well
the
drinkability
is
not
limited
by
alcohol
flavor
but
instead
intensity
and
its
thick
body
ultimately
i
held
this
beer
to
the
highest
of
standards
because
i
thought
when
i
acquired
it
that
this
might
become
my
favorite
barleywine
ever
to
that
it
did
not
live
up
to
is
this
a
really
good
beer
though
heck
yes
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
try
this
one
thanks

bourbon
oak
vanilla
sherry
caramel
toffee
and
malty

taste
is
a
bit
boozy
but
barrles
mellowed
this
out
nicely
full
body
well
carbonated
should
age
well
d
my
favorite
of
the
three
bourbon
barrelaged
barleywines
i
realized
after
the
fact
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
the
lead
off
for
this
beer
is
a
medium
body
of
malt
sweetness
and
some
bourbon
comes
into
the
picture
in
the
early
midpalate
region
there
is
a
nice
caramel
toffee
flavors
that
come
from
the
bourbon
and
malt
complementing
each
other
and
the
finish
is
good
with
a
moderate
oakiness
the
carbonation
on
the
palate
is
low
and
the
feel
of
the
beer
is
creamy
with
a
nice
finish
again
probably
the
most
complex
beer
i
had
the
entire
beer
week
as
far
as
total
flavor
notes
involved
very
glad
to
have
had
it
alpine
is
impressing
me
for
sure
drinkability
i
didnt
love
this
beer
the
14
0
is
definitely
here
affecting
the
appearance
and
the
carbonation
level
is
a
little
low
even
for
a
beer
this
chunky
and
chewy
that
being
said
theres
a
lot
to
like
here
and
i
did
enjoy
it
the
aroma
was
pretty
fantastic
and
the
flavor
profile
pretty
robust
and
complex
on
the
whole
its
a
mixed
bag
and
im
not
sure
its
worth
the
10
99
that
was
on
the
cap
though
maybe
itd
be
different
fresh
gimme
some
bolder
hop
notes
a
little
more
lift
and
i
think
this
one
would
be
stellar
essentially
give
it
to
me
fresh
pours
a
dark
impenetrable
yet
clear
mahogany
brown
color
with
a
quickly
receding
initially
two
finger
thick
tan
head
unsurprisingly
the
head
isnt
long
for
this
world
and
leaves
little
trace
behind
aroma
and
flavor
are
both
exceptionally
sweet
overly
complex
and
subtly
balanced
the
nose
leads
off
with
a
strong
boozy
whisky
and
vanilla
aroma
with
softer
notes
of
figs
raisins
plums
brown
sugar
caramel
and
sweet
malts
body
is
thick
and
lightly
carbonated
with
a
sweet
dry
bourbony
finish
a
strong
base
of
caramel
toffee
and
crisp
malts
supports
the
strong
oak
and
woody
flavors
of
the
spirits
and
dark
fruits
incredibly
smooth
and
balanced
with
surprisingly
little
alcohol
heat
throughout
despite
the
strong
booze
and
spirit
presence
this
is
an
exceptional
barrel
aged
beer
as
an
aside
i
saw
that
this
was
aged
in
jack
daniels
barrels
and
the
label
plainly
styles
this
as
a
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
ive
always
been
fascinated
by
the
debate
about
jack
daniels
being
tennessee
whiskey
not
bourbon
i
digress
4
0
d
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
isnt
nearly
as
good
as
the
average
score
suggests
this
doesnt
hold
a
handle
to
08
ba
old
ruffian
or
any
vintage
of
cwbbbw
ill
put
it
on
a
similar
level
to
weyerbacher
insanity
in
terms
of
quality
with
this
being
a
hell
of
a
lot
bigger
i
gave
this
a
4
0
to
elevate
the
overall
score
a
bit
since
i
think
the
taste
is
right
on
the
3
54
0
border
d
again
im
still
not
a
huge
fan
of
barleywines
but
this
along
with
a
couple
of
others
are
helping
me
to
turn
the
corner
infinitely
rich
and
complex
with
a
very
enticing
nose
and
feel
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
2009
vintage
on
tap
at
alpine
caramel
coloered
with
a
small
head
that
recedes
to
a
thin
crown
aroma
is
amazing
rich
caramelized
malts
wrapped
in
bourbon
oak
and
vanilla
wonderfully
oxidized
sherry
like
with
a
hint
of
savoriness
the
palate
is
massively
malty
and
rich
flavors
of
butterscotch
and
bourbon
are
balanced
by
tannic
oak
oxidation
lends
notes
of
sherry
and
faint
soy
sauce
full
almost
syrupy
body
yet
this
is
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
and
very
balanced
this
was
very
good
from
the
bottle
but
its
outstanding
on
tap
theres
virtually
no
trace
of
alcohol
and
the
balance
between
beer
and
barrel
is
impeccable
overall
an
excellent
bourbon
barleywine
after
a
bunch
of
overpowered
bourbon
bombs
this
one
nailed
it
and
showed
what
a
babeer
can
be
in
the
right
hands
another
homerun
from
alpine
highly
recommend
if
you
can
find
it
not
avail
here
in
tx
so
got
from
milt
rotation
lucky
to
get
this
one
so
this
will
probably
be
it
would
have
again
but
only
if
sharing
with
some
friends
no
dnice
sipper
ive
had
this
beer
on
three
different
occasions
the
first
was
at
stone
oakquinox
from
a
jockey
box
and
i
thought
it
was
the
best
thing
there
i
was
bowled
over
by
it
the
second
was
both
2005
and
2009
versions
at
the
brewpub
and
i
was
let
down
i
recall
there
being
a
weird
smell
akin
to
cat
food
in
the
2005
and
the
2009
needed
some
time
to
round
into
form
id
rate
this
most
recent
experience
to
be
in
between
those
prior
ones
this
is
a
good
beer
but
there
are
a
number
of
other
barrelaged
barleywines
that
are
better
imo
if
you
can
get
two
bottles
of
great
do
it
and
sit
on
one
of
them
for
about
10
years
and
see
what
happens
to
it
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
it
is
a
heavy
and
somewhat
palate
crushing
brew
a
real
treat
that
i
was
stoked
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
d
i
am
glad
i
have
another
bottle
to
try
in
a
year
or
so
hopefully
the
booze
mellows
a
bit
edit
2011
though
for
some
reason
this
beer
keeps
popping
in
my
head
perhaps
i
was
too
new
to
the
style
and
reviewed
it
low
die
to
my
inexperience
must
try
on
my
next
visit
to
the
brewery
if
i
can
find
it
best
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywine
ive
ever
had
impression
name
of
the
beer
says
it
all
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
maroon
highlights
and
a
thin
head
that
left
good
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
was
very
nice
with
big
caramel
and
whiskey
aromas
from
the
oak
there
were
hints
of
vanilla
brown
sugar
and
booze
that
was
not
dominating
the
nose
which
was
well
hidden
up
front
the
taste
was
big
on
caramel
and
whiskey
flavors
with
vanilla
toffee
and
slight
booze
accetns
the
beer
was
full
bodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
that
had
a
thick
sweet
syrupy
and
faint
boozy
finish
apline
came
through
with
an
exceptional
barleywine
style
brew
that
was
really
drinkable
and
made
me
want
to
serve
up
more
in
my
glass
every
time
it
was
empty
an
aptly
named
beer
im
very
glad
i
got
to
try
another
winner
from
the
alpine
folks
wow
topnotch
fantastic
beer
that
deserves
its
rating
possibly
the
most
complex
deep
robust
ba
barleywines
ive
ever
had
wonderful
to
boot
my
opinion
of
alpine
only
continues
to
rise
d
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
especially
for
the
14
abv
ill
have
to
crack
open
a
bottle
soon
to
see
how
its
doing
in
there
a
very
barrel
forward
approach
given
the
style
which
settles
out
to
offer
a
port
like
quality
and
improving
in
complexity
with
warming
d
the
booze
is
remarkably
well
hidden
and
it
goes
down
way
too
easy
overall
a
great
beer
cant
wait
to
get
some
bottles
of
this
when
it
comes
out
again
12oz
bottle
which
i
was
lucky
enough
to
receive
from
my
cousin
love
that
guy
i
split
this
with
two
other
friends
because
lets
face
it
its
is
strong
as
hell
my
buddy
said
teh
first
whiff
was
like
dogfood
or
rather
a
dog
treat
and
it
did
remind
me
of
snausages
or
soemthing
luckily
as
it
opened
up
it
smelled
like
tootsie
rolls
very
nice
and
sweet
the
flavor
was
pretty
delicious
like
more
chocolate
and
tootsie
rolls
not
much
wood
or
spirits
but
it
definitely
had
a
kick
of
heat
on
the
back
end
very
nice
barleywine
but
four
ounces
was
plenty
for
me
keep
up
the
great
work
alpine

poured
from
the
bottle
with
great
anticipation
a
deep
garnet
hue
with
ruby
highlights
and
absolutely
no
head
an
absolutely
huge
and
wonderful
nose
on
this
one
with
the
expected
bourbon
along
with
vanilla
brown
sugar
and
molasses
flavors
of
bourbon
toffee
caramel
vanilla
alcohol
very
syrupy
and
hot
with
a
somewhat
cloying
mouthfeel
and
a
huge
bourbon
presence
a
very
good
beer
one
that
could
take
some
time
in
the
bottle
given
the
abv
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
top
notch
barleywine
which
i
would
like
to
drink
more
of
in
the
future
overall
a
very
solid
bwine
it
is
big
smooth
and
drinkable
lots
of
flavor
and
the
bourbon
barrels
really
tied
the
beer
together
to
make
it
complex
yet
drinkable
i
am
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
one
very
solid
this
would
really
be
a
quite
expensive
and
debatably
a
waste
of
this
beer
marinade
but
i
think
reducing
this
down
a
bit
and
using
this
as
a
marinade
andor
barbecue
glaze
would
on
beef
steak
tips
especially
maybe
chicken
too
would
be
absolutely
amazing
overall
this
is
a
world
class
beer
in
my
opinion
highly
recommended
pours
murky
brown
with
no
head
the
aroma
is
caramel
brown
sugar
some
alcohol
oak
and
bourbon
it
is
very
sweet
the
flavor
is
vanilla
maple
alcohol
and
brown
sugar
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
notches
darker
than
the
norm
pour
a
deep
mahogany
amber
color
with
a
shallow
off
white
head
that
fades
quickly
without
leaving
much
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
unique
aggressive
and
amazing
im
overwhelmed
by
the
complexity
initially
comes
across
with
that
classic
corny
butterscotch
then
an
intense
maple
syrup
over
aunt
jemima
eggo
waffles
or
the
revelation
that
an
easy
way
to
kick
up
a
pancake
batter
is
to
add
a
dash
of
vanilla
extract
follows
light
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
full
bodied
with
a
creamy
smooth
texture
and
chewy
character
full
flavored
the
rich
sweet
characteristics
of
the
nose
are
mirrored
in
taste
and
enhanced
nicely
by
the
body
maple
pancakes
with
vanilla
accents
and
black
licorice
caramel
and
dark
fruit
experience
it
all
lingers
quite
nicely
the
14
abv
is
extremely
well
integrated
a
booziness
is
present
and
expected
to
some
extent
in
this
style
highly
recommended
d
very
delicious
not
extremely
complex
but
just
done
so
incredibly
well
d
very
good
the
alcohol
is
obvious
but
for
its
abv
it
drinks
very
well
3

d
this
is
a
great
sipping
beer
i
am
glad
i
had
to
pleasure
to
try
this
it
has
great
complexity
and
is
such
a
great
beer
grab
this
while
you
can
d
this
beer
has
indeed
earned
its
name
quite
a
great
beer
that
id
love
to
have
again
yes
i
know
it
was
an
awful
joke
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
for
a
bal
aged
beer
of
this
strength
this
was
definitely
best
of
show
for
me
just
incredible
possibly
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
i
cant
believe
this
beer
isnt
in
the
top
100
pours
a
clear
caramel
brown
not
much
of
a
head
just
some
lacing
around
the
sides
the
smell
explodes
with
molasses
brown
sugar
and
whiskey
the
taste
is
rich
and
sweet
powdery
sugar
and
a
sugary
burnt
marshmallow
finish
on
the
back
of
the
palate
although
its
a
comopletely
different
beer
the
explosion
of
sweetness
and
the
specific
sugary
aspect
to
this
was
so
similar
in
my
mind
to
black
tuesday
it
was
really
amazing
for
a
sipping
beer
alpine
did
a
great
job
here
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
heavy
bodied
with
a
very
light
carbonation
excellent
this
was
some
pretty
impressive
stuff
wonderful
melding
of
flavors
here
between
the
beer
barrel
and
the
feel
and
drinkibility
on
this
were
pretty
awesome
for
the
size
id
love
to
tuck
a
few
more
of
these
away
for
cellaring
as
this
is
one
thats
only
going
to
get
even
better
with
time
d
massive
abv
and
a
bit
of
a
mouthfeel
issue
pretty
damn
tasty
though
if
youre
looking
for
a
kick
you
in
the
teeth
beer
then
this
fits
the
bill
very
nicely
if
youre
looking
for
something
complex
and
subtle
well
this
could
still
be
for
you
because
there
is
plenty
to
find
but
the
mouthfeel
issues
really
hurt
what
they
were
trying
to
do
and
turn
this
from
what
could
have
been
an
absolutely
stunning
beer
to
a
still
respectable
tasty
treat
dangerously
drinkable
nice
juicythick
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
even
richer
than
the
aroma
if
that
can
be
believed
big
boozey
bourbon
notes
are
in
communion
with
caramel
brown
sugar
cookies
butterscotch
toffee
molasses
vanilla
dates
figs
plums
and
prunes
the
combination
of
toffee
and
nuttiness
is
not
unlike
peanut
brittle
sherrylike
oxidation
is
graceful
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
in
the
bottle
i
didnt
find
that
to
be
the
case
with
the
draught
version
bow
before
this
beast
i
think
6oz
would
be
a
perfect
serving
size
and
i
have
double
the
number
before
me
i
definitely
should
have
split
this
with
another
this
is
very
well
done
seek
it
out
drinkability
really
freaking
good
barleywine
but
saying
that
the
14
is
rather
noticeable
after
a
while
i
like
how
the
beer
is
super
intense
and
chocked
full
of
caramel
but
not
sweet
a
little
bit
of
time
will
definitely
help
things
and
now
i
wish
i
would
have
traded
for
two
thanks
much
jess
overall
this
is
better
then
i
could
have
hoped
for
a
superb
version
of
a
barrel
aged
barleywine
the
vanilla
and
toffee
notes
from
the
barrel
are
perfect
mellow
and
subdued
are
the
orginal
hops
from
the
beer
instead
a
sultry
sweet
and
superb
flavor
have
come
forward
if
every
barrel
aged
beer
i
have
is
like
this
i
would
be
a
happy
man
the
aroma
emanates
maple
bourbon
booze
caramelized
sugars
and
a
tad
of
peaty
dryness
pretty
far
out
tastes
of
toffee
but
not
as
sweet
peaty
slightly
earthy
finish
has
a
full
bitterness
to
it
with
a
lingering
bourbon
and
maple
character
yes
this
one
is
big
and
boozy
but
it
is
oh
so
good
full
in
body
but
maybe
lighter
than
expected
despite
the
lack
of
visible
carbonation
there
are
plenty
of
tiny
prickly
bubbles
to
enhance
the
flavor
very
high
quality
example
of
the
style
high
drinkability
for
what
it
is
not
quite
perfect
but
high
good
good
stuff
d
this
is
really
really
good
the
barrelaging
is
very
subtle
and
it
hits
the
zone
for
me
when
its
at
the
upper
range
of
the
recommended
drinking
temperature
lovely
i
want
more
its
pricey
as
hell
at
11
a
12oz
but
this
may
be
one
of
the
few
beers
where
i
think
its
actually
worth
it
like
a
hair
of
the
dog
special
release
edit
i
have
been
informed
that
this
was
8
12oz
at
the
release
that
is
well
worth
it
imo
ahhhh
why
i
love
english
barley
wines
so
much
on
top
of
that
add
bourbon
barrel
aging
and
you
have
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
tried
in
a
long
long
while
a
dessert
style
beer
very
sweet
with
mission
fig
rum
soaked
rasins
caramel
date
currant
bourbon
vanilla
alcohol
burn
a
perfect
tingly
mouthfeel
from
a
hint
of
carbonation
that
adds
to
the
complexity
slight
oxidation
and
sherry
quality
christ
this
is
good
pours
hazy
garnetbrown
in
color
with
ample
tan
carbonation
smells
of
bourbon
raisins
brown
sugar
vanilla
and
lots
of
toffee
among
others
i
like
it
but
the
buttery
toffee
component
is
a
little
too
much
for
my
taste
reminds
me
a
bit
of
olde
bluehairs
smell
taste
is
outstanding
those
same
toffee
bourbon
raisin
and
brown
sugar
qualities
are
all
quite
strong
and
blend
together
well
not
hoppy
at
all
this
sits
on
the
line
where
barleywines
end
and
old
ales
begin
mouthfeel
is
thick
sticky
coating
and
wellsupported
by
ample
carbonation
at
14
i
was
expecting
to
have
difficulty
drinking
this
but
those
concerns
proved
unfounded
d
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
one
again
in
a
year
i
split
the
bottle
with
someone
else
and
that
was
fine
by
me
d
oh
no
one
is
more
than
enough
overall
if
cellared
correctly
this
beer
could
age
beautifully
a
try
it
beer
cheers
perhaps
a
cigar
and
a
taster
of
this
beer
is
in
order
i
enjoyed
this
ba
barleywine
the
14
definitly
limits
how
much
i
of
this
i
would
drink
but
this
is
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
barleywine
i
have
had
will
try
another
bottle
of
great
in
a
year
or
two
d
this
was
a
decadent
desert
beer
i
split
the
12
oz
and
loved
it
but
dont
think
i
could
drink
much
more
than
that
decent
consistency
at
mouthfeel
a
bit
watery
for
my
taste
but
still
nice
very
well
balanced
flavors
and
body
with
a
great
alcohol
warming
effect
without
being
overtaken
by
this
14
beast
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
and
would
love
to
put
this
side
by
side
with
other
barrelaged
barleywines
something
tells
me
time
will
improve
this
great
beer
too
this
feels
like
it
could
benefit
from
a
few
years
and
i
am
very
excited
to
see
how
it
matures

vintage
poured
into
my
rader
snifter
tonight
dark
brownish
red
34
inch
creamy
light
tan
head
retention
was
around
ten
minutes
which
was
suprising
for
a
two
year
old
barrel
aged
beer
some
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
too
aroma
consists
of
bourbon
first
sweet
malts
including
toffee
and
caramel
brown
sugar
alcohol
prunes
biscuit
mild
citrus
and
oak
flavor
starts
off
with
a
semi
sweet
vanilla
flavor
sweetness
along
with
some
almost
toasted
malts
in
the
middle
that
were
much
like
the
biscuit
i
could
smell
some
mild
alcohol
flavors
in
the
finish
but
nothing
like
you
would
expect
from
a
beer
of
this
strength
also
some
oak
and
vanilla
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
more
whiskey
comes
out
as
it
warms
it
tastes
very
jack
daniels
like
too
warms
up
with
more
malts
coming
to
the
surface
but
never
really
gets
cloying
or
hot
sweet
warming
and
malty
mouthfeel
medium
to
full
bodied
low
to
medium
carbonation
taste
lingers
a
long
time
this
beer
is
very
smooth
but
almost
syrupy
alcohol
is
hidden
well
for
fourteen
percent
it
is
a
bit
filling
though
drank
most
of
this
bottle
tonight
and
did
not
want
anything
else
i
have
wanted
to
try
this
beer
for
years
and
glad
i
finally
got
the
chance
it
certainly
lived
up
to
expectations
and
i
am
interested
in
seeing
what
the
higher
alcohol
version
batch
two
tastes
like
in
the
future
recommended
thanks
dave
you
my
friend
are
in
fact
great
same
goes
for
the
beer
yum
and
thanks
to
joey
for
the
hook
up
sd
style
this
is
one
for
sipping
all
evening
long
though
the
alcohol
is
fairly
wellhidden
given
the
abv
a
big
complex
and
damn
tasty
beer
thanks
again
to
derek
for
this
rarity

pours
a
clear
copper
to
brown
color
with
lasting
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
is
up
in
your
face
big
and
bold
with
the
aroma
of
a
oak
paneled
shed
followed
by
sweet
creamy
caramel
candy
and
some
chocolate
malts
it
also
has
a
sizable
load
of
fruity
esters
with
prunes
dates
and
a
bucket
of
raisins
the
alcohol
is
not
all
that
well
hidden
for
a
10
beer
but
for
this
beers
big
abv
it
isnt
too
bad
the
flavor
is
just
as
bold
as
the
aroma
with
a
whack
in
the
face
by
a
freshly
milled
oak
plank
followed
quickly
by
red
wine
grapes
red
wine
tannins
mixed
with
rich
caramel
candy
the
alcohol
is
there
too
nice
another
decade
of
age
could
see
this
good
beer
turn
truly
great
pours
a
cola
brown
to
amber
in
color
clear
with
a
small
cream
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
a
ring
aromas
are
strong
of
the
barrel
ageing
salty
a
deep
leatheriness
woodiness
and
a
good
booziness
are
most
prominent
there
are
sweet
pruny
malts
in
the
background
more
subdued
under
the
effects
of
the
barrel
agitation
reveals
more
of
the
deep
leather
oak
and
bourbon
notes
you
can
almost
smell
the
inside
of
a
barrel
taste
is
a
flash
of
rich
maltiness
up
front
followed
by
the
booziness
leather
and
grapesraisins
and
finishing
oaky
and
dry
a
boozy
bite
warms
the
back
of
the
throat
mouthfeel
is
medium
low
carbonation
keeps
it
somewhat
slick
dry
on
the
tongue
in
the
aftertaste
and
warming
this
is
one
of
those
beers
for
me
where
from
the
first
smell
i
am
taken
in
my
pen
is
writing
furiously
rather
than
searching
for
aromas
and
flavors
id
love
to
try
the
good
i
am
sure
it
is
an
outstanding
barleywine
based
on
this
sample
i
hope
that
alpine
produces
this
again
in
the
future
outstanding
beer
from
the
bottle
at
spuyten
duyvil
in
brooklyn
new
york
light
bronze
color
unfortunately
it
has
a
very
mild
nose
overall
but
it
does
show
some
barrel
contribution
coconut
toasted
oak
vanilla
very
mild
piney
aroma
hops
and
a
caramel
laden
malty
aspect
extremely
well
hidden
alcohol
shockingly
hidden
beyond
belief
quite
honestly
yet
it
isnt
quite
as
rich
as
i
had
hoped
nice
blending
of
butter
toffeeish
malt
with
the
barrel
contribution
quite
profound
with
toasted
oak
and
vanilla
flavors
creamy
big
full
body
yet
lacking
in
texture
in
a
way
still
pretty
delicious
overall
although
i
did
expect
a
bit
more
i
should
have
bought
a
case
this
beer
will
be
amazing
in
a
few
more
years
a
work
of
art
and
pat
mcilhenney
deserves
all
the
thanks
given
the
time
involved
in
making
this
7
50
is
a
bargin
more
if
you
want
to
try
a
big
sipper
with
some
complexity
look
no
further
this
is
very
big
and
very
well
done
my
kind
of
beer
great
is
a
perfect
name
for
this
beer
oak
barrel
aged
notes
of
vanilla
and
bourbon
come
through
in
this
barleywine
it
is
deep
dark
with
some
red
hues
clear
no
head
it
is
still
available
at
the
brewery
so
i
dont
know
why
it
is
retired
but
it
soon
will
be
since
they
said
they
didnt
have
much
left
very
yummy
beer
dark
brown
sparkly
carbonation
aroma
is
fruity
alchohol
bourbon
sweet
malty
huge
bourbon
flavors
took
me
by
surprise
i
was
not
expecting
so
much
whiskey
flavor
followed
by
cereal
malt
flavor
and
a
strange
vegetable
kind
of
aftertaste
i
couldnt
place
it
this
beer
is
like
drinking
bourbon
but
without
the
alhoholic
sting
a
heavy
powerful
brew
syrupy
and
sweet
very
glad
i
shared
the
bottle
with
someone
take
your
time
and
enjoy
this
one
d
probably
should
have
split
this
bad
dog
with
someone
becomes
a
bit
cloying
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
this
beer
poured
a
clear
redamber
color
with
thin
tan
colored
foam
the
smell
was
light
bourbon
with
vanilla
caramel
and
molasses
and
some
malt
the
taste
was
malty
with
flavors
of
caramel
molasses
bourbon
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
very
nice
rich
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
smooth
with
mediumfull
body
and
low
carbonation
the
finish
and
aftertaste
were
filled
with
flavors
of
wood
malt
and
alcohol
this
was
an
excellent
and
quite
enjoyable
brew
taste
is
also
very
boubon
like
but
with
nice
and
smooth
bitterness
but
high
dosed
overall
well
balanced
but
all
tastecomponents
double
and
extra
great
beer
to
sip
but
be
aware
of
the
14
as
it
still
is
quiet
drinkable
i
give
a
great
bighuge
thanks
to
the
great
darren
of
longbeach
for
the
great
beer
this
beer
would
make
a
poor
session
beer
it
is
way
too
high
in
alcohol
to
drink
all
night
also
it
is
very
aggressive
it
would
wear
thin
very
quickly
as
far
as
a
single
glass
this
beer
lives
up
to
its
name
it
was
great
this
will
put
hair
on
your
back
whooooaaa
this
is
like
drinking
a
watered
down
bourbon
whiskey
add
some
oak
barrel
taste
and
youve
got
the
great
mouthfeel
was
full
and
loaded
with
stinging
alcohol
i
love
a
good
strong
brew
but
this
was
a
whiskey
bomb
at
best
cheers
a
seriously
big
mahalo
to
aleoha
for
this
guilty
treat
a
2011
drink
it
fresher
than
i
did
this
review
is
for
2012
version
which
is
a
completely
different
beer
than
1314
2014
edition
from
a
bomber
pours
a
deep
chocolate
brown
that
light
barely
penetrates
to
think
this
was
a
clear
red
brew
just
a
couple
of
years
ago
low
carbonation
and
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
with
the
cocoa
nibs
first
introduced
last
year
prominent
almost
no
hop
flavor
all
roasted
dark
malts
unstated
abv
and
absolutely
no
alcohol
taste
or
aroma
but
it
comes
up
on
one
towards
the
end
of
the
bottle
first
sip
was
a
little
sweet
for
someone
like
me
who
doesnt
appreciate
that
but
my
palate
settled
into
to
it
quickly
obviously
not
an
all
day
drinker
but
well
positioned
as
a
dessert
beer
i
suspect
this
may
develop
in
interesting
ways
over
the
next
few
weeks
as
the
yeast
settles
out
more
and
possibly
fall
off
fairly
quickly
afterwards
snazzy
new
label
md
as
mentioned
sharp
and
a
bit
harsh
it
needs
a
year
on
it
makes
me
glad
i
got
two
bottles
for
christmas
i
will
hang
on
to
the
second
one
for
a
year
or
so
and
edit
this
review
accordingly
i
really
like
quite
a
bit
of
bbcs
offerings
but
this
years
holidale
is
unimpressive
to
say
the
least
seems
like
they
were
going
for
something
very
different
in
a
coffeechocolate
barleywine
but
it
just
doesnt
work
here
however
i
would
respectfully
recommend
that
beer
advocate
set
up
a
new
annual
listing
for
this
beer
berkshire
acknowledges
that
the
recipe
changes
every
year
so
someone
who
reviewed
this
in
2010
or
2011
is
getting
an
entirely
different
character
in
2013
appearance
is
reddish
clear
with
thin
white
head
nose
is
heavy
with
cherries
syrup
grenadine
and
caramel
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
one
notes
malt
sweetness
not
enough
hops
to
cut
out
the
fruit
taste
is
sweet
and
oxidized
out
heel
is
heavy
with
low
carbonation
overall
not
that
great
not
really
to
style
barley
wines
make
a
statement
theyre
either
boozy
or
have
an
incredible
amount
of
flavor
to
cover
their
high
abv
this
beer
gives
you
the
hint
of
booziness
or
strong
flavor
but
its
just
not
that
strong
alright
but
then
wheres
my
holichip
rim
shot
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunset
bronzeauburn
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
pine
resin
light
dark
greens
rich
toffee
and
a
touch
of
fruitcake
way
in
the
background
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
toffee
and
pine
duking
it
out
for
my
entertainment
creating
a
decently
nice
balance
and
some
mild
stone
fruits
dance
in
the
back
seemingly
egging
on
the
combatants
normally
when
i
use
those
terms
it
means
theres
a
flavor
clash
on
my
tongue
but
this
time
its
just
to
illustrate
the
balanced
seesaw
thing
going
on
instead
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
pretty
nice
brew
one
that
brings
the
hop
pain
without
overwhelming
with
it
gotta
love
balance
eh
o
overall
this
was
a
fun
vertical
they
really
are
different
beers
with
each
year
12
is
a
very
nice
hoppy
barleywine
but
05
is
simply
unreal
the
tart
apples
and
brandy
qualities
make
this
incredible
wish
i
had
another
bottle
of
05
o
surpassed
my
expectations
a
very
impressive
beer
by
itself
or
based
on
style
hop
heads
will
love
this
wellcrafted
brew
o
if
it
werent
for
the
fact
that
ive
never
had
a
bbc
beer
feature
this
hop
profile
id
swear
this
was
mislabeled
what
the
hell
happened
this
is
not
a
barleywine
this
isnt
even
an
american
barleywine
its
a
lightly
hopped
slightly
dank
average
run
of
the
mill
ipa
not
even
going
to
include
this
in
my
overall
score
of
the
beer
because
im
just
so
puzzled
for
the
love
of
god
return
to
your
roots
in
2013
2
755
d
its
a
somewhat
square
american
barleywine
which
is
more
than
i
was
expecting
as
i
initially
thought
this
was
a
spiced
christmas
beer
of
some
sort
nothing
wrong
here
but
not
much
to
distinguish
itself
from
a
crowded
field
o
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
almost
a
dipa
in
hop
flavor
great
at
the
pricepoint
highly
reccomended
bit
league
flavors
will
purchase
again
drink
i
opened
this
on
christmas
at
3am
it
was
a
nice
beer
to
unwind
with
after
a
long
christmas
eve
day
and
putting
presents
out
for
the
kids
a
welcome
gift
from
my
rs
member
nice
flavors
and
semi
balanced
maybe
letting
this
sit
for
a
year
isnt
a
bad
idea
either
maybe
i
can
get
another
bottle
this
was
deceptively
strong
but
the
alcohol
never
detracted
from
the
beer
and
the
apricot
and
cherry
shone
through
nicely
without
having
the
sweetness
of
a
belgian
beer
although
it
was
a
bit
too
dry
it
fit
the
bill
nicely
on
this
late
fall
day
and
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
accessible
examples
of
this
style
that
ive
ever
had
o
a
great
barley
wine
overall
nice
flavor
and
very
palatable
definitely
could
be
more
powerful
but
still
impressive
interested
in
trying
some
fresh
popping
the
cap
my
nose
is
hit
was
a
nice
dose
of
citrusy
hops
surprising
poured
into
a
goblet
a
couplefinger
head
leaves
a
smattering
of
rorschach
blots
around
the
glass
the
second
pour
really
cakes
it
on
tight
elegant
lace
rings
the
nose
is
exotic
fruit
jam
sweet
by
not
cloying
i
think
this
version
is
more
like
an
imperial
englishstyle
ipa
than
a
barleywine
so
get
this
while
its
fresh
the
finish
is
dryly
hoppy
without
any
significant
bitterness
really
invites
the
next
sip
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
if
this
is
still
in
the
9
5
10
range
it
doesnt
taste
like
it
sweetness
is
quickly
cut
through
with
a
grainy
rustic
bread
quality
that
balances
the
brew
nicely
the
blurb
on
the
bottle
describes
its
bitterness
as
prominent
without
being
aggressive
which
is
about
right
bbc
has
really
been
ringing
my
bell
lately
this
is
definitely
up
there
with
my
favorites
good
stuff

i
really
enjoy
the
coffeehouse
porter
from
berkshire
but
most
of
their
other
beers
strike
me
as
too
heavy
on
the
diacytyl
decent
beer
but
not
great
mouthfeel
is
great
very
drinkable
for
this
style
medium
to
full
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
of
the
soft
variety
sweet
finish
good
barleywine
not
as
bold
as
others
but
in
a
certain
sense
its
nice
to
have
one
thats
quaffable
relatively
of
course
interesting
beer
but
id
probably
never
do
it
again

the
mouthful
of

with
substantial

and
glimpses
of
the
ample

mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
right
where
they
should
if
not
better
and
im
always
glad
to
see
this
one
each
year
no
wow
factor
per
se
but
really
nice
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
definitely
recommended
another
hit
from
berkshire
i
can
only
imagine
if
this
were
given
the
barrel
treatment
o
a
complex
full
and
robust
barleywine
with
rich
malty
flavors
and
a
big
time
hop
wallop
at

abv
this
2010
version
i
cracked
open
at
christmas
couldve
sat
another
year
but
man
was
it
worth
the
wait
up
til
now
would
definitely
recommend
getting
a
couple
bottles
to
age
and
compare
o
pretty
good
not
a
goto
barleywine
for
me
but
still
a
nice
offering
o
an
enjoyable
barleywine
though
i
would
like
more
hops
m
poured
a
2
beige
head
hazy
copper
color
with
slow
moving
carbonation
smells
mildly
of
malt
taste
is
so
much
more
than
the
smell
with
malt
rich
toffe
vanilla
and
milk
chocolate
the
body
is
only
medium
thick
for
barleywine
but
still
nice
this
every
bit
the
holiday
celebration
it
was
intended
to
be
pours
a
moderate
amber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
and
a
tad
bit
of
spotty
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
some
spice
along
with
caramel
and
dark
fruits
a
bit
of
sweet
bread
in
the
background
the
flavor
has
caramel
and
sweet
malt
plus
some
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
of
winter
spice
medium
body
with
spice
and
a
bit
of
booze
to
go
along
with
the
sweetness
an
interesting
winter
beer
though
probably
not
something
that
i
would
seek
out
again
o
this
beer
struck
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
i
thought
the
aging
on
it
did
kill
off
any
hops
that
were
in
here
but
i
thought
it
gave
way
to
a
nice
cherry
forward
barleywine
alcohol
is
high
making
this
a
beer
to
split
with
someone
else
but
it
was
wonderful
for
what
it
was
tastes
more
of
an
american

very
good
drinkability
for
what
should
be
a
sipper
alcohol
well
hidden
thanks
dr
jay
do
drinkability
is
moderate
i
feel
this
beer
doesnt
really
have
much
of
an
identity
as
it
seems
at
times
that
the
hops
come
across
stronger
than
the
malts
which
is
just
strange
for
the
style
at
first
its
hot
and
awkward
but
luckily
it
smooths
out
as
it
aerates
maybe
in
a
few
years
the
hops
will
fade
even
more
to
make
this
more
integrated
this
is
a
fantastic
seasonal
barleywine
that
i
cant
get
enough
of
very
unique
and
satisfying
probably
my
favorite
barleywine
im
gonna
try
to
save
one
this
time
to
see
how
it
ages
hopefully
i
can
control
myself
dbcb
set
out
to
make
a
nice
malty
barleywine
which
they
definitely
succeed
in
in
future
years
i
would
want
a
bit
more
balance
but
a
very
nice
beer
regardless
drinkability
i
am
thoroughly
enjoying
sipping
on
this
beer
definitely
a
complex
barleywine
with
some
unique
bbc
character
i
am
finding
it
to
be
very
drinkable
at
8
5
and
a
wonderful
way
to
warm
up

a
cold

hazy

the

the

is
smooth

straightup

a
barleywine
should
be
able
to
last
a

i
see
others
have
had
the
09
with
more
positive
results
ive
held
it
in
the
cellar
the
whole
time
perhaps
a
bad
bottle
but
what
bad
nothing
like
the
other
good
experiences
ive
had
with
berkshire
md
medium
bodied
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
overall
very
happy
with
this
beer
went
down
very
easy
and
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
that
i
decided
to
share
this
bottle
a
great
beer
for
the
winter
with
the
slight
presence
of
the
alcohol
but
not
in
a
bad
way
whatsoever
d
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
it
demands
slow
sipping
owing
to
the
richness
of
sweet
flavors
it
would
benefit
from
being
drier
or
failing
that
having
more
balancing
hop
bitterness
d
goes
down
very
easily
very
tasty
somewhat
filling
nice
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
fantastic
winter
drinking
beer
alcohol
is
masked
nicely
and
worthy
of
having
a
few
of
the
barleywine
style
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
it
has
a
peculiar
texture
and
its
flavor
is
not
unlike
wine
and
i
like
the
fact
that
it
is
by
nature
of
its
high
abv
more
of
a
sipping
beer
bbcs
offering
is
a
wonderful
example
of
a
traditional
barleywine
with
a
smooth
finish
and
rich
dark
flavor
this
one
would
be
an
excellent
introduction
to
barleywines
and
will
reward
many
times
over
this
one
surprised
me
the
first
few
sips
i
found
pretty
bland
but
i
liked
it
much
more
as
it
went
on
this
is
a
very
unique
barleywine
and
i
like
that
ive
never
had
it
fresh
but
at
2
years
old
this
was
great
drinkability
an
above
average
barleywine
with
a
small
holiday
kick
this
is
a
nice
malty
beer
that
is
a
sipper
i
would
order
this
again
but
will
not
be
in
rush
to
get
it
drinkability
well
done
from
the
folks
at
bbc
the
good
thing
with
this
beer
is
they
made
an
actual
barley
wine
and
didnt
attempt
to
dillute
it
down
with
spices
making
it
a
winter
warmer
a
nice
kick
of
hops
in
here
really
shines
throughout
and
the
alcohol
warmth
makes
this
suitable
for
any
cold
winter
night
ill
be
looking
for
this
again
sweet
but
smooth
decidedly
malty
and
englishstyle
for
a
barleywine
theres
no
hop
bite
this
is
all
brown
sugar
and
fruitcake
raisin
and
date
despite
the
sweetness
the
body
isnt
terribly
heavy
more
a
mediumfull
the
finish
is
sweet
and
fruity
reminiscent
of
fruit
jelly
its
an
enjoyable
beer
though
i
feel
it
could
use
more
of
a
balancing
dryness
a
bit
more
body
and
dryness
in
the
finish
would
improve
this
greatly
d
i
might
make
this
my
goto
barleywine
if
i
can
find
in
the
stores
drinks
pretty
well
alcohol
heat
is
integrated
well
and
only
there
if
you
look
for
it
sweet
and
spicy
flavors
mingle
well
to
create
a
tasty
yet
rather
refreshing
beer
thats
quite
different
for
a
barleywine
which
is
nice
md
chewy
and
velvety
mouth
similar
to
a
milk
stout
highly
drinkable
and
would
not
have
guessed
this
to
be
8
5
probably
the
most
approachable
barleywine
ive
had
d
all
i
said
in
my
notes
were
super
awesome
excellent
beer
ill
leave
it
at
that
d
this
tastes
like
an
unfinished
symphony
it
was
rising
to
a
flavor
crescendo
and
then
blueballed
by
a
bwine
overall
a
very
good
version
of
the
style
maybe
my
favorite
j
the
palate
is
quite
a
disappointment
opening
quite
sweet
with
a
rather
prominent
hop
character
i
get
a
ton
of
really
good
flavors
up
front
with
caramel
toffee
and
mint
all
making
for
a
tasty
beverage
before
a
finish
that
is
sorely
lacking
in
character
the
blend
up
front
featuring
the
caramel
and
pine
is
pleasant
but
the
beer
quickly
devolves
to
a
mildly
bitter
finish
with
no
real
malt
flavors
that
one
expects
from
a
barleywine
and
while
there
is
a
certain
heft
to
the
palate
this
still
comes
across
as
slightly
watery
even
when
at
60f
is
there
rye
in
this
beer
the
spiciness
i
taste
is
definitely
not
from
the
alcohol
i
can
swear
theres
some
in
hereand
some
reviews
refer
to
it
as
well
also
with
time
im
noticing
a
butterscotch
character
which
isnt
wholly
pleasant
either
especially
in
conjunction
with
the
hop
profile
medium
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
the
palate
is
decent
but
for
the
finish
solid
stuff
for
a
fan
of
barleywines
but
since
im
not
in
that
camp
im
harder
to
please
i
like
my
barleywine
relatively
hot
and
this
is
just
about
ready
its
a
2009
btw
f
drier
especially
with
help
from
the
lingering
rye
some
spicy
fruit
lingering
bitterness
and
some
lingering
syrup
and
brown
sugar
d
a
big
brew
alas
it
doesnt
seem
to
fit
the
style
the
way
i
remembered
it
being
in
bottled
form
leans
toward
the
malts
wout
becoming
cloying
so
it
is
drinkable
for
what
it
is
the
holidale
could
use
a
dose
more
hops
imo
d
although
9
5
in
alcohol
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinker
alcohol
isnt
noticeable
in
the
flavor
or
aroma
really
nice
barley
wine
well
balanced
not
too
hoppy
or
too
sweet
i
passed
on
this
last
year
and
regreted
it
only
bought
one
bottle
this
year
maybe
next
year
ill
learn
my
lesson
a
pick
up
a
few
of
these
to
enjoy
throughout
the
year
thanks

low

flavor
on
this

flavors
a
touch

spicy

and
very
wellbalanced
hopping
theres
almost
a
citrusy
orangelemonlime
type
thing
going
and
is
reminiscent
of
sweet
tart
candies
this
is
an
american
barleywine
that
i
can
get
into
because
its
not
ridiculously
overthetop
hopped
which
i
think
really
can
get
in
the
way
of
what
a
barleywine
is
supposed
to
be
with
other
brews
in
the
same
category
great
slick
mouthfeel
coats
the
tongue
and
the
high
abv
can
barely
be
felt
im
really
digging
the
balance
on
this
beer
and
i
have
to
say
its
probably
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
in
a
very
long
time
excellent
stuff
and
im
sure
its
recieved
lower
ratings
because
some
people
think
that
if
doesnt
offend
your
palate
with
hops
then
it
must
not
be
good
my
first
berkshire
brew
and
i
say
well
done
d
moderate
a
big
boy
beer
had
me
sipping
it
slow
but
i
enjoyed
it

a
unique

tang
mild

subtle
citrus
hops
plus
caramel
and
toffee
surprisingly
not
rich
and
not
complex
even
and
full
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
becomes
tastier
as
it
warms
but
could
have
more
depth
of
flavor
a
strange
american
barleywine
with
a
more
earthy
hop
balance
and
not
so
much
bigbitterness
which
i
know
people
love
but
im
down
with
more
gentle
hoppy
barleywines
and
stouts

a

of

the
fruits
smell
pretty
sweet
but
the
malts
smell
nice
hard
for
me
to
pick
up
much
here
the
taste
is
pretty
much
like
a
standard
ale
huge
malt
backbone
almost
rye
tasting
the
hops
add
some
fruity
and
bitter
flavor
and
even
some
spice
the
strength
of
the
hops
is
not
too
high
which
i
like
in
a
barleywine
the
fruity
flavors
are
tasteful
and
add
a
nice
aspect
to
this
one
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
creamy
texture

carbonation
works
well
here
and
a
huge
coat
of

malts
is
on

no
warming
very
smooth
alcohol
comes
into
the
taste
later
on
in
the
beer
and
starts
to
take
away
from
it
the
price
is
ok
but
more
expensive
than
other
bbc

which
i
like
more

with

this

i
look

to
trying
some
more
brews
from

this
ones
a
keeper
worth
getting
more
of
d
its
a
solid
beer
i
would
almost
rather
they
just
call
it
a
strong
ale

it
lacks
some
of
the
essential
characteristics
of
most
barleywines
i
enjoy
syrupy
and
viscous
bold
flavors
light
carbonation
it
has
some
notes
on
the
palate
that
are
very
similar
to
their

i
wonder
if
that
is
intentional

not

buy
another

bitterness
and
warming
alcohol
this
barleywine
has
medium
carbonation
a
tasty
example
one
that
im
enjoying
on
a
chilly
early
spring
evening
along
with
a
nice
sharp
cheddar
lots
of
warm
ethanol
in
the
quaff
but
it
doesnt
distract
and
actually
adds
to
the
enjoyment
tasty
brew
drinks
well
on
a
cool
and
rainy
masters
golf
friday
mouthfeel
is
thick
a
bit
syrupy
with
a
fluffy
prickly
carbonation
that
just
matches
perfectly
with
the
prickly
hops
and
the
spicy
rye
would
try
this
again
if
given
the
chance
after
getting
pierced
again
i
needed
something
stiff
so
i
headed
to
the
daily
planet
where
i
got
this
american
barleywine
off
the
tap
it
was
a
classic
copper
color
with
one
finger
of
tan
head
the
retention
was
moderate
the
lacing
consistent
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
malt
pleasant
spices
a
little
mustiness
and
some
alcohol
the
flavors
were
well
balanced
caramel
malt
with
some
buttery
notes
almonds
in
the
middle
the
spices
again
hints
of
wood
and
a
nice
grapefruit
and
orange
presence
from
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
ultra
smooth
the
body
mediumfull
and
the
carbonation
dainty
enjoyable
and
punchy
just
was
the
piercing
artist
ordered
my
buddy
brought
me
a
bottle
back
from
vermont
and
i
really
wish
he
would
have
brought
more
great
flavors
and
not
too
overpowering
as
some
barley
wines
can
be
this
is
instantly
one
of
my
favorite
barley
wines
its
thick
and
chewy
but
smooth
buttery
and
oily
too
its
a
thick
and
rich
beer
a
smooth
barleywine
d
very
drinkable
for
what
this
is
we
split
this
and
it
was
enjoyable
really
nice
example
of
the
syle
d
could
not
drink
more
than
one
the
9
5
alcohol
is
hidden
but
the
beer
has
harsh
undertones
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
in
true
bbc
fashion
dark
reddishbrown
a
little
murky
with
a
great
two
inch
cream
colored
head
that
remained
a
while
and
left
sticky
lace
rings
why
do
we
love
that
so
much
smells
of
caramel
malt
and
herbal
hops
tastes
strongly
of
the
caramel
and
finishes
with
the
hops
and
alcohol
the
fullbodied
creamy
mouthfeel
and
warming
alcohol
make
this
sipper
a
solid
holiday
barleywine
hoppy
for
the
style
but
hops
are
so
hot
right
now
its
drinkable
and
has
the
usual
characteristics
for
the
style
with
some
aging
the
alcohol
warmth
may
calm
down
making
it
even
more
desirable
regardless
i
do
not
regret
purchasing
this
and
it
stands
out
as
an
excellent
example
of
its
style
first
impression
a
lot
hoppier
than
i
expected
from
a
barleywine
not
a
bitter
hop
presence
but
enough
that
the
malts
dont
clobber
me
over
the
head
with
sweetness
there
is
a
pineyness
here
not
so
much
from
the
hops
almost
like
christmastree
pine
little
bit
of
citrus
but
not
so
much
specifically
fruit
aside
from
the
hops
the
body
is
a
little
weak
not
really
watery
just
not
quite
so
much
of
a
malt
presence
as
i
was
expecting
which
detracts
a
bit
from
the
experience
neverless
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
mouthfeel
is
coating
yet
refreshing
drinkability
is
dangerously
high
i
could
sip
on
this
all
night
overall
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
more
than
i
expected
given
the
comments
of
worse
than
last

i
get
excited
for
this
beer
every
year
since
it
is
my
favorite
bbc
offering
i
have
the
luxury
of
drinking
at
work
so
i
grab
a
bottle
from
the
cooler
it
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
that
laces
the
glass
the
hops
smell
citrusy
almost
grassy
with
slight
alcohol
and
caramel
aromas
present
the
first
taste
has
the
hops
up
front
follwed
by
the
warm
caramel
malt
reminiscant
of
many
other
bbc
offerings
the
hops
move
to
the
background
as
the
beer
warms
this
ale
is
big
and
bold
one
per
night
should
be
more
than
enough
for
all
except
the
biggest

a

overall
solid
barleywine
but
its
not
without
its
flaws
lacks
the
depth
and
complexity
of
some
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
just
a
tad
bit
too
boozy
for
my
tastes
especially
considering
the
bit
of
age
it
has
on
it
id
definitely
drink
this
again
but
either
with
a
fresher
example
or
maybe
one
with
another
year
on
it
perhaps
right
now
this
vintage
is
stuck
in
that
awkward
teenage
puberty
phase
p
supremely
drinkable
barley
wine
style
ale
great
jumping
off
point
for
the
style
a
little
boozey
with
a
hint
of
grape
flavor
almost
like
a
wine
highly
recommended
if
you
can
find
it
just
not
a
fan
i
love
victory
but
this
is
not
their
finest
this
is
a
5
year
old
bottle
2009
and
is
spot
on
aged
beautifully
still
has
bitterness
but
balanced
with
the
rich
brown
sugar
bubblegum
cotton
candy
plum
malt
this
is
really
hitting
the
spot
on
a
snowy
day
in
pa
o
actually
held
up
quite
well
hops
are
totally
gone
but
not
a
surprise
given
the
age
very
nice
barleywine
reminds
me
a
bit
of
some
of
the
gratitude
vintage
bottles
but
not
quite
up
to
that
level
overall
good
stuff
honestly
borderline
english
barleywine
with
its
properties
with
its
complexity
sweet
bitter
that
honestly
i
would
pair
it
with
dessert
just
to
make
it
that
much
better
take
your
time
because
it
definitely
sneaks
up
on
you
salud
a
classic
english
barleywine
and
it
really
is
the
season
for
the
style
right
now
nothing
quite
warms
me
up
like
a
good
one
inside
and
out
this
is
cool
because
it
does
have
some
yeast
presence
remaining
a
slight
haze
in
the
beer
and
a
doughy
bready
middle
which
as
expected
goes
brilliantly
with
the
sweet
almost
desserty
caramel
malts
like
a
bread
pudding
really
cut
only
by
a
fruity
almost
brandy
boozy
element
that
unites
it
rather
well
all
the
requisite
elements
of
the
style
are
here
and
its
a
fine
example
of
it
but
in
this
particular
beer
the
come
together
to
form
one
of
those
style
definers
for
me
this
is
what
english
barleywine
really
is
and
should
be
suitable
for
ageing
but
ready
to
drink
right
now
not
devoid
of
hops
but
mellow
in
that
regard
balancing
bitterness
only
and
not
even
really
that
a
slow
drinker
share
please
but
a
staple
of
the
season
thats
for
sure
o
really
good
barleywine
here
certainly
something
i
could
add
to
the
yearly
winter
rotation
victory
is
quietly
a
very
very
solid
brewery

not
bad
by
any
means

not
my
favorite
either
on

at

a
low
carb
brown
aroma
is
sweet
malts
and
dark
fruit
taste
is
sweet
malts
and
fruit
with
a
semi
dry
finish
o
overall
for
a
big
barleywine
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
as
the
alcohol
is
not
overwhelming
or
dominating
in
the
flavor
i
think
it
is
a
little
bettermellower
with
a
year
of
age
on
it
than
i
remember
it
being
fresh
tasty
mouthfeel
is
slick
with
very
light
carbonation
a
thick
chewy
body
that
felt
like
a
fresh
squeezed
juice
at
times
and
watery
at
others
moderate
bitterness
average
sweetness
for
the
style
hoppy
and
fruity
enough
so
the
alcohol
stays
tolerable
this
was
very
tasty
and
very
complex
getting
better
as
it
warmed
up
and
letting
the
11
abv
knock
me
around
enough
to
maximize
the
barleywine
experience
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
and
will
have
it
again
knocked
me
out
for
sure
overall
blend
of
fruit
flavors
are
quite
pleasant
darker
fruits
and
brighter
fruits
strike
a
beautiful
balance
molasses
and
caramel
sweetness
from
the
malts
make
for
a
wonderful
backbone
and
feel
to
the
beer
a
very
forward
bitterness
punches
in
at
the
back
end
toastier
malts
ever
so
slight

character
remaining

with
some

pours
dark

with
a
very

the
beer
is
lacy
with
some
legs
very
big
chewy
malt
on
the
palate
that
starts
sweet
with
molasses
brown
sugar
a
suspicion
of
bourbon
joined
by
plum
and
fruit
becoming
bitter
with
big
alcohol
flavors
on
the
finish
full
bodied
with
medium
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
bit
unorthodox
but
exceedingly
interesting
and
decadently
different
one
of
the
better
barley
wines
good
flavor
of
malt
with
some
hops
bitterness
no
alcohol
up
front
o
this
beer
is
holding
up
decently
well
but
for
7
years
old
its
definitely
falling
off
a
tiny
bit
id
say
it
probably
reached
its
peak
a
couple
years
ago
as
marked
by
the
enjoy
by
date
its
still
very
enjoyable
and
extremely
smooth
for
11
for
picking
this
up
off
the
shelf
recently
for
5
id
say
it
was
a
steal
o
held
up
really
well
after
all
these
years
complex
and
drinkable
the
booziness
was
welcome
overall
what
an
incredible
beer
i
love
a
lot
of
what
victory
does
and
i
love
a
lot
of
different
barleywines
but
this
beer
ranks
right
up
there
near
the
top
of
both
categories
prior
to
this
beer
the
only
time
i
ever
had
it
was
when
i
had
a
2009
oaked
variation
in
2013
which
was
incredible
i
thought
i
would
be
let
down
a
bit
by
this
relatively
fresh
bottle
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
it
exceeding
my
expectations
the
hop
character
that
was
all
but
lost
on
the
2009
created
a
fantastic
compliment
to
the
complex
malt
bill
i
have
two
more
bottles
which
were
both
going
to
go
in
the
cellar
after
tasting
this
now
however
its
drinking
too
good
not
to
pull
at
least
one
more
out
of
the
cellar
real
soon
the
beer
is

that

somewhat

of

complexities
its
a

hot
and
would
probably
age
well
this
ones
only
a

a

buttery
as
it

overall
i
honestly
expected
a
little
more
from
victory
not
that
this
beer
wasnt
good
cause
it
was
just
not
anything
special
decent
price
about
8
bucks
for
a
11

bomber
but
i
still
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again

never
cloying

a
very
enjoyable
barleywine
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
overall
i
enjoyed
this
barleywine
nice
job
victory
classic
american
barley
wine
very
much
like
bigfoot
though
bigger
in
every
way
except
the
aroma
intensely
hoppy
and
spicy
the
one
drawback
might
be
the
near
eclipse
of
malty
sweetness
by
the
tannic
wine
and
citrus
bitterness
nothing
a
bit
of
cellaring
wont
cure
odas
plain
as
it
gets
in
terms
of
the
style
something
can
be
said
for
its
longevity
as
a
highly
praised
barleywine
i
prefer
mine
with
a
bit
kore
complexity
another
winner
from

m

for
a
22oz
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
low
c
this
is
my
first
barley
wine
so
i
am
not
sure
what
to
expect
decent
looking
beer
that
smells
very
tasty
does
not
quite
fulfill
that
good
but
nothing
great
normally
a
fan
of
big
beers
so
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
improved
as
it
warmed
and
the
alcohol
contact
kicked
in
which
impressed
me
decent
value
also
at
7
super
just
super
odoesnt
feel
balanced
but
the
flavors
dont
fight
between
them
they
just
coexist
interesting
flavors
coming
from
it
but
probably
not
enough
to
try
it
again
overall
sometimes
american
barleywines
come
off
too
astringent
and
need
a
little
aging
but
this
one
has
some
nice
balance
while
still
lending
towards
hoppiness
great
malty
profile
with
a
biting
hoppines
overlying
it
poured
into
a
snifter
looks
ruddy
reddish
brown
with
a
surprisingly
frothy
light
tan
head
that
leaves
some
bubbles
behind
for
good
measure
smells
like
halls
grocery
my
favorite
beer
store
not
sure
what
that
means
wood
oranges
roses
caramel
and
its
making
my
mouth
water
the
taste
is
woody
biscuity
with
a
bit
of
a
medicinal
taste
but
in
a
good
way
it
is
drier
than
i
expected
nice
clean
finish
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
mild
carbonation
and
is
very
slick
and
nicely
viscous
overall
i
really
like
this
the
surprising
carbonation
and
the
delightful
smell
really
make
it
one
of
my
favorite
ive
had
of
the
style
overall
not
bad
i
was
shocked
that
i
never
had
this
beer
before
im
pretty
sure
this
wasnt
bottled
for
2012
so
that
might
be
the
main
reason
ive
never
had
this
not
the
most
balanced
easy
to
drink
beer
but
its
decent
enough
strong
full
flavored
with
alcohol
in
each
sip
worth
a
drink
but
not
world
class
pours
a
reddish
caramel
body
with
a
thin
head
hops
are
prevalent
in
the
nose
pineapple
citrus
oils
pine
soft
caramel
and
toffee
malt
aromas
lie
beneath
the
hops
flavors
are
more
hopforwarded
with
a
long
lingering
bitterness
a
lot
of
citrus
and
pine
malt
sweetness
is
definitely
there
but
isnt
overthetop
im
blown
away
at
how
well
the
11
abv
is
hidden
mouthfeel
is
mild
in
carbonation
and
moderate
in
body
not
too
sticky
considering
the
sweetness
overall
a
very
good
american
barleywine
not
mindblowing
but
wholly
good
this
is
a
very
solid
barleywine
it
has
all
of
the
classic
characteristics
that
one
would
look
for
in
the
style
it
might
not
be
a
mind
blowing
experience
but
the
craftsmanship
is
impressive
its
ultimately
an
enjoyable
experience
o
not
something
id
pick
up
again
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
i
was
looking
for
a
more
complex
sweet
beer
i
guess
i
should
have
gone
for
a
more
english
style
barlywine
a
pretty
good
dark
honey
colored
barleywine
with
a
definite
alcohol
kick
to
it
relatively
easy
drinking
enough
depth
and
complexity
to
make
the
tasting
quite
enjoyable
and
a
nice
way
to
end
an
evening
with
your
wife
dog
a
warm
fire
and
a
snowy
evening
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
brew
definitely
one
of
the
top
american
barley
wines
that
i
have
tried
at
8
a
bomber
it
might
become
a
staple
for
me
medium
to
full
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
grapefruit
and
caramel
aftertaste
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
an
11
abv
beer
well
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
should
age
nicely
there
seems
to
be
less
fruit
and
toffee
in
this
beer
however
the
transition
from
the
mf
to
the
taste
is
excellent
there
is
stylistic
coherence
in
this
beer
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
a
pretty
solid
example
of
a
hoppy
barleywine
the
hop
profile
was
pretty
nice
and
it
worked
well
with
the
malts
and
it
for
sure
isnt
one
of
the
sweeter
barleywines
which
i
didnt
mind
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
wasnt
the
smoothest
rich
a
little
filing
but
the
taste
did
a
decent
job
at
holding
my
attention
and
i
think
half
the
bottle
is
a
good
amount
for
me
i
could
drink
the
whole
bottle
but
i
would
rather
split
it
since
i
really
dont
feel
the
need
to
have
another
glass
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
hop
profile
and
the
appearance
i
thought
they
were
both
pretty
good
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
i
thought
it
could
be
smoother
and
a
little
less
carbonated
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
it
was
nice
to
try
but
i
tend
to
prefer
my
barleywines
on
the
sweet
and
malty
side
and
if
i
wanted
a
barleywine
that
was
on
the
hoppy
side
i
would
rather
have
a
bigfoot
i
would
recommend
this
to
people
who
prefer
their
barleywines
on
the
hoppy
side
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
hoppy
barleywine
but
it
isnt
my
favorite
of
the
style
and
i
think
it
was
just
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
nice
work
guys
this
was
a
solid
hoppy
barleywine
o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
barleywinesand
i
greatly
prefer
them
with
some
agebut
this
was
pretty
good
the
last
bw
i
drank
was
an
old
foghorn
and
this
was
much
better
at
least
to
my
taste
so
im
rating
on
style
not
preference
but
ill
remember
victory
next
year
when
i
want
to
stock
the
cellari
have
one
more
bomber
in
there
right
now
that
ill
save
and
might
buy
another
while
its
available
other
than
a
not
that
compelling
aroma
fairly
common
with
beers
featuring
both
big
malt
and
big
hops
in
my
experience
this
is
a
really
good
american
bw
overall
a
very
good
take
on
the
american
barley
wine
style
great
balance
of
sweet
and
bready
malt
with
the
bold
hops
o
a
classic
barleywine
thats
been
due
for
a
comeback
so
balanced
so
tasty
o
this
is
pretty
nice
but
the
old
hop
bitterness
is
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
i
liked
the
barrelaged
version
because
the
barrel
smoothed
out
the
hops
a
bit
o
decent
barleywine
though
it
may
have
needed
some
cellaring
2014
goal
learn
to
exhibit
patience
with
purchased
beverages
that
benefit
from
aging
no
guarantees
o
a
sweet
and
boozy
barleywine
with
victory
house
malts
not
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
i
guess
the
age
hasnt
done
the
beer
well
its
boozy
oxidized
and
too
piney
and
herbal
bitter
o
give
this
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
and
this
would
kick
ass
right
now
though
its
still
drinking
pretty
damn
well
if
the
sweetness
was
more
defined
then
it
would
be
killer
immediately
as
it
stands
im
really
enjoying
the
hop
profile
but
wished
the
malt
component
worked
a
little
better
edit
i
have
since
been
told
that
i
should
have
had
this
at
a
warmer
temperature
i
drank
it
at
refridgerator
temperature
so
maybe
ill
try
it
again
sometime
o
a
nice
american
barleywine
that
is
well
put
together
and
has
a
great
balance
between
malt
hops
and
alcohol
a
perfect
winter
sipper
and
a
great
candidate
for
aging
definitely
recommended

this

may
be
my
two
favorite
of
the
style
excellent
overall
a
nice
amount
of
bitterness
to
balance
a
malty
beer
pretty
good
o
ive
been
drinking
this
6pk
over
the
course
of
the
years
and
its
been
pretty
good
this
is
the
second
to
last
and
its
definitely
showing
signs
of
age
now
nice
super
sugary
sweetness
and
well
integrated
flavors
and
mellowness
super
easy
drinking
oxidation
is
starting
to
show
up
in
the
aftertaste
i
should
have
the
last
one
pretty
soon
i
guess
overall
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
had
and
i
love
barleywine
i
can
not
underscore
how
much
more
amazing
this
is
with
5
years
of
age
on
it
better
than
the
oak
horizontal
and
that
was
amazing
you
really
have
to
watch
yourself
drinking
this
it
is
so
smooth
and
absent
in
boozy
taste
uncharacteristic
for
new
years
that
you
really
can
end
up
pretty
trashed
in
no
time
and
not
think
much
of
it
i
think
this
beer
is
a
solid
a
on
any
given
year

this

of

dont

if

and

a

this

this

of

improving
with

especially
with

exactly
what

the

has
a
nose
of

with

off

the

the
slight

this

nice

a

this
knocked
me
on

and
not

there
is
a
nice
sugary
sweet
with

on
the

the
beer
is
quite
sweet
and
have
a
rich
caramel
flavour
with
a

of
chocolate
the
sweetness
almost
reminds
me
of
cherries
not
very
many
hops
in
this
beer
leaving
me
to
wonder
what
it
would
taste
like
with
some
age

it
pretty
good

and
i
think
its
the
overwhelming
sweetness
and
burnt
toffee
flavors
dominating
the
palate
id
really
like
more
bready
malts
to
even
it
all
out
maybe
its
in
an
awkward
phase
of
transition
at
one

id
certainly
give

i
see
this

like
a

most
of

the

the

pretty

thanks
to
nero
for
providing
a
wonderful
brew
notes
not
a
bad
barleywine
it
has
mellowed
out
a
bit
though
lets
see
how
another
year
or
two
do
for
it
this
is
a
serious
barleywine
luxurious
complex
and
contemplative
the
smell
has
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
a
concentrated
malt
aroma
also
there
is
a
smell
of
ripe
fruit
and
citrus
along
with
background
whiffs
of
hops
the
first
taste
is
of
dark
berries
and
cherry
the
beer
is
a
jumble
of
full
and
rich
flavors
the
alcohol
is
highly
evident
but
not
overpowering
and
the
beer
has
a
terrific
strong
hop
finish
what
a
treat
delicious
garnet
in
hue
and
brillantly
clear
w
the
initially
thick
light
tan
head
readily
receding
into
a
thin
glass
coating
ring
a
snap
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
in
aroma
immediately
yields
to
a
well
rounded
orange
like
but
not
grapefruity
citrusy
hop
nose
rich
buttery
toffee
and
fruity
esters
reminescent
of
prune
a
waft
of
heaty
but
pleasant
ethanol
rounds
the
aroma
out
and
is
a
harbinger
of
a
potent
brew
molasses
sweetness
hits
the
palate
initially
then
is
quickly
offset
by
assertive
but
clean
hop
bitterness
which
in
turn
fades
mellow
diacetyl
then
surfaces
along
with
toasty
munich
notes
while
honey
notes
add
depth
to
the
malt
sweetness
hop
flavor
is
nearly
lost
amongst
the
sweetish
malt
but
citrus
manages
to
persist
moderately
bodied
w
a
smooth
agreeable
mouthfeel
that
helps
lend
dangerous
drinkability
finishes
with
lingering
biscuit
notes
and
hop
bitters
old
horizontal
is
a
delicious
barleywine
a
22
ounce
bottle
wouldve
been
appreciated
its
inherent
complexity
renders
the
12
oz
portion
insufficent
give
me
more
got
this
one
on
a
trade
thanks
to
a
gentleman
in
ny
its
pretty
obvious
how
this
one
got
its
name
alcohol
taste
is
at
the
forefront
very
enjoyable
when
you
take
your
time
with
it
you
wont
be
pounding
these
back
kind
of
the
beer
version
of
a
port
wine
all
in
all
a
great
barley
wine
which
makes
me
want
to
try
other
ones
the
old
horizontal
1
year
old
opens
with
a
sharp
hiss
it
pours
a
clear
deep
rubyorangecopper
the
aroma
is
equally
malt
and
hop
alongside
some
sweet
fruity
esters
the
flavor
starts
with
a
candyish
malt
followed
quickly
by
a
brash
hoppiness
there
is
a
noticeable
alcohol
in
the
finish
followed
by
an
agressive
hop
dryness
the
hop
flavor
lingers
although
the
body
doesnt
indicate
a
syrupy
quality
this
beer
is
a
bit
cloying
very
much
a
brandy
snifter
barleywine
more
over
the
top
than
most
barleywines
but
thats
what
victorys
all
about
isnt
it
pours
a
shortlived
tan
head
reddishbrown
with
yeast
in
suspension
nose
is
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
no
hops
taste
is
first
a
very
quick
burst
of
sweetness
followed
by
fusel
alcohol
burn
nice
luxurious
long
finish
hops
are
here
but
hiding
in
the
background
but
oh
what
a
background
long
maltyhoppy
finish
this
is
a
big
beer
that
lets
you
know
upfront
what
you
are
in
for
a
beer
with
balls
an
excellent
nightcap
beer
pours
a
very
dark
amber
with
almost
no
head
the
smell
is
very
strong
alcohol
and
caramel
sweet
maltiness
the
alcohol
is
present
throughout
the
taste
and
it
provides
a
nice
warming
sensation
the
maltiness
hits
and
is
nice
and
sweet
on
the
tongue
but
not
a
sticky
cloying
sweetness
as
the
malt
flavors
begin
to
fade
there
is
a
very
nice
balancing
bitterness
that
is
brought
on
by
the
hops
the
maltiness
has
some
nice
complexities
there
is
some
dark
fruit
some
woodiness
and
a
nice
full
chewy
maltiness
nice
and
smooth
and
fairly
drinkable
for
a
barley
wine
i
was
a
little
dissappointed
with
this
brew
dont
get
me
wrong
it
was
very
good
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
outstanding
since
it
was
from
victory
this
could
develop
very
nicely
with
some
cellaring
though
all
praise
be
to
venom
and
even
more
praise
for
sending
two

the

one

the

which

very
very

this
is
truly
a
sipping
beer
a
great
experience
deep
gold
with
orange
hues
under
a
thin

this
beer
stunned
me
with
its
full
thick
mouthfeel
chewy
and
delicious
like
a
meal
in
a
glass
sweet
fruity
malts
are
balanced
by
the
sharp
well
attenuated
hop
flavors
anytime
i
see
a
victory
product
on
tap
i
feel
assured
of
a
quality
well
made
beer
in
the
glass
if
someone
were
to
take
a
anchor
christmas
2000
and
cross
it
with
a
hoppy
barleywine
it
would
taste
close
to
but
not
quite
as
good
as
this
an
exceptionally
good
barleywine
heaven
in
a
glass
a
deep
orange
hue
with
just
a
little
haziness
in
it
intense
aroma
of
spice
and
citrus
the
taste
is
a
perfect
balance
of
fruit
pine
and
spice
amazing
and
plenty
of
alcohol
to
keep
you
toasty
exceptional
beer
all
the
way
around
victory
brewing
absolutely
kicks
ass
beautiful
dark
ruby
color
with
cascading
reddish
tan
head
that
lasts
strong
hop
with
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
orangegrapefruit
zest
in
the
aroma
not
just
a
beer
but
a
malty
sweet
hopped
up
flavor
savoring
experience
an
excellent
baley
wine
closely
resembles
old
domion
millenium
as
i
understand
it
the
victory
head
brewer
did
the
original
recipe
for
millenium
and
this
new
recipe
incorporates
subtle
adjustments
to
make
it
an
equally
impressive
retains
the
strong
hop
balance
and
carbonation
that
i
like
mouthfeel
was
heavy
and
thick
with
a
weighty
feel
and
a
slickness
that
went
down
smooth
there
was
hardly
any
carbonation
and
the
aftertaste
was
sweet
and
malty
with
very
low
bitterness
and
a
light
alcohol
fade
it
got
more
complicated
and
interesting
as
it
sat
in
the
glass
so
im
glad
i
let
this
develop
for
a
while
since
it
was
pretty
tasty
a
different
kind
of
barleywine
but
good
overall
aged
for
two
years
so
much
better
than
fresh
its
like
a
different
beer
do
not
drink
this
fresh
age
it
and
let
it
become
the
beer
it
wants
to
be
aroma
like
honeysuckle
and
grapefruit
pours
a
clear
orange
amber
body
with
thick
creamy
whit

luxurious
lacing
on

taste
is
very
complex
boozy
and
fruited
at

time
odd
slightly
unpleasant
aftertaste
odefinitely
hit
or
miss
in
enjoyment
an
acquired
taste
one
will
dissect
certain
traits
they
like
of
the
beer
there
definitely
is
something
in
it
all
can
pinpoint
and
say
that
they
like
about
griffins
bow
it
does
taste
too
sweet
and
woodsy
though
but
maybe
that
is
the
point
with
a
barley
wine
keep
in
mind
an
adventurous
style
would
only
drink
to
get
buzzed
a
cheap
bomber
wont
hurt
your
pocket
an
ok
beer
in
some
places
really
nice
in
others
wicked
sweet
but
has
lots
of
depth
and
complexity
dangerously
drinkable
a
really
hard
beer
to
grade
22
ounce
bottle
batch
1
from
what
ive
read
this
bottle
is
about
2
years
old
now
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
an
inch
or
so
frothy
offwhite
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
while
theres
also
a
lot
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
oak
citrusy
hops
pineapple
grapefruit
mango
bready
and
caramel
malt
and
some
floralness
it
tastes

pineapple
mango
coconut
vanilla
toffee
and
some
earthiness
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
creamy
and
slick
with
a
good
amount

i
liked
this
brew
a
lot
its
one
that
i
thought
was
better
and
better
the
longer
i
drank
it
its
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
come
across
it
id
like
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
of
this
in
the
future
but
it
does
age
well
light
hazy
amber
almost
golden
smell
orange
tangerine
a
little
alcohol
taste
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
overpowering
not
much
else
comes
through
other
than
a
little
pine
mouth
feel
some
alcohol
burn
heavy
carbonation
overall
the
appearance
and
smell
are
the
high
points
maybe
with
a
little
aging
it
can
achieve
a
little
more
balance
o
starts
with
a
fairly
inviting
and
complex
bouquet
taste
is
good
tons
of
complexity
keeps
it
interesting
sip
after
sip
like
all
the
small
batch
brews
from
sam
adams
this
ones
certainly
worth
a
try
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
different
i
dont
know
why
this
beer
doesnt
score
better
i
think
its
quite
nice
really
nice
pineapple
flavors
blend
with
honey
and
toffee
nicely

of

great

and

on
for

a

offering
poured
into
a
chalice
a
very
nice
cloudy
orange
color
very
nice
carbonation
with
a
very
nice

plus
creamy
thick
offwhite

which
leaves
some
very
nice
sticky
lacing
with
a
huge
oil
slick
in
the
middle
the
nose
is
mostly
malty
with
some
nice
hop
notes
fruity
with
a
slight
grapefruit
note
the
taste
is
malty
with
some
hops
and
fruity
medium
body
overall
a
pretty
tasty
brew
but
does
not
really
remind
me
of
a
bwsa
overall
not
a
big
fan
of
barleywines
this
one
was
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
barleywine
not
a
bad
brew
my
brotherinlaw
had
a
bottle
at
a
party
he
was
hosting
i
usually
dont
go
for
barley
wine
and
like
a
product
with
a
little
less
alcohol
content
but
griffins
bow
was
a
pleasant
surprise
it
was
smooth
and
didnt
taste
like
it
was
strong
i
would
certainly
buy
this
myself
and
will
enjoy
every
drop
o
this
beer
has
lots
of
nice
complexity
that
is
a
bit
subtle
but
really
grows
as
does
the
richness
of
malt
flavor
the
green
fresh
oak
blends
really
nicely
with
the
hops
and
pale
malt
flavor
very
good
sipper
overall
this
is
the
very
first
batch
of
this
beer
i
bought
it
back
in
late
2011
and
have
been
sitting
on
it
waiting
for
all
the
goodness
to
marinate
i
have
to
say
it
was
worth
the
wait
i
might
have
to
go
out
and
buy
another
bottle
and
drink
it
in
2015
o
very
nice
i
really
like
this
i
was
afraid
of
a
big
malt
bomb
but
this
is
balanced
really
well
pretty
complex
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
notice
nice
work
for
samuel
adams
they
are
hit
and
miss
with
a
lot
of
their
creative
beers
at
least
they
are
trying
and
they
always
have
something
new
to
check
out
this
one
is
a
winner
in
my
book
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
flavor
is
interesting
with
the
lighter
blond
note
coupled
with
the
woodiness
a
lot
of
flavor
in
this
beer
but
it
leans
towards
the
sweet
side
overall
it
was
decent
if
perhaps
more
than
a
bit
on
the
raw
side
with
such
a
high
abv
though
it
may
well
lend
itself
to
further
aging
overall
a
decent
barleywine
the
hops
balance
the
sweetness
in
a
way
that
makes
it
easy
to
drink
more
perhaps
this
is
a
downside
at
11
5
it
is
not
stupendously
amazing
but
neither
is
it
priced
as
such
tried
about
7
different
barleywines
at
a
tasting
last
night
with
griffins
bow
being
the
4th
bottle
opened
compared
to
the
dark
richness
of
aleworks
old
numbskull
the
agressiveness
of
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
or
the
balanced
nuances
of
avery
brewing
companys
hog
heaven
samuel
adams
barleywine
was
completely
pedestrian
and
did
nothing
to
impress
us
or
stand
above
the
competition
it
wasnt
that
it
was
a
bad
beer
but
griffins
bow
lacked
any
of
the
characteristics
that
i
enjoy
in
a
barleywine
interested
in
trying
it
again
on
its
own
maybe
id
enjoy
it
more
if
i
didnt
have
exceptional
barleywines
to
compare
it
to
o
the
aging
on
toasted
oak
and
use
of
nelson
sauvin
hops
definitely
make
this
an
interesting
and
unique
barleywine
it
definitely
tastes
like
an
american
barleyine
with
all
of
the
hop
flavors
but
there
isnt
that
much
associated
bitterness
or
stickiness
that
you
see
in
other
beers
in
this
style
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
i
expected
samuel
adams
did
a
great
job
with
this
beer
o
i
tip
my
hat
to
sam
adams
for
pushing
the
envelope
with
a
blonde

phenolic

at
a
measly

but
i
do
almost
taste
a
bit
of
buttery
notes
that
could
come
through
a
little
more
with
age
at
warmer
temperatures
the
alcohol
takes
over
and
smoothers
the
tropical
fruitiness
of
the
hops
and
becomes
less
tolerable
at
times
and
im
no
slouch
that
stays
away
from

just
saying
it

definitely
worth
a
try
overall
fantastic
o
could
use
a
bit
more
sweetness
but
to
do
so
would
likely
mess
up
the
color
they
were
going
for
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
would
probably
get
better
reviews
as
an
ipa
than
a
barleywine
i
found
this
beer
to
be
amazing
from
the
fruity
smell
upon
sniffing
the
freshly
opened
bottle
to
the
orgy
of
flavors
upon
taking
my
first
sip
it
was
truly
a
unique
flavor
and
a
beautiful
experience
sam
adams
brewery
has
quite
a
few
of
these
fusion
beers
and
i
found
this
one
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
a
must
try
pleasant
refreshing
barleywine
orange
flavour
well
malted
big
malty

aroma
is
weedy
nelson
sauvin
hops
although
well
concealed
to
me
as
was
the
barrel
aging
ipa
level
hoppiness
depth
booze
well
hidden
thanks
for
sharing
ken
good
drinkability
it
also
mars
an
otherwise
clean
feel
especially
given
a
nice
creamy
smoothness
crispness
is
light
as
is
the
carbonation
but
theres
enough
of
each
to
keep
things
going
although
most
of
boston
beer
co
s
offerings
have
been
pretty
pedestrian
this
one
stands
out
great
looking
beer
with
a
solid
nose
and
flavor
this
ones
an
undertheradar
beer
that
deserves
a
shoutout
overall
i
loved
this
cause
i
like
the
oak
and
pine
combination
this
borderline
has
too
much
going
on
but
i
would
love
to
get
this
again
and
age
it
some
very
enjoyable
and
a
winner
in
my
book
d
might
be
much
better
with
some
age
on
it
probably
years
but
pretty
much
sucks
as
is
its
hardly
even
drinkable
o
i
only
had
a
pilsener
glass
full
and
i
could
only
finish
half
of
it
before
dumping
the
rest
out
there
are
some
nice
hints
here
and
there
but
this
is
an
otherwise
terrible
barleywine
thats
far
too
experimental
for
its
own
good
avoid
pours
a
clear
orange
with
one
finger
of
offwhite
foam
settles
to
a
thin
layer
with
a
few
spots
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
pineapple
vanilla
caramel
taste
grassy
medicinal
lemon
butterscotch
candy
messy
boozy
and
sweet
medium
bodied
but
thins
out
considerably
finishing
dry
with
unpleasant
astringency
so
far
these
small
batch
releases
had
been
pretty
solid
but
this
one
is
rough
batch
2
taste
starts
out
with
a
sweet
caramel
malt
front
a
bit
sticky
picking
up
hints
of
heat
and
alcohol
but
its
surprisingly
well
hidden
considering
the
strength
citrusy
fruity
hops
creep
in
and
lend
a
nice
balance
to
the
malt
sweetness
hardly
any
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
from
the
hop
presence
carbonation
is
moderate
and
lends
a
nice
feel
to
the
mouth
strong
aroma
is
mainly
like
freshcut
oak
wood
but
once
you
pour
this
releases
subtle
malty
and
pear
scents
plus
an
alcohol
nip
it
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
pretty
clear
golden
amber
with
a
very
thick
finebubbled
and
rather
persistent
pale
golden
head
syrupy
flavor
has
a
malty
core
and
a
firm
woody
component
clearly
from
the
oaking
a
strong
but
not
fierce
alcohol
bite
and
a
subtle
fruity
underpinning
plus
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
thick
syrupy
texture
has
a
good
amount
of
fizz
and
leaves
a
tingly
lively
finish
you
feel
this
one
as
it
heads
downstairs
this
robust
beer
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
anybody
who
appreciates
a
bold
brew
or
a
good
barleywine
should
enjoy
this
one
youd
hardly
know
that
samuel
adams
is
one
of
the
big
boys
they
sure
have
retained
their
craft
beer
attitude
a
soso
american
bw
with
some
flaws
first
of
all
it
says
its
oaked
but
the
oak
is
practically
undetectable
secondly
the
flavor
is
just
a
bit
unbalanced
the
nose
is
a
bit
bland
and
the
taste
manages
to
be
both
very
hoppy
and
not
at
all
bitter
all
that
aside
its
not
a
terrible
beer
and
probably
not
the
worst
bw
ive
had
but
it
leaves
room
for
improvement
i
hope
sam
adams
will
continue
with
this
series
of
beers
and
with
some
bws
in
particular
again
overall
i
often
think
more
highly
of
sam
adams
offerings
than
the
ba
averages
but
this
one
not
so
much
overall
will
be
honest
sam
adams
has
made
great
beer
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
average
at
best
the
taste
with
the
feel
of
wood
slight
slight
floral
pieces
of
citrus
skin
and
caramel
with
all
this
blah
doesnt
hurt
to
try
it
but
better
places
to
spend
youre
hard
earned
money
salud
o
im
all
for
experimentation
of
styles
but
this
is
a
case
where
things
just
went
awry
this
is
a
strange
unfocused
beer
interesting
beer
an
oaked
blonde
barleywine
good
combination
and
enjoyable
its
a
clear
brazedgolden
color
with
a
moderately
stable
white
head
its
an
attractive
beer
for
sure
the
aroma
is
of
hot
alcohol
pale
malt
earth
there
is
a
woody
oaklike
character
as
well
but
it
sits
behind
the
other
flavors
some
hops
in
the
aroma
but
theyre
restrained
the
taste
is
quite
good
however
powerful
sweet
woody
bitter
and
mouthnumbing
its
not
subtle
but
is
balanced
and
enjoyable
the
alcohol
is
notable
but
not
distracting
bitterness
begins
in
the
foretaste
and
doesnt
really
end
full
in
body
and
extraordinarily
heavy
this
beer
is
more
heavyhanded
than
its
appearance
foretells
i
dont
have
a
whole
lot
of
experience
drinking
barleywines
but
i
dont
think
this
is
one
ill
be
dying
to
revisit
anytime
soon
i
was
excited
at
first
because
i
like
sam
adams
disappointing
overall
the
complexity
of
a
barleywine
is
there
but
the
taste
seems
a
bit
unbalanced
as
far
as
barleywines
go
this
one
suggests
more
elegance
and
finess
as
any
ive
encountered
it
reminds
me
of
some
earlier
behemoth
blond
barleywines
from
three
floyds
this
beer
tastes
like
overly
bitter
citrus
rind
alcohol
and
wood
i
would
rather
use
it
to
clean
my
kitchen
floor
than
drink
it
again
maybe
it
will
become
drinkable
in
a
few
years
this
is
a
horrible
barleywine
almost
a
drain
pour
i
shouldve
known
there
was
something
up
with
the
amount
of
foam
on
this
brew
that
this
was
going
to
be
off
but
way
the
hell
off
nice
full
copperamber
colored
body
with
a
thick
foamy
offwhite
head
grapefruit
pineapple
oak
barley
oats
and
some
hints
of
caramel
and
honey
on
the
aroma
lots
of
complex
smoky
flavors
as
well
honeysuckle
toasted
oats
and
sugared
fruits
on
the
initial
sip
big
boozy
oak
flavored
kick
follows
quickly
on
the
high
side
of
complexity
with
a
mishmash
of
flavors
embodying
the
overall
organization
of
the
brew
i
can
find
everything
from
apples
pineapple
grapefruit
to
things
like
limes
and
carrots
pale
malts
and
malted
barley
with
a
smooth
rich
bready
texture
flat
pale
aftertaste
coming
from
someone
with
a
softspot
for
sam
brews
this
is
not
very
impressive
whatsoever
proceed
with
caution
the
aftertaste
was
just
as
good
as
the
initial
taste
i
will
be
drinking
this
one
again
perhaps
it
may
change
my
mind
towards
barley
wine
i
have
a
lot
of
faith
in
this
brewery
but
this
is
the
second
of
their
special
lines
i
have
found
thoroughly
unenjoyable
overall
this
was
like
drinking
a
cream
soda
with
hops
not
good
pours
a
clear
burnt
orange
color
with
a
two
finger
soapy
white
head
which
gives
way
to
skim
gobs
of
lace
are
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
caramel
and
sugar
with
a
touch
of
the
sauvian
hop
the
taste
has
a
caramel
and
sweet
backbone
before
a
touch
earthy
hop
the
sauvian
hop
along
with
a
candied
flavor
and
a
touch
of
oak
finish
out
the
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
low
to
moderately
carbonated
overall
it
is
a
solid
beer
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
the
taste
but
it
ends
up
coming
together
o
not
bad
for
a
young
barleywine
but
not
fantastic
either
i
will
pick
some
more
of
this
up
as
i
feel
it
has
good
ageing
potential
22oz

lemon
lime

come

straggle
in
toward
the
end
albeit
ever
so
lightly
medium
to
heavy
bodied
with
moderate
to
low
carbonation
not
bad
but
my
least
favorite
of
the
series
so
far
could
probably
stand
to
be
aged
a
bit
wow
the
pineapple
punches
you
in
the
face
along
with
some
dank
herb
and
tropical
alcohol
interesting
very
nice
malthop
interplay
and
the
hop
spectrum
is
terriffic
from
flavoring
to
bittering
the
oak
takes
on
a
big
role
as
it
warms
and
the
initial
hop
surge
fades
away
there
isnt
really
anyplace
for
the
big
11
5
abv
to
hide
and
it
shows
it
accentuated
even
by
the
wood
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
perfectly
carbonated
and
is
neither
too
syrupy
nor
thin
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
hits
some
high
notes
but
is
also
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
on
one
hand
aging
it
might
smooth
out
and
intigrate
the
beer
but
then
you
would
lose
the
nice
tropical
hop
flavors
id
probably
buy
another
one
of
these
not
a
bad
price
tag
at

so
not
good
but

a
huge
foamy
head
tops
a
bright
gold
to
amber
beer
a
bit
pale
for
a
barleywine
the
head
is
slow
to
settle
and
tends
to
throw
a
lot
of
lace
the
smell
is
a
little
weak
there
is
a
good
deal
of
oak
a
bit
of
light
fruitiness
along
with
pale
malt
and
a
note
of
alcohol
the
taste
follows
the
smell
with
the
oak
in
the
forefront
followed
by
a
juicy
sweet
almost
syrup
like
flavor
hop
character
is
relatively
light
and
is
only
really
prevalent
in
the
finish
the
body
of
this
beer
is
very
smooth
with
low
to
moderate
carbonation
up
front
things
are
very
sweet
but
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
and
quite
dry
the
alcohol
is
restrained
at
first
and
masked
by
the
sweetness
but
it
builds
with
time
its
a
big
bottle
overall
this
is
an
interesting
barleywine
i
am
put
more
in
mind
of
a
restrained
english
style
barleywine
than
its
typically
more
robust
american
cousin
maybe
with
some
time
the
flavors
would
blend
a
bit
and
mellow
out
some
overall
its
a
good
offering
and
im
glad
to
have
gotten
a
chance
to
sample
it
the
taste
has
an
interesting
mix
of
sweet
fruity
flavors
theres
a
light
layer
of
malty
toffee
initially
but
youll
quickly
find
some
honeylike
notes
hitting
the
palate
along
with
pineapple
some
rindy
grapefruit
a
bit
of
green
apple
and
pear
i
can
pick
up
a
bit
of
the
oak
character
and
vanilla
but
only
because
i
know
its
there
i
would
not
have
noticed
had
the
label
not
pointed
it
out
with
the
finish
leaning
to
the
dry
side
the
pithy
citrus
aspect
is
what
lingers
a
bit
in
the
end
doesnt
seem
too
barleywinelike
to
me
more
of
different
type
of
ipa
still
i
am
enjoying
this
as
well
as
the
other
new
experimental
sammy
offerings

turn
hideous
i
have
a
2nd
bottle
i
bought
at
the
same
time
ill
drink
it
at
some
point
soon
well
see
when
not
in
a
rush
but
i
dont
think
this
one
will
age
well
for
more
then
a
year
at
all
not
enough
body
to
keep
it
up
with
time
o
when
the
first
batch
of
this
beer
was
released
i
was
determined
to
avoid
it
as
most
people
i
trust
did
not
care
for
it
when
i
saw
that
a
second
batch
was
in
the
works
however
i
decided
to
give
it
a
shot
im
glad
i
did
because
this
is
an
extremely
unique
barleywine
at
first
i
didnt
think
the
flavors
worked
that
well
together
but
as
i
drank
more
they
really
came
together
nicely
before
you
write
this
one
off
i
would
recommending
giving
the
new
batch
a
try
you
might
be
pleasantly
surprised
highly
highly
disappointing
beer
wanted
to
try
it
since
i
hadnt
seen
this
one
on
the
shelves
in
pa
yet
the
sample
was
poured
at
the
ebf
night
session
the
beer
looked
good
with
a
nice
head
on
top
and
golden
colored
body
the
smell
wasnt
too
bad
it
smelled
sweet
and
appealing
the
taste
was
awful
to
me
i
dont
understand
why
or
how
but
it
was
terrible
i
had
a
friend
take
a
sip
also
and
they
agreed
with
me
i
didnt
even
finish
the
sample
of
this
one
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
but
nothing
too
special
overall
just
not
thrilled
with
this
beer
really
i
really
dont
know
what
happened
here
its
tough
to
grade
this
one
the
american
barleywine
is
a
tough
category
i
think
its
about
as
good
as
the
old
guardian
that
i
had
this
year
even
though
this
beer
is
much
different
opinion
this
is
a
decent
beer
if
you
want
something
like
a
barley
wine
with
training
wheels
the
overall
balance
is
unusually
balanced
toward
the
malt
in
the
end
though
i
think
that
it
ended
up
balanced
toward
the
hops
slightly
this
is
weird
for
this
style
i
do
enjoy
barley
wines
on
occasion
but
this
one
falls
short
of
what
i
would
put
in
this
category
most
good
barley
wines
are
practically
undrinkable
when
they
are
fresh
imo
and
need
a
couple
years
to
soften
up
i
dont
know
where
this
particular
example
would
go
in
a
couple
years
i
speculate
that
it
would
get
pretty
funky
as
there
are
hops
missing
to
hit
this
style
who
knows
maybe
it
would
age
like
an
old
ale
but
i
am
not
going
to
age
them
and
find
out
i
will
stick
to
more
consistent
beers
to
put
in
my
cellar
a
big
beer
for
sure
but
not
overwhelmingly
hot
or
pummeling
on
the
palate
not
a
bad
barleywine
but
could
use
a
kick
in
the
hops
o
very
good
i
like
the
oak
in
the
finish
on
this
one
i
havent
tasted
many
barleywines
so
i
went
out
and
bought
this
bottle
it
poured
a
half
inch
head
my
nose
registered
a
lot
of
complex
aromas
among
them
mango
bananas
pineapple
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
is
a
fruity
brew
the
palate
confirmed
my
suspicions
it
has
a
somewhat
bitter
after
taste
that
complement
its
fruity
fore
taste
i
like
it
i
will
pair
this
with
some
mild
cheese
and
drink
it
after
a
dinnerand
remember
folks
to
support
your
local
brewery
drink
beer
hog
md
the
sweetness
lends
a
particular
smoothness
but
the
high
abv
may
be
off
putting
to
some
and
definitely
reduce
its
sessionability
picked
up
a
bottle
since
i
like
barleywines
and
it
was
priced
decently
kind
of
a
mixed
up
mess
of
flavors
in
this
with
a
little
too
much
applepear
flavor
that
i
normally
only
taste
in
malt
liquors
maybe
ill
pick
up
another
bottle
for
cellaring
to
see
if
it
changes
over
time
overall
oversold
does
not
deliver
on
the
oak
promise
not
a
bad
barleywine
about
average
pours
a
two
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
ring
leaving
some
lace
crystal
clear
amber
color
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
grapefruit
and
caramel
nose
and
flavor
is
a
good
balance
of
caramel
and
grapefruit
not
much
oak
and
no
spicy
hotness
light
grapefruit
hops
at
finish
decent
barleywine
high
abv
is
hidden
7
00
for
a
22oz
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
overall
i
would
say
that
this
is
way
too
hot
to
be
overly
enjoyable
at
this
time
and
add
in
the
fact
that
i
dont
normally
tend
to
view
boozy
high
abv
brews
with
simple
base
pale
malts
maibocks
blonde
doppelbocks
etc
for
exampleas
overly
enjoyable
maybe
some
age
would
smooth
out
the
obvious
rough
edges
worth
a
try
i
guess
overall
this
was
almost
a
drainpour
the
toasted
element
sounded
nice
in
theory
but
what
a
tragedy
it
became
no
balance
and
any
complexity
it
may
have
had
was
lost
when
the
flavors
refused
to
work
together
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
thin
lacy
head
that
doesnt
last
very
long
the
nose
is
absolutely
full
of
booze
and
oak
kind
of
warming
but
a
little
uninviting
very
sweet
oak
and
booze
forward
taste
that
kind
of
meld
together
it
doesnt
linger
on
the
palate
too
long
but
theres
a
strange
aftertaste
that
i
cant
really
place
it
leaves
me
a
little
parched
and
complexed
overall
not
the
best
but
very
interesting
o
this
has
pretty
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
very
easy
for
being
11
5
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
barleywine
especially
considering
it
is
samuel
adams
the
only
thing
i
didnt
like
about
this
beer
was
the
little
bit
of
off
flavor
i
got
in
the
hop
profile
other
than
that
i
quite
enjoyed
it
it
is
worth
checking
out
bright
brassy
blonde
in
the
tulip
glass
with
a
fair
head
rich
and
tingly
sensation
on
the
tongue
sweet
but
not
syrupy
caramel
corn
with
butter
keeps
coming
to
mind
but
nicely
bittered
with
the
hops
which
provide
a
pleasant
long
tangy
hop
flavor
highly
sippable
and
adds
a
new
twist
to
the
barley
wine
style
nice
looking
deep
golden
body
thin
head
with
moderate
amounts
of
lace
left
behind
aroma
is
rich
with
malt
and
toasted
qualities
some
tropical
fruits
as
well
flavor
is
quite
smooth
and
very
easy
going
for
an
11
5
beer
rich
malts
lay
the
foundation
with
heavy
toasted
oak
notes
throught
fruitiness
is
evident
as
well
with
pineapple
and
tangerine
coming
to
mind
moderately
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
flavorful
reminded
me
of
behemoth
to
an
extent
but
with
a
good
dose
of
toasted
oak
added
to
the
mix
o
i
thought
this
beer
would
be
a
lot
better
but
it
was
not
as
good
as
the
third
voyage
this
is
beer
had
a
lot
of
hoppy
skunkiness
and
cheesiness
once
you
get
passed
the
hoppy
skunkiness
there
is
a
lot
of
tropical
citrus
vanilla
and
some
light
pineapple
subtleties
i
really
dont
know
what
is
going
on
with
this
beer
it
is
all
over
the
place
and
is
quite
hot
will
not
be
buying
this
again
not
sure
if
ill
finish
all
22oz
overall
i
was
interested
to
try
this
one
its
a
barleywine
which
i
tend
to
like
and
its
oak
flavored
which
i
also
think
is
a
great
combination
for
the
style
but
i
dont
know
what
they
were
aiming
at
as
far
as
a
blond
barleywine
but
it
has
citrus
indeed
dont
think
i
will
hunt
it
out
again
thats
just
me
you
should
give
it
a
shot
interesting
and
oddly
bold
for
samuel
adams
the
bottle
described
the
aroma
as
honeysuckle
which
i
would
agree
with
which
is
why
i
really
didnt
care
for
it
virtually
no
warming
which
is
shocking
for
11
5
abv
toffee
burnt
sugar
is
the
dominant
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
is
distracting
overall
it
has
a
unique
flavor
but
needs
some
tweaking
d
this
had
a
very
nice
scent
and
taste
with
an
interesting
blend
of
toasted
oak
and
tropical
fruits
the
body
was
a
little
bubbly
for
me
but
it
was
otherwise
nice
the
alcohol
was
noticeable
but
not
bad
so
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
this
may
improve
with
age
but
it
was
really
good
fresh
a
bourbon
barrell
version
would
be
excellent
it
looks
nice
but
smells
and
tastes
of
alcohol
it
sits
well
on
the
pallet
being
a
medium
body
beer
would
not
recommend
not
terribly
well
balanced
in
my
opinion
nothing
is
awful
about
this
but
its
a
little
too
sweet
and
the
oak
stands
out
a
little
too
much
nothing
substantially
wrong
with
this
one
just
a
lot
of
little
things
add
up
to
make
it
simply
an
ok
beer
overall
a
very
unique
brew
definitely
enjoyable
a
lot
of
toasted
oak
good
price
point
here
id
have
this
again
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
smooth
and
does
not
seem
nearly
as
big
as
the
abv
says
it
is
this
really
has
a
deceiving
mild
body
and
hides
the
burn
better
then
many
big
beers
overall
highly
recommend
an
11
5
can
be
intimidating
but
dont
let
it
fool
you
this
is
a
delicious
treat
and
was
perfect
for
a
christmas
eve
overall
drinkability
very
enjoyable
can
be
a
bit
too
solvent
at
times
but
this
is
a
barelywine
after
all
o
a
completely
unique
brew
how
sa
packed
this
level
of
complexity
in
a
goldenyellow
package
with
minimal
aroma
can
only
be
described
as
wizardry
tastewise
this
one
is
all
over
the
place
which
begs
the
question
is
it
any
good
i
would
say
a
resounding
yes
i
would
gladly
take
a
messy
unruly
uber
complex
beer
over
a
one
or
two
note
boring
one
any
day
i
can
tell
you
right
now
that
this
beer
is
not
going
to
be
for
everyone
in
fact
it
probably
wont
be
for
nearly
anyone
but
it
is
for
me
and
ill
be
snatching
up
every
bottle
i
find
and
i
encourage
beer
lovers
everywhere
to
sample
one
for
themselves
for
a
something
truly
different
ok
i
tried
a
second
mouthful
ugh
undrinkable
a
very
unpleasant
tasting
beer
very
mellow
perhaps
too
mellow
o
a
very
hoppy
american
barleywine
huge
tropical
fruit
notes
all
around
including
papaya
peach
pineapple
and
mango
big
carameltoffee
notes
still
keep
a
pretty
decent
balance
light
notes
of
oak
and
vanilla
round
out
the
complexity
nicely
an
excellent
offering
from
sa
and
definitely
needs
to
be
tried
a
light
yellow
amber
colored
brew
with
a
decent
head
of
frothy
white
with
a
blanketing
lacing
the
aroma
brings
light
vanilla
biscuit
with
some
skunk
cabbage
alcohol
not
crazy
about
it
and
definitely
not
your
typical
barleywine
the
flavor
says
thick
vanilla
biscuit
cabbage
with
wheat
and
cereal
grain
goodness
over
fermenting
dark
fruits
and
whiskey
this
takes
a
few
tastes
to
get
used
to
but
once
you
adjust
a
little
to
the
booziness
you
can
enjoy
this
mediumheavy
bodied
brew
with
its
lively
but
fine
carbonation
its
a
a
little
bit
higher
in
alcohol
than
i
typically
like
but
it
does
settle
into
a
slightly
buttery
oak
deal
that
satisfies
would
try
this
again
o
eh
drinkable
but
bordering
on
the
line
of
being
a
beer
i
would
dispise
scent
and
mouthfeel
are
off
putting
taste
its
decent
as
is
the
appearance
nothing
to
write
home
about
tempted
to
do
some
aging
but
i
just
not
sure
it
even
deserves
a
spot
in
my
tiny
little
cellar
idk
overall
this
is
ok
was
expecting
more
flavor
than
this
has
its
ok
but
not
going
to
buy
again

ok
nice

decent
very
unique
almost
an
english

backbone
with
both
american
and
english
hops
i
kind
of
liked
it
try
it
its
unique
overall
i
can
get
behind
it
its
not
bad
and
it
has
more
potential
than
may
be
being
offered
early
on
the
sites
i
feel
confident
in
watching
the
train
roll
in
and
out
with
this
one
and
see
where
i
goes
the
flavors
wit
the
sweetness
touch
of
booziness
fruity
aspect
brought
in
from
the
hops
kept
it
interesting
overall
a
bit
hot
but
at
11
5
its
really
to
be
expected
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
youll
be
seeing
not
only
griffins
but
manticores
chimeras
and
the
fearsome
jim
koch
cyclops
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
nemesis
2009
in
that
theres
plenty
of
good
there
but
really
needs
some
time
to
smooth
out
olike
a
malt
bomb
gone
bad
with
some
hops
thrown
in
the
balance
it
out
the
hops
were
not
balanced
alcohol
was
a
little
over
the
top
and
not
in
a
good
way
wws
comes
to
mind
for
a
good
way
not
sure
if
aging
would
help
this
baby
out
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
with
22oz
of
11
5
abv
just
make
sure
you
bring
a
designated
driver
or
share
with
friends
im
a
little
buzzed
by
the
end
of
this
review
in
fact
i
think
id
try
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
do
so
not
the
normal
beautiful
appearance
that
is
the
norm
for
sam
adams
beers
little
to
no
head
on
this
one
at
least
a
few
seconds
after
the
pour
orangeyamber
color
nose
is
boozy
with
some
wood
and
expired
fruit
palate
offers
more
wood
some
wood
and
then
more
wood
and
then
some
malt
and
funky
fruits
finish
is
woody
and
boozy
gold
body
and
a
decent
white
head
nice
fruit
smell
and
some
alcohol
taste
is
fruity
and
light
malt
kind
of
heavy
carbonation
i
am
not
sure
this
is
a
true
barleywine
i
think
of
barleywines
as
being
a
double
hit
of
hops
and
malt
i
just
am
not
feeling
the
malt
part
still
not
a
bad
offering
name
is
kind
of
lame
since
its
such
a
departure
from
what
they
usually
do
final
thought
7
a
pop
and
12
abv
and
some
crazy
ass
flavors
it
you
want
an
adventure
give
this
a
whirl
the
body
of
the
beer
was
clear
and
burnt
orange
in
color
which
was
a
few
shades
lighter
than
most
beers
of
the
style
carbonation
appeared
rapid
and
formed
a
two
finger
thick
head
in
the
tulip
glass
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
extremely
disappointing
i
was
expecting
a
hop
assault
like
bigfoot
or
old
guardian
but
instead
this
was
just
a
bit
of
honey
smell
and
very
mild
one
at
that
the
taste
revealed
this
beer
to
be
on
the
sweet
side
of
spectrum
i
could
detect
toffee
caramel
and
honey
there
just
werent
a
lot
of
hops
added
to
contribute
to
flavor
profile
there
was
peppery
bite
and
some
wood
notes
in
the
finish
the
body
appeared
a
bit
runny
and
did
not
have
the
richness
i
had
hoped
for
this
was
a
disappointment
for
an
oak
barrel
aged
barleywine
from
a
big
brewer
overall
im
not
happy
here
theres
no
coming
back
from
bad
flavor
wouldnt
get
this
again
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
again
if
youre
still
reading
put
this
one
away
for
a
bit
and
try
it
in
a
year
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
i
was
struck
by
the
difference
between
the
first
sip
and
the
flavor
profile
after
it
warmed
up
a
bit
at
fridge
temp
this
beer
doesnt
work
but
after
some
space
and
time
it
develops
a
pretty
unique
creamy
pineapple
flavor
i
would
love
to
age
some
of
this
stuff
and
see
what
it
does
its
very
hard
to
say
where
it
would
go
scents
of
pineapple
and
hoppy
resin
boast
a
sweet
treat
huge
barleywine
flavor
sweet
vinous
and
stonefruit
lychee
pineapple
beautiful
flavor
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
full
lovely
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
in
awhile
o
not
bad
but
just
above
average
for
the
style
poured
a
wonderfully
deep
blonde
with
copper
hints
with
wonderful
head
and
great
lacing
throughout
great
deep
malt
scent
with
excellent
pineapple
hop
undertones
deep
and
dark
great
flavors
with
a
wonderfully
deep
malt
flavor
nice
toffee
and
raisin
tastes
and
a
great
pineapple
and
citruslike
hop
finish
huge
oakiness
in
the
finish
as
well
way
more
than
i
typically
like
but
it
does
tell
me
up
front
to
expect
that
on
the
label
goes
down
very
well
for
such
a
high
abv
brew
with
with
an
objectively
derived
too
much
oakiness
which
slightly
hides
the
other
wonderful
flavors
overall
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
it
was
approximately
6
i
paid
for
this
and
i
feel
like
theres
a
lot
of
better
barleywine
beers
out
there
than
this
o
quite
pleasant
to
drink
with
such
a
high
abv
i
had
to
split
a
bomber
o
not
a
very
good
attempt
imo
at
a
fresh
bw
needs
some
hops
for
a
blondeamerican
bw
overall
while
the
nose
of
griffins
bow
promised
an
excellent
and
wellbalanced
brew
on
the
tongue
the
beer
didnt
live
up
to
the
promise
ending
up
simply
too
strong
in
alcohol
and
woodaged
flavors
and
tasted
more
like
an
extrasugary
liquor
shot
than
a
beer
so
strong
are
these
flavors
that
a
full
bottle
of
the
beer1
pt
6
fl
oz
is
going
to
be
a
little
overwhelming
for
this
reviewer
who
is
going
to
head
downstairs
immediately
and
look
for
a
bland
snack
such
as
unbuttered
popcorn
to
help
cleanse
the
palate
between
sips
giving
the
beer
a
little
credit
however
i
suspect
that
a
good
year
or
two
of
aging
will
help
temper
these
wild
flavors
greatly
and
will
likely
result
in
a
far
more
palatable
beverage
i
was
surprised
to
see
sam
adams
creating
concoctions
like
these
and
putting
them
on
sale
and
almost
as
surprised
how
well
this
worked
out
poured
a
good
looking
orangebronze
color
great
looking
beer
minimal
foam
no
lacing
light
film
with
a
ring
smell
is
fruit
alcohol
mostly
pineapple
taste
is
unbarleywine
like
very
fruit
forward
sweet
pineapple
malt
and
some
hops
maybe
a
little
alcohol
at
the
end
overall
unusual
not
my
favorite
but
interesting
to
try
an
ok
attempt
but
flavors
are
a
bit
much
if
not
even
to
all
over
the
place
pretty
good
to
try
once
but
hard
to
recommend
o
overall
this
may
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
sam
it
has
the
bitter
kick
and
hop
flavor
that
i
like
in
american
barley
wines
the
caramel
sweetness
and
balance
i
like
in
ipas
and
topped
off
with
oak
an
oak
finish
that
is
noticeable
but
not
overboard
this
is
one
fine
beer
pours
a
clear
apple
juice
color
with
a
2
inch
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
thin
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
off
the
bat
the
smell
is
pretty
suspect
with
some
weird
vegetal
and
rotten
pineapple
aromas
there
is
some
malt
and
brown
sugar
too
but
they
dont
do
anything
to
help
out
the
overall
smell
taste
is
exactly
like
the
smell
along
with
some
vanilla
and
oak
flavors
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
i
really
dont
care
for
this
barleywine
the
veggie
aroma
and
taste
pretty
much
kills
this
one
for
me
o
a
decent
beer
and
the
oak
aging
really
makes
it
better
rather
than
overpowering
anything
o
i
really
think
this
is
very
good
oak
and
booze
may
be
overbearing
to
some
but
i
personally
enjoy
it
looking
forward
to
aging
a
few
of
these
to
see
how
it
develops
this
beer
pours
a
light
to
medium
bodied
bright
copper
in
color
with
a
two
finger
very
creamy
off
white
head
the
aromas
are
kind
of
bland
you
get
some
soft
malts
cream
caramel
malts
slight
butter
and
a
light
hop
bitterness
the
flavors
are
again
soft
and
malty
you
get
smooth
maltyness
slight
butter
again
with
cream
and
ever
so
slight
hoppy
bitterness
it
doesnt
sound
spectacular
but
its
solid
its
just
really
really
smooth
and
has
a
great
mouthfeel
its
strange
for
a
barleywine
but
i
like
it
its
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
id
recommend
trying
it
it
doesnt
rate
well
but
youll
enjoy
drinking
it
hopefully
this
will
mellow
with
time
but
if
you
are
a
true
fan
of
complex
bwsa
then
i
would
steer
clear
o
being
a
barleywine
addict
this
one
simply
does
not
cut
it
as
in
wow
me
may
purchase
one
for
storing
but
as
of
right
now
this
beer
is
good
for
nothing
but
its
high
alcohol
content
on
the
pale
side
of
amber
nice
head
and
lacing
nice
floral
hoppiness
in
the
aroma
but
a
good
dose
of
malty
sweetness
as
well
sticky
caramel
flavor
with
enough
hop
bite
to
be
a
us
versioncomes
off
more
of
a
uk
in
the
long
run
strong
piney
flavor
lingering
harsh
bitterness
in
the
finsih
still
has
a
huge
underlying
malty
flavor
great
mouthfeelcaramel
and
toffee
not
a
trace
of
the
high
abv
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
need
to
get
another
bottle
to
age
a
bit
o
this
is
a
pretty
impressive
brew
from
sam
adams
i
have
been
underwhelmed
at
their
high
gravity
offerings
in
the
past
but
this
one
is
well
executed
it
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
all
things
considered
this
is
a
very
successful
brew
very
nice
sugary
sweet
candy
malt
type
aroma
your
classic
nicely
aged
barleywine
nice
notes
of
a
caramel
and
a
dulled
hoppy
flare
to
it
still
light
bready
malts
are
coming
through
nicely
now
as
well
the
flavor
was
very
rich
almost
a
syrup
like
feel
to
it
as
it
rolled
across
the
tonque
thick
with
a
nice
coating
feeling
to
it
the
flavor
was
very
sweet
lots
of
candy
flaored
malts
and
a
nice
and
thick
pine
resin
like
flavor
that
was
still
nicely
displayed
here
very
mellow
with
almost
no
alcohol
at
all
present
here
smooth
and
again
very
mellow
finis
o
overall
a
nice
interesting
beer
i
enjoyed
quite
a
bit
though
it
didnt
remind
me
of
a
barleywine
i
found
it
very
fruity
and
hoppy
and
there
was
a
ton
of
tropical
fruit
here
worth
checking
out
would
have
it
again
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
think
it
could
still
use
some
age
to
mellow
it
out
but
worth
checking
it
out
now
and
saving
another
for
sometime
in
the
distant
future
i
also
think
this
would
be
better
classified
as
an
english
bareleywine
or
an
english
something
definately
has
more
of
an
english
character
than
anything
american
poured
a
light
honey
amber
that
was
very
translucent
totally
filtered
had
an
off
white
lace
head
that
subsided
to
a
small
ring
around
the
glass
the
initial
smells
are
of
an
undiscernable
citrus
sour
slight
hop
and
even
slighter
malt
it
features
a
hoppy
pine
bitterness
with
clear
tastes
of
alcohol
it
is
not
syrupy
or
overly
boozy
for
a
high
abv
barleywine
like
the
others
ive
tried
from
this
series
tasman
red
third
voyage
its
definitely
worth
a
try
enjoy
o
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
but
its
really
kind
of
dissapointing
as
a
barleywine
if
they
called
it
a
iipa
i
would
have
scored
it
much
higher
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
so
hopped
up
that
nothing
else
shines
thru
maybe
a
year
or
3
in
the
cellar
will
help
this
one
pours
a
clear
deep
copper
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
shows
great
retention
and
a
huge
amount
of
lace
5
stars
for
appearance
smell
is
mostly
an
earthy
piney
aroma
that
i
think
is
zeus
hops
not
my
favorite
hop
slight
hints
of
candy
sugar
type
malt
sweetness
as
well
as
some
alcohol
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
again
with
that
candy
sweetness
mixed
with
a
sweet
fruitiness
that
reminds
me
of
tropical
fruits
the
earthy
piney
hop
flavor
is
in
there
as
well
as
a
touch
of
ethanol
medium
to
full
body
moderate
level
of
carbonation
with
a
sweet
fruity
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
i
kinda
liked
this
even
better
after
it
warmed
a
bit
its
well
made
beer
that
hardly
shows
its
11
5
abv
and
aside
from
my
dislike
of
the
hop
profile
id
love
to
see
how
this
ages
slightly
disappointing
as
most
of
the
characteristics
of
a
barleywine
are
lost
in
this
beer
a
clear
slow
sipper
here
perhaps
some
more
age
would
do
some
good
here
as
the
alcohol
is
pretty
forward
a
given
for
it
size
but
it
does
spill
all
over
the
palate
somewhat
of
a
mess
i
have
another
bottle
to
see
where
it
goes
would
love
to
know
the
story
behind
this
name
anyway
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
a
very
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
fake
banana
think
runts
all
the
way
here
folks
sweet
flowers
powdered
sugar
sweet
caramel
light
oak
vanilla
bean
and
light
sweetgrass
things
are
overtly
sweet
here
the
taste
holds
notes
of
sweet
flowers
light
caramel
strong
vanilla
bean
moldy
oak
and
a
bit
of
toasted
white
bread
man
the
toast
and
the
dank
wood
really
hang
around
for
a
while
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluffy
feel
overall
this
beer
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
the
oak
seems
to
be
primary
culprit
i
think
sending
everything
else
to
hell
with
it
yuck
o
a
pretty
good
beer
unique
and
reasonably
priced
doubt
id
pick
up
another
but
glad
i
got
one
this
is
a
monster
and
a
chore
to
finish
maybe
some
age
will
help
but
this
is
over
barring
right
now
not
something
i
would
recommend
poured
into
13
oz
tulip
glass
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
one
inch
white
head
that
settles
into
a
light
film
patches
of
lacing
smell
is
some
oak
garlic
and
fruity
esters
taste
wow
is
this
unique
similar
to
smell
but
way
more
aggressive
hints
of
vanilla
and
clove
really
a
perplexing
beer
i
dont
love
or
hate
it
makes
me
want
to
sip
again
so
i
can
make
sense
of
everything
body
is
fairly
light
and
enough
carbonation
for
the
style
o
a
very
interesting
barleywine
its
on
the
lighter
side
yet
has
enough
umph
behind
it
to
give
it
substance
although
its
extremely
complex
the
taste
throws
me
off
a
little
it
is
more
of
a
hybrid
style
though
overall
amazing
for
a
sam
adams
offering
after
the
mile
high
longshot
im
very
pleased
with
this
one
overall
pretty
good
beer
from
sam
adams
and
a
series
that
im
excited
for
ive
always
had
a
soft
spot
for
bbc
because
they
got
me
into
craft
beer
and
this
series
has
the
potential
to
bring
them
more
respect
in
the
more
extreme
styles
ill
definitely
be
trying
the
others
im
thoroughly
enjoying
this
and
id
have
to
say
its
the
lightest
looking
barleywine
ive
ever
seen
i
liked
this
one
at
first
but
it
quickly
became
apparent
that
the
heat
was
still
too
prevalent
with
this
i
picked
up
two
bottles
and
ill
lay
the
other
one
downfor
quite
a
while
to
see
how
this
ages
as
is
it
seems
like
sort
of
a
boozy
mess
to
me
i
wanted
to
like
this
one
too
omany
people
will
overlook
this
brew
as
it
has
a
sam
adams
logo
on
it
do
not
let
that
stop
you
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
and
deserves
a
great
grade
it
could
defiantly
use
some
cellar
time
as
i
find
the
hops
can
be
overpowering
a
little
but
perhaps
after
69
months
maybe
3
as
i
am
impatient
i
feel
this
can
mellow
out
and
shape
into
an
amazing
brew
good
thing
its
only
7
chiciago
as
i
will
purchase
more
before
theyre
gone
cheers
o
not
a
bad
barleywine
but
not
one
id
spend
too
much
time
looking
for
everything
was
okay
but
didnt
really
wow
me
definitely
a
step
in
the
right
direction
for
sam
adams
enjoyed
this
beer
pours
a
mostly
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
good
frothy
white
head
that
persists
for
a
good
time
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
behind
the
nose
brings
forward
very
light
oak
and
just
a
touch
of
grain
very
very
tame
without
really
anything
going
on
the
flavor
is
just
a
tad
bit
better
with
a
smidge
more
oak
and
a
faint
hop
presence
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
is
refreshing
no
noticeable
alcohol
which
was
impressive
just
blah
overall
it
had
potential
but
failed
to
follow
through
it
needs
more
malt
complexity
to
stand
up
to
the
hoppiness
and
butterscotchvanilla
notes
taken
from
the
toasted
oak
overall
pretty
impressed
nice
malts
lots
of
nice
hop
flavors
tons
of
buttery
oak
add
an
interesting
touch
very
complex
and
drinkable
i
think
its
safe
to
say
this
is
well
worth
a
pick
up
at
6
99
especially
if
you
dont
mind
a
lot
of
booziness
time
will
do
good
things
to
griffins
bow
mellowing
out
its
hotness
od
interesting
and
unique
enjoying
the
warming
effects
of
this
immensely
good
price
point
the
complexity
of
this
makes
it
a
sipper
moreso
than
the
alcohol
presence
happy
to
stumble
upon
it
very
impressed
with
this
new
small
batch
beer
from
samuel
adams
an
interesting
drink
to
say
the
least
prost
fruende
the
initial
smell
that
sways
my
sinuses
is
one
of
raisin
and
a
bit
of
toast
a
few
more
inhales
and
i
also
notice
a
little
bit
of
citrus
i
suspect
from
the
willamette
hops
its
color
appears
as
a
deep
and
slightly
cloudy
mahogany
backlit
by
the
sun
it
gives
off
a
small
red
flare
midst
the
brown
my
first
sip
includes
roasted
malt
a
tinge
of
hops
and
more
raisins
from
the
nose
midway
through
i
also
detect
vanilla
and
a
little
bourbon
it
lingers
joined
by
big
wood
rim
shot
no
really
the
finish
really
leaves
you
with
the
oakaged
portion
of
the
process
great
sipper
tiny
bubbles
and
mistdroplet
like
lacing
ive
had
the
regular
version
of
this
i
much
prefer
this
one
as
it
reminds
me
of
widdershins
but
with
less
oak
good
take
on
barleywine
without
being
from
across
the
pond
o
meal
in
a
glass
definitely
a
sipper
could
have
used
a
touch
more
carbonationhop
balance
but
based
on
the
age
i
can
understand
that
the
hops
and
carbo
is
lost
good
to
finally
try
a
2
yr
barleywine
they
wont
last
that
long
in
my
house
great
coloralbeit
a
bit
cloudy
and
a
nice
fine
head
that
like
to
stick
around
for
a
while
the
nose
is
almost
barleywine
all
the
way
with
a
hint
of
oak
playing
a
supporting
role
deep
down
under
the
figs
berries
nuts
light
caramel
showing
as
a
touch
of
vanilla
bringing
up
the
rear
not
too
much
here
in
the
way
of
hops
or
specialty
malts
but
thats
how
i
prefer
them
anyway
the
vanilla
comes
out
a
lot
more
on
the
palate
while
the
oak
lingers
in
the
finish
a
very
wellintegrated
and
nonintrusive
element
the
elegant
presentation
of
wellwoven
flavors
unfortunately
is
marred
by
an
underattenuated
quality
that
dominates
all
else
dry
this
out
a
touch
and
it
would
do
a
lot
for
this
beer
solid
effort
but
it
easily
could
have
been
on
a
whole
other
level
this
cant
have
spent
too
much
time
on
wood
as
the
oak
properties
are
way
behind
the
malt
and
the
carbonation
on
this
is
still
so
robust
the
color
is
a
hazy
dark
amber
and
its
real
heady
for
an
oaked
brew
the
nose
is
slightly
fruity
almost
dried
cherries
or
figs
on
it
with
all
the
grain
taking
on
a
sweeter
molasses
sort
of
complexion
with
just
a
faint
staleness
the
flavor
is
rather
uniform
with
a
real
fruity
finish
and
an
impressively
light
body
for
both
the
alcohol
content
and
the
norms
of
the
style
dark
caramel
sweetness
from
the
grain
it
tastes
like
unfermented
wort
but
the
finish
is
much
more
resolved
dryer
and
honestly
rather
clean
for
the
start
cherry
and
maybe
raisin
fruit
flavors
as
well
tons
of
bubbles
on
it
a
well
hidden
abv
and
a
dangerously
drinkable
lighter
body
i
could
stand
to
see
a
little
more
of
a
prominent
oak
profile
on
it
may
mellow
the
grain
sweetness
but
i
think
the
beer
is
solid
as
a
more
drinkable
barleywine
not
southern
tiers
best
but
a
beer
not
to
pass
up
if
you
havent
had
one
overall
better
then
expected
with
the
sweetness
thatbi
love
but
still
needing
to
age
a
little
more
for
my
taste
would
like
to
pick
up
a
bottle
o
a
nice
approachable
example
of
an
american
barleywine
that
displays
just
enough
depth
and
complexity
to
remain
intriguing
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
for
ale
drinkers
wanting
to
try
something
a
bit
stronger
and
heavier
o
id
go
for
this
again
a
very
nice
barley
wine
to
sip
on
ive
probably
over
scored
a
few
barley
wines
in
the
past
compared
to
this
one
because
its
definitely
right
up
there
overall
this
more
than
lived
up
to
expectations
i
went
out
specifically
for
the
tapping
of
this
keg
and
im
happy
i
did
i
will
most
defnitely
be
seeking
this
out
in
the
futurewould
love
to
try
it
from
a
bottle
as
well
bottled
feb
2012
23
months
old
glad
i
got
to
try
this
as
i
think
its
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
had
overall
the
shop
employee
recommended
this
not
sure
how
old
it
is
but
he
said
it
had
some
age
on
it
and
it
was
drinking
well
well
he
wasnt
lying
this
is
great
more
like
an
english
barley
wine
as
the
hops
have
matured
past
in
your
face
bitterness
overall
quite
an
enjoyable
barleywine
one
of
the
more
balanced
ive
tasted
quite
drinkable
despite
the
abv
usually
i
like
to
cellar
a
barlywine
for
a
good
year
but
this
was
able
to
be
enjoyed
right
away
i
suspect
the
oak
has
tamed
some
of
the
over
the
top
hops
and
sweetness
that
barleywines
usually
display
o
big
caramel
malt
flavor
with
a
nice
citrusy
flavor
to
compliment
a
bit
of
age
has
been
nice
to
this
beer
very
good
this
is
good
really
good
i
kinda
knew
i
was
gonna
love
this
before
even
cracking
it
open
and
i
did
oh
yes
i
did
bottle
to
snifter
at
world
of
beer
tioga
pours
a
reddish
brown
clear
with
nearly
no
head
aroma
of
sweet
hard
candies
bit
of
dank
hops
but
heavy
on
the
caramel
malt
flavor
is
toffee
biscuit
hard
candy
dry
oak
vanilla
root
beer
plenty
going
on
but
super
sweet
i
sould
have
shared
this
with
someone
but
it
was
only
my
wife
and
i
at
the
bar
and
she
wont
drink
it
slick
mouthfeel
with
lowish
carbonation
not
bad
but
just
a
bit
much
for
me
on
the
sweet
side
and
a
bit
more
oak
than
i
would
have
wanted
o
this
is
a
damn
nice
barley
wine
and
the
year
i
let
it
age
has
done
some
nice
things
to
mellow
it
out
a
bit
o
very
good
beer
cant
wait
to
have
again
its
a
great
option
for
an
american
style
barley
wine
overall
like
the
oak
aged
pumking
the
oak
really
does
round
out
the
hops
and
malts
making
some
flavors
stronger
and
some
secondary
flavors
come
to
life
truly
a
world
class
barleywine
overall
not
too
bad
approachable
for
those
starting
their
forray
into
barleywines
not
overly
complex
the
oak
smooths
the
beer
out
and
adds
a
nice
secondary
flavor
profile
affordable
8
99
easydrinking
and
tasty
but
not
the
greatest
o
a
solid
beer
but
not
a
showstopper
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
and
it
gained
some
complexity
as
it
warmed
up
from
the
46f
pour
temp
theres
just
a
standout
element
missing
that
places
it
behind
other
barlywinestyled
brews
ive
drunk
o
im
very
glad
i
found
one
of
these
but
i
wish
i
had
more
great
beer
with
some
age
on
it
o
a
sure
winter
sipper
of
a
beer
its
very
nicely
balanced
and
the
oak
is
well
integrated
alcohol
is
very
tame
even
at
the
9
6
a
solid
buy
when
its
available
o
finally
a
good
beer
in
the
past
few
days
it
might
just
have
been
that
i
needed
a
break
from
stouts
this
seems
like
a
light
barleywine
but
i
dont
mean
that
in
a
bad
way
it
is
a
full
and
flavorful
bw
that
is
easy
to
drink
o
excellent
american
barley
wine
one
of
the
best
ive
had
id
drink
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
o
this
seems
to
strike
a
middle
ground
between
the
hoppy
american
barleywine
and
the
sweet
desserty
english
barleywine
and
truth
be
told
im
more
reminded
of
the
latter
here
oddly
for
the
style
this
is
best
when
its
very
cold
it
becomes
rather
imbalanced
and
even
harsh
when
warmed
up
sufficiently
chestnut
brown
in
color
with
a
reddish
hue
and
a
slight
haze
poured
with
a
short
beige
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
sweet
caramel
malt
prune
and
ripe
apple
aromas
with
spicy
herbal
and
citrus
hop
aromas
in
the
background
vanilla
aromas
surface
and
intensify
as
this
warms
full
bodied
chewy
feel
with
lazy
rich
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
spicy
tanginess
vanilla
ripe
fruit
apple
and
prune
flavors
throughout
bready
and

flavors
up

tangy
peppery
herbal

through
the
middle
that
transition
to
citrusy
bitter

at
the
end
finishes
with
a
sticky
sweet
maltiness
on
the
edges
with
a
delayed
hop
bitterness
down
the
middle
incredibly
malty
yet
a
plethora
of
flavors
and
hop
character
d
could
be
the
oakiest
beer
ive
ever
had
and
its
dope
when
you
think
of
it
as
a
whiskey
although
it
has
a
distinct
freshness
to
it
also
the
sheer
amount
of
tannins
has
my
pilot
light
flickering
a
little
more
sweetness
in
the
flavor
would
be
appreciated
but
its
a
beast
as
it
is
this
is
a
cigar
beer
if
ive
ever
had
one
something
dark
to
compliment
the
spiciness
pours
a
rich
amber
tinged
deep
brown
with
a
billowing
one
and
a
half
finger
off
white
creamy
head
that
takes
forever
to
settlejust
great
clarity
and
a
great
head
toasty
oak
and
alcohol
soaked
dark
fruit
in
the
noseas
it
warms
a
real
alcohol
zip
comes
into
play
a
full
creamy
feel
with
low
carbonation
flavors
are
lightly
toasted
with
a
shot
of
vanilla
and
raisinits
not
overly
sweet
though
as
there
is
a
earthy
more
toasted
finish
i
like
this
better
than
the
standard
versionit
doesnt
seem
to
be
as
sweetthe
oak
is
not
overbearing
another
great
one
from
st
final
thoughts
id
been
curious
to
try
backburner
for
a
while
now
well
ever
since
i
grew
to
appreciate
this
style
and
while
not
the
beer
i
expected
it
did
impress
just
when
id
begun
to
peg
the
american
barleywine
style
as
nothing
more
than
citrusy
maltbombs
backburner
comes
along
and
redefines
that
trend
with
characteristics
of
both
an
american
barleywine
english
barleywine
and
scotch
ale
backburner
is
a
treat
for
those
seek
out
the
finer
things
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
o
i
hate
to
say
it
but
im
not
a
fan
of
this
one
i
like
that
the
oak
cuts
the
sweetness
but
its
just
too
understated
for
the
brigade
of
sweetness
that
attacks
the
palate
its
like
drinking
overly
sweetened
tea
well
put
together
and
easy
drinking
gives
this
a
bump
in
points
i
read
reviews
about
a
strong
hop
profile
so
i
really
want
to
try
a
fresh
version
overall
i
have
had
this
before
younger
and
it
was
very
good
picked
up
a
15
month
old
bottle
to
try
still
a
solid
barley
wine
i
have
never
had
the
unoaked
version
so
i
dont
how
it
compares
but
the
oak
helps
this
out
a
lot
i
see
they
dry
hop
with
amirillo
and
centennial
so
id
be
interested
in
finding
a
fresh
bottle
some
day
if
you
like
barelywine
this
is
worth
a
try
22
ounce
bottle
into
snifter
bottled
on
2152012
pours
slightly
hazy
deep
ruby
red
color
with
a
1
finger
dense
cream
colored
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
lace
cap
that
lingers
light
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
on
the
glass
aromas
of
big
orange
zest
caramel
raisin
molasses
toast
toffee
oak
floral
pine

fantastic

toast
brown

floral
light
pine
and

earthiness
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
damn
nice
complexity
and
balance
of
deep
malt
flavors
with
moderate
hop
balance
and
zero
cloying
sweetness
present
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
moderately
full
bodied
with
a
creamy
fairly
slick
and
lightly
sticky
mouthfeel
that
is
very
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
hardly
any
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
highly
excellent
barleywine
all
around
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
malt
flavors
with
moderate
hops
and
dangerously
smooth
to
sip
on
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
poured
from

into
snifter

and
mallet
rochester
ny
pours
a
hazy
burnt
orange
with
nice
lacing
sweet
malty
syrup
and
an
almost
citrus
hop
aroma
taste
is
somewhat
mild
toffe
at
first
but
finishes
with
a
big
toffee
caramel
hop
flavor
with
a
mild
vanilla
woody
oak
its
easy
to
drink
really
easy
but
hits
hard
its
better
as
it
warms
nice
barleywine
o
a
well
crafted
american
barley
wine
hits
the
mark
with
a
nice
hop
bill
that
balances
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
it
is
what
you
would
expect
the
kicker
though
is
you
are
not
getting
much
of
the
oak
in
the
flavor
perhaps
the
oak
is
working
in
the
background
to
balance
out
the
often
assertive
flavors
in
the
style
would
like
to
see
how
this
one
works
out
with
age
and
will
definitely
consider
getting
more
if
it
is
available
o
this
is
actually
pretty
nice
the
oak
tempers
the
sweetness
a
bit
and
the
hop
character
isnt
astringent
or
overbearing
appears
a
deep
brown
with
brilliant
red
highlights
nice
thick
offwhite
head
decent
retention
and
lacing
rich
boozy
aroma
spicy
herbal
wood
earthy
hops
complex
taste
has
a
good
balance
of
caramel
malt
bitter
hops
and
slight
alcohol
burn
a
bit
syrupy
coats
the
tongue
mild
carbonation
which
works
nice
beers
to
slowly
sip
and
enjoy
opens
up
and
is
quite
nice
as
it
warms
o
a
fairly
sweet
beer
thats
got
a
good
amount
of
hops
bitterness
with
a
moderate
amount
of
oak
character
i
didnt
get
much
in
the
way
of
an
other
barrel
character
like
like
it
was
a
wine
or
whiskey
barrel
that
it
was
aged
in
and
overall
id
like
a
bit
more
oak
character
in
there
id
had
this
fresh
before
like
out
bright
tank
13
day
after
brewing
fresh
along
with
from
the
store
where
its
had
a
solid
amount
of
hops
flavor
and
aroma
which
is
awesome
if
not
a
bit
agressive
aged
this
beer
has
mellowed
but
i
dont
see
it
become
an
elegant
after
dinner
beer
like
other
barleywine
personally
i
prefer
this
one
young
and
full
of
hops
character
but
this
still
help
ease
the
pain
of
a
long
work
week
just
fine
overall
very
good
overall
this
was
solid
beer
but
with
some
many
other
barleywines
out
there
that
i
like
better
i
probably
wont
buy
it
anytime
soon
again
o
obviously
the
answer
is
it
depends
on
the
temperature
poured
into
a
lost
abbey
tulip
bottled
21512
pours
a
orange
red
with
a
one
inch
off
white
head
that
leaves
some
solid
lace
smell
is
hard
candy
vanilla
dark
fruit
biscuit
carmel
grapefruit
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
really
well
balanced
lots
of
vanilla
carmel
burnt
brown
sugar
and
sweet
grapefruit
in
the
finish
body
is
thinner
than
expected
the
amount
of
carbonation
you
would
expect
not
really
dry
and
drinkable
for
its
heft
this
is
a
good
and
different
tasting
barleywine
o
its
a
pretty
nice
all
around
bw
really
enjoy
the
oak
aged
aspects
along
with
the
big
vanilla
like
bws
it
has
the
complexity
to
make
this
one
intriguing
and
enjoyable
solid
o
i
am
a
big
southern
tier
fan
they
just
do
it
right
i
am
a
big
barley
wine
fan
this
is
a
beer
that
meets
the
style
and
lives
up
to
the
southern
tier
level
of
quality
and
uniqueness
my
sister
picked
this
up
for
me
at
the
brewery
beautiful
clear
mahogany
pour
with
two
finger
offwhite
head
with
decent
retention
and
great
lacing
huge
sweet
oaky
nose
with
hints
of
caramel
butterscotch
candy
booze
vanilla
and
toffee
the
taste
is
complex
and
the
oak
is
once
again
the
star
nicely
complemented
with
hints
of
caramel
butter
brown
sugar
vanilla
dark
fruit
specifically
figs
toffee
and
just
a
touch
of
orange
zest
licorice
and
coconut
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
syrupy
but
surprisingly
smooth
with
a
subtle
bitterness
and
alcohol
warming
on
the
finish
with
that
said
its
really
pretty
drinkable
for
a
9
6
abv
beer
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
earlier
this
year
and
its
even
smoother
and
more
drinkable
than
the
bottle
version
probably
my
favorite
barley
wine
o
nothing
really
jumps
out
to
me
in
this
beer
but
overall
its
solid
have
had
better
barleywines
for
sure
but
this
is
a
worth
a
try
overall
pretty
good
glad
to
have
tried
it
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
citrus
zest
and
alcohol
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
medium
citrus
zest
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
but
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
really
doesnt
come
across
as
oakaged
in
the
aroma
or
flavor
overall
by
far
the
best
thing
about
this
brew
was
the
nose
this
is
the
closest
nose
weve
found
to
be
nearly
as
oaky
and
smooth
as
the
bourbon
county
series
the
rest
of
the
tasting
falls
from
there
drastically
the
flavoring
is
hugely
boozy
throughout
with
fusel
fire
burning
away
the
rest
of
the
palate
and
decimating
all
flavor
the
feel
was
also
thinner
than
expected
again
taking
away
from
the
experience
this
beer
is
either
way
too
young
or
just
doesnt
work
very
raw
and
powerful
flavors
all
around
nothing
seemed
to
mesh
well
id
like
to
try
a
bottled
version
with
some
time
on
it
nice
bw
falls
into
its
style
o
this
is
a
solid
barley
wine
its
very
hop
forward
which
leaves
me
to
think
that
this
was
only
aged
for
a
few
months
on
oak
chips
if
it
was
aged
for
a
longer
period
of
time
the
hop
flavor
would
have
completely
disappeared
and
i
think
the
oak
would
have
been
more
present
but
a
great
beer
and
for
7
it
is
a
steal
o
this
beer
is
a
bit
dry
and
most
of
the
flavors
are
very
soft
but
the
big
pungent
hops
seem
to
dominate
everything
the
raw
oak
notes
do
add
a
nice
character
to
the
beer
pours
a
clean
orangeish
to
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
mellow
bourbon
small
dark
fruits
and
alcohol
in
the
taste
alcohol
to
oaky
bourbon
dark
fruit
and
licorice
an
alcohol
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
bourbon
vanilla
and
alcohol
like
aftertaste
too
big
like
a
shot
inside
a
barleywine
its
just
too
much
for
me
o
ive
never
had
regular
backburner
so
i
cant
say
if
this
is
better
or
worse
but
i
can
tell
where
the
oak
really
shines
through
and
helps
this
beer
o
i
will
drink
this
again
and
again
my
biggest
inital
complaint
with
non
ba
version
is
that
it
super
bitter
like
bigfoot
which
i
can
not
stand
the
oak
really
rounds
out
the
beer
and
makes
it
very
plesant
and
enjoyable
o
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
that
ive
tried
robustly
hopped
and
so
smooth
with
the
nice
blended
flavors
of
oak
excellent
and
highly
recommended
o
silky
smooth
sweet
bitter
citrusy
with
enough
notes
to
keep
even
the
best
playing
awesome
blend
of
caramel
sweetness
bitter
citruspine
licorice
and
buttered
popcorn
nice
mouthfeel
nice
stickiness
this
one
really
benefits
from
the
aging
in
my
opinion
the
original
was
dominated
by
a
persistant
presence
of
the
yeast
that
was
used
while
this
was
much
more
balanced
by
the
oak
fruit
and
caramel
flavors
overall
a
fantastic
barley
wine
made
better
with
some
oak
additions
a
must
for
anyone
who
likes
barley
wines
or
for
those
who
dont
think
they
like
the
style
oive
had
the
regular
back
burner
but
never
reviewed
it
should
seek
it
out
for
comparison
the
flavor
is
good
too
more
earthiness
more
cloying
caramellike
sweetness
but
overall
nice
fruit
notes
creep
in
after
a
few
quaffs
i
feel
like
the
oak
doesnt
shine
as
much
in
the
flavor
i
think
my
tolerance
for
alcohol
flavor
is
strengthening
because
this
one
doesnt
seem
to
bad
at
least
i
a
not
getting
any
annoying
alcoholic
notes
like
others
have
had
ive
always
been
a
big
fan
of
backburner
needless
to
say
an
oak
aged
version
was
very
intriguing
to
me
it
definitely
delivers
but
it
isnt
quite
as
good
as
backburner
i
think
the
oak
flavor
tends
to
mask
some
of
its
dark
fruit
and
hop
flavor
its
still
very
good
though
definitely
a
worthy
endeavor
check
it
out
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
chewy
sweet
and
hot
d
very
nice
offering
here
from
southern
tier
i
wasnt
even
aware
i
had
purchased
the
oak
aged
version
until
i
took
my
first
sip
lots
of
good
things
going
on
here
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
young
a
little
time
in
the
bottle
could
round
this
one
into
elite
barleywine
contention
nice
not
must
have
o
good
barleywine
but
not
very
complex
wish
this
beer
picked
up
some
more
flavors
from
the
oak
adds
a
bit
of
complexity
on
top
of
the
base
beer
which
was
lacking
a
bit
in
that
department
doesnt
quite
become
a
complex
savory
monster
as
many
oakbarrelbourbon
aged
barleywines
are
able
to
its
better
than
the
original
but
not
worth
seeking
out
extensively
this
oaked
version
of
backburner
remains
well
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
for
a
perfect
after
dinner
substitute
to
port
wines
or
sherries
the
complexity
of
oak
gives
an
overall
woodish
taste
and
powdery
texture
but
also
amplify
the
caramel
vanillans
and
char
while
rounding
off
the
rougher
edges
of
grassy
and
sharp
citrusy
hops
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
alcohol
is
definitely
evident
i
expected
a
little
more
hop
presence
for
the
style
all
in
all
a
pleasure
to
slowly
swill
but
although
it
is
well
crafted
very
complex
its
perhaps
too
much
so
for
my
liking
in
the
barley
wine
style
o
very
much
like
the
base
beer
only
with
added
notes
of
vanilla
and
oak
i
like
the
complexity
of
this
even
though
its
difficult
to
get
past
the
sweetness
in
some
cases
the
oak
and
vanilla
come
out
more
and
more
as
this
warms
up
so
its
good
to
let
this
sit
for
about
20
minutes
before
it
really
shines
and
becomes
a
different
beer
than
the
regular
o
not
my
favorite
barleywine
but
drinkable
nonetheless
ive
been
in
love
with
the
backburner
and
when
the
base
beer
is
as
good
as
it
is
i
believe
you
shouldnt
mess
with
it
however
theres
exceptions
to
that
just
looka
at
what
founders
does
with
variations
of
breakfast
stout
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
mahogany
brown
hue
with
a
cream
colored
khaki
head
with
fine
speckled
laicng
forming
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
has
oak
and
vanilla
with
hints
of
booze
caramelized
sugars
with
a
rolling
breadiness
also
in
addition
theres
a
subdued
earth
citrus
pith
and
herbaceous
flavor
combination
that
gets
a
bit
jaded
by
the
loads
of
vanilla
and
charred
oak
flavors
making
the
beer
a
bit
dysmal
for
me
i
like
unearthly
but
not
a
fan
of
oak
aged
unearthly
this
is
basically
the
same
type
of
oak
flavor
it
just
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
that
the
base
beer
meant
so
much
mouthfeel
burns
a
bit
a
quite
booze
ridden
with
dry
oak
chip
finish
going
on
cloyingly
sweet
at
the
same
time
not
enough
hops
balance
things
out
overall
i
dont
like
the
booze
level
and
the
overt
sweetness
found
in
this
beer
picked
up
just
because
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
after
being
forces
to
bowl
i
hate
bowling
this
beer
has
an
awesome
color
deep
transparent
garnett
red
it
glows
some
puffy
head
a
little
bit
of
lacing
actually
more
like
speckling
aroma
has
some
pine
pith
rich
malty
toffee
and
caramel
notes
and
oak
essence
did
i
just
right
oak
essence
well
oak
its
there
actually
it
kind
of
takes
away
from
the
rest
of
the
aroma
some
good
things
balanced
hops
citrus
pith
pine
rich
caramel
like
malt
syrupy
sappy
some
bad
things
the
oak
wood
flavor
is
a
bit
artificial
and
wood
chip
e
tasting
aside
from
that
i
really
enjoy
the
balance
of
this
beer
some
a
barleywines
are
just
too
hoppy
bitter
and
this
is
nice
a
rich
full
and
slightly
slick
mouthfeel
its
good
it
isnt
hot
and
the
alcohol
hides
well
i
think
this
beer
wwould
be
great
in
6
months
perhaps
the
wood
would
relax
at
that
point
o
a
good
beer
overall
i
really
like
the
peach
aromas
though
im
not
for
sure
if
theyre
intended
or
not
still
its
not
cloyingly
sweet
like
many
southern

beers
overalla
great

i
have
been
drinking
a

barleywines

bottle
from
trade
thanks
dude
pours
dark
reddish
amber
with
a
small
yellowish
khaki
head
aroma
of
hard
candies
like
the
kind
on
the
outside
of
candy
apples
brown
sugar
toffee
biscuits
a
small
bit
of
vanilla
oak
and
some
whiskey
flavor
is
very
similar
to
the
regular
version
up
front
hard
candy
toffee
biscuity
sweetness
but
the
finish
provides
something
new
notes
of
vanilla
oak
and
bourbon
the
difference
from
the
regular
is
rather
subtle
and
maybe
thats
because
this
has
been
in
the
bottle
for
2
years
or
so
slick
and
thickish
bodied
low
carbonation
but
not
quite
syrupy
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
i
must
say
i
am
a
bit
disappointed
at
the
lack
of
barrel
influence
here
i
was
expecting
a
big
oaky
vanilla
infusion
here
that
i
didnt
really
get
o
numbskull
is
great
to
start
out
with
the
barrel
aging
makes
it
even
better
well
balanced
malt
and
sweetness
forward
with
some
smooth
finish
this
is
truly
outstanding
mouthfeeloverall
under
medium
bodied
with
pretty
high
carbonation
okay
mouthfeel
probably
a
little
thin
for
my
tastes
overall
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
this
ba
version
of
numbskull
as
i
mentioned
before
i
could
not
shake
the
impression
of
buttery
flavor
and
that
pretty
much
sealed
this
beers
fate
for
me
definitely
would
not
be
opposed
to
trying
this
again
at
some
point
to
give
it
another
shot
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
beer
but
the
taste
is
a
bit
harsh
right
now
keeping
it
from
being
great
id
guess
is
a
few
years
this
will
be
outstanding
the
nose
is
great
and
there
is
a
ton
of
bourbon
and
caramel
throughout
would
like
to
get
another
bottle
and
revisit
in
a
year
this
beer
was
pretty
good
no
doubt
but
i
dont
exactly
think
it
lives
up
to
the
acclaim
it
has
been
given
perhaps
i
should
have
let
the
bottle
mellow
out
a
bit
more
as
is
its
a
bit
too
in
your
face
with
the
bourbon
and
heat
to
thoroughly
enjoy
more
than
a
four
ounce
sample
its
delicious
in
extremely
small
doses
the
flavors
are
excellent
and
work
well
together
but
it
becomes
clamoring
and
cumbersome
in
larger
ones
due
to
its
heat
id
like
to
have
this
again
with
more
age
and
see
how
it
fares
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
strong
character
at
the
moment
the
bourbon
is
a
bit
harsh
but
it
will
smooth
out
over
time
for
sure
very
complex
and
delicious
beer
the
barrels
really
works
nicely
for
this
beer
but
all
the
malt
and
hop
flavors
just
shine
richly
o
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
ba
barleywine
but
it
was
still
too
hoppy
for
my
taste
the
hops
and
bitterness
throw
it
off
a
bit
alesmith
knows
their
way
around
a
barrel
this
is
no
exception
id
be
delighted
if
they
stepped
up
the
frequency
volume
of
their
releases
a
standard
for
the
fairly
rare
style
of
barrelaged

an
alcohol
kick
on
the

there
is
a
mild
amount

on
the

with

this
beer
has
a
good
level

this
is
a
very
good

with
a
great
aroma
and
some
tasty

overall
perhaps
a

past
its
prime
but
still
a
fantastic
beer
the
smell
was
amazing
and
with

this

would
have
been
even
better

i
had
the

with
some

with

not
as
much
as
expected
light

notes
a
re

that
this
bottle
might
be
past
its
prime
bourbon
notes
are
not

dominant
as
i
would
have
expected
body
is
a
little
bit
thin
for
style
with
medium
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
notes
fell
a
bit
short
of
my
expectation
but
good
nonetheless
it
would
be
interesting
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
next
time
overall
this
was
super
even
though
i
think
it
is
slightly
past
its
prime
the
oxidated
notes
and
low
carbonation
hurt
the
overall
experience
but
its
a
deal
breaker
for
this
style
i
would
say
consume
this
within
5
years
for
maximum
enjoyment
so
it
is
still
worth
it
to
seek
out
the
2007
release
but
get
it
soon
the
beer
is
hazy
and
appears
brown

color
the
head
is
off
white
and
thin
the
aroma
is
bold

offers

very
enticing
the
flavor
really
delivers
a
delightful
beer
to
sip
and
savor
medium

full

very
malt
forward
and
well
balanced
a
gem
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer

excellent
brew
that
i
had
wanted
to
try
for
some
time
thanks
again
jr
bravo
and
this
is
also
my
500th
review
on
ba
this
is
the
best
ba
barleywine
that
ive
had
to
date
and
i
wish
i
that
i
had
more
bottles
overall
id
wanted
to
try
this
beer
for
a
good
while
and
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
yet
another
outstanding
barrelaged
beer
from
alesmith
and
one
thats
well
worth
a
shot
really
nice
and
interesting
bal
aged
beer
great
to
finally
tick
this
one
alesmith
once
again
does
not
disappoint
chad
drinkability
i
liked
this
one
a
little
bit
less
than
the
nonbal
version
truth
be
told
it
just
lacked
a
lot
of
the
complexity
and
had
a
lot
more
unwanted
spiciness
and
aggressiveness
maybe
this
one
would
hold
its
own
against
the
aforementioned
when
they
were
both
aged
differently
the
aged
old
numbskull
i
had
was
an
07
as
well
but
nonetheless
this
ones
simply
lacking
in
a
few
places
with
the
bourbon
or
the
aging
covering
up
a
few
of
the
really
nice
notes
that
i
got
out
of
the
nonbal
version
dont
get
me
wrong
the
bal
version
is
splendid
with
the
vanilla
and
coconut
overtones
amplifying
some
wonderful
elements
of
this
brew
but
it
definitely
leaves
a
few
of
the
highlights
untouched
dthis
seems
to
have
some
malt
issues
going
on
tons
of
burnt
sugars
in
the
flavor
and
a
little
too
much
alcohol
the
flavors
dont
work
super
well
together
the
barrel
aging
is
rather
pleasant
with
the
flavors
it
has
added
but
it
did
thin
out
a
little
while
in
those
barrels
i
liked
this
more
than
the
ba
wee
heavy
but
less
than
ba
decadence
and
ba
speedway
full
creamy
body
a
bit
over
carbonated
but
still
quite
nice
good
beer
but
would
be
better
if
aged
in
a
wine
barrel
the
flavor
is
an
oddly
sourfruity
combination
but
not
in
a
bad
way
lots
of
caramel
and
toasty
maltiness
very
boozy
the
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
appropriately
low
like
most
of
the
barrel
aged
alesmith
releases
i
found
this
one
to
be
solid
though
very
unspectacular
the
palate
is
beautifully
integrated
with
flavors
of
caramel
toffee
dried
fruits
and
nuts
with
dates
being
prominent
vanilla
and
bourbon
are
present
as
well
growing
in
prominence
midpalate
with
the
brown
sugar
maple
sugar
and
honey
fruity
with
a
pronounced
english
yeast
character
this
is
great
warming
on
the
finish
with
lingering
flavors
of
caramel
and
toffee
theres
also
a
touch
of
spice
and
a
chocolate
liqueur
full
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
great
finish
i
guess
its
safe
to
say
that
im
not
filing
my
taxes
tonight
this
beer
is
just
a
thing
of
beauty
and
is
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
had
in
some
time
as
the
beer
warms
i
pick
up
a
bit
of
chocolate
as
well
just
very
very
nice
overall
ive
come
to
the
conclusion
that
my
favorite
ba
beers
are
english
barleywines
i
cant
think
of
a
better
style
of
beer
to
match
the
bourbon
characteristics
this
is
another
great
example
to
support
my
conclusion
d
sips
by
sip
this
doesnt
drink
all
that
slow
but
the
warming
sensation
gives
the
impression
that
this
is
only
a
couple
glasses
and
done
considering
the
11
nice
drinkability
d
the
taste
doesnt
quite
deliver
what
the
smell
promises
but
non
the
less
i
think
this
vintage
is
drinking
very
well
right
now
d
absolutely
delicious
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
that
was
probably
world
class
a
year
or
two
ago
the
flavors
have
mellowed
out
a
bit
and
its
extremely
drinkable
but
its
probably
lost
a
little
complexity
and
body
still
extremely
good
2007
vintage
pours
rosy
deep
copper
with
brown
hues
and
micro
thin
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
smooth
oak
moving
to
pine
hops
vanilla
caramel
and
bourbon
soaked
oak
the
taste
is
smooth
goodness
with
pine
hops
mixing
with
vanilla
and
a
mild
amount
of
bourbon
the
oak
picks
up
toward
midway
and
to
the
finish
with
increasing
bourbon
and
a
slight
alcohol
burn
yum
no
carbonation
to
talk
about
but
im
not
complaining
as
it
works
very
well
for
this
beer
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
syrupy
and
coating
on
the
palate
drinking
the
whole
750ml
by
myself
might
take
a
while
but
i
wouldnt
complain
if
i
had
to
do
it
d
sip
savor
and
repeat
until
the
bottle
is
empty
world
class
beer
outstanding
d
thanks
to
the
absurdly
generous
rallison
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
the
score
would
indicate
i
think
d
nope
too
big
too
thick
too
strong
smell
is
all
about
the
bourbon
barrelsome
vanilla
kind
of
thin
feel
in
the
mouth
not
much
carbonationtaste
on
the
bourbon
side
with
a
hint
of
chocolatevanilla
the
barrel
is
the
highlight
of
this
brew
certainly
not
sessionable
well
not
tonight
anyway
of
course
i
have
just
came
back
from
obriens
where
it
was
all
about
pliny
the
youngermy
bloody
valentinecask
stone
sublimely
so
this
review
may
be
tainted
lol
but
for
a
late
night
sipper
to
end
the
night
it
is
working
d
definitely
mellowed
out
the
hops
from
the
original
version
this
one
goes
down
nicely
despite
its
intensity
garnet
brown
color
with
significant
tan
carbonation
smells
of
bourbon
caramel
boozy
dark
fruits
and
wood
taste
is
more
of
the
same
not
too
hot
and
the
hops
are
totally
mellowed
out
compared
to
fresh
numbskull
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
really
nice
and
much
different
from
regular
numbskull
overall
one
of
the
best
barleywines
that
i
have
enjoyed
seek
out
a
must
try
cheers
if
i
had
the
chance
to
i
would
crack
this
bad
boy
as
much
as
possible
its
a
great
beer
reddish
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
smell
is
really
sweet
with
lots
of
bourbon
and
butterscotch
and
some
vanilla
sweet
caramel
quite
a
bit
of
booze
in
the
taste
as
well
as
oak
and
some
bourbon
flavors
high
carbonation
and
medium
body
thanks
to
iowaherkeye
for
sharing
a
sample
and
to
doubleo
for
giving
me
a
bottle
to
share
with
some
age
on
it
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
ages
and
hopefully
develops
overall
whatever
hangups
are
in
this
beer
with
the
sweetness
the
good
points
far
outweigh
any
negative
ones
this
showed
signs
of
complimentary
oxidation
the
malt
was
very
aggressive
in
the
flavor
with
notes
of
maple
and
tons
of
bourbon
the
nose
had
some
nice
tobacco
character
notes
from
and
tasted
on
11505
last
of
the
barrel
aged
alesmiths
i
needed
to
try
and
while
this
was
not
better
than
the
speedway
it
beat
out
the
wee
heavy
this
barleywine
has
really
mellowed
out
i
wish
i
would
not
have
traded
my
only
other
bottle
this
stuff
will
most
likely
improve
even
more
with
age
i
look
forward
to
next
batch
being
released
in
the
future
cannot
wait
to
drink
again
highly
recommended
a
great
beer
overall
and
im
very
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
its
not
something
id
reach
for
often
however
almost
no
head
at
all
even
with
a
vigorous
pour
only
a
skim
of
light
tan
bubbles
body
is
rich
brown
with
some
burgundy
notes
when
held
to
light
nose
has
a
very
nice
oaky
bourbon
character
with
toffee
and
carmel
malts
big
rich
but
mellow
and
smooth
on
first
sip
with
huge
bourbon
notes
carmalized
malts
give
way
to
dark
fruits
that
sour
slightly
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
a
dusting
of
mineral
based
spices
coats
the
back
of
the
tongue
as
well
creating
a
slightly
thick
mouthfeel
this
is
a
big
beer
and
the
bourbon
feel
almost
comes
back
to
bite
you
as
you
drink
more
about
a
10oz
pour
is
plenty
regular
old
numbskull
booze
it
was
as
if
the
barrelaging
was
fighting
the
original
character
of
the
beer
with
vanilla
and
booze
the
beautiful
bitter
hoppiness
i
have
tasted
in
numbskull
was
defeated
by
brute
strength
this
was
a
nice
complex
beer
but
i
feel
like
the
barrelaging
obscures
some
of
the
best
aspects
of
an
already
terrific
beer
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
fine
example
of
the
aging
process
and
the
metamorphosis
that
a
beer
can
go
through
in
a
barrel
aging
nothing
like
the
original
this
came
out
to
be
much
more
an
old
ale
then
a
hoppy
barley
wine
another
winner
from
alesmith
and
now
that
two
out
of
three
of
the
big
barrel
age
beers
from
alesmith
are
done
i
cannot
wait
to
get
a
hold
of
the
big
one
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
i
cant
say
its
better
than
the
base
in
fact
it
definitely
isnt
id
say
the
alcohol
content
is
about
20
so
keep
that
in
mind
if
youre
planning
on
pounding
a
few
before
driving
home
from
the
boardwalk
drinkability
in
a
lineup
of
various
ba
old
numbskull
vintages
i
greatly
favored
the
2004
bottling
powerfully
delicious
and
almost
cripplingly
good
2005
bottle
127
of
223
pours
a
murky
brownish
copper
zero
head
completely
still
regardless
of
how
aggressive
it
is
poured
aroma
is
a
strong
worn
leather
aroma
somewhat
salty
some
rich
tobacco
and
sweet
prunes
mixed
in
as
well
alcohol
is
evident
in
the
aroma
as
well
taste
shows
some
of
the
leather
and
salt
notes
but
they
are
much
more
mild
then
in
the
aroma
some
decent
sized
bourbony
bite
following
the
leather
and
pruniness
a
good
amount
of
vanilla
as
well
as
a
fairly
strong
drying
woodiness
before
a
bite
and
warmth
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
medium
low
carbonation
keeps
it
thinner
on
the
tongue
good
amount
of
drying
wood
and
biting
alcohol
in
the
finish
an
outstanding
barleywine
aroma
is
incredible
the
taste
is
powered
quite
a
bit
from
the
barrel
ageing
and
the
alcohol
is
big
as
well
though
never
too
much
a
very
good
beer
the
barleywine
characteristics
meld
perfectly
with
the
barrel
ageing
in
the
aroma
but
are
overwhelmed
in
the
taste
overall
i
liked
this
beer
as
i
knew
i
would
i
think
it
was
worth
the
20
i
hope
alesmith
puts
it
out
again

lots
of
tawny
pear

and
sweet
cream
vanilla
intended
for

quite
light
on
the
carbonation
which
is
a
bummer
theres
a
sweet
tinge
of
eurolike
hops
along
the
backedge
but
it
makes
the
old
hop
presentation
moan
as
this
is
more
subdued
and
to
my
liking
i
enjoyed
the
light
oxidization
character
of
this
beer
as
truer
to
the
plummy
raisinlike
sweetness
characters
of
the
style
but
without
carbonation
and
some
warmth
noticeable
from
the
barrel
i
dont
find
this
a
phenomenal
improvement
over
the
straight
version
i
tried
to
approach
this
beer
as
unbiased
as
possible
keeping
my
expectations
low
i
was
completely
blown
away
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
the
ba
speedway
already
working
on
another
trade
to
get
a
2004
bottle
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
worth
trading
another
prized
possession
to
get
one
a
sipper
indeed
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
goes
down
with
ease
and
not
much
alcohol
burn
at
all
im
really
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
bottle
thanks
to
blitheringidiot
i
doubt
ill
ever
lay
eyes
on
another
bottle
again
i
only
wish
alesmith
would
expand
their
barrel
aging
a
bit
so
these
bottles
wouldnt
be
so
damn
hard
to
find
worth
a
try
if
you
can
come
across
it

very
aromatic

the
wood
influence
is
unmistakable
showing
hints
of

along
with
the
malt
which
shows
a
bit
of
caramel

burnt
toffee
the
excessive
aromatic
hops
in
the
regular
old
numbskull
has
tamed
to
an
almost
undetectable
level
in
the
flavor

have

the

is
clearly
evident
notes
of

oak
caramel

with
a
touch

the
body
and
texture
is
lacking
this
should
have
been
aged
in
a
wine
barrel
a
bourbon
barrel
was
not
the
proper
vessel
for
this
beer
this
beer
has
mostly
become
a
vehicle
for
the
barrel
flavors
what
flavors
that
do
peak
through
from
the
old
numbskull
play
a
supporting
role
to
mitigate
roundout
the
oak
flavors
i
bet
you
a
mixture
of
half
fresh
numbskull
and
half
this
beer
would
be
quite
tasty
there
would
still
be
a
big
hop
and
malt
presence
to
balance
out
the
barrel
contribution
as
this
beer
stands
it
does
not
have
enough
balance
nor
complexity
to
be
great
i
have
never
been
a
fan
of
barrel
aged
beers
for
barrel
aged
beers
sake
i
really
prefer
a
bold
beer
flavor
with
the
supporting
role
being
played
by
the
barrel
character
in
this
case
the
barrel
character
plays
the
lead
role
and
somewhere
down
there
in
the
supporting
cast
there
is
an
aged
version
of
old
numbskull

that
its

seeking
even
if
youre
getting
tired
of

i
admire
the

gap
i
dont
know

age
would
really
help
that

its
pretty
well
integrated

is

are

fitting

state
im
glad
to
see
i
enjoyed
it
as
much
as

the

has
worked
very
similarly
with

this

excellent
barley
wine
very
drinkable
hot
as
hell
and
sweet
as
pie
makes
for
very
fine
drinking
overall
a
pretty
good
barleywine
though
it
probably
isnt
something
i
would
hunt
for
8
months
old
bottle
beautiful
clear
copper
colour
caramel
hazelnuts
and
a
bit
of
peppery
hops
on
the
nose
same
flavours
but
surprisingly
bitter
finish
no
alcohol
in
smell
and
taste
love
it
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
tasted
flavor
is
a
bit
lackluster
sweet
with
a
big
bitterness
at
the
finish
great
barleywine
still
ranks
up
there
as
one
of
the
best
the
flavors
are
strong
and
diverse
with
mostly
malty
tastes
i
get
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
but
not
the
sweet
variety
i
also
get
fig
and
dark
fruit
molasses
brown
sugar
maple
tea
leaf
barley
and
grainy
malt
its
a
bit
thin
but
the
11
is
completely
hidden
o
i
find
this
to
be
on
the
bitter
side
and
also
to
have
an
excessive
aged
sherry
character
but
it
is
still
complex
and
enjoyable
two
year
aged
old
numbskull
is
tasty
for
sure
but
i
recall
fresh
being
a
touch
better
for
its
more
vibrant
hop
character
time
trades
the
fresher
hops
and
hotter
booze
for
smooth
edges
fuller
feel
and
more
sweetness
all
in
all
you
cant
go
wrong
either
way
this
is
an
excellent
american
barleywine
overall
its
hoppy
which
i
know
everyone
doesnt
love
but
this
is
very
nice
overall
big
boozey
o
a
solid
american
barleywine
alesmith
hasnt
disappointed
me
yet
so
i
didnt
expect
that
they
would
here
will
get
another
bottle
and
cellar
it
for
a
little
longer
next
time
prost
o
very
well
done
wonderful
barleywine
and
incredibly
drinkable
even
considering
abv
and
fairly
assertive
hops
creamy
chewy
body
with
soft
medium
carbonation
overall
i
can
honestly
say
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
american
barleywine
beers
i
have
had
i
actually
had
one
of
my
favorite
a
few
hours
earlier
but
this
just
tops
it
by
a
few
notches
i
have
seen
and
hesitated
in
buying
this
and
finally
bit
the
bullet
because
i
have
been
impressed
with
other
alesmith
beers
this
one
hit
nail
in
the
coffin
kevin
approved
salud
nice
mahogany
brown
color
with
excellent
clarity
theres
a
quarter
inch
head
of
light
brown
foam
on
top
brussels
lacing
strangely
on
this
barleywine
i
smell
more
of
a
piney
hop
aroma
than
malt
the
taste
has
a
strong
pine
hop
edge
but
theres
plenty
of
malt
to
back
it
up
plenty
of
interplay
between
hops
and
malt
going
on
the
mouth
is
somewhat
stickybut
the
drink
ability
for
this
barleywine
is
quite
amazing
i
notice
hop
aroma
fades
as
it
sits
for
awhile
overall
its
a
very
easy
beer
to
get
down
despite
the
style
and
abv
i
enjoyed
every
sip
of
this
not
much
not
to
like
pours
an
incredible
deep
amber
with
a
tan
head
color
is
remarkable
on
this
aroma
is
deep
roasted
barley
grapes
alcohol
with
heavy
bready
nuttiness
taste
follows
the
aroma
well
with
some
residual
sweetness
and
a
tinge
of
hop
charecter
as
well
this
is
one
of
the
best
looking
beers
ive
ever
seen
and
the
flavor
is
tops
in
this
style
this
went
down
very
quick
good
stuff
o
different
and
delicious
barley
wine
for
such
a
heavy
beer
it
managed
to
be
pretty
refreshing
glad
to
try
it
its
awesome
see
this
brewery
available
in
il
overall
expected
it
to
be
a
lot
sluttier
but
everything
stays
in
good
taste
mostly
amber
malt
and
barrel
driven
but
the
hop
character
is
very
welcome
and
lifts
this
one
to
a
superb
level
overall
excellent
it
has
a
lot
going
on
and
does
a
good
job
balancing
and
not
making
anything
overwhelming
o
more
of
a
triple
ipa
than
a
barely
wine
it
needs
quite
a
bit
more
malt
to
be
the
balanced
barely
wine
i
was
expecting
this
is
my
first
alesmith
ale
maybe
they
are
all
on
the
hoppy
side
overall
great
and
one
of
the
top
end
barleywines
ive
ever
had
overall
ok
barleywine
but
too
much
over
the
top
alcohol
overall
a
very
good
brew
and
one
id
happily
have
again
maybe
a
bottle
to
myself
next
time
o
good
drinkability
alesmith
quality
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
ever
had
very
tasty
but
not
extremely
sweet
molasses
but
balanced
recommended
750ml
bottle
didnt
realize
i
had
this
for
so
long
2003
bottle
drank
in
feb
2014
this
one
pours
a
dark
caramel
color
there
was
about
no
head
on
mine
nor
was
there
any
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
nice
faint
citrus
hops
along
with
some
caramel
malts
no
sweetness
to
speak
of
possible
some
honey
and
raisins
in
there
as
well
as
some
toffee
and
biscuit
the
taste
is
excellent
a
slight
sweetness
as
well
as
a
definite
silky
texture
some
caramel
raisin
toffee
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
actually
a
faint
dryness
to
the
finish
a
wonderful
offering
overall
good
barley
wine
a
little
too
sweet
fresh
might
be
a
little
smoother
with
some
age
not
a
whole
lot
to
the
beer
that
makes
it
stand
out
but
it
is
a
very
nice
drinkable
beer
15
for
750ml
bottle
a
very
american
barleywine
ale
as
determined
by
its
aggressive
piney
hop
profile
that
is
just
as
prevalent
in
nose
and
taste
as
the
malt
here
which
is
what
english
barleywines
usually
showcase
more
of
a
balanced
offering
but
a
massive
one
beautiful
red
copper
glow
to
this
high
gravity
for
sure
under
a
khaki
head
an
inch
tall
and
thick
as
tar
lots
of
hops
on
the
nose
bitter
which
counters
the
sweetness
of
the
grain
well
and
it
transitions
right
into
the
flavor
but
grain
bill
no
doubt
caramel
sweetness
and
a
dried
fruit
complex
but
the
hops
wake
you
right
up
and
this
finishes
real
hoppy
and
bitter
like
all
the
foiled
alesmith
brews
the
alcohol
is
brilliantly
well
disguised
and
this
drinks
far
lighter
than
it
really
is
a
scary
bottle
to
finish
alone
but
i
would
be
happy
to
try
nice
example
of
the
highly
hopped
american
barleywine
o
a
great
id
say
americanstyle
barleywine
overall
tasty
stuff
but
straddles
the
line
between
bw
and
dipa
even
hoppy
bws
like
bigfoot
have
substantial
malt
flavors
when
young
this
one
leans
even
harder
on
the
hops
not
a
big
deal
as
i
like
both
styles
overall
another
excellent
beer
from
a
brewery
i
truly
admire
and
whose
beers
all
seem
to
kick
some
ass
but
one
must
admit
the
name
has
been
well
chosen
the
numbskull
after
purchasing
it
i
feel
exactly
like
one
a
stupid
person
thats
it
overall
a
very
well
made
barleywine
and
one
i
would
definately
buy
again
as
a
splurge
o
finally
getting
around
to
reviewing
on
this
is
very
good
despite
my
not
being
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
in
general
the
draft
is
excellent
and
i
think
better
than
out
of
the
bottle
freshness
may
play
a
role
in
this
overall
a
fairly
good
barleywine
though
mostly
forgettable
while
its
drinkability
is
there
it
fails
to
capture
the
spirit
of
uniqueness
andor
tenacity
of
your
outstanding
barleywine
in
the
end
it
comes
across
as
good
but
unremarkable
this
is
good
stuff
and
can
easily
sneak
up
you
recommended
o
i
was
quite
surprised
by
this
beer
ive
been
wanting
to
finally
try
a
solid
and
this
one
has
done
it
for
me
this
beer
is
extremely
well
rounded
and
almost
executed
perfectly
almost
gave
up
on
this
style
of
beer
but
this
one
will
keep
me
trying
more
of
this
style
well
done
alesmith
full
bodied
chewy
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
has
modest
carbonation
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
o
decent
but
might
need
a
little
more
time
for
it
to
peak
overall
a
really
great
take
on
the
american
barley
wine
style
big
upfront
earthy
hop
presence
with
a
good
balance
of
bready
caramel
malt
t
floral
hops
and
pine
held
up
by
a
big
toasted
bread
malt
backbone
orange
zest
toffee
and
some
sticky
floral
hop
resin
totally
unlike
any
other
barleywine
ive
had
and
i
like
it
o
a
pretty
characteristic
hoppy
american
barleywine
perhaps
a
bit
heavier
on
the
bitterness
than
most
but
tasty
nonetheless
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
bright
muddled
opaque
chestnutbrown
coloring
with
a
dense
creamy
offwhite
head
that
sits
low
and
slowly
settles
into
a
sparse
filmy
surface
coating
aromas
of
cedar
peat
cracker
and
biscuit
toffee
apple
pear
and
an
overall
fruitcake
character
smells
balanced
but
rich
and
imposing
at
the
same
time
flavors
of
toffee
and
roast
on
the
forward
tongue
with
hints
of
chocolate
to
follow
apple
pie
with
all
the
spices
some
subtle
tropical
fruit
notes
and
a
light
caramel
highlight
earthy
notes
pop
in
and
out
on
the
taste
buds
helping
to
keep
everything
in
some
semblance
of
balance
very
balanced
on
a
midbodied
feel
which
pulls
off
a
lightening
effect
on
the
heavy
robust
palate
the
aftertaste
is
roasted
sweetness
with
a
blending
of
all
the
rich
sugary
sweetness
together
with
all
of
the
fruit
characteristics
and
also
the
first
real
hints
of
booze
a
fruity
sweet
linger
at
the
end
both
tangy
and
slightly
cloying
into
a
slick
slightly
bitter
lingering
finish
tasty
brew
and
i
bet
it
ages
nicely
overall
i
thought
a
year
back
would
do
more
for
this
guy
interesting
and
complex
alcohol
well
hidden
if
you
dig
american
barleys
that
are
hopped
up
more
than
most
dipas
youll
probably
dig
this
personally
i
prefer
my
barleys
more
malt
centric
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
not
sure
if
this
would
have
been
better
fresh
or
not
never
really
intended
to
age
it
so
long
but
i
would
be
up
for
trying
a
newer
vintage
o
im
not
too
sure
what
to
think
about
this
beer
it
has
a
very
interesting
flavor
profile
and
the
finish
is
wonderful
i
think
this
would
pair
well
with
a
variety
of
heavy
meals
this
however
is
not
my
goto
alesmith
definitely
worth
a
try
though
and
i
would
definitely
want
to
age
this
750
ml
bottle

fantastic

and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
thanks
to
my
cousin
brian
for
this
one
750ml
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
murky
swamp
water
color
with
lots
of
sediment
floating
around
and
an
inch
of
head
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
boozey
with
sweet
caramel
and
bread
some
citrus
and
spicy

notes
the
taste
is
the
nice
alcohol
burn
with
some
orange
peel
and
caramel
some
breadiness
and
piney
hops
warming
alcohol
at
the
finish
pretty
well
balanced
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
well
crafted
barleywine
i
hope
i
can
grab
a
bottle
to
age
this
is
pretty
damn
unique
id
be
interested
to
see
how
the
barrel
aged
version
compares
bottom
line
good
old
numbskull
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
with
strong
flavors
bitterness
is
assertive
and
it
warms
well
probably
best
with
a
meal
ill
finish
this
bottle
with
dinner
tomorrow
this
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
an
ipa
it
starts
out
a
bit
sweet
but
the
hops
kick
in
so
fast
the
sweetness
is
quickly
overwhelmed
i
think
cutting
back
on
the
hops
a
bit
would
provide
a
better
balance
if
you
like
a
hoppy
beer
give
this
one
a
try
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
a
lot
of
hops
but
if
you
are
worth
trying
o
a
feel
like
i
caught
this
beer
at
a
strange
time
it
seems
like
it
is
inbetween
trying
to
be
hoppy
and
trying
to
be
malty
i
would
definitely
like
to
give
it
a
try
again
though
to
get
a
better
idea
of
where
the
sweet
spot
is
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
a
great
interpretation
of
a
hoppy
barelywine
o
this
is
a
massive
beer
the
flavours
are
very
complex
and
its
one
of
the
few
beers
that
you
can
smell
from
the
glass
when
its
on
the
table
in
friont
of
you
highly
recommended
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
though
it
could
have
a
little
more
hop
balance
this
was
well
worth
the
wait
its
listed
as
american
but
it
has
an
english
influence
o
a
solid
barleywine
all
around
alesmith
continues
to
impress
me
i
will
seek
this
one
out
again
including
other
offerings
from
this
great
brewery
o
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
barleywine
and
will
be
aiming
to
pick
some
more
up
so
i
can
age
it
to
perfection
o
a
solid
effort
nothing
particularly
noteworthy
other
than
the
heightened
yeast
flavor
and
the
moderate
depth
and
intensity
of
the
caramel
flavors
ive
got
to
cellar
this
one
overall
a
pretty
excellent
barleywine
id
like
to
have
a
real
fresh
one
to
compare
deep
maple
quite
clear
with
a
nice
frothy
offwhite
head
touch
of
orange
peel
brown
sugar
and
pine
pretty
nicely
done
the
mid
palate
is
exploding
with
flavors
of
citrus
pine
malt
maybe
even
a
tiny
hint
of
cocoa
finishes
strong
and
alcoholic
with
hints
of
sweetness
biscuit
grapes
and
citrus
however
a
touch
boozy
at
this
point
in
time
very
full
thick
and
chewy
body
and
fairly
brisk
carbonation
this
beer
has
much
potential
to
age
750
bottle
that
has
been
sitting
for
2
months
maybe
slightly
longer
pours
a
beautiful
deep
redorange
clear
with
big
creamy
head
that
has
an
orangebeige
hue
smells
like
serious
pine
and
toffee
was
surprised
at
the
hop
presence
in
the
aroma
here
nice
toffee
flavor
with
a
hit
of
hop
on
the
tongue
bit
of
grapefruit
and
slight
booze
but
hides
the
abv
awfully
well
this
is
a
bit
too
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
the
most
balanced
of
the
style
that
i
have
ever
encountered
very
nice
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
barleywine
it
aged
well
and
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
available
a
really
nice
barleywine
sure
its
not
barrel
aged
but
it
works
well
and
is
well
crafted
o
a
solid
barleywine
with
good
complexity
and
excellent
feel
alesmith
produces
well
crafted
brews
and
never
seems
to
disappoint
a
big
beer
but
still
very
enjoyable
tons
of
malt
and
balanced
with
big
resiny
and
piny
flavors
as
well
really
well
done
highly
recommended
o
this
beer
has
nicely
mellowed
over
the
year
and
could
be
a
little
dangerous
for
as
smooth
as
it
is
the
alcohol
warmth
is
there
but
one
could
easily
sip
themselves
into
a
stopper
if
the
was
served
in
a
pint
glass
purchased
this
and
avery
brewing
companys
hog
heaven
for
a
beer
club
barleywine
tasting
last
night
this
was
a
very
good
barleywine
better
than
most
of
the
competition
it
was
rich
and
dark
with
sweet
caramel
molasses
and
raisin
flavors
dominating
there
was
a
lot
of
boozy
warmth
and
very
little
hop
bitterness
near
the
end
old
numbskull
definitely
stood
out
among
the
crowd
as
an
exceptional
barleywine
this
was
a
fantastic
barleywine
the
abv
is
almost
completely
hidden
the
malt
is
sweet
but
not
cloying
full
flavored
and
delicious
there
is
just
enough
of
a
hop
bite
in
the
finish
to
round
this
one
out
this
is
delicious
and
dangerously
drinkable
i
will
definitely
try
to
get
my
hands
on
this
one
again
o
this
was
a
solid
drink
not
extremely
complex
as
the
malt
dominated
but
it
was
nicely
put
together
overall
this
is
a
super
enjoyable
barleywine
nice
hop
profile
and
plenty
dark
fruit
notes
i
only
wish
it
was
a
little
less
sweet
but
its
a
small
snafu
in
an
otherwise
really
enjoyable
brew
really
nice
stuff
overall
a
real
solid
barleywine
rich
and
big
and
delivering
on
all
fronts
simply
and
nicely
o
its
a
very
good
barleywine
and
it
will
stimulate
me
to
raid
my
cellar
for
some
of
the
other
american
barleywines
i
have
stashed
to
compare
a
really
good
fresh
barleywine
which
is
not
easy
to
do
always
this
beer
is
just
missing
a
little
special
something
to
move
it
into
the
elite
category
though
maybe
age
would
do
it
i
doubt
ill
ever
know
as
alesmith
is
never
going
to
distribute
in
my
neighborhood
but
i
can
always
hope
and
dream
though
i
bet
this
is
exceptional
in
its
ba
form
another
winner
from
alesmith
drink
good
barleywine
i
liked
all
the
flavors
and
the
balance
that
this
had
was
overly
done
but
still
carried
a
lot
of
balance
to
it
id
like
to
age
a
bottle
not
sure
how
to
date
them
though
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
decent
amount
of
boozy
sweetness
that
lingers
over
the
strong
malt
flavors
and
earthy
hops
into
a
warm
finish
dry
earthy
hops
up
front
are
somewhat
stalefaded
but
the
flavor
is
still
there
adding
complexity
to
this
intense
beer
earthy
and
leathery
malt
compliment
the
hops
befoe
being
countered
by
toffee
fig
raisin
and
caramel
sweetness
theres
plenty
ofvalcohol
sweetness
and
warmth
in
the
finish
but
its
not
overly
hot
and
the
high
abv
is
relatively
well
masked
well
balanced
and
complex
but
definitely
a
sipper
im
glad
i
sat
on
this
one
for
a
while
because
its
drinking
very
nicely
3
years
later
overall
quite
an
enjoyable
barleywine
not
the
knockout
i
was
hoping
for
but
quite
yummy
o
not
worth
the
14
99
i
paid
for
it
but
a
good
offering
nonetheless
id
be
interested
to
try
this
one
again
for
sure
will
compare
with
weyerbacher
insanity
tomorrow
o
this
beer
is
quite
hoppy
quite
unlike
other
beers
in
the
style
i
think
this
would
be
a
barleywine
that
would
be
enjoyed
by
hopheads
because
it
tastes
like
a
hybrid
between
a
barleywine
and
an
imperial
ipa
pours
a
dark
nearly
opaque
honeyamber
with
flecks
of
floating
vegetable
matter
and
barley
malt
particles
a
huge
fluffy
caramelcolored
orangehued
head
forms
in
fact
it
overflowed
my
glass
and
i
didnt
even
pour
as
aggressively
as
i
normally
do
asymmetrical
lacing
and
clumps
of
suds
stick
to
the
glass
aromas
of
toffee
cherry
and
sorghum
dominate
citrus
and
alcohol
sensations
in
the
olfactory
it
has
a
thick
smooth
mouthfeel
flavors
of
ultra
sweet
brown
sugar
and
sorghum
up
front
a
little
citrus
tartness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
accentuated
by
a
mild
carbonation
burn
it
has
a
sugary
butterscotch
hard
candy
finish
a
good
dessert
sipper
i
meant
to
try
this
beer
fresh
but
wanted
a
barleywine
and
not
a
iipa
i
got
what
i
wanted
its
smooth
sweet
boozy
in
a
good
way
and
super
enjoyable
the
barrelaged
version
of
this
beer
must
really
be
something
i
dont
think
id
drink
this
very
often
but
i
will
certainly
try
to
keep
1
or
2
bottles
on
hand
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
big
malt
quality
through
the
nose
and
flavoring
we
were
actually
surprised
to
find
as
much
hops
as
we
did
on
the
back
there
which
really
added
to
the
final
bitterness
amongst
darker
malts
and
biting
booze
while
the
booze
was
certainly
prominent
it
was
one
of
those
cases
where
it
added
to
the
flavoring
of
the
beer
rather
than
drowning
out
other
flavors
this
is
a
standup
barleywine
overall
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
while
im
not
normally
a
fan
of
really
hoppy
barley
wines
this
one
is
so
well
done
that
it
works
well
o
a
nice
dry
hoppy
americanstyle
barleywine
not
ridiculously
sweet
like
so
many
high
abv
barleywines
thanksfully
a
nice
departure
with
the
hoppiness
too
it
adds
complexity
while
maintaining
the
balance
of
flavors
surprisingly
drinkable
for
an
11
brew
overall
very
nice
if
i
pick
up
again
ill
let
it
age
more
overall
old
numbskull
is
by
far
the
most
drinkable
barleywines
that
i
have
had
i
would
have
had
no
problem
finishing
the
750
o
an
awesome
barleywine
hops
and
malt
play
off
each
other
perfectly
even
at
11
abv
i
happily
finished
a
750ml
i
would
recommend
this
beer
very
highly
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
im
kind
of
sorry
that
i
sat
this
long
on
it
but
i
have
to
admit
that
i
tend
to
lean
towards
the
english
barley
wines
and
the
balance
and
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
put
it
down
i
think
the
next
chance
i
get
ill
pick
up
2
and
put
one
down
and
kill
the
other
quickly
and
see
what
the
difference
may
be
plenty
of
great
smell
plenty
of
great
flavors
and
a
body
that
lets
you
know
youre
drinking
a
real
beer
as
opposed
to
some
watered
down
oat
soda
o
delicious
and
incredibly
complex
and
deep
really
well
balanced
alcohol
is
definitely
present
but
not
in
a
bad
way
it
adds
to
the
intensity
and
makes
you
realize
that
it
is
11
originally
reviewed
06072011
o
it
might
have
been
excellent
were
it
not
for
the
disappointing
mouthfeel
a
touch
of
carbonation
redeems
numbskull
from
the
tactile
dustbin
i
would
recommend
the
beer
broadly
though
id
steer
you
towards
the
speedway
stout
first
overall
competent
o
alesmith
makes
great
beer
this
reminded
me
of
an
american
barleywine
meets
a
double
ipa
meets
stones
double
bastard
a
very
complex
array
of
flavors
and
a
very
rewarding
drink
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
okay
it
sits
on
the
fence
between
an
american
barleywine
and
a
dipa
i
think
it
leans
a
little
bit
more
toward
a
dipa
the
whole
stale
hops
taste
makes
me
think
that
this
bottle
has
sat
on
the
shelf
for
a
long
time
so
take
that
into
consideration
when
reading
this
review
but
if
this
beer
was
in
fact
fresh
it
was
a
dissapointment
alesmith
please
put
a
date
on
your
bottles

a

that
straddles

and
is

of
the
style
this
is
a
big
slow
sipper
really
nice
for
a
hoppy
barleywine
nice
full
bodied
beer
here
with
good
carbonation
leaves
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
overall
this
one
is
pretty
solid
a
little
bit
on
the
hoppier
side
than
other
barely
wines
i
have
had
but
thats
not
bad
at
all
good
but
doesnt
scream
barleywine
to
me
more
of
a
dipa
overall
i
love
this
i
think
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
despite
the
high
abv
and
just
so
easy
and
nice
and
complex
o
classy
sipping
beer
for
sure
tasty
keeping
another
2010
to
go
along
with
my
2011
and
will
pick
up
a
2012
as
well
for
a
vertical
this
year
o
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
they
fell
flat
literally
alcohol
content
kicks
in
after
the
first
glass
that
combined
with
the
syrupy
mouthfeel
makes
for
pretty
low
drinkability
id
like
to
try
another
bottle
of
this
or
have
some
on
tap
for
comparison
to
see
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
o
rather
disappointed
by
this
was
expecting
so
much
more
big
thanks
goes
out
ot
my
doppelganger
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
as
a
pregame
to
a
tasting
served
from
bottle
into
a
bells
stemmed
tulip
poured
reddish
brown
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
half
a
finger
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
citrus
citrus
hop
and
caramel
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
citrus
citrus
hop
caramel
caramel
hop
dark
fruit
and
dark
chocolate
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
all
aspects
of
this
one
were
very
solid
the
aroma
was
quite
nice
and
complex
on
this
one
and
this
complexity
carried
over
to
the
flavor
as
well
this
fact
made
it
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
a
definite
must
try
if
you
have
not
done
so
before
doa
o
layers
of
complexity
run
through
this
bold
and
somewhat
flagrant
beer
deep
maltiness
provides
a
base
for
heavy
handed
hopping
but
expresses
wonderful
sweetness
while
american
hops
are
bold
and
brazen
the
end
result
is
a
fairly
balanced
though
hopleaning
barleywine
thats
sure
to
sneak
by
you
with
its
strength
this
bottle
was
average
but
i
seem
to
remember
drinking
another
bottle
or
two
and
liking
them
a
good
deal

creamy

feel
very
nice
and
well
made
a
year
old
bottle
with
mostly
refrigerator
storage
an
obvious
candidate
for
further
aging
dr
very
drinkable
especially
for
the
high
abv
itd
definitely
be
better
aged
which
is
a
strange
thing
to
say
considering
how
hopcentric
it
tastes
i
dont
know
that
theyve
fully
resolved
the
battle
between
malts
and
hops
for
control
of
the
focus
but
this
remains
an
experimental
and
bold
brew
that
seems
to
challenge
the
conventions
of
the
style
o
a
lot
of
flavor
and
aroma
in
this
beer
also
the
pleasant
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
really
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
o
not
a
bad
barleywine
but
it
felt
like
something
was
missing
maybe
a
fresher
bottle
is
what
id
be
interested
in
but
there
are
some
nice
flavors
overall
a
really
nice
barleywine
with
a
nice
hop
bite
really
smooth
balanced
and
fresh
tasting
i
would
be
interested
to
see
how
this
evolves
over
time
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
as
i
mentioned
before
im
no
expert
when
it
comes
to
barleywine
but
i
am
thoroughly
enjoying
this
one
and
much
prefer
it
to
stones
although
that
is
solid
and
cheaper
o
i
love
this
brew
its
like
hop
juice
my
favorite
barleywine
to
date
o
overall
im
very
pleased
with
my
choice
here
and
feel
like
this
is
one
of
the
better
barley
wine
beers
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
o
not
the
greatest
barleywine
good
flavors
but
a
bit
rough
96100
o
may
be
the
finest
barley
wine
ive
had
to
date
this
being
my
first
review
should
also
say
something
i
felt
compelled
to
write
about
this
beer
alesmith
has
made
a
near
perfect
blend
of
creaminess
sweetness
and
bitterness
that
is
a
wonderfully
drinkable
high
abv
beer
the
only
fault
i
would
say
is
that
its
too
stealthy
if
thats
even
a
bad
thing
ill
start
off
by
saying
this
jesus
h
christ
where
have
you
been
all
my
life
this
is
an
incredible
incredible
beer
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
ruby
red
with
a
thin
wispy
head
the
nose
is
a
wonderful
blend
of
vanilla
and
bourbon
the
taste
is
much
the
same
this
is
a
masterful
flavor
profile
so
smooth
and
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderful
its
very
soft
on
the
tongue
despite
the
bourbonic
finish
overall
i
have
a
tough
time
remembering
a
better
11
spent
i
wish
to
hell
id
have
bought
a
lot
more
and
will
when
i
see
it
again
o
alesmith
really
never
seems
to
disappoint
this
is
just
another
example
of
that
great
beer
probably
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
definetely
work
it
final
thought
my
first
time
having
this
beer
such
a
nice
ale
10
and
11
abv
san
diego
made
you
know
its
yummy
overall
this
is
a
mighty
tasty
beer
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
but
definitely
felt
at
11
0
abv
recommended
that
you
try
this
and
maybe
sit
on
it
for
awhile
to
let
the
alcohol
mellow
o
i
enjoy
the
flavors
not
quite
big
enough
though
i
like
my
barley
wines
bigger
than
this
to
be
honest
i
think
alaskan
beat
this
on
all
marks
besides
the
appearance
this
is
the
clear
winner
in
that
category
for
me
o
this
is
a
good
american
barleywine
it
starts
hoppy
and
as
it
warms
turns
more
syrupy
and
sweeter
the
alcohol
stays
subdued
for
most
of
the
glass
id
be
curious
to
see
what
some
barrelaging
would
do
to
this
one
overall
a
very
well
made
beer
but
nothing
special
its
hard
to
tell
if
more
age
would
have
helped
but
the
hops
are
still
strong
after
at
least
a
year
overall
a
solid
barlywine
for
sure
my
first
alesmith
brew
and
it
didnt
dissapoint
pours
a
murky
dark
amber
with
a
2
inch
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
random
chunks

stick
to
the

on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of

brown
sugar
caramel

of

and

taste
is

brown
sugar
caramel
toffee
citrus
fruit
citrus
juice
and
citrus
zest
a
mild
bittersweet
flavor
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
medium
body
and
is
smooth
on
the
drink
down
overall
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
with
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
old
numbskull
is
a
pretty
impressive
american
barleywine
this
bottle
is
a
little
old
although
im
not
sure
how
old
there
really
isnt
much
in
the
hop
department
going
on
at
this
point
id
be
interested
to
see
if
they
are
more
vibrant
in
a
fresh
bottle
my
only
other
complaints
are
the
body
and
the
carbonation
more
body
and
bubbles
would
be
good
really
good
stuff
in
any

buttery
bitter
dryish
non
cloying
non
syrupy
so
fresh
oily
and
quick
on
the
palate
good
mouthfeel
overall
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
example
of
a
barleywine
the
big
complex
hoppy
and
malty
flavors
come
together
and
provide
a
prototypical
barleywine
experience
this
falls
in
line
with
what
i
expect
in
a
barleywine
and
am
sure
i
will
be
drinking
this
one
again
within
the
next
month
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
kittle
thin
for
a
barley
wine
it
could
have
been
thicker
and
deeper
in
flavor
o
nice
beer
easy
drinker
and
fairly
easy
to
get
messed
up
on
o
a
very
well
brewed
barleywine
and
an
incredibly
complex
sipper
pours
a
dark
amber
color
that
forms
a
two
finger
frothy
white
head
great
lacing
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
sediment
is
floating
throughout
smell
notes
of
rich
caramel
dark
fruits
sweet
malt
light
hops
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
initial
taste
was
sweet
apples
with
caramel
also
can
taste
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
in
the
backbone
a
slight
touch
of
alcohol
that
warmed
the
stomach
great
carbonation
and
nice
and
crisp
finish
overall
this
a
must
try
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
sip
on
it
and
would
love
to
drink
more
in
the
future
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
reddish
color
with
2
fingers
of
frothy
of
white
head
that
recedes
extremely
slowly
the
smell
is
malt
s
booze
and
a
huge
dose
of
piney
hops
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
that
helps
to
balance
out
the
bitterness
from
all
the
hops
and
there
is
a
piney
spicey
hop
flavor
followed
by
big
booziness
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carbed
with
a
medium
to
full
mouth
feel
and
a
fairly
bitter
nifinsh
overall
a
fairly
good
american
barleywine
but
could
definitely
use
some
age
on
it
with
thanks
to
mrkennedy
and
pours
a
hazy
golden
copper
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
two
finger
creamy
head
and
sporadic
lacingthe
smell
is
golden
caramelhoney
and
piney
hopsthe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
has
tastes
of
toffee
soaked
bitterhopscaramelboiled
candymarzipan
and
honeyoverall
its
very
sessionable
for
its
abv
and
i
could
drink
this
all
night
with
its
abv
very
well
hidden
cheers
d
a
good
barleywine
very
straightforward
and
basic
for
the
style
but
its
a
solid
one
at
that
o
great
barleywine
awesome
that
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
really
good
stuff
overall
a
good
barleywine
that
hits
most
of
the
spots
not
amazing
but
very
good
and
consistent
o
this
is
almost
the
hoppiest
barleywine
ive
ever
had
behind
only
averys
hog
heaven
what
its
missing
is
some
more
of
that
barleywine
sweetness
malt
and
dark
fruit
backbone
still
very
good
good
thing
i
have
another
in
the
cellar
thanks
to
22crowns
o
overall
another
great
barleywine
very
easy
to
drink
considering
the
abv
and
super
smooth
with
a
lot
of
nice
fruit
and
caramel
in
the
nose
and
mouth
would
love
to
have
again
im
personally
not
a
fan
of
hoppy
barleywines
but
this
one
is
very
solid
definitely
worth
revisiting
in
the
future
to
see
how
an
aged
bottle
tastes
and
whether
the
robust
malt
potential
develops
any
further
edit
there
was
no
cork
underneath
the
cap
is
this
typical
o
very
drinkable
still
it
seems
perfunctory
and
doesnt
wow
me
in
any
way
d
straddles
the
line
between
english
and
american
barleywine
hop
bitterness
is
fairly
restrained
overall
a
very
good
barleywine
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
props
to
em
for
bringing
this
to
the
sdibf
11
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
brownish
amber
color
the
head
is
nice
then
it
settles
into
a
bubbly
white
film
of
the
beer
leaving
some
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
malty
but
there
are
way
mote
hops
on
the
nose
for
sure
the
taste
is
a
little
citrusy
sweet
with
a
good
malty
finsh
the
hops
really
kick
ass
on
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
yet
has
a
great
bitter
quality
overall
its
a
barley
for
the
head
head
i
think
pretty
impressive
brew
it
think
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
american
barleywine
imo
id
stop
short
of
calling
it
truly
outstanding
but
no
question
its
flavorful
and
enjoyable
i
would
be
very
open
to
a
revisit
fairly
deep
bronze
color
decent
level
of
co2
going
on
buttery
malty

quite
sweet

the

nice

great
us
barleywine
and
a
real
sipper
on
a
cool
spring
evening
o
it
is
a
really
drinkable
great
beer
the
booziness
is
a
little
overpowering
in
the
finish
but
overall
it
is
a
really
great
beer
this
beer
covers
all
the
bases
and
im
certainly
glad
that
i
have
more
in
the
cellar
i
wish
i
could
have
tried
it
fresh
as
well
on
a
side
note
another
good
beer
on
tap
at
instant
replay
5
for
a
goblet
of
it
pretty
great
deal
beer
begins
looking
up
in
flavor
seriously
about
damn
time
beer
is
medium
in
body
thick
on
the
palate
mildly
bitter
at
the
end
but
entirely
from
grains
a
late
residual
sweetness
not
my
favorite
but
a
decent
beer
overall
sucks
im
ending
my
night
with
such
an
unremarkable
beer
md
medium
body
medium
carbonation
a
good
representation
of
the
style
nothing
outstanding
but
very
solid
barleywine
o
this
one
followed
the
mother
of
all
storms
and
i
must
say
it
didnt
fall
flat
this
is
a
quality
american
barleywine
that
i
would
recommend
without
hesitation
chestnut
in
color
with
a
firm
offwhite
head
this
beer
is
clear
and
relatively
low
in
carbonation
the
aroma
is
intense
with
malt
caramel
and
bread
with
a
little
alcohol
and
fruit
as
well
the
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
with
a
sharp
alcohol
bite
the
hops
are
not
pronounced
in
the
aroma
but
intense
hop
bitterness
comes
out
in
the
taste
west
coast
the
body
is
a
little
light
for
the
style
but
still
sufficiently
rich
nice
balance
for
the
style
lingering
hop
finish
accented
by
the
warmth
overall
good
o
nice
barleywine
and
one
with
a
pretty
big
hop
presence
one
bottle
was
defnitely
enough
i
was
worried
that
the
sweetness
would
make
this
one
hard
to
finish
but
i
was
able
to
get
through
it
d
with
the
strength
and
bottle
size
one
is
plenty
on
the
other
hand
i
found
it
easy
to
put
away
the
whole
bottle
a
great
barleywine
pick
it
up
if
you
see
it
pours
a
clear
red
color
with
some
bubbles
on
the
top
the
aroma
is
strong
with
apples
and
bread
the
taste
has
hints
of
apple
cherry
raisins
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
velvety
and
finishes
with
a
nice
fruity
aftertaste
the
alcohol
is
a
little
present
as
it
goes
down
your
throat
overall
a
great
barleywine
i
bought
this
bottle
recently
but
it
tastes
like
it
already
has
a
bit
of
age
on
it
also
some
clear
carbonation
issues
hard
to
put
down
the
whole
bottle
cause
of
those
flaws
d
overall
imo
a
very
nice
barleywine
rich
creamy
and
sweet
not
overly
sweet
and
would
definitely
purchase
another
bottle
at
11
abv
no
problem
drinking
the
entire
bottle
watchout
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
a
tough
one
to
have
more
than
one
glass
id
recommend
splitting
a
bottle
with
friends
alesmith
make
some
great
beers
and
old
numbskull
is
one
of
them
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
beer
definitely
holds
true
to
the
definition
of
american
barleywines
with
its
strong
hop
character
and
fruitiness
i
think
i
want
to
try
and
age
on
of
these
things
to
see
what
kind
of
flavor
changes
happen
my
local
beer
store
is
selling
a
750ml
or
about
25
oz
bottle
for
10
99
and
i
recommend
you
pick
one
of
these
up
as
its
good
stuff
d
an
interesting
take
on
the
american
barleywine
the
appearance
and
nose
are
spot
on
but
from
there
the
drinker
is
treated
to
a
slight
departure
from
expectations
in
the
other
facets
another
excellent
job
from
alesmith
a
brewery
that
never
disappoints
d
danger
will
robinson
this
bad
boy
clocks
in
at
11
abv
and
hides
it
very
well
a
bottle
is
a
bit
pricey
so
this
is
good
for
an
occasional
treat
overall
another
awesome
alesmith
beer
that
i
overlook
far
too
often
one
of
my
favorite
american
barleywines
and
really
fantastic
when
fresh
i
feel
it
is
more
balanced
like
a
english
barley
wine
without
the
heaviness
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
it
held
up
well
after
a
couple
of
years
im
guessing
the
alcohol
burn
has
mellowed
over
time
tasty
and
well
balanced
d
this
is
a
good
barleywine
big
and
sweet
a
medium
carbonation
that
is
goes
good
with
the
hops
makes
it
even
more
drinkable
there
is
not
a
strong
heat
character
in
this
beer
which
made
me
happy
i
am
going
to
track
down
a
fresh
bottle
and
rereview
raisiny
alcohol
up
front
with
a
big
malt
body
toasty
caramel
surprisingly
smooth
at
11
and
not
much
hop
flavor
but
shows
a
biting
resinous
hop
bitterness
shows
less
oxidation
in
the
taste
it
reminds
me
of
a
burnt
raisin
bagel
in
a
good
way
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
that
gets
better
the
further
into
the
bottle
you
get
to
style
yet
different
smooth
but
has
enough
rough
edges
to
make
it
a
sipper
and
keep
you
on
edge
i
like
it
but
not
sure
about
the
ageability
pours
a
slightly
hazy
almost
clear
reddish
amber
color
with
a
small
cream
colored
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
very
malty
with
strong
fig
aroma
figs
and
raisins
come
through
the
scent
the
most
but
there
are
also
other
dark
fruits
and
toffee
in
there
i
also
get
raw
honey
and
chocolate
taste
is
quite
exquisite
very
well
balanced
with
the
hops
malt
and
dark
fruits
this
one
has
been
aged
over
a
year
so
im
sure
its
more
hoppy
when
fresh
but
this
just
tastes
great
i
get
vanilla
toffee
and
honey
too
the
alcohol
is
definitely
there
but
balance
almost
perfectly
throughout
all
the
flavors
fantastic
barley
wine
style
ale
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
fullbodied
without
being
too
syrupy
drinkability
is
fairly
high
this
is
a
very
rich
beer
almost
like
a
dessert
but
it
doesnt
bring
down
the
drinkability
very
much
ps
for
those
of
you
on
ba
who
are
lamentingdebating
troegs
nugget
nectar
and
bells
hopslam
i
may
suggest
you
may
consider
a
pause
to
consider
this
not
the
same
style
but
wow
it
may
give
you
some
perspective
d
this
is
a
good
hoppy
barleywine
thats
very
enjoyable
with
its
good
taste
its
a
little
too
easy
to
drink
worth
picking
up
to
give
it
a
try
sometime
an
average
pour
yields
a
supersized
frothy
head
of
reddish
tan
delicate
large
bubbles
which
dimples
down
to
the
surface
while
wispy
the
lacing
pretty
much
there
for
good
vibrant
sunset
red
color
all
burnt
and
aglow
the
orange
influence
helps
maintain
transparency
and
brightness
only
few
scattered
microbubbles
to
be
seen
tangerine
grapefruit
initiates
its
presence
in
your
nose
the
pine
vanilla
cream
coal
tar
moss
and
lichens
toffee
hit
you
scattershot
takes
awhile
to
sort
it
all
out
the
breadiness
is
sweet
and
close
to
fruitcake
however
the
nectarine
apricot
pineapple
scents
not
aggressive
overall
the
hops
clearly
in
control
and
while
messy
the
good
kind
of
messy
mediumbodied
and
lighter
of
touch
than
expected
the
carbonation
flips
the
flavors
like
flapjacks
in
your
mouth
here
you
feel
the
alcohol
and
theres
a
whiskey
vanilla
oak
barrel
aspect
upfront
the

with

you
get
additional

coating
overall
sweet
and
not
that
dry
while
at
the
same
time
not
uncritically
relying
on
sugar
to
impress
hard
to
fully
accept
it
within
its
typed
idiom
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
to
light
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
quite
a
contrasting
brew
from
start
to
finish
from
fruity
sweet
to
herbal
and
bitter
very
bold
and
enjoyable
it
wouldnt
hurt
to
have
a
few
of
these
in
the
house
with
varying
ages
outstanding
example
of
a
barleywine
good
balance
nothing
excessive
or
in
your
face
that
is
typical
of
american
versions
of
the
style
very
nice
highly
recommended
pours
a
reddish
amber
little
to
no
head
with
almost
no
carbonation
smell
dark
fruity
notes
plumsraisins
resiny
malty
and
somewhat
boozy
taste
lots
of
sugar
malts
not
much
alcohol
lacks
the
flavor
and
complexity
i
was
expecting
in
this
barleywine
medium
bodied
no
carbonation
dry
finish
very
drinkable
for
11
but
not
much
flavor
or
reason
to
drink
would
not
purchase
again
old
numbskull
is
a
pretty
refined
take
on
its
style
the
flavors
are
distinct
and
clean
the
bitterness
is
amped
up
but
used
to
great
effect
and
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
at
least
as
far
as
the
taste
is
concerned
d
no
trace
of
the
alcohol
anywhere
i
like
the
darker
roasted
malts
here
but
there
arent
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
id
describe
this
as
lightly
sweet
with
a
mild
bitter
finish
the
flavor
seems
sort
of
faded
or
washed
out
especially
the
hops
but
without
a
bottle
date
its
hard
to
tell
if
that
was
the
original
intent
not
my
favorite
by
any
means
but
a
solid
barleywine
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
yellow
highlights
and
had
a
thin
bubbly
head
and
left
a
little
frothy
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
a
nice
bouquet
of
hops
are
noticeable
on
the
first
whiff
with
caramel
coming
through
as
well
alongside
candied
sugar
notes
but
faint
dark
fruit
character
the
booze
comes
out
more
on
taste
but
meshes
good
with
the
caramel
notes
alongside
hopppy
and
slight
brown
sugar
accents
it
still
had
some
good
sweetness
from
the
malts
and
candied
sugar
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
slight
dark
fruity
hoppy
and
sticky
finish
it
drank
pretty
good
and
the
hoppy
bite
did
add
a
little
dimension
to
this
barleywine
alesmith
does
the
style
right
solid
barleywine
probably
an
older
bottle
tough
getting
through
this
too
sweet
for
me
2009
vintage
pours
from
the
750
ml
bottle
a
medium
to
dark
clear
reddishorange
color
with
a
little
white
head
on
top
aromas
of
toffee
caramel
citrusy
hops
and
a
little
vanilla
medium
bodied
and
drinkable
hides
the
11
alcohol
fairly
well
flavors
of
citrusy
hops
sugary
fruits
and
sweet
caramel
a
nice
barleywine
easily
drinkable
for
its
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thicker
side
with
carbonation
being
below
average
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
low
drinkability
is
good
it
was
a
very
nice
barleywine
to
sip
on
this
evening
the
hoppy
citrus
flavors
went
pretty
well
with
the
big
malty
and
caramel
flavors
and
really
balanced
them
out
as
well
very
good
beer
overall
d
goes
down
dangerously
easy
great
kick
nice
representation
of
style
if
it
werent
for
the
abv
i
would
drink
this
beer
all
night
d
i
really
could
not
detect
the
11
a
b
v
at
all
this
is
very
smooth
drinking
beer
that
is
not
exceptional
but
was
quite
tasty
and
will
be
worth
another
try
in
the
future
this
is
very
drinkable
and
a
solid
barleywine
i
would
be
happy
to
have
it
again
d
smooth
drinker
solid
beer
i
always
enjoy
drinking
beers
from
alesmith
they
have
yet
to
have
let
me
down
still
trying
to
work
out
my
feelings
for
this
beer
but
i
think
i
like
it
at
the
very
least
i
think
its
well
made
and
id
like
to
know
how
old
the
bottle
i
had
was
ill
certainly
be
seeking
out
more
to
investigate
further
d
very
good
barleywine
delicious
and
intense
might
be
a
bit
dangerous
on
the
11
overall
a
wonderful
barleywine
very
drinkable
given
the
abv
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
would
recommend
this
and
wish
i
had
another
bottle
drinkability
easily
one
of
the
tastiest
barleywines
ive
had
the
luxury
of
tasting
in
quite
some
time
its
super
drinkable
and
has
definitely
hit
the
sweet
spot
in
terms
of
malthop
balance
alesmith
is
a
great
brewery
and
between
this
beer
and
speedway
stout
im
in
love
thanks
much
jeff
drinkability
this
ones
probably
around
or
perhaps
just
past
its
peak
i
dont
really
see
it
getting
too
much
more
spectacular
with
age
as
the
hops
have
definitely
hit
their
stride
and
seem
to
be
on
a
downward
trajectory
even
though
the
alcohol
bite
has
completely
faded
after
finishing
the
750
im
fearful
of
tackling
the
bal
750
but
ill
soldier
on
somehow
right
so
you
definitely
can
feel
the
11
here
even
if
you
cant
taste
it
however
as
it
stands
this
is
a
remarkably
wellaged
complex
mature
easydrinking
beer
crack
em
if
you
got
em
and
crack
em
alongside
a
bal
version
of
the
same
if
you
got
em
who
knows
when
the
next
time
alesmith
will
grace
us
with
bal
versions
of
this
or
any
of
their
other
brews
may
be
highly
recommended
and
cheers
old
numbskull
has
a
very
clear
light
brown
appearance
there
is
a
moderate
amount
of
head
and
lacing
sweet
malts
with
hints
of
caramels
toffee
and
alcohol
are
the
basic
make
up
of
the
scents
and
tastes
alcohol
is
pretty
evident
throughout
the
smell
taste
and
finish
of
the
beer
the
feel
is
decent
with
a
prominent
butterscotch
candy
note
in
the
back
which
i
find
to
be
rather
enjoyable
d
easy
enough
to
finish
my
share
of
this
bottle
this
is
still
a
brewery
i
wish
i
had
access
to
here
in
illinois
pretty
hoppy
for
an
english
barleywine
too
strong
to
reach
for
another
tastes
just
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
sweet
caramel
toffee
warming
alcohol
and
a
good
dose
of
hop
bitterness
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
if
only
i
could
get
a
few
if
these
for
the
cold
winters
up
here
i
would
be
very
happy
d
13
for
the
bottle
but
i
think
id
rather
drink
this
than
a
40
bottle
of
fantastic
wine
the
depth
of
flavors
is
endless
i
finished
the
bottle
too
easily
a
wonderful
brew
that
has
been
masterfully
crafted
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
and
smooth
surprisingly
drinkable
for
such
a
strong
beer
750
ml
bottle
2009
tasted
around
122809
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
little
bubbly
tan
head
and
beautiful
lacing
caramel
pine
perfume
and
some
tropical
fruit
in
the
aroma
typical
bitterness
of
a
west
coast
barley
wine
followed
by
a
little
sweet
caramel
finish
pretty
thin
bodied
decent
carbonation
abv
hidden
extremely
well
especially
if
this
was
a
fresh
bottle
solid
west
coast
barley
wine
but
didnt
seem
too
much
like
an
english
wouldve
liked
it
to
be
a
little
more
malt
forward
overall
an
excellent
barleywine
rich
and
warming
recommended
d
this
beer
was
very
well
made
and
holding
up
as
it
did
with
age
just
proved
it
perfect
bottle
for
the
cellar
i
personally
loved
the
fact
that
it
was
so
drinkable
with
the
abv
so
high
do
yourself
a
favor
and
get
a
bottle
to
try
and
a
to
cellar
alesmith
you
have
done
it
yet
again
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
sticky
syrupy
and
chewy
i
poured
from
a
25
ounce
bottle
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
tawny
port
amber
with
a
massive
sticky
white
head
it
leaves
nice
lacing
all
along
the
glass
there
are
big
piney
hop
aromas
on
the
nose
the
beer
is
thick
and
full
of
piney
resin
the
high
abv
is
well
hidden
making
this
a
bit
dangerous
it
finishes
with
a
lingering
bitter
pine
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
very
smooth
imo
this
is
more
of
an
american
than
english
barleywine
and
i
graded
it
as
such
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
d
at
11
im
amazed
how
easy
this
was
to
put
down
one
of
the
best
english
bws
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
taste
if
you
have
a
bottle
from
or
around
2007
its
on
d
pretty
incredible
for
its
weight
hate
to
think
what
this
one
was
like
fresh
more
like
a
barrel
aged
iipa
3
5
d
not
a
bad
brew
but
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
apparent
in
the
taste
and
it
then
becomes
downright
militant
in
the
aftertaste
i
wonder
if
aging
this
a
few
years
to
calm
that
down
not
as
much
complexity
as
i
thought
there
would
be
but
theres
no
denying
the
craftsmanship
of
this
barleywine
d
im
liking
it
not
loving
it
horribly
overpriced
to
me
id
rather
buy
3
old
guardians
instead
better
thank
gn0sis
for
sending
this
bottle
to
me
in
an
awesome
trade
d
a
nice
tasting
beer
but
a
sipper
perhaps
its
drinkability
will
improve
with
more
age
the
beer
pours
a
reddishamber
color
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
the
aroma
is
much
hoppier
than
expected
with
citrus
hops
brown
sugar
and
sweet
malt
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
the
beer
tastes
like
oranges
covered
in
a
brown
sugar
glaze
the
hop
flavor
is
high
but
the
bitterness
is
pretty
low
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
im
not
always
the
biggest
barleywine
fan
but
alesmith
has
a
proven
winner
with
old
numbskull
i
especially
enjoy
it
fresh
but
with
some
age
or
from
a
barrel
its
delicious
as
well
great
beer
superb
barleywine
very
balanced
and
flavorful
with
subtle
english
qualities
very
nice
nevertheless
the
alcohol
heat
provides
a
warming
mouthfeel
on
the
tongue
and
back
of
the
throat
where
the
heat
lingers
briefly
despite
the
flavor
profile
being
relatively
simple
it
is
executed
quite
skillfully
a
very
enjoyable
high
ranking
barleywine
drinkability
one
of
the
best
and
most
complex
barleywines
i
have
had
the
alcohol
really
hits
you
over
the
head
here
i
do
like
the
caramel
taste
but
really
just
a
wonderful
beer
a
sipper
though
notes
a
classic
barley
wine
from
alesmith
i
have
to
admit
that
i
find
barley
wines
to
be
a
bit
overbearing
this
is
a
pretty
classic
example
of
the
style
overall
that
just
does
everything
well
very
wellrounded
and
somewhat
drinkable
despite
the
abv
always
a
good
one
to
go
back
to
i
suggest
aging
it
for
a
few
years
overall
this
is
a
rather
boring
bw
it
doesnt
have
the
sweetness
or
balance
of
a
great
bw
i
would
skip
this
one
d
wow
i
dont
know
if
i
could
handle
this
lol
i
was
on
an
empty
stomach
when
i
started
and
felt
a
nice
buzz
ate
something
continued
and
still
feeling
a
good
buzz
the
beer
poured
from
the
galss
to
reveal
a
nice
copper
hue
with
a
rich
foamy
head
mild
lacing
and
legs
the
aroma
was
a
mix
of
apricot
pine
and
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
was
buttery
with
a
carbonation
feel
there
was
a
mild
fruity
and
apricot
taste
at
first
that
quickly
gave
way
to
the
taste
of
earthy
hops
and
an
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
smooth
drinkability
is
amazing
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
alcohol
flavor
isnt
harsh
pretty
much
non
existent
i
think
its
my
new
favorite
barleywine
di
really
like
this
big
flavors
and
well
balanced
i
love
hops
seems
a
little
more
american
west
coast
style
barleywine
but
im
not
going
to
split
hairs
2007
vintage
lots
of
english
malts
toffee
caramel
left
and
still
pretty
hot
after
3
years
very
good
all
in
all
this
will
be
a
great
brew
for
bas
that
enjoy
ipas
and
american
barleywines
i
feel
like
this
should
not
be
labeled
an
english
barleywine
but
should
instead
be
an
american
d
good
barleywine
example
draught
at
the
red
in
santa
cruz
deep
amber
with
a
lasting
creamy
head
candied
fruit
and
butterscotch
aroma
the
flavor
is
really
malty
with
caramel
vanilla
brown
sugar
and
some
berries
the
alcohol
flavor
is
clean
and
smooth
but
present
hops
balance
nicely
and
never
distract
too
much
from
the
rich
malts
very
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
overall
quite
smooth
and
full
but
missing
excitement
for
me
first
sip
near
the
recommended
50f
is
boozy
bliss
english
toffee
caramel
syrup
and
dried
fruits
hold
down
the
sweet
side
of
the
palate
while
the
hops
add
a
distinctly
american
bitter
resinous
balance
to
the
top
and
sides
of
the
palate
the
finish
is
equal
parts
bubbly
and
boozy
with
a
pronounced
warming
from
the
alcohol
body
is
mediumthick
and
a
bit
overcarbonated
at
first
but
becomes
more
manageable
as
the
drink
progresses
all
in
all
a
delicious
interpretation
of
the
english
barleywine
style
as
alesmith
rarely
disappoints
i
almost
wish
i
would
have
given
this
a
few
more
months
in
the
cellar
but
old
numbskull
is
still
amazing
fresh
this
is
full
in
body
with
mild
carbonation
and
then
a
syrupy
middle
old
numbskull
ends
on
a
warming
alcohol
note
overall
a
good
attempt
at
an
english
barleywine
just
not
up
to
snuff
when
compared
to
other
beers
in
this
style
still
a
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
have
access
to
on
a
daily
basis
a
fantastic
barleywine
and
fits
the
style
very
well
even
fresh
i
will
certainly
get
1
or
2
more
for
aging
mouthfeeldrinkability
mouthfeel
is
near
full
bodied
and
fairly
slick
the
carbonation
stays
relatively
light
in
the
drink
keeping
this
one
fairly
smooth
the
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
taking
aa
good
hit
due
to
the
alcohol
presence
not
very
good
which
is
odd
i
was
expecting
to
really
enjoy
this
may
be
time
to
lay
off
the
barleywines
for
a
while
cant
finish
this
one
great
mouthfeel
nice
and
thick
oily
from
the
hops
and
carbonated
so
as
to
make
it
perfectly
smooth
drinkability
is
great
as
well
keeps
you
reaching
for
more
now
i
wish
id
gotten
more
of
this
when
i
had
the
chance
the
body
is
big
but
clean
some
yeast
character
but
overall
smooth
a
touch
of
heat
but
should
age
very
nicely
a
very
nice
barleywine
to
me
though
this
is
more
on
par
with
an
american
bwine
but
overall
very
very
good
d
a
nice
sipper
that
improves
a
lot
as
it
warms
up
but
still
a
little
too
much
alcohol
d
super
easy
drinking
probably
too
drinkable
for
the
abv
so
smooth
all
around
so
smooth
in
fact
that
nothing
really
pops
out

750ml
bottle
capped

glass
also
courtesy

poured
a
translucent
mahogany
with
a
rocky
two
inch
beigecolored
cap
head
eventually
settles
into
a
frothy
solid
quarter
inch
skim
with
some
residual

revealed

the
tasting
complex
and
intense
nose
grapefruit
citrus
caramel
malt
brown
sugar
and
molasses
consistent
with

but
also
a
little
peppery
some
dark

perhaps
prunes
or
figs
with
a
little
residual
booziness
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
quite
bright
and
lively
with
a
mild
burn
at
the
back
of
the
throat
typically
not
a
style
i
seek
out
however
this
is
delicious
while
there
is
definitely
an
alcohol
presence
i
have
to
say
that
it
is
not
suggestive
of
an
11
abv
an
exceptional
beer
i
have
to
say
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
an
enormous
head
with
that
slowly
faded
to
a
heavy
skin
the
aroma
was
hop
citrus
with
a
alcohol
kicker
and
malt
bring
up
the
rear
the
taste
was
just
opposite
of
the
aroma
toffee
sweetness
in
front
but
a
refreshing
bitter
aftertaste
the
alcohol
did
not
loom
large
in
the
flavor
feel
was
about
medium
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
but
this
is
an
11
00
abv
so
keep
your
wits
about
you
a
foil
wrapped
and
capped
750ml
bottle
split
with
psycohops
and
poured
into
a
pair
of
shaker
glasses
the
barleywine
appears
a
cloudy
crimson
brown
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
dense
tan
colored
foam
aromas
and
flavors
consist
of
lots
of
caramel
brown
sugar
hints
of
citrus
such
as
tangerine
dates
raisins
falls
between
medium
and
full
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
noticeable
alcohol
heat
throughout
went
really
well
with
some
sharp
cheddar
d
just
about
what
i
expect
from
the
style
though
the
lower
amount
of
sweetness
than
the
typical
english
barleywine
raises
the
drinkability
a
bit
in
my
book
definitely
a
sipper
d
not
knowing
the
age
of
the
bottle
i
would
say
this
is
not
extremely
fresh
as
i
did
not
get
a
hop
bomb
like
some
other
reviews
what
i
did
get
was
a
delicious
and
great
balanced
barleywine
that
i
would
not
mind
having
another
bottle
i
would
love
to
try
it
fresh
because
i
am
a
hophead
but
for
anyone
with
the
patience
to
age
this
beer
it
becomes
a
truly
wonderful
smooth
malty
treat
nah
raresizeytap
surprisingly
drinkable
nice
balance
and
a
fantastic
mouthfeel
made
this
a
perfect
match
with
some
nutty
butterysweet
midnight
moon
cheese
d
good
a
little
bit
more
of
the
11
alcohol
comes
through
at
the
warmer
temperature
but
i
still
wanted
to
drink
another
glass
after
the
first
an
interesting
mix
of
powerful
alcohol
heavy
malt
and
strong
hop
thick
almost
oily
mouthfeel
decent
carbonation
spicy
finish
from
the
hop
but
the
aftertaste
has
a
powerful
alcohol
component
this
is
a
pleasant
but
a
strong
beer
i
only
notice
the
strength
in
the
swallow
easy
to
enjoy
easy
to
overindulge
the
drinkability
on
this
brew
is
what
you
would
expect
from
a
barleywine
its
a
high
octane
slow
sipper
its
still
a
very
well
crafted
and
tasty
beer
but
it
took
me
a
very
long
time
to
polish
off
the
750
ml
it
was
bottled
in
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
i
plan
on
buying
another
one
and
adding
it
to
the
collection
for
it
to
age
like
most
barelywines
i
would
expect
this
to
be
much
better
if
i
gave
it
at
least
a
year
if
not
two
blipped
something
is
squeezing
my
skull
by
morrissey
have
had
bottles
before
all
great
this
note
is
from
draft
at
the
brewery
from
a
super
fresh
batch
hop
bomb
wow
totally
not
what
i
expected
the
beer
was
so
fresh
it
was
extremely
green
pine
hoppy
very
interesting
guessing
bottles
were
still
fermenting
and
carbinating
from
this
batch
it
was
so
new
very
refreshing
and
super
easy
to
drink
10
beer
fun
to
try
but
i
prefer
bottles
of
this
and
with
a
year
or
more
of
age
they
get
better
and
better

this
one
may
change
my

without
losing
its
barleywine
soul
and
smooth
and
silky
mouthfeel
this
is
at
the

of
the

ive
had

hoppy
strong
alcoholy
taste
strong
way
too
alcoholy
as
it
warms
d
very
drinkable
all
round
great
barleywine
ill
take
a
glass
anyday
this
poured
a
hazy
mahogany
with
some
tan
head
it
smelled
like
rich
caramel
and
orange
with
some
resin
and
mild
yeast
it
tasted
like
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
with
some
bitter
orange
peel
and
bready
yeast
and
a
bit
of
dry
resin
and
alcohol
it
was
somewhat
thick
with
mild
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
very
strong
and
delicious
flavor
with
great
body
it
had
big
hops
and
noticeable
alcohol
which
made
this
more
of
a
sipping
beer
fresh
if
aged
the
hops
would
fade
and
hopefully
the
alcohol
would
mellow
out
too
combine
that
with
the
strong
toffee
malt
backbone
and
this
beer
has
tons
of
potential
another
succulent
alesmith
beer
which
could
be
nearly
unbeatable
if
it
ages
like
i
think
it
will
d
a
real
nice
barleywine
here
that
is
not
over
the
top
with
hops
i
think
this
would
age
really
nicely
allowing
the
englishtype
malt
to
show
its
stuff
another
winner
from
san
diego
an
easy
sipper
drinkablity
as
a
beer
is
good
for
a
barleywine
its
fantastic
d
enjoyable
barleywine

bitterness
never
overplays
here
as
durge
stated
a
tasty
barleywine
indeed
sediment
made
me
feel
like
i
was
drinking
a
wine
with
silt
more
than
a
beer
my
barleywine
of
choice
from
the
warwick
gathering
brought
this
home
from
a
visit
to
san
diego
last
fall
and
finally
got
to
it
last
night
at
the
well
chronicled
warwick
drinking
society
session
hosted
by
ohoove
last
night
this
one
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
lots
of
floaties
and
a
decent
oatmeal
colored
head
and
nice
big
clumps
of
lace
the
aroma
is
incredible
with
butterscotch
malt
buttery
smooth
and
vanilla
beauty
awesome
the
flavor
isnt
quite
as
awesome
as
the
aroma
but
it
is
still
great
with
a
viscous
feel
buttery
malt
and
vanilla
plenty
of
herbal
hops
bouncing
around
here
nice
body
with
even
carbonation
that
makes
this
reasonably
drinkable
for
the
style
not
as
robust
as
some
but
quite
enjoyable
to
my
tastes
and
a
very
solid
barleywine
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
barleywine
its
big
and
bold
but
delicious
enough
to
keep
sipping

followed

i
expected

really
cuts
into
the
malt
sweetness
actually
this
is
a
very
dry
barleywine
a
little
hot
in
the
finish
between
the
booze
and
the
tremendous
hop
presence
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
a
top
shelf
barleywine
really
a
great
brew
one
ill
need
to
compare
to
a
more
recent
version
though
i
cant
argue
with
this
aging
notes
damn
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
still
pretty
good
but
its
just
way
too
sweet
and
alcoholic
to
be
great
i
wish
the
hop
bill
was
substantially
increased
to
take
the
edge
off
of
the
sweetness
and
aid
in
the
masking
of
the
alcohol
no
idea
how
old
this
bottle
is
but
im
thinking
it
may
have
a
year
on
it
at
least
maybe
when
its
fresh
the
hops
would
be
much
more
effective
overall
im
disappointed
with
this
overly
sweet
malt
bomb
that
i
had
high
hopes
for

chewy
body
great
nightcap
beer
d
sip
this
one
slowly
and
enjoy
given
the
ratings
this
bottle
must
be
transitioning
between
good
ages
for
sampling
because
this
is
just
a
step
up
from

legendary
d
very
drinkable
for
a
heavy
beer
i
received
this
bottle
in
a
trade
a
year
or
two
ago
i
forgot
that
i
had
this
in
my
stash
so
i
figured
that
2009
should
be
brought
in
properly
with
a
properly
aged
barleywine
i
believe
this
is
a
2004
or
2005
bottle
so
were
looking
at
around
4
or
5
years
of
aging
this
is
a
delicious
beer
malty
chocolately
and
fruity
everything
is
here
and
balance
is
the
name
of
the
game
there
is
not
much
in
the
way
of
overwhelming
flavors
here
what
you
have
is
an
easy
drinking
barleywine
that
has
aged
incredibly
well
id
be
very
interested
to
try
a
fresh
one
to
compare
the
differences
i
guess
that
means
a
trip
to

is
needed

i
love
this
barley
wine
d
for
the
abv
its
not
boozy
at
all
i
was
impressed
that
after
a
year
this
beer
was
still
so
hoppy
overall
a
really
unique
take
on
the
style
but
a
very
good
beer
great
beer
a
little
tricky
to
pour
at
first
was
hard
to
keep
the
yeast
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
my
fault
i
was
a
little
too
excited
to
try
this
beer
strong
taste
alcoholic
with
nice
mix
of
flavor
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
will
definitely
buy
again
i
would
like
to
age
one
for
a
year
and
see
the
difference
copper
color
with
medium
tan
head
powerful
nose
and
obvious
alcohol
carmel
sweet
with
lots
of
hop
pop
a
multitude
of
other
subtle
flavors
makes
this
something
very
unique
good
mouthfeel
costs
a
fortune
but
worth
the
price
super
brew
wish
it
was
not
so
hard
to
get
up
my
way
this
is

the

i
really
enjoy
the

the

have
rolled
over

really
starts
to
turn
into

the
flavor
is
nice
though
not
as
aggressive
as
i
had
hoped
still
its
a
solid
barleywine
and
im
diggin
it
another
great

offering
imo
pours
a

dark

in

a
very
short
lived
head
forms
on
the

and
is
gone
quickly
smell
is
malty
and
alcohol
but
to
my
chagrin
a
large
amount
of
hops
as
well
the
hops
are
too
prominent
in
the
flavor
i
was
hoping
for
a
low
hopped
english
barleywine
which
i
prefer
the
hops
are
just
too
much
to
get
past
to
focus
on
the
rest
of
the
beer
my
least
favorite
beer
from
an
otherwise
standout
brewery
d
hell
yes
and
more
please
i
think
this
is
excellent
and
even
though
this
should
be
sipped
its
hard
not
to
just
drink
it
humongous
ale
all
the
way
around
this
is
a
beer
to
be
respected
and
drank
slowly
every
sip
is
a
gem
and
even
if
this
isnt
my
absolute
favorite
barleywine
and
the
price
tag
really
hurts
me
this
is
an
ale
i
would
like
to
get
to
know
better
simply
incredible
the
best
barleywine
i
have
ever
tasted
11
you
cannot
even
tell
so
smooth
and
tasty
youd
think
it
was
a
regular
beer
the
aroma
had
a
nice
hoppiness
to
it
which
was
flowery
spicy
with
some
caramel
in
the
background
the
taste
was
rich
and
spicy
it
was
real
smooth
and
balanced
not
too
hoppy
not
to
malty
the
abv
was
well
hidden
and
it
was
smooth
and
creamy
and
delicious
it
was
well
malted
and
a
very
enjoyable
brew
overall
i
thought
this
was
solid
though
i
liked
the
ba
version
much
better
but
can
you
really
blame
me
i
would
defintly
get
this
one
again
though
as
it
was
very
well
done
and
a
very
solid
beer
overall
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
would
have
liked
it
to
have
a
bit
more
carbonation
so
that
the
mouthfeel
would
have
been
somewhat
lighter
but
still
this
is
not
out
of
style
i
like
the
flavor
and
overall
balance
and
presentation
so
i
would
certainly
like
to
try
this
one
again
i
am
a
little
weird
in
that
i
dont
really
like
fresh
barleywine
and
this
one
at
2
years
old
is
pretty
much
in
its
prime
again
i
would
like
a
tad
more
fizz
but
still
its
not
bad
at
all
overall
homer
simpson

like
this

its
very

good
just
make
sure
you
put

on
this
before
you
give

this

the
taste

at
first
with
a
firey
finish
mellowed
hops
are
a
nice
taste
the

shows

the
mellowness
makes
this
brew
quite
drinkable

this
brew
would
certainly
age

tastes

this

d
i
love
english
barleywines
and
this
one
is
no
exception
d
for
11
this
is
extremely
drinkable
i
am
not
sure
why
this
isnt
the
standard
for
barleywines
since
it
is
absolutely
amazing
i
always
like
bws
but
this
just
made
me
love
them
drinkability
a
delightful
barleywine
fresh
you
certainly
cant
say
that
about
all
of
them
and
one
that
i
suspect
ages
quite
wonderfully
d
fairly
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
the
alcohol
is
readily
apparent
but
not
unpleasant
the
hop
character
is
the
dominant
flavor
here
but
it
is
kept
in
check
by
the
huge
malt
presence
an
interesting
and
distinctly
american
take
on
a
classic
english
style
note
need
to
purchase
a
case
for
aging
pours

nice
brownish
color
not
much
carbonation
not
much

is

nice
tones
of
dark
fruitspices
with
some
caramel
notes
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
at
first
then
the
malts
come
into
plan
the
alcohol
is
pretty
present
on
this
one
medium
body
very
drinkable
tough
worth
a
seek
d
a
very
solid
and
slightly
hopped
up
representation
of
an
english
bw
i
would
certainly
seek
this
out
again
poured
a
nice
dark
orange
color
with
an
offwhite
thin
head
smell
was
a
malt
soup
for
me
with
some
earthy
hops
thrown
in
the
taste
was
a
soup
of
big
sticky
sweetness
alcohol
and
then
cleaned
out
with
some
earthy
hops
i
thought
this
was
ok
but
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
i
prefer
the
barleywine
style
that
bigfoot
and
old
guardian
hit
this
was
a
little
to
soupy
syrupy
for
me
but
wasnt
undrinkable
overalli
really
enjoyed
this
i
recommend
aging
it
just
for
fun
but
doesnt
really
need
to
change
if
the
alcohol
were
brought
down
a
notch
or
two
this
would
be
a
more
approachable
drinkable
barleywine
as
is
its
a
delicious
if
unsubtle
beast
perfect
for
sharing
if
youre
tackling
this
huge
bottle
alone
you
better
have
a
long
lazy
day
ahead
of
you
d
pretty
solid
beer

glass
pours
a
beautiful
brownish

color
with

nice

the
aroma
is
absolutely
mouthwatering
the
aroma
features
a
huge
malty
aroma
with
lots
of
caramel
toffee
and
hops
the
taste
starts
out
unbelievably
smooth
and
malty
with
the
hops
making
their
presence
in
the
finish
alongside
a
warming
sensation
from
the
high
abv
despite
the
high
abv
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
a
sipper
for
sure
overall
i
am
completely
blown
away
with
this
beer
it
is
the
best
barleywine
i
have
tried
highly
recommended
overall
a
wonderful
english
style
barleywine
though
i
think
i
like
the
hoppiness
in
the
american
style
a
bit
better
i
do
really
like
this
one
though
and
in
my
opinion
alesmith
at
this
point
can
do
no
wrong
try
it
you
will
be
glad
you
did
cheers
i
like
this
bwsa
and
i
can
see
why
its
listed
as
an
english
style
because
of
how
the
malt
character
plays
center
stage
id
drink
it
again
no
problem
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
12
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
rich
and
warm
burnt
toffee
scent
thats
out
of
this
world
its
a
beautiful
thing
the
taste
is
excellent
it
has
a
very
complex
taste
that
boasts
of
warm
malty
flavors
and
powerful
hoppy
notes
it
goes
down
slow
and
smooth
with
a
warm
dry
finish
this
is
a
very
tastey
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
beer
certainly
lived
up
to
my
expectations
its
one
of
the
better
barleywines
on
the
market
highly
recommended
bought
this
bottle
in
december
in
portland
pours
a
nice
reddish
dark
amber
with
a
very
nice
head
that
fades
to
a
thick
cap
and
leaves
some
clumpy
lacing
good
head
for
such
a
strong
nonbelgian
beer
somewhat
sweet
and
malty
but
not
overly
so
in
the
aroma
this
is
well
balanced
with
some
nice
citrusy
hops
and
some
spicebox
scents
very
nice
english
in
aroma
with
a
tad
more
hops
than
usual
without
straying
over
into
dipa
terrritory
at
all
the
taste
is
also
wonderful
with
more
of
that
sweet
maltiness
restrained
in
its
sugariness
some
more
citrusy
hops
and
faint
spiceiness
that
complements
rather
than
dominates
a
beautiful
example
of
the
style
perhaps
a
bit
less
sweet
slightly
more
hoppy
and
slightly
more
robust
than
english
examples
mellow
mouthfeel
waxy
and
a
bit
creamy
and
full
without
being
harsh
astonishing
that
this
is
11
abv
it
doesnt
taste
like
it
how
pleasant
im
always
a
fan
of
alesmiths
stuff
pours
without
a
head
so
no
lace
thought
it
might
be
flat
but
it
isnt
nose
is
mellow
caramel
cloudy
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
flavor
is
caramel
but
it
is
sweet
and
sour
some
alcohol
clean
finish

for
a
750ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
alesmith
has
yet
to
do
wrong
that
i
have
tasted
thanks
again
john
this
poured
with
only
a
minor
lighttan
head
it
was
slightly
hazy
and
mediumamber
in
color
it
had
a
great
malty
nose
accompanied
by
a
nice
alcohol
scent
mouthfeel
was
medium
but
it
had
a
very
spicy
aspect
to
it
on
the
tongue
prevalently
pepper
but
more
complex
than
that
the
finish
was
explosive
with
the
heat
and
the
spiciness
going
right
up
the
ol
chimney
pipe
and
into
the
sinuses
it
made
my
eyes
water
and
then
i
sensed
the
tannins
beginning
to
take
over
it
had
a
lovely
lingering
taste
of
buttery
toffee
no
doubt
that
this
was
an
englishstyle
barleywine
way
pale
light
amber
in
color
with
a
tiny
head
smells
so
strong
smells
so
bitter
maybe
a
bit
of
caramel
and
other
malts
but
a
lot
of
citrus
and
grassy
hop
smell
to
it
too
tastes
pretty
close
to
a
barleywine
darn
it
all
not
like
that
other
crap
weve
been
drinking
says
swmbo
ah
interesting
listed
here
now
as
an
english
bwine
well
weird
its
way
too
bitter
for
one
of
those
of
course
its
not
bitter
enough
for
a
merican
bwine
so
how
do
you
rate
it
arg
i
say
arg
ill
call
it
merican
and
say
that
its
lacking
in
bitterness
for
an
english
its
fricking
amazing
except
that
its
way
too
bitter
oh
the
traumas
right
its
too
bitter
and
too
light
at
least
theres
enough
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
you
know
what
i
mean
drinkability
good
solid
barleywine
i
definately
prefer
weyerbacher
insanity
to
this
though
d
there
is
some
nice
complexity
in
the
malt
which
is
followed
buy
a
big
monster
hop
flavor
so
although
the
hops
are
the
biggest
flavor
the
malt
complexity
really
adds
to
this
beer
d
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
traditional
barleywine
w
plenty
of
english
malt
traits
and
sufficient
abv
to
make
it
a
satisfyingly
drinkable
brew
this
is
one
id
like
to
always
have
on
hand
drinkability
is
excellent
too
perfectly
balanced
even
my
coors
light
drinking
fatherinlaw
liked
it
and
commented
on
how
well
balanced
it
is
one
of
the
benchmark
beers
for
the
style
balanced
and
complex
enough
to
keep
you
going
back
for
more
a
big
beer
and
yet
the
full
750ml
bottle
went
down
with
no
trouble
and
i
was
still
wishing
for
another
i
really
just
need
to
get
a
case
of
this
one
in
my
cellar
hello
2008
and
another
year
of
great
beer
drinking
definitely
going
to
pull
out
some
amazing
beers
from
my
cellar
this
coming
year
hope
everybody
had
an
enjoyable
holiday
pours
a
deep
amber
redbrown
mostly
brown
good
off
white
head
with
good
lace
nose
is
of
mad
hops
and
clean
malts
some
malt
and
dark
sugar
as
well
taste
is
a
wonderful
balance
of
hop
and
malt
the
malt
flavors
come
first
with
dark
fruitdate
and
some
raisin
through
the
middle
the
sugars
and
hops
creep
up
slowly
the
hops
become
more
intense
as
the
sugar
fades
a
good
crisp
hoppy
finish
sugar
and
hop
bitterness
linger
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
thin
but
overrall
its
refreshingly
smooth
for
a
bw
drinkability
is
dangerously
high
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
barleywine
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
malt
and
a
little
less
hop
flavor
for
an
english
style
but
overall
it
is
quite
good
the
2003
in
my
cellar
is
laughing
at
me
and
begging
me
to
open
it
like
a
serpent
in
the
garden
drinkability
is
rather
high
as
this
is
a
fantastic
bw
served
at
cellar
temp
good
thing
theres
a
few
more
in
there
alesmith
cant
go
wrong
i
had
this
during
a
massive
bw
tasting
thx
samuraiartist
and
now
a
full
bottle
to
myself
is
barely
enough
drinks
a
bit
slow
despite
all
the
goodness
a
very
nice
american
imo
style
bw
their
abw
might
just
rip
your
lips
off
my
favorite
cali
brewery
now
stellar
offering
d
thanks
to
tayner
for
this
one
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
the
score
would
indicate
i
just
could
not
find
many
barleywine
characteristics
here
drinkability
the
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
an
instance
when
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
the
mouthfeel
and
scent
and
flavor
tie
together
to
make
one
delicious
beer
it
is
much
easier
to
drink
than
a
lot
of
other
barleywines
i
have
consumed
this
is
a
beer
i
would
regularly
search
out
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
until
then
i
am
content
to
order
it
online
as
a
special
treat
split
with
a
friend
and
poured
into
brooklyn
goblets
poured
a
seductive
brownishred
with
one
finger
tan
head
quite
opaque
with
tiny
bubbles
in
the
head
huge
hop
notes
followed
by
a
nice
backing
of
caramel
megasyrupy
in
the
mouth
as
one
would
expect
from
a
11
barleywine
unbelievably
smooth
for
such
a
big
beer
hop
kicker
the
whole
way
pours
a
hazy
red
hued
dark
amber
orange
color
with
an
innocent
layer
of
eggshell
colored
bubbles
that
disperse
quickly
limited
lacing
observed
the
smell
is
a
thick
rich
malt
over
a
nice
hop
and
alcohol
fibre
that
involuntarily
cautions
the
user
to
dispense
a
meager
portion
for
consideration
lightly
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
heavy
but
notably
shy
of
being
syrupy
full
flavored
the
honey
caramel
vanilla
taste
is
complemented
by
its
smooth
texture
the
11
0
abv
is
not
bashful
nor
overbearing
very
smooth
and
without
any
burning
effect
a
really
nice
warmer
recommend
enjoying
this
one
when
you
can
take
it
down
a
notch
i
think
this
one
has
jst
gone
past
its
peak
or
possibly
is
in
a
rut
and
more
age
would
bring
it
back
d
crazy
huge
beer
explosive
flavor
with
major
complexity
this
one
could
cellar
for
years
to
come
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
dark
amber
color
with
almost
no
head
very
slight
lacing
aroma
of
alcohol
caramel
and
maybe
a
hint
of
fruit
nice
full
mouthfeel
flavor
is
very
potent
with
alcohol
almost
bourbonlike
finish
is
hoppy
with
more
of
a
yeast
and
bourbon
flavor
to
it
very
nice
barleywine
much
more
hoppy
than
anticipated
full
of
floral
piney
hops
with
a
hint
of
citrus
totally
american
in
style
with
some
residual
sugar
on
the
finish
but
i
think
there
is
much
more
rs
than
the
hops
are
letting
me
believe
a
candied
nutty
character
with
more
of
a
dried
fig
and
date
approach
in
the
mouth
maple
with
less
brown
sugar
than
the
nose
would
indicate
very
toffee
and
caramel
driven
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
that
leaves
a
long
thick
resiny
finish
i
think
this
would
be
more
to
my
liking
and
much
higher
scoring
with
a
years
age
on
it
however
fresh
as
this
one
is
its
a
damn
fine
beer
score
one
for
alesmith
pours
a
dark
ruby
reddish
hue
with
a
1
inch
head
comprised
of
tiny
bubbles
the
foam
steadily
recedes
leaving
beautiful
sticky
lacing
in
its
wake
the
aroma
consists
of
equally
big
hop
and
malt
characteristics
very
pungent
and
inviting
grapefruit
pineapple
papaya
caramel
butterscotch
yeast
dates
grapes
and
fig
are
all
perceived
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
excellent
malts
come
through
first
with
a
light
sweetness
and
luscious
flavor
and
the
hops
come
through
strong
toward
the
middle
and
end
there
is
a
pleasant
lingering
bitterness
that
leaves
you
salivating
and
reaching
for
another
sip
the
alcohol
is
a
nonfactor
as
far
as
the
tongue
is
concerned
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
probably
my
favorite
barleywine
to
date
a
superlative
beer
d
good
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
this
one
lacks
any
real
character
nice
to
try
but
i
probably
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
alesmith
is
becoming
a
new
favorite
brewery
of
mine
recommended
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
i
split
it
with
a
friend
a
great
barleywine
and
i
will
be
picking
up
another
as
soon
as
i
get
the
chance
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
have
this
one
i
dont
think
barleywines
are
my
favorite
beers
but
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
one
wow
what
a
great
tasting
brew
i
love
barleywines
of
all
types
and
this
one
is
a
hopheads
best
friend
the
pour
was
bubbly
and
deep
dark
amber
with
some
sweet
molasses
malts
and
citrusy
hop
aromas
the
taste
was
complex
defined
brown
sugars
ripe
cherries
round
out
the
sweetness
while
the
resinous
hops
hit
the
tongue
with
a
grapefruit
hopbomb
the
sweet
burning
from
the
alcohol
is
evident
but
not
distracting
whatsoever
the
finish
is
dry
and
despite
the
oily
hop
flavor
stays
that
way
great
hop
flavors
and
the
brew
is
light
even
though
the
flavors
are
so
thick
i
finished
one
bottle
myself
in
about
45
mins
there
should
be
a
warning
on
beers
that
taste
this
good
sort
of
a
clashingpersonality
of
a
beer
big
unrepentantly
so
but
not
necessarily
worth
its
weight
in
beerdollars
for
me
the
ultimate
bw
test
is
is
it
almost
as
good
as
bigfoot
for
almost
as
cheap
thats
a
hard
prospect
to
come
out
victorious
from
a
great
barley
wine
strong
in
flavor
very
thick
malts
but
not
an
overwhelming
bitterness
like
some
barley
wines
appereance
is
exceptional
smell
is
very
strong
as
well
there
is
a
very
nice
caramel
malting
that
is
very
thick
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
lacks
crispness
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
for
a
barley
wine
you
should
give
it
a
try
definitely
recommended
stock
up
and
cellar
this
as
it
should
be
good
for
years
after
the
release
seek
this
beer
out
beer
poured
a
deep
brown
almost
black
cloudy
body
with
a
slight
tan
head
into
my
tulip
glass
there
was
a
pronouced
aroma
of
roasted
malt
and
milk
chocolate
the
taste
was
more
of
the
same
and
more
there
was
a
strong
roasted
malt
chocolate
presence
along
with
some
very
nice
vineous
and
plum
tastes
that
gave
this
beer
even
more
depth
than
expected
the
body
is
full
and
the
mouthfeel
is
as
well
but
this
is
a
very
enjoyable

with

stronger
in
the

than
it
was
in
the

big
rich
sugary

is
nice
and
soft
and
creamy
it
is
cut
by
a
small
bite
of

at
the

of
the
throat
as
well
as
some
piney

towards
the
finish

a
nice

finish
outstanding
barleywine
this
bottle
is
about
one
year
old
but
could
easily
age
longer
this
is
a
great
barley
wine
i
tasted
it
against
stones
old
guardian
and
this
was
clearly
the
better
even
if
they
are
slightly
different
styles
it
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
reddish
amber
with
a
relatively
thin
off
white
to
tan
head
the
smell
is
very
aromatic
malty
with
alcohol
and
a
hint
of

the
taste
has
an
excellent
balance
with
lightly
sweet

drinkable
for
this

probably
the
best
bw
i
have
had
personally
this
is
one
of
the
best
barley
wines
that
i
have
ever
tasted
this
beer
pours

with

rich
maltfor

the
alchohol
is
not
overpowering
and
is
balanced
with
the
hopsthis
balance
and
the
11
give
this
beer
a
thick
and
chewy
mouthfeel
for
a
bw
this
beer
from
alesmith
is
exceptional
in
its
drinkability
i
wish
i
hadnt
split
my
bottlejust
kidding
poured

sip
and
look
through
the
bottom
of

glass
not
much
head
at
all
just
a
slight
ring
around
the
edge
aroma
is
not
strong
but
is
pleasantly
malty
and
hoppy
as
well
now
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
adequatly
carbonated
up

thick
in

this
is
a
well
constructed
beer
not

as
other
barleywines
this
one
has
plenty

the

and
the
hops
are
evenly

i
were
wise

vintage
almsot
a
year
since
i
purchased
it
hoppy
and
delicious
cheers
i
actually
finished
this
glass
with
ease
although
it
might
not
be
a
good
idea
to
have
more
than
one
its
too
strong
for
my
tastes
and
i
think
thats
why
i
waited
to
try
this
on
tap
rather
that
drop
12
bucks
fro
750ml
of
it
i
would
recommend
trying
it
d
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
for
10
abv
as
noted
alesmith
is
one
of
my
favorite
american
craft
breweries
and
is
a
permanent
fixture
in
my
top10
as
a
result
my
expectations
for
old
numbskull
were
stratospheric
in
the
final
reckoning
it
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
but
its
still
good
beer
and
should
warm
me
nicely
well
into
the
night
im
guessing
that
ill
sleep
like
a
baby
too
one
of
the
best
balanced
west
coast
barley
wines
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
sample
it
pours
a
hazy
dull
brown
with
virtually
no
head
aroma
is
light
hops
with
a
significant
caramel
malt
presece
taste
is
also
a
lot
of
caramel
malt
with
a
good
amount
winey
oakiness
this
beer
hides
its
11
abv
extremely
well
mouthfeel
is
fairly
sophisticated
and
complex
better
than
most
champaigns
ive
had
this
is
the
most
drinkable
barley
wine
ive
ever
had
drinkability
a
very
tasty
barley
wine
that
is
relatively
easy
to
consume
the
alcohol
is
a
warning
to
keep
this
at
a
slow
sipping
pace
its
very
bitter
for
an
english
bw
the
flavor
is
not
as
full
as
i
expected
and
the
hops
provide
a
numbing
bitterness
a
little
hot
in
the
finish
too
its
tasty
but
doesnt
cash
the
check

nice
brew
though
first
sip
reveals
a
syrupy
texture
and
average
body
with
very
gentle
carbonation
flavor
is
as
nose
advertises
with
sweet
fruit
pears
again
a
general
sugaryness
and
caramel
too
the
beer
moves
to
a
boozy
warm
alcohol
hit
on
the
finish
this
brew
is
a
definate
sipper
even
after
sitting
on
it
for
a
year
i
found
it
to
be
just
a
bit
too
hot
still
d
the
ale
is
big
and
bold
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
alesmith
the
high
abv
while
not
detectable
hurts
the
drinkability
but
the
ale
is
worth
a
look
anyway
this
strikes
me
as
more
of
an
american
barley
wine
based
solely
on
the
intensity
of
the
hops
drinkability
good
drinkabilityoverall
this
is
a
malty
beast
but
oh
so
smooth
rich
flavors
meld
well
together
quite
drinkable
for
10
d
i
enjoyed
this
but
it
was
most
certainly
a
sipping
beer
and
one
that
i
may
not
go
back
to
in
the
future
but
who
knows
maybe
i
just
didnt
get
an
outstanding
bottle
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
with
a
large
tan
foamy
head
the
smell
is
bisquity
with
dark
fruit
alcohol
and
some
hop
pine
the
taste
is
hoppy
with
dark
fruitalcoholbread
yeastand
a
fair
amount
of
malt
the
mf
is
heavy
with
all
flavors
mixing
well
a
very
good
barleywinebut
like
most
bws
its
not
too
drinkable
a
heavy
beer
with
a
heavy
feel
and
taste
a
definate
sipper
cheers
the
body
is
huge
one
of
the
thickest
beers
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
eating
the
residual
sugars
coat
the
palate
leaving
a
linger
bittersweet
finish
very
good
stuff
it
is
very
green
however
i
will
try
to
age
the
remaining
bottle
for
at
least
a
year
hopefully
two
a
little
pricey
for
what
it
is
but
a
dam
fine
brew
when
poured
into
my
glass
the
color
was
a
amber
with
an
orange
hue
and
no
foam
or
lace
as
usual
with
a
barleywine
style
beer
the
smell
was
of
a
sweetsourbitter
nature
with
the
nature
aroma
of
hops
filling
my
nose
the
taste
was
alot
like
the
aroma
sweebittersour
think
and
sort
of
creamy
in
the
mouth
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
tasted
but
pretty
damn
good
maybe
my
third
or
forth
favorite
d
very
good
nice
complex
brew
definitely
one
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
and
if
you
are
this
beer
would
just
be
amazing
d
a
good
barleywine
not
my
favorite
its
not
quite
sweet
enough
for
me
and
a
little
too
burntbitter
still
a
good
product
and
one
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
buy
again
2007
edit
damn
near
my
favorite
barleywine
buy
as
many
as
you
can
and
age
them
at
least
a
year
wonderful
creamy
goodness
cheers2beers
a
tasty
well
balanced
and
drinkable
english
style
barleywine
well
worth
a
pint
or
three
however
as
i
often
feel
the
10
for
alesmiths
750ml
26
2
oz
bottles
is
steep
especially
given
that
similarly
excellent
beers
can
be
had
for
5
and
even
less
for
22
ounces
i
like
the
beer
but
i
dislike
the
feeling
that
im
paying
for
fancy
marketing
bottles
and
foil
wrapping
i
might
buy
it
again
for
a
special
occasion
but
i
dont
and
wont
buy
it
regularly
cheers
overall
still
has
that
slap
of
old
numbskull
barleywine
but
i
expected
a
little
more
longevity
from
such
an
expensive
brew
that
markets
itself
alongside
other
high
end
brews
i
would
not
recommend
cellaring
the
old
numbskull
beyond
the
24
months
mentioned
in
the
6
to
24
months
or
longer
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
not
a
whole
lot
of
head
or
lacing
to
speak
of
but
the
sun
kissed
caramel
body
is
still
inviting
not
to
mention
the
massive
nose
that
makes
me
think
of
a
passionate
kiss
on
the
first
date
its
full
of
magnificent
caramel
bitter
grapefruit
hops
sherry
rum
and
raisins
if
i
could
i
would
buy
this
again
and
again
pure
pleasure
taste
reminds
me
of
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
with
the
hops
slightly
muted
this
isnt
a
bad
thing
as
it
gives
the
malt
a
chance
to
shine
in
all
the
taste
is
largely
the
same
as
the
nose
with
the
hops
being
far
more
understated
im
really
enjoying
this
mouth
is
lightly
carbonated
lending
a
velvet
feel
to
the
body
i
could
drink
lots
of
this
i
would
love
to
prepare
a
big
meal
and
serve
this
instead
of
dessert
a
fantastic
effort
at
a
barley
wine
this
beer
is
10
and
not
too
subtle
about
it
but
its
still
a
real
treat
going
to
finish
a
750ml
tonight
with
very
little
effort
its
a
very
good
thing
this
bottle
isnt
bigger
or
id
be
in
real
trouble
bottle
courtesy

hogtownharry
poured
a
clear
medium
brown
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
brown
head
with
minimal
retention
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
is
dominating
without
being
too
sweet
though
some
floral
hops
are
discernable
but
nothing
overwhelming
taste
is
also
dominated
by
sweet
malt
but
i
cant
find
any
complexity
of
dry
fruits
characteristics
that
i
usually
enjoy
some
hops
provide
a
slightly
bitter
finish
but
nothing
to
overshadow
the
rest
of
the
beer
body
is
defiantly
too
thin
and
watery
for
my
liking
and
alcohol
is
well
hidden
even
do
i
usually
enjoy
english
style
barleywine
i
cannot
say
that
i
was
overly
impressed
by
this
one
d
high
due
to
the
smoothness
but
lowered
due
to
the
abv
now
thats
a
true
american
barley
wine
big
on
everything
from
hops
to
barley
to
alcohol
to
richness
full
of
flavor
and
intimitating
from
beginning
to
end
big
barley
bready
hoppy
aromas
stare
down
over
a
dense
ruby
colored
brew
leaving
good
head
retention
and
lacing
evidence
of
great
proteins
overwhelming
flavors
of
barley
malt
taking
on
molassas
and
brown
sugar
proportions
intense
hop
flavor
casts
a
piney
citrus
shadow
on

the

well
aged

sweetened
beverage
alcohols
take
on
caugh
syrup
intensity
and
reach
a
light
solvent
evaporative
sensation
though
thick
and
heavy
on
the
palate
the
beer
finishes
a
balanced
sweet
bitter
ratio
as
great
as
it
is
i
often
have
problems
assigning
very
high
marks
to
the
extremelyhopped
barley
wines
alcohols
strength
also
keeps
me
from
scoring
higher
this
is
the
nonvintage
version
in
a
blue
bottle
with
foil
and
a
standard
cap
i
think
i
chilled
this
one
a
bit
too
long
poured
a
great
cloudy
orangeytan
into
a
chimay
glass
i
had
laying
around
had
a
lovely
if
shortlived
tan
head
with
some
moderate
lacing
initial
hit
on
the
nose
was
of
citrus
and
fruit
with
a
bit
of
pine
followed
by
some
complex
malts
and
a
dash
of
hops
the
piney
smell
was
was
carried
through
in
the
taste
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
some
up
front
hops
that
give
it
a
bitter
kick
as
i
sip
it
i
get
used
to
it
and
begin
to
notice
the
subtleties
of
its
taste
it
goes
down
slowly
but
not
unpleasantly
all
in
all
a
decent
brew
and
quite
a
lovely
barleywine
i
will
buy
another
bottle
and
try
aging
it
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
is
veryu
full
bodied
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
covered
up
the
residual
alcohol
shows
up
as
a
pleasing
spicyness
this
beer
has
a
pleasing
spicy
hoppy
and
malty
balance
this
is
just
a
excellent
drinking
beer
the
beer
was
empty
before
i
was
aware
of
it
this
one
is
a
looker
without
a
doubt
a
gentle
pour
produced
a
tan
head
that
was
more
than
sufficient
to
top
off
the
delicious
looking
honey
orange
liquid
that
lies
beneath
it
quite
clean
very
good
from
a
visual
standpoint
the
nose
lays
out
some
crusty
malt
dynamics
it
reeks
of
dirty
sugar
canelike
sweetness
with
some
toasty
and
frankly
burnt
aspects
it
has
a
roughness
to
it
that
gives
it
the
barley
wine
attitude
that
is
so
appealing
the
thing
is
raw
and
to
be
respected
alcohol
vapour
rips
through
at
times
in
true
wraith
fashion
the
taste
is
funky
old
sweetness
with
a
dryness
fueled
by
the
alcohol
scorched
caramel
and
apple
skins
in
a
sense
somewhat
chalky
this
barleywine
stays
decent
without
overstepping
its
malt
boundaries
into
a
cloying
demise
brash
but
accommodating
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
in
my
experience
the
lighter
and
less
intrusive
use
of
malt
lends
to
a
lighter
body
and
a
drinkability
that
flourishes
due
to
both
the
superb
taste
and
less
filling
nature
of
this
brew
well
tuned
not
an
abomination
wish
we
had
this
stuff
in
da
mit
id
love
to
lay
a
bottle
of
this
down
for
a
good
45
years
to
see
how
it
matures
as
it
is
its
certainly
a
barleywine
to
be
reckoned
with
and
one
well
worth
trying
drinkability
having
been
to
the
alesmith
brewery
i
understand
why
they
bottle
in
750
ml
bottles
however
that
is
a
barleywine
to
consume
and
i
wish
more
brewers
would
bottle
their
high
gravity
beers
in
12
oz
bottles
bottle
pours
a
light
brown
with
red
tints
has
almost
no
head
has
a
good
sweet
aroma
with
a
good
mix
of
hops
looks
sort
of
flat
with
a
slick
texture
has
a
bold
duration
and
a
good
strong
finish
a
nice
amount
of
bitterness
i
would
call
it
medium
bodied
a
very
smooth
drink
with
a
touch
of
dryness
very
complex
it
keeps
my
mind
jumping
and
changing
this
is
one
you
just
have
to
try
for
yourself
and
make
your
own
judgement
after
the
750
i
decided
i
liked
it
this
is
a
well
balanced
barleywine
the
hops
are
piney
and
citrus
flavored
the
malt
provides
a
nice
caramel
profile
with
some
cherrylike
fruit
flavors
mouthfeel
is
nice
heavy
without
being
syrupy
drinkability
is
good
but
given
the
size
of
the
bottle
the
richness
of
flavor
and
the
fact
that
i
cant
buy
it
in
in
ill
save
my
other
bottle
for
a
while
a
very
respectable
barleywine
one
to
seek
out
its
got
a
lot
to
offer
d
the
alcohol
is
so
integrated
and
the
hoppyness
is
so
balanced
this
has
to
be
the
perfect
barleywine
taste
was
deliciously
sippable
with
the
initial
impression
being
made
by
sweet
and
caramel
malt
until
the
citric
hop
oils
literally
took
over
finish
was
peppery
and
pungent
the
beer
felt
sticky
and
a
little
coarse
on
the
palette
which
was
undoubtedly
due
to
a
young
age
i
can
see
this
one
aging
quite
nicely
but
alas
i
only
bought
this
single
bomber
drinkability
was
good
despite
the
intensity
since
i
like
the
characteristics
it
possessed
not
the
epitome
of
the
style
but
a
very
good
example
from
the
bottle
poured
amber
with
a
light
tan
head
that
left
a
small
amount
of
lacing
aroma
alcohol
malts
orange
raisins
sweet
pineapple
and
other
tropic
fruits
honey
flavor
i
hope
it
taste
as
good
as
the
aroma
a
nice
blend
of
fruits
and
chocolate
the
alcohol
kind
of
takes
a
back
seat
honey
malts
a
nice
bitterness
and
dryness
glad
i
have
another
one
in
the
cellar
this
beer
poured
a
slightly
hazy
copper
to
amber
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
hints
of
sherry
vanilla
plumbs
and
a
touch
of
tangerine
on
the
finish
the
taste
is
sweet
and
smooth
a
mix
of
fine
sherry
and
brandy
layers
of
vanilla
black
cherry
plumbs
and
the
tangerine
i
sensed
in
the
nose
incredibly
complex
the
alcohol
heat
blends
well
with
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
full
smooth
mouth
feel
very
satisfying
and
surprisingly
drinkable
wonderful
beer
well
for
something
as
brash
as
this
beer
it
aint
sweet
but
thats
the
only
way
to
describe
the
combined
heaviness
and
easytodrinkness
of
the
flavors
its
reasonably
easy
to
drink
this
glass
of
beer
is
half
gone
and
my
head
is
spinning
cheerfully
i
give
it
an
above
average
score
cool
color
just
needs
a
head
and
with
the
amount
of
hops
they
must
have
used
in
this
one
i
guess
only
the
very
low
carbonation
is
to
blame
smell
is
great
but
the
taste
needs
major
reworking
scratch
the
overly
nutty
malts
and
the
harsh
treebark
hops
and
this
would
be
a
classic
as
it
stands
i
wont
be
buying
it
again

this
one
had
been
aging
for
just
short
of
a
year
when
i
finally
cracked
it
open
i
just
couldnt
wait
any
longer
it
decanted
a
mostly
clear
red
colour
with
fine
offwhite
head
this
reduced
to
a
thin
wisp
and
produced
excellent
lacing
throughout
superb
balance
of
aromas
with
some
toffee
evident
even
from
a
distance
caramel
and
tea
along
with
plenty
of
piney
hop
character
mild
alcohol
pulls
the
aromas
together
nicely
toffee
and
pine
become
stronger
as
it
warms
and
a
hint
of
fruitiness
creeps
in
as
well
caramel
and
toffee
kick
off
the
flavour
but
balanced
bitterness
comes
forward
as
the
sweetness
fades
in
the
dry
finish

cant

to
get
hold
of
another
bottle
pours
a
deep

color
near
brown
with
a
white
tight
sticky
head
that
is
gone
pretty
quickly
deep
vanilla
aromas
mixed
with
a
generous
hopped
piney
aroma
intermingled
nicely
wow
what
a
combination
of
sweet
caramel
and
alcohol
with
a
generous
amount
of
grassy
piney
drying

very
balanced
and
indredibly
flavorful
barley
wine
big
time
winner
here
i
wish
i
had
more
what
a
flavor
combination
with
a
big
alcohol
punch
a
little
harshness
in
the
mouthfeel
dept
kept
it
from
being
off

charts
this
beer
is

abv
i
can
feel
the
heat
before
the
beer
touches
my
lips
kind
of
permeates
its
way
up
the
nostrils
other
than
the
alcohol
there
is
at
first
a
subtle
sweetness
of
malts
followed
by
a
pungent
earthy
hoppiness
that
is
more
american
than
english
got
some
sickly
sweet
bornw
sugar
and
a
little
bit
of
sour
cranberries
too
mouthfeel
is
light
lots
of
bitter
puckiering
from
the
hops
and
even
more
burn
from
the
alcohol
tougher
beer
to
swallow
than
i
was
expecting
so
far
i
can
live
with
the
beers
presentation
but
the
taste
is
blaringly
harsh
in
its
alcoholic
temperament
and
the
finish
bites
like
a
red
ant
the
initial
outpouring
of
strawberryaccented
malts
is
hammered
by
the
aggressive
finish
while
the
body
feels
limp
and
anemic
at
its
best
moments
numbskull
is
suggestive
of
fruited
brandy
at
its
worst
its
simply
disappointing
even
after
retrieval
from
ideal

one

the

american
barley
wines
ive
ever
had
seek
out
and
drink
thanks
drjay
poured
at
a
tasting
event
brought
by
lou91
tasted
virtually
the
same
didnt
really
gain
much
in
flavor
maybe
a
bit
more
alcoholic
but
had
one
small
drawback
seemed
much
more
carbonated
strange
was
expecting
the
opposite
either
way
it
was
still
top
notch
a
very
nice
barleywine
it
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
burnt
orange
color
with
almost
no
head
at
all
the
color
was
very
nice
though
when
put
up
to
the
light
the
beer
gave
off
a
very
fig
like
smell
mixed
with
slight
alchohol
tones
the
flavor
was
one
of
great
balance
at
first
the
sweet
malts
hit
me
and
the
great
silky
mouthfeel
mixed
the
alchohol
flavors
in
well
with
the
rest
there
was
a
nice
raisen
and
citrus
flavor
and
it
finished
off
nice
and
clean
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
sneaking
through
i
wish
i
knew
what
year
this
was
becasue
it
seemed
like
it
had
aged
a
bit
and
the
hops
were
no
longer
there
to
balance
out
the
rest
of
the
flavors
a
very
solid
offering
and
one
worth
trying
old
numbskull
was
a
cloudy
dark
amber
color
with
little
lace
or
head
the
aroma
had
a
very
nice
hop
bouquet
with
essences
of
honey
toffee
and
alcohol
the
taste
was
smooth
and
rich
with
a
myriad
of
elements
that
included
fruitiness
sweetness
honey
toffee
and
alcohol
these
elements
lasted
into
the
flavorful
and
smooth
finish
which
had
a
slight
dryness
all
together
this
was
a
great
beer
and
well
worth
the
price
perfect
for
a
cold
damp
night
or
any
other
night
for
that
matter

this

real

flavors
and
a
sweet
and
bitter
combination
on
the
long
finish
a
real
treat
to
have
shared
a

of
this
with

thanks

i
believe
its
this
years
vintage
the
bottle
showed
an
abv
of
10
i
really
liked
this
one
and
was
pretty
impressed
aroma
was
a
bit
all
over
the
place
but
i
liked
where
it
went
some
sugar
spun
flowery
notes
and
with
a
dash
of
green
hop
arbor
and
twiggyness
burnished
copper
in
the
glass
filmy
thin
tan
head
five
minutes
into
this
brew
i
was
getting
those
warm
and
fuzzy
feelings
very
smooth
some
caramel
to
start
real
lemon
citrus
finish
manages
to
bring
a
big
and
bold
abv
down
to
easy
sipping
deliciousness
that
shared
bottle
was
enough
for
me
at
one
sitting
great
pair
with
2
year
old
montgomery
u
k
cheddar
drinkability
well
i
have
to
take
away
half
a
point
because
i
finished
the
bottle
solo
and
felt
quite
buzzed
for
a
bit
this
was
a
good
thing
especially
that
day
i
needed
it
but
i
couldnt
drink
too
much
more
of
it
one
was
plenty
and
it
took
a
while
to
come
back
down
a
wonderful
beer
and
even
at
13
99
i
will
get
another
to
cellar
i
know
its
a
lot
but
hell
its
a
limited
distribution
here
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
14
beige
head
over
the
dark
amber
brew
head
stands
pat
nice
lacing
especially
for
the
style
aroma
is
sweet
malts
assertive
hops
and
alcohol
taste
is
wellbalanced
even
though
substantial
malts
and
hops
are
present
dry
close
with
alcohol
warming
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
excellent
for
the
style
yum
incredibly
smooth
for
a
barleywine
but
lacking
some
of
the
complexity
that
i
would
expect
from
the
style
worth
a
try
especially
for
those
who
might
normally
shy
away
from
the
style
as
this
is
a
very
approachable
example
drinkable
for
its
strength
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
a
good
brew
no
doubt
but
no
speedway
stout
its
a
very
nice
barleywine
with
some
limited
complexity
but
overall
its
kind
of
obtuse
body
is
big
and
thick
with
a
chewy
mouthfeel
and
creamy
carbonation
definately
for
sipping
i
would
love
the
chance
to
dance
with
a
whole
750
to
myself
thanks
to
felton
for
sharing
this
rare
treat
drinkability
and
notes

hey
its
a
big
bottle
and
the
alcohol
means
that
you
need
two
people
minimum
to
polish
this
beer
off
in
one
sitting
that
said
this
is
probably
the
most
easily
drunken
barleywine
i
have
had
it
sticks
well
to
the
english
style
not
the
over
hopped
american
style
that
is
so
popular
today
if
you
are
looking
for
bigfoot
stay
away
if
you
want
a
deep
complex
balanced
barleywine
seek
this
one
out
i
should
have
kept
it
cellared
perhaps
i
drank
it
upon
purchase
still
a
fine
offering
and
a
noble
effort
for
category
i
did
not
get
much
smell
from
this
one
the
flavor
was
sweet
malty
with
moderate
bitterness
and
a
good
alcohol
bite
the
flavor
lasted
a
bit
this
had
a
light
body
and
slick
mouthfeel
i
would
not
rate
this
a
big
barley
wine
but
a
light
one
to
share
with
a
friend
this
is
a
really
nice
malty
barley
wine
i
think
i
could
happily
drink
it
slowly
all
night
its
a
great
sipping
drink
sweet
and
warm
a
superior
barleywine
well
carbonated
tasty
orange
and
some
roast
and
lovely

happy
bigbodied
oily
thick
and
syrupy
near
the
finish
whew
this
is
a
big
bottle
i
can
do
it
though
really
nice
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
dark
red
color
with
moderate
head
that
hangs
around
and
leaves
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
some
dark
fruit
and
molasses
with
some
hops
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
starts
out
very
malty
with
the
dark
fruits
it
is
followed
by
the
strong
hopping
and
finishes
bitter
very
well
rounded
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
very
well
constructed
barleywine
that
would
benefit
from
some
aging
alcohol
presence
is
a
bit
too
pronounced
at
this
stage
to
enjoy
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
sitting
wish
i
had
a
few
of
these
to
lay
down
the
beer
pours
a
very
pretty
dark
ruby
color
with
2
fingers
of
off
white
head
that
leaves
sticky
lace
as
it
recedes
towards
the
beer
the
nose
is
very
nice
there
is
a
deep
sweet
caramel
background
but
it
is
hidden
behind
a
load
of
hops
piney
spicey
hops
the
flavor
follows
suit
starting
very
sweet
and
slightly
roasted
almost
coffeelike
and
moving
towards
a
beautiful
hoppy
finish
what
a
well
built
barleywine
there
is
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
the
feel
is
deliciously
thick
and
rich
hot
damn
drinkability
is
fantastic
for
this
style
everything
comes
together
very
well
and
results
in
a
great
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
this
one
drinkability
is
very
good
incredibly
complex
even
for
a
complex
style
loads
of
interesting
flavors
and
great
transitions
despite
the
qc
problems
noted
in
the
pacific
beer
group
this
beer
was
fine
and
very
drinkable
it
poured
nice
and
alive
with
hints
of
belgian
sugar
and
yeast
sweet
and
slightly
skunky
honey
brown
and
opaque
it
looked
great
taste
had
seriously
mellowed
and
balanced
tastes
of
orange
peel
honey
and
fresh
baked
bread
the
hops
were
astringent
and
a
nice
compliment
to
the
melllow
malt
flavors
i
think
im
convinced
that
the
advice
to
drink
alesmith
fresh
may
be
well
said
i
am
numb
this
is
great
stuff
this
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
amber
color
and
formed
a
huge
foamy
off
white
head
that
coated
the
side
with
solid
lace
as
it
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
the
aroma
is
of
malt
hopscentennial
slight
candy
aspect
and
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
malt
slight
caramel
and
some
hops
the
body
is
fairly
heavy
if
not
quite
meaty
the
finish
is
slightly
astrigent
this
one
is
fairly
heavy
and
probably
needs
more
aging
to
mellow

the

the

with
a

more
going
on
here
that
i
would
have
to
drink
another
one
to
most
likely
identity
in
this
very
complex
and
wonderful
smell
the
taste
has
a
big
sweetness
up

that
tastes
of
caramel
rich
fruits
and
spiciness
the
hops
are
present
and
become
more
evident
as
this
one
warms
and
creates
a
bitter
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
thick

rich
and
has
decent
carbonation
this
is
a
very
smooth
barley
wine
that
seems
to
improve
with
age
from
what
i
have
read
it
is
excellent
at
the
point
it
is
now
with
a
very
complex
nose
and
taste
and
a
surprisingly
smooth
finish
i
can
only
imagine
how
it
could
improve

hard
to
describe
overall
but
every
flavor
is
well
presented
and
balanced
by
a
subtle
hop
character
and
frankly
the
best
dessert
pie
never
smelled
that
good
taste
displays
more
of
that
bubblegum
i
adore
along
with
that
chemy
melon
and
soft
marshmallows
after
a
few
sips
the
bitterness
gets
very
pronounced
grapefruity
dry
and
bitter
a
bit
too
much
for
me
to
appreciate
in
great
quantities
its
a
little
sad
though
because
its
my
new
favorite
alesmith
and
prefered
california
barley
wine
and
there
was
more
alcohol
than
i
had
hoped
for
in
the
taste
despite
being
completely
hidden
in
the
aroma
mouthfeel
is
top
notch
though
smooth
as
hell
velvety
chewy
and
creamy
mediumbodied
and
showing
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
did
i
say
i
like
the
aroma
the
flavor
was
outstanding
tons
of
dark
fruits
this
beer
was
juicy
and
big
and
massive
and
the
flavor
never
stopped
in
the
mouth
not
once
ripe
fruits
a
little
banana
with
black
cherries
finish
was
long
lasting
big
in
the
mouth
both
of
us
said
that
we
wanted
the
entire
750
ml
to
ourselves
and
we
meant
it
and
we
both
could
have
done
it
very
drinkable
barley
wine
barley
wine
a
style
that
is
closely
becoming
my
favorite
but
is
very
unmatched
compared
to
imperial
stouts
especially
speedway
i
have
had
3
beers
from
alesmith
so
far
ipa
speedway
and
numbskull
all
three
were
excellent
alesmith
is
amazing
at
this
point
i
have
a
new
favorite
brewery
a
simply
fantastic
barleywine
from
alesmith
and
i
have
to
thank
wvbeergeek
for
supplying
this
one
as
well
on
the
gathering
as
good
a
barleywine
as
ive
recently
had
and
certainly
one
ill
be
waiting
for
next
year

interesting
taste
creamy

bursts
of

with
that

coming
into

what
a
great
barley
wine
not
excessively
hoppy
brings
it
back
to
the
roots
of
a
true
barleywine
i
think
i
like
this
one
mouthfeel
big
beer
with
a
creamy
texture
to
it
i
would
classify
it
into
the
medium
to
full
bodied
range
what
a
brew
from
alesmith
drinkability
easy
drinking
high
abv
could
be
a
bad
combo
but
really
effortless
only
had
about
a
7
ounce
sample
but
boy
did
i
enjoy
note
after
decanting
the
beer
does
have
a
definite
obfuscated
burnished
copper
appearance
got
to
love
all
that
gunk
coating
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
tasty
lipsmackingly
delicious
ive
got
to
end
it
there
and
surely
thank
mr
longy
obeachbum
sir
darren
mcsumeriantrance
hisself
for
allowing
me
to
try
this
magnificent
bw
for
my
own
self
im
still
drnking
it
the
jurys
still
out
except
that
im
sure
that
is
among
my
favorites
serves
as
an
aboveaverage
nightcap
good
night
everyone
i
had
my
first
bottle
of
this
5
months
ago
before
i
joined
ba
and
didnt
remember
liking
it
this
much
good
stuff
would
love
to
try
it
aged
in
a
bourbon
barrel
hint
hint
flavor
is
presented
first
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
that
is
quickly
brutalized
from
the
tongue
by
a
burly
pine
hop
flower
flavor
that
lasts
through
to
very
last
caramelly
drop
makes
its
way
to
your
throat
with
a
long
lingering
warmth
of
alcohol
this
beer
when
held
up
to
the
light
is
a
hazy
copperorange
color
otherwise
it
is
a
fairly
drab
amber
color
it
is
topped
by
a
fairly
dense
tan
head
the
aroma
at
first
is
all
hops
grapefruit
flower
nectar
as
i
smell
more
the
malt
comes
out
in
the
aroma
the
malt
aroma
helps
to
thicken
the
aroma
of
the
hops
in
this
beer
the
taste
is
surprising
in
its
restraint
from
bitterness
the
hop
flavor
is
here
i
full
force
though
the
body
of
this
beer
is
like
a
beefy
giant
i
find
myself
enjoying
this
beer
quite
a
bit
the
interplay
of
the
malt
and
hop
is
quite
well
done
the
predominant
taste
is
that
of
a
hoppy
nectar
there
is
a
solid
malt
character
the
bitterness
is
fairly
subtle
for
an
over
hopped
big
beer
which
i
really
like
here
there
seems
to
be
some
light
oxidation
notes
here
perhaps
a
hint
of
sherry
which
helps
to
further
the
complexity
quite
enjoyable
and
i
have
a
full
750
to
savor
this
evening
however
it
was
worth
the
effort
most
definitely
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
barleywine
old
numbskull
it
was
a
pretty
dark
orangey
colour
with
a
good
sized
head
it
smelled
sweetish
and
citrusy
and
it
tasted
kind
of
similar
to
its
aroma
it
was
greatly
balanced
i
thought
with
the
hops
just
shining
through
the
malts
i
tasted
slightly
sourish
citrus
flavours
try
saying
that
5
times
fast
and
a
delicate
sweetness
that
made
me
want
more
i
thought
it
had
a
good
mouthfeel
and
better
drinkability
like
i
said
i
wanted
more
just
without
the
hassle
of
the
wax
that
wax
i
have
become
a
big
fan
of
alesmith
particularly
speedway
stout
this
one
poured
a
dark
amber
color
decent
head
and
retention
smelled
strongly
of
hops
more
like
a
strong
ipa
than
a
barley
wine
the
malt
sweetness
and
thick
body
are
there
but
the
green
bitterness
stands
way
up
front
an
assault
on
the
tastebuds
for
sure
clearly
a
quality
substantial
brew
i
have
become
a
big
barley
wine
fan
recently
and
this
is
as
good
as
any
hops
and
malt
both
excel
strong
yet
somehow
still
refreshing
a
truly
great
brew
ill
give
it
an
edge
over
bigfoot
and
old
crusty
it
took
awhile
for
me
to
work
up
to
the
really
strong
beers
but
i
love
them
now
add
this
to
the
speedway
ipa
and
wee
heavy
as
great
alesmith
beers
thanks
ron
this
is
a
wonderful
barleywine
from
the
fine
folks
at
alesmith
the
1999
vintage
of
old
numbskull
is
quite
a
chore
to
open
in
fact
my
girlfriend
can
attest
to
this
as
she
helped
me
peel
off
all
of
the
black
wax
that
this
bottle
is
sealed
in
after
you
get
to
the
cap
and
open
it
you
also
have
to
find
a
way
to
extract
the
rotting
cork
luckily
i
did
this
quite
easily
and
the
beer
that
this
rare
bottle
held
within
itself
was
definately
worth
all
of
this
effort
this
beer
pours
out
a
very
carbonated
deep
redpeach
colour
with
an
ample
head
of
white
bubbles
this
was
a
much
prettier
barleywine
than
i
expected
it
to
be
next
we
have
the
aromas
which
were
excellent
and
consisted
of
sweet
malts
slight
citric
and
floral
hops
and
a
nice
flare
of
alcoholic
spiciness
this
kind
of
reminded
me
of
hotds
doggie
claws
perhaps
99
dc
may
in
fact
smell
like
this
stuff
the
taste
is
wonderful
an
explosion
of
sweet
malts
with
almost
no
hint
of
alcohol
the
finish
reveals
some
soft
citric
and
floral
hops
as
well
as
a
nice
flare
of
spices
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
the
bottle
conditioning
and
careful
aging
of
this
beer
has
really
made
this
stuff
feel
like
silk
in
your
mouth
the
drinkability
is
incredible
as
you
could
knock
this
stuff
back
all
night
long
can
i
get
this
on
tap
somewhere
please
no
well
damn
you
than
this
is
really
a
penultimate
version
of
the
american
barleywine
handforged
to
perfection
by
the
brewers
at
alesmith
i
am
very
indebted
to
jcalabre
for
providing
me
with
this
old
cellared
example
of
what
i
believe
to
be
one
of
the
top
5
barleywines
made
in
the
unites
states
er
no
north
america
er
no
what
did
i
want
to
say
oh
yeah
the
world
750ml
bottle
surprisingly
hoppy
aroma
for
a
barley
wine
style
slightly
hazy
and
deep
amber
like
the
color
of
anchor
liberty
has
a
nice
big
head
and
laces
well
wonderful
peach
or
apricot
flavors
with
big
hops
that
are
bittering
although
not
a
typical
barley
wine
style
this
is
one
fantastic
brew
doesnt
have
the
sweet
malt
of
a
barley
but
more
like
an
imperial
ipa
alcohol
is
masked
completely
not
a
fan
of
barley
wine
but
this
was
right
up
my
alley
medium
red
brown
color
small
frothy
white
head
aroma
is
bready
malty
and
sweet
touches
of
fruit
and
some
mustiness
a
fullbodied
barley
wine
malts
are
nutty
bready
fruity
and
slightly
sweet
hops
are
grapefruity
and
slightly
bitter
the
malts
are
very
smooth
and
creamy
there
are
a
lot
of
complex
flavors
going
on
in
this
beer
nicely
balanced
and
very
smooth
the
malts
really
shine
in
this
english
style
barley
wine
hides
the
10
alcohol
very
well
nice
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
thanks
to
gusler
for
the
bottle
eh
this
is
the
2002
vintage
theres
no
date
on
the
bottle
which
is
a
750
ml
green
champagnestyle
bottle
with
the
old
numbskull
logo
in
blue
and
a
silver
foil
around
the
top
no
cork
poured
into
my
glass
its
a
dark
brown
brew
with
a
reddish
hue
topped
by
a
small
tannish
head
the
head
goes
down
before
too
long
to
a
modest
lace
clinging
to
the
edges
of
the
glass
i
have
to
say
this
is
the
most
unique
barleywine
ive
ever
smelled
not
only
am
i
getting
the
expected
caramel
malt
english
hops
and
citrus
character
the
brewer
is
said
to
have
used
a
mix
of
american
and
englishstyle
barleywine
brewing
techniques
and
spicy
alcohol
im
getting
some
tart
apple
and
apricot
as
well
the
flavors
are
just
as
complex
at
the
front
some
english
hop
bitterness
sets
the
stage
and
then
a
smooth
wave
of
caramel
malt
takes
over
the
malt
is
slightly
bready
and
yeasty
as
well
a
bit
of
fruitiness
is
present
some
fig
and
plum
as
well
as
a
bit
of
the
tart
apple
that
was
present
in
the
nose
very
belgian
a
hint
of
american
citrus
is
detectable
leafyplum
skin
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
very
pleasant
extremely
smooth
mouthfeel
surprisingly
lighter
bodied
than
most
barleywines
but
very
complex
and
enjoyable
very
interesting
and
unique
take
on
the
style
its
like
belgium
meets
america
meets
england
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
one
notes
clearly
drank
this
one
before
its
prime
hopinduced
citrus
qualities
havent
been
given
enough
time
to
meld
with
their
malt
counterparts
will
rereview
present
incarnation
not
nearly
the
equal
of
say
victorys

trying
the
1999
vintage
its
a
hazy
burnt
orange
color
w
a
small
head
a
nise
nose
of
green
apples
velvety
on
the
tongue
sweet
its
a
delite
now
the
downside
the
cork
was
sealed
w
some
sort
of
shrinkwrapped
rubber
that
had
adhered
to
the
bottle
via
concrete
what
a
pain
in
the
ass
to
open
2000
vintage
reddish
brown
in
color
malty
w
a
slightly
sweet
taste
a
dry
finish
i
taste
a
little
vanillaorange
flavor
very
nice
notes
a
touch
of
age
has
hit
the
brew
it
seems
to
be
at
its
peak
if
not
passing
it
so
this
holiday
winter
season
of
20022003
is
the
time
to
pop
the
2000
impressive
and
a
good
go
at
the
barleywine
style
this
is
for
the
2000
numbskull
tasted
on
102502
nice
medium
maltiness
starts
off
a
bit
bland
but
the
bitterness
slowly
picks
up
as
does
the
alcohol
ends
up
really
good
body
is
dark
reddish
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
theres
some
lemon
zest
in
the
aroma
i
think
its
a
compbination
of
the
alcohol
malt
and
yeast
its
golden
brown
and
has
good
looking
offwhite
head
that
leaves
traces
on
top
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
reminiscent
of
bigfoot
but
slightly
on
the
mellower
side
the
hops
are
definitely
there
but
they
dont
smack
you
in
the
face
the
citrus
flavors
tend
to
dominate
and
detract
slightly
from
the
drinking
experience
despite
the
9
25
abv
the
flavor
of
alcohol
doesnt
make
itself
obvious
it
has
an
almost
milky
mouthfeel
that
is
reassuring
in
a
barleywine
its
good
but
its
not
one
of
the
best
from
alesmith
vintage
2011
huge
malt
bill
very
one
dimensional
i
would
have
liked
to
try
this
fresh
complexity
delivered
with
atop
a
big
malty
base
well
rounded
with
lots
of
balanced
but
strong
flavors
i
like
the
interplay
between
the
caramel
and
the
spicy
raisin
notes
2013
bottle
did
not
pick
up
any
bitterness
this
tasted
similar
to
2011
bigfoot
great
beer
2013
very
similar
to
2008
but
with
some
risidual
hop
bitterness
and
a
slightly
less
refined
flavor
still
incredible
and
delicious
but
slightly
less
so
than
the
aged
bottle
taste
and
smell
alcohol
smooth
and
strong
kinda
like
port
wine
potent
the
body
is
smooth
chewy
below
average
carbonation
warming
with
a
hot
alcohol
burn
overall
very
happy
i
picked
this
up
really
good
overall
2010
bottle
pours
a
rich
deep
mahogany
brown
with
a
cherry
hue
amazing
head
retention
great
lacing
huge
thick

aroma
is

toffee

taste
is
bitter
molasses
stale
tobacco
vanilla
and
wet
paper
nice
rich
body
and
low

i
believe
this
beer
must
have
been
left
on
the
shelf
in
a
high
light
area
since
2010
it
looked
great
but
the
paper
and
tobacco
really
ruined
the
flavor
o
a
very
hop
heavy
barley
wine
more
of
a
double
ipa
than
a
barley
wine
if
you
like
over
the
top
northwest
style
ipas
then
this
is
for
you
if
you
like
english
style
barley
wines
avoid
this
one
o
this
beer
is
fantastic
the
hops
are
pretty
faded
and
the
nose
i
was
getting
off
the
pour
was
just
straight
aromatic
hops
but
once
the
beer
settled
a
minute
it
was
almost
all
gone
this
beer
has
aged
very
gracefully
and
there
isnt
the
slightest
hint
of
oxidation
i
have
always
liked
this
barleywine
one
that
is
great
fresh
or
with
some
age
a
big
malty
character
with
enough
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
nothing
is
out
of
balance
which
is
a
downfall
of
many
american
versions
as
always
highly
recommended
i
had
been
trying
to
find
this
elusive
bw
for
awhile
my
local
whole
food
came
through
and
allowed
me
to
buy
a
couple
not
sure
i
would
let
this
age
more
than
a
couple
years
but
it
was
a
good
session
not
the
greatest
bw
out
there
but
one
of
my
favorites
from
alaskan
brewing
very
interesting
was
expecting
something
totally
different
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
dont
know
if
this
follows
strict
barley
wine
guidelines
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
first
taste
was
of
the
hops
then
everything
else
set
in
quite
complex
i
will
look
for
this
beer
again
found
it
on
tap
but
would
like
to
try
in
bottles
this
is
simply
a
superblybrewed
barley
wine
thats
robust
in
all
the
right
places
mf
warming
with
a
touch
of
creaminess
full
bodied
with
a
semidry
finish
a
bit
too
hot
in
the
finish
for
me
3
75
vintage
2008
from
the
beerchives
sips
more
like
a
fine
dessert
wine
or
cognac
than
a
beer
outstanding
not
sure
that
this
is
the
barley
wine
standard
but
its
pretty
close
excels
at
every
aspect
glad
i
purchased
it
on
a
whim
highly
recommended
overall
a
great
offering
from
alaskan
brewing
they
will
certainly
get
a
few
more
looks
from
me
after
this
one
drinking
incredibly
well
after
a
couple
years
of
aging
hit
all
the
major
checkpoints
a
barley
wine
should
expect
maybe
for
the
overpowering
barley
on
the
nose
other
then
that
no
complaints
o
this
beer
has
held
up
pretty
well
for
6
years
it
smells
amazing
and
is
a
little
oxidized
but
still
quite
tasty
the
beer
pours
a
murky
reddishbrown
with
some
great
ruby
highlights
around
the
edges
a
tight
beige
head
is
well
retained
and
provides
a
curtain
of
lacing
as
the
beer
is
consumed
lush
rich
malt
aromas
provide
the
senses
with
hints
of
cherries
and
plums
piney
hop
aromas
also
join
in
with
some
caramel
and
a
touch
of
booze
to
round
out
this
wonderfully
aromatic
brew
this
barley
wine
ages
with
beauty
and
grace
the
malt
complexity
is
much
more
defined
with
the
dark
fruits
taking
the
lead
with
caramel
and
toffee
sweetness
playing
an
important
role
as
well
generous
hopping
has
helped
to
maintain
some
of
the
piney
profile
and
cover
a
bit
of
the
alcohol
burn
mediumfull
in
body
this
5
yearold
brew
is
lower
in
carbonation
d
not
bad
it
clearly
has
some
age
on
it
and
smells
quite
nice
the
flavor
isnt
quite
as
well
developed
with
a
sweetness
that
isnt
quite
balanced
by
what
reminds
of
the
hops
overall
i
like
the
drinkability
its
flavorful
and
definitely
becomes
more
drinkable
as
it
is
enjoyed
not
too
much
in
the
way
of
hops
with
only
mild
complexity
skol
overall
we
were
very
impressed
with
the
pilot
series
barleywine
and
completely
enjoyed
it
wire
to
wire
it
was
my
ladys
very
first
experience
with
the
style
and
she
was
completely
blown
away
my
beer
geek
pal
and
i
are
a
tad
jaded
and
werent
exactly
blown
away
but
it
was
still
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
he
and
i
both
recently
had
our
tongues
scraped
raw
by
a
fresh
2013
bigfoot
and
were
very
pleased
to
be
able
to
spend
some
time
enjoying
a
really
good
barleywine
with
a
bit
of
age
on
it
the
rest
of
the
2013
bigfoots
bigfeet
bigs
foot
have
been
sequestered
in
deep
storage
to
avoid
any
further
unpleasantness
and
to
hopefully
achieve
the
blissful
state
that
others
report
is
possible
but
this
pilot
series
effectively
wiped
away
the
memory
will
definitely
be
seeking
out
another
bottle
or
two
for
safe
keeping
o
smooth
and
subdued
a
touch
oxidized
but
still
very
pleasant
overall
a
really
superb
barleywine
but
maybe
lacking
complexity
still
a
good
one
to
introduce
someone
to
the
style
very
drinkable
and
approachable
for
such
a
traditionally
big
heavy
beer
overall
very
nice
if
unspectacular
nice
flavors
that
would
probably
get
better
with
age
o
ive
been
looking
to
try
this
one
out
for
a
while
and
glad
to
finally
have
had
it
its
a
nice
barleywine
but
it
doesnt
do
much
to
differentiate
itself
from
other
barleywines
in
fact
as
i
keep
drinking
this
i
find
this
one
resembling
moylans
just
not
as
hop
forward
and
just
a
bit
more
balanced
o
its
quite
good
like
most
aged
barley
wines
this
one
was
quite
sweet
but
it
still
had
some
hop
bite
and
heat
from
alcohol
flavor
follows
nose
sweet
but
not
cloying
honey
and
toffee
caramel
big
bready
malt
character
thats
highly
satisfying
distant
traces
of
faded
citrus
hops
lending
the
slightest
bitterness
light
fruity
notes
mellow
but
present
alcohol
mediumfull
body
medium
carbonation
nicely
smooth
and
somewhat
sticky
feel
made
for
an
excellent
nightcap
on
a
cold
and
rainy
winters
evening
a
great
aged
barley
wine
ive
had
it
fresh
but
certainly
prefer
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
pick
one
up
if
you
havent
o
very
delicious
barleywine
that
has
aged
nicely
still
a
little
hop
bite
to
it
from
the
dry
hopping
but
the
dark
fruit
and
malts
really
steal
the
show
wish
i
had
another
to
age
o
this
is
my
first
vintage
brew
the
first
thing
that
hit
me
as
i
poored
it
into
my
glass
was
bananabubblegum
as
i
searched
deeper
i
found
this
beer
to
be
complex
and
full
of
layers
a
variety
of
awesome
dark
fruits
leather
vanilla
apple
cider
and
warming
booze
that
had
me
checking
the
bottle
to
make
sure
its
not
ba
its
not
as
it
warms
sweet
malts
become
more
apparent
and
apple
cider
begins
to
take
over
for
the
dark
fruits
hop
presence
is
really
only
apparent
in
burps
but
you
get
a
faint
grapefruit
bitterness
only
after
the
beer
has
warmed
to
almost
room
temp
im
glad
i
waited
to
review
this
until
after
the
second
glass
its
full
of
glorious
floaties
and
so
much
more
complex
flavors
have
shown
themselves
allowing
me
to
write
a
full
review
my
local
liquor
store
still
has
about
8
bottles
of
this
and
i
plan
on
grabbing
atleast
2
more
to
see
how
this
brew
turns
out
12
years
from
now
alaskan
barleywine
pours
a
very
deep
brown
with
a
decent
amount
of
ruby
highlights
just
under
two
fingers
of
light
tan
foam
rise
up
and
crown
the
beer
head
retention
is
decent
and
theres
just
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
is
nice
with
aromas
of
caramel
fruity
esters
and
grapefruit
all
swimming
out
of
the
glass
the
malt
presence
that
first
greets
me
with
each
sip
is
a
well
defined
toffee
flavor
some
dried
figs
and
apricots
swim
through
mid
palate
the
finish
features
a
potent
hop
bite
and
a
dank
grapefruit
peel
hoppiness
the
hops
are
holding
up
fairly
well
so
far
keeping
this
firmly
on
the
american
rather
than
english
half
of
the
barleywine
spectrum
the
body
while
sturdy
isnt
as
full
and
syrupy
as
some
others
while
part
of
me
likes
that
in
a
barleywine
this
does
help
a
lot
with
drinkability
carbonation
is
suitably
understated
alaskan
barleywine
is
drinking
really
nicely
right
now
i
think
it
may
be
heading
towards
an
awkward
phase
as
it
transitions
from
hop
forward
to
malt
forward
but
i
just
find
myself
wishing
i
had
another
bottle
to
see
what
this
brews
like
after
it
has
finished
that
transition
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
a
little
below
average
overall
it
was
a
really
good
beer
it
had
a
lot
of
rich
and
bold
flavors
to
it
but
managed
to
stay
pretty
well
balanced
for
the
style
i
really
liked
the
way
it
aged
as
well
great
beer
to
sip
on
this
evening
mouthfeel
is
still
a
bit
thick
and
the
carbonation
is
there
despite
next
to
no
head
retention
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
american
barley
wines
great
beer
for
the
price
and
relatively
easy
to
find
in
abundance
happy
that
i
have
three
more
2011s
to
age
for
years
to
come
if
youre
on
the
fence
dont
be
give
it
a
shot
overall
i
would
be
happy
to
have
this
in
my
fridge
every
damn
night
great
hop
presence
keeps
this
one
on
the
american
side
of
the
pond
when
it
comes
to
the
barleywines
but
its
not
too
over
the
top
and
has
a
pretty
good
overall
balance
bit
of
a
sipper
with
the
big
body
and
abv
but
im
not
going
to
have
any
problem
polishing
it
off
on
my
own
and
i
might
be
hesitant
to
share
such
an
awesome
offering
overall
an
exceptional
barleywine
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
and
highly
recommended
in
my
book
o
overall
a
very
good
barelywine
drinkable
right
when
i
bought
it
not
over
hopped
well
balanced
done
right
medium
to
full
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
especially
for
10
70
abv
this
is
a
very
underrated
barleywine
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
overall
the
flavor
is
a
little
flat
and
dull
but
its
quite
a
mouthful
label
says
its
the
2011
vintage
in
the
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
hazy
amber
to
reddish
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
small
fruit
presence
of
dark
fruits
raisins
and
figs
in
the
taste
dry
dark
fruitiness
of
raisin
with
a
note
of
like
tobacco
in
the
end
a
smooth
and
medium
to
bigger
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
raisin
and
small
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
quite
smooth
dark
fruits
and
a
small
alcohol
presence
this
one
i
call
yum
one
of
the
better
puttogether
barleywines
ive
had
in
a
while
color
me
impressed
o
i
was
a
little
dissapointed
with
this
beer
not
that
its
bad
but
it
just
wasnt
what
i
thought
it
would
be
with
all
the
talk
about
it
alaskan
has
yet
to
really
impress
me
outside
of
their
smoked
porter
this
seems
to
me
like
an
average
barleywine
with
dangerous
drinkablility
it
just
doesnt
have
the
depth
or
complexity
that
i
expect
when
i
hear
barleywine
a
solid
drink
and
worth
trying
but
i
wont
be
putting
too
many
side
for
later
pours
a
clear
dark
cola
brown
with
an
inch
of
khaki
foam
that
persists
with
loads
of
lace
very
inviting
appearance
smells
are
floral
fruit
tropical
elements
caramel
malt
taste
vanilla
fruits
including
plums
dark
cherries
blood
oranges
toffee
malt
with
a
slightly
resinearthy
hop
that
keeps
it
all
tied
together
mouthfeel
is
luxurious
with
a
mediumheavy
body
thats
perfectly
carbonated
very
very
nice
overall
an
excellent
big
barleywine
and
the
best
crafted
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewer
hands
down
o
definitely
a
fresh
american
barleywine
fairly
notable
hop
taste
and
bitterness
as
well
as
some
booze
in
the
nose
and
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
its
quite
good
lots
of
complexity
with
a
good
balance
of
flavors
to
boot
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
i
think
with
a
few
years
on
it
it
could
be
even
better
medium
bodied
and
still
surprisingly
hoppy
with
resinous
bitter
and
dry
piny
hops
this
is
countered
by
a
prominent
earthy
malt
character
leathery
and
slightly
boozy
with
caramel
toffee
and
faint
dark
fruit
notes
malt
becomes
more
prominent
as
it
warns
waves
of
sweet
booze
come
and
go
and
even
though
the
abv
is
relatively
well
masked
i
get
a
strong
ethanol
rush
in
the
finish
nice
barleywine
good
tones
of
sweet
malts
that
arent
overdoing
it
does
seem
a
little
fresh
and
could
use
some
age
to
mellow
out
the
slight
hot
tone
and
i
do
say
slight
but
i
feel
like
that
is
applicable
to
so
many
barleywines
since
they
are
always
released
so
soon
after
brewing
easy
to
drink
i
like
it
o
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
beast
its
still
kind
of
a
monster
at
this
age
though
its
rounded
nicely
i
prefer
it
fresh
with
a
more
robust
hop
presence
deep
reddish
amber
body
clear
one
finger
tan
head
not
much
going
on
in
the
nose
a
bit
of
roast
lot
of
hops
citrus
taste
is
much
more
complex
than
the
nose
hop
forward
citrus
some
light
brown
sugar
molasses
honey
mouthfeel
is
medium
decent
effervescence
a
bit
sticky
unfortunately
i
drank
this
too
young
would
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
cellars
excellent
brew
served
at
a
good
temperature
and
with
a
nice
light
tan
thick
foamy
head
and
plenty
of

is
a
clear
dark
red
amber
aroma
is

taffy
flavor
is
like
nose
but
with
a
lot
more
going
on
malt
sweet
is
on
top
with
plenty
of
hop
and
yeast
bitter
under
then
a
little
carbonic
tang
to
complete
the
experience
body
is
full
and
lush
but
with
ever
so
slight
bitter
points
carbonation
is
spot
on
finish
is
just
as
it
should
be
for
the
style
long
boozy
and
satisfying
one
or
two
would
be
just
right
very
well
crafted
product
did
not
really
expect
the
tropical
fruit
elements
to
come
from
an
alaskan
barleywine
still
a
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
this
is
outstanding
what
a
great
barleywine
i
wish
i
had
more
of
these
cheers
excellent
beer
alaskan
nailed
this
one
a
22oz
bottle
of
alaskan
barley
wine
is
basically
the
adult
version
of
a
pacifier
burp
me
and
im
ready
for
bed
all
is
right
with
the
world
and
good
night
indeed
the
sweet
syrupy
honeylike
coating
on
my
lips
will
last
long
after
i
turn
the
lights
out
which
truthfully
is
the
only
logical
thing
to
do
by
the
end
of
the
bomber
sweet
dreams
overall
this
stuff
is
very
solid
it
has
an
enjoyable
balance
and
hefty
warm
malt
laden
body
that
i
tend
to
like
more
out
of
a
barley
wine
i
really
liked
this
stuff
and
will
most
definatley
pick
up
more
of
it
overall
sadly
not
really
impressed
with
this
beer
there
was
an
offputting
metallic
taste
that
i
couldnt
get
past
and
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
curious
how
very
old
vintages
taste
glad
i
have
another
to
age
a
while
overall
a
fantastic
brew
really
a
nice
beer
i
have
a
hard
time
telling
folks
about
this
beer
as
its
a
nice
hidden
pnw
secret
thin
dirty
tan
head
was
tough
to
pull
up
even
with
a
hard
pour
down
the
middle
the
head
fell
quickly
to
nearly
nothing
iridescent
ale
that
moves
between
copper
and
mahogany
dry
hopping
apparent
in
the
nose
along
with
a
strong
alcohol
hotness
from
the
10
7
abv
hops
smells
like
a
combination
of
english
and
northwest
hops
not
listed
on
the
websitejust
a
guess
dark
cherry
figs
raisins
and
a
strong
caramel
maltbut
still
hangs
below
the
hops
heavy
fruit
and
alcohol
continue
in
the
taste
to
support
a
strong
hop
bite
while
not
a
lightweight
ale
the
beer
has
a
subtle
balance
between
big
hop
malt
and
alcohol
everything
is
big
but
balanced
so
the
effect
is
sweet
and
mellow
as
it
warms
all
three
elements
open
up
and
invade
the
senses
drink
it
slow

this
is
very

a
great
barleywine
that
is
good
fresh
and
better
cellared
o
exceeded
my
expectations
i
cant
complain
good
stuff
overall
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
barleywine
for
a
fresh
bottle
it
is
very
smooth
with
no
noticeable
alcohol
heat
could
of
used
a
little
more
hop
bite
but
the
fruity
flavors
are
pretty
nice
wow
this
beer
is
offthecharts
good
in
my
book
i
usually
like
to
age
barleywines
but
this
one
would
not
last
in
my
fridge
just
excellent
look
and
taste
highly
recommended
fuller
medium
body
milder
carbonation
creamy
and
slick
on
the
tongue
this
really
aged
nicely
with
minimal
oxidation
and
improved
malt
flavor
the
heat
has
subsided
as
well
making
it
even
more
enjoyable
id
definitely
like
more
of
this
having
had
several
barley
wines
i
was
excited
to
try
this
on
tap
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
a
definite
boozy
note
a
little
stronger
than
the
typical
barley
wine
the
taste
was
very
much
the
same
sweet
boozy
and
a
little
lighter
than
others
ive
had
the
alcohol
was
noticeable
as
was
the
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
end
a
tasty
midrange
barley
wine
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
ill
have
it
again
though
as
an
inexpensive
version
of
one
of
my
favorite
beer
styles
overall
not
a
badtasting
brew
at
all
to
be
frank
its
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
but
its
still
a
pleasure
to
sample
and
think
about
2009
vintage

not

id
hoped
it
to
be

as
the
ratings
indicate
id
be
open
to
trying
out
a

version
in
the
near

man
were
talking
some
extreme
raisin
character
in
this
beer
probably
more
pronounced
than
any
other
beer
ive
had
possibly
even
raison
dextra
aftershocks
of
sweet
caramel
booze
light
dashes
of
brown
sugar
hints
of
wood
and
leafy

intensely
flavorful
but
pretty
wellmellowed
by
aging
for
4
years
very
enjoyable
selection
cheers
o
tastes
like
an
ale
not
a
supersweet
barleywine
which
makes
this
a
great
beer
i
put
this
in
the
fridge
tonight
the
day
i
purchased
it
to
see
if
i
should
get
some
to
age
well
im
going
to
need
lots
of
this
beer
to
drink
now
and
age
wonderful
stuff
which
i
hope
to
enjoy
many
more
times
d
i
like
big
barleywines
less
as
i
get
older
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
have
to
buy
another
bottle
and
let
it
age
a
little
the
beer
is
a
good
drinker
and
offers
a
very
nice
head
i
really
enjoy
this
style
and
a
would
get
this
beer
again
but
if
i
do
it
will
be
for
purposes
of
storing
in
my
cellar
for
a
few
years
final
thought
alaskan
you
made
a
wonderful
beer
full
of
flavor
and
life
and
i
want
a
case
please
11
and
8
a
pop
pick
these
up
for
sure
the
flavor
is
big
on
the
sweetness
it
also
seems
yeastier
than
the
average
barleywine
nice
alcoholic
punch
but
not
too
much
slight
bitterness
which
is
sad
after
smelling
the
aroma
but
it
still
is
a
nice
barleywine
o
a
very
good
barleywine
definitely
a
sipper
it
would
be
nice
if
this
one
came
in
12s
instead
of
bombers
or
ill
just
have
to
be
sure
to
share
the
next
one
this
is
a
great
barleywine
and
is
unique
and
certainly
a
nice
surprise
from
alaskan
this
barleywine
is
very
complex
and
seems
to
offer
a
lot
of
different
ingredients
and
technique
in
the
flavor
well
made
and
a
must
try
overall
a
really
nicely
aged
barleywine
with
some
great
flavors
that
work
really
well
together
this
held
up
great
as
well
the
alcohol
heat
hop
character
and
sweetness
all
match
very
well
together
a
great
sipper
definitely
recommended
and
a
welcome
addition
to
any
cellar

20
march
2012
somehow
that
2008
keg
is
still
on
and
ive
had
probably
a
gallon
of
it
absolutely
incredible
aged
i
actually
took
a
2nd
glass
and
poured
a
5050
blend
of
bourbon
this
bw
into
it
and
the
sum
is
not
as
good
as
its
parts
the
bourbon
is
better
alone
as
is
the
beer
overall
excellently
balanced
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
especially
for
the
abv
complex
without
the
appearance
of
trying
too
hard
the
alcohol
content
is
present
but
does
not
overpower
the
other
elements
this
is
a
very
solid
tasty
barley
wine
i
dont
think
its
one
of
the
better
ones
that
ive
had
but
it
certainly
was
worth
trying
another
solid
alaskan
offering
o
really
tasty
i
didnt
find
it
nearly
as
hot
as
some
others
have
oh
so
rich
and
a
great
way
to
end
the
night
overall
a
pretty
great
barleywine
for
aging
and
also
one
thats
pretty
easy
to
get
during
the
winter
thanks
for
the
great
brew
alaskan
i
bought
this
beer
in
portland
or
and
drove
it
south
to
san
francisco
ca
from
there
i
flew
it
to
pittsburgh
pa
from
pittsburgh
it
road
in
my
trunk
to
ithaca
ny
where
myself
and
another
friend
finally
drank
it
a
month
or
two
later
this
beer
was
worth
it
given
the
chance
i
would
probably
buy
a
few
bottles
of
this
also
my
guess
is
that
this
has
at
least
another
year
of
aging
left
in
it
while
it
tastes
great
now
alaskans
barleywine
has
a
few
flavors
i
find
a
lot
in
lesser
barleywines
i
dont
think
id
enjoy
it
fresh
at
three
years
however
it
displays
incredible
smoothness
good
stuff
d
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easy
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
strong
sipper
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
while
taste
has
some
great
flavour
but
a
little
too
hot
and
alcoholic
throwing
off
the
balance
and
interfering
with
the
character
too
much
it
has
strong
portsoaked
gingerbread
with
whisky
spicy
fruit
some
dryer
toasty
dark
bread
in
the
finish
some
faint
woodyleafiness
esp
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
and
some
candied
whiskysoaked
dried
fruit
it
has
a
nice
full
feel
frothy
and
creamy
rather
than
quite
being
oily
o
a
very
average
american
barleywine
at
two
years
alaskan
barley
wine
ale
will
not
be
on
my
musthave
list
in
the
future
overall
its
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
and
certainly
something
you
should
try
if
you
like
barleywines
overall
solid
not
standout
but
quality
i
have
a
2008
that
will
be
interesting
to
compare
this
to
2009
bottle
that
pours
a
deep
mahagony
with
a
finger
of
foam
that
leaves
viscous
lacing
the
nose
and
taste
mirror
each
other
with
booze
soaked
prune
bourbon
vanilla
notes
as
well
as
toffee
and
slight
sherried
rancio
notes
the
taste
is
very
hot
and
comes
across
as
being
pretty
astringent
i
did
not
find
this
to
be
an
all
too
easy
drinking
barley
wine
wow
this
is
such
a
phenomenal
barley
wine
i
am
getting
such
a
balanced
brown
sugary
taste
nice
malts
with
a
smooth
finish
some
caramel
notes
and
a
delicious
lingering
sweetness
when
i
open
a
barley
wine
this
is
what
i
want
it
to
taste
like
what
a
gem
deep
reddish
amber
color
with
creamy
offwhite
head
sweet
caramel
malt
brown
sugar
citrus
and
nugget
hop
bitterness
im
a
sucker
for
nugget
hops
aroma
more
or
less
matches
the
flavor
some
alcohol
warmth
going
down
nice
full
mouthfeel
overall
this
beer
is
fairly
fine
i
think
this
beer
lives
up
to
its
american
barleywine
style
in
all
of
its
characteristics
if
youre
a
fan
of
these
styles
of
beers
then
you
will
enjoy
this
beer
overall
its
a
solid
beer
but
it
needs
some
more
head
and
lacing
taste
also
falls
a
little
short
but
still
good
needs
a
more
dominating
flavor
from
some
aspect
full
bodied
softish
but
with
a
bit
of

poured

with
an

with
a
strong

flavor
was
malty
doughy

moderate
bitterness
with
some
warmth
in

this
seems
to
walk
the
line
between
an
english
and
an
american
barley
wine
the
color
and
syrupy
rich
malt
nature
of
this
beer
seems
english
the
high
hops
presence
seem
like
they
are
set
on
this
side
of
the
pond
although
this
beer
is
from
the
edge
of
the
next
pond
dark
brown
and
maroon
body
good
head
fades
to
nothing
this
really
seems
like
a
hybrid
of
two
substyles
a
well
made
beer
doing
its
own
thing
what
can
i
say
its
a
very
nice
beer
not
the
best
of
the
best
but
a
worthy
souvenir
to
bring
back
from
the
great
white
north
mf
thick
and
fullbodied
with
some
syrupy
aspects
but
does
not
exactly
feel
overly
full
a
good
relatively
simple
and
sweet
barleywine
a
pleasure
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
barley
wine
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
to
spend
an
evening
sipping
on
the
only
downside
is
the
strength
of
the
alcohol
in
the
taste
very
strong
and
overwhelms
what
seems
to
be
a
subtle
complex
malt
profile
overall
i
am
thinking
that
alaska
makes
the
best
barleywines
on
the
planet
because
after
these
two
and
arctic
devil
which
i
had
a
month
back
why
drink
anything
else
twoplus
and
threeplus
years
of
aging
on
each
of
these
has
done
them
beer
no
injustices
they
are
both
amazing
lovers
of
this
style
must
seek
out
and
sample
this
beer
i
am
glad
i
have
more
aged
versions
and
a
fresh
2010
to
compare
in
the
near
future
to
compare
and
contrast
both
07
and
08
are
amazing
and
while
they
arent
tremendously
different
they
are
unique
enough
to
appreciate
why
it
is
important
and
worth
while
to
age
some

a

warmth
in

with

overall
this
is
a
good
barleywine
that
i
can
only
imagine
will
get
better
with
age
i
have
another
one
of
these
aging
in
my
cellar
and
i
am
curious
to
see
how
this
beer
develops
in
a
few
years
very
nice
vintage
id
love
to
compare
it
to
a
fresh
version
perhaps
in
another
trade
d
despite
being
about
4years
old
this
still
packs
a
serious
punch
very
rich
and
dense
with
nice
sweet
and
fruit
flavors
if
you
still
have
bottles
of
this
vintage
it
still
has
tons
of
life
left
in
it
for
the
future
though
it
is
quite
good
now
this
however
is
a
drinkable
barley
wine
that
is
delicate
velvety
well
balanced
beer
10
7
abv
per
what
the
bottle
says
its
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
i
had
a
22
oz
bottle
and
slowly
consumed
it
over
35
to
40
minutes
the
hour
passed
and
it
might
of
been
the
alcohol
but
i
could
of
had
another
12
oz
try
this
one
out
i
know
if
i
come
across
it
again
im
buying
it
ontap
at
stanleys
northeast
in
minneapolis
this
beer
arrives
in
a
stemless
wine
glass
the
beer
is
a
clear
ambertawny
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
of
white
foam
that
recedes
slowly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
toffee
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
aroma
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
without
the
chocolate
notes
it
only
has
a
few
noticeable
flavors
but
the
depth
of
those
flavors
is
immense
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
and
appropriately
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
that
i
will
surely
drink
again
overall
a
good
barley
win
mmmm
so
smooth
everything
has
come
together
quite
nicely
on
this
one
hops
are
still
kicking
on
the
back
end
and
the
malts
are
caramely
sweet
and
oxidized
i
have
not
enjoyed
an
american
barleywine
this
much
in
a
very
long
time
has
alot
going
on
but
maintains
a
smooth
easy
drinking
presence
that
is
stunning
i
have
never
had
this
fresh
but
i
sure
would
like
to
now
draft
2009
vintage
served
at
pracna
on
main
for
mn
craft
beer
week
served
in
a
snifter
poured
a
non
see
through
brown
color
with
a
slight
wispy
tan
head
that
collars
around
the
glass
surpisingly
mild
aroma
of
dark
fruit
and
some
underlying
sweetness
sweet
dark
fruit
raisin
and
prune
with
a
pretty
heavy
malt
backbone
mediumheavy
mouthfeel
slight
booze
in
the
end
but
otherwise
pretty
nicely
hidden
both
in
the
aroma
and
the
taste
overall
really
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
but
not
as
complex
as
other
bws
ive
had
before
2009
vintage
poured
in
my
bruery
tulip
dark
red
with
patches
of
light
that
get
through
when
i
hold
it
up
smells
of
plums
and
a
little
alcohol
when
i
take
a
sip
i
get
sweetness
and
no
alcohol
burn
im
guessing
its
because
this
is
2
years
old
and
things
mellowed
out
now
this
makes
me
want
to
get
a
fresh
bottle
and
do
a
side
by
side
tasting
i
also
want
to
get
another
bottle
and
throw
it
in
my
cellar
for
another
year
or
2
i
love
their
smoked
porter
and
now
i
found
another
favorite
of
alaskan
brewing
company
gonna
let
the
second
bottle
sit
a
bit
longer
this
beer
is
probably
near
its
peak
overall
have
to
say
this
one
was
not
bad
at
all
really
a
tight
little
barley
wine
here
almost
an
old
ale
but
not
quite
i
could
see
myself
having
this
one
again
in
the
near
future
2008
bottle
thanks
to
some
awesome
former
trader
pours
reddish
brown
with
a
healthy
tannish
head
looks
great
smell
is
brown
sugar
caramel
and
a
touch
of
faded
hops
the
taste
is
wow
crazy
smooth
the
hops
are
present
only
a
touch
in
the
finish
and
balance
the
medium
sweetness
present
in
the
base
of
the
beer
this
is
just
deadon
balance
not
too
sweet
and
not
overly
hopped
the
reserved
flavor
of
sugary
malts
carry
through
the
body
fabulous
not
in
extreme
flavor
but
actually
in
its
restraint
the
mouthfeel
has
good
carbonation
and
not
too
sugar
coating
and
thick
very
good
in
this
department
as
well
overall
this
beer
as
an
08
is
fantastic
with
no
booze
present
and
incredible
balance
in
general
american
barleywine
with
2
years
of
age
seems
to
be
just
the
deadon
sweet
spot
where
the
hops
are
faded
but
still
a
balancing
presence
against
the
potential
for
over
sweetness
the
arctic
devil

i
had
a
while
back
at
2
years
pulled
this
off

decent

sweet

hint

the
style
of
an
american

mouth
feel

crisp
with
an
average
carbonation

tastes
of

strong
sweet

strong

slight

and
hint
of

acidity
overall
strong
body
but
well
blended
overall
starting
to
break
into
the
barleywine
style
this
one
was
fantastic
to
start
off
with
they
said
that
alaskan
brewing
cos
tradition
with
this
barley
wine
is
to
lager
the
kegs
in
a
local
gold
mine
interesting
the
drinkability
was
unreal
as
i
had
3
of
these
while
it
was
complexed
and
full
flavored
mid
way
through
the
last
cup
i
started
to
feel
very
buzzed
and
with
this
ended
my
journey
schlaflys
bottleworks
o
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
a
treat
to
have
on
tap
d
the
nice
caramel
malt
sweetness
is
supported
by
the
alcohol
and
hop
finish
that
really
dries
out
this
beer
i
liked
this
id
like
to
have
it
dead
fresh
as
i
prefer
my
barleywines
with
a
healthy
hop
presence
but
even
as
is
this
was
good
theres
something
underneath
the
hops
that
feels
almost
oaky
but
its
hard
to
work
it
out
from
the
power
of
the
rest
of
the
beer
its
vaguely
disappointing
because
alaskan
seems
to
do
better
balancing
their
beers
than
theyve
done
with
their
barley
wine
ale
the
end
effect
is
that
the
beer
tastes
too
simple
and
too
heavy
on
the
hops
for
my
tastes
thats
not
to
say
i
couldnt
finish
the
bottle
you
barely
realize
theres
alcohol
in
this
beer
at
all
its
so
well
hidden
still
one
bottle
is
a
bit
much
for
one
person
and
it
might
be
best
split
between
friends
over
dinner
drinkability
i
didnt
care
for
this
as
much
as
others
i
think
it
would
benefit
quite
a
bit
from
cellaring
as
i
popped
mine
fresh
and
it
seemed
too
tight
id
like
to
try
a
twoyearold
bottle
one
of
these
days
great
drinking
and
i
can
sort
of
get
an
idea
of
how
well
this
beer
style
gets
with
age
now
boy
i
am
craving
some
stinky
cheese
or
any
good
cheese
to
go
with
this
right
now
i
think
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
this
vintage
reminds
me
a
lot
of
sunturn
brew
which
i
also
thoroughly
enjoyed
if
you
have
this
vintage
near
you
id
recommend
grabbing
it
i
really
want
to
see
what
this
years
tastes
like
good
to
see
both
the
alaskan
breweries
i
like
making
awesome
barleywines
this
beer
has
aged
very
well
thus
far
alaskan
is
an
amazing
barley
wine
that
does
it
right
well
under
the
radar
superb
nice
dark
red
mahogany
in
color
but
weak
head
and
even
less
lacing
great
nose
intensely
fruity
killer
taste
if
youre
into
malt
bombs
a
bit
sweet
but
still
really
tasty
might
want
to
pass
on
it
if
youre
a
hophead
since
there
are
so
many
other
barleywines
that
cater
to
hopheads
ultimately
i
would
say
its
slightly
unbalanced
toward
the
sweet
end
of
the
scale
and
could
actually
use
a
bit
more
bitter
hops
through
the
middle
but
still
a
great
brew
and
highly
drinkable
pours
a
reddishamber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
before
fading
into
a
thin
collar
a
few
spots
of
lacing
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
nose
exhibits
a
great
deal
of
fruity
complexity
along
with
some
caramel
light
booze
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
quite
captivating
with
layers
of
brown
sugar
and
fruits
intermingling
good
light
cherry
presence
and
a
bit
of
a
date
character
as
well
mouthfeel
is
really
really
rich
and
creamy
with
a
good
slightlyboozy
finish
really
drinkable
this
has
aged
gracefully
note
this
would
make
an
excellent
addition
to
anyones
cellar
including
mine
i
will
be
buying
at
least
3
more
bottles
for
aging
i
can
only
imagine
how
much
better
this
can
get
with
some
age
on
it
d
overall
a
little
to
sugary
sweet
for
my
liking
but
not
cloying
or
unbalanced
by
any
means
weak
nose
but
it
has
a
smooth
flavor
profile
that
is
nicely
balanced
overall
a
great
barleywine
that
i
think
would
benefit
from
more
aging
thanks
bro
for
another
great
beer
english
style
with
american
heft
not
my
favorite
style
barleywine
but
a
nice
winter
warmer
maybe
all
the
better
if
enjoyed
on
a
cold
alaskan
night
exponentially
hoppier
while
maintaining
balance
lots
of
carbonation
big
flavors
really
tasty
fresh
d
this
barleywine
was
perfect
for
the
0
degree
night
i
drank
it
on
it
has
nice
warmth
and
nice
complexity
for
a
cold
winters
night
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
brew
if
you
like
the
style
not
the
best
representation
of
the
style
but
a
good
one
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
barleywine
not
a
good
starter
barleywine
d
well
id
drink
this
every
day
if
i
could
love
barley
wines
and
i
love
this
one
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
that
just
tickles
the
tongue
and
keeps
the
beer
from
being
syrupy
the
abv
keeps
this
a
sipper
though
alaskan
i
regret
ever
making
fun
of
you
three
cheers
drink
heard
great
things
about
this
beer
was
anxious
to
try
it
glad
i
did
wasnt
let
down
i
can
see
why
it
won
awards
dvery
drinkable
for
a
10
7
cant
say
enough
about
the
complexities
that
dwell
within
after
letting
it
warm
up
it
does
have
a
better
nose

it
still

taste
most
of

still
a
good
effort
by
alaskan

co
and
worth
a
try
this
is
the
2009
version
i
think
it
could
use
another
year
or
two
of
sitting
before
consumption

i
would
appear
to
be
correct
rich
intense
dark

aromas
blended
with
a
little
booze
very
warm
creamy
mildly
carbonated
body
suits
the
flavors
nicely
very
rich
smooth
hop
and
malt
characters
it
has
characteristics
of
sierra
nevadas
big
foot
but
darker
though
not
sweeter
you
can
tell
from
the
aging
processes
that
this
beer
had
some
more
hop
character
when
it
was
fresh
however
its
not
a
bad
thing
the
overall
flavor
character
is
mild
although
still
pretty
good
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
barleywines
because
its
not
this
hop
bomb
with
a
malt
back
bone
that
makes
a
22oz
serving
rather
hard
to
finish
this
one
is
ive
had
this
fresh
and
liked
it
a
lot
im
glad
i
noticed
the
vintage
date
on
this
beer
a
year
is
not
overkill
for
aging
this
beer
it
has
mellowed
out
nicely
but
any
long
and
it
might
be
too
mellow
mouthfeel
is
rich
with
a
warming
alcohol
presence
drinkability
is
very
good
for
this
strong
a
beer
a
slow
sipper
to
be
sure
but
still
very
drinkable
one

my
favorite
barleywines

snifter
a
dark
ruby
red
with
a
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
to
a
crown
with
some
though
minimal
lacing
smell
was
very
malty
with
a
good
range
of
malts
primarily
caramel
malts
with
a
definite
alcohol
presence
taste
is
very
similar
with
the
alcohol
playing
a
good
presence
good
feel
smooth
with
light
carbonation
and
a
nice
alcohol
warming
overall
a
great
barleywine
d
a
sipper
cheers
well
balanced
the
malthop
balance
has
a
nw
bent
to
it
which
is
a
nice
touch
subtley
unique
and
well
worth
a
try
you
know
for
every
alaskan
brew
i
dislike
theres
one
that
kicks
total
ass
another
of
the
pilot
series
along
with
the
baltic
porter
this
is
a
huge
malty
bourbony
yummy
ale
with
10
4
abv
and
the
alcohol
isnt
even
apparent
til
yave
had
a
few
that
is
smooth
and
robust
and
just
freaking
awesome
but
pricey
at
7
99bomber
definitely
find
it
and
drink
it
mouth
feel
is
creamy
and
medium
carbonated
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
have
a
feeling
this
one
has
mellowed
a
little
but
the
bitterness
is
still
pretty
strong
in
the
finish
overall
a
nice
barleywine
there
should
be
very
little
speculating
that
this
barleywine
will
age
well
the
hardest
part
about
it
is
the
amount
of
willpower
you
can
muster
while
this
beer
is
in
your
cellar
a
sure
pick
for
the
barleywine
lover
or
anyone
that
is
into
laying
down
beer
overall
pretty
cool
to
try
any
beers
from
alaska
i
wasnt
completely
disappointed
impression
a
superb
barleywine
cant
recommend
it
highly
enough
beer
poured
a
reddishbrown
with
a
tan
head
that
is
leaving
lacing
behind
nose
is
quite
nice
sweet
malt
raisins
subtle
floral
hops
taste
is
very
well
balainced
malt
backbone
with
raisins
wood
trace
of
melon
with
a
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
medium
bodied
nicely
mellowed
with
age
drinkability
is
dangerously
good
abv
is
not
detectable
this
is
a
wonderful
sipper
for
a
105
degree
day
super
userfriendly
barley
wine
here
very
tasty
stuff
and
not
a
harsh
thing
about
it
a
beer
i
will
eagerly
buy
again
d
pretty
good
barleywine
from
alaskan
brewing
im
glad
i
have
a
extra
bottle
waiting
d
very
high
points
for
me
given
the
style
and
given
the
abv
this
should
be
a
very
slow
drinking
beer
it
isnt
awesome
dark
reddish
color
with
beautiful
ruby
highlights
and
a
creamy
tan
head
nice
piney
hops
on
the
nose
along
with
caramel
malt
and
a
little
vanilla
flavors
of
caramel
toffee
dark
fruits
and
maybe
some
cocoa
this
is
a
very
malty
barley
wine
solid
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
drinkability
is
up
there
this
is
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
had
in
quite
some
time
ill
buy
a
bottle
the
next
time
i
see
one
excellent
beer
this
is
a
quite
drinkable
beer
for
the
rich
intense
flavors
i
am
very
happy
to
come
across
a
2008
and
hopefully
will
be
able
to
pick
up
a
bit
more
d
its
a
pretty
good
deal
at
6
im
not
sure
id
pick
it
up
again
fresh
its
not
doing
a
lot
for
me
and
i
dont
have
the
resources
to
cellar
one
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
vintage
2007
purchased
from
the
now
defunct
liquid
solutions
a
few
years
ago
uncapped
and
poured
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
the
barleywine
appears
a
clear
crimson
amber
color
with
a
good
two
fingers
of
fluffy
tan
foam
the
head
leaves
a
decent
lace
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
sweet
red
cherries
plums
molasses
candied
dark
fruits
brown
sugar
raisins
light
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
notes
toast
caramel
sweetness
maybe
some
prunes
great
body
and
carbonation
for
the
style
and
vintage
not
much
alcohol
heat
to
speak
of
at
this
point
pretty
nice
overall
with
a
bit
of
time
on
it
bitter
from
ample
hops
as
it
first
hits
my
tongue
but
soon
enough
a
thick
rich
malt
sweetness
engulfs
the
palate
washing
away
much
of
the
bitterness
the
malt
sweetness
doesnt
completely
dominate
the
bitterness
as
there
is
just
enough
to
temper
the
malt
and
keep
it
from
becoming
overly
cloying
there
is
a
lingering
herbal
almost
menthol
note
as
well
as
a
firm
bitterness
the
malt
sweetness
accentuates
flavors
of
candied
citrus
peel
concentrated
red
currants
as
well
as
toasted
toothsome
whole
grain
malt
flavors
as
the
beer
warms
more
toasted
grain
notes
come
through
there
is
a
touch
of
caramelized
lightly
toasted
marshmallow
flavor
here
that
is
quite
nice
without
being
too
sweet
thick
and
chewy
but
without
being
cloying
a
really
great
barley
wine
time
has
been
kind
i
really
enjoyed
the
subtle
chocolate
component
in
this
beer
really
brought
everything
together
excellent
overall
an
alright
beer
with
potential
well
balanced
will
get
much
better
with
time
needs
to
mellow
and
blend
for
sure
drinkability
pretty
damn
solid
barleywine
this
ones
more
than
a
year
old
but
could
probably
sit
a
while
longer
still
its
a
little
hot
alcohol
wise
and
slightly
medicinal
but
the
big
sweet
malt
load
really
shines
through
and
is
balanced
by
residual
hoppiness
nice
beer
viscous
and
full
body
coats
my
mouth
and
lingers
for
a
long
time
letting
the
flavors
develop
as
heavy
and
high
abv
as
it
is
a
bomber
is
quite
a
bit
to
get
through
for
one
person
alaskan
nailed
its
barleywine
this
is
a
beer
im
going
to
get
again
im
glad
i
let
this
age
but
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
drinking
one
fresh
i
also
think
it
would
do
great
cellaring
for
a
couple
more
years
o
not
a
very
well
balanced
beer
the
flavors
dont
come
through
clearly
and
lead
to
off
flavors
great
barleywine
a
classic
perfect
with
a
year
and
a
half
of
age
d
not
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
it
may
be
a
10
4
but
it
sips
more
like
a
15
or
so
also
theres
something
about
the
whiskey
notes
and
spearmint
that
while
interesting
dont
seem
to
settle
entirely
well
with
the
rest
of
the
brew
at
least
not
to
me
this
is
a
very
good
one
and
it
aged
well
i
never
had
it
fresh
since
this
was
my
only
bottle
but
considering
the
still
present
heat
would
not
open
a
fresh
bottle
d
drinkability
is
good
given
the
fact
that
this
is
such
a
big
beer
it
is
a
sipper
but
i
have
no
problem
working
on
a
bottle
over
the
course
of
an
evening
i
cant
say
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
it
does
work
well
with
the
other
robust
flavors
going
on
two
thumbs
up
for
alaskan
brewing
co
s
barley
wine
i
have
a
feeling
ill
be
hunting
this
one
down
again
drinkability
complexity
usually
comes
at
a
price
with
this
one
its
a
huge
amount
of
booze
even
after
a
year
of
aging
this
ones
hot
though
its
also
bold
gripping
vicelike
almost
i
finished
it
surprisingly
quickly
and
its
complexity
had
be
coming
back
for
more
aged
gouda
held
its
own
against
this
one
though
it
was
quite
the
epic
battle
at
10
4
its
not
the
most
drinkable
thing
in
the
world
but
as
far
as
beers
at
this
abv
go
its
up
there
high
up
there
a
definite
recommendation
id
like
to
try
this
one
both
fresh
and
with
a
few
more
years
of
age
on
it
unsure
how
far
it
would
carry
but
i
imagine
the
2007
vintages
are
drinking
pretty
sweetly
right
around
now
those
guys
at
alaskan
know
what
they
are
doing
this
is
a
10
40abv
beer
that
drinks
like
its
a
6
0abv
beer
it
doesnt
seem
anywhere
near
as
big
as
it
is
as
a
result
i
find
this
one
to
be
very
drinkable
also
while
it
certainly
does
have
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
to
it
it
is
also
very
nicely
balanced
and
not
cloying
at
all
d
alcohol
in
this
one
is
pretty
high
at
10
4
not
at
all
hot
but
definitely
noticeable
and
is
taking
its
toll
on
me
excellent
balance
for
a
barleywine
not
overly
hoppy
or
sweet
quite
enjoyable
as
a
final
beer
for
the
evening
before
heading
to
bed
wish
i
had
this
thought
in
mind
before
having
one
so
early
very
very
good
barleywine
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
as
one
person
mentioned
at
the
tasting
we
had
this
at
there
really
is
nothing
whatsoever
to
detract
from
this
beer
very
well
done
impressive
d
a
fantastic
barleywine
w
a
little
age
and
has
an
almost
sherrylike
tinge
w
2
yrs
on
it
much
like
an
english
barleywine
this
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
the
strength
a
pleasure
to
taste
drinkability
definitely
a
winter
beer
here
lots
of
abv
to
keep
you
warm
haha
enjoyable
but
there
are
better
barley
wines
on
the
market
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
the
beer
pours
very
clear
a
very
sweet
smelling
beer
with
some
piney
hops
in
the
aroma
as
well
flavor
is
a
mix
of
dark
fruit
with
some
hops
and
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
warming
a
big
beer
that
is
definitely
a
sipper
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
its
strength
but
not
something
you
could
have
more
than
one
of
d
very
excellent
brew
here
d
big
beer
but
for
the
style
my
kind
of
barelywine
even
though
alaskan
barley
wine
ale
isnt
as
good
as
midnight
sun
arctic
devil
nothing
not
named
old
ruffian
is
either
this
is
a
fantastic
big
beer
that
ages
with
the
best
of
them
if
you
have
the
opportunity
buy
multiple
bottles
thats
what
i
plan
to
do
kind
of
hard
to
describe
the
flavors
in
this
one
very
malty
with
large
amounts
of
sweet
candied
prune
juice
and
other
dark
fruits
somewhat
boozy
but
not
bad
for
being
10
4
still
i
would
have
to
say
it
is
on
the
cloying
side
as
far
as
american
barley
wines
this
would
be
in
the
lower
tier
for
myself
pours
a
dark
amber
bordering
on
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
big
fluffy
beige
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lace
on
the
way
down
smells
of
citrus
hops
caramel
toffee
alcohol
some
dark
fruit
hidden
in
the
back
as
well
tastes
of
caramel
up
front
some
dark
fruits
in
there
quickly
before
the
hop
bite
hits
which
segues
to
a
bit
of
alcohol
burn
and
bitter
hoppy
aftertaste
mouth
is
sticky
and
sweet
carbonation
is
moderate
the
body
is
pretty
thick
its
a
good
malty
barleywine
although
still
a
little
hot
if
the
alcohol
tones
done
a
bit
this
one
would
be
great
maybe
in
a
year
or
two
i
might
have
the
opportunity
to
revisit
this
is
a
well
aboveaverage
barleywine
that
exhibits
all
the
characteristics
of
a
good
bw
without
knocking
me
off
my
feet
with
any
of
them
the
alcohol
is
a
little
more
evident
than
i
would
like
which
along
with
the
sweetness
limits
the
drinkability
a
tad
notes
either
barleywines
arent
my
thing
right
now
or
im
on
a
rash
of
notsogood
ones
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
with
a
small
white
ehad
and
good
carbonation
nose
is
alcohol
chocolate
and
fruit
evident
taste
is
also
complex
with
deep
malt
flavors
of
fig
chocolate
leather
smoke
and
other
dark
ripened
fruits
pretty
good
barleywine
all
around
mouthfeel
is
very
full
without
being
chewy
good
drinkability
except
for
the
abv
this
and
the
smoked
porter
are
my
favorites
from
alaskan
what
the
heck
dunno
how
time
would
even
help
this
one
pours
a
dark
ruby
hued
amber
color
with
a
full
finger
foamy
light
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
to
surface
leaving
spotty
patterns
of
belgian
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
classic
substantial
malty
sweet
butterscotch
caramel
and
hoppy
high
notes
the
mouth
feel
is
adequately
carbonated
full
bodied
creamy
and
tangy
full
flavored
the
nose
and
tastes
are
similar
and
complimentary
a
purebred
sipper
and
really
fine
example
of
style
the
10
4
abv
is
integrated
as
well
as
the
best
in
style
highly
recommended
i
prefered
the
07
by
far
i
would
age
this
for
at
least
2
years
d
very
drinkable
even
for
the
style
which
many
find
to
be
a
bit
harsh
i
would
recommend
this
to
even
a
nonbeer
drinker
sampled
at
the
west
coast
brewfest
had
two
samples
of
this
and
they
were
big
so
i
decided
to
review
it
poured
a
brown
chocolate
color
with
a
nice
14
inch
light
brown
head
laces
slowly
and
mostly
clear
nice
legs
smells
of
sweet
malt
ethanol
and
caramel
strong
alcohol
and
fruit
malt
flavor
cherries
sweet
barley
malt
ethanol
and
a
hoppy
bitterness
that
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
full
bodied
but
not
heavy
or
syrupy
drinks
well
fruit
flavors
come
forward
as
it
warms
which
i
like
drinkability
par
for
the
style
overall
a
solid
barleywine
i
was
happy
that
the
hops
were
pretty
faded
not
the
most
complex
of
barleywines
but
not
much
to
complain
about
this
beer
improved
tremendously
as
it
warmed
up
the
only
knock
i
have
was
that
i
wished
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thicker
d
although
the
alcohol
isnt
as
well
hidden
as
other
barleywines
this
one
hits
all
the
notes
right
on
im
quite
impressed
with
this
beer
id
recommend
it
most
definitely
cushy
moderately
viscous
texture
just
the
right
number
of
nice
tiny
bubbles
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
this
disappears
from
the
glass
way
too
fast
22
oz
2008
fairly
dark
amber
pour
with
a
limited
off
white
head
a
ring
remains
throughout
with
some
lacing
aromas
are
sweet
malt
toffee
yellow
raisins
some
booziness
just
a
hint
of
pineycitrus
hops
flavor
is
a
good
sweet
malty
mix
of
caramel
toffee
with
some
citrus
pine
as
well
just
a
little
hint
of
sour
at
first
but
this
disappears
and
is
gone
as
it
warms
a
bit
an
interesting
sweet
hoppy
finish
warming
with
a
barrellike
presence
a
nice
malt
inclined
barleywine
2nd
good
one
ive
had
from
alaskan
this
brewery
has
not
disappointed
me
at
all
recently
killing
cheers
taste
is
creamy
prunes
raisins
some
roasted
nuts
caramel
end
is
dry
and
nicely
bitter
good
drinkability
for
the
strength
of
this
one
a
good
sipper
many
thanks
to
sparky27
for
sending
this
along
im
upping
my
smell
rating
because
the
aromas
are
much
more
pleasing
to
me
this
year
it
doesnt
smell
like
a
dipa
this
time
this
is
a
strong
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
this
beer
won
first
place
in
the
tasting
and
it
is
easy
to
see
why
great
citrus
flavor
and
nicely
balanced
by
the
sweet
malt
bottle
poured
a
deep
coper
color
ale
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
light
citrus
hops
with
some
sweet
malt
taste
is
also
dominated
by
sweet
malt
with
some
light
dry
fruit
and
a
dry
bitter
and
citrusy
finish
courtesy
of
some
west
coast
hops
body
was
about
average
for
the
style
with
some
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
well
made
and
even
though
i
prefer
my
barleywine
with
some
limited
hops
i
thought
this
example
was
very
well
balanced
and
it
is
definitively
one
that
i
would
like
to
try
again
i
could
deal
with
a
bit
less
straightahead
sweetness
maybe
dial
back
the
crystal
malts
just
a
tad
and
up
the
hop
profile
but
even
as
it
is
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
id
enjoy
it
more
if
i
could
warm
up
with
it
on
a
cold
late
winterearly
spring
evening
not
in
socal
decent
beer
ill
let
the
other
one
rest
in
the
basement
until
20102011
give
it
another
whirl
the
flavor
diverts
from
the
fruity
goodness
of
the
aroma
and
backs
the
caramel
malts
with
some
light
chocolate
notes
and
big
layers
of
spicy
warming
booze
very
little
heat
to
the
alcohol
and
the
earthen
hops
are
generally
mild
across
the
palate
a
lingering
boozy
sweetness
combines
with
a
peppy
carbonation
level
that
livens
up
the
finish
body
is
on
the
thicker
side
of
medium
slightly
chewy
and
quite
smooth
all
in
all
a
fantastic
american
barleywine
worthy
of
the
alaskan
brewing
co
name
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
to
medium
full
the
finish
is
bitter
and
lasting
the
barleywine
is
a
tad
rough
around
the
edge
i
think
that
some
age
on
this
beer
will
do
wonders
the
beer
is
good
right
now
and
very
flavorful
from
a
22
oz
bottle
this
poured
a
rich
and
very
clear
garnet
color
with
a
fat
white
head
and
good
heavy
lacing
nose
of
alcohol
with
ripe
fruit
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
flavor
is
of
caramel
malts
and
some
citrus
hops
but
generally
this
is
sweet
a
little
bitterness
in
the
finish
i
have
a
feeling
this
will
get
better
with
age
but
it
is
good
now
as
well
d
a
touch
bitter
but
decently
good
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
smooth
with
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
very
good
edit
had
it
on
tap
with
some
more
age
better
for
sure
still
needs
some
time
much
less
green
apple
flavor
however
thanks
to
my
wife
for
picking
this
bottle
up
for
me
as
part
of
my
trying
a
beer
from
every
state
she
knows
im
a
big
barleywine
fan
so
this
was
cool
to
say
the
least
i
found
this
brew
to
be
a
solid
american
barleywine
with
good
bitterness
citric
hops
buoyed
by
a
rich
caramel
toffee
body
with
dark
fruit
undertones
full
bodied
smooth
and
very
drinkable
worth
trying
d
i
actually
had
trouble
finishing
this
its
not
bad
i
just
thought
it
would
have
been
better
in
a
much
smaller
serving
i
look
forward
to
trying
it
again
but
maybe
after
it
has
been
in
the
cellar
for
2
or
3
years
to
take
the
edge
off
of
it
drinkability
if
i
wanted
a
hybrid
englishamerican
mix
this
would
be
my
go
to
beer
i
will
always
be
more
fond
of
the
english
style
which
the
07
version
was
but
this
is
quite
good
one
of
the
best
barleywines
not
considering
style
that
i
have
had
mouthfeeldrinkability
even
with
the
slight
heat
that
is
present
this
stuff
is
incredibly
drinkable
the
smooth
enjoyable
flavor
and
rich
texture
make
it
so
22
ounce
bottle
acquired
in
a
trade
with
hoppiness
last
year
2007
vintage
excited
this
was
finally
bottled
and
is
going
to
remain
that
way
split
with
my
dad
tonight
poured
into
my
flying
dog
imperial
pint
glass
color
is
pure
copper
with
a
nice
one
inch
creamy
beige
head
that
lasts
over
five
minutes
nice
lacing
for
a
while

grapefruit
toffee
and
mild
booze
starts
off
with
some
dry

and

notes
sweet
caramel
and
berries
in
the
middle
finish
is
slightly
bitter
and
a
fading
booze
bite
in
the
aftertaste
gets
both
sweeter
and
hotter
as
it
warms
malt
was
prominent
and
added
a
silky
presence
at
times
sweet
slightly
dry
boozy
and
fruity
mouthfeel
medium
to
full
bodied
on
the
lighter
side
for
carbonation
taste
lingered
could
have
drank
the
bottle
which
is
good
for
a
beer
over
ten
percent
not
too
sweet
or
filling
larger
hop
presence
helped
that
out
liked
this
better
fresh
the
first
time
i
had
it
but
it
would
be
interesting
to
try
this
vintage
another
four
or
five
years
down
the
road
was
not
at
the
toronado
barleywine
festival
but
this
seems
to
be
worthy
of
its
gold
medal
and
have
heard
it
is
even
better
on
tap
one
of
the
better
barleywines
i
have
tasted
of
late
quite
solid
not
a
bad
value
for
the
eight
dollar
price
tag
either
will
be
drinking
again
hopefully
they
decide
to
barrel
age
some
of
this
in
the
future
recommended
j
poured
hazy
copper
with
a
frothy
white
head
thick
sticky
lacing
that
took
several
swigwashes
to
break
through
very
sweet
with
caramel
and
dried
figs
some
piney
hops
but
lighter
than
say
the
stone
old
guardian
i
had
later
smooth
mouthfeel
kind
of
sticky
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
i
barely
noticed
it
until
seeing
the
10
on
the
label
very
sweet
barleywine
not
as
much
hops
as
the
nose
advertised
loads
of
caramel
grain
and
sugar
tended
to
build
up
in
your
mouth
could
have
used
a
bit
more
bitterness
still
very
good
d
very
nice
and
drinkable
it
really
did
taste
like
a
fresh
bottle
i
wish
i
had
a
fresh
bottle
to
compare
this
to
really
nice
beer
md
wow
this
brew
is
smooth
especially
for
a
barley
wine
but
not
to
smooth
to
take
away
from
its
style
it
is
a
good
barley
wine
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
with
dinner
d
i
dont
know
that
id
search
this
out
again
easy
enough
to
drink
but
not
totally
enjoyable
i
was
hoping
for
a
lil
better
d
an
interesting
barleywine
from
alaskan
needs
a
bit
of
age
on
it
right
now
not
entirely
what
i
was
expecting
22
oz
is
a
lot
to
drink
of
this
style
id
probably
buy
it
again
if
i
could
get
12
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
this
beer
was
very
light
for
a
barleywine
though
as
i
had
no
problem
putting
down
my
half
of
the
22oz
last
night
but
this
came
up
a
bit
short
for
me
considering
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
long
time
perhaps
its
the
way
i
process
barleywines
theres
no
doubt
alaskan
brewing
is
a
place
i
want
to
revisit
perhaps
aging
this
one
is
a
good
call
nice
and
smooth
with
an
alcohol
warming
finish
i
would
have
this
again
overall
an
excellent
and
recommended
barleywine
poured
into
a
stone
old
guardian
barleywine
glass
its
a
nice
amber
with
very
little
head
that
leaves
a
small
lace
smell
is
brown
sugar
caramel
slight
pine
and
amarillo
hops
taste
is
more
like
and
engish
barleywine
than
american
strong
malt
base
of
sugary
caramel
very
light
hops
for
an
american
barleywine
but
this
leaves
a
void
in
the
taste
progression
that
the
alcohol
fills
nicely
its
not
too
harsh
though
no
burn
at
all
i
will
admit
that
american
barleywines
like
old
guardian
have
destroyed
my
palate
for
well
crafted
smooth
beers
like
this
pours
a
rich
amber
under
a
thick
tan
head
the
nose
has
big
candy
malts
toffee
dark
fruits
and
citrusy
hops
the
hops
are
a
bit
more
prevailent
in
the
taste
still
a
solid
bready
malt
and
sweet
fruitcandy
presence
though
well
balanced
with
a
nice
body
thats
what
she
said
for
sure
one
of
the
better
beer
to
come
out
of
alaskan
brewing
will
age
very
well
drinkability
definitely
a
sipper
a
22oz
bottle
is
best
shared
with
a
friend
already
a
great
beer
but
i
think
this
would
shine
even
brighter
with
some
age
on
it
delicious
rich
buttery
this
beer
is
drinking
very
well
already
but
i
fully
expect
it
to
get
even
better
with
age
its
just
a
great
american
barleywine
the
malt
is
strong
and
sweet
without
any
off
flavors
theres
a
lot
of
caramel
and
a
lot
of
barley
flavor
the
hops
are
still
strong
but
less
bitter
than
flavorful
the
hops
come
through
piney
and
maybe
citric
or
floral
its
hard
to
tell
exactly
its
relatively
close
to
old
guardian
but
its
been
awhile
since
i
had
one
of
those
the
feel
is
exquisite
full
velvety
warming
alcohol
warms
the
mouth
and
brightens
the
flavors
there
are
some
notes
of
honey
but
it
could
be
my
imagination
its
a
delicious
beer
a
satisfying
barleywine
d
for
a
big
barleywine
this
beer
packs
plenty
of
drinkability
great
mix
of
flavors
and
aromas
combine
with
an
appropriate
mouthfeel
i
was
in
a
situation
where
having
a
second
beer
would
be
inadvisable
otherwise
id
have
had
a
second
and
maybe
a
third
well
done
d
one
of
my
more
favorite
barleywines
to
date
price
was
a
little
steep
but
in
the
end
very
worth
it
i
can
imagine
this
one
probably
gets
amazing
with
age
so
i
will
be
back
to
grab
one
for
the
closet
playlist
for
this
included
blue
cheer
solace
king
crimson
crossed
out
the
norman
haines
band
and
buzzoven
d
easy
to
drink
almost
too
easy
the
body
is
a
bit
light
for
a
barleywine
odd
with
the
sugary
over
undertones
would
like
more
complexity
on
this
it
should
age
well
i
hope
but
fresh
this
is
a
bit
disappointing
would
like
less
sugarphenols
and
more
of
a
malt
presence
overall
a
nice
barley
wine
its
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
excellent
brew
well
done
alaskan
big
smooth
mouthfeel
full
but
tempered
by
hops
and
the
alcohol
basically
this
one
is
a
bit
too
hot
lay
it
down
if
you
want
im
sure
it
will
age
quite
gracefully
drinks
really
easy
for
the
style
abv
does
skews
a
bit
towards
the
english
style
imo
great
barley
wine
wont
satisfy
most
hopheads
im
guessing
fairly
clear
bright
red
with
a
slightly
orange
hue
it
had
a
full

of

a

this
is
a

and
i

a

more

will
mellow
the

further
and
make
it
even

thanks
tayner
for
this

enjoyable
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
but
as
many
of
this
style
do
it
tends
to
get
seemingly
heavier
as
the
cloying
begins
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
as
a
true
sipper
or
a
session

mouthfeeldrinkability
its
medium
bodied
but
very
close
to
being
thick
carbonation
is
very
well
done
its
no

a
sipping
beer
but
its
easier
to
drink
than
one
might
expect
due
to
its
hefty
10
4
stature
ill
stop
and
one
bomber
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
alaskan
i
understand
that
this
the
first
time
this
beer
has
been
bottled
and
i
walk
away
impressed
perhaps
next
year
the
sweetness
could
be
toned
down
just
a
bit
and
really
drive
it
to
the
next
level
the
body
is
heavy
and
sugary
it
has
the
right
amount
of
co2
and
a
healthy
amount
of
bitterness
if
your
into
that
it
is
very
much
to
style
which
i
like
its
nice
to
see
a
brewery
do
something
the
way
it
was
meant
to
be
done
rather
than
trying
to
make
the
most
extreme

is
hidden
pretty
well
medium
body
well
rounded
brew
very
drinkable
another
pretty
tasty
brew
from
alaskan
bottom
line
this
is
a
very
good
american
bwsa
the
hops
and
the
malt
work
very
well
together
here
and
that
makes
for
a
fine
drinking
experience
well
worth
seeking
out
and
highly
recommended
maybe
a
couple
of
years
on
its
side
in
the
cellar
will
help
dry
her
out
pours
rich
maroon
with
a
slight
hazed
look
and
a
thin
beige
head
smell
is
very
fresh
with
dark
malty
sweetness
comin
in
along
with
balancing
hops
in
the
form
of
grassy
and
vegetal
notes
almost
taste
is
moderately
sweet
but
not
syrupy
at
all
and
balanced
by
the
grassy
hop
flavor
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
something
in
this
beer
seemed
a
bit
odd
to
me
and
once
i
got
vegetal
in
my
mind
i
couldnt
shake
that
and
enjoy
it
as
much
sticky
in
the
mouth
the
big
booze
is
not
a
player
in
this
one
big
my
rosy
cheeks
reminded
me
of
it
just
a
tad
harsh
i
bet
a
year
aging
would
have
made
this
world
class
stuff
pours
a
fairly
dark
ruby
brown
with
quite
a
decent
head
that
sticks
around
as
a
ring
swet
and
somewhat
hot
aromas
smells
honeyed
and
fruity
with
a
blend
of
red
and
black
fruit
like
a
good
cobbler
not
like
wine
fairly
complex
and
less
sweet
than
the
nose
suggests
there
is
still
some
sweetness
but
it
is
balanced
with
some
hop
bitterness
that
is
quite
citrusy
and
produces
a
long
bitter
aftertaste
tempered
by
some
fruity
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
slightly
tangy
finish
delicious
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
slight
heat
in
the
nose
is
not
evident
in
the
mouth
one
of
their
nicer
products
this
is
one
beer
i
wont
have
trouble
cellaring
for
another
612
months
seems
like
its
going
to
get
better
with
more
time
to
gel
glad
i
have
another
thanks
again
brian
cheers
i
was
happy
to
find
that
finishing
a
bottle
was
not
ever
a
chore
and
that
even
afterward
i
didnt
feel
logy
or
hazy
my
palate
was
still
feeling
fresh
a
very
nice
entry
medium
body
with
a
lower
amount
of
carbonation
a
bit
of
warming
from
the
alcohol
very
enjoyable
once
it
opened
up
a
bit
hops
are
still
big
in
the
mouth
but
the
malt
and
fruit
really
challenge
and
win
balancing
things
smoothly
making
this
a
creamy
drinkable
dried
fruit
enriched
barley
wine
some
fig
jam
comes
through
with
maple
soaked
dates
and
plumy
dark
ripeness
that
sneaks
in
there
hops
arent
as
fruity
in
the
mouth
but
are
very
resiny
with
piney
thick
bitterness
on
the
long
finish
pours
a
deep
brown
with
crimson
highlights
and
a
slight
head
nice
complex
nose
with
alcohol
chocolate
and
fruit
evident
taste
is
also
complex
with
deep
malt
flavors
of
fig
chocolate
leather
smoke
and
other
dark
ripened
fruits
rich
but
not
cloying
medium
full
with
a
smooth
luxurious
mouthfeel
slightly
resinous
alcohol
is
present
but
does
not
detract
from
the
drinkability
well
done
sirs
well
done
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
the
big
nugget
it
wont
be
the
last
damn
it
why
and
the
hell
did
we
not
get
this
brew
in
idaho
there
is
a
definite
market
for
big
barleywines
and
this
would
almost
certainly
be
the
best
i
would
buy
a
case
if
it
werent
for
fedex
and
ls
so
much
over
the
price
fo
the
bottles
beautiful
reddish
golden
color
when
held
up
to
a
light
enticing
aroma
very
balanced
flavor
sweet
up
front
but
nicely
backed
and
the

abv
doesnt
smack
you
in
the
face
drinkability
had
no
problem
finishing
the
22oz
bottle
had
to
pace
myself
actually
id
been
sitting
on
this
bottle
for
a
few
weeks
blessed
as
we
are
in
anchorage
with
great
brews
but
figured
i
better
sample
it
so
as
to
know
whether
to
stock
up
before
it
is
gone
fully
understand
why
it
won
a
gold
at
toronado
great
beer
please
excuse
my
deficiency
in
technical
description
im
learning
cheers
drinkability
a
fine
barleywine
at
the
moment
that
should
age
quite
nicely
and
only
improve
with
time
away
in
the
cellar
22oz
bottle
2007
edition
i
popped
the
crown
and
took
a
whiff
of
strong
green
leafy
hops
which
gave
way
to
fruit
and
a
little
alcohol
fumes
the
color
was
deep
ruby
red
in
my
snifter
with
an
initial
dirtywhite
head
that
quickly
faded
away
it
still
smells
kinda
hot
but
it
doesnt
taste
hot
it
has
a
hoppy
bitterness
that
is
somehow
perfectly
balanced
with
a
malty
sweetness
the
sweet
fruitiness
that
coats
my
tongue
is
quite
awesome
and
i
am
glad
i
shelled
out
the
9
for
this
bomber
d
good
but
still
seems
young
w
the
hoppiness
holding
too
much
of
the
attention
im
betting
age
will
be
excellent
to
this
beer
and
then
it
will
really
shine
does
get
more
balanced
as
it
warms
pours
very
dark
for
style
deep
mahogany
with
a
dense
ofwhite
head
very
clear
with
ruby
notes
aroma
is
wonderful
northwest
hops
upfront
very
fresh
dry
hopped
followed
closely
by
dark
malts
producing
some
chocolate
and
hints
of
coffee
aromas
flavor
follows
through
after
aroma
with
more
nw
hops
and
a
great
dark
chocolate
character
aftertaste
is
more
dark
chocolate
backed
by
more
nw
hops
body
is
pleasantly
full
great
americanstyle
barleywine
one
of
the
best
dark
brown
amber
almost
opaque
in
my
glass
but
held
up
to
the
sun
i
get
beautiful
red
rays
shining
through
smallish
dark
head
that
is
quickly
gone
smells
like
bwine
darn
it
malty
and
bitter
hoppy
you
know
but
then
well
in
the
mouth
its
not
bad
not
at
all
but
i
think
its
an
i2pa
with
too
much
color
i
dont
know
life
is
complicated
its
beer
its
decent
its
not
what
im
looking
for
almost
english
bwine
with
the
syrupy
sweetness
but
much
more
bitter
than
one
of
those
but
not
as
bitter
as
a
merican
bwine
so
too
sweet
not
quite
the
body
not
quite
the
bitterness
of
the
ideal
merican
bwine
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
a
very
good
but
not
great
barleywine
one
that
ill
occasionly
shell
out
the
to
enjoy
again
drinkability
is
a
bit
below
average
right
now
a
nice
barelywine
but
something
about
it
was
just
a
bit
to
thick
and
heavyhanded
to
really
pick
up
much
steam
this
bomber
was
a
good
2
53
hr
affair
still
theres
enough
potential
that
im
gonna
have
to
cellar
a
few
and
see
how
long
i
can
hold
out
d
the
label
correctly
states
enjoy
now
or
age
it
for
several
years
the
first
sip
of
two
had
some
youthful
alcoholic
heat
but
from
that
point
on
it
was
mellow
smoothness
through
and
through
a
terrific
sipper
now
and
one
ill
be
holding
back
a
few
of
in
the
cellar
its
simply
a
must
try
barley
wine
overall
this
is
quite
enjoyable
but
not
quite
on
par
with
some
of
my
other
favorites
i
plan
to
grab
a
few
more
and
forget
about
them
for
a
handful
of
years
this
should
be
much
better
with
a
bit
of
age
behind
it
overall
a
great
barleywine
id
love
to
try
this
head
to
head
with
bigfoot
this
is
a
really
impressive
beer
ive
recently
seen
that
it
is
available
in
bottles
so
ill
be
enjoying
this
one
at
home
overall
a
delicious
delightful
outstanding
barleywine
and
one
that
ill
definitely
drink
again
hopefully
in
a
week
at
gabbf
its
almost
perfectly
balanced
and
has
the
warmth
hoppiness
and
assertiveness
of
american
barleywine
styles
with
the
deep
sweet
old
mustiness
of
english
styles
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
the
rubiest
of
ruby
tint
clear
the
head
is
nice
but
dissipates
relatively
fast
the
nose
is
of
dark
fruit
and
subtle
sweet
malt
with
a
great
balance
of
hop
the
taste
reflects
the
nose
sweet
and
malty
up
front
with
lots
of
sugar
and
dark
fruit
taste
hops
come
through
the
middle
clear
yet
subtle
and
not
very
bitter
hops
rise
through
the
finish
and
start
to
bitter
a
bit
on
the
finish
the
hop
bitterness
covers
the
inside
of
the
mouth
and
sweet
sugars
reside
on
the
lips
this
is
a
very
balanced
barleywine
that
deserves
alot
of
respect
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
quite
thick
and
chewy
syrupy
almost
defenitely
a
desert
beer
drinkability
is
quite
high
imo
as
the
balance
is
something
to
be
marveled
at
this
along
with
the
smoked
porter
are
unquestionably
imo
alaskan
brewings
best
offerings
so
glad
i
can
finally
put
a
case
in
the
cellar
i
wish
i
could
travel
forward
in
time
about
45
years
and
taste
one
get
it
get
it
now
they
say
this
is
a
nice
one
to
bottle
age
but
who
has
the
patience
for
that
this
stuff
is
so
good
so
mellow
so
gone
in
60
seconds
o
3
75
a
decent
little
barleywine
but
not
a
great
one
would
work
in
a
pinch
when
yours
craving
the
style
but
isnt
worth
taking
up
space
in
your
cellar
to
track
its
flavor
development
or
anything
this
was
the
2010
version
cant
say
ive
had
any
other
year
but
this
was
pretty
decent
very
nice
malty
finish
masked
high
abv
well
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
real
ale
truly
a
must
have
my
first
barleywine
and
i
do
like
6613
version
drank
123114
bottled
on
73114
consumed
121914
after
agitating
the
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
it
was
then
poured
into
a
tulip
at
60
degrees
it
poured
an
opaque
rustreddishorange
with
about
an
inch
of
creamy
offwhite
colored
head
that
dissipated
into
a
thin
film
leaving
nice
and
sticky
flecks
of
lacing
all
around
the
glass
smells
like
pear
apple
apricot
sweet
malts
and
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
medium
thick
and
creamy
mouth
feel
with
light
carbonation
and
its
definitely
a
sipper
i
taste
malty
sweetness
blended
with
ripe
pears
and
apricots
followed
by
a
mild
lingering
hint
of
toffee
with
mild
hop
bitterness
staying
on
the
palette
for
a
while
this
beer
is
less
than
5
months
old
and
the
hops
and
malts
work
together
nicely
but
i
can
imagine
this
beer
might
become
overly
sweet
with
too
much
age
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
it
blends
well
considering
that
its
11
5
overall
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
and
i
will
be
ageing
the
other
two
bottles
from
this
four
pack
o
i
probably
should
have
drank
one
of
these
a
few
years
ago
when
they
first
came
to
me
but
this
beer
is
drinking
really
well
flavors
are
good
and
its
aged
gracefully
hops
are
much
more
apparent
on
the
nose
than
on
the
palate
and
it
aged
gracefully
o
tasty
different
and
citrus
forward
cant
say
ive
had
a
barleywine
like
this
its
good
but
not
something
id
reach
for
often
this
beer
probably
isnt
getting
the
props
it
deserves
its
delicious
i
cant
speak
to
this
beer
flesh
but
a
year
and
four
months
have
aged
it
well
o
decent
american
barley
wine
not
bad
o
good
balanced
beer
its
borderline
too
sweet
for
me
but
they
loaded
it
up
on
hops
to
save
the
day
i
will
be
drinking
this
beer
again
dark
sugars
sticky
sweet
muted
flavors
this
one
may
be
past
its
sweet
spot
its
tasty
but
i
dont
think
its
amongst
the
top
barleywines
on
my
list
i
think
a
bottle
or
two
of
this
will
get
aged
for
a
year
or
more
high

got

all
around
great

flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
for
the
abv
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
from
my
tasting
notes
on
a
2012
vintage
i
know
barleywines
are
usually
better
with
some
age
but
the
word
on
sisyphus
is
it
is
incredible
fresh
since
it
is
made
with
a
load
of
hops
the
bottle
i
sampled
was
about
3
months
old
according
to
the
bottle
date
which
is
not
a
lot
of
aging
time
for
a
barleywine
the
pungent
citrus
hop
aroma
crept
out
of
the
bottle
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
top
the
beer
poured
a
copper
color
with
very
little
head
there
was
a
nice
citrus
grapefruit
hop
bitterness
at
the
front
that
quickly
dissipated
into
a
smooth
caramel
and
toffee
malt
body
it
had
a
full
mouthfeel
and
medium
to
full
body
that
you
would
expect
from
such
a
substantial
brew
with
no
harshness
and
not
overly
boozy
it
is
definitely
a
hoppy
barleywine
maybe
the
3
months
took
a
bit
of
the
hop
edge
and
bitterness
out
of
the
sisyphus
because
i
thought
it
was
just
the
right
amount
without
being
overly
biting
the
typical
barleywine
flavors
were
allowed
to
assert
themselves
and
play
nicely
with
the
grapefruit
hop
undertones
a
really
wonderful
brew
that
keeps
real
ale
on
the
forefront
of
the
texas
brewing
scene
rating
reflects
the
aged
variety
sometimes
i
really
enjoy
trying
a
beer
that
ive
never
heard
of
and
have
no
expectations
for
because
im
typically
a
sadistic
pessimist
and
will
often
go
into
new
unknown
beers
thinking
theyre
going
to
be
the
worst
thing
ive
ever
tasted
and
when
i
try
them
and
find
out
theyre
not
usually
the
case
then
its
even
more
of
a
treat
such
is
the
case
here
very
good
brew
that
id
have
again
if
it
were
available
to
me
ive
had
sisyphus
fresh
and
aged
up
to
5
years
both
are
very
delicious
sisyphus
is
a
fantastic
barleywine
with
years
on
it
sisyphus
is
a
very
special
treat
i
havent
had
a
fresh
one
but
this
is
an
incredible
beer
with
4
years
on
it
only
slight
oxidation
that
hardly
detracts
from
the
synergy
of
all
the
other
components
awesome
mouthfeel
that
demands
sipping
this
is
drinking
fantastic
right
now
and
seems
like
it
could
handle
a
couple
more
years
of
aging
all
around
impressive
barleywine
enjoyable
on
all
fronts
im
glad
i
took
the
chance
and
grabbed
this
local
gem
its
pretty
nice
the
beer
poured
a
good
amber
color
and
i
could
smell
the
hops
the
smell
had
a
fruit
tang
like
citrus
more
like
orange
than
grapefruit
i
could
taste
the
hops
i
could
not
pick
up
much
of
a
malt
taste
the
beer
had
a
creamy
feel
to
it
i
felt
very
little
alcohol
warmth
since
i
dont
like
american
barleywine
i
prefer
english
barleywine
when
i
get
barleywine
style
beers
i
probably
would
not
buy
this
again
if
you
are
someone
that
likes
american
barleywine
style
beers
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
try
out
since
it
matches
the
style
with
the
exception
of
alcohol
warmth
well
not
my
favorite
barleywine
but
a
significant
one
damn
thats
strong
tried
the
2012
and
first
try
was
less
than
favorable
as
the
alcohol
seemed
to
overwhelm
any
flavor
but
for
the
sour
hops
the
second
and
third
glass
not
the
same
night
however
changed
my
mind
seems
the
hops
tame
over
time
and
an
added
caramelized
or
sweet
note
balances
the
hops
but
make
no
mistake
the
punch
in
this
barley
wine
is
not
for
a
sisy
a
great
sipper
a
wonderful
barleywine
way
breadier
than
most
ive
tasted
o
a
solid
example
of
the
american
barleywine
im
really
just
not
subscribed
to
the
idea
that
they
are
worth
aging
though
thanks
for
the
chance
to
try
this
gtermi
pours
a
crystal
clear
medium
orange
with
a
thin
offwhite
foam
that
couldnt
keep
it
together
slight
wet
cardboard
notes
in
the
early
aroma
hint
at
oxidation
saltine
cracker
and
toffee
also
detecting
some
dark
fruity
esters
blackberry
in
the
cup
im
picking
up
citrus
fruits
caramel
lightly
toasted
bread
and
a
small
amount
of
butterscotch
in
the
background
touch
of
vegetal
in
the
finish
medium
in
body
carbonation
is
fairly
low
i
love
barleywines
this
is
a
solid
one
but
not
particularly
spectacular
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
i
bought
several
bottles
so
i
can
age
them
and
see
how
they
turn
out
with
time
o
very
good
barleywine
i
cannot
believe
the
abv
because
you
really
cannot
taste
it
throughout
it
only
has
that
nice
alcoholic
burn
to
it
that
indicates
that
its
there
a
lovely
barley
wine
overall
and
it
is
different
as
well
not
like
barefoot
that
has
that
hoppy
quality
to
it
this
is
much
sweeter
and
has
much
more
malt
present
i
will
definitely
be
getting
this
again
d
very
nice
for
a
barleywine
not
too
overpowering
to
be
drinkable
but
still
not
a
summer
afternoon
chugger
in
any
way
o
a
nice
mellow
sweet
slow
drinking
barleywine
very
smooth
though
that
might
be
the
age
a
little
bit
of
nice
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweetness
all
good
things
just
a
little
simple
thats
what
keeps
it
from
garnering
higher
numbers
i
enjoyed
it
overall
great
stuff
big
bold
balanced
and
flavorful
this
one
drank
away
far
too
easily
less
alcohol
burn
would
put
this
one
onto
another
planet
but
it
was
still
fantastic
if
you
get
the
chance
to
try
this
vintage
dont
hesitate
very
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
drink
this
one
kungfu
cheers
o
pretty
darn
drinkable
as
i
get
older
im
not
as
crazy
about
high
gravity
beers
as
i
used
to
be
this
one
is
a
very
nice
sipper
it
is
aggressive
but
pretty
balanced
ill
take
this
over
a
double
ipa
any
day
big
thanks
goes
out
to
lnashsig
for
sending
me
this
one
as
an
extra
in
a
past
trade
2010
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
boulevard
tulip
poured
a
deep
yelloworange
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
wood
and
sweet
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
caramel
hop
and
sweet
alcohol
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
i
really
enjoyed
the
aroma
on
this
one
as
it
was
spoton
for
the
style
and
quite
inviting
while
still
letting
you
know
that
it
packed
a
punch
the
flavor
seemed
to
follow
suit
but
didnt
really
do
anything
else
for
me
which
was
kind
of
a
letdown
there
was
a
nice
touch
of
sweetness
but
the
alcohol
presence
definitely
made
itself
known
in
it
which
hurt
the
overall
appeal
of
this
one
for
me
if
you
like
barleywines
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
try
this
one
overall
mild
mellow
high
drinkability
but
malt
isnt
very
complex
and
its
neither
spicy
nor
fruity
needs
something
to
kick
it
up
a
notch
worth
trying
but
i
dont
really
see
it
developing
much
over
time
ill
hang
on
to
one
and
see
if
it
proves
me
wrong
however
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
glass
bottled
on
3
23
12
this
pours
a
nice
copper
amber
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
the
smells
are
of
caramel
citrus
hops
alcohol
the
feel
is
almost
thick
nice
carbonation
the
taste
is
pretty
good
nice
amount
of
hops
and
grapefruit
along
with
a
nice
caramel
toffee
good
stuff
o
wonderful
beer
id
love
to
grab
a
few
more
of
these
to
age
and
compare
most
definitely
gonna
get
another
pack
for
celebrations
this
year
overall
a
really
nice
barleywine
that
holds
its
hop
character
very
well
the
2010
vintage
is
definitely
holding
up
nicely
and
drinking
well
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
the
hop
notes
fresh
must
be
very
nice
o
this
was
a
good
clean
barleywine
that
doesnt
get
too
introspective
but
also
stays
away
from
alcohol
burn
and
only
malt
worth
it
another
goody
captured
on
tap
at
the
whip
in
in
austin
texas
this
barleywine
is
a
solid
amber
color
slightly
hazed
with
a
modest
white
head
and
fair
lacing
the
aroma
offers
deep
rye
malt
with
hints
of
sweet
whiskey
very
nice
thick
cloying
rye
whiskey
jumps
out
on
the
palette
i
love
it
simple
and
nicely
balanced
with
vague
banana
bread
and
orange
subtleties
this
barleywine
approaches
full
bodied
with
peaceful
carbonation
with
a
calm
near
whiskeylike
feel
this
is
a
little
bit
of
a
different
take
on
barleywine
but
very
tasty
and
highly
recommended
88100
atmosphere
is
decent
not
much
to
look
at
but
nose
is
full
with
maple
malt
orange
and
a
hint
of
spice
full
thick
pungent
and
sweet
body
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
overall
pretty
damn
good
barley
wine
i
think
the
beer
has
just
the
right
amount
of
age
o
a
good
barleywine
that
has
enough
differences
from
others
to
make
it
interesting
i
think
this
would
age
really
well
maybe
the
astringency
in
the
taste
would
fade
thanks
to
texasclimber
for
this
sweet
extra
o
sweet
almost
like
candy
just
a
great
barleywine
reminds
me
of
hog
heaven
gonna
buy
more
to
drink
now
and
cellar
overall
a
great
barley
wine
and
its
consistently
good
too
the
09
and
10
were
excellent
too
i
think
these
will
benefit
from
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
nice
amber
color
nice
head
a
classic
barleywineimperial
mouthfeel
which
i
love
different
label
than
shown
in
picture
gray
foil
background
a
very
nice
barleywine
brewed
right
here
in
the
heart
of
texas
m
unusual
sharp
bite
in
finish
that
is
probably
from
brett
good
beer
and
thanks
to
friend
jax
poured
at
a
great
temperature
and
with
decent
cream
colored
fine
head
that
lasted
for
a
while
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
slightly
hazy
amber
aroma
is
malt
hop
yeast
fruit
caramel
flavors
like
nose
with
mild
carbonics
and
super
balanced
body
and
carbonation
are
perfect
finish
is
like
flavor
tapers
nicely
sooo
good
o
a
good
barley
wine
lots
of
interesting
tastes
in
this
one
i
would
be
interested
to
see
how
this
one
tastes
as
it
ages
even
longer
slightly
above
average
there
are
so
many
better
barleywines
out
there
i
couldnt
see
myself
reaching
for
this
too
often
wow
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
at
this
point
the
abv
is
well
hidden
and
the
beer
leans
sweet
but
is
not
cloying
by
any
means
a
little
hop
scrubbing
on
the
finish
does
wonders
for
the
drinkability
rich
and
semicomplex
it
really
offers
a
fun
ride
all
the
way
through
i
am
shocked
at
how
much
i
am
enjoying
this
bottle
and
will
have
to
pick
up
more
than
the
one
or
two
i
do
each
year
i
have
had
this
at
a
few
different
stages
including
a
6year
old
version
on
tap
i
think
this
might
be
the
best
bottle
i
have
had
maybe
2
and
a
half
years
is
right
in
the
wheelhouse
hmmmm
more
research
is
in
order
i
do
believe
the
flavor
mellowed
out
but
still
maintains
an
intensity
i
get
candied
orange
some
light
chocolate
dusting
a
present
bitterness
but
the
hops
have
faded
some
light
oxidation
and
a
long
long
finish
a
surprising
treat
incredibly
smooth
incredible
drinkable
given
the
abv
and
style
drinking
very
nice
right
now
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
below
average
overall
it
was
a
pretty
solid
beer
of
the
style
all
around
it
felt
pretty
balanced
for
the
style
as
well
both
the
malty
and
hoppy
qualities
shined
at
one
time
or
another
while
drinking
it
pretty
enjoyable
beer
to
sip
on
this
evening
2010
pours
orangish
amber
with
12
inch
white
head
dissipates
into
very
little
lace
aroma
of
toffee
taste
of
fruits
and
toffee
mouth
feel
is
at
a
medium
slightly
sticky
to
the
tongue
overall
a
great
barley
wine
another
year
might
make
an
improvement
o
overall
i
dig
it
it
is
easy
to
drink
the
abv
is
invisible
id
love
to
try
it
fresh
but
the
year
or
so
on
it
certainly
couldnt
have
hurt
it
since
it
is
so
tasty
and
smooth
o
a
little
to
phenolic
for
me
kind
of
sweet
and
sharp
made
it
a
bit
difficult
to
get
through
the
entire
12
oz
not
a
bad
beer
pours
a
murky
honey
brown
with
a
1
inch
fizzy
light
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
carameltoffee
alcohol
and
citrus
zest
taste
is
of
bready
malt
brown
sugar
carameltoffee
and
citrus
zest
hops
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
barleywine
with
a
nice
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
o
i
think
this
was
pretty
well
crafted
overall
but
it
is
still
no
match
for
its
rather
stiff
competition
in
the
bw
category
ill
have
this
one
again
but
definitely
wont
seek
it
out
an
average
barleywine
has
a
few
things
to
work
out
and
it
could
improve
overall
a
decent
american
barleywine
but
it
certianly
reminds
me
of
why
i
like
their
english
counterparts
so
much
more
o
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
o
a
great
offering
one
id
seek
out
again
only
wish
there
was
more
carbonation
id
like
to
try
a
fresh
one
to
see
the
true
hop
profile
overall
a
very
good
barley
wine
taste
as
if
it
had
a
year
or
two
on
it
smooth
with
the
taste
melding
together
well
better
than
most
not
as
good
as
some
worthy
o
highly
underrated
barleywine
i
think
that
real
ale
has
been
perfecting
their
recipe
over
the
years
and
now
it
is
among
the
best
of
the
variety
if
you
are
a
fan
of
barleywines
than
i
suggest
you
ask
for
one
or
five
during
your
next
trade
with
someone
from
texas
theyre
fairly
abundant
from
what
i
can
tell
just
fyi
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
its
the
first
2
year
old
barley
wine
ive
had
so
i
dont
have
a
ton
of
comparison
i
would
seek
this
out
again
o
a
diamond
in
the
rough
must
get
more
of
this
to
age
its
not
harsh
or
overly
hopped
like
some
barleywines
id
love
to
try
the
french
oak
aged
barleywine
kraken
thanks
again
jeff
overall
i
think
this
was
closer
to
an
english
barleywine
due
to
the
pronounced
sweetness
and
fruity
notes
but
even
so
it
wasnt
near
the
top
of
the
style
a
solid
beer
but
one
not
worth
seeking
i
actually
like
this
quite
a
bit
the
maltforward
profile
balance
and
booze
character
is
what
i
want
when
i
think
of
a
barleywine
this
years
was
better
than
previous
that
ive
had
recommended
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
but
think
it
could
use
a
couple
more
years
on
it
d
a
solid
barleywine
that
has
aged
well
maybe
a
year
past
its
prime
would
like
to
try
this
fresh
to
see
how
far
its
come
a
good
barleywine
but
not
the
best
ive
tried
this
was
a
decent
offering
of
the
style
its
good
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
always
grateful
to
try
beers
i
cant
get
here
though
so
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
hector
o
being
that
its
my
fault
not
giving
it
enough
time
i
cant
be
too
harsh
that
being
said
the
harshness
of
the
booze
is
a
bit
much
given
time
id
like
to
try
this
again
o
if
i
had
regular
access
to
this
beer
it
would
be
a
regular
purchase
worth
more
than
the
3
99
i
payed
for
the
bottle
excellent
beer
right
here
o
real
ale
has
a
solid
barleywine
here
interested
what
some
age
will
bring
only
a
couple
a
day
at
most
after
i
noticed
the
11
5
abv
jesus
christ
this
beer
could
put
you
in
danger
with
its
easy
drinkability
it
is
a
definite
american
style
barleywine
although
brewed
with
english
malts
o
decent
bw
could
use
a
little
higher
srm
to
add
to
some
of
the
malt
potential
on
this
beer
okay
not
the
best
overall
i
did
enjoy
this
but
would
like
to
try
it
with
some
age
to
lessen
the
alcohol
presence
overall
a
rather
malty
barleywine
not
bad
but
it
seems
like
it
needs
a
little
time
to
mellow
out
light
in
body
and
smooth
the
alcohol
inhibits
the
drinkability
and
knowing
what
it
could
be
hurts
it
as
well
with
1
2
of
age
it
starts
to
drink
fabulously
new
however
ill
pass
dhot
beer
would
not
be
able
to
drink
too
much
of
this
but
good
version
of
this
style
glad
to
have
tried
it
as
drinkable
and
approachable
an
american
barleywine
as
i
have
come
across
highly
recommended
aroma
of
sweet
malts
and
a
very
nice
fruity
undertone
including
hints
of
orange
apricot
and
pear
with
a
light
alcohol
on
the
nose
as
well
moderate
caramel
malts
lead
into
a
strong
fruit
presence
consisting
mostly
of
citrus
orange
and
apricot
giving
way
to
a
nice
bitter
hop
finish
smooth
on
the
palate
with
a
nice
drying
finish
pours
cloudy
orange
head
is
good
and
beige
smells
floral
fruity
melony
cucumber
sweet
goodness
taste
is
fruity
and
floral
slight
mango
hop
bittering
sweet
tangerine
some
dominating
flavors
combating
subtile
ones
here
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
carbonation
is
high
due
to
the
flavor
amplification
this
brew
suffers
on
the
drinkability
but
a
pretty
solid
brew
overall
as
far
as
barleywines
go
they
dont
get
much
more
drinkable
this
is
not
cloyingly
sweet
or
palate
shredding
bitter
balanced
flavors
and
subtle
concealed
alcohol
make
it
an
easy
sipper
this
beer
pours
a
copper
colour
with
a
nice
off
white
head
smells
of
caramel
toffee
and
some
dark
fruits
the
dark
fruits
come
through
strong
in
the
taste
mainly
raisins
and
plums
the
back
palate
hosts
toffee
caramel
and
butterscotch
it
is
like
a
dessert
mouthfeel
is
light
heavy
with
warming
alcohol
presence
perfect
for
a
cold
day
a
true
sipper
and
this
one
will
catch
up
to
you
fast
but
it
is
worth
it

with
the
flavor
profile
fairly
large
but
i
want
more
aggressive
malt
and
darker
fruits
here
its
nice
but
im
not
sure
this
particular
year
is
going
to
get
better
this
is
a
beast
of
a
beer
but
very
enjoyable
take
your
time
with
this
one
cheers
beertracker
d
the
new
year
is
still
young
but
this
has
to
be
the
frontrunner
for
the
surprise
of
the
year
so
far
an
incredible
beer
from
start
to
finish
and
it
achieves
near
perfection
in
every
aspect
ive
never
had
it
fresh
but
aged
this
one
is
a
masterpiece
through
and
through
amazing
will
compare
soon
to
the
09
vintage
and
revise
my
rating
if
necessary
this
is
a
good
beer
but
really
fades
into
the
background
compared
to
the
ever
increasing
amount
of
really
great
barleywines
out
there
also
tried
a
2009
recently
as
well
and
while
it
was
pretty
good
it
wasnt
nearly
on
the
same
level
as
the
2008
either
2008
was
an
especially
good
batch
or
this
ages
incredibly
after
2
years
goes
by
definitely
recommend
buying
some
of
this
up
and
drinking
it
after
its
2
or
more
years
old
d
tasty
brew
and
a
solid
barleywine
a
nice
sipper
d
amazingly
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
not
overwhelming
at
all
and
although
you
cant
really
taste
the
alcohol
it
still
is
a
slow
burn
to
it
d
not
too
bad
but
hard
for
me
to
get
through
since
it
isnt
the
tastiest
barleywine
out
there
md
pretty
thick
mouthfeel
very
flavorful
and
tasty
although
the
drinkability
isnt
great
a
good
beer
id
recommend
though
surprisingly
really
good
get
it
and
drink
it
thanks
again
for
this
one
jeff
somewhat
dusty
looking
orangeamber
color
not
much
carbonation
though
seems
somewhat
lively
in
the
glass
poured
like
a
sticky
syrup
heavy
malt
trace
of
alcohol
and
a
kiss
of
hops
aroma
wise
big
big
malty
flavor
dried
fruit
and
a
heavy
caramel
sweetness
enough
of
an
alcohol
burn
to
be
noticeable
but
in
a
good
way
sticky
resiny
and
gummy
flavors
same
in
the
bodya
sticky
smooth
creamy
quality
to
it
that
i
love
really
stands
up
in
the
glass
really
quite
the
us
barleywine
not
the
huge
hopbomb
like
bigfoot
or
old
ruffian
but
damn
fine
yummo
while
this
smells
and
feels
like
a
high
alcohol
beer
i
would
never
have
guessed
just
how
high
excellent
drinkability
for
the
style
and
for
the
abv
in
all
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
i
might
have
to
pick
up
another
bottle
when
i
head
back
for
groceries
tomorrow
night
d
considering
this
is
11
5
abv
it
is
insanely
drinkable
not
sure
what
happened
to
this
one
over
the
past
3
years
but
it
was
somewhat
flat
and
something
seemed
off
in
the
taste
as
i
noted
before
it
seemed
watered
down
would
like
to
try
a
more
recent
vintage
to
compare
it
to
but
probably
wouldnt
want
to
try
a
2007
again
3

d
overall
this
is
fairly
boring
its
not
bad
but
could
use
an
infusion
of
flavor
the
body
had
a
real
good
heft
to
it
carbonation
very
mild
but
it
doesnt
need
anymore
the
feel
was
real
thick
and
creamy
almost
to
the
point
where
it
was
doughy
despite
being
as
viscous
as
10000
miles
worth
of
pennzoil
its
brutally
easy
to
drink
one
must
watch
out
because
real
brewing
does
a
noble
job
of
sneaking
quite
a
bit
of
booze
in
this
bad
boy
beer
is
thick
and
surprisingly
not
very
sweet
up
front
there
is
some
heat
at
the
back
and
it
finishes
mildly
dry
but
doesnt
dry
me
out
there
is
some
mild
sweetness
in
the
mid
to
late
palate
minimal
hop
presence
throughout
the
more
i
drink
the
more
the
taste
creeps
forward
its
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
for
its
size
id
say
its
well
above
average
id
have
it
again
overall
a
decent
bwine
but
not
too
hoppy
all
sweetness
and
malty
fairly
drinkable
d
not
overly
sweet
though
leaning
that
way
still
a
good
bitterness
and
balance
this
could
be
good
fresh
or
with
age
d
this
was
a
alright
barleywine
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
it
but
it
was
not
a
drain
pour
in
the
slightest
maybe
an
infected
bottle
or
maybe
a
overcarbonated
bottle
i
have
a
couple
more
bottles
of
this
so
im
actually
looking
forward
to
them
bottle
of
the
2008
batch
pours
a
slightly
opaque
burnt
orange
color
with
a
coastered
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
super
matly
with
notes
of
dark
fruit
like
raisins
and
plum
some
spice
notes
as
well
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
mediumheavy
mouthfeel
malty
upfront
with
a
transition
to
some
bitterness
and
alcohol
not
a
whoe
lot
going
on
in
this
one
pretty
run
of
the
mill
conclusion
very
pleased
with
this
beer
and
i
would
have
it
again
a
good
beer
from
the
little
town
of
blanco
sisyphus
poured
into
my
snifter
as
a
warm
red
amber
topped
with
a
large
pillowy
head
of
foam
and
a
small
amount
of
lacing
to
the
nose
it
was
quite
candylike
sweet
honey
candied
citrus
fruit
and
the
barest
trace
of
a
hop
tang
in
the
background
on
the
tongue
the
effervescence
yields
to
a
strong
brown
sugar
note
and
syrup
which
is
kept
interesting
by
the
addition
of
a
bright
zesty
flare
of
hops
as
others
have
said
this
brew
is
quite
skilled
at
concealing
its
gravity
and
is
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
for
easy
consumption
but
if
youre
looking
to
savor
something
slowly
on
a
night
meant
for
relaxing
its
quite
fitting
my
first
offering
from
real
ale
sisyphus
isnt
bad
but
there
are
so
many
better
options
in
this
segment
d
great
beer
this
could
probably
age
for
a
several
more
years
and
more
malt
flavors
would
emerge
it
would
even
benefit
from
a
little
oxidation
overall
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
d
this
is
the
best
example
of
a
barelywine
that
i
have
found
really
reallyl
great
but
i
cant
honestly
give
it
hi
marks
for
drinkablility
what
with
the
hi
abv
and
huge
body
this
is
just
too
rich
for
sessioning
2009
vintage
reviewed
blind
as
part
of
the
blind
beers
bif
here
we
go
it
pours
a
cloudy
amber
closer
to
the
browner
side
of
the
spectrum
topped
by
a
nice
finger
of
creamy
foam
the
nose
comprises
mandarin
oranges
caramel
honey
orange
peel
biscuits
and
a
touch
of
rye
bread
the
taste
starts
with
a
nice
bite
of
citrus
and
pine
followed
quickly
by
rush
of
heavy
caramel
and
toasted
biscuits
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
a
lightish
carbonation
and
a
feel
that
borders
on
the
chewy
a
very
tasty
abw
one
i
wish
i
had
access
to
on
a
regular
basis
sisyphus
is
a
heck
of
a
barleywine
especially
as
far
as
drinkability
is
concerned
its
engaging
enough
to
be
a
fully
enjoyable
drinking
experience
a
quick
one
at
that
since
it
isnt
particularly
intense
good
stuff
d
one
of
the
more
drinkable
barleywines
ive
tasted
which
is
a
bit
tricky
considering
the
skyhigh
alcohol
and
caloric
counts
enjoy
in
moderation
as
far
as
the
style
goes
its
pretty
good
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
yet
its
not
bad
by
a
long
shot
barleywines
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
so
in
my
opinion
there
has
to
be
a
lot
going
on
for
me
to
rate
it
world
class
with
that
being
said
its
a
solid
well
made
american
model
and
if
you
are
ever
down
in
texas
and
come
across
this
id
recommend
you
grab
one
because
who
knows
when
you
might
see
it
again
and
also
it
might
be
worth
wile
to
lay
down
in
your
cellar
for
a
few
years
to
see
how
it
develops
of
course
you
might
disagree
with
me
completely
and
thats
why
its
called
taste
and
opinion
this
was
listed
at
480
calories
for
the
bottle
which
is
insane
you
can
feel
every
last
calorie
too
in
sugar
and
in
alcohol
packing
pounds
on
you
as
you
down
each
drop
decent
but
not
worth
it
if
youre
on
a
diet
or
if
youre
not
just
drink
an
aged
bigfoot
like
i
did
right
afterwards
which
was
way
better
d
too
high
abv
to
be
sessionable
interesting
enough
to
come
back
for
a
second
i
wish
this
one
was
available
here
overall
i
didnt
think
this
one
was
sour
or
infected
as
others
noted
with
this
vintage
much
props
to
jjfoodie
for
this
wonderful
brew
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
snifter
amber
in
color
with
1
finger
white
head
smells
of
earthy
hops
dark
fruit
slight
malt
and
slight
alcohol
taste
follows
through
adding
slight
hop
bitterness
and
less
malty
than
expected
full
body
and
light
carbonation
good
drinkability
for
a
barley
wine
i
wish
i
had
more
to
age
its
funny
how
these
things
work
last
time
i
had
a
huge
move
one
of
the
last
beers
i
drank
at
my
apartment
was
the
07
vintage
of
sisyphus
two
years
later
its
still
the
same
beer
and
same
vintage
this
one
however
isnt
infected
it
is
sadly
rather
mediocre
utterly
lacking
in
definition
and
identity
this
beer
is
a
blend
of
nondescript
aromas
and
flavors
brown
sugar
a
little
honey
some
caramel
on
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
modestly
sweet
this
beer
is
mediumfull
on
the
palate
and
an
utter
disappointment
stm
223
5
flavor
is
semicomplex
with
dark
fruits
booze
molasses
mild
hop
bite
and
burnt
tobacco
overall
its
a
mellowsweet
flavor
medium
to
full
body
semihigh
carbonation
but
not
overkill
at
all
very
tasty
beer
glad
i
got
this
in
as
an
extra
overall
this
wasnt
that
bad
at
first
and
then
it
started
getting
cloying
dont
think
ill
be
having
this
one
again
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
i
thought
it
was
wellbalanced
and
enjoyed
it
as
a
malt
maven
i
imagine
i
will
find
it
even
more
tasty
with
a
few
years
of
aging
on
it
verdict
bursting
with
great
flavors
balanced
brilliantly
and
surprising
quffable
sisyphus
is
a
real
delight
i
cant
wait
to
sit
down
and
try
a
vertical
of
the
vintages
i
have
on
hand
to
see
how
this
evolves
for
an
11
50er
this
one
is
smooth
and
drinks
perfectly
this
one
drinks
flawlessly
recommended
i
dont
think
ive
encountered
real
ale
brewing
company
beer
before
sisyphus
is
pretty
damn
good
its
an
interesting
barleywine
im
not
accustomed
to
such
a
fruity
flavor
but
it
works
well
i
think
id
like
a
little
more
dark
fruit
but
the
lack
of
it
doesnt
hurt
things
much
more
bubbles
would
be
good
as
well
hats
off
to
whoever
figured
out
how
to
make
beer
this
big
seem
so
small
wow
good
stuff
recommended
thanks
chris
edit
i
see
now
that
a
couple
of
others
have
picked
up
a
wild
brett
influence
if
you
have
2007s
of
this
drink
em
or
send
them
my
way
im
glad
i
hung
onto
these
bottles
for
this
minivertical
and
if
i
see
any
more
07s
08s
and
this
years
09s
on
the
shelf
i
think
ill
pick
up
another
round
to
try
in
another
year
pours
reddish
orange
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
beer
is
somewhat
murky
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
alcohol
and
some
fruit
possibly
grapes
and
apples
the
flavor
is
caramel
toffee
assorted
fruit
and
alcohol
the
beer
is
slightly
boozy
and
the
alcohol
is
warming
the
finish
is
some
slightly
bitter
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
lowmedium
carbonation
d
a
solid
barleywine
nothing
fantastic
also
have
a
2008
bottle
to
open
soon
and
compare
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
maybe
a
little
thinner
than
i
was
expecting
with
a
fairly
light
carbonation
with
the
rather
low
carbonationsmooth
feel
and
the
well
hidden
alcohol
this
is
a
dangerously
easy
beer
to
drink
drinkability
easy
to
drink
in
a
12
oz
bottle
but
more
than
one
and
i
would
need
a
driver
drinkability
is
high
because
i
love
bws
and
this
was
damn
good
bw
proud
to
have
a
good
beer
from
texas
i
think
they
are
pretty
scarce
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
barleywines
yet
but
this
one
has
convinced
me
i
need
to
try
more
of
them
first
time
i
have
had
this
beer
it
was
quite
amazing
beautiful
color
feel
taste
smell
everything
about
it
was
gooood
im
very
happy
that
real
ale
is
finally
bottling
up
more
of
their
beers
i
have
a
lot
of
people
that
love
the
real
ale
company
and
i
think
its
about
time
that
they
all
get
to
taste
them
on
the
go
2008
was
the
year
of
sisyphus
that
i
had
gold
label
a
big
abv
limits
drinkabilty
but
it
doesnt
kick
the
same
way
some
others
do
surprisingly
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
this
is
the
first
aged
barleywine
i
have
tried
and
it
makes
me
wonder
how
much
better
the
fresh
ones
ive
had
would
be
had
i
been
patient
with
them
i
have
to
deduct
points
off
the
drinkability
scale
because
the
beer
is
all
around
weak
for
what
i
expected
not
only
that
but
the
flavors
get
old
fast
pair
that
with
a
heavy
abv
and
it
kind
of
gets
to
be
a
chore
to
drink
definitely
worth
checking
out
but
i
would
only
enjoy
one
every
once
in
a
while
not
a
bad
thing
for
a
good
beer
that
will
age
very
well
overall
a
nice
barleywine
and
one
i
would
like
to
try
fresh
that
being
said
i
do
see
some
significant
aging
potential
for
this
one
and
i
am
glad
i
have
an
07
bottle
as
well
to
put
some
more
age
on
a
nice
barleywine
thanks
barks
d
pretty
good
barleywine
overall
with
a
decent
hop
bite
although
this
wasnt
overly
malty
this
struck
me
as
more
of
an
english
style

than
an
american
style

tart
fruitiness
mild

over
attenuated

the
odd
tartness
and
urine
notes
seems
out
of
place
maybe
i
didnt
need
to
include
out
of
place
here
and
creates
a
very
different
aroma
compared
to
most
barleywines
ive
had
the
taste
isnt
nearly
as
tart
and
has
sweet
malts
to
start
followed
by
fruity
tartness
that
enters
early
and
only
becomes
more
tart
as
the
experience
progresses
i
get
a
hint
of
caramel
too
but
it
is
far
too
meek
a
note
this
is
a
must
try
overall
a
good
tasting
brew
that
i
could
pick
up
and
enjoy
anytime

said
this
one
was
on
tap
because
it
was
a
2007
vintage
it
was
in
a
bottle
very
good
get
some
if
you
can
find
it
i
never
tried
this
fresh
but
all
thats
left
for
hops
is
bitterness
but
it
doesnt
matter
because
the
malt
is
so
good
really
good
not
sure
why
the
rating
is
relatively
low
this
pretty
much
destroys
every
canadian
barleywine
ive
tasted
except
for
rudges
creations
thanks
grant
d
big
beer
not
a
session
by
any
stretch
nice
though
d
for
a
barleywine
quite
drinkable
im
curious
what
the
2007
that
i
have
will
taste
like
since
this
was
already
pretty
mellow
drinkability
is
great
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
tropical
fruit
aspect
gives
it
a
nice
depth
and
new
dimension
not
typically
seen
in
american
barleywines
good
stuff
pours
a
mostly
clear
orange
very
vibrant
colour
thick
white
head
forms
quickly
settles
down
to
a
medium
ring
around
the
glass
tons
of
lace
spots
stick
to
the
glass
real
nice
pattern
looks
pretty
damn
good
smell
is
nice
lots
of
caramel
very
fruity
lots
of
sweetness
brown
sugar
peaches
and
apricot
alcohol
oranges
and
grapefruit
maple
syrup
mangoes
pretty
nice
taste
is
neat
caramel
and
brown
sugar
sweetness
grapefruits
and
orange
peel
some
spiciness
very
malty
biscuity
mango
very
tropical
touch
of
raisin
and
alcohol
very
fruity
in
the
finish
solid
balance
pretty
nice
barleywine
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
pretty
smooth
for
the
abv
not
spectacular
but
definitely
enjoyable
last
07
bottle
i
had
was
somewhat
infected
so
its
good
to
see
that
isnt
a
lasting
problem
thanks
greg
fruits
on
the
palate
and
not
enough
malt
maybe
some
coconut
i
was
immediately
turned
off
of
this
one
and
didnt
spend
the
time
to
investigate
something
a
bit
off
about
this
one
possibly
because
it
needs
more
of
everything
but
fruit
and
alcohol
it
does
have
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
but
a
bit
too
much
syrup
everything
else
needs
a
good
bit
of
work
certainly
doesnt
stick
to
the
style
sisyphus
2007
poured
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
thick
tannish
head
great
lacing
down
the
glass
i
noticed
some
white
chunks
floating
around
in
the
beer
even
though
i
stopped
short
on
the
pour
and
it
had
been
sitting
upright
for
a
while
lots
of
woody
sour
beer
horse
blanket
notes
in
the
aroma
some
malt
and
hop
but
overpowered
by
brett
this
is
when
i
looked
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
notiched
the
little
round
blackish
brown
and
white
chunks
sitting
there
this
bottle
is
definitely
infected
with
brett
its
a
good
thing
i
happened
to
like
the
brett
flavor
i
risked
it
and
drank
it
and
it
was
pretty
tasty
a
slight
caramel
flavor
that
is
quickly
overcome
by
the
combination
of
alcohol
woody
pine
hop
and
a
heavy
wild
brett
flavor
nice
and
oaky
and
barnyard
sour
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thick
but
i
couldnt
imagine
it
any
thinner
for
this
style
drinkability
is
alright
however
since
this
seems
like
it
is
an
infected
batch
so
im
a
little
wary
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
i
would
like
i
think
this
should
have
just
a
little
more
viscousness
the
carbonation
is
on
the
lower
side
and
isnt
a
problem
the
alcohol
is
invisible
the
drinkability
is
really
just
short
of
fantastic
the
beer
disappeared
at
an
alarming
rate
i
would
have
never
pegged
texas
as
the
location
for
the
brewer
of
a
big
bold
barleywine
i
poured
this
fairly
hard
because
i
wanted
to
get
a
nice
aroma
release
the
head
formed
slow
late
and
very
little
appeared
it
did
have
the
typical
barleywine
color
a
cloudy
dark
amber
the
first
smell
to
arrive
was
honey
and
lots
of
it
with
raisins
and
figs
to
back
it
up
note
to
self
do
a
blind
tasting
with
aged
barleywines
and
old
ales
more
raisins
in
the
taste
hid
the
alcohol
well
and
had
a
delicious
caramel
malt
presence
it
had
a
sweetness
to
it
but
it
wasnt
overboard
and
not
too
syrupy
there
wasnt
much
carbonation
left
but
was
velvetey
smooth
and
had
some
viscosity
every
sip
was
very
enjoyable
and
didnt
want
to
reach
the
bottom
in
fact
i
think
i
will
a
solid
representation
of
the
american
barleywine
style
very
impressive
display
of
malts
all
while
a
sickly
easy
to
drink
drinkability
good
stuff
here
real
ale
im
gonna
go
out
on
a
limb
and
say
the
2007
is
one
of
the
tastiest
barleywines
ive
ever
had
age
has
done
wonders
to
this
beer
imo
but
then
again
i
havent
had
it
fresh
kudos
to
real
ale
on
both
of
these
this
was
my
first
time
trying
this
beer
and
thought
it
worked
well
on
cask
as
previously
mentioned
the
high
abv
was
well
hidden
and
the
citrus
kick
helped
make
this
a
great
beer
will
have
to
search
out
the
bottled
version
the
next
time
i
am
in
tx
a
solid
barleywine
and
a
sweet
offering
i
would
age
it
some
more
and
see
if
the
bite
relaxes
and
the
sweet
mellows
out
thanks
to
wagenvolks
for
the
trade
of
both
2007
and
2008
bottles
each
one
is
poured
into
a
brooklyn
tulip
07
pours
a
quite
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
razor
thin
offwhite
head
08
pours
a
tad
less
hazy
with
a
slightly
more
welldefined
head
aroma
is
burnt
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
07
much
more
abundant
than
08
the
taste
is
loads
of
brown
sugar
with
sweet
fruits
and
as
expected
the
08
possesses
a
more
defined
almost
cloying
sweetness
that
has
greatly
subdued
in
the
07
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
08
being
a
bit
heavier
this
one
is
a
decent
barley
wine
but
i
have
had
better
maybe
i
was
spoiled
by
having
the
incredible
lagunitas
olde
gnarlywine
a
few
weeks
ago
but
this
one
just
fell
short
of
the
mark
i
had
high
hopes
being
a
real
ale
fan
for
years
but
this
just
did
not
have
the
depth
i
was
anticipating
where
is
the
character
drinkability
is
limited
somewhat
by
all
that
sweetness
but
still
a
pretty
nice
barleywine
i
love
the
fact
this
one
is
made
in
texas
and
sporatically
available
i
will
drink
it
again
and
the
2008
is
just
now
coming
out
and
has
a
gold
label
d
i
would
prefer
a
few
more
hops
to
cut
the
toffee
flavor
it
gets
cloying
as
you
drink
it
not
my
favorite
barleywine
but
quite
nice
and
i
truly
dig
the
feel
lots
of
lip
smacking
ive
liked
more
than
the
ba
average
many
real
ale
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
drinkability
good
just
not
memorable
d
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
but
one
to
which
i
will
happily
return
pours
a
light
brown
colored
body
had
to
work
to
get
the
head
offwhite
color
good
lacing
not
very
lasting
somewhat
lacing
strong
hoppy
aroma
sweetness
some
dustiness
some
syrupyness
some
malts
dusty
sweet
taste
not
as
strong
as
a
typical
barley
wine
the
body
is
big
with
a
good
warming
effect
carbonation
is
very
light
would
like
a
bit
more
balance
here
some
sweetness
in
the
finish
but
ok
versus
the
alcohol
notes
overall
reading
other
reviews
this
beer
seems
to
age
well
over
time
would
suggest
to
age
a
bit
longer
than
i
did
2010
edition
shipped
from
augustgarage
was
much
much
better
smooth
mouthfeel
better
drinkability
though
smell
just
ok
d
very
drinkable
for
a
10
barleywine
a
sipper
herbal
bitterness
mixes
in
as
it
goes
despite
the
aging
alcohol
shows
but
doesnt
dominate
not
my
favorite
barleywine
but
a
fine
example
of
the
style
the
flavor
doesnt
exactly
make
sisyphus
stand
out
as
a
top
10
barleywine
but
it
drinks
nicely
and
masks
the
11
5
extremely
well
starts
out
with
a
blast
of
grassy
citric
hops
and
quickly
succumbs
to
sweet
boozy
sugars
toasted
caramel
malt
and
a
nutty
graininess
not
a
hint
of
hotness
to
be
found
hops
linger
throughout
the
finish
adding
a
nice
bitterness
to
complement
the
syrupy
mediumthick
body
all
in
all
a
tasty
barleywine
that
id
gladly
purchase
again
in
many
ways
sisyphus
reminds
me
of
elysian
brewings
cyclops
barleywine
but
with
a
bit
more
malty
depth
i
think
the
2year
mark
is
about
perfect
for
this
brew
not
too
hot
and
the
hops
are
still
in
effect
sorry
to
say
this
one
wasnt
much
more
than
mediocre
for
me
this
is
the
second
real
ale
ive
tried
neither
was
notable
at
all
lots
of
far
superior
barleywines
out
there
i
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
all
the
previous
real
ale
brews
ive
tried
and
i
approach
this
one
with
much
anticipation
this
2007
vintage
pours
cherry
red
with
some
orange
hues
the
head
grows
to
almost
one
finger
in
heighth
but
not
until
the
very
end
of
the
pour
and
it
recedes
quickly
with
some
disorganized
spots
of
lacing
left
behind
the
smell
of
very
sweet
caramel
and
resiny
hops
mix
as
some
dark
fruits
yeast
and
grain
move
around
underneath
a
faint
musty
earthiness
is
detected
the
hops
dont
hit
upon
the
first
sip
as
much
as
they
linger
throughout
the
palate
theres
a
good
amount
of
fruity
tanginess
and
bready
sweetness
which
balances
things
perfectly
and
doesnt
keep
the
barley
and
pine
resin
from
surfacing
toward
the
end
the
body
lies
toward
the
medium
to
heavy
end
but
its
goes
down
smooth
without
much
alcohol
11
5
being
noticed
and
without
weighing
too
much
on
the
stomach
this
is
an
exceptional
barleywine
that
doesnt
seem
as
extreme
tasting
as
its
alcohol
content
would
suggest
and
whose
components
work
in
concert
without
individual
extravagances
a
smokey
boozey
hoppy
barleywine
a
bit
of
initial
sweetness
but
not
much
of
it
makes
it
to
the
residual
stages
slick
and
buttery
some
toffee
has
a
deep
smokey
booziness
like
a
scotch
almost
reminds
me
of
a
harsh
old
ale
in
that
respect
these
factors
are
the
big
detractors
for
me
i
didnt
like
that
taste
in
founders
curmudgeon
and
though
a
different
style
i
really
dont
care
for
it
here
either
mellows
out
a
bit
as
the
beer
approaches
peak
temperature
but
definitely
not
the
easiest
drink
in
the
world
finishes
with
a
bitter
hop
flourish
a
very
hoppy
barleywine
whereas
i
prefer
them
on
the
sweet
side
seems
pretty
well
made
but
has
a
few
different
aspects
that
dont
seem
to
agree
with
me
the
mouth
feel
is
fine
its
perfectly
carbonated
for
what
it
is
it
goes
down
very
well
and
very
fine
and
tastes
like
a
mix
of
carmel
and
sweet
fruit
doesnt
go
down
much
better
than
your
average
craft
brew
but
the
best
thing
ive
had
from
real
ale
wo
a
doubt
one
of
the
more
drinkable
barleywines
ive
come
across
light
and
easy
drinking
not
overpowering
d
obviously
not
a
session
beer
at
11
5
abv
but
very
nice
for
what
it
is
which
for
me
is
an
inauguration
celebration
congrats
america
overall
a
very
good
beer
this
is
the
first
barleywine
i
have
ever
had
and
if
others
are
this
good
then
this
style
is
going
to
quickly
move
up
the
list
of
my
favorite
styles
pours
a
nice
golden
orangered
color
some
carbonation
not
much
of
a
head
but
some
fizzyness
which
does
leave
some
oil
slicks
and
small
islands
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
hops
nice
touch
of
spices
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
nice
hop
punch
and
spicy
medium
body
the
alcohol
is
hidden
pretty
well
leaves
the
body
warm
very
drinkable
this
is
a
tasty
bwsa
this
was
an
alright
barleywine
but
there
are
certainly
better
ones
it
seems
pretty
generic
and
lacks
complexity
drinkability
not
a
terribly
good
barleywine
in
my
opinion
though
perhaps
this
one
just
didnt
age
well
it
was
interesting
enough
intensely
fruity
and
malty
but
just
a
little
too
light
over
all
a
little
too
alcoholic
and
a
little
too
salty
drinkability
is
insane
ive
had
different
vintages
of
this
beer
aged
between
1
and
1
and
a
half
years
but
never
one
over
2
years
aged
and
it
definitely
smoothed
this
beer
out
alot
this
is
almost
like
liquid
candy
so
smooth
and
flavorful
sad
that
this
was
my
last
one
must
trade
to
get
more
of
this
beer
and
looking
forward
to
aging
it
longer
to
see
how
it
changes
overall
a
very
nice
brew
the
guys
at
real
ale
have
impressed
me
with
their
session
beers
and
now
this
heavier
one
d
for
this
beer
being
a
barleywine
and
so
high
in
abv
it
goes
down
incredibly
easy
this
beer
is
tasty
and
just
complex
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
so
damned
drinkable
i
am
a
bit
taken
aback
by
this
just
great
highly
recommended
dfor
the
chilly
late
fall
and
winter
months
here
in
texas
its
a
perfect
evening
sipper
or
would
go
great
with
a
hearty
dessert
sopapilla
cheesecake
anyone
overall
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
specialty
beer
from
the
little
real
ale
brewery
theyve
definatly
got
a
good
one
here
d
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
not
harsh
at
all
like
some
barley
wines
are
i
was
very
impressed
and
would
have
this
one
again
in
a
hearbeat
d
wow
nice
sipper
and
okay
for
the
season
but
too
thick
any
other
time
of
the
year
in
my
opinion
same
stone
fruits
in
the
mouth
with
a
lot
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
slightly
sour
and
not
sure
if
it
should
be
however
it
is
still
very
tasty
and
full
of
flavor
mouth
is
very
tight
and
full
of
hop
bitterness
too
much
so
for
my
barley
wine
style
preference
overall
a
delicious
beer
id
place
it
closer
to
english
style
barleywine
with
a
solid
bitterness
reminds
me
of
the
solid
inbetween
barleywines
like
rogue
old
crustacean
i
think
this
is
still
probably
a
bit
fresh
which
would
explain
the
harshness
lay
it
down
for
a
year
or
two
and
i
bet
it
will
mellow
out
and
the
clever
mix
of
flavors
will
emerge
and
blossom
thanks
to
ballewblake
for
this
one
it
pours
out
an
opaque
burnt
orange
like
a
roasted
pumpkin
with
no
head
and
leaves
little
lacing
the
smell
is
of
aged
hops
burnt
sugar
a
little
orange
peel
and
just
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
like
syrup
with
just
a
little
carbonation
tingling
on
the
tongue
the
hops
come
through
in
the
taste
but
they
are
sweet
and
mellow
there
is
some
vanilla
and
a
hint
of
figs
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
and
there
is
a
bit
of
complexity
to
the
taste
a
great
beer
dnotes
this
one
deceptively
strong
beer
by
far
the
most
balanced
barleywine
i
have
ever
had
as
the
huge
malt
body
is
perfectly
balanced
by
a
good
dose
of
hops
but
yet
even
with
77ibus
as
claimed
by
real
ale
brewings
website
the
hops
are
not
overdone
at
all
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
a
2008
vintage
bottle
to
compare
it
to
this
2007
reminds
me
of
charlie
papazians
saying
regarding
that
a
barleywine
not
aged
enough
is
like
a
mountain
without
its
peak

given
what
else
ive
had
from
rabc
my
hopes
for
sisyphus
were
less
than
high
having
said
that
im
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
a
good
little
sipper
that
should
warm
the
bones
of
craft
beer
lovin
texans
during
those
frigid
35
degree

nights
only
about
an

and
toasty

tones
the
flavors
swirl
around
the
tongue
with
a
mixture
of
yeasty
spice
and
slightly
soured
dark
fruit
and
long
carmalized
richness
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
very
nice
alchol
is
well
hidden
in
the
flavor
porfile
enjoyably
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
bitter
heavy
hot
sweet
after
half
a
bottle
the
alcohol
became
apparent
a
very
nice
barleywine
from
real
ale
id
love
to
get
my
hands
on
more
bottles
pours
out
a
rich
tawny
color
with
almost
no
head
whatsoever
because
there
is
now
head
there
is
no
lacing
or
retention
obviously
the
smell
is
heavily
of
malted
barley
with
alcohol
also
the
taste
follows
the
smell
identically
it
is
an
incredibly
rich
taste
nothing
over
the
top
but
very
well
done
im
really
happy
i
was
able
to
try
this
great
beer
pretty
spot
on
in
the
mouthfeel
and
not
bad
to
drink
but
yah
hey
if
they
made
it
with
some
more
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweetness
and
to
give
it
a
little
tang
well
this
would
be
great
nice
sour
malt
on
the
2007
vintage
this
one
isent
as
ruff
as
most
barlywines
are
usaly
and
at
11
5
abv
ther
is
no
noticable
aolhocal
burn
in
the
after
taste
but
for
me
this
one
needs
more
hops
dont
get
me
wrong
i
enjoyed
every
last
sip
but
i
like
a
hoppy
barleywine
better
md
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
lingering
aftertaste
that
coats
the
mouth
very
drinkable
barleywine
but
the
alcohol
is
rather
steep
ill
admit
to
being
forewarned
about
possible
contamination
as
i
was
staring
into
the
beer
fridge
after
have
a
disappointingly
unfunky
uncomplex
weyerbacher
riserva
i
figured
what
the
heck
might
as
well
have
a
beer
were
the
funkiness
plays
a
distinctive
role
even
it
was
unintentional
judged
purely
to
style
this
is
a
monumental
failure
funk
has
no
place
in
a
modern
barleywine
but
taken
as
a
hedonistic
experience
it
is
not
half
bad
this
will
get
substantially
more
funky
with
time
as
it
seems
to
be
at
the
beginning
of
its
funk
journey
proceed
with
caution
but
with
an
open
mind
this
can
be
at
least
somewhat
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
quite
thick
and
viscous
with
a
slight
syrupy
quality
to
it
as
well
this
one
really
takes
hold
coats
the
palate
and
doesnt
hold
back
mellow
carbonation
works
in
well
overall
a
tasty
barleywine
from
texas
albeit
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
thanks
to
dmeadows
for
sending
this
my
way
i
wish
i
had
another
one
to
hang
onto
for
a
bit
in
reading
the
reviews
of
barleywinefiend
alexgash
and
johngalt1
it
seems
im
not
the
only
one
detecting
a
lot
of
uncharacteristic
funk
in
reading
a
lot
of
other
reviews
theres
no
mention
of
sournessfunk
so
perhaps
this
is
an
infected
batch
or
the
guys
from
jolly
pumpkin
sneaked
into
the
brewery
late
one
night
poured
an
orangishcopper
color
with
a
tan
white
head
carbonation
was
good
upfront
and
even
as
i
sip
the
head
stays
with
it
nose
was
hops
bitterness
and
a
funky
sournessnot
sure
if
this
was
intended
or
what
taste
was
a
little
sweet
hoppy
up
front
and
then
midway
through
as
i
swish
it
around
the
sourness
i
smelled
came
through
in
the
taste
it
was
almost
like
a
tart
bitterness
fruit
orange
peels
unripened
fruit
even
it
went
down
smoother
than
the
taste
interesting
bwine
indeed
another
bwine
down
thanks
mhewes
thanks
again
zack
pours
a
deep
hazy
amber
with
a
thin
dense
head
that
dissipated
to
a
ring
quickly
leaving
a
fair
bit
of
delicate
lacing
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
a
massive
candied
sugar
scent
that
had
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
background
but
not
much
the
flavor
is
also
dominated
by
the
candy
sugar
with
hints
of
caramel
malts
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
though
a
medicinal
taste
lingers
in
there
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
for
the
style
but
still
nice
and
creamy
this
is
a
decent
example
of
a
barleywine
though
the
sweetness
is
certainly
higher
than
most
into
an
imperial
pint
pours
a
lovely
dark
peach
orange
a
nice
offwhite
half
inch
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
lots
of
lacing
down
the
glass
and
sticks
in
arches
and
blots
the
aroma
is
a
nice
boquet
of
floras
and
leafy
hops
sweet
with
caramel
and
bready
malt
and
some
nice
fruits
the
taste
similarly
satisfies
but
the
mouth
is
extraordinary
velvety
smooth
the
effervescent
carbonation
the
light
warmth
supple
body
all
support
richly
malty
sweet
and
fruity
flavors
with
floral
spicy
hops
to
follow
everything
solid
but
far
from
overbearing
if
it
is
possible
to
make
a
high
alcohol
sessionable
barley
wine
this
is
it
much
thanks
and
praise

i
would
buy
it

kind
of
ruined
it
for

blechh
sorry
but
this
is
a
drainpour
a
really
complex
beer
that
i
love
a
seasonal
release
that
i
garb
a
bunch
of
every
year
to
enjoy
fresh
and
age
for
later
one
of
the
best
beers
made
in
texas
highly
recommended
pretty
good
little
brew
here
a
good
solid
little
barleywine
d
hmm
i
am
not
sure
about
this
one
i
think
most
of
the
group
at
the
tasting
hated
it
but
i
liked
it
i
have
to
admit
the
cat
piss
aroma
is
hard
to
get
by
but
its
a
rather
unique
tasting
barleywine
the
only
defect
i
see
in
this
beer
is
the
strange
sweetness
in
the
aroma
pretty
solid
beer
pours
a
heavy
orange
color
with
small
to
no
head
love
the
smell
full
of
hops
i
would
almost
call
this
a
double
ipa
but
whatever
very
solid
tasting
brew
lots
of
hops
followed
by
some
very
very
nice
understated
citrus
tones
really
a
good
beer
in
almost
all
aspects
the
abv
is
too
high
but
oh
well
what
the
hell
im
going
to
bed
now
anyway
best
thing
made
by
this
brewery
by
far
drinkability
while
not
a
bad
barleywine
it
doesnt
quite
display
the
grace
or
complexity
i
look
for
in
the
swanky
barleywine
style
strange
brew
and
from
the
reviews
i
must
have
got
a
weird
bottle
2007
version
pours
a
deep
a
redorange
color
with
an
average
head
and
below
average
lacing
and
slighty
under
carbonated
smells
of
citrus
and
bitter
hops
tastes
of
rich
malts
complemented
nicely
with
a
lot
of
hops
the
11
5
abv
is
very
well
hidden
a
great
beer
might
fine
barleywine
d
this
is
only
the
second
barley
wine
that
ive
tried
and
i
must
say
that
its
pretty
damn
good
ive
had
it
a
few
other
times
since
i
first
took
notes
and
ill
be
getting
more
of
it
again
very
nice
barleywine
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
review
number
900
american
bw
aspects
showed
up
subtly
versus
in
your
face
i
let
this
one
warm
up
quite
a
bit
too
prior
to
consumption
so
this
late
game
hop
surge
took
me
by
suprise
a
great
beer
masks
the
high
alcohol
fantastically
you
can
tell
that
aging
this
beer
for
a
really
long
time
will
be
in
order
snatch
the
07
while
you
still
can
thanks
to
turbine2475
for
the
bottle
pours
thick
and
viscous
and
a
beautiful
dark
orange
color
very
little
head
but
excellent
lacing
i
wonder
if
the
brewery
has
some
quality
issues
with
this
brew
some
of
the
reviews
seem
to
be
reviewing
a
different
beer
and
i
had
this
last
weekend
at
the
brickstore
where
there
was
a
pronounced
bandaid
taste
happily
my
2007
bottle
is
clean
and
fresh
tasting
nice
aromas
of
sweet
citrus
and
honey
but
a
little
light
the
taste
has
more
oomph
with
the
same
sweet
orange
and
honey
but
with
more
vibrancy
and
the
addition
of
some
floral
flavors
reminiscent
of
wildflower
honey
not
overly
sweet
as
there
is
a
nice
bitter
flavor
to
balance
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
abit
sweet
but
very
clean
and
not
sticky
at
all
quite
nice
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
no
hotness
at
all
even
with
the
fairly
big
abv
overall
it
was
not
bad
by
any
means
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tasting
maybe
it
was
better
fresh
or
maybe
it
needs
a
couple
years
to
figure
it
self
out
either
way
it
was
an
above
average
beer
but
nowhere
near
the
big
flavorful
barley
wines
i
have
had
in
the
past
i
would
say
grab
one
and
sit
on
it
and
see
what
happens
definitely
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
real
ale
bc
not
that
they
do
any
bad
beers
but
the
sisyphus
is
a
rung
higher
on
their
ladder
than
the
others
a
fine
example
of
the
american
barleywine
seek
this
out
and
give
it
a
try
i
got
a
couple
of
2007
bottles
in
a
recent
trade
with
mhewes
thanks
nice
simple
label
hopefully
the
beer
speaks
for
itself
the
color
is
a
nice
cloudy
orange
and
has
smells
like
candy
cherries
and
syrup
a
slight
bit
of
fumes
the
flavor
is
interesting
at
first
and
then
a
little
medicinalaspirin
and
then
hoppy
bitterness
it
seems
hot
but
it
does
have
a
nice
cinnamon
flavor
which
is
weird
and
as
it
wamrs
it
starts
to
taste
better
it
feels
warming
once
it
hits
the
stomach
i
am
going
to
let
the
other
bottle
sit
for
awhile
to
see
if
this
tames
it
down
some
served
in
my
dfh
snifter

is
sugary

with
dark

raisinsprunes
and
a
slight
bready
quality
taste
similar
to

so
sugary
sweet
as
well
as
a
hint
of
caramel
extremely
viscous
mouthfeel
almost
syrupy
followed
by
a
little
bitterness
at
the
finish
drinkability
is
somewhat
limited
by
its
consistency
and
abv
which
was
surprisingly
wellhidden
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
on
the
thin
side
and
the
carbonation
is
lowappropriate
for
a
bwsaand
it
finishes
on
the
tart
side
because
of
the
dark
fruit
pretty
tasty
fresh
and
i
could
see
this
would
be
interesting
as
to
where
it
would
go
with
a
bit
of
aging
on
it
im
certainly
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
drinkability
this
is
a
sipper
if
the
taste
matched
the
aroma
it
would
be
a
much
better
beer
i
wish
i
had
another
one
to
lay
down
for
awhile
worth
a
try
d
big
thanks
to
jdv
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
one
of
the
best
so
far
for
me
big
thanks
to
jonathanl9870
for
this
one
sisyphus
pours
rather
thick
it
does
have
a
rather
pleasant
copper
color
very
light
carbonation
with
very
little
head
and
even
less
retention
a
powerful
malty
aroma
with
distinct
smell
of
raisins
the
first
sips
were
slightly
sour
as
i
continued
to
drink
it
the
sweetness
really
piqued
my
taste
buds
the
mouth
feel
wasnt
quite
my
to
my
liking
but
not
bad
overall
the
complex
vanilla
caramel
and
raisin
flavors
complimented
more
than
contradicted
all
in
all
a
good
beer
from
a
good
brewery
drinking
the
2009
version
in
early
2011
i
find
that
this
version
has
resolved
the
carbonation
issues
i
noted
earlier
so
i
am
bumping
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
scores
by
5
2007

really
thick

particularly
for
the
abv
slightly
hazy

with
mild

in
the
background
kind
of
weird
but
interesting
more
malt
in
the
flavour
caramel
sweetness
with
moderate
bitterness
hop
flavour
was
forward
again
with
the
herbal
character
sort
of
reminded
me
of
the
grassyherbal
flavour
of
jagermeister
just
not
as
intense
heavy
body
with
fine
low
carbonation
alcohol
was
restrained
and
mostly
contributed
a
pleasant
warmth
and
hint
of
spice
in
the
finish
definitely
not
a
clone
of
every
other
american
bw
out
there
the
herbal
quality
really
sets
this
one
apart
it
was
kind
of
strange
at
first
but
it
really
grew
on
me
and
came
into
its
own
as
it
warmed
its
not
an
undrinkable
beer
but
could
be
better
called
an
american
strong
aleor
even
a
winter
barleywine
the
spice
is
simply
overwhelming
this
beer
and
while
its
not
bad
tasting
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
barleywine
2007
pours
a
hazy
rusty
copper
in
color
a
small
cream
and
butter
colored
creamy
head
fades
to
a
ring
aroma
is
raisins
and
sweet
plums
sugary
caramel
maltiness
and
a
mildly
bourbony
alcohol
taste
is
a
light
fruitiness
some
berries
and
cotton
candy
and
sugary
maltiness
some
light
appley
tartness
blends
well
with
the
sugary
caramel
malts
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
somewhat
sticky
sugariness
coats
the
mouth
creamy
full
feel
from
the
large
malt
content
and
low
levels
of
creamy
carbonation
some
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
as
well
great
barleywine
easy
to
drink
but
then
i
love
barleywines
would
love
to
lay
one
down
for
24
years
and
let
it
thin
out
a
bit
thanks
steve
for
the
opportunity
enjoyable
but
i
think
the
abv
is
going
to
prevent
me
from
saying
its
drinkable
per
se
still
very
very
solid
from
one
of
my
favorite
texan
breweries
glad
i
have
another
of
these
stashed
away
thanks
to
ricksawyer
for
the
opportunity
a
bottle
of
2007
that
pours
a
slight
hazy
amberorange
with
little
to
no
head
smells
big
and
boozey
with
a
good
fruitiness
to
it
maybe
candied
apricots
also
some
rich
malts
in
the
nose
taste
is
much
mellower
than
expected
slightly
silky
on
the
tongue
refined
malts
with
a
little
carmel
and
toffee
well
balanced
with
the
hops
which
are
tough
to
discern
ends
with
a
really
nice
warmth
very
enjoyable
would
have
really
liked
to
tried
this
one
fresh
to
compare
it
to
this
very
smooth
drinking
could
easily
sip
this
throughout
the
night
had
the
2007
on
tap
at
rutz
in
houston
and
wow
what
a
difference
from
the
2006
taste
is
more
reminiscent
of
that
barley
wine
taste
youd
expect
much
harsher
on
the
alcohol
side
than
before
drinking
from
a
bottle
i
get
the
same
thing
this
variant
almost
seems
to
be
a
different
beer
to
me
drink
ability
is
still
there
but
im
more
hessitent
with
it
now
not
something
you
want
to
over
drink
in
a
session
and
hard
to
go
through
fast
i
got
to
the
bar
late
and
it
was
one
of
two
places
in
texas
they
said
that
got
a
keg
of
the
07
so
got
one
glass
drink
it
last
call
got
another
thinking
theyd
let
me
finish
but
no
had
to
slam
it
and
it
was
a
challenge
nice
amber
body
topped
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
isnt
as
strong
as
id
like
it
has
a
bit
of
malt
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
has
a
good
spicy
malt
base
with
nice
bitterness
the
balance
is
great
the
body
is
a
touch
light
for
a
barleywine
but
its
about
medium
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
balanced
barleywine
very
easy
to
drink

dylan
d
ok
this
beer
is
slow
to
drink
definitely
a
sipper
i
cant
see
having
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
judged
on
the
basis
of
this
2007
bottle
seems
like
a
perfect
candidate
for
cellaring
to
round
out
the
body
alas
i
only
have
this
one
d
one
of
the
most
drinkable
barley
wines
i
have
ever
had
nice
heavy
mouthfeel
expected
for
a
barleywine
with
excellent
viscosity
almost
has
the
feel
of
a
lightmedium
body
dessert
wine
fresh
balanced
malty
taste
with
good
hop
aroma
although
masked
by
slight
overabundance
of
alcohol
wellmade
solid
effort
very
good
id
recommend
it
i
had
this
ontap
at
the
austin
gingerman
overall
i
really
liked
the
maltiness
in
this
beer
but
i
thought
it
could
have
used
a
bit
more
hop
bitterness
d
pretty
good
this
is
more
sweet
than
i
normally
drink
but
then
again
i
dont
drink
barleywines
all
the
time
real
ale
have
been
doing
good
things
and
this
is
one
of
them
id
have
it
again
and
regret
not
grabbing
it
while
it
was
on
tap
theres
always
next
christmas
i
suppose
check
it
out
if
you
can
find
it
poured
into
an
imperial

the

head
tightens
up
to
about

and
holds
steady
with
nice
lacing
for
the
style
aroma
is
syrupy
sweet
with
some
fruity
alcohol
notes
but
not
overpowering
by
any
means
for
an
11
5abv
taste
exhibits
sweetness
firstly
fading
to
the
fruity
alcohol
which
is
a
bit
more
pronounced
than
the
nose
led
to
believe
lots
of
warming
going
on
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
pretty
good
for
the
style
although
the
sweetness
becomes
a
bit
offputting
as
warming
occurs
and
youll
not
be
having
many
of
these
in
a
sitting
although
the
complexities
make
revisiting
a
cool
option
at
another
time
good
barleywine
d
my
first
barley
wine
so
i
cant
comment
much
about
the
style
but
i
know
the
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
was
a
little
too
much
for
me
keep
on
truckin
real
ale
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
im
interested
in
tasting
how
it
ages
pours
out
an
orangey
honey
with
a
thin
ring
of
head
and
tiny
spots
of
lace
nose
is
of
brown
sugar
plums
sherry
and
grassy
hops
the
plums
come
out
in
full
force
in
the
flavor
high
piloncillo
sweetness
is
perceived
i
get
touches
of
melon
and
a
grassy
hop
finish
with
some
nice
bitterness
on
the
back
some
alcohol
warmth
but
it
is
impressively
subdued
considering
the
gravity
on
this
one
good
flavors
here
but
id
like
a
little
more
complexity
i
guess
mouthfeel
is
thick
syrupy
and
has
an
eversogentle
carbonation
tasty
beer
but
the
sweetness
holds
me
back
from
giving
this
a
higher
drinkability
far
from
a
good
barleywine
sisyphus
has
everything
except
flavor
it
just
doesnt
taste
like
much
of
anything
it
feels
wonderful
but
goes
down
like
thick
muddy
water
the
2007
exhibits
almost
no
positive
flavor
but
given
the
time
its
been
sitting
around
since
it
was
bottled
maybe
in
majestic
liquors
coolers
maybe
not
i
can
sympathize
this
is
supported
by
my
review
in
2007
the
2008
does
have
some
good
fresh
hops
but
not
even
enough
for
an
american
pale
ale
so
maybe
its
an
english
barleywine
i
still
think
its
weak
if
this
is
the
best
that
the
boys
at
real
ale
can
churn
up
then
they
need
to
hire
a
real
brewmaster
at
least
it
wasnt
really
overpriced
good
job
real
ale
this
gets
better
each
year
its
a
shame
it
gets
such
a
small
limited
release
hahahaha
a
case
was
sent
to
my
local
after
talking
to
my
head
beer
honcho
of
the
whole
city

a
dark

has
a
constent
foam
layer
the
aromas
that
emanate
are
fanfreakintastic
yahoo
maybe
shes
sleepy
for
an
american
barleywine
this
has
to
be
the
most
drinkable
in
all
of
man
kind
i
could
drink
this
after
a
90
min
soccer
game
or
with
breakfast
in
the
morning
its
that
fckin
good
and
smooth
balnced
and
tasty
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
even
considers
a
barleywine
once
and
a
while
because
this
is
the
definition
of
beauty
by
the
way
is
this
really
11
tried
a
bottle
right
off
the
shelf
being
in
austin
ive
tried
quite
a
few
real
ale
brews
and
have
found
them
to
be
inconsistant
sometimes
pours
a
copper
body
off
white
head
and
little
carbonation
a
very
vicous
pour
smell
is
toffee
caramel
hints
of
fruit
and
alcohol
lurkinghops
are
understated
but
have
a
nice
bit
of
pinecitrus
aroma
to
them
tastes
like
the
smellfairly
sweet
with
the
toffe
and
brown
sugar
and
almost
being
too
sweet
and
then
being
rescued
by
some
piney
hops
that
finish
in
the
back
of
the
throat
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
this
beer
coats
the
entire
mouth
fairly
drinkable
but
maybe
a
little
syrupy
to
have
more
than
2
overall
a
very
good
effort
by
real
ale
taste
is
smooth
creamy
friendly
earthy
sweetness
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
mild
grassy
hop
finish
not
cloying
or
overly
hopped
like
many
barley
wines
seem
to
be
very
balanced
and
a
bit
tame
but
the
drinkability
is
high
hops
kick
in
a
touch
more
as
it
warms
and
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
nice
beer
and
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
one
ages
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
real
ale
has
never
really
wowed
me
until
i
tasted
this
beer
i
am
going
to
the
store
tomorrow
to
buy
them
out
for
such
a
big
beer
its
rather
drinkable
i
wanted
to
let
it
sit
another
year
but
curiosity
got
the
best
of
me
certainly
a
good
american
barleywine
that
fans
of
the
style
should
seek
out
definitely
the
most
impressive
beer
ive
had
yet
from
the
state
of
texas
on
tap
at
opal
devines
in
austin
pours
a
deep
hazy
orangey
amber
with
minimal
head
aroma
is
sweet
with
significant
fruity
hop

is
well
hidden
in
the
tasty
malthop
balance
tons
of
both
not
unlike
a
well
aged
bigfoot
the
best
beer
brewed
in
texas
i
cant
think
of
one
thats
better
still
struggling
with
the
american
hops
but
i
know
a
good
brew
when
i
taste
one
drinkable
yummy
tasty
as
all
hell
but
i
do
wonder
if
this
wouldve
been
better
fresh
maybe
not
ill
never
know
regardless
it
was
fitting
i
drink
this
one
year
removed
i
like
it
very
much
but
i
think
i
like
the
gesture
much
more
sometimes
the
pursuit
of
great
beer
is
kind
of
silly
and
superficial
but
ill
never
forget
sisyphus
thank
you
again
assurbanipaul
this
was
a
special
beer
from
tx
sip
on
this
for
a
while
cause
it
packs
a
punch
mouthfeel
is
warming
but
still
slightly
raw
i
would
recommend
sitting
on
this
for
23
years
and
hope
it
turns
out
like
that
vintage

been
letting
this

abv
a
very
refreshing
barleywine
definitely
americanstyle
i
would
have
no
problem
putting
back
one
or
two
more
of
these
in
an
evening
but
instead
i
will
cellar
the
other
i
obtained
for
a
year
or
so
time
will
make
this
offering
from
real
ale
that
much
more
enjoyable
opinion
this
is
a
no
kidding
around
kind
of
beer
this
beer
comes
across
as
big
to
me
the
whole
way
through
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
big
beers
but
this
one
is
almost
over
the
top
the
flavor
is
so
assertive
with
hops
right
now
that
your
palate
is
ringing
this
doesnt
let
you
taste
much
else
it
would
probably
be
pretty
darn
good
after
two
years
when
the
hop
character
mellows
out
to
let
the
malt
through
this
bw
has
good
drinkability
now
and
i
think
it
will
improve
nice
warming
effect
the
liquid
is
very
smooth
and
it
slides
right
down
good
local
beer
and
one
i
look
forward
to
having
again
drinkability
as
concentrated
as
the
flavor
is
the
overall
effect
is
mellow
and
easy
to
quaff

well
ive
had
a

it

better
than

and
aged
barleywines
ive
tasted
wait
a

as
ive
noticed
no

at

the
beer
after
its

departure
from
the
12ounce
bottle
sets
in
my
stone

glass
as
this
bad
boy
deserves
a
special

a
deep
hazy
orange
with
a
minimal

it
evanesces
the
residual

spiciness
also
noted
and
a

presage
of
whats

the

middling
in
its

is
modestly
acidic
the

strong
and
the
10

itself

somewhat
bitter

waiting
for
my
thanks
to
travis

this

this
is

thing

you
its

this

makes
me
think
of
lightly
fizzy

blended
well
with

the

will
probably
go
up
as

all
the
wonderful
beers

gentle
pour

body
beneath
a
creamy
head
of
ivory
colored
foam
as
far
as
barleywines
go

retention
is
good

it
leaves
some
nice

about

malt

peppered

and
then
softened
by

always
backed
by
a
solid
bitterness
its
not
overtly
complex
but
its
rich
and
satisfying
in
a
big
way
alcohol
however
starts
to
become
apparent
after
a
few
sips
and
bitterness
begins
to
build
in
the

beyond
that
still
its

in

was
obvious
in

didnt
have
quite
the

warming
effect
in
the
mouth
as
north

stock
tasted
earlier
in
the
evening
there
had
been
some
maturation
of
the
flavors
with

the
bitterness
and
floral
flavors
from
the
edgy
hops
still
stood
out
from
the
malt
but
melded
into
something
almost
reminiscent
of
an
india
pale

with
a
kick

it
shouldnt
be
aged

a

color
with
a
thin
offwhite

that
disappeared
rather
quickly
strong

in

flavor
packs
a
real
punch
especially
as
it
warms
fruity
alcohol
flavor
with
a
decent
malt
balance
as
strong
as
this
beer
tastes
i
still
think
it
is
balanced
quite
well
i
bet
the
caskconditioned
version
of
this
beer
rocks
cloudy
yellowbrown
with
lots
of
suspended
sediment
head
is
fairly
large
offwhite
and
perhaps
an
inch
thick
several
minutes
after
pouring
at
least
a
quarter
of
an
inch
remains
with
quite
prominent
thick
lace
the
aroma
is
utterly
dominated
by
the
strong
alcohol
strong
bitter
grapefruit
hops
notes
are
also
present
along
with
fruity
esters
taste
yields
sweet
malt
flavors
fruit
flavors
pears
quite
rough
alcohol
notes
and
bitter
grapefruit
hops
which
linger
on
long
past
the
end
of
the
taste
this
particular
sample
has
been
cellared
for
about
six
months
so
it
seems
that
if
it
is
to
mellow
some
greater
inverval
of
time
will
be
required
still
as
a
texan
i
have
to
admire
the
fact
that
a
texas
brewery
has
taken
up
the
challenge
of
producing
a
barleywine
ale
cloudy
medium
brown
with
a
moderate
head
fades
to
a
nice
weather
patten
im
not
seeing
the
presence
of
alcohol
in
the
aroma
like
has
been
mentioned
by
others
a
seet
malt
dominates
the
nose
along
with
somethign
like
strawberries
past
their
prime
and
maybe
a
slight
bit
of
banana
the
alcohol
kicks
in
a
bit
in
the
flavor
and
seems
unbalanced
at
first
combined
with
the
bitter
grapefruit
peel
hops
but
fades
into
the
malt
further
into
the
glass
the
alcohol
is
only
truly
noticed
by
the
mild
burn
as
it
travels
to
the
stomach
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
a
bit
soft
and
with
the
alcoholic
warmth
make
this
a
comforting
beer
great
for
relaxing
the
only
real
drawback
is
the
malt
is
slightly
unbalanced
by
the
bitterness
of
the
alcohol
and
hops
im
glad
that
i
have
two
bottles
so
that
i
can
see
how
this
turns
out
in
a
year
or
two
overall
a
little
less
sweet
than
im
used
to
for
a
barleywine
but
still
a
nice
full
flavour
the
hos
still
have
some
bite
but
the
beer
still
seems
pretty
smooth
guessing
the
age
has
mellowed
this
one
an
okay
beer
but
not
even
close
the
the
heads
of
the
class
a
decent
beer
when
aged
but
it
just
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
going
on
at
the
2year
mark
in
my
opinion
and
ive
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
prefer
it
fresh
pretty
good
beer
especially
for
the
price
worth
getting
a
few
to
age
and
for
3
99
a
bottle
not
a
bad
go
to
option
old
boardhead
is
a
big
sweet
and
slightly
hoppy
barleywine
available
for
dirt
cheap
if
those
words
resonate
with
you
jump
on
this
beer
it
wont
blow
you
away
but
its
inexpensive
boozy
and
tasty
sometimes
that
just
hits
the
mark
its
almost
the
malt
liquor
of
the
craft
beer
world
o
for
the
price
its
worth
it

similar
aroma
much
more
of
a
dark
fruitraisin
aroma
and
a
bit
oxidized
no
hops
at
all
in
the
smell
flavor
isnt
as
sweet
still
wood
and
spicy
much
less
of
an
alcohol
bite
mouthfeel
not
syrupy
or
sweet
as
before
this
one
aged
into
a
solid
barleywine
o
average
bwine
but
for
6
a
bomber
you
cant
go
wrong
medium
bodied
with
tight
carbonation
and
a
very
dry
and
bitter
hop
presence
that
lingers
over
the
sweeter
notes
and
malt
backbone
into
a
boozy
finish
lots
of
sticky
hops
up
front
that
are
somewhat
stale
at
this
stage
followed
by
leathery
malt
caramel
toffee
and
dark
fruit
a
decent
amount
of
sweet
boozy
flavor
in
the
finish
but
the
high
abv
is
actually
pretty
well
masked
overall
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
its
kind
of
bland
and
not
very
memorable
recommended
this
is
a
relatively
lightbodylight
tasting
barleywine
smells
almost
like
a
xmas
cookie
but
without
being
overly
sugary
or
spicey
although
i
would
say
theres
a
slight
cinammonallspice
note
in
there
a
light
roasted
malt
flavor
holds
this
thing
together
the
high
alcohol
content
is
wellhidden
within
the
flavor
profile
certainly
an
excellent
barleywine
offering
drinkability
i
dont
know
if
itd
be
proper
to
call
a
9
barleywine
easygoing
but
this
certainly
is
not
insanely
intense
overall
with
a
good
balance
of
sweetness
and
finishing
bitterness
that
makes
this
one
a
version
to
try
now
though
id
be
interested
to
see
what
happens
in
a
few
years
with
the
good
pqr
if
i
find
another
one
ill
do
just

of

and
dark

taste
is
sweet

caramel
hint
of

nice
medium

creamy
this
appears
to
be
heavier
bodied
and
better
flavored
than
the
one
i
sampled
a
year
earlier
i
will
return
to
this
again
and
cellar
a
few
o
aside
from
the
appearance
which
is
lovely
this
beer
is
quite
pedestrian
across
the
board
no
pun
intended
doesnt
taste
like
a
barleywine
doesnt
even
taste
like
an
ipa
just
a
straightup
hoppy
imperial
brown
ale
is
the
only
way
i
can
describe
it
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
just
not
what
one
expects
when
drinking
a
barleywine
pours
a
hazy
apricot
with
a
dissipating
cap
of
tannish
head
and
striking
lacing
the
aroma
is
much
more
maltcentric
than
i
would
expect
i
was
anticipating
a
very
west
coast
american
barleywine
but
this
features
mainly
dark
sweet
malt
caramel
toffee
reminiscent
of
an
old
ale
nevertheless
its
nice
the
taste
paints
a
different
picture
the
hops
are
on
the
front
lines
supported
by
malt
bits
similar
to
those
found
in
the
nose
this
one
drinks
pretty
easy
for
the
style
pretty
good
certainly
not
worldclass
reddish
brown
copper
color
thin
layer
of
frothy
tanbrown
foam
very
floral
still
plenty
of
sweet
caramel
and
typical
aged
barleywine
notes
of
oxidized
malt
and
sherry
sweet
upfront
with
big
caramel
malt
flavors
becoming
dry
in
the
aftertaste
big
and
burly
low
carbonation
if
anything
time
has
muted
the
alcohol
bite
not
sure
id
recommend
aging
for
4
years
based
on
this
sample
overall
good
american
style
barleywine
reminds
me
of
strong
malty
ipa
kinda
missing
that
dark
fruitiness
that
i
like
maybe
i
prefer
english
style
taste
is
sour
and
tart
its
just
a
horrible
drain
pour
mouthfeel
is
light
and
super
sharp
very
bad
o
solid
beer
but
i
was
surprised
at
how
bitter
it
was
very
hoppy
for
being
many
months
old
when
i
drank
it
overall
quite
tasty
i
prefer
a
bit
less
hops
in
my
barleywines
but
as
mentioned
its
a
west
coast
offering
so
i
certainly
wasnt
expecting
less
hops
overall
its
pretty
well
balanced
just
a
hair
away
form
being
awesome
easily
among
the
lower
end
of
bws
for
me
i
like
em
to
have
a
little
more
malt
character
than
this
too
many
chemical
flavors
to
make
me
happy
a
disappointment
o
a
solid
american
barleywine
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
aged
ive
had
it
a
couple
times
fresh
and
this
was
slightly
improved
but
still
not
incredible
i
almost
think
i
shouldve
let
it
go
for
another
5
years
to
appreciate
it
oh
well
i
want
more
and
when
i
said
sweet
above
not
over
the
top
just
sweeter
sides
of
the
flavors
all
in
all
i
really
like
this
beer
and
cant
wait
to
try
some
more
aged
barley
wines
i
am
going
to
forget
about
the
other
few
bottles
of
this
i
have
for
a
decade
just
for
fun
not
worth
drinking
them
now
o
believe
it
or
not
this
is
my
first
of
the
style
i
quite
enjoyed
it
suffers
from
a
lack
of
umph
4
years
was
too
much
for
this
one
i
think
solid
beer
though
6
210
drink
its
more
like
a
dipa
than
a
barley
wine
but
its
still
better
tan
average
i
think
with
age
this
would
mellow
but
fresh
its
too
hoppybitter
would
like
to
have
a
bottle
to
age
but
wont
lose
sleep
over
not
having
one
pours
the
color
of
iced
tea
with
a
1
inch
light
beige
head
that
fades
to
an
oily
film
random
thick
smears
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
sweet
malt
tea
leaves
and
citrus
zest
the
overall
smell
is
somewhat
muted
taste
is
all
about
the
hops
citrus
zest
is
the
dominant
flavor
with
some
herbal
qualities
and
malt
on
the
finish
pretty
assertive
hop
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
very
dry
and
acidic
mouthfeel
from
the
hops
overall
a
pretty
good
barleywine
that
is
dominated
by
hop
tastes
i
am
glad
i
got
to
pick
one
of
these
up
as
i
have
never
seen
it
in
ca
overall
its
really
good
never
had
it
fresh
but
id
imagine
its
a
little
past
prime
some
things
seem
a
bit
muted
overall
very
nice
flavorful
beer
with
hop
character
which
packs
a
punch
with
its
high
abv
reminded
me
of
some
of
lagunitas
and
fat
tire
ales
pours
bright
and
clear
ruddy
amber
off
white
head
that
leaves
nice
cap
of
lacing
smells
of
mango
sugar
slight
booze
cherry
sweet
malt
taste
is
candylike
artificial
fruit
some
citrus
followed
by
a
pithy
hop
bitterness
that
cleanses
the
sugars
from
the
palate
making
this
a
clean
drinker
carbonation
is
medium
as
is
the
mouthfeel
i
think
that
the
carbonation
is
helping
to
lighten
the
body
making
it
seem
thinner
than
it
actually
is
overall
not
bad
but
i
can
tell
that
the
hop
bitterness
well
get
to
be
too
much
after
one
bomber
o
fantastic
execution
and
complexity
final
notes
ive
had
better
barleywines
than
this
whereas
this
beer
definitely
has
the
hops
its
rather
lacking
in
the
malts
tastes
more
like
an
ipa
to
me
quite
frankly
it
doesnt
taste
bad
or
anything
just
not
a
solid
example
of
the
style
a
decent
barleywine
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
sweet
overall
although
the
nicely
bitter
finish
provides
some
balance
the
alcohol
was
very
wellmasked
i
have
another
2010
sitting
in
the
basement
but
i
dont
feel
compelled
to
stock
up
on
a
bunch
more
although
the
price
of
around
five
bucks
is
very
reasonable
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
price
point
is
perfect
at
about
4
50
i
dont
mind
picking
several
of
these
when
they
are
available
and
aging
them
o
overall
this
looks
like
a
good
beer
smells
like
it
could
be
a
good
beer
although
the
aroma
is
not
very
pervasive
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
as
is
the
taste
overall
this
is
an
average
barleywine
notes
it
sort
of
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
appreciate
the
smoothness
but
a
lack
of
complexity
and
with
only
a
final
bitter
note
emerging
it
felt
a
bit
forgettable
again
maybe
i
would
offer
it
to
someone
willing
to
try
a
barleywine
out
of
the
blue
but
it
may
not
be
such
a
good
idea
after
all
md
this
beer
is
thinner
than
other
barely
wines
i
have
had
lately
but
that
makes
it
far
easier
to
drink
it
goes
down
smooth
and
makes
you
want
another
sip
the
apparent
alcohol
isnt
as
well
covered
because
of
the
lack
of
sweetness
so
its
balance
is
a
little
thrown
off
not
a
bad
pick
especially
for
its
price

a

and

the

is
a
pretty
hardy
caramel
cherry
with
whiskeyoak
and
nutty

very
nice
and
bodes
of
some
happy
danger
the
taste
it
brings
is
not
as
pleasing
as
the
aroma
it
has
a
grassy
overtone
with
light
cherry
and
honey

its
flowery
sweet
and
an
odd
combination
of
medium
bodied
but
a
somewhat
resinous
though
watery
in
feel
pleasantly
carbonated
its
fairly
drinkable
for
the
style
its
nice
but
not
my
favorite
for
a
barleywine
notes
based
on
the
nose
i
thought
i
was
going
to
love
this
brew
but
i
found
the
palate
to
belie
the
nose
and
was
left
with
a
brew
that
feels
thin
and
bitter
lacking
the
dense
chewy
notes
that
i
was
expecting
some
might
dig
this
for
a
change
from
thick
barleywines
but
not
me
a
4
5
s
4
t
3
5
m

o
4
5
d
high
abv
makes
it
tough
to
finish
off
a
bottle
alone
and
theres
too
much
heat
this
barleywine
would
definitely
benifit
from
some
age
on
it
i
remember
liking
this
more
previously
either
my
tastes
in
barleywine
have
changed
or
their
recipe
has
its
really
way
to
hoppy
for
a
barleywine
although
that
could
translate
to
a
more
interestingly
aged
beer
as
it
is
it
has
an
almost
bad
ipa
linger
and
is
not
easy
to
drink
most
of
the
bite
comes
from
the
hops
with
alcohol
being
well
hidden
from
the
taste
and
only
a
gentle
warming
sensation
very
little
redeeming
this
unless
you
prefer
overhopped
versions
of
every
style
drinkability
bitterness
is
a
little
intense
but
not
in
a
bad
way
very
nice
complexity
and
overall
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
medium
full
with
a
creamy
amount
of
carbonation
d
this
is
pretty
good
a
great
value
at
4
39
for
a
22oz
beer
drinkability
its
nothing
like
any
barleywine
ive
had
before
way
hoppier
than
was
expecting
and
this
isnt
a
bad
thing
necessarily
unless
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
good
barleywine
i
probably
should
buy
a
couple
more
to
let
them
mellow
with
age
d
very
good
a
great
sipping
beer
for
christmas
eve
in
front
of
the
fireplace
i
have
not
had
a
barleywine
in
awhile
but
this
one
makes
me
want
to
go
try
some
more
soon
overall
this
is
the
first
barleywine
ive
ever
tried
and
im
impressed
reminds
me
alot
of
a
dipa
4
for
a
22oz
barleywine
sounds
like
a
great
deal
but
this
is
hardly
a
barleywine

a
dazzling
transparent
mahogany
brown
with
a
puffy
white

that
shows
decent
retention
and
lacing
for
the
abv
smell
is
soso
mainly
caramel
malts
cotton
candy
and
toffee
complex
malt
and
hop
flavors
but
incredibly
underwhelming
for
a
relatively
fresh
9
barleywinethis
is
like
bigfoot
with
the
volume
turned
way
way
down
mouthfeel
is
actually
outstanding
but
just
too
mellow
overall
i
dont
know
what
happened
but
this
beer
is
completely
lacking
in
the
instensity
and
flavor
i
expect
from
a
barleywine
a
very
representative
example
of
what
i
like
in
a
new
world
barleywine
weighty
but
well
divided
between
the
dousing
malt
and
supportive
sanityproviding
fruity
bitter
hops
still
moderately
crazy
in
its
own
right
and
plenty
drinkable
by
the
same
measure
a
barleywine
should
be
stronger
every
time
you
decide
to
reach
for
a
barleywine
youre
taking
a
gamble
we
all
generally
know
what
to
expect
strong
overpowering
taste
followed
by
a
intense
kick
usually
the
kick
should
get
stronger
throughout
the
night
hence
the
9
alcohol
content
in
most
barleywines
however
this
one
was
a
disappointment
the
only
attribute
i
applaud
is
the
drinkability
because
of
its
obvious
lack
of
lingering
barleywineish
kick
we
have
a
barleywine
here
thats
quite
enjoyable
to
enjoy
enjoy
and
then
enjoy
some
more
of
cheers
and
watch
out
for
the
headache

brown
sugar
and
dark
fruits
it
is
nicely
balanced
by
a
huge
blast
of
northwest
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
and
somewhat
smooth
drinkability
is
very
good
no
sign
of
the
9
0
abv
as
this
brew
has
mellowed
very
well
over
the
last
three
years
glad
to
have
tried
it
edit
had
several
of
these
since
my
review
and
while
still
good
they
seems
to
be
a
little
inconsistent
in
the
flavor
department
drink
is
great
if
aged
thats
for
sure
but
new
its
still
a
little
hot
pours
slightly
hazy
with
a
reddish
orangeish
amber
color
about
a
halffinger
of
creamy
smooth
head
very
little
carbonation
and
excellent
lacing
nose
is
mostly
apple
cider
with
maybe
a
little
vanilla
and
pineapple
floating
around
in
there
flavor
is
very
apple
ciderish
tangysweet
and
carrying
a
larger
malt
component
finishes
long
and
hop
bitter
in
a
good
way
very
good
beer
also
wellpriced
at
4
49bomber
worth
tracking
down
an
enjoyable
beer
for
sure
but
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
i
think
sierra
nevadas
is
better
as
one
example
thanks
again
to
the
market
of
choice
for
stocking
this
beer
a
nice
amber
that
fades
into
a
dark
iced
tea
color
there
was
a
lot
of
fruit
flavor
like
raisin
and
fig
a
lot
of
brown
sugar
overtones
but
doesnt
kill
the
sweetness
very
hoppy
this
was
a
wow
beer
to
me
i
would
drink
several
more
of
this
beer
given
the
opportunity
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
fresh
barleywine
i
wish
i
had
the
cellar
space
to
age
one
or
two
of
these
but
alas
things
are
tight
right
now
it
would
be
a
great
one
to
age
for
a
couple
years
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
nice
amber
color
with
deep
reds
when
held
to
the
light
along
with
a
2
finger
off
white
head
that
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
while
settling
to
a
decent
cap
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
fruits
with
plum
and
apricot
present
along
with
a
good
balance
of
malts
present
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
up
front
with
a
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
well
balanced
not
too
much
notice
for
the
alcohol
content
as
masked
by
the
dark
fruit
taste
of
raisin
and
plum
decent
brew
but
not
overwhelmingly
good
tastes
malty
sweet
with
tame
hop
flavor
and
strong
hop
grassiness
powerful
carbonation
mixes
with
the
hop
bitter
to
wipe
the
sweet
clean
in
the
finish
malt
flavor
has
a
bit
of
brown
character
with
very
mild
caramel
hop
flavor
is
noticable
in
its
absence
hop
bitter
is
more
grassy
edge
than
the
clean
biter
i
like
in
a
big
hoppy
beer
flavor
doesnt
hold
up
to
what
the
aroma
promised
and
in
fact
falls
short
in
general
woody
dry
finish
with
some
not
so
clean
alcohol
edge
jumping
in
too
light
body
and
strong
carbonation
i
hope
this
beer
develops
over
time
as
i
have
a
vertical
from
2003
going
an
excellent
barleywine
assuming
you
give
it
3
years
of
aging
fresh
it
is
nothing
special
aged
it
is
quite
good
drinkability
worth
the
money
the
alcohol
is
not
present
and
its
worth
a
try
this
was
a
good
beer
with
good
drinkability
i
would
happily
enjoy
another
bottle
along
with
lagunitas
olde
gnarlywine
and
sn
bigfoot
this
is
one
of
the
better
barley
wine
values
out
there
not
as
good
as
the
other
two
but
good
nonetheless
dark
amber
color
with
a
decent
white
head
aromas
of
raisins
hops
and
booze
on
the
palate
pretty
similar
with
a
little
caramel
as
well
d
the
dryness
certainly
helps
make
the
sweetness
easier
to
digest
at
9
this
is
fairly
easy
going
drinkability
pretty
good
as
barleywines
go
its
neither
overpowering
nor
cloying
it
is
drinkable
for
its
strength
dark
brown
body
light
tan
head
minimal
head
no
retention
nose
is
a
bit
sweet
but
still
a
lot
of
hop
presence
floral
caramel
and
bready
malts
the
taste
was
exceptional
very
well
balanced
not
a
cloying
but
pleasant
sweetness
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
full
mouthfeel
good
effervescence
nice
job
of
cellaring
abv
extremely
well
hidden
quite
drinkable
one
of
the
better
brews
i
had
a
fredfest
thanks
to
john
harris
et
al
for
pulling
this
out
of
the
cellar
for
this
special
event
certainly
makes
me
want
to
stash
a
bottle
for
a
decade
or
so
d
pretty
strong
stuff
so
not
a
session
beer
but
a
very
enjoyable
treat
from
full
sail
d
surely
a
sipper
as
well
the
aging
has
given
this
beer
a
real
nice
balance
i
wasnt
blown
away
but
it
is
a
very
good
barleywine
overall
nice
rich
and
sweet
nose
some
grass
and
herb
notes
but
much
more
sweet
fruit
and
spice
rich
and
silky
on
the
palate
with
great
sweetness
and
firm
finish
alcohol
is
high
but
not
really
noticeable
good
effort
here
not
something
to
pick
up
again
this
was
an
average
and
fairly
boring
example
of
what
a
balrey
wine
is
bigfoot
is
similarly
priced
but
way
better
with
similar
hops
i
would
recommend
the
bigfoot
over
this
any
day
pretty
solid
drinkability
overall
above
average
for
the
style
but
not
a
standout
at
all
a
solid
barleywine
nice
flavors
with
good
bitterness
to
counter
quite
drinkable
except
for
the
fairly
strong
alcohol
mouthfeel
was
a
tad
thin
but
overall
very
enjoyable
im
glad
this
had
at
least
a
year
on
it
im
not
sure
i
would
would
have
liked
this
as
much
with
fresher
piney
hops
and
hotter
alcohol
hop
heads
will
want
this
fresh
but
i
think
more
age
could
only
make
this
better
definitely
a
good
one
to
keep
in
your
cellar
for
a
couple
years
mouthfeel
even
more
some
potential
tart
fruit
bitterness
grows
drinkability
is
tough
its
a
challenging
beer
although
one
of
the
cheapest
in
this
format
d
aged
this
was
the
2008
vintage
this
beer
isnt
as
sugary
and
alcoholic
tasting
as
other
barleywines
ive
had
recently
a
sipper
and
probably
not
something
one
should
have
more
than
a
22oz
because
of
the
bomber
from
the
last
round
of
no
bs
nice
big
body
smooth
and
mild
carbonation
a
nice
sipper
but
i
will
have
no
problem
sipping
my
way
thru
this
bomber
o
artificial
and
thinner
than
other
examples
if
it
is
going
to
be
this
sweet
i
want
it
to
be
thicker
want
more
hops
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
to
reward
yourself
just
wish
it
came
out
more
than
once
a
year
and
had
a
wider
distribution
d
a
well
done
and
affordable
barleywine
from
a
brewery
i
am
just
getting
acquainted
with
could
definitely
use
another
year
or
two
on
it
to
mellow
out
the
alcohol
and
meld
the
hops
and
malt
but
after
thati
see
this
being
a
very
good
barleywine
2008
vintage
bomber
pours
murky
chunky
brown
with
minimal
head
nose
pine
and
leather
a
tad
dusty
taste
a
hop
forward
barleywine
with
an
astringent
aspirin
like
bitterness
some
oxidation
seems
present
so
the
malt
has
a
sweet
carboard
taste
dry
kind
of
lifeless
finish
watery
body
drinkability
likely
better
in
a
fresher
sample
although
this
is
only
a
year
old
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
okay
but
not
for
the
style
its
really
like
a
malty
ipa
overall
a
little
too
bitter
at
the
wrong
times
even
for
a
hophead
like
me
but
this
makes
a
nice
sippernightcap
pours
a
murky
copper
color
with
a
quarter
inch
of
head
that
has
good
retention
moderate
amount
of
spotty

left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
features
the
malt
with
a
rich
caramel
aroma
bready
and
sweet
fruity
esters
grassy
hops
and
alcohol
round
out
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
likewise
rich
and
malty
hints
of
fruit
and
grass
before
the
alcohol
takes
over
hop
bitterness
is
moderate
has
a
great
smooth
texture
and
body
i
enjoyed
this
barleywine
nice
hops
and
subtle
flavors
makes
this
a
worthwhile
choice
from

fairly
complex

tasty
bit

dryness
help
make
sure
this
one
is
sipped
better
than
most
full
sail
at
4
a
bomber
a
hell
of
a
deal
pours
nicely
amber
with
a
really
sticky
foam
not
an
aggressive
hop
in
the
nose
balanced
malt
of
apple

pepper
a

on
the

nose
a
bit
earthy
a
bit
toffee
with
an
herbal
dry
finish
of
a
bitter
clean
enough
to
be
taken
for
a
double
ipa
outside
its
zest
and
body
unfortunately
the
taste
seems
to
have
taken
a
turn
for
the
worse
on
this
one
with
a
metallic
character
now
in
the
place
of
what
i
presume
was
a
hefty
hop
profile
when
fresh
this
is
still
drinking
ok
but
ill
seek
out
a
fresh
bottle
to
try
overall
a
very
solid
barelywine
imo
the
lack
of
hop
fade
made
this
a
true
treat
to
be
an
08
vintage
and
the
mouthfeel
was
good
as
well
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
cheers
to
full
sail
for
making
a
great
brew
and
warming
up
this
chilly
rainy
night
d
pretty
smooth
for
a
barleywine
ale
but
still
has
apparent
alcohol
flavor
that
enhances
the
beer
thanks
john
this
beer
has
held
up
fairly
well
i
havent
had
a
fresh
one
in
some
time
and
cant
remember
enought
to
do
a
fair
comparison
but
at
3
49
ill
probably
buy
a
couple
more
to
see
how
well
it
ages
d
very
good
drinkability
for
this
sipper
i
have
another
2007
bottle
that
im
going
to
hang
on
to
for
a
few
more
years
old
boardhead
is
definitely
a
good
choice
while
this
is
a
hoppy
barleywine
it
is
very
drinkable
its
light
body
makes
for
a
surprisingly
sessionable
strong
brew
drinkability
the
high
abv
obviously
puts
this
beer
into
a
category
where
you
drink
less
but
enjoy
your
beer
more
this
is
a
great
drink
the
beer
pours
a
crimson
burgundy
color
with
some
off
white
head
although
the
head
does
no
stick
around
very
long
i
would
like
a
nice
ring
of
a
bubbles
to
hang
around
while
i
drink
the
smell
is
nice
not
to
malty
very
hop
forward
and
some
booze
but
not
bad
the
taste
is
kind
of
not
to
much
going
on
here
i
taste
the
hops
most
of
all
its
lacking
that
candied
sugar
dried
fruit
flavor
we
all
know
and
love
when
it
comes
to
barley
wines
its
a
bit
to
over
carbonated
to
me
and
kind
of
thin
it
drinks
pretty
good
ill
have
no
problem
finished
the
bomber
my
self
although
four
bucks
for
a
barley
wine
not
bad
overall
full
sail
did
something
decent
here
a
decent
aged
bwine
of
a
few
years
for
the
price
of
this
bomber
id
easily
buy
more
of
it
d
very
easy
drinking
barleywine
nice
and
bitter
not
too
overpowering
but
not
underwhelming
enough
for
me
to
pass
up
on
it
especially
for
the
price
was
a
very
low
priced
22
oz
barleywine
2006
vintage
bomber
poured
dec
07
out
crystal
clear
copper
with
lasting
pillowy
off
white
head
and
copious
lacing
i
love
it
when
barleywines
come
in
bombers
the
aroma
is
a
bit
light
and
tough
to
pin
down
i
get
vague
dark
fruitiness
along
with
a
biscuit
to
hay
like
maltiness
and
vague
sweetness
the
taste
starts
off
sweet
malty
melonodin
and
biscuit
malt
theres
also
dark
fruitiness
mixed
with
hard
candy
cherries
and
oranges
body
seems
thin
d
dangerously
high
drinkability
at
4
19
a
22oz
bomber
for
a
9abv
american
barleywine
the
value
is
fantastic
compared
to
other
even
oregon
breweries
offerings
i
want
more
this
was
quite
good
a
really
nice
example
of
an
american
barleywine
balanced
not
overly
sweet
or
hoppy
would
gladly
drink
this
one
again
pours
a
deep
and
rich
orange
with
a
white
head
that
diminishes
to
a
collar
and
leaves
a
few
streaks
of
lace
classic
american
bwine
nose
of
citrus
mixing
in
with
toffee
is
also
joined
by
light
floral
notes
light
citrus
orange
and
grapefruit
gives
a
decent
bitterness
at
first
sip
but
this
soon
gives
way
to
a
big
toffee
body
with
lots
of
brown
sugar
spicy
and
warming
finish
points
to
the
alcohol
which
is
otherwise
wellconcealed
mouthfeel
is
just
below
full
with
a
light
and
smooth
carbonation
straightforward
and
easily
drinkable
i
liked
this
one
this
deep
brown
beer
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
giving
a
fair
amount
of
foam
then
reducing
to
a
light
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
of
ripe
fruits
malt
slight
hop
molassas
greet
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
that
of
molassas
malt
slight
alcohol
burn
and
crisp
malt
overall
a
great
low
priced
barleywine
ale
i
totally
thought
that
this
would
be
better
than
it
is
if
i
ever
get
the
chance
ill
try
another
bottle
in
case
there
may
be
something
wrong
with
this
one
if
that
one
tastes
the
same
i
wont
drink
another
one
though
the
alcohol
was
in
the
forefront
here
also
had
a
funky
taste
throughout
kind
of
bitter
and
medicinal
alcoholic
heat
that
stood
out
quite
a
bit
especially
considering
the
relatively
low
abv
given
that
it
was
a
barley
wine
there
is
a
bit
of
fruit
in
here
to
be
fair
with
little
caramel
malts
dont
think
i
will
revisit
this
one
drink
ability
is
very
high
for
a
barleywine
very
flavorful
and
complex
alcohol
is
hidden
well
glad
i
bought
some
more
to
cellar
for
a
year
the
alcohol
is
well
blended
with
only
a
faint
hint
of
heat
at
the
back
of
the
throat
everybody
has
their
own
particular
tastes
and
there
is
no
doubt
certain
general
qualities
do
make
certain
beers
in
certain
style
categories
qualitatively
better
in
some
sense
but
i
dont
see
barleywines
getting
too
much
better
than
this
one
perhaps
ive
had
enough
barleywines
that
my
bar
is
set
pretty
high
but
ive
been
turned
off
by
lots
of
my
recent
new
barleywine
experiences
old
boardhead
isnt
a
total
disaster
and
im
willing
to
think
perhaps
this
is
just
a
bad
bottle
somehow
i
got
something
out
of
it
but
id
be
hesitant
to
return
shoulda
had
one
on
tap
when
i
was
in
hood
river
last
month
but
instead
i
thought
ah
ive
got
a
bottle
at
home
so
ill
try
something
else
im
a
dummy
md
medium
bodied
a
little
on
the
light
side
of
what
i
expect
from
barleywines
alcohol
is
very
strong
and
knocks
the
drinkability
down
a
touch
the
taste
was
slightly
tangy
ever
so
slight
bitterness
to
it
with
a
citrusy
taste
d
one
is
enough
for
one
night
dnot
real
impressed
with
this
the
aroma
is
really
a
unimpressive
average
at
best
as
is
the
body
tastes
ok
for
an
esb
or
something
along
those
lines
but
is
not
up
to
par
for
a
barley
wine
d
the
big
piney
hops
have
some
full
pungency
to
them
which
is
nice
but
overpowers
the
malt
to
much
and
moreso
as
the
beer
warms
i
think
with
a
few
years
of
age
this
would
be
a
different
beer
but
im
not
sure
there
is
enough
malt
to
make
it
an
interesting
beer
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
very
cloudy
dark
rubyamber
great
frothy
tan
head
on
top
retention
was
firm
and
it
left
a
good
bit
of
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
scents
of
molasses
soy
urine
and
toffee
different
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
great
fullbody
on
this
one
still
carbonation
level
is
spoton
the
flavors
turned
a
bit
harsh
with
this
one
i
thought
this
would
be
mellower
but
its
a
little
grating
moderatetohigh
bitterness
the
sweetness
is
absent
in
the
flavor
as
well
expected
more
a
toffee
flavor
but
instead
i
get
some
mild
citrus
leather
and
that
bitter
back
end
not
too
bad
but
i
enjoyed
this
more
with
just
1year
on
it
instead
of
3
ah
well
a
light
barley
wine
but
a
nice
beer
should
have
had
this
in
the
winter
time
what
got
me
with
this
one
is
that
qfc
had
sooo
many
of
them
and
they
were
so
cheap
3
50
ea
i
was
amazed
i
may
go
back
and
buy
a
lot
more
of
them
i
am
always
impressed
with
full
sail
brewing
and
they
keep
their
prices
where
they
should
be
thank
you
full
sail
d
the
intensity
of
the
earthiness
makes
this
a
bit
onedimensional
perhaps
but
i
like
it
not
for
everyone
but
i
cant
think
of
a
better
barleywine
in
22oz
bombers
for
3
50
drinkability
ive
found
fresh
bottles
to
be
coming
up
a
bit
short
on
the
malts
and
having
an
abrasive
hop
profile
so
i
was
rather
pleased
to
have
a
2002
bottle
cross
my
glass
while
never
bad
it
just
doesnt
shine
for
me
and
regardless
of
fresh
or
aged
it
seems
to
be
just
a
step
or
two
behind
the
rest
of
the
barleywine
pack
overall
i
would
drink
this
again
if
given
to
me
but
i
prob
wouldnt
spend
my
money
on
it
maybe
if
i
could
get
it
on
tap
somewhere
d
very
smooth
and
drinkable
for
9
scott
more
barleywine
always
a
good
thing
i
seek
them
out
wherever
i
go
this
one
is
a
2008
vintage
maybe
not
the
best
for
getting
the
fresh
hop
flavor
but
this
one
really
is
good
nice
clean
bitterness
a
malty
sweetness
almost
thick
i
really
like
this
one
the
guy
at
the
store
thought
it
was
a
less
favorable
example
but
i
disagree
and
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
barley
wine
but
maybe
not
newcomers
to
the
style
overall
the
feel
and
texture
of
this
beer
is
where
it
really
suffers
but
it
could
also
use
a
little
bit
more
complexity
in
the
taste
theres
so
many
great
barley
wines
out
there
id
pass
on
this
one
cant
beat
the
price
though
4
bucks
for
a
bomber
medium
bodied
smooth
and
malty
tasty
stuff
overall
goes
down
easy
and
is
holding
up
fine
after
4
years
this
is
a
good
candidate
for
the
cellar
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
between
the
bitterness
and
thinness
id
have
to
rank
its
drinkability
down
just
a
little
still
a
very
nice
beer
though
and
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
more
of
them
this
is
my
first
offering
from
full
sail
brewing
but
i
surely
hope
it
wont
be
the
last
my
hat
is
fully
tipped
to
full
sail
on
a
job
very
well
done
despite
finding
both
hops
and
malt
to
be
a
little
meek
and
alcohol
to
be
a
touch
immodest
at
times
id
still
consider
this
one
of
the
most
drinkable
barleywines
in
recent
memory
this
isnt
anything
that
need
be
saved
for
special
occasions
this
is
something
that
should
be
had
every
week
if
possible
dalthough
i
realize
that
american
barleywines
are
often
balanced
strongly
to
bitterness
this
one
seemed
just
a
bit
lacking
in
the
malt
department
this
made
the
beer
seem
at
times
tough
to
drink
rather
rough
around
the
edges
d
initially
impressed
by
this
beer
i
found
getting
through
the
whole
bomber
to
be
a
bit
of
a
chore
i
expected
more
from
a
classic
western
beer
fresh
zesty
fruity
deep
dark
and
delicious
wonderful
stuff
tasty
tasty
vibrant
fruit
high
hops
keep
on
ringing
in
yum
and
i
repeat
yum
a
rather
standard
unremarkable
american
barleywine
this
beer
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
it
has
terrific
balance
young
or
aged
the
hopping
is
subdued
but
there
is
plenty
of
boozy
essence
which
screams
barleywine
zero
oxidation
after
five
years
and
although
there
is
still
plenty
of
sweet
malt
it
is
not
too
chewy
or
overbearing
d
a
great
barleywine
for
an
even
better
price
definitly
getting
some
more
of
this
07
vintage
dark
cloudy
orange
with
a
compact
but
dense
beige
head
sweet
bready
malt
with
some
grains
and
a
subtle
candied
citrus
character
fig
and
raisin
too
flavor
is
much
the
same
i
imagine
that
this
is
a
very
hoppy
barleywine
fresh
but
with
a
year
its
nice
and
balanced
good
job
of
hiding
the
alcohol
mediumthick
body
overall
a
strong
malt
backbone
with
an
nice
aggressive
hops
followed
behind
the
mouth
feel
chewy
and
luscious
with
some
astringents
in
it
the
finish
is
bitter
and
leaves
an
impression
on
the
palate
i
didnt
know
i
was
going
to
expect
from
this
beer
but
i
am
pretty
impressed
i
will
cellar
another
one
of
these
beers
and
see
how
it
turns
out
in
a
couple
of
years
d
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
night
although
i
would
buy
it
again
if
for
no
other
reason
than
the
very
limited
selection
of
barleywines
at
the
store
goes
down
easy
enough
but
isnt
a
beer
that
continually
has
you
searching
the
bottom
of
your
glass
for
the
last
drop
j
d
i
let
this
set
out
on
the
counter
before
enjoying
and
this
helped
define
things
a
little
better
at
some
times
i
swear
i
am
drinking
a
heavy
apaipa
it
just
has
that
feel
another
thing
is
that
i
have
been
drinking
this
pretty
fast
and
still
no
alcohol
flavors
or
smells
even
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
none
existent
kudos
for
that
d
it
is
a
smooth

very
solid
and
enjoyable

i
prefer
a

more
sweetness
ok
overall
for
a
barleywine
this
might
be
better
aged
a
bit
more
worth
a
try
to
see
if
you
like
it
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
this
beer
there
didnt
seem
to
be
enough
malt
to
balance
out
the
hops
for
a
barleywine
it
just
wasnt
heavy
enough
pretty
decent
but
there
are
better
bws
out
there
well
recommended
pours
a
golden
ruby
color
with
a
sheet
of
off
white
head
smells
like
molasses
with
bits
of
spice
and
hops
still
taste
is
surprisingly
hoppy
for
being
over
2
years
old
nothing
else
really
sticks
out
mouthfeel
is
thinner
that
i
would
like
and
still
has
decent
carbonation
pours
murky
brown
with
red
highlights
and
a
short
offwhite
head
nice
lacing
musty
malty
aroma
with
wood
leather
and
caramel
more
caramel
malt
and
leather
in
the
taste
but
blended
nicely
with
the
hop
bitterness
the
alcohol
is
warm
but
masked
well
long
sweet
finish
a
great
barleywine
the
beers
pours
a
pale
cloudy
and
almost
awkward
brown
with
a
good
one
finger
of
off
white
head
nose
is
slightly
sour
almost
like
a
mild
soy
sauce
it
is
also
sweet
and
slight
acidic
smelling
taste
is
good
with
an
initial
sourness
breaking
through
followed
by
a
tart
finish
a
mellow
sweetness
almost
syrupy
in
nature
mellow
out
the
sour
and
tart
tones
theres
is
also
a
bitter
component
in
the
beer
making
in
actually
quite
complex
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
carbonation
is
fine
providing
a
body
that
well
supported
this
is
more
of
sipping
beer
than
a
gulper
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
off
white
2
finger
head
that
displays
some
staying
power
smells
of
citrus
hops
some
pine
and
grapefruit
sweet
caramel
malt
and
brown
sugar
hidden
deep
under
the
hops
taste
is
a
bit
maltier
than
the
nose
would
have
you
believe
im
hit
with
the
caramel
before
the
hops
come
in
with
the
grapefruit
and
the
lingering
hop
bitterness
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
as
well
mouthfeel
is
pricklycreamy
body
in
medium
to
thick
carbonation
is
moderate
decent
barley
wine
but
im
afraid
it
would
have
been
better
fresher
the
second
bottle
that
i
have
will
be
put
in
the
cellar
for
consumption
in
a
year
or
two
not
what
i
was
expecting
and
not
what
i
look
for
in
a
barleywine
but
not
too
shabby
d
im
probably
going
to
finish
this
bottle
without
even
thinking
about
it
which
is
probably
a
bad
thing
as
far
as
my
health
and
sobriety
are
concerned
ill
find
myself
wondering
where
all
that
brainpower
i
had
a
few
minutes
ago
went
and
realize
that
yes
i
really
did
drink
this
whole
thing
that
fast
the
drinkability
here
is
excellent
ive
had
previous
vintages
of
this
one
before
and
i
still
come
back
for
more
solid
brew
d
all
the
basic
barleywine
features
here
which
is
good
but
not
much
in
terms
of
uniqueness
so
it
could
be
a
benchmark
for
barleywines
this
beer
was
a
handful
with
a
22ounce
bottle
i
didnt
really
need
to
drink
anything
after
this
d
not
bad
a
real
tasty
treat
not
the
most
complex
or
even
flavourful
barley
wine
ive
ever
had
but
it
holds
its
own
and
strikes
me
as
a
great
intro
to
the
style
for
the
uninitiated
to
get
a
grasp
before
moving
on
to
further
samples
d
drinkability
is
good
and
even
higher
if
price
is
factored
in
a
pleasantly
strong
woody
and
malty
barleywine
with
some
subtle
caramel
sweetness
and
just
a
hint
of
fruit
definitely
heavy
on
the
malt
alcohol
and
the
9
abv
is
very
apparent
on
the
whole
definitely
worth
trying
and
id
imagine
saving
a
bottle
or
two
for
a
while
could
be
very
beneficial
the
aroma
was
caramel
sweetness
with
some
hoppiness
in
there
as
well
the
taste
was
malt
up
front
then
the
alcohol
hit
you
semi
spicy
with
a
fruit
peach
coming
to
the
taste
bud
in
the
mouth
it
was
full
and
finished
great
it
definitely
left
a
mark
on
the
tongue
due
to
the
high
abv
overall
was
super
complex
but
a
good
brew
none
the
less
luscious
mouthfeel
in
the
middle
of
a
taste
explosion
i
didnt
know
full
sail
had
it
in
em
yikes
this
is
good
their
amber
was
one
of
my
first
favorites
years
ago
since
joining
ba
i
wasnt
really
sure
if
they
could
hang
with
the
likes
of
rogue
deschutes
and
bridgeport
to
name
a
few
but
old
boardhead
delivered
ill
definitely
get
this
again
next
time
i
see
it
good
shit
pours
up
a

something
to
it

brew
a
winner
of
a
barleywine
i
got
1
more
in
tow
for
a
couple
years
not
sure
there
is
much
more
to
develop
but
if
kmore
abvmalt
comes
out
it
will
be
worth
it
d
a
decent

the
thin
side
dark
fruit
chocolate
caramel
dandelion
ends
bitter
and
dry
with
the
nice
hop
profiles
on
this
tasty
barleywine
i
suggest
drinking
it
young
to
enjoy
its
westcoast
flair
my
drinkability
score
often
reflects
price
at
3
50
a
bomber
this
is
about
as
cheap
of
a
barleywine
as
you
can
find
and
still
is
quite
tasty
try
one
if
you
get
the
chance
sip
it
cold
and
warm
see
what
you
think
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
a
bit
dry
with
an
alcohol
and
lingering
hop
burn
nice
d
thanks
to
johngalt1
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
this
is
still
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
but
i
very
much
enjoyed
it
note
2
i
always
score
moderately
on
high
abv
beers
for
drinkability
with
this
ale
full
sail
has
moved
its
way
back
up
to
where
they
belong
on
this
beer
advocates
top
ten
list
also
at
an
astonishing
price
of
3
29
the
price
point
couldnt
be
better
especially
with
the
rising
price
of
brewskies
ok
i
just
read
the
reviews
and
it
seems
that
this
batch
02
is
problematic
it
seems
that
some
of
the
lowest
scores
of
this
beer
come
from
this
batch
i
have
01
in
the
cellar
im
going
to
try
to
forget
this
one
and
when
that
is
accomplished
open
01
d
okay
it
is
a
barley
wine
that
looks
smells
tastes
and
hits
like
a
barley
wine
it
doesnt
wow
me
but
it
is
worth
a
taste
i
might
have
again
if
i
find
it
on
tap
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
thick
though
the
first
sip
brings
a
hoppy
burst
of
grass
pine
resin
but
the
maltiness
tastes
a
bit
hollow
a
bit
empty
after
the
beer
warms
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
begin
to
pull
through
as
do
some
mild
oak
flavors
alcohol
compliments
the
body
nicely
warming
the
back
of
the
throat
while
the
hops
leave
a
bitter
sticky
finish
body
is
wellcarbonated
and
a
bit
prickly
at
first
but
settles
down
within
fifteen
minutes
or
so
the
91
ibus
are
delivered
with
a
bang
as
expected
per
the
american
bw
style
but
a
better
malt
balance
wouldve
really
given
this
beer
a
stepup
in
complexity
perhaps
pushing
it
into
my
upper
echelon
of
brews
still
it
was
a
pretty
damn
good
barleywine
i
think
its
really
terrific
especially
when
its
warmed
and
the
brew
has
taken
a
coating
to
your
mouth
enjoy
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
makes
this
a
little
thin
one
of
the
smoothest
and
most
drinkable
barley
wines
around
d
eh
this
would
be
better
in
a
couple
years
this
might
be
the
first
full
sail
beer
that
i
truely
like
2007
reserve
poured
into
pint
glass
i
have
to
say
this
beer
look
amazing
thick
cream
head
really
thick
crystal
clear
amber
color
with
good
lacing
this
just
looks
like
a
good
beer
smell
is
brutal
with
hops
not
the
typical
barleywine
by
anymeans
taste
is
again
dominated
with
hops
if
i
were
going
blind
i
would
think
double
ipa
i
dont
notice
any
alcohol
at
all
i
guess
at
9
this
is
on
the
low
end
of
the
barleywine
abv
spectrum
but
still
very
well
hid
mouthfeel
is
medium
low
carbonation
leaves
a
somewhat
oilyhop
feeling
afterwards
overall
a
great
beer
from
full
sail
again
the
barleywine
label
seems
like
it
could
be
ipa
or
double
ipa
but
still
a
great
drink
im
going
to
pick
another
up
to
cellar
for
a
year
see
how
it
stands
up
to
next
years
and
how
the
aging
will
treat
it
id
also
like
to
try
this
one
on
tap
next
time
i
am
up
in
hood
river
good
job
full
sail
a
decent
barleywine
overall
balance
may
benefit
from
some
aging
of
the
hop
profile
for
me
the
sharpness
at
the
finish
and
notable
abv
detract
from
overall
drinkability
a
very
enjoyable
beer
well
worth
the
try

fruit
pretty
solid
american
barleywine
everything
there
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
pretty
excellent
for
the
style
nothing
crazy
but
definitely
nothing
wrong
very
nice
barleywine
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
barleywines
i
have
ever
tried
its
not
the
best
and
it
almost
reminds
me
more
of
a
double
ipa
still
worth
a
try
but
not
sure
if
age
is
going
to
do
much
for
this
one
this
just
doesnt
seem
to
have
enough
malts
to
back
up
the
hop
flavors
another
very
good
vintage
of
the
boardhead
and
i
need
to
pick
up
quite
a
few
more
for
the
cellar
i
think
it
will
only
get
better
as
the
hops
die
down
a
tad
and
allow
the
malts
to
show
through
but
it
is
still
very
nice
fresh
from
the
brewery
decent
but
somewhat
onedimensional
no
single
distinctive
character
hints
that
aging
would
be
worthwhile
id
guess
this
ones
better
fresh
in
the
mouth
its
amazing
im
blown
away
a
fantastic
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
with
plenty
of
both
mouth
almost
as
rich
as
an
english
bwine
but
so
so
many
hops
everywhere
they
must
be
citrus
hops
but
theyve
mellowed
enough
to
make
this
so
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
it
isnt
even
funny
hey
if
theres
a
beer
thats
me
today
and
that
hits
the
mark
right
on
the
fricking
dot
this
is
it
yeah
yeah
tastes
change
and
whatever
but
this
is
really
good
hmm
will
you
feel
badly
then
if
i
rate
my
westy
12
higher
of
course
not
its
a
different
style
well
in
the
style
of
barleywine
this
stuff
is
amazing
a
nicely
hopped
barelywine
thanks
again
john
d
a
fine
ale
w
bit
of
nw
hop
character
and
overall
light
in
feel
w
nice
malt
texture
and
flavor
a
well
crafted
barleywine
just
doesnt
stand
out
from
the
rest
imo
pours
a
dark
peachy
brown
haze
with
amber
tints
little
head
but
significant
for
a
bw
nose
indicates
that
it
is
a
very
american
style
west
coast
particularly
as
it
is
clearly
hop
dominant
the
taste
follows
with
citrus
and
pine
hop
flavors
there
is
a
clear
malt
presence
here
all
the
way
through
but
the
hop
flavors
do
dominate
if
you
like
old
ruffian
you
will
probably
like
this
there
are
some
sugary
backbones
but
mostly
a
hop
bitter
finish
a
good
offering
from
full
sail
i
am
excited
to
see
how
the
ones
in
my
cellar
do
in
5
or
so
good
brew
pours
a
haze
of
orange
in
the
body
and
a
yelloworangetan
head
with
pretty
nice
retention
it
seems
to
me
to
smell
an
awful
lot
like
cohoho
a
touch
more
malty
and
a
major
hop
presence
the
taste
is
dry
and
citrus
all
the
way
through
and
a
pale
floral
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
grows
more
so
as
it
goes
on
the
yeast
makes
it
a
midslow
drinker
overall
not
a
bad
choice
try
her
out
if
your
into
ipaish
american
barleywines
or
even
if
like
me
you
prefer
a
more
malty
selection
its
pretty
good
d
this
is
an
awesome
american
barleywine
imho
one
of
full
sails
best
beers
and
very
drinkable
at
that
highly
recommended
i
would
call
this
beer
more
of
a
dipa
than
a
bw
minus
the
syrupy
feel
nevertheless
it
is
my
favorite
full
sail
beer
yet
and
it
went
down
very
smoothly
recommended
if
you
can
track
one
down
especially
for
the
inexpensive
price
tag
it
carries
i
think
a
year
was
a
perfect
amount
of
time
to
wait
and
drink
this
one
this
is
definitely
a
tasty
barleywine
it
is
still
surprisingly
hoppy
but
i
could
see
it
actually
getting
a
bit
better
for
my
taste
with
a
couple
more
years
of
age
on
it
at
times
the
hops
can
be
a
bit
harsh
and
aggressive
here
and
i
would
like
to
see
a
touch
more
malt
character
still
this
is
quite
a
tasty
tipple
and
is
definitely
hitting
the
spot
on
this
cool
december
evening
d
very
hoppy
and
very
sweet
i
am
thinking
this
one
needs
more
time
to
mellow
id
like
to
taste
this
beer
with
a
bigger
malt
bill
d
a
nice
solid
barley
wine
with
unexpected
features
that
made
it
interesting
to
drink
i
enjoyed
the
experience
but
doubt
ill
be
back
unless
someone
brings
it
to
the
table
this
is
the
reserve
07
batch
pours
a
nice
thick
amber
head
that
slowy
dissipates
nice
lace
though
and
creamy
mouthfeel
the
hops
are
prominent
but
the
alcohol
is
dominate
almost
tart
and
very
nice
sweet
aftertaste
a
great
seasonal
christmasy
beer
as
it
warmed
up
all
the
flavours
became
more
intense
but
i
still
find
it
very
drinkable
very
nice
bwsa
and
one
id
drink
again
with
no
qualms
a
year
or
2
of
aging
i
think
bobs
your
uncle
you
have
a
winner
refreshing
from
a
22
oz
bottle
marked
2006
vintage
this
poured
a
clear
redorange
with
a
light
redorange
head
and
lots
of
lacing
nose
is
sweet
with
caramel
fruit
and
faint
hops
mouthfeel
very
solid
almost
chewy
flavors
are
similar
to
the
nose
with
fruits
dominating
apricot
is
the
most
apparent
but
berries
seem
to
be
there
as
well
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
and
i
have
two
more
bottles
to
age
and
try
again
later
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
super
easy
to
drink
even
at
its
abv
level
good
flavor
profile
and
aroma
nice
body
and
smooth
alcohol
d
very
tasty
goes
down
as
easily
as
any
beer
that
is
as
intense
as
this
one
is
not
very
filling
excellent
representation
of
style
even
thought
there
are
several
beers
with
a
higher
abv
this
is
a
good
beer
to
relax
with
when
you
want
a
good
swift
kick
in
the
pants
due
to
the
intensity
of
flavor
along
with
the
9
00
abv
i
wasnt
sure
what
quite
sue
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
despite
the
compliments
paid
to
it
by
wasatch
but
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
smells
hoppy
tastes
hoppy
soapy
tealike
needs
more
time
d
i
think
its
good
but
i
also
feel
like
its
missing
its
umph
the
flavor
is
there
just
feels
like
its
lacking
some
kind
of
punch
to
it
still
a
good
beer
and
might
buy
it
again
especially
from
the
cost
poured

this

no

is
present
in
the
flavor
just
rich
dark

and
piney

there
is
also
a
hint
of
licorice
extremely
drinkable
for
a
barley
wine
old
boardhead
is
a
solid
barleywine
enjoyable
but
there
are
in
my
opinion
much
better
barleywines
out
there
i
have
another
bottle
in
the
cellar
well
see
what
a
couple
years
will
do
for
it
mouthfeel
is
more
on
the
thin
side
has
a
nice
alcohol
warmth
pretty
tasty
what
a
neat
beer
this
one
is
one
of
the
few
barleywines
that
ive
had
where
you
feel
like
they
started
with
an
english
barleywine
and
hopped
it
up
in
a
complementary
manner
to
an
american
barleywine
rich
dark
red
in
color
an
off
white
head
that
lasts
way
longer
than
i
would
expect
sweet
dark
ripe
fruit
toffee
malts
balance
out
a
citrus
citric
floral
hop
boquet
the
taste
is
rich
complimentary
and
wonderfull
the
only
place
this
one
fell
short
in
my
opinion
was
mouthfeel
given
that
english
character
i
wouldve
liked
it
to
be
a
fuller
body
other
than
that
and
besides
that
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
what
a
nice
treat
via
trade
thanks
wasatch
not
very
drinkable
this
one
really
took
a
while
the
harsh
taste
well
overshadowed
any
positives
i
just
didnt
care
for
it
the
body
is
dry
and
accents
the
limited
complexity
flavor
carbonation
feel
is
a
little
light
but
ok
i
guess
im
pretty
hard
on
barelywines
but
i
could
see
improvement
on
this
maybe
i
aged
this
too
long
or
not
long
enough
bottle
courtesy
of
cba
poured
a
deep
orangey
color
ale
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
average
retention
but
great
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
is
balance
with
some
citrusy
hops
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
sweet
malt
that
are
somewhat
lacking
in
dry
fruits
characteristics
and
some
citrusy
west
coast
hops
i
usually
prefer
barley
wine
to
be
more
of
the
english
style
and
less
dominated
by
hops
and
more
dry
figs
characteristics
would
have
been
preferable
body
was
quite
full
with
some
great
carbonation
and
no
alcohol
was
discernable
overall
a
nice
american
barley
wine
its
very
in
your
face
but
not
too
much
to
not
be
enjoyable
poured
a
very
hazy
dark
burnt
ruby
amber
very
intresting
hue
as
the
reddish
tint
was
very
noticeable
even
though
the
haze
made
it
almost
opaque
a
one
inch
head
formed
on
the
top
upon
pour
that
faded
almost
immediatly
what
was
left
was
a
thin
film
of
decent
quality
lace
that
circle
around
the
glass
smell
was
very
sweet
caramel
sugars
hitting
almost
immediatly
the
deeper
smell
after
some
warming
indicated
a
nice
bready
earthy
malt
back
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
which
at
9abv
and
being
a
barleywine
should
be
expected
the
taste
for
me
was
just
too
light
i
expect
barleywines
to
make
me
sit
down
and
to
be
a
definite
sipper
but
this
just
did
not
have
the
fullness
i
would
have
expected
the
finish
on
it
was
very
dry
and
did
last
a
good
bit
though
the
taste
itself
was
very
hoppy
with
piney
flavors
the
most
noticeable
a
slight
malt
back
was
trying
to
form
with
flavors
of
grain
and
bread
but
was
just
too
thin
to
really
be
noticed
there
was
a
huge
amount
of
carbonation
again
for
a
barleywine
on
this
one
lots
of
fizz
and
contributed
to
the
feeling
of
lightness
overall
this
gave
me
more
of
an
impression
of
a
well
balanced
double
ipa
may
improve
and
bring
out
some
flavors
as
it
sits
but
a
little
younf
still
for
me
mouthfeel
is
average
again
just
barely
missing
if
not
for
that
midpalate
this
is
still
a
very
good
bw
id
really
like
to
come
accross
a
few
more
bottles
too
sample
this
fresh
and
with
more
age
on
it
the
hops
wont
knock
you
out
but
an
easydrinking
9
bomber
just
might
overall
impression
i
liked
this
beer
i
didnt
think
that
i
would
it
sure
seems
to
get
better
as
you
go
at
9
i
guess
that
could
be
excepted
i
would
drink
this
again
i
have
another
bottle
i
will
set
aside
for
a
couple
of
years
ill
get
back
with
you
for
the
brew

now
looking
forward
to
a
2005
version
to
check
how
this
one
ages
this
is
a
fine
barleywine
its
more
balanced
and
approachable
than
others
of
the
style
not
the
most
extreme
not
that
thats
a
bad
thing
i
imagine
that
by
aging
it
for
a
year
full
sail
has
allowed
it
to
mellow
nice
very
impressed
with
this
brew
from
full
sail
will
need
to
find
again
drinkabilitynotes

this
was
a
hard
one
to
drink
just
a
bit
too
hot
and
uninteresting
for
my
taste
in
barleywines
it
really
just
tastes
like
a
big
hoppy
amber
ale
without
the
added
flavors
that
normally
accompany
a
big
american
barleywine
finished
pretty
harshly
when
it
warmed
up
becoming
pretty
tannic
id
ask
for
quite
a
bit
less
bitterness
in
this
brew
it
seems
out
of
balance
taste
the
fruits
are
more
defined
in
the
flavor
than
they
were
in
the
nose
theres
a
little
bit
of
apricots
oranges
and
some
hints
of
apricots
the
malts
come
through
nicely
in
the
middle
with
caramel
and
toffee
but
this
has
a
very
strong
alcohol
bite
that
really
detracts
from
the
flavor
of
the
beer
for
me
maybe
if
i
had
given
this
some
more
time
to
allow
the
alcohol
to
integrate
itself
more
i
would
have
have
enjoyed
this
much
more
i
could
see
that
this
had
potential
it
just
didnt
suite
me
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
and
with
such
a
big
alcohol
presence
im
having
a
hard
time
drinking
this
one
05
vintage
pours
dark
copper
to
amber
in
color
and
clear
with
a
small
cream
head
that
fades
back
quickly
aroma
is
of
sweet
malty
sugars
raisins
and
apricots
aslo
a
hint
of
booziness
in
the
aroma
alcohol
comes
thru
much
bigger
in
the
taste
than
aroma
it
is
preceded
by
a
fairly
fleeting
rich
and
smooth
caramel
sweetness
alcohol
ponces
on
the
palate
next
and
is
pretty
large
but
not
offensive
there
is
also
a
toasted
coconut
thing
here
drinkability
is
not
bad
but
22
oz
definitely
makes
me
a
little
cloudy
great
to
finally
try
this
beer
i
wish
that
i
had
cracked
old
boardheads
crown
several
years
ago
because
i
have
a
feeling
that
its
a
much
better
beer
when
fresh
to
its
credit
though
its
still
mighty
drinkable
as
long
as
your
tolerance
for
tart
fruit
and
citrus
zest
is
on
the
high
side
if
youre
cellaring
the
03
my
advice
is
to
drink
it
last
year
between
the
abv
and
the
sweetsour
alternation
this
beer
is
not
the
easiest
to
drink
took
me
two
hours
to
finish
a
22oz
bottle
thanks
oxymoron
for
the
opportunity
pours
a
two
finger

leaving
some

is
very
thick
and
pleasurable
i
would
willingly
drink
a
lot
of
this
very
well
done
overall
a
bit
below
what
i
was
expecting
but
them
maybe
i
was
expecting
too
much
hey
i
recommend
it
i
was
just
hoping
for
something
a
bit
more
exciting
pours
a
pretty

nice
aroma
of
spicy
floral

blended
with
partly
roasted

a
hint

fleeting
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
very
light

body
is
a
bit
sticky
and
syrupy
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
the
high
alcohol
content
of
course
to
be
expected
in
a
barleywine
is
blended
rather
well
into
the
overall
character
of
the
beer
while
not
exactly
the
easiest
drinking
beer
around
this
one
is
quite
enjoyable
and
is
an
experience
worth
repeating
d
smells
was
awesome
taste
was
too
much
for
me
i
didnt
find
it
as
easy
drinking
as
some
people
did
on
here
not
bad
though
pours

a
very
good
barleywine
full
sail
should
be
proud
this
was
the
2004
edition
perhaps
that
accounts
for
the
more
mellow
hop
profile
than
other
american
barleywines
i
have
tried
pours
goldencopper
in
color
and
surprisingly
clear
the
nose
provides
that
familiar
anitquated
smell
along
with
a
healthy
dose
of
hops
initially
on
the
palate
there
is
a
rush
of
semisweet
elements
followed
in
turn
by
the
firm
structure
of
a
reliable
bw
bitterness
that
lasts
through
to
the
aftertaste
in
the
mouth
this
brew
is
somewhat
spritzy
and
expectedly
bitter
but
it
drinks
fairly
easily
even
for
a
bw
heres
a
beer
i
cant
say
no
to
color
is
a
copperinfused

here
lasted
forever

just
a
faint
note
of

very

lots
of

burn
too
much
the
hops
are
able
to
poke
through
moreso
than
in
the
aroma
but
dont
do
much
to
stop
the
avalanche
of
sweetness
bottle

91
ibu
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
sits
on
the
palate
nicely
and
sticks
to
the
ribs
not
as
drinkable
due
to
the
fiery
burn
in
the
belly
i
wonder
what
older
versions
taste
like
after
some
additional
aging
initial
white
sugar
flavour
fades
and
then
comes
back
with
pleasant
alcohol
induced
warmth
then
the
hops
kick
in
and
i
am
reminded
of
kendal
mint
cake
this
is
kendal
mint
cake
for
grownups
though
pretty
much
the
same
except
not
as
much
caramel
goodness
also
seemed
a
tad
stale
maybe
its
just
not
ripe
yet
would
drop
my
score
down
if
this
is
the
first
sample
i
had
to
go
off
probably
to
a
mid
3s
a
year
later
had
the
2005
edition
and
it
wasnt
as
enjoyable
bitter
quite
easy
to
drink
the
abv
really
sneaks
up
on
you
drinkability
very
well
done
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
had
no
alcohol
presence
noted
and
immensely
balanced
strongly
recommended
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
outstanding
could
be
a
little
more
robust

but
one

is
plenty
for
me
as
it
sneaks
up
on
ya
overall
a
very
drinkable
barley
wine
but
not
one
i
would
savour
drinkability

this
ale
will
go
with
just
about
any
big
dish
but
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
it
on
its
own
its
extremely
well
balanced
not
a
heavyhanded
pacnw
abw
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
that
heavyhitter
that
proves
itself
to
be
the
real
deal
year
after
year
the
beer
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
and
warm
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
roasted
malts
along
with
a
mild
hop
aroma
it
has
a
raisin
scent
very
nice
the
taste
is
great
it
has
an
intensely
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
smooth
and
slow
and
finishes
warm
dry
and
bitter
it
has
a
toastey
feel
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
barleywine
it
has
good
flavor
and
aroma
its
not
in
the
upper
tier
of
brews
but
it
drinks
well
nonetheless
body
is
medium
to
large
with
tiny
pinpoint
carbonation
and
a
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
for
such
a
new
vintage
only
7
months
old
i
would
scoop
this
up
by
the
case
if
i
lived
where
its
available
apperently
usually
under
4
bucks
a
pop
great
value
pleasantly
sweet
and
sour
but
strangely
so
rich
in
bittering
hops
that
come
off
like
bitter
greens
frisee
and
pine
sap
soap
theres
nutty
biscuit
and
orange
blossom
honey
almost
like
eucalyptus
rub
your
tongue
with
wild
bergamot
then
dip
it
in
warm
honey
sounds
better
then
it
is
perhaps
it
needs
some
age
but
im
wary
liked
this
beer
found
it
drinkable
for
the
style
maybe
could
use
some
cellar
time
tawny
dark
gold
with
the
small
head
the
nose
is
tempered
with
age
and
old
hops
full
mouth
with
a
very
nice
smoothness
this
is
a
classic
pnw
barley
wine
that
ages
well
and
drink
even
better
it
also
loves
a
good
cheese
try
also
with
a
cigar
i
want
more
bottles
to
put
down
the
flavor
is
substantially
sweet
with
some
noticable
alcoholic
heat
theres
some
weird
fruit
elements
going
on
green
rasin
this
beer
is
aging
well
the
flavors
are
well
incorporated
an
and
all
hopping
subdued
but
the
alcoholic
heat
could
go
down
a
little
more
thanks
to
reddiamond
for
recommending
this
one
wish
id
bought
more
my
bomber
of
2003
boardhead
poured
into
my
glass
a
deep
roasted
peach
color
with
a
very
slight
chill
haze
evident
there
is
a
delicate
but
slightly
viscous
head
capping
this
barleywine
settling
down
into
a
wispy
foam
remainder
aroma
brings
a
mouthwatering
vintage
barleywine
funkiness
impressive
for
a
2003
ale
funky
musty
rotting
fruit
rising
bread
yeastiness
and
a
hint
of
spice
and
alcoholic
zip
taste
does
have
a
definite
alcohol
presence
serving
as
the
base
in
this
barleywine
stew
of
flavors
thats
mature
beyond
its
years
a
complex
mix
of
malts
dances
or
perhaps
stumbles
gracefully
along
with
figs
dates
smashed
brown
apples
and
brandied
apricot
slight
hop
bitterness
builds
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
toward
the
finish
very
smooth
well
rounded
barleywine
an
excellent
example
of
vintage
flavor
remarkably
achieved
in
a
relatively
young
beer
old
boardhead
is
not
bottle
conditioned
but
improves
appreciably
with
aging
its
also
worth
noting
that
at
3
99
for
a
22
oz
bomber
this
robust
barleywine
makes
for
an
exceptional
value
be
sure
to
drink
it
at
near
room
temperature
i
really
really
like
this
drinkability
is
very
high
really
tasty
juicy
with
right
amount
of
bittering
to
offset
the
heavy
sweet
malts
present
given
some
time
this
brew
just
may
turn
out
to
be
amazing
and
at
3
49
for
a
bomber
i
couldnt
help
but
get
a
couple
extra
to
hold
on
to
pours
a
clear
deep
orange
body
no
head
and
no
carbonation
smells
of
orange
peel
toasted
bread
and
light
peanut
butter
alcohol
is
doninant
flavor
along
with
a
tart
finish
in
the
middle
is
a
decent
amount
of
roasted
malt
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
are
average
what
i
have
is
an
awful
barleywine
and
i
would
guess
its
infected
as
full
sail
usually
does
a
good
job
on
their
brews
especially
the
reserves
like
this
one
unfortunately
this
one
has
to
go
down
the
sink
today
ill
rate
it
as
i
taste
it
and
i
probably
wont
bother
rerating
it
in
the
future
we
did
a
vertical
tasting
with
a
bottle
from
2002
the
02
was
good
but
this
was
the
overwhelming
favorite
phenomenal
melded
flavor
seriously
this
tastes
incredible
the
hops
and
malt
coninside
so
unbelievably
well
sticky
malty
bliss
with
notes
of
apples
plums
and
caramel
along
with
hops
that
provide
notes
of
pine
and
marijuana
this
was
a
22oz
bomber
from
03
it
appeared
to
have
a
deep
reddish
amber
body
when
poured
with
a
surprisingly
tall
off
white
head
fairly
good
clarity
to
the
body
and
the
head
fell
rather
quickly
leaving
no
lace
as
it
disappeared
the
aroma
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
rose
out
of
the
glass
with
notes
of
fruits
in
the
background
decent
amount
of
hops
in
the
nose
as
well
and
a
touch
on
alcohol
as
it
warms
the
flavor
stare
with
a
caramel
fruity
sweetness
with
notes
of
a
syrupy
molasses
type
flavor
the
after
taste
is
a
bit
bitter
with
a
small
alcohol
bite
as
it
goes
down
the
body
here
is
full
and
thick
with
a
nice
mouth
coating
quality
to
it
this
went
down
fairly
easy
and
even
as
it
warmed
the
alcohol
never
became
the
most
prominent
feature
of
the
beer
too
bad
i
cant
get
these
around
here
because
this
is
one
good
barley
wine
2003
bottle
copper
to
orange
body
with
a
diminishing
but
foamy
and
welllaced
offwhite
head
complex
aroma
with
peaty
nuances
and
a
deeply
integrated
fruity
profile
oranges
peaches
caramel
sweetness
abund
while
light
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
as
powerful
as
this
is
it
still
appears
very
balanced
in
mouth
theres
more
of
this
caramel
goodness
going
on
although
theres
more
hops
than
i
expected
not
old
horizontal
hoppy
but
its
west
coast
all
right
chewy
palate
with
peaches
nuances
pears
citrus
and
a
very
mild
tartness
approaching
apples
which
doesnt
quite
manage
to
give
a
decent
fight
to
the
overwhelming
and
coating
sweetness
its
not
cloying
but
feels
very
rich
peaty
earthy
decadent
full
body
with
rather
high
carbonation
to
style
and
plain
rich
this
is
perhaps
not
as
big
as
i
expected
it
to
be
but
taken
on
parallel
with
quite
a
few
other
peers
it
definitely
strikes
as
a
great
example
of
how
to
balance
raw
power
still
i
think
forgetting
it
a
few
years
would
help
to
blend
the
different
elements
together
even
better
huge
thanks
to
skyhand
for
this
top
malty
example
nice
looking
scarlet
red
appearance
thin
but
dense
coating
of
bone
white
head
this
recedes
to
a
rather
thick
collaring
with
good
staying
and
lacing
power
alcohol
soaked
melons
and
passion
fruit
on
the
nose
sweet
drippings
of
caramel
and
perfumey
hops
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
and
perfumey
and
minty
its
not
bad
but
this
characteristic
holds
it
back
from
being
a
great
barleywine
in
my
mind
passion
fruits
strawberries
and
mango
find
time
to
make
appearances
alcohol
lays
low
in
the
background
this
is
o
k
but
i
liked
the
2002
version
a
lot
better
quite
simply
this
barleywine
rocks
at
first
i
thought
it
was
like
a
beefed
up
english
style
barleywine
ala
old
ho
fresh
of
course
aged
old
ho
is
boring
nice
malty
sweetness
up
front
more
of
a
earthy
hoppiness
going
on
but
as
it
warms
its
pnw
roots
couldnt
help
but
shine
a
rumsoaked
raisiny
alcohol
warmth
started
to
develop
it
became
more
piney
and
resinous
in
its
hoppy
nature
in
fact
its
bitterness
becomes
quite
agressive
creamy
and
chewy
mouthfeel
it
really
has
a
little
of
everything
but
in
a
harmonious
way
it
doesnt
hide
its
9
alcohol
too
well
nor
its
91
ibus
but
i
like
booze
and
hops
so
who
cares
its
almost
gone
and
im
bummed
22oz
bomber
reserve
03
poured
a
nice
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
is
melting
away
quickly
nice
array
of
hops
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
strong
sweet
doughy
malt
aroma
with
notes
of
vanilla
and
toffy
an
aroma
to
die
for
one
that
allows
equal
appreciation
of
malt
and
hops
incredibly
smooth
body
that
is
full
and
with
a
low
carbonation
slightly
syrupy
and
sweet
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
with
lots
of
caramel
and
toffy
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
is
the
best
barley
wine
ive
had
in
years
this
was
a
bit
cheesey
almost
a
little
ass
its
perhaps
a
something
a
little
wrong
with
it
but
its
not
so
far
off
the
norm
that
im
really
worried
about
it
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
though
its
malty
and
a
bit
alcoholic
this
was
the
02
version
and
ill
be
trying
the
01
version
pretty
soon
this
was
a
decent
barleywine
but
not
one
of
the
best
i
think
the
hops
may
have
mellowed
so
much
that
the
beer
lost
some
of
its
balance
id
like
to
try
a
more
recent
vintage
drinkability
judging
by
the
short
lifespan
of
this
bomber
id
say
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
is
pretty
good
of
course
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
an
evening
nor
would
i
want
to
this
is
a
well
balanced
barley
wine
that
would
make
a
great
fireside
companion
come
winter
deep
brown
color
medium

malts
apples

dates
big
bold
barleywine
this
puppy
reaches
up
and
grab
you
by
the
malty
and
hoppy
the
malt
sweetness
is
balanced
by
it
big
hoppyness
then
the
alcohol
bite
grabs
you
the
fact
that
all
three
are
balanced
and
rotate
around
on
your
taste
buds
is
amazing
complex
flavors
and
very
warming
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
smooth
and
a
little
dry
aftertaste
is
malty
and
slightly
bitter
with
a
lingering
sweetness
bottle
aging
will
improve
this
already
excellent
beer
thanks
to
weefisheads
for
the
22ozer
this
was
kind
of
a
disappointing
for
me
bacuase
i
have
always
liked
full
sail
beers
there
wasnt
much
to
the
flavor
and
what
was
there
wasnt
wonderful
none
of
that
huge
maltiness
and
hops
kick
that
i
have
some
to
expect
from
brews
such
as
this

on
the
bottom
of
the
list

me

not
bad
at
all
a
nice
copper
amber
color
very
little
head
or
at
least
little
head
retention
very
fragarent
with
the
smell
of
hops
and
spices
this
beer
has
a
good
first
taste
with
a
blast
of
spices
which
quickly
dies
into
a
bitter
taste
this
taste
slowly
melts
away
into
quite
an
aggressive
aftertaste
thats
a
little
harsh
at
first
but
goes
away
as
the
palate
warms
up
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
with
quite
a
punch
now
the
gushy
emotional
crap
wow
this
is
very
very
very
good
its
definitely
not
too
sweet
im
hypersensitive
to
sweet
but
not
as
hugely
hoppy
as
some
of
the
west
coast
bws
very
well
balanced
this
is
a
delicious
beer
thats
a
pleasure
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
creamy
creamy

somewhat
murky

appearance
spicy
and
hoppy

some
sense
of
ginger
snap
to
the
malty
part
of
the

nice
wow
another
combat
scenario
between
hops
and
malt
and
its
close
to
an
all
out
offensive
ginger
and
cinnamon
augment
a
raw
cocoa
impression
but
are
immediately
countered
by
a
sting
of
oily
resiny
hop
low
carbonation
lets
this
counterpunching
complexity
have
full
reign
finishes
with
just
a
touch
of
a
coating
diacetyl
and
with

hiccup

here
a
cheek
twister
thanks
to
jaybeerman
for
the
chance
to
taste
this
one
i
like
when
it
poured
a
light
golden
brown
with
little
to
no
foam
and
very
little
lace
the
smell
was
of
a
malty
citrus
hoppy
aroma
that
was
pleasant
in
the
nose
the
taste
at
first
was
had
a
sweet
malty
caramel
flavor
with
a
stong
hoppy
finish
but
after
a
few
sips
it
tasted
just
like
another
strong
ale
like
so
many
others
there
was
nothing
outstanding
that
made
this
beer
standout
among
any
others
still
worth
trying
if
you
like
barleywine
ales
drinkability
notes
a
godly
brew
beers
like
this
make
me
weep
first
of
all
i
cant
get
it
on
a
regular
basis
and
may
never
have
this
beer
again
secondly
i
am
so
sad
about
the
first
i
cant
remember
this
barleywine
rocks
oh
yeah
it
went
great
with
some
bbq
chicken
pasta
topped
with
fresh
feta
a
translucent
deep
copper
to
almost
brown
color
on
the
pour
the
head
is
or
was
frothy
and
modest
in
size
but
it
has
evaporated
to
some
pretty
interesting
lace
aromas
of
baked
apples
malt
fusel
alcohol
bubble
gum
tones
caramel
whew
what
a
treat
for
the
old
schnozzle
thickly
sweet
and
lots
of
malt
at
the
start
the
top
middling
and
the
alcohol
starts
warming
the
minute
it
leaves
the
mouth
and
heads
for
the
tummy
peacefully
acidic
with
the
hops
warlike
in
their
spicy
bite
quite
dry
and
a
nice
lingering
alcohol
bitterness
one
of
the
top
5
barley
wines
of
all
time
in
my
book
at
least
wow
a
hearty
cheer
to
captain
jreitman
for
allowing
me
to
sail
aboard
old
boardhead
2001
vintage
brown
in
color
with
reddishorange
highlights
topped
by
a
thick
foamy
light
tan
head
that
drops
but
holds
a
good
116
covering
and
leaves
some
limited
lace
a
medium
body
combines
with
a
light
carbonation
to
give
a
lightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
a
bold
fruity
flavor
combines
summer
fruits
melons
berries
and
a
light
amount
of
dark
fruits
with
a
super
malty
sweetness
of
caramel
malts
and
honey
alongside
sappy
resiny
hop
flavors
backed
by
a
stiff
bitterness
extremely
well
balanced
with
alternating
emphasis
being
given
to
the
sweet
fruitiness
or
the
dark
sticky
pinelike
hoppiness
good
complexity
finishes
nicely
with
a
combination
of
the
main
flavors
and
a
light
licorice
note
but
without
ever
becoming
cloying
the
listed
alcohol
of
10
6
is
superbly
masked
giving
just
a
notquitesherry
character
a
rich
complex
smooth
and
remarkably
drinkable
barleywine
distinct
from
any
other
with
its
unique
hop
character
2001
vintage
the
color
is
amber
and
a
bit
lighter
than
most
barleywines
its
got
a
fairly
light
hop
aroma
and
a
somewhat
thin
head
the
taste
is
also
on
the
light
side
for
a
barleywine
despite
the
abv
however
it
does
have
a
nice
malt
backbone
with
residual
sweetness
and
just
a
hint
of
fruit
not
bad
but
nothing
extraordinary
thanks
to
jaybeerman
for
the
sample
o
a
nice
barleywine
i
will
try
to
grab
some
more
when
i
see
them
strong
yet
smooth
very
unique
taste
sweet
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
best
barley
wines
i
have
tasted
in
a
while
me
and
my
friend
always
ask
for
it
when
we
go
to
a
store
together
plus
my
buddy
loves
the
high
abv
barley
wines
so
this
one
does
the
trick
at
15
very
tasty
not
too
malty
as
some
barley
wines
tend
to
be
this
is
the
2013
version
cant
find
a
bottle
date
but
about
a
year
and
a
half
of
age
to
it
the
smell
is
incredible
can
hardly
taste
the
15
percent
alcohol
but
it
hits
you
pretty
fast
and
hard
the
aging
has
done
wonders
to
this
beer
definitely
a
sipper
cheers
ben
unique
sweet

some

great
stuff

super

very

with

its
flavors

in

after

i
can

taste
that
15
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
definitely
one
that
would
improve
with
age
unfortunately
i
was
only
able
to
track
down
one
bottle
glass
snifter
on
tap
at
fairfax
alehouse
poured
into
snifter
copper
body
with
thin
bone
head
that
quickly
collapses
to
nothing

note
on
the

full
body
thick

light

boozy
finish
it
is
a
very
high
alcohol
beer
but
it
does
not
have
the
high
alcohol
taste
that
so
many
do
i
really
enjoyed
it
f
medium
body
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
be
fair
this
beer
was
a
beast
and
one
bottle
would
be
enough
for
a
sitting
even
though
i
could
have
easily
cracked
open
another
it
did
not
feel
like
15
abv
but
there
was
enough
here
to
bowl
me
over
in
more
than
one
way
possibly
the
best
offering
outside
of
the
120
for
dogfish
and
grand
enough
to
turn
me
on
to
the
style
if
youve
never
had
something
of
this
sort
before
this
would
be
an
excellent
choice
to
start
with
quite
lovely
from
start
to
finish
very
leggy
and
the
figdateraisiny
qualities
really
make
this
one
shine
15
is
unbelievable
dfh
nailed
the
balance
on
this
barely
wine
high
octane
and
complex
with
rich
flavors
thinking
of
how
this
one
would
age
would
like
to
age
a
bottle
and
revisit
it
tastes
strong
and
delicious
o
strong
barleywines
are
fairly
new
to
me
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
would
like
to
have
again
like
to
age
it
and
see
what
flavors
come
out
when
the
alcohol
dies
down
best
barleywine
have
twoaging
for
better
tatse
pours
a
rich
hazy
amber
certainly
smells
of
figs
and
dates
tastes
like
it
too
a
little
more
than
youd
expect
from
a
barleywine
not
my
favorite
but
very
good
nonetheless
at
over
15
its
quite
enjoyable
although
it
may
not
be
for
everyone
this
one
doesnt
hide
its
alcohol
needs
cellaring
i
had
this
fresh
but
you
can
tell
it
will
be
great
with
a
few
years
on
it
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
will
definitely
probably
get
again
some
time
in
the
future
the
only
downside
is
its
fairly
pricey17
for
a
4pack
overall
this
is
an
incredibly
strong
and
complex
beer
it
really
reminds
me
of
dfh
raison
dextra
except
with
less
offense
and
aggressive
flavors
i
really
want
to
take
the
advice
of
the
label
and
bury
this
in
my
yard
for
2
years
but
i
guess
my
cellar
works
fine
as
well
overall
a
fantastic
barelywine
overall
a
good
barleywine
and
the
addition
of
figs
and
dates
is
a
nice
touch
would
love
to
see
how
it
ages
but
for
now
its
a
nice
one
to
sip
on
a
winter
evening
the
first
taste
is
first
alcohol
heavy
with
a
gentle
warming
of
my
mouth
and
throat
upon
swallowing
the
feel
is
heavy
and
slightly
syrupy
after
the
alcohol
there
is
a
presence
of
richer
fruits
like
raisin
and
fig
some
apple
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
i
like
it
though
and
have
put
some
bottles
in
the
cellar
to
rest
cheers
overall
this
beer
is
very
hot
right
now
but
still
very
enjoyable
alcohol
almost
creates
a
sourness
in
the
fruit
flavors
but
the
underlying
malts
and
fruits
blend
perfectly
together
sugary
sweet
and
syrupy
with
lovely
apples
figs
dates
raisins
fermenting
in
it
all
an
obvious
sipper
but
lovely
currently
mine
is
cellaring
and
my
review
reflects
the
2013
version
consumed
fresh
gonna
have
to
let
this
age
and
retry
to
see
if
it
mellows
out
a
bit
i
almost
feel
like
this
beer
was
a
big
young
i
will
try
this
again
next
time
fr
a
bottle
with
a
date
this
is
a
good
beer
too
much
booze
figs
and
dates
are
cool
tho
i
like
dfh
i
like
barley
wines
and
i
like
big
beers
so
this
should
have
been
a
slam
dunk
but
this
was
a
miss
for
me
nose
is
pure
booze
up
front
the
taste
is
all
booze
i
think
there
were
some
yummy
flavors
in
there
somewhere
but
totally
overpowered
i
bought
4
and
drank
1
so
ill
see
how
the
others
do
in
the
cellar
for
a
couple
of
years
o
as
with
all
of
dfhs
caution
cap
series
this
is
just
a
crazy
strong
blownup
take
on
the
style
not
the
best
barleywine
on
the
market
but
its
an
absolute
blast
to
drink
at
15
it
is
not
for
the
weak
but
if
you
like
a
brew
that
challenges
you
this
is
totally
worth
a
shot
i
wanted
to
try
one
fresh
but
maybe
i
shouldnt
have
tried
it
quite
this
fresh
its
very
hot
dates
and
figs
are
washed
out
from
the
alcohol
i
wont
touch
the
remaining
bottles
for
at
least
1
year
i
hope
it
cleans
up
with
age
prost
having
fresh
super
hot
needs
at
least
a
year
or
2
o
ill
be
honest
never
drank
a
15
before
but
the
initial
smell
and
some
of
the
notes
were
off
to
me
have
to
assume
this
is
new
but
i
have
no
idea
will
try
it
again
in
12
months
to
see
if
it
evens
out
i
could
drink
this
all
day
well
maybe
until
i
fell
down
smooth
smooth
smooth
hard
to
believe
at
15
abv
wonderful
unique
flavor
not
perfect
or
my
favorite
style
but
very
very
close
bottle
from
tipples
pours
orange
with
a
small
off
white
head
aroma
of
booze
sweet
caramel
figs
fruits
big
and
sweet
flavor
is
also
huge
sweetness
fruit
flavors
honey
and
caramel
booze
and
a
little
more
booze
heavy
bodied
medium
carbonation
hot
on
the
throat
this
was
decent
enough
i
guess
wouldnt
pay
the
5
or
6
again
for
a
bottle
again
though
o
good
brew
a
sipper
at
15
maybe
letting
it
age
will
take
some
of
the
alcohol
heat
bite
off
light
reddish
orange
body
medium
fast
dissipating
head
has
that
dogfish
head
smell
fruity
fig
aroma
very
fruity
tasting
for
a
barleywine
dense
orange
color
half
finger
head
on
the
pour
with
pour
retention
and
minimal
lacing
when
poured
into
snifter
glass
as
recommended
on
the
bottle
super
dense
rich
malty
aroma
with
nice
dark
fruits
mingled
within
did
i
mention
boozy
in
the
nose
wow
the
flavor
is
intense
heavy
malt
character
hits
right
away
with
a
maple
syrupsoaked
biscuit
quality
intensely
sweet
dark
fruits
hit
mid
drink
figs
and
dates
of
course
hops
are
mild
even
at
85
ibu
underneath
the
malt
fortress
hops
are
earthy
with
a
pinelike
herbal
tone
medicinal
quality
in
the
finish
almost
like
nyquil
and
probably
a
result
of
the
alcohol
dense
syrupy
body
about
as
thick
as
beer
can
get
i
think
very
different
would
serve
well
as
a
winter
warmer
will
try
to
cellar
and
compare
drink
with
the
utmost
care
and
respect
take
small
sips
i
dont
see
why
this
gets
so
much
hate
i
absolutely
love
the
taste
of
this
beer
i
think
the
upfront
burn
is
what
makes
it
so
great
ill
be
cellaring
the
other
3
to
see
how
this
one
develops
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
barley
wines
i
havent
had
many
but
this
one
is
close
to
the
top
of
the
list
o
very
good
overall
like
the
abv
and
smoothness
2014
smoothest
bw
i
have
ever
had
o
i
didnt
care
much
for
this
one
and
i
dont
really
get
all
the
high
ratings
for
it
it
seems
like
another
beer
dogfish
head
wants
you
to
age
before
you
drink
but
my
belief
is
a
beer
should
be
good
fresh
first
and
if
it
gets
better
with
some
age
well
that
is
a
bonus
would
like
to
try
this
with
some
age
but
i
really
dont
think
ill
be
buying
another
bottle
anytime
soon
o
this
beer
floors
me
for
15
i
remember
having
it
on
tap
a
year
ago
and
thinking
this
is
great
the
bottle
version
had
done
nothing
to
change
that
opinion
it
has
tastes
for
days
and
the
booze
for
being
15
is
well
hidden
still
somewhat
hot
though
not
all
that
unexpected
for
a
15
beer
the
flavor
was
quite
mellow
hmm
maybe
mellow
isnt
quite
the
right
word
and
maltforward
the
hops
were
there
but
not
overpowering
at
all
all
around
a
very
solid
beer
for
an
american
barleywine
i
wasnt
slammed
with
hops
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
definitely
picked
up
some
of
the
fruit
on
the
finish
quickly
followed
by
a
nice
alcohol
warmth
i
havent
had
a
ton
of
barleywines
but
this
is
already
a
favorite
im
thinking
ill
pick
up
a
couple
to
age
the
bold
body
accented
with
a
semifruity
flavor
gave
this
beer
a
great
overall
profile
i
personally
found
the
aftertaste
to
be
similar
to
that
of
honey
i
love
honey
a
superb
barley
wine
that
has
aged
excellently
there
is
some
oxidation
late
midpalate
that
manifests
as
a
metallic
twang
but
it
does
not
take
away
from
the
beer
at
hops
in
the
hills
this
summer
i
had
the
first
pour
off
a
fresh
keg
wow
i
usually
age
these
bottles
but
that
fresh
one
was
just
off
the
charts
of
incredible
vintage
2012
a
honey
colored
hue
on
the
pour
no
head
aroma
is
of
sweet
caramel
vanilla
woodsy
essence
very
fruity
and
yeast
some
sweet
alcohol
esters
as
well
taste
is
sweet
caramel
honey
and
vanilla
undertones
fruity
yeast
and
mild
spiced
hops
some
dark
intermingled
fruit
figs
and
dates
palate
is
full
flavored
creamy
smooth
and
nicely
balanced
wit
good
carbonation
the
finish
is
a
cornucopia
of
the
aforementioned
flavors
and
aromas
leaves
a
slight
tongue
numbing
feeling
from
the
alcohol
although
it
is
well
behaved
aging
seems
to
have
mellowed
it
out
which
i
find
enjoyable
leaves
a
nice
satisfyingly
warm
feeling
overall
a
very
good
smooth
and
enjoyable

fruitiness
and
darkbready
malt
sweetness
with
zero
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
lightmedium
carbonation
and
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
smooth
fairly
crisp
and
lightly
slick
mouthfeel
that
is
great
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
light
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
style
all
around
great
complexity
and
balance
of
fruitiness
and
darkbready
malt
sweetness
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
for
the
big
abv
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
a
really
nice
sipper
of
a
barleywine
again
this
is
a
dessert
beer
but
a
tasty
one
o
awesome
what
they
did
with
this
beer
so
strong
but
yet
so
well
balanced
overall
a
good
enough
beer
but
one
that
clearly
needs
some
age
to
be
enjoyable
id
heard
this
one
was
hot
if
you
drink
it
fresh
and
based
on
my
experience
at
six
months
id
have
a
hard
time
disagreeing
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
to
sit
on
a
bit
longer
and
see
how
it
was
drinking
after
a
year
but
for
the
time
being
its
a
decent
beer
id
also
change
the
classification
only
because
the
figs
add
a
sweetness
that
reminded
me
more
of
the
english
style
than
the
super
hoppy
bitter
american
style
o
its
a
huge
barleywine
big
on
the
booze
and
everything
else
at
15
its
definitely
one
that
good
to
sip
on
after
diner
wouldnt
want
many
more
than
that
for
the
alcohol
a
well
made
american
barleywine
style
brew
i
really
enjoyed
this
as
it
became
something
different
at
every
sip
plus
its
15pct
abv
and
made
me
feel
good
old
school
ale
has
a
good
appearance
in
a
glass
and
a
nice
white
head
with
the
smell
theres
alot
going
on
with
the
figs
and
dates
the
taste
is
just
too
much
and
by
that
i
mean
its
way
bitter
definitely
only
1
a
night
beer
the
abv
is
15
wich
is
overboard
and
you
can
definitely
taste
that
i
am
curious
what
this
beer
would
taste
like
aged
for
a
couple
years
and
i
think
thats
all
its
got
going
for
it
not
a
total
disappointment
just
another
one
for
the
craft
collection
o
a
big
gargantuan
barleywine
that
benefits
vastly
from
extended
aging
huge
flavor
but
very
sweet
the
flavor
lingers
the
sides
of
the
tongue
and
leaves
pleasant
hints
of
fruit
after
the
alcohol
bite
fades
o
overall
i
found
the
beer
a
bit
hard
to
drink
because
of
the
very
awkward
nose
it
has
a
wonderful
appearance
and
mouthfeel
however
the
taste
is
quite
bland
for
a
barleywine
of
any
type
but
especially
for
one
that
boasts
figs
and
dates
on
the
label
a
lone
date
has
more
flavor
and
complexity
than
this
beer
i
rated
the
flavor
as
okay
because
its
a
decent
tasting
high
alcohol
beer
just
not
one
i
would
boast
about
i
wont
be
buying
the
beer
again
o
it
is
pretty
good
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
but
that
is
to
be
expected
given
the
abv
it
makes
for
a
nice
sipper
on
a
chilly
spring
evening
m
medium
bodied
leading
to
full
this
folds
the
envelope
for
american
barleywines
and
becomes
a
liqueurlike
fruit
concoction
with
its
high
emphasis
on
the
fruits
and
sweet
aspects
of
the
malts
i
usually
do
not
like
american
barleywines
as
much
but
this
highly
resembles
its
english
counterpart
with
its
extra
sweet
fruity
malt
profile
if
they
could
somehow
throw
this
in
some
kind
of
barrel
im
thinking
rye
whiskey
or
sherry
this
would
only
further
reveal
its
obvious
liqueur
leaning
qualities
cheers
to
dfh
for
experimenting
as
always
although
maybe
they
should
consider
packaging
some
of
these
strong
beers
in
6oz
bottles
for
practical
purposes
im
happy
overall
with
my
5
year
aging
experiment
on
this
one
i
remember
it
being
very
hot
fresh
and
though
it
may
have
toned
down
a
bit
it
still
lets
you
know
that
its
15
abv
with
each
sip
final
thoughts
olde
school
has
reminded
me
of
why
i
like
the
barleywine
style
in
the
first
place
huge
flavor
and
delicate
balance
i
was
nearly
turned
off
of
the
style
after
initially
enjoying
it
because
of
the
many
poorly
made
brews
out
there
make
no
mistake
dfh
brews
the
real
deal
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
o
probably
my
favorite
beer
from
dfh
its
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
massive
sweet
yet
somehow
easy
drinking
relatively
barleywine
than
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
than
olde
school
i
cant
say
i
drink
very
much
dogfish
head
beer
but
olde
school
is
one
i
will
pick
up
in
the
future
this
is
a
beer
you
could
sit
on
for
years
with
no
poor
outcome
overall
amazing
flavors
and
unbelievable
drinkability
for
15
very
different
from
the
other
barleywines
today
but
very
true
to
the
style
wonderfully
brewed
beer
and
easily
a
top
barleywine
this
beer
is
pretty
good
not
as
smooth
or
drinkable
as
other
barleywines
ive
had
i
can
really
taste
the
alcohol
those
saying
it
has
no
carbonation
are
right
on
the
money
real
boozy
dark
fruit
taste
perhaps
not
my
thing
but
i
can
see
how
it
is
quality
and
how
snobs
would
like
it
2010
bottle
share
at
proof
poured
amber
brown
with
almost
no
head
aroma
is
a
warm
sweet
malty
bomb
with
a
slight
hint
of
dark
fruit
taste
is
somehow
sweet
citrus
earthy
and
a
touch
of
that
dark
fruit
kinda
boozey
medium
body
almost
no
carbonation
great
beer
overall
o
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
especially
at
cellar
temperature
there
is
so
much
to
enjoy
with
each
taste
it
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
if
there
is
any
less
desirable
trait
to
this
brew
it
would
be
a
touch
too
much
of
the
figs
it
coats
the
mouth
a
bit
in
my
opinion
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
barleywine
lovers
and
i
will
be
getting
more
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
with
all
its
different
flavors
and
i
didnt
realize
it
was
15
until
i
looked
at
the
bottle
defiantly
keeping
one
to
try
next
year
overall
a
year
on
this
brew
hasnt
yet
toned
down
the
alcohol
and
booze
on
this
brew
flavors
are
still
strong
but
this
needs
time
to
mellow
perhaps
23
years
serving
type
bottle
pretty
good
beer
in
my
opinion
nothing
really
went
above
and
beyond
for
me
but
i
would
enjoy
this
brew
again
in
the
future
cheers
well
done
the
beer
pours
a
light
and
creamy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
beer
is
a
deep
ruby
red
that
is
clear
the
beer
has
a
fairly
sweet
and
fruity
smell
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
some
hints
of
dark
fruits
but
sweet
malts
are
the
primary
smell
with
a
slight
hints
of
hops
the
taste
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
smell
sweet
malts
dominate
the
palates
with
dark
fruits
and
a
hint
of
hops
as
well
as
a
bit
of
alcohol
as
well
the
feel
is
fairly
syrupy
but
still
pretty
good
and
smooth
the
beer
is
heavy
bodied
but
still
feels
lighter
than
most
other
barleywine
overall
a
decent
barleywince
and
worth
buying
at
least
once
o
not
bad
for
what
it
is
i
am
a
big
fan
of
barley
wines
and
ive
had
better
but
this
is
still
a
pretty
good
beer
a
little
too
much
alcohol
but
hey
its
dogfish
head
what
do
you
expect
probably
would
go
nice
with
a
cigar
and
some
age
on
it
overall
this
is
a
great
cold
night
beer
warming
and
scotchlike
sure
to
warm
your
bones
bottled
in
2010
amber
orange
in
color
with
a
thick
viscous
look
poured
with
a
short
white
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
thin
wisps
dark
fruit
sweet
sugary
malt
and
toffee
aromas
are
prominent
with
butter
and
boozy
notes
at
the
back
end
a
quick
rush
of
carbonation
up
front
followed
by
a
smooth
slightly
oily
feel
through
the
middle
and
tangy
boozy
heat
at
the
end
dark
fruit
flavors
up
front
with
toffee
flavors
added
through
the
middle
tangy
bite
in
the
middle
leads
candied
orange
and
chardonnaylike
pear
flavors
finishes
dryly
with
a
tangy
slightly
tart
fruitiness
along
with
undeniable
but
mellow
boozy
heat
overall
this
is
a
solid
barleywine
with
a
fig
and
date
compliment
that
really
works
out
as
the
label
suggests
a
beer
that
will
develop
quite
well
overtime
great
sipping
beer
as
the
season
gets
colder
overall
this
was
complex
to
say
the
least
but
i
enjoyed
the
mix
of
flavors
the
alcohol
wasnt
hidden
but
it
didnt
over
power
this
was
the
nail
in
the
coffin
to
a
long
evening
so
next
time
i
try
this
i
might
have
it
as
the
starter
so
im
not
completely
wrecked
the
next
day
having
had
my
first
olde
school
which
was
a
2012
bottle
about
two
weeks
ago
i
was
eager
to
try
it
fresh
for
comparison
suffice
it
to
say
i
learned
the
importance
on
patience
with
this
one
its
quite
good
and
worth
trying
when
fresh
but
its
worlds
better
with
some
age
on
it
a
good
barleywine
that
truly
becomes
great
as
it
ages
aguably
my
favorite
from
dogfish
head
o
it
has
the
general
profile
of
an
englishstyle
barleywine
but
the
bigness
and
brute
force
of
a
merican
one
having
said
that
this
is
one
of
dfhs
better
offerings
and
obviously
a
great
aging
candidate
even
fresh
the
booze
is
hidden
relatively
well
relatively
if
i
ever
buy
this
again
down
in
the
ground
they
go
o
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
in
your
face
theres
just
something
about
it
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
that
throws
it
off
just
a
bit
anyway
it
is
a
must
try
overall
i
cant
help
but
think
about
how
this
one
will
age
but
i
will
snap
out
of
that
mindset
i
really
liked
this
one
a
lot
for
what
it
is
today
it
drinks
like
an
english
barleywine
even
though
it
has
the
spirit
of
the
american
brewing
revolution
overall
really
interesting
and
enjoyable
barleywine
while
the
alcohol
is
perceptible
i
am
amazed
at
how
easy
15
goes
down
glad
to
have
found
this
one
and
glad
to
have
picked
up
one
to
age
a
bit
overall
this
is
incredibly
well
balanced
for
being
15
abv
a
nice
sipper
for
sure
it
is
a
little
hot
for
being
about
3
weeks
old
maybe
some
aging
could
do
some
good
maybe
some
aging
in
some
merlot
barrels
could
do
this
really
good
other
than
that
this
brew
is
worthy
rating
to
style
i
have
less
experience
with
barleywine
than
i
do
with
a
lot
of
others
but
i
know
a
good
beer
when
its
sitting
right
in
front
of
me
this
is
a
good
beer
not
overly
complex
yet
it
still
exceeded
my
expectations
at
15
abv
im
sure
any
aspects
of
this
beer
that
you
dont
enjoy
will
soon
be
forgiven
all
in
all
this
is
my
favorite
offering
from
dogfish
head
thus
far
o
its
definitely
a
sipper
but
one
that
i
enjoyed
very
much
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
even
at
15
abv
a
year
in
the
cellar
was
perfect
for
this
beer
too
in
my
opinion
an
homage
to
times
past
not
sure
what
happened
here
but
its
hot
and
sweet
and
ultimately
lacks
some
of
the
more
complex
malts
i
like
to
see
in
the
style
its
not
awful
but
its
not
really
on
my
list
for
the
style
i
have
drained
the
glass
imparts
a
very
pleasant
bouquet
i
will
select
olde
school
over
any
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
i
bought
4
4packs
last
fall
and
have
aged
them
for
10
months
with
the
intention
of
bringing
them
out
infrequently
to
see
the
changes
with
age
they
are
so
awesome
tasting
that
after
bringing
out
a
couple
i
have
quickly
brought
out
the
rest
and
now
have
only
2
left
when
they
come
out
this
fall
i
will
buy
up
all
i
can
find
so
i
can
follow
through
on
my
original
plan
to
bring
out
some
at
various
intervals
to
enjoy
the
benefits
of
aging
overall
i
enjoy
it
big
flavors
albeit
not
supercomplex
a
good
find
for
big
beer
lovers
almost
definitely
better
with
age
o
the
age
took
way
some
of
its
punch
but
even
after
two
years
in
the
cellar
this
is
still
quite
boozy
it
drinks
like
a
cordial
rather
than
a
beer
and
a
potent
cordial
at
that
an
extreme
beer
in
that
it
is
very
high
in
abv
but
really
its
rather
onedimensional
and
alcoholdriven
but
i
suppose
if
you
like
big
beers
that
one
dimension
is
pretty
good
overall
probably
my
new
favorite
barleywine
o
aged
for
at
least
2
5
years
and
this
is
still
a
boozy
mess
and
the
cloyingly
sweet
corn
sugar
doesnt
help
that
any
i
dont
think
sams
massive
corn
sugar
additions
to
boost
abv
are
the
right
way
to
go
this
is
a
massive
barleywine
2011
vintage
here
and
i
am
thinking
i
should
have
given
it
another
year
or
even
two
to
cool
out
a
bit
more
this
beast
is
hot
pours
a
dense
amber
color
with
a
lot
of
yeast
floating
around
like
fish
food
and
a
prominent
off
white
head
over
an
inch
tall
but
not
lasting
a
real
long
time
the
nose
is
very
alcoholic
predictably
so
but
there
is
also
some
interesting
things
going
on
here
besides
the
malt
i
pick
up
a
lot
of
mediterranean
fruit
notes
like
figs
dates
and
drying
apples
it
is
sweet
in
taste
but
not
cloyingly
so
like
many
colossal
barleywines
the
dried
fruits
come
through
nicely
adding
complexity
to
a
huge
grain
bill
and
a
lot
of
brown
sugar
sweetness
the
alcohol
cuts
through
everything
and
when
this
beer
warms
up
it
feels
like
liquor
the
yeast
adds
a
lot
and
is
obviously
fairly
sturdy
with
some
white
toast
sort
of
elements
decent
carbonation
really
for
what
this
is
and
a
predictably
large
body
this
is
a
slow
sipper
and
even
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
was
a
little
more
than
i
wanted
so
maybe
share
this
with
a
friend
or
a
lover
i
probably
should
have
waited
until
fall
to
open
this
one
but
curiosity
got
the
best
of
me
on
a
warm
early
summer
afternoon
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
in
many
ways
more
enjoyable
than
say
a
bolt
cutter
with
all
the
fruit
happening
in
this
good
effort
b
overall
enjoyable
bw
to
sip
slowly
and
enjoy
it
warming
up
i
had
a
2012
fresh
last
year
and
its
similar
to
what
i
remember
still
havent
had
one
of
these
aged
yet
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
ages
the
barleywine
that
all
should
be
compared
to
in
my
opinion
poors
a
nice
reddishcopper
color
can
really
smell
the
fruit
datesfigs
and
initial
taste
can
be
slightly
harsh
but
smooths
out
after
a
few
sips
i
have
been
drinking
these
for
about
6
years
and
upset
that
this
will
actually
be
the
first
year
im
making
myself
age
them
will
followup
on
smellalcoholtaste
next
year
overall
i
know
its
15
but
it
doesnt
feel
or
taste
like
it
simply
amazing
and
im
looking
for
more
o
its
not
that
i
dont
like
this
beer
i
just
dont
find
it
to
be
very
interesting
drinkable
yes
exciting
no
for
a
dfh
beer
with
a
high
abv
and
similar
oakiness
see
my
username
overall
great
barleywine
and
even
better
that
its
15
still
have
yet
to
have
a
dfh
brew
i
dont
like
3
95
one
is
better
off
with
a
old
ruffian
a
hog
heaven
or
a
bigfoot
review
350
olde
school
was
a
light
orange
color
with
a
modest
white
head
it
left
some
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
in
the
aroma
i
discovered
malt
and
a
mild
level
of
hops
there
was
nothing
about
the
aroma
which
was
overwhelming
in
the
initial
taste
i
detected
notes
of
raisin
fig
mild
maltiness
and
a
respectable
level
of
nuttiness
for
an
american
barleywine
i
expected
more
hops
to
be
in
the
front
yet
at
the
same
time
i
was
not
disappointed
when
i
discovered
with
was
not
a
hopbomb
it
reminded
me
of
an
english
barleywine
the
high
level
abv
left
a
warming
sensation
with
the
nuttiness
progressing
toward
sour
in
the
finish
this
beer
makes
a
great
night
cap
on
a
cold
winter
night
in
recent
memory
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
dogfish
head
efforts
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
sweet
with
a
very
well
hidden
alcohol
taste
at
least
for
a
15
abv
brew
a
very
nice
and
quite
easy
drinking
for
a
barley
wine
delicious
o
i
really
liked
this
barleywine
its
massive
and
syrupy
i
bet
it
will
age
incredibly
o
intense
and
bold
bold
bold
bold
just
like
i
remember
120
minute
and
world
wide
stout
being
much
more
alcoholic
than
i
anticipated
but
at
the
same
time
now
that
i
think
about
it
that
was
really
rather
foolish
of
me
im
really
not
surprised
i
would
love
love
love
to
see
how
this
ages
overall
its
a
real
asskicker
drinkability
a
very
nice
barleywine
very
drinkable
for
15
overall
this
beer
has
aged
extremely
well
and
im
sorry
to
see
it
go
it
was
my
last
one
this
is
very
sippable
and
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
the
weirder
and
weirder
dogfish
head
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
grapevine
liquors
in
denver
which
is
a
nice
package
size
for
having
a
snifter
or
two
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
dry
texture
alcohol
warming
and
a
dry
finish
o
certainly
recommend
some
aging
at
current
state
it
has
a
great
base
some
mellowing
would
do
wonders
overall
after
the
first
couple
of
sips
i
thought
i
might
dump
it
now
i
think
ill
get
through
at
least
half
of
it
before
deciding
i
dont
need
any
more
alcohol
tonight
very
thick
mouthfeel
and
i
only
get
a
bit
of
the
booziness
with
the
high
abv
i
really
like
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
its
a
different
take
on
a
barelywine
but
not
totally
in
a
different
mold
i
definitely
recommend
it
o
this
one
was
interesting
and
interesting
is
not
always
a
good
thing
im
probably
giving
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
with
my
ratings
but
i
do
give
it
some
bonus
points
for
being
a
big
boozy
beer
its
not
necessarily
bad
and
for
a
15
barleywine
the
price
is
great
but
its
not
something
i
would
probably
drink
again
maybe
ill
grab
one
or
two
to
sit
on
for
a
number
of
years
and
see
if
it
gets
better
as
is
its
a
pass
unless
you
are
trying
to
get
drunk
cheaply
a
big
bad
barleywine
that
is
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
broad
and
complex
with
layers
of
flavor
the
booze
is
a
little
intrusive
o
i
am
taking
my
time
with
this
bad
boy
very
nice
complements
all
around
with
the
flavors
overall
impression
wow
i
really
like
this
beer
i
have
to
be
careful
at
15
this
will
kick
your
butt
very
smooth
and
drinkable
as
soon
as
i
swallow
i
want
another
taste
sip
on
this
guy
all
night
with
a
great
book
and
youll
be
just
fine
its
just
a
darn
good
beer
i
really
cannot
wait
to
see
what
a
year
or
2
does
to
this
guyif
i
can
resist
that
long
did
i
mention
that
i
really
like
thisjust
a
great
brew
that
blew
my
mind
i
will
probably
look
for
this
every
time
it
comes
out
it
is
not
fair
it
just
gets
better
with
every
sip
d
for
how
fresh
this
is
im
really
enjoying
it
i
expected
even
more
of
a
hot
mess
like
some
of
dfh
other
big
bodied
brews
however
everything
seems
to
work
nicely
here
and
gives
me
something
to
look
forward
to
for
the
bottle
in
my
cellar
this
is
a
very
interesting
barleywine
i
did
not
expect
the
intense
citrusy
hop
character
the
malt
character
is
pretty
decent
its
sweet
but
not
cloying
there
are
hints
of
candy
sugar
and
vanilla
throughout
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
15
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
is
worth
trying
but
for
me
i
would
prefer
either
a
more
malt
forward
beer
or
a
less
citrusy
hop
character
overall
not
much
complexity
on
the
nose
flavor
is
really
good
and
surprisingly
mellow
o
a
really
nice
barleywine
it
took
4
years
in
stride
and
could
probably
even
take
another
2
to
reach
peak
condition
nice
profile
nice
integration
and
great
mouthfeel
this
is
a
robust
beer
to
say
the
least
and
i
really
like
what
dfh
has
done
with
it
so
much
character
and
yet
quite
drinkable
it
actually
reminds
of
dextra
just
a
touch
overall
would
i
buy
it
again
honestly
i
would
have
to
think
about
it
depends
in
the
mood
that
i
am
in
barleywines
are
everywhere
and
there
are
some
that
are
easier
to
find
than
this
one
i
would
buy
it
because
of
its
strong
abv
level
and
thats
pretty
much
it
i
am
not
knocking
it
everyone
should
try
it
rarely
you
get
a
something
as
unique
as
this
salud
highly
recommended
i
anxious
to
see
how
this
brew
does
with
5years
behind
it
more
to
come
nice
work
dfh
o
amazing
how
this
brew
is
15
it
is
hidden
quite
nicely
which
can
be
dangerous
this
is
worth
a
try
for
sure
but
it
doesnt
knock
your
sox
off
like
other
dfh
beers
o
an
interesting
and
solid
barleywine
from
dogfish
head
but
certainly
not
exceptional
its
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
i
prefer
both
english
and
american
styles
but
the
balance
on
this
is
not
on
point
im
not
complaining
about
the
alcohol
heat
its
15
id
like
to
revist
this
in
a
bottle
with
a
year
or
two
on
it
well
this
was
my
first
goaround
with
dfhs
olde
school
but
it
certainly
wont
be
my
last
while
the
price
and
abv
will
certainly
keep
this
out
of
the
regular
lineup
for
me
this
is
a
great
brew
to
pick
up
once
in
a
while
when
i
want
a
big
bold
barleywine
o
very
true
to
the
style
a
great
sipper
packed
with
tons
of
flavor
this
beer
would
definitely
benefit
from
some
aging
to
tame
the
heat
a
bit
looks
nicely
carbonated
for
a
barley
wine
got
a
half
inch
of
head
though
it
quickly
diminished
a
nice
clean
reddish
brown
pour
smells
of
grapes
tea
leaves
vanilla
caramel
heavy
booze
scent
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
up
front
with
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
malt
heavy
sugary
sweet
with
a
banana
like
overtone
and
a
wooden
oak
flavor
in
the
finish
full
body
moderately
carbonated
very
syrupy
very
heavy
on
the
booze
nice
instant
chest
warming
overall
a
very
nice
barleywine
and
one
hell
of
a
sipper
for
being
15
abv
you
cant
tell
that
much
ive
had
9
beers
that
were
way
more
overwhelming
with
the
alcohol
taste
than
this
one
glad
i
finally
got
myself
some
of
this
one
its
been
impossible
to
find
for
the
previous
years
pretty
good
american
barleywine
from
dfh
certainly
not
anything
groundbreaking
here
but
at
15
a
4pack
its
certainly
not
a
bad
choice
im
most
impressed
with
dogfish
head
on
thisun
and
to
think
its
the
first
time
around
for
me
on
this
one
and
i
have
a
fourpack
from
last
year
saved
further
reviews
to
come
oa
solid
barleywine
not
a
messy
overly
sweetened
hop
bomb
that
i
have
come
to
expect
of
the
style
fairly
smooth
flavors
for
being
such
a
young
beer
but
i
definitely
aging
will
serve
this
beer
well
o
complex
but
thats
barleywines
i
think
it
may
be
a
little
too
strong
but
if
im
patient
enough
ill
let
one
of
these
age
and
try
to
review
it
again
right
now
though
i
think
it
is
still
quality
and
best
enjoyed
after
a
long
exhausting
day
o
sweet
and
boozey
barleywine
at
15
youd
have
to
expect
it
well
rounded
beer
complex
on
all
fronts
big
sweet
rasins
and
dark
fruits
really
shine
through
i
would
assume
these
will
come
together
a
bit
more
with
some
age
o
i
love
dogfish
head
products
and
barleywines
but
i
would
have
to
rate
this
as
fairly
average
it
had
nothing
to
set
it
apart
from
the
rest
nor
to
elevate
it
above
them
but
it
was
of
course
a
very
enjoyable
barleywine
and
of
course
id
buy
it
again
o
this
is
a
good
sweet
barley
wine
that
will
defiantly
warm
you
right
up
could
see
this
aging
very
well
like
the
label
suggest
guess
its
time
to
go
dig
a
2x2
3
foot
deep
hole
cheers
o
overall
are
you
sure
this
isnt
a
bsda
has
all
the
makings
of
a
classic
one
either
way
i
like
it
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
will
look
for
more
of
and
that
im
glad
i
got
a
4
pack
instead
of
a
single
interested
to
see
what
time
does
winner
fresh
had
a
bottle
of
2011
a
least
that
attempt
at
cellaring
went
well
does
now
seem
like
an
english
barleywine
more
sweet
fruit
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
not
so
much
hop
bottled
on
11212008
overall
fantastic
like
i
said
dont
drink
unless
you
set
it
asside
for
a
year
or
more
october
2011
bottle
bought
about
1
year
from
purchase
to
taste
i
only
aged
it
because
it
told
me
to
and
believe
me
it
was
worth
it
everyone
loved
it
nice
pungent
aroma
as
soon
as
it
was
poured
like
a
red
wine
not
what
i
was
expecting
even
though
it
is
a
barleywine
as
i
tasted
it
and
let
it
sit
the
more
complex
the
taste
and
aromas
became
it
took
on
more
of
a
red
wine
character
with
the
complexity
of
this
one
i
really
should
have
reviewed
it
on
the
spot
but
unfortunately
itll
be
at
least
a
year
before
i
can
get
another
1
year
old
olde
school
but
nonetheless
it
is
one
more
reason
to
but
and
age
another
4
pack
or
4
cases
for
that
matter
this
beer
is
a
dark
caramel
redbrown
color
with
a
just
off
white
head
about
2
cm
which
recedes
to
a
film
shortly
spotty
lacing
aroma
is
caramel
molasses
burnt
sugar
and
fruit
forward
a
bit
of
heat
but
very
nice
unfortunately
this
beer
really
doesnt
deliver
acetone
burnt
sugar
heat
solventy
and
figs
sweet
and
solvents
are
the
two
words
i
would
use
to
describe
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
somehow
worse
thin
hot
mid
level
carbonation
if
it
was
going
to
be
that
thin
it
needs
to
be
less
carbonated
and
it
needed
a
lot
more
body
really
not
a
good
beer
fuller
medium
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
dry
on
the
tongue
i
enjoy
barleywines
and
high
abv
beers
but
this
one
falls
towards
the
bottom
for
me
even
after
2
years
this
is
still
hot
as
hell
o
like
the
other
dfh
neon
caps
this
one
is
damn
sweet
and
not
shy
about
the
booze
on
the
palate
i
think
i
picked
the
wrong
month
to
drink
this
as
it
would
be
perfect
for
a
cold
winter
night
it
isnt
the
best
bw
i
have
had
but
it
isnt
bad
i
usually
dont
like
overly
sweet
beers
but
i
recommend
trying
this
one
if
you
can
find
it
one
of
the
better
barleywines
and
dogfish
head
brews
ive
had
in
a
while
a
year
of
age
on
the
bottle
seems
about
perfect
with
no
glaring
oxidation
4
5
when
i
poured
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
dark
copper
body
with
a
small
cream
color
head
that
lays
down
quiclky
to
a
thin
sticky
lace
around
the
body
the
aroma
is
tart
of
dark
fruits
like
figs
raisins
the
taste
is
sweet
and
strong
of
dark
fruit
and
booze
the
mouth
feel
is
very
thick
on
the
tongue
overall
this
isnt
my
kind
of
style
but
i
think
with
age
it
might
cool
down
a
little
bit
and
not
be
so
hot
as
it
turns
out
this
is
perhaps
the
most
palatable
dogfish
head
high
alcohol
sugar
bomb
at
least
as
its
aged
thus
far
aside
from
the
tarnishing
oxidation
there
are
lot
of
quite
good
qualities
in
this
dense
critter
of
a
barleywine
ill
be
looking
forward
to
drinking
my
last
bottle
somewhere
else
down
the
line
man
i
love
flanagans
song
overall
this
is
not
a
great
barelywine
its
a
nice
dessert
sipper
with
some
nice
flavor
notes
but
its
lacking
a
certain
depth
or
complexity
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
the
pour
is
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
pretty
brutal
aroma
a
bit
of
rubber
cement
and
rubbing
alcohol
theres
a
little
bit
of
candied
citrus
in
there
and
some
caramel
the
flavor
isnt
quite
as
brutal
as
the
aroma
at
first
anyway
lots
of
booze
some
rubbing
alcohol
and
more
booze
caramel
and
citrus
flavors
are
also
present
but
they
give
way
to
the
less
desirable
ones
as
it
warms
over
all
a
very
nice
barleywine
it
soothes
what
troubles
you
enjoy
with
caution
taste
is
of
woody
cedar
hops
and
apricot
a
bit
of
vanilla
boozey
oak
as
well
this
is
so
much
more
mellow
aged
and
absolutely
fantastic
so
privileged
to
have
tried
age
your
olde
school
o
if
you
want
a
big
sweet
beer
this
one
is
for
you
it
is
a
big
beer
but
aging
seems
to
be
a
must
on
this
one
if
you
dont
want
it
to
be
a
big
hot
punch
when
you
drink
it
i
like
what
aging
has
done
to
this
one
cheers
this
is
a
solid
and
unique
barleywine
and
about
what
i
expected
from
dfh
originally
reviewed
11222010
for
the
abv
it
is
pretty
amazingly
hidden
im
going
extra
5
point
for
that
wild
have
guessed
11
15
wow
o
definitely
complex
but
i
would
like
to
see
how
this
ages
but
overall
kind
of
a
hot
mess
right
now
a
lot
of
qualities
have
this
resembling
a
liquor
almost
as
much
as
a
beer
glad
i
tried
it
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
o
olde
school
challenges
the
very
definition
of
beer
and
is
another
amazing
offering
from
dh
undoubtedly
the
most
unique
barleywine
i
have
ever
sampled
this
is
an
intense
beer
not
only
due
to
the
high
abv
but
also
because
of
the
complexity
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
this
a
remarkable
sipping
experience
and
one
that
you
cannot
rush
note
it
took
me
over
112
hours
to
consume
a
12oz
bottle
overall
great
barleywine
in
my
opinion
because
it
isnt
too
sweet
for
me
i
love
the
hoppy
finish
typical
dogfish
beer
2009
bottle
reviewed
this
ages
incredibly
gracefully
o
alcohol
dominates
nice
raisiny
fruit
flavors
give
some
dimension
to
the
beer
lightly
boozy
in
the
taste
but
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
it
to
be
anywhere
near
15
abv
a
unique
and
enjoyable
barleywine
but
not
close
to
the
top
tier
in
the
flavor
category
pours
to
rich
but
thin
head
and
minimal
lace
aroma
isclover
honey
and
vanilla
flavor
is
a
mix
of
bubblegum
apples
pears
and
sweet
malt
alcoholic
finish
mouthfeel
features
a
nice
alcohol
burn
and
low
co2am
overall
a
drinkable
complex
and
slkow
drinking
strong
beer
hope
to
taste
an
aged
one
soon
o
delicious
unique
sweet
would
have
loved
to
have
tried
it
unaged
but
now
i
feel
ill
just
be
disappointed
o
havent
dabbled
much
into
barleywine
and
though
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
was
probably
not
what
i
was
in
the
mood
for
when
i
ordered
it
i
didnt
notice
the
15
abv
until
after
it
was
poured
in
front
of
me
but
overall
i
was
pretty
pleased
with
it
but
i
dont
think
i
could
see
myself
order
more
than
a
bottle
of
this
o
this
is
a
phenomenal
barleywine
definitely
one
of
the
top
5
best
ive
had
i
havent
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
fresh
but
with
a
few
years
to
age
it
really
mellowed
out
the
booze
and
brought
out
the
deliciously
fruity
sweet
flavors
i
definitely
need
to
find
more
o
mouthfeel
is
way
out
of
place
on
this
one
but
if
you
can
get
past
the
heat
and
a
carbonation
level
that
is
far
too
aggressive
i
think
this
is
a
very
solid
barleywine
especially
for
one
so
readily
available
off
the
shelves
its
not
going
to
take
a
run
at
the
top
examples
of
the
style
great
gratitude
but
it
holds
its
own
not
too
often
i
can
give
a
2
5
on
one
of
the
factors
and
still
end
up
with
a
decent
review
leave
it
to
dfh
to
break
yet
another
trend
overall
needs
a
bit
of
mellowing
true
american
style
barleywine
and
it
flaunts
it
well
a
bit
to
sweet
and
a
little
over
the
top
alc
but
excellent
malts
flavor
if
you
have
ever
said
what
exactly
is
a
american
barleywine
let
this
beer
be
your
template
to
base
your
general
opinion
of
the
class
on
that
being
said
its
not
great
but
its
what
it
says
it
is
half
finger
head
with
minimal
lacing
on
a
crimson
with
light
golden
hues
body
aroma
is
very
minty
sweet
and
boozy
flavor
is
sweet
with
syrupy
bourbon
dark
fruit
and
chardonnay
notes
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
too
boozy
and
sweet
for
me
but
i
was
expecting
this
a
nice
one
to
try
but
not
your
everyday
beer
obviously
o
at
the
barleywine
festival
that
i
attended
where
this
2010
vintage
was
on
tap
it
was
in
my
top
3
the
overall
fruity
flavor
with
the
kick
from
the
high
alcohol
content
was
appealing
id
imagine
it
only
improves
with
age
overall
this
is
not
the
best
barleywine
in
the
world
fresh
to
start
w
as
i
dont
much
care
for
it
fresh
however
i
can
finish
a
12oz
bottle
and
am
starting
to
enjoy
it
a
bit
at
4
years
of
age
personally
i
agree
w
the
bottle
that
the
best
idea
for
this
bottle
is
to
dig
a
hole
bury
it
and
forget
about
it
in
10
years
this
brew
will
probably
be
fantastic
olde
school
is
a
great
barleywine
other
examples
are
such
powerhouses
that
while
great
on
their
own
become
too
much
to
handle
dogfish
head
hit
the
mark
with
this
one
and
i
look
forward
to
others
in
the
future
wow
prepare
yourself
for
this
one
the
high
alcohol
content
is
very
obvious
ive
had
plenty
of
barley
wines
and
this
is
one
of
the
most
potent
ones
ive
had
the
alcohol
is
very
present
in
the
nose
and
taste
its
almost
balanced
out
by
the
sweetness
but
is
still
dominant
i
need
to
let
some
of
these
age
but
i
keep
drinking
them
o
a
good
beer
a
big
beer
would
recommend
but
only
to
those
liking
bigger
beers
or
those
with
beer
experience
nice
overall
i
could
see
this
being
a
bit
much
fresh
but
after
a
couple
of
years
of
age
it
is
rather
nice
something
to
sip
on
a
cold
night
and
enjoy
overall
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
such
a
strong
beer
granted
i
am
not
going
to
be
pounding
these
it
is
definitely
one
of
those
cold
weather
sipping
beers
alcohol
does
make
itself
apparent
only
from
its
effects
not
the
taste
overall
a
nice
example
of
a
barleywine
that
i
would
try
again
if
only
it
were
legally
available
here
in
ohio
overall
truly
a
pleasure
to
imbibe
it
is
very
strong
but
also
uniquely
tasty
the
bottle
suggests
burying
a
fresh
bottle
for
a
year
and
then
to
enjoy
dusting
this
off
from
the
cellar
was
a
delight
another
score
for
dogfish
head
here
hear
final
thought
5
a
pop
and
15
plus
abv
i
love
this
beer
i
was
slightly
disappointed
that
the
alcohol
was
not
better
hidden
for
a
beer
at
this
pricepoint
i
expected
a
little
more
sophistication
may
be
worth
purchasing
a
few
bottles
and
cellaring
for
a
good
five
years
overall
this
drinks
like
a
spirit
and
should
probably
be
treated
as
such
its
sweet
and
fruity
from
massive
amounts
of
malts
and
a
strong
yeast
strain
great
for
sipping
or
sharing
o
a
solid
beer
dangerously
easy
to
drink
poured
into
my
spidey
pint
glass
following
the
giants
playoff
victory
over
the
falcons
lots
of
head
overflowed
the
pint
glass
dark
orange
color
very
hazy
lots
of
particulates
smells
sweet
and
boozy
tastes
sweet
and
boozy
and
of
victory
seriously
i
get
an
oaky
taste
behind
the
booze
not
my
favorite
barleywine
but
one
of
the
strongest
and
therefore
one
of
the
most
jacked
very
thick
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
serious
barleywine
i
would
probabley
enjoy
this
one
a
bit
more
on
a
cold
saturday
night
in
late
january
or
february
but
tonight
will
have
to
do
pours
a
very
cloudy
orangerust
color
a
few
small
streams
of
bubbles
cascade
to
the
surface
a
very
thin
layer
of
head
after
pouring
it
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
boozy
aside
from
that
there
are
smells
of
sweet
dark
fruits
the
first
sip
starts
off
real
sweet
but
is
immediately
overwhelmed
by
a
lot
of
alcohol
bite
i
would
say
its
almost
too
much
but
i
do
prefer
stronger
beers
that
being
said
i
would
love
to
try
one
of
these
with
a
year
or
two
on
it
there
is
a
weird
sticky
mouth
feel
that
is
left
behind
after
swallowing
overall
this
is
an
interesting
barley
wine
probably
a
little
too
hot
for
most
but
it
does
have
some
interesting
flavors
and
would
probably
be
better
with
a
year
or
two
on
it
o
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
the
thought
this
was
going
to
be
a
very
hot
beer
despite
being
a
couple
years
old
while
not
the
best
barleywine
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
thanks
again
hosp
overall
a
definite
sipper
and
great
cellar
candidate
very
enjoyable
overall
exceptional
beer
thats
getting
better
and
better
with
age
thick
and
syrupy
lower
carbonation
palatenumbing
booze
that
deadens
the
flavors
a
bit
though
there
are
some
muted
dried
fruit
notes
not
picking
up
on
much
hop
flavor
theres
a
tiny
bit
of
earthy
bitterness
but
its
hard
to
discern
up
against
the
heavy
alcohol
astringency
this
is
just
not
that
drinkable
the
booze
is
a
bit
rough
maybe
the
heat
mellows
over
time
but
based
on
this
draft
its
not
really
worth
the
time
money
to
find
out
owhat
a
difference
a
year
makes
fresh
it
was
a
boozy
mess
with
a
year
on
it
the
alcohol
has
faded
and
flavors
are
allowed
to
come
out
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
the
age
has
treated
it
nicely
but
it
still
retains
its
bite
and
warmth
o
ok
but
nothing
compared
to
some
of
the
other
bw
i
have
been
drinking
lately
like
moas
had
better
barleywines
but
this
is
far
from
horrid
maybe
last
25
is
a
task
to
finish
due
to
high
abv
perfect
barleywine
to
share
will
try
to
sit
on
atleast
one
and
let
age
i
did
not
realized
this
was
15
abv
until
pouring
my
god
pours
a
translucent
rubycarmel
color
with
the
thinnest
of
heads
that
leaves
but
trace
amounts
of
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
a
mix
of
caramel
and
alcohol
you
know
this
is
one
boozy
bastard
the
taste
affirms
the
smell
this
is
an
alcohol
bomb
theres
some
subtle
hints
of
caramel
toffee
and
vanilla
but
the
alcohol
dominates
through
and
through
this
right
here
will
take
the
chill
off
any
december
day
regardless
of
the
line
of
latitude
upon
which
you
reside
the
mouthfeel
is
hot
as
hell
let
a
mouthful
of
this
rest
on
your
palate
for
1015
seconds
and
it
feels
like
the
insides
of
your
mouth
are
being
dissolved
its
very
astringent
and
has
a
monster
bite
the
aftertaste
is
just
boozy
someone
could
smell
this
on
your
breath
from
several
meters
out
dont
drink
this
and
expect
a
pleasant
response
from
the
popo
if
you
can
pulled
over
on
the
way
home
overall
this
is
a
pass
not
a
big
fan
id
recommend
sharing
even
a
12
oz
bottle
among
34
people
i
will
say
id
be
curious
as
to
what
this
could
turn
into
after
being
layed
down
for
5
years
but
it
needs
time
it
needs
something
its
current
state
just
does
nothing
for
me
in
a
landscape
full
of
luscious
barleywines
too
easy
to
drink
nice
rich
sipper
well
as
you
most
probably
guessed
it
this
is
a
sipper
the
aroma
and
warmth
had
detection
of
alcohol
but
very
little
with
the
taste
two
thirds
done
and
i
got
a
buzz
going
overall
i
am
impressed
with
this
barleywine
by
dogfish
i
am
more
impressed
with
this
than
their
other
abv
bomb
world
wide
stout
i
can
taste
the
flavors
in
this
unlike
wws
where
it
tasted
like
rubbing
alcohol
i
am
going
to
age
the
other
three
bottles
in
my
closet
medium
bodied
strong
carbonation
stronger
alcohol
burn
a
sipper
for
sure
o
pretty
decent
barleywine
but
nothing
super
special
very
boozy
probably
needs
a
good
510
years
and
i
bet
it
would
be
quite
nice
o
not
real
impressed
with
it
fresh
might
as
well
be
chuggin
rubbing
alochol
ill
seek
out
more
to
age
hopefully
this
is
not
a
hot
mess
with
some
time
on
it
o
ok
this
is
good
but
not
a
beer
i
would
have
one
after
the
other
one
is
plenty
but
definitely
good
dfh
seems
to
always
do
something
different
and
this
really
is
to
me
intense
fruits
and
intense
alcohol
blended
together
very
well
has
won
me
over
this
would
be
best
with
desert
cheeses
or
would
it
be
weird
if
i
said
sushi
o
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
its
not
bad
but
hasnt
hit
good
yet
this
beer
definitely
has
promise
with
the
sweetness
and
flavors
it
already
has
if
that
alcohol
bite
dies
down
this
might
be
an
awesome
beer
overall
good
nose
but
the
flavor
is
way
too
much
too
much
alcohol
and
too
much
sweetness
12
oz
to
english
pub
glass
beautiful
crystal
walnut
color
with
fine
pencil
line
cream
head
smell
is
pretty
terrible
like
glue
or
adhesive
maybe
nail
polish
remover
taste
follows
a
bit
with
some
very
tasty
malt
notes
and
burnt
sugar
and
heavy
prune
but
that
chemical
taste
dominates
alcohol
is
high
but
bearable
ok
and
different
but
i
wish
i
didnt
buy
a
4
pack
will
put
the
rest
away
for
like
5
years
this
brew
needs
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
time
to
sit
o
the
flavour
is
overwhelming
by
the
figsdates
resulting
in
an
incredibly
sweet
beer
that
is
at
times
a
chore
to
drink
it
needs
more
balance
and
more
hops
i
would
not
have
another
one
fresh
maybe
its
better
aged
o
i
couldnt
get
through
the
whole
12
oz
bottle
but
in
fairness
the
label
does
suggest
sharing
it
the
alcohol
burn
was
just
too
much
for
me
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
abit
too
much
on
the
sweet
side
maybe
it
was
aged
too
much
but
i
felt
it
needed
a
little
more
hops
or
alcohol
to
push
it
to
elite
status
of
barleywines
drinkability
is
still
great
for
such
a
strong
beer
though
will
have
to
buy
another
bottle
and
not
age
it
as
long
im
ok
with
this
one
even
though
this
has
a
level
of
harshness
that
takes
away
from
your
desire
to
drink
more
off
it
and
the
harshness
is
the
of
abv
the
12
oz
bottle
recommends
pouring
into
2
snifters
i
agree
i
had
no
desire
to
drink
the
last
quarter
of
goblet
and
i
took
forever
to
finish
what
i
had
cannot
imagine
what
id
do
with
a
bomber
of
this
still
good
and
very
well
structured
brew
o
while
there
are
some
hiccups
along
the
way
this
is
a
solidly
made
drinkable
beer
o
this
beer
is
shit
gimmick
never
again
d
this
one
is
pretty
fiery
even
world
wide
stout
goes
down
much
easier
may
have
been
better
if
i
took
the
bottles
directions
and
buried
this
one
for
a
year
before
drinking
this
beer
was
a
striking
copperorange
with
a
finger
of
head
and
no
retention
the
nose
is
distinctly
that
of
whiskey
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
but
not
unpleasantly
so
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
burn
at
the
end
but
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
considering
it
checks
in
at
15
the
warm
feeling
as
it
goes
down
makes
this
the
perfect
beer
to
sip
by
the
fire
on
a
cold
winter
night
o
this
was
easily
the
best
of
the
three
the
11
was
a
malt
bomb
and
nothing
else
and
the
13
was
still
a
little
raw
if
you
are
going
to
age
these
i
would
say
two
years
is
the
perfect
amount
o
well
balanced
and
flavorful
barleywine
a
little
different
than
what
im
used
to
in
the
style
this
features
way
more
sweet
malts
and
fruity
notes
and
less
hops
than
im
used
to
in
an
american
barleywine
87
overall
a
perfectly
balanced
high
alcohol
beer
well
made
as
indicated
by
the
way
alcohol
is
experienced
throughout
the
tasting
hops
presence
is
there
in
bitterness
and
slightly
in
taste
but
is
not
prominent
o
a
good
barley
wine
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
cannot
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
i
recommend
the
experience
if
you
have
the
opportunity
final
thoughts
this
beer
is
more
fruity
and
hot
than
other
barleywines
however
it
is
a
pleasant
experience
to
sip
over
an
hour
or
so
while
reading
a
good
book
definitely
not
a
session
beer
o
wow
awesome
barley
wine
definitely
a
sipper
at
15
abv
one
of
these
bad
boys
will
put
you
away
for
the
night
will
likely
be
better
after
aging
i
just
cant
wait
drinkabilityoverall
this
is
certainly
a
beer
that
i
would
be
very
interested
to
see
how
would
mature
with
age
the
alcohol
is
def
stronger
as
you
go
on
in
terms
flavor
being
noticable
certainly
not
a
very
hoppy
barley
wine
which
is
some
what
expected
considering
the
alcohol
being
so
high
i
would
say
certain
considering
this
beers
high
level
of
abv
it
was
very
enjoyable
and
balance
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
for
the
massive
amount
of
alcohol
i
think
that
this
is
a
classic
example
of
a
beer
that
will
be
great
with
some
age
on
it
a
must
have
do
a
slow
sipping
beer
very
filling
alcohol
is
incredibly
high
good
for
sitting
at
home
on
a
cold
night
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
carbonated
and
very
quickly
warming
medium
to
full
bodied
slightly
coating
on
the
palate
rather
thick
as
i
would
have
imagined
lots
of
alcohol
a
cloying
sweetness
and
more
alcohol
overall
very
good
beer
overall
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
but
its
definitely
the
most
extreme
another
solid
offering
from
dogfish
head
this
is
neat
its
not
a
barleywine
in
the
american
superhoppy
with
some
malt
to
balance
it
or
a
belgian
strong
superfruity
with
some
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
or
a
british
barleywine
supermaltyrich
with
some
hops
to
keep
it
in
check
its
a
middle
ground
that
it
working
well
fresh
but
you
can
bet
ill
be
getting
some
to
age
o
im
not
a
fan
of
this
one
its
too
boozy
thick
and
syrupy
to
thoroughly
enjoy
overall
this
is
a
great
sipping
brew
very
tasty
and
surprisingly
smooth
for
15
abv
looking
forward
to
trying
this
aged
cheers
edit
just
had
it
on
tap
and
its
fabulous
dark
fruit
galore
and
while
a
bit
hot
very
smooth
ogoing
to
give
my
remaining
bottles
at
least
another
2
years
in
the
cellar
i
opened
it
at
room
temperature
and
was
having
a
hard
time
getting
through
it
i
put
the
bottle
in
the
fridge
for
a
few
minutes
and
found
it
more
drinkable
when
lightly
chilled
o
very
interesting
beer
almost
like
sipping
brandy
out
of
a
snifter
nice
flavor
and
body
along
with
a
scent
that
reminds
me
of
some
homebrewed
meads
recommended
to
try
if
you
like
spirits
and
i
think
ill
take
the
bottles
offer
on
aging
one
o
i
wish
i
had
a
five
year
vert
of
this
so
happy
that
i
have
near
a
case
of
this
i
love
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
punch
really
warming
on
a
cold
fall
night
o
olde
school
is
a
great
barleywine
i
had
it
fresh
and
it
was
very
drinkable
i
put
a
few
bottles
away
for
aging
and
am
curious
to
how
itll
taste
in
the
future
at
15
abv
it
does
a
surprisingly
good
job
of
not
just
being
an
alcohol
bomb
definitely
worth
your
time
overall
i
am
surprised
at
this
years
offering
i
have
had
vintages
and
was
in
love
with
them
i
guess
these
need
some
age
to
get
something
amazing
to
come
of
them
but
for
a
fresh
bottle
it
is
wayyyy
to
harsh
i
cant
get
over
the
watered
down
vodka
feel
in
the
back
of
the
tongue
it
kind
of
grosses
me
outh
it
is
like
a
34
beer
34
are
great
and
the
other
fourth
is
just
disgusting
overall
decent
though
tm
and
o
wow
this
is
extreme
for
sure
but
im
not
sure
if
thats
a
good
thing
i
cant
pull
anything
outta
this
besides
alcohol
not
really
sure
what
they
were
trying
to
do
with
this
barletwine
but
olde
school
has
none
of
the
characteristics
of
a
barleywine
well
at
least
none
that
ive
ever
tried
im
gonna
try
to
finish
this
one
but
i
doubt
i
will
ill
age
the
other
with
hopes
that
it
really
transforms
over
time
i
hope
to
revisit
this
one
in
a
year
or
so
but
for
now
definitely
a
nice
winter
belly
warmer
to
sip
at
night
but
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
overall
i
like
my
barleywines
and
this
one
is
included
i
cracked
a
fresh
bottle
out
of
the
case
which
i
plan
to
cellar
and
enjoy
after
some
time
i
suggest
if
you
like
barleywines
to
get
this
a
try
with
out
a
doubt
t
i
expected
a
huge
burn
from
the
alcohol
but
it
was
actually
pretty
well
hidden
brandy
soaked
apricots
honey
golden
raisins
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
really
drinkable
and
a
very
solid
barleywine
i
would
love
to
get
a
few
bottles
of
this
one
overall
i
was
expecting
a
very
high
abv
barleywine
and
got
it
i
guess
i
will
have
to
bury
a
bottle
or
two
under
my
bed
for
a
year
and
see
how
it
turns
out
for
me
it
seemed
less
of
a
burn
than
young
world
wide
stout
and
more
drinkable
for
half
the
cost
it
was
worth
the
experience
o
right
now
this
is
pretty
boozy
and
hot
but
man
is
this
gonna
age
well
you
can
obviously
tell
its
a
young
barleywine
thats
meant
to
be
aged
for
15
or
even
more
years
but
its
still
drinking
well
now
as
long
as
you
dont
mind
the
heat
the
dark
fruits
play
well
with
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
well
enough
that
you
want
to
drink
it
quickly
but
this
is
a
definite
sipper
especially
at
this
young
pours
a
reddish
copper
color
with
no
head
but
great
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malts
and
slight
alcohol
taste
follows
the
nose
no
alcohol
burn
raisins
and
figs
cherries
also
present
slightly
chewy
but
goes
down
smooth
not
mind
blowing
but
its
still
a
really
good
barley
wine
this
vintage
im
drinking
is
less
than
a
month
from
hitting
the
shelves
so
maybe
in
a
few
years
the
tastes
would
mellow
each
other
out
i
will
definitely
have
to
take
the
advice
on
the
bottle
and
bury
a
few
for
a
couple
years
and
compare
notes
happy
to
try
anything
from
dfh
fresh
though
good
beer
careful
the
alcohol
in
this
one
is
liable
to
sneak
up
on
you
probably
not
going
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
definitely
a
sipper
with
a
very
nice
sweet
taste
appearance
is
a
transparent
golden
amber
with
a
thin
halo
of
white
head
smell
is
fruity
and
sweet
very
pleasant
taste
is
candylike
hops
with
a
fruity
back
palate
is
slick
and
light
tingles
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
overall
one
of
the
better
barleywines
looking
forward
to
the
bottle
i
am
aging
i
just
dont
know
if
it
should
be
for
a
year
or
two
overall
i
am
not
100
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
beer
on
one
hand
it
really
is
a
very
complex
work
of
art
on
the
other
maybe
it
is
a
bit
too
much
for
me
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
cocoa
head
not
much
carbonation
or
lacing
on
this
beer
expected
with
the
high
abv
fairly
clear
in
appearance
somewhat
easy
to
see
through
the
nose
is
raisin
fig
caramel
hops
and
alcohol
a
little
bit
weak
on
the
nose
for
me
id
like
a
little
more
oomph
to
the
smell
taste
is
much
better
than
the
nose
the
same
profile
really
opens
up
here
very
balanced
and
enjoyable
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overpowering
at
15
feel
is
medium
with
a
nice
alcohol
burn
to
it
very
smooth
finish
as
well
a
little
syrupport
vibe
to
the
feel
too
overall
this
is
another
nice
beer
from
a
great
brewery
ive
been
waiting
since
spring
for
this
to
come
out
cheers
a
boozey
but
highly
tasty
brew
has
all
the
best
parts
of
english
style
barleywines
but
adds
a
very
subdued
hop
balance
to
keep
it
from
being
cloying
an
american
bw
for
english
bw
fans
a
real
sipper
though
due
to
the
strength
i
got
a
four
pack
of
these
and
will
thoroughly
enjoy
all
four
but
on
four
different
occasions
overall
a
fairly
intense
barleywine
with
a
complexity
of
flavors
that
work
well
together
definitely
a
sipper
and
a
cold
fall
night
a
really
good
one
at
that
overall
really
like
this
beer
its
the
first
barleywine
ive
ever
tried
i
thought
that
i
wouldnt
like
it
and
that
it
wouldnt
be
an
enjoyable
beer
for
me
given
the
high
alcohol
content
thats
not
the
case
i
like
the
complexity
of
the
beer
and
would
definitely
recommend
that
everyone
tries
it
do
drinkability
is
moderate
this
is
from
the
newest
batch
so
i
would
expect
it
to
be
a
little
hot
but
this
is
for
sure
a
sipper
in
its
current
state
the
flavors
are
big
but
the
alcohol
definitely
combats
that
to
turn
it
down
a
notch
i
bought
two
of
these
for
a
good
price
and
may
pick
up
another
few
and
stash
them
away
and
forget
about
them
i
can
see
this
turning
into
something
good
a
few
years
down
the
road
the
second
surprise
bottle
cracked
during
the
lastest
bliss
tasting
right
on
scott
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
sunrise
amber
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
dusty
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
buttery
toffee
alcohol
figs
raisins
other
dark
fruits
it
smells
just
as
vague
as
that
sounds
white
bread
light
menthol
and
honey
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
touch
of
minty
pine
running
down
the
back
possibly
the
result
of
the
booze
mixing
with
everything
else
on
my
tongue
the
alcohol
burn
is
a
bit
too
present
for
my
liking
here
the
body
is
a
heftyleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
decently
syrupy
feel
overall
a
pretty
okay
beast
of
a
bwine
but
the
booze
is
too
present
and
the
bold
flavors
never
truly
meld
all
that
well
together
close
though
this
is
a
beast
wow
one
of
those
extreme
beers
that
really
takes
the
words
out
of
your
mouth
poured
into
16
oz
snifter
pours
a
dark
orange
with
a
1
inch
tanish
red
sticky
head
smell
is
hard
candy
prunes
bready
as
hell
some
aged
grass
clippings
and
some
fin
booze
taste
all
that
with
a
blast
of
grapefruit
lemon
plenty
of
body
good
amount
of
life
for
the
high
abv
on
the
dryer
side
it
leaves
you
wondering
if
you
are
impressed
or
dumbfounded
probably
both
planning
on
drinking
this
batch
in
18
half
years
when
my
son
turns
21
a
unique
perplexing
beer
wouldnt
recommend
to
many
just
hard
core
beer
advocates
o
every
year
i
look
forward
to
this
offering
from
dfhevery
year
with
the
intention
of
laying
a
bit
down
for
some
aging
well
maybe
this
year
o
amazing
beer
for
15
simlar
to
samichlaus
and
not
quite
as
good
as
other
great
barleywines
out
there
o
great
winter
beer
its
so
complex
and
delicious
o
this
is
a
very
nice
barleywine
abv
is
not
over
the
top
as
i
expected
it
to
be
sweet
candy
like
flavors
are
melded
skillfully
and
provide
an
enjoyable
experience
recommended
small
sips
are
the
only
way
to
enjoy
this
beer
its
strong
and
you
can
it
warm
as
it
goes
down
im
glad
i
sat
on
it
a
while
but
i
wonder
if
it
would
have
been
any
better
fresh
the
hoppiness
would
have
been
better
im
sure
this
beer
pours
a
orangeish
color
with
a
12
a
finger
of
off
white
head
the
smell
is
piney
sweet
but
not
malty
sweet
with
a
boozey
finish
the
flavor
is
that
thick
sweetness
from
sugar
addition
the
hops
are
there
to
and
fairly
bitter
and
a
good
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
and
good
carb
and
hot
this
beer
is
pretty
good
could
deefnitely
use
some
age
d
a
sipper
to
say
the
least
this
one
packs
quite
the
punch
there
is
no
hiding
the
15
04
abv
each
sips
makes
you
open
your
eyes
a
bit
wide
i
dont
have
a
bad
thing
to
say
about
it
this
brew
is
a
case
study
in
complexity
this
is
really
good
stuff
nicely
done
by
sam
and
the
folks
as
dogfish
head
really
need
to
revisit
this
one
again
one
day
i
had
this
a
long
time
ago
when
i
was
first
getting
into
beers
i
doubt
that
i
fully
understood
what
i
had
in
my
glass
at
the
time
i
remember
the
beer
being
a
brownish
color
with
a
yellowish
white
head
that
had
a
light
sticky
lacing
the
sme
of
the
beer
was
monstrous
lots
of
malts
and
hops
mixed
with
booze
and
some
sweet
dark
fruits
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
also
way
over
the
top
for
me
at
the
time
it
was
malty
and
sweet
upfront
as
it
settled
into
my
tounge
it
left
a
tingling
sensation
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
had
a
really
thick
feeling
body
to
it
overall
the
beer
was
much
bigger
than
i
expected
its
been
a
while
like
i
said
and
i
really
need
to
have
this
one
again
i
think
o
a
good
barleywine
kinda
sweet
and
heavy
but
for
the
style
not
bad
at
all
overall
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
and
well
worth
trying
this
is
neither
good
nor
bad
this
can
be
certainly
enjoyed
by
many
but
there
are
many
better
options
out
there
o
this
is
a
damn
strong
beer
with
big
flavors
while
its
tasty
its
pretty
hard
to
drink
id
love
to
see
a
more
toned
down
version
set
a
few
of
these
aside
from
an
09
fourpack
that
i
bought
and
decided
to
break
one
out
tonight
despite
the
nc
heat
and
humidity
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
very
minimal
offwhite
head
aromas
is
sweet
dark
fruit
with
plums
raisins
dark
cherries
and
alcohol
dominating
the
nose
the
dark
fruits
continue
on
the
palate
but
are
joined
by
some
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
this
beer
is
very
sweet
and
syrupy
but
not
overly
cloying
it
goes
down
really
smooth
with
just
a
slight
alcohol
burn
im
not
sure
if
its
the
aging
that
has
taken
away
some
of
the
alcohol
burn
but
if
i
didnt
know
this
was
a
15
brew
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
it
maybe
not
my
favorite
american
barleywine
but
im
glad
i
set
a
few
of
these
aside
and
cant
wait
to
try
another
one
down
the
road
cheers
overall
a
very
nice
beer
good
tines
with
this
o
excellent
beer
barleywines
arent
my
favorite
style
and
as
a
huge
dogfish
fan
i
dont
even
really
care
for
olde
school
but
the
8years
of
age
on
this
beer
have
done
amazing
things
to
bring
out
new
complexity
to
both
the
flavor
and
smell
while
also
probably
destroying
the
head
retention
pours
a
crystal
clear
rubyamber
that
leaves
a
fingers
worth
of
cream
colored
head
oily
lacing
that
clings
momentarily
the
nose
is
different
to
say
the
least
im
sensing
an
almost
portlike
aroma
that
resembles
raisins
and
figs
a
stinging
amount
of
alcohol
infiltrates
my
nostrils
and
attacks
them
a
bit
harsh
the
taste
is
beastly
some
sweet
caramel
malts
are
matched
with
the
dark
fruit
characteristics
noted
in
the
nose
again
the
15
is
boldly
showing
itself
here
and
i
can
feel
it
on
my
lips
in
my
throat
and
belly
and
in
my
head
already
wow
this
ones
hot
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
smooth
and
fullbodied
overall
this
brew
offers
some
unusual
characteristics
but
is
quite
hot
and
could
use
some
more
time
down
in
the
cellar
it
lacks
drinkability
due
to
the
harsh
booze
effect
nonetheless
i
am
glad
i
got
to
bust
this
one
out
with
a
slightly
lower
carbonation
this
might
be
a
little
better
perhaps
sipped
like
a
good
bourbon
but
as
is
its
a
little
too
strong
for
my
tastes
dogfish
head
is
known
for
getting
a
little
crazy
and
extreme
olde
school
barleywine
is
definitely
that
its
extremely
crazy
sweet
its
pretty
good
stuff
but
i
wouldnt
really
start
here
if
youre
looking
to
explore
the
american
barleywine
style
its
at
the
far
end
of
the
big
bold
and
sweet
examples
of
the
style
ill
take
it
for
what
it
isan
extreme
novelty
but
its
one
thats
well
worth
checking
out
o
im
a
fan
of
the
big
dogfish
beers
120
minute
raison
dextra
fort
and
olde
school
all
have
this
very
sweet
raisin
profile
for
such
a
high
abv
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
it
helps
warm
up
the
palate
which
really
compliments
the
dark
and
burnt
flavors
this
is
isnt
even
a
year
old
and
it
drank
quite
well
i
think
i
may
have
liked
it
a
bit
more
when
it
was
fresh
back
around
december
but
i
cant
wait
to
try
one
with
a
few
years
on
it
just
an
extra
note
last
week
i
had
a
2007
fort
and
this
07
olde
school
gave
me
some
serious
de
javu
just
a
ton
of
faded
pureed
raspberries
off
o
after
a
few
sips
i
can
feel
some
booze
kicking
in
right
away
but
this
is
a
good
beer
im
not
a
fan
of
barleywines
but
this
was
in
the
beer
store
for
only
5
and
it
was
already
aged
again
this
is
a
2007
so
im
not
sure
how
this
compares
to
others
id
like
to
find
out
my
assumption
is
that
the
aging
really
helps
balance
out
the
flavors
im
sure
the
flavors
come
out
more
once
it
becomes
more
room
temperature
if
i
did
have
this
again
itd
be
a
special
occasion
or
just
something
to
sip
on
for
an
hour
or
2
because
of
the
buzz
in
the
end
i
would
recommend
people
to
try
this
i
dont
know
if
i
would
get
this
again
but
i
think
its
a
well
crafted
beer
and
i
do
enjoy
it
beautiful
red
mahogony
with
a
thin
offwhite
cap
leaving
nice
lacing
notes
of
booze
soaked
raisins
and
figs
bourbon
toffee
red
fruits
cinnamon
and
baking
spices
very
nice
taste
really
mirrors
the
nose
adding
bittersweet
chocolate
and
a
nice
touch
of
warming
booze
that
is
well
integrated
and
the
beer
is
also
beautifully
carbonated
for
the
style
a
well
rounded
complex
barleywine
that
i
look
forward
to
with
some
more
age
on
it
d
very
drinkable
nice
big
and
bold
barleywine
but
surprisingly
smooth
given
the
15
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
solid
beer
a
little
hot
in
the
alcohol
department
but
also
pretty
flavorful
and
tasty
the
caramely
malty
flavors
were
very
nice
in
it
and
gave
it
some
great
flavors
without
becoming
too
sweet
very
nice
beer
to
sip
on
this
evening
o
i
cant
believe
how
well
the
abv
is
hidden
even
when
i
drank
it
fresh
the
candied
fruits
really
work
well
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
t
great
beer
would
be
even
better
if
it
was
aged
a
bit
longer
i
like
it
and
would
highly
recommend
to
other
barley
wine
lovers
i
dont
recall
the
last
time
i
bought
this
beer
but
im
debating
getting
a
4
pack
and
having
2
bottles
around
23
years
old
and
the
other
2
maybe
78
years
old
the
start
of
this
bottle
made
me
think
the
beer
was
fading
away
the
second
pour
makes
me
feel
like
it
needs
a
good
bit
more
age
ive
never
experienced
this
though
i
normally
dont
open
with
such
a
small
pour
but
either
way
im
not
sure
what
would
have
happened
if
i
used
a
larger
glass
that
could
hold
the
whole
bottle
the
flavors
here
arent
overly
complex
but
they
contain
a
great
deal
of
nuance
and
subtlety
beneath
the
high
abv
much
like
immort
ale
from
dogfish
this
is
a
beer
to
age
before
even
considering
drinking
it
the
mouthfeel
is
super
sweet
and
cloying
unfortunately
a
bit
of
hops
would
help
balance
this
out
overall
a
really
good
beer
but
to
be
honest
i
enjoyed
this
beer
more
with
only
a
couple
years
of
age
on
it
compared
to
four
2004
bottle
thanks
doug
pours
a
peach
pink
color
with
a
lasting
white
cap
nose
is
abundantly
sweet
full
of
raisins
grapes
peaches
caramel
malt
flavor
is
dry
in
comparison
still
lots
of
fruit
sugars
especially
an
interesting
peach
quality
not
too
heavy
but
syrupy
enough
some
cardboard
oxidation
has
crept
in
after
seven
years
in
the
bottle
all
things
considered
this
is
probably
better
than
a
fresh
bottle
though
its
really
heavy
and
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
o
you
can
still
taste
the
burn
but
at
15
this
is
a
sneaky
barleywine
i
enjoyed
the
flavors
of
the
dried
fruits
and
the
subtle
sweetness
was
a
nice
touch
d
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
needs
another
2
years
probably
could
definitely
feel
the
15
i
usually
like
barleywines
but
this
one
makes
me
uneasy
about
aging
them
especially
at
such
a
high
abv
o
big
taste
on
this
one
but
definately
follow
directions
on
bottle
of
digging
a
hole
and
enjoy
a
year
later
after
everything
mellows
out
im
gonna
sit
on
the
other
one
for
a
while
overall
a
great
brew
very
complex
this
one
was
aged
6
months
and
was
superbly
smooth
for
a
brew
with
85
ibus
theres
probably
some
potential
with
this
one
and
i
have
a
couple
more
bottles
in
the
basement
but
even
if
this
develops
nicely
i
dont
feel
compelled
to
stock
up
on
any
more
some
interesting
flavors
going
on
and
it
really
does
have
a
brandylike
character
but
the
sugary
sweetness
is
just
a
little
overbalanced
for
my
taste
it
does
improve
as
it
warms
or
is
that
just
the
booze
talking
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
with
some
age
on
it
i
really
enjoyed
this
will
certainly
acquire
some
bottles
of
this
to
cellar
on
my
own
d
took
a
while
to
enjoy
this
with
the
high
amount
of
alcohol
to
it
got
much
better
as
it
warmed
too
enjoyable
drink
but
only
one
bottle
for
me
at
a
time
glad
to
try
this
though
strong
and
surprisingly
smooth
poured
orangebrown
with
some
white
head
that
disappeared
pretty
quickly
smells
of
sweet
malts
and
sugar
caramel
malts
in
the
taste
with
a
perusing
sweetness
and
alcohol
bite
some
dried
fruits
in
there
smooth
and
flavorful
mediumthick
mouthfeel
not
highly
drinkable
but
still
worth
a
swig
every
once
in
a
while
o
i
like
this
one
its
sweet
tart
and
has
some
nice
flavors
however
it
isnt
quite
as
complex
or
balanced
as
id
like
so
im
going
to
keep
trying
american
barleywines
i
have
to
put
this
beer
in
my
top
10
pours
a
rosy
orange
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
not
much
visible
carbonation
smell
is
of
sweet
fruit
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
taste
starts
slightly
bitter
when
it
first
hits
my
tongue
but
is
quickly
overtaken
by
a
mixture
of
sweet
fruit
tastes
i
think
i
catch
apple
and
raisin
mouthfeel
is
where
it
should
be
for
a
barleywine
overall
a
very
impressive
beer
hides
the
15
abv
very
well
its
missing
that
extra
note
but
it
feels
drinks
much
better
then
most
other
american
barleywines
in
my
opinion
in
short
barley
wine
shouldnt
taste
like
bitter
fruit
juice
mixed
with
hard
liquor
and
several
spoonfuls
of
sugar
actually
i
dont
think
anything
should
taste
like
this
theres
definitely
some
good
aspects
of
this
beer
but
i
dont
think
any
of
the
huge
problems
would
be
solved
by
aging
its
a
shame
because
the
finish
is
sometimes
really
nice
the
mouthfeel
excellent
the
ibu
decent
but
hard
to
appreciate
among
the
sugar
shock
assault
the
smell
full
and
complex
if
itself
too
hard
candy
for
me
overall
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
doesnt
regularly
steal
sugar
packets
from
coffee
shops
and
wash
them
down
with
vodka
original
score
c
im
finding
it
a
tough
one
to
sip
on
the
alcohol
is
pretty
much
in
my
face
and
i
still
cant
get
over
the
tart
element
that
old
horizontal
brings
to
the
table
as
always
im
most
appreciative
for
any
beer
i
get
the
chance
to
try
but
this
one
does
not
work
for
me
im
not
a
huge
barleywine
drinker
but
this
one
is
very
damn
tasty
indeed
no
surprise
that
its
dfh
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
oits
good
for
a
barleywine
im
not
really
a
barleywine
fan
and
this
beer
didnt
change
my
mindbut
it
was
close
its
a
good
barleywine
i
wish
i
liked
the
style
a
bit
more
overall
an
excellent
choice
overall
its
an
interesting
beer
but
not
really
something
i
would
seek
out
killing
a
750
of
this
might
prove
pretty
difficult
d
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
at
15
not
too
heavy
on
the
palate
which
was
surprising
ill
continue
to
buy
this
and
add
to
my
collection
i
much
prefer
an
aged
bottled
version
to
fresh
on
tap
overall
good
barleywine
would
perfer
it
a
little
mellower
o
really
amazing
to
see
what
8
years
can
do
to
a
beer
extremely
drinkable
even
at
15
no
real
alcohol
presence
on
the
flavor
profile
now
if
i
can
only
keep
the
few
bottles
i
have
from
2010
for
that
long
d
directions
from
the
bottle
say
to
split
between
two
snifters
i
would
agree
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
the
whole
think
and
still
want
to
drink
something
else
afterwards
the
cpj
drinkability
low
too
much
booze
for
my
tastes
i
am
intrigued
by
this
beer
the
nose
and
the
appearance
are
great
but
everything
else
just
feels
like
it
needs
to
incorporate
a
bit
more
this
sort
of
reminded
me
of
the
samaels
from
avery
but
better
alcohol
aromas
come
out
more
as
it
warms
as
does
maltlike
sweetness
in
the
flavor
wow
great
friggin
barleywine
this
is
i
am
not
so
sure
from
the
bottling
code
how
old
this
is
my
mind
wants
to
say
its
only
december
regardless
this
is
real
good
would
love
to
get
more
and
age
this
im
only
grading
this
on
the
09
since
the
05
is
a
pretty
big
downgrade
very
good
barleywine
id
be
interested
in
finding
the
sweet
spot
because
ill
bet
its
a
good
one
pours
an
opaque
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
12
inch
head
that
fades
to
an
oily
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
small
bubble
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
candied
fruit
apples
and
alcohol
taste
is
of
tart
apples
citrus
zest
maybe
some
raisinprune
flavors
very
alcohol
heavy
on
the
finish
burns
the
throat
after
each
sip
weird
cooked
vegetable
taste
too
beer
is
kind
of
thick
and
sticky
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
not
at
all
that
good
the
off
tastes
i
got
along
with
the
alcohol
burn
probably
shut
the
door
on
this
one
for
good
probably
would
be
better
with
some
age
on
it
this
was
a
very
good
barleywine
there
was
very
good
flavor
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
making
this
dangerously
easy
to
drink
i
like
it
under
the
right
circumstances
drinkability
honestly
not
as
bad
as
i
would
have
thought
for
being
so
young
of
a
beer
and
being
15
sure
there
is
a
slight
taste
of
alcohol
and
warming
but
again
for
being
15
this
beer
is
as
drinkable
as
you
could
imagine
a
15
fresh
beer
to
be
i
have
one
in
the
cellar
and
cant
wait
to
see
what
some
age
does
to
it
despite
being
one
dimensional
overall
not
a
bad
beer
wish
i
had
more
bottles
of
this
stuff
people
werent
joking
when
they
said
it
ages
spectacularly
well
done
heres
a
video
review
of
it
that
i
did
httpwww
youtube
comwatchvg4dcfbgbzmk
outstanding
but
the
high
alcohol
and
heaviness
of
this
limits
the
drinkability
as
well
as
restricting
it
to
only
one
no
more
than
two
im
not
going
to
lie
this
beer
is
pretty
stout
and
drinking
multiple
would
probably
be
a
problem
that
being
said
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
the
beer
is
appealing
and
with
perhaps
a
little
age
this
beer
could
be
phenomenal
bottom
line
i
like
this
beer
and
will
buy
again
good
beer
from
dogfish
winner
intoxicating
in
more
ways
than
two
what
faults
it
has
in
feel
i
think
are
more
than
made
up
with
the
flavor
a
little
over
the
top
allaround
but
dfh
isnt
a
modest
brewery
sip
slow
savor
d
definitely
a
sipper
but
pleasant
to
drink
drinkability
is
not
good
too
much
alcohol
on
the
end
and
almost
fusel
like
mouthdrink
medium
bodied
beer
incredibly
drinkable
for
a
15
barley
wine
poured
from
750ml
bottle
into
snifter
glass
pours
clear
dark
orange
with
a
thin
beige
head
aroma
of
brown
sugar
figs
a
touch
of
citrus
and
some
alcohol
full
body
and
fine
carbonation
boozy
taste
not
a
surprise
given
the
abv
and
youth
of
this
beer
this
beer
is
too
hot
to
be
particularly
enjoyable
the
bad
well
sorry
to
say
this
tastes
like
cough
syrup
to
me
ive
had
about
10
sips
now
and
it
just
isnt
getting
any
better
at
all
im
glad
i
only
bought
a
1
12
oz
bottle
because
unfortunately
im
going
to
have
to
dump
about
9
oz
of
it
down
the
drain
i
just
cant
go
any
further
into
this
beer
the
struggle
to
enjoy
is
unbearable
if
i
need
a
highalcohol
warm
winter
option
i
go
with
either
a
ris
or
a
port
wine
barley
wines
just
must
not
be
for
me
d
i
think
its
delicious
but
i
wouldnt
ever
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
the
feel
of
the
beer
is
full
bodied
a
big
barleywine
that
does
have
some
punch
then
is
softer
going
down
a
warming
blanket
like
feel
as
this
goes
down
gives
some
indication
as
to
how
high
the
abv
really
is
pours
a
very
hazy
orange
with
two
fingers
of
orangish
tan
head
smells
sweet
with
some
alcohol
caramel
malts
and
almost
an
orange
smell
taste
are
caramel
golden
raisins
sweet
malts
some
vanilla
and
a
drying
hopalcohol
finish
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
heavy
drinkability
is
really
high
for
a
beer
of
this
abv
my
fiancée
walked
by
picked
up
my
snifter
took
a
big
drink
and
said
wow
this
is
good
thats
how
drinkable
it
is
i
cant
believe
this
was
the
first
time
ive
ever
had
it
good
stuff
i
enjoy
this
one
fresh
and
aged
but
dont
buy
it
really
often
because
i
usually
prefer
my
barleywines
younger
with
some
more
hop
punch
this
one
is
good
fresh
but
a
bit
too
boozy
to
consume
often
overall
basically
a
5
for
1
beer
deal
d
4
5
a
delicious
beer
it
is
thick
chewy
and
maltforward
just
the
way
i
like
barleywines
to
be
it
is
definitely
of
the
english
type
a
little
too
sweet
and
mouth
coating
to
encourage
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
but
that
one
is
very
enjoyable
d
it
is
ok
not
my
kinda
barleywine
i
like
them
malty
but
still
a
really
nice
beer
dfh
olde
school
barleywine
has
a
dark
brown
colour
and
a
good
head
the
smell
is
of
strong
alcohol
with
a
hint
of
raisins
the
flavour
was
creamy
with
raisins
with
some
alcohol
warmth
it
was
very
nice
but
the
alcohol
was
too
noticeable
this
beer
had
a
very
creamy
texture
in
my
mouth
but
didnt
have
much
noticeable
carbonation
a
very
nice
and
strong
barleywine
i
was
expecting
this
to
have
a
hop
tastes
because
my
limited
exposure
to
barleywines
have
been
hoppy
however
it
dispelled
my
expectations
which
is
always
a
great
thing
that
being
said
its
extreme
alcohol
content
prevents
it
from
being
an
easily
quaffable
brew
d
very
high
aby
this
brew
will
sneak
up
on
you
olde
school
is
smooth
fruity
and
crisp
like
a
cider
or
an
enormous
malty
imperial
ipa
certainly
an
atypical
barleywine
and
one
of
dogfish
heads
most
palatable
big
beers
that
being
said
while
the
alcohol
is
masked
deceptively
well
especially
given
the
beers
freshness
you
cant
help
but
submit
to
its
will
i
felt
lightheaded
after
my
first
taste
which
makes
it
a
sipper
a
slow
slow
sipper
in
fact
its
probably
best
shared
with
some
age
on
this
id
expect
great
things
ive
got
one
cellared
and
am
anxious
to
revisit
this
brew
in
a
year
or
two
i
am
so
full
after
one
no
more
tdlr
get
this
beer
and
age
it
for
later
d
ill
tell
you
how
i
feel
when
i
finish
this
12oz
bottle
d
a
slow
sipper
makes
sense
at
15
very
good
beer
overall
overall
impression
although
the
vinous
character
of
olde
school
is
a
unique
take
on
a
barley
wine
im
not
sure
its
intentional
some
of
the
aromas
seem
a
bit
off
for
the
style
the
mild
sourness
is
unpleasant
to
me
and
the
evident
alcohol
detracts
from
the
beers
drinkability
on
the
u
s
bwine
spectrum
i
prefer
bolder
hoppier
and
smoother
examples
like
old
ruffian
100
and
old
crustacean
this
was
a
great
foray
into
the
world
of
barleywines
as
ive
not
yet
been
happy
with
my
previous
encounters
e
g
old
horizontal
olde
school
pours
a
bright
clear
amber
color
just
more
than
two
fingers
of
bone
colored
foam
crown
the
beer
retention
is
good
and
there
is
a
fair
bit
of
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
big
on
toffee
and
caramel
with
some
resinous
pine
hop
notes
providing
balance
theres
a
distinct
booziness
cutting
through
everything
though
and
giving
me
pause
yeah
everything
is
in
place
for
a
great
barleywine
rich
deep
malt
flavors
again
carameltoffee
are
the
main
offenders
almost
perfectly
offset
by
an
aggressive
hop
bite
the
bitterness
is
spot
on
but
i
could
have
stood
for
some
more
late
addition
hops
all
of
that
is
trampled
over
by
the
beers
abrasive
alcoholic
presence
as
one
might
expect
from
a
beer
with
such
a
malt
backbone
the
body
is
incredibly
rich
and
full
unfortunately
the
carbonation
isnt
quite
up
to
the
task
its
a
bit
too
subdued
the
result
is
a
definite
syrupy
quality
to
the
beer
ive
had
aged
olde
school
before
which
is
absolutely
sublime
unfortunately
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
pronounced
fresh
for
it
to
be
a
great
beer
d
excellent
especially
for
the
abv
while
its
hot
dogfish
has
yet
again
worked
the
booze
into
the
flavor
profile
as
opposed
to
letting
it
dominate
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
the
drinkability
suffers
at
the
hand
of
the
alcohol
taste
ill
have
to
get
some
to
age
though
because
it
definitely
has
potential
pour
into
a
pint
glass
the
pour
yields
a
creamwhite
head
that
seems
to
be
mellowing
down
amber
hue
minimal
visible
carbonation
and
pretty
damn
clear
this
has
the
aroma
of
a
good
american
barleywine
at
least
a
15
bw
smooth
warm
aromas
from
the
alcohol
fruit
and
candy
sugar
notes
from
the
malt
not
much
in
the
hop
department
on
this
one
for
such
a
strong
brew
the
alcohol
hides
pretty
well
also
notes
of
orange
zest
possibly
the
hops
i
was
looking
for
damn
this
is
sweet
alcohol
heat
and
a
strong
malt
bill
dominate
the
first
sip
the
alcohol
warm
closes
it
out
notes
of
orange
rinds
possibly
burnt
rinds
the
alcohol
heat
is
accompanied
by
some
spiced
flavors
this
beer
for
its
size
aint
too
shabby
it
does
a
good
job
of
hiding
15
better
than
some
beers
whose
alc
are
even
lower
than
15
aside
from
that
this
seems
to
come
off
as
an
english
style
barleywine
on
steroids
theres
nothing
american
about
this
beer
definitely
the
english
style
comes
to
mind
not
a
bad
thing
this
beers
main
feature
seems
to
be
masking
the
alcohol
aging
this
might
do
something
move
along
people
not
much
to
see
here
d
this
beer
is
a
good
interpretation
on
how
i
like
my
barleywines
it
had
some
good
sweetness
and
booze
but
not
overly
hoppy
it
drank
really
good
too
drink
this
think
snuck
up
on
me
after
a
brooklyn
1
and
a
dreadnaught
i
lost
a
couple
hours
the
other
night
very
nice
and
different
beer
mouthfeel
eh
hops
still
alcohol
clear
alcohol
feel
to
it
nothing
too
complex
develops
in
this
barleywine
it
leans
very
much
to
the
side
of
just
being
a
gigantic
ipa
and
hey
theres
a
time
and
place
for
that
hides
its
alcohol
a
lot
better
than
some
beers
half
its
strength
i
still
would
recommend
it
even
if
you
cant
wait
to
drink
it
how
many
15
beers
are
out
there
after
all
dm
drinks
a
bit
thick
incredible
depth
of
flavor
makes
it
enticing
to
drink
alcohol
sting
hurts
the
pallet
a
bit
but
ill
accept
the
sacrifice
slight
carbonation
tingle
d
big
stuff
got
to
have
it
bit
by
bit
there
is
no
hiding
the
alcohol
in
this
one
i
happen
to
like
a
lot
of
alcohol
heat
so
i
found
this
brew
to
be
tasty
however
a
stronger
hop
profile
would
go
a
long
way
suprisingly
easy
to
drink
for
as
huge
as
it
is
good
but
doesnt
have
the
complexity
or
depth
i
would
expect
in
a
barleywine
drinkability
goes
down
amazingly
at
first
as
it
gets
to
the
bottom
however
the
burn
increases
and
makes
for
a
tough
swallow
also
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
one
should
be
a
little
careful
with
how
many
you
drink
also
sugar
motherfs
d
nice
sipping
winter
beer
goes
slower
because
of
the
high
abv
d
such
a
great
barleywine
especially
considering
its
15
enjoy
this
one
but
share
with
a
friend
big
tasty
comforting
but
definitely
not
in
the
dangerously
drinkable
range
very
enjoyable
but
a
sipper
good
at
one
dthis
is
just
too
hot
right
now
got
a
4
pack
to
age
and
this
one
needs
to
sit
for
a
couple
years
at
least
would
love
to
get
some
older
versions
of
this
brew
pours
a
hazy
orangish
gold
with
a
small
head
nice
lacing
on
the
surface
smell
is
sweet
boozy
fruit
notes
taste
is
also
sweet
grainy
fruit
nice
citrusy
hops
in
the
finish
with
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
well
balanced
for
a
barley
wine
pretty
boozy
in
the
finish
nice
full
bodied
and
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
drinkable
for
the
strength
but
it
is
very
strong
overall
a
very
good
american
barley
wine
i
like
the
balance
and
the
warmth
from
this
and
also
just
a
very
nice
flavor
recommended
year
old
bottle
poured
into
my
new
snifter
the
beer
is
amber
honey
red
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dies
down
quickly
with
thing
lace
for
a
big
boozy
beer
this
one
looks
damn
good
boozy
rum
soaked
raisins
and
toffee
come
throughout
the
aroma
very
nicely
although
i
can
smell
the
alcohol
its
seems
to
meld
pretty
well
with
everything
else
on
this
the
taste
is
great
too
raisiny
and
fruity
with
a
nice
lingering
toffee
sweetness
to
round
it
out
the
alcohol
is
dangeriously
hidden
only
giving
a
slight
warming
sensation
in
the
throat
smooth
velvety
mouthfeel
with
damn
near
perfect
carbonation
for
a
booze
bomb
like
this
again
this
one
is
dangerous
goes
down
real
easy
a
bit
too
easy
for
a
fifteen
percent
beer
i
love
barleywine
have
received
awards
for
barleywine
and
brewing
barleywine

brews
and
im
a

fan
of
most
of

no

misses

like
from

sip
this
beast
with
care
slightly
disappointed
what
we
liked
most
about
this
brew
was
its
complexity
by
the
bottom
of
the
glass
thebrewodec

it
hides
it
well
significantly
too
sweet
to
be
truly
drinkable
but
a
solid
barleywine
nevertheless
jsprain1dec

and
a
sweet
cakelike
yeast
with
tannic
hints
taste
makes
barley
cider
come
to
mind
the
sweetness
and
grainy
malt
of
the
barley
come
through
but
a
little
too
alcoholic
and
too
sweet
would
like
to
try
again
but
with
age
on
it

and
im
excited
to
age

was

not

the
finish
consists
of
some
citrus
hop
and
malt
and
that
sweet
canteloupe
nectar
carbonation
is
low
most
likely
they
share
some
similarities
its
too
good
a
value
at
5
or
less
to
pass
up
some
beers
are
great
because
they
have
their
own
unique
flavor
thats
hard
to
describe
i
would
have
ordered
a
martini
very
strong
for
my
tastes
mouthfeel
was
very
good
and
lively
drinkability
to
me
was
low
due
to
the
hot
alcohol
flavor
and
smell
i
think
this
needs
some
cellaring
before
ill
try

im
no
longer
a
dogfish
fan
but
i
was
curious
about
the
barleywine
i
was
hoping
my
love
for
barleywine
would
trump
the
15
abv
but
it
was
not
to
be
this
was
a
turbid
orange
color
with
not
much
head
save
a
bubble
or
two
the
smell
was
like
citrus
cleaning
product
and
alcohol
the
taste
was
too
sweet
and
had
a
lasting
bitter
aftertaste
with
alcohol
warming
overall
this
was
a
very
extreme
beer
with
potent
alcohol
but
might
go
back
for
a
4
pack
to
cellar

the
sweetness

the
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
thick
but
not
syrupy
pillowy
but
not
fluffy
its
extremely
malty
and
the
alcohol
makes
its
presence
known
dominant
flavors
include
bananas
caramel
and
even
nutmeg
good
but
its
hard
to
see
drinking
this
often
this
has
aging
potential
but
i
dont
know
if
it
will
really
evolve
or
just
settle
down
old
guardian
hey
this
is
like
hittin
the
hard
stuff
smells
tastes
and
drinks
like
alcohol
and
good
for
what
ales
me
one
a
nite
is
plenty
a
good
one
to
finish
the
nite
though
with
some
aging
this
beer
will
shine
its
drinkable
young
and
you
should
definitely
sip
it
as
the
alcohol
can
and
will
sneak
up
on
you
while
not
the
best
example
out
there
its
definitely
one
of
the
better
examples
ive
had
i
bought
this
in
a
four
pack
recently
poured
into
a
chimay

typical
of
a
barley
wineleaving

of
raisins

figs
mouthfeel
is
ric
and
complexe
with
a
slight
kick
in
the
end
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
its
high
abv
this
type
of
beer
is
best
savored
slowly
and
on
a
cold
winters
night
kudos
to
dfh
the
heat
makes
it
not
too
drinkable
but
i
will
get
another
couple
to
let
them
rest
powerfully
potenthas
a
winelike
warmth
from
the
alcohol
while
it
is
predominantly
a
malt
brew
there
is
a
generous
amount
of
hops
to
give
it
some
balance
overall
i
think
with
some
aging
this
beer
could
be
really
good
i
dont
know
if
id
take
the
advice
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
of
throwing
it
into
the
ground
for
a
year
rapped
in
a
bag
i
definitely
this
age
would
help
lower
the
tones
of
the
alcohol
and
allow
for
the
flavor
to
become
more
prominent
very
sweet
but
astringent
flavor
with
some
cherry
and
citrus
notes
feels
thick
and
syrupy

really

might
revisit
an

will
bug
my

drinkability
is
ok
a
slow
sipper
based
on
the
abv
but
i
wouldnt
want
too
much
of
this
one
anyway
a
12
ozer
is
about
right
a
good
beer
but
i
think
bigfoot
and
legend
are
closer
to
my
taste
this
is
one
of
the
first
barleywines
i
have
ever
had
i
was
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
so
much
stronger
than
it
was
for
a
beer
that
is
15
it
hides
it
pretty
good
the
color
is
a
slightly
cloudy
mahogany
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
a
good
estery
nose
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
a
sour
hint
the
alcohol
feeling
is
warm
and
cuddly
i
couldnt
drink
more
then
1
or
2
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
another
good
effort
from
the
boys
in
delaware
d
to
be
a
huge
beer
its
not
that
hard
to
drink
alcohol
is
evident
but
not
quite
over
the
top
and
luckily
the
bitterness
is
kept
at
a
minimum
lighter
body
also
equals
higher
drinkability
however
barleywines
arent
meant
for
chugging
and
though
its
a
valiant
attempt
dfh
should
know
how
to
craft
a
better
barleywine
than
this
overall
im
very
pleased
im
going
to
buy
a
bunch
of
this
and
hide
it
form
myself
to
see
how
it
does
with
a
bit
of
time
3
5
d
i
dont
know
why
they
sell
these
in
bombers
i
got
bottles
and
one
of
them
is
more
than
plenty
couldnt
imagine
another
10
ounces
of
this
stuff
quality
brew
though
d
this
one
is
still
really
heavy
with
alc
other
dfhs
with
as
much
alc
like
wws
or
120
do
a
better
balance
job
in
hiding
the
alc
but
this
one
is
still
present
have
another
bottle
from
06
vintage
check
it
next
year
the
flavor
starts
off
with
sweet
caramelized
malts
and
spicy
hops
but
after
that
its
all
alcohol
every
fluid
ounce
of
ethanol
is
tasted
in
this
fresh
beastly
barleywine
fusels
mix
with
boozy
rum
and
sherrysoaked
dark
fruits
to
deliver
an
intense
if
not
slightly
offputting
taste
body
is
hot
with
booze
and
on
the
thickerovercarbonated
side
of
things
still
you
can
taste
the
craftsmanship
in
this
one
olde
school
isnt
the
most
sippableand
certainly
not
the
most
sessionablebarleywine
out
there
but
im
excited
to
see
how
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
will
cool
out
the
hot
alcohol
presence
i
will
definitely
update
this
review
at
the
appropriate
time
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
alcohol
but
contains
hints
of
malts
and
dark
fruit
sweet
and
syruplike
up
front
followed
by
a
strong
alcohol
warmth
and
a
burning
in
your
stomach
not
as
hoppy
as
i
would
like
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
alcohol
flavor
is
so
prevelant
that
it
overpowers
most
of
the
other
flavors
not
a
big
fan
taste
is
warm
and
alcoholic
there
is
an
earthy
sensation
that
is
probably
the
dates
and
figs
drinkability
tends
to
get
better
every
sip
and
although
this
is
a
high
alcoholic
beer
it
drinks
relatively
easy
malt
is
sweet
and
a
bit
caramellic
and
biscuity
a
very
hearty
barleywine
that
i
think
has
aged
gracefully
and
thats
good
drinkability
whew
yeah
15
04
that
was
measured
with
a
machine
eh
is
a
little
high
even
for
a
barleywine
and
it
showed
here
the
alcohol
on
this
one
burned
harshly
but
there
is
plenty
of
good
stuff
here
too
a
hugely
complex
malt
profile
plenty
of
interesting
hoppy
notes
and
its
not
nearly
as
bad
in
many
places
as
it
probably
should
have
been
give
this
one
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
its
probably
not
gonna
become
a
goto
lawnmower
beer
for
you
and
if
so
id
like
to
shake
your
hand
but
its
an
interesting
one
now
i
understand
i
am
being
biased
in
this
review
but
it
still
is
an
amazing
brew
that
was
concocted
here
drinks
easy
but
the
complexity
abv
will
get
to
you
damn
fine
barley
wine
not
a
fan
of
the
overly
sweet
character
here
still
a
great
achievment
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
is
a
nice
bold
barleywine
from
dogfish
head
clear
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
and
a
little
lacing
which
was
nice
considering
the
high
abv
sweet
caramel
toffee
and
fig
flavors
with
a
rush
of
alcohol
sugars
and
spicy
hops
finishing
it
off
very
warming
with
some
alcohol
burn
at
15
abv
i
expect
it
to
be
hot
and
it
is
but
not
over
the
top
not
nearly
as
hoppy
as
i
thought
it
might
be
perhaps
the
hot
alcohols
mask
that
a
little
nicely
done
a
relaxing
sipper
and
i
have
little
doubt
that
this
would
get
even
better
with
some
aging
and
it
has
mellowed
a
bit
now
i
get
the
two
snifter
thing
i
needed
a
short
break
after
the
first
second
at
what
became
solid
room
temp
was
pretty
much
the
same
a
slight
more
appleish
perhaps
a
slight
tad
fulller
ready
for
a
good
nights
sleep
after
this
one
as
far
as
barleywines
go
well
nice
but
cant
say
one
of
my
favorites
drinkability
is
actually
quite
good
but
i
wouldnt
dare
take
this
beers
strength
for
granted
a
great
sipper
drinkability
wish
i
had
tried
this
last
year
as
is
its
still
a
very
good
barleywine
after
4
12
years
on
the
shelf
pours
a
orangish
pink
in
color
with
no
head
forming
at
all
smell
is
malty
and
still
showing
signs
of
the
big
alcohol
level
taste
is
showing
more
of
the
alcohol
than
was
in
the
nose
there
are
also
some
light
citrusy
fruit
and
white
wine
qualities
it
still
needs
some
time
in
the
cellar
just
dont
know
if
the
alcohol
will
ever
diminish
from
this
level
still
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
d
what
can
you
say
about
a
15
barleywine
find
a
friend
or
lover
and
share
this
over
an
hour
or
two
d
complex
with
a
good
mouthfeel
enjoyable
big
props
for
having
such
a
high
percentage
brew
that
warms
so
well
my
first
barleywine
12oz
bottle
poured
into
my
leffe
goblet
the
smell
is
sweet
and
fruity
the
taste
is
sweet
raisons
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
creamy
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
still
very
good
reminds
me
of
dfh
raison
d
etre
but
i
enjoyed
this
brew
much
better
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
enough
considering
its
15
abv
but
still
a
bit
over
the
top
for
me
dfantastic
sublte
hint
of
port
with
big
fruity
raisons
very
smooth
for
such
a
different
take
on
the
style
my
father
had
a
15
year
old
port
with
his
cigar
and
he
kept
asking
me
for
a
sip
of
this
so
just
keep
that
in
mind
very
slow
drinking
more
fruit
oriented
in
flavors
and
aroma
compared
to
most
barleywines
md
medium
to
full
body
the
mouthfeel
was
actuauly
quite
nice
and
creamy
the
drinkability
on
the
other
hand
was
not
at
15
abv
very
strong
too
strong
not
a
good
example
of
an
american
bw
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
will
not
be
searching
for
this
again
skal
drinkability
is
surprisingly
high
i
thought
i
was
in
for
a
2
hr
sipper
but
his
sucker
is
going
down
with
dangerous
speed
i
assume
the
6
months
i
sat
on
this
really
helped
and
im
glad
ive
got
a
few
more
left
as
this
one
is
a
winner
probably
my
favorite
of
the
big
as
dfh
brews
to
date
still
its
worth
noting
that
i
find
them
all
to
taste
very
similar
well
im
thinking
of
the
120
and
raison
dextra
dominated
by
the
esters
and
sweet
malt
and
sugars
while
this
is
a
tasty
enjoyable
beer
in
its
own
right
much
of
my
score
reflects
how
well
executed
this
is
as
i
homebrewer
i
know
making
these
monster
beers
is
no
easy
task
much
more
of
an
english
bw
in
my
mind
thanks
to
cwiggins
for
the
bottle
it
was
worth
a
try
a
decent
barleywine
and
another
nice
selection
from
dogfish
head
d
very
easy
to
drink
reminds
me
almost
of
samichlaus
but
with
more
bite
i
enjoy
this
very
much
07
bottle
no
head
once
poured
buttery
upfront
aroma
of
caramel
and
some
fruitiness
sweet
and
warming
alcohol
with
little
bitterness
in
the
taste
ok
barlywine
i
wiill
save
the
others
for
years
to
come
just
cause
it
isnt
quite
there
i
will
still
try
this
beer
every
year
when
it
releases
the
body
is
big
no
kidding
and
high
perception
of
alcohol
carbonation
is
limited
but
understandable
with
the
abv
that
is
a
bit
of
a
deterrent
though
i
rate
this
based
off
of
this
years
i
have
had
olde
school
after
a
year
and
though
improves
this
beer
could
use
more
time
drinkability
is
decent
this
is
defenitely
a
sipping
brew
but
the
flavors
and
concentration
here
make
it
a
rich
and
tasty
one
and
besides
the
cowboy
on
the
bottle
will
do
you
no
wrong
he
just
wants
you
to
enjoy
the
brew
cheers
md
full
bodied
low
carbonation
alcohol
is
there
but
not
huge
drinkability
well
its
a
sipper
no
doubt
but
much
more
drinkable
then
i
thought
it
would
be
as
is
not
terribly
drinkable
im
glad
i
split
this
bottle
four
ways
this
is
an
american
barleywine
on
steroids
made
to
drink
slow
and
savor
would
have
been
better
with
the
alcohol
pulled
back
a
bit
still
one
to
try
just
for
the
experience
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
yielding
a
small
light
brown
head
that
quickly
fades
dark
rich
amber
color
that
was
clear
and
had
lots
of
carbonation
present
scents
of
sweet
figs
and
lots
of
alcohol
taste
bud
overload
with
the
first
sip
detected
sweet
grapes
raisons
light
molasses
all
the
while
carbonation
tickles
the
tongue
thick
syrupy
texture
that
leaves
a
lasting
taste
in
the
mouth
simply
delicious
and
with
a
high
abv
i
could
drink
myself
into
a
coma
with
this
one
poured
this
into
my
duvel
glass
has
a
deep
orange
color
and
a
nice
one
inch
beige
head
that
slowly
settles
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
wow
this
smells
really
boozy
i
can
smell
a
little
bit
of
raisin
and
some
sweet
fruit
and
caramel
but
mainly
just
booze
the
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
a
little
bit
of
honey
and
some
sweet
fruit
and
then
the
alcohol
and
strong
sweet
taste
hits
and
leaves
with
a
slightly
bitter
after
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
the
drinkability
takes
a
big
hit
for
the
15
abv
and
the
strong
alcohol
taste
i
had
this
around
early
january
and
decided
to
let
it
age
some
but
this
did
not
make
much
of
a
difference
overall
a
pretty
sweet
boozy
barleywine
that
should
definitely
be
shared
drinkability
a
true
sip
and
savor
brew
theres
a
long
and
lingering
finish
drinkability
no
thanks
perhaps
this
one
does
temper
a
bit
after
being
buried
alive
but
as
it
stands
now
i
just
didnt
care
for
it
12
ounce
bottle
bottled
on
101707
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberorangered
color
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
is
average
lacing
is
good
the
alcohol
is
very
noticable
in
the
aroma
it
also
smells
like
raisins
caramel
and
citrusy
hops
but
its
overall
a
sweet
smelling
brew
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
spice
and
plums
i
can
taste
just
like
the
aroma
its
a
sweetboozy
tasting
beer
and
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
creamy
rich
and
syrupy
drinkability
is
good
enough
its
definitely
a
sipper
but
the
alcohol
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
a
bit
this
one
could
have
used
some
more
aging
but
all
in
all
i
thought
the
olde
school
barleywine
is
a
good
beer
definitely
recommended
poured
into
a
snifter
this
was
an
old
burnished
penny
color
with
good
clarity
and
no
sediment
small
quickly
diminishing
offwhite
head
it
had
legs
like
a
fortified
wine
and
just
little
spots
of
lacing
looks
thick
nose
greets
you
with
prominent
alcoholwhiskey
also
soft
honeyed
malts
dried
fruit
toffee
and
sourish
notes
underneath
taste
is
big
thick
sweet
malt
with
alcohol
and
some
spice
providing
some
balance
huge
bodied
viscous
and
very
lightly
carbonated
big
warming
alcohol
on
the
way
down
this
is
an
afterdinner
sipper
much
like
a
tawny
port
madiera
brandy
or
armagnac
would
be
a
great
match
with
a
nice
smooth
cigar
olde
school
barleywine
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
fairly
light
for
a
barleywine
right
off
the
bat
even
as
i
open
the
bottle
i
smell
fruity
esters
and
an
odd
damp
yeasty
aroma
there
is
also
some
citrusy
hops
and
plenty
of
hints
of
the
alcohol
to
come
sharp
and
spicy
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
sharp
almost
sour
nice
and
bitter
there
is
a
kind
of
a
caramely
sweetness
but
at
this
abv
it
could
easily
be
from
the
tons
of
pale
malt
in
the
beer
the
hop
flavor
is
there
but
subdued
and
a
bitter
chocolatey
flavor
comes
through
in
the
finish
considering
the
alcohol
content
the
alcohol
flavor
is
well
masked
but
at
15
its
pretty
hard
to
hide
and
its
definitely
there
i
would
love
to
see
this
beer
in
a
year
or
two
as
dfh
suggests
to
see
if
it
mellows
out
a
bit
drinkability
i
could
easily
get
schooled
ha
ha
ha
drinking
olde
school
for
a
barley
wine
this
is
pretty
good
i
would
recommend
aging
for
at
least
6
months
if
you
can
wait
dogfish
certainly
makes
better
brews
than
this
but
if
youre
into
dominating
barleywines
this
one
is
for
you
d
definitely
a
sipper
for
sure
i
dont
generally
find
barleywines
to
be
very
drinkable
but
i
get
in
the
mood
for
one
every
once
in
a
while
this
is
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
plum
and
raison
dark
fruitiness
in
the
taste
dark
fruits
primarily
raison
and
actually
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
a
bitter
sticky
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
sticky
plum
aftertaste
a
very
nice
hop
presence
and
actually
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
d
it
has
a
whole
lot
of
abv
and
could
benefit
from
aging
but
for
such
a
alcohol
monster
it
was
surprisingly
smooth
and
finished
clean
d
wow
this
could
be
very
troublesome
to
drink
not
realizing
just
how
strong
it
really
is
drinkability
is
very
good
along
with
flavor
a
strong
barelywine
that
drinks
sweet
and
a
definite
recommend
for
fans
of
style
got
this
one
at
the
dfh
alehouse
pours
a
deep
reddish
color
with
some
light
offwhite
foam
on
top
that
quickly
dissolved
down
syrupy
looking
nose
is
caramel
sweetness
grapes
and
some
alcohol
in
the
background
taste
is
similar
dates
and
sweet
fruitiness
alcohol
comes
through
fairly
strong
later
on
warming
booze
body
is
syrupy
but
actually
a
little
thin
overall
quite
tasty
the
alcohol
is
a
little
strong
but
doesnt
really
detract
that
much
from
the
flavor
this
one
is
tasty
but
its
also
overwhelmingly
bitter
and
the
alcohol
is
pretty
strong
this
would
probably
make
a
good
desert
beer
after
a
big
meal
but
otherwise
its
pretty
heavy
recommended
as
the
only
beer
you
drink
in
a
night
2006
and
2007
tasted
side
by
side
both
poured
a
crisp
dark
orange
with
a
thin
head
that
diminished
to
a
ring
aroma
is
more
profound
from
the
07
glass
both
have
burnt
caramel
and
subtle
hops
but
the
07
is
more
abundant
the
07
has
a
much
more
cloying
sweetness
that
is
toned
down
in
the
06
dried
fruits
sweet
apples
and
some
caramel
flavor
dominate
the
taste
in
both
the
beer
is
certainly
heavy
with
lots
of
syrupy
alcohol
while
there
are
many
better
barley
wines
out
there
this
one
does
stand
out
with
the
15
abv
and
unique
dfh
touch
to
it
it
is
certainly
a
sipper
however
taste
is
very
much
like
the
smell
malt
sweetness
takes
the
forefront
here
though
mouthfeel
verges
on
full
but
without
the
dark
malts
of
a
stout
it
almost
seems
a
little
syrupy
almost
still
very
good
the
alcohol
in
this
one
would
keep
me
from
grabbing
another
tonight
but
i
would
love
to
drink
this
again
glad
i
got
two
more
to
cellar
this
one
definitely
packs
a
punch
to
it
pours
a
red
to
orange
with
a
little
haze
little
to
no
head
on
this
beer
dissipates
almost
immediately
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
to
this
one
smell
is
overpowering
lots
of
alcohol
with
lots
of
spice
overpower
the
nose
taste
is
traditional
barleywine
but
has
the
alcohol
right
up
front
very
strong
finishes
with
sweet
and
fruity
accents
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thick
a
little
syrupy
drinkability
is
not
all
there
probably
because
of
the
15
abv
and
the
heaviness
a
couple
will
set
you
good
though
definitely
worth
the
pickup
and
a
must
for
dogfish
fans
this
beer
is
truly
epic
i
believe
the
term
bonecrusher
is
used
to
describe
it
on
dogfish
heads
website
and
it
couldnt
be
any
further
from
the
truth
it
poured
a
deep
copper
red
into
my
favorite
snifter
there
wasnt
much
of
a
head
and
little
lacing
the
nose
is
very
shard
with
hints
of
dates
raisins
and
honey
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
almost
like
gulden
draak
i
will
definitely
be
cellaring
the
rest
of
this
case
for
further
enjoyment
this
has
been
consistently
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
ever
if
you
like
a
lesshopped
barleywine
then
this
one
is
for
you
there
are
alot
of
wine
characteristics
here
and
its
just
a
very
smooth
experience
top
notch
cheers
pours
a
really
gorgeous
ruby
and
caramel
color
with
plentiful
open
bubbled
head
probably
the
nicest
looking
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
good
tracing
in
the
glass
and
from
a
half
bottle
pour
very
clear
aromas
are
just
awash
in
raisins
prunes
candy
sugar
lightly
toasted
malts
and
an
overall
sense
that
yes
this
is
15
abv
some
slight
citrus
and
herbal
notes
from
the
hops
as
well
on
the
palate
it
is
slick
sweet
and
something
to
really
sip
and
think
about
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
120
min
except
maltier
and
slightly
toastier
i
understand
the
difficulty
of
brewing
a
drinkable
beer
that
is
an
excess
of
11
and
that
it
will
be
exceptionally
sweet
that
being
said
if
it
was
classified
as
an
old
ale
i
really
enjoy
it
no
its
not
balanced
but
quite
a
fine
sipper
while
raison
dextra
i
didnt
care
for
as
much
this
is
another
great
boundary
pushing
beer
by
dfh
d
even
after
a
year
this
is
still
just
too
hot
there
have
been
some
remarkable
improvements
so
far
though
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
some
more
time
in
the
cellar
yields
my
other
three
bottles
are
destined
for
future
greatness
defintiely
worth
seeking
out
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
barleywine
but
with
an
intensity
like
this
it
might
be
advisable
to
warm
your
palate
with
another
beer
first
to
fully
enjoy
this
the
alcohol
baffles
me
ive
had
stronger
beers
than
this
dogfish
120
ipa
worldwide
stout
raison
dextra
but
they
dont
go
to
my
head
like
this
one
one
of
the
worst
mistakes
of
my
life
occurred
on
the
evening
when
i
decided
to
drink
two
12oz
bottles
of
this
beer
i
awoke
at
3am
with
my
head
spinning
and
feeling
quite
nauseous
ill
never
do
that
again
d
this
is
a
really
interesting
drink
i
find
it
hard
to
compare
to
other
american
barley
wines
which
is
how
it
is
categorized
as
i
write
this
review
i
would
really
compare
it
more
to
a
j
w
lees
english
barley
wine
though
that
is
an
imperfect
comparison
too
because
they
are
not
really
alike
i
am
just
trying
to
categorize
it
and
as
with
many
dfh
offerings
it
is
a
hard
thing
to
do
it
would
make
a
great
after
dinner
drink
maybe
also
an
aperitif
possibly
a
great
drink
with
dinner
but
i
am
not
sure
of
the
right
course
d
a
decent
beer
but
quite
difficult
to
drink
this
one
is
way
too
hot
right
now
of
my
taste
but
then
again
this
is
probably
a
young
bottle
if
the
alcohol
mellows
a
bit
with
some
age
this
good
be
a
very
good
brew
this
was
a
good
barleywine
and
i
would
recommend
it
d
another
winner
from
dogfish
head
this
would
make
a
great
after
dinner
drink
d
wellbalanced
and
surprisingly
light
and
fruity
for
this
style
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
at
15
this
is
a
very
pleasant
sipping
beer
for
the
eveningafter
dinner
pours
a
fully
clouded
dark
brownish
orange
nose
is
almost
candylike
definite
peach
tones
there
flavor
is
extremely
sweet
mild
noticeable
alcohol
seems
way
too
tight
to
pull
any
thick
or
noticeable
characteristics
off
of
it
feel
is
good
on
the
liquid
and
the
carbonation
is
good
as
well
this
is
drinking
fairly
nice
now
but
it
could
use
a
lot
more
time
to
mellow
down
d
for
a
15
abv
beer
this
is
spectacularly
drinkable
it
uses
its
alcoholic
strength
to
compliment
the
hops
and
yeast
spice
in
a
way
that
is
pleasantly
reminiscent
of
the
sam
adams
imperial
pils
the
juicy
fruit
presence
was
very
surprising
and
quite
nice
i
must
say
that
this
is
a
very
welcome
180
reversal
from
their
dismal
immort
ale
the
beer
had
a
deep
amber
body
with
an
off
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
film
across
the
top
very
little
carbonation
present
in
the
body
the
smell
was
largely
of
sweet
juicy
fruit
with
a
slight
american
hops
notes
also
present
was
large
alcoholic
notes
the
taste
was
very
similar
to
the
smell
juicy
and
chewy
malts
with
hops
appearing
at
the
end
of
the
taste
this
was
a
sipping
beer
that
i
saved
a
couple
and
i
am
going
to
lay
them
down
and
see
how
they
age
expensive
good
and
extremely
potent
ill
be
buying
a
few
more
for
the
cellar
and
as
occasional
latenight
treats
drinkability
is
fantastic
here
just
watch
how
you
down
this
and
it
will
treat
you
right
great
sipper
i
continue
to
be
impressed
by
the
whole
dogfish
head
line
of
ales
this
olde
school
barleywine
poured
a
nice
orangeamber
color
with
very
little
head
though
there
was
a
constant
carbonation
release
throughout
the
time
i
savored
this
ale
and
like
all
barleywines
this
one
must
be
savored
slowly
the
nose
is
pleasant
enough
but
there
is
quite
a
lot
of
alcohol
smell
as
is
to
be
expected
the
taste
is
where
this
ale
shines
it
is
sweet
followed
by
a
pleasant
alcohol
bite
and
finishes
with
a
surprise
hint
of
faint
citrus
and
toast
highly
recommended
certainly
worth
it
as
a
nice
lateevening
winddown
with
a
good
book
at
bedtime
ill
certainly
sleep
well
tonight
i
gotta
believe
that
this
one
will
age
like
a
champ
of
the
four
pack
im
going
to
save
the
other
three
ok
maybe
just
two
of
them
to
see
how
it
goes
ill
get
back
to
you
on
this
in
three
years
um
what
im
just
going
to
review
this
as
an
english
barleywine
eh
cause
well
like
what
who
put
this
under
merican
anyway
it
has
the
characteristic
underattenuation
of
the
english
style
coupled
with
low
bitterness
and
a
high
amount
of
fruit
funk
to
it
the
wife
says
ew
whats
that
weird
taste
i
thought
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
barleywine
it
was
absofrickinglutely
stunning
blended
with
the
southern
tier
dipa
but
hey
thats
life
weird
how
two
underattenuated
beers
would
not
taste
that
way
at
all
when
mixed
drinkability
ill
try
to
let
the
remaining
3
beers
from
the
4pack
age
for
a
while
and
try
again
but
i
dont
know
if
i
can
let
this
hang
out
in
my
beer
fridge
that
long
this
is
good
stuff
like
ive
come
to
expect
from
dogfish
head
definately
a
sipper
but
you
knew
that
a
decent
barleywine
but
not
the
best
d
way
too
hot
for
more
than
a
one
beer
sipper
got
2
more
to
lay
down
will
see
what
12or
10
years
does
pours
a
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
a
fairly
lively
head
sweetsour
aroma
theres
some
fruitiness
in
the
taste
but
the
taste
is
dominated
by
a
cloying
sweetness
alcohol
is
very
noticeable
and
gives
this
a
boozy
quality
i
really
didnt
like
this
beer
its
far
too
sweet
imho
i
put
the
remaining
bottles
aside
to
age
for
a
year
or
more
hopefully
it
will
improve
with
age
at
13
99
a
4
pack
this
isnt
a
cheap
beer
and
i
expected
a
lot
more
from
it
snifters
filled
with
a
cloudy
dark
redamber
the
thin
tan
offwhite
head
slowly
falls
leaving
surprising
lacing
given
the
abv
sticks
to
the
glass
like
syrup
the
nose
is
incredibly
sweet
with
massive
doses
of
sugary
malts
raisin
prunes
the
smell
is
full
and
almost
sticky
the
high
alcohol
content
is
very
well
masked
with
no
astringent
notes
the
taste
matches
up
to
the
nose
again
very
very
sweet
and
rich
with
the
same
sugary
sweetness
and
raisin
flavor
the
bittering
is
quite
low
the
alcohol
warming
is
much
lower
than
i
was
expecting
with
only
a
light
alcoholic
bite
and
minimal
astringency
its
very
well
hidden
for
15
per
cent
the
aftertaste
is
full
syrupy
sweet
and
full
of
raisin
flavors
this
is
a
big
beer
definitely
invites
sipping
from
a
snifter
like
a
cognac
really
no
other
way
to
drink
it
it
is
drinkable
given
how
well
hidden
the
high
alcohol
is
and
how
flavorful
it
is
it
would
make
a
very
nice
desert
but
not
a
chance
of
drinking
multiple
bottles
orangish
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
that
quickly
dissapates
a
nose
of
citrus
hops
sweet
malts
and
ripe
fruits
there
are
also
growing
ester
tones
as
it
warms
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
the
alcohol
quite
noticeable
ripe
fruits
caramel
and
a
big
sweet
maltiness
i
cannot
find
the
hop
presence
that
was
in
the
nose
a
syrupy
full
body
and
low
carbonation
not
the
greatest
mouthfeel
or
drinkability
i
feel
it
needs
more
hops
or
another
strong
flavor
besides
the
sweet
malts
to
help
balance
it
out
i
am
a
fan
of
dogfish
heads
experimental
brews
just
not
this
one
it
has
potential
but
is
just
not
quite
there
i
am
curious
to
see
what
a
few
years
of
hibernation
will
do
to
this
overall
this
a
tasty
beer
but
has
several
flaws
imo
not
your
typical
barleywine
but
then
again
what
dfh
brew
is
typical
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
the
wine
gallery
in
brookline
ma
a
cloudy
amber
with
hints
of
orange
small
amount
of
head
that
goes
away
pretty
quickly
some
lacing
s
caramel
citrus
dark
fruits
alcohol
is
present
t
much
more
tart
than
i
expected
very
different
from
a
regular
barleywine
its
got
a
lot
of
citrus
notes
the
hops
are
a
bit
muted
some
grassy
earthiness
toward
the
finish
m
very
thick
chewy
and
smooth
d
like
i
said
its
a
really
unique
barleywineit
almost
tastes
more
like
an
imperial
pale
ale
but
its
really
tasty
ive
loved
so
much
of
the
dogfish
offerings
that
i
almost
expected
this
to
have
a
bit
more
to
say
but
its
still
great
overall
as
a
barleywine
this
ones
not
outstanding
as
a
beer
however
its
definitely
head
and
shoulders
above
many
if
not
most
others
someone
said
its
like
barleywine
meets
apa
and
here
i
tend
to
agree
there
are
definite
similarities
between
this
and
others
of
dfhs
american
pales
still
and
all
this
ones
worthwhile
recommended
i
have
been
a
huge
dfh
fan
since
i
first
discovered
them
but
this
is
not
one
of
thier
better
beers
i
enjoy
a
good
barleywine
and
this
one
is
average
at
best
i
dont
want
to
jump
out
too
much
here
because
a
beer
of
15
can
improve
over
time
at
which
case
ill
try
it
again
and
give
it
another
review
will
try
another
store
to
see
if
i
bought
the
only
flat
4
pack
in
az
if
that
one
is
flat
then
i
will
be
ready
to
try
one
in
about
a
year
pours
a
ruby
colored
copper
with
an
off
white
head
that
soon
settles
to
a
fine
lacing
great
aroma
of
alcohol
sugars
ripened
fruit
and
alcohol
taste
is
of
ripe
dark
fruit
figs
prunes
etc
and
a
husky
malt
background
alcohol
sugars
are
the
story
here
medium
full
mouthfeel
with
a
definite
alcohol
warming
as
it
hits
the
gut
alcohol
is
relatively
well
hidden
considering
the
abv
if
anything
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
in
barley
wine
ill
bet
an
aged
bottle
is
tamed
down
a
bit
still
a
solid
brew
that
is
worth
trying
cheers
overall
another
wonderful
beer
by
dfh
i
love
the
big
aggressive
brews
they
put
out
and
this
one
is
exactly
what
i
thought
it
would
be
big
on
flavor
and
big
on
abv
i
did
not
taste
the
alcohol
but
believe
me
i
did
feel
it
i
have
another
one
to
enjoy
now
and
two
more
to
age
i
will
love
trying
the
two
that
i
cellar
on
its
first
and
second
birthday
drinkability
thickness
and
abv
hurt
here
but
the
taste
saves
it
delicious
beer
whose
drinkability
is
is
quite
high
very
good
beer
another
must
buy
from
dogfish
head
an
interesting
take
on
a
barleywine
i
liked
the
fruity
flavors
and
the
alcohol
really
didnt
get
in
the
way
as
much
as
i
thought
it
would
still
i
cant
really
say
that
theres
anything
to
get
particularly
excited
about
here
its
a
good
beer
but
not
one
that
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
well
worth
a
try
though
recommended
it
was
with
some
trepidation
that
i
tried
this
beer
the
15
abv
was
a
bit
intimidating
as
was
the
advice
on
the
label
of
the
12oz
bottle
to
pour
it
into
two
snifters
and
enjoy
nevertheless
i
soldiered
on
the
beer
was
a
redorange
color
with
virtually
no
head
it
had
a
predominately
fruity
aroma
banana
and
raisin
a
little
caramel
robust
taste
the
alcohol
was
noticeable
without
being
intrusive
and
quite
warming
i
found
it
to
be
quite
drinkable
as
long
as
its
6
to
12
ounces
at
a
time
d
yeah
its
15
and
still
a
tad
hot
i
would
wager
that
this
could
have
sat
for
a
lot
more
time
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
i
will
be
getting
more
to
hold
on
to
for
an
extended
period
of
time
unique
is
a
good
way
to
put
this
a
beast
of
a
barleywine
this
one
needs
at
least
the
one
year
recommended
on
the
bottle
without
a
doubt
this
is
the
most
prevalent
alcohol
presence
youll
find
in
a
dfh
beer
imo
overall
i
wouldnt
say
its
great
but
it
does
have
great
potential
ill
have
to
see
what
happens
in
a
few
years
d
a
bruiser
big
bold
and
still
asking
for
all
comers
at
15
the
warmth
is
noticeable
but
pleasant
a
good
nightcap
ale
w
eyelid
dropping
powers
served
this
one
at
cellar
temperature
from
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
into
my
stone
old
guardian
glass
poured
a
deep
copper
that
was
capped
with
a
two
finger
rocky
offwhite
head
head
faded
somewhat
quickly
but
did
leave
a
bit
of
lace
behind
did
notice
some
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smell
was
of
thick
malt
some
bitter
hops
musty
dark
fruits
and
maybe
some
dried
cherries
had
a
bit
of
a
cognac
smell
buried
in
the
background
maybe
a
bit
of
leather
and
dried
tobacco
as
well
pretty
good
flavor
as
well
quite
a
bit
hoppy
thick
malt
plum
raisin
some
woody
notes
with
a
sweet
caramel
like
flavor
in
the
background
all
of
this
finishes
with
a
tremendous
spicey
alcohol
burn
you
cant
miss
the
huge
abv
in
this
one
a
nice
thick
full
mouthfeel
that
is
dominated
by
the
burn
decent
drikability
but
is
definitely
a
sipper
this
one
will
bite
back
drinkabilty
probably
suffers
from
the
abv
at
15
i
am
not
sure
how
many
you
could
drink
great
to
sip
while
hanging
out
excellent
beer
mouthfeel
is
huge
and
slick
and
so
drinkable
for
a
beer
with
15
abv
edit
tasting
the
2007
it
seems
much
sweeter
than
the
2006
more
of
an
english
style
i
think
i
prefer
the
2006
a
beer
i
really
did
not
consider
all
that
sweet
the
2007
seems
more
along
the
lines
of
a
burton
baton
in
fact
i
think
they
put
burton
baton
in
my
bottle
by
mistake
hehe
overall
a
good
barley
wine
the
fact
that
this
15
abv
selection
drinks
as
easily
as
those
closer
to
10
is
impressive
at
just
under
4
for
a
12
ounce
bottle
its
worth
trying
a
favorite
from
years
ago
750
from
2002
cork
came
out
with
a
sound
like
a
weak
fart
yikes
pous
fine
a
thick
toffee
body
and
a
head
whichis
so
brief
it
scarcely
needs
mentioning
flat
and
still
looking
in
my
glass
with
no
lacing
smells
of
toffee
apples
and
alcohol
a
touch
of
that
dfh
reisling
tastes
very
rich
and
malty
alcohol
does
not
make
its
presence
known
in
the
taste
but
it
is
there
and
it
warms
the
belly
this
is
a
very
smooth
drinking
beer
with
no
carbonation
but
the
richness
of
the
malt
makes
this
a
real
sipper
took
me
a
good
part
of
the
afternoon
to
finish
this
a
beer
of
this
size
and
strength
is
a
bit
indulgent
for
one
person
poured
amber
color
into
an
oversized
snifter
small
head
which
dissipated
quickly
looks
like
a
fine
cognac
and
smells
like
one
too
whatever
else
is
in
the
aroma
is
overpowered
by
alcohol
this
translates
into
the
flavor
the
malt
and
hop
flavors
are
again
overpowered
by
the
alcohol
but
the
balance
is
better
as
the
beer
warms
leaner
flavors
than
a
lot
of
barley
wines
and
the
alcohol
hits
pretty
hard
winter
is
really
a
better
time
for
this
beer
it
warms
you
all
the
way
down
into
the
stomach
i
have
one
more
bottle
of
this
and
ill
drink
it
after
the
weather
cools
down
here
solidly
crafted
but
not
my
favorite
dfh
beer
my
first
barleywine
in
quite
a
while
this
was
a
nice
return
to
the
style
for
me
for
the
sample
sent
for
my
ba
annv
drinkability
is
good
but
whoa
this
is
a
big
and
beasty
this
one
could
easily
sit
for
a
while
maybe
ill
visit
the
other
bottle
next
year
sometime
bottled
dated
from
101606
poured
into
a
snifter
i
did
want
to
age
this
a
bit
the
last
bottle
i
had
was
a
bit
of
a
strong
mess
pours
a
nice
amber
orange
color
with
a
fluffy
head
that
does
recede
but
a
rim
stays
the
entire
drink
and
leaves
some
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
sweet
molasses
pear
and
also
some
womens
prefume
taste
is
big
and
powerful
i
had
to
sip
the
giant
but
from
aging
it
it
did
tame
the
wild
beast
very
sweet
on
the
palate
candy
with
hints
of
raison
and
also
some
malt
character
in
there
with
a
strong
alcohol
burn
also
a
bit
of
some
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
this
beer
gets
better
with
time
but
is
very
big
and
could
be
hard
to
drink
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
a
nice
offering
drinkability
this
is
good
ale
its
rather
sweet
and
of
course
very
strong
so
its
a
sipper
and
definitely
not
a
session
beer
a
good
after
dinner
dessert
beer
i
certainly
liked
this
beer
i
had
heard
from
others
who
tried
it
in
a
younger
state
that
it
had
an
overbearing
alcohol
heat
sensation
but
that
certainly
appears
to
have
subsided
with
aging
a
carefullyrationed
slowsipping
treat
that
is
suitable
for
a
rainy
spring
evening
a
truly
distinctive
beer
which
is
a
good
thing
pours
a
beautiul
golden
orange
just
a
little
cloudy
with
a
nice
lacing
aroma
is
deceptively
mild
a
little
banana
maybe
some
of
the
datefig
combination
huge
flavor
of
dates
and
figs
and
unapologetic
alcohol
whack
borders
on
being
a
little
harsh
but
this
is
a
change
of
pace
beer
and
to
me
that
sensation
really
just
wakes
up
the
tongue
crisp
intensely
fruity
aftertaste
true
its
not
subtle
the
dfh
description
calling
it
a
bone
crusher
seems
right
on
but
i
wish
they
would
make
this
yearround
because
its
a
great
complement
to
my
other
favorite
beers
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
stellar
dogfish
head
makes
some
great
beers
but
many
like
this
one
seem
to
be
suffering
a
bit
from
this
general
dogfish
head
idea
of
sweetness
combined
with
high
alcohol
content
which
can
be
a
bit
tiring
overall
truely
a
powerful
barley
wine
a
very
unusual
take
on
the
style
although
very
pleasant
wish
i
had
a
cellar
or
basement
to
lay
one
down
for
a
while
because
this
one
is
going
to
age
very
well
if
you
like
barley
wines
this
is
on
your
todrink
list
poured
a
cloudy
orangered
that
eventually
cleared
upon
standing
head
development
approached
two
fingers
but
settled
rather
quickly
lacing
is
thin
and
fine
smell
is
very
malty
with
an
aromatic
sweetness
aroma
is
fragrant
and
estery
with
a
subtle
note
of
vanilla
however
there
is
an
underlying
acetone
smell
to
the
aromatics
rising
out
of
this
beer
taste
is
very
sweet
and
alcoholic
with
grapefruit
flavors
mouthfeel
is
sticky
yet
crisp
and
the
high
alcohol
content
leads
to
an
almost
burning
warmth
that
is
sure
to
revisit
as
heartburn
drinkability
is
limited
due
to
its
strength
but
otherwise
relatively
easy
to
drink
once
one
gets
past
the
cloying
sweetness
and
burning
alcohol
the
colour
glowed
even
away
from
the
light
the
aroma
was
ripe
it
was
complete
and
complex
the
flavours
have
melded
together
so
harmoniously
so
seamlessly
enjoying
this
beer
is
an
experience
i
wont
soon
ever
forget

a

goes
away

some
slight

sweet

up
front
dark
fruit
grapes
honey
and
small
floral
character
as
well
taste
is
very
sweet

there
is
a
nice
dry

balance
as
it
finishes
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
well
carbonated
which
offers
a
nice
complement
to
the
chewy
sweetness
at
15
i
would
be
lying
if
i
said
it
was
hidden
anything
that
high
in
abv
is
a
little
less
drinkable
in
my
book
still
a
very
nice
barleywine
highly
recommended
drinkability
was
going
to
age
this
but
we
drank
it
over
easter
dinner
hence
the
barley
wine
served
it
chilled
and
was
just
right
with
our
food
hight
in
alchol
so
it
mixed
would
buy
it

at

this
is
the
strongest
beer
i
have
had
so
far
it
is
a
flavorful
brew
that
tastes
of
sour
appleto
me
and
fruit
hops
very
wine
like
i
was
told
it
was
like
old
foghorn
and
in
regards
to
sn
vs
anchor
barley
wine
it
is
closer
to
foghorn
but
not
by
much
in
my
opinion
very
flavorful
but
not
great
worth
a
try
overall
i
would
like
to
thank
ggaughan
for
this
beer
it
was
good
but
i
doubt
i
would
seek
it
out
again
this
is
a
decent
barley
wine
and
something
to
have
for
a
rare
treat
its
not
nearly
as
drinkable
as
sierra
nevadas
bigfoot
for
example
d
this
is
quite
drinkable
for
15
i
would
definitely
have
more
of
this
one
two
more
in
the
cellar
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
they
age
even
further
drinkability
ha
right
15
abv
and
a
complex
palate
keeps
me
from
having
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
beautiful
copper
body
topped
by
a
thick
tan
head
really
thick
for
a
15
abv
beer
head
retention
is
also
very
good
aroma
is
incredibly
sweet
malt
with
brown
sugar
and
fruit
notes
aroma
is
so
good
i
could
just
hold
it
to
my
nose
and
be
pretty
happy
slight
alcoholic
note
but
this
is
after
my
7th
or
8th
deep
inhale
give
me
a
few
more
minutes
of
sniffing
ok
im
back
flavor
surprisingly
light
after
such
a
powerful
scent
its
incredible
that
this
body
and
flavor
come
from
this
beer
actually
well
balanced
decent
bitterness
to
support
the
malt
finishes
with
a
lingering
metallic
note
and
a
touch
of
rubbing
alcohol
but
its
not
really
detracting
from
the
flavor
but
this
is
the
antithesis
of
the
overly
sweet
big
barleywine
it
reminds
me
of
a
beer
with
a
touch
of
vodka
still
powerful
but
not
heavy
bodied
mouthfeel
is
good
very
impressive
lighter
body
for
such
a
big
beer
drinkability
is
actually
very
good
this
drinks
more
like
a
strong
amber
ale
than
one
of
the
stronger
barleywines
available
been
a
while
since
i
had
a
dfh
beer
forgot
how
well
crafted
they
can
be
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
dated
101606
pours
an
amber
color
similar
to
an
unpasteurized
apple
juice
smells
like
candied
fruit
perhaps
apricots
maybe
also
of
molasses
or
brown
sugar
alcohol
smell
is
not
readilly
apparent
taste
is
of
dried
fruit
and
is
very
smooth
a
very
delightful
sipping
type
of
beer
drink
it
too
quickly
and
it
will
catch
up
with
you
approach
this
offering
with
open
mind
and
respect
rest
well
my
well
traveled
friend
you
were
certainly
worth
all
the
miles
bubblewrap
if
you
have
a
chance
to
cellar
this
by
all
means
do
so
half
of
this
bomber
was
more
than
enough
for
me
so
i
would
have
to
say
drinkability
is
somewhat
low
drinkability
for
the
style
this
could
be
dangerous
however
it
could
be
too
complex
for
some
i
struggled
with
this
one
some
of
the
flavors
just
didnt
mesh
well
for
me
the
alcohol
burn
was
over
the
edge
too
olde
school
was
a
chore
to
finish
much
like
homework
for
this
beer
drinker
deep
orange
color
with
an
average
head
that
dissolves
quickly
and
little
lacing
strong
scents
of
hops
flavors
are
sweet
and
well
balanced
the
strong
hop
scent
does
not
come
through
in
the
taste
the
high
alcohol
content
of
this
brew
is
apparent
and
makes
for
an
initially
crisp
mouthfeel
which
subsides
as
you
continue
to
drink
this
is
a
very
drinkable
barleywine
though
it
should
be
shared
with
a
friend
as
suggested
on
the
bottle
drinkability
i
love
the
flavors
but
this
is
a
stong
one
so
when
you
have
a
12
oz
bottle
of
the
olde
school
barleywine
and
follow
that
up
with
a
russian
imperial
from
stone
you
end
up
taking
a
nice
im
a
little
buzzed
nap
at
3pm
on
a
saturday
smooth
and
slick
on
the
mouth
and
very
drinkable
scarily
drinkable
at
15
i
could
easily
pass
out
on
this
one
all
in
all
more
like
an
english
barleywine
than
an
american
but
who
the
hell
cares
its
great
overall
this
is
another
insanely
overthetop
ale
from
the
boys
in
lower
delaware
if
youre
a
barelywine
fan
or
someone
just
looking
to
try
something
a
little
different
id
recommend
it
pours
a
dark
orange
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
fades
and
leaves
little
lacing
at
this
abv
that
is
noy
surprising
the
smell
is
a
little
fainter
than
expected
but
there
are
nice
notes
of
honey
yeast
strong
malt
that
doesnt
quite
approach
soy
sauce
level
and
some
spicy
notes
the
taste
is
surprisingly
dry
and
bitter
there
is
sweetness
here
but
it
doesnt
predominate
the
initial
impression
is
that
this
needs
more
time
in
the
bottle
as
my
example
was
bottled
on
111606
im
sure
thats
true
a
dry
bitterness
to
start
followed
by
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
then
some
spicy
hops
followed
by
a
sticky
maltiness
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
with
a
little
stickiness
on
the
finish
this
is
drinkable
as
is
but
probably
much
more
of
a
knock
out
after
a
year
in
the
cellar
d
pretty
bad
everywhere
except
for
the
taste
is
good
on
this
beer
it
is
absurdly
boozy
even
compared
with
raison
de
extra
or
wws
this
alcohol
completely
ruins
the
beer
i
dont
care
how
high
the
alcohol
is
it
should
not
mask
the
other
flavors
of
the
beer
this
is
a
serious
disappointment
too
strong
to
session
obviously
it
is
also
not
exactly
inviting
me
back
for
another
i
remember
having
this
two
years
ago
perhaps
when
my
tastes
were
less
refined
or
the
recipe
was
different
and
i
adored
it
i
might
buy
this
again
if
someone
i
trust
tells
me
that
this
years
batch
is
not
as
boozy
otherwise
im
done
with
olde
school
d
im
gonna
let
this
one
age
for
about
a
year
and
write
a
new
review
then
but
im
looking
forward
to
trying
it
when
it
mellows
still
a
good
barleywine
d
this
beer
could
use
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
to
mellow
it
out
a
bit
a
little
mad
that
this
is
the
last
one
available
to
me
till
they
brew
it
next
year
im
gonna
pick
a
few
more
up
then
and
let
them
age
for
a
while
so
the
above
being
stated
yes
i
would
love
to
put
a
case
in
the
cellar
and
see
it
mature
in
1020
years
i
can
only
imagine
how
this
one
will
mellow
in
time
d
no
more
than
one
for
me
id
prefer
a
half
pint
of
this
one
still
at
this
percentage
i
guess
this
is
to
be
expected
amberred
translucent
body
with
about
a
half
an
inch
of
offwhite
head
smells
alcoholic
and
fruity
tastes
like
apricot
and
alcohol
citrusy
hops
are
also
there
along
with
just
a
slight
hint
of
a
roasty
malt
kind
of
harsh
but
the
alcohol
is
relatively
wellhidden
mediumbodied
syrupy
mouthfeel
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
doesnt
taste
like
any
barley
wine
ive
had
tastes
more
like
aprihop
its
a
wellcrafted
ale
but
not
something
ill
be
getting
again
probably
my
one
regret
about
this
beer
is
that
the
strenght
is
such
that
i
cant
drink
more
than
two
in
an
evening
thought
i
do
that
in
small
glasses
it
renders
me
inable
to
add
a
latenight
scotch
or
other
entitlement
as
it
is
so
purely
stong
onto
itself
know
clearly
what
you
are
getting
into
expect
something
as
interesting
as
samichlaus
and
dont
be
afraid
to
enjoy
it
on
the
same
level
poured
a
dark
chestnut
an
immediate
waft
of
rubbing
alcohol
from
the
glass
first
sip
is
highly
alcoholic
flavors
awash
in
sweet
caramelcandy
malt
harsh
and
a
bit
of
a
struggle
as
the
beer
warms
the
alcohol
rather
surprisingly
merges
a
bit
with
the
malt
but
still
retains
a
strong
note
throughout
sweetness
tones
down
a
little
and
some
darker
fruit
flavors
peek
through
my
bottle
was
just
a
few
months
old
so
perhaps
a
bit
of
age
will
tame
this
down
as
it
was
it
was
just
too
rough
to
be
enjoyable
d
a
sipping
night
cap
brew
i
wonder
how
this
would
do
in
the
cellar
for
a
couple
of
yearsthe
bitterness
might
mellow
a
tad
tasty
offering
from
dfh
and
another
wildly
high
abv
definitely
worth
a
try
considering
the
15abv
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinks
like
a
less
hoppy
big
ipa
this
beer
is
a
great
example
of
what
age
can
do
for
some
beers
the
sweetness
that
was
most
prominent
and
drowned
out
a
lot
of
other
flavors
in
my
fresh
bottle
mellowed
and
compliments
now
rather
than
overwhelms
worth
leaving
for
a
year
imo
pours
an
orangish
amber
color
that
produces
a
half
inch
white
head
that
eventually
turns
into
a
white
ring
around
the
glass
that
leaves
sporadic
lacing
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
certainly
boozy
with
some
fruit
mostly
apples
and
a
wierd
metallic
twanginess
in
the
background
the
taste
starts
out
smooth
and
malty
which
makes
room
for
ripe
fruit
and
finally
the
alcohol
kicks
in
you
can
definately
feel
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
all
the
way
down
with
this
one
overall
this
is
a
fairly
new
bottle
that
definately
needs
some
time
to
mellow
out
a
little
i
have
another
one
that
i
will
keep
for
awhile
and
will
review
again
in
a
year
or
two
not
bad
but
it
definately
could
use
some
aging
as
the
bottle
suggests
drinks
good
drinkability
at
15
its
rough
but
goes
down
nice
dfh
does
it
again
i
have
one
bottle
left
that
ill
be
letting
sit
for
a
while
and
see
what
happens
it
should
age
well
overall
im
glad
i
tried
it
if
it
was
put
in
front
of
me
i
would
drink
it
other
than
that
its
a
been
there
done
that
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
high
abv
is
noticeable
slight
burn
in
the
mouth
and
on
the
way
down
other
than
that
solid
beer
id
call
this
beer
like
many
of
its
dfh
siblings
a
sipping
beer
or
an
occasional
diversion
from
the
hum
drum
fare
pours
a
deep
redbrown
with
a
slightly
thin
head
has
a
strong
sweet
aroma
with
definite
alcohol
undertones
sweet
fruity
flavors
with
a
good
alcohol
bite
very
malty
slightly
hoppy
has
a
good
mouthfeel
with
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
very
good
barley
wine
pours
with
a
small
sized
head
that
leaves
lacing
and
a
welldefined
collar
around
the
liquid
body
is
ruby
brown
clear
and
bright
the
aroma
first
off
reminds
me
of
banana
chips
dried
sugar
smells
mixed
with
fruit
and
a
bit
of
spice
pears
and
caramel
malts
come
out
with
higher
temperature
and
exposure
to
air
on
the
palate
big
caramel
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
pears
and
apples
for
fruits
at
the
midpalate
its
very
malty
with
just
some
hops
for
bittering
balance
toward
the
end
theres
a
tinge
of
acidity
followed
by
a
quick
dryout
leaving
a
baked
dough
note
for
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
as
usual
for
the
style
with
uncharacteristically
sharp
carbonation
that
helps
lighten
things
a
bit
overall
this
is
a
good
barleywine
made
in
the
english
style
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
aging
does
to
this
this
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
moderate
head
the
lacing
pattern
is
also
very
complete
and
leaves
no
piece
of
glass
uncovered
the
smell
is
very
very
sweet
and
almost
reminds
me
of
cotton
candy
the
smell
begins
to
permeate
as
soon
as
the
top
is
removed
and
this
beer
is
poured
the
taste
is
sweet
as
well
the
same
bubblegum
smell
is
apparent
but
the
addition
of
strong
hops
makes
this
special
the
taste
is
very
large
much
like
a
good
barlywine
should
be
this
is
a
beer
that
should
be
sought
out
and
enjoyed
thoroughly
fresh
bottle
dated
101606
pour
was
a
little
carbonated
with
a
15
abv
the
alcohol
burn
was
noticeable
but
not
overwhelming
i
think
this
beer
needs
to
age
a
bit
this
beer
is
very
sweet
for
a
barley
wine
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
its
flavors
still
this
is
a
tasty
brew
and
i
will
put
a
few
down
to
sit
to
see
what
happens
with
some
age
cheers
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
the
huge
abv
this
is
a
long
sipper
to
say
the
least
some
cellaring
time
should
do
wonders
for
this
drinkable
lol
it
depends
what
you
mean
by
drinkable
i
suppose
there
is
no
way
i
would
drink
more
than
one
of
these
due
solely
to
the
high
alcohol
content
i
dont
enjoy
falling
over
myself
it
is
however
drinkable
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
a
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
beer
definitely
a
sipper
this
should
age
extremely
well
drinkability
is
much
higher
than
i
expected
youre
not
going
to
have
a
few
of
these
but
splitting
one
with
a
friend
is
excellent
now
i
need
to
find
one
to
put
down
in
the
cellar
for
a
year
or
so
seriously
very
relaxing
and
warming
barleywine
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
makes
up
for
it
with
the
generous
use
of
hops
on
the
end
bottle
date
111005
indicating
this
one
is
a
year
old
there
is
a
little
too
much
burn
here
to
make
the
mouthfeel
great
but
there
is
still
a
thick
luxurious
texture
that
is
enjoyable
however
this
is
nothing
that
could
be
consumed
in
quantities
over
a
single
bottle
overall
i
think
there
is
potential
for
this
to
develop
into
something
better
i
drank
an
03
the
other
day
that
id
aged
and
it
was
terrific
this
years
batch
would
do
good
with
some
aging
the
alcohol
shows
through
too
much
in
this
young
state
i
suggest
following
the
instructions
on
the
bottle
which
basically
say
to
bury
it
underground
for
one
year
then
drink
it
the
drinkability
is
great
very
enjoyable
big
fruity
flavor
very
nice
it
left
me
wishing
for
one
more
sip
prosit
mk
i
did
a
little
tasting
of
the
2005
and
2006
versions
of
this
over
the
last
two
days
the
new
one
was
bottled
on
10162006
and
the
old
one
was
bottled
on
11102005
the
appearance
was
very
similar
clear
gold
with
hints
of
orange
my
wife
thought
i
was
drinking
champagne
the
newer
one
had
a
bigger
and
more
persistent
off
white
head
and
was
much
more
effervescent
the
new
one
left
lacing
down
the
glass
on
top
of
glycerin
the
old
one
just
left
the
glycerin
the
smell
is
a
little
grassy
and
some
fruit
with
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
the
older
bottle
had
less
fruit
and
more
grassiness
the
new
one
reminded
me
of
thick
champagne
there
is
a
strong
chardonnay
flavor
in
bottles
figs
pears
and
a
touch
of
hazelnut
the
smells
and
flavors
in
the
old
bottle
are
mixed
together
more
and
harder
to
pick
out
but
they
are
there
i
didnt
really
notice
the
alcohol
level
until
it
hit
my
stomach
and
it
really
warmed
me
up
a
very
sippable
beer
medium
body
with
little
carbonation
slight
alcohol
burn
on
swallowing
but
that
is
expected
with
15
abv
not
as
hoppy
as
some
other
american
barley
wines
but
still
a
nice
example
the
abv
does
hurt
the
drinkability
somewhat
another
good
brew
from
dfh
found
randomly
at
sams
in
fact
i
think
i
got
the
last
4
pack
they
had
pours
hazy
orangey
amber
with
nice
thick
head
that
leaves
lacing
alcohol
is
present
immediately
followed
by
banana
light
hop
aroma
some
bread
and
subdued
sweet
pale
malt
as
it
worms
up
the
sent
grows
on
me
but
the
idea
of
imbibing
so
much
alcohol
with
so
many
residual
sugars
is
a
little
frightening
the
taste
is
much
the
same
as
the
smell
actually
in
some
senses
it
reminds
me
of
certain
tripels
ive
had
i
think
mainly
because
of
the
bready
notes
and
the
ester
quality
for
me
the
real
questionable
issue
is
the
amount
of
alcohol
which
is
defiantly
present
more
so
in
this
than
almost
any
other
beer
ive
had
in
both
the
taste
and
the
smell
the
mouth
feel
is
all
right
but
there
is
definite
too
much
alcohol
honestly
i
was
a
little
disappointed
i
love
that
dfh
is
so
daring
with
their
brews
but
other
than
novelty
sake
this
beer
is
lacking
the
balance
necessary
for
a
super
great
drink
coupled
with
the
fact
that
this
is
a
hard
to
get
beer
and
expensive
i
doubt
ill
buy
this
again
but
its
worth
a
try
for
novelty
sake
dogfish
is
slowly
becoming
one
of
if
not
my
favorite
brewerys
the
more
i
sample
their
offerings
and
this
barley
wine
is
no
exception
pours
a
murkey
orange
with
a
medium
head
and
little
to
no
lacing
smell
is
strong
with
fruit
and
alcohol
presence
as
well
as
toasted
malts
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
much
of
the
same
with
a
heavy
alcohol
presence
and
i
definately
pick
up
on
the
fig
notes
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
rough
because
of
its
carbonated
burning
sensation
but
overall
still
a
smooth
brew
given
its
ac
i
christened
my
new
beer
only
fridge
by
buying
and
stocking
a
6
pack
of
the
12
oz
bottles
after
going
to
a
cocktail
party
and
not
having
anything
alcoholic
to
drink
because
there
wasnt
a
decent
beer
there
i
treated
myself
to
an
old
school
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
i
know
i
know
and
sat
down
and
relaxed
my
wife
laughed
when
i
said
it
was
the
perfect
beer
for
a
33
degree
night
it
looked
beautiful
and
very
lightly
aromatically
hopped
low
carbonation
but
nice
respectable
head
thought
i
tasted
a
hint
of
raisons
but
it
turned
out
according
to
dfh
to
be
figs
this
is
a
dangerous
beer
as
it
goes
down
deceptively
smoothly
with
just
a
hint
of
an
alcoholic
after
taste
more
of
a
warming
effect
than
a
burn
i
am
glad
i
have
5
more
bottles
d
very
good
nice
complex
brew
very
tasty
if
i
find
it
when
i
go
out
of
town
i
will
be
picking
this
up
it
is
a
sipper
though
like
many
dfh
offerings
surprisingly
drinkable
given
the
big
abv
however
this
beer
is
one
to
be
sipped
slowly
and
enjoyed
the
drinkability
is
very
good
i
would
say
i
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
some
more
of
this
i
only
had
one
bottle
of
this
so
it
doesnt
look
like
ill
be
aging
any
of
this
out
it
would
be
perfect
for
the
cellar
overall
its
another
good
brew
from
dogfish
head
although
not
one
of
their
best
overall
a
very
nice
american
barleywine
i
would
recommend
it
but
i
have
to
admit
there
are
lots
of
bwines
out
there
i
think
are
more
comlex
and
interesting
definitely
worth
trying
and
im
sure
ill
continue
to
buy
and
age
more
of
these
d
very
drinkable
at
the
abv
another
great
brew
from
dfh
highly
recommended
2007
edition
bought
at
city
wide
in
south
bend
a
while
ago
pours
slightly
brown
to
orange
beer
with
a
softer
lacing
than
expected
and
just
a
dusting
of
a
white
head
smells
strong
and
sweetly
malty
with
a
fruity
hoppy
punch
a
nice
big
nose
aggressive
and
inviting
big
flavor
too
ive
had
another
aged
olde
school
once
before
and
this
evokes
memories
of
that
experience
big
alcohol
presence
but
the
alcohol
is
wrangled
handily
by
the
complexity
of
flavors
big
fig
and
prune
punch
with
a
large
grassy
bitterness
bitterness
is
still
strong
at
this
1year
stage
but
more
reserved
than
when
new
sweet
sweet
malt
like
tasting
malt
syrup
from
the
can
hints
of
maple
strawberry
anise
ethanol
big
syrupy
mouthfeel
though
not
as
syrupy
as
some
other
dh
beers
a
sipper
of
a
barley
wine
but
a
delicious
one
i
was
forced
to
drink
this
before
i
had
planned
to
due
to
moving
across
the
country
but
it
still
didnt
disappoint
not
by
a
long
shot
very
nice
drinkabilityoverall
a
real
stylebender
here
bspa
imperial
maibock
a
testament
to
the
wide
variability
within
the
barleywine
style
another
one
of
dfhs
look
how
much
booze
we
can
jam
into
your
favorite
style
beers
and
once
again
they
do
it
well
as
the
15
does
not
take
over
little
to
no
hop
presence
means
a
mostly
sugary
and
fruity
experience
surely
interesting
drinkability
another
virtuoso
effort
on
the
strong
beer
from
dfh
though
i
cant
help
feeling
that
they
sometimes
oversweeten
to
compensate
for
high
abv
nonetheless
turning
15
into
a
mild
pepper
finish
deserves
some
credit
in
terms
of
the
style
this
is
a
little
sweet
and
not
quite
as
earthy
in
its
fruits
as
other
barleywines
in
some
ways
i
give
this
the
same
kind
of
pass
i
give
sierra
nevada
beers
dfh
are
going
to
put
their
own
stamp
on
everything
they
do
and
a
little
extra
sweetness
seems
to
go
with
this
check
it
out
as
its
highly
drinkable
but
this
is
a
beer
to
take
on
its
own
terms
rather
than
as
a
representative
brew
tasty
for
sure
but
rather
underwhelming
first
sip
sweetness
then
heat
lots
of
heat
as
i
take
the
few
sips
thereafter
the
heat
subsides
as
my
palate
has
grown
accustomed
to
it
and
finds
the
vast
array
of
flavors
caramel
drizzled
coconut
peaches
yah
a
spicy
pine
sap
twang
from
the
hops
and
were
into
the
alcohol
leaving
behind
a
mellow
sweetness
and
a
warm
belly
still
has
a
bit
of
carbonation
after
its
stay
in
the
cellar
and
right
now
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
very
drinkable
at
this
age
though
its
still
a
bit
hot
certainly
one
to
sample
and
enjoy
after
a
year
or
so
but
im
guessing
this
is
sublime
with
2
on
it
wish
i
had
more
fresh
this
must
be
a
hootenanny
for
the
head
an
excellent
night
cap
zzz
d
bit
cloying
and
over
the
top
bit
too
sweet
and
sugary
i
really
like
this
barley
wine
but
there
is
no
way
i
would
be
able
to
drink
more
than
on
in
a
sitting
i
would
love
to
get
more
and
follow
the
alternate

at
all
in

session
sense
but
completely
perfect
in
the
wow
this
is
awesome

sense
so
much
complexity
that
i
keep
wanting
sip
after
sip
dogfish
head
olde
school
barleywine
pours
an
orangecopper
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
a
bit
spicy
very
interesting
taste
on
the
first
sip
i
feel
absolutely
bombarded
with
a
multitude
of
flavors
fruit
is
definitely
there
so
is
the
alcohol
i
feel
like
i
can
light
my
breath
on
fire
warming
for
sure
some
diacetyl
toward
the
back
it
becomes
hoppier
as
it
warms
i
think
this
one
isnt
terribly
drinkable
in
that
i
sure
couldnt
drink
another
one
and
its
going
to
take
me
a
while
to
finish
the
first
definitely
an
interesting
beer
though
worth
a
try
high
alcohol
but
by
the
style
it
is
very
drinkable
just
sip
on
this
one
this
is
thoroughly
drinkable
theres
just
really
nothing
special
about
this
in
my
opinion
not
as
complex
as
i
hoped
it
would
be
and
something
about
the
aroma
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
peas
beats
i
dont
know
seems
very
young
definately
have
this
around
room
temperature
to
experience
all
the
good
qualities
of
this
barleywine
could
be
a
lot
better
though
i
think
maybe
it
just
needs
some
time
in
the
cellar
i
am
very
excited
to
be
reviewing
this
tonight
as
i
have
no
recolection
of
reviewing
a
barley
wine
and
i
have
an
inexplicable
draw
to
dfh
it
poured
with
a
bit
of
chill
haze
a
bit
of
a
peach
orange
colour
with
a
2
finger
foamy
white
head
with
medium
sized
bubbles
the
head
subsided
in
a
few
minutes
to
a
thin
white
frost
which
leaves
a
decent
looking
ring
of
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
i
thought
the
smell
was
magnificent
very
fruity
and
sweet
it
certainly
tempted
me
i
was
not
expecting
such
fruit
the
taste
too
was
sweet
and
fruity
but
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
smell
which
is
good
seeing
that
that
would
probably
have
been
overpowering
there
is
a
bit
of
noticeable
alcohol
but
at
15
i
think
dfh
did
a
fabulous
job
concealing
such
power
very
manageable
to
be
so
strong
the
mouthfeel
is
certainly
heavy
and
quite
honestly
nearly
syrupy
but
i
like
it
i
do
not
really
have
another
barleywine
with
which
to
compare
this
one
but
as
simply
a
beer
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
this
was
a
beer
i
could
savor
and
enjoy
every
sip
i
guess
it
is
the
most
savory
barleywine
i
have
had
to
date
it
had
decent
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
was
not
too
overwhelming
another
great
one
from
dfh
13008
cant
say
it
has
improved
really
nice
brandycordial
aroma
with
plenty
of
heat
a
lot
of
honeyed
caramel
malt
and
the
sugary
dates
and
figs
add
a
nice
complexity
has
developed
an
appealing
gentle
sour
note
on
the
tongue
with
a
nice
bit
of
date
in
the
finish
honey
malt
coats
the
lips
after
sipping
i
think
its
the
dates
that
give
an
impression
of
honey
here
coats
your
mouth
with
awesome
about
an
inch
thick
suprisingly
easy
on
the
head
for
15
make
sure
you
have
this
when
its
warmed
some
the
great
range
of
aromas
really
come
out
as
it
warms
when
its
cold
they
seem
very
mild
very
good
job
for
a
15
beer
i
must
say
a
fresh
bottle
might
be
brutal
but
this
particular
sample
had
no
brutality
to
it
id
get
this
again
slightly
red
tinged
golden
no
head
no
lacing
almost
looks
innocent
so
clear
so
simple
looking
doesnt
really
smell
frightening
or
alcoholic
some
fruityness
a
hint
of
chocolateyness
almost
cocoa
tastes
chocolatey
and
sweet
a
bit
winey
and
very
very
sneaky
warming
quite
warming
the
15
just
sneaks
right
by
you
youd
never
know
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
id
expect
it
to
be
drinkable
for
something
this
strong
to
be
sure
not
something
to
chug
or
have
every
night
but
when
in
the
mood
id
go
for
this
cheers2beers
immort
ale
on
steroids
basically
the
same
color
burnt
orange
pours
a
bit
on
the
syrupy
side
though
not
as
thick
as
a
samichlaus
good
aroma
lots
of
fruit
apricot
peach
i
like
the
taste
but
unlike
some
other
barleywines
the
15
abv
wont
let
you
make
a
session
of
this
has
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
burn
to
start
that
dwindles
after
a
bit
and
the
sweetness
of
this
brew
starts
to
dominate
actually
its
a
bit
too
sweet
it
also
has
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
for
a
barley
this
is
a
good
one
to
pair
with
some
cheese
or
any
other
food
that
would
subdue
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
however
id
take
an
immort
ale
over
this
maybe
as
the
bottle
writing
suggests
this
needs
to
be
buried
in
a
hole
for
a
few
years
then
maybe
all
that
goes
into
brewing
this
will
meld
together
a
bit
better
below
average
drinkability
for
a
15
abv
beer
i
think
the
mouthfeel
and
lack
of
balance
definitely
work
against
it
this
is
a
fantastic
barley
wine
that
incorporates
its
walloping
15
abv
very
well
obviously
not
huge
drinkability
here
but
a
real
treat
that
ill
be
coming
back
for
again
just
not
in
the
same
session
it
packs
a
punch
i
bought
a
4pack
so
i
will
be
aging
2
bottles
i
will
definetly
be
wrting
once
i
try
those
two
beers
for
a
barley
wine
this
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
from
the
scent
i
feared
that
this
would
be
sugary
but
it
is
not
and
a
surprise
considering
who
makes
it
this
isnt
a
hop
bomb
super
tasty
brew
that
i
do
recommend
olde
school
poured
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
a
tiny
head
that
stuck
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
nose
was
very
sweet
with
notes
of
honey
fruit
and
a
faint
hop
aroma
taste
was
extremely
sweet
almost
like
drinking
a
glass
of
honey
with
a
nice
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
hop
bitterness
was
present
but
kind
of
restrained
for
an
american
barleywine
the
sweet
fruity
taste
was
way
too
overpowering
for
my
palate
at
times
this
beer
reminded
me
of
a
mead
did
the
brewery
release
this
too
early
this
is
the
first
beer
from
dogfish
head
that
has
disappointed
me
and
i
hope
to
hell
it
doesnt
happen
again
ive
got
2
more
bottles
of
this
brew
that
i
plan
on
cellaring
for
a
year
and
see
if
it
improves
with
age
this
beer
if
you
can
call
it
that
i
would
say
it
is
more
of
a
wine
it
is
a
barleywine
so
i
guess
it
is
both
the
taste
of
this
drink
is
truly
amazing
the
color
and
smell
is
also
appealing
i
would
recommend
this
drink
to
anyone
that
likes
stronger
beers
drinkability
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
brew
this
beer
is
a
big
and
bad
the
alcohol
may
be
a
bit
boisterous
for
some
peoples
taste
but
i
want
more
poured
an
exceptionally
clear
orange
hued
coppery
color
into
two
snifters
as
directed
by
bottle
directions
left
a
thin
white
half
finger
head
even
with
a
rougher
pour
left
thin
sticky
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
smells
richly
of
caramel
malt
with
a
nice
fruitiness
along
with
hints
of
hops
and
alcohol
also
present
taste
begins
sweet
and
fruity
then
breadygrainy
then
leaves
off
with
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
along
with
a
slight
nip
of
alcohol
the
15
abv
is
hidden
veryvery
well
one
could
easily
mistake
it
for
far
less
as
sweet
and
smooth
as
this
barleywine
is
mouthfeel
is
moderate
to
heavier
bodied
coating
the
mouth
with
an
oilslick
feeling
afterwards
light
on
carbonation
slight
bitter
aftertaste
frighteningly
drinkable
admirably
complex
this
is
my
first
and
far
from
last
barleywine
overall
another
enjoyable
offering
from
the
folks
at
dogfish
head
would
seek
out
again
drinkability
scary
be
very
very
careful
it
goes
down
too
smoothly
poured
a
soft
brown
color
with
orange
copper
hues
and
a
mighty
white
colored
head
that
remained
intact
for
sometime
aromas
of
alcohol
and
citrus
seemed
to
dominate
though
some
pine
and
earthy
scents
were
present
though
faint
the
taste
was
semisweet
with
a
fair
amount
of
hop
bitterness
upfront
the
sweet
roasted
malts
came
out
nicely
in
the
tail
end
of
each
sip
with
a
lingering
dryness
in
the
finish
the
alcohol
was
hidden
to
a
certain
extent
in
that
did
not
overly
dominate
the
flavors
in
the
beer
as
i
thought
it
might
with
such
a
high
abv
the
mild
carbonation
and
fruity
flavors
coated
my
mouth
nicely
but
the
drinkability
just
wasnt
there
for
me
im
glad
i
shared
this
12
oz
bottle
because
i
wouldnt
have
been
able
to
finish
it
interesting
to
try
but
not
a
great
barleywine
the
only
hesitancy
i
have
to
give
the
drinkability
a
perfect
5
is
that
theres
nothing
too
amazing
in
the
sensation
of
drinking
it
this
beer
would
definately
benefit
from
aging
the
cleanliness
should
allow
some
pronounced
flavors
without
anything
nasty
happening
perhaps
after
a
year
thisll
be
a
perfect
barley
wine
beermail
me
if
you
know
where
some
is
being
sold
boston
area
12
ounce
bottle
either
an
03
or
an
04
impossible
to
tell
lets
say
it
is
an
04
pours
a
wonderful
amber
color
with
a
very
small
amount
of
white
head
that
quickly
retreated
leaving
a
ring
around
the
glass
and
somewhat
spotty
lacing
smell
of
apricots
figs
oranges
vanilla
and
some
brown
sugar
taste
starts
out
with
orange
and
apricot
then
turns
to
a
more
caramel
and
brown
sugar
flavor
finishing
with
some
darker
fruits
of
which
plum
and
raison
seem
to
be
most
noticeable
and
a
hint
of
piney
hops
and
alcohol
warmth
at
the
very
end
mouthfeel
is
heavy
but
seems
to
be
about
right
with
very
little
carbonation
a
very
enjoyable
drink
but
one
to
be
enjoyed
in
moderation
this
is
as
drinkable
as
15
can
get
a
remarkable
delicious
effort
from
dfh
i
dont
like
everything
they
make
but
this
is
truly
magnificent
aroma
is
light
and
somewhat
hoppy
opaque
orange
in
color
very
still
with
no
head
much
more
fruity
and
wine
tasting
than
most
barleywines
i
have
had
lacks
the
oxidization
i
find
off
putting
alcohol
is
definitely
there
but
amazingly
well
hidden
there
is
a
fruity
flavor
through
all
flavor
ranges
but
if
i
didnt
know
dates
and
figs
were
used
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
those
two
another
amazingly
unique
beer
by
dfh
this
is
a
one
incredible
nectar
and
nectar
is
the
perfect
word
for
it
the
biggest
little
brewery
that
could
rock
on
dogfish
overall
an
outstanding
american
barleywine
highly
recommended
the
beer
after
its
disinterment
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
a
clarion
amber
with
a
monstrous
light
tan
head
that
is
creamy
in
texture
with
the
left
over
lace
a
tight
girdle
that
clings
to
the
glass
like
ebenezer
scrooge
to
a
gold
sovereign
nose
has
a
nice
malt
presence
a
hint
of
hops
sweet
like
vanilla
taffy
start
is
also
sweet
with
a
good
grain
presence
and
the
top
moderate
in
feel
finish
is
adequately
acidic
the
alcohol
noticeable
and
the
hops
subdued
dry
and
pleasing
to
the
palate
what
can
i
say
about
dogfish
head
beers
accept
i
loveem
and
they
do
so
good
with
disco
music
lol
would
love
to
try
this
a
again
tomorrow
with
sweet
sour
pork
b
a
year
from
now
after
it
has
had
a
long
sleep
and
or
c
a
combination
of
ab
drinkability
taste
when
only
three
months
old
this
brew
shows
some
very
interesting
character
and
unusual
flavor
ill
look
forward
to
seeing
what
this
is
like
with
some
age
on
it
it
is
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
you
can
definitely
enjoy
one
but
more
than
that
is
a
little
rough
on
the
palate
an
overwhelming
beer
age
has
done
this
one
well
the
somewhat
cloying
sweetness
of
fresh
olde
school
has
dryed
to
a
smooth
malt
flavor
the
hops
that
are
left
seem
floral
and
this
tastes
more
like
an
english
barleywine
to
me
mouthfeel
is
heavy
a
little
syrupy
i
like
it
highly
drinkable
in
what
may
be
middleage
for
this
beer
this
is
definitely
has
the
characteristic
flavors
of
dogfish
heads
other
higher
alcohol
beers
the
intense
sweet
malt
and
fruit
character
this
is
pretty
good
but
seems
to
be
missing
a
lot
of
complexity
that
would
make
this
more
fittingly
a
contemplative
sipping
brew
that
the
alcohol
level
demands
a
really
like
the
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
make
for
a
pleasant
experience
the
alcohol
will
rear
its
head
in
the
end
as
the
beer
warms
makes
me
feel
all
warm
and
fuzzy
inside
i
think
i
will
try
this
one
in
another
year
to
see
if
the
flavor
improves
hopefully
it
will
cheers
notes
for
a
brew
weighing
in
at
15
it
certainly
does
not
seem
like
it
i
can
note
the
alcohol
in
the
flavor
and
in
the
smell
but
my
senses
pick
up
something
more
like
9
or
10
cheers
to
dfh
for
producing
a
beer
with
a
wellconcealed
abv
as
with
a
lot
of
their
beers
the
price
makes
me
whimper
but
the
product
makes
me
smile
bottled
on
date
of
november
11th
2005
pours
a
slightly
murky
copper
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
retains
impressively
well
for
a
15
brew
the
aroma
is
quite
malty
with
a
big
rum
soaked
fruit
character
apples
grapes
oranges
plums
some
citrus
and
floral
hops
caramel
apples
vanilla
toasted
bread
and
ethanol
the
flavor
starts
off
with
candied
fruit
soaked
in
rum
floral
citrus
and
piney
hops
toasted
bread
vanilla
oak
and
a
big
alcohol
wallop
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
moderate
body
and
light
carbonation
and
the
finish
is
a
bit
sweet
and
alcohol
ridden
drinkability
is
better
than
i
expected
dfh
did
well
concealing
the
alcohol
in
this
though
it
is
still
very
present
an
interesting
barleywine
not
over
the
top
hoppy
like
many
could
definately
age
for
a
few
years
this
pours
a
amber
color
with
a
nice
creamy
head
the
color
is
lighter
than
other
barleywines
and
the
head
disappears
too
fast
the
smell
is
alcohol
filled
with
sugarmaltand
hops
the
taste
has
a
very
strong
sweetness
to
it
that
dominated
the
taste
is
like
baking
sugar
theres
not
the
fruit
taste
that
other
barleywines
have
theres
also
a
carmel
and
alcohol
aftertaste
that
make
this
a
little
rich
its
a
good
tastebut
its
really
nothing
special
the
mf
is
medium
and
not
really
well
balanced
this
is
a
good
beerbut
i
really
thought
a
barleywine
from
dogfish
head
would
be
better
pours
a
clear
copper
with
plenty
of
carbonation
leaves
no
head
just
a
slight
soapy
ring
around
the
top
of
the
glass
with
nice
lacing
smell
of
carmelized
sugar
tastes
are
of
sweet
alcohol
with
slight
bitter
and
fruityness
it
may
be
the
color
but
apple
maybe
medium
to
heavy
mouthfeel
carbonation
still
very
present
pretty
drinkable
but
i
expected
more
from
dfh
not
very
impressive
or
exciting
very
nice
bright
coppery
golden
color
nice
amount
of
bubbles
slowly
rising
to
the
top
mellow
low
aroma
slight
hopiness
to
it
underlying
malty
sweetnessmustiness
in
there
as
well
big
malt
flavor
nicely
and
lightly
hopped
great
caramel
flavors
slight
alcohol
tinge
killer
bodythick
and
viscuous
though
not
overly
so
the
whole
package
is
really
well
balanced
here
a
fantastic
brew
really
has
become
quite
the
beer
from
the
sample
i
had
3
years
ago
a
real
sipper
i
find
myself
wanting
to
take
large
tastes
to
really
enjoy
it
and
after
half
a
glass
i
can
feel
its
effects
damn
good
beer
this
barleywine
poured
a
golden
amber
color
with
plenty
of
caronation
and
no
head
the
aroma
suprised
me
almost
a
whitewine
nose
a
little
like
the
russian
river
i
rated
a
while
back
obviously
a
different
style
and
brewery
but
just
a
faint
resemblance
anyhow
atop
the
white
wine
thing
was
apple
spice
yeast
and
major
hoppy
tones
i
was
dying
to
dive
right
in
but
was
somewhat
disappointed
the
wine
taste
was
gone
replaced
by
a
good
ammount
of
very
obvious
alcohol
sweet
malts
flowery
hops
possibly
vanilla
and
please
excuse
going
way
out
on
a
limb
a
mild
taste
of
overripe
bananas
it
was
very
carbonated
and
biting
but
that
along
with
the
taste
slightly
improved
as
it
warmed
cheers
is
it
drinkable
yes
very
much
so
is
it
special
no
i
am
surprised
at
this
dfh
offering
it
is
one
of
the
least
spectacular
offerings
i
have
had
from
them
still
with
that
said
this
is
a
good
barleywine
it
wouldnt
make
my
personal
top
10
but
i
will
like
to
try
it
again
i
hope
i
can
i
got
my
bottle
from
redhaze
thank
you
very
much
i
did
enjoy
every
drop
worth
a
try
looks
of
a
freshpressed
apple
juice
clear
with
some
voluminous
forcepour
bubbles
and
not
much
else
no
real
lacing
either
nose
is
boozy
bubblegum
hints
and
some
cinnamon
mild
hoppiness
is
lost
to
the
scotchlike
aroma
light
and
mild
flavors
burns
a
bit
going
down
but
leans
on
the
crutch
of
ginger
notes
apricot
and
hop
resin
raw
malts
and
sweet
syrupy
blotches
round
out
the
bizarre
flavor
variety
found
within
i
remember
this
being
buttery
and
limp
its
transformed
itself
into
a
fruity
explosive
masterpiece
will
drink
as
much
fresh
as
i
can
get
my
hands
on
drinkability
any
beer
that
says
to
split
it
into
two
snifters
on
the
label
must
be
a
whopper
and
this
one
assuredly
is
definitely
a
sipper
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
and
allow
to
warm
thanks
to
px2grafx
for
a
sample
of
a
beer
that
i
have
wanted
to
try
for
a
long
time
is
this
fun
or
what
highly
flocculant
yeast
hardly
stirred
at
all
as
a
result
the
pour
was
very
clear
but
i
swirled
and
added
yeast
back
the
beer
had
rather
low
head
the
color
was
a
deep
golden
the
aroma
was
sweet
with
a
honey
note
and
some
kind
of
citrusy
notes
too
like
lemon
rather
than
the
cascade
type
of
citrus
almost
winelike
the
flavor
was
dominated
by
sweetness
almost
cloying
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
at
the
end
the
beer
seemed
a
little
onedimensional
and
was
a
little
disappointing
it
was
smooth
though
for
the
alcohol
content
maybe
too
smooth
i
couldnt
find
a
bottle
date
but
i
suspect
it
was
rather
young
drinkability
fairly
drinkable
heavy
on
the
alcohol
overall
im
not
sure
how
old
this
is
but
it
has
a
beautifully
rounded
edge
to
the
high
alcohol
malts
and
hops
oh
this
is
so
bloody
good
it
went
down
way
too
quickly
for
a
double
digit
brew
it
could
be
an
early
night
for
me
a
big
ass
brew
that
would
suit
me
just
right
if
i
was
back
in
england
tonight
sat
in
thy
dark
round
the
bonfire
celebrating
the
400th
anniversary
of
guy
fawkes
failed
gunpowder
plot
15
you
say
either
way
its
pretty
good
key
word
is
sipping
i
downed
this
beer
in
30min
as
i
often
do
from
constant
sipping
to
find
the
flavor
ect
now
i
feel
buzzed
more
drinkable
than
i
expected
but
i
will
not
likely
have
this
often
it
may
be
too
sweet
and
alcoholic
for
some
persons
like
my
wife
who
does
not
like
it
but
is
thinking
of
it
as
beer
rather
than
a
wine
apertif
or
brandy
like
drink
i
am
glad
that
i
have
more
in
the
cellar
is
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
for
such
a
big
beer
my
face
is
warm
already
and
ive
only
had
23
of
a
bottle
to
drink
12
oz
bottle
which
ive
had
for
3
monthsno
date
though
so
i
dont
know
the
age
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
thin
white
cap
of
head
no
lacing
at
all
nose
is
a
sweet
molasses
and
caramel
with
a
note
of
dark
fruitiness
and
just
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
about
to
be
consumed
taste
starts
out
rich
and
sweet
blends
of
molasses
candi
sugar
plums
and
raisins
and
then
a
nice
smooth
rising
hoppy
bitterness
hits
in
the
middle
of
a
sip
with
a
long
smooth
warming
finish
with
just
a
hint
of
the
15
alcohol
extremely
complex
tastes
balanced
beautifully
to
give
a
great
sipping
experience
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
thick
and
syrupy
this
is
a
good
sipping
barleywine
that
hides
its
alcohol
well
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
in
a
session
but
i
will
definitely
be
revisiting
this
beer
again
pours
a
very
clear
golden
small
head
little
bit
of
lacing
nice
legs
smell
is
alcohol
citrus
apple
lots
of
malt
honey
sweetness
the
smell
is
just
out
of
control
and
amazing
taste
is
sweet
malt
some
alcohol
white
grapes
apples
tons
of
citrus
hops
very
smooth
for
such
a
big
guy
mouthfeel
is
medium
dry
bitter
finish
this
one
powerful
bastard
almost
knocked
me
on
my
ass
first
sip
excellent
mostly
clear
medium
amber
beer
with
a
bit
of
an
orange
hue
thin
white
head
thats
a
combination
of
fine
foam
and
large
bubbles
nice
lacing
and
good
head
retention
big
malty
aroma
with
lots
of
caramel
and
moderate
alcohol
fresh
apple
fruit
character
is
prominent
as
well
nice
balance
of
flavours
for
such
a
big
beer
lots
of
malt
sweetness
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
keep
it
in
check
theres
also
a
fruity
grape
flavour
that
adds
some
complexity
alcohol
flavour
is
apparent
throughout
but
becomes
more
pronounced
and
spicy
at
the
sweetish
finish
low
soft
carbonation
with
a
full
body
somewhat
lighter
than
expected
mellow
mouthfeel
with
plenty
of
alcohol
warmth
and
a
bit
of
residual
sugar
that
leaves
it
slightly
sticky
surprising
drinkable
given
the
abv
definitely
a
big
strong
brew
i
bet
this
one
ages
like
a
champ
thanks
viggo
impressively
smooth
considering
the
alcohol
content
and
the
hop
additions
it
picks
up
on
all
the
plumbey
pruneey
dates
and
figs
that
i
expect
in
a
bw
the
hop
flavors
are
pronounced
but
not
overly
agressive
like
most
this
makes
for
an
impresively
easy
drinking
beer
i
get
some
molassas
and
honey
flavors
into
the
body
and
through
the
finish
that
i
like
although
the
flavors
are
better
balanced
this
is
by
no
means
a
lighter
bw
it
still
packs
a
punch
in
the
flavor
alcohol
and
body
categories
its
just
better
balances
and
aged
mmmm
good
beer
good
night
not
really
sure
what
to
think
of
with
the
olde
school
barleywine
label
this
is
one
of
the
only
clear
blonde
barleywines
ive
seen
recently
besides
anchors
does
that
make
it
oldeschool
drinakability
is
nice
very
easy
drinking
hard
to
imagine
that
it
is
15
this
beer
is
to
way
easy
to
drink
could
lead
to
trouble
didnt
know
if
i
would
like
this
after
my
immport
ale
tasting
but
this
kicks
ass
not
your
normal
barley
wine
to
be
sure
after
two
the
buzz
might
be
going
to
my
head
a
little
but
i
like
this
and
would
recommend
buying
some
if
you
can
a
nice
beer
but
i
tend
to
prefer
barley
wines
with
a
butt
load
of
hops
assaulting
me
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
syrupy
heavier
in
body
the
finish
is
syrupy
with
a
long
caramel
alcohol
finish
drinkability
is
not
bad
but
one
bottle
was
enough
in
one
sitting
a
sweeter
barleywine
than
others
but
worth
trying
taste
was
syrupy
on
the
tongue
but
not
overly
sweet
at
all
sugary
caramel
sweetness
up
front
that
hits
with
a
earthy
flavor
that
i
could
not
place
and
finishes
slightly
dry
but
not
really
hard
to
explain
this
is
a
sipper
at
15
so
be
careful
not
my
favorite
barley
but
very
enjoyable
i
am
impressed
with
the
balance
when
using
such
massive
malt
and
hop
elements
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
this
means
easy
sippin
thanks
joe
for
the
treat
poured
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
that
took
its
time
to
fall
to
a
rather
thick
film
on
top
this
left
wonderful
lacing
down
my
glass
the
smess
was
of
fruits
like
peaches
cherries
and
flowers
all
smashed
into
one
there
was
also
a
bit
of
alcohol
present
in
the
smell
as
well
the
taste
was
sweet
with
apricots
peaches
and
candy
it
has
a
slight
hoppy
finish
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
was
present
but
very
well
hidden
the
mouthfeel
was
full
rich
and
very
satisfying
i
can
say
that
his
was
pretty
darn
good
very
enjoyable
brew
thanks
dogfish
for
another
winner
finishes
sticky
sweet
with
a
bit
of
tartness
the
head
begins
to
warm
though
pretty
drinkable
the
abv
is
ninja
like
in
its
stealthiness
absolutely
an
outstading
barleywine
the
15
making
all
the
more
remarkable
it
reminds
me
of
my
fave
bw
jw
lees
pick
a
year
still
my
fave
harvest
ale
maybe
not
quite
as
mellow
and
refined
but
close
i
cannot
not
believe
i
havent
rated
this
before
i
have
been
drinking
this
for
at
least
8
months
but
i
am
glad
i
waited
because
it
as
gotten
better
as
it
aged
in
the
old
basement
cellar
poured
a
nice
honey
with
a
nice
white
head
with
good
lacing
aroma
hops
sugar
malts
grassey
alcohol
musty
citrus
lemon
flavor
hops
mats
semi
sweet
grapefruit
and
the
alcohol
comes
out
nicely
going
to
have
to
buy
more
of
this
just
to
have
it
age
for
a
while
drinkability
good
for
the
style
it
would
be
most
unwise
to
persue
this
olde
brew
at
length
but
it
is
certainly
tempting
a
nice
primer
for
things
to
follow
or
a
night
cap
to
warm
the
spirit
im
going
to
chase
this
with
a
bells
third
coast
old
ale
to
reassociate
my
tongue
with
a
real
barleywine
this
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
quickly
and
leaves
very
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
had
a
lot
of
caramel
and
dark
fruits
with
some
alcohol
the
alcohol
is
very
upfront
in
the
flavor
but
this
is
very
new
it
needs
some
age
has
a
nice
hop
character
and
caramel
malt
sweetness
the
drinkability
is
a
little
harsh
because
of
the
high
alcohol
but
still
not
too
bad
mouthfeel
is
right
on
tastes
like
malted
grape
fruit
juice
hoppy
in
the
finish
with
the
abv
well
hidden
light
mouthfeel
for
the
style
drinkable
if
it
wasnt
for
the
high
abv
and
equally
high
price
4
99
a
bottle
bottle
poured
a
light
brown
color
ale
with
a
medium
head
with
medium
retention
carbonation
is
above
average
for
a
barley
wine
and
body
is
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
aroma
consisted
of
dates
and
figs
with
strong
malt
taste
is
quite
enjoyable
with
some
sweetness
but
not
too
much
balance
well
against
the
malt
and
hops
finish
is
slightly
dry
with
some
subtle
water
which
did
disappoint
me
alcohol
is
not
really
discernable
overall
i
guess
this
is
a
good
barley
wine
but
i
had
some
better
one
like
most
high
alcohol
beers
it
has
only
a
very
slight
head
to
it
why
is
that
by
the
way
but
unlike
most
it
left
an
appreciable
amount
of
foam
lace
on
the
glass
glancing
at
my
glass
i
could
just
as
easily
guess
that
i
was
drinking
a
hopdevil
it
doesnt
seem
as
viscous
as
most
barleywines
not
an
especially
distinctive
beer
hey
they
do
call
it
olde
school
especially
coming
from
dogfish
but
very
enjoyable
pours
a
light
copper
to
golden
rather
light
for
a
barley
wine
creates
thousands
of
bubbles
that
cling
to
the
sides
of
my
snifter
as
i
give
it
a
swirl
looks
quite
thick
smells
of
sweet
sweet
apricots
flavor
is
also
sweet
and
the
alcohol
is
very
present
here
there
are
some
citrus
notes
and
apricot
is
found
again
this
is
thick
and
sticky
leaves
a
coat
on
the
palate
as
it
goes
down
pleasantly
warming
wow
this
beer
is
freaking
huge
i
can
drink
one
and
its
enjoyable
but
thats
about
as
far
as
id
go
i
must
say
that
ive
had
better
barleywines
but
this
one
is
unique
and
still
quite
good
it
could
afford
to
be
a
little
darker
and
a
little
less
fruity
dogfish
head
should
get
credit
for
expanding
the
definition
of
an
american
barley
wine
with
this
offering
there
is
a
mix
of
styles
here
that
amount
to
a
well
balanced
beer
at
4
99
for
12
ounces
its
a
splurge
but
it
is
special
thanks
again
to
irishmike
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
surprised
ive
let
this
one
go
for
so
long
it
poured
with
a
pure
caramel
body
that
was
crystal
clear
quite
a
beauty
the
head
was
nice
big
and
creamy
the
mouthfeel
is
very
heavy
and
syrupy
great
complexity
to
the
taste
i
first
notice
a
casky
flavor
with
a
whiskeytype
edge
to
it
but
its
also
balanced
with
a
smooth
and
creamy
vanilla
subtleness
it
really
accentuates
the
great
balance
the
finish
is
a
little
more
figgy
and
somewhat
vinous
unexpectedly
theres
also
some
nice
hop
bitterness
going
on
that
is
countered
nicely
with
a
candy
sweetness
a
great
belly
warming
offering
that
you
must
be
sure
not
to
drink
to
quickly
complex
and
divine
pours
a
creamy
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
doesnt
look
a
thing
like
a
barleywine
the
smell
is
a
rich
but
oddly
hop
focused
one
the
alcohol
is
mild
in
the
taste
the
alcohol
is
also
hardly
present
and
only
rounds
off
the
beer
what
got
me
about
this
beer
was
the
fact
that
it
wasnt
really
a
barleywine
it
was
more
like
and
overthetop
tripel
and
thats
not
what
i
want
in
a
barleywine
ill
still
give
cheers
to
dogfish
head
for
always
pushing
the
envelope
overall
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
and
certainly
not
what
i
would
call
an
old
school
barley
wine
drinkability
is
decent
given
the
youth
of
this
beer
if
i
close
my
eyes
and
pretend
that
im
drinking
brandy
then
its
quite
smooth
i
wish
i
would
have
aged
it
another
year
or
two
to
bringout
more
of
the
subtle
flavors
that
lurk
underneath
the
alcohol
but
it
was
still
good
not
a
session
beer
but
certainly
a
fine
product
pours
a
murky
bronze
orange
color
with
a
thin
small
white
head
kind
of
ugly
really
but
whatever
aroma
is
sweet
and
hoppy
citrus
is
there
and
a
belgian
candi
sugar
flavor
along
with
smoke
and
then
lots
of
alcohol
the
taste
brings
about
a
whiskey
kick
almost
immediately
this
goes
with
a
woody
earthiness
that
brings
some
oak
and
vanilla
was
this
aged
in
jd
barrels
or
some
kind
of
whiskey
barrel
dark
fruits
are
there
along
with
lighter
fruits
the
finish
finally
brings
some
brash
bitterness
and
more
fusel
alcohol
long
lingering
finish
could
definitely
be
a
sipper
could
definitely
age
another
year
as
well
maybe
ten
years
but
really
its
quite
good
fresh
i
like
the
boldness
of
this
beer
beautiful
golden
orange
smell
of
dried
fruit
citrus
spices
sweet
not
overly
amazingly
drinkable
for
15abv
tiny
pricks
of
carbonation
thick
luscious
mouthfeel
zingy
peppery
finish
complex
and
delicious
certainly
one
of
a
kind
a
highly
original
take
on
the
barleywine
first
class
the
drinkability
suffered
a
bit
due
to
the
high
buzz
factor
and
the
sugary
sweet
taste
and
i
cannot
see
drinking
much
more
than
a
single
pint
of
this
on
any
given
night
this
one
needs
to
evolve
my
slightly
burning
chest
bellows
cellar
this
beer

i
have
had
a
good
amount
of
better
barley
wines
but
this
baby
needs
time
this
is
a
very
good
cold
weather
beer
even
with
the
high
alcohol
it
is
masked
so
well
that
this
beer
goes
down
easily
and
is
quite
enjoyable
in
the
process
d
very
clean
beer
but
a
bit
to
hot
compared
for
the
hops
it
would
be
nice
to
see
some
more
depth
to
the
hops
or
malt
in
this
one
for
once
dogfish
has
made
a
beer
and
done
the
exact
opposite
of
what
theyre
infamous
for
making
crazy
interpretations
on
a
classic
style
not
to
say
this
brew
is
bad
by
any
means
but
as
it
stands
this
beer
has
no
fatal
flaws
but
nor
does
it
do
anything
to
distinguish
itself
from
the
rest
in
all
honesty
i
dont
even
think
this
is
a
true
barleywine
but
thats
just
my
humble
opinion
good
but
not
great
temperatures
dropped
rapidly
tonight
when
i
finally
made
it
in
out
of
the
elements
i
found
myself
craving
a
nice
solid
barleywine
to
warm
me
up
i
knew
olde
school
would
do
the
job
with
its
whopping
15
abv
ive
grown
found
of
drinking
barleywines
out
of
shaker
pints
something
about
the
way
it
warms
up
and
the
feeling
of
having
all
that
barleywine
under
your
nose
at
once
so
thats
what
this
one
went
into
the
body
of
this
beer
is
a
bit
more
translucent
and
less
red
than
many
other
barleywines
ive
seen
still
with
the
tiny
bottleconditioned
carbonation
bubbles
streaming
to
the
top
it
is
a
sight
to
see
the
robust
eggshell
head
from
the
pour
rapidly
recedes
into
a
solid
ring
around
the
outside
of
the
pint
the
nose
is
heavy
with
fusel
alcohol
aromas
doesnt
turn
me
off
though
a
closer
whiff
reveals
figs
nuts
berries
grapefruit
and
pine
this
beer
is
rich
with
hefty
malt
flavors
across
the
front
of
the
palate
caramel
grain
toffee
the
bitterness
level
is
great
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
a
good
barleywine
and
the
pine
and
grapefruit
hop
flavors
are
very
assertive
as
well
i
also
pick
up
some
nuttiness
berries
and
figs
in
the
flavor
this
is
right
before
alcohol
crashes
on
my
tongue
and
hits
my
nose
from
the
inside
out
warmth
rapidly
and
welcomely
spreads
down
my
gullet
personally
i
think
this
is
a
great
barleywine
i
will
say
that
i
love
strong
beers
but
even
i
feel
that
the
alcohol
could
be
masked
a
little
better
here
then
again
at
15
what
should
i
expect
had
again
4
years
later
and
found
it
rather
ordinary
barleywine
withd
ecent
mouthfeel
and
drinakbility
highly
recommended
it
gets
beyond
mellow
while
it
sits
i
poured
this
at
about
50
degrees
and
as
it
got
up
to
room
temprature
it
was
super
mellow
very
super
mellow
real
nice
quality
to
have
as
it
seems
to
get
more
drinkable
as
you
go
yet
as
soon
as
it
hits
the
lips
it
demands
you
sip
interesting
charactistic
this
is
a
seemingly
complexing
alcoholic
beverage
that
does
hide
its
beefy
abv
very
well
its
not
all
that
overly
heated
or
alcoholicboozy
its
quite
brazenless
in
that
regards
its
smooth
and
creamy
body
is
a
wonderment
and
maintains
a
favorable
slick
texture
good
stuff
sooo
very
close
to
getting
the
next
number
up
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
honey
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
seems
pretty
light
colored
for
a
barleywine
head
disappears
quickly
fruity
notes
present
as
well
as
pine
and
lots
of
alcohol
apricots
mangos
and
other
citrusy
fruits
there
is
some
hop
bitterness
maybe
in
a
pine
flavor
but
not
as
much
as
i
expected
medium
body
low
carbonation
did
not
seem
to
be
15
abv
as
others
have
noted
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
not
as
over
the
top
as
i
thought
and
maybe
a
little
disappointing
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
silky
with
very
little
carbonation
very
big
bodied
and
mouthcoating
finish
is
smooth
and
like
creamy
caramey
with
a
tinge
of
piney
hops
this
certainly
doent
taste
like
a
15
beer
alcohol
is
too
well
hidden
this
is
dangerous
and
delicious
one
of
the
best
aged
barleywines
iv
had
this
is
an
easy
drinking
high
alcohol
brew
the
alcohol
is
well
balanced
and
sneaks
up
on
you
rather
quickly
pours
a
deep
gold
to
bronze
color
with
some
light
orange
highlights
active
light
beige
colored
head
stickily
malty
sweet
with
some
confectionary
nuances
come
through
at
times
sappy
hoppy
nose
among
the
all
the
nostril
burning
fusel
alcohols
whewee
this
is
strong
no
hiding
the
brandylike
burn
in
the
finish
i
little
sticky
upfront
the
transition
to
alcohol
burn
is
introduced
nicely
by
hoppy
dryness
seems
a
tad
bit
overcarbonated
with
its
champagney
mouthfeel
but
it
works
well
to
complement
the
high
alcohol
level
a
good
barleywine
but
too
robust
in
alcohol
and
not
in
the
other
areas
that
make
up
a
great
barleywine
a
big
and
boozy
example
of
a
barley
wine
it
had
a
lot
of
promise
i
really
wish
i
couldve
sat
on
it
for
a
while
longer
patience
is
something
i
lack
drinkability
come
on
now
its
15
to
put
it
into
perspective
its
like
filling
your
glass
with
12
oz
of
apple
pucker
yes
you
winced
and
you
should
have
however
this
isnt
apple
pucker
at
the
same
time
its
surely
not
something
to
mess
with
its
beer
indeed
but
some
have
said
it
has
the
more
qualities
in
line
with
a
brandy
or
bourban
and
to
a
certain
degree
i
agree
now
that
i
think
about
it
though
especially
if
youre
just
buying
a
4pack
because
since
its
a
seasonal
limited
dogfish
head
brew
it
comes
in
4packs
id
suggest
letting
it
rest
in
the
fridge
for
at
least
a
day
then
break
it
out
let
it
rest
outside
the
fridge
for
15
minutes
pour
it
into
a
glass
take
huge
whiffs
of
both
the
empty
bottle
right
after
poured
and
the
glass
right
after
its
filled
sip
slowly
and
enjoy
both
the
power
and
the
complex
tastes
and
aromas
hiding
this
much
alcohol
in
a
beer
is
quite
a
feat
i
could
drink
this
all
night
if
i
had
the
liver
of
10
men
a
decent
beer
overall
but
way
overpriced
at
almost
5
00
for
a
12oz
bottle
might
be
better
served
at
room
temperature
this
beer
reminded
me
a
lot
of
a
kicked
up
version
of
victory
golden
monkey
bender
wow
the
15
abv
is
well
hidden
i
can
honestly
see
myself
drinking
a
4
pack
and
waking
up
naked
in
the
front
yard
cudding
a
duck
this
one
is
an
orangishgolden
color
it
is
quite
opaque
for
its
color
there
is
very
little
white
head
to
it
which
drops
off
rather
quickly
very
potent
aroma
it
is
a
sweet
malt
with
fruity
nuances
a
hint
of
sourness
comes
up
also
the
taste
is
superb
quite
a
rich
taste
the
malts
are
strong
but
the
sweetness
is
diminished
i
get
a
bit
of
a
whisky
tinge
to
the
taste
it
does
not
come
through
as
an
alcohol
bite
as
some
do
in
fact
i
have
had
much
more
alcohol
taste
in
7
beers
than
this
this
is
really
superb
so
friggin
smooth
at
15
abv
youll
find
the
strength
of
this
beer
hard
to
believe
this
is
one
mastpiece
of
a
barelywine
impressed
worth
checking
out
nice
warmth
for
those
winter
nights
at
home
by
the
fire
the
alcohol
in
this
does
sneak
right
up
on
you
pours
a
clear
copper
which
is
almost
golden
when
held
up
to
a
light
there
is
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
with
good
lacing
aroma
is
very
candy
sweet
figs
plums
raspberry
and
strawberry
preserves
and
preserved
they
are
in
15
alcohol
the
taste
carrys
some
of
the
familiar
fruity
sweetness
from
the
nose
along
with
a
spicy
alcohol
interlude
which
reminds
you
to
show
respect
in
the
back
end
you
have
the
lovely
barley
taste
i
look
for
in
the
style
with
just
enough
hops
to
balance
the
whole
thing
out
i
was
honestly
expecting
a
hoppier
beer
because
its
from
dfh
and
its
another

although
i
would
guess
that
this
would
diminish
with
cellaring
white
head
a
slight
haze
is
notable
due
to
bottle
conditioning
an
intense
maltiness
and
alcohol
aroma
are
immediately
detectable
if
your
nose
is
anywhere
near
the
beer
the
smell
is
really
something

thick

with
a
richer
bouquet
of

aspects
which

alcohol
is
pretty
well

to
see
a

this
is

brew
was
brewed
in
june
and
bottled
in
sept
it
will
be
released

bombers
beige
in

a
little
hops
in
the
back
of
the
nose
smooth
silky
fruity
taste
figs
with
lots
of
malt
in
your
mouth
thick
and
fruity
this
brew
has
a
big
bold
finish
not
as
dry
on
the
tongue
as
many
other
bws
ive
tasted
the
brew
does
numb
the
tongue
i
think
this
will
greatly
improve
with
more
time
in
the
bottle
a
review
edit
will
be
done
as
i
cellar
one
of
these
for
next
year
overall
dark
brown

thin
tan
head
aroma
of
raisins
malt
and
booze
taste
is
boozy
malty
dried
prunes
raisins
and
molasses
finish
is
hint
of
bitter
and
caramel
strong
carmel
flavors
bit
different
barley
wine
not
as
good
as
their
other
barley
wine
not
my
thing
and
def
to
old
big
and
bold
with
smooth
caramel
malts
all
over
warming
well
crafted
and
easy
drinking
well
worth
a
try
great
on
a
winters
night
o
ive
had
this
fresh
but
it
is
much
better
after
sitting
two
years
this
is
easily
the
best
barleywine
brewed
in
wi
i
prefer
it
over
bbbw
it
ages
masterfully
and
i
wish
i
had
more
bottles
o
since
ive
had
a
few
vintage
of
cws
barleywine
i
have
been
wanting
to
go
to
this
one
for
a
comparison
i
feel
like
i
get
the
lineage
now
serving
type
bottle
i
feel
like
my
opinion
runs
against
what
most
people
think
about
this
one
i
just
didnt
enjoy
it
all
that
much
final
score
3
95
tried
a
glass
of
the
y2k
and
a
glass
of
the
bbbw
at
the
brewery
both
are
great
i
think
i
prefer
the
bbbw
version
more
but
the
regular
y2k
is
much
easier
to
drink
and
you
notice
the
sweetness
more
very
sweet
bread
like
aroma
taste
is
very
smooth
lots
of
sweetness
some
caramel
notes
some
fruit
overall
a
great
beer
o
a
great
american
barleywine
with
lots
of
big
flavors
and
feel
ranks
with
the
best
out
there
not
to
be
passed
up
on
pour
is
a
hazy
dark
chestnut
with
a
very
tight
tan
head
nose
is
heavy
caramel
malt
and
pungent
crystal
malt
with
a
fair
bit
of
cardboard
like
oxidation
taste
follows
suit
heavy
dry
caramel
very
sticky
a
bit
of
crystal
malt
and
a
good
bit
of
cardboard
oxidation
in
back
with
a
hint
of
green
apple
skin
full
bodied
and
chewy
prickly
feel
and
well
carbonated
i
did
enjoy
this
as
my
first
barley
wine
style
ale
ive
consumed
it
sparked
and
interest
in
me
to
buy
more
barely
wines
o
this
beer
develops
nice
flavors
as
it
warms
up
and
the
alcohol
is
relatively
well
masked
from
the
taste
at
10
the
alcohol
essence
is
well
in
check
this
is
a
superb
example
of
the
style
kosmyk
charlies
y2k
catastrophe
ale
pours
a
hazyish
dark
amber
color
with
a
very
small
non
lacing
head
there
is
a
bold
oaky
earthy
sharp
aroma
the
taste
is
very
sharp
big
oaky
flavors
and
strong
earthy
notes
good
flavors
flat
body
even
for
a
barley
wine
overall
its
very
strong
and
earthy
with
some
big
oak
notes
o
perfect
example
of
an
americanenglish
bw
love
the
ba
version
and
cant
wait
for
more
of
this
overall
not
really
much
to
say
besides
the
little
blurb
with
which
i
started
the
review
this
is
an
almost
perfected
american
barleywine
great
stuff
overall
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
way
too
boozey
but
the
taste
is
actually
very
well
balanced
with
caramel
and
hops
in
the
end
i
generally
have
issues
with
this
style
but
the
medium
plus
malt
backbone
helps
this
beer
out
definitely
for
those
into
a
bigger
more
robust
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
mouthfeel
is
good
smooth
thick
mildly
carbonated
perfect
sipping
beer
an
excellent
example
of
an
american
barleywine
i
like
it
plenty
fresh
and
i
am
sure
with
age
the
beer
will
evolve
and
maybe
improve
overall
i
did
not
expect
the
notes
of
cherries
this
is
what
imo
differentiated
from
other
barleywines
cw
sure
does
pull
of
a
unique
barleywine
glad
to
try
this
o
a
big
beer
to
say
the
least
central
waters
kosmyk
charlies
y2k
catastrophe
ale
balances
a
rich
and
complex
englishstyle
barleywine
malt
profile
that
explores
bread
slices
and
sweet
confections
with
that
of
a
hoppy
american
barleywine
the
result
is
an
absolutely
lovely
highoctane
brew
that
will
without
a
doubt
sustain
anyone
through
the
apocalypse
be
sure
to
stock
up
i
love
these
guys
now
up
from
one
of
my
top
5
to
top
3
favorite
breweries
of
all
time
the
appearance
on
this
beer
is
awesome
half
inch
creamy
khaki
head
and
a
deep
brownish
crimson
color
that
is
very
appealing
when
held
up
to
the
light
smells
very
sweet
and
malty
hints
of
honey
and
nuttiness
the
flavor
profile
on
this
beer
is
intense
perhaps
i
should
have
given
this
one
a
few
months
to
age
and
tame
a
bit
yowser
i
get
an
onslaught
of
everything
i
picked
up
in
the
aroma
the
sweet
maltiness
the
subtle
honeynut
flavor
and
some
pretty
strong
carameliness
which
i
love
this
is
one
rich
beast
i
think
i
would
have
given
this
a
perfect
5
in
taste
had
i
aged
it
a
bit
im
definitely
going
to
pick
up
a
few
more
of
these
and
cellar
them
mouthfeel
is
a
little
high
in
carbonation
for
my
liking
in
this
style
like
medium
high
not
a
silky
on
the
tongue
as
i
would
like
either
one
of
the
better
examples
ive
had
of
this
style

a
nice
finger

that
is
light
brown
in
color
smell
is
dark
grains
in
the
forefront
pretty
earthy
seems
to
be
a
little
hops
in
the
background
but
nothing
fruity
more
something
to
balance
the
beer
out
taste
is
definitely
some
dark
grains
burnt
sugar
burnt
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
in
the
back
to
balance
things
out
a
little
it
tastes
really
earthy
like
the
nose
i
really
dont
get
any
booze
from
this
but
i
seem
to
need
a
little
more
booze
it
seems
to
taste
it
than
others
mouthfeel
is
medium
thickmaybe
a
little
thicker
from
the
amount
of
carbonation
overall
its
a
great
barleywhine
that
is
not
sweet
at
all
there
is
absolutely
no
sweetness
which
is
different
for
your
typical
beer
of
this
style
i
like
it
and
would
buy
it
again
overall
another
excellent
beer
from
central
waters
this
just
came
out
and
i
will
be
excited
to
pick
up
some
more
for

good
things
about

of
figs
plums
caramel

and
even
a
bit
of
bourbon

a
hint
of
some

yum
creamy
and

with
plenty

very
nice
beer
and
only
my
2nd
from

can
definitely
see
this
turning
out
beautifully

if

this
stuff

the

comprises
sye
bread
sweet
caramel
light
toffee
mild
rum
light
fig
light
raisin
light
candied
orange
peel
and
a
strong
boozy
backdrop
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
bread
coming
through
a
bit
stronger
the
candied
fruit
as
well
and
the
booze
hanging
around
long
enough
to
have
its
presence
felt
with
every
sip
luckily
its
somehow
not
overpowering
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
drying
finish
overall
a
solid
strong
bwine
something
i
could
easily
see
being
used
as
a
body
warmer
in
the
dead
of

this
was
stellar
and
hits
all
the

worth
checking

poured
out
as
a
nice
amber

with
a
decent
white

on

the

also
loaded
with
toasted

its
piney

this
beer
is

i
can

the

on

futily
through
the

a
decent
beer
overall
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
barrelaged
version
worth
a
try
still
to
see
what
the
base
is
all
about
this
is
ultimately
a
solid
effort
and
definitely
worth
a
try

with
much
thanks
to
ba
grancty
o
nice
barleywine
that
should
age
well
but
i
dont
think
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
lets
see
what
putting
this
baby
in
bourbon
barrels
for
a
while
did
3
5
o
i
enjoyed
this
take
on
the
american
barleywine
style
i
liked
that
it
wasnt
overridden
with
hops
but
focused
more
on
balance
the
vanilla
tones
lended
great
complexity
and
hops
met
the
alcohol
head
on
highly
recommended
bwine
nicely
drinkable
especially
for
the
price
fantastic
central
waters
is
extremely
underrated
so
much
flavor
in
this
one
o
i
am
very
new
to
the
barleywine
seen
but
this
is
a
delicious
offering
with
a
year
on
this
particular
bottle
things
seem
to
be
very
well
balance
huge
malt
sweetness
strong
booze
and
still
has
a
nice
hop
backbone
unfortunately
i
only
have
one
more
bottle
in
the
cellar
but
hopefully
i
can
get
back
to
the
local
shop
to
get
some
more
cant
wait
to
see
what
a
few
more
years
of
aging
would
do
albeit
im
a
novice
in
the
barleywine
genera
but
i
highly
recommend
o
this
is
my
first
offering
by
cw
and
i
must
say
that
this
is
quite
nice
i
honestly
wish
the
grassy
notes
were
dialed
back
a
bit
because
it
really
starts
to
come
out
as
the
beer
approaches
room
temp
further
creating
and
imbalance
as
far
as
4
goes
i
think
this
shoud
sit
around
1518
a
4
pk
i
got
it
for
20
so
in
my
honest
opinion
its
above
its
calling
card
paired
with
super
mario
bros
wiiu
overall
an
awesome
barleywine
quite
dry
with
great
bitterness
but
not
overwhealming
in
the
hop
flavours
thanks
again
steasy66
o
im
not
very
well
versed
in
the
barleywine
style
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
a
really
well
balanced
offering
of
some
dank
vegetal
hops
and
sweet
malts
central
waters
is
a
great
brewery
and
i
will
continue
to
seek
out
there
beers
o
a
great
tasting
and
feeling
barlewine
abv
is
somewhat
hidden
i
love
the
ba
version
of
this
and
it
was
nice
to
try
the
base
beer
overall
barley
wines
are
far
from
my
style
but
this
is
my
favorite
to
date
it
has
a
nice
sweetnes
but
the
booze
smoke
and
hop
finish
is
somewhat
off
putting
for
me
i
know
if
you
are
a
barley
wine
fan
you
will
definitly
enjoy
much
more
malt
centric
on
the
palate
sweet
dessert
flavors
some
overripe
fruit
caramel
malt
a
boozy
sting
on
the
tail
end
good
stuff
id
still
love
to
track
down
the
barrel
aged
version
overall
a
damn
good
barleywine
but
not
as
good
as
the
barrel
aged
version
m
full
bodied
chewy
as
hell
o
a
pretty
good
american
barleywine
even
with
some
age
on
it
zac16125
o
a
decent
bw
a
bit
heavy
on
the
astringency
and
the
burnt
flavor
is
somewhat
distracting
but
overall
fairly
drinkable
with
a
good
range
of
flavors
o
almost
used
big
for
a
third
time
to
lead
off
a
description
this
is
a
big
smooth
easy
drinkin
barleywine
im
generally
not
a
huge
barleywine
fan
but
this
one
is
most
excellent
this
was
a
big
beer
very
roasty
for
a
barleywine
toffee
caramel
alcohol
almost
a
very
burnt
popcorn
taste
in
a
good
way
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
love
to
try
the
ba
version
it
is
definitely
a
sipper
though
and
it
would
be
dificult
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
o
tasty
and
certainly
worth
a
try
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
one
o
this
is
actually
a
really
good
beer
i
loved
the
barrel
aged
version
and
this
is
just
as
good
the
stouts
were
a
bit
of
a
disspointment
but
this
is
great
great
job
cw
keep
it
up
o
while
i
expected
a
bit
sweeter
beer
due
to
the
reviews
before
me
i
think
this
is
a
good
representation
of
an
american
barleywine
central
waters
does
not
dissapoint
once
again
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
o
good
american
barleywine
i
think
i
preferred
this
one
slightly
more
on
the
fresh
end
o
a
very
tasty
barleywine
but
definitely
one
that
could
use
some
time
to
mellow
my
only
concern
would
be
that
out
could
get
a
little
too
one
sided
with
the
sweet
malts
would
drink
again
but
the
ba
version
is
way
better
overall
another
awesome
brew
by
cw
a
little
bit
stronger
in
the
spectrum
of
barley
wines
but
the
huge
caramel
flavors
make
it
unique
enough
to
stand
out
looking
forward
to
see
how
it
ages
o
one
of
the
better
aged
barleywines
that
ive
had
lots
of
complexity
and
depth
hard
to
find
much
wrong
with
it
o
this
is
a
great
beer
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
but
considering
the
barrel
aged
version
is
not
hard
to
come
by
and
the
cost
is
the
same
i
would
go
with
barrel
aged
every
time
o
i
will
be
revisiting
this
one
very
good
fuller
body
somewhat
milder
carbonation
creamy
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
a
nice
barleywine
with
a
definite
sense
of
age
to
it
not
quite
great
though
do
recognizable
as
a
barleywine
though
not
particularly
memorable
or
even
appealing
this
beer
fails
to
advance
beyond
mediocrity
bitterness
is
the
single
least
appealing
quality
bracing
in
its
intensity
yet
uninteresting
in
its
lack
of
associated
qualities
this
beer
does
not
deliver
the
decadent
experience
that
a
barleywine
ought
to
overall
a
decent
barleywine
not
fantastic
but
good
a
pretty
basic
and
a
bit
boring
barleywine
a
solid
rather
malty
barleywine
i
wish
the
bitterness
didnt
kick
in
so
quickly
in
the
taste
but
can
i
really
complain
its
a
good
beer
and
one
of
the
better
balanced
straightup
barleywines
ive
had
im
enjoying
it
more
as
i
get
further
down
the
glass
but
maybe
thats
the
alcohol
talking
already
light
tan
head
piled
high
from
a
high
pour
over
a
hazy
dark
copper
ale
high
alcohol
10
floats
above
strong
dark
fruit
raisin
fig
with
significant
floral
hop
over
top
slightly
burnt
malt
with
oak
continued
over
fig
dark
fruit
that
fueled
by
alcohol
hotness
says
aged
for
a
year
on
the
website
but
doesnt
say
how
or
in
what
guessing
straight
oak
barrels
because
there
seems
to
be
wood
but
not
added
whiskey
or
other
flavor
sweet
and
pungent
off
the
back
rough
and
raw
flavor
thats
fun
to
drink
but
lacks
a
certain
elegance
o
a
decent
and
drinkable
barleywine
both
bitter
and
sweet
throughout
o
this
barleywine
is
vary
drinkable
almost
sessionable
haha
if
that
were
even
possible
for
barleywines
it
is
really
a
beautiful
beer
in
terms
of
color
and
appearance
a
great
barley
wine
i
would
highly
recommend
this
too
friends
who
are
new
to
the
style
besides
the
tiny
kick
at
the
end
that
it
gives
which
is
hardly
noticeable
this
is
an
absolutely
perfect
beer
cost
3
99
for
a
single
bottle
or
11
99
for
a
four
pack
this
is
a
pretty
good
barleywine
the
label
says
it
is
aged
at
the
brewery
for
a
year
before
release
i
believe
them
both
the
smell
and
taste
remind
me
of
bigfoot
with
a
year
or
two
on
itnot
a
lot
of
hops
and
more
sweetness
and
fruit
flavors
d
overall
a
solid
barleywine
i
can
see
how
this
becomes
the
surperior
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
malty
and
sweet
but
balanced
and
smooth
too
the
hop
level
is
quite
high
though
i
think
this
would
benefit
from
some
extended
time
full
thickness
syrupy
light
carbonation
towards
the
back
quarter
of
it
sticky
biting
bitterness
combining
with
hot
sometimes
cloying
alcohol
very
powerful
very
sweet
very
hopped
very
hot
an
exceptional
barleywine
from
a
jewel
of
midwest
brewing
the
pour
produces
a
ruddy
reddish
brown
liquid
with
a
haze
produced
by
tiny
particles
suspended
manna
in
the
heaven
that
is
this
brew
an
even
blanket
of
manila
foam
tops
the
beer
with
lacing
that
is
spotty
but
clings
modestly
like
barnacles
on
a
ships
hull
the
aroma
is
rich
and
decadent
buttery
raisin
studded
spice
cake
doused
in
rum
and
orange
liqueur
the
flavor
follows
the
smell
but
with
a
bracing
bitterness
cloves
and
orange
flavored
dark
chocolate
is
interwoven
in
the
intense
hoppiness
more
butter
and
cream
notes
add
to
the
endless
complexity
and
decadence
of
the
palate
a
unique
delicious
beer
spectacular
o
this
beer
is
just
straight
up
awesome
far
better
than
i
was
expecting
needless
to
say
i
not
only
would
try
it
again
im
stocking
up
like
it
was
bottled
water
on
the
eve
of
the
zombie
apocalypse
weirdly
im
not
sure
ive
had
a
straightup
barleywine
in
a
while
i
dont
know
why
this
is
a
good
solid
barleywine
more
drinkable
than
complex
session
barleywine
hell
yeah
o
i
liked
this
beer
but
the
citrus
punch
through
me
just
a
bit
think
i
will
enjoy
this
beer
even
more
next
time
knowing
what
to
expect
d
this
one
is
pretty
complex
and
definitely
a
sipper
the
abv
isnt
too
noticeable
except
for
a
warmth
in
the
throat
d
and
o
really
enjoyable
barleywine
one
of
my
personal
favorites
and
its
a
great
price
point
central
waters
really
puts
out
some
nice
products
o
this
might
be
the
cheapest
barleywine
around
and
its
certainly
not
the
worst
or
even
close
really
not
my
favorite
by
any
means
but
loads
of
flavor
and
a
terrific
value
pours
a
brownish
caramel
color
with
a
nice
creamy
head
on
it
the
nose
consists
of
vanilla
and
some
sticky
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
the
nose
in
liquid
form
caramel
malts
move
to
vanilla
flavors
sweet
up
front
some
resinous
piney
hops
move
in
to
balance
the
sweetness
and
round
off
the
barleywine
profile
the
mouth
is
a
little
thin
but
still
pretty
good
this
is
a
solid
barleywine
with
good
complexity
recommended
overall
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
had
need
to
try
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
one
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
fresh
american
barleywines
that
i
have
had
drinks
great
with
great
flavor
cant
wait
to
get
my
mitts
on
the
barrel
aged
version
o
barelywines
are
something
i
enjoy
infrequently
because
they
are
typically
boozing
and
so
damn
big
though
y2k
certainly
fits
into
this
description
it
retains
a
nice
drinkability
mainly
because
of
its
dryness
the
lingering
hop
bitterness
detracts
somewhat
from
what
is
overall
a
good
beer
o
a
pretty
simple
barleywine
a
good
example
of
the
style
although
the
taste
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
smell
even
the
label
says
this
has
been
aged
for
a
year
the
hop
bitterness
is
unfortunately
still
there
the
flavor
is
mostly
sweet
it
has
a
nice
caramel
earthiness
with
some
bitterness
enough
hops
for
it
to
be
nicely
balanced
not
too
boozy
but
it
is
there
do
very
solid
barleywine
from
central
waters
the
whole
time
i
was
drinking
this
i
thought
this
would
be
a
great
candidate
for
barrel
aging
go
figure
hah
thanks
a
ton
brian
4daloveofstout
for
headin
up
to
cheeseheadville
to
snatch
this
up
for
me
overall
this
barleymine
is
tasty
but
it
almost
reminds
me
of
a
quad
i
still
liked
it
but
this
is
not
a
super
sweet
malt
bomb
barleywine
i
think
that
its
a
nice
sipper
beer
and
some
age
will
do
this
beer
some
good
overall
a
really
excellent
barleywine
unlike
most
barleywines
that
are
fresh
this
beer
is
very
balanced
i
realize
it
ages
for
a
year
before
they
release
it
and
that
helps
let
the
bitterness
fall
out
with
some
additional
aging
this
will
be
a
fantastic
barleywine

edit
had
a
2011
and
2012
bottle
side
by
side
tonight
there
wasnt
a
huge
difference
between
the
two
but
when
i
did
a
blind
taste
test
of
each
i
was
able
to
tell
which
one
was
which
the
2011
has
slightly
less
alcohol
burn
and
the
smell
is
much
richer
thanks
to
seeswo
for
the
trade
2011
vintage
i
think
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
old
stock
snifter
pours
a
semihazy
mahogany
with
a
loose
quarter
inch
creamcolored
head
that
quickly
dissipates
forming
a
frothy
band
around
the
edges
and
an
oily
slick
across
the
surface
some
spots
of
lacing
are
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
expresses
toffee
a
suggestion
of
milk
chocolate
an
earthy
quality
and
a
trace
of
booze
taste
follows
nose
with
the
addition
of
faint
citrus
notes
and
some
hops
bittering
that
comes
out
in
the
middle
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
in
consistency
with
an
even
carbonation
and
a
slight
acidity
theres
also
a
little
residual
alcohol
heat
but
nothing
significant
overall
a
solid
american
barleywine
with
good
aging
potential
having
just
had
the
ba
version
of
this
beer
i
have
to
say
that
the
barrel
aging
does
a
lot
for
this
beer
o
not
as
good
as
the
world
famous
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
but
still
pretty
nice
all
in
all
wow
amazing
brew
with
a
complex
and
interesting
flavor
profile
maybe
this
just
hits
all
the
notes
im
looking
for
in
a
barleywine
but
this
one
blows
me
away
thick
brown
though
you
can
see
some
light
through
it
no
head
and
a
nice
lace
top
it
off
smell
is
hopped
for
sure
but
with
a
subtle
sugary
undertone
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
too
taste
is
not
very
strong
at
all
there
is
the
natural
piney
hoppness
you
would
expect
from
a
barley
wine
but
not
too
strong
there
is
also
a
sugary
nuttiness
about
it
as
well
the
alcohol
is
there
and
that
keeps
this
a
sipper
it
is
actually
nicely
carbonated
and
not
harsh
going
down
has
the
warm
feeling
on
the
way
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
i
would
not
mind
having
another
and
certainly
kept
me
warm
this
evening
o
this
was
a
surprisingly
good
treat
that
is
an
easy
drinking
barleywine
with
a
good
flavor
profile
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
thick
body
light
carbonation
overall
a
great
barleywine
that
i
can
highly
recommend
pretty
tasty
and
complex
but
a
touch
too
boozy
i
would
probably
appreciate
this
more
in
the
winter
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
fell
a
little
too
far
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
it
did
had
a
very
interesting
juicy
flavor
to
it
with
some
orange
juice
like
qualities
which
i
liked
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
balance
for
me
though
interesting
beer
and
a
decent
one
to
drink
this
evening
but
not
quite
an
outstanding
one
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
good
people
much
better
than
the
2007
big
foot
i
had
imho
4
0
d
overall
a
very
nice
brew
i
think
this
is
the
base
beer
for
the
bbbw
which
i
absolutely
love
anyway
good
throughout
with
no
weaknesses
quite
good
and
only
improved
by
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
most
of
the
success
of
central
waters
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
starts
here
impression
in
an
era
of
absolutely
killer
american
barleywines
this
one
is
not
top
of
the
pile
but
an
absolute
taste
treat
in
its
own
right
wish
i
could
get
more
of
this
advice
do
what
it
takes
to
get
this
d
despite
the
boozy
nature
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
had
a
bottle
in
my
fridge
for
quite
some
time
and
did
not
have
it
labelled
so
i
dont
know
what
year
this
was
i
have
a
lot
to
learn
from
some
of
my
beer
cellaring
friends
a
very
solid
american
barleywine
from
central
waters
a
must
try
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
overall
i
was
impressed
glad
i
was
able
to
find
it
on
my
trip
to
madison
this
past
summer
so
far
central
waters
has
yet
to
let
me
down
d
this
is
a
complex
beer
that
is
best
enjoyed
sipped
i
wish
i
had
one
of
these
for
every
night
of
winter
i
am
assuming
that
this
beer
is
pretty
hot
fresh
but
i
wont
know
until
they
release
it
again
this
year
poured
into
a
snifter
color
is
amber
with
some
reddish
hues
throughout
slight
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
nose
is
really
quite
nice
with
cherries
dark
fruits
citrus
plum
skin
and
some
sweet
bread
taste
is
cherries
sweet
malt
hints
of
booze
and
a
thy
amount
of
citrus
zest
good
feel
with
excellent
drinkability
its
no
surprise
that
bbbw
has
such
a
fantastic
base
the
drinkability
is
a
little
lower
although
it
drinks
well
for
10
but
with
some
of
the
sticky
syrupy
feels
and
quite
a
bit
of
sweetness
take
away
a
bit
from
it
good
solid
taste
can
really
get
the
barley
in
there
i
didnt
really
pick
up
on
a
lot
of
different
tastes
but
a
really
soild
full
taste
d
easy
to
finish
and
im
very
glad
this
one
found
its
way
into
my
cooler
something
ill
try
to
sniff
out
up
north
this
winter
if
i
get
the
chance
this
one
seems
like
it
would
age
like
the
best
of
them
overall
this
is
a
solid
barleywine
and
worth
having
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
it
is
drinkable
but
the
abv
is
well
enough
hidden
to
warrant
some
caution
as
it
is
well
balanced
and
smooth
to
drink
d
delish
easy
to
drink
i
probably
could
drink
a
few
of
these
which
judging
by
the
abv
may
not
be
a
good
thing
depending
on
how
you
look
at
it
ha
dfriggin
great
so
happy
we
stumbled
upon
this
one
i
expected
much
harsher
but
its
delic
mfd
smooth
with
a
clean
finish
for
the
alc
very
subtle
carbonation
that
leaves
a
slight
warmth
in
the
back
of
the
throat
drinkability
is
nice
all
and
all
a
good
barley
wine
that
seems
a
little
harsh
at
the
moment
some
time
the
cellar
could
really
improve
this
one
poured
lovely
deep
prune
and
mahogany
amber
with
a
nicely
retaining
animal
cracker
head
exceptional
clarity
and
brilliance
i
get
lots
of
dark
fruits
raisins
currants
and
a
tiny
hint
of
plum
with
a
touch
of
carob
and
caramel
very
mild
earthy
hops
barely
noticeable
flavor
is
very
much
like
the
aromas
but
with
a
little
more
caramel
sweetness
spiced
rum
finish
nicely
carbonated
with
a
rich
body
i
wish
i
had
more
than
1
bottle
drinkability
is
good
with
little
alcohol
evidence
d
once
this
beer
warms
the
drinkability
is
quite
high
for
a
barleywine
this
isnt
quite
high
on
my
list
as
the
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
but
its
nothing
to
rag
on
either
if
this
had
a
fuller
flavor
it
would
be
right
there
with
the
bbbw
but
as
it
currently
stands
its
another
solid
offering
from
central
waters
keep
releasing
barleywines
i
will
be
the
first
one
banging
down
the
door
to
try
them
feels
smooth
creamy
and
it
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
properly
carbonated
medium
to
full
bodied
even
though
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
it
does
not
hinder
the
drinkabilityl
highly
recommended
pours
a
dark
red
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
dark
fruit
caramel
malt
sugar
and
some
alcohol
the
flavor
is
caramel
toffee
brown
sugar
alcohol
and
dark
fruit
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
big
flavor
to
this
barleywine
as
aggressive
leafy
bittering
hops
grab
the
front
of
the
tongue
and
slap
it
with
a
syrupy
pinyness
the
hoppy
assault
doesnt
end
there
it
merely
becomes
reinforced
by
a
tangy
booze
presence
midpalate
as
both
hops
and
alcohol
battle
it
out
through
the
finish
underneath
it
all
but
wholly
overshadowed
by
the
pinebooze
combo
are
subtle
tasty
notes
of
english
toffee
and
caramel
malts
tropical
fruit
pine
sap
and
cough
medicine
linger
into
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
thick
and
on
the
high
end
of
the
carbonation
spectrum
for
the
style
all
in
all
though
this
is
a
great
version
of
an
american
barleywine
reminds
me
a
lot
of
bigfoot
but
with
slightly
more
complexity
not
quite
sure
where
all
the
cellaraged
smoothness
described
on
the
label
is
hiding
but
ill
forgive
central
waters
this
time
grab
a
y2k
when
you
can
and
give
it
a
try
highly
recommended
good
but
some
age
will
make
this
one
much
better
perhaps
this
one
should
not
have
sit
so
long
in
the
bourbon
barrels
it
was
aged
in
the
best
straight
american
barleywine
ive
ever
had
i
really
wish
this
wasnt
my
last
bottle
its
held
up
so
well
and
its
going
down
way
too
fast
central
waters
continues
to
impress
i
havent
had
a
bad
beer
from
them
yet
honestly
ive
been
superimpressed
with
every
one
ive
tried
thus
far
kosmyk
charlies
y2k
catastrophe
ale
is
a
damn
good
barleywine
its
very
solid
in
all
respects
im
curious
as
to
what
a
fresh
bottle
tastes
like
perhaps
the
hops
would
be
a
little
more
prominent
this
bottle
with
a
little
time
behind
it
has
come
together
nicely
ive
really
enjoyed
it
highly
recommended
if
you
have
the
opportunity
thanks

booze
and
light

is
loaded
weith
bitter

balanced
by
a

maple
and
brown
sugar
comes
out
as
it
warms
sticky
viscous
and
sweet
but
theres
a
light
chalkiness
on
the
finish
that
turns
it
slightly
dry
this
is
very
similar
to
fresh
bigfoot
extremely
warming
on
the
way
down
wow
im
really
glad
i
have
one
more
bottle
of
this
to
see
how
it
ages
i
would
love
to
do
a
side
by
side
with
the
ng
iced
barleywine
a
year
or
two
from
now
for
a
good
ol
wisconsin
tasteoff
d
a
awfully
malty
and
sweet
date
like
brew
that
i
would
imagine
would
mellow
with
age

might
actually
prefer
this
fresh
over

but
it
has
not
been
ruined
by
the
years
and
so
apparently
stores
well
at

d
definitely
a
sipper
of
a
beer
strong

keep
this
from

for

would
be

good
barleywine
overall
this
beer
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
the
head
is
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
leaving
sticky
lacing
along
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
burnt
caramel
caramel
toffee
and
hints
of
chocolate
nice
complexity
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
it
is
listed
here
as
being
an
american
barleywine
but
i
think
it
drinks
much
more
like
an
english
barleywine
either
way
it
drinks
great
pours
deep
copper
with
light
tan
head
nice
aroma
with
tasty
wood
and
bourbon
notes
that
dont
really
over
shadow
the
fruity
esters
and
faint
maltiness
the
alcohol
heat
does
build
up
and
singe
the
nose
a
bit
the
taste
starts
with
mildly
sweet
maltiness
and
roasty
malts
that
then
becomes
wood
and
barrel
like
flavors
before
a
formidable
vanilla
flavor
takes
hold
theres
also
dark
fruity
esters
of
grapes
cherries
and
prunes
before
the
alcohol
hotness
builds
to
a
distracting
level
it
could
use
more
age
darn
tasty
now
though
central
waters
blows
this
one
out
of
the
water
this
is
amazing
second
only
to
their
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
nice
work
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
good
carbonation
and
a
tannish
head
nose
is
lighter
with
lots
of
sugar
moalsses
and
fruits
taste
is
very
syrupy

is

indeed
dried

drinkability

decent
drinkability
for
the
abv
and
style
really
sweet
and
has
a
lot
of
oaky
flavors
and
smell
drinkability
i
perhaps
did
the
bbw
and
the
y2k
in
the
wrong
order
or
perhaps
i
should
have
done
them
side
by
side
or
something
my
point
is
that
i
would
have
enjoyed
to
compare
these
two
beyond
a
comparison
of
my
reviews
this
beer
is
a
solid
drinkable
barleywine
with
a
complex
surprisingly
wellbalanced
flavor
profile
reasonably
wellhidden
alcohol
and
a
mouthfeel
to
die
for
that
one
was
well
all
that
plus
some
i
suppose
both
are
amazing
beers
and
id
be
lucky
to
cellar
either
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
d
not
super
drinkable
due
to
the
bite
from
the
malt
and
slight
alcohol
flavor
they
can
be
a
little
fatiguing
over
time
however
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
so
that
keeps
the
score
higher
central
waters
has
one
heck
of
a
keeper
of
a
barleywine
that
really
seems
more
like
an
ole
ale
of
the
aged
j
w
lees
harvest
ale
kind
of
thing
remarkably
yummy
stuff
pours
a
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
about
a
finger
of
head
that
recedes
but
doesnt
disappear
smells
is
dark
fruits
like
sticking
a
plum
up
your
nostril
floral
hops
and
sweet
candy
help
make
for
a
true
sensory
experience
the
taste
almost
has
a
chocolate
undertone
although
it
is
really
tough
to
distinguish
flavors
when
you
have
as
many
things
going
on
as
this
one
does
caramel
rock
candy
hops
milk
chocolate
marshmallows
pure
vanilla
extract
oak
this
is
a
great
beer
for
sure
medium
to
full
bodied
and
extremely
smooth
and
creamy
definitely
a
sipper
but
it
sure
is
a
delightful
one
taste
is
more
sherry
like
aged
qualities
and
some
more
dark
fruit
im
really
digging
this
aged
barleywine
very
smooth
with
light
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
im
not
a
huge
barleywine
fine
but
this
is
just
the
way
i
like
them
very
good
i
have
one
more
in
the
cellar
but
i
dont
think
this
one
needs
to
much
more
time
pours
a
rusty
cedar
with
a
silky
tan
head
and
nice
lacing
nose
has
floral
hops
figs
cherries
caramel

toffee
taste
has
vanilla
dark
candy
ripe
pitted
fruits
and
rich
creamy

carbonated

excellent
barleywine

d
barleywines
come
and
go
with
me
sometimes
i
think
theyre
amazing
other
times
i
find
them
a
chore
to
finish
this
one
was
a
pleasure
with
a
smoothnessmellowness
that
i
sometimes
cant
find
in
the
style
good
aroma
and
flavor
too
id
have
it
again
and
wouldnt
mind
putting
one
or
two
in
the

a

wouldnt
call
it
an
alltime
great
but
on
the
upper
level
this
may
be
one
of
the
most
underrated
breweries
in
the
country
i
cant
remember
having
anything
other
than
good
beer
from
them
despite
abv
this
drinks
very
well
nice
fruityslightly
piney
touch
along
with
the
carameltoffee
that
lingers
a
very
enjoyable
solidly
american
barleywine
d
well
not
too
high
in
general
but
for
a
barley
wine
its
pretty
darn
good
pretty
good
version
of
an
american
barleywine
since
i
usually
dont
care
much
for
the
huge
hops
in
them
this
one
is
a
bit
more
complex
though
with
lots
of
deep
malt
flavors
if
it
wasnt
so
bitter
it
would
be
even
better
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
pretty
good
barley
wine
lots
of
great
flavors
and
an
awesome
aroma
again
if
it
was
slightly
less
sweet
i
would
like
it
a
little
better
but
still
a
great
beer
drinkability
for
a
10
abv
beer
its
pretty
darned
good
must
be
because
it
is
so
damn
tasty
eh
well
done
central
waters
considering
the
weight
this
is
very
drinkable
could
have
another
if
available
i
will
be
seeking
this
out
again
in
wi
hope
more
is
out
there
d
one
of
the
best
bwines
ive
tried
in
a
while
stellar
stuff
my
first
from
central
waters
d
surprising
considering
the
abv
heather
thought
there
was
excellent
balance
between
the
sweet
and
spicy
i
agree

microbrewery
ovr
im
not
a
huge
barlywine
fan
but
this
is
pobably
the
bet
ive
had
it
was
just
perfectly
in
balance
nothing
getting
out
of
whack
the
hops
just
encroaching
on
too
much
and
then
fading
the
malt
laying
down

a

time
in

cellar
this
one
would
be
pretty
awesome
im
already
a
huge
fan
of
their
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
and
i
think
with
time
this
could
approach
the
same
level
still
its
pretty
nice
even
now
d
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
it
had
some
nice
complex
flavors
notes
from
82007
d
very
nice
barleywine
strong
powerful
and
full
of
flavor
not
a
beer
for
the
fainthearted
at
all
this
could
have
solved
any
y2k
problem
d
the
barleywine
is
big
so
big
that
more
than
one
bottle
could
be
dangerous
i
have
one
bottle
left
that
im
saving
for
a
horizontal
tasting
with
the
barrelaged
version

incredibly
drinkable

its

overall
its
a

if
a

onesided
on

this
is
really
one
that
would
mellow
with

and
be
very
tasty

the

complex
with
the

with

along
with
a
heavy

well
the

dry

super
malty
and
alcoholic
the
alcohol
and
malt
heaviness
take
away
from
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
not
sure
how
old
this
is
but
i
dont
find
the
alcohol
to
be
overpowering
i
think
it
melds
pretty
well
drinkability
not
as
graceful
as
some
of
the
finer

much

dont
let
my

it
dissuade
you
from
buying
it
just
dont
make
the
mistake
of
drinking
it
before
its
ready
it
pours
a
very
clear
deep
amber
color
with
very
little
head
my
first
impression
was
that
this
barleywine
leans
more
toward
the
sweet
side
than
the
hoppy
side
but
there
is
some
bitterness
in
there
and
its
not
extremely
malty
like
a
thomas
hardy
or
jw
lees
harvest
hmmm
maybe
this
bw
is
in
the
middle
i
often
prefer
hoppy
bws
but
i
thoroughly
enjoy
an
expertlybrewed
malty
version
as
well
whatever
the
case
hats
off
to
central

with
the
y2k
this
is
a
superb
brew
the
aroma
of
caramelized

is
incredible
the
taste
further
supports
the
aroma
im
not
getting

a
strong

instead
the
wonderful
clean

is
king
here
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
things
out
this
is
certainly
a
sipper
that
just
gets
better

thanks
daniel
excellent
beer
overall
everything
i
like
about
american
barleywines
reminds
me
a
whole
lot
of
a
2006
double
bastard
i
had
about
a
month
ago
im
really
looking
forward
to
trying
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
version
now
this
is
not
a
session
beer
for
me
i
will
have
it
again
but
probably
not
until
i
age
it
for
a
year
or
so
as
is
i
would
have
to
say
the
drinkability
is
pretty
low
for
me
very
raw
in
its
present
state
a
bit
thin
for
my
tastes
but
perhaps
with
time
the
true
flavor
will
shine
through
pretty
clear
deep
reddish
amber
colour
a
hard
pour
produced
a
thin
skim
of
fine
beige
bubbles
plus
a
solid
collar
it
looked
fairly
viscous
too
bubbles
were
a
bit
sticky
producing
some
spotty
lacing
fruity
citrus
hops
and
caramel
meld
well
in
the
aroma
notes
of
toffee
and
cotton
candy
maybe
a
bit
buttery
solid
bitterness
that
turns
a
bit
resinous
and
lingers
in
the
finish
as
it
warmed
this
became
more
of
a
light
herbal
hop
bitterness
heavy
malt
body
and
flavour
plenty
of
caramel
some
toffee
sweetness
a
bit
of
burnt
character
in
the
background
dried
fruits
and
raisins
add
complexity
brown
sugar
fruity
hops
carbonation
was
on
the
light
side
texture
was
good
just
short

sticky
with
very
mild
warmth
good
stuff
one
tries
to
sip
this
tasty
treat
but
youll
find
yourself
picking
up
the
glass
at
a
quick
pace
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
dangerous
combination
at
this
strength
i
could
see
y2k
being
a
better
place
with
a
case
or
2
of
this
in
the
cellar
this
is
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
im
glad
i
bought
four
of
these
so
that
i
can
store
them
for
future
indulgence
i
will
recommend
my
friends
give
kosmyk
charlie
a
try
but
i
wont
be
sharing
mine
sorry
guys
d
very
drinkable
and
the
10
abv
is
well
hidden
d
awesome
appearance
is
a
bright
ruby
red
with
a
tightly
packed
head
that
sticks
around
forever
aroma
is
very
sticksweet
hoppiness
with
some
citrus
notes
taste
is
alcohol
astringency
with
a
lot
of
alcohol
upfront
i
could
feel
its
warming
effect
with
my
first
sip
cheers
inital
toffee
caramel
sweetness
that
segues
into
seriously
bitter
hops
dryness
rides
out
into
a
long
finish
more
herbal
than
pine
juicy
not
too
fruity
though
some
peaty
smoke
and
toasted
malt
comes
out
in
the
aftertaste
mild
astringency
for
such
a
huge
behemoth
of
a
barleywine
it
doesnt
become
cloying
but
it
does
deserve
to
be
sipped
very
slowly
one
and
done
a
nice
nightcap
this
is
a
very
good
barley
wine
it
lacks
some
of
the
overpowering
meatiness
of
some
which
is
not
always
a
good
thing
but
in
this
case
it
makes
the
beer
a
good
alternative
when
youre
not
in
the
mood
to
be
overpowered
the
color
is
an
attractive
cherryish
red
and
the
aroma
has
some
nice
orange
peel
to
it
over
a
layer
of
maltiness
the
first
impression
is
of
fruity
yeasty
flavors
but
a
good
solid
onetwo
punch
of
malt
and
hops
quickly
follows
at
the
very
end
theres
a
faint
but
unmistakable
reprise
of
the
orange
peel
very
nice
perfect
dark
ruby
color
the
ideal
color
for
bw
intricate
nose
of
pancake
batter
and
butterscotch
icing
covered
fruit
cake
and
notes
of
caramel
raisins
and
fig
flavor
is
a
bit
raw
and
grainy
in
the
backround
mildly
unrefined
but
there
are
some
seriously
impressive
and
delicious
characteristics
to
this
barley
wine
its
actually
very
complex
hints
of
vanilla
graham
caramel
toffee
malt
induced
fruits
along
with
a
very
subtle
but
present
hop
character
of
pine
and
fruits
pure
natural
body
with
excellent
creamyheaviness
wow
what
a
beer
much
better
than
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
version
this
is
a
beer
worthy
of
collecting
im
pretty
sure
this
beer
isnt
retired
but
anyways
its
a
very
mellow
barleywine
more
english
in
inspiration
but
theres
a
american
kick
to
the
hops
the
grassy
spicy
hops
actually
are
almost
an
aftertaste
but
still
standout
from
the
hops
the
malt
are
slight
with
a
vanillaoak
taste
not
much
fruit
worth
a
try
very
nice
but
powerful
brew
that
is
perhaps
slightly
overcharged
on
the
alcohol
taste
but
still
very
worthwhile
pours
medium
to
dark
copper
with
a
good
sized
cream
head
that
slowly
recedes
big
malted
milk
sweetness
m
ixes
with
some
nice
raisin
and
prune
aromas
there
is
also
a
little
salt
and
leathery
aroma
alcohol
is
also
evident
in
the
aroma
taste
is
big
and
sweet
maltedness
pruniness
comes
thru
mid
taste
with
some
berry
flavor
mixing
with
the
sweet
malts
before
giving
into
an
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
very
rich
and
sugary
the
finish
balances
with
a
nice
dryness
a
maltbomb
for
sure
doppelbocklike
qualities
in
the
strength
of
the
maltiness
are
well
balanced
by
the
slight
dryness
and
alcohol
warmth
thanks
daniel
for
the
opportunity
a
very
hoppy
barleywine
or
is
it
a
dipa
ive
had
sweeter
dipas
a
debate
for
another
day
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
am
starting
to
wait
for
central
waters
to
open
in
md
d
im
surprised
this
beer
is
this
old
the
alcohol
dominates
the
malt
flavors
the
alcohol
is
not
really
fusel
but
it
is
pretty
bitey
pours
a
giant
head
i
didnt
ever
think
a
barleywine
would
give
such
a
giant
head
it
almost
overflowed
theres
a
good
strong
lacing
to
it
as
well
the
color
is
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
slightly
reddish
hue
the
smell
is
very
barleywinelike
if
you
understand
this
at
all
its
a
bit
sweet
it
has
a
hop
presence
and
some
dark
fruit
smells
the
taste
is
very
hoppy
and
has
a
dark
fruit
taste
it
is
a
full
bodied
barleywine
with
a
hoppy
dark
fruit
taste
its
pretty
good
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
nothing
bad
to
say
there
overall
i
think
i
would
enjoy
this
once
in
a
while
and
cellared
for
a
bit
too
4
5s
are
given
not
only
because
it
is
good
but
because
it
is
very
interesting
for
a
barleywine
id
like
to
try
this
one
again
after
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
2006
slightly
hazy
deep
auburn
headed
towards
chestnut
color
huge
rocky
head
of
light
tan
excellent
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
malty
very
sweetly
caramelish
toffeeish
do
i
detect
some
mild
buttery
diacetyl
under
there
nice
theres
a
touch
of
yeasty
mineralish
character
as
well
citrusy
hops
come
through
once
the
head
subsides
a
little
bit
in
the
mouth
its
full
bodied
with
an
initial
zestiness
on
the
tongue
once
warm
however
it
becomes
more
dextrinous
and
creamy
the
flavor
is
aggressive
lots
of
hops
and
bitterness
atop
the
sweet
caramel
malt
base
citrusy
and
piney
sweet
malt
combines
and
softens
the
citrus
theres
some
orange
grapefruit
and
pineapple
the
bitterness
is
dense
and
cuts
through
the
sweet
malt
with
a
pineyhop
chainsaw
before
it
even
gets
midpalate
rough
edges
but
cooling
and
refreshing
it
finishes
mainly
dry
and
piney
with
a
cooling
minty
edge
although
there
is
still
a
thin
strand
of
sticky
caramel
left
behind
a
caramelcoated
pinecone
in
conclusion
some
like
it
rough
and
if
thats
the
case
this
ones
a
rarin
ta
go
and
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
i
can
only
assume
that
thats
the
way
this
was
intended
to
be
soft
sweet
caramel
and
then
bam
pineyjuicy
punch
nice
but
for
those
who
like
it
a
bit
more
rounded
youll
need
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
on
this
one
i
enjoyed
it
sip
by
sip
with
my
feet
propped
in
front
of
the
fire
ah
err
space
heater
single
smuggled
back
from
mad
town
pours
a
nice
amber
red
color
with
a
fizzy
offwhite
colored
head
leaving
trace
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
caramel
dark
fruits
cherries
strawberries
and
hint
of
vanilla
taste
is
much
of
the
same
complex
and
sweet
but
not
cloying
a
hint
of
hops
is
detected
as
well
as
a
small
amount
of
alcohol
warmth
mouthfeel
would
be
perfect
its
full
bodied
and
smooth
but
there
is
just
way
too
much
carbonation
drinkability
suffers
from
the
carbonation
levels
as
well
otherwise
this
would
be
a
damn
near
perfect
beer
to
me
drinkability
bitter
and
hoppy
but
enjoyable
go
on
home
your
mamas
calling
you
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
in
madison
today
on
my
way
to
mn
is
this
really
leftover
from
2000
if
so
then
this
is
6
years
old
lets
see
about
that
pours
a
ruddy
amber
with
a
darker
center
finger
of
dense
clingy
offcream
head
soon
recedes
to
a
film
with
minor
lacing
rich
malts
of
toffee
and
butterscotch
mix
with
rum
and
bourbon
candied
fruits
and
herbal
hops
round
out
the
nose
scorched
caramel
and
toasted
bitterness
flavors
lead
off
herbal
bitterness
follows
rich
sweetish
malts
midpalate
come
in
and
make
this
beer
great
bread
pudding
butterscotch
candied
fruits
and
oak
herbal
bitterness
closes
the
door
but
the
finish
shows
glimmers
of
butterscotch
madeira
and
vanilla
mediumfull
body
with
a
tingly
yet
creamy
feel
if
this
is
from
2000
then
it
has
aged
very
well
smooth
and
incredibly
balanced
should
have
bought
more
i
guess
a
bighuge
thanks
to
cokes
for
landing
this
muskie
for
me
its
a
rather
bold
gutsy
brew
that
asserts
from
the
start
while
not
especially
unique
it
does
establish
some
measure
of
identity
the
balance
wavers
slightly
at
times
but
it
never
truly
tilts
the
alcohol
carries
a
serious
stature
and
that
abv
has
some
effect
in
keeping
consumption
limited
still
its
worth
trying
if
its
in
the
house
and
it
wont
likely
be
a
disappointment
open
this
on
a
special
occasion
or
save
it
for
your
bomb
shelter
for
future
terrorist
alerts
a
good
brew
overall
but
sip
it
lethargically
and
make
it
last
you
wont
find
this
around
too
much
and
its
a
very
good
barleywine
compared
to
other
central
waters
brews
this
is
near
the
top
of
my
list
cheers
to
cokes
for
the
brew
this
is
another
barley
wine
i
didnt
like
very
much
im
just
not
a
fan
of
the
style
pours
a
rose
amber
with
small
head
fruity
and
citrus
aroma
it
starts
out
thick
and
malty
but
has
a
big
hop
finish
i
thought
id
enjoy
barley
wine
if
i
found
one
with
enough
bitterness
but
i
still
dont
like
the
style
im
having
a
hard
time
picking
out
what
it
is
i
dont
like
about
this
beer
it
had
good
hops
the
alcohol
was
masked
fairly
well
and
it
should
have
been
aged
enough
by
now
something
about
the
wine
character
of
the
taste
doesnt
agree
with
me
overall
a
nice
barleywine
quite
good
but
nothing
extraordinary
in
the
catagory
give
it
a
shot
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
brewery
or
the
band
as
i
obviously
am
on
both
counts
o
exellent
ba
barleywine
in
my
top
five
for
sure
thanks
to
rl
for
sharing
this
one
it
was
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
totally
solid
barleywine
appreciated
most
the
caramel
and
vanilla
undertones
overall
very
good
strong
bourbon
barrel
i
will
have
it
again
2015
vintage
appearance
in
the
glass
is
a
very
unattractive
murky
brown
color
with
a
thin
khaki
head
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
beer
transforms
displaying
a
very
cloudy
yet
magnificent
ruby
red
body
caramel
and
toffee
dominate
the
nose
dark
fruits
booze
subtle
barrel
notes
taste
is
extremely
boozy
unbalanced
seems
like
a
beer
that
requires
at
least
a
half
year
to
develop
in
the
bottle
getting
the
same
toffee
and
dark
fruits
on
the
taste
with
minimal
bourbon
and
vanilla
there
is
an
earthymusty
bitter
hop
aftertaste
need
to
track
down
another
bottle
to
age
and
hopefully
appreciate
more
absolutely
fantastic
really
this
is
what
fans
of
ba
beers
are
looking
for
wish
i
would
have
had
this
around
a
month
ago
when
it
was
15
degrees
warming
been
sipping
this
for
an
hour
and
fifteen
minutes
now
recommendation
somewhat
overhyped
for
me
way
better
ba
barleywine
options
out
there
would
try
to
get
a
hold
of
their
bourbon
barrel
stout
or
cherry
stout
instead
those
are
fantastic
overall
i
was
a
little
wary
of
the
barrel
aging
uncertain
of
how
strong
the
bourbon
flavors
would
be
but
actually
it
came
out
as
a
traditional
nicely
balanced
and
complex
barleywine
the
alcohol
is
definitely
a
big
player
here
and
is
stronger
than
i
prefer
especially
considering
the
price
i
would
rather
get
a
pack
of
sn
bigfoot
but
this
is
a
nice
sipper
a
really
good
american
barleywine
this
thing
is
kind
of
a
monster
like
a
monster
thats
coated
itself
with
caramel
and
smacks
you
in
the
back
of
the
head
when
youre
not
looking
overall
truly
delicious
probably
the
best
barleywine
i
have
had
this
one
is
very
young
the
alcohol
really
stands
out
it
may
take
some
time
to
mellow
though
it
is
certainly
enjoyable
now
the
aroma
itself
is
simply
wonderful
drinking
a
2014
and
wow
is
it
drinking
good
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
o
this
is
a
very
very
good
ba
barleywine
the
bourbon
is
not
too
overpowering
but
blends
insanely
well
with
the
base
beer
bourbon
and
vanilla
become
more
prevalent
as
the
beer
warms
top
5
ba
bw
for
sure
easier
to
acquire
and
cheaper
than
sucaba
and
is
in
a
better
format
for
when
i
want
to
have
a
single
12
oz
instead
of
opening
a
750
ml
recommended
great
taste
light
and
refreshing
great
bsrley
wine
sweet
caramel
goodness
with
a
bourbon
kick
fantastic
o
overall
this
is
awesome
easily
on
par
with
firestones
abacus
easily
and
much
more
accessible
i
will
pick
up
more
before
its
gone
this
season
and
this
will
be
my
go
to
for
the
style
very
good
fresh
but
cant
wait
to
see
what
some
age
does
to
this
beer
to
be
continued
very
solid
beer
sweet
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
very
complex
has
all
the
delicious
flavors
one
would
except
from
a
fine
barley
wine
such
as
toffee
dates
and
vanilla
it
is
just
a
tad
on
the
boozy
side
i
think
a
year
on
it
would
go
a
long
way
overall
this
was
a
very
good
beer
and
id
definitely
recommend
it
to
fans
of
the
style
2015
release
bought
today
i
had
1st
had
this
last
year
and
was
waiting
for
this
years
release
pour
some
into
a
snifter
put
your
feet
up
in
your
favorite
chair
and
just
enjoy
it
does
not
get
better
than
this
in
my
experience
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
oh
so
good
on
a
winters
evening
good
barleywine
really
enjoy
what
the
barrel
adds
to
this
one
this
is
a
decimate
sipper
but
so
enjoyable
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
ever
had
worth
the
trade
though
boozy
and
hot
potential
is
here
but
this
is
like
barrel
aged
rubbing
alcohol
perhaps
its
too
young
going
against
the
grain
here
and
giving
this
one
a
very
mediocre
ok
best
bourbon
barrel
i
have
ever
experienced
floating
specks
of
flavor
are
a
nice
surprise
mine
said
brewers
reserve
on
it
but
i
didnt
see
that
listed
separately
on
the
site
heck
yeah
this
beer
tastes
like
they
took
the
malt
boil
poured
it
into
a
bourbon
barrel
added
some
green
hops
and
called
it
a
day
its
absolutely
delicious
overall
heh
this
brew
gets
me
excited
every
time
i
smell
it
this
is
one
of
the
best
barrel
aged
barleywines
no
lies
no
gimmicks
it
sucks
that
i
cant
get
this
brew
regularly
yet
it
keeps
me
hoping
for
the
next
release
of
bourbon
county
brand
barleywine
the
mouthfeel
holds
this
brew
back
from
dominating
bcbbw
this
is
now
one
of
my
favorite
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywines
this
is
recommended
serving
from
a
2014
bottle
into
a
snifter
nice
sweety
caramely
aroma
lots
of
grainy
bourbon
smell
dark
amber
in
color
poured
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
great
tasting
beer
very
sweet
lots
of
alcohol
burn
really
can
pull
the
bourbon
barrel
age
out
of
it
one
thing
to
note
im
drinking
mine
at
around
55
temp
my
gf
has
hers
refrigerated
both
are
great
the
colder
one
is
slightly
smoother
with
less
alcohol
burn
but
not
as
flavorful
another
great
solid
barrel
aged
beer
from
cw
overall
3
75
o
right
there
with
sucaba
overall
this
is
one
tasty
brew
like
i
said
not
as
heavy
as
i
expected
it
to
be
the
alcohol
doesnt
hit
as
hard
as
you
might
expect
from
an
11
5er
wonderfully
sweet
one
of
the
best
caramel
flavors
youll
ever
see
im
not
normally
a
huge
fan
of
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
but
this
one
is
a
musthave
o
just
a
fantastic
bbbw
huge
flavors
not
too
sweet
not
too
boozy
just
terrific
overall
i
would
put
this
up
against
any
belgian
quad
or
dark
strong
for
the
beauty
of
its
complexity
and
overall
taste
ive
read
that
it
gets
even
better
with
age
well
ive
got
three
more
bottles
and
i
may
pick
up
more
in
the
next
week
or
so
this
is
heading
for
the
cellar
this
is
really
awesome
its
barreled
perfectly
its
got
to
be
one
of
the
smoothest
barleywines
ive
ever
had
its
decadent
and
a
rare
treat
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
barleywine
that
affords
an
extravaganza
for
the
senses
from
the
seductive
aroma
to
the
bombastic
taste
there
are
no
false
steps
here
i
appreciate
how
central
waters
didnt
try
to
go
too
hop
forward
like
some
american
barleywines
instead
opting
to
let
the
malt
and
bourbon
take
center
stage
a
sipper
though
it
may
be
that
only
serves
to
prolong
the
enjoyment
the
only
other
barleywine
ive
tried
on
par
with
this
is
sucaba
so
that
comparison
should
pretty
much
speak
for
itself
overall
i
much
prefer
central
waters
bourbon
barrel
stout
to
the
barelywine
it
is
far
too
harsh
for
my
liking

thanks
man
pours
murky
brownish
amber
with
a
small
creamy
yellow
khaki
head
big
caramel
toffee
aroma
with
vanilla
raisins
dark
fruits
sweet
smooth
bourbon

very
slight

flavor
is
sweet
caramel
bourbon
oak
dark
sweet
fruit
and
a
huuuge
vanilla
marshmallow
finish
that
lingers
a
good
while
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
chewy
body
with
some
nice
booze
bite
overall
a
very
nice
sweet
barleywine
dark
fruits
and
sugar
dominate
the
flavor
making
this
a
nice
dessert
beer
overall
the
bourbon
is
really
up
front
on
this
one
but
the
2014
vintage
crushed
the
2013
vintage
that
i
had
about
3
months
ago
maybe
this
beer
is
truly
better
fresh
an
excellent
bbbw
2013
bottle
amber
cloudy
appearance
which
merits
a
careful
pour
excellent
oaky
vanilla
nose
slightly
pungent
one
of
the
best
noses
on
a
beer
sweet
and
subtly
sour
taste
which
i
think
stems
from
a
noticeable
yeast
component
no
hop
presence
oaky
sweet
finish
gets
sweeter
and
oakier
as
it
warms
to
room
temp
this
beer
never
disappoints
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
is
a
great
example
of
what
a
barrel
aged
barleywine
ale
should
be
o
got
this
in
a
trade
from
ba
user
kevsal
and
i
am
super
greatful
i
will
be
looking
for
this
again
all
bourbon
barrel
barleywines
pretty
much
win
my
heart
has
a
phenomenal
smell
and
a
pretty
awesome
taste
to
go
with
it
overall
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
but
that
leaves
it
a
little
more
drinkable
for
a
big
beer
a
very
solid
example
of
the
style
i
wish
more
beers
like
this
were
available
to
me
locally
also
for
a
2012
beer
this
has
a
surprising
amount
of
hop
bite
a
pretty
delicious
and
deliciously
drinkable
powerhouse
of
a
beer
beautiful
looking
a
cloudy
orangeish
brown
it
looks
like
your
dream
of
a
barrelaged
barley
wine
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thinner
than
many
barleywines
but
wonderfully
creamy
taste
is
surprisingly
smooth
the
aging
seems
to
iron
out
the
coarseness
i
find
in
many
barleywines
vanilla
is
the
most
prominent
flavor
theres
really
just
a
hint
of
bourbon
which
is
a
big
plus
in
my
mind
and
the
alcohol
taste
is
slight
as
well
it
comes
across
like
a
lighter
fw
sucaba
or
bcbbw
to
meand
not
as
good
as
an
overall
brew
but
very
nice
if
you
want
something
similar
and
lighter
maybe
not
the
best
descriptive
word
o
well
recommended
on
draft
at
the
local
option
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
substantial
head
the
nose
is
sweet
vanilla
and
rich
caramel
toffee
at
this
point
im
ready
to
take
a
bath
in
this
stuff
taste
delivers
what
the
nose
promised
lots
of
sweet
vanilla
bourbon
up
front
then
transitions
into
caramel
maltiness
and
finishes
with
a
strong
tart
hoppiness
very
tart
and
hoppy
on
the
end
mouthfeel
was
a
delight
chewy
creamy
and
somewhere
between
medium
and
highcarbed
a
fantastic
ba
barleywine
it
has
all
the
best
aspects
of
a
englishstyle
ba
barleywine
up
front
and
the
intense
hoppy
tartness
you
see
in
american
barleywines
provides
a
great
contrast
at
the
end
so
good
i
had
to
order
another
this
promises
to
be
one
of
the
elite
with
the
appearance
and
aroma
but
falls
short
in
the
flavor
category
the
oak
and
bourbon
heat
dominate
the
palate
some
dark
fruit
and
sugars
present
themselves
mid
palate
but
then
fade
to
just
sugar
oak
and
bourbon
still
a
very
good
barleywine
just
not
in
the
same
league
as
sucaba
moas
etc
o
another
good
bourbon
barrel
beer
from
central
waters
a
little
age
might
mellow
this
out
beers
like
this
are
difficult
for
me
to
rate
its
clearly
a
wellcrafted
product
with
an
abundance
of
intense
flavors
and
marvelous
aromas
unfortunately
even
though
i
enjoy
american
barleywines
im
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
aging
these
in
bourbon
barrels
i
find
that
the
bitter
hop
flavors
clash
a
bit
on
my
palate
with
the
sweet
boozy
notes
and
the
malt
is
not
allowed
to
work
its
magic
now
english
barleywines
good
gracious
those
are
custommade
for
bourbonbarrelaging
nevertheless
i
continue
to
try
these
as
i
come
across
them
or
as
wonderful
traders
like
ri0
bless
me
with
their
generosity
in
hopes
that
my
palate
will
eventually
accept
them
very
nice
beer
from
central
waters
which
is
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
them
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
really
didnt
pick
up
a
whole
lot
of
bourbon
etiher
on
the
nose
or
the
palate
otherwise
this
is
a
very
fine
beer
from
cw
central
waterss
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
ale
is
an
interesting
and
complex
beer
that
makes
for
a
perfect
sipper
on
a
cold
winter
night
i
aged
my
bottle
for
a
year
but
i
feel
that
even
more
time
might
help
mellow
out
some
of
the
booziness
and
the
bitterness
on
the
finish
so
there
does
exist
a
barley
wine
that
lives
up
to
its
hype
and
it
is
this
central
waters
offering
hazy
and
rich
caramel
colored
beer
with
an
awesome
white
head
over
an
inch
tall
and
lasting
all
the
whole
time
it
smells
like
caramelized
grain
sugar
raw
sugar
toffee
dessert
and
booze
but
only
just
enough
the
nose
and
taste
both
suggest
ridiculous
barrel
influence
i
mean
tons
of
vanilla
tons
of
char
tons
of
everything
sugars
too
but
its
not
too
sweet
i
get
good
bourbon
all
the
way
through
with
that
oaky
earthen
character
and
all
the
vanilla
in
the
world
while
the
booze
remains
way
back
but
persistent
enough
for
me
to
want
to
let
this
warm
and
drink
it
slowly
although
neither
the
body
nor
the
sugar
makes
this
hard
to
drink
smooth
down
long
vanilla
finish
like
creme
brûlée
in
many
ways
to
rich
for
a
ton
of
it
but
highly
appreciated
in
reasonable
doses
a
good
twelve
ounce
to
share
and
finally
a
central
waters
beer
worthy
of
its
high
praise
this
is
wonderful
barleywine
as
good
as
american
made
english
style
gets
lots
of
bourbon
flavor
especially
vanilla
but
the
hops
cut
into
the
sweetness
making
it
extremely
drinkable
not
as
dry
or
hoppy
as
some
other
american
barleywines
so
it
can
taste
a
little
sweet
but
this
is
great
almost
no
head
whatsoever
hopefully
i
can
manage
to
age
a
few
of
these
overall
very
tasty
boozy
barleywine
the
wood
and
vanilla
flavors
are
offset
somewhat
by
the
hops
so
its
not
just
a
bourbon
fest
nice
changeup
from
the
bourbon
stouts
ive
had
during
this
long
winter
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
am
going
to
lay
several
down
as
i
think
9
months
to
a
year
will
do
wonders
i
am
have
been
disappointed
by
most
of
central
waters
beers
but
this
one
is
by
far
the
best
i
have
had
from
them
and
with
a
touch
of
cellaring
this
has
potential
to
be
awesome
o
this
beer
was
great
fresh
and
is
still
great
after
one
yr
in
cellar
i
have
2
more
bottles
of
the
13
that
i
will
open
after
2
and
3
yrs
and
see
how
they
progress
i
am
thinking
this
beer
is
only
going
to
get
smoother
and
smoother
with
time
delicious
offering
as
always
from
a
great
wisconsin
brewery
nicely
done
central
waters
o
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
i
did
enjoy
it
however
it
was
too
similar
to
a
standard
barleywine
if
this
was
a
standard
barleywine
the
smell
and
taste
scores
would
be
higher
however
reviewing
it
for
what
it
is
this
beer
leaves
me
wanting
more
influence
from
the
barrel
perhaps
age
helps
this
beer
if
i
get
my
hands
on
more
ill
lay
a
couple
down
for
a
year
a
good
beer
but
not
amazing
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
small
off
white
head
smell
has
tons
of
bourbon
with
vanilla
toffee
carmel
and
sweet
malts
taste
is
like
the
nose
lots
of
bourbon
with
the
other
flavors
in
the
background
a
little
boozy
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
with
lower
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
barleywine
that
if
i
had
access
to
would
buy
a
lot
overall
i
look
forward
to
this
release
every
year
a
wonderful
boozy
but
balanced
sweet
take
on
a
barrelaged
barleywine
have
another
4
pack
in
the
cellar
and
looking
forward
to
seeing
what
its
like
at
6
months
and
on
o
i
had
this
to
do
a
comparison
with
insanity
this
was
less
harsh
and
more
mellow
and
sweet
compared
to
insanity
i
would
have
thought
insanity
would
have
been
less
bitter
since
it
is
an
english
style
but
the
bourbon
was
too
prevalent
in
it
going
to
age
both
and
see
how
they
are
i
do
recommend
this
one
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
bb
barley
wine
and
hopefully
the
booze
mellows
out
with
some
age
on
the
bottle
it
has
a
lot
of
potential
superb
drinking
ba
barleywine
despite
the
abv
it
doesnt
seem
overly
hot
to
me
although
you
do
feel
it
as
you
chug
it
down
sip
dont
chug
to
say
this
is
well
balanced
is
correct
all
elements
come
together
nicely
preventing
it
from
being
too
hoppy
too
boozy
too
sweet
or
too
anything
else
just
a
solid
and
delightful
beer
thats
more
drinkable
that
youd
expect
very
nice
thank
you
pmarlowe
for
this
outstanding
extra
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
thin
tan
head
good
retention
and
lacing
heavy
bourbon
on
the
nose
along
with
dark
fruit
and
biscuity
malt
aromas
sweet
bourbon
throughout
the
palate
offset
by
faint
hop
bitterness
heavy
mouthfeel
with
lots
of
alcohol
heat
and
little
carbonation
overall
this
great
ba
barleywine
is
one
that
could
lay
down
for
a
few
years
amber
orange
and
cloudy
with
light
tan
head
smells
is
super
sweet
bourbon
with
alcohol
coming
through
taste
is
fantastic
sweet
brown
sugar
big
bourbon
with
slight
tang
heat
lingering
well
after
swallowed
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
a
little
silky
not
as
silky
as
their
y2k
but
very
nice
overall
this
is
another
central
waters
to
seek
out
if
you
like
this
beer
style
you
will
not
be
disappointed
picked
up
a
case
and
will
be
aging
some
of
this
one
overall
woodmans
only
had
2
cases
of
this
dropped
off
on
thursday
i
bought
two
4
packs
and
think
i
may
need
to
go
find
more
to
age
i
recently
had
a
couple
samplers
of
the
bc
barleywine
and
this
definitely
is
right
there
with
it
in
terms
of
overall
quality
and
complexity
very
impressed
maybe
im
crazy
but
feel
like
this
has
lost
a
little
of
the
rich
caramel
flavor
i
remembered
still
a
great
beer
and
cant
wait
for
the
2014
release
another
awesome
central
waters
beer
so
nice
and
smooth
this
is
one
of
the
better
barleywines
i
have
enjoyed
lately
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
small
head
big
notes
of
bourbon
and
mash
i
soo
wish
that
cw
was
distributed
in
my
area
overall
awesome
o
a
big
malty
barley
wine
with
an
organically
natural
tasting
barrel
flavor
thats
great
for
sipping
on
a
cold
winter
night
cheers
cw
keep
up
the
good
work
bottom
line
if
you
like
strong
beers
that
overwhelm
you
with
oaky
bourbon
flavors
buy
more
than
one
of
this
guy
o
one
of
the
better
barleywines
out
there
i
bet
aging
makes
this
one
unbeatable
share
with
friends
verdict
a
delightful
barrel
aged
barleywine
from
central
waters
and
one
of
their
finest
products
the
body
really
doesnt
do
this
beer
justice
as
the
flavors
are
so
spot
on
perfect
marshmallow
toastiness
it
reminds
me
a
lot
bb4d
which
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
date
overall
a
great
bwine
that
probably
could
have
stayed
in
the
cellar
for
another
year
or
two
and
possibly
benefited
fairly
hoppy
and
still
tastes
a
little
young
in
my
expert
opinion
anyways
overall
i
dont
think
this
is
an
american
barleywine
its
more
akin
to
a
british
barleywine
a
nice
barleywine
not
too
unlike
weyerbachers
insanity
though
thinner
not
unlike
lost
abbeys
angel
share
but
half
the
price
i
picked
this
up
in
pennsylvania
last
week
but
only
got
one
illl
buy
more
if
i
get
back
down
there
sometime
soon
overall
i
like
this
beer
although
it
is
hardhitting
in
the
strength
department
id
say
though
that
it
needs
more
than
just
one
or
two
years
to
mellow
this
is
a
really
outstanding
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
every
year
cw
makes
many
outstanding
bba
beers
and
this
one
is
my
favorite
run
to
get
this
one
central
waters
can
do
no
wrong
with
their
special
releases
this
is
a
gem
from
a
lineup
full
of
gems
next
time
im
up
north
a
few
more
of
these
bottles
will
be
picked
up
without
a
doubt
i
cant
recommend
this
enough
if
youre
a
fan
of
english
barleywines
thanks
again
for
the
bottle
dave
o
an
excellent
barrel
aged
beer
cw
just
knows
what
to
do
with
beer
in
a
barrel
something
i
would
love
to
drink
again
overall
this
was
very
enjoyable
definitely
recommend
it
if
you
enjoy
bourbon
because
it
really
shines
through
overall
excellent
example
of
a
ba
barelywine
a
rich
tapestry
of
flavor
overall
this
was
my
first
ba
barleywine
and
im
hooked
i
will
for
sure
be
on
the
hunt
for
more
of
this
great
brew
just
an
outstanding
beer
sampled
from
a
12ox
bottle
thanks
surge1311
this
is
a
big
boozy
beer
in
fact
it
might
be
a
bourbon
with
a
hit
of
beer
the
aroma
is
strong
bourbon
the
flavor
follows
with
a
rich
malt
backbone
this
beer
is
flavorful
and
intense
i
think
the
bourbon
dominates
too
much
but
its
a
fantastic
beer
that
leaves
you
with
a
lot
to
think
about
thought
it
was
very
good
wouldnt
mind
having
more
to
open
every
few
months
to
note
any
mellowingchanges
o
very
good
enjoyed
very
much
yes
very
sweet
and
a
bit
boozy
at
times
but
it
is
11
5
abv
flavors
are
excellent
bourbonvanillaoakiness
are
very
drinkable
nose
bursts
with
awesomeness
o
another
great
ba
beer
from
central
waters
have
enjoyed
pretty
much
everything
i
have
tried
from
them
solid
barleywine
would
drink
this
again
m
warm
roasted
full
overall
if
you
cant
get
enough
bourbon
in
your
beer
this
is
for
you
if
you
like
a
more
balanced
barrel
flavor
there
are
better
choices
pour
is
more
of
a
dark
auburn
with
a
fairly
tall
head
smelled
the
bourbon
right
when
i
cracked
it
open
great
aroma
bourbon
with
earthy
hop
notes
along
with
chocolate
the
bourbon
is
upfront
in
this
so
if
thats
not
your
style
you
may
not
like
it
almost
a
sweet
taste
to
the
bourbon
maybe
a
caramel
great
brew
all
around
o
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
if
you
do
not
like
bourbon
you
will
not
like
this
one
i
for
one
found
it
to
be
delicious
and
would
pick
it
up
again
if
i
had

bourbonforward
barleywine
sometimes
i
find
this
one
to
be
a
bit
too
hoppy
but
time
always
does
this
beer
well
oa
barleywine
for
the
bourbon
drinker
too
bourbon
forward
for
me
this
one
is
too
much
like
a
shot
of
bourbon
in
every
sip
to
be
enjoyable
big
time
sipper
overall
and
excellent
beer
and
definitely
a
sipper
i
enjoy
the
dominance
of
the
bourbon
and
roast
as
opposed
to
the
cloying
sweetness
sometimes
found
in
a
bareywine
well
done
cw
overall
bravisimo
to
the
conductor
of
this
symphony
i
stood
up
and
applauded
furiously
to
express
my
gratitude
and
appreciation
of
the
music
that
was
presented
to
my
tastebuds
o
great
carmel
and
vanilla
with
a
hint
of
bourbon
stellar
overall
a
really
great
malt
forward
barley
wine
the
barrel
aging
adds
some
great
notes
sweet
but
far
from
cloying
oexcellent
top
notch
beer
that
does
well
in
a
style
thats
crowded
with
competition
recommended
but
not
overwhelming
thanks
for
this
one
mr
parker
o
its
a
nice
brew
and
this
would
be
a
great
introductory
barleywine
to
people
who
arent
familiar
with
the
style
and
it
has
high
drinkability
high
b
overall
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
had
in
a
while
as
a
bourbon
fan
i
really
enjoy
the
barrel
accents
in
this
brew
it
stands
out
but
is
in
no
way
offensive
by
far
the
best
central
waters
product
i
have
had
they
will
get
some
more
opportunities
after
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
one
the
appearance
is
dark
redbrown
with
a
thin
tannish
head
its
nose
comes
off
with
malts
a
good
deal
of
bourbon
vanilla
brown
sugar
and
raisins
tipping
this
one
back
and
it
tastes
of
caramel
syrup
more
malts
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
full
bodied
finishes
with
oak
and
bourbon
a
nice
barleywine
from
this
brewery
out
of
wisconsin
had
to
pick
this
one
up
while
passing
through
pa
this
poured
out
as
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
there
was
a
decent
retention
as
well
as
some
lacing
for
a
while
there
was
some
oily
legs
on
the
glass
as
well
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
boozy
lots
of
ethanol
on
the
nose
hints
of
vanilla
and
caramel
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
sweet
malty
with
more
vanilla
and
some
subtle
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
smooth
oily
moderate
carbonation
and
kind
of
thick
overall
this
beer
is
really
quite
good
big
amounts
of
flavors
has
a
lot
of
the
characteristics
of
a
solid
barley
wine
worth
trying
for
sure
o
i
think
this
will
really
round
out
in
about
a
year
the
hop
bitterness
is
not
bad
but
the
front
it
so
mellow
that
the
moderate
hop
bit
at
the
end
seems
more
pronounced
i
think
with
some
time
this
will
move
from
an
a
to
an
aa
o
the
best
12
oz
ba
bw
i
have
had
to
date
not
as
refined
or
complex
as
the
rarer
examples
but
this
is
a
totally
unforgiving
bourbon
bomb
of
a
barleywine
and
i
like
that
a
lot
o
this
is
a
perfect
candidate
for
the
cellar
but
i
dont
think
id
get
another
one
fresh
even
on
tap
it
hits
hard
and
bitter
the
beer
pours
clear
amber
red
with
about
an
inch
of
cappuccinocolored
head
head
died
quick
with
only
a
little
lacing
sweet
smoky
fruity
and
exciting
i
can
clearly
smell
honey
vanilla
and
oak
a
full
rich
nose
flavor
is
pretty
boozy
at
this
point
not
a
ton
of
heat
but
there
is
a
huge
bourbon
flavor
the
flavor
also
matches
the
smell
but
i
love
that
the
barleywine
is
not
too
sweet
very
good
profile
which
will
be
amazing
with
some
age
creamy
mediumbodied
and
leaves
syrup
on
the
tongue
already
and
very
good
beer
i
cant
wait
for
the
booze
and
heat
to
mellow
out
it
will
be
fantastic
o
a
fantastic
barleywine
that
is
complemented
very
nicely
by
bourbon
barrel
aging
best
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywine
ive
tried
to
date
although
i
do
have
sucaba
and
barrelaged
bigfoot
waiting
in
my
cellar
i
inherently
hate
central
waters
for
their
terrible
customer
service
but
they
make
a
damn
good
bbbw
d
this
would
definitely
be
a
prime
candidate
for
cellaring
as
soon
as
i
took
my
first
sip
i
thought
maybe
i
opened
this
too
soon
oh
well
live
and
learn
regardless
there
are
some
really
good
aromasflavors
going
on
here
that
im
sure
would
develop
some
nice
complexities
over
time
grab
a
few
if
you
can
o
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
ba
barleywines
ive
had
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
some
more
o
lay
her
down
and
i
think
this
will
be
great
in
a
few
years
she
is
surely
hot

say
the
least
and

that
recedes

the

the

a

than
other
reviews
would
have
led
me
to
believe
im
sure
this
ages
well
but
this
is
pretty
hot
fresh
still
very
very
good
and
worth
the
acclaim
overall
amazing
beer
and
a
permawant
overall
this
is
great
very
smooth
and
flavorful
nice
extra
from
a
recent
trade
o
great
barleywine
perfect
for
sipping
a
bit
boozy
but
i
like
that
o
this
beer
seems
a
little
young
and
could
use
a
bit
of
time
to
really
tame
down
and
let
some
maltiness
come
through
better
the
booziness
is
getting
a
little
too
much
for
me
all
in
all
the
beer
has
complexity
and
i
would
love
to
age
one
of
these
bottles
to
see
what
it
can
morph
into
o
really
liked
this
one
nicely
warming
without
impeding
the
drinkability
great
for
a
snowy
winter
day
this
really
hits
the
spot
complex
melding
of
flavors
was
thinking
of
sitting
on
a
couple
but
really
drinking
well
right
now
notes
much
more
of
an
english
ba
barleywine
in
my
view
nice
for
a
sweet
sipping
beer
that
definitely
presents
bourbon
flavors
but
isnt
too
harsh
nor
does
it
necessarily
rely
on
the
bourbon
although
im
not
sure
if
itd
be
anything
special
as
a
regular
barleywine
its
a
nice
treat
but
it
isnt
anything
earthshattering
for
the
style
o
slightly
boozy
for
11
2
abv
very
very
nice
the
caramel
and
vanilla
flavor
is
amazing
o
this
is
a
wickedly
good
beer
because
its
essentially
like
drinking
bourbon
if
you
like
bourbon
youll
enjoy
this
one
and
because
the
abv
is
so
high
i
can
only
enjoy
one
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
brewa
pure
sipper
im
sitting
here
watching
the
oscars
and
its
perfectit
makes
me
want
to
start
a
fire
in
the
fireplacethe
straight
barley
wine
flavor
playing
the
support
role
here
would
outshine
most
other
brews
by
itself
but
the
addition
of
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
gives
it
a
sophistication
deserving
of
a
snifter
glassboozy
straight
forward
intoxicating
this
brew
is
deserving
of
its
allusivenessi
was
lucky
to
snatch
it
up
when
i
did
and
thankful
i
have
a
couple
more
to
share
its
no
surprise
this
is
one
of
central

highest
rated
beersa
top
shelf
brew
thats
well
worth
the
price
if
you
get
the
chance
to
taste
this
take
itid
love
to
see
this
on
tap
somewhere
just
to
see
what
a
little
more
carbonation

would
do

a
fine
barleywine
probably
the
best
thing
ive
had
from
central
waters
o
a
wonderfully
beer
i
will
be
ageing
my
other
bottle
for
a
bit
to
see
how
the
beer
settles
into
itself
if
you
can
get
some
please
do
this
is
my
first
barrel
aged
barleywine
so
maybe
i
am
just
a
bit
overzealous
but
this
is
wonderful
thin
flavors
but
they
are
good
vanilla
caramel
wood
bourbon
and
earthy
pine
sweet
baked
caramel
is
ever
present
the
bourbon
barrel
provides
smoothness
yet
it
doesnt
mesh
well
with
the
other
flavors
the
hops
have
faded
to
be
sure
o
fantastic
beer
right
now
super
excited
to
let
a
few
age
definitely
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
ever
had
o
fantastic
barleywine
and
ba
beer
wish
i
had
a
few
more
to
cellar
this
is
a
great
barleywine
drinking
kind
of
hot
right
now
but
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
im
anxious
to
see
how
it
mellows
out
overall
a
very
well
done
bba
barleywine
the
bourbon
presence
is
balanced
nicely
with
the
caramel
malt
dark
fruit
and
bittering
hops
while
it
certainly
isnt
anything
earthshattering
as
far
as
bba
barleywines
go
this
really
is
a
phenomenal
beer
given
the
price
i
would
say
this
is
much
more
refined
and
delicious
after
having
the
goose
island
bbw
this
aint
too
bad
alcohol
has
toned
down
considerably
and
the
cloying
is
abated
smoother
and
palatable
review
scores
considerably
higher
with
age
not
quite
gi
english
bbw
worthy
but
you
know
us
american
barleywines
gotta
have
da
high
alcohol
presence
damn
fine
nonetheless
finally
got
to
try
this
beer
after
the
past
two
that
were
sent
to
me
as
extras
broke
during
shipping
third
times
a
charm
2013
vintage
pours
a
ruby
amber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
much
more
citrusy
and
hoppy
than
i
expected
at
first
i
get
citrus
hops
and
bitter
aromas
followed
by
sweet
bourbon
booziness
kinda
reminds
me
of
the
ba
bigfoot
i
had
a
few
weeks
ago
dark
fruit
aromas
and
a
bit
more
bourbon
taste
is
hoppy
as
well
very
interesting
after
reading
reviews
of
this
beer
i
was
not
expecting
this
maybe
i
drank
this
one
too
soon
or
the
2013
version
is
more
hoppy
citric
hoppy
bitterness
up
front
immediately
followed
by
delicious
barrel
flavors
lovely
bourbon
with
vanilla
coconut
and
toffee
not
very
boozy
for
what
the
abv
is
very
smooth
the
combo
of
the
hoppy
bitterness
the
citrus
the
bourbon
and
the
oak
make
this
one
quite
enjoyable
drinkability
very
high
mouthfeel
is
perfectly
carbonated
smooth
and
fullbodied
overall
i
dont
know
what
it
is
about
this
beer
but
the
only
other
hopforward
ba
barleywine
i
have
had
was
ba
bigfoot
i
cant
imagine
the
base
beer
for
this
one
being
as
hoppy
as
regular
bigfoot
im
so
confused
right
now
this
beer
threw
me
in
a
direction
i
was
not
expecting
but
it
was
very
delicious
i
guess
im
somewhat
disappointed
because
i
was
hoping
for
a
ba
barleywine
that
wasnt
familiar
cant
rate
it
on
that
though
o
a
fantastic
barleywine
a
fantastic
beer
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
extremely
well
balanced
great
fresh
but
cant
wait
to
put
a
few
years
of
age
on
the
bottle
o
a
very
interesting
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
very
strong
and
sharp
flavors
quite
hoppy
enough
to
not
get
drowned
out
by
all
the
malt
and
bourbon
which
are
pretty
substantial
pretty
hot
right
now
further
intensifying
the
flavors
a
sipper
for
sure
but
definitely
an
enjoyable
one
o
a
real
treat
central
waters
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
is
one
of
those
vintage
releases
each
year
that
must
not
go
unenjoyed
its
rich
presence
carries
from
aroma
to
flavor
though
the
smooth
feel
rounds
out
the
alcohol
nicely
for
a
bourbon
barrel
beer
thats
quite
drinkable
fresh
this
one
will
still
age
with
the
best
of
em
o
solid
ba
barleywine
for
the
price
with
a
lot
of
barrel
presence
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
and
with
all
of
the
bourbon
one
to
have
on
a
cold
night
its
main
downfall
is
that
the
bourbon
really
shines
and
make
the
beer
a
bit
too
hot
instead
of
blending
in
well
with
the
base
beer
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
i
can
tell
this
is
a
fairly
young
offering
despite
the
label
indication
being
a
bit
of
a
misfire
the
alcohols
is
out
in
the
open
with
flavor
and
solventnumbing
character
inside
the
mouth
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
lay
down
for
awhile
while
i
enjoyed
it
now
i
bet
it
would
get
nothing
but
better
with
some
age
mmmm
this
is
what
i
am
talkin
bout
the
bourbon
soaked
wood
oxidized
sherry
flavors
and
sweet
malt
come
together
damn
near
perfectly
the
mouthfeel
is
bigger
than
the
11
5
would
indicate
and
is
awesomely
rich
abv
is
so
well
integrated
at
this
point
it
is
very
smooth
this
is
awesome
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
quite
some
time
o
i
thought
3
5
years
might
have
done
this
a
disservice
but
its
still
going
quite
strong
if
i
lived
in
wi
i
would
stock
up
on
this
and
age
it
to
this
range
this
is
far
better
than
fresh
mother
of
all
storms
i
will
say
though
that
despite
my
gushing
about
it
i
had
arctic
devil
after
this
and
had
to
drop
this
one
a
few
points
because
ad
is
just
that
much
better
and
rounder
still
a
recommended

but
it
was
a
decent
offering
overall
o
really
happy
to
have
had
this
at
long
last
a
lovely
complex
sipper
that
being
said
very
glad
to
have
another
bottle
that
i
can
sit
on
for
a
year
to
see
if
the

lessens

of

that
left
beautiful
lacing
in

it
fell

caused
the
back
of
my
head
to
blow
off
coconutvanilla
bourbon
melded
with
sweet
malt
to
create
a
hot
boozy
melange
that
seared
my
nostrils
filled
my
sinus
cavity
and
when
i
stupidly
struck
a
match
to
see
what
was
going
on
ignited
blowing
out
my
brain
housing
group
wheeee
mouthfeel
seemed
to
suffer
from
cwbc
disease
i
e
thinness
but
the
heat
of
this
darling
erased
all
downfalls
i
had
a
cometojesus
moment
as
it
initially
had
the
heat
of
strained
and
lit
sterno
on
my
tongue
i
was
initially
overwhelmed
but
upon
recovering
i
got
tastes
of
coconutvanilla
with
a
big
caramel
malt
sweetness
where
did
i
score
this
oh
for
another
bottle
or
two
to
cellar
o
a
good
beer
with
plenty
of
potential
but
the
heat
is
still
up
there
imo
i
would
like
another
bottle
but
i
would
like
it
to
sit
for
a
year
or
two
i
gave
a
bottle
of
this
to
my
dad
and
he
said
it
made
him
stop
liking
craft
beer
i
guess
my
dads
getting
weirder
now
that
he
barely
drinks
anymore
due
to
heavy
doses
of
heart
medication
but
he
had
a
point
he
was
expecting
a
barleywine
mostly
and
he
barely
tasted
it
all
he
got
was
bourbon
and
thats
mainly
up
front
in
this
one
but
the
malt
bill
is
still
there
and
lets
face
it
barleywine
is
about
malt
the
thing
i
dont
get
is
he
used
to
be
a
big
scotch
and
bourbon
drinker
when
i
was
a
kid
he
just
said
he
was
grossed
out
because
there
was
bourbon
mixed
in
his
beer
but
he
didnt
complain
when
i
gave
him
my
homebrew
blackout
stout
made
with
applewood
and
oak
bourbon
chips
i
guess
the
moral
of
the
story
is
dont
drink
this
if
you
just
got
out
of
the
hospital
and
are
expecting
a
nonbourbon
flavored
beer
overall
excellent
beer
if
not
the
best
ba
barleywine
out
there
a
consistent
standby
that
i
almost
always
have
in
my
fridge
o
this
is
quite
good
right
now
but
will
no
doubt
get
even
better
with
age
the
flavors
are
all
there
and
great
and
the
alcohol
though
noticeable
doesnt
need
much
calming
bourbon
barrelaged
barleywine
is
one
of
my
very
favorite
styles
and
this
one
is
good
enough
to
stash
many
away
for
future
cold
and
rainy
days
a
very
welldone
brew
one
word
outstanding
this
beer
is
wholly
enjoyable
and
actually
showed
me
another
side
of
bourbon
barrel
aging
that
i
hadnt
experienced
previously
i
love
it
do
i
love
it
as
much
as
i
love
say
king
henry
or
mother
of
all
storms
well
im
hard
pressed
to
give
an
answer
on
that
i
might
have
to
have
the
three
side
by
side
to
determine
a
favorite
in
any
case
very
well
done
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywine
also
i
suppose
you
could
call
this
one
hot
or
boozy
at
this
stage
personally
i
enjoyed
it
like
that
but
im
thinking
it
should
start
to
mellow
after
little
while
say
812months
might
even
hit
a
sweet
spot
cant
wait
to
try
them
down
the
road
a
bit
overall
i
do
think
there
is
a
very
good
beer
in
here
but
it
is
so
masked
by
the
alcohol
that
im
having
a
hard
time
tasting
what
lies
underneath
ill
get
through
it
alright
without
a
struggle
but
i
would
lay
this
down
for
a
bit
before
attempting
it
again
overall
very
nice
delicious
great
bourbon
that
brings
lots
of
flavor
without
overpowering
delicious
vanilla
sweeteners
fruits
malts
and
even
a
long
spicy
earthy
hop
that
brings
nice
bitterness
and
has
held
up
for
almost
2
years
i
wish
i
could
get
a
lot
of
this
beer
i
wouldnt
call
it
my
fav
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywine
but
its
up
there
again
right
in
with
my
top
3
styles
overall
a
very
nice
barrel
aged
barleywine
but
not
in
the
same
league
as
kh
sucaba
and
leon
overall
with
all
the
flavors
here
it
would
have
been
easy
to
allow
one
to
take
over
and
tip
the
balance
but
at
no
point
does
this
delicious
masterpiece
go
too
far
in
any
direction
beer
advocate
encourages
reviewers
only
to
use
5s
when
a
beer
is
truly
exceptional
and
this
is
one
of
those
cases
this
one
pours
a
medium
bodied
cherry
wood
brown
with
a
one
finger
beige
head
the
nose
is
pretty
balanced
there
is
oak
vanilla
caramel
molasses
and
even
some
red
grape
character
the
flavors
too
are
complex
and
it
drinks
an
off
dry
the
flavors
are
sweet
and
malty
featuring
dark
red
fruit
a
good
amount
of
oak
vanilla
toffee
and
a
moderate
amount
of
alcohol
pretty
solid
and
more
balanced
than
i
expected
it
drinks
big
and
sticky
with
a
good
amount
of
wood
and
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
overall
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
its
better
than
the
majority
of
barrel
aged
barley
wines
out
there
overall
very
enjoyable
brew
this
one
could
be
allworld
w
a
few
years
of
age
in
the
cellar
as
it
was
a
bit
hot
for
my
liking
cheers
moreys
bottom
line
a
big
bad
barleywine
to
be
sure
if
you
dont
like
big
beers
this
isnt
for
you
plenty
of
bourbon
and
warming
alcohol
following
each
sip
a
bit
more
on
the
earthy
side
than
most
englishstyle
barleywines
its
somewhere
in
between
american
and
english
o
amazing
beer
i
was
concerned
that
i
hadnt
aged
it
long
enough
when
i
gave
in
to
opening
it
tonight
but
its
certainly
already
an
amazing
beer
to
drink
have
a
glass
of
this
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
be
in
its
distribution
range
you
wont
go
wrong
this
rivals
hoppin
frogs
naked
evil
for
my
favorite
barleywine
to
date
and
very
well
may
have
just
overtaken
it
o
great
beer
from
central
waters
theyre
doing
wonderful
things
with
their
barrel
program
drink
its
a
very
tasty
and
solid
12oz
love
the
fact
its
single
serving
the
booze
is
very
well
layered
and
doesnt
over
power
glad
i
have
a
12
to
hold
onto
until
next
year
o
a
very
enjoyable
barleywine
im
glad
i
finally
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
this
is
a
tasty
beer
in
all
aspects
big
bold
flavors
and
with
a
fuller
body
and
better
carbonation
this
beer
would
really
shine
overall
i
really
loved
this
beer
a
great
example
of
a
barleywine
and
on
top
of
it
they
barrel
aged
this
one
to
perfection
thanks
to
timmyj21
for
this
highly
recommended
you
pick
this
up
in
a
trade
or
off
the
shelf
if
you
are
so
lucky
now
i
need
another
34
bottles
to
sit
on
and
see
how
they
are
in
a
year
or
two
great
barleywine
picked
this
up
thanks
to
a
gentleman
visiting
from
milwaukee
thus
week
tastes
like
a
clone
of
abacus
which
is
to
say
i
think
its
delicious
pours
dark
browruby
with
a
creamy
white
head
smells
outstanding
vanilla
toffee
and
bourbon
predominate
the
flavor
follows
but
is
a
touch
too
hot
and
boozy
for
my
taste
resulting
in
a
slightly
diminished
score
body
is
fairly
thick
with
perfect
low
to
medium
carbonation
for
this
style
overall
a
great
beer
i
wish
it
was
just
a
little
less
hot
overall
this
is
one
delicious
beer
complex
array
of
flavors
keeps
my
palette
intrigued
in
taking
sip
after
sip
my
only
regret
is
that
i
didnt
ask
for
a
couple
bottles
to
cellar
as
i
think
this
will
only
get
better
over
the
next
few
years
and
beyond
o
a
bit
two
dimensional
caramel
and
bourbon
but
some
brown
sugar
sweetness
comes
in
to
add
a
bit
to
the
complexity
stays
fairly
dry
solid
o
one
of
my
favorite
barrel
aged
barleywines
to
date
i
wish
there
was
more
of
this
around
but
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
highly
recommended
o
awesome
nose
and
potential
for
a
great
flavor
profile
but
this
one
needs
some
time
on
the
shelf
for
the
booze
to
mellow
out
it
really
is
quite
dominating
throughout
most
of
the
drink
and
takes
away
from
the
flavor
intricacies
interestingly
i
recently
had
the
non
barrel
aged
version
of
this
beer
and
didnt
note
it
to
be
particularly
boozy
at
all
i
do
however
think
that
one
was
a
2011
bottle
i
would
like
to
get
my
hands
on
a
couple
more
of
these
throw
them
in
the
cellar
and
come
back
in
a
year
or
two
i
think
they
could
be
great
then
o
awesome
one
that
i
look
forward
to
having
again
soon
poured
into
a
tulip
pours
a
cloudy
mahogany
with
a
thin
beige
head
on
top
nose
is
bursting
with
bourbon
wood
vanilla
toffee
really
nice
smooth
feel
a
bit
heavy
but
for
the
style
thats
okay
this
beer
is
like
liquid
butterscotch
some
caramel
toffee
vanilla
beans
sweet
bourbon
double
dang
this
beer
is
amazing
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
consumed
fresh
from
my
experience
loved
it
thanks
wyatt
o
i
have
4
or
so
of
these
left
and
definitely
thing
they
will
benefit
from
some
extended
time
aging
delicious
an
excellent
bourbon
barrelaged
barleywine
overall
a
well
executed
example
of
the
style
o
not
bad
at
all
but
not
really
my
thing
flavorful
barleywine
tasty
stuff
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
could
help
stir
up
more
complexities
but
no
complaints
here
nice
way
to
cap
off
a
night
not
a
bad
beer
a
little
bit
much
as
warms
up
d
i
love
bourbon
and
vanilla
notes
in
beer
and
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
with
the
high
abv
this
is
a
nightcapper
for
sure
extremely
drinkable
even
with
the
big
abv
o
fantastic
ba
barleywine
in
the
smell
and
flavor
department
big
sweets
are
not
cloying
as
the
bourbon
really
cuts
it
and
the
body
isnt
over
the
top
could
definitely
use
some
more
time
to
let
the
alcohol
settle
down
though
glad
i
still
have
a
couple
left
i
will
revisit
them
in
a
year
or
two
o
this
beer
could
have
been
so
much
better
imo
if
it
had
a
thicker
body
and
a
bit
more
chewy
feel
very
good
regardless
though
i
obtained
two
bottles
of
this
through
a
trade
and
i
plan
to
age
the
other
bottle
for
about
a
year
or
two
to
see
how
it
turns
out
hopefully
the
booziness
weakens
while
bourbon
aroma
remains
great
beer
exceptional
babarleywine
although
i
would
definitely
put
this
one
in
the
english
barleywine
category
its
not
the
barrel
aging
that
makes
it
american
as
weyerbacher
insanity
would
prove
will
let
the
other
bottle
weather
for
at
least
a
year
or
two
so
far
im
really
digging
this
brewery
wish
we
saw
them
in
pennsylvania
highly
recommended
medium
to
full
body
with
excellent
carbonation
helps
to
lighten
it
up
and
brighten
flavors
there
is
a
bit
of
heat
on
the
back
of
the
throat
on
the
swallow
and
in
your
belly
but
an
excellent
sipping
beer
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
food
and
friends
in
philadelphia
the
strength
is
homage
to
the
virile
flavors
thank
you
for
the
latenight
sipping
pleasure
o
i
was
not
expecting
this
to
taste
like
it
did
being
that
it
is
classified
as
an
american
barleywine
i
expected
more
hop
bite
but
got
more
sweetness
that
i
get
from
the
english
style
since
i
tend
to
enjoy
the
english
version
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
to
me
overall
i
really
liked
how
the
alcohol
and
the
bourbon
are
not
overly
dominating
but
do
play
nice
with
the
sweet
and
oak
characters
poured
from
12oz
bottle
2011
vintage
into
a
snifter
glass
pours
hazy
and
dark
red
appearance
with
a
small
tan
head
decent
thin
lacing
throughout
there
was
a
rich
thick
caramel
bourbon
aroma
along
with
dark
fruit
like
plums
good
amount
of
toffee
and
vanilla
the
flavor
is
quite
rich
and
fairly
boozy
from
the
bourbon
especially
when
the
beer
warms
up
but
nice
theres
a
ton
of
dark
fruit
plums
figs
dark
grapes
dates
in
the
flavor
along
with
a
ton
of
vanilla
oak
sweet
booze
and
toffee
sticky
medium
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
fine
example
of
a
barleywine
look
forward
to
the
next
try
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
if
king
henry
is
a
clear
cut
above
this
i
really
gotta
try
king
henry
overall
didnt
live
up
to
expectations
at
all
though
quite
boozy
the
flavor
is
definitely
there
for
the
taking
its
a
shame
that
the
body
is
too
light
and
abrasive
to
really
let
the
flavors
take
center
stage
again
like
other
central
waters
brews
the
look
and
feel
fail
quite
miserably
still
very
happy
to
try
this
highly
acclaimed
beer
though
so
thanks
again
for
the
chance
sliverx
o
id
be
happy
drinking
this
all
year
very
solid
bal
barleywine
o
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
takes
this
beer
to
another
level
very
solid
barleywine
well
done
oa
delicious
sipping
barleywine
with
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
o
reall
impressed
by
this
offering
from
cw
a
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
and
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
i
will
likely
trade
for
this
again
highly
recommended
cheers
o
a
sipper
for
sure
very
solid
brew
for
sure
ill
try
to
hunt
this
one
done
again
having
heard
so
much
about
this
beer
and
finally
getting
to
try
it
i
can
say
for
sure
now
that
this
most
definitely
lives
up
to
the
hype
really
great
fresh
and
i
cant
even
imaging
how
this
would
be
with
a
couple
of
years
on
it
an
amazing
beer
through
and
through
o
3
5
i
preferred
it
fresh
othis
is
one
fine
beer
twelve
ounces
may
be
a
bit
much
just
because
of
how
rich
it
is
o
excellent
beer
should
have
aged
it
or
had
it
colder
than
cellar
temperature
will
be
buying
more
of
this
soon
o
a
surprisingly
great
barleywine
that
i
can
see
only
getting
better
with
time
an
absolute
knockout
of
a
brew
the
price
is
a
amazing
for
the
quality
of
the
product
also
a
sipper
for
sure
but
an
absolute
pleasure
of
one
a
little
bourbon
heavy
which
i
dont
mind
but
i
would
like
to
get
a
better
understanding
of
the
base
beer
its
pretty
hard
to
distinguish
from
the
big
bourbon
notes
o
cw
does
a
great
job
with
their
barrels
but
after
trying
a
number
of
their
barrel
aged
stouts
they
dont
seem
to
be
able
to
get
the
base
beer
right
making
it
a
barrel
drink
to
me
this
does
both
of
them
correctly
the
barlywine
is
a
fine
base
and
the
barrels
are
outstanding
this
is
the
barrel
aged
beer
ive
been
looking
for
from
central
waters
wow
great
great
great
barleywine
glad
i
have
a
few
more
awesome
use
of
the
barrel
o
im
not
generally
a
huge
fan
of
the
superheavy
beers
but
i
appreciated
this
one
as
a
kind
of
nightcap
sipping
it
over
a
long
period
of
time
overall
this
is
a
smooth
beer
given
how
new
it
is
nice
flavors
from
the
barrel
i
would
definitely
have
another
o
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
top
barrel
aged
barley
wines
in
my
opinion
it
has
all
the
components
that
i
look
for
in
this
style
with
some
age
i
believe
the
heat
will
be
subdued
and
this
will
truly
become
an
amazing
offering
o
its
a
solid
beer
a
for
me
for
sure
central
waters
barrel
program
is
killing
it
for
me
o
this
one
went
pretty
quickly
in
spite
of
the
abv
its
not
quite
at
the
level
of
abacus
or
moas
but
its
pretty
close
and
a
a
third
or
quarter
of
the
price
amazing
that
they
can
keep
the
cost
so
low
well
worth
seeking
out
and
glad
i
have
another
4pack
on
the
way
thanks
aaron
o
very
impressive
pretty
damn
good
drinkability
too
considering
what
it
is
bummed
i
only
picked
up
a
single
of
this
and
i
need
to
try
the
base
beer
o
not
quite
the
beer
i
was
expecting
but
i
must
admit
it
is
much
more
drinkable
than
most
bourbon
barreled
beers
o
big
sweet
burnt
sugary
and
boozey
the
whiskey
character
is
a
little
too
forward
which
is
obscuring
the
base
barleywine
surely
some
aging
is
in
order
overall
its
a
rather
tasty
english
barleywine
even
with
the
booze
o
this
beer
starts
out
with
a
very
warm
and
inviting
aroma
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
a
nice
alcohol
warmth
followed
by
a
little
bit
of
bourbon
and
lots
of
caramel
very
smooth
for
a
bourbon
aged
brew
loved
it
pours
a
hazy
burgundy
with
a
modest
offwhite
and
lovely
thin
beading
the
nose
is
pretty
massive
caramel
dark
fruit
booze
toffee
some
licorice
sweet
grains
quite
a
bit
going
on
evolving
with
warmth
the
taste
is
big
on
the
sweeter
darker
malt
notes
the
barrel
does
play
a
very
dominant
role
but
it
definitely
brings
the
beer
in
a
different
direction
the
booze
hits
harder
than
i
would
expect
which
was
also
the
case
with
their
ba
stout
very
good
nonetheless
o
i
havent
had
many
barleywines
cause
i
dont
really
enjoy
the
style
all
that
much
but
i
found
this
one
very
very
good
this
would
pair
especially
with
some
cheese
and
not
just
cause
its
called
a
barleywine
instead
of
cheese
i
had
popcorn
bourbon
barrel
barley
wine
pours
a
deep
redish
color
with
a
nice
white
lacing
head
there
is
a
very
full
sweet
wine
like
smell
very
bousey
the
taste
has
a
strong
wine
like
grape
flavors
and
a
strong
wood
like
flavor
very
strong
alcohol
flavor
its
way
to
booze
to
enjoy
another
one
and
hard
to
drink
overall
a
very
interesting
barley
wine
might
need
to
be
aged
for
a
while
absolutely
one
of
the
best
bal
barley
wines
ive
ever
had
despite
its
rich
character
it
never
gets
overpowering
sweet
and
the
bourbon
is
integrated
perfectly
o
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
one
worthy
of
the
praise
it
recieves
the
only
problem
i
had
was
drinking
it
it
tastes
and
feels
great
but
it
is
a
sipper
in
every
sense
of
the
word
i
m
loving
sitting
down
at
the
crib
with
this
one
on
a
sunday
night
o
wow
im
a
bw
fan
and
love
barrel
beers
5s
are
very
tempting
i
like
the
base
kosmyk
charlies
catastrophe
ale
and
barrelizing
it
is
just
awesome
might
be
too
boozy
for
some
but
high
on
my
totem
pole
why
we
drink
beer
o
this
beer
definitely
improved
in
the
bourbon
barrels
the
taste
was
more
balanced
easier
to
drink
and
overall
more
enjoyable
both
are
good
beers
this
one
is
just
better
and
i
would
seek
it
out
again
4
pours
a
ruby
amber
with
an
offwhite
two
finger
head
aromas
of
oak
dark
fruit
and
hints
of
bourbon
and
booze
are
clearly
present
caramel
malts
dominate
at
first
and
become
much
more
pronounced
as
this
brew
warms
along
with
black
cherries
plum
and
fig
the
finish
is
slightly
sweet
with
bourbon
notes
and
booze
heavy
body
supported
by
huge
malt
backbone
syrupy
with
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
wonderful
ba
barleywine
and
the
perfect
sipping
brew
im
laying
a
few
down
in
the
cellar
to
enjoy
next
winter
this
ber
is
a
ruby
red
rusty
color
short
just
off
white
head
recedes
to
a
film
and
then
a
ring
around
the
glass
fairly
quickly
aroma
is
very
caramel
and
burnt
sugar
forward
with
some
coconut
and
vanilla
from
the
bourbon
barrel
there
is
also
some
toffee
and
a
bit
of
fruitiness
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
bourbon
and
caramel
forward
with
some
nice
biscuity
malted
milk
ball
character
the
main
attraction
here
however
is
the
big
sweet
caramel
paired
with
a
more
vanilla
and
coconut
bourbon
character
mouthfeel
is
big
heavy
and
sticky
but
a
nice
bit
of
carbonation
lifts
the
beer
up
and
keeps
it
from
being
cloying
thanks
to
duff27
for
this
one
o
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
barleywines
and
this
was
my
first
barrel
aged
for
sure
having
said
that
i
found
this
quite
impressive
and
would
certainly
seek
it
out
again
o
really
great
beer
especially
given
its
price
and
availability
i
was
blown
away
by
the
quality
of
this
beer
drank
it
next
to
the
base
beer
y2k
and
while
both
great
you
can
really
see
the
advantages
of
barrel
aging
an
enjoyable
heavily
bourbonized
sipper
of
a
barley
wine
fruits
and
caramel
sweetness
come
out
very
well
with
the
hops
and
wood
providing
a
nice
finish
bourbon
notes
are
clear
and
complex
the
big
drawback
here
is
how
hot
it
is
and
that
it
is
represented
in
the
aroma
flavor
and
finish
it
constantly
reminds
you
how
hot
the
beer
is
maybe
some
time
in
the
cellar
would
have
helped
too
bad
i
only
have
one
overall
more
so
than
most
bourbon
barrel
beers
which
are
often
stouts
this
is
truly
a
showcase
for
the
bourbon
making
the
beer
secondary
this
makes
for
a
mighty
tasty
barleywine
but
one
that
is
slightly
hampered
by
sweetness
and
alcohol
o
a
solid
barely
wine
but
a
bit
overly
bitter
in
the
finish
for
me
o
expected
great
things
from
this
and
it
delivered
smooth
easy
drinking
barleywine
with
a
ton
of
depth
and
flavor
overall
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
but
ends
up
being
good
drinkable
and
not
too
heavy
o
pretty
good
barleywine
here
it
definitely
needs
some
age
as
it
drinks
pretty
hot
right
now
lots
of
nice
flavors
though
and
an
assertive
hop
profile
to
boot
o
overall
i
liked
this
beer
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
any
means
but
having
the
ability
to
have
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywine
of
this
quality
on
a
constant
basis
is
nice
d
this
is
an
excellent
deal
however
it
could
use
a
little
more
work
to
integrate
the
flavors
properly
ill
definitely
keep
chasing
it
down
in
the
future
but
its
not
a
beer
i
need
in
large
quantities
i
like
this
approximately
on
par
with
abacus
this
one
is
more
flavorful
and
less
boozy
but
abacus
has
a
better
finish
the
cost
tips
it
in
cws
favor
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
its
probably
the
most
bourbon
forward
bw
ive
had
to
the
point
it
could
almost
be
mistaken
for
a
bourbon
but
for
carbonation
its
a
great
beer
to
cap
off
a
night
this
is
a
very
fine
barleywine
im
going
to
let
my
remaining
bottles
sit
in
the
hopes
that
the
bourbon
kick
in
the
finish
will
mellow
out
i
find
it
darn
tasty
but
a
bit
hot
the
base
barleywine
is
quite
good
on
its
own
and
it
shows
through
well
here
and
blends
well
with
the
bourbon
overall
an
excellent
barleywine
and
i
hope
it
gets
even
better
with
more
age
if
only
i
can
hold
on
to
this
a
little
longer
o
this
is
a
really
good
barleywine
all
the
big
sweet
malty
biscuity
hoppy
flavors
are
present
in
mass
quantities
the
touch
of
oak
and
bourbon
finishes
it
our
really
nicely
for
how
hefty
and
boozy
this
beer
is
its
pretty
drinkable
notes
complex
as
all
hell
with
full
body
and
a
ton
of
flavor
at
11
5
alcohol
is
definitely
a
factor
in
its
drinkability
a
true
sipper
needless
to
say
now
that
i
have
tried
this
brew
it
is
hands
down
the
best
release
i
have
ever
had
from
central
waters
truly
well
done
ill
be
searching
for
this
one
next
year
and
buy
a
few
to
age
as
well
o
much
like
central
waters
other
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
this
is
a
brew
that
whiskeybourbon
lovers
will
truly
fall
in
love
with
especially
if
hard
liquor
is
there
go
to
drink
because
this
beer
definitely
packs
a
noticeable
punch
while
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
i
find
that
i
dont
really
care
for
the
taste
of
bourbon
in
a
barley
wine
i
would
personally
say
that
the
bourbon
flavor
almost
slightly
ruins
the
delicious
taste
of
charlies
y2k
catastrophe
ale
which
i
am
pretty
certain
is
the
barley
wine
used
for
this
because
of
the
high
price
of
this
beer
i
dont
think
im
going
to
buy
this
again
although
that
all
depends
on
how
this
turns
out
since
i
plan
on
aging
a
bottle
for
a
good
few
years
cost
11
99
for
a
four
pack
do
its
really
hard
to
say
anything
negative
about
central
waters
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
uhhhh
perhaps
it
doesnt
have
good
drinkability
nevermind
that
though
this
one
is
meant
for
sipping
and
savoring
i
feel
this
one
may
be
best
split
with
a
friend
for
most
o
i
like
this
a
lot
by
no
means
is
this
a
king
henry
but
still
delicious
once
cw
figures
out
a
way
to
thicken
their
barrel
aged
beer
i
will
buy
tons
of
them
and
hoared
them
all
overall
a
very
impressive
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
i
really
need
to
try
and
find
more
of
these
a
tasty
beer
with
literally
zero
alcohol
taste
and
just
slight
warming
well
done
o
overall
if
alcohol
burn
isnt
a
deal
breaker
for
you
this
is
a
good
beer
great
for
a
cold
winter
night
like
tonight
warms
you
up
ill
definitely
sit
on
one
and
see
where
its
at
later
but
a
hot
barleywine
fresh
along
with
some
nice
barleywine
as
well
as
barrel
notes
in
this
beer
o
this
may
be
my
first
bourbon
aged
barley
wine
im
really
not
sure
it
is
pretty
amazing
though
i
look
forward
to
aging
a
few
bottles
of
this
and
see
what
happens
o
this
is
a
winner
it
builds
on
an
already
great
y2k
base
with
bourbon
caramel
vanilla
and
oakwho
doesnt
like
that
this
is
perhaps
only
second
up
to
fourteen
fourteen
as
the
greatest
of
central
waters
offering
o
awesome
the
time
of
the
year
when
this
and
its
stout
counterpart
come
out
make
me
happy
i
live
in
wisconsin
definitely
world
class
in
my
book
o
warming
helps
release
the
qualities
of
this
american
barleywine
as
cellaring
likely
will
as
well
one
of
the
highest
ranked
wi
brews
on
ba
it
is
balanced
and
has
real
substance
and
depth
making
it
one
to
seek
out
and
sample
liftbridge
commander
is
great
for
similar
reasons
i
sense
a
blind
tasting
coming
up
overall
flat
out
fantastic
i
thought
bbs
was
going
to
steal
the
show
this
year
but
this
one
is
better
another
beer
by
cw
that
will
fail
to
get
the
hype
that
other
breweries
like
goose
island
or
founders
gets
but
they
make
a
beer
that
is
easily
as
good
as
these
breweries
make
im
excited
to
see
how
this
one
ages
smell
is
is
definately
roasted
malts
dark
fruits
are
pretty
dominant
as
well
really
a
nice
mix
of
roast
and
dark
fruits
that
interact
really
well
taste
is
not
as
nice
as
the
nose
there
is
definately
some
strong
hops
that
take
over
the
taste
the
hops
arent
bitter
at
all
and
actually
balance
things
nice
however
i
think
there
is
just
too
much
hops
for
me
the
hops
seem
to
be
too
strong
no
doubt
this
would
be
better
with
some
age
gonna
age
the
rest
o
really
good
but
i
think
a
year
or
2
will
do
some
good
alcohol
warming
is
pretty
strong
and
will
likely
mellow
over
time
still
very
good
now
though
so
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
and
so
stoked
its
finally
come
to
minnesota
o
i
like
it
a
lot
cant
complain
much
thank
you
lots
central
waters
and
your
team
wow
this
beer
is
another
one
that
makes
me
happy
to
live
in
wisconsin
i
would
put
this
up
against
pretty
much
any
other
barlywine
that
is
out
the
bourbon
really
works
nice
if
you
are
a
bourbon
aged
fan
this
is
just
about
perfect
overall
a
great
beer
as
with
any
barleywine
i
think
it
needs
a
good
year
to
really
be
at
its
peak
the
alcohol
just
overpowers
the
bourbon
at
this
point
but
i
have
no
doubt
this
will
improve
with
time
i
will
get
more
of
these
if
i
can
edit
had
my
first
bottle
from
the
2013
vintage
tonight
central
waters
advertised
the
fact
that
with
this
years
bourbon
barrel
stout
they
aged
it
for
twice
as
long
in
the
bourbon
barrels
there
were
rumors
that
all
of
their
bourbon
barrel
beers
were
aged
for
twice
as
long
as
in
previous
years
whatever
the
case
this
years
version
of
the
bb
barleywine
is
so
much
smoother
than
last
years
i
will
have
to
do
a
side
by
side
comparison
to
be
sure
but
as
good
as
last
years
was
there
was
always
a
slight
harshness
to
each
sip
that
is
totally
gone
this
year
as
the
bourbon
integrates
so
much
better
with
all
of
the
wonderful
barleywine
flavors
in
this
beer
and
we
have
nailed
it
central
waters
bourbon
barrel
barley
wine
i
love
this
beer
and
it
is
always
a
want
thanks
alwatcher
its
amazing
how
i
have
never
picked
up
on
the
hops
as
much
until
now
bottles
234
to
come
had
ontap
at
the
norse
this
came
out
dark
with
red
highlights
and
smelled
like
woody
cherries
and
bourbon
taste
is
very
sweet
with
ripe
fruit
flavors
vanilla
lots
of
caramel
and
oaked
wood
i
like
the
fact
that
the
bourbon
isnt
overwhelming
and
that
the
beer
gets
more
and
more
complex
as
it
warms
im
also
genuinely
surprised
at
the
11
5
abvthis
was
so
smooth
so
light
so
easy
to
drink
i
dont
normally
love
this
style
but
this
i
would
have
again
in
a
second
o
a
very
nicely
done
bbbw
the
barrel
presence
was
solid
and
the
heat
really
played
nicely
with
the
other
surrounding
flavors
i
do
wish
the
body
of
the
beer
was
a
little
heavier
though
i
had
to
come
back
and
add
to
this
review
this
beer
really
got
better
as
it
warmed
i
sat
there
watching
tv
drinking
this
and
the
bourbon
notes
really
got
complex
this
is
a
hot
beer
and
needs
some
age
but
none
the
less
fantastic
4
5
d
i
wish
i
reviewed
this
when
it
was
fresh
the
scores
would
have
been
a
good
bit
higher
im
curious
as
to
whether
this
is
in
the
awkward
phase
right
now
or
if
it
just
doesnt
age
well
in
any
case
even
this
aged
bottle
was
very
tasty
poured
a
slightly
hazed
caramel
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
reduced
to
a
ringlet
aroma
of
caramel
and
sweet
malts
dark
fruits
bourbon
alcohol
warning
taste
is
sweet
and
cakey
woody
bourbon
rum
raisin
figs
and
black
cherries
finishing
with
a
mild
seemingly
hoppy
fruit
character
as
in
the
aroma
alcohols
presence
is
noticeable
it
is
a
bourbonaged
barleywine
so
would
you
expect
it
to
be
otherwise
heavymedium
body
chewy
and
quite
drinkable
o
this
is
a
very
impressive
ba
barleywine
smooth
drinking
and
enjoyable
overall
this
is
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
flavors
are
rich
complex
and
for
almost
12
percent
nowhere
near
overbearing
only
flaw
to
this
beer
is
that
the
alcohol
was
definitely
there
not
that
i
dont
mind
it
but
it
prevented
me
from
giving
this
beer
5
in
some
categories
i
sampled
this
vintage
at
about
11
months
old
hopefully
i
can
find
some
more
of
this
barleywine
and
revisit
it
in
another
year
o
my
experience
with
barleywines
is
limited
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
tasted
i
would
love
to
try
one
with
a
little
more
age
on
it
as
it
seems
this
will
only
get
better
this
beer
pours
a
nice
reddish
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
sticky
head
bthe
smell
is
caramel
bourbon
and
a
nice
boozy
sweetness
the
flavor
follows
suit
and
is
almost
like
a
bourbon
county
stout
but
a
barleywine
the
flavors
a
bold
and
the
bourbon
is
in
your
face
and
hot
mouthfeel
is
warm
medium
thick
and
delicious
overall
a
very
good
barleywine
can
wait
to
have
it
with
some
age
on
it
very
enjoyable
beer
one
i
wish
i
had
immediate
access
too
while
cwbbbw
would
struggle
to
compete
with
the
top
tier
barrel
aged
barleywines
it
is
an
impressive
beer
none
the
less
a
bit
of
a
fuller
body
slightly
more
depth
and
heat
dialed
down
it
would
be
spot
on
excellent
beer
worth
seeking
out
drink
any
2011s
you
have
now
d
solid
barleywine
here
the
barrel
aging
is
really
well
integrated
into
the
flavors
here
and
elevates
this
to
a
solid
barleywine
i
wish
i
had
a
couple
more
bottles
of
this
nostrovya
bottle
poured
a
deep
copper
color
ale
with
a
quite
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
light
bourbon
notes
with
the
typical
vanilla
notes
and
some
sweet
caramelized
malt
notes
taste
is
a
nice
mix
between
some
sweet
though
not
overly
so
notes
of
caramelized
brown
sugar
with
some
notes
bourbon
and
vanilla
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
easily
drinkable
with
good
balance
and
level
of
complexity
i
cannot
believe
that
this
bottle
was
so
young
as
the
flavors
have
settled
so
nicely
already
an
excellent
barrelaged
barleywine
one
i
will
absolutely
seek
out
again
despite
the
misperceptions
listed
above
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
id
like
to
have
again
with
a
little
more
age
on
it
if
possible
just
my
second
beer
from
central
waters
and
i
look
forward
to
more
a
unique
and
boldly
flavorful
brew
full
on
bourbon
oak
profile
with
sweet
toasty
malts
the
only
knock
is
the
astringent
alcohol
presence
some
more
ageing
should
take
care
of
that
well
worth
seeking
out
o
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
at
50
degrees
the
flavors
are
a
bit
muted
but
the
flavors
really
come
alive
as
this
beer
reaches
room
temperature
really
enjoying
this
one
despite
the
abv
this
one
drinks
exceptionally
well
but
its
also
a
great
sipper
as
well
glad
i
have
a
few
more
of
these
4
5
really
a
rocking
ba
barleywine
here
i
will
require
more
of
these
this
is
one
of
the
best
bourbon
barreled
barley
wines
i
have
had
i
will
definitely
be
tracking
down
more
big
thanks
to
seeswo
for
the
trade
served
at
53
degrees
in
a
tulip
bottled
on
january
2011
indicated
on
the
label
pours
a
bright
amber
hue
with
candy
apple
highlights
clarity
is
almost
translucent
but
theres
a
slight
haze
head
is
an
18th
of
an
inch
loose
and
creamcolored
and
immediately
dissipates
into
a
thin
band
around
the
shoulders
some
short
strands
of
lacing
are
revealed
during
the
tasting
love
the
nose
on
this
beer
bourbon
buttery
notes
sugary
and
candied
fruits
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
theres
definitely
an
alcohol
presence
here
its
still
a
little
hot
but
not
in
a
bad
way
theres
also
some
hops
bitterness
that
manifests
towards
the
back
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
a
slightly
oily
consistency
that
is
somewhat
masked
by
an
assertive
carbonation
theres
definitely
some
residual
alcohol
heat
overall
this
is
a
top
notch
beer
im
glad
i
opened
it
but
would
love
to
see
what
a
few
years
does
to
it
that
said
if
you
like
the
hops
character
in
a
your
american
barleywines
open
it
sooner
than
later
however
this
one
is
really
going
to
open
up
over
time
in
my
opinion
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
unfortunately
the
only
other
two
ba
barleywines
i
have
to
compare
it
to
is
abacus
and
ba
decadence
both
are
among
my
favorite
beers
and
some
of
the
top
in
the
style
very
enjoyable
though
o
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
would
love
to
try
a
09
or
10
vintage
to
see
how
this
beer
ages
and
smooths
out
will
be
looking
for
the
12
when
it
comes
out
early
next
year
overall
one
of
the
best
american
barleywines
ive
ever
had
the
hops
seem
a
bit
faded
which
is
perfect
for
me
for
comparisons
sake
fresh
bigfoot
has
a
bit
more
hop
character
to
it
than
i
prefer
and
i
picked
the
perfect
time
to
open
this
one
as
they
have
mellowed
precisely
again
a
big
thanks
to
rowingbrewer
for
this
one
i
need
to
acquire
more
of
this
now
o
a
very
nice
barleywine
recommended
would
like
to
have
this
again
edit
72012
just
opened
another
bottle
from
210
and
all
the
heat
i
mentioned
in
my
review
is
gone
another
year
in
the
cellar
has
done
wonders
o
really
nice
barleywine
sweet
malty
bourbony
good
stuff
overall
a
really
outstanding
barleywine
and
exactly
what
i
was
in
the
mood
for
when
i
picked
it
out
for
tonight
plenty
of
barrel
and
bourbon
throughout
but
without
being
overly
boozy
i
really
liked
the
hop
note
that
balanced
the
heavy
malt
and
kept
this
from
being
cloying
really
delicious
the
only
barrel
aged
barleywine
i
can
definitively
say
i
enjoyed
more
was
abacus
but
i
much
preferred
the
serving
size
of
this
at
only
12
oz
i
will
definitely
seek
out
more
to
drink
fresh
and
for
the
cellar
central
waters
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
pours
a
completely
opaque
mahogany
with
a
towering
pile
of
light
tan
foam
sitting
atop
the
beer
its
shoots
past
four
fingers
in
height
settles
back
down
to
about
that
and
just
sits
there
it
legitimately
took
five
mininutes
for
the
foam
to
recede
and
leaves
gobs
and
gobs
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
very
heavy
on
caramelized
sugar
and
toffee
with
the
only
evidence
of
the
time
spent
in
barrels
being
a
light
touch
of
vanilla
that
stays
in
the
background
the
flavor
brings
the
barrel
aging
a
bit
more
into
focus
toffee
and
lightly
burnt
sugar
are
still
the
foundation
of
the
flavor
profile
but
the
vanilla
secondary
note
from
the
aroma
is
joined
by
a
pleasant
mild
bourbon
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
a
full
rich
body
paired
with
carbonation
that
just
keeps
the
beer
from
being
syrupy
yet
lets
the
malt
shine
i
love
me
a
barrel
aged
barleywine
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
smooth
rich
and
big
something
to
sip
and
savor
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
deep
redishbrown
with
a
tiny
white
head
small
bubbles
floating
up
even
after
the
head
fades
great
lacing
smells
like
vanilla
toffe
with
dark
fruits
and
a
little
oaky
scent
taste
is
amazing
big
bourbon
vanilla
upfront
blends
very
well
with
the
sweet
maltyness
of
the
barleywine
mouthfeel
is
great
for
a
strong
barleywine
not
huge
carbonation
but
its
nice
for
the
style
just
enough
overall
amazing
beer
i
really
wish
i
had
more
than
the
one
bottle
thanks
dyan
for
the
hookup
o
a
really
nice
bourbonforward
barleywine
such
a
treat
o
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
hop
flavor
from
an
american
barleywine
especially
one
this
fresh
but
this
one
tips
the
scales
in
favor
of
the
malt
and
bourbon
aging
i
think
with
time
it
will
calm
down
a
little
and
balance
out
a
little
more
either
way
it
big
boozy
and
definitely
a
solid
barleywine
o
this
was
a
longtime
want
of
mine
in
what
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
wanted
to
have
this
mellowed
out
a
touch
more
the
bourbon
was
unmistakable
if
you
really
take
your
time
with
this
there
are
lots
of
complexities
that
come
out
well
done
central
waters
o
easily
the
best
bargain
in
barrel
aged
beer
alliteration
bonus
points
if
it
was
available
all
year
id
probably
buy
two
4packs
a
month
a
strong
showing
from
the
flagship
beer
of
one
of
the
best
breweries
around
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
drank
with
lots
of
other
barleys
so
i
felt
a
sweetness
overload
overall
overpowering
sharp
alcohol
not
my
liking
d
might
have
opened
this
one
a
little
early
with
a
little
time
i
could
see
this
being
great
decent
now
but
ill
sit
on
the
other
one
i
have
o
good
but
a
bit
sweet
and
booze
driven
at
times
barrel
hides
the
base
beer
for
a
good
portion
of
drinking
honestly
thought
a
little
too
hot
at
times
pretty
good
but
the
bourbon
flavor
was
a
bit
too
strong
for
me
it
may
be
that
this
vintage
was
too
fresh
for
my
tastes
ill
have
to
give
an
aged
vintage
a
shot
sometime
soon
overall
very
nice
nice
melding
of
the
complex
flavors
not
one
dimensional
and
doesnt
taste
layered
very
nice
pours
a
murky
iced
tea
color
with
a
huge
3
inch
light
orange
head
that
fades
to
a
chunky
cap
on
the
top
of
the
beer
nice
distinct
thin
rings
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
brown
sugar
toffee
biscuity
malt
bourbon
along
with
some
wood
notes
taste
is
of
bourbon
and
wood
up
front
with
brown
sugar
and
malt
coming
through
in
the
middle
and
some
nice
citrus
zest
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
a
creamy
yet
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
with
nice
balanced
bourbon
flavors
that
dont
overpower
the
traditional
barleywine
smells
and
tastes
poured
into
my
stone
tulip
a
gratis
bottle
thanks
ewright
this
bal
barleywine
pours
with
almost
zero
head
the
color
is
a
murky
darkish
reddish
brownish
the
smell
here
makes
the
beer
again
with
a
great
smelling
fair
tasting
bb
barleywine
i
love
the
oak
vanilla
caramel
on
the
nose
to
a
lesser
degree
i
get
some
piney
hoppiness
and
orange
peel
as
well
the
flavor
doesnt
back
it
up
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
malts
which
should
be
good
but
im
not
getting
the
balance
of
hops
i
thought
i
smelled
it
has
a
little
caramel
but
not
much
vanilla
and
is
intensely
bitter
and
alcoholic
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
good
mild
carbonation
creamy
milky
coating
not
syrupy
cloying
overall
a
solid
take
on
the
style
but
not
the
best
ive
had
i
could
go
for
some
more
malty
notes
and
maybe
a
bit
more
barrel
flavor
i
think
i
would
enjoy
it
more
if
it
wasnt
aged
anyhow
its
still
a
decent
beer
and
i
see
why
people
enjoy
it
its
especially
nice
that
it
comes
in
12oz
bottles
worth
trying
ill
have
to
try
another
to
see
if
i
notice
differences
i
was
expecting
more
w
such
great
reviews
o
amazing
brew
plain
and
simple
one
of
the
best
bbbw
ive
ever
had
the
time
down
has
done
wonderful
things
to
this
massive
thanks
goes
out
to
the
person
bm
me
if
it
was
you
and
i
will
give
you
proper
credit
who
shared
this
one
with
the
group
at
the
evening
wood
tasting
graciously
hosted
by
cmrillo
2011
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
a
deep
redorange
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
wood
and
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
wood
and
alcohol
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
however
there
wasnt
anything
really
interesting
going
on
in
it
to
make
it
overly
memoriable
the
flavor
did
however
mix
and
compliment
each
other
quite
well
pretty
smooth
for
an
11
5
heavy
hitter
definitely
worth
trying
tastes
are
unbelieveable
malty
sweetness
breadcrumbs
yeast
brown
sugar
sherry
bourbon
wine
sediment
hops
american
crystal
mugwort
and
flowers
smells
are
brown
sugar
booze
straightup
booze
cornchips
malt
liquor
vanilla
and
mango
slices
very
generous
extra
huge
props
again
to
winsconsinality
would
love
to
get
a
hold
of
this
one
again
full
bodied
somewhat
higher
carbonation
a
bit
creamy
lasting
finish
on
the
tongue
drinks
really
nice
i
was
psyched
to
try
this
and
im
happy
i
have
a
2011
bottle
at
home
to
compare
this
to
122512
2008
vintage
this
has
held
up
pretty
well
tasty
showing
mild
oxidation
more
reminiscent
of
an
old
ale
than
barleywine
with
fruity
character
especially
evident
on
the
nose
this
beer
stands
up
well
to
age
but
is
best
fresh
imho
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
for
the
style
and
carbonation
is
moderate
overall
it
was
a
pretty
solid
beer
but
didnt
really
wow
me
like
some
barrel
aged
barleywines
have
it
felt
a
little
too
juicy
citrusy
and
bitter
as
well
as
boozy
at
times
but
then
also
smooth
and
drinkable
at
times
when
the
malty
flavors
came
out
more
it
had
some
very
nice
high
points
to
it
and
was
a
very
nice
sipping
beer
this
evening
but
fell
a
little
short
of
being
a
truly
world
class
beer
of
the
style
this
fine
brew
pours
a
dark
amber
and
settles
a
ruby
infused
brown
color
oily
legs
cling
to
the
glass
after
an
inch
of
off
white
head
dissipates
the
nose
smells
very
sweet
with
notes
akin
to
caramel
apples
there
is
a
bit
of
a
hop
presence
in
the
aroma
but
nothing
too
strong
the
taste
is
also
very
sweet
with
a
well
masked
alcohol
level
the
oak
and
vanilla
bourbon
characteristics
offered
by
the
oak
barrel
are
shining
through
in
this
beer
but
not
overpowering
you
can
still
taste
the
caramel
and
light
hop
offerings
as
well
some
butter
notes
are
also
picked
up
in
the
flavor
that
add
to
the
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
with
a
suiting
low
amount
of
carbonation
overall
pretty
damn
smooth
for
such
a
brew
and
damn
tasty
as
well
o
simply
not
up
to
par
with
the
competition
25
reveal
is
holy
hell
ive
had
this
central
waters
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
ive
even
had
this
year
it
is
sitting
in
a
review
notebook
somewhere
i
should
find
that
and
compare
overall
this
was
another
week
of
barrel
aged
bliss
from
a
bottle
i
am
super
glad
that
i
decided
to
break
this
out
today
since
it
is
just
a
little
bit
on
the
cooler
side
and
this
made
for
a
fantastic
afternoon
sipper
i
am
going
to
head
outside
for
a
nice
cigar
to
finish
this
baby
up
and
unwind
for
the
rest
of
my
sunday
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
this
or
trade
for
it
id
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
bourbon
barrel
barleywines
i
have
ever
had
so
dont
miss
out
overall
one
of
the
best
barrel
aged
brews
ive
had
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
any
bottles
i
get
from
here
on
out
will
be
consumed
fresh
i
shall
not
age
them
o
favorite
beer
of
2011
thus
far
and
i
am
halfway
through
the
year
this
for
me
will
be
tough
to
beat
damn
near
perfection
to
my
pallet
seek
this
one
out
if
you
are
a
barleywine
fan
thanks
to
splax23
for
this
one
o
good
unexpectedly
interesting
overall
a
pretty
solid
brew
that
i
probably
should
have
tried
fresh
first
to
get
a
baseline
on
overall
an
excellent
bw
many
thanks
for
seeswo
for
the
hookup
this
is
a
truly
great
beer
best
ive
had
from
central
waters
very
impressed
seek
out
o
this
is
an
incredibly
well
balance
bb
barleywine
one
of
my
favourites
so
far
awesome
highly
recommended
this
was
really
nice
the
other
barleywines
ive
tried
have
been
far
too
hoppy
but
this
was
a
wonderful
sweet
thick
treat
i
do
wonder
if
another
couple
of
years
aging
would
cut
the
remaining
bitterness
some
but
even
with
it
this
was
a
treat
pours
a
cloudy
dark
iced
tea
color
with
translucent
edges
and
a
ruby
hue
against
a
white
light
visible
effervescence
sustains
a
shallow
off
eggshell
collar
briefly
while
a
nice
amount
of
spotty
belgian
lacing
adorns
the
glass
the
smell
is
aggressive
and
with
high
standard
quite
classic
a
vanilla
character
from
the
oak
treatment
adds
nicely
to
the
vibrant
sweet
malty
caramel
butterscotch
toffee
brown
sugar
molasses
notes
really
nice
the
flavor
is
very
pronounced
and
sweet
the
full
bodied
texture
vividly
supports
the
overall
experience
the
initial
mouth
feel
was
exceptionally
well
carbonated
especially
for
a
beverage
of
this
style
full
bodied
without
being
syrupy
the
texture
really
adds
a
ton
of
value
to
this
one
the
flavor
is
quite
nice
as
it
reflects
the
nose
yet
has
a
surprisingly
black
licorice
thing
going
on
especially
in
the
really
enjoyable
aftertaste
i
really
enjoyed
considering
this
one
again
many
thanks
to
my
long
lost
minnesota
connection
had
a
chance
to
have
the
2011
sidebyside
with
the
2010
at
a
barrel
aged
tasting
on
20110806
the
2011
is
exactly
as
predicted
the
bourbon
is
very
in
your
face
the
2010
is
much
dryer
and
more
mellow
id
say
this
beer
is
better
with
a
year
on
it
o
a
pretty
good
barleywine
that
thankfully
doesnt
suffer
like
their
two
bourbon
barrel
stouts
the
original
barleywine
flavors
still
come
through
the
barrel
aging
process
which
is
a
quality
their
bbal
stouts
unfortunately
lacked
i
would
be
splitting
hairs
to
say
so
but
the
10
is
drinking
just
a
tad
better
from
age
or
batch
variation
its
hard
to
say
either
year
is
world
class
on
my
palate
and
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
bangbuck
bottles
in
america
easily
i
am
going
to
start
saving
for
next
release
now
o
im
glad
to
see
something
with
bourbon
on
the
label
and
it
not
taste
like
its
over
powered
by
it
this
brew
is
a
good
blend
of
barelywine
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
and
made
for
some
interesting
sipping
a
little
on
the
bittersweet
side
for
taste
however
d
no
not
something
ill
cellar
again
i
liked
the
fresh
version
much
more
this
is
a
really
nice
barleywine
i
wish
this
was
available
to
me
where
i
live
as
itd
be
one
that
id
go
back
to
as
often
as
i
could
thanks
again
alex
very
nice
wish
i
had
more
pours
a
very
mixed
amber
color
seems
to
be
confused
as
to
weather
it
is
red
or
orange
the
head
forms
with
a
bit
of
work
and
head
is
a
nice
tan
color
the
aroma
is
honestly
what
threw
me
for
a
loop
nice
sweet
malts
power
through
with
a
slight
hop
and
bourbon
aroma
in
the
background
a
very
nice
aroma
and
it
made
the
brew
all
the
more
enjoyable
the
taste
was
a
bit
un
balanced
for
me
nothing
that
age
cant
fix
i
feel
with
age
this
brew
would
eventually
balance
out
the
sweet
malt
and
body
i
felt
was
great
but
the
hops
and
bourbon
were
a
bit
over
the
top
the
body
i
felt
was
perfect
and
overall
was
a
very
enjoyable
brew
di
felt
that
this
was
a
great
use
of
a
bourbon
barrel
very
nice
and
balanced
flavor
decently
complex
and
the
mouthfeel
was
very
good
for
what
it
is
drink
this
one
fresh
i
dont
see
much
need
for
age
overall
another
solid
beer
by
central
waters
i
am
becoming
a
big
fan
of
their
beer
i
cant
think
of
a
better
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
that
comes
in
4
pack
format
great
barrel
notes
and
fantastic
malt
profile
deepdeep
mahogany
color
with
a
nice
tight
headbordering
on
black
but
not
quite
so
huge
sweet
malt
aroma
with
a
heavy
hand
of
bourbon
to
boot
very
sweet
almost
spirit
sweet
like
one
of
the
trendy
schnapps
big
and
heavy

flavorsraisens
figs

dried
fruit
huge
caramel
and
toffee
like
flavors
enough
hops
to
be
there
but
this
is
certainly
all
about
the
malt
here
still
holds
a
touch
of
grain
flavor
lingering
spicealmost
cookie
like
huge
body
and
lick
the
lips
sweetness
going
on
a
big
sticky
sweet
mess
that
i
simply
love
body
goes
on
for
miles
just
a
great
great
beer
all
around
a
true
sipper
in
every
sense
of
the
word
just
great
2009
vintage
dont
know
if
this
is
done
each
year
but
oh
what
a
cellarable
beer
im
not
a
big
barleywine
fan
but
this
one
hit
the
spot
its
the
first
bourbon
aged
barleywine
i
have
tried
and
i
would
be
willing
to
try
to
find
more
similar
to
this
drink
and
overall
awesomely
drinkable
high
abv
barleywine
i
like
the
oak
barrel
aging
its
done
alot
for
charlie
fantastic
beer
i
have
a
few
left
and
i
am
going
to
let
them
chill
for
a
year
or
so
the
smell
of
this
beer
grabs
you
more
than
anything
the
bourbon
stands
out
on
the
nose
along
with
on
the
taste
long
afterwards
defiantly
a
slow
drinker
with
the
bitterness
on

drinkability
25
d
drinkability
is
high
although
this
is
a
sipper
to
a
t
i
didnt
once
think
of
finishing
this
beer
and
not
regretting
having
more
i
would
love
to
see
what
this
develops
into
but
fresh
its
still
a
great
beer
drinkability
is
good
right
now
but
as
with
many
barley
wines
that
i
have
tried
i
really
think
this
need
a
year
or
two
before
it
peaks
the
alcohols
are
apparent
in
this
one
but
again
i
think
much
of
the
hot
mouth
feel
will
fade
and
it
will
be
one
hell
of
a
brew
to
enjoy

but
nice
12oz
bottle
courtesy
of
guyinchicago
pours
cloudy
amber
color
with
sediment
and
offwhite
head
aroma
of
candied
sugar
dried
pit
fruit
and
bourbon
taste
is
sweet
almost
like
a
tootsie
pop
with
a
bitter
pop
at
the
end
full
bodied
and
slick
texture
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
fatiguing
and
could
be
toned
down
a
notch
this
one
will
probably
get
better
with
age
nevertheless
a
great
barley
wine
that
will
keep
the
d
train
warm
along
the
tracks
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
like
sipping
on
liquid
caramel
it
is
actually
fairly
hot
on
the
palate
possibly
from
the
alcohol
possibly
from
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
like
i
said
i
think
some
time
will
certainly
help
mellow
this
beer
out
and
bring
out
some
more
of
its
subtle
complexities
i
didnt
realize
the
abv
on
this
bad
boy
was
11
5
until
i
pulled
it
up
on
here
with
this
alcohol
content
the
heat
isnt
much
of
a
surprise
and
this
is
actually
fairly
drinkable
considering
that
d
im
giving
this
one
a
5
on
drinkability
because
it
is
just
so
all
around
amazing
when
its
cold
you
are
able
to
drink
it
somewhat
quick
and
the
flavors
are
slightly
suttle
and
toned
down
but
when
it
warms
you
can
really
just
enjoy
it
and
the
flavors
and
wonderful
and
the
barrel
aging
that
this
brew
has
undergone
really
comes
through
i
love
the
flavors
smell
and
look
of
this
beer
just
an
all
around
amazing
beer
paul
and
his
team
have
done
a
wonderful
job
with
this
and
i
hope
they
keep
up
the
good
work
this
one
only
gets
better
with
age
folks
but
enjoy
one
today
and
see
how
greatness
is
born
db
good
balance
of
oak
barleywine
malts
and
bourbon
flavors
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
again
in
the
future
d
well
balance
beer
with
some
very
redeeming
qualities
d
drink
slowly
pours
a
translucent
cherry
brown
with
a
reasonable
tannishwhite
head
smells
just
fantastic
caramel
vanilla
bourbon
just
knocks
me
outta
the
park
this
is
a
very
fresh
barley
wine
with
hops
in
the
finish
and
big
sweetness
upfront
a
bit
boozy
bourbony
and
just
generally
a
beer
that
needs
some
time
to
calm
down
from
experience
it
doesnt
take
long
for
this
beer
to
mellow
quite
a
bit
based
off
of
this
fresh
and
generally
over
time
this
is
a
barley
wine
for
people
who
like
them
relatively
sweet
very
solid
levels
of
carbonation
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
in
its
current
state
its
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
as
it
mellows
the
sweetness
emerges
putting
a
ceiling
on
the
drinkability
in
general
this
beer
has
well
integrated
bourbon
without
being
a
bourbonbooze
bomb
that
is
on
the
sweeter
side
of
an
already
sweet
style
fantastic
and
thats
before
i
mention
that
you
cant
pay
more
than
312oz
when
its
available
this
beer
looked
a
really
nice
deep
red
heavy
amber
color
with
a
quickly
fading
light
beige
head
that
reduced
to
lacing
on
the
surface
the
smell
its
really
really
a
wonderful
fragrance
there
is
a
honey
brown
sugar
caramel
aroma
along
with
some
hints
of
bourbon
and
vanilla
the
taste
was
nice
sweet
brown
sugar
and
vanilla
flavor
there
were
light
fruit
flavors
hidden
deep
in
back
a
hint
of
oak
flavor
the
taste
when
at
the
perfect
temperature
which
i
assume
to
be
the
intended
serving
temperature
is
a
wonderful
god
like
nectar
either
above
or
below
the
tannins
or
booze
come
out
respectively
this
beer
was
really
easy
to
drink
when
at
the
right
temperature
range
and
i
seriously
wish
that
i
was
saving
more
of
these
bottle
for
myself
because
damn
are
they
tasty
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
prickly
carbonation
but
it
is
lacking
a
little
in
body
a
good
bal
barleywine
and
definitely
a
sipper
ill
probably
let
my
other
bottles
go
for
another
year
or
more
and
see
what
develops
d
more
of
a
sipper
but
plenty
drinkable
a
nice
and
complex
barleywine
with
a
near
perfect
bourbon
blend
would
love
to
try
some
of
these
with
a
couple
years
of
age
on
them
overall
impression
forget
what
it
looks
like
just
close
your
eyes
and
enjoy
excellent
example
of
barrelaging
medium
full
body
light
on
the
carbonation
long
boozy
finish
medium
bodied
with
tight
carbonation
up
front
and
a
good
bit
of
alcohol
heat
that
lingers
throughout
and
warms
the
chest
lots
of
sweet
caramel
malt
with
earthy
leathery
notes
and
slight
bitter
hops
hints
of
caramel
chocolate
toffee
and
biscuit
countered
by
the
bourbon
barrel
notes
sweet
and
boozy
but
not
too
hot
with
plenty
of
bourbon
oak
and
vanilla
as
it
warms
the
heat
tones
down
a
notch
and
the
silky
caramel
toffee
vanilla
and
marshmallow
flavors
become
more
prominent
very
complex
but
a
bit
just
a
touch
too
hot
at
this
stage
i
would
love
to
see
how
this
is
doing
in
another
year
or
two
very
good
but
definitely
a
sipper
wonderfully
complex
this
beer
rewards
repeat
visits
by
revealing
new
depth
with
every
sip
may
be
my
favorite
barleywine
d
good
full
flavored
delicious
and
quite
satisfying
i
cant
wait
to
try
some
of
the
other
offering
from
cw
d
i
found
this
beer
to
be
similar
in
many
regards
to
the
kuhnhenn
brew
i
had
alongside
it
albeit
3
less
abv
id
definitely
have
it
again
d
at
11
or
so
it
is
a
nightcap
a
nice
blend
of
bourbon
and
barleywine
drinkability
is
good
this
glass
went
down
pretty
easy
especially
for
11
5
abv
however
i
think
this
beer
will
be
even
better
with
a
few
years
on
it
definitely
another
stand
out
brew
from
central
waters
and
worth
seeking
out
overall
its
quite
nice
i
dont
know
if
its
on
the
outs
or
has
yet
to
reach
its
peak
but
i
would
love
to
try
some
different
vintages
to
see
where
i
like
it
better
d
good
but
would
not
want
another
d
an
impressive
beer
from
central
waters
good
flavours
and
something
methinks
to
age
for
a
while
the
mouthfeel
is
defined
by
a
creamy
carbonation
and
medium
to
heavy
body
the
beer
is
decadant
as
it
should
be
but
that
hurts
drinkability
a
bit
just
a
fantastic
brew
and
one
i
will
stock
up
on
every
year
when
its
available
drinkability
very
drinkable
for
the
strength
d
though
this
does
taste
good
the
overwhelming
sweetness
without
anything
counterbalance
and
the
lingering
cloying
sweetness
brings
this
way
down
for
me
2010
bottle
pours
a
clear
medium
ruby
with
a
scant
head
nose
is
nice
round
malt
fruit
sugars
bourbon
oak
barrel
mouth
is
fairly
straight
forward
but
is
good
in
its
simplicity
mostly
bourbon
oak
burnt
sugar
i
feel
like
this
is
somewhat
in
the
american
vein
after
having
some
maltier
heavy
ones
like
the
old
stock
reserves
its
the
same
idea
as
wooden
hell
but
without
the
amazing
complexity
and
depth
impressive
all
of
11
5
appropriately
sticky
with
lowmedium
carbonation
this
is
like
bigfoot
in
a
barrel
first
time
ive
had
a
hoppy
barleywine
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
and
it
was
an
experience
id
love
to
try
a
later
vintage
to
see
if
the
hops
fade
enough
for
more
barrel
and
malt
flavors
come
out
drinkability
frankly
a
letdown
incredibly
sweet
with
none
of
the
bourbon
alcohol
character
to
cut
through
it
it
would
be
easy
to
confuse
this
with
say
a
j
w
lees
harvest
ale
homebrew
clone
if
one
didnt
know
what
it
was
certainly
not
terrible
but
does
not
have
the
iota
of
balance
needed
for
a
barleywine
to
be
great
its
caramel
and
some
wood
and
booze
not
a
favorite
note
just
revisited
with
a
year
old
bottle
of
the
2013
and
came
to
the
same
conclusion
even
before
checking
my
review
so
i
guess
i
will
go
against
the
crowd
on
this
one
d
4
i
feel
like
an
old
man
but
i
think
this
beer
could
have
been
helped
if
they
dialed
back
to
maybe
9
5
or
so
still
an
excellent
beer
especially
to
share
after
a
meal
when
its
getting
colder
out
drink
while
wearing
a
sweater
first
actual
beer
rating
so
dont
have
the
lexicon
down
but
this
was
very
tasty
poured
a
nice
dark
amber
color
not
much
head
but
the
server
may
have
poured
some
off
great
nose
with
the
bourbon
integrated
well
on
the
nose
taste
was
outstanding
definitely
could
taste
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
on
this
but
thought
the
malt
and
barrel
aging
had
really
integrated
well
had
this
a
couple
times
from
the
bottle
a
couple
months
ago
and
i
thought
it
was
somewhat
disjointed
on
tap
it
was
so
much
better
the
bourbon
added
some
nice
sweetness
to
it
to
me
this
almost
tasted
and
smelled
like
the
goose
island
bourbon
county
stout
but
in
a
barleywine
d
this
had
a
great
scent
and
taste
somewhat
similar
to
gratitude
but
rough
around
the
edges
definitely
too
hot
and
fresh
with
dominant
alcohol
presence
that
made
this
a
bit
tough
to
sip
the
bourbon
barrel
didnt
come
through
very
much
either
with
only
subtle
toasted
oak
notes
with
some
age
this
could
develop
into
a
fantastic
brew
that
contends
with
the
top
barleywines
but
i
dont
recommend
even
trying
it
fresh
d
4
will
have
to
crack
another
open
in
a
year
or
so
and
see
if
the
bourbon
settles
down
at
all
right
now
this
is
huge
and
impressive
but
i
dont
like
it
as
much
as
the
regular
charlie
drinkability
have
one
more
bottle
of
this
i
loved
this
beer
and
im
curious
as
to
what
some
age
will
do
to
this
d
the
11
5
abv
is
evident
i
think
the
drinkability
is
relatively
good
with
all
factors
considered
but
others
at
the
same
tasting
thought
it
was
too
hot
this
beer
in
one
word
venerable
2010
vintage
this
brew
pours
a
mostly
clear
garnet
amber
topped
by
a
short
wisp
of
white
bubbles
the
nose
comprises
whiskey
oak
caramel
biting
citrus
and
a
touch
o
booze
the
taste
is
a
richer
version
of
the
smell
though
the
alcohol
really
busts
its
way
through
koolaid
manstyle
im
not
so
sure
id
say
oh
yeah
to
this
with
as
much
enthusiasm
as
that
glass
bastard
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
rather
thick
feel
overall
a
decent
bbbw
but
decidedly
too
boozy
right
now
perhaps
this
guy
will
be
calmer
with
some
years
on
him
but
hes
too
damn
hot
today
obscenely
drinkable
for
what
it
is
finished
it
faster
than
i
should
have
so
glad
i
have
3
more
bottles
i
imagine
this
aging
excellently
probably
the
best
barleywine
i
have
had
so
far
pours
a
clear
crimson
mahogany
color
with
a
moderate
light
beige
head
with
average
retention
and
lacing
for
the
style
and
abv
aroma
is
the
highlight
a
potent
complex
blend
of
bourbon
caramel
malt
mild
citrus
hops
oak
maple
berries
etc
with
surprisingly
little
booziness
unfortunately
the
flavor
isnt
quite
as
complex
and
balanced
at
the
nose
i
guess
this
could
use
some
more
age
on
it
flavor
starts
with
an
intense
vanilla
and
bourbon
booziness
before
the
base
of
a
more
english
style
barleywine
with
complex
caramel
malts
and
dark
fruity
esters
finish
is
exceptionally
boozy
and
drying
with
light
citric
hops
body
is
medium
thick
with
light
carbonation
and
overall
has
a
smooth
soft
texture
that
covers
the
palate
with
a
lingering
dry
bourbon
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
look
forward
to
aging
some
but
was
a
little
let
down
by
the
hype
on
this
as
i
enjoy
weyerbachers
insanity
almost
as
much
and
can
buy
that
off
the
shelf
drinks
great
skews
english
bw
to
me
but
that
could
be
age
im
resultsoriented
this
kicks
ass
pretty
palate
wrecking
would
not
be
able
to
knock
back
more
than
one
12
oz
and
still
be
able
to
taste
much
afterwards
overall
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
the
potency
in
flavor
and
abv
makes
it
limited
as
the
palate
and
brain
head
south
quickly
d
for
me
bourbon
aged
beers
are
either
hit
or
miss
and
this
one
was
without
a
doubt
a
hit
the
bourbon
was
pronounced
but
not
overwhelming
as
it
was
in
angles
share
this
was
a
delicious
interesting
fun
drink
if
you
havent
tried
it
you
should
this
beer
blew
me
away
by
far
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
and
also
one
of
the
best
beers
in
general
that
ive
had
as
well
ive
wanted
this
one
for
a
while
and
it
surely
did
not
disappoint
d
good
drinkability
but
definitely
a
sipper
glad
i
picked
this
beer
up
a
little
age
on
this
might
mellow
out
the
hops
and
make
this
really
special
i
could
definately
find
my
self
drinking
a
couple
of
these
in
a
night
so
enjoyable
all
the
way
through
dthis
one
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
for
me
something
just
was
missing
for
me
on
this
one
really
glad
i
got
to
try
it
though
this
one
has
a
very
strong
smell
was
able
to
catch
a
whiff
of
it
as
i
poured
it
a
couple
feet
below
my
nose
really
strong
bourbon
smell
and
the
taste
is
the
same
has
some
earthy
and
woody
tones
to
it
as
well
it
doesnt
really
have
that
hot
or
burning
feeling
as
the
alcohol
goes
down
which
was
slightly
surprising
but
thats
it
one
of
my
two
favorite
beers
from
one
of
my
two
favorite
wisconsin
breweries
this
is
a
perennial
favorite
and
a
blessing
to
those
fortunate
enough
to
live
here
if
youre
into
barleywines
and
havent
tried
this
you
should
really
seek
it
out
dont
take
my
word
for
it
continue
reading
below
ah
whats
left
to
say
central
waters
did
an
outstanding
job
with
this
one
i
have
to
surmise
this
will
do
extremely
well
with
various
years
on
it
for
some
folks
it
might
be
too
brash
at
this
point
but
i
certainly
enjoyed
it
as
is
highly
recommended
d
a
fine
sipper
that
could
use
a
bit
more
to
time
to
mellow
to
the
point
that
i
write
songs
to
pay
tribute
to
its
amazingness
in
the
meantime
ill
write
a
ba
review
to
record
the
moment
this
damn
fine
barleywine
hit
my
taste
buds
and
to
encourage
you
dear
reader
to
seek
it
out
glad
to
have
a
second
bottle
2010
edition
for
the
cellar
d
tastes
amazing
dont
taste
the
abv
at
all
goes
down
surprisingly
smooth
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
easily
ive
had
some
bad
barleywine
experiences
in
the
past
and
this
changed
my
mind
about
barleywine
completely
so
good
mfd
gives
off
a
slight
heat
that
coats
the
mouth
and
throat
with
a
smooth
finish
a
great
special
occasion
beer
no
wonder
this
is
in
such
high
demand
thought
about
trading
the
rest
of
my
stock
but
also
contemplating
saving
it
d
a
very
good
barleywine
no
doubts
about
that
so
glad
i
have
another
bottle
as
this
definitely
needs
to
sit
and
mellow
i
will
be
looking
forward
to
that
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
just
the
right
amount
of
present
alcohol
not
too
boozy
but
enough
to
let
you
know
it
is
bourbonbarrel
aged
drinkability
in
my
opinion
is
great
i
picked
this
up
tonight
thinking
i
would
just
slowly
enjoy
the
one
bottle
i
had
but
think
if
i
had
more
than
one
i
could
put
down
another
a
great
drinking
great
tasting
stand
out
in
its
class
beer
lived
up
to
any
hype
or
preconceived
notions
i
had
about
it
d
dont
get
any
alcohol
on
this
and
very
smooth
highly
drinkable
for
the
abv
overall
cant
believe
this
a
top
100
not
a
great
beer
has
potential
down
the
line
maybe
this
is
unbalanced
and
totally
too
woody
d
any
time
any
place
ill
drink
this
i
traded
away
way
too
much
but
i
hope
everyone
is
enjoying
it
god
knows
i
did
definitely
belongs
in
the
top
100
its
in
my
top
10
easily
yum
super
delic
call
your
sconsin
bas
and
get
yourself
some
d
even
at
11
5
plus
barrel
aging
there
really
isnt
too
much
alcohol
to
this
beer
one
of
the
best
barrel
aged
barleywines
ive
had
drinkability
is
quite
good
this
is
a
tasy
powerhouse
of
a
barley
wine
it
has
a
few
flaws
but
they
were
easy
to
overlook
when
i
take
a
sip
dthis
is
quite
tasty
and
has
a
great
nose
a
little
heat
in
the
back
but
nothing
that
crushes
the
beer
at
all
great
oak
presence
a
little
more
bourbon
in
the
flavor
but
still
very
nice
deep
garnet
with
lovely
clarity
in
the
light
offwhite
head
that
lasted
throughout
most
of
the
experience
bourbon
wafts
through
the
air
as
its
being
poured
oh
the
luxury
oak
rum
vanilla
hint
of
toasted
nuts
and
figs
fill
my
nares
and
makes
my
mouth
water
delicious
caramel
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
cocoa
makes
for
an
immediate
loving
of
bourbon
aged
barleywines
followed
by
toffee
black
currants
and
a
touch
of
berry
nicely
full
bodied
and
smooth
carbonation
out
of
this
world
d
this
is
one
of
the
nicest
examples
of
a
bourbon
barrel
treatment
ive
come
across
d
a
great
barleywine
with
a
great
future
ahead
of
it
tastes
great
now
but
age
will
continue
to
work
wonders
on
this
guy
rather
fruit
driven
but
goes
well
with
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
reminds
me
almost
of
a
port
wine
great
stuff
seek
this
out
and
buy
a
case
to
set
aside
and
drink
over
the
next
4
years
at
least
carbonation
level
is
low
but
appropriate
the
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
due
to
the
heat
for
me
cwbbw
is
difficult
to
figure
last
summer
we
had
a
two
year
old
bottle
that
had
aged
horribly
not
sure
if
there
is
a
bottle
to
bottle
variance
but
this
beer
could
use
some
aging
but
for
how
long
before
a
decline
is
unknown
for
11
50abv
this
is
very
drinkable
if
i
had
a
four
pack
of
this
id
probably
be
passed
out
by
now
but
id
have
a
great
time
getting
to
that
point
this
stuff
is
tasty
drinkability
is
definitely
impacted
by
the
sharpness
of
the
alcohol
in
the
taste
but
not
necessarily
any
more
than
in
other
beers
of
this
style
overall
a
tasty
and
somewhat
unexpected
beer
that
im
glad
to
have
enjoyed
i
received
a
dingle
bottle
of
this
as
an
extra
from
kbutler1
many
many
thanks
for
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
which
was
on
my
wants
list
by
the
way
it
pours
a
reddish
orange
color
with
about
one
finger
of
white
heading
from
the
nose
there
is
big
bourbon
and
some
maple
syrup
more
of
the
same
from
the
taste
except
the
hops
come
through
to
add
a
bitter
element
to
the
experience
there
is
also
a
nice
caramel
sweetness
that
accompanies
everything
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
pretty
boozy
but
does
not
get
in
the
way
of
drinkability
too
much
if
you
want
a
clear
picture
of
this
beer
taste
wise
it
is
very
similar
to
the
lost
abbey
angels
share
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
just
a
bit
hotter
and
more
bitter
with
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
it
might
even
pan
out
to
be
a
better
beer
centrsl
waters
made
a
great
barleywine
here
cheers
pours
a
thick
syrupy
dark
golden
amber
with
a
small
rising
off
white
head
smell
is
bourbon
and
oak
dried
dark
fruits
alcohol
i
think
the
barrel
really
takes
the
smell
over
taste
is
a
wonderful
intermingling
between
the
natural
flavors
of
the
beer
and
the
flavors
imparted
by
the
barrel
charred
oak
bourbon
sweet
caramel
malt
cherries
caramelized
brown
sugar
then
dried
dark
fruits
and
a
hoppy
bitterness
the
finish
is
sticky
warming
a
slight
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
soft
thats
the
only
thing
i
can
think
to
call
it
sticky
warming
and
comforting
an
adjective
that
i
think
should
be
more
widely
used
when
describing
beers
like
this
drinkable
enough
youre
not
really
supposed
to
want
another
id
love
sit
back
and
relax
with
this
after
a
great
meal
then
slip
into
a
buzzed
food
coma
and
sleep
like
a
baby
d
moderately
high
rivals
any
other
balaged
barleywine
ive
had
impressive
stuff
if
you
have
access
to
this
stuff
consider
yourself
lucky
aromas
of
rich
caramels
and
moderate
barrel
impact
the
central
waters
barrel
aged
beers
are
so
distinct
in
their
barrel
character
not
sure
what
kind
of
barrels
they
use
though
butterscotch
and
this
charredtoasted
wood
character
that
is
so
distinct
in
the
taste
some
sweeter
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
combine
with
the
robustness
of
the
barrel
notes
the
base
beer
is
not
as
complex
as
i
remembered
from
the
2009
vintage
still
boasts
some
darker
fruity
notes
and
toasted
nuts
for
added
depth
upper
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
felt
a
little
heavy
at
times
alcohol
becomes
surprisingly
evident
as
this
got
closer
to
room
temp
still
this
was
not
too
hot
but
rather
warming
making
you
constantly
aware
of
the
abv
this
is
a
pretty
good
ba
barlweywine
though
not
quite
as
magical
as
when
i
first
had
the
2009
vintage
a
nice
sipper
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
ages
overall
a
solid
effort
im
impressed
with
the
first
central
waters
brew
ive
had
wellbalanced
and
the
barrelaging
hits
all
of
the
right
notes
for
me
without
being
overwhelming
it
doesnt
make
the
top
tier
for
me
but
is
a
very
worthy
beer
d
overall
a
great
barleywine
has
a
great
bourbon
and
sweet
smell
and
taste
some
great
oak
as
well
would
love
to
have
again
i
recommend
this
ish
d
way
too
drinkable
dangerous
d
12oz
was
enough
for
one
sitting
but
it
takes
some
true
willpower
to
keep
the
other
3
bottles
i
have
in
the
ghetto
cellar
hopefully
ill
be
able
to
keep
at
least
one
bottle
to
compare
with
a
fresh
one
next
year
i
cannot
believe
how
good
this
is
for
the
price
i
wish
i
bought
more
pours
the
color
of
a
rusty
copper
penny
with
a
good
three
fingers
of
light
beige
foam
aromas
of
bourbon
oak
vanilla
and
cinnamon
flavors
of
bourbon
dark
caramel
dark
fruits
and
vanilla
a
very
nicely
put
together
beer
i
love
the
way
barley
wines
are
helped
with
the
addition
of
the
bourbon
barrels
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
d
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
find
at
my
local
store
sadly
i
hope
it
doesnt
take
this
long
to
get
some
more
of
it
i
think
this
beer
was
well
worth
the
wait
and
hope
to
be
able
to
get
more
of
it
a
very
well
made
beer
i
can
see
why
it
gets
the
scores
it
does
its
a
sipper
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
finishes
dry
lots
of
sweetness
up
front
but
its
not
cloying
at
all
the
liquor
and
alcohol
flavors
are
bright
and
pretty
forward
in
the
midpalate
i
imagine
some
age
on
this
would
really
help
this
beer
out
a
lot
there
is
no
aftertaste
and
connectivity
is
pretty
good
i
believe
this
will
age
well
the
malt
is
there
and
some
really
interesting
things
can
develop
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
d
this
is
one
of
the
most
delicious
barleywines
i
have
experienced
the
bourbon
really
works
well
with
the
style
medium
to
full
bodied
sweet
and
creamy
not
as
smooth
as
kosmyk
charlie
due
to
the
bourbon
but
still
very
nice
i
have
several
more
bottles
and
cant
wait
to
see
how
they
age
drinkability
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
barley
wine
but
this
one
was
quite
good
i
couldnt
handle
more
then
one
of
these
in
a
session
but
it
was
quite
drinkable
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
i
am
definitely
going
to
pick
up
some
more
of
this
for
the
cellar
for
sure
a
sipper
at
11
5
but
very
good
indeed
cant
wait
for
it
to
have
some
age
on
it
and
try
some
again
at
a
later
date
side
note
i
had
a
sample
of
this
at
the
beer
store
and
it
was
served
quite
cold
when
i
drank
this
bottle
it
was
served
at
cellaring
temp
and
i
enjoyed
it
much
more
i
would
recommend
letting
it
sit
out
of
your
refrigerator
for
a
while
before
drinking
d
i
am
absolutely
pumped
that
i
managed
to
snag
8
bottles
of
these
will
drink
one
or
two
more
this
year
with
the
rest
to
age
a
range
of
years
i
really
cant
imagine
a
much
better
american
barleywine
kudos
to
central
waters
thanks
cheezdawg
d
brilliant
i
weep
that
i
cant
walk
a
quarter
mile
and
pick
up
a
four
pack
of
this
anymore
truly
madison
wi
was
forged
by
the
gods
themselves
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
and
even
more
so
when
i
discovered
the
low
price
this
beer
is
a
steal
and
well
worth
a
shot
d
half
of
the
bottle
was
enough
for
me
right
now
i
have
a
couple
of
bottles
left
to
cellar
and
will
see
how
they
improve
as
they
get
a
chance
to
age
this
beer
is
very
fresh
and
ready
to
drink
now
it
will
mellow
out
and
change
with
age
but
it
is
fantastic
as
is
and
if
youre
patient
it
will
also
be
fantastic
down
the
road
had
a
2009
vintage
about
a
month
ago
and
it
had
calmed
down
a
bit
but
was
still
quite
boozy
and
nice
the
2010
picks
up
right
where
the
2009
left
off
great
beer
from
central
waters
gonna
drink
one
of
these
every
few
months
for
the
next
2
years
or
so
very
drinkable
for
the
style
i
want
to
get
a
lot
of
this
beer
and
keep
it
forever
overall
this
is
a
solid
bwine
a
little
hot
right
now
but
i
can
see
this
getting
extremely
tasty
with
time
i
am
glad
we
have
cw
so
close
to
us
this
is
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
tried
very
drinkable
well
done
taste
is
as
good
as
any
barley
wine
i
have
ever
tried
very
malty
with
not
much
hops
but
nicely
balanced
some
type
of
hops
that
remind
me
of
the
belgian
stylequestion
mark
some
sweetness
in
the
background
alcohol
is
warming
i
think
i
will
leave
some
of
these
a
while
and
maybe
that
finish
will
smooth
out
just
a
little
strong
on
the
chemical
taste
at
the
end
overall
i
would
like
to
put
some
age
on
it
i
think
it
would
improve
greatly
i
usually
dont
cellar
beers
which
are
not
bottleconditioned
so
i
probably
wont
keep
this
beer
long
enough
for
its
hops
to
mellow
which
is
a
bit
of
a
shame
pours
a
murky
reddishbrown
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
bourbon
caramel
brown
sugar
and
chocolate
the
flavor
is
chocolate
oak
bourbon
brown
sugar
alcohol
and
molasses
low
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
an
excellent
barleywine
that
is
enhanced
by
the
bourbonbarrel
aging
a
few
people
i
trust
have
told
me
that
this
beer
is
the
real
deal
including
overlord
and
mikedashg
thanks
mike
for
this
bottle
they
were
right
deliciously
complex
rich
balanced
elegant
and
flat
out
tasty
d
exceptional
goes
down
nicely
and
very
well
balanced
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
which
cuts
down
on
the
drinkability
but
this
one
is
meant
to
be
cherished
i
would
have
to
say
that
one
is
all
you
really
need
in
a
sitting
this
would
be
great
for
after
dinner
or
right
before
bed
central
waters
again
shows
why
it
is
an
up
and
coming
brewery
d
this
style
of
beer
is
meant
for
slow
sipping
one
and
done
for
me
i
am
not
a
big
barleywine
guy
but
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
one
that
i
will
enjoy
drinking
from
time
to
time
cw
delivers
again
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
for
the
style
very
mild
carbonation
with
a
rich
creamy
texture
the
flavors
of
this
beer
combined
so
nicely
nothing
really
overwhelming
the
other
components
unlike
some
other
barrel
aged
beers
that
basically
taste
like
carbonated
makers
mark
cws
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
is
well
balanced
and
delicious
i
have
high
expectations
for
this
beer
with
some
age
on
it
d
so
smooth
with
a
complexity
that
keeps
it
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
throughout
i
look
forward
to
more
of
the
same
from
central
waters
fantastic
overall
a
fantastic
elixir
that
joins
the
pantheon
of
great
barleywines
that
includes

thanks
todd
d
this
an
exceptional
beer
and
probably
the
best
barleywine
i
have
gotten
my
hands
on
to
date
the
smoothness
is
undeniable
and
really
separates
this
beer
from
other
barleywines
i
have
had
after
about
six
months
in
the
cellar
this
beer
is
great
so
i
am
curious
to
find
out
what
a
fresh
version
of
this
beer
would
taste
like
along
with
one
that
has
seen
some
extended
cellar
time
unfortunately
this
was
my
only
2009
bottle
so
i
will
have
to
hope
some
2010
versions
are
available
for
my
indulgence
amazing
beer
overall
i
must
say
that
this
beer
is
a
most
likely
a
shell
of
its
future
self
right
now
sit
on
this
for
at
least
612
months
if
you
want
to
experience
the
full
complexity
of
this
barleywine
that
being
said
it
is
still
very
tasty
even
in
this
young
state
not
quite
as
good
as
wooden
hell
but
a
damn
fine
bourbon
barreled
american
barley
wine
thats
worth
picking
up
good
job
central
waters
pours
a
dark
brown
with
some
crimson
highlights
not
quite
hazy
and
not
quite
opaque
but
definitely
not
at
all
translucent
the
smell
is
of
bourbon
molasses
brown
sugar
and
caramel
the
taste
is
equally
impressive
with
an
absolutely
gorgeous
bourbon
character
and
flavor
without
adding
too
much
alcohol
heat
also
picked
up
a
little
bit
of
oak
moderate
to
full
body
with
the
perfect
level
of
carbonation
for
the
style
and
just
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
heat
this
one
was
absolutely
fantastic
and
was
perhaps
the
best
bourbon
barleywine
that
ive
had
to
date
rivaled
only
by
kuhnhenns
version
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
small
amount
of
co2
leading
to
a
smooth
finish
central
waters
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
2008
is
damn
good
beer
that
tastes
like
its
at
the
peak
of
its
considerable
power
right
about
now
even
if
there
are
no
more
bottles
in
my
cellar
i
plan
to
stock
up
on
this
amazing
elixir
during
the
next
trip
up
to
madtown
overall
really
impressive
in
the
top
5
bourbon
barrel
bws
ive
had
i
think
drinkability
is
pretty
high
this
one
really
kicks
ass
overall
phenomenal
bbbw
up
there
with
perfect
storm
a
damn
fine
beer
this
is
an
extremely
complex
brew
and
it
was
suprising
to
me
at
how
good
it
was
i
wasnt
expecting
this
monster
of
a
beer
but
i
guess
i
should
have
despite
the
largeness
i
find
it
pretty
drinkable
though
it
is
a
slow
sipper
an
amazing
brew
d
im
very
partial
to
this
beerit
was
one
of
my
introductions
to
craft
beer
through
a
friend
which
i
didnt
feel
comfortable
reviewing
at
the
time
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
again
and
get
a
review
out
of
it
for
quite
a
while
now
to
see
if
it
was
really
as
good
as
i
had
remembered
as
opposed
to
good
in
comparison
to
well
pretty
terrible
beer
central
waters
did
not
fail
me
on
this
onei
can
now
say
that
i
absolutely
love
it
its
one
to
sip
but
for
the
style
and
what
id
guess
the
abv
to
be
its
incredibly
refreshing
and
drinkable
i
enjoyed
this
one
over
a
couple
hours
but
only
through
the
sheer
willpower
of
wanting
to
get
a
good
review
out
of
it
and
the
selfishness
of
wanting
to
save
it
for
as
long
as
possible
i
often
wish
that
we
could
easily
get
central
waters
stuff
in
virginia
but
really
really
wish
we
could
get
this
one
specificallyi
would
definitely
love
to
have
this
one
over
and
over
again
d
awesome
looking
and
smelling
beer
just
have
problems
with
the
hotness
and
rather
spicy
leather
alcohol
finish
i
look
forward
to
purchased
some
more
of
these
and
letting
them
get
a
little
age
on
them
d
while
this
beer
went
down
easy
i
wouldnt
call
it
sessionable
to
high
of
alcohol
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
one
to
share
with
those
you
like
overall
really
enjoyed
this
beer
definitely
would
not
mind
getting
another
one
of
these
tasty
d
the
strong
alcohol
presence
makes
this
a
slow
sipping
one
and
done
type
of
beer
id
like
to
revisit
this
vintage
again
in
the
future
but
not
for
a
while
overall
very
interesting
and
quite
nice
an
excellent
barleywine
worth
picking
up
if
you
get
the
chance
pours
a
dark
brown
with
minimal
head
what
head
that
did
form
disappeared
in
a
few
seconds
very
little
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
very
complex
i
detect
bourbon
vanilla
coconut
and
some
dark
fruit
alcohol
is
noticed
a
nice
flavor
as
well
surprisingly
the
bourbon
is
not
the
prominent
flavor
it
is
vanilla
with
dark
fruit
mostly
until
the
bourbon
comes
into
focus
the
finish
is
very
warm
with
alcohol
but
not
harsh
unfortunately
there
is
not
much
flavor
that
actually
comes
from
the
base
beer
it
is
all
barrel
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
that
lends
a
nice
texture
a
good
example
not
great
i
wonder
how
an
older
example
would
taste
d
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
very
best
bbbws
being
produced
right
now
hands
down
smooth
complex
and
best
of
all
not
overly
hot
ragged
or
skull
crushingly
strong
sure
its
meant
to
be
sipped
but
those
sips
were
coming
pretty
quickly
for
me
this
is
pretty
damn
nice
right
now
i
dont
know
if
any
more
age
is
gonna
help
it
though
i
think
with
another
year
the
malts
may
become
a
bit
cloying
and
leave
the
hops
behind
and
not
be
as
balanced

thick

the
huge

bill
drying
finish
from
alcohol
heat
and
reasonably
high
hopping
an
interesting
brew
pours
deep
copper
with
light
tan
head
nice
aroma
with
tasty
wood
and
bourbon
notes
that
dont
really
over
shadow
the
fruity
esters
and
faint
maltiness
the
alcohol
heat
does
build
up
and
singe
the
nose
a
bit
the
taste
starts
with
mildly
sweet
maltiness
and
roasty
malts
that
then
becomes
wood
and
barrel
like
flavors
before
a
formidable
vanilla
flavor
takes
hold
theres
also
dark
fruity
esters
of
grapes
cherries
and
prunes
before
the
alcohol
hotness
builds
to
a
distracting
level
it
could
use
more
age
darn
tasty
now
though
im
thrilled
with
the
way
the
bourbon
came
through
on
this
beer
for
being
so
young
almost
too
young
perhaps
i
have
another
that
ill
age
for
a
year
to
compare
against
it
does
remind
me
of
some
of
the
young
2008
gi
bcs
i
had
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
had
a
lasting
cap
but
no
lacing
aroma
is
lightly
oxidized
plenty
of
sticky
sweet
malt
a
bit
of
hoppiness
rounded
out
by
a
touch
of
oak
taste
is
mucho
oak
vailla
caramel
and
dark
fruits
galore
i
can
definitely
pick
out
some
raisins
and
overripe
fruits
in
this
one
a
nice
kick
of
piney
hops
loads
of
caramel
very
sweet
and
becomes
even
more
so
as
it
starts
to
warm
bourbon
wasnt
very
present
but
the
musty
wet
oak
barrel
was
carbonation
is
nearly
absent
smooth
sippable
delicious
this
one
tastes
pretty
good
but
theres
just
a
touch
of
oxidation
in
the
nose
and
in
the
flavor
not
sure
if
the
bottle
was
starting
to
go
bad
but
it
had
just
a
hint
of
that
oxidized
cardboard
taste
still
pretty
darn
good
and
i
hope
the
other
bottle
i
picked
will
age
gracefully
overall
a
favorite
beer
no
doubt
i
love
this
thing
time
and
time
again
drinkability
an
unbelievable
beer
a
remarkable
array
and
assortment
of
flavors
in
near
perfect
balance
provides
for
a
true
treat
whether
alone
or
with
dessert
no
burn
at
all
and
well
since
i
dont
know
what
the
abv
is
i
cant
really
knock
any
points
off
for
drinkability
there
right
im
going
to
guess
between
9
5
and
10
5
though
at
this
level
my
margin
of
error
gets
a
little
screwy
regardless
this
is
a
wellcrafted
beer
with
a
good
albeit
mild
nose
a
fantastic
mouthfeel
and
flavor
profile
exceptional
drinkability
for
the
style
and
one
i
would
insist
anyone
who
sees
buys
up
instantly
and
then
mail
it
to
me
d
going
to
be
slow
drinking
this
thing
some
heat
at
first
thats
soon
eclipsed
by
a
gargantuan
battle
cruiser
of
bourbon
and
malt
flavors
if
you
like
those
two
things
you
cant
go
wrong
sweet
vanilla
aftertaste
plenty
of
rich
malt
and
some
residual
hop
bitterness
drying
finish
somewhat
concealed
in
the
booze
department
rich
and
syrupy
feel
thankfully
dry
on
the
end
like
y2k
and
not
a
sickly
sweet
aftertaste
like
so
many
barleywines
the
barrel
is
integrated
here
and
its
not
too
hot
but
you
know
deep
down
this
is
a
booze
bomb
plenty
of
warmth
but
not
in
the
taste
very
well
done
overall
one
to
look
forward
to
every
year

d
would
love
to
drink
these

a
couple
of
reasons

not
but
this
one
is
worth
having
dabout
as
good
as
a
bba
barleywine
can
get
the
folks
at
cw
sure
know
how
to
barrel
aged
beers
i
am
surprised
they
remain
under
the
radar
but
in
a
way
i
am
glad
they
do
a
well
kept
wisconsin
secret
keep
up
the
great
work
cw
mouthfeel
is
medium
heavy

and
smooth
with

i
wish
this
were
more
widely
available
central

only
recently
made
it
to
hudson
and
at
this
point
i
think
id
be
missing
out
if
they
hadnt
highly
recommended
if
this
was
a
onetime
brewery
only
release
of
about
1000
bottles
in
a
750
ml
bottle
the
hype
would
be
insane
central
waters
has
a
huge
hit
with
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
this
is
my
first
beer
from
them
and
im
extremely
impressed
the
flavor
is
simply
massive
and
deep
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
adds
an
excellent
flavor
here
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
but
damn
this
is
good
stuff
ive
been
sitting
on
a
few
bottles
from
central
waters
and
im
now
extremely
excited
to
try
them
out
alex
i
shouldve
hit
you
up
for
more
than
one
bottle
of
this
stuff
if
youre
reading
this
youre
wasting
time
that
you
should
be
spending
tracking
down
central
waters
beer
go
find
it
good
mouthfeel
with
carbonation
being
on
the
lower
side
very
complex
all
the
way
around
an
outstanding
beer
drinkability
the
beer
is
honestly
a
bit
sweet
but
not
bad
for
it
being
as
young
as
it
is
im
not
100
sure
the
sweetness
will
ever
be
toned
down
even
after
some
age
but
everything
should
even
out
a
bit
definitely
will
only
get
better
thanks
very
much
steve
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
yet
to
have
seek
this
out
i
will
be
enjoying
this
again
in
the
future
you
cant
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
this
velvety
barleywine
is
so
unique
and
delicious
central
waters
needs
more
reach
as
this
beer
should
be
enjoyed

as
many

well
not
much
beer
to
be
found
here
finish
is
dry
and
slightly
bitter
definitely
too
heavy
on
the
barrel
here
but
it
still
tastes
good
d
despite
the
mystery
abv
on
this
beer
its
very
nice
to
drink
on
im
not
going
to
be
pounding
these
but
i
would
definitely
drink
this
all
night
long
this
is
a
nice
beer
with
great
drinkability
very
tasty
this
is
much
more
enjoyable
than
i
was
expecting
the
coconut
notes
from
the
barrel
are
really
nice
and
it
really
works
with
the
thick
sweet
rich
base
beer
without
the
barrel
influence
the
base
beer
might
note
even
be
all
that
good
or
balanced
the
aroma
is
not
as
complex
as
the
flavor
but
it
is
quite
distinct
with
its
inviting
coconut
note
this
is
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
am
quite
glad
to
have
tried
d
not
the
most
drinkable
bw
ive
ever
had
but
overall
its
such
a
tasty
beer
2010
revisted
on
122310
doesnt
have
the
sweetness
of
2009
but
after
a
year
the
alcohol
burn
has
faded
and
its
woody
and
dry
with
an
appropriate
bite
early
2010
had
solvents
ruining
things
excited
for
the
2011
batch
taste
begins

passes
through

close
and
then
alcohol
comes
on
full
bore
at
the
end
numb
lips
warming
down
the
gullet
its
all
there
mouthfeel
is
way
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
in
the
i
want
another
sometime
sense
not
the
i
want
another
bottle
or
three
right
now
sense
at
least
not
if
you
have
any
sense
with
abv
such
as
it
is
d
highly
drinkable
for
the
flavor
but
less
so
for
the
alcohol
kick
not
as
good
as
abacus
or
angels
share
when
carbonated
but
still
pretty
terrific
overall
fantastic
barleywine
cant
think
of
any
better
ive
had
would
be
much
more
drinkable
if
the
sweetness
was
down
a
notch
one
bottle
is
perfect
pick
this
one
up
if
you
can
find
it
im
sure
it
will
soon
be
on
the
top
10
of
the
style
this
is
a
good
beer
ive
been
a
fan
of
the
central
waters
brand
and
i
have
to
say
they
havent
let
me
down
here
either
im
thinking
they
may
never
let
me
down
i
appreciate
that
thanks
cw
find
this
drink
this
great
beer
d
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
been
so
sad
to
see
an
empty
glass
this
was
just
spectacular
i
need
more
from
central
waters
overall
this
does
not
taste
much
like
a
barley
wine
to
me
the
bourbon
and
oak
character
kind
of
take
over
letting
the
original
beer
be
a
subtle
after
thought
with
that
said
this
is
still
a
great
beer
great
flavor
aroma
and
mouth
feel
d
this
is
an
excellent
bourbon
barleywine
great
to
sip
on
anytime
i
will
certainly
seek
this
out
again
in
the
future
everything
about
it
is
complex
great
example
of
a
barrel
aged
barley
wine
phenomenal
beer
especially
for
the
price
after
trying
one
on
tap
at
the
release
i
bought
a
case
i
hope
i
have
enough
update
received
the
2009
vintage
in
a
trade
with
eyncognito
and
bumped
the
drinkability
up
to
4
5
the
body
is
closer
to
big
than
moderate
a
big
plus
is
that
the
beer
is
so
easy
to
drink
overall
a
great
barleywine
thanks
to
flyingbison
for
the
trade

taste
mouthfeel
rich
sweet
full
on
the
palate
moderate
bitterness
keeps
things
balanced
but
this
is
a
definite
slow
sipper
bourbon
flavors
are
very
much
present
but
in
balance
with
the
base
beer
slight
sherrylike
oxidation
has
begun
to
set
in
which
adds
a
nice
layer
of
complexity
this
one
should
age
nicely
for
years
to
come
the
finish
is
bittersweet
with
bitter
eventually
taking
the
edge
very
solid
stuff
as
someone
who
isnt
a
big
barleywine
fan
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
hazy
amber
brownish
color
with
a
beige
head
that
has
decent
retention
and
lacing
aroma
just
amazes
me
i
absolutely
love
their
bourbon
beers
havent
had
anything
else
that
compares
sweet
caramel
bourbon
and
vanilla
just
such
an
amazing
aroma
taste
echoes
the
aroma
whatever
they
do
the
flavors
just
hit
me
perfectly
thicker
than
medium
body
somewhat
light
carbonation
but
goes
down
very
smooth
another
excellent
barrel
aged
beer
from
central
waters
keep
it
up
other
than
the
overthetop
wood
which
really
ruins
this
beer
for
me
i
get
english
flavors
only
without
the
sweetness
strange
to
say
the
least
and
sure
i
get
bitterness
but
i
associate
that
with
tannins
from
the
wood
and
not
with
hops
a
most
unpleasant
experience
given
another
10
years
in
the
bottle
i
might
think
about
actually
drinking
one
as
in
when
it
has
mellowed
down
to
something
only
slightly
more
extreme
than
a
normal
barleywine
but
as
it
is
neither
i
nor
the
wife
even
wants
to
smell
it
again
certainly
worth
trying
but
this
falls
a
little
short
for
me
i
love
my
wife
my
guitars
my
car
and
my
own
homebrew
but
this
beer
is
my
favorite
thing
it
is
very
limited
and
hard
to
get
aholf
of
basically
because
i
buy
it
all
up
whenever
i
see
it
it
takes
me
about
an
hour
or
two
to
finish
a
bottle
i
think
they
use
the
same
barrels
as
thier
cherry
stout
so
expect
slight
cherry
flavors
to
come
through
when
it
is
warm
drink
at
room
temp
wash
over
your
tongue
this
beer
changed
my
freakin
life
drinkability
is
great
excellent
balance
the
barrel
character
is
present
but
not
overpowering
and
works
very
well
this
is
my
second
favourite
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
behind
kuhnhenns
really
great
stuff
glad
i
still
have
another
in
the
cellar
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
pumpkin
colour
light
bit
of
brown
thin
off
white

drops
immediately
to

need
to
get
some
more
of
these
thanks
russ
d
too
much
of
a
good
thing
for
long
term
top
knotch
i
think
i
am
starting
to
prefer
bourbon
aged
strong
ales
over
bourbon
aged
stouts
at
least
until
my
next
ba
stout
the
residual
sugars
in
this
barleywine
really
pick
up
the
complexities
created
by
the
barrels
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
wonderful
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
1
12
in
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
cap
on
the
brew
and
lacing
sticky
as
glue
the
smell
is
a
wonderful
bouquet
of
plum
raisin
grapes
and
some
hints
of
caramel
and
floral
hops
this
has
a
lot
going
on
and
in
my
first
sip
it
was
not
jumbled
it
was
subtly
smooth
the
taste
is
sharp
with
fruits
that
meld
into
a
delightful
flavor
the
brew
is
a
medium
body
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
let
the
taste
explode
in
your
mouth
great
work
a
must
have
brew
d
i
wish
i
had
more
than
one
d
this
beer
is
all
about
the
big
caramel
sweet
malt
with
some
nice
support
from
the
pine
hops
and
a
very
faint
hint
of
barrel
only
after
each
sip
this
beer
does
not
have
much
depth
of
flavor
but
the
flavors
it
does
have
are
big
and
robust
i
kind
of
miss
the
alcohol
kick
that
cleans
out
the
sweetness
at
the
finish
but
it
still
goes
down
smooth

a
very
large

a
real
treat
from
a
small
fantastic
wisconsin
brewery
that
is
really
doing
everything
right
when
it
comes
to
these
barrell
aged
project
beers
this
is
a
wonderful
little
brewery
from
wisconsin
and
this
is
the
second
simply
spectacular
barrel
aged
beer
ive
had
from
central
waters
their
bourbonbarrel
aged
stout
being
the
other
i
owe
a
big
thanks
to
the
packers
fan
who
made
both
possible
thanks
nflmvp
this
was
one
serious
treat
i
would
recommend
this
beer
i
found
it
different
than
other
barleywines
and
really
goodtasting
i
bought
this
12oz
bottle
at
discount
liquor
in
milwaukee
d
an
awesome
sipper
great
barleywine
courtesy
of
derek
alias
the
y2k
barrelaged
the
bourbon
aroma
is
mellow
and
pleasing
the
ruby
colour
and
white
bubbly
head
beatiful
lace
rich
taste
the
bourbon
is
intrinsic
and
its
mellowed
somewhat
woodysweetish
balanced
above
average
mouthfeel
a
great
sipper
good
stuff
wonderful
taste
of
deep
stone
fruits
and
roasty
malt
deeply
satisfying
one
of
the
best
all
time
a
sipper
for
sure
overall
i
really
cannot
say
enough
good
things
about
this
one
one
of
the
best
barley
wines
i
have
ever
tasted
and
really
just
a
testament
to
how
good
something
can
get
with
barrel
aging
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
again
any
day
of
the
week
d
slightly
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
tastes
but
a
very
nice
sipper
with
great
bourbon
qualities
me
likes
me
my
bourbon
md
clean
for
a
barley
wine
nice
bourbon
finish
along
with
a
little
boozy
heat
i
am
glad
i
bought
2
of
these
one
for
now
one
to
cellar
hell
im
thinking
of
buying
a
really
good
oak
aged
sipping
bourbon
now
this
was
wonderful
pours
a
cloudy
deep
copper
with
a
dense
head
that
dissipated
quickly
to
a
ring
foam
leaving
sporadic
lacing
the
first
aroma
is
the
big
sweet
caramel
malt
smell
with
raisins
dates
and
subtle
earthy
hops
this
is
followed
by
a
big
bourbon
backbone
along
with
some
sweet
vanilla
beans
the
taste
actually
has
more
bourbon
than
the
smell
with
a
more
prominent
molasses
sweetness
the
caramel
malts
and
earthy
hops
are
still
there
as
well
but
the
bourbon
really
comes
out
in
the
taste
with
a
serious
alcohol
burn
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
very
creamy
the
is
a
very
good
bourbon
barleywine
but
the
heavy
bourbon
presence
means
that
getting
through
one
of
these
would
make
for
a
good
night
update
ive
had
quite
of
few
of
these
now
with
612
months
on
it
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
fantastic
cheers
thanks
goes
to
elitedigger
for
a
couple
bottles
of
this
in
a
recent
trade
drinkability
this
is
pretty
central
waters
ill
cheerfully
admit
that
pours
dark
orange
red
with
a
slight
116
inch
head
and
low
lacing
very
lightly
carbonated
strong
bourbon
malt
smell
bold
bourbonmalt
flavor
that
is
smooth
and
balanced
this
is
very
good
and
the
11
2
abv
is
certainly
in
your
face
the
malt
tastes
goes
very
well
with
the
bourbon
this
is
worth
buying
very
enjoyable
world
class
12
oz
from
dirty
louis
into
my
brooklyn
snifter
great
barleywine
all
around
im
not
sure
whether
i
like
this
or
the
regular
kosmyk
charlie
better
but
this
is
a
good
use
of
bourbon
barrel
aging
does
not
overwhelm
but
mellows
a
bit
and
adds
a
few
dimensions
to
the
flavor
to
be
honest
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
bourbonbarreled
barleywines
especially
hoppy
ones
like
this
as
i
often
find
the
barrel
aging
to
be
at
odds
with
the
hop
profile
and
the
result
ends
up
with
a
bunch
of
clashing
colors
this
achieves
glory
by
compartmentalizing
the
barleywine
and
bourbon
barrel
traits
up
until
the
very
end
and
when
they
finally
do
converge
its
absolutely
harmonious
its
the
best
example
of
the
style
specifically
booze
barreled
bwines
that
ive
come
across
and
i
cant
think
of
another
that
even
comes
close
this
is
a
brew
id
love
to
have
every
day
for
the
rest
of
my
life
great
barrel
aging
art
on
this
rich
and
creamy
middle
showing
off
caramel
and
toffee
ripe
dates
and
dried
figs
alcohol
brown
sugar
rum
soaked
raisin
thick
tight
vanilla
and
wood
with
a
jeffersons
reserve
bourbon
flavor
i
have
no
clue
what
bourbon
barrels
they
used
or
why
i
even
said
that
a
showing
of
residual
sugar
towards
the
late
middle
ends
in
earthy
hop
bitter
bliss
balancing
things
impressively
very
well
done
d
i
really
dont
think
more
than
one
per
sitting
is
doable
but
youll
enjoy
that
one
props
to
ba
nflmvp
for
this
beer
on
the
day
the
nfl
mvp
said
his
goodbye
drinkability
a
monster
d
pretty
solid
well
enjoyed
the
kosmik
might
be
better
but
its
still
solid
this
is
a
really
well
crafted
beer
the
bourbon
notes
really
made
it
great
highly
recommended
long
lasting
in
the
mouth
never
quitting
very
satisfying
flavor
like
an
orange
wedge
doused
in
cognac
so
good
an
excellent
nightcap
which
this
is
tonight
lovely
lovely
this
beer
took
a
lot
of
the
same
flavor
cues
from
the
nonbourbon
ale
this
adds
a
light
whiskey
element
near
the
end
the
aroma
is
pleasant
with
the
oak
and
vanilla
but
still
too
weak
the
drinkability
was
pretty
good
and
unlike
many
other
barleywines
worth
a
try
very
tasty
label
is
the
same
as
the
regular
kosmyk
charlies
y2k
catastrophe
ale
but
with
a
circle
shaped
green
sticker
on
the
right
side
of
the
label
that
states
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
only
available
at
the
brewery
ruby
brown
color
fairly
powerful
nose
mainly
dominated
by
the
bourbon
barrel
vanilla
bourbon
oak
coconut
palate
is
okay
could
be
more
textured
and
creamier
flavor
is
good
but
not
sublime
fairly
well
balanced
but
the
flavors
dont
come
together
very
well
ive
had
several
better
bourbon
barrel
aged
barley
wines
a
by
the
fire
sipper
or
put
it
in
a
flask
and
go
play
in
the
snow
beer
wow
huge
hit
from
the
guys
at
central
waters
too
bad
this
one
is
so
limited
it
sounds
like
we
may
see
this
one
again
next
winter
damn
i
sure
hope
so
a
huge
thanks
to
nflmvp
for
sending
this
rare
barleywine
my
way
as
soon
as
i
uncapped
the
bottle
my
nose
was
bombarded
with
tropical
fruit
aromas
it
was
then
that
i
knew
i
was
in
for
a
real
treat
poured
from
a
12oz
brown
bottle
into
my
snifter
glass
and
allowed
to
warm
up
for
30
minutes
served
at
55f
appears
a
slightly
cloudy
deep
amberred
color
with
barely
half
an
inch
of
tan
head
the
head
fades
rather
quickly
leaving
a
thin
ring
around
the
inside
of
the
glass
and
no
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
of
tropical
fruits
mainly
pineapple
as
well
as
toasted
coconut
vanilla
bourbon
caramel
malt
and
oak
the
bourbon
really
hits
you
upfront
once
you
take
a
sip
as
it
should
this
is
followed
by
notes
of
pineapple
more
bourbon
prunes
vanilla
and
a
nice
peppery
bite
across
the
tongue
great
malt
balance
the
alcohol
burn
starts
as
soon
as
you
take
a
sip
and
continues
into
the
dry
finish
although
it
is
always
kept
in
check
mouthfeel
is
a
notch
or
two
above
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
for
me
this
is
certainly
a
sipper
in
order
to
take
in
all
this
beer
has
to
give
you
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
rich
and
complex
barleywine
id
love
to
revisit
it
in
a
year
or
so
to
see
how
its
changed
if
you
have
the
chance
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
thanks
to
thefatkid13
for
the
bottle
thumbup
fn
furley
steve
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
drinkability
typical
for
a
barleywine
enjoyable
for
sipping
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
session
prosit
und
zum
wohl
mk
a
bit
strange
it
smells
so
much
maltier
than
it
tastes
or
does
it
taste
so
much
hoppier
than
it
smells
either
way
the
deliciousness
promised
by
my
nose
was
not
met
by
my
tongue
not
entirely
im
a
little
disappointed
o
this
is
a
great
beer
awesome
flavors
and
complexity
that
would
probably
fare
very
well
mingling
with
a
bourbon
barrel
this
is
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
ever
had
its
just
about
perfect

opaque

pretty
well
before
fading
into
a
medium

rich

low

i
think
i
aged
this
one
a
bit
too
long
or
maybe
not
long
enough
that
dirtlike
flavor
is
a
little
off
putting
o
i
wasnt
expecting
to
like
this
after
the
strong
hops
scent
raced
immediately
after
the
pint
was
opened
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
taste
didnt
love
it
but
would
have
it
again
o
the
two
years
of
age
have
done
this
amazingly
well
this
is
absolutely
insanely
drinkable
the
9
abv
is
hardly
noticeable
as
i
am
cruising
through
this
bomber
with
ease
this
is
one
of
the
best
barleywines
on
the
market
do
yourself
a
favor
and
set
this
one
aside
for
awhile
and
reap
the
benefits
o
another
good
brew
from
troegs
for
me
it
lacks
just
a
touch
of
complexity
but
makes
up
for
that
in
drinkability
dangerously
so
this
goes
down
easy
so
be
careful
at
over
9
overall
really
like
this
beer
this
is
from
the
2012
batch
and
has
aged
nicely
really
hoppy
when
fresh
but
ages
so
well
worth
a
try
for
sure
overall
pretty
solid
barleywine
that
i
have
enjoyed
a
lot
of
over
the
years
overall
maybe
a
little
passed
its
prime
but
really
smooth
and
rich
fantastic
balance
and
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
if
only
this
was
available
in
12oz
bottles
6packs
id
fill
up
my
cellar
with
it
overall
this
beast
is
still
just
a
touch
clumsy
for
me
and
its
alcohol
and
related
organics
not
knitted
tightly
enough
to
its
taste
elements
but
it
improves
like
wine
with
time
on
the
foundation
of
good
malts
and
astringent
tannins
as
it
should
im
tempted
to
get
a
growler
this
coming
season
and
hold
it
for
a
full
year
dark
in
the
cold
to
another
level
of
maturity
and
i
also
cant
wait
for
the
reminder
of
the
lively
birth
of
a
fresh
glass
in
a
couple
of
months
overall
a
great
example
of
the
sweeter
side
of
the
style
i
think
this
one
is
better
fresh
but
its
still
a
great
barleywine
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
as
it
ages
it
gains
the
englishstyle
characteristics
the
craftsmanship
is
always
there
with
troegs
i
heard
they
mightve
stopped
brewing
this
one
but
im
not
positive
so
id
grab
one
if
you
see
it
this
was
a
really
good
example
of
a
barleywine
and
aging
it
for
a
year
may
have
changed
some
of
its
characteristics
but
im
awfully
glad
i
did
it
cheers
o
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
the
strong
points
for
sure
no
real
weaknesses
very
smooth
and
drinkable
with
big
balanced
taste
very
nice
definitely
on
my
repeat
buy
list
o
sweet
barleywine
with
a
rich
flavor
exotic
aroma
would
be
great
by
the
fireside
and
a
pipe
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
would
keep
in
my
cellar
to
share
with
others
certainly
a
good
introduction
to
barleywines
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
will
seek
out
more
not
as
hoppy
as
other
american
barleywines
but
this
may
have
been
on
the
shelf
for
awhile
when
i
rescued
it
may
update
with
future
samplings
i
would
say
this
may
somewhat
of
a
bridge
between
the
english
and
american
style
oa
great
barleywine
for
the
price
enjoyable
sipper
overall
a
solid
barleywine
though
not
really
anything
too
special
good
not
great
or
in
a
must
try
category
i
prefer
my
barleywines
to
be
barrel
aged
and
this
one
definitely
isnt
but
its
still
quite
good
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
barelywine
this
one
fits
the
bill
nicely
o
4

this
beer
is
advertised
as
an
american
barleywine
but
to
be
honest
this
tastes
like
much
more
like
an
english
barleywine
with
mostly
malt
forward
and
little
hop
aromaflavors
nevertheless
this
is
an
excellent
beer
with
lots
of
complex
malt
characters
in
the
nose
and
mouth
that
are
very
pleasant
i
want
to
drink
this
beer
again
in
the
cold
winter
months
by
a
fire
which
is
where
it
will
totally
shine
ive
never
had
this
fresh
but
this
aged
bottle
tured
out
to
be
a
great
extra
sweet
smooth
caramel
goodness
o
i
was
really
excited
for
this
because
of
the
high
hop
content
which
i
thought
would
make
it
taste
like
bigfoot
i
would
say
that
it
makes
for
a
decent
backup
bw
but
if
it
only
comes
in
bombers
then
shoot
for
something
else

very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
american
barleywine
at
2
years
of
age
very
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
malt
flavors
with
moderate
hops
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
there
is
a
very
nice
amount
of
complexity
in
this
beer
that
makes
this
one
best
enjoyed
by
slowly
sipping
to
appreciate
it
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
in
this
beer
but
it
is
definitely
a
strong
beer
and
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
o
very
good
i
was
surprised
at
how
much
i
liked
this
one
it
comes
together
very
nicely
i
would
recommend
o
this
beer
is
rather
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
because
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
from
the
taste
nonetheless
its
a
nice
beer
to
sip
and
savor
given
its
complex
taste
a
fantastic
dessert
beer
and
great
for
a
dinnerending
cheese
plate
buy
one
to
have
fresh
and
one
to
age
a
steal
in
terms
of
the
bargain
domain
thank
you
troegs
drinks
easy
for
the
style
abv
but
not
blown
away
by
this
one
but
i
did
enjoy
it
as
a
nightcap
described
as
pushing
nugget
nectar
off
a
cliff
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
hoppier
still
great
in
its
own
right
but
definitely
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
think
the
wheat
slightly
overpowers
the
hops
but
not
in
a
bad
way
first
smell
wasnt
the
best
but
considerably
better
after
the
pour
very
drinkable
but
defjnitely
one
to
a
sitting
given
the
abv
interestingly
enough
according
to
the
web
a
mouflan
is
an
iranian
sheep
d
great
for
the
winter
as
the
spring
and
summer
approach
i
can
see
drinking
this
full
bodied
of
a
beer
but
another
fantastic
beer
from
troegs
overall
good
barleywine
not
great
one
year
of
cellar
time
may
not
be
enough
d
agree
with
others
close
to
american
barleywine
flavors
good
but
not
impressive
no
point
in
opening
this
without
cellar
time
how
long
medium
to
full
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
feels
a
bit
sticky
and
has
a
sweet
aftertaste
there
is
no
alcohol
burn
which
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
i
am
glad
i
held
onto
this
for
a
few
months
i
would
gladly
buy
this
again
if
i
get
another
opportunity
body
is
a
bit
heavy
so
you
wont
likely
be
swirling
more
than
2448
oz
down
at
a
sitting
incredibly
drinkable
and
delicious
i
came
in
without
expectations
and
i
left
wanting
more
flying
mouflan
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
and
the
age
mellowed
it
a
little
which
i
enjoyed
excellent
o
a
good
representation
of
the
style
although
the
time
that
the
bottle
sat
made
it
less
american
because
of
the
diminished
hops
d
pretty
close
to
your
standard
american
barleywine
flavorsdescriptors
good
but
similar
to
most
beers
in
this
style
guideline
nothing
too
impressive
this
had
some
time
on
it
and
still
had
some
heat
interested
to
know
how
long
until
that
flavor
fully
sizzles
out
this
is
a
winner
will
try
again
o
i
dont
usually
drink
barley
wines
as
they
arent
really
my
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
it
was
really
drinkable
for
the
amount
of
malt
in
the
taste
which
would
normally
turn
me
off
it
could
definitely
be
toned
down
and
have
the
deeper
flavors
come
out
with
some
age
but
an
enjoyable
experience
none
the
less
worth
a
try
if
you
like
barleywines
taste
is
exactly
as
thought
a
hoppy
malt
bomb
a
decent
citrus
hop
presence
hits
first
but
quickly
gets
pushed
aside
as
the
sweet
deep
caramel
malt
takes
over
the
carameltoffee
is
huge
still
finishes
slightly
dry
and
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
isnt
cloying
or
overly
sticky
soft
carbonation
lends
a
great
creaminess
and
body
to
this
beer
a
tasty
beer
although
one
id
recommend
splitting
as
its
too
overly
sweet
to
take
down
a
whole
bottle
myself
even
splitting
it
11
oz
was
more
than
enough
ive
had
this
at
various
stages
of
its
life
and
feel
its
definitely
best
fresh
as
the
sweetnessbitterness
are
the
best
ratio
then
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
and
recommend
trying
it
as
it
was
highly
drinkable
to
me
for
the
style
and
tasty
in
general
im
glad
i
let
this
age
as
it
was
a
lot
mellower
than
i
expected
and
a
very
fine
slow
sipper
indeed
id
like
to
get
a
few
more
bottles
to
try
it
fresh
and
age
one
for
a
longer
period
of
time
the
alcohol
kicks
in
as
i
took
the
last
few
sips
so
look
out
as
this
one
creeps
up
on
you
conclusion
i
intended
to
wait
till
sometime
next
year
to
open
this
bottle
received
in
a
trade
in
early
2010
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
tried
this
beer
and
seeing
as
it
never
makes
it
out
to
co
it
may
be
the
last
well
worth
the
wait
and
i
am
glad
i
didnt
drink
it
fresh
o
goes
down
easy
pretty
tasty
somewhat
filling
big
kick
nice
representation
of
style
easy
drinking
with
food
but
also
good
with
conversation
o
very
good
american
barleywine
this
isnt
a
wow
beer
but
a
very
good
solid
one
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
from
what
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
looking
forward
to
trying
this
again
o
i
much
prefer
a
englsih
barely
wine
over
american
but
i
bought
these
with
the
intent
to
age
for
awhile
this
has
been
laid
done
for
about
8
months
and
has
aged
finely
im
looking
toward
to
the
next
4
for
many
years
great
barely
wine
from
a
somewhat
local
brewery
o
this
is
pretty
nice
very
drinkable
and
offers
a
nice
balance
between
some
hop
notes
and
the
maltesters
the
bottle
pours
a
deep
murky
maroon
that
is
nearly
candied
dark
brown
the
head
is
surprisingly
large
and
frothy
with
a
maplesyrupmixedintowhippedcream
coloring
to
it
lacing
from
the
beer
is
sticky
and
weblike
over
the
glass
leaving
fat
stalactites
of
foam
on
my
snifters
walls
the
beer
smells
bitter
and
sweet
but
surprisingly
underwhelming
with
notes
of
prickly
alcohol
and
cloyingly
sweet
candied
sugars
and
caramel
assaulting
the
nose
brown
sugar
is
also
present
and
enticing
evening
out
some
of
the
harsher
notes
of
the
smell
though
it
really
is
a
light
smell
overall
faint
hints
of
pine
and
citrus
hops
can
be
found
though
this
is
a
2011
bottle
of
flying
mouflan
so
they
have
obviously
died
down
a
little
slight
bready
notes
can
also
be
sensed
in
the
edges
of
the
smell
falling
away
into
the
sweet
alcohol
smell
as
it
warms
up
the
phenol
smells
grow
stronger
the
beer
tastes
big
and
pleasant
the
flavor
profile
is
surprisingly
simple
but
actually
quite
tasty
the
beer
opens
as
caramelly
bready
before
opening
into
sweet
candied
sugars
and
brown
sugar
before
it
transitions
into
a
mixture
of
slight
citrus
and
the
honeysweet
malts
eventually
the
beer
makes
a
slow
march
to
harsh
aspirin
bitters
that
pepper
the
tongue
in
an
almost
cloying
way
though
the
sweet
it
not
quite
too
much
light
notes
of
citrus
and
pine
are
also
present
but
very
light
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
as
a
barleywine
should
be
moving
over
the
tongue
nicely
and
leaving
it
sticky
but
dry
while
the
sides
of
the
mouth
wet
themselves
to
try
and
manage
the
hoppy
bitters
overall
i
think
i
like
the
flying
mouflan
its
different
and
nowhere
near
as
sweet
as
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
which
i
actually
like
i
would
love
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
and
see
how
the
juicy
hops
play
with
it
but
as
it
stands
it
was
a
nice
sipper
with
beautiful
notes
of
brown
sugar
though
nothing
too
special
the
drawback
to
this
beer
was
definitely
the
aspirin
bitters
that
assault
the
tongue
in
the
close
and
aftertaste
im
newer
to
the
barleywine
style
so
im
not
quite
sure
how
to
judge
this
one
on
style
but
on
its
own
i
think
it
is
a
nice
beer
with
a
little
bit
of
a
bitters
problem
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
nothing
to
pass
up
either
overall
this
beer
keeps
giving
me
a
little
bit
when
i
think
it
should
be
giving
me
more
more
more
its
not
bad
at
all
but
it
lacks
a
certain
je
na
sais
quoi
that
i
wish
i
could
articulate
better
its
definitely
worth
a
try
though
overall
a
good
barleywine
pretty
simple
all
around
probably
not
something
ill
seek
out
again
not
enough
sweetness
for
me
o
nice
bottle
to
cellar
but
i
do
have
to
say
i
remember
liking
this
better
when
fresh
the
hop
character
was
obviously
stronger
and
lent
itself
nicely
to
the
rest
of
the
beer
o
i
love
barleywines
both
kinds
as
well
as
wee
heavies
and
old
ales
and
i
was
really
pleased
with
this
beer
supercomplexity
rich
flavors
tons
of
fruit
and
citrus
and
deep
savory
malt
flavors
and
aromas
bought
it
blind
because
i
didnt
even
know
it
was
a
barleywine
but
just
saw
the
one
random
bottle
on
the
shelf
and
it
rang
a
bell
somehow
thank
you
bells
in
my
head
o
it
isnt
perfect
but
its
a
hoppy
barleywine
that
does
a
great
job
of
refusing
to
forsake
its
malt
backbone
for
hop
domination
on
a
personal
note
im
not
terribly
fond
of
the
burnt
caramel
malt
backbone
but
reviewing
it
objectively
it
still
works
well
with
everything
else
going
on
not
what
i
expected
from
a
barleywine
but
exactly
what
i
expected
from
a
revved
up
nugget
nectar
in
spite
of
its
numerous
merits
though
id
take
nn
over
this
quite
easily
still
a
very
nice
barleywine
though
poured
into
an
over
sized
wine
glass
a
rich
burnt
orange
infused
bronze
with
a
sticky
12
finger
off
white
headbrillinat
definition
and
color
chocolate
and
fruity
hops
with
alcohol
notes
in
the
nose
like
the
bottle
says
hops
dipped
in
chocolate
play
a
big
role
on
the
palatebrown
sugar
and
sweet
alcohol
round
out
the
palate
a
great
american
style
barleywine
with
its
big
hops
and
big
alcoholfantastic
stuff
a
fine
example
of
an
american
barleywine
the
bitterness
was
there
all
along
and
a
great
malt
bill
without
too
much
cloyingly
sweet
caramel
malts
makes
this
very
drinkable
this
is
one
totally
rad
bw
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
sip
on
for
a
long
time
overall
a
well
constructed
and
tasty
barley
wine
that
i
always
look
forward
to
drinking
o
really
good
barleywine
smells
wonderful
and
is
so
smooth
overall
complex
innovative
and
very
enjoyable
the
troegs
brothers
have
done
well
again
overall
i
was
really
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
theres
no
doubt
about
it
its
a
hopforward
and
then
some
american
barleywine
so
when
it
comes
to
the
bwines
if
you
likem
warming
and
you
likem
potently
hoppy
then
go
ahead
give
it
a
try
if
you
are
like
me
and
prefer
your
barleywines
less
resinous
and
bitter
look
elsewhere
o
a
very
nice
drinkable
barleywine
this
is
a
real
nice
barleywine
good
balance
nice
sweet
tones
with
just
a
touch
of
noticeable
malt
presence
the
only
drawback
is
a
bit
of
a
burn
of
alcohol
but
it
really
isnt
that
much
too
often
barleywines
just
arent
there
but
this
one
is
nice
id
go
for
this
any
day
overall
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
tried
hoppy
sweet
and
quite
enjoyable
this
was
an
amazing
barley
wine
and
probably
surpasses
sn
bigfoot
by
a
small
margin
paring
the
beer
with
the
brisket
was
probably
one
element
that
added
to
the
enjoyable
experience
i
snagged
a
22oz
bomber
for
my
cellar
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
a
nice
choice
for
a
slow
sipper
on
a
cold
day
best
in
small
quantities
overall
an
incredibly
drinkable
barleywine
one
of
the
best
out
there
for
both
balance
and
drinkability
honesty
however
this
one
may
actually
be
more
if
an
english
style
barleywine
even
if
that
wasnt
the
brewers
intention
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
is
very
hard
to
find
this
beer
not
many
people
have
heard
of
it
o
although
there
is
certainly
nothing
bad
about
fm
i
remember
enjoying
it
more
last
year
however
that
is
not
to
detract
from
my
review
as
this
is
an
excellent
beer
on
an
absolute
scale
final
thoughts
do
yourself
a
favor
and
treat
yourself
to
at
least
one
bottle
of
this
seasonal
offering
overall
i
wouldnt
equate
it
to
nugget
nectar
as
troegs
suggests
the
malt
is
the
main
star
here
it
is
thick
chewy
and
has
plenty
of
flavor
troegs
advertises
this
brew
as
nugget
nectar
pushed
off
of
a
cliff
and
then
rolled
in
chocolate
the
chocolate
is
there
but
the
hops
though
present
in
strength
are
not
as
complex
or
as
satisfying
as
nugget
nectar
even
with
the
strong
hop
presence
this
brew
is
too
sweet
the
flavors
compete
rather
than
balance
each
other
out
the
strong
alcohol
presence
combined
with
the
hops
does
create
a
warming
effect
im
a
big
fan
of
barleywines
but
this
may
have
just
been
a
tad
too
sweetstrong
for
my
liking
medium
bodied
decent
mouthfeel
but
a
cloying
sweetness
and
alcohol
heavy
aftertaste
ruin
it
a
bit
for
me
still
an
above
average
beer
all
around
but
for
a
specialty
22
oz
beer
im
not
sure
ill
be
coming
back
to
this
one
o
excellent
barley
wine
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
and
a
bit
sweet
but
quite
complex
very
bold
but
well
designed
the
hops
in
this
are
a
godsend
for
the
barley
wines
as
a
style
and
id
love
to
see
more
breweries
emulate
this
beer
o
while
this
one
is
very
good
it
is
not
as
good
as
some
of
troegs
other
offerings
it
has
a
unique
malt
character
with
a
good
pine
bite
alcohol
isnt
noticeable
but
i
would
have
been
satisfied
with
one
11
oz
pour
rather
than
two
nice
value
compared
to
some
of
the
other
barleywines
out
there
bottle
poured
a
deep
burgundy
color
ale
with
a
rather
larger
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
pretty
good
lacing
aroma
of
piney
hops
and
caramelized
malt
is
really
nice
taste
is
also
a
nice
mix
between
some
quite
strong
piney
hops
with
light
resin
notes
and
some
caramelized
malt
with
light
notes
of
toffee
and
well
balanced
residual
sugar
level
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
pretty
solid
interpretation
of
american
hops
heavy
barleywine
that
i
wouldnt
mind
revisiting
again
in
the
future
overall
i
think
this
is
at
an
odd
aging
point
the
hops
have
faded
but
the
sweetness
is
still
too
overpowering
worth
a
try
but
get
it
fresh
or
age
it
more
o
maybe
a
little
much
to
drink
lots
of
4
overall
i
am
going
to
pick
up
a
couple
more
bottles
and
let
them
age
this
is
a
nice
barleywine
a
great
beer
totally
solid
this
is
a
great
beer
its
complex
rich
balanced
and
smooth
i
usually
dislike
candied
sugar
notes
in
my
beers
but
here
somehow
it
works
it
folds
right
in
with
the
dark
fruit
and
caramel
i
really
enjoyed
this
sample
thanks
again
guys
o
very
good
barleywine
complex
flavors
and
very
drinkable
on
the
label
they
compare
it
to
pushing
nugget
nectar
off
a
cliff
i
love
nugget
nectar
honestly
more
than
this
really
good
beer
but
i
would
never
turn
this
bad
boy
down
next
year
i
will
pick
up
at
least
four
bottles
so
that
i
can
do
a
better
job
of
cellaring
originally
reviewed
06212011
overall
fell
a
little
short
of
what
i
expected
but
still
very
solid
i
have
an
11
and
12
aging
in
the
cellar
looking
forward
to
see
what
time
does
for
the
flying
mouflan
good
job
troegs
would
recommend
this
is
so
far
the
best
american
barleywine
that
i
have
had
it
really
has
the
balance
that
i
was
always
looking
for
in
this
style
though
my
experience
is
quite
limited
i
feel
it
does
what
a
barleywine
should
though
highly
recommended
certainly
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
had
recently
more
complex
and
sippable
than
the
common
sweet
syrupy
hop
flashes
from
the
22
oz
bottle
bought
at
the
foodery
in
philadelphia
overall
this
is
a
nice
tasty
brew
it
has
very
nice
robust
aroma
taste
and
warmingcreamy
feel
it
is
very
satisfying
and
enjoyable
great
for
sitting
back
in
a
recliner
and
sipping
away
quite
nice
worthy
of
repeated
pickups
4
o
a
very
much
under
appreciated
am
barleywine
it
balances
so
many
different
flavors
it
is
a
great
tasting
barleywine
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
think
this
is
the
wrong
glass
the
beer
is
a
dark
cloudy
ruby
blood
red
coloring
with
a
thin
dense
small
bubbled
light
brown
head
aromas
of
sweet
layered
malts
and
a
citrus
hops
balance
malt
smells
of
nut
toffee
and
chocolate
with
an
earthy
overtone
smells
great
flavors
are
roasty
toasty
initially
with
a
rich
and
tangy
caramel
and
toffee
backbone
highlighted
by
some
resiny
bitter
hops
good
solid
lacing
left
behind
as
you
drink
very
well
balanced
and
very
smooth
bodied
the
beer
has
a
slightly
cloying
sweet
and
bitter
balanced
aftertaste
the
finish
is
rich
and
smooth
with
a
slight
linger
from
the
resiny
hops
solid
brew
would
be
interesting
to
age
body
was
the
best
feature
here
about
full
a
nice
creamy
carbonation
just
a
faint
warming
a
nice
drinking
sipper
soft
on
the
palate
that
was
the
first
texture
i
noticed
it
has
a
full
body
light
carbonation
and
is
incredibly
creamy
the
creamy
head
just
adds
to
it
defiantly
a
sipping
beer
i
would
buy
a
case
of
this
next
time
i
see
it
notes
when
i
tasted
it
again
with
18
months
of
age
on
it
the
bitterness
had
mellowed
somewhat
and
if
anything
tasted
a
little
better
for
being
more
ibu
mellow
the
only
thing
keeping
the
scores
down
slightly
is
the
freshness
issue
and
if
this
is
this
years
then
what
happened
to
the
hoppy
bitterness
o
a
nice
barleywine
liked
the
hop
presence
here
very
drinkable
and
smooth
no
harshness
o
good
stuff
i
wish
troegs
distributed
in
my
state
so
i
could
taste
test
this
every
month
as
it
ages
what
a
nice
great
the
flying
mouflan
is
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
awhile
definitely
recommended
for
american
barleywine
fans
i
enjoyed
this
barleywine
very
much
and
would
recommend
it
if
you
like
a
hoppy
kick
to
yours
o
very
good
this
is
still
good
even
at
almost
a
year
old
oddly
for
a
barley
wine
though
i
dont
recommend
cellaring
it
color
is
brown
with
some
orange
hues
the
head
was
white
to
offwhite
peachy
leaving
behind
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
rich
full
citrus
hops
tangerines
oranges
grapefruits
full
bodied
caramel
and
chocolate
too
the
flavor
followed
suite
a
really
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
was
balanced
full
malts
not
quite
sticky
with
a
huge
hop
bite
o
the
fruit
and
caramel
beg
for
a
little
sweetness
of
which
this
has
almost
none
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
malty
ale
with
dark
fruit
and
caramel
flavors
o
very
grateful
for
getting
the
chance
to
try
this
foreign
elixir
would
love
to
throw
one
or
two
in
the
cellar
some
day
straight
to
my
wants
o
i
will
buy
this
whenever
i
see
it
again
now
i
am
not
afraid
to
buy
the
case
that
is
required
by
pa
law
i
know
there
are
a
bunch
of
friends
in
chicago
that
will
enjoy
overall
a
pretty
nice
barleywine
and
a
bit
more
aggressive
than
most
ill
age
my
other
and
im
curious
to
see
how
it
turns
out
overall
a
nicely
done
barleywine
good
flavor
and
well
balanced
i
usually
prefer
these
type
of
beers
with
a
bit
more
fresh
hop
flavors
still
balanced
but
this
was
quite
enjoyable
out
of
a
bottle
this
barleywine
was
a
hazy
woody
color
with
lots
of
foam
the
retention
was
a
good
and
it
left
bands
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
full
of
hops
toffee
booze
and
figs
the
flavors
were
a
bit
much
maybe
its
just
me
and
i
was
really
surprised
but
this
beer
kinda
of
let
me
down
yes
i
did
taste
all
the
complex
notes
of
figs
citrus
caramel
and
something
akin
to
hotcrossedbuns
but
the
booze
for
me
was
so
punchy
and
the
hops
so
aggressive
i
just
couldnt
get
into
it
it
must
be
my
personal
preference
but
i
like
what
i
like
so
screw
you
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
full
and
the
carbonation
medium
id
still
recommend
it
because
i
believe
people
should
form
their
own
opinions
but
i
just
wasnt
wowed
22oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
an
inch
of
light
brown
head
lots
of
lacing
aroma
is
boozey
with
dark
fruits
earthiness
and
some
maple
syrup
taste
is
of
burnt
brown
sugar
dark
fruits
booze
and
maple
syrup
sweet
and
boozey
earthy
finish
heavy
mouthfeel
a
bit
too
much
of
the
dark
fruit
and
sweet
taste
but
its
a
decent
brew
im
a
big
fan
of
barleywines
and
this
one
isnt
one
of
the
best
but
worth
grabbing
overall
worth
trying
o
this
has
really
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
the
flavor
is
awesome
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
and
an
awesome
representation
of
the
style
it
has
the
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
and
hop
ratio
for
an
american
barleywine
i
definitely
recommend
checking
this
one
out
it
is
totally
worth
it
i
will
buy
this
one
again
after
a
year
in
the
cellar
silky
sweet
and
seductive
9
3
is
totally
hidden
i
dont
get
the
full
hop
blast
either
especially
not
the
pleasant
abrasiveness
of
dry
nugget
in
nugget
nectar
no
chocolate
notes
like
the
brewery
says
either
overall
a
mellow
killer
medium
to
full
bodied
with
excellent
carbonation
this
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
considering
the
9
3
abv
the
heaviness
of
the
body
really
allows
the
flavors
to
come
out
and
coats
your
mouth
well
without
becoming
overly
sticky
the
carbonation
is
rather
fizzy
and
really
helps
to
keep
this
beer
from
being
a
hot
sticky
mess
huge
surprise
impulse
buy
and
one
that
i
definitely
dont
regret
great
price
and
it
definitely
lives
up
to
he
troegs
quality
i
expect
o
an
incredibly
balanced
and
straight
up
delicious
barleywine
from
troegs
i
was
shocked
at
how
good
it
was
o
very
nice
barleywine
and
a
nice
one
from
troegs
good
flavor
profile
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
this
fresh
for
comparison
but
even
after
20
months
has
a
good
hop
character
poured
from
a
brown
22
oz
bottle
has
a
pretty
dark
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
dark
fruits
a
touch
of
sweetness
taste
is
not
sweet
alcohol
up
front
some
fruits
more
alcohol
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
beer
given
its
high
reviews
d
a
great
holiday
beer
but
one
that
must
be
consumed
with
care
and
the
right
snifter
glass
drink
this
with
someone
who
is
well
versed
on
barleywine
and
how
to
properly
approach
this
best
good
stuff
but
be
careful
o
ive
had
this
before
and
will
continue
having
it
every
year
its
released
truly
a
beer
that
defies
style
characteristics
overall
a
great
barleywine
for
sure
you
should
definitely
try
it
if
youre
in
to
the
style
and
if
not
this
is
a
solid
introduction
reddish
brown
in
color
with
a
deep
haze
poured
with
a
big
sturdy
beige
foam
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
sweet
sugary
amber
malt
aroma
smooth
and
thick
feel
but
not
too
heavy
amber
and
roasted
malt
flavors
up
front
ripe
dark
fruit
thru
the
middle
floral
hop
bitterness
from
middle
to
end
with
a
brief
chocolate
flavor
at
the
finish
finishes
with
a
boozy
lingering
light
pine
hop
after
this
is
a
go
too
barleywine
in
pa
flying
mouflan
is
a
mighty
tasty
beer
everything
you
would
expect
for
a
barleywine
with
some
added
depth
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
pretty
full
bodied
with
a
lingering
flavor
sort
of
an
earthy
feel
the
whole
way
through
so
its
a
little
gritty
but
theres
a
moderate
carbonation
level
still
the
9
3
alcohol
level
is
pretty
well
masked
and
this
beer
is
really
drinkable
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
awesome
full
flavored
cellerable
and
just
tasty
plus
this
beer
is
in
the
5
range
so
the
value
is
insanely
good
always
scores
bonus
points
with
me
when
a
beer
is
awesome
and
financially
friendly
another
solid
lineup
from
troegs
o
this
was
a
pretty
decent
barelywine
a
little
too
hoppy
on
the
finish
but
still
some
great
caramel
and
vanilla
notes
overall
a
deliciously
fullbodied
and
wellbalanced
barleywine
this
thing
is
fragrant
as
all
get
out
and
very
enjoyable
overall
this
beer
is
great
and
tastes
like
it
will
get
better
and
better
with
age
if
given
the
chance
it
will
smooth
out
further
and
probably
decrease
the
hot
alcohols
not
that
they
were
a
problem
with
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
solid
american
barleywine
i
think
that
i
prefer
barleywines
with
less
hops
but
the
hops
from
this
barleywine
add
nice
degree
of
complexity
without
going
over
the
top
with
the
bitterness
overall
a
great
american
barleywine
it
doesnt
outdo
itself
in
the
hops
but
uses
them
subtly
and
masterfully
setting
itself
apart
from
others
in
the
style
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
1
inch
puffy
khaki
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
citrus
zest
citrus
fruit
and
some
malt
aromas
taste
is
of
citrus
zest
citrus
fruit
malt
and
some
subdued
cocoa
powder
on
the
aftertaste
a
mild
hop
bitterness
sticks
to
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
carbonation
level
with
a
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
barleywine
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
overall
this
is
a
tasty
and
well
made
barleywine
it
tastes
like
one
that
could
be
enjoyed
both
fresh
and
with
some
years
under
its
belt
overall
this
one
solidified
my
preference
for
englishstyle
barleywines
while
mouflan
is
true
to
style
and
is
highlyrated
i
dont
find
myself
wanting
to
finish
a
whole
glass
of
it
nonetheless
if
you
like
americanstyle
barleywines
please
give
this
one
a
shot
d
a
great
beer
ill
definitely
have
again
i
hope
to
find
it
in
sizes
smaller
than
bombers
deep
brown
with
reddish
hues
and
a
whispy
head
that
slowly
reduces
to
offwhite
swirls
the
nose
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
plenty
of
earthy
tones
mixed
in
the
palate
covers
a
wide
spectrum
of
flavors
sweet
dark
fruits
that
compliment
the
warm
boozy
elements
are
met
with
earthy
and
piney
hops
that
bring
a
nice
balance
to
the
whole
thing
low
carbonation
and
a
velvety
mouthfeel
fit
the
style
nicely
and
make
it
an
easy
sipper
i
loved
this
brew
from
the
start
and
it
only
got
better
as
it
warmed
toward
the
end
of
the
bottle
a
well
conceived
barleywine
overall
this
is
really
well
done
these
guys
made
a
real
solid
barleywine
pours
a
deep
murky
brown
with
no
visible
light
present
except
around
the
edges
the
brown
is
like
a
deep
leather
there
is
a
thin
tan
color
head
which
recedes
to
a
skim
half
and
nothiness
half
the
aroma
is
of
deep
piney
hops
along
with
dark
fruits
the
taste
starts
with
a
piney
and
earthy
hop
bite
which
gives
way
to
dark
fruits
and
figs
along
with
a
mellow
milk
chocolate
taste
the
end
has
a
nice
deep
burn
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
it
is
a
sipper
for
sure
but
very
good
and
very
enjoyable
o
definitely
love
this
one
if
i
had
a
nickel
for
every
time
troegs
let
me
down
id
have
zero
money
overall
a
very
nice
glass
will
very
likely
age
extremely
well
and
cant
wait
to
taste
those
results
in
a
year
or
so
pours
a
deep
brown
amber
an
appetizing
12
slight
brown
head
diminishes
after
a
few
sips
nice
lacing
aware
of
hops
as
soon
as
i
cracked
the
bottle
earthy
hops
deep
malts
some
oak
in
the
nose
my
first
sip
made
me
smile
malty
sweet
and
hop
bitter
throughout
such
a
full
flavor
and
over
so
quick
no
problem
though
this
only
encourages
more
sipping
mouthfeel
is
terrific
superfine
carbonation
if
any
goes
over
the
palate
smoothly
and
pleasantly
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
one
i
will
certainly
be
buying
again
the
9
3
is
noticeable
only
on
inspection
it
is
hidden
under
a
rich
full
flavor
which
is
hugely
drinkable
love
troegs
take
on
the
barleywine
malty
and
hoppy
and
bold
overall
grade
b
bottle
says
that
it
ages
well
and
im
sure
that
it
does
but
personally
im
glad
i
tried
it
fresher
because
the
hops
were
very
prevalent
still
with
malts
that
still
did
what
they
were
supposed
to
do
if
youre
a
hophead
try
it
fresh
or
buy
two
and
compare
fresh
to
aged
despite
the
abv
the
drinkability
is
high
for
a
barleywine
its
a
sipper
after
dinner
beer
i
plan
on
stocking
up
on
any
and
all
bottles
i
see
from
this
spring
release
and
hope
to
do
a
review
with
some
significant
age
o
my
first
experience
with
a
barleywine
and
definitely
a
good
one
i
can
see
why
people
talk
this
brew
up
i
would
be
interested
to
see
how
this
ages
possibility
to
see
that
in
the
next
year
or
so
fingers
crossed
overall
extremely
smooth
no
alcohol
warming
or
taste
the
year
and
a
half
in
the
bottle
seems
to
have
done
well
for
this
though
i
must
admit
i
have
not
had
this
beer
fresh
but
can
only
assume
fresh
it
is
a
bit
more
hot
an
enjoyable
barlywine
glad
to
be
able
to
try
it
overall
very
impressed
with
this
one
i
dont
normally
like
barleywines
that
much
but
this
one
was
very
enjoyable
overall
a
nice
and
complex
barleywine
for
the
money
i
would
certainly
buy
this
again
and
see
how
it
is
fresher
a
sipper
but
one
i
will
revisit
a
gift
from
my
wonderful
wife
this
beer
is
a
deep
brown
color
nearly
nonexistent
head
the
aroma
is
quite
malty
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
some
highly
roasted
scents
that
arent
barleywineesque
but
are
still
very
fitting
for
this
beer
some
alcohol
is
notable
in
the
smell
but
this
characteristic
comes
out
seriously
in
the
taste
boozy
malty
sweet
bitterness
balances
the
sweetness
full
in
body
and
very
drinkable
o
this
is
a
damn
fine
and
delicious
beer
i
like
this
one
a
lot
and
think
the
troegs
brothers
did
a
great
job
it
is
easily
palatable
and
not
nearly
as
harsh
as
some
other
barley
wines
i
have
had
good
stuff
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
long
time
and
it
didnt
disappoint
excellent
american
style
barleywine
with
plenty
of
aggressive
hops
yet
with
a
solid
malty
backbone
underneath
3
5
d
honestly
im
a
bit
shocked
every
other
time
ive
had
this
ive
enjoyed
it
much
more
of
course
i
never
had
it
around
the
six
month
period
it
seems
like
im
right
in
the
middle
of
this
beers
awkward
stage
i
think
i
might
rereview
this
at
the
one
year
mark
when
this
is
fresh
the
hops
pop
and
give
it
a
malty
dipa
vibe
when
this
is
old
the
malts
really
shine
right
now
i
cant
say
either
of
those
things
it
pours
a
murky
copper
brown
color
with
a
filmy
tan
head
that
left
a
ton
of
lacing
right
of
the
bat
you
can
smell
fruity
juicy
hops
i
noticed
aromas
of
grapefruit
and
tangerine
with
lots
of
candied
caramel
and
a
hint
of
maple
and
sugar
cookie
it
tastes
of
dark
fruits
and
caramel
candy
with
brown
sugar
some
citrus
hops
in
the
back
ground
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
beer
is
thick
and
low
in
carbonation
with
a
warming
lingering
finish
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
one
of
my
favorites
so
far
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
not
too
thick
overall
its
good
barleywine
but
not
something
id
seek
out
very
often
overall
one
of
my
favorites
and
i
was
super
happy
to
have
it
finally
on
tap
lets
hope
it
starts
showing
up
more
in
the
future
with
the
new
troegs
facility
ps
i
love
this
beer
fresh
a
great
beer
sweet
but
could
use
more
balance
early
as
it
really
surrenders
to
the
sweetness
rather
than
controlling
it
into
the
right
direction
nice
though
d
this
is
good
very
very
hoppy
veryvery
malty
so
well
integrated
it
is
amazing
complexity
galore
astoundingly
rich
robust
but
it
does
not
flaunt
its
heft
it
just
invites
you
in
and
then
slowly
puts
a
twinkle
in
your
eyes
and
a
smile
your
face
a
fantastic
brew
smooth
clean
rounded
and
deliciously
balanced
this
is
pure
beer
crackdelicious
devilish
and
devious
the
sort
of
beer
that
sucks
you
in
makes
you
fall
in
love
and
then
cracks
you
on
the
head
with
a
vase
the
next
day
reading
other
very
enthusiastic
reviews
im
not
even
certain
i
had
the
same
beer
aroma
was
lovely
and
it
looks
great
but
this
just
seemed
wildly
overhopped
to
me
like
a
glass
of
thick
grapefruit
juice
with
the
malty
goodness
i
detected
in
the
nose
completely
overpowered
by
citrus
citrus
citrus
i
love
troegs
maybe
this
one
is
just
not
my
style
drink
another
beer
i
was
super
glad
to
get
a
shot
at
i
would
love
a
bottle
of
this
at
home
quite
tasty
and
well
balanced
mouthfeel
pretty
thick
bodied
and
carbonated
well
creamy
and
smooth
was
a
top
for
me
as
far
as
american
barleys
overall
a
very
nice
interpretation
of
the
american
barleywine
from
the
guys
at
troegs
they
never
fail
to
impress
overall
smoothe
mouthfeel
sweet
taste
strong
abv
gorgeous
appearance
whats
not
to
like
o
a
good
barleywine
that
isnt
too
hoppy
or
too
sweet
o
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
had
definitely
true
to
the
american
style
of
hopping
the
hell
out
of
everything
but
still
manages
to
maintain
a
decent
balance
between
the
hops
and
the
darker
flavors
ill
definitely
be
adding
this
back
to
the
wants
drinkability
what
a
classic
example
of
an
american
bw
hops
galore
this
might
be
too
bitter
for
my
taste
when
fresh
but
someday
ill
try
if
new
just
for
comparison
i
love
the
lesser
bitterness
but
maintained
huge
hoppiness
overall
very
good
strong
barleywine
great
rich
flavors
i
have
not
had
the
most
recent
batch
to
compare
the
2009
with
so
i
dont
if
the
aging
has
helped
the
flavor
any
o
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
beers
ive
had
even
my
friends
who
arent
into
good
beer
very
much
enjoyed
this
very
excited
to
open
a
couple
more
of
these
and
drink
them
thanks
especially
to
littleb
with
hooking
me
up
with
multiple
bottles
of
this
world
class
o
overall
its
really
good
its
not
over
the
top
like
most
barleywines
which
is
what
i
like
the
most
about
it
i
would
recommend
it
and
would
drink
it
again
glad
i
waited
and
aged
this
beer
it
is
just
wonderful
o
great
example
for
the
style
and
something
i
would
have
again
i
enjoy
a
balance
to
my
barleywines
and
this
one
is
just
that
good
stuff
doverall
i
really
liked
this
barelywine
very
flavorful
and
a
nice
balance
would
drink
thi
anytime
i
could
very
crisp
and
clean
very
clean
and
wellmade
just
enough
sharpness
and
a
sweetness
that
doesnt
get
too
close
to
the
edge
generous
gift
from
wino47
poured
into
bells
tulip
the
color
is
classic
barleywine
dark
copper
and
cloudy
with
touches
of
red
on
the
edge
nice
finger
of
head
is
a
light
tan
like
espresso
crema
the
nose
is
faint
burnt
sugar
and
malt
with
some
hoppiness
nothing
exciting
taste
is
much
better
nice
hops
up
front
piney
and
fresh
the
weight
is
good
and
the
middle
is
malty
and
heavy
with
caramel
and
lemon
peel
the
finish
is
heavily
bitter
and
a
little
to
alcoholic
for
my
taste
overall
a
good
beer
i
would
drink
again
without
hesitation
if
i
had
another
bottle
i
would
give
it
a
year
let
the
hops
bitterness
and
alcohol
fade
making
way
for
the
nicer
caramel
and
malt
o
amazing
barley
wine
for
one
tried
so
young
almost
no
alcohol
heat
and
well
balanced
and
easily
drinkable
i
will
be
cellaring
a
few
bottles
to
see
how
they
come
about
but
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
watch
the
alcohol
though
because
it
sneaks
up
o
a
sipper
it
is
very
filling
one
22oz
is
all
you
need
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
barleywine
but
nothing
otherworldly
a
solid
ab
range
beer
o
a
great
beer
i
would
actually
call
it
a
dipabarleywine
mix
because
of
the
hop
presence
this
beer
is
very
sweet
but
remains
surprisingly
balanced
throughout
the
alcohol
really
sneaks
up
on
you
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
more
dominate
with
hops
than
malts
but
the
malts
come
through
nicely
great
try
i
really
like
this
beer
and
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
in
dryness
and
hop
content
it
reminds
me
of
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
barleywine
style
ale
which
is
one
of
my
personal
favorites
this
brew
is
a
true
hopped
up
american
style
barleywine
you
never
notice
the
9
3
abv
as
it
is
buried
by
the
distinct
hops
and
malt
of
this
brew
extremely
enjoyable
i
will
be
looking
for
this
when
it
is
released
next
april
overall
my
favorite
barleywine
and
i
look
forward
to
this
each
and
every
year
yet
another
reason
why
i
feel
that
troegs
has
the
best
seasonal
line
up
of
any
brewery
great
balance
i
cant
wait
to
do
my
vertical
o
what
a
fantastic
reintroduction
to
barleywines
this
is
far
better
than
any
other
of
the
breed
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
try
ill
certainly
recommend
to
my
friends
and
will
seek
it
out
again
just
simply
a
work
of
art
tastes
are
lacedlacy
booze
caramel
sweetened
butter
margarine
rye
breadcrumbs
malty
sweetness
some
hops
low
lovibond
malts
wheat
goat
milk
milk
sugar
and
dark
fruits
smell
like
oxidized
liquors
herbs
fruits
potato
skins
breath
and
white
meat
o
this
is
a
great
beer
even
at
a
ripe
young
age
of
2
months
if
you
like
balanced
barleywines
that
arent
too
hot
to
start
off
this
one
is
for
you
the
cpj
d
the
high
abv
aside
it
is
quite
drinkable
o
very
drinkable
awesome
mouthfeel
and
good
hop
bill
but
not
a
hop
bomb
like
bigfoot
its
really
balanced
main
complaint
is
that
tart
tangyness
that
gives
you
a
slightly
uncomfortable
taste
mid
sip
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
develops
although
my
guess
would
be
that
the
tartness
is
going
to
come
out
a
lot
more
this
is
a
big
one
that
really
coats
the
mouth
probably
would
enjoy
more
after
some
cellar
time
given
the
heat
at
the
end
but
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
barley
wine
the
body
was
appropriately
full
not
too
rich
or
sticky
with
a
clean
finish
drinkability
was
nice
and
easy
for
the
style
and
went
smoothly
overall
a
very
good
example
of
what
youre
looking
for
from
a
bw
worth
seeking
out
overall
i
liked
this
beer
for
its
cocoa
caramel
pine
hop
candy
taste
heavy
and
a
workout
on
your
palette
it
is
still
very
tastey
overall
i
think
ive
hit
an
awkward
point
with
this
beer
its
been
on
the
shelves
for
a
few
weeks
so
its
possible
the
hoppiness
ive
enjoyed
in
samplings
has
diminished
a
little
bit
more
than
really
fresh
its
in
the
smell
but
not
in
the
taste
besides
some
lingering
bitterness
i
have
another
bottle
im
laying
down
for
a
year
or
two
so
will
report
back
if
there
is
significant
improvement
overall
still
enjoyable
wasnt
impressed
and
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
this
pours
a
rich
cloudy
tawny
amber
color
with
a
sandy
brown
foam
head
the
aromas
are
really
a
rich
caramel
smell
with
hints
of
both
lemon
which
i
assume
comes
from
the
hops
and
a
touch
of
cinnamon
the
taste
of
this
beer
has
a
deep
caramel
flavor
after
a
year
most
of
the
strong
flavors
of
hops
have
subsided
but
there
are
remnants
of
a
light
spicy
herbal
flavor
that
lingers
behind
the
rich
caramel
there
are
notes
of
vanilla
and
clove
in
the
flavor
as
well
but
they
are
minor
accents
there
is
a
bit
of
a
sting
on
the
end
of
the
sip
but
for
the
most
part
this
is
really
mellow
and
smooth
im
thinking
that
perhaps
i
should
have
laid
it
down
for
another
year
in
this
regard
overall
this
is
a
top
tier
barleywine
i
could
have
this
everyday
no
matter
the
weather
im
so
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
overall
it
gets
a
little
cloying
the
hops
are
nice
but
it
still
has
a
ton
of
toffee
that
is
a
little
much
cheers
this
beer
had
a
very
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
hoppiness
quality
and
care
seemed
evident
a
bit
more
hoppybitter
than
i
desire
but
still
very
respectable
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
rich
deep
brown
color
with
a
really
nice
tan
head
on
top
the
smell
is
just
over
the
top
with
hops
chocolate
and
some
alcohol
the
taste
is
strong
with
citrusy
bitterness
from
the
hops
upfront
as
is
settles
in
the
dark
chocolate
sweetness
and
dryness
take
effect
the
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
is
slightly
heavy
but
smooth
as
well
with
some
mellow
carbonation
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
very
good
i
may
like
this
moree
than
the
nugget
necter
i
feel
that
this
brew
has
more
complexity
through
out
the
entire
glass
its
awesome
in
my
opinion
and
ill
be
looking
to
buy
more
in
thr
future
i
bought
this
bottle
on
the
toes
only
had
no
idea
what
style
or
an
other
info
i
was
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
and
at
6
for
a
bomber
the
value
is
excellent
poured
a
thick
browndeep
ruby
color
with
a
large
amount
of
off
white
and
tan
head
the
nose
has
a
lot
of
red
wine
notes
such
as
prunes
black
currants
and
red
grapes
there
is
also
a
lot
of
heavy
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
some
piney
hop
notes
are
present
the
flavor
has
a
bitter
tang
upfront
with
a
quick
blast
of
some
piney
hops
right
after
you
swallow
the
heavy
roasted
barley
and
booze
shines
through
right
after
the
hops
a
complex
amount
of
sweetness
involved
with
the
malts
burnt
molasses
with
a
tingle
of
alcohol
and
a
fruity
dry
finish
there
is
a
heavy
amount
of
hops
well
balanced
with
a
heavy
amount
of
sugary
dark
malts
overall
this
is
a
sweet
but
balanced
barley
wine
i
am
interested
to
see
what
a
little
age
would
do
on
this
beer
but
am
definitely
concerned
that
it
might
become
overly
sweet
as
the
hops
fade
pours
a
thick
brown
though
you
can
see
some
light
through
it
no
head
and
a
nice
lace
top
it
off
smell
is
hopped
for
sure
but
with
a
subtle
sugary
undertone
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
too
taste
is
not
very
strong
at
all
there
is
the
natural
piney
hoppness
you
would
expect
from
a
barley
wine
but
not
too
strong
there
is
also
a
sugary
nuttiness
about
it
as
well
the
alcohol
is
there
and
that
keeps
this
a
sipper
it
is
actually
nicely
carbonated
and
not
harsh
going
down
has
the
warm
feeling
on
the
way
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
i
would
not
mind
having
another
and
certainly
kept
me
warm
this
evening
d
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
this
beer
gives
you
rich
complexity
and
the
best
of
both
worlds
of
malt
and
hops
it
was
great
from
the
start
all
the
way
to
the
finish
regardless
delicious
odthis
beer
is
simply
a
good
time
i
love
the
balance
and
the
assertive
taste
finally
i
decide
to
pick
up
a
bomber
of
this
and
i
am
not
disappointed
great
job
troegs
o
truly
enjoyed
this
beer
would
love
to
get
another
one
and
age
it
a
bit
easy
to
drink
but
can
only
have
12
of
these
at
a
time
because
of
the
high
abv
very
interesting
brew
poured
a
very
dark
amber
with
a
beige
head
a
good
lacing
throughout
aromas
were
of
mild
sweetness
some
candied
sugars
and
mild
chocolate
flavors
were
typical
of
a
sweet
barleywine
with
a
mild
hop
background
that
balanced
the
flavor
very
nicely
medium
bodied
texture
and
a
great
finish
very
unique
and
flavorful
beer
kind
of
like
someone
poured
a
snort
of
ipa
into
my
barleywine
cant
wait
to
have
this
one
again
overall
pretty
good
i
like
to
get
this
every
now
and
again
and
its
got
more
hoppiness
when
fresh
o
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
its
definitely
a
cousin
of
nugget
nectar
and
therefore
very
good
borderline
great
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
encourage
everyone
to
pick
it
up
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
this
style
cheers
overall
i
think
this
is
a
fairly
complex
and
enjoyable
beer
at
5
99bomber
its
by
far
the
best
bang
for
your
buck
in
the
bottle
shop
a
cloudy
dark
amber
with
an
inch
thick
off
white
head
that
has
great
retention
and
beautiful
lace
the
smell
is
mostly
sweet
malts
toffee
dark
fruit
and
spice
with
some
citrus
edges
the
taste
is
more
pronounced
with
thick
caramel
toffee
brown
sugar
and
cinnamon
with
dark
fruits
like
raisins
and
plums
hints
of
chocolate
and
roast
it
flows
from
sweet
in
the
front
to
bitter
in
the
back
as
it
leaves
a
citrus
grapefruit
orange
herbal
floral
and
pine
notes
on
the
back
end
very
interesting
and
complex
flavor
development
between
the
malts
and
hops
the
bottle
describes
it
well
it
is
like
a
dark
chocolate
and
candided
sugar
wrapped
hops
thick
smooth
and
velvety
this
is
malty
for
a
barleywine
sweet
very
enjoyable
and
interestingly
balanced
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
light
brown
head
in
the
aroma
caramel
toffee
and
a
small
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
toffee
caramel
and
a
hint
of
coffee
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
caramel
and
coffee
aftertaste
a
nice
caramel
sticky
smell
leading
into
and
dry
coffee
it
feels
boozy
but
not
mf
a
very
smooth
and
velvety
texture
wraps
around
the
teeth
and
invades
your
taste
buds
from
there
the
brew
kicks
back
and
stays
right
at
the
back
of
your
throat
and
this
is
where
i
initially
noticed
a
fantastic
warmth
from
the
alcohol
overall
this
is
great
i
really
want
to
compare
this
to
a
fresh
bottle
decent
could
drink
a
couple
had
a
few
bottles
over
the
course
of
a
few
months
the
hops
continue
to
fade
but
the
malt
hasnt
taken
over
yet
so
far
i
liked
better
fresh
d
a
tasty
beer
for
sure
but
so
big
and
so
sweet
as
to
not
be
terribly
drinkable
id
definitely
indulge
in
a
second
but
probably
wouldnt
want
a
third
in
one
sitting

very
nice

overall
and
one
i
would
gladly
have
again
quite
drinkable
as
well
considering
the
abv
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
complexity
a
solid
beer
thats
not
worth
seeking
out
but
is
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
around
d
fairly
drinkable
a
pretty
bit
beer
here
more
for
the
sipping
the
flavors
are
rich
and
bold
but
for
the
most
part
are
well
balanced
and
work
together
well
nice
hops
in
the
finish
overall
the
old
drinkability
score
would
get
a
5
this
is
immensely
poundable
but
the
new
overall
goes
down
and
thats
just
what
the

calls
for

as

this
is

it
is
really
an

i
want
to
see
what
some

does
to

a

will
really

i
am
impressed
with
this
beer
that
i
did
not
know
existed
until
i
saw
it
at
lenas
in
painesville
this
week
i
would
recommend
it
at
least
to
anyone
who
appreciated
nn
i
find
barleywines
to
be
particularly
not
drinkable
but
this
might
be
the
best
american
barleywine
after
the
sublime
great
lakes
barley
wine
and
it
is
certainly
better
than

it

barleywine

overall
this
has
been
a
tough
one
to
get
and
im
glad
i
procured
two

of
this
i
cant

enough
about
the

sometimes
gets
to
be

cliche

would
be
a

transition

if
any

shoot

it

a
very

barleywine
not
the
best
but
very
tastey
i
am
glad
i
have
one
to
age
i
think
this
beast
will
be
totally
changed
with
some
age
if
i
can
wait
that
long
i
dont
think
its
accurate
to
call
this
one
a
barleywine
its
more
like
a
strong
ale
with
lots
of
hops
its
really
a
good
beer
i
like
it
better
than
nugget
nectar
d
everything
seems
right
in
place
for
this
offering
by
troegs
so
many
different
well
balanced
aromas
and
tastes
like
other
reviews
before
me
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
one
bottle
oh
yeah
one
final
word
im
flying
and
im
a
sheep
drinkability
right
now
i
wish
i
bought
more
then
the
2
bottles
i
bought
will
be
buying
more
to
drink
now
and
to
age
the
beer
pours
a
dark

color
with
a
white

the
aroma
is
caramel
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
just
an
awesome
aroma
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
figs
raisins
molasses
caramel
and
brown
sugar
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
dawesomely
drinkable
at
9

it
is
remarkably
smooth
with
a
huge
amount
of
hops
malt
and
booze
to
make
any
beer
drinker
happy
if
you
find
this
dont
make
the
mistake
i
made
only
buying
one
bottle
hell
buy
a
case
and

some
of
it
its
worth

to
my
tastes
is
an
epitome
of
american
barleywine
a
case
of
it
should
be
locked
away
in
a
time
capsule
somewhere
i
sure
hope
well
continue
to
see
this
long
into
the
future

lovers
delight
drinkability
is
good
for
a
barleywine
i
set
out
to
do
the
bomber
by
myself
and
it
is
going
down
very
nicely
drinkability
was
good
overall
another
great
beer
from
troegs
and
one
of
the
stars
of
the
fest
imo
d
had
several
of
these
last
year
when
they
first
came
out
and
was
really
impressed
the
hops
were
so
nice
when
it
was
fresh
definitely
just
an
amped
up
nugget
nectar
how
can
you
go
wrong
with
that
after
a
year
the
hops
have
mellowed
quite
a
bit
and
has
arguably
made
this
a
better
barleywine
fresh
it
was
closer
to
an
imperial
ipa
now
definitely
a
barleywine
and
a
good
one
drinking
really
well
right
now
maybe
another
6
months
or
so
will
tame
the
hops
a
bit
more
and
make
this
absolutely
perfectly
balanced
great
beer
fresh
or
aged
but
at
this
point
in
time
aged
is
your
only
option
unless
they
make
it
again

was

but
the
lacing
is
good
aroma
is
caramel
malt
pine

citrusy

raisins
toffee
and
some

the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
theres
pine
and
citrus
hops
raisins
toffee
caramel
malt
and
molasses
flavors
all
noticable
nice
lingering
bitter
hoppy
finish
too
also
good
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
slick
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
although
i
think
this
is
more
of
a
sipping
beer
id
buy
this
again
i
thought
it
was
a
good
overall
brew
great
drinkability
for
the
style
overall
another
very
good
one
from
my
hometown
brewery
my
real
hometown
that
is
not
where
i
currently
live
impressive
looking
beer
clear
garnet
color
with
a
large
tan
head
with
surprising
lacing
and
retention
for
the
style
aroma
is
mildly
sweet
malty
slightly
boozy
punch
blended
with
mild
pine
hops
reminds
me
a
lot
of
nugget
nectar
with
a
robust
malt
backbone
and
at
this
point
the
hops
are
still
present
but
greatly
smoothed
out
medium
body
with
soft
carbonation
and
well
managed
alcohol
obviously
line
between
dipa
and
barleywine
can
be
a
thin
one
especially
with
age
and
id
describe
this
as
what
nn
would
be
if
it
aged
a
little
more
gracefully
as
mentioned
by
a
few
others
as
this
warms
up
a
mild
tea
like
flavor
from
the
hops
also
is
present
which
i
find
rather
pleasing
i
wouldnt
consider
this
an
exceptional
barleywine
but
theres
something
unique
and
extremely
drinkable
about
this
bomber
split
with
the
parents
at
bierria
paradiso
georgetown
notes
nothing
extraordinary
but
a
reliable
and
tasty
take
on
us
barleywines
drinkability
friends
theres
absolutely
no
doubt
about
it
its
a
hopforward
and
then
some
american
barleywine
so
when
it
comes
to
the
bwines
if
you
likem
warming
and
you
likem
potently
hoppy
then
go
ahead
give
it
a
try
d
a
slow
sipper
that
is
best
split
i
prefer
this
barleywine
fresh
drinkability
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
and
melded
noticeable
alcohol
at
the
end
very
sweet
filling
beer
great
flavor
makes
this
more
drinkable
than
it
otherwise
would
be
a
somewhat
cloudy
dark
root
beer
color
with
a
fair
light
tan
head
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
firm
pineyherbal
hop
with
a
luscious
malty
base
very
nice
and
chewy
the
flavor
brings
malt
and
licorice
blended
with
good
clover
hop
highlights
this
is
near
a
full
bodied
brew
with
silky
feel
and
decent
drinkability
for
the
style
very
fine
carbonation
with
a
hop
finish
that
lingers
long
and
sure
its
a
pleasure
and
great
for
drinking
or
with
some
sharp
cheddar
or
other
spicey
food
complements
nice
stuff
mouthfeel
is
medium
heavy
bodied
with
a
good
bite
of
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
very
dense
and
chewy
very
filling
and
perfect
for
an
evening
nightcap
d
mostly
a
slow
sipping
beer
for
me
one
was
enough
but
it
was
a
really
tasty
beer
and
one
i
am
glad
to
try
maybe
a
gateway
into
more
barleywines
for
me
this
beer

this
beer
is
rather
nice
sweet
caramel
with
some
nice
spicy
notes
roasted
barley
vanilla
hint
of
bananas
some

the
flavor
is

and
good
large
caramel
and
roasted

flavor
along
with
spicy
alcohol
ripe
fruit
and
a

this
is
a

tasty
beer
this

has
a
thick
and
silky
mouthfeel
with
some
nice

in
the

i
must
say
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
first
wheatwine
i
have
ever
had
and
i
would
say
it
is
a

i

sweet

midway
and
to
the
finish
lots
and
lots
of
hops
making
this
practically
an
iipa
yum
very
nice
stuff
the
pine
hop
bitterness
just
hangs
on
forever
into
the
after
taste
six
months
in
the
cellar
was
clearly
not
enough
for
this
beer
putting
too
much
age
on
this
however
might
result
in
a
flat
sticky
mess
the
carbonation
in
my
example
was
already
quite
low
this
definitely
needs
some
careful
cellaring
to
unveil
its
true
potential
pours
reddish
amber
with
a
thin
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
smells
of
a
slightly
fruity
hoppiness
but
with
a
light
touch
the
taste
is
more
satisfying
with
deep
citrusy
and
tropical
fruit
hop
notes
and
some
sweet
alcoholic
notes
as
well
goes
down
rich
sweet
and
with
enough
lingering
bitterness
to
balance
quite
nice
well
its
no
surprise
that
this
is
an
excellent
beer
as
i
thought
the
scratch
4
was
one
of
the
best
beers
in
troegs
portoflio
i
stand
by
that
statement
with
this
one
excellent
a
terrific
barleywine
from
troegs
and
perfect
for
the
coming
of
fall
d
a
terrific
beer
but
if
i
could
find
one
area
for
improvement
in
the
lovely
brew
it
would
be
for
it
mellow
out
slightly
aging
one
of
these
is
recommended
aside
from
that
this
is
an
absolutely
terrific
and
unique
taste
on
the
barleywine
d
very
good
for
a
barleywine
of
this
strength
well
done
troegs
now
just
do
more

was
not
that
hot
of
a
beer
there
was
a
slight
sourness
to
this
beer
as
well
mouthfeel
is
moderate
to
thick
for
a
bwine
worth
trying
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
d
for
the
style
and
for
the
abv
i
would
consider
it
drinkable
i
dont
think
i
could
have
another
glass
tonight
but
if
i
can
find
more
bottles
i
will
buy
them
right
away
drinkability
good
but
one
is
enough
at
almost
10
seek
out
if
you
can
find
apparently
this
was
a
limited
run

a

barleywine
thanks
drinks
far
too
easily
would
recommend
perfect
for
having
a
sipper
on
the
back
porch
after
dark
d
its
a
bit
of
a
brute
but
a
tasty
one
drinkability
is
pretty
damn
good
for
the
size
and
style
of
these
beer
balanced
in
a
way
thats
deceptive
and
very
tasty
this
is
surely
something
i
would
search
out
again
drink
without
hesitation
and
want
to
have
on
hand
at
all
times
during
the
fall
and
winter
easily
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
ever
experienced
at
least
for
my
tastebuds
d
aging
would
rellt
help
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
nice
barleywine
but
just
a
little
too
hot
and
hoppy
with
aging
this
beer
would
mellow
out
quite
a
bit
this
sample
was
fresh
about
a
month
old
pours
dark
mahogany
with
a
silky
tan
head
nose
has
bitter
hops
fruity
malts
and
caramel
taste
also
has
lots
of
sweet
candy
malts
that
are
well
balanced
by
fruity
hops
big
creamy
body
has
a
crisp
carbonation
nice
resiny
hops
in
the
finish
good
stuffshould
age
quite
well
drinkability
the
heat
in
the
finish
was
distracting
but
i
dont
think
that
would
be
noticed
within
standard
serving
types
draft
or
bottle
pretty
nice
sipper
d
a
great
tasting
barleywine
the
hops
really
pack
a
punch
pours
a
hazy
dark
amber
to
brown
in
color
with
a
good
sized
creamy
light
tan
head
that
slowly
recedes
aroma
shows
some
ripe
berries
along
with
a
good
dose
of
citrusy
hoppiness
strong
grapefruit
some
caramel
in
the
aroma
as
well
taste
follows
and
is
dominated
by
a
big
hoppiness
up
front
lots
of
tangerine
and
citrus
notes
some
sweet
maltiness
and
berry
notes
come
in
mid
taste
but
are
mainly
a
quick
flash
before
the
citrusy
hops
kick
back
in
in
a
grapefruity
finish
that
mixes
with
a
little
toasted
bread
flavor
mouthfeel
is
outstanding
big
body
but
not
heavy
rather
nice
and
creamy
feel
mixes
very
nicely
with
the
hoppy
flavors
and
bitterness
in
the
finish
decent
hoppy
bite
at
the
finish
slightly
drying
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
a
very
good
hoppy
barleywine
extremely
drinkable
i
am
sure
the
malts
will
eventually
become
the
showcase
but
this
beer
drinks
incredibly
well
fresh
right
now
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
so
far
dfresh
like
this
one
its
a
dipa
put
some
age
on
it
and
it
turns
into
a
barleywine
while
i
like
it
more
fresh
i
did
a
side
by
side
with
an
aged
scratch
4
and
well
it
tastes
pretty
damn
good
too
either
way
hard
to
go
wrong
imho
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
troegs
has
ever
made
a
fine
concoction
of
hops
and
malt
hv
future
outlook
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
deviation
of
a
barleywine
that
i
will
be
happy
to
try
again
this
is
not
somthing
i
could
call
traditional
based
on
what
ive
tasted
in
other
american
barleywines
but
its
an
exceptional
take
on
the
style
and
very
enjoyable
drinkability
has
a
slite
cut
in
it
due
to
some
of
that
warming
a
little
more
sweetness
after
the
swallow
would
have
helped
to
mask
that
helping
this
be
a
real
easy
drinker
it
is
definatly
a
sipper
but
a
great
beer
too
d
id
say
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
barleywine
if
you
enjoy
fresh
bigfoot
this
will
be
right
up
your
alley
i
can
only
imagine
how
well
this
would
age
wow
spectacular
beer
one
of
the
best
straightup
barleywines
ive
ever
had
the
hops
just
reload
the
taste
into
a
different
stratosphere
grasping
for
a
reason
not
to
give
this
an
a
i
simply
cant
find
one
wow
a
good
beer
that
would
benefit
with
age
nice
stuff
but
eventually
the
resins
will
get
to
you
cutting
down
on
drinkability
drinkability
for
the
style
fantastic
absolutely
no
hint
of
the
9
3
to
be
found
though
this
one
does
have
a
little
bit
of
age
on
it
the
flavors
are
fantastic
the
appearance
very
nice
and
everything
else
solidly
solid
definitely
recommended

highly
recommended
especially
for

the

this
is
a

lasted
a

could
have
probably
drank
the
whole

for
the
most
part
until
the
aftertaste
would
drink
again
glad
to
have
a
few
in
my
cellar
to
experiment
with
recommended
big
bodied
noticeably
viscous
in
the
glass
a
very
nice
and
somewhat
unique
american
barleywine
one
is
reminded
perhaps
of
an
ris
storm
king
comes
to
mind
or
maybe
another
favorite
style
d
it
was
the
lowest
abv
barleywine
that
we
drank
and
the
alcohol
was
hidden
extremely
well
for
the
style
this
is
near
the
top
this
may
be
a
new
favorite
extremely
great
drinkability
astonishing
palate
great
mouthfeel
nothing
i
would
change
try
it
if
you
have
access
troegs
describes
this
beer
as
if
you
took
nugget
nectar
and
pushed
it
off
a
cliff
i
would
say
that
is
about
as
accurate
as
you
can
get
this
is
considered
an
american
style
barleywine
and
that
it
is
with
9
3
abv
its
not
a
beer
you
will
be
enjoying
all
afternoonevening
but
it
does
mask
the
alcohol
flavor
quite
well
the
beer
itself
is
a
light
mahogany
color
with
hops
hops
hops
in
the
nose
this
is
one
of
the
more
hoppy
barlywines
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
the
taste
is
complex
with
notes
of
vanilla
and
chocolate
as
well
as
balanced
bitterness
from
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
all
of
the
flavors
blending
smoothly
and
finishing
slightly
sweet
overall
this
is
definitely
a
beer
worth
checking
out
and
its
a
must
for
hop
heads
pours
a
solid
brown
with
a
nice
deep
maroon
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
smallish
tan
head
that
dissolves
down
to
a
fine
film
nose
is
strong
spicy
hops
fruity
subtle
malt
presence
flavor
is
similar
although
a
fair
bit
stronger
sugary
candy
with
a
spicy
fruit
hop
presence
up
front
a
touch
of
malt
in
there
but
this
is
a
hoppy
beer
definitely
more
dipa
than
barley
wine
in
my
opinion
body
is
fine
medium
appropriate
for
the
brew
nice
carbonation
overall
a
solid
beer
thats
good
but
not
quite
excellent
which
i
expect
from
troegss
bigger
beers
and
especially
a
barley
wine
what
an
awesome
barleywine
the
beer
pours
with
a
darker
brown
less
mohogany
and
ruby
than
most
leading
me
to
beleive
a
toasty
melanoidinrich
dopplebock
malt
profile
awaits
thick
foamstance
rises
from
the
glass
and
provides
a
mousselike
barrier
to
plow
through
on
my
way
to
the
first
few
sips
serious
malt
aromas
confirm
the
toasty
bready
hints
and
provide
dehydrated
fruits
of
cherries
berries
apples
figs
dates
and
raisons
but
these
all
take
a
secondary
role
to
the
malts
think
fruitcake
flavors
mirror
the
aromas
exactly
sweet
but
more
malty
keeps
the
beer
from
cloying
or
syrupy
the
esters
take
on
a
rumsoaked
taste
and
dont
interfere
with
the
rich
malt
flavors
and
textures
hopped
for
flavor
and
bitterness
they
provide
more
of
a
pine
resin
and
orange
zest
taste
very
bready
and
becomming
increasingly
dry
going
into
the
finish
this
beer
is
both
well
attenuated
and
creamyrich
the
malts
take
on
an
evaporative
nature
in
the
mouth
making
drinkability
a
breeze
hop
bitterness
accentuate
the
dryness
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
perhaps
a
bit
cleaner
than
the
bigfoots
and
old
crustacian
in
the
malts
and
esters
which
makes
this
beer
great
at
layering
flavors
and
keeping
confusion
at
bay
pours
a
slightly
hazy
caramel
brown
under
a
dark
tan
one
finger
head
that
fades
slowly
to
film
and
collar
leaving
some
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
lovely
combining
sweet
caramel
and
spicey
hops
in
a
very
strong
scent
that
invites
from
afar
the
mouth
is
very
prickly
and
quite
sticky
almost
to
the
point
of
being
syrupy
the
taste
is
marvellously
rich
with
equal
portions
chocolate
and
pine
sap
blending
across
the
tongue
and
lingering
long
after
the
swallow
powerfully
hopped
yet
nicely
balanced
the
strength
is
also
quite
evident
this
one
might
be
too
strong
to
finish
a
bomber
alone
but
globetrotterette
has
already
claimed
the
second
pour
for
her
own
as
she
does
not
normally
like
strong
or
hoppy
beers
that
is
high
praise
indeed
well
done
pours
a
shade
lighter
than
brown
with
deep
copperred
highlights
and
a
creamy
off
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
cap
right
after
i
poured
this
the
aroma
was
all
hops
resinous
and
floral
hops
after
a
few
minutes
the
hops
gave
way
to
slightly
sugary
caramel
malts
some
toffee
or
brown
sugar
in
there
as
well
taste
follows
the
aroma
malty
citrus
bite
up
front
caramel
and
toffee
peak
through
in
the
middle
followed
by
a
lingering
somewhat
dry
resinous
hop
finish
creamy
mouthfeel
thick
body
medium
carbonation
great
barleywine
quite
hop
forward
ala
bigfoot
i
wish
i
had
bought
2
of
these
cause
id
love
to
open
one
next
year
this
is
definitely
one
of
if
not
thee
best
american
barleywine
that
ive
had
i
love
the
duality
of
this
either
being
able
to
enjoy
it
has
a
huge
hop
bomb
fresh
or
putting
some
time
on
it
and
letting
the
complexity
of
the
malts
emerge
either
way
its
a
winner
a
good
barleywine
very
hoppy
which
personally
appeals
to
me
quite
rich
so
this
is
a
slow
sipper
poured
into
a
chalice
a
very
nice
golden
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
tan
head
with
a
nice
big
oil
slick
and
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
hops
slight
toffee
slight
spice
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
with
some
nice
hop
notes
toffeespice
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
glad
to
get
a
chance
to
try
it
thanks
brian
a
little
sweeter
than
other
barley
wines
i
have
recently
tried
including
sn
bigfoot
great
divide
old
ruffian
and
victory
old
horizontal
next
year
i
will
definitely
pick
up
more
than
one
bottle
i
was
unsure
about
whether
to
let
this
bottle
age
a
bit
or
drink
it
fresh
as
i
only
bought
a
single
bottle
so
after
about
a
month
and
a
half
to
two
months
i
gave
in
and
opened
what
i
found
was
a
sort
of
bigfootesque
barleywine
very
hoppy
and
very
sweet
the
pour
was
beautiful
much
darker
than
expected
a
deep
burgundy
very
red
smells
is
very
very
sweet
hop
aroma
but
the
smell
isnt
really
too
strong
if
smelled
from
snifter
you
have
to
smell
it
right
out
of
the
bottle
to
get
it
very
sweet
backbone
of
sugary
sweetness
the
flavor
is
like
a
dipa
with
a
more
potent
sweetness
very
citrusy
as
well
mouth
is
fairly
thick
almost
chewy
a
bit
syrupy
but
good
its
certainly
delicious
and
nice
to
sip
on
could
you
session
it
probably
not
but
its
definitely
great
i
certianly
wish
i
had
a
second
bottle
to
try
in
another
few
months
bombers
of
9
3
ill
take
one
but
i
think
thats
enough
solid
thick
slick
mouthfeel
lighter
on
the
carbonation
slightly
bitter
and
sour
aftertaste
alcohol
burn
is
noticeable
but
not
overwhelming
decent
brew
but
not
the
jog
down
memory
lane
i
was
hoping
for
this
one
was
way
past
prime
d
with
the
exception
of
the
abv
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
love
the
cross
between
ipa
and
barleywine
troegs
has
done
it
again
the
flying
mouflan
is
another
big
winner
from
troegs
damn
those
guys
make
great
beer
to
be
honest
if
youre
a
barleywine
fan
theres
very
little
here
thats
not
to
love
its
best
assets
are
its
great
hop
flavor
and
incredible
balance
it
doesnt
lean
too
far
in
one
direction
at
all
i
also
like
the
fact
that
the
dark
fruit
is
somewhat
restrained
at
times
that
can
be
a
turnoff
for
me
if
its
too
strong
troegs
got
it
just
right
with
this
one
this
is
great
beer
trust
me
go
find
a
few
bottles
youll
be
super
glad
that
you
did
if
you
are
a
fan
of
aging
barleywines
this
one
is
big
and
hot
right
now
grab
one
of
these
and
throw
it
in
your
cellar
for
a
year
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
awesome
it
has
a
killer
hop
nose
along
with
a
solid
burnt
toffee
aroma
it
has
a
nice
roasted
scent
with
some
excellent
caramel
notes
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
very
bitter
hop
bite
that
lends
itself
well
to
the
malt
base
however
the
chocolate
roasted
character
is
overpowered
with
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
im
not
completely
sold
on
the
grain
bill
but
the
hops
are
a
nice
touch
ill
be
back
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
chewy
bitter
with
hops
and
sweet
malt
that
feels
sweet
thanks
fellas
for
coming
through
in
a
pinch
after
these
couple
of
trades
i
need
to
keep
a
xmas
card
list
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
and
creamy
feel
that
makes
it
a
pleasure
to
drink
smells
of
hops
malt
and
slight
alcohol
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
it
is
fairly
bitter
but
it
is
thick
enough
and
sweet
enough
to
balance
it
out
there
is
a
bit
of
a
bitter
aftertaste
that
doesnt
quite
work
for
me
d
i
cant
thank
bill
enough
for
sending
me
this
very
nice
barleywine
from
troegs
i
just
wish
they
were
available
here
drinkability
so
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
a
kick
i
n
the
bucket
despite
the
high
number
its
just
so
smooth
and
so
balanced
could
drink
this
all
nite
such
a
great
hop
finish
yet
such
a
great
malty
sweetness
balance
and
flavor
are
both
great
on
this
great
beer
and
very
unique
beer
by
troegs
one
you
definitely
want
to
try
if
you
can
and
would
be
very
interesting
to
see
age
this
poured
a
hazy
dark
mahogany
with
a
bit
of
tan
head
it
smelled
like
strong
juicy
pineapple
with
some
mango
and
grape
and
milk
chocolate
it
tasted
like
a
beautiful
blend
of
pineapple
mango
and
grape
hops
with
some
milk
chocolate
and
sweet
caramel
it
was
fairly
thick
with
a
hint
of
carbonation
and
had
a
sweet
and
tart
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
very
clean
taste
that
was
super
flavorful
and
delicious
nice
body
too
and
very
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
was
noticeable
so
this
beer
might
mellow
out
even
more
and
improve
with
some
age
but
its
already
so
good
fresh
id
love
to
try
this
side
by
side
with
nugget
nectar
because
they
seem
have
a
lot
of
similar
flavor
elements
mouflan
just
takes
it
one
step
further
which
is
simply
magnificent
medium
bodied
with
lowmedium
carbonation
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
with
a
huge
stiff
light
tan
head
spotty
patterns
of
lacing
build
when
served
warmer
the
smell
has
an
aggressive
fragrant
piny
hop
and
grassy
character
cant
say
thats
to
style
but
youve
gotta
love
it
the
mouth
feel
is
tangy
yet
full
bodied
and
creamy
the
complexity
adds
to
the
drinkability
the
piny
grapefruit
hoppy
flavor
laced
with
chocolate
notes
is
original
and
intense
an
absolutely
wild
combo
the
9
3
abv
is
well
integrated
talk
about
nugget
nectar
pushed
over
the
edge
good
analogy
recommended
d
i
could
drink
this
reqularly
fresh
it
was
very
good
but
letting
it
age
would
be
outstanding
murky
brown
color
that
dosnt
do
much
to
impress
but
the
thick
head
and
sticky
lacing
promises
better
things
to
come
smell
of
caramel
alcohol
and
some
earthy
to
pine
hops
taste
is
sticky
sweet
up
front
followed
by
pine
hop
bitterness
that
holds
on
for
a
long
time
also
some
dark
plum
fruit
flavors
show
some
burn
from
the
high
abv
peaks
through
at
the
end
complex
big
full
flavored
sipper
nothing
at
all
about
this
one
is
understated
across
the
board
good
beer
but
something
is
preventing
me
from
saying
exceptional
not
sure
id
describe
this
as
a
barleywine
due
to
the
hoppy
character
lack
of
warming
sensation
not
bad
but
not
totally
sure
what
to
make
of
it
d
pretty
good
stuff
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
but
a
welcomed
treat
from
the
east
coast
d
definitly
a
tongue
grabbing
and
bitter
experience
though
seemed
a
little
one
dimensional
flavor
wise
while
it
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
overall
a
bomber
is
sure
to
suffice
semantics
aside
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
head
and
great
lacing
clearly
loaded
with
nugget
hops
i
know
this
because
of
the
vast
lakes
of
nugget
nectar
i
have
drunk
over
the
past
three
and
a
half
months
lots
of
dark
malt
too
results
in
a
sweet
somewhat
grapfruity
bouquet
that
tastes
exactly
like
it
smells
gives
a
nice
hop
fix
with
sweet
dark
fruit
and
only
a
small
bite
betraying
the
9
3
abv
despite
which
it
goes
down
way
too
easy
d
its
not
extremely
high
to
me
but
that
should
do
no
discouragement
i
like
the
fresh
but
the
latter
version
should
be
a
doozy
recommended
either
way
murky
brown
with
a
bit
of
a
reddish
hue
a
thin
beige
cap
of
fine
bubbles
formed
slowly
during
the
pour
spotty
lacing
decent
head
retention
ah
classic
american
barleywine
aroma
lots
of
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
healthy
dose
of
pine
and
grapefruit
fairly
heavy
on
the
citrus
rind
and
pith
without
being
too
sharp
some
tangerine
too
bitterness
was
balanced
and
really
changed
from
start
to
finish
up
front
it
was
in
the
background
allowing
the
sweet
malts
and
caramel
dominate
midpalate
was
where
the
hop
flavour
started
to
happen
again
with
the
grapefruit
and
a
bit
of
pine
lots
of
pith
bitterness
grew
towards
the
end
and
really
lingered
along
with
a
mixed
fruit
basket
of
citrus
goodness
caramel
and
toffee
were
still
present
at
this
point
but
had
definitely
taken
a
back
seat
to
the
hops
full
bodied
without
being
overly
heavy
carbonation
was
on
the
lower
side
making
it
fairly
smooth
some
alcohol
flavour
and
warmth
in
the
finish
pretty
much
exactly
what
i
expect
from
a
solid
barleywine
lots
of
malt
lots
of
hops
a
bit
aggressive
but
still
nice
and
smooth
drinkability
meh
not
my
favorite
beer
from
troegs
thats
for
sure
it
tastes
alright
but
the
balance
is
a
bit
too
far
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
preference
but
i
can
see
why
a
lot
of
other
people
may
like
it
md
full
bodied
with
a
very
heavy
feel
in
the
mouth
a
little
too
high
on
the
carbonation
but
not
to
the
point
that
it
really
distracts
from
the
beer
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
overwhelming
drinkability
low
to
moderate
at
best
it
is
actually
challenging
to
drink
thanks
to
the
boldness
of
the
flavors
and
the
heat
of
the
alcohol
d
overall
a
bit
too
malty
and
thick
for
me
aroma
is
sweet
hoppy
and
notes
of
alcohol
taste
starts
with
the
same
sweetness
citrusy
fruitiness
coupled
with
pine
hops
character
light
numbing
to
close
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
way
easy
could
drink
too
much
of
this
for
sure
d
theres
no
mistaking
this
for
anything
but
what
it
is
american
barleywine
baby
dry
bitter
and
slightly
raw
but
the
alcohol
is
surprisingly
well
hidden
this
is
really
a
great
beer
and
one
that
i
probably
would
like
to
have
every
now
and
again
one
a
night
though
i
wouldnt
want
to
get
sick
of
it
because
its
pretty
unique
and
the
alcohol
content
is
deceiving
its
well
priced
at
7
at
least
in
new
york
and
it
keeps
up
with
troegs
other
fine
offerings
medium
carbonation
and
almost
a
little
aggressive
on
the
tongue
at
first
but
smooth
and
dry
in
the
finish
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
this
is
quite
tasty
drinkability
a
wonderful
brew
that
fans
of
barleywines
and
dipas
need
to
find
i
have
another
bottle
thankfully
that
id
like
to
age
for
about
46
months
thinking
some
chocolate
might
come
in
since
they
do
say
something
about
it
on
the
label
that
curls
around
the
bottleneck
get
it
if
you
can
find
it
overall
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
the
best
versions
that
ive
had
actually
highly
recommended
im
interested
to
see
how
this
one
ages
drinkability
never
had
a
brew
so
hop
forward
with
such
little
bitterness
and
big
fruitiness
not
the
biggest
barleywine
fan
of
all
time
but
i
really
do
love
this
beer
its
dripping
with
hoppy
goodness
thanks
much
adam
thanks
for
reading
this
poured
maroon
with
a
frothy
beige
head
the
aroma
is
similar
to
nugget
nectar
but
more
bitter
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
taste
the
doughy
breadlike
malt
flavor
is
tasty
this
brew
is
thicker
than
nugget
nectar
and
very
barleywineish
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
oily
and
smooth
overall
its
not
as
flavorful
as
the
nugget
nectar
maybe
its
the
extra
but
not
overdone
for
a
barleywine
alcohol
its
not
as
balanced
as
the
other
troegs
beers
but
its
not
supposed
to
be
its
an
awesome
offering
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
this
up
if
you
see
it
d
very
drinkable
reminded
me
of
druid
fluid
on
cask
which
is
a
jewel
very
nicely
done
glad
to
see
they
are
willing
to
bring
some
scratch
beers
back
a
big
brother
to
nugget
nectar
its
one
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
american
barleywine
certainly
the
quality
you
would
expect
from
troegs
pours
ruby
brown
in
color
with
a
nice
inch
of
frothy
off
white
head
looks
good
smells
even
better
a
nice
blast
of
hops
to
start
off
with
then
a
nice
rush
of
roasted
malts
and
some
spice
taste
is
even
better
than
the
smell
im
really
digging
this
beer
plenty
of
hops
in
the
flavor
perfect
full
and
robust
in
the
mouthfeel
you
have
to
refrain
from
crushing
this
beer
it
is
really
that
drinkable
theres
no
sign
of
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
what
some
age
would
do
to
this
beer
but
i
think
the
fresh
hop
presence
is
what
makes
this
beer
what
it
is
now
very
good
beer
along
with
the
mad
elf
this
is
easily
my
favorite
offering
from
troegs
pours
dark
plummy
amber
murky
under
a
dak
tan
head
that
leaves
splotches
of
lace
nose
is
of
ripe
fruit
musty
hop
oils
and
then
some
sweet
maple
strong
and
tasty
brew
bold
strokes
of
resiny
hops
and
repectable
layers
of
maple
malts
some
glimmers
of
boozy
alcohol
poke
their
heads
up
but
the
smoothness
and
continuing
melange
of
hopsmalts
follow
through
to
make
the
finish
line
nice
offering
thats
well
worth
a
try
suprisingly
not
as
heavy
as
i
would
have
expected
it
to
be
pretty
big
and
dark
beer
but
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
leaves
a
great
after
taste
deffinatly
my
favorite
beer
brewed
from
the
troegs
brothers
to
date
overall
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
with
great
potential
for
ageing
wish
i
had
more
a
big
thanks
to
aaron
for
this
treat
i
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bomber
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
deep
caramel
with
a
2
finger
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
citrus
with
a
pineapple
chaser
this
is
a
real
hop
bomb
lots
of
sweet
pine
and
citrus
notes
and
a
real
sticky
mouthfeel
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
but
feels
fuller
the
brew
is
a
sipper
this
one
is
better
than
i
expected

pours
hazy
opaque
reddish
with
a
fluffy
head
that
falls
to
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
hugely
hoppy
sweet
floral
a
little
pine
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
strongly
hoppy
floral
with
a
little
pine
sting
the
malt
is
sweet
and
rich
and
clean
a
little
bready
with
a
nice
amber
ale
kick
it
almost
has
a
cherrylike
quality
with
a
bit
of
toffee
and
dark
caramel
the
bitterness
delivers
low
and
in
the
back
of
the
throat
and
doesnt
linger
too
long
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
clingy
with
a
little
zip
of
carbonation
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beers
body
is
pleasantly
full
the
malt
back
bone
is
round
and
big
it
makes
me
feel
like
mixalot
i
like
em
round
and
big
the
carbonation
is
low
and
this
might
be
an
issue
for
some
but
i
like
it
with
this
beer
the
drinkability
is
crazy
i
had
problems
putting
this
beer
down
i
am
honestly
distressed
how
quickly
i
finished
the
bomber
troegs
you
should
really
consider
making
this
beer
seasonally
at
the
least
thank
you
tastes
mildly
sweet
lots
of
citrus
and
pine
hops
very
interesting
barleywine
very
complex
and
drinkable
certainly
they
are
accurate
this
is
nugget
nectar
concentrate
i
like
rather
aggressive
barleywine
loaded
with
grapefruit
from
the
hops
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
from
the
large
amounts
of
malts
probably
could
afford
to
sit
a
bit
although
i
prefer
these
beers
fresh
recommended
pours
a
solid
brown
color
with
a
frothy
tan
head
that
settles
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
of
juicy
orange
and
grapefruit
hops
and
a
honey
like
sweet
syrup
grapefruit
hop
flavor
starts
things
off
flowing
into
a
rindyresiny
bitter
hop
a
noticable
malt
backbone
sits
shotgun
but
helps
balance
out
the
bitter
hop
a
toasted
character
to
the
malt
with
honey
and
a
slight
raisin
flavor
the
brew
has
a
full
body
with
enough
carbonation
to
avoid
being
slick
or
syrupy
which
is
preferable
to
me
seems
to
have
more
a
malt
presence
than
most
barleywines
closer
to
an
american
strong
ale
finishes
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
a
nice
malty
hoppy
barleywine
good
mixture
of
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
for
a
barleywine
style
ale
it
goes
above
and
beyond
the
norm
overall
pretty
good
i
was
expecting
more
malty
sweetness
based
on
the
smell
ill
let
my
other
bottle
age
a
few
months
to
see
if
the
bitter
flavors
subside
oelergud
d
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
that
i
feared
i
would
never
try
fresh
again
a
stunningly
great
beer
d
not
a
huge
barleywine
but
still
definitely
a
sipper
i
really
like
the
hops
profile
in
this
but
i
think
a
year
or
so
will
do
the
malt
backbone
some
good
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
murky
reddish
amber
color
and
formed
a
huge
light
tan
foamy
head
an
aroma
of
malt
hops
and
hint
of
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
malt
hops
caramel
and
a
hint
of
plum
the
body
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
bittersweet
with
a
slight
bit
of
astringency

at
palmers
in
columbus
the
bottle
says
this
ale
is
like
pushing
our
nugget
nectar
off
the
side
of
a
cliff
tastes
like
hops
dipped
in
candied
sugar
and
rolled
in
dark
chocolate
nibs
i
like
the
sound
of
this
the
beer
is
very
dark
as
compared
with
nugget
nectar
hazy
auburn
dark
orangebrown
with
thick
creamy
tan
foam
actually
it
looks
a
lot
like
aventinus
but
the
aroma
and
taste
are
completely
different
the
aroma
is
hoppy
as
hell
it
does
indeed
smell
like
a
very
strong
version
of
nugget
nectar
the
taste
is
less
appealing
but
still
good
very
sweet
as
if
candi
was
added
instead
of
more
hops
i
guess
this
makes
it
more
barleywiney
as
it
adds
fermentables
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
dipa
style
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
very
coating
i
have
another
which
will
probably
cellar
for
1
year
to
see
how
the
malt
develops
out
as
the
hops
mellow
but
maybe
ill
trade
it
before
it
gets
that
far
d
perhaps
the
line
is
erased
like
a
pink
rubber
eraser
on
graphite
between
strong
ipaiipa
and
american
barleywine
but
who
cares
about
style
right
not
troegs
thank
god
for
good
reasonif
it
tastes
good
brew
it
an
all
around
world
class
beer
but
not
as
an
everyday
beer
a
beer
to
savor
and
sip
but
it
is
well
worth
the
attention
a
phenomenal
tasting
beer
i
am
so
glad
this
made
it
into
the
rotation
this
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
such
a
big
beer
d
its
good
and
pleasant
definately
like
it
but
didnt
blow
me
away
i
do
have
a
slight
cold
however
i
enjoyed
and
would
drink
again
but
would
share
a
22
next
time
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
an
interesting
barleywine
but
a
great
beer
reminds
me
of
an
imperial
nugget
nectar
as
it
has
similar
qualities
after
reading
reviews
on
it
before
even
opening
it
i
only
put
it
in
the
fridge
for
a
little
bit
better
warm
this
beer
is
deffinatly
one
of
the
better
balanced
barleywines
ive
ever
had
i
like
the
little
spicey
kindy
malt
i
get
from
it
with
age
i
think
the
malt
character
will
get
alot
more
complexthe
choclate
nibs
i
think
must
have
given
it
the
different
choclate
malt
im
tasting
i
wanna
look
into
choclate
nibs
i
used
powder
coco
once
didnt
effect
it
much
i
gave
it
aa
drinkin
the
22
oz
bottle
made
me
feel
warm
and
fuzzy
good
stuff
i
can
deffinatly
taste
the
nugget
warrior
tommahawk
combo
or
maybe
one
left
out
overall
im
never
dissapointed
with
any
troegs
product
d
reminds
me
of
nugget
nectar
with
more
of
a
malt
background
i
love
super
hoppy
beers
but
the
addition
of
malts
and
whatever
to
change
this
nn
like
beer
into
a
barleywine
lowers
the
drinkability
so
much
one
of
my
favorite
examples
of
the
style
but
i
just
dont
dig
it
that
much
d
the
finish
and
balance
makes
this
a
dangerously
drinkable
and
resippable
beer
share
one
or
lock
yourself
in
your
room
with
this
one
it
is
very
nice
to
see
some
of
troegs
bigger
beers
arrive
here
this
was
bought
at
colonial
spirits
in
acton
mass
color
on
this
beer
is
rosy
with
not
too
much
in
the
way
of
heading
smell
is
very
hoppy
with
some
notes
of
chocolate
and
candy
sugar
as
indicated
by
the
label
buried
beneath
the
hop
profile
the
hops
have
a
very
nice
spicy
aroma
to
them
flavor
is
really
hoppy
but
with
a
nice
underlying
element
of
fruit
and
tobacco
it
ends
on
a
very
dry
bitter
note
body
is
medium
which
is
cool
considering
all
the
flavor
coming
out
of
this
brew
as
tasty
as
this
is
the
alcohol
can
be
felt
easily
with
this
beer
i
would
recommend
sharing
this
one
with
a
friend
or
two
troegs
hit
a
home
run
with
me
on
this
beer
i
love
the
fact
that
it
is
sort
of
a
difficult
to
classify
beer
there
are
aspects
of
barleywine
and
dipa
here
and
it
truly
manages
to
tread
right
in
the
middle
of
the
two
i
cannot
say
enough
positive
things
about
this
beer
if
you
see
it
definitely
get
some
cheers
d
this
one
is
flying
right
now
and
could
use
a
lower
altitude
so
im
going
to
store
a
bottle
for
two
years
and
see
what
flies
either
way
its
great
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
for
hopheads
or
bwine
lovers
as
this
one
has
a
nice
mix
of
both
i
guess
i
did
not
know
what
i
was
getting
into
but
it
was
a
beautiful
ride
d
one
bomber
of
this
potent
9
brew
is
sufficient
welcome
back
old
friend
poured
about
half
of
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
about
a
half
inch
white
head
went
away
quickly
nice

redbrown
in
color
hoppy
aroma
accented
with
sweetness
my
first
sip
i
was
not
very
impressed
as
i
let
the
beer
warm
it
progressively
got
better
it
is
litterly
like
taking
nugget
nectar
and
mad
elf
and
putting
them
into
one
glass
without
the
honey
and
cherries
i
must
say
i
am
not
big
on
barleywines
but
this
is
exceptional
the
mouthful
is
smooth
light
on
acid
and
carbonation
i
said
it
before
and
ill
say
it
again
the
troegs
brothers
dont
fuck
around
good
job
boys
i
grabbed
another
bottle
and
put
it
away
for
a
winter
night
next
year
it
should
age
well
very
well
notes
very
impressed
with
this
new
one
albeit
actually
being
just
a
changed
name
from
troegs
they
say
it
pushed
nn
off
a
cliff
not
too
sure
on
the
wording
but
overall
its
pretty
awesome
while
maybe
being
classified
as
a
hop
bomb

its

to
see
another
great
offering
from
troegs
interesting
experiment
from
troegs
it
walks
the
line
between
an

and
a
barleywine
quite
well
however
its
not
a
path
i
would
want
to
walk
often
a
nice
departure
though

also
notes
coca
nibs
in
this
one
this
was
one
taste
i
couldnt
find
in
it
maybe
some
time
to
age
will
bring
this
out
pours
reddish
brown
with
offwhite

that
leaves

that
give
off

from

this
is
a

nightcap
that
could
go
well
with
flan
but
other
than
that
a
bit
too
syrupy

for
my
liking

makes

im
aging
another
bottle
for
a
year
since
this
beer
is
supposed
to
transform
as
it
ages
and
the
hops
mellow
out
ill
update
the
review
then
d
quite
drinkable
while
i
prefer
to
drink
just
one
of
these
slowly
i
could
definitely
see
drinking
more
than
just
one
d
this
straddles
the
line
between
american
barleywine
and
dipa
scratch
4
is
the
beer
that
really
got
me
into
the
barleywine
style
so
needless
to
say
it
was
indeed
a
pleasure
to
experience
this
phenomenal
brew
again
i
am
glad
i
purchased
a
whole
case
of
this
aside
from
nugget
nectar
this
is
probably
the
best
brew
troegs
has
ever
concocted
simply
put
this
is
an
amazing
beer
well
i
remember
this
one
and
i
remember
not
being
a
big
fan
not
incredibly
well
balanced
bitterness
that
didnt
correspond
with
the
nose
of
a
hop
characteristic
that
left
an
odd
cloying
sweet
bitterness
behind
with
a
little
rubbing
alcohol
just
not
much
i
could
enjoy
with
this
one
nice
barley
wine
alittle
too
much
citrus
and
pineapple
for
me
overall
average
at
best
can
dated
2513
never
had
a
fresh
one
ive
got
to
say
i
love
these
cans
theyre
the
perfect
serving
size
for
the
style
great
for
camping
this
is
very
hot
fresh
and
cellaring
in
cans
isnt
practical
fantastic
smell
great
color
and
taste
serving
type
can
o
very
tasty
this
was
expensive
treat
but
i
did
enjoy
it
a
solid
release
but
not
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
tasted
a
solid
sit
by
the
fireplace
and
watch
the
snow
fall
beer
overall
this
is
a
brilliant
fantastic
barleywine
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
it
is
like
with
some
more
age
on
it
barleywine
fans
should
really
like
this
this
poured
a
hazed
honey
orange
with
golden
hues
and
a
honey
brown
tint
lovely
with
a
fat
enough
head
of

that
fell
off
and
left

on

the
taste
is
sumptuous
its
sweet
but
not
cloying
it
has
grapefruit
that
is
tart
and
pithy
and
has
the
peel
the
hops
are
leafy
and
wide
the
soft
bread
and
brown
sugar
all
come
together
for
a
malt
that
is
sweet
and
delectable
with
a
bit
of
sitckiness
to
it
earthiness
gives
way
in
this
to
a
firm
herbal
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
that
grazes
the
back
palate
the
finish
is
dry
and
there
is
an
ample
bitter
to
leave
you
with
a
bit
of
resiny
coating
on
the
mouth
and
time
to
taste
all
those
tremendous
flavors
again
while
a
bit
of
spice
lingers
at
the
back
palate
great
packaging
like
what
the
english
would
call
a
nip
from
the
8
4
oz
can
purchased
in
the
fourpack
purchased
at
bottleworks
in
seattle
from
a
tiny
little
can
this
barley
wine
is
a
hazy
chestnut
color
with
a
thin
head
it
is
very
dry
with
a
lot
of
citrusy
and
resiny
hops
perfume
fruit
ripe
prach
and
orange
alcoholic
scents
dominate
the
beer
the
taste
has
malt
and
sugar
flavors
heavy
bitterness
full
and
rich
mouthfeel
pours
a
thick
cloudy
amber
with
a
thick
1
white
head
that
dies
down
to
light
foam
with
a
clinging
foam
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
of
hops
and
caramel
dates
plums
and
dark
fruit
and
spicy
hop
notes
taste
is
caramel
malts
up
front
mild
bittering
hops
on
the
middle
and
back
with
the
caramel
brown
sugar
and
a
dash
of
cinnamon
toast
great
mouthfeel
richly
carbonated
and
buttery
thus
making
for
a
decadent
barley
wine
reminds
me
somewhat
of
a
more
caramel
version
sierra
nevadas
big
foot
very
very
nice
boom
indeed
forget
the
little
cute
can
it
comes
in
this
one
hits
full
on
from
the
getgo
with
alcohol
burn
aroma
and
taste
give
away
to
high
abv
faint
malt
backbone
lies
somewhere
in
the
mix
but
an
overall
smooth
and
slightly
sweet
experience
nice
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
not
sure
whats
up
with
the
whacky
can
size
would
have
enjoyed
a
12
oz
but
o
wow
8
4
oz
is
an
absolute
perfect
size
for
this
beer
i
mean
cause
its
so
boozy
and
hard
to
drink
i
dont
know
how
well
this
would
age
it
seems
like
ill
have
to
give
it
another
chance
fresh
and
thats
a
shame
because
even
the
hoppiest
muricanstyle
barleywine
can
age
well
right
now
its
not
horrible
just
hard
work
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
less
complex
than
hoped
for
a
style
begging
for
complexity
o
not
an
awesome
barleywine
but
one
that
delivers
what
its
supposed
to
o
will
buy
more
esp
at
a
low
price
of
5
a
4
pk
o
its
good
the
more
you
drink
it
the
more
you
like
it
im
actually
more
familiar
with
aged
barleywines
so
this
was
hard
to
rate
at
first
tiny
little
unassuming
cans
can
sometimes
kick
your
butt
and
this
is
definitely
one
of
those
unsuspecting
all
the
way
its
simple
in
nose
moderately
hopped
with
a
molasses
undertone
but
smelling
not
an
eyelash
above
7
5
never
letting
on
to
its
real
magnitude
the
head
too
im
not
used
to
such
big
ones
in
barleywines
so
im
fooled
by
this
some
lightness
to
the
color
and
enough
bubbles
to
cut
the
viscosity
its
just
hard
to
identify
as
a
super
strong
ale
flavor
is
balanced
between
thick
and
sweet
barley
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
roast
spectrum
and
hops
which
have
a
citrusy
flavor
but
not
enough
acid
or
bitterness
to
rise
above
the
grain
lovely
stuff
one
can
is
plenty
and
im
glad
its
not
bigger
but
a
really
solid
as
well
as
interesting
take
on
barleywine
constantly
evolving
arent
they
the
booze
is
a
bit
more
notable
in
the
taste
but
overall
it
is
still
a
bold
barley
and
sweet
character
with
little
in
the
way
of
hop
bitterness
these
8
oz
cans
seem
to
be
pointless
though
o
great
take
on
a
barleywine
this
definatly
stands
out
to
me
i
love
the
west
coast
hop
take
on
a
malt
bomb
style
the
booze
is
definatly
present
i
wonder
how
it
would
age
in
the
can
im
gonna
hang
on
to
a
few
to
see
how
that
goes
will
definatly
buy
again
cheers
o
quite
hopforward
and
somewhat
unbalanced
for
a
barleywine
the
components
of
the
nose
dont
really
compliment
each
other
but
instead
present
a
hodgepodge
that
begs
to
be
sorted
out
i
like
to
enjoy
the
nose
of
a
big
beer
apart
from
its
taste
but
i
really
couldnt
do
that
with
this
beer
too
much
conflict
this
isnt
a
barley
wine
i
could
recommend
unless
someone
is
specifically
looking
for
a
pretty
bitter
iipa
barleywine
mashup
o
solid
american
barleywine
with
a
good
hop
profile
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
liked
the
slim
can
for
a
beer
with
an
abv
this
big
big
thanks
to
beer
geeks
at
cbc
braintree
for
the
recommendation
i
have
only
had
one
or
two
barley
wines
before
this
so
i
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
this
beer
is
great
i
dont
know
if
this
is
a
true
rep
of
the
style
but
this
is
great
beer
good
balance
between
malts
and
hops
and
really
drinkable
could
have
warmed
a
bit
as
i
drank
it
some
of
the
grainy
flavors
were
more
present
and
the
hop
flavors
were
also
more
accentuated
i
get
a
malty
sweetness
balanced
by
a
slight
bitterness
and
some
orange
notes
candied
sweet
with
a
long
finish
solid
if
not
spectacular
final
thoughts
so
not
quite
the
big
beer
that
i
was
expecting
due
to
the
lessthanrobust
taste
and
tepid
feel
but
still
a
good
beer
would
i
drink
it
again
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
barleywine
o
it
isnt
too
bad
but
at
about
11
bucks
for
4
8oz
cans
you
are
way
better
suited
with
something
else
for
your
money
3

overall
a
very
enjoyable
barleywine
a
good
balance
of
malt
sweetness
and
bitter

sweet
fruit
furniture
cleaner
caramels
butterscotch
candies
the
flavor
is
ok
some
metallic
notes
noticeable
alcohol
throughout
a
bold
beer
a
bit
aggressive
and
slightly
harsh
on
the
palate
not
as
bad
as
i
made
it
sound
middle
of
the
road
overall
nice
american
barleywine
big
citrus
notes
pretty
big
alcohol
presence
im
interested
to
see
how
both
will
mellow
as
it
ages
happyhulainthecooladay
overall
this
is
how
american
barleywine
should
be
big
lots
of
barley
bitter
hops
and
some
boozy
tingle
reminds
me
a
lot
of
old
guardian
from
stone
which
is
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
highly
recommended
o
definitely
an
americastyle
barelywine
in
my
experience
akin
to
a
double
ipa
but
with
a
higher
abv
its
hoppy
tropical
in
taste
and
smell
has
a
pretty
good
mouthfeel
and
its
delicious
overall
not
really
a
big
fan
of
this
barleywine
the
feel
was
a
bit
off
and
while
a
barleywine
is
expected
to
be
on
the
boozey
side
this
one
had
a
bit
too
much
of
a
astringent
and
hot
boozy
flavors
to
be
very
enjoyable
not
one
i
will
go
to
again
o
some
nice
sweet
malty
notes
have
begin
to
kick
in
but
other
than
that
this
ones
pretty
average
the
booze
is
not
hidden
at
all
and
actually
burns
going
down
at
times
overall
ill
have
to
salt
away
a
can
or
two
for
an
aged
sampling
but
these
are
pretty
decent
as
is
that
said
the
abv
is
not
hidden
at
all
and
belies
a
potent
little
kicker
of
a
can
overall
its
good
considering
of
what
it
is
i
personally
after
spending
a
chunk
of
money
here
can
think
of
better
choices
its
still
worth
your
time
split
the
four
pack
with
a
friend
salud
not
a
great
barleywine
but
not
undrinkable
o
appearance
and
aroma
had
me
filled
with
high
hopes
even
the
first
sip
showed
good
promise
half
way
thru
the
first
sip
things
changed
a
bit
the
hops
took
on
a
medicinal
quality
in
its
bitterness
that
took
away
many
of
the
fine
points
in
the
flavor
of
this
beer
the
mediciney
nature
continued
through
the
swallow
and
lingered
long
on
each
sip
i
love
a
good
and
hoppy
barleywine
and
i
thought
this
had
lots
of
promise
overall
not
bad
but
had
much
more
potential
i
could
drink
this
again
but
probably
wont
just
doesnt
live
up
to
other
easily
obtainable
hoppy
american
barleywines
the
booze
hits
first
not
a
burn
but
an
immediate
warmth
and
presence
hopes
are
strong
like
they
were
in
the
smell
but
the
malt
is
really
there
in
force
as
well
some
dark
candied
sweetness
some
tart
flavors
too
slightly
sour
grape
or
dates
feels
like
one
big
blanket
at
first
before
individual
parts
come
out
to
identify
seems
to
go
down
very
easily
for
me
feels
rich
but
not
super
thick
smooth
overall
hop
bitterness
shows
but
the
malt
and
body
really
keep
it
down
on
the
whole
slight
chocolate
note
in
the
aftertaste
not
really
sweet
though
some
earthiness
to
it
grainy
the
tart
fruit
really
comes
out
if
you
hold
this
one
for
a
bit
a
nice
sipper
dont
feel
the
abv
too
strongly
to
this
point
seems
like
this
could
be
a
big
malty
ipa
aged
on
oak
or
something
similar
without
that
flavor
being
dominant
would
be
interested
to
find
a
food
pairing
for
this
could
make
for
good
after
dinner
sharing
as
well
really
like
the
flavor
as
this
has
warmed
in
the
glass
i
didnt
quite
know
how
this
one
would
go
but
it
definitely
did
appeal
to
me
21a
did
a
nice
turn
here
total
3450
overall
it
is
ok
not
so
easy
to
drink
but
not
bad
either
you
can
feel
and
taste
the
booze
but
there
are
enough
flavors
to
make
this
tolerable
above
average
but
just
a
notch
or
two
a
decent
strong
ale
with
a
very
high
hop
flavor
the
hops
hide
basically
anything
else
in
the
flavor
the
alcohol
is
very
noticeable
in
this
one
too
not
going
to
be
for
everyone
even
barleywine
fans
overall
a
very
solid
effort
i
havent
had
many
others
from
21st
amendment
but
im
pretty
happy
with
this
one
overall
its
ok
but
missed
the
mark
for
me
with
limited
complexity
too
boozy
sticky
but
hard
to
distinguish
flavor
profile
medium
bodied
overall
very
malty
barleywine
with
strong
alcohol
notes
gets
better
as
it
warms
poured
into
stemware
deep
golden
red
delicate
head
fades
quickly
leaving
wet
laces
carmelly
malt
berry
aroma
thick
body
tingly
carbonation
rich
maltiness
dominates
not
too
sweet
not
too
toasty
alchohol
slowly
builds
in
the
finish
overall
a
solid
barleywine
would
definitely
revisit
o
an
enjoyable
barleywine
overall
nicely
hoppy
without
being
too
bitter
or
sweet
its
body
is
the
weakest
aspect
glad
i
got
to
try
a
can
of
this
one
definitely
dont
think
i
wouldve
liked
an
entire
4pack
overall
maybe
not
the
best
bwine
ive
tasted
but
love
the
citrus
dominant
flavours
works
very
well
on
this
summer
evening
a
little
hot
although
that
could
be
expected
for
a
fresh
barleywine
room
for
improvement
in
the
flavors
too
overall
a
good
choice
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
of
an
expansive
feel
but
overall
i
liked
it
poured
into
an
elysian
snifter
pours
a
hazy
orange
amber
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
into
patchy
foam
and
a
ring
around
the
glass
with
light
lacing
mild
aroma
of
orange
and
tangerine
citrus
ethanol
and
faint
sweet
malt
almost
smells
more
like
a
tincture
of
fruit
than
an
ale
flavor
of
citrus
hops
orange
faint
dark
and
light
stone
fruit
mild
malt
somewhat
astringent
finish
medium
bodied
an
odd
take
on
the
american
barleywine
style
that
leans
more
towards
a
dry
double
ipa
with
less
dark
fresh
and
dried
fruit
than
generally
encountered
in
a
barleywine
the
malt
body
seems
thin
for
the
style
and
abv
alcohol
is
less
dominant
in
the
taste
than
aroma
but
is
still
strong
the
bitter
orange
flavor
particularly
in
the
finish
is
intriguing
but
id
like
to
see
some
more
malt
support
for
the
fruit
and
hops
here
worth
a
try
im
going
to
cellar
a
few
to
see
what
happens
over
time
its
a
bit
too
hot
and
unbalanced
right
now
good
barleywine
i
like
the
8
oz
can
for
an
11
50
abv
beer
nice
to
drink
a
fresh
hoppy
barleywine
without
any
harsh
alcohol
accompanyment
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
the
boozy
flavor
may
be
offputting
for
some
but
there
is
great
complexity
in
this
beer
that
should
not
be
overlooked
o
not
a
bad
barleywine
not
a
great
one
either
but
for
the
price
its
still
a
solid
buy
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
the
alcohol
heat
and
the
bit
of
roughness
in
the
finish
impact
drinkability
for
me
worth
a
try
though
if
you
like
the
style
o
decent
barley
wine
needs
to
age
more
im
thinking
they
dont
age
as
well
in
cans
for
some
reason
o
nose
and
flavor
are
too
delicate
for
a
barley
overall
a
solid
and
enjoyable
american
style
barleywine
nice
combo
of
sticky
sweet
and
harsh
hops
very
well
balanced
certainly
one
i
would
pick
up
again
if
i
wanted
this
style
a
very
solid
barleywine
from
21st
8
4
oz
can
pored
into
a
tulip
poured
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
fingers
worth
of
head
smells
of
loads
of
west
coast
hops
resiny
citrus
lemon
zest
orange
peel
then
it
shows
its
barleywine
roots
with
loads
of
fig
cherry
raisin
toffee
and
caramel
mouthfell
was
mediumheavy
with
a
little
bit
of
booziness
overall
a
great
bw
from
21st
amendment
although
id
like
t
see
it
in
regular
sized
cans
but
besides
that
what
is
in
the
can
is
something
id
definetly
buy
again
overall
def
worth
a
try
in
my
book
because
it
is
unique
compared
to
most
barley
wines
out
there
i
think
this
one
would
improve
with
about
a
years
worth
of
cellaring
to
hopefully
mellow
out
that
alcogol
bightbut
thats
just
what
i
feel
itd
take
to
get
the
beer
to
where
id
personally
like
it
to
be
the
only
issue
with
that
is
thee
ol
hop
fade
which
may
be
an
oxymoron
since
that
hop
presence
is
something
that
was
mentioned
on
the
packaging
as
intentional
so
some
of
you
hop
heads
out
there
will
probably
ilke
this
one
right
where
its
at
off
the
shelves
o
this
is
a
pretty
runofthemill
american
barleywine
honestly
the
style
is
getting
a
little
boring
with
so
many
similar
iterations
o
overall
malty
good
rate
of
hop
ibus
caramelized
toasted
grains
the
8
4oz
can
seems
like
a
perfect
serving
size
while
some
breweries
that
try
to
overload
it
into
a
bomber
a
can
was
3
which
was
not
factored
into
my
overall
review
but
something
to
consider
for
those
looking
to
try
a
worthy
buy
this
is
the
perfect
serving
size
for
an
american
barleywine
21st
amendment
makes
great
beers
and
this
one
is
a
testament
to
their
creative
packaging
by
placing
it
in
an
8
4
ounce
can
nice
appearance
and
inviting
nose
great
taste
with
a
little
kick
so
enjoy
two
if
youre
up
for
it
d
this
was
an
ok
brew
but
the
scent
and
taste
werent
that
great
the
body
was
good
but
the
finish
was
harsh
so
it
wasnt
that
easy
to
drink
not
recommended
very
surprised
and
very
impressed
with
this
barleywine
very
drinkable
for
its
abv
while
not
as
complex
or
smooth
as
insanity
its
still
quite
enjoyable
lots
of
floral
flavors
and
hints
of
spiciness
fair
amount
of
hopiness
great
look
and
solid
feel
very
glad
i
tried
this
overall
pretty
solid
beer
might
have
to
age
the
3
other
cans
from
the
4
pack
to
mellow
out
the

for
a
pretty
fresh

ibu

abv
barleywine
this
just
doesnt
really
pack
much
of
a
punch
nothing
super
remarkable
about
this
one
o
it
is
a
good
bw
but
it
comes
in
a
weird
can
size
that
only
has
4
in
the
pack
however
it
packs
quite
a
punch
for
its
size
and
a
12
oz
bottle
might
have
been
a
bit
much
i
was
recommended
it
by
my
local
shop
after
i
came
in
asking
for
something
similar
to
bigfoot
its
got
the
hops
but
you
can
already
tell
it
is
a
bw
this
early
in
the
maturation
compared
to
the
ipa
qualities
of
bigfoot
early
on
i
will
say
it
tastes
good
and
goes
down
easy
o
this
offering
didnt
really
impress
me
too
much
im
convinced
the
majority
of
their
offerings
are
much
better
on
tap
at
the
brewery
than
out
of
their
cans
and
this
one
confirms
my
theory
this
beer
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
not
much
better
than
an
average
barleywine
this
may
be
my
new
favorite
american
barleywine
reviews
be
damned
old
ruffians
not
easy
to
upseat
but
whatever
people
are
missing
here
is
gain
for
those
who
know
what
this
beer
should
be
overall
this
is
a
rather
elegant
brew
the
flavours
are
strong
yet
simplistic
while
remaining
interesting
okay
barleywine
holds
its
own
o
very
good
american
barleywine
would
have
liked
more
of
that
classic
melanoidin
malt
character
that
one
would
expect
from
a
barley
wine
in
the
flavor
it
was
also
surprisingly
lighter
in
body
than
i
had
originally
anticipated
however
its
not
a
deal
breaker
for
me
and
i
would
purchase
this
beer
again
mouthfeel
is
dry
but
thick
overall
pretty
good
not
great
pours
a
deep
amber
burnt
orange
color
with
a
bit
of
lacing
sweet
malty
aromas
with
a
nice
dose
of
hops
taste
is
caramel
toffee
malts
nicely
sweet
chewey
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
bit
dry
but
overall
a
nice
barleywine
o
a
nice
american
barleywine
that
reveals
more
malt
complexity
as
the
brew
warms
the
11
5
abv
packs
in
a
lot
of
malt
flavors
from
juicy
raisins
and
dried
apricots
to
toffeelike
sweetness
its
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
as
it
still
is
a
bit
boozy
and
cloying
in
the
finish
but
it
makes
for
a
nice
sipper
with
a
moderate
hop
punch
overall
a
very
overpriced
barleywine
that
only
gimmick
is
canning
only
8oz
and
charging
for
the
full
12
not
the
worst
barley
wine
but
i
have
had
better
overall
interesting
pouring
it
from
the
small
can
enjoyed
the
sweetness
and
smoothness
others
might
find
it
to
be
too
sweet
and
not
hoppy
enough
for
an
american
bwine
purchased
at
peekskill
beer
and
soda
peekskill
ny
a
few
days
ago
o
well
done
and
especially
like
the
small
8
oz
can
dont
have
to
commit
to
what
is
often
a
22
oz
bottle
of
very
strong
beer
bravo
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
developed
a
great
looking
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
appearance
was
a
deep
clear
amber
copper
color
aroma
was
of
a
light
fruit
with
some
malt
notes
tasted
malty
with
hints
of
fruit
anda
strong
back
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
was
heavy
with
a
lasting
sweet
malty
aftertaste
o
the
thing
i
like
about
this
beer
the
most
is
the
can
size
its
perfect
the
beer
itself
is
nice
and
smooth
its
not
the
most
over
the
top
barleywine
ive
had
or
the
most
extreme
but
it
does
have
a
nice
balance
and
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
keep
around
simply
because
its
a
perfect
size
for
a
nice
when
you
want
a
barleywine
but
dont
wanna
cross
the
line
at
least
for
me
but
hey
im
a
lightweight
o
this
is
high
on
alcohol
fairly
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
its
not
something
ill
be
hunting
down
much
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
a
big
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
an
8
4
oz
can
has
a
pretty
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
fruity
some
hops
as
well
taste
is
big
on
alcohol
hops
more
alcohol
a
touch
of
fruits
feels
medium
bodied
and
very
boozy
in
the
mouth
and
overall
while
not
terrible
wasnt
really
to
my
liking
overall
i
am
not
getting
much
out
of
this
or
having
a
desire
to
return
to
it
its
drinkable
and
perfectly
fine
but
not
my
thing
compared
to
other
barleywines
o
not
bad
a
hoped
up
barley
wine
the
11
5
abv
isnt
hidden
at
all
but
not
over
the
top
for
the
style
i
would
drink
it
again
if
i
find
this
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
yikes
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
that
21st
amendment
would
make
such
a
hot
mess
i
think
there
is
potential
here
but
for
my
tastes
it
needs
more
body
more
sweetnees
in
the
back
bone
and
dial
back
the
booze
the
hops
are
nice
but
they
dont
make
it
worth
drinking
the
other
3
before
this
has
spent
at
least
18
more
months
in
my
cellar
hopefully
calming
down
o
not
a
bad
barleywine
at
all
huge
flavors
and
decent
complexity
with
a
high
abv
that
is
hidden
fairly
well
it
doesnt
really
bring
anything
new
to
the
world
of
barleywines
but
its
a
solid
example
of
the
style
hops
are
a
bit
harsh
up
front
so
it
could
use
some
age
not
quite
as
abrasive
as
fresh
old
guardian
though
o
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
barleywine
i
cant
decide
if
i
like
the
can
size
or
not
on
the
one
hand
from
an
etoh
consumption
standpoint
its
great
but
the
beer
seemed
like
it
was
gone
before
i
could
completely
appreciate
it
a
pretty
easy
going
bw
not
a
world
beater
but
not
bad
in
any
aspect
a
nice
little
beer
worth
checking
out
when
you
dont
need
to
be
bowled
over
on
your
ass
but
want
a
nice
punch
of
kick
and
good
flavor
an
8oz
can
is
about
all
i
want
in
one
serving
a
sipper
that
is
not
really
special
enough
to
chose
this
one
over
the
increasingly
crowded
shelves
overall
a
good
barleywine
that
doesnt
stand
out
enough
despite
the
11
5
abv
8oz
can
deep
clear
ruby
with
a
finger
of
frothy
offwhite
head
this
retain
nicely
with
a
rich
flareup
that
leaves
back
robust
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
smells
of
dark
fruit
grains
brown
sugar
accents
ripe
citrus
and
a
slight
dankness
that
lends
this
a
bit
of
airiness
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
similar
being
sweet
and
fruity
up
front
with
notes
of
toffee
toasted
grains
brown
sugar
and
pithy
dark
cherry
all
being
present
before
an
assertive
hop
profile
takes
hold
and
leaves
this
feeling
bitter
and
resinous
a
lingering
graininess
and
a
sticky
combo
of
fruit
and
sweetness
hang
in
there
as
well
though
after
each
sip
the
feel
is
full
bodied
with
a
chewy
creaminess
to
the
carbonation
that
1112
abv
is
present
adding
some
extra
boldness
to
the
flavors
but
without
this
becoming
stinging
or
overly
taxing
on
the
palate
this
was
certainly
decent
for
such
a
big
take
on
a
barleywine
with
a
definite
boldness
to
the
flavor
and
feel
im
not
quite
sure
that
the
balance
was
quite
where
it
needed
to
be
but
its
relative
smoothness
and
having
to
commit
to
only
8oz
made
this
a
pleasant
and
warming
sipper
overall
meh
seems
a
little
half
hearted
lacking
much
punch
on
anything
except
booze
like
they
forgot
half
the
ingredients
and
this
was
served
at
pretty
much
room
temp
by
the
time
i
got
to
it
so
its
not
that
a
little
disappointed
for
a
mini
can
like
that
from
21st
a
can
served
in
a
pint
glass
dark
redamber
color
opaque
some
lacing
around
the
glass
not
much
aroma
taste
is
rich
creamy
leathery
caramel
malt
and
a
decent
amount
of
hop
bite
nothing
too
complex
however
and
any
sort
of
taste
in
the
finish
is
absent
mouthfeel
is
nothing
special
light
carbonation
cool
little
8
oz
can
deceptively
marketed
pours
a
nice
brown
with
a
sheet
of
light
tan
foam
smells
of
malts
some
soap
some
floral
hops
and
a
touch
of
sugar
nothing
special
flavor
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
lots
of
esters
hints
of
bubble
gum
and
banana
with
a
really
english
yeast
flavor
overly
sweet
for
me
medium
bodied
with
low
carb
and
a
slightly
sticky
finish
i
was
hoping
this
would
be
really
good
so
i
could
buy
a
good
bunch
for
the
cellar
but
alas
not
the
truth
poured
from
a
can
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
dark
slightly
hazed
ambercopper
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
ring
of
head
on
the
surface
aromas
of
tropical
fruits
heavily
ladened
with
mango
and
pineapple
with
a
subtle
roasting
and
some
darkly
sweet
fig
in
the
backbone
also
some
citrusy
spicing
throughout
the
nose
with
orange
zest
and
pepper
dancing
around
the
sinuses
flavors
are
heavily
roasted
and
rich
with
a
dark
caramel
backbone
and
tobacco
highlight
pepper
and
tamarind
spicing
throughout
with
a
subtle
boozey
kick
to
keep
your
tastebuds
going
the
tropical
fruit
becomes
a
much
more
blended
characteristic
on
the
palate
with
a
fruit
punch
feel
but
much
more
concentrated
resiny
characteristics
in
the
aftertaste
adding
to
the
richness
sharp
boozy
kick
at
the
end
of
the
aftertaste
leading
to
a
slick
slightly
bitter
tangy
lingering
finish
tasty
brew
o
great
barelywine
for
the
money
the
booze
notes
on
the
flavor
can
be
a
bit
much
and
the
aroma
is
my
truly
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
im
glad
they
started
canning
this
i
like
the
nice
citrus
notes
the
hops
impart
and
the
malt
is
not
cloying
but
it
is
enough
to
balance
the
bitterness
and
alcohol
is
not
overdone
for
the
11
5
overall
i
would
drink
this
again
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
american
barleywine
style
and
a
half
pint
is
a
good
sample
size
unless
you
would
prefer
to
share
overall
to
me
the
alcohol
was
a
little
overwhelming
and
it
really
took
control
of
the
flavors
and
aroma
with
some
age
it
would
mellow
out
considerably
im
sure
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
little
more
special
from
21st
amendment
this
one
just
falls
a
little
short
for
me
i
have
a
couple
more
cans
cellaring
in
the
basement
and
will
revisit
this
one
in
a
year
or
so
and
hopefully
get
the
flavors
i
was
yearning
for
o
nice
hop
touch
i
had
my
doubts
after
the
small
sample
the
bartender
insisted
i
tried
and
i
was
right
but
i
didnt
want
to
be
annoying
and
turn
down
the
sample
and
the
full
pour
i
may
order
this
again
to
give
it
another
go
i
just
need
to
develop
more
of
a
taste
for
barleywines
cheers
this
is
a
really
well
crafted
american
barleywine
really
good
stuff
fat
beer
in
a
little
can
othe
8
4oz
can
reminds
me
of
energy
drinks
almost
too
much
had
to
stop
a
friend
from
making
that
mistake
apparently
hes
illiterate
above
average
barely
wine
with
a
nice
story
behind
the
name
perhaps
some
aging
will
mute
the
booze
and
bring
forth
more
dark
fruits
another
good
brew
from
their
insurrection
series
which
i
like
much
more
then
their
regular
and
seasonal
lineup
its
got
a
little
bit
of
that
orange
cream
soda
thing
going
on
with
bitter
orange
peel
and
smooth
sweet
malt
not
as
hot
as
i
thought
it
would
be
theres
some
mellow
vanilla
and
a
slight
suggestion
of
conifer
o
a
very
nice
beer
and
one
ill
glad
have
with
decent
frequency
you
cant
beat
the
size
and
its
a
worthy
sipper
curious
to
see
if
this
gets
a
bit
sweeter
as
it
ages
3
753
53
53
53
25
overall
eh
not
a
bad
barleywine
enjoyable
sipper
to
be
sure
but
to
be
honest
hate
the
little
size
sure
its
cute
and
it
gets
noticed
guess
thats
what
they
are
going
for
if
you
want
me
to
buy
more
then
this
one
put
it
in
12oz
cans
this
is
a
solid
barleywine
hoppy
and
boozy
the
craftsmanship
is
definitely
there
it
just
lacks
true
depth
the
8
4oz
cans
are
an
interesting
choice
its
actually
perfect
for
a
beer
of
this
magnitude
but
at
the
same
time
it
leaves
you
wanting
more
im
interested
how
this
beer
would
do
with
some
age
on
it
o
a
very
respectable
barleywine
but
perhaps
nothing
mindblowing
i
do
draw
enjoyment
from
the
small
can
and
box
presentation
a
quick
fun
barleywine
fix
for
sure
id
buy
it
again
well
the
feel
on
this
beer
is
very
nice
slick
and
smooth
with
the
minimal
carbonation
i
want
to
see
flavor
is
good
but
seems
fairly
onedimensional
and
falls
off
too
soon
for
me
id
like
to
see
it
linger
more
really
and
id
like
more
complexity
but
maybe
ate
would
bring
that
out
perhaps
i
shall
get
more
to
see
what
happens
with
them
over
time
either
way
excellent
example
of
the
style
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
a
barleywine
ages
in
a
can
interesting
take
on
the
american
barleywine
style
im
used
to
a
ton
of
hop
bitterness
in
this
style
but
this
is
dank
and
floral
with
a
surprising
amount
of
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
sweetness
theres
still
some
dry
resinous
bitterness
but
hints
of
grapefruit
papaya
and
orange
peel
balance
things
out
earthy
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
leather
caramel
toffee
and
dark
fruit
notes
some
plum
raisin
and
date
add
a
vinous
character
that
compliments
the
sweetness
the
high
abv
is
very
well
masked
with
only
slight
heat
making
this
strong
beer
dangerously
drinkable
my
only
complaint
and
its
not
a
minor
one
is
that
the
bitterness
and
tropical
fruit
sweetness
overwhelm
the
barleywine
characteristics
a
bit
too
sweet
and
in
my
opinion
needs
more
heat
and
malt
flavor
otherwise
its
a
pretty
solid
enjoyable
beer
wow
that
has
every
aspect
of
a
barley
wine
youd
expect
this
is
a
massive
massive
beer
in
a
tiny
little
can
big
grapefruit
hop
explosion
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
along
sweet
malts
roll
into
big
pine
flavor
toffee
caramel
rum
raisins
and
other
dark
fruits
raw
herbal
hop
on
the
finish
with
giant
underlying
bitterness
and
a
lingering
sweetness
as
expected
a
bit
of
a
boozey
finish
as
well
lots
of
malt
dark
sweet
fruit
flavors
with
piney
and
bright
hop
flavors
all
with
a
boozing
as
throughout
lots
of
good
flavors
and
again
every
flavor
youd
possibly
expect
from
a
barley
wine
but
it
seems
a
little
young
while
the
flavors
arent
offensive
and
match
each
other
rather
equally
they
need
a
little
time
to
mellow
out
and
find
their
groove
overall
i
hate
the
8
4
oz
can
size
im
not
a
rookie
i
can
handle
12
oz
just
fine
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
rather
hot
and
nothing
special
abut
this
balance
is
fine
flavor
is
fine
but
its
not
as
complex
as
a
bigfoot
or
as
flavorful
not
bad
would
like
to
try
this
one
with
a
few
years
on
it
solid
beer
maybe
next
year
release
it
in
12
oz
cans
8
4oz
can
canned
on
021513
on
the
bottom
pours
a
reddish
dark
brown
color
with
almost
no
head
some
lacing
the
aroma
has
alot
going
on
boozey
with
some
malts
dark
cherries
sweet
orange
and
maybe
a
bit
of
cough
syrup
the
taste
is
malty
and
boozey
followed
by
cherry
cough
syrup
a
bit
woody
some
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
but
not
much
of
the
orange
i
got
in
the
nose
medium
bodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
little
more
than
a
month
old
but
isnt
overly
hot
interested
in
seeing
how
it
ages
overall
hate
the
8oz
can
really
like
the
beer
i
will
make
it
a
point
to
get
this
again
and
since
it
is
sunday
again
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
copper
color
the
head
was
fizzy
and
white
with
a
light
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
malty
with
a
decent
hoppy
aroma
in
there
as
well
sweet
smelling
with
some
citrus
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
loaded
with
caramel
flavors
with
a
bitter
citrus
flavor
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sharp
on
the
carbonation
overall
its
a
decent
barley
wine
its
good
it
might
be
better
with
age
also
this
is
a
rather
good
beer
it
has
a
huge
malt
presence
as
is
to
be
expected
and
a
mild
hop
character
the
alcohol
is
intense
but
not
overwhelming
the
tropical
fruit
nose
a
bit
different
but
intriguing
this
is
an
all
around
enjoyable
beer
it
may
not
be
the
most
complex
but
it
does
come
in
this
adorable
little
can
ill
definitely
have
another
caramel
grapefruit
booze
and
candy
start
this
off
the
canning
date
was
a
month
ago
and
this
beast
needs
age
right
now
its
a
wild
and
obnoxious
youth
two
maybe
three
years
from
now
this
will
probably
be
much
much
better
dropped
two
in
the
cellar
so
i
will
certainly
rereview
overall
this
is
a
decent
barleywine
the
fruitycitrus
taste
was
good
but
not
great
got
a
little
tiresome
even
from
the
small
can
worth
finding
and
trying
but
overall
just
not
my
style
of
bw
i
will
say
the
8
4
oz
was
an
interesting
can
i
hope
some
of
the
other
high
alcohol
beers
take
this
concept
plus
its
pretty
easy
to
sneak
into
a
sporting
event
just
saying
overall
im
probably
jaded
after
sucaba
and
now
arctic
devil
and
moas
yeah
i
know
those
are
barrel
aged
also
just
had
an
st
backburner
that
was
very
nice
so
many
great
barleys
this
is
tasty
but
not
great
as
a
barley
wine
fan
this
is
a
good
choice
amongst
some
pretty
lame
american
barleywines
better
flavor
than
the
bigfoot
from
sierra
nevada
overall
a
barleywine
you
say
sure
to
it
a
good
citrus
punch
this
is
the
first
beer
from
21st
that
i
actually
like
the
high
gravity
helps
with
this
style
and
i
believe
they
hit
it
on
the
head
with
this
one
overall
a
good
drinkable
beer
and
meets
the
expectations
of
the
style
looks
tastes
and
feels
like
a
good
barlywine
and
im
not
typically
a
barlywine
or
21st
fan
have
one
and
probst
heres
what
they
say
about
it
deep
mahogany
color
rich
malt
candied
rock
sugar
flavors
with
sweet
burnt
currant
and
fig
aromas
its
strong
alcohol
content
is
tempered
by
a
clean
bitterness
and
complex
flavors
this
barley
wine
is
named
for
cornelius
de
boom
the
san
francisco
belgian
consulate
general
1850
to
1851
and
surprisingly
the
name
of
the
alley
alongside
the
21st
amendment
on
2nd
street
on
tap
at
sessions
yesterday
poured
a
deep
amber
with
a
thinner
off
white
head
atop
alot
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
malts
in
the
nosea
decent
shot
of
resiny
hop
lingers
quite
sweet
and
cakelike
on
the
palatealot
of
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruitagain
there
is
a
decent
shot
of
resiny
hops
in
a
lingering
finish
its
hybrid
to
me
between
an
english
and
american
barleywine
with
its
big
sweet
malty
flavors
and
hoppedup
finishnot
bad
but
not
overly
drinkable
o
decent
for
the
style
21st
ammendment
did
a
good
job
with
this
those
who
enjoy
the
style
should
give
it
a
try
o
this
one
became
overly
sweet
for
me
this
one
was
even
fresh
but
it
seemed
that
the
hops
were
ousted
by
the
malt
bill
it
wouldnt
have
been
bad
if
there
was
a
little
more
balance
o
very
different
but
very
good
still
i
appreciated
the
opportunity
to
have
had
this
on
tap
o
this
is
a
good
barleywine
to
sip
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
from
the
taste
o
enjoyable
but
very
sweet
glad
to
sip
on
this
beer
but
i
did
not
want
a
very
large
pour
of
this
one
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
butterscotch
jumps
off
the
palate
at
me
it
dominates
the
midpalate
by
a
lot
and
it
is
a
little
offputting
by
the
time
i
finished
i
knew
i
didnt
want
more
the
beer
does
have
a
nice
finish
mildly
dry
mildly
sweet
throughout
not
a
repeat
o
very
very
enjoyable
barley
wine
from
21st
and
i
wish
i
could
see
how
cans
stack
up
to
the
kegs
definitely
recommended
the
body
was
good
fairly
typical
for
the
style
although
the
beer
did
have
a
slightly
syrupy
finish
drinkability
was
pretty
good
smooth
and
easy
it
went
dangerously
easy
overall
a
pretyy
good
but
not
great
example
of
the
style
certainly
worth
trying
when
you
see
it

never

to
a

moderately
harsh

finish
not

not
great
bigfoot
fans
may
enjoy
this
pours
deep
clear
copper
with
gold
edges
and
persistent
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
has
a
decidedly
sugar
roast
malt
character
with
dark
fruity
esters
in
the
back
i
also
get
a
mild
chemical
alcohol
note
that
is
only
slightly
distracting
the
flavor
has
an
initial
pulse
of
lightly
roast
malts
mixing
with
a
sugary
sweet
maltiness
before
the
dark
fruity
esters
join
in
it
has
a
pretty
smooth
flavor
but
struggles
to
hide
the
alcohol
and
makes
for
a
bit
of
a
rough

than
i
recall
from
the
toronado
in
2008
i
had
this
10
6
abv
barleywine
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
san
francisco
ca
it
had
a
thick
white
bubbly
head
over
an
inch
thick
on
top
of
a
deep
redbrown
color
served
in
a
snifter
it
was
cloudy
had
lots
of
lacing
the
smell
was
both
sweet
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
sort
of
like
a
cider
or
apple
juice
just
with
more
alcohol
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
of
strong
bitter
hops
with
a
hops
and
alcohol
aftertaste
hops
is
the
predominant
taste
though
it
doesnt
come
out
in
the
aroma
later
in
the
aftertaste
there
is
a
more
complex
fruity
and
apples
flavor

might
not
be
the
best
bba
barleywine
youll
ever
have
but
it
had
a
kind
of
unique
flavor
very
tasty
a
very
enjoyable
effort
o
barrel
aging
seems
to
be
coming
off
a
bit
harsh
and
the
hops
stay
way
too
prominent
good
beer
but
needs
some
maturing
edit
the
above
review
was
perhaps
too
dependent
on
initial
impressions
the
weird
flavors
do
mellow
some
as
the
beer
progresses
i
increased
the
score
by
a
quarter
point
overall
a
soso
american
barleywine
there
is
a
good
malt
presence
along
with
the
woodiness
from
the
oak
barrels
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
assertive
bitterness
from
the
hops
this
one
is
a
definitely
a
sipper
as
the
abv
is
quite
noticeable
ok
so
what
we
have
here
is
a
seemingly
and
strangely
bottlereconditioned
the
froth
she
dont
lie
barleywine
of
englishstyle
extraction
the
hops
apparently
just
incapable
of
speaking
for
themselves
with
some
of
the
titular
oldladys
um
bluehaired
musty
crustiness
resplendent
everywhere
nah
not
for
me
not
for
me
at
all
review
this
barley
wine
is
pretty
legit
as
with
most
barley
wines
by
the
time
i
get
thru
half
the
bottle
ive
got
angels
dancing
behind
my
eyeballs
which
is
very
pleasing
this
beer
as
with
most
good
beers
reminds
me
of
times
in
my
past
which
were
fun
and
memorable
if
anyone
is
on
the
fence
about
trying
it
i
would
say
go
for
it
youve
got
nothing
to
lose
if
they
have
more
at
total
wine
i
will
probably
buy
teo
bottles
one
to
drink
and
one
to
stick
way
back
in
the
back
of
the
pantry
for
about
a
year
to
see
how
it
goes
later
on
enjoy
once
the
massive
head
settled
to
a
reasonable
level
the
liquid
below
it
was
a
dull
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
gooey
murkiness
to
it
in
the
nose
phenols
and
some
herbal
bitterness
lesser
notes
of
caramel
and
yeast
the
taste
was
definitely
weird
and
off
but
i
actually
didnt
think
it
was
completely
undrinkable
there
were
flavors
of
caramel
and
bready
bretty
yeast
cooking
sherry
and
actually
lots
of
herbal
hops
not
very
good
and
possibly
infected
but
as
i
said
i
didnt
find
it
undrinkable
surprisingly
did
i
go
back
for
more
after
my
little
sampler
nope
lightmedium
body
and
pretty
thinned
out
in
the
mouthfeel
overall
this
beer
was
a
huge
mess
and
not
at
all
what
i
like
in
my
barleywines
i
had
a
sample
glass
at
the
brewery
and
was
impressed
enough
to
take
home
a
growler
it
has
a
wonderful
reddish
brown
color
with
a
two
to
three
finger
off
white
head
the
aroma
of
fine
barley
malt
is
immediately
apparent
it
tastes
better
than
it
smells
too
and
has
a
nice
balance
of
malt
to
hops
all
in
all
a
great
barley
wine
well
done
overall
this
brew
is
awesome
big
sky
imho
has
nailed
down
the
length
of
time
to
barrel
age
their
brews
not
to
overly
boozy
but
enough
barrel
flavor
to
blend
nicely
with
the
base
beer
this
rates
right
up
there
with
firestone
walkers
sucaba
o
overall
not
bad
but
compared
to
beers
like
sucaba
it
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
it
has
good
flavors
and
complexity
but
the
flavors
are
not
very
well
rounded
and
there
is
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
heat
for
the
abv
it
could
be
hidden
better
o
a
nice
enjoyable
ba
barley
worth
hunting
down
for
the
fans
of
the
style

got

try
it
and
unfortunately
this
one
was
a

too
fresh
still
a

going

one
that
i
would
put
on
the
same
playing
field
as
sucaba
its
that
good

if

consistent

with
the
addition
of

as

as

unfortunately
the
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
kills
it
for
me
way
too
much
carbonation
first
off
however
once
you
get
past
that
it
comes
off
somewhat
thin
and
slightly
oily
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
i
have
a
second
bottle
so
ill
have
to
see
what
35
years
does
for
this
beer
hopefully
it
will
dissipate
the
carbonation
one
other
note
be
careful
with
this
vintage
at
least
overcarbonation
seems
to
be
an
issue
i
sent
a
bottle
in
a
trade
that
broke
only
bottle
break
ive
ever
had
break
in
transit
assuming
it
was
the
pressure
on
the
cc
and
ive
seen
lots
of
feedback
on
overcarbed
bottles
and
semigushers
m
medium
body
almost
full
body
moderate
carbonation
a
little
overcarbonated
which
likely
detracts
from
the
mouth
feel
pours
a
murky
red
amber
color
this
one
looks
to
be
super
over
carbonated
the
smell
is
sweet
im
getting
dark
fruit
caramel
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
carbonation
distracts
from
the
taste
which
is
pretty
good
otherwise
lots
of
caramel
malts
and
some
vanilla
from
the
barrel
the
bourbon
is
smooth
with
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
burn
o
i
thought
it
was
a
decent
barleywine
and
was
worth
trying
overall
the
flavors
are
ok
but
its
mouthfeel
is
a
tremendous
let
down
thin
kinda
they
way
i
felt
about
ivan
the
terrible
d
i
think
the
beer
is
good
but
not
quite
as
good
as
maybe
say
mirror
mirror
or
some
others
more
malt
forward
than
many
popular
barley
wines
which
i
like
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
worth
a
try
but
i
would
split
the
cost
if
i
could
not
bad
nice
blend
of
bourbon
and
malt
dont
know
why
the
wanted
the
carbonation
to
be
so
high
really
detracts
from
the
flavor
imo
o
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
this
one
but
it
wasnt
too
bad
it
definitely
improved
as
it
warmed
and
i
would
love
to
see
this
with
a
few
more
years
of
age
o
a
big
and
boozy
barleywine
bourbon
is
quite
strong
in
this
one
unfortunately
overpowers
the
barleywine
aspects
a
bit
i
feel
with
some
age
on
this
i
think
it
could
be
stunning
however
its
pretty
good
as
is
just
quite
sharp
boozy
and
bourbon
heavy
heavy
and
sweet
a
sipper
for
sure
whoa
this
is
some
really
good
stuff
and
a
gift
from
good
ol
paul
b
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
large
billowy
fluffy
light
tan
head
that
settled
after
a
bit
and
no
lace
color
is
a
slightly
hazy
amber
red
aroma
is
yeast
malt
dark
ripe
fruit
burnt
sugar
flavors
much
like
nose
with
bittersweet
malt
balanced
very
nicely
with
perfect
carbonic
tang
body
is
perhaps
the
best
ive
ever
had
for
a
barley
wine
and
despite
its
power
is
quite
drinkable
with
mouth
filling
textures
accented
by
aggresive
appropriate
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
of
average
length
a
little
boozy
and
tasty
gracias
por
esta
paulo
overall
i
must
say
that
this
has
been
a
want
of
mine
for
a
very
long
time
and
it
didnt
disappoint
it
could
have
had
some
more
barrel
in
the
nose
and
taste
but
overall
a
pretty
good
barleywine
pick
this
up
if
you
can
but
dont
trade
the
world
for
it
overall
solid
offering
by
big
sky
it
a
tasty
beer
but
its
overcarbonated
the
beer
was
not
a
gusher
when
the
cc
was
opened
but
you
gotta
pour
this
beer
really
gently
i
wonder
if
the
carbonation
will
get
better
with
sometime
o
good
beer
that
could
have
been
great
there
are
elements
of
a
fantastic
barleywine
in
there
that
were
undone
by
one
glaring
flaw
i
definitely
will
pick
up
another
vintage
of
this
when
i
find
myself
in
seattle
again
hopefully
its
sooner
rather
than
later
o
good
but
i
definitely
prefer
barrelaging
in
less
hoppy
barleywines
the
old
hop
character
while
interesting
in
its
own
right
sort
of
covered
up
some
of
the
barrel
character
thanks
to
thirstyherf
for
sharing
this
bottle
a
great
americanbrewed
barleywine
that
still
seems
to
be
flying
under
the
radar
deep
amber
khaki
head
big
dark
fruit
notes
on
the
nose
raisin
and
currant
toffee
and
caramel
notes
are
at
the
forefront
too
but
the
dryness
allows
the
hops
to
stand
firm
balancing
herbal
flavors
with
a
smooth
bitterness
complementary
fruit
from
yeast
adds
a
nice
depth
of
flavor
o
maybe
a
touch
underrated
i
think
very
nice
barleywine
lots
of
fruit
flavors
and
enough
of
the
barrel
to
carry
this
very
well
something
i
would
seek
out
again
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
a
little
high
for
the
style
overall
it
had
a
nice
rich
malty
profile
for
the
style
and
what
was
left
of
the
american
hop
profile
blended
in
pretty
well
the
barrel
was
a
little
more
reserved
than
i
would
have
preferred
but
it
added
a
little
character
to
it
pretty
solid
overall
o
i
wish
i
could
recall
the
vintage
on
this
a
i
remember
thinking
that
this
has
held
up
really
well
it
may
not
be
the
best
of
the
ba
barleywine
bunch
but
its
certainly
upper
middle
class
and
there
aint
nothin
wrong
with
that
o
i
think
this
beer
is
right
at
its
sweet
spot
and
drinking
quite
nicely
if
youve
got
some
2010s
laying
around
pop
them
open
now
its
time
to
play
the
waiting
game
with
the
2011
vintage
pours
a
slightly
murky
red
brown
amber
nice
thick
long
lasting
offwhite
head
with
lacing
nice
presentation
sweet
malt
light
fruit
and
oak
aroma
smells
good
sweet
malt
dark
and
light
fruit
bourbon
and
oak
finishes
sweet
and
oaky
creamy
body
an
excellent
barley
wine
overall
this
is
a
decent
bba
barleywine
that
has
decent
flavors
but
i
wish
the
barrel
flavors
shined
a
bit
more
there
is
contribution
but
it
deserves
more
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on

of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
citrus
zest
vanilla
and
bourbon
taste
is
the
same
with
a
woody
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
smooth
and
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
barleywine
with
a
nice
barrel
aged
presence
full
bodied
but
mysteriously
refreshing
old
bluechair
delivers
a
wallop
of
maltyrich
texture
with
a
carbonated
creamy
effect
but
the
mid
palate
creeps
in
with
a
lightly
peppery
heat
at
mid
palate
that
develops
into
alcohol
heat
to
finish
doing
so
with
a
hoppy
resin
dryness
and
ethanol
warmth
that
closes
the
beer
with
confidence
and
semidry
character
that
drives
a
malty
fruit
aftertaste
drink
the
entire
reason
i
went
to
hamiltons
was
because
this
was
on
the
bottle
list
i
was
not
dissapointed
with
my
choice
i
had
this
right
after
the
blind
tiger
grilled
cheese
very
good
time
would
love
another
bottle
to
share
with
some
friends
again
o
different
than
most
barley
wines
but
enjoyable
i
had
the
2009
vintage
after
more
aging
and
it
enjoyed
it
more
than
this
one
give
it
some
time
to
age
barrel
aging
flavor
isnt
too
dominant
a
good
thing
in
this
case
a
fun
beer
from
big
sky
showing
they
can
produce
a
nice
big
beer
on
tap
at
stone
though
the
abv
on
the
beer
menu
clearly
lists
8
75
abv
served
in
a
snifter
arrives
a
couldy
deep
dark
amber
color
with
ruby
colored
edges
in
the
light
one
finger
beige
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
earthy
with
hints
of
oak
dark
fruit
roasted
barley
and
a
leathery
character
a
touch
of
bourbon
the
flavor
starts
with
a
raisin
and
fig
fruitiness
similar
to
the
fruit
found
on
the
tongue
hints
of
bourbon
and
vanilla
mild
bitterness
medium
bodied
and
finishes
with
a
lingering
taste
of
toasted
oak
as
it
warms
the
vanilla
and
malt
are
more
prevalent
and
overcome
the
strong
boozy
character
overall
i
found
the
beer
to
be
a
bit
harsh
very
complex
though
doesnt
seem
to
be
mellowed
yet
overall
probably
should
have
opened
this
one
612
months
ago
but
it
hints
at
having
been
a
great
beer
at
some
point
overall
im
really
glad
i
pulled
this
one
from
the
cellar
its
a
perfect
complement
to
a
cold
winter
evening
cheers
solid
ba
barleywine
at
least
as
good
as
that
blighs
stuff
pretty
much
a
must
try
for
any
barleywine
fan
decently
priced
picked
mine
up
for
13
i
believe
in
az
saw
it
for
the
price
in
bend
or
as
well
full
bodied
chewy
smooth
and
properly
carbonated
sweet
aftertaste
and
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
for
10
50
but
then
again
i
held
onto
this
for
a
while
before
drinking
it
i
recommend
trying
this
beer
if
you
get
the
chance
medium
body
with
soft
carbonation
up
front
with
a
strong
barrel
presence
thats
a
bit
harsh
with
lots
of
toasted
oak
and
sweet
booz
as
it
warms
there
is
some
vanilla
and
the
sweeter
malts
and
dark
fruit
notes
shine
leathery
and
musty
with
some
sweet
caramel
and
nut
along
with
hints
of
fig
plum
and
apple
decent
but
kind
of
harsh
up
front
finishes
nice
o
a
nice
offering
but
not
my
favorite
big
sky
brew
recommended
to
barleywine
fans
d
a
solid
barleywine
age
could
further
help
this
out
to
its
advantage
though
it
is
quite
nice
rich
but
a
mellowsubtle
barrel
aging
o
this
was
a
different
one
i
really
liked
it
but
it
caught
me
off
guard
not
tasting
as
i
would
expect
a
baleywine
to
taste
the
barrel
did
wonders
for
the
flavor
it
was
a
solid
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
revisiting
this
one
in
the
future
thanks
adam
for
bringing
this
obscure
gem
my
way
not
sure
what
some
time
would
do
to
this
seeing
how
its
already
a
mellow
brew
but
id
like
to
find
out
and
i
doubt
i
ever
will
ov
drinks
like
a
10
yr
old
barleywine
great
balance
very
hard
to
beat
brown
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
on
top
that
hung
around
for
a
good
few
minutes
before
settling
down
into
a
thin
layer
on
top
one
of
the
best
aromas
i
have
ever
come
across
rich
bourbon
notes
just
rippling
across
the
nose
lots
of
toffee
and
vanilla
light
touchs
of
oak
and
a
piney
hop
presence
as
well
so
immacualtly
complex
nothing
subtle
about
this
beast
at
all
rich
toffee
and
oak
flavors
are
all
over
the
place
huge
hop
notes
coming
through
with
a
nice
alcohol
hotness
that
is
really
well
placed
a
very
tight
flavor
here
with
a
long
lingering
vanilla
flavor
that
lasted
long
after
my
last
sip
2010
bottle
pours
an
off
colored
orange
with
a
small
tannish
head
caramel
malts
vanilla
oak
toffee
waft
off
of
the
nose
the
taste
is
like
the
nose
with
the
vanilla
from
the
bourbon
melding
very
nicely
with
the
caramel
and
toffee
base
beer
flavors
actual
bourbon
and
oak
are
subdued
sweet
but
not
excessively
so
from
a
slight
hop
balance
mouthfeel
is
relatively
large
with
a
light
carbonation
seems
right
for
the
style
overall
this
beer
is
a
really
nice
option
for
the
ba
barleywine
category
as
a
fairly
accessible
and
not
too
expensive
option
almost
the
definition
of
a
b
beer
in
my
book
pours
a
light
yellowed
orange
light
offwhite
head
smells
like
caramel
almost
a
toffee
aroma
very
malty
with
some
light
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
oak
barrel
isnt
huge
on
the
nose
tastes
sweet
and
malty
again
lots
of
caramel
barrel
characteristics
are
strong
but
not
overwhelming
well
balances
overall
very
enjoyable
medium
to
thick
slightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
a
very
nice
barrelaged
beer
well
balanced
though
maltheads
and
hopheads
alike
may
find
something
missing
if
they
are
glasshalfempty
types
overall
if
this
isnt
infected
its
really
not
to
my
liking
theres
the
possibility
that
i
got
an
infected
bottle
or
that
there
is
a
good
deal
of
bottle
variation
whatever
i
had
i
didnt
really
care
for
it
ill
try
the
next
vintage
i
can
get
my
hands
on
to
compare
to
this
one
especially
to
see
if
there
may
have
just
been
an
infection
in
this
bottle
but
i
dont
think
thats
the
case
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
after
a
long
hard
day
it
really
reminded
me
of
a
less
aggressive
yet
still
fullflavored
firestone
walker
abacus
abacus
is
a
more
complex
beer
but
also
much
more
in
your
face
each
has
its
time
and
place
and
i
was
definitely
more
in
the
mood
for
this
abacus
lite
highly
recommended
and
i
will
be
seeking
this
out
each
year
it
becomes
available
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
sweet
up
front
with
a
mildly
dry
finish
a
nice
bourbon
character
on
the
midpalate
and
a
great
finish
with
more
in
the
body
in
the
midpalate
than
expected
the
toffee
comes
through
nicely
and
finishes
strong
i
really
enjoyed
it
one
of
the
better
beers
of
the
night
imo
really
a
nice
brew
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
big
thanks
goes
out
to
my
boy
lunch
for
sending
me
this
one
in
a
past
trade
shared
this
one
with

huge
number
of

into
a

snifter
poured
redorange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
and
wood
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
wood
and
sweet
alcohol
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
the
barrel
aging
on
this
brew
really
mellowed
out
a
lot
of
the
flavors
that
are
typical
in
a
big
abv
barleywine
this
fact
made
this
one
really
drinkable
for
all
who
had
the
chance
to
try
it
the
aroma
was
pretty
good
as
well
but
nothing
aweinspiring
by
any
means
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
opportunity
750ml

thanks
to
harrymel
caramel
color
decent
but
short
head
smells
pretty
good
like
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
also
quite
nice
malt
toffee
caramel
and
just
a
touch
of
barrel
i
really
liked
how
the
barrel
aging
was
very
subdued
and
didnt
make
a
bourbon
bomb
out
of
this
one
recommended
if
you
like
barleywines
appears
reddish
brown
with
a
creamy
tan
cap
recedes
quickly
but
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
just
a
bit
hazy
smells
predominantly
of
bourbon
sweet
fruits
caramel
malt
toffee
and
wood
despite
the
powerful
bourbon
aroma
it
does
not
seem
hot
taste
matches
the
smell
but
there
is
much
more
balance
caramel
and
toffee
maltiness
up
front
alcohol
soaked
dark
fruits
in
the
middle
and
barrel
in
the
finish
the
bourbon
is
very
well
integrated
adding
flavor
throughout
and
a
subtle
warmth
to
the
finish
mediumfull
body
low
carbonation
very
smooth
texture
at
first
but
leaves
a
sticky
residual
feeling
easy
to
drink
but
the
strength
is
noticeable
after
a
few
sips
d
awesome
drink
great
taste
and
smell
i
love
this
stuff
dont
pass
it
up
if
you
have
a
chance
to
try
a
sip
or
two
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
ill
definitely
have
to
try
more
beers
from
big
sky
they
impressed
me
with
this
batch
o
i
have
really
enjoyed
the
barrel
aged
big
sky
beers
ive
had
and
this
was
no
exception
o
interesting
flavor
in
this
barleywine
not
like
anything
ive
had
before
i
would
buy
this
again
but
probably
special
occasions
its
a
spendy
one
overall
this
is
just
a
little
off
for
a
typical
barleywine
o
ha
this
beer
was
on
my
wants
for
a
long
time
along
with
ivan
glad
i
didnt
trade
for
this
one
in
particular
md
medium
body
medium
carbonation
not
hoppy
as
barleywines
go
on
the
sweeter
side
too
its
good
not
syrupy
like
some
but
nothing
amazing
and
at
16
a
bottle
its
a
onetime

this
is
a
delicious
beer
overall
im
very
impressed
by
this
ive
been
fortunate
enough
to
score
a
bottle
of
ivan
and
this
all
in
a
months
time
overall
a
nice
beer
dense
and
appropriately
rich
the
barrel
aging
is
nicely
done
though
the
base
beer
may
fall
a
hair
short
overall
still
wellexecuted
drinks
too
easy
for
the
abv
style
this
works
this
is
good
this
is
mmm
yum
plus
oh
yeah
this
is
my
first
experience
with
big
sky
brewing
company
and
its
been
a
good
one
olde
bluehair
is
a
pretty
impressive
barrelaged
barleywine
the
flavor
delivers
and
the
subtle
bourbon
presence
works
extremely
well
a
little
less
carbonation
would
improve
things
a
little
maybe
a
bit
of
hops
would
too
im
curious
as
to
whether
theyre
present
in
a
fresh
bottle
perhaps
another
day
easily
recommended
d
this
is
a
really
good
barleywine
great
balance
and
taste
my
new
favorite
big
sky
brew
gotta
find
some
ivan
now
i
really
like
this
brew
and
wish
i
had
another
one
good
stuff
mouthfeel
is
flat
a
little
watery
due
to
too
much
alcohol
in
the
flavor
and
unpleasant
flatness
i
have
not
enjoyed
this
much
thanks
sholle
for
the
opportunity
d
a
nice
barleywine
but
a
little
harsh
in
the
taste
probably
would
be
better
with
some
age
on
it
would
like
to
have
again
with
some
time
on
it
if
your
looking
for
a
hoppy
barleywine
bigfoot
then
this
is
not
your
beer
however
if
your
like
me
and
appreciate
a
nice
malty
bw
this
is
a
great
example
im
glad
i
bought
a
couple
bottles
because
i
think
this
beer
will
be
an
a
in
12
years
ill
update
this
review
when
i
open
another
bottle
d
very
quaffable
but
not
terribly
exciting
overall
im
actually
not
a
huge
fan
of
barleywines
but
this
one
is
good
bottle
2062

into
a
tulip
glass
a
murky
orange
apricot
color
with
a
light
tan
head
sweet
aroma
in
the
nose
of
fruit
and
slight
citrus
hops
very
subtle
aroma
for
a
barley
wine
sweet
start
wtih
some
latent
hops
pretty
smooth

not
extremely

this

a

in

more

came
into
play
like
dark

some
cakiness
its
a
bit
sharp
in

mouth
but
not
to
annoyingits
pretty
good
but
a
little
one
dimensional
with
the
barrel
aging
really
taking
over
the
beer
i
dont
think
its
worth
the
big
price
paid
mouthfeel
body
is
right
on
medium
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
as
it
warms
the
carbonation
mellows
out
a
little
and
it
gets
smoother
drinking
it
is
very
easy
drinking
for
the
style
even
though
abv
is

it
seems
like
less
this
is
hands
down
my
favorite
example
of
a
barleywine
that
ive
had
to
date
i
definitely
want
to
have
a
couple
of
these
on
hand
for
a
while
to
see
what
age
does
in
my
humble
opinion
big
sky
is
one
of
americas
most
underappreciated
breweries
they
have
gotten
more
of
my
money
thanks
to
their
outstanding
ipa
than
anyone
else
in
this
country
over
the
past
several
years
barrel
aged
olde
bluehair
barley
wine
may
not
be
transcent
beer
but
its
a
delicous
and
drinkable
effort
that
is
well
worth
the
purchase
price
d
awesome
love
this
one
great
beer
name
snifter
pour
and
an
amber
colored
ale
with
burgundy
streaks
is
produced
with
a
small
offwhite
foamy
head
aroma
consists
of
hoppy
goodness
with
some
candy
and
malt
in
the
mix
very
hoppy
taste
for
a
2008
and
though
it
lists
the
ibus
at
75
this
tastes
much
more
hoppy
than
that
maybe
the
age
intensifies
it
hmmmm
malty
backbone
blends
the
two
tastes
perfectly
full
bodied
chewy
mouthfeel

couldnt
even
tell
it
was
this
high
smooth
drink
and
highly
recommended
wish
it
was
distributed
nationwide
if
you
find
it
let
it
age
some
to
really
get
the
most
out
of
it
the
beer
poured
a
clear
copper
with
nice
fine
carbonation
bubbles
aroma
was
typical
of
a
barley
wine
but
very
muted
and
mellow
time
has
done
wonderful
things
to
this
beer
it
is
very
nicely
balanced
bitterness
and
malt
wise
the
malt
is
not
forward
at
all
and
tapers
off
towards
the
end
there
is
also
a
dark
fruit
plum
flavor
present
reasonable
carbonation
with
small
bubbles
cleanses
your
palate
as
you
drink
it
i
definitely
went
back
for
seconds
on
this
one
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
small
dirty
white
head
not
much
carbonation
going
on
nose
is
faint
but
i
did
find
some
dried
fruits
brown
sugar
oak
bourbon
and
caramel
taste
is
dried
fruits
vanilla
oak
bourbon
dried
fruits
brown
sugar
there
was
an
off
astringent
like
taste
abv
is
very
tolerable
keeping
iot
very
drinkable
and
not
masking
the
flavors
mouthfeel
is
nice
creamy
coating
and
sugary
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
with
an
understated
bourbon
presence
which
really
leads
to
a
very
drinkable
barrelaged
brew
dat
8
75
could
this
be
deemed
light
for
a
barleywine
well
no
matter
it
is
packed
full
of
tasty
flavours
and
an
outstanding
smoothness
i
could
enjoy
this
one
all
night
long
beside
the
fire
d
entirely
too
easy
to
drink
this
goes
down
dangerously
easy
excellent
flavors
and
a
nice
balance
of
oak
whiskey
and
malt
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
if
i
get
the
chance
to
try
this
again
i
definitely
will
highly
recommended
a
little
dissapointing
overall
but
definatley
not
bad
just
really
plain
and
forgetable
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
some
warmth
going
down
a
pretty
enjoyable
ba
barleywine
thanks
preric
i
liked
it
a
rare
treat
this
is
a
well
balanced
moreish
barleywine
nice
woodiness
and
vanilla
from
the
barrels
very
faint
hints
of
bourbon
still
a
faint
hop
bite
in
the
finish
raisins
plums
candied
sugar
caramel
light
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
as
well
the
only
downfall
on
this
one
is
the
body
which
is
a
little
light
almost
watery
for
a
barleywine
makes
it
more
drinkable
perhaps
but
you
might
want
a
little
more
bulk
to
brink
out
some
of
the
flavors
as
is
pretty
drinkable
dont
worry
about
opening
the
bottle
by
yourself
d
a
decent
drinker
d
the
alcohol
isnt
all
that
well
hidden
i
thought
this
was
more
than
8
75
the
tannic
bite
in
the
finish
also
makes
it
a
little
hard
to
drink
a
lot
pours
clear
deep
copper
with
thin
tan
head
the
modest
aroma
has
notes
of
prunes
figs
and
sweet
crystal
malts
the
taste
starts
rich
and
sweet
with
malt
fig
raisin
and
plum
sweetness
midway
and
to
the
finish
alcohol
chemical
notes
show
up
along
with
a
layer
of
pine
hop
bitterness
could
use
some
more
age
to
mellow
a
bit
it
does
have
a
mildly
drying
malt
roastiness
into
the
finish
d
not
as
good
as
the
schlafly
oak
aged
bw
but
well
worth
drinking
especially
if
you
can
find
it
poured
into
a
chalice
a
very
nice
amber
color
very
nice
carbonation
this
brew
has
probably
the
nicest
head
from
a
bwsa
to
date
for
me
huge
twofinger
plus
creamy
thick
light
tan
head
with
tons
of

behind
the

is

the

medium
body
goes
down
pretty
smooth

hidden
very
well
which
is
not
high
but
easy
drinking
very
drinkable
really
enjoying
this
one
today
highly
recommended
medium
bodied
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
which
i
liked
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
d
im
very
sorry
to
see
the
empty
bottle
thanks
to
johngalt1
for
an
excellent
surprise
barleywine
id
never
heard
of
this
until
i
saw
it
in
the
box
thanks
again
toby
very
good
beer
hopefully
big
sky
continues
to
have
some
wild
adolescent
fantasties
like
this
to
complement
their
solid
lineup
of
regular
beers
a
pleasant
suprise
for
sure
i
liked
the
integration
between
the
barrel
notes
and
regular
barleywine
flavors
in
this
while
still
a
bit
warm
and
a
steady
sipper
id
love
to
see
how
this
one
would
mellow
and
age
over
a
couple
of
years
overall
this
was
a
very
boozy
barlywine
way
different
from
the
previous
two
i
had
which
were
very
hoppy
if
you
can
find
this
it
is
worth
a
shot
but
have
some
good
buddies
to
share
it
with
somwhat
easy
to
drink
although
the
taste
of
the
alcohol
might
get
a
bit
overwhelming
if
a
lot
has
been
drank
overall
a
very
good
beer
worth
the
for
the
experience
overall
this
is
a
solid
barrelaged
barleywine
though
its
a
bit
short
of
spectacular
still
its
worth
a
shot
barleywine
style
ale
category
as
it
is
very
malt
dominated
try
some
if
you
see
some
the
appearance
on
this
naturally
carbonated
beauty
is
great
large
frothy
long
lasting
head
that
forms
fun
shapes
deep
amber
color
nose
is
light
but
shows
trace
amounts
of
whiskey
wood
and
malt
flavor
is
heavily
sweet
rich
deeply
malty
with
notes
of
caramel
and
toffee
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
graham
from
the
wood
a
lot
to
like
here
could
have
more
depth
and
concentration
but
is
nicely
balanced
for
the
style
rich
and
even
has
a
nice
finish
the
bottle
conditioning
makes
the
difference

update
had
this
on
tap
at
monks
kettle
and
it
was
much
better
than
the
bottled
version
none
of
the
cheese
and
it
was
wellcarbonated
id
give
it
a
4
3
overall
on
tap
good
beer
that
i
can
see
getting
a
whole
lot
better
with
some
age
seems
slightly
rough
around
the
edges
but
not
bad
at
all
in
fact
it
is
very
nice
and
very
drinkable
right
now
this
was
more
interesting
than
good
honestly
but
always
cool
to
try
an
11
year
old
beer
an
unimpressive
barleywine
didnt
even
bother
finishing
the
bottle
i
found
this
beer
to
be
overly
sour
and
musty
like
old
fruit
and
old
socks
sour
and
musty
complex
but
most
of
the
flavors
were
not
good
color
and
head
were
good
but
the
smell
matched
the
taste
overall
decent
enough
first
off
i
like
barley
wines
ive
had
a
few
different
brands
and
i
overall
like
the
style
old
howling
bastard
ohb
is
an
excellent
representative
of
the
style
i
agree
with
other
posters
here
that
there
are
better
barley
wines
out
there
but
this
is
a
great
brand
to
use
as
the
standard
representative
of
the
style
there
will
likely
be
better
brands
and
there
will
likely
be
worst
brands
depending
on
your
taste
but
the
ohb
is
a
great
balanced
everyday
barley
wine
suitable
for
most
palettes
an
extremely
enjoyable
beer
o
a
good
barleywine
it
has
been
awhile
since
i
have
had
a
barleywine
and
this
one
i
would
have
again
the
caramel
really
sells
me
on
this
beer
i
would
buy
this
again
and
wonder
how
different
it
was
fresh
so
now
after
about
a
dozen
or
so
barley
wines
i
have
find
another
one
that
i
have
liked
thats
two
for
me
o
this
was
a
rather
impressive
nonba
barleywine
that
has
a
great
balance
between
sweet
malty
flavors
and
the
fresh
hoppiness
found
in
some
barleywine
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
hoppy
barleywines
that
ive
had
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
barleywine
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
its
one
of
the
better
local
ones
ive
had
definitely
one
of
the
better
blue

beers
as
well

all
around
great

and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
for
the
abv
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
its
a
good
beer
much
better
than
their
oatmeal
stout
i
had
last
night
its
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smoothly
o
not
too
bad
worth
a
try
for
sure
tame
for
a
barleywine
so
it
would
be
a
good
beginner
brew
this
beer
is
a
chestnut
colored
liquid
with
a
very
slim
head
mostly
still
and
very
clear
the
aroma
is
of
malt
and
some
booze
the
taste
is
warming
sweet
and
had
a
firm
mid
taste
of
bitter
hops
resiny
hop
flavor
through
the
finish
sweet
full
in
body
a
good
but
not
great
barley
wine
nice
eggshell

head
melts
into
hazy
deep
copper
liquid
contained
in
the
appropriate
0
3l
victory
snifter
deep
doughybiscuity
sweetness
then
the
hop
makes
itself
known
in
the
nose
very
much
the
olde
englishe
style
wine
the
taste
is
long
and
complex
more
biscuity
notes
and
hefty
sweetness
here
hops
are
an
afterthought
yet
noticeably
felt
on
the
tongue
not
very
much
alcohol
detected
given
its
heft
finishes
long
and
warming
nice
interplay
of
hop
and
malt
malt
winning
out
very
nice
authentic
english
style
i
see
a
malt
bomb
here
with
cellaring
good
job
blue
point
o
a
decent
hoppy
barleywine
but
its
getting
a
bit
of
a
stale
feel
to
it
from
the
oxidation
creeping
in
very
nice
barleywine
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
hazy
reddishbrown
with
a
nice
finger
of
pale
white
head
aroma
about
ad
good
as
it
gets
fresh
baked
bread
with
a
hi
t
of
sweetness
and
alcohol
on
the
nose
fairly
similar
in
terms
of
taste
a
little
thick
but
deliciously
good
not
the
best
barleywine
style
ale
ive
had
but
pretty
high
on
the
list
the
taste
is
very
nice
and
i
was
surprised
by
how
delicious
the
beer
was
it
is
not
my
favorite
barleywine
but
it
is
certainly
an
upper
tier
barleywine
a
very
nice
bread
character
from
the
vienna
malt
and
a
nice
hop
presence
the
booze
is
not
overwhelming
and
overall
i
find
this
to
be
a
stellar
barleywine
o
pretty
good
barleywine
o
this
is
a
good
well
balanced
beer
it
is
a
good
representation
of
a
not
to
sweet
not
to
toasted
malty
barleywine
if
you
avoid
barleywines
for
the
sticky
sweetness
then
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
have
a
go
with
this
one
o
not
too
bad
by
any
means
pretty
solid
for
the
style
for
sure
overall
a
tasty
barleywine
dead
on
this
is
a
decent
barleywine
though
a
bit
thin
it
has
a
nice
hop
character
which
helps
to
counter
the
sweet
sugar
a
fuller
body
would
help
this
tremendously
but
i
enjoyed
it
nonetheless
after
the
beer
rested
there
was
a
taste
of
fruitiness
coming
through
o
great
local
product
right
there
with
other
good
american
barleywines
stopped
by
the
brewery
to
grab
some
swag
and
scope
out
old
howling
bastard
on
cask
and
was
pretty
surprised
that
i
have
no
review
on
this
one
asi
had
it
many
times
brew
showed
up
a
deep
amber
brown
with
a
thin
creamy
head
has
a
wonderful
caramel
nose
and
taste
the
body
is
super
creamy
as
i
would
expect
on
cask
cask
really
works
for
this
beer
there
is
a
subtle
bitterness
to
the
finish
that
is
just
right
one
of
my
fav
barleys
and
fav
local
beers
on
cask
gotta
love
it
what
a
treat
overall
a
fairly
drinkable
barleywine
with
a
complex
flavor
and
the
right
degree
of
booze
o
nothing
objectionable
here
but
the
oxidation
and
lack
of
hop
character
makes
me
wonder
how
long
the
keg
had
been
around
it
kicked
at
the
end
of
my
pour
recommended
to
try
but
doesnt
begin
to
compare
to
the
best
in
class
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
smells
sweet
caramel
notes
hops
are
present
great
ruby
color
nice
thick
tan
head
creamy
tastes
sweet
pretty
standard
barely
wine
very
boozy
alcohol
is
def
present
in
this
10
percenter
slightly
above
average
barely
wine
for
me
not
one
id
run
back
to
get
but
would
def
pick
up
if
i
couldnt
find
one
of
my
favs
on
hand
picked
up
a
bottle
and
poured
into
a
glass
pours
deep
rubycopper
with
a
thick
creamcolored
head
aroma
of
strong
caramel
and
cereal
and
a
lot
of
hops
flavor
about
the
same
a
little
sweet
smooth
texture
not
bad
but
nothing
really
sticks
out
and
the
alcohol
isnt
hidden
well
d
this
was
more
like
a
double
ipa
than
a
barleywine
but
it
had
a
nice
enough
scent
and
taste
the
body
was
only
ok
and
the
finish
could
have
been
smoother
so
it
wasnt
super
easy
to
drink
but
it
was
still
pretty
good
age
would
definitely
change
the
brew
although
i
cant
definitely
say
it
would
improve
beer
is
thin
and
sweet
with
a
lot
of
fruitiness
berry
flavors
in
the
beer
it
is
a
little
hot
finish
was
a
little
dry
i
dont
think
id
have
it
again
but
it
is
a
fine
barleywine
with
12
years
of
age
on
it
the
old
howling
bastard
has
evolved
into
an
extremely
complex
animal
its
complexity
combines
fruits
hops
and
sweet
candied
malts
into
one
highly
tantalizing
body
a
fantastic
representation
of
the
style
that
is
not
overly
sweet
or
boozy
but
rather
highly
balanced
and
robust
overall
a
respectable
middle
of
the
road
barley
wine
taste
is
not
too
shabby
really
the
caramel
and
toffe
are
very
prominent
so
is
the
alcohol
its
a
big
beer
not
too
sweet
and
has
plenty
of
bittering
hops
on
the
end
to
clean
things
up
nicely
mouthfeel
is
solid
not
too
thin
nor
is
it
syrupy
well
carbonated
its
one
of
those
beers
where
the
mouthfeel
is
never
mentioned
because
it
is
just
nice
and
flys
under
the
radar
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
like
it
id
be
more
than
happy
to
buy
this
one
again
a
good
sipper
old
howling
bastard
requires
a
commitment
but
is
worth
the
effort
find
a
fire
in
a
dark
room
and
settle
in
for
a
long
while
to
savor
overall
a
good
barleywine
sweet
but
balanced
thanks
to
the
hops
my
kind
of
barleywine
its
not
bad
but
it
comes
nowhere
close
to
many
ive
had
in
the
style
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
it
lacks
the
complexity
that
really
defines
the
style
for
me
o
a
big
brash
hoppedout
and
boozy
american
barleywine
this
brew
could
stand
a
couple
years
to
mellow
at
10
abv
its
an
attainable
feat
but
may
not
even
be
worth
it
depending
how
the
craft
holds
up
i
like
blue
point
but
wouldnt
put
it
past
them
to
just
have
created
a
big
bold
sorta
onedimensional
barleywine
like
old
howling
bastard
overall
my
second
favorite
bluepoint
beer
no
its
not
a
bad
thing
i
can
drink
this
all
day
pretty
good
stuff
and
honestly
if
you
havent
had
it
have
it
cheers
to
all
medium
bodied
with
mediumish
carbonation
it
has
a
good
mouthfeel
and
the
10abv
is
well
hidden
a
very
nice
brew
indeed
o
a
solid
barley
wine
that
i
suspect
would
be
even
better
with
some
age
on
the
bottle
o
it
was
just
ok
to
me
ive
had
a
lot
of
blue
point
beers
and
i
love
the
brewery
but
this
one
just
didnt
hit
the
mark
for
me
its
a
decent
barleywine
but
i
feel
it
needed
more
weight
to
truly
elevate
itself
o
damn
near
perfect
the
bottle
cap
says
10th
anniversary
9909
so
im
wondering
if
this
had
been
sitting
around
for
a
couple
of
years
developing
into
this
ive
always
loved
this
once
a
year
brew
but
this
one
tonight
damn
very
good
seek
it
out
this
is
a
good
beer
and
thats
really
where
it
sits
nothing
stands
out
obviously
bad
about
it
but
theres
nothing
that
really
sets
it
apart
either
a
ruddy
brownish
color
small
head
forms
and
dissipates
hoppy
citrus
aroma
bright
hop
notes
honey
sugary
malts
in
the
flavor
profile
oily
piney
resinous
hops
and
barleywine
like
flavor
from
the
malt
toffee
sugary
malt
solid
hop
bitterness
throughout
a
big
beer
but
achieves
balance
small
alcohol
presence
for
such
a
big
beer
overall
if
you
like
a
good
hoppy
barleywine
this
could
be
for
you
this
beer
was
pretty
impressive
i
thought
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
dark
clear
looking
brown
color
the
head
was
large
at
first
but
settled
pretty
quick
the
smell
of
the
beer
didnt
remind
me
too
much
of
a
typical
barely
wine
it
was
a
little
fruity
on
the
nose
the
taste
was
a
little
boozy
but
very
warming
the
flavors
of
some
dark
fruits
some
sugary
notes
really
shine
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thick
and
smooth
overall
i
enjoy
this
barley
wine
quite
a
bit
and
would
enjoy
having
it
again
one
day
o
after
a
few
of
these
you
just
might
find
yourself
howling
ala
the
name
decent
example
but
ill
stop
there
appears
easy
at
first
but
doesnt
go
down
without
a
fight
really
beautiful
looking
barleywine
dark
copperreddish

massive

dried

sweetcloying
nice

and
well
balanced
with
the
malts
candied

prune
great
flavors
excellent
brew
right
here
i
will
seek
this
out
again
and
pick
some
up
to
age
o
this
beer
is
good
honestly
this
is
one
of
the
best
most
well
balanced
barley
wines
ive
ever
had
with
some
interesting
flavors
mixed
in
i
think
this
beer
needs
more
respect
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
appreciated
the
combination
of
great
brewery
execution
and
bolder
more
creative
flavors
poured

this

o

i
probably
wont
buy
again
but
maybe
a
bottle
to
age
a
bit
and
try
again
overall
i
think
i
would
prefer
a
fresher
bottle
seems
like
there
is
something
not
quite
right
with
this
bottle
what
with
the
tanginess
it
doesnt
seemed
to
have
improved
with
age
overall
an
average
beer
that
im
still
glad
i
tried
cheers
o
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
considering
its
strength
because
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
from
the
taste
overall
nothing
bad
just
nothing
of
note
indistinguishable
malt
flavors
and
some
hop
bitterness
i
really
didnt
have
any
trouble
finish
both
of
my
snifters
though
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
dark
fruit
and
small
oak
hints
in
the
taste
dark
fruits
and
hints
of
licorice
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
dark
fruit
aftertaste
not
boozy
nice
small
oak
decent
a
bit
creamy
on
the
mouth
really
not
a
bad
beer
in
anyway
but
id
prefer
a
bit
of
hops
somewhere
in
this
rather
strong
and
rich
flavor
profile
o
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
solid
barleywine
it
has
a
very
nice
balance
of
rich
malty
sweetness
and
bitterness
from
the
hops
d
the
booze
and
bitterness
slow
you
down
a
bit
d
this
is
one
drinkable
barleywine
you
can
barely
taste
the
alcohol
with
each
sip
although
its
very
sweet
old
howling
bastard
is
a
drinkable
beer
overall
awesome
beer
i
would
recommend
this
to
any
beer
drinker
big
thanks
as
always
to
the
great
mclk
thanks
a
ton
mark
i
am
so
glad
you
moved
down
here
bottle
pours
copper
with
light
haze
with
gold
hues
and
light

the
aroma
has
smooth
dark
to
musty
fruit
notes
and
seem
to
bleed
into
a
rye
like
spiciness
hops
spiciness
full
thick
malty
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
heat
at
the
end
of
the
draw
the
taste
seems
a
bit
organic
and
grassy
moving
into
thick
chewy
malt
sweetness
pine
hop
bitterness
a
touch
of
pine
hop
flavor
and
grapefruit
it
gets
smooth
and
a
bit
grainy
into
the
finish
setting
up
a
very
pleasing
finish
it
leaves
pine
hops
and
fading
yet
faint
sludgy
sweet
malts
deep
into
the
after
taste
nice
beer
a
good
ending
to
our
super
bowl
meal
220z
bomber
this
one
pours
hazy
orangishamber
color
there
was
very
little
of
a
just
slightly
tan
head
on
it
it
left
a
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
nice
definitely
a
lot
of
malts
but
some
fruit
notes
popping
up
mainly
apricots
and
orange
some
earthy
notes
also
the
taste
is
also
good
there
is
a
dryness
and
very
subdued
sweetness
to
this
one
some
caramel
toffee
plus
faint
plums
and
raisins
alcohol
is
not
evident
in
the
flavor
profile
i
bought
this
for
the
name
but
will
buy
it
again
for
the
taste
old
howling
bastard
may
be
the
result
but
seductive
pirate
wench
or
viking
thunder
goddess
seem
like
more
appropriate
titles
i
that
some
have
aged
this
2
years
or
more
but
at
about
the
one
year
anniversary
i
find
it
to
be
just
about
perfect
i
like
my
barleywine
punchy
though
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
brew
definitely
not
anywhere
near
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
but
a
solid
one
definitely
good
to
try
if
you
like
the
style
if
you
dont
like
barleywines
then
you
probably
wont
like
this
d
good
overall
this
beer
was
drinkable
and
even
somewhat
interesting
but
not
really
noteworthy
its
cold
outside
and
this
beer
is
just
about
perfect
for
the
occasion
its
very
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
drinkability
is
affected
by
the
alcohol
presence
a
slow
sipper
i
split
the
bottle
and
half
is
just
about
right
i
usually
dont
age
barleywines
but
this
one
would
probably
be
totally
awesome
with
the
alcohol
tamed
the
beer
pours
a
deep
redamber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
warm
caramel
scent
that
indicative
a
slow
sipper
beer
its
not
especially
hoppy
or
complex
buts
its
solid
and
well
done
mostly
caramelized
pale
malts
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
dry
malty
flavor
thats
slow
going
down
yet
quite
enjoyable
and
delicious
again
not
especially
hoppy
but
well
brewed
and
malt
forward
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
its
smooth
and
easy
drinking
an
excellent
winter
warmer
drinkabilty
this
beer
isnt
hard
to
drink
at
all
though
you
can
certainly
notice
the
kick
of
heat
at
the
end
its
an
okay
beer
but
not
one
i
would
buy
again
because
for
me
to
sit
and
drink
a
10
percent
beer
it
better
have
a
decent
complexity
just
kind
of
a
bland
blah
run
of
the
mill
barley
wine
dont
want
to
beat
it
up
to
bad
cuz
its
not
offensive
but
just
another
let
down
from
a
brewery
thats
never
done
much
to
this
point
to
impress
me
drinks
fairly
easy
i
would
love
to
try
some
fresher
for
comparison
purposes
d
really
just
ok
for
me
probably
wont
revisit
this
one
drinkability
is
low
for
a
regular
beer
yet
high
for
a
barleywine
as
this
is
a
slow
sipper
and
but
not
one
to
drink
all
night
tasty
but
one
to
drink
with
caution
as
the
abv
will
creep
up
on
you
it
went
great
with
the
lamb
stew
that
i
had
for
dinner
complimenting
it
like
a
wine
d
this
is
a
rough
beer
there
is
booze
sharp
hops
and
astringency
d
an
ok
barleywine
smelled
very
good
but
the
booze
came
out
a
little
too
much
in
the
taste
also
a
bit
too
carbonated
probably
wouldnt
get
again
10oz
serving
at
the
devils
den
off
the
tap
old
howling
bastard
has
a
light
golden
with
amber
spots
in
the
color
and
the
white
foam
reached
an
inch
with
some
froth
and
a
bubbly
look
not
much
lace
in
the
nose
i
sensed
a
strong
amber
ale
a
note
of
caramel
malt
and
some
light
fruit
such
as
apples
a
bit
of
alcohol
too
overall
not
that
interesting
tastes
include
sweet
malt
caramel
earthy
hops
and
some
alcohol
not
that
much
going
on
feel
is
nearing
full
bodied
and
the
carb
is
very
low
im
glad
i
tried
this
off
the
tap
before
grabbing
a
big
bottle
its
pretty
tame
for
a
american
barleywine
averageplus
drinkability
and
overall
a
solid
barleywine
if
nothing
to
write
home
to
yo
mama
about
its
caramel
driven
but
not
overly
sweet
d
this
is
a
pretty
hoppy
american
barleywine
which
may
make
you
think
of
double
ipas
but
the
line
is
thin
there
anyway
the
malt
backbone
is
there
giving
a
sufficiently
full
malty
anchor
this
is
very
tasty
i
would
recommend
this
and
i
would
like
to
see
what
is
like
in
the
bottle
after
a
short
aging
this
is
a
fruity
bw
if
youre
looking
for
a
fruity
bw
that
is
high
in
abv
that
is
not
raw
and
you
dont
mind
the
bit
of
thinness
of
the
body
certainly
grab
this
one
my
gut
instinct
on
aging
this
would
doubt
it
but
just
a
guess
anyway
might
not
fit
style
guidelines
the
way
it
should
but
i
would
say
this
is
an
interesting
bw
that
should
be
checked
out
d
not
bad
but
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
needed
to
be
more
balanced
i
think
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
it
has
been
waiting
to
jump
onto
my
taste
buds
and
pops
a
bit
right
at
the
end
a
reall
wonderful
beer
had
this
again
on
915
a
little
better
this
time
i
would
recommend
it
on
a
cold
winter
day
a
very
underwhelming
barleywine
i
cant
see
any
reason
to
get
this
over
the
many
amazing
american
barleywines
available
today
all
that
said
its
not
a
terrible
beer
the
musty
leathery
note
with
the
roasted
malt
that
emerges
at
first
is
quite
good
and
the
mild
sweetness
that
the
beer
ends
on
is
bland
for
a
barleywine
but
has
more
character
than
a
lot
of
other
beers
also
while
this
definitely
doesnt
stand
up
to
just
being
sipped
and
savored
it
went
rather
well
with
the
garlic
pizza
i
ended
up
pairing
it
with
i
wouldnt
refuse
this
beer
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
d
very
good
barleywine
the
sugar
makes
it
all
worthwhile
d
pretty
drinkable
this
was
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
even
mouthfeel
a
tad
slick
tingly
carbonation
finish
slight
warming
of
the
cheeks
tasty
beer
could
use
a
bit
more
complexity
d
really
wonderful
but
strong
great
drinkability
for
what
it
is
but
would
be
limited
due
to
abv
and
sweetness
really
a
sipper
though
even
12oz
was
tough
by
end
this
review
is
for
a
2003
bottle
consumed
late
this
summer
at
a
tasting
poured
a
light
amber
with
almost
no
head
the
aroma
is
exhibits
a
beer
that
still
has
quite
a
bit
of
punch
and
with
some
classic
sweet
barley
wine
notes
no
oxidation
the
taste
is
similar
but
does
show
some
light
oxidized
notes
of
sherry
and
bandaid
there
is
also
a
bit
of
woodiness
but
overall
still
quite
drinkable
and
fairly
pleasant
a
bit
past
its
prime
but
amazingly
still
a
huge
beer
sampled
at
the
2009

d
its
not
overly
enticing
but
its
easily
approachable
d
had
a
pint
of
this
over
two
glasses
went
down
nicely
really
nice
beer
i
have
been
enjoying
their
cask
offerings
as
of
late
drinkability
a
fine
respectable
barleywine
at
least
at
five
years
out
tasted
this
on
tap
and
served
in
a
goblet
it
has
an
unexpected
strong
aroma
of
pineapple
and
even
tastes
slightly
like
the
fruit
sweet
and
syrupy
mouthfeel
was
fine
fruity
flavor
helped
cut
the
strong
alcohol
taste
and
made
this
very
drinkable
this
is
a
fullbodied
smooth
tasty
that
does
cloy
as
the
tasting
goes
on
that
does
not
hamper
the
drinkability
though
as
barley
wines
can
be
lovely
this
beer
is
a
total
winter
sipper
but
for
me
always
enjoyable
a
very
different
barley
wine
very
smokey
in
the
middle
and
finish
with
a
meaty
appetite
earthy
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
spice
toffee
and
caramel
with
some
fig
date
prune
oxidtaion
brown
sugar
and
peach
hiding
behind
the
smokey
flavors
a
bitter
finish
on
the
piney
side
a
good
odd
barley
wine
750ml
capped
bottle
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
some
reddish
highlights
the
head
was
almost
nonexistant
and
settled
into
a
light
ring
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
aged
grassy
hops
and
a
noticable
alcohol
aroma
a
nice
big
hoppy
blast
kicks
things
off
the
hops
seem
to
be
aged
and
have
grassy
woody
and
citrus
characteristics
not
a
very
strong
malt
presence
and
there
is
a
noticable
alcohol
flavor
the
feel
is
light
with
rather
soft
carbonation
finishes
sweet
and
slick
with
some
alcohol
burn
a
hoppy
brew
with
plenty
of
alcohol
presence
a
decent
drinker
this
is
one
of
those
barleywines
that
grab
you
by
the
palate
and
wont
let
you
go
its
intensely
sweet
a
touch
bitter
and
very
alcoholic
its
incredibly
thick
and
a
definite
sipper
overall
this
is
a
real
bully
of
a
beer
but
its
right
on
target

thats

a
small

the
folks
brought
to
holiday
valley
beer
wine
festival
in
ellicottville
ny
a
couple
of
years
ago
imo
it
stoled
the
show
judging
by
the
looks
of
the
waxing
over
the
cap
and
dried
lines
of
the
product
all
over
the
top
of
the

id
assume
that
there
were
some
bottling

this
one
pours
clear
and
a
light
shade
of
amber
color
with
a
wispy
thin
white
head
thats
gone
in
a
flash
not
a

of

going
on
quite
a
bit
of
light
colored
sediment
settled
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
i
like
the
smell
but
its
a
little
off
you
get
some
of
the
10
abv
right
off
the
bat
but
it
also
has
a
rich
sweet
caramel
malty
character
as
well
there
is
an
unlikely
corn
starch
piece
also
this
one
seems
under
carbonated
and
lighter
in
the
mouth
than
you
might
think
from
the
nose
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
whiskey
in
the
flavor
that
over
powers
the
caramel
taste
some
definitely
a
sipper
im
glad
that
they

some
neat

i
remember
enjoying
the

good

keep
this

this
is
a
decent
barleywine
but
i
have
to
say
ive
had
many
better
a
very
respectable
barley
wine
perhaps
not
worth
the
16
99
i
paid
for
it
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
the
alcohol
made
its
presence
known
but
was
more
warming
then
anything
combined
with
the
weighed
down
feel
consistancy
of
the
beer
ten
ounces
was
more
then
enough
for
me
to
enjoy
all
in
all
a
nice
barley
wine
that
deserves
some
attention
first
off
this

not

it
never
was

with
minimal

aroma
is
syrupy
sweet
with
whiffs
of
alcohol
flavor
starts
with
the
sweet
maltiness
then
it
gets
kind
of
ugly
a
flash
of
bitter
hoppiness
turns
into
some
sort
of
longlasting
plasticy
bitterness
that
just
wont
go
away
coupled
with
substantial
alcohol
burn
the
alcohol
part
wouldnt
be
such
a

if
the

sorry

mouthfeel

suffer
from
the

fate
dont
know
if
the
wax
was
part
of
the
culprit
or
what
but
im
not
very
excited
about
finishing
the
bottle
maybe
itll
grow
on
me
very
well
received
i
paired
this
up
with
cracker
barrel
extra
sharp
white
cheese
and
it
worked
incredible
with
this
brew
a
solid
barleywine
overall
very
nice
to
sip
and
quite
mellow
after
sitting
for
three
years
maybe
a
tad
overpriced
at
17
but
i
enjoyed
it
just
the
same
if
you
have
the
chance
check
this
out
hats
off
to
blue
point
brewery
for
making
this
caliber
style
of
beer
well
this
was
interesting
looks
a
dark
red
with
a
shot
head
smells
a
little
smokey
and
sweet
my
first
taste
sure
surprised
me
i
was
expecting
american
barley
wine
and
my
first
flavor
was
smoked
cheddar
ah
yes
its
a
smoked
barley
wine
recommend
for
fans
of
smoked
beer
and
bas
looking
for
something
a
little
different
on
tap
at
the
pizza
plant
on
transitso
i
asked
the
bartender
the
style
of
this
beer
he
says
well
its
categorized
as
a
barley
wine
but
he
thinks
its
a
beefed
up
rauchbier
so
isaid
hmm
a
knowledgable
barkeep
kinda
hard
to
come
by
poured
into
the
goblet
a
slight
hazed
light
amber
with
a
thinner
white
headcherry
wood
aromas
big
on
the
smoke
with
some
dark
fruit
as
well
now
this
beer
has
a
big
smokeywoody
profile
like
the
before
mentioned
soaked
cherry
wood
with
some
brown
sugar
and
raisin
quality
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
unique
to
say
the
least
if
you
like
smokeywoody
flavors
this
is
for
you
iam
glad
i
tried
it
it
is
very
unique
in
my
opinion
note
this
beer
is
listed
as
retired
but
i
picked
up
this
growler
at
the
brewery
just
three
weeks
ago
i
shared
a
2003
edition
after
christmas
dinner
with
my
bro
and
cousin
as
we
did
several
other
good
beers
this
beer
poured
a
nice
honey
bright
color
with
a
thick
head
and
little
carbonation
you
can
pick
up
some
nice
fruit
notes
in
the
smell
of
the
bastard
the
taste
is
nice
and
hoppy
and
spicy
but
definitely
paletable
it
was
a
nice
beer
to
have
at
christmas
time
with
the
warming
sensation
of
the
nigh
alcohol
content
a
bit
pricey
where
i
got
it
happy
deli
in
nyc
at
25
a
bottle
but
i
was
willing
to
spend
it
because
i
cant
really
get
it
in
pa
i
felt
somewhat
better
when
i
went
into
the
happy
deli
3
weeks
after
buying
my
bottle
and
the
price
was
up
to
30
didnt
realize
beer
inflation
was
higher
than
other
goods
and
services
beer
is
good

as
i
was
trying
to
get
the

off

start
deep
copper
to
amber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
nose
is
very
fruity
mild
citrus
tangerine
with
sherry
vanilla
and
caramel
notes
weird
flavor
almost
smoky
there
is
little
of
the
citrus
in
the
taste
the
vanilla
an
sherry
notes
are
compounded
it
doesnt
say
on
the
bottle
but
im
guessing
this
has
been
on
oak
for
a
few
months
it
softens
the
hops
but
the
oak
and
smoke
doesnt
blend
well
with
this
beer
it
does
have
a
nice
soft
mouth
feel
and
the
oak
really
tames
the
alcohol
but
it
just
seems
a
little
off
immediate
above
may
be
something
else
and
i
will
over
those
words
over
and
the
3
7
when
i
verify
on
tap
and
cask
at
mugs
in
ny
schweet
very
dark
and
clear
amber
rubied
but
you
can
see
through
it
this
bit
of
lovliness
came
to
me
served
in
an
english
pint
what
a
way
to
start
out
our
pubhopping
huge
khaki
creamy
frothy
head
sitting
over
a
half
inch
high
smooth
and
silky
just
glides
over
your
tongue
sweet
and
orangey
deeply
malty
caramel
sweetness
nice
hoppiness
not
too
strong
heavy
or
intense
at
all
one
of
my
buds
said
it
seemed
like
a
triple
ipa
really
enjoyed
this
one
was
glad
to
have
stumbled
onto
it
after
wondering
about
the
17
bottle
i
just
passed
over
about
a
half
hour
before
hitting
this
so
far
one
of
my
best
barley
wine
experiences
apparently
a
filtered
beer
the
old
howling
bastard
pours
a
crystalclear
orangeish
amber
body
with
a
crimson
cast
beneath
a
full
head
of
frothy
offwhite
lace
that
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
some
very
nice
spiderweblike
lacing
about
the
glass
the
nose
is
more
intriguing
than
captivating
with
a
hint
of
apricot
amidst
a
mildly
sweet
and
toasty
grainy
maltiness
amidst
some
medicinal
and
subtly
smoky
notes
notes
that
are
oddly
compelling
think
islay
whiskey
in
fact
i
wonder
if
theres
some
peat
smoked
malt
in
there
across
the
tongue
and
down
the
throat
the
bastard
seems
more
like
a
tame
old
kitty
cat
slick
and
smooth
and
ready
for
a
nap
its
only
lightly
creamy
but
its
full
body
is
pillowy
smooth
aggressive
in
its
flavor
a
blend
of
bready
and
subtly
crusty
bread
with
a
touch
of
apricot
marmalade
drawn
across
the
top
is
all
but
overshadowed
by
its
smokiness
bold
bitterness
clearly
noticeable
alcohol
and
leafy
and
fruity
hop
flavor
theres
some
pineapple
and
perhaps
watermelon
i
wonder
if
theyre
using
some
nugget
hops
theres
alot
in
there
and
yet
it
all
kindof
blends
together
and
the
hops
and
bitterness
eventually
overwhelm
the
maltiness
almost
altogether
it
finishes
dry
wipeddown
with
alcohol
and
somewhat
astringent
with
rogue
smokiness
some
leafy
citrusy
hop
flavor
and
some
delicate
malt
that
sticks
in
the
mouth
within
a
few
sips
it
starts
to
build
upon
the
palate
greatly
reducing
its
drinkability
and
numbing
the
tastebuds
still
its
lingering
character
not
unlike
its
nose
can
be
intriguing
the
bottle
states
that
the
vintage
is
2003
and
that
its
good
in
2004
better
in
2005
and
awesome
in
2006
i
guess
i
should
have
waited
a
year
or
two
even
this
is
the
only
barley
wine
i
have
every
tried
and
chances
are
it
will
be
the
last
some
people
love
this
stuff
not
me
not
my
taste
buds
it
is
a
good
novelty
item
with
a
good
story
behind
the
name
but
just
not
up
mmy
alley
the
bottle
and
art
work
are
great
i
would
suggest
only
trying
this
as
a
novelty
or
if
you
really
love
the
taste
of
barley
amber
body
with
offwhite
head
intense
aroma
of
malty
sweet
flavors
that
are
not
too
well
blended
honey
maple
sweet
smokey
and
light
hops
are
hidden
behind
the
massive
malty
alcohol
very
sweet
palate
alcoholic
and
moderately
astringent
poorly
balanced
a
smooth
medium
body
keeps
it
from
being
a
waste
a
poormans
barleywine
that
is
very
expensive
on
cask
at
the
g
man
in
nyc
dark
brown
with
a
fluffy
white

nice
roasted

hoppy
and
yeasty

bready
whole
wheat

notes
alcohol
fairly
prominant
medium
bodied
very
smooth
mouth
feel
hops
a
bit
muted
could
use
some
more
ibus
to
balance
things
out
i
tried
this
one
after
the
arrogant
bastard
so
it
might
have
been
a
tough
act
to
follow
the
cask
pour
seemed
somewhat
mushy
in
the
overall
balance
of
this
brew
sampled
from
a
growler
filled
up
from
a
firkin
malty
nose
little
head
which
doesnt
last
too
long
big
malty
flavour
and
alcohol
warmth
malt
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
some
hops
are
there
too
very
smooth
and
quite
an
easy
drinker
quite
rich
but
not
as
much
as
other
barleywines
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
i
decided
to
try
this
very
appealing
ale
how
could
one
not
given
its
name
nice
copper
hazy
color
with
a
white
laced
head
it
had
a
nice
aroma
sort
of
caramel
and
flowery
bitterness
not
overpowering
in
smell
or
in
taste
although
it
was
quite
tasty
a
smooth
but
bitter
kick
at
first
and
then
it
mellows
out
a
little
cookie
or
biscut
like
very
enjoyable
and
rich
although
not
heavy
a
perfect
beer
to
sit
by
the
fire
after
dinner
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
as
it
warms
more
of
the
ale
like
flavors
settle
and
the
hoppiness
relaxes
as
well
as
with
other
bas
who
reiewed
this
beer
my
only
knock
it
that
it
is
very
overpriced
i
paid
16
for
750
ml
not
worth
that
much
even
if
it
is
this
good
cheers
overall
a
solid
example
of
an
american
barleywine
o
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
checked
the
bottle
best
before
stamp
it
had
two
numbers
on
it
2
years
apart
should
of
been
in
the
clear
might
need
another
look
if
a
new
shipment
comes
in
fyi
everyone
i
am
reviewing
this
from
norway
and
there
has
been
a
mistake
on
the
label
this
is
actually
an
imperial
ipa
i
think
it
is
an
excellent
beer
i
dont
really
care
about
how
many
fingers
and
color
etc
i
care
about
the
taste
i
must
say
for
an
ipa
the
2
captains
also
a
nøgne
is
closer
to
the
mark
for
an
ipa
however
this
beer
is
so
awesome
i
cant
help
but
rate
it
high
the
nose
is
almost
non
existent
even
in
a
large
wine
glass
but
the
mouth
feel
is
awesome
the
bittering
and
flavoring
hops
are
fantastic
i
cant
help
but
wonder
what
would
happen
if
a
huge
pile
of
the
right
hops
where
added
to
this
recipe
in
the
last
few
minutes
of
the
boil
it
reminds
me
of
the
dog
fish
head
ipa
line
but
better
bravo
again
too
bad
nøgne
has
been
sold
to
a
big
player
or
maybe
not
too
bad
brown
and
hazy
with
a
small
tan
head
aroma
is
sweet
malts
with
brown
sugar
flavor
is
sweet
rich
malt
thats
nicely
supported
by
a
moderate
bitterness
the
malts
definitely
lead
but
the
hops
show
its
american
influence
a
creamy
silky
feel
with
a
nice
low
carbonation
im
not
a
big
barleywine
fan
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
o
rich

striking
a
surprisingly
nice
balance
between
hop

and

nicely
drinkable
10
this
one
is
a
winner
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
a
bit
pricy
at
8
99
for
a
16
ouncer
but
still
a
very
satisfying
beer
a
rather
pleasant
barleywine
the

mustiness
doing
more
for
this
than
any
particular

not
that
the
latters
efforts
arent
appreciated
i
could
do
with
seeing
this
a
tad
earlier
in
the
hops
lives
but
can
hardly
see
why
aging
this
would
be
worthwhile
its
so
well
rounded
right
now
pretty
solid
brew
with
a
well
hidden
10
waiting
to
kick
your
ass
still
pretty
hoppy
for
a
bw
and
the
malt
has
some
dark
notes
that
i
dont
think
works
against
it
but
leaves
something
unique
in
your
glass
not
only
am
i
going
to
grab
one
for

going

quite
easy

and
worth
coming
back
to
the
first
glass
poured
a
dark
chestnut
brown
while
the
second
glass
was
just
as
dark
but
hazier
as
well
tastes
of
dark
fruits
with
breaded
malt
and
a
slight
roasted
chocolate
to
go
with
the
hops
in
the
finish
for
being
a
big
beer
at
10
it
does
drink
pretty
good
as
there
is
no
alcohol
burn
but
your
body
definately
feels
it
a
good
barleywine
overall
o
a
tasty
brew
and
one
of
my
favourites
from
this
brewery
super
glad
to
have
had
an
opportunity
to
try
it
incredibly
drinkable
whose
abv
goes
almost
unnoticed
this
is
a
good
hop
forward
barleywine
lots
of
complexity
and
a
unique
hop
profile
the
only
drawback
is
the
immodest
alcohol
taste
understandable
for
the
abv
but
many
others
have
done
much
better
still
though
this
is
a
great
winter
sipper
worth
a
try
for
sure
ointeresting
version
of
a
barley
wine
im
not
accustomed
to
appears
dark
but
tastes
light
and
at
10
the
abv
is
well
hidden
in
the
taste
though
i
can
feel
the
effects
i
do
like
this
brew
but
it
is
an
expensive
one
overall
lots
of
different
flavours
going
on
and
i
can
feel
the
booze
almost
instantly
this
is
a
really
good
barley
wine
that
i
hope
gets
even
better
with
age
i
tucked
a
few
bottles
away
to
see
how
it
develops
overall
pretty
solid
barleywine
here
folks
the
smokey
tobacco
and
leather
characteristics
give
this
beer
a
twist
on
what
i
am
normally
used
to
from
the
style
found
at
the
lcbo
by
accident
and
was
quite
surprised
poured
a
dark
and
hazy
brown
was
a
decent
head
for
10
smell
was
slightly
malty
but
the
hop
aroma
overwhelmed
it
the
taste
was
slight
malt
on
the
fore
front
and
then
the
bitter
hop
on
the
end
was
expecting
more
malt
but
was
still
a
good
brew
i
prefer
less
hoppy
beer
but
can
respect
a
well
made
and
balanced
hopped
dark
ale
pretty
good
beer
from
a
brewery
that
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
o
overall
a
good
barley
wine
with
a
different
flavor
profile
than
my
usual
american
west
coast
style
smooth
and
tasty
4
0
d
with
the
added
hop
emphasis
to
lighten
up
the
beer
a
bit
and
with
less
of
the
standard
boozy
taste
this
is
something
i
could
have
on
a
regular
basis
everything
is
well
orchestrated
and
the
end
product
is
delicious
great
brew
will
get
again
while
its
here
a
big
beer
with
a
deceivingly
mild
character
i
was
expecting
to
be
hammered
with
malt
sweetness
and
a
strong
boozy
taste
but
this
one
came
across
quite
easy
drinking
compared
to
many
other
offerings
from
the
northern
europe
regions
perhaps
this
all
came
from
letting
the
bottle
sit
for
most
of
the
year
in
a
relatively
temperate
environment
but
no
matter
what
this
is
one
fine
and
approachable
big
beer
overall
a
good
barleywine
very
enjoyable
criminal
law
penalizes
conspiracy
as
a
separate
crime
because
it
acknowledges
that
the
whole
can
be
bigger
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
multiple
actors
achieve
greater
results
working
in
concert
than
when
they
each
act
alone
indeed
that
is
the
case
with
nogne
100
where
sugary
nectarsweet
malts
collude
with
herbal
piny
hops
to
scheme
a
beer
as
satiating
as
it
is
quenching
teamwork
at
its
finest
a
good
barleywine
but
hardly
worth
the
hype
i
dont
think
its
nothing
special
pours
a
redish
whiskey
color
with
a
moderate
but
quicly
fleeting
off
white
head
the
nose
is
alcohol
old
wood
dried
red
fruit
and
caramel
malts
in
excess
flavor
is
mostly
similar
to
the
nose
lots
of
sweetness
up
front
but
it
doesnt
last
thankfully
that
molasses
spice
stays
around
but
the
sugar
goes
to
alcohol
before
too
long
also
a
surprising
level
of
hops
in
the
finish
of
this
which
makes
it
more
american
to
me
than
anything
average
mouthfeel
light
carbonation
lesser
body
than
most
long
finish
boozed
up
i
like
it
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
as
wonderful
or
unique
to
me
overall
this
is
one
of
the
stranger
barleywines
on
the
market
and
the
overabundance
of
raisin
and
dark
fruit
esters
is
initially
shocking
and
can
be
slightly
wearing
over
time
like
trying
to
eat
an
entire
loaf
of
spiced
fruitcake
in
one
sitting
the
beer
is
definitely
worth
trying
for
the
experience
but
be
aware
that
this
is
very
much
a
sipping
beer
and
the
strong
flavors
and
heavy
alcohol
burn
might
prove
too
much
for
some
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
barleywine
worth
drinking
for
a
while
overall
a
bit
too
dry
takes
away
drinakbility
one
of
the
slowest
drinks
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
says
a
lot
this
one
was
pretty
goddamn
intense
but
in
very
good
way
my
traveling
companion
couldnt
swallow
a
single
sip
but
i
finished
it
with
troubling
alacrity
considering
its
strength
a
great
barleywine
more
in
line
with
the
english
style
than
american
big
malt
of
course
loads
of
caramelized
sugar
dried
fruits
and
shortbread
bitterness
stands
its
ground
against
the
malt
blitz
hops
are
earthy
spicy
and
freshly
bitter
a
hint
of
fruit
from
the
yeast
softens
the
thick
flavors
nice
dryness
keeps
it
superdrinkable
yeah
this
would
do
the
trick
in
a
cold
scandinavian
winter
but
its
equally
good
at
standing
up
to
a
thick
ribeye
steak
o
while
i
wouldnt
call
it
complex
i
would
say
it
has
gravitas
and
is
satisfying
reminds
me
a
little
of
an
english
strong
ale
i
would
be
happy
if
you
gave
me
one
of
these
but
i
will
probably
not
buy
another
as
i
look
for
the
really
interesting
stuff
out
there
picked
this
up
while
on
vacation
in
oslo
murky
brown
pour
with
hints
of
mahogany
when
held
to
the
light
nice
creamy
one
finger
head
with
super
retention
and
crazy
lacing
huge
complex
nose
that
starts
off
all
hops
but
opens
up
with
tons
of
sweet
malts
and
citrus
the
taste
really
stands
out
in
the
barleywine
category
im
not
typically
a
big
fan
but
this
one
has
awesome
balance
very
complex
with
hints
of
rye
tangerines
caramel
hop
resin
pine
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
its
big
and
bold
but
not
overdone
like
most
barleywines
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
but
creamy
at
the
same
time
this
is
probably
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
going
to
continue
to
check
out
this
great
brewery
o
rough
and
not
entirely
well
balanced
but
a
great
tasting
beer
all
the
same
for
and
american
barley
wine
i
find
it
lacking
in
the
hops
department
and
would
have
perfected
more
hop
bang
although
the
malts
overpowered
the
hops
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
definitely
drink
again
warming
and
great
for
sipping
overall
a
bad
bottle
im
sure
but
its
the
only
one
of
these
ive
ever
had
so
this
is
how
ill
review
it
a
drainpour
but
it
isnt
the
worst
infected
bottle
ive
sipped
i
can
say
that
its
not
terrible
but
the
hops
dont
really
stand
out
terrible
mouthfeel
makes
it
suffer
i
could
pass
this
one
up
d
quite
the
solid
barleywine
here
nogne
has
really
been
hit
or
miss
with
me
with
what
i
have
tried
from
them
thus
far
but
this
one
is
a
successful
one
great
on
this
bitterchilly
night
pours
a
brownish
body
with
quick
dying
head
and
minor
lace
patches
aroma
is
malt
strong
as
i
pick
up
yeastbread
light
chocolate
caramel
touch
of
roasted
malts
and
a
medicinal
hoppy
aroma
light
to
mediumbodied
smooth
the
matls
are
prevelant
as
there
is
a
dry
yeasty
almost
woody
edge
with
chocolate
malt
sweetness
all
balanced
with
crisp
citric
hops
that
pucker
the
tongue
and
give
off
a
dry
finish
that
is
also
complemented
by
a
cameo
from
the
alochol
to
warm
you
up
easy
to
drink
relaxing
and
a
wellbalanced
brew
that
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
a
while
oseeing
it
poured
into
a
glass
had
me
excited
but
flavor
at
this
time
was
a
let
down
i
am
going
to
age
this
beer
for
five
years
and
see
how
it
mellows

aromas
are
a

odd

it
had
nice

i
would
like
to
pick
up
a
younger
bottle
in
the
future
do
solid
interpretation
from
nøgne
ø
glad
they
brought
it
back
and
at
a
nice
price
point
9
to
boot
would
buy
again
recommend
for
barleywine
lovers
approachable
despite
the
rich
dark
malt
backbone
feels
like
it
warrants
a
more
interesting
and
adventurous
hop
profile
though
o
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
that
capably
straddles
the
fence
separating
the
english
and
american
variants
of
the
style
though
it
is
somewhat
closer
to
the
latter
than
to
the
former
if
youve
never
had
an
americanstyle
barleywine
but
are
familiar
with
the
english
style
then
i
can
see
this
as
being
a
good
transition
complex
and
very
rewarding
very
complex
beer
with
plenty
of
transforming
flavors
during
a
session
the
aroma
is
so
good
its
hard
to
explain
the
cocoa
stays
in
its
place
and
adds
alot
of
complexity
hops
shine
but
dont
overtake
it
very
interesting
and
flavorful
beer
drinkability
off
the
scale
i
honestly
dont
care
about
the
minor
mouthfeel
issue
the
ipa
bent
in
the
aroma
fine
by
me
this
beer
has
what
a
barley
wine
should
be
huge
character
on
both
malt
and
hop
fronts
best
beer
ive
had
in
while
thank
you
nogne
o
o
a
superlative
barleywine
highly
recommended
still
at
9
its
expensive
and
not
everyday
fare
still
id
have
another
one
however
for
many
ibu
beer
its
still
quite
low
and
almost
entirely
a
commercial
lowlevel
process
that
make
reference
to
sell
beer
aside
from
that
the
drink
is
good
100
pours
a
dark
brown
w
a
nice
one
finger
chocolate
head
this
is
one
dark
barleywine
must
be
the
chocolate
malt
slightly
above
average
lacing
on
my
snifter
the
nose
is
really
nice
columbus
chinook
and
centennial
hops
here
and
the
really
the
majority
of
what
i
get
ok
theres
a
hint
of
the
chocolate
malt
on
the
taste
caramel
grapefruit
and
raisin
in
there
too
also
a
hop
bomb
just
went
off
in
my
mouth
but
in
a
good
way
big
malt
backbone
but
the
hops
have
literally
destroyed
my
taste
buds
within
3
tastes
this
is
borderline
4
5
but
not
quite
feel
is
medium
full
with
a
hop
bitter
aftertaste
dry
finish
as
well
probably
the
best
aspect
of
this
brew
overall
this
is
a
nice
barleywine
id
buy
it
again
cheers
absolutely
great
httpwww
thebrewingnetwork
comshows606
will
definitely
buy
this
again
when
i
get
the
chance
lovely
drop
its
deep
and
heavy
but
really
surprisingly
drinkable
o
a
great
barleywine
that
i
would
love
savor
again
overall
this
beer
is
excellent
highly
recommended
pretty
classic
americanstyle
barleywine
o
this
is
a
very
good
barley
wine
i
would
drink
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
a
well
rounded
and
tastey
american
barleywine
with
that
being
said
nothing
stands
out
to
make
it
outstanding
this
is
my
first
nogne
beer
and
i
liked
where
i
started
ill
be
taking
full
advantage
of
my
easy
access
to
their
other
offerings
o
decent
barleywine
and
enough
alcohol
to
make
it
interesting
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
sweet
syrupy
overall
good
carbonation
for
the
style
this
barleywine
is
a
great
sipper
rich
and
sweet
with
some
roasted
chestnut
flavors
this
would
make
a
great
complement
to
many
types
of
afterdinner
treats
d
easy
drinking
but
nothing
spectacular
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
with
some
orange
highlights
the
bead
was
thin
but
coated
the
glass
pretty
well
with
each
sip
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
little
boozy
along
with
some
cocoa
and
hops
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
good
balance
of
the
things
on
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
slick
with
a
decent
carbonation
overall
its
a
pretty
tasty
barley
wine
a
solid
barleywine
average
not
amazing
or
dissapointing
not
as
sweet
as
most
barley
wines
but
it
is
very
rich
theres
an
excellent
hop
bite
to
balance
the
beer
this
has
been
a
superb
balance
to
tangy
barbecue
ribs
in
the
aftertaste
the
alcohol
shows
up
along
with
lingering
sugars
and
hop
bitterness
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
balanced
barley
wine
this
would
be
it
very
unique
and
tasty
beer
unless
this
bottle
is
older
than
i
think
and
their
were
hops
that
fades
id
describe
this
as
more
on
an
english
style
barleywine
but
whatever
its
considered
definitely
a
success
o
a
beer
out
on
a
limb
and
it
manages
to
pull
it
off
well
executed
and
well
balanced
d
an
interesting
barley
wine
that
is
well
worth
a
try
notes
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
that
seems
to
have
aspects
of
an
imperial
porter
brown
ale
and
double
ipa
all
rolled
up
into
an
english
barleywine
it
all
works
well
and
makes
a
very
enjoyable

is
not
noticable
at
all
really
good
stuff
d
be
hard
to
drink
a
few
of
these
but
one
every
now
and
then
is
good
d
very
drinkable
for
the
style
doesnt
feel
very
alcoholic
lots
of
good
flavorsnothing
overpowering
worth
checking
out
a
wellcrafted
barleywine
from
this
highly
impressive
norwegian
brewery
d
i
thought
it
was
a
soild
barleywine
and
the
hops
werent
overwhelming
this
is
the
way
i
likeem
it
was
tasty
but
was
a
sipper
faux
show
d
definitely
drinkable
esp
for
a
barleywine
another
impressive
brew
from
nogne
d
a
nice
overall
barley
one
that
if
i
saw
in
a
store
i
would
grab
this
one
is
a
high
class
sipper
smooth
mouthfeel
nice
low
carbonation
loses
drinkability
points
for
abv
and
alcohol
warmth
there
is
something
about
the
flavor
that
i
just
dont
like
im
not
sure
but
im
only
getting
subtle
hop
flavors
and
mostly
grassy
bitterness
there
is
some
malt
holding
it
togther
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more

this
2
year
old
bottle
shows
about
the
perfect
age
i
think
flavours
are
nicely
developed
and
integrated
alcohol
is
warming
but
not
overbearing
pick
it
up
overall
pretty
good
though
i
admit
i
wasnt
expecting
quite
the
level
of
hops
that
appear
in
nose
and
taste
i
imagine
thats
what
differentiates
an
american
barleywine
from
an
english
barleywine

to

definitely
a
hopforward
barley

in

but
theres
enough

and

to
balance
things
out

a
great

i
would
happily
drink
this
kick
ass
strong
ale
any
day
of
the
week
thanks
to
rr
for
importing
overall
a
well
done
and
very
solid
barleywine
im
not
sure
how
much
time
this
has
had
in
the
cellar
but
it
tastes
like
its
been
put
down
for
a
bit
and
mellowed
out
nicely
pours
an
extremely
dark
rubyamber
color
almost
brown
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
scent
is
pretty
unique
i
pick
up
hops
with
freshly
baked
goodies
i
read
some
of
the
previous
reviews
and
i
totally
see
where
someone
got
oatmealraisin
cookies
from
sweet
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
as
well
very
different
smelling
bw
taste
is
pretty
much
how
i
described
the
scent
first
off
i
get
tons
of
dark
fruits
followed
by
some
fresh
baked
bread
flavors
with
a
bit
of
hops
following
then
it
finishes
with
a
roasty
dark
chocolate
kinda
flavor
not
as
hoppy
as
i
was
expecting
very
tasty
mouthfeel
isnt
nearly
as
chewy
as
was
expected
surprisingly
light
mouthfeel
for
a
bw
the
drinkability
is
fairly
high
considering
the
abv
is
in
the
double
digits
got
one
more
of
these
aging
in
the
cellar
d
quite
high
drinkability
i
am
hit
or
miss
with
barleywines
this
one
was
a
hit
for
me
unbelievably
drinkable
not
sure
how
much
of
that
is
due
to
it
being
cellared
for
over
a
year
but
i
would
be
lying
if
i
said
i
could
taste
even
a
hint
of
alcohol
it
is
nonexistent
a
sipper
beer
however
i
caught
myself
quaffing
it
a
couple
of
times
the
more
i
drink
it
the
slightest
hint
of
warmness
creeps
up
my
throat
the
flavors
meld
in
an
amazing
way
and
wellbalanced
and
a
long
lasting
taste
thats
not
overwhelming
like
indeed

awesome
barleywine
and
my
first
from
this
brewry
ill
have
to
check
out
their
other
styles
very
well
balanced
and
hop
dominated
not
very
like
a
barley
wine
though
tasted
at
a
beer
sampling
at
de
klomp
linköping
sweden
goes
down
rather
well
a
bit
harsh
at
times
but
not
too
bad
a
great
example
of
brewing
as
an
art
and
as
my
first
nogne
o
product
i
can
assure
you
i
will
be
back
for
more
d
this
was
a
worldclass
treat
and
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
goodbye

dark

minimal
ring

decent

scent
is
of
aggressive
carmel
slight
hints
of
smoke
and
earthy

and
piney

taste
is
quite
smooth
for
the
style
solid
carmel
and
roasted
background
with
a
good
american
hop
presence
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
medium
bodied
only
slightly
chewy
good
beer
more
akin
to
a
strong
ale
or
imperial
amber
in
my
eyes
perfect
style
english
barleywine
although
i
dont
think
it
quite
fits
the
style
its
really
just
a
good
strong
ale
hopping
is
great
maltiness
is
great
just
a
great
balanced
strong
ale
nogne
has
some
hit
or
miss
and
you
dont
want
to
miss
for
the
price
tags
but
this
is
a
winner
an
immensely
enjoyable
and
unique
brew
overall
one
of
the
happiest
surprises
ive
come
across
lately
and
one
of
the
better
nonaged
barleywines
in
recent
memory
more
proof
these
scandinavian
brewers
really
know
their
trade
d
a
very
well
made
barleywine
drinkable
not
bad
glad
i
tried
it
pours
a
very
dark
amberbrown
colour
with
offwhite
head
lots
of
lacing
looks
quite
unique
for
a
barleywine
as
id
expect
it
to
be
more
a
dark
orange
colour
sweet
butterscotch
and
citrus
hops
in
the
nose
taste
is
very
complex
im
getting
a
ton
of
caramel
sweetness
there
are
pine
and
citrus
hops
also
i
get
a
lot
of
raisin
fruitiness
too
very
smooth
mouthfeel
definitely
a
sipper
but
it
is
very
delicious
and
a
well
done
barleywine
this
isnt
actually
mindblowing
stuff
but
its
got
all
the
right
characters
and
texture
to
it
beautifully
balanced
heavier
beer
this
is
what
nogne
o
do
best
basically
lets
do
a
barleywine
and
lo
and
behold
theyve
nailed
it
again
d
the
beer
definitely
needs
to
be
sipped
given
the
alcohol
content
ive
never
had
a
barleywine
quite
as
unique
as
this
so
i
would
definitely
try
it
again
dnot
unpleasant
but
sweeter
then
i
would
like
even
more
so
then
many
imperial
stouts
it
is
more
akin
to
a
strong
dark
ale
or
baltic
porter
in
my
opinion
than
a
barleywine
and
would
be
well
suited
for
dessert
this
poured
a
cloudy
dark
mahogany
with
some
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
the
gummy
coke
bottle
candy
with
birch
root
and
sassafras
and
juniper
and
very
earthy
barley
it
tasted
like
birch
root
and
juniper
with
earthy
caramel
and
some
medicinal
flavors
it
was
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersourdirty
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
strange
beer
thats
hard
to
comprehend
as
a
barleywine
it
was
very
earthy
and
herbal
reminding
me
most
of
dfhs
sahtea
but
heavier
it
had
good
body
and
the
alcohol
wasnt
too
noticeable
so
it
wasnt
difficult
to
drink
once
i
acclimated
to
the
taste
recommended
if
only
for
the
novelty
and
experience
not
for
the
quality
or
true
enjoyment
the
pineneedle
hoppiness
overtakes
the
malt
in
100
reminding
me
of
when
barleywines
are
very
young
and
in
need
of
cellaring
would
like
to
try
this
again
in
a
year
or
so
drinkability
a
really
nice
beer
that
shows
off
the
chocolate
malt
in
a
unique
fashion
that
really
works
when
blended
with
the
english
malts
the
wheat
and
the
american
hops
poured
from
a
1
pint
9
ounce
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
i
poured
it
into
a
pilner
glass
i
got
about
4
inches
of
head
that
stayed
for
about
5
minutes
strong
scents
of
dark
dried
fruits
raisins
prunes
some
apricots
and
green
grapes
more
prune
and
malt
taste
some
strong
grape
juice
flavor
really
no
hop
notes
mouthfeel
is
pretty
heavy
and
booze
is
very
heavy
in
the
flavor
drinkable
nature
is
low
the
cost
is
holding
me
back
from
stock
piling
this
beer
thats
the
reason
ive
never
bought
it
i
would
love
to
have
some
of
these
sitting
around
in
my
house
500

it
tastes

grassy
and
citrusy
hops
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
theres
also
a
long
lasting
bitter
hoppy
finish
the
hops
overpower
the
malty
flavors
in
this
beer
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
is
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
decent
its
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
i
think
its
an
ok
enough
brew
but
i
dont
think
its
something
id
buy
very
often
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
but
cant
say
its
anything
that
would
make
me
want
to
try
this
beer
again
either
md
more
malty
than
hoppy
there
is
not
enough
bitterness
to
classify
this
as
american
bwine
territory
just
a
mention
of
bitterness
on
the
tounge
while
the
wheat
and
malts
work
the
mouth
the
body
is
above
medium
with
a
smooth
mellow
carbonation
that
is
not
all
that
crisp
i
had
13oz
of
this
and
while
i
liked
it
i
was
over
this
before
those
13oz
were
finished
i
guess
this
is
really
a
mix
of
a
dipabwine
an
odd
mix
that
gets
the
job
done
i
guess
d
big
stuff
with
a
lot
going
on
enjoyed
my
13
oz
but
that
was
enough
good
stuff
but
not
the
best
of
the
style
drinkability
fine
still
itd
be
nice
to
taste
it
young
this
was
an
older
bottle
so
the
hops
probably
faded
a
bit
but
it
was
still
enjoyable
mouthfeel
was
wonderful
this
was
smooth
and
slick
at
times
drinkability
is
good
with
the
alcohol
not
being
a
burning
sensation
but
more
of
a
slow
warm
very
nice
and
complex
barleywine
here
became
better
and
better
as
it
warmed
ive
read
that
this
was
intended
to
be
an
american
dipa
by
the
brewer
and
that
the
u
s
version
of
this
bottle
was
labeled
incorrectly
as
a
barleywine
i
have
no
idea
if
that
is
even
remotely
valid
but
it
was
in
my
head
as
i
drank
this
one
i
would
have
pegged
this
as
a
strong
dark
ale
the
1st
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
trois
pistoles
whatever
it
is
or
isnt
i
like
it
a
lot
great
beer

solid
example

this
one
has
a
couple
years
on
it
so
its
evened
out
a
little
bit
it
must
have
been
quite
hoppy
in
its
prime
might
pick
up
another
bottle
to
see
how
it
mellows
in
a
couple
more
years
d
overall
a
wonderful
beer
to
drink
i
would
think
of
this
as
an
american
black
ipa
instead
of
a
barley
wine
get
this
beer
drinkability
i
understand
why
these
brews
are
so
much
but
im
always
a
bit
hesitant
to
pay
the
around
10
price
for
one
bottle
that
said
i
sipped
this
for
over
three
hours
and
i
enjoyed
everything
about
it
im
just
not
sure
its
all
i
expected
and
more
which
was
what
i
was
hoping
for
i
wonder
how
great
this
would
be
in
bourbon
barrels
even
though
many
breweries
seem
to
be
doing
that
these
days
this
is
such
a
solid
beer
overall
and
everything
they
do
is
quality
that
its
hard
to
find
something
to
pick
on
at
all
and
though
im
not
i
just
wonder
if
for
the
price
you
couldnt
get
a
few
domestics
just
as
good
since
more
and
more
domestic
craft
and
microbreweries
seem
to
be
stepping
it
up
with
the
style
this
is
an
excellent
american
barleywine
tons
of
hops
without
being
overly
bitter
and
some
sweetness
for
balance
something
i
highly
recommend
dc
this
beer
at
10
abv
definitely
packs
a
punch
of
all
the
barleywines
ive
had
though
this
definitely
ranks
up
there
as
one
of
the
finer
a
truly
incredible
interpretation
of
new
world
meets
old
world
and
is
something
that
i
would
continue
to
rely
on
at
the
ski
lodge
in
scandinavia
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
and
well
carbonated
though
not
as
much
so
as
in
the
bottle
it
foams
thickly
on
the
palate
a
characteristic
ive
never
experienced
to
this
extreme
before
instead
of
popping
all
over
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
though
it
is
very
fullbodied
and
filling
when
it
hits
the
stomach
for
me
this
beer
pretty
much
excels
in
all
areas
except
actual
taste
damn
i
was
expecting
an
easy
overall
score
of
4
0
i
have
no
reason
at
all
to
believe
this
is
a
bad
bottle
either
it
just
comes
off
to
me
as
bitter
hop
for
the
sake
of
bitter
hop
i
can
find
more
interesting
hopmalt
interplay
in
west
coast
dipas
even
it
doesnt
seem
well
thoughtout
which
i
find
surprising
given
that
ive
absolutely
loved
every
nogne
o
beer
ive
tried
feel
and
drinkability
finish
is
clean
and
dry
leaves
you
wanting
more
very
dry
almost
to
the
point
of
parching
the
palate
making
the
tongue
feel
swollen
carbonation
is
low
as
it
should
be
and
for
a
10
beer
and
a
barley
wine
its
not
nearly
as
warming
as
i
thought
itd
be
for
a
barley
wine
this
is
an
easy
drinker
though
im
not
sure
that
is
what
i
really
want
when
it
comes
to
the
style
i
want
something
that
demands
sipping
i
mean
this
doesnt
demand
sipping
it
doesnt
encourage
quaffing
either
but
i
think
it
goes
down
too
easily
for
a
barleywine
body
is
slick
and
full
and
leaves
some
alcohol
on
the
palate
after
being
swallowed
good
beer
but
not
great
give
it
a
shot
but
im
still
a
much
bigger
fan
of
old
guardian
very
good
but
should
not
be
almost
ten
dollars
for
a
single
then
again
its
an
import
so
ill
deal
i
love
everything
else
ive
had
from
nogneo
and
i
like
this
one
too
sweet
and
sticky
on
the
lips
a
good
beer
but
i
was
expecting
more
could
be
phenomenal
if
it
had
a
larger
malt
backbone
to
support
all
of
the
the
hops
an
amazingly
delicious
beer
great
mouthfeel
not
oily
a
little
chewy
well
balanced
and
everything
works
together
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
i
can
easily
drink
this
without
being
to
overwhelmed
is
this
a
dipa
or
a
barleywine
i
think
it
falls
somewhere
in
between
the
two
an
immensely
enjoyable
and
unique
brew
d
should
be
consumed
with
caution
but
ow
a
very
nice
one
drinkability
is
pretty
nice
for
such
a
high
abv
drink
i
really
admire
this
barley
wine
top
notch
d
an
interesting
slight
twist
on
the
style
with
the
chocolate
malt
in
here
easy
enough
to
finish
this
bottle
the
10
price
tag
makes
me
uncertain
how
quickly
i
would
want
to
drink
another
drinkability
all
in
all
a
nice
barleywine
with
sufficient
kick
from
both
hops
and
alcohol
not
a
favorite
however
and
not
one
i
will
be
tracking
down
again
its
indeed
a
tasty
brew
the
high
abv
will
keep
you
out
of
it
though
except
in
small
doses
drinkability
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
could
have
a
bit
more
taste
to
my
liking
i
will
definitely
grab
another
bottle
or
two
of
this
gem
to
me
this
beer
is
much
closer
to
an
imperial
stout
than
a
barleywine
in
pretty
much
every
aspect
d
if
i
had
a
6
pack
i
would
drink
it
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
one
pours
a
very
dark
brownred
with
just
a
slight
tinge
around
the
edges
the
head
was
tight
and
it
laced
like
a
nitrocan
awesome
the
nose
is
predominantly
chocolate
malt
backed
by
some
bitter
coffee
notes
and
a
little
dark
fruitiness
a
kiss
of
piney
hp
action
is
also
present
on
the
palate
it
has
very
low
carbonation
leaving
the
huge
alcoholic
bitterness
to
kick
you
in
the
mouth
its
pretty
smooth
once
you
get
used
to
it
the
finish
is
a
little
short
considering
how
big
the
flavour
is
this
is
a
fine
beer
however
it
is
a
bit
of
a
struggle
to
get
through
one
glass
let
alone
the
rest
of
this
500ml
bottle
this
was
really
odd
and
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
as
it
is
considered
a
barleywine
an
american
at
that
the
color
is
dark
brown
like
a
doppelbock
or
such
very
odd
aroma
is
somehwat
bitter
but
mostly
is
dominated
by
deep
dark
malt
chocolate
mostly
this
carries
into
the
flavor
very
unbalanced
with
strong
malt
presence
and
some
dry
bitterness
the
chocolate
malt
doesnt
mix
well
with
what
other
flavors
are
present
mouth
is
standard
and
probably
the
best
part
of
the
drink
moderate
body
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
all
around
i
just
cant
get
over
the
flavor
i
dont
think
this
bottle
is
spoiled
or
such
but
its
just
way
too
much
malt
for
a
barleywine
final
thoughts
a
really
good
roasted
porter
chocolate
ris
and
dark
fruit
barleywine
mixed
together
it
starts
with
a
nice
alcohol
kick
but
after
a
few
sips
it
hides
the
10
very
well
it
also
starts
sweet
but
dies
pretty
quickly
and
leaves
a
nice
bittering
on
the
finish
with
the
creamy
chocolate
roasted
goodness
i
dont
remember
how
much
it
costs
but
i
would
be
very
inclined
to
get
it
again
i
remember
that
the
brewers
came
to
julios
a
while
back
to
sample
a
bunch
of
their
wares
and
this
was
the
one
i
brought
home
and
now
i
remember
why
they
had
quite
a
few
good
beers
if
my
fuzzy
memory
hits
me
correctly
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
seemed
to
have
a
very
short
finish
which
was
interesting
very
bold
flavors
up
front
that
leave
you
taste
buds
just
as
quickly
as
they
arrived
courtesy
some
dude
on
rb
thanks
for
opening
this
beer
that
strongwasstrong
on
my
wants
list
pours
deep
brown
with
lasting
tan
head
the
aroma
is
hoppy
and
earthy
underneath
that
is
an
upwelling
of
sweet
caramel
candy
the
taste
begins
with
a
pulse
of
pine
grass
and
earthy
hop
bitterness
behind
the
hops
is
a
caramely
sweet
river
of
goodness
that
is
nearly
hidden
by
the
hops
wow
nice
thick
mouth
feel
too
taste
similar
to
a
lot
of
am
strong
ales
ive
had
the
abv
is
only
moderately
apparent
and
not
at
all
distracting
the
flavours
here
are
so
good
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
making
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
any
brewer
should
be
proud
to
produce
my
first
nogne
o
beer
and
i
am
very
impressed
drinkability
nice
mix
between
and
english
and
american
barleywine
thumbs
up
all
the
way
its
drinkable
its
a
sipper
im
ok
with
this
one
overall
interesting
stuff
and
there
are
quite
a
few
layers
on
this
one
really
enjoyable
and
worth
a
look
there
is
also
an
overwhelming
cinnamon
flavor
and
character
so
not
really
liking
cinnamon
i
suspect
that
too
may
influence
me
interesting
to
try
not
to
drink
d
a
very
tasty
beer
with
an
interesting
combination
of
sweet
malty
flavors
of
an
english
barleywine
and
generous
amounts
of
american
hops
also
the
prominent
chocolate
flavors
add
a
little
extra
to
the
brew
thank
you
norway
for
this
treat
d
this
is
not
a
summer
beer
this
would
be
perfect
in
january
and
now
that
i
know
that
i
know
when
bottle
2
will
be
consumed
i
could
drink
more
of
this
than
just
the
one
bottle
because
it
is
tasty
and
has
just
in
general
a
nice
flavor
to
it
nothing
really
spectacular
but
id
buy
it
again
a
little
pricey
but
could
be
worse
really
a
dipa
it
has
more
bw
charecter
than
a
dipa
im
reviewing
this
as
a
bw
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
deep
malt
presence
that
is
mostly
caramel
and
dark
fruits
flavor
brings
out
the
hops
there
are
some
hops
in
the
back
that
leaves
a
slight
bitterness
but
definitly
not
of
the
american
hop
bomb
caliber
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
minimal
carbonation
its
really
just
a
big
beer
not
quite
a
bw
but
not
quite
a
dipa
but
enjoyable
j
the
taste
was
similar
to
the
aroma
dark
chocolate
upfront
with
some
cocoa
earthy
and
herbal
hop
bitterness
with
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
surprised
at
how
hoppy
this
beer
still
is
after
almost
2
years
heavily
roasted
malt
flavors
almost
burnt
burnt
toast
and
bitter
coffee
in
the
finish
moderate
carbonation
with
a
semidry
and
lingering
bitter
finish
tastes
almost
like
a
really
hoppy
ris
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
i
guess
its
hiding
behind
those
ibus
my
first
nogne
brew
and
highly
anticipated
very
deep
brown
bordering
on
black
in
color
a
flurry
of
carbonation
results
in
a
bubbly
mediumsized
tan
head
that
has
great
retention
when
it
finally
fades
a
constellation
of
little
dots
surround
the
middle
of
the
snifter
and
a
few
clumps
of
bubbles
are
left
on
top
of
the
brew
smells
pleasant
with
deep
chocolates
and
ripe
red
cherries
easing
into
some
piny
hops
subtle
sweet
malts
and
dark
dried
fruits
flow
across
the
palate
and
are
followed
by
a
big
hit
of
more
piney
hops
distant
dark
chocolates
and
fairly
sharp
and
lingering
alcohol
heat
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
and
it
initially
goes
down
smooth
and
creamy
but
a
certain
crispness
forms
around
the
edges
after
a
few
drinks
making
things
interesting
i
can
see
where
aging
one
of
these
would
make
a
big
difference
in
rounding
off
some
of
the
sharp
edges
but
its
still
good
to
go
as
is
and
very
satisfying
if
ever
there
was
a
late
cold
night
sipper
this
was
it
warms
you
up
lie
a
log
fire
very
damn
nice
indeed
the
second
round
of
tui
is
coming
to
a
close
ill
have
another
treat
tomorrow
night
when
this
resumes
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
awesome
wow
what
a
great
hop
nose
it
has
a
tremendous
citrus
character
thats
complimented
with
a
light
caramel
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
great
as
well
the
aroma
really
translated
to
the
taste
its
a
hop
bomb
for
sure
with
mostly
pale
malts
and
a
hint
of
caramelchocolate
for
complexity
there
is
a
bit
of
yeast
fruitiness
that
mixes
well
with
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
terrific
barleywine
its
highly
drinkable
and
has
a
lovely
hop
character
recommended
d
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
nothing
like
a
barley
wine
with
a
little
time
on
it
the
chocolate
really
threw
me
off
and
impressed
me
really
solid
beer
drinkability
this
abv
size
of
bottle
and
mouthfeel
sipper
d
full
of
flavour
that
i
love
will
be
buying
more
asap
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
rough
grainy
texture
that
the
carbonation
smooths
over
nicely
despite
how
boozy
it
tastes
no
overt
burn
from
the
alcohol
at
all
which
would
make
it
pretty
drinkable
but
i
just
dont
dig
the
flavours
that
much
im
wondering
if
a
bit
of
age
would
do
it
some
good
i
suspect
so
and
i
have
some
more
so
i
guess
ill
find
out
at
this
point
though
not
a
patch
on
the
likes
of
mikkeller
big
worse
a
little
underrated
on
this
site
imo
drinks
really
easy
for
the
style
abv
this
one
really
impressed
me
the
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
old
guardian
but
a
bit
sweeter
fruitier
and
with
a
bit
more
residual
sweetness
on
the
palate
a
very
enjoyable
session
outstanding
overall
a
very
nice
barley
wine
who
knew
the
best
americanstyle
barley
wine
was
made
in
norway
top
notch
brew
blipped
a
little
more
for
little
you
by
the
hives
its
a
slow
sipper
good
for
relaxing
with
after
a
long
day
which
is
what
im
doing
right
now
nogne
is
one
my
favorite
european
never
mind
scandanavian
breweries
some
of
their
offerings
imperial
stout
and
porter
are
extraordinary
i
think
we
can
add
100
barley
winestyle
ale
to
the
list
this
is
an
asskicking
beer
its
as
simple
as
that
the
hops
come
out
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
dry
grassy
feel
at
the
back
on
my
tongue
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
color
with
hints
of
dark
red
and
amber
coming
through
it
has
a
huge
nice
fullfy
head
that
leaves
awesome
lace
the
smell
is
very
rich
and
mainly
of
roasted
malt
but
it
also
has
some
spice
to
it
possibly
some
cinnamon
also
the
aroma
has
a
bit
of
herbalness
to
it
which
i
find
somewhat
weird
the
taste
is
similar
big
and
malty
but
still
has
that
strange
herbal
character
it
almost
taste
like
mint
leaves
or
maybe
some
juniper
it
is
a
little
off
putting
to
me
but
i
suppose
it
lightens
it
up
too
good
beer
but
far
from
my
favorite
nogne
o
d
a
smooth
sipper
what
a
beautiful
take
on
the
style
i
would
get
this
again
in
a
second
light
carbonation
a
bit
soft
and
a
full
body
that
leans
just
a
smidge
towards
syrupy
all
in
all

impressive

is

it
seemed
like
lots

there
other
scents
included
wheat
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
flavor
was
rather
hoppy
heard
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
dipa
when
i
was
stone
a
few
weeks
ago
there
was
some
issues
with
the
labeling
before
it
was
imported
reminded
me
a
lot
of
a
dark
india
pale
ale
in
fact
much
more
than
a
barleywine
bitterness
overpowered
a
lot
of
the
other
flavors
but
i
was
not
complaining
tasted
more
of
the
malt
by
the
end
when
it
warmed
pine
and
grapefruit
were
around
in
the
finish
and
mixed
uniquely
with
the
sweet
and
roasty
accents
mouthfeel
is
dry
bitter
and
slightly
roasted
medium
bodied
good
level
of
carbonation
taste
lingered
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
considering
it
is
ten
percent
alcohol
is
hidden
well
dry
enough
to
make
the
sweet
qualities
balance
out
and
then
some
good
drinkability
glad
the
brewers
did
not
keep
this
all
for
themselves
and
released
a
good
amount
of
it
commercially
wish
i
had
more
of
this
to
cellar
a
great
beer
from
a
great
norway
brewery
one
of
the
better
beers
from
overseas
that
i
have
had
in
a
while
recommended
pours
a
very
dark
brown
colored
body
with
a
huge
foamy
creamy
tan
colored
head
extremely
lasting
with
okay
lacing
has
a
dark
fruity
aroma
hoppy
sickly
sweet
smelling
some
strong
raisin
nose
smokey
taste
light
body
dark
coffee
taste
tasty
i
wouldnt
say
this
beer
looks
bad
but
for
the
style
its
just
not
right
looking
at
this
i
would
never
ever
guess
this
is
a
barleywine
looks
just
like
a
stout
its
black
with
a
big
tan
head
with
great
lacing
and
retention
just
no
evidence
of
barleywine
in
the
appearance
the
smell
is
really
incredible
theres
a
lot
of
sweetness
underneath
i
can
imagine
there
being
a
lot
more
hoppiness
in
the
smell
when
this
was
fresh
but
there
is
still
a
clear
crisp
hop
smell
kind
of
floral
and
spicy
with
a
bit
of
citrus
in
the
smell
there
is
still
a
slight
smell
of
dark
malts
which
is
a
bit
uncharacteristic
but
i
can
forgive
it
for
the
rest
of
the
smell
i
feel
a
bit
selfcontradictory
now
the
taste
is
great
at
this
age
very
smooth
and
sweet
almost
creamy
there
a
good
deep
dark
fruity
character
to
it
with
just
a
tiny
bit
of
caramel
and
i
even
get
a
good
rush
of
bitterness
the
creaminess
is
really
the
shining
moment
making
the
mouthfeel
perfect
there
is
almost
no
alcohol
presence
or
hotness
i
found
myself
constantly
reaching
to
have
more
of
this
and
it
was
gone
quickly
i
feel
bad
as
i
post
this
for
the
first
score
but
i
think
its
appropriate
considering
the
style
but
barleywine
might
be
the
best
category
and
i
wouldnt
suggest
dialing
it
down
as
it
might
miss
out
on
some
of
the
rest
of
the
high
points
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
drink
this
this
is
incredible
and
a
great
gift
many
thanks
pretty
average
maybe
the
roughness
is
in
the
youth
of
the
beer
perhaps
itll
smooth
out
improve
with
age
more
than
likely
ill
never
find
out
very
very
drinkable
easily
the
best
beer
i
had
on
new
years
eve
d
too
big
this
barleywine
is
too
big
one
bottle
is
more
than
enough
for
one
sitting
this
beer
has
a
unique
beguiling
flavor
the
flavors
are
so
well
blended
that
its
difficult
for
me
to
pull
them
apart
good
head
good
color
it
meets
barleywine
standards
the
edge
is
in
the
blended
flavor
i
hope
to
find
more
of
it
here
in
chicago

worth
cellaring
d
the
flavor
was
very
refined
and
soft
making
for
an
incredible
drinkability
factor
quite
possibly
the
smoothest
and
most
refined
barleywine
style
ive
ever
had
an
incredible
recommend
taste
is
pretty
similar
to
the
smell
with
a
nice
bitterness
and
lots
of
citrus
fruits
and
notes
of
chocolate
and
oats
its
a
quite
sweet
beer
actually
and
the
high
abv
makes
it
great
to
sip
on
for
an
hour
or
two
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
one
its
very
balanced
with
lots
of
sweet
dark
malt
and
a
solid
hoppy
bitterness
heja
norge
drinkability
is
moderate
to
high
its
an
intriguing
barleywine
which
is
what
i
love
about
it
though
the
flavor
is
not
the
best
ive
come
across
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
by
my
estimation
and
it
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
a
pleasant
experience
and
a
nice
twist
consider
me
a
fan
drinkability
glad
i
tried
this
one
thereve
been
bottles
on
the
shelf
at
greens
for
quite
some
time
though
there
seems
to
be
only
one
left
at
the
time
of
this
review
i
might
pick
it
up
myself
but
if
someone
else
gets
to
it
first
i
hope
they
enjoy
it
this
is
a
tasty
beer
bold
big
wellhopped
wellhopped
and
wellrespected
by
yours
truly
recommended
if
you
see
it
this
is
a
unique
different
darker
barleywine
it
has
a
nice
interaction
of
malts
that
show
themselves
well
while
allowing
hops
to
be
showcased
its
a
shame
to
see
this
listed
as
retired
as
it
is
a
nice
treat
that
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
having
as
an
occasional
something
different
treat
especially
on
a
coolcold
evening
a
surprising
look
as
i
poured
this
one
into
a
snifter
a
deep
dark
brown
color
looked
thick
add
to
that
a
solid
creamy
head
the
smell
was
not
very
strong
some
chocolate
hints
the
first
sip
verified
the
thickness
of
this
beer
which
was
in
contrast
to
my
previous
barley
wine
experiences
it
still
has
a
barely
wine
taste
just
a
chocolatemalty
strength
added
to
it
i
like
it
dont
get
me
wrong
the
thickness
helped
balance
the
strong
carbonization
and
made
it
go
down
easy
an
excellent
beer
to
have
one
evening
by
itself
im
gonna
sit
on
the
rest
of
these
ales
to
see
what
happens
all
in
all
a
very
interresting
experience
this
is
a
real
eye
opener
and
worth
tracking
down
if
you
can
find
a
bottle
i
wonder
how
it
will
age
pours
a
cocacolalish
brown
with
some
dark
garnet
highlights
pretty
light
beige
head
that
slowly
recedes
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
very
complex
lots
of
dark
malty
nuts
with
some
soft
plum
juice
and
maybe
some
caramel
the
taste
is
very
heavy
on
the
dark
fruis
roasted
prnes
baked
cherries
a
splash
of
roasted
malts
gives
a
grainy
bread
taste
and
texture
very
warm
nd
fruity
palat
and
actuly
becomes
a
little
winey
as
it
warms
great
sipping
beer
and
a
great
dark
barely
wine
form
the
norse
i
had
this
sitting
my
cellar
for
about
six
months
and
the
last
day
of
july
seemed
like
a
good
occasion
to
open
it
this
beer
had
a
deep
dark
brown
body
with
a
nice
1
tall
light
tan
head
the
smell
seemed
a
little
muted
a
little
chocolate
some
alcohol
as
it
warmed
up
a
little
more
biscuit
smell
came
out
but
that
was
it
the
taste
started
a
little
sweet
and
then
a
nice
bitter
woody
hop
bite
the
malt
was
kind
of
like
a
rye
beer
that
may
have
been
from
the
hops
but
i
was
tasting
rye
it
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
for
a
barleywine
but
still
nice
and
thick
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
for
a
10
abv
beer
the
lightness
and
good
carbonation
made
it
very
drinkable
i
got
two
of
these
puppies
the
second
city
beer
put
out
a
scandinavian
section
i
opened
one
up
not
know
what
to
expect
and
i
was
please
the
second
one
i
ages
for
probably
67
months
it
doesnt
need
intense
aging
norwegians
despite
the
fact
that
their
still
trying
to
find
their
place
know
how
to
make
a
good
brew
the
same
characteristics
from
the
fresher
version
hold
true
to
the
aged
version
chocolate
aroma
light
sugary
taste
mellow
hop
flavor
this
beer
is
a
good
chillum
barley
wine
its
got
all
the
characteristics
of
a
west
coast
bw
but
its
not
a
punch
in
the
face
like
big
foot
this
beer
wants
you
to
relax
but
enjoy
the
flavor
full
on
i
hope
this
beer
shows
up
more
often
its
a
keeper
poured
a
deep
brown
with
large

and
i
mean
huge
biggest
i
have
seen
foir
a

so
big
that
i
had
to
let
it
settle
for
5
minutes
or
so
nose
was
nice
chocolate
malts
english
malts
and
well
hopped
taste
was
rather
light
bodied
for
a
bwine
while
it
was
tasty
it
did
lack
the
malt
and
hops
profiles
of
the
typical
american
bwine
the
abv
was
more
than
the
taste
to
me
mouthfeel
was
good
some
age
would
do
this
well
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
good
beer
just
dont
expect
a
traditional
barleywine
d
awesome
sipper
just
like
the
bottle
described
maybe
miss
filed
but
who
cares
shouldnt
let
the
definitions
dominate
your
perceptions
and
how
you
judge
it
biggest

ever
ever

really
and
the
other
flavors
arent

developed
might
mellow
with

overall
wonderful
drinking
beer
that
is
a

i
really
liked
this
one
almost
like
bigfoot
drinkabilityoverall
probably
the
cleanest
smoothest
beer
with
this
level
of
assertiveness
ive
experienced
the
complexity
and
brashness
of
an
american
barleywine
with
the
restraint
and
elegance
that
comes
with
a
long
european
brewing
tradition
a
good
way
to
end
a
long
night
of
good
beer
very
very
dark
nigh
stoutish
quite
attractive
hydrocephalic
smell
is
kinda
faint
but
theres
excuse
me
i
detect
fig
newtons
and
booze
travis
says
its
got
a
very
clean
flavor
and
hes
right
its
a
pretty
dry
barleywine
flavor
sweet
for
a
second
but
with
a
very
bitter
lingering
hop
finish
that
i
found
unpleasant
the
finish
detracts
from
the
drinkability
for
me
but
i
might
just
be
worn
out
from
the
mikkeller
jackie
brown
i
had
earlier
tonight
my
tongue
may
be
crying
out
for
mercy
mouthfeel
is
full
and
satisfying
d
i
expected
a
lot
from
this
beer
based
on
previous
efforts
from
nogne
o
and
it
really
delivered
quite
an
interesting
example
of
a
barleywine
at
times
it
seems
like
a
classic
example
but
at
other
moments
it
reminds
me
of
an
imperial
stout
or
even
a
quadruple
this
is
the
3rd
nogne
beer
i
have
had
and
in
my
book
these
guys
are
good
enough
to
be
officially
exempt
from
style
guidelines
in
any
case
this
is
a
complex
and
superbly
balanced
beer
that
is
extremely
easy
to
sip
poured
into
a
heavy
glass
chalice
formed
a
12
brown
head
over
the
almost
opaque
dark
brown
brew
head
recedes
graduallly
with
sporadic
but
ample
lacing
aroma
is
dark
grains
fresh
green
hops
and
alcohol
taste
starts
with
a
glimpse
of
maltiness
which
becomes
all
about
the
hops
from
then
on
with
some
alcohol
presence
noted
at
the
close
and
beyond
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
prickly
due
to
the
hops
abundance
with
not
quite
enough
sweetness
to
smooth
it
out
and
drinkability
shares
the
same
issue
not
a
bad
barleywine
its
not
as
extreme
as
most
of
the
other
american
versions
but
still
hoppy
enough
for
anyone
who
likes
that
it
has
a
decent
amount
of
complexity
i
dont
know
how
well
this
one
would
perform
after
aged
for
a
year
or
so
i
think
this
one
is
best
enjoyed
fresh
recommended
eidt
taken
down
several
notches
in
review
for
one
i
tried
some
warm
wow
was
that
ever
nasty
for
another
i
had
another
beer
then
came
back
to
this
one
its
so
not
a
barleywine
that
im
pissed
at
the
brewer
for
calling
it
one
dang
it
we
want
malts
and
hops
but
those
malts
were
not
looking
for
chocolate
darn
it
all
if
we
wanted
chocolate
or
a
beer
this
dark
wed
drink
an
ris
quite
impressive
for
an
inmport
of
an
american
barleywine
not
intense
but
could
still
benefit
from
a
bit
of
aging
worth
picking
up
a
few
bottles
bottom
covered
in
yeasty
slough
the
velvety
smoothness
easily
masks
the
high
octane
the
body
is
smooth
and
a
touch
creamy
rather
round
around
the
edges
for
a
big
barleywine
quite
nice
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
big
beer
although
theres
no
mistaking
its
strength
good
stuff
from
an
excellent
emerging
brewery
finish
is
long
with
a
pleasant
caramel
taste
pours
a
five
finger
light
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
totally
black
color
medium
carbonation
and
very
heavy
bodied
sweet
malty
nose
label
lists
this
as
barleywine
but
its
more
like
an
ipa
flavor
is
strong
hops
with
caramel
smooth
yet
bitter
almost
cough
syrup
with
lingering
bitterness
high
abv
completely
hidden
good
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
7
95
for
a
500ml
bottle
from
johns
marketplace
portland
or
other
comments
definitely
a
winter
beer
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
barleywine
i
brewed
about
four
years
ago
a
bit
too
full
bodied
the
sediment
is
really
loose
though
pour
carefully
poured
from
bottle
into
a
rastal
snifter
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
huge
thick
tan
foamy
head
smell
was
toffee
sweet
bread
with
slight
dark
fruit
aromas
that
are
followed
by
a
even
fainter
alcohol
present
taste
is
roasted
malt
dry
flavor
mixed
with
bitter
citrus
rind
and
slight
bitter
pine
flavor
finished
with
a
raisin
spice
flavor
the
dryness
on
the
finish
and
the
well
concealed
alcohol
make
this
a
very
drinkable
barleywine
pours
a
very
dark
brown
that
only
shows
light
when
it
is
the
thinnest
part
of
a
glass
big
light
tan
head
nose
is
slight
hops
with
a
big
hit
of
alcohol
flavor
is
strong
seems
fairly
dominated
by
alcohol
there
is
a
definite
hop
presence
there
but
i
feel
like
it
would
help
this
beer
a
lot
to
just
lay
down
for
a
few
years
and
mature
feel
is
well
bodied
on
the
liquid
and
the
carbonation
is
good
as
well
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
but
like
i
said
it
could
probably
use
several
more
years
on
its
side
pours
deep
amber
almost
black
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
hoppy
and
somewhat
plummish
in
the
taste
plum
caramel
and
just
a
nice
hop
presence
backing
it
up
a
smooth
malty
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
small
hop
and
small
plum
in
the
aftertaste
somewhere
between
an
ipa
and
a
barleywine
color
threw
me
off
but
otherwise
really
great
nearly
gone
in
no
time
flat
way
too
drinkable
for
10
much
like
other
great
barleywines
this
stuff
hits
ya
late
and
the
next
thing
you
know
you
cant
remember
where
you
put
your
glass
as
you
try
to
find
your
slippers
so
you
can
go

good
barleywine
not
up
to
par
with
their
ris
and
porter
but
still
a
solid
brew
a
bit
expensive
but
we
only
live
once
nice
big
ale
but
it
feels
to
to
owe
more
lineage
with
baltic
porters
than
american
barleywine
get
some
d
it
is
pretty
good
the
first
few
sips
are
kind
of
questionable
but
after
a
few
it
does
come
around
on
you
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
but
it
is
a
really
good
barleywine
and
might
try
to
get
a
couple
more
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
barleywine
as
this
bottle
went
down
fairly
quickly
try
this
one
but
it
is
expensive
mouthfeel
is
difficult
to
handle
at
first
and
seemed
harshly
carbonated
but
as
i
make
my
way
through
the
glass
and
eventually
the
500ml
bottle
i
find
it
to
be
creamy
and
on
par
drinkability
is
low
even
given
the
style
due
to
the
harsh
present
of
alcohol
and
astringent
hop
taste
this
came
off
as
surprising
given
what
i
thought
was
well
developed
in
the
nose
i
have
looked
forward
to
getting
this
beer
for
sometime
and
now
i
know
whypoured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
tight
formed
almond
colored
head
that
left
broken
lace
as
it
settled
as
i
worked
my
way
down
the
glass
whoo
intense
aromas
big
leather
and
hop
resin
along
with
quite
an
alcohol
kick
nearly
boozy
but
oh
so
inviting
a
pruneraisin
element
is
there
as
well
flavors
are
complex
to
the
hilt
as
well
as
being
potentdeep
molasses
and
licorice
combined
with
deep
hoppy
resiny
goodness
as
well
as
a
unrestrained
alcohol
shot
really
makes
this
a
monsterthe
flavors
are
awesome
all
that
in
your
face
deep
malt
and
intense
hop
really
makes
it
a
sipper
english
barley
wine
are
you
kidding
methis
is
american
style
no
doubt
with
the
deep
intense
hop
profile
makes
it
american
style
easilyjust
a
great
brew
great
stuff
once
again
the
norwegians
are
showing
they
can
do
it
as
well
as
anyone
go
grimstad
drinkability
very
nice
indeed
not
too
big
nut
also
not
too
bland
paired
well
with
thanksgiving
dinner
all
the
way
through
from
hors
doeuvres
to
dessert
the
craftsmen
at
nøgne
ø
have
had
me
captivated
with
their
unique
blend
of
european
style
and
american
boldness
i
was
definitely
not
going
to
let
100
barley
winestyle
ale
pass
me
by
slender
500
ml
bottle
with
a
starkly
attractive
label
style
the
pour
looked
quite
dark
for
a
barleywine
while
the
head
was
three
fingers
tall
and
foamy
the
smell
was
quite
sweet
and
had
me
recall
raisins
toffee
and
cocoa
the
taste
was
not
typical
of
the
style
as
the
malts
felt
very
roasty
and
astringent
the
bitterness
was
quite
brazing
as
a
result
of
the
bone
dry
nature
of
the
beer
the
chocolate
roasted
nuts
and
smoke
in
the
taste
screamed
imperial
porter
to
me
a
big
blast
of
oak
notes
in
the
finish
had
me
wondering
whether
this
was
barrel
aged
before
bottling
quite
thin
and
fleeting
in
the
mouth
this
unusual
ale
was
well
crafted
and
sneaky
in
the
alcohol
presentation
but
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
call
this
a
barleywine
nice
but
oddly
dark
i
enjoyed
the
use
of
hops
in
this
one
s
for
the
style
most
excellent
final
notes
not
quite
one
style
or
another
with
elements
that
are
nice
but
not
quite
melding
nicely
in
the
playground
may
round
out
with
more
age
but
for
this
review
its
as
experienced
drinkability
an
interesting
unique
hrbid
beer
for
sure
with
plenty
to
offer
and
begs
if
not
requires
to
be
sipped
drinkability
is
good
mostly
balanced
with
a
just
a
slight
lean
towards
alcohol
very
nice
though
and
a
solid
barelywine
ive
been
pretty
impressed
by
just
about
everything
ive
had
from
nogne
good
brewery
purchased
at
greens
on
ponce
in
atlanta
certainly
not
retired
and
billed
as
a
barley
wine
on
the
bottle
on
the
other
hand
doesnt
particularly
look
like
a
barley
wine
or
a
dipa
pours
black
with
a
white
head
that
sticks
around
a
bit
and
leaves
some
lacing
the
smell
is
roasty
chocolatey
and
winey
the
taste
is
bitter
with
citrus
up
front
then
comes
chocolate
a
big
hit
of
pine
throughout
or
maybe
that
is
juniper
the
mouthfeel
is
big
rich
and
creamy
quite
drinkablconsidering
the
abv
but
definitely
a
sipper
solid
creamy
mouthfeel
the
fact
that
i
am
not
sure
and
neither
is
the
beer
exactly
what
it
is
that
i
am
drinking
and
this
burning
alcohol
both
knock
the
drinkability
down
i
had
hoped
for
more
i
think
i
might
buy
another
bottle
and
lay
it
down
for
a
while
to
see
how
it
changes
as
it
is
harsh
right
now
overall
too
much
harsh
alcohol
and
bitterness
for
me
i
dont
get
any
grapefruit
or
pine
from
the
hops
which
is
disappointing
it
reminds
me
some
of
flying
dogs
barley
wine
which
i
really
didnt
care
for
either
bottled
150
what
better
name
of
a
beer
to
rate
as
beer
no
100
than
this
dark
copper
with
dense
beigelight
tan
head
its
hazy
but
thats
not
easy
to
see
because
of
the
rather
dark
color
nice
carbonation
too
and
the
head
stays
quite
nice
aroma
is
mostly
fruity
bitterness
with
pine
flavor
is
hops
fruity
alcohol
and
malt
caramelsweet
malty
beginning
that
quickly
turns
into
bitterness
and
warming
alcohol
and
more
bitterness
towards
the
finish
had
this
some
times
earlier
at
uptown
pub
in
kristiansand
but
they
serve
it
directly
from
the
fridge
it
needs
1215º
c
to
show
all
of
itselves
051011
very
drinkable
for
such
a
big
rich
bold
brew
certainly
not
very
approachable
or
sessionable
but
is
a
deep
and
complex
sipper
that
just
may
appeal
to
afficionados
of
red
wines
and
port
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
incredibly
rich
and
complex
brew
way
too
much
going
on
maltwise
to
be
an
american
dipa
but
this
is
a
great
beer
nonetheless
ill
be
dishing
out
the
bucks
for
more
brews
from
nogne
if
i
can
still
find
their
offerings
at
a
store
ive
visited
previously
bottle
conditioned
500
ml
courtesy
of
erik
dahl
venner
av
nøgne
ø
i
received
this
remarkable
beer
with
awe
mixed
with
great
anticipation
very
few
litres
of
100
have
been
for
sale
to
the
public
would
i
like
it
or
would
the
massive
hops
80
ibu
be
too
much
for
me
the
cost
of
brewing
it
the
massive
amount
of
malts
and
hops
required
for
a
batch
made
the
brewers
certain
that
it
would
be
unprofitable
as
a
permanent
brew
particularly
with
norwegian
alcohol
taxes
this
impenetrable
cloudy
dark
brown
beer
pours
with
a
large
to
moderate
tan
head
aroma
is
simply
wonderful
colombus
hops
galore
dark
chocolate
leather
cigars
pipe
tobacco
tar
the
complexity
remains
in
the
flavour
extremely
malty
very
sweet
but
also
extremely
bitter
the
bitterness
which
becomes
medicinal
and
wormwoodlike
in
the
aftertaste
prevents
me
from
giving
this
beer
a
full
score
on
a
regular
basis
id
prefer
nøgne
øs
god
jul
which
is
world
class
this
year
imho
and
also
their
porter
but
what
a
great
experiment
100
is
bottle
from
barley
wine
in
copenhagen
then
consumed
later
in
the
hotel
described
as
triple
ipa
by
the
owner
of
barley
wine
and
the
bartender
at
lord
nelson
it
sure
seemed
much
more
like
an
american
strong
ale
to
me
dark
brown
color
too
dark
for
the
style
with
a
expressive
nose
and
a
super
bitter
hoppy
flavor
a
good
brew
but
not
great
bottle
poured
a
dark
brown
color
ale
with
a
nice
medium
foamy
head
with
slightly
better
then
average
retention
aroma
of
bitter
and
slightly
piney
hops
is
mix
with
some
nice
caramel
malt
taste
is
somewhat
reminiscent
of
an
hoppy
porter
maybe
because
of
the
color
with
load
of
roastysweet
caramel
malt
and
a
bitter
and
slightly
piney
finish
body
has
real
creamy
texture
with
medium
carbonation
and
no
alcohol
could
be
detected
if
i
had
to
rate
to
style
then
im
not
sure
this
would
score
very
highly
since
it
is
quite
off
for
the
style
since
i
am
not
rating
to
style
i
thought
this
was
a
really
good
beer
that
doesnt
really
fit
into
a
define
style
had
it
again
two
years
later
appearance
of
black
with
lots
of
lace
and
big
head
aroma
of
barley
and
hops
just
as
big
and
different
good
hops
bitterness
deep
copper
nicely
displayed
beige
head
big
earthy
nose
highly
hoppy
toffeeish
choco
and
caramel
malt
gentle
toastiness
pleases
the
nose
with
makes
you
think
of
a
good
breakfast
as
soon
as
you
grasp
those
maple
notes
greeny
hops
remain
moderate
at
this
point
but
in
mouth
it
feels
far
more
floral
barky
and
sweaty
a
mild
alcohol
aftertaste
surprises
the
drinker
as
this
seemed
so
drinkable
big
brown
ale
base
woody
and
smoky
flavors
rooty
creamy
medium
malty
palate
very
good
indeed
this
is
a
good
standard
barleywine
tasty
nothing
unique
pretty
good
not
crazy
hippy
pretty
balanced
bomb
with
sticky
toffee
pudding
overall
balanced
very
well
not
too
hoppy
sweet
or
boozey
like
it
just
to
clear
my
name
with
all
the
fans
of
this
beer
im
now
opening
another
barley
wine
in
the
wake
of
old
blarney
disappointment
central
waters
bourbon
barrel
barley
wine
oh
yeah
thats
the
stuff
o
definitely
recommended
id
love
to
try
the
barrel
aged
version
old
blarney
pours
a
reddish
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
fruity
and
dry
like
aroma
the
taste
is
dry
with
a
dry
fruity
flavor
and
a
mellow
malty
sharpness
very
easy
to
drink
good
full
body
overall
its
a
solid
barleywine
however
a
bit
on
the
boring
side
overall
this
is
the
first
barley
wine
i
have
had
and
the
first
thing
that
struck
me
is
how
similar
it
is
to
many
beer
styles
i
almost
expected
it
to
be
as
dissimilar
as
spiced
mead
i
have
to
admit
though
it
is
a
fantastically
thick
flavoursome
and
powerful
beer
style
i
think
ive
found
a
new
style
to
keenly
watch
out
for
too
dry
no
hoppiness
left
which
is
fine
but
the
maltiness
is
not
bragging
a
passable
barleywine
this
is
a
tasty
brew
with
all
the
fine
attributes
i
like
in
a
barleywine
i
recommend
it
o
a
pleasant
barleywine
but
nothing
to
rave
about
i
would
have
it
again
and
tentatively
recommend
it
but
not
above
hopsickle
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
brown
with
a
smallish
tan
head
that
persists
for
bit
before
leaving
spotty
lace
on
the
glass
aromas
of
dark
sugars
and
fruits
with
brown
sugar
caramel
cherry
plum
and
orange
providing
the
bulk
of
the
nose
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
brown
sugar
and
caramel
and
lots
of
rich
juicy
dark
fruits
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
earthy
citrus
hops
provide
a
nice
balance
to
mix
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
light
to
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
fruity
slick
mouthfeel
this
a
very
nice
barleywine
its
very
smooth
and
tasty
im
surprised
its
flown
so
far
under
the
radar
until
now
this
is
a
solid
beer
with
solid
flavor
its
rich
sweet
bitter
and
a
tad
boozy
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
did
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
malt
with
some
caramel
with
all
the
barleywines
out
there
im
not
sure
ill
be
having
this
again
a
basic
american
barleywine
uninteresting
on
the
whole
and
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
harsh
pours
a
very
hazy
ruby
red
color
with
a
hint
of
brown
to
it
small
offwhite
head
scent
is
very
sweet
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
slight
toffee
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
initially
alcohol
with
lovely
sweet
dark
fruits
a
lot
of
raisin
and
prune
a
good
amount
of
caramel
malt
with
some
burnt
molasses
flavors
not
overly
boozy
like
some
of
the
reviews
stated
maybe
this
is
an
older
bottle
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
a
little
thin
for
this
style
drinkability
is
fairly
high
somewhat
wellbalanced
overall
this
is
nowhere
near
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
but
it
isnt
a
bad
one
by
any
means
thin
mouthfeel
upfront
with
some
abv
warmth
some
toasty
figs
light
caramelized
prunes
sweet
biscuit
crust
and
maybe
some
sweet
plums
but
keep
in
mind
theres
a
strong
underliying
abv
presence
in
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
the
palate
is
thin
and
warm
this
is
not
a
bad
sipper
keep
in
mind
ive
been
holding
on
to
this
beer
for
over
a
year
and
this
american
barleywine
is
a
bit
too
harsh
i
will
not
buy
again
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
on
the
lower
side
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
very
good
version
of
the
style
i
really
liked
that
even
though
its
an
american
version
the
malts
still
seemed
like
the
star
of
the
show
very
enjoyable
beer
to
sip
on
this
afternoon
doa
pretty
classic
barleywine
not
to
my
tastes
but
its
well
made
o
the
flavors
and
aroma
of
the
beer
are
decent
but
they
are
lacking
a
bit
in
comparison
to
other
barleywines
out
there
this
beer
is
a
deviation
from
the
normal
hop
heavy
and
sweet
american
barleywines
it
is
on
more
of
a
sessionable
level
due
to
this
makes
it
rather
dangerous
almost
more
like
an
imperial
irish
red
than
a
barleywine
pours
a
hazy
dark
red
color
with
a
decent
white
head
smells
like
an
irish
red
with
a
lot
of
dusty
amber
malts
and
a
dry
yeast
variety
flavor
is
similar
but
with
just
a
hint
of
alcoholic
sweetness
characteristic
of
a
barleywine
i
would
never
ever
guess
this
beer
was
ten
percent
ever
mouthfeel
is
really
weird
its
almost
flat
not
from
lack
of
carbonation
exactly
but
from
lack
of
change
from
start
to
finish
it
just
sort
of
sits
there
doing
nothing
i
dont
know
its
not
right
in
a
way
almost
dull
in
the
mouth
but
strong
burn
when
you
hold
it
in
hard
to
explain
overall
a
cool
brew
but
not
a
barleywine
as
i
conceptualize
them
overall
this
was
an
above
average
beer
but
a
par
barleywine
i
like
the
style
but
the
flavors
were
off
and
it
made
for
an
odd
tasting
beer
this
beer
gets
points
for
being
a
smooth
10
barleywine
but
other
than
that
there
are
many
others
id
rather
drink
before
i
would
revisit
this
one
a
delicious
barleywine
that
is
just
a
bit
to
hoppy
for
me
to
love
but
it
is
an
american
bw
afterall
so
im
not
surprised
for
the
style
excellent
my
personal
preference
is
still
more
for
the
english
variety
but
this
is
still
worth
trying
and
ill
enjoy
every
last
drop
a
definite
sipper
though
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
because
i
love
the
style
nothing
amazing
just
a
solid
textbook
barleywine
this
drinks
super
easy
its
not
overly
complex
but
it
didnt
have
to
be
just
a
well
rounded
straightforward
barleywine
not
sure
how
old
this
is
but
seems
to
have
a
little
age
on
it
big
malt
plenty
of
yeast
and
a
nice
citrus
hop
flavor
d
a
balanced
rewarding
drink
plenty
of
interest
here
o
ive
always
enjoyed
this
beer
its
a
solid
barley
wine
o
since
moylans
has
no
dates
on
their
bottles
im
wondering
how
old
this
since
it
has
some
characteristics
of
1
to
2
year
old
barleywine
but
i
believe
this
is
it
probably
at
its
best
so
i
will
review
it
as
such
this
is
a
beer
i
had
a
long
time
ago
probably
05
and
havent
had
since
so
i
wanted
to
revisit
it
great
barleywine
and
at
under
6
a
bomber
a
real
bargain
this
day
and
age
really
good
overall
average
at
best
overallthis
beers
been
sitting
in
my
closet
for
a
long
ass
time
and
i
felt
like
a
barleywine
i
will
not
be
finishing
this
whole
bomber
pass
overall
even
though
it
was
a
steal
at
5
dollars
a
bomber
it
was
about
as
tasty
as
killer
penguin
from
boulder
cant
impress
anyone
with
a
lackluster
barleywine
pours
a
clear
dark
iced
tea
color
with
a
1
inch
puffy
beige
head
that
fades
to
film
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
almost
nonexistent
with
maybe
some
malt
aromas
taste
is
nonexistent
too
the
taste
is
also
super
weak
like
alcohol
mixed
with
water
and
barely
any
malt
flavors
this
beer
has
a
decent
level
of
carbonation
but
seems
a
bit
on
the
flatter
side
overall
this
is
a
bad
beer
with
an
extremely
weak
smell
and
taste
i
really
hope
this
is
a
bad
bottle
because
i
am
very
disappointed
with
this
beer
overall
old
blarney
is
a
barleywine
blended
up
with
a
good
degree
of
bitterness
its
a
decent
brew
not
great
but
good
notes
another
good
quality
offering
from
moylans
a
bit
too
compact
and
repetitive
but
all
in
all
in
a
rather
pleasing
way
i
would
not
mind
having
a
couple
of
bottles
picking
up
some
time
i
think
i
have
had
this
bottle
for
about
a
year
and
i
am
glad
i
opened
it
now
as
this
is
a
fairly
mellow
bw
that
doesnt
need
tons
of
aging
the
beer
is
on
the
softer
side
with
the
hops
in
place
but
mellowed
in
time
i
found
all
the
right
bw
flavours
here
but
in
a
muted
form
which
increased
the
drinkability
but
decreased
the
complexity
not
among
the
best
american
bws
but
nothing
really
off
putting
other
than
bigger
flavours
needed
o
standard
barleywine
semisweet
weird
carbonation
but
didnt
take
away
too
much
maybe
some
age
would
help
out
but
decent
enough
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
with
a
nice
creamy
mouth
feel
alcohol
was
not
very
noticable
despite
the
high
abv
opinion
overall
this
is
a
really
good
example
of
an
american
barley
wine
i
like
the
blending
of
the
hops
to
go
with
the
rather
typical
malt
bill
though
the
hops
are
a
strong
player
in
the
flavor
they
only
modestly
dominate
in
the
finish
aside
from
what
a
lot
of
brewers
think
that
if
they
make
their
ibus
over
double
the
og
they
are
making
a
barley
wine
no
you
are
making
hop
extract
with
malt
and
alcohol
in
it
this
beer
is
well
crafted
and
i
would
put
it
up
on
my
list
of
favorite
american
barley
wines
no
doubt
i
would
definitely
give
this
beer
a
try
regardless
of
what
beer
you
are
into
you
will
probably
like
this
beer
good
carbonation
could
be
toned
down
a
bit
though
not
horrible
but
i
have
to
take
this
one
slow
moylans
bugger
off
overall
after
debating
between
two
barleywines
for
dessert
i
am
very
happy
we
went
this
direction
it
was
an
excellent
choice
to
finish
off
a
fantastic
meal
o
overall
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
example
of
my
favorite
style
if
it
were
in
small
bottles
with
a
date
stamp
this
could
become
a
regular
in
my
cellar
pours
a
slightly
hazy
coppery
reddish
orangish
color
with
a
two
finger
off
white
brownish
head
which
recedes
to
skim
there
is
some
good
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
dark
fruits
mainly
raisin
pepper
and
molasses
the
taste
has
a
caramel
malt
backbone
with
a
big
molasses
and
raisindate
taste
along
with
a
hint
of
tea
there
wasnt
much
if
any
of
a
hop
presence
and
the
dark
fruits
tended
to
dominate
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
slick
with
a
nice
alcohol
feel
the
drinkability
is
average
it
is
an
okay
barleywine
but
not
the
best
in
class
it
was
an
okay
drink
i
took
down
the
bottle
but
didnt
really
desire
any
more
than
that
overall
another
excellent
us
barley
wine
definitely
recommended
dangerous
balanced
and
good
why
i
dont
see
this
barleywine
mentioned
among
others
i
hear
too
often
i
dont
know
a
great
barley
and
one
i
wish
were
local
so
i
could
always
have
a
few
around
appearance
is
a
see
through
dark
brown
with
an
off
white
healthy
head
leaving
a
light
lace
smell
has
a
weak
aroma
of
lightly
roasted
malts
and
dark
fruits
taste
has
a
sweet
roasted
malt
richness
with
a
good
balance
of
hops
leaving
a
roasted
bitterness
in
the
end
mouthfeel
is
heavy
viscous
with
good
carbonation
ive
had
better
but
still
not
bad
for
a
nice
winter
warmer
d
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
theres
not
too
much
about
it
that
is
interesting
either
no
real
reason
to
come
back
to
this
one
with
so
many
other
good
barleywines
out
there
d
rather
bold
not
sure
i
could
handle
more
than
one
bomber
but
really
good
all
around
i
am
pleased
d
if
you
like
american
barleywines
this
one
is
worth
checking
out
drinkable
d
very
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
highoctane
beer
that
seems
to
have
benefited
greatly
from
age
compared
to
the
2008
version
which
i
really
liked
this
was
a
bit
disappointing
similar
overall
but
less
intense
less
fruity
less
vanilla
d
hides
the
10
well
but
the
sweetness
makes
this
hard
to
choke
down
after
a
while
i
woulndt
seek
this
out
but
its
worth
a
try
pours
a
somewhat
murky
mediumbrown
color
with
ruby
highlights
and
about
an
inch
or
ecru
foam
which
quickly
recedes
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
leaving
a
slick
with
bubbles
across
the
top
some
hop
in
the
nose
along
with
some
dark
fruits
plums
and
brown
sugar
on
the
palate
this
one
is
more
malty
with
caramel
brown
sugar
and
some
hops
and
alcohol
on
the
finish
as
said
ill
bet
this
would
do
even
better
with
some
aging
i
guess
heres
where
i
make
another
plea
for
mandatory
bottled
on
dating
would
be
a
great
help
to
us
beer
consumers
who
give
a
crap
about
those
kinds
of
things
as
with
all
moylans
stuff
ive
had
so
far
id
definitely
buy
this
again
have
yet
to
be
let
down
by
moylans
yet
not
blown
away
either
prefer
this
over
the
smutty
i
recently
had
a
little
onenote
and
surprisingly
dry
but
worth
a
try
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
slightly
different
take
on
the
style
overall
i
am
very
surprised
by
the
lack
of
aeromatics
in
this
beer
with
everything
youd
expect
in
a
barleywine
this
one
does
lack
aroma
malt
texture
and
flavor
are
good
with
a
strong
backing
of
alcohol
and
hop
bitterness
step
up
the
malt
complexity
and
give
me
something
to
smell
and
i
think
wed
have
an
even
better
example
of
the
style
overall
and
for
the
price
quite
a
good
barleywine
10abv
is
well
balanced
this
beer
wont
blow
you
away
but
wont
waste
your
money
either
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
barleywine
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
after
being
a
very
big
fan
of
moylans
other
beers
nothing
exceptional
but
nothing
bad
worth
a
shot
im
usually
up
for
trying
barleywines
this
one
is
very
dry
and
seemingly
low
in
malt
balance
almost
makes
me
think
of
a
brown
ipa
with
its
thin
body
not
too
good
overall
not
too
bad
but
not
great
either
i
cant
say
i
would
recommend
buying
a
22oz
and
trying
to
finish
yourself
its
not
quite
that
drinkable
on
the
other
hand
if
you
have
friends
to
share
it
with
or
the
opportunity
to
have
a
sample
then
i
would
recommend
drinkability
this
is
a
damn
good
barleywine
one
22
is
more
than
enough
for
now
but
id
be
happy
to
have
it
again
or
age
one
d
everything
is
well
balanced
goes
down
well
sheets
of
tan
lace
stick
behind
after
drinking
this
orangebrown
brew
sticky
citric
and
herbal
aroma
which
is
strong
but
nothing
special
the
flavor
is
all
of
that
but
really
herbal
besides
citric
zest
up
front
yields
to
pine
resin
and
peppery
herbs
mouthfeel
is
middle
of
the
road
a
little
sticky
and
full
but
relatively
easy
to
drink
not
bad
boozy
too
hot
to
be
really
drinkable
but
all
the
right
notes
are
there
despite
bringing
a
little
heat
this
is
a
pretty
easy
beer
to
go
to
town
on
not
bad
at
all
check
it
out
the
drink
is
silkysmooth
and
luxuriously
fullbodied
with
nearperfect
carbonation
an
excellent
sipper
nice
malt
base
typical
caramel
bread
raisin
along
with
a
nuttyearth
note
touch
of
spiciness
dryer
than
your
typical
barleywine
not
as
sweet
and
rich
citrus
zings
through
the
finish
though
it
suffers
in
my
palate
due
to
the
hopsickle
before
it
still
its
there
and
providing
a
nice
bite
to
the
finish
mellow
not
decadent
mouthfeel
abv
well
hidden
actually
pretty
drinkable
for
the
style
quite
enjoyed
this
actually
moylans
puts
out
some
pretty
darn
good
under
rated
stuff
thanks
again
rob
this
is
a
decent
barleywine
nothing
too
special
and
not
one
id
hunt
down
again
but
im
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
cheers
to
volo
for
bringing
moylans
into
ontario
22oz
bottle
into
a
duvel
snifter
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
thin
khaki
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
and
leaves
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
loads
of
burnt
caramel
and
toast
up
front
with
slight
bitter
hops
present
in
the
background
the
taste
is
loads
of
sweet
caramel
malts
with
slight
brown
sugar
dried
fruits
and
hints
of
molasses
the
hops
are
relegated
to
the
background
but
provide
a
nice
bitter
pine
backbone
to
the
lingering
sweet
finish
the
beer
is
certainly
on
the
heavy
side
and
its
10
abv
shows
up
but
its
not
too
aggressive
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
i
must
say
this
one
certainly
seems
like
it
will
get
much
better
as
it
ages
but
it
is
still
pretty
tasty
right
now
notes
ive
been
impressed
with
every
moylans
beer
ive
had
and
this
is
no
exception
i
wish
i
could
have
experienced
this
one
fresh
to
know
how
the
flavors
have
changed
but
at
an
estimated
age
of
only
one
year
the
flavors
taste
great
and
the
10
abv
is
not
abrasive
or
overwhelming
i
enjoyed
this
sipper
quite
a
bit
recommended
not
bad
at
all
kind
of
a
mix
between
an
english
and
american
barleywine
it
doesnt
quit
work
for
me
but
still
worth
a
try
on
the
lighter
side
of
fullbodied
but
well
carbonated
for
its
body
the
drinkability
is
great
and
two
bombers
is
certainly
not
out
of
reach
a
very
good
brew
even
if
the
style
is
a
little
erratic
a
must
try
for
barleywine
lovers
this
would
be
more
drinkable
if
the
lingering
taste
was
not
so
hot
initially
drinkable
but
the
longering
hot
alcohol
ruins
the
experience
mouthfeel
full
bodied
chewy
syrupy
and
a
sweetness
lingering
beer
poured
a
deep
copper
with
a
nice
long
lasting
off
white
head
nose
is
malts
west
coast
hops
and
some
dark
fruit
taste
is
good
somewhat
sweet
malts
some
dark
fruit
and
a
muted
piney
bitterness
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
is
nice
and
chewy
on
the
palate
overall
drinkability
is
good
this
is
an
easy
sipping
enjoyable
brew
that
is
not
overpowering
it
is
somewhat
different
from
others
in
the
style
perhaps
because
of
the
resinous
finish
definitely
worth
a
shot
nothing
earth
shattering
here
but
this
is
still
a
very
nice
bw
from
moylan
im
guessing
the
3
years
of
aging
have
probably
not
hurt
it
one
bit
frankly
this
bw
tastes
like
it
could
easily
handle
and
benefit
from
another
3
o
this
is
maybe
one
of
the
most
drinkable
barleys
ive
had
finishing
some
barley
bombers
can
be
a
laboring
task
but
not
this
one
if
you
like
your
barleys
more
on
the
english
side
this
one
is
for
you
d
drinkability
score
goes
way
up
with
the
value
on
this
bad
brew
high
abv
but
it
serves
to
accent
more
than
dominate
another
really
really
good
moylans
offering
at
a
great
price
an
unsung
ca
brewery
with
excellentlycrafter
beer
j
color
is
dark
brown
with
some
cherry
red
hues
a
nice
sized
tan
head
quickly
fades
leaving
minimal
lacing
behind
a
strong
chocolate
aroma
initially
rises
to
the
nose
quickly
followed
by
some
sweet
cherries
caramel
malts
and
a
woodsy
essence
on
the
palate
the
sweet
malts
and
hops
duke
it
out
immediately
with
some
more
dark
chocolates
stepping
in
and
breaking
things
up
some
mellow
earthiness
and
more
dark
fruits
exist
a
noticeable
alcohol
heat
seeps
through
after
a
few
sips
halfway
through
the
glass
and
i
start
to
realize
that
this
is
not
a
completely
concerted
effort
as
many
of
the
elements
seem
to
jockey
for
position
rather
than
work
together
that
being
said
this
is
a
fairly
wellintentioned
barleywine
that
could
use
a
few
tweaks
here
and
there
but
remains
pretty
damn
satisfying
as
is
will
have
to
buy
another
bottle
of
this
and
see
how
it
ages
my
guess
is
when
the
hop
bitterness
fades
a
tad
the
malt
will
really
start
to
shine
through
i
have
had
this
numerous
times
and
each
time
i
try
to
like
it
more
and
more
but
for
some
reason
it
never
happens
pours
a
red
colored
body
clear
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
diminishing
hoppy
bitter
sweet
malty
aroma
some
dustiness
and
some
syrupyness
some
sweet
dusty
maltiness
some
roasted
malt
tastiness
not
too
strong
or
overpowering
a
flavor
very
dusty
tasting
had
this
one
with
some
stilton
and
figcinnamon
chutney
on
sourdough
delicious
once
it
warmed
up
an
enjoyable
barleywine
from
moylans
this
is
a
beer
made
for
sharing
with
a
partner
not
that
one
person
cant
enjoy
this
over
a
long
night
cheap
standard
not
extraordinary
but
by
no
means
bad
at
all
there
certainly
are
better
flavors
are
decent
but
not
very
easy
to
drink
maybe
would
improve
with
some
age
overall
i
like
pretty
much
every
offering
ive
had
from
moylans
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
a
solid
barley
wine
that
has
a
little
something
different
going
on
than
most
worth
a
shot
smooth
silky
mouthfeel
that
just
seem
to
slide
down
your
gullet
sure
the
bar
for
ultra
hoppy
high
gravity
ales
is
set
pretty
high
in
california
but
this
sample
might
fail
to
even
qualify
in
preliminaries
simply
a
reflection
of
tough
competition
nothing
from
moylans
has
ever
wowed
me
but
i
know
they
make
more
solid
beers
than
this
not
to
give
the
impression
that
i
didnt
like
the
old
blarney
i
certainly
did
but
if
you
have
the
golden
states
full
repertoire
at
your
fingertips
than
theres
no
need
to
grab
this
one
first
not
really
drinkable
in
my
opinion
i
thought
my
first
attempt
at
drinking
this
barleywine
may
have
been
a
spoiled
batch
or
overhopped
but
twice
in
a
row
left
me
feeling
none
too
pleased
this
barleywine
just
isnt
for
me
notes
im
not
that
impressed
with
moylans
at
all
doesnt
marin
contract
brew
through
them
why
are
their
beers
so
awesome
pours
reddish
brown
with
an
oily
head
viscouslooking
the
aroma
is
awful
like
a
malty
lowtide
the
taste
more
than
makes
up
for
it
heavy
and
sweet
with
malts
and
caramel
the
hops
eventually
fight
through
in
the
end
overall
it
tastes
like
this
beer
should
be
aged
before
bottled
all
that
comes
to
my
nose
is
a
thick
caramel
malt
smells
like
concentrate
of
malt
the
taste
however
is
a
bit
more
pleasing
but
malt
driven
sweet
rich
malty
intro
with
caramel
toffee
tobacco
and
then
some
serious
bittering
hops
piney
and
citric
the
balance
is
ok
leaning
to
the
malt
as
the
aftertaste
is
a
tongue
coated
malty
syrup
the
carbonation
helps
disperse
the
flavors
of
this
viscous
chewy
brew
the
10
abv
does
the
rest
making
this
big
malty
brew
quite
drinkable
i
enjoy
this
type
of
bw
now
and
then
but
prefer
the
hoppier
balance
of
the
sn
bigfoot
none
the
less
enjoyable
purchased
in
la
mesa
ca
at
bevmo
1006
seems
a
bit
past
its
prime
22
oz
bomber
poured
slightly
hazy
copper
to
redorange
and
had
a
fluffy
light
tan
head
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
caramel
dark
fruit
a
bit
of
yeast
and
sweet
pine
hops
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
caramel
and
chocolate
maltiness
dark
fruit
and
a
soft
muted
pine
hoppiness
it
sure
doesnt
seem
like
a
10
abv
beer
no
sense
of
the
alcohol
overall
a
good
barleywine
heavy
on
hops
but
a
strong
amount
of
sweetness
d
this
is
fairly
easy
drinking
for
me
the
taste
may
be
mild
but
there
is
enough
complexity
towards
my
flavors
of
interest
that
i
wont
get
bored
anytime
soon
a
very
good
beer
at
a
nice
price
that
i
will
be
having
again
and
again
overall
this
is
an
unbalanced
mess
it
mellows
out
as
i
drink
though
i
managed
to
finish
the
bomber
d
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
taste
strong
with
burnt
caramel
but
the
malt
seems
to
have
almost
nothing
else
the
hops
totally
overpower
this
with
a
sharp
rough
bitterness
that
rides
roughshod
over
the
tounge
and
everywhere
else
leaving
behind
a
rough
feeling
and
little
taste
except
for
a
sharp
pinegrapefruit
rind
bitterness
its
boring
and
rough
d
overall
not
bad
but
perhaps
this
would
be
better
with
some
age
on
it
the
hops
while
interesting
take
away
from
the
rest
of
this
beer
6
months
in
the
cellar
would
do
this
well
booyaa
i
love
my
day
off
the
smell
was
really
underwhelming
got
some
hop
aroma
but
all
was
very
faint
the
taste
was
caramel
malts
and
good
spiciness
you
could
taste
a
little
hop
bitterness
on
the
way
out
in
the
mouth
it
was
dry
alcohol
was
really
present
and
you
were
left
with
a
real
burnt
caramel
on
the
finish
overall
a
middle
of
the
road
barley
wine
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
this
beer
and
would
have
a
hard
time
spending
the
money
on
another
bottle
i
still
have
trouble
sometimes
telling
the
difference
between
these
hopped
up
barley
wines
and
dipas
i
guess
dipas
should
have
a
lower
final
gravity
or
something
does
that
make
them
a
barleywine
lite
anyway
this
is
a
great
beer
light
red
colour
with
a
nice
big
head
good
retention
with
nice
sticky
lace
aroma
is
at
eleven
big
piney
citrusy
hops
with
a
toffee
like
malt
aroma
as
well
tastes
much
the
same
with
the
addition
of
smooth
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
alchohol
suprisingly
this
beer
isnt
that
boozy
for
the
strength
at
ten
percent
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
really
good
beer
from
a
really
good
brewery
d
i
was
more
apprehensive
than
i
needed
to
be
about
this
beer
maybe
the
style
scared
me
off
not
boozy
like
many
barley
wines
almost
too
easy
to
drink
really
recommend
this
one
the
body
is
moderate
to
big
would
have
like
to
see
more
this
is
a
beer
that
would
probably
be
best
if
aged
the
alcohol
notes
and
the
oxidation
both
would
back
off
and
leave
a
nice
finish
only
one
way
to
try
that
though
see
you
in
a
few
years
dark
orangebrown
color
clear
aromas
of
booze
nail
polishacetone
dark
fruit
leather
and
tobacco
flavors
ash
cheap
chocolate
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
this
is
totally
different
than
any
barleywine
ive
ever
had
and
im
not
sure
i
like
it
d
wonderful
barleywine
great
flavors
complexity
and
balance
highly
recommended
overall
not
bad
but
really
quite
forgettable
i
have
had
much
better
barley
wines
and
this
came
in
good
dont
get
me
wrong
but
i
was
really
looking
for
a
little
bit
more
out
of
it
still
though
more
then
a
solid
call
and
something
i
would
not
mind
going
back
to
again
this
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
and
has
a
creamy
tan
head
nice
lacing
the
nose
has
a
pleasant
mixture
of
floral
hops
candy
and
fruity
malts
the
taste
is
also
very
good
well
balanced
with
a
full
body
a
bitter
base
with
sweet
bready
malts
poking
through
oelergud
poured
a
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
nose
was
weak
but
it
did
have
dried
fruits
brown
sugar
the
abv
is
very
well
disguised
the
dried
fruitsraisins
are
very
prominent
here
not
much
of
a
malt
backbone
brown
sugar
with
some
good
caramel
malt
since
the
abv
was
well
disguised
and
the
overall
taste
is
good
i
give
the
drinkability
a
good
grade
it
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
and
better
at
room
temp
notes
at
times
it
reminded
me
more
of
a
strong
ale
a
la
arrogant
bastard
than
a
barleywine
worth
checking
out
clear
burnt
orange
nearly
reddish
with
a
frothy
light
beige
cap
composed
of
fine
bubbles
chunky
sticky
lacing
and
good
head
retention
i
could
smell
the
hops
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
bottle
after
pouring
the
hops
were
still
there
lots
of
grapefruit
pithy
and
juicy
with
a
little
pine
there
was
a
fair
bit
of
caramel
in
there
too
moderate
bitterness
with
a
ton
of
malty
caramel
kicked
things
off
there
was
a
bit
of
juice
and
spicy
alcohol
in
the
middle
grapefruit
rind
and
citrus
oil
bitterness
really
punched
through
at
the
end
and
lingered
forever
for
a
really
intense
finish
lightly
warming
with
a
full
body
that
was
creamy
and
chewy
carbonation
was
just
on
the
low
side
giving
it
a
rich
smooth
texture
definitely
a
powerful
brew
particularly
in
the
finish
it
satisfied
the
hop
head
in
me
and
left
my
tongue
bruised
and
battered
delicious
a
nice
treat
flavor
is
rich
complex
and
full
bodied
alcohol
is
noticable
but
not
unpleasant
dangerously
easy
to
drink
drinkability
is
pretty
good
definitely
unusual
and
interesting
though
the
flavor
my
not
be
everyones
cup
as
tea
as
its
definitely
not
classic
good
enough
for
me
to
have
at
least
2
or
3
bombers
this
winter
with
plenty
of
other
bws
waiting
for
me
in
the
cellar
pours

light
maroonish

dark

notes

underwhelming
nose
taste
is
moderately
hopped
with
very
light
and
bright
flavor
of
caramel
and
somewhat
plain
bittering
hoppiness
i
didnt
get
any
citrusy
or
fruity
qualities
to
the
hops
at
all
drinkable
and
smooth
with
a
medium
body
and
normal
carbonation
alcohol
is
nicely
held
in
check
for
10
i
thought
not
outstanding
but
i
didnt
have
any
trouble
finishing
my
share
drinkability
this
is
such
a
rich
complex
and
easygoing
brew
especially
when
it
warms
to
room
temperature
but
theres
that
bitterness
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
this
will
certainly
be
a
bottle
ill
get
to
cellar
if
i
can
but
its
certainly
worth
checking
out
and
im
glad
i
did
as
i
said
before
ill
be
trying
as
many
of
moylans
brews
as
i
can
get
my
hands
on
d
solidly
constructed
easy
drinking
and
tasty
barleywine
a
solid
choice
d
extremely
easy
to
drink
for
such
a
potent
brew

alcohol
is
well
disguised

layers

wish
it
was
stronger
in
that
department
because
what
im
smelling
is
very
nice
taste
is
hoppier
than
expected
with
a
bit
of
mint
and
pine
in
the
finish
great
medium
full
body
nice
and
smooth
and
velvety
couldnt
drink
this
all
night
but
i
certainly
enjoyed
it
another
quality
brew
from
moylans
excellent
a
great
effort
by
moylan
d
alright
the
taste
is
mediocre
but
the
rest
is
nice
although
very
alcoholic
id
say
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
fantastic
find
drinks
a
little
slow
but
if
you
like
your
barley
wines

and
settles
as
an

float
leaving
gobs
of
belgian
lacing
in
its
wake
some
3d
the
smell
is
really
good
sweet
creamy
caramel
malt
a
touch
of
molasses
and
cinnamon
the
nose
suggests
a
rich
texture
and
the
mouth
doesnt
disappoint
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
moderately
heavy
a
tad
lighter
than
some
being
slightly
lighter
there
is
less
of
a
lingering
sense
of
richness
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
nose
no
surprises
and
thats
a
good
thing
the
10
abv
is
warming
to
the
chest
but
well
integrated
otherwise
making
it
very
drinkable
enjoying
this
one
highly
recommended
finish
is
nice
not
bad
on
after
taste
really
nice
body
alcohol
and
bubbles
are
just
right
for
a
10er
really
drinkable
granted
1
bottle
is
more
than
enough
d
both
sweet
and
hoppy
bitter
that
never
quite
blends
together
as
well
as
i
would
like
still
a
tasty
beer
overall
another
fine
offering
by
moylans
they
are
a
lesser
known
west
coast
brewer
in
most
parts
their
beer
is
very
good
though
and
should
be
sought
out
full
bodied
with
a
soft
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
after
swallowing
is
not
thick
as
might
be
expected
but
silky
some
sessions
are
hit
some
miss
but
always
we
demand
the
heart
and
soul
of
our
brewmasters
then
we
kneel
before
them
when
they
give
it
to
us
drinkability
is
good
balanced
and
nice
not
quite
as
bold
as
id
expect
but
still
very
good
all
in
all
a
freaking
amazing
beer
not
to
bad
a
bit
on
the
bitter
and
hoppy
side
this
fresh
will
be
interesting
to
revisit
after
a
couple
years
notes
a
quality
barleywine
from
a
fairly
consistent
brewery
worth
trying
especially
for
the
price
d
while
at
10
abv
no
discernable
alcohol
in
tasting
big
taste
that
commands
that
it
be
savored
and
enjoyed
would
recommend
as
it
a
nice
beer
that
i
will
purchase
again
but
drink
one
at
a
time
overall
the
drinkability
was
above
average
not
quite
good
for
me
it
is
a
case
of
being
too
much
on
the
hoppy
side
of
fine
this
tended
to
lessen
the
relaxed
enjoyment
potential
a
decent
beer
if
i
close
my
eyes
pours
a
dark
redish

with
a
nice
thick
rocky

the
malt
and

are

well
this
beer
is
dangerous
as
the
drinkability
is
highvery
high
drinkability
from
what
ive
read
barleywines
are
sippers
i
would
agree
i
finished
the
bomber
but
have
no
desire
to
have
another
right
away
this
is
a
good
beer
just
not
one
that
youll
have
more
than
one
of
in
any
one
sitting
moylans
brews
a
whole
slew
of
good
beer
im
happy
to
report
that
old
blarney
barleywine
style
ale
is
among
their
best
a
fresh
bomber
might
be
too
much
of
an
alcohol
bomb
so
im
glad
i
cracked
the
crown
on
this
bottle
when
i
did
if
you
like
barleywines
and
dont
suffer
from
poor
impulse
control
cellar
a
few
of
these
beauties
and
then
reap
your
reward
cheers
mouthfeel
has
a
solid
medium
body
this
is
a
very
nice
evening
sipper
very
enjoyable
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
beer
from
moylans
but
not
quite
up
to
par
with
their
ipas
give
it
a
try
if
you
are
into
barley
wines
this
is
probably
one
for
aging
a
bit
might
clear
up
and
will
definitely
come
more
into
balance
as
the
hops
blend
in
d
very
drinkable
for
a
ten
percent
barley
wine
the
hops
are
a
little
over
the
top
to
keep
a
very
drinkable
balance
decent
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
barley
wines
in
sum
this
is
a
big
ass
beer
a
lot
to
contemplate
lots
going
on
here
and
a
damn
fine
example
of
the
style
ive
had
a
couple
moylan
beers
before
and
this
one
of
their
best
so
far
mouthfeel
is
moderate
light
and
a
tad
watery
not
very
much
carbonation
but
this
works
well
with
this
style
as
it
lends
to
its
wine
side
drinkability
is

overall
its

a

brew
and
hats
off

them
its
a

i
really
enjoyed
this

the

i
come

anything

to
rave
about
a

barleywine
i
have

better
and

from
this

a
very
good
barleywine
here
it
has
a
nice

with
good

a
wonderful

this
would

a

im
not

there

better
barleywines
out

however
a

quite
the

and
may

to
have
this

definitely
an
after

slow
sipper
i
dont
imagine
too
many
barley

however
this

could
stand
to
work
on
smoothing
out
some
of
the
malts
and
alcohol
maybe
some
time
at
cellar
temps
could
mellow
it
out
traditionally
moylans
isnt
too
shy
with
the
hops
so
its
surprising
this
one
doesnt
have
more
hop
character
not
a
bad
beer
but
needs
some
improvement
taste
is
a
bit
milder
than
other
barleywines
i
have
tried
it
is
certainly
not
unpleasant
though
just
a
bit
muted
a
bit
hoppy
and
alcoholic
upfront
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
on
the
finish
md
decent
mouthfeel
smooth
but
not
like
a
barleywine
needs
more
sweetness
in
the
balance
to
make
it
more
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
with
a
chewy
texture
like
an
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
tight
carbonation
rolls
the
flavors
across
your
palate
with
creamy
smoothness

the

a
fairly
smooth
brew
starts
off
with
a

sensation
that
is
quickly
supplanted

of

the
beer
warms
in

flavors

fruits
appear
a
nice
representative
of
the
style
but
not
as
exceptional
as
moylans
other
brews
beer
is
good
happy
big
bering
a
decent
barleywine
but
not
my
favorite
and
this
kind
of
beer
i
like
to
savor
so
ill
pass
on
getting
another
one
not
sure
if
ill
finish
this

color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to

the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
warm
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
burnt
toffee
and
caramel
malts
its
rich
with
a
mild
hop
presence
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
warming
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
malty
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
its
full
of
caramel
and
roasted
malts
it
has
a
wonderful
burnt
toffee
taste
that
is
complimented
with
a
nice
hoppy
flavor
it
may
be
a
little
too
bitter
which
lessens
the
impact
of
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
damn
good
barleywine
its
rich

is
a

of

bread

maybe
some

and
a

the
flavor
has
a
load
of
citrus
orange

with
some
sweetness
from
the
malt
it
almost
turns
that
orange
into
a
nectarine
the

no

the
beer
is
a
dark
and
murky
chestnut
color
clear
and
topped
with
a
whispy

the
aroma
is
of
malt
and
alcohol
followed
by
hardwood
yeast
dark
ripe

and
peppery
hops
from
the
second
sip
the
beer
is
warming
nice
thick
sweet
and
relatively
fullbodied
its
not
as
deeply
intense
as
it
could
be
and
the
malt
sweetness
begins
to
fade
after
a
few
slips
fairly
bitter
and
hoppy
finish
the
beer
could
be
a
little
more
complex
given
the
style
but
as
said
above
its
enjoyable
and
doesnt
really
have
any
flaws
clean
and
somewhat
yeasty
the
beer
kept
me
interested
until
the
bottle
was
empty
i
would
certainly
buy
another
bottle
mouth
sweet
without
a
good
bitter
finish
a
puckery
metallic
after
taste
thats
not
too
desirable
the
mouthfeel
though
is
very
chewy
and
nice
and
the
alcohol
in
the
exhale
provides
the
sensation
of
some
spiciness
in
the
nose
though
the
alcohol
flavor
is
just
a
bit
too
strong
overall
the
enjoyability
of
this
beer
is
deflated
because
of
the
metallic
taste
although
its
not
particularly
complex
it
could
be
a
highly
drinkable
beer
d
great
malty
barleywine
highly
drinkable
in
my
opinion
huge
beer
excellent
to
end
the
evening
with
pours
a
one

light
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
some
lacing
cloudy
ruby
color
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
roasted
coffee
nose
starts
and
finishes
with
a
burnt
spicey
coffee
flavor

still
its
drinkable
but
there
are
much
better
barleywines

ma
drinkability
wont
let
this
beer
keep
me
from
trying
this
fresh
eventually
down
the
line
not
really
happy
about
this
bottle
but
it
was
drinkable
but
not
by
much
great
bargain
barleywine
that
impresses
fairly
easy
drinking
as
well
drinkability
yeah
the
bottle
will
be
finished
but
im
not
really
into
it
sooo
many
better
barlelywines
and
finishing
this
bottle
was
some
what
of
chore
wine
stained
leather
aroma
of
brandy
rich
deep
fruity
malts
caramel
resinous
hops
and
red
wine
nice
sugary
malts
of
all
types
provide
loads
caramel
and
fruit
flavors
i
would
have
personally
liked
to
see
more
hops
in
this
barley
wine
not
because
i
like
a
hoppy
barley
wine
but
because
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
was
just
a
little
to
overboard
still
though
like
most
barley
wines
this
is
pretty
tasty
bottle

color
with
a

durable

than

maple
syrup
brown
sugar
and
chocolate

balls
dominate
some
faint

make
a
play
in
the
background
revealing
some
orange
and
herbal
spiciness
palate
is
thick
syrupy
and
silky
smooth
very
pleasant
initial
taste
is
a
well
rounded
hit
of
a
malty
dark
fruit
sweetness
but
in
no
way
cloying
kind
of
atypical
for
a
west
coast
bw
to
have
the
malt
profile
dominate
the
hops
but
a
nice
change
it
all
finishes
with
a
late
moderate
hop
bitterness
bringing
in
some
citrus
and
pine
the
10
alcohol
is
incredibly
tame
under
all
the
malt
although
i
prefer
the
hoppier
bws
this
was
a
nice
and
well
done
change
of
pace
with
all
the
straight
forward
malt
sweetness
found
in
this
beer
i
would
suggest
that
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
and
hop
bitterness
would
make
this
more
drinkable
as
a
young
barleywine
as
it
is
though
this
should
age
pretty
well
the
sweetness
should
mellow
considerably
over
the
years
and
the
beer
should
pick
up
lots
of
age
malt
complexity
with
time
as
well
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
now
though
i
just
need
to
make
sure
to
lay
a
couple
of
these
puppies
down
picked
up
during
at
hitime
wine
in
costa
mesa
during
a
recent
visit
to
southern
california
the
22
oz
bomber
featured
a
lot
of
medals
that
old
blarney
had
been
awarded
there
wasnt
any
freshness
dating
but
the
bottle
looked
quite
pristine
the
beer
came
out
deep
clear
copper
in
color
with
a
foamy
clingy
head
that
was
one
finger
thick
the
looks
were
definitely
stately
and
so
was
the
reserved
smell
i
was
greeted
by
an
aroma
that
rather
malty
instead
of
the
bight
west
coast
hop
assault
i
was
anticipating
i
could
detect
some
dully
earthy
and
vaguely
spicy
hoppyness
via
the
nose
the
taste
was
balanced
nicely
between
sweet
and
dry
with
a
constant
back
and
forth
interplay
between
the
flavors
the
malts
won
out
in
the
end
though
with
their
buttery
sweet
flavor
the
hops
were
citric
in
their
acidity
and
moderate
in
bitterness
there
was
a
brief
hint
of
peat
smoke
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
thick
gritty
and
teeth
coatingly
sticky
i
found
the
beer
to
be
somewhere
between
the
english
and
the
american
barleywine
styles
while
this
is
a
great
beer
it
didnt
quite
have
the
intensity
of
flavors
displayed
by
the
best
american
examples
like
bigfoot
old
crustacean
and
old
ruffian
it
also
lacked
the
smooth
mellowness
that
great
english
examples
like
old
nick
and
j
w
lees
exhibit
so
well
so
lets
call
it
an
irish
barleywine
and
so
the
old
blarney
moniker
makes
sense
after
all
old
blarney
is
warm
oaken
brown
with
a
glowing
fruity
aroma
hinting
at
melon
an
initially
vigorous
outpouring
of
co2
soon
slows
to
a
persistent
flow
of
tiny
bubbles
fighting
their
way
upwards
through
the
dense
body
the
flavor
is
kind
though
not
particularly
abundant
especially
in
comparison
to
moylans
other
more
charismatic
offerings
simple
contours
of
maltiness
and
bittering
coexist
in
harmonious
balance
though
i
found
it
odd
that
the
bottle
housed
no
yeasted
lees
the
10
alcohol
never
really
makes
itself
known
overall
there
is
a
nice
maple
syrup
taste
that
envelops
this
beer
its
not
too
sweet
or
sugray
but
the
ingredients
blend
nicely
to
create
a
highly
drinkable
barley
wine
its
full
to
be
sure
and
nicely
rounded
an
excellent
example
of
the
west
coast
style
american
barleywine
drinkability
understandably
limited
at
10
abv
but
extremely
approachable
and
quaffable
good
choice
for
a
tasting
as
an
intro
to
the
style
first
sip
reveals
a
smooth
bodied
brew
with
very
mild
carbonation
and
a
slightly
syrupy
texture
that
i
always
enjoy
when
present
in
a
barleywine
flavor
is
toffee
sweet
with
ripe
pears
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
raisin
again
the
piney
hops
make
a
cameo
on
the
finish
quite
a
nice
beer
that
gives
a
bit
of
warming
in
the
belly
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
with
the
dark
malts
as
well
as
a
lot
of
raisin
sweetness
the
alcohol
isnt
as
obvious
in
the
flavor
the
raisins
take
a
large
presence
in
the
flavor
as
do
some
caramel
malts
but
nothing
is
over
the
top
here
smooth
and
balanced
very
nice
easy
to
drink
and
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
pours
a
nice
ambered
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
sits
atop
and
coats
the
beer
the
nose
is
nice
with
slight
raisin
sweetness
a
wiff
of
alcohol
and
some
sweet
caramel
the
flavor
is
balanced
ot
too
big
or
too
small
good
sweet
and
slight
caramel
and
a
hint
of
roasted
a
nice
spicey
and
woody
hop
hits
on
the
finish
i
like
the
balance
the
feel
is
thick
and
slightly
syrupy
i
find
this
to
be
a
well
rounded
american
barleywine
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
i
like
it
big
thumbs
wait
how
many
do
i
have
well
theyre
all
going
up
up
up
drinkable
but
could
be
smoother
the
hoping
is
a
bit
rough
might
improve
with
aging
drinkability
is
solid
to
good
fairly
typical
barelywine
that
is
a
tad
to
onedimensional
no
distinctive
malt
or
hop
profiles
to
make
it
memorable
good
beer
just
not
great
beer
pours
a
rich
copper
with
a
creamy
one

that
that
settles
nicely
leaving
some
light

intese

with
some
underlying

very
noticeable
pine
wow
a

flavorful
barleywine
very
pacific

piney

with

pretty

looks
aint
everything
this
is
definitely
a
west
coast
style
barleywine
in
its
true
form
the
pour
leaves
a
copper
bronzish
color
with
a
medium
tan
head
that
soon
dissipates
to
just
barely
covering
the
beer
the
aroma
on
this
beer
is
very
strong
and
bold
i
notice
berries
combined
with
honey
and
then
hops
added
on
to
that
really
nice
the
beer
is
thick
and
syruppy
in
body
this
is
definitely
a
big
strong
beer
alcohol
hits
my
tongue
almost
instantly
and
stays
with
me
the
whole
time
all
the
way
down
my
belly
the
malts
and
hops
keep
striking
me
back
and
forth
with
neither
taking
control
but
both
showing
their
precense
the
malts
were
quite
sweet
with
caramel
apple
and
figs
at
first
the
hops
came
in
big
waves
with
a
piney
flavor
but
never
really
bitter
theres
a
creamy
body
that
goes
along
with
the
sweetness
and
hoppiness
that
most
moylans
beers
seem
to
have
that
berry
smell
is
noticeable
in
the
taste
the
further
i
go
the
hop
strike
maintains
itself
in
the
aftertaste
but
theres
not
much
bitterness
though
maybe
because
of
the
sweetness
the
hops
arent
really
complex
but
they
mix
well
with
the
alcohol
the
finish
lingers
but
again
has
a
good
mixture
of
malts
hops
and
alcohol
this
is
like
a
better
version
of
the
hog
heaven
from
avery
a
big
beer
with
tons
of
ingredients
and
hops
sounds
like
a
west

beer
to
me
but
im
not
complaining
pours

definate

well
done
this
brewery
is
quickly
becoming
a
favorite
of
mine
22oz
bomber
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
quickly
departing
off
white
head
that
leaves
no
evidence
of
its
existence
shortly
after
this
smells
of
sweet
fruits
and
some
floral
hops
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
lurking
about
very
hopped
up
front
on
the
taste
with
malty
sweetness
following
shortly
after
it
finishes
with
a
dry
and
bitter
taste
that
lingers
for
a
while
and
alcohol
is
quite
warming
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
thick
and
this
is
quite
drinkable
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
not
one
of
the
best
of
its
style
this
one
has
a
beautiful
ruby
brown
body
with
a
light
khaki
head
that
explodes
out
of
the
bottle
irritation
from
having
to
wait
to
let
it
settle
keeps
this
from
getting
a
5
on
appearance
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
good
bit
of
piney
hops
the
flavor
is
caramel
apples
supported
by
a
firm
bitterness
the
malts
are
soft
and
the
hops
are
metallicly
hard
which
actually
makes
for
a
nice
contrast
the
burps
come
up
like
creosote
though
a
solid
barleywine
from
california
and
not
surprisingly
very
hoppy
as
well
though
this
isnt
one
of
the
classics
of
the
style
id
still
have
it
again
this
barley
wine
poured
a
color
a
little
darker
than
oxidized
steel
perhaps
a
rusty
blood
color
one
finger
off
white
head
that
quickly
becomes
a
rocky
cover
the
aroma
is
sweet
flowers
and
dark
fruits
and
a
little
spiciness
kinda
sweet
maybe
caramel
at
the
first

unknown
vintage
a
dark
red
colour
with
ruby
edges
and
a
thin
off
white
head
of
foam
aromas
are
extremely
hoppy
with
booze
and
sweet
caramel
malts
in
the
mix
as
well
the
taste
is
very
hoppy
up
front
with
a
huge
malt
backbone
and
tons
of
sweetness
in
the
middle
the
finish
is
dry
and
lingering
and
very
reminiscent
of
double
bastard
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
not
cloying
and
the
drinkability
is
excellent
dark
amber
with
golden
head
there
are
little
sediments
present
in
the
beer
the
smell
is
very
nice
with
floral
hints
and
a
high
fruity
hoppiness
the
taste
is
smooth
and
almost
like
syrup
with
flavors
of
caramel
molasses
citrus
fruits
and
spices
a
delicious
blend
of
spices
and
strong
malts
and
the
alcohol
pleasantly
warms
the
stomach
very
nice
aftertaste
of
strongold
malts
and
a
hint
of
pine
a
nice
barleywine
delicious
clear
amber
in
color
with
very
little
carbonation
and
a
very
meager
head
the
aroma
is
surprisingly
citric
with
a
noticeable
fairly
medicinal
alcohol
scent
the
flavor
starts
off
with
a
brownsugar
maltiness
quite
hoppy
in
the
finish
with
an
aftertaste
that
as
at
once
bitter
and
sugary
sweet
alcohol
has
a
bit
too
much
bite
in
the
rear
leading
this
beer
to
be
both
harsh
and
cloyingly
sweet
at
the
same
time
something
of
an
accomplishment
i
suppose
full
bodied
and
a
bit
oily
in
texture
the
flavor
does
improve
as
you
work
your
way
down
the
bottle
though
that
might
just
be
the
alcohol
talking
adding
the
yeast
seems
to
help
too
i
like
moylan
i
really
do
and
so
i
was
surprised
at
my
disappointment
with
this
beer
but
then
consider
their
christmas
ale
a
bit
of
an
uneven
brewery
this
22
ounce
bottle
no
date
in
sight
everything
works
out
but
it
really
doesnt
come
together
the
parts
are
greater
than
the
whole
sampled
at
from
the
vine
beer
tasting
jan
9th
2004
this
beer
is
a
deep
ruddy
amber
color
with
a
medium
thick
light
tan
head
sticky
thin
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
caramel
along
with
a
bit
of
hops
rich
and
smooth
with
a
lot
of
malt
up
front
as
well
as
some
citrus
and
hops
for
good
balance
the
finish
is
lightly
bitter
and
a
little
earthy
overall
another
solid
offering
from
moylans
this
beer
poured
a
very
murky
amber
brown
color
no
doubt
sediment
and
carbonation
present
in
that
murky
mess
that
formed
an
off
white
bubbly
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
an
aroma
of
malt
carmel
some
citrus
and
alcohol
present
as
well
the
flavor
was
full
of
malt
caramel
with
some
cocoa
and
coffee
elements
the
body
was
quite
creamy
and
of
a
medium
texture
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
a
very
rich
heavy
barley
wine
that
would
probably
be
even
better
with
some
cellaring
drinkability
is
clearly
limited
on
this
bad
boy
but
if
i
could
choose
one
dessert
glass
of
beer
each
day
this
might
be
it
great
beer
from
moylans
remember
the
name
as
youll
hear
a
lot
more
from
this
brewer
if
you
want
to
get
ripped
this
beer
is
for
you
this
monstrous
10
abv
brew
poured
a
deep
reddish
amber
that
had
an
unfiltered
look
tannish
head
shrunk
down
but
a
thin
layer
remained
lacing
was
wispy
and
scattered
sweet
malt
aroma
was
very
inviting
same
sweet
malts
balanced
nicely
with
some
aggressive
hopping
thick
chewy
mouthfeel
was
perfect
for
this
style
while
ten
percenters
are
not
my
norm
i
found
this
heavy
duty
ale
quite
drinkable
it
didnt
have
the
rawness
of
rogues
and
though
i
havent
had
anchors
old
foghorn
in
sometime
i
think
this
stands
up
quite
nicely
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
night
this
is
a
big
thick
chewey
beer
its
like
a
meal
in
a
bottle
you
wont
drink
many
of
these
at
a
session
but
you
wont
need
many
given
its
10
abv
22oz
bomber
pours
a
color
just
like
apple
cider
and
just
as
unfiltered
looking
has
thick
white
head
that
dies
quickly
yet
leaves
some
serious
lacing
a
sweet
malt
aroma
tells
me
this
is
brewed
to
style
and
unlike
the
other
hopped
up
american
barley
wines
ive
experienced
recently
malt
is
strong
and
sweet
here
this
is
as
full
a
body
as
ive
tasted
in
this
style
smooth
with
a
warming
alcohol
kick
at
the
end
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
with
notes
of
fruit
overall
a
nice
barley
wine
that
seems
brewed
to
style
in
my
opinion
cheers
drinkability
great
entry
level
barleywine
and
economical
to
boot
a
good
one
to
have
now
and
then
but
not
worthy
of
a
special
occasion
appearance
this
massive
beer
pours
a
beautifully
hazed
mahogany
amber
tone
topped
by
a
conservative
tan
head
beautiful
small
etched
even
lacing
very
fine
but
concentrically
formed
aroma
sticky
and
juicy
layers
of
hops
with
the
barleywine
malts
very
rich
malt
treat
forming
the
base
to
be
topped
with
copious
amounts
of
piney
west
coast
hops
glazed
with
caramel
or
butterscotch
very
rich
and
warming
good
for
the
olfactories
taste
challenging
complex
tones
but
oh
so
rich
and
fulfilling
juicy
sweetness
to
the
hop
and
malt
combo
wow
this
is
good
stuff
the
pine
cone
like
hop
tone
dominates
just
enough
doesnt
overbear
the
palate
creamy
tones
rush
between
the
pauses
of
the
bursts
of
the
rediculous
amount
of
malt
and
powerful
hop
presence

good

drinkability
the
alcohol
presence
isnt
overbearing
toward
the
flavor
but
i
bet
after
a
big
bottle
of
this
one
it
hits
you
pretty
decently
so
it
all
depends
how
you
judge
the
drinkability
i
judge
it
on
the
basis
that
if
i
could
i
would
have
bottle
after
bottle
this
beer
seems
like
the
one
i
would
go
for
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
full
bodied
lucious
barley
wine
i
think
its

not

despite
being
10
by

nice
beer
for
all
its
sweetness
this
brew
had
a
very
noticeable
dryness
that
did
not
make
it
seem
as
big
as
a
lot
of
other
barley
wines
plus
the
flavors
themselves
were
more
subdued
than
any
other
beer
of
this
style
that
i
have
ever
had
except
for
maybe
old
foghorn
however
it
was
still
very
enjoyable
actually
the
dryness
made
it
even
more
drinkable
than
a
lot
of
heavier
beers
of
this
style
overall
a
warming
impressive
dark
fruity
barleywine
from
moylans
highly
recommended
the
aroma
of
this
beast
was
deep
brown
in
color
with
red
highlights
when
backlit
it
had
an
amazing
thick
opal
colored
head
about
two
fingers
thick
the
aroma
was
of
roasted
malt
carmel
floral
hop
right
at
the
beginning
and
alcohol
the
taste
when
cold
was
very
very
hoppy
with
a
small
malt
character
but
as
it
warmed
that
is
where
it
got
really
good
the
malt
grew
and
became
very
well
balance
and
very
alcoholic
it
had
a
super
dry
hop
finish
and
thick
mouthfeel
this
is
a
delicious
beer
its
balanced
in
the
sense
that
theres
so
much
of
everything
that
no
one
thing
can
dominate
amazingly
its
quite
drinkable
even
cool
unconscionably
drinkable
for
10
warm
its
heaven
a
well
put
together
beer
that
has
a
complexity
that
is
interesting
pours
amber
in
color
with
a
reasonable
size
cream
color
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
thin
sheet
covering
the
treasure
beneath
the
aroma
is
very
piney
with
some
floral
qualities
the
pineyhoppy
aroma
took
me
by
surprise
given
my
previous
barleywines
had
a
much
more
subdued
hop
character
the
hoppiness
continues
into
the
taste
as
well
the
initial
taste
was
quite
bitter
and
the
hops
abound
as
i
progressed
through
the
bottle
i
found
the
sweet
malt
to
balance
the
hops
very
well
i
tasted
caramel
coffee
and
hints
of
nuts
as
well
hops
are
very
present
throughout
the
beer
i
have
to
say
that
at
this
point
prefer
less
hop
character
still
a
good
beer

pronounced
dark
caramel
malt
sweetness
upfront
in
flavor
is
ceded
and
offset
by

fruitiness

mild
and
indirectly
perceptible
by
a
concentrated

that
emerges
mid

surfaces
late
and

it

is
a
tasty
and
unique
barleywine
other
than
the
dominant
caramel
malt
profile
there
wasnt
great
depth
of
character
however
its
more
of
a
dessert
barleywine
than
an
everyday
sipper
a
vaporous
cherry
red
color
as
it
pours
from

the

very

and
almost
cloying

not

the

there

theres
