on
cask
at
the
brewery
nice
body
and
feel
was
not
impressed
with
this
ipa
no
info
on
can
no
date
abv
or
ibu
i
think
i
bought
a
old
can
info
on
the
can
helps
you
know
the
bros
rankings
are
sometimes
quite
high
on
beers
that
dont
overwhelm
the
denizens
of
ba
however
i
think
that
they
just
nail
a
lot
of
them
they
are
not
afraid
to
give
high
marks
to
stuff
that
is
in
my
experience
just
plain
good
without
the
hype
im
in
no
way
saying
that
all
of
ba
is
a
bunch
of
hype
helpers
but
this
is
one
case
where
its
like
wow
this
is
a
really
unique
beer
for
many
reasons
and
the
bros
score
is
right
in
line
with
mine
though
mine
of
course
is
just
an
opinion
and
i
will
say
that
there
are
many
man
many
more
qualified
raters
than
i
however
its
really
all
opinion
in
a
sense
blathering
but
just
loved
this
and
like
a
very
adept
review
that
is
below
mine
was
blown
away
by
the
beer
after
i
had
seen
such
mediocre
ratings
sometimes
you
wonder
how
much
thought
is
being
out
into
the
ratings
its
always
like
there
is
this
regression
to
the
mediocre
mean
how
many
beers
rank
from
8186
a
huge
majority
i
would
believe
and
many
of
us
call
this
mediocre
well
in
this
case
youre
missing
out
if
you
dont
try
it
besides
its
got
a
dead
horse
on
the
bottle
what
better
to
do
than
beat
it
which
is
what
i
seem
to
be
doing
i
didnt
expect
that
much
as
this
is
not
a
particularly
famous
beer
and
the
ba
score
is
rather
low
i
was
pleasently
suprised
by
the
strong
malt
and
delicious
hops
of
this
english
style
ipa
very
clean
profile
very
different
than
most
ipas
now
a
days
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
it
nice
traditional
ipa
bonus
half
point
for
the
name
appreciate
that
they
went
for
something
different
here
but
def
not
my
style
of
ipa
all
malt
and
no
hops
not
a
drain
pour
but
the
balance
of
the
sixer
may
be
giveaways
o
why
is
it
called
dead
horse
ipa
because
you
cant
beat
a
dead
horse
rimshot
this
is
a
brand
that
those
who
were
around
in
the
early
days
of
craft
beer
will
remember
fondly
after
a
long
hiatus
the
brand
is
looking
to
make
a
comeback
brewing
and
canning
out
of
wachusett
the
liquid
itself
is
tasting
quite
good
however
i
worry
about
its
potential
to
make
an
impact
in
the
market
again
the
beer
landscape
has
changed
a
lot
and
its
so
much
more
competitive
now
mcneills
cant
just
rely
on
their
old
customer
base
to
get
by
they
need
to
actively
solicit
new
drinkers
in
a
completely
different
and
much
younger
demographic
their
name
means
nothing
to
these
people
and
without
an
active
sales
force
and
more
aggressive
marketing
they
will
probably
just
end
up
as
another
hokeylooking
can
on
the
shelf
collecting
dust
it
doesnt
help
that
the
market
is
preferring
the
more
aggressive
west
coast
style
ipas
to
the
more
english
versions
of
the
style
these
days
i
really
wonder
what
mcneills
current
ambitions
are

o
mcneills
dead
horse
ipa
isnt
a
bad
beer
it
just
is
kind
of
average
and
seems
like
it
hasnt
been
updated
to
keep
up
with
modern
changes
in
beers
things
like
brightening
the
hops
or
adding
a
more
poignant
malt
quality
might
go
a
long
way
to
making
this
a
more
interesting
and
enjoyable
brew
cheers
d
a
bit
rustic
in
hop
character
look
and
feel
minimal
caramelly
malty
richness
for
an
english
ipa
sort
of
leaning
a
bit
to
an
esb
or
a
big
pale
definitely
english
in
character
i
would
like
more
umph
from
the
hops
and
more
richness
to
the
malts
but
all
said
and
done
this
one
is
alright
serve
it
on
the
warmer
side
though
delicious
must
try
hazy
auburn
pour
fluffy
head
that
is
quite
resilient
nose
contains
hops
bread
fruit
and
yeast
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
fruit
bread
and
hops
hops
are
minimal
considering
that
its
an
ipa
alcohol
does
make
itself
felt
especially
on
the
finish
low
carbonation
makes
this
a
smooth
easy
drink
its
a
pleasant
brew
but
doesnt
stand
out
considering
the
great
selection
of
ipas
available
certainly
worth
drinking
though
handsome
bottle
btw
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
very
light
haze
to
it
the
head
was
a
little
thin
on
this
one
kind
of
surprising
i
though
for
the
amount
of
hops
that
was
probably
in
it
the
smell
was
hoppy
and
really
gave
off
a
nice
inviting
aroma
the
taste
had
a
nice
hop
character
to
it
also
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
in
the
watery
or
thin
side
i
think
could
have
been
a
bit
thicker
for
me
overall
i
liked
the
flavor
of
the
beer
a
lot
bottle
poured
a
deep
cloudy
caramel
color
ale
with
a
nice
thick
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
consists
of
light
bitter
hops
with
light
floral
undertones
with
a
rich
caramel
malt
base
taste
is
also
a
well
balanced
mix
between
some
floral
and
lightly
bitter
hops
with
a
rich
caramel
mal
bill
with
just
enough
sweetness
to
balance
the
hops
profile
body
is
full
with
limited
filtration
and
good
carbonation
i
understand
this
is
not
an
ipa
for
hophead
but
the
malt
bill
is
quite
incredible
and
i
would
love
to
have
this
more
often
an
excellent
summer
ipa
when
you
want
a
tasty
hoppy
fullbodied
beer
without
too
much
alcohol
o
with
exception
of
the
nose
an
adequate
ipa
with
moderate
drinking
results
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
recommend
or
buy
again
but
wouldnt
discourage
for
the
english
drinking
ipa
fan
overall
a
nicely
drinkable
mostly
english
ipa
overall
i
figured
i
try
this
one
out
since
i
have
never
had
it
before
the
eipa
is
pretty
mild
mannered
compared
to
the
aipa
i
am
accustomed
to
drinking
maybe
i
was
looking
for
more
but
i
was
slightly
amused
by
this
beer
i
would
like
to
try
this
beer
on
draft
someday
to
get
a
better
feel
for
it
maybe
eipas
are
more
mild
and
this
is
how
they
normally
taste
i
will
have
to
try
a
few
times
to
really
understand
this
type
of
beer
d
a
nice
ale
chewy
and
hoppy
without
going
overboard
on
either
side
and
another
beer
to
check
off
in
my
michael
jackson
book
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
light
pale
and
crystal
malt
scent
the
hop
aroma
is
faint
at
best
english
noble
hops
peak
through
but
not
as
much
as
most
traditional
english
ipas
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
bitter
flavor
that
melds
with
a
traditional
pale
and
crystal
malt
character
its
not
overly
bitter
and
it
finishes
a
tad
thin
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
well
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
average
ipa
its
lacking
depth
and
hop
character
i
wont
search
this
one
out
again
d
not
as
good
as
the
last
mcneills
brew
i
had
i
could
have
another
but
not
craving
it
this
was
a
huge
letdown
after
really
enjoying
the
mcneills
oatmeal
stout
last
spring
i
will
probably
remain
very
wary
of
purchasing
from
them
again
smooth
and
creamy
feel
but
just
a
tad
bit
too
harsh
and
bitter
for
my
liking
it
was
ok
but
not
something
id
seek
out
again
i
had
a
sixteen
ounce
pour
of
this
at
the
amsterdam
ale
house
in
manhattans
upper
west
side
i
was
told
by
someone
else
that
it
tasted
like
an
esb
which
made
sense
since
it
was
an
english
style
ipa
i
liked
it
a
lot
like
an
english
ipa
very
dark
in
color
and
a
little
light
on
the
hops
very
good
flavor
with
a
good
malt
character
ill
have
this
again
i
did
not
know
that
dead
horse
ipa
was
an
english
ipa
when
i
ordered
and
only
found
now
here
on
ba
i
think
that
this
beer
could
use
a
more
complex
and
larger
grain
bill
and
hop
profile
either
to
make
it
more
like
the
english
or
american
versions
of
an
ipa
to
me
it
seems
more
like
a
standard
pale
ale
drinkability
very
smooth
did
not
intend
to
drink
the
22oz
but
it
was
too
good
to
share
pours
hazy
orange
with
a
medium
head
the
aroma
is
slight
and
steely
the
flavor
is
malty
and
bready
with
light
caramel
and
some
light
floral
hops
there
is
a
strong
metallic
bite
a
citrusy
bitterness
sneaks
in
late
with
a
sticky
thick
mouthfeel
this
is
an
interesting
diversion
for
ipa
fans
seeking
an
alternative
to
the
norm
pours
a
hazy
yelloworange
with
a
below
average
white
head
minor
lacing
a
bready
yeasty
buttery
toasted
malt
starts
off
and
some
pine
and
citrus
hops
balance
the
beer
decently
nothing
really
stands
out
and
even
a
little
bland
good
balance
but
lacking
true
flavor
still
a
decent
brew
d
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
but
it
didnt
seem
interesting
enough
to
make
me
want
to
have
another
hi
folks
in
nh
for
work
and
scored
a
bottle
of
dead
horse
ale
at
a
gas
station
quickie
mart
my
first
review
im
not
impressed
by
cloudiness
in
an
ipa
the
bottle
is
marked
best
before
last
day
of
feb
no
year
its
june
2010
my
take
on
this
beer
is
very
similar
to
the
rest
of
the
reviews
no
excessive
head
pours
just
fine
the
aroma
is
a
bit
dusty
to
me
and
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
a
citrusybelgianspicy
flavor
that
imo
is
not
hops
and
detracts
from
the
what
i
expect
from
an
ipa
i
cant
i
dont
think
taste
cloudiness
but
it
looks
nice
and
orange
with
a
bit
of
lacing
around
the
glass
and
the
cloudiness
is
not
right
imo
if
i
was
sitting
in
a
pub
in
england
and
drinking
this
from
a
cask
maybe
id
think
it
was
like
an
old
time
ale
but
its
way
different
from
ipas
and
bitters
and
best
bitters
and
cask
ales
ive
had
in
england
so
ill
drink
it
but
wont
buy
another
and
wont
be
requesting
it
in
trade
d
enjoyable
but
nothing
special
here
a
decent
english
ipa
nothing
exceptional
but
less
than
4
for
a
bomber
its
hard
to
beat
that
at
price
this
beer
was
muddy
looking
but
had
a
nice
bouquet
and
mouthfeel
it
had
a
nice
dry
hoppiness
at
the
finish
with
a
breif
maltiness
to
start
the
drinkability
was
good
so
i
could
definately
knock
back
quite
a
few
of
these
overall
an
exellent
beer
apparently
i
need
to
be
a
bit
more
long
winded
with
these
reviews
so
ill
also
say
that
having
the
name
of
the
brewery
etched
on
each
glass
was
a
nice
touch
i
think
that
makes
250
words
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
d
i
could
definitely
have
a
whole
bomber
myself
with
no
problem
but
i
probably
wouldnt
want
to
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
the
big
belgian
presence
doesnt
seem
to
come
together
with
everything
else
the
mustiness
is
really
unique
but
no
altogether
pleasing
pretty
good
pours
a
three
finger
cream
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
cloudy
amber
color
light
to
medium
carbonation
and
lightmedium
bodied
piney
hop
nose
flavor
is
hops
and
tart
citrus
light
lingering
bitter
finish
similar
to
their
dipa
but
lighter
bodied
not
as
hoppy
as
some
american
ipas
2
99
for
a
22oz
bottle
from
beverage
warehouse
winooski
vt
overall
a
very
solid
ipa
i
have
been
fairly
impressed
with
everything
that
i
have
had
come
out
of
mcneils
so
far
i
have
to
say
liked
it
so
much
on
tap
i
wanted
to
see
how
it
stood
up
in
the
bottle
22oz
brown
bomber
served
in
a
standard
pint
freshness
dating
not
indicated
on
the
bottle
poured
a
hazy
burnt
orange
with
a
rocky
three
inch
offwhite
head
layers
of
bubbles
formed
the
base
while
pock
marks
formed
the
cap
head
eventually
settles
into
a
solid
quarter
inch
layer
thick
textured
clumps
of
lacing
were
revealed
as
the
brew
was
consumed
nose
is
a
little
earthy
musty
with
a
hint
of
spice
taste
consistent
with
nose
earthy
and
spicy
with
a
peppery
quality
at
the
back
some
floral
hops
character
is
detectable
in
the
mix
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
a
little
oily
with
a
carbonation
level
that
approaches
prickly
fairly
complex
and
interesting
for
the
style
a
little
left
of
center
but
definitely
worth
a
try
although
i
have
to
say
i
enjoyed
it
on
draft
a
little
bit
more
cant
wait
to
try
it
on
cask
hop
oil
and
a
buttery
malt
in
front
before
getting
whomped
with
a
heavy
woody
hop
and
lemon
pepper
laden
bitter
in
back
almost
like
two
beers
in
one
reviewed
on
06052009
bottle
at
pprbsg09
pours
a
cloudy
orange
aroma
of
tropical
fruits
caramel
malt
citrus
flavor
has
a
nice
balance
of
the
caramel
malt
and
citrusy
hops
slight
astringency
and
harshness
in
the
palate
but
overall
pretty
decent
i
liked
this
one
from
the
1
pint
6
fl
oz
bottle
with
a
julyaugust
notched
off
expiration
date
sampled
on
july
8
2009
it
pours
a
cloudy
amberorange
tone
with
a
frothy
tan
head
that
remains
foamy
and
frothy
through
the
sampling
the
aroma
is
more
like
yeast
spices
and
malts
and
the
hops
seem
almost
secondary
espcially
as
i
am
sampling
an
ipa
but
the
flavor
tells
a
different
story
the
floral
hops
are
omnipresent
with
every
sip
a
nice
surprise
garys
in
portsmouth
has
started
carrying
some
mcneills
beers
so
far
ive
had
two
ipas
and
the
porter
i
hope
theyll
be
getting
more
because
im
liking
this
brewery
and
my
likelihood
of
getting
to
brattleboro
is
not
great
in
a
pint
glass
this
beer
was
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
it
had
a
pronounced
malt
aroma
and
was
also
somewhat
floral
citrus
pine
and
malt
were
all
present
in
the
taste
i
thought
this
beer
was
wellbalanced
and
a
nice
example
of
an
english
ipa
this
is
clearly
an
english
style
ipa
from
a
very
traditional
interpretation
of
the
style
if
you
are
looking
for
a
wildly
hopped
up
american
ipa
or
a
nouvelle
ipa
with
gobs
of
orange
burst
and
blossom
than
there
will
be
some
definite
readjustment
necessary
the
beer
is
a
lot
more
caramelly
than
one
would
expect
there
is
a
wooden
cask
type
residue
underneath
with
lots
of
phenols
bready
citrus
a
touch
of
orange
rind
some
earthy
and
grassy
notes
to
this
beer
my
only
real
criticism
is
that
the
beer
is
way
too
watery
for
its
own
good
this
beer
needs
some
thickening
up
in
the
worst
way
there
is
a
cloying
almost
syrupy
sweetness
to
the
beer
there
are
sweet
malts
running
all
over
the
place
as
well
it
just
needs
a
firmer
body
maybe
a
touch
more
hop
bite
to
balance
out
the
sweet
almost
bubblegum
sugariness
the
beer
is
cloudy
dirty
water
amber
with
not
much
head
retention
and
no
lacing
the
beer
is
definitely
carbonated
easy
to
drink
if
this
had
a
higher
abv
it
would
have
some
brandy
like
qualities
to
it
there
is
also
a
bit
of
carboard
mustiness
in
the
nose
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
malt
and
butter
caramel
and
maybe
some
floral
hops
if
i
squint
close
my
eyes
and
inhale
taste
is
sweet
malts
caramel
toffee
and
butter
very
little
hops
in
the
aroma
or
flavor
i
had
to
call
my
wife
over
to
verify
that
i
wasnt
nuts
but
there
is
very
little
hops
to
be
found
medium
body
and
carbonation
sticky
mouthfeel
if
they
had
called
this
a
bitter
i
would
have
scored
it
much
higher
an
ipa
this
is
not
maybe
there
was
some
mix
up
at
bottling
time
but
i
have
to
assume
that
this
is
supposed
to
be
an
ipa
if
i
try
this
again
i
will
re
rate
off
the
tap
at
rira
in
burlington
this
beer
was
a
very
cloudymurky
copperamber
color
the
one
finger
yellowishbeige
head
displayed
very
good
retention
and
very
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
citrus
hops
some
fruity
esters
and
a
little
yeast
the
flavors
were
quite
hoppy
at
first
with
solid
citrus
definition
before
it
went
into
pale
malt
vanilla
and
wood
the
finish
was
very
green
with
a
lot
of
herbal
full
leaf
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
smooth
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
medium
a
solid
vermont
offering
i
would
skip
this
one
if
served
in
a
bottle
but
ill
certainly
give
it
a
try
on
tap
this
one
would
greatly
benificiate
a
second
try
from
a
cask
this
time
expect
a
second
review
in
the
future
the
feel
is
milky
but
with
a
fizzy
bite
like
a
thick
belgian
ale
a
sipper
could
use
a
bit
more
liquidity
overall
its
funky
like
a
belgian
ale
moreso
really
than
it
is
an
ipa
good
but
misleading
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
its
appearance
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
not
one
id
seek
out
again
bottom
line
this
is
an
interesting
and
tasty
and
very
bitter
example
of
an
ipa
its
my
first
brew
from
this
brewery
and
i
like
what
theyve
done
here
ive
gotta
try
more
east
coast
ipas
i
went
looking
for
the
esb
at
the
booth
and
they
did
not
have
so
i
went
with
the
next
best
thing
i
thought
i
was
horribly
mistaken
well
done
guys
keep
it
up
i
wouldnt
change
a
thing
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
medium
lasting
beige
head
smell
is
mostly
hops
and
somewhat
dry
taste
is
dry
and
hoppy
with
a
light
malt
influence
and
moderate
refreshing
bitterness
clean
refreshing
woodsy
lightly
piney
flavor
medium
body
and
carbonation
nice
overall
mouthfeel
is
excellent
smooth
from
start
to
finish
with
a
bit
of
bite
on
the
side
of
the
tongue
yum
very
interesting
if
you
love
cask
you
might
dig
this
one
but
its
hardly
an
ipa
to
me
an
odd
tasting
english
ipa
the
flavors
never
quite
come
together
citrus
solvency
burnt
floral
hops
tea
etc
one
ill
pass
on
in
the
future
overall
a
tasty
eipa
good
drinkability
definitely
tastes
like
an
english
version
of
the
ipa
malty
bready
and
not
too
much
hop
bitterness
i
like
it
on
cask
at
the
establishment
last
wed
nightpoured
from
the
cask
a
lighter
amber
with
a
thin
but
well
sustained
headenglish
hop
aromas
somewhat
leafy
and
floral
with
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
intertwined
pretty
balanced
ipa
again
the
hop
presence
if
leafy
with
a
bit
of
citrus
a
firm
sweeter
malt
base
holds
up
to
the
hops
through
to
the
finish
not
bad
it
wont
bowl
you
over
with
hops
but
its
not
bad
i
love
a
welldone
cask
ale
and
this
is
one
had
two
years
later
and
just
as
good
or
better
more
sutable
carbonation
originally
reviewed

22
oz
bottle
aroma
is
a
light
misty
dry
hop
as
of
a
barleywine
profile
profusive
tanned
fruits
delicate
pour
of
heavily
clouded
rich
amber
sienna
fogged
with
orange
bursts
of
yeasts
and
hints
of
caramel
bold
tawny
bowling
over
foamy
head
flavor
is
a
magnificient
run
of
malts
and
gentle
fruit
hops
its
like
a
wateredown
barleywine
but
not
in
a
bad
way
flavor
is
an
amalgamation
of
rich
spice
fruit
some
bold
yeast
character
and
an
astringent
east
meets
west
battle
of
the
hops
delectable
and
soothing
some
very
light
distant
aged
qualites
dancing
with
sherried
persimmon
and
oxidized
grain
this
lends
maturity
and
sophisitication
the
malt
is
excellently
constructed
in
this
beer
and
thats
what
really
shines
it
also
beams
of
balance
which
i
heavily
appreciate
smack
is
heavy
of
hearty
hops
resins
and
fleeting
pipe
tobacco
i
can
see
why
traditional
american
ipa
lovers
wouldnt
like
its
not
the
typical
clean
sweet
west
coast
hop
heavy
animal
that
so
many
are
but
this
is
different
better
and
far
above
with
more
character
than
any
other
ipa
can
usually
muster
pours
a
cloudy
orangeamber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
fades
away
quickly
smells
mainly
of
citrus
and
grapefruit
aromas
and
a
stiff
maltiness
in
there
as
well
taste
is
of
aspirinlike
astringent
hops
and
some
sweet
malts
kind
of
weak
though
im
guessing
this
beer
is
kind
of
old
as
well
it
seems
almost
flat
very
little
carbonation
and
pretty
thick
mouthfeel
the
flavor
ends
very
sharp
with
bitterness
but
doesnt
stick
around
for
too
long
alcohol
is
fairly
detectable
as
well
in
the
taste
very
balanced
anyways
not
bad
not
great
either
but
like
i
said
this
beer
is
definitely
old
overall
i
have
a
tough
time
getting
fresh
bottles
from
mcneills
it
doesnt
help
that
i
sat
on
it
for
a
year
but
stuff
happens
well
its
either
that
or
thats
just
the
way
that
they
are
supposed
to
taste
drinkability
this
was
a
bit
heavier
than
expected
and
was
more
meallike
than
refreshing
not
bad
kind
of
unique
but
not
overwhelming
pours
an
orangish
red
color
with
almost
no
head
at
all
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
and
pleasant
slight
grapefruit
smell
with
the
malts
definitely
present
the
taste
is
very
malty
and
sweet
where
are
all
the
hops
it
has
a
very
silky
and
creamy
mouthfeel
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
due
to
the
low
carbonation
decent
tasting
brew
but
an
ipa
this
is
not
even
by
english
ipa
standards
as
my
previous
review
of
a
mcneills
bottle
productis
there
is
a
lot
of
inconsistency
with
them
but
i
can
resist
buying
them
because
when
you
get
a
good
one
you
get
a
good
one
m
d
mouthfeel
isnt
very
good
on
this
one
not
hoppy
at
all
with
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
not
very
carbonated
at
allpossibly
this
was
a
bad
one
would
like
to
try
it
again
on
tap
drinkability
on
this
is
not
very
high
picked
up
a
bomber
in
montpelier
with
a
drink
before
date
of
the
end
of
december
i
think
the
notch
didnt
line
up
perfectly
pours
an
orangey
brown
with
a
fluffy
offwhitetan
head
nice
lacing
on
my
glass
aroma
is
very
subdued
some
tangy
malt
flavors
with
some
floral
notes
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
at
all
taste
is
toasty
and
nutty
with
the
hops
making
more
of
an
appearance
and
nice
spicy
dry
bitter
finish
medium
carbonation
medium
bodied
and
extremely
drinkable
decent
example
of
an
englishstyle
ipa
drinkability
oh
yeah
utterly
unimpressed
expected
much
more
usually
like
mcneills
brews
been
to
the
brewpub
and
walked
out
happy
got
a
hunch
this
would
be
really
good
on
cask
poured
absolutely
flat
cloudy
orangey
brown
no
head
and
i
really
really
tried
nose
is
slihgtly
sweet
with
a
quick
bitter
pinch
from
the
hops
flavor
is
very
malty
even
for
an
english
ipa
hos
are
there
but
pressed
underneath
all
the
malts
getting
some
overripe
grapefruits
and
some
other
rotten
fruits
mouthfeel
is
very
and
wants
to
be
chewy
but
falls
short
would
work
well
in
a
pinch
probably
but
this
is
not
a
pinch
i
wonder
if
this
was
a
spoiled
bottle
and
if
the
real
stuff
on
tap
is
what
is
giving
it
high
ratings
from
bas
all
four
of
us
agreed
that
this
was
the
worst
ipa
of
the
12
new
england
and
midatlantic
bottled
beers
in
our
blind
taste
test
bomber
bottle
with
freshness
indicator
notched
onto
the
label
pours
into
my
leffe
challis
with
a
rich
almond
amber
tone
murky
and
cloudy
fine
bubble
film
develops
after
the
slim
off
white
head
dissipates
this
one
leaves
alot
of
nicely
striated
and
well
dispersed
lacing
nose
is
mildly
of
soft
hops
and
yeasty
dough
hoppy
brew
but
not
overly
bitter
or
harsh
on
the
flavor
receptors
english
style
all
the
way
the
bottle
i
sampled
was
fairly
fresh
the
hops
were
well
represented
and
flavorful
malt
is
the
also
nicely
in
evidence
the
result
is
a
balanced
flavorful
brew
quite
dry
in
the
finish
nice
eipa
get
a
fresh
bottle
and
enjoy
it
drinkability
the
worst
ipa
i
have
had
by
far
this
one
took
the
drain
pretty
quickly
although
its
an
english
ipa
so
naaaa
this
is
just
bad
no
matter
what
style
though
i
thank
spinlock
for
the
effort
in
getting
me
a
new
beer
to
try
i
just
hope
he
didnt
get
one
for
himself
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
beige
head
over
a
smoewhat
murky
orangey
amber
brew
head
uneven
similar
to
a
cask
ale
kind
of
light
and
bigbubbled
yet
shortlived
fading
to
a
small
layer
of
bubbles
and
laces
average
to
well
fruity
aroma
coupled
with
ample
malt
character
flavor
is
a
letdown
for
me
bitterness
dominates
upfront
not
necessarily
in
a
good
way
which
fades
to
a
tart
almost
sour
earthy
malt
taste
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
lacking
in
part
due
to
extremely
low
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
about
the
same
this
one
just
didnt
hit
it
off
for
me
will
have
to
revisit
and
doublecheck
that
my
observations
were
valid
reflection
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
like
my
ipas
loaded
with
hop
flavor
this
one
was
lacking
in
that
area
had
this
in
a
22oz
bottle
with
nice
art
of
a
dead
horse
on
the
label
this
poured
out
murky
amber
with
hardly
a
scattering
of
bubbles
on
top
no
lacing
of
any
kind
smell
is
a
bit
of
earthiness
mainly
dirt
this
smells
like
some
on
took
half
a
cup
of
beer
added
half
a
cup
of
dirt
and
served
well
the
taste
follows
suite
with
a
funky
dirt
taste
with
a
slight
dirty
bitter
after
taste
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
more
carbonation
that
i
expected
due
to
no
head
showing
up
while
not
being
particularly
nasty
this
tasted
like
crap
and
is
something
i
may
have
in
the
future
since
its
possible
i
got
a
bad
bottle
it
was
still
before
the
best
by
date
but
oh
well
thanks
to
ppoitras
for
the
brew
22oz

to
the
whole
concoction
previously
i
lived
under
the
impression
that
i
loved
all
things
mcneills
but
after
this
one
the
spell
was
broken

caught
off
guard
by
the
astringent
notes
addictive
scotch
tape
mmmm
office
supplies
quality
of
a
good
john
courage
or
double
diamond
on
draft
the
awesome
balance
and
compelling
tealike
taste
of
fullers
esb
all
in
all
it
just
tastes
like
itself
with
the
scale
tipped
a
bit
towards
bitterness
this
is
one
of
the
most
unique
and
drinkable
beers
out
there
but
beware
i
have
had
more
than
one
bad
tap
experience
it
can
vary
greatly
in
in
flavor
and
quality
like
many
beauties
maybe
it
doesnt
age
well
ive
sent
a
few
back
convinced
i
had
the
wrong
beer
but
last
sat
at
redbones
i
knew
it
was
the
right
one
but
i
kept
on
needing
more
proof
the
first
few
sips
has
a
nice
sharp
hop
bitterness
but
as
the
pint
goes
down
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
starts
to
shine
through
i
really
liked
this
brew
at
the
pub
and
the
bottled
version
didnt
disappoint
either
i
really
enjoy
this
beers
aroma
especially
when
im
taking
a
sip
the
taste
is
fine
worthy
of
more
than
one
taste
tiny
tickle
from
hops
at
front
rides
through
the
back
of
the
throat
before
disappearing
lightbodied
minor
mouthfeel
at
first
this
was
a
dud
at
first
glance
but
after
a
couple
sips
it
perked
up
and
the
hoppiness
became
more
prominent
on
the
palate
juicy
and
fruity
zings
on
the
buds
and
plays
nicely
in
the
mouth
still
lacks
the
bold
bite
im
looking
for
but
pleasing
enough
drinkability
its
a
tasty
brew
but
with
the
minimal
carbonation
this
beer
suffers
a
bit
in
drinkability
think
i
got
a
fresh
bottle
because
this
beer
was
kicking
with
flavor
an
americanized
version
of
a
british
ipa
it
fits
neatly
into
neither
of
these
polarized
categories
like
its
many
bubbles
this
brew
is
kickin
another
good
offering
from
mcneills
nice
copper
cloudy
appearance
with
minimal
head
but
some
lacing
earthy
and
floral
hops
notes
that
are
very
nice
taste
had
a
citus
hint
and
the
finish
kicked
in
a
very
nice
hop
bite
mouthfeel
was
rounded
and
finish
was
dry
drinkability
was
very
good
considering
the
hop
bite
if
you
like
a
nice
hoppy
finish
this
is
worth
a
try
served
through
a

thanks
to
mickeys01
for
the
samples
this
is
a
first
class
ipa
and
one
i
will
be
certain
to
pick
up
again
id
love
to
try
it
right
from
the
cask
22oz
bomber
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
orange
color
with
one
finger
of
head
there
is
a
bit
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
fairly
fruity
with
a
little
citrus
and
a
lot
of
white
grapes
which
is
odd
for
an
ipa
only
a
little
bit
of
hops
present
but
nevertheless
a
good
smell
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
and
malty
at
first
but
the
hops
really
come
through
in
the
middle
and
finish
a
bit
of
fruity
esters
in
there
as
well
the
taste
could
be
a
little
bit
more
bold
though
it
seems
a
tad
weak
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
heavy
but
still
smooth
on
the
tongue
the
drinkability
is
fairly
good
as
well
just
a
moderate
amount
of
alcohol
not
a
bad
session
ipa
f
cloudy
amberorange
color
with
a
decent
head
and
a
little
lacing
there
was
not
much
of
a
hoppy
nose
on
this
ipa
but
di
detect
some
malty
and
bready
notes
nice
thick
and
smooth
mouthfeel
with
lite
carbonation
of
tiny
bubbles
hop
flavors
were
real
nice
with
a
somewhat
mellowover
all
but
left
you
with
a
strong
presence
in
the
after
taste
really
nice
bite
to
the
hops

nice

rind

some

colored
ale
with
a
large
head
full
of
big
bubbles
also
i
am
not
sure
is
this
is
a
bottle
conditioned
ale
but
there
is
certianly
a
fair
amount
of
debris
floating
around
a
nice
light
sweet
floral
scent
to
the
beer
initially
light
in
the
mouth
but
with
a
strong
bitter
after
taste
i
generally
like
hoppy
beers
but
this
didnt
suit
my
taste
amber
honey
color
with
some
reddish
hues
coming
through
white
foamy
bubbles
sit
atop
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
head
spotty
lacing
down
the
glass
aroma
is
of
malt
and
hops
somewhat
sweet
a
little
fruity
mouthfeel
is
watery
with
low
carbonation
taste
is
an
even
mix
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
bitter
finish
like
biting
into
an
orange
peel
a
bit
of
smoke
comes
through
as
well
lingering
pine
and
citrus
sticks
in
the
back
of
the
throat
not
my
favorite
from
this
brewer
it
doesnt
stand
up
to
some
of
the
other
ipas
out
there
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
drinkable
oh
dont
get
me
started
this
is
really
a
beautiful
brew
well
rounded
and
oh
so
tasty
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
hops
and
malt
not
overly
powerful
but
lets
you
know
its
going
to
be
a
nice
thirst
quenching
ipa
taste
is
very
full
nice
hop
bitterness
with
plenty
of
english
malt
flavor
and
soem
fruit
esters
mixing
nicely
i
taste
a
little
bit
of
apple
very
smooth
and
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
not
as
dry
as
some
ipas
in
the
finish
yummy
reminiscent
of
a
british
ipa
with
an
american
twist
bit
of
a
one
note
beer
i
thought
it
could
use
a
bit
more
balance
and
have
some
malt
characteristics
mcneills
is
probably
my
favorite
new
england
brewery
however
and
i
will
always
come
back
to
this
brew
pat
umm
lots
of
yeasty
goodness
floating
about
this
cloudy
copper
ipa
holds
a
nice
offwhite
head
and
trails
of
sticky
lace
the
aroma
is
of
fresh
hops
malt
yeast
and
alcohol
medium
malty
and
highly
hopped
with
a
strong
grapefruit
bitterness
and
mild
citrus
and
metallic
tanginess
the
edginess
mellows
out
towards
the
end
of
the
22oz
bottle
if
it
was
easier
to
find
id
be
drinking
this
on
those
hot
summer
days
pours
a
hazy
orangey
brown
small
tan
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
on
the
way
down
aroma
is
lightly
malt
sweet
with
some
floral
pine
and
citrus
hints
from
the
hops
flavor
is
initially
sweet
from
the
malts
then
gets
some
good
earthy
pineapple
and
grapefruit
from
the
hops
body
is
quite
full
seems
very
close
to
a
cask
conditioned
beer
going
down
drinkability
this
is
a
well
done
englishstyle
ipa
its
not
in
the
same
league
as
the
best
ipas
out
there
but
its
quite
drinkable
and
would
match
well
with
a
variety
of
food
a
very
hazy
brown
with
a
small
head
quite
fruity
and
a
bit
yeasty
the
hops
fit
into
the
balance
so
wonderfully
well
very
interesting
ipa
not
supped
up
like
most
american
ipas
these
days
mellow
and
very
pleasant
certainly
worth
your
mouths
time
pours
a
nice
orange
color
with
a
decent
head
hops
hops
and
more
hops
they
blast
your
senses
from
the
opening
sip
to
the
last
keptchap
whacked
drop
from

the
hops
were
not
overwhelming
but
rather
delightful

beer

and
bold

no

with
copious
quantities

aroma
some
oily
hops
as
well
flavors
are
pretty

balanced
and
the
hops
are
fairly
tame
considering
this
is
a
mcneills
brew
and
an
ipa
never
fear
though
as
the
hops
are
the
dominate
player
smooth

and
relatively

some

is

good
ipa
but
not
quite
what
i
expected
the
beer
as
it
sets
in
my
glass
a
limpid
copper
color
the
head
is
immature
and
the
lace
satisfactorily
covers
the
glass
lots
of
malt
at
the
front
lightly
floral
somewhat
sweet
but
all
in

a

beer
top
a

slender

for

i
liked
this
one
i
got
mine
at
jungle
jims
near
cincinnati
it
came
in
a
bottled
4
pack
none
on
tap
anywhere
in
the
area
i
could
find
it
has
a
clear
bright
golden
to
orange
color
no
haze
at
all
the
aroma
was
very
hoppy
and
pleasant
to
me
though
it
has
that
strong
green
oniongrassy
smell
that
some
european
beers
have
sorry
that
is
the
only
way
i
can
think
to
describe
it
to
it
that
some
might
call
skunky
which
surprised
me
i
repeat
i
found
it
pleasant
and
pretty
complex
you
can
also
discover
the
woody
notes
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
lighter
than
i
expected
the
head
was
a
bright
white
that
started
strong
and
dropped
away
after
a
minute
or
so
to
a
thin
lacing
it
was
not
as
hoppy
on
the
tongue
as
most
ipas
i
will
buy
again
not
one

favorites

choices
there

i
agree
with

exactly
very
drinkable
strong
notes
of
buttery
caramel
with
secondary
notes
of
a
golden
rum
and
a
light
oak
not
for
hop
heads
but
refreshing
for
its
style
being
a
hop
head
of
some
degree
ipa
is
a
bit
of
a
misnomer
on
this
beer
even
the
more
reserved
british
style
ipa
doesnt
accurately
reflect
this
beer
its
very
soft
on
the
palate
strong
notes
of
buttery
caramel
with
secondary
notes
of
a
golden
rum
and
light

it
slides

reminds

this

75innis
and
gunn
is
a
great
brewery
that
i
constantly
come
back
to
this
one
is
new
to
ct
so
i
thought
i
would
try
it
i
was
happy
to
see
that
they
are
using
colored
bottles
instead
of
clear
glass
which
doesnt
eliminate
any
sunlight
the
appearance
was
a
nice
dark
yellow
with
a
lot
of
wood
on
the
nose
the
taste
was
a
bit
shocking
to
be
honest
there
was
little
to
no
hops
in
it
and
was
mostly
the
toasty
flavor
of
the
oak
but
the
flavor
was
really
good
on
the
end
of
the
taste
you
get
a
bit
of
a
floral
bite
that
gives
a
nice
finish
i
loved
it
also
i
liked
the
moutfeel
as
well
as
it
was
medium
thick
which
complemented
the
mellow
flavor
i
would
highly
recommend

overy
drinkable
craft
brew
reminds
me
of
my
early
days
home
brewing
ive
tried
to
love
this
beer
for
many
years
just
because
it
was
one
of
my
first
local
beers
i
had
the
cask
conditioned
version
last
night
at
clarks
ale
house
and
my
mind
hasnt
changed
this
is
just
a
run
of
the
mill
ipa
the
late
knight
dipa
is
amazing
and
i
wish
they
would
change
the
recipe
and
kick
this
single
ipa
up
a
bit
there
are
so
many
good
ipas
available
in
the
cny
area
now
and
its
hard
to
pick
this
on
a
menu
o
matches
the
style
very
well
o
this
brew
is
brewed
just
over
a
half
an
hour
away
from
my
house
and
am
glad
it
is
this
is
a
very
solid
example
of
an
english
ipa
and
has
found
its
way
to
being
one
of
the
regulars
in
my
fridge
pairs
really
good
with
some
cajun
shrimp
too
od
a
fairly
drinkable
ipa
the
english
element
is
hard
to
discern
though
a
solid
hop
flavour
that
wasnt
overpowering
but
held
its
own
overy
solid
beer
have
only
have
had
it
a
few
times
and
seem
to
forget
how
great
it
is
o
i
know
this
rating
is
going
to
be
well
above
average
but
i
was
super
impressed
this
could
easily
be
an
everyday
ipa
on
par
with
jai
alai
despite
being
labeled
an
english
ipa
this
is
a
very
sweet
only
slightly
dry
ale
overall
a
perfect
balance
of
hops
to
english
malts
worthy
of
the
price
overall
excellent
session
brew
given
to
me
by
a
local
homebrew
buddy
steve
thanks
man
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
want
a
break
from
the
standard
american
ipa
omaybe
this
bottle
was
just
old
but
serves
them
right
for
not
putting
a
date
on
the
bottle
if
i
could
get
a
fresh
bottle
id
try
it
again
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
depth
of
flavoring
it
really
followed
the
nose
nicely
and
was
equally
as
soft
and
sweet
but
once
the
liquid
dropped
off
you
got
a
more
intense
rumble
of
bittering
phenols
wood
and
piney
bite
this
is
surprising
when
it
happens
but
it
strikes
a
pleasant
balance
to
the
front
of
the
flavoring
which
is
relatively
sweet
the
feel
was
a
bit
light
but
not
so
noticeable
as
to
wreck
your
experience
an
amazing
offering
despite
the
dorky
label
you
want
citrus
in
your
ipa
were
talking
pink
grapefruit
fresh
perfect
citrus
combined
with
all
the
bitterness
you
want
in
a
well
balanced
ipa
i
had
this
stocked
in
my
kegerator
for
two
years
after
i
first
moved
back
to
syracuse
the
bottles
report
well
but
a
fresh
draft
hard
to
find
tastes
like
a
miracle
considering
its
humble
roots
really
good
tasty
ipa
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
balance
of
strong
hops
and
dry
malts
would
have
this
again

id
say
this
is

that
uses

is

pretty

the

still
taste

worth
a

you
overall
this
is

and
showcases
a

of
what
makes
them

a

but
it
just
doesnt

my

the
way
some
of

do

big
body
makes
this
one
a
bit
filling
for
a
session
beer
and
it
is
definitely
a
cold
weather
ipa
not
magining
this
to
be
a
summer
drink
enjoyed
this
syracuse
staple
overall
overall
a
good
beer
but
i
think
its
more
of
a
pale
ale
than
a
ipa
however
this
was
the
first
english
ipa
i
had
so
maybe
thats
just
the
style
o
fairly
enjoyable
beer
i
liked
it
more
when
i
realized
it
was
an
english
ipa
and
not
the
american
one
i
was
expecting
solid
stuff
o
good
ipa
not
overly
hopped
really
hits
the
spot
decent
drinkability
but
the
hops
are
a
bit
onedimensional
would
like
a
little
more
complexity
rather
than
just
bitterness
english
maltiness
and
american
hoppiness
always
work
out
well
together
if
for
a
slightly
better
attenuation
and
less
buttery
notes
this
could
be
an
absolutely
irresistable
beer
a
good
ipa
if
not
an
interesting
one
closer
to
a
pilsner
in
feel
and
taste
still
the
little
diacetyl
adds
something
if
not
a
little
strange
the
pour
brings
an
orangecopper
brew
with
a
good
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
forward
some
slightlyearthy
and
floral
hops
along
with
a
slight
touch
of
diacetyl
though
here
it
works
well
body
has
some
semisweet
bread
and
caramel
plus
light
toffee
some
hop
flavor
though
that
comes
in
more
toward
the
finish
which
has
a
pleasing
dry
bitterness
good
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
and
the
yeast
threw
off
a
bit
of
diacetyl
that
was
allowed
to
remain
but
it
fits
well
with
the
style
another
solid
effort
i
really
enjoyed
all
of
the
beers
i
had
from
them
clear
and
golden
with
low
head
retention
aroma
is
caramel
and
earthy
moderate
carbonation
and
an
earthy
bitter
middle
and
finish
nice
balance
in
the
middle
not
too
dry
not
too
sweet
medium
to
heavy
body
a
nice
alternative
to
the
west
coast
ipas
do
overall
i
drank
this
because
i
like
beer
and
i
dont
waste
if
i
had
a
choice
this
would
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
notes
this
beer
teeter
totters
from
sweet
malt
to
full
on
hop
bitterness
well
done
picked
this
bottle
up
randomly
at
premier
gourmet
pours
an
amberorange
colour
with
thick
white
head
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
and
nice
head
retention
smells
of
earthy
hops
with
minerals
and
metal
not
too
bitter
in
the
flavour
some
mild
sweetness
the
metallic
flavour
seems
to
linger
in
the
aftertaste
im
not
a
fan
of
this
the
reveal
middle
ages
im
paled
ale
an
india
pale
ale
maybe
its
all
the
massive
hop
bombs
ive
been
drinking
lately
but
i
wouldnt
put
this
in
the
ipa
park
that
being
said
it
tastes
like
a
really
hoppy
english
bitter
which
im
digging
on
so
beer
wise
i
like
it
id
just
pigeon
hole
it
in
a
different
category
thanks
sliverx
for
the
opportunity
maybe
its
a
bad
bottle
pours
a
pretty
orange
with
a
good
amount
of
head
good
lacing
looks
pretty
solid
smells
wrong
not
much
hops
on
the
nose
tastes
old
stale
and
not
very
hoppy
directly
from
the
brewery
a
few
weeks
ago
so
if
its
just
that
its
old
that
is
100
the
breweries
fault
very
disappointed
in
this
one
overall
there
is
a
slight
sourness
but
mostly
this
is
a
well
crafted
and
balanced
traditional
ipa
d
impaled
is
a
stellar
ipa
the
crafting
of
this
brew
makes
it
so
more
unique
than
many
other
ipas
out
there
highly
recommended
d
meh
not
a
drain
pour
but
nothing
special
i
dont
mind
drinking
this
one
but
couldnt
see
myself
spending
money
for
this
i
am
very
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
it
though
drink
ive
been
drinking
a
lot
of
ipas
lately
and
this
one
doesnt
really
stand
out
but
its
still
highly
drinkable
and
would
be
a
good
session
beer
its
a
great
beer
for
fans
of
malty
ipas
rather
than
hoppy
ones
taste
is
just
meh
not
off
putting
at
all
but
not
all
that
great
either
hoppy
bitterness
bit
of
apple
maybe
from
the
yeast
bready
malts
and
a
champagne
like
slight
fruitiness
the
balance
is
there
but
the
hops
lack
any
sort
of
depth
that
is
crucial
in
any
ipa
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
but
overall
mouthfeel
is
decent
nothing
about
the
actual
flavors
hurt
the
drinkability
i
would
just
prefer
to
reach
for
a
tastier
offering
im
actually
impressed
by
it
i
could
drink
several
for
sure
its
an
ipa
that
might
entice
even
the
nonipa
drinker
i
prefer
a
really
hoppy
ipa
and
this
isnt
it
but
this
is
definitely
a
great
beer
worth
checking
out
maybe
this
is
an
older
bottle
based
on
the
consensus
reviews
but
i
can
only
go
on
what
ive
got
here
moderate
pour
gives
a
sticky
cake
of
offwhite
head
a
modest
12
thick
but
with
great
retention
that
eventually
settles
into
craters
looks
like
a
big
golf
ball
brew
itself
is
a
thin
clear
copper
color
smell
is
a
blend
of
mildly
sweet
light
malt
diacetyl
then
mixed
hop
coming
in
third
taste
is
much
hoppier
than
the
nose
implied
a
bitter
inky
generic
hop
takes
control
malt
backbone
gives
it
a
moderate
body
provides
good
support
but
as
far
as
taste
it
takes
a
back
seat
to
the
hop
a
little
candi
sugar
and
even
less
diacetyl
are
present
the
carbonation
is
a
little
heavy
harsh
but
not
quite
offensive
it
keeps
the
finish
clean
good
beer
true
to
the
english
style
if
your
looking
for
tons
of
hops
this
is
not
your
beer
good
brew
follows
the
style
nicely
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
tasty
and
in
its
own
way
unique
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
i
wont
deliberately
trade
for
it
again
but
would
pick
some
up
if
it
made
its
way
to
store
down
here
the
body
was
nice
not
overly
light
or
heavy
drinkability
was
good
before
my
move
to
the
northwest
this
was
a
regular
for
me
overall
a
decent
example
of
the
style
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
notes
well
this
one
is
certainly
not
too
shaby
a
very
tasty
english
i
p
a
cheers
lotsa
winter
sun
shining
through
this
bottle
seems
a
clear
brew
but
poured
into
a
pint
glass
just
a
slight
haze
shows
in
copper
srm
14
on
my
beer
color
chart
here
very
teeny
tiny
bubbles
rise
all
the
time
more
discrete
than
good
champagne
excellent
head
shrinks
slowly
leaving
sticky
lace
on
glass
and
persistent
foam
on
surface
smells
yeasty
to
me
slightly
greenish
hop
blossomy
dont
smell
malt
tastes
just
great
excellent
simple
solidblock
bitter
with
hints
of
yeast
and
caramel
only
a
beer
pretzel
and
goat
cheese
nearby
could
possibly
improve
this
delish
mouthwatering
happyhoppiness
i
also
enjoy
ipas
with
more
various
multinoted
hop
flavor
but
this
huge
juicy
simple
unified
hop
taste
is
great
too
mouthfeel
could
be
too
carbonated
if
you
dont
pour
big
head
so
let
it
splash
high
from
your
bottle
pour
long
lingering
oily
hop
aftertaste
just
what
hopheads
live
for
ill
admit
im
biased
toward
local
beers
grew
up
in
syracuse
live
in
ithaca
now
so
this
counts
as
locavore
politically
correct
ale
for
me
and
i
try
to
keep
impaled
ale
in
fridge
at
all
times
only
2
left
time
for
another
fresh
6pack
d
somewhat
tasty
goes
down
alright
floral
notes
are
bit
too
pungent
in
my
opinion
i
could
have
one
or
two
of
these
but
more
than
that
would
be
too
much
this
tasty
and
insanely
drinkable
ipa
perfectly
captures
the
english
spirit
of
the
7
or
8
middle
ages
brews
ive
tried
this
is
definitely
the
crown
jewel
the
bitterness
factor
is
pretty
high
here
and
the
malt
delivers
balance
but
not
enough
to
cut
through
the
green
stuff
which
is
pretty
righton
the
pour
delivers
a
nice
foamy
2
finger
head
with
a
beautiful
coppery
color
it
has
a
sweet
smell
almost
fruity
but
you
definitely
smell
the
hops
from
the
first
sip
there
is
a
hint
of
citrus
but
finishes
with
hops
not
an
overbearing
hoppy
taste
but
just
enough
i
will
say
it
is
smooth
on
the
tongue
and
in
the
mouth
definitely
a
medium
bodied
well
balanced
ipa
i
would
classify
this
as
a
middle
of
the
road
ipa
which
is
good
and
enables
you
to
drink
several
in
a
night
glasses
that
is
not
growlers
overall
bitter
goodness
that
dares
you
to
stop
drinking
it
middle
ages
impaled
ale
is
a
slightly
cloudy
light
amber
ale
with
a
dense
lumpy
splotchy
offwhite
head
that
has
excellent
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
juicy
spicy
slightly
sweet
aroma
it
almost
smells
like
honey
its
medium
bodied
and
maybe
a
touch
watery
but
its
smooth
and
the
finish
is
dry
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
between
sweet
and
dry
its
grainy
and
bready
fruity
and
citrusy
with
a
sweet
spicy
aftertaste
its
easy
drinking
overall
definitely
an
ipa
to
be
excited
about
if
you
see
it
be
sure
to
try
it
nice
beer
and
wishing
i
had
another
medium
bodied
carbonated
nicely
a
fair
drinker
taste
is
a
nice
combination
of
malt
sweetness
the
buttery
yeastines
and
citrus
definitely
more
of
the
englishstyle
than
the
west
coast
style
ipa
its
nicely
balanced
and
slightly
astringent
from
the
hops
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
with
a
good
amount
of
hop
flavor
coming
out
thanks
to
brothercannon
for
tossing
me
a
bottle
of
this
from
his
variety
pack
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
the
ale
appears
a
clear
pale
straw
color
with
about
an
inch
of
bone
white
foam
nose
and
flavor
are
of
citrus
fruits
such
as
oranges
lemons
fruity
grassy
hops
lightly
toasted
grains
and
sweet
malt
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
around
pours
a
very
nice
golden
yelloworange
color
nice
carbonation
nice
twofinger
offwhite
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
very
slight
hop
note
slight
citrus
fruity
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
some
hop
notes
but
not
much
slight
citrus
with
some
fruit
notes
medium
body
drinkable
a
nice
little
brew
i
enjoy
drinking
this
since
the
mouthfeel
makes
it
feel
like
a
fresh
authentic
brew
but
its
not
without
its
flaws
beautiful
pour
from
the
cask
nice
foamy
head
with
some
fine
lacing
that
lasts
aroma
was
the
best
quality
perfect
for
an
ipa
floral
spice
fruit
hoppy
i
could
just
stand
there
and
smell
this
all
day
taste
was
just
like
the
nose
with
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
coming
through
in
the
finish
lingers
on
the
palate
very
good
medthick
body
most
notable
of
this
ipa
other
than
the
pleasant
flowery
aroma
is
the
smoothness
meaning
it
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
with
hops
and
is
very
drinkable
flair
gets
a
rare
pinfall
win
in
dallas
wellbalanced
but
style
hoppy
enough
to
fit
an
englishstyle
ipa
nice
english
character
with
an
american
cascade
hop
touch
in
the
finish
very
easy
to
drink
d
this
is
a
great
ipa
i
was
hooked
after
the
first
sip
thats
all
i
can
say
drinkability
not
the
greatest
beer
ive
ever
had
too
much
diacetyl
makes
for
not
such
a
good
brew
you
suck
adam
special
thanks
to
littlebreeze
for
this
one
the
beer
is
quite
medium
bodied
decently
carbonated
with
a
grapefruit
like
tangy
hop
presence
and
some
tart
and
acerbic
tastes
lingering
throughout
the
beer
is
quite
sweet
with
florals
oily
and
estery
hops
quite
noticeable
and
a
slightly
bittering
hop
presence
in
the
finish
this
is
a
good
eipa
but
it
is
missing
the
bisquity
malts
the
more
traditional
leafy
and
bittering
hops
the
citrus
and
grapefruity
tartness
just
predominates
too
much
for
this
to
be
a
traditional
interpretation
of
the
style
this
is
more
of
a
nouvelle
ipa
in
all
of
its
citrusy
hop
zest
the
6
5
abv
is
somewhat
noticeable
with
a
slightly
syrupy
and
oily
mouthfeel
and
a
touch
of
a
throaty
burn
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
worth
seeking
out
the
mouth
is
smooth
with
pleasant
oiliness
but
thins
in
the
end
easy
enough
drinker
but
the
sourness
limits
me
to
2
or
3
d
a
nicely
balanced
ipa
and
one
that
i
will
certainly
look
forward
to
picking
up
again
when
in
the
area
not
out
the
roof
with
alcohol
and
nice
and
smooth
drinking
drinkability
would
definatly
have
a
few
more
of
these
taste
is
good
looks
great
and
even
though
the
flavor
doesnt
go
above
and
beyond
i
would
definately
seek
this
out
again
it
was
a
pretty
good
ipa
sometimes
it
got
a
little
too
citrusy
for
me
but
i
did
like
the
level
of
bitterness
this
ipa
contained
since
its
an
affordable
beer
i
could
see
this
as
a
session
ipa
this
beer
poured
a
goldenorange
color
with
a
thick
retentive
head
tight
bubbles
the
hop
aroma
is
present
initially
but
then
it
fades
quickly
to
a
sweet
malty
smell
the
taste
is
bitter
in
the
beginning
yielding
to
a
sweet
malt
flavor
this
finish
is
bitter
it
is
kind
of
an
interesting
roller
coaster
effect
with
the
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
bodied
and
quite
carbonated
this
is
a
well
rounded
beer
that
definitely
deserves
a
try
dont
think
i
need
to
have
another
dpretty
good
eipa
fairly
drinkable
but
nothing
spectacular
it
doesnt
help
that
i
had
a
belhaven
twisted
thistle
beforehand
still
this
is
a
well
made
brew
i
could
take
this
or
leave
it
its
just
so
dry
and
so
bitter
on
the
finish
the
hop
flavor
isnt
all
that
interesting
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
2
fingers
of
frothy
offwhite
head
and
good
retention
and
lacing
smells
of
floral
hops
a
touch
of
pine
and
citrus
honey
bread
and
butter
tastes
of
lemon
apricot
and
tangerine
up
front
are
quickly
overpowered
by
a
caramel
and
bread
backbone
the
backbone
lasts
a
good
while
before
any
signs
of
ipa
resurface
with
a
hint
of
peppery
and
floral
hops
and
notes
of
butter
to
finish
out
the
flavors
medium
in
body
with
great
carbonation
some
hop
presence
but
mainly
malty
with
most
of
the
bitterness
seeming
to
not
come
from
the
hops
not
really
my
kind
of
ipa
the
carbonation
seems
to
be
at
the
perfect
level
and
offers
some
saving
grace
for
the
mouthfeel
but
there
is
a
somewhat
thin
finish
fair
drinkability
aided
by
the
fact
that
it
isnt
a
hop
bomb
attempting
to
overwhelm
but
offers
a
firm
hop
presence
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
blurs
the
boundary
between
the
english
and
american
ipa
styles
its
a
good
flavorful
beer
with
some
substance
that
is
worth
drinking
a
few
of
d
very
drinkable
with
a
great
aftertaste
this
one
is
definitely
something
i
could
have
a
couple
or
more
of
in
a
sitting
too
bad
it
isnt
available
in
my
area
definitely
recommended
d
not
bad
but
the
balance
seems
a
bit
off
for
me
could
use
more
hop
flavour
and
less
bitterness
overall
i
think
this
worth
a
shot
i
have
been
drinking
a
lot
of
real
hoppy
west
coast
beers
lately
and
i
think
this
was
a
decent
change
of
pace
notes
i
would
love
this
on
tap
i
think
eipas
arent
my
usual
go
to
but
this
isnt
bad
at
all
a
good
counterpoint
of
sweet
bitter
is
the
big
accomplishment
i
found
in
this
ipa
just
when
the
sweetness
seemed
overstated
the
bitterness
kicked
in
every
sip
brought
similar
interplay
good
job
middle
ages
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
like
my
ipas
with
some
more
kick
as
in
hops
to
them
impaled
ale
is
one
of
the
best
ipas
that
i
have
tasted
in
quite
some
time
middle
ages
brewing
company
certainly
have
crafted
a
winner
with
this
offering
and
beer
drinkers
can
rest
assured
that
this
drinking
this
beer
will
be
far
more
enjoyable
than
actually
being
impaled
this
beer
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
thin
head
the
smell
is
is
very
sweet
malt
with
some
honey
and
floral
accents
the
taste
starts
off
right
away
with
some
hops
bite
that
continues
all
the
way
through
and
give
away
to
some
sweetness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
in
a
pleasant
way
and
for
a
vigorously
hopped
beer
it
is
very
palatable
overall
i
am
a
hop
lover
this
one
does
not
fit
that
bill
it
is
a
nice
smooth
easy
drinking
ipa
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
the
gateway
drinkers
d
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
brew
it
goes
with
the
saying
just
because
its
a
micro
doesnt
make
it
automatically
good
it
looks
and
smells
ok
but
the
taste
was
off
pours
a
very
slightly
hazed
amber
with
a
light
tan
head
that
really
sticks
around
i
cannot
remember
the
last
time
i
saw
this
much
retention
of
head
so
i
am
going
to
give
this
one
a
5
on
appearance
nose
is
very
hoppy
with
those
pine
and
citrus
tones
the
flavor
is
subdued
and
doesnt
present
itself
as
a
hop
bomb
or
that
style
it
is
more
of
a
gentle
hopped
ale
feel
is
thick
with
bubbles
and
slightly
meaty
on
the
liquid
definitely
drinkable
it
is
a
smooth
and
even
ipa
that
doesnt
have
any
overly
showy
attributes
i
would
be
interested
to
see
what
this
one
is
like
on
tap
or
better
yet
on
cask
d
good
for
the
style
refreshing
not
for
sessioning
as
the
hop
taste
is
overpowering
this
is
an
all
day
ipa
which
is
very
friendly
to
the
palate
worth
the
drive
an
hour
and
12
to
halftime
beverage
in
poughkeepsie
a
clear
amber
colored
brew
with
a
solid
clumpy
white
head
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
healthy
grapefruit
mixed
with
some
unique
bubblegumcandy
quality
interesting
and
enticing
the
taste
brings
out
more
toffee
and
some
licorice
along
with
the
clean
citrus
presence
all
in
a
very
creamy
delectable
package
nice
combination
of
sweet
and
bitter
with
a
malty
background
i
pick
up
some
bread
and
perhaps
currant
in
the
aftertaste
very
nice
stuff
recommended
to
most
anyone
pretty
drinkable
for
this
kind
of
brew
as
well
its
good
to
be
back
in
the
middle
ages
for
once
the
taste
lingered
long
and
confortably
in
my
mouth
with
little
carbonation
making
the
drinking
just
a
little
more
easier
despite
being
reasonably
complex
and
high
in
alcohol
it
was
very
drinkable
and
did
not
make
me
feel
weighed
down
after
it
good
well
balanced
ipa
no
one
flavor
is
too
overpowering
definatly
near
the
top
of
my
list
of
ipas
this
is
no
knock
your
socks
off
ipa
but
then
again
its
an
english
style
and
not
an
american
its
an
excellent
ipa
though
and
a
very
drinkable
one
just
finished
a
couple
of
these
while
watching
some
baseball
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
some
orange
hues
and
a
thick
white
head
smell
is
hoppy
with
some
fruit
notes
excellent
mouthfeel
taste
is
sweet
at
first
then
the
hops
kick
in
also
some
fruitiness
i
would
def
take
a
few
more
of
these
down
if
not
for
work
tomorrow
a
pretty
damn
solid
ipa
pretty
solid
englishstyle
ipa
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
drinkability
is
high
because
it
goes
down
so
smooth
this
ipa
with
a
brownish
orange
color
was
on
the
sweeter
side
of
life
for
my
taste
buds
the
hops
were
quite
herbal
and
piney
and
this
combined
with
the
sweetness
came
out
in
a
kind
of
pine
fresh
theme
there
wasnt
much
depth
to
the
the
mouthfeel
as
i
found
the
beer
to
be
somewhat
watery
but
still
a
decent
brew
worth
trying
pours
a
solid
clear
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
that
resists
fading
not
a
heck
of
a
lot
of
lacing
the
smell
is
nice
but
youve
really
got
to
let
it
warm
up
quite
a
bit
to
get
its
best
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
grassy
pine
medium
bodied
and
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
and
flavor
compliment
each
other
well
the
light
fruity
hop
is
balanced
with
a
sweet
malt
flavor
that
that
lets
you
know
its
there
the
hop
bitterness
lingers
appropriately
the
6

abv
is
well
hidden
a
good
drinker
and
a
local
favorite
cheers
this
beer
goes
down
smoothly
and
i
could
definitely
have
more
than
one
this
is
a
nice
reminder
that
i
need
to
drink
more
englishstyle
beers
it
should
also
be
noted
that
this
beer
seems
to
get
more
pleasant
as
it
warms
definitely
a
tasty
treat
and
i
would
drink
it
more
often
were
it
available
in
this
area
d
it
was
a
bit
hoppy

me

pretty

doverall
i
didnt
love
this
one
so
the
d
is
down
for
me
this
poured
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
the
color
was
a
hazy
mediumamber
it
had
a
good
floral
hoppy
nose
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
good
hoppy
presence
on
the
palate
the
finish
was
also
hoppy
but
offset
by
a
mild
malt
presence
smooth
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
finishes
somewhat
dry
good
sipper
pretty
sessionable
the
feel
is
smooth
although
maybe
a
little
ashy
at
the
tail
end
considering
how
bitter
this
baby
can
get
its
actually
remarkably
smooth
its
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
delicious
and
smooth
an
outstanding
full
brew
by
far
one
of
my
favorite
local
ipas
but
once
again
im
biased
this
is
another
beer
that
ive
always
seen
on
tap
in
the
front
room
at
the
brewery
and
for
good
reason
everytime
i
visit
i
make
sure
to
get
a
sample
of
this
delicious
brew
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
nice
foamy
head
smell
is
quite
citrusy
with
some
piney
scent
hops
are
obviously
present
with
a
pleasant
malt
background
good
work
middle
ages
keep
it
up
drinkability
overall
a
very
good
beer
in
a
category
with
lots
of
other
good
or
better
beers
definitely
a
respectable
offering
for
the
style
great
looking
ipa
with
a
monstrous
head
and
lacing
lasts
till
the
end
citrusy
hop
aromas
dominate
along
with
a
bready
malt
taste
in
no
different
clean
crisp
hops
smack
the
palate
with
a
nice
heavy
malt
backbone
while
the
beer
stays
on
the
light
mouthfeelwise
hop
profile
makes
this
one
a
contender
for
champion
of
ipa
trophy
in
my
opinion
d
this
is
by
no
means
an
english
ipa
far
too
much
grapefruit
but
it
does
have
a
lot
of
nice
malt
pretty
average
ok
pretty
good
ipa
and
quite
sessionable
not
sure
if
individual
scentsflavors
are
too
mild
to
pick
out
or
if
it
is
just
very
well
integrated
despite
lowish
score
i
would
drink
it
again
just
dont
think
it
matches
up
well
against
some
of
the
other
ipas
out
there
overall
i
dig
it
not
my
favorite
beer
but
a
good
introduction
to
ipas
for
me
i
wanna
try
more
after
this
d
nice
session
beer
but
getting
towards
the
strong
side
to
be
ripping
a
bunch
down
and
driving
around
i
fill
my
growler
drive
home
then
drink
it

pours
a
copper
with
lots
of
head
but
perhaps
not
the
best
pour
on
my
part
somewhat
of
a
malty
aroma
the
taste
hits
me
at
the
back
of
my
mouth
but
doesnt
seem
to
fill
the
rest
of
the
mouth
enough
some
hops
but
not
enough
interesting
about
this
one
i
love
middle
ages
marketing
scheme
but
im
disappointed
with
the
mediocre
tastes
in
so
many
of
their
offerings
this
is
another
underachieving
beer
it
has
a
great
deal
of
potential
but
the
taste
is
forgettable
had
from
a
cask
at
mahars
in
albany
the
beer
was
clear
golden
orange
color
with
thick
and
sticky
head
the
smell
was
dominated
by
fruity
aromas
with
some
strong
hops
presence
same
with
the
taste
both
aroma
and
flavor
were
solidly
above
average
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
much
higher
than
average
mostly
due
to
the
creamy
and
thick
mouthfeel
from
the
cask
a
nice
solid
english
style
ipa
d
middle
ages
makes
some
incredible
brews
i
feel
this
one
is
too
mainstream
for
them
i
guess
if
you
like
average
mainstream
versions
of
a
style
this
is
an
ok
beer
overall
a
nice
ale
a
hoppy
but
good
example
of
the
english
ipa
style
d
as
a
result
the
drinkability
is
high
an
easy
ipa
to
pound
md
i
was
pretty
harsh
on
this
beer
i
am
stuggling
to
make
it
through
the
sixer
maybe
ill
hand
it
off
as
a
gift
clever
name
the
brewery
should
do
this
to
this
beer
crux
not
the
best
beer
from
a
great
brewery
ill
keep
drinking

yeah
it

compared

ipas
it
also
has
the

distinct

as
the
chocolate

oatmeal
stouts
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
i
find
unibroue
to
have
the
same
theme
however
this
is
a
solid
beer
not
a
great
one
but
certainly
not
a
bad
one
would
i
buy
again
probably
not

the
beer
puts
forth
a
rising
head
of
spongy
off
white
foam
3
fingers
of
froth
rests
atop
a
tangerineorange
brew
of
notable
clarity
tons
of
lacing
hangs
around
as
the
foam
dissipates
beautiful
appearance
the
aroma
gives
off
biscuit
malts
and
only
traces
of
hops
certainly
not
nearly
as
aromatic
as
its
american
brethren
despite
the
lack
of
a
pronounced
hop
bouquet
it
is
still
hopforward
in
the
flavor
department
but
of
the
tame
citrus
variety
with
minimal
bitterness
they
definitely
put
a
leash
on
it
a
touch
of
toffee
and
some
metallic
accents
that
zing
your
tongue
theres
some
orange
sweetness
light
pine
and
fruity
esters
to
round
out
the
flavors
the
pleasant
and
slightly
dry
aftertaste
conjures
thoughts
of
herbal
tea
and
theres
a
good
mix
of
malt
and
hops
the
beer
is
effervescent
with
a
juicy
feel
a
pretty
solid
body
given
its
relative
lack
of
weight
overall
i
think
we
americans
have
been
spoiled
with
megaipas
that
obliterate
your
senses
this
is
a
refreshing
and
easy
alternative
with
a
historic
pedigree
and
distinguished
character
hopheads
may
find
this
leaving
them
a
little
wanting
but
if
you
can
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
its
great
balanced
refined
a
true
classic
poured
with
a
large
bubbly
creamy
head
not
much
aroma
light
malt
flavour
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nice
clean
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
found
this
unexeptional
but
overall
well
balanced
flavours
and
quite
an
enjoyable
pint
this
is
more
my
range
for
an
everyday
ipa
o
this
is
really
good
beer
and
i
think
it
deserves
a
better
score
i
think
the
challenge
for
us
american
ipa
drinkers
is
that
we
drink
hopped
up
versions
and
we
drink
an
english
ipa
and
think
something
is
missing
at
least
that
is
my
own
experience
but
if
i
am
ever
looking
for
an
ipa
that
is
not
hoppy
ill
reach
for
this
its
good
balanced
and
has
quality
today
i
bought
the
samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
94
and
the
india
ale
83
and
i
feel
like
the
scores
of
those
on
this
site
should
be
reversed
i
think
this
ipa
is
fantastic
it
isnt
like
most
ipas
that
get
high
reviews
here
but
it
is
none
the
less
extremely
good
the
taste
of
this
ipa
reminds
me
of
honey
in
a
very
good
way
and
it
is
so
drinkable
o
a
very
good
example
of
the
traditional
style
of
ipa
before
it
was
coopted
as
a
bitter
assault
on
the
tongue
very
flavorful
and
malty
while
providing

i
really
love
the
nose
and
the
front
of
this
beer
with
the
bright
floral
hops
and
honey
flavors
the
close
is
less
satisfying
i
can
deal
with
the
bitterness
but
the
medicinal
aspects
come
out
most
strongly
at
the
end
the
rating
would
be
north
of
4
but
for
this
aspect
of
the
finish
enjoyed
from
the
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
this
english
ipa
pours
a
beautiful
copper
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
dies
down
to
a
nice
pool
of
foam
with
light
lacing
nose
of
light
caramel
light
herbal
and
bittering
hops
and
light
bread
flavors
are
a
medium
caramel
malts
backbone
with
a
light
bready
flavor
that
gives
way
to
the
bittering
hops
in
the
background
high
carbonation
almost
seltzer
water
like
gives
it
a
crisp
mouth
feel
that
finishes
bracingly
bitter
without
being
over
the
top
a
solid
example
of
a
good
british
ipa
o
a
little
mineralheavy
a
pretty
decent
english
ipa
though
unfortunately
there
is
almost
zero
demand
for
the
style
here
in
the
states
quaint
seems
mild
and
unhoppy
compared
to
us
ipad
o
a
nice
change
of
pace
probably
reminiscent
of
india
ales
back
in
the
day
before
the
larger
variety
of
hops
available
now
its
a
refreshing
beer
but
not
what
i
like
in
ipas
tastes
more
like
a
crisp
pale
ale
to
me
as
far
as
an
english
style
ipas
though
its
a
good
one
so
up
yours
literally
as
in
drink
up
o
sour
lacking
depth
but
feels
like
youre
drinking
history
thin
especially
if
youve
been
drinking
a
lot
of
american
big
hops
but
still
good
somehow
more
than
the
sum

willingly

samuel

delivers
as
usual
o
not
my
favorite
from
sam
smith
however
i
would
enjoy
the
hell
out
of
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
this
beer
is
not
going
to
be
revisited
it
is
slightly
above
okay
o
not
my
favorite
ale
but
its
a
nice
changeup
at
times
i
like
this
one
really
cold
its
really
more
of
a
beer
for
a
quite
contemplative
evening
rather
than
a
refresher
after
sweaty
lawn
work
o
this
is
what
makes
a
good
english
style
pale
ale
nice
and
crispy
yet
full
of
flavors
the
english
touch
the
breadiness
and
toffeelike
character
makes
this
beer
a
winner
not
only
in
style
but
in
craft
poured
a
gorgeous
semiclear
golden
orange
with
one
finger
of
fluffy
white
head
that
grew
to
two
fingers
and
receded
slowly
leaving
lacing
down
the
glass
a
true
beauty
of
a
beer
one
of
the
best
looking
ipas
i
have
ever
seen
scents
of
abundant
floral
and
herbal
hops
with
notes
of
jasmine
and
lavender
an
earthy
hop
presence
is
also
discernible
alongside
hints
of
honey
and
crystal
malt
very
faint
traces
of
fruit
an
excellent
aroma
profile
that
is
rich
floral
earthy
and
pleasant
excellently
done
flavor
begins
with
a
nice
hit
of
floral
and
herbal
hops
with
a
slightly
medicinal
flavor
to
them
and
faint
honeylike
notes
and
toasted
malt
in
the
background
the
level
of
bitterness
is
lower
than
in
american
ipas
but
pleasant
and
true
to
style
these
flavors
continue
throughout
the
sip
and
are
joined
in
the
middle
by
a
nice
earthy
hoppy
character

overall
this
is
an
excellent

that
captures
the

and
spirit
of
the
style
perfectly
well
worth
having
at

themselves
followed

ale
from
one
of
the
best
breweries
on

planet
great
job
samuel
smith
o
this
is
a
mildly
bitter
beer
with
nothing
to
balance
it
out
no
sweetness
or
hops
to
give
any
other
character
i
like
samuel
smiths
as
a
brewery
but
this
is
not
their
best
offering
it
was
also
nice
that
it
was
on
sale
for
3
33
for
their
bomber
not
sure
if
its
too
bland
or
very
traditional
for
me
it
feels
like
one
of
the
original
ipas
an
extrahopped
british
ale
to
survive
the
long
trip
to
india
thus
a

purchased

havent
had
a

beer
by

yet
this
one
is
very
nice
really
liking
the
different
flavors
found
in
this
brew
nothing
like
the
typical
ipas
in
these
parts
a
nice
change
overall
pretty
solid
eipa
i
dig
it
another
good
installment
from
the
samuel

brewery
poured
from
the
bottle
into
an
english
pub
glass
notably
light
in
color
a
gold
yellow
with
a
formidable
dull
white
head
that
holds
its
shape
aroma
is
floral
and
fruity
reminiscent
of
black
tea
dried
apricots
perhaps
some
unlit
tobacco
faint
citrus
rind
some
classic
english
hop
aroma
but
overall
the
smell
is
restrained
palate
features
a
similarly
downplayed
malt
backbone
that
manifests
as
caramel
and
popcorn
with
the
odd
toasty
protuberance
a
hint
of
treacle
a
fruity
floral
bubble
gum
element
or
perhaps
grape
popsicle
and
the
black
teadried
fruit
notes
from
the
nose
gentle
on
the
mouth
despite
the
aggressive

and

side

including
a
lingering

as
well
as
a

bite
some
forest
floor
type
hop
effects
overall
my
impression
is
favorable
some
unique
hop
and
yeastderived
flavors
which
grew
on
me
as
i
made
my
way
through
an
initially
mellow
and
murky
pint
in
which
i
struggled
to
pinpoint
the
specific
flavors
prost
lampertland
o
not
what
you
would
expect
an
ipa
to
be
this
is
not
to
say
that
it
is
not
good
because
it
is
it
just
isnt
what
you
would
get
with
a
traditional
apa
or
ipa
this
is
a
session
ale
if
i
have
ever
had
one
it
reminds
me
so
much
of
the
other
british
pub
ales
i
have
had
and
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
but
if
you
are
expecting
an
american
ipa
look
elsewhere
o
this
is
a
hard
beer
to
rate
having
consumed
numerous
american
ipas
this
is
distinctly
different
i
think
overtime
it
could
win
me
over
for
the
sheer
fact
that
the
english
invented
ipa
so
they
could
ship
beer
to
india
without
spoilage
the
hop
flavors
are
not
as
pronounced
as
an
aipa
yet
the
bitterness
is
much
more
distinct
the
flavor
is
nice
but
does
not
stand
out
though
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
paired
against
some
spicy
indian
or
thai
fare
to
see
how
it
holds
up
with
the
bitterness
i
suspect
it
will
perform
quite
well
will
definitely
try
this
again
o
a
different
sort
of
english
ipa
with
more
hop
flavors
and
bitterness
than
i
expected
otherwise
rather
light
in
color
if
not
mouthfeel
for
an
english
ipa
still
in
all
a
different
and
tasty
brew
a
credit
to
the
venerable
samuel
smith
lineup
stands
up
well
against
the
average
hoppy
american
ipa
solid
copper
color
the
hops
and
malt
are
subtle
but
readily
apparent
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
all
english
i
dont
know
if
it
is
as
typically
strong
as
other
english
ipas
but
it
is
thoroughly
pleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
extraordinary
no
heavy
bitter
aftertaste
the
wellintegrated
hops
are
present
as
you
savor
not
afterward
the
malt
and
a
little
balanced
sweetness
are
what
stays
with
you
this
gets
solid
points
for
being
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
not
epically
brilliant
but
really
fantastic
for
a
session
i
will
get
this
again
without
question
overall
really
nice
british
ipa
with
a
great
malt
quality
the
hops
are
subtle
but
well
balanced
just
a
really
pleasant
british
ipa
to
drink
a
bright
crystal
clear
copper
color
whispy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
fairly
strong
and
hoppy
but
i
dont
dig
the
actual
smell
its
a
bit
too
earthy
taste
is
a
bit
too
herbal
and
earthy
for
me
as
well
for
an
ipa
i
know
its
an
english
ipa
but
the
flavors
just
dont
work
too
well
decent
malt
balance
medium
body
and
carbonation
o
a
nothing
special
beer
i
will
forget
quickly
i
revisied
this
one
after
23
years
since
my
last
review
and
it
seems
even
better
than
i
remember
this
beer
is
so
well
balanced
it
hits
all
the
flavor
profiles
you
expect
from
an
ale
into
one
bready
and
rich
some
caramel
sweetness
very
full
bodied
especially
for
a
5
0
abv
beer
then
you
get
the
hop
crispness
english
style
ipas
are
so
nice
a
variety
they
need
to
be
visited
much
more
often
after
having
so
many
of
the
american
hopped
varieties
this
is
a
wonderful
departure
and
compliment
i
associate
samuel
smith
with
quality
and
this
beer
is
another
example
of
a
great
quality
beer
a
traditional
english
ipa
dont
expect
a
hop
soup
it
is
a
malty
beer
if
compared
to
nowadays
ipas
final
grade

a
b
samuel
smiths
india
ale
is
a
finely
crafted
ale
but
it
really
isnt
blowing
me
away
as
this
brewery
so
often
manages
this
might
be
my
least
favourite
samuel
smiths
brew
so
far
reminds
me
strongly
of
wells
ipa
except
with
a
much
more
appealing
aroma
and
complex
hop
bill
this
brew
provides
plenty
of
leafy
english
hop
bitterness
which
may
or
may
not
appeal
to
fans
of
the
american
style
youll
have
to
judge
this
one
on
your
own
i
still
like
this
beer
and
would
recommend
it
as
a
solid
example
of
the
style
but
its
not
a
musttry
o
i
drank
this
14
months
from
when
it
was
bottled
so
that
could
have
affected
my
review
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
probably
my
first
british
style
ipa
however
it
is
lacking
in
the
areas
of
complexity
as
well
as
abv
this
beer
isnt
exactly
session
able
yet
the
abv
is
in
the
range
of
a
session
beer
if
i
see
this
again
and
its
fresh
i
will
probably
pick
it
up
to
give
it
another
shot
overall
i
bought
this
because
i
truly
love
some
of
the
other
beers
by
samuel
smiths
but
this
one
just
doesnt
compare
im
not
saying
its
bad
but
to
me
it
is
definitely
pretty
plain
glad
to
say
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
be
buying
again
othis
beer
is
not
as
hoppy
as
an
american
ipa
and
has
a
malt
flavor
that
blends
well
in
the
mouth
yet
it
leaves
you
with
a
good
hop
aftertaste
overall
an
english
ipa
with
a
twist
the
beer
has
a
rather
aggressive
burnt
toast
flavor
to
it
interesting
yet
drinkable
hazy
light
amber
with
2
fingers
of
off
white
head
bitter
hops
and
malt
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
very
mild
with
not
a
large
hop
presence
mild
english
hops
are
balanced
by
a
slightly
sweet
malt
and
there
is
a
surprising
amount
of
bitterness
creamy
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
it
was
a
bit
watery
tasting
however
a
decent
beer
from
sam
smiths
but
one
of
my
least
favorites
from
them
ill
stick
with
oatmeal
stout
and
ris
overall
3

great
beer
and
a
fantastic
introduction
to
the
ancestor
of
americas
current
brewing
obsession
the
ipa
this
beer
is
not
hopfocused
and
in
fact
it
seems
that
certain
special
malts
and
perhaps
a
yeast
strain
have
been
chosen
for
their
ability
to
mask
or
perhaps
better
match
the
large
number
of
hops
used
in
this
brew
this
is
a
malty
biscuity
somewhat
dry
brew
but
it
is
very
refreshing
and
would
be
excellent
with
food
certainly
worth
a
try
for
any
of
my
fellow
continental
hopheads
but
taste
it
with
an
education
about
what
you
are
drinking
this
is
not
an
american
ipa
and
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
o
a
decent
beer
my
first
english
ipa
i
will
say
i
prefer
the
hoppier
american
version
but
id
like
to
sample
others
from
this
style
i
like
the
maltiness
which
gives
it
a
lager
feel
to
an
extent
the
taste
itself
mixes
lots
of
malt
and
fruitiness
and
the
taste
isnt
bad
its
just
a
bit
watery
decent
beer
i
can
see
myself
drinking
it
again
but
i
wont
actively
seek
it
overall
a
very
nice
ale
rich
but
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
refreshing
beer
too
o
i
havent
had
this
in
years
and
im
enjoying
it
it
was
part
of
a
back
with
2
other
brews
2

nd
the

a
nice
brew
that
i
wish
i
could
buy

is
very
well

with
hardly
any

noticed
after

overall
this
is
a
very
good
english
ipa
style
very
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
hop
and
malt
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
small
white
head
dissipates
very
quickly
smells
of
grassy
and
floral
hops
very
nice
tastes
of
earthy
hops
and
nice
grain
that
adds
a
little
sweetness
beer
is
slightly
overcarbonated
but
for
its
light
body
goes
down
really
well
overall
an
above
average
beer
not
bad
by
samuel
smith
standards
yet
not
nearly
as
balanced
or
drinkable
as
their
standard
bitter
offerings
as
well
in
terms
of
setting
the
historical
recipe
of
british
ipas
this
is
a
very
nice
tribute
and
recreation
of
the
now
highly
pepped
up
and
competitive
beer
style
i
would
imagine
this
is
better
fresh
what
with
all
these
alpha
acids
falling
apart
at
this
point
this
paired
very
well
with
chinese
food
and
at
this
point
i
couldnt
imagine
not
pairing
it
with
something
international
given
the
context
worth
a
try
but
not
as
essential
as
their
other
beers
the
nose
was
hops
first
and
foremost
although
the
malt
content
doesnt
hide
away
either
the
taste
is
very
simular
to
what
the
aroma
hints
at
a
hop
fronted
malt
laden
brew
with
a
good
depth
of
flavours
fairly
dry
at
times
but
a
very
good
brew
and
ideal
for
the
moment
when
i
opened
this
bottle
overall
i
enjoyed
this
traditional
english
ipa
very
much
if
i
had
gone
into
it
expecting
a
west
coaststyle
hop
blast
i
would
have
been
disappointed
but
i
didnt
and
i
wasnt
ill
drink
this
beer
again
for
sure
poured
from
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
very
small
amount
head
disappeared
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
much
darker
than
expected
with
a
dark
amber
color
doesnt
look
like
most
ipas
not
very
bitter
or
fruity
like
the
label
suggests
the
heavy
malt
flavoraroma
jumps
out
immediately
and
remains
i
prefer
the
american
version
but
this
is
still
a
solid
offering
the
first
thing
from
sam
smiths
that
hasnt
wowed
me
in
fact
i
didnt
even
really
like
this
brew
and
think
it
flawed
in
some
ways
it
pours
a
fine
shade
of
amber
like
light
maple
syrup
and
has
a
decent
head
about
an
inch
and
a
half
tall
but
it
doesnt
last
the
nose
is
sort
of
drab
stale
hops
and
sweeter
english
malts
that
dont
taste
particularly
fresh
themselves
is
smells
like
wort
not
beer
honestly
sort
of
weird
the
flavor
is
also
sort
of
dull
i
was
hoping
for
a
lot
more
hops
here
but
they
just
never
come
its
like
a
movie
without
a
climax
there
is
also
some
dusty
flavor
that
is
out
of
place
it
just
doesnt
come
together
for
me
the
way
the
other
sam
smith
beers
do
the
yeast
stands
out
more
than
it
probably
should
in
this
style
too
its
lacking
carbonation
being
pretty
close
to
flat
and
that
makes
it
a
bit
heavy
and
filling
to
drink
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
something
because
i
expect
much
higher
quality
from
sam
smiths
now
i
also
had
this
after
a
couple
of
pretty
mean
american
india
pale
ales
so
perhaps
my
palate
didnt
do
justice
to
this
beer
as
it
otherwise
might
have
i
will
have
to
revisit
this
in
the
future
o
a
very
sessionable
and
traditional
tasting
english
ipa
worthy
of
regular
purchase
strangely
spicy
but
it
does
wear
our
its
welcome
quite
malty
but
with
a
touch
of
the
metallic
or
else
its
just
a
serious
amount
of
the
british
mineral
water
taste
a
little
sharp
but
pleasantly
sudsy
in
the
mouth
only
2
50
for
this
16
oz
bottle
and
other
samuel
smith
beers
at
a
liquor
store
where
you
can
wire
money
to
the
gormless
youth
in
your
life
india
ale
pours
a
clear
dark
golden
color
with
a
long
lasting
head
the
aroma
is
rather
malty
with
hints
of
the
floral
hops
coming
through
the
taste
has
a
strong
malty
backbone
with
hints
of
a
sweet
hoppyness
near
the
end
full
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
taste
more
like
a
pilsner
but
there
are
hoppeir
pilsners
out
there
but
still
not
a
bad
beer
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
ipa
im
not
a
hop
head
so
this
fits
the
bill
perfectly
for
me
i
also
feel
that
this
is
a
world
class
beer
and
am
now
a
strong
fan
of
samuel
smith
old
brewery
which
is
now
on
my
bucket
list
of
breweries
to
tour
o
quite
drinkable
and
plasant
british
style
ipa
nice
and
smooth
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
it
is
unique
in
its
lightness
and
flavor
even
thought
it
is
not
very
strong
5
abv
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
with
good
a
good
balance
of
flavors
the
bottle
says
its
exceptionally
fullflavored
and
complex
which
i
found
to
be
an
exaggeration
it
is
by
far
not
a
bad
beer
its
just
not
very
interesting
it
is
malty
and
hoppybitter
which
is
true
to
its
category
but
lacks
some
depth
or
layers
of
flavor
you
get
with
other
ipas
o
truly
how
ipa
was
meant
to
be
flavorful
and
drinkable
it
is
not
overpowering
and
does
not
burn
the
palate
just
right
even
for
a
hop
lover
like
me
overall
a
simple
easy
drinking
brew
and
truly
english
in
flavor
it
will
do
o
not
one
of
my
first
choices
of
samuel
smith
but
far
from
something
to
snub
your
nose
at
o
save
your
money
and
try
this
companys
old
brewery
pale
ale
would
be
my
suggestion
its
not
terrible
in
any
way
and
frankly
im
not
sure
how
qualified
i
am
to
score
an
english
ipa
because
this
might
be
the
only
one
ive
tried
if
were
being
technical
and
staying
strictly
within
the
confines
of
each
defined
beer
style
but
for
the
price
i
think
you
can
get
more
arrogant
bastard
and
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
for
the
same
money
so
do
so
i
probably
sound
like
im
really
down
on
it
but
as
far
as
beers
go
and
eipas
its
a
good
beer
just
not
great
and
if
you
want
the
real
bold
bitter
hop
feel
youll
have
to
look
elsewhere
for
sam
smiths
this
brew
was
a
disappointment
i
was
hoping
for
what
i
feel
to
be
a
classic
eipa
and
got
really
nothing
special
fairly
standard
pale
ale
with
a
bit
of
extra
hops
to
the
finish
again
expectations
play
their
part
in
this
but
judging
from
others
perspectives
im
not
alone
in
thinking
that
this
brew
could
have
been
a
lot
better
o
i
knew
it
was
an
english
ipa
but
i
struggle
to
even
give
it
that
label
the
absence
of
flavoring
hops
and
the
big
malt
character
comprises
the
800
pound
gorilla
in
the
room
just
isnt
what
i
expected
maybe
its
an
age
issue
there
was
no
date
on
the
bottle
i
could
find
probably
will
stick
with
their
darker
beers
in
the
future
poured
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
white
foamy
head
aromas
of
english
malts
cereal
grains
and
spicy
hops
sweet
ripe
dark
fruits
up
front
with
more
citruslike
flavors
coming
through
later
bitter
finish
but
not
too
dry
carbonation
just
right
hops
are
bitter
but
not
as
piney
or
grapefruity
as
most
american
ipas
and
more
complex
still
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
o
this
is
a
very
solid
balanced
eipa
samuel
smith
consistently
sells
great
beers
at
a
great
price
a
solid
if
unspectacular
example
of
an
eipa
not
the
best
samuel
smiths
but
even
at
their
worst
theyre
better
than
most

and

was

it

at

a

the
pale

skates
by

to
cross

a

for

this
brew
pours
a
clear
deep
reddishorange
color
the
head
is
massive
rocky
and
white
lacing
is
thorough
the
aroma
is
samuel

house
aroma
with
some
fruity
citric
notes
the
taste
is
a
lot
bigger
than
the
aroma
citrus
and
pine
dominate
but
do
not
overpower
like
other
samuel

beers
the
mouthfeel
is
incredible
smooth
creamy
medium
bodied
and
with
perfect
carbonation
for
this
style
overall
this
is
a
great
ipa
the
beer
wasnt
too
light
but
i
could
definately
enjoy
more
than
one
the
8
price
tag
for
a
bottle
is
what
would
stop
me
this
is
a
nice
ipa
when
you
need
a
change
from
the
usual
american
offerings
first
thing
i
noticed
when
i
opened
the
bottle
was
a
pungent
smell
similar
to
whiskey
it
is
a
fantastic
smell
it
is
an
amber
colored
beer
witha
light
head
and
tons
of
sticking
to
the
glass
lots
of
carbonation
it
has
the
great
flavor
i
come
to
expect
from
british
ales
a
ton
of
diacetyl
the
hops
are
not
the
same
bitter
hot
hops
of
america
a
lot
smoother
and
more
balanced
than
you
may
be
used
to
the
beer
is
medium
and
dry
a
great
beer
from
samuel
smith
im
liking
this
a
lot
it
reminds
me
of
their
organice
ale
but
with
nice
hoppy
bitterness
very
well
balanced
a
quality
brew
but
one
ill
only
grab
on
occcasion
the
flavor
as
one
would
expect
from
an
ipa
was
predominantly
hoppy
a
nice
smooth
carmel
flavor
seemed
to
mellow
out
the
bitterness
a
tad
also
just
a
bit
of
a
butterscotchy
malty
flavor
in
the
finish
md
the
mouthfeel
is
delicately
soft
and
ultrasmooth
matching
the
equally
softtextured
flavour
just
ideally
overall
this
beer
is
quite
understated
than
the
broadly
defined
ipa
from
my
limited
experience
of
this
style
not
as
bold
and
colourful
as
other
ipas
ive
tried
from
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
its
strength
hides
in
its
subtlety
and
that
it
drinks
only
too
well
based
on
its
balanced
characters
with
good
depth
overall
i
think
this
is
pretty
drinkable
i
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
and
will
certainly
drink
the
rest
of
this
fourpack
but
i
dont
yearn
for
another
right
away
and
at
10
00
a
pack
it
seems
a
bit
steep
id
still
go
with
bridgeport
or
sweetwater
for
a
nice
ipa
but
this
is
nice
in
a
pinch
or
as
a
change
of
pace
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
whole
bottle
but
chose
to
share
this
one
with
a
friend
its
different
than
the
masala
mama
ipa
that
we
get
at
town
hall
but
unique
and
tasty
in
its
own
way
i
a
selfstated
hopfiend
enjoyed
this
brew
it
was
different
and
pleasingly
so
not
too
heavy
with
different
flavors
and
textures
going
on
than
your
average
ipa
cheers
sam
smith
for
raising
my
eyebrow
a
few
times
sam
smiths
makes
good
beer
overall
very
boring
the
only
thing
that
stands
out
is
the
aftertaste
which
i
find
harsh
and
unpleasant
much
better
british
ipas
out
there
and
if
i
purchase
a
sam
smiths
product
it
will
be
one
of
their
many
other
fabulous
offerings
mouthfeel
was
slightly
dry
as
it
should
be
with
ipa
drinkability
i
think
speaks
for
itself
i
will
buy
this
beer
over
and
over
again
besides
it
took
the
sting
off
of
msus
godawful
performance
against
northwestern
smell
is
awesome
floral
but
not
too
sweet
only
a
little
bitter
taste
is
really
pleasing
malts
are
mellowed
and
refreshing
balanced
well
with
only
moderate
hoppiness
not
too
thin
either
overall
it
is
wonderfully
enjoyable
and
a
nice
change
from
the
obsenely
strong
ipas
of
the
west
coast
a
good
ale
to
sit
down
with
when
youre
not
craving
hops
at
the
lower
end
of
samuel
smiths
brews
its
still
worth
trying
perhaps
a
good
transitional
brew
for
maltheads
finished
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
clean
could
drink
several
just
a
bit
weak
for
the
style
delicous
throughout
this
india
ale
is
a
classy
story
book
of
what
ales
are
supposed
to
be
characterful
balanced
and
gentlemanly
from
skin
to
core
a
lovely
beer
throughout
drinkability

nothing
overly
impressive
but
i
will
drink
it
again
its
medium
bodied
has
a
dense
and
soft
mouthfilling
carbonation
not
like
the
intense
ipas
thatll
curl
your
tie
its
balanced
and
smooth
its
not
tame
but
it
is
domesticated
highly
recommended
overall
a
decent
ipa
not
what
i
expected
at
all
if
this
were
labeled
pale
ale
but
not
overdone
as
a
result
dissipated
fast
carbonation
was
light
not
flat
with
hops
providing
some
pine
and
herbal
grassiness
which
blend
with
the
quite
toasty

you

in

this
is
what
you
would
have
been

that
was
then
and
right
now
id
far
rather
be
sipping
a
bigass
dirtcheap
local
hop
monster
its
a
good
beer
but
its
hard
to
get
too
excited
about
it
nuzzles
into
the
glass
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
that
fades
quickly
has
a
thick
honeylike
appearance
with
extensive
clouding
and
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
smell
is
fragrant
almost
fruity
but
surprisingly
weak
in
short
not
what
youd
expect
from
a
good
ipa
this
ipa
starts
malty
smooth
and
becomes
a
sharp
oatinfused
hop
edge
to
a
slightly
sour
apple
flavor
it
is
mediumbodied
the
finish
is
somewhat
dry
with
a
strong
lingering
aftertaste
pours
with
a
dark
copper
color
with
little
head
the
smell
is
much
less
pronounced
when
compared
with
other
ipas
a
welcome
change
for
me
at
least
the
taste
is
the
same
way
very
understated
and
taking
some
time
for
the
full
flavor
to
come
about
when
you
hold
it
in
your
mouth
a
fruity
taste
takes
hold
then
when
you
swallow
it
the
traditional
ipa
taste
emerges
but
its
mixed
with
the
same
potpourri
of
fruit
unlike
many
of
the
samuel
smiths
i
feel
as
though
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
and
not
get
tired
of
the
taste
great
for
an
ipa
fan
who
is
looking
for
a
larger
taste
out
of
their
beers
pours
a
hazy
full
copper
color
and
is
topped
by
a
two
finger
thick
frothy
tan
colored
head
the
aroma
is
of
ripe
fruit
plums
apple
strawberry
earthy
hops
and
a
component
that
reminds
me
of
oxidation
the
taste
is
thin
and
dead
on
the
front
of
my
tongue
and
unfortunately
the
rest
of
this
beer
does
not
get
much
better
there
are
notes
of
cider
wan
stale
malt
and
cardboard
despite
putting
this
beer
in
a
brown
bottle
this
beer
is
still
quite
stale
and
lame
orangegold
colour
with
a
white
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
tenaciously
and
forms
a
white
island
of
foam
in
the
middle
of
the
ale
smells
of
fruit
strawberry
and
bananna
and
a
bit
of
hops
and
malt
tastes
fruity
with
a
caramel
hint
hoppy
but
not
enough
in
my
opinion
a
bit
of
malt
comes
through
nicely
balancing
the
hops
pretty
smooth
for
an
ipa
none
of
the
characteristic
bitterness
that
i
enjoy
smooth
and
a
bit
oily
in
the
mouth
with
ample
carbonation
a
bit
of
pepperyness
but
not
enough
in
my
opinion
very
drinkable
though
because
of
its
smoothness
and
low
abv
all
in
all
a
decent
eipa
a
good
median
example
of
the
style
but
not
the
best
of
the
best
at
best
an
average
tasting
version
of
the
style
not
too
flattering
in
terms
of
flavor
unfortunately
one
of
sammy
smiths
to
pass
on
mouthfeel
smooth
and
finely
carbonated
a
definite
session
beer
and
the
best
britain
beer
ive
had
in
a
bottle
the
taste
was
initially
bitter
and
very
smooth
it
was
a
little
astringent
and
a
bit
nutty
with
traces
of
woodiness
not
as
hoppy
as
i
would
have
liked
although
it
went
down
easily
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
still
rather
drinkable
this
poured
a
deep
golden
almost
copper
nice
head
with
good
retention
aroma
was
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
hop
whiff
taste
is
hop
bite
on
the
start
followed
by
a
nice
malty
fruity
mellowing
hint
of
floral
also
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
excellent
quality
brew
i
will
have
again
pours
a
pretty
amber
gold
with

and

offwhite
head
that
sticks
arounda
few
minutes
aroma
is
herbal
smoky

not
sharp
and
strong
like
us
ipas
quite
mellow

definite

presence
flaovors
are
more
like
a
us
pale
ale
rather
than
an
ipa
are
there
hops
sure
and
quite
nice
at
that
but
not
strong
this
is
actually
pretty
nicely
balanced
and
enjoyable
and
best
of
all
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
when
you
want
more
than
one
this
stuff
has
an
amazing
head
taller
thicker
and
leaves
more
lace
than
any
other
samuel
smith
beer
smell
and
taste
are
good
less
hoppy
than
most
ipas
i
didnt
really
like
the
mouthfeel
of
this
one
thoughtoo
thin
not
too
impressed
with
this
beer
but
not
too
shabby
id
buy
it
again
still
it
leaves
the
mouth
a
little
sugary
and
that
gets
annoying
if
you
only
want
a
single
clear
copper
color
white
fastfading
head
leaves
a
ring
of
bubbles
around
the
glass
smells
very
lightly
of
sweet
floral
hops
fairly
muted
for
my
american
ipa
taste
metallic
and
hopcentric
but
with
a
sweet
malty
twist
not
comparable
to
the
hop
profile
of
an
american
ipa
but
for
being
an
eipa
it
is
pretty
good
very
drinkable
and
nonintrusive
the
beer
pours
a
fairly
opaque
amber
color
with
a
fairly
small
white
head
head
retention
is
minimal
but
leaves
a
pretty
lace
smells
of
roasted
hops
and
caramel
plus
some
other
fruity
aromas
love
the
smell
the
taste
is
no
exception
i
love
this
beer
and
will
definately
buy
another
in
the
near
future
another
great
one
from
sam
smiths
pours
a
golden
amber
color
kinda
cloudy
with
a
nice
creamy
offwhite
head
somewhat
tan
smell
is
slightly
citrus
of
some
type
with
some
kind
of
spice
maybe
it
also
smells
of
hops
the
smell
is
pretty
sweet
there
may
be
a
hint
of
caramel
in
there
taste
good
not
sure
what
it
is
exactly
though
the
aftertaste
is
definitely
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
as
far
as
mouthfeel
goes
it
is
lightly
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
not
too
thick
or
thin
pretty
good
but
nothing
exceptional
id
drink
it
again
and
may
buy
it
often
due
to
its
not
very
expensive
price
pretty
good
overall
anyone
expecting
this
to
be
a
breakthrough
ale
may
be
disappointed
and
i
like
a
good
aggressive
american
style
ipa
as
much
as
most
anyone
but
sitting
here
late
on
a
sunday
night
winding
down
the
weekend
this
goes
really
good
pours
a
deep
rich
golden
color
with
a
small
stark
white
head
aroma
is
slightly
malty
and
biscuity
with
a
light
citrusy
hoppiness
wet
slightly
foamy
mouthfeel
is
just
a
little
thin
but
still
nice
palate
is
very
wellbalanced
light
rich
malt
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
is
complemented
by
lemony
hops
the
aftertaste
is
a
slightly
bitter
with
a
nice
buttery
character
not
perfect
for
sessions
but
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
this
is
a
very
good
beer
just
remember
it
is
an
english
ipa
and
not
an
american
ipa
so
it
is
not
a
hop
monster
drinkability
i
have
to
say
when
i
think
of
sam
smiths
adding
to
its
smoothness
with
a
delicate
mouthfeel
nicely
sweet
and
caramelly
in
regards
to
the
malt
but
i
always
wonder
how
fresh
it
is
and
if
that
would
throw
off
the
review
while
worthwhile
leaning
more
towards
the
light
side
and
very
smooth
this
is
a
weird
beer
for
me
it
just
seems
really
too
sweet
to
be
an
indian
ale
but
im
no
expert
the
alcohol
is
quite
low
for
an
indian
ale
as
well
and
is
barely
noticeable
its
a
good
beer
without
a
doubt
but
i
prefer
something
a
little

here
a
its

really
nice
to
view
and
appreciate
what
it
takes
to
make
such
an
ale
malty
aromas
trying
to
break
above
the
overwhelming
hoppiness
nothing
too
in
your
face
and
one
that
leaves
you
ready
for
another
its
not
a
u

but
you
can
see
where
those
come
from
got
to
respect
that
ehh

its
not

but
it
is

with

of

dignified
unexpected
and
well
done
i
liked
this
beer
it
was
a
good
beer
but
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
it
wasnt
really
inspiring
a
little
bit
of
something
drifts
up
over
an
inherent
floral
hop
aroma
to
suggest
a
coming
bitterness
fairly
nondescript
malt
and
herbal
flavor
yields
to
a
bitter
dry
finish
good
and
very
easy
to
drink
upon
opening
this
ale
it
immediately
foamed
up
and
overflowed
the
bottle
it
had
been
sitting
in
the
fridge
for
several
days
to
cool
it
down
needless
to
say
it
is
highly
carbonated
its
aroma
is
nice
with
a
nonoffensive
smell
the
carbonation
lasts
well
into
the
sample
it
is
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
long
lasting
head
mostly
due
to
the
continuous
carbonation
the
taste
is
mild
with
only
a
small
initial
flavor
its
after
taste
does
last
for
a
minute
but
is
well
rounded
in
its
flavor
tonight
i
review
samuel
smiths
india
ale
and
my
expectations
are
high
poured
a
deep
golden
to
light
amber
with
an
incredible
head
that
reduces
quickly
to
a
thin
sticky
layer
with
good
lacing
smells
are
faint
but
sweet
malty
and
breadyvery
enticing
the
first
sip
demands
my
taste
buds
stand
at
attention
with
some
nice
hoppy
bitterness
with
moves
into
a
creamy
buttermilk
biscuit
flavors
with
hints
of
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
is
has
a
nice
creamy
finish
i
have
read
several
reviews
stating
that
this
beer
is
not
as
intense
as
some
ipas
however
this
is
my
first
and
i
can
not
draw
the
same
conclusions
ultimately
high
intensity
is
not
necessarily
what
makes
a
beer
rate
high
in
my
book
s
smiths
ipa
is
perfectly
balanced
with
the
flavors
it
presents
and
as
its
not
overly
bitter
it
is
extremely
drinkable
i
bought
a
single
of
this
to
review
and
try
for
the
first
time
and
next
time
i
will
buy
the
whole
six
pack
this
beer
utterly
confused
me
the
entire
time
i
was
not
sure
what
i
was
drinking
was
it
a
ipa
as
the
label
alleged
or
was
this
something
else
entirely
did
i
get
a
bad
bottle
regardless
it
poured
a
foggy
copper
hue
with
a
tiny
bit
of
white
head
the
india
had
a
very
fruity
nose
with
an
abbundence
of
rose
petal
like
malts
and
not
anything
in
the
way
of
hops
same
could
be
said
for
the
taste
it
was
thin
and
sweet
almost
like
a
cider
with
lots
of
caramel
malts
i
am
not
entirely
sure
what
to
think
of
it
i
liked
it
but
was
it
a
ipa
or
some
other
strange
beer
give
it
a
try
and
let
me
know
differently
pours
a
very
translucent
amber
a
nice
sized
white
head
diminishes
slowly
leaving
some
lacing
behind
the
remnants
of
the
head
form
a
thin
film
of
bubbles
for
the
duration
of
the
beers
existence
smells
fairly
mild
a
hint
of
floral
or
citris
aromas
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
tingles
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
a
very
pleasant
hoppy
taste
is
also
present
but
much
more
mild
than
that
of
many
other
ipas
finishes
smooth
and
crisp
as
others
have
pointed
out
this
india
ale
has
all
of
the
characteristics
including
abv
of
an
english
pale
ale
it
has
a
nice
flavor
with
hints
of
biscuit
and
a
bit
of
caramel
it
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
though
again
its
not
quite
what
would
be
expected
of
an
ipa
like
many
others
here
ive
had
my
palate
set
by
us
ipas
particularly
westcoasters
with
tons
of
hops
this
is
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
but
not
a
goto
when
it
comes
to
ipas
pours
a
colorful
amber
with
a
thick
and
active
head
incredible
lacing
and
stickiness
throughout
a
malty
hoppy
and
spicy
aroma
very
nice
complex
flavors
some
malts
and
yeasty
fruitiness
noted
up
front
the
obvious
hops
are
there
but
not
overly
aggressive
some
citrus
and
grassy
undertones
make
this
one
standout
a
pleasant
dryness
combined
with
light
bitterness
on
the
palate
that
leaves
you
yearning
for
more
incredible
flavors
ever
so
smooth
and
slick
incredible
and
enjoyable
call
it
a
staple
i
could
drink
this
every
day
and
be
a
very
happy
man
i
like
a
wellbalanced
brew
love
some
hops
but
want
some
malt
with
it
in
other
words
this
could
be
my
ideal
beer
the
hops
are
more
understated
than
american
ipas
which
is
a
good
thing
imo
it
pours
an
ambercopper
color
dark
for
the
style
the
head
isnt
big
but
lasts
you
know
from
the
aroma
alone
that
its
well
balanced
because
the
malt
and
hops
both
come
through
mouthfeel
is
smooth
as
silk
i
cant
put
my
fingers
on
all
the
tastes
but
there
is
some
toasted
malts
a
buttery
toffee
and
a
bitterness
in
the
dry
finish
i
reluctantly
handed
the
glass
to
my
wife
and
asked
if
she
could
think
of
any
way
to
improve
this
brew
i
dont
know
what
she
said
i
dove
right
back
in
when
she
handed
the
glass
back
and
started
talking
the
point
is
i
had
to
ask
because
i
wouldnt
have
changed
anything
about
it
copperamber
color
with
a
rather
small
head
its
instantly
recognizable
as
an
english
hoppy
ale
i
love
these
british
hops
this
does
seem
more
like
an
esb
or
extra
hoppy
pale
ale
rather
than
and
ipa
but
whatever
its
a
very
enjoyable
brew
it
has
a
nice
malty
start
and
the
spicy
hops
after
that
i
really
enjoy
the
character
of
hops
from
this
country
i
still
must
say
fullers
is
king
but
this
stuff
is
great
this
is
one
of
the
few
sam
smiths
beers
i
have
had
out
here
on
the
west
coast
that
hasnt
been
oxidixized
skunky
or
well
passed
its
prime
poured
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
generous
amount
of
head
aroma
were
of
hops
but
not
nearly
as
strong
as
you
would
find
in
a
nw
ipa
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
some
bitterness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
grapefruit
and
other
citrus
flavors
come
through
clearly
on
the
tongue
a
fine
british
ipa
oh
yes
this
is
a
classic
appears
the
majestic
amber
copper
tone
with
an
amazing
beige
cream
toned
head
to
complement
the
body
aroma
is
decent
floral
hops
with
a
nice
underlying
malt
profile
very
good
flavor
that
is
tag
teamed
with
some
pine
cone
hops
accompanying
the
malty
molasses
like
sweetness
the
taste
is
butterscotch
malt
profile
brought
on
by
the
open
fermentation
that
this
and
other
sam
smith
beers
under
go
the
nice
rolling
hop
profile
is
a
creamy
buttery
combo
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
if
you
like
ipas
this
is
a
classic
british
ipa
to
get
started
on
before
getting
kicked
in
the
teeth
with
some
cascade
hops
from
the
american
counterparts
we
have
all
come
to
know
and
love
drinkabilitynotes
very
pleasant
lacks
the
typical
heavyhanded
hop
character
of
american
ipas
while
still
boasting
a
solid
hop
backbone
a
very
good
beer
that
exudes
quality
as
far
as
im
concerned
samuel
smiths
beers
are
the
archetypes
of
their
respective
genres
as
such
i
was
excited
to
try
his
india
ale
whoever
sam
smith
is
or
was
hes
still
alive
and
well
in
my
inebriated
mind
in
reading
about
india
pale
ales
i
had
thought
i
would
be
in
for
one
hell
of
a
hoppy
experience
but
to
my
pleasant
surprise
sam
smiths
india
ale
was
remarkably
balanced
light
brown
hue
and
a
conservative
head
im
a
proud
pale
ale
man
and
this
is
one
medal
im
happy
to
wear
i
can
only
hope
theyll
all
be

again
more

of

nowhere

see
so
often
in

this
beer
isnt

as

ipas
but
its
still
a
great
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
little
to
no
headmine
had
been
onthe
shelf
for
awhile
and
developed
a
winey
smell
to
it
but
it
held
up
well
the
malt
in
this
ipa
was
very
evident
upfront
with
a
good
hpsmack
in
the
end
a
very
well
made
ipa
even
sitting
on
shelf
for
almost
a
year
u
could
taste
the
flavors
of
a
very
good
wellmade
ale
not
a
bad
brew
but
nothing
special
the
sweetness
was
a
tad
much
for
me
i
am
glad
to
see
sam
smith
using
a
brown
bottle
for
this
beer
of
the
woods
this
beer
poured
a
dark
amer
color
with
a
white
head
that
crested
at
three
fingers
then
reduced
down
to
about
a
quarter
inch
the
lacing
was
minimal
there
wasnt
much
aroma
happening
here
but
there
was
a
little
bit
of
a
fruity
smell
i
guess
you
could
add
hops
to
that
because
they
were
noticeable
as
well
it
just
wasnt
very
strong
the
taste
was
hoppy
and
a
bit
fruity
there
just
wasnt
anything
that
jumped
out
in
the
taste
besides
the
hops
the
finish
was
slightly
bitter
but
not
enough
for
this
style
this
brew
seemed
to
have
a
lot
of
carbonation
maybe
a
little
too
much
i
wasnt
real
impressed
with
this
brew
although
i
would
drink
it
again
a
terrifically
wellrounded
brew
and
very
drinkable
finish
is
simple
sweet
and
everlasting
another
excellent
smith
offering
pours
out
copper
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
good
malthop
balance
a
bit
of
a
tea
thing
going
on
here
too
i
think
but
that
may
just
be
the
english
in
it
very
easy
to
drink
interesting
flavor
but
far
from
being
a
favorite
ipa
i
guess
i
was
hoping
for
a
bigger
brew
it
is
very
smooth
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
the
hops
are
not
a
real
kick
in
the
pants
i
enjoy
a
good
lashing
of
hops
but
with
this
beer
it
is
just
not
necessary
they
blend
in
very
well
with
a
smooth
rich
flavor
caramel
and
grain
the
aftertaste
brings
the
hops
back
and
is
just
a
delite
i
do
not
think
i
will
ever
go
wrong
with
samuel
smith
this
is
certainly
not
the
best
ipa
i
have
had
but
it
is
clearly
what
i
had
expected
out
of
the
tadcaster
brewery
their
own
unique
interpretation
of
the
style
seems
like
this
is
what
a
true
ipa
should
taste
like
although
i
still
love
the
american
inerpretation
of
the
style
great
brew
taste
you
go
thru
stages
with
this
beer
malty
sweet
and
bitter
in
good
balance
as
you
take
a
drink
as
you
swallow
the
sweet
leaves
and
only
the
bitter
remains
a
long
long
finish
plenty
o
hops
yummy
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
deep
copper
or
mahogany
if
you
prefer
head
is
bunyanesque
with
a
frothy
texture
and
light
tan
in

as
it
dematerializes
it
leaves
behind
a
thick
and
clinging
lace
upon
the
glass
the
aroma
of
sweet
ripe
apples
a
hint
of
the
hop
flowers
and
a
nice
malt

to
cap
off
this
exquisite
nose
the
start
is
malt
and
quite
sweet
the

in
its

to
the

the

not

the

brewery
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
what
quality
beer
they
produce
pours
out
to
a
dark
golden
amber
with
a
slight
head
nose
is
hops
and
malt
which
is
rather
unique
to
get
that
malt
profilearoma
from
an
ipa
taste
is
that
of
a
wonderfully
balanced
beer
yes
there
are
hops
here
as
there
should
be
with
an
ipa
but
the
malt
presence
is
undeniable
and
delicious
a
true
session
ipa
if
there
ever
was
one
nearly
clear
amber
gold
appearance
with
bulky
head
of
offwhite
foam
hoppy
crispness
comes
through
in
the
nose
but
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
weaker
than
expected
what
meets
expectations
is
the
hoppedup
tastesomewhat
dry
and
even
a
bit
sweet
flavors
are
quite
uniform
and
balanced
throughout
lingers
in
the
mouth
a
bit
but
drinkability
is
quite
strong
nice
orange
copper
color
offwhite
head
spicy
hops
and
sweet
malt
nose
spicy
hops
flavor
with
subdued
sweet
malt
in
the
background
the
hops
are
quite
nice
throughout
the
drink
however
the
hops
are
not
as
pungent
as
expected
in
an
ipa
overall
this
is
a
well
balanced
easy
to
drink
satisfying
ipa
with
good
flavor
pours
a
glowing
copper
hue
with
a
frothy
sticky
offwhite
head
which
retains
fairly
well
steady
carbonation
is
present
aroma
is
diverse
with
notes
of
spicy
hops
and
sweet
caramel
malt
taste
is
very
well
balanced
with
the
hops
and
malt
complementing
each
other
quite
well
although
the
hop
flavor
is
dominant
this
could
probably
use
some
more
hops
regardless
its
still
pretty
solid
mouthfeel
is
just
a
touch
carbonated
and
very
smooth
quite
refreshing
and
drinkable
this
is
a
classy
british
ipa
light
copper
in
color
with
a
small
head
that
didnt
last
the
smell
isnt
very
powerful
light
and
refreshing
and
very
well
balanced
not
much
like
the
ipas
of
today
but
still
tasty
i
have
only
had
a
couple
sam
smiths
beer
and
have
beer
very
impressed
each
time
id
drink
it
again
very
enjoyable
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
like
that
of
other
samuel
smith
ales
with
just
a
hint
of
bitter
spice
the
flavor
is
of
mellow
malt
with
grassy
undertones
and
an
unaggressive
bitterness
not
nearly
as
hoppy
as
i
had
hoped
for
but
very
drinkable
this
would
be
a
good
way
to
introduce
a
tentative
realbeer
drinker
to
the
world
of
hop
flavors
not
aggressive
but
not
absent
either
the
color
of
vernors
aromas
are
a
mixture
of
butterscotch
lemon
zest
and
brine
creamy
rich
texture
supports
flavors
of
seasoned
oak
caramel
fried
nuts
fig
seeds
and
twiggy
hops
like
most
other
old
brewery
tadcaster
products
this
is
a
cerebral
beer
close
your
eyes
drink
it
warm
turn
the
tv
off
and
contemplate
dont
fight
the
images
of
fish
n
chips
vendors
hussies
and
waifs
running
through
the
streets
of

full
rich

with

power
very
nice
hops
aroma
full
hops
in
the
taste
with
some
mellow
caramel
malt
taste
to
balance
out
the
hops
fairly
low
in
alcohol
for
an
ipa
but
with
a
very
classic
ipa
taste
a
very
nice
introduction
to
ipa
and
i
thought
a
very
agreeable
beer
not
bad
pours
a
clear
amberorange
color
with
a
3
finger
off
white
head
it
leaves
a
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
it
smells
slightly
sweet
and
tangy
the
taste
is
initially
hop
bitterness
with
just
a
slight
bit
of
caramel
flavoring
and
finishing
with
a
dry
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
that
is
stronger
than
at
the
beginning
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
goes
down
rather
nicely
i
could
definitely
drink
more
than
one
of
these
cheers
another
fine
brew
from
old
brewery
tadcaster
pours
light
amber
with
a
fluffy
head
that
trails
down
the
entire
glass
smell
is
dominated
by
hops
as
an
ipa
should
be
taste
is
also
predominatley
hoppy
with
some
carmel
or
butterscotch
malt
notes
i
found
this
ipa
to
be
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
another
samuel
smith
and
i
certainly
was
not
disappointed
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
nice
thick
fluffy
white
head
sticks
all
the
way
down
very
flavorful
and
slightly
sweet
but
not
much
hop
flavor
extremely
smooth
another
delicious
india
ale
and
yet
another
kickass
samuel
smith
brew
okay
as
usual
the
samuel
smiths
are
great
good
or
at
least
descent
this
beer
poured
a
cooper
gold
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
left
little
lace
the
aroma
was
of
hops
malt
and
caramel
the
taste
was
of
hops
malt
caramel
and
butterscotch
the
finish
was
of
hops
and
caramel
but
slightly
bitter
a
good
beer
but
i
think
i
prefer
my
ipaspersonallyto
be
a
little
less
sweet
nice
orange
color
poured
with
a
lovely
head
this
was
a
great
postgolf
picnic
ale
lighter
than
my
usual
ale
choice
with
enough
hops
to
draw
me
in
for
more
it
must
have
been
the
day
drinking
down
into
this
it
became
more
citrusy
less
bitter
lower
in
alcohol
too
a
definite
keeper
smooth
this
i
p
is
just
that
no
long
lasting
bitter
mouthfeel
but
a
very
easy
drink

slight

through
the

and
slight

a
lower
abv
at
5
0
but
still
hopped
and
malted
enough
to
taiste
makes
this
a
gentlemens
ipa
i
was
impressed
im
going
to
start
by
saying
this
beer
would
have
received
a
upper
echelon
rating
but
it
wasnt
a
fresh
bottle
it
had
the
similar
cardboard
taste
that
i
recognized
in
a
bottle
of
youngs
ram
rod
that
was
past
its
best
before
date
this
beer
looked
very
nice
a
clear
amber
with
a
thin
head
that
left
very
little
lace
i
guess
that
was
the
first
clue
the
aroma
was
just
a
tad
off
and
the
taste
was
a
bit
old
my
drinkability
rating
comes
from
the
fact
that
i
remember
this
beer
being
so
great
it
went
down
pretty
nicely
despite
being
off
so
i
know
it
would
be
better
im
going
to
buy
another
bottle
from
a
different
location
and
rereview
got
this
one
on
a
whim
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
hoppy
malty
satisfying
ale
big
creamy
head
and
decent
lacing
although
a
little
on
the
weak
side
clearish
amber
color
good
14
inch
head
that
sticks
to
itself
well
hoppy
aroma
flavorful
caramelly
malts
and
pretty
nice
floral
hop
assertion
slightly
hoppier
than
fullers
malts
not
quite
as
flavorful
nice
balance
and
extremely
drinkable
reserved
in
the
english
style
nice
bittering
at
the
swallow
but
subtle
a
very
polite
ipa
a
somewhat
mellow
tan
color
with
a
billowing
rocky
head
the
beer
has
a
shy
flirting
hop
aroma
the
first
time
i
had
this
brew
i
expected
a
powerful
facefull
of
hops
aroma
that
just
isnt
there
nice
solid
taste
however
pleasing
bitterness
worth
having
every
now
and
again
huge
creamy
billowy
well
retained
head
copper
hued
w
excellent
clarity
it
almost
looks
filtered
semi
pungent
floral
and
grassy
kent
goldings
nose
it
must
be
dry
hopped
yeast
fruitiness
although
perceptible
is
masked
by
the
relatively
strong
hop
nose
its
clean
and
well
balanced
in
taste
the
hop
bitterness
is
moderate
for
an
ipa
but
since
the
malt
profile
is
not
the
centerstage
of
this
brew
the
hops
dominate
certainly
a
clean
and
drinkable
brew
i
used
to
dislike
sams
india
ale
before
i
acquired
a
taste
for
british
hops
if
youre
not
used
to
a
rustic
grassy
earthy
hop
flavor
you
wont
like
this
brew
stylistically
speaking
its
weak
for
an
ipa
but
it
tastes
like
a
good
english
pale
well
really
not
what
i
expected
but
still
a
good
laid
back
ipa
starts
by
pouring
a
bronze
hazy
color
offwhite
light
tan
foamy
head
that
lasts
for
a
long
while
there
is
a
very
nice
floral
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
a
pretty
good
for
a
ipa
a
little
shortage
of
hops
but
not
all
that
bad
very
light
citrus
notes
a
very
nice
smooth
creamy
mouth
feel
and
dry
middle
with
a
long
clean
finish
i
had
to
get
to
the
middle
of
this
one
to
really
enjoy
it
overall
enjoyable
and
worth
a
try
pretty
good
stuff
but
then
again
there
are
many
other
great
ipas
out
there
hazy
copperorange
color
nice
chunky
head
i
liked
the
aroma
for
an
ipa
sweet
breadlike
malt
and
floraly
hops
unlike
most
american
ipas
the
initial
taste
impression
is
a
sweet
fruity
maltiness
but
finishes
nice
and
bitter
drank
a
lot
bigger
than
its
advertised
5
abv
a
nice
changeup
ipa
notes
a
decent
ale
though
small
in
comparison
to
other
modern
day
ipas
both
british
and
especially
american
oddly
enough
this
brew
is
not
any
bit
stronger
than
the
pale
ale
in
alcohol
the
body
and
hops
are
only
a
notch
higher
in
comparison
not
a
bad
ale
at
least
the
english
characteristics
make
this
brew
an
interesting
ale
a
classic
sharp
hops
with
just
enough
bite
overall
a
decent
take
on
an
ipa
nice
citrus
and
grassy
hop
notes
nothing
great
but
a
nice
lighter
take
on
the
style
6
months
past
exp
date
so
i
will
not
do
a
thorough
review
i
remember
it
tasting
a
bit
better
previously
very
good
example
of
the
english
ipa
style
the
english
malt
is
not
too
strong
and
the
hops
are
not
overwhelming
and
little
bite
a
serviceable
ipa
a
vaguely
fruity
note
in
there
but
it
works
otherwise
well
balanced
mild
but
discernible
hop
bite
on
the
finish
had
at
roccos
cisco
likes
clear
maize
color
poured
fresh
11415
bo
bottle
from
wegmans
into
pint
glass
and
produced
two
fingers
of
foam
citrus
notes
in
the
smell
very
balanced
malt
and
hop
profile
which
matches
the
advertised
english
ipa
style
overall
a
great
representative
of
the
style
will
seek
out
and
purchase
again
overall
ive
always
enjoyed
english
style
ipas
but
this
still
surprised
me
how
good
it
is
its
very
approachable
for
an
ipa
and
is
definitely
a
good
starter
beer
for
people
just
getting
into
craft
beers
but
it
also
would
easily
be
appreciated
by
passionate
and
seasoned
beer
drinkers
i
am
the
latter
cheers
if
one
puts
aside
any
ab
bias
this
is
a
solid
ipa
if
youre
wanting
an
english
ipa
with
balance
the
best
beer
at
my
softball
night
bar
not
much
to
choose
from
the
aroma
had
me
a
bit
worried
but
this
is
a
good
tasting
ipa
perhaps
a
breakthrough
ipa
for
people
getting
into
the
style
not
bad
dont
pass
it
up
overall
4
a
solid
b
beer
this
is
an
enjoyable
ipa
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
an
easy
drinking
pretty
sessionable
ipa
this
would
be
a
solid
choice
not
my
favorite
ipa
smelled
more
like
a
sour
than
an
ipa
flavor
was
not
there
at
all
for
whatever
reason
i
bought
a
six
pack
with
no
high
expectations
this
ipa
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
solid
white
head
extremely
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
lots
of
floral
pine
and
grapefruit
taste
going
on
beautiful
ipa
thats
not
overwhelming
hoppy
and
bitter
this
is
my
new
go
to
ipa
when
you
plan
on
having
more
than
a
couple
lol
some
reviews
the
bloke
who
said
way
too
much
hops
for
me
is
actually

indescribable
at
times
amazing
looks

has
a
clean
taste
its
ok
nothing
spectacular
one
of
my
go
to
ipas
always
good
to
have
around
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
smell
of
citrus
i
personally
love
it
when
poured
it
pours
a
fluffy
white
head
and
is
kind
of
a
orangeamber
color
at
first
i
was
a
little
apprehensive
because

very
light

body

outfoxsep
15
but
the
recipe
is
uniquely
spiced
and
quite
balanced
outdoorbrewer
notes
overall
this
moderate
to
mediumbodied
brew
is
one
of
the
most
balanced
american
takes
on
the
english
ipa
style
flavors
are
complex
yet
subtle
enough
that
they
dont
scar
the
palate
quite
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
one
is
a
winner
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
served
in
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
glass
for
some
reason
i
feel
that
there
is
something
missing
in
the
finish
of
this
beer
but
i
could
not
tell
you
what
overall
a
very
decent
and
nice
ipa
also
i
can
say
im
glad
the
woman
doesnt
read
these
reviews
very
nice
the
blend
of
malt
and
hoppy
flavours
is
excellent
the
hops
distinguish
themselves
but
are
restrained
by
american
standards
with
an
interesting
spicy
quality
very
drinkable
and
great
on
a
hot
day
recommended
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
the
bready
malts
are
not
too
apparent
like
in
some
other
english
ipas
and
the
strong
citrus
flavors
give
this
beer
a
unique
twist
on
the
style
overall
the
flavors
and
craft
of
this
brew
are
good
and
the
balance
between
hops
and
malts
is
fair
enough
to
allow
both
flavors
to
play
on
the
tongue
however
i
found
myself
wanting
something
extra
from
this
beer
as
the
flavors
while
good
are
fairly
standard
for
an
ipa
and
thus
theres
little
in
here
to
set
this
brew
apart
from
many
of
its
peers
a
rather
accented
ipa
hop
quality
nose
of
a
good
grain
base
and
honey
undertones
to
pine
there
is
a
subtle
tropical
fruit
citrus
very
subtle
but
it
gives
way
to
a
somewhat
smaller
batch
feel
and
more
concentration
on
the
hopping
palate
of
pine
sap
hints
of
mango
with
a
dominate
orange
skin
astringent
mineral
note
pretty
consistent
and
easy
to
drink
o
a
wellbalanced
highly
drinkable
english
style
ipa
this
was
a
nice
diversion
from
many
of
the
hop
bombs
that
i
have
been
drinking
lately
this
offering
could
easily
fall
into
the
session
beer
category
osomething
i
could
drink
regularly
very
potent
and
great
flavor
if
youre
looking
for
a
citrusy
dank
american
ipa
this
isnt
it
but
as
an
english
ipa
its
a
real
good
one
lots
of
englishstyle
hop
flavors
and
an
easy
one
to
drink
o
a
very
solid
ipa
and
one
i
would
have
again
12
oz
into
a
snifter
bright
body
but
not
nearly
so
bright
as
some
of
the
top
west
coast
ipas
decent
head
aroma
has
a
good
hoppy
character
but
not
super
intense
taste
has
a
good
bitterness
but
not
a
tone
of
malt
backbone
and
its
not
nearly
as
hoppy
as
the
standardbearers
of
this
style
fairly
smooth
though
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
nothing
objectionable
here
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
midwest
ipas
but
thats
not
saying
its
in
the
top
5
of
that
category
and
not
in
the
top
20
us
ipas
either
or
english
for
that
matter
since
this
is
described
as
an
english
style
ipa
although
the
hop
profile
resembles
many
us
ipas
usually
a
decent
value
here
in
chi
though
like
23
the
price
of
many
others
so
its
recommended
goose
island
india
pale
ale
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
orange
theres
initially
about
a
finger
of
dirty
white
foam
sitting
atop
the
beer
but
it
doesnt
show
much
either
in
the
way
of
retention
or
lacing
the
nose
is
classic
grapefruit
citrusy
with
a
solid
background
note
of
orange
all
in
all
it
lacks
a
little
punch
though
theres
a
brief
bit
of
bready
malt
at
the
open
of
each
sip
before
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
rolls
through
mid
palate
the
close
features
the
anticipated
grapefruit
and
orange
notes
but
theres
also
something
else
a
slightly
unpleasant
aftertaste
that
at
first
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
it
was
only
in
reading
some
other
reviews
after
the
fact
that
i
was
able
to
hit
on
what
it
was
and
that
was
a
bizarre
soapy
note
to
the
finish
the
body
provides
a
solid
frame
for
the
beer
yet
remains
relatively
light
that
combined
with
a
nice
lively
amount
of
carbonation
results
in
a
fairly
spot
on
mouthfeel
for
an
ipa
goose
island
india
pale
ale
comes
off
as
a
beer
that
pairs
american
hops
with
an
english
sensibility
as
far
as
hopping
rates
that
makes
the
beer
an
american
ipa
in
my
book
despite
how
its
listed
here
and
one
that
just
doesnt
have
the
requisite
punch
to
it
still
a
fairly
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
though
edit
ok
had
this
one
again
a
year
later
and
liked
it
a
whole
lot
more
on
draught
appreciate
the
well
balanced
english
aspect
of
this
beer
when
first
reviewed
caught
up
in
american
hopbomb
ipa
craze
and
less
able
to
appreciate
this
beers
lovely
balance
between
hops
and
malt
and
the
earthier
herbs
and
grass
hop
character
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
particularly
lovely
on
tap
the
alcohol
is
here
but
can
barely
be
felt
while
i
like
an
english
take
on
a
style
thats
pretty
popular
here
in
the
states
this
left
a
bit
to
be
desired
goose
island
has
such
popular
beers
and
one
has
to
wonder
if
the
takeover
by
busch
has
compromised
the
consistency
of
the
product
or
not
for
those
looking
for
a
mellow
take
on
a
strong
style
this
would
be
a
great
choice
as
for
me
im
willing
to
give
it
another
go
on
tap
to
see
of
the
discrepancy
between
that
and
the
bottled
form
is
still
present
or
not
the
beer
is
good
its
not
great
you
dont
expect
it
to
be
great
its
just
good
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
and
again
that
and
i
love
goose
island
just
the
name
the
logo
and
the
atmosphere
i
get
when
there
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
because
the
taste
is
very
balanced
the
relatively
low
alcohol
content
makes
rather
sessionable
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
will
be
getting
again
easy
to
drink
and
great
for
a
hot
day
would
definitely
like
to
try
it
when
it
fresher
o
as
my
first
taste
of
any
goose
island
stuff
had
in
bars
before
but
never
bottle
this
is
a
good
one
its
a
really
mild
and
easy
drinking
ipa
offering
i
would
definitely
drink
again
but
not
a
favorite
good
summer
ipa
for
the
heat
im
not
sure
if
its
the
fact
that
this
is
an
english
ipa
or
what
but
im
just
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
i
had
high
hopes
for
goose
island
and
so
far
i
dont
like
their
ipa
or
312
urban
wheat
to
me
this
ipa
seems
to
be
a
bit
too
full
and
not
bright
enough
for
me
again
it
could
be
the
style
i
dont
know
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
ipa
but
it
wasnt
bad
o
not
as
unforgettable
as
the
packaging
would
suggest
but
not
bad
pleasing
summer
ipa
that
brings
crisp
fruitiness
to
the
fold
ive
had
better
from
goose
island
and
come
to
expect
more
o
not
a
go
to
beer
for
me
but
a
solid
brew
its
well
balanced
and
highly
approachable
it
would
be
great
for
those
just
getting
into
the
style
not
really
english
but
the
prototypical
american
ipa
i
wouldnt
know
theres
styrian
golding
and
fuggles
in
there
since
the
cascade
and
especially
dry
centennial
take
over
most
brewpubs
breweries
do
something
similar
these
days
but
its
interesting
to
see
how
it
was
back
in
93
simple
and
reliable
i
hope
bud
dont
change
it
o
overall
pretty
good
on
its
own
or
as
a
session
with
the
5
9
abv
not
being
too
heavy
another
one
of
the
varieties
in
my
beerkraft
order
really
surprised
by
this
had
no
idea
something
worthwhile
could
come
out
of
chicago
other
than
a
navy
recruit
right
from
popping
the
top
i
knew
i
was
in
for
a
treat
the
piney
aroma
oozed
forth
and
pushed
itself
upon
my
nostrils
thrusting
its
hoppy
splendor
against
the
wall
of
my
senses
pours
a
medium
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
and
the
lacing
starts
almost
immediately
it
smells
like
a
herb
garden
with
the
piney
penetrating
me
easily
it
tastes
wonderful
light
hoppy
citrusy
with
some
fruitfloral
qualities
mouthfeel
is
splendid
i
could
only
hope
for
a
splendid
beer
like
this
to
assault
my
senses
on
a
regular
basis
nice
sessionable
beer
and
overall
a
great
american
ipa
not
from
the
west
coast
cheers
pours
a
nice
dark
orange
color
white
bubbly
head
decent
carbonation
streaming
from
the
bottom
the
smell
is
floral
citrus
malty
overall
a
very
well
balanced
ipa
aroma
nothing
overpowers
the
other
aromas
which
i
like
the
taste
is
great
starts
off
bitter
then
smooths
out
to
citrus
and
the
malts
medium
body
overall
this
ipa
is
very
well
balanced
and
i
like
it
a
lot
another
great
offering
from
goose
island
overall
a
good
solid
ipa
i
enjoyed
it
wouldnt
mind
picking
up
some
more
in
the
future
poured
a
cloudy
strawyellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
receded
rather
quickly
piney
hops
in
the
nose
similarly
piney
hops
in
the
taste
with
a
citrus
bite
and
some
smooth
earthy
hops
in
the
background
for
a
pretty
decent
balance
not
overly
bitter
or
hoppy
but
a
slightly
sweet
finish
from
the
malts
medium
mouthfeel
a
moderately
drinkable
selection
i
am
starting
to
realize
that
i
do
not
like
the
everyday
goose
island
lineup
lemon
zest
hops
strike
me
right
away
sort
of
like
dawn
dish
detergent
its
so
powerful
either
this
is
a
bad
one
or
i
am
not
the
norm
who
likes
this
beer
d
easily
drinkable
and
what
you
expect
from
an
ipa
but
it
doesnt
really
pass
that
by
much
after
having
mine
i
thought
that
it
may
have
faded
a
bit
but
after
seeing
several
other
reviews
it
doesnt
seem
like
it
would
have
been
very
potent
fresh
either
o
pleasant
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
down
the
road
and
compare
to
my
notes
today
i
hope
nothing
is
tampered
with
the
recipe
this
was
generally
a
wonderful
ipa
highly
drinkable
the
stickyness
of
this
ipa
is
wonderful
also
a
creeper
at
5
9
if
your
not
careful
this
one
could
sneak
up
on
you
oone
of
the
more
earthy
beers
ive
had
sn
estate
and
stone
ipa
come
to
mind
as
others
not
the
sweetest
version
but
earthy
and
a
good
example
of
an
earthy
ipa
dont
ruin
this
on
inbev
bottle
no
date
on
this
one
that
i
could
find
poured
into
a
new
belgium
tulip
style
glass
a
clear
honey
golden
color
with
a
slight
off
white
head
that
has
a
pretty
poor
retention
the
head
does
collar
slightly
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
slightly
skunky
citrus
note
that
like
over
ripe
grapefruit
and
orange
medium
mouthfeel
muted
citrus
flavors
with
a
slight
sweetness
rather
bland
in
flavor
to
be
honest
with
a
minimal
hop
presence
even
in
the
back
end
there
is
minimal
flavors
overall
this
is
a
subpar
apa
that
i
would
not
consider
buying
anytime
soon
d
pretty
nice
this
is
not
an
over
the
top
ipa
but
it
is
an
easily
quaffable
beer
and
quite
sessionable
by
american
standards
the
hop
aroma
is
quite
nice
and
while
it
pokes
through
the
malt
in
the
flavor
profile
it
is
a
bit
more
subdued
than
i
would
like
the
malt
manages
to
be
thick
and
bready
without
becoming
overwhelming
and
it
finishes
just
dry
enough
to
keep
the
beer
drinkable
o
a
nicely
balanced
fruity
juicy
beer
fine
session
beer
very
restrained
and
balanced
kind
of
neutral
on
this
one
its
good
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
similar
to
our
typical
regional
brews
for
me
o
solid
ipa
overall
not
the
best
ive
had
but
up
there
definitely
my
drink
of
choice
at
citi
field
overall
a
very
sessionable
and
wellbalanced
ipa
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
setting
without
getting
bored
try
it
this
was
one
of
a
sampler
12
pack
bought
in
belvedere
il
very
reasonable
priced
i
think
it
is
a
great
ipa
best
one
i
have
had
in
a
while
very
smooth
with
good
drink
ability
a
very
good
mix
of
bittering
and
aroma
hops
great
job
d
a
nicely
balanced
brew
good
blend
of
hops
with
the
dry
sense
and
a
slight
sweetness
o
nothing
special
here
fairly
light
overall
drink
overall
this
is
my
1st
regular
lineup
beer
from
gi
a
nice
beer
malty
sweet
paired
with
a
chicago
style
hot
dog
and
a
dipped
italian
beef
sandwich
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
it
has
nice
flavor
it
has
a
little
more
malty
sweetness
than
i
usually
like
but
it
is
a
very
nice
ipa
none
the
less
i
would
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
o
refreshing
beer
that
can
be
drunk
by
the
sixpack
without
getting
bored
of
the
taste
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
india
pale
ale
beers
like
goose
island
ipa
and
magic
hat
blind
faith
make
me
wish
more
american
breweries
would
attempt
to
overamericanize
the
english
ipa
style
because
the
results
are
great
goose
island
ipa
isnt
mindblowing
but
it
is
really
good
d
i
dont
have
a
lot
to
say
about
goose
island
ipa
but
i
would
drink
again
and
again
recommended
for
a
solid
allrounder
it
might
not
be
winning
any
awards
wait
whats
that
it
did
three
silvers
a
bronze
and
a
gold
in
the
great
american
beer
festival
and
a
2010
gold
in
the
world
beer
cup
but
its
a
great
beer
nonetheless
i
poured
this
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
cloudy
pale
golden
color
it
produced
a
think
3
12
finger
think
white
foamy
head
excellent
head
retention
and
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
is
is
very
much
dominated
by
malt
and
bitter
hops
slight
notes
of
citrus
the
taste
is
malty
piney
and
hops
spring
out
in
the
front
and
during
the
finish
the
finish
is
a
bit
dry
with
an
almost
oily
taste
the
beer
is
very
smooth
overall
a
very
good
ipa
a
highly
drinkable
beer
that
also
has
a
nice
flavor
could
easily
be
a
staple
beer
for
those
that
like
ipas
but
dont
want
anything
that
leaves
a
strong
after
taste
overall
a
really
solid
ipa
all
around
this
is
a
nice
break
from
the
hop
bombs
and
palatewreckers
that
everyone
is
obsessed
with
brewing
its
an
unpretentious
nofrills
damned
drinkable
ipa
d
a
sound
ipa
all
around
balanced
enough
but
definitely
hopcentric
the
6
pack
wont
last
long
which
i
say
is
testament
enough
taste
is
more
than
medium
bodied
one
of
the
more
thick
ipas
ive
ever
tasted
some
good
bitterness
but
doesnt
really
smack
you
in
the
mouth
with
hops
pretty
well
balanced
tasty
but
not
overpowering
not
the
most
spectacular
ipa
ive
had
but
definitely
above
average
and
very
drinkable
d
my
new
favorite
ipa
its
one
of
the
best
i
mean
the
alstöm
gave
it
a
solid
b
like
most
craft
beers
6
pack
is
blenty
d
very
drinkable
maybe
not
the
best
but
certainly
not
the
most
ridiculously
flamboyant
ipa
either
good
nice
ipa
on
draught
at
the
long
gong
tailgators
in
clinton
ma
i
think
the
best
they
had
on
tap
very
nice
on
the
nose
and
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
depending
on
which
bartender
was
working
would
lat
you
know
how
good
a
pour
you
would
get
its
a
shame
the
gator
is
gone
a
great
bar
to
sit
at
and
have
a
coupla
brews
overall
grade
cc
drinkability
slightly
high
abv
is
well
masked
by
flavors
the
general
wellroundedness
of
this
brew
make
me
want
to
come
back
to
it
again
and
again
maybe
this
isnt
the
ipa
for
hopheads
but
its
a
very
good
beer
all
around
and
is
a
good
introduction
to
the
ipa
style
whether
youre
a
fan
of
ipa
style
beers
or
not
this
is
worth
a
try
drinkable
enjoyable
and
easy
to
find
i
could
drink
this
with
no
problem
through
a
session
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
definitely
not
light
nor
watery
this
is
a
delicious
ipa
d
just
ok
flavor
and
body
d
drinkable
just
notthing
special
d
not
what
im
really
accustomed
to
with
the
american
ipa
being
my
weapon
of
choice
for
the
broader
style
not
awful
though
drinkability
the
more
i
consumed
of
this
beer
the
more
i
enjoyed
it
there
is
so
much
to
love
subtle
and
wellrounded
both
quenching
and
engaging
plus
the
mouthfeel
is
impeccable
i
feel
foolish
for
not
having
tried
this
sooner
this
is
a
beer
even
your
coronadrinking
dad
can
rally
round
m
and
d
thin
body
moderate
carbonation
nice
balancing
act
of
resin
and
dryness
on
the
palate
very
easy
to
drink
one
of
my
goto
session
beers
very
good
brew
very
smooth
and
drinkable
but
lacked
a
little
in
the
flavor
department
for
me
there
are
better
ipas
out
there
though
the
plus
of
this
one
is
that
its
a
bit
closer
to
sessionable
than
some
others
good
beer
goose
island
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
1
finger
of
sticky
tight
white
head
good
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
citrus
hops
grapefruit
lemon
and
a
pretty
strong
maltiness
taste
is
of
crisp
citrus
hop
bitterness
grapefruit
and
dry
malt
nice
medium
mouthfeel
served
at
a
perfect
temp
creamy
and
very
solid
drinks
very
well
solid
ipa
would
gladly
revisit
this
ale
was
bottled
dec
2010
by
the
way
d
not
too
heavy
and
the
tastes
are
unique
but
not
tiresome
i
could
see
myself
going
through
a
few
of
these
out
of
a
bottle
this
brew
was
a
cloudy
lightapricot
color
with
one
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
retention
was
decent
as
a
small
collar
and
it
left
consistent
spots
the
aroma
was
of
spicy
noble
hops
grapefruit
zest
hoppy
resins
and
light
mustiness
the
flavors
were
onpoint
it
was
full
and
inviting
with
an
enjoyable
lingering
finish
the
flavors
were
built
around
a
crystal
malt
backbone
augmented
by
some
caramelcaramunich
malt
the
hop
profile
was
juicy
rich
spicy
and
noblehopheavy
not
as
musty
as
the
aroma
and
pleasantly
so
the
mouthfeel
was
quite
good
the
body
medfull
and
the
carbonation
appropriate
drinkability
overall
a
good
beer
didnt
find
the
pine
flavour
too
dominant
as
in
other
ipas
would
stock
for
future
tastings
and
sharing
overall
a
decent
ipa
especially
for
those
who
arent
huge
fans
of
ipas
in
general
hopheads
will
be
left
looking
for
more
which
is
the
boat
im
in
did
not
know
i
was
getting
an
english
ipa
from
an
american
brewery
a
good
beer
to
experience
nonetheless
the
color
is
typical
of
an
ipa
goldenstraw
very
clear
with
a
bright
amount
of
good
carbonation
aroma
is
quite
hoppy
with
both
citrus
and
pine
notes
the
flavor
has
great
bitterness
but
you
can
also
taste
the
floweriness
of
the
flavoring
hops
overallthis
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
in
a
category
that
i
find
to
also
be
the
most
drinkable
im
glad
to
see
that
its
as
available
in
new
york
as
it
is
a
little
crisp
up
front
and
a
little
leathery
in
the
middle
finishes
dry
and
leaves
my
mouth
wanting
more
not
too
bad
of
the
english
ipa
style
drinkability
decently
drinkable
but
not
very
sought
after
by
my
taste
buds
another
goose
island
beer
that
surprised
me
very
solid
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
someone
who
hasnt
had
experience
with
ipas
easy
to
find
solid
cost
efficient
beer
mouthfeel
was
alright
perhaps
a
little
more
carbonated
than
an
ipa
should
be
drinkability
is
good
goose
island
ipa
is
a
solid
but
unspectacular
representation
of
the
style
on
a
business
trip
to
southern
minnesota
i
was
able
to
get
a
6
pack
of
goose
island
ipa
to
get
me
through
the
week
with
no
fridge
in
my
hotel
room
i
had
to
put
a
goose
island
on
ice
before
dinner
to
have
a
cold
brew
to
end
the
day
the
days
ended
well
with
a
thick
head
and
inspiring
aroma
the
goose
island
looked
good
even
in
a
plastic
cup
flavorful
hops
stand
out
on
top
of
a
luxurious
malt
base
very
smooth
drinking
and
a
nice
finish
round
out
an
ipa
that
is
much
better
than
average
recommended
if
you
like
ipas
beer
pours
out
a
slightly
hazy
orangish
yellow
color
with
some
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
actually
quite
present
i
was
under
the
impression
that
they
brew
mostly
with
pelletized
hops
but
fortunately
this
beer
has
some
nice
citric
whiffs
that
pop
and
some
slightly
candy
smells
that
reminds
me
of
fff
weird
anyway
i
think
this
beer
has
changed
over
the
years
for
the
better
it
starts
off
quite
bitter
dry
and
hoppy
with
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
to
add
some
balance
very
citric
lemony
and
fruity
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
on
the
watery
side
what
do
you
expect
this
is
a
goose
island
beer
we
live
next
to
lake
michigan
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
i
feel
happy
to
have
some
in
my
stash
goose
ipa
pours
cloudy
yellow
with
1
12
fingers
of
head
that
hangs
around
to
the
end
the
nice
head
allows
for
a
bold
sour
citrus
smell
that
punches
you
in
the
nose
maybe
some
pineapple
or
grapefruit
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
very
bitter
up
front
not
dissimilar
to
a
grapefruit
with
a
lot
of
hop
presence
to
follow
this
is
a
good
ipa
but
i
think
i
like
the
smell
even
better
than
the
taste
not
as
a
criticism
to
the
taste
this
beer
is
also
very
crisp
and
refreshing
drawing
a
connection
to
the
honkers
this
is
definitely
very
bitter
rather
than
the
expected
sweet
it
just
depends
on
what
you
are
after
for
that
particular
session
id
have
another
and
another
my
partiality
usually
lies
with
american
ipa
varieties
im
bending
the
rules
here
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
on

poured
into

glass
at
goose
island
in
wrigleyville
summer
of
2009
pours
dark
gold
with
a
thick
white
frothy
head
aroma
is
herbal
hop
and
grapefruit
citrus
flavour
is
good
hop
bitterness
some
pale
malt
showing
through
and
a
bit
of
a
thinning
out
towards
the
finish
though
a
nice
lingering
dryish
bitterness
very
drinkable
if
these
ratings
were
based
on
value
they
would
be
a
lot
higher
i
got
these
for
less
than
1
40beer
and
i
have
spent
a
lot
more
for
beers
that
were
not
as
good
as
goose
island
india
pale
ale
drink
the
beer
seems
just
a
little
bit
unbalanced
but
it
still
very
tasty
there
are
more
malty
notes
than
fruity
ones
im
happy
i
tried
it
and
its
worth
seeking
out
overall
im
very
unimpressed
usually
goose
island
comes
out
with
more
quality
stuff
look
else
where
for
a
good
ipa
d
this
one
was
okay
to
me
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
get
it
again
the
hop
flavors
were
all
over
the
place
and
almost
too
bitter
not
very
well
balanced
in
my
honest
opinion
d
i
like
this
beer
but
i
usually
look
for
a
more
powerful
citrus
flavor
in
my
ipas
but
i
did
enjoy
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
the
md
of
this
brew
is
also
great
feels
full
and
nice
as
it
goes
down
i
like
the
way
goose
island
has
made
this
beer
to
be
so
drinkable
but
be
flavorful
d
a
very
mild
interpretation
of
the
style
but
solid
none
the
less
overall
another
great
brew
from
goose
island
an
ipa
done
the
way
it
should
be
done
ive
also
heard
that
goose
island
is
barack
obamas
favorite
for
what
its
worth
i
dont
wanna
turn
conservatives
off
haha
very
light
and
carbonated
the
bitterness
is
balanced
great
with
the
body
making
very
drinkable
d
not
at
all
surprised
that
this
beer
is
the
gold
standard
for
english
style
ipa
at
most
contests
fantastic
expressive
english
hop
characteristics
with
enough
balance
to
actually
pair
with
food
threw
some
slowroasted
pork
loin
with
cracked
pepper
at
it
earlier
worked
like
a
charm
this
is
a
beer
that
will
always
be
welcome
in
my
house
dm
smooth
on
the
pallet
great
taste
slight
carbonation
tingle
slight
driness
on
the
pallet
d
easy
going
sessionable
but
would
like
to
have
a
little
more
complexity
i
actually
missed
this
somehow
while
i
was
in
chicago
in
may
but
penn
station
in
new
york
to
the
rescue
nice
32
ounce
pour
for
like
6
or
something
at
the
pizza
place
near
the
long
island
railroad
pours
a
golden
orange
colour
with
a
finger
of
head
almost
no
lacing
but
really
nice
head
retention
smells
of
citrus
hops
with
a
very
bready
malt
medium
bitterness
level
for
an
ipa
quite
a
high
carbonation
which
could
be
toned
down
a
bit
to
make
the
mouthfeel
nicer
nice
beer
though
very
drinkable
ipa
i
will
definitely
be
stocking
up
on
more
of
this
brew
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
and
finally
got
my
chance
while
in
ny
for
the
holidays
pours
a
hazy
bright
goldenorange
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
average
sized
foamy
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
when
it
goes
scent
is
hoppy
with
a
nice
spicy
character
to
it
taste
is
floral
hops
with
some
honey
tones
and
a
nice
biscuit
malt
backbone
good
but
not
my
kind
of
ipa
not
a
bad
beer
but
couldnt
help
but
feel
a
bit
disappointed
thats
my
fault
thought
think
i
hyped
this
a
bit
too
much
in
my
head
the
taste
had
a
dry
finish
and
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
enough
to
give
it
that
distinct
ipa
feel
but
not
so
much
that
i
cant
drink
more
i
finished
a
6
pack
rather
quickly
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
i
look
forward
to
finishing
off
a
bunch
of
these
tonight
and
thats
what
this
brew
is
good
for
it
wont
insult
your
pallet
drinkability
a
good
ipa
very
well
balanced
though
it
does
seem
a
bit
hoppier
than
other
english
ipas
i
have
had
not
overly
so
however
a
solid
beer
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
again
d
big
fan
of
this
beer
i
could
see
myself
getting
this
one
again
many
times
over
quality
very
sessionable
too
and
surprisingly
cheap
d
33
5
even
though
i
like
a
balanced
ipa
this
one
is
too
far
tilted
toward
the
malt
and
desperately
needs
more
cones

a
clear
orange
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
aroma
of
citrus
rich

oils
tropical
fruits
grapefruit
and
melon
rind
flavor
of
plenty
of
citrusy

rich
caramel
malt
grassy
and
garlicky

very
tasty
superbly
drinkable
this
one
surprised
me
since
i
never
really
heard
anyone
mention
it
as
a
top
ipa
but
i
found
it
to
be
quite
good
do
this
goose
island
offering
would
do
wonders
on
a
summer
day
have
had
this
beer
many
times
in
the
past
few
years
i
believe
it
to
be
underrated
for
the
style
d
nice
drinking
ipa
the
hop
oils
keep
your
mouth
tasting
fresh
between
sips
and
after
finishing
a
glass
this
beer
is
much
better
when
extremely
fresh
i
really
noticed
the
lack
of
aroma
compared
to
gi
ipa
ive
had
in
the
past
allinall
a
good
ipa
but
lets
be
honest
its
pretty
average
nothing
really
seems
to
stand
put
about
it
however
thats
not
to
say
it
isnt
worthy
of
drinking
its
a
good
beer
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
overallnotes
its
pretty
obvious
that
its
an
english
ipa
a
much
maltier
character
than
its
american
counterparts
its
a
really
decent
beer
good
for
small
gatherings
and
whatnot
this
is
one
of
those
brews
that
you
dont
drink
because
you
want
the
endall
beall
of
beers
but
because
hey
you
like
it
nice
work
the
taste
starts
with
carbonation
on
the
tongue
a
sweet
pale
malt
enters
the
carbonation
fills
the
mouth
and
cuts
the
sweet
malt
to
show
a
earthy
hoppyness
it
is
pungent
but
finishes
with
a
smooth
bitterness
a
chicago
beer
from
a
chicago
glass
good
times
it
pours
a
lightly
hazed
golden
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
ruby
red
grapefruit
pine
and
some
nicely
sweet
caramel
the
taste
brings
more
of
the
same
though
the
caramel
is
lightened
a
bit
and
a
touch
of
mint
is
added
the
body
is
a
heftyish
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
velvety
feel
overall
a
very
nice
ipa
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
yet
had
from
gi
im
glad
i
saw
that
this
is
an
english
ipa
before
i
took
a
drink
or
else
id
have
been
seriously
concerned
that
it
wasnt
a
very
bitter
ipa
now
i
see
why
upfront
theres
a
decent
dose
of
pine
and
spicy
hops
that
hit
right
away
fading
into
some
bready
toasty
malt
that
finish
off
the
body
finishes
with
a
tight
snap
of
hops
with
a
faint
lingering
of
toasted
grain
afterwards
a
very
good
english
ipa
which
i
will
admit
i
typically
enjoy
more
than
american
ipas
d
friendly
beer
but
not
my
first
choice
however
it
kind
of
grows
on
you
d
sessionable
but
doesnt
stand
out
for
the
style
perhaps
gi
is
going
for
the
sessionable
route
here
thanks
but
ill
pass
d
i
may
return
to
this
beer
if
i
ever
find
myself
in
one
of
the
goose
island
brewpubs
but
i
wouldnt
choose
to
crack
open
a
2nd
one
right
now
if
i
had
other
options
pale
orange
with
a
bubbly
body
which
results
in
a
decent
sized
tan
head
which
doesnt
fade
as
much
as
it
sinks
in
the
middle
which
leaves
a
thick
and
short
lacing
behind
oily
hops
at
the
nose
initially
with
some
malt
some
orange
peel
and
very
faint
citrus
in
the
back
first
pull
reveals
a
very
smooth
drinking
ipa
with
a
pleasant
hit
of
citrus
and
light
fruits
followed
by
a
balancing
hop
bitterness
and
a
malty
somewhat
creamy
core
light
to
medium
bodied
and
crisp
when
all
is
said
and
done
not
a
hop
bomb
just
a
well
made
ipa
that
hits
the
spot
at
this
particular
moment
i
would
not
turn
one
down
if
a
host
offered
me
one
but
it
is
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
for
myself
and
keep
in
the
fridge
but
what
the
hell
do
i
know
interesting
flavor
worth
a
taste
as
a
note
this
beer
is
almost
4
months
old
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
coarse
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
but
not
too
much
the
aroma
is
good
but
not
great
i
blame
the
age
there
is
some
bitterness
to
it
but
it
seems
muddled
though
oddly
i
didnt
expect
to
taste
oak
yet
i
do
it
feels
good
to
me
on
the
palate
and
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
would
like
to
try
a
fresher
one
and
rereview
overall
this
is
a
good
ipa
what
throws
me
off
with
it
is
the
barley
finish
im
not
fond
of
when
my
ipa
takes
on
this
persona
id
recommend
this
to
the
ipa
drinkers
out
there
as
its
definitely
something
good
to
try
the
nose
flows
straight
into
the
taste
which
is
just
a
bit
hoppy
and
bitter
over
a
fairly
complex
malt
base
as
much
as
i
love
my
chops
occasionally
somethig
like
this
just
really
hits
the
spot
great
feel
and
drinkability
this
is
a
real
winner
d
good
solid
summer
beer
for
the
boldness
of
it
it
is
very
drinkable
well
hidden
abv
and
very
tasty
beer
good
example
of
an
eipa
all
in
all
this
is
definitely
a
solid
easily
accessible
session
beer
this
seems
like
it
would
be
great
to
sip
on
a
summer
afternoon
to
cool
down
your
taste
buds
worth
a
try
if
you
have
the
chance
and
like
ipas
drinkability
is
ok
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
guess
this
is
a
reasonable
enough
example
this
beer
pours
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
it
is
clear
light
golden
amber
the
smell
is
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
caramel
there
is
also
some
nice
floral
hops
kind
of
subdued
even
for
an
english
ipa
taste
is
mostly
malt
some
sweetness
and
nice
floral
hops
with
some
citrus
in
the
background
there
is
a
nice
bitterness
as
well
but
this
beer
is
very
balanced
mouthfeel
a
little
thick
i
would
like
it
a
bit
drier
but
its
good
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
two
inches
of
off
white
head
this
brew
is
gold
in
color
the
aroma
is
mild
citrus
hops
the
taste
begins
citrusy
and
finishes
with
a
dull
bitter
taste
i
like
the
fact
that
this
is
mild
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
dont
get
bittered
out
after
a
few
ive
used
this
as
a
go
to
beer
before
as
the
beer
warmed
up
the
hops
tasted
fresher
i
definitely
shouldnt
have
opened
this
right
out
of
the
fridge
this
ipa
stands
out
as
a
great
lightbodied
session
beer
d
great
session
ipa
one
of
the
best
in
that
category
quite
easy
to
drink
d
very
drinkable
id
session
this
for
sure
d
a
solid
allaround
session
ipa
still
wish
i
had
tried
sofie
instead
as
this
is
solid
but
a
bit
unspectacular
dark
gold
with
an
impressive
head
and
lace
grapefruit
and
floral
hops
in
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
with
maybe
a
touch
of
pineapple
or
tropical
hop
juice
very
fresh
tasting
and
zesty
its
a
fullbodied
but
very
smooth
beernothing
outofthisworld
but
no
points
of
contention
a
great
beer
to
have
around
now
that
being
said
i
really
do
like
this
beer
the
hops
are
clear
and
crisp
allowing
for
a
good
drinkable
beer
i
just
would
like
to
see
a
more
clear
point
to
this
beer
and
a
direction
overall
fairly
forgettable
ive
liked
other
goose
island
beers
but
i
really
didnt
care
for
this
one
very
much
i
wouldnt
bother
if
theres
something
else
on
tap
d
not
bad
ipas
arent
my
favorite
style
and
this
isnt
an
asskicking
example
of
either
the
top
american
or
english
styles
but
its
certainly
palatable
and
in
the
dollarabottle
range
im
happy
to
put
one
back
i
like
the
more
toned
down
examples
of
ipas
frankly
but
this
isnt
as
good
as
their
green
line
which
i
wish
theyd
bottle
on
tap
at
the
big
e
in
the
shock
top
booth
yeah
i
was
as
confused
as
you
are
nice
above
average
ipa
that
fresh
hoppy
citrus
kick
to
it
nothing
blowing
my
mind
here
but
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
on
tap
my
first
beer
from
the
brewery
and
i
am
impressed
still
have
to
try
the
08
and
09
bourbon
country
stouts
and
the
bcbcs
in
my
beer
fridge
d
very
drinkable
great
session
hoppy
ipa
shame
about
the
malt
i
certainly
enjoy
other
ipas
more
but
from
a
rating
perspective
well
goose
island
has
just
done
an
amazing
job
making
this
brew
d
totally
solid
example
of
the
style
pours
a
2
head
which
settles
down
to
lace
in
minutes
color
is
interesting
kind
of
bronze
yellow
almost
but
not
completely
clear
smell
and
taste
are
classic
ipa
and
it
delivers
enough
hops
for
hopheads
but
not
too
much
that
the
mere
mortals
cant
enjoy
it
in
fact
thats
the
only
drawback
ive
had
crisper
and
bolder
ipas
still
its
a
fine
brew
d
goes
down
very
well
without
being
slammed
by
a
wall
of
alcohol
not
bad
another
good
beer
from
goose
island
d
i
can
drink
this
pretty
much
anytime
i
want
a
beer
have
not
had
a
food
yet
i
dont
enjoy
it
with
cheap
very
spicy
tacos
seem
to
pair
the
best
undying
love
and
loyalty
to
this
as
well
as
goose
islands
honkers
ale
top
notch
drinkability
is
high
between
this
and
various
other
great
gi
beers
im
quite
happy
with
goose
island
and
always
plan
to
buy
more
of
their
beer
in
the
future
its
reasonably
priced
as
well
which
is
a
nice
perk
but
id
rate
the
drinkability
just
as
high
either
way
absolutely
notes
not
the
classic
one
would
expect
its
worth
the
try
and
worth
grabbing
at
a
bar
but
it
lacks
a
richer
hoppy
sense
that
makes
me
long
for
other
ipas
ahead
of
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
a
pretty
nice
hoppy
and
easy
drinking
beer
it
had
some
nice
hop
flavors
but
also
had
a
decent
malt
base
to
it
pretty
good
overall
ive
been
pretty
lucky
with
all
the
american
craft
beer
ipas
ive
tried
recently
and
this
one
was
no
different
a
nice
thick
rocky
head
was
maintained
by
a
surging
attack
of
thin
beading
quite
distinctive
with
a
juicy
slightly
sweetish
bitterness
which
gives
an
almost
gingery
peppery
quality
to
it
could
easily
get
goosed
on
this
if
i
had
more
quality
from
start
to
finish
and
to
think
that
this
is
just
a
middling
quality
ipa
among
other
a
host
of
other
more
seemingly
better
versions
drinkability
even
though
its
1230
am
on
a
wednesday
i
want
another
beer
although
i
cant
say
id
order
the
same
one
if
given
a
choice
if
nothing
else
looks
good
id
take
another
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
clean
white
persistent
head
pleasant
citrus
and
floral
aromas
carried
over
to
the
taste
which
was
primarily
bitter
hops
and
citrus
this
is
not
a
particularly
complex
ipa
and
one
that
definitely
falls
on
the
dry
side
of
the
spectrum
that
said
it
is
very
drinkable
and
given
the
reasonable
abv
one
that
is
a
nice
break
from
some
of
the
more
overwrought
beers
in
this
style
i
would
recommend
it
as
a
good
compromise
ipa
and
one
that
would
work
well
as
a
session
beer
pretty
easy
drinking
though
a
little
too
bitter
to
be
one
to
just
sit
there
and
pound
for
me
goose
island
is
an
ipa
that
is
not
overthetop
with
bitterness
an
easy
drinking
ipa
d
ehh
just
ok
fills
me
up
more
than
you
would
want
from
this
offering
wow
didnt
realize
how
long
i
have
been
enjoing
this
beer
until
i
noted
that
my
earlier
review
was
way
back
when
it
was
called
smooth
india
pale
ale
and
the
label
was
pinstriped
goose
island
ipa
is
readily
available
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
and
like
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
is
a
reliable
goto
beer
for
a
hopsfix
nothing
flashy
but
this
beer
hits
all
the
points
for
the
style
although
perhaps
a
touch
more
hops
and
a
bit
less
malt
than
the
classic
english
style
nice
body
easy
to
drink
with
just
a
bit
of
a
bite
at
the
finish
d
yes
i
would
gladly
drink
another
they
are
tasty
and
pleasing
strong
hoppiness
on
nose
assertive
bitterness
on
tongue
with
lingering
sweetness
behind
which
causes
it
to
lose
a
bit
of
the
refreshing
character
which
reflects
the
best
ipas
a
nice
effort
but
seems
a
bit
manipulated
everything
is
in
the
right
place
but
it
seems
almost
contrived
d
goes
down
easily
nicely
blended
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
an
ipa
that
is
pretty
true
to
style
that
is
worth
sitting
with
for
a
while
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
a
very
solid
example
of
the
style
and
definitely
recommended
d
great
the
same
price
as
bud
light
at
this
show
is
there
even
a
question
having
4
glasses
and
still
craving
more
due
to
the
lingering
taste
and
overall
great
beer
i
would
say
this
goes
down
easy
and
is
a
good
tasting
beer
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
drinkability
is
high
drinkability
on
a
patio
on
a
perfect
summer
evening
it
was
the
perfect
beer
very
good
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
sized
frothy
white
head
the
head
sticks
around
all
the
way
to
to
end
and
leaves
nice
lacing
all
around
the
glass
the
smell
right
off
reminds
me
of
a
lot
of
goose
island
brews
ive
had
before
with
a
lot
more
hoppy
kick
theres
also
some
citrus
aromas
and
its
a
little
floral
the
taste
is
hoppy
citrusy
a
tad
bit
malty
in
the
background
there
is
a
hint
of
pine
as
well
which
is
more
apparent
as
the
beer
warms
up
as
it
warms
up
there
becomes
a
small
grapefruit
taste
too
overall
the
taste
is
bitter
but
finishes
smooth
pretty
good
mouthfeel
is
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
for
an
ipa
definitely
not
lacking
at
a
little
less
than
6
abv
and
a
great
taste
this
is
a
really
drinkable
beer
this
ipa
isnt
a
hop
bomb
or
anything
but
its
refreshing
i
love
to
pick
up
some
up
when
i
can
and
i
think
its
great
on
tap
overall
another
solid
brew
from
goose
island
d
solid
if
perhaps
simple
ipa
not
groundbreaking
or
anything
but
a
very
enjoyable
midwest
ipa
very
sessionable
tastes
good
though
i
like
this
beer
pretty
good
american
ipa
as
and
english
ipa
it
does
the
trick
though
i
tend
to
prefer
the
hoppier
american
varieties
but
i
cant
criticize
them
for
doing
what
they
set
out
to
do
12oz
bottle
served
at
48
degrees
in
my
sa
perfect
pint
bottled
on
040710
indicated
on
the
label
poured
a
light
translucent
copper
with
a
half
inch
loose
bright
white
head
that
settles
into
a
solid
skim
thick
swaths
of
lacing
are
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
reveals
some
citrus
hops
and
an
earthybready
character
taste
follows
nose
some
caramel
notes
also
come
out
in
the
flavor
profile
behind
the
biscuity
character
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
very
solid
english
ipa
perfect
balance
and
very
drinkable
d
if
i
had
a
gripe
it
would
be
the
beer
is
a
tad
sweet
another
1015ibu
would
make
this
a
great
american
ipa
otherwise
its
really
more
of
a
well
hopped
american
pale
ale
that
could
be
a
tad
drier
good
beer
though
no
problem
drinking
a
couple
well
crafted
and
worth
a
try
butter
in
my
ipa
why
drinkability
easily
drinkable
reminds
me
of
the
freshness
of
spring
love
the
bitterness
of
this
beer
and
the
smell
was
possibly
the
best
aspect
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
perfect
for
the
warm
spring
and
summer
days
overall
more
refined
than
honkers
ale
so
this
beer
is
definitely
a
slight
upgrade
in
my
opinion
world
class
in
my
opinion
d
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
the
time
it
is
my
favorite
ipa
and
will
probably
be
in
till
i
find
an
ipa
that
surpasses
the
goose
island
ipa
so
thanks
to
my
chi
town
fellows
that
brew
such
a
better
wonderful
ipa
md
super
drinkable
my
new
go
to
session
ipa
at

a
sixer
the
goose
did
not
disapoint
great
fresh
offering
nothing
too
flashy
but
doesnt
advertise
as
such
great
offering
to
have
on
hand
pours
a

of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
hop
oils
floral

and
slight
citrus
fits
the
style
of
an
american
ipa
mouth
feel
is
slightly
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
floral
hop
hop
oils
sweet

slight

and
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
overall
the
hops
almost
mask
other
intrinsic
ipa
flavors
d
smooth
and
wellbalanced
high
drinkability
it
was
a
pretty
good
ipa
that
had
a
little
more
taste
and
character
to
it
than
traditional
hop
bomb
ipas
it
would
probably
go
well
with
a
burger
or
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
on
the
porch
im
not
sure
if
this
is
one
that
will
stick
in
my
memory
to
go
seek
it
out
but
if
im
in
a
bar
and
its
between
this
and
traditional
bar
alternatives
id
go
for
this
one
the
taste
is
a
bit
off
the
hops
dont
hit
the
mark
where
they
should
and
the
odd
fruity
flavors
do
not
complement
the
hop
flavors
there
is
some
leafy
bittering
hop
towards
the
finish
but
it
just
doesnt
sit
well
with
that
fruity
mid
section
there
is
a
drying
almost
saltene
flavor
towards
the
finish
that
has
some
similarities
to
the
honkers
ale
from
goose
island
that
i
just
had
this
isnt
a
bad
ipa
but
i
was
expecting
better
the
saltene
end
notes
work
better
in
the
honkers
ale
than
they
do
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
about
right
neither
smooth
and
creamy
nor
prickly
and
husky
it
splits
the
difference
nicely
the
beer
is
plenty
carbonated
d
this
would
be
good
on
a
warm
afternoon
after
going
to
a
cubs
game
an
enjoyable
serviceable
sessionable
ipa
its
nothing
special
but
is
enjoyable
enough
and
the
low
5
9
abv
is
something
to
appreciate
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
this
beers
only
downfall
this
is
my
favorite
kind
of
ipa
tons
of
hop
flavor
and
aroma
without
overwhelming
bitterness
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
deasy
to
enjoy
smooth
enjoyable
this
one
really
hit
the
spot
the
day
that
i
purchased
it
delicious
pours
a
two
finger
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
cloudy
amber
color
nose
is
light
grapefruit
hops
flavor
is
grapefruit
hops
with
a
lingering
bitter
aftertaste

1
95
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
i
wasnt
too
excited
to
try
this
beer
after
reading
some
of
the
reviews
but
when
i
went
to
the
liquor
store
there
was
a
little
starrating
tag
in
front
of
the
beer
and
i
couldnt
resist
i
was
suprised
at
how
similar
it
tasted
to
dogfish
60
minute
it
poured
ok
a
decent
body
with
a
small
halfinch
head
was
a
lot
more
clear
than
i
would
expect
for
this
style
and
the
taste
reflected
that
it
was
a
little
on
the
watery
side
id
have
this
beer
again
but
it
wasnt
my
favorite
for
this
style
not
even
close
this
is
a
decent
ipa
but
not
one
i
would
chase
again
not
sure
i
enjoy
the
dry
nature
of
it
d
this
was
smooth
sailing
for
the
ipa
lover
in
me
and
the
nonipa
drinker
in
my
gal
mouthfeel
was
not
too
thick
or
thin
this
had
plenty
of
carbonation
an
ok
ale
if
you
just
want
to
drink
one
or
two
brews
with
a
lot
of
flavor
i
dont
think
i
would
want
any
more
than
two
at
the
most
of
the
4
varieties
in
the
goose
island
mix
pack
this
ale
was
alright
but
would
be
my
least
favorite
ontap
pours
a
hazy
deeper
gold
decent
offwhite
head
with
not
a
whole
lot
of
retention
really
couldnt
spot
a
whole
lot
of
visual
difference
from
my
friends
coors
light
except
for
a
bigger
head
smell
is
fresh
hightipped
sweetgrass
very
clean
love
the
fresh
hop
scent
taste
is
maltier
with
a
light
raw
sugarlike
base
that
is
very
nice
hops
almost
act
as
support
although
you
get
a
big
spiced
even
mouthfeel
all
around
big
citrus
flavor
very
good
md
very
frothy
thicker
body
especially
for
an
ipa
nice
delicate
carbonation
im
only
good
for
a
few
of
these
cant
get
over
the
odd
faint
soapy
flavor
overall
i
was
disappointed
my
father
had
ordered
a
312
at
my
suggestion
that
night
which
put
me
in
the
mood
for
a
goose
island
for
my
second
beer
but
as
mentioned
in
taste
it
was
just
too
spicy
it
was
more
than
just
a
hoppy
floral
flavor
i
think
i
may
try
this
beer
again
in
the
fall
or
winter
when
in
the
mood
for
an
ipa
as
i
feel
it
may
please
my
senses
more
in
that
time
of
year
i
just
cant
really
say
that
i
reccomend
this
to
anyone
or
am
looking
forward
to
having
it
every
again
drinkability
very
good
simple
yet
nice
and
piney
i
sort
of
see
this
as
a
comperable
and
cheaper
version
of
some
of
the
west
coast
pine
ipas
that
i
like
the
hops
are
not
overpowering
a
good
brew
overall
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
but
nowhere
close
to
being
a
worldclass
ipa
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
fact
i
wish
i
had
more
every
aspect
of
this
ipa
can
be
identified
yet
no
characteristic
overwhelms
love
it
d
excellent
can
easily
do
a
few
of
these
4
5
da
gateway
pale
ale
in
which
aficionados
will
find
nothing
to
reproach
but
little
to
muster
their
enthusiasm
a
wonderful
beer
but
not
a
wonderful
ipa
for
better
or
worse
one
of
my
new
favorites
from
goose
island
bottled
on
2210
having
hot
dogs
with
macaroni
and
cheese
with
fresh
grated
parmesan
cheese
for
dinner
and
this
beer
pairs
perfectly
a
great
looking
beer
with
3
inch
head
in
my
duvel
tulip
s
not
very
hoppy
more
earthy
which
fits
the
english
ipa
style
t
very
refreshing
after
an
afternoon
of
running
errands
m
frothy
goodness
d
could
easily
session
these
pleasantly
drinkable
flavorful
and
not
harsh
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
drinkability
a
wonderful
drink
im
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
the
pack
when
i
get
back
to
the
states
wda
would
drink
again
and
no
doubt
refreshing
while
almost
heatstroked
while
rushing
through
my
irish
bacon
not
bad
at
all
excellent
blend
of
malt
and
hop
on
the
initial
sip
the
swallow
and
aftertaste
are
all
bitter
hop
full
bodied
without
being
too
rich
its
a
classic
example
of
the
brit
ipa
genre
drinkability
its
been
many
months
since
i
last
had
a
gi
ipa
so
i
was
very
suprised
to
be
enjoying
it
this
much
this
is
my
first
beer
from
goose
island
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
ipas
i
have
come
across
it
is
not
a
hop
bomb
or
big
ipa
but
it
is
very
drinkable
none
the
less
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
bring
someone
into
the
craft
world
if
you
know
someone
who
is
new
to
craft
this
is
a
great
initiation
beer
it
gives
them
a
proper
introduction
to
the
ipa
without
destroying
their
tongue
the
first
time
out
its
medium
body
and
carbonation
make
this
a
very
smooth
and
refreshing
beer
that
is
easy
on
the
pallete
and
wallet
i
think
this
was
my
favorite
offering
out
of
this
pack
d
decent
ipa
could
use
more
hops
for
my
liking
but
overall
a
good
beer
f
it
get
more
bitter
as
it
finishes
but
never
really
gets
very
bitter
some
earthy
spicy
hop
flavors
linger
a
bit
with
that
pale
flavor
it
actually
finishes
very
clean
too
overall
a
pretty
nice
balanced
ipa
doesnt
seem
very
english
style
but
has
some
parts
of
it
perhaps
more
of
a
marriage
of
english
and
american
basic
ipa
md
nicely
carbonated
despite
the
lack
of
head
i
am
a
bit
surprised
by
the
texture
of
this
beer
it
is
very
enjoyable
as
the
viscosity
of
this
beer
is
right
on
point
definitely
happy
that
i
picked
it
up
goose
island
india
pale
ale
does
not
disappoint
d
fairly
high
really
liked
it
glad
its
finally
in
stores
in
ma
i
bought
a
single
and
will
be
buying
more
of
these
for
sure
thank
you
goose
island
for
a
tasty
beer
and
for
dating
your
hopsensitive
products
pours
a
pretty
clear
orange
color
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
that
retains
very
well
smells
of
resiny
hops
citrus
pine
ruby
red
grapefruit
some
tropical
fruit
notes
taste
is
very
balanced
but
full
of
different
layers
of
hop
flavors
which
im
sure
the
freshness
has
to
do
with
pine
resin
citrus
grapefruit
backed
by
a
sweet
malt
presence
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
semi
dry
finish
quite
drinkable
even
better
burps
d
very
drinkable
and
all
around
great
beer
notes
pretty
balanced
hoppy
beer
not
an
amazing
beer
but
a
good
beer
for
a
hop
centered
beer
but
not
a
really
bitter
or
heavily
hopped
beer
this
is
a
very
tasty
easy
to
drink
beer
its
very
hoppy
but
not
overly
bitter
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
at
one
sitting
however
all
the
hops
will
probably
tire
out
my
palate
after
the
first
beer
id
pair
this
with
strong
flavored
food
like
spicy
thai
bbq
or
a
strong
cheese
e
g
stilton
pours
a
nice
golden
orange
very
littel
head
that
quickly
fades
aroma
is
pine
and
a
little
grapefruit
taste
is
nice
a
simple
nothing
overwhelming
or
oustanding
just
notes
of
grapefruit
and
pine
not
a
very
hoppy
ipa
and
nothing
that
makes
you
go
wow
its
a
great
session
ipa
as
its
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt
leave
you
with
that
over
hopped
mouthfeel
an
ok
example
but
there
are
much
better
out
there
libation
this
is
a
solid
crisp
smooth
ipa
that
said
its
a
bit
to
smooth
and
simple
i
like
all
the
flavors
here
but
id
prefer
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
forward
profile
its
very
drinkable
and
smooth
but
the
story
here
is
that
there
just
isnt
enough
umph
its
quite
good
but
in
my
opinion
some
minor
adjustments
could
make
this
much
better
i
knew
that
i
was
going
to
like
this
brew
after
enyoying
a
sixer
from
deciccos
in
ardsley
thats
when
i
decided
to
put
a
half
keg
in
my
beverageair
kegerator
much
better
then
the
bottle
maybe
because
it
was
kegged
10
days
before
i
tapped
it
i
called
the
brewery
to
confirm
the
date
on
the
keg
what
they
called
the
born
on
date
the
floral
hop
aroma
was
music
to
my
nose
thick
creamy
headresiny
with
nice
sticky
lace
need
to
say
more
i
dont
think
so
this
is
really
good
stuff
and
will
be
a
favorite
here
back
again
yum
not
my
favorite
ipa
but
a
decent
one
next
time
i
try
this
ill
try
a
fresher
bottle
this
one
was
too
old
bottled
62309
yikes
this
is
a
crisp
brew
with
a
smooth
medium
to
full
body
and
light
carbonation
overall
not
to
shabby
of
an
ipa
no
stone
or
a
two
hearted
but
a
good
stepping
stone
into
those
heartier
ones
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
but
does
have
a
slight
sting
of
hops
flavor
as
it
first
goes
down
it
is
pretty
easy
drinking
and
does
not
have
a
hard
aftertaste
a
really
nice
brew
d
a
solid
ipa
that
definitely
meets
gis
more
mainstream
status
this
was
quite
likeable
and
im
sure
pretty
easy
to
find
in
the
chicago
area
making
it
a
solid
choice
try
it
if
you
come
across
it
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
it
d
incredibly
drinkable
and
is
hoped
spot
on
to
the
style
that
is
trying
to
be
copied
awesome
brew
from
goose
island
smooth
and
relaxing
would
drink
again
and
again
d
a
good
solid
beer
and
quite
drinkable
not
among
my
favorite
ipas
but
a
very
approachable
brew
pours
a
opaque
yellowamber
color
that
reminds
me
of
passion
fruit
head
was
thin
and
white
but
pretty
stable
throughout
the
entirety
of
the
drink
smells
of
citrus
fruits
and
some
hops
the
taste
had
less
fruity
overtones
and
more
floral
hops
and
spices
although
there
was
a
slight
citrus
bit
to
it
decent
amount
of
carbonation
and
kick
as
my
first
ipa
i
was
definitely
impressed
and
will
look
forward
to
trying
others
i
recommend
this
beer
to
my
friends
this
is
certainly
worth
a
try
im
not
sure
what
the
cost
is
for
a
brew
like
this
but
i
would
hope
its
not
more
than
3
00pint
cheers
d
quite
enjoyable
definitive
proof
that
ipas
can
be
subtle
yet
effective
a
terrific
job
by
the
folks
at
goose
island
i
love
the
simplicity
of
this
one
d
this
is
a
lovely
ipa
this
is
a
lighter
ipa
not
a
big
ipa
like
furious
or
two
hearted
this
is
a
totally
sessionable
good
tasting
ipa
if
it
were
summer
time
id
buy
this
in
12
packs
to
drink
on
the
patio
good
stuff
overall
this
getting
a
b
overall
seems
a
little
high
i
have
had
much
better
ipas
then
this
and
this
just
doesnt
seem
to
compare
at
all
it
is
very
malty
and
doesnt
pack
a
nice
hop
punch
like
it
should
good
six
pack
in
a
night
ipa
overall
good
however
the
finished
bottle
left
me
wanting
to
find
a
stronger
better
taste
than
this
ipa
provided
d
a
pretty
good
standby
ipa
in
my
book
nothing
amazing
but
it
is
good
and
consistent
a
good
session
beer
d
very
good
i
could
easily
have
several
of
these
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
frosty
freezer
mug
wonderful
citrus
aroma
smells
of
fresh
whole
hops
nice
12
white
foamy
head
good
lacing
down
to
the
last
drop
carbonation
just
right
for
a
warm
day
on
the
deck
and
a
snappy
dry
finish
for
me
the
finish
is
one
of
the
most
important
aspects
of
a
great
ale
it
leaves
me
wanting
that
next
sip
i
love
this
brew
a
good
americanstyle
ipa
is
to
newage
brewers
what
a
béchamel
sauce
is
to
classic
french
chefs
it
is
the
most
basic
of
recipes
and
arguably
the
most
important
as
well
without
it
youre
nothing
not
surprisingly
goose
island
a
great
american
brewery
has
a
great
ipa
who
would
have
thunk
it
you
wont
go
wrong
picking
this
one
up
trust
me
more
pale
and
thin
looking
than
most
ipas
ive
come
across
understated
hoppy
citrus
smell
pine
and
sweet
grassy
floral
notes
come
out
i
love
the
taste
of
this
beer
very
crisp
sahara
desert
dry
finish
not
as
strongly
hopped
as
other
varieties
but
plenty
of
grapefruit
hoppy
bitterness
evidently
this
is
an
english
ipa
i
guess
i
like
english
ipas
i
could
say
it
tastes
like
citrus
pine
rasins
or
whatever
to
describe
the
flavor
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
tastes
like
really
good
beer
not
as
thick
and
intense
on
the
mouth
which
makes
for
a
smoother
more
drinkable
expiriance
this
screams
out
for
something
really
spicy
to
pair
with
it
i
like
it
its
good
mouthfeel
these
are
more
apt
to
struggle
down
the
stretch
losing
the
hop
and
bitter
edge
malt
begins
takeover
but
it
remains
a
drinkable
beer
because
you
start
back
fresh
for
the
first
half
of
the
pint
i
think
those
beers
that
struggle
down
the
stretch
may
just
be
the
rare
blended
batch
d
this
is
a
delicious
ipa
that
tastes
very
good
and
isnt
over
powering
worth
a
try
sometime
it
has
a
nice
bittering
spiciness
with
a
sweet
touch
that
finishes
with
a
dry
spiciness
a
very
nice
ipa
this
beer
pours
a
nice
pale
golden
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
thin
layer
of
lace
that
sticks
around
for
the
majority
of
the
session
the
aroma
is
really
nice
a
good
amount
of
sweet
malt
aroma
to
back
up
the
pronounced
clean
citrus
hop
profile
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
nice
biscuit
sweet
malt
profile
balanced
nicely
by
the
hops
at
the
end
the
medium
mouthfeel
and
good
co2
make
this
a
really
good
ipa
d
went
down
quite
nicely
with
the
second
half
of
my
amazing
meal
a
very
solid
ipa
note
im
reviewing
this
with
a
bit
of
a
cold
so
my
senses
of
taste
and
smell
are
a
bit
blocked
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
pretty
standard
ipa
aroma
pale
and
carapils
malts
along
with
loads
of
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
really
nice
bitter
hop
bite
there
is
a
good
amount
of
body
here
which
only
enhances
the
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
example
of
an
american
ipa
it
says
english
style
on
the
description
but
im
tasting
a
nice
west
coast
ipa
here
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
lowkey
ipa
im
not
a
huge
supporter
of
the
eipa
because
hops
are
the
nectar
of
the
gods
and
are
not
to
be
found
in
eipas
but
this
is
a
nice
mellow
brew
nothing
standout
but
a
solid
brew
nonetheless
overall
drinkability
is
excellent
perhaps
a
sessionable
ipa
the
bitter
finish
is
assertive
and
resinous
but
not
overpowering
and
reminds
of
bridgeport
ipa
a
good
session
ipa
very
good
hop
flavor
not
overpowering
on
the
alpha
acid
but
still
very
present
a
nice
ipa
with
character
perhaps
on
the
sweeter
end
for
my
tastes
i
prefer
the
riproaringly
hoppy
or
lusciously
fragrant
west
coast
style
but
a
good
example
all
the
same
i
find
this
more
drinkable
than
any
ipa
ive
had
after
having
read
a
few
reviews
of
this
beer
out
of
the
bottle
i
was
concerned
it
would
disappoint
but
man
did
it
deliver
a
pungent
punch
of
hoppy
bitterness
struck
me
and
lingered
on
the
palate
with
a
slight
maltiness
which
matched
nicely
i
often
struggle
to
find
other
aromas
on
my
palate
and
i
cant
identify
anything
else
but
all
i
know
is
that
this
is
what
i
want
my
beer
to
taste
like
a
sensational
ipa
and
out
of
the
bottle
it
is
as
nice
as
on
tap
imo
as
its
carbonation
was
substantially
lower
than
my
previous
sampling
amberhoney
color
clear
with
a
few
particulates
and
a
cream
colored
head
aroma
is
obvious
but
not
overwhelming
sweet
grapefruit
and
caramel
malt
are
inviting
flavor
is
milder
than
the
aroma
would
suggest
lightly
sweet
citrus
with
a
bready
malt
backbone
finishing
with
a
moderate
earthy
bitterness
neither
offensive
nor
exciting
body
is
lightmedium
and
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
noticeable
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
somewhat
average
in
terms
of
flavor
does
not
leave
me
craving
another
d
i
cant
drink
it
because
it
tastes
like
i
got
lost
in
the
forest
and
had
to
chew
on
pine
needles
to
survive
maybe
i
just
had
a
bad
bottle
but
this
seemed
almost
like
making
an
ipa
to
make
one
and
not
really
knowing
exactly
what
goes
into
it
nice
super
smooth
mouthfeel
moderate
fine
carbonation
easy
to
drink
goes
down
very
nicely
i
paired
2
of
these
with
a
bunch
of
different
cheeses
and
the
combination
couldnt
of
been
better
very
good
ipa
as
well
as
a
great
session
beer
d
high
for
a
spicy
and
bitter
beer
it
is
strong
but
at
the
same
time
hard
to
put
down
d
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
can
see
becoming
a
regular
for
me
also
a
very
refreshing
beer
to
come
home
to
after
a
hard
day
of
work
ive
become
increasingly
impressed
with
goose
islands
yearround
offerings
drinkability
all
day
baby
this
is
such
a
solid
beer
that
has
such
a
simple
presence
that
it
makes
it
hard
not
to
drink
i
like
the
bitter
and
the
citrusy
aspect
of
it
and
found
it
to
be
quite
refreshing
also
the
really
nice
aspect
about
goose
island
is
that
its
really
reasonably
priced
only
6
99
for
a
sixer
of
this
offering
so
its
definitely
going
to
find
its
way
to
my
fridge
picked
this
one
up
of
the
singles
shelf
at
simones
beverage
in
lakewood
ohio
it
was
pretty
cheap
around
1
50
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
out
of
this
one
poured
from
bottle
into
a
nice
clean
12
oz
snifter
appearance
and
smell
that
i
would
consider
averagenormal
for
an
ipa
taste
hello
taste
taste
are
you
there
very
boring
average
ipa
with
low
drinkability
because
i
gotta
have
flavor
wouldnt
go
out
searching
for
this
one
if
your
more
into
flavorful
ipas
and
doubleimperial
ipas
d
very
drinkable
can
fill
anyones
hop
fix
if
ever
encountered
poured
out
of
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
dark
gold
color
slight
haze
left
a
12
tight
white
head
with
pretty
good
retention
some
lacing
smell
is
good
citrusy
taste
reveals
a
pretty
powerful
hop
presence
plenty
of
bitterness
no
surprise
from
the
initial
smell
very
citrusy
good
carbonation
leaves
your
mouth
a
little
dry
though
considering
that
i
would
say
the
drinkability
was
just
okay
leaves
an
aftertaste
just
to
remind
you
of
what
you
drank
overall
a
good
ipa
though
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
6
pack
of
this
quite
easily
i
am
thinking
seems
to
be
very
drinkable
because
it
is
light
and
not
overpowering
t
m
d
bit
backbone
of
citrusy
hops
cascade
hops
perhaps
the
grapefruit
notes
in
the
nose
come
through
well
in
the
flavor
a
bit
of
toasted
malt
as
well
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
creamy
maybe
even
a
bit
oily
on
the
finish
a
good
example
of
an
ipa
that
is
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
overall
a
decent
taste
profile
on
this
one
and
certainly
looked
the
part
but
not
quite
bold
enough
to
make
a
statement
right
in
between
an
apa
and
an
ipa
though
id
probably
put
it
a
little
closer
to
the
latter
cant
really
compete
with
the
more
flavorful
ipas
out
there
a
nonoffensive
beer
to
have
while
watching
the
game
but
not
one
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
on
its
own
there
are
more
interesting
english
ipas
out
there
easily
forgettable
appearance
is
a
slightly
cloudyhazy
golden
color
it
has
a
nice
frothy
head
this
ipa
has
a
nice
floral
hop
aroma
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
ipa
with
just
the
right
amount
of
maltiness
not
too
bitter
with
a
nice
finish
has
a
nice
smooth
and
silky
mouthfeel
not
very
much
carbonation
but
not
a
bad
thing
with
this
one
i
really
like
this
one
one
of
my
new
favorite
ipas
drinkability
is
high
as
a
sessionable
ipa
i
enjoyed
the
citrus
hoppyness
and
think
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
ipa
not
the
best
ever
but
enjoyable
example
of
the
style
for
sure
overall
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
memorable
beer
will
make
you
hungry
if
you
drink
more
probably
from
being
so
light
wellbalanced
ipa
with
all
the
desirable
attributes
and
nice
i
can
pick
it
up
at
my
local
supermarket
any
time
this
will
likely
become
a
regular
entry
into
my
beer
rotation
the
taste
is
rather
boring
with
hints
of
lemon
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
cant
crush
this
12
oz
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
hazy
orangered
color
with
a
good
sized
billowy
white
head
good
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
malts
light
but
very
good
citrus
and
pine
hop
aroma
flavor
is
fruity
grapefruits
citrus
and
pine
hops
again
good
balance
of
flavor
and
bittering
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
creamy
smooth
finish
with
a
slight
kick
of
hop
bitterness
good
beer
very
drinkable
i
like
this
one
overall
a
nice
everday
ipa
to
have
on
hand
in
your
fridge
tasty
tangy
and
fresh
tasting
mouthfeeldrinkability
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
active
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
overall
a
nicely
drinkable
ipa
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ipa
goose
island
has
a
trend
going
with
their
year
around
beers
and
seasonals
harvest
ale
summer
ale
that
makes
them
a
little
more
tame
for
the
bmc
drinkers
and
this
is
evident
in
this
beer
it
is
not
a
altogether
bad
beer
but
very
one
sided
and
not
even
to
the
good
side
good
intro
beer
for
the
up
and
coming
craft
person
but
i
will
let
it
sit
at
the
sidelines
unless
there
is
nothing
better
to
drink
goose
island
india
pale
ale
is
a
hazy
golden
beer
that
leaves
a
white
ring
around
the
glass
it
has
a
hoppy
citrus
aroma
pine
resin
is
detected
it
smells
slightly
sweet
and
floral
it
has
a
lively
smooth
medium
body
with
a
crisp
finish
it
has
a
nice
piny
bitterness
thats
well
balanced
by
a
light
sweetness
it
tastes
so
fresh
and
so
good
drinkability
not
having
had
too
many
goose
islands
id
have
to
say
my
first
experiences
are
mostly
pleasant
thoughtful
good
tasting
easy
drinking
beers
d
nicely
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
ipa
the
hops
arent
in
your
face
but
still
has
great
flavor
plus
the
modest
abv
makes
this
a
great
session
beer
i
had
this
ontap
at
city
crab
in
nyc
and
it
paired
great
with
crab
cakes
the
only
criticism
is
that
it
lacks
any
superstar
qualities
it
could
be
sweeter
for
my
tastes
md
feels
like
an
ipa
lighter
body
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
make
this
one
a
good
thirst
quencher
but
nothing
more
d
rather
pleasant
overall
it
could
have
used
another
layer
of
depth
but
wholly
pleasant
and
im
glad
to
see
it
available
in
many
nonbeerspecific
bars
around
nyc
its
a
highly
drinkable
highly
enjoyable
above
average
ipa
d
this
is
a
nice
ipa
its
fairly
low
abv
makes
it
go
down
easily
the
fruit
sweetness
in
the
flavor
is
a
nice
change
from
many
beers
of
this
type
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
drinkability
ive
always
heard
good
things
about
this
ipa
but
have
never
had
the
chance
to
try
it
the
highlights
of
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
have
been
combined
seamlessly
this
is
a
very
sessionable
high
quality
ipa
this
beer
has
a
somewhat
hazy
and
golden
amber
appearance
it
has
a
slightly
hoppy
scent
the
taste
is
pretty
good
a
definite
hop
bite
but
it
doesnt
over
do
it
its
also
has
a
nice
citrus
hint
this
beer
isnt
highly
carbonated
the
combination
of
these
makes
the
beer
very
refreshing
im
glad
i
was
able
to
bring
a
few
back
to
tx
pours
a
nice
light
amber
goldenrod
straw
color
with
a
healthy
heaping
of
pale
head
smell
is
hoppy
sticky
citrusy
floral
piney
and
yummy
taste
is
right
on
par
with
the
smell
if
not
a
little
behind
with
not
quite
the
level
of
bitterness
that
the
aroma
suggests
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
good
d
substantial
refreshing
and
poundable
got
to
love
that
in
an
ipa
i
originally
had
this
as
an
a
but
upgraded
my
review
because
i
have
been
spending
some
quality
time
with
it
a
really
delicious
brew
i
am
a
home
brewer
always
looking
for
new
beers
to
try
and
than
try
to
replicate
i
was
walking
through
my
local
package
store
in
mankato
mn
and
found
this
ale
i
have
a
friend
who
is
also
a
home
brewer
who
suggested
i
try
goose
island
products
sometime
so
i
picked
up
a
sixer
of
pale
ale
very
impressed
not
really
that
bitter
for
a
indian
pale
ale
but
i
believe
i
like
this
better
than
most
you
could
definetly
get
yourself
in
trouble
downing
a
six
pack
on
a
warm
afternoon
very
nice
but
not
over
powering
citrus
aroma
bitterness
right
to
my
liking
drank
it
out
of
a
bottle
nice
graphics
by
the
way
i
recommend
very
highly
lastly
it
taste
alot
like
brau
brothers
brewing
pale
ale
either
one
is
a
good
choice
d
not
really
as
bitter
or
hoppy
as
i
was
expecting
an
easy
drinking
brew
but
it
feels
more
like
an
apa
and
not
an
ipa
drinkability
i
like
it
i
could
do
more
of
this
one
when
im
in
the
mood
for
some
crisp
hoppiness
would
like
to
try
this
one
on
tap
in
chicago
some
day
this
beer
pours
an
ordinary
orange
color
common
with
other
ipas
that
i
have
had
there
is
a
nice
two
finger
head
to
the
pour
with
a
good
amount
of
cling
to
the
glass
the
smell
reminds
me
of
your
average
ipa
with
hints
of
pine
citrus
and
light
malts
the
taste
is
current
with
the
smells
you
get
a
nice
if
somewhat
weak
balance
of
hops
there
is
a
nice
hop
and
malt
balance
that
finishes
off
smooth
and
noncommital
overall
this
was
in
my
opinion
an
average
ipa
and
good
but
not
anything
that
would
draw
me
back
to
it
i
percieved
a
lack
of
strength
in
the
beer
but
it
had
a
good
balanced
taste
an
okay
ipa
however
nothing
extraordinary
had
this
a
while
back
but
took
some
notes
poured
a
golden
color
with
frothy
white
head
that
faded
moderately
quickly
and
left
lots
of
lacing
smelled
of
piney
hops
caramel
malt
and
some
hints
of
citrus
tasted
very
similar
minus
the
citrus
pretty
smooth
just
slightly
overcarbonated
very
easy
to
drink
d
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
considering
the
low
abv
for
an
ipa
along
with
the
cheap
price
tag
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
will
become
a
staple
in
my
fridge
this
summer
yes
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
tasty
not
too
high
of
an
abv
would
be
great
on
a
warm
summer
day
overall
a
very
solid
representation
of
the
style
with
the
earthy
hops
lingering
on
the
palate
a
very
well
rounded
ipa
highly
drinkable
recommended
great
finish
smooth
but
a
tad
watery
a
great
allpurpose
ipa
id
pick
up
a
six
pack
in
a
heartbeat
drinks
pretty
smooth
through
the
hops
this
beer
has
a
nice
amber
haze
to
it
and
and
a
nice
foam
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
after
the
pour
a
standard
ipa
smell
to
it
hops
and
goodness
very
good
balance
between
the
malt
and
the
hops
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
at
the
beginning
and
then
the
hops
dominate
after
the
first
second
motuhfeel
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
for
an
ipa
atleast
to
me
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ipa
i
could
finish
half
the
6pack
tonight
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
and
most
recently
on
tap
while
visiting
goose
island
while
in
chicago
this
is
a
quality
representative
of
the
ipa
style
so
there
is
not
much
i
can
add
to
this
other
than
to
say
it
is
a
prototypical
ipa
and
a
well
done
one
at
that
hops
pine
and
citrus
it
is
quite
drinkable
as
well
drinkability
a
great
ipa
whose
aroma
doesnt
really
match
the
flavor
i
wish
the
taste
was
more
like
the
aroma
a
solid
session
brew
worthy
of
case
purchase
d
very
very
drinkable
has
some
dipa
characteristics
i
think
this
could
only
get
better
with
the
presence
of
some
fresh
hops
one
of
the
better
ipas
ive
had
i
will
seek
out
a
fresh
bottle
i
think
this
review
is
probably
low
because
the
hops
have
faded
but
im
reviewing
the
beer
in
front
of
me
drinkability
easy
to
drink
though
a
little
sweet
overall
this
is
good
but
has
the
hop
profile
of
an
apa
to
me
i
would
get
again
for
the
right
price
had
this
on
tap
at
the
el
bait
shop
in
des
moines
poured
in
a
pint
glass
appears
a
nice
dark
golden
color
with
a
pretty
decent
head
aroma
of
mostly
grapefruit
and
some
pine
taste
is
quite
balanced
it
has
a
very
good
fruity
flavor
with
hints
of
spiciness
it
ends
with
a
nice
sweet
citrusy
note
good
beer
and
a
good
session
ale
hope
to
see
this
beer
in
tx
some
day
d
this
was
the
freshest
goose
island
ipa
i
have
ever
had
and
it
was
excellent
easy
to
session
too
d
very
easy
to
drink
could
session
this
ipa
all
night
nothing
groundbreaking
here
but
an
extremely
solid
drinkable
ipa
from
goose
island
would
definitely
have
this
often
if
it
was
available
d
good
intro
drinkability
not
as
good
as
i
remember
from
in
the
past
but
i
think
my
ipa
tastes
have
changed
as
i
used
to
think
furious
was
too
bitter
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
honkers
ale
shaker
pint
glass
appears
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
about
a
finger
of
fluffy
lingering
bone
white
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
toasted
grains
sweet
malts
lemony
bitter
hops
mildly
grassy
a
touch
of
grapefruit
and
caramel
this
ipa
is
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
certainly
worth
seeking
out
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
this
ipa
has
a
nice
flavor
but
it
just
does
not
seem
that
inspired
to
get
a
better
review
to
me
it
seems
a
little
light
on
the
flavor
side
maybe
to
make
it
more
marketable
i
wish
it
would
kick
me
in
the
mouth
a
little
bit
more
d
moderate
abv
and
good
balance
make
this
one
very
drinkable
pours
a
deep
golden
color
the
smell
is
an
earthy
blend
of
spicy
hops
and
toasty
malt
the
taste
is
solid
it
is
brewed
with
four
variety
of
hops
styrianfuggle
centennial
and
cascade
the
slightest
sweetness
of
fruit
touches
your
tongue
at
first
taste
but
is
quickly
held
back
by
the
dry
malty
middle
which
is
cut
through
by
the
medley
pine
from
the
hops
nice
and
dry
with
a
good
aftertaste
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
dangerously
drinkable
while
their
are
other
examples
of
the
style
i
still
prefer
furious
hop
ottingreen
flash
this
beer
is
quite
tasty
very
drinkable
and
i
could
easily
drink
it
all
day
considering
it
is
5
9
compared
to
most
the
ipasiipas
i
drink
props
to
goose
island
for
this
solid
regular
release
d
this
is
a
solid
ipa
not
my
first
choice
out
there
but
worthwhile
id
give
it
a
whirl
again
d
nicely
balanced
ipa
though
i
think
i
may
be
growing
out
of
the
style
not
overly
hoppy
or
malty
mission
accomplished
d
a
decent
beer
that
would
be
a
good
session
beer
if
the
abv
were
lower
a
damn
fine
ipa
hop
maniacs
might
not
be
overly
impressed
but
i
find
the
balance
of
strength
and
smoothness
of
this
brew
to
be
admirable
theres
way
better
ipas
out
there
that
are
in
the
same
price
range
and
a
lot
more
better
in
flavor
i
would
skip
on
this
one
if
you
come
across
it
definitely
recommend
d
good
drinkability
for
an
ipa
flavors
blend
very
nicely
goose
calls
this
an
englishstyle
ipa
but
i
find
it
balanced
more
to
hops
than
most
english
varieties
well
im
disappointed
i
was
hoping
for
a
lot
more
from
this
you
live
and
learn
d
ive
recently
had
a
kick
with
dipa
and
iipas
and
it
had
been
a
while
since
i
had
a
gi
ipa
it
was
one
of
the
first
ipas
i
got
into
and
for
some
reason
i
was
expecting
less
when
i
came
back
to
it
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
hop
character
and
the
overall
balance
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
and
delicious
ipa
excellent
and
accessible
ipa
aside
from
the
bourban
c
stout
this
one
is
definitely
a
gem
from
an
all
around
pretty
good
selection
of
brews
on
draft
at
the
brewpub
in
the
summer
2008
ive
had
this
many
times
and
i
find
that
it
is
as
good
in
the
bottle
as
on
tap
cascade
centennial
and
fuggle
hops
combine
for
a
nice
floral
nose
the
pale
malt
backbone
matches
the
hops
in
a
light
way
a
bit
heavy
for
a
quick
quaffer
but
too
good
for
a
lawnmower
only
keep
some
around
in
the
summer
for
those
hot
days
this
is
a
good
product
by
gi
and
very
available
and
economical
in
my
locale
it
makes
for
a
great
session
ipa
or
even
an
introductory
ipa
for
a
newbie
d
i
have
no
problem
drinking
this
one
and
look
forward
to
the
other
5
not
all
in
one
night
most
likely
giipa
as
i
like
to
call
it
has
a
nice
palegolden
color
with
a
finger
width
head
it
has
a
very
nice
floral
character
to
the
nose
it
has
a
nice
citrus
hop
flavor
with
some
nice
sweet
malts
and
a
good
bitterness
at
the
end
it
has
a
nice
medium
body
and
is
overall
a
very
good
and
drinkable
beer
the
beer
is
smooth
at
first
and
moves
towards
a
more
gritty
mouthfeel
from
some
astringent
hop
acidity
its
presence
is
a
nice
compliment
to
warm
barley
grain
flavors
well
balanced
and
a
fantastic
beer
there
are
ipas
better
out
there
but
this
one
is
a
solid
brew
it
is
a
complete
package
of
good
looks
great
scents
and
a
more
then
pleasing
flavor
drink
it
d
a
good
ipa
with
great
balance
not
too
hoppy
although
it
is
older
and
nice
and
malty
too
a
good
sessioner
i
could
any
time
of
the
year
easy
to
drink
could
drink
one
after
the
other
all
night
long
d
this
is
an
ipa
that
should
appeal
to
a
wide
group
of
beer
fans
while
it
will
not
knock
you
over
the
head
with
huge
ibus
it
will
leave
you
satisfied
if
your
goal
is
a
well
balanced
hop
forward
tasty
brew
i
look
forward
to
many
of
these
for
years
to
come
honey
amber
with
a
ton
of
suspended
yeast
particles
patchy
white
head
that
leaves
fine
lace
on
the
glass
cascade
hops
and
toasty
grain
in
the
nose
with
some
citrus
fruitiness
tastes
nice
and
hoppy
but
well
balanced
not
an
extreme
dipa
just
a
tasty
brew
that
always
hits
the
spot
creamy
and
smooth
bodied
good
stuff
and
a
steal
for
8
a
sixer
taste
bitter
hoppy
taste
that
lasts
throughout
the
drink
there
is
a
hint
of
a
flowery
taste
which
could
be
called
sweet
and
is
a
good
balance
to
the
bitterness
my
bottle
says
that
it
was
bottled
110408
thats
about
four
months
ago
it
also
says
that
i
should
pour
into
a
tulip
glass
but
i
chose
my
pilsner
glass
instead
the
beer
has
a
nice
cloudy
orangeyellow
hue
and
a
wellretained
large
bubbled
head
the
foam
sticks
to
the
glass
as
its
drank
down
the
aroma
is
not
overpowering
which
is
good
smells
hoppy
and
citrusy
with
a
bit
of
pine
tastes
bitterly
hopped
and
fruity
in
very
good
ways
no
lingering
unpleasant
aftertaste
either
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
good
ipa
consumed
at
fifty
degrees
a
nice
surprise
pours
light
orange
with
thin
head
and
almost
suspended
carbonation
smells
of
faint
citrus
and
slight
pine
hops
up
front
and
bready
out
the
back
with
surprising
balance
for
the
lack
of
abv
an
enjoyable
ipa
but
nothing
outstanding
drinkability
pretty
high
cut
the
stickiness
a
little
in
the
aftertaste
and
i
could
drink
it
all
day
i
think
its
a
good
gateway
ipa
not
too
bitter
not
too
overwhelming
very
drinkable
will
buy
again
drinkability
is
good
highly
drinkablelower
abv
than
many
ipas
makes
it
a
solid
goto
ipa
i
really
like
their
ipa
its
not
the
best
one
out
there
but
its
one
that
can
be
put
back
easily
and
one
of
the
more
balanced
its
almost
like
its
trying
to
be
english
good
stuff
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
head
good
retention
smell
is
lightly
citrus
but
mostly
biscuitlike
taste
is
a
little
too
malty
for
my
liking
its
good
for
the
style
but
i
like
hop
heavier
ipas
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
this
is
very
drinkable
and
i
could
drink
a
six
pack
in
a
sitting
easy
im
a
big
fan
of
goose
island
but
feel
a
little
let
down
by
this
offering
i
think
they
didnt
use
enough
bittering
hops
to
really
make
this
beer
stand
out
if
they
ever
make
a
dry
hopped
version
of
this
i
think
it
would
be
a
perfect
balance
overall
a
decent
ipa
but
not
one
ill
look
out
for
in
bottles
again
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
on
tap
to
see
if
it
the
hops
had
just
faded
in
this
bottle
d
this
one
is
definitely
on
the
hoppy
side
but
it
drinks
and
finishes
smooth
so
for
the
style
it
is
an
easy
drinker
overall
a
very
good
beer
from
gibc
bottle
into
tulip
good
but
not
spectacular
aroma
good
color
and
lacing
throughout
mediumbodied
citrus
piney
notes
an
above
average
india
pale
ale
good
bitter
finish
and
very
enjoyable
one
plus
is
it
is
the
only
ipa
at
our
wm
supercenter
so
cheers
to
that
when
i
need
an
ipa
fix
and
am
among
the
masses
pours
a
huge
head
light
tan
big
bubbles
lasting
good
lacing
very
clear
light
amber
body
very
bitter
hoppy
aroma
just
lots
of
bitter
acid
surprisingly
balanced
taste
malty
with
a
little
hops
cleaner
and
sweeter
on
the
end
not
very
complex
or
overall
flavorful
okay
but
more
a
pale
than
an
ipa
d
pretty
good
but
unbalanced
in
a
way
i
just
didnt
dig
as
much
as
other
ipas
d
oh
man
i
could
drink
this
all
night
great
flavor
good
body
and
not
too
high
alcohol
content
a
sessionable
delicious
beer
the
taste
is
a
well
balanced
ipa
hoppy
but
not
overpowering
this
is
the
third
selection
that
i
have
had
from
goose
island
and
i
am
impressed
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
just
makes
you
kind
of
hungry
like
a
lot
of
ipas
tend
to
good
drinkability
a
couple
of
these
would
compliment
a
plate
of
hot
wings
well
a
super
ipa
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
full
extremley
drinkable
indeed
d
the
sourness
and
lack
of
that
hop
freshness
taste
made
this
one
a
little
harder
to
get
through
i
greatly
preferred
this
beer
when
it
was
darn
cold
but
its
still
a
solidly
crafted
ipa
upon
warming
too
i
cant
say
i
was
overly
impressed
with
the
lack
of
taste
and
safistication
its
not
bad
but
it
doesnt
have
much
to
distinguish
itself
just
another
overproduced
micro
on
its
way
to
macro
land
d
i
was
highly
impressed
with
goose
islands
ipa
and
will
pull
for
a
sixer
of
this
boy
the
next
time
im
so
inclinded
a
smooth
and
sweet
ipa
at
first
with
growing
hops
bitter
bang
not
far
behind
good
clean
delivery
and
not
too
shabby
in
the
ibu
tally
count
this
is
the
ipa
if
you
want
something
creamy
but
still
full
of
hops
notes
a
drinkable
ipa
overallnice
ipa
well
balanced
and
tasty
im
a
fan
with
that
said
goose
island
hasnt
produced
another
style
that
i
consider
worthy
of
even
brewing
sorry
i
just
feel
it
needs
to
be
said
i
can
drink
ten
of
these
babies
full
of
flavor
but
goes
down
easy
nose
is
delicious
and
hoppy
running
the
gamut
from
piney
to
slightly
floral
to
sweet
citrus
flavors
follow
the
nose
leaning
toward
pine
with
a
good
dose
of
juicy
citrus
thrown
in
for
good
measure
mediumbodied
and
crisp
leaving
me
wanting
another
sip
a
solid
ipa
overall
good
beer
again
hops
prevail
this
is
what
an
american
ipa
should
be
in
my
mind
this
is
a
favorite
of
my
beer
buddies
and
has
many
times
been
considered
the
best
all
around
ipa
we
have
tried
d
the
flavor
and
generous
carbonation
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
edit
just
realized
this
one
was
about
5
months
old
at
time
of
consumption
probably
not
a
very
fair
assessment
cheers
drinkability
a
decent
balanced
ipa
that
satisfies
both
the
hophead
and
the
mainstream
md
body
is
light
carbonation
is
slightly
prickly
but
feels
appropriate
extremely
drinkable
nothing
over
the
top
here
just
a
good
american
ipa
hv
maybe
i
didnt
let
it
warm
enough
when
i
had
it
a
few
days
ago
but
i
definitely
wasnt
especially
impressed
but
this
is
a
good
beer
i
even
thought
at
the
time
that
it
was
more
of
a
pale
than
an
ipa
but
maybe
the
temp
or
something
i
had
eaten
or
having
been
traveling
all
day
or
some
combinagtion
thereof
obscured
my
palate
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
nice
d
i
bought
this
actually
thinking
about
sn
celebration
ale
i
dont
think
gi
ipa
gets
enough
credit
after
bcs
and
matilda
this
is
goose
islands
best
and
its
so
classic
and
versatile
i
remember
drinking
this
at
a
music
fest
downtown
chicago
in
july
and
the
hops
tasting
just
as
good
in
90
degrees
as
they
do
tonight
in
chicago
with
snow
and
9
degrees
probably
my
favortie
ipa
wow
this
is
a
great
tasting
ipa
the
pineapple
taste
mirrors
the
scent
great
hop
bitterness
at
the
onset
during
the
drink
and
at
the
finish
but
without
the
bitter
aftertaste
this
ipa
will
not
burn
the
mouth
out
but
man
is
it
satisfying
very
smooth
and
crisp
i
really
like
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
a
bit
watery
but
that
just
makes
it
go
down
easier
this
beers
good
but
i
think
i
have
screwed
myself
up
as
of
late
because
i
have
been
tasting
a
lot
of
imperial
ipas
this
beer
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
in
light
of
what
i
have
been
drinking
pretty
light
body
mild
carbonation
this
is
not
a
bad
ipa
at
all
and
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
for
me
i
liked
this
one
not
a
total
hop
bomb
i
would
be
able
to
drink
a
few
of
these
without
overloading
the
tastebuds
with
bitterness
drinkability
this
is
very
nice
for
the
craft
swilling
needs
if
i
needed
a
six
or
twelve
for
just
kicking
back
and
watching
a
game
or
going
to
a
movie
marathon
i
could
take
this
as
one
of
the
better
choices
very
smooth
to
kick
back
with
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
easily
sessionable
ipa
i
was
down
three
of
these
before
i
could
blink
this
guy
does
everything
really
well
but
not
great
a
good
go
to
ipa
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
though
the
taste
is
average
for
an
ipa
serving
type
bottle
pours
a
hazy
sedimenty
copper
with
fluffy
white
head
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
strong
of
caramel
malt
and
very
sweet
hop
smell
is
minimal
taste
is
stongly
of
malt
which
was
unexpected
some
citrus
hops
but
overall
somewhat
bland
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
light
thanks
to
the
moderately
high
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
nothing
amazing
i
should
have
check
the
date
on
it
becuase
the
overall
hop
presence
seemed
to
be
dull
hopefully
it
was
just
an
older
bottle
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
its
a
bit
weak
for
the
style
so
its
tough
to
give
a
really
high
score
here
d
highly
drinkable
no
alcohol
presence
at
all
would
taste
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
very
good
american
ipa
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
would
think
of
it
as
a
british
ipa
with
american
hops
worth
trying
an
extremely
well
balanced
and
tasty
ipa
from
goose
island
i
just
wish
that
i
had
better
access
to
this
as
it
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
for
a
quick
hoppy
fix
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
in
color
theres
about
three
inches
of
head
atop
the
beer
smell
is
piney
hops
taste
is
more
of
the
piney
grassy
hops
theres
a
little
bit
of
a
juicy
citrus
hop
flavor
as
well
very
good
biting
mouthfeel
this
is
a
good
ipa
very
drinkable
and
a
beer
that
one
could
easily
have
a
session
with
pretty
hoppy
and
it
has
a
bite
but
if
you
are
into
that
kind
of
beer
then
this
one
should
be
right
up
your
alley
good
ipa
pretty
straight
forward
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
not
a
prime
ipa
but
worth
a
try
received
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
with
buckeyenation
thanks
pours
golden
a
little
on
the
paler
side
and
very
slightly
hazy
okay
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
swirl
fairly
nice
hoppy
aroma
with
citrus
and
some
light
malt
the
taste
is
a
little
lighter
on
the
hops
and
heavier
on
the
thin
sweet
malt
some
earthy
bitterness
on
the
finish
but
pretty
light
somewhat
thin
but
pleasant
enough
d
this
is
an
above
average
ipa
meaning
it
is
not
overly
bitter
as
some
can
be
yet
it
is
assertive
in
it
hop
taste
as
it
should
be
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
very
tasty
draft
at
goose
island
clybourn
brewpub
a
clear
pale
gold
little
head
or
carbonation
seems
to
be
a
trend
here
lovely
aroma
of
well
of
marijuana
lovely
fresh
hop
flavour
and
theres
that
weed
again
this
is
wonderful
stuff
the
star
of
the
show
at
goose
island
this
evening
they
are
out
of
the
imperial
ipa
i
cant
imagine
what
that
would
be
like
hard
to
top
this
felt
great
good
carbonation
gives
a
crisp
finish
leaving
little
bitter
aftertaste
wow
this
is
a
well
crafted
ipa
in
all
aspects
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
into
my
glass
there
is
a
thick
foamy
head
that
immediately
forms
and
eventually
simmers
down
to
a
fine
creamy
film
carbonation
is
slightly
visible
and
a
thick
lacing
forms
all
the
way
down
the
glass
this
beer
is
very
aromatic
a
bouquet
of
spices
malts
and
bitter
hops
fill
my
senses
this
is
a
very
traditional
aroma
that
is
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
full
with
a
very
nice
finish
the
flavor
is
outstanding
spicy
and
citrus
flavors
from
the
hops
immediately
hit
followed
by
a
smooth
maltiness
at
first
the
intensity
from
the
hops
overwhelm
my
palate
but
after
a
few
tastes
this
beer
comes
together
in
wonderful
fashion
well
rounded
and
outstanding
in
all
categories
well
done
i
probably
would
have
had
a
second
one
had
there
not
been
a
tempting
tap
full
of
sixpoint
sweet
action
right
next
to
it
drinkability
a
chicago
classic
a
very
sessionable
brew
good
intro
to
the
love
of
the
hops
pours
a
golden
brown
with
a
one
finger
head
that
dissipates
somewhat
but
leaves
decent
lacing
throughout
smell
is
of
hops
hops
and
more
hops
taste
is
excellent
piney
hops
come
through
strongly
followed
by
malt
make
this
a
very
strong
tasting
but
wellbalanced
ipa
its
very
drinkable
and
definitely
sessionable
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
to
pick
up
when
im
watching
a
game
or
just
relaxing
and
drinking
beer
this
was
the
first
ipa
i
ever
had
and
its
still
one
of
my
favorites
a
very
solid
moderate
ipa
this
is
just
a
nice
standard
ipa
good
solid
hop
backbone
and
nice
malts
that
dont
get
in
the
way
if
i
lived
in
chicago
this
could
be
a
go
to
ipa
d
having
this
after
flying
all
day
so
maybe
its
going
down
better
than
it
should
but
its
pretty
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
at
that
d
i
am
not
normally
an
ipa
person
but
i
like
this
one
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
there
are
some
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
but
this
is
still
a
good
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
pours
to
a
good
head
that
had
some
nice
lacing
brownish
gold
in
color
with
a
offwhite
head
ale
was
kind
of
hazy
you
could
also
detect
this
hazy
appearance
when
pouring
also
left
some
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
smelled
of
hops
citrus
and
pine
i
think
the
pine
smell
was
the
strongest
smelled
good
in
the
nose
almost
a
floral
smell
tasted
a
lot
like
it
smelled
good
flavour
of
pine
citrus
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
pine
taste
hung
around
for
a
while
felt
good
in
the
mouth
carbonation
was
good
also
i
would
love
to
make
this
a
session
beer
but
i
think
it
might
get
me
in
trouble
because
i
would
drink
them
to
fast
pours
smooth
with
a
darker
orange
coloring
and
haze
very
pretty
to
look
at
smell
of
hops
is
intoxicating
but
not
overwhelming
taste
is
surprisingly
light
for
an
ipa
a
little
citruslike
tint
to
the
taste
nice
afterbite
feels
light
goes
down
easily
probably
a
very
good
session
brew
my
friends
love
this
beer
i
think
its
alright
but
ive
had
better
ipas
i
think
this
one
was
designed
by
the
brewery
accountants
which
mosher
talks
about
in
radical
brewing
seems
like
they
skimped
us
good
on
the
malt
and
especially
the
hops
its
not
bad
just
a
big
let
down
for
an
ipa
d
subtle
hoppiness
makes
this
extremely
drinkable
nice
beer
d
meh
it
was
ok
i
probably
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
anytime
soon
unless
i
see
it
on
tap
somewhere
there
was
nothing
i
had
against
it
really
its
just
kind
of
boring
i
liked
it
and
thought
this
could
be
a
good
session
beer
really
an
enjoyable
beer
east
to
drink
and
flavorful
notes
had
this
on
tap
in
chicago
once
or
twice
and
it
seems
to
translate
well
in
bottle
form
definitely
a
repeat
buy
for
these
summer
months
d
uber
well
this
was
a
hard
ipa
to
get
a
handle
on
as
it
seemed
reluctant
to
show
its
self
in
the
glass
the
hops
took
awhile
to
appear
and
then
the
malt
backbone
had
to
be
coaxed
out
the
beer
is
low
in
carbonation
and
slightly
oily
to
the
taste
it
doesnt
have
the
fresh
punch
that
i
look
for
in
an
ipa
but
once
it
warms
up
it
proves
a
sessionable
example
of
the
style
a
great
try
for
any
ipa
advocate
uniquely
flavored
and
easy
to
drink
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
oily
adn
didnt
dry
the
palate
at
the
finish
which
would
make
it
tough
to
session
as
it
gets
sort
of
heavy
feeling
after
one
or
two
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
i
kept
licking
the
top
of
my
mouth
after
each
sip
overall
a
relatively
mild
ipa
could
certainly
be
an
intro
to
the
style
for
those
unfamiliar
this
would
also
be
a
great
session
brew
overall
a
wonderful
example
of
an
ipa
that
leans
just
a
bit
more
towards
hops
but
showcases
their
wonderful
flavor
properties
not
just
tries
to
numb
your
tongue
highly
recommended
l
poured
in
to
a
tulip
glass
as
recommended
i
recommend
tulip
glasses
for
almost
all
beers
very
thick
head
that
leaves
thick
rings
as
you
drink
deep
color
slightly
cloudy
excellent
taste
tastes
good
very
cold
this
is
a
very
readily
available
beer
in
chicago
area
that
is
hard
to
beat
i
keep
trying
other
ipas
but
keep
coming
back
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
highly
drinkable
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
begs
to
have
another
drink
although
i
usually
like
my
ipas
to
have
a
little
more
bite
i
still
highly
recommend
this
beer
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
goose
island
styles
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
nice
orangeamber
color
to
it
started
off
with
an
inch
of
head
but
died
down
to
a
small
layer
on
top
of
the
liquid
left
moderate
lacing
smells
of
earth
and
fruits
initially
a
mild
fruity
taste
that
turns
into
a
moderate
bitterness
not
too
interesting
but
not
bad
finish
is
pretty
short
low
to
medium
amount
of
carbonation
that
made
it
have
a
nice
soft
mouthfeel
however
its
easy
drinking
and
people
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
few
in
a
sitting
dvery
smoothe
and
balanced
for
an
aipaalso
nice
to
be
able
to
enjoy
some
beer
that
is
brewed
in
my
home
state
d
even
though
this
beer
isnt
balanced
the
hops
work
for
this
brew
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
md
full
bodied
and
smooth
feel
very
drinkable
ipa
a
golden
orangish
color
with
a
white
head
that
is
a
quarter
inch
high
develops
piny
and
earthy
aromas
come
through
at
first
scent
followed
by
some
citrusy
aromas
there
is
a
slight
taste
of
malt
at
the
beginning
then
the
hops
take
over
from
there
with
some
good
bitterness
and
a
citrus
aftertaste
at
the
end
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
but
leaves
a
nice
dry
finish
at
the
end
this
beer
is
true
to
the
style
immense
hop
flavor
and
aroma
in
a
glass
this
is
a
very
drinkable
malt
dominated
ipa
which
is
a
change
from
most
hop
accented
american
ipas
it
is
surprising
that
this
ale
is
about
6
percent
abv
given
the
light
flavor
a
good
warm
weather
choice
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
hoppy
ipa
you
may
want
to
pass
on
this
one
i
really
enjoy
what
i
have
had
from
goose
island
my
previous
review
of
the
honker
is
probably
too
high
for
what
it
is
overall
opinion
is
that
goose
island
as
a
whole
has
some
very
very
decent
brew
but
could
easily
reach
the
next
tier
maybe
i
need
to
sample
more
of
their
offerings
d
this
ones
easy
to
drink
but
onell
do
good
stuff
recommended
overall
a
pretty
good
ipa
i
tend
to
like
them
to
be
a
bit
more
hoppy
but
this
was
nice
for
a
change
and
a
more
subtle
flavor
dcertainly
solid
but
not
a
wowzer
for
me
i
like
it
just
fine
but
doubt
i
would
find
myself
reaching
for
it
often
something
simply
does
not
click
for
me
d
i
can
drink
this
for
a
long
time
i
will
definitely
buy
a
sixer
next
time
im
looking
for
something
familiar
decent
ipa
yes
ill
have
another
d
yep
this
is
drinkable
d
so
full
of
fruity
flavors
its
hard
to
put
her
down
bitterness
is
a
bitch
though
and
for
a
session
id
have
to
move
on
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
ipas
still
holds
up
as
well
as
anything
ive
had
slight
haze
on
an
orange
golden
haystack
with
a
fine
assed
and
fuzzy
white
lid
sexy
nose
lemon
zest
orange
and
grapefruit
entice
as
spicy
grassy
hops
mingle
with
sweet
floral
and
pale
mat
aromas
the
medium
body
displays
buzzingly
fine
creamy
carbonation
that
tickles
the
tongue
with
a
perfect
amount
of
sharp
bitterness
the
fresh
citric
fruit
and
rind
bitterness
flow
straight
through
to
the
finish
the
pale
floral
sweetness
is
subtle
but
definitely
adds
to
the
brew
earthy
spice
shows
up
and
joins
the
bitter
finish
i
find
this
an
excellent
offering
that
even
the
nonipa
fans
could
enjoy
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
i
love
that
this
beer
is
not
bitter
at
all
but
it
is
obvious
there
are
plenty
of
hops
and
it
is
well
balanced
with
a
good
dose
of
malt
recommended
of
the
ipas
i
have
sampled
this
was
definitely
one
of
the
best
overall
it
was
highly
flavorful
ridiculously
drinkable
and
it
paired
perfectly
with
my
crab
and
shrimp
stuffed
salmon
tasted
on
21208
excellent
and
a
terrific
accompaniment
to
my
butter
and
garlic
tilapia
pours
a
light
orangeamber
color
with
decent
head
and
lacing
has
a
very
strong
floral
scent
that
covers
up
any
bitter
or
sweet
scent
for
the
most
part
decent
taste
again
its
very
floral
too
much
so
but
it
does
have
a
nice
bitter
aftertaste
goes
down
fine
while
i
love
goose
islands
oatmeal
stout
the
ipa
just
isnt
the
best
mostly
transluscent
honey
colored
pour
with
a
nice
whitish
head
smell
is
mildly
hopped
with
some
sweetness
showing
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
somewhat
mild
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
with
a
smooth
creamy
tart
sweetness
following
almost
more
american
pale
like
to
me
but
it
makes
for
a
very
nice
drinkable
ipa
a
bit
unique
and
friendly
at
the
same
time
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
not
the
best
gi
product
but
it
still
worth
a
try
this
is
a
great
american
ipa
poured
a
hazy
copper
with
a
nice
full
head
that
disappeared
but
left
consistent
lacing
throughout
the
drink
its
nose
was
full
of
citrus
and
pine
the
hops
just
cut
right
through
it
the
taste
was
full
of
hops
but
had
a
nice
balance
of
citrus
and
woodiness
this
beer
was
easy
to
drink
had
a
great
mouthfeel
and
went
wonderful
with
the
ribs
i
ate
goose
island
is
a
great
brewery
and
this
beer
carries
on
the
tradition
not
the
best
nor
the
worst
but
definitely
a
pleasant
drinker
wish
i
could
have
these
around
here
on
the
east
coast
more
often
overall
impression
a
nice
ipa
nothing
extreme
fairly
mellow
but
with
lots
of
complex
hop
flavors
a
nice
beer
this
is
about
the
only
americanstyle
ipa
i
can
find
when
traveling
in
downstate
illinois
while
its
nowhere
close
my
local
favorite
like
racer
5
or
even
socal
guys
like
ballast
point
or
green
flash
goose
islands
ipa
is
a
respectable
and
enjoyable
rendition
that
im
happy
to
get
more
of
pours
a
slightly
clouded
amber
with
a
creme
head
that
doesnt
really
stick
around
but
leaves
lots
of
evidence
that
means
lace
on
the
way
down
nose
is
very
piney
and
sticky
hops
seems
a
bit
salty
as
well
flavor
is
hoppy
of
course
tangy
tones
rule
on
this
one
minor
bitter
hop
edge
is
there
as
well
feel
is
nice
this
is
a
smooth
and
well
balanced
ipa
id
love
to
see
a
cask
offering
pours
a
clean
golden
yellow
with
orangeish
hints
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
grapefruity
hops
in
the
taste
hoppy
and
a
light
malt
to
back
it
up
a
small
bitter
and
lighter
body
mouthfeel
and
a
small
grapefruity
hop
aftertaste
great
everyday
ipa
kind
of
light
but
a
nice
balance
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
ale
poured
cloudy
too
much
chill
haze
for
my
tastes
decent
head
and
lacing
very
neutral
aroma
for
an
ipa
the
body
and
mouthfeel
were
average
pretty
firm
malt
base
however
the
taste
was
dominated
by
cascade
hops
the
malt
sweetness
and
citrus
taste
of
the
cascades
gave
this
ale
a
definite
american
ipa
feel
ive
grown
rather
tired
of
cascades
in
this
case
i
think
it
was
overdone
i
must
admit
being
a
bit
underwhelmed
on
this
one
i
would
think
the
ipa
would
be
more
towards
the
alpha
acid
side
a
good
beer
as
a
safe
choice
when
there
is
nothing
else
around
poured
a
nice
attractive
orangeamber
color
with
decent
white
head
that
stayed
for
a
while
the
aroma
was
was
of
citrus
fruit
the
taste
was
hoppy
but
wellbalanced
by
the
maltiness
the
mouthfeel
was
good
and
the
drinkability
of
this
ipa
was
way
up
there
i
liked
solid
quencher
from
start
to
finish
ill
be
getting
more
of
these
for
trips
out
to
the
lake
in
the
summer
d
the
alcohol
content
may
catch
up
with
me
if
i
put
back
a
few
of
these
by
the
end
of
the
glass
im
getting
a
little
overwhelmed
by
the
hops
d
very
nice
american
ipa
this
is
perhaps
one
of
the
better
goose
island
beers
ive
had
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
white
pillowy
head
that
so
slowly
dies
down
smell
is
citrusy
and
piney
hops
and
not
much
else
taste
is
strong
on
citrus
as
well
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
plenty
of
nice
carbonation
makes
this
one
a
strong
ipa
not
the
best
offering
from
goose
island
but
a
solid
beer
i
like
this
beer
for
what
it
is
its
not
trying
to
be
over
the
top
with
citrus
hops
and
bitterness
but
a
well
balanced
beer
and
well
crafted
i
hope
to
drink
this
more
often
great
ipa
i
would
say
its
closer
to
an
english
version
perfectly
drinkable
and
it
wont
ruin
the
palate
give
this
one
a
shot
edit
flavor
stands
up
to
the
hottest
salsa
just
thought
someone
might
want
to
know
that
overall
its
a
great
american
ipa
color
here
is
a
light
amber
with
a
pretty
thin
and
quickly
disintegrating
head
can
smell
a
good
bit
of
hops
coming
off
of
it
with
a
fresh
pine
and
cut
grass
smell
to
it
taste
at
first
is
rather
smooth
and
then
get
hit
with
a
sharp
bitter
pine
hop
taste
that
is
throughly
enjoyable
and
is
offset
a
bit
by
a
sweeter
malt
that
comes
later
in
the
tasting
pretty
nice
for
a
simple
ipa
imo
the
carbonation
is
pretty
good
with
the
hops
and
the
only
thing
i
dont
really
care
for
is
that
in
the
after
taste
seems
to
leave
a
bit
of
a
weird
film
in
my
mouth
which
just
feels
odd
taste
is
hoppy
and
has
some
strong
citric
notes
the
beer
is
not
extremely
bitter
but
is
medium
bitter
when
compared
to
ipa
standards
the
beer
is
not
as
bitter
as
i
expected
and
hoped
for
body
is
medium
and
for
my
liking
could
have
been
a
bit
thicker
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
the
ipa
novice
12
ounce

served
in
a
sam
adams
bl
glass
the
beer
pours
a
honeyorange
color
with
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
nice
clean
aroma
of
citrusygrapefruit
hops
and
a
bit
of
floral
hops
too
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
as
far
as
the
hops
go
but
theres
also
some
spice
and
matly
sweetness
noticable
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
its
smooth
and
leaves
a
slight
coating
on
my
tongue
drinkability
is
good
its
a
nice
refreshing
ipa
thats
quite
sessionable
not
a
bad
choice
at
all
this
beers
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
active
white
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
the
smell
is
fruity
and
hoppy
initial
flavor
is
of
hops
and
carbonation
but
has
a
bit
of
spice
to
it
as
well
finishes
smooth
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
this
is
a
good
summertime
beer
maybe
the
best
ipa
ive
had
overall
a
little
too
light
but
another
easily
drinkable
beer
by
gi
4s
across
the
board
solid
and
tasty
ipa
and
who
gives
a
damn
if
theyre
affiliated
with
ab
or
not
good
beer
is
good
beer
i
dont
know
why
thats
even
listed
under
brewery
notes
who
cares
anyway
this
is
a
nice
ipa
that
i
would
definitely
have
again
good
beer
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
will
drink
again
the
taste
is
balanced
fairly
pronounced
hops
bitterness
with
a
hint
of
malt
in
the
finish
the
beer
is
crisp
but
overall
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
i
was
expecting
the
thinness
to
fade
as
the
tongue
got
coated
but
this
did
not
happen
drinkability
is
good
between
the
5
9
abv
and
pleasant
taste
i
could
see
this
as
sessionable
overall
a
pretty
average
ipa
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
i
enjoy
ipas
and
this
one
is
very
good
d
enough
hop
character
to
maintain
its
identitty
yet
little
enough
to
make
this
one
a
great
candidate
for
session
drinking
an
excellent
everyday
beer
tastebuds
warm
up
to
the
hops
right
away
one
of
the
few
ipas
that
i
could
make
a
session
beer
which
may
or
may
not
be
a
good
thing
g
i
plays
it
safe
with
this
one
for
maltmouths
like
me
im
dissapointed
that
it
isnt
more
experimental
but
happy
that
i
can
have
more
than
one
without
my
taste
buds
jumping
out
of
my
mouth
and
looking
for
a
fire
extinguisher
a
great
ipa
from
goose
island
that
to
me
seems
very
underrated
i
have
sampled
bottles
in
the
past
and
they
werent
quite
as
vibrant
as
the
fresh
tapped
version
ddamn
fine
brew
i
wish
i
had
more
overall
not
my
favorite
ipa
for
sure
a
fair
brew
though
with
a
different
hop
balance
than
others
ive
tried
drinkability
despite
the
powerful
taste
a
very
juicy
and
refreshing
beer
an
adipa
all
day
ipa
this
one
is
very
easy
to
throw
several
back
not
one
of
the
best
ive
had
but
no
slouch
either
try
it
youll
like
it
i
found
this
ipa
to
be
very
average
it
smelled
a
bit
hoppy
but
the
taste
was
a
not
very
exciting
balance
of
hops
and
more
maltiness
than
i
expected
still
this
isnt
really
a
flavorpacked
ipa
and
maybe
more
extreme
ipas
apas
and
dipas
have
made
too
cynical
for
this
beer
yet
it
also
didnt
seem
to
be
an
englishstyle
ipabitter
i
also
found
it
to
be
a
bit
watery
in
mouthfeel
not
quite
sure
what
drawer
to
put
this
beer
in
in
my
mind
which
combined
with
uninspiring
messages
from
my
taste
buds
left
me
feeling
a
bit
unsatisfied

beige
color
ale
with
a
nice
foamy
head
and
good
retention
aroma
of
bitter
and
floral
hops
is
dominating
and
quite
enjoyable
taste
is
a
nice
mix
between
some
caramel
malt
with
some
floral
hops
and
a
medium
bitter
finish
good
carbonation
with
full
body
and
well
balance
for
the
style
d
a
session
ipa
if
there
ever
was
one
very
easy
drinking
another
please
while
in
chicago
i
tried
a
bottle
of
this
during
lunch
at
the
frontera
grill
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
ipas
but
this
one
was
quite
nice
went
great
with
some
spicy
mexican
food
it
poured
a
nice
golden
red
color
and
you
could
definitely
smell
the
hops
the
taste
was
interesting
though
some
ipa
tend
to
be
overly
hoppy
and
almost
hard
to
drink
a
few
this
one
was
just
subtle
enough
to
enjoy
but
still
know
you
are
drinking
an
ipa
the
middle
ground
with
hops
is
what
i
enjoy
and
this
one
hits
the
spot
an
excellent
example
overall
this
was
a
tight
little
ipa
nothing
to
scream
about
and
there
are
actually
some
local
ones
that
i
can
get
that
i
actually
find
a
bit
tastier
again
not
to
say
that
this
was
bad
just
not
really
impressed
with
it
overall
i
would
not
turn
it
down
if
it
was
offered
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
still
worth
a
try
though
served
in
a
house
ipa
glass
at
the
clybourn
brewpub
the
beer
was
served
a
nice
amber
with
a
decent
semilasting
head
the
aroma
was
a
decent
blend
of
citrus
hops
against
some
sweet
malts
the
beer
was
a
good
hop
blend
that
leaned
on
the
citrus
side
that
just
slightly
overpowered
the
sweet
malt
backbone
the
beer
was
crisp
and
refreshing
just
slightly
light
for
the
style
for
the
most
part
this
is
an
enjoyable
ipa
but
far
from
the
top
of
my
list
immediately
one
of
my
favorites
its
missing
just
a
tad
of
the
depth
of
two
hearted
to
my
taste
or
maybe
thats
just
me
in
this
moment
im
looking
for
this
as
much
as
i
am
that
when
im
in
the
midwest
from
now
on
mouthfeel
is
medium
good
carbonation
overall
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
consider
it
a
session
beer
although
i
tend
to
get
drunk
after
6
t
very
balanced
a
little
bitter
and
and
sweet
good
i
liked
it
what
more
can
i
say
there
was
not
a
lot
of
depth
but
it
had
great
character
and
was
extremely
easy
to
drink
definatly
a
ood
beer
drinkability
is
okay
but
why
this
is
an
ipa
it
should
rattle
your
teeth
a
bit
more
but
it
doesnt
one
more
pretty
nice
above
average
beer
from
a
pretty
nice
above
average
brewery
i
could
have
several
of
these
any
day
of
the
week
not
cloying

a

although
its
not

id
drink
it
no

but
i
think
id
go
to
other
ipas
if
they
were

up

this
is
definitly
a
good
beer
even
in
the

feels
thick

i
wont

d
a

one
that
i
would
reach
for
when
i
need
to
get
my
hop
fix
overall
an
outstanding
testament
to
the
style
and
a
must
try
excellent
beer
with
great
balance
highly
drinkable
among
the
best
ipas
ive
ever
had
taste
is
of
carmelized
hops
with
a
bready
note
some
sweetness
to
the
beer
but
its
counteracted
by
a
wellplaced
bitter
hoppy
finish
the
body
of
gooses
ipa
is
medium
to
light
crisp
and
it
has
an
average
amount
of
carbonation
easily
drinkable
and
tasty
but
a
bit
onesided
to
be
classified
as
a
standout
ipa
i
did
manage
however
to
polish
off
3
of
these
in
one
night
and
i
couldve
easily
had
3
more
solid
brewing
from
chitown
when
i
first
had
goose
beers
as
a
youngster
and
had
only
drunk
macros
and
malt
liquor
this
left
a
soapy
aftertaste
fortunately
after
being
opened
up
to
craft
brews
i
sensed
this
one
quite
differently
this
looks
like
your
typical
ipa
light
amber
in
color
typical
head
for
the
style
the
aroma
is
more
dominant
of
pine
with
some
floral
notes
they
are
not
using
the
citrusy
hops
here
which
i
now
am
in
love
with
though
a
little
caramel
malt
sweetness
upfront
is
quickly
taken
over
by
the
bittering
hops
this
was
my
first
ipa
after
being
enlightened
and
it
left
me
wanting
more
i
finally
got
the
hops
thing
i
finally
got
the
piney
bitterness
rather
than
soapy
flavors
i
imagined
before
i
was
used
to
hops
medium
in
body
long
finish
an
overall
decent
ipa
taste
is
very
mellow
and
leans
towards
the
malt
in
a
big
way
crackery
malt
with
some
bready
baking
notes
caramel
vanilla
whatever
hop
flavour
there
is
here
its
mostly
a
herbal
hop
character
with
a
bit
of
floweriness
theres
an
interesting
flavour
in
the
finish
that
is
very
green
and
reminds
me
of
eating
peas
in
the
pod
right
off
the
vine
little
in
the
way
of
and
ipa
character
here
its
more
of
a
jazzier
apa
mouthfeel
is
mild
on
the
carbonation
and
isnt
nearly
as
dry
as
id
expect
its
easy
drinking
but
besides
the
aroma
this
beer
has
very
little
of
the
things
that
ive
come
to
love
in
an
american
ipa
drinkability
is
great
well
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
a
pretty
good
ipa
and
another
great
beer
from
goose
island
ive
yet
tasted
a
bad
beer
from
gi
nice
mouthfeel
and
nice
drinkability
an
easy
beer
to
make
a
session
out
of
ole
rog
must
think
the
cubbies
are
gonna
win
the
world
series
too
still
goose
island
is
a
noble
brew
and
i
think
they
would
agree
too
d
there
are
so
many
better
offerings
out
there
i
had
higher
expectations
for
this
all
i
can
think
of
about
this
beer
is
so
what
not
too
bad
a
brew
at
all
i
will
definitely
hit
these
here
and
there
it
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
purchased
at
corner
store
bottle
stated
best
when
consumed
by
8
19
07
chilled
and
poured
into
a
nonic
despite
the
suggestion
of
a
tulip
glass
as
specified
on
the
label
nice
two
fingers
of
grayish
white
head
which
dissipated
at
a
medium
pace
and
lingers
little
more
than
a
centimeter
off
the
surface
leaving
slightly
thin
lacing
the
body
is
a
very
light
amber
color
with
a
slight
hint
of
peach
and
blond
straw
colored
highlights
the
body
is
translucent
with
decent
clarity
smell
is
spicy
hops
up
front
slightly
piney
big
notes
of
grass
and
earth
with
a
subdued
malt
character
i
get
small
hints
of
butterscotch
and
strawberry
not
sure
if
this
is
strictly
from
the
malt
though
taste
wise
the
bitterness
is
not
quite
as
assertive
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
but
in
terms
of
balance
it
is
quite
adequate
personally
i
might
want
a
slightly
more
strong
malt
character
alcohol
to
allow
for
bigger
hop
function
but
as
i
said
before
it
is
well
balanced
i
guess
ive
become
so
accustomed
to
what
id
consider
to
be
american
style
ipa
where
i
feel
this
is
more
an
english
style
there
is
no
question
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ipa
the
alcohol
is
low
enough
to
make
this
very
sessionable
not
my
favorite
but
definitely
a
solid
offering
eric
tastes
pretty
good
but
a
little
bitter
i
normally
like
hops
i
remember
liking
this
beer
more
than
i
do
now
it
does
have
a
good
mouthfeel
as
the
taste
buds
acclimate
to
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
tasty
hoppy
ipa
quite
a
good
one
i
think
overall
not
a
bad
ipa
nothing
about
this
beer
really
stands
out
to
me
and
amazes
me
but
it
is
what
it
says
it
is
no
fancy
names
just
india
pale
ale
thats
what
it
says
and
thats
what
you
get
a
very
drinkable
beer
pours
dark
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
a
bit
of
a
head
some
lacing
remains
after
the
beer
is
gone
comparable
to
english
bitters
the
most
noticeable
thing
is
the
floral
smell
of
dry
hops
which
is
not
overdone
and
very
enticing
taste
is
sweet
at
first
giving
way
to
citrus
flavors
lingering
hop
bitterness
and
the
floral
elements
noticed
in
the
smell
mouthfeel
is
nice
since
the
beer
is
not
overly
carbonated
and
is
very
thick
the
hops
are
strong
enough
that
this
is
firmly
an
ipa
but
they
do
not
dominate
the
malt
characters
a
balanced
sessionable
ipa
it
pours
a
strong
dark
yellow
almost
aproaching
amber
with
a
samll
head
that
goes
quickly
and
some
lacing
left
consistently
very
fruity
and
sweet
aroma
as
well
as
spciy
with
hops
ver
very
present
and
accounted
for
earthy
and
flowery
smell
as
well
taste
begins
smooth
and
with
some
maltiness
and
ends
perfectly
with
a
strong
hop
induced
bitterness
and
some
flowery
undertones
that
linger
on
well
after
the
first
sip
a
truly
inspiring
beer
a
very
refreshing
well
balanced
ipa
over
all
a
great
example
of
what
an
ipa
is
so
what
gives
has
ab
pulled
ipa
from
the
shelves
in
midmissouri
so
it
can
peddle
its
own
weak
pale
ale
with
the

is
overwhelming
hops
very
strong
aroma
taste
starts
bitter
than
envelops
you
with
a
sugary
sweetness
and
then
the
hops
come
back
in
for
a
bitter
bite
as
it
goes
down
finish
is
a
little
cloying
definitely
gets
better
closer
to

than

temperature
very
drinkable
ipa
up
there
with
bells
two
hearted
for
very
sessionable
ipas
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
its
light
but
full
of
flavor
you
really
get
the
taste
and
smell
of
fresh
hops
and
citrus
whenever
you
take
a
sip
its
a
great
golden
color
with
a
fairly
decent
2
finger
head
not
bad
for
an
ipa
all
in
all
i
would
highly
recommend
trying
this
beer
especially
on
tap
the
beer
that
converted
me
into
a
hop
head
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
this
ale
pours
a
vibrant
copper
hue
with
a
nice
head
that
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lace
as
the
beer
is
consumed
smell
is
piney
hops
with
some
floral
notes
taste
is
intense
hops
the
pine
and
floral
are
there
in
subdued
fashion
mouthfeel
is
a
dry
and
crisp
but
seems
to
demolisht
my
palate
like
a
dipa
one
of
the
my
favorite
ipas
to
drink
another
solid
goose
island
offering
a
fine
and
extremely
accessable
ipa
here
and
its
affordability
is
a
big
plus
as
well
reccomended
d
this
is
a
very
good
american
ipa
another
great
gi
product
this
easytodrink
ipa
is
a
great
little
session
beer
and
another
fine
product
from
goose
island
i
enjoyed
this
one
its
full
of
flavour
and
easy
drinking
a
nice
introduction
to
the
brewery
overall
as
its
got
me
wanting
to
try
more
of
their
stuff
very
slight
citrus
almost
grapefruit
aftertaste
the
beer
pours
out
a
big
frothy
head
that
lasts
until
the
end
of
the
beer
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
a
little
of
for
some
reason
the
taste
is
very
hoppy
with
some
grassyfruity
hops
put
together
to
make
a
very
good
mix
that
balances
between
too
citrissy
and
too
grassy
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
smooth
with
a
slight
carbonation
that
isnt
bad
on
the
palate
overall
i
liked
this
beer
and
will
be
having
more
of
it
pours
a
deep
reddish
golden
brown
with
a
slight
head
on
it
smells
great
as
the
hops
release
a
bouquet
of
bitterness
and
spicyness
tastes
good
but
isnt
as
strong
of
a
hopness
as
expected
with
an
ipa
i
was
kinda
dissapointed
expecting
an
overpowering
amount
of
hops
tasted
more
like
a
pale
ale
than
an
ipa
but
it
was
still
a
great
beer
i
hope
i
can
find
it
on
tap
as
well
as
in
a
bottle
more
often
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
big
over
the
top
hop
flavors
of
pine
floral
and
citrus
though
the
citrus
takes
a
back
seat
there
is
a
very
subtle
malt
presence
the
finish
leaves
your
mouth
extremely
dry
i
dont
know
how
many
of
these
id
have
in
a
row
overall
its
a
solid
if
standard
american
ipa
not
much
here
is
bad
but
not
much
stands
out
either
d
very
good
this
ipa
is
a
fantastic
go
to
beer
and
seems
like
it
was
made
to
compliment
spicy
food
fat
willys
rib
shack
in
chicago
the
spicy
hops
and
roasty
malt
meld
together
excellently
sessionable
d
this
beer
helped
bring
me
to
the
world
of
craft

it
is
as

as
i
first
remember

the

cant
complain
for
the

and
i
will
make
this

up
this

caters
to
both

and
the

this

wont
blow
your

off

its
plenty

reminds
me
off
the
bat
of
wisconsins

as
theres
a
little
biscuity
malt
mixed
in
with
the
hops

another
great
beer
from
gi
thanks
to
jhammerly
and
buckeyenation
for
the
trades
d
this
is
a
very
well
made
ipa
the
hops
are
there
but
are
at
just
the
right
level
to
make
this
the
closest
thing
to
a
session
ipa
without
it
being
a
regular
pale
ale
this
offering
from
goose
island
pours
a
foggy
dirty
blonde
that
leaves
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
leaves
a
sticky
residue
that
stays
with
this
head
the
aroma
is
honey
hops
citrus
earthy
west
coast
feel
to
this
ipa
the
taste
actually
starts
malty
sweet
folllowed
by
healthy
dose
of
bitterness
as
not
to
forget
this
is
a
ipa
this
ipa
continues
to
take
your
palate
on
a
herbal
honey
tea
ride
and
the
finish
is
very
nice
this
is
a
quality
ipa
if
it
were
distributed
around
here
i
would
have
this
in
my
fridge
all
year
drinkability
is
also
very
good
this
might
be
weird
to
say
but
the
only
complaint
i
have
is
that
everything
about
the
beer
is
too
middleoftheroad
it
has
a
predominant
pine
hop
flavor
but
not
too
much
with
secondary
flavors
being
too
low
on
the
list
to
register
there
isnt
much
to
distinguish
this
beer
from
others
im
sure
the
problem
here
is
just
that
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
ipas
and
enjoy
finding
resonating
flavors
to
perk
up
my
interest
so
it
is
only
a
quible
an
extremely
smooth
mellow
beer
i
just
wish
it
was
more
refreshing
d
very
good
beer
to
drink
by
itself
and
paired
nicely
with
some
good
pizza
as
well
not
the
absolute
best
ipa
i
have
ever
had
but
certainly
a
solid
choice
if
you
see
it
give
it
a
shot
drinkability
is
ok
ill
go
for
this
ale
again
and
ill
try
to
make
sure
i
get
it
fresher
for
best
enjoyment
let
beer
warm
slightly
above
fridge
temp
cheers
a
very
drinkable
ipa
with
enough
offered
to
ensure
future
purchases
this
beer
is
an
above
average
ipa
this
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
the
beer
was
a
lighter
orange
with
a
fair
head
there
was
a
little
lacing
the
smell
was
hoppy
and
the
taste
was
predominatly
hops
as
well
there
was
a
lasting
bitterness
common
with
the
style
i
could
drink
this
beer
again
overall
a
nice
session
ipa
that
i
would
probably
drink
often
if
it
was
available
to
me
will
be
having
a
few
of
these
later
on
today
and
then
bragging
about
the
special
purchase
of

thanks
jimi
d
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
especially
if
youre
into
hops
its
not
over
the
top
hoppy
but
i
think
its
a
nice
version
of
an
ipa
and
one
that
i
could
see
myself
sessioning
the
flavor
is
first
most
a
hopsack
backed
by
a
firm
chunk
of
malt
the
body
is
not
to
heavy
or
carmelized
lingering
citrus
flavor
sticks
with
you
long
after
the
beer
is
gone
also
not
like
it
made
a
difference
in
my
testing
the
bottle
was
well
done
in
that
not
only
did
it
show
the
bestbydate
but
it
also
showed
what
glass
it
should
be
served
in
now
thats
classy
in
total
a
good
ipa
and
one
i
would
drink
again
not
the
top
shelf
however
opinion
i
think
that
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
if
am
ipas
and
this
is
no
exception
i
respect
that
the
finish
isnt
chalky
like
so
many
of
them
are
when
the
idiom
is
use
more
gypsum
it
is
a
clean
and
well
crafted
beer
just
the
same
i
just
wont
be
partaking
in
it
that
often
nicely
smooth
and
chewy
bursting
with
vibrant
fresh
grapefruit
flavor
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
a
very
respectable
ipa
the
bartender
tapped
the
hazy
amber
beverage
into
a
pint
glass
floral
hops
dominate
the
aroma
with
some
grain
in
the
background
tastewise
it
has
less
hoppy
than
i
expected
but
very
well
balanced
the
malt
character
rounded
out
the
pine
bitterness
and
finished
it
with
crispness
not
knowing
too
many
bars
around
the
area
this
was
a
great
bet
and
this
was
the
finest
of
the
beers
that
i
tried
this
one
is
full
bodied
and
solid
carbonation
is
decent
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
although
for
me
any
highly
hopped
beer
gets
a
little
overwhelmig
after
one
or
two
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
too
bitter
and
biting
but
other
than
that
i
love
this
beer
not
a
bad
brew
i
could
drink
a
few
more
but
i
think
there
are
better
on
the
market

characteristics

see
in

goose

a
slightly
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
head
had
good
retention
and
left
some
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
citrusy
hops
the
taste
was
also
heavy
on
the
hops
from
the
beginning
all
the
way
to
the
lightly
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
good
a
medium

with
medium
carbonation
the
drinkabality
was
great
the
good

and
light
bitterness
just
made
me
want

that
i
can
actually
find

overall
a

good

the

not

hop
twang
is

a

makes
this
one
to
enjoy
again
and
again
i
modified
some
of
my
original
ratings
to
reflect
my
latest
sample
highly
recommended
d
highly
drinkable
i
could
drink
these
all
night
long
a
great
session
ipa
as
the
abv
is
quite
low
goose
island
has
great
offerings
probably
not
extreme
enough
for
some
hopheads
but
this
is
textbook
ipa
nice
product
by
goose
island
appearance
is
a
cloudy
super
carbonated
dull
amber
with
little
head
nose
is
very
roasted
for
an
ipa
with
little
hops
apparent
taste
is
ok
with
hops
up
front
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
at
first
with
some
malt
finish
i
was
not
impressed
by
this
one
hopefully
a
bad
bottle
in
which
i
have
more
off
which
i
will
review
if
better
a
decent
ipa
with
subtle
flavoring
give
this
one
to
your
pals
that
arent
all
about
the
hops
and
it
will
be
enjoyed
the
appearance
is
golden
to
pale
in
color
and
brilliantly
clear
with
a
strong
long
lasting
white
head
the
flavor
is
malty
and
well
balanced
with
a
nice
dose
of
hops
this
high
gravity
beer
hides
its
alcohol
well
and
has
a
nice
bitter
finish
also
it
is
medium
bodied
and
appropriately
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
classic
example
of
an
americanized
ipa
british
ipa
fans
will
be
disappointed
with
this
beers
american
hop
profile
this
beer
is
great
straight
from
goose
islands
tap
pours
a
nice
nectar
orange
with
a
head
that
settles
nicely
as
the
session
progresses
the
aroma
is
of
pungent
hops
and
citrus
berry
a
hint
of
honey
will
stick
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
smooth
with
a
nice
hit
of
the
hop
character
to
balance
the
sweet
nectar
honey
very
nice
offering
could
drink
this
again
the
taste
left
something
to
be
desired
as
it
didnt
seem
quite
as
hoppy
as
it
did
in
the
smell
the
malt
base
is
a
little
dull
somewhat
biscuity
with
subdued
hops
on
top
of
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
and
its
less
than
assertive
after
having
a
few
bottles
of
this
beer
over
the
last
few
days
i
decided
to
rate
this
ffrom
the
bottle
poured
copper
with
a
nice
off
white
head
with
some
lacin
aroma
a
nice
sweet
hoppness
comes
out
first
than
caramel
orange
some
floral
flavor
a
dry
hop
spicey
some
malts
sneak
out
couldnt
get
the
sweetness
or
caramel
i
got
in
the
aroma
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
better
ipas
i
have
had
from
a
bottle
no
harshness
just
a
nice
smooth
beer
glad
i
picked
up
a
6er
bad
thing
is
i
am
drinking
my
last
bottle
have
to
get
more
mouthfeel
is
hoppily
spiced
and
sweet
at
the
front
of
the
tongue
leading
to
a
medium
bodied
balanced
brew
pours
out
with
a
slim
head
fast
dissipation
color
is
deep
gold
light
copper
very
clear
aroma
of
tangy
grassy
hops
comes
through
but
could
be
stronger
the
taste
has
nutty
caramel
malt
undertones
to
match
the
nice
hop
flavor
solid
bitter
finish
with
a
slight
roasted
character
and
spiciness
mouthfeel
is
light
but
avoids
being
watery
adequate
carbonation
solid
ipa
with
a
good
malt
flavor
for
balance
definitely
not
an
explosion
of
hops
if
thats
what
you
are
looking
for
but
nice
indeed
this
is
a
great
beer
a
real
treat
at
the
end
of
a
hot
day
probably
too
rich
for
most
to
enjoy
more
than
a
couple
in
one
sitting
but
definately
allows
for
quality
over
quantity
it
is
by
far
and
away
my
favorite
american
single
ipa
and
ive
had
more
than
a
few
in
this
style
this
beer
has
turned
me
back
on
to
goose
island
after
being
silly
enough
to
take
the
claim
on
their
oatmeal
stout
bottle
seriously
that
it
would
make
me
forget
all
other
oatmeal
stouts
it
didnt
but
this
ipa
has
made
all
the
others
ive
tried
a
whole
lot
less
memorable
hopheads
are
likely
to
disappointed
but
i
like
ipas
with
some
malty
balance
which
this
one
has
a
good
beer
to
introduce
someone
to
the
style
drinkabilityoverall
with
a
welltraveled
palate
i
can
easily
recognize
this
as
a
balanced
wellmade
ipa
big
juicy
and
imminently
drinkable
six
pack
was
purchased
in
package
store
in
omaha
and
consumed
in
dallas
light
amber
color
with
some
haziness
medium
white
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
but
still
left
lacing
on
glass
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
hop
character
in
both
aroma
and
taste
doesnt
knock
your
socks
off
with
hop
utilization
like
many
american
ipas
try
to
maltiness
is
nicely
balanced
with
hops
everything
in
this
beer
has
been
done
in
moderation
and
the
result
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
will
stock
up
on
it
whenever
possible
body
is
medium
creamy
and
very
easy
to
enjoy
by
buddy
brought
me
back
a
few
of
these
from
chi
i
will
enjoy
them
a
decent
ipa
but
nothing
too
special
since
i
like
hoppy
beers
this
is
a
little
lower
by
my
ranking
but
this
is
an
ok
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
thats
looks
a
little
different
than
the
picture
above
presents
itself
as
a
medium
gold
color
with
a
rocky
white
head
that
stands
tall
lots
of
lacing
in
the
pint
glass
nose
is
of
citrusy
hops
piney
and
somewhat
sweet
palate
is
a
very
good
balance
of
hop
astringency
and
malty
sweetness
definitely
an
ipa
in
that
it
leans
heavily
toward
the
hop
presence
but
isnt
overpowering
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
some
lingering
sweetness
on
the
tongue
to
me
this
is
a
great
standard
american
style
ipa
very
very
drinkable
this
one
is
one
of
my
staple
beers
that
i
like
to
have
on
hand
at
all
times
doesnt
challenge
you
but
always
satisfies
the
thirst
for
a
good
hoppy
ipa
recommended
drinkability
light
body
good
hoppiness
and
mid
level
alcohol
make
it
a
pretty
easy
drinker
notes
a
good
ipa
that
is
well
worth
your
time
light
mouthfeel
easy
drinking
despite
the
metallic
taste
d
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
special
very
enjoyable
ipa
one
of
the
tops
in
my
book
purchased
from
consumers
beverage
center
on
elmwood
in
kenmore
but
they
have
them
at
a
couple
other
locations
too
12ounce
twistoff
bottle
says
to
pour
into
a
tulip
glass
i
dont
have
one
so
this
went
into
a
17ounce
snifter
orange
amber
with
a
sticky
white
head
plenty
of
lacing
even
after
the
foam
settles
to
a
thin
cover
nose
is
appropriately
floral
citric
and
piney
with
a
bit
of
underlying
caramel
malt
sweetness
there
is
however
very
little
sweetness
to
speak
of
in
the
taste
rather
there
is
a
bitter
pine
and
grapefruit
pith
flavor
up
front
with
a
toasted
biscuit
finish
no
mineral
content
hops
are
right
there
the
whole
way
through
clean
snappy
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
body
not
too
juicy
and
just
dry
enough
much
better
than
i
expected
im
happy
were
able
to
get
a
couple
goose
island
beers
here
in
western
new
york
now
this
one
and
the
honkers
ale
but
im
hoping
the
price
will
come
down
a
bit
good
but
not
quite
worth
10
a
sixpack
very
solid
ipa
not
great
but
something
you
can
always
fall
back
on
if
the
store
doesnt
have
what
you
were
really
looking
for
being
in
the
midwest
this
summer
and
having
access
to
goose
island
will
be
nice
and
this
beer
will
definitely
become
a
regular
the
price
is
right
also
to
me
this
is
just
your
runofthemill
ipa
i
guess
thats
what
i
was
expecting
from
goose
island
reliably
good
not
great
beer
originally
from
michigan
kraftbrau
bells
darkhorse
shorts
im
accustomed
to
a
much
hoppier
beer
to
be
labeled
ipa
mouthfeel
is
light
slick
and
vapory
the
intensity
of
this
beer
along
with
a
heavy
feeling
in
the
gut
makes
it
hard
to
rate
drinkability
high
but
i
have
to
since
i
usually
go
for
two
this
beer
rocks
bottom
line
good
solid
ipa
last
swigs
perfect
session
ipa
gets
the
hop
head
satisfaction
in
an
easy
way
pours
copper
with
decent
clarity
two
finger
head
offwhite

creamy
shows
decent
retention
and
many
stubbord
patches
of
lace
fresh
and
hoppy
aroma
citrus
and
grapefruit
with
a
faint
toasted
pale
malt
background
the
pale
malt
is
strong
at
first
sip
then
lost
in
a
sea
of
cascade
centennial
and
chinook
riptides
full
of
hop
flavor
but
the
acidity
is
mild
dry
aftertaste
with
loads
of
oily
bitterness
medium
carbonation
in
a
light
body
accentuate
the
dry
and
bitter
mouthfeel
but
gracefully
fades
and
the
finish
is
mildmannered
the
balance
sways
towards
the
bitter
end
of
the
spectrum
but
west
coast
ipa
fans
will
love
it
drank
very
easy
just
a
little
too
restrained
to
warrant
better

still
a
nice

with
no

this
beer
may
not
be
the
most
well
balanced
but
its
good
tastingand
refreshing
a
winner
very
fine
carbonation
accentuates
the
hops
nicely
extremely
drinkable
and
a
regular
favorite
of
mine
a
classic
u
s
i
p
a
best
before
date
of
9306
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
a
good
well
above
average
ipa
and
would
certainly
have
it
again
i
will
say
though
that
i
did
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
and
its
a
fairly
good
ipa
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
ipa
in
that
it
is
not
too
strong
abv
and
the
hops
character
is
nice
and
pronounced
without
being
overly
bitter
for
those
who
dont
like
a
ton
of
hops
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
hue
topped
by
one
finger
of
creamy
white
head
appealing
zesty
aroma
of
spicy
bitter
american
hops
some
light
malt
and
a
touch
of
citrus
palate
is
mostly
nice
bittering
hops
a
touch
of
light
sweet
malt
and
notes
of
citrus
and
pepper
body
is
nice
pleasant
and
wellcarbonated
if
slightly
foamy
easydrinking
for
such
an
assertivelyhopped
beer
great
on
a
spring
afternoon
this
beer
has
an
extremely
hoppy
aroma
with
a
hint
of
a
fruity
citruslike
smell
served
in
the
correctly
assigned
glass
tulipglass
as
per
the
label
it
has
a
suprisingly
long
head
retention
and
fantastic
visual
appearance
very
drinkable
and
good
with
pastas
and
as
a
summer
beer
drinkability
is
a
definite
goose
island
ipa
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
definitely
hoppy
the
taste
is
also
hoppy
with
some
citrus
notes
i
liked
this
one
quite
a
drinkable
ipa
definitely
worth
a
try
goose
island
is
definitely
making
some
interesting
beers
drinkability
this
goes
down
easy
but
diacetyl
taste
diminishes
this
ale
for
me
very
easy
drinking
brew
and
i
never
finished
one
without
wanting
another
i
liked
this
ipa
because
it
was
on
the
low
end
of
the
highhopped
ipas
call
me
crazy
but
when
i
ask
for
an
ipa
i
dont
want
a
double
ipa
since
this
beer
wasnt
as
bitter
as
other
ipas
it
was
easy
to
down
a
couple
in
a
row
still
it
was
complex
enough
to
keep
me
interested
in
my
pint
glass
the
beer
appeared
a
soft
translucent
orange
in
color
with
rust
colored
hues
throughout
an
eggshell
colored
head
of
medium
size
developed
and
lingered
for
a
bit
leaving
behind
bits
of
lacing
fair
to
medium
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
citrus
grapefruit
butter
and
hard
candy
the
taste
was
quite
hoppy
with
a
strudy
malt
presence
that
gains
strength
in
the
middle
and
continues
on
into
the
finish
somewhat
balanced
but
still
a
hoppy
beer
with
loads
of
citrus
fruit
juicy
flavors
covering
my
mouth
a
bit
slick
in
my
mouth
with
a
nice
refreshing
core
flavorful
and
refreshing
with
considerable
bite
makes
this
a
beer
to
have
repeatedly
overall
this
is
an
inoffensive
ipa
it
is
decent
but
unremarkable
heres
the
thing
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
but
it
didnt
seem
to
have
the
big
body
or
the
large
amount
of
fortifying
hops
that
ive
come
to
expect
in
an
ipa
overall
the
complexity
of
the
beer
makes
it
worthwhile
but
the
flavor
seems
to
be
out
of
joint
in
comparison
to
the
strength
of
the
aroma
d
i
could
sit
down
and
drink
two
in
a
row
with
a
meal
however
i
dont
know
what
that
meal
would
be
dark
gold
color
with
a
white
head
almost
no
carbonation
bubbles
smell
is
classic
american
ipa
nice
pine
and
citrus
notes
taste
falls
a
little
short
of
the
smell
some
pine
but
not
very
big
noticable
bready
malt
flavors
this
has
a
bitter
finish
that
you
would
expect
but
it
is
a
little
on
the
harsh
side
and
i
normally
enjoy
a
nice
bitter
finish
also
a
little
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
overall
a
nice
ipa
but
not
great
i
could
see
drinking
this
if
it
was
readily
available
and
the
price
was
right
edit
i
have
to
add
a
following
glass
with
a
vigorous
pour
yeiled
a
good
head
that
indeed
did
lace
quite
well
so
dont
be
afraid
to
pour
this
this
brew
pours
a
clear
bronze
color
with
ruby
tints
the
head
is
two
fingers
in
height
and
recedes
rather
slowly
into
thick
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
storng
without
being
overpowering
cirtus
hops
dominate
the
nose
but
there
is
some
interesting
and
appealing
earthy
barnyard
funk
in
the
back
ground
the
sip
begins
with
juicy
hop
then
fades
into
some
nice
funk
for
a
split
second
before
morphing
into
a
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
ipa
but
not
quite
great
i
will
certainly
drink
this
again
would
certainly
pick
up
another
if
i
need
a
standard
ipa
but
nothing
im
writing
home
about
a
golden
orangish
color
with
a
white
head
that
is
a
quater
inch
high
developes
piney
and
earty
aromas
come
trhough
at
first
scent
followed
by
some
citrusy
aromas
there
is
a
slight
taste
of
malt
at
the
beginning
then
the
hops
take
over
from
there
with
some
good
bitterness
and
a
citrus
aftertaste
at
the
end
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
but
leaves
a
nice
dry
finish
at
the
end
this
beer
is
true
to
the
style
immense
hop
flavor
and
aroma
in
a
glass
this
ipa
is
maybe
just
a
little
too
full
and
heavy
on
the
tongue
but
it
doesnt
get
out
of
hand
paired
with
the
equally
just
a
little
too
high
carbonation
it
does
bring
the
drinkability
down
a
little
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
english
style
ipa
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
from
a
brewery
that
always
seems
to
hit
things
right
in
the
middle
not
the
best
out
there
but
far
far
from
the
worst
a
nice
beer
to
keep
around
for
fans
of
english
ipas
its
a
nice
enough
ipa
but
nothing
outstanding
in
many
ways
this
is
a
lot
closer
to
an
apa
in
body
and
character
with
just
a
little
more
hopping
good
and
in
some
ways
memorable
but
there
are
a
number
of
nicer
ipas
out
there
da
solid
ipa
would
buy
a
6
pack
to
enjoy
in
a
sitting
drinkability
this
is
a
very
solid
ipa
this
beer
has
remained
in
my
beer
line
up
for
a
long
time
this
is
not
the
hoppiest
ipa
on
the
market
but
you
could
do
far
worse
than
goose
island
overall
a
very
drinkable
ipa
disclaimer
a
fresh
goose
island
ipa
is
sublime
do
not
let
this
review
affect
your
purchasing
or
views
of
that
version
mmmmm
fresh
goose
island
ipa
a
solid
all
around
ipa
if
a
bit
on
the
abrasive
side
drinkability
drinking
multiple
bottles
is
no
problem
again
very
smooth
very
tasty
the
hop
aftertaste
lingers
for
a
while
then
fades
and
leaves
you
wanting
another
drink
notes
as
ive
started
to
review
ive
had
a
difficult
time
reviewing
to
style
and
not
personal
taste
something
that
will
get
easier
with
time
and
experience
well
ipas
are
my
personal
taste
and
this
one
is
right
on
a
great
single
ipa
alone
or
with
food
thanks
to
bditty187
for
this
one
taste
starts
out
with
and
grapefruit
hops
flavor
that
leads
into
a
more
snap
crackle
pop
of
hops
cant
classify
the
hops
bitterness
at
this
particula
point
on
the
tongue
but
its
good
none
the
less
ends
with
the
only
real
notice
of
bread
dough
crystal
malts
in
this
great
ipa
this
beer
is
lightmedium
bodied
on
the
palate
and
resembles
water
in
a
way
the
amount
of
carbonation
is
appropriate
for
the
style
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
it
leaves
the
mouth
feeling
dry
as
well
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
there
are
so
many
better
ipas
on
the
market
why
would
i
buy
one
that
is
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
others
i
would
only
buy
this
again
if
i
was
craving
an
ipa
and
this
was
the
only
one
within
miles
i
expected
more
from
this
beer
when
i
sat
down
to
try
this
i
was
looking
forward
to
a
great
ipa
but
instead
i
only
got
a
mediocre
one
verdict
its
not
an
amazingly
complex
or
dynamic
pale
ale
but
its
a
good
middleoftheroad
beer
all
in
all
an
excellent
ipa
will
drink
more
in
the
future
refreshing
on
the
palate
but
all
bitter
and
hops
a
decent
session
beer
but
not
the
best
of
this
style
touch
of
rosemary
and
grapefruit
on
the
palate
bitter
on
the
backend
with
lingering
effects
i
love
this
beer
i
really
really
wish
i
could
find
it
here
in
ma
my
next
trip
to
the
midwest
will
include
a
case
of
this
stuff
for
future
enjoyment
drinkability
very
easy
drinking
ipa
as
this
can
be
consumed
all
afternoon
this
one
poured
with
a
white
fluffy
head
that
was
disappointingly
a
little
choppy
lacking
consistency
the
color
was
a
nice
golden
bronze
with
a
nose
that
clearly
involves
hops
straight
out
of
the
northwest
certainly
high
citrus
and
grapefruity
notes
are
present
in
the
aroma
its
a
sturdy
mediumbodied
brew
with
a
sharp
hoppy
context
there
is
a
clear
grapefruit
presence
with
a
floral
bouquet
mulling
in
the
background
just
a
tad
of
offsetting
maltiness
serves
as
a
creamy
addition
it
finishes
bitter
and
grainy
dry
thats
more
lemony
and
sweet
then
the
mouthfeel
solid
ipa
on
tap
at
the
clyborne
brew
pub
clear
yellow
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
very
nice
fresh
piney
hop
smell
full
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
grainy
malt
taste
that
is
quickly
overtaken
by
a
tasty
pacnw
hop
flavor
not
overly
bitter
or
harsh
a
good
ipa
here
very
drinkable
ill
remember
this
one
come
next
springsummers
drinking
sessions
md
i
like
the
way
the
lightly
spicy
texture
blends
with
the
mediumstrength
hoppyness
by
american
standards
plus
a
subtly
fizzy
body
the
palate
and
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
just
ideal
as
a
moreish
ipa
not
as
big
thick
and
complex
as
many
more
audacious
american
ipas
but
i
suppose
its
like
a
reasonably
flavoursome
session
beer
in
america
as
is
a
best
bitter
in
britain
nice
id
get
a
6er
of
this
stuff
i
suppose
pours
a
murky
apricot
color
with
your
average
head
lots
of
citrus
in
the
nose
piney
with
a
butterscotch
undertone
definitely
a
westcoast
ipa
the
taste
is
subtler
than
the
smell
and
there
is
an
initial
sweetness
that
morphs
into
the
hoppy
grapefruit
sourness
the
finsih
is
slightly
bready
and
there
is
more
carbonation
than
i
expected
a
good
solid
ipa

nice
head
and
a
golden
beer
with
fine
haze
nose
is
very
hoppy
american
caqracter
and
overall
very
piny
and
citrussyfruity
some
malts
there
in
the
back
but
overall
a
very
green
nose
as
is
taste
that
also
depend
majorly
on
hop
cracter
but
has
a
nice
sweet
malty
touch
and
is
overall
very
refreshing
and
easy
drinkable
fine
but
not
overdone
carbonisation
makes
it
a
very
balanced
ipa
and
gives
it
an
overall
plesant
and
great
mouthfeel
yes
this
is
a
very
fine
brew
and
for
american
standards
very
balanced
brew
btw
not
many
ipas
available
in
the
netherlands
and
very
glad
to
see
this
one
has
arrived
no
big
surprise
here
like
most
ipas
this
is
pretty
neutral
and
not
worth
chasing
down
it
has
real
nice
malty
taste
and
a
good
hop
mix
with
a
touch
of
grapefruit
like
citrus
and
a
spicy
nose
nose
but
it
is
a
little
grassy
good
for
the
local
market
and
i
would
hessitate
to
get
one
if
you
see
it
and
want
a
standard
session
ipa
the
body
is
a
medium
grade
and
good
drinkable
score
i
thought
this
was
a
great
session
ipa
not
a
hop
heads
best
but
still
very
good
this
is
the
first
american
ipa
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
sampling
and
it
is
definitely
hoppier
than
the
englis
versions
ive
tried
very
herbal
tasting
with
notes
of
oak
light
malt
body
and
very
fruity
clean
and
refreshing
but
very
substantial
at
the
same
time
i
think
ive
found
my
ideal
summer
beer
i
too
lazy
to
poor
this
beer
right
now
as
i
would
have
to
was
the
glass
however
i
think
that
every
beer
becomes
baeutiful
if
it
tastes
good
so
it
really
doesnt
matter
recommended
overall
overall
a
pretty
average
to
slightly
above
average
ipa
taste
isnt
overly
complex
great
hop
character
with
hardly
a
balance
in
the
malts
would
make
an
excellent
session
must
try
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
one
and
can
drink
all
night
if
its
more
easily
accessible
to
you
thanks
to
mlh1227
for
the
try
update

the
big
biscuity
hops
are
really
the
story
here
but
its
still
a
wellbalanced
aipa
it
was
nice
when
i
had
it
and
rated
it
in
2005
and
this
2006
vintage
is
more
of
the
same
as
fantome
would
probably
say
youve
come
full
circle
poured
out
to
a
nice
orange
amber
color
with
a
huge
white
foamy
head
and
rings
of
lace
around
the
glass
this
beer
just
looks
good
makes
you
want
it
smell
is
great
aromas
of
hops
spice
herbs
and
citrus
fill
the
nose
taste
is
solid
flavors
of
citrus
dominate
with
a
hoppy
backbone
that
is
supported
by
the
complexity
of
hints
spice
and
light
pine
mouthfeel
was
good
this
wasnt
too
heavy
or
filling
the
way
a
good
pale
ale
should
be
good
level
of
drinkability
this
would
be
a
great
summer
brew
or
even
winter
brew
for
that
matter
there
will
always
be
space
in
my
beer
cellar
for
this
brew
recommended
session
oh
yea
drinkability
on
of
the
better
ipas
from
the
recent
stash
i
brought
back
from
washington
would
purchase
again
if
it
were
available
here
i
remember
having
this
at
the
clyborne
brewery
and
it
wasnt
too
great
it
seems
to
be
much
better
bottled
good
job
goose
uf
nice
head
retention
fantastic
color
aroma
is
possibly
the
highlight
of
this
brew
very
nice
combination
of
malt
and
hops
an
excellent
beer
and
a
bargain
at
6
99
a
six
pack
try
it
if
you
havent
and
throw
a
six
of
the
fresh
stuff
in
the
fridge
if
you
have
and
show
your
uneducated
beer
friends
that
ipas
can
be
simple
and
not
palate
assaulting
pours
a
nice
clear
copper
color
with
a
bubbling
3
finger
head
that
slowly
falls
but
never
departs
the
nose
is
very
nice
a
balance
between
spicey
fruity
sweet
hop
and
caramel
malt
base
i
like
the
hop
profile
on
this
not
too
strong
in
any
one
direction
but
with
a
lot
going
on
in
it
flavor
is
not
as
nice
as
the
nose
the
hop
is
mostly
spicey
to
a
touch
earthy
over
top
a
solid
caramel
base
good
balance
but
not
popping
enough
in
the
hop
it
could
shine
but
it
is
a
slight
disappointment
the
feel
is
moerate
with
a
light
to
moderate
carbonation
the
slighly
light
carbonation
is
probably
from
my
aggressive
pour
ill
have
to
try
it
in
a
standard
pint
next
time
overall
a
very
solid
brew
im
drinking
it
very
quickly
so
it
cant
be
all
that
bad
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
if
you
like
a
kick
of
hops
very
nice
beer
great
low
price
and
and
an
easy
drinker
definite
session
material
as
with
almost
all
goose
island
beers
drinkability
one
thing
i
look
forward
to
in
an
ipa
is
a
longlasting
finish
usually
very
hopdominant
which
i
didnt
really
get
much
of
from
this
beer
that
was
its
biggest
downfall
otherwise
its
a
fairly
good
beer
drinkability
is
very
good
on
this
always
consistant
ipa
not
overly
bitter
like
some
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
a
fantastic
ipa
copper
in
colour
with
loads
of
leafy
hops
citrus
and
pine
notes
grapefruit
and
white
grape
flavors
abound
a
fair
amount
of
malt
and
bitterness
as
well
i
could
see
some
fans
of
really
bitter
ipas
thinking
this
one
is
a
bit
on
the
tame
side
but
it
strikes
a
nearperfect
balance
for
me
this
is
one
i
really
wish
i
could
get
locally
i
think
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
it
didnt
impress
me
paid
1
00
for
a
bottle
overall
a
decent
ipa
kinda
clashed
in
the
taste
and
i
have
no
idea
what
was
up
with
the
appearance
plenty
of
better
ipas
at
my
beck
and
call
for
me
to
miss
this
one
though
ipas
are
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
this
is
a
beer
i
will
probably
drink
again
overall
an
excellent
ipa
one
of
my
favourites
highly
recommended
a
very
drinkable
ipa
it
would
make
a
fine
session
beer
if
not
the
first
goose
island
beer
i
have
purchased
it
is
the
first
ive
actually
gotten
around
to
drink
so
far
i
am
impressed
drinkability
is
good
just
some
old
fashioned
clean
and
refreshing
stuff
sessionable
for
sure
this
was
brought
back
to
houston
for
me
by
a
friend
that
traveled
to
chicago
on
business
pours
a
nice
copper
colour
with
a
good
frothy
head
that
disappaits
to
a
thin
white
layer
across
the
top
a
nice
hoppy
flavour
and
aroma
with
good
balance
between
hop
and
malt
flavours
bitterness
is
not
as
strong
as
other
ipas
a
medium
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
a
very
decent
and
drinkable
ipa
a
clean
yellow
beer
with
orange
highlights
has
a
big
foamy
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
big
spicey
peppery
hop
boquet
the
flavor
is
mostly
a
tea
like
sweetness
that
blends
out
to
a
dry
hop
finish
the
aroma
got
me
all
pumped
up
the
taste
left
me
dissapointed
this
beer
poured
a
very
nice
orange
amber
color
with
a
fluffycramy
white
head
the
aroma
wasn
not
strong
for
this
what
i
could
smell
was
a
bitey
florallike
citrus
astringency
smell
the
taste
was
full
of
sharp
hops
that
overtook
the
palatte
the
was
very
little
if
any
malt
flavor
the
mouth
feel
was
very
sharp
and
bubble
like
a
macro
brew
large
bitey
feeling
this
would
be
an
ideal
session
beer
light
flavor
light
body
good
flavor
but
not
my
favorite
i
p
a
pours
golden
to
copper
in
color
head
fairly
quickly
dissipates
with
a
thin
film
of
foam
left
on
the
top
aroma
is
definitely
of
grapefruit
first
sip
reveals
a
strong
grapefruit
citrusy
flavor
mouthfeel
is
odd
with
an
almost
oily
feeling
in
the
first
sip
second
sip
gives
more
bitterness
than
grapefruit
not
much
malty
balance
to
this
further
sips
reveal
a
bit
more
watery
mouthfeel
an
acceptable
version
of
the
ipa
not
great
i
think
this
was
the
beer
that
introduced
me
to
ipas
years
back
either
way
whatever
memories
i
have
from
back
then
were
supplanted
this
past
week
orangereddish
pour
light
really
bubbly
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
stuch
around
strong
hops
on
the
nose
biting
pine
perhaps
a
bit
too
strong
but
worked
in
the
hot
weather
about
the
same
on
the
tongue
but
giving
way
to
a
slight
maltiness
toward
the
finish
not
like
the
ipas
i
enjoy
now
but
a
fond
memory
finishes
dry
and
hop
sticky
this
a
full
bodied
medium
and
worth
a
few
for
me
the
return
to
this
ipa
is
like
a
surprise
visit
from
an
old
friend
it
fits
like
a
glove
and
is
as
comfortable
as
a
worn
pair
of
shoes
its
comfort
food
in
a
glass
and
immediately
brightens
any
day
every
sip
takes
me
back
to
my
first
day
of
kindergarten
at
least
beerwise
happy
to
find
this
one
still
available
at
the
blind
tiger
in
nyc
on
tap
poured
a
lightmedium
shade
of
amber
slight
haze
off
white
head
and
nicely
developed
lacing
floral
hoppy
nose
also
plenty
of
piney
hop
goodness
this
is
a
well
hopped
ipa
but
its
not
over
the
top
the
hops
are
punget
and
taste
very
fresh
and
flavorful
but
they
do
not
over
power
this
beer
or
your
taste
buds
well
hopped
yet
still
nicely
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
brew
smooth
soft
mouthfeel
nice
quaffer
seek
out
and
enjoy
this
one
on
tap
nicely
done
example
of
the
style
ill
return
to
when
i
want
a
change
of
pace
from
the
huge
hop
bombs
this
beer
was
medium
bodied
at
best
and
moderately
drinkable
for
an
ipa
it
was
nice
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
well
this
beer
comes
highly
recommended
to
me
the
beer
pours
orangish
amber
in
color
with
ample
light
beige
head
the
aroma
is
a
nice
balance
of
floral
hops
caramel
malt
and
fruity
yeast
the
flavor
is
upfront
bitterness
followed
by
a
solid
caramel
toffee
sweetness
and
a
lingering
hop
finish
this
is
what
an
ipa
should
be
hoppy
and
balanced
and
thusly
very
drinkable
i
know
you
wont
be
too
mad
if
i
spend
this
night
with
my
goose
island
ipa
we
can
share
her
just
dont
steal
her
away
i
cant
afford
to
lose
any
more
beer
lovin
to
you
brilliant
medium
amber
full
white
head
dissipates
somewhat
but
has
nice
lacing
intense
hop
aroma
mainly
citrus
and
pine
light
maltiness
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
strong
bitterness
after
the
first
sip
but
stays
well
balanced
with
citrus
hop
flavour
and
malt
slight
alcohol

very
nice
ipa
thanks
viggo
drinkability
excellent
i
could
drink
and
have
drank
many
of
these
in
an
evening
this
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
it
has
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
with
a
slight
yellow
tint
to
it
it
fades
slowly
leaving
too
few
laces
the
first
scent
i
detect
is
a
piney
floral
one
it
smells
hoppy
it
has
a
citrus
scent
also
i
also
detect
faint
hints
of
lemon
it
tastes
piney
it
has
a
citrus
taste
with
slight
fruit
flavors
making
an
apperance
it
is
not
as
hoppy
as
the
aroma
led
me
to
believe
the
flavor
is
actually
quite
mild
i
think
this
might
be
a
good
beer
for
people
like
myself
who
do
not
usually
drink
hoppy
beers
it
leaves
a
piney
taste
on
the
palate
it
goes
down
smooth
it
is
carbonated
very
well
i
think
this
beer
would
make
a
good
session
beer
because
for
an
ipa
it
is
somewhat
mild
also
it
is
not
high
in
alcohol
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
this
one
give
it
a
shot
you
will
probably
be
glad
you
did
thanks
to
mentor
for
providing
this
beer
i
was
surprised
and
impressed
by
the
delicate
and
soft
nature
of
this
beers
flavor
and
body
not
pungent
or
bitter
at
all
and
only
a
hint
of
dryness
the
malt
is
showcased
well
with
the
hops
still
taking
most
of
the
spotlight
very
balanced
and
is
better
suited
for
the
pale
ale
not
ipa
category
still
a
good
offering
from
goose
nicely
drinkable
beer
best
by
102605
a
tasty
amazingly
refreshing
ipa
well
worth
the
money
also
goes
great
with
spicy
food
cuts
through
the
heat
so
well
you
end
up
getting
cooled
and
refreshed
from
the
heat
and
the
hops
cut
through
enough
that
you
have
a
strong
flavoured
beer
even
paired
with
such
aggressive
food
pours
a
clear
copper
color
a
half
inch
head
holds
on
for
the
entire
ride
this
beer
is
not
overly
aromatic
but
has
a
good
smell
for
me
floral
hops
and
citrus
come
out
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
refreshing
i
can
detect
citrus
along
with
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
it
finishes
well
balanced
the
beer
feels
medium
bodied
as
it
should
but
it
also
seems
to
feel
a
bit
acidic
which
can
take
away
from
the
enjoyment
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
and
all
around
well
crafted
session
beer
i
could
see
getting
this
again
in
the
future
it
is
a
good
brew
to
relax
with
when
you
feel
like
something
simple
yet
tasty
it
also
went
great
with
the
new
york
strip
steak
i
grilled
up
for
dinner
12
oz
bottle
obtained
from
johns

cotton
candy
orange

tangerine
not
grapefruit
sweet
is
quite
below
the
hops
pear
and
apricot
tastes
bitter
hoppy
carried
later
by
a
malt
sweet
then
arises
a
floral
hoppy
from
the
back
and
concludes
withe
a
delightful
toasty
nutty
really
a
nice
progression
no
single
flavor
is
over
the
others
and
the
flavors
overall
are
pleasant
great
as
so
many
ipas
are
in
your
face
hoppy
the
middle
after
the
inital
hops
had
some
pear
and
apricot
not
quite
apricot
more
honeylike
as
if
it
was
apricot
jelly
this
beer
is
tasty
quality
and
highly
quaffable
mdlight
mouthfeel
that
has
a
creamy
quality
about
it
and
is
mildly
carbonated
with
fine
bubbles
forming
on
the
entire
flat
of
the
tongue
and
making
an
acrid
burn
in
the
aftertaste
on
the
sides
of
my
tongue
drinkability
gimmie
lots
id
say
this
is
better
than
the
regular
goose
pale
if
i
could
get
this
rather
than
goose
pale
id
get
this
d
this
is
a
well
built
beer
it
has
good
hops
but
not
huge
hops
and
the
malt
is
caramelized
enough
to
give
it
a
nice
base
very
good
for
a
session
beer
or
a
summer
grilling
brew
goose
island
really
hit
a
strong
beer
with
this
one
it
is
growing
on
me
now
that
half
the
glass
is
gone
it
is
very
drinkable
and
since
it
is
not
real
expensive
it
would
be
a
good
beer
to
stock
up
on
for
the
summer
out
of
the
bottle
and
into
the
glass
head
cascades
to
the
top
and
sits
atop
the
beer
for
most
of
the
ride
and
leaves
some
impressive
lacing
body
is
a
clear
dark
gold
smells
of
floral
mostly
a
floral
aroma
with
citrus
following
behind
and
then
behind
that
too
is
the
malt
that
does
not
want
to
be
pushed
aside
by
the
hops
first
drink
im
surprised
by
how
much
of
the
malt
comes
through
but
lets
the
hops
come
through
too
sweet
malt
over
your
tongue
but
before
you
can
get
sick
of
the
sugars
butter
and
caramels
you
are
greeted
with
the
citrus
deep
bitters
and
earthy
tones
of
the
hops
nothing
too
hopped
too
light
or
too
malty
will
probably
revisit
this
beer
in
the
future
hazy

and
a

not

but
moving

some

some

crisp
a

a

a

a
little
malt
in
the
nose
as
well
ill
have
to
admit
i
was
a
little
let
down
by
the
taste
although
by
no
means
was
it
bad
it
was
simply
a
middle
of
the
road
example
of
an
ipa
the
trademark
hops
were
there
in
the
usual
fashion
as
well
as
a
faint
presence
of
toasted
malt
decent
mouthfeel
easily
quaffed
dry
hoppy
finish
not
a
bad
beer
to
have
at
a
bar
or
sitting
with
friends
but
it
is
nothing
remarkable
bottle
poured
a
medium
lightly
hazed

with
a
fair
tight
cap
soft
carbonation
aroma
of
grapefruit
apricots
and
sweet
malts
viscous
mouth
feel
good
malt
spine
gives
a
sweetish
biscuity
taste
where
mild
hops
and
the
yeasts
add
an
apricot
taste
that
turns
bitter
in
the
finish
very
nice
i
like
this
ipa
wasnt
expecting
this
from
gib
good
medium
mouthfeel
to
this
very
drinkable
brew
a
drinkable
balanced
ipa
that
isnt
over
the
top
and
tuned
to
please
a
hophead
this
is
brewed
closer
to
the
british
version
of
the
ipa
than
the
american
version
very
drinkable
pale
gold
thin
white
head
little
lacing
aroma
is
hoppy
and
floral
a
little
nutty
tastes
pretty
good
but
not
the
hop
bomb
that
i
look
for
in
an
ipa
grapefruit
pine
resins
good
malt
presense
becoming
more
noticeable
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
a
little
oily
as
i
mentioned
this
is
not
a
hop
monster
i
find
it
to
be
a
little
lacking
if
this
is
a
single
but
because
it
is
not
overhopped
it
makes
for
a
pretty
tasty
session
brew
dn
not
bad
not
great
too
fizzy
for
me
to
like
sort
of
a
unibroue
feel
to
it
pours
with
an
off
white
head
over
clear
amber
gold
liquid
rich
super
hopped
nose
with
sweet
background
fresh
floral
hops
wash
over
the
palate
leaving
a
pleasant
bitterness
behind
the
finish
is
long
and
bittersweet
nicely
bitter
without
the
over
the
top
hopping
seen
in
other
ipas
this
is
not
an
ipa
for
strict
hopheads
but
it
is
nice
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
change
the
key
here
is
variety
over
strength
and
this
very
interesting
blend
of
hops
works
great
drinkability
a
good
beer
nonetheless
not
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
i
had
hoped
for
more
hops
yet
felt
if
only
slightly
more
hopped
than
the
honkers
will
i
purchase
this
one
seperate
only
on
sale
and
if
the
honkers
is
out
of
stock
this
was
quite
a
pleasant
surprise
this
ipa
was
probably
the
least
hoppy
ive
tasted
but
nonetheless
it
was
still
wonderful
the
beer
pours
to
a
dark
golden
color
resembling
more
of
a
pale
ale
than
an
ipa
the
head
is
moderate
and
doesnt
last
long
but
neither
will
the
liquid
if
your
experience
is
like
mine
the
taste
is
of
hops
but
not
overly
hoppy
as
some
ipas
tend
to
be
the
pale
ale
taste
still
shows
through
in
the
aftertaste
i
will
definately
drink
more
of
this
particularly
during
the
change
from
winter
to
summer
when
i
will
still
be
craving
hops
but
wont
quite
want
such
a
heavy
brew
picked
up
a
goose
island
pub
pack
always
had
pretty
good
brews
for
the
price
their
ipa
pours
a
light
amber
colour
with
some
haze
and
residue
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
i
think
probably
from
dryhopping
lots
of
white
head
and
lots
of
lacing
smells
very
hoppy
kind
of
like
cascades
with
a
little
bit
of
maltiness
but
majority
is
hops
tastes
hoppy
as
well
with
a
very
pleasant
bitterness
a
bit
of
a
toffee
smoothness
to
it
as
well
very
good
taste
and
quite
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
with
plenty
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
high
good
for
any
time
of
the
year
i
recommend
it
wholeheartedly
its
a
nice
enough
beer
and
drinkable
but
not
very
exciting
goose
island
india
pale
ale
is
a
rock
solid
ipa
if
this
is
your
fair
you
will
be
right
at
home
pours
a
clear
golden
pils
color
with
some
orangy
tinges
to
it
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
subtle
sprucy
hops
and
a
honeyed
malt
profile
with
some
underlying
fruitiness
rather
balanced
and
soft
easily
drinkable
and
not
very
aggressive
compared
to
some
other
monsterofanipas
that
are
out
there
this
is
my
first
goose
island
beer
ive
tried
and
its
pretty
good
ipa
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
beers
in
the
future
just
a
really
really
good
standard
ipa
proving
again
that
a
beer
doesnt
have
to
be
15
alcohol
to
be
good
and
also
proving
that
the
folks
as
goose
island
know
what
theyre
doing
id
heartily
recommend
this
one
drinkability
a
highly
drinkable
ipa
very
good
enough
to
keep
the
palate
interested
and
aroused
but
not
so
much
that
it
blasts
your
tongue
into
oblivion
for
the
evening
if
someone
is
looking
for
a
nice
hoppy
crossover
i
would
definitely
steer
them
in
this
direction
good
stuff
very
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
can
be
paired
with
any
food
at
any
occasion
can
be
found
anywhere
in
chicagoland
at
very
cheap
prices
abv
isnt
too
high
so
you
can
pack
these
puppies
away
and
not
worry
during
drinking
in
the
middle
you
will
taste
the
malt
usage
in
brewing
the
aftertaste
is
quite
better
again
the
hop
lovers
dream
i
would
recommend
it
although
its
a
beer
that
i
do
like
having
one
or
two
a
day
but
not
something
i
can
consistantly
drink
on
an
all
night
basis
much
better
on
draft
than
in
the
bottle
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
hoppy
with
some
slight
fruits
and
a
bit
of
malt
the
flavor
has
a
caramel
malt
backing
with
a
strong
hop
presence
well
balanced
this
was
a
pretty
good
ipa
and
easy
to
drink
drinkability
at
5
99
a
sixer
at
certain
locales
this
may
be
the
best
ipa
on
the
market
around
chicago
where
i
live
this
stuff
is
simply
divinelyinspired
kudos
to
the
folks
whove
made
real
beer
a
way
of
life
for
the
past
16
years
12

a
well
made
ipa
the
goose

pale

pours
out
a
goodlooking
amber
with
a
smallish
offwhite

the
aroma
is
of
citrus
hops
and
a
good
malt
backbone
nice
lacing
down
the

and
an
unstoppable
citrus
flavor
nicely
bitter
with
a
bitter

good

and
a
solid
mouthfeel
from
the
ample
carbonation
final
thought
this
and
magic
hat
hi
p
a
are
in
their
own
league
when
it
comes
to
ipas
outstanding
beer
and
goose
is
now
4
for
4
drinkability
this
is
one
of
my
old
standbys
a
very
solid
ipa
and
bitter
enough
to
impress
any
hophead
at
5
9
its
got
a
mild
alcoholic
bite
to
it
and
still
is
highly
quaffable
you
can
tell
goose
island
puts
a
lot
of
work
into
their
brews
this
is
one
ipa
i
recommend
anyone
to
try
this
is
about
as
averagely
hoppy
as
the
golden
summer
ales
that
british
brewers
are
currently
making
as
fast
as
the
british
can
consume
them
this
does
however
have
a
very
fruity
malt
base
which
the
golden
summer
ales
do
not
have
the
fruity
malt
is
a
beautiful
counterpoint
to
the
citric
hops
and
tastes
very
english
if
just
a
little
syrupy
the
hops
seem
to
be
the
main
thing
here
and
they
are
very
tasty
i
assume
the
hops
are
american
because
we
have
no
hops
this
sharp
in
britain
very
enjoyable
man
i
wish
i
had
a
sixer
of
this
as
opposed
to
only
one
more
bottle
darn
good
ipa
here
very
flavorful
but
not
so
overwhelming
that
it
couldnt
be
a
good
session
brew
pours
an
attractive
hazy
copper
hue
under
a
one
finger
white
head
that
fades
very
slowly
and
leaves
some
good
looking
lace
the
nose
is
almost
caramel
sweet
to
go
with
some
nice
flowery
hops
the
mouth
is
mildly
carbonated
and
fairly
heavy
although
not
sticky
theres
some
nice
smooth
malt
to
open
followed
by
a
mild
but
insistent
hoppy
bite
citrus
and
flower
blend
together
well
to
give
a
smooth
as
silk
impression
to
the
hops
without
a
lot
of
bitterness
and
nothing
overwhelming
a
good
middleoftheroad
ipa
sure
ill
have
another
pours
out
a
nice
clear
golden
orange
with
a
small
head
that
lingers
only
for
a
few
minutes
has
a
piney
hop
aroma
to
it
along
with
some
maltiness
upon
first
sip
there
is
a
enjoyable
hop
flavor
that
tastes
a
bit
piney
as
well
pleasently
bitter
with
warm
malt
undertones
seems
to
be
a
bit
lacking
in
body
but
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
allows
for
easy
drinking
after
a
few
sips
the
bitterness
comes
through
on
the
back
of
the
palate
a
bit
stronger
but
not
overwhelming
ipa
is
one
of
my
fave
styles
and
drinkability
is
high
on
this
one
it
has
a
solid
flavor
and
a
sixer
is
not
too
expensive
making
it
a
good
session
brew
delicious
ipa
very
straightforward
and
while
not
especially
comples
exactly
what
i
expect
when
i
think
ipa
a
hazy
apricot
tone
on
the
pour
not
much
of
a
head
but
it
forms
a
frothy
ring
and
leaves
some
lacing
all
hops
on
the
nose
orangelemongrapefruit
zest
the
hops
dont
leave
any
room
for
malt
in
the
flavour
as
well
this
is
a
very
citric
ipa
starting
with
notes
of
orange
and
tangerine
and
finishing
more
with
grapefruit
rind
with
a
sticky
pine
aftertaste
still
enjoyable
for
the
hops
alone
though
if
youre
into
that
they
are
not
overwhelmingly
bitter
but
predominate
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
watery
but
this
is
an
easy
drinker
i
feel
satisfied
a
bit
onedimensional
over
all
or
very
lopsided
yet
i
keep
going
back
for
more
until
the
glass
is
empty
as
it
warms
up
some
malt
finally
manages
to
break
through
the
brick
wall
of
hops
adding
a
little
more
character
thanks
to
northyorksammy
for
holding
on
to
this
for
me
for
so
long
this
ale
pours
a
hazy
golden
brown
with
a
thin
head
the
smell
is
divine
very
sweet
and
hoppy
with
almost
a
bananalike
quality
to
it
the
taste
is
refreshingly
tart
while
not
my
favorite
ipa
bells
twohearted
ale
probably
takes
that
prize
it
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
with
some
orange
hues
present
a
billowing
white
head
appears
and
laces
the
glass
thickly
aromas
are
very
hoppy
and
citrusy
but
thats
all
i
can
sense
in
this
one
for
taste
this
beer
hits
initially
citrusy
and
tangy
with
the
hops
dominating
following
there
is
a
little
bready
malt
followed
by
some
caramel
and
a
nice
sweet
taste
finally
this
brew
finishes
resiny
and
piney
with
the
hops
leaving
it
a
nice
ipa
this
beer
is
fairly
light
bodied
and
smooth
with
does
make
it
quite
drinkable
but
unfortunately
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
up
front
raw
hops
a
nice
session
beer
though
drinkabilty
a
great
ipa
id
take
this
any
day
poured
a
bright
orangeishgold
color
with
a
bit
of
haze
and
a
goodsized
foamy
white
head
the
head
soon
fell
back
to
a
thin
foam
cover
on
the
surface
that
left
a
little
lace
on
the
glass
hops
definitely
dominate
the
aroma
fresh
piney
citrusy
hops
in
abundance
the
taste
as
well
is
predominantly
hops
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
does
peek
through
but
the
main
flavor
is
pine
orangegrapefruit
and
spice
notes
provided
by
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
fullbodied
and
satisfying
a
pleasant
lingering
bitterness
with
echoes
of
the
hop
flavors
are
found
in
the
aftertaste
i
havent
tried
a
lot
of
ipas
yet
but
i
like
this
one
pretty
well

i

quite

the

medicinal
and
wormwoodlike
bitterness
that
remains
in
the
aftertaste
is
not
to
my
liking
this
is
a
decently
drinkable
ipa
i
cant
decide
if
the
flavor
is
nicely
strong
or
overpowering

it
definately
tastes

just
the

of

reminds

overbearing
taste
is
very
clean
and
refreshing
the
hops
dont
dominate
this
brew
but
their
presence
is
felt
it
finishes
with
just
a
hint
of
citrus
and
malt
i
should
also
note
that
this
beer
is
extremely
consistent
and
there
was
a
little
bit
of
lacing
on

with

a

easy

e
ipa
not
overly

very
good
just
an
outstanding
take
on
the
english
ipa
underrated
imo
due
to
the
expectations
many
have
for
an
american
ipa
subtle
o
a
good
ipa
i
prefer
the
american
style
better
though
easy
drinking
ipa
hoppy
overall
this
is
a
good
albeit
fairly
run
of
the
mill
english
ipa
nice
earthiness
from
the
hops
but
lacks
a
bit
of
the
maltiness
complexity
found
in
other
examples
all
in
all
a
good
beer
o
this
is
a
bland
non
descript
ale
with
no
complexity
after
a
couple
of
attempts
at
this
one
i
finally
decided
to
pour
this
down
the
drain
while
remembering
i
had
a
lagunitas
on
hand
o
well
done
version
of
a
traditional
english
ipa
been
a
while
since
ive
had
this
style
so
its
fun
to
recalibrate
from
the
american
spins
on
this
classic
well
done
not
a
bad
ipa
for
a
local
beer
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
englishstyle
ipa
but
this
one
is
pretty
tasty
id
have
another
o
a
very
solid
sessionable
ipa
from
one
of
ashevilles
mainstay
breweries
i
like
that
they
go
the
english
route
while
a
lot
of
other
asheville
breweries
do
a
decent
american
style
ipa
but
they
all
end
up
tasting
the
same
for
whatever
reason
this
one
sticks
out
o
nice
offering
if
not
world
changing
came
out
a
murky
dark
amber
with
a
slight
reddish
hue
on
the
edges
a
large
creamy
beige
head
rested
on
top
pretty
lace
sticks
around
the
nose
pretty
basic
for
the
style
some
minor
floral
tones
mild
citrus
and
a
sweet
balanced
finish
the
body
had
moderate
depth
decent
carbonation
easy
drinker
not
too
filling
not
a
sharp
ipa
by
any
means
the
hops
are
tamed
down
a
bit
wellbalanced
with
toffee
sweetness
and
mild
citrus
flavors
overall
a
beer
that
would
do
well
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
herbal
crystal
taste
but
needs
more
distinction
in
its
malt
to
hop
profiles
floral
hoppyness
copper
amber
color
light
head
that
lingered
on
the
edge
more
than
34
of

i
will
be
seeking
the
beer
out
again
i
am
in
asheville
nc
for
a
conference
you
can
bet
i
will
be
doing
all
i
can
to
find
this
beer
in
san
diego
ca
when
i
return
home
o
good
representation
of
this
style
for
sure
well
balanced
o
overall
a
very
good
englishstyle
ipa
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
ipa
that
is
for
the
most
part
middle
of
the
road
but
without
fault
as
well
nothing
special
here
but
a
decent
choice
if
youre
a
hophead
a
nicely
done
well
balance
ipa
it
isnt
a
standout
knock
em
out
of
the
park
brew
but
for
sitting
around
shooting
the
breeze
and
craving
some
hops
it
gets
the
job
done
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
on
tap
somewhere
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
im
pretty
sure
it
was
my
first
english
ipa
if
blindfolded
i
wouldve
been
convinced
it
was
an
english
pale
ale
by
smell
and
just
as
equally
convinced
it
was
a
piney
american
ipa
by
taste
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
body
and
small
bubble
carbonation
give
this
a
medium
feel
lots
of
hoppy
resin
and
oil
leave
this
slightly
sticky
overall
not
a
bad
try
on
the
style
not
big
fan
of
the
english
ipas
but
this
one
is
pretty
well
done
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
slightly
hazed
auburncopper
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
bright
white
head
that
starts
around
a
half
an
inch
and
settles
quickly
into
a
surface
coat
nose
of
biscuit
and
toffee
in
the
backbone
with
a
sharp
tart
grapefruit
character
and
some
floral
highlights
smells
bright
and
light
flavors
are
bitter
and
tart
forward
with
grapefruit
notes
abound
solid
roasted
toffee
backbone
with
a
rich
sweetness
very
well
balanced
and
some
peppery
notes
at
the
end
of
the
palate
spiced
and
resiny
bitter
aftertaste
on
a
light
smooth
body
the
beer
has
a
crisp
drying
finish
very
balanced
and
very
solid
good
beer
flavor
is
great
and
i
keep
coming
back
to
it
give
it
a
try
with
the
green
at
tupelo
honey
id
put
this
in
my
fridge
definitely
an
english
ipa
pours
a
copper
color
with
minimal
head
smell
is
earthy
grassy
slightly
sweet
taste
is
also
earthy
clay
mixed
with
a
bit
of
swamp
water
nice
mouthfeel
overall
this
beer
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
and
this
reviewer
feels
its
average
at
best
try
something
else
its
a
solid
english
ipa
but
the
hop
profile
seems
a
bit
off
herbal
and
earthy
without
enough
malt
balance
to
keep
it
in
check
www
brewreport
blogspot
com
o
the
herbal
and
grassy
flavors
of
this
ipa
make
it
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
compared
to
the
other
traditional
hops
used
in
other
beers
in
the
style
o
a
pretty
standard
english
ipa
o
very
well
balanced
smooth
fantastically
drinkable
nothing
to
crazy
but
just
extremely
well
balanced
in
every
way
great
beer
o
very
nice
combination
of
the
hop
flavor
of
an
ipa
while
also
being
a
medium
body
beer
it
makes
for
a
good
combo
unlike
some
other
local
ipas
where
i
feel
the
hops
are
designed
for
sensory
overload
and
cause
me
to
have
a
lingering
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
adequate
carbonation
solid
a
very
good
ipa
which
i
highly
recommend
o
really
nice
ipa
to
pass
the
time
with
while
i
waited
for
my
bbq
reviewed
from
notes
taken
from
serving
at
the
asheville
airport
served
way
to
cold
but
as
it
warmed
up
it
showed
its
stuff
beautifully
just
spent
some
time
in
chicago
drinking
tons
of
3
floyds
alpha
king
and
this
beer
compares
remarkably
well
impressive
surprised
and
impressed
with
this
one
triangle
beer
drinkers
seek
this
one
out
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
like
the
style
i
enjoyed
this
ipa
and
am
looking
forward
to
more
growlers
from
these
brewers
not
an
awful
beer
definitely
not
what
i
was
expecting
malt
character
caught
me
off
guard
and
the
hop
character
was
a
little
mild
for
my
preference
poured
into
a
12
oz
pilsnerlike
glass
at
vbgb
in
charlotte
amber
in
color
medium
head
and
retention
aroma
is
mild
grass
and
mild
caramel
malt
listed
as
an
english
ipa
and
its
obvious
there
isnt
anything
american
in
style
about
it
taste
is
mild
bitterness
touch
of
malt
sweetness
nothing
over
the
top
but
quite
drinkable
i
would
think
this
is
a
good
gateway
ipa
o
an
ok
ipa
go
for
their
esb
not
this
had
while
sitting
at
the
brewery
on
a
recent
trip
to
asheville
served
from
cask
into
a

shaker
poured
a
slightly
hazy

with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
bone
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
one
finger
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
bitter
hop
citrus
hop
and
citrus
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
bitter
hop
and
slight
citrus
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
ipa
definitely
had
a
pretty
nice
citrus
aspect
going
on
in
this
one
i
just
wish
the
flavor
would
have
been
a
little
more
robust
in
the
citrus
aspect
this
one
is
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
are
in
the
area
ontap
at
jack
of
the

nope
not
like
this
at
all
beer
is
thin
and
has
nearly
no
hop
flavor
some
malt
on
the
lead
off
but
overall
the
beer
is
just
a
gross
mess
of
off
flavors
why
am
i
drinking
this
well
im
not
anymore
the
beer
appears
clear
and
orange
in
color
with
a
half
inch
of
head
that
leaves
some
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
odd
with
scents
of
hops
and
weird
herbal
notes
the
flavor
brings
more
of
the
same
with
a
prominent
taste
of
overly
cooked
vegetables
the
beer
is
out
of
balance
and
off
putting
an
astringent
bitter
taste
lingers
on
the
tongue
not
recommended
d
not
a
very
good
ipa
smell
and
taste
seemed
to
have
a
lot
of
grainbready
malts
to
it
as
well
as
a
small
amount
of
vegetables
which
i
did
not
enjoy
wouldnt
seek
out
again
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
singlefinger
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
slowly
falls
down
my
glass
the
nose
brings
forward
some
light
malt
and
english
hopsmaybe
grassy
and
herbalbut
along
with
that
comes
a
bit
of
an
off
care
and
slight
vegetal
notes
the
taste
is
similarly
lacking
in
any
hop
component
and
simply
has
a
mild
graininess
with
a
bit
of
vegetable
skin
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
average
carbonation
for
the
serving
type
drinkability
is
not
particularly
good
i
would
not
say
that
there
were
any
straightout
flaws
or
offflavors
with
this
beer
just
that
there
was
nearly
nothing
in
the
way
of
hop
or
malt
character
to
really
hide
any
flaws
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
if
i
wasnt
planning
on
driving
home
i
would
have
drank
a
couple
more
of
these
i
loved
it
i
cant
wait
to
drink
more
of
this
beer
and
more
from
green
man
ales
and
brewery
green
man
ipa
pours
amber
and
very
clear
not
a
whole
lot
of
head
but
i
had
it
on
draught
and
the
bar
tender
wasnt
trying
to
create
any
head
i
couldnt
smell
a
whole
lot
but
the
taste
was
huge
and
delicious
it
almost
had
a
dirty
rawness
similar
to
the
green
man
esb
there
was
so
much
flavor
and
it
was
surprisingly
well
rounded
for
a
local
place
this
was
the
second
sampling
that
ive
tried
from
this
brewery
and
i
have
really
enjoyed
it
both
times
there
is
a
nice
bite
with
a
pleasant
sweetnessbitterness
combo
there
was
so
much
flavor
in
this
beer
that
i
wouldnt
call
it
easy
drinking
but
i
want
to
want
more
of
it
the
body
had
moderate
depth
decent
carbonation
easy
drinker
not
too

not
a
sharp
ipa
by
any
means
the
hops
are
tamed
down
a
bit
wellbalanced
with
toffee
sweetness
and
mild
citrus
flavors
this
is
not
a
hopheads
ipa
but
it
is
easily
accessible
and
good
i
liked
it
overall
a
really
solid
ipa
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
nothing
special
here
but
it
was
a
nice
enough
beer
to
have
with
some
good
pizza
pint
at
the
brewery
tasting
room
overall
impression
maybe
ill
give
this
one
another
try
because
its
hard
to
believe
it
would
sell
tasting
like
this
all
the
time
drinkability
highly
drinkable
and
smooth
quite

as

with

dryness
and
decent
carbonation
this
one
is
somewhat
enjoyable
but
i
must
say
its
the
weakest
asheville
ipa
ive
had
yet
and
ive
now
had
them
all
at
least
until
the
next
one
comes
around
overall
this
is
a
solid
english
ipa
though
its
nothing
special
very
drinkable
and
worth
a
shot
if
youre
in
the
area
drinkability
a
pleasant
surprise
it
was
the
end
of
the
evening
we
were
wandering
not
expecting
to
find
anything
and
i
came
across
this
its
not
the
worlds
best
ipa
but
its
a
low
abv
tasty
sessionable
brew
interesting
and
local
and
im
very
glad
to
have
tried
it
a
friend
picked
up
a
growler
while
over
in
aville
and
shared
with
me
yesterday
poured
into
a
standard

glass

character
on
the
palate
as
well
a
hefty
lightly
sweet
biscuit

flavor
dominates
up

than
it
melds
into
a
leafy
somewhat
herbalminty
hop
finish
if
your
a
big
fan
of
the
more
subtle
english
variety
ipa
youll
like
this
alotfor
me
it
was
ok
this
one
pours
a
nice
amber
in
color
with
good
carbonation
and
excellent
lacing
down
the
glass
smell
is
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malt
somewhat
piney
and
earthy
with
hints
of
citrus
in
there
as
well
but
malts
are
about
as
pronounced
caramel
malts
and
i
notice
the
honey
sweetness
as
the
beer
is
described
to
have
mouthfeel
isnt
overly
bitter
and
pretty
light
not
too
drying
and
not
the
same
feeling
as
an
english
or
american
ipa
good
drinkability
but
it
gets
you
easier
than
the
porter
will
a
nice
take
on
the
english
version
of
the
ipa
i
enjoyed
it
i
love
ipas
but
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
one
it
started
well
enough
with
a
nice
pour
amber
with
a
very
good
head
some
nice
retention
and
a
bit
of
lacing
the
aromas
were
thin
and
grainy
with
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
a
bit
of
sweetness
as
well
but
not
really
integrated
taste
was
similar
a
thinly
carbonated
hop
tea
with
no
real
malt
nalance
thin
and
watery
with
one
note
spicy
bitter
hops
and
just
a
residual
sweetness
out
of
whack
and
quickly
tiresome
to
the
palate
needs
more
carbonation
structure
and
malt
drinkability
cask
and
you
shall
receive
even
though
the
ale
tries
to
balance
with
robust
amber
ale
attributes
the
hops
stand
proud
and
keep
the
focus
on
those
classic
american
taste
its
a
renegade
ipa
that
gives
no
cares
to
the
style
police
but
achieves
a
perfect
balance
and
set
of
complexities
that
are
unique
onto
its

this
very
unfiltered
beer
ends
up
quite
hazy
in
the
glass
with
a
dull
copper
color
and
an
off
white
head
that
laces
nicely
the
smell
is
dominated
by
light
floral
and
grassy
hop
notes
with
a
base
of
crystal
and
biscuit
malt
while
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
caramels
and
biscuity
malt
shine
through
but
are
quickly
replaced
by
a
strong
bitter
character
that
doesnt
come
with
much
in
the
way
of
hop
flavor
other
than
perhaps
some
floral
spice
at
the
finish
this
is
quite
puckeringly
bitter
which
lingers
nicely
inviting
the
next
sip
moderate
to
high
carbonation
and
the
lack
of
an
overly
sweet
malt
character
make
this
lively
in
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
english
ipa
quite
different
from
the
more
common
american
style
that
weve
all
grown
so
accustomed
to
it
is
nice
to
get
a
taste
of
something
a
little
different
like
this
every
once
in
a
while
to
remind
you
how
ipas
started
out
different
label
than
shown
fine
organic
ales
now
on
the
label
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
really
enjoyed
the
flavor
and
smell
too
smooth
for
the
contemporary
ipa
scene
traditional
and
very
good
but
without
the
cheerful
finish
that
i
like
in
any
ipa
this
recipe
has
changed
and
this
beer
is
a
lot
better
than
it
used
to
be
it
now
uses
magnum
fuggles
and
centenial
hops
with
a
lighter
malt
character
try
it
again
o
not
a
lot
of
complexity
but
enjoyable
o
this
is
a
great
east
coast
style
ipa
i
would
put
the
abv
estimate
at
6
2
or
lower
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
presense
but
nothing
distracting
the
sweetness
balanced
with
the
mild
bitter
is
really
nice
the
body
is
fantastic
along
with
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
ipa
i
would
definitely
drink
more
or
share
them
this
is
a
beer
that
an
early
ipa
padawan
might
like
as
they
develope
their
palate
it
is
a
good
intro
to
the
style
without
being
a
hop
bomb
dont
hate
on
it
because
you
can
find
it
in
supermarkets
and
its
not
named
heady
topper
very
clean
tasting
bitter
ipa
good
amt
of
caramel
malt
shining
through
the
hops
but
still
hoppy
as
hell
and
balanced
clean
tasting
and
a
dark
orangeamber
red
color
pretty
foggy
and
unfiltered
looking
just
a
nice
one
slightly
above
average
but
not
a
mind
blower
a
good
english
ipa
and
a
great
session
ipa
a
perfect
beer
to
spend
a
night
with
and
not
regret
it
in
the
morning
definitely
a
repeat
buy
id
revisit
wolavers
ipa
on
a
hot
summer
day
with
female
friends
but
wouldnt
select
as
a
yearround
goto
if
you
prefer
a
smooth
ipa
without
much
bite
then
give
it
a
try
overall
a
good
solid
ipa
organic
not
as
refreshing
as
i
prefer
my
ipas
but
solid
nonetheless
o
good
beer
with
the
right
hops
and
bitterness
for
the
style
drinkable
at
6
5
abv
overall
a
well
balanced
organic
offering
from
a
solid
but
not
overly
remarkable
brewery
definitely
enjoyed
and
recommend
for
fans
of
a
smoother
ipa
overall
pretty
nice
beer
for
an
eipa
not
familiar
with
the
style
but
this
is
a
good
way
to
start
off
the
english
ipa
has
not
been
a
go
to
style
for
me
and
they
have
been
increasingly
popular
in
the
northeast
it
seems
this
one
though
is
a
winner
a
version
far
superior
to
its
peers
it
pours
a
hazed
orange
to
brass
color
with
a
lasting
inch
of
khaki
fizz
the
nose
is
nicely
hopped
more
bitter
than
anything
else
in
terms
of
aromatics
with
a
sturdy
but
clean
rather
than
filling
english
malt
vibe
less
caramel
in
the
malt
flavor
more
fresh
bread
a
nice
combination
with
the
lightly
citric
hopping
i
get
just
a
touch
of
grapefruit
in
the
finish
there
is
a
ton
of
body
here
a
few
of
these
is
ample
nice
carbonation
and
clean
finish
give
it
some
drinkability
though
ive
learned
that
even
well
made
versions
of
english
ipas
are
not
my
favorite
this
is
one
of
the
few
times
ill
ever
be
patriotic
but
the
american
ipa
style
to
me
is
a
much
more
enjoyable
brew
than
even
the
best
of
the
english
persuasion
this
would
be
a
textbook
example
of
the
style
though
and
is
worthy
of
higher
praise
poured
into
becker
pint
glass
dark
orange
slightly
cloudy
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
nice
lacing
smell
is
wellbalanced
lots
of
malt
with
some
crackery
notes
and
some
attenuated
floral
hop
scents
taste
is
spot
on
the
nose
crackery
slightly
sweet
malts
and
floral
juicy
hops
on
the
back
end
with
a
full
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
wet
crisp
finish
certainly
nowhere
near
as
hoppy
as
its
americanstyle
counterparts
but
a
fine
beer
overall
not
one
for
the
ages
but
it
might
get
you
through
in
a
pinch
in
the
end
there
just
isnt
much
to
write
home
about
in
this
beer
very
average
overall
very
original
refreshing
made
in
vermont
ipa
subtle
and
good
starter
ipa
personally
i
like
the
piney
crisp
complexities
of
dales
pale
ale
stone
troegs
this
one
less
citrus
and
more
earthy
it
is
a
nice
break
from
the
more
traditional
every
hop
head
must
try
it
organic
made
in
vermont
not
a
bad
ipa
at
all
just
a
bit
boring
and
bland
o
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
very
malty
ipa
i
was
hoping
for
more
hops
fruity
malts
throughout
and
some
light
citrus
hops
easy
to
drink
and
again
not
a
bad
beer
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
hoppy
ipa
this
isnt
the
one
for
you
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
meh
its
okay
but
this
wolavers
line
is
not
really
impressing
me
so
far
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
with
a
decent
flavor
its
not
very
forward
but
its
enjoyable
i
could
slug
a
few
of
these
with
ease
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
hazy
bright
peachcopper
coloring
with
a
fluffy
white
frothy
head
that
clings
all
over
the
glass
aromas
of
subtle
sweet
caramel
resiny
fresh
hops
and
a
light
citrus
highlight
smells
very
well
balanced
and
very
palatable
flavors
are
light
with
a
resiny
and
peppery
hop
forward
presence
that
is
quickly
followed
by
a
light
sweet
malt
backbone
much
lighter
flavors
than
the
aromas
lead
you
to
believe
very
smooth
and
balanced
and
very
drinkable
citrus
highlights
join
the
party
at
the
end
of
the
palate
and
the
blend
goes
right
into
the
aftertaste
with
the
citrus
and
spicy
hops
holding
most
of
the
flavor
profile
at
that
point
very
tasty
and
well
blended
light
bodied
throughout
but
still
manages
to
support
the
flavors
resiny
slightly
bitter
finish
that
dries
the
mouth
very
tasty
ipa
overall
definitely
a
surprisingly
tasty
beer
for
its
organic
status
and
i
would
recommend
to
an
ipa
connoisseur
looking
to
expand
their
palate
overall
it
is
actually
quite
different
then
the
more
standard
67
abv
ipa
not
nearly
as
citrus
and
much
more
earthy
it
is
a
nice
break
from
the
more
traditional
and
is
well
worth
a
try
o
a
pretty
decent
ipa
with
a
nice
hops
flavor
that
unfortunately
isnt
to
lively
im
hoping
this
is
a
result
of
not
being
all
that
fresh
because
if
the
flavors
poped
it
would
be
an
outstanding
beer
there
is
a
bit
of
astringency
while
not
that
bad
that
could
be
reduced
by
using
a
high
alpha
acid
hop
variety
taste
goes
from
malt
to
a
grassy
bitter
lemon
rind
not
really
that
appealing
this
one
for
me
is
a
thumbs
down
will
not
try
this
again
really
nice
brew
here
i
really
like
this
one
case
worthy
sessionable
stuff
here
very
good
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
stamped
32960151712
sampled
on
june
9
2012
the
pour
is
a
slightly
cloudy
medium
to
dark
amber
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
lingers
the
aroma
is
rather
hopfree
but
i
get
a
nice
sweet
malt
note
along
with
a
clean
crisp
feel
overall
mellow
on
the
nose
the
body
is
light
to
medium
but
leaning
more
to
medium
ok
the
hops
announce
themselves
with
much
vigor
as
early
as
the
first
sip
it
is
moderately
bitter
toward
the
end
this
is
a
decent
enough
ipa
o
this
was
a
decent
brew
im
pretty
sure
i
would
have
this
again
an
ok
but
lesser
ipa
grab
yourself
some
broken
halo
instead
moderate
carbonation
and
body
smooth
mouthfeel
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
very
good
beer
perhaps
i
have
palate
fatigue
from
all
of
the
heavily
hopped
west
coast
and
piney
ipas
that
this
one
was
a
welcomed
changed
very
well
balanced
easily
drinkable
not
too
english
suits
me
well
at
the
moment
o
good
but
not
great
certainly
different
from
the
litany
of
west
coast
ipas
out
there
12oz
bottle
purchased
at
market
basket
in
somersworth
murky
yellowamber
body
with
a
half
inch
of
offwhite
head
grass
grapefruit
and
lemon
waft
from
the
aroma
lemon
pine
and
grass
with
slight
grapefruit
notes
comprise
the
flavor
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
not
bad
o
this
ipa
let
a
lot
to
be
desired
i
really
wanted
more
hop
aroma
and
flavor
the
malts
got
the
best
of
this
one
overall
damn
2
for
2
but
i
like
this
even
more
than
the
southampton
version
since
it
has
a
deeper
level
of
sweet
malts
next
to
bittering
hops
six
pack
would
be
easy
to
drink
o
this
definitely
wasnt
the
most
hoppy
ipa
that
ive
had
but
it
was
definitely
easily
drinkable
very
well
balanced
between
the
malty
sweetness
and
the
hops
definitely
an
ipa
that
i
would
try
again
but
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
refreshing
organic
easy
drinking
perfect
use
of
some
vermont
water
good
brew
below
avg
ipa
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
about
a
centimeter
of
head
that
quickly
dissipates
did
not
get
a
strong
aroma
of
anything
but
a
slight
hint
of
hops
right
away
you
taste
the
hops
but
it
is
not
overpowering
also
a
slight
citrus
taste
which
adds
to
the
overall
taste
nicely
carbonation
is
right
and
it
goes
down
smooth
with
not
much
aftertaste
definitely
one
that
you
could
drink
all
night
a
nice
ipa
and
organic
to
boot
however
it
is
like
many
out
there
this
is
a
very
glowing
orange
with
a
nice
translucent
body
and
the
smell
of
orange
rind
the
taste
is
almost
overpoweringly
bitter
orangenot
orange
rind
but
orange
pipearthyherbal
hops
and
some
malt
sweetness
light
body
that
could
use
better
carbonation
finishes
quite
dry
its
pretty
much
a
middleoftheroad
ipa
for
me
overall
meh
very
little
on
the
hop
profile
more
bitterness
nose
is
practically
nonexistant
and
sticky
sweet
d
weakish
nose
simple
malt
profile
but
flavorful
and
dynamic
hops
nicely
straight
forward
interpretation
of
an
american
ipa
o
overall
this
beer
was
a
big
disappointment
was
looking
forward
to
having
this
beer
but
regretted
getting
it
this
is
a
sessionable
ipa
i
really
hope
i
dont
finish
the
six
pack
all
in
one
shot
but
i
might
have
to
tasty
nice
looking
pleasant
smell
and
easy
drinking
make
this
a
ipa
to
try
if
you
see
it
around
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
copper
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
hops
taste
is
very
hop
heavy
considerably
bitter
really
not
much
else
going
on
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
this
is
simply
a
good
ipa
o
very
good
ipa
not
overly
hopped
easy
drinker
good
for
a
few
anytime
this
is
a
pretty
decent
albeit
average
ipa
its
fairly
bitter
with
the
onenote
hoppiness
overshadowing
the
malt
as
expected
not
a
lot
of
detail
in
terms
of
flavor
moderately
carbonated
and
crisp
pretty
refreshing
overall
this
one
really
doesnt
stand
out
amongst
a
crowded
field
although
i
guess
if
youre
looking
for
an
organic
beer
than
this
might
be
your
choice
not
super
impressed
with
wolavers
offerings
to
this
point
unfortuneately
i
have
been
a
patron
and
visitor
to
otter
creek
for
a
long
time
this
is
a
nice
bitter
but
drinkable
ipa
not
over
the
top
on
aroma
and
hop
flavor
but
certainly
scratches
your
hop
itch
if
you
want
a
certified
organic
ipa
i
guess
this
is
the
one
though
it
is
decidedly
average
and
surounded
by
stellar
though
not
organic
competition
on
the
shelf
o
not
a
standout
ipa
but
a
pleasant
balanced
one
nonetheless
poured
from
bottle
with
minimal
head
and
good
amount
of
lacing
smell
is
minimal
floral
hops
some
hay
hoppy
with
good
malt
compliment
slightly
dirty
hop
malt
profile
good
balance
palate
is
good
nice
bitter
dry
finish
good
for
an
organic
ipa
not
in
my
top
ten
ipas
maybe
but
a
good
choice
if
youre
into
organic
products
oglad
to
find
an
ipa
thats
a
little
lighter
on
the
hops
although
some
people
may
discredit
this
beer
for
not
being
as
hoppy
as
a
traditional
ipa
i
like
it
o
a
nice
ipa
not
too
ridiculous
on
the
hops
but
a
notice
dose
of
them
id
definitely
have
another
this
is
an
allaround
good
ipa
its
not
too
crazy
and
its
not
boring
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
it
im
confused
by
the
14
85
pdev
maybe
this
beer
is
inconsistent
ive
had
this
a
few
times
and
its
always
been
allaround
good
o
ok
ive
had
better
thats
for
sure
cheers
my
first
organic
beer
and
i
have
to
say
its
not
too
bad
poured
a
nice
honey
gold
with
creamy
white
head
that
held
on
for
a
good
bit
smell
has
vibrant
citrus
mixed
with
a
little
vanilla
i
got
a
bit
of
a
chemical
taste
on
the
first
sip
but
the
lemony
hops
jumped
to
the
middle
of
my
tongue
quickly
good
bite
nice
dry
finish
that
lingers
just
a
little
bit
i
have
a
six
in
my
fridge
and
im
happy
knowing
its
there
ready
and
willing
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
weekend
with
me
o
overall
a
very
impressive
ipa
im
surprised
at
the
relatively
low
scores
this
is
a
beer
that
smells
divine
and
has
a
taste
that
matches
it
not
the
best
ever
but
id
be
happy
to
have
this
in
my
fridge
each
day
o
very
well
balanced
for
an
american
ipa
that
is
not
always
a
compliment
but
for
this
beer
it
is
even
certified
hop
heads
like
myself
should
check
this
out
solid
abv
as
well
12oz
bottle
pours
a
hazy
golden
amber
with
minimal
head
and
some
decent
clinging
lacing
aroma
is
light
with
some
pine
earthy
hints
yeasty
and
maybe
a
faint
nit
of
citrus
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodies
and
with
a
fair
amount
if
carbonation
taste
is
like
a
sweet
bread
with
some
earthiness
and
a
hint
of
pine
and
orange
peels
very
dry
this
is
a
slightly
different
tasting
ipa
it
is
worth
drinking
again
i
prefer
many
others
of
this
style
this
is
pretty
easygoing
for
an
ipa
and
although
i
couldnt
taste
the
alcohol
i
could
certainly
feel
it
once
i
finished
the
contents
of
my
glass
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
with
so
many
other
ipas
on
the
market
theres
no
real
reason
to
seek
this
out
i
could
picture
myself
having
one
of
these
on
a
summer
day
since
i
didnt
need
any
water
to
wash
this
down
but
otherwise
theres
nothing
particularly
memorable
about
this
beer
12oz
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
burnt
orange
with
a
medium
sized
head
fair
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
bready
sour
orange
peel
and
maybe
a
bit
earthy
flavor
is
like
a
bitter
brown
sugary
bread
kind
of
taste
some
hop
flavor
but
its
mixed
in
fair
amount
of
bitterness
somewhat
sour
orange
peel
flavor
peeks
out
at
the
end
this
doesnt
quite
taste
like
a
lot
of
the
ipas
out
there
overall
it
is
decent
but
ive
had
better
not
in
a
rush
to
have
it
again
o
average
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
nothing
to
run
out
and
buy
either
its
ok
d
very
drinkable
could
definitely
down
this
one
quickly
if
i
wanted
and
could
definitely
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
an
evening
pours
a
one
finger
head
body
is
copper
in
color
and
is
too
cloudy
to
see
through
it
looks
okay
on
the
nose
i
pick
up
primarily
a
sweet
smell
which
i
fear
is
the
malts
i
also
pick
up
a
small
hop
smells
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
i
should
be
smelling
in
an
american
ipa
im
worried
this
beer
will
have
too
much
malts
not
enough
hops
yeah
on
the
taste
you
dont
get
nearly
as
much
hop
taste
as
you
should
it
tastes
fairly
watered
down
to
be
honest
instead
of
a
lot
of
hops
it
just
tastes
like
water
with
a
little
sweetness
and
a
little
malts
and
then
a
tiny
tiny
bit
of
hops
this
should
not
be
considered
an
ipa
for
sure
the
most
disappointing
wolavers
i
have
had
all
there
other
beers
have
redeeming
qualities
the
only
redeeming
quality
to
this
beer
is
its
drinkability
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
for
the
right
reasons
it
is
a
goog
tasting
beer
and
pleasant
to
drink
however
it
just
doesnt
stick
out
from
the
pack
drinks
more
like
an
english
bitter
than
an
ipa
d
considering
its
strength
this
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
hidden
from
the
taste
d4
5
simple
taste
and
medium
body
make
this
very
drinkable
drinkability
is
ok
it
would
have
been
higher
except
for
that
weird
tinny
taste
that
isnt
going
away
caramel
and
a
decent
amont
of
hopping
the
malt
structure
is
too
much
though
for
this
it
clouds
the
hops
weighs
on
the
mouthfeel
grows
into
the
heavy
woody
feel
too
bad
how
it
finishes
it
starts
out
with
a
little
promise
drinkability
this
ipa
was
just
alright
the
heavier
body
and
dulled
flavor
profile
definitely
hurt
the
beers
drinkability
but
i
still
had
no
problem
finishing
it
d
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
very
different
for
an
ipa
i
would
like
more
hops
and
less
malt
but
still
a
good
beer
meh
taste
has
a
yeasty
mouldy
feel
to
it
throughout
in
spite
of
a
dominant
red
ale
maltiness
it
holds
very
light
bitter
finish
more
of
an
aftertaste
than
an
actual
finishing
edge
medium
bodied
rather
refreshing
than
filling
wellcarbonated
nice
brunchy
blend
quite
a
drinkable
beer
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
a
brighter
more
hoppy
ipa
d
not
particularly
great
but
not
bad
by
any
means
decent
drinkability
fairly
solid
throughout
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
little
bit
of
lacing
and
even
less
retension
slight
malty
sweet
aroma
coming
through
the
citrus
hops
in
the
nose
taste
is
bitter
upfront
and
has
a
nice
lingering
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
clings
to
the
tongue
thin
bodied
and
low
carb
but
still
enjoyable
not
much
of
a
wow
factor
but
a
soild
example
for
the
style
drinkability
is
good
while
i
am
not
blown
away
with
the
flavors
there
is
something
that
made
me
drink
this
one
pretty
fast
d
lackluster
for
the
style
as
this
would
fit
into
the
apa
category
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
slight
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
hops
and
some
piney
hops
along
with
a
sweet
malt
smell
the
taste
has
a
sweet
caramel
backbone
with
a
nice
citrus
and
pine
hop
bite
however
the
bite
fades
quickly
the
mouthfeel
is
of
moderate
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
solid
beer
but
not
one
of
the
best
ipas
that
you
will
ever
have
nothing
to
stand
out
about
it
but
nothing
to
make
you
dislike
it
either
notes
always
a
pleasure
to
find
this
craft
brews
sneaking
into
less
savvy
tap
selections
a
nice
ipa
that
with
a
smooth
and
apparent
lighter
early
taste
is
great
to
share
with
friends
starting
to
approach
the
style
while
this
is
easy
drinking
and
pleasing
it
is
not
outstanding
i
dont
really
consider
this
an
ipa
there
is
not
bitterness
if
i
had
to
guess
without
seeing
the
bottle
i
would
say
i
was
drinking
an
apa
d
drinks
great
will
definitely
be
getting
again
not
too
filling
or
too
rich
d
if
you
take
it
slow
its
pretty
good
the
taste
is
a
very
hoppy
with
substantial
grapefruit
overtones
lots
of
fruity
overtones
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
on
a
warm
day
i
could
drink
these
all
day
long
im
not
sure
if
i
prefer
this
to
sn
torpedo
or
commodore
perry
still
excellent
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
tiny
head
nice
aroma
of
hops
crisp
carbonation
with
nice
malt
and
hop
combo
but
not
extremely
hoppy
somewhat
of
a
metal
taste
mixed
with
the
hops
flavor
but
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
went
down
easy
and
is
quite
drinkable
other
comments
a
modest
wellbalanced
ipa
with
fantastic
drinkability
pours
a
pale
copper
hue
with
a
large
off
white
head
nice
retention
going
on
aroma
has
some
muted
pine
cone
with
a
spice
citrus
note
but
overall
has
a
sour
twang
with
earthy
hops
almost
tobacco
notes
flavors
have
sugary
pale
malts
with
a
burst
of
light
alcohol
hops
have
citrus
rind
and
pine
cone
tip
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
prett
lively
nice
dry
aftertaste
drinkability
is
solid
but
definitely
my
least
fave
out
of
the
3
i
tried
from
the
sampler
compared
to
the
pale
and
the
brown
ales
d
very
much
so
this
is
a
nice
touch
on
the
american
ipa
style
the
organic
factor
gives
you
something
to
thing
about
while
sipping
recommended
to
those
green
ipa
fans
around
the
nation
i
might
drink
again
but
will
most
likely
opt
out
for
more
punch
still
not
too
shabby
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
one
of
the
better
ipas
that
ive
had
but
its
still
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
of
the
many
ipas
ive
had
this
one
is
definitely
lower
tier
i
must
say
has
a
high
abv
but
where
are
the
hops
both
in
aroma
and
taste
you
dont
get
too
much
very
malty
i
also
found
this
beer
a
bit
watery
i
mean
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
good
tasting
beer
just
theres
a
lot
of
other
craft
beers
that
taste
much
better
the
whole
organic
thing
is
phooey
to
me
i
dont
believe
that
makes
anything
taste
better
but
look
to
otter
creek
or
long
trail
for
better
vermont
offerings
highly
malted
for
an
ipa
wheres
the
hops
some
spiciness
with
swallow
thin
grainy
mouthfeel
d
this
is
a
very
nice
ipa
yet
another
good
one
from
otter
creek
a
fine
member
of
the
wolavers
family
or
certified
organic
brews
the
flavor
might
build
and
be
too
much
for
some
ale
drinkers
but
theres
more
here
than
just
the
alcohol
bite
and
notable
hops
overall
very
interesting
ipa
the
flavor
is
phenomenal
light
clear
orange
body
with
sparse
effervescence
shortlived
white
head

to
glass
in
large
bubbles

perhaps
enough
of
an
ipa
to
demand
a
snifter
but
not
as
onpoint
as
their
pale
ale
and
not
as
malty
either
dcritiqueing
this
style
is
tough
the
beer
is
not
hoppy
enough
for
a
west
coast
apa
and
lacks
the
malty
goodness
of
a
true
british
ipa
i
think
that
a
beer
that
wants
to
be
organic
is
great
however
it
tastes
like
a
standard
recipe
with
organic
ingredients
it
seems
like
its
weak
on
all
fronts
good
flavor
dont
get
me
wrong
just
not
enough
of
it
d
overall
not
bad
just
a
bit
tame
per
style
an
organic
beer
should
focus
more
on
malt
quality
then
producing
a
middle
of
the
road
standard
west
coast
ipa
that
gets
lost
amongst
the
numerous
others
d
its
a
good
try
ive
definately
had
much
worse
all
these
organic
beers
seem
to
always
have
something
off
about
them
there
are
bettercheaper
ipas
out
there
so
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
kudos
for
the
organic
thing
though
mouthfeel
was
fine
as
was
drinkability
but
not
a
great
ipa
overall
disapppointing
as
ive
had
other
organic
ipas
and
really
enjoyed
them
pours
an
orange
yellow
color
with
a
haze
and
a
nice
white
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
bit
smells
of
spices
and
hops
actually
a
pretty
crisp
and
refreshing
taste
of
there
were
hops
but
not
overpowering
it
was
a
good
blend
with
the
spices
too
went
down
on
and
mouthfeel
was
alright
i
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
but
id
say
give
it
a
shot
pours
a
clear
lighter
amber
nose
is
very
similar
to
the
pale
ale
light
with
a
slight
nutty
tone
flavor
has
an
earthy
brightness
to
it
very
well
balanced
real
distinct
mature
flavor
tones
thick
but
not
overdone
maltiness
feel
is
thick
on
the
liquid
body
and
an
even
carbonation
hmmmm
a
tasty
ipa
another
nice
one
from
this
brewery
like
this
much
better
than
the
pa
from
the
same
brewery
still
leaning
towards
the
brit
style
of
hoppy
ale
lighter
in
color
than
the
pa
as
well
more
head
and
lace
too
alcohol
is
very
noticable
biscuity
character
of
the
munich
malt
stands
out
ok
beer
a
pretty
good
beer
because
i
do
like
the
style
but
not
really
anything
special
golden
almost
orange
color
with
a
nice
head
and
lots
of
lace
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
with
a
little
hops
and
vanilla
the
flavor
is
sweet
grapefruit
but
not
as
hoppy
as
i
thought
it
would
be
some
crisp
bitterness
bottle
poured
a
light
brown
color
ale
with
some
orangey
notes
and
nice
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
consists
of
very
light
bitter
hops
which
are
disappointing
considering
the
style
taste
is
a
mix
between
a
bland
light
caramel
malt
profiles
with
a
very
light
bitter
finish
i
expect
some
bitter
or
citrus
flavour
in
my
ipa
which
i
didnt
get
here
i
have
to
admit
that
this
one
was
a
big
disappointment
drinkability
i
liked
it
it
is
an
overall
good
balanced
beer
d
very
drinkable
hey
its
certified
organic
pass
the
tofu
this
poured
a
clear
gold
with
a
bit
of
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
barley
malt
with
citrus
and
copper
hops
it
tasted
like
bold
copper
hops
and
earthy
malted
barley
with
some
licorice
it
was
slightly
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
somewhat
lasting
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
had
pretty
good
flavor
and
a
clean
taste
with
decent
body
but
it
didnt
have
any
real
depth
or
unique
character
drinkability
is
very
nice
the
good
hop
taste
is
dimmed
down
by
the
caramel
malts
balancing
the
beer
very
nice
a
very
impressive
ipa
especially
for
an
organic
i
guess
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
because
it
is
a
bi
muted
in
flavor
decent
representation
but
you
can
do
better
d
nice
and
drinkable
maybe
more
of
a
birtish
ipa
out
of
the
mixer
i
think
i
liked
the
pale
ale
the
best
but
over
all
i
think
this
is
a
nice
branch
of
otter
creek
dont
drink
and
review
i
dont
knowif
the
surroundings
had
anything
to
do
with
it
or
what
but
this
wasone
fine
beer
overall
pretty
good
one
of
the
better
organic
ipas
that
ive
had
it
still
has
a
little
ways
to
go
to
be
a
truly
great
ipa
but
it
is
more
than
acceptable
if
youre
into
the
organic
thing
which
i
am
as
far
as
food
is
concerned
this
is
well
worth
trying
otherwise
id
recommend
getting
some
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
it
d
very
drinkable
6
5
is
surprising
but
will
help
you
get
to
where
you
want
to
be
heh
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
much
better
feels
fizzy
with
a
bite
at
the
end
its
really
more
like
a
pilsner
than
an
ipa
better
as
it
warms
but
disappointing
d
a
pleasant
surprise
and
a
pretty
tasty
brew
this
is
a
mild
ipa
and
doesnt
really
compare
to
the
west
coast
styles
but
all
in
all
it
is
very
good
and
definitely
worth
a
try
i
dould
drink
several
of
these
bad
boys
d
this
is
the
definition
of
a
session
ipa
i
really
cant
say
a
negitave
thing
about
this
beer
this
is
the
second
wolavers
ive
had
and
both
have
been
outstanding
i
mean
are
there
better
ipas
out
there
of
course
there
are
but
this
is
straight
and
to
the
point
enjoyable
highly
recommended
it
does
flatten
a
bit
near
the
end
a
disappointment
in
sum
a
decent
ipa
one
worth
trying
there
are
far
better
examples
of
the
style
for
certain
overall
a
nice
and
fresh
beer
i
enjoyed
the
caramel
and
floral
mix
not
as
hoppy
as
most
ipas
recommended
pours
a
medium
amber
with
bright
lighter
amber
highlights
little
head
but
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
a
very
balanced
blend
of
caramel
malts
and
lifting
citrusy
hops
things
are
downplayed
though
compared
to
a
lot
of
ipas
and
the
major
effect
is
one
of
light
sweet
malts
with
a
light
dose
of
hops
in
the
background
that
lighten
the
proceedings
and
give
an
impression
of
aromatic
suspension
on
the
palate
malt
sweetness
first
off
before
the
hops
come
through
midway
in
from
the
middle
to
the
end
theres
an
excellent
integration
of
hops
and
malt
with
each
one
showing
its
character
while
meshing
with
the
other
well
done
mouthfeel
is
very
good
with
an
excellent
balance
of
carbonation
acidity
and
weight
overall
this
is
a
damn
tasty
beer
very
good
the
low
point
is
the
aroma
which
to
my
olfactory
senses
is
slightly
skunked
until
the
beer
settles
in
a
bit
too
grapefruity
slightly
cloying
maltishness
and
not
enticing
things
improve
as
the
beer
settles
but
the
opening
act
is
critical
for
me
that
said
the
appearance
is
the
high
note
the
beer
is
a
nice
amber
with
a
bubbly
white
head
moderately
carbonated
medium
bodied
a
bit
syrupy
in
consistency
and
well
balanced
you
will
get
some
grapefruity
slightly
tangy
hop
tastes
balanced
against
some
bready
sweet
malts
maybe
some
dextrin
malts
the
aftertaste
is
mild
and
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
brilliant
this
beer
definitely
improves
with
settling
with
more
balance
and
more
moderation
in
character
mouthfeel
is
rich
enough
and
crisp
drinkability
is
great
no
hint
of
higher
alcohol
smooth
and
rich
enough
with
a
very
pleasant
taste
drinkability
is
solid
a
great
beer
from
wolavers
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
not
a
hopheads
ipa
but
a
very
well
done
and
highly
drinkable
version
d
easy
to
drink
but
not
tasty
enough
to
think
about
but
it
was
free
sad
to
say
but
this
ipa
that
i
looked
forward
to
due
to
using
some
of
my
favorite
varieties
of
hops
was
kind
of
a
let
down
d
if
you
like
ipa
then
i
say
this
one
is
a
good
all
around
because
its
not
as
heavy
as
a
regular
810
ipa
great
beer
eh
its
a
passable
ipa
but
not
anything
worth
seeking
out
ive
found
this
to
be
the
case
with
every
wolavers
ive
had
which
is
strange
because
i
like
most
of
otter
creeks
stuff
the
balance
of
flavours
makes
this
seem
a
little
too
bitter
for
my
liking
otherwise
a
smooth
slick
body
with
a
bright
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
nice
ipa
i
have
of
course
had
better
and
also
had
much
much
worse
but
this
one
will
definitely
work
i
was
surprised
by
the
balance
it
posed
not
simply
relying
on
a
ton
of
hops
to
push
through
the
flavor
a
really
nice
choice
and
a
good
call
overall
this
is
an
above
average
american
ipa
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
unless
you
were
looking
for
an
organic
brew
it
poured
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
had
some
pretty
good
retention
to
it
nice
and
malty
and
moderately
hoppy
the
after
taste
was
about
the
same
over
all
it
the
flavor
was
a
tad
watery
just
kinda
bitter
the
beer
had
a
medium
body
to
it
and
was
drinkable
maybe
not
my
favorite
ipa
but
it
was
a
solid
beer
regardless
at
one
point
i
actually
went
and
looked
at
the
bottle
to
see
if
it
really
was
listed
as
an
ipa
could
have
much
more
easily
passed
as
an
english
ale
again
not
bad
just
not
an
ipa
overall
a
solid
ipa
probably
not
as
bold
as
other
hoppier
ipas
but
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
probably
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
for
folks
who
arent
usually
into
hoppy
beers
nevertheless
this
brew
can
stand
out
on
its
own
for
exhibiting
a
solid
balance
of
hops
and
malts
with
a
pleasurable
tangysweet
taste
this
is
a
good
looking
beer
nice
darker
amber
beer
under
a
good
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
with
herbal
pine
and
some
citrus
everything
an
ipa
should
be
taste
matches
to
the
t
hops
hit
the
palate
first
but
sweet
malt
flavors
show
up
later
on
just
a
great
tasting
beer
mouthfeel
was
moderate
with
enough
carbonation
easy
drinking
for
an
ipa
balance
all
around
unique
as
well
recommended
very
smooth
with
appropriate
carbonation
nice
and
organic
to
boot
wow
what
a
pleasant
surprise
this
hazey
amber
ale
had
a
big
beautiful
offwhite
head
with
great
frothy
lacing
chewy
looking
already
the
aroma
just
adds
to
the
suspense
with
an
incredible
carmel
and
butterscotch
sweetness
mixed
with
malt
the
hops
are
a
little
tough
to
detect
in
the
aroma
but
there
is
some
piney
presence
but
it
smells
like
its
more
toward
a
brown
ale
than
an
ipa
but
then
the
first
taste
brings
out
a
unique
blend
of
the
bitter
hops
and
the
creamy
butterscotch
good
stuff
it
has
a
slick
and
silky
feel
full
bodied
milkshakelike
just
a
slight
bite
from
the
hops
but
for
the
most
part
this
is
a
mellow
mouthful
of
complex
flavor
this
is
a
great
change
of
pace
in
the
world
of
quality
ipas
there
is
an
unusual
dr
pepper
like
quality
but
i
obviously
like
it
very
different
very
good
overall
a
very
good
well
balanced
ipa
this
beer
is
not
only
hoppy
not
overly
so
but
extremely
flavorful
it
has
a
very
very
small
hint
of
sweetness
very
full
flavor
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
one
of
these
ales
but
i
am
enjoying
one
now
and
it
is
delicious
i
am
an
avid
ipa
drinker
and
rate
this
one
in
the
top
2
or
3
on
my
list
this
well
made
india
pale
ale
could
pass
as
a
superbly
dry
hopped
pale
ale
because
of
the
malt
balance
in
the
nose
and
flavor
the
hops
usedmagnumcrystal
and
hallertauer
give
a
unique
hop
profile
not
usually
found
in
domestic
ipas
bitter
lemon
iced
tea
flavors
and
the
unmistakable
flowery
herbal
aroma
and
bitter
taste
of
hallertauer
hops
mix
well
with
the
perfectly
malted
barley
aromas
and
flavors
that
include
caramel
and
toasted
grain
a
slight
alcohol
warmth
rounds
out
the
flavor
great
head
lace
and
carbonation
which
is
smooth
to
creamy
show
this
really
is
a
well
crafted
brew
oh
and
its
organic
which
means
little
to
some
and
much
to
others
this
along
with
the
oatmeal
stout
wolavers
produces
ends
the
question
of
whether
superb
beers
can
be
made
organically
the
answer
is
yes
more
rich
and
malty
than
expected
still
a
smooth
and
enjoyable
brew
flavor
sports
the
hops
up
front
with
a
subtle
sweet
malty
character
in
the
back
hints
of
orange
freshly
cut
wood
earthy
spices
the
fact
that
the
hops
are
not
as
intense
allows
some
of
the
subtlety
shine
through
as
it
warmed
the
hops
became
stronger
and
spicier
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
to
medium
bodied
a
bit
syrupy
its
not
very
drinkable
as
it
just
doesnt
taste
all
that
good
overall
its
very
average
d
a
reasonably
well
balanced
ipa
not
overly
hoppy
nor
sweet
drinkability
not
too
bad
for
an
ipa
but
nothing
special
either
i
know
ive
had
better
organic
ipas
but
this
one
does
try
this
is
a
nice
clean
but
average
ipa
its
good
but
not
great
if
you
know
what
i
mean
theres
a
nice
caramel
malt
backbone
over
american
citrusy
hops
thats
fairly
drinkable
to
anyone
thats
into
the
style
try
this
one
if
its
local
or
if
youre
into
organic
beer
otherwise
its
just
another
good
ipa
im
on
record
as
deploring
the
breakfast
citrus
trend
that
seems
to
be
taking
over
so
much
american
craft
beer
but
this
one
isnt
overdone

this

even

held
onto

go
organic
overall
this
is
a

of
the
its

to
be
malty
school
of
thought
if
the
lack
of
overwhelming
american
hops
doesnt
bother
you
then
give
this
beer
a
try
all
the
more
so
if
you
find
the

astringent
with
generous
and

addiing
to
it
drinkability
is
ok
but
this
ale
seems
a
little
onedimensional
to
me
the
flavor
is
nothing
extraordinary
and
the
lack
of
balancing
malts
is
disappointing
enough
that
i
dont
know
if
id
get
another
sixer
of
this
there
are
plenty
of
ipas
out
there
that
offer
more
for
my
tastes
from
the
brewers
of
otter
creek
this
certified
organic
ipa
pours
a
golden
orange
color
thin
head
and
a
noticeable
but
somewhat
watery
lace
is
left
as
it
drains
floral
hoppy
aroma
with
hints
of
citrus
deep
down
a
nice
hoppy
flavor
with
a
decent
malted
undertone
and
a
slight
alcohol
finish
kind
of
a
woody
aftertaste
which
im
not
all
that
crazy
about
but
isnt
offensive
i
feel
like
im
missing
something
else
here
but
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
not
a
bad
mouthfeel
and
an
entirely
drinkable
ipa
there
are
better
ipas
out
there
which
are
readily
accessible
however
and
while
i
like
the
wolavers
line
in
general
i
wouldnt
specifically
seek
them
out
but
a
nice
beer
nonetheless
halfway
through
and
theres
very
little
trace
of
hop
aroma
and
then
the
malt
takes
over
tastes
o
k
but
there
are
plenty
of
better
options
for
an
american
ipa
i
will
not
seek
this
out
again
but
if
we
cross
paths
i
can
consume
it
i
guess
im
indifferent
solid
ipa
bitterness
and
finish
a
little
astringent
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
okay
but
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
dryer
among
the
best
organic
ales
ive
ever
had
although
thats
not
really
saying
much
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
but
not
quite
top
notch
the
smell
has
plenty
of
hops
but
it
isnt
a
good
combination
also
it
has
a
burnt
and
stale
flavor
the
taste
is
no
better
it
starts
with
burnt
malt
flavors
and
an
unappealing
type
of
bitterness
takes
over
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
though
so
far
where
im
from
this
beer
is
easy
to
get
a
plus

with
a

clean
with

flavor
left
to
beg
for
the
next
sip
well
balanced
for
an
ipa
maybe
not
the
most
impressive
sample
of
the
style
but
still
a
solid
one
a
6pack
of
these
would
go
down
very
easy
on
warm
day
with
a
juicy
burger
or
any
good
barbecue
for
that
matter

with

fads
to
a

smells

hoppy

with
good

are
overly

stand
to
be
a
little
heavier
a
very
drinkable

cheers
in
short
its
local
cheap
organic
and
a
tasty
beer
to
boot
whats
not
to
love
a
good
drinkable
ipa
not
something
to
have
if
you
are
really
a
hop
fanatic
but
especially
enjoyable
if
you
like
more
mild
ipas
as
i
do
and
if
you
are
organicallyinclined
its
even
more
of
a
reason
to
try
it
what
started
out
as
a
very
attractive
beer
slowly
or
maybe
rapidly
went
downhill
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
monstrous
slightly
offwhite
puffy
head
beautiful
lacing
smell
is
a
a
bit
hoppy
a
bit
malty
mixed
with
alcohol
notes
taste
is
very
strange
i
detect
a
strong
hop
bitterness
which
slowly
fades
into
a
very
unpleasant
taste
that
is
difficult
to
get
out
of
the
mouth
each
taste
erases
it
but
then
it
slowly
resturns
gets
a
little
better
as
it
warmed
to
at
least
allow
me
to
finish
it
never
again
rich
burnished
gold
with
a
short
eggshell
head
of
tiny
bubbles
that
quickly
collapsed
leaving
a
single
disc
of
fine
dust
several
jetting
carbonation
streams
are
visible
thick
strands
of
lacing
trailed
the
sides
of
the
glass
rich
resiny
pine
and
citrus
notes
with
some
residual
malt
dominate
the
smell
and
there
is
also
a
spicy
hint
as
well
rich
with
lightly
roasted
malt
up
front
which
is
quickly
followed
by
the
piney
hop
bite
finishes
with
a
slight
citrusy
edge
but
that
is
balanced
with
the
modest
malt
body
the
crispness
lingers
in
a
pleasing
way
medium
body
with
a
light
tight
mouthfeel
relatively
gentle
carbonation
well
done
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
not
great
but
drinkable
the
taste
is
a
bit
off
for
an
ipa
long
on
malt
and
short
on
hops
this
beer
is
not
available
in
my
area
so
i
probably
wont
have
it
again
crux
organic
ipa
is
a
pale
ale
mustve
been
an
organic
hop
shortage
when
they
made
this
brew
when
they
throw
a
lot
more
organic
hops
into
this
beer
ill
gladly
buy
it
and
drink
it
without
reservation
guess
ill
stick
with
my
arsenal
of
nonorganic
ipas
for
now
this
is
as
stated
a
decent
but
basic
brew
hops
and
malt
are
well
balanced
and
it
definitely
falls
more
in
line
with
an
englishstyle
ipa
as
opposed
to
an
americanstyle
one
freshness
date
of
21506
poured
with
an
inch
of
white
head
raw
hops
and
earthy
aroma
pale
orange
in
color
very
clear
bitter
and
dry
lacks
a
balanced
and
distinctive
hop
flavor
that
i
have
come
to
enjoy
in
other
ipas
and
from
what
i
read
the
choice
of
organic
hops
available
to
brewers
is
extremely
small
i
hope
this
changes
in
the
future
as
i
believe
there
is
promise
in
this
brew
not
as
sweet
as
other
ipas
which
can
be
a
welcome
change
overall
it
wasnt
quite
what
i
expected
being
my
first
organic
beer
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
robust
flavor
the
ideal
of
organic
products
does
appeals
to
me
and
i
hope
more
breweries
will
try
their
hand
in
the
production
of
organic
beers
in
the
future
this
beer
had
little
head
the
color
was
an
orangish
amber
and
it
was
slightly
cloudy
the
smell
is
a
sweet
piney
smell
the
taste
is
fairly
bitter
with
a
nice
lasting
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
there
is
a
bittersweet
that
lasts
for
a
while
the
drinkability
is
good
i
could
certainly
drink
this
brew
again
another
fine
offering
from
vermont
a
good
representation
of
the
style
pours
a
goldenorangeish
color
with
a
poofy
white
head
super
clear
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
pilsner
or
lager
smell
is
sweet
and
hoppy
some
sourness
in
the
form
of
a
zesty
citrusness
but
something
is
a
bit
off
and
its
kind
of
boring
taste
is
not
as
hoppy
as
an
ipa
should
be
grassy
and
floral
and
kind
of
bitter
mouthfeel
is
oily
and
slick
and
very
wet
bubbly
and
sort
of
frothy
its
an
easy

a

all
i
can
think

to

it

not

the
flavor
that
is
there
has
a

kind
of
burny
character
that
i
think
i
was
smelling
i
kind
of
disagree
with
the
characterization
of
this
beer
as
an
americanstyle
ipa
it
may
use
american
hops
but
the
bitterbalance
and
relatively
tame
hop
taste
make
it
seem
more
like
one
of
the
brits
interestingly
this
all
resolves
to
a
splendid
aftertaste
i
like
each
sip
better
after
its
gone
id
try
it
again
but
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
on
a
different
note
kudos
to
wolavers
for
putting
the
bottled
on
date
on
their
beers
this
one
bottled
on
111005
organic
thanks
for
sharin
but
this
camp
aint
carin
seriously
the
whole
organic
campaign
is
a
joke
there
are
tons
of
beers
that
are
organic
and
dont
put
it
on
their
label
who
cares
overall
nothing
to
see
here
please
move
along

is
also

is

far
from

ipa
by
wolavers
a
good
flavored
ipa
not
a
hop
monster
by
any
means
but
flavorfully
hoppy
and
organic
is
a
good
combination
in
my
book
m
d
mouthfeel
is
good
as
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
with
a
pretty
good
hop
malt
relationship
the
dryness
of
the
finish
was
unexpected
but
welcomed
i
would
think
the
drinkability
would
be
high
on
this
offering
from
wolavers
a
pretty
solid
ipa
i
was
pleased
with
this
beer
im
sure
it
would
be
much
better
fresh
mine
was
from
the
dollar
bin
of
assorted
singles
it
has
everything
i
love
in
a
good
american
ipa
perhaps
not
in
perfect
balance
though
nevertheless
id
buy
it
again
in
any
case
its
an
ok
attempt
at
the
style
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
away
to
get
this
one
though
easy
to
drink
and
reasonabley
refreshing
but
not
quite
right
for
the
style
revisiting
this
2
yrs
later
i
enjoyed
it
much
more
a
good
solid
ipa
delivering
an
abundant
yet
not
oppressive
amount
of
hops
balanced
by
just
the
right
malt
profile
becoming
my
regular
drinker
at
a
local
hangout
best
had
ontap
this
copper
colored
brew
was
served
with
a
two
finger
head
that
left
plenty
of
lacing
nose
had
a
citrus

aromavery
nice
taste
started
with
a
biscuity
malt
but
was
taken
over
by
a
light
floral
citrusy
hops
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
and
the
carbonation
was
ok
overall
drinkability
was
ok
this
was
a
nice
beer
biscuity
sweet
grain
blend
with
a

reminds
me
of

abv
lets
start
with
the
smell
its
strong
but
what
is
it
burnt
corn
stalks
burnt
newspaper
something
burnt
something
not
right
then
the
tasteyeah
it
could
be
corn
stalks
or
newspaper
its
the
hops
that
are
the
culpritthey
dont
taste
like
hops
in
beer
more
like
hops
eaten
straight
off
the
cone
which
i
did
out
of
curiosity
at
a
recent
sam
adams
brewery
tour
i
do
recommend
that
you
eat
at
least
one
hops
cone
in
your
life
just
to
see
what
its
like
and
to
say
that
you
did
but
i
cant
recommend
that
you
try
this
beer
apart
from
the
hops
this
beer
looks
and
tastes
weak
and
thin
just
in
case
you
were
wondering
overall
not
a
good
1
sometimes
organic
isnt
always
better
drinkable
yes
i
would
have
to
rank
this
as
an
entry
level
ipa
however
i
know
this
bottle
of
wolavers
india
pale
ale
is
reasonably
fresh
and
has
been
well
cared
for
thats
because
it
was
hand
carried
from
the
brewery
to
me
when
it
was
less
than
one
month
old
mores
the
pity
and
the
sheer
stupifying
wonder
that
it
tastes
so
bad
im
still
willing
to
give
otter
creekwolavers
more
chances
because
a
good
portion
of
what
they
brew
is
decent
but
this
one
never
again
this
is
my
first
wolavers
variety
from
otter
creek
and
first
strictly
organic
beer
in
general
a
very
agreeable
ipa
not
anything
amazing
but
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
and
be
perfectly
happy
this
is
the
first
of
the
otter
creek
organic
beers
that
ive
had
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
was
pleasantly
suprised
id
get
it
again
another
tasty
beer
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
worth
a
try

nice
but
alas
looks

are
in

are
very
deceiving

in
my
quest
to
find
a
decent
tasting
organic
ipa

of
piney
hops
grass
and
floral
notes
very
crisp

with

tasty
and
enjoyable
but
not
exactly

to
mtnlover
for
this
bottle
thanks
to

for
providing
this

a

that
quickly
settled
to
a

over
the

liquid
smells
of

apricto
peaches
caramel
and
a
hint
of
grapefruit

taste
the
hops
are
too
mild
for
an
ipa
wet
sweet
with
fruits
mostly
starts
apricot
sweet
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
caramle
a

in

carrying

and
woody
qualities
grassy
cohumulone

immediately
after
swallowing
i
get
a
moment
of
grapefruit
hop
but
this
quickly
changes
to
a
more
metallic
and
woody
hop
that
starts
the
aftertaste
the
aftertaste
is
more
bitter
than
during
the
taste
and
is
accompanied
by
a
pleasing
gentle
caronbation
sting
on
the
whole
flat
of
my
tongue

mouthfeel
and
mildly
cabonated
the
final
sips
were
taken
after
allowing
the
beer
to
warm
a
while
grapoefruit
pith
is
more
prevalent
and
hits
earlier
the
malt
and
fruity
sweet
are
still
there
and
id
say
all
is
in
balance
for
and
apa
a
pleasure
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
evening
mouthfeel
is
good
decent
carbonation
nothing
really
to
get
worked
up
about
drinkability
is
good
this
would
be
a
decent
session
beer
although
the
abv
might
put
it
out
of
that
realm
for
some
over
all
a
good
to
solid
ipa
nothing
to
go
nuts
over
but
a
decent
choice
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
leaves
spidery
lacing
down
the
glass
smell
is
floral
hops
with
a
light
biscuit
background
pretty
average
for
an
ipa
of
this
strength
the
taste
is
grassy
resiny
hops
with
a
light
floral
background
and
a
bready
malt
backbone
that
balances
the
beer
a
little
the
hops
werent
really
as
big
or
complex
as
i
was
expecting
really
a
middle
of
the
road
ipa
in
my
book
the
carbonation
is
somewhat
high
for
an
ipa
and
it
makes
it
refreshing
and
crisp
but
the
finish
is
dry
and
not
bitter
enough
in
my
opinion
a
descent
brew
but
nothing
special
wolavers
ipa
is
a
crisp
flavorful
and
rejuvenating
golden
ale
with
a
longstanding
head
of
bright
white
froth
and
a
nose
that
welcomes
you
without
screaming
at
you
its
both
malty
and
hoppy
without
particularily
leaning
to
either
side
its
solid
malt
base
is
peppered
with
grassy
and
spicy
hops
and
its
delicately
zesty
carbonation
and
solid
bitterness
help
to
bring
that
spiciness
out
before
it
fades
into
a
long
lasting
bitter
end
it
may
be
a
bit
mainstream
as
far
as
ipas
go
but
its
certainly
very
well
done
wolavers
organic
ipa
pours
a
very
light
clear
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
small
bubbles
rise
throughout
the
beer
over
the
course
of
the
pint
aroma
is
hoppy
and
citrusy
with
some
slight
butterywheaty
notes
not
as
agressive
in
the
nose
as
i
would
like
to
see
in
an
american
ipa
taste
well
if
i
didnt
know
better
id
say
this
beer
had
some
wheat
in
it
but
other
than
a
body
that
was
a
bit
too
light
the
beer
is
quite
hoppy
and
a
good
session
beer
i
have
heard
that
ingredients
for
organic
brewing
can
be
limited
and
this
is
a
pretty
good
stab
at
an
ipa
ill
definitely
pick
it
up
again
but
it
is
nowhere
near
as
good
as
their
organic
oatmeal
stout
p
s
after
reading
other
reviews
i
dont
know
what
to
say
whether
there
were
issues
with
other
batches
or
freshness
problems
but
this
bottle
was
nothing
but
fine
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
34
offwhite
head
over
the
clear
golden
brew
head
is
fluffy
and
fades
relatively
slowly
with
nice
lacing
aroma
is
lightly
of
sweet
pale
malts
with
a
touch
of
citrusy
hops
the
taste
is
upfront
with
slight
sweetness
quickly
giving
way
to
somewhat
grassy
and
citrusy
bitterness
of
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
knocked
due
to
the
mundane
bitter
aftertaste
i
expect
so
much
more
from
wellhopped
ipas
drinkability
is
alright
i
know
the
organic
label
sells
a
product
for
some
but
to
me
were
looking
at
the
final
product
not
necessarily
how
what
went
into
it
was
grown
in
my
mind
theres
better
ipas
to
check
out
before
this
one
but
its
still
not
a
bad
ipa
just
could
be
better
drinkability
is
well
ok
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
or
probably
any
choice
again
but
it
is
a
change
from
the
west
coast
ipas
i
happen
to
love
this
beer
seems
more
of
the
english
style
than
the
american
and
thats
cool
caramel
malts
and
mild
hop
varieties
make
for
a
refreshing
brew
this
is
not
the
typical
hop
dominant
beer
that
i
look
for
in
an
ipa
it
was
fairly
tasty
and
easily
drinkable
but
also
nondescript
and
easily
forgettable
bottled
on
110904
a
nice
head
about
1
12
fingers
that
held
up
well
and
left
clinging
rings
a
very
floral
aroma
with
no
detectable
alchol
tones
i
was
quite
excited
to
take
a
sip
the
taste
is
equally
floral
and
starts
out
a
bit
sweet
much
weaker
hop
impact
than
i
had
hoped
for
where
are
my
hops
the
beer
feels
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
finishes
clean
with
no
lingering
hop
aftertaste
there
are
much
worse
but
for
the
price
there
are
also
much
better
ipas
on
the
shelves
not
sure
if
i
should
actually
list
this
brew
here
but
will
it
is
the
wolvers
ipa
but
is
from
one
of
the
special
batches
that
is
only
available
at
the
brewery
to
bring
home
in
growlers
it
is
a
batch
of
only
four
barrels
called
cask
conditioned
wolvers
ipa
and
from
what
i
was
told
they
where
agedmatured
in
chardonnay
barrels
it
definitely
had
the
qualities
of
the
wolvers
ipa
but
also
did
poses
a
chardonnay
like
aroma
and
taste
the
brew
held
up
nicely
in
the
growler
for
a
few
days
and
when
poured
had
a
slightly
cloudy
orangeyellow
color
with
a
nice
sized
white
head
that
had
pretty
good
retention
and
left
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
had
a
very
robust
hop
scent
that
did
dominate
but
you
where
able
to
pick
up
notes
of
malt
and
toffee
and
the
chardonnay
aroma
that
i
talked
about
before
the
taste
was
also
dominated
by
the
hops
but
did
seem
to
be
more
refined
than
with
the
initial
smell
the
hop
flavors
are
of
pine
and
citrus
but
i
feel
that
the
pine
notes
win
out
also
notice
some
nice
fruit
like
characteristics
that
go
well
with
the
hop
taste
also
notice
a
pretty
good
amount
of
malt
that
balances
it
out
quite
well
i
must
say
that
this
was
a
good
brew
wish
that
i
lived
closer
to
middlebury
to
try
some
of
the
other
brewery
specific
concoctions
i
was
told
that
some
of
the
brewery
only
offerings
could
possibly
make
its
way
out
into
distribution
as
a
specialseasonal
series
lets
hope
so
pouring
from
a
bottle
into
a
goblet
it
poured
a
beautiful
goldenamber
color
w
a
nice
2cm
of
foamy
sticky
looking
head
that
clung
to
the
glass
like
spiderman
on
jane
leaving
nice
latticework
or
lacing
on
my
glass
the
head
did
dissipate
some
leaving
a
nice
edge
layer
around
the
top
of
the
beverage
taking
a
few
whiffs
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
to
find
that
this
ipa
was
not
all
hops
as
i
had
suspected
but
had
more
hints
of
fruit
white
grapes
or
plums
and
even
had
some
semblance
of
chocolate
in
there
somewhere
which
i
found
very
intriguing
slight
alcohol
tingled
my
nosehair
a
bit
as
well
which
is
always
fun
for
me
when
i
drink
a
beer
taking
a
sip
it
came
to
my
palette
very
sweet
natured
with
little
hops
at
first
the
white
grapes
really
jumped
out
at
the
tip
of
my
tongue
w
some
sugary
taste
but
then
gave
way
to
a
nice
earthy
hops
flavor
that
covered
my
palette
on
back
until
the
swallow
upon
swallowing
this
left
a
nice
sweet
floweriness
if
i
can
describe
it
any
better
and
left
a
nice
grassy
aftertaste
reminding
me
of
cut
grass
in
spring
or
summer
one
knock
on
this
one
was
the
feel
of
it
however
its
high
carbonation
beat
on
my
palette
pretty
hard
and
it
never
really
gives
way
until
the
swallow
which
may
have
taken
away
from
some
of
the
flavor
however
i
got
much
more
than
i
expected
from
this
one
and
it
was
a
very
nice
crispy
ale
w
a
sneaky
little
6
5
alcohol
that
i
would
recommend
to
just
about
anyone
one
inch
of
creamy
dense
foam
sits
on
a
slightly
hazy
reddish
brown
beer
sticky
strata
of
lacing
sweet
milk
chocolate
aroma
a
chocolate
floral
front
with
a
deep
malty
milky
middle
fairly
bitter
tangy
chocolate
finish
with
some
celery
i
kind
of
like
this
a
chocolatey
bitter
hoppy
beer
final
thought
not
a
bad
brew
from
the
ocwolaver
group
this
doesnt
bowl
you
over
but
is
done
well
in
all
categories
good
session
beer
in
the
fallwinter
just
enough
to
cut
spicy

fresh
beer
pours
a
clear
golder
amber
white
head
leaves
light
wispy
lacing
full
hoppy
grainy
nose
maybe
also
a
note
of
rye
medium
bodied
grainy
dry
hops
up
front
maybe
a
tad
thin
in
the
malt
to
smooth
this
one
out
still
a
drinkable
ale
long
lasting
bitter
and
drying
hops
on
the
tongue
worth
a
try
decent
sessioner
clear
reddish
gold
under
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
lingers
nicely
and
leaves
very
good
lace
rings
nice
crisp
clean
nose
with
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
and
a
good
dose
of
flowery
hops
the
mouth
is
very
prickly
and
fairly
heavy
the
taste
character
is
strongly
of
flowers
with
a
touch
of
pine
and
espresso
the
malt
is
subdued
but
noticeable
sweet
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
while
the
hops
bite
at
the
back
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
dry
and
mildly
bitter
the
whole
thing
is
quite
smooth
more
a
british
ipa
than
an
american
really
straight
fours
down
the
line
nice
pour
and
lacing
but
nothing
too
remarkable
taste
is
good
and
citrusy
without
being
overly
piney
actually
the
malt
reall
balances
it
out
but
i
think
its
just
a
wee
bit
too
much
malt
for
my
liking
reminds
me
of
other
nice
ipas
in
this
style
nicely
balanced
and
as
malty
as
they
are
hoppy
quaffability
is
nice
the
organic
designation
doesnt
really
affect
quality
but
its
nice
to
have
such
environmentally
conscious
brewers
medium
bodied
and
mellow
maltiness
usher
in
the
first
sips
and
mix
with
notes
of
caramel
and
light
dried
fruits
no
real
sign
of
hops
but
a
subdued
bitterness
lurks
in
the
back
to
remind
us
that
this
is
an
ipa
finishes
rather
cleanly
would
definitely
like
to
sample
a
fresh
example
and
when
i
do
will
update
this
review
this
is
a
good
beer
from
wolavers
pouring
medium
gold
with
high
head
and
excellent
lacing
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
bright
hop
aroma
with
citric
flavors
the
beer
itself
is
quite
light
in
color
and
maltiness
to
make
way
for
a
hop
showcase
that
is
neither
flashy
nor
gaudy
just
a
brisk
enjoyable
crispness
and
a
bit
of
grapefruity
prickle
a
solid
beer
not
very
characterful
but
definitely
tasty
i
would
like
perhaps
a
somewhat
larger
malt
profile
but
this
is
a
minor
quibble
i
first
had
a
wolaver
beer
a
few
years
ago
and
thought
it
was
insipid
lacking
flavor
perhaps
due
to
the
organic
ingredients
this
is
happily
not
the
case
now
i
dont
know
if
they
have
improved
their
craft
or
if
it
was
the
switch
to
otter
creek
in
middlebury
vt
but
this
beer
has
as
much
substance
as
need
be
this
is
a
fairly
mild
ipa
i
expected
more
from
otter
creek
it
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
medium
head
and
little
lacing
there
is
more
of
the
malt
in
the
nose
than
the
hops
that
i
expected
it
is
a
nice
rounded
pale
ale
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
an
american
ipa
where
are
the
hops
pleasant
floral
smell
i
enjoyed
this
thoroughly
good
white
head
on
top
taste
is
good
bitter
with
light
floweriness
not
much
malt
sweetness
but
malt
presence
is
noticeable
much
more
of
a
britishy
ipa
than
an
american
ipa
this
is
a
great
session
brew
if
youre
into
pale
ale
an
american
ipa
much
more
english
in
character
pours
a
medium
golden
with
an
average
head
that
left
a
little
lacearoma
is
leafy
and
lightly
herbal
with
a
dry
biscuity
malt
hint
taste
is
really
subtle
a
little
minty
and
herbal
with
the
dry
malt
coming
thru
more
as
i
drank
more
iam
not
a
hop
head
but
when
drinking
an
american
ipa
would
like
more
hop
presencenot
horrible
by
any
mean
just
seems
a
little
off
pale
golden
amber
body
and
a
thin
head
the
bubbles
rising
up
from
the
sides
of
the
glass
are
pretty
large
almost
like
soda
bubbles
dried
apricots
and
grassy
hops
make
up
the
bulk
of
the
aroma
more
apricots
and
grassy
hops
are
found
in
the
flavor
wiht
a
bit
of
pepper
i
wasnt
too
happy
to
see
that
this
actually
came
from
otter
creek
good
thing
i
only
bought
a
single
while
they
brew
highquality
beers
i
tend
to
not
enjoy
their
yeast
choices
12
ounce
bottle
bottled
on
122303
batch
1474
it
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
nice
twofinger
sized
head
the
aroma
has
some
peach
and
citrus
with
some
malt
it
is
not
as
hoppy
as
i
expected
for
an
ipa
the
body
is
slightly
malty
with
slight
citrus
and
pine
it
is
hoppy
and
bitter
but
nothing
that
wows
me
a
solid
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
but
it
is
average
and
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
again
conclusion
i
should
trust
my
instincts
more
often
the
next
time
i
stop
by
the
states
this
one
is
a
lock
in
my
grocery
cart
great
stuff
a
solid
american
ipa
i
havent
had
great
experiences
with
organic
beers
but
wolavers
makes
a
credible
brew
with
this
one
tasty
hops
which
linger
in
the
aftertaste
for
hours
yum
i
was
really
excited
about
trying
this
one
for
some
reason
maybe
because
it
is
made
with
all
organic
ingredients
pours
an
orange
coppery
color
with
very
little
head
the
lace
is
there
for
a
while
then
slowly
dissipates
the
taste
is
surprising
at
first
in
that
it
sort
of
hits
your
pallette
with
something
different
bitter
with
an
orange
peel
flavor
very
hoppy
this
is
a
good
beer
and
for
me
it
was
a
different
taste
i
think
over
time
and
a
few
more
bottles
i
will
find
it
to
be
better
than
average
emerges
from
the
bottle
with
a
gently
rocky
white
head
slowly
settling
out
on
clear
and
bright
golden
liquid
nose
is
sweet
malt
and
fresh
hop
flowers
with
a
touch
of
grassiness
the
taste
is
first
sweet
then
a
growing
bitterness
asserts
itself
bitterness
abounds
without
really
dominating
the
palate
just
flowery
with
a
definate
hop
punch
light
fruity
yeast
esters
noted
at
this
point
finshes
bittersweet
and
somewhat
clean
with
an
ultra
slight
alcohol
tinge
at
the
end
yet
superbly
drinkable
more
flavorsome
than
looks
would
lead
you
to
believe
bottled

my
second
wolavers
beer
a
12
oz
bottle
that
pours
a
deep
rusty
beige
coloured
brew
with
a
small
fluffy
white
head
the
aromas
are
of
grains
and
light
hops
the
taste
is
malty
with
some
hops
in
the
middle
and
a
dry
grainy
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
because
this
brew
is
just
too
grainy
the
drinkability
is
ok
but
this
is
more
of
a
decent
pale
ale
than
an
ipa
plus
the
graininess
is
just
a
bit
much
for
my
taste
buds
hazy

with
a
nice
foamy

medium

a
decent

the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
dry
medium
bodied
the
bitterness
rides
the
tongue
softly
for
several
seconds
extremely
drinkable
and
solid
ipa
i
will
look
for
again
poured
a
cloudy
golden
with
a
copper
tinge
without
too
much
head
to
be
seen
smell
was
buttery
and
nutty
with
leafy
floral
hops
and
a
dosage
of
caramel
to
round
out
with
some
sweetness
taste
was
very
crisp
and
hoppy
with
a
good
amount
of
pine
flavors
and
a
more
butterscotch
and
nutty
finish
but
not
overly
so
mouthfeel
was
creamy
as
it
warmed
another
good
offering
from
the
wolaver
line
the
organic
hops
may
be
a
little
light
in
the
shoes
for
an
ipa
its
not
a
hopheads
dream
but
still
a
good
session
beer
startlingly
clear
with
very
little
head
theres
a
strong
maltiness
to
the
aroma
almost
overpowering
the
hopsit
is
a
kind
of
tart
bubblegum
smell
im
intrigued
the
taste
completely
unexpected
there
is
no
sharpness
at
all
instead
there
is
a
muted
bitterness
balanced
with
a
slight
malty
backbonevery
much
like
a
light
eastern
ipa
closer
to
the
english
style
but
without
the
creamy
thickness
a
thin
mouthfeel
this
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
after
such
a
promising
start
im
afraid
the
light
amber
body
supports
a
huge
billowing
head
of
offwhite
creamy
foam
the
good
retention
guarantees
superior
lacing
and
even
when
it
lessens
the
lace
is
outstanding
the
nose
is
surprisingly
more
malty
than
hoppy
giving
fine
caramel
notes
the
flavor
is
lightly
hopped
along
the
english
style
and
with
very
fine
balance
between
the
malt
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
a
very
good
dry
finish
with
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
good
session
brew
for
sure
this
is
a
nice
ipa
true
to
style
and
easy
to
drink
it
doesnt
wow
you
or
leave
you
dissapointed
at
all
just
a
good
drinking
ipa
pours
a
murky
pale
orange
with
minimal
head
good
fruity
citrusy
nose
and
a
decent
though
somewhat
thin
mouthfeel
decent
dry
tangy
residual
aftertatse
classic
ipa
aftertaste
overall
well
balanced
beer
with
decent
drinkability
i
like
the
organic
angle
and
it
is
priced
similar
to
the
other
craft
ipas
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
bottle
conditioned
why
the
heck
not
support
some
organic
farmers
enjoy
it
drinkability

i
liked
this
one
a
little
better
than
my
fellow
bas
i
thought
it
was
well
balanced
refreshing
and
would
make
a
terrific
session
beer
by
the
time
i
near
the
bottom
of
the
pint
im
appreciating
the
mouthfeel
more
first
it
hits
me
with
a
pleasingly
creamy
wave
thats
somewhere
between
woody
and
nutty
this
gradually
gives
way
to
a
tingly
bitter
middle
which
in
turn
eases
into
a
tart
crisp
dry
hoppy
finish
as
a
bonus
it
not
only
changes
during
each
sip
its
taste
evolves
during
the
course
of
a
pint
as
i
drain
this
one
i
gradually
taste
less
creaminess
and
more
woodiness
i
will
be
having
more
of
these
really
nice
rocky
head
and
a
nice
burnt
orange
color
nice
nose
of
fresh
zesty
hops
and
buttery
malt
real
nice
hop
character
that
is
not
over
done
flovors
of
floral
and
leafy
hop
oil
good
malt
balance
and
toasted
buttery
flavors
great
session
ipa
and
would
love
to
taste
this
one
on
tap
mouthfeel
strikes
a
perfect
level
of
carbonation
and
fullness
and
drinkability
is
excellent
good
for
wolavers
if
i
could
get
this
without
driving
to
missouri
it
would
definitely
be
a
common
presence
in
my
fridge
sure
id
buy
a
sixer
of
this
if
given
the
chance
nice
beer
oelergud
after
a
pretty
hard
pour
an
off
white
head
formed
and
stood
for
the
better
part
of
a
minute
the
beer
is
dark
straw
in
color
and
just
a
little
bit
hazy
very
little
carbonation
rising
up
to
the
top
the
malt
aroma
is
kind
of
funky
its
pretty
sweet
smelling
no
hops
grape
juice
it
smells
like
artificial
grape
juice
thats
just
wrong
it
has
a
born
on
date
of
8503
so
i
dont
think
its
too
old
holding
my
nose
the
taste
continues
with
the
malt
trend
a
little
bit
of
caramel
in
there
and
even
less
hops
the
aftertaste
lightly
bitter
with
just
a
touch
of
metal
theres
definitely
something
wrong
with
this
beer
but
even
so
i
dont
see
this
being
all
that
great
a
very
pleasant
beer
this
bottle
wont
be
my
last
clear
light
copper
appearance
thin
white
head
streams
of
co2
bubbles
surface
gradually
pretty
good
blend
of
resinous
hop
character
and
toffee
based
malt
character
very
crisp
in
taste
this
beer
sharp
pine
resin
and
citric
hop
tones
hit
me
first
then
the
bitterness
which
is
quite
noticeable
and
enjoyable
the
malt
foundation
is
toffee
toasted
and
biscuity
theres
actually
a
slight
lingering
sweetness
to
the
aftertaste
if
you
look
hard
enough
body
is
about
medium
and
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
nicely
solid
effort
here
i
am
not
a
hoppy
beer
drinker
but
i
am
willing
to
try
any
style
of
beer
even
if
its
not
a
style
that
i
like
this
beer
had
a
medium
sized
ivory
head
that
mostly
dissipated
with
finemedium
sized
bubbles
the
body
was
clear
with
fine
carbonation
and
an
orangegold
hue
the
nose
was
malt
and
hops
with
a
very
bitter
taste
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
tingly
smooth
dry
textured
and
medium
bodied
this
ipa
was
just
way
too
bitter
tasting
for
me
light
brown
color
small
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
fruity
and
sweet
malty
slightly
sweet
caramelized
full
bodied
but
its
not
very
hoppy
or
bitter
for
an
ipa
mouthfeel
is
full
finish
is
clean
and
very
crisp
aftertaste
is
malty
wild
a
mild
sharp
bitterness
not
my
favorite
ipa
would
not
have
it
again
an
ultra
dense
and
creamy
head
tops
off
this
deeply
golden
and
very
clear
brew
the
aroma
is
one
of
a
newly
mown
lawn
and
a
flower
garden
bitter
grapefruit
spiciness
comes
through
a
soft
and
warm
malt
body
nicely
bittered
from
the
first
sip
until
the
last
a
fine
and
pleasant
drinking
ipa
this
is
one
i
would
definitely
have
again
too
little
time
and
too
many
good
beers
to
try
a
nice
drinkable
ipa
a
nice
one
for
those
late
summer
nights

12
oz
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
bone
white
head
that
settles
for
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
of
pale
malts
and
bitter
hops
there
is
a
bit
of
a
piney
aroma
surrounding
it
along
with
a
hint
of
carapils
malts
the
taste
is
really
good
it
is
hops
all
the
way
the
beer
is
quite
bitter
and
flavorful
there
is
a
strong
hop
content
in
this
one
yeah
hah
the
beer
has
a
med
mouthfeel
and
is
a
sessions
beer
no
doubt
wolavers
otter
creek
make
a
few
good
brews
this
one
stands
out
among
them
underrated
as
far
as
ipas
are
concerned
in
my
opinion
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
white
head
very
well
balanced
one
of
the
more
mild
ipas
but
the
hop
aroma
and
taste
is
still
dominant
this
is
one
very
drinkable
ipa
not
sure
what
makes
it
organic
though
not
as
complex
and
malty
as
the
draft
version
but
still
an
above
average
ipa
german
hops
are
a
unique
twist
i
dont
particularly
care
for
i
liked
it
much
better
on
tap
more
sweetness
and
balance
along
with
fuller
mouth
feel
and
less
carb
bite
on
draught
at
lazy
chameleon
in
powell
oh
dark
orangeamber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
lacing
is
very
light
nice
hoppy
citrus
aroma
i
was
pleased
by
the
flavor
mediumbodied
with
a
nice
mix
of
hops
citrus
and
light
malt
not
as
hoppy
as
most
of
the
better
ipas
out
there
but
not
a
wasted
attempt
either
the
finish
is
bitter
although
it
fades
throughout
the
glass
id
get
it
on
draught
again
this
pours
a
clear
strawberry
blonde
tinged
with
orange
the
head
is
pretty
nice
nd
thick
falling
to
leave
a
complex
lacing
down
the
glass
the
nose
is
very
noticeable
on
this
one
more
like
a
light
fruity
hop
bouquet
of
flowers
the
maltiness
to
the
nose
is
very
strong
and
fruity
the
flavor
on
this
is
a
heavily
contrasting
and
complex
one
on
the
palate
my
first
impression
was
what
is
going
on
then
the
hops
come
along
and
straighten
you
out
there
is
such
a
distinct
contrast
here
between
the
sweet
fruity
malt
and
the
extraordinarily
bitter
hops
that
leaves
you
with
a
pleasantly
distinct
beer
but
sadly
this
is
not
a
great
beer
poured
a
very
lightly
oranged
pale
amber
color
very
odd
hue
to
it
had
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
and
nice
thin
head
though
it
looked
a
little
strange
to
me
like
a
clumpy
sort
of
foam
not
much
lace
its
scent
was
dry
and
earthy
in
a
green
way
as
the
hops
smelt
bairly
floral
more
herbal
the
scent
almost
had
a
malty
sense
to
it
but
was
funked
out
by
the
hops
the
taste
was
bitter
as
usual
but
with
a
hardy
earthy
tone
it
developed
a
light
fruit
taste
though
again
funked
out
pretty
zingy
on
the
tongue
its
long
finish
shortened
as
my
palate
adjusted
to
the
high
ibus
and
particular
funky
bent
of
this
whole
beer
the
drinkability
was
decent
but
in
general
it
was
too
raw
tasting
and
so
needs
better
honing
of
many
parts
of
it
cool
idea
to
go
organic
though
purity
in
beer
is
a
great
thing
this
beer
poured
a
copper
amber
color
and
formed
a
nice
foamy
white
head
that
left
thick
circular
lace
as
it
subsided
some
carbonation
was
present
an
aroma
of
malt
hops
and
a
touch
of
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
malt
hops
and
caramel
the
finish
was
a
touch
bitter
okay
first
off
when
it
comes
to
ipas
i
confess
i
am
a
hop
head
this
beer
had
none
of
the
characteristics
that
one
usually
finds
in
american
ipas
that
being
said
this
beer
didnt
seem
to
even
carry
many
found
is
a
tradional
english
style
i
dont
know
if
this
was
in
its
attempt
to
be
organic
but
for
me
it
fails
for
this
style
pours
perfectly
clear
pale
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
this
is
an
untra
filtered
brew
hops
is
the
first
taste
out
of
the
gate
a
nice
malt
balance
keeps
that
in
check
not
a
hop
heads
ipa
but
certainly
not
without
its
charm
actually
one
of
my
favorite
otter
creek
brews
im
excited
to
see
a
brewery
actually
start
up
an
organic
line
i
try
to
stay
as
organic
as
possible
but
its
just
so
hard
these
days
i
hope
to
see
a
wolavers
stout
someday
i
think
that
there
just
wasnt
any
one
characteristic
that
really
jumped
out
at
me
it
was
a
bit
bland
i
think
there
is
a
place
for
ipas
that
are
not
out
to
overwhelm
you
with
their
hop
profile
but
there
really
wasnt
anything
to
recommend
this
beer
as
one
youd
want
to
have
again
and
again
there
is
a
wonderful
bitter
hop
flavor
that
dominates
this
brew
the
malts
are
there
but
they
are
hidden
a
bit
until
the
grainy
flavors
come
out
just
before
the
aftertaste
after
the
first
few
sips
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
brew
but
after
that
it
just
got
better
citrus
starts
to
come
out
of
hiding
adding
to
the
crispness
provided
by
the
carbonation
the
body
is
pretty
light
but
there
is
not
a
real
lack
of
flavor
i
was
happy
to
say
the
least
with
this
brew
it
is
an
interesting
one
that
is
certainly
worth
trying
pours
a
slightly
hazed
goldenbrown
with
a
small
white
head
that
shrinks
down
to
a
lasting
thin
layer
its
smell
consists
of
light
hops
and
a
burnt
earthy
grain
the
taste
mirrors
the
smell
although
the
hops
are
more
pronounced
it
is
light
bodied
and
finishes
with
a
dry
hop
bitterness
this
beer
is
just
a
little
bit
too
lightly
hopped
for
an
ipa
but
still
pretty
tasty
it
does
however
have
a
strange
twang
that
i
pick
up
in
the
aftertaste
albeit
briefly
aside
from
that
it
is
not
a
bad
brew
and
its
organic
cheers
pours
a
light
to
medium
golden
color
with
a
tall
creamy
white
head
and
has
very
good
retention
the
aroma
is
a
grainy
maltiness
with
notes
of
citrus
and
fresh
baked
bread
it
has
a
breadlike
malty
sweetness
with
a
mildly
bitter
hop
finish
based
on
its
smoothness
youd
never
guess
that
its
6
5
alcohol
well
until
you
drank
several
that
is
cheers

july

purchased
at
whole
foods
in
austin
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
am
used
to
drinking
superhoppy
and
bitter
beers
however
this
beer
had
a
nice
bit
of
hops
but
it
was
very
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
on
top
of
the
hops
i
also
got
subtle
notes
of
citrus
pine
and
grass
would
definitely
want
to
drink
again
im
not
getting
the
hype
on
this
one
light
in
color
smells
funky
like
a
farmhouse
ale
tastes
about
the
same
slightly
bitter
plenty
of
carbonation
if
it
didnt
say
ipa
on
it
i
would
think
i
was
drinking
a
farmhouse

maybe
its
old
was
new

a
respected

tho
o
tasty
goes
down
easily

printed
on

a
little
wary
about
this
one
halfexpecting
a
nuclear
hop
bomb
an
overly
aggressive
pour
produced
about
2

of
fluffy
snowwhite
head
that
lasted
for
quite
some
time
leaving
some
beautiful
sticky
lacing
down
the
glass
as
it
retreated
the
beer
itself
was
a
cloudy
yellowgold
colour
taking
on
more
of
the
golden
hue
when
backlit
jaipurs
aroma
was
dominated
by
grapefruit
with
undertones
of
pine
and
orange
its
flavour
began
with
a
slightly
sweet
juicy
mix
of
grapefruit
orange
and
pine
transitioning
to
a
distinctly
bitter
finish
which
lingered
as
a
longlived
aftertaste
definitely
bitter
but
not
so
bitter
as
to
overwhelm
all
else
and
ruin
the
experience
thornbridge
has
the
balance
just
right
on
this
one
jaipur
had
a
fairly
active
but
suitable
level
of
carbonation
and
i
would
describe
the
beer
as
light
to
medium
bodied
though
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
ipas
generally
this
is
probably
the
nicest
one
that
i
have
tried
to
date
and
i
would
certainly
drink
this
beer
again
at
4
95
per
500
ml
bottle
it
is
pricey
but
quality
and
british
beers
sold
in
canada
generally
usually
are
this
is
a
nice
example
of
a
strong
brit
ipa
much
weaker
than
we
are
used
to
here
in
the
colonies
if
you
can
find
one
a
nice
change
from
our
usual
hop
bombs
smooth
and
easy
drinking
glad
to
have
tried
this
its
expensive
where
i
live
but
its
worth
the
experience
all
around
a
nice
fresh
balanced
ipa
very
well
crafted
beer
very
drinkable
recommended
if
you
find
this
beer
fresh
drink
it
drink
all
of
it
the
floral
hops
in
here
are
out
of
this
world
a
nice
biscuity
malt
backs
it
all
up
very
light
very
delicate
and
very
good
if
this
came
in
reasonablypriced
sixpacks
here
in
the
us
id
drink
it
all
the
time
easily
the
best
ipa
out
of
england
ive
had
so
far
and
actually
rather
unique
o
great
drinkability
excellent
english
ipa
with
an
american
influence
im
slowly
learning
that
good
english
ipa
means
balance
damn
right
this
has
it
all
been
staring
at
this
one
literally
for
years
and
never
pulled
the
trigger
because
it
is
always
1012
for
a
1
pint
9
oz
bottle
sometimes
you
need
to
pay
a
little
to
get
something
good
this
is
worth
the
price
loved
it
ill
call
this
a
delicate
ipa
smoother
less
effervescence
less

punch
really
beautiful
flavors
though
grapefruit

o
while
english

are

this

the

are
definitely
more
apparent

this
beer
has

overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
great
citrus
forward
aromas
and
tasty

that
make
it
very
easy
to
drink
overall
impression
for
a
beer
that
is
ranked
this
highly
on
beeradvocates
top
beers
in
britain
i
honestly
expected
more
it
is
a
little
too
light
in
body
and
malt
character
and
uses
obviously
american
hops
to
be
considered
an
english
ipa
when
compared
to
the
best
ameican
ipas
this
would
not
have
a
prayer
to
make
the
top
50
that
being
said
it
is
quite
refreshing
light
on
the
palate
and
thirst
quenching
well
done
and
pleasant
beer
great
drinkability
od
a
nice
ipa
lovely
interpretation
of
the
american
style
great
hop
profile
light
and
really
drinkable
evokes
a
somewhat
bigger
stone
wood
pacific
ale
o
the
nice
dry
british
hops
character
is
full
with
much
softer
pale
malt
flavors
underneath
the
dry
hop
character
takes
on
an
almost
astringent
quality
but
there
is
enough
depth
in
the
hops
to
counter
that
o
a
good
ipa
but
lacks
a
bit
of
the
malt
flavours
to
balance
this
is
a
pretty
simple
beer
juicy
hops
and
thats
about
it
fresh
its
very
tasty
a
very
refreshing
and
innovative
take
on
the
american
ipa
style
enjoyable
o
good
but
surprised
at
how
highly
others
are
rating
it
it
is
well
balanced
very
versatile
as
its
pretty
middle
of
the
road
in
taste
this
one
is
very
good
loved
it
nice
very
much
like
an
american
style
ipa
which
wasnt
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
this
one
is
a
beer
i
had
heard
a
lot
about
prior
to
drinking
it
and
my
only
regret
is
that
i
put
off
trying
it
for
so
long
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
in
appearance
but
perfect
level
of
carb
in
the
mouth
provides
a
good
explosion
of
flavour
on
the
tongue
smooth
surprisingly
easy
drinking
beer
for
the
abv
odsolid
beer
cant
help
but
feeling
a
bit
of
disappointment
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
most
legit
eipas
out
there
and
i
get
it
on
cask
yet
it
fell
short
a
treat
to
try
and
tastier
than
i
am
willing
to
admit
just
expected
more
and
shame
on
me
for
that
still
one
of
the
better
eipas
i
have
had
all
around
an
excellent
ipa
happy
to
try
this
at
my
place
in
newtown
ct
this
english
ipa
shows
a
clear
pale
amber
color
with
a
fair
white
head
and
very
little
signs
of
lacing
the
aroma
brings
solid
pine
citrus
hop
and
biscuit
malt
hints
not
bad
as
english
styled
ipas
go
the
flavor
brings
very
much
the
same
profile
as
the
aroma
no
surprises
decent
enough
and
probably
a
bit
more
hop
than
many
other
british
hop
brews
i
find
it
to
be
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
for
a
very
solid
liquacious
feel
with
a
little
tinglation
very
nice
ipa
not
highly
memorable
but
plenty
drinkable
and
worth
a
revisit
anytime
in
short
a
well
crafted
ipa
that
remains
smooth
and
nonharsh
despite
all
the
hops
packed
in
500
ml
into

pours
a
nice
foam
that
later
lingers
as

incredible
aroma
mango

easily
identifiable
flavour
follows
the
same
fruity
track
with
bitterness

and
honey
sweetness
at
a
perfect
level
as
a

than

this
is

an

be

is
a
master
of

here
narcisism
looking
for

o

for

day
if
you
like
intense

in
your
ipa
this
is
a
mush
try
overall
a
very
good
beer
not
very
bold
or
spectacular
except
for
the
phenominal
smell
but
certainly
interesting
enough
to
seek
it
out
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
would
love
to
session
o
very
floral
and
fruity
a
style
im
becoming
all
too
familiar
with
but
very
sessionable
non
the
less
still
cant
see
the
fascination
of
this
beer
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
im
underwhelmed
compared
to
most
of
my
mates
overall
a
surprise
package
not
a
stylised
eipa
by
any
means
easy
drinking
for
6
tho
down
0
5
for
price
still
this
is
a
lovely
little
ipa
from
thornbridge
it
has
stacks
of
aromatics
and
a
solid
drinkable
basis
and
that
aroma

like
an

very
well

will
try
again
given
all
of
the

see
suspended

i
went
with
about
as
gentle

i
have
ever

in
just
a

i
wonder
how
much
different
it
is
from
a

finish
was
really
hoppy
and
if
you
had
told
me
that
this
was
an

i
would
not
have

english

until
it
occurs
to
you
that
this
is
actually
a

a

subdued

i
could
drink
this
all
day
any
time
of
the
year
ive
always
maintained
that
a
wellmade
english
ipa
is
a
thing
of
true
beauty
and
this
is
both
of
those
things
overall
thornbridge
jaipur
is
an
exemplary
english
ipa
with
more
intensity
than
traditional
examples
of
the
style
this
flavourful
hoppy
thirstquencher
is
one
of
the
best
uk
beers
that
ive
sampled
a
very
impressive
brew
very
easydrinking
and
approachable
final
grade
4
25
a
high
a
minus
nearly
an
a
jaipur
ipa
seems
to
have
inherited
a
lot
of
traits
from
americanstyle
ipas
but
the
fact
that
the
hop
flavours
are
not
palatescrubbingly
powerful
halfheartedly
corroborates
the
idea
that
this
is
an
english
ipa
but
this
is
all
semantics
its
still
a
ridiculously
tasty
brew
and
there
is
little
doubt
in
my
mind
it
would
be
a
regular
purchase
for
me
if
it
became
a
general
listing
instead
of
just
seasonallyavailable
it
is
well
worth
the
price
and
i
would
eagerly
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
a
delicious
potentially
sessionable
ipa
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
india
pale
ale
style
although
the
beer
tilts
decidedly
toward
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
its
not
without
the
firm
support
of
malt
flavor
and
feel
this
beer
will
surely
delight
the
palate
of
any
fan
of
english
beer
hazy
yellowishorange
surprisingly
almost
no
head
was
formed
no
hiss
or
pop
either
when
i
popped
the
cap
some
clear
bubbles
form
a
head
but
thats
about
it
faint
floral
and
lemon
quality
to
the
nose
touch
of
citrus
zest
more
citrus
lemon
and
grainy
flavours
on
the
palate
definitely
some
english
character
to
the
malt
here
medium
body
but
a
surprisingly
very
low
carbonation
a
good
beer
but
based
on
this
experience
or
bottle
im
not
sure
if
id
grab
another
right
away
o
a
melting
pot
of
old
and
new
this
real
ale
is
kinda
rustic
yet
agressive
and
hop
forward
one
of
the
better
english
ipas
ive
come
across
well
done
cloudy
pale
yellow
body
soapy
white
head
good
retention
very
little
lace
aroma
is
floral
and
lemony
with
softer
evergreen
undertones
lemon
and
biscuits
up
front
followed
by
citrus
pith
and
a
firm
bitterness
that
lasts
well
into
the
aftertaste
lightbodied
with
low
carbonation
i
love
lightbodied
beers
with
solid
flavours
in
the
summertime
and
this
strikes
me
as
a
very
well
made
golden
ale
pretty
moreish
stuff
overall
a
really
complex
bit
of
ipa
lots
of
subtly
which
shows
off
the
strong
distinction
between
big
brash
american
ipas
and
their
often
overlooked
britishenglish
cousins
the
sweet
flower
aroma
and
the
wide
array
of
citrus
flavours
make
this
a
good
example
of
the
skill
and
subtlety
of
english
brewing
english
beers
are
usually
the
most
familiar
but
their
brewers
are
still
evidently
capable
of
surprises
jaipur
is
as
sunny
as
any
beach
in
india
or
san
diego
for
that
matter
it
manages
to
embrace
the
modern
read
american
style
and
level
of
hopping
but
still
drinks
like
a
hearty
rustic
pint
of
real
read
traditional
british
ale
a
really
impressive
offering
this
is
a
great
english
ipa
very
hop
forward
and
an
excellent
showcase
of
english
hops
seek
this
out
bottle
poured
a
hazy
deep
blonde
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
pretty
good
lacing
aroma
of
floral
hops
with
light
dry
notes
with
clean
cereal
notes
is
quite
enjoyable
and
seems
to
be
split
between
an
american
and
british
ipa
taste
is
also
a
great
mix
between
some
floral
and
hoppy
notes
with
a
dry
finish
with
some
clean
cereal
notes
with
some
light
residual
sugar
coming
through
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
love
the
mix
between
citrus
hops
and
floral
dry
british
hops
notes
d
good
drinkability
hops
are
strong
but
have
an
understated
quality
that
lets
the
malt
come
through
decent
worth
and
worth
a
try
but
a
little
too
bitter
to
be
a
fave
a
refreshing
and
drinkable
british
ipa
not
quite
enough
malt
for
my
palette
overall
solid
english
ipa
lots
of
flavor
and
complexity
for
the
style
and
plenty
easy
to
drink
as
well
would
gladly
drink
this
regularly
down
at
the
local
pub
cheers
o
a
tasty
english
ipa
solid
hop
presence
unique
flavours
that
are
sure
to
please
most
critics
some
musty
notes
keeps
it
out
of
the
realm
of
an
american
ipa
well
worth
grabbing
a
bottle
and
i
will
likely
grab
a
few
more
before
they
disappear
at
my
local
lcbo
picked
this
up
at
the
lcbo
had
a
best
before
of
july
sometime
this
year
pours
a
bright
golden
yellow
with
a
good
amount
of
head
tastes
of
grassy
and
lemon
like
notes
has
a
crisp
taste
to
it
but
the
flavour
fades
kinda
quickly
to
an
average
finish
dont
think
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
again
o
quite
good
for
an
english
ipa
the
english
styles
or
ipa
and
barleywine
arent
really
my
cup
of
tea
but
this
really
stands
out
all
in
all
a
lot
more
flavour
than
id
expect
from
anything
classified
as
an
english
ipa
and
a
truly
pleasant
surprise
m
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
still
a
very
good
beer
it
reminded
me
a
pilsner
at
times
there
are
still
shades
of
a
eipa
and
an
american
ipa
as
well
just
the
amount
of
noble
hop
flavour
throws
it
off
a
bit
a
little
pricey
for
me
to
stock
up
on
this
one
but
well
worth
a
try
o
an
excellent
ipa
with
some
amercian
ipa
characteristics
definitely
buy
it
when
you
see
it
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
one
of
the
better
ipas
ive
ever
had
d
very
good
english
ipa
that
is
very
well
balanced
and
easytodrink
quite
impressed
overall
very
nice
perhaps
not
the
most
traditional
english
ipa
but
a
very
nice
beer
an
enjoyable
brew
but
those
looking
for
a
hoppy
blast
will
do
well
to
limit
their
search
to
this
side
of
the
pond
overall
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
this
but
its
certainly
sessionable
and
well
crafted
i
would
love
to
try
the
cask
version
or
a
fresher
bottle
superb
the
palate
has
a
very
nice
herbal
hop
bitterness
with
a
deliciously
snappy
mineral
character
making
this
very
refreshing
crackerlike
malts
make
this
drying
and
refreshing
the
midpalate
has
hop
resins
and
mineral
incorporated
in
a
way
that
each
character
enhances
the
other
drying
with
a
bitter
finish
with
nice
resins
the
hop
character
is
decidedly
american
with
a
little
bit
of
an
english
leafy
and
earthy
character
light
in
body
with
crisp
carbonation
this
beer
is
excellent
highly
recommended
ill
have
to
revisit
it
when
i
find
fresher
samples
o
a
solid
ipa
for
those
who
want
drinkability
over
flavor
a
bit
lackluster
for
my
taste
i
enjoyed
it
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
o
really
enjoy
the
english
ipa
as
a
different
type
of
ipa
than
the
ones
i
have
been
drinking
a
lot
of
recently
west
coast
and
dipas
the
lower
abv
and
slightly
lighter
hop
bitterness
is
a
nice
change
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
lower
abv
definitely
makes
this
one
sessionable
a
good
hoppy
english
ipa
well
done
picked
this
up
at
my
favorite
beer
store
in
belgium
dranken
geers
nearly
clear
yellow
pour
with
just
a
touch
of
orange
nice
two
finger

with
good
retention
and
lacing
wonderful
citrusy
floral
nose
with
hints
of
lemon
orange
zest
tangerines
and
grapefruit
with
just
a
touch
of
ginger
the
taste
mirrors
the
smell
and
is
dominated
by
the
huge
citrus
profile
mouthwatering
juicy
notes
of
tangerine
lemon
and
grapefruit
with
a
hint
of
mango
and
pine
a
solid
sweet
caramel
malt
base
balances
out
the
resiny
fresh
hop
bitterness
perfectly
the
mouthfeel
is
awesome
as
well
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
a
touch
of
oily
hoppiness
and
a
really
refreshing
and
crisp
dry
bitter
finish
once
again
thornbridge
has
managed
to
come
up
with
a
spot
on
style
interpretation
that
is
totally
drinkable
they
have
quickly
become
my
favorite
brewery
they
just
dont
make
a
bad
beer
one
of
the
best
ipas
ive
ever
tasted
overall
great
beer
got
to
be
my
favorite
britishstyle
ipa
try
one
on
tap
at
local
option
in
chicago
served
in
a
tulip
slightly
hazy
straw
color
thick
white

overpowering
medium

with
a
light

a
nice
easy
drinker
recommended
overalldrinkability
i
really
enjoyed
the
smell
and
taste
on
this
one
but
for
the
price
i
cannot
see
myself
getting
it
again
still
with
all
that
hop
aroma
and
flavor
i
suspect
this
beer
would
be
quite
something
fresh
out
of
a
cask
so
if
that
option
was
available
i
would
pay
for
a
glass
again
the
only
drawback
in
my
opinion
is
that
as
it
warms
up
to
something
more
of
an
english
temperature
it
gets
more
and
more
bitter
almost
but
not
quite
mouthpuckering
bitter
overall
an
interesting
take
on
the
english
ipa
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
as
for
drinkability
one
glass
albeit
a
large
one
is
enough
o
a
nicely
balanced
and
easily
drinkable
ipa
felt
a
bit
heavy
on
my
stomach
for
a
couple
for
hours
but
maybe
it
was
just
me
love
it
o
this
is
a
wonderfully
flavorful
gorgeously
balanced
ipa
that
straddles
the
line
between
english
and
american
variants
of
the
style
very
much
worth
trying
damn
good
taste
not
hta
bitterness
you
get
sometimes
thanks
for
this
treat
craig
2013
update
i
found
a
bottle
in
a
local
beer
store
in
louisville
and
it
was
not
good
i
dont
know
if
it
was
ruined
by
light
or
time
but
the
beer
sadly
tasted
nothing
like
what
i
had
in
the
uk
and
it
was
quite
pricey
to
boot
something
like
7
for
the
bottle
i
purchased
overall
drinkability
enjoyable
decently
complex
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
bitter
or
was
trying
to
pair
this
with
a
meal
i
might
enjoy
it
substantially
more
because
it
has
good
balance
and
presentation
of
characters
unfortunately
its
not
so
great
at
being
a
standalone
beer
on
this
ocassion
still
worth
checking
out
no
off
characters
very
nice
ipa
in
the
british
rather
than
us
style
nicely
balanced
with
solid
hop
profile
never
quite
taking
over
would
recommend
it
the
main
trouble
with
english
beers
coming
over
to
bc
is
even
when
they
just
arrive
in
stores
thye
often
dont
taste
fresh
which
is
a
problem
for
a
beer
which
relies
on
floral
hops
notes
and
a
subtle
citrus
note
i
liked
the
beer
but
could
detect
age
in
the
flavour
and
a
drop
in
the
level
of
the
hops
used
it
ended
tasting
a
lot
like
the
brockton
ipa
from
granville
island
when
i
know
fresh
it
probably
more
sublime
not
worth
the
7
a
bottle
when
i
can
get
fresh
brockton
in
cans
for
12
a
six
85
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
i
got
a
bottle
of
this
at
the
beer
store
in
southampton
pa
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
without
so
much
as
a
hint
of
a
head
perhaps
would
have
been
otherwise
with
a
straight
down
the
center
pour
very
interesting
nose
i
cant
quite
place
it
mild
pine
and
citrus
malt
thats
it
malt
the
taste
confirms
it
the
taste
definitely
reveals
some
hops
but
its
still
a
very
malt
forward
beer
which
is
different
for
an
ipa
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
with
a
bit
of
a
sharp
bitter
bite
at
the
tale
end
near
the
tip
and
the
sides
of
your
tongue
overall
this
is
very
good
beer
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
wouldnt
hesitate
to
order
a
pint
of
this
going
forward
cheers
o
tasty
and
crisp
a
nice
hop
profile
with
malts
like
a
pa
to
me
wow
an
eipa
that
isnt
afraid
of
the
almighty
hop
and
what
it
can
do
for
you
to
crib
from
a
famous
american
trope
a
lovely
dry
and
fruity
india
pale
ale
by
anyones
scale
a
fine
beer
particularly
on
cask
i
had
this
on
handpump
at
the
brick
store
pub
a
very
nice
pour
with
excellent
clarity
and
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
about
34
of
an
inch
tall
lovely
leafy
hop
aromas
leap
from
the
glass
nice
herbal
notes
with
a
hint
of
mint
peeking
through
the
taste
is
also
quite
nice
with
more
leafy
herbalness
an
earthy
bitterness
and
a
lovely
creaminess
soft
bitter
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
beer
i
tend
to
get
a
glass
of
every
time
i
see
it
on
definitely
moreish
english
ipa
in
the
sense
that
its
made
with
an
american
temperament
and
english
hops
must
say
that
it
quite
a
wonderful
beer
but
ever
beer
ive
had
from
them
has
been
great
hop
richness
and
an
abv
of
a
apa
pour
is
yellow
golden
almost
clear
with
a
nice
sticky
head
nose
grassiness
the
beer
itself
had
a
wonderful
feel
of
intense
grassy
lemon
zest
very
dry
and
quick
finish
like
bit
of
sweetness
in
there
no
mineral
nots
a
bit
chalk
dry

enjoy
it

use

support
but
overall
an
extremely
drinkable
beverage
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
not
something
id
frequently
go
out
of
my
way
for
good
natural
carbonation
even
at
5
9
a
decently
sessionable
ipa
very
dry
ipa
which
is
an
awesome

to
go

the

even

this

is
excellent

o
very
drinkable
not
what
you
necessarily
expect
from
an
ipa
little
high
for
a
session
beer
at

but
this
is
very
good
10
for
a
1
pint
0
9
fl
oz
bottle
at
brasserie
v
d
not
the
most
overly
complex
ipa
but
nicely
balanced
and
an
impressive
mouthfeel
overall
surprisingly
delicious
interesting
enough
but
not
overpowering
potentially
making
it
a
good
session
beer
having
recently
been
to
jaipur
india
it
is
apt
one
of
the
cleaner
indian
cities
this
beer
is
not
massive
like
other
ipas
but
interesting
enough
to
raise
eyebrows
can
only
assume
the
skunky
taste
other
reviewers
found
was
due
to
a
bad
batch
a
very
good
ipa
ive
been
a
little
weary
of
english
ipas
of
late
having
developed
a
taste
for
the
massive
american
ipas
but
this
is
a
great
example
of
what
england
can
do
its
got
a
good
alcohol
strength
a
pleasant
taste
with
a
good
hop
profile
this
is
definitely
a
great
savouring
beer
but
would
also
work
well
in
session
quantity
quite
the
easydrinker
for
the
style
it
holds
its
own
and
delivers
a
hop
kick
that
is
more
than
simply
onedimensional
malt
presence
is
pretty
absent
this
one
is
all
about
the
hops
cheers
my
only
regret
is
that
not
more
people
got
to
try
it
fresh
from
the
cask
i
suppose
after
all
that
us
americans
prefer
a
bit
more
oomph
in
our
ales
however
i
can
hardly
imagine
even
the
most
bombastic
of
palettes
turning
down
a
second
pint
moreish
indeed
i
took
a
shot
in
the
dark
buying
this
one
but
im
so
stoked
i
did
worth
looking
for
if
you
can
appreciate
something
other
then
a
big
alpha
acid
enamel
stripper
the
brits
dont
getor
need
to
with
gems
like
this
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
on
it
the
lacing
it
very
light
but
does
show
around
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
lightly
citrusy
with
a
good
amount
of
malts
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
a
little
on
the
weak
side
i
do
like
the
flavor
flavors
it
does
have
though
mouthfeel
was
pretty
thin
actually
the
carbonation
was
limited
but
had
enough
to
kelp
it
interesting
overall
its
a
pretty
nice
regular
ipa
wellbalanced
beer
very
drinkable
this
version
on
tap
just
wasnt
a
pretty
beer
maybe
ill
try
a
bottle
next
time
i
like
a
good
dry
beer
so
this
is
right
up
my
alley
i
would
have
this
again
but
i
can
see
how
it
would
not
be
for
everyone
overall
i
love
english
ipas
but
theyre
difficult
to
find
here
in
the
states
glad
to
see
jaipur
on
the
shelf
fantastic
beer
poured
clear
light
gold
with
a
bit
of
a
white
head
floral
aroma
with
a
floral
taste
accompanied
by
very
light
citrus
hopiness
and
a
bit
of
breadiness
extremely
mild
and
smooth
for
an
ipa
light
crisp
mouthfeel
and
easy
drinkability
very
easygoing
for
an
ipa
and
surprisingly
light
on
the
hops
i
prefer
my
ipas
hoppy
but
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
md
smoothly
carbonated
and
mediumplus
bodied
ipa
for
the
5
9
alc
content
this
bottleconditioned
version
well
at
least
its
unfiltered
and
unpasteurised
according
to
the
back
label
is
no
less
good
than
the
draughtcask
version
as
far
as
im
concerned
if
one
is
after
a
wellbalanced
english
ipa
i
think
this
is
a
perfect
choice
due
to
its
high
level
of
drinkability
and
marvellous
balance
pleasantly
felt
on
both
the
nose
and
the
palate
i
love
real
ales
on
cask
but
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
english
ipas
this
beer
was
a
perfect
example
of
both
i
highly
recommend
that
you
seek
this
beer
out
on
cask
if
you
have
the
chance
clean
crisp
refreshing
great
balance
of
earthy
flinty
biscuty
malts
to
the
earthy
floral
citrusy
hops
still
some
berry
like
notes
on
the
finish
nice
and
dry
not
overly
bitter
from
hops
but
a
food
that
could
pair
well
with
many
of
dishes
flavour
flavour
presents
a
little
malt
sweetness
with
loads
of
earthy
spicy
hops
and
an
intense
but
not
overbearing
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
acceptable
the
beer
is
a
bit
chewy
and
grainy
in
my
mouth
but
the
medium
body
is
bolstered
by
a
decent
carbonation
the
overall
score
is
between
average
and
good
if
you
love
english
ipas
this
is
your
beer
not
my
thing
but
a
good
example
of
the
style
overall
hv
great
out
of
the
cask
and
solid
nothing
fancy
challenging
or
complex
just
flat
out
good
and
very
drinkable
serving
type
bottle
o
very
pleasant
overall
either
on
its
own
or
as
a
session
drink
no
off
flavours
here
along
with
a
light
body
and
lower
abv
this
stuff
ends
up
going
down
pretty
easily
this
seems
to
be
one
of
the
more
highlyrated
english
ipas
out
there
i
guess
when
it
comes
down
to
it
englishstyle
ipa
is
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
cheers
im
proud
to
have
been
a
jaipur
drinker
since
2005
long
may
that
continue
id
place
this
beer
below
meantimes
for
my
favourite
in
the
category
but
it
only
loses
out
by
a
whisker
light
and
crisp
yet
a
nice
round
biscuity
malt
body
crisp
grassy
hops
with
a
dry
bitter
hop
bite
loads
of
hops
hint
of
metallic
bite
honey
wet
grass
hefty
hops
and
body
for
an
english
ipa
almost
what
a
english
dipa
would
taste
like
really
drinkable
this
would
be
superb
on
cask
only
5
9
needed
to
make
what
must
be
one
of
the
finest
beers
in
all
the
world
take
note
craft
brewers
everywhere
who
can
only
get
good
flavour
by
making
their
beers
as
strong
as
wine
i
have
great
respect
for
this
brewery
and
this
brew
again
confirms
it
yes
english
understated
and
smooth
drinking
craftmanship
yet
delivers
an
ibu
bitterness
that
wakes
up
the
taste
buds
enjoyable
drinkability
though
more
of
a
sipper
to
save
the
buds
from
being
shredded
like
an
imperial
english
ipa
bottle
from
premiere
gourmet
a
second
tasting
of
the
beer
was
even
better
in
terms
of
the
smellno
skunk
the
malt
was
much
more
present
in
this
tastingsoft
and
balanced
im
no
foodie
but
you
cannot
go
wrong
with
jaipur
check
it
out
m
very
low
carbination
very
easy
to
drink
would
nearly
go
as
far
to
call
it
a
session
beer
if
it
wasnt
for
its
abv
d
this
is
a
nice
british
ipa
the
musty
hop
character
works
nicely
with
the
dry
toasty
malt
there
is
nothing
complex
going
on
here
but
the
beer
is
sessionable
despite
its
alcoholic
strength
d
this
has
good
drinkability
somewhat
expensive
but
worth
a
try
a
very
interesting
and
delicious
ipa
from
the
folks
at
thornbridge
and
definitely
worthy
of
a
try
a
good
beer
a
citrus
dominated
india
pale
ale
but
i
would
call
it
an
esb
if
i
didnt
know
better
very
well
balanced
but
packed
with
flavors
impressively
so
considering
its
modest
abv
highly
recommend
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
hoppy
with
citrus
grass
carrots
and
caramel
malt
the
appearance
is
hazy
amber
with
a
huge
head
for
an
ipa
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
a
touch
of
vegetables
and
astringent
chemicals
not
a
good
way
to
finish
but
thankfully
the
bad
stuff
was
the
weakest
part
the
palate
is
thick
for
an
ipa
the
beer
is
drinkable
overall
but
not
a
great
beer
warm
with
low
carbonation
medium
body
with
a
lightly
syrupy
texture
with
a
light
bitter
finish
overall
i
enjoyed
this
nice
english
ipa
from
a
cask
even
if
it
wasnt
a
proper
cask
a
solid
and
well
done
beer
thats
worth
a
shot
d
very
drinkable
d
this
is
a
really
good
english
ipa
it
is
nice
to
take
a
break
from
the
american
hop
bombs
with
this
lighter
very
crisp
ipa
that
is
full
of
lemony
and
citrus
hop
goodness
poured
a
goldish
orange
with
minimal
head
on
top
of
a
light
blend
of
herbal
tealike
hops
and
some
caramel
malt
very
light
and
pleasant
little
bland
but
a
good
citric
herbal
hop
like
presence
that
is
subdued
and
a
decent
sweet
malt
base
that
complements
the
dominant
hops
finishes
crisp
thanks
to
carbonation
and
minor
hop
bitterness
and
the
abv
is
wellhidden
for
such
a
light
tasting
beer
that
is
made
to
enjoy
on
a
warm
summer
day
bottleconditioned
50cl
bottle
from
the
beer
emporium
sandbach
poured
into
an
oversize
moors
glass
pours
a
hazy
orange
colour
good
white
head
stayed
on
the
glass
the
whole
drink
intense
hop
aroma
dominates
with
resinous
pine
i
really
like
this
beer
the
hop
sensation
hits
straight
away
the
citrus
flavours
of
orangegrapefruit
being
prominent
mouthfeel
is
comfortable
without
a
lot
of
carbonation
this
is
a
beer
for
the
hopheads
very
drinkable
i
found
the
bottleconditioned
version
more
to
my
liking
than
the
filtered
version
having
more
indepth
flavour
and
a
more
satisfying
body
feel
im
sure
that
this
ipa
has
a
more
usa
feel
than
most
english
indias
d
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
rather
refreshing
the
low
alcohol
content
makes
this
quite
sessionable
d
a
well
done
drinkable
beer
f
it
finishes
somewhat
bitter
with
almost
a
touch
of
astringency
the
grassy
floral
hop
character
really
builds
to
a
nice
finish
touch
of
malts
it
is
mostly
dry
too
the
freshness
of
this
really
shows
and
makes
the
beer
much
more
tasty
d
excellent
flavoursome
ipa
with
excellent
balance
and
hop
refreshment
a
very
drinkable
proper
strength
thank
god
british
ipa
perfectly
drinkable

a

brew
very
good
drinkability
a
good
eipa
from
the
source
so
to
speak
with
just
a
bit
of
american
influence
imo
would
to
get
a
hold
of
this
on
cask
or
even
just
a
7
day
old
bottle
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
even
though
it
is
hop
forward
im
so
glad
i
tried
it
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
refreshing
for
the
style
with
minimal
unpleasant
coating
and
aftertaste
slightly
hazed
golden
brass
with
a
bubbly
offwhite
head
that
reminds
me
of
a
colorblindness
test
lots
of
hay
orange
lemon
and
arugula
right
out
of
the
gate
plus
a
faint
waft
of
floral
honeysuckle
malts
stay
wellhidden
behind
the
veil
of
hops
but
you
know
theyre
back
there
the
taste
is
deliciously
inappropriately
hoppy
bitter
orange
and
marjoram
and
a
bit
of
leafiness
are
wellcountered
by
malts
with
a
mild
but
distinctively
fruity
sweetness
pineapple
comes
to
mind
the
finish
is
lingeringly
bitter
and
lipsmackingly
though
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
full
and
slick
this
one
is
difficult
to
put
down
i
wish
more
uk
brewers
would
use
hops
in
such
a
bold
and
skillful
way
drinkability
is
fantastic
never
wears
on
the
palate
overall
an
excellent
ipa
definitely
the
best
british
example
ive
tried
recommended
this
is
a
terrific
ipa
light
in
color
full
of
flavor
aromatic
and
satisfying
the
beer
is
a
completely
transparent
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
beautiful
lace
and
nice
density
with
relatively
good
stayingpower
the
aroma
is
great
for
an
english
ipa
it
has
a
lot
of
fresh
hop
aroma
dry
hopped
its
very
floral
and
theres
even
a
little
citrus
although
the
smell
is
a
sweet
notoverpowering
citrus
great
taste
as
well
lots
of
pale
malt
slightly
bread
and
biscuit
with
an
undercurrent
of
fruit
apricot
hops
are
present
as
well
but
are
balancing
on
the
tongue
not
nearly
bitter
moderate
mouthfeel
the
brew
has
some
heft
but
is
light
enough
to
not
be
filling
makes
you
want
another
this
is
a
very
appealing
and
rewarding
english
ipa
super
drinkable
and
a
fine
session
beer
i
would
really
like
to
try
this
out
of
a
firkin
it
seems
that
others
thought
much
more
of
it
out
of
that
container
this
beer
was
a
yellowish
blond
with
a
very
farmhouse
appearance
a
nice
white
head
formed
on
top
owen
says
this
cask
used
some
american
hops
cascade
and
you
could
smell
it
in
the
citrusy
hop
aroma
the
taste
was
rather
impressive
for
a
cask
as
it
held
its
carbonation
and
hop
presence
quite
well
although
not
my
favorite
beer
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
cask
offering
unlike
most
british
ipas
this
had
a
crisp
citrusy
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
creamy
with
little
weight
this
was
the
last
beer
we
tasted
so
my
perceptions
may
have
been
a
bit
off
by
that
point
this
beer
had
a
very
nice
hop
aroma
it
was
a
nice
dry
ipa
and
very
hoppy
i
could
sit
down
and
drink
several
of
these
without
problem
very
enjoyable
caskconditioned
and
served
via
handpump
at
pizzeria
paradiso
in
washington
dc
the
jaipur
ipa
was
delivered
to
me
with
a
short
head
of
white
foam
resting
atop
a
mainly
clear
golden
body
the
head
held
well
and
it
left
short
walls
and
sheets
of
lace
as
it
went
the
aroma
offered
notes
of
tart
apple
marmalade
and
grassy
and
spicy
hops
all
of
which
carried
over
into
the
flavor
along
with
some
added
biscuitlike
mildly
sweet
malt
it
was
hoppy
but
not
overdone
and
wellrounded
a
solid
but
again
not
overlydone
bitterness
anchored
it
leading
to
a
long
grassy
and
spicy
bitter
finish
the
moderate
carbonation
and
smoothness
helped
with
that
and
it
was
remarkably
easy
to
drink
light
bright
golden
straw
color
with
a
compactyet
soft
white
head
that
stays
small
but
leaves
good
lace
nose
of
earthy
herbal
tea
with
lemon
flavors
of
earthy
hop
bitterness
uk
style
but
in
enough
quantity
for
an
openminded
us
hophead
to
appreciate
light
dry
cracker
malt
taste
in
the
middle
with
a
light
to
medium
silky
mouthfeel
and
mild
bitter
finish
i
drank
it
with
some
mild
flavored
fish
tilapia
with
just
a
little
salt
pepper
rosemary
in
a
small
amount
of
blended
olive
oil
and
butter
good
stuff
drinkability
almost
the
definition
of
a
session
beer
a
fantastic
way
to
end
the
festival
the
appearance
is
a
nice
golden
straw
color
with
a
frothy
bubbly
head
ala
cask
conditioning
thank
you
very
much
and
good
carbonation
the
aroma
here
is
somewhat
subdued
perhaps
by
the
cask
although
i
dont
think
so
but
still
maintains
a
pleasant
sense
very
piney
and
a
bit
grassy
but
strong
too
and
almost
a
slight
marijuana
smell
seriously
im
not
making
this
up
the
taste
is
fabulous
rubbery
in
a
good
way
with
lots
of
spicy
hops
this
beer
very
much
reminds
me
of
the
victory
hop
wallop
i
mean
they
could
be
identical
twins
practically
mouthfeel
is
full
and
chewy
very
solid
id
take
this
cask
version
of
the
jaipur
ipa
over
mosts
standard
ipas
anyday
of
the
week
but
i
also
really
really
like
spicy
hoppy
ipas
a
worthy
component
for
any
hopheads
repertoire
for
sure
drink
up
this
is
one
of
the
best
uk
cask
beers
i
have
ever
sampled
anywhere
i
will
definitely
look
for
it
on
my
next
trip
to
britain
and
will
certainly
order
it
any
time
i
find
it
available
in
the
us
i
rank
it
on
par
with
hop
back
summer
lightning
an
excellent
pint
out
of
the
cask
this
beer
pours
a
very
attractive
cloudy
yellowgold
color
with
excellent
head
retention
and
decent
lacing
there
is
not
a
lot
in
the
nose
maybe
some
wet
earth
and
leafiness
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
most
impressive
nice
citrus
from
the
hops
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
interspersed
with
the
sweet
malt
this
beer
is
very
light
and
refreshing
to
drink
in
comparison
to
most
of
the
ipas
and
dipas
you
find
in
the
states
with
excellent
mouthfeel
and
crispness
i
guess
in
england
this
would
be
considered
too
high
in
alcohol
for
a
true
session
beer
but
i
could
easily
see
myself
tossing
back
3
or
4
of
these
on
a
warm
afternoon
very
impressive
like
nothing
you
are
likely
to
find

s

uk
082013
on
nitro
tap
let
me
start
by
saying
that
im
not
a
hops
fan
but
this
is
beer
reinforce
that
this
is
the
first
time
ive
ever
truly
regret
not
having
had
a
taste
first
ive
spent
the
money
will
drink
it
down
as
not
to
fret
the
bar
but
this
should
have
a
warning
label
imo
this
is
way
off
base
i
see
the
rate
beer
give
it
an
88
rating
a
jaundiced
view
no
doubt
overall
the
most
enjoyable
thing
about
this
beer
was
its
flavoring
especially
after
it
came
to
temperature
it
was
a
tough
call
to
choose
actually
because
we
were
rather
dissatisfied
all
around
with
regards
to
the
lacking
of
hops
in
both
the
nose
and
flavoring
the
aroma
starts
with
soft
sweets
and
decently
robust
floral
herbal
qualities
but
without
the
hops
it
doesnt
sit
too
well
stylistically
we
ran
into
the
exact
same
thing
with
the
flavoring
we
havent
had
a
straight
english
ipa
in
awhile
and
we
were
pretty
excited
so
maybe
we
were
let
down
a
little
too
hard
additionally
and
this
may
be
due
to
the
nitro
but
things
seemed
way
too
flat
and
overly
soft
to
support
the
base
flavor
which
remained
somewhat
complex
inherently
while
this
isnt
a
terrible
beer
as
it
does
hit
the
spot
it
fell
way
short
of
what
we
were
expecting
again
especially
after
that
aroma
this
beer
is
pretty
good
all
things
considered
its
a
tough
style
to
brew
a
beer
to
win
over
a
crowd
with
but
i
can
happily
enjoy
this
22ounce
pour
with
no
regrets
alcohol
wont
get
you
either
maybe
its
hitormiss
but
ondraft
its
a
hit
overall
a
rather
tasty
and
smooth
tasting
brew
with
a
very
nice
but
still
quite
drinkable
level
of
hop
overall
it
is
a
rather
balanced
brew
and
a
treat
to
drink
i
was
a
little
surprised
that
i
liked
this
one
since
it
is
a
fairly
common
and
inexpensive
beer
it
poured
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
slight
white
head
a
nice
malty
aroma
topped
this
one
off
no
real
hint
of
the
hops
was
detectable
in
the
aroma
in
the
initial
taste
one
gets
peach
skin
notes
mingling
with
the
hops
a
smooth
malty
backbone
makes
this
a
nice
easy
drinker
the
hops
are
not
too
abrasive
in
this
ipa
but
are
well
balanced
with
the
fruit
and
malts
in
the
aftertaste
the
malt
smooths
the
peach
skin
into
a
more
modest
fruit
flavor
a
surprisingly
potent
6
8
abv
allows
a
mild
warming
sensation
to
be
part
of
the
aftertaste
the
carbonation
was
not
overly
aggressive
making
the
aftertaste
linger
this
would
be
a
nice
ipa
to
have
with
a
meal
since
it
is
not
too
complex
the
food
would
not
cause
you
to
miss
certain
nuances
of
the
beer
o
pretty
solid
i
would
get
it
again
depending
on
the
price
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
was
an
english
ipa
when
as
i
noted
for
the
nose
but
the
flavor
is
more
subdued
as
would
be
expected
for
an
eipa
a
decent
beer
certainly
better
on
nitro
than
from
the
bottle
but
still
a
fairly
average
beer
theres
nothing
wrong
with
the
feel
its
moderately
both
crisp
and
smooth
with
active
but
stable
carbonation
in
a
solid
medium
body
a
solidlyconstructed
english
ipa
overall
this
beer
may
turn
out
to
be
a
downthedrainer
while
i
return
to
the
fridge
for
a
hop
fix
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
is
not
true
to
style
and
a
huge
barely
drinkable
disappointment
perhaps
the
sixpack
i
bought
was
a
bad
batch
or
was
somehow
mistreated
o
having
only
recently
being
introduced
to
boulder
i
must
say
that
so
far
i
am
very
impressed
by
their
beers
all
of
them
are
very
flavorful
and
full
and
are
perfect
examples
of
their
respective
styles
this
beer
is
no
different
and
is
a
great
example
of
a
british
style
ale

let

we
will
as
we
have

that
this
may
be
the
last
brewing
of
this
amazing
beer
cheers
o
this
beer
is
my
personal
fav
from
boulder
beer
i
wish
they
would
make
this
year
round
this
is
a
fine
beverage
and
one
i
would
have
again
the
feel
is
a
bit
aggressive
for
something
i
would
consider
sessionable
however
the
beer
overall
is
one
i
would
recommend
to
a
friend
o
wow
didnt
expect
to
like
this
beer
as
much
as
i
do
i
would
almost
say
it
tastes

to
me
not
sure
exactly
what
they

you
like

like

of

beers
that

to
keep
you
interested

the
soft

you
expect

peels
in
the
taste

malty

the
scent
is
not

strong

what
there
is
is
light
floral
taste
is
a
nice
floral
taste

a

bitterness
that
lingers

feel

thick

not

somthing
a

more
on
the
bitter
side
drinkability
quite
pleasant
to
drink
the
bitterness
is
strong
at
first
taste
but
doesnt
linger
or
leave
an
overly
dry
taste
will
buy
again
overall
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
regular

with
some

there
is

not
so
much
that
it
overwhelms
the
flavor
probably
the
best
offering
ive
had
from
boulder
beer
decent
beer
that
can
get
easly
lost
in
the
plethora
of
ipas
out
there
worth
trying
but
stick
with
your
favorite
fairly
pale
in
color
more
golden
straw
with
shades
of
amber
a
thick
white
cap
atop
it
that
has
very
good
retention
and
leaves
some
rings
of
lacing
down
the
glass
kind
of
fruity
pebbles
smelling
and
floral
earthy
hops
and
a
hint
of
biscuity
bread
but
artificial
flavor
or
something
pineapple
and
weird
grapefruit
but
out
of
place
very
sugary
malt
same
thing
with
the
flavor
i
think
the
hop
profile
is
good
but
the
malt
kills
it
giving
it
no
chance
to
come
to
the
forefront
mouthfeel
is
solid
creamy
and
smooth
at
first
with
a
bitterness
that
soon
meets
it
and
rides
out
to
a
moderately
dry
finish
something
about
this
one
just
doesnt
work
for
me
ill
probably
try
it
again
down
the
road
but
notes
textbookbut
very
appealing
in
that
this
went
down
well
and
could
almost
be
a
session
beer
da
quite
drinkable
brew
enough
hops
to
keep
me
on
my
toes
and
a
firm
malt
foundation
thats
able
to
pull
everything
together
drinkability
could
have
done
without
the
sourness
but
overall
a
pretty
good
job
that
could
have
been
great

another
great
beer
from

nice
beer
overall
a
very
solid
and
very
underated
ipa
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
on
tap
it
was
as
solid
an
ipa
as
i
have
had
recently
and
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
d
nicely
done
very
drinkable
d
i
guess
it
hangs
onto
english
brew
style
large
and
in
charge
and
not
as
much
hops
as
an
american
apa
not
bad
but
not
great
about
a
one
finger
frothy
head
that
wallows
away
to
a
nice
beneath
the
foam
there
is
a
copper
amber
with
highlights
of
gold
and
symetrical
bubbling
theres
also
some
nice
brussels
lace
as
well
the
aroma
is
an
oily
hop
and
medium
toasted
caramel
and
crystal
malt
bread
when
i
mean
oily
i
mean
oil
the
taste
is

somewhat
fruity

toasted
biscuit

think

bitter
toasted
egg
bagel
oily
palte
that
feels

better

the

this
beer
has
sessionable
written
all
over
it
minus
the
oily
smell
and
stale
malt
overall
a
very
nice
bitter
notes
from
120807
drinkable
yet
not
overly
desireable
lacking
in
appearance
and
mouthfeel
but
the
palate
is
full
of
that
nice
notoverthetop
british
character
that
makes
for
a
quenching
and
sessionable
brew
a
real
interesting
tasty
beer
that
will
allows
have
a
place
in
my
refrigerator
d
while
this
beer
had
its
strong
points
the
taste
was
just
not
to
my
liking
very
offputting
pretty
thin
on
the
body
with
good
carbonation
not
bad
i
guess
i
prefer
the
american
version
to
the
british
but
this
wasnt
bad
at
all
probably
wont
purchase
this
again
a
decent
eipa
i
dont
try
many
of
these
maybe
because
i
am
american
i
like
my
beers
crisp
and
biting
this
beer
has
a
nice
pour
light
gold
with
a
few
small
bubbles
and
a
one
finger
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
weird
mix
of
hops
and
farts
yes
i
said
farts
two
years
running
and
it
still
has
this
same
element
taste
was
light
malt
and
a
hint
of
caramel
with
a
very
light
european
variety
hop
aftertaste
d
citrus
grapefruit
flavor
makes
this
taste
to
me
like
more
of
an
american
than
english
ipa
its
a
decent
beer
overall
however
id
happily
drink
this
again
drinkability
not
my
session
beer
of
choice
but
i
could
see
making
an
decent
evening
out
of
this
one
if
i
had
to
overall
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
definitely
quite
sessionable
the
strong
points
are
the
flavorful
malts
and
the
quintessential
english
ale
aromas
the
low
points
are
the
slight
lack
of
hops
and
the
overcarbonation
i
would
love
to
find
this
beer
on
cask
somewhere
in
the
meantime
i
will
definitely
be
buying
more
of
this
it
may
be
one
of
the
more
complex
easy
drinking
beers
ive
had
in
recent
times
i
am
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
2
fingers
of
frothy
offwhite
head
very
good
retention
and
nice
spotty
stick
smells
of
grapefruit
floral
and
earthy
hops
bready
malt
caramel
and
earth
tastes
of
grapefruit
and
apricot
up
front
then
caramel
toast
and
dank
earth
with
a
dried
grass
and
floral
hop
finish
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
sweet
malty
and
citrus
fruity
with
a
nice
slightly
bitter
finish
a
good
hop
presence
but
nicely
balanced
and
not
too
bittering
just
enough
i
dont
know
if
id
say
this
was
a
british
style
ipa
seemed
a
little
too
citrusy
for
me
but
it
was
pretty
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
wow
i
wasnt
expecting
to
enjoy
this
as
much
as
i
did
imo
this
is
a
layered
and
somewhat
complex
pale
ale
ipa
or
whatever
you
perceive
it
to
be
definitely
worth
a
try
wow
im
pretty
impressed
i
feel
like
boulder
is
always
decent
but
not
always
wowing
this
brew
while
not
incredibly
complex
is
incredibly
solid
with
some
nice
clean
and
green
flavors
i
could
easily
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
smooth
and
light
enough
in
body
for
sessioning
but
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
im
impressed
and
will
definitely
be
drinking
a
few
more
of
these
definitely
worth
a
shot
pours
a
dark
orangecopper
with
a
bubbly
white
head
laces
and
holds
well
to
the
glass
smells
slightly
floral
with
some
citrus
musk
pushing
through
has
some
mild
citrus
hop
with
more
breadiness
coming
through
and
settling
down
enjoyable
not
too
heavy
with
a
good
flavor
not
much
as
far
as
carbonation
a
tasty
and
well
made
beer
i
could
not
drink
this
all
night
maybe
i
am
not
partial
to
english
ales
or
i
need
to
develope
a
tatse
for
them
but
this
brew
does
not
have
the
big
flavors
or
complexity
i
would
expect
pours
a
amberish
orange
with
a
nice
creamy
light
tan
head
that
leaves
some
spotty
lace
the
nose
is
mildly
fruity
with
some
assertive
hops
slightly
bitter
with
a
nice
healthy
amount
of
green
tasting
hops
a
good
amount
of
grapefruitbuttered
toast
and
subtle
caramel
malt
flavors
great
creamy
mouthfeelmedium
bodied
and
refreshing
for
such
a
hoppy
brew
this
is
my
favorite
boulder
beer
brilliant
sort
of
a
hybrid
englishamerican
ipa
great
hop
flavor
with
the
malts
being
slightly
hidden
mfd
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
tasty
and
easily
sessioned
id
drink
this
one
again
its
no
showoff
but
it
is
a
perfectly
pleasant
english
ipa
slight
amber
body
with
a
nice
head
the
diminishes
quickly
very
floral
in
the
nose
and
also
in
the
mouth
seemed
a
little
highly
carbonated
but
was
a
nice
contrast
to
the
hoppiness
very
easy
drinkability
and
not
very
filling
at
all
would
definitely
reccomend
not
the
greatest
ipa
i
ever
had
but
worth
the
three
bucks
or
so
another
nice
beer
to
add
to
their
repertoire
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
very
nice
inch
of
pillowy
white
head
smell
is
subtle
hops
taste
is
mellow
hops
with
a
bit
of
mild
bitterness
this
is
a
decent
beer
just
doesnt
seem
to
come
together
really
smooth
and
seems
quite
sessionable
but
at
6
5
this
one
will
catch
up
with
you
decent
but
nothing
extraordinary
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
is
the
runofthemill
hoppy
near
ipa
i
just
tried
this
beer
on
a
whim
and
i
loved
it
it
has
an
extremely
hoopy
aroma
to
it
pours
a
nice
amber
orange
with
an
off
white
head
the
inital
taste
is
awesome
it
is
full
of
fresh
hops
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
had
they
go
down
extremely
smooth
also
there
is
a
high
drinability
to
this
brew
a
must
try
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ipa
that
i
would
purchase
again
in
a
heartbeat
recommended
good
lace
sticky
no
head
pale
ale
orange
amber
about
right
smells
like
a
standard
bottled
pale
ale
with
not
much
to
define
it
a
little
fruit
and
a
little
of
the
malt
about
average
creamy
swallow
with
odd
rye
component
on
the
aftertaste
and
a
tealike
tar
overtone
but
there
is
bitter
at
the
end
that
has
a
little
punch
unusual
and
extra
credit
for
the
rye
flavor
because
this
is
an
english
style
i
knew
this
was
going
to
be
subdued
and
while
the
taste
is
mellow
the
hop
sting
at
the
end
makes
this
surprising
tarry
hops
slightly
bitter
at
the
start
but
not
overpowering
rye
note
in
the
flavor
more
on
the
aftertaste
candy
like
in
the
center
also
not
overpowering
malt
is
subdued
leaving
hops
and
water
as
the
main
components
well
this
is
odd
tasty
blends
well
and
has
that
hops
burn
at
the
end
not
bad
at
all
a
typical
ipa
but
well
done
bit
above
average
nice
orange
color
with
head
that
laces
well
floral
and
citrusy
hops
lend
it
a
nice
aroma
and
the
taste
is
good
light
hop
wallop
makes
it
easy
drinking
however
high
abv
makes
me
unable
to
have
more
than
two
of
these
in
a
row
also
not
easily
found
by
myself
if
its
easy
to
find
for
you
its
a
solid
ipa
choice
but
not
an
exceptional
ipa
basically
its
something
between
a
typical
ipa
and
an
excellent
ipa
mmmm
english
ipa
the
aroma
is
a
little
plain
but
not
necessarily
off
with
more
earthy
grapefruit
definite
english
grains
in
the
flavor
for
that
dry
biscuity
undertone
and
with
grassy
herbal
floral
and
somewhat
citrus
hops
dominating
crisper
than
your
average
eipa
theres
certainly
an
american
influence
here
and
while
it
fits
into
the
style
it
stands
out
worth
a
try
if
you
dig
the
style
and
want
something
different
very
refreshing
and
well
crafted
overall
i
would
recomend
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
amber
with
a
fairly
nice
initial
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
but
leaves
some
nice
lacing
smells
very
herbal
and
of
fresh
hops
that
have
allowed
to
decompose
slightly
unfortunately
that
same
wilted
hop
herbal
flavor
is
there
for
me
in
the
taste
i
just
cant
get
over
that
slightly
back
of
the
vegetable
crisper
flavor
dont
know
if
its
the
type
of
hops
or
hops
allowed
to
spoil
but
i
just
cant
drink
this
mouthfeel
is
adequeteappropriately
carbonated
ans
smooth
but
i
just
cant
get
over
the
flavor
d
what
a
tasty
brew
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
its
not
really
sessionable
but
rather
something
i
could
have
after
a
day
of
work
d
a
sessionable
but
still
hoppy
beer
good
american
take
on
the
style
pours
a
pure
golden
straw
color
with
small
head
and
very
little
lacing
you
can
smell
the
hops
kind
of
has
a
tart
smell
to
it
pretty
sweet
hops
very
present
initially
floral
notes
and
a
tart
taste
as
well
it
almost
feels
like
it
has
a
glue
taste
to
it
taste
pretty
weak
good
carbonation
medium
bodied
decent
beer
not
one
of
my
favorites
and
i
wasnt
impressed
with
a
name
like
cold
hop
it
could
really
use
more
of
a
hop
taste
d
i
love
wet
hopped
beers
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
liked
this
one
more
than
most
i
have
tried
very
nice
the
aroma
and
flavor
outweigh
the
moderate
bitterness
but
its
dangerously
downable
and
can
knock
you
flat
on
your
back
d
overall
a
nice
session
ipa
from
the
other
side
hoppier
than
i
expected
d
very
drinkable
despite
the
6
5
abv
this
one
could
really
sneak
up
on
you
this
is
a
good
beer
balanced
yet
still
enough
hops
to
satisfy
the
hardest
hophead
i
think
i
will
explore
more
traditional
english
ipas
to
see
how
the
style
holds
up
i
would
really
like
to
try
this
in
a
cask
mouthfeel
is
rich
malts
predominate
hops
complement
very
drinkable
a
bit
too
much
octane
for
a
session
beer
but
it
would
be
nice
letting
a
few
of
these
catch
up
with
you
a
nice
american
take
on
a
british
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
a
nice
american
take
on
a
british
ipa
creamy
fullbodied
and
slightly
tart
delicious
drinkability
incredibly
easy
drinking
for
an
ipa
i
love
when
this
one
comes
around
a
no
hangups
no
frills
ipa
with
a
bit
of
distinct
english
flavors
dry
and
enjoyable
but
not
hoppy
enough
for
me
its
decent
and
worth
a
try
d
another
strong
effort
from
boulder
brewing
to
stand
right
next
to
their
other
excellent
looking
glass
brews
a
very
drinkable
ipa
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
the
flavor
is
like
drinking
mother
earthgrassy
clean
with
some
hints
of
orange
backed
by
malt
but
definatley
not
as
strong
a
malt
character
as
others
very
light
in
the
mouth
and
while
the
hops
are
wonderful
they
dont
leave
they
oily
almost
resin
lingering
in
my
mouth
the
aftertaste
is
almost
dry
i
can
definately
tell
the
difference
between
this
and
more
traditional
american
ipas
im
scoring
the
drinkability
high
on
this
one
its
much
cleaner
in
the
mouth
with
a
6
5
abv
so
several
of
these
go
down
easily
im
sad
its
such
a
limited
release
otherwise
id
roate
it
throughout
the
year
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
is
clear
light
orange
color
with
a
3finger
head
that
lasted
until
the
beer
was
gone
the
smell
is
light
citrus
hops
seems
american
hops
although
the
beer
is
called
britishstyle
ale
i
got
some
grapefruit
and
apricot
although
not
too
strong
the
taste
was
ok
the
hops
put
some
bitterness
into
the
mix
and
the
malts
played
a
bigger
role
than
they
did
with
the
aroma
id
say
the
beer
has
a
standard
body
and
is
very
drinkable
due
to
its
light
flavors
and
alcohol
content
i
enjoyed
this
american
take
on
the
british
style
it
is
certainly
more
aggressively
hopped
but
it
still
maintains
an
overall
balance
and
subtlety
the
toasted
malt
character
is
full
flavored
i
would
consider
this
an
interesting
session
beer
dfor
some
reason
this
is
just
not
doing
it
for
me
i
like
boulders
other
beers
but
this
just
seems
too
acidic
and
not
hoppy
enough
for
what
it
tries
to
be
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
in
body
all
in
all
nothing
major
but
not
a
bad
brew
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
worth
a
shot
d
an
above
average
pale
ale
due
to
the
high
levels
of
hops
this
doesnt
really
seem
all
that
english
in
character
but
its
a
really
solid
beer
nonetheless
medium
amount
of
carbonation
easy
to
drink
i
think
id
like
to
give
this
one
another
try
make
sure
its
more
recently
bottled
drinkability
is
good
as
well
not
the
prettiest
beer
to
look
at
but
it
tastes
good
and
would
be
a
decent
session
choice
clear
amber
in
color
with
a
white
head
full
of
small
bubbles
that
linger
for
some
time
and
then
subside
to
a
substantial
18
cover
sweet
fruity
aroma
with
earthy
notes
earthy
taste
some
sweetness
a
bit
of
dryness
and
bitterness
at
the
end
to
me
it
seems
slightly
unbalanced
yet
it
is
very
drinkable
drinkability
medium
drinkability
overall
as
well
on
this
beer
not
memorable
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
give
me
an
english
english
ipa
any
day
the
american
imitation
just
isnt
cutting
the
mustard
drinkability
a
very
nice
ipa
for
sessioning
the
bitterness
doesnt
overwhelm
but
doesnt
let
up
either
body
pours
to
a
honey
orange
amber
hosting
a
inch
and
a
half
of
fuzzy
light
tan
head
with
nice
staying
power
leaves
slight
scattered
lace
hops
on
the
nose
are
very
creamy
and
slightly
piney
with
a
sweet
tart
candy
like
buzz
enters
the
mouth
with
sharp
tangy
grassy
hop
presence
the
hop
feel
is
very
woodsy
and
raw
leafy
like
a
different
experience
hop
wise
as
this
beer
is
very
green
makes
me
want
to
hug
a
tree
there
is
a
bit
of
balance
mid
palate
with
some
malt
presence
a
bit
of
citrus
does
come
through
as
the
beer
warms
nicely
drinkable
with
a
unique
hop
feel
mouthfeel
has
a
welcomed
hop
bitter
thickness
d
very
nice
drinkability
with
a
nice
pale
malt
backbone
that
stands
well
against
the
strong
citrusy
hopping
from
a
22
oz
bottle
this
poured
a
nice
apricot
color
with
light
yellow
head
that
was
big
and
fizzy
and
left
great
lacing
nose
of
piney
and
fruity
hops
light
malts
and
a
touch
of
flowers
good
rich
mouthfeel
flavor
is
of
fruits
and
hops
and
there
is
nice
long
bitter
finish
very
enjoyable
to
drink
probably
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
boulder
nice
beer
good
price
and
recommended
overall
for
1
99
i
would
buy
this
again
for
sure
nothing
spectacular
but
cost
per
taste
unit
is
quite
high
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
pound
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
di
enjoyed
what
this
beer
had
to
offer
and
id
like
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
since
the
condition
of
the
one
i
just
bought
is
disappointinggreat
physique
but
no
spirit
it
definitely
demonstrated
it
is
worthy
of
a
second
opinion
beer
poured
an
orange
color
with
a
2
finger
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
nice
lacing
behind
nose
is
somewhat
biscuity
with
hints
of
citrusy
hops
initial
taste
was
very
much
an
american
pa
a
blend
of
biscuity
malted
barley
with
west
coast
hops
providing
a
nice
citrus
finish
a
twist
was
that
i
caught
some
orange
in
the
initial
sips
subsequent
sips
suggest
the
hints
of
uk
hopping
influence
as
apple
is
present
as
i
progress
thru
the
bomber
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
almost
a
full
bodied
beer
for
the
style
overall
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
notes
this
is
the
second
solid
offering
in
a
row
from
boulder
i
also
enjoyed
their
never
summer
ale
a
few
weeks
back
if
i
lived
in
colorado
this
would
make
the
perfect
house
beer
its
flavorful
but
not
overthetop
strong
in
any
way
e
g
hops
alcohol
its
a
little
pricey
here
to
be
a
house
beer
but
this
would
be
a
solid
offering
to
regularly
have
on
hand
check
it
out
d
very
smooth
and
balanced
w
a
nice
blend
of
malty
fruity
and
bitter
very
citrusy
yet
mellow
almost
limey
w
a
spice
and
rind
flavor
that
has
a
hint
of
dry
ale
flavor
and
booziness
very
satisfying
and
drinkable
kudos
to
boulder
a
testament
also
to
the
godfather
of
homebrewing
charlie
papazian
w
a
fine
fresh
and
well
crafted
english
inspired
american
offering
one
thing
i
would
have
liked
to
see
is
maybe
a
little
more
of
a
spicy
grassy
hop
flavor
with
a
slightly
lighter
bitterness
for
more
of
an
english
style
on
the
other
hand
i
really
liked
this
beer
as
it
was
so
why
fix
what
isnt
broken
final
verdict
hazed
infused
with
english
malts
recommended
try
from
boulder
beer
i
do
think
i
like
hazed
better
though
the
flavor
isnt
all
that
great
for
an
english
or
american
ipa
it
is
decent
however
and
slightly
above
average
for
its
style
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
malty
spicy
than
the
sweet
floral
aroma
mouthfeel
is
overly
carbonated
and
the
body
is
dry
and
bitter
with
a
decent
sticky
sweet
finish
overall
cold
hop
isnt
phenomenal
but
it
does
satisfy
the
basic
requirements
of
a
hoppy
english
ipa
as
well
as
a
beer
thats
got
enough
depth
to
keep
me
temporarily
interested
a
rich
tawny
gold
with
a
little
orange
topped
by
a
thin
but
persistent
creamcolored
head
read
the
label
saying
it
was
a
british
style
ale
and
expected
an
earthy
fuggle
or
goldings
hop
aroma
and
got
a
snootful
of
citrus
and
pine
typical
of
the
northwest
us
instead
not
bad
mind
you
but
unexpected
like
a
keith
moon
drum
solo
in
the
middle
of
a
beethoven
symphony
the
malt
is
a
solid
sweet
presence
in
the
aroma
and
really
keeps
the
hopping
of
this
beer
quite
pleasantly
in
balance
the
beer
is
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
for
anything
but
an
ipa
but
a
second
or
third
round
would
certainly
not
be
excessive
certainly
worth
the
price
of
admission
but
one
that
i
think
would
be
better
classified
as
an
american
ipa
and
let
folks
rave
about
how
nicely
you
crafted
that
nice
malt
body
than
claim
british
heritage
and
get
knocked
like
here
for
malting
like
a
deutschmann
and
hopping
like
a
yankee
a
decent
beer
but
not
terribly
interesting
i
dont
regret
drinking
it
but
theres
nothing
really
here
for
me
to
go
back
to
either
drinkability
didnt
know
exactly
what
to
expect
here
but
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
nice
change
of
pace
too
for
those
of
us
used
to
american
ipas
this
offers
a
nice
alternative
while
still
delivering
the
robust
hops
and
flavor
we
all
love
all
in
all
a
good
brew
that
you
should
try
if
you
get
a
shot
d
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
ipa
good
hops
but
not
overwhelming
a
very
good
beer
id
say
its
worth
a
try
a
standard
english
ipa
but
with
the
hopping
rates
expected
from
the
american
stle
a
firm
malty
marzenlike
malt
base
has
a
crisp
lightly
crusty
wellattenuated
character
that
balances
well
with
a
healty
dose
of
pine
pungent
resinous
hops
that
linger
well
after
the
sip
is
gone
beyond
that
the
fruitiness
esters
are
light
allowing
the
malt
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
to
set
the
tone
for
the
brew
the
beer
remains
a
murky
amber
rust
color
throughout
with
expected
head
formationretention
to
hold
throughout
the
beer
attenuates
in
a
very
american
sort
of
way
not
allowing
the
heavy
sweetness
to
remain
as
it
does
in
english
pales
however
the
grain
flavors
are
softer
and
less
husklike
as
found
in
american
ales
a
nice
blend
of
both
pours
a
foggy
orange
amber
nose
is
very
piney
hops
with
that
sweet
character
to
it
flavor
is
very
hopped
but
in
a
noticeably
english
style
i
feel
like
it
purposefully
subdues
itself
and
never
gets
out
of
hand
as
many
american
versions
of
the
style
might
the
hops
present
themselves
and
then
an
earthy
bitter
tone
hits
you
feel
has
a
bit
of
carbonation
to
it
the
liquid
is
thick
though
it
gives
a
thick
slick
and
syrupy
texture
on
the
mouth
overall
very
good
definitely
one
for
the
hop
heads
and
possibly
one
for
the
real
ale
folks
out
there
too
d
a
solid
session
ipa
id
pick
up
a
6pack
if
i
ever
saw
it
in
pa
this
is
beer
is
good
well
balanced
and
refreshing
solid

could
easily
drink
this
all

long
pours
a

aroma
is
hard
to
pin
down
strong

background
with
piney

the
piney

come
through
in
the
flavor
theres
also
a
light
citrus
flavor
in
the
mix
a
bready
malt
holds
it
together
theres
a
longlasting
hop
after
taste
seems
to
be
a
classic
english
ipa
seems
to
me
to
be
about
as
good
as
anything
the
brits
are
putting
out
these
days
i
really
have
little
to
complain
about
this
beer
its
actually
quite
good
good
representation
of
the
style
d
well
as
yet
another
biased
ipa
lover
yabipal
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
and
was
happy
to
have
received
it
along
with
the
others
i
have
yet
to
try
i
like
it
and
would
definitely
have
another
if
i
didnt
only
have
2
left
would
probably
order
several
at
the
pub
as
well
if
it
were
around
enjoyable
give
it
a
shot
if
you
see
it
a
unique
take
on
a
british
style
ipa
given
the
the
cold
hopping
and
creaminess
a
little
grapefruity
and
some
malt
offset
a
tad
of
toastiness
in
the
aroma
and
taste
as
well
lace
dots
golden
yellow

easy
drinking
and
i
could
finish
a
few
of
these
over
a
week
pours
easily
down
the
gullet
llight
on
the
tongue
and
tastes
great
a
tad
on
the
colder
side
im
guessing
3638ish
i
had
waited
months
to
try
this
not
being
a
fan
of
rather
bland
imo
english
ales
but
the
bottle
and
carrier
art
always
drew
my
attention
im
glad
i
did
this
is
an
interesting
beer
final
note
this
beer
provides
the
hop
bite
i
am
looking
for
in
a
well
made
and
well
balanced
beer
drinkability
nice
easy

mouthfeel

clean
with
the

doing
its
thing
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
i
did
find
my
palate
crushed
very
easy

if
abv
wasnt

this
would
make
a
very
good

a

pretty

overal
this
is
a

beer
the
malt
is
malty
enough
but
not
too
sweet
and
the
hops
are
just
right
to
enjoy
there
is
nothing
that
stands
out
to
make
this
beer
outstanding
but
it
is
good
upon
its
departing
the
22
ounce
bottle
the
beer
presents
a
somewhat
hazy
deep
amber
orange
color
with
a
skyscraper
sized
creamy

that
lingers
long
and
upon
its
vanishing

a

the
complaint
here
just
something
weird
about
the
feel
this

isnt

i
had
this
at
an
irish
pub
in
nj
if
this
ipa
is
the
best
nj
has
to
offer
i
dont
think
i
ever
want
to
try
another
beer
from
the
state
this
ipa
tasted
like
hops
mixed
with
vomit
ok
i
might
be
a
little
too
harsh
here
but
it
was
lacking
severely
its
like
an
ingredient
was
left
out
the
potential
was
there
but
never
arrived
almost
like
a
sneeze
that
dies
out
right
before
it
happens
very
disappointed
with
my
choice
even
more
so
since
they
had
some
fine
great
lakes
beer
on

stay
away
o
easy

drink
balanced
nothing
really
exciting
but
nothing
really
bad
o
just
a
really
lame
east

style
ipa
o
a
real
easy
drinker
nicely
balanced
a
good
american
example
of
the
english
style
received
as
a
sixer
as
a
gift
something
i
would
buy
if
it
were
available
overall
its
decent
i
like
a
good
amount
of
aroma
and
found
that
disappointing
seems
like
a
lot
of
cascade
hops
as
well
which
are
a
classic
treat
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
was
its
flavoring
we
had
a
bit
of
a
shock
when
we
first
opened
this
beer
took
a
whiff
and
sipped
it
because
generally
speaking
it
has
that
same
luster
of
fresh
hoppy
goodness
possessed
by
both
sucks
and
heady
topper
things
were
fruity
fresh
and
confidently
smooth
and
it
tasted
just
like
it
smelled
the
hops
throughout
were
thickly
resinous
and
heady
with
sticky
oiliness
that
went
on
for
days
that
said
as
the
beer
warmed
and
with
a
second
serving
of
it
it
began
to
fade
the
edges
seemed
just
a
bit
cheaper
with
more
metallics
and
less
smoothness
to
the
sip
that
said
we
were
transiently
enhanced
by
this
one
but
it
just
didnt
seem
to
possess
that
reproducibility
and
longevity
that
keeps
you
coming
back
to
your
favorite
beers
time
and
time
again
overall
i
feel
like
the
reviews
on
this
beer
are
overly
harsh
or
perhaps
the
recipe
was
changed
yes
it
is
definitely
is
a
breadbutter
ipa
nothing
to
interesting
lots
of
cascade
but
honestly
sometimes
thats
a
good
thing
its
a
solid
product
and
i
would
probably
buy
it
again
great
for
introducing
someone
to
a
simple
basic
ipa
drinkable
but
nothing
special
that
head
though
overall
a
light
ipa
crisp
citrus
and
refreshing
i
am
not
seeing
most
of
the
same
negative
qualities
on
some
of
the
older
review
again
i
am
guessing
this
is
a
reformulation
attempt
i
did
notice
that
it
is
a
little
on
the
tart
side
but
otherwise
this
is
a
decent
brew
would
not
recommend
this
one
to
hop
heads
necessarily
and
if
i
did
i
would
call
the
hops
lemonade
hops
not
really
my
favorite
style
o
decent
better
than
i
expected
to
be
honest
given
the
reviews
here
and
the
reputation
of
this
brewer
maybe
i
got
one
thats
uberfresh
ill
check
the
bottle
for
dating
info
i
bought
a
single
bottle
at
price
chopper
and
doubt
id
buy
a
full
sixer
of
this
there
are
so
many
ipas
that
i
like
better
than
this
but
im
not
unhappy
with
the
purchase
at
all
o
this
beer
is
probably
a
slight
amount
hoppier
and
more
bitter
than
i
expected
in
an
english
ipa
but
it
is
still
enjoyable
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
the
flavors
of
the
hops
come
through
nicely
and
are
not
quite
as
subdued
as
some
others
in
the
style
enjoyable
and
one
i
would
likely
order
again
o
this
beer
seems
a
little
hoppier
and
bitter
compared
to
other
english
ipas
but
has
a
nice
amount
of
flavors
of
hops
this
beer
is
almost
what
i
would
have
expected
its
dominated
by
bready
malts
with
a
nice
citrusy
hop
character
unfortunately
it
has
an
intense
creamy
soapy
almost
lactic
offflavor
that
ruins
everything
this
is
definitely
not
a
beer
i
ever
want
to
have
again
o
its
just
ok
12
oz
bottle
pours
hazy
orange
with
a
long
lasting
fluffy
white
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
citrusy
hops
biscuit
malt
pears
and
oranges
body
is
medium
and
tangy
citrusy
hops
pale
malt
and
ripe
fruit
fill
the
mouth
long
grapefruity
finish
ok
ipa
o
please
dont
try
this
i
am
reminded
of
one
of
my
earlier
home
brews
that
was
ok
for
a
homebrew
o
not
for
hopheads
fairly
sessionable
abv
could
fit
in
well
at
a
barbecue
overall
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
i
am
huge
ipa
fan
and
before
getting
to
half
glass
this
beer
disappoints
i
cant
say
i
love
it
but
i
cant
hate
cricket
hill
for
trying
salud
d
wow
this
is
terrible
the
hop
character
is
almost
nonexistent
except
for
a
slightly
harsh
and
fairly
strong
bitterness
in
the
finish
it
is
equal
parts
odd
and
bad
and
let
me
be
clear
here
i
am
not
rating
this
poorly
because
it
is
an
english
ipa
and
i
wanted
an
american
ipa
im
rating
this
low
because
it
is
a
bad
beer
by
any
standard
if
anything
it
tastes
like
a
poorly
conceived
wheat
beer
overall
this
is
a
strange
beer
it
would
make
a
decent
witbier
but
this
one
has
little
in
hop
character
poured
from
bottle
into
glass
no
bottle
date
visible
pours
a
light
orangeyellow
color
pretty
cloudy
decent
head
little
retention
smell
floral
tea
leaves
not
what
i
like
on
my
ipas
but
i
guess
to
be
expected
for
an
english
ipa
taste
mild
bitterness
some
toffee
floral
tea
leaves
again
bleh
all
of
this
may
be
good
for
the
style
but
i
really
dont
care
for
it
im
going
to
plead
ignorance
for
the
style
not
knock
this
beer
too
much
for
it
and
move
on
to
the
next
this
ipa
is
semibitter
with
a
floral
hop
taste
and
herbal
tinge
on
first
sip
the
grassy
astringent
aspect
comes
toward
the
middle
with
a
light
toasted
grain
flavor
in
the
background
and
mild
citrusy
acidic
and
light
tropical
accent
the
semi
bitter
taste
continues
after
the
sweet
balanced
finish
overall
i
found
nothing
to
complain
about
yet
it
is
not
a
beer
that
is
stellar
in
the
realm
of
the
style
either
the
taste
and
aroma
are
good
but
nothing
really
sets
this
apart
there
arent
really
any
apparent
flaws
it
is
just
a
good
drinking
beer
with
lots
of
bitterness
the
flavor
is
a
bit
of
a
mess
with
spicy
yeast
esters
hitting
the
palate
aggressively
up
front
again
im
reminded
of
a
belgian
ipa
and
not
a
good
one
at
that
the
hops
provide
enough
tropical
fruitness
to
save
what
is
an
otherwise
unremarkable
ipa
malts
are
almost
nonexistent
the
mouthfeel
is
a
hot
mess
with
huge
bubbles
that
loll
across
the
palate
the
beer
finishes
with
a
medicinal
aftertaste
not
for
me
really
not
good
at
all
not
even
remotely
close
to
an
ipa
hop
profile
with
off
flavors
and
a
thin
mouthfeel
to
boot
its
a
shame
after
how
beautiful
it
looked
ok
nothing
special
o
this
isnt
a
terrible
beer
but
i
wouldnt
pick
it
up
again
unless
i
knew
it
was
fresh
o
a
very
refreshing
anytime
beer
i
wouldnt
consider
this
an
ipa
its
closer
to
a
pale
ale
it
actually
tasted
very
similar
to
appalachian
brewing
companys
mountain
lager
which
is
a
completely
different
style
of
beer
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
this
brew
but
theres
nothing
great
about
it
either
o
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
doesnt
try
to
do
anything
spectacular
but
still
manages
to
produce
something
drinkable
picked
up
single
bottle
of
this
at
a
local
store
since
i
hadnt
seen
it
in
the
state
yet
i
have
to
say
i
was
disappointed
pours
a
quite
hazy
golden
with
very
little
head
what
head
there
is
does
stick
around
as
a
light
swirl
and
leaves
some
scant
lacing
light
notes
of
citrus
and
paraffin
in
the
nose
and
not
much
else
undercarbonated
and
frankly
the
beer
seems
unfinished
with
some
raw
wort
notes
of
a
sweet
graininess
and
a
bit
of
acrid
bitterness
a
tad
grainy
as
well
and
generally
it
has
flavors
that
can
only
be
described
as
murky
there
are
some
faint
citrus
flavors
of
lime
and
orange
but
theyre
generally
lost
in
the
muddle
meh
o
if
you
are
going
to
call
a
beer
an
ipa
you
need
to
be
able
to
smell
and
taste
the
hops
this
was
a
far
cry
from
an
ipa
it
was
lacking
lots
of
hop
aroma
and
if
i
didnt
know
what
style
it
was
i
would
think
i
was
drinking
a
light
lager
overall
decent
beer
nothing
id
rave
about
final
thoughts
very
interesting
ive
been
in
the
mood
for
a
kind
of
funky
beer
but
i
didnt
expect
it
to
be
from
a
random
ipa
the
yeast
on
the
bottom
really
changes
this
beer
the
first
time
i
had
it
i
didnt
realize
it
was
bottle
conditoned
and
it
just
tasted
like
a
plain
ipa
after
that
first
i
realized
it
was
bc
so
this
time
i
got
at
it
and
it
changed
the
beer
totally
i
cant
say
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
but
i
can
say
i
will
not
buy
it
under
the
auspices
of
an
ipa
a
good
postpostlawn
mower
brew
one
to
have
after
that
witbier
hef
or
ipa
you
have
after
the
lawn
this
is
a
average
tasting
ipa
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
on
the
bland
side
cricket
hill
has
so
many
better
brews
than
this
like
their
american
ale
colonel
blides
and
their
shandy
that
they
have
only
at
the
brewery
i
wouldnt
completely
steer
clear
away
from
this
ipa
i
believe
theyre
a
lot
better
ones
out
there
o
if
you
are
going
to
call
a
beer
an
ipa
you
need
to
be
able
to
smell
and
taste
the
hops
this
beer
is
lacking
big
time
in
the
hop
department
its
not
a
bad
beer
if
i
were
reviewing
it
as
an
english
pale
ale
it
would
have
gotten
much
higher
marks
but
if
they
label
it
an
ipa
i
will
review
it
as
such
i
dont
know
how
strong
this
is
in
the
alcohol
department
but
just
like
the
taste
theres
no
punch
to
be
packed
in
terms
of
the
strength
of
this
beer
its
not
a
bad
choice
for
the
summer
and
this
would
go
great
with
thai
food
but
thats
about
all
i
envision
for
this
beer
for
the
casual
drinker
there
are
better
and
more
memorable
choices
on
the
market
theres
no
doubt
that
this
could
use
another
dose
of
hops
to
up
the
ante
pours
a
hazy
yellow
to
orangeish
color
with
a
small
white
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
orange
citrus
in
the
taste
orange
citrus
hops
and
quite
sweet
with
a
lack
of
malt
backing
a
small
hop
bite
and
thin
and
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
orange
citrus
in
the
aftertaste
nice
orange
citrus
but
sweet
and
lack
of
body
and
balance
although
this
is
not
a
strong
ipa
as
some
i
have
tried
it
does
have
the
same
drawbacks
and
the
rest
of
them
it
had
a
hoppy
smell
and
a
stronger
aftertaste
then
what
im
used
to
cricket
hill
did
do
a
good
job
with
this
beer
it
is
a
shame
that
i
did
not
prefer
this
beer
a
good
ipa
it
just
does
not
stand
out
this
beer
was
split
from
cricket
hills
variety
pack
with
a
couple
bas
at
work
it
poured
a
bright
orange
in
color
very
light
and
very
clear
with
a
light
off
white
head
it
smelled
of
pale
malt
with
a
light
orange
twist
this
beer
literally
just
arrived
but
it
smelled
like
a
skunked
dortmunder
there
was
zero
hop
presence
at
all
this
beer
is
definitely
not
an
ipa
not
even
an
english
one
this
beer
has
the
hop
profile
of
miller
lite
it
drank
very
light
and
thin
it
didnt
have
any
of
the
stickyness
or
dryness
that
you
get
from
most
ipas
this
beer
was
an
awful
interpretation
of
the
style
light
orange
with
a
fluffy
eggshell
cap
that
leaves
some
filmy
lace
on
the
glass
herbal
hop
notes
and
sweet
malt
pretty
tame
for
any
kind
of
ipa
white
fleshed
fruit
and
earthy
hops
with
ample
bitterness
and
minerality
medium
bodied
and
creamy
a
decent
tasting
english
style
ipa
and
a
nice
lawnmower
beer
single
twelveounce
bottle
copped
from
total
wine
overall
pretty
good
stuff
a
light
satisfying
ipa
easy
on
the
palate
not
too
pungent
in
aroma
either
hints
of
hops
balanced
with
a
mild
backbone
of
malts
evident
a
local
brewery
comes
good
on
this
british
depiction
of
a
pale
ale
not
bad
d
very
drinkable
if
youre
in
a
pub
and
you
see
it
on
the
hand
pump
ask
the
bar
keep
to
pour
you
one
overall
im
sorry
its
just
somewhat
below
average
for
a
craft
beer
this
beer
has
a
few
of
the
elements
of
a
good
ipa
the
main
thin
that
i
felt
that
was
missed
was
the
big
hoppy
flavors
the
color
was
on
the
copper
side
and
fairly
clear
in
color
the
beer
was
just
a
little
weak
to
me
not
the
greatest
ipa
out
there
d
first
attempt
at
an
english
ipa
interesting
drink
but
im
still
american
give
me
a
regular
ipa
still
a
good
drink
though
just
not
my
style
overall
this
is
a
smooth
easy
drinking
brew
i
am
but
unclear
as
to
why
its
called
hopnotica
as
it
is
definitely
not
that
strong
on
the
hops
for
an
ipa
but
all
the
same
enjoyable
and
a
beer
i
would
drink
again
with
a
burger
and
fries
overall
this
was
a
nice
ipa
i
have
of
course
had
better
and
also
had
much
much
worse
but
this
one
will
definitely
work
i
was
surprised
by
the
balance
it
posed
not
simply
relying
on
a
ton
of
hops
to
push
through
the
flavor
a
really
nice
choice
and
a
good
call
this
brewery
is
within
10
minutes
of
my
house
and
yet
this
is
the
first
bottle
that
ive
bought
i
had
one
of
their
beers
on
tap
at
cloverleaf
tavern
but
cant
remember
which
their
beers
tend
to
be
low
in
abv
and
they
claim
to
concentrate
on
flavor
if
this
is
a
concentrated
effort
then
im
a
bit
disappointed
it
is
good
enough
for
me
to
seek
out
their
other
brews
and
give
them
a
shot
a
tour
of
the
brewery
is
definitely
in
order
due
mostly
to
its
proximity
than
the
result
of
this
offering
d
pretty
low
abv
but
not
as
hoppy
or
flavorful
as
i
was
expecting
pretty
average
overall
fairly
easy
to
drink
if
not
for
the
utter
blandness
and
lack
of
complexity
but
i
suppose
thats
the
style
hv
d
perfectly
publike
a
smallfeeling
ipa
abv
unknown
but
seems
4
55
thats
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
its
a
bit
of
a
misnomer
to
punnily
call
your
beer
hopnotic
when
there
really
isnt
a
big
hop
presence
oh
well
regardless
of
name
this
is
a
beer
i
like
enough
to
have
again
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
d
i
guess
its
not
hard
to
drink
except
you
have
to
get
past
the
bad
taste
very
nicely
balanced
between
hops
and
malt
fits
the
english
ipa
profile
quite
well
enjoyable
d
a
pretty
nice
brew
and
really
a
nice
representation
of
the
english
ipa
not
usually
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
have
enjoyed
each
one
of
these
from
the
6pack
a
little
more
than
the
last
drinkable
ipa
tastes
need
to
be
more
pronounced
this
beer
pours
a
georgous
golden
yellow
orange
color
with
a
small
1
finger
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
really
has
no
aroma
its
got
a
touch
of
bitter
lemony
cake
on
the
nose
but
so
faint
really
lacking
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
that
gives
any
aroma
at
all
no
hops
on
the
nose
for
me
taste
falls
very
flat
i
really
enjoy
there
limited
release
beers
but
this
and
the
american
ale
really
seem
watered
down
and
bland
might
have
a
touch
of
lemony
woodiness
with
very
light
malt
mouthfeel
is
again
a
touch
flat
as
this
brewery
tends
to
be
for
me
the
drinkability
is
high
though
despite
the
lack
of
flavor
because
its
very
very
smooth
its
been
filtered
to
all
hell
i
believe
which
stole
the
hop
bitterness
i
was
looking
for
in
an
ipa
worth
a
shot
and
i
would
take
this
over
gmc
products
all
day
really
the
quintessential
sports
drinking
beer
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
a
honey
yellow
with
a
slight
white
head
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
grassy
the
taste
follows
the
nose
the
finish
lingers
with
an
appropriate
amount
of
bitterness
medium
in
body
average
carbonation
imo
kind
of
sweet
for
an
ipa
but
it
is
nicely
hopped
and
a
solid
brew
as
a
summer
time
beer
i
can
warmly
recommend
this
while
for
the
most
part
i
do
prefer
richer
denser
beer
for
something
on
the
milder
lighter
side
of
the
spectrum
this
is
pretty
good
while
thin
flavors
are
clean
and
focused
thanks
to
hopflop
for
this
one
served
from
bottle
into
a
samuel
smith
imperial
pint
pours
a
nice
hazy
yelloworange
with
a
minimal
white
head
lacing
was
minimal
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
malt
and
subtle
hop
notes
the
flavor
was
of
subtle
hops
and
malt
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
very
smooth
for
an
ipa
and
is
quite
drinkable
if
you
enjoy
ipas
with
subtle
flavors
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
try
this
one

smell
is
a
strange
alcohollygrapish
mixture
in
a
agood
way
first
sipfirst
impression
this
is
the
most
poundable
ipa
ive
ever
had
mouthfeel
is
that
of
a
cool
river
downstream
from
choice
hop
factory
china
doll
btw
hops
are
very
tasty
not
overpowering
by
any
means
but
tasty
in
a
kinda
slow
cooked
way
before
reading
the
other
reviews
id
assume
that
the
knock
will
be
its
lack
of
boldness
but
i
see
that
as
a
nice
alternative
to
standard
ipas
market
this
properly
and
youd
have
a
mainstream
brew
this
song
is
too
slow
fast
forawrd
sugar
magnolia
much
better
anyway
yes
this
is
a
well
made
lighter
ipa
perfectly
balanced
tasty
drinkable
and
good
looking
sunshine
daydream
indeed
smells
of
sweet
champagne
and
pours
clear
golden
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
looks
nice
no
pine
or
citrus
like
typical
ipas
taste
is
very
mild
toasted
champagne
flavors
come
through
it
almost
think
they
might
have
put
the
lager
into
an
ipa
bottle
not
a
bad
beer
but
dont
be
fooled
by
the
name
this
most
certainly
isnt
an
ipa
overall
a
good
ia
for
those
who
hate
ipas
pours
a
pretty
clear
orange
with
a
large
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
clean
and
citrusy
though
not
distinctive
flavor
however
is
not
great
there
is
some
light
fruit
apricot
and
peach
with
some
delicate
jasminy
hop
character
but
there
is
a
briny
quality
that
overwhelms
the
beer
it
is
salty
and
a
bit
metallic
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
dense
and
briny
not
so
great
this
is
an
easytoconsume
beer
best
suited
with
food
and
casual
situations
drinkability
this
is
a
workman
like
beer
with
nothing
particularly
outstanding
or
challenging
in
its
character
it
is
a
good
session
beer
in
that
one
can
drink
several
of
them
at
a
sitting
each
sip
leads
easily
onto
the
next
and
then
the
beer
is
gone
that
being
said
there
is
no
particular
reason
to
seek
out
this
beer
or
to
have
it
again
unless
it
is
your
local
brew
good
but
nothing
outstanding
however
it
does
match
my
expectations
for
an
english
style
ipa
intended
to
be
easily
drinkable
and
attractive
to
a
local
audience
not
really
too
much
to
get
excited
about
here
and
i
had
high
hopes
having
spent
my
formative
years
in
nj
thanks
to
caresville
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
brew
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
a
translucent
light
copper
color
with
a
slightly
golden
hue
when
backlit
half
inch
fizzy
white
head
slowly
recedes
into
a
broken
skim
some
strands
of
lacing
evident
during
the
tasting
copious
tiny
bubble
present
in
solution
not
much
of
a
nose
light
malt
maybe
taste
not
really
too
ipaish
malty
a
little
sweet
some
citrus
acidity
maybe
a
little
bit
of
interplay
of
hops
in
there
but
kind
of
like
an
apa
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slightly
prickly
not
really
much
of
an
ipa
but
i
could
drink
a
couple
just
seems
to
be
missing
some
of
the
qualities
you
look
for
in
the
style
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
a
slender
pils
glass
pours
a
hazy
orange
to
amber
with
some
carbonation
and
decent
sized
white
as
cloud
head
also
some
noticeable
lacing
is
present
smell
is
mostly
grass
hay
straw
with
notes
of
oranges
and
faint
hops
taste
is
surprisingly
hoppy
i
am
saying
this
because
of
the
faint
hops
smell
and
crisp
notes
of
oranges
pears
and
grapefruit
not
overly
bitter
but
it
is
there
on
the
swallow
easily
a
great
brew
to
throw
down
a
few
of
while
doing
yard
work
on
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
thin
beige
head
nice
lacing
nose
is
quite
grainy
with
some
pale
malts
and
grassy
hops
taste
more
like
an
english
mild
than
ipa
hops
are
quite
mellow
as
are
the
malts
light
body
lacks
carbonation
and
is
thin
in
the
finish
not
very
impressed
by
this
one
overall
a
tasty
and
well
balanced
ale
d
drink
easy
enough
and
probably
has
at
least
somewhat
low
abv
pretty
good
on
style
points
its
just
not
very
tasty
or
interesting
drinkability
hop
heads
will
enjoy
this
beer
could
be
a
touch
more
balanced
but
still
quite
good
my
first
beer
from
nj
not
bad
at
all
drinkability
since
i
like
english
ipas
i
can
say
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
tasty
the
abv
isnt
listed
but
id
guess
that
it
is
under
6
i
could
be
wrong
very
good
sessionable
ipa
in
my
book
light
to
mediu
bodied
beer
decent
selection
but
not
my
go
to
beer
perhaps
herea
the
bech
it
may
become
my
goto
beer
md
light
body
ends
a
little
dry
a
little
sticky
but
seems
reasonable
really
easy
to
drink
not
sure
on
the
abv
but
seems
low
enough
to
session
this
may
not
be
everyones
cup
of
hops
its
much
more
of
a
subdued
ipa
than
anyone
jonesing
for
their
hop
fix
may
be
looking
for
this
one
makes
me
think
of
fuggles
ipa
by
shipyard
another
englishstyle
ipa
ill
have
to
give
their
jersey
summer
breakfast
ale
a
try
next
time
i
am
down
that
way
the
feel
is
fizzy
and
decently
bodied
its
a
heavilymalted
englishstyle
ipa
the
hops
are
but
an
accent
not
bad
but
not
exciting
bottle
pours
a
clear
light
orange
with
a
very
small
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
fruits
grapefruit
and
light
citrus
flavor
is
mostly
malty
with
some
melon
and
citrus
too
definitely
not
very
hoppy
but
its
still
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
easy
to
drink
too
d
as
ipas
go
this
one
is
probably
pretty
average
maybe
a
good
starter
for
someone
a
little
intimidated
by
bitter
ales
looking
to
try
something
new
on
one
hand
this
is
apparently
supposed
to
be
an
english
ipa
on
the
other
hand
it
doesnt
say
english
on
the
label
plus
it
has
a
name
like
hopnotic
so
i
think
its
reasonable
to
expect
some
hoppiness
the
color
is
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
minimal
head
the
smell
is
a
bready
yeasty
smell
the
taste
is
a
yeasty
breadish
taste
with
a
fairly
sweet
malt
component
not
much
hops
to
speak
of
though
carbonation
is
about
right
as
a
pale
ale
or
maybe
an
amber
this
would
have
gotten
much
higher
marks
but
even
as
an
english
ipa
its
sorely
lacking
in
hop
flavor
still
a
drinkable
brew
and
enjoyable
on
its
own
merits
though
i
might
just
pour
this
smells
of
oranges
allspice
bananas
cream
and
flowers
wellrounded
scent
id
say
mouthfeel
is
crisp
yet
creamy
as
it
goes
down
flavor
is
of
muted
hop
bitterness
finishing
ever
so
slightly
spicy
nice
malt
balance
on
this
one
if
you
were
expecting
a
hop
bomb
this
is
not
it
as
most
of
the
reviewers
apparently
were
remember
this
is
an
english
style
not
american
and
as
an
english
ipa
this
is
spot
on
from
my
experience
it
is
perfectly
blended
with
the
hints
of
bitterness
and
malty
sweetness
recommend
the
taste
does
have
some
bittering
hop
but
it
is
leafy
rather
than
oily
or
estery
and
the
sweet
malt
and
bubble
gum
like
candy
flavored
notes
just
shouldnt
be
there
the
beer
has
a
hop
balanced
with
the
malts
but
the
hop
isnt
dry
enough
for
an
english
ipa
nor
oily
enough
for
a
nouvelle
american
version
of
the
same
there
is
just
a
leafy
bitterness
that
isnt
that
special
the
sweet
malts
citrus
bubblegum
in
the
background
is
just
silly
this
beer
is
okay
but
cricket
hill
has
a
long
way
to
go
there
beer
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
poured
a
medium
amber
with
a
small
head
light
citrus
and
floral
aroma
and
tastes
neither
over
powering
ive
had
this
on
more
than
a
few
occasions
and
each
time
i
rerate
it
my
numbers
go
down
maybe
ill
have
to
stop
trying
this
one
ignoring
the
label
this
is
a
fine
beer
pours
a
orange
hue
with
everlasting
head
this
is
my
favorite
out
of
the
sampler
12
pack
from
crickethill
a
hoppy
beer
you
can
drink
a
few
of
this
is
what
an
ipa
was
10
years
ago
before
somebody
decided
to
crank
120
ibus
in
there
beer
and
set
the
new
ipa
style
d
ones
enough
not
enjoyable
or
flavorful
enough
to
be
a
session
or
to
justify
a
the
cost
of
a
sixpack
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
fails
as
an
ipa
doesnt
have
the
grassy
hoppy
aroma
that
ive
come
to
expect
from
other
ipas
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
small
white
head
lightly
citrus
taste
that
lacks
a
hoppy
punch
its
really
not
a
bad
beer
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
good
but
not
a
good
ipa
pours
a
golden
yelloworange
with
slight
head
that
left
minimal
lacing
slight
citrus
hop
to
the
nose
leading
to
the
same
taste
its
not
as
hoppy
as
i
had
hoped
but
was
just
enough
to
leave
me
wanting
more
this
could
easily
be
a
nice
session
beer
although
its
not
remarkable
a
traditional
ipa
hoppy
yet
balanced
not
over
the
top
like
some
ipas
have
gone
but
enough
punch
to
let
you
know
theres
a
good
amount
of
hops
in
it
nice
color
nice
hoppy
nose
with
a
fairly
malty
backbone
you
can
have
plenty
of
these
without
falling
off
your
stool
a
pretty
good
brew
not
quite
as
hoppy
as
your
typical
ipa
its
very
drinkable
though
in
the
end
its
really
nothing
more
than
a
session
ipa
if
you
like
your
beers
smelling
like
waffle
cones
and
apple
juice
and
tasting
like
grapefruit
then
you
really
need
to
try
this
ipa
body
is
mediumish
with
an
average
mouthfeel
and
less
than
average
drinkability
no
freshness
date
but
it
tastes
past
its
prime
i
did
not
finish
my
12oz
bottle
it
would
be
a
waste
of
carbs
pours
a
nice
darker
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
onefinger
creamy
offwhite
head
which
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
mostly
malts
but
with
a
nice
touch
of
hops
very
slight
citruspines
and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
nice
little
touch
of
hops
and
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
i
like
this
one
d
not
a
bad
ipa
but
nothing
memorable
perhaps
a
bit
too
malty
for
my
tastes
but
it
is
still
tasty
drinks
a
little
more
like
a
pale
ale
new
to
the
area
so
i
decided
to
give
it
a
try
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
minimal
head
that
gives
way
quickly
aroma
is
of
weak
grains
and
a
very
bitter
and
slightly
metallic
smell
taste
is
of
off
tasting
bitterness
slight
citrus
hop
flavors
metallic
notes
hop
spices
aftertaste
is
very
metallic
and
off
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
and
light
bodied
as
far
as
drinkablity
i
am
going
to
have
to
muscle
my
way
through
this
one
pint
their
are
tons
of
ipas
out
there
and
this
one
falls
upon
the
lower
rungs
of
the
ladder
in
my
honest
opinion
i
like
this
beer
more
than
i
thought
i
would
after
the
smell
at
first
i
found
this
beer
to
be
relatively
middleoftheroad
but
after
each
subsequent
sip
it
grows
on
me
more
and
more
the
sweetness
in
this
beer
makes
it
slightly
more
heavy
i
would
still
by
no
means
call
it
heavy
though
it
finishes
clean
and
like
the
apa
sessions
well
a
golden
colored
beer
with
a
decent
citrusy
smell
taste
is
citrus
with
either
honey
or
caramela
good
mixture
for
this
beer
this
beer
holds
its
taste
from
first
to
last
sip
definetly
something
i
would
buy
and
recommend
makes
me
want
to
try
more
products
from
cricket
hill
dont
drink
and
review
overall
i
found
this
offering
from
cricket
hill
to
be
a
pretty
good
eipa
that
is
very
drinkable
and
that
i
grew
fonder
of
over
time
poured
a
bottle
of
this
out
into
a
glass
mug
looked
quite
nice
amber
body
with
a
solid
white
head
retention
was
very
poor
but
it
slowed
down
to
a
decent
lacing
the
smell
was
slightly
hoppy
the
taste
was
decently
hoppy
nothing
too
impressive
it
definitely
did
not
taste
like
an
ipa
maybe
an
apa
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
a
fullbodied
like
an
ipa
the
beer
itself
is
pretty
drinkable
even
though
i
was
not
too
impressed
by
this
by
this
beer
i
was
expecting
more
hops
in
the
taste
but
they
just
were
not
there
drinkability
is
good
a
touch
sweet
but
otherwise
fairly
balanced
and
enjoyable
i
thought
this
was
an
english
style
ipa
and
research
shows
this
to
be
the
correct
case
i
think
this
is
underated
because
people
get
a
drier
pale
plus
hopped
ale
this
is
somewhat
leaf
dry
astringency
and
on
the
bitter
side
it
is
malted
to
ease
drinkability
and
nicely
done
lace
and
small
head
on
orange
nice
beer
well
balanced
had
this
brew
at
philly
craft
fest
wish
i
had
heard
of
this
brewery
before
very
nice
eipa
aromas
subtle
citrusy
hops
with
a
malt
backbone
to
back
it
up
the
malts
are
slightly
sweet
with
medium
body
while
the
hops
settle
in
on
the
end
for
a
refreshing
floral
aftertaste
not
overly
dry
on
the
backend
great
flavors
and
mild
taste
make
this
a
session
ipa
that
will
not
destroy
your
palate
i
may
have
had
a
different
expectation
going
in
when
i
ordered
this
one
anything
labeled
hopnotic
would
seem
to
imply
being
punched
in
the
face
with
hops
kind
of
a
misnomer
but
a
good
english
ipa
i
enjoyed
it
2nd
offering
from
this
brewery
somewhat
hazy
golden
color
nice
sized
head
on
topdecent
carbonation
level
good
grassy
and
citrusy
aroma
flavor
does
much
to
mirror
the
aromavery
nice
quite
grassy
and
grapefruit
like
not
a
full
frontal
hop
assault
but
enough
presence
to
make
the
whole
package
enjoyable
some
good
lingering
malt
sweetness
good
body
overall
an
enjoyable
pale
i
am
suitably
impressed
for
a
brewery
i
have
heard
very
little
about
nice
job
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
i
got
from
an
in
person
trade
with
silks636
on
a
wedding
trip
to
nj
no
freshness
date
on
the
bottle
but
it
was
fine
appearance
was
good
a
nice
pale
hazy
orange
straw
color
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipated
rather
slowly
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
very
floral
with
hints
of
citrus
especially
grapefruit
scents
slight
malt
hint
in
the
back
of
the
nose
taste
is
very
fresh
crisp
and
clean
well
carbonated
with
a
nice
flowing
hop
flavor
milder
hop
bite
but
it
builds
as
it
goes
down
nice
dry
hop
finish
with
many
well
constructed
flavors
nice
aromatic
ipa
with
good
drinkability
and
taste
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
worth
giving
it
a
try
if
you
like
milder
ipas
not
a
very
overpowering
hop
flavor
making
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
consider
drinking
it
quite
often
if
i
could
find
it
near
me
i
would
think
it
would
make
a
decent
all
around
everyday
ipa
slightly
hazy
peach
juice
with
rocky
snowwhite
head
moderate
and
steady
carbonation
nice
mild
aromas
of
apricots
and
orange
peels
with
a
slight
spruce
sap
scent
lingering
in
the
background
amongst
the
faintest
traces
of
sweet
malts
bitter
orange
flavors
begin
the
sip
rounding
out
to
a
sharp
mineral
middle
some
crystal
malt
sweetness
comes
through
near
the
finish
along
with
more
citric
hops
lending
a
freshsqueezed
orange
juice
quality
to
the
final
aspect
of
the
flavor
thintomedium
body
overall
juicy
mouthfeel
somewhat
sharp
and
offdry
this
really
isnt
a
very
complex
ipa
but
i
think
thats
actually
a
very
fine
thing
to
be
sometimes
i
dont
want
to
be
clobbered
with
astounding
flavor
profiles
and
of
course
sometimes
i
really
do
its
refreshing
to
find
a
straightforward
soliddrinking
ipa
like
this
im
glad
the
nice
folks
at
oak
tree
in
south
plainfield

hipped
me
to
this
beer
when
they
included
a
free
cricket
hill
shaker
pint
with
my
last
purchase
which
i
used
to
drink
hopnotic
ipa
naturally
anyway
this
seems
to
be
a
pretty
underrated
beer
and
it
has
my
thorough
recommendation
cricket
hills
hopnotic
ipa
is
quality
beer
and
is
a
more
than
credible
version
of
the
english
ipa
style
i
could
just
as
easily
have
granted
the
higher
flavor
score
since
im
enjoying
the
bottom
half
of
the
bottle
even
more
than
the
top
half
what
the
hell
this
is
a
wellbrewed
beer
that
is
disappearing
remarkably
quickly
i
thing
ill
reward
it
accordingly
overall
seems
to
hit
the
english
ipa
target
very
well
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
though
the
sweetness
is
a
little
to
much
for
the
style
not
one
of
the
better
ipas
out
there
but
might
be
okay
as
an
intro
to
the
style
its
a
very
mild
ipa
cloudy
honey
golden
pour
with
a
head
that
dies
on
contact
nose
of
hops
and
lemon
tastes
woody
with
soome
slight
hops
but
not
really
bitter
at
all
totally
does
not
fit
the
ipa
mold
it
runs
down
the
gullet
a
little
too
smooth
no
sprakly
bite
to
pick
things
up
a
bit
not
an
enjoyable
beer
m
d
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
alrightnot
great
but
just
alright
average
more
or
less
smooth
and
oily
mouthfeel
with
not
much
aftertastemalts
are
more
lingering
than
hops
carbonation
is
pretty
good
and
not
too
pronounced
drinkability
is
high
as
its
an
easy
drinker
pretty
good
but
there
are
better
i
think
i
like
the
cricket
better
than
the
brews
themselves
but
this
was
a
decent
ipa
had
the
necessary
hoppy
and
citrus
kicks
with
a
fair
amount
of
sweet
malts
a
decent
frothy
mouthfeel
and
was
very
easy
to
drink
but
it
lacked
depth
for
me
id
love
to
have
a
sixer
or
two
in
the
back
of
my
fridge
for
everyday
thirstquenching
drinking
but
i
wouldnt
order
it
if
i
went
out
still
nothing
to
frown
at
12
ounce
bottle
cricket
hill
ipa
pours
out
a
dirty
looking
orange
brown
color
with
a
medium
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
herbal
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
the
flavor
starts
out
sweet
and
fruity
with
lemons
and
peaches
herbal
grassy
flavors
come
in
a
the
middle
this
beer
is
not
very
hoppy
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
there
is
a
pleasant
level
of
carbonation
a
little
buttery
drinkability
is
average
mediocre
pale
ale
overall
glad
i
tried
this
but
dont
know
ifwhen
ill
go
for
it
again
with
the
other
great
ipas
out
there
this
beer
is
really
quite
well
balanced
between
the
malt
and
the
hops
it
is
almost
more
of
a
pale
ale
than
anything
it
is
quite
tasty
though
and
is
definitely
a
good
offering
that
i
am
happy
to
be
drinking
at
this
moment
amber

with
bottled

poured
a

with
slight

smell
is
sweet
and
slightly

totally
lacking
in

smell
is
not
very
pleasnt
at
all
and
each
taste
reminds
me
of
it
taste
is
very
dry
and
bitter
with
a
lowlevel
maltiness
trying
to
break
through
finished
th
more
dry
bitterness
not
too
good
a
beer
my
first
beer
from
ricket
hill
and
im
very
dissapointed
easy
to
consume
a
whole
lot
of
and
maybe
a
decent
beer
to
introduce
new
micro
beer
drinkers
to
the
style
since
the
flavor
is
a
little
lacking
break
them
in
however
just
boring
imo
a
buttery
flavor
hangs
around
making
the
mouthfeel
slightly
cloying
and
less
then
refreshing
carbonation
is
a
bit
less
than
where
id
like
to
see
it
making
this
one
just
average
for
me
i
wont
buy
this
one
again
overall
my
6
pack
might
be
a
little
old
i
dont
know
but
it
has
a
slight
skunky
aroma
otherwise
the
beer
is
an
entry
level
ipa
not
very
powerful
perfect
for
your
budweiser
buddies
12
ounce
bottle
i
found
in
the
cooler
of
the
restaurant
eccola
italian
bistro
in
parsippany
nj
the
waitress
originally
said
they
had
no
microbrews
but
i
saw
the
sixer
in
the
cooler
and
asked
again
and
got
what
i
wanted
id
kick
the
hop
flavouring
up
big
time
here
and
lay
off
on
the
malt
a
bit
but
thats
just
me
not
bad
and
far
from
great
but
no
where
near
what
i
was
expecting
beer
poured
up
light
amber
to
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
nose
is
subtle
and
dry
this
beer
is
billed
as
an
ipa
but
im
not
really
getting
that
hop
flavor
is
very
subtle
the
after
taste
is
a
bit
stale
this
would
be
a
worthy
session
beer
but
not
much
more
than
something
to
pound
during
the
game
would
i
reccomend
this
for
25
a
case
probably
when
in
the
area
visit
cricket
hill
very
murky
looking
deep
golden
appearance
thin
bubbly
white
head
that
fails
to
leave
much
lace
the
aroma
seems
more
sweet
than
hoppy
to
me
sweet
bread
type
of
sweetness
a
little
doughy
on
the
nose
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
spicy
slighty
bitter
and
not
very
hoppy
at
all
sweet
doughy
tones
dominate
and
pepper
yeastiness
comes
into
play
as
well
decent
tasting
beverage
but
not
what
i
would
call
an
eipa
by
any
means
although
this
beer
is
proclaimed
as
an
english
style
ipa
it
could
just
as
easily
pass
as
an
american
pale
ale
its
slightly
hazy
goldenorange
body
is
capped
by
a
frothy
head
of
bright
white
and
bright
resinous
grassy
and
citrusy
hops
reminiscent
of
nugget
greet
you
in
the
nose
in
the
mouth
its
medium
bodied
with
a
median
carbonation
level
and
fine
bubbles
that
leave
it
smooth
and
gently
creamy
across
the
palate
the
flavor
is
as
might
be
suspected
given
the
hoppy
nose
its
resinous
grassy
floral
and
mildly
citrusy
hops
are
interwoven
throughout
a
blanket
of
bready
and
biscuity
malt
the
balance
is
impeccable
with
hop
and
malt
teetering
back
and
forth
over
a
solid
support
beam
of
bitterness
it
finishes
drying
as
a
wave
of
its
hopinfused
maltiness
receeds
to
reveal
the
few
sparkling
gems
of
hop
flavor
still
left
on
the
palate
quite
drinkable
nice
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
that
satisfies
good
carbonation
this
could
make
a
nice
session
brew
but
it
would
need
more
hoppiness
in
there

this

a
solid
golden

with

above

call
this
an
ipa
with
a
name

hopnotic
and
in
the

it
seems
to
be
a
felony
case
of
false
advertising
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
what
its
made
up
to
be
very
little

just
not

highly
drinkable

enjoyable
o
reminded
me
of
some
of
my
early
home
brews
very
drinkable
but
carbonation
wasnt
quite
right
and
taste
needed
something
although
it
doesnt
necessarily
have
a
character
of
its
own
it
is
a
wellexecuted
ipa
kind
of
mixing
english
and
american
styles
i
am
under
the
impression
they
boosted
its
hops
compared
to

versions

i
typically
dont
go
for
ipas
but
ill
try
this
one
again
if
it
ever
comes
in
my
beer
of
the
month
box
again
i
do
not
know
why
this
is
being
labeled
retired
unless
i
got
a
really
old
beer
from
my
beer
of
the
month
club
anyway
the
beer
poured
a
light
amber
color
with
a
tan
head
did
not
look
like
an
ipa
it
smelled
like
an
ipa
the
taste
was
not
ipa
either
but
more
of
a
heavy
lager
it
was
very
unipaish
but
i
liked
it
and
would
buy
again
of
course
if
it
is
still
available
that
is
overall
this
ipa
leans
towards
the
citrus
end
and
is
not
as
refreshing
as
some
others
out
there
decent
beer
but
nothing
overwhelming
dont
know
that
ive
ever
met
a
sea
dog
i
liked
o
this
beer
wsa
quite
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
but
i
would
not
likely
think
of
it
as
a
sessionable
beer
slightly
too
intense
in
the
hoppiness
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
sitting
o
i
doubt
if
i
ever
have
this
again
as
there
was
barely
anything
good
about
this
beer
overall
im
not
impressed
a
mediocre
offering
which
i
would
not
seek
out
an
ok
beer
all
around
but
nothing
spectacular
more
like
a
light
golden
ale
than
ipa
years
ago
i
was
a
fan
of
sea
dogs
old
east
ipa
but
i
think
the
shipyard
folks
have
wrecked
havoc
here
major
disappointment
avoid
o
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
at
all
in
fact
i
couldnt
even
finish
it
i
had
to
pour
half
of
it
out
what
a
waste
overall
average
pale
ale
barely
ipa
almost
all
bittering
hops
no
real
floral
citrus
or
tropical
fruit
some
malt
balance
but
this
is
more
like
a
best
bitter
than
ipa
overall
this
beer
does
very
well
on
the
cask
a
decent
ipa
and
very
drinkable
poured
ontap
at
the
sea
dog
in
south
portland
the
beer
was
served
in
a
pint
glass
and
it
presents
a
caramel
brown
color
that
is
crisp
and
vibrant
no
head
on
this
beer
the
aromas
are
a
blend
of
coffee
nut
and
caramel
overall
rich
and
sweet
the
flavors
are
rich
sweet
caramel
malt
with
a
strong
deep
hop
presence
in
the
foundation
very
smooth
and
round
the
aftertaste
is
rich
and
sweet
with
a
heavier
hop
presence
both
moist
green
and
slightly
spiced
the
beer
has
a
dry
clean
finish
not
too
shabby
d
nicely
done
and
appropriate
to
the
style
the
cask
conditioning
was
a
nice
touch
o
blah
skip
the
taste
is
mildly
hoppy
no
big
deal
it
has
some
hops
up
front
with
a
slight
caramellike
flavor
which
starts
to
take
over
with
a
slight
cloying
effect
which
makes
it
pretty
average
as
far
as
flavor
almost
as
if
the
yeast
gave
up
34
of
the
way
and
left
the
residual
sugar
there
and
this
doesnt
bother
that
much
because
it
tastes
ok
but
it
does
distract
from
the
hops
that
are
apparently
there
just
muted
by
the
malt
overall
bottom
line
is
this
is
a
pretty
poor
ipa
english
or
otherwise
it
just
lacks
an
assertive
hop
flavor
and
the
bitterness
it
does
have
is
negated
by
the
overtly
sweet
malt
finish
caramel
is
too
high
i
recommend
trying
anything
else
but
this
if
you
are
looking
for
a
decent
ipa
the
hops
take
a
backseat
which
is
dissapointing
copper
colored
brew
largely
clear
but
with
a
bit

small
white

kinda
has
a
unique
taste
to
the
water
too
not
to
say
that
its
watery
just
that
its
a
individually
noticed
ingredient
for
some
reason
mouth
is
pretty
full
and
smooth
kind
of
a
unique
brew
in
its
own
regard
not
too
bad
o
great
nose
but
just
not
quite
balanced
in
the

grassy

still
a
worthy
beer
probably
great
with
burgers
and
similar
doing
fine
with
some
hotpepper

crackers
at
the

that
was
last
night
tonight
its
doing
not

badly
with

not
at

what
i
was

id
say
im
pleasantly
surprised
the
next
time
i
hear
someone
say
i
dont
like
ipas
i
know
what
beer
im
handing
them
this
is

good

really
dont
want
to
dislike
this
brewery
because
i
love
my
maine
roots
due
to
being

it
has
slightly

you

i
must
ask
where
are
the

im
enjoying
this

i
think
that
is
a
result
of
the

beeing
too

the

was

the

was

overall

slightly

not

and

the
absolute
epitome
of
mediocrity
although
i
have
come
to
expect
this
from
shipyard
as
of
late
the
only
thing
unique
about
their
line
of
ipas
is
that
their
is
an
apple
pear
quality
in
some
of
them
that
hits
the
right
note
sometimes
very
very
very
subtle
my
mind
making
up
for
better
days
with
the
brew
not
bad
but
not
going
to
grab
except
in
a
pinch
smell
was
dreadful
only
tasted
slightly
better
disappointing
its
really
bitter
not
a
fan
of

solid

good
ipa
not
as
bold
and
hippy
as
west
coast
ipas
but
has
some
solid
malt
and
caramel
tastes
very
refreshing
for
an
ipa
if
youve
been
drinking
a
lot
of
hopper
beers
due
to
how
it
carries
the
hops

love
this

and
eventually
drinkable

ipa
the
hops
veering
towards
perfume
territory
rather
than
citrus
orchards
having
sex
with
pine
forests
simple
as
that
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
an
example
of
this
style
made
stateside
for
me
this
is
a
better
example
of
an
english
ipa
than
their
monkey
fist
is
of
an
american
ipa
herbal
grassy
hops
over
a
medium
malt
and
fruity
yeast
base
it
doesnt
come
together
amazingly
but
nothing
glaring
is
wrong
here
poured
a
nice
dark
tan
color
with
a
good
head
that
lingered
awhile
aroma
was
light
but
did
catch
abit
of
malty
hops
smell
taste
was
good
with
malt
up
front
and
a
decent
hop
finish
wanted
a
little
more
from
this
beer
it
was
a
little
laid
back
there
was
a
little
citrus
that
came
through
overall
excellent
balance
but
not
enough
of
the
hops
came
through
for
me
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
light
brownishtan
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
kind
of
mild
a
bit
of
malts
taste
is
also
light
for
the
style
malts
up
front
hops
at
the
finish
some
caramel
and
just
a
bit
dry
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
drinkable
and
decent
but
nothing
special
i
was
non
to
pleased
with
this
beer
considering
all
the
hype
it
has
received
the
stale
red
apple
finish
is
really
just
ruins
the
beer
and
makes
me
not
want
to
take
another
sip
part
of
the
issue
may
very
well
be
that
this
beer
is
2
years
beyond
its
best
if
enjoyed
by
date
ill
give
a
fresher
bottle
a
go
in
the
near
future
however
after
looking
at
other
reviews
it
seems
my
assessment
is
inline
with
what
other
observed
i
like
this
beer
as
a
session
brew
but
im
not
sure
its
a
traditional
ipa
by
british
or
american
standards
overall
one
of
the
better
straightup
ipas
ive
had
would
drink
again
hits
all
the
right
notes
this
is
definitely
a
traditional
english
ipa
dont
expect
a
kick
ass
hoppy
american
ipa
though
interestingly
its
hops
intensity
seems
to
increase
over
time
rather
than
the
opposite
also
one
can
learn
how
to
easily
identify
fuggles
hops
oits
not
a
terrible
beer
in
and
of
itself
but
it
falls
copmletely
short
as
an
ipa
o
i
am
a
bit
surprised
by
the
low
ratings
as
an
english
ipa
it
holds
up
ok
for
me
drinkable
and
the
right
abv
medium
bodied
the
alcohol
hidden
nicely
and
overall
a
fine
easy
to
drink
ipa
a
warm
grainy
englishstyle
ipa
with
a
subtle
hop
bitterness
adding
balance
to
the
whole
tasting
experience
certainly
not
a
west
coast
hop
aroma
bomb
but
delivering
on
the
malt
character
and
hop
bitterness
o
maybe
a
few
too
many
ibus
ok
but
slightly
lacking
what
a
really
good
beer
needs
definitely
more
english
than
american
in
style
but
a
decent
easy
going
session
beer
that
whilst
not
setting
the
world
alight
is
still
a
good
solid
effort
from
the
shipyard
brewery
good
session
brew
not
awful
i
would
have
it
again
but
if
i
had
other
options
unfortunately
i
dont
hahaha
i
would
go
with
an
alternative
probably
would
never
buy
this
one
again
taste
is
hoppy
but
very
mild
brewed
with
fuggles
hops
this
is
an
englishstyle
ipa
and
would
easily
pass
for
an
american
pale
ale
certainly
not
in
the
bigger
hopbombstyle
of
most
modern
american
ipas
though
easily
sessionworthy
but
definitely
a
disappointment
for
an
ipa
nowadays

served
from
the
bottle
and
poured
into
a
standard
shaker
glass
the
beer
pours
with
a
good
12cm
of
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
and
leaves
very
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
the
color
is
a
pale
amber
color
that
reminds
me
of
some
cheap
sunbleached
orange
fabric
the
light
penetration
is
pretty
good
with
some
mild
chill
haze
that
clears
as
the
beer
warms
a
little
bit
the
nose
comes
right
out
and
introduces
itself
as
a
big
glass
of
fuggles
it
really
is
like
opening
a
package
of
fuggles
hop
pellets
it
is
very
earthy
and
very
vegatal
like
a
freshly
dug
carrot
or
radish
it
wasnt
an
unpleasant
smell
at
all
there
was
also
some
mild
sweet
caramel
to
the
background
as
well
but
the
fuggles
were
all
over
it
the
tast
was
again
very
earthy
and
vegetal
but
more
like
zucchini
bread
than
the
aforementioned
carrots
and
radishes
the
bitterness
was
smooth
and
easy
mouthfeel
was
superdry
and
fairly
bitter
maybe
a
little
too
far
on
the
dry
scale
as
far
as
an
ipa
goes
this
is
very
british
given
the
excusive
use
of
the
fuggles
hops
i
really
enjoy
the
single
hopped
beer
concept
and
this
ipa
really
does
give
you
a
full
dose
of
fuggles
so
that
i
will
always
be
able
to
find
it
in
a
beer
that
said
the
vegetal
side
of
this
hops
really
needs
something
with
it
to
cool
it
off
beer
pours
a
golden
amber
small
head
dissipating
quickly
not
a
whole
lot
of
lacing
going
on
in
the
glass
as
you
drink
smell
is
a
light
toasted
malt
with
some
citrus
with
a
small
metallic
note
initial
taste
is
a
mildly
bitter
citrus
fairly
thin
generic
ipa
nothing
to
write
home
about
actually
grabbed
this
one
in
montreal
where
they
dont
seem
to
know
what
ipa
is
so
it
was
a
pleasant
change
of
pace
from
the
choices
of
blonderedstout
there
taste
this
beer
tastes
more
like
a
strongly
hopped
lager
than
an
ipa
mild
malt
with
some
vanilla
and
then
the
fuggles
coming
forward
the
hop
is
strong
at
the
beginning
fades
and
then
comes
back
at
the
end
i
found
the
finish
better
than
the
rest
probably
because
of
the
lingering
hop
id
have
it
again
on
draught
overall
nothing
special
i
have
had
better
english
ipas
and
would
go
another
direction
next
time
rjt
overall
immediately
suggests
british
ale
on
first
sip
and
confirmed
by
mention
of
fuggles
hops
on
the
label
this
is
far
from
the
aggressiveness
of
the
bitter
citrusy
hops
of
american
ipas
its
more
mellow
more
drinkable
more
approachable
its
not
that
exciting
as
beers
go
i
do
like
the
aggressiveness
of
american
ipas
but
its
drinkable
and
pleasant
and
worth
a
look
would
be
a
great
session
beer
poured
an
overcarbonated
5
inch
head
with
an
orangery
amber
color
faint
hop
accented
aroma
decent
malt
hop
balanced
flavor
with
a
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
body
was
a
bit
thin
for
an
ipa
this
was
a
very
average
ipa
that
was
drinkable
but
nothing
to
merit
a
repeat
purchase
o
this
one
just
seemed
to
be
a
little
off
balanced
some
if
the
flavors
didnt
quite
mesh
and
seemed
off
the
road
of
a
traditional
ipa
pours
medium
dark

foam
smells
of

pine

full
malty
juicy

with
a
pine
minty

rind
bitter
remains
decent
mixed
bitter
alternatively
mellow
and
firm
good
overall
not
my
favorite
ipa
but
the
first
few
drinks
were
very
nice
i
would
recommend
this
to
people
who
arent
too
much
of
ipa
snobs
and
who
like
a
quality
beer
at
a
decent
price
b
good
stuff
overall
im
not
an
ipa
expert
heck
im
not
an
expert
on
anything
but
from
an
ipa
newb
this
one
is
different
from
most
that
i
have
tried
the
grapefruit
taste
and
smell
isnt
there
not
overly
spicy
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
would
be
perfect
for
me
for
having
while
slaving
over
the
grill
on
the
back
patio
during
a
hot
summer
day
o
decent
ipa
not
my
favorite
hoppy
beer
fuggle
hops
alone
just
dont
cut
it
for
me
meh
distinctly
underwhelming
where
are
the
aromatic
hops
its
just
dry
yeast
and
stewed
herbs
it
accurately
captures
the
essence
of
certain
english
ipas
namely
the
mediocre
kind
pumped
out
by
the
larger
breweries
i
suppose
using
only
fuggles
in
the
brew
doesnt
yield
much
character
this
might
well
be
the
worst
americanbrewed
ipa
ive
tried
to
date
give
it
a
miss
overall
i
probably
wont
try
this
again
but
if
you
want
to
try
a
ipa
for
the
first
time
i
would
go
with
this
one
this
is
a
decent
interpretation
of
the
english
ipa
style
the
fuggle
hops
are
ever
present
and
lend
a
nice
balance
to
the
malt
character
its
not
offensive
and
its
easy
to
drink
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
in
the
future
this
fairly
average
brew
is
something
i
do
not
need
to
try
again

is
biscuit
pine
grapefruit
and
the
signature
ring
wood
yeast
taste
is
all
of
that
very
malty
for
my
liking
and
why
do
they
always
use
that

they
make
the

medium
plenty

not

fans
ideal
this
makes
poor
ipas
ive
had
in
the
past
taste
like
hopslam
reguardless
of
it
being
english
or
not
it
just
doesnt
do
it
this
is
possibly
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
definitely
the
worst
score
ive
given
on
ba
i
dont
feel
like
this
should
be
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
but
its
making
a
run
for
the
title
its
far
from
offensive
but
its
a
huge
slap
in
the
face
to
the
ipa
style
pass
on
this
if
youre
ever
considering
giving
it
a
shot
this
is
exactly
why
i
buy
singles
o
malty
for
an
ipa
pine
bitter
hops
balanced
well
would
buy
again
bot
not
for
a
true
hop
head
craving
moreys
bottom
line
id
probably
drink
it
again
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
pay
for
it
if
im
hankering
for
an
english
ipa
ill
be
reaching
for
a
yards
ipa
or
even
sam
smiths
overall
4
55
a
good
brew
i
noticed
the
label
says
fuggles
and
i
found
out
to
be
a
create
exercise
in
hop
flavor
exploration
o
perhaps
better
to
think
of
this
as
a
maltrich
apa
a
good
entrylevel
ipa
for
those
intimidated
or
adverse
to
hoppy
brews
light
to
medium
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
ive
had
other
english
ipas
that
i
liked
but
this
one
is
not
one
of
them
o
is
a
good
beer
not
a
very
good
ipa
overall
but
it
tastes
as
though
its
on
the
right
track
in
coming
years
i
hope
the
brewery
reformulates
it
to
bring
it
to
its
full
potential
o
a
really
simple
and
short
ipa
wouldnt
buy
again
o
good
english
ipa
o
im
not
sure
of
the
last
time
i
had
an
english
ipa
but
maybe
im
just
not
a
fan
of
this
style
this
was
just
a
brew
that
i
could
not
get
into
the
floralperfume
aromaflavor
didnt
pair
well
the
distinct
diacetyl
presence
i
might
give
this
beer
another
try
way
down
the
road
but
im
going
to
look
to
other
proven
brews
in
the
meantime
o
good
for
the
style
only
decent
to
me
this
is
a
pretty
good
looking
pour
with
a
light
thin
coated
lace
that
also
rolls
down
the
glass
the
scent
is
non
existent
although
better
than
any
of
those
green
bottled
imports
just
cant
pick
up
much
on
the
nose
a
bit
thin
with
a
pretty
smooth
mouth
feel
and
an
easy
to
drink
taste
not
sure
this
should
qualify
as
an
english
ipa
not
all
that
bitter
a
bit
over
carbonated
also
some
toffee
like
spiciness
and
a
nice
golden
color
on
the
pour
not
the
best
of
micro
brews
although
not
hard
to
digest
poured
a
nice
clear
golden
color
i
really
couldnt
get
much
of
anything
from
the
aroma
just
kind
of
a
blank
slate
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
upfront
that
melds
into
a
sharp
bitterness
on
the
back
end
the
beer
sits
on
the
tongue
a
little
longer
than
youd
expect
nothing
special
but
id
have
it
again
overall
great
flavors
good
mouth
presence
a
solid
english
styple
ipa
overall
pretty
malty
for
an
ipa
the
limited
floral
and
bitterness
seem
to
prevent
a
complexity
that
might
otherwise
be
welcome
o
in
my
opinion
great
appearance
and
smell
but
unbalanced
and
boozy
flavor
overall
i
would
not
recommend
it
the
taste
is
a
mix
of
bitter
fuggles
sweet
malts
and
of
corse
ringwood
the
taste
is
much
flatter
the
i
remember
a
decent
english
ipa
well
rounder
but
noticably
better
on
draft
o
3
5
pours
gold
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
nice
thick
pillowy
white
head
mild
hop
aroma
grassy
but
nothing
more
tastes
rather
one
dimensional
malt
and
caramel
mild
bitterness
clean
finish
body
is
medium
and
finishes
dry
and
crisp
on
the
palate
simple
o
shipyard
ipa
isnt
earth
shattering
but
it
is
a
solid
enjoyable
beer
id
drink
it
again
overall
i
was
expecting
not
to
care
for
this
beer
not
being
a
fan
of
the
brewerys
other
offerings
but
this
beer
surprised
me
and
i
actually
enjoyed
the
interpretation
of
the
eipa
style
o
overall
id
still
call
it
an
interesting
beer
since
for
some
reason
i
cant
completely
fit
it
into
neither
american
nor
english
ipa
style
it
tastes
more
like
the
latter
yet
feels
like
the
former
minus
the
aromatic
hop
profile
all
and
all
id
love
to
get
some
more
of
this
conclusion
far
and
away
the
most
englishstyle
ipa
ive
ever
had
im
thinking
that
maybe
thats
why
the
ratings
on
here
arent
very
good
as
we
yanks
have
been
brought
up
on
the
american
chop
variety
i
dont
love
this
but
its
really
interesting
and
definitely
something
nice
for
a
change
i
think
i
will
brew
that
fuggles
best
bitter
o
overall
it
isnt
a
good
beer
plain
and
simple
average
is
the
best
i
can
call
it
but
it
doesnt
excite
or
interest
me
in
any
way
no
aspect
of
this
beer
is
worth
noting
and
it
is
not
worth
trying
in
any
way
it
isnt
actively
bad
its
just
a
waste
of
time
and
money
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
short
lived
white
head
aroma
of
caramel
malt
with
some
citrus
floral
hops
and
some
light
fruitiness
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
some
good
hops
and
light
fruity
taste
palate
is
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
finish
is
sweet
maltiness
with
some
good
citrusy
floral
hops
to
add
balance
overall
not
overally
bitter
and
the
aroma
seems
to
dissipate
quickly
not
my
favorite
but
a
modestly
good
drinkable
ipa
o
unique
but
not
the
type
of
ipa
that
made
me
a
ipa
lover
still
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
understand
the
fuggles
hop
traits
my
second
taste
isnt
much
better
i
like
the
aftertaste
enough
and
the
fact
that
the
hops
sit
on
the
tongue
to
want
to
rush
through
the
beer
and
swallow
as
fast
as
i
can
the
aftertaste
is
worth
buying
a
bottle
of
this
brew
not
sure
if
i
have
had
a
fuggle
beer
before
but
i
have
never
had
a
beer
that
tasted
like
this
not
an
ipa
anyway
its
not
bad
but
its
not
good
either
its
its
just
okay
portrayal
of
the
style
inexpensive
too
overall
i
am
not
really
sure
about
this
one
think
i
am
used
to
american
ipas
for
a
good
reason
english
ones
do
seem
weaker
and
lighter
just
like
the
description
would
only
drink
if
there
nothing
else
available
still
plenty
of
other
good
maine
beers
to
sample
o
for
my
personal
taste
i
was
not
impressed
by
this
beer
as
a
home
brewer
though
i
did
enjoy
the
abundance
and
clarity
of
the
fuggle
hops
in
this
brew
if
i
have
a
desire
for
fuggle
ill
come
right
to
this
one
needless
to
say
i
do
not
recommend
this
beer
i
wont
list
the
categories
because
every
one
i
rated
the
same
awful
o
nothing
special
or
poor
about
this
ipa
o
not
a
fan
of
this
brew
it
has
a
unique
taste
from
the
fuggles
hops
i
suppose
but
not
a
flavor
i
appreciate
overall
i
would
avoid
there
are
much
better
ipas
out
there
that
actually
smell
and
taste
like
ipas
o
this
beer
fits
the
description
of
an
english
ipa
i
was
on
the
hunt
for
an
american
the
malt
definitely
hides
some
of
the
hops
quality
maybe
a
good
start
for
those
who
might
find
the
hops
to
overpowering
in
the
american
ipas
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
prefer
the
dry
hop
citrus
bite
of
the
american
ipas
overall
as
much
as
i
like
ipa
i
must
say
that
i
dont
really
care
for
this
there
is
something
to
be
desired
im
not
sure
what
it
is
oh
well
go
buy
yourself
a
sixer
of
this
and
see
for
yourself
drink
i
just
didnt
like
it
it
was
malty
to
the
max
and
lost
its
ipa
essences
oh
well
it
was
only
1
50
moving
on
o
well
i
tried
this
because
it
is
one
of
the
very
rare
american
craft
beer
to
make
it
on
the
shelves
here
in
quebec
i
would
not
suggest
this
beer
it
smelled
good
but
tasted
pretty
bad
overall
if
youre
a
fan
of
english
ipas
dont
over
look
this
beer
its
got
a
decent
maltycaramel
taste
and
is
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
over
the
course
of
a
night
not
as
bitter
as
most
ipas
so
keeping
this
in
mind
pour
it
into
a
glass
and
give
it
a
shot
poured
out
of
the
bottle
a
goldencopper
very
bubbly
with
a
frothy
head
the
nose
is
lightly
toasted
pale
malts
with
a
more
powerful
amount
of
earthy
hops
the
taste
has
a
solid
malt
body
but
not
too
complex
the
hops
dominate
over
the
malts
and
leave
a
bitter
and
biting
aftertaste
of
earthyfloral
resins
hops
and
malts
not
balanced
well
here
id
buy
it
again
especially
if
it
was
localcheaper
overall
its
ok
would
i
try
it
again
sure
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
after
taking
a
sip
of
this
i
had
to
check
the
bottle
again
to
make
sure
that
i
had
grabbed
the
right
bottle
simply
put
this
doesnt
strike
me
as
an
ipa
the
hops
were
almost
nonexistent
on
both
the
nose
and
in
the
taste
this
isnt
to
say
that
it
was
a
terrible
beer
it
just
wasnt
any
sort
of
ipa
that
im
familiar
with
notes
overall
easy
drinking
and
balanced
make
for
a
nice
basic
english
india
pale
ale
overall
its
simply
a
boring
beer
theres
nothing
thats
offputting
its
just
rather
ordinary
brew
d
not
terribly
drinkable
but
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
overall
this
is
a
pretty
mediocre
beer
not
bad
not
great
better
out
there
for
around
the
same
price
even
in
the
same
style
but
if
this
is
all
thats
available
its
worth
drinking
d
not
bad
but
not
very
hoppy
for
an
ipa
and
a
little
forgettable
d
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
drinkable
american
ipas
ive
had
while
its
not
as
hoppy
or
as
true
to
the
style
as
others
it
is
a
pleasing
beer
drinking
experience
all
around
a
good
tasting
a
sessionable
beer
d
overall
this
reminds
me
of
a
generic
macro
lager
more
than
a
craft
ipa
its
uninspiring
and
rather
unappealing
to
be
honest
d
i
had
no
problem
finishing
this
beer
and
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
pours
a
clear
orangish
copper
color
with
a
two
finger
stark
white
head
which
gives
way
to
a
decent
lace
the
aroma
is
of
floral
hops
a
garden
like
smell
but
the
smell
is
a
little
faint
the
taste
is
a
little
weak
there
is
a
floral
hop
presence
but
it
is
a
little
off
there
is
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
to
balance
out
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
but
thin
and
slightly
watery
the
dirnkability
is
okay
it
is
an
easy
drink
and
goes
down
smooth
but
there
is
nothing
to
really
make
you
want
another
taste
is
a
mild
bread
with
a
very
watery
and
sharp
alcohol
and
not
so
much
hop
like
tinge
somewhat
chemical
like
finish
not
too
excited
about
this
one
i
could
pass
this
one
up
for
something
else
d
nice
drinker
unexpectedly
refreshing
worth
a
try
came
across
this
in
muskogee
ok
of
all
places
d
not

wouldnt
buy
again

a

not
a

it
is
pretty
light
in
body
not
a
complex
or
lasting
flavor
expected
more
flavor
and
aroma
for
something
in
the
ipa
category
a
slight
let
down
but
understandable
using
a
fuggles
but
still
overall
pretty
drinkable
nothing
special
i
dont
intend
to
have
this
again
not
good
drinkability

while
biscuit

provide
a
good

more
so
as
the
beer
warms
up
long
hoppy
finish
overall
very
good
ipa
the
appearance
of
this
ipa
was
very
lackluster
it
did
have
some
orangey
color
with
a
bit
of
lining
around
the
glass
as
you
drank
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
some
what
caramel
with
a
bit
of
florida
oranges
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
nothing
special
although
i
did
get
a
hint
of
nectarines
the
mouthfeel
of
this
ipa
was
nothing
to
brag
about
it
although
it
was
a
very
filling
taste
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
was
not
great
but
for
me
i
think
it
is
a
great
social
beer
thought
initially
i
was
just
getting
old
beer
now
that
they
put
the
freshness
date
on
the
beer
i
know
the
beer
is
just
that
way
d
i
dont
know
if
this
is
past
its
date
but
i
do
not
want
to
finish
what
i
have
very
disappointed
d
pretty
drinkable
i
wont
have
any
problem
polishing
off
a
few
of
these
drinks
i
see
what
they
were
trying
to
do
with
this
one
but
its
not
my
cup
of
tea
its
drinkable
just
not
memorable
eh
drinks
ok
nothing
repulsive
but
it
seems
like
its
missing
something
the
beer
is
drinkable
ive
certainly
had
a
few
bottle
sin
a
single
evening
on
a
per
glass
basis
im
not
rushing
back
for
a
second
sip
but
im
also
not
going
to
spend
a
long
time
with
each
glass
this
is
a
good
beer
that
wont
distract
you
very
much
nor
will
it
hurt
you
too
much
when
you
discover
youve
made
most
of
your
way
through
the
six
pack
d
this
was
a
weak
ipa
and
to
be
honest
i
dont
want
to
try
this
again
thats
a
bad
thing
cause
i
have
2
left
in
the
fridge
shipyard
should
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
with
this
one
dehh
easy
to
drink
but
not
enjoyable
to
drink
d
i
struggled
very
badly
with
this
one
i
dont
think
ill
ever
try
this
one
again
two
fingers
white
head
over
a
nice
looking
amber
malty
and
fruity
aromas
a
little
bit
of
toasted
biscuit
and
grains
as
well
very
balanced
on
the
nose
flavors
are
a
lot
more
malty
than
this
nose
really
anticipates
toasted
and
bready
but
also
fruity
high
carbonation
with
a
nice
sticky
mouthfeel
d
a
more
quaffable
ipa
that
can
be
paired
with
almost
any
kinda
food
like
a
nice
pulled
pork
sandwich
this
is
one
i
would
order
on
tap
somewhere
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
a
good
ipa
and
certainly
worth
a
try
cheers
d
moderately
drinkable
not
a
good
ipa
it
seems
to
have
an
off
flavor
to
me
or
maybe
its
just
the
variety
of
hops
i
dont
like
it
seems
a
bit
murky
as
well
not
interested
in
this
beer
drinkable
but
not
my
first
choice
adequately
carbonated
and
pretty
drinkable
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
one
but
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
not
as
good
as
lh
400
monkey
but
it
was
a
good
english
ipa
d
very
balanced
and
pretty
drinkable
for
what
it
is
a
shot
at
a
decent
english
ipa
theres
just
not
enough
flavor
to
invest
the
time
and
interest
in
would
probably
suit
as
a
bbq
cleanser
or
a
hot
weather
lawnmower
brew
but
ill
leave
it
on
the
shelf
for
the
uninitiated
ipa
seeker
something
missing
on
this
one
has
the
malty
notes
but
no
hop
character
whatsoever
this
is
advertised
as
an
all
fuggle
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
this
is
so
much
a
good
thing
because
it
has
a
series
imbalance
taste
is
actually
quite
good
its
sweet
an
bitter
and
it
keeps
the
floral
hop
notes
as
well
it
has
that
standard
shipyard
taste
house
yeast
which
is
ok
overall
a
pretty
easy
drinking
and
approchable
ipa
md
pretty
drinkable
but
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
slimy
a
serviceable
but
boring
ipa
im
never
going
to
prefer
englishstyle
ipas
to
american
but
this
is
pretty
blah
from
any
perspective
it
looks
fine
deep
amber
body
with
a
foamy
white
head
unfortunately
it
goes
right
downhill
when
you
smell
it
theres
an
almost
cloyingly
sweet
medicinal
note
that
really
spoils
things
for
me
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
their
yeast
the
fuggles
are
musty
mineralish
and
floral
theres
a
fair
bit
of
butterscotch
malt
as
well
the
flavor
has
good
bitterness
but
the
hops
are
rather
bland
theres
a
metallic
tinge
to
the
odd
toffeebutterscotch
malt
this
beer
combines
some
things
that
i
dont
much
like
namely
ringwood
yeast
and
fuggles
its
not
terribly
hard
to
drink
but
theres
very
little
to
recommend
it
particularly
over
other
ipas

no

drinkability
for
an
ipa
not

for
an
eipa
this
one
missed
the
mark
for
me
too
much
dryness
too
much
of
being
like
an
american
ipa
overall
this
was
a
moderately
good
ipa
but
as
mentioned
the
unbalanced
nature
takes
away
from
the
overall
experience
drinkability
is
decent
but
the
bitterness
and
malt
bring
it
down
pours
a
hazy
copperamber
color
minimal

with

the

re

british
pale

i
think
its
the
wheat
and
especially
the

are
driving
this
a

the

direction

it

me
dthis
is
easily
drinkable
as
the
flavors
are
very
mild
with
a
very
inviting
texture
not
the
tastiest
beer
but
definitely
something
that
can
go
down
smooth
overall
this
isnt
very
good
its
not
offending
to
the
palate
its
just
not
tasty
they
need
to
amp
up
the
hop
content
of
this
beer
thats
for
sure
try
a
different
ipa
id
leave
this
one
alone
overall
a
nice
drinkable
ipa
of
the
english
variety
ill
have
this
one
again
carbonation
abound
that
was
the
brunt
of
the
feel
the
body
wasnt
watery
which
was
a
plus
it
was
never
bad
or
offensive
it
just
lacked
er
goodness
value
shipyard
brews
are
fairly
lowpriced
so
who
can
complain
really
decent
brew
for
a
football
game
or
something
d
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
boring
one
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
overall
carbonation
is
fairly
high
but
not
excessive
im
not
sure
id
have
this
beer
again
theres
nothing
unpleasant
but
nothing
that
stands
out
in
any
way
i
prefer
american
ipas
to
british
ones
overall
but
even
when
im
in
a
british
mood
i
can
find
something
far
superior
drinkability
coming
off
dogfish
head
90m
the
other
night
this
had
a
hard
sell
i
feel
that
this
is
a
pretty
standard
ipa
not
as
good
as
harpoon
ill
finish
the
six
pack
and
probably
never
visit
this
beer
again
after
several
recent
back
to
back
ipa
comparisons
i
have
to
say
that
im
not
overly
impressed
with
shipyards
ipa
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
really
doesnt
stand
out
from
the
ipas
ive
tried
from
stone
lagunitas
dogfish
head
smuttynose
and
anderson
valley
among
others
it
has
a
decent
amount
of
hop
bitterness
but
the
taste
doesnt
pack
a
powerful
punch
and
the
finish
is
pretty
weak
in
comparison
to
some
of
the
others
i
would
drink
shipyard
again
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
d
ill
drink
the
sixer
that
i
bought
but
not
sure
i
would
pick
this
up
again
left
my
mouth
dry
afterward
however
it
did
go
down
pretty
nice
it
should
also
be
known
that
im
not
a
much
of
a
hophead
poured
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
of
410
into
a
shaker
pint
on
11309
nice
two
finger
head
recedes
to
leave
a
thin
white
curtain
over
the
top
of
the
light
bright
copper
body
highly
carbonated
the
smell
is
of
some
lighter
malt
very
subtle
herbal
hops
buttery
diacetyl
a
little
lacking
in
my
opinion
the
taste
is
definately
a
maltier
ipa
as
is
more
common
in
the
english
style
some
herbal
hops
in
the
background
though
i
really
had
to
reach
to
pull
this
out
some
decent
bittering
and
some
bubblegumcaramel
sweetness
again
from
the
diacetyl
this
was
mediumlight
bodied
and
a
little
overcarbed
for
me
this
one
did
not
do
it
for
me
i
know
that
it
is
an
english
ipa
but
i
still
had
to
work
to
hard
to
appreciate
the
hop
profile
and
maybe
a
tad
too
buttery
for
my
taste
tried
this
beer
in
searsport
and
it
was
enjoyable
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
draft
pour
was
good
and
held
a
thin
head
but
only
long
enough
to
catch
a
glance
once
the
server
set
it
down
the
light
ambergold
color
was
pleasing
but
did
not
seem
dark
enough
to
have
a
full
bodied
flavor
profile
body
of
the
beer
seemed
to
lack
fullness
and
the
hop
profile
was
nonexistent
for
an
ipa
as
i
try
more
american
ipas
from
new
england
this
seems
to
be
common
among
the
local
brewers
having
such
mild
characteristics
makes
this
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
light
body
and
only
mild
carbonation
not
a
beer
i
would
try
again
with
so
many
better
options
in
this
style
thankfully
things
get
a
bit
more
aggressive
in
the
mouth
although
for
my
taste
this
is
way
too
tame
to
merit
repeat
business
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
fine
carbonation
building
a
fluffiness
from
the
mediumthick
body
joining
the
grassiness
is
some
lemon
rind
hints
of
black
pepper
and
woodiness
and
a
slightly
odd
saltwater
taffy
flavor
shipyard
ipa
is
a
hazy
golden
ale
with
a
dense
bubby
off
white
head
that
has
excellent
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
grassy
with
notes
of
crackers
and
black
pepper
there
is
note
thats
almost
smokey
or
ashy
and
a
whiff
of
wet
earth
its
medium
bodied
soft
smooth
and
creamy
the
finish
is
clean
its
good
and
bitter
and
the
malt
balances
it
out
well
its
fruity
resiny
and
grassy
the
aftertaste
is
of
juniper
and
black
pepper
its
so
english
and
so
sessionable
pours
an
orangeyamber
tone
with
minimal
lacing
very
nice
nose
with
the
classic
ipa
maltiness
fullhouse
with
a
touch
of
hop
floral
notes
this
is
a
really
interesting
take
on
the
english
ipa
the
massive
maltiness
is
beefed
up
even
more
with
the
hops
keeping
things
mysterious
none
of
the
citrusy
aspects
come
through
but
there
is
a
definite
bittersweetness
that
is
delivered
the
perfect
mouthfeel
makes
for
a
lusciousness
and
thus
very
drinkable
not
thin
at
all
another
session
beer
for
sure
decent
mouthfeel
after
the
first
pour
which
was
overcarbonated
it
flattened
out
a
bit
and
didnt
get
in
the
way
still
could
use
a
shot
though
interesting
flavors
and
definitely
a
unique
take
on
the
english
bitter
style
but
to
me
this
doesnt
quite
qualify
even
on
the
bipa
scale
mouthfeel
is
okay
thin
and
highly
carbonated
very
dry
finish
the
beer
is
copper
color
slightly
veiled
the
head
is
good
looking
cloudy
and
stick
wells
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
caramel
with
a
timid
presence
of
hops
in
the
taste
i
get
the
caramel
which
is
followed
by
hops
bitterness
the
taste
lingers
in
the
mouth
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
this
is
easy
to
drink
a
daytoday
ipa
in
my
opinion
this
is
english
ipa
not
american
ipa
even
though
it
is
brewed
by
americans
can
be
consumed
in
mass
quantities
great
dinner
beer
md
similar
to
the
export
ale
in
flavor
this
one
boasts
a
slightly
more
developed
hop
profile
drinks
easy
certainly
sessionable
especially
for
those
who
arent
really
into
ipas
as
i
find
the
hops
to
be
tame
appearance
was
golden
orange
with
decent
finger
and
a
half
head
decent
lacing
the
smell
was
off
a
bit
more
towards
a
fruity
dirt
smell
it
tased
really
strange
too
not
like
any
ipa
ive
ever
tasted
before
it
was
like
a
malty
fruity
off
taste
with
a
presence
of
odd
hops
i
wasnt
enjoying
this
at
all
mouthfeel
was
decent
not
too
watery
or
over
carbonated
drinkability
wasnt
there
at
all
it
was
just
an
awkward
beer
not
bad
but
not
a
brew
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
is
not
a
good
beer
at
all
though
the
mouthfeel
is
okay
this
is
drinkable
beer
poured
orange
with
a
nice
white
head
nose
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
hop
flowers
taste
is
fairly
well
balanced
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
blending
with
a
mild
bready
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
lively
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
pretty
good
not
a
bad
beer
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
d
easy
to
drink
nothing
outstanding
here
i
could
drink
several
of
them
but
i
probably
wont
buy
this
one
for
a
while
ill
try
a
few
more
ipas
to
see
how
this
one
stacks
up
overall
the
mouthfeel
of
this
is
good
it
has
some
slight
drying
properties
that
go
interestingly
well
with
the
buttery
diacetyl
feel
and
combine
tercially
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
for
a
really
refreshing
drink
sessionable
for
any
fan
of
the
hop
d
reasonably
drinkable
with
convincing
english
character
but
the
malt
is
muddy
and
heavy
a
decent
english
ipa
but
not
really
one
worth
coming
back
to
good
but
forgettable
i
got
this
thinking
it
was
a
ipa
but
got
a
nice
surprise
im
not
a
big
ipa
fan
but
im
trying
to
learn
to
love
it
im
finding
english
ipa
is
more
up
my
alley
its
a
decent
brew
ill
keep
an
eye
out
for
this
one
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
ambertinged
gold
with
some
chill
haze
and
a
modest
lightbeige
head
that
quickly
dwindles
to
a
nebulous
froth
smells
like
an
esb
not
an
ipa
earthy
bready
english
malts
and
no
hops
to
be
found
anywhere
flavor
is
much
the
same
tastes
like
shipyard
spiced
this
beer
with
bark
and
random
leaves
instead
of
hops
solid
bitterness
and
decent
malt
presence
but
no
appreciable
hop
flavor
tannic
and
dry
finish
overcarbonated
what
on
earth
were
they
thinking
bottle
poured
a
clear
bright
orangey
color
ale
with
a
large
pure
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
dry
hops
with
nice
notes
of
floral
aromas
also
noticeable
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
dry
english
hops
with
nice
floral
aromas
with
light
caramel
malt
backbone
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
very
well
done
with
great
usage
of
fuggles
hops
d
i
hate
to
bash
a
craft
brew
but
this
just
wasnt
good
too
much
diacetyl
and
in
my
opinion
not
enough
caramel
malt
and
earthy
hops
to
be
an
english
ipa
bottom
line
if
youre
looking
for
a
westcoast
or
typical
american
ipa
look
elsewhere
if
you
want
something
more
toned
down
and
malty
you
might
want
to
try
this
better
than
most
but
just
a
tad
above
the
average
ipa
this
ipa
pours
nicely
has
the
amber
color
of
an
ipa
good
head
and
lacing
downhill
from
this
the
smell
is
of
kerosene
i
dont
know
what
else
i
detect
faint
hops
some
malt
the
taste
is
just
as
bad
no
floral
citrus
no
herbhop
just
an
old
smellytastng
beer
that
you
stole
from
your
dad
when
you
were
16
this
is
the
worse
ipa
ive
reviewed
thank
god
i
bought
a
single
its
a
drainer
dont
try
this
one
not
a
good
beer
by
any
means
drinkability
very
average
for
an
english
ipa
but
it
is
true
to
style
the
taste
malts
and
hops
are
both
just
average
and
neither
are
strong
enough
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
i
would
try
again
feel
fells
quite
nice
on
the
tongue
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
that
often
overpowers
the
citrus
and
slight
sweetness
nice
mellow
smoothness
characterizes
this
one
well
crisp
yet
smooth
enough
to
sip
enjoyably
wellbalanced
as
an
english
ipa
should
be
hops
are
there
but
they
are
not
in
your
face
decent
amount
of
bitterness
but
enough
malty
sweetness
to
balance
this
perfectly
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
brew
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
recommend
d
unique
and
refreshing
this
is
still
a
bit
of
a
challenge
to
drink
i
cant
say
that
im
well
versed
in
english
ipas
so
im
sure
this
has
something
to
do
with
it
however
i
wouldnt
want
another
immediately
but
this
is
an
interesting
example
of
what
ipas
can
be
without
the
traditional
american
hops
being
used
drinkability
is
good
tastes
fine
i
guess
the
mildness
helps
out
even
though
i
do
like
the
west
coast
ipas
which
are
much
more
pronounced
with
hops
this
is
an
ipa
for
someone
who
doesnt
really
like
ipas
that
much
a
good
start
for
someone
like
that
as
well
i
am
not
an
ipa
fan
but
this
is
one
that
i
could
have
more
than
others
id
say
you
could
pass
on
this
ipa
if
youre
a
real
fan
of
american
ipas
but
if
you
know
youre
a
fan
of
that
saaz
hops
dry
pilseners
flavors
but
borderline
that
american
boldness
give
this
a
try
personally
id
pass
next
time
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
several
more
of
these
this
would
be
a
great
summer
brew
a
decent
english
ipa
even
for
an
eipa
its
a
little
light
on
the
hop
flavor
although
the
bitterness
is
there
wheres
the
malt
without
any
balance
to
the
bitter
hops
this
is
not
very
drinkable
at
all
i
might
try
this
again
on
tap
if
i
saw
it
it
would
make
for
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
at
a
ballpark
with
a
loaded
hot
dog
the
initial
taste
was
crisp
bitter
and
refreshing
the
aftertaste
however
was
odd
similar
to
eating
raw
grains
its
not
bad
by
any
means
but
i
have
had
better
from
shipyard
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
retention
and
lacing
are
what
one
would
expect
from
an
ipa
aromas
of
fruity
dishsoap
are
the
first
things
to
hit
the
nose
followed
by
a
slightly
grassy
malt
backing
kind
of
bizarre
and
not
very
appealing
the
taste
is
also
unique
but
in
a
more
pleasant
way
at
least
at
first
grassy
grainy
malt
character
is
balanced
by
faint
hop
bitterness
its
nice
until
the
finish
where
the
dishsoap
returns
to
coat
the
mouth
and
throat
flavorful
yet
slightly
offensive
drinkability
all
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
kinda
weak
not
hard
to
drink
but
you
wont
see
me
finnish
this
6pack
by
myself
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
it
is
definitely
very
hoppy
with
a
very
dry
finish
d
kind
of
a
light
ipa
both
in
body
and
flavour
a
bit
too
acidic
imo
i
will
not
be
buying
again
in
the
future
drinkable
i
guess
i
couldve
used
a
buble
of
more
hops
dso
so
these
guys
are
hands
down
my
favorite
brewery
in
maine
their
beers
provide
the
backdrop
of
some
of
my
best
summer
memories
this
is
not
one
of
their
better
efforts
but
a
fair
shipyard
effort
is
worth
a
great
effort
of
a
lesser
brewer
d
not
a
beer
to
drink
many
of
as
the
herbal
hops
clash
with
the
salt
and
butter
flavors
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
it
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
like
some
other
ipas
out
there
that
being
said
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
if
it
crosses
my
path
to
give
it
another
shot
the
taste
is
citrus
a
fair
amount
of
juice
a
litle
turkish
fruit
molasses
pekmez
some
leaves
and
caramelly
bread
its
tasty
and
the
flavours
though
not
incredibly
strong
are
solidly
strong
and
consistent
with
good
balance
of
elements
and
enough
complexity
to
keep
it
going
bitterness
just
barely
edges
out
the
sweetness
to
dominate
the
finish
lightly
its
highly
drinkable
a
decent
brew
especially
if
you
dont
think
of
it
as
an
ipa
and
just
as
a
solid
beer
in
general
this
is
not
an
ipa
that
i
would
want
to
try
again
and
overall
is
an
average
beer
for
me
the
color
is
a
medium
copper
with
one
finger
of
white
head
not
much
aroma
other
than
a
trace
of
malt
and
a
trace
of
hops
to
set
it
aside
from
budweiser
taste
is
more
like
an
ipa
some
malt
and
minimal
hops
carbonation
is
just
about
right
if
this
was
a
pale
ale
it
would
be
a
solid
entry
but
as
an
ipa
its
fairly
wimpy
still
an
enjoyable
beer
just
not
the
hoppy
ipa
that
i
tend
to
expect
at
last
a
brew
from
shipyard
that
doesnt
have
that
familiar
buttery
flavor
this
isnt
too
bad
but
doesnt
hold
its
own
among
some
of
the
other
common
ipas
out
there
aroma
is
really
bland
i
can
barely
detect
any
type
of
hop
bitterness
but
a
solid
malt
nose
is
there
decent
copper
pour
slightly
orange
hue
with
a
mediumthin
head
and
minimal
lacing
creamy
and
thick
mouthfeel
good
filling
brew
flavor
is
much
better
than
the
aroma
but
i
wish
there
was
more
of
a
hop
presence
very
drinkable
more
of
a
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
d
the
best
english
ipa
ive
tried
so
far
wich
isnt
saying
much
ill
pass
on
this
one
for
money
but
if
someone
gave
me
one
free
i
wouldent

festival
2008
for

amber
colour
big
head
aroma
of
fuggles
hops
but
surprisingly
moderate
the
flavour
is
dominated
by
fuggles
hops
as
expected
but
there
is
also
a
noticeable
malty
sweetness
some
fruity
notes
and
a
piney
and
slightly
soapy
finish
the
bitterness
is
fairly
subdued
for
an
american
ipa
a
selection
in
the
shipyard
variety
pack
picked
up
albeit
on
sale
at
the
local
supermarket
twist
off
cap
smells
crispy
with
a
tart
hoppiness
like
goldings
pours
to
a
cloudy
orange
colour
head
is
big
bubble
foamy
and
laces
nicely
taste
is
very
different
for
an
ipa
although
this
is
stated
to
be
an
english
ipa
i
guess
now
i
see
on
the
label
that
its
made
with
fuggles
there
isnt
any
hop
bite
but
more
like
a
hop
grittiness
that
has
a
very
flat
bitterness
at
the
end
this
is
very
different
i
can
almost
see
this
brew
coming
out
of
a
wooden
cask
it
has
that
character
for
the
style
it
appears
spot
on
without
a
doubt
this
would
go
great
with
some
boiled
lobstahs
overall
a
very
average
tasting
beer
i
dont
find
anything
i
love
or
hate
about
it
in
fact
i
dont
find
too
much
to
even
talk
about
it
its
one
that
isnt
offensive
by
any
means
but
not
one
with
much
character
to
make
it
stand
out
d
i
am
a
big
fan
of
fuggles
hops
and
while
this
was
tasty
and
drinkable
it
ultimately
didnt
quite
deliver
the
goods
the
bottle
may
have
been
older
than
i
had
anticipated
because
the
notch
appeared
to
indicate
best
by
december
2007
this
drank
more
like
an
esb
rather
than
an
ipa
mid
body
good
carbonation
i
like
this
one
nice
to
have
an
eipa
with
all
the
aipas
out
there
and
in
your
face
with
hops
do
not
get
me
wrong
though
i
love
hoppy
beers
i
will
drink
this
again
i
like
ringwood
beers
and
english
ipas
but
this
beer
is
a
little
too
mellow
to
be
a
great
example
of
either
there
are
grassy
hops
up
from
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
with
the
creamy
and
fruity
ringwood
character
the
finish
is
dry
as
usual
with
shipyard
brews
and
moderately
bitter
with
peppery
hops
the
beer
is
a
clear
golden
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
moderatehigh
floral
earthy
hop
with
a
moderate
sweetness
the
flavor
is
moderatehigh
hop
mediumhigh
bitterness
yet
balanced
by
a
moderate
sweetness
carbonation
and
body
are
both
medium
overall
a
tasty
british
ipa
nice
hoppiness
good
change
of
pace
from
many
american
ipas
this
one
pours
a
dark
orange
and
is
capped
off
by
a
onefinger
tan
head
which
recedes
in
a
quick
manner
leaving
no
lacing
behind
aroma
reveals
malts
up
front
with
a
subtle
hop
essence
quickly
following
theres
a
little
sweetness
and
sourness
going
on
as
well
and
even
some
orange
peel
in
the
distant
background
tastes
spicy
citrusy
and
malty
with
a
decent
hopbite
mixed
in
the
fray
the
way
this
ipa
comes
at
your
nose
and
palate
is
definitely
different
than
many
others
but
i
personally
think
the
difference
works
here
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
its
not
overly
carbonated
but
theres
just
enough
there
to
keep
a
bit
of
crispness
around
it
goes
down
pretty
smooth
with
a
very
slight
almost
indiscernible
alcohol
heat
at
the
very
back
if
youre
looking
for
a
hop
bomb
this
isnt
it
that
being
said
this
is
a
pretty
good
drinker
that
has
some
complexities
of
taste
and
aroma
that
arent
overly
bold
but
make
for
a
pretty
good
experience
overall
this
is
the
sleeper
pick
of
the
season
so
far
d
moderate
to
high
i
will
have
this
one
again
one
of
the
worst
ipas
ive
had
i
didnt
think
it
was
possible
to
even
like
make
a
bad
one
very
faint
hops
smell
and
an
ever
fainter
taste
of
hops
in
this
one
to
add
to
this
its
a
relatively
low
abv
for
the
style
so
this
one
doesnt
have
much
going
for
it
would
not
try
again
the
beer
poured
with
a
hazy
burnt
orange
look
with
some
minor
lacing
and
a
thin
head
aromas
are
a
bit
weak
with
typical
hops
and
florals
nothing
too
impressive
taste
had
a
somewhat
metallic
bitterness
to
it
wrapped
around
the
bitter
hop
characteristics
decent
mouthfeel
helped
make
this
a
crisp
refreshing
ipa
overall
not
too
bad
but
pretty
average
overall
impression
well
its
a
good
beer
for
educating
your
pallet
for
fuggle
hops
if
you
want
to
learn
what
fuggle
hops
put
into
a
beer
this
is
a
good
source
other
than
that
its
a
pretty
disappointing
ipa
there
is
almost
no
malt
character
to
this
beer
and
because
of
it
the
body
is
lacking
as
well
without
an
appropriate
grain
bill
the
hops
will
mostly
contribute
a
considerable
amount
of
bitterness
creating
a
bitter
bomb
and
this
at
least
approaching
a
bitter
bomb
the
hop
flavor
is
there
but
it
is
greatly
reduced
a
better
grain
bill
would
have
brought
the
flavor
and
aroma
out
even
better
i
suppose
my
point
is
that
this
is
a
poorly
designed
beer
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
other
than
for
educational
purposes
body
is
mediumfull
and
smooth
drinkability
is
good
as
the
beer
is
as
stated
not
so
powerful
as
better
more
powerful
examples
and
is
therefore
rather
easy
drinking
alcohol
content
is
not
so
high
as
to
inhibit
drowning
in
a
few
of
these
pours
clear
golden
tan
a
halfinch
offwhite
head
evaporates
almost
instantly
but
leaves
faint
lacing
smells
of
caramel
malt
and
leafy
fuggles
hops
which
develop
a
light
apricot
fruitiness
on
the
tongue
the
beer
is
nutty
and
malty
toasted
grain
and
biscuit
flavors
are
dominant
gentle
hop
bitterness
and
hard
water
overtones
appear
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
as
expected
clean
with
moderate
chewiness
and
good
balancing
carbonation
a
sessionable
traditional
style
pale
ale
doesnt
begin
to
approach
the
greatness
of
the
best
examples
i
quite
liked
this
ipa
but
it
looks
like
im
at
odds
with
most
people
here
hazy
orange
body
with
a
sticky
white
head
that
laced
well
grapefruit
spice
and
brown
sugar
in
the
aroma
not
really
a
classic
ipa
taste
and
more
skewed
towards
the
malts
with
the
grapfruit
hops
only
coming
in
at
the
end
theres
a
pleasant
earthiness
to
the
whole
affair
kind
of
matches
my
expectations
of
an
english
ipa
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
and
pleasantly
drinkable
copper
color
relatively
thick
offwhite
head
and
a
decent
amount
of
lace
aroma
is
hoppy
with
some
maltiness
following
it
does
have
a
hoppy
taste
but
not
strong
with
malts
balancing
with
a
bitter
finish
i
think
this
is
your
average
ipa
one
of
the
better
shipyard
beers
fizzy
over
carbonation
and
thin
body
wow
im
not
sure
how
this
qualifies
as
an
ipa
out
of
a
mixed
dozen
i
came
to
try
this
redlabeled
craftedbrewed
macro
is
there
such
a
thing
india
pale
ale
poured
into
my
glass
a
coppergold
color
with
some
hazy
that
faded
as
i
drank
good
retention
decent
lacing
the
hops
in
the
aroma
is
nice
but
illdefined
and
not
striking
as
in
an
ipa
more
like
a
pale
ale
but
citrusy
and
vaguely
sweet
flavors
are
bitter
and
in
wine
terms
tanninlike
rind
or
peel
like
citrus
hops
bleached
malt
some
bread
slightly
grainy
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
and
carbonation
moderate
so
its
quaffable
but
i
remain
focused
on
the
fact
that
its
not
an
ipa
as
one
should
be
and
though
drinkable
if
presented
not
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
none
too
pleasant
and
with
an
entire
world
of
india
pale
ales
out
there
theres
just
no
reason
to
revisit
this
one
not
recommended
d
interesting
character
though
somewhat
rough
around
the
edges
begs
to
be
refined
drinkability
as
iimentioned
his
came
from
the
mixed
1
pack
so
after
the
export
ale
this
had
more
flavor
that
jumped
out
for
the
style
ipa
this
is
not
impressing
but
if
tasted
blind
youd
be
sorta
ok
with
this
one
but
youd
never
put
it
in
the
english
ipa
category
d
not
worthy
of
being
called
an
ipa
much
closer
to
a
pale
ale
in
flavor
and
aroma
but
other
than
that
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
d
drinkable
although
i
definitely
prefer
american
ipas
i
would
say
this
beer
is
the
definition
of
an
average
english
ipa
the
good
news
is
that
all
those
socalled
flaws
make
it
exceptionally
drinkable
even
if
probably
doomed
to
mediocrity
by
its
bastard
heritage
of
being
an
americanmade
english
india
pale
ale
uh
aeipa
poured
a
hazy
honey
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
not
much
lacing
nothing
too
special
but
not
bad
fuggle
hop
aroma
mild
the
flavor
is
nothing
impressive
but
the
mild
hops
are
nice
not
off
putting
not
tasty
i
guess
a
sort
of
classic
ipa
flavor
good
bitter
flavor
at
the
back
ill
notch
it
up
a
half
point
for
that
nice
body
and
mouthfeel
overall
nothing
impressive
i
would
have
again
if
i
were
looking
for
something
easy
to
drink
and
not
too
hoppy
pours
a
nice
deep
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
the
head
fades
but
never
goes
away
the
smell
is
fuggles
as
advertised
but
not
as
rich
as
i
would
have
hoped
for
the
beer
gives
a
decent
hop
flavor
with
a
good
bit
of
bitterness
but
once
again
not
the
level
that
i
would
really
look
for
in
a
good
ipa
the
reason
the
head
is
not
going
away
with
time
is
evident
in
the
mouthfeel
heavily
carbonated
with
a
decent
malty
feel
i
dont
think
that
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
look
for
this
one
but
id
love
to
see
it
on
tap
at
the
bar
thanks
for
the
beer
came
to
the
table
with
a
small
head
that
didnt
really
stick
around
color
was
golden
looked
like
a
good
lager
its
an
ipa
though
smelled
of
mild
hops
some
malt
going
on
not
very
strong
compared
to
other
ipas
ive
had
drank
nicely
but
without
a
very
complex
flavor
overall
okay
flavor
would
like
to
see
some
more
floral
and
hop
bitterness
but
very
drinkable
for
an
ipa
went
down
pretty
easy
and
fairly
quickly
good
d
pretty
easy
drinking
after
carbonation
has
faded
would
drink
another
but
not
search
it
out
as
a
must
have
a
very
nice
moderate
ipa
md
mostly
light
with
moderate
carbonation
satisfying
and
a
little
filling
plenty
enjoyable
but
i
would
have
liked
some
more
hops
i
normally
dont
pitch
beers
but
i
did
with
this
one
theres
not
much
flavor
here
but
what
is
present
is
very
unpleasant
i
know
they
were
going
for
an
english
style
ipa
but
this
is
just
so
lifeless
and
borderline
offensive
i
think
they
fell
short
of
their
goal
the
beer
pours
a
medium
copper
forming
a
thick
inch
offwhite
head
medium
spots
of
lace
slide
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
noticeable
hop
presence
but
with
more
buttery
malt
aroma
coming
through
the
taste
is
strangely
dominated
by
the
malts
smooth
delicious
caramel
flavor
up
front
and
finishing
with
a
slight
citrusy
hop
flavor
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
light
aftertaste
of
the
hops
good
flavor
and
abv
make
for
a
very
drinkable
ale
overall
this
was
a
very
tasty
beer
but
by
no
means
what
i
would
expect
from
an
ipa
not
perfect
but
right
up
there
as
one
of
the
best
ipas
ive
had
to
date
drinkability
i
would
have
another
perhaps
even
to
just
make
sure
i
didnt
get
a
bad
batch
i
think
even
with
a
new
bottle
though
i
wouldnt
be
all
the
impressed
overall
im
not
sure
if
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
or
just
the
low
end
of
the
ipa
scale
ive
got
five
more
bottles
so
ill
update
if
theres
a
difference
d
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
night
it
has
a
good
taste
thats
easy
to
enjoy

trying

thanks
joe
this
was
a
good
ipa
and
was
quite
true
to
style
the
single
hop
recipe
was
unique
as
well
i
could
probably
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
before
wanting
something
else
all
in
all
something
just
seemed
unbalanced
or
empty
about
it
give
it
a
try
and
see
what
you
think
all
in
all
i
think
this
a
rather
unbalanced
brew
the
bitter
and
slightly
burnt
flavors
would
be
fine
if
together
with
more
sweetness
aroma
and
body
but
alone
they
make
this
beer
subpar
for
ipas
eric
subtle
milder
fresh
hop
aroma
sort
of
citrusy
with
a
nice
sweetness
in
finish
mild
hop
taste
up
front
a
great
beginner
ipa
id
say
as
its
about
as
mild
as
ive
had
somewhat
thin
but
nice
mild
hop
bitterness
which
fades
quickly
worth
a
try
if
you
like
milder
ipas
poured
a
deep
golden
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
nice
white
frothy
head
and
thats
about
it
it
was
a
very
simple
the
bottle
boasts
as
the
one
hop
ipa
and
it
is
had
a
sunkiness
to
it
like
i
find
it
mass
brewed
beers
no
real
care
or
originality
it
seemed
pretty
basic
and
not
a
good
ipa
did
not
enjoy
at
all
flavor
was
bland
no
real
hops
and
no
real
tasting
notes
pass
decently
balanced
and
rounded
out
ill
be
lenient
here
as
this
would
not
make
a
bad
session
this
one
is
not
fruity
no
pineapple
or
big
cascade
westcoast
style
bite
just
a
very
drinkable
herbal
and
spicey
hardy
flavor
that
went
down
easy
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
chimay
chalice
poured
a
hazy
gold
with
a
slight
head
that
disappeared
quickly
but
left
a
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
aroma
is
almost
nonexistent
slight
hoppyflowery
smell
but
under
whelming
for
sure
taste
is
malt
up
front
with
a
bit
of
hops
at
the
tail
of
the
beer
with
a
slight
earthy
aftertaste
i
would
have
thought
this
might
have
been
sitting
at
the
beer
store
for
a
long
time
but
i
saw
them
offload
it
from
the
pallet
and
put
it
into
the
mix
a
six
rack
i
was
surprised
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
i
dont
think
i
will
be
looking
for
this
again
poured
a
deep
orange
color
with
decent
white
head
that
hung
around
for
a
while
aroma
was
sort
of
hoppy
but
just
didnt
smell
quite
right
flavor
was
a
bit
metallic
and
was
not
too
impressive
drinkability
was
low
as
i
didnt
like
the
one
i
had
mouthfeel
was
okay
might
have
gotten
a
bad
one
so
i
would
try
again
this
ipa
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
is
still
pretty
decent
not
a
lot
of
auroma
and
taste
has
a
fairly
salty
finish
this
beer
is
a
solid
one
from
this
maine
brewer
whenever
i
am
in
main
rhode
island
or
new
hampshire
i
make
sure
to
have
a
few
pints
from
shipyard
pours
a
clear
gold
nice
offwhite
head
at
first
the
nose
was
like
a
huge
pile
of
wet
grass
clippings
then
it
quickly
went
to
a
small
pile
flavor
is
a
bit
sweet
with
a
salty
bitter
start
and
finish
to
it
hops
are
there
but
do
not
overpower
or
kick
you
in
the
mouth
gives
a
balanced
approach
that
some
might
consider
thin
or
watered
down
i
just
say
it
is
what
it
is
feel
is
just
very
slightly
thicker
on
the
liquid
great
level
of
carbonation
caressing
the
tongue
overall
very
drinkable
a
different
kind
of
ipa
but
one
well
worth
trying
not
a
hop
bomb
the
taste
is
very
dry
and
lends
itself
to
a
bit
too
much
bitterness
an
ipa
is
supposed
to
have
a
lot
of
hops
but
this
isnt
a
very
balanced
beer
could
use
a
tad
more
malt
has
a
slight
citrus
taste
contributed
from
the
hops
though
surprisingly
though
the
beer
is
quite
buttery
considering
the
bitterness
final
statment
definately
in
the
english
style
not
overly
recommended
finish
is
somewhat
sticky
and
has
that
sharp
acidity
i
was
a
huge
fan
of
shipyards
pumpkin
ale
and
prelude
winter
warmer
their
ipa
was
good
but
not
great
the
taste
was
peculiar
didnt
seem
like
your
typical
ipa
and
lacked
the
hoppiness
usually
depicted
in
the
style
a
rather
bitter
finish
detracted
from
the
taste
although
the
appearance
was
very
good
with
a
nice
bronze
color
and
impressive
head
aroma
wasnt
very
ipalike
although
it
wasnt
bad
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
about
average
not
a
bad
brew
but
nothing
above
and
beyond
taste
was
slightly
grapefruitlike
with
slight
caramel
aftertones
lingering
behind
a
noticeably
bitter
finish
overall
a
good
beer
recommended
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
a
very
mediocre
beer
is
there
was
one
as
mentioned
in
other
reviews
there
is
plenty
of
tartness
without
the
corresponding
hoppy
bitterness
so
one
is
left
with
the
worst
of
both
worlds
the
beer
is
a
pretty
clear
orangish
yellow
some
head
some
retention
no
lacing
the
smell
is
a
bit
metallic
some
tartness
but
really
nothing
overly
substantial
or
unique
for
aromas
there
is
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
and
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
a
bit
on
the
watery
end
of
the
spectrum
the
taste
is
quite
bland
there
is
a
tartness
as
mentioned
but
it
is
not
particularly
dry
and
enjoyable
definitely
not
hoppy
and
crisp
so
where
does
that
leave
this
beer
im
afraid
that
it
is
just
a
mediocre
not
very
interesting
somewhat
refreshing
poor
imitation
ipa
that
one
would
do
better
looking
elsewhere
for
a
more
representative
example
of
the
style
as
the
beer
settles
in
there
is
an
ever
so
slight
tinge
of
malty
fruits
emerging
but
nothing
worth
holding
out
for
the
finish
and
aftertaste
are
as
mediocre
unidimensional
and
monochrome
as
the
rest
of
the
beer
got
to
be
honest
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
english
ipa
i
like
the
american
style
much
better
overall
this
was
drinkable
but
not
memorable
mouth
feel
was
slightly
fizzy
smell
was
very
sour
taste
wasnt
very
bitter
and
there
was
a
slightly
sour
aftertaste
d
after
becoming
accustomed
to
smash
mouth
brutal
bitter
american
ipas
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
defiantly
would
enjoy
with
as
a
session
on
a
hot
warm
or
cold
day
a
rather
wimpy
ipa
the
fuggles
hop
barely
noticeable
with
controlling
yeast
and
minor
flaws
not
terrible
but
not
memorable
except
as
a
failure
to
be
what
it
could
be
seriously
though
this
is
a
good
ipa
its
out
there
its
real
and
edgy
its
almost
painful
but
its
ever
so
beautiful
its
really
like
a
rothko
painting
take
home
message
this
brew
isnt
for
you
if
you
demand
balance
in
your
beverage
d
low
for
me
it
was
rough
fighting
through
this
one
i
will
give
them
another
try
just
not
anytime
soon
reminded
me
of
an
esb
i
suppose
and
those
arent
necessarily
my
cup
o
tea
but
if
they
are
yours
you
might
enjoy
this
one
if
youre
looking
for
an
american
sort
of
profile
however
beware
i
know
the
difference
but
some
people
have
been
caught
off
guard
it
seems
pours
a
rather
light
golden
color
with
an
average
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
into
a
decent
cap
the
smell
is
faint
i
pick
up
some
bready
malt
and
a
trace
of
hops
the
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
which
is
a
bit
metallic
and
bitter
fruitywoody
like
hops
the
feel
is
moderate
and
fairly
crisp
finishes
with
a
slight
bitterness
a
rather
average
brew
though
i
do
like
to
try
the
single
hop
ipas
so
i
can
get
a
sense
of
the
different
characteristics
of
that
specific
hop
the
beer
poured
a
medium
amber
with
some
reddish
highlights
is
a
fluffy
twofinger
head
that
doesnt
seem
to
be
going
anywhere
too
fast
the
smell
is
a
little
malty
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
and
maybe
even
a
little
citrusy
splash
before
the
hops
hit
the
palate
the
aftertaste
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
and
lingers
for
a
while
in
a
way
that
isnt
entirely
pleasant
this
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
and
i
found
myself
enjoying
it
to
a
point
its
not
a
horrible
little
ipa
but
i
doubt
ill
pick
it
up
again
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
but
dont
expect
much
more
than
average
notes
this
beer
pours
way
too
foamy
is
full
of
yeast
byproducts
and
leaves
a
long
unspectacular
aftertaste
next
time
ill
find
something
else
d
very
drinkable
ipa
not
a
session
beer
but
this
is
pretty
mild
if
you
want
to
knock
back
a
few
light
to
medium
bodied
an
ok
beer
but
the
flavors
dont
interact
the
right
way
for
my
tastes
its
ok
but
not
my
cup
of
beer
note
dont
swish
this
stuff
around
to
vigorously
in
your
mouth
it
will
expand
forcefully
and
out
of
your
nose
again
please
rethink
this
recipe
we
know
shipyard
is
a
well
established
brewery
but
do
us
a
favor
either
change
your
proportions
of
ingredients
or
rename
this
an
esb
and
you
may
be
on
par
with
this
one
started
drinking
fuggles
ipa
from
the
start
back
when
it
had
a
green
label
and
fuggles
wasnt
in
small
print
light
amber
with
a
bubbly
head
very
sticky
with
lots
of
lace
good
carbonation
visible
aromas
of
buttery
caramel
from
the
ringwood
yeast
and
the
malt
subtle
floral
hop
aroma
tastes
similar
to
many
shipyardringwood
brews
with
a
sticky
buttery
caramel
malt
base
but
with
plenty
of
bittering
hops
to
tame
it
floral
hops
come
through
with
every
sip
wonderful
ale
fruitinessjuicy
fruit
from
the
start
to
the
middle
with
a
bittersweet
finish
mellow
hop
bite
even
by
english
ipa
standards
but
flavorful
nonetheless
plenty
going
on
to
keep
it
interesting
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
goes
well
with
the
smooth
carbonation
an
underated
brew
because
its
compared
to
american
style
ipa
hop
bombs
try
it
again
and
appreciate
this
beer
for
what
it
is
d
all
around
a
fairly
quaffable
beer
but
it
could
benefit
from
a
boost
in
the
ole
grain
bill
if
nothing
else
its
a
good
reminder
that
cascade
is
a
new
variety
not
around
when
the
first
barrels
were
shipped
off
to
india
british
hops
keepin
it
real
brew
it
up
matt
overall
consumed
7
months
past
its
best
by
date
this
one
has
not
aged
well
very
little
hops
character
i
think
ill
try
a
fresher
sample
as
is
a
rather
subdued
ipa
more
like
a
subtle
pale
ale
flavor
is
overpowered
by
the
bubbles
let
this
one
sit
a
few
minutes
after
pouring
afterwards
an
underwhelming
arrangement
of
piney
hops
metallic
tinges
rye
malts
and
a
bit
of
leather
greet
the
tastebuds
its
not
awful
but
its
not
even
close
to
what
i
expect
from
an
ipa
the
mouthfeel
is
incessantly
carbonated
at
first
it
reminds
me
of
drinking
cola
with
a
mouthfull
of
sweet
tarts
a
light
body
gives
way
to
a
crisp
bitter
aftertaste
and
the
net
effect
is
nearrefreshing
but
not
quite
bottom
line
ill
be
passing
up
this
one
next
time
cheers
medium
amber
with
a
neverending
vortex
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
center
of
the
glass
this
shipyard
product
has
the
distinctive
nose
of
fuggles
as
this
is
the
only
variety
of
hops
used
to
brew
this
beer
with
this
being
the
case
dont
expect
to
be
blown
away
with
the
typical
overthetop
assault
by
hops
that
you
experience
with
most
ipas
especially
those
that
are
brewed
with
a
wide
variety
of
hops
you
will
have
a
beer
with
a
finely
tuned
and
welldefined
hop
essence
that
only
this
variety
could
emanate
sorta
like
you
would
experience
with
a
single
malt
scotch
rather
than
a
blend
of
scotch
warm
nose
of
marshmallow
moss
and
fresh
hay
bready
and
slightly
yeasty
a
wellmannered
and
understated
ipa
with
a
nicely
delineated
level
of
bitterness
that
makes
for
effortless
quaffing
with
none
of
the
associated
turbulence
that
one
might
have
from
consecutive
consumption
of
more
well
endowed
ipas
a
winner
due
to
its
distinctive
and
nonconformist
flavor
profile
this
beer
is
a
stray
from
the
fray
of
overweight
and
overabundant
ipas
on
the
market
today
clearly
worthy
of
your
time
and
attention
seems
to
be
an
underrated
beer
surprised
the
combined
score
is
only
an
80
i
would
have
guessed
it
would
be
closer
to
88
definitely
should
try
it
if
youre
and
english
ipa
fan
though
this
one
may
be
a
little
too
bitter
and
too
carbonated
for
the
style
d
not
worth
falling
in
love
with
average
at
best
nothing
stood
out
to
me
in
fact
it
was
rather
dull
and
one
dimensional
poured
a
crisp
orange
with
a
decent
head
that
was
slow
to
diminish
the
aroma
had
a
good
earthiness
to
it
but
was
not
that
strong
the
taste
was
fairly
well
balanced
with
light
citrus
hops
balancing
well
with
sweet
malts
the
beer
was
light
and
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
very
decent
ipa
nothing
spectacular
but
certainly
enjoyable
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
am
a
self
proclaimed
ipa
fan
so
you
might
disagree
if
you
do
not
like
ipas
overall
this
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
it
was
lacking
in
what
i
was
expecting
from
and
ipa
especially
and
englishstyle
ipa
not
a
bad
brew
just
not
the
best
pours
like
a
macro
lager
a
light
gold
color
with
a
mild
head
smell
is
non
existant
almost
water
and
corn
with
a
very
slight
hopness
taste
is
ok
doesnt
even
taste
like
an
ipa
though
maybe
i
got
some
kinda
wierd
lager
ipa
or
something
not
very
impressed
overall
this
beer
pours
a
nice
pale
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
brewed
with
fuggle
hops
aroma
is
nice
and
hoppy
and
not
by
too
much
the
taste
is
pretty
strong
with
a
nice
bitterness
to
start
off
with
its
true
to
the
style
as
in
it
does
not
overpower
with
hops
like
some
american
ipas
yet
it
still
delivers
on
what
a
traditional
english
ipa
should
be
it
also
leaves
a
nice
amount
of
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
throat
12oz
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lace
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
overly
sweet
with
malt
and
just
the
faintest
amount
of
hops
the
taste
starts
out
pretty
mild
with
some
faint
malt
and
then
a
long
dry
bitter
finish
the
flavors
in
the
taste
seem
all
out
of
whack
and
pretty
imbalanced
overall
i
dont
think
i
will
be
purchasing
this
one
again
i
dont
know
how
widely
available
this
beer
is
in
the
us
but
if
possible
id
opt
for
tremont
ipa
owned
by
shipyard
which
if
not
a
truely
representative
english
ipa
at
least
differentiates
itself
better
with
significant
butterscotch
flavors
that
the
shipyard
ipa
only
begins
to
hint
at
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
nice
head

tight
bubbles
and
pretty
lacing
the
aroma
is
faint
of
hops
the
flavor
is
hoppy
but
delicate
there
isnt
a
strong
malt
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
overall
this
beer
is
smooth
and
refreshing

quite
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
12


aftertaste

some
bitterness
and
orange
d
not
too
tasty
goes
down
ok
slightly
filling
its
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
but
its
not
a
beer
that
i
would
want
to
drink
unless
my
choices
were
extremely
limited
this
is
not
a
very
good
ipa
in
my
opinion
there
are
just
too
many
great
examples
that
are
just
as
easy
to
get
theres
a
few
floral
and
grassy
undertones
to
this
and
maybe
im
just
not
used
to
the
fuggle
hops
this
is
an
easygoing
5
80
abv
and
worth
a
try
once
just
to
get
a
range
of
the
style
the
orangishamber
hue
of
this
beer
is
similar
to
that
of
my
impression
of
this
beer
light
and
close
to
the
middle
of
the
pack
only
worth
a
try
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
from
the
big
guys
not
something
ill
buy
again

ales
i
have
been
told
most
and

all
of
shipyard
ales
are
fermented
with

if
so
it
is
not
a

to
the
element
it
lends
to
old

an

a

batman
this
beer
poured
with
a
huge
head
had
to
pour
twice
and
had
good
lacing
with
a
coppery
well
balanced
color
the
beer
had
a
good
nose
and
hit
at
the
mid
to
back
palate
on
mouth
feel
it
was
a
great
purchase
from
the
shipyard
family
of
beers
that
was
not
too
over
the
top
hop
wise
and
had
a
good
finish
ive
tried
this
beer
a
couple
times
but
i
cant
foresee
myself
buying
a
sixpack
of
it
it
is
okay
but
there
are
much
better
ipas
even
englishstyle
meantime
ipa
anyone
im
glad
i
sat
down
and
wrote
a
review
i
purchased
my
bottle
in
council
bluffs
ia
as
part
of
a
mix
match
sixpack
worth
a
try
just
moved
to
portland
last
night
went
out
today
and
made
my
first
beer
purchase
in
my
new
home
town
picked
up
a
6pk
poured
two
bottles
into
the
only
glass
i
brought
with
me
on
the
move
a
28oz
chalice
apperance
is
really
nice
nice
one
finger
head
that
slowly
fades
with
slight
lacing
as
the
beer
recedes
color
of
a
brand
new
penny
nose
is
quite
pithy
with
a
bit
of
citrus
towards
the
end
taste
follows
the
nose
quite
well
a
dry
hoppy
flavor
dominates
with
pine
wood
and
needles
a
slick
hop
oil
adds
to
the
flavor
and
is
very
well
balanced
with
good
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
i
am
definitley
going
to
fill
up
my
glass
again
i
really
like
the
beers
that
use
single
hop
variety
you
really
realize
what
that
hop
does
and
notice
it
more
when
it
is
used
with
other
hops
i
also
really
like
the
prospect
of
sampling
many
more
maine
beers
highly
recommended
drinkability
not
a
huge
fan
the
hop
flavor
is
there
but
not
in
a
good
way
it
tastes
strongly
of
hops
but
almost
a
vegetal
grassy
flavor
vice
all
the
wonderful
things
you
can
get
out
of
hops
skip
it
i
got
this
12
ounze
bottle
at
tanks
taproom
in
tampa
fl
it
poured
a
nice
light
yellow
or
gold
the
head
was
decent
size
but
the
retention
was
really
fast
with
only
a
bit
of
lace
the
smell
was
pretty
decent
and
well
blended
yet
hoppy
enough
the
smell
had
onnly
hints
of
hops
and
nothing
else
the
mouth
was
nice
and
rigid
solid
ipa
dont
drink
and
review
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
foamy
head
that
settles
quickly
light
aromas
of
hops
and
citrus
is
this
really
an
ipa
it
tastes
more
like
a
decent
pale
ale
to
me
hop
presence
is
mild
for
what
youd
expect
from
an
ipa
its
sessionable
but
if
you
want
an
ipa
i
would
pass
on
this
thanks
for
the
try
mikesgroove
not
bad
pretty
refreshing
fuggles
only
english
style
ipa
a
nice
contrast
to
some
of
the
more
extreme
west
coast
or
american
style
in
general
ipas
that
i
usually
consume
although
less
complex
than
some
of
your
more
mixed
hop
ipas
the
fuggles
give
this
beer
just
a
nice
simple
general
flavor
that
is
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
slighty
thicker
than
a
standard
lager
and
it
has
a
nice
balanced
malt
background
that
makes
it
a
simple
yet
solid
beer
i
cant
decide
it
just
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
particularly
the
bitterness
i
would
session
the
rest
of
them
though
i
got
a
sixer
so
no
doubt
i
will
drink
them
overall
impression
champagnelike
interesting
but
im
not
sure
either
this
brewer
missed
the
mark
on
the
english
ipa
or
i
just
dont
like
english
ales
probably
a
little
bit
of
both
in
this
case
not
recommended
from
the
bottle
pours
a
light
hazy
copper
with
a
whispy
foamy
head
with
very
nice
retention
the
smell
is
lightly
of
citrusy
fruits
this
continues
into
the
taste
with
some
nice
tang
and
a
pleasant
aftertaste
wellbalanced
and
light
on
the
carbonation
drinkable
and
a
good
choice
for
a
session
poors
amber
with
a
huge
head
that
lingers
not
very
long
little
lacing
this
beer
looks
alive
almost
so
much
carbonation
smells
very
fresh
and
hoppy
not
overly
strong
but
nice
and
subtle
taste
is
good
not
as
flavorful
and
bitter
as
i
would
of
liked
but
not
bad
either
finishes
better
then
it
starts
feels
very
fizzy
going
down
crisp
and
again
lots
of
carbonation
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
try
almost
tastes
like
a
lite
ipa
again
this
is
good
not
great
but
i
could
drink
alot
of
them
not
a
sipping
beer
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
jump
at
the
chance
to
have
another
one
shipyard
ipa
was
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
head
had
good
retention
and
left
some
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
the
taste
was
more
hops
than
malt
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
the
body
was
medium
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
drinkability
was
average
not
spectacular
but
a
decent
beer
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
down
another
mouthfeel
is
good
well
carbonated
but
not
too
much
drinkability
i
have
to
rate
low
because
i
just
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
and
dont
want
another
it
feels
fizzy
but
easy
drinking
the
hops
really
only
show
up
in
the
aftertaste
not
the
initial
sip
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
its
sweet
and
fruity
and
while
it
isnt
a
traditional
ipa
its
very
good
not
a
bad
beer
but
also
not
a
great
beer
too
little
of
everything
to
be
caled
an
ipa
when
drank
from
the
bottle
it
has
too
much
carbonation
when
poured
it
has
a
large
off
white
head
slightly
cloudy
gold
color
not
much
aroma
on
first
taste
bitter
and
astringent
not
much
else
going
on
except
for
the
hopp
taste
i
would
not
buy
it
for
the
price
if
youre
in
the
mood
to
try
and
ipa
that
is
not
one
buy
this
virtually
no
hops
to
this
if
anything
quite
a
bit
of
malt
weak
sauce
pours
with
a
decent
head
that
quickly
dissipates
leaving
very
little
lace
the
lack
of
an
aroma
predicts
the
lack
of
flavor
to
come
there
is
a
bit
of
banana
coming
through
maybe
the
yeast
was
wrong
just
lacks
that
little
something
that
makes
ipas
special
this
was
very
disappointing
had
this
on
draft
this
weekend
in
wilmington
nc
had
a
nice
pale
color
almost
reaching
a
shade
of
amber
but
light
was
low
in
the
restaurant
a
nice
white
head
at
first
pour
then
it
went
down
a
thin
ring
but
fluffed
up
nice
with
a
swirl
aroma
was
nice
fullon
hops
with
some
floral
hop
aroma
i
was
curious
how
this
straight
fuggles
ipa
would
be
first
taste
on
the
palate
was
almost
astringent
but
mellowed
quickly
and
finished
nice
a
little
of
the
malt
was
detected
but
this
ipa
was
hop
driven
with
the
malt
being
hard
to
come
through
and
that
was
good
i
was
in
a
hurry
to
finish
this
to
get
to
a
wedding
but
i
believe
this
is
quaffable
for
about
34
if
the
time
permitted

i
was
going

i

for

one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
from
them

a
hazed

some
sediment

very
active

up

a

for
a

not
a
great

fairly
drinkable
and
tasty

overall
a
substandard
ipa
not
an
impressive
beer
flavors
dont
quite
seem
to
meld
together
and
could
stand
to
have
stronger
hop
influence
the
sour
tart
and
musty
flavors
are
a
distraction
to
the
hop
experience
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
there
are
so
many
ipas
that
are
better
pours
a
solid

a
solid

a

here
not
a

hop
thing
goin
on
here
i
assume

ive
had
better
ipas
of
course

truly
a
decent

was
smooth

have

hops
up

malty
finish
fairly
refreshing
this
beer
is
by
no
means
offensive
but
not
great
either
it
needs
a
little
somthing
more
the
pour
is
darkish
gold
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
of
lace
after
three
quarters
of
the
beer
the
fruity
and
floral
hop
aromas
are
very
english
pine
citrus
and
sweet
malts
are
also
in
the
nose
this
tastes
like
a
hoppier
fullers
london
pride
starting
out
with
fruits
sweet
malts
and
floral
hops
followed
by
lots
of
grapefruity
hop
bitterness
the
body
is
lively
with
carbonation
but
in
a
good
way
not
in
an
overly
prickly
way
this
is
a
very
solid
offering
from
a
brewery
i
didnt
expect
a
whole
lot
out
of
drinkability
bit
of
a
change
of
pace
with
the
hop
flavor
decent
enough
brew
though
final
thought
very
unique
the
shipyard
brews
a
nice
ipa
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
good
whitish
head
lasting
a
few
minutes
settling
into
a
nice
foam
with
pretty
good
lacing
aroma
is
more
piney
citris
than
floral
quite
earthy
decent
but
nothing
special
taste
is
similar
but
with
a
good
malt
presense
to
back
up
the
fair
amount
of
hops
a
very
clean
and
crisp
and
quenchable
beer
very
nice
to
drink
which
i
would
if
it
were
available
to
me
this
ones
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
assertive
flavors
really
pack
a
punch
that
keeps
the
flavor
with
you
longer
than
you
would
expect
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
the
ststed
abv
good
medium
body
but
the
mouthfeel
was
a
tad
busy
with
the
carbonation
none
the
less
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
rather
complex
ipa
that
i
will
enjoy
again
in
the
near
future

out
a

the

the
flavor
starts
off
with
a
hit
of
butterscotch
turns
very

in

theres
no
question
this
beer
uses
ringwood
yeast
finishes
with
a
solid
hoppiness
though
not
as
much
hop
flavor
as
most
american
ipas
the
mouthfeel

pretty
good

overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
english
style
ipa
crux
average
english
type
ipa
i
like
the
idea
of
a
single
hop
ipa
and
this
one
is
o
k
ive
certainly
had
much
worse
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
though
i
might
get
it
again
if
i
was
in
maine
the
restaurant
didnt
have
much
to
offer
on
draft
couldnt
remember
having
this
before
not
a
bad
beer
it
was
a
clear
orange
with
a
medium
head
that
had
good
retention
some
lacing
it
had
a
fresh
floral
scent
and
a
nice
hoppy
taste
with
a
little
sweetness
id
rate
this
as
a
middle
of
the
road
ipa
overall
an
enjoyable
buttery
english
style
ipa
easily
drinkable
and
nothing
offensive
a
pleasant
brew
but
seeming
sort
of
one
dimensional
i
enjoy
a
more
complex
ipa
blatently
too
sweet
to
be
considered
a
serious
ipa
the
ringwood
flavoring
doesnt
blend
well
with
the
fuggles
hops
and
it
gives
a
somewhat
odd
crisp
sweet
taste
proudly
pronounces
itself
to
be
the
single
hop
ipa
not
sure
why
perhaps
they
should
have
used
some
more
hop
strains
here
goes
down
ok
due
to
no
body
and
artificialtasting
flavors
needless
to
say
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
one
pours
a
clear
golde
big
white
head
forms
some
nice
lacing
and
good
retention
smell
is
sweet
with
some
light
citrus
and
floral
hops
little
bit
of
caramel
taste
is
caramel
with
citrus
and
floral
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
i
think
this
is
just
fuggles
not
too
complex
but
would
be
a
solid
session
ale
thanks
drjay
shipyard
hit
another
homerun
with
this
beverage
i
strongly
recommend
you
give
it
a
shot
not
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
a
very
aggressive
pour
yields
a
head
that
should
come
from
a
typical
pour
fair
head
retention
very
sticky
lacing
that
looks
nice
but
thats
really
all
it
has
going
for
as
far
as
being
visually
appealing
smells
sweet
like
cake
batter
yes
i
said
cake
batter
absolutely
nothing
like
an
ipa
there
may
be
a
tiny
trace
amount
of
hops
hiding
in
the
very
back
of
the
smell
this
is
the
most
peculiar
ipa
i
have
ever
had
there
is
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
taste
but
its
woven
around
a
handful
of
other
things
that
i
cannot
readily
identify
almost
has
a
medicine
like
taste
to
it
in
the
middle
so
far
this
is
a
terrible
example
of
the
style
imo
the
mouthfeel
seems
a
bit
heavy
for
the
style
and
the
carbonation
level
is
totally
not
where
it
should
be
perhaps
theres
someone
out
there
who
really
enjoies
this
but
i
absolutely
do
not
care
for
this
which
i
consider
a
pitiful
excuse
for
the
style
drinkability
quite
drinkable
pale

not
much
in

and
educational
considering
its
solely
fuggles
bottle
pours
a
flat
goden
with
a
small
fizzy
white
head
lasts
pretty
well
and
produces
decent
lacing
has
a
subtle
hoppy
aroma
a
little
bit
of
light
citrus
and
touches
of
sweet
fruits
has
a
decent
carbination
a
sharp
taste
has
a
light
to
medium
body
with
an
alcoholic
texture
has
a
pretty
good
duration
with
a
good
aftertaste
this
is
pretty
good
but
seems
a
little
commercial
i
like
it
though
pretty
normal
looking
and
smelling
ipa
reddish
golden
color
bubbly
mild
hop
odor
with
some
malts
detectable
taste
is
sweet
with
a
hop
flavor
that
is
not
overbearing
the
sweetness
is
strange
and
hard
to
pin
down
almost
like
a
faint
molasses
taste
pretty
smooth
and
good
drinkability
overall
though
its
just
an
average
ipa
d
the
lack
of
body
along
with
the
pure
bitterness
with
no
balance
are
the
demise
of
this
one
drinkability
wise
ive
obviously
seen
worse
but
i
wont
be
picking
this
one
up
again
though
i
dont
find
this
to
be
a
very
good
beer
its
inoffensive
enough
to
have
a
few
of
im
sure
ill
look
back
on
this
and
laugh
somedaybut
it
wont
be
because
its
funny
i
have
a
beer
to
finish
now
overall
a
decent
ipa
worth
a
shot
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
if
you
dont
like
bitter
hops
you
probably
wont
care
for
it
though
pours
a
light
copper
color
from
a
twelve
ounce
brown
bottle
head
settled
quickly
smell
is
a
mild
hop
aroma
dont
care
much
for
the
taste
of
this
one
not
well
balanced
and
an
aftertaste
that
i
just
dont
care
much
for
i
wont
buy
this
again
and
i
wont
recommend
it
to
others
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
ive
had
much
better
still
a
good
beer
however
as
far
as
ipas
go
this
one
is
mid
range
thus
the
straight
3s
it
was
a
bit
weak
for
the
style
but
not
so
bad
that
it
let
the
style
down
the
color
was
a
cloudy
light
orange
the
smell
was
semibitter
the
taste
was
pretty
good
but
seemed
a
bit
watered
down
there
was
a
deffinate
bitterness
in
the
mouthfeel
and
it
lingered
in
the
aftertaste
for
quite
a
while
the
drinkability
was
fair
i
could
find
better
representation
of
the
style
but
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
not
mind
having
it
again
the
aroma
is
mild
citrus
oil
and
not
at
all
strong
like
most
ipas
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
pretty
carbonated
in
fact
i
detect
little
in
the
way
of
hops
compared
to
most
ipas
i
detect
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
in
the
taste
with
only
mild
bitterness
a
fair
beer
but
not
very
representative
of
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
but
not
bad
by
any
means
drinkability
is
fine
as
well
a
pretty
decent
beer
here
nothing
real
special
but
worth
a
try
if
its
cheap
pours
a
pale
amber
color
with
decent
head
aroma
is
almost
non
existent
barely
notable
are
typical
hop
scents
taste
is
a
little
thin
with
typical
hop
bitterness
taking
main
stage
along
with
buttery
undertones
and
a
bit
of
peppery
spiceyness
an
oily
mouthfeel
finishes
out
the
brew
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
brew
seems
watered
down
maybe
in
an
attempt
to
attract
macro
drinkers
the
english
ipa
is
one
of
my
favorite
types
of
beer
and
it
is
a
shame
to
see
it
watered
down
like
this
not
bad
beer
for
something
thats
as
easy
to
find
around
here
as
bud
or
miller
pours
a
dark
gold
color
smells
a
bit
citrusy
taste
is
hops
citrus
grapefruit
tasting
hops
its
actually
not
too
bad
mouthfeel
is
ok
and
the
finish
is
still
more
citrus
flavor
it
may
dominate
in
citrus
flavor
but
its
not
overwhelming
nor
does
it
taste
like
a
fruit
beer
its
nothing
to
get
over
excited
about
but
a
great
session
beer
thanks
to
sulldaddy
for
the
sample
drinkable
yes
good
not
sure
i
expect
something
heartier
for
an
ipa
with
a
bit
more
hop
character
overall
not
a
horrible
offering
but
1
that
has
so
little
flavor
the
coors
light
of
ipas
or
step
1
into
the
wonderful
world
of
ipas
after
hearing
lots
about
this
brew
i
saw
it
at
my
good
beer
store
and
decided
to
grab
it
pouring
this
beer
into
my
pint
glass
was
difficult
as
it
was
so
foamy
appearance
is
slightly
cloudy
with
a
lasting
head
on
it
and
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
up
through
the
glass
aroma
is
just
soso
i
dont
get
much
out
if
it
and
usually
i
get
tons
of
aroma
out
of
an
ipa
flavor
is
adequate
enough
bitter
slightly
earthy
decent
i
dont
pick
up
any
off
flavors
and
im
chalking
up
the
earthy
flavor
to
the
fuggles
mouthfeel
is
decent
its
just
okay
i
think
that
sums
up
my
overall
feelings
for
this
beer
its
just
okay
all
and
all
not
the
greatest
of
ipas
but
also
not
the
worst
this
would
definately
be
a
good
choice
for
someone
venturing
into
ipas
for
the
first
time
since
the
hops
are
not
kick
you
in
the
mouth
strong
worth
a
try
nice
reasonably
tasty
beer
here
nothing
special
but
i
could
see
drinking
this
again
if
it
were
on
sale
and
snpa
or
sam
adams
was
not
a
real
nice
dark
amber
colorbut
head
is
very
small
this
has
a
real
dry
hoppy
taste
it
sarts
out
with
a
little
cinnamon
and
spicesbut
ends
dry
and
hoppy
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumnot
bad
this
is
a
pretty
good
ipabut
there
are
others
better
one
of
shipyards
better
beers
less
hoppy
than
an
american
ipa
but
without
the
balance
of
an
english
too
sharp
in
the
flavor
the
single
hopped
ale
might
not
be
complex
enough
for
most
the
fuggles
just
arent
enough
for
me
pass
bought
and
consumed
at
four
winds
international
market
in
pensacola
a
place
i
now
realize
does
a
very
poor
job
at
keeping
their
stock
fresh
but
the
sandwich
ohhh
the
sandwich
i
ate
to
accompany
this
beer
poured
light
copper
with
a
nice
white
head
sweet
aroma
with
hint
of
the
fuggle
hops
light
in
body
with
nice
pine
flavor
and
a
slight
candy
sweetness
nice
lemon
flavor
comes
through
on
the
finish
but
the
sweetness
on
the
finish
becomes
a
little
overbearing
tasty
and
easy
drinking
a
good
example
of
the
lighter
side
of
the
ipa
world
poured
out
a
hazy
darker
yellow
brew
with
a
huge
head
smells
a
bit
wheatey
followed
by
a
bit
o
hop
scentnot
really
a
great
scent
in
my
opinion
tastes
of
medium
hoppage
and
not
enough
malt
to
back
it
up
mouthfeel
pretty
standard
nothing
great
not
a
very
good
ipa
try
something
else
decent
head
and
lacing
is
sticky
for
the
most
part
smelled
some
laid
back
hops
and
some
light
fruit
maybe
banannaplums
that
is
something
sweet
first
drink
was
water
with
some
carbonation
unbelievable
because
the
smell
is
somewhat
inviting
but
the
taste
just
lays
down
like
wet
paper
watery
mouthfeel
and
nothing
to
remember
rereview
the
next
day
like
waking
up
in
a
bed
next
some
ugly
girl
this
beer
tastes
downright
bad
in
the
light
of
day
and
i
just
had
a
second
one
not
recomended
okay
i
cant
imagine
an
all
fuggles
ipa
as
tasting
good
but
ill
keep
an
open
mind
bottle
obtained
from
liquor
mart
colorado
and
consumed
the
next
evening
pours
a
one
finger
light
tanyellow
head
over
a
nearly
crystal
clear
copper
liquid
smells
hoppy
oranges
citrus
in
general
grassy
cohumulone
copper
and
just
a
hint
of
pine
tastes
hoppy
pine
and
citrus
some
bitter
and
some
coho
but
not
as
much
as
i
was
expecting
theres
an
underlying
sweet
and
ester
fruity
that
supports
the
hops
apricot
diacetyl
sour
caramel
malt
and
iron
yummy
well
balanced
and
tasty
md
body
and
lightly
carbonated
very
nice
offering
there
is
a
light
mouth
feel
and
is
an
easy
going
brew
its
alright
but
nothing
spectacular
its
not
to
bad
but
its
kind
of
pushing
it
by
calling
it
an
ipa
d
not
bad
for
the
6
99
i
payed
for
the
sixer
but
there
are
much
better
ipas
to
be
had
for
just
a
buck
or
two
more
this
beers
saving
grace
is
that
it
would
be
an
excellent
crossover
beer
for
nonbas
or
newcomers
to
ipas
due
to
the
nonthreatening
presence
of
the
hops
its
easy
to
drink
if
its
the
right
temperature
the
closer
to
room
temp
it
gets
the
better
the
flavor
too
cold
and
its
way
too
bitter
and
metallic
its
a
maine
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
much
all
the
times
ive
drank
it
and
i
didnt
get
much
but
when
youre
in
the
middle
of
hartland
25
minutes
from
bangoryeah
its
better
than
bud
light
poured
a
moderate
copper
color
with
decent
white
head
that
fell
to
a
thin
ring
smell
is
hoppy
with
not
much
malt
present
taste
is
nice
and
hoppy
as
would
be
expected
finish
is
dry
and
bitter
good
example
of
this
type
of
beer
but
nothing
spectactular
easy
to
drink
and
real
thirst
quencher
just
like
a
glass
of
cold
water
thats
the
good
and
bad
thing
about
this
beer
had
on
cask
at
federal
jacks
clear
amber
slightly
tan
low
frothy
head
that
did
a
nice
job
of
clinging
to
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
was
of
warm
butterscotch
pudding
tastewise
i
picked
up
biscuity
malt
notes
a
posssible
citrusy
hop
finish
but
yes
there
was
a
butterscotch
flavor
in
there
as
well
to
end
on
a
positive
note
the
beer
was
easy
to
drink
sometimes
i
beleive
that
american
micros
brew
an
english
ipa
because
it
either
gives
them
permission
to
brew
a
weaker
american
ipa
or
to
disquise
a
badly
brewed
american
ipa
shipyards
looks
nicely
copper
to
orange
and
has
a
monster
chunky
head
that
lingers
it
smells
floral
with
underlining
aromas
of
light
wine
pine
malt
slightly
bready
and
tosty
tastes
lightly
malty
and
flavored
with
hops
has
notes
of
cider
caramel
grass
and
yeast
goes
a
bit
flat
in
the
body
and
continues
to
water
as
metalic
flavors
increase
into
the
finish
finishes
neutral
and
watery
bittering
hops
linger
a
little
while
not
my
favorite
ipa
but
maybe
a
bargin
for
what
it
costs
my
bottle
which
was
purchased
during
a
recent
trip
to
portland
me
poured
a
thick
spongy
head
that
slowly
melted
leaving
a
heavy
lacing
and
a
noticable
floral
hint
however
its
light
amber
color
and
mild
hoppiness
and
with
fuggles
no
less
makes
one
think
of
an
amber
lager
rather
than
an
english
ipa
this
beer
although
drinkable
would
not
survive
a
trip
to
india
hence
the
designation
of
this
style
not
bad
beer
that
finishes
quickly
but
is
forgotten
even
quicker
shipyard
brews
are
like
my
favorite
basketball
team
they
show
a
lot
of
promise
but
always
tend
to
come
up
a
little
short
of
their
billing
shipyard
ipa
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
very
thin
head
and
even
thinner
lacing
an
appetizing
appearance
indeed
the
aroma
however
was
nothing
discernable
no
bite
no
fruitiness
the
flavor
was
a
pleasantly
strange
mixture
of
hops
bubble
gum
and
banana
with
a
dry
and
hoppy
finish
actually
i
like
shipyard
ipa
just
as
i
do
the
dallas
mavericks
it
just
wasnt
as
good
as
i
had
expected
the
bottle
could
have
been
old
because
the
deli
where
i
got
it
has
four
friges
full
of
micros
and
they
still
have
winter
brews
available
and
its
the
middle
of
may
the
chiller
was
lighted
drinkability
well
are
we
talking
fruit
beer
or
ipa
for
fruity
beer
it
would
be
approaching
acceptable
as
far
as
ipa
goes
no
way
my
bottle
is
slightly
past
the
prime
date
i
really
should
try
a
fresher
version
i
would
hypothesize
that
the
lonely
fuggle
hops
are
still
going
to
be
less
than
substantial
regardless
of
fresh
or
slightly
ancient
not
very
impressive
for
an
india
pale
ale
a
fugglesonly
ipa
is
a
great
idea
too
bad
this
fugglesonly
ipa
doesnt
come
together
into
anything
resembling
good
beer
as
noted
above
im
extremely
tolerant
of
this
style
since
i
love
hops
so
much
shipyard
ipa
however
misses
the
mark
back
to
the
drawing
board
guys
and
this
time
remember
one
word
hops
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
beautiful
rocky
white
head
the
lace
was
particularly
delicate
and
intricate
relatively
low
carbonation
good
english
hop
aroma
with
a
background
of
malt
and
just
a
bit
of
butterscotch
its
a
well
balanced
beer
with
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
up
front
and
a
bitter
finish
medium
body
with
a
little
bit
of
a
metallic
feel
really
not
a
disappointing
beer
it
could
be
a
little
more
interesting
but
i
found
it
satisfying
another
american
company
brewing
a
uk
ipa
pretty
blah
not
the
stuff
this
dude
is
looking
for
pours
a
nice
amber
from
the
bottle
with
a
huge
frothy
head
that
looks
excellent
smell
is
fairly
subdued
for
an
ipa
taste
is
also
pretty
subdued
lots
of
fuggles
hops
but
nothing
else
not
a
very
interesting
or
exciting
ipa
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
in
this
beer
brought
it
over
for
a
ba
brewing
gathering
kinda
wish
i
had
picked
up
the
smuttynose
or
yards
not
a
bad
beer
but
very
much
in
the
middle
of
the
road
im
more
of
a
malt
head
than
a
hop
head
but
when
i
drink
an
ipa
i
want
a
really
hoppy
beer
with
lots
of
character
this
didnt
really
have
it
pours
a
light
golden
orange
with
a
big
buubly
white
head
and
plenty
of
streaming
bubbles
possibly
poured
a
bit
too
vigorously
smells
of
woody
resins
some
floral
spiciness
and
some
yeasty
fruityness
taste
is
of
spicy
fuggles
hops
a
bit
peppery
and
lingering
fruityness
somewhat
pilsener
like
crisp
and
dry
on
the
tongue
bottle
says
that
it
is
brewed
with
fuggles
only
way
too
one
dimensional
to
be
interesting
for
long
best
before
d04
but
it
still
seemed
fresh
nice
clear
orange
pour
with
a
massive
bubble
tan
head
could
really
smell
the
hops
bottle
stated
only
one
type
used
and
citrus
which
came
through
nicely
in
the
taste
dry
hoppy
finish
of
course
tangy
good
medium
body
brew
may
not
have
been
hoppy
enough
but
could
drink
this
most
of
the
day
and
night
very
thin
wash
of
carbonation
with
a
fair
amount
of
stick
going
down
amber
to
light
copper
hue
with
total
clarity
and
no
visible
action
soapy
somewhat
dredged
hop
on
nose
with
a
hint
of
weird
cilantro
and
some
clover
notes
crumbly
vacuous
hop
bite
on
back
of
tongue
butterscotch
almost
rancid
coats
everything
and
is
a
lowlevel
annoyance
though
somewhat
typical
of
many
offerings
from
this
company
cant
recommend
this
one
mouthfeel
is
actually
rather
messy
with
way
too
much
carbonation
it
seems
to
foam
up
in
my
mouth
and
makes
the
process
of
drinking
somewhat
unenjoyable
this
is
not
a
beer
i
see
myself
drinking
again
just
not
very
exciting
and
a
bit
messy
overall
12

it

compliment

nicely
given
the

hoppy

the

through
on

to
the

aftertaste
fairly
thin

not
quite
up

light
copper
amber
with

and
decent

smell
is
way
to

the

drinkability
decent
flavor
except
for
the
weird
fungal
smell
but
not
for
an
ipa
i
was
looking
forward
to
enjoying
an
ipa
after
a
long
day
but
i
was
disappointed
in
this
one
a
nice
hoppy
english
ipa
one
of
the
better
versions
of
the
style
ive
had
on
the
plus
side
as
the
bottle
states
this
is
a
onehop
beer
fuggles
so
now
i
know
what
fuggles
specifically
tastes
like
this
is
an
ok
beer
i
could
drink
many
but
its
nothing
that
stands
out
oelergud
pours
a
cloudy
golden
copper
under
a
huge
three
finger
white
head
that
settles
fairly
quickly
until
it
becomes
thick
film
then
lingers
forever
leaving
some
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
interesting
very
much
of
sweet
fruits
but
with
a
distinct
tart
twinge
to
it
the
mouth
is
gently
carbonated
and
somewhat
light
in
body
very
interesting
unusual
taste
fruity
tartness
and
flowery
bitter
all
rolled
into
a
musty
sock
at
first
i
thought
it
had
gone
bad
but
the
flavor
profile
grows
on
you
as
you
sip
down
the
glass
the
finish
is
musty
with
a
touch
of
what
seems
like
melon
then
the
dry
bitterness
kicks
in
not
parched
but
dintinctive
while
i
cant
say
im
crazy
about
it
this
beer
would
make
a
good
addition
to
an
ipa
tasting
as
it
is
sooo
different
this
ipa
seems
paler
than
most
ipas
it
is
a
pale
golden
color
a
medium
white
head
forms
there
really
isnt
much
to
the
aroma
some
light
florally
hops
are
suggested
but
never
assert
themselves
there
really
isnt
much
to
this
beer
in
the
way
of
taste
either
very
faint
floral
hops
with
a
small
amount
of
bitterness
diacetyl
enters
at
the
finish
making
the
beer
finish
on
the
sweet
side
drinkability
suffers
as
the
beer
warms
because
the
diacetyl
really
asserts
itself
and
dominates
what
little
hops
there
were
to
begin
with
really
this
isnt
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
this
beer
didnt
really
seem
to
exemplify
the
ipa
style
at
all
average
amber
appearance
not
a
lot
of
head
on
this
one
basically
not
very
exciting
smell
i
suppose
i
do
smell
some
floral
hops
in
there
which
is
a
good
sign
but
nothing
else
really
stands
out
besides
an
odd
sweet
and
musty
scent
taste
is
very
nondescript
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
a
beer
that
is
technically
a
microbrew
but
doesnt
really
have
any
qualities
that
make
it
that
much
more
interesting
than
cheaper
beers
i
used
to
like
this
beer
a
lot
for
some
reason
but
now
my
impression
is
that
it
really
doesnt
cut
it
in
terms
of
style
or
overall
taste
too
bad
light
biscuit
malt
flavors
up
front
with
a
touch
of
butterscotch
moderate
hops
come
inpine
cleaner
resinous
and
a
hint
of
citric
bitterness
medium

lively
feel
a

id
have
to
say
good
for
fans
of
hop
profile
beers
for
me
it
was
o
k
i
may
try
it
again
a

bead
rises
and
releases
more
of
the

and
hops
before
i
take
my
first
taste
a
nicely
done
combination
of
malt
and
cereal
husks
support
the
same
fruitiness
found
in
the
nose
firm
crunchy
and
dry
texture
close
off
the
experience
with
a
brief
aftertaste
about
average
on
the

my
local
grocery

keeps
popping
up
with

and
im
not
gonna
complain
so
far
i
love
this
brewery
it
pours
a
clear
amber
colour
and
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
the
bottle
i
poured
it
from
into

of
course
had
a

effect
of
bubbles
inside
that
i
dont
see
to
often
so
i
expected
some
lacing
on
the
mug
very
hoppy
aroma
had
me
assuming
that
it
would
taste
like
a
u

i
was

that
the
hoppiness
didnt
come
across
strong

loving

overall
this
was
a
nicely
authentic
english
ipa
we
havent
had
one
in
a

still
felt
it
a
little
light
in
flavoring
it
was
hard
to
separate
brewers
intent
and
drive
for
authenticity
from
presentation
at
this
particular
establishment
we
never
found
it
to
be
skunky
per
se
but
it
did
have
that
dingy
english
pub
vibe
through
and
through
the
hopping
was
there
and
surprisingly
piney
while
the
malts
were
washed
and
simplistic
but
clean
in
their
body
this
was
enjoyed
in
the
company
of
new
friends
who
we
had
been
meeting
here
and
it
served
its
purpose
as
a

without

do

a

twist
on

ask

fell

for
dunning
the

if
theyre
going

package
in

they
have
to
be
prepared

what
that
does

try
it

i
didnt

for

it
was

this
isnt

typical

but
it
is
good
not
that
i
like
the
ipa
style
as
i
drink
more
i
am
more
aware
of
the
bitterness
and
it
is
more
prevalent
in
my
mind
and
mouth
than
the
sweet
maltiness
i
tasted
on
my
first
sip
while
not
my
favorite
style
i
fully
respect
what
they
have
done
with
this
mouthfeel
wasnt

it
seemed

the

was

the
sediment
looked
like
yardwaste
despite
these
oddities
the
beer
gets
better
a
heavy
floral
aroma
leaps
from
the
glass
the
thistle
is
apparent
the
initial
taste
is
malty
and
mildly
hops
the
hops
do
not
overwhelm
making
this
seem
as
though
it
is
not
a
real
ipa
the
floral
effects
from
the
thistle
stand
out
giving
the
beer
a
tealike
quality
a
note
of
lemon
reinforces
the
tea
hints
giving
the
impression
of
lipton
tea
with
lemon
the
flowery
citrus
hints
continue
in
the
aftertaste
with
the
tartness
of
tea
lingering
i
am
not
sure
i
would
need
to
drink
this
again
but
it
is
a
unique
experience
the
bitterness
overpowers
the
malt
character
her
the
malt
comes
across
as
onedimensional
its
sweet
caramel
the
hops
are
bitter
piney
and
even
a
bit
resinous
some
balance
i
think
would
helo
here
nonetheless
its
drinkable
and
smooth
its
a
classic
so
its
worth
a
try
o
dominanted
by
the
herbs
a
struggle
to
drink
had
this
beer
ontap
at
a
new
british
restaurant
in
dc
it
wasnt
all
that
good
but
it
was
on
happyhour
special
so
i
ended
up
having
two
it
was
a
tad
sweet
for
my
taste
and
had
some
kind
of
sourysweet
sugar
thing
that
i
couldnt
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
was
like
prickly
or
something
i
suppose
its
name
is
fitting
overall
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
pale
ales
this
one
unfortunatly
did
nothing
but
disappoint
me
the
other
beers
in
the
same
batch
that
were
dated
the
same
in
the
case
at
the
store
had
what
looked
like
orange
peels
floating
in
them
this
beers
was
the
cleanest
looking
of
them
all
that
day
and
i
wanted
to
try
an
new
ipa
the
bottle
cap
was
secure
like
it
should
have
been
and
was
not
a
twist
off
so
im
not
sure
if
this
was
a
bad
batch
or
what
i
also
noticed
that
the
picture
displayed
here
shows
a
brown
bottle
the
one
i
had
was
clear
perhaps
i
will
revisit
this
brew
in
the
future
overall
this
made
me
think
more
highly
of
ipas
for
now
i
might
give
them
another
shot
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
the
bottle
is
clear
so
worries
of
skunkiness
are
present
luckily
my
worries
were
unfounded
as
the
beer
possesses
a
wonderfull
tropical
fruit
aroma
taste
begins
with
passion
fruit
and
mango
followed
by
a
rich
caramel
bready
middle
and
a
nice
bitter
grapefruit
finish
the
signature
belhaven
yeast
flavor
is
here
and
works
out
wonderfully
in
my
opinion
rich
mouthfeel
overall
a
wonderfull
ipa
i
really
lucked
out
and
must
have
gotten
a
fresh
bottle
as
the
hop
favors
and
aromas
are
better
than
most
domestic
ipas
that
i
have
had
highly
reccomended
im
heading
to
scotland
in
a
few
weeks
and
i
will
make
a
point
of
looking
this
beer
up
to
see
whether
its
been
duke
of
perth
or
the
bottle
deceiving
me
as
to
this
beers
true
nature
i
hope
duke
of
perth
had
it
right
id
actually
never
seen
this
one
on
tap
and
it
caught
my
eye
at
the
bar
so
i
figured
id
indulge
clear
light
goldenamber
pour
with
a
small
frothy
white
head
nose
was
crisp
and
flowery
sweet
with
honey
and
citrus
zest
pleasant
taste
wildflower
honey
lavender
orange
blossom
it
was
sweet
but
light
enough
to
not
be
sickening
or
syrupy
fresh
low
carbonation
lightmedium
body
easily
drinkable
didnt
really
come
off
as
an
ipa
and
was
pretty
lowkey
even
for
an
eipa
but
it
was
still
a
good
beer
id
probably
get
it
again
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
beer
pours
a
nice
amberish
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
but
has
a
little
bit
of
lacing
smells
of
very
earthy
hops
and
very
slight
malt
not
terribly
strong
but
still
pleasant
tastes
of
great
earthy
notes
and
slight
floral
note
but
very
pleasant
carbonation
is
great
and
this
light
bodied
beer
goes
down
really
smooth
with
a
slight
aftertaste
but
not
unpleasant
overall
a
very
good
beer
aroma
taste
and
mouthfeel
all
improve
as
the
beer
warms
i
would
have
given
it
higher
marks
if
i
had
let
it
warm
for
15
minutes
before
sampling
overall
a
pleasant
wellbalanced
ale
to
drink
while
tentatively
shopping
for
sofas
online
and
giving
the
cat
the
dont
you
dare
ruin
this
one
speech
im
fairly
certain
it
went
in
one
cat
ear
and
out
the
other
poured
from
a
clear
bottle
and
it
shows
its
a
bit
skunkey
in
aroma
and
in
taste
the
taste
is
also
astringent
with
bandaids
so
it
does
not
fair
too
well
in
my
book
head
was
nonexistent
i
wont
buy
it
again
however
im
glad
i
tried
it
im
always
looking
to
try
something
new
not
a
bad
beer
more
of
an
english
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
lightweight
grassy
and
floral
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
grass
tones
astringency
and
thin
body
but
none
of
these
are
bad
by
any
means
good
english
ipa
substitute
for
hot
weather
i
loves
me
some
belhaven
twisted
thistle
they
used
to
have
this
as
a
standard
on
nitro
at
the
sharp
edge
creekhouse
back
in
the
day
and
boy
do
i
miss
that
still
pick
up
a
bottle
here
and
there
sit
back
and
enjoy
an
excellent
afternoon
slugger
poured
from
a
500
ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
new
at
the
local
store
but
not
sure
how
fresh
dont
like
the
clear
bottle
this
pours
light
golden
color
with
a
off
white
head
the
smell
from
a
distance
is
already
a
tad
skunky
other
smells
light
hops
and
caramel
and
biscuit
malts
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
better
than
expected
higher
hops
than
most
british
ipa
caramel
and
biscuit
malts
not
skunky
as
expected
overall
an
excellent
english
ipa
more
malty
than
hoppy
delicious
nonetheless
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
saw
it
in
the
store
and
decided
to
give
it
a
shot
because
i
am
a
big
fan
of
hoppy
ipas
the
appearance
was
beautiful
and
clear
the
smell
was
very
floral
which
for
me
was
a
little
turn
off
but
there
was
some
hops
coming
through
the
taste
was
good
but
a
lot
of
the
hoppy
characteristics
seamed
unable
to
shine
through
and
balance
the
sweetness
so
like
i
said
a
little
sweet
for
my
pallet
and
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
hops
from
an
ipa
overall
not
bad
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
or
really
in
the
mood
for
at
the
time
a
decent
beer
for
an
english
ipa
my
personal
prejudice
is
for
more
hopped
american
versions
but
this
one
is
worth
trying
if
youre
looking
for
a
more
traditional
oldworld
styled
ipa
o
a
nice
example
of
the
english
style
ipa
very
sessionable
with
a
full
and
tasty
yet
not
overly
complex
flavour
o
nice
drinkable
ipa
embodies
the
english
style
for
sure
solid
brew
for
the
style
this
is
pretty
much
exactly
on
the
mark
it
is
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
doesnt
need
to
be
for
a
straightforward
successful
brew
note
other
reviews
are
so
different
i
wonder
if
theyre
drinking
the
6
1
export
version
ive
heard
about
overall
this
is
well
balanced
beer
but
not
as
hoppy
or
complex
as
many
ipas
i
would
have
it
again
but
it
really
should
not
be
labeled
an
ipa
a
really
intriguing
brew
the
blend
of
hops
with
the
inclusion
of
noble
hops
is
something
i
havent
had
before
which
makes
this
strangely
inviting
its
not
bang
on
style
but
i
really
rather
enjoyed
this
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
nice
and
unusually
hoppy
english
ipa
id
get
it
again
if
i
felt
in
the
mood
o
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
for
a
beer
labeled
an
ipa
but
it
was
very
tasty
it
could
use
a
little
more
hops
balance
but
overall
i
did
enjoy
it
and
could
have
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
d
easy
going
tasty
beer
a
good
session
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
thin
white
low
profile
frothy
head
that
clings
to
any
part
of
the
glass
it
touches
nose
is
floral
with
a
heavy
dose
of
grapefruit
and
a
good
supply
of
light
fresh
hops
smells
delicious
flavor
gets
a
lot
more
of
the
floral
character
with
a
mouthful
of
aromatic
and
pungent
fern
blended
with
a
good
dose
of
hops
and
the
citrus
is
barely
shining
through
mostly
overpowered
there
is
a
slightly
roastytoasty
character
also
the
beer
is
midbodied
and
very
crisp
the
aftertaste
is
roasted
with
a
little
citrus
sweet
and
a
wierd
semisweet
tang
the
finish
is
a
bit
sweet
and
sour
with
a
bit
of
pucker
and
drying
bitterness
too
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
the
smell
definitely
had
me
hoping
for
more
overall
a
decent
beer
i
wont
try
it
again
simply
because
it
is
not
for
me
but
i
could
see
how
some
would
really
like
this
smells
of
raw
chicken
a
terrible
skunkiness
overpowers
everything
does
not
taste
very
well
eighter
could
keep
drinking
it
but
i
dont
really
want
to
should
not
have
been
in
a
clear
bottle
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
sessionable
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
several
of
these
in
succession
this
brew
pours
out
as
a
dark
orange
color
the
head
was
a
little
soapy
looking
and
left
a
little
lacing
at
first
the
smell
had
some
earthy
hop
aromas
in
it
with
a
decent
malt
character
as
well
the
taste
was
malty
upfront
and
had
a
nice
hop
bite
on
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
almost
a
little
flat
overall
its
not
my
favorite
ipa
out
there
but
its
worthy
looking
into
pair
with
fish
chips
soul
food
d
4
i
like
the
flavor
of
this
one
and
it
is
certainly
sessionable
it
is
a
little
sweeter
than
ideal
and
light
on
any
knockyoursocksoff
flavors
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
packs
a
decent
punch
worth
a
try
at
least
once
before
this
bottle
id
only
had
it
on
tap
and
remember
liking
it
even
more
for
what
its
worth
overall
a
tasty
twist
on
the
style
i
was
not
blown
away
by
this
beer
but
this
was
quite
enjoyable
picked
this
up
at
the
biggest
beer
store
in
the
uk
beers
of
europe
ltd
clear
orangeyellow
pour
with
nice
two
finger
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
a
little
skunkiness
in
the
nose
when
i
opened
it
but
it
quickly
faded
and
gave
way
to
biscuity
sweet
malt
with
some
mild
floral
notes
and
hints
of
apricot
and
perfume
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
sweet
caramel
malts
with
the
apricots
from
the
nose
really
coming
through
as
well
bitter
hops
and
a
hint
of
pine
balance
it
out
nicely
im
also
getting
a
touch
of
buttered
squash
in
the
finish
nice
chewy
tangy
bitter
mouthfeel
thats
slightly
sticky
and
very
drinkable
the
initial
skunkiness
had
me
worried
but
it
really
turned
out
to
be
a
quite
enjoyable
beer
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
english
ipa
which
would
be
quite
sessionable
i
like
how
the
malt
sweetness
mingles
with
the
hop
bitterness
with
the
hops
winning
the
friendly
competiton
between
the
two
just
at
the
very
end
i
would
buy
this
again
if
i
wanted
a
fairly
mellow
ipa
with
just
enough
of
a
hop
bite
d
id
tap
that
also
my
old
soccer
coach
but
inreference
to
the
girls
soccer
coach
d
ok
but
nothing
great
good
malt
character
and
balance
drinkability
a
solid
english
ipa
the
packiaging
looks
cool
but
that
is
not
what
beer
should
be
about
drinkabiliy
was
pretty
good
some
slight
offflavors
but
light
bitterness
made
it
drinkable
i
do
love
me
an
earthy
beer
but
the
butter
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
d
balanced
brew
nothing
is
aggressive
really
easy
to
drink
for
sure
and
even
more
during
the
hot
days
of
summer
i
would
probably
not
use
a
clear
bottle
regardless
this
is
a
middleoftheroad
take
on
an
english
ipa
drinkability
its
a
nice
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavours
d
an
easy
beer
to
drink
can
easily
have
a
few
of
these
and
enjoy
them
overall
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
however
it
is
not
for
hopheads
because
it
barely
has
any
more
hops
than
the
average
english
pale
ale
d
goes

the
spot

i
enjoyed
this
well
enough
but
not
something
id
drink
all
the

just
might

favorite

beer
the
nose
is

from
the
glass
are
aromas
of
piney
hop
resin
green
tea
orange
peel
lemon
zest
toffee
subtle
honey
glazed
cornbread
biscuits
however
there
is
a
noticeable
skunkiness
to
the
beer
that
i
just
cant
get
past
unfortunately
bringing
down
the
score
slightly
medium
bodied
the
beer
has
a
smooth
dryness
yet
noticeable
hop
bitterness
an
almost
creamy
carbonation
the
beer
balances
the
flavors
found
on
the
nose
finishes
with
a
crisp
green
apple
asian
pear
overall
the
twisted
thistle
is
an
amazing
example
of
the
english
style
ipas
definitely
recommended
this
is
a
pleasant
quaffable
english
style
ipa
it
is
very
refreshing
for
a
late
summer
evening
i
suspect
it
would
be
even
more
so
if
the
ale
were
fresher
right
from
the
source
this
would
be
superb
very
drinkable
very
mild
ipa
yet
very
complex
in
flavor
very
nice
drinkability
nothing
too
exciting
here
im
glad
i
tried
this
though
t
for
an
ipa
the
sweet
fruit
comes
through
almost
strawberry
there
is
no
real
maltiness
at
all
and
the
hops
dont
jump
through
much
either
actually
more
like
a
watermelon
ipa
meh
md
moderate
body
fizzy
carbonation
mediocre
fairly
drinkable
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
the
floating
chunks
and
yeast
funk
were
a
bit
much
for
it
to
overcome
take
those
away
and
id
consider
it
worthy
hops
are
too
subdued
for
the
style
smooth
and
silky
mouthfeel
that
is
by
far
the
highlight
of
this
beer
the
malts
are
too
assertive
even
for
the
english
style
but
there
are
enough
little
things
going
on
around
the
edges
to
make
this
a
pretty
good
sipper
overall
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
delicious
and
well
balanced

i
would
like
to
drink
this
again

its
production
there
was
a
flowery
mildly
citric
hop
flavor
on
the
tongue
this
represented
for
me
a
welcome
bridge
between
toomild
english
ipas
and
overthetophoppy
american
ipas
hello
goldilocks
finish
was
a
nice
mix
of
hops
and
malt
very
pleasant
it
kind
of
put
me
in
mind
of
dfh
60
or
hop
tea
neither
bad
things
of
which
to
be
reminded
d
not
a
hop
bomb
but
a
nice
blend
of
hop
flavours
and
feels
with
a
little
more
present
maltiness
than
i
expected
the
great
balance
makes
with
very
drinkable
even
session
worthy
f
finishes
somewhat
bitter
as
the
hops
catch
up
and
build
to
the
finish
the
spicy
quality
seems
to
come
out
more
on
the
finish
with
a
little
earthy
chewy
and
grassy
hop
components
as
well
it
has
more
lingering
malty
flavors
a
little
sweet
malty
taste
lingers
but
its
not
sweet
its
mostly
dry
some
creamy
malts
also
there
but
not
very
much
medium
body
lower
smooth
carbonation
alcohol
well
hidden
very
nice
mediumlow
carbonation
gives
interesting
contrast
of
creamy
body
up
front
and
hoppy
not
quite
drying
but
sharply
bitter
finish
extremely
refreshing
and
id
love
to
have
this
one
again
this
is
what
i
love
about
english
ipas
the
malt
complexity
not
to
be
outdone
by
some
very
nice
hop
characteristics
that
combine
to
make
one
fine
drinking
beer
imo
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
tasty
and
compelling
id
gladly
drink
this
again
belhaven
has
impressed
me
quite
favorably
once
again
served
from
bottle
into
a
samuel
smith
imperial
pint
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
remains
there
was
no
apparent
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
hops
and
fruit
the
flavor
was
a
cross
between
a
sour
and
an
ipa
with
a
fruity
aftertaste
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
i
am
glad
that
one
of
the
employees
of
bestway
suggested
that
i
try
this
one
it
is
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
i
had
a
16
oz
pour
of
this
at
the
amsterdam
ale
house
in
new
york
i
know
that
belhaven
is
an
english
company
so
i
expected
a
lower
key
english
style
ipa
but
i
found
this
to
be
decidedly
english
in
style
while
still
having
a
very
aggressive
hopforward
character
color
is
is
darker
than
a
typical
ipa
aroma
is
good
hoppy
flavor
is
a
perfect
blend
of
malt
and
hops
very
good
drinkability
very
drinkable
would
say
that
its
a
medium
body
looking
forward
to
my
next
pint
of
twisted
thistle
i
found
it
especially
disappointing
because
the
initial
impression
seemed
interesting
and
a
nice
change
from
my
usual
diet
of
aggressive
american
ipas
alas
the
taste
is
slightly
caramelised
breadiness
with
tea
and
leaves
grapes
citrus
mostly
lemon
and
light
bitter
orange
a
bit
different
from
the
bottle
with
hints
of
caramel
light
yeastiness
it
is
nicely
balanced
with
light
sweetness
it
holds
up
very
well
to
food
and
is
highly
drinkable
found
this
at
mcouls
in
downtown
greensboro
nc
it
shows
a
clear
light
copper
color
with
a
solid
white
cover
and
decent
lace
the
aroma
offers
a
modest
citrus
hop
and
caramel
malt
pleasant
the
flavor
brings
obvious
applecitrus
hops
with
bright
toffee
and
light
malt
its
midplus
bodied
with
a
very
subtle
but
effective
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
a
very
decent
choice
if
youre
not
in
the
mood
for
the
higher
hoppiness
of
an
american
ipa
nice
example
of
the
style
dont
let
the
soso
aroma
fool
you
taste
is
unique
a
light
fruity
smack
with
a
small
hop
infusion
very
nice
mouthfeel
keeps
remaining
light
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
very
drinkable
nice
price
for
what
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
english
ipas
right
up
there
with
fullers
anyways
i
am
positive
this
beer
is
part
of
what
turned
me
into
a
hophead
and
for
that
it
shall
forever
hold
special
place
in
my
heart
the
end
im
partial
i
like
the
style
i
like
hops
i
like
scotland
no
surprise
i
like
this
beer
notes
well
for
a
supposedly
fresh
tap
pour
it
feels
a
touch
dull
and
not
particularly
worth
the
import
although
in
some
places
this
offering
rescues
otherwise
really
mediocre
tap
lines
overall
a
nicely
done
eipa
with
good
flavors
and
great
drinkabilitythanks
to
a
subdued
bitterness
and
easy
finish
the
use
of
cascade
hops
makes
it
very
similar
to
an
aipa
nose
was
a
little
too
laid
back
for
me
but
i
must
judge
according
to
style
would
like
to
see
this
in
a
sixer
from
a
25
fl
oz
bottle
labeled
l9265a
the
pour
is
a
nice
looking
ambercopper
with
a
halfinch
of
frothy
offwhite
head
and
excellent
clarity
overall
the
aroma
was
kind
of
a
letdown
i
noticed
more
malts
than
hops
but
overall
my
particular
bottle
smelled
rather
skunky
but
the
taste
gave
it
new
life
as
it
burst
with
modest
flavorful
hops
and
a
pleasant
background
of
caramel
malts
except
for
the
aroma
this
was
a
nice
beer
in
the
end
overall
i
enjoyed
this
not
sure
how
long
my
bottle
sat
on
the
shelf
at
specs
but
i
am
not
getting
much
hop
presence
in
this
beer
besides
a
short
burst
of
light
bitterness
on
the
finish
it
still
tastes
pretty
fresh
as
there
is
no
signs
of
oxidation
or
cardboard
flavors
honeyed
grainy
malts
seem
to
be
more
than
just
a
backbone
here
they
are
close
to
being
the
dominant
flavor
still
a
fairly
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
but
it
needs
to
be
more
than
merely
balanced
to
warrant
the
ipa
nomenclature
in
my
book
and
at
nearly
four
bucks
a
bottle
it
is
not
really
a
bargain
either
cheers
very
drinkable
not
too
many
at
once
just
one
or
two
at
a
time
but
def
worth
having
again
a
mild
approachable
english
ipa
would
make
a
great
starter
for
someone
dipping
their
toes
into
this
style
without
being
intimidated
if
it
werent
for
the
abv
this
would
make
a
decent
session
ale
this
is
a
winner
i
wish
there
were
more
on
hand
not
as
hoppy
as
i
had
initially
expected
from
an
ipa
but
this
has
a
really
nice
hop
flavor
that
is
satisfying
for
those
who
appreciate
a
good
ipa
and
welcoming
enough
for
others
d
a
good
beer
i
would
have
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
very
uk
taste
with
a
but
of
a
grassy
kick
the
abv
lingers
a
bit
in
the
back
of
the
throat
and
is
warming
to
the
body
very
drinkable
and
delicious
this
brew
is
good
but
is
kind
of
a
mixed
bag
it
almost
needed
to
go
more
in
one
flavors
direction
to
make
you
appreciate
it
more
it
is
something
that
was
decent
to
try
once
but
if
you
are
expecting
hops
you
will
be
disapointed
for
someone
that
isnt
big
on
over
hopped
ipas
this
may
be
your
thing
this
would
be
a
good
drinkable
brew
for
non
hop
heads
to
have
in
the
summer
at
a
party
poured
into
a
wheat
type
glass
nice
hazy
amber
yellow
with
a
big
head
that
hangs
around
and
decent
lacing
great
flowery
citrus
aroma
first
sip
i
could
taste
the
hoppy
bitterness
but
after
initial
sip
the
bitterness
gave
way
to
citrus
and
flowers
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
so
if
you
are
a
hophead
this
one
might
not
be
for
you
this
is
a
really
weird
beer
d
this
is
a
tasty
eipa
its
very
different
from
your
run
of
the
mill
american
ipa
its
more
of
a
crisp
dry
finisher
which
is
a
welcome
change
of
pace
id
drink
this
beer
again
i
poured
this
brew
from
a
pint
bottle
had
a
caramel
aroma
with
hints
of
biscuit
poured
golden
clear
color
with
a
minimal
head
tasted
a
medium
bitterness
lightly
sour
and
a
dry
bitter
finish
definetly
a
smooth
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
night
long
i
had
this
one
while
enjoying
some
pasta
with
shrimp
and
parmesan
and
was
excellent
complement
to
the
meal
drinkability
i
could
have
drank
this
all
night
ive
found
a
new
goto
beer
that
wont
let
me
down
when
i
dont
feel
like
trying
something
new
this
is
a
decent
beer
though
i
would
prefer
touching
up
the
hop
flavour
a
bit
it
has
enough
hops
for
the
nose
but
not
for
the
tongue
a
very
nice
change
from
the
usual
hopped
up
american
pale
ales
d
easily
drank
and
the
flavours
are
good
maybe
its
the
english
style
that
i
have
no
tried
but
this
is
unqiue
to
me
price
is
a
stopping
factor
for
me
though
d
for
the
ones
that
like
bitters
and
ipas
like
me
this
would
be
a
pleasure
a
very
good
esorry
about
that
lads
ipa
and
ramped
up
in
a
seemingly
measured
uk
manner
d
goes
down
easy
and
drinks
well
with
food
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
one
and
i
was
not
upset
by
it
at
all
tasted
great
and
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
well
worth
trying
overall
a
nice
english
ipa
id
love
to
try
it
on
cask
a
very
underappreciated
style
imo
theres
something
to
be
said
for
subtelty
dont
get
me
wrong
im
a
wc
hopbomb
sucker
for
life
but
that
doesnt
mean
i
cant
like
these
too
take
some
time
and
really
think
about
it
and
you
can
learn
to
appreciate
them
too
a
good
beer
d
what
ive
come
to
like
about
english
ipas
is
definitely
embodied
in
this
beer
not
so
intense
its
very
well
balanced
and
mild
enough
to
have
more
than
one
top
notch
d
a
nice
beer
thats
pretty
typical
of
a
well
made
english
ipa
this
one
ill
buy
again
drinkability
highly
drinkable
for
an
ipa
not
as
hoppy
as
the
american
versions
so
your
tongue
and
taste
buds
wont
fatigue
as
quickly
a
fine
example
of
a
modern
british
ipa
totally
worth
a
try
great
example
of
an
ipa
very
sessionable
and
belhaven
has
never
disappointed
this
beer
pours
a
nice
honey
colour
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
a
fast
vanishing
one
finger
head
with
only
a
ring
a
lacingit
has
a
nice
floralcitrushoney
hop
aroma
to
it
very
nice
indeedit
has
an
above
average
mouthfeel
with
a
dominant
citrushoney
hop
start
that
finishes
with
a
nice
touch
of
caramel
maltiness
and
a
tinge
of
bitterness
but
not
that
bitter
by
any
means
and
alcohol
is
well
hidden
making
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
as
a
session
beer
overall
the
best
eipa
ive
had
to
date
highly
recommended
for
anyone
interested
in
the
style
very
drinkable
recommended
a
solid
beer
just
not
outstanding
lots
of
little
yest
colonies
or
possibly
protein
floating
around
in
my
glass
big
floral
smell
reminded
my
of
an
apple
orchard
in
bloom
big
bitter
bite
at
the
front
and
settles
down
the
taste
lingers
a
bit
very
hoppy
which
i
like
but
the
balance
is
off
worthy
of
a
sample
though
beyond
the
appearance
everything
was
great
very
crisp
aroma
you
can
already
sense
the
strong
hops
flavor
tastes
great
very
rich
with
a
great
dry
finish
not
too
watery
drinkability
probably
the
best
english
ipa
ive
had
d
meh
this
isnt
an
american
ipa
this
is
a
very
bland
and
another
english
style
malt
bomb
smooth
and
easy
drinking
however
d
the
balance
abv
flavor
and
mf
makes
this
tremendous
a
great
session
beer
for
a
night
out
at
a
pub
this
is
a
delicious
refreshing
brew
very
nice
on
this
warm
summer
evening
d
a
real
nice
english
ipa
this
one
was
quite
fresh
and
very
flavourful
another
fantastic
beer
from
belhaven
cheers
not
a
whole
lot
of
an
aftertaste
not
much
bitterness
not
much
carbonation
a
smooth
beer
to
be
sure
and
easily
drinkable
really
solid
atmosphere
good
lookin
brew
and
a
simple
nose
that
youd
expect
from
this
style
hoppy
flavor
but
a
little
nice
malt
to
balance
it
out
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
i
think
this
could
be
the
first
scottish
beer
ive
tried
im
not
impressed
this
is
borderlinedrinkable
for
my
taste
just
way
too
bland
theres
nothing
interesting
about
it
it
actually
doesnt
really
have
anything
going
for
it
goes
down
smoothly
enough
just
not
that
great
how
is
this
averaging
a
b
had
this
on
tap
at
grechs
millbrook
inn
in
pond
eddy
ny
pretty
light
golden
amber
color
not
much
head
smell
was
dry
and
grassy
taste
was
fairly
light
and
watery
then
floral
hops
and
a
very
dry
finish
slight
offtaste
not
bad
but
not
great
not
worth
trying
if
you
like
robust
ipas
this
is
an
unusual
ipa
at
least
the
draft
version
i
had
at
an
irish
pub
in
kentucky
was
unusual
the
color
is
dark
straw
with
a
meager
head
but
the
nose
is
a
nice
slightly
floral
refreshing
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
in
the
draw
but
on
the
palate
this
one
is
pretty
tart
the
tartness
persists
through
the
finish
but
does
leave
a
slight
lingering
bitterness
this
is
not
the
greatest
ipa
out
there
but
it
is
belhaven
a
brewery
that
has
always
gotten
my
respect
this
said
i
would
still
drink
it
and
am
now
eagerly
anticipating
it
on
tap
an
ok
beer
i
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
a
very
moderate
ipa
english
i
suppose
is
the
excuse
was
very
surprised
to
see
cascade
hops
in
this
the
only
interesting
thing
was
how
smooth
this
beer
was
interesting
texture
for
an
ipa
other
than
that
very
average
nikki
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
for
those
who
like
very
hoppy
beer
this
one
is
not
for
you
pours
clear
gold
with
a
billowing
off
white
head
that
hold
together
nicely
smells
strongly
of
herbalfloral
hops
cannabis
tropical
fruit
and
sweet
malt
tastes
strongly
hoppy
without
being
terribly
bitter
lots
of
nice
earthy
herbal
notes
that
go
well
with
the
bready
malt
and
an
interesting
smokiness
lightmedium
bodiedthis
is
really
the
weakest
point
really
flavorful
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
taste
is
creamy
citrus
some
caramel
few
malts
some
wood
and
hops
in
the
back
ends
bitter
and
a
little
dry
quite
a
easy
to
drink
beer
worth
a
try
too
bad
there
arent
more
english
ipas
out
there
as
the
market
is
flooded
with
the
american
hop
bombs
worth
seeking
out
quite
enjoyable
not
a
bad
beer
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
on
a
summer
day
if
it
came
in
12oz
bottles
and
was
priced
a
little
better
at
4
99
for
a
500ml
there
are
better
ipas
that
i
would
enjoy
overall
a
very
drinkable
englishstyle
ipa
very
smooth
d
decent
stuff
with
an
interesting
flavor
profile
though
just
off
enough
for
me
to
be
satisfied
after
just
one
the
earthy
hop
profile
keeps
things
interesting
but
is
just
a
bit
too
strong
for
me
dark
orange
in
color
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
hoppiness
was
just
weird
it
was
a
floral
malty
scent
ive
gotten
out
of
ipas
sometimes
that
just
isnt
appetizing
even
if
i
werent
judging
it
against
the
much
better
west
coast
americanstyle
ipas
itd
still
be
a
poor
beer
in
my
opinion
with
weird
flavors
i
would
not
refuse
one
of
these
if
offered
but
i
dont
really
foresee
an
occasion
where
i
would
buy
one
of
these
again
given
the
current
state
of
craft
beers
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
with
a
very
good
taste
even
though
its
an
english
ipa
it
will
still
keep
hop
heads
happy
worth
trying
sometime
nice
to
see
the
scots
using
american
chinook
hops
this
is
really
more
of
a
hybrid
americanenglish
ipa
but
great
all
the
same
d
good
a
nice
change
up
cloudy
cloudy
more
than
i
expected
for
the
style
this
is
one
of
the
strangest
ipas
ive
ever
had
but
i
loved
it
cloudy
and
orange
great
balance
between
citrus
and
carmel
in
the
nose
sweet
upfront
and
bitter
in
the
back
for
the
taste
a
very
nice
bitterness
by
the
way
good
mouthfeel
a
great
bar
beer
very
drinkable
delicious
stuff
grab
one
the
appearance
could
be
good
or
bad
depending
on
how
much
you
like
cloudy
beer
this
one
is
very
cloudy
pours
pale
amber
with
a
modest
half
inch
of
cream
color
head
the
head
fades
rather
quickly
and
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacings
the
aroma
is
mostly
malts
some
yeast
and
floral
hops
taste
is
sweet
maltiness
with
a
firm
earthy
but
balanced
bitterness
the
richness
of
the
malts
is
way
more
than
typical
american
ipas
i
suspect
this
beer
may
be
a
bit
old
and
as
there
is
no
obvious
date
i
wish
i
could
try
it
from
a
keg
sometime
carbonation
was
typical
of
british
alessubdued
an
interesting
brew
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
all
it
pours
a
dark
orange
with
a
stubbornly
persistant
chunky
foamy
tan
head
its
rather
malty
with
some
caramel
and
toffee
notes
and
well
balanced
with
the
hops
which
has
a
light
orange
peel
slight
pine
and
resin
character
nice
mellow
character
that
doesnt
hit
you
over
the
head
with
any
particular
flavor
a
nice
ipa
and
id
drink
it
again
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
half
finger
of
head
that
leaves
tons
of
retention
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
not
super
strong
but
sweet
taste
is
smooth
and
sweet
hard
to
explain
as
i
havent
had
a
euro
ipa
in
so
long
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
with
a
clean
light
finish
very
drinkable
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
d
this
tastes
good
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
nothing
wrong
with
it
just
not
to
my
general
taste
d
the
pub
ale
flavor
would
get
overwhelming
not
overly
impressed
the
flavor
is
a
wonderful
combination
of
hoppy
bitterness
and
sweetness
with
notes
of
honey
orange
and
necterine
it
could
be
said
that
this
beer
is
nicely
floral
and
very
drinkable
i
loved
it
and
wich
i
could
get
this
beer
on
tap
locally
this
ale
was
extremely
smooth
and
pretty
enjoyable
and
it
may
be
a
nice
representation
of
an
english
ipa
but
definitely
not
what
i
was
looking
for
there
are
so
many
more
ipas
out
there
that
i
would
prefer
to
drink
the
easy
drinking
of
this
beer
is
scary
at
6
you
need
to
sip
but
the
taste
draws
you
in
like
a
moth
to
a
flame
from
a
1l
bottle
purchased
locally
aroma
is
like
lemony
iced
tea
color
is
a
golden
amber
that
is
clear
except
for
what
look
s
like
hop
particles
floating
around
flavor
is
malty
biscuity
with
some
hop
bitterness
and
citrusy
hop
flavor
in
the
finish
full
and
rich
but
not
too
sweet
but
still
balanced
a
little
toward
the
malt
do
not
expect
an
american
ipa
out
of
this
one
this
is
more
along
the
lines
of
an
english
ipa
that
is
more
balanced
and
malt
focused
a
slightly
bigger
pale
ale
d
damn
good
english
ipa
love
the
maltiness
definitely
a
classic
english
beer
i
could
drink
tons
of
this
cloudy

this

and
a
good
starting
point
to
get
people
into
ipas
has
a
milky
amber
complexion
solid
beer
with
few
flaws
but
no
outstanding
qualities
a
little
bit
of
a
twang
aftertaste
that
leaves
the
mouth
looking
for
more
i
would
not
search
for
this
beer
but
i
do
enjoy
drinking
it
i
am
a
general
fan
of
belhaven
and
this
beer
will
not
change
my
good
favor
of
the
brand
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
cloudy
light
copper
color
with
a
two
finger
khaki
head
the
retention
was
great
as
a
cap
and
the
lacing
was
in
thin
albeit
broken
bands
the
aroma
was
quite
appealing
citrus
hops
and
floral
hops
with
caramel
malt
and
some
hints
of
fruity
alcohol
esters
the
flavors
started
with
a
flash
of
caramel
malt
immediately
followed
by
a
blast
of
hops
hints
of
citrus
rind
and
tart
apples
behind
which
was
a
bready
malty
backbone
the
body
was
medium
full
the
carbonation
just
a
touch
high
and
the
mouthfeel
rich
and
quaffable
very
easy
to
drink
and
nicely
balanced
bittersweet
elements
d
very
drinkable
for
an
ipa
not
too
bitter
as
much
at
their
flagship
scottish
ale
sucked
this
one
is
quite
impressive
pours
clear
gold
with
a
decent
white
head
sharp
peppery
hops
that
actually
smell
like
a
thistle
astringent
hop
taste
more
on
the
english
ipa
spectrum
duh
its
from
scotland
with
a
decent
amount
of
orange
citrus
flavors
and
a
sweeter
honeymalt
finish
a
pleasant
surprise
final
thought
its
like
a
hybrid
of
doppelbock
and
pale
ale
in
a
bottle
its
unique
but
not
overly
memorable
500
ml
bottle
of
this
twisted
thistle
ipa
i
love
the
name
and
the
purple
label
with
the
thistle
flower
image
on
the
bottle
the
beer
pours
amber
in
color
with
a
big
pillowy
head
that
had
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
caramel
malt
biscuit
and
a
little
burnt
sugar
medium
bodied
as
it
moves
across
the
palate
sweet
malt
flavor
up
front
morphs
into
biscuit
in
the
center
before
finishing
bitter
the
slightly
dry
bitterness
lingers
for
a
few
moments
before
dissipating
away
this
is
a
respectable
brew
hoppiness
is
not
overt
like
most
american
ipas
but
is
in
line
with
those
brewed
across
the
pond
pleasant
indeed
easy
to
drink
and
balanced
another
solid
offering
from
belhaven
overall
a
very
balanced
beer
with
plenty
of
subtlety
as
you
would
expect
for
the
style
a
pleasant
easy
drinking
brew

good
this
is
a
smooth
and
easy
drinking
ipa
with
a
solid

quality
and
just
enough
malt
to
avoid
becoming

drinkability
is
not
great
based
on
the
bit
of
strong
cutting

more
so
as
it
warms
d
drinks
great
like
a
pale

should
drinkability
is
good
goes
well
with
dinner
though
a
bit
too
buttery
especially
as
it
warmed
i
think
the
label
and
back
of
the
bottle
make
you
believe
that
this
is
some
west
coast
hoppy
ipa
but
in
reality
this
is
a
decent
ipa
that
more
brit
than
pnw
no
matter
what
the
hops
are
in
the
recipe
orange
gold
with
a
pleasant
hop
nose
this
is
a
malt
influenced
ipa
that
has
its
own
character
you
know
it
is
scottish
i
like
it
but
had
to
quickly
realize
that
the
c
hops
dont
dominate
dark
gold
with
clear
liquid
and
a
small
head
aromas
are
citrus
like
an
american
style
pale
ale
a
good
amount
of
spritz
on
the
tongue
with
sweet
malt
flavor
and
fruity
esters
from
the
ale
yeast
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
lighter
coloredcompared
to
american
ipas
which
have
become
dark
for
the
styleenglish
ipa
but
with
an
american
chops
profile
nice
hybrid
from
our
friends
across
the
pond
d
yeah
drinkability
is
good
better
than
i
thought
its
closer
to
a
nut
ale
or
pale
ale
but
thats
for
the
better
i
couldnt
pair
this
with
much
but
its
definately
a
good
beer
extremely
drinkable
i
wish
i
bought
more
than
one
bottle
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
some
time
d
solid
allaround
and
very
easy
to
drink
ill
buy
this
one
again
tastes
very
flavorful
with
the
hop
bitterness
spicy
and
crisp
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
ipa
very
typical
for
an
english
ipa
but
still
one
that
is
to
be
enjoyed
truly
a
score
when
you
arent
expecting
to
find
it
a
smooth
mediumbodied
drink
with
a
flavor
profile
that
doesnt
blot
out
senses
and
pound
the
palate
giving
belhavens
ipa
excellent
drinkability
for
style
mostly
clear
light
orage
color
with
one
finger
of
bubbly
white
head
that
hangs
around
a
while
smell
is
really
nice
clean
crisp
slightly
bitter
with
a
grape
finish
taste
is
nicely
bitter
very
well
balanced
with
a
mild
honey
malt
backbone
and
flavors
that
match
the
aromas
very
well
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
light
definitely
crisp
pleasant
so
clean
and
balanced
i
could
drink
this
all
day
a
very
interesting
beer
without
being
over
the
top
or
extreme
pours
a
crisp
orange
with
a
nice
frothy
head
that
lasts
as
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
great
lacing
aroma
is
some
mild
citrus
hops
and
sweet
malt
the
taste
a
nice
crisp
medly
of
citrus
hops
with
sweet
malts
right
behind
creating
a
nice
balance
the
beer
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
and
while
there
is
some
stickiness
its
not
overbearing
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
example
of
the
style
worth
a
try
d
i
love
this
one
its
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
some
diehard
hopheads
may
be
disappointed
but
i
can
definately
see
myself
drinking
more
of
this
in
the
future
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
mfd
over
all
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
ipa
i
guess
i
expected
more
after
drinking
belhaven
scotch
ale
not
horrible
but
i
wouldnd
buy
it
again
a
rather
strange
and
unique
ipa
this
is
a
solid
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
its
worth
checking
out
this
is
a
good
english
ipa
id
like
a
little
more
hop
bite
and
a
little
less
malt
sweetness
but
then
again
my
preference
is
for
american
ipas
over
english
ipas
that
said
i
could
session
this
beer
the
balanced
flavor
and
light
body
make
this
ipa
very
drinkable
with
only
6
1
abv
this
is
an
excellent
session
beer
m
d
mediumfull
body
with
appropriate
carbonation
the
alcohol
content
limits
its
drinkability
just
slightly
but
the
complex
and
wellbalanced
favor
warrants
at
least
a
few
pints
a
very
interesting
brew
an
englishstyle

brewed
by
scots
using
american
hops
poured

run

dissipating

that
released
nice
light
floral
tones
and

good
deal
of

but
not

nice

d
moderate

per
style
sparingly
hopped
and
watery
palate
disappoints
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
good
ipa
and
i
saw
this
one
thought
id
try
it
out
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
clear
coppergolden
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
smell
is
milder
than
i
expected
slight
malty
undertones
and
a
vauge
earthy
hop
pressence
the
taste
is
outwardly
malty
im
not
getting
much
in
the
way
of
hops
other
than
bitterness
for
balance
again
maybe
just
a
touch
of
earthy
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
with
a
foamy
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
an
ipa
but
maybe
thats
the
difference
between
an
aipa
and
an
eipa
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
2
inches
worth
of
foam
and
lovely
lacing
down
the
glass
a
nice
thick
cap
settles
in
a
stays
put
the
entire
way
down
aroma
of
nice
piney
hops
and
floral
sweetness
in
the
nose
taste
is
somewhat
hoppy
but
not
over
the
top
good
use
of
piney
hops
with
hints
of
grapefruit
and
lemon
peel
followed
up
by
a
good
dose
of
caramel
malts
very
bitter
and
dry
on
the
finish
full
bodied
thick
in
the
mouth
and
good
carbonation
that
tingles
the
tongue
a
nice
english
ipa
the
taste
is
well
layered
with
a
nice
base
of
toasted
malt
and
a
solid
overlapping
of
broad
flavorful
hops
and
light
citrus
not
withering
or
overpowering
but
for
me
quite
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
okay
for
a
less
alcohol
doused
ipa
than
im
used
to
and
matched
by
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
for
me
this
is
a
textbook
example
of
the
style
and
extremely
sessionable
not
for
those
expecting
a
hop
bomb
but
will
certainly
have
its
admirers
i
dont
find
it
drinkable
ill
por
the
rest
in
the
sink
now
and
pour
an
ipa
home
brew
overall
an
uneventful
event
d
definitely
drinkable
i
could
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
my
favorite
english
style
ipa
that
ive
had
thus
far
definitely
recommended
d
this
paired
well
with
smoked
sausage
and
is
a
nice
change
from
yet
another
ipa
contrary
to
some
reviewers
i
didnt
get
an
overwhelming
contribution
from
the
smoked
malt
more
of
a
pleasant
secondary
note
1
creamy
offwhite

retains

different
mouthfeel
above

otherwise
mouthfeel
is
almost
a
nonfactor
neither

crisp
a

that
dissipates
really
fast
d
it
is
a
very
nice
ipa
but
i
am
not
into
english
ipas
good
mouthfeel
but
less
carbonation
and
thickness
this
is
a
nice
cross
between
a
scottish
ale
and
an
ipa
but
its
not
all
that
compelling
love
how
the
hops
just
keep
on
giving
after
the
sip
providing
an
incredibly
long
finish
twisted
thistle
great
name
forces
you
to
remember
it
not
in
a
tongueripping
way
but
no
hop
enthusiast
will
walk
away
unimpressed
a
good
ipa
with
slightly
more
malt
than
normal
a
solid
and
very
drinkable
brew
try
d
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
it
hardly
blew
me
away
it
just
didnt
have
that
same
vibrancy
as
others
of
the
style
still
not
a
bad
effort
appearance
a
very
nice
rich
amber
color
with
a
nice
creamy
two
finger
head
that
disolves
slowly
smell
of

orange
and
malt
taste
has
hoppiness
like
a
grapefruit
bitter
lightly
toasted
malts
and
maybe
even
a
little
nutty
mouthfeel
is
a
good
silky
medium
a
little
different
than
what
im
used
to
in
an
ipa
but
thats
what
makes
tasting
these
beers
more
enjoyable
one
of
the
few
english
ipas
that
ive
had
so
far
i
am
delighted
with
it
the
killer
overthetop
pacnw
ipas
that
i
imbibe
on
a
daily
basis
really
make
me
enjoy
the
simpler
style
presented
here
a
great
brew
reasonably
drinkable
albeit
somewhat
boozy
at
a
6
10
percent
that
you
can
really
feel
ill
enjoy
this
for
much
of
the
3rd
quarter
of
the
celtics
game
but
again
there
is
balance
in
quantity
of
the
malts
and
hops
but
something
just
seems
too
drastic
in
the
transition
drinkability

from
the
bottle
this
is
a
hazy
pale
amber
color
with
a
substantial
white
head
that
subsides
quickly
leaving
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
slightly
biscuity
the
taste
is
malty
and
biscuity
with
a
hint
of
lemon
tartness
and
a
slight
piny
hop
bite
at
the
finish
the
beer
is
rich
and
smooth
but
it
lacks
the
hop
intensity
and
complexity
one
would
expect
in
a
good
english
ipa
as
a
beer
this
tastes
fine
as
an
ipa
it
disappoints
d
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
clean
i
could
session
this
beer
until
i
ran
into
the
collective
might
of
its

abv
im
going
to
have
to
try
this
one
again
in
the
summertime
as
it
would
probably
be
a
great
brew
to
satisfy
the
yardwork
intake
to
me
it
just
lacks
the
something
special
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
its
journey
drinkability
sometimes
a
hybrid
works
sometimes
it
doesnt
an
interesting
stab
at
a
scottish
take
on
an
ipa
but
it
didnt
float
my
boat
d
i
have
often
over
looked
drinkability
when
it
comes
to
ipas
and
this
beer
has
made
me
reevaluate
that
opinion
its
high
drinkability
really
allows
its
depth
and
complexities
to
manifest
into
great
taste
decent
brew
but
id
hoped
for
more
16
9oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
golden
amber
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
and
enticing
with
sweet
buttery
malt
and
piney
hops
the
taste
is
balanced
very
nicely
with
a
strong
malty
backbone
to
support
a
nice
bitter
finish
from
the
hops
the
hops
are
definately
there
but
they
do
not
take
over
the
brew
like
many
american
ipas
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
ipa
that
is
recommended
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
big
white
head
and
some
small
sediment
on
the
bottom
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
very
busy
beer
one
of
the
few
english
ipas
ive
had
i
believe
smell
is
good
much
more
malty
and
subdued
that
most
american
ipas
but
it
is
an
interesting
change
of
course
it
has
some
hop
aroma
to
it
but
it
isnt
a
specific
style
just
hops
taste
is
really
flipping
good
i
enjoy
it
alot
it
almost
tastes
more
like
a
pale
ale
with
some
ipa
thrown
in
good
beer
all
around
this
beer
poured
a
pretty
copper
color
with
a
fluffy
singlefinger
head
the
nose
is
mostly
sweet
malts
with
a
faint
whiff
of
something
like
honey
the
taste
is
largely
sweet
malts
that
give
way
to
a
fairly
unique
middle
flavor
that
may
very
well
be
the
thistles
and
finishes
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
almost
creamy
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
but
im
not
sure
i
could
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
at
a
time
its
nice
in
the
mouth
because
its
so
mild
to
me
this
is
a
beer
you
could
drink
on
a
while
because
it
doesnt
get
boring
however
it
never
got
exciting
this
beer
is
the
pussy
cat
of
ipas
had
on
tap
at
the
beveridge

in
w
seattle
they
love
it

very
drinkable

ashy
as
it

its
a
loverly
sweet
beer
white
wine
with
a
smoky
overlay
really
nice
indeed
a
little
bit
too
bland
and
subdued
for
my
tastes
i
really
feel
like
the
hops
could
do
with
a
bit
more
of
a
kick
to
them
and
im
not
sure
this
works
in
the
bottle
as
well
as
it
might
in
other
formats
and
cask
in
particular
all
those
hop
heads
can
have
the
american
and
double
ipa
this
is
for
me
a
great
malt
flavor
but
it
also
has
plenty
of
hops
a
damn
good
english
ipa
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
drinkability
a
tab
tough
for
me
i
love
hoppy
bitter
but
not
astringent
or
soap
flavor
overall
i
think
its
a
nice
mild
ipa
drinkability
interesting
but
not
on
my
short
list
wondering
where
all
those
hops
in
britishstyed
beers
went
theyre
all
in
this
beer
very
wellbalance
with
more
of
a
sweeter
flavor
like
sweet
citrus
yet
mildly
hoppy
and
clean
with
a
ton
of
highly
bitter
beers
on
the
market
here
on
the
west
coast
this
beer
makes
a
great
crossover
from
the
everyday

500ml

and
a
bit
of
carbonation
poor
lacing
aroma
is
decently
hoppy
but
not
exactly
strong
taste
is
nicely
bitter
in
a
typical

sessionable
and
solid
pours
a
nice
light
amber
with
a
great
head
and
good
lacing
not
quite
as
dark
as
most
other
ipas
but
still
nice
a
great
scent
a
great
hoppy
ipa
with
a
wonderful
addition
of
a
floral
scent
tastes
great
a
nice
hoppy
ipa
without
overdoing
it
although
almost
no
thistle
taste
goes
down
great
the
smoothest
ipa
ive
had
in
a
while
overall
perfect
balance
and
immaculate
drinkability
make
twisted
thistle
ipa
a
beer
for
all
occasions
this
bad
boy
pours
a
nice
honey
amber
that
is
not
too
thick
or
cloudy
when
going
in
for
the
aroma
you
find
a
gloriously
subtle
hop
scent
this
has
the
piney
bitter
taste
i
enjoy
in
by
ipas
with
the
bitterness
really
hitting
you
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
and
as
it
goes
down
the
ol
gullet
i
could
see
drinking
quite
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
that
is
for
sure
hops
up
front
nice
bitterness
with
a
refreshing
citrus
note
floral
tastes
in
the
finish
that
eventually
turns
to
the
grainy
malt
interesting
to
taste
an
ale
thats
back
heavy
on
malt
rather
than
hops
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
the
lack
of
strong
bitterness
in
the
back
ups
the
drinkability
considerably

a

a

that
took
away
from
the

quotient
it
sure
looks
like
a

but
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
this
is
one
beer
id
like
to
try
on

sometime

again
in
the

with
a

more

yeasty

this

is
one
of
the
most

the

of

my

read

european
standard
i
guess
sampled
on
9407
from
500ml
bottle
into
a
tumbler
all
i
had
available
slightly
hazy
yellow
aroma
speaks
highly
of
a
malt
profile
taste
also
left
me
wondering
about
the
hops
left
me
with
a
gummy
palate
first
ever
to
do
that
tons
of
floaties
undertones
of
blueberryraspberry
with
slight
bitterness
not
much
to
say
about
head
or
lacing
drinkablilty
is
seriously
dampened
by
the
conditioning
way
too
much
bloating
effect
for
me
to
me
this
is
a
niche
brew
i
will
not
try
again
the
hops
start
out
surprisingly
with
fruit
juice
note
its
a
bit
sweet
and
biting
which
makes
for
an
odd
and
somewhat
unpleasant
feeling
and
taste
the
malt
was
smooth
and
almost
invisible
while
the
aroma
was
weak
i
guess
it
was
worth
trying
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
one
overall
i
was
impressed
i
am
still
a
fan
of
the
us
version
much
more
just
because
i
really
dig
the
huge
ibu
bitterness
and
that
citrus
hop
punch
but
this
let
me
really
see
how
the
style
originated
and
how
far
it
has
really
been
pushed
it
was
extremely
drinkable
and
superbly
smooth
to
say
that
this
one
was
good
would
be
about
right
i
still
think
there
should
be
different
categories
for
this
as
opposed
to
our
big
hops
but
irt
can
hold
its
own
as
a
session
ale
anyday
very
nicely
done
and
something
i
will
be
sure
to
try
again
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
old
forge
restaurant
in
massachusetts
it
was
presented
in
a
pint
glass
and
had
a
light
golden
color
clear
with
a
2finger
foam
the
aroma
was
muted
hops
and
although
i
didnt
know
this
was
an
authentic
uk
ipa
i
commented
that
i
thought
it
was
of
the
uk
style
after
seeing
its
from
belhaven
brewing
on
ba
i
see
my
suspicions
were
correct
oh
well
i
was
hoping
to
try
local
beers
but
this
wasnt
bad
the
aroma
and
flavor
were
balanced
but
leaning
toward
the
hops
side
the
body
was
light
thicker
than
water
but
not
as
much
as
i
prefer
a
very
easytodrink
representative
of
an
easyto
like
beer
category
a
great
english
style
ipa
probably
the
best
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
try
highly
recommended
full
and
rich
mouthfeel
very
satisfying
not
what
i
expected
at
all
for
the
style
but
tasty
in
its
own
way
pours
a
clean
light
copper
color
with
a
white
head
a
nice
aroma
of
grapefruity
hops
a
nice
bitter
taste
and
a
graefruity
hop
end
it
also
has
a
nice
aftertaste
of
hops
i
was
not
expecting
something
this
tasty
to
come
from
the
uk
but
it
is
very
good
overall
a
moderately
interesting
beer
worth
checking
out
once
as
an
example
of
an
ipa
from
scotland
but
thats
about
it
this
is
a
nice
unique
ipa
perfect
gold
with
a
slight
orange
hint
suitable
head
that
laces
the
glass
for
the
remainder
of
your
drink
smell
is
only
slightly
hoppy
dry
with
citrus
and
honey
dominating
the
aroma
taste
is
refreshing
citrusy
but
smooth
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
belies
its
6
1
abv
rating
a
very
good
beer
the
taste
on
first
sip
follows
the
nose
lots
of
malt
though
the
sweetness
is
subdued
compared
to
the
smell
followed
by
a
generous
amount
of
hop
flavour
that
is
mostly
bittering
and
only
slightly
citric
its
a
pretty
different
approach
to
an
ipa
than
im
used
to
but
i
think
it
works
nicely
at
least
my
palate
isnt
complaining
i
notice
that
at
various
times
during
the
session
sometimes
the
malt
dominates
sometimes
the
hops
do
and
that
keeps
me
interested
and
makes
me
want
to
keep
on
sipping
i
really
like
this
scottish
ipa
and
im
sure
ill
be
picking
up
some
more
the
finish
is
pretty
dry
and
crisp
man
at
about
3
a
bottle
this
is
one
heck
of
a
bargain
too
my
hats
off
to
belhaven
drinkability
decent
drinkability
for
an
ipa
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
ipa
ive
greatly
enjoyed
every
beer
that
ive
had
from
belhaven
though
so
it
was
no
surprise
good
malt
character
and
hop
balance
not
bad
for
an
english
ipa
but
my
tastebuds
have
really
developed
a
fondness
for
the
aggressive
american
ipas
this
is
a
very
impressive
ipa
one
i
wish
i
saw
more
of
on
tap
here
here
in
baltimore
or
anywhere
else
for
that
matter
kudos
to
friscos
for
featuring

wish
the

werent
present
im
pretty
sure
that
my
version
is
around
5the
bottle
has
been
sent
for
recycling
so
i
cant
check
but
i
hope
some
day
to
try
it
on
cask
this
beer
poured
a
light
clear
amber
with
a
nice
off
white
head
there
were
many
active
little
bubbles
coming
up
through
the
body
the
smell
was
very
nice
piney
spicy
hops
with
a
sweet
buttery
biscuit
note
the
taste
was
sweet
and
malty
up
front
the
sweetness
was
fruity
like
apricots
the
bitterness
was
there
at
the
end
piney
with
a
little
spiciness
a
little
too
much
malt
not
much
just
a
little
the
mouthfeel
is
buttery
smooth
and
the
tight
carbonation
with
the
ending
hops
make
this
very
drinkable
wouldnt
really
mind
but
i
surely
wouldnt
be
boasting
about
it
overall
recommended
i
just
would
love
to
try
it
fresh
i
actually
got
this
beer
by
accident
one
of
my
buddies
ordered
a
different
belhaven
brew
and
the
waitress
brought
the
ipa
so
i
took
it
at
half
off
cant
beat
that
the
taste
is
a
bit
better
lightly
bitter
with
a
zesty
hop
character
it
finishes
with
a
metallic
almost
ironlike
note
the
bitterness
is
fairly
subtle
especially
if
compared
to
an
american
ipa
but
is
still
quite
hoppy
notes
of
menthol
mix
with
pine
a
touch
of
bergamot
and
even
a
hint
of
cinnamon
to
form
the
dominant
hop
flavors
the
body
of
this
beer
is
quite
light
this
could
definitely
be
a
sessionable
brew
if
it
wasnt
for
that
cheesy
note
the
cheese
character
really
is
quite
subdued
in
the
flavor
just
so
long
as
you
arent
particularly
inhaling
as
you
take
a
sip
of
this
brew
and
is
only
noticeable
at
times
still
the
flavor
finishes
a
bit
too
metallic
and
a
bit
too
thin
to
really
keep
me
interested
d
an
alright
ale
but
not
a
great
english
ipa
it
has
subtle
hops
and
agressive
carbonation
a
kind
of
palate
cleanser
if
you
will
not
too
strong
at
6
1
abv
but
suitable
for
style
not
extremely
inviting
a
shade
on
the
bland
side
i
might
not
seek
it
out
even
though
it
is
as
good
as
some
bitters
i
have
tasted
decent
d
i
really
dont
like
this
just
very
weird
flavors
for
me
and
it
just
seems
like
none
of
it
goes
together
this
is
a
honeycolored
beer
with
thick
white
sheets
of
lacing
that
stick
like
crazy
it
gives
off
the
aroma
of
honey
clover
cracked
grain
and
grassy
hops
the
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
is
quite
striking
chewey
and
grippy
the
beer
is
a
creamy
blend
of
herbal
hop
bready
grain
camomile
and
other
tea
flavors
and
bitterness
that
creeps
in
just
at
the
end
in
fact
the
artfully
subdued
bitterness
is
the
only
thing
that
might
keep
this
ipa
down
in
the
score
for
taste
i
expect
a
little
more
bite
while
an
american
consumer
seeing
ipa
on
the
label
might
have
the
expectations
let
down
a
bit
this
is
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
comes
across
more
as
a
hoppy
pale
than
an
ipa
but
again
we
tend
to
be
spoiled
by
the
typical
american
overkill
but
if
its
a
pale
its
a
damn
good
one
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
id
definitely
buy
this
one
again
drinkability
a
nice
birthday
beer
to
have
wasnt
thinking
much
going
in
but
was
pleasantly
suprised
tastes
like
a
cross
between
and
american
and
english
ipa
doesnt
have
the
normal
stale
taste
i
usually
equate
with
the
english
style
bright
tasty
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
picked
up
this
pint
in
new
jersey
pours
a
big
creamy
head
on
yellow
lace
in
glass
aroma
is
metallic
as
if
it
was
poured
from
a
can
taste
is
thin
creaminess
and
burnt
there
is
a
moderate
bitterness
and
a
ignificant
maltness
overtaken
by
the
burntness
this
was
not
finishable
one
of
my
favorites
pours
with
an
applecidery
hue
superimposed
on
a
bright
pale
ale
with
a
collar
of
foam
and
tons
of
sticky
lacing
left
on
the
glass
big
beefy
aroma
for
an
english
style
beer
with
some
funkyearthy
hops
and
smoky
malts
coexisting
uneasily
minty
aromas
crop
up
as
well
on
the
tongue
robust
pale
malts
smoky
flavors
mixed
with
caramel
malts
bump
up
against
a
surprisingly
bitter
and
acidic
hop
attack
some
nice
bready
flavors
come
out
toward
the
finish
along
with
some
metallic
notes
this
ipa
has
a
lot
going
on
lots
of
different
flavors
and
sensations
mouthfeel
is
brash
with
hop
oils
big
carbonation
and
thick
malts
overall
this
is
a
rather
americanized
version
of
an
english
ipa
but
its
still
a
good
beer
well
made
imbalanced
but
flavorful
interesting
and
tasty
i
know
that
the
english
ipa
is
another
animal
far
removed
from
our
own
in
the
us
less
malts
hops
and
abv
but
that
shouldnt
mean
a
sacrifice
in
flavor
the
pour
and
aromas
were
promising
enough
great
sticky
head
followed
by
piney
hops
and
some
playful
fruity
malt
but
on
the
first
sip
nothing
slight
malts
more
grassy
than
expected
earthy
finish
flat
hop
profile
no
character
just
watery
bitterness
usually
a
fan
of
belhavens
brews
but
this
one
comes
up
very
short
taste
is
of
toasted
burnt
oak
bigger
malts
on
the
tongue
than
hops
for
an
ipa
stupid
scots
i
forgive
them
though
its
different
than
most
american
ipas
and
definately
tasty
feels
light
dry
and
bubbly
on
the
front
of
the
palate
leaving
a
hoppy
finish
ill
probably
have
this
again
at
some
point
good
complexity
and
very
refreshing
one
of
the
best
english
ipas
that
ive
ever
had
refreshing
more
so
probably
because
i
had
it
right
after
the
belhaven
wee
heavy
what
a
contrast
2
great
but
very
different
beers
pours
a
hazy
pale
orange
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
leaves
sticky
webs
of
lace
across
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
it
recedes
nose
is
dry
grains
along
with
earthy
and
grassy
hops
taste
is
toasted
malt
along
with
smoky
peat
followed
by
an
herbal
hop
bitterness
the
peat
is
rather
unique
in
this
style
of
beer
but
it
seems
to
work
very
nicely
in
this
particular
brew
drinkability
very
good
good
balanced
taste
great
visuals
and
aroma
good
mouthfeel
really
enjoyed
this
english
ipa
as
my
first
uk
ipa
i
thought
it
was
very
flavorful
without
being
overly
hoppy
or
bitter
as
common
with
american
ipas
a
mellow
flavorful
brew
quite
decent
copper
in
color
with
a
pillowy
head
a
little
yeast
in
suspension
too
earthy
hops
in
the
aroma
with
some
caramel
and
a
slight
hint
of
smoke
smoky
peat
flavor
with
the
earthy
hops
leading
into
a
nicely
bitter
finish
also
noticing
some
orange
zest
pretty
dry
finish
and
really
refreshing
was
able
to
give
this
one
a
try
the
other
night
on
tap
the
brew
poured
to
a
orange
to
copper
color
with
a
fair
sized
head
that
surprisingly
had
a
good
amount
of
retention
and
did
leave
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
down
the
whole
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
nice
clear
hop
scent
but
it
was
not
overpowering
at
all
also
was
able
to
pick
up
a
biscuit
scent
that
seemed
pretty
strong
which
seemed
to
mute
the
hop
aroma
for
some
reason
this
is
what
i
have
grown
to
expect
from
a
english
ipa
more
rounded
out
than
our
american
brews
that
seemed
to
be
serious
hopped
up
on
hops
either
way
i
love
both
styles
and
am
not
sure
that
the
differences
are
just
something
that
i
am
perceiving
or
not
anyway
back
to
this
brew
the
taste
was
very
good
as
it
has
a
smooth
quality
to
it
a
strong
hop
taste
is
noticeable
up
front
but
not
sure
if
that
is
because
i
was
expecting
it
from
the
scent
of
the
brew
it
did
seem
to
break
away
from
a
dominant
hop
start
to
have
a
nice
malt
flavor
in
the
middle
over
all
this
is
a
nice
drinking
brew
one
that
is
not
out
of
balance
and
one
that
i
feel
would
be
a
great
session
brew

yessir
this

really

a

this
could
be
the

that
i
actually
really
like
the
uk
and
an
ipa
who
knew

slightly
slick
good
drinkability
overall
who
would
have
thought
the
scots
could
make
such
a
nancy
tasting
mellow
englishstyle
fruity
ipa
its
easy
drinking
and
tasty
but
the
fizzy
palate
ruins
the
whole
experience
kinda
reminds
me
of
all
the
peppy
annoying
fat
high
school
girls
i
knew
that
smelled
like
fruity
crap
comparable
to
sniffing
girls
panties
always
an
interesting
proposition
i
feel
dirty
i
need
a
rauchbier
poured
from
a

that
i
assume
are
dating
but
cannot
interpret

a
good

fingers

that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
constant
thin
head
good
lacing
throughout
smell
was
hard
to
pin
down
when
first
poured
i
got
a
citrusy
smell
with
hints
of
lavender
but
as
the
beer
warmed
the
overall
smell
faded
to
a
nondistinct
light
malt
smell
the
mouthfeel
was
awesome
very
creamy
and
full
bodied
ipas
have
not
been
my
style
in
the
past
but
have
been
growing
into
the
style
lately
and
could
see
this
in
my
semi
regular
rotation

very

drink
it
is
a
fantastic
beer
it
was
an
ipa
all
right
but
it
had
that
distinctive
scottish
quality
wherein
the
hoppiness
is
subtle
but
at
the
same
time
pervasive
i
am
already
looking
forward
to
my
next

good

pleasant
biscuity

bitterness

much
more
balanced
than
an
american

the
bitterness
appears
mild
until
the
finish

it
really
pushes
forward
and
lingers
malt
kicks
things
off

fades

id
get
this

again
this
would
be
a

i
might
grab
a

more
bottles
very
drinkable
pleasant
clean

refreshingly
bitter
ipa
very
sessionable
and
conceals
its
alcohol
content
very
well
would
be
a

and
would
make
decent

and
serve
as
a
great
introduction
to
its
bigger
and
bolder
us
cousin
the
american
ipa
d
im
enjoying
the
fresh
hoppiness
of
this
one
sometimes
ipas
esp
english
style
seem
to
come
off
as
bitter
without
a
aromatic

presence
but
not
this
one
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
with
a
bubbly
off
white
head
that
laces
quite
well
aroma
is
a
blast
of

and
grapefruit
there
is
an
earthy
smell

well
almost
like
a
hidden

barely
there
though
taste
was
one
that
would
make
british
troops
smile
in
india
ages
ago
plenty
of
grapefruity
hops
some
bittersweet
chocolate
sourish
malt
and
a
huge
lengthy
dry
hoppy
finish
sharp
peppery
carbonation
not
overpowering
and
contributes
to
its
refreshing
character
the
relatively
high
abv
is
very
well
hidden
this
is
the
best
belhaven
beer
ive
had
for
sure
the
scots
have
always
been
stingy
on
the
hops
they
dont
grow
there
and
historically
they
were
taxed
heavily
so
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
very
nice
and
balanced
everything
matches
the
hops
the
malts
the
abv
carbonation
even
the
price
would
drink
consistently
and
goes
down
easy
poured
a
crystal
clear
golden
color

proved
to
be
fairly
long

is
fairly
mild
with
a
bit
of
piney

notes
and
some
breadlike
malt
also
present
taste
is
dominated
by
a
strong
hop
bitterness
tempered
by
a
light
sweet
fruitiness
the
ending
is
more
of
the
dry
hoppiness
and
is
a
nice
finish
for
this
beer
nice
and
drinkable
but
the
big
bottle
starts
to
get
a
bit
boring
this
is
a
good
rendition
of
an
american
pacific

apa
and
fanciers
of
that

the

smooth
leaving
a

and
its

quite
nice
with
good
usage
of
the
hops
one
that
i
may
revisit
at
some
point
d
easy

drink
but
not
the
first
beer
i
would
order
medium

aroma

kind
of
crazy
a
good
amount
of
hops
then
a
honey

taste
followed
by
a
strange
plasticlike
aftertaste
that
i
couldnt
place
the
aftertaste
is
the
worst
part
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
so
good
that
i
can
overlook
this
very
drinkable
not
too
heavy
and
very
interesting

different

i
would
probably
try
this

because
i
think
i
got
a
bad

but
this
one
was
not
very
good
wonderful
take
on
an
ipa
poured
a
slightly
murky
orange
color
with
a
thin
soft
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
behind
just
a
hint
of
lacing
low
to
moderate
level
of
carbonation
with
some
big
bubbles
covering
the
surface
aromas
of
earth
alcohol
mild
hops
and
juicy
fruit
come
to
mind
the
taste
is
wellbalanced
with
sweet
malt
fruit
flavors
balancing
the
soft
hop
finish
the
hops
are
soft
and
rather
mild
without
floral
or

aromas
or
flavors
suprisingly
creamy
and
textured
in
my
mouth
smooth
and
yet
crisp
pairing
nicely
with
my
pasta
in
a
spicy
tomato
sauce
flavorful
and
well
crafted
but
not
overly
unique
or
special
i
wasnt
interested
in
another
though
i
enjoyed
the
bottle
i
drank
last
swigs
apricot
and
dirt
a
tough
ipa
had
a
bad
bottle
that
is
not
reviewerd
hop
head
draght
dream
i
bought
a
bottle
after
reading
some
decent
reviews
i
poured
this
one
into
a
tulip
glass
and
it
had
a
very
nice
orangebrown
color
little
flecks
in
the
beer
reminded
me
of
floaties
not
a
good
start
the
smell
was
weird
and
i
could
not
quite
place
it
the
taste
was
so
bad
like
the
last
reviewer
said
it
was
medicinal
it
reminded
me
of
an
old
shoe
with
the
sole
lit
on
fire
and
melted
asphalt
poured
on
top
one
of
only
two
beers
i
have
ever
poured
down
the
drain
i
stupidly
purchased
two
bottles
so
now
how
do
i
get
rid
of
the
other
smooth
somewhat
oily
mouthfeel
with
light
carbonation
so
unlike
american
ipas
this
tastes
like
snapple
tea
just
as
it
smells
like
snapple
tea
no
detectable
hops
at
all
malts
arent
easy
to
discern
either
this
really
does
taste
like
tea
and
not
a
beer
at
all
a
decent
example
of
what
english
ipas
should
be
all
about
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
not
one
i
will
seek
out
copperydark
orange
beer
topped
with
a
gorgeous
frothy
off
white
head
unusually
for
a
british
ipa
i
can
actually
smell
the
aroma
especially
of
the
cascade
hops
spicy
and
light
grapefruit
some
good
malty
aromas
too
great
fruity
hoppiness
tingly
on
the
tongue
then
smooths
out
for
a
creamy
malty
finish
yet
the
excellent
hop
bitterness
persists
down
the
throat
and
in
the
after
taste
for
quite
a
while
very
livelly
taste
a
zing
and
a
great
boost
to
the
drinkability
i
liked
this
a
lot
a
great
american
style
ipa
with
a
delectable
british
feeling
well
done
belhaven
still
it
wasnt
completely
unpleasant
not
my
first
choice
for
this
style
but
drinkable
and
refreshing
enough
this
is
a
nice
english
ipa
and
seems
like
they
are
leaning
in
the
direction
of
an
american
ipa
with
the
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
and
medium
bodied
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
very
very
pleasant
surprise
and
at
only
2
29
at
peabodys
an
absolute
steal
very
easy
to
drink
not
overly
hoppy
id
suggest
this
to
someone
who
may
be
new
to
the
ipas
or
to
anyone
who
enjoys
ipa
ill
definitely
be
drinking
this
one
again
the
taste
was
very
smooth
i
was
amazed
right
away
how
good
it
was
the
taste
was
biscuit
like
and
sweet
along
with
the
citrus
and
spice
flavors
along
with
some
earthy
and
grass
like
bitternesschallenger
hops
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
what
got
me
at
first
it
is
extremely
smooth
and
easy
to
enjoy
its
medium
bodied
and
full
of
taste
a
new
favorite
ipa
i
would
like
a
newer
bottle
of
this
scottish
import
before
giving
it
a
bad
name
good
carbonation
maybe
a
little
on
the
light
side
i
only
wish
i
had
bought
more
d
pretty
good
drinkability
the
malt
sweetness
may
wear
on
me
a
bit
though
paired
with
some
pipers
pub
shepards
pie
appears
a
clear
copper
light
off
white
head
leaves
fine
even
lace
with
thick
bands
of
evenly
coated
lace
aroma
contains
mild
funky
character
with
a
uk
tone
doughy
malts
and
an
air
of
piney
and
floral
hop
aromatics
with
a

wouldnt

dont

despite
one
of
the
coolest
bottles
ever
ive
read
about
burton
on
trent
ipa
and
the
recipe
and
this
beer
is
far
from
what
the
us
would
think
about
ipa
its
almost
belgian
like
but
not
a
fair
comparison
since
the
profile
is
so
unique
to
anything
ive
had
its
very
earthy
natural
with
a
lot
of
different
things
going
on
in
the
aroma
and
taste
the
yeast
seems
to
be
huge
impact
on
this
beer
o
a
unique
beer
somewhere
between
a
berlinerwiesse
a
lambic
and
an
apa
worth
a
try
for
sure
british
beers
are
fun
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
a
homebrew
ipa
with
lots
of
yeast
flavor
much
better
malt
and
hop
presence
but
i
think
it
still
falls
short
of
my
expectations
sour
swallow
and
aftertaste
mimics
the
soured
milk
smell
the
body
is
rich
and
the
carbonation
is
low
which
i
like
overall
quite
a
lovely
beer
fairly
unique
compared
to
other
stuff
ive
had
definitely
getting
more

this

i
can

the

scent
and
taste
forces
me
to
sip
this
picked
this
up
at
the
biggest
beer
store
in
the
uk
beers
of
europe
ltd
hazy
orangeyellow
pour
with
a
huge
three
finger
soapy
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
really
sour
ciderlike
nose
that
is
like
no
other
british
ipa
ive
ever
had
the
taste
follows
suit
with
lots
of
grassy
bitter
acidic
qualities
that
had
me
thinking
i
was
drinking
a
cider
theres
a
subtle
malt
sweetness
that
bleeds
through
ever
so
slightly
but
the
sour
brett
overpowers
all
else
i
wasnt
sure
if
this
was
intentional
or
if
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
but
several
other
bas
had
the
same
experience
if
this
was
a
blind
review
i
would
bet
my
life
i
was
drinking
a
belgian
sour
this
is
the
strangest
ipa
ive
ever
had
o
this
is
a
bit
of
an
odd
beer
that
is
a
bit
too
cidery
and
the
alcohol
is
pretty
hot
with
only
the
faintest
of
malt
flavors
the
hops
are
only
really
bitterness
with
no
other
character
but
the
brett
does
shine
through
especially
as
the
beer
warms
there
are
more
flanders
red
characters
that
ipa
qualities
in
this
beer
very
different
and
tasty
loved
this
one
and
worth
finding
very
nontraditional
or
at
least
based
upon
what
weve
been
conditioned
to
drink
as
ipa
i
can
kind
of
understand
what
they
were
going
for
here
old
english
beers
were
supposed
to
have
a
little
funk
over
time
but
this
is
really
not
balanced
and
the
sour
and
bitter
really
fought
against
each
other
i
was
expecting
an
english
ipa
with
lots
of
east
kent
goldings
fuggles
and
challenger
hoppiness
but
got
a
big
bitter
lemony
sorachi
ace
type
flavor
was
not
pleasant
even
when
i
tried
to
consider
it
a
belgian
sour
or
saison
just
unbalanced
im
not
interested
in
trying
this
beer
again
this
beer
pours
a
gusher
couldnt
pour
it
all
at
once
a
slighlty
hazy
yellow
orange
color
the
smell
is
a
perfect
mix
of
vanilla
malt
shake
and
green
olives
with
some
blue
cheese
as
well
the
taste
is
interesting
to
say
the
least
there
is
some
nice
vanilla
whiskey
like
notes
no
doubt
from
the
oak
bitterness
seems
to
come
more
from
the
alcohol
then
the
hops
this
actually
reminds
me
of
a
bourbon
more
then
likely
because
of
the
woodyoak
like
notes
has
a
strange
green
olive
like
taste
as
well
mouthfeel
is
light
and
highly
carbonated
a
strange
beer
but
the
taste
is
intriguing
and
i
find
myself
taking
more
sips
not
because
it
is
good
just
interesting
all
in
all
im
glad
this
style
today
isnt
reminiscent
of
the
past
mouthfeel
is
lightly
spritzy
and
carbonation
is
appropriate
overall
a
decent
beer
probably
amazing
on
cask
in
england
but
average
here
and
now
because
the
freshness
is
clearly
a
factor
this
is
a
decent
brett
ipa
overall
although
im
not
sure
whether
they
were
intending
it
to
be
one
or
not
i
think
im
going
to
file
this
one
in
the
wtf
file
for
now
im
not
going
to
lie
though
it
kept
me
drinking
it
very
drinkable
look
forward
to
coming
back
for
more
however
reading
some
of
the
low
reviews
it
seems
like
this
beer
has
a
storage
and
travel
problem
as
the
bad
reviews
almost
certainly
had
an
outdated
bottle
from
what
they
are
describing
definitely
a
beer
that
i
believe
would
be
amazing
really
fresh
im
pretty
sure
i
got
a
good
bottle
from
one
of
my
local
haunts
although
i
did
not
see
a
date
or
batch
number
anywhere
this
is
ok
in
the
drinkability
area
but
the
taste
is
all
over
the
placei
did
not
expect
the
strong
clove
and
herbal
flavors
remember
if
you
like
your
beer
bright
pour
carefully
leaving
the
yeast
in
the
bottle
the
body
is
full
drinkability
is
high
what
can
i
say
d
although
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
english
ipas
this
one
is
excellent
drinkable
d
this
is
a
delightfully
easy
drinking
beer
which
im
glad
i
tried
its
one
that
i
think
bas
could
use
to
convert
bmc
drinkers
if
youre
looking
for
a
more
flavorful
alternative
to
sam
smiths
pale
ale
look
no
further
i
liked
this
beer
well
enough
and
would
happily
drink
another
but
for
the
gravity
in
it

abv
there
are
a
lot
of
other
much
better
beers
with
more
complex
and
richer
malts
this
beer
was
a
big
surprise
for
me
as
i
picked
it
up
out
of
the
reduced
section
at
my
local
store
was
on
sale
for
12
off
so
i
figured
why
not
and
was
very
happy
i
did
as
this
is
one
of
the
better
eipas
ive
tasted
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
poured

that
hangs

with

aroma
great

between

really
easy
going
down
with

an

f
pretty
bitter
a
very
slight
diacetyl
some
creamy
and
woody
esthers
a
slight
unpleasant
bitterness
on
the
finish
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
semi
dry
as
well
at
first
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
in
fact
i
was
pretty
disappointed
but
the
more
i
drank
this
and
the
more
it
warmed
from
fridge
temps
the
more
i
enjoyed
it
and
the
more
it
opened
up
this
is
really
a
real
ale
like
beer
that
needs
to
be
more
warm
and
open
up
and
is
a
cask
beer
it
should
even
be
poured
from
the
cask
not
bottle
but
thats
the
only
way
i
can
get
it
ill
look
forward
to
trying
this
at
nerax
sometime

very
perfumy
floral

up

followed
by
a
touch
of
orange
jam
and
some
biscuity

as
well
as
a
good
amount
of
minerality
which
expresses
itself
as
a
rustic
kind
of
earthy
cellarish
smell
taste
is
proper
english
hop
with
only
a
hint
of
malt
shining
through
nice
bitter
finish
and
a
real
sense
of
terroir
from
the
quality
english
ingredients
familiar
to
their
part
of
the
world
mediumfull
body
that
is
very
soft
and
slick
at
the
same
time
very
nice
proper
english
ipa
my
only
advice
on
this
one
is
to
make
sure
it
is
as
fresh
as
possible
and
coming
from
a
reputable
source
that
handles
it
well
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
it
sounds
like
quite
a
few
mishandled
bottles
have
made
their
way
to
peoples
mugs
cheers
libation
over
all
really
quite
good
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
heavy
its
just
best
to
wait
for
it
to
settle
and
warm
anyways
its
good
to
have
a
quality
version
of
the
classic
english
ipa
ill
be
having
this
again
a
gentleman
of
an
ipa
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yelloworange
color
the
head
is
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
very
slowly
into
thick
lacing
this
is
one
nice
looking
ipa
the
aroma
is
of
lemon
orange
flowers
and
a
nice
wood
character
i
really
like
how
the
woods
is
there
but
does
not
by
an
means
overpower
or
distract
from
the
rest
of
the
aroma
the
taste
has
the
same
lemon
orange
and
flower
characteristics
of
the
aroma
the
wood
is
there
too
but
it
is
cut
through
by
the
a
sharp
piercing
bitterness
this
beer
has
got
to
be
on
the
high
end
of
bitterness
for
an
english
ipa
but
it
works
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
one
fine
ipa
that
i
would
love
to
see
in
six
pack
form
but
i
am
sure
i
would
drink
it
again
nonetheless
d
this
is
truly
what
british
ipa
should
taste
like
something
about
it
just
says
traditional
its
good
but
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
session
d
not
a
fan
of
the
sourtart
fruit
good
balance
as
per
the
style
and
interesting
complexity
for
an
ipa
way
too
much
diacetyl
for
my
liking
especially
toward
the
end
drinkability
this
beer
should
be
called
shitty
shitty
bang
bang
d
not
all
that
complex
but
still
quite
flavoursome
something
id
drink
again
i
forgot
how
the
english
got
down
right
when
conservative
hop
bills
and
balanced
malt
seemed
redundant
a
spritzy
bitter
ale
shocks
the
scene
and
has
been
for
a
long
time
now
the
appearance
is
gorgeous
dense
foamy
head
atop
a
murky
amber
body
bits
of
yeast
and
sediment
dance
around
the
potent
carbonation
and
the
tongue
recieves
a
bit
of
a
sting
from
the
crispness
sour
and
tangy
at
times
with
high
pitch
bitter
notes
and
a
soft
malt
foundation
a
different
breed
from
the
piney
american
ipas
this
one
is
a
spritzy
lemoney
cocktail
complete
with
lime
and
tonic
thist
quenching
witha
pucker
a
jolly
good
historic
rendition
pours
a
cloudy
pinkish
orange
under
a
one
finger
beige
head
with
fairly
large
bubbles
that
pop
rather
quickly
leaving
thick
film
and
a
few
spots
of
lace
the
nose
is
strong
of
grapefruit
and
carnation
with
a
good
dose
of
sweet
bread
behind
the
mouth
is
too
light
and
very
prickly
lovely
taste
starting
out
grapefruit
bittersweet
with
a
touch
of

by

this
is

the
dregs
into
a
keg
of
homebrewed
old
ale
maybe
the
brett
will
dry
it
out
a
little
before
the
alcohol
content
kills
them
so
if
youre
a
homebrewer
you
get
a
sample
of
wild
yeast
in
addition
to
a
fine
beverage
in
an
almost
antique
style
this
is
the
first
beer
in
roger
protzs
300
beers
to
drink
before
you
die
book
poured
nicely
into
my
glass
a
deep
golden
honey
color
with
a
mighty
head
about
three
fingers
thick
tight
crisp
bubbles
gave
this
beer
something
of
a
champagne
feel
at
first
the
first
taste
is
interesting
lots
of
oak
and
citrus
hops
seem
to
dominate
the
beer
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
remind
me
of
cantillon
iris
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
true
to
the
english
ipa
style
although
i
liked
three
floyds
blackheart
better
worth
a
try
if
not
for
the
history
alone
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
good
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
theres
a
bit
more
strength
in
this
one
than
most
eipas
but
there
are
definitely
many
others
that
i
would
pick
over
this
one
i
will
assume
that
this
was
bad
and
will
try
it
again
but
not
for
a
while
drinkability
is
decent
the
funkyness
creeps
up
on
the
palate
and
creates
a
dry
mouthfeel
and
a
tart
aftertaste
unique
for
an
ipa
to
say
the
least
with
a
questionable
overall
character
great
thing
that
i
did
this
beer
is
wonderful
this
baby
is
a
full
bodied
bottle
conditioned
floral
and
hoppy
pale
ale
it
is
listed
as
a
pale
but
is
closer
to
ipa
in
style
it
has
a
orangish
amber
opaque
color
with
an
aroma
that
is
more
up
front
fruit
than
floral
the
taste
is
all
malt
and
hops
and
yeast
beautiful
to
look
at
and
taste
if
you
havent
had
it
yet
give
it
a
try
it
is
good
beer
tasty
stuff
but
that
carbonation
is
a
bitch
needless
to
say
the
second
glass
was
much
better
after
the
carbonation
had
calmed
down
a
bit
overall
a
pretty
average
and
slightly
odd
ipa
maybe
worth
a
try
once
md
the
texture
is
so
smooth
but
never
short
of
decent
and
healthy
dose
of
soft
carbonation
rendering
a
rich
but
quiet
malty
body
balanced
by
generous
amounts
of
english
hops
very
little
trace
of
alcohol
is
detected
on
the
palate
making
this
strong
ale
even
quaffable
im
not
familiar
with
the
really
traditional
type
of
english
ipa
but
this
balanced
and
gentle
interpretation
is
surely
inviting
pours
goodlooking
cloudy
tan
with
very
strong
carbonation
and
a
few
fingers
of
sticky
foam
smells
powerfully
woody
and
fruity
with
tangy
alcohol
and
sweet
pink
grapefruit
notes
the
flavor
is
significantly
drier
more
grainy
and
woody
in
character
the
sugary
grapefruit
center
is
balanced
by
toasted
malt
at
the
edges
finishes
with
a
parched
alcohol
sharpness
that
suggests
barrelaged
whiskey
the
mediumrich
body
is
somewhat
oily
and
overcarbonated
for
something
this
strong
drinks
like
a
much
larger
beer
than
the
labeled
alcoholbyvolume
would
lead
you
to
believe
an
odd
but
tasty
duck
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
not
watery
carbonation
is
solid
very
dry
for
the
abv
drinkability
is
hurt
by
the
phenols
and
some
fusels
as
it
warms
drinks
easy
for
the
abv
wished
the
hops
or
malt
stuck
out
a
bit
more
but
a
solid
effort
this
is
probably
much
better
on
cask
im
betting
d
the
smell
was
the
only
slight
letdown
other
than
that
very
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
d
fair
drinkability
would
be
better
if
the
smell
was
not
quite
so
all
over
the
place
overall
a
favorite
among
a
few
of
the
muggers
at
my
pub
and
rightfully
so
good
solid
english
ipa
that
would
be
a
pleasure
drinking
all
day
i
dont
believe
this
is
an
off
beer
i
just
think
it
is
the
way
the
brewer
made
it
really
nothing
i
would
ever
consider
buying
again
unless
i
had
a
certified
letter
from
the
brewer
saying
my
money
would
be
well
spent
this
time
around
not
the
best
depiction
of
the
style
that
ive
come
across
but
an
interesting
sample
nonetheless
big
ol
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
copper
hue
quite
dark
copper
nice
2
finger
tan
frothy
head
great
lacing
this
brew
has
a
very
complex
nose
that
i
wasnt
expecting
spicy
sweet
cinnamon
the
taste
is
a
really
spicy
malt
and
then
hops
stop
in
to
say
a
quick
hello
tastes
like
faint
cinnamon
also
quite
different
but
i
like
it
wish
i
had
another
bottle
to
decipher
it
further
im
really
liking
it
although
i
do
think
it
is
a
bit
odd
i
will
definitely
buy
more
of
these
a
very
complex
beer
worth
pondering
as
it
warms
in
your
glass
i
could
drink
casefulls
of
this
stuff
very
refreshing
for
its
strength
and
worthy
of
some
fine
well
aged
cheese

2
bottles
i
purchased
in
madison
werent
similar
at
all
to
my
first
review
hoping
they
were
just
old
and
that
the
funky
spice
shows
up
in

bottles

2
hit
or
miss
with
this
one
ive
had
one
tasty
one
and
two
soso
bottles
from
the
same
place
same
purchase
seems
theres
alot
of
variability
with
this
but
ill
continue
to
drink
it
because
when
its
good
its
a
really
captivating
beer
pretty
similar
to
wild
devil
overall
although
other
reviewers
dont
think
as
highly
of
this
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
english
ipas
ive
had
complex
but
very
drinkable
hoppy
but
still
balanced
with
malt
sweetness
this
is
what
i
think
of
when
i
imagine
the
style
d
for
some
reason
this
feels
like
it
would
be
closer
to
its
eipa
predecessors
but
it
has
a
flavor
profile
that
mostly
feels
rushed
on
the
tongue
while
i
do
enjoy
the
more
nuanced
and
gentler
nature
of
an
english
ipa
this
one
didnt
seem
to
quite
hit
the
mark
on
the
palate
overall
refreshing
but
not
particularly
impressive
the
punch
of
floral
hops
begins
to
wear
out
its
welcome
about
13
the
way
through
the
glass
it
is
a
taste
i
really
enjoy
but
not
so
much
in
this
high
volume
which
i
never
realized
until
i
had
this
beer
with
some
things
less
really
is
more
this
all
blended
to
a
long
smooth
and
thirst
quenching
finish
one
of
the
better
english
beers
ive
had
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
would
purchase
again
overall
a
decent
beer
but
too
fruity
and
fizzy
for
my
tastes
i
really
enjoy
it
but
would
haste
to
point
out
the
fuller
body
and
high
alcohol
as
opposed
to
an
oilier
peppery
hop
dominated
ale
keep
an
open
mind
and
think
about
the
historical
role
of
this
style
bottle
courtesy
of
hogtownharry
poured
a
medium
cloudy
yellowbeige
color
ale
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
english
dry
hops
with
a
floral
component
is
dominating
and
quite
enjoyable
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
malt
that
is
quite
dry
as
well
as
a
hoppy
finish
with
a
dry
aftertaste
body
is
above
average
with
low
filtration
and
low
carbonation
i
have
really
been
digging
the
english
hops
lately
and
this
was
very
rewarding
an
ipa
in
the
raw
cant
say
im
crazy
about
it
but
worth
trying
for
historical
reasons
and
to
try
a
beer
that
is
different
than
most
modern
ipas
hmmm
a
lot
going
on
in
this
brew
its
a
gusher
straight
from
the
bottle
after
cleaning
up
the
counter
the
floor
and
my
dog
the
beer
poured
a
well
headed
creamy
looking
orange
copper
hue
with
a
weizentype
haze
obviously
bottle
conditioned
evident
with
the
sprinkles
of
yeast
and
hops
swirling
around
the
aromas
are
a
highly
phenolic
and
estery
scent
with
bold
earthy
hops
and
a
firm
malt
base
the
flavors
are
a
forced
fruitiness
peaches
pineapples
pears
and
appricots
along
with
a
strong
alcohol
plastic
flavor
the
hop
flavors
are
present
and
offset
the
heavy
malts
well
but
never
really
round
out
the
flavors
properly
the
feel
is
a
firm
weightedness
from
the
malts
along
with
a
prickle
from
the
carbonation
and
alcohols
finishes
with
strong
hops
plastics
and
malts
just
seems
that
the
beer
was
fermented
at
way
too
high
of
temperature
not
a
bad
beer
but
one
that
i
will
not
likely
try
again
not
what
i
expected
from
england
but
then
again
an
attractive
flowery
live
ale
but
i
probably
would
only
reccommend
it
for
beer
education
probably
wont
go
back
to
it
empire
ipa
gets
a
hearty
wtf
from
me
but
strangely
enough
i
like
it
very
unique
expect
the
unexpected
good
good
strikingly
like
orval
with
a
soft
ipa
flare
id
like
to
try
the
two
side
by
side
now
murky
yellowdark
yellow
body
with
three
or
four
finger
thick
white
head
smells
skunky
initially
which
would
make
sense
with
the
importing
and
the
amount
of
hops
but
seems
to
wear
off
hopefully
this
one
wont
be
skunked
and
theres
a
light
sweet
scent
with
a
hint
of
hops
a
little
skunk
in
the
taste
without
the
skunk
theres
a
fair
bit
of
malt
fruitiness
too
perhaps
with
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
while
it
would
be
so
much
better
if
it
did
not
have
that
skunk
factor
this
would
be
far
and
away
one
of
the
best
ipas
i
have
ever
ever
tried
the
nonskunked
flavors
are
fantastic
thus
i
give
it
a
higher
rating
than
the
product
i
have
in
front
of
me
really
earns
but
probably
lower
than
it
would
be
fresh
if
you
can
find
this
on
tap
or
fresh
somewhere
get

a

very
refreshing
with
a
clear
apricot
touch

it
could
be
some

hoppy

normal

its
does
not
have

kick
though
it
needs
more
bitterness
and
more
hoppy
taste
to
make
it
better
the
mouth
is
dry
and
spritzy
for
the
style
but
i
consider
this
a
bonus
the
only
drawback
to
this
beers
drinkability
is
having
to
wait
for
it
to
settle
down
other
than
that
good
beer1
i
can
see
how
the
american
styles
evolved
from
a
brew
like
this
poured
with
good
head
clouded
amber
in
colour
british
water
gives
a
lot
away
very
quickly
a
rotting
wheat

aroma
smelt
more
odd
than
description
sounds
weird
bready
staleness
in
mouthfeel
with
alcohol
all
too
present
a
great
aftertaste
with
surprinsgly
clean
finish
but
with
a
very
harsh
mineralness
a
little
distasteful
to
me
bad
malt
profile
no
aroma
weird
and
off
centered
lacking
in
balance
i
seem
to
dislike
everything
i
could
find
in
this
beer
but
id
consider
the
thought
that
maybe
there
is
more
to
it
i
am
missing
will
probably
revist
a
burton
again
thanks
harry
for
the
sample
da
medium
i
could
do
one
or
two
bottles
of
burton
bridge
ipa
nice
medium
bodied
beer
but
way
too
much
carbonation
a
real
burpfest
here
much
improved
by
getting
the
foam
stirred
up
for
a
while
drinkability
suffers
because
of
the
bubbly
and
obvious
alcohol
the
beer
is
actually
pretty
decent
and
an
interesting
experiment
by
burton
bridge
to
make
a
recreation
of
what
the
original
ipas
were
like
not
sure
they
would
have
been
so
highly
carbonated
and
it
could
use
more
bittering
hop
a
little
diappointing
as
this
could
easily
with
a
little
tweaking
be
a
great
ipa
retention
well
you
couldnt
get
rid
of
the
head
if
you
tried
fruit
aromas
dominate
apples
diacetyl
and
hints
of
yeast
the
flavor
is
very
hoppy
but
not
a
typical
hop
they
take
on
a
fruity
character
apples
and
wood
like
flavors
are
sharp
on
the
tongue
grainy
malts
and
alcohol
sweetness
dry
hoppy
aftertaste
this
is
a
truely
english
ipa
it
is
a
great
switch
up
from
the
everyday
hoppy
ipa
in
america
it
is
called
an
ipa
but
it
doesnt
have
the
hoppiness
of
the
ipa
standard
this
is
not
to
say
it
is
bad
just
hard
to
classify
light
in
color
seriously
funky
aroma
perhaps
its
the
yeast
the
oak
aging
or
the
sulfur
content
in
the
water
with
hints
of
wood
horseblanket
salt
and
citrus
fruits
its
interesting
to
taste
this
knowing
that
this
is
very
similar
to
what
the
english
troops
received
in
india
historical
the
funkiness
continues
upon
tasting
nice
woody
funky
tartness
along
with
a
well
hopped
profile
grapefruit
lemon
and
a
nice
biscuitlike
slightly
toasted
caramel
malt
flavor
in
the
backround
notes
of
vanilla
are
present
as
well
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
brew
this
beer
might
get
a
tad
sour
after
a
while
and
doesnt
finish
quite
as
cleanly
as
most
pas
alot
more
lingering
astringency
which
negatively
affects
the
drinkability
a
bit
though
not
the
quality
over
the
long
haul
i
dont
think
itd
drink
as
well
as
some
cleaner
pas
but
that
doesnt
mean
you
couldnt
sit
down
with
it
all
night
drinkability
is
goodbutnotgreat
overall
though
this
is
some
really
tasty
beer
i
will
definitely
be
buying
it
again
beer
is
good
happy
unexpected
beering
drinkability
while
i
recognize
the
distinctness
and
historical
aspects
of
the
style
i
cannot
say
this
is
a
beer
i
intend
to
try
again
its
just
too
lemony
and
sulfuric
to
satisfy
my
palate
pretty
nice
ipa
the
pour
is
murky
orangecrazily
carbonated
huge
foam
takes
forever
to
settle
i
guess
it
must
still
be
nice
and
fresh
considering
i
bought
it
about
a
month
ago
thanks
nick
at
bauer
for
keeping
your
beers
in
top
condition
i
think
this
is
a
fine
example
of
what
the
original
ipas
were
like
hoppy
piney
skunky
citrusy
hops
both
on
the
nose
and
tongue
but
delivered
in
a
fairly
subtle
manner
smooth
mouthfeel
and
an
extremely
misleading
potency
make
this
thing
quite
drinkable
but
dangerous
i
want
ploughmans
lunch
now
to
soak
up
some
of
the
7
abv
i
will
seek
this
one
out
again
as
long
as
i
know
its
fresh
pours
a
magnificent
burnt
orange
with
an
incredible
off
white
head
that
retains
excellently
truly
a
looker
the
aroma
is
also
nice
with
a
big
fruit
character
upfront
tangerine
lemon
apples
kiwi
and
passion
fruit
some
citrusy
and
floral
hops
biscuit
and
toasted
bread
and
some
ethanol
the
flavor
retains
the
intense
fruit
character
apples
tangerines
lemon
rind
passionfruit
lime
as
well
as
some
nice
citrus
and
floral
hops
that
shine
but
dont
overwhelm
toasted
bread
slight
sour
citrus
edge
and
moderate
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
chewy
with
light
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
descent
but
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
and
warming
an
interesting
complex
and
tasty
ipa
supposedly
the
original
ipa
and
i
can
see
why
it
wasis
so
popular
nice
aftertastesome

not
very
complex

amber
with
a
long
lasting
loose
off
white
head
leaving
loads
of
thick
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
mildly
of
hops
glorious
hops
this
is
a
full
flavor
quite
hoppy
brew
nice
to
see
a
british
brewery
makes
a
beer
with
more
then
a
delicate
amount
of
hoppy
character
this
one
has
character
and
complexity
perhaps
the
low
ratings
have
to
do
with
folks
not
getting
a
fresh
bottle
and
shelf
life
issues
with
what
appears
to
be
an
authentic
caskbottle
conditioned
ale
at
any
rate
i
truly
enjoyed
the
bottle
i
sampled
get
a
fresh
one
and
enjoy
a
bold
and
hoppy
brew
with
better
then
average
flavor
and
character
decanted
a
500
ml
bottle
into
a
pitcher
and
then
into
the
glass
pours
a
dull
orange
with
a
monstrous
offwhite
head
and
excellent
retention
nose
is
pretty
sweet
fruity
and
a
little
tart
for
an
ipa
although
some
grapefruit
hops
notes
do
come
through
taste
has
the
big
hop
kick
i
expect
from
an
ipa
but
a
lot
else
going
on
as
well
oranges
grape
soy
sauce
iced
tea
sweet
tartsall
sorts
of
funky
tastes
coming
through
on
this
one
finish
is
extremely
dry
medium
bodied
and
with
a
low
carbonation
level
remiscient
of
a
cask
conditioned
ale
this
is
a
really
interesting
beerlike
a
cross
between
an
ipa
and
a
belgian
pale
not
a
session
beer
by
any
stretch
but
this
is
my
far
the
most
interesting
english
ipa
ive
had
and
well
worth
trying
once
i
ordered
this
upon
the
waitress
recommendation
the
beer
pours
out
orange
in
color
with
a
big
frothy
head
the
aroma
is
nice
and
citrusy
but
you
can
definitely
detect
the
malts
as
well
the
flavor
is
loaded
with
hops
a
hop
bitterness
explosion
as
i
would
call
it
you
can
still
taste
the
citrus
but
the
bitterness
just
numbs
your
palate
this
was
definitely
an
interesting
beer
different
from
any
other
english
ipa
ive
had
before
but
not
great
by
any
means
the
mouthfeel
is
lively
sharp
and
refershing
i
enjoyed
this
one
drinkability

the
fizzy
carbonation
kept
this
from
going
down
well
but
its
a
nice
example
of
the
style
organic
hops
dominate
the
flavor
everything
else
comes
in
on
the
back
and
they
rush
at
you
as
if
in
desperation
citrus
and
yeast
jump
in
there
for
a
nice
wet
finish
leaving
a
dry
aftertaste
nice
500ml
into
duvel
glass
initially
light
gushing
despite
the
bottle
not
having
moved
since
months
a
whole
bed
of
sediments
lie
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
head
is
at
first
huge
frothy
but
slowly
diminishes
to
an
offwhite
cover
color
is
a
deep
murky
orange
sand
nice
color
really
seems
to
have
reflects
of
red
and
brown
the
sediments
change
the
light
reflection
constantly
from
the
glass
come
powerful
funky
aromas
you
could
almost
believe
brett
was
thrown
in
and
this
becomes
even
more
apparent
as
it
warms
big
yeasty
and
fruity
orange
mint

even
woody

lingering
earthiness
sandlike
almost
smoky
decent

background
citrusy

the
tongue
tart
with
those
generous
drying
out
orange
flavors
funky
leather
hay
and
delicious
flavor
development
containing
a
warming
kiss
of
alcohol
as
it
warms
ive
never
had
something
this
uniquely
yeasty
from
england
moderately
high
carbonation
round
powdery
mediumfull
body
quite
salty
toward
the
end
the
finish
may
be
the
only
point
that
left
me
wanting
more
while
its
long
and
fruity
whatever
hops
they
used
styrian
golding
almost
give
it
a
cardboardy
feel
the
way
it
combines
with
the
yeasty
and
fruity
acidity
awesome
ultimate
proof
that
bottled
english
ales
ought
to
be
mandatory

this
could
be

poured
a

around

a

malts
flavor
malty
hints
of
orange

alcohol
with
a
slight
sour
finish
not
to
bad
of
a
beer
this
one
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
head
the
nose
does
not
say
pale
ale
of
any
variety
to
me
it
smells
very
much
like
a
balgian
tart
like
a
flanders
red
the
flavor
is
the
same
as
the
nose
not
what
i
expected
from
the
beer
the
sour
and
tart
flavors
were
not
from
hops
as
i
had
expected
but
almost
puckered
my
cheeks
the
feel
was
moderate
at
best
i
liked
the
beer
but
not
what
i
would
want
from
the
style
half
a
liter
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
medium
orange
color
with
one
finger
of
head
the
smell
is
sweet
and
spicy
almost
tart
and
a
little
funky
the
taste
is
fairly
bitter
but
not
in
a
hop
bitterness
way
i
cant
find
much
hops
in
this
one
anyway
the
body
is
a
little
thin
and
watery
the
drinkability
is
just
there
as
well
eh
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
doesnt
have
great
retention
the
aroma
was
hoppy
with
some
fruit
notes
but
it
also
has
a
certain
sourness
the
flavor
was
hoppybitter
but
had
a
strange
sourness
about
it
very
strange
finishes
slightly
bitter
moderate
body
and
medium
drinkability
not
sure
how
well
this
one
fits
the
style
500ml

with
an
eggshell

rocky
dense

quite
inviting

in
my
20oz

the
aroma
greets
me
with
an
alluring
sweet
malt
fruity
subdued
yeast
and
citrus
hop
bouquet
the
head
is
persistent
the
flavor
is
a
mild
blend
of
the
various

components
in
addition
to
some
lovely
fruity
notes
of
nearly
ripe
pear
peach
and
grape
orange

citrus
hops
finish
it
off
elements

warm
but
are
reserved
enough
not
to
offend
mouthfeel
is

pleasant
mellows
out
as
it
comes
closer
to

temperature
quite
a
nice
beer
the
beer
after
its
release
from
the
500ml
brown
bottle
sets
in
the
glass
a
turbid
orangeamber
color
the
head
miniscule
in
size
bubbly
in
texture
and
the
color
a
light
tan
and
it
vanishes
in
the
wink
of
eye
the
lace
forms
a
very
thin
sheet
that
somewhat
obscures
the
glass
nose
has
a
bit
of
yeast
lightly
sweet
musty
would
be
a
good
description
the
start
is
lightly
sweet
fair
malt
presence
with
the
top
cadaverous
finish
is
light
in
carbonation
the
hops
light
weight
in
their
spiciness
aftertaste
is
desert
bone
dry
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
7
5
percent
abv
cant
say
it
pleases
me
much
sampled
it
twice
as
i
thought
the
first
bottle
bad
sure
the
hell
different
from
most
english
ales
get
up
and
dance
cloudy
yellow
amber
with
a
booming
white
head
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
foamer
banana
bread
and
a
bit
of
evergreen
this
is
fairly
malty
and
the
big
esters
give
it
a
bit
of
uniqueness
but
it
could
really
use
more
hops
to
really
be
an
ipa
its
pretty
bizarre
actually
thie
beer
pours
murkycloudy
amber
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
fades
into
wisps
of
white
across
the
top
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
mainly
of
yeast
with
a
little
bit
of
citrus
and
the
beer
tastes
thick
and
yeasty
almost
like
a
bottlefermented
trappist
although
more
like
an
american
trappist
copy
there
is
really
little
hop
taste
in
this
beer
not
like
your
normal
ipa
instead
the
taste
is
mostly
of
sugar
and
yeast
with
a
thick
alcohol
bitterness
arriving
late
when
i
first
poured
this
i
thought
i
had
gotten
a
bad
bottle
it
pours
an
incredibly
murky
amber
frankly
it
looks
like
orange
marmalade
with
an
absolutely
enormous
tinted
head
which
easily
filled
56
of
my
glass
then
i
take
a
whiff
and
it
smells
strangespicy
sweet
like
a
cloved
barley
wine
what
the
so
i
checked
the
previous
reviews
something
i
ordinarily
try
not
to
do
nope
they
were
right
on
this
is
almost
a
belgian
masquerading
as
an
ipa
fortunately
i
like
belgians
well
enough
but
i
like
hops
even
more
so
i
have
to
say
that
for
an
ipa
this
is
a
disappointment
ok
shift
gears
this
is
still
a
worthy
enough
brew
i
got
to
tell
you
however
theres
enough
residue
in
the
bottle
to
offer
sufficient
ballast
for
the
entire
voyage
to
india
and
the
alcohol
is
quite
invasive
in
the
taste
i
could
find
no
hops
forewarned
is
forearmed
if
burton
bridge
empire
india
pale
ale
is
what
the
original
ipas
tasted
like
then
im
glad
that
american
craft
brewers
came
up
with
their
own
take
on
the
style
16
9
ounce
bottle
the
old
ipas
were
thought
to
have
perhaps
been
a
bit
sour
in
character
and
hopped
to
preserve
them
this
has
enough
of
that
lactobrett
character
to
be
authentic
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
too
thin
and
this
beer
lacks
a
wow
factor
but
its
by
no
means
bad
its
just
averagegood
really
pale
amber
color
with
an
absurdly
large
fluffy
head
this
beer
smelled
like
an
old
refrigerator
that
had
sat
unused
for
months
there
was
a
mild
aroma
of
old
oranges
the
taste
was
the
same
stale
funky
old
i
wonder
if
it
had
just
sat
too
long
at
the
package
store
usually
good
turnaround
there
though
as
one
other
reviewer
noted
british
ipas
tend
to
dissapoint
me
and
this
one
certainly
did
my
experiences
with
this
company
continue
to
be
onetime
affairs
sorry
to
say
an
interesting
beer
big
and
solid
with
hoppy
orchard
fruit
flavors
livening
things
up
while
the
grapefruitypiney
hops
of
the
pacific
northwest
are
still
my
favorite
this
is
an
entertaining
variation
this
pours
a
deep
orange
with
a
huge
sticky
orange
tinted
headaroma
is
of
orange
rind
and
slightly
geranium
like
i
got
a
hint
of
orange
and
mineral
right
off
the
bat
with
this
with
a
dryish
finish
this
a
kick
in
the
ass
ipa
for
sure
why
the
low
ratings
on
this
beer
i
think
it
is
a
very
well
made
beeri
guess
iam
just
different
this
is
an
oddball
ipa
it
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
an
overly
carbonated
head
and
nice
thick
trails
of
lace
the
aroma
is
yeasty
and
clovey
up
front
and
some
malt
and
spicy
hop
aroma
in
the
background
theres
a
sweet
malt
body
somewhere
but
it
seems
to
be
compromised
by
a
champaignlike
effervescence
the
grapefruit
lemon
zest
and
spicy
hop
bitterness
mingle
with
coriander
and
clovelike
flavors
the
alcohol
begins
to
reveal
itself
at
the
halfway
point
as
does
a
caramel
quality
i
continuously
upgraded
andor
downgraded
my
rating
of
this
brew
throughout
this
review
so
the
best
i
can
offer
is
this
is
a
must
try
because
of
all
the
crazy
angles
and
surprises
this
is
an
ipa
am
i
too
used
to
american
ipas
or
is
this
one
a
little
off
hazy
honey
color
with
an
orange
frothy
head
that
lingers
the
hop
profile
is
very
light
its
fresh
and
floral
but
it
is
overpowered
by
a
fruity
yeasty
doughey
sweet
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
round
and
creamy
but
the
flavor
is
off
to
me
couldnt
finish
the
glass
too
sweet
for
me
i
bought
this
hoping
to
discover
another
great
english
ipa
and
i
was
a
little
disappointed
first
i
crack
the
bottle
i
cant
help
but
take
a
quick
whiff
from
the
bottleughgross
this
beer
is
the
most
wretched
smelling
brew
i
have
ever
smelt
before
i
have
bottles
of
vinegar
that
smell
better
than
this
and
that
is
all
this
beer
smells
like
the
taste
is
average
at
best
with
a
moderate
hop
profile
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
maybe
this
is
a
bad
brew
because
my
stomach
is
already
upset
with
me
over
the
quarter
pint
i
have
consumed
the
rest
is
going
in
the
sink
id
really
like
to
try
this
again
i
dont
think
i
got
the
best
or
the
youngest
bottle
of
the
lot
but
until
ive
had
another
sample
my
decision
stands
this
was
undeniably
horrible
i
hate
nay
detest
pouring
out
beer
but
i
had
to
discard
at
least
18
ounces
of
this
stuff
its
funny
i
paid
only
4
for
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
my
life
rochefort
10
and
over
5
for
one
of
the
absolute
worst
variety
is
the
spice
of
life
huh
hurl
definately
a
good
beer
that
is
brewed
in
the
traditional
english
way
for
an
ipa
other
than
the
slightly
sour
smell
and
taste
an
well
rounded
beer
i
think
i
will
try
again
and
see
if
it
still
sour
this
turbo
charged
bastard
spewed
all
over
upon
opening
and
i
wasnt
happy
i
mean
it
blew
up
not
cool
anyway
its
a
cloudy
dark
copper
color
sort
ot
tea
like
huge
foamy
tan
and
orange
head
lots
of
fruity
aromas
pretty
fruity
and
sourish
upon
tasting
some
mustyrusty
characteristics
lots
of
hop
character
juicy
fruit
madness
way
less
malt
backbone
than
i
was
expecting
sort
of
seems
out
of
balance
pretty
smooth
refreshing
and
quenching
im
still
pissed
about
it
exploding
all
over
and
im
sure
that
took
away
from
the
overall
experience
would
i
buy
it
again
no
way
not
after
the
mess
i
made
was
it
a
good
beer
an
ok
one
there
are
much
better
examples
of
ipas
not
a
good
experience
from
an
average
beer
had
a
chance
to
discuss
the
bottling
problem
oh
well
i
just
wont
buy
anymore
bottles
it
comes
in
a
quaint
looking
16
9
oz
bottle
with
an
english
military
officer
and
a
cricket
player
on
the
label
the
bottle
however
may
be
the
highlight
of
the
experience
it
explodes
out
of
the
bottle
leaving
a
huge
billowy
white
head
that
takes
minutes
to
reduce
to
the
point
of
drinkability
its
a
murky
orangishbrown
with
lots
of
chunks
floating
around
in
it
the
smell
is
fruity
with
a
beglianlike
mustiness
to
it
a
lot
is
going
on
it
the
taste
but
it
just
seems
like
too
much
alcohol
astringency
is
quite
pronounced
leaving
the
taste
of
alcohol
lingering
in
the
mouth
this
is
certainly
not
a
subtle
beer
for
some
reason
this
left
me
feeling
like
it
was
something
that
might
have
been
brewed
during
prohibition
for
consumption
in
a
speakeasy
at
4
75
for
a
16
9
oz
bottle
i
wont
be
going
back
for
more
after
reading
the
other
reviews
i
wonder
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
this
beer
had
no
carbonation
looked
like
apple
cider
with
no
head
the
aroma
is
english
hops
fruity
and
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
also
definitely
british
fruity
estery
with
limited
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
too
flat
and
cidery
even
for
a
lower
carbonated
english
ale
all
in
all
i
hope
that
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
because
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
beer
charged
like
a
maniac
the
bottle
almost
exploded
on
opening
lots
of
head
even
4
minutes
later
very
hazy
orangebrown
color
with
some
yeast
chunks
citrus
rind
and
fruit
in
aroma
very
aggressively
hopped
if
this
was
made
with
cascades
it
would
be
too
much
as
it
is
its
still
surprisingly
astringent
for
a
u
k
i
p
a
malts
are
subdued
dont
impart
a
lot
of
balance
this
boy
is
a
mouth
wrangler
for
hop
lovers
i
enjoyed
it
as
refreshing
when
nothing
but
hops
will
do
but
prefer
many
others
verges
on
notable
alcohol
a
delicate
pour
still
produced
a
huge
foamy
head
that
took
a
long
time
to
diminish
very
fruity
aromas
with
some
sulfury
lemony
notes
its
tasted
much
the
same
as
it
smelled
fruity
slightly
grainy
sweetish
and
sulfury
with
the
slightly
bitter
hops
kicking
in
late
to
make
this
a
very
complex
and
interesting
drink
the
somewhat
thin
body
and
high
carbonation
levels
made
this
quite
spritzy
and
refreshing
almost
like
a
belgian
wit
but
fruitier
and
hoppier
definitely
not
your
average
ipa
notes
is
this
what
an
ipa
used
to
be
one
would
think
so
and
so
do
we
a
powerful
brew
that
could
withstand
any
voyage
this
brew
is
bottled
after
six
months
in
the
cask
which
adds
to
the
rustic
raw
character
this
beer
goes
over
the
top
with
its
pushy
fruity
esters
not
your
run
of
the
mill
modern
day
ipa
coppery
amber
color
mild
flowery
nose
nice
sweet
malt
taste
with
the
hop
bitterness
in
the
background
not
a
typical
west
coast
ipa
but
still
quite
interesting
not
sure
what
the
point
of
the
organic
certification
means
to
most
beer
drinkers
but
it
means
nothing
but
a
marketing
ploy
to
me
still
good
and
reasonably
priced
7
50
for
a
6pack
i
was
hoping
for
so
much
more
from
this
one
only
bright
spot
was
the
cost
i
only
paid
4
50
for
the
bomber
not
an
ipa
taste
more
like
a
lager
ps
would
you
really
be
that
worried
about
organic
after
ingesting
alcohol
for
hipsters
a
disappointing
offering
that
really
skimps
on
any
malt
character
onedimensional
hop
bitterness
with
very
little
aroma
is
another
bust
despite
decent
looks
and
feel
the
heart
and
soul
of
any
decent
beer
is
taste
and
aroma
this
beer
is
sadly
deficit
in
those
areas
a
decent
ipa
with
some
pine
and
orange
characteristics
overall
this
is
not
bad
as
in
drain
pour
its
just
not
as
good
as
other
ipas
i
have
tasted
i
have
been
looking
for
a
good
organic
beer
i
can
enjoy
everyday
and
this
failed
there
are
far
too
many
ipas
with
superior
flavor
that
i
would
much
rather
drink
d
not
a
great
beer
but
drinkable
and
was
actually
expecting
worse
here
didnt
really
strike
me
as
an
english
ipa
however
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
organic
brews
i
have
come
across
yet
not
sure
why
it
is
so
hard
to
make
a
good
organic
beer
but
i
applaud
eel
rivers
efforts
not
something
that
is
going
to
be
a
regular
although
worth
trying
o
a
really
good
beer
not
an
award
winning
ipa
but
a
really
tasty
beer
couldnt
taste
the
organic
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
earth
floral
and
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
zest
and
slight
herbal
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
has
a
better
hop
presence
in
the
aroma
in
my
opinion
kind
of
a
strange
brew
not
like
bob
and
doug
though
it
doesnt
smell
like
much
of
anything
kinda
yeasty
i
guess
no
hop
that
i
can
detect
taste
is
just
muted
a
little
hop
taste
bread
tobacco
maybe
just
not
a
good
choice
when
there
are
so
many
great
ipas
out
there
i
really
hate
to
not
recommend
a
beer
especially
when
brewers
put
their
heart
and
soul
into
their
craft
but
i
just
cannot
say
i
like
this
beer
overall
i
actually
think
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
at
all
what
i
expected
from
an
ipa
its
more
of
a
slightly
hoppy
belgian
wit
there
is
a
distinct
orange
flavor
with
a
little
hops
a
good
beer
but
for
the
style
not
at
all
what
i
would
be
looking
for
if
im
trying
to
drink
an
ipa
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
really
good
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
if
this
beer
were
a
woman
it
would
look
great
on
paper
nice
liitle
body
youd
have
no
problem
taking
her
around
you
friends
but
shes
not
very
interesting
and
youre
asking
the
waitress
what
else
in
on
tap
light
honey
color
clear
minimal
cream
head
ew
smells
kinda
funky
smells
like
alcohol
lots
and
some
citrus
tastes
of
maybe
soap
and
hops
citrus
perhaps
well
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
an
bubbly
at
least
not
impressed
i
knew
organic
was
a
mistake
well
overall
about
3
of
5
thats
being
generous
wouldnt
recommend
it
at
least
it
was
only
2
50
notes
im
not
sure
about
this
beer
ive
sure
had
better
7
2
abv
brutally
underrated
here
on
ba
it
pours
redish
and
clear
with
a
nice
two
inch
off
white
head
the
nose
is
aromatic
hops
to
the
max
sticky
and
red
and
west
coast
in
origin
they
are
sappy
and
rich
beautiful
the
flavor
is
about
the
same
a
little
too
sweet
before
the
bitter
which
is
a
minus
but
there
is
also
some
neat
red
malts
going
on
which
give
a
nice
depth
some
pine
and
some
fruit
dense
the
mouthfeel
is
thicker
maybe
too
much
so
but
the
carbonation
is
good
and
the
flavor
stays
in
my
mouth
forever
its
not
the
best
ipa
ever
but
there
is
a
lot
to
like
here
and
i
think
the
masses
have
been
too
harsh
with
this
one
it
is
organic
and
strong
and
pretty
solid
any
way
you
slice
it
ill
drink
it
again
gladly
the
beer
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
some
perfumelike
hop
notes
as
well
as
some
light
orange
citrus
the
flavor
is
a
nice
mix
of
orange
citrus
and
biscuit
malt
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
there
is
also
a
little
grapefruit
in
the
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
it
had
its
moments
the
look
and
smell
had
me
hooked
but
something
was
off
with
the
taste
taste
is
really
sweet
with
some
caramel
notes
turns
flat
pretty
quickly
and
not
much
going
on
there
are
some
decent
hop
notes
but
i
find
this
beer
to
be
pretty
average
and
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
o
i
would
never
get
this
again
though
i
appreciate
the
effort
to
go
organic
o
a
little
bit
too
malty
and
stale
for
my
tastes
but
not
an
unsatisfying
beer
not
that
all
ipas
need
to
be
hopbombs
but
theres
something
that
just
isnt
bright
enough
about
this
one
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
english
ipa
style
would
not
mind
having
this
one
again
another
i
bought
accidentally
again
212014
it
is
a
bit
easy
drinking
but
not
bad
ill
stick
with
my
review
this
was
an
odd
ipa
it
smelled
amazing
i
was
all
in
but
then
after
a
few
swallows
i
was
confused
the
flavor
to
me
is
backwards
the
hops
come
first
with
a
malty
finish
thats
underwhelming
i
think
ill
pass
in
the
future
overall
this
is
a
bit
of
an
underwhelming
beer
i
am
not
sure
i
would
classify
this
as
an
english
style
ipa
because
of
the
immense
citrus
but
it
is
definitely
not
a
strong
aipa
honestly
this
is
just
a
bit
onedimensional
this
beer
is
refreshing
but
really
just
weighs
in
at
average
for
me
update
had
this
beer
again
the
other
night
it
was
much
better
and
i
actually
liked
it
this
time
also
its
being
organic
makes
me
happy
o
avoid
this
beer
trying
the
ipa
from
eel
river
and
it
probably
should
be
renamed
imperial
malt
ale
cuz
thats
all
i
really
smell
and
taste
the
beer
poured
a
clear
copper
color
with
thin
white
head
the
smell
is
mostly
malt
not
alot
of
hops
the
taste
is
malty
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
overall
it
is
not
a
great
ipa
seems
more
like
an
amber
ale
o
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
eipa
dry
caramel
malt
character
minerally
yeastiness
firm
bitterness
and
a
medium
body
that
means
i
can
enjoy
several
in
a
session
o
not
impressed
with
this
at
all
first
beer
i
had
from
eel
river
so
i
need
to
try
others
but
this
one
is
a
big
miss
for
me
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
quite
smoothly
overall
i
expected
this
beer
to
be
disappointing
the
sale
rack
is
an
iffy
place
to
shop
and
the
first
impressions
werent
great
i
was
surprised
nice
bite
good
beer
pours
a
rich
copper
color
with
a
chill
haze
and
a
nice
soapy
froth
semi
sweet
nose
mildly
fruity
with
some
malt
poking
through
in
the
flavor
caramel
fruity
hops
berrymangocitrus
and
a
light
roasted
character
bitterness
is
adequate
for
the
style
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
modest
carbonation
and
a
smooth
overall
feel
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
fruity
ipa
which
was
alittle
unusual
but
not
bad
overall
a
terrible
beer
i
will
not
try
anything
else
by
this
brewery
most
likely
poured
from
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
generic
tulip
purchased
from
total
wine
in
charlotte
last
week
no
bottle
date
coppergold
on
color
small
head
with
no
retention
to
speak
of
aroma
is
a
very
offputting
rendition
of
rotting
vegetables
for
the
first
time
in
recent
memory
i
dont
want
to
taste
a
beer
i
really
dont
but
i
shall
taste
is
also
really
bad
kinda
like
liquid
socks
the
after
taste
is
also
poor
this
beer
doesnt
taste
like
an
english
ipa
or
any
other
type
of
ipa
if
there
was
ever
an
idea
of
watered
down
flavorless
ipa
this
has
got
to
be
it
gives
organic
beer
a
bad
name
real
bad
how
and
the
heck
can
you
release
something
this
horrible
tasting
is
beyond
me
ok
here
is
the
deal
with
eel
river
brews
the
only
way
to
enjoy
their
beer
is
on
tap
several
years
ago
i
was
the
assistant
brewer
and
there
are
a
lot
of
good
things
to
say
about
the
brewery
in
general
it
is
kept
scrupulously
clean
the
ingredients
are
of
extremely
high
quality
and
the
organic
standards
are
militantly
enforced
however
the
bottling
line
is
pretty
damn
outdated
and
presents
a
lot
of
opportunities
to
create
a
stale
oxidized
almost
undrinkable
product
try
two
bottles
of
the
same
beer
from
different
bottling
runs
i
can
just
about
guarantee
they
wont
taste
the
same
yes
this
place
makes
beer
toooo
heavy
on
the
malt
flavor
and
the
ipa
is
wildly
underhopped
the
acai
berry
brew
is
an
abomination
that
makes
baby
jesus
cry
but
the
hef
available
only
at
the
brewery
and
only
seasonally
is
truly
epic
and
the
imperial
stout
demands
respect
the
quality
of
the
beers
decreases
rapidly
with
distance
from
the
eel
river
and
the
smaller
the
bottle
the
worse
the
beer
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
but
there
are
other
eipas
that
i
would
pick
first
o
foul
drink
i
just
didnt
find
this
appealing
to
drink
finished
my
taster
had
some
water
a
couple
of
tasters
of
sculpin
and
was
happy
overall
good
tasting
seems
like
an
english
ipa
made
by
a
west
coast
brewer
that
really
did
their
best
to
restrain
the
hopping
fine
with
me
hops
kick
ass
overall
this
is
not
worth
checking
out
i
feel
like
they
thought
using
organic
ingredients
meant
the
recipe
only
needed
half
the
ingredients
overall
an
ok
beer
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
it
did
lift
my
thoughts
that
organic
beers
arent
that
good
gunna
try
a
couple
more
now
d
although
the
beer
starts
off
very
well
due
to
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
it
begins
to
lose
the
hoppy
quality
and
begins
to
taste
primarily
like
a
brown
ale
by
the
end
okay
i
guess
overall
im
very
regretful
to
buy
this
sixpack
color
pretty
but
not
an
ipa
color
maybe
a
15
on
the
srm
scale
d
i
dont
think
i
will
be
going
back
to
this
beer
for
the
price
and
organic
label
i
expected
a
fresh
tasting
ipa
and
it
missed
the
mark
for
me
i
didnt
hate
it
but
i
feel
like
its
just
not
for
me
served
from
22oz
bottle
despite
my
low
scores
props
need
to
go
to
eel
river
for
providing
widely
available
reasonably
priced
organic
beers
im
thinking
that
at
the
moment
their
priorities
may
be
focused
on
making
the
beer
organic
rather
than
making
it
the
best
beer
it
could
be
but
its
great
to
have
options
like
this
on
the
market
not
sure
how
the
organicness
affects
this
beer
again
not
bad
an
orangeish
copper
beer
pours
clear
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
and
lacing
citric
hops
are
appreciated
in
the
aroma
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
not
very
bitter
for
an
ipa
overall
not
a
bad
effort
but
like
most
of
this
breweries
beers
ipa
is
not
very
drinkable
the
bitterness
seems
a
bit
too
harsh
here
sharp
is
pretty
much
the
one
word
that
comes
to
mind
with
each
sip
and
it
eventually
affects
the
drinkability
dm
smooth
on
the
pallet
lack
of
nice
taste
notes
hurt
the
drinkability
slight
carbonation
tingle
bought
the
22oz
bomber
for
3
bucks
so
im
not
at
all
upset
as
a
side
note
i
notice
this
beer
gets
very
little
love
here
i
will
say
though
the
bad
reviews
are
generally
the
bottled
version
of
this
and
most
are
east
of
the
mississippi
like
many
ipas
they
are
better
when
drank
fresh
and
on
tap
theres
no
way
this
beer
deserves
when
drank
fresh
a
c
as
many
of
the
reviews
indicate
try
this
one
fresh
and
ontap
you
wont
be
disappointed
resume
i
am
highly
impressed
with
this
beer
great
malts
great
bitter
levels
nose
is
spot
on
for
style
try
a
fresh
warm
one
today
bought
a
whole
case
of
eel
river
organic
to
share
with
wifey
we
were
not
impressed
with
any
of
the
offerings
some
would
say
that
organic
beer
doesnt
deviate
from
the
flavor
id
beg
to
differ
and
id
beg
anyone
out
there
not
to
buy
this
case
for
me
end
of
story
i
like
this
one
will
i
buy
it
again
probably
not
i
really
really
like
it
but
the
ipa
scene
is
really
overcrowded
with
great
beers
in
my
part
of
the
midwest
this
is
one
of
them
for
sure
but
its
hard
to
find
and
i
would
probably
pick
some
of
the
cheaper
options
first
the
organic
label
doesnt
really
do
much
for
the
taste
and
is
therefore
worthless
in
terms
of
the
additional
pricetag
another
good
beer
from
eel
river
a
drinkable
ipa
not
a
great
one
the
organic
properties
do
nothing
for
me
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
drinkability
is
middling
because
it
is
unbalanced
d
apparently
the
brewery
has
said
this
is
more
of
an
english
style
ipa
but
it
doesnt
state
that
anywhere
on
the
bottle
my
impression
was
that
it
just
wasnt
very
fresh
still
i
found
it
drinkable
enough
and
i
like
that
its
organic
i
might
pick
this
one
up
again
if
i
get
onto
an
organiconly
kick
but
if
im
feeling
nostalgic
again
ill
probably
go
for
some
north
coast
nose
is
pleasant
but
quite
tame
sweet
light
malts
and
husky
grains
with
hoppy
hints
coming
in
the
form
of
honeysuckle
floral
notes
and
a
bit
of
grassiness
hints
of
citrus
waft
in
and
out
a
touch
of
lemon
bitterness
shows
up
in
the
flavor
profile
hop
flavors
noticeably
on
the
light
side
quite
grainy
and
crisp
with
a
slight
medicinal
quality
creeping
in
at
the
swallow
not
a
bad
beer
but
forgettable
and
too
tame
for
an
ipa
even
an
english
one
overall
i
dont
think
ill
have
a
problem
drinking
the
5
remaining
bottles
but
im
pretty
sure
there
will
always
be
something
more
desirable
available
so
i
likely
wont
pick
this
up
again
dfirst
and
probably
last
time
i
drink
this
brew
very
mild
thin
and
not
very
enjoyable
for
an
english
ipa
style
it
is
drinkable
i
prefer
american
ipas
so
this
wont
be
on
my
repurchase
list
but
for
english
ipa
fans
it
is
worth
a
try
tastes
malty
wet
with
decent
hop
flavor
mild
hop
bitter
strong
carbonation
and
a
candysugarlike
end
that
does
dry
in
the
finish
like
the
sugary
of
a
sweettart
hop
flavor
is
woody
english
oranges
and
baby
aspirin
hop
bitter
is
quite
clean
and
hits
late
esters
are
strawberry
and
muted
apricot
the
finish
comes
across
much
drier
as
i
get
farther
through
the
bottle
strong
carbonation
and
mdlight
body
thats
a
bit
cream
with
fruit
character
overall
this
beer
is
decent
drinkability
probably
fantastic
beer
if
you
like
really
bitter
ones
but
this
ones
not
for
me
im
afraid
its
not
my
favorite
ipa
but
its
alright
it
also
hides
the
7
alcohol
pretty
well
one
final
note
dont
drink
this
one
ice
cold
the
flavors
only
reach
their
peak
as
the
beer
warms
up
a
bit
its
an
entirely
different
and
unpleasant
beer
when
poured
straight
from
the
fridge
not
really
impressed
more
of
a
session
ipa
hides
the
7
2
brilliantly
though
thats
impressive
but
not
a
west
coast
style
i
got
duped
in
the
store
knew
nothing
about
it
saw
west
coast
ipa
on
the
label
thought
itd
be
huge
apparently
its
english
oh
well
pours
a
straight
amber
with
minimal
head
slight
lacing
smell
is
sweet
caramel
and
bitter
oily
hops
taste
is
not
what
i
anticipated
simply
put
this
is
a
very
sweet
malty
beer
malts
of
maple
and
honey
there
is
a
hops
backbone
i
am
no
hardcore
hophead
but
this
does
not
fit
my
idea
of
an
ipa
and
i
dont
like
sweet
beersespecially
when
i
want
a
mouth
of
hops
thumbs
down
i
dont
know
if
its
phsycological
but
because
its
organic
i
dont
get
the
hangover
of
other
ipas
i
drank
5
of
6pack
and
was
able
to
function
the
next
day
for
the
entire
day
value
this
brewery
seems
to
get
minimal
love
on
this
website
but
i
think
this
is
another
impressive
beer
for
those
of
us
who
dont
always
want
to
spend
12
dollars
on
a
sixer
this
isnt
a
bad

from

i
had
a
fresh
one
tonight
and
it
was
much
better
very
nice
floral

one
finger
off

and
doesnt
bring
out
enough
oily
and
estery
hop
resin
to
make
this

to

several
of
these
overall
an
average
ipa
that
you
should
try
if
you
see
it
but
i
am
really
doubting
that
i
would
reccomend
this
beer
as
a
starter
to
a
session
since
its
just
allaround
mild
and
not
very
flavorfull

poured
an

with

that
left
the

thickly

there
was
hardly
an
aroma
to
speak
of
a
slight
bit
of
hops
and
fruit
was
all
there
was
to
be
found
the
taste
was
the
most
disappointing
aspect
of
the
beer
minimal
hops
but
i
doubt
ill
make
a
special
trip
the
aroma
really
killed
it
for
me
with
the
hops
almost
being
hidden
by
the
malts
some
spice
and
yeast
reveal
themselves
after
a
couple
of
drinks
the
nose
has
nothing
other
than
unexciting
yeast
it
kept
thinking
of

put

my
first
from
this
brewhouse
color
is
a
cloudy
deep
orange
lots
of
malt
sweetness
at
first
and
then
it
releases
the
hops
not
too
much
though
more
hops
come
out
as
you
progress
throught
the
brew
carbonation
is
good
and
maintains
throughout
the
drinking
process
would
like
to
have
had
more
hop
bitterness
but
i
assume
this
is
a
pretty
accurate
english
style
beer
drinkable
but
english
ipa
more
like

very
b
im
pouring
this
into

it

good
for
a
plastic

clear
golden

with
a
pure
white

that
has
a

from

excellent

and
superb
balance
of

and
grains
hops
are
earthy
and
firm
giving
a
mellower
take
on
the
american
ipa
signature
while
remaining
quite
hoppy
taste
is
something
that
seems
requires
sophistication
given
the
markedly
different
style
british
ipa
are
from
american
the
malt
is
lovely
and
multilayered
with
breads
lightly
toasted
light
caramel
sweetness
a
mild

yeast
fruitiness
covered
by
strong
hops
hops
are
earthy
fuggles
i
think
with
a
resiny
oiliness
that
lingers
cleanly
some
biscuit
on
the
palate
that
makes
me
think
maris
otter
malt
as
well
feel
is
crisp
with
an
exceptionally
drinkable
weight
carbonation
is
lively
keeping
it
delightful
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
great
beer
that
seems
to
be
lost
on
a
neanderthal
expectation
of
hops
smakdown
in
a
style
that
doesnt
warrant
it

hoppy
while
being
decidedly
reserved
in
the
british
tradition

would

to
a

someone
with

the
closest
comparison
that
i
have
would
be
alexander

pale

no
hints

certainly
not
an

this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
i
find
it
enjoyable
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
well
made
just
dont
expect
to
get
hop
smacked
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
an
american
interpretation
of
an
english
ipa
but
besides
of
the
us
citrusy
and
a
soft
tartness
it
ended
up
with
milder
flavors
than
the
original
reference
i
like
the
concept
had
a
few
burton
ipas
over
in

this
just
seems
like
a
very

not
worth
buying

an

overall
whats
the

between
this
and
their

maybe
its

a

even
keeled
but
not
remarkable
this
is
definitely
an
english
ipa
i
dont
know
if
its
the
beer
thats
lacking
or
the
continued
bombardment
of
my
taste
buds
that
is
hampering
my
judgement
the
beer
has
a
thick
malt
base
though
id
probably
say
a
bit
too
much
really
hop
influence
is
calm
for
an
english
ipa
it
works
on
this
one
it
sorta
works
notes
on
the
whole
a
nice
bitter
beer
good
with
food
i
prefer
the
aipa
style
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
take
on
an
english
ipa
stopped
by
the
publick
house
for
a
bite
and
to
pick
up
some
irs

ordered
a
flight
with
bratwurst
brew
arrivedin
a
few
ounce
sample
pour
transparent
orange
yellow
smells
of
watered

hops
tastes
like
an
english
ipa
which
tastes
to
me
like
an
old
ipa
bitterness
is
on
the
finish
only
easy
drinking
but
when
i
want
an
ipa
i
like
more
of
a
hop
assault
d
nicely
done
a
little
lacking
in
the
hop
character
but
otherwise
quite
appropriately
british
very
thin
head
but
nice
lacing
on
a
orange
golden
body
very
woody
mostly
cedar
and
also
very
nutty
with
toasted

malts
fr
aroma
flavors
of
english
malt
and
yeast
very
toasty
buscuity
and
nutty
but
lightly
hopped
with
an
abrupt
finish
with
the
flavor
being
cut
off
immediately
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
a
little
oily
the
english
character
is
excellent
needs
more
hops
even
for
the
style
it
is
under
hopped
overall
a
nice
eipa
im
a
much
bigger
fan
of
the
american
ipa
but
this
is
still
a
tasty
beer
not
something
id
rush
out
to
buy
more
of
but
still
nice
to
have
tried
very
balanced
and
easy
drinking
a
competent
english
ipa
an
enjoyable
english
ipa
the
taste
was
just
a
bit
one
dimensional
in
my
opinion
but
i
would
be
willing
to
have
another
of
these
sometime
pours
with
an
amber
color
crystal
clear
with
desent
carbonation
the
head
is
smallish
and
white
leaving
some

aroma
is
mostly
malt
based
with
hints
of
hops
and
minerals
taste
is
really
good
balance
malts
and
hops
that
have
a
bitter
and
sweet
aspect
sweet
and
sour
a
very
good
eipa
not
sure
how
this
compares
to
the
original
burton
ipa
but
the
taste
is
close
to
what
i
expected
after
reading
about
them
seek
this
one
out
if
you
want
to
see
what
the
classic
burton
ipa
was
like
however
dont
expect
it
to
be
anything
like
the
american
ipa
we
have
all
come
to
love
o
nice
and
flavorful
nothing
that
really
jumps
outs
except
that
it
is
a
fruity
ipa
rjt
d
i
feel
like
this
example
may
not
have
been
the
freshest
but
it
is
a
shame
when
there
is
no
bottle
conditioning
to
let
the
customer
know
the
acetaldehyde
in
the
nose
definitely
threw
me
off
as
i
felt
some
late
kettle
or
even
dry
hopping
additions
would
have
really
helped
this
brew
out
not
a
great
example
of
a
not
so
great
style
to
begin
with
pale
orange
in
color
with
excellent
clarity
poured
with
a
short
white
foam
that
reduced
to
a
wispy
soapy
cap
that
left
sheets
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
resinous
pine
and
ripe
citrus
orange
hop
aromas
with
sweet
caramel
malt
in
the
background
creamy
smooth
feel
with
rich
carbonation
pine
hop
flavors
are
dominant
throughout
ripe
citrus
orange
and
pungent
floral
hop
flavors
up
front
and
thru
the
middle
with
a
sweet
caramel
malt
bacbone
finishes
with
a
lingering
pine
hop
bitterness
the
body
was
smooth
even
and
well
balanced
drinkability
was
excellent
i
could
easily
drink
these
all
afternoon
overall
a
very
nice
take
on
the
style
this
is
a
must
try
if
you
see
it
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
clear
golden
with
a
white
head
and
plentiful
streaming
bubbles
the
head
dissipates
slowly
as
expected
with
this
style
the
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
sweet
and
bready
malts
with
some
earthy
and
citrus
hops
the
malt
brings
a
toasted
bread
flavor
with
back
end
earthy
bitterness
from
the
hops
there
is
some
citrus
in
the
flavor
as
well
but
this
is
mild
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
dry
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
solid
and
true
to
style
poured
into
a
black
raven
pint
glass
pours
a
light
golden
orange
amber
one
finger
fine
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
looks
good
light
aroma
of
pineapple
and
light
caramel
malt
not
much
hops
present
flavor
is
mild
bready
and
light
toasted
malt
light
citrus
hops
low
key
but
well
integrated
mild
citrus
and
hop
aftertaste
the
citrus
has
a
mild
astringent
effect
that
slightly
marrs
the
flavor
a
bit
of
pleasant
earthy
spiciness
developed
in
the
finish
as
the
beer
warmed
medium
bodied
a
mild
english
style
ale
that
may
well
be
true
to
style
unfortunately
ive
never
had
the
chance
to
try
a
try
early
20th
century
ipa
but
this
seems
like
it
would
be
in
character
an
original
ipa
as
an
18
yo
many
years
ago
and
thinking
what
a
bitter
useless
beer
boy
how
times
have
changed
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
hops
are
present
taste
is
bitter
some
piney
hops
a
bit
of
malts
not
a
lot
of
flavor
other
than
bitterness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
mediocre
beer
not
my
favorite
style
by
a
long
shot
but
southampton
did
a
good
job
replicating
an
epaeipa
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
seems
like
it
could
use
a
little
more
malts
and
a
little
less
minerals
poured
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
small
cap
of
white
head
aroma
of
bready
malts
dull
distant
hops
hmm
my
fears
of
a
maltheavy
ipa
were
confirmed
on
the
taste
toasty
grains
nutshells
mild
leafy
and
earthy
hops
fairly
and
smooth
for
the
style
but
not
very
flavorful
or
balanced
solid
overall
but
nothing
tremendous
aka
a
britishstyle
ale
o
good
example
of
the
style
o
pretty
good
but
didnt
meet
my
expectations
which
were
quite
high
o
this
is
only
ok
by
me
ive
generally
been
pretty
happy
with
southamptons
beers
but
this
one
leaves
me
a
little
flat
i
had
a
middle
ages
english
ipa
right
before
this
one
and
that
one
may
have
had
an
impact
on
how
i
viewed
this
one
as
it
was
more
american
in
style
and
i
liked
it
better
served
on
tap
at
the
crab
shack
in
newport
news
va
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
distinctly
floral
with
fruity
accents
and
the
taste
is
well
balanced
hoppy
but
not
overpowering
mouthfeel
is
solid
with
a
good
bitter
aftertaste
again
not
overpowering
overall
this
is
a
solid
ipa
great
english
ipa
well
balanced
body
malty
flavor
with
crisp
medium
bitter
finish
though
local
it
is
very
bland
decent
beer
with
a
clear
gold
color
and
great
head
first
thing
i
smell
ids
malt
taste
hits
you
first
with
malty
sweetness
than
moves
into
the
bitterness
of
hops
and
citrus
more
citrus
than
hops
finish
is
bitter
and
nice
and
ends
crisp
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
overall
ok
but
expected
a
little
more
kick
of
the
hops
o
not
a
bad
beer
the
bitterness
is
i
the
forefront
with
some
floral
hop
notes
the
malt
flavor
is
short
lived
and
is
taken
over
by
the
hop
bitterness
overall
not
bad
but
id
like
to
see
more
hop
aroma
when
i
uncapped
the
bottle
and
took
my
first
whiff
i
thought
uhoh
this
may
be
a
skunk
but
the
aroma
in
the
glass
was
much
improved
the
taste
however
confirmed
my
earlier
suspicions
not
a
taste
i
would
want
to
pay
for
again
but
ill
have
to
give
it
another
chance
and
hope
for
a
fresher
bottle
this
english
style
ipa
makes
me
feel
like
getting
my
armor
on
and
heading
out
to
find
a
dragon
to
slay
great
taste
with
the
bitterness
moderated
by
a
vague
citrusy
sweetness
the
color
is
coppery
with
a
nice
head
and
lacy
trails
definitely
btings
out
the
knight
in
me
o
pretty
good
lighttasting
beer
well
balanced
although
not
my
favorite
style
this
is
enjoyable
easy
drinking
pours
from
the
12
oz
bottle
an
impressive
copper
color
with
a
foamy
2
finger
head
there
seems
to
be
almost
no
carbonation
going
on
inside
the
glass
i
had
to
look
really
hard
to
find
a
small
handful
of
tiny
bubbles
aroma
is
surprisingly
faint
with
almost
no
hop
presence
i
get
mostly
the
aroma
of
toasted
malt
1st
sip
brings
a
sharp
note
of
spicy
piney
hops
but
its
not
the
overwhelming
inyourface
hoppiness
that
comes
with
most
american
ipas
mouthfeel
is
right
down
the
middle
neither
watery
of
heavy
overall
this
is
a
decent
very
drinkable
ipa
a
refreshing
change
from
all
the
overdone
hop
bombs
out
there
12
ounce

in
a

glass
the
beer
pours
a
copperorange

with
a
couple
inch
offwhite

that
sticked
around
for
a
while
theres
also
a
good
amount
of

aroma
is
herbal
and
citrusy
orange
lemon
peel
hops
and
some

the
brew
tastes

herbal
and
citrusy
grapefruit
oranges
hops
and
some
bready
and
caramel
malt
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
but
also
has
a
little
too
much
carbonation
for
me
i
still
think
its
a
decent
enough
brew
overall
its
certainly
worth
trying
id
like
to
have
this
one
again
in
the
future
o
im
not
one
to
try
too
many
english
ipas
but
this
one
is
a
quality
offering
for
the
style
and
has
me
thinking
i
should
try
a
few
more
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
of
100
uk
fuggles
which
didnt
steal
the
show
but
had
enough
of
a
presence
to
work
well
with
the
light
bitterness
and
overall
toasty
malty
flavor
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
brew
again
when
im
in
the
mood
for
another
english
ipa
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
2
finger
pillowy
head
smells
is
great
with
lots
of
fruity
hops
and
grains
taste
is
spot
on
not
overpowering
but
delicious
plenty
of
oranges
hops
and
pines
not
too
bitter
very
sessionable
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
great
wish
it
was
available
to
me
o
although
the
label
says
english
ipa
it
lacks
the
balance
and
subdued
notes
i
have
come
to
expect
from
the
english
variety
this
is
an
american
ipa
in
character
and
not
a
great
one
at
that
overall
a
smooth
solid
ipa
cheers
o
goes
down
a
bit
meh
not
very
tasty
not
too
filling
mild
kick
not
a
good
representation
of
style
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
beer
and
would
not
seek
it
out
again
so
yeah
go
get
one
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
quite
bitter
in
the
finish
the
midpalate
is
entirely
populated
by
the
hop
flavors
more
piny
and
more
earth
with
a
mild
citrus
flavor
in
the
middle
very
nice
id
have
this
again
very
excited
about
a
decent
ipa
from
va
im
not
an
ipa
person
nor
a
hops
person
but
i
can
definitely
get
down
with
this
i
only
wish
i
cracked
this
growler
before
a
meal
since
i
think
its
probably
rife
with
potential
for
food
pairings
poured
to
a
beautiful
head
at
least
a
couple
fingers
with
a
wonderful
smell
very
fresh
and
brightly
hopped
medium
sized
bubbles
looked
to
be
a
nice
copper
color
to
a
colorblind
like
me
dominating
bitter
hops
but
with
an
exciting
sweetness
that
was
the
perfect
complement
to
the
fresh
blast
of
hops
very
light
and
refreshing
body
in
the
mouth
does
the
job
great
good
session
beer
there
was
no
freshness
date
on
the
box
or
the
bottle
so
there
is
no
way
to
know
really
if
i
got
a
bad
one
overall
drinkability
pretty
good
beer
not
an
amazing
english
ipa
but
pretty
good
the
molasses
flavor
had
me
surprised
that
it
was
there
at
all
and
it
kept
the
beer
interesting
the
whole
way
down
i
could
have
another
but
i
think
i
would
want
it
paired
with
food
when
i
have
it
again
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
an
amber
color
medium
off
white
head
grassy
feety
aroma
of
thistle
more
grainy
than
hoppy
a
good
beer
but
suspect
ipa
credentials
sufficiently
bitter
but
not
really
derived
from
the
hops
ash
and
lemon
grass
fiinish
could
use
more
citrus
flavors
but
overall
a
sessionable
ipa
hv
overall
this
would
be
a
beer
you
would
give
to
someone
who
hates
ipas
in
an
effort
to
introduce
them
to
the
style
some
hop
flavor
exists
but
it
is
just
so
overpowered
by
the
sugary
taste
that
its
tough
to
finish
a
very
complex
and
unique
ipa
one
that
was
very
satisfying
to
drink
id
have
two
or
three
in
a
sitting
note
be
careful
when
you
pour
this
beer
it
damn
near
overflowed
from
the
glass
if
not
for
my
quick
lips
the
head
would
have
been
all
over
the
desktop
this
one
comes
off
more
as
a
full
flavored
amber
than
any
kind
of
ipa
this
brewery
makes
good
beers
but
they
seem
to
be
off
on
style
guidelines
watching
kevin
millwood
fail
this
consistently
makes
me
wonder
why
hes
still
considered
an
ace
anyway
this
beer
pours
a
clear
ambercopper
topped
by
a
thick
healthy
offwhite
froth
the
nose
comprises
sweet
sweet
toffee
with
what
seems
like
a
cinnamon
vein
orange
peel
and
hoppy
florals
the
taste
brings
those
hops
forward
adding
in
a
decent
amount
of
piney
grapefruit
to
the
already
plentiful
greenery
though
the
toffee
stays
strong
even
having
the
last
word
in
the
form
of
an
interesting
stab
of
sweetness
at
the
end
the
body
is
a
slight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
surprisingly
good
relatively
malty
ipa
this
beer
is
a
great
example
of
a
tasty
i
p
a
that
can
be
a
session
beer
thanks
to
the
abv
of
5
and
the
clean
drinkability
a
lot
of
earthy
spice
notes
dancing
with
the
sweet
malt
leaves
a
spicy
hop
resin
on
the
lips
with
a
sweet
apricot
finnish
gets
very
creamy
as
it
warms
up
a
little
good
stuff
d
pretty
good
although
i
tired
of
the
sour
aftertaste
after
awhile
d
outstanding
this
beer
is
unexpectedly
delicious
for
one
so
seemingly
average
very
drinkable
i
will
buy
many
more
the
next
time
i
see
any
mouthfeel
is
slightly
filmy
thick
and
heavy
but
pleasant
balance
of
bitter
and
sweet
makes
for
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
this
isnt
a
strong
beer
but
i
wouldnt
consider
downing
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
this
seems
to
come
a
simpler
time
when
things
were
a
bit
slower
in
the
word
and
likewise
this
is
not
a
chugging
beer
ill
admit
i
like
more
pizazz
in
my
pale
ales
but
this
was
a
welcome
change
of
pace
and
didnt
have
so
much
of
the
burn
associated
with
its
american
counterparts
having
a
beer
like
this
is
good
for
expanding
horizons
if
nothing
else
drinkability
an
okay
or
less
than
okay
ipa
this
does
not
really
fit
the
style
because
the
malt
is
so
pronounced
the
hop
profile
needs
adjustments
worth
a
try
d
a
good
not
great
english
ipa
that
is
a
little
better
in
the
bottle
but
not
bad
ontap
da
classic
uk
ipa
in
the
usa
one
of
the
most
balanced
and
flavouful
english
ipas
i
have
ever
had
an
absolute
treat
to
have
on
cask
pours
an
orange
tinted
brown
with
a
silky
beige
head
and
nice
lacing
nose
has
mellow
hops
and
sweet
bready
malts
taste
is
also
on
the
malty
side
but
well
balanced
with
subtle
floral
hops
medium
body
is
well
carbonated
but
a
bit
watery
drinks
nicely
good
example
of
the
english
style
drinkability
the
5
abv
and
the
taste
say
it
all
this
is
a
kick
ass
brew
sixer
from
the
brewery
this
afternoon
im
a
bigger
fan
of
american
style
ipas
but
this
was
drinkable
enough
not
really
memorable
for
me
though
strong
on
the
nose
like
aged
rolled
tobacco
and
sugar
rolling
onto
the
tongue
with
stronger
malts
than
the
traditional
hoppiness
of
an
ipa
really
very
nice
on
the
tongue
light
as
can
be
but
with
a
maltiness
that
can
most
closely
be
likened
to
a
long
cigar
making
you
roll
your
tongue
just
a
bit
with
each
exhale
much
less
hoppy
than
you
might
expect
from
an
ipa
maybe
best
labeled
and
positioned
as
a
pa
or
otherwise
so
as
not
to
completely
confuse
the
consumer
enjoyable
though
on
its
merits
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
with
a
nice
character
a
pretty
tasty
beer
good
job
d
ill
call
it
a
solid
ipa
a
good
example
of
the
malty
side
of
the
style
but
without
any
relative
bitterness
it
seems
more
like
a
heavy
bodied
apa
even
being
in
the
english
style
d
this
is
a
pretty
decent
english
ipa
it
has
a
decent
malt
and
hop
balance
to
it
but
the
taste
wasnt
what
i
was
looking
for
i
guess
taste
is
pretty
good
lots
of
citrus
and
piny
hops
with
some
malt
to
balance
it
out
slight
caramel
malt
taste
feel
is
pretty
good
medium
body
and
mediumhigh
carbonation
leaves
a
bit
of
stickiness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
drinkability
is
decent
its
not
the
most
balanced
ipa
but
its
still
pretty
good
if
it
werent
for
the
stickiness
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
im
a
fan
of
overhopped
ipas
in
general
but
i
of
course
did
not
expect
that
with
this
style
a
good
beer
in
the
category
d
very
drinkable
ipa
thats
wellbalanced
and
not
overly
hoppy
hops
are
subdued
but
this
is
still
a
flavorful
brew
somewhat
of
a
dry
backbite
this
is
just
a
simple
yet
very
enjoyable
ipa
m
d
a
lighter
smoother
carbonation
which
makes
for
a
nicer
feel
a
medium
body
with
a
touch
of
weightiness
to
it
along
with
a
fairly
typical
alcohol
content
it
makes
for
a
reasonably
easy
drinking
beer
a
decent
effort
with
only
the
one
little
offtaste
kind
of
putting
me
off
overall
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
and
a
great
session
brew
one
does
not
have
to
be
a
hophead
to
enjoy
this
one
highly
recommended
to
anyone
who
can
get
their
hands
on
it
im
currently
working
on
my
5th
keg
at
home
and
just
as
it
makes
a
great
pint
for
a
session
it
is
a
really
good
accompaniment
to
food
steak
chicken
curry
you
name
it
this
beer
tastes
wonderful
overall
a
good
session
ipa
this
poured
a
nice
clear
copper
with
a
little
white
head
it
smelled
like
a
good
standard
ipa
with
pine
hopes
and
some
malt
it
tasted
strongly
of
the
pine
hops
with
a
bit
of
dry
nut
flavor
and
some
slight
malt
for
balance
it
had
a
good
smooth
and
moderately
thick
texture
with
almost
no
carbonation
and
a
notable
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
albeit
typical
ipa
drinkability
refreshing
and
wellcrafted
a
nice
effort
d
this
is
a
pretty
easy
ipa
to
drink
it
is
well
balanced
and
goes
down
smoothly
not
a
huge
hoplovers
ipa
the
hops
are
nonetheless
present
in
enough
force
to
make
this
clearly
an
english
style
ipa
though
with
more
of
a
pine
taste
than
most
true
ipas
from
england
that
ive
had
overall
i
like
this
one
very
solid
representation
of
the
style
favorite
part
of
it
would
be
the
overall
spicy
flavor
to
it
yum
d
this
was
an
average
beer
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
would
not
seek
it
out
again
an
orange
tea
colored
brew
with
a
goodly
foamy
head
and
decent
bits
of
lacing
throughout
a
fairly
unique
aroma
of
barbeque
malt
and
piney
hops
very
palatable
blend
the
taste
is
a
nice
mellow
mouthful
of
creamy
malt
and
earthy
hops
again
nicely
and
uniquely
blended
with
a
tasteful
hint
of
alcohol
at
only
5
5
some
deep
toffee
tones
are
there
as
well
almost
butterscotch
sweet
very
drinkable
meekly
carbonated
but
very
nice
body
a
dry
bitter
finish
follows
i
like
this
one
and
will
recommend
to
all
drinkability
one
of
the
less
enjoyable
ipas
for
me
although
i
will
finish
the
bottle
im
looking
forward
to
the
next
beer
to
wash
this
one
away
d
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
and
could
easily
make
it
my
drink
for
the
night
it
was
enjoyable
and
i
will
seek
this
one
out
on
draught
after
drinking
a
bottle
of
this
brewerys
excellent
porter
which
is
called
porter
i
had
high
hopes
for
the
rest
of
their
lineup
ipa
is
something
of
letdown
because
it
doesnt
do
the
very
thing
that
ipas
are
built
to
do
namely
to
provide
a
boatload
of
hop
flavor
lets
hope
that
st
george
had
something
more
fortifying
in
him
before
he
waded
in
to
slay
the
beast
served
on
cask
at
capital
ale
house
in
richmond
served
a
nice
light
copper
with
a
nice
frothy
head
that
was
slow
to
diminish
and
left
great
lacing
the
aroma
was
some
mild
earthy
hops
and
sweet
malts
the
taste
was
an
undertoned
balance
of
mild
earthy
hops
and
some
pale
malts
but
overall
was
a
little
on
the
bland
side
the
beer
was
light
bodied
with
very
low
carbonation
this
one
did
make
for
a
moderately
enjoyable
cask
brew
but
ive
had
better
very
nice
beer
one
of
the
best
ipas
ive
had
in
a
while
pours
clean
with
a
nice
head
nice
dark
goldenamber
color
allowed
the
light
to
shine
through
a
bit
enhancing
its
look
very
nice
aroma
wiht
a
subtle
hoppy
scent
wonderful
clean
tasted
very
crisp
a
touch
towards
the
bitter
side
but
just
enough
to
make
it
a
wonderful
ipa
goes
down
smooth
as
well
i
highly
recommend
this
one
the
taste
is
a
bit
too
medicinal
for
me
but
it
has
a
big
hop
flavor
some
white
grape
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
citrus
a
thin
refreshing
body
with
a
nice
piney
hop
aftertaste
finishes
the
flavor
i
cant
say
this
is
an
beer
ill
have
again
but
its
worth
a
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
english
style
ipas
its
a
nice
tasting
beer
that
is
a
good
change
of
pace
ipa
as
the
beer
warms
it
becomes
a
bit
less
drinkable
imo
i
also
find
this
more
filling
as
the
usual
ipa
the
mouth
is
thick
with
high
but
fine
carbonation
alright
here
a
pretty
nice
ipa
but
not
anything
to
seek
out
unfortunately
i
really
want
a
good
english
ipa
d
this
beer
simply
doesnt
taste
good
i
dont
enjoy
drinking
it
but
i
am
able
to
finish
it
i
will
not
have
this
one
again
dnot
my
preference
when
it
comes
to
ipas
but
this
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
if
i
was
looking
to
have
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
ansd
not
get
hammered
drinkabilitynotes
i
1st
had
this
beer
at
the
old
dominion
beerfest
a
couple
of
years
ago
i
thought
it
was
a
standout
then
now
i
wonder
why
it
took
me
so
long
to
give
this
a
go
again
what
a
drinkable
ipa
again
its
not
your
typical
american
ipa
a
truly
english
style
ipa
brewed
with
all
fuggles
which
i
like
a
lot
really
nice
and
bitter
with
a
pepper
like
spiciness
that
is
balanced
by
a
malt
bill
that
gives
it
a
subtle
light
caramel
like
sweetness
the
yeast
kicks
out
some
fruity
like
esters
as
well
at
5
abv
this
could
almost
be
considered
a
true
session
beer
in
the
english
sense
of
things
definitely
seek
this
one
out
if
you
are
looking
for
something
different
from
your
american
ipas
you
wont
be
dissappointed
however
if
you
think
you
bought
an
american
ipa
and
are
not
used
to
the
english
style
of
ipa
then
i
could
see
why
this
beer
doesnt
get
rated
as
high
as
i
think
it
should
highly
recommended
and
extremely
drinkable
seek
and
enjoy
i
was
never
that
impressed
with
the
bottled
version
dont
get
me
wrong
it
was
solid
just
not
impressive
this
cask
version
was
how
do
i
say
unfingbelievable
i
will
be
seeking
out
other
cask
brews
thank
you
ba
d
drinkable
ipa
solid
with
a
good
body
and
nice
flavors
good
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
i
like
this
brewcould
be
a
decent
session
brew
pours
a
dark
orange
color
with
a
thinnish
head
not
as
clear
as
most
ipas
smell
was
a
mix
of
caramel
maltiness
and
floral
hops
very
earthy
had
a
bitter
taste
and
a
strong
malt
backbone
with
light
caramel
flavors
lots
of
body
to
it
and
tasty
could
be
a
bit
tough
to
drink
for
some
but
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
d
the
ale
struggles
to
present
itself
as
an
ipa
english
or
otherwise
as
the
hops
dont
want
to
do
anything
picked
up
this
bottle
on
my
trip
through
virgina
pour
reveals
a
clear
brassy
orange
liquid
with
a
half
inch
of
dense
white
head
earthy
floral
hops
with
some
toffee
bready
malts
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruits
figs
maybe
make
up
the
aroma
the
taste
is
fairly
bitter
with
some
earthiness
to
it
fruits
come
out
more
in
the
taste
with
the
malts
and
floral
hops
almost
seems
like
they
mixed
an
english
ipa
with
an
english
barleywine
not
bad
by
any
means
but
different
creamy
slick
medium
body
with
a
dry
finish
i
must
admit
that
it
seems
to
be
growing
on
me
more
as
it
warms
up
a
little
pours
a
golden
orange
color
thick
head
of
large
white
bubbles
aroma
is
very
light
citrus
lemon
and
grain
taste
follows
the
aroma
along
with
a
very
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
flavors
and
aroma
are
very
washed
out
the
aftertaste
is
the
only
thing
remotely
resembling
an
ipa
bitter
grapefruit
which
seems
strange
for
an
english
ipa
anyway
not
terrible
just
a
bit
odd
and
on
teh
borring
side
a
great
ale
to
start
off
the
night
with
try
with
a
pizza
that
has
a
garlicky
cream
base
for
a
sauce
might
go
well
with
some
sharp
cheddar
and
crackers
i
wasnt
aware
that
this
beer
was
an
english
style
ipa
when
i
bought
it
so
it
was
different
than
what
i
expected
still
its
a
good
beer
although
the
style
is
not
my
favorite
recommended
for
fans
of
the
style
and
others
as
well
just
be
sure
you
know
what
youre
getting
well
balanced
and
in
the
british
style
lacks
complexity
but
is
a
solid
straight
forward
example
of
a
uk
ipa
good
session
ale
and
very
dry
and
refreshing
in
the
heat
drinkability
wow
talk
about
impressive
and
out
of
the
blue
for
me
ive
had
a
lot
of
st
george
and
ive
liked
all
ive
had
and
this
continues
to
follow
that
trend
looks
like
ill
have
to
seek
out
all
i
can
now
great
great
stuff
md
this
ipa
was
very
thick
and
full
bodied
medium
carbonation
very
enjoyable
5
00
abv
makes
this
a
very
good
session
beer
i
like
the
fact
that
this
is
a
lower
alcohol
beer
5
0
this
style
appears
to
lend
itself
to
session
status
i
would
prefer
to
drink
several
st
george
ipa
on
a
warm
day
than
a
6
8
beer
with
a
very
similar
taste
like
the
sn
product
id
like
to
try
this
on
tap
somewhere
here
in
the
area
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
beige
head
above
the
copper
brew
head
fades
but
tries
to
hang
on
with
average
at
best
lacing
aroma
is
lightly
fruity
with
some
wet
grains
taste
is
dominated
by
generic
bitterness
which
carries
into
the
aftertaste
as
well
leaving
little
room
for
much
else
to
be
observed
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
suffer
from
same
not
something
i
would
revisit
12
oz
with
no
freshness
date
pours
a
clear
amber
with
2
fingers
of
offwhite
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
smells
of
hop
oils
with
a
strange
mustiness
tastes
like
nasty
veggies
with
some
hops
malts
perhaps
a
touch
of
rotting
fruit
and
it
has
a
medium
body
the
flavors
are
not
good
at
all
i
hope
this
is
a
bad
bottlebatch
because
their
porter
was
pretty
good
not
an
in
your
face
ipabut
worth
seeking
out
i
love
trying
new
things
i
believe
i
have
seen
this
one
around
in
the
south
but
i
had
definately
never
had
it
thanks
px2grafx
thanks
to
px2grafx
for
the
sample
overall
like
said
earlier
a
nice
change
of
pace
to
your
average
english
ipa
the
fuggles
presents
a
nice
array
of
earthy
flavors
and
the
malts
balance
out
good
bitterness
as
well
another
st
george
offering
misrepresented
by
low
ratings
edit
after
letting
it
warm
up
just
a
bit
it
was
better
spices
came
out
and
hop
profile
was
enhanced
not
that
bad
after
all
still
a
bit
unbalanced
the
taste
is
mildly
hoppy
at
first
but
the
aftertaste
brings
out
some
additional
hops
it
is
a
little
watered
down
not
the
best
ipa
ever
but
not
bad
drinkability
is
a
little
wacky
with
the
unbalanced
bitter
towards
the
end
reminds
me
of
a
real
british
style
ipa
taste
was
big
malt
up
front
caramel
bread
and
finished
with
a
zesty
hop
flavor
spicy
yet
citrusy
i
am
super
partial
to
fuggles
hops
lots
of
flavor
all
around
lots
of
flavor
melding
together
in
a
blurred
harmony
enjoyed
ontap
at
green
leafe
cafe
in
williamsburg
presentation
was
as
a
moderate
copper
color
with
minimal
white
head
a
pleasant
hop
aroma
dominated
with
a
background
of
malt
taste
was
also
dominated
by
a
dry
hoppiness
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
thoroughly
enjoyable
light
medium
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
crisp
mouthfeel
not
bad
just
very
tame
hazy
yellow
with
minimal
head
nose
is
a
rather
tame
floral
hoppiness
plenty
of
carbonation
which
adds
to
the
mouthfeel
ok
hop
bite
especially
in
the
finish
will
not
satisfy
hopheads
but
this
is
a
fine
hoppy
beer
like
a
good
apa
this
is
a
good
session
ipa
had
this
on
cask
at
the
green
leafe
in
williamsburg
poured
a
nice
coppery
colour
with
a
2
finger
fluffy
white
head
that
lingered
around
for
a
good
bit
aroma
was
had
a
touch
of
bready
sweetness
and
nice
floral
and
citrus
notes
taste
was
on
the
slightly
malty
side
with
a
sweet
start
and
middle
the
hops
slowly
came
in
and
dried
the
beer
out
with
some
nice
floral
notes
very
much
a
english
style
ipa
very
smooth
off
the
cask
and
it
went
really
well
with
the
rare
burger
with
blue
cheese
drinkability
is
quite
high
as
i
could
easily
had
had
a
few
or
more
over
the
course
of
an
evening
pours
a
clear
copper
under
a
chunky
1
5
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
slowly
leving
very
nice
lace
the
nose
is
mild
flowery
hops
the
mouth
is
light
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
we
start
with
a
nice
flowery
hops
opening
with
a
sweet
bitter
rather
than
bittersweet
profile
the
carnations
yield
to
some
pine
in
the
finish
but
this
is
not
a
super
bitter
ipa
the
malt
presence
is
noticeable
throughout
lending
good
balance
until
the
aftertaste
where
dry
and
bitter
rule
the
day
a
very
nice
product
its
a
good
solid
beer
but
just
a
little
bit
off
balance
hazy
amber
appearance
with
some
carbonation
nice
lacing
around
glass
smell
is
a
bit
fruity
but
the
taste
is
quite
hoppy
with
some
bitter
aftertaste
good
sensation
in
the
mouth
difficult
to
drink
more
than
one
label
says
award
winning
but
nothing
special
about
this
british
style
ale
oelergud
12
ounce

quite
cloudy

to

on
the

nice
brit

ipa
quality

taste
initially
quite
sweet
almost
too
sweet
thin
in
the
mouth
harsh
hop
bitterness
comes
through
in
a
wave
after
the
swallow
quite
bitter
in
the
finish
with
a
bold
spiciness
decent
but
there
are
many
better
options
i
prefer
an
ipa
with
hop
aroma
and
flavor
to
go
along
with
the
bitterness
pours
a
deep
goldencopper
hue
with
a
creamy
head
nice
lacing
aroma
more
of
malt
than
hops
which
belies
the
flavor
profile
very
nice
hoppy
palate
you
can
taste
the
fuggles
muted
aftertaste
but
still
wellbalanced
not
exactly
my
favorite
ipa
too
balanced
not
enough
hops
but
i
can
see
why
it
wins
awards
on
cask
at
the
newly
opened
capital
ale
house
at
innsbrook
this
was
a
surprisingly
good
britishstyled
ipa
man
i
love
casked
british
ales
so
complex
but
so
easy
to
drink
and
they
feel
like
heaven
the
beer
arrived
in
a
20oz
imperial
pint
glass
with
about
3
fingers
of
thick
thick
white
lace
that
stood
its
ground
the
entire

thick
lacing
of
the
glass
color
is
a
cloudy
dull
orange
aromas
are
not
as
hoppy
as
expected
there
is
some
floral
to
this
but
it
is
mixed
in
with
a
breadysaltine
cracker
note
as
well
flavor
is
more
along
the
lines
of
an
ipa
good
bitterness
supported
by
a
firm
malt
base
that
lends
sweetness
middle
shows
a
little
more
sweetness
and
tails
off
with
a
fruity
bitterness
that
dries
out
the
palate
a
tad
on
the
harsh
side
i
was
surprised
at
the
level
of
harshness
given
the
caskconditioning
not
bad
but
theres
better
i
prefer
the

the

it

well

even

palate
with
a
very
fine
median
carbonation
that
leaves
just
a
tingle
on
the
tongue
at
the
outset
the
flavor
is
rich
with
an
exceptionally
wellbalanced
combination
of
honeylaced
slightly
caramelish
and
biscuity
malt
thats
streaked
with
leafy
lightly
mineralish
and
softly
grassy
hop
flavors
that
become
most
apparent
in
the
drying
finish
backed
by
a
solid
bitterness
wellbalanced
and
highly
drinkable
a
brilliant
recreation
of
an
englishstyle
ipa
enjoy
this
one
at
cellar
temperature
for
its
fullest
character
the
bitterness
got
me
in
the
aftertaste
more
then
anything
not
bad
by
any
means
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
this
beer
is
brewed
in
hampton
va
and
has
a
rather
highfalutin
bottle
label
featuring
a
shield
and
fancy
scripted
lettering
i
wont
hold
that
against
the
beer
however
the
beer
weighs
in
at
5
alcohol
which
i
thought
was
a
tad
low
for
an
ipa
but
i
also
wont
let
that
bias
me
either
the
beer
pours
nicely
with
a
fairly
quickly
dissipating
head
but
has
a
beautiful
orangegolden
color
with
a
touch
of
red
or
amber
the
aroma
was
mostly
malt
a
sort
of
soft
slightly
bready
note
that
makes
you
look
forward
to
tasting
the
beer
and
when
you
taste
it
indeed
maltiness
pours
out
of
the
glass
the
flavor
is
definitely
more
balanced
toward
malt
than
hops
which
isnt
quite
what
i
expect
from
an
ipa
although
im
not
a
stickler
for
beer
styles
maybe
like
a
slightly
overbitter
bock
beer
i
should
mention
i
reviewed
this
beer
as
part
of
a
session
that
included
anchor
liberty
ale
and
new
river
pale
ale
kromagnonaug
01
but
a
nice
summer
beer
theres
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
and
very
smooth
this
isnt
the
hoppiest
ipa
that
ive
had
but
its
still
a
nice
and
enjoyable
beer

though
the
malty
sweetness
develops
as
the
beer
warms
i
agree
with
my
fellow
ba
murph
that
there
is
a
certain
coating
that
develops
on
the
teeth
would
purchase
again
but
the
batch
1000
is
still
my
favorite
from
here
this
is
another
nice
go
to
though
feel
one
of
my
favorite
parts
of
this
beer
very
comfortable
coates
the
mouth
without
feeling
suffocating
at
all
overall
i
like
this
ipa
a
lot
good
flavors
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
try
tis
if
you
visit
granite
city
overall
really
nice
ipa
when
i
went
to
dinner
i
was
looking
for
an
amber
but
chose
this
instead
it
went
well
with
a
blue
cheese
burger
and
i
am
glad
i
chose
this
i
had
no
idea
granite
city
even
bottled
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
ambercopper
topped
by
a
finger
of
offcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
perfumey
flowers
light
toffee
light
menthol
and
a
hint
of
pine
resin
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
emphasizing
the
menthol
and
adding
in
some
eucalyptus
making
it
seem
as
though
im
drinking
some
sort
of
vicks
vaporub
beer
or
something
note
to
sam
do
not
do
this
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
pretty
weak
ipa
english
or
otherwise
one
that
just
plain
doesnt
taste
all
that
good
overall
ive
had
pale
ales
that
had
more
powerful
hop
action
then
this
brew
that
being
said
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
easy
drinker
which
is
certainly
better
then
getting
any
of
the
major
products
worth
the
7
50
to
fill
up
my
growler
final
thoughts
i
had
this
beer
almost
a
year
ago
and
thought
it
was
good
having
had
lots
of
experience
in
ipas
and
beer
in
general
since
then
my
experience
this
time
was
not
so
great
i
did
a
doubletake
when
i
noticed
its
low
5
2
abv
on
the
menu
this
is
definitely
an
ipa
meant
for
the
firsttime
drinker
the
ibus
and
hop
character
are
too
low
for
my
taste
it
also
tastes
more
like
an
american
ipa
than
an
english
ipa
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
and
a
below
average
ipa
dark
amber
with
an
off
white
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
smells
and
tastes
like
caramel
with
floral
and
citrus
hops
more
bitter
than
sweet
medium
bodied
average
carbonation
has
a
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
a
decent
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
liked
it
and
would
buy
it
again
but
it
wouldnt
make
the
top
of
my
list
an
easy
drinker
with
nice
sweet
and
bitter
components
but
not
a
lot
else
going
on
o
makes
me
wish
i
was
sitting
in
a
bunker
in
bastogne
with
my
army
buddies
on
a
crisp
winter
night
if
this
is
what
the
uk
troops
drank
back
during
the
war
im
happy
to
know
it
wasnt
shite
although
i
have
the
feeling
it
was
anything
they
could
get
flavors
are
similar

the
brown

comparison
really
comes
out
in
the
taste
this
doesnt
even
taste
like
a
weak
english
ipa
this
is
just
like
a
mild
brown
ale
it
is
what
it
is
expensive
and
disappointing
i
used
to
enjoy
these
in
the
90s
they
were
helpful
in
getting
my
palate
in
shape
after
drinking
subbmc
type
of
stuff
in
the
early
half
of
the
decade
meister
brau
but
the
more
i
drink
of
these
lately
the
more
bland
and
expensive
they
come
off
d
not
hard
to
get
down
but
i
dont
want
too
have
anymore
d
worth
a
try
for
a
different
take
on
an
ipa
but
i
wont
be
looking
for
this
one
a
again
d
drinks
more
like
a
scottish
ale
very
sweet
malting
with
earthy
hopping
a
decent
drink
by
itself
but
many
will
be
disappointed
in
the
hop
bitterness
poured
dark
caramel
color
unusual
for
an

had
a

tint
in

no
head
to
note
nose
was
almost
more
malts
than
hops
tasted
of
some
hops
little
bitterness
but
not
as
hoppy
as
i
would
like
perhaps
i
am
waaay
to
accustom
to
west
coast
ipas
now
i
would
say
for
an
english
ipa
it
would
do
the
trick
sampled
in
2004
when
i
first
tried
this
beer
i
really
liked
it
i
must
have
been
drunk
im
glad
ive
had
it
again
to
give
it
the
correct
review
ipa
not
even
close
ipas
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
has
got
to
be
the
worst
one
ive
had
this
had
a
dark
brown
body
a
little
heavy
with
a
fairy
thick
head
and
a
decent
amount
of
lace
the
color
looks
nothing
like
an
ipa
hops
hardly
any
are
they
sure
they
put
the
right
label
on
this
wow
somewhat
smooth
but
not
a
fan
of
the
flavor
at
all
a
scotchy
malt
flavor
is
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
or
a
mild
version
of
their
scotch
ale
which
i
found
disgusting
maybe
ill
get
it
again
in
a
year
or
so
to
see
what
i
think
then
my
wife
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
when
i
tried
it
i
could
swear
she
had
a
jack
daniels
jack
and
cola
the
color
is
a
dark
caramel
color
with
a
nice
head
with
the
first
sip
i
gag
a
little
after
each
drink
it
become
easier
to
go
down
but
over
all
it
was
a
challenge
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
being
a
huge
fans
of
hops
and
ipa
i
was
let
down
i
am
still
confuse
why
this
is
called
an
ipa
try
it
for
a
different
take
on
an
english
ipa
but
not
if
you
really
want
a
normal
ipa
beer
certainly
not
in
the
vain
of
other
ipas
you
may
be
used
to
the
order
of
the
day
here
is
more
herbal
and
tealike
with
a
burnt
sweetness
colliding
with
the
bitter
herbal
hop
finish
think
of
it
as
an
english
pale
with
a
scottish
flare
and
youre
almost
there
mouthfeel
is
mediumthin
and
well
carbonated
this
beer
is
perfectly
sessionable
and
fine
to
drink
as
long
as
youre
not
expecting
an
ipa
d
it
isnt
great
but
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
without
a
problem
give
it
a
shot
but
remember
it
isnt
a
ipa
i
was
recommended
this
beer
by
a
small
foreign
man
who
offered
his
assistance
on
finding
a
good
beer
i
asked
for
a
strong
ipa
and
he
pointed
me
to
this
sadly
not
bad
but
nothing
like
what
i
expected
i
thought
my
beer
had
been
mislabeled
until
i
read
others
comments
tasted
and
looked
more
like
an
octoberfest
than
ipa
brown
in
color
with
little
head
lower
alcohol
content
and
no
hoppy
bitterness
this
is
nothing
like
an
ipa
still
it
was
pretty
drinkable
cheers
d
a
little
tasty
but
definitely
not
what
i
had
expected
goes
down
ok
doesnt
really
seem
to
fit
the
style
so
ill
have
to
take
the
labels
word
for
it
that
the
beer
is
an
eipa
overall
i
dont
think
its
bad
but
its
yet
another
english
beer
that
has
underwhelmed
me
much
too
imbalanced
sweetness
not
an
ipa
more
of
a
brown
alepale
ale
mix
with
a
touch
of
scottish
ale
that
doesnt
quite
come
together
well
my
advise
dont
bother
with
this
esp
if
you
are
looking

an

fair
id
have
another
but
the
mouthfeel
is

and
the
appearance
is
boardering
on
horrific
not
one
of
the
better
eipas
ive
had
in
any
event
a
fairly
enjoyable
brew
but
not
one
that
id
peg
as
very
characteristic
of
the
ipa
style
and
there
are
better
options
for
bitters
out
there
too
drinkability
on
its
own
easy
to
drink
but
not
exceptional
and
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
paired
with
some
irish
porter
cheese
it
worked
pretty
well
though
keeping
it
gaelic
here
pours
a
dark
brownish
bronze
with
a
decent
sized
head
but
the
most
appealing
part
of
the
appearance
is
some
nice
lacing
smells
of
malts
with
a
touch
of
sour
fruits
the
taste
is
rather
unremarkable
and
certainly
not
like
an
ipa
quite
weak
the
taste
is
mainly
of
malts
and
little
else
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
stronger
than
the
taste
but
still
watery
quite
drinkable
because
of
such
an
easy
finish
if
this
was
not
an
ipa
i
would
feel
differently
but
this
comes
up
a
bit
disappointing
i
will
rate
it
lower
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
for
the
disparity
between
its
stated
style
and
what
it
actually
ends
up
tasting
like
its
hard
to
know
what
the
brewer
was
even
going
for
since
i
really
couldnt
taste
any
hops
which
are
to
my
inexperienced
palate
the
main
ingredient
in
a
normal
ipa
worth
trying
just
for
the
odd
experience
but
i
cant
recommend
it
beyond
that
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
decent
head
the
smell
is
malty
with
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
is
malty
and
bitter
with
a
touch
of
sourness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
slightly
carbonated
this
is
a
pretty
nonoffensive
type
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
d
this
is
pretty
drinkable
this
is
quite
possibly
the
most
off
style
beer
i
have
ever
had
this
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
an
esb
not
a
great
esb
but
if
someone
handed
this
beer
to
me
and
asked
what
it
was
in
one
whiff
and
one
sip
i
would
say
esb
i
suppose
it
could
pass
as
a
scottish
ale
too
but
ipa
would
be
my
last
guess
there
is
very
little
hop
profile
it
is
hardly
pale
and
too
sweet
pours
just
like
sweet
tea
literally
it
has
no
head
has
the
color
and
body
of
pouring
a
glass
of
sweet
tea
my
wife
even
made
the
comment
that
it
was
wierd
that
i
was
drinking
our
sweet
tea
without
ice
aroma
is
light
caramel
and
british
malts
no
hop
aroma
at
all
which
is
surprising
for
even
an
english
ipa
flavor
is
lots
of
british
malts
and
some
caramel
in
the
background
very
little
hop
bitterness
im
not
sure
i
would
classify
this
as
an
ipa
more
like
a
bitter
body
is
medlight
light
carbonation
and
a
little
watery
a
lighter
bodied
ipa
with
above
average
carbonation
to
make
up
for
it
but
still
drinkable
and
passable
for
the
style
there
is
bitterness
there
and
some
malt
but
also
on
the
watery
side
bit
of
acidity
there
fine
at
the
end
of
a
summer
day
moderate
aroma
of
hops
its
an
interesting
beer
with
a
distinctively
scottish
character
that
makes
a
great
switchup
from
your
regular
pint
and
easily
serves
in
allaspects

a
brilliant

done

d
it

cant

having

hadnt

it

my
favorite

appearance
was
darker
than
expected
and
did
not
have
the
brash
bitterness
that
often
comes
with
the
choice
of
a
pale
ale
the
hops
were
delightfully
balanced
and
gave
a
fresh
punch
at
the
front
of
my
mouth
and
finished
well
it
paired
exceedingly
well
with
a
medium
salsa
and
the
spice
of
south
american
cuisine
a
prime
drink
indeed
some
odd
notes
but
a

departs
from
the

im

the

ive
run

things
to

about

of

fulton
has
lost
me
as

while
this
is
a

i
certainly
would
not

for
it
for
my

fix
if
i
wanted
more
of

i
would
grab

c
some
advice
drink
this
one
slow
and
sip
hard
at
the
peak
distracted
by
other
endeavors
while
sipping
the
second
glass
the
warmth
opens
up
the
beer
more
than
a
bit
the
harshness
in
the
nose
and
taste
mellows
and
the
sweetness
grows
in
complexity
with
an
underlying
taste
somewhere
between
burnt
brown
sugar
and
black
strap
molasses
with
heavy
lace
on
a
beer
clean
glass
this
ipa
is
growing
on
me
by
the
pint
overall
not
an
overly
impressive
ipa
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
weird
i
dont
think
i
need
another
one
overall
a
very
memorable
english
ipa
like
this
umami
thick
and
rich
sweetness
and
hop
bitter
o
a
very
nice
english
ipa
exactly
what
it
should
be
balanced
with
earthy
hops
showing
through
the
pour
is
sort
of
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
white
head
quite
malty
and
sweet
with
minimal
hop
aroma
a
hint
of
floral
hops
and
maybe
a
touch
of
citrus
peel
the
flavor
is
similarly
lacking
in
the
hop
department
bread
and
toffee
are
the
prominent
flavors
with
a
little
caramel
too
mild
floral
hop
flavor
and
very
little
in
the
way
of
bitterness
final
thoughts
as
far
as
english
ipas
go
its
not
bad
theres
more
spice
in
this
brew
than
others
of
the
same
category
its
almost
a
hybrid
beer
wheat
and
ipa
id
probably
go
for
it
ontap
but
not
again
in
the
bottle
i
also
noticed
that
with
every
sip
the
taste
seemed
to
be
a
less
satisfying
however
if
you
are
a
big
fan
of
english
ipas
and
want
a
bit
of
a
change
from
the
everyday
beer
then
go
for
this
one
as
english
ipas
go
its
a
decent
one
but
probably
not
my
favorite
weak
flat
flavor
profile
doesnt
do
justice
to
either
style
this
tries
to
incorporate
no
real
off
notes
but
the
brewer
has
produced
a
bland
product
in
an
attempt
at
something
sessionable
pours
a
caramelish
orange
color
nose
is
floral
hops
with
some
caramel
malts
and
bubblegum
taste
starts
of
with
soft
citric
notes
that
fade
to
a
nice
caramel
grain
malt
there
are
some
notes
of
bubblegum
and
ends
with
a
nice
floral
earthy
citric
hop
flavor
medium
mouth
goes
down
well
overall
pretty
solid
english
india
pale
ale
worth
a
shot
nicely
balanced
but
probably
less
hoppy
than
most
ipa
connoisseurs
are
looking
for
o
very
solid
ipa
reminds
me
of
another
ipa
but
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
received
this
as
an
extra
and
always
excited
to
try
new
beers
however
i
would
of
guessed
this
to
be
more
an
english
mild
bitter
than
an
english
ipa
a
dark
copper
body
with
next
to
no
head
or
lacing
the
smell
is
very
sweet
with
mostly
caramel
and
bready
malts
cant
pick
out
any
hops
taste
is
just
as
swet
as
the
nose
making
this
a
malt
bomb
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
a
little
spice
like
a
mild
bitter
beer
if
you
like
sweet
beers
this
is
easy
drinkin
if
not
stay
away
and
dont
expect
much
for
hops
in
this
one
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
better
than
expexted
but
it
was
a
bit
too
malty
for
me
it
is
a
very
balanced
ipa
i
liked
this
one
better
on
tap
much
more
balanced
overall
rather
insipid
for
an
english
ipa
would
not
order
again
o
a
decent
ipa
not
a
palate
killer
by
any
stretch
which
works
well
for
it
but
there
is
a
nice
hop
presence
this
is
a
nice
representation
of
the
english
style
ipa
though
i
prefer
in
your
face
hoppiness
this
does
justice
to
its
style
was
really
excited
to
try
this
beer
got
it
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
but
damn
this
is
kennebunkportesque
in
terms
of
bad
for
an
ipa
the
thing
is
ive
had
numerous
kport
ipas
and
theyre
just
bad
this
beer
was
infected
so
hopefully
ill
have
another
opportunity
to
have
one
of
these
under
proper
conditions
o
a
pretty
decent
ipa
overall
unfortunately
the
subdued
aroma
really
holds
it
back
but
its
still
quite
tasty
with
a
pleasant
lively
body
o
this
is
a
good
english
ipa
with
a
touch
of
american
flair
nice
brew
from
fulton
pour
was
a
nice
dark
copper
with
a
half
finger
of
foam
that
dissipated
quickly
but
leaves
decent
lacing
smell
was
overall
very
mild
slight
hints
of
citrus
and
malt
and
something
metallic
as
well
taste
was
a
well
balanced
mildly
citic
hop
and
mild
sweet
malt
interplay
mildly
bitter
that
finishes
dry
and
clean
with
no
lingering
bitterness
medium
wellcrafted
body
with
good
level
of
carbonation
lets
one
know
this
is
a
craft
brew
overall
nothing
extraordinary
here
but
an
easy
drinking
mild
ipa
o
not
as
citrusy
or
hoppy
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
i
have
had
this
three
times
in
the
last
three
days
in
different
settings
and
this
is
by
far
my
best
experience
i
like
the
balance
and
the
slightly
different
take
to
this
just
know
going
in
this
is
not
going
to
be
a
big
west
coast
ipa
toasted
malts
and
minerallike
bitterness
up
front
orange
marmalade
and
mild
herbal
hop
flavors
follow
fruit
and
biscuit
malt
fill
up
the
palate
while
the
hop
flavors
and
bitterness
hang
out
in
the
background
becomes
mintier
and
vegetal
in
the
finish
nicely
balanced
with
subtle
hop
bitterness
and
a
very
nice
malt
profile
medium
bodied
with
a
very
creamy
feel
would
be
nice
to
have
this
on
cask
o
average
ipa
label
reads
where
do
we
go
now
and
i
say
more
hops
more
hops
more
hops
like
it
for
the
most
part
yeah
pours
a
nice
ambercopper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
very
quickly
recedes
into
a
thin
collar
the
nose
has
some
slight
floral
elements
along
with
a
lot
of
bread
and
some
caramel
very
reminiscent
of
dogfish
60
flavor
is
similar
with
more
of
a
malt
emphasis
even
for
an
english
ipa
this
is
really
malt
heavy
very
slight
dryness
to
the
finish
brew
itself
is
rather
chewy
decent
enough
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
overall
a
good
take
on
a
english
ipa
pretty
well
balanced
with
just
enough
hop
flavor
to
keep
it
from
becoming
bland
d
very
pleasant
beer
enjoyed
the
cask
a
great
deal
would
like
to
compare
the
cask
to
a
regular
tap
to
check
out
the
differences
im
feeling
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
maybe
i
had
unreasonable
expectations
due
to
my
anticipation
about
the
brewery
but
regardless
its
rather
dull
with
low
hop
presence
and
nothing
really
remarkable
wheres
the
flavor
o
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
it
was
much
much
better
i
was
at
a
beer
dabbler
event
so
i
didnt
bother
to
take
notes
or
write
reviews
on
it
this
however
is
a
much
different
beer
the
flavor
is
muted
and
the
hops
dont
dominate
like
most
ipas
this
is
more
of
a
strong
pale
ale
or
something
really
not
an
ipa
and
really
different
than
i
remember
it
being
on
tap
bottle
poured
into
perfect
pint
glass
have
tried
this
a
few
times
and
was
not
too
impressed
ill
now
chalk
that
up
to
the
other
beers
i
may
have
had
prior
to
drinking
this
aroma
is
bland
but
flavormouthfeel
are
spot
on
for
me
this
beer
could
get
lost
in
the
crowd
of
bigger
bolder
beers
but
definitely
a
nice
beer
to
start
the
night
out
with
or
if
youre
going
to
stick
with
one
beer
an
ok
brew
that
comes
pretty
close
to
the
english
style
ipa
with
a
bit
of
lacking
character
and
complexity
it
does
have
a
nice
simplicity
about
it
that
encourages
itself
to
be
a
good
session
brew
my
opinion
has
not
changed
about
this
beer
i
know
many
people
really
love
this
but
i
find
it
a
bit
timid
for
an
ipa
english
or
american
well
crafted
as
intended
and
the
bottled
product
matches
the
draft
exactly
medium
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
a
pretty
solid
ipa
although
it
could
easily
get
lost
in
the
crowd
o
this
is
not
the
greatest
ipa
ever
made
but
there
is
something
about
it
that
makes
me
want
more
i
prefer
it
on
tap
but
some
of
that
preference
may
have
come
from
having
the
sixer
sit
in
my
car
for
a
while
before
getting
home
to
enjoy
it
if
it
is
any
different
after
having
a
colder
one
i
will
editmy
review
accordingly
o
for
me
this
beer
was
a
great
nose
but
it
lacked
substance
pretty
much
everywhere
else
this
is
my
first
full
fulton
beer
recommended
definitely
worth
having
but
not
a
great
wow
factor
here
not
a
bad
beer
overall
i
think
i
need
to
give
this
one
another
go
just
wasnt
getting
it
going
here
nice
solid
drink
overall
worth
giving
it
a
go
and
probably
a
return
on
tap
at
bricks
pub
in
blaine
minnesota
this
beer
arrives
a
clear
amberorange
color
the
head
is
one
inch
of
white
foam
that
recedes
slowly
leaving
rings
of
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
until
the
beer
is
gone
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
floral
notes
and
grapefruit
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
a
bit
more
grapefruit
bitterness
is
rather
moderate
for
an
ipa
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
smooth
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
it
often
the
mix
of
floral
and
grapefruit
in
the
beer
really
makes
me
want
to
drink
an
ipa
that
is
completely
floral
its
got
a
decent
body
to
it
and
it
should
given
the
englishstyle
malt
bill
the
carbonation
is
also
solid
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
i
keep
using
that
word
because
thats
all
this
beer
is
it
isnt
good
exactly
not
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
it
is
above
average
with
no
real
flaws
apart
from
an
imbalance
towards
the
american
hop
flavors
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
fairly
tasty
british
ipa
although
so
by
the
strength
of
the
alcohol
then
the
hop
flavor
which
could
have
been
cranked
up
a
tad
even
if
it
was
still
the
appropriate
hop
bill
they
used
o
a
great
session
ipa
with
a
nice
floral
hop
taste
nicely
drinkable
a
nice
representation
that
i
will
order
again
the
glacial
hops
blend
well
with
the
malt
but
still
remain
at
the
forefront
of
both
smell
and
taste
it
tastes
a
lot
like
an
esb
might
if
you
juiced
up
the
bitterness
a
notch
clearly
letter
the
imbiber
know
that
hops
is
in
charge
i
love
balanced
beers
as
they
provide
me
the
best
drinking
experience
d
i
like
the
balance
in
this
beer
nice
malt
backbone
stands
to
support
the
nice
clean
bitterness
presented
by
the
american
hops
very
drinkable
at
6
4
nicely
fits
in
the
range
of
most
english
style
ipas
which
allows
having
a
few
but
has
a
great
american
take
on
it
with
the
hop
varieties
used
i
love
the
care
put
into
this
beer
the
restraint
to
keep
the
hops
at
a
level
that
is
not
over
the
top
is
commendable
keep
up
the
good
work
i
see
a
lot
of
new
beers
at
eds
but
this
is
one
of
best
of
the
summer
so
far
i
never
drank
this
before
but
i
was
instantly
impressed
by
the
flavor
profile
the
mango
and
bitterness
is
great
touch
with
the
malt
i
drank
a
few
of
these
like
others
have
said
it
can
make
you
a
bit
of
a
bar
fool
it
certainly
hits
i
will
continue
to
drink
and
enjoy
this
beer
dont
go
into
it
though
thinking
its
something
it
isnt
as
some
do
drinkability
very
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
ipa
great
flavor
overall
but
could
use
a
little
more
bitterness
so
i
need
to
dock
it
a
little
just
a
touch
too
balanced
for
my
ipa
tastes
d
very
pleasant
beer
enjoyed
the
cask
a
great
deal
would
like
to
compare
the
cask
to
a
regular
tap
to
check
out
the
differences
ive
enjoyed
this
a
few
places
around
minneapolis
its
always
reminded
me
bit
of
brooklyns
east
india
pale
ale
for
the
fruity
and
earthy
pairing
of
hop
flavors
with
a
soft
bitterness
really
this
is
a
more
sessionable
ipa
you
can
tell
it
has
body
and
a
little
more
alcohol
than
a
pale
ale
but
its
not
thick
or
overly
bitter
id
call
it
a
tasty
starteripa
certainly
worth
a
try
for
any
beer
lover
d
this
offering
although
light
and
mild
is
still
pretty
easy
to
drink
its
a
decent
brew
but
not
one
for
the
extreme
hopheads
overall
knocked
me
off
my
bar
stool
watch
out
world
fulton
will
bring
the
pain
killer
ipa
by
my
standards
excitedly
looking
forward
to
future
releases
from
the
little
guys
md
medium
to
lighter
body
carbonation
seems
a
touch
on
the
high
side
good
drinkability
though
due
to
the
balance
in
the
taste
and
the
crisp
finish
the
muted
hop
flavors
increase
the
drinkability
for
me
as
well
drinkablity
oh
yes
very
easy
to
drink
and
great
flavor
easily
a
session
beer
will
definitely
order
this
one
again
or
pick
some
up
at
the
store
as
a
summer
refresher
a
solid
beer
quite
drinkable
lower
bittering
sessionable
andlocal
all
the
better
copper
color
with
one
finger
head
nice
citrus
hop
scent
with
some
sweet
malt
pretty
balanced
taste
of
citrus
hops
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
feel
is
fine
almost
medium
bodied
mostly
smooth
a
bit
of
prickly
carbonation
easy
drinking
ipa
nothing
crazy
or
outstanding
just
a
solid
and
easy
going
ipa
i
would
welcome
this
again
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
me
but
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
ipa
and
another
good
brew
from
a
minnesota
brewery
overall
kind
of
disapointed
with
this
out
of
fulton
i
was
looking
for
a
really
citrus
and
floral
hopped
ipa
and
i
didnt
get
it
i
still
have
high
hopes
for
the
brewery
because
their
other
offerings
look
tasty
i
think
this
just
needs
to
be
tweaked
just
a
little
but
but
then
again
im
not
the
brewer
medium
mouthfeel
medium
to
high
carbonation
nice
bitter
finish
not
bad
but
not
the
best
i
have
had
either
i
wish
the
flavors
and
aroma
were
bolder
total
3950
overall
interesting
stuff
i
always
enjoy
interesing
poured
a
brown
color
with
a
strong
sweet
oak
mildly
hoppy
aroma
taste
was
big
sweetness
with
a
touch
of

just

on

worth
seeking
out
amazingly
tasty
englishstyle
ipa
an
interesting
beer
i
wonder
if
the
age
threw
this
one
out
of
whack
glad
to
have
tried
would
definitely
give
it
another
shot
the
feel
is
fantastic
a
firm
medium

shows
a
few
layers
of
depth
crispness
is
strong
yet
evens
out
a
running
smoothness
that
never
fades
it
starts
off
on
the
semisweet
side
and
transitions
easily
toward
dryness
as
it
works
such
that
you
dont
notice
the
transition
it
remains
very
clean
all
the
way
through
the
finish
which
lingers
just
as
long
as
it
should
borderline
english
barelywine
with
high
bitterness
and
moderate
complexity
just
not
enough
to
push
it
to
the
upper
echelon
of
ipa
or
maltier
styles
overall
great
beer
not
usually
to
much
of
a
fan
of
english
style
beers
but
i
think
this
us
great
maybe
because
most
3
floyds
beers
are
different
and
fantastic
had
another
bottle
618
still
love
it
a
3
floyds
favorite
for
me
taste
is
funky
too
bitter
hops
up
front
to
accompany
the
funky
smell
then
some
biscuity
malt
and
lots
of
malt
sweetness
funky
pale
bitterness
british
maybe
a
little
different
for
sure
would
i
buy
again
no
but
is
it
worth
a
try
definitely
a
solid
offering
but
really
not
worth
the
13
price
tag
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
does
not
hold
up
well
and
i
cant
really
see
where
the
oak
plays
a
part
in
adding
on
to
the
beer
to
be
honest
i
realize
that
its
a
historical
experiment
but
these
guys
already
make
great
enough
beers
to
convince
us
that
a
lot
of
their
experiments
are
as
unique
as
they
perhaps
truly
are
however
i
always
welcome
experimentation
in
brewing
nevertheless
i
would
gladly
revisit
this
in
a
fresher
condition
its
comforting
to
drink
and
has
a
unique
malt
profile
that
shines
above
the
hops
worth
trying
if
you
want
a
fff
fix
for
something
new
thick
off
white
single
finger
head
with
nice
lacing
on
a
hazy
golden
copper
body
aroma
is
malt
heavy
with
breads
tart
citrus
candied
orange
and
pine
resin
the
flavor
is
basically
the
same
and
follows
very
well
with
the
exact
same
experience
although
good
i
dont
really
understand
what
makes
this
one
english
it
may
use
english
hops
but
it
basically
came
out
as
a
malt
forward
aipa
from
my
experience
medium
to
full
body
and
moderate
carbonation
not
my
favorite
three
floyds
brew
i
love
big
hoppy
beers
but
i
think
the
hops
in
this
one
are
overdone
because
of
the
types
of
hops
used
here
the
english
hops
come
off
harsh
and
too
bitter
in
muddy
sort
of
way
and
the
malt
tastes
a
bit
too
thick
and
chewy
as
well
the
malt
and
hops
dont
balance
each
other
but
compound
the
assault
on
the
palate
with
no
contrast
in
sight
oh
well
not
to
my
taste
ps
bonus
points
for
a
cool
bottle
design
overall
this
is
quite
bitter
for
an
english
ipa
in
my
opinion
not
that
thats
a
bad
thing
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
not
sure
i
would
go
to
the
trouble
to
trade
for
it
because
i
cant
get
three
floyds
here
but
if
i
could
pick
one
up
off
the
shelf
i
would
not
bad
but
nothing
impressive
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
forgettable
in
my
opinion
three
floyds
nailed
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
as
usual
its
clear
that
the
craftsmanship
is
there
but
it
just
doesnt
pop
like
most
of
their
beers
o
different
than
the
american
ipas
that
im
used
to
but
great
none
the
less
a
very
floral
earthy
beer
that
is
quite
refreshing
this
beer
gets
better
every
time
i
drink
it
so
you
better
know
im
going
to
revisit
it
soon

three
floyds
blackheart
45
a
pretty
bitter
beer
here
i
really
enjoy
the
blackheart
it
is
kind
of
one
of
the
bastards
from
floyds
there
is
not
a
huge
demand
for
it
i
dont
know
why
i
think
it
is
a
amazing
beer
great
hop
notes
on
the
nose
and
a
strong
hopped
taste
as
i
mentioned
the
bitter
i
wouldnt
pass
this
one
up
as
it
is
very
consistent
every
year
as
well
o
great
beer
different
than
the
typical
dipa
with
a
lighter
crisper
more
flora
and
lemony
bite
overall
a
very
solid
english
style
ipa
worth
purchasing
again
o
enjoyable
3
floyds
take
on
a
classic
i
thought
the
hops
would
be
the
big
feature
but
i
was
surprised
by
the
maltiness
this
is
a
great
beer
to
cap
off
a
hard
week
the
warming
effect
is
pleasant
and
helps
make
each
sip
of
the
brew
more
enjoyable
o
unique
and
enjoyable
take
on
an
uncommon
ipa
style
for
the
money
though
i
prefer
fffs
standard
dipa
offerings
to
this
not
one
of
the
beers
that
make
3f
legendary
though
overall
not
only
is
this
a
unique
brew
its
also
really
amazing
so
many
levels
working
in
beautiful
harmony
together
fitting
i
reviewed
this
on
july
1st
because
there
is
something
thats
very
christmas
in
july
about
this
beer
wish
id
have
traded
for
more
of
these
everything
ive
imagined
in
an
oakaged
beer
can
we
have
more
of
these
please
and
less
boozybourbon
oak
aged
brews
overall
excellent
beer
the
subtle
oak
taste
was
perfect
and
really
made
this
beer
stand
out
looking
forward
to
having
more
poured
from
22oz
bomber
into
snifter
with
a
nice
hazy
golden
color
and
an
inch
head
that
dissipated
and
left
a
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
a
bit
weaker
than
i
was
expecting
getting
a
faint
citrus
smell
and
a
hint
of
wood
taste
is
a
bit
floral
and
lot
citrus
defintely
getting
some
oak
and
balanced
well
between
the
malt
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sticky
but
dry
medium
carbonation
finish
is
definitely
dry
and
bitter
great
offering
from
fff
im
liking
this
because
the
hops
are
definitely
coming
through
but
not
too
overpowering
trade
from
brewmane

it
should
be
thanks
to
the
aroma
there
just
isnt
any
worth
a
try
yikes
as
this
warms
up
it
the
alcohol
really
comes
out
like
vodka
or
rubbing
alcohol
flavor
that
is
unfortunate
be
sure
to
keep
it
cold
and
it
is
a
solid
beer
overall
tasty
refreshing
brew
the
aroma
and
flavor
keep
you
guessing
and
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
on
a
warm
summer
day
like
it
is
today
three
floyds
certainly
knows
what
they
are
doing
with
their
ipas
overalli
was
expecting
this
to
be
a
little
tones
down
compared
to
the
west
coast
stuff
but
its
really
a
totally
different
animal
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
three
floyds
but
for
the
price
i
dont
know
if
i
would
pick
it
up
again
10
bucks
for
this
bomber
is
a
bit
of
a
stretch
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
if
you
have
the
chance
i
recommend
you
do
to

this
is
one
that
im
very
glad
i
had
but
i
wont
be
seeking
out
again
im
always
amazed
at
just
how
clear
3f
gets
their
brews
and
this
is
no
exception
this
is
a
very
good
beer
nicely
balanced
in
flavor
overall
this
is
a
fine
departure
from
the
ipas
of
late
i
really
appreciate
the
atypical
hops
in
a
usbrewed

would
definitely
enjoy

one
again

im
fairly
surprised
that
ive
never
reviewed
blackheart
as
it
is
among
my
favorites
from
three
floyds
certainly
more
bitter
than
your
standard
english
ipa
this
brew
is
fairly
well
balanced
overall
and
the
oakaging
is
a
plus
brew

do
not
really
do
it
for

this
was
still
a

one
the
oak
was
a
nice
addition
actually
a
little
heavy
on
the
sweetness
but
a
good
eipa
nonetheless
another
great
beer
from
fff
overall
a
good
but
not
great
beer
for
me
just

it

cloying

from

thick

with
lots

light

o
boy
oh
boy
what
a
treat
not
your
normal
ipa
loaded
with
hops
and
bitterness
but
a
thick
in
the
mouth
gem
with
a
ton
of
flavor
its
a
delicious
masterpiece
and
offers
the
ipa
fan
a
change
in
direction
in
a
world
class
manner
its
a
fantastic
english
style
ipa
using
wonderful
english
yeast
hops
and
malt
flavors
are
a
bit
different
but
the
uses
of
malt
along
with
mellow
hops
are
on
the
same
base
and
just
plain
splendid
blackheart
continues
a
big
line
of
awesome
beers
the
guys
at
three
floyds
have
to
offer
nothing
but
world
class
here
this
is
a
straight
up
flavor
filled
enjoyment
of
an
ale
ill
buy
this
every
year
a
must
try
as
are
all
fff
brews
a
beautiful
looking
bottle
label
poured
a
clean
amber
with
a
perfect
2
fingers
of
off
white
heat
great
retention
greater
lacing
smells
of
cascade
hops
more
of
a
west
coast
smell
than
an
english
ipa
getting
a
hint
of
sweet
caramel
underneath
the
pine
smell
tastes
malty
sweet
and
slightly
bready
up
front
then
you
get
a
bitter
blast
of
hops
towards
the
finish
giving
you
a
pineycitrusy
grapefruit
taste
medium
body
with
a
nice
creamy
feel
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nice
warmth
from
the
alcohol
content
this
is
a
solid
ipa
regardless
of
not
really
sticking
to
the
tradition
english
ipa
i
think
they
should
consider
making
this
one
year
round
stands
up
strongly
next
to
arctic
panzer
wolf
overall
a
refreshing
and
delicious
beer
o
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
fff
id
have
it
again
overall
a
big
departure
for
three
floyds
but
they
pull
it
off
an
aggressive
take
on
an
english
style
the
hop
profile
gets
a
little
muddled
toasted
oak
was
an
interesting
touch
that
ended
up
hurting
the
beer
a
bit
in
the
long
run
i
think
the
best
part
is
that
it
goes
down
like
water
i
want
planning
on
chugging
it
but
it
went
down
so
smooth
with
such
a
nice
sweet
smooth
body
that
i
didnt
realize
i
was
ready
for
another
beer
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
copper
color
the
head
was
a
light
cream
color
with
a
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
good
balance
of
grainy
sweet
malts
along
with
the
dry
hop
aromas
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
good
amount
of
english
malt
flavors
with
a
sharp
hoppy
finish
to
it
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
pretty
typical
drinkable
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
finish
overall
this
beer
was
really
nice
in
my
opinion
overall
its
an
easy
drinker
not
any
one
things
asserts
itself
everything
works
well
with
everything
else
making
it
a
pretty
smooth
beer
for
and
ipa
so
high
in
abv
and
so
highly
hopped
overall
tasty
and
plenty
of
flavor
a
killer
job
on
a
english
ipa
the
malts
work
well
to
create
a
balanced
and
flavorful
beer
the
alcohol
is
also
nice
as
it
mixes
with
the
spices
to
create
a
intense
flavor
at
the
finish

overall
i
have
to
say
that
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
as
i
tend
to
not
really
go
for
english
ipas
the
flavor
profile
is
really
quite
multifaceted
and
interesting
id
like
to
see
this
beer
with
a
little
age
on
it
as
well
to
see
how
it
develops
ive
never
really
been
unhappy
with
any
fff
beer
this
one
is
great
the
sweetness
reminds
me
very
much
of
a
dfh
ipa
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
a
nice
beer
overall
cheers
o
wow
im
going
to
be
sad
to
see
this
one
go
so
so
good
well
done
boys
get
it
while
you
can
o
a
nice
hoppedup
version
of
your
normal
english
ipa
i
would
just
rather
drink
zombie
dust
or
dreadnaught
for
my
hops
kick
when
im
at
fff
but
this
is
a
nice
changeofpace
beer
with
a
hoppy
malty
balance
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
honestly
this
is
my
least
favorite
three
floyds
offering
that
ive
had
there
is
a
heavy
alcohol
taste
that
seems
quite
unbalanced
the
malt
is
rich
and
heavy
a
bit
of
a
roasted
taste
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
a
letdown
kudos
a
delicate
style
represented
so
well
by
the
bad
boys
of
indy
i
hope
to
enjoy
this
again
i
could
see
the
top
brass
saving
this
for
themselves
while
the
grunts
drink
the
watered
down
version
imperial
ipa
to
say
the
least
i
could
drink
this
again
without
issues
but
for
now
i
need
to
thank
liamt07

from
three
floyds
no
kidding
i
strongly
prefer
american
ipas
to
english
ipas
sorry
mother
country
and
therefore
i
have
to
say
this
is
far
from
the
best
ipa
fff
produces
technically
its
probably
one
of
their
worst
but
thats
like
saying
the
guy
who
finishes
last
in
the
u
s
open
or
the
british
open
is
among
the
worst
best
golfers
on
the
planet
if
you
are
a
fan
of
english
bitters
or
ipas
you
should
give
this
a
try
ill
probably
try
it
again
next
year
overall
3floyds
have
yet
to
disappoint
me
one
of
the
foremost
leaders
in
heavily
hopped
delicasies
i
would
recommend
this
to
any
beer
drinker
o
decent
ipa
but
nothing
really
sets
it
apart
from
the
other
high
abv
ipas
out
there
o
this
has
a
lot
of
english
ipa
character
but
the
finish
is
very
citrusy
and
tropical
fruit
like
there
are
a
lot
of
great
hop
flavors
and
malt
flavors
in
this
beer
but
the
beer
does
not
quite
blend
together
all
that
great
at
8
50
abv
the
alcohol
presence
is
stronger
than
i
expected
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
to
seek
out
but
it
tastes
like
it
has
a
little
bit
of
an
identity
crisis
a
hoppier
version
of
most
english
ipas
that
im
used
to
but
thats
expected
from
three
floyds
this
is
classic
3f
and
is
damn
delicious
overall
a
very
hop
forward
brew
with
an
interesting
underpinning
of
toasted
oak
not
aggressively
bitter
like
an
american
ipa
but
very
citrusy
on
tap
at
the
pub
served
in
a
half
pint
glass
color
is
orange
amber
with
a
head
that
settles
nicely
decent
lacing
aroma
is
bread
pine
and
toffee
flavor
is
toffee
biscuit
apricot
and
grapefruit
medium
mouthfeel
very
well
executed
nice
representation
of
the
style
o
a
pretty
nice
english
ipa
as
usual
for
fff
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
but
a
bit
pricey
at
12
o
this
is
a
pretty
awesome
ipa
unique
and
of
course
strange
i
prefer
arctic
panzer
wolf
over
their
other
ipas
but
i
like
this
one
and
all
their
others
will
be
buying
this
one
again
next
year
o
finishing
this
brewfest
strong
im
definitely
fond
of
blackheart
more
english
ipas
please
this
stuff
is
delicious
medium
yellowamber
color
with
very
little
head
aroma
is
very
nice
somewhat
light
but
still
good
levels
of
floral
hops
some
mild
spiceperfume
and
some
light
roasted
malts
very
subdued
flavor
is
very
nice
for
someone
like
myself
who
does
not
love
the
hop
bomb
as
much
as
the
average
person
good
floral
and
piney
hop
flavors
are
well
balanced
by
toasty
and
sweet
malt
flavors
pours
a
very
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
diminishes
quickly
scent
is
very
inviting
has
some
lovely
oak
aromas
to
it
kinda
reminds
me
of
burton
baton
with
much
less
hoppiness
english
malt
and
hop
aromas
with
more
oak
and
some
toffee
taste
is
wow
very
interesting
immediately
i
get
lovely
oak
flavors
with
some
strange
fruit
snack
flavors
not
too
much
hoppiness
as
im
pretty
sure
this
is
an
older
bottle
im
really
loving
the
oak
flavors
of
this
beer
great
citrus
as
well
orange
and
mango
a
nice
caramel
malt
backbone
to
this
with
some
lovely
butterscotch
and
toffee
there
is
some
hoppiness
but
very
minimal
compared
to
the
other
great
flavors
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
that
seems
proper
for
this
beer
drinkability
is
pretty
damn
high
overall
i
was
warned
by
people
that
this
beer
is
not
in
season
and
better
fresh
but
im
really
liking
it
o
this
is
a
great
take
on
the
ipa
the
toasted
oak
makes
the
brew
quite
unique
and
rounds
out
the
bitterness
you
expect
with
a
great
smokey
flavor
i
would
highly
suggest
picking
one
of
these
up
if
you
get
the
chance
d
solid
epa
really
sweet
fruity
and
delicious
i
am
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
and
wouldnt
hesitate
buying
it
if
i
saw
it
excellent
combination
of
ale
and
ipa
though
a
little
leaning
toward
the
ale
side
perfect
beer
for
an
afternoon
of
football
and
decorating
the
christmas
tree
enjoy
do
wellcrafted
but
unremarkable
this
beer
shows
ale
qualities
that
while
certainly
not
west
coast
are
still
more
american
than
english
it
is
most
in
need
of
a
more
aggressive
english
yeast
character
that
could
lend
some
estery
complexity
this
is
just
a
mess
of
a
beer
lacking
in
all
subtleties
and
balance
overall
flavorful
and
interesting
worth
a
try
it
poured
clear
with
a
good
inch
of
thick
head
the
coloring
is
a
darker
amber
than
most
ipas
the
smell
wasnt
quite
as
strong
as
i
had
hoped
hops
and
sugar
were
present
the
taste
however
was
in
full
force
so
many
flavors
that
complimented
each
other
like
a
great
meal
there
was
a
complex
breadiness
layered
with
brown
sugar
like
a
sweet
bread
add
to
that
a
solid
level
of
hops
and
floral
citrus
aroma
that
filled
my
sinuses
but
didnt
overwhelm
there
were
definite
levels
of
flavors
that
worked
together
but
didnt
cancel
each
other
out
it
had
obvious
english
characteristics
that
were
simply
accentuated
rather
than
covered
up
by
the
more
american
style
of
being
hopforward
throughout
it
was
very
smooth
and
drinkable
the
high
abv
sneaks
up
on
you
overall
it
was
both
the
most
flavorful
and
smoothest
english
ipa
i
have
ever
tried
and
all
at
9
hard
to
top
great
job
again
3f
not
my
favorite
fff
ipa
but
i
still
cherish
every
drop
very
nice
overall
this
is
on
the
above
average
end
of
bitterness
but
really
tasty
there
is
a
ton
of
flavors
floating
around
in
this
that
make
it
a
definite
worthy
try
for
anyone
who
can
get
it
a
great
example
of
fff
ipas
another
beer
from
fff
and
yet
another
one
i
cant
wait
to
try
again
does
that
place
ever
make
a
bad
brew
i
cant
seem
to
find
one
another
stellar
effort
cheers
a
solid
ipa
here
id
say
its
more
american
than
english
but
it
works
for
what
it
is
almost
barleywine
like
similar
to
other
3floyds
big
ipas
ive
had
worth
a
try
but
i
prolly
wouldnt
go
after
it
again
i
saw
a
man
buy
old
foghorn
for
25
today
for
a
6er
i
really
wanted
to
ask
how
he
could
justify
that
for
a
6er
of
ok
beer
the
thing
is
this
beer
is
39
for
a
6er
equivalent
and
well
i
cant
even
begin
to
accept
that
for
this
really
really
good
beer
o
quite
delicious
continuously
bitter
through
the
whole
beer
o
another
solid
ipa
from
fffs
i
dont
think
i
have
had
a
bad
one
this
was
in
the
fridge
for
a
couple
of
month
too
but
held
up
to
the
length
keep
it
up
floyds
a
pale
golden
amber
with
billowy
white
head
and
great
lacing
a
little
citrus
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
crackery
malt
the
malt
forward
beer
is
countered
with
minty
herbal
hops
with
a
nice
balmy
lingering
bitterness
this
is
a
great
beer
that
really
hides
the
9
abv
very
well
overall
this
was
underwhelming
not
as
bright
of
a
body
as
their
other
big
ipas
appropriate
for
the
english
style
big
frothy
and
lacy
white
head
that
pools
on
the
surface
of
the
body
with
its
bigness
body
is
darker
than
their
other
dipas
also
appropriate
for
the
english
style
aroma
has
a
lot
of
hops
but
still
a
bit
subdued
hard
to
decide
if
its
right
on
for
the
style
of
if
its
a
little
on
the
subdued
side
even
well
balanced
aroma
probably
less
hoppy
in
the
nose
than
alpha
king
which
is
pretty
dang
hoppy
without
that
typical
3fs
hop
zing
but
you
can
tell
there
were
massive
hops
in
the
boil
to
balance
the
huge
malt
some
complexity
on
the
tongue
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
great
and
overall
id
recommend
trying
this
beer
for
a
very
big
example
of
the
style
that
hides
the
alcohol
well
although
for
my
part
id
rather
be
drinking
a
dreadnaught
or
artic
panzer
wolf
right
now
for
the
price
sweet
malt
caramel
and
oak
dominate
the
hops
hang
around
the
whole
time
but
if
they
werent
bitter
they
wouldnt
stand
out
earthy
and
piney
but
they
fade
with
a
push
from
the
caramel
and
a
pull
from
the
oak
i
imagine
this
represents
the
long
journey
from
uk
to
india
but
you
wont
find
this
in
india
thats
for
darn
sure
overall
not
bad
nice
hops
but
not
quite
english
lots
of
nice
malts
and
sweet
sugars
to
balance
the
various
hops
sweetness
and
light
booze
tasty
and
drinkable
though
overall
this
has
got
to
be
my
least
favorite
from
fff
seasonal
lineup
they
make
much
better
ipas
and
i
am
not
particularly
fond
of
most
english
ipas
and
for
whatever
reason
wood
and
ipas
dont
really
mesh
for
me
o
pretty
good
but
id
probably
stick
with
dreadnaught
if
i
had
access
to
both
o
really
good
beer
a
different
avenue
for
fff
it
has
a
lot
of
aroma
coming
off
of
it
but
not
that
typicall
supernaturaldanky
citrus
kick
of
an
fff
ipa
or
ipa
in
disguise
i
look
forward
to
it
every
year
though
it
isnt
my
favorite
in
their
ipa
line
up
overall
three
floyds
markets
this
beer
as
an
english
style
ipa
but
it
seems
much
more
american
in
character
its
very
good
regardless
i
will
say
for
a
name
like
blackheart
i
expected
this
beer
to
be
a
black
ipa
once
i
got
over
my
disappointment
of
being
wrong
about
that
this
beer
is
quite
the
pleasant
surprise
slick
and
oily
medium
bodied
beer
finishing
dryly
fairly
well
balanced
beer
and
easy
to
drink
given
its
high
abv
overall
i
think
my
experience
with
english
ipas
was
pretty
minimal
so
this
was
a
very
welcome
surprise
an
incredibly
smooth
pleasant
ipa
another
winner
from
fff
huge
frothy
cotton
head
on
the
pour
body
is
a
light
orange
could
be
a
little
darker
smell
is
hugely
sweet
tropical
grapefruit
and
cotton
candy
a
twinge
of
sourness
on
the
end
of
the
nose
in
short
it
smells
awesome
i
cant
take
the
glass
away
from
my
nose
taste
is
very
bold
sweetness
with
the
cotton
candy
quality
carrying
over
and
yes
there
is
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
in
the
end
lots
of
grapefruit
and
tropical
notes
as
well
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
rich
and
creamy
the
beer
is
a
bit
hot
though
outstanding
beer
really
tastes
more
like
a
really
good
east
coast
dipa
than
an
english
one
hop
bitterness
is
much
more
amplified
seek
this
one
out
and
as
always
wish
i
bought
more
than
one
o
my
favorite
english
ipa
ive
had
the
oak
aging
provides
some
interesting
earthiness
and
sweetness
that
isnt
found
in
american
ipas
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
hop
heavy
dreadnaught
and
arctic
panzer
wolf
another
great
ipa
from
3
floyds
o
a
really
nice
change
of
pace
from
all
those
super
hoppy
west
coast
ipas
im
digging
the
way
the
caramel
sweetness
and
the
grassy
hoppiness
are
playing
marco
polo
together
id
love
to
try
this
fresh
sometime
o
d
an
interesting
beer
that
is
certainly
outside
the
realm
of
the
american
ipa
at
least
a
bit
nice
hops
interesting
flavor
profile
pretty
good
o
more
on
the
sweet
side
in
the
body
and
also
not
as
bitter
as
other
ipas
in
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavier
than
i
was
expecting
a
very
interesting
beer
makes
me
realize
that
i
enjoy
the
more
citrusy
flavors
of
the
american
ipas
o
this
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
very
well
balanced
and
it
stays
interesting
the
pressure
to
finish
this
growler
in
one
sitting
is
far
from
a
chore
overall
a
very
nice
ipa
a
little
strong
for
an
english
ipa
unless
they
are
aiming
for
something
closer
to
historic
versions
rather
than
modern
versions
worth
seeking
out
drink
i
like
the
three
floyds
stuff
this
was
another
good
offering
and
a
welcome
extra
i
could
drink
this
one
again
atmosphere
is
good
nice
enough
body
with
a
persistent
foamy
head
and
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
nose
has
a
distinct
difficult
to
place
at
least
for
me
combination
of
sweet
and
spice
components
with
the
hop
base
interesting
hop
that
is
not
too
biting
but
stands
out
with
its
earthy
character
sweet
and
spice
presents
here
too
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
o
love
this
beer
i
think
the
bomber
cost
me
10
but
id
say
thats
a
deal
for
what
youre
getting
here
if
you
see
this
one
dont
pass
it
up
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
3fs
offering
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pub
glass
the
look
of
it
is
not
what
i
expect
from
an
ipa
the
lacing
is
consistent
from
start
to
finish
the
smell
and
taste
is
amazing
from
the
hop
bitterness
to
the
malty
sweetness
a
very
enjoyable
beer
the
flavor
makes
it
easy
to
drink
overall
a
fantastic
beer
i
will
continue
to
keep
this
beer
at
the
top
of
my
wants
list
alright
in
a
night
that
i
sampled
the
majority
of
the
three
floyd
line
up
includining
the
legendary
dark
lord
this
beer
was
a
stand
out
the
newer
label
was
cool
as
hell
and
so
was
the
brew
a
nice
alburn
hue
with
good
lacing
the
nose
is
caramel
hops
with
a
smokey
oak
i
do
not
want
to
negate
actual
english
ipas
but
this
american
eipa
was
an
industry
standard
to
me
maybe
im
used
to
west
coast
hop
brews
but
either
way
this
is
an
amazing
beer
and
i
look
foward
to
drinking
it
many
more
times
good
day
o
a
superb
ipa
i
loved
it
the
balance
in
this
ipa
is
definitely
the
key
with
not
such
hop
forward
in
your
face
notes
its
all
about
the
sweet
pleasuring
fruits
lingering
with
the
hops
and
meshing
well
together
o
one
of
my
preferred
interpretations
of
an
english
ipa
even
though
its
not
really
all
that
english
still
a
nice
beer
o
i
really
like
this
beer
if
youre
after
something
pretty
complex
you
should
give
it
a
try
its
pretty
exciting
for
the
taste
buds
o
a
touch
muted
flavors
but
enjoyable
this
poured
a
dark
copper
almost
reddish
a
nice
1
finger
head
that
eventually
faded
to
a
strong
ring
of
bubbles
the
smell
is
good
instant
reminder
of
commodore
perry
a
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
a
good
sweet
bitter
at
first
then
hoppy
bitter
then
a
sweet
wettish
finish
there
is
lots
of
kick
from
the
carbonation
very
alive
jumpy
feel
the
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
for
the
price
id
almost
always
go
with
great
lakes
if
it
was
cheaper
than
12
and
some
change
for
a
22oz
it
would
great
more
attention
i
could
drink
this
till
bedtime
its
a
great
beer
but
pricey
in
my
area
i
feel
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
a
nice
bit
of
light
brown
head
smells
hoppy
and
malty
the
is
a
touch
of
chocolate
on
the
nose
sme
subtle
hops
on
the
nose
tastes
sweet
and
dry
lots
of
chocolate
on
the
tongue
dry
sweet
very
tasty
overall
good
solid
mouthfeel
overall
very
solid
a
style
im
not
particularly
familiar
with
but
very
pleased
with
wowow
more
like
a
triple
english
ipa
one
amazing
yummy
brew
by
3f
overall
this
is
another
fine
three
floyds
dipa
its
quite
a
bit
different
than
the
others
much
sweeter
but
still
with
plenty
of
hop
presence
soft
creamy
mouthfeel
upfront
flavors
of
fresh
oranges
ripe
pineapple
and
grapefruit
toasted
bread
hints
of
toffee
and
caramel
gives
it
a
touch
of
sweetness
malts
dominate
the
palate
with
toasted
oak
and
butter
kinda
tangy
throughout
the
beer
flowers
and
green
tea
has
a
good
hop
bitterness
with
pine
and
citrus
flavors
that
lingers
in
the
finish
overall
hmmm
english
ipa
maybe
not
for
me
drinkability
definitely
a
unique
taste
but
its
very
smooth
w
all
the
malt
and
hoppy
goodness
overall
i
love
this
beer
great
to
find
a
iipa
with
such
balance
i
will
stock
up
on
a
few
of
these
medium
mouthfeel
with
the
expected
hop
oil
texture
unusual
but
very
nice
brew
highly
recommend
this
one
o
i
enjoyed
this
brew
for
the
most
part
but
some
of
the
flavors
fell
a
little
flat
another
brewday
beer
cause
its
just
not
a
brewday
without
sampling
others
final
products
this
one
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
light
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
a
heap
o
pine
mint
grapefruit
rind
and
a
very
light
hint
of
caramel
hiding
in
the
background
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
the
pine
is
nicely
muted
a
bit
and
some
dark
toffee
moves
in
to
balance
things
out
much
better
than
the
caramel
in
the
nose
ever
could
the
body
is
a
lightish
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
creamy
feel
overall
a
great
eipa
if
the
pine
in
the
nose
werent
so
sharp
id
bet
this
would
be
downright
outstanding
still
pretty
enjoyable
regardless
though
d
i
could
put
down
a
few
this
beer
pours
a
golden
body
with
a
thin
coarse
white
head
on
the
surface
the
aromatics
have
lots
of
piny
hops
backed
by
what
appears
to
smell
like
a
bit
of
caramel
the
first
sips
confirm
what
the
nose
has
suspected
this
beer
has
a
heaping
helping
of
piny
hops
but
they
are
not
overwhelmed
by
the
caramel
malt
base
and
visa
versa
this
is
how
i
like
ipa
this
beer
has
balance
the
hops
provide
a
good
strong
deal
of
bitterness
that
could
be
offputting
to
those
who
dislike
the
style
but
for
those
who
enjoy
hops
this
is
pretty
darn
tasty
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
balanced
ipas
that
ive
had
the
good
fortune
of
putting
on
my
palate
this
brews
color
is
clean
gold
and
has
a
fingers
worth
of
white
head
the
nose
has
notes
of
vanilla
oak
resinous
pine
and
an
ample
amount
of
booze
this
has
a
great
oak
characteristic
that
opens
up
to
some
sweet
caramel
honey
and
vanilla
tones
the
hops
create
a
strong
bitterness
that
is
balanced
with
tge
sweet
malty
offerings
great
fullbodied
mouthfeel
that
is
smooth
and
ends
dry
just
had
this
on
tap
at
fff
today
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
there
was
a
mild
oaky
taste
to
it
with
fruity
undertones
i
dont
drink
scotch
but
it
had
the
scotch
taste
without
the
burn
bought
some
extra
bombers
to
take
home
once
again
fff
doesnt
disappoint
amazing
get
this
beer
d
this
is
a
great
brew
by
fff
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
i
suppose
it
needs
to
be
to
stand
up
to
that
wall
of
hops
id
repeat
thanks
to
hurfer
for
the
bottle
poured
from
22oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
glass

and

for

had

from

amazing

that
reduces
to
a

that

of

taste
of

pineapple

with
a
delayed
bitterness
of

and
grapefruit
that
lingers
for
a
while
after
the
finish
showing
a
strong
use
of
hops
very
well
balanced
flavors
and
it
definitely
reminds
me
of
the
dreadnaught
dipa
from
them
medium
carbonation
and
a
mediumfull
body
absolutely
no
notice
of
the
alcohol
content
overall
this
is
outstanding
and
i
really
hope
they
start
to
distribute
back
to
ohio
because
everything
i
have
had
has
been
a
great
experience
delicious
d
i
find
this
to
be
a
less
tense
version
of
dreadnaught
another
fantastic
beer
by
fff
it
has
the
right
blend
of
floral
and
hop
ingredients
to
not
only
make
it
smell
great
but
taste
good
as
well
i
definitely
recommend
this
beers
to
others
this
is
a
very
flavorful
beer
and
overall
quite
enjoyable
the
9
abv
is
not
that
noticeable
but
after
2
pints
youll
be
aware
this
is
a
strong
beer
maltier
than
the
aroma
led
me
to
believe
but
still
good
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
leads
off
with
some
malt
sweetness
its
good
but
a
little
unexpected
it
kind
of
tastes
like
a
big
dipa
from
the
east
beer
only
has
a
moderate
bitterness
to
it
drinkability
suffers
due
to
the
weight
of
the
whole
thing
i
like
it
but
i
think
ive
had
better
english
ipas
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
for
9
percent
too
sweet
even
for
an
english
ipa
for
my
tastes
67th
overall
ive
only
had
a
few
english
ipas
but
this
might
be
the
best
ive
had
i
really
like
the
style
as
im
not
a
huge
hop
head
if
you
like
english
ipas
give
this
one
a
try
9
alcohol
very
well
hidden
around
face
edge
nice
darkerish
fruity
hop
aroma
very
fresh
very
delightfully
sweet
smell
perhaps
from
malt
but
extremely
well
blended
taste
is
extremely
fruity
more
on
the
peach
and
apricotty
side
grassy
finish
not
super
dry
swish
reveals
the
alcohol
not
very
evident
in
the
least
pretty
awesome
for
style
much
darker
color
wise
and
smell
wise
than
the
dreadnaught
absolutely
amazing
some
caramel
notes
in
warmth
very
ligh
fruity
finish
in
warmth
hides
heaviness
well
recommend
overall
pick
some
up
if
you
can
somewhat
pale
amber
color
a
brief
haze
quickly
dissappeared
into
a
quite
clean
looking
beer
ok
sized
fluffy
white
head
that
fades
rapidly
very
freshly
mown
grass
aroma
big
hop
blast
upfront
though
not
overly
astringent
just
a
ton
of
hop
flavor
followed
by
a
lingering
bite
some
good
caramel
malt
sweetness
lingering
caramel
like
quality
soft
mouthfeel
going
down
way

very
easy
drinking
and
damn
pleasant
all
around
9
where
d
very
great
best
english
i
know
its
not
made
in
england
ipa
ive
had
to
date
love
this
beer
even
though
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
i
cant
say
that
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
it
the
9
abv
while
fun
is
limiting
theres
also
something
about
these
english
style
ipas
that
just
dont
sit
perfectly
with
me
theyre
good
really
good
in
fact
but
i
just
prefer
the
american
versions
that
said
this
beer
is
very
good
go
get
some
overall
i
really
liked
this
one
i
ha
no
clue
how
strong
it
was
which
made
it
even
better
drinks
like
a
champ
and
went
over
quite
well
i
probably
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
bomber
and
am
not
especially
eager
to
get
another
one
of
these
the
alcohol
is
just
too
strong
not
my
favorite
three
floyds
not
even
close
but
it
was
good
to
try
d
a
nice
take
on
the
style
with
a
definite
american
twist
drinks
about
right
for
the
abv
drinkability
an
excellent
eipa
if
this
is
what
the
onboard
officers
enjoyed
while
at
sea
sign
me
up
you
like
hops
this
is
worth
a
shot
i
mean
cmon
its
a
double
ipa
from
the
makers
of
dreadnaught
thanks
to
mbauer
for
this
one
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
snifter
it
has
a
hazy
orange
pour
with
a
moderate
sticky
white
head
tons
of
floral
hops
on
the
nose
the
flavor
is
very
hoppy
lots
of
floral
and
grassy
hops
hints
of
citrus
a
full
bodied
beer
with
a
sticky
mouthfeel
well
carbonated
i
really
could
not
taste
the
oak
and
i
am
not
sure
this
is
an
english
ipa
what
i
do
know
is
it
is
a
great
beer
worth
seeking
out
d
again
after
a
bomber
im
still
going
this
is
another
good
brew
but
not
to
the
likes
of
arctic
panzer
wolf
id
drink
it
again
notes
this
got
easier
to
drink
the
longer
i
sipped
it
the
advertised
british
style
threw
me
off
they
may
have
used
english
ingredients
but
this
could
pass
for
any
well
made
dipa
this
is
to
say
that
good
ipas
are
universal
not
that
british
offerings
are
inferior
i
was
expecting
something
akin
to
stones
emperial
but
im
definitely
not
complaining
given
that
ipas
were
birthed
in
britain
i
would
like
to
think
the
beer
making
its
trek
from
london
to
bombay
tasted
something
like
this
first
bottle
of
three
floyds
yep
lives
up
to
the
hype
amazing
ale
blackheart
pours
with
a
rich
thick
head
and
longlasting
lacing
the
brew
is
a
bit
darker
than
your
average
ipa
a
rich
mix
of
amber
and
honey
the
scent
is
strongly
citrus
with
grapefruit
being
the
star
there
is
also
a
bit
of
tangerine
in
the
background
and
a
touch
of
honey
on
taste
there
is
a
lot
more
resiny
malt
than
one
may
expect
which
lends
a
subtle
not
cloying
brownsugar
sweetness
to
each
sip
while
the
flavor
dominates
throughout
the
hops
in
the
brew
do
strongly
surface
with
predominant
tastes
of
lemon
and
pine
carbonation
is
quite
good
with
this
one
providing
a
strong
presence
throughout
though
never
overpowering
the
brews
subtleties
this
is
definitely
a
great
beer
with
its
strength
being
in
the
balance
of
the
flavors
and
a
taste
profile
that
is
a
welcome
variant
to
the
singlefocused
hop
brews
currently
taking
center
stage
in
craft
beer
which
is
certainly
not
a
bad
thing
but
variation
is
good
this
is
my
favorite
so
far
from
3f
my
bottle
was
a
bit
old
but
this
is
still
a
standout
for
an
underappreciated
style
hop
bombs
are
not
necessary
j
great
iipa
very
drinkable
barely
notice
the
abv
very
tasty
and
not
normal
overall
tastey
unique
type
of
ipa
three
floyds
is
great
at
taking
a
style
and
deconstructing
it
into
a
new
work
of
art
blackheart
is
no
exception
a
pineapple
smelling
sweet
yet
bitter
tasting
booze
bomb
not
exactly
what
id
call
a
traditional
english
ipa
d
damn
drinkable
great
brew
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
some
more
of
these
the
next
time
i
see
them
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
as
of
now
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
i
am
not
a
big
ipa
or
dipa
kinda
guy
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
malt
forward
english
take
on
the
style
by
3
floyds
pretty
damn
good
brew
that
i
would
drink
again
bottle
pours
a
slightly
hazed
orange
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
malty
with
some
oak
notes
int
he
nose
very
minimal
hops
presence
in
the
taste
more
malts
than
anything
medium
mouthfeel
matly
upfront
with
some
citrus
rind
notes
in
the
end
some
lemon
tastes
as
well
to
me
it
has
an
odd
lingering
taste
d
englishstyle
ipas
are
my
thing
and
this
is
the
best
of
them
quite
simply
the
best
ipa
ive
ever
tasted
drinkability
while
having
slight
flavor
issues
that
detract
from
the
style
they
are
claiming
this
is
an
excellent
pint
that
i
would
love
to
enjoy
at
the
brewery
if
i
were
to
make
a
tour
there
i
am
pleased
i
have
another
bottle
and
will
be
sure
to
enjoy
this
with
friends
its
a
bit
sweet
but
i
could
finish
this
bomber
and
probably
another
before
getting
sick
of
it
d
very
interesting
though
not
something
id
typically
crave
the
beer
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
caramel
malt
with
some
flowers
and
perfume
notes
the
flavor
is
very
heavy
on
the
caramel
malt
but
i
also
get
some
orange
citrus
grass
and
flowery
hops
the
bitterness
is
about
medium
a
very
good
aroma
and
flavor
combination
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
another
good
beer
from
three
floyds
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
overall
a
unique
ipa
that
is
of
great
quality
kind
of
wish
i
would
have
picked
up
more
i
am
enjoying
the
hell
out
of
this
one
d
i
love
3fs
beer
but
not
sure
if
i
love
the
bh
i
think
this
beer
is
a
little
to
malty
for
me
d
i
think
that
if
i
were
going
for
an
english
ipa
i
would
not
get
this
one
again
for
the
reason
that
it
is
too
floralcitrus
hoppy
but
none
the
less
very
enjoyable
d
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
major
difference
between
english
ipas
and
american
is
that
the
english
is
more
balanced
and
has
a
more
pronounced
malt
flavor
that
is
the
case
with
blackheart
as
well
but
at
9abv
i
think
the
addtional
malt
that
is
in
this
beer
teeters
on
being
a
barleywine
this
is
a
easy
drinking
good
beer
overall
this
tasted
so
much
like
so
many
others
of
the
ipa
style
that
i
found
it
forgettable
it
seems
like
the
syrupy
maltcitruspine
hop
combination
is
becoming
very
common
among
american
craft
breweries
that
produce
stronger
ipa
styles
what
id
like
to
see
in
this
beer
as
a
supposedly
englishinspired
style
would
be
a
leaner
body
not
necessarily
lighter
just
drier
not
so
excessively
sugary
and
sticky
a
drier
body
combined
with
a
more
earthy
herbal
or
spicy
choice
of
hop
flavors
rather
than
the
commonly
used
pinecitrus
would
to
me
taste
closer
to
an
english
style
and
wouldnt
eclipse
the
barrel
aging
so
much
while
this
was
an
affable
enough
beer
for
someone
with
a
taste
for
ipas
the
beentheredrankthat
experience
wasnt
worth
the
high
price
to
me
roughly
twice
that
of
nearly
all
other
bombers
at
the
store
including
those
of
comparable
style
this
is
a
very
complex
flavorful
beer
the
booze
holds
down
the
drinkability
a
little
but
overall
a
great
offering
and
another
winner
from
the
3f
guys

if

then
dont

to
invite

to
your

d
while
not
quite
an

this
was
still
very
enjoyable
and
something
i
would
seek
out
again

big

and
a

different
from
the
typical
ipa
let
alone
an
eipa
ultimately
a
bit
too
sweet
but
still
well
worth
seeking
out
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
an
english
ipa
it
is
not
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
i
really
like
a
good
english
ipa
if
its
done
right
and
this
one
is
its
earthy
and
hoppy
and
bitter
as
hell
while
bringing
a
nice
cask
feel
to
it
well
done
3f
d
drank
quite
well
and
was
surprised
at
the
hop
and
booze
bite
to
be
considered
a
english
style
ipa
honestly
its
a
west
coast
style
ipa
from
the
midwest
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
a
bit
lower
for
me
its
the
style
not
this
particular
brew
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
example
of
an
english
ipa
it
just
not
my
bag
skal
notes
i
wasnt
exactly
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
beer
since
it
is
9
and
more
intense
than
your
average
and
somewhat
mild
english
ipa
does
that
make
it
a
true
english
ipa
as
it
was
when
it
really
was
sent
to
india
or
is
it
simply
a
imperial
english
ipa
based
on
what
i
have
tasted
i
would
say
its
a
marriage
of
dipa
and
english
ipa
however
maybe
old
english
ipas
really
were
like
this
if
so
brew
more
please
4
0
d
english
styles
for
the
most
part
arent
my
thing
but
this
was
a
good
one
good
taste
and
a
great
mouthfeel
make
this
one
quite
palatable
d
this
one
was
easy
to
drink
for
sure
and
creeped
on
me
for
sure
very
glad
to
finally
have
gotten
a
hold
of
a
couple
of
these
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
about
an
inch
frothy
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
pretty
good
aroma
is
floral
and
citrusy
grapefruit
tropical
fruit
hops
along
with
some
caramel
and
bready
malt
the
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
but
theres
also
a
little
bit
of
oak
noticable
theres
a
decent
balance
between
the
hoppy
and
malty
flavors
and
theres
a
lingering
bitter
hoppy
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
slick
and
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
decent
its
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
i
think
this
is
an
ok
brew
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
d
for
an
ipa
this
beer
is
heavy
on
the
tongue
and
the
liver
making
on
bomber
plenty
d
not
d
i
took
my
time
but
this
very
easy
to
drink
a
perfect
match
for
a
cooler
summer
evening
blackheart
is
yellow
in
color
with
a
fair
head
and
ok
lacing
heavy
aromas
of
oak
dominate
the
nose
the
beer
is
tangy
hoppy
and
easily
identifiable
as
being
in
the
english
style
again
oak
is
very
present
throughout
the
taste
the
beer
has
a
decent
feel
although
it
was
decent
a
small
pour
was
plenty
for
me
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
want
to
consume
in
quantity
a
bit
odd
they
hit
the
mark
for
an
english
ipa
hops
flavor
profile
big
smack
of
bitterning
hops
up
front
then
well
not
much
followup
the
high
abv
certainly
gives
the
beer
a
sense
of
horsepower
but
nothing
else
really
steps
up
after
the
first
hops
onslaught
not
bad
by
any
means
but
not
as
complex
as
3fs
usually
pulls
off
it
smooth
and
drinkable
and
very
easy
to
drink
great
ipa
md
not
the
most
drinkable
you
can
taste
the
high
abv
but
still
a
very
tasty
brew
not
sure
what
happened
with
this
beer
the
first
bottle
i
bought
was
clearly
not
a
pale
ale
of
any
sort
it
poured
thick
and
black
thats
what
she
said
and
tested
woefully
of
salt
and
venom
my
frost
guess
would
be
that
a
stout
was
put
in
by
mistake
but
being
that
a
this
is
three
floods
and
they
do
not
half
ass
or
fuck
up
b
their
stout
option
is
dark
lord
show
caps
where
respect
is
due
and
c
i
havent
ruled
out
that
the
ghetto
ass
liquor
store
where
i
got
it
might
have
skunked
it
i
am
willing
to
overlook
my
first
bad
experience
with
a
three
floods
beer
it
smells
and
tastes
like
an
ipa
but
a
more
refined
one
guess
thats
where
the
english
thing
comes
into
play
better
than
average
though
not
great
the
best
part
about
this
veer
is
its
potency
granted
9
isnt
quite
barley
wine
but
its
still
a
strong
friggin
ale
would
i
buy
it
again
yes
soon
eh
d
not
too
bad
something
about
the
taste
leaves
me
not
necessarily
wanting
tons
of
this
beer
drinkability
this
pairs
extremely
well
with
the
aged
spanish
goat
cheese
i
am
snacking
on
each
flavor
really
helps
to
bring
out
the
other
this
is
quite
an
enjoyable
brew
as
an
ipa
lover
i
like
that
it
is
different
than
most
other
u
s
ipa
offerings
i
really
enjoyed
this
big
flavorful
brew
this
is
something
i
could
sip
on
night
after
night
thanks
alushia
for
bringing
me
the
bomber
portsmouth
sounds
phat
im
generally
not
a
huge
fan
of
english
ipas
i
tend
to
prefer
their
american
counterparts
but
this
was
a
very
solid
beer
the
hoppiness
seemed
way
cranked
up
although
there
is
definitely
still
a
balance
with
the
malt
backbone
the
8
abv
seemed
well
hidden
and
snuck
up
on
me
a
bit
as
i
drank
it
resulting
in
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
certainly
try
again
medium
bodied
smooth
medium
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
hard
to
believe
this
is
a
9
00
abv
beer
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
wish
it
was
available
year
round
pours
a
beautiful
ripe
peach
color
with
12
finger
head
and
a
creamy
ring
that
both
sticks
around
and
looks
very
fresh
the
smell
is
floral
with
grapefruit
pineapple
mango
peach
and
other
tropical
fruitsgrass
and
some
great
caramel
malts
wow
this
is
fantastic
dipa
with
mango
up
front
then
hops
and
grapefruit
hit
you
then
some
more
tropical
fruit
notes
with
some
grassy
notes
it
finishes
with
nice
full
sweet
malts
that
balance
it
out
it
was
fantastic
and
fresh
mouth
feel
is
mediumfull
with
tastes
all
over
the
palate
this
bomber
is
disappearing
as
i
write
this
its
an
awesome
dipaipa
it
rivals
dreadnaught
very
very
good
highly
recommended
this
is
also
available
in
bombers
right
now
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
would
like
a
grownups
ale
no
gimmicks
just
highquality
english
ale
drinkability
is
good
high
abv
make
itself
known
about
halfway
through
but
its
still
a
good
one
to
sip
i
like
it
and
would
drink
a
couple
of
bottles
in
a
row
but
very
slowly
and
not
driving
anywhere
d
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
enjoyed
the
floral
and
fruity
hops
would
like
to
try
again
612010
i
really
wish
i
could
get
this
at
home
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
couldnt
get
enough
of
the
beer
pours
a
bright
solid
orange
color
with
good
head
retention
and
considerable
sticky
lacing
all
around
really
this
ipa
just
looks
terrific
on
the
nose
this
beer
immediately
reminds
me
of
the
alpha
king
but
with
more
orange
citrus
and
less
noticeable
sweet
malt
all
positive
differences
in
my
book
flavor
profile
replicates
the
nose
but
the
sweet
malt
in
this
beer
completely
dominates
the
hoppy
bitterness
theres
certainly
plenty
of
hoppy
bitter
goodness
in
this
beer
its
very
prominent
and
noticeable
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
the
sweetness
in
this
beer
that
really
stands
out
on
the
other
hand
while
the
mouthfeel
is
comes
across
as
sweet
and
rich
and
relatively
full
im
impressed
by
how
well
integrated
the
alcohol
is
in
this
beer
you
can
certainly
tell
the
abv
is
up
there
but
the
beer
is
not
the
least
bit
heavy
or
tiring
on
the
palate
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
overdone
i
think
which
ultimately
hurts
the
beers
drinkability
just
a
bit
but
nevertheless
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
its
not
my
favorite
syle
of
ipadipa
but
nevertheless
i
thought
this
a
very
solid
beer
drinkability
three
floyds
sets
the
bar
high
with
their
bottled
offerings
especially
in
the
hops
department
and
this
one
certainly
makes
the
grade
floral
delicate
smooth
but
with
enough
hop
bitterness
to
be
assertive
and
wellrounded
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
double
ipa
that
shows
that
theres
more
to
the
style
than
ordeal
by
hop
resin
overall
a
nice
one
to
try
and
another
good
beer
from
three
floyds
drinkability
the
abv
is
apparent
here
but
its
very
nicely
brewed
and
in
general
a
well
crafted
beer
it
tastes
a
lot
healthier
than
it
probably
is
and
its
hard
to
drink
at
a
slow
pace
its
so
delicious
this
is
a
great
english
ipa
but
the
hop
character
takes
on
an
unexpected
citrus
note
from
columbus
hops
creating
an
interesting
interplay
with
the
very
englishlike
esters
still
the
toasted
oak
contributes
little
d
this
is
a
good
beer
but
a
22oz
is
enough
for
me
fff
does
a
good
take
on
a
english
ipa
nothing
to
extreme
for
this
brewery
and
its
a
refreshing
thing
for
once
dig
the
new
label
this
thing
had
some
of
the
stickiest
lacing
ive
ever
seen
awesome
beer
to
a
style
i
just
dont
drink
enough
of
now
if
we
can
just
get
3floyds
bombers
for
less
that
12
plus
10
25
tax
in
the
city
the
beer
was
as
described
it
is
a
hopped
up
beer
using
english
floral
hops
instead
of
the
typical
american
hops
there
was
still
the
malt
profile
youd
expect
in
an
english
ipa
but
obviously
with
a
greater
prominance
given
to
the
hopping
i
didnt
know
what
the
abv
was
but
i
found
it
quite
drinkable
and
i
finished
my
glass
in
minutes
this
beer
has
been
sitting
in
the
back
of
the
cooler
at
work
for
almost
a
year
today
the
boss
finally
knocked
the
price
down
low
enough
that
i
could
afford
to
take
a
one
home
it
pours
a
coppery
color
with
a
nice
dense
head
the
beer
also
has
a
really
nice
cascading
effect
when
it
is
poured
as
i
was
looking
at
the
beer
the
hop
aroma
was
aready
drifting
out
to
my
nose
its
sweet
smelling
possibly
floral
with
sweeter
malts
coming
through
the
taste
is
exellent
up
front
is
this
great
hop
bite
that
rolls
into
malty
sweet
back
bone
for
me
this
beer
has
a
great
balance
no
one
part
takes
the
other
another
great
beer
from
three
floyds
skål
again
mint
on
finish
first
ipa
my
fiance
has
liked
btw
drinkability
is
good
but
more
of
a
sipper
since
this
brew
is
9
abv
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
its
pretty
drinkable
especially
for
9
its
not
your
typical
ipa
for
sure
it
has
a
lot
of
barleywine
characteristics
so
it
might
not
be
for
everyone
very
tasty
though
if
you
like
those
flavors
a
pretty
good
beer
all
around
to
me
this
is
one
highoctane
english
ipa
delicious
drinks
too
easy
would
never
believe
this
was
9
0
abv
plus
nails
the
style
to
the
98th
percentile
as
far
as
my
minds
eye
was
getting
shipped
to
british
troops
back
in
the
day
great
effort
from
fff
thick
beer
almost
syrup
like
sweetness
that
clings
a
bit
to
much
medium
body
dont
think
i
would
go
after
another
to
sweet
for
my
likeing
drinkability
is
hurt
by
the
bitterness
flavors
are
nice
authentic
but
just
a
bit
huge
and
in
your
face
just
a
bit
out
of
balance
and
maybe
a
bit
big
for
some
of
these
particular
flavors
nice
little
beer
here
the
alcohol
was
noticeable
but
not
overly
distracting
i
havent
been
a
huge
fan
of
english
ipas
in
the
past
but
this
one
has
broken
the
mold
and
is
definitely
the
best
of
the
style
that
i
have
tried
buy
it
if
you
see
it
thank
you
to
fidel904
for
this
one
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
white
foamy
head
with
long
lasting
sticky
lacing
not
sure
on
the
age
of
the
bottle
i
assume
that
it
is
from
this
year
so
i
guess
that
makes
it
5
months
old
smelling
and
tasting
some
of
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
backbone
in
a
yummy
way
probably
wasnt
pronounced
when
the
beer
was
fresh
but
its
here
now
and
im
not
complaining
some
of
this
sweetness
is
also
probably
derived
from
the
oak
barrel
the
british
hops
are
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
usual
hop
profiles
that
i
love
in
america
ipas
i
guess
there
isnt
a
category
for
english
double
ipa
or
this
beer
would
be
in
it
im
sure
great
beer
wish
fff
was
available
in
florida
maybe
one
day
id
be
hard
pressed
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
bad
boys
though
as
a
stand
alone
drink
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
more
interesting
brews
ive
had
to
date
pours
a
dark
goldbronze
with
a
nice
white
head
and
some
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
hops
and
the
oak
completely
dominate
the
nose
in
a
good
way
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
of
a
disappointment
after
the
nose
with
the
hops
and
the
oak
not
blending
quite
enoughin
fact
even
though
this
is
an
ipa
im
almost
tempted
to
commit
the
cardinal
sin
and
age
this
one
for
a
while
to
see
what
develops
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
for
the
style
but
well
within
range
drinkability
is
somewhat
hampered
by
what
i
feel
might
be
a
little
too
much
oak
for
what
it
is
right
now
d
a
really
good
fff
offering
that
could
use
a
little
more
malt
depth
to
be
a
masterpiece
it
is
still
a
unique
beer
with
its
floral
and
citrus
tinged
fruity
sweetness
d
a
very
unique
yet
interesting
ipa
that
is
rather
sweet
it
surprised
me
with
its
over
the
top
malting
which
makes
it
more
like
an
old
ale
but
why
follow
the
rules
great
stuff
poured
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
two
finger
head
that
faded
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
citrus
not
a
surprise
from
the
boys
at
fff
the
taste
was
hoppy
orange
and
bitter
at
the
start
and
finish
with
malty
sweet
in
the
middle
the
feel
was
medium
bodied
and
oily
with
sufficient
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
if
memory
serves
me
blackheart
reminded
me
of
fffs
barleywine
pours
a
very
nice
slightly
hazy
orange
copper
hue
very
frothy
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
head
decreases
over
time
but
leaves
a
nice
ring
i
can
taste
hints
of
pineapple
malty
slightly
hoppy
but
not
overdone
fruity
prunish
pineapple
smells
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
makes
me
wish
i
had
a
case
for
the
big
game
tommorrow
an
english
ipa
at
9
abv
alrighty
then
the
pour
results
in
a
orange
slightly
hazy
fluid
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
the
head
has
good
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
heavy
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
claim
is
all
english
ingredients
three
floyds
must
of
used
the
english
ingredients
i
do
not
like
where
are
the
floral
and
herbal
hops
i
adore
instead
we
get
sickly
sweet
aroma
and
taste
that
is
overly
sweet
and
citric
tangerine
pineapple
sweet
malt
honey
all
via
for
attention
from
the
senses
has
alcohol
warming
in
the
finish
the
aging
on
oak
does
add
some
interesting
components
if
you
can
get
by
the
sweetness
adds
a
slight
wood
and
vanilla
flavor
the
body
is
medium
with
a
slick
oily
texture
more
like
a
barley
wine
than
a
pale
ale
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
i
love
english
style
ales
but
this
is
went
into
a
direction
i
did
not
like
nicely
drinkable
i
find
this
nice
for
an
oaked
ipa
ive
always
preferred
the
freshness
of
america
ipas
vs
the
toasted
more
muted
nature
of
english
ipas
looks
good
with
a
copper
color
great
clarity
and
very
little
head
the
aroma
is
a
complex
mix
of
oak
alcohol
toasted
malt
and
nuts
the
flavor
is
quite
intense
with
oak
and
alcohol
in
the
lead
giving
it
a
bourbon
like
quality
theres
a
solid
malt
contribution
but
to
me
its
overshadowed
by
the
oak
and
alcohol
and
a
mild
bitterness
after
having
had
a
few
heavily
oaked
ipas
im
not
so
sure
i
like
the
combination
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
low
in
carbonation
this
to
me
was
the
beers
best
quality
overall
this
one
didnt
work
for
me
the
oak
and
alcohol
were
just
too
apparent
doesnt
taste
quite
as
good
as
it
smells
the
malt
is
still
exceptionally
sweet
and
buttery
the
hops
are
still
big
and
wonderfully
varied
but
everything
doesnt
click
as
perfectly
as
they
do
in
the
aroma
still
very
good
though
first
off
the
art
on
the
lable
is
sick
i
love
that
style
of
tattoo
art
my
next
ink
session
will
be
in
that
style
i
saw
this
at
my
local
store
and
they
hadnt
even
got
the
price
on
the
bottles
so
i
assume
this
is
fresh
poured
into
my
pint
glass
the
beer
is
orange
amber
heavy
on
the
orange
the
head
is
enormous
its
a
thick
creamy
white
color
it
hasnt
receded
at
all
so
i
will
have
to
take
a
drink
to
talk
about
lacing
the
aroma
is
hoppy
but
sweet
fruit
shines
through
as
well
almost
bubblegum
like
the
flavor
is
hops
and
toasted
malt
it
has
a
strange
flavor
that
i
cant
seem
to
decipher
its
not
a
bad
flavor
but
i
just
have
never
had
an
english
ipa
before
so
it
may
be
the
style
of
hops
back
to
the
lacing
wow
thick
lace
completely
covers
my
glass
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
yet
different
beer
for
me
we
lie
on
our
backs
gazing
up
at
the
clouds
and
seeing
shapes
and
enjoy
d
high
for
such
a
big
beer
watch
out
i
actually
prefer
this
to
dreadnaught
but
not
one
of
the
top
ipas
ive
head
nice
golden
amber
scent
of
floral
goes
down
easy
with
a
caramellike
hint
and
a
pronounced
hoppy
bitterness
smooth
and
tasty
and
totally
representative
of
a
good
solid
ipa
not
a
groundbreaking
or
unique
brew
but
certainly
solid
and
enjoyable
appearance
is
excellent
a
clear
coppery
liquid
with
a
fine
2
finger
head
which
stays
around
for
a
bit
smells
caramelly
and
sweet
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
and
i
was
surprised
at
the
subtle
taste
of
the
hops
in
this
english
ipa
theyre
in
the
background
a
bit
bitter
but
not
overwhelming
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
almost
barleywineish
a
little
lighter
but
the
malt
taste
is
up
front
very
dry
the
beer
leaves
almost
zero
aftertaste
its
there
and
then
gone
i
would
say
drinkability
is
not
that
high
but
i
just
realized
this
beer
is
going
down
faster
than
i
thought
d
this
is
one
seriously
yummy
eipa
that
thankfully
doesnt
contain
the
signature
overabundance
of
amarillo
hops
or
any
for
that
matter
its
a
really
good
recipe
and
the
toasted
oak
aging
really
adds
a
nice
hit
of
extra
flavor
to
help
brace
against
the
9
abv
one
of
fffs
better
rare
offerings
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
i
know
they
used
all
english
hops
yeast
and
malts
but
to
me
it
was
a
cross
between
a
citrusy
american
ipa
and
a
spicyearthy
english
ipa
the
oak
added
a
unique
flavor
that
worked
next
time
i
would
let
the
bottle
sit
out
longer
before
cracking
interesting
enough
but
not
a
beer
id
care
to
get
again
given
the
hefty
price
tag
received
in
a
trade
for
some
hopslam
thanks
drew
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
had
a
nice
golden
body
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
of
hops
sugar
and
vanilla
full
bodied
creamy
and
syrupy
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
mostly
sweet
and
overly
oaky
with
an
almost
cloying
finish
that
has
very
little
hop
bitterness
i
appreciate
the
brewers
intent
with
the
oak
and
low
bitterness
to
make
this
taste
more
authentic
as
if
the
barrel
had
sailed
for
months
however
it
just
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
i
dont
think
ill
be
having
this
one
again
soon
this
is
the
third
time
ive
had
a
chance
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
this
beer
ive
needed
to
try
it
a
few
times
to
give
it
an
accurate
rating
because
of
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
found
in
this
tasty
english
ipa
the
first
time
i
tried
it
i
was
a
little
overwhelmed
by
the
flavors
i
was
experiencing
and
could
not
identify
them
one
of
the
unique
flavors
that
i
detect
in
this
beer
is
an
after
taste
of
english
toffee
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
creamy
its
not
too
carbonated
so
i
can
get
a
better
sense
of
the
various
flavors
as
with
many
three
floyds
this
is
a
great
beer
but
i
can
only
drink
one
or
two
glasses
before
i
get
overwhelmed
by
the
flavor
ordered
from
archer
liquors
hazy
burnt
orange
color
with
bright
white
centimeter
head
this
definitely
isnt
an
americanstyle
ipa
as
i
still
have
feeling
in
my
tongue
hops
are
more
floral
in
character
and
theres
a
crapload
of
malt
and
sugar
to
back
them
up
a
bit
buttery
you
can
definitely
taste
the
oak
in
this
one
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
a
little
syrupy
and
sticky
and
carbonation
is
medium
overall
i
like
this
a
lot
very
interesting
departure
typical
american
styles
drinkability
what
a
great
brew
its
essentially
an
english
dipa
a
fauxstyle
ive
never
had
occasion
or
the
opportunity
to
try
before
ill
be
damned
if
it
feels
or
seems
like
a
doubleimperial
anything
however
the
alcohol
on
this
one
though
formidable
on
paper
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
or
felt
as
many
have
mentioned
yes
the
bottle
artwork
is
grotesque
but
its
in
no
way
indicative
of
the
contents
whats
within
is
a
wellcrafted
unique
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brew
from
a
great
brewery
perhaps
a
little
tough
on
the
wallet
at
9
or
10
but
i
could
see
this
as
an
occasional
special
treat
or
paired
with
some
spicy
braised
meat
or
mexican
food
of
some
sort
color
me
impressed
overall
this
is
my
first
beer
ever
from
three
floyds
and
i
have
enjoyed
it
greatly
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
in
the
future
pours
a
very
nice
dark
copper
with
sweet
head
and
nice
lacing
huge
hop
scent
slightly
overwhelming
at
first
extremely
floral
with
a
vit
of
jerky
in
the
nose
huge
hop
flavor
too
like
a
tangerine
jerky
stick
very
hoppy
ek
golding
i
think
are
the
primary
needs
more
malt
to
it
but
wonderful
if
you
like
hop
bombs
goes
down
quite
smooth
for
a
9
brew
d
easy
to
finish
like
any
three
floyds
ipa
i
like
this
one
as
a
seasonal
that
way
i
know
i
can
get
it
when
its
fresh
and
i
wont
have
the
temptation
to
pay
12
for
a
bottle
of
this
that
often
overpriced
but
a
good
beer
none
the
less
the
most
enjoyable
barrel
aged
ipa
ive
had
i
started
off
strong
on
this
bomber
but
by
the
end
of
it
i
was
getting
a
little
sick
of
the
wood
taste
it
was
a
little
too
much
like
licking
furniture
overall
a
good
brew
though
if
samuel
smith
were
to
brew
a
dipa
they
could
do
worse
than
replicate
this
fff
effort
a
slightly
cloudy
coppery
pint
topped
by
a
thin
white
head
leads
to
a
fullbodied
brew
perfectly
balanced
by
a
substantial
hop
presence
in
the
back
of
the
throat
and
the
depths
of
the
nostrils
the
english
hops
lend
a
more
subdued
quality
to
this
style
than
the
left
coast
bigc
hops
typical
of
dipas
a
nice
dry
oak
flavor
backs
up
the
hops
like
entwistle
did
for
townsend
keeping
this
extreme
brew
tamed
and
the
taste
buds
clamoring
for
more
poured
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
1
finger
head
smelled
of
citrus
hops
oak
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
very
smooth
on
the
tongue
i
think
it
must
be
the
oak
i
find
most
oak
aged
beers
to
feel
this
way
hops
were
present
in
the
taste
but
i
think
the
oak
pretty
much
took
over
no
hint
of
9
alcohol
whatsoever
i
easily
put
the
bomber
down
at
dinner
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
would
have
preferred
more
hops
and
less
oak
taste
i
thought
it
was
good
but
as
the
beer
warmed
the
oak
was
too
prevalent
i
love
fff
beers
and
i
was
happy
to
try
this
dreadnaught
and
alpha
king
are
2
of
my
all
time
favorites
if
your
from
nw
indiana
or
southside
of
chicago
there
is
no
reason
not
to
pick
up
some
of
the
3
floyds
ipas
brilliant
d
22
oz
wasnt
quite
enough
for
me
i
could
probably
do
another
22
but
then
it
is
time
to
move
on
give
this
one
a
try
if
you
have
the
chance
overall
a
balanced
drinkable
english
ipa
fff
is
known
for
hopping
the
bejesus
out
of
their
beers
and
i
dont
complain
but
both
fresh
and
aged
this
beer
was
balanced
and
well
done
ill
take
more
from
bottle
into
tulip
glass
pours
a
clear
light
copper
with
two
fingers
of
head
that
slowly
fade
stubbornly
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
presents
mostly
malt
characteristics
warm
caramelcreme
brulee
with
a
pleasant
whiff
of
grapefruit
underneath
and
a
touch
of
oak
and
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
mediumbodied
with
enough
carbonation
to
keep
all
flavors
working
at
the
same
time
sweet
toffee
takes
the
lead
with
some
grapefruit
tartness
the
finish
is
a
wonderful
mix
of
bitter
hops
and
light
alcohol
rounded
out
by
the
subtle
oak
characteristics
of
smoke
and
vanilla
this
beer
truly
displays
balance
no
single
flavor
dominates
and
no
ibu
records
are
broken
instead
this
beer
provides
a
complex
balance
of
elements
that
seemlessly
meld
in
every
way
mouthfeelsmelltaste
if
at
all
possible
this
should
be
in
your
fridge
right
now
d
this
is
how
i
have
always
imagined
the
ipas
back
in
the
day
would
taste
after
making
the
long
sea
voyage
from
england
to
india
very
good
balance
of
flavors
with
the
oak
complimenting
the
hops
very
nicely
the
abv
stays
dangerously
well
hidden
a
most
outstanding
ale
that
i
will
seek
out
again
for
sure
i
think
three
floyds
needs
to
moderate
the
oak
presence
in
this
as
well
as
their
barrelaged
beers
if
anything
they
become
less
complex
harsher
and
less
drinkable
see
oa
dark
lord
and
oa
behemoth
so
much
of
the
depth
of
flavor
is
just
obliterated
i
know
the
floyds
are
all
about
extremes
but
perhaps
tasteful
restraint
is
becoming
the
new
counterculture
terrific
brew
looks
great
and
tastes
delicious
tpatuto
and
i
split
a
bottle
of
this
and
loved
it
it
poured
a
great
looking
straw
color
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
turned
into
a
light
haze
on
top
the
smell
was
the
only
lacking
part
of
this
beer
to
me
just
didnt
get
alot
out
of
it
taste
was
great
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
then
the
oak
took
over
sweet
vanilla
with
a
little
bite
like
a
whisky
went
down
smooth
and
was
really
easy
to
enjoy
would
buy
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
d
very
drinkable
very
enjoyable
good
balance
and
pleasant
throughout
this
years
version
is
even
better
than
last
years
i
strongly
recommend
picking
one
up
or
trading
for
one
if
you
are
on
the
fence
easily
the
best
from
this
style
ive
had
this
amazingly
smooth
ipa
will
have
me
begging
for
more
good
thing
im
drinking
by
myself
tonight
this
one
is
going
to
go
down
smooth
too
smooth
for
the
robust
9
didnt
realize
this
one
clocked
in
at
9
full
mouthfeel
with
not
much
indication
of
alcohol
pours
golden
with
foamy
white
head
significant
lace
retained
in
the
glass
the
hops
are
aromaticeast
kent
goldings
admiral
coconutty
taste
from
the
start
above
average
mouthfeel
though
it
burns
by
the
end
somewhat
drinkable
turn
away
the
label
and
drink
a
full
silky
mouthfeel
goes
down
much
easier
than
it
should
at
9
abv
a
keeper
and
find
more
of
this
from
a
fresh
ipa
perspective
this
is
not
at
its
hoppy
best
but
this
has
aged
pretty
gracefully
and
is
still
perfectly
inline
with
the
three
floyds
interpretation
of
a
double
ipa
big
malt
along
with
the
hop
focus
i
havent
had
too
many
chances
to
try
one
of
these
authentic
english
style
ipas
complete
with
oak
aging
and
a
higher
abv
so
this
was
a
welcome
chance
to
try
one
after
tasting
this
id
be
interested
in
seeking
out
some
more

thanks
to
mcallister
for
sharing
intersting
beer
d
very
drinkable
more
than
many
for
the
style
this
may
be
the
first
one
ive
had
that
said
abouit
being
an
english
ipa
on
the
bottle
it
was
a
very
good
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
a
big
bubble
rocky
two
inch
head
is
light
tan
in
color
and
leaves
a
bit
of
doted
lace
body
is
a
orange
amber
glass
like
body
nose
has
a
musky
sweet
hop
character
including
tones
of
citrus
peel
pine
paprika
and
resin
like
marmalade
enters
the
mouth
with
that
same
citrus
based
resiny
feel
with
first
sip
it
then
turns
to
a
mineral
based
piney
feel
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
that
hangs
on
the
the
buds
strong
a
mixture
of
musky
malt
dry
spices
and
orange
peel
make
up
an
odd
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
hampered
by
this
a
bit
for
me
feel
is
nice
and
smooth
and
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
at
9
i
am
not
sure
how
many
i
should
have
medium
sized
lacy
cream
colored
head
lightly
carbonated
bright
clear
orange
amber
color
smells
quite
juicy
fruity
with
some
toffee
and
cigar
tobacco
starts
quite
malty
sweet
but
with
a
good
hop
balance
alcohol
is
prominently
present
throughout
lasting
bitter
finish
with
a
sweet
sticky
toffee
finish
would
drink
again
if
i
could
get
it
d
overall
a
quality
offering
from
fff
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
well
balanced
it
is
tasty
and
would
definitely
consider
buying
some
more
the
english
ipa
style
also
seems
to
be
one
that
i
dont
find
often
enough
good
solid
beer
poured
a
22oz
bomber
into
my
brother
thelonious
goblet
this
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
orangey
red
with
a
big
2
inch
head
that
quickly
disappeared
and
leaving
surprisingly
no
lacing
i
imagine
this
bottle
is
a
little
old
but
you
wouldnt
expect
so
from
the
nose
its
a
full
frontal
attack
to
the
nose
its
straight
grassy
hops
with
a
little
spiciness
coming
from
some
noble
hops
and
really
raw
oak
wow
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
hoplaced
ethanol
up
front
its
big
hops
on
the
tail
its
straight
booze
you
would
think
that
this
beer
would
have
somewhat
of
a
malty
flavor
just
because
of
how
much
alcohol
is
in
it
but
nope
i
dont
taste
any
malty
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
for
how
big
this
beer
is
wow
with
as
hoppy
as
this
beer
is
with
a
bit
of
age
i
cant
imagine
how
it
was
really
fresh
there
is
an
alcohol
presence
not
unsurprising
for
abv
level
yet
very
drinkable
something
of
an
english
ipa
on
steroids
with
vanillaoak
notes
interesting
drinkability
is
good
nicely
balance
i
like
the
addition
of
the
oak
in
this
one
even
though
the
hops
have
a
bit
of
an
american
slant
the
oak
and
the
great
malty
base
seems
to
pull
it
back
towards
the
english
side
good
stuff
murky
orange
with
some
light
breaking
through
the

surface
of

long
spicy

with

with

maybe
im
spoiled
by
american

this
was
not
one
of
my
favorite
3fs
offerings
md
body
is
medium
a
bit
viscous
and
carbonation
is
low
drinkability
is
ok
for
an
english
ipa
i
expected
a
much
tamer
brew
but
what
i
got
was
a
nice
surprise
the
lack
of
balance
is
the
only
real
critic
i
can
make
overall
a
good
beer
d
what
can
i
say
i
love
fff
and
this
is
a
good
one
not
as
hoppy
as
the
other
fff
brews
as
its
an

chewy
hoppy
balanced
semi
dry
finish
d
tasty
and
my
favorite
from
the
style
i
would
drink
this
again
if
it
wasnt
so
hard
for
me
to
get
and
i
wasnt
such
a
big
fan
of
american
ipas
lately
a
tasty
treat
and
a
great
reminder
of
where
the
style
started
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
very
nice
representation
of
style
while
taking
that
style
to
the
next
level
which
isnt
often
done
with
an
eipa
and
even
less
often
done
well
this
is
a
very
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
whole
evening
overall
a
solid
brew
dreadnaught
is
still
my
favorite
fff
beer
still
have
to
try
dl
waiting
for
a
special
occasion
by
far
medium
body
with
creamy
carbonation
the
9
abv
is
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
smell
or
taste
great
job
with
that
i
could
drink
these
until
i
was
feeling
that
9
and
maybe
then
some
very
tasty
beer
good
job
3f
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
creamy
head
with
some
nice
thick
creamy
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
hoppy
with
some
malts
bourbonwhiskey
slight
oak
with
some
citrus
the
taste
is
very
nice
really
different
hoppy
with
some
malts
oaky
with
some
bourbonwhiskey
notes
sweet
with
some
citrus
medium
body
very
drinkable
like
i
said
this
is
a
different
english
ipa
also
never
had
a
english
ipa
at
9
abv
glad
to
have
a
chance
to
check
this
badboy
out
thanks
christian
d
this
big
has
nice
big
hops
with
some
interesting
qualities
to
them
and
a
sweetness
that
really
punch
up
the
hops
this
beer
is
so
big
it
needed
a
glass
of
water
to
go
with
it
no
its
not
really
thirst
quenching
but
very
tasty
very
good
beer
with
some
unique
characteristics
recommended
if
you
havent
tried
it
yet
a
deep
amber
color
with
hints
of
orange
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
a
two
inch
thick
head
cream
in
color
that
laces
slowly
down
the
glass
a
malty
fragrance
at
the
front
that
is
followed
by
a
pine
and
grassy
aroma
a
malty
front
that
lasts
for
some
time
then
a
grassy
and
earthy
bitterness
takes
over
and
lingers
on
the
palate
a
medium
feel
at
the
front
that
gradually
gains
weight
as
it
rolls
across
the
palate
this
beer
gets
more
complex
as
it
warms
up
excellent
to
sip
while
playing
cards
or
throwing
darts
it
does
have
a
more
hoppy
flavor
for
a
english
style
ipa
the
malty
heartiness
is
strong
enough
to
overcome
that
and
balance
it
out
drinkability
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
that
im
glad
i
picked
up
i
wasnt
going
to
spend
the
cash
on
another
fff
ipa
because
i
figured
it
would
be
similar
to
the
rest
after
reading
the
label
i
decided
it
was
worth
a
try
and
im
glad
i
did
it
was
a
vastly
different
brew
than
the
other
american
ipas
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
or
trade
for
it
thanks
again
joe
full
body
with
appropriate
carbonation
very
well
done
the
oak
adds
a
nice
character
to
this
pours
a
bright
translucent
orange
amber
with
a
healthy
2finger
head
and
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
coming
to
the
top
the
retention
is
good
and
leaves
solid
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
balance
of
citrus
hops
up
front
and
a
strong
caramel
malt
base
there
is
also
a
heavy
dose
of
earthy
hops
throughout
as
well
the
taste
mirrors
the
aroma
with
a
grapefruit
and
grassy
hop
kick
giving
way
to
the
caramel
malt
base
there
is
a
bit
of
spiciness
in
the
finish
as
well
as
some
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
leaves
the
mouth
sticky
with
the
earthy
hop
juice
the
drinkability
is
fantastic
on
this
one
and
i
dont
notice
the
alcohol
at
all
the
best
example
of
an
english
ipa
if
you
can
call
it
that
ive
tasted
to
date
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
medium
beige
head
aroma
is
medium
sweet
with
melon
light
biscuit
some
floral
and
earthy
flavor
is
floral
earthy
melon
and
biscuity
lightmedium
body
silky
texture
medium
bitter
finish
another
winner
from
one
of
the
midwests
best
dan
extremely
interesting
brew
this
is
an
english
ipa
in
name
only
like
the
type
of
hops
used
and
the
name
in
no
way
does
this
resemble
any
ipa
i
have
ever
had
in
or
from
england
not
that
i
care
this
is
another
example
of
the
genius
that
is
fff
d
not
overly
taxing
good
stuff
d
this
is
definitely
hoppier
than
i
was
anticipating
for
an
englishstyle
ipa
yet
it
still
maintained
an
extremely
nice
balance
between
hops
and
malts
it
also
has
a
very
unique
flavor
and
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
never
tasted
a
beer
quite
like
this
one
and
ive
had
a
lot
of
ipas
fff
is
turning
into
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
traders
note
thanks
to
binnyskyle
for
the
bottle
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
yellow
copperish
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
small
grapefruity
lemon
citrus
and
a
hint
of
black
pepper
in
the
taste
pepper
lemon
citrusy
hops
a
small
bite
and
medium
body
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
hoppy
peppery
aftertaste
nice
english
maltiness
and
nice
lemon
citrusy
hops
very
good
not
at
all
what
i
expected
a
much
bigger
beer
heading
in
barley
wine
direction
the
color
was
a
pleasant
russet
not
much
of
a
head
to
speak
of
the
smell
is
grassy
with
some
pine
notes
the
taste
kicks
that
up
a
notch
with
the
oak
tones
coming
through
as
well
as
some
apple
its
a
big
viscous
yet
oddly
quenching
mouthfull
with
the
alcohol
well
hidden
but
warming
after
a
few
sips
a
little
of
this
goes
a
long
way
all
in
all
a
very
nice
beer
but
not
one
id
come
back
to
very
often
dvery
good
considering
the
abv
this
is
a
wellbalanced
beer
for
3fs
and
is
very
consumable
in
fact
i
never
leave
my
beerfridge
without
a
bottle
of
this
at
all
times
this
beer
may
be
enjoyed
by
new
comers
as
well
as
the
experienced
beer
geek
this
could
possible
be
my
favorite
accessible
beers
at
this
time
what
a
bizzare
beer
pours
a
dark
orange
with
a
big
big
head
lots
and
lots
of
lace
smell
is
citrusy
and
funky
a
touch
of
breadiness
in
there
as
well
flavour
is
indescribable
but
i
will
try
its
like
pumpkin
pie
spices
mixed
with
cedar
wood
and
lemon
zest
i
think
bitterness
is
very
aggressive
there
is
also
a
kind
of
funky
twang
to
it
i
would
attribute
that
to
the
oak
but
who
knows
i
think
i
like
this
beer
i
just
found
it
really
off
the
wall
glad
i
tried
it
notes
take
dreadnaught
cut
back
on
bittering
and
aroma
hops
partially
substitute
flavor
hops
and
voila
blackheart
overall
a
good
brew
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
love
the
flavor
super
happy
to
have
given
this
a
try
and
i
bet
a
blend
of
this
or
a
blend
of
these
hops
with
an
alpha
king
would
be
out
of
this
world
delicious
just
a
thought
for
those
of
you
who
live
close
enough
to
the
source
to
easily
procure
bottles
d
all
around
not
bad
i
guess
this
was
my
first
english
ipa
and
i
like
i
will
continue
to
explore
this
style
pours
a
murky
orange
haze
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
two
finger
head
that
stays
for
sometime
before
falling
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
a
good
amount
of
webbing
is
left
behind
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
light
pink
grapefruit
with
a
pasty
malt
aroma
as
well
some
carboard
and
sweet
floral
scents
in
the
nose
too
overall
the
hops
are
in
check
especially
for
9
abv
spicy
flavors
up
front
followed
by
sweet
caramel
malts
and
woody
herbs
midway
a
touch
of
bitterness
emerges
with
a
touch
of
booze
aftertaste
has
a
hint
of
toasted
grains
with
a
bit
more
citrus
and
grit
medium
slick
body
with
a
soft
and
smooth
feel
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
on
the
strong
side
and
prickly
a
bit
on
the
strong
side
in
terms
of
abv
for
the
style
but
after
further
reading
i
guess
thats
how
the
original
english
ipas
were
brewed
a
truly
unique
spiced
up
ipa
i
just
cant
get
over
how
graphic
the
label
is
sweeet
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
medium
to
low
carbonation
drinkability
pretty
good
interesting
i
cant
ever
remember
tasting
an
ipa
like
this
guess
ive
never
had
an
historical
english
ipa
i
likey
gimme
more
d
certainly
not
a
session
beer
but
it
is
really
a
wonderfully
complex
construction
with
a
bitterness
that
dances
right
up
to
the
line
of
being
overpowering
without
losing
balance
try
it
this
beer
poured
a
dark
very
cxloudy
amber
always
a
good
sign
the
smell
is
limited
but
what
i
get
is
nutscitrus
i
was
suprised
by
the
taste
i
dont
think
i
have
ever
had
an
english
ipa
before
to
me
it
seemed
like
an
american
ipa
mixed
with
an
english
pale
ale
with
the
nut
flavors
the
mouth
feel
is
very
pleasant
it
is
nicely
carbonated
this
is
a
very
dinkable
beer
and
i
wish
i
had
my
wife
pick
up
more
than
2
of
these
for
me
another
fine
brew
by
fff
i
really
liked
this
brew
good
stuff
pours
a
light
hazey
yet
bright
copper
wih
some
cool
bubbling
and
no
lacing
only
a
small
film
of
bubbles
greets
you
after
the
pour
good
color
but
bad
head
and
lacing
for
an
ipa
the
aroma
is
a
straight
forward
orange
zest
some
chammomile
and
lots
of
bitter
smelling
bread
the
taste
is
very
sessionable
for
a
9
abv
mild
hops
for
an
american
english
ipa
but
a
great
malt
bill
hints
of
caramel
a
touch
of
cinnamon
and
unrecognizable
herbs
very
easy
feeling
palate
great
sessionablilty
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
was
actually
very
refreshing
for
such
a
beer
blackhearts
a
unique
english
ipa
frankly
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
i
prefer
the
american
variety
much
more
though
i
still
do
i
cant
help
but
feel
like
this
is
an
english
ipa
on
steroids
the
sheer
strength
of
it
sets
it
apart
from
the
masses
it
also
has
a
lot
more
character
than
its
colleagues
im
still
not
converted
into
a
huge
fan
but
this
is
a
good
beer
probably
very
good
given
the
style
recommended
i
was
handed
a
reddish
amber
ipa
supporting
a
pillowy
head
the
creamy
mellow
body
that
cresses
yet
covers
your
mouth
in
a
silk
the
aroma
was
mostly
pina
coloda
but
there
was
so
much
more
subtlety
form
the
cask
it
was
overwhelming
i
had
two
pints
but
still
cant
pin
it
down
what
i
do
know
is
i
need
more
cask
ale
real
ale
now
blackhearts
label
has
to
be
one
of
three
floyds
most
grotesque
in
a
good
way
this
is
delicious
beer
that
doesnt
quite
have
the
magnificent
mojo
that
most
of
their
lineup
has
im
having
a
fantastic
time
with
the
bomber
but
given
the
9
99
price
tag
id
rather
buy
sixers
of
alpha
king
or
gumballhead
pretty
solid
all
around
d
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
loved
the
interplay
between
the
sweet
malt
and
bitter
hops
they
need
to
make
this
year
round
light
gold
color
with
a
bounitful
head
of
foam
great
hop
nose
pure
3
floyds
minty
super
juicy
and
citrusy
also
a
little
herbaceous
as
well
flavor
has
a
ton
of
character
and
is
nearly
perfect
incredibly
well
balanced
super
hoppy
and
bitter
with
a
lot
of
juicy
citrus
character
a
lush
malt
character
of
caramel
and
sugared
fruits
and
then
on
top
of
all
that
it
has
well
intergrated
oak
hints
of
vanilla
and
toasted
wood
a
surprise
what
a
well
crafted
brew
i
really
thought
this
was
the
most
balanced
beer
ive
had
from
fffs
and
i
hope
they
keep
making
this
beer
it
was
really
a
treat
wow
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
this
year
need
more
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
gives
a
nice
bold
taste
with
plenty
of
carbonation
to
refresh
and
give
continued
revitalization
to
the
hops
the
beer
could
use
some
more
background
taste
besides
the
bitter
hops
but
a
wonderful
beer
overall
three
floyds
once
again
creates
another
great
beer
and
i
hope
they
brew
this
one
more
than
once
much
thanks
to
buckeyenation
drinkability
this
is
one
unusual
and
interesting
beer
the
dryness
helps
make
the
beer
refreshing
and
inviting
as
long
as
youre
a
hop
head
like
me
pours
a
hazed
copper
thin
white
head
forms
big
bubbles
some
decent
lacing
settles
to
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
smell
is
neat
signature
3f
grapefruit
but
with
oak
caramel
oranges
some
citrus
biscuity
malts
alcohol
pretty
unique
taste
is
very
oaky
grapefruit
oranges
caramel
bread
alcohol
lots
of
malt
and
lots
of
hops
tempered
by
wood
very
malty
in
the
finish
almost
balanced
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
very
smooth
warming
alcohol
but
pretty
cool
i
liked
d
good
the
ibus
are
hidden
and
though
it
is
an
english
style
it
is
still
way
yum
on
my
scale
i
enjoyed
it
search
it
out
i
think
you
will
as
well
ovr
very
nicely
done
good
balance
and
nice
citrus
hoppiness
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
fff
i
immediately
went
out
and
bought
some
more
highly
recommended
blackheart
is
a
damn
good
brew
it
seems
to
be
more
of
an
engishamerican
iipa
hybrid
than
one
that
uses
only
english
ingredients
but
that
is
just
fine
by
me
another
solid
one
from
3fs
im
glad
i
grabbed
two
bottles
d
im
definitely
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
it
was
quite
enjoyable
just
watch
out
for
the
high
abv
another
finely
crafted
brew
from
three
floyds
recommended
d
great
tasting
beer
and
intensly
drinkable
but
i
dont
know
how
well
it
fits
into
the
actual
style
of
an
english
ipa
still
though
i
would
not
hesitate
to
grab
another
one
of
these
especially
if
it
is
fresh
on
tap
drinkability
is
fantastic
i
loved
the
oak
the
abv
was
hidden
dangerously
too
well
highly
recommended
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
seemed
light
even
from
the
scent
i
didnt
expect
it
to
be
so
strong
i
love
the
lasting
hoppy
aftertaste
fresh
this
was
a
damn
good
beer
and
i
can
only
hope
it
will
be
good
with
a
little
age
recommended
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
in
color
very
well
balanced
with
the
various
hops
smell
is
somewhat
fruity
and
citrusy
this
is
very
well
made
it
is
so
easy
to
drink
and
so
enjoyable
that
i
would
think
this
would
be
a
highly
sessionable
beer
for
me
but
at
9
this
one
would
hurt
you
in
a
hurry
but
i
would
love
the
trip
well
done
fff
as
expected
for
a
british
style
ipa
the
aroma
and
taste
show
a
nice
hop
and
malt
balance
with
fresh
fruitiness
breadiness
and
even
some
sweetness
counterbalanced
by
waves
of
bitterness
medium
bodied
easy
to
drink
it
could
use
some
improvement
in
appearance
but
is
otherwise
a
solid
british
ipa
overall
this
is
my
favorite
fff
beer
to
date
i
loved
it
ahhh
what
a
good
brew
i
ordered
this
friday
night
before
dld
and
was
not
disappointed
it
came
in
a
pint
glass
that
was
filled
to
the
brim
with
a
deep
orange
ale
that
was
slightly
cloudy
the
smell
was
just
like
an
ipa
should
be
a
little
citrus
with
a
twist
of
pine
this
beer
tasted
wonderful
hops
at
first
with
the
sweet
warming
of
alcohol
going
down
the
throat
light
in
the
mouth
and
just
a
hint
of
aftertaste
make
this
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
ipas
i
have
ever
had
it
is
very
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
many
because
its
a
deceptive
9
enjoy
thick
with
bready
malts
cereal
grain
and
toffee
candy
some
earthy
hops
on
the
middle
that
leads
into
a
floral
bitterness
with
a
grassy
piney
finish
all
of
this
is
taken
in
check
with
a
vanilla
toasty
oaky
flavor
that
just
pulls
things
together
an
almost
marshmallow
flavor
with
a
star
fruit
and
lemon
zest
fruit
drinkability
certainly
different
from
all
other
english
ipas
ive
encountered
but
its
good
and
isnt
that
what
counts
really
im
not
sure
if
this
one
will
stick
around
so
you
might
want
to
visit
the
brewpub
while
you
have
the
chance
really
tasty
english
style
ipa
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
appears
a
medium
copper
color
with
head
that
fades
fast
mild
but
pleasant
hop
aroma
a
mix
of
citrus
and
pineearthy
taste
is
well
balanced
with
some
caramel
malt
flavor
to
balance
the
bitterness
medium
body
and
carbonation
o
excellent
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
traditional
ipa
and
this
one
nails
it
bought
in
nc
drank
in
new
hamburg
on
wish
i
didnt
have
to
rush
this
one
but
i
have
a
flight
today
and
limited
luggage
space
scott
the
feel
is
good
a
medium
body
holding
some
firmness
and
a
steady
carbonation
allowing
for
a
nice
flow
between
a
crisp
bite
and
congruous
smoothness
the
flagship
ipa
poured
a
nasty
unfiltered
amber
with
thick
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
lace
the
scent
and
taste
are
synonymous
with
most
english
ipa
i
am
pissed
that
this
beer
has
chunky
yeasty
balls
in
it
which
means
i
will
not
finish
it
the
taste
is
bitter
and
not
too
bad
from
what
i
have
tasted
would
like
to
try
this
off
the
tap
to
avoid
the
stuff
that
gives
the
craps
overall
this
is
a
straightforward
not
over
the
top
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
the
nose
seems
a
little
off
but
otherwise
i
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
a
good
ipa
that
could
be
sessionable
in
the
right
situations
real
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
the
taste
has
a
good
caramel
sweetness
to
start
and
then
the
bitterness
comes
on
and
lingers
really
well
balanced
the
aroma
is
mostly
floral
not
much
of
the
malt
gets
through
overall
a
pretty
good
english
ipa
o
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
just
a
touch
too
much
abv
and
bitterness
to
be
sessionable
but
paired
really
nicely
with
the
mediterranean
food
o
ok
but
it
tastes
faded
the
date
from
total
wine
says
121412
im
guessing
that
is
the
shelved
date
i
reviewed
this
beer
jan
23
so
it
shouldnt
be
that
faded
for
an
english
ipa
i
would
expect
more
balance
however
its
still
a
decent
ipa
probably
better
on
tap
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
light
carbonation
a
medium
body
and
a
slightly
bitter
malty
finish
thats
on
the
sweet
side
average
overall
so
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
i
like
hoppy
american
ipas
better
but
this
was
worthy
of
trying
while
in
nc
d
this
was
a
decent
english
ipa
the
scent
and
taste
were
fitting
for
the
style
but
not
really
my
preference
the
body
was
very
nice
but
the
finish
was
a
little
harsh
so
it
was
not
the
easiest
to
drink
nice
to
try
once
but
easily
forgettable
pretty
good
ipa
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
good
hop
character
without
being
too
bitter
works
for
me
better
than
just
a
hop
assault
on
top
of
that
thirst
quenching
and
almost
sessionable
o
a
fine
english
style
ipa
ran
across
this
at
margauxs
in
raleigh
north
carolina
its
a
clear
quiet
ambercopper
color
with
just
a
breath
of
some
little
white
bubbles
on
top
and
modest
lacing
the
nose
picks
up
a
nice
citrus
nutty
pine
the
flavor
follows
suit
but
adds
a
peppery
grass
thats
a
little
on
the
harsh
side
but
not
bad
carbonation
is
sharpish
very
fine
and
body
is
between
medium
and
light
drinks
easily
and
is
pretty
refreshing
with
a
tingly
feel
that
maintains
fair
constitution
the
citrus
bread
flavor
holds
on
through
the
finish
definitely
worth
a
try
as
a
satisfying
hop
refreshment
for
me
this
is
a
nice
local
north
carolina
ipa
that
meets
ipa
standards
and
is
worth
a
repeat
and
it
comes
in
a
can
this
is
a
decent
balanced
intriguing
beer
the
crispness
and
spiciness
work
well
together
to
add
an
extra
degree
of
drinkability
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
plenty
hoppy
enough
for
an
english
ipa
light
enough
to
accompany
dinner
without
overpowering
it
not
bad
at
all
i
throughly
am
enjoying
this
beer
at
the
moment
it
poured
a
a
nice
light
brown
color
like
most
other
ipas
nice
foamy
head
that
settled
after
about
a
minute
leaves
a
good
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
nice
smooth
taste
yet
still
has
the
bitterness
you
would
expect
from
an
ipa
all
in
all
a
farily
good
beer
now
here
weve
finally
got
a
decent
beer
from
these
guys
this
one
is
not
bad
i
know
that
some
may
say
its
not
fair
to
judge
this
beer
because
it
was
probably
pretty
good
leaving
the
brewery
carolina
packaged
this
beer
in
their
own
labeled
clear
growler
that
is
very
spoilprone
then
they
deserve
this
kind
of
review
beer
people
know
that
clear
glass
is
terrible
for
protecting
beer
and
thats
why
even
bmc
prefers
to
package
in
cans
or
at
least
brown
bottles
but
a
naive
consumer
might
think
that
a
growlerpackaged
beer
is
fancier
and
higherend
they
wouldve
spent
good
money
expecting
a
good
beer
to
only
be
disappointed
by
something
that
should
be
poured
out
i
think
this
is
awful
and
carolina
should
be
ashamed
of
putting
such
a
poor
product
on
shelves
the
retailer
total
wine
more
in
raleigh
shares
some
of
this
burden
of
shame
too
but
i
had
other
growler
beers
from
that
store
and
they
were
fine
this
was
definitely
carolinas
fault
and
i
hope
that
they
would
address
it
i
will
contact
the
company
shortly
with
that
said
however
the
body
was
decent
moderately
thin
but
decently
carbonated
i
still
cant
get
over
the
lack
of
hops
if
you
like
this
type
of
thing
it
would
drink
well
i
suppose
but
im
not
a
fan
with
the
bitterness
there
and
nothing
to
complement
it
im
glad
i
only
got
a
sample
or
it
would
be
a
tough
time
finishing
a
pint
of
this
d
a
decent
ipa
not
one
that
id
seek
out
on
a
regular
basis
but
as
a
vacation
refresher
it
works
d
very
drinkable
goes
down
smoothly
would
have
another
anyday
delicious
but
not
overly
impressive
compared
to
other
ipas
the
brew
drank
real
well
i
sessioned
the
growler
myself
through
out
the
course
of
a
night
i
enjoyed
every
drop
and
it
went
well
with
all
the
appetizers
available
if
i
was
at
the
brewery
i
would
gladly
do
the
same
drinkability
pretty
decent
ipa
if
you
are
looking
for
immense
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
this
beer
does
not
have
it
but
more
of
a
mellowed
hop
character
still
very
drinkable
yet
it
fascinates
me
primarily
for
the
simple
reason
that
ive
never
had
a
beer
which
so
reminded
me
in
taste
and
particularly
in
aroma
of
uppermiddle
grade
weed
i
got
the
second
growler
just
to
see
if
the
first
was
an
aberration
but
no
the
effect
is
like
sticking
your
nose
in
a
ziploc
bag
of
kind
i
recognize
that
this
would
be
polarizing
even
among
pale
ale
fans
yet
when
i
assign
the
adjective
dank
to
this
brew
its
intended
as
a
compliment
with
a
balanced
abv
youll
be
able
to
enjoy
this
beer
over
and
over
again
good
enough
for
me
to
get
a
growler
on
the
way
out
on
tap
this
beer
poured
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
1
finger
head
the
smell
was
not
overpowering
but
there
were
faint
aromas
of
citrus
hops
and
malt
the
hop
profile
is
not
overly
drying
and
i
found
myself
ordering
it
again
and
again
this
was
a
very
easy
to
drink
ipa
get
it
on
tap
if
you
can
find
it
an
overall
good
beer
not
quite
as
strong
as
i
exepected
more
like
an
apa
nice
honey
color
good
hops
smell
good
taste
nice
grapefruity
hops
slight
spice
malt
backbone
great
drinkability
a
really
good
session
beer
better
than
carolina
pale
ale
imo
drinkability
very
easy
and
smooth
and
goes
great
with
salty
snacks
it
truly
is
a
tale
of
two
halves
in
the
taste
with
heavy
malty
bready
notes
up
front
and
suddenly
the
hops
kick
in
out
of
nowhere
the
second
half
saves
this
ipa
spicy
piney
hops
with
a
citrus
finish
not
heavy
but
powerful
enough
and
more
split
than
balanced
mouthfeel
is
overly
thick
at
first
but
thins
out
nicely
this
is
an
easy
drinking
ipa
that
wont
please
true
hopheads
but
will
easily
quench
a
thirst
on
a
saturday
afternoon
flavor
picked
up
my
impression
a
bit
with
some
good
notes
of
zesty
citrus
hops
biscuity
malt
and
a
touch
of
tropical
fruit
mouthfeel
was
well
carbonated
nice
medium
thickness
to
the
body
and
left
behind
some
excellent
residual
bitterness
from
the
hops
all
in
all
a
decent
summer
beer
but
this
wont
become
a
brew
id
seek
out
on
a
regular
basis
soft
and
mediumbodied
with
nice
carbonation
good
drinkability
it
was
ok
but
not
up
to
the
standard
it
usually
sets
ill
have
to
rereview
this
next
time
i
get
over
to
chapel
hill
in
hopes
that
i
can
be
more
positive
overall
this
was
a
decent
and
simple
brew
but
it
doesnt
have
enough
depth
to
it
to
make
it
stand
out
drinkability
a
beer
that
decided
to
err
on
the
side
of
light
easy
drinkability
but
as
it
offers
almost
no
flavor
or
depth
of
character
i
dare
wonder
whats
the
point
bright
golden
amber
in
appearance
white
head
falls
quickly
to
some
sticky
lacing
light
fragrant
aromas
of
pine
green
leafgrass
and
malt
tastes
of
slightly
bitter
piney
hops
grapefruit
red
apple
and
some
grainy
malt
mouthfeel
is
lighter
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
drinkability
was
great
went
down
quick
very
sessionable
definitely
growler
worthy
if
you
get
the
chance
served
a
nice
pale
amber
with
a
thin
head
that
diminished
to
a
ring
and
left
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
very
weak
some
citrus
hops
but
not
strong
at
all
the
taste
was
quite
interesting
it
was
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
an
ipa
the
malts
overpowered
the
hops
but
the
hops
did
show
through
nicely
in
the
finish
to
its
credit
the
beer
did
get
hoppier
as
it
was
finished
the
beer
was
light
and
crisp
and
somewhat
easy
to
drink
if
it
only
overall
tasted
more
like
an
ipa
had
this
at
the
brewery
location
poured
by
the
staff
not
very
impressive
looking
sort
of
flat
looking
leaves
a
minimal
amount
of
lace
on
the
glass
is
a
brown
color
actually
looks
almost
identical
to
the
brown
ale
they
had
but
with
worse
carbonation
smells
very
earthy
grassy
it
tastes
pretty
good
though
has
a
nice
balance
between
the
hops
not
sure
of
the
mix
a
little
like
cascade
but
something
else
in
there
too
and
the
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
much
more
syrupy
than
i
had
expected
overall
though
it
is
a
tasty
beer
and
i
can
enjoy
drinking
it
not
a
particularly
complex
ipa
but
very
solid
and
enjoyable
poured
an
orangeyvarnish
color
without
any
head
nose
was
just
slightly
of
hops
flavor
had
a
nice
malt
base
going
on
hops
provided
some
citrus
rind
and
christmas
pine
but
there
is
just
a
slightly
unappealing
varnish
flavor
mouthfeel
had
a
nice
medium
feeling
body
to
the
beer
enjoyed
a
couple
pints
of
this
offering
pours
a
coppery
golden
color
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
smell
is
light
citric
hops
with
a
sweet
caramel
malt
background
taste
is
light
floral
and
citrus
with
an
oily
mouthfeel
it
ends
with
a
sweet
but
mild
caramel
malt
and
leaves
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
that
is
gone
quickly
a
highly
drinkable
ipa
that
is
not
quite
as
complex
or
hoppy
as
its
main
north
carolina
ipa
competitors
hoppy
hour
and
big
boss
but
a
good
attempy
none
the
less
and
i
definately
see
the
english
ipa
style
as
being
apropriate
its
been
a
few
months
since
i
had
a
real
cask
ale
so
i
ran
to
the
tent
yesterday
serving
it
up
this
poured
a
rich
copper
with
a
nice
creaminess
to
the
head
aromas
of
caramel
and
some
nuttiness
hops
were
not
as
prevelant
as
i
thought
but
it
was
appetizing
enough
taste
is
highly
hopped
but
it
didnt
knock
me
out
with
em
there
was
a
nutty
malt
presence
in
the
background
that
i
picked
up
keeping
it
from
going
over
the
edge
a
worthy
cask
ale
my
first
nc
on
the
engine
very
solid
and
well
made
big
thanks
to
loki
for
the
growler
drinkability
the
combination
of
the
sweetness
with
the
hops
makes
for
a
bitter
but
smooth
brew
notes
solid
session
ipa
this
is
definately
one
of
carolina
brewerys
most
popular
beers
they
dont
brew
a
pale
ale
instead
they
brew
a
midgrade
ipa
that
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
a
solid
ipa
big
thanks
to
aksmokedporter
for
bringing
a
growler
up
to
ohio

the
carolina

is
all
that

the

nothing
so
much
as
shows
itself
to
try
to
tame
the
hop
landslide
assaulting
your
palate
almost
to
the
point
of
being

finishes
very
bitter
with
a
splash
of
grapefruit
juice
squatting
on
the

to
remind
you
what
this
is
made
of
biting
mouthfeel
but
still
drinkable
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
crisp
and
hoppy
in
the
nose
this
beer
is
bright
and
bitter
with
a
nice
clean
finish
and
slight
floral
and
fruit
notes
in
between
solid
all
around
but
nothing
to
really
sing
about
still
i
liked
it
and
ill
have
it
again
very
hoppy
but
still
balanced
more
then
some
ipas
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
someone
who
isnt
a
hop
head
though
nothing
that
stands
out
decent
but
not
great

overall

quite

todays
beer
drinker
in
general
seeks
gusto
but
i
seek
refinement
the
depth
of
character
found
here
and
the
freshness
that
it
displays
are
impeccable
the
roundness
of
it
running
across
wide
swaths
of
malt
various
hops
and
a
solid
yeast
character
are
rarely
found
anymore
and
in
combination
with
its
spoton
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
raspy
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
its
an
exceptionally
drinkable
englishamerican
hybrid
ipa
brilliant
bmfr
overall
a
nice
take
on
an
eipa
with
an
american
twist
ill
definitely
revisit
this
one
again
theres
an
apricot
like
element
to
the
flavor
the
hop
is
like
black
pepper
on
the
tongue
and
is
strongest
in
the
swallow
good
body
with
an
elevated
carbonation
for
the
style
short
aftertaste
thick
beige
cap
really
sticky
and
thick
with
great
head
retention
the
beer
was
mostly
clear
orange
in
colour
aromas
of
oranges
and
grapefruits
mild
malt
and
sweetness
a
bit
of
sharp
citrus
rind
hoppy
backbone
with
mild
malt
sweetness
solid
bitterness
citrus
grapefruit
and
orange
again
grassyspicy
character
with
lingering
bitterness
medium
to
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
faint
warmth
drying
on
the
palate
a
straight
ahead
and
nicely
balanced
ipa
a
decent
if
unexceptional
beer
mildly
flavoured
and
relatively
unexciting
o
good
english
ipa
leads
a
little
more
american
but
very
drinkable
it
was
best
when
it
was
right
out
of
the
fridge
overall
good
ipa
i
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
an
interesting
brew
but
the
long
trail
unfiltered
is
superior
if
you
like
some
hop
bitterness
burn
in
the
back
but
more
mild
semifunky
malt
flavor
this
may
be
for
you
worth
checking
out
just
for
diversity
but
not
worth
giving
up
your
left
nut
for
to
be
fair
it
wasnt
weak
and
there
was
enough
alcohol
in
here
to
be
felt
well
before
i
finished
this
off
a
slight
mint
aftertaste
kept
things
clean
and
neat
but
this
needed
to
be
a
bit
more
edgy
and
groundbreaking
to
stand
out
what
resulted
was
an
ipa
that
was
easily
drinkable
and
easily
forgotten
which
is
not
how
i
remember
my
beers
from
the
green
mountain
state
magic
hat
notwithstanding
only
worth
a
go
if
youre
a
hophead
that
needs
a
fix
and
wants
a
relatively
light
take
on
this
style
o
this
ipa
is
not
one
that
i
would
get
again
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
eipa
to
drink
for
a
while
o
overall
an
slightly
above
average
experience
the
hop
level
is
moderate
though
the
complexity
lacks
a
bit
i
did
find
this
an
bit
uneventful
upfront
but
warmed
up
to
it
by
finish
with
some
increased
hop
awareness
coming
through
first
brew
from
shed
a
decent
american
english
hybrid
with
some
of
the
best
features
of
both
the
nose
is
heavy
citrus
hops
but
its
balanced
well
by
a
sturdy
dose
of
sweeter
caramel
colored
english
malt
thats
a
bit
sweet
the
beer
drinks
on
the
heavy
side
which
is
unfortunate
this
summer
season
the
malt
just
gives
a
lot
of
body
while
the
hops
dont
get
to
be
fully
bitter
as
a
result
this
is
a
heartier
ipa
a
mans
beer
in
some
sense
i
do
get
some
bitter
in
the
finish
centennial
or
cascade
style
with
that
oil
component
vermont
makes
some
of
the
best
india
pale
ales
on
the
planet
but
this
isnt
one
of
them
it
is
suited
better
for
fall
though
like
most
english
styles
i
think
but
maybe
thats
just
me
i
am
still
looking
forward
to
trying
the
mountain
ale
as
the
craftsmanship
of
this
beer
is
solid
and
perhaps
another
beer
might
be
a
better
platform
for
it
to
work
a
good
widely
available
and
affordable
sixer
though
and
im
sure
ill
be
drinking
this
again
while
i
am
back
east
overall
though
for
an
ipa
this
one
is
a
good
one
to
know
about
o
easy
to
drink
if
you
like
english
ipas
with
the
well
hidden
alcohol
subdued
hops
and
slightly
maltier
flavors
this
is
a
solid
but
not
particularly
remarkable
ipa
im
not
convinced
its
an
english
ipa
i
didnt
check
ba
while
reviewing
and
i
assumed
it
was
an
american
ipa
im
not
sure
how
this
biases
my
score
regardless
more
than
anything
else
im
amused
at
how
proud
this
beer
is
to
be
brewed
in
vermont
its
like
vermont
is
becoming
a
brand
i
guess
thats
kind
of
cool
the
label
also
read
unfiltered
so
i
went
with
a
mediumhanded
pour
not
aggro
but
not
gentle
either
this
resulted
in
at
least
two
fingers
of
dense
tawny
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
deep
amber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
redolent
with
grapefruitcitrus
hops
and
my
mouth
was
watering
as
a
result
mouthfeel
was
very
soft
allowing
the
citrus
hops
to
really
shine
finish
was
definitely
dry
but
not
so
dry
as
to
leave
me
gasping
for
air
i
did
an
agitation
for
my
second
pour
and
released
the
lees
as
a
result
i
guess
that
it
depends
on
what
you
like
personally
i
do
not
mind
the
lees
and
like
them
as
a
separatefinal
pour
no
problem
there
one
final
thought
i
am
unsure
that
this
is
an
eipa
it
tastes
more
like
and
aipa
pours
a
very
dark
garnety
color
kind
of
a
burntamber
head
was
fine
smell
is
of
malt
taste
is
of
malt
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
mouthfeel
was
fine
i
cant
quite
understand
how
this
can
be
called
an
ipa
its
a
darkcolored
malty
ale
with
very
little
hop
character
its
not
bad
per
se
its
just
not
what
youre
looking
for
if
you
ask
for
an
ipa
this
is
a
decent
average
ipa
with
noticable
citrus
tones
with
a
hint
of
earthiness
and
almost
a
soil
kind
of
thing
its
smooth
on
the
feel
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
more
of
a
mass
appeal
ipa
instead
of
something
bringing
some
punch
i
can
dig
it
though
overall
tasty
beer
suffered
a
bit
from
caked
yeast
in
the
bottle
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
sometime
as
this
has
some
potential
brewreport
blogspot
com
odnot
a
terrible
ipa
doesnt
wow
you
at
all
tasty
enough
a
solid
ipa
i
could
never
see
myself
seeking
it
out
but
wouldnt
kick
it
out
of
my
cooler
either
no
this
thing
needs
some
help
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
orangebrown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
hops
a
touch
of
citrus
taste
is
well
balanced
hops
and
malts
a
mild
bitterness
very
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
hop
bomb
this
aint
it
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
before
so
im
trying
to
take
into
account
those
times
as
well
as
this
weird
floaty
experience
i
think
its
a
good
allaround
ipa
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
if
anyone
knows
why
i
would
get
the
floaties
please
message
me
id
like
to
know
why
o
well
if
it
werent
for
the
floaties
and
the
mild
aroma
this
beer
would
certainly
have
scored
higher
since
i
liked
the
flavor
im
going
to
try
look
for
another
bottle
to
try
hoping
the
particles
and
light
aroma
were
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
o
meh
a
real
typical
traditional
ipa
the
killer
is
the
quick
dissipating
smell
that
was
already
weak
to
begin
with
it
almost
felt
like
an
overly
bitter
pale
ale
i
wont
be
going
back
for
any
more
of
these
unfiltered
caramel
color
which
looks
great
for
an
ipa
floral
and
citrus
aroma
the
aroma
continues
into
the
taste
the
floral
and
citrus
notes
from
the
aroma
really
shine
with
a
more
bitter
hop
centered
taste
the
classic
ipa
bitterness
coupled
with
the
grapefruit
citrus
sweetness
makes
for
a
really
refreshing
beer
for
the
summer
finishes
on
the
bitter
side
notes
very
drinkable
with
a
nice
dry
finish
cheers
the
taste
has
a
quick
burst
of
pale
malts
but
then
the
floral
hoppy
character
takes
command
and
leaves
a
moderate
bitterness
on
the
tail
end
people
who
love
their
hops
will
find
this
to
be
a
delight
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
medium
burnt
orange
color
with
numerous
slow
small
streams
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
nice
full
thick
head
that
clung
extremely
well
but
thinned
out
fairly
fast
aroma
was
a
floral
slightly
sweet
hoppy
smell
nothing
over
bearing
or
unpleasant
flavor
was
a
bit
thin
and
watery
a
piney
hoppy
finish
with
a
bit
of
kick
but
not
much
felt
good
in
the
mouth
coated
ok
with
a
a
tad
of
carbonation
overall
a
solid
ipa
but
nothing
spectacular
o
a
decent
ipa
that
sits
on
the
lower
end
of
middle
in
the
ipa
pack
pros
personally
enjoy
the
thicker
texture
and
is
generously
hopped
for
an
english
style
ipa
making
it
more
american
than
english
no
complaints
here
cons
grainy
and
low
alcohol
coming
through
the
aftertaste
is
what
i
would
consider
the
most
enjoyable
part
of
this
beer
because
the
malts
kill
the
hops
during
the
experience
but
afterwards
when
the
malt
is
gone
the
hop
residue
gets
to
shine
through
a
little
more
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
slightly
hazed
goldenrod
coloring
with
little
to
no
head
aromas
of
grapefruit
light
toffee
and
floral
hops
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
nose
flavors
of
roast
toffee
initially
immediately
followed
up
by
floral
and
bitter
hops
that
completely
take
over
the
palate
cedar
cut
grass
and
sap
all
blend
to
represent
the
hopping
in
this
brew
and
the
citrus
tones
shine
through
at
the
end
of
the
palate
to
add
some
tartness
to
the
bitter
aftertaste
the
malt
profile
literally
disappears
by
the
aftertaste
light
crisp
mouthfeel
with
a
bitter
slightly
drying
finish
solid
brew
with
flavors
stronger
than
the
looks
and
abv
would
lead
you
to
believe
overall
a
tasty
and
well
balanced
ale
with
a
fresh
hop
bite
more
yeast
and
malt
influence
than
a
lot
of
ipas
today
which
is
maybe
why
it
is
considered
an
english
take
on
ipa
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
golden
color
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
that
quickly
drops
to
a
cap
smells
of
citrus
and
earthy
hops
with
some
bread
and
caramel
maltiness
to
provide
balance
a
hint
of
mineral
water
and
a
touch
of
orange
and
lemon
round
out
the
nose
nicely
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
focused
on
the
malt
than
the
aroma
lead
me
to
believe
sweet
bread
cracker
and
caramel
malts
countered
with
earthy
and
citrus
hops
long
lingering
hop
bite
at
the
end
of
every
sip
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
bitter
slick
mouthfeel
im
pretty
impressed
with
this
bottled
version
its
been
years
since
i
enjoyed
any
of
the
beer
ive
had
at
the
brewpub
this
is
actually
a
pretty
good
gateway
ipa
overall
pretty
good
nothing
crazy
and
more
of
a
pale
ale
than
ipa
but
decent
profile
decent
malt
base
that
balances
but
stays
out
of
the
way
of
the
hops
the
bottle
conditioning
seems
to
have
taken
off
and
added
its
own
mild
profile
but
gives
the
beer
a
nice
robustness
drinkable
and
doesnt
offend
on
any
account
o
this
beer
definitely
tastes
like
an
english
ipa
and
has
subdued
flavors
of
hops
and
is
a
little
maltier
compared
to
american
ipas
any
traces
of
alcohol
are
well
hidden
from
the
taste
very
clean
and
crisp
english
style
ipa
good
bitterness
but
not
overwhelming
dry
biscuit
malt
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
butter
on
the
midpalate
piney
and
floral
bitterness
on
the
back
end
kicks
the
brew
up
a
little
bit
a
very
bold
but
drinkable
english
ipa
with
decent
balance
pretty
good
mildly
amusing
not
must
try
the
beer
pours
a
golden
amber
very
cloudy
the
smell
of
hops
is
less
than
anticipated
the
taske
is
hoppy
with
a
underwhelming
finish
there
is
something
missing
from
making
this
beer
decent
was
hoping
for
a
stronger
hoppy
hit
but
it
hits
you
and
quickly
goes
with
a
sharp
after
taste
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
sa
perfect
pint
pours
a
dull
tangerine
hue
with
a
slightly
hazy
clarity
and
a
dense
creamy
three
inch
creamcolored
head
this
beer
looks
great
in
the
glass
nose
expresses
citrus
rind
and
an
earthy
character
taste
follows
nose
however
there
is
a
pleasant
toasted
malt
character
citric
acid
is
interspersed
throughout
the
flavor
profile
and
finishes
with
a
slightly
earthy
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
in
body
but
closer
to
light
with
a
lively
almost
prickly
carbonation
acidity
lightly
stimulates
the
palate
and
sides
of
the
cheeks
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
english
ipa
looking
forward
to
trying
more
offerings
from
these
guys
id
love
to
see
this
oncask
o
not
a
bad
american
ipa
and
a
nice
little
boost
there
at
6
abv
which
goes
relatively
undetected
it
was
good
for
a
couple
but
the
palate
could
get
burned
out
on
its
mediocrity
or
yeasty
oxidized
offflavors
before
too
long
id
get
again
but
would
eagerly
accept
a
more
intriguing
tap
offering
very
smooth
and
full
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
pleasant
but
a
little
less
crisp
than
i
might
have
liked
for
the
style
not
bad
not
at
all
exceptional
felt
more
like
an
english
ipa
than
an
american
one
o
a
good
britishstyle
ipa
which
probably
was
not
as
fresh
as
it
could
be
thus
little
in
the
way
of
hop
bite
the
slight
sharp
tartness
is
assumed
to
be
from
age
a
lot
better
than
i
expected
smooth
and
rich
for
this
style
a
delightful
english
india
pale
without
the
over
hopping
of
an
american
ipa
o
i
get
the
feeling
this
bottles
probably
seen
some
shit
green
bottle
not
helping
things
but
still
its
pretty
rough
overall
neither
the
hops
nor
the
malt
give
the
impression
that
even
in
peak
condition
this
would
be
much
better
not
a
fan
of
this
one
o
drinks
more
like
a
double
ipa
albeit
without
the
american
hops
and
only
5
5
very
nice
im
yet
to
have
a
bad
one
from
this
brewery
its
like
a
lighter
version
of
yorkshire
stingo
i
think
some
of
the
other
reviewers
have
been
drinking
old
bottles
its
a
good
beer
very
drinkable
but
not
a
good
ipa
for
an
american
palate
fine
but
surprisingly
uninteresting
beer
from
this
topgrade
brewer
lacks
sharpness
and
intrigue
of
more
floralamerican
hops
tastes
like
standard
pub
draught
fare
overall
a
great
beer
my
opinion
of
this
beer
may
have
been
tainted
by
the
fact
that
i
was
looking
for
a
more
modern
american
ipa
and
this
wasnt
it
but
you
should
definitely
be
warned
that
this
is
pretty
far
from
what
most
people
think
of
when
they
think
of
an
ipa
not
an
awful
beer
necessarily
but
perhaps
a
little
misleading
nice
enough
but
have
had
better
i
like
a
good
malty
english
ipa
but
this
one
lacked
something
in
the
aroma
and
flavour
overall
a
beer
id
have
again
tasty
toasty
and
enjoyable
still
the
bitterness
could
be
more
pronounced
for
the
style
and
the
diacetyl
is
this
close
to
being
a
fault
it
lends
itself
to
the
beer
to
a
point
however
giving
off
a
cozy
buttered
toast
impression
this
is
certainly
an
unusual
one
its
different
than
any
english
ipa
ive
ever
had
in
fact
it
tastes
more
like
a
german
lager
to
me
its
enjoyable
but
i
wouldnt
give
it
to
someone
wanting
an
eipa
experience
however
there
is
no
question
that
the
most
wonderful
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
gorgeous
flaskshaped
bottle
that
contains
it
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
3
25
d
good
enough
and
hits
the
spot
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
english
rjt
i
see
the
potential
in
this
to
be
a
pleasant
solid
english
ipa
but
unfortunately
with
no
easy
way
for
me
to
guarantee
a
fresh
bottle
its
really
not
worth
the
risk
and
even
fresh
i
dont
know
that
it
would
be
really
anything
great
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
unknown
bottled
date
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
brownish
color
with
a
smaller
med
lived
head
which
leaves
a
lacing
there
is
a
little
green
bottle
skunk
rubbery
smell
lots
of
malt
little
hops
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
okay
you
have
the
skunk
funk
some
weird
bitterness
but
not
quality
hop
bitterness
followed
by
some
malts
overall
there
just
isnt
much
to
say
about
this
brew
its
not
bad
per
se
but
it
certainly
isnt
good
not
recommended
to
even
try
if
you
have
to
pay
for
it
i
think
if
you
try
it
once
youll
decide
that
is
enough
just
not
interesting
at
all
o
easy
drinking
british
style
session
ale
could
be
better
but
still
an
honest
one
overall
kind
of
a
plain
beer
with
not
much
to
recommend
it
its
not
bad
but
its
just
kind
of
boring
and
uninspired
o
nice
eipa
nothing
too
amazing
but
a
decent
session
beer
it
was
a
good
beer
but
not
one
im
in
a
hurry
to
get
again
big
flavours
and
enjoyment
give
it
a
whirl
onot
that
good
dont
like
the
hop
or
malt
flavor
to
this
one
green
bottle
from
a
local
shop
in
ann
arbor
pours
light
golden
with
big
fluffy
white
head
aroma
of
skunk
and
hay
no
hops
to
be
found
flavor
follows
with
pure
skunk
flavor
dry
finish
and
a
bit
of
hay
mouthfeel
is
light
this
is
honestly
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
had
medium
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
overall
i
bought
this
one
because
i
have
never
tried
it
before
and
the
bottle
was
quite
intriguing
but
i
will
pass
up
on
their
ipa
again
i
will
try
the
other
ones
i
saw
like
the
cream
stout
from
st
peters
brewery
in
hopes
that
i
like
them
more
the
beer
pours
a
deep
orange
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
not
much
lacing
the
aroma
is
english
hops
a
faint
floral
scent
biscuity
malt
and
a
bit
of
caramel
are
evident
as
well
taste
is
of
bready
malt
and
caramel
up
front
mildly
citrusy
hops
enter
midpalate
the
finish
is
semisweet
with
a
lingering
bitterness
quite
nice
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
medium
level
of
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
great
malt
backbone
and
tasty
hop
profile
make
it
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
id
have
this
again
d
this
was
very
hard
to
drink
until
it
warmed
up
substantially
i
am
a
big
fan
of
eipas
but
will
definitely
not
revisit
im
definitely
thinking
i
got
a
lightstruck
bottle
but
why
take
the
chance
definitely
picking
up
a
more
pronounced
hop
profile
on
this
bottle
the
first
time
i
had
it
i
thought
it
was
excellent
but
not
anything
like
the
west
coast
hop
bomb
ipa
style
that
ive
grown
accustomed
totho
it
did
make
me
imagine
that
this
was
what
a
britishstyle
perhaps
cask
conditioned
ipa
was
actually
like
now
im
thinking
the
first
bottle
i
had
was
just
plain
old
thankfully
not
skunked
this
is
still
great
but
now
with
hops
very
citrusy
refreshing
light
but
flavorful
hops
a
pretty
good
ipa
in
keeping
with
the
english
style
and
nicely
balanced
i
wish
it
had
more
aromatic
hops
to
round
out
the
bitterness
the
diacetyl
is
palatable
but
a
bit
of
a
flaw
worth
trying
but
i
reckon
there
are
better
examples
out
there
724
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
wouldnt
consider
it
to
be
sessionable
despite
the
low
alcohol
content
because
the
taste
doesnt
capture
my
interest
long
enough
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
well
well
well
this
beer
really
delivers
where
it
has
to
seriously
enjoyable
and
well
made
reinforcing
my
admiration
for
english
ales
especially
the
ipa
dark
amber
almost
copper
with
white
foamy

that
stays
around
subtle

thats
undeniably

slight

towards
the

with
some

this
transports
me
to
old
england
im
enjoying
the
trip
d
very
easy
to
drink
could
be
sessionable
since
it
wont
overwhelm
ones
palate
some
bitterness
in
the
tasting
otherwise
kind
of
maplelike
acidic
likely
past
its
prime
and
barely
even
drinkable
in
this
state
beware
of
aged

will
be
buying
again
and
again
very
nice
beer
d
very
nice
a
decent
english
ipa
could
drink
several
of
these
ontap
this
beer
is
a
lot
of
fun
its
tastes
extremely
fresh
and
balanced
considering
how
much
of
a
hops
presence
it
really
has
most
reviews
are
from
the
bottle
and
the
average
grade
is
spot
on
a
green
bottle
is
no
way
to
treat
a
beer
as
good
as
this
aroma
is
quite
strong
and
surprisingly
more
fruity
than
hoppy
having
apple
pear
and
a
hint
of
banana
it
pours
an
average
clear
dark
amber
with
a
fairly
thick
fluffy
offwhite
head
flavor
is
hoppy
somewhat
bitter
rather
fruity
and
just
a
bit
syrupy
quite
different
from
most
ipas
i
have
sampled
this
is
almost
like
a
blend
of
an
ipa
and
a
cider
it
has
a
yeasty
earthy
undertone
and
overall
is
rather
satisfying
texture
is
fairly
smooth
just
a
little
tingly
and
a
teeny
bit
slimy
d
this
is
a
much
appreciated
trip
in
a
glass
across
the
pond
for
me
into
the
history
book
of
ipa
and
what
it
may
have
tasted
like
back
in
the
day
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
night
the
balance
of
malt
to
hops
is
much
more
even
compared
to
american
ipa
counterparts
this
is
definitely
a
beer
on
my
list
of
i
wish
i
could
try
this
on
nitro
beers
i
drank
this
while
eating
homemade
curried
lentils
it
was
a
fantastic
pairing
notes
this
beer
is
slightly
below
average
its
not
horrible
then
again
its
just
not
where
it
should
be
d
sweet
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
nothing
special
will
not
purchase
this
again
have
enjoyed
st
peters
brews
but
not
this
one
good
moderately
high
carbonation
big
mouthfeel
light
carbonation
makes
it
feel
thicker
than
it
really
is
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
english
indian
pale
ale
mouth
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
carb
low
drinkability
is
high
for
a
mediocre
beverage
and
probably
the
strong
suit
what
a
nice
beer
this
is
seriously
it
is
delicious
an
excellent
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
both
kind
of
up
and
in
your
face
but
neither
dominating
so
much
as
to
make
it
either
sickly
or
like
sucking
lemons
there
is
a
noticeably
bitter
aftertaste
which
i
really
enjoyed
a
beautiful
beer
this
poured
a
very
tall
thick
and
foamy
head
there
was
also
a
lot
of
visible
bubbles
in
the
glass
clear
vibrant
light
amber
color
slightly
skunky
on
the
nose
then
aromas
of
citrus
and
some
faint
toasted
malt
tasted
of
caramel
toasted
malt
subtle
dry
hops
and
a
faint
and
unpleasant
bit
of
soapyness
that
did
not
linger
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
had
a
smooth
somewhat
light
mouthfeel
d
sweet
buttery
and
forgettable
more
bitter
and
rich
than
the
abv
lead
me
to
expect
drinkability
id
guess
this
ones
probably
not
too
high
in
abv
easy
to
drink
toasted
malt
dominates
the
aroma
and
maybe
the
faintest
hint
of
grassy
hops
there
was
a
hint
of
skunk
when
i
cracked
the
cap
but
i
dont
smell
it
in
the
glass
light
amber
colored
beer
is
still
and
the
short
white
head
doesnt
last
very
long
malt
dominated
flavor
is
a
mix
of
biscuit
malt
and
caramel
finishes
quite
bitter
low
carbonation
and
moderately
full
body
make
for
an
easy
drinking
beer
a
flavorful
malty
beer
but
the
hops
are
no
where
to
be
seen
overall
a
very
good
job
here
a
bold
and
bitter
english
ipa
showcasing
the
english
version
of
this
style
well
if
it
wasnt
for
the
subpar
looks
this
one
would
have
gotten
a
much
better
overall
score
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
one
ill
have
again
as
for
st

i
find
it
a

really
does

what
we
might
have
seen
in

the

an
excellent
a
i
sincerely
regret
not
picking
up
a
bottle
of
harviestouns
bitter
twisted
years
ago
when
i
first
had
the
chance
it
is
extraordinarily
flavourful
for
a
beer
of
such
low
abv
but
not
to
the
extent
that
i
would
be
worried
about
tiring
out
my
palate
with
multiple
servings
this
is
a
remarkably
sessionable
eipabitter
that
i
would
not
hesitate
to
recommend
to
any
fan
of
pale
ales
english
or
american
perfectly
suited
for
the
warm
months
although
it
would
probably
be
a
treat
any
time
of
year
give
this
one
a
shot
you
wont
regret
it
crystal
clear
pale
gold
color
with
tons
of
bubbles
running
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
pint
glass
head
pours
cream
colored
but
fades
almost
immediately
smells
extremely
earthy
and
bready
with
a
very
faint
hop
presence
and
a
not
too
subtle
sweetness
although
i
love
the
taste
of
this
beer
the
hop
is
noticeable
but
not
anywhere
near
what
im
used
to
in
american
ipas
present
but
not
over
powering
the
yeastybiscuit
notes
are
wonderful
and
theres
a
slight
sweetness
that
has
to
be
malt
derived
it
finishes
extremely
clean
and
has
almost
zero
aftertaste
i
could
definitely
see
myself
drinking
more
of
this
throughout
the
summer
months
because
of
the
4
2
abv
and
easy
drinkability
along
with
the
great
taste
really
glad
i
finally
decided
to
pick
this
beer
up
for
a
try
bomber
poured
into
a
pint
glass
golden
honey
colored
and
a
wisp
of
a
head
some
nice
initial
lemon
zest
lavender
orange
blossom
aromas
very
pleasing
and
delicate
the
initial
taste
is
not
too
bitter
actually
more
tartsour
than
bitter
but
that
said
not
overly
so
and
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
some
mineral
flavors
balance
out
the
floral
qualities
and
its
a
bit
heavier
than
i
had
expected
with
a
consistency
that
comes
close
to
a
cream
ale
the
dry
hopped
taste
stays
with
you
very
drinkable
above
average
and
a
good
price
on
the
sale
table

overall
it
is
rather
refreshing
and
has
quite
a
complex
taste
for
such
a
light
bodied
brew
a
good
one
to
try
i
dont
reckon
this
is
too
bad
a
decent
sipper
that
im
in
no
hurry
to
get
again
any

i
quite

it

another

there

seem
to
promise
quite
a

however
the

5tried
this
from
a
cask
at
tap
table
in
emmaus
pa
the
first
time
i
was
there
i
wouldnt
have
said
that
this
beer
was
an
ipa
when
i
first
had
it
i
thought
it
was
along
the
lines
of
an
english
bitter
with
the
twist
of
lemon
added
to
it
after
seeing
that
its
an
ipa
i
suppose
the
citrus
quality
it
has
isnt
such
a
drastic
jump
from
one
stlye
to
another
for
the
beer
the
color
was
a
light
copper
with
a
nice
smooth
looking
head
that
left
lacing
down
the
glass
the
beer
was
ultra
smooth
going
down
im
not
sure
if
i
really
liked
the
flavor
of
this
so
much
the
lemon
was
a
little
overwhelming
for
me
personally
this
beer
would
be
ideal
for
summer
time
drinking

also
quite

refreshing
not
sure
if
its

beer
awards
worlds

worthy
as
it
claims
on

it
is
pretty

really
unique

grassy

earthiness
with
a
nice

reminds

of
orval
wonderfully
unique
complex
taste
that
features
the
rye
from
the
nose
along
with
a
toasty
bitterness
balanced
with
a
touch
of
lemon
sweetness
very
crisp
and
dry
and
totally
drinkable
planning
another
trip
to
scotland
just
to
get
some
more
of
this
great
beer
drinkabiltys
good
since
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
with
some
balance
and
plenty
of
character
and
the
abv
is
low
this
is
a
superbly
drinkable
beer
and
quite
a
good
thirst
quencher
very
sessionable
at
a
modest
4
2abv
to
boot
i
definitely
recommend
this
fine
flavourful
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
smooth
to
start
with
some
light
courseness
in
the
finish
d
an
easily
sessionable
brew
that
isnt
packed
full
of
flavor
but
is
still
easily
enjoyable
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
welldone
maybe
not
the
worlds
best
but
a
nicely
bitter
and
drinkable
englishstyle
esbipa
hybrid
the
peppery
character
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
but
a
nice
one
at
that
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
yeah
its
alright
a
tidy
little
bitter
that
doesnt
offer
a
hell
of
a
lot
on
the
nose
but
delivers
a
crisp
medium
carbonated
fresh
mouthfeel
with
some
of
those
zesty
lemon
notes
as
promised
some
of
the
malt
base
youd
expect
from
a
uk
beer
surprised
how
summery
it
is
i
might
come
back
to
this
when
it
gets
a
little
hotter
poured
cold
into
a
tall
glass
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
one
is
a
slightly
hazy
iced
tea
color
with
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
with
some
white
floaties
and
a
goodly
creamy
offwhite
head
the
lacing
is
substantial
as
well
the
aroma
is
malty
herbal
hops
sort
of
a
bitter
rye
quality
the
flavor
follows
with
all
the
same
qualities
a
fair
citrus
hop
with
some
of
that
herbal
overtone
maybe
even
a
bit
heavy
floral
theres
a
toasted
rye
bread
sense
over
smooth
mellow
lemon
thin
to
mid
bodied
and
decently
drinkable
refreshing
while
interesting
to
the
palate
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
and
will
happily
revisit
nice
stuff
i
would
like
to
try
this
fresh
in
a
cask
form
considering
how
its
already
pretty
good
from
the
bottle
after
being
imported
a
solid
bitter
recommended
really
solid
appearance
and
really
full
complex
nose
flavor
also
offers
some
complexity
relative
to
this
style
other
flavors
offer
a
nice
offset
to
the
hops
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
notes
a
really
tasty
beer
the
lemon
note
is
pronounced
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
especially
if
it
were
on
draft
fairly
light
body
with
low
carbonation
very
smooth
the
long
finish
makes
you
feel
as
thought
its
coated
your
mouth
very
sessionable
at
4
2abv
and
tastes
good
enough
that
youd
actually
want
to
session
with
it
this
ones
a
winner
d
as
drinkable
as
they
get
nice
all
round
beer
with
every
reason
to
try
drink
and
repeat
great
session
this
was
way
more
bitter
than
i
expected
the
taste
of
lemon
mixes
perfectly
with
the
hops
and
makes
for
an
refreshing
drink
interesting
a
highly
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
with
a
unique
lemon
twist
i
really
enjoy
this
one
d
very
drinkable
provided
its
only
4
2
abv
this
is
a
perfect
alternative
to
stronger
ipas
d
this
was
a
great
beer
not
going
to
be
top
of
its
class
as
far
as
an
ipa
but
very
drinkable
great
session
beer
overall
not
an
extraordinary
beer
but
a
good
beer
for
the
summer
very
thirst
quenching
poured
into
a
mug
as
a
slightly
hazzy
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
bubbly
white
head
smell
is
floral
and
citrusy
low
carbonation
and
light
feel
but
leaves
the
mouth
dry
taste
is
somewhat
sour
like
a
grapefruit
sourishness
and
you
are
able
to
taste
some
leafy
hops
decently
drinkable
despite
the
odd
sourishness
at
the
start
overall
another
nice
brew
from
harviestoun
it
started
off
rough
with
the
appearance
but
gradually
got
better
from
the
nose
to
the
finish
i
found
everything
subdued
in
both
the
smell
and
the
taste
but
this
served
to
increase
its
balance
crispness
and
drinkability
next
time
i
see
this
i
would
definately
buy
another
a
good
example
of
the
low
end
or
nonextreme
ipa
poured
with
a
murky
gold
appearance
with
a
full
thin
lacing
on
the
side
and
minimal
retention
floral
citrus
lemon
flavors
were
apparent
in
the
aromas
along
with
a
leafy
hop
smell
taste
is
a
little
thin
but
maintains
a
slightly
sourish
flavoring
mixed
with
bready
malt
again
a
bit
thin
but
refreshingly
light
overall
not
too
bad
drinkability
not
recommended
a
bit
like
lemon
pledge
finishing
off
the
pint
was
a
long
grueling
task
a
tad
accrid
bitter
to
be
sessioned
but
deffinately
something
ill
have
in
the
frisge
on
a
hot
summer
day
drinkability
its
definitely
refreshing
im
afraid
that
for
the
price
and
availability
in
my
area
its
a
little
prohibitive
to
have
too
often
nonetheless
an
enjoyable
and
very
nice
pint
overall
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
ipa
that
definitely
leans
toward
hop
dominance
the
malt
profile
is
light
and
the
hops
add
good
flavor
aroma
and
bitterness
low
carbonated
mouthfeel
making
it
pretty
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
best
light
alcohol
beers
ive
had
a
highly
sessionable
ale
needless
to
say
one
doesnt
notice
the
4
2
abv
but
does
notice
the
bitter
and
twisted
character
from
the
hops
note
that
this
is
perhaps
more
of
a
hoppy
pale
ale
than
an
ipa
but
what
the
hell
it
is
a
hop
forward
session
ale
from
the
other
side
of
the
pond
recommended
and
something
i
would
enjoy
during
summer
if
only
i
could
get
my
hands
on
a
fresh
supply
medium
bodied
not
as
thick
as
an
american
ipa
with
a
pretty
low
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
does
a
lot
for
the
refreshing
quality
of
the
beer
drinkability
very
tastey
hop
beer
from
scotland
very
aromatic
and
easy
to
drink
low
alcohol
makes
it
great
season
beer
and
one
that
does
not
come
up
short
in
the
least
in
flavor
and
complexity
long
finish
give
it
a
try
worth
shot
thin
creamy
white
head
that
evaporates
swiftly
minimal
lacing
pale
golden
color
with
a
fine
gauzy
haze
to
it
much
brighter
yellow

very

pit
fruit
overall
has
a
big
initial
punch
then
trails
off
after
that
mediumbodied
with
full
bubbly
carbonation
fills
the
mouth
through
the
attack
with
grain
wheat
green

bitters
its
lean
but
stops
short
of
turning
biting
moderate
kick
in
the

the
apricot
peach
nectarine
fruit
livelier
and
sweeter
here
almost
teases
out
some
malty
cocoa
notes
once
the
foaminess
subsides
its
very
smooth
and
creamy
good
unforced
length
there
is
definitely
that
sweetness
on
the
palate
only
here
its
not
a
pleasant
character
that
backs
up
the
hops
but
rather
a
stickiness
that
lingers
throughout
the
palate
taking
away
precious
tastetime
from
those
other
beer
flavours
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
back
palate
but
not
as
much
as
i
would
expect
from
something
with
bitter
in
its
name
front
palate
is
a
bit
dusty
and
then
that
slight
sweetness
kicks
in
which
actually
just
has
the
effect
of
toning
down
the
flavour
a
bit
this
isnt
a
very
fatflavoured
beer
or
phatflavoured
beer
for
that
matter
theres
a
simplicity
that
makes
it
not
so
drinkable
although
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
fuller
than
the
flavour
and
quite
nice
actually
nothing
particularly
nasty
in
it
just
a
whole
lot
of
meh
at
the
risk
of
raising
a
few
scottish
nationalist
hackles
its
really
typically
english
aley
tasting
this
after
old
engine
oil
im
quite
disappointed
i
must
say
drinkability
this
is
nice
an
ale
that
drinks
like
a
lager
even
at
cellar
temperature
so
much
debris
left
in
my
glass
d
a
flavoursome
refreshing
pale
ale
interesting
enough
for
a
session
and
easy
enough
and
refreshing
to
drink
that
you
dont
have
to
think
too
much
about
enjoying
it
noticeable
differences
from
bottle
to
bottle
ranging
from
lemony
to
woody
is
there
some
bottle
conditioning
here
balanced
and
very
drinkable
good
hops
fix
in
the
uk
somewhat
yellowyorange
in
the
glass
this
develops
a
decent
brightwhite
head
containing
loose
bubbles
before
fizzing
away
leaving
behind
a
small
amount
of
lace
theres
a
bitter
aroma
that
has
some
citrus
and
a
sharp
lagerlike
twang
to
the
smell
that
was
rather
unexpected
the
taste
however
is
nothing
short
of
wonderful
moderately
sharp
hops
all
around
with
a
pointed
flavor
of
grapefruit
and
lemon
falling
mercifully
short
of
the
brutally
overhopped
pale
ales
that
seem
to
be
everywhere
these
days
nicely
understated
and
beats
the
pants
off
of
just
about
any
ale
of
this
type
ive
ever
had
american
or
british
light
carbonation
and
low
alcohol
make
this
superbly
drinkable
and
theres
plenty
of
complexity
to
warrant
several
return
trips
put
simply
youd
be
hard
pushed
to
find
a
bottled
beer
more
full
of
character
the
polaropposite
of
bland
commercial
lager
the
beer
itself
is
quite
light
bodied
very
refreshing
and
only
modestly
carbonated
the
lemony
spritz
which
the
bottle
dubs
as
zesty
says
it
all
the
beer
has
a
lemony
slightly
grapefruity
and
maybe
a
bit
of
orange
burst
as
its
most
pronounced
characteristic
there
is
a
very
nice
bittering
english
hop
right
underneath
the
zest
and
just
a
tad
bit
of
cracked
grain
huskiness
lingering
around
the
edges
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
very
drinkable
english
pale
ale
that
is
definitely
nouvelleish
and
not
traditional
in
its
interpretation
at
all
worth
seeking
out
nice
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
english
style
bittering
hop
aftertaste
lchaim
this
is
the
story
of
a
little
beer
that
lost
its
way
after
being
bottled
the
brew
master
promised
it
would
go
to
a
good
home
however
life
would
not
work
out
so
well
for
this
crisp
golden
beer
with
a
very
thin
covering
i
say
its
a
good
thing
it
leaves
a
quickly
dissolving
lacing
and
film
on
the
glass
to
add
extra
protection
without
much
carbonation
that
protection
seems
to
wear
out
quickly
and
leaves
it
vulnerable
to
the
likes
of
me
a
beer
lovingdrinking
enthusiast
i
was
first
attracted
to
this
beer
by
its
very
floral
hoppy
and
citrusy
scents
loured
me
into
pouring
it
into
a
glass
and
to
try
some
unfortunately
this
is
where
the
story
gets
ugly
at
first
sip
it
was
intriguing
with
its
combination
of
sour
lemons
and
hoppy
vibrance
but
the
bitterness
that
is
left
when
it
leaves
is
a
bad
note
to
go
out
on
so
be
it
to
say
that
this
beer
didnt
find
a
good
home
for
i
didnt
really
enjoy
it
because
of
the
real
bitterness
finish
makes
this
hard
to
drink
even
with
its
delectable
scent
and
light
bodied
smoothness
in
your
mouth
the
aroma
is
full
of
grapefruit
my
favorite
the
taste
is
great
like
grapefruit
juice
but
no
extreme
pithe
bitterness
hop
bitterness
does
linger
but
not
for
long
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
for
me
grapefruit
light
beer
no
extreme
pithe
bitterness
loved
this
beer
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
very
well
made
a
fine
brew
definitely
worth
an
imbibe
this
beer
seems
meant
to
be
guzzled
every
gulp
makes
you
want
another
and
the
slight
hoppiness
leaves
the
hallertau
flavor
in
your
mouth
long
after
each
swallow
id
stroll
to
a
pub
and
have
many
a
pint
of
this
cheers
at
the
end
of
the
palate
its
quite
watery
which
is
a
shame
but
its
a
very
drinkable
brew
of
course
this
beer
is
just
another
example
to
draw
a
firm
line
between
the
english
ipas
and
their
american
cousins
distant
cousins
still
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
and
it
turns
out
surprisingly
clean
and
refreshing
this
brew
has
great
drinkability
and
very
sesionable
i
had
a
few
tonight
with
dinner
and
it
was
very
enjoyable
experience
finishes
on
a
cloyingpiney
note
hmm
but
overall
a
good
beer
just
needs
a
new
name
this
may
be
a
case
of
the
north
american
palate
not
being
fond
of
our
brethrens
style
across
the
pond
but
i
do
believe
that
other
english
ipas
like
samuel
smiths
are
rounder
and
richer
than
those
in
the
states
i
tried
this
beer
on
december
24
2007
after
purchasing
from
my
local
lcbo
outlet
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
orangygold
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
was
hoppy
with
some
citrus
and
spicy
tines
in
the
mix
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
with
mild
carbonation
the
flavour
is
hoppy
with
some
grapefruit
and
lime
flavours
mixed
in
with
the
spices
500ml
bottle
purchased
from
lcbo
several
months
ago
when
this
was
a
seasonal
release
though
i
never
got
around
to
reviewing
it
until
now
but
it
has
a
best
before
date
in
january
09
pours
a
pale
gold
with
just
a
hint
of
haze
nice
but
reserved
hoppy
aroma
flavour
is
nice
a
bit
thin
in
the
middle
but
with
some
warming
english
hop
aftertaste
d
decent
drinkability
but
a
tad
bland
and
gets
boring
fast
was
expecting
more
from
this
and
name
is
misleading
take
it
or
leave
it
drinkability
quaffable
quite
high
in
alcohol
for
an
englishstyle
ale
but
all
the
better
definitely
could
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
several
of
if
youre
looking
for
a
milder
version
of
an
ipa
drinkability
is
slightly
above
average
on
this
english
ipa
but
i
do
prefer
most
united
states
ipas
to
this
particular
brew
the
first
glimpse
is
a
medium
ambe
with
a
little
sunshine
yellw
glimmering
through
amidts
the
this
coloring
are
suspended
bits
of
sediment
the
aroma
is
a
light
bready
malt
some
mild
hops
citrus
and
a
touch
of
mint
the
first
sip
is
a
very
mild
malt
bill
definetly
toasted
with
a
bit
of
caramel
malts
then
some
muted
hops
maybe
minty
but
definetly
piney
the
palate
is
a
strong
astringent
mix
of
malt
and
hops
ery
resiny
palate
not
a
bad
beer
to
be
your
first
right
after
work
wile
you
wait
for
your
bar
pizza
to
cook
i
am
pretty
sure
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
this
beer
i
would
buy
it
again
but
it
is
certainly
a
little
cost
prohibitive
overall
a
very
nice
beer
i
would
be
a
great
one
to
have
on
tap
at
you
local
pub
as
it
has
a
nice
rounded
flavor
yet
low
on
alcohol
too
bad
i
will
probably
never
have
it
again
poured
a
golden
straw
like
color
with
a
huge
amount
of
carbonation
it
had
a
very
hoppy
scent
along
with
a
citruslemony
aroma
excellent
taste
a
great
malthop
mix
that
starts
very
sweet
lager
like
and
ends
up
with
a
great
hoppy
pale
ale
finish
with
a
great
bitter
aftertaste
along
with
slight
citruslemony
flavor
it
is
an
extremely
smooth
beer
it
goes
down
great
the
taste
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
it
was
not
bitter
or
twisted
it
was
a
little
watered
down
with
a
slight
hint
of
spice
their
was
a
little
hoppy
aftertaste
but
nothing
to
good
flavour
is
harsher
than
expected
with
a
lot
of
bitter
citrusy
hops
surprisingly
sweet
backbone
smooth
but
lightish
mouthfeel
unexpectedly
refreshing
for
the
style
would
make
a
much
better
summer
patio
beer
bottle
from
the
lcbo
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
small
head
which
quickly
diminishes
to
a
fine
film
aroma
of
lemony
hops
and
freshness
if
you
can
call
that
an
aroma
tastes
bitter
but
in
a
pleasant
refreshing
way
also
a
nice
lemon
kick
crisp
light
palate
enjoyable
stuff
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
approachable
beer
with
the
low
abv
could
definitely
use
for
session
drinking
d
a
pretty
accessible
hoppy
ale
not
terribly
exciting
but
a
nice
refreshing
brew
the
spices
are
more
evident
on
the
palate
also
has
some
lemon
doughy
bread
and
a
bit
grassy
i
should
have
bought
more
than
four
these
guys
can
make
a
flavorful
ale
pours
a
very
clear
medium
gold
a
touch
lighter
than
the
average
ipa
or
bitter
and
with
a
very
substantial
pure
white
head
that
builds
quickly
and
dissipates
slowly
leaving
a
ton
of
lacing
smell
is
sharp
citrus
and
evergreen
nice
and
spicy
with
obviously
english
character
taste
is
a
bit
unusual
lemon
for
sure
and
a
hint
of
pine
crackerdry
breadiness
and
a
touch
of
marijuana
for
good
measure
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
thin
feels
a
bit
watery
but
drinkability
is
excellent
at
4
2
i
could
comfortably
session
this
all
night
and
id
certainly
enjoy
the
opportunity
to
do
so
its
a
nice
beer
not
stellar
but
very
pleasant
d
its
not
really
to
my
taste
but
its
could
certainly
be
sessionable
bottle
poured
a
blonde
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
limited
retention
aroma
of
subtle
floral
malt
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
floral
malt
with
some
sweet
notes
body
is
average
with
some
average
carbonation
i
was
expecting
something
more
complex
or
bitter
based
on
the
name
of
beer
but
i
really
thought
this
was
bland
o
attractive
drink
in
its
own
right
but
not
a
session
beer
the
perfumy
hop
notes
preclude
drinking
too
many
real
session
beer
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
this
one

a
slightly
chill

all

and
very
refreshing
update
on
may
23
2009
i
tried
the
newer
version
of
this
beer
blond
beer
now
appearing
on
the
label
i
scored
the
newer
version
a
grade
lower
for
smell
and
taste
i
also
considered
that
the
malts
heavily
outweighed
the
hops
although
the
label
makes
reference
to
barley
oats
and
wheat
as
ingredients
with
no
mention
of
malt
at
all
finally
the
label
also
refers
to
a
superb
hop
profile
that
includes
hallertau
hersbrucker
challenger
and
styrian
goldings
to
give
it
a
sharpness
like
the
twist
of
a
lemon
i
can
certify
as
to
the
lemon
taste
but
the
hops
themselves
seemed
to
take
a
back
seat
to
the
malt
from
what
i
could
tell
go
figure
still
an
acceptable
brew
but
nothing
i
would
rush
out
to
buy
more
of
damn
a
really
pleasant
surprise
this
one
has
no
head
but
it
smells
like
pot
a
floral
hoppy
beauty
the
first
gullop
lives
up
to
the
promise
of
its
bouquet
yes
more
i
like
it
i
will
definitely
buy
this
one
again
its
been
a
long
long
while
since
i
had
such
a
definitely
great
new
beer
experience
i
love
pale
ales
and
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
but
the
bottle
states
blond
beer
uhm
why
well
who
cares
its
whats
in
the
bottle
that
counts
or
rather
its
what
was
in
the
bottle
and
is
now
in
me
gullet
that
counts
a
wonderful
example
of
an
english
ipa
something
i
would
likely
seek
out
in
the
future
very
fresh
smell
hops
come
through
as
citrus
fruit
aroma
actually
doesnt
tell
the
whole
story
there
is
some
nice
bitterness
that
comes
through
right
from
the
start
grassy
or
piney
and
a
real
tongue
coater
bitterness
lasts
throughout
as
the
biscuity
malt
and
fresh
lemon
come
through
in
the
end
mouthfeel
is
good
maybe
a
little
thin
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
respectable
uk
ale
that
i
would
watch
for
next
time
i
was
in
edinburgh
or
whatever
good
and
a
little
more
bitter
than
many
other
scottish
ales
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
i
paid
5
for
a
20
ounce
bottle
which
was
ridiculous
maybe
its
always
this
expensive
or
maybe
it
was
the
store
where
i
bought
it
its
better
than
average
for
the
style
but
since
i
can
get
a
6
pack
of
rogues
dead
guy
for
9
i
wont
buy
this
again
several
weeks
later
and
bitterness
is
odd
and
british
but
overall
nice
at
this
abv
dthis
is
one
damned
fine
sessionable
brew
mostly
mild
but
with
a
good
underlying
bitterness
throughout
an
excellent
refreshing
session
strength
ale
i
like
the
bt
a
lot
its
a
nice
example
of
the
english
ipa
but
fans
of
big
american
ipas
should
know
that
this
does
not
fit
that
mold
its
lighter
mellower
and
much
more
designed
to
be
a
pubican
session
beer
drinkability
again
this
is
best
served
cold
not
really
an
ipa
in
my
view
a
nice
english
ipa
still
think
it
could
be
a
little
more
robust
in
texture
overall
a
satisfactory
brew
was
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
will
definitely
enjoy
this
one
again
md
lightbodied
slightly
spritzy
unlike
the
softer
mouthfeel
as
in
the
past
allegedly
it
was
packaged
with
13
less
co2
than
most
bottled
beers
overall
although
this
is
still
a
mild
and
easydrinking
bitter
not
an
ipa
to
me
btw
its
less
tasty
and
less
hoppy
than
what
i
can
remember
from
my
last
bottle
two
years
ago
come
to
think
of
it
i
might
have
to
revisit
the
cask
version
again
sooner
rather
than
later
to
see
if
that
has
altered
slightly
as
well
this
is
trying
to
be
that
little
bit
different
from
the
normal
beers
brewed
in
scotland
and
isnt
unpleasant
it
is
just
not
really
for
me
the
scores
are
my
honest
results
i
would
have
loved
to
give
it
higher
marks
for
each
cat
but
it
isnt
a
great
beer
in
my
eyes
pours
a
nice
crisp
light
orange
with
a
decent
lasting
head
the
aroma
is
of
english
malt
and
light
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
a
very
interesting
balance
of
sweet
biscuity
malts
and
light
citrus
hops
the
beer
is
certainly
light
and
crisp
this
one
is
certainly
different
from
the
american
brews
i
lean
toward
but
provides
an
interesting
departure
for
a
temporary
change
of
pace
cheers
beertracker
d
okay
i
am
going
to
pass
in
the
future
among
the
most
reasonable
tasting
scottish
beers
i
have
had
to
date
golden
color
thin
head
clung
to
the
glass
all
the
way
down
very
mild
saltine
cracker
flavor
with
floral
earthy
notes
a
little
hop
bitterness
on
the
front
and
back
light
to
medium
bodied
and
superduper
drinkability
very
enjoyable
session
beer
or
a
just
getting
started
beer
to
get
the
malt
pacifier
in
while
contemplating
the
next
bolder
step
i
really
liked
it
had
a
pint
last
night
off
draft
appearance
is
golden
with
white
head
that
doesnt
seem
to
last
very
long
at
all
aroma
is
of
lemon
or
maybe
more
of
freshly
bruised
lemongrass
lemoncitrus
note
carries
over
into
the
flavor
some
malt
sweetness
to
balance
subdued
hop
bitterness
as
well
seems
perhaps
a
bit
thin
but
pleasant
in
its
own
way
tame
at
just
over
4
this
should
make
a
good
session
beer
light
crisp
pleasantly
quaffable
i
think
you
could
drink
several
of
these
and
enjoy
it
not
sure
i
would
call
this
an
ipa
seemed
more
akin
to
the
big
bottle
youngs
that
id
consider
more
of
a
regular
bitter
nothing
that
sets
it
apart
from
any
number
of
other
beers
but
just
a
solid
session
beer
cheers
looks
pretty
golden
with
a
slight
lacy
head
good
retention
smells
citrusy
grapefruit
and
lemon
also
a
bready
yeast
to
the
nose
tastes
nice
and
bitter
without
being
overpowering
citrus
and
herbal
hops
a
sweet
malt
very
pleasant
for
my
palate
light
carbonation
and
thin
malt
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
for
those
searching
for
a
big
body
or
overwhelming
taste
a
nice
break
from
the
american
ipas
which
can
be
a
bit
much
for
a
quiet
evening
had
this
brew
on
tap
last
evening
and
it
had
a
nice
golden
color
cloudy
in
appearance
with
a
nice
white
head
that
had
good
legs
leaving
nice
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
inviting
great
smelling
brew
with
some
different
scents
than
i
normally
see
from
an
ipa
the
scent
has
more
of
a
strong
floral
scent
rather
than
a
pine
or
american
grapefruit
citrus
smell
the
citrus
smell
that
comes
across
is
more
like
lemon
zest
also
with
a
grass
like
scent
very
inviting
with
the
hops
mixed
in
with
toasted
malts
the
taste
is
very
nice
this
is
a
smooth
beer
with
a
hops
noticeable
up
front
but
they
are
not
over
the
top
as
citrus
lemon
is
more
evident
with
a
sweet
and
roasted
malt
flavor
over
all
this
is
a
well
put
together
beer
glad
to
have
tried
it
on
tap
and
will
have
to
look
for
it
bottled
in
the
near
future
great
session
brew
with
the
lower
abv
bottom
line
a
very
tasty
ale
and
at
4
2abv
it
is
a
great
session
beer
good
stuff
bitter
and
twisted
is
a
play
on
the
scottish
psyche
i
like
the
sense
of
humour
i
wanted
to
like
this
better
but
there
are
a
few
pale
ales
id
put
in
front
of
it
probably
a
lot
better
on
cask
500ml
brown
bottle
from
florians
translucent
amberyellow
body
with
a
good
inch
of
white
head
smells
fruity
with
just
a
hint
of
skunk
citrus
dominates
the
flavor
with
undertones
of
skunk
light
bodied
somewhat
drinkable
but
the
skunk
hurts
the
aroma
flavor
and
drinkability
an
okay
british
ipa
but
would
be
much
better
if
it
were
not
skunked
ive
got
to
stop
buying
british
ipas
in
the
states
other
comments
it
definitely
deserves
the
acclaim
it
has
received
a
british
isles
blonde
that
stands
out
from
the
usual
boring
ones
very
easily
drinkable
a
nice
session
ipa
though
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
drinkability
a
true
session
beer
nothing
to
here
to
wear
out
the
palate
goes
down
very
clean
with
a
nice
bitterness
in
the
end
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
the
way
for
but
i
wouldnt
dismiss
it
either
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
transparent
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
head
that
degenerates
to
nothing
almost
no
lace
and
slow
carbonation
you
could
mistake
this
for
cream
ale
or
relatively
fullbodied
macro
fresh
aroma
grass
and
a
blend
of
english
german
and
american
hops
with
grapefruit
and
dusty
orange
notes
dominant
relatively
hefty
body
with
very
spare
carbonation
overly
syrupy
and
still
for
a
beer
of
this
weight
grapefruit
orange
and
strawberry
hop
flavors
in
the
mouth
some
bracing
dryness
in
the
finish
makes
the
next
sip
slightly
more
desirable
not
a
particularly
winning
combination
drinkability
an
interesting
and
refreshing
brew
i
really
liked
the
way
they
used
the
hops
this
one
would
go
great
with
fresh
seafood
flavor
is
subtle
as
well
lightly
citric
lemony
with
a
rind
dryness
melding
with
some
grain
in
the
finish
light
to
medium
body
with
muted
carbonation
making
this
smooth
despite
its
lightness
rather
quenching
this
may
have
been
the
end
of
the
keg
but
this
is
an
excellent
session
ipa
medium
mouth
that
has
plenty
of
carb
and
is
very
drying
very
drinkable
full
of
flavor
but
with
a
very
sessionable
abv
overall
a
pretty
good
and
very
drinkable
pale
ale
worth
a
try
d
highly
drinkable
i
could
quite
happily
sit
down
to
several
of
these
recommended
overall
a
very
enjoyable
and
hoppier
than
usual
eipa
a
very
nice
session
beer
that
would
fit
in
nicely
with
some
american
ipas
overall
a
beer
that
tastes
much
better
than
its
initial
presentation
not
as
big
as
an
american
ipa
but
an
easy
drink
i
enjoyed
i
picked
this
up
from
bubbles
on
n
oak
in
gladstone
for
under
4
1
pt
bottle
with
a
champion
bottled
ale
of
2004
from
the
brewing
industry
international
awards
logo
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
minor
head
about
a
14
inch
thick
however
the
lacing
is
good
clear
golden
color
and
vary
little
carbonation
smell
is
a
pleasant
grassy
hops
with
a
little
bit
of
biscuity
malt
but
not
very
powerful
taste
improves
upon
the
smell
grassy
and
floral
with
a
bit
of
citrus
in
the
back
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
borders
on
watery
but
i
will
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
leaves
a
sour
and
slightly
metalic
aftertaste
this
is
good
and
i
will
pick
this
up
again
from
time
to
time
boy
you
can
smell
the
hops
not
overpowering
but
definitely
there
this
brew
starts
off
tea
like
but
ends
with
a
pleasant
fruity
floral
hop
signature
nice
low
alcohol
and
mild
mouthfeel
make
this
an
all
around
good
session
brew
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
nice
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
wonderful
hop
aroma
its
dry
with
some
yeast
fruitiness
the
taste
is
decent
also
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
weak
and
quite
bitter
the
malt
content
is
low
while
the
hops
ring
true
from
start
to
finish
it
does
have
a
citrus
hop
aftertaste
which
emulates
a
lemony
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
brew
although
its
not
my
favorate
ipa
its
got
pretty
good
aroma
and
taste
the
focus
here
is
simplicity
with
the
grain
bill
and
attention
to
the
hop
character
overall
a
good
drinker
ive
had
this
a
couple
of
times
now
and
it
shaping
up
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
english
scottish
beers
i
guess
i
could
put
it
this
way
its
got
american
amounts
of
what
i
like
in
an
english
beer
if
that
makes
sense
im
assuming
this
came
out
of
a
bottle
since
thats
how
it
was
listed
but
i
was
never
brought
the
bottle
appearance
is
average
straw
color
not
a
whole
lot
of
head
appealing
hop
aroma
with
some
fruitiness
not
as
much
bitterness
as
i
expected
but
a
strong
fresh
hops
flavor
little
bittering
hops
lots
of
dry
hopping
i
guess
its
an
english
ipa
not
an
american
so
it
suits
the
style
in
the
aftertaste
a
little
grassiness
comes
up
might
have
spent
a
tad
too
long
on
the
dry
hops
maybe
i
liked
this
one
so
did
the
girlfriend
r
this
one
pours
a
very
clear
and
light
amber
color
with
a
very
small
head
that
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
hints
of
caramel
and
something
a
little
strange
but
that
could
be
a
yeast
byproduct
with
some
mellow
hops
almost
reminds
me
of
a
tea
smell
the
flavor
is
very
soft
and
subtle
there
are
some
british
hops
in
there
as
well
as
a
little
caramel
and
a
hint
of
spice
interesting
to
say
the
least
the
low
carbonation
gives
it
the
feel
of
a
hand
pump
beer
the
body
is
very
light
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
tried
this
on
on
tap
nothing
overly
exciting
or
remarkable
about
the
head
or
lacing
pouring
a
blonde
color
the
nose
hinted
at
peaches
and
pepper
i
found
this
to
be
a
little
thin
but
highly
carbonated
i
nice
slightly
peppery
and
spiciness
hits
you
was
there
supposed
to
be
a
bitter
something
there
if
so
i
couldnt
find
it
the
smell
was
the
best
part
totally
drinkable
theres
nothing
about
it
that
stands
out
had
this
on
tap
served
in
a
pint
glass
its
a
light
hazy
golden
orange
a
thin
head
some
light
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
an
earthy
slightly
doughy
malt
overlaid
with
a
fairly
strong
grassy
note
taste
is
a
sweet
slightly
buttery
malt
a
fairly
strong
spicey
hoppiness
a
slightly
citric
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
fairly
low
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
smooth
easy
drinker
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
esb
hoppier
than
most
but
still
a
balanced
good
session
beer
the
beer
itself
is
a
nice
balanced
gold
with
a
fine
head
and
fragrant
hallertau
hop
aroma
supposedly
this
contains
cascade
hops
but
i
thought
the
hallertau
dominated
the
flavor
of
bitter
and
twisted
is
exceptionally
wellbalanced
with
both
sweet
and
bitter
flavors
present
albeit
without
an
acrid
hoppiness
this
beer
is
exceptionally
drinkable
with
a
nice
medium
body
thats
neither
to
thin
and
watery
nor
too
syrupy
pours
a
fourfingered
cream
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
clear
amber
color
nose
is
hoppy
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
starts
hoppy
but
is
not
overbearing
finish
is
clean
with
not
much
bitter

and
a

ot
the

nice
as
well
i
imagine
this
would
rock
on
cask
in
the
homeland
drinkability
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
one
that
you
could
easily
session
i
am
not
sure
if
it
is
good
for
the
label
to
picture
a
mouse
rolling
around
with
their
hops
but
if
i
dont
get
the
plague
i
guess
it
is
ok
thanks
to
luckysevens82
for
the
sample
definitely
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
spicy
dry
and
lacking
the
sweetness
that
i
was
anticipating
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
but
the
awful
smell
really
brought
it
down
great
session
bitter
one
of
my
favorites
from
scotland
pours
straw
yellow
with
about
12
inch
of
creamy
head
aroma
is
hoppy
citrusy
taste
floral
hops
lemon
peel
mineral
like

finish
very
dry
mouthfeel
leaves
very
little
aftertaste
smooth
going
down
fairly
complex
for
a
bitter
a
very
nice
beer
drinkable
due
to
its
light
nature
not
bitter
enough
to
me
almost
reminds
me
of
snapple
in
some
way
anyway
not
worth
going
out
of
the
way
for
the
body
was
medium
and
the
carbonation
was
soft
leading
to
an
extra
drinkable
brew
if
i
were
in
scotland
id
definitely
seek
this
one
out
on
draft
or
on
cask
what
a
session
ale
looks
clear
and
clean
with
a
small
head
out
of
a
thick
500ml
bottle
nice
citrous
and
apple
aroma
initial
taste
is
like
apple
and
grapefruit
just
like
the
nose
goes
down
very
smooth
with
a
clean
aftertaste
hops
are
subtle
clean
and
tasty
nothing
in
this
beer
is
overpowering

for
a

great
example
of
a
british
session

beer
is

clear
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
this
is
an
awesome
example
of
a
small
beer
only
4
abv
with
a
punch
of
big
hoppy
flavor
not
too
subtle
like
most
other
british
imports
this
is
almost
like
an
american
ipa
toned
down
a
bit
if
you
like
hops
this
is
a
nicely
crafted
bitter
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
thin
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
especially
at
the
cost
taste
is
pretty
thin
not
much
biscuity
or
buttery
notes
one
would
expect
for
this
style
i
think
i
taste
some
tealike
notes
as
well
that
may
be
lemonlike
flavors
maybe
thats
from
the
hops
nothing
offensive
but
this
doesnt
have
much
going
on
which
reduces
its
overall
drinkability
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
with
quite
a
bit
of
character
i
was
seriously
wishing
i
had
more
than
one
bottle
pours
a
clear
apricot
hued
body
with
a
small
bone
white
head
that
quickly
falls
to
a
lasting
collar
extensive
sheets
of
lace
drape
the
dimpled
pint
glass
aroma
is
a
bit
subdued
with
spicy
and
floral
hops
atop
a
sweetish
honey
malt
background
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
light
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
taste
has
bitter
floral
and
spicy
hopping
with
some
pleasant
fruity
notes
of
pears
and
rome
apples
hops
are
assertive
but
nicely
balanced
by
crisp
and
biscuity
malt
sweetness
finish
and
aftertaste
are
bitter
with
floral
hops
and
a
hint
of
peppery
spice
very
well
constructed
and
nicely
drinkable
very
good
example
of
an
english
bitter
sweet
spicy
plenty
of
lemony
hop
flavour
dries
out
nicely
easy
carbonation
light
bodied
kind
of
a
summer
beer
in
my
book
all
in
all
bitter
twisted
is
a
close
to
classic
english
although
brewed
in
scotland
esb
friendly
drinkable
and
the
very
definition
of
sessionable
its
a
beer
that
most
everyone
should
enjoy
a
very
drinkable
beer
most
refreshing
after
all
the
malty
beers
dark
golden
color
with
a
creamy
head
almost
has
a
eurolager
aroma
the
taste
is
bitter
but
with
a
bit
of
malt
to
support
it
however
the
flavor
profile
is
not
pleasing
to
my
palate
its
also
a
bit
thin
and
astringent
on
the
tongue
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
offering
as
its
a
less
than
enjoyable
brew
the
beer
looks
decent
a
tad
darker
than
a
budweiser
with
a
nice
white
head
and
lacing
nice
aroma
of
skunky
english
style
hops
that
remind
me
of
a
warm
cup
of
tea
this
is
one
unique
brew
imagine
a
mega
ipa
but
with
sammy
smith
style
hops
starts
off
tea
like
then
ends
on
a
fruity
floral
hop
note
are
you
sure
this
is
from
the
uk
what
a
great
change
up
this
starts
up
front
like
a
sammy
smith
pale
ale
and
finishes
like
a
gumballhead
brilliant
at
only
4
2
i
wish
they
sent
this
over
in
12
packs
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
but
the
taste
makes
up
for
it
the
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
drawn
from
the
hand
pump
bitter
and
twisted
is
a
fairly
light
golden
honey
color
the
bubbles
rise
and
form
a
thick
dense
head
about
34
inch
the
aroma
is
surprising
dominated
by
citrusy
grapefruit
rinds
theres
also
an
ever
so
slight
damp
hay
note
flavor
is
sharply
hoppy
another
surprise
rounded
out
by
lightly
toasted
grains
akin
to
saltines
a
light
sweetness
fills
the
middle
followed
by
a
lingering
bitter
finish
living
up
to
its
name
also
abundant
is
crisp
hop
flavor
and
aroma
leading
me
to
believe
the
cask
must
be
dry
hopped
body
is
light
carbonation
on
the
money
this
is
quite
a
flavorful
little
drinker
i
was
a
bit
suprised
to
find
these
features
in
a
beer
from
scotland
overall
a
very
refreshing
beer
ideal
for
a
hot
day
medium
body
low
carbonation
overall
aiming
for
that
cask
impression
but
the
bubbles
still
bite
pours
a
nice
golden
hue
with
a
touch
of
light
orange
and
a
small
white
head
that
vanishes
almost
immediately
very
little
carbonation
light
sweet
aroma
of
toasted
malt
and
aromatic
hops
nice
palate
of
sweet
malt
up
front
developing
into
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
towards
the
back
of
the
mouth
wonderful
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
about
the
ideal
session
beer
if
it
werent
for
the
price
a
very
nice
ale
pale
golden
with
not
much
head
bit
of
white
head
that
reduced
down
and
stayed
at
a
slight
cover
and
ring
great
scent
of
dark
cherry
very
dry
mouthfeel
nice
hoppy
but
not
intense
no
fuit
in
the
flavor
must
be
that
you
think
you
should
taste
it
since
you
smell
it
thin
mouthfeel
low
carbination
decent
flavors
but
not
much
jumps
out
very
balanced
and
easy
drinking
chill
hazed
darker
gold
appearance
nice
very
white
head
that
lasts
well
and
rises
to
12
an
inch
complex
and
fairly
complete
lacing
aroma
hops
on
the
smell
lightly
citrusy
but
with
more
of
a
floral
sense
that
melds
well
with
biscuity
maltiness
nice
body
submedium
smooth
and
creamy
malt
and
hop
balance
very
well
early
a
combination
of
classic
hop
style
and
a
nice
sense
of
butter
and
syrup
on
flapjacks
both
the
sweetness
and
the
hop
contribute
to
the
finish
and
aftertaste
very
nice
tightly
balanced
and
drinkable
brew
here
one
of
those
beers
that
straddles
styles
has
a
nicer
sense
of
balance
than
many
american
ipas
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
moderate
head
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
lemony
hops
and
some
malts
the
taste
is
very
interesting
a
very
hoppy
mix
of
fresh
mown
hay
and
pronounced
lemon
this
beer
is
brewed
with
both
german
and
english
hops
that
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
unique
hop
profile
the
finish
is
very
bitter
and
citrusy
an
excellent
and
very
unique
beer
drinkability
a
refreshing
brew
for
a
hot
summers
day
just
enough
bitter
hoppiness
to
make
things
interesting
but
nothing
to
ponder
over
for
too
long
overall
an
excellent
brew
and
past
winner
of
several
camra
awards
i
have
had
the
cask
version
of
this
many
times
and
whilst
the
bottled
version
is
particularly
good
on
cask
it
has
a
little
more
sharpness
to
the
bitterness
and
the
hops
are
a
little
fresher
that
said
i
am
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
bottled
beers
from
the
uk
but
this
one
is
a
winner
for
sure
and
if
you
only
want
to
try
a
few
scottish
beers
from
the
bottle
make
sure
you
try
this
one
a
tad
expensive
but
recommended
drinkability
yeh
i
could
seriously
drink
3
of
these
right
now
but
i
only
bought
one
frown
pours
a
real
nice
clear
golden
color
with
a
thin
head
thats
gone
in
a
flasharoma
is
leafy
with
a
slight
hint
of
mint
with
a
light
yeastiness
to
it
as
well
flavor
is
on
the
dry
side
with
a
herbal
hopiness
balanced
out
nicely
with
a
firm
maltiness
in
the
finish
very
crisp
to
me
the
perfect
sociable
pint
very
easy
to
drink
low
in
alcohol
but
not
flavor
this
is
clear
golden
in
color
with
a
malty
grassy
hop
aroma
it
is
medium
bodied
and
creamy
with
an
herbal
hop
finish
there
is
some
citrus
as
well
in
the
finish
it
is
quite
bitter
but
there
is
enough
malt
to
make
sure
that
it
is
well
balanced
it
is
from
the
uk
but
if
you
didnt
know
you
might
think
it
came
from
a
west
coast
brewery
in
the
us
enjoy
this
confused
bitter
and
bring
on
the
60
l
crystal
malt
otherwise
this
is
one
fine
beer
i
had
this
as
one
of
my
first
beers
at
the
winking
lizard
tavern
in
columbus
cloudy
blonde
with
a
very
small
head
it
poured
smooth
i
could
smell
faint
citrus
possibly
orange
the
taste
was
really
good
hoppy
with
citrus
grapefruit
and
honey
character
very
smooth
finish
i
could
have
this
again
but
im
not
going
to
pursue
the
brew
taste
all
that
continues
on
the
tongue
sharp
pungent
but
rapidly
smoothing
on
the
palate
flavor
remains
singular
and
strong
great
tasty
malt
too
becoming
very
smooth
the
body
is
about
medium
finish
is
a
dry
long
with
hoppiness
lingering
the
helpful
label
informs
us
that
its
a
blend
of

drinkability
quite
drinkable
but
nothing
remarkable
very
light
straw
colored
beer
little
head
but
the
label
touts
the
low
carbonation
level
that
this
beer
should
have
the
aroma
when
first
poured
was
some
spicy
hop
aromas
but
they
quickly
faded
into
a
more
restrained
malt
hop
aroma
the
malt
and
hop
balance
is
well
done
and
quite
crisp
the
beer
arrives
on
the
palate
with
a
sweet
maltiness
then
goes
bitter
and
finishes
dry
if
you
crave
a
truetoname
regular
bitter
look
no
further
golden
blond
color
with
a
nice
layer
of
wellretaining

and
excellent

earthy
hops
biscuity

and
a
hint
of

linger
in
the
nose
pleasantly
hoppy
with

and
a
sturdy
biscuity

character
lead
to
a
zesty
citric
finish
beautifully
balanced
wonderfully
smooth
mouthfeel
reminds
me
of
caskconditioned
real
ale
though
its
from
a
bottle
immensely
drinkable
and
quenching
this
ale
screams
session
beer
overall
tons
of
flavor
and
character
are
packed
into
this
low
gravity
brew
great
stuff
drinkability

this
is
a
terrific
session
beer
that
went
down
well
during
the
october
playoffs
really
nice
session
ale
nice
fresh
citrusy
hop
aroma
lightly
caramelly
with
a
nicely
bitter
hop
citrus
again
finish
apparently
this
was
the
champion
beer
at
the
gbbf
2003
perhaps
not
worthy
of
that
accolade
but
still
a
nice
beer
all
the
same
cask
gbbf
03
flavor
this
is
a
light
bodied
ale
it
starts
out
slightly
citrusyhoppy
but
finishes
w
pronounced
bitterness
on
the
tongue
i
still
think
it
looks
a
lot
like
champange
i
hear
this
beer
won
best
of
britain
this
year
poured
from
a
stout
16
9
oz
brown
bottle
its
a
clear
gold
with
a
white
head
the
foams
up
nicely
in
addition
to
a
nice
malt
sweetness
it
has
a
nice
hop
aroma
and
hints
of
citrus
the
taste
is
also
quite
pleasant
if
a
bit
subdued
its
very
drinkable
and
at
4
2
it
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
a
clear
deep
golden
body
is
topped
by
a
creamy
offwhite
head
that
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
some
very
nice
lace
throughout
the
glass
the
nose
is
fresh
and
bright
with
lemony
floral
and
grassy
hops
its
not
overtly
bold
but
it
is
quite
welcoming
and
gently
refreshes
the
senses
with
each
sip
the
body
is
light
and
the
fine
carbonation
wakes
up
the
tastebuds
with
a
gentle
tingle
on
the
tongue
the
flavor
offers
a
lightly
sweet
malt
thats
solidly
infused
with
gently
spicy
and
lemony
hop
flavors
and
backed
by
a
firm
bitterness
it
finishes
crisp
and
dry
with
a
swirling
note
of
sweetish
malt
that
fades
to
lingering
bitterness
a
refreshing
pint
and
at
only
4
2
abv
it
makes
a
great
session
beer
for
fans
of
english
bitter
this
ones
a
charmer
had
this
at
the
2003
nerax
what
a
treat
nice
orangishbrown
color
great
hop
punch
with
a
nice
maltyhop
scent
extremely
smooth
beer
and
bitter
but
not
overly
bitter
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
bottled
version
now
nice
sweet
malt
taste
to
coincide
with
the
hop
flavor
a
real
treat
to
find
this
at
the
nerax
2003
bright
golden
in
color
with
mediumsized
bubbles
and
a
fast
fading
head
the
lace
is
thin
but
a
little
sticky
the
hoppy
aroma
is
slightly
mellowed
by
hints
of
lightly
roasted
malt
sharp
citrusy
bitterness
with
an
edgy
aggressiveness
mellows
sweetens
and
balances
out
toward
the
end
of
the
glass
very
gulpable
serving
type
bottle
as
much
as
i
do
enjoy
english
ipas
this
wasnt
for
me
i
found
its
hop
character
underwhelming
and
almost
off
putting
with
the
best
before
date
april
16th
i
dont
think
freshness
is
an
issue
perhaps
i
set
the
bar
in
my
mind
too
high
with
the
camra
award
on
the
label
i
wouldnt
pick
this
up
again
but
to
each
their
own
while
this
may
lay
claim
to
original
ipa
sin
which
very
well
could
be
true
it
matters
little
when
so
many
others
have
passed
them
on
by
in
the
time
since
yeah
the
hoppiness
here
is
more
acrid
and
disjointed
instead
of
integrated
and
tantalizingly
bitter
so
im
hardly
emboldened
to
seek
this
out
on
cask
or
any
other
format
really
o
a
very
plain
but
enjoyable
english
ipa
overall
agressive
fullflavored
english
ipa
rich
and
satisfying
its
just
5
6
abv
but
theres
so
much
character
here
that
it
seems
like
it
could
be
from
a
beer
thats
much
stronger
impressive
for
fans
of
english
ales
this
one
has
to
be
in
the
top
ten
or
so
to
try
the
taste
is
very
fruity
with
spicy
and
almost
cinnamonlike
taste
like
mulled
cider
with
woody
and
fruity
flavor
in
the
hops
with
mild
toasted
grain
and
light
caramel
tinge
from
the
malt
with
yeast
providing
a
deep
stone
fruit
essence
and
almost
black
cherry
taste
all
the
ingredients
are
cohesive
as
a
unit
with
deep
complexity
into
a
warming
and
mostly
dry
spicy
finish
ovearall
this
is
one
of
the
best
english
ipas
i
have
tasted
it
has
an
authentic
english
yeast
taste
with
great
complexity
and
very
drinkable
strengthwise
with
5
6
there
is
not
a
ton
of
hop
flavor
yet
it
is
still
flavorful
iwth
balance
of
bitterness
and
malt
iwth
nice
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
bottle
poured
an
amber
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
dry
english
style
hops
is
dominant
with
some
dry
caramel
malt
notes
also
perceptible
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
dry
english
style
hops
with
light
floral
undertones
some
white
pepper
notes
and
some
dry
caramel
malt
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
quite
enjoyable
and
nice
to
enjoy
a
nonamerican
style
ipa
once
in
a
while
enjoy
overall
definitely
needs
to
be
served
at
a
less
cool
temperature
to
have
a
chance
but
its
really
not
that
interesting
not
bad
and
better
than
your
mass
produced
beers
overall
didnt
taste
as
good
as
i
thought
it
would
based
on
the
high
review
score
its
an
okay
beer
but
with
fullers
products
on
the
shelf
close
by
no
reason
to
get
this
one
again
its
very
drinkable
but
unremarkable
this
is
an
excellent
english
ipa
very
restrained
by
american
or
modern
english
standards
but
an
extremely
quaffable
benchmark
and
classic
of
the
style
must
try
in
my
books
final
grade
3
62
a
b
i
dont
think
id
count
worthingtons
white
shield
amongst
my
favourite
english
ipas
but
its
still
a
respectable
traditional
example
of
the
style
that
i
can
easily
enjoy
for
what
it
is
the
price
and
overall
hohummedness
of
this
prevents
it
from
being
something
that
would
enter
my
uk
ale
rotation
but
its
not
every
day
a
new
camraapproved
ale
gets
imported
by
our
benevolent
government
liquor
monolith
so
i
appreciate
the
option
anyway
overall
very
fine
and
well
executed
eipa
with
good
hops
and
malts
balance
and
clean
finish
if
the
price
was
a
bit
better
a
definite
repeat
purchase
worthingtons
white
shield
is
indeed
as
its
advertised
for
true
ipa
connoisseurs
aside
from
its
history
theres
very
little
about
it
that
stands
out
and
no
other
reason
to
seek
it
out
this
may
be
the
longest
surviving
india
pale
ale
but
its
nowhere
near
the
best
or
even
very
good
this
is
one
of
the
uks
most
heavily
decorated
ales
i
guess
you
have
to
be
there
to
get
it
not
bad
but
not
something
i
would
revisit
if
i
am
looking
for
an
english
session
ale
i
think
there
are
better
choices
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
better
choices
in
the
style
taste
is
light
and
lively
but
slightly
oily
feel
strong
hop
character
woody
cedar
eucalyptus
herbal
mightly
medicinal
and
almost
minty
all
with
gently
dominant
and
engaging
zesty
bitterness
balanced
with
light
sweetness
of
caremlised
bread
crust
underneath
light
mineral
and
sulphur
the
character
and
feel
are
complex
engaging
bright
atmosphere
is
okay
deep
hue
giant
head
persistent
lacing
nose
is
hops
and
lemon
citrus
hoppy
and
soapy
not
much
else
overall
this
is
a
decent
quaff
different
but
the
floral
grows
on
the
nose
as
it
warms
overall
interesting
brew
nothing
wild
or
crazy
about
it
but
still
a
good
beer
and
good
representation
of
a
style
poured
from
500
ml
bottle
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
purchased
locally
in
austin
texas
overall
a
very
drinkable
english
ipa
mostly
dominated
by
caramel
with
some
floral
hops
the
only
problem
with
this
being
so
easy
to
put
down
is
that
one

bottle
is

ouch
o
love
it
im
partial
to
the
english
style
and
this
is
possibly
the
best
english
ipa
ive
run
into
so
far
namely
because
it
isnt
watered
down
often
a
hallmark
of
the
imported
english
pale
ale
family
it
stands
up
to
any
of
my
english
ale
favorites
with
enough
body
and
taste
to
please
any

drinker

i
will

have
to

creations

i
recommend
giving
it
a
try
to
anyone
rjt
the

is
outstanding

and
just
adds

and

the
pungent
briskness
fades
in

of
a

taste
overall
impression
definitely
the
ale
to
drink
in
burton
a
nice
depth
of
malt
flavor
that
tiptoes
between
bready
and
biscuity
with
firm
hop
bitterness
that
lasts
into
the
finish
a
fine
ale
to
enjoy
on
a
sunny
afternoon
or
a
rainy
cold
night
overall
a
very
good
representation
of
the
class
british
ipa
with
an
insanely
high
level
of
drinkability
these
are
on
sale
for
1
99
500ml
bottle
and
i
think
i
might
pick
up
an
entire
case
i
prefer
the
american
style
but
this
is
one
is
quite
good
poured
into
a
glass
mug
the
beer
pours
deep
hazy
copper
with
a
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
that
retreats
very
slowly
and
retains
well
throughout
consumption
there
are
lots
of
visible
tiny
bubbles
rising
in
this
beer
some
lacing
is
left
behind
on
the
glass
during
consumption
there
are
aromas
of
brown
bread
and
toffee
i
also
detect
some
floral
and
citrus
notes
along
with
the
english
yeast
the
first
sip
brings
that
brown
bread
and
toffee
but
the
toffee
notes
arent
too
sweet
i
get
the
citrus
and
some
nice
back
end
hop
bitterness
that
isnt
too
bitter
and
the
english
yeast
comes
through
pretty
well
it
has
that
unmistakable
burton
ale
flavor
with
a
good
mineral
quality
the
long
lasting
head
actually
adds
a
bit
of
creaminess
that
im
just
not
used
to
when
i
take
a
sip
of
this
beer
the
flavors
are
wonderfully
wellbalanced
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
dry
and
smooth
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
i
would
recommend
no
wonder
the
french
killed
the
order
this
beer
is
ok
nothing
special
nothing
bad
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
on
tap
but
i
certainly
will
not
be
launching
3
journeys
into
enemy
lands
for
it
m
wellbalanced
and
refreshing
to
taste

english

mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
higher
carbonation
associated
with
this
english
style
what
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
this
must
be
the
reason
to
be
almost
300
years
old
in
business
glad
to
see
that
still
to
be
now
owned
by
a
global
major
company
they
are
truly
faithful
to
the
style
actually
it
is
claimed
to
be
the
oldest
surviving
ipa
very
hoppy
for
english
beers
but
not
overwhelming
as
some
american
ipas
can
be
ps
anyway
not
to
a
hop
head
like
this
one
pours
a
rich
ambercopper
color
some
haze
big
white
head
that
expands
quickly
with
a
hard
pour
solid
chunks
of
lace
sticking
to
the
walls
of
the
glass
very
pretty
beer
lots
of
english
hops
in
the
aroma
im
not
good
at
this
but
my
guess
would
be
goldings
it
has
a
sweet
citrus
aroma
shot
through
with
a
peppery
spice
im
not
enjoying
the
malt
contribution
as
much
the
caramel
sweetness
is
a
bit
limp
and
doesnt
quite
have
that
luxurious
quality
of
that
i
love
in
other
english
beers
perhaps
a
touch
of
diacetyl
not
that
its
a
problem
just
a
little
english
twist
the
taste
adds
an
interesting
mineral
note
but
loses
some
hop
brightness
the
malt
is
still
a
bit
underwhelming
the
bitterness
seems
to
have
that
lasting
dry
flavor
that
i
think
of
coming
from
burtons
hard
water
still
the
beer
either
needs
a
richer
malt
sweetness
or
a
drier
profile
the
malt
bill
kinda
plays
the
middle
and
doesnt
do
a
great
job
of
it
good
yeasty
mildly
bitter
finish
though
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
mouthfeel
is
relatively
gentle
the
attempt
to
mimic
cask
ale
doesnt
work
all
that
well
but
its
a
good
thought
i
recommend
a
relatively
hard
pour
and
patience
the
drying
finish
helps
a
lot
drinks
easily
its
always
fun
to
try
a
good
english
beer
too
few
make
it
across
the
atlantic
o
a
good
ipa
nice
flavor
profile
just
the
right
ratio
of
malt
to
hops
could
use
a
little
more
depth
in
the
aroma
would
definitely
have
again
poured
into
a
samuel
smith
imperial
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
orange
amber
with
a
healthy
three
finger
very
light
tan
head
and
pillowy
lacing
light
aroma
of
biscuit
malt
and
grassy
spicy
hops
flavor
of
biscuit
and
bready
malt
with
light
earthy
and
grassy
hops
nicely
balanced
and
a
great
combination
of
malt
and
light
hops
finishes
with
very
faint
hops
and
malt
medium
bodied
a
quite
pleasant
english
style
ipa
i
suspect
the
long
shipping
time
has
muted
the
hops
somewhat
and
this
is
nice
enough
that
i
hope
i
can
drink
a
fresh
version
some
day
with
a
bit
more
hops
o
by
the
last
few
sips
i
was
convinced
that
this
is
easily
the
best
english
ipa
from
the
home
country
that
ive
tried
quite
possibly
the
most
hopbitter
british
ale
ive
had
and
i
hesitate
saying
that
with
old
engine
oil
coming
to
mind
it
could
use
a
little
more
malt
grain
biscuitsweetness
or
less
hops
dare
i
say
but
this
was
a
fantastic
experience
cant
wait
to
revisit
this
one
a
fantastic
representation
of
the
style
perfectly
balanced
if
youve
been
drinking
west
coast
ipas
for
a
while
try
this
out
for
a
nice
change
of
pace
to
find
out
just
how
versatile
the
style
truly
is

nice
change
from

is
as

the

and
it

i
loved
this
beer
if
i
were
a
civil
servant
in
calcutta
in
1799
and
had
this
delivered
on
the
last
boat
from
burtonupontrent
id
be
overjoyed
very
clean
thin
almost
watery
on
the
finish
sweet
malts
some
fig
jam
on
toast
like
flavors
rolls
into
a
faint
butteryness
finishes
dry
with
a
leafy
hop
character
flavors
are
subdued
and
the
body
while
being
a
little
thin
is
almost
too
big
to
allow
these
soft
flavors
show
it
does
a
good
job
of
having
that
cask
ale
mouthfeel
out
of
a
bottle
but
its
just
a
little
dull
bitterness
is
nice
though
could
be
my
new
world
palate
trying
to
review
a
true
old
world
style
not
my
cup
of
tea
though
d
hoopier
than
other
english
ipas
ive
had
and
drier
to
boot
not
terribly
complex
but
flavorful
and
tasty
enough
to
win
me
over
i
could
session
the
hell
out
of
this
one
overall
holy
hell
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
keep
in
mind
i
have
an
extreme
anglo
bias
but
nonetheless
this
is
probably
the
best
bottled
english
beer
ive
tried
this
is
exactly
what
its
style
should
be
and
immensely
drinkable
is
it
big
and
bold
like
most
of
the
higherranking
beers
on
this
site
no
but
it
is
just
as
if
not
more
complex
and
arguably
tastes
even
better
ill
be
buying
more
of
these
without
hesitation
the
only
downsides
are
its
fairly
limited
availability
and
that
its
a
little
high
in
abv
to
be
considered
a
session
ale
but
its
still
an
amazing
beer
one
of
the
darker
ipas
out
there
with
straying
too
far
from
the
norm
it
was
pretty
ordinary
although
not
boring
throughout
and
had
just
about
enough
to
keep
me
interested
without
warranting
a
second
tasting
the
mouthfeel
reminds
me
of
cask
experiences
very
lightly
carbonated
making
the
beer
a
little
less
prickly
and
a
little
less
filling
the
finish
is
dry
which
when
coupled
with
the
lightly
sweet
opening
makes
this
an
easier
beer
to
drink
taste
is
fruity
and
malty
with
a
mild
floral
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
the
flavors
overall
are
quite
light
and
gives
the
beer
a
muted
flavor
even
at
50
degrees
or
so
the
taste
of
carbonation
and
alcohol
seem
to
be
the
biggest
players
here
this
surprises
me
as
the
label
claims
closer
to
cask
for
a
fuller
flavor
i
expected
something
low
on
carbonation
and
richly
malted
it
also
boasts
our
finest
ipa
for
true
ipa
connoisseurs
and
i
surely
didnt
find
that
to
be
the
case
upon
even
further
inspection
this
particular
bottle
was
brewed
by
tenth
and
blake
beer
co
molsoncoors
so
i
guess
i
am
not
too
surprised
by
this
lackluster
offering
perhaps
the
original
english
ale
if
there
ever
was
one
is
a
better
brew
than
this
o
a
classic
english
ipa
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
theres
a
lot
to
love
here
the
casklike
mouthfeel
in
particular
is
quite
nice
food
match
this
is
one
ale
that
would
suit
a
decent
thai
curry
like
a
massaman
or
penang
curry
with
the
obligatory
side
of
coconut
rice
their
description
says
they
are
using
the
same
recipe
since
1830
when
ipas
were
transported
to
the
far
east
to
me
this
is
the
way
a
british
ipa
should
be
the
hops
do
not
cause
me
to
pucker
up
but
they
keep
the
overall
sweet
malty
flavor
alive
i
bet
the
british
colonies
in
burma
loved
this
one

deep

this

of

the

it

the
taste
although
good
and
reflective
of
the
smell
is
far
milder
than
i
expected
and
in
fact
were
it
not
labelled
an
ipa
id
have
guessed
it
wasnt
and
was
just
a
pale
ale
it
has
a
medium
long
finish
and
was
a
little
soapy
in
the
aftertaste
so
rare
to
see
a
true
english
ipa
available
this
one
is
pretty
good
and
im
sure
it
would
be
nice
on
cask
o
a
fine
english
ipa
and
one
of
the
more
authentic
examples
of
the
style
on
the
market
maybe
i
am
an
ignorant
american
or
maybe
the
molson
coors
brewing
company
ruined
this
beer
but
when
i
drink
an
ipa
i
want
it
to
take
and
smell
like
hops
and
malt
this
doesnt
white
shield
after
sampling
red
shield
last
night
this
english
ipa
pours
a
very
very
light
bodied
polished
bronze
in
color
with
a
two
finger
off
white
head
and
loads
of
carbonation
the
nose
is
decently
balanced
there
are
english
hops
with
slight
caramel
malt
character
and
a
defined
somewhat
different
bitterness
the
flavors
present
what
the
nose
initially
offered
it
features
light
english
hops
and
a
good
amount
of
caramel
malt
with
slight
minerality
its
ok
this
beer
wont
wow
you
by
any
means
but
it
is
true
to
the
style
and
well
made
for
what
it
is
what
can
you
say
about
the
original
ipa
this
is
what
all
brewers
should
be
striving
for
a
hop
bomb
can
be
fun
for
a
minute
but
over
time
balance
will
take
the
day
thank
goodness
this
classic
beer
has
survived
so
great
to
see
it
over
here
in
the
states
easy
drinking
pale
ale
with
nice
flowing
mouthfeel
ever
so
slightly
over
carbonated
and
still
a
good
port
in
a
storm
and
benchmark
beer
o
this
beer
transports
me
to
england
sitting
in
a
pub
drinking
pint
after
pint
of
this
wellbalanced
ipa
and
chatting
it
up
a
perfect
session
ipa
if
ever
there
was
one
the
moderate
hops
carefully
balance
the
malt
side
for
a
beer
thats
one
hell
of
an
easy
drinker
i
wonder
if
this
has
suffered
at
the
hands
of
molson
coors
od
what
a
shame
this
should
be
much
fresher
to
be
good
its
just
malt
really
there
is
barely
any
english
hop
profile
to
speak
of
and
whats
there
is
too
light
and
not
assertive
or
balanced
too
bad
the
smell
is
rather
neutral
nothing
really
to
smell
the
taste
has
some
bitterness
in
it
in
the
aftertaste
not
bad
a
decent
brew
but
no
champion
in
my
books
it
looks
great
and
has
a
good
body
but
the
aroma
is
lacklustre
and
the
flavour
just
isnt
as
hoppy
or
aromatic
as
i
expected
this
ipas
reputation
preceeds
it
and
i
was
hoping
for
more
oh
well
worth
sampling
but
not
worldclass
o
gotta
admit
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
as
it
really
disappointed
me
with
the
ipa
moniker
even
though
it
is
english
i
just
didnt
like
the
dominant
malt
profile
or
that
funky
malt
smell
in
the
nose
apart
from
that
its
a
decent
beer
objectively
speaking
but
not
one
id
probably
ever
buy
again
i
will
say
i
prefer
it
to
something
like
coopers
vintage
which
for
me
it
tastes
similar
to
2
5
mouth
feel
was
just
fine
and
drinkability
was
amazing
considering
a
worthy
experiment
in
its
own
right
so
i
have
no
regrets
d
very
nice
one
of
my
favorites
from
a
bottle
could
have
2
not
3
ive
always
liked
this
beer
but
thats
as
far
as
it
goes
sure
ive
always
appreciated
it
it
comes
from
an
incredible
pedigree
and
it
is
iconic
for
what
it
represents
ie
as
one
of
the
very
last
sole
surviving
bottle
conditioned
british
beers
before
camra
took
off
but
in
the
end
it
is
as
exciting
as
paul
mccartney
and
wings
carbonation
is
too
high
a
distraction
from
the
malt
a
very
good
english
ipa
that
has
fallen
somewhat
short
of
my
high
expectations
it
seems
bigger
and
more
alcoholic
than
the
5
6
suggests
d
good
enjoyable
tastes
and
easy
to
drink
will
definately
drink
again
theres
something
refined
about
a
real
eipa
compared
to
some
of
the
in
your
face
aipas
that
are
turning
up
lately
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
obviously
not
as
hop
dominant
as
an
aipa
but
thats
the
point
some
seem
to
miss
the
balance
is
excellent
soft
piney
hop
notes
are
in
line
with
the
solid
caramel
malt
hints
alcohol
is
not
particularly
evident
carbonation
is
spot
on
grippy
bitterness
finishes
it
off
brilliantly
this
is
how
its
done
d
a
good
example
of
an
english
ipa
very
hoppy
in
the
taste
but
not
overpowering
which
is
common
in
ipa
probably
the
best
beer
in
the
worthington
range
overall
a
great
example
of
a
very
enjoyable
beer
style
warming
on
the
palate
the
alcohol
does
seem
to
shine
through
despite
it
being
under
6
4
5
m4
d
overall
very
rounded
and
smooth
and
the
body
is
wellbalanced
but
thick
enough
on
texture
to
buttress
the
med
full
flavour
a
moderate
ipa
it
is
but
a
rich
one
by
english
standards
very
enjoyable
beer
worth
seeking
out
it
is
well
carbonated
and
not
too
heavy
i
could
drink
this
all
night
with
ease
with
a
beautiful
balance
of
hop
and
malt
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
india
pale
ale
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
of
the
better
english
bottled
beers
ive
had
white
shield
has
been
an
english
institution
well
before
coors
took
over
its
care
i
am
pleased
to
report
it
is
still
as
good
as
i
remember
it
being
back
in
the
70s
and
80s
which
is
when
i
last
had
any
a
very
pleasant
example
of
the
english
ipa
style
a
rare
example
of
an
original
ipa
and
well
worth
drinking
even
if
it
was
from
a
bottle
and
only
500ml
instead
of
a
pint
mouthfeel
was
thin
to
medium
in
body
medium
to
light
carbonation
d
nice
packaging
but
carbonation
overpowers
whatever
else
is
going
on
in
this
beer
i
wont
be
looking
for
this
one
again
a
tasty
english
ipa
well
worth
the
try
other
comments
finally
trying
the
legendary
white
shield
its
a
nice
hearty
bitter
crisp
ipa
definitely
would
like
to
try
maturing
one
for
up
to
3
years
as
the
label
suggests
d
very
drinkable
strong
in
every
area
with
the
mouthfeel
being
particularly
enjoyable
highly
recommend
all
in
all
try
a
bottle
despite
tasting
like
its
a
little
old
its
holding
up
very
well
definitely
worth
a
sample
depending
on
the
bottle
you
get
man
you
could
do
worse
than
have
this
as
a
standard
everyday
beer
high
enough
on
taste
but
easy
on
abv
though
at
9
each
the
bank
account
would
take
a
beating
mostly
clear
dark
orange
colour
with
a
large
dense
whipped
cream
white
head
looks
impressive
in
the
glass
the
head
rises
well
above
the
rim
and
holds
its
form
remarkably
well
large
clumps
of
foam
adorn
the
glass
aroma
is
a
little
fruity
peach
orange
with
hints
of
honey
and
pine
but
i
also
get
some
vanilla
and
icecream
aromas
flavour
doesnt
seem
to
be
quite
as
strong
as
the
aroma
but
is
fairly
bitter
hoppy
and
tastes
of
vanilla
and
cream
the
head
is
creamy
over
the
lips
but
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
500
ml
bottle
bought
at
selfridges
london
this
bottle
conditioned
original
ipa
has
a
slightly
hazy
deep
golden
colour
and
a
fluffy
head
the
hops
are
what
its
all
about
in
the
aroma
and
flavour
lovely
citrussy
aroma
with
hints
of
oak
and
leather
flavour
has
a
distinct
resinlike
bitterness
with
notes
of
grapefruit
on
a
subdued
background
of
dusty
malty
sweetness
interesting
beer
this
beer
was
such
a
damn
tease
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
nice
carbonation
pours
a
cloudy
copper
with
a
huge
pillowy
white
head
that
takes
quite
some
time
to
settle
it
leaves
behind
some
nice
lace
on
the
glass
but
i
became
impatient
waiting
for
the
head
to
dissipate
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
bread
and
caramel
with
some
nice
spicey
hops
begins
sweet
with
caramel
and
malt
flavors
dominating
then
becomes
bitter
with
herbal
and
spicey
hops
the
sweetbitter
balance
is
quite
good
has
a
medium
body
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
very
quaffable
quite
a
nice
brew
i
love
the
floral
hops
here
yum
12oz
cans
ftw
tried
a
fresh
single
was
a
12oz
can
i
thought
it
was
a
good
ipa
5

abv
you
can
session
this
beer
pretty
good
ipa
but
kind
of
generic
its
very
well
rounded
and
overall
a
great
beer
when
you
just
want
an
ipa
but
dont
want
to
overdo
it
on
hops
pours
a
straw
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
head
the
smell
is
full
of
grapefruit
notes
the
taste
was
simple
yet
very
tasty
with
the
hops
being
center
stage
the
light
grapefruit
bitterness
was
balanced
well
by
the
malt
and
made
for
a
refreshing
finish
really
good
has
passed
multiple
taste
tests
and
remains
in
the
rotation
o
really
well
made
english
ipa
overall
another
marvelous
beer
from
berkshire
im
glad
to
see
them
really
hit
the
ball
out
of
the
park
with
this
english
ipa
i
think
its
rated
lower
by
people
who
expect
an
american
style
ipa
and
are
then
surprised
by
the
subtlety
in
this
one
the
hops
used
in
this
beer
are
magnificent
and
provide
a
really
rare
flavor
for
those
used
to
the
traditional
american
varietals
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
with
the
caveat
that
you
know
its
not
an
american
ipa
and
you
should
not
expect
it
to
taste
like
a
citrus
bomb
45
o
this
was
really
good
not
much
more
to
say
enjoyed
from
bottle
into
tulip
glass
cloudy
orange
colour
with
a
pleasant
hoppy
aroma
and
nice
full
maltiness
maybe
more
hopped
up
than
most
english
examples
this
is
quite
pleasantly
sessionable
and
balanced
certainly
an
enjoyable
session
ipa
nice
flavour
complexity
and
hop
profile
very
clean
and
crisp
on
finish
second
try
confirms
hops
could
be
more
noteworthy
but
the
malt
really
shines
through
here
lack
of
aroma
keeps
this
from
being
better
overall
fun
sessiony
ipa
from
this
western
mass
brewer
the
term
session
ipa
makes
a
lot
of
folks
groan
but
this
is
a
very
well
executed
one
a
good
everyday
beer
and
a
good
companion
for
any
meal
o
seems
a
bit
lighter
than
i
remember
but
the
malt
and
cedar
combo
is
very
pleasing
this
is
sure
to
become
a
regular
in
my
beer
drinking
rotation
now
that
is
in
convenient
12
ounce
cans
o
not
sure
i
would
revisit
maybe
on
a
hot
day
with
little
other
offerings
i
have
enjoyed
other
beers
from
this
brewer
but
this
is
not
their
best
offering
o
good
offering
was
expecting
more
hops
but
i
enjoyed
it
o
this
is
just
lame
idk
if
this
is
a
bad
batch
or
what
but
im
shocked
at
the
rating
it
has
it
taste
like
what
i
would
assume
would
be
dirty
dishwater
so
wheres
the
hops
at
least
on
t
his
i
dont
care
if
its
english
at
least
ive
had
a
bunch
that
at
least
have
hop
character
i
really
hope
this
is
not
the
epitome
of
what
this
beer
should
taste
like
o
another
solid
offering
from
bbc
very
nice
example
of
an
english
ipa
from
an
american
brewery
delicious
easy
to
drink
and
at
4
a
22oz
everybody
wins
o
a
very
good
take
on
the
style
by
an
american
brewery
the
goldings
hops
work
extremely
well
with
the
maltiness
giving
off
the
distinct
spiciness
that
makes
it
almost
seem
like
there
is
rye
in
the
malt
bill
very
drinkable
and
easy
on
the
wallet
at
4
for
a
bomber
more
of
an
english
than
an
american
ipa
but
i
guess
its
listed
that
way
so
ill
shut
up
about
the
particulars
this
is
just
genuine
beer
here
looking
right
on
all
light
amber
clear
and
heady
the
nose
is
intensely
malty
odd
for
an
ipa
but
one
sip
confirms
its
documented
genre
a
real
ipa
its
bitter
but
its
also
punchy
and
fruit
in
some
sense
a
real
anomaly
as
they
go
listening
to
a
further
stream
late
night
on
the
east
coast
bands
in
red
rocks
and
i
know
this
is
contextual
romantic
and
highly
contingent
but
this
beer
is
currently
continuing
the
long
strange
trip
and
that
means
something
to
me
as
in
a
4
00
overall
score
on
a
beer
i
only
sort
of
like
the
moment
is
everything
people
seize
it
before
you
cant
go
dead
go
berkshire
and
go
insatiable
appetite
for
fine
ale
this
fits
the
bill
on
all
counts
love
the
feel
and
the
staying
power
and
the
buzz
rock
on
awesome
local
brew
from
new
england
one
of
my
favorite
beers
better
out
of
a
growler
then
a
bottle
a
good
but
not
awesome
ipa
had
this
on
tap
at
the
marthas
vineyard
chowder
co
decent
color
but
id
prefer
a
bit
darker
probably
non
coincidentally
the
smell
was
pleasant
but
not
super
robust
i
couldve
used
more
hops
citrusy
crisp
floral
decent
flavor
the
beer
appeared
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
light
white
foamy
head
that
dissipated
into
a
small
thin
cap
nothing
too
impressive
perhaps
slightly
above
average
the
beer
gave
off
a
hoppier
aroma
than
was
expected
from
an
english
ipa
but
light
citrus
hops
the
taste
again
was
overpowered
by
the
hops
for
the
style
this
style
is
typically
a
bit
more
balanced
than
say
an
american
ipa
no
real
complexity
to
it
just
straight
citrus
hops
the
beer
had
a
good
feel
to
it
and
finished
with
a
decent
dry
but
bitter
aftertaste
and
was
easy
to
drink
overall
too
hoppy
for
the
style
i
expected
a
little
more
balance
but
even
if
it
was
just
an
ipa
it
is
average
at
best
o
4
75
its
really
unfortunate
that
i
dont
have
easy
access
to
this
beer
any
longer
to
me
its
the
best
american
example
of
a
classic
eipa
on
the
market
and
accentuates
all
the
best
features
of
east
kent
golding
on
a
maris
otter
backbone
for
those
in
new
england
considering
how
affordable
it
is
3
99bomber
and
7
99growler
before
deposit
definitely
worth
hunting
down
for
those
outside
of
new
england
who
enjoy
classic
british
bitters
or
eipas
like
fullers
esb
or
samuel
smith
pale
ale
its
definitely
worth
a
trade
o
nice
to
have
a
good
englishstyle
ipa
every
once
in
a
while
this
one
is
restrained
and
tasty
with
a
great
mouthfeel
the
golding
hops
are
expressive
without
being
aggressive
overall
no
major
flaws
but
not
the
best
of
bbc
its
adequate
and
i
would
rate
it
well
as
berkshire
has
not
done
me
wrong
in
the
past
but
this
is
not
their
finest
product
amazing
creamy
head
with
chunks
of
foam
clinging
to
the
rim
of
the
glass
after
a
few
sips
nice
lace
down
the
glass
thats
not
going
anywhere
until
the
next
pour
hazy
golden
body
that
likes
to
play
with
light
for
added
complexity
kind
of
light
amber
like
the
actual
mineral
held
up
to
light
not
much
hits
me
in
the
nose
but
as
i
search
a
juicy
mouthwatering
citrus
orangecookie
aroma
comes
through
really
dig
the
flavors
though
very
well
balanced
enough
hop
presence
that
you
know
its
an
ipa
but
enough
satisfying
malt
contrast
to
be
solidly
english
rather
than
american
style
as
it
warms
some
dark
fruit
sweetness
comes
through
quickly
cut
by
drying
bitterness
some
tobacco
and
earthy
fresh
cut
grass
in
the
finish
really
juicy
and
easy
to
drink
refreshing
as
spring
even
as
autumn
settles
in
orangelemon
rind
with
some
melon
grape
notes
finishing
like
a
crusty
rustic
baguette
complex
and
good
nonextreme
with
nothing
lacking
overall
its
a
rather
smooth
ipa
while
if
you
are
looking
for
something
very
hoppy
this
may
not
be
your
brew
but
if
you
are
looking
for
something
very
easy
to
drink
with
some
nice
flavors
this
is
a
nice
brew
to
go
to
o
fresh
and
delicious
bbc
hit
this
style
on
the
head
i
dont
have

ipas
very
often
so
this
is
a
breath
of
fresh
air
loved
the
fruit
aspect

picked
up
a
bomber
from
beverage
warehouse
in
winsooski
vt
like
the
traditional
pale
ale
this
is
a
more
malty
take
on
the
style
theres
a
clean
bready
toasty
malt
character
under
the
citus
piney
hops
bite
its
not
that
similar
to
brooklyn
ipa
this
is
significantly
maltier
still
a
tasty
beer
theres
just
a
big
sweet
biscuit
toast
that
matches
the
hops
o
i
think
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
its
been
in
the
growler
transported
by
car
all
the
way
down
from
massachusetts
to
richmond
va
and
i
think
that
has
definitely
had
an
impact
on
the
quality
that
being
said
i
think
this
beer
is
great
even
despite
these
detractions
if
you
can
get
your
mitts
on
this
beer
do
it
4
5
o
just
too
bland
and
lacking
in
hop
flavor
as
an
ipa
for
me
decent
if
you
want
an
unfiltered
pale
though
ultimately
delicious
and
well
brewed
d
this
is
a
pretty
nice
very
drinkable
beer
but
it
is
kind
of
an
anemic
ipa
the
hop
aroma
is
noticeable
but
not
nearly
as
pungent
as
a
hop
lover
would
hop
it
might
be
and
the
flavor
profile
is
thoroughly
dominated
by
the
malt
this
all
makes
for
a
very
nice
pale
ale
and
it
could
be
a
great
ipa
if
it
had
about
4x
as
much
hop
character
as
it
does
bought
this
on
a
whim
5
bucks
not
worth
it
though
pours
an
orange
rust
color
with
a
semiclear
consistency
and
a
resilient
head
nose
carries
a
mild
but
zesty
lemon
citrus
and
floral
sweet
aroma
tasty
ripe
orange
and
lemon
citrus
acidity
really
hits
the
palate
with
a
wellrounded
bitterness
sessionable
ipa
for
sure
a
decent
english
ipa
but
just
not
doing
it
for
me
a
drink
with
more
malt
and
earthiness
than
currently
popular
ipa
you
find
these
days
beautifully
golden
with
a
healthy
amount
of
head
and
lace
aroma
is
muted
some
malt
and
a
tiny
bit
of

flavor
is
traditional

toward
the
end
medium
body
and
soft
mouthfeel
ill
pass
the
next
time
im
offered
a
bottle
of
this
one
a
solid
representation
of
the
english
india
pale
ale
o
good
beer
different
than
i
last
remember
more
hazy
this
time
around
and
less
bitterness
qualities
with
a
lot
more
sweetness
involved
not
your
typical
ipa
more
like
a
american
pale
ale
and
west
coasters
will
probably
lament
the
lack
of
hops
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
nothing
miraculous
overall
a
nice
ipa
glad
to
have
been
able
to
try
it
and
would
certainly
have
it
again
if
the
opportunity
presented
itself
however
i
wouldnt
go
out
in
search
of
it
this
sht
is
the
sht
for
realsies
im
super
cereal
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
gotta
love
the
growler
its
comes
in
its
like
a
party
in
my
mouth
better
then
the
time
i
watched
kazamm
if
someone
beat
me
over
the
head
with
a
beer
bottle
with
lost
sailor
ipa
in
it
i
wouldnt
mind
as
long
as
they
poored
some
in
my
battered
and
bruised
mouth
pours
a
hazy
orangecopper
with
a
singlefinger
white
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
nose
carries
some
light
floral
hops
and
some
bread
though
theres
also
a
bit
of
solventy
character
slight
but
noticeable
the
flavor
is
along
the
same
lines
though
the
solvent
character
is
mostly
gone
thankfully
the
mouthfeel
is
the
redeeming
aspect
as
theres
a
nice
amount
of
dry
bitterness
after
swallowing
the
mediumbodied
brew
light
to
moderate
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
though
not
something
id
seek
out
again
a
good
brew
not
sure
of
abv
but
evident
through
22oz

overall
a
decent
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
it
i
see
it
on
the
shelf
and
i
am
not
hunting
for
something
particular
from

the
taste
then
closes
with
a
bitter
dry

i
dont
know
if
i
was
dehydrated
or
what
but
it
finished
very
dry
tasted
hints
of
orange
pear
lemon
has
some
spice
to
it
medium
light
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
ipa
id
get
it
again
but
id
choose
others
before
it
not
a
huge
english
ipa
fan
o
this
wasnt
bad
overall
when
i
ordered
this
with
dinner
i
didnt
realize
this
was
a
smaller
english
ipa
so
i
guess
i
was
expecting
something
different
let
me
preference
the
overall
with
this
is
the
last
of
this
beer
apparently
the
type
of
hops
bbc
was
using
is
no
longer
available
so
once
this
batch
is
gone
its
gone
for
good
that
being
said
this
is
a
great
beer
very
well
rounded
with
no
one
thing
jumping
out
but
the
sum
of
it
making
an
excellent
beer
an
easy
beer
that
goes
with
anything
get
it
while
you
can
o
i
like
this
beer
very
much
while
the
appearances
smell
and
mouthfeel
i
found
to
be
about
average
the
flavor
is
there
in
full
wow
it
has
been
a
while
since
someone
poured
me
a
draft
i
p
a
that
was
this
fresh
it
is
quite
noticeable
pours
clear
reddish
color
white
head
great
retention
that
laces
the
glass
smells
of
floral
hops
and
sweetness
tastes
citrusy
with
a
complimentary
sweet
malt
flavor
fruity
yeast
esters
that
i
assumed
were
coming
from
an
english
yeast
just
a
touch
watery
on
the
mouthfeel
at
least
for
my
taste
really
my
only
complaint
about
the
beer
ipa
is
a
competitive
category
of
beer
that
i
am
particularly
picky
with
i
had
two
it
was
highly
drinkable
for
me
cheers
drinkability
really
smooth
drinking
english
ipa
fruity
bready
and
sweet
malts
are
balanced
by
floral
and
spicy
hops
similar
to
the
traditional
pale
in
terms
of
drinkability
and
balance
a
great
and
dependable
beer
plus
at
a
price
of
3
49
for
a
bomber
i
will
never
hesitate
because
i
am
local
to
the
brewery
i
am
able
to
enjoy
the
lost
sailor
in
both
freshly
poured
growlers
as
well
as
220z
bottles
i
do
enjoy
it
in
both
delivery
methods
as
well
as
locally
on
draught
drink
was
average
im
not
that
anxious
to
have
it
again
but
it
wasnt
bad
thanks
again

md
medium
bodied
and
quite
smooth
very
drinkable
a
nice
example
of
an
english
ipa
a
great
deal
as
well
for
the
price
feels
a
little
on
the
watery
side
but
goes
down
real
easy
and
the
lingering
aftertaste
wont
let
you
forget
what
you
just
drank
overall
i
like
the
name
better
than
the
beer
i
probably
would
not
buy
a
bottle
again
but
i
would
order
it
in
a
bar
if
seen
on
tap
or
cask
mouthfeel
is
average
and
the
carbonation
seems
perfect
this
is
a
really
easy
one
to
drink
and
the
low
abv
helps
id
be
curious
to
try
this
one
fresher
but
you
can
tell
this
was
never
intended
to
be
a
hopbomb
some
great
malt
flavors
a
lot
of
ipas
are
lacking
though
d
good
enjoyable
especially
at
these
prices
great
job
bbc
i
enjoy
when
i
brewery
takes
the
time
to
create
a
well
balanced
easy
drinking
yet
very
flavorful
ipa
most
brewerys
are
more
focused
on
who
can
shove
the
most
hops
down
your
gullet
as
apposed
to
creating
something
distinct
and
original
overall
verdict
my
very
favorite
ipa
the
hops
are
not
off
the
hook
as
tends
to
be
the
trend
these
days
it
tastes
great
and
is
very
drinkable
sessionwise
highly
reccomended
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
tingly
carbonation
i
felt
the
bitter
taste
on
the
roof
of
my
mouth
and
it
lingered
nicely
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
it
was
very
pleasant
and
soft
soft
is
the
word
that
keeps
coming
to
mind
with
this
beer
good
balance
of
citrus
hoppiness
and
smooth
malt
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
with
little
carbonation
theres
nothing
overbearing
or
offensive
about
this
ipa
its
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
and
id
recommend
it
for
anyone
whos
just
starting
out
with
quality
ipas
overall
this
is
a
good
solid
ipa
the
price
point
is
pretty
fantastic
as
well
3
99
a
bomber
when
the
next
cheapest
is
5
49
d
given
that
this
is
a
low
abv
beer
and
that
it
tastes
quite
goodinteresting
id
say
that
this
has
a
pretty
high
drinkability
thanks
again

nice

with
obvious

faint

aroma
in

with
a

the
taste
is
very
different
for
an
ipa
slightly
bitter
but
not
really
slight
tropical
fruit
taste
almost
like
a
9

even
a

love
so
much
bottle
dating
is
ambiguous
since
it
says
good
until
4511
im
guessing
thats
a
6
month
date
way
too
long
for
most
ipas
and
if
so
that
makes
this
one
2
months
old
hard
to
tell
overall
i
like
this
one
but
its
not
your
typical
ipa
and
if
you
are
looking
for
a
giant
hop
bomb
you
might
be
looking
in
the
wrong
place
d
regardless
of
the
strong
earthiness
of
this
ipa
the
exquisite
balance
and
smooth
mouthfeel
create
a
very
drinkable
beer
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
crisp
and
refreshing
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
keep
going
with
this
and
since
i
have
a
growler
i
guess
i
will
recommended
and
the
fresher
the
better
drinkability
a
beer
to
embrace
what
with
its
pleasant
mix
of
flavors
and
ease
of
drinkability
though
those
hoping
for
a
bold
audacious
west
coaststyle
ipa
may
be
frustrated
with
this
mouthfeel
is
solid
and
has
a
bit
of
a
creamy
texture
very
nice
overall
a
very
enjoyable
ipa
and
its
nice
to
have
one
with
an
english
take
on
the
style
for
a
change
dlike
i
said
above
this
beer
doesnt
try
to
overwhelm
you
with
hops
its
a
solid
ipa
with
no
pretense
worthy
of
being
part
of
you
everyday
beer
line
up
overall
a
really
solid
ipa
that
is
crisp
and
refreshing
and
not
overpowering
very
enjoyable
from
the
22
oz
bottle
with
an
expiration
date
of
040511
sampled
on
oct
23
2010
the
pour
is
a
cloudy
amberorange
tone
with
yellow
highlights
about
two
inches
of
soapy
offwhite
head
float
along
the
top
and
stick
around
various
herbs
pine
and
mellow
hops
tickle
the
nose
whle
the
taste
also
features
these
sensations
there
is
also
a
pleasant
laid
back
sweet
maltiness
mixed
in
the
hops
on
the
whole
are
more
subtle
than
some
ipas
and
for
me
that
is
magnificent
but
for
those
of
you
who
like
your
ipas
hoppy
you
might
not
be
as
satisfied
just
right
for
me
though
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
carbonated
giving
a
crispness
the
alcohol
is
none
existent
great
standard
for
an
ipa
thanks
bbc
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
ipa
that
is
damn
good
without
sacrificing
complexity
in
favor
of
being
a
hop
bomb
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
better
values
ive
seen
in
a
while
at
less
than
5
for
22oz
my
grandfolks
live
in
the
berkshires
and
for
the
past
few
years
berkshire

company
bbc
beers
are
all
ill
drink
when
im
in
pittsfield
for
8
bucks
or
so
with
a
1
50
deposit
on
a
64oz
growler
this
ipa
cant
be
beat
except
maybe
by
one
of
their
others
beers
available
locally
this
beer
pours
out
cloudy
and
yellow
with
a
hoppy
and
herbal
scent
and
a
taste
to
match
exceptionally
well
made
and
my
favorite
english
style
ipa
drink
local
served
in
a
traditional
pint
glass
this
poured
a
cloudy
dark
orange
with
a
onefinger
offwhite
head
and
exceptional
lacing
the
nose
is
citrus
grapefruit
and
pineapple
and
floral
hops
but
also
some
sweeter
fruits
like
peach
and
sweet
caramel
malts
the
latter
is
there
in
the
taste
along
with
the
expected
pine
and
citrus
this
is
a
familiar
combination
but
the
total
is
not
like
most
other
ipas
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
medium
and
smooth
carbonation
was
moderate
to
light
and
the
aftertaste
was
not
overly
bitter
the
hops
here
are
overcome
with
the
sweetness
not
an
alltime
favorite
but
this
was
nice
and
at
5
5
abv
would
be
quite
sessionable
good
drinkability
solid
ipa
even
keeled
from
notes
dnot
enough
pop
in
the
taste
department
for
me
to
want
more
than
one
overall
i
think
weve
become
accustomed
to
drinking
these
huge
ipas
that
we
forget
with
a
subtle
but
essential
use
of
hops
tastes
like
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
hop
bite
but
this
one
is
just
right
not
something
that
i
think
stands
up
to
food
well
but
a
refreshing
brew
overall
very
worthy
d
easy
to
drink
low
abv
simple
good
stuff
a
few
of
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
dangerous
for
my
enjoyment
of
a
beer
the
sweet
malt
the
straight
bitterness
the
herbal
and
pine
hops
without
any
citrus
but
they
never
get
out
of
line
here
more
to
the
point
they
never
stop
complimenting
each
other
and
everything
else
in
the
flavor
another
subtle
wellbalanced
beautifully
crafted
beer
from
berkshire
brewing
company
for
a
low
price
i
dont
have
alot
of
experience
with
englishstyle
ipas
but
this
is
great
stuff
those
expecting
an
american
hop
bomb
may
be
disappointed
but
those
who
appreciate
an
easydrinking
wellbalanced
ipa
should
really
pick
this
up
notes
i
love
how
the
carmelly
malt
sweetness
holds
up
against
the
bitter
hops
it
strikes
a
really
great
balance
i
think
this
is
very
drinkable
very
good
d
extremely
drinkable
at
just
5
5
i
could
easily
down
a
few
pints
of
this
delicious
22oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
pours
a
medium
goldenyellow
with
a
large
fluffy
head
almost
no
smell
but
an
extremely
faint
hint
of
hops
taste
is
comparable
to
a
light
adjunct
beer
with
a
little
bit
more
pronounced
hop
flavor
almost
entirely
flavorless
very
watery
and
onedimensional
the
hops
that
are
present
are
faintly
medicinal
tasting
and
the
body
of
the
beer
seems
to
be
nonexistant
except
perhaps
a
small
amount
of
very
light
grain
andor
adjuncts
mouthfeel
is
almost
nothing
it
is
lightly
carbonated
even
for
a
smoother
beer
very
drinkable
but
not
enjoyable
d
very
drinkable
well
blended
taste
and
feeling
with
a
moderate
abv
which
is
nice
wow
this
was
really
good
on
the
nitro
draft
served
with
a
thick
creamy
off
white
head
and
lots
of
lace
color
was
a
clear
medium
amber
aroma
was
malt
roasty
toffee
and
hoppy
flavor
was
excellent
and
perfectly
balanced
for
the
style
malt
to
hop
and
like
aroma
killer
body
and
carbonation
the
bitter
to
sweet
ration
leaned
ever
so
slightly
sweet
and
left
me
wishing
i
could
get
this
when
i
got
home
d
a
great
ipa
that
really
surprised
me
taste
is
hoppy
but
not
in
your
face
easy
drinking
and
smooth
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
crisp
with
a
good
malty
backbone
carbonation
is
light
perfest
for
an
english
ipa
d
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
makes
you
wish
it
were
socially
acceptable
to
refuse
to
share
a
growler
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
any
day
of
the
year
d
this
was
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
ipa
the
balance
on
it
makes
it
a
nice
nonhop
bomb
drinker
that
i
will
be
sure
to
get
again
and
again
when
i
can
d
after
the
first
glass
i
was
resigned
that
the
beer
is
generally
solid
worth
a
few
repeat
visits
should
i
have
the
chance
after
the
second
glass
i
am
inclined
to
say
this
beer
would
be
in
regular
rotation
as
a
slightlymorethanoccasional
treat
were
it
readily
available
d
incredibly
smooth
and
perfectly
balanced
ipa
and
one
that
i
would
happily
enjoy
a
few
of
at
a
time
one
of
my
favorites
d
this
is
a
nice
ipa
on
a
warm
day
fruity
and
sweet
the
feel
is
pretty
smooth
goes
down
well
with
a
nice
medium
body
it
is
a
bitter
sob
but
is
a
really
enjoyable
ipa
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
it
was
a
very
good
english
style
ipa
it
had
some
very
good
flavors
and
was
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
overall
d
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
i
would
suggest
this
beer
to
someone
that
does
not
necessarily
like
ipas
it
has
great
fruit
flavor
and
goes
down
smooth
one
of
those
beers
i
never
buy
at
the
beer
store
yet
always
seem
to
be
drinking
when
i
go
out
the
aroma
was
distinctly
hoppy
the
taste
was
a
balanced
blend
of
hoppy
and
malty
i
was
expecting
a
hoppier
beer
i
suppose
i
was
expecting
an
american
ipa
still
this
is
a
well
brewed
balanced
beer
i
think
i
would
like
it

could
pair
with
many
light
dishes
as
well
as
some
heavier
fare
think
fried
food
but
may
be
over
powered

could
put
down

at

thought
will
buy
again
thanks
to
shaebs99
for
this
excellent
bonus
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
orangeamber
with
a
decent
head
that
lasted
ok
but
didnt
lace
very
well
the
aroma
was
surprisingly
malty
sweet
for
an
ipa
with
only
a
subtle
hint
of
hop
bitterness
or
citrus
the
taste
had
a
little
more
lemonorange
essence
but
the
finish
fell
flat
the
body
was
much
thinner
than
expected
like
the
steel
rail
pale
ale
i
wouldnt
session
this
beer
due
to
lack
of
flavor
d
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
refreshing
brew
d
decent
enough
but
tastes
sort
of
off
maybe
an
old
bottle
i
couldnt
find
the
best
before
date
even
though
i
know
bbc
dates
their
stuff
hmmm
a
bit
darker
than
most
ipas
which
is
just
fine
nice
little
bite
of
bitter
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
a
slightly
fruit
finish
with
apples
coming
through
very
clearly
especially
in
the
aftertaste
superbly
session
able
though
as
this
was
a
very
easy
drinker
and
i
could
have
thrown
this
one
down
all
night
long
to
be
honest
out
of
a
22
oz
bottle
poured
into
my
bbc
pint
glass
this
pours
a
hazy
golden
amber
color
with
a
really
nice
think
head
on
it
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
look
at
brewed
locally
in
south
deerfield
ma
make
sure
you
get
it
at
a
store
that
sells
it
regularly
it
must
be
enjoyed
as
fresh
as
possible
theres
really
no
buffer
zone
at
1st
taste
it
really
warms
you
then
the
hop
finish
comes
through
and
bites
you
i
would
say
it
is
more
piney
than
citrus
fitting
for
a
beer
made
for
the
berkshire
mountain
folk
overall
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
and
i
love
supporting
the
local
business
so
it
works
on
all
levels
bbc
lost

goes
best

if
youre
a

of
those
you
will
definitely
be
a
fan
of

share
some
with
your
four
legged
friend
for
good
measure
i
hate
to
bag
on
this
if
it
is
old
and
i
know
the
english
style
doesnt
pride
itself
on
strong
citrus
or
pine
hop
flavors
this
is
a
good
beer
just
not
memorable
at
all

to

overall
although
extremely
average
in
the
mouthfeel
department
the

was
quite
nice
but
the

could
benefit
from
the
addition
of
more

which
would
work
nicely
with
the

of
this

a
very

probably
my

smells

tastes

mainly
lemon
pale

a
touch

sweet

earthy

this
ale
is
certainly
medium
bodied
and
amply
carbonated
for
its
style
this
bomber
was
drained
rather
quickly
and
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
this
one
again
d
a
decent
ipa
easy
enough
to
drink
but
not
all
that
compelling
final
thoughts
this
was
the
first
beer
i
tried
from
bbc
awesome
choice
as
it
clearly
is
their
best
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
taste
initially
seemed
a
bit
watered
down
flavors
dont
seem
to
blend
well
the
malt
and
the
hops
seem
to
collide
rather
than
play
nicely
together
the
hop
lingers
around
the
edges
of
the
mouth
kinda
crisp
overall
but
soft
on
the
tongue
while
not
the
greatest
mouthfeel
still
able
to
drink
a
decent
amount
of
it
interesting
but
i
do
not
remember
having
a
beer
with
a
nice
aroma
that
gets
intrusive
so
fast
this
is
a
hopforward
citrusy
ipa
thats
not
too
inyourface
so
it
stays
fairly
drinkable
there
is
a
bit
of
abrasiveness
to
the
hops
in
the
finish
that
keeps
it
from
being
super
drinkable
overall
a
decent
ipa
im
not
a
fan
of
ipas
let
alone
those
that
are
dryhopped
but
i
had
to
grab
a
log
of
this
on
short
notice
as
far
as
hoppy
beers
go
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
easiest
to
drink
its
nice
because
its
not
quite
as
dry
or
bitter
as
some
other
hoppy
beers
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
for
those
ipa
lovers
id
certainly
suggest
picking
it
up
this
beer
makes
you
wish
more
breweries
had
the
guts
to
make
an
ipa
that
didnt
rely
on
bushels
upon
bushels
of
hops
this
is
one
of
the
original
india
pales
that
got
me
interested
in
the
style
lets
see
how
it
turns
out
having
not
had
it
for
some
time
poured
in
to
a
traditional
english
pint
glass
a
hazy
orange
with
a
bit
more
than
a
ring
of
white
lacing
smell
is
of
grapefruit
and
light
delicate
hops
that
give
off
various
citrus
aromas
slightly
metallic
smell
and
a
smell
that
reminds
me
of
ringwood
yeast
hit
of
honey
oriented
malt
in
the
beginning
followed
by
light
floral
hops
it
leaves
a
mild
numbing
effect
on
the
palate
this
beer
has
a
very
complex
hop
profile
but
not
in
your
face
or
over
the
top
like
so
many
others
feel
of
this
beer
is
really
well
rounded
out
not
too
big
but
not
too
light
drinking
this
is
helped
out
immensely
by
the
balance
of
malt
and
hops
as
it
has
been
said
before
this
is
one
of
the
best
for
its
style
that
new
england
has
to
offer
it
is
a
pity
that
there
arent
so
many
english
varieties
of
this
style
more
widely
available
as
i
think
they
are
every
bit
as
complex
and
good
as
their
american
counterparts
i
will
make
sure
to
include
this
as
an
extra
in
trades
i
make
in
the
future
cheers
and
happy
st
pattys
day
d
a
nice
english
ipa
with
a
strong
fugglesgoldings
influence
but
clearly
care
in
malting
was
present
which
speaks
well
of
the
first
berkshire
offering
ive
had
the
chance
to
try
doesnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
its
a
solid
nice
drinking
delicious
ipa
d
i
consider
this
high
in
drinkability
w
fresh
hop
yeast
flavors
great
balance
and
high
on
the
quaffability
scale
for
an
english
ipa
and
fits
the
style
well
overall
this
is
an
aboveaverage
ipa
though
i
think
it
could
be
better
with
more
malt
flavor
still
certainly
worth
a
shot
d
at
this
abv
and
classic
flavors
so
well
balanced
a
session
for
sure
this
beer
poured
an
deep
orange
amber
slightly
hazy
2
finger
foamy
white
head
with
nice
thick
sticky
lacing
nose
is
of
malts
caramel
balanced
with
some
nice
hops
notes
and
bit
of
spice
taste
is
of
hops
with
great
balanced
backbone
of
malt
i
am
quite
impressed
by
the
balance
of
this
beer
definitely
makes
you
want
to
come
back
for
more
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
very
smooth
going
down
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
great
ipa
that
i
could
definitely
sit
with
for
a
session
thanks
to
reagan1984
for
throwing
this
in
on
a
recent
trade
straight
from
the
bomber
to
pint
this
pours
a
light
orangeamber
color
with
frothy
offwhite
one
finger
head
there
is
a
definite
hop
character
to
the
smell
with
a
tart
citrus
background
the
taste
follows
this
trend
as
there
is
a
nice
citrus
background
to
the
bitter
hops
the
hops
do
not
overwhelm
due
to
a
nice
balance
with
the
malt
it
is
a
really
smooth
easy
drinking
ipa
with
no
overbearing
carbonation
either
i
really
like
this
ipa
a
citrusy
hops
character
balanced
with
a
sound
malt
backbone
and
no
overdone
carbonation
i
wish
i
lived
in
new
england
i
could
see
me
drinking
many
of
these
this
spring
if
i
did
have
i
said
fresh
you
can
really
tell
this
beer
is
different
from
others
all
around
the
ipa
i
would
reach
for
in
a
session
cheers
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
some
carbonation
wow
this
is
one
of
the
better
ipas
ive
had
recently
and
pure
drinkability
in
terms
of
finishing
the
glass
in
front
of
me
was
amazing
i
could
easily
session
a
few
bombers
and
i
rarely
say
that
about
any
brew
mouthfeel
and
flavor
were
brilliant
leaving
me
craving
more
if
i
have
the
opportunity
to
get
a
few
more
bottles
i
will
in
a
heartbeat
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
ipa
that
is
hoppy
malty
yet
refined
and
balanced
the
smoothness
in
the
profile
really
makes
this
a
standout
ipa
excellent
job
i
got
this
beer
in
the
12
gallon
gowler
fresh
from
the
brewery
slightly
hazy
light
to
mediumamber
color
big
creamcolored
velvety
draftlike
head
wonderfully
fresh
hoppy
and
cottoncandydextriney
nose
slight
pine
and
citrus
peel
notes
with
the
hops
smooth
mediumbodied
mouth
feel
very
natural
and
draftlike
fresh
very
wellbalanced
and
long
flavor
delicious
incredibly
complex
as
opposed
to
simply
powerful
hoppy
tones
nicely
balanced
w
caramel
and
butterscotch
toasted
maltiness
to
provide
good
counterbalance
to
the
hoppiness
a
rather
lightly
toasted
and
hoppy
ipa
though
bodisome
and
full
this
is
a
great
savory
sophisticated
ipa
although
the
bottled
version
is
good
its
definitely
worth
getting
the
growler
great
drinkability
proud
to
be
a
local
another
great
offering
from
bbc
cheers
drinkability
solidly
drinkable
and
really
low
in
alcohol
making
it
very
sessionable
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
though
its
not
a
style
ive
partaken
too
much
in
the
hop
profile
on
this
one
was
very
unique
and
perhaps
with
a
few
more
complexities
thrown
in
this
one
would
be
a
big
big
winner
this
is
a
very
good
beer
there
is
just
the
right
balance
of
hopiness
drinkablity
and
finish
in
this
beer
the
brewers
at
bbc
really
know
what
they
are
doing
i
have
made
the
trip
to
the
brewery
for
the
tour
twice
now
this
is
one
of
there
better
beers
picked
up
a
22oz
bottle
but
then
again
all
i
see
bbc
beers
in
are
22oz
bottles
poured
into
a
guinness
pint
glass
the
color
is
a
very
light
copper
leaves
a
head
thats
about
a
finger
thick
and
has
pretty
good
retention
a
different
smell
for
an
ipa
more
malty
than
hoppy
has
some
hint
of
citrus
as
well
the
hops
are
there
but
they
are
hidden
a
bit
by
the
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
well
balanced
but
as
with
the
aroma
its
more
malt
than
hops
its
a
sweet
taste
caramel
and
a
noticable
bitterness
to
it
it
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
stickiness
in
the
mouth
light
to
medium
bodied
and
it
drinks
easy
ive
had
this
before
and
i
will
have
it
again
tried
this
ipa
from
a
22oz
bomber
great
head
formation
with
good
lacing
during
session
initial
notes
are
citrus
and
malt
finishes
most
triumphantly
to
a
great
light
floral
hop
character
bbc
is
a
brewery
that
puts
out
great
tasting
beer

are
lucky
to
have
them
around
d
this
is
a

of
pine
and
citrus
has
a
taste
of
pine
and
a
little
citrus
hard
to
make
out
not
bitter
at
all
and
does
not
have
an
overpowering
taste
to
it
has
a
high
drinkability
to
it
though
due
to
the
lightness
of
it
definitely
not
the
best
ipa
but
an
allright
one
had
a
pint
tonight
at
woodys
paired
well
with
a
pizza
with
some
spicy
toppings
slight
orange
color
decent
white
head
mild
carbonation
spicy
smell
of
pine
plenty
of
hops
in
the
taste
a
bit
lighter
in
the
mouthfeel
than
other
ipas
a
pretty
good
ipa
didnt
blow
me
away
not
something
i
want
to
drink
all
night
but
if
you
like
hops
this
will
more
than
satisfy
an
above
average
ipa
right
here
ive
had
better
but
ive
had
many
that
were
worse
it
is
pretty
damn
hoppy
but
the
taste
could
be
improved
a
tad
its
all
blended
together
well
and
is
a
well
balanced
beer
and
id
like
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
d
this
is
a
really
drinkable
brew
although
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
the
look
aroma
and
taste
make
up
for
it
the
thinness
makes
it
go
down
easy
and
makes
it
very
drinkable
the
abv
is
light
and
doesnt
really
rear
its
head
pretty
good
beer
notes
a
killer
eipa
in
terms
of
drinkability
thanks
to
drdogbeer
for
the
extra
this
is
a
great
extremely
easy
drinker
that
id
be
happy
to
have
access
to
makes
me
wanna
try
more
berkshire
brews
pours
a
yellow
amber
golden
with
a
lively
head
that
collapses
to
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
sickly
sweet
the
flavor
is
light
and
malty
but
a
bit
out
of
balance
piney
hops
give
it
an
odd
resiny
sweet
quality
slight
bitterness
and
resiny
feel
on
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
thin
this
is
an
ok
ipa
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
the
way
for
it
improves
as
it
warms
becoming
a
light
and
reasonably
balanced
ale
though
still
light
on
the
hops
even
by
english
style
standards
thanks
tprokop7
mouthfeel
is
a
smooth
medium
body
and
it
drinks
very
easily
very
nice
english
ipa
and
a
great
alternative
to
the
many
hoppier
ipas
for
nonhop
heads
overallwell
balanced
ipa
hop
heads
will
hate
it
but
i
do
appreciate
that
its
an
approachable
and
drinkable
version
of
this
ever
more
extreme
style
tasted
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
while
it
was
a
tad
watered
down
to
me
it
was
not
bad
for
the
style
i
will
stick
to
my
american
ipas
and
their
hop
profiles
i
am
a
hophead
for
sure
but
his
beer
is
not
bad
at
all
just
not
my
style
if
youre
a
hop
freak
you
should
look
elsewhere
if
you
enjoy
a
bit
sweeter
milder
ipa
give
it
a
shot
lost
sailor
makes
for
a
great
session
ipa
and
something
interesting
to
pack
for
camping
or
a
bbq
when
you
dont
want
lots
of
bottles
and
cans
around
plus
it
doubles
as
a
musical
instrument
when
youre
done
d
quite
good
quaffable
and
tasty
the
lack
of
hop
bite
makes
it
easier
to
put
back
overall
this
was
a
decent
ipa
very
session
able
with
an
interesting
little
twist
of
the
flavor
i
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
and
see
if
it
comes
off
a
touch
fresher
definitely
solid
though
and
has
not
tarnished
my
opinion
of
berkshire
in
the
slightest
d
notes
good
sessionability
moderate
bitterness
clearly
makes
this
an
english
ipa
d
very
sessionable
ipa
one
of
the
best
for
this
category
d
i
consider
this
a
very
dignified
ipa
that
doesnt
punish
the
drinker
at
a
modest
5
5
i
personally
appreciate
this
and
i
think
this
beer
is
full
of
character
its
nice
to
drink
an
ipa
bomber
to
myself
and
not
feel
irreparably
impaired
with
a
scorched
tongue
dont
get
me
wrong
sometimes
i
crave
these
ipas
its
just
nice
to
see
some
diversity
very
nice
if
this
brew
were
available
locally
id
definitely
pick
one
up
now
then
i
also
think
it
would
be
a
stellar
beer
to
use
to
introduce
someone
to
the
gentler
kinder
side
of
wellmade
beers
now
im
looking
forward
the
bbc
raspberry
barleywine
that
was
resting
next
to
it
22
oz
bottle
with
no
visible
freshness
date
unfiltered
and
unpasteurized
it
pours
a
lightlyhazy
dark
amber
color
with
medium
carbonation
topped
with
a
threefinger
light
tan
head
that
deposits
a
good
amount
of
lace
nice
and
hoppy
in
the
nose
with
notes
of
citrus
pine
aspirin
and
a
bit
of
earthiness
on
the
palate
it
is
all
this
plus
leafy
and
fruity
hops
tasty
grapefruit
a
medium
bitterness
and
some
sweet
and
buttery
flavors
from
the
malts
the
beer
is
medium
in
carbonation
and
body
with
a
dry
hoppy
finish
all
in
all
this
is
a
tasty
easytodrink
ipa
that
has
a
flavorful
and
complex
hop
profile
pours
a
light
orange
amber
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
the
smell
is
subtle
with
an
understated
hop
scent
about
it
the
taste
is
of
mild
floral
hops
with
a
slight
bitterness
it
has
a
good
balance
and
the
hoppiness
is
not
as
powerful
as
in
other
ipas
is
very
drinkable
and
is
especially
good
for
those
who
dont
like
the
strong
hop
flavor
usually
present
in
ipas
milky
smooth
feel
mild
film
leaves
a
bitter
aftertaste
a
good
thing
either
an
american
esb
or
a
british
ipa
really
drinkable
and
nice
a
hoppy
paleish
ale
with
some
distinction
drinkability
is
very
good
this
a
great
ipa
and
one
of
the
best
ipas
that
i
have
tasted
coming
out
of
mass
the
second
beer
i
have
tasted
from
berkshire
brewing
and
i
am
very
pleased
a
pretty
good
ipa
in
my
book
this
is
a
good
ipa
but
not
spectacular
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
some
head
lacing
retention
this
is
quite
a
mild
ipa
not
bursting
with
hoppiness
perhaps
a
bit
of
nutty
flavors
some
grapefruit
sweet
malts
and
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
mild
enough
and
thus
highly
drinkable
lchaim
so
i
dinged
this
beer
a
bit
for
not
being
quite
to
style
even
for
an
english
ipa
but
that
being
said
in
and
of
itself
a
fantastic
beer
its
one
of
the
most
interesting
ive
had
in
quite
a
while
i
wish
i
had
a
case
of
this
stuff
really
really
great
pours
a
cloudy
orange
gold
color
nice
creamy
head
leaves
nice
lacin
nice
piney
hop
aroma
not
overwhelming
taste
is
very
smooth
for
an
ipa
good
hop
flavor
and
slight
bite
but
balanced
very
well
with
the
malts
so
it
goes
down
and
finishes
very
easy
great
flavor
and
superb
drinkability
i
wnjoyed
it
more
as
i
drank
on
smell
was
mildly
hoppy
with
tons
of
big
malt
aromas
smells
a
little
bit
grainy
a
bit
of
citrus
was
noticed
deep
in
the
background
taste
was
almost
identical
to
the
smell
big
malt
backbone
on
this
one
with
a
medium
hop
flavor
more
graininess
pretty
well
balanced
in
my
opinion
not
too
bad
had
a
nice
smooth
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
that
was
pretty
clean
and
crisp
just
enough
carbonation
to
tickle
the
tongue
great
drinkability
and
very
refreshing
a
pretty
good
english
i
p
a
from
berkshire
brewing
d
a
real
sessioner
this
beer
has
a
nice
onetwo
punch
of
malt
and
hops
pours
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
aroma
is
of
hops
and
malt
with
the
hops
showing
through
quite
well
taste
is
mostly
bready
with
a
very
subdued
bitterness
aftertaste
is
biscuity
and
buttery
smooth
its
very
much
like
an
english
ipa
with
the
malt
showing
through
more
theres
a
decent
fruitiness
upfront
as
well
not
too
bad
not
quite
what
id
find
to
be
impressive
though
a
cloudy
tea
colored
brew
with
solid
light
tan
head
and
good
fluffy
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
mild
malt
and
apple
blend
with
a
curious
nutty
presence
in
the
background
the
first
taste
gets
a
tingly
carbonation
thats
bready
with
a
lemon
background
nice
body
feel
with
a
hint
of
malt
throughout
an
easy
drinking
middle
ground
ipa
with
only
minor
hops
but
a
pleasant
overall
outcome
a
mild
choice
that
should
be
acceptable
to
most
ale
fans
recommended
for
a
try
and
better
i
think
than
the
bottled
version
i
had
earlier
having
this
one
in
another
one
of
their
great
pint
bottles
its
appearance
is
golden
and
murky
heavy
creamy
head
appeared
after
the
pour
the
expected
smells
of
citrus
are
there
but
surprisingly
they
seem
restrained
comparatively
sure
i
have
here
some
great
hop
smell
but
it
was
fainter
and
less
potent
than
i
would
expect
its
taste
makes
up
for
it
by
having
its
usual
great
bitter
punch
on
the
taste
buds
a
great
carbonation
keeps
this
drink
alive
and
crisp
after
a
long
period
of
time
overall
not
the
best
ipa
but
pretty
good
in
taste
this
was
my
first
berkshire
beer
and
color
me
impressed
true
to
style
and
very
drinkable
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
these
guys
soon
pours
a
hazy
dark
golden
color
nice
carbonation
nice
small
creamy
offwhite
head
some
nice
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
hoppy
nice
blend
of
citrus
and
pines
and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
very
hoppy
slight
sweetness
good
dose
of
citruspines
and
some
caramel
there
is
a
nice
chewiness
to
this
brew
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
my
third
berkshire
so
far
so
good
very
tasty
brews
impressed
very
nice
to
drink
very
refreshing
a
very
good
beer
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
full
rich
golden
with
an
almost
creamylike
head
atop
settling
into
a
white
froth
leaving
broken
globs
of
lace
behind
as
it
settled
slowly
not
a
real
big
hop
element
in
the
nose
somewhat
leafy
and
citric
with
a
little
caramel
and
juicy
malt
fruit
for
sure
an
english
interpretation
mild
hop
flavors
leafy
and
herbal
with
a
tinge
of
citrusa
big
sweetish
caramel
biscuit
base
goes
toe
to
toe
with
the
hops
making
it
more
of
a
balanced
ipa
eh
its
ok
not
remarkable
but
drinkable
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
judging
by
the
taste
it
seems
to
me
that
this
beer
should
be
listed
as
an
english
ipa
rather
than
an
american
ipa
however
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
the
flavor
is
mild
overall
with
some
caramel
hitting
my
lips
and
then
flowing
to
some
slightly
bitter
sappy
hops
but
finishes
back
with
malt
and
a
grainy
flavor
there
is
no
hint
of
abv
and
the
beer
goes
down
very
easily
i
think
this
is
a
nice
example
of
an
ipa
that
isnt
hopped
out
to
the
extreme
and
maintains
drinkability
and
balance
a
nice
beer
from
a
good
brewery
my
only
complaint
is
the
overly
mild
carb
and
thin
body
still
a
lovely
sessionable
ipa
at
only
5
5
not
really
a
hop
fix
for
a
hophead
but
definitely
a
quality
beer
a
well
crafted
beer
and
very
enjoyable
when
i
want
a
real
hop
fix
i
can
just
look
to
the
many
dipas
available
but
feel
that
a
traditional
ipa
should
not
have
overpowering
hop
character
very
drinkable
i
will
be
immensely
pleased
when
berkshire
is
distributed
to
ny
ive
had
it
on
tap
and
from
a
22
oz
bottle
and
prefer
the
tap
version
pairs
well
with
food
when
ive
tasted
it
bbc
beer
dinners
mouthfeel
average
nothing
really
stands
out
carbonation
is
light
finish
is
slightly
bitter
but
ends
cleanly
a
relatively
drinkable
beer
but
not
enough
flavor
to
make
it
really
enjoyable

must
be
appreciated
well
done

quite
inviting
the
flavors

balance
each

a
bouquet
of
floral
and
leafy
hops
hit
the
tongue
open
up
into
a
bit
of
fruity
yeast
and
the
whole
thing
finishes
like
challah
sweet
eggy
bread
this
is
as
comfort
beer
as
ipa
gets
in
my
opinion
ok
and
very
drinkable
true
to
style
i
like
my
ipas
with
more
hops
but
that
is
a
personal
thing
this
is
a
great
brew
for
the
summer
and
for
someone
like
me
who
isnt
too
familiar
with
ipas
i
enjoyed
it

predominately
floral
aroma

22oz
bomber
bottle
pours
into
the
glass
a
hazy
orange
smells
sweet
and
floral
taste
is
on
the
sweet
side
for
an
ipa
but
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
aromas
are
from
both
the
malt
and
hops
the
hop
flavors
contain
citrus
notes
of
orange
and
grapefruit
which
is
similar
to
other
ipas
only
they
do
not
dominate
the
flavor
profile
like
an
american
style
ipa
there
is
certainly
enough
hop
flavor
and
aroma
to
keep
the
drinker
interested
but
the
hops
blend
more
than
showcase
this
is
a
beer
and
a
brewery
that
i
visit
and
revisit
often
berkshire
never
dissappoints
as
their
beers
are
complex
and
balanced
i
absolutely
love
the
berkshires
but
the
native
beer
not
so
much
at
least
this
one
it
seems
whats
not
thin
is
almost
cacophonous
and
out
of
place
you
can
tell
it
wants
to
be
a
solid
ipa
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
know
the
way
drinking
is
by
no
means
a
chore
but
it
doesnt
bring
a
lot
of
joy
either
im
not
so
sure
this
sailor
is
actually
lost
i
think
maybe
hes
hiding
pours
with
a
marmalade
color
and
a
bright
white
tightbubbled
long
lasting
head
the
nose
is
quite
hoppy
but
typical
to
the
english
style
and
not
the
american
earthy
notes
instead
of
citrus
grass
instead
of
metals
etc
along
with
a
toasted
biscuity
malt
backing
subdued
and
very
nice
on
the
palate
pale
malt
sweetness
first
off
which
lasts
through
the
midpalate
some
lightly
citric
and
spicy
hop
oils
crop
up
next
to
growing
tealike
bitterness
the
finish
has
some
marshmallowlike
sweetness
but
its
not
overly
sweet
as
finishes
go
mouthfeel
is
only
medium
in
thickness
and
pretty
light
in
carbonation
that
makes
the
beer
sit
a
little
heavier
on
the
palate
than
it
should
but
its
such
a
light
beer
that
it
ends
up
not
mattering
much
overall
a
very
good
pretty
mild
extremely
drinkable
ipa
in
the
english
style
probably
my
favorite
bbc
beer
so
far
this
is
a
fine
ipa
which
could
go
up
against
the
best
i
dont
think
it
has
dislodged
my
favorite
stone
but
it
comes
awfully
close
i
like
this
ipa
above
average
and
i
would
have
again
because
of
the
freshness
rating
so
smooth
and
creamy
could
just
sit
here
and
drink
bomber
after
bomber
as
easy
drinking
as
can
be
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
more
of
this
delicious
brew
this
one
didnt
wow
me
in
any
areas
and
aside
from
a
fairly
blah
appearance
actually
did
a
fairly
decent
job
with
the
style
id
have
it
again
no
problem
its
just
not
overly
memorable
thinner
medium
body
good
carbonation
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
an
enjoyable
beer
but
pretty
average
22

it
is
time
to
review
this
brew
beige

2
finger

which
sticks
around
for
awhile
smells

very

is

fever
good
to
see
that
they
got
some
ink
in
the
boston
globe
the
other
day
it
can
be
read
at
boston
com
just
type
berkshire
brewery
good
stuff
this
poured
with
a
big
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
there
was
a
lot
of
floating
particulate
in
this
honeygoldenyellow
colored
beer
with
a
viscous
appearance
the
nose
had
a
lightly
hoppy
presence
the
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
thin
which
was
unexpected
given
its
appearance
in
the
glass
the
taste
was
only
lightly
hoppy
and
kind
of
disappointing
the
finish
had
a
floral
quality
but
still
tended
more
towards
sweet
ive
had
better
beers
from
bbw
this
is
my
goto
beer
these
days
the
hop
aroma
indicates
a
lovely
dryhopping
that
exudes
real
character
the
hop
bitterness
is
there
but
nicely
balanced
with
an
underlying
malt
backbone
in
the
glass
the
creamy
head
holds
up
and
leaves
lace
all
down
the
side
this
is
one
wellbalanced
tasty
brew
that
never
seems
to
disappoint
d
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
way
this
beer
tasted
as
the
hops
were
present
but
subdued
in
a
good
way
that
made
it
easy
to
drink
along
with
the
creamy
and
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
good
stuff
this
is
one
of
the
better
english
style
ipas
that
ive
tasted
pours
a
light
orange
yellow
with
a
giant
white
foamy
head
the
color
is
lighter
than
most
ipas
the
smell
has
a
bread
yeast
and
hop
citrus
aroma
to
itbut
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
the
taste
is
bisquity
and
some
citrus
hopsnot
as
strong
as
american
ipasbut
a
nice
smooth
english
version
a
very
good
tasting
beer
the
mf
is
light
and
the
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
an
excellant
english
ipa
that
should
not
be
missed
cheers
overall
a
very
drinkable
eipa
an
excellent
session
beer
would
love
to
try
this
beer
on
tap
da
oooooh
easily
drinkable
and
rather
enjoyable
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
as
with
all
of
berkshire
beers
it
tastes
fresh
and
crisp
i
have
not
been
disappointed
by
a
berkshire
brewing
product
and
this
is
no
exception
pours
an
opaque
orange
amber
color
with
a
finely
textured
tan
head
hoppy
aroma
with
fruity
overtones
is
inviting
mouthfeel
is
lush
and
creamy
nicely
balanced
maltiness
blends
with
the
herbal
hoppiness
not
a
particularly
aggressive
ipa
this
one
is
more
about
maintaining
a
nice
balance
with
the
maltiness
and
it
succeeds
quite
well
a
solid
easy
drinking
offering
d
this
one
goes
down
very
easy
not
filling
at
all
either
its
a
beer
wellworth
pounding
22oz
bottle
purchased
from
charles
street
liquors
in
boston
the
bottle
was
unrefrigerated
although
berkshires
website
says
that
all
of
their
products
must
be
refrigerated
pours
a
lovely
cloudy
gold
not
much
in
the
way
of
head
or
lacing
medium
aroma
of
hops
first
taste
is
very
pleasing
and
fills
the
mouth
with
fullness
wellbalanced
hoppy
and
fruity
taste
a
pleasure
to
drink
pours
out
a
hazy
dark
orangy
amber
color
nice
clean
thick
white
head
and
great
lacing
of
the
pint
glass
smells
very
floral
and
sweet
nice
strong
citrusy
hop
smell
make
for
the
great
aromas
from
this
ipa
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
before
but
never
had
the
opportunity
to
write
a
review
i
have
enjoyed
it
on
tap
from
a
22oz
and
from
a
growler
but
the
smell
coloration
and
well
rounded
flavors
hold
true
anyway
it
is
served
nice
smooth
flavor
mild
hop
flavor
at
first
followed
by
a
nice
strong
bittering
aftertaste
great
hop
flavor
and
suttle
malt
sweetness
not
an
extreemly
heavy
ipa
but
it
has
nice
body
and
great
overall
ipa
characteristics
extreemly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
great
tasting
brew
that
keeps
getting
beter
with
each
sip
i
look
forward
to
having
this
beer
wherever
it
is
avaliable
bbc
has
made
a
great
ipa
that
will
be
right
on
top
of
my
favorite
list
way
to
brew
another
winner
in
my
book
this
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
an
everlasting
head
lemons
and
grapes
dominant
the
nose
the
taste
has
floral
hops
with
a
well
balanced
almost
fruity
malt
backbone
albeit
made
in
the
good
ole
u
s
of
a
this
is
definitely
a
british
style
ipa
this
was
refreshing
after
my
usually
intake
of
copius
west
coast
hop
bombs
the
british
are
more
subtle
than
us
loud
asshole
americans
arent
they
fuckin
cappys
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
was
what
i
like
in
an
ipa
flavorful
and
very
easy
to
quaff
this
beer
was
very
fresh
on
tap
which
let
its
flavors
shine
through
try
some
of
this
hazy
gold
with
a
frothy
white
head
tons
of
lace
with
good
head
retention
really
the
lacing
is
pretty
awesome
im
impressed
very
floral
aroma
is
this
one
madedry
hopped
with
noble
hops
tettnang
very
unusual
nicely
balanced
pale
malt
maintaining
a
presence
with
some
cereal
sweetness
taking
a
sip
its
real
real
mellow
like
any
good
session
ale
should
be
probably
a
bit
too
warm
feels
warm
on
a
midsummer
evening
but
still
nice
pale
malt
sweetness
with
a
grapenuts
cereal
graininess
and
a
little
dab
of
caramel
soft
pear
fruitiness
starting
to
dry
out
early
modestly
hopped
finish
floral
and
citrusy
ending
off
incredibly
dry
almost
puckering
not
sour
just
super
duper
dry
full
bodied
with
nearly
flat
carbonation
in
the
true
english
style
the
difference
between
this
beer
and
the
regular
tapbottle
is
night
and
day
completely
different
hop
feel
unique
unusual
and
pretty
damn
tasty
hey
i
went
for
thirds
if
that
says
anything
great
english
styled
ipa
an
overall
good
ipa
nice
citrus
aroma
with
very
good
mouthfeel
nice
dark
amber
color
with
no
sediment
when
poured
unbeleivable
creamy
head
more
so
than
any
other
beer
i
have
had
in
the
last
year
so
much
i
scooped
some
out
with
a
spoon
and
ate
it
like
ice
cream
mmmm
mmm
good
cheers
cheers
i
enjoyed
berkshire
coffeehouse
porter
and
im
enjoying
lost
sailor
ipa
as
well
i
hadnt
heard
a
whole
lot
about
these
guys
and
hadnt
been
able
to
sample
their
wares
prior
to
my
recent
trade
with
muddyfeet
but
on
the
evidence
of
these
two
fine
ales
theyre
a
brewery
to
be
reckoned
with
the
body
is
decent
crisp
and
drinkable
nice
bite
very
drinkable
if
only
i
could
get
something
like
this
around
here
where
intensely
fruity
ipas
are
the
standard
drinkability
i
could
have
many
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
i
would
gladly
keep
this
in
my
fridge
for
casual
drinking
experiences
it
is
probably
my
favorite
ipa
to
date
d
low
not
very
impressed
my
buddy
and
i
actually
poured
it
out
m
d
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
on
this
offering
from
berkshire
are
both
high
nice
and
smooth
drinking
ipa
good
carbonation
with
a
nice
sweet
aftertaste
creamy
up
front
but
slick
when
it
goes
down
one
of
the
better
ipas
from
new
england
region
ive
had
recently
no
complaints
here
as
i
had
three
of
them
beer
is
good
happy
spot
on
ipa
beering
carbonation
again
is
ideal
mediumbodied
not
a
lite
beer
but
not
a
big
hop
bomb
either
a
topnotch
sessioner
particularly
in
warmer
months
very
drinkable
very
good
i
will
have
this
again
traditional
english
pale
ale
mixed
with
touches
of
rich
fruit
its
a
little
overly
bitter
but
overall
pretty
good
not
really
an
ipa
but
good
none
the
less
this
is
a
beer
that
i
can
imagine
would
be
damn
fine
on
cask
id
have
it
again
this
is
more
of
a
pale
ale
than
an
ipa
in
my
mind
but
who
am
i
looks
fine
a
little
chill
haze
with
a
decent
head
the
smell
is
the
most
perplexing
art
of
this
beer
for
me
i
smelled
it
so
much
i
got
a
little
up
my
nose
dont
act
like
it
has
never
happened
to
you
anyway
it
has
this
melon
like
canteloupe
sweetness
that
i
am
guessing
is
from
the
hop
combo
but
it
is
not
sharp
instead
very
dull
and
intriguing
not
quite
what
i
am
looking
for
in
an
ipa
the
taste
was
distort
by
the
melon
flavor
the
malt
was
there
but
there
was
no
hop
bite
and
it
was
undercarbonated
i
finished
it
well
enough
but
the
cantaloupe
is
not
a
fave
of
mine
i
would
like
to
have
this
beer
again
i
have
a
feeling
theres
more
to
it
than
you
can
really
tell
from
one
bottle
really
tasty
drinkable
and
delicate
ipa
its
not
weak
its
just
not
huge
nor
does
it
need
to
be
highly
recommended
and
this
is
my
favorite
bbc
beer
ive
had
so
far
out
of
this
river
ale
and
steel
rail
verdict
awesome
drinkability
a
good
pick
to
bring
to
a
superbowl
party
and
drink
all
afternoon
taste
is
not
exceptional
but
it
also
doesnt
have
any
negative
aspects
solid
overall
excellent
very
drinkable
ipa
quite
light
but
very
flavourful
at
the
same
time
i
really
like
this
brew
22
oz
bottle
hazy
peach
big
bubbles
of
carbonation
rise
to
meet
the
thin
wisps
of
lace
atop
sweet
herbal
hops
in
the
nose
and
quite
floral
and
estery
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
the
hops
find
the
palate
with
a
crisp
bitter
twang
in
the
finish
the
prelude
to
this
is
maltdominated
with
some
herbal
tea
notes
caramel
and
strawberries
carbonation
is
strong
and
spritzy
an
very
interesting
american
take
on
the
style
and
one
i
particularly
enjoy
session
style
for
sure
drinkability
is
decent
a
nice
englisheast
coast
ipa
just
not
something
i
would
repeat
buy
want
to
thank
bg
bif
and
goodbyeohio
for
this
local
brew
amazingly
wellbalanced
beer
as
a
hophead
i
love
the
stong
hop
profile
in
this
beer
fruity
esters
play
into
a
hand
of
hop
flavor
and
hop
bitter
all
this
amid
a
supporting
wet
malt
sweet
the
bomber
is
gone
im
kinda
lit
and
i
wish
i
had
a
bunch
more
of
this
one
conclusion
if
you
and
me
work
out
a
trade
and
you
need
to
come
up
with
one
more
beer
on
your
end
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
send
cheers
22oz

with

a

going

starts
with

with
some
citric
and
floral
hops
lightly
bitter
and
overall
well
balanced
iced
tea
thing
is
going
on
in
the
flavor
too
good
mouthfeel
to
it
and
pretty
drinkable
a
solid
ipa
all
around
but
nothing
that
will
really
wow
you
this
was
great
at
first
but
lost
me
in
the
end
still
id
really
need
to
try
it
fresh
from
the
brewery
or
from
the
bottle
the
growler
is
not
ideal
for
this
ale
very
satisfying
brew
thats
real
easy
to
inhale
it
has
a
lot
of
good
going
on
in
subtle
ways
its
nice
to
see
another
good
new
england
beer
that
really
impresses
me
for
its
flavor
and
balance
i
like
this
style
and
i
would
like
to
have
other
beers
like
it
no
freshness
date
beer
has
a
orangeamber
beercollor
amd
is
hazy
not
much
head
due
to
low
carbonisation
nose
is
lots
of
hops
giving
a
very
peach
and
pine
citrussym
impression
in
good

that
itself
shows
a
slight
carramellic
note
and
sweetness
to
the
nose
taste
is
good
hoppy
and
peachy
again
but
good
malted
not
to
sweet
and
overall
well
balanced
not
missing
the
carbonation
most
beers
have
and
very
well
drinkable
english
like
brew
drinkability
and
notes

good
drinkability
as
long
as
you
arent
a
hophead
looking
for
your
ipa
fix
this
is
another
solid
beer
from
berkshire
solid
but
not
phenomenal
a
good
intro
to
ipas
for
people
afraid
of
excessive
bitterness
a
good
drinkable
ipa
but
some
of
the
spicy
and
citris
flavours
carried
over
into
the
aftertaste
which
i
didnt
really
care
for
wow
lost
sailor
ipa
is
one
of
the
better
english
ipas
ive
tried
tasty
with
some
unusual
characteristics
and
easily
drinkable
was
3
45
for
the
bottle
at
charles
st
liquors
in
boston
and
worth
my
money
highly
drinkable
beer
if
i
could
get
it
down
my
way
rumor
has
it
they
will
be
exporting
this
very
soon
i
can
only
hope
overall
a
great
ipa
one
of
the
better
ive
tasted
from
the
us
probably
the
highest
drinkability
of
any
ive
tried
so
far
greatly
recommended
for
ipa
fans
well
done
bbc
again
the
smell
is
slightly
appleish
and
alcohol
is
quite
present
woody
elements
too
taste
is
a
sharp
bite
and
and
then
smooths
out
like
a
pale
ale
more
than
an
ipa
probably
would
be
better
served
on
the
colder
side
mine
is
probably
about
4550
fahrenheit
and
it
seems
like
it
could
benefit
from
being
a
tad
colder
i
still
think
its
a
decent
beer
the
hops
in
the
flavor
are
covered
by
a
corny
sweetness
and
mild
honey
notes
refreshing
my
idea
of
a
lawnmower
beer
as
are
most
bbc
beers
except
for
the
flavorful
octoberfest
which
i
cherish
not
the
complexity
i
was
hoping
for
but
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
wow
bottle
best
by
june
the
beer
poured
with
very
little
head
and
was
a
deep
orange
in
color
the
aroma
is
tangerine
the
taste
is
surprising
not
a
very
hoppy
ipa
almost
pale
ale
in
its
kick
also
melon
came
through
nicely
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
crsip
i
notice
the
malts
and
they
were
perfectly
balanced
by
the
hops
not
too
much
of
a
kick
but
just
enough
to
remind
me
they
were
there
i
was
tempted
to
open
te
secind
bomber
but
decided
to
hold
off
for
another
day
drinkable
yes
yes
and
yes

color
with
a
substantial

is
mellow
musty
with
a
floral
hop
scent
and
a
sweet
bready
malty
body
taste
has
just
enough
hops
to
be
considered
an
ipa
remember
were
talking
english
style
here
more
subdued
and
not
so
flamboyantly
american
i
love
american
ipas
but
this
has
its
merits
too
nice
and
buttery
and
biscuity
as
in
a
classic
english
ale
yet
with
some
nice
bitter
hops
at
the
end
malt
doesnt
hide
in
this
one
either
its
right
up
front
with
the
hops
real
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
almost
casklike
a
great
example
of
the
style
to
show
us
that
hops
are
used
in
all
kinds
of
different
ways
overall
am
i
a
ruined
hophead
dont
expect
a
hop
monster

you
wouldnt

lends

to

very
fruity

citrus
and
more
i
sense
tart
apple
too
this
unique

comes
over
in

too
bright

with

i
not

if
this

from

the

strain
used
in

this
beer
is
extremely
smooth
on

one
of
th
emost
drinkable
ipas
ive
ever
had
before

to
me
did
not
fully

of

balanced

checking

notes
very

this
is
one
of
the
better
ipas
i
have
had
because
it
is
not
west
coast
extreme
bitter
it
is
nice
to
have
a
very
balanced
ipa
with
malt
and
sweet
tastes
to
it
i
was
very
impressed
this
is
one
that
i
would
probably
have
another
of
nothing
spectactular
but
worth
a
try
if
you
are
interested
in
english
ipas
pretty
drinkable
as
well
given
the
toned
down
hop
profile
this
ipa
poured
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
offwhite
foam
that
settled
but
clung
to
the
glass
and
coated
the
glass
the
smell
was
hoppy
with
some
floral
hops
and
some
leafy
hops
together
with
some
maltiness
not
overwhelming
hoppy
however
the
taste
was
hoppy
with
some
grassy
and
citrus
hops
which
gave
a
dry
somewhat
woody
flavor
there
was
a
good
malt
backbone
to
this
english
style
ipa
the
mouthfeel
was
hoppy
and
dry
with
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
there
was
a
bit
of
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
this
was
a
nice
not
overpoweringly
hopped
ipa
cheers
thanks
to
ppoitras
for
the
bottle
this
hazy
amber
beer
forms
a
modest
head
and
looks
much
like
many
a
british
ipa
the
aroma
offers
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
as
well
as
a
subtle
hint
of
the
citrus
within
the
lost
sailor
is
a
remarkably
complex
and
almost
overly
balanced
brew
it
pairs
hop
bitterness
with
a
perfect
compliments
of
malts
that
not
only
stand
up
to
the
abusive
flavors
but
can
compliment
and
almost
surpass
them
in
intensity
this
balance
is
reminiscent
of
a
barley
wine
and
is
quite
remarkable
for
a
full
bodied
ale
with
such
a
modest
alcohol
content
if
there
werent
so
many
beers
to
try
at
the

would
have
ordered
a

overall
check
this
out
and
support
this
small
massachusetts
microbrewery
overall
a
nice
offering
from
this
company
one
of
the
better
beers
they
produce
imho
its
not
a
hop
monster
imperial
ipa
but
its
a
good
quality
ipa
on
the
low
side
of
american
or
high
side
of
british
drinkability
a
unique
ipa
good
for
a
change
of
pace
i
like
it
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
drinking
it
regularly
fighting
a
hard
fight
in
a
nation
of
ballsy

berkshire
has
a

go

a

as
ever
this
would
be
a
great

choice
for
picnics
and
sociable
get
togethers
make
sure
you
check
the
freshness
date
on
the
side
of
the
bottles
though
as
this
beer
is
low
in
hops
and
alcohol
and
wont
sit
well
for

this
will
be
my
brew
for

hops
are
quite

sweet
the
malts
go
unnoticed
throught
the
hop
flavor
but
are
still
there
as
the
backbone
with
their
fruity
goodness
a
nice
mouthfeel
for
an

me
back
home

nice

pour
well
carbonated
aroma
was
excellent
a
light
fruity
citrus
that
invites
you
to
drink
not
the
usual
bitter
kick
of
an
ipa
but
interesting
nonetheless
very
citrusy
and
wellrounded
with
a
smoothness
that
was
unexpected
the
bitter
quality
of
the
usual
ipa
hit
as
an
aftertaste
that
didnt
overstay
its
welcome
mouthfeel
was
nice
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
definitely
worth
trying
a
few
times
just
to
figure
it
out
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
that
is
somewhat
hazy
the
white
head
was
minimal
and
didnt
stay
long
or
provide
any
lacing
down
the

the
aroma
is
lightly
of
hops
pinegrapefruit
and

hard
call
as
to
the

poured
a

aroma
was
just
beautiful
juicy

peach

with
a
sweet

tasting
it
was
like
biting
into
an
overripe
peach
that
drips
down
your
chin
onto
your

the
flavor
aspect
of
the
hop
is
really
accented
here
as
i
didnt
find
this
beer
to
be
overly
bitter
but
mightily
flavorful
finishes
sugary

a

with

for

this
is
not
over
powering
with
hops

many
are
starts
sweet
but
the
hops
do
kick
in
before
the
finish
medium
bodied
slightly
bitter
but
not
dry
this
beer
while
appropriately
bitter
does
not
provide
the
crazy
explosion
of
hops
provided
by
the
big
ipas
so
celebrated
these
days
and
thats
part
of
what
i
like
about
it

you
into

finish
this
englishstyle
ipa
is
much
more
balanced
than
many
of
its
americanstyle
counterparts
just
a
fabulous
brew
and
one
which
ill
pick
up
a
good
deal
more
of
next
time
im
in
western
ma
this
is
a
kickin
ipa
strong
hop
flavor
and
good
bitterness
this
beer
was
not
hopped
for
bitterness
alone
whatever
flower
used
has
a
great
aroma
and
flavor
characterisitc
quite
good
all
around
a
damn
fine
ipa
and
one
of
the
best
in
ma
this
ipa
really
appeals
to
me
because
it
shows
off
both
a
big
malt
and
big
hop
character
but
the
beer
is
so
in
balance
and
the
flavours
are
so
smoothed
together
notes
one
of
the
better
domestic
english
style
ipas
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
well
balanced
and
poised
as
a

i
would

a

for

its
just
ok
kind
of
watered

the
taste
is
not
bad
with
slightly
yeasty
flavor
up

overall
this
is

but
it
seems
kind
of
by

numbers
english
style
to
me
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
overall
the
flavor
was
alright
but
not
really
all
that
hoppy
and
sorta
weak
for
an
ipa
nothing
too
outrageously
good
here
o
well
brewed
well
balanced

one
of
my
favorites
in
this
style
of
beers
overall
a
nice
ipa
it
looks

and
is
easily
drinkable
recommended
o
this
one
straddles
the
line
of
goodokay
its
not
unenjoyable
by
any
means
but
its
just
not
what
youd
expect
from
an
ipa
it
has
a
strong
maltiness
and
a
very
restrained
hop
presence
it
drinks
extremely
well
and
tastes
good
which
makes
this
a
prime
contender
for
a
session
ale
at
a
bar
but
its
not
something
id
pick
up
again
for
the
pleasure
of
homeconsumption
good

overall
slightly
weak

standards
12

my
second
beer
from
flying

the
first
being
their
pale
ale
i
like
this
one
a
lot
more
this
could
almost
stand
up
to
most
american
ipas
in
balance
and
taste
goes
down
a
little
too
smooth
with
not
enough
bite
having
said
that
i
enjoy
this
beer
a
heck
of
a
lot
for
a
jersey
brew
overall
i
am
usually
impressed
with
most
flying
fish
offerings
and
this
one
is
pretty
damn
good
not
the
biggest
english
ipa
fan
but
this
is
drinkable
hopfish
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
sharp
but
sweet
floral
aroma
the
taste
is
similar
a
sharp
hop
bite
but
with
a
sweet
finish
nice
full
flavor
and
full
body
overall
its
a
nice
ipa
some
good
flavors
but
harsh
finish
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
not
bad
at
all
overall
a
solid
english
ipa
the
sourness
is
a
bit
odd
but
not
unpleasant
i
could
stand
to
drink
a
few
more
but
nothing
id
want
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
o
eh
a
decent
english
ipa
at
that
but
nothing
to
go
after
its
just
drinkable
onot
bad
but
it
doesnt
meet
my
expectations
for
an
ipa
on
several
levels
strong
ipa
with
a
rather
dank
hop
profile
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
very
good

the

pretty
good
little
light

i
think
this
is
a
good
summer
time
beer
its
a
ipa
thats
a
little
lighter
on
the
overall
hopiness
the
bite
is
not
overpowering
in
the
begining
and
then
that
mellows
into
a
rich
mouth
feel
a
lightly
floral
smell
helps
to
open
up
the
flavors
of
the
hops
without
becoming
overpowering
also
its
moderate
alcohol
content
makes
this
an
easy
drinking
brew
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
id
like
more
hop
flavor
and
aroma
bitterness
is
there
however
overall
i
like
this
beer
and
it
has
a
definite
english
feel
to
it
but
the
yeast
and
the
hops
seem
to
be
a
bit
off
the
yeast
seems
to
impart
a
biscuity
and
almost
belgian
taste
to
it
and
the
hops
seem
to
be
more
on
the
lines
of
pacific
northwest
in
format
i
dont
know
what
they
use
its
a
good
beer
and
very
drinkable
i
like
it
its
not
incredible
or
awesome
but
very
satisfying
on
a
warm
evening

out

this
tastes

perhaps
they
should
give
it
another
go
with
a
modified
recipe
o
decent
drinkable
but
not
overall
a
huge
fan
a
lighter
ipa
for
sure
overall
good
but
certainly
not
great
i
have
never
been
a
big
fan
of
eipas
and
this
is
not
one
of
the
few
that
i
have
had
that
is
an
exception
to
the
rule
would
not
get
again
generally
would

are
good
only
real
fault
is
all
the
suspended
yeast
aroma
of
some
spicy
hop
with
a
strong
malty
background
to
my
understanding
thats
dictated
by
the
style
some
citrus
present
taken
a
bit
aghast
by
the
malt
used
to
my
hoppy
west
coast
ipa
taste
is
really
good
nice
crisp
hops
balanced
perfectly
with
the
malt
feel
is
consistent
also
dry
finish
no
alcohol
and
very
bitter
overall
surprised
how
much
i
liked
this
quite
balanced
served
from
a
bottle
light
amber
color
with
solid
2finger
head
aroma
is
citrusy
but
a
bit
lacking
for
an
ipa
taste
matches
the
aroma
solid
citrus
but
maybe
a
bit
stale
in
the
finish
overall
a
solid
ipa
however
with
all
the
solid
ipa
options
out
there
not
sure
if
id
make
it
a
go
to
this
beer
pours
up
a
clear
medium
gold
with
about
a
one
finger
head
not
much
retention
but
some
risidual
lacing
the
smell
is
very
citrus
floral
and
pine
malt
dominates
up
front
followed
by
a
powerful
grapefruit
and
spicy
hop
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
pretty
nice
medium
thick
and
satisfying
id
drink
this
again
this
one
really
surprised
me
it
was
so
easy
to
drink
and
had
a
great
balance
of
mild
bitterness
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
i
will
make
sure
to
get
some
more
of
this
just
remember
this
isnt
supposed
to
be
sculpin
or
stone
ipa
and
the
like
so
please
dont
review
it
like
it
is
this
is
an
eipa
and
a
good
one
at
that
pours
a
copper
amber
hue
with
a
medium
lasting
off
white
head
aroma
and
taste
of
caramel
malt
floral
citrus
hops
yeast
and
fruity
esters
palate
is
a
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
finish
is
caramel
malt
citrus
floral
hops
some
yeast
seems
a
bit
on
the
malty
side
overall
a
typical
ipa
nothing
really
stand
out
but
good
drinking
brew
overall
pretty
solid
score
here
on
my
travels
from
boston
to
md
and
back
over
thanksgiving
will
look
for
this
one
next
time
i
head
back
down
in
that
area
o
started
out
nicely
but
was
a
bit
too
mild
in
the
end
taste
is
jammy
marmalade
raisiny
alcohol
medicinal
herb
hint
its
balanced
but
with
hop
bite
just
getting
the
edge
at
finish
aftertaste
its
spritzy
with
leafy
medicinal
faintly
orangerind
finish
and
bitterness
with
a
little
mineral
its
very
good
and
enjoyable
if
a
bit
simple
and
slightly
thin
nothing
is
wrong
with
this
beer
but
nothing
is
exceptional
either
off
tap
at
jack
dunnigans
in
the
airport
this
beer
was
an
apricot
color
with
some
golden
highlights
the
head
formed
by
lots
of
rising
carbonation
was
beige
colored
and
displayed
nice
retention
and
moderate
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
american
hops
some
orange
and
mango
notes
amarillo
hops
and
a
note
of
must
the
flavors
were
rather
average
i
thought
being
mostly
a
blend
of
crystal
malt
pale
malt
and
citrus
from
the
hops
it
was
not
as
bitter
as
most
americanmade
ipas
and
though
sessionable
it
seemed
uninspired
the
body
was
medium
the
mouthfeel
average
and
the
carbonation
a
little
too
high
o
overall
a
decent
brew
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
insane
fruitiness
in
the
nose
these
notes
blended
beautifully
and
sweetly
with
big
piney
hops
the
following
taste
was
almost
as
nice
but
all
the
components
become
a
bit
muddled
by
the
end
with
all
of
the
stark
flavorings
crashing
together
strong
effort
for
the
style
and
always
happy
to
drink
local
pours
a
almost
clear
burnt
orange
color
with
a
tight
half
finger
head
this
beer
leaves
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
notes
along
with
a
herbal
smell
and
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
sweetness
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
citrus
and
herbal
flavor
up
front
this
gives
way
to
a
dark
fruit
sweetness
and
then
a
very
slight
earthy
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
low
to
moderatly
carbonated
overall
it
is
not
bad
a
nice
blend
of
hops
and
malt
enjoyable
but
not
great
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
not
one
that
will
knock
your
socks
off
but
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
nonetheless
mouthfeel
is
fine
on
tap
smooth
a
little
creamy
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
left
me
feel
a
bit
uninspired
and
maybe
a
little
bored
mouthfeel
i
thought
there
was
just
a
tad
too
much
carbonation
here
it
took
away
from
some
of
the
more
subtle
flavors
overall
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
perhaps
i
need
to
try
this
again
because
if
the
flavors
didnt
seem
so
faded
it
may
have
been
better
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
white
head
that
shows
great
retention
and
lace
smells
of
earthy
and
citrusy
hops
with
a
bit
of
bready
malt
some
mineral
aromas
and
a
bit
of
yeasty
funk
taste
is
a
nice
compromise
between
malt
and
hop
earthy
citrus
meets
bready
mineral
water
and
a
hint
of
yeast
funk
medium
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
mouthfeel
meh
this
one
is
ok
but
theres
either
some
wild
yeast
working
in
this
bottle
or
the
beer
was
kept
on
the
yeast
too
long
after
fermentation
no
bottle
dating
so
theres
no
telling
how
old
this
bottle
is
perhaps
ive
been
unlucky
with
this
bottle
and
will
become
enamoured
with
my
remaining
5
in
which
case
i
will
change
this
review
accordingly
this
beer
was
very
nice
and
tasty
good
looking
beer
with
an
outstanding
white
cap
that
left
a
bit
of
foam
on
my
glass
classic
micro
brew
scent
some
pine
scents
on
the
nose
but
also
very
malty
not
overly
hoppy
but
you
must
classify
this
as
an
ipa
cannot
see
through
the
glass
much
like
a
great
hefeweizen
nice
tasting
buscuit
base
very
pleased
with
the
finish
very
fine
brew
note
had
at
the
brewery
and
it
was
a
completely
different
beer
sooo
much
better
notes
of
rose
and
flower
so
good
fresh
on
tap
at
the
office
pours

easy
drinking
ipa
decent
though
not
outstanding
ipa
nugget
hops
and
lots
of

to
make
it
bittersweet
and
the
malting
contributes
to
drinkability
as
does
the
understated

light
orange
body
orange
taste
and
slight
orange
aroma
middling
mouthfeel
guessing
ibu
5560
o
overall
a
pretty
average
ipa
nose
had
the
faintest
smell
of
hops
to
it
while
the
taste
had
none
really
at
all
not
one
of
flying
fishs
finest
and
not
one
id
seek
out
again
o
good
but
standard
neither
exciting
nor
a
letdown
overall
i
didnt
really
like
this
but
that
is
because
i
really
dont
like
english
style
anything
the
choice
of
malts
and
hops
are
spot
on
for
the
style
but
really
not
my
choice
to
enjoy
i
will
score
this
with
the
style
in
mind
though
and
if
english
ipas
are
your
thing
this
might
be
worth
searching
out
o
good
rep
of
the
style
with
rich
caramel
malts
and
tropical
fruit
hop
aromas
if
it
finished
more
bitter
rather
than
sweet
this
would
be
great
solid
ipa
not
must
have
overall
this
is
a
mild
example
of
the
style
the
hops
are
toned
down
and
the
malt
is
over
played
the
balance
just
isnt
there
this
would
be
a
great
english
style

with

some
grassy
herbal
flavors
as
well
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
smooth
and
slightly
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
english
ipa
and
my
first
beer
from
flying
fish
i
probably
wouldnt
get
this
one
again
though
i
originally
thought
this
was
a
tasty
pale
ale
then
i
found
out
it
was
a
ipa
i
was
a
little
shocked
because
of
the
bitterness
was
kind
of
low
i
like
my
ipas
very
bitter
but
this
hopfish
ipa
had
a
sweet
citrus
and
piney
taste
that
kept
me
asking
for
another
o
on
smelling
the
nose
i
was
ready
for
disappointment
but
this
turned
out
pretty
darn
good
this
is
a
balanced
east
coast
ipa
get
any
thought
of
san
diego
out
of
your
head
because
you
wont
get
it
enjoy
a
complex
flavourful
balanced
ale
good
job
flying
fish
d
overall
a
decent
ipa
that
has
a
good
mix
of
everything
and
a
reasonable
abv
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
light
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
overwhemingly
of
hops
taste
is
also
very
hoppy
a
touch
of
citrus
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
while
not
a
bad
beer
i
thought
it
was
lacking
in
balance
o
overall
very
good
beer
nice
and
smooth
and
great
for
a
malty
ipa
d
no
bitterness
low
carbonation
not
sweet
which
was
nice
this
ipa
pours
out
as
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
decent
sized
head
on
it
the
head
doesnt
give
off
too
much
lacing
really
the
smell
has
a
pretty
good
hoppiness
to
it
but
its
nothing
too
crazy
the
taste
has
an
average
amount
of
bitterness
mixed
with
a
malt
body
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
not
a
lot
of
complexity
here
overall
to
me
its
an
average
ipa
its
worth
trying
if
your
trying
to
ween
yourself
into
the
style
o
this
was
just
really
not
a
very
good
beer

what

lots
of
nice

hides
the

ok
oa
decent
enough
ipa
but
when
there
are
so
many
other
better
options
out
there
why
would
i
choose
this
one
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
nothing
that
makes
me
want
to
have
another
nothing
offensive
in
this
baby
it
does
have
a
dry
finish
and
seems
pretty
balanced
overall
not
a
bad
session
beer
but
not
something
id
have
everyday
either
only
due
to
its
dry
finish
that
said
go
grab
one
and
see
for
yourself
d
this
is
a
fresh
cleandrinking
brew
not
quite
a
traditional
english
ipa
and
not
really
an
american
ipa
maybe
not
an
ipa
at
all
given
its
breadiness
yet
highly
drinkable
picked
this
up
at
total
wine
tempe
awesome
store
had
some
of
these
guys
exit
series
and
was
excited
to
try
one
of
the
regulars
nice
amber
pour
nice
caramel
soft
nose
this
is
a
very
creamy
and
smooth
beer
and
very
tasty
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
wish
there
were
more
of
smooth
tasty
and
under
7
so
you
can
have
a
few
very
highly
recommend
this
its
in
az
for
all
you
ca
folks
i
will
be
picking
up
more
of
this
when
i
head
back
down
i
normally
wouldnt
want
this
in
an
ipa
but
for
some
reason
they
really
get
the
balance
down
good
on
this
one
because
it
still
leaves
that
pretty
bitter
aftertaste
my
only
objection
to
this
beer
is
that
i
wish
they
had
freshness
dates
on
it
because
i
think
mine
might
be
kind
of
out
of
date
because
i
know
my
store
doesnt
get
brand
new
6
packs
of
this
stuff
every
week
id
love
to
have
this
on
tap
and
probably
will
since
i
live
in
nj
my
first
flying
fish
beer
and
definitely
not
my
last
the
malt
and
unfiltered
taste
reminds
me
of
the
taste
you
get
from
the
cricket
hill
ipa
but
this
one
has
more
hops
to
balance
so
i
like
this
one
better
not
a
hop
bomb
but
definitely
an
amazingly
balanced
ipa
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
that
retains
ok
the
aroma
is
mostly
grainy
along
with
some
faint
citrusy
pine
and
herbal
hops
fruity
esters
and
just
the
suggestion
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
a
step
up
from
the
aroma
with
big
citrus
and
herbal
hops
upfront
along
with
some
caramel
and
grainy
malt
fruity
esters
biscuit
and
some
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thick
side
and
grainy
and
drinkability
is
good
a
decent
stab
at
an
ipa
but
the
grainy
mouthfeel
and
inauspicious
aroma
hold
this
beer
back
extremely
smooth
and
i
mean
extremely
there
was
a
copious
amount
of
carbonation
that
really
helped
set
everything
in
motion
a
good
clean
crisp
feel
was
what
i
was
used
to
but
this
was
much
more
mellow
and
smooth
and
very
rich
in
texture
you
could
really
feel
what
was
going
in
very
nice
and
a
welcome
little
treat
i
was
starting
to
warm
up
to
this
one
actually
superb
i
could
have
had
another
and
another
again
it
was
just
light
and
flavorful
but
not
nearly
anything
that
would
have
held
you
back
from
it
at
all
i
just
was
sitting
there
and
all
of
a
sudden
realized
it
was
gone
i
had
no
idea
that
it
was
going
to
be
going
away
that
quickly
really
a
great
little
ale
d
definitely
very
much
drinkable
it
pours
a
fairly
clear
for
the
style
amber
color
with
a
fingers
worth
of
head
lacing
and
retention
are
below
average
the
smell
is
primarily
pale
malts
with
some
citrus
and
floral
hops
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
primarily
bitter
the
crisp
pale
malts
citrus
and
smooth
floral
hops
all
come
together
for
a
very
easy
drinking
bitter
beer
the
aftertaste
does
have
a
bit
of
resiny
hops
to
make
this
feel
more
like
an
ipa
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
but
can
be
forgiven
the
drinkability
is
absolutely
exceptional
i
could
see
this
disappearing
very
quickly
a
solid
beer
and
my
first
from
the
brewery
curious
to
how
this
will
differ
from
their
normal
pale
ale
poured
a
clear
light
orange
with
a
small
white
head
that
mostly
diminished
the
aroma
was
light
to
moderate
caramel
malt
and
moderate
pine
and
citrus
hops
the
initial
flavor
was
moderately
sweet
lightly
acidic
and
bitter
while
the
finish
was
moderately
to
heavily
sweet
and
moderately
bitter
with
and
average
duration
the
flavor
was
malt
then
pine
and
citrus
hops
the
light
to
medium
body
was
a
little
watery
at
first
and
then
dry
with
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
moderately
astringent
finish
very
easygoing
and
smooth
and
so
nonoffensiveness
you
wouldnt
notice
you
downed
the
pack
d
very
smooth
drink
due
to
its
malthop
balance
i
can
notice
the
diminished
hop
character
as
this
is
not
an
american
ipa
but
actually
an
attempt
at
an
english
ipa
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
solid
ipa
not
particularly
english
overall
a
dry
bitter
citrusy
beer
thats
not
particularly
malty
but
with
decent
balance
drinkability
displays
a
good
degree
of
balance
as
its
not
particular
malty
nor
particularly
hoppy
though
thats
not
always
what
folks
are
looking
for
from
their
ipas
i
think
i
could
have
several
of
these
to
expand
the
enjoyment
of
the
subtle
flavors
but
on
its
own
one
bottle
or
glass
doesnt
pack
the
most
memorable
punch
overall
this
is
a
good
ipa
not
an
ipa
you
need
to
search
out
for
but
if
you
see
it
on
draft
it
is
a
good
choice
over
the
average
domestic
selection
recommended
over
noncraft
selections
but
nothing
to
wax
poetic
about
very
drinkable
i
just
wont
be
reaching
for
another
soon
d
like
i
said
almost
too
light
for
its
style
but
extremely
easy
to
drink
a
great
session
beer
and
i
would
pick
it
up
again
if
it
was
at
my
local
store
pours
a
light
orange
amber
with
a
touch
of
cludiness
and
a
short
head
smells
somewhat
grainy
but
with
a
fruity
overlay
and
some
grassiness
the
taste
is
grainier
still
and
the
hop
fruitiness
tends
to
get
lost
although
there
is
a
lingering
bitterness
and
a
little
squirt
of
grapefruit
juice
near
the
end
not
as
grainy
in
the
mouthfeel
although
overall
this
a
fairly
bland
ipa
ive
enjoyed
their
belgian
style
beers
more
d
good
the
alcohol
is
hidden
nicely
very
drinkable
not
bad
for
my
first
ff
offering
im
interested
in
trying
more
from
them
revised
with
12
oz

drinkability
i
could
have
several
just
a
great
earthy
floral
beer
that
is
not
overly
hopped
one
of
the
more
distinct
ipas
i
have
had
that
i
wish
i
could
get
here
drinkability
fantastic
brew
its
not
a
hop
bomb
ale
but
its
a
decent
selection
could
have
used
more
hops
overall
this
was
a
middleoftheroad
ipa
nothing
done
terribly
and
nothing
done
terribly
well
either
not
worth
seeking
out
but
if
there
are
no
other
options
as
was
the
case
at
drinkers
its
not
a
bad
choice
drinkabilitywhile
this
beer
plays
true
to
style
its
a
tough
one
for
me
to
like
given
its
aggressiveness
there
are
some
flavors
in
here
that
taste
a
little
off
to
my
palate
another
very
drinkable
flying
fish
brew
i
need
to
have
a
few
more
of
their
brews
more
regularly
bottle
poured
an
amber
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
consists
of
noble
hops
mix
with
some
citrus
notes
is
quite
refreshing
and
provide
the
impression
of
a
belgian
ipa
taste
is
also
a
great
mix
between
some
slightly
sweet
malt
notes
with
little
caramel
notes
and
a
unique
mix
between
some
noble
hops
and
west
coast
hops
bring
a
nice
floral
tone
with
some
citrus
and
dry
notes
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
i
though
this
was
a
great
refreshing
beer
under
the
sun
m
good
feel
this
one
is
definitely
a
lighter
ipa
perhaps
a
good
starting
point
for
one
wishing
to
get
into
hoppier
beers
that
said
i
really
like
each
quality
of
this
beer
but
do
think
it
would
benefit
from
an
overall
though
not
necessarily
huge
intensity
boost
update
tried
this
again
082510
it
was
bottled
today
i
was
interested
to
try
this
fresh
for
obvious
reasons
ill
restate
my
previous
opinionobservation
that
this
beer
has
striking
esb
qualities
in
mouthfeel
and
flavor
if
you
take
away
the
soft
tropical
fruit
essence
to
the
hop
aroma
different
unique
but
nice
you
have
an
esb
they
nailed
the
mouthfeel
and
and
flavors
of
the
english
esbs
i
adore
one
of
the
few
us
breweries
i
feel
has
done
it
but
really
going
into
this
im
thinking
ipa
and
it
doesnt
meet
my
expectations
of
american
versions
im
willing
to
offer
however
that
the
hopfish
is
best
viewed
as
a
unique
take
strictly
in
the
hop
character
on
a
true
english
ipa
unfortunately
i
havent
had
much
experience
at
all
trying
english
ipas
deuchars
ipa
from
scotland
is
the
closest
ive
come
to
it
and
even
that
isnt
exactly
what
im
getting
at
here
the
closest
thing
to
deuchars
ipa
ive
had
over
here
is
left
hands
400
pound
monkey
the
closest
thing
ive
had
to
flying
fishs
hopfish
has
been
batemans
xxxb
excellent
ale
anyway
if
you
can
locate
a
bottle
of
the
batemans
xxxb
try
it
and
imagine
it
with
an
almost
pina
colada
hop
aroma
and
flavor
thats
what
i
feel
is
going
on
with
the
hopfish
interesting
brew
for
sure
not
what
im
accustomed
to
as
far
as
american
ipas
go
pours
a
clear
amber
like
a
medium
color
honey
with
a
big
fluffy
head
both
the
flavor
and
the
aroma
are
malty
and
sweetly
raw
like
the
freshly
boiled
wort
of
a
beer
before
the
yeast
starts
it
work
the
hops
are
fresh
and
flowery
with
a
little
bit
of
a
piny
finish
there
is
a
little
bitterness
on
the
end
but
it
is
sweet
and
citrusy
like
a
mild
marmalade
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
slightly
flat
the
mouth
feel
also
leaves
quite
a
bit
to
be
desired
the
carbonation
is
there
but
it
all
tastes
rather
acidic
which
leads
to
the
drinkability
this
beer
is
nice
and
refreshing
but
the
whole
time
i
feel
like
its
stripping
away
at
my
mouth
o
i
remember
this
being
much
better
in
the
past
perhaps
the
recipe
has
changed
maybe
my
palate
has
gotten
better
or
maybe
the
hopsecutioner
i
just
drank
just
dwarfs
this
but
its
very
bland
its
very
drinkable
but
theres
not
much
going
on
here
at
least
its
available
at
a
good
price
d
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
and
i
must
admit
i
am
a
bit
surprised
at
this
one
in
that
i
have
noticed
that
flying
fish
brews
tend
to
be
hit
or
miss
a
decent
session
ipa
that
wont
eviscerate
your
palate
too
much
a
light
mouthfeel
for
sure
its
almost
watery
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
looking
forward
to
getting
more
of
this
when
it
heats
up
this
summer
its
only
feb
ugh
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
formed
a
14
offwhite
head
above
the
clear
amber
brew
head
falls
slowly
with
average
to
good
lacing
aroma
is
fruity
and
earthy
taste
starts
biscuity
malts
lightly
citrus
in
the
middle
and
closes
with
a
medium
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
id
probably
have
given
this
beer
a
much
higher
score
if
it
was
a
pale
ale
by
style
a
tons
of
active
carbonation
streaming
up
through
the
beer
though
the
head
stays
pretty
consistent
at
a
pencils
thickness
the
color
is
a
medium
copper
the
head
is
thick
and
tightly
packed
and
leaves
some
lacing
as
the
beer
drops
3
50
s
the
nose
is
quite
biscuity
and
bready
theres
also
a
decent
amount
of
citrus
that
comes
through
and
a
mild
orangelike
sweetness
3
00
t
though
there
is
a
noticeable
hop
presence
this
beer
skirts
the
line
between
a
pale
ale
and
an
ipa
in
my
opinion
some
pine
and
pineapple
jumbled
with
some
caramel
malts
3
50
m
theres
a
little
syrupyness
which
provides
a
smoothness
to
the
mouth
feel
4
00
d
a
decent
ipa
pretty
standard
3
50
p
s
stone
ruination
is
great
just
packs
a
real
wallop
and
may
not
be
the
most
sessionable
brew
but
there
are
different
beers
for
different
occassions
this
is
a
subtle
brew
and
i
prefer
more
hopiness
however
its
a
very
soild
drinkable
ale
this
is
a
good
brew
very
tasty
and
refreshing
this
would
be
a
very
good
brew
to
drink
in
the
summer
at
a
bbq
good
lots
of
malt
in
this
guy
hops
get
a
little
lost
at
first
i
was
really
disappointed
but
now
i
realize
its
an
english
ipa
and
that
makes
a
lot
more
sense
most
of
the
hop
bitterness
comes
in
an
aftertaste
no
strong
hop
aroma
beer
has
a
medium
body
overall
ok
i
really
wanted
a
hoppy
beer
oh
well
mouthfeel
is
light
and
dry
carbonation
is
spot
on
very
gentle
carbonation
just
how
i
like
it
outstanding
drinkability
if
i
had
another
bottle
i
would
have
it
right
now
d
i
wish
i
could
have
had
it
sooner
as
im
sure
it
only
would
have
been
better
than
this
but
its
not
awful
it
just
needs
a
bit
of
work
to
get
up
there
the
hops
are
really
lacking
otherwise
its
drinkable
in
this
form
drinkability
as
i
noted
in
my
bottle
review
this
beer
drinks
easily
i
think
it
is
a
bit
better
on
draft
than
from
the
bottle
even
though
the
carbonation
seems
less
however
as
i
noted
in
my
bottle
review
given
its
balance
of
flavors
my
feeling
is
this
beer
is
much
closer
to
an
english
style
ipa
than
to
an
american
style
ipa
i
could
easily
have
a
second
and
ill
certainly
drink
it
again
in
fact
i
just
did
d
after
having
the
extra
pale
ale
i
was
rather
surprised
with
this
ipa
almost
boarders
on
being
an
english
ipa
as
the
hops
are
pretty
mellow
granted
there
are
some
better
ipas
out
there
but
this
one
is
worth
a
try
taste
is
like
an
oktoberfest
mmm
looks
like
the
hops
have
fallen
out
but
this
isnt
bad
i
think
its
quite
tasty
i
tend
to
like
a
stronger
more
hoppy
ipa
but
i
wouldnt
mind
this
one
again
give
it
a
shot
if
youre
in
the
area
drinkability
overall
it
was
a
decent
offering
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
when
it
comes
to
ipas
although
the
hops
are
present
the
malt
really
overshadows
everything
else
in
the
glass
i
really
did
like
this
but
if
the
malt
was
toned
down
this
would
be
a
regular
in
my
rotation
had
a
nice
pour
at
a
local
bar
into
an
american
pint
glass
copper
hue
with
a
nice
longlasting
and
lacing
head
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
some
people
mentioned
a
lack
of
hops
in
the
nose
and
the
taste
maybe
it
was
a
bad
batch
or
being
accustomed
to
so
many
crazyhopped
double
ipas
currently
on
the
market
but
i
found
the
nose
to
be
both
floral
and
bitter
hoppy
combined
with
traces
of
grapefruit
orange
and
lime
also
detected
a
malty
sweetness
the
flavor
was
very
similar
with
the
fruitiness
up
front
giving
way
to
malty
sweetness
and
finished
off
with
dry
hop
bitterness
the
bitterness
lingered
significantly
in
the
aftertaste
definitely
a
malty
fairly
full
bodied
specimen
for
an
ipa
but
the
aromaflavor
made
it
go
down
easy
a
very
good
session
ipa
i
thought
this
beer
was
way
too
malty
for
an
ipa
am
i
missing
something
i
thought
it
looked
great
carbonation
was
fine
had
a
nice
head
but
when
i
was
looking
for
that
kick
of
hops
nothing
was
there
did
i
get
a
bad
case
i
dont
know
but
until
then
ill
assume
that
this
brew
is
too
malty
and
short
on
the
hops
overall
leans
more
towards
an
esb
tasty
and
sessionable
for
sure
brilliant
buttery
hop
action
with
a
terrific
nose
to
this
beer
md
a
bit
sticky
yet
thin
body
i
think
they
either
need
to
up
the
bittering
hops
or
bring
down
some
of
the
sweetness
to
get
it
right
for
the
style
easy
to
drink
and
price
right
locally
aromas
of
a
muddy
peach
first
come
to
mind
very
stagnant
herbal
quality
to
it
the
taste
turns
to
a
slightly
flat
malt
flavor
that
has
a
maybe
some
oxidation
paper
quality
to
it
the
medium
mouth
feel
also
lends
it
self
to
a
sweeter
quality
to
the
beer
kicking
the
much
needed
bitterness
to
the
side
it
finishes
with
a
pseudo
dryness
in
the
middle
of
the
tongue
but
leaves
a
earthy
aftertaste
on
my
palette
overall
its
ok
in
my
book
nice
golden
amber
with
a
fair
to
average
head
smelled
a
bit
tart
and
obviously
hoppy
taste
really
didnt
do
it
for
me
ive
had
mush
better
in
the
way
of
hoppy
beers
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
not
necessarily
in
a
good
way
more
because
it
is
slighlty
watered
down
meh
d
i
could
see
drinking
this
from
the
bottle
at
a
tailgate
but
its
not
one
to
seek
out
drink
is
ok
the
bitterness
does
settle
enough
to
have
a
few
more
for
easy
drinking
and
a
very
solid
ipa
an
ipa
that
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
quite
enjoyable
flying
fish
seems
to
get
passed
over
by
many
in
favor
of
the
other
philly
area
beers
and
that
to
me
is
a
shame
i
like
this
one
i
had
this
on
tap
at
swedes
inn
it
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
medium
white
head
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
had
pine
and
citrus
notes
but
not
overwhelming
the
flavor
was
crisp
and
clean
there
were
mild
citrus
notes
and
the
finish
was
plesantly
bitter
hopfish
is
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
it
went
down
very
smooth
a
very
good
beer
in
my
opinion
more
of
an
apa
but
still
enjoyable
i
want
more
glad
to
know
this
is
more
or
less
local
i
plan
to
pick
up
a
case
of
the
sn
torpedo
and
compare
drinkability
great
long
lasting
finish
that
leaves
you
wanting
another
sip
a
pretty
good
ipa
with
rich
tasting
hops
and
worth
another
look
for
sure
overall
this
was
a
nice
drinking
ipa
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
give
my
friends
who
are
hesitant
of
trying
ipas
because
it
has
that
slight
bitterness
to
it
complimented
by
the
hops
which
helps
introduce
a
novice
to
them
without
turning
them
off
sessionable
but
why
would
you
overall
not
impressed
d
mild
enough
to
go
down
easy
very
light
amber
more
so
yellow
in
hue
quite
clear
with
thick
and
active
bubbles
and
huge
dense
head
of
foam
the
nose
comprised
of
grapefruit
dried
white
fruits
mild
floral
swipes
neither
really
malty
nor
hoppy
light
presence
with
strong
persistence
not
heaviness
mediumbodied
rich
foaminess
makes
it
feel
heavier
until
the
suds
subside
nonthreateningly
bitter
serves
up
grapefruit
to
orange
zest
sweet
spices
and
mild
fruitiness
stays
consistent
without
any
dips
nor
crests
in
keeping
has
a
calm
and
collected
finish
very
smooth
rich
while
easy
to
keep
sipping
for
an
ipa
this
one
goes
down
easy
there
is
some
bitterness
but
like
blue
points
hoptical
illusion
it
isnt
overpowering
you
could
taste
the
hops
in
the
beer
so
overall
this
ipa
is
great
because
the
bitterness
is
not
too
prevalent
in
the
beer
i
strongly
encourage
a
friend
or
two
to
session
this
beer
local
brewery
for
me
but
i
was
really
disappointed
really
weak
hop
flavor
for
an
ipa
really
not
on
the
caliber
of
the
better
ipas
not
a
bad
brew
but
there
are
so
many
better
ipas
out
there
that
this
one
is
made
pretty
much
worthless
this
wasnt
my
style
of
ipa
a
decent
beer
i
guess
but
thin
and
sweet
thanks
for
the
chance
kenny
drinkability
would
consider
this
a
session
ipa
highly
drinkable
but
not
light
on
hops
or
taste
if
you
are
looking
for
an
ipa
to
kick
your
tastebuds
ass
this
aint
it
d
there
is
just
enough
hops
to
make
this
a
summer
quencher
session
ipa
though
drinks
more
like
a
pale
d
tasty
sure
but
this
really
drinks
more
like
a
pale
ale
unfortunately
its
maltforward
profile
overshadows
the
hop
bitterness
that
isnt
to
say
that
hop
fish
is
a
bad
brew
its
just
not
quite
to
style
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
again
but
if
it
showed
up
in
a
box
on
my
doorstep
i
would
place
it
immediately
into
the
fridge
for
consumption
d
nice
session
aipa
i
really
enjoyed
this
as
a
middle
of
the
session
ipa
nothing
over
the
top
but
very
drinkable
decent
beer
but
definitely
not
an
american
ipa
in
my
opinion
the
smell
was
of
fresh
respberries
and
the
taste
was
so
syrupy
sweet
tasted
like
raspberries
over
and
over
then
i
looked
at
the
beer
menu
and
saw
that
they
had
a
raspberry
beer
on
tap
perhaps
the
glasses
arent
properly
cleaned
in
between
customers
i
would
try
this
beer
again
but
not
because
it
was
great
just
to
see
if
it
was
really
raspberry
or
not
mediocore
very
drinkable
but
definitely
could
use
more
hops
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
flying
fish
american
pint
glass
this
flying
fish
poured
a
clear
amber
that
had
a
fizzy
white
head
of
foam
that
was
about
12
inch
in
height
it
didnt
take
long
for
this
fizzy
head
of
foam
to
completely
fizzle
away
into
a
few
bubbly
islands
and
a
handful
of
white
rings
along
the
edge
it
had
a
medium
sized
aroma
of
tea
mix
toasted
malts
caramel
citrus
hops
and
a
slight
pinch
of
grapefruit
the
taste
started
off
with
lightly
toasted
malts
and
then
out
of
nowhere
the
taste
shot
into
the
hoppycrispy
side
of
the
beer
that
side
of
the
beer
was
filled
with
citrus
fruits
caramel
citrus
hops
a
small
slice
of
grapefruit
and
some
pine
needles
at
the
finish
it
was
a
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
nice
crispy
aftertaste
of
citrus
hops
grapefruit
and
a
slight
touch
of
toasted
malts
not
the
hoppiest
ipa
out
there
but
it
would
make
for
a
nice
lightly
hoppy
session
ipa
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
one
again
in
the
future
one
of
the
better
flying
fish
beers
d
fell
quickly
not
one
of
the
elites
but
a
fine
ipa
sessionable
even
d
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
thanks
anyway
alan
a
clear
red
amber
with
a
big
white
head
and
spotty
lace
it
has
a
fairly
herbal
aroma
with
some
spicey
wheat
malt
and
a
touch
of
lemon
the
taste
seems
to
take
on
more
of
a
floral
hops
with
good
bitterness
and
an
odd
sweet
malt
it
is
tangy
with
a
spritely
carbonation
and
the
body
is
kind
of
light
but
there
is
a
touch
of
welcome
viscocity
quite
drinkable
if
the
bitterness
doesnt
overwhelm
a
bit
an
interesting
grassywheat
edge
may
not
meet
everyones
approval
but
its
at
least
passable
ipa
territory
a
little
better
i
think
id
rate
it
higher
as
an
english
ipa
but
not
much
there
was
something
about
this
beer
that
i
cannot
put
my
finger
on
that
i
did
not
enjoy
as
a
whole
this
was
a
solid
brew
but
it
wasnt
really
exceptionally
in
any
sense
it
was
kind
of
just
a
mediocre
ipa
to
me
that
could
have
been
something
more
i
was
not
disappointed
but
i
also
wasnt
thrilled
pours
a
clear
orange
amber
with
a
massive
head
off
a
very
firm
pour
and
the
head
sticks
around
too
metallic
acorn
nose
but
very
subdued
flavor
is
a
bit
woody
and
a
bit
too
sweet
imo
seems
to
calm
down
on
the
sweetness
as
i
move
on
caramellike
apple
tones
are
also
there
feel
is
good
nice
carbonation
and
a
good
liquid
feel
overall
seems
a
bit
too
tangy
to
be
able
to
down
more
than
one
in
a
go
well
worth
trying
it
just
seems
like
the
edges
are
a
bit
too
rough
d
refreshing
enjoyable
drinkable
d
this
is
good
beer
but
there
are
a
lot
better
examples
of
the
style
i
do
like
the
malty
backbone
though
taste
mild
hop
bitter
with
model
hop
flavor
all
amid
a
sea
of
malt
sweetness
soured
caramel
and
cheesy
hop
aged
not
the
most
pleasing
experience
mouthfeel
is
thick
which
would
be
good
to
the
flavors
around
if
they
were
pleasant
incredible
lacing
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
drinkability
you
could
have
a
few
in
one
sitting
however
i
wouldnt
try
it
again
this
is
a
decent
attempt
and
has
something
going
for
it
but
not
enough
to
it
to
cover
up
minor
flawsdrawbacks
too
thin
for
the
style
though
it
is
easy
enough
to
get
through
a
couple
of
these
not
high
on
my
list
of
ipas
very
light
yet
has
decent
substance
with
almost
a
belgian
spicey
quality
on
the
finish
same
tropical
notes
with
little
caramel
malt
not
overly
complex
but
a
beer
that
is
easily
drinkable
hmm
seems
to
have
more
of
a
english
ipa
malt
profile
a
strong
almost
boozy
but
light
caramel
malt
with
fruity
american
hops
overall
not
a
bad
ipa
just
not
the
most
complex
it
gets
points
for
balance
i
suppose
as
theres
a
pleasant
maltiness
but
the
almost
sweet
grapefruit
hops
are
just
on
par
for
an
ipa
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
in
a
tough
field
d
it
is
alright
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
but
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
pours
a
clear
copper
hue
with
a
nice
two
finger
white
head
that
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
that
lasts
throughout
smell
is
an
enjoyable
blend
of
grassy
dirt
hops
caramel
malt
and
a
sweet
cornlike
odor
i
like
it
a
lot
flavor
doesnt
exactly
match
up
to
the
smell
which
in
this
case
is
a
bad
thing
much
more
dull
on
the
tongue
with
an
initial
pine
hop
that
fades
to
a
dull
topsoillike
flavor
aftertaste
is
a
caramelcitrus
blend
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
creamy
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
decent
beer
just
nothing
ill
seek
out
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
flavor
starts
with
an
acidic
almost
lemony
hop
kick
sharp
bitterness
lightly
malty
i
wish
i
would
have
picked
this
beer
up
a
month
ago
it
would
have
been
a
great
summer
beer
refreshing
light
with
enough
of
a
hops
kick
to
remind
you
youre
drinking
an
ipa
but
not
too
much
that
you
cant
taste
a
thing
for
the
rest
of
the
night
a
different
and
welcomed
approach
to
a
classic
style
not
a
bad
ipa
but
unremarkable
worth
a
shot
overall
a
pretty
easy
to
drink
ipa
with
a
respectable
abv
the
flavor
is
a
bit
lacking
however
the
beer
pours
a
nice
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
wonderfully
balanced
aroma
that
boasts
of
pale
bisquit
and
carapils
malts
along
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
bitter
flavor
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
hoppy
with
some
light
bisquit
flavor
the
palate
is
dominated
with
hops
but
the
pale
malts
add
to
a
well
rounded
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
its
pretty
standard
american
ipa
but
it
drinks
well
this
is
a
good
session
beer
even
at
6
3
d
definitely
a
bit
odd
but
quite
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
mind
havent
some
more
of
this
one
the
drinkability
is
average
at
best
for
the
style
mk
pours
a
clear
pale
amber
color
with
a
shallow
off
white
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
spotty
lacing
generated
the
smell
is
faint
but
you
can
get
flora
hops
medium
bodied
the
mouth
feel
is
well
carbonated
and
a
nice
hop
character
lends
a
nice
extra
side
of
things
the
flavor
is
mild
with
a
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
but
it
finishes
with
a
piny
breath
that
lingers
appropriately
a
reasonable
drinker
i
will
certainly
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
sixer
it
seems
like
this
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
although
6
3
abv
is
on
the
edge
d
a
decent
beer
through
and
through
i
could
spend
an
evening
drinking
this
o
crisp
light
and
refreshing
ipa
not
as
hoppy
as
others
lacks
the
overall
hop
punch
that
other
ipas
have
overall
i
really
enjoy
flying
fishs
hopfish
its
the
perfect
blend
of
hops
and
malts
that
makes
one
of
the
better
balanced
beers
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
i
look
forward
to
trying
another
one
of
their
beers
soon
possibly
the
belgian
dopple
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
some
sticky
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
malty
sweet
and
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
basically
no
trace
of
hopscitrus
and
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
but
a
different
ipa
to
me
this
beer
has
definite
session
potential
while
not
groundbreaking
it
is
a
solid
brew
in
its
own
right
and
offers
a
nice
style
example
insomuch
as
it
shows
that
just
because
its
an
ipa
doesnt
mean
it
has
to
be
dominated
by
hops
quite
enjoyable
on
a
lovely
spring
afternoon
such
as
this
d
very
tasty
goes
down
easily
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
although
i
like
a
little
more
flavor
in
my
ipas
and
there
are
others
that
id
choose
in
the
style
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
could
go
with
for
a
long
time
d
ive
been
consistently
and
unexpectedly
impressed
with
flying
fish
beers
especially
given
that
ive
been
consistently
underwhelmed
with
the
counterpart
magic
hat
this
one
is
solid
not
the
best
hoppy
ipa
ive
ever
had
but
definitely
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
solid
flavor
that
i
could
drink
for
a
little
while
this
poured
a
very
clear
orange
colour
with
an
offwhite
head
about
an
inch
high
lacing
immediately
formed
as
the
head
slowly
fell
a
little
clumpy
and
thick
but
not
a
great
quantity
citrusy
hops
were
evident
as
soon
as
the
bottle
was
cracked
grapefruit
and
sweet
tarts
for
the
most
part
a
little
grassy
too
very
grassy
hop
flavour
with
some
grapefruit
and
pine
resin
backing
bit
of
malt
and
moderate
bitterness
quite
fruity
actually
with
a
bit
of
spice
in
the
finish
lingering
hops
medium
body
and
carbonation
not
bad
but
the
choice
of
hops
doesnt
quite
work
for
me
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
double
ipa
that
a
bunch
of
us
made
a
while
back
i
think
the
centennial
version
overall
i
was
disappointed
after
finally
trying
this
one
lack
of
full
robust
hop
flavoring
common
in
ipas
left
me
wanting
i
may
try
it
again
on
tap
somewhere
if
only
to
support
the
local
economy
this
is
a
nice
quaffable
beer
it
certainly
strikes
the
balance
between
quaffability
and
hop
character
that
should
define
the
style
it
is
not
one
of
the
more
aggressive
versions
of
the
style
but
never
fear
it
is
still
enjoyable
and
hoppy
enough
for
all
but
the
seriously
hopderanged
overallnot
my
favorite
ipa
but
certainly
very
good
at
the
price
point
i
could
easily
make
it
a
staple
in
my
fridge
when
i
tried
this
beer
back
in
august
on
tap
my
thoughts
were
i
was
disappointed
by
this
beer
as
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
a
nice
ipa
i
may
try
it
again
but
not
anytime
soon
now
four
months
later
and
on
cask
i
find
it
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
be
happy
to
have
again
not
sure
why
the
big
difference
just
glad
i
took
a
second
chance
on
it
thanks
jb
a
solid
beer
i
did
not
pour
it
but
rather
drank
right
out
of
bottle
so
i
cant
really
judge
the
appearance
the
smell
and
the
taste
were
both
sufficently
hoppy
without
being
over
powering
this
created
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
with
an
execlent
mouthfeel
if
you
like
ipas
this
is
most
certainly
a
good
beer
to
try
dont
drink
and
review
drinkability
really
more
of
an
english
style
than
an
american
this
beer
is
wellbalanced
and
flavorful
just
not
what
you
expect
from
an
american
ipa
cheers
sure
could
have
a
few
of
these
cloudy
glowing
orange
gold
short
sand
colored

of
mixed
size
bubbles
with
some
staying
power
that
eventually
settles
leaving

of
carbonation
hit
the
surface
light
orange
blossom
and
caramel
aromas
mixed
some
rind
notes
are
present
but
nothing
overly
ipadistinct
the
flavor
starts
with
a
light
citrus
rind
element
supported
by
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
finishes
citrus
juice

orange
and
lemon

tart
and
sweet
with
a
minimal
amount
of
hop
bite
a
lemon
juice
tone
overlays
it
all
and
the
finish
is
short
thankfully
as
this
became
less
drinkable
as
it
warmed
ever
so
slightly
mediumlight
body
with
a
flaccid
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
makes
this
barely
tolerable
utterly
unenjoyable
with
a
preponderance
of
lemon
rindjuice
flavors
a
disappointment
while
not
flawed
nor
is
it
interesting
while
the
name
hopfish
calls
to
mind
other
locals
like
hop
devil
hop
wallop
hops
infusion
and
hop
hog
its
more
in
line
with
cricket
hills
hopnotic
ipa
a
self
described
training
wheel
ipa
not
a
spectacular
ipa
but
worth
a
look
contains
the
wrong
hop
profile
for
my
tastes
and
even
with
its
malt
presence
not
truly
balanced
a
likeable
mildish
ipa
good
stuff
tastes
of
spicy

and
is
very

i
cannot
distinguish
what
type

not

ipa
this
one
i
got
may
be
a
little
older
and
had
some
hops
mellow
out
but
it
reminds
me
more
of
an
esb
than
ipa
anyway
it
is
quite
nice
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
a

and
very
much
in

what
youd
expect
from
an

ipa
not
bad
if
youre
looking
for
a
fairly
tame

certainly
better
than

not

without

and
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
touch
froathy
for
some
reason
this
reminds
me
of
the
otter

copper
ale
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
guess
ipa
on
cask
at
the
grey
lodge
in
ne
philly
i
had
a
sample
of
this
after
thinking
it
was
the
puckerfish
i
was
disappointed
to
not
be
able
to
try
the
puckerfish
but
the
hopfish
is
also
a
nice
beer
the
beer
poured
a
nice
golden
amber
color
with
a
slight
head
the
aroma
is
of
strong
hops
with
a
bit
of
fruitness
and
malts
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
hop
bomb
but
it
balanced
out
well
with
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
with
a
medium
body
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
from
what
i
had
sampled
draft
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
white
head
that
produces
good
lacing
and
lasts
well
has
a
very
hoppy
aroma
of
pine
and
citrus
has
light
body
with
a
good
carbination
the
flavor
is
nicely
hoppy
but
not
overbearing
has
a
good
mouthfeel
a
nice
duration
with
a
good
bitter
finish
a
very
tasty
ipa
not
bad
not
great
simple
enough
and
true
to
the
style
my
personal
preference
is
a
bit
hoppier
as
this
one
leans
more
to
the
malt
side
not
bad
and
easy
suds
drinkin
medium
bodied
with
slightly
more
carbonation
on
the
mouth
than
expected
i
found
it
quite
drinkable
from
what
i
understand
this
one
will
be
available
year
round
it
will
make
several
trips
out
at
the
shore
attempting
to
catch
all
jerseys
fish
it
drinks
pretty
easy
i
could
have
a
lot
of
these
id
say
itd
be
a
good
beer
to
get
a
case
of
for
a
barbeque
or
something
nothing
too
special
picked
a
six
pack
of
this
up
just
because
one
day
in
need
of
a
tasty
session
beer
this
is
a
good
one
folks
its
clean
hoppy
yet
not
overly
so
it
was
floral
will
not
alot
of
bitter
hop
smell
poured
almost
amber
into
my
glass
with
a
decent
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
while
the
taste
was
of
a
normal
ipa
yet
there
seamed
to
be
alittle
more
sweet
malts
that
gave
it
some
small
fruit
notes
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
satistfying
and
even
refreshing
alittle
stickire
of
an
ipa
ive
had
the
aftertaste
is
not
lingering
at
all
though
id
say
this
beer
is
definatley
very
drinkable
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
this
one
in
summer
drinkability
average
in
my
book
as
this
ipa
doesnt
excite
me
at
all
overall
the
flavor
tones
are
mild
and
need
to
be
kicked
up
a
bit
there
are
many
other
ipas
much
better
i
wouldnt
bother
with
this
btw
the
lacing
just
never
gives
up
got
a
quality
pour
with
this
brew
big
foamy
head
with
lots
of
pretty
and
stringy
lace
nice
amber
color
nose
is
hops
with
some
prety
nice
hops
wafting
out
flavor
is
a
nice
hop
bomb
but
not
so
much
as
to
ruin
other
later
tastings
great
floral
flavors
with
some
grapefruit
and
just
hints
of
christmas
bits
of
caramel
and
some
honey
too
the
hops
left
me
smacking
my
lips
nice
heft
on
this
beer
with
a
very
pleasant
dry
finish
slightly
oily
though
great
carbonation
just
enough
to
lighten
this
beer
on
the
tongue
and
to
keep
the
dry
qualities
from
tiring
out
my
tongue
ill
tell
you
it
certainly
looks
damned
pretty
and
while
the
smell
and
taste
dont
quite
deliver
what
you
hope
for
it
doesnt
fall
short
by
much
the
abv
is
manageable
and
while
the
elements
dont
blend
so
much
as
trade
places
at
least
theyre
there
and
identifiable
one
of
the
better
offerings
ive
sampled
from
flying
fish
id
have
no
issues
with
having
this
again
when
given
the
opportunity
ive
never
been
overly
impressed
with
flying
fish
and
i
hesitated
to
order
this
surprisingly
though
its
a
wonderful
offering
cloudy
golden
in
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
left
solid
lacing
behind
smelled
fruity
and
malty
with
just
enough
floral
hops
taste
was
quite
similar
juicy
fruit
flavors
coupled
with
floral
hops
and
a
bittering
that
grows
and
grows
and
consumes
the
mouth
requiring
another
juicy
sip
from
its
drinker
mouth
is
full
smooth
and
creamy
yet
quite
delicate
really
enjoyable
stuff
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
it
again
soon
look
for
this
beer
on
draft
at
bars
around
the
philly
area
and
give
it
a
shot
if
you
see
it
flying
fish
is
waiting
to
see
what
the
response
is
before
they
decide
whether
or
not
to
bottle
it
for
the
unfiltered
unclear
homemade
iced
tea
towards
amber
maybe
more
the
color
of
a
longisland
iced
tea
cannot
see
my
fingers
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
just
a
bit
of
mediumlarge
white
bubbles
at
the
edges
of
the
glass
and
a
light
dusting
semi
soured
scents
alliteration
anyone
cant
really
feel
the
carbonation
in
this
version
but
yet
it
doesnt
feel
flat
more
like
i
am
drinking
a
cold
caskconditioned
i
like
low
carbonation
so
this
is
good
very
smooth
and
low
to
medium
bodied
nicely
hoppy
grapefruit
and
biteyness
tastes
of
gin
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
almost
honeylike
lots
of
flavor
going
on
easy
drinker
smooth
as
silk
a
very
good
session
ipa
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
there
are
better
choices
within
the
style
o
very
well
done
great
amber
color
this
beer
tries
to
go
for
the
english
style
ipa
but
seems
to
have
too
much
of
an
american
taste
at
first
sip
it
tastes
great
but
the
after
taste
is
very
bitter
the
verdict
not
bad
good
herbal
flavors
but
a
bit
bland
and
heavy
on
the
bitter
far
from
being
one
of
victorys
best
but
its
hard
to
find
anything
by
them
out
here
on
the
left
coast
so
im
savoring
it
just
the
same
o
pleasant
this
bottle
was
a
good
other
than
not
having
a
great
head
this
beer
smalls
and
tastes
great
the
hops
are
bright
and
clean
for
english
hops
well
made
in
imo
im
surprised
at
the
low
ratings
others
have
given
this
o
if
it
wasnt
for
the
grassy
finish
i
will
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
feel
this
beer
is
a
miss
for
me
i
still
cant
wait
to
try
the
next
moving
parts
pretty
good
kept
picking
up
a
wintergreen
flavor
at
the
beginning
a
very
interesting
english
pale
drinkable
by
the
gallon
in
my
book
pretty
classic
look
and
aroma
but
the
flavor
is
something
very
different
beyond
simply
the
addition
of
more
hops
than
the
english
ones
usually
have
more
than
just
bitterness
but
before
the
hoppy
finish
there
is
something
else
almost
a
spice
profile
i
literally
taste
cinnamon
and
clove
in
the
middle
of
the
malt
center
here
it
only
flashes
in
for
a
second
but
its
a
little
sweet
and
does
something
interesting
for
the
beer
brings
richness
out
of
the
grain
and
brings
spice
and
zestiness
out
of
the
hops
not
sure
if
its
actually
spiced
or
not
but
it
certainly
seems
that
way
to
me
but
its
gone
before
the
finish
the
yeast
profile
is
minimal
hard
to
even
pick
it
as
english
for
me
with
all
the
other
flavors
going
on
but
this
is
really
good
and
its
really
cheap
im
so
glad
we
have
fuller
victory
distribution
here
in
colorado
now
i
have
wanted
these
beers
for
a
long
time
all
of
their
stuff
so
its
fun
getting
in
to
them
a
little
bit
under
5
bucks
is
a
steal
for
a
bomber
of
this

b
light
on

is
typical

beers
a
bit
of

finish
just
a
so
so
ipa
there
was
very
low
aroma
on
the
glass
i
had
also
the
bitterness
balance
with
the
sweetness
was
a
little
off
putting
for
me
the
cask
serving
may
have
held
back
the
look
it
lacked
the
bubbly
the
style
please
me
and
this
is
no
exception
this
one
is
just
not
for
me
this
is
really
interesting
american
version
of
the
english
ipa
i
hope
this
style
might
attract
more
domestic
brewers
to
try
a
hoppy
but
less
bitter
quaff
than
the
current
session

crowd

the
22

this

if
youre
looking
for
an
englishstyled

then
you
should
definitely
pick
this
up
and
its
priced
well
at

99
a
bomber
id
like
to
see
this
in
6
packs
in
the
future
the
taste
is
very
good
with
prominent
hop
flavor
with
both
herbal
and
floral
qualities
and
slightly
toasted
taste
and
mildly
sweet
malt
flavor
to
support
but
still
more
hop
forward
with
dry
flavor
of
yeast
and
tangy
fruit
in
the
middle
with
a
subtle
citrus
hop
flavor
melding
in
the
english
hop
profile
with
a
subtle
apple
tanginess
in
the
yeast
which
compliments
the
flavor
the
quality
of
malt
hops
and
yeast
is
really
noticeable
and
the
ale
seems
drysemibitter
with
fruity
flavor
not
quite
grassy
in
the
hop
flavor
but
certainly
lots
of
herbal
hop
taste
which
is
lingering
in
a
pleasant
finish
very
good
ipa
an
excellent
example
of
an
english
style
ale
with
what
i
imagine
a
fresh
one
would
taste
like
from
across
the
pond
this
has
a
nice
fresh
hop
presence

good
english
flavors
w

body
sufficient
yet
not
excessive
kudos
victory
overall
this
beer
is
a
pima
pils
with
english
malts
and
i
love
it
o
a
good
beer
but
not
sure
you
would
know
it
was
an
ipa
if
it
didt
not
say
so
little
to
no
hops
easy
drinking
not
what
i
was
expecting
though
overall
surprised
by
the
relative
balance
here
in
an
eipa
that
is
as
much
about
the
malts
as
it
is
about
the
hops
perhaps
even
moreso
i
would
like
to
see
more
earthy
bitterness
here
than
i
found
but
the
malt
finally
gives
way
with
the
beers
waning
moments
and
allows
the
resinous
bitterness
of
hops
to
cast
a
barklike
woodiness
freshly
shaven
pine
sharpness
and
a
pithy
grapefruit
rind
bitterness
that
easily
outlasts

very

tasting
like

smooth

but
not
crazy
about
it
this
is
a
fine
effort
but
nothing
extraordinary
o
this
is
a
solid
enough
beer
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
it
is
likeable
in
its
way
o
unlike
any
ipa
ive
ever
had
english
or
american
has
a
flavor
profile
that
i
dont
necessarily
prefer
but
i
find
quite
interesting
kudos
to
victory
for
managing
to
brew
an
ipa
thats
totally
original
moving
parts
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
slightly
hazy
copper
coloring
with
a
slow
steady
flow
of
carbonation
throughout
the
body
and
a
low
profile
fluffy
chunky
offwhite
head
aromas
of
tropical
fruit
forward
roasted
caramel
pepper
spice
and
bitter
greens
apple
sweet
and
hints
of
toffee
flavors
are
very
tangy
sweet
forward
with
a
blast
of
tart
apple
sweet
pear
some
tropical
fruit
notes
cut
grass
mild
bitterness
roasted
notes
some
melon
characteristics
and
a
subtle
caramel
backbone
smooth
and
light
bodied
with
a
tangy
fruity
aftertaste
fairly
dry
crisp
finish
with
a
subtle
resinous
linger
not
bad
this
was
a
nice
beer
herbal
and
piney
notes
dominate
the
hop
profile
with
a
sight
hint
of
orange
the
finish
has
a
reminiscence
of
tea
as
well
backed
by
a
nice
balance
of
malt
sweetness
this
was
an
interesting
beer
nothing
that
wows
but
it
is
well
made
has
good
flavor
and
depth
and
is
a
very
nice
interpretation
of
the
english
variety
of
ipa
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
and
very
approachable
great
for
watching
some
football
and
getting
the
food
cooking
on
a
warmer
mid
autumn
night
o
a
solid
englishstyle
ipa
with
a
good
amount
of
herbal
and
earthy
hops
with
just
enough
fruitiness
there
is
just
enough
crystal
malt
in
there
to
give
it
a
little
lively
sweetness
as
well
solid
job
on
this
version
of
the
everevolving
ipa
overall
i
liked
this
beer
its
not
wet
hop
beer
but
a
decent
english
ipa
i
would
get
it
again
overall
a
decent
ipa
overall
but
at
this
point
nothing
too
exceptional
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
it
changes
in
the
future
overall
enjoyable
english
hop
traditions
just
make
me
respect
the
american
way
even
more
though
it
was
so
easy
to
drink
so
good
and
so
reasonably
priced
i
gave
away
half
the
case
to
friends
and
went
back
to
victory
a
couple
days
later
to
get
two
more
cases
very
well
done
starts
like
a
good
ipa
finishes
with
malty
hops
almost
green
tea
like
finish
english
pub
feel
in
my
living
room
another
solid
offering
from
left
hand
who
is
quickly
moving
up
the
ladder
for
me
this
is
an
ipa
but
its
a
bit
maltier
and
less
bitter
than
traditional
ones
so
thats
why
i
liked
it
more
than
anticipated
im
not
sure
if
others
may
have
gotten
a
bad
batch
because
i
really
didnt
get
the
sour
or
bitter
taste
or
the
foul
aroma
that
some
reviews
have
described
ive
never
had
this
issue
with
left
hand
so
im
definitely
surprised
that
some
have
reviewed
this
beer
so
harshly
terrible
smelled
like
wet
towels
and
my
glasses
are
clean
so
i
dont
want
to
hear
that
shit
if
you
dont
like
this
beer
then
you
dont
know
good
english
beer
its
funky
but
thats
the
point
really
smooth
and
dry
love
it
looks
good
smells
good
tastes
horrible
so
sour
and
bitter
o
i
would
have
like
more
complexity
in
the
flavor
i
really
liked
it
yes
indeed
my
back
ground
was
shape
by
serving
20
years
in
the
us
air
force
this
allowed
me
to
travel
to
many
parts
of
the
us
and
overseas
to
sample
many
types
of
libations
and
to
develop
a
discerning
palate
its
a
really
really
good
ipa
its
just
not
my
type
of
beer
excellent
the
mouthfeel
and
nose
makes
for
an
awesome
twist
on
a
classic
beer
this
ones
a
little
different
has
a
caramel
flavor
with
a
smidge
of
toffee
flavor
which
im
not
a
fan
of
it
has
a
little
piney
aftertaste
that
lingers
longer
than
id
like
its
not
bad
but
i
probably
wont
rush
out
for
more
bitter
with
a
funky
bread
taste
a
very
good
beer
overall
and
it
much
better
than
i
had
expected
it
to
be
pretty
bitter
but
an
overall
great
beer
an
acquired
taste
tho
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
corey
ok
but
not
as
good
as
some
amber
color
with
thin
lingering
surface
bubbles
sweet
malt
folowed
by
moderate
fresh
hops
bitterness
medium
thick
body
fairly
smooth
a
solid
english
style
ipa
first
time
drinking
an
english
style
ipa
so
not
sure
how
it
compares
but
i
really
like
this
beer
i
do
not
usually
like
ipas
that
much
they
are
way
too
overhopsy
for
my
taste
however
now
this
one
for
the
apalover
that
i
am
is
the
perfect
ipa
another
fantastic
beer
from
an
outstanding
brewery
this
is
an
average
beer
a
good
ipa
nice
bitter
taste
nice
feel
overall
ive
had
this
beer
before
but
i
guess
i
never
rated
it
not
a
bad
beer
i
think
part
of
the
reason
for
the
lower
ba
score
is
due
to
palate
being
use
to
american
style
ipas
at
least
i
found
myself
thrown
off
at
first
overall
extremely
enjoyable
not
too
heavy
that
the
more
elegant
qualities
of
its
taste
are
overwhelmed
for
a
twisted
thistle
fan
this
hit
the
spot
a
solid
but
not
extraordinary
beer
from
left
hand
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
but
this
beer
is
not
their
best
weighting
appearance
15

35

overall
20
o
taste
like
an
english

average
buzz
for

8
the
label
is
awesome
great
beer
this
beer
and
stones
ipa
helped
me
get
into
the
realm
of
ipas
the
nose
is
spice
earthy
hops
chives
not
much
malt
the
flavor
is
earthy
hops
with
a
malt
backbone
a
little
cotton
candy
spice
potato
this
is
old
school
ipa
but
not
a
great
interpretation
unfortunately
my
preferences
have
changed
and
this
doesnt
stand
out
like
i
am
sure
it
did
10
years
ago
this
was
good
but
not
as
good
as
i
thought
it
would
be
nice
malt
backbone
i
do
like
getting
some
malt
through
at
the
end
after
the
hops
come
at
the
beginning
and
thats
what
you
get
here
nice
lace
on
the
glass
yellow
brown
body
not
too
impressive
looking
overall
nice
carbonation
and
served
at
the
right
temperature
id
drink
this
again
very
smooth
good
with
a
burger
o
a
good
beer
but
i
was
disappointed
at
the
lack
of
malt
presence
usually
the
british
pale
ales
and
ipas
have
a
stronger
malt
backbone
i
taste
the
british
hops
in
this
beer
but
the
malt
is
sadly
not
present
its
decent
but
nothing
special
not
my
favorite
style
yeah
a
whole
lots
of
hops
bite
my
kind
of
ipa
o
a
nice
beer
ill
keep
an
eye
out
for
it
on
tap
where
i
think
an
enhanced
mouthfeel
will
accentuate
the
flavor
of
this
ale
overall
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
another
one
as
this
one
got
finished
quickly
in
a
pairing
with
vegetable
tikka
masala
overall
a
full
flavored
english
ipa
something
about
this
beer
its
all
man
its
lighter
in
feel
but
kind
of
brutal
in
flavor
its
a
little
challenging
for
a
beginner
or
a
brit
haha
weighty
with
bitterness
for
the
style
like
a
400pound
monkey
overall
a
decent
english
style
ipa
very
easy
drinking
i
would
buy
again
though
not
a
true
fan
of
the
style
overall
an
enjoyable
english
not
my
style
but
id
have
another
overall
i
love
this
ipa
drank
it
out
of
a
bottle
for
years
but
on
tap
is
the
way
to
go
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
nice
bubbly
head
slight
pine
bread
and
spice
smell
the
caramel
malt
really
comes
through
with
a
bit
of
fruit
in
the
background
a
nice
touch
of
bitter
aftertaste
a
mediumlight
mouth
with
some
carbonation
very
pleasant
overall
comes
across
a
little
like
an
oktoberfest
type
beer
not
a
eipa
an
okay
beer
but
not
really
fitting
of
the
style
i
wouldnt
pick
this
one
up
again
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
bubbly
head
light
lacing
nose
is
piney
with
a
distinct
sweetness
floral
hops
and
bitter
pecan
shell
bready
and
crisp
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
o
not
bad
id
drink
this
one
again
2nd
time
around
liked
this
better
it
lacks
aroma
but
tastes
finishes
looks
great
strong
consistent
brewer
left
hand
try
them
all
when
i
first
tried
this
beer
i
didnt
like
it
ive
had
it
since
and
thought
that
my
first
impression
was
wrong
but
once
again
im
underwhelmed
by
400m
i
think
my
bottle
was
a
little
skunky
which
im
not
factoring
into
my
score
but
the
beer
also
just
doesnt
have
a
good
flavor
or
aroma
and
i
would
only
buy
this
again
if
i
had
to
to
choose
between
this
and
macro
lagers
c
i
guess
the
english
style
of
ipa
is
more
of
a
session
beer
than
the
american
version
had
on
tap
at
sunset
cantina
pours
a
very
hazy
golden
color
with
no
head
little
lacing
and
mildly
carbonated
not
much
of
a
smell
has
a
malty
lemon
smell
but
nothing
overwhelming
tastes
a
bit
sour
to
me
with
little
hops
in
the
traditional
style
a
bit
malty
taste
second
and
third
tatses
not
really
doing
it
for
me
with
this
one
final
thoughts
im
a
hop
head
but
englishstyle
ipas
tend
to
be
an
achilles
heel
of
mine
due
to
their
unappealing
hop
character
and
dry
bitterness
400
pound
monkey
on
the
other
hand
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
done
in
a
tasty
and
drinkable
way
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
opretty
solid
brew
and
highly
sessionable
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
it
out
but
wouldnt
pass
it
up
if
it
came
my
way
again
pours
medium
amber
with
a
off
white
head
tons
of
lacing
hanging
about
as
it
is
drank
the
aroma
is
filled
with
bread
malts
and
earthy
hops
lemon
and
grapefruit
also
sneak
their
way
into
the
nose
lots
of
grapefruit
and
orange
zest
up
front
in
the
taste
hints
of
toasted
caramel
malts
are
also
present
very
good
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
low
abv
makes
this
a
nice
drinker
one
of
the
better
eipa
ive
had
left
hand
brewing
400
pound
monkey
45
tried
this
beer
at
the
yard
house
in
downtown
denver
the
beer
poured
a
nice
color
with
a
moderate
head
it
smelled
good
with
a
slight
hoppy
aroma
though
not
overpowering
the
first
drink
was
light
and
underwhelming
typical
english
ipa
i
did
not
realize
it
was
an
english
ipa
when
i
tried
it
so
i
was
disappointed
with
the
lack
of
anything
approaching
hoppiness
in
the
first
taste
as
my
mouth
adjusted
it
turned
out
to
be
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
o
its
a
little
dull
on
all
fronts
but
all
the
english
character
im
looking
for
has
been
dumbed
down
or
is
altogether
not
there
just
not
a
lot
to
grab
the
palates
attention
a
very
drab
offering
light
bright
and
crisp
the
body
offers
up
some
creaminess
but
is
a
little
thin
into
the
middle
d
classic
ipa
o
this
is
definitely
a
unique
beer
that
seems
like
a
hybrid
between
a
tripel
with
the
maltiness
and
sweetness
and
an
english
ipa
with
the
light
amount
of
bitterness
the
beer
hides
its
alcohol
well
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
sessionable
because
the
mouthfeel
seems
to
have
a
heavy
dose
of
malts
o
a
stronger
than
average
ipa
but
not
outstanding
except
for
its
name
worth
trying
and
ok
id
probably
rather
have
more
fruit
notes
and
less
pine
otoh
it
grew
on
me
somewhat
after
the
halfway
mark
o
well
done
english
ipa
must
try
again
a
decent
beer
an
odd
beer
if
you
like
dirty
beersbeers
that
have
bizarre
flavors
that
most
people
would
find
offputting
this
is
the
beer
for
you
the
initial
flavor
on
this
beer
is
strange
strange
strange
after
having
a
number
of
sips
and
working
my
way
down
the
glass
that
flavor
went
away
a
little
bit
but
im
not
forgetting
that
it
was
there
given
the
price
point
and
other
tasty
beers
left
hand
makes
for
the
same
price
point
im
not
sure
id
have
this
one
again
o
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
for
sure
so
creamy
smooth
and
malt
forward
but
enough
bitterness
and
hops
to
keep
it
true
to
its
style
just
really
excellent
i
want
this
on
cask
now
overall
im
not
too
familiar
with
englishstyle
ales
of
any
form
in
general
it
was
slightly
above
average
fairly
decent
it
had
a
nice
look
and
the
taste
wasnt
overbearing
in
anyway
overall
pretty
tasty
eipa
i
could
have
a
few
more
o
an
english
ipa
with
a
twist
and
a
bit
more
character
than
usual
but
still
perfectly
balanced
and
drinkable
very
nice
o
would
drink
this
beer
again
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
probably
would
not
buy
it
again
unless
on
sale
i
like
ipas
and
i
like
left
hand
brews
for
the
most
part
this
beer
was
a
big
disappointment
however
im
glad
i
only
had
a
few
bottles
from
a
variety
pack
pours
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
virtually
no
aroma
hops
are
quite
subdued
and
malt
takes
front
and
center
in
a
weak
way
theres
something
in
the
flavor
that
i
just
cant
put
my
finger
on
but
i
really
dont
like
it
theres
really
nothing
about
this
brew
to
latch
on
to
as
a
saving
grace
i
cant
recommend
it
flavors
of
grassy
hops
malts
white
grapefruit
rind
minerals
slight
burnt
toast
overall
quite
flavorful
with
good
body
and
a
bitter
semidry
finish
the
taste
begins
sweet
and
bready
and
the
hops
are
more
in
in
the
background
subtle
and
balancing
i
always
liked
the
english
ipa
over
the
american
ipa
because
its
not
in
my
face
bitter
and
left
hand
captures
those
subtleties
well
easy
for
me
to
drink
and
enjoy
the
beer
had
a
nice
head
on
it
and
had
more
malt
aroma
than
i
was
expecting
a
bit
of
earthy
hop
character
was
in
there
as
well
its
an
english
style
ipa
something
not
pointed
out
on
the
menu
so
i
adjusted
my
expectation
of
hop
character
even
still
the
balance
seemed
to
be
more
towards
the
malt
rather
than
the
hop
in
addition
the
elements
of
the
beer
seemed
flatter
on
flavor
than
i
would
have
hoped
kind
of
like
the
beer
had
traveled
all
the
way
from
england
in
reality
it
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
overall
a
slightly
aboveaverage
ipa
not
my
favorite
left
hand
but
a
nice
english
ipa
id
drink
it
again
but
i
probably
wouldnt
try
too
hard
to
find
this
one
o
decent
english
ipa
but
nothing
special
flavors
are
good
but
bitterness
seemed
a
bit
on
the
high
end
for
my
preference
o
its
an
ok
english
ipa
at
best
this
is
the
only
think
i
can
recall
having
from
left
hand
but
it
lacks
in
the
flavor
department
big
time
and
the
dry
bitterness
is
not
pleasing
to
the
taste
buds
a
murky
burnt
orange
body
holds
an
off
white
head
that
recedes
to
thick
film
good
webby
lacing
remains
i
smell
very
faint
caramel
before
diving
into
a
really
pure
viny
almost
grassy
hop
aroma
the
beer
starts
off
slightly
sweet
on
the
palate
then
the
citric
bitter
hops
come
on
and
perform
well
theres
a
very
bright
bitter
finish
overall
this
has
some
balance
but
ultimately
the
bitter
hops
really
take
off
o
a
solid
beer
at
a
good
price
another
great
beer
from
lefthand
i
rated
this
beer
as
high
as
you
will
ever
see
me
rate
an
ipa
im
not
a
big
fan
of
ipas
or
hoppy
beers
but
i
did
quite
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
an
ipa
and
is
quite
hoppy
for
my
taste
but
it
has
more
to
offer
than
just
bitterness
it
is
fairly
fruity
and
bready
and
has
a
very
hazy
appearance
i
probably
wont
buy
another
6
pack
but
will
continue
to
throw
one
into
the
pick
six
from
time
to
time
this
beer
reminded
me
a
lot
of
newcastle
but
a
touch
better
and
went
down
smoother
fish
taste
could
be
yeast
but
then
who
would
make
a
beer
with
such
an
awful
taste
and
charge
2
per
bottle
in
a
12pack
this
is
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
so
who
knows
it
actually
looks
fairly
decent
minus
the
floaties
until
you
try
to
drink
it
overall
a
pretty
nice
english
style
ipa
its
on
the
drier
side
with
a
good
blend
of
citrus
earthy
and
herbal
hop
well
worth
a
try
hayward
abbey
rating
68
overall
this
is
a
not
overpowering
ipa
thats
just
a
little
flat
on
taste
400monkey
pours
a
nice
golden
with
a
little
cloudiness
the
smell
is
hoppy
with
hints
of
sweet
caramel
it
pretty
bitter
at
first
but
finishes
up
smooth
this
beer
is
a
good
ipa
for
when
you
dont
want
all
that
hppiness
its
very
drinkable
and
makes
for
a
good
alternative
to
stronger
ipas
i
almost
feel
like
this
would
be
a
great
starter
ipa
is
you
were
trying
to
turn
someone
on
to
them
o
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
o
not
bad
but
forgettable
ive
enjoyed
every
beer
from
left
hand
but
expected
more
on
this
one
overall
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
but
interesting
enough
since
i
dont
get
many
english
ipas
would
i
buy
it
again
yes
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
summer
night
o
this
is
an
american
style
ipa
so
there
is
not
going
to
be
a
punch
of
anything
really
this
beer
is
evenly
blended
with
hops
and
citrus
that
may
be
intended
for
someone
experimenting
or
beginning
in
the
style
nothing
really
wows
me
about
this
beer
but
it
is
pretty
tasty
o
overall
i
liked
this
better
than
summit
ipa
this
was
toastier
and
had
a
better
aroma
apparently
this
needs
to
be
250
characters
long
so
i
will
try
to
autopsy
this
beer
it
is
supposedly
an
ipa
but
any
hop
flavor
has
been
murdered
and
left
for
dead
by
a
terrible
roasted
nutty
flavor
imagine
a
strange
mix
of
garlic
the
scent
of
a
wet
ashtray
and
candied
macadamia
i
understand
diversity
in
style
perhaps
if
someone
really
likes
nuts
and
chocolateburned
flavors
and
has
a
genetic
defect
in
their
taste
buds
this
is
for
them
but
it
is
not
an
ipa
and
it
tastes
terrible
id
get
a
six
pack
sometime
down
the
road
i
poured
this
average
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
an
amber
color
as
i
guess
it
should
have
been
the
head
was
decent
at
first
but
went
away
pretty
fast
the
beer
had
decent
to
good
lacing
smell
was
hoppy
which
was
strange
for
an
amber
taste
was
hoppy
with
bitter
finish
did
not
like
the
beer
and
will
not
buy
again
pours
hazy
orange
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
the
beer
is
more
malty
then
hoppy
keeping
to
the
tradition
of
the
english
style
ipa
the
hops
are
still
there
however
some
fresh
citrus
notes
and
a
slight
pine
caramel
and
toffee
compliment
the
hops
well
traditional
english
style
malts
make
this
a
unique
ipa
this
is
a
good
ipa
and
a
definite
change
of
pace
from
the
american
style
that
im
used
to
tasty
too
its
modestly
herbal
with
citrus
and
pineapple
notes
still
at
a
few
parts
the
beer
doesnt
totally
come
together
to
justify
a
higher
score
regardless
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
an
enjoyable
level
of
crispness
and
goes
out
as
an
honest
ipa
in
conclusion
it
isnt
the
greatest
but
it
isnt
bad
either
and
it
makes
a
good
choice
for
those
who
are
less
receptive
to
the
ipa
style
a
decent
traditional
ipa
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
hop
bitterness
and
not
enough
malt
flavor
overall
but
i
still
like
this
beer
i
definitely
would
sit
down
and
gladly
quaff
another
glass
or
two
of
this
brew
when
in
an
ipaframe
of
of
mind
generally
a
good
ipa
thick
one
finger
head
slightly
malty
aroma
i
probably
wont
buy
this
beer
again
it
has
all
of
the
flavors
of
a
really
good
ipa
but
none
of
them
are
strong
enough
to
make
it
stand
out
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
give
to
my
busch
light
swilling
friends
as
an
introduction
into
the
joys
of
beer
snobbery

noticed
after

overall
this
is
a

well

very
easy
to

wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
fresher
next

quite
enjoyable
pours

golden

color
with
a

there
are
mild
scents
of
hops

hidden
amongst
the
mix
the
taste
has
a
good
hoppy
taste
but
the
bitterness
is
rather
mild
in
comparison
to
an
ipa
texture
is
smooth
and
mellow
as
i
pick
up
strains
of
yeast
citrus
and
bready
tones
perhaps
a
little
thin
but
delivers
a
nice
slightly
crisp
after
taste
an
easy
drinking
ipa
with
a
very
memorable
name
ive
had
this
beer
on
tap
twice
both
times
ive
felt
this
beer
was
really
bad
ive
had
this
style
before
and
enjoyed
it
i
just
dont
feel
like
this
beer
is
very
good
beyond
bitter
and
it
seemed
like
a
burned
rubber
taste
was
present
just
nothing
enjoyable
about
it
to
me
my
friend
also
felt
it
was
very
bad
overall
drinkability
a
nice
beer
that
i
dont
love
this
could
definitely
use
a
tweak
here
or
there
i
would
especially
love
to
see
the
flavors
amped
up
and
some
more
yeasty
carbonation
refreshing
its
an
english
ipa
so
i
wasnt
expecting
a
big
hop
presence
and
thats
what
i
got
a
densent
maltier
brew
of
the
english
tradition
o
just
on
the
average
in
my
opinion
not
bad
yet
nothing
standing
out
have
i
waited
too
much
before
drinking
it
i
wonder
35
o
the
bitterness
of
this
ipa
is
a
touch
too
much
i
love
hops
but
the
bitterness
is
a
little
less
than
desirable
there
is
a
taste
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
but
it
almost
ruins
the
beer
as
a
whole
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
one
that
would
be
on
my
go
to
list
good
carbonation
a
decent
ipa
overall
an
excellent
beer
definitely
worth
revisiting
overall
this
is
a
good
ipa
but
i
guess
you
would
have
to
be
more
into
this
style
personally
i
enjoy
the
stranger
in
all
categories
minus
the
mouthfeel
its
all
about
the
hops
here
baby
o
easy
drinker
that
is
good
for
a
few
a
more
laid
back
english
style
ipa
o
a
decent
eipa
but
nothing
special
it
is
just
lacking
something
in
the
way
of
the
hop
department
imo
definitely
recommended
for
a
hot
day

of
bitterness
up

somewhat
refreshing
finish
this
beer
is
a
beautiful
clear
deep
golden
color
the
head
is
white
and
long
lasting
nice
aroma
herbal
floral
and
hoppy
its
not
a
traditional
goldings
or
fuggle
smell
but
it
is
clean
and
hoppy
there
is
a
little
malt
sitting
behind
the
hop
smell
as
well
biscuity
and
bready
the
aroma
however
is
a
little
restrained
nice
flavor
great
balance
the
foretaste
is
sweet
quickly
balanced
by
a
firm
bitterness
that
lasts
long
into
the
finish
medium
in
body
nice
beer
a
gentle
easydrinking
british
style
ipa
sessionable
o
like
the
stranger
i
thought
this
was
a
fairly
average
english
ipa
a
little
bit
less
sweet
with
more
spices
easily
drinkable
but
nothing
that
stands
out
i
would
definitely
like
to
try
this
beer
a
little
bit
fresher
id
expect
it
to
be
a
little
bit
hopier
but
unfortunately
due
to
it
being
brewed
almost
across
the
country
and
it
being
sold
in
a
12pack
it
picked
up
a
little
bit
of
age
on
its
journey
still
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
not
bad
for
a
beer
in
a
variety
12pack
i
wouldnt
buy
a
6pack
of
this
but
would
maybe
consider
the
12pack
again
o
good
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
it
is
an
english
ipa
after
all
3
0
d
good
beer
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
at
all
and
that
is
just
about
a
must
given
how
many
ipas
are
out
there
o
a
little
too
strong
in
abv
to
be
a
sessionable
beer
it
was
still
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
probably
order
it
again

glad

this
is
a

example
of
the
style
from

but
a

in
my

this
is
an
outstanding
ipa
for
people
who
dont

o
very

everything

id
def
buy
this
again
i
can
see
myself
going
back
for
a
full
6pack
of
these
monkeys
o
it
is
possible
the
bottle
wasnt
up
to
snuff
although
it
wasnt
old
i
was
concerned
when
there
was
almost
no
head
at
the
pour
it
was
ok
but
not
particularly
good
however
i
would
give
it
another
try
with
a
different
bottle
or
on
tap
the
body
was
way
too
thin
for
the
style
i
expect
an
english
ipa
to
have
a
pleasantly
full
and
smooth
body
drinkability
was
good
enough
i
suppose
but
why
have
more
than
1
overall
not
a
good
representation
of

try
it
to
tick
it
otherwise
skip
it

nice
big

whatsoever
slight

bready
a

sweetness
some

easy

medium

more
of
a
golden
ale
than
an
ipa
or
pale
ale
i
see
it
is
listed
as
an
english
ipa
here
but
i
dont
know
if
that
was
intended
by
the
brewer
or
not
just
not
very
flavorful
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
light
orange
color
body
with
not
a
lot
of
head
to
it
and
not
a
lot
of
lace
either
the
smell
has
a
nice
hop
aroma
and
a
little
bit
of
citrus
the
taste
has
a
nice
up
front
hop
taste
and
then
a
little
bit
of
malt
comes
through
on
the
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
good
and
overall
this
is
a
good
ipa
overall
i
enjoyed
this
ipa
very
nice
flavor
with
a
solid
american
take
on
the
english
style
recommended
at
least
it
wasnt
a
400lb
monkey
terd
o
slightly
above
average
drinking
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
pretty
good
drinking
a
golden
and
pale
yellow
color
it
presents
more
like
a
pale
ale
than
your
standard
ipa
3
fingers
of
off
white
suds
with
exceptional
lacing
and
stick
hops
are
present
in
the
smell
but
it
is
overtaken
by
a
wonderful
smell
of
freshly
baked
bread
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
ipa
that
drinks
very
easy
it
has
nice
hop
components
and
a
nice
clean
finish
id
definitely
get
this
again
a
solid
craft
brew
really
enjoyed
this
from
the
left
hand
mixer
i
bought
and
i
was
very
hesitant
to
try
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
typical
ipa
whole
cone
chewer
to
share
with
the
drain
cheers
to
left
hand
on
another
solid
brew
in
a
fairly
solid
stable
of
beers
sorry
to
have
to
report
this
is
a
bad
brew
but
thats
pretty
much
all
there
is
to
say
based
on
appearance
and
general
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
it
had
potential
and
if
you
read
im
not
alone
in
this
negative
experience
just
avoid
this
and
drink
any
of
the
100s
of
others
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
a
little
different
than
other
ipas
ive
been
drinking
at
least
recently
almost
as
if
it
had
pinch
of
blonde
thrown
into
it
its
well
balanced
and
drinkable
check
it
out
its
certainly
worth
trying
eh
pours
a
very
clear
light
golden
color
with
nice
white
lacing
and
a
small
white
head
smells
like
an
english
malt
attack
and
thats
about
it
deep
though
layered
flavor
is
very
malty
taste
like
the
spent
grains
at
a
brewery
smell
has
a
bitter
finish
i
wouldnt
call
this
an
ipa
by
even
english
standards
but
whatever
feel
is
decent
heavier
than
it
looks
sturdy
abv
fine
carbonation
overall
im
just
not
impressed
here
pretty
pedestrian
brew
for
lefthand
thebeeralmanac
com
o
lacking
in
every
area
but
taste
this
beer
proves
that
taste
is
and
always
will
be
the
most
important
factor
with
other
characteristics
only
supporting
it
if
this
beer
had
better
aromas
and
was
carbonated
better
then
it
would
make
this
good
beer
a
great
beer
at
first
i
was
quite
turned
off
by
this
beer
because
straight
out
of
the
fridge
all
you
get
is
harsh
bitterness
with
no
malt
flavor
let
it
warm
up
some
however
and
you
will
be
rewarded
with
a
delicious
malty
and
hoppy
treat
unlike
a
lot
of
ipas
on
the
market
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
easy
going
and
refreshing
just
barely
coats
your
tongue
mainly
just
sliding
over
to
relieve
it
d
the
creepy
bugeyes
starting
at
me
as
i
drink
this
bottle
is
a
little
odd
otherwise
its
fair
going
down
400
pound
monkey
is
a
good
english
ipa
that
im
not
overly
turned
on
by
but
certainly
not
turned
off
by
either
this
one
was
pretty
good
it
would
be
a
really
good
easy
drinker
for
the
summer
but
i
feel
the
herbal
peppery
flavors
arent
my
favorites
i
would
rather
go
with
an
apa
to
session
pretty
good
for
the
style
though
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
fairly
aggressive
pour
yields
a
rather
limp
head
ivory
colored
reasonably
dense
but
about
an
inch
and
falling
quickly
to
a
thin
foam
the
beer
is
dark
golden
with
a
very
slight
haze
the
nose
shows
earth
green
herbs
and
mint
and
toasted
white
bread
that
shows
through
on
the
tongue
toowith
a
little
malt
sweetness
and
some
breadiness
leading
to
a
cleansing
dryness
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
is
a
nice
change
from
the
alcoholic
hop
teas
that
pass
for
ipas
these
days
i
wish
it
were
a
little
prettier
in
the
glass
but
ill
look
for
this
again
d
it
isnt
really
awful
it
just
isnt
very
good
the
hop
flavors
arent
very
pronounced
and
the
after
taste
is
unpleasant
i
am
sad
i
grabbed
a
six
pack
of
these
reviewed
on
02262011
023648
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
my
favorite
a
little
too
dry
and
bitter
to
my
liking
but
overall
a
respectable
beer
o
overall
its
an
ipa
an
above
average
ipa
eh
pretty
average
but
it
looks
nice
and
the
piney
flavor
isnt
overpowering
like
some
others
take
that
as
you
will
would
i
buy
it
again
subjectively
no
im
not
a
huge
ipa
guy
but
there
is
the
rare
ipa
that
i
do
like
and
i
try
to
rate
objectively
this
is
nothing
special
for
a
craft
ipa
decent
flavor
and
refreshing
but
does
not
stand
out
as
being
excellent
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
blank
best
by
date
this
pours
a
light
golden
color
maybe
yellow
with
a
decent
white
head
which
leaves
a
lacing
the
smell
is
of
toffee
and
malts
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
the
taste
is
okay
a
little
bitterness
with
some
sweet
malts
low
hop
profile
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
i
liked
many
other
lh
beers
more
but
this
does
not
hurt
the
name
had
this
beer
a
few
times
now
and
each
time
i
just
dont
care
for
it
the
look
of
the
beer
is
nice
the
color
is
a
nice
clear
copper
color
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
on
top
the
smell
isnt
really
that
pleasing
to
me
its
hoppy
but
it
kinda
smells
weird
to
me
the
taste
is
even
worse
i
dont
know
what
they
use
in
this
brew
but
i
really
dont
care
for
it
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
and
its
drinkable
for
sure
overall
if
the
taste
was
better
this
brew
would
be
awesome
but
im
just
not
sure
of
it
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
was
a
nice
yellow
golden
wheat
color
with
a
simple
1
finger
white
head
the
aroma
was
strong
of
citrus
not
much
more
to
it
the
taste
was
nice
and
fresh
but
not
overly
hoppy
which
i
like
there
was
nice
lemon
and
orange
flavors
along
with
a
faint
spruce
note
the
brew
was
a
little
high
in
carbonation
for
being
such
a
light
body
brew
this
was
average
for
the
style
overall
glad
i
revisited
this
with
a
fresher
example
this
is
a
pretty
decent
example
of
a
british
style
ipa
very
nice
give
it
a
go
this
is
a
smooth
well
balanced
drinkable
ipa
its
bitter
but
unoffensive
and
just
complex
enough
to
keep
you
interested
o
very
nice
this
is
an
extremely
wellbalanced
ipa
and
one
that
will
appeal
to
hopheads
and
or
advocates
alike
o
this
is
certainly
a
well
balanced
beer
hitting
heavy
with
the
biscuity
malts
to
balance
out
the
hops
or
maybe
its
the
other
way
around
either
way
this
brew
brings
a
lot
of
good
flavors
ooverall
this
is
decent
i
wouldnt
buy
this
to
just
enjoy
its
not
bad
just
doesnt
suit
my
taste
that
well
i
would
recommend
this
to
someone
who
maybe
wants
to
try
a
mild
ipa
or
a
lighter
ipa
but
not
as
a
beer
i
enjoy
overall
not
bad
but
also
not
impressive
i
believe
there
are
better
ipas
to
be
had
its
definitely
good
but
maybe
a
step
below
their
porters
stouts
and
the
good
juju
there
are
some
off
flavors
here
too
which
makes
me
think
this
may
not
be
the
freshest
sample
i
can
make
this
beer
work
but
there
are
so
many
better
english
style
ipas
out
there
ok
nothing
really
off
with
it
but
no
flavors
that
wow
me
pours
a
nice
honeygold
color
with
a
thick
head
head
retention
was
lacking
but
left
some
decent
lacing
down
the
sides
taste
was
very
hop
centered
but
well
balanced
with
the
malts
malt
taste
was
great
and
gave
hints
of
honey
and
caramel
flavors
the
more
that
i
drink
this
one
the
more
it
grows
on
me
i
like
the
overall
balance
of
this
brew
o
i
like
the
idea
of
a
more
balanced
ipa
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
probably
wouldnt
go
for
again
400
pound
monkey
english
india
pale
ale
was
a
slighty
above
average
the
taste
was
mellow
compared
to
what
you
expect
from
a
india
pale
ale
even
though
it
did
have
as
bitter
of
a
taste
the
finish
was
still
nice
overall
i
would
give
this
beer
a
b
grade
overall
i
am
not
very
familiar
with
english
ipas
though
i
have
read
they
are
supposed
to
be
more
watery
than
theamerican
version
but
this
isnt
watery
but
basically
lacking
any
hop
bitterness
or
body
that
i
expected
overall
drinkability
entirely
unimpressive
not
bad
just
too
one
dimensional
for
my
tastes
considering
im
rating
this
beer
by
style
this
fat
monkey
faces
significant
competition
and
unfortunately
ranks
a
bit
low
on
the
bell
curve
again
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
very
impressive
or
noteworthy
especially
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
oily
slick
with
very
light
carbonation
a
medium
body
and
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
this
could
be
a
session
beer
for
me
only
a
14
offwhite
head
which
faded
fast
slightly
hazed
raw
sienna
yellow
color
smells
mildly
of
hops
taste
is
medium
hoppy
with
a
little
citrus
look
although
this
is
a
decent
ipa
id
enjoy
anytime
and
not
overdone
i
really
dont
see
anything
deserving
the
400
pound
monkey
designation
about
it
cool
label
though
have
no
hesitation
serving
this
to
my
hoploving
friends
pours
a
clean
yellow
to
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
grassy
hos
and
a
gingerbread
malt
in
the
taste
gingerbread
like
malt
and
grassy
hops
a
small
hop
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
gingerbread
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
aftertaste
mellow
and
quite
english
but
nice
and
enjoyable
a
little
heavy
for
a
sessionable
ipa
but
still
a
good
effort
o
good
o
a
nice
daily
ale
d
a
solid
ipa
fruity
and
good
hop
profile
o
overall
a
very
tasty
ipa
i
liked
the
combination
and
balance
between
the
sweet
and
bitter
feels
in
the
palate
well
done
left
hand
o
im
definitely
not
impressed
with
this
beer
it
doesnt
really
have
much
to
offer
besides
an
entertaining
albeit
somewhat
gaudy
label
not
sure
if
this
is
old
or
a
bad
batch
but
it
definitely
was
not
good
for
me
overall
a
sessionable
brew
but
not
something
id
buy
again
i
thought
this
beer
would
be
better
than
this
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
a
very
long
time
everytime
i
saw
it
it
was
always
out
of
code
this
time
it
was
in
code
english
style
ipa
i
love
all
ipa
but
sometimes
the
over
hoped
american
ones
is
a
too
much
i
love
this
smell
and
color
of
this
beer
this
beer
like
most
ipa
has
no
head
or
some
this
is
nice
balance
beer
i
really
happy
i
have
try
this
beer
this
is
a
very
nice
session
beer
and
i
would
drink
this
doing
my
grilling
or
clean
try
it
cheers
the
first
ipa
of
the
night
expecting
hoppy
aroma
but
im
not
getting
any
not
a
good
sign
is
the
beer
old
skunked
ive
had
this
before
and
draft
and
i
dont
remember
it
being
so
lifeless
but
that
was
a
long
time
ago
from
the
bottle
it
fails
to
excite
the
taste
is
off
and
theres
an
awful
finish
sticky
unbalanced
harsh
the
bottles
the
last
of
a
six
pack
purchased
a
little
over
a
month
ago
which
could
mean
its
a
couple
months
old
at
this
point
depending
on
how
long
it
took
to
reach
the
shelves
but
im
told
the
first
five
tasted
the
same
a
disappointment
from
a
brewery
that
i
have
had
nothing
but
praise
for
o
more
fruits
than
anything
not
too
bad
of
a
brew
but
nothing
crazy
doesnt
taste
like
an
ipa
great
initial
taste
but
ends
musty
overall
a
decent
middle
of
the
road
ipa
however
i
think
its
not
balanced
well
enough
to
be
considered
an
english
ipa
and
not
hoppy
enough
to
be
an
american
one
im
still
looking
for
a
good
american
interpretation
of
jaipur
gotta
give
props
to
the
label
designers
though
its
a
really
cool
design
that
you
can
easily
get
lost
in
whether
or
not
youve
had
a
couple
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
even
if
it
wasnt
kicking
me
with
hops
and
new
flavors
every
few
seconds
tastes
a
little
sweet
upfront
with
a
middle
bitterness
kick
then
a
soapy
malty
texture
the
citrus
hops
is
there
with
a
slight
nutty
bready
malt
flavor
the
taste
is
different
based
as
an
english
ipa
style
i
feel
this
one
takes
on
some
notable
american
notes
a
welcome
change
from
traditional
us
ipas
it
sure
seems
to
cross
the
boundaries
between
the
english
american
ipa
styles
overall
pretty
nice
and
balanced
its
a
little
light
in
the
hops
a
nice
example
of
the
style
pretty
easy
to
drink
also
worth
a
drink
o
nice
beer
to
sip
on
and
would
try
it
again
for
the
serious
hoppy
ipa
taste
look
elsewhere
overall
a
well
balanced
ipa
that
was
not
overpowered
by
hops
and
was
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
good
brew
the
appearance
is
impressive
this
beer
sports
a
nice
fluffy
head
and
orangeamber
color
hopsherbal
in
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
about
right
not
too
intense
the
taste
is
perhaps
a
bit
too
herbal
for
my
blood
i
felt
as
though
i
were
drinking
carbonated
herbal
tea
at
points
which
is
not
necessarily
preferable
at
any
rate
it
is
still
pretty
decent
o
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
nothing
special
i
made
the
mistake
of
turning
down
my
refrigerator
a
bit
too
much
and
as
a
result
this
beer
was
near
frozen
when
i
opened
it
so
it
poured
with
no
head
at
all
although
it
appears
as
though
it
does
under
normal
circumstances
according
to
other
reviews
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
with
just
a
bit
of
orange
herbal
resinous
hop
nose
with
a
bit
of
estery
fruit
as
well
the
hops
are
up
front
and
persist
throughout
but
are
in
pretty
good
balance
with
the
malt
which
makes
sense
since
they
are
going
for
a
more
english
style
this
is
not
your
typical
west
coast
style
ipa
which
is
a
nice
change
not
to
say
i
dont
love
west
coast
ipas
i
do
another
solid
offering
from
a
pretty
underrated
brewery
overall
the
beer
presents
a
surprising
flavor
profile
and
is
worth
a
try
not
bad
but
i
would
not
have
again
overall
an
ok
ipa
im
slightly
disappointed
after
having
their
milk
stout
note
im
not
used
to
drinking
many
english
ipas
so
compared
to
an
american
it
is
very
different
gold
colored
brew
just
the
slightest
of
haze
small
white
head
doesnt
last
long
but
still
laces
up
the
joint
caramel
malt
scent
with
a
fair
amount
of
diacetyl
followed
by
some
bitter
hops
caramel
malt
front
biscuity
some
butteryness
but
not
much
floral
and
bitter
hops
and
some
spiciness
from
the
alcohol
medium
bodied
pretty
sharp
on
the
tongue
its
definitely
an
american
take
on
an
eipa
and
i
think
they
put
together
a
good
one
o
a
very
refreshing
english
ipa
although
theres
not
as
much
hop
or
malt
flavor
as
an
american
ipa
the
abv
is
comparable
a
nice
balanced
beer
o
lightish
bodied
but
packs
a
big
punch
on
the
flavor
as
advertised
not
the
same
old
o
these
english
india
pale
ales
pair
well
with
spicy
food
good
beer
m
a
bit
thin
and
under
carbonated
for
my
taste
overall
this
isnt
that
bad
its
certainly
got
a
solid
hop
presence
but
not
a
distinct
character
i
still
say
its
alright
d
not
bad
but
it
is
strongly
overshadowed
by
my
recent
tasting
of
samuel
smiths
not
a
bad
take
on
the
english
india
though
and
maybe
ill
revisit
sometime
clear
gold
with
a
short
white
cap
lots
of
fine
bubbles
clung
to
the
glass
decent
head
retention
the
aroma
was
floral
a
bit
citrusy
and
grassy
toasted
malts
and
honey
moderate
bitterness
with
a
citrus

toasty
and
bready

grassy
hops
lingering
bitterness
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
medium
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
slight
resin
texture
overall
i
enjoyed
it
this
could
make
for
an
awesome
session
beer
just
needs
to
drop
a
percent
or
two
the
website
does
not
give
the
ibus
i
would
put
them
somewhere
in
the
mid
60s
the
website
also
lists
wheat
on
the
grain
bill
brilliant
why
didnt
i
think
of
that
d
acquired
in
a
2
for
2
trade
with
a
friend
not
fantastic
but
a
good
effort
from
left
hand
recommend
trying
but
not
seeking
out
poured
this
english
ipa
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
nice
pale
amber
color
very
good
clarity
this
ipa
produced
a
nice
white
head
and
very
good
head
retention
the
aroma
was
a
nice
hoppy
herbal
and
pepper
mix
there
was
some
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
very
malty
bread
like
base
that
is
full
of
fresh
hop
bitterness
this
ipa
is
a
very
good
classic
rep
of
the
style
this
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
has
a
dry
finish
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
i
hated
it
no
fear
left
hand
did
a
solid
enough
job
on
the
milk
stout
to
have
me
coming
back
to
them
just
not
for
the
monkey
real
good
beer
overall
no
flash
or
wows
just
a
solid
enjoyable
brew
could
be
a
good
icebreaker
for
a
noncrafter
i
found
this
beer
somewhat
unremarkable
when
i
tried
it
from
a
bottle
later
i
visited
the
left
hand
taproom
in
longmont
co
and
found
the
cask
version
on
tap
wow
what
a
difference
it
had
acquired
a
delightfully
silky
mouthfeel
and
a
soft
head
at
6
7
and
a
fourtyfive
minute
drive
home
i
had
to
drink
far
less
than
i
would
have
liked
d
a
solid
english
ipa
overall
is
a
good
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
for
sure
o
well
made
ipa
but
requires
more
hops
in
my
opinion
d
not
a
bad
brew
could
definitely
be
a
session
beer
transparent
golden
in
body
topped
by
white
bubbly
head
smells
of
some
lightly
toasted
malts
corn
sugar
and
sour
grain
lemon
citrus
rind
grass
bitter
and
dry
finishes
sour
grain
light
in
body
with
high
carbonation
a
bit
offensive
and
unsatisfying
in
all
aspects
o
fairly
good
overall
nothing
special
needs
more
hops
o
looked
good
and
initially
smelled
good
and
even
the
upfront
flavor
was
good
the
finish
just
threw
it
all
off
o
this
is
a
strange
version
of
an
english
ipa
its
hard
to
pin
down
its
not
a
horrible
beer
but
neither
is
it
a
brilliant
one
overall
a
decent
ipa
with
good
hops
flavors
and
bitterness
i
like
the
abv
for
sessions
and
this
tastes
really
refreshing
ice
cold
i
would
definitely
have
one
again
and
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
sometime
overall
its
a
good
beer
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
ill
be
seeing
it
again
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
light
amber
color
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
dissipates
somewhat
slowly
and
leaves
a
thin
cap
that
lingers
throughout
it
also
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
it
smells
largely
of
hops
floral
and
herbal
but
some
bready
sweetness
there
as
well
tastes
nice
more
malt
than
i
would
have
expected
but
still
very
much
on
the
hoppy
side
the
malty
caramel
flavor
gives
over
quickly
to
the
floral
hops
and
finishes
semidry
with
a
nice
lingering
bitterness
it
feels
good
on
the
tongue
on
the
thin
side
of
mediumbodied
overall
this
one
is
a
really
nice
beer
very
drinkable
well
done
left
hand
there
was
a
nice
floral
hoppiness
somewhat
muted
hints
of
orange
and
lemongrass
with
a
touch
of
pine
decent
malt
base
was
apparent
as
the
aroma
of
bread
came
through
nicely
the
flavor
followed
much
of
the
same
owing
that
nice
light
floral
hoppiness
but
never
having
enough
of
it
to
really
push
it
all
the
way
forward
nice
little
bite
of
bitter
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
a
slightly
fruit
finish
with
apples
coming
through
very
clearly
especially
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
maybe
a
touch
watery
but
had
more
then
decent
carbonation
a
bit
of
a
slickness
to
it
as
well
superbly
session
able
though
as
this
was
a
very
easy
drinker
and
i
could
have
thrown
this
one
down
all
night
long
to
be
honest
overall
you
had
better
go
to
your
local
craft
beer
store
or
pub
and
snag
this
up
before
i
do
if
they
dont
have
it
perform
unmentionable
favors
for
your
local
beer
store
guy
in
order
to
get
some
not
sure
whats
so
particularly
english
about
this
one
other
than
the
use
of
the
boadicea
hops
which
are
relatively
unknown
other
than
they
are
named
for
a
celticengland
warrior
queen
similar
to
czech
saaz
in
profile
from
what
i
can
discern
anywho
rockin
brew
yall
a
not
so
nice
earthy
taste
generally
i
like
earth
tones
so
not
sure
why
not
this
time
it
was
a
bit
medally
as
well
so
perhaps
that
was
my
problem
with
it
cool
label
though
sorry
but
this
one
is
a
complete
miss
for
me
this
is
the
3rd
one
ive
had
out
of
the
6er
and
ive
felt
the
same
about
each
one
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
tame
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
biscuit
malts
along
with
a
noble
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
an
easy
drinking
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
with
a
moderate
hop
bitterness
and
a
nice
biscuit
malt
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
beer
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
it
does
justice
to
the
style
as
i
mentioned
the
hops
are
a
little
unusual
though
they
seem
like
the
appropriate
regional
hops
they
just
dont
normally
appear
in
this
style
so
i
dont
think
that
it
is
the
spawn
of
a
clonebrew
at
least
not
one
i
am
familiar
with
either
way
i
have
a
6pack
of
this
beer
and
i
will
gladly
drink
it
though
i
will
spread
these
out
as
i
doubt
that
i
can
do
more
than
a
couple
in
one
sitting
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
blend
nicely
but
there
could
be
a
bit
more
of
them
i
like
the
bit
of
fruit
flavor
and
the
bready
malts
though
ill
drink
another
one
and
try
to
taste
and
smell
harder
but
im
guessing
there
will
be
4
of
these
left
for
my
nephews
when
they
come
to
visit
this
summer
indiscriminately
drinking
any
and
all
beer
in
the
fridge
overall
i
am
not
that
fond
of
this
one
a
very
nice
english
style
ipa
laid
back
and
mellow
but
full
of
flavor
nonetheless
makes
a
pleasant
change
from
the
american
style
ipas
ive
been
drinking
wont
convert
me
however
definitely
recomended
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
brighter
crystal
clear
tangold
coloring
with
a
foamy
light
bubbled
white
head
that
starts
at
a
healthy
2
inches
and
eventually
settles
into
a
film
aromas
of
light
hoppiness
combined
with
a
sweet
caramel
and
citrustangerine
character
that
is
intriguing
bitter
and
peppery
hop
forward
flavor
with
the
citrus
providing
a
decent
backseat
balance
good
lacing
on
the
glass
the
beer
has
a
slick
almost
oily
feel
in
mouth
peppered
hop
aftertaste
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
very
true
to
the
style
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
than
this
tasty
brew
o
i
thought
this
was
above
average
fairly
drinkable
and
abv
not
noticeable
at
least
after
one
o
im
going
to
reserve
my
judgment
for
another
day
on
this
one
it
was
good
enough
to
keep
me
interested
but
not
to
the
point
that
ill
run
right
out
to
fill
the
growler
again
maybe
next
time
ill
try
to
find
it
in
a
bottle
and
see
if
that
makes
a
difference
o
a
nicely
balanced
fruity
juicy
beer
fine
session
beer
400
pound
monkey
is
another
solid
ipa
in
a
long
lineup
of
solid
american
ipas
while
there
may
not
be
much
to
distinguish
it
from
the
pack
there
is
every
reason
in
the
world
to
buy
it
again
unrestrained
hoppiness
balancing
maltiness
solid
flavor
gratifying
and
refreshing
drinkability
in
fact
the
only
problem
with
it
is
that
after
one
you
want
at
least
two
more
overall
it
seems
like
the
bottled
version
is
wimpy
compared
to
the
tap
but
without
a
bar
in
the
state
to
serve
it
my
taste
buds
will
not
soon
be
satisfied
poured
a
hazy
golden
amber
color
with
a
good
amount
of
white
head
on
it
smell
was
very
good
nice
hops
some
bready
and
floral
notes
as
well
taste
was
great
solid
bitter
hop
flavor
throughout
with
some
bready
malt
coming
through
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
this
beer
went
down
nice
and
smooth
would
definitely
go
for
it
again
sometime
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
left
hand
really
does
know
what
theyre
doing
in
the
brews
that
they
make
try
this
one
if
you
have
the
chance
overall
i
like
this
beer
i
would
drink
it
as
much
as
i
would
any
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
its
a
little
different
because
it
seems
a
bit
lighter
than
other
ipas
i
suggest
you
go
buy
this
and
see
for
yourself
this
beer
is
flavorful
somewhat
light
not
watered
down
but
it
still
grabs
your
taste
buds
and
squeezes
them
till
you
beg
for
more
overall
this
ones
a
winner
ill
definitely
buy
this
again
all
over
the
map
with
this
one
takes
a
better
palate
than
mine
to
sense
the
subtle
nature
of
of
this
brew
i
felt
the
taste
was
a
bit
airy
at
times
with
hop
bitterness
running
the
show
tastes
a
bit
different
than
it
smells
not
bad
but
minor
league
as
far
as
ipas
go
pours
a
slightly
hazy
offgolden
color
with
medium
sized
head
mixed
citrus
and
cakebread
on
the
nose
some
of
that
cakebread
quality
is
present
on
the
palate
too
with
a
nicely
balanced
bitterness
a
mineral
component
is
there
too
easy
drinking
and
a
refreshing
change
from
so
many
american
ipa
d
despite
its
flaws
it
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
while
this
isnt
a
session
beer
i
could
have
easily
had
a
few
in
a
sitting
since
it
wasnt
that
strong
and
didnt
leave
me
puckering
up
after
each
sip
having
the
bottling
date
legible
in
english
on
the
side
was
also
good
even
though
this
was
a
bit
older
than
i
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
pleasant
surprises
are
one
of
the
aspects
of
trying
new
beers
that
i
love
and
this
certainly
fell
under
that
category
im
surprised
this
isnt
rated
higher
on
here

not

as
i
expected
not
a
big

one
was
enough
for
me
o
never
again
one
of
the
worst
beer
tasting
experiences
ever
its
dinner
time
for
the
kids
and
we
have
been
all
over
the
bourbonais
and
chicago
area
this
morning
and
afternoon
my
daughter
placed
10th
over
all
at
her
state
gymnastics
meet
for
her
age
group
sweet
buddy
brought
this
beer
over
and
decided
to
try
it
tonight
wish
i
didnt
i
really
dont
think
i
like
this
beer
its
a
cloudy
golden
thin
white
head
and
decent
lacing
not
much
smell
and
the
taste
is
all
english
style
but
it
is
not
as
good
as
bass
anyway
good
luck
if
you
try
this
one
its
not
for
me
besides
its
strange
and
off
flavors
from
dead
yeast
this
one
is
pretty
much
normal
overall
this
sure
aint
no
english
ipa
and
i
sure
do
love
those
english
pale
ales
this
is
its
blondie
sexy
fullbodied
fullflavored
floozy
american
hoppier
version
that
unabashedly
flaunts
fullfrontal
strong
alcohol
with
your
overwhelmed
tastebuds
had
me
at
first
sip
i
sure
aint
no
hophead
but
i
sure
so
recognize
a
very
very
good
beer
i
wuz
taken
with
this
one
very
recommended
personal
critique
i
bought
and
opened
the
beer
without
any
preconceptions
and
was
throughly
disappointed
i
came
to
ba
expecting
it
to
get
a
slamming
but
it
seems
other
people
like
it
i
love
ipas
but
id
rather
be
drinking
a
pbr
or
high
life
than
this
maybe
i
got
a
shitty
bottle
even
though
its
a
one
and
a
quarter
month
old
and
i
got
it
refrigerated
from
a
specialty
beer
store
im
just
happy
i
sipgag
was
able
to
distract
myself
with
this
review
while
drinking
the
beer
easy
drinking
this
is
the
third
decent
beer
ive
had
from
the
left
hand
missed
12
pack
a
good
12
pack
to
pick
up
if
youre
having
people
over
for
a
casual
evening
of
games
and
brews
and
want
something
that
will
taste
good
but
not
overtax
the
pallates
of
your
guests
drinkability
theres
an
interesting
yeasty
fruitiness
to
it
and
as
an
english
style
ipa
it
can
get
away
with
less
hops
in
the
nose
and
flavor
but
it
somehow
seems
off
i
suspect
its
fermented
a
bit
high
in
temperature
this
pours
hazy
light
orange
with
1
12
fingers
of
foamy
head
and
some
lacing
the
nose
is
light
hops
with
a
stronger
sweet
malty
smell
to
follow
the
taste
is
very
bitter
with
a
hint
of
honey
up
front
this
reminds
me
of
an
english
bitter
400
pound
monkey
is
tasty
but
pretty
bitter
i
would
like
a
little
more
malt
balance
the
body
is
medium
but
overall
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
good
beer
for
a
change
i
usually
like
american
ipa
this
is
similar
to
goose
island
honkers
ale
only
more
bold
the
box
says
earth
and
herbal
i
would
agree
with
that
maybe
aged
wet
hops
very
earthy
poured
from
a
bottle
thin
head
dissolves
quickly
orangeyellow
colored
beer
smells
of
fruity
hops
orange
citrus
smell
predominates
taste
is
also
orange
flavored
hops
a
very
mild
bitter
hop
kick
but
nothing
like
a
hoppy
ipa
or
czech
pilsner
mouthfeel
is
average
average
carbonation
and
density
and
smoothness
drinkability
is
ok
about
average
im
not
craving
another
but
i
wouldnt
pass
on
having
it
again
d
can
drink
a
lot
of
it
but
does
not
look
to
forward
to
next
sip
could
use
more
carbonation
to
get
the
flavors
to
pop
a
bit
more
lighter
bodied
almost
watery
sessionable
feeling
but
abv
kind
of
prevents
that
all
right
for
the
english
style
clear
in
glass
good
head
carbonation
correct
nice
flavors
and
mouth
feel
not
as
hoppy
as
i
would
expect
definitely
different
than
your
typical
american
ipa
quite
good
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
notes
this
is
a
mediumbodied
fullflavored
example
of
what
americans
can
do
with
a
british
style
the
creamy
mouthfeel
screams
english
the
hop
character
brings
out
the
us
side
a
solid
brew
and
may
be
one
of
my
new
favorite
offerings
from
left
hand
even
at
its
strength
is
a
session
brew
by
all
means
overall
not
a
bad
ipa
but
not
a
favorite
of
mine
despite
being
mild
for
the
type
its
still
bitter
and
that
abv
is
pretty
manly
one
of
these
is
plenty
it
has
a
lighter
body
that
leaves
the
mouth
finely
coated
and
the
drinkability
is
also
very
good
a
nice
brew
from
left
hand
a
unique
ipa
thats
definitely
sixerworthy
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
and
drinkable
this
beer
definitely
has
the
abv
of
an
ipa
making
it
less
sessionable
no
matter
how
much
the
flavor
wants
it
to
be
being
a
bit
toned
down
this
beer
would
be
a
nice
choice
for
someone
wanting
to
try
an
ipa
but
not
wanting
something
too
wild
as
to
ruin
their
experience
great
beer
left
hand
brewing
co
d
really
really
good
from
random
notes

lots
of
floral
and
herbal

with
a

appearance
sparkling
gold
with
a
thick
white

sweetness

with
a

a
light
sourness
not
unpleasant
and
quite
drinkable
palate
lightmedium
body
slick
texture
lively
carbonation
and
a
long
finish
overall
left
hand
clearly
doesnt
go
for
the
the
hoppier
the
better
ipa
route
which
makes
this
beer
stand
out
the
hops
are
there
and
quite
flavorful
but
not
so
overpowering
that
the
drinker
is
forced
to
pucker
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
an
interesting
take
on
an
ipa
the
pour
is
a
pale
orange
color
in
a
pint
glass
creating
a
thin
white
head
smells
of
citrus
yeast
and
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
the
taste
has
some
nice
hops
with
bitter
fruits
the
hops
arent
overpowering
at
all
a
very
easy
drinking
ipa
with
a
bitter
finish
i
could
easily
drink
more
than
one
of
these
pours
a
dark
straw
color
wit
a
bronze
tint
to
it
with
a
white
head
head
is
average
sized
foamy
and
leaves
some
decent
lacing
taste
is
well
balanced
a
subtle
herbal
hops
with
some
tea
leaf
flavors
and
a
grainy
backbone
lighter
bodied
and
clean
on
the
palate
not
my
kind
of
ipa
but
definitely
a
nice
change
of
pace
very
easy
to
enjoy
a
few
of
these
md
clean
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
the
aftertaste
leaves
me
wanting
more
with
the
semidry
finish
one
of
the
more
drinkable
ipas
ive
had
in
a
while
12oz
bottle
pours
a
hazy
yellowish
orange
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipates
quickly
minimal
lacing
aromas
of
citrus
hops
yeast
and
orange
peel
taste
has
a
nice
hop
bite
to
it
upfront
citrusy
and
bitter
with
some
breadiness
to
it
interesting
beer
its
a
different
kind
of
english
ipa
and
im
digging
it
worth
having
again
md
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
washes
down
quickly
it
isnt
as
drinkable
as
some
of
the
other
eipas
ive
had
but
is
overall
really
nice
not
my
favorite
ipa
but
definitely
good
none
the
less
a
straightup
nostringsattached
fullon
modern
english
ipa
we
dig
it
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
to
be
considered
sessionable
perhaps
but
it
wants
to
be
left
hand
continues
to
disappoint
overall
this
is
a
good
sessionable
drinker
there
are
much
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
but
its
worth
a
try
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
however
d
an
english
ipa
that
ventures
away
from
its
roots
toward
the
realm
of
its
american
cousin
thats
one
big
sixarmed
monkey
it
pours
a
hazy
gold
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
sweet
caramel
light
grapefruit
and
honeydew
the
taste
holds
notes
of
grapefruit
light
caramel
and
a
lightish
pine
near
the
finish
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
dryish
finish
overall
a
very
nice
eipa
but
not
necessarily
something
i
would
actively
seek
out
again
cheers
drinkability
you
wouldnt
know
this
one
is
nearly
7
except
for
a
whiff
of
booziness
in
the
nose
very
easy
drinking
and
balanced
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
and
not
know
what
hit
me
drinkability
is
good
kind
of
an
odd
beer
but
i
like
the
uniqueness
of
this
one
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
unbalanced
to
be
sessionable
but
the
malt
yeast
and
water
characteristics
are
spot
on
for
what
i
might
look
for
in
an
english
pale
ale
id
rather
have
less
hops
not
inclined
to
buy
it
again
but
its
a
quality
brew
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
very
large
very
tight
white
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
aroma
is
not
particularly
pungent
and
certainly
less
so
than
is
expected
out
of
most
ipas
there
is
some
caramel
biscuit
toned
malts
are
in
there
some
mango
some
odd
stinkiness
and
some
nice
floral
notes
this
one
is
pretty
damned
bitter
which
is
a
good
thing
but
there
isnt
a
lot
of
flavor
backing
up
that
bitterness
there
is
some
resiny
and
fruity
hop
character
but
really
you
kind
of
have
to
strain
for
it
the
malt
is
one
of
the
most
defined
things
in
the
aroma
i
generally
like
my
ipas
on
the
bitter
and
dry
side
with
very
little
malt
character
there
is
little
doubt
that
these
descriptors
fit
the
bill
with
this
one
but
im
dying
for
a
little
bit
more
hop
character
beyond
bitterness
its
got
the
grapefruit
without
the
fruity
character
with
minor
tweaking
i
think
this
might
be
wonderful
this
is
of
course
wishful
thinking
drink
its
an
okay
rep
of
the
style
i
think
needs
a
bit
of
work
1400th
review
12
ounce
bottle
overall
a
very
good
depiction
of
the
style
but
nonetheless
slightly
cloying
with
respect
to
taste
and
mouthfeel
oily
with
a
bitter
alcohol
afterbite
piney
hops
predominate
the
palate
with
a
thick
and
viscous
mouthfeel
average
drinkability
at
best
did
not
flow
as
smoothly
but
an
accurate
representation
of
the
genre
good
stuff
but
ive
had
better
from
left
hand
pours
an
ultra
clear
light
goldenyellow
fine
and
large
carb
bubbles
a
white
head
patches
to
the
glass
a
nice
clean
beer
to
look
at
smell
borders
on
some
adjuncts
but
i
get
a
nice
mild
evergreen
hops
note
some
spice
and
a
bit
of
biscuit
tastes
just
the
same
except
the
dry
hopping
makes
it
a
bit
more
pronounced
the
abv
is
right
for
this
one
definitely
finishes
bitter
but
not
painfully
so
maybe
could
use
an
upkick
in
the
malt
department
but
its
still
an
easy
drinker
and
a
nice
ipa
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
and
probably
underrated
because
of
its
english
classification
d
a
well
crafted
brew
id
drink
another
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
an
almost
nonexistant
head
smell
is
of
candied
fruits
and
a
touch
of
caramel
taste
is
a
burst
of
watermellon
up
front
followed
by
a
toffee
and
bread
crust
middle
and
a
flowery
spicy
hop
finish
resinous
hops
cling
to
your
toungue
relentlessly
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
rich
nice
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
with
the
higher
alcohol
levels
and
the
toungue
clinging
hops
its
good
for
about
one
per
drinking
session
other
than
those
two
negatives
its
very
good
very
drinkable
this
goes
down
way
fast
would
be
a
great
summer
ipa
maybe
a
bit
too
carbonated
for
my
liking
nonetheless
drinks
incredibly
well
for
7
this
is
your
typical
ipa
it
has
a
great
taste
strong
hoppy
presence
a
great
label
which
is
what
prompted
me
to
buy
it
and
overall
a
very
good
beer
this
is
my
first
brew
from
left
hand
and
it
will
probably
not
be
my
last
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
well
carbonated
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
will
make
you
burp
but
force
it
through
your
nose
and
its
sweet
grapefruit
really
quite
pleasing
despite
what
you
might
think
at
first
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
nice
in
the
palate
the
moderately
sweet
and
moderately
bitter
easy
drinking
and
mild
flavors
im
not
a
huge
eipa
fan
this
one
isnt
too
malty
i
put
it
down
quickly
id
have
it
again
not
as
heavy
as
some
ive
had
pours
a
moderate
copper
color
with
a
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
brings
some
light
bready
notes
as
well
as
some
floral
earthy
and
light
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
mildly
hoppy
with
a
light
caramel
background
feel
is
a
bit
bitter
with
a
nice
body
not
the
best
of
the
style
that
ive
had
but
pretty
good
d
mellow
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
something
hoppy
this
might
be
too
mellow
for
you
very
easy
to
drink
d
as
i
said
before
this
was
not
as
hoppy
as
i
prefer
my
ipas
but
it
was
quite
drinkable
maybe
it
would
have
been
better
in
a
bottle
as
i
have
noticed
some
aggressively
hoppy
bottled
beers
are
less
hop
forward
on
tap
like
snpa
again
drink
this
one
in
the
middle
of
summer
all
summer
long
and
enjoy
a
very
palatable
beer
for
beginners
in
the
ipa
world
as
well
not
a
must
drink
for
hopheads
but
definitely
a
solid
selection
if
faced
with
meager
selection
enjoyed
at
the
grill
next
door
in
haverhill
ma
this
brew
shows
a
straw
amber
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
and
good
lacing
i
find
the
aroma
to
be
a
very
vague
maybe
a
slightly
wheatgrass
deal
pretty
disappointing
for
an
introduction
it
proves
to
be
a
mediumlight
bodied
beer
and
the
mouth
feel
follows
suit
smooth
with
a
little
tingle
the
flavor
features
a
pretty
unattractive
leafy
bite
and
yes
i
get
the
vegetable
thing
like
everyone
else
seems
to
be
an
appropriate
analogy
though
thankfully
a
tolerably
mild
presence
i
find
this
to
be
a
pretty
mediocre
ale
at
best
its
drinkable
enough
if
youre
okay
with
the
somewhat
odd
flavor
worth
a
try
if
you
like
things
that
are
a
bit
unusual
and
its
a
quality
brew
if
the
taste
finds
favor
with
you
d
good
british
style
ipa
with
a
heavier
then
normal
malt
profile
a
mild
hit
of
hops
and
a
sustained
med
bitterness
i
got
the
troops
version
of
the
original
english
ipa
style
heavy
on
the
watered
down
good
for
style
and
goes
down
easily
balance
is
solid
this
is
a
nobrainer
for
me
personally
i
love
hops
and
this
left
me
a
bit
surprised
only
based
on
the
name
not
quite
as
heavyhanded
as
i
expected
but
oh
well
no
biggie
because
this
is
a
highly
sessionable
and
would
therefore
be
a
big
hit
at
gatherings
worthy
of
a
case
d
reasonably
drinkable
with
a
strong
citrus
hop
character
the
grapefruit
bitterness
is
quite
strong
and
is
barely
balanced
by
the
sweet
malt
towards
the
finish
the
malt
intensifies
with
more
toasted
character
and
toffee
not
bad
but
this
really
isnt
dry
enough
for
the
style
and
while
english
hops
are
great
in
bitters
i
prefer
american

if
i
werent
expecting
this
to
be

ipa
id
be
happy
drinking
a
few
but
overall
just
a
let
down
definitely
a
different
style
than
the

ipa
just
as
bitter
in

without
the

blast

wouldnt

again
anyone
want
some
i
have

left
nothing
really
special
about
this
ipa
its
just
very
dull
my
excitement
which
was
more
like
cautious
optimism
that
another
ipa
is
now
available
to
iowans
was
shortlived
400
pound

isnt
bad
beer
but
bitterness
isnt
enough
to
bring
this
hophead
back
for
another
visit
to
the
monkey
house

reference
i
think
this
is
delicious
a
definite
thirst
quencher
and
great
for
a

event
in
the
sunshine
i
also
think
400
pound
monkey
achieves
its
goal
of
simulating
an
englishstyle
ipa
i
could
definitely
tasteplace
this
in
any
of
the
many
pubs
i
crawled
inout
of
throughout
london
this

order
another
and
buy
six
balanced
enough
to
be
a
session
beer
hooray
a
touch
restrained
in
the
hop
department
but
the
amount
of
hops
matches
the
light
malt
and
body
that
this
beer
has
quite
well
more
hops
would
likely
overwhelm
the
balance
that
this
beer
has
this
is
definitely
an
enjoyable
and
definitely
hides
its
alcohol
pretty
well
not
my
preferred
type
of
ipa
at
all
but
the
balanced
hop
character
that
this
beer
achieves
has
me
really
enjoying
it
i
do
not
think
i
have
had
a
bad
beer
from
left
hand
brewery
maybe
because
i
am
lefthanded
it
is
subliminal
pours
a
nice
burnt
orange
color
with
a
gentle
white
head
smell
of
grainy
malts
and
a
mild
sauvignon
blanc
like
grassiness
taste
was
divine
the
hops
held
their
own
but
did
not
overpower
with
off
putting
oilyness
it
was
more
of
a
fine
biscuity
quality
with
a
hushed
sweetness
of
the
background
malts
i
just
love
this
brew
not
the
typical
hop
slam
most
ipas
delivery
which
coat
the
tonuge
in
harsh
bitterness
cheers
as
i
have
read
through
the
reviews
of
this
brew
i
have
to
agree
with
many
of
them
in
the
sense
that
this
brew
is
a
great
english
ipa
but
it
borrows
enough
of
the
characteristics
of
the
american
ipas
to
help
make
it
a
bit
more
drinkable
d
meh
this
is
a
pretty
forgettable
ipa
probably
wont
seek
this
one
out
again
glad
i
didnt
get

ipa
6

drinks
like
a
session
beer
though
overall
this
was
closer
to
an
english
ipa
than
i
remember
the
last
time
i
had
this
beer
although
neither
time
have
i
been
blown
away
still
a
solid
beer
that
i
think
benefits
from
the
cask
treatment
and
is
worth
a
shot
400
pound
monkey
was
a
hazy
golden
amber
color
it
had
a
short
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
a
good
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
english
hops
the
taste
was
hop
dominant
with
a
nice
bitterness
and
dry
finish
it
was
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
this
was
a
good
beer
and
worth
a
try
notes
not
a
bad
ipa
but
it
didnt
really
strike
me
as
great
i
wish
some
more
of
the
biscuit
malt
would
have
come
out
decent
english
ipa
thats
worth
a
try
thin
offwhite
head
on
a
slightly
hazy
amber
body
hop
flavors
are
a
little
faded
smooth
and
malty
with
good
bitterness
definitely
some
cooked
vegetable
qualities
which
are
strongest
and
most
offputting
in
the
aroma
the
cooked
vegetable
aspect
is
getting
stronger
as
the
beer
gets
warmer
i
just
had
this
at
a
left
hand
event
on
campus
university
of
cincinnati
in
a
flight
with
sawtooth
oktoberfest
twin
peaks
milk
stout
and
whatever
the
name
of
the
double
sawtooth
is
this
may
have
been
my
least
favorite
which
is
tough
for
me
with
my
love
for
hops
but
i
was
just
continuously
overwhelmed
by
the
sense
of
broccoli
i
got
it
in
the
nose
and
it
dominated
the
taste
its
a
decent
looking
beer
that
feels
good
and
goes
down
easy
but
being
unable
to
escape
the
smell
and
taste
of
broccoli
i
really
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
too
much
there
it
goes
beautiful
recovery
monkey
edgy
bitterness
in
the
english
vein
with
a
lasting
satisfying
oily
bitterness
none
of
the
pine
or
citrus
of
its
juiced
up
american
cousins
just
dry
herbal
alchohol
tinged
tastiness
a
bit
more
powerful
than
the
native
versions
of
the
style
but
after
a
decade
sampling
its
muscular
yank
relatives
i
have
to
say
i
prefer
this
approach
to
the
eipa
too
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
luxuriant
i
really
like
this
beer
even
for
the
dedicated
hopsaholic
it
is
nice
every
once
in
a
while
to
get
back
to
the
ipa
roots
and
sample
the
style
that
started
it
all
left
hand
takes
this
beer
straight
down
the
middle
with
a
quite
authentic
character
nice
substantial
malt
with
firm
but
not
overdone
hopping
the
abv
is
a
bit
higher
than
one
would
expect
from
the
flavor
overall
nicely
done
very
drinkable
but
could
use
some
work
d
moderate
drinkability
tasty
enough
but
not
particularly
memorable
creamy
feel
mild
hop
bitterness
earthy
and
floral
character
again
somewhat
buttery
not
sure
if
thats
really
a
hinderance
or
not
seems
to
fade
behind
a
dominant
floral
hop
flavor
and
biscuity
malt
a
little
fruitiness
would
be
a
good
compliment
here
but
there
is
none
earthy
aspirin
briefly
in
the
aftertaste
with
more
perfumy
florals
and
mild
bitterness
overall
its
good
for
what
it
is
but
not
one
id
seek
out
if
you
like
a
different
flavored
ipa
occasionally
this
is
a
nice
english
ipa
to
try
fairly
onedimensional
it
still
an
easy
drinking
interesting
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
hoppy
brew
you
wont
find
it
here
but
if
you
want
a
different
drinking
experience
from
all
the
american
ipas
by
all
means
give
it
a
try
likely
the
most
delicious
and
most
drinkable
of
left
hands
hoppy
beers
they
have
the
tendency
to
go
the
english
route
on
many
of
these
and
this
variety
borrows
just
enough
american
ipa
attributes
to
increase
the
drinkability
without
sacrificing
the
english
ipa
soul
i
like
this
brew
most
of
the
english
ipas
that
i
getat
least
three
from
arcadia
have
been
to
me
lacking
in
hop
flavor
when
i
see
ipa
i
dont
think
pale
are
there
any
bright
hops
in
this
one
r
is
it
all
noble
or
european
subtlelike
hops
american
or
imported
i
like
how
this
one
is
lighter
in
body
and
texture
closer
to
the
lagunitas
ipa
low
alcohol
makes
it
a
good
sessioner
very
complex
and
refreshing
a
lot
of
bitterness
on
the
flavor
with
a
burnt
biscuit
dark
earthy
malt
presence
hop
flavor
is
herbal
but
is
not
nearly
as
forward
as
many
american
style
ipas
has
a
caramel
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
hoppy
bitterness
and
provides
plenty
of
flavor
medium
bodied
and
has
ample
carbonation
a
pretty
interesting
take
on
the
british
ipa
style
quite
a
bit
going
on
here
tasty
but
all
the
flavors
dont
quite
come
together
perfectly
for
me
final
thoughts
all
in
all

beyond

it

one
i
would
recommend
trying
4

this
is
enjoyable
and
a

not

authentic

ale
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
so
i
appreciate
the
similarities
as
well
as
the
differences
glad
to
see
breweries
continue
to
push
the
envelope
of
their
portfolios
had
this
straight
from
the
bottle
the
other
night
just
really
starting
to
get
into
the
pale
alesthis
one
seems
sort
of
run
of
the
mill
slight
carbonation
and
citrus
taste
with
a
bitter
finish
that
seemed
to
make
me
forget
the
initial
flavour
goes
down
smooth
enough
and
seems
to
have
improved
taste
when
it
warms
to
about
65
degrees
probably
worth
a
second
shot
d
a
very
modest
and
drinkable
monkey
indeed
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
an
emglish
ipa
to
me
this
is
aipa
all
the
way
taste
wise
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
too
pronounced
compared
to
others
in
the
style
d
moderate
to
high
considering
the
style
and
alcohol
content
d
overall
i
enjoyed
this
offering
from
left
hand
and
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
it
is
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
a
solid
brew
that
is
worth
a
try
pours
a
light
gold
body
with
good
head
that
left
little
lace
and
has
a
funky
sour
citrus
hop
aroma
to
it
w
mild
bready
like
malts
smooth
and
light
to
medium
body
with
a
bitter
hopcitric
hop
taste
that
is
subdued
and
balanced
w
a
minor
caramel
and
bread
malt
base
the
flavors
are
balanced
and
subdued
so
nothing
really
pokes
out
but
is
very
easy
to
drink
beer
and
the
abv
for
such
a
pounder
really
surprises
me
def
worth
at
least
one
try
d
was
recommended
by
a
coworker
and
now
i
owe
him
one
english
ipas
tend
to
be
my
fave
and
this
one
certainly
doesnt
disappoint
a
nice
easy
drinking
english
styled
ipa
with
some
crisp
finish
and
balanced
mouthfeel
with
a
fair
amount
of
bitter
finish
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
could
knock
back
a
couple
of
these
but
probably
no
more
drinkability
is
very
good
nice
change
from
my
usual
ipas
might
have
to
pick
this
one
up
on
occasion
would
drink
six
in
a
row
thats
for
sure
only
bought
one
so
im
screwed
i
dont
get
the
monkey
thing
was
expecting
some
big
crazy
beer
with
the
clever
label
but
ended
up
with
just
a
pretty
simple
solid
beer
everything
about
the
beer
is
a
light
malt
smell
to
a
light
bready
taste
to
light
finish
but
very
very
drinkable
for
an
almost
7
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
left
hand
beers
ive
had
d
drinkability
is
good
here
id
have
this
beer
again
this
is
my
frist
beer
from
left
hand
brewing
compant
i
think
one
day
ill
just
pick
up
the
variety
pack
to
try
the
regular
lineup
dit
goes
down
easily
enough
but
there
is
not
a
lot
here
that
makes
me
want
to
have
another
medium
body
medium
effervescence
warming
on
the
palate
pretty
good
but
no
stand
out
before
sampling
this
ipa
i
tasted

and
the
freshness
and
smell
were
head
and
shoulders
above
the
400
pound
monkey
it
was
a
huge
let
down
after
sampling
the
stone
emperial
maybe
its
not
a
fair
comparison
but
i
was
very
disappointed
in
the
taste
of
this
ipa
overall
i
enjoyed
it
its
not
a
beer
im
going
to
boast
about
to
my
friends
to
try
will
i
buy
another
six
pack
or
order
it
at
a
bar
no
but
im
disappointed
i
tried
it
either
i
dont
drink
enough
english
ipas
to
be
able
to
say
that
it
is
or
is
not
within
that
style
though
i
suspect
it
may
be
a
bit
stronger
or
hoppier
than
the
style
would
prefer
but
its
a
solid
ipa
and
i
will
come
back
to
it
with
pleasure
d
drinkable
due
to
the
smoothness
and
malted
wheat
that
is
used
to
make
it
cheers
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
aroma
but
no
depth
to
the
flavor
the
hop
bitterness
is
present
and
accounted
for
but
there
isnt
any
hop
flavor
or
depth
just
a
kick
in
the
throat
d
decent
glad
i
tried
it
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
mild
tasting
and
very
drinkable
bottle
pours
a
hazed
golden
body
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
leaves
some
attractive
sticky
lace
aroma
is
mostly
citrusy
hops
that
though
a
bit
muted
have
a
nice
grapefruit
apricot
and
lemon
presence
a
hint
of
toasted
caramel
underneath
medium
body
and
carbonation
taste
has
some
apricot
sweetness
that
is
joined
by
bitter
grassy
hops
and
a
biscuity
malt
character
a
bit
of
caramel
pushes
the
taste
to
the
sweet
side
of
the
spectrum
alcohol
is
hidden
well
finish
is
clean
and
even
just
enough
hop
bitterness
to
avoid
cloying
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
but
the
name
doesnt
really
fit
dark
brown
color
with
some
cloudiness
and
a
weak
head
good
aroma
and
flavor
ill
probably
have
it
again
but
not
often
overall
nothing
too
special
imo
but
not
bad
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
one
again
but
ill
have
to
try
an
actual
english
ipa
sometime
to
see
how
it
compares
to
this
one
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
good
lacing
and
retention
throughout
minor
sweet
caramel
aroma
a
bit
of
citrus
as
well
very
faint
sweet
bread
and
caramel
malt
to
start
earthy
and
strong
pine
hops
hops
kick
in
next
which
lead
to
a
dry
finish
also
faint
alcohol
notes
decent
flavor
but
something
is
a
little
off
mouthfeel
is
nice
despite
the
dryness
overall
a
tasty
pumpedup
version
of
an
english
ipa
if
you
like
the
style
as
well
as
bolder
beers
then
youll
like
this
very
drinkable
beer
and
quite
enjoyable
just
remember
its
and
english
style
india
and
not
an
american
extremely
drinkable
the
feel
was
sharp
initially
from
generous
carbonation
it
was
slick
in
the
mouth
and
finished
dry
the
body
wasnt
lacking
yet
it
was
very
drinkable
the
beer
felt
a
little
light
for
the
style
i
expected
it
to
be
a
little
more
thick
for
a
medium
bodied
beer
the
beer
had
better
than
average
drinkability
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
one
i
would
defiantly
drink
again
d
ill
say
it
again
pretty
easy
to
drink
nothing
mind
blowing
but
a
decent
albeit
different
interpretation
of
an
ipa
not
really
for
hop
heads
because
it
isnt
up
to
that
level
of
hops
bitterness
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
yelloworange
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
rocky
lacking
that
lasts
a
while
the
aroma
some
tangerine
and
floral
notes
but
is
very
faint
for
an
english
ipa
the
taste
is
somewhat
stronger
but
not
much
there
are
is
some
tangerine
grapefruit
and
a
hint
of
flower
but
it
slides
across
the
tongue
and
disappears
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
that
is
a
little
too
low
and
a
sticky
texture
that
is
very
unappealing
in
an
ipa
this
beer
is
a
real
let
down
it
comes
across
as
being
very
noncohesive
and
i
think
that
is
a
extremely
bad
quality
for
a
beer
to
have
i
will
not
be
drinking
this
again
d
this
was
just
your
average
english
ipa
a
very
grainy
flavor
where
you
would
expect
some
sweetness
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
this
beer
is
pretty
much
all
over
the
place
balance
is
kooky
but
i
enjoyed
it
overall
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
smooth
as
it
goes
down
well
and
has
a
light
to
medium
body
to
it
it
is
more
balanced
than
expected
but
does
have
nice
bitter
aftertastes
that
last
just
long
enough
it
seems
fairly
balanced
in
the
taste
but
the
malt
and
hops
dont
really
play
off
one
another
the
gobetween
seems
labored
a
filmy
finish
allows
the
malt
to
control
the
beer
and
the
hops
just
sort
of
fade
to
the
background
with
only
a
touch
of
bitterness
this
isnt
bad
but
the
lack
of
smooth
transition
hurts
it
imho
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
excellent
head
retention
and
some
lacing
a
damn
nice
looking
beer
unfortunately
the
aroma
is
not
so
good
very
weak
and
faint
with
only
subtle
leafy
hops
the
taste
is
a
resinous
hop
bomb
with
plenty
of
pine
notes
very
faint
notes
of
caramel
and
bread
in
the
finish
medium
carbonated
bodied
with
a
good
hop
zing
dont
know
if
ill
get
it
again
for
10
but
not
a
bad
beer
a
pale
golden
color
pour
with
a
two
finger
foamy
whiye
head
medium
carbonation
aroma
is
of
earthy
spicy
hops
and
little
else
flavor
is
kind
of
a
mess
same
grassy
and
spicy
hops
as
the
aroma
with
kind
of
a
netral
malt
backbone
medium
body
oily
mouthfeel
short
hoppy
finish
light
bitterness
drinkable
but
just
odd
mouthfeel
was
good
not
too
much
carbonation
and
not
too
little
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
more
than
two
had
a
very
full
flavor
had
a
couple
of
eh
beers
from
left
hand
so
i
didnt
know
what
i
was
in
for
now
that
ive
had
this
and
the
sawtooth
in
the
past
week
id
say
lh
can
do
english
ales
well
and
id
drink
this
particular
beer
anytime
this
is
enjoyable
and
fairly
well
english
style
not
my
favorite
style
but
id
be
ok
having
another
light
body
with
some
dextrin
presence
and
modest
carbonation
this
beer
pours
a
bronze
toned
light
amber
color
and
has
a
nice
frothy
white
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
like
crazy
the
aroma
is
full
of
herbal
and
floral
hops
as
well
as
some
lemon
notes
it
also
carries
a
bit
of
grainy
pale
malt
sweetness
the
flavor
is
once
again
dominated
by
a
mix
of
earthy
herbal
floral
and
lemony
hops
that
seem
to
be
well
blended
the
malt
character
seems
a
bit
off
and
is
quite
grainy
this
beer
may
be
a
little
bit
too
bitter
for
relatively
small
malt
backbone
i
am
detecting
in
the
finish
there
is
a
very
interesting
buttery
nutty
sort
of
flavor
that
is
quite
nice
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
and
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
a
little
bit
watery
with
a
very
dry
finish
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
not
too
shabby
the
monkey
is
one
of
those
beers
youre
going
to
love
or
hate
and
it
turns
on
its
present
and
full
presentation
of
grassy
citrus
sharpness
and
how
you
dig
that
its
color
is
nice
with
a
quickly
deminishing
head
and
its
aroma
is
pleasant
with
citrus
im
not
one
for
tartness
or
too
much
grassyness
so
i
didnt
love
the
taste
or
the
aftertaste
that
sticks
with
you
for
a
few
great
example
of
an
english
ipa
would
make
a
stellar
session
brew
if
the
abv
was
slightly
lower
d
i
like
this
beer
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
up
again
d
really
a
solid
beer
not
an
english
ipa
based
on
the
flavor
profile
could
fit
as
a
hybrid
englishamerican
ipa
but
the
lack
of
malt
character
throws
me
off
on
this
one
id
like
to
try
this
again
on
tap
to
see
if
my
review
changes
with
the
plethora
of
ipa
choices
out
there
i
think
ill
pass
on
this
if
i
see
it
again
at
the
store
definitely
a
good
drinker
but
i
probably
couldnt
session
it
very
well
ill
be
revisiting
this
one
often
a
beautiful
thoughtful
beer
and
also
drinkable

abv

drinkable
though
i
was
surprised
how
noticeable
the
alcohol
was
not

aggressive
as
pnw
and
sd
style
ipas
but
a
nice
interpretation
attempt
to
create
officer
quality
eipa
worth
a
try
though
i
think
the
hops
have
faded
a
bit
in
this
three
month
old
bottle
pours
clear
on

encountered
the

12oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
d
this
beer
was
a
little
dry
for
my
taste
but
other
than
that
is
was
good
and
easy
to
drink
400
pound
monkey
has
the
look
and
flavor
of
a
maibock
followed
by
the
the
feel
of
an
ipa
its
too
bland
and
metallic
to
recommend
but
has
a
pretty
good
mouthfeel
that
makes
it
an
enjoyable
if
not
remarkable
experience
a
great
beer
that
i
got
the
chance
to
taste
this
brew
at
oliver
twist
when
it
first
got
in
to
sweden
its
a
great
beer
with
nice
top
foam
sits
for
a
moment
to
the
go
down
in
about
10
i
can
warmly
recommend
this
one
to
everyone
that
likes
a
good
eipa
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
400pound
monkey
by
any
means
but
i
rate
to
style
and
i
consider
this
one
of
the
best
english
ipas
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
wonderful
choice
for
when
you
want
the
lightness
and
refreshment
of
a
pilsner
but
would
also
prefer
the
malt
flavors
of
an
english
ale
d
wow
this
was
excellent
tastes
and
drinks
very
well
4
0
for
something
thats
supposed
to
be
striving
for
balance
i
dont
find
a
whole
lot
of
balance
here
the
metallic
hop
quality
throws
everything
else
off
this
needs
some
work
d
for
some
reason
i
was
expecting
a
powerful
hoppy
ipa
but
this
is
much
more
true
to
the
traditional
english
ipa
or
even
just
an
english
ale
it
was
really
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
with
more
malt
than
hops
but
i
couldnt
shake
the
thought
that
it
tasted
like
a
2
year
old
american
ipa
when
in
fact
it
was
only
2
months
old
not
bad
but
i
was
disappointed
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
ipa
that
would
be
easy
to
through
back
a
few
of
if
only
the
hops
profile
was
changed
a
bit
had
again
on
cask
at
fallen
rock
and
the
same
rating
though
a
bit
odd
bitterness
reminds
me
of
the
english
beers
that
first
drew
me
into
beer
drinking
though
more
hoppy
good
beer
id
like
to
try
other
things
from
left
hand
because
it
seems
like
this
was
brewed
nicely
and
tasted
very
fresh
for
what
it
was
just
not
my
favorite
style
overall
not
really
even
worth
trying
overall
a
fine
ipa
im
used
to
americanstyle
ipas
so
this
is
a
nice
diversion
it
poured
a
nice
dark
orange
a
good
sized
two
finger
head
the
auroma
has
a
strong
hops
presence
with
very
strong
malts
as
well
the
malts
were
the
thing
that
stood
out
the
most
in
this
beer
but
the
hops
were
soon
to
follow
i
was
pretty
surprised
by
how
forward
the
malts
were
in
this
ipa
but
it
balanced
very
well
it
has
a
pretty
full
body
with
a
nice
alcohol
burn
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
infact
i
wish
i
had
another
to
drink
right
now
lite
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
not
much
of
a
taste
to
talk
about
was
disappointed
after
reading
a
lot
of
good
things
about
lefthand
brewing
it
was
also
my
first
go
at
an
english
style
ipa
and
honestly
it
was
like
drinking
a
bud
lite
ill
give
the
english
style
another
shot
but
im
not
getting
my
hopes
up
d
a
decent
beer
i
thought
there
was
a
weird
mustiness
to
the
smell
that
kind
of
hurt
it
but
the
taste
was
some
solid
balanced
hops
and
malts
would
try
again
d
a
pretty
drinkable
offering
overall
not
mindblowing
but
id
drink
it
again
bought
at
r
and
r
stations
in
marion
its
unreached
potential
makes
it
seem
worse
than
it
is
subtle
but
punchy
in
all
the
right
places
left
hand
chose
a
somewhat
overlooked
style
and
ended
up
with
a
tasty
but
not
overthetop
experience
thats
hard
to
find
too
much
fault
with
tastes
like
a
combination
of
the
aforementioned
aromas
only
more
beery
starts
off
with
a
rustic
thick
barley
thats
similar
sam
adams
the
middle
is
very
thick
but
still
somehow
light
and
fruity
and
it
finishes
off
on
a
blend
of
very
dry
european
hops
and
a
chewy
bready
yeast
note
solid
combination
all
very
nicely
balanced
medium
body
with
ample
carbonation
little
alcohol
heat
combined
with
the
flavor
it
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
id
have
it
again
but
wish
it
was
tweaked
drinkability
another
brew
that
i
cant
get
into
because
of
the
lack
of
harmony
with
the
flavours
1
bottle
and
im
done
for
good
the
balance
seems
perfect
and
i
could
easily
see
this
being
a
goto
beer
for
me
if
i
didnt
have
to
drive
out
of
state
to
get
it
fortunately
i
have
five
bottles
left
bright
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
white
head
that
fell
relatively
quickly
but
there
was
some
nice
rings
of
lacing
left
down
the
sam
adams
perfect
pint
herbal
grassy
and
orange
hop
aromas
jump
out
first
followed
by
a
semisweet
cracker
toasty
bread
maltiness
nice
balance
in
the
nose
and
if
this
is
any
indication
of
the
taste
ill
be
pleasantly
surprised
yep
great
balance
here
im
really
digging
the
lightly
toasted
cracker
biscuitlike
maltiness
of
this
brew
which
is
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
lightly
bitter
herbal
hops
that
have
just
a
touch
of
citrus
on
the
back
end
namely
some
orange
marmaladelike
juiciness
drys
out
on
the
finish
with
a
decent
bitter
aftertaste
body
is
crisp
with
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
i
really
do
love
the
balance
i
really
wish
i
could
find
an
english
bitter
or
mild
pale
with
this
kind
of
flavor
on
a
regular
basis
if
this
thing
weighed
in
at
5
abv
or
less
it
would
be
one
of
the
best
session
brews
around
but
im
really
digging
it
the
way
it
is
not
sure
why
the
scores
are
so
low
on
this
one
i
think
its
a
very
wellmade
english
ipa
and
a
much
needed
break
from
the
often
overthetop
aipas
this
is
easy
to
drink
but
not
my
favorite
style
d
very
drinkable
and
very
moderate
abv
make
it
a
very
good
seeions
beer
cheers
goes
down
super
easy
atruly
nice
beer
cheers
overall
a
really
good
beer
that
breaks
away
from
the
current
trend
of
citrusy
american
ipas
great
balance
of
malt
and
hop
make
this
beer
highly
drinkable
d
great
to
sip
on
a
nice
offering
from
left
hand
not
to
mention
a
really
cool
label
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
highly
drinkable
possibly
a
little
too
drinkable
for
its
abv
but
overall
quite
a
nice
package
not
crazy
about
the
crackerlike
character
it
lands
between
english
and
american
it
does
have
a
hoppy
character
to
it
its
an
interesting
brew
400

no

its
still
got
some
weight

it

if
it

styled
it
would
be
made
in

solid
and
drinkable

could
have

of

i
could
and
would
drink
this
if
i
had
to
but
im
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
i
love
a
bitter
ipa
but
not
bitterness
without
good
hops
flavor
this
one
needs
some
work
overall
very
accurate
in
english
ipa
style
with
the
hops
more
subdued
and
very
balanced
for
an

the

i

almost

the

were
better
didnt
seem
that
english
to
me
i
expect
more
of
a
soft
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
d
a
decent
ipa
and
when
reviewing
i
wanted
to
keep
in
mind
that
this
is
the
english
style
rather
than
the
american
i
however
found
this
beer
to
be
a
mix
of
the
two
sort
of
there
was
a
lot
of
piney
citrus
hops
as
well
as
some
of
the
earthy
spicy
hops
you
find
in
an
english

decent
but
a
little
off
style
d
im
glad
i
only
got
a
single
d
very
easy

is
pretty
potent

well
hidden
perhaps
on
the
low
side
for
the
style
not

flavors
are
not

this
much
bitterness
can
get
to
you
in

feel

i
couldnt
get
much
from
this
beer
it
seemed
a

bland
maybe
the
composition
was
to
balanced
that
nothing
really
stuck
out
overall
i
was
disappointed
with
this
english
ipa
as
it
did
not
resemble
one

next

in

ill
check
these
guys
out
and
this
beer
too
theres
a
sort
of
earthy
dankness
that
even
translates
to
the
feel
though
it
doesnt
weigh
down
the

or
take
away
from

that
also
translates

a
little

and
a
bit

the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
but
it
doesnt
have
a
huge
amount
of
the
depth
of
an

it
does
have
a
nice

definitely
can
tell
it
is
an

glad
i
bought
the

so
i
absolutely
love
picking
up
their
offerings
ive
had
this
brew
ontap

that
seemed
to
be
eons
better
than
the
bottle
for
what
it
is

is
a
solid

that
feels

recommend
this

would
have
it
again
to
dig
a

deeper
the
taste
is
good
which
is
a
surprise
based
on
the
smell
mix
of
sweet
caramel
with
a
light
yeast
up
front
leads
to
more
of
an
herbal

with
slight

which
seems
to
blend
the
hop
and
yeast
flavors
with
a
mild
spice
element
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
pretty
drinkable
could
use
more
hop
flavor

real

aggressive

overall
this
is
a
brew
i
will
continue
to
buy
and
likely
to
try
more
from
the
brewer
balanced
would
be
the
word
i
use
to
best
describe
this
ipa
appearance
is
copper
with
golden
edges
the
two
fingers
of
head
stays
around
for
some
time
and
leave
nice
lacing
in
its
wake
the
nose
is
distinctly
fresh
hops
the
flavor
profile
blends
mild
malts
with
a
pleasant
but
slightly
too
mild
hop
finish
there
is
also
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness
on
the
finish
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
englishstyle
ipa
but
it
is
likely
too
mild
to
appeal
to
the
advanced
hophead
this
beer
is
great
its
pretty
much
on
par
with
their
dipa
which
i
love
but
the
lower
abv
would
make
this
more
session
able
regardless
yards
impresses
me
every
time
this
is
a
very
pleasant
blend
of
english
and
american
ipa
styles
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
plenty
of
hop
character
without
an
excessive
bitter
friendly
yet
firm
this
is
a
beer
i
could
go
for
again
and
again
i
am
going
to
go
out
on
the
limb
and
call
it
sessionable
because
it
doesnt
wreck
the
palate
and
because
it
has
a
very
casual
flavor
that
i
really
like
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
an
excellent
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
pours
a
light
amber
but
looks
flat
some
head
but
very
little
some
lace
somehow
smells
a
bit
better
than
a
typical
english
ipa
tastes
and
feels
like
an
english
ipa
which
isnt
my
usual
choice
but
this
worked
well
overall
not
bad
not
great
but
not
bad
i
had
this
beer
on

at
the

restaurant
in
bern
township
pa
and
was
impressed
with
the
golden
amber
color
good
foam
head
but
the
bubbles
dissipated
quickly
the
lacing
was
thick
with
good
retention
on
the
glass
the
bouqet
was
lacking
for
my
taste
with
just
a
very
faint
smell
of
citrus
but
not
enough
to
distinguish
anything
in
particular
the
flavor
is
very
good
with
a
good
hop
presence
on
the
front
and
a
malty
almost
biscuity
lingering
bitter
tangerine
finish
on
the
back
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
much
for
me
it
filled
me
up
quickly
overall

this

at

i
find

capable
of
satisfying
a

connoisseur
hop
head
as
well
im
giving
this
a
strong
4

out

5
cheers
yards
decent
gets
better
as
you
drink
not
prototypical
in
the
way
that
it
should
be
more
malty
or
that
the
maltiness
would
have
that
certain
signature
o
very
enjoyable
easy
going
ipa
its
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
but
the
fruity
hops
come
in
and
lend
nice
balance
making
this
a
tasty
drinkable
beer
distinctly
english
ipa
flavors
but
with
a
bit
more
oomph
a
little
strong
on
the
earthiness
i
think
but
pretty
solid
overall
i
liked
this
on
draft
but
id
not
buy
this
bottled
again
due
to
a
stale
edgy
sharp
off
taste
that
reminds
me
of
the
morning
after
frat
basement
you
can
certainly
taste
an
influence
from
the
englisheuro
yeast
strain
that
must
be
used
here
dark
fruits
and
spices
full

and
wellrounded

this
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
english
ipa
drinkable
and
refreshing
citrus
flavoring
hops
and
bitterness
dominate
no
real
off
flavors
but
bitterness
lingers
a
but
much
for
my
taste
floral
notes
and
earthiness
are
present
but
are
overridden
by
citrus
o
id
have
this
again
a
nice
ipa
for
the
non
hopheads
o
it
really
doesnt
have
too
much
of
an
english
ipa
feel
but
the
malts
on
the
backend
give
it
that
a
nice
beer
to
watch
football
with
though
enjoyed
this
always
impressed
with
yards
o
a
really
nice
beer
that
has
very
nice
balance
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
and
will
pick
it
up
again
i
have
not
had
many
english
ipas
and
esbs
but
the
kind
of
falls
some
where
between
the
few
beers
that
i
have
tried
in
those
styles
and
i
really
like
it
overall
a
pretty
good
more
on
the
bitter
side
ipa
good
but
nothing
extraordinary
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
great
to
keep
in
the
fridge
year
round
o
i
much
prefer
american
ipas
over
english
styled
ones
but
this
is
probably
the
best
english
style
ipa
i
have
ever
had
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
very
tasty
and
well
balanced
for
an
ipa
bottled
in
march
2012
dark
copper
orange
in
color
with
a
yellow
hue
and
good
clarity
poured
with
a
short
rocky
offwhite
foam
with
good
staying
power
the
foam
slowly
reduced
to
a
thick
cap
that
left
sheets
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
pungent
citrus
hop
aroma
with
orange
ripe
pineapple
and
grapefruit
a
light
caramel
and
biscuit
maltiness
manages
to
show
through
as
well
mediumbodied
with
lazy
but
rich
full
carbonation
pungent
mix
of
ripe
citrus
and
floral
hop
flavors
right
up
front
and
through
the
middle
hop
flavors
abruptly
drop
away
leaving
only
bitterness
through
the
middle
to
the
end
although
the
citrusy
aromas
linger
throughout
finishes
dry
with
a
lightly
sweet
caramel
maltiness
and
tapering
hop
bitterness
lots
of
character
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
beer
is
mostly
hops
and
the
associated
floral
hop
taste
there
is
a
good
mix
of
bitter
and
floral
hops
as
well
as
a
few
malts
as
well
o
another
good
one
from
yards
their
pale
at
least
on
tap
is
amazing
its
hoppy
but
not
over
the
top
dont
get
me
wrong
these
taste
buds
enjoy
a
good
walloping
but
at
7
abv
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
if
you
want
a
good
buzz

with

floral
and
citrus
hops
dominate
the
flavor
at
first
before
giving
way
to

base
some
piney
notes
are
present
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
slightly
sticky
with
a
good
amount
of

pretty
easy
drinking
a
nice
take
on
the
style
but
nothing
extraordinary
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
and
would
drink
more
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
o
smells
nice
but
doesnt
last
long
flavor
doesnt
match
aroma
doesnt
compare
well
to
other
ipas
like
stone
or
avery
yards
ipa
is
a
tremendous
ipa
and
one
of
my
favorites
for
a
long
time
now
it
pours
a
nice
rich
amber
in
a
pint
with
a
great
offwhite
head
this
is
a
very
english
ipa
and
that
is
what
i
love
plenty
of
malt
and
rich
citrusy
hops
with
each
sip
i
consider
a
thinking
mans
ipa
with
plenty
of
zip
but
enough
to
contemplate
and
enjoy
a
great
beer
o
solid
ipa
even
with
the
british
designation
even
though
the
malts
can
be
strong
and
thick
at
times
the
resinous
hops
always
come
out
on
top
o
very
well
done
english
ipa
from
yet
another
great
eastern
pa
brewery
i
like
the
combination
of
citrus
and
english
malt
very
smooth
and
perfectly
hopped
overall
this
beer
is
just
okay
not
much
to
say
kind
of
bland
probably
wont
purchase
due
to
to
many
other
good
beers
out
there
o
a
very
good
beer
try
it

thanks
sis
o
solid
english
ipa
was
expecting
a
little
more
bitterness
but
an
unknown
freshness
can
be
more
the
culprit
overall
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
definitely
try
again
it
reminds
me
of
a
more
malty
version
of
their
philadelphia
pale
ale
clear
as
day
golden
straw
color
with
a
huge
white
headed
foamy
pour
big
soapy
and
grassy
hop
aroma
head
is
slowly
but
surely
snailing
away
very
sticky
lace
flavor
has
some
semisweet
grainy
malt
on
the
front
end
with
a
big
herbal
and
grassy
presence
pretty
well
balanced
sweetness
is
subtle
and
so
is
the
hop
bitterness
pretty
nice
yet
subdued
for
an
ipa
carbonation
is
on
the
mediumlow
side
body
is
kind
of
average
but
there
is
an
appealing
creaminess
here
very
much
in
the
british
mold
this
is
an
antiwest
coast
ipa
the
brewerys
philadelphia
pale
ale
is
markedly
hoppier
and
more
contemporary
in
both
style
and
taste
fresh
bottle
pours
fruity
hazy
orange
with
immense
retained
head
in
my
sam
adams
glass
easy
drinking
medium
bodied
orange
hoppy
flavoured
with
a
pinch
of
fruit
pretty
good
for
the
style
something
i
would
recommend
people
try
something
i
would
keep
regular
in
the
fridge
if
available
locally
taste
doesnt
really
taste
like
an
ipa
but
i
guess
if
it
is
going
for
a
traditional
english
ipa
type
it
hits
the
mark
good
beer
nonetheless
at
7
and
hopped
up
with
citrus
flavors
im
not
sure
what
makes
this
ipa
english
rather
than
american
maybe
english
malts
regardless
of
classification
this
is
a
delicious
and
well
crafted
ale
the
big
sticky
head
and
full
fluid
body
complement
the
balanced
palate
and
hoppy
nose
perfectly
a
worthy
ipa
overall
really
great
tasting
beer
rather
liking
this
one
and
a
nice
take
on
the
style
very
enjoyable
would
have
again
no
problem
o
while
this
beer
does
have
some
good
qualities
it
falls
short
in
some
key
areas
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
clear
orange
yellow
in
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
while
smell
bready
and
citrusy
oily
taste
dry
bitter
hops
then
going
to
more
citrusy
oily
balanced
out
with
some
malt
sweetness
backbone
dry
bitter
finish
simple
enough
to
be
drinkable
but
complex
enough
to
be
interesting
reminds
me
of
a
beefier
sam
smith
india
ale
very
good
beer
nice
not
must
have
i
have
been
slacking
in
not
reviewing
this
before
so
i
figured
now
that
i
had
it
on
tap
at
home
it
is
time
to
review
it
a
very
nice
ipa
that
is
really
really
drinkable
and
wont
pound
your
mouth
with
hops
nice
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
to
the
style
a
tasty
brew
i
would
try
it
again
especially
if
i
can
find
it
fresh
on
tap
had
this
one
at
a
small
local
brew
fest
i
made
the
mistake
of
having
it
right
after
having
a
double
ipa
right
before
it
however
i
must
say
that
despite
that
i
though
the
brew
was
pretty
impressive
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
light
golden
amber
color
with
a
pretty
decent
looking
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
pretty
nice
balance
between
malts
and
hops
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
some
good
caramel
flavors
in
it
and
a
crisp
hop
bite
also
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
easy
going
overall
i
think
this
ipa
is
a
good
social
brew
where
someone
can
have
several
of
them
and
still
have
their
taste
buds
to
try
other
things
if
need
be
a
pretty
standard
offering
nothing
you
havent
seen
or
tasted
before
but
its
still
yards
and
still
good
pours
a
golden
yellow
notably
carbonation
and
slightly
hazy
with
a
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
aroma
and
taste
are
pretty
handinhand
a
sweet
caramel
base
generously
overlaid
with
citrusy
and
piney
hops
medium
body
a
bit
filmy
but
generally
drinkable
and
a
fairly
good
example
of
the
style
despite
being
outside
the
country
of
origin
pours
a
hazy
orangegold
color
with
about
a
centimeter
of
white
head
that
fades
fast
smells
of
grapefruit
pine
orange
and
lemon
peels
and
hops
tastes
similar
with
an
initial
emphasis
on
grapefruit
and
other
citrus
flavors
followed
by
a
weird
almost
soapy
middle
ends
with
a
delicious
hoppy
bitter
finish
mouth
is
bitter
and
dry
overall
a
good
ipa
o
i
could
definitely
throw
back
a
few
of
these
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
brew
o
easy
drinking
solid
beer
enjoyed
it
after
work
today
while
sitting
on
my
deck
perfect
for
a
nice
sunny
day
o
overall
this
is
a
well
done
eipa
very
balanced
drinkable
and
enjoyable
overall
a
really
good
ipa
i
like
this
i
think
their
pale
ale
is
much
better
with
a
lot
more
character
however
im
not
all
that
well
versed
on
english
ipas
but
i
enjoy
this
quite
a
bit
not
bad
at
all
the
first
time
i
tried
it
not
overly
hoppy
decent
texture
and
smoothness
to
it
normal
appearance
for
an
ipa
not
he
best
ipa
but
far
from
the
worst
having
it
by
the
shore
in
wildwood
nj
helped
though
good
paired
with
a
sloppy
cheeseburger
taste
is
orange
and
bitter
perfectly
reminiscent
of
english
style
brews
overall
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops

theres
one
complaint
there
could
maybe
be
a
tad
more

to
make

6th
and
moore
south
philly
o
not
a
bad
beer
not
necessarily
better
than
other
ipas
from
the
area
but
different
than
most
east
coast
ipas
plus
its
super
drinkable
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
mildly
hoppy
on
the
midpalate
region
the
hoppiness
gives
way
ultimately
to
a
heavy
finish
with
a
strong
malt
sweetness
thats
not
the
right
word
its
heavier
on
the
back
half
than
the
front
half
overall
its
a
decent
eipa
but
i
doubt
id
drink
too
much
of
it
overall
pretty
tasty
ipa
i
would
keep
coming
back
to
this
one
overall
go
buy
this
beer
im
partial
since
this
is
a
local
brew
and
i
met
the
owner
a
few
years
back
and
he
seemed
like
a
pretty
cool
guy
but
all
of
that
stuff
aside
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
this
is
a
goto
ipa
for
me
and
i
would
recommend
it
anyone
along
with
most
other
yards
brews
definitely
a
beer
you
can
drink
a
few
of
very
drinkable
i
like
the
touch
of
caramel
malt
flavor
to
back
up
the
big
hop
bitterness
hv
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
taste
is
of
obvious
amarillo
hops
which
is
unexpected
for
an
english
ipa
not
as
much
malt
sweetness
as
expected
which
i
like
there
is
something
present
in
the
flavor
that
i
do
not
like
slightly
medicinal
flavor
i
just
cant
put
my
finger
on
overall
this
is
a
tasty

that
i
could

this

could
not
resist
telling
the
forum
about

i
think
youll
agree
this

is
fantastic

very
tasty

a
somewhat
milder

definetely
work
picking
up

i
can
see
myself
drinking
again
in
the
future
if
youre
a
fan
of
esbs

ipas
that
are
more
on
the
earthy
side

might
be
something
you
want
to
check
out

a
thoroughly
invigorating
jolt
of

have
this

so
damn
difficult
not
to
down
it
with
authority
consistently
very
tasty
alcohol

vaguely
present
at

end

it
doesnt
come
close

with
some
nice
floral
herbal
and
citrus
components
taste
isnt
quite
as
hoppy
and
adds
in
a
touch
of
caramel
dry
and
bitter
a
bit
resinous
drinks
quite
well
their
best
offering
imo
d
okay
not
a
wonderful
ipa
but
its
drinkable
i
would
choose
many
other
ipas
over
this
one
wow
have
had
this
brew
in
bottles
many
times
and
always
dug
it
tonight
had
on
draft
while
enjoying
a
sheppards
pie
fantastic
delicious
sweet
tropical
fruit
and
killer
hop
nose
taste
follows
suit
fresh
on
tap
this
is
a
killer
brew
ill
be
back
at
same
bar
tomorrow
for
more
really
a
terrific
ipa
that
falls
more
toward
american
vs
english
go
find
a
tap
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
nice
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
d
all
too
drinkable
a
wonderfully
wellbalanced
ipa
that
union
jack
on
the
label
should
leave
no
confusion
as
to
its
stylings
but
the
generic
ipa
might
lead
one
to
expect
an
even
more
powerful
dose
of
hops
more
like
we
yanks
are
used
to
in
that
regard
this
performs
well
amply
hopped
and
full
of
citrus
7
hides
very
nicely
too
sure
id
love
to
have
more
d
could
always
drink
this
very
nice
ipa
from
philly
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
glass
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
2
finger
white
head
it
smells
more
like
an
american
ipa
than
and
english
it
has
big
tangy
citrus
on
the
nose
the
flavor
has
lots
of
herbal
and
citrus
notes
and
a
nice
long
bitter
finish
it
is
medium
in
body
and
well
carbonated
a
very
solid
offering
drinkability
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
6
pack
of
these
the
7
is
nowhere
to
be
found
i
was
surprised
it
was
that
high
seemed
more
like
4
5
to
me
great
beer
i
could
enjoy
at
any
time
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
generously
sized
frumpy
head
with
excellent
retention
the
head
gradually
settles
in
bubbly
clumps
like
islands
in
a
sea
the
nose
is
very
hoppy
wtih
strong
and
appealing
tropical
fruity
notes
and
orange
zest
dominating
the
aromas
sweet
caramelly
malt
aromas
bring
up
the
rear
not
a
whiff
of
alcohol
despite
the
high
abv
smell
is
very
enticing
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
tastes
is
good
if
somewhat
simple
citrus
zest
hits
the
front
palate
before
sweet
caramelly
malts
dominate
the
middle
the
finish
lingers
long
with
flavors
like
mandarins
and
butterscotch
all
in
all
this
is
one
of
my
very
favorite
everyday
ipas
the
beer
is
a
nice
clear
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
remains
most
the
way
through
drinking
while
the
head
is
smallish
it
leaves
nice
lacing
aroma
is
piney
hops
bitter
that
carries
into
the
taste
as
loads
of
hops
is
the
main
flavor
but
really
the
only
flavor
i
detect
the
carbonation
is
moderate
the
body
average
for
the
style
unfortunately
too
unbalanced
for
me
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
d
sessionable
with
a
lower
apv
definitely
a
different
taste
for
an
ipa
but
welcomed
poured
a
dark
amber
cloudy
color
thin
head
not
as
hoppy
as
im
used
to
for
an
ipa
british
malts
stand
out
some
initial
sweetness
maybe
some
apricot
or
grapefruit
notes
crisp
with
subtle
carbonation
im
not
a
big
fan
of
english
ipas
but
this
was
ok
d
extremely
balanced
and
goes
down
deceptively
easy
for
a
7
abv
ill
readily
admit
that
im
a
big
fan
of
west
coast
ipas
but
this
is
a
great
change
of
pace
poured
into
an
american
pint
glass
cloudy
amber
with
one
finger
of
white
and
good
lacing
smelled
of
pine
bitter
herbs
and
grass
tasted
initially
of
pine
and
bitter
herbs
then
dissolved
to
apple
and
citrus
finishing
on
a
sweetish
note
very
nice
and
surprising
flavor
progression
medium
bodied
not
overly
carbonated
well
hidden
alcohol
content
has
you
thinking
that
this
is
a
great
session
ipa
d
overall
this
brew
hits
an
interesting
spot
between
english
and
american
ipa
with
the
musky
malty
aroma
saturated
in
orange
herbal
hoppiness
d
if
you
have
an
appreciation
for
the
english
ipa
this
yards
is
an
excellent
highly
drinkable
choice
the
hops
and
malts
are
both
big
and
they
are
balanced
well
im
surprised
by
my
own
ratings
here
but
this
is
one
solid
brew
and
i
stand
by
them
d
you
definitely
should
grab
a
friend
to
share
a
6
pack
with
because
drinking
one
by
yourself
might
seem
more
like
a
chore
than
a
pleasure
overall
a
really
solid
and
quite
sessionable
ipa
would
not
mind
having
this
one
again
at
all
pours
a
lightly
cloudy
copper
orange
color
with
large
white
creamy
head
and
fair
lacing
straw
like
malt
flavor
citrus
fruity
hop
smelltaste
is
the
same
plus
some
piney
perfume
hints
light
body
thin
slick
texture
and
lively
carbonation
slight
bitter
finish
with
a
short
flavor
duration
could
throw
this
beer
back
all
night
long
this
is
a
very
good
brew
the
first
of
many
i
will
enjoy
from
this
local
brewery
very
good
to
session
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poiurs
a
hazy
coppery
color
witha
nice
two
finger
head
the
smell
and
taste
are
dominated
by
a
nice
citrusy
hoppy
flavor
very
smoothe
beer
for
7
abv
this
would
be
a
beer
which
you
could
very
easily
have
too
many
i
would
definitely
drink
again
12
oz
brown
bottle
with
no
indication
of
freshness
poured
into
a
pint
appears
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
less
than
a
finger
of
slightly
yellowish
stained
fluffy
foam
for
a
head
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
and
minor
powers
of
retension
aroma
of
this
beer
is
a
pleasant
mixture
of
citrus
hops
that
lean
slightly
towards
almost
an
orangelike
fruit
character
and
a
bit
of
malt
candylike
sweetness
backing
in
the
nose
mixed
in
there
is
a
bit
of
yeast
character
as
well
taste
is
pleasantly
bitter
with
a
good
amount
of
hop
flavors
that
again
present
themselves
with
a
bit
of
bitter
orange
rind
type
of
taste
flavors
also
included
are
a
bit
of
citrus
and
grass
medium
to
light
feel
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
fair
amount
of
malt
sweetness
compliments
the
bitterness
nicely
this
is
an
overall
nicely
well
rounded
beer
the
hops
linger
in
the
mouth
with
their
bitterness
being
slightly
exaggerated
by
the
alcohol
warmth
that
is
present
d
this
wont
jump
on
you
right
away
but
this
is
a
very
wellbrewed
ipa
flavorful
and
hoppy
without
an
intense
bitterness
definitely
recommended
a
really
pleasant
drinker
drinkability
an
excellent
beer
and
easy
to
drink
much
of
it
good
pairing
with
spicy
foods
another
fine
pale
ale
from
yards
well
done
this
poured
a
clear
dark
gold
with
moderate
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
pine
and
grapefruit
and
orange
zest
with
a
bit
of
honey
malt
and
peppercorn
it
tasted
like
pine
and
grapefruit
and
orange
zest
with
a
little
light
caramel
malt
it
was
slightly
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
good
but
simple
flavor
although
it
got
a
bit
dirty
in
the
lingering
aftertaste
it
had
a
nice
body
and
was
easy
enough
to
drink
an
enjoyable
ipa
but
ultimately
mediocre
d
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
although
the
hops
might
get
a
little
too
much
for
me
after
quite
a
few
a
very
good
beer
to
enjoy
a
few
of
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
a
very
nice
tasting
and
drinking
ipa
i
would
love
a
case
of
this
dangerous
stuff
given
the
abv
very
good
really
an
interesting
ipa
never
really
had
an
english
ipa
before
this
one
and
im
pleased
with
the
product
id
definitely
purchase
this
again
medium
body
and
as
drinkable
as
any
american
ipa
d
this
beer
ha
a
big
glorious
full
hops
flavor
with
good
depth
and
layers
of
hops
making
this
a
nice
sipping
ipa
pours
hazy
copper
with
fluffy
head
aroma
has
a
promising
piny
hop
aroma
flavor
however
is
fairly
mild
with
a
smooth
carmelly
taste
with
a
slight
toasted
nut
character
like
almonds
a
little
whiff
of
banana
ester
comes
through
but
a
deep
piny
bitterness
redeems
it
though
it
develops
slowly
mouthfeel
is
creamy
d
really
great
easy
drinking

inch

settles
into
a
fairly
consistent
skim
that
coalesces
around
the

thick
strands
of

were
revealed

exhibited
excellent

a
biscuity
quality
with
a
detectable
hops
presence
in
the
back
somewhere
between
piny

taste
consistent
with

however
the
hops
comes
out
upfront
on
a

a
little
bit
of
alcohol
comes
out
in
the
mix
as
well

and
a

effervescence
tasty
brew
ive
found
the
english
ipas
ive
tried
to
be
hit
or
miss
but
this
one
is
really
excellent
well
worth
your
time
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
give
it
a
shot
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
standard
shaker
glass
the
ale
appears
a
hazed
muted
amber
color
with
about
a
finger
of
creamy
off
white
foam
aromas
and
flavors
consist
of
a
nice
balance
of
caramel
malts
citrus
and
piney
hops
lightly
toasted
bread
a
bit
earthy
with
more
malt
sweetness
than
your
average
ipa
but
it
works
for
this
beer
the
ale
is
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
levels
with
no
noticeable
alcohol
heat
certainly
worth
a
try
d
7
is
definitely
a
surprise
drinks
pretty
easy
and
is
pretty
tasty
even
if
it
really
isnt
to
the
eipa
style
d
this
is
a
really
nice
english
ipa
yards
has
done
a
great
job
in
my
opinion
with
brewing
traditional
styles
this
one
gives
you
some
hops
but
provides
a
strong
malt
presence
as
well
d
very
good
loved
it
im
not
by
any
means
an
ipa
junkie
and
so
i
dont
drink
them
enough
to
call
myself
well
versed
in
the
style
but
this
is
my
favorite
ipa
that
ive
ever
head
save
for
maybe
the
dogfish
head
90
minute
hides
the
abv
well
this
would
make
a
good
gateway
beer
for
nonhopheads
into
the
style
served
at
the
perfect
temperature
just
below
room
temperature
it
allowed
the
fruit
and
malt
flavors
of
this
beer
to
bloom
and
express
dont
drink
and
review
md
nice
light
mouthfeel
is
not
sticky
flavor
lingers
easily
drinkable
this
beer
is
as
balanced
an
ipa
can
get
never
one
sided
and
quite
smooth
is
pretty
light
feel
as
well
personally
this
is
my
kind
of
ipa
i
believer
that
because
yards
understand
the
brewing
of
bitters
and
are
students
of
history
they
pay
careful
attention
to
brew
a
ipa
that
it
is
a
complex
tasting
hoppy
beverage
as
opposed
to
a
onenote
citrus
blast
to
your
tastebuds
pours
a
hazy
light
amber
color
with
unfiltered
particulate
and
a
shallow
foamy
head
and
that
fades
fairly
quickly
spotty
patterns
of
lacing
left
behind
the
smell
is
timid
but
sweet
and
floral
visibly
effervescent
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
and
creamy
with
less
zip
that
the
bubbles
suggest
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
lightly
hoppy
a
reasonable
drinker
thanks
out
to
corb112
for
this
extra
d
very
good
balance
and
session
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
a
decent
ipa
full
bodied
and
delicious
im
so
sad
this
is
the
last
one
in
the
case
overal
good
but
to
follow
the
style
its
not
good
dr
very
good
i
could
drink
several
of
these
if
i
could
keep
awake
mouthfeel
is
filling
and
enjoyable
i
would
enjoy
having
more
of
these
ona
regular
basis
cask
at
union
jacks
yards
ipa
holds
a
bright
golden
color
with
off
orange
tints
topped
with
a
white
head
quite
nice
off
the
firkin
smells
of
floral
hops
with
some
grapefruit
and
slight
pine
backed
by
a
good
malt
base
taste
the
same
with
a
slight
bitterness
but
not
over
the
top
since
this
is
an
english
version
ipa
a
great
feel
from
the
cask
smooth
and
brisk
with
a
abv
not
over
the
top
leaving
it
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
more
ive
yet
to
try
a
bottle
from
yards
since
they
changed
location
but
this
intrigued
me
to
search
them
out
again
d
a
solid
offering
from
yards
but
not
a
very
memorable
one
hides
the
7
abv
exteremely
well
solid
in
all
categories
a
richer
fuller
slightly
more
carbonated
mouthfeel
would
add
greatly
to
this
brew
none
the
less
i
would
gladly
welcome
the
chance
to
revisit
smell
is
somewhat
floral
hops
but
theres
a
very
barley
like
wet
grass
smell
as
well
not
so
sure
about
that
its
a
little
off
putting
taste
is
more
of
the
same
some
more
wet
and
moldy
barley
or
spent
grains
a
decent
amount
of
bitterness
in
the
mouthfeel
a
mix
between
an
esb
and
a
pale
ale
decent
beer
but
i
prefer
the
american
or
better
yet
californian
version
not
what
i
think
of
when
i
see
an
ipa
but
it
is
worth
a
try
for
sure
drinkability
tastes
good
good
mouthfeel
recommended
im
usually
a
little
skeptic
on
ipas
but
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
very
smooth
to
me
this
is
a
really
good
ipa
from
yards
since
i
live
so
close
ill
definitely
be
sampling
more
from
this
brewery
the
taste
is
good
and
is
strong
on
malt
then
finishes
with
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
for
a
beer
that
is
7
it
hides
the
alocohol
well
a
good
ipa
and
good
on
price
its
not
too
much
29
99
plus
tax
for
a
case
my
cheap
goto
brew
isnt
so
cheap
anymore
oh
well
like
goes
on
appearance
is
amber
and
mostly
clear
with
some
suspension
smell
is
hoppy
citrus
pine
and
earthy
aromas
and
a
bready
malt
presence
as
well
taste
is
hoppy
but
more
subtle
than
an
american
ipa
and
a
good
caramellike
sweetness
as
well
alcohol
remains
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
hefty
due
to
abv
but
not
overly
so
good
carbonation
level
but
not
quite
crisp
finish
is
bitter
and
dry
drinkability
is
very
good
ahhh
refreshing
and
relaxing
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
went
through
the
first
one
so
fast
i
had
to
pour
another
one
for
this
review
a
good
everyday
ipa
that
wont
assault
you
into
a
hop
coma
poured
strong
down
the
middle
of
a
smallish
tulip
huge
head
that
drained
away
quickly
some
lacing
but
not
much
nice
caramel
color
based
on
what
others
have
said
about
this
beer
i
chose
to
let
this
sit
a
bit
to
force
of
some
of
the
carbonation
and
to
warm
it
to
traditional
british
serving
temps
the
nose
has
a
slight
maltyness
and
a
strong
bitter
hop
scent
id
guess
lemon
pledge
with
a
bit
of
pear
at
the
end
the
flavor
is
of
toasty
malts
a
bit
of
biscuit
with
a
medium
hop
finish
there
are
hints
of
esters
and
alcohol
this
is
not
your
traditional
american
ipa
much
more
like
a
traditional
british
style
i
am
glad
i
let
the
carbonation
wane
as
it
is
still
a
bit
frothy
another
good
beer
from
the
folks
at
yards
d
the
7
abv
is
hard
to
detect
but
im
sure
after
a
few
of
these
would
be
noticeable
fairly
drinkable
but
i
probably
wouldnt
be
picking
up
more
than
one
of
these
in
an
evening
id
say
yards
has
settled
nicely
into
the
new
brewery
and
hope
they
continue
for
years
to
come
now
it
is
time
for
them
to
start
putting
a
bottled
on
or
freshness

on
their
beers
mouthfeel

and
carbonation

pretty
low
relatively
easy
to
drink
i
thought
this
was
well
rounded
and
delicious
poured
into
a
large
guinness
pint
glass
nice
thick
creamy
head
and
the
beer
itself
is
of
deep
gold
hue
light
grassy
fruity
hops
dominate
the
aroma
but
there
is
a
bready
hint
of
grain
behind
it
all
a
hint
of
bubblegum
as
well
taste
is
herbalgrassy
hops
with
just
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
behind
it
to
balance
it
as
well
as
a
slight
tannicgrainy
flavor
the
bitterness
lingers
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
carbonation
and
the
body
is
a
tad
on
the
light
side
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
for
one
or
two
but
overall
it
comes
across
as
a
bit
abrasive
a
good
take
on
british
ipa
and
if
you
dont
mind
some
rough
bitterness
you
just
might
love
this
one
d
drinkability
was
fairly
good
making
for
a
decent
session
not
to
big
not
to
light
thou
not
to
exciting
as
well
pours
a
foggy
dark
copper
hue
with
a
two
finger
rocky
offwhite
head
that
stays
around
for
a
while
stickiness
is
pretty
damn
good
with
a
good
amount
of
floaties
in
this
one
as
well
smell
consists
of
musty
dirt
hops
with
a
touch
of
fresh
flowers
crystal
malts
and
faint
citrus
aromas
tickle
the
nose
as
well
a
good
malty
backbone
up
front
on
the
tongue
followed
by
sweet
citrus
bitter
midway
through
to
the
finish
with
evergreen
and
a
hefty
amount
of
grains
solid
flavors
from
start
to
finish
mouthfeel
with
this
is
much
too
harsh
leaves
the
tongue
puckering
body
is
medium
with
a
steady
carbonation
not
a
bad
brew
overall
but
the
way
it
leaves
the
mouth
takes
away
from
the
overall
experience
dont
think
ill
be
drinking
anything
after
i
finish
this
my
tongue
needs
to
recover
thanks
again
josh
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
my
favorite
from
yards
by
far
much
different
but
equal
to
the
new
philly
brewings
newbold
would
love
to
have
these
in
fridge
and
just
screams
philly
since
it
hides
the
7
abv
i
could
see
this
as
some
kind
of
session
beer
if
you
like
your
ipas
lightly
hopped
and
very
citrusy
then
youll
want
to
try
this
one
for
me
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
one
of
these
this
is
a
pretty
solid
ipa
and
i
would
be
glad
to
have
this
again
pours
a
hazy
orangebrown
color
with
a
rather
small
off
white
head
the
smell
is
sweet
with
tropical
fruit
and
orange
aromas
some
floral
hop
scents
are
noticable
in
the
end
the
taste
starts
off
sweet
then
slowly
turns
bitter
you
can
almost
feel
it
turn
from
sweet
to
bitter
honey
and
tropical
fruit
flavors
kick
things
off
then
are
transformed
into
bitter
citrus
rind
hops
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
with
fizzy
carbonation
and
finishes
bitter
though
it
starts
off
sweet
it
finishes
quite
clean
with
no
slickness
or
stickiness
a
muscular
eipa
seems
a
bit
heavy
on
the
malt
and
bitter
hop
not
as
carbonated
as
other
yard
offering
that
i
have
sampled
a
solid
amber
colored
ipa
with
a
huge
offwhite
head
and
plenty
of
fluffy
lace
the
aroma
is
a
unique
mix
of
malty
pine
hops
and
apple
cider
vinegar
the
taste
is
oddly
sour
with
weak
pine
hops
but
some
hefty
grapefruit
there
is
again
a
sweet
vinegar
dominance
like
a
mash
the
feel
is
very
nice
a
bit
creamy
but
the
sweet
sour
accent
is
a
bit
much
for
me
it
mellows
a
little
as
you
go
it
is
evenly
carbonated
and
pretty
easy
drinking
this
almost
makes
me
think
that
its
a
bad
batch
or
maybe
just
spoiled
a
bit
in
this
bottle
not
sure
if
this
is
the
real
deal
then
its
a
litlle
gnarly
there
seem
to
be
some
flaws
here
and
if
yards
dated
their
bottles
i
would
know
if
it
were
too
old
alas
i
have
to
take
this
beer
at
what
it
is
a
delightful
scent
really
why
cant
other
ipas
smell
this
good
a
bit
weak
in
the
mouthfeel
but
a
great
drinkability
a
session
beer
for
sure
very
nice
beer
would
hold
up
well
to
a
spicy
dinner
or
a
good
steak
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
english
character
for
a
unique
change
of
pace
from
west
coast
ipas
pours
a
very
cloudy
amber
gold
that
is
pretty
dark
on
the
brownish
side
nose
is
a
touch
of
orange
and
very
slight
hops
flavor
is
very
thick
and
robust
subdued
but
still
firm
hops
abound
woody
aftertaste
feel
is
thick
on
the
liquid
from
ingredients
overall
very
drinkable
very
steady
with
its
hearty
attributes
it
delivers
a
good
drinking
experience
i
really
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
would
love
to
try
it
on
cask
conclusion
ive
been
drinking
this
beer
for
years
as
ipas
go
this
is
still
a
solid
choice
that
i
always
keep
in
the
fridge
cheers
smells
of
a
peppery
citrusy
nose
very
appealing
long
lacing
down
the
glass
and
a
pretty
full
head
on
the
pour
i
actually
enjoyed
this
one
more
as
it
warmed
nice
abv
perfect
balance
of
malts
and
hops
very
drinkable
decently
priced
and
actually
warmed
ya
up
as
you
drank
it
peppery
hoppy
dry
finish
very
fresh
and
a
nice
overall
beer
d
not
bad
for
an
ipa
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
ive
had
better
more
drinkable
ipas
but
this
wasnt
terrible
this
will
for
sure
be
a
must
buy
for
me
when
you
see
yards
ipa
try
it
out
and
support
philadelphia
final
thought
the
best
of
the
four
in
the
sampler
case
from
yards
a
very
memorable
ipa
that
will
have
me
buying
a
case
of
this
sweet
nectar
the
next
time
i
am
in
eastern
pa
pours
a
clean
orangeish
amber
color
with
a
white
head
aromas
of
grapefruity
hops
actually
quite
surprising
in
the
taste
grapefruity
hops
and
a
bit
malty
it
also
has
a
dry
hop
aftertaste
a
mellow
ipa
smooth
and
a
good
hop
presence
i
have
not
had
one
in
a
while
and
actually
forgot
how
good
it
was
ive
certainly
had
better
yards
they
have
a
whole
lot
of
hits
this
one
is
just
a
miss
overall
nothing
to
really
write
home
about
here
i
thought
it
was
a
weaker
attempt
at
an
ipa
but
with
all
of
the
recent
100
ibu
10
monster
beer
it
was
a
little
refreshing
to
have
something
that
you
could
have
a
few
in
a
sitting
and
be
none
the
worse
off
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
strongly
carbonated
this
beer
hides
its
8abv
well
and
is
a
nice
shutyourbrainoff
ipa
for
a
warm
day
at
three
bucks
on
saturday
and
two
bucks
on
tuesday
if
youre
a
lush
this
stuff
is
a
steal
extremely
drinkable
ale
here
and
i
do
like
it
only
spot
on
it
would
be
the
big
butter
flavor
you
will
either
love
or
hate
a
fine
sippin
beer
year
round
recommended
both
bottle
conditioned
and
from
a

cheers
fairly
easy
to

especially
for
being

be
a

an

sticky

slight

and
caramel
taste
is
a
balance
between
a
hoppy

mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
good

solid
ipa
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
hazy
orangishamber
color
there
is
a
fairly
substantial
offwhite
head
on
it
the
aroma
is
mainly
citrus
hops
they
are
potent
but
not
over
done
the
taste
is
good
there
is
a
decent
hop
bite
but
not
overdone
nice
malt
backbone
a
hint
of
dryness
to
the
finish
a
decent
enough
ipa
d
id
like
to
try
this
on
tap
to
see
if
the
freshness
adds
more
depth
if
it
doesnt
id
stick
to
some
of
yards
other
offerings
very
odd
flavors
in
this
ipa
yet
i
think
i
like
it
a
belgian
spicey
quality
is
showing
through
far
back
on
the
mid
palate
with
a
bitter
floral
ending
entrance
and
front
mid
are
lackluster
and
really
dont
show
any
depth
whatsoever
one
flowery
beer
too
say
the
least
good
and
bitter
ahhh
who
cannot
enjoy
a
great
ipa
citrusy
aroma
appearance
was
cloudycoppery
color
it
had
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
but
a
diminishing
head
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
but
great
ipa
style
flavor
excellent
hop
flavor
and
nice
finishing
aftertaste
it
has
a
nice
juicy
hop
flavor
but
not
over
the
top
overall
a
great
beer
but
then
again
who
cannot
enjoy
a
good
ipa
d
nice
ipa
slightly
hoppier
than
expected
for
an
english
ipa
not
as
much
spice
as
expected
highly
drinkable
and
easy
to
drink
at
7
packs
a
little
kick
but
doesnt
kick
your
ass
session
this
baby
very
interesting
combination
of
fresh
floral
hops
and
biscuity
malts
the
aromas
are
all
leafy
green
hopiness
with
a
slightly
green
malt
aroma
very
alive
extremely
forceful
bitterness
on
the
mouth
at
first
but
then
a
subdued
sweetness
from
the
malts
very
refreshing
certainly
a
departure
from
the
heavier
american
ipa
but
a
very
nice
change
from
the
regular
and
mundane
drinkability
those
looking
for
an
extreme
hop
bomb
may
want
to
look
elsewhere
this
is
a
well
balanced
brew
with
something
for
everyone
its
very
drinkable
for
a
7
beer
be
careful
though
theyll
catch
up
to
you
i
will
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
cheers
bought
a
case
of
this
after
a
recommendation
from
a
fellow
hophead
and
this
certainly
did
not
disappoint
while
not
quite
as
flavorful
as
victorys
hopdevil
this
brew
does
not
disappoint
with
its
rich
citrusy
taste
oak
aroma
and
bitter
hoppy
aftertaste
this
beer
is
a
great
representation
of
a
british
ipa
and
is
highly
recommended
to
other
hopheads
and
others
who
appreciate
the
style
cheers
overall
i
did
not
expect
such
an
intense
green
hop
presence
from
an
english
ipa
this
is
a
good
beer
though
hazy
and
straw
colored
with
about
a
finger
of
white
head
honey
and
caramel
most
noticable
in
the
aroma
along
with
some
earthy
hops
malty
sweet
flavor
with
a
grassypiney
hop
finish
slightly
woody
and
maybe
a
little
toffee
too
mediumfull
bodied
and
well
carbonated
interesting
beer
seems
mostly
english
in
style
but
also
a
little
american
ipa
twist
thrown
in
there
overall
a
very
tasty
and
highly
quaffable
ipa
amazing
drinkability
considering
the
hefty
abv
much
thanks
to
aprilluvsbeer
bitter
baby
brutally
bitter
for
a
standard
ipa
big
herbal
bitterness
the
cirtrus
is
barely
detectable
on
the
tongue
i
really
look
for
the
malt
to
round
this
beer
out
give
it
some
more
body
but
it
is
underwhelming
next
to
the
hops
mouth
is
almost
thin
feeling
due
to
the
lack
of
balance
a
bit
harsh
for
my
tastes
but
a
decent
enough
ipa
good
for
washing
a
turkey
sandwich
dow
orangered
in
appearance
with
a
nice
head
of
offwhite
foam
smells
hoppy
and
flowery
in
nature
taste
is
very
sweet
and
very
hoppy
citrus
and
flowery
hops
win
out
finish
is
dry
and
bitter
and
wants
of
another
sip
or
three
carbonation
is
good
not
sure
what
all
the
negative
hubbub
is
about
and
mouthfeel
is
rich
without
being
too
syrupy
abv
is
7
according
to
the
case
box
bottle
and
yards
website
english
eh
i
still
like
it
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
traditional
englishstyle
ipa
certainly
one
to
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
hops
this
ones
just
great
by
me
especially
considering
the
price
83
i
dont
believe
this
beer
is
balanced
but
thats
just
me
i
think
it
needs
more
aroma
and
flavor
in
order
to
balance
out
the
bitterness
if
you
like
bitterness
that
isnt
over
the
top
then
this
is
a
good
beer
for
you
quite
good
ill
snag
a
case
of
this
one
the
next
time
i
visit
shangys
for
sure
drinkability
very
unusual
and
interesting
hybrid
just
not
sure
the
combination
works
very
well
poured
a
hazy
amber
with
a
runaway
head
that
was
creamy
white
and
fairly
tight
bubbles
it
took
a
while
for
the
head
to
settle
in
the
glass
so
that
i
could
drink
it
nice
floral
hop
smell
with
some
sweet
malt
as
a
base
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
maybe
a
little
overcarbonated
the
taste
is
a
little
strange
at
first
up
front
is
some
slight
sourness
that
almost
has
a
hint
of
sour
cherry
followed
by
an
alcohol
taste
followed
by
a
long
build
of
hop
bitterness
and
finally
an
almost
liquorice
taste
at
the
end
of
the
hops
a
little
odd
but
it
grows
on
you
the
mouthfeel
has
a
slight
amount
of
syrup
to
it
but
finishes
quite
dry
and
the
beer
is
not
sweet
at
all
given
the
abv
of
8
not
bad
its
a
little
funky
in
its
flavor
and
a
little
high
in
abv
to
drink
much
of
this
overall
fairly
interesting
but
definitely
a
little
different
than
most
beers
of
this
style
the
fruitiness
sometimes
found
in
american
ipas
seems
to
be
more
of
sour
fruit
flavor
here
the
taste
is
initially
sweet
but
then
starts
to
pick
up
some
biting
hop
notes
almost
immediately
it
finishes
with
a
lightly
herbal
lightly
astringent
hoppy
bitterness
that
lingers
on
for
some
time
on
the
tongue
perhaps
the
hop
character
is
a
bit
grassy
as
well
but
only
just
barring
the
initial
sweetness
the
malt
character
is
actually
quite
dry
it
leans
towards
the
toasted
grain
side
of
the
spectrum
with
notes
of
biscuit
malt
and
perhaps
even
some
notes
of
stale
malt
extract
besides
the
bitterness
which
seems
spot
on
for
an
ipa
this
beer
seems
to
be
missing
quite
a
bit
of
hop
character
choose
either
english
hop
character
or
american
but
add
something
here
to
balance
the
bitterness
and
malt
notes
i
would
usually
want
to
put
away
a
few
of
these
of
course
it
would
get
the
better
of
me
but
darn
it
its
good
this
is
my
favorite
beer
that
ive
had
from
yards
although
i
have
enjoyed
them
all
pours
with
a
nice
white
head
on
an
amber
body
fairly
well
carbonated
hoppy
kind
of
orangey
odor
smells
very
fresh
and
clean
delicious
taste
super
hopped
like
the
hops
are
still
in
the
bottle
becaomes
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
after
the
first
couple
of
quaffs
very
enjoyable
and
im
glad
i
have
a
couple
more
in
the
fridge
thanks
dad
a
good
summer
brew
i
think
especially
with
spicy
food
im
not
much
of
a
hophead
but
this
ipa
would
be
well
received
by
that
demographic
d
soooo
drinkable
unbelievable
that
this
is
8
abv
an
outstanding
pa
beer
thanks
to
maltygoodness
for
the
bottle
this
is
nice
and
drinkable
but
i
think
it
lacks
a
strong
enough
malt
background
leading
to
a
bit
of
an
imbalance
and
some
excess
in
bitterness
with
warming
however
the
malts
begin
to
rise
up
and
create
a
better
balance
which
improves
the
drinkability
i
enjoy
the
flavors
essential
cheers
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
almost
to
easy
to
drink
for
an
8
abv
but
im
not
complaining
i
really
like
this
one
i
enjoyed
this
even
though
its
not
the
best
ipa
ive
had
a
good
brew
certainly
worth
trying
once
i
plan
on
looking
into
yards
other
offerings
in
the
near
future
this
pours
a
reddish
amber
with
a
large
foamy
tan
head
the
smell
has
a
real
hop
aroma
this
smells
just
like
grapefruit
juice
cascade
hops
run
rampant
a
nice
aromatic
treat
the
taste
like
the
smell
is
a
hop
overload
the
cascade
hops
make
this
a

marvel
this
is
very
refreshing
and
delicious
the
mf
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
well
balanced
flavorbut
it
could
use
some
more
body
this
is
a
very
good
beerbut
i
could
see
were
the
citrus
flavor
could
get
a
bit
overwhelming
all
in
all
a
decent
ipa
the
previous
version
was
a
little
more
english
in
style
which
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
american
made
ipas
however
this
one
is
very
drinkable
despite
the
claimed
8
abv
so
i
will
go
back
for
it
occasionally
overall
an
amazingly
easy
ipa
to
gulp
down
1
of
the
better
ipas
ive
ever
had
yards
hasnt
disappointed
me
yet
its
bitter
and
its
good
this
is
a
damn
fine
ipa
although
it
might
be
big
for
an
english
delicious
and
very
well
made
hoppy
fruity
bitter
malty
and
alcohol
well
hidden
highly
recommended
strong
bitter
hops
dominate
the
flavor
quite
spicy
the
bitterness
stays
with
you
d
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
but
definitely
interesting
it
might
be
the
sweetest
ipa
ive
ever
had
american
or
english
style
and
i
could
see
it
as
a
great
change
of
pace
ipa
every
now
and
then
thus
its
uniqueness
and
balance
make
it
very
drinkable
thanks

good
easy
beer
to

dont
know
if
i
bought
this
or
got
it
in
a
trade
if
it
was
a
trade
thanks
to
the
one
that
sent
it
very
nicely
drinkable
ipa
had
this
one
by
itself
on
the
porch
in
a
koozie
on
the
boat
and
in
a
plastic
glass
late
evening
on
the
beach
very
warmable
to
the
mouth
and
head
but
crisp
enough
to
be
a
solid
summer
drinker
as
well
great
english
ipa
which
you
dont
see
all
that
many
of
mouthfeel
was
fine
perhaps
a
bit
viscous
but
no
real
faults
drinkability
was
nice
and
i
would
definitly
have
another
too
much
alcohol
for
a
session
beer
but
the
taste
is
right
kind
of
like
a
hopped
up
english
style
ipa
not
really
west
coast
due
to
the
buttery
and
malty
notes
but
definitly
more
hoppy
than
the
standard
english
style
this
had
a
foamy
offwhiteclose
to
tan
in
color
head
it
was
not
as
thick
imo
more
fragile
of
a
head
than
that
on
the
saison
the
beer
itself
was
a
cloudy
orangeamber
color
there
were
plenty
of
hops
on
the
nose
but
you
will
have
to
forgive
me
since
i
still
dont
have
the
knowledge
to
be
able
to
identify
specific
hop
varieties
it
had
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
the
hops
were
big
in
the
mouth
the
beer
had
a
viscous
syrupy
quality
in
the
glass
but
it
did
not
translate
to
the
mouthfeel
the
finish
was
an
interesting
intermingling
of
hops
and
malt
if
only
it
wasnt
8
abv
i
could
rate
drinkability
higher
not
a
lot
of
head
probably
partially
due
to
the
higher
alcohol
content
the
beer
is
slightly
cloudy
as
well
but
thats
not
really
a
knock
since
its
bottle
conditioned
cool
label
with
the
union
jack
under
a
pair
of
crossed
swords
the
aroma
is
not
very
powerful
which
surprises
me
and
its
also
a
little
muddy

how
the
hell
am
i
supposed
to
know
but
it
is
alright
cant
drink
this
stuff
the
flavor
of
this
one
is
a
little
bit
bitter
it
has
some
spicy
hops
and
an
unusual
level
of
sweetness
for
an
ipa
it
was
pretty
crisp
on
the
tongue
which
made
it
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
would
have
to
say
the
flavor
ratings
were
dropped
because
of
the
low
hop
level
it
had
an
interesting
flavor

some

actually
there
was
more
malt
in
the
flavor
than
in
any
ipa
in
recent
memory
it
didnt
hurt
the
flavor
at
all
though
and
actually
made
the
finish
more
subdued
than
in
most
ipas
the
jury
is
out
as
to
whether
that
makes
it
more
complex
or
more
boring
maybe
both
either

this

no

characteristics
and
not

some
of

a
very
weak

its
rather
unfortunate
about
that
as
it
is
a
rather
good
beer
that
follows
it
up
fairly
clear
and
red
wonderful
spicy
and
hoppy
aroma
the
hops
in
the
flavour
are
very
well
balanced
by

sweetness
with
a
good
touch
of
spice
as
well
i
was
shocked
to
see
the
8
abv
when
i
looked
at
the

this
covers
better
than
the
equivalent
strength

about

fabulous
the

i
never

for
the

show
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
a
little
light
on
the
hops
for
my
tastes
seeing
as
this
is
an
ipa
it
leaves
no
lace
and
forms
an
insignifigant
head
the
flavor
is
thin
but
complex
with
a
nice
bitter
aftertaste
hard
to
believe
that
this
is
8
0
abv
its
a
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
potential
but
just
doesnt
seem
to
try
very
hard
if
it
were
more
full
bodied
and
had
a
more
noticeable
hop
presence
it
could
be
great
this
beer
poured
into
the

a
apricotburnt
orange
color
the
head
is
a
whitevanilla
colored
that
seemed
to
start
foamy
and
end
as
a
skim
the
lace
surprised
me
and
lasted
quiet
long
the
aroma
was
fruit
hops
and
some
yeast
and
bread
malt
the
taste
started
off
slightly
sweet
then
the
yeast
flavor
came
into
the
front
then
fruit
dominated
the
rest
with
hops
then
ended
a
little
dry
and
earthy
some
alcohol
was
present
but
very
little
not
the
best
for
this
style
but
i
would
give
it
another
try
at
another
time
pours
a

dark
orange
with

fluffy
off

aroma
was
fruity
hops
with
a
nice
bit
of
yeast

like
malt
smells
too
much
more
sweetness
up
front
than
expected
pears
plum
and
peach
fruitiness
with
less
truly
bitter
hop
flavor
than
expected
earthy
hop
bitterness
on
a
drying
finish
that
doesnt
really
last
long
good
ipa
nicely
drinkable
without
being
over
the
top
on
hop
bitterness
as
the
trend
seems
to
be
for
american
ipas
this
tasted
more
like
an
english
offering
i
would
drink
more
of
this
but
only
recomend
it
if
someone
was
seeking
a
sweeter
less
hopped
ipa
this
beer
started
out
as
a
nice
strong
flavorful
ipa
big
on
the
dried
apricot
aroma
thick
mouthfeel
to
back
up

englishstyle
ibus
alcohol
is
there
but
the
beers
sryupy
sweetness
became
too
much
towards
the
end
still
tasty
though
rather
coarse
head
but
nice
white
and
fluffy
ok
the
first
one
i
had
was
definately
bad
fruit
hops
mango
still
the
same
from
the
first
time
the
main
difference
was
the
taste
this
was
so
much
better
the
second
time
around
it
was
bitter
and
hoppy
like
an
ipa
should
be
but
not
in
the
disgusting
way
it
was
the
first
time
im
glad
i
gave
this
beer
a
second
chance
i
wouldnt
call
this
trinkable
in
a
tradiational
sense
however
it
was
appetizing
in
a
hearty
way
it
had
a
lot
of
bitterness
along
with
toasted
grains
and
a
little
malt
the
dominating
flavor
though
is
certainly
the
hops
the
only
flaw
was
that
i
feel
it
was
not
as
balanced
in
maltiness
as
an
ipa
should
be
nice
orangecopper
color
but
the
fluffy
white
head
dissipated
almost
immediately
the
aroma
is
yeasty
earthy
mineral
fruity
light
hop
some
malt
the
flavor
is
big
fruit
with
a
good
mouthfeel
some
maltiness
and
an
intense
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
long
lasting
fruitymaltbitterness
but
without
being
cloying
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
evident
throughout
but
a
good
beer
nevertheless
not
a
bad
ipa
although
i
had
hoped
for
more
the
aroma
is
good
offering
floral
notes
and
some
piney
sort
of
resin
to
boot
however
the
flavor
was
for
whatever
reason
a
step
or
two
behind
very
crisp
and
light
on
the
palate
still
better
than
alot
of
brews
out
there
the
head
is
nice
and
laces
pretty
well
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
it
prost
quite
a
good
classic
example
of
this
style
if
lots
of
big
yeast
in
your
beer
turns
you
off
do
not
buy
this
product
i
can
just
imagine
this
is
what
they
drank
in
tankerds
on
those
saiboats
to
india
in
the
15th
century
if
you
want
a
good
sturdy
bottle
conditioned
ipa
this
is
a
good
choice

i
have
had

only
drawback
to
this
beer
as
i
can

it
is
the

feel
that
does
not

go
i
must

im
happy

finger

out
of

dissipates
quickly
though
seeing
some
other
reviews
i
have
to
think
its
a
different
experience
out
of
the
keg
nicely
balanced
hoppyfloral
aroma
and
the
taste
follows
suit
with
satisfying
carbonation
as
well
if
you
have
not
had
this
out
of
the
tap
i
would
recommend
it
nice
brew
from
the
big
apple
not
as
hoppy
as
i
expected
but
the
alcohol
well
hidden
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
it
has
a
good
balance
of
hops
fruit
malt
and
carbonation
the
thick
well
designed

glass
works
well
for
this
beer
usually
pale
ales
are
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
beer
if
you
will
however
there
is
something
very
compelling
about
brooklyns
ipas
complex
taste
and
drinkability
its
a
little
watered
down
the
orange
and
green
label
is
both
inviting
and
festive
although
the
initial
taste
can
be
bitter
and
frightening
we
learn
that
the
overall
feeling
is
of
a
quite
essential
alcoholic
necessity
in
conclusion
the
alcohol
percentage
was
a
plus
as
well
as
the
foreign
aspects
of
the
beer
itself

in
the

a

so
of

that
falls

with
some

the
smell
is
lemon
citrus
and
grassy
hops
with
some
biscuit
grain
there
is
a
bit
of
a
metallic
character
in
there
as
well
to
round
it
out
near

the
taste
is
much
like

smell
with
the
lemon
floral
hops
hitting
up

and
carrying
a
moderate
amount
of
bitterness
throughout
the
metallic
flavor

it
isnt

as
the
malt
comes
through
too
but
it
doesnt
quite
do
enough
to
balance
the
hops
crisp
and
clean
at
the
finish
and
lively
in
the
mouth
due
to
a
good
dose
of
carbonation
and
the
spiciness
of
the
hops
overall
this
is
pretty
nice
as
the
english
ipa
is
often
overlooked
and
quite
different
from
the
more
popular
american
style
the
subtle
hops
combine
nicely
with
the
malt
to
provide
a
different
but
satisfying
ipa
experience
ah
wish
i
i
liked
this
overall
a
nicely
hopped
balanced
and
drinkable
take

2
months
past
the
bb
date
aroma
is
floral
and
lightly
resiny
with
nutty
caramel
malt
and
perfumey
herbal
hops
adding
complexity
flavor
reveals
a
strong
caramel
malt
backbone
fairly
sweet
which
is
contrasted
by
moderately
bitter
hops
at
the
finish
herbal
hops
provide
a
bridge
mid
palate
and
resurface
in
the
aftertaste
the
herbal
hop
character
isnt
my
favorite
and
bitterness
is
more
than
id
prefer
in
the
finish
malt
is
a
bit
overly
sweet
overall
its
a
decent
beer
would
prefer
something
with
a
little
more
complexity
but
i
could
see
me
reaching
for
one
of
these
on
a
warm
summer
day
overall
it
is
tasty
looking
for
a
freshness
date
after
half
the
bottle
and
i
cant
find
one
could
the
hops
have
died
down
that
much
well
wheres
the
date
could
this
bottle
be
that
old
well
again
wheres
the
god
damn
date
i
have
no
idea
but
the
hops
are
just
not
there
at
all
this
is
more
malt
than
anything
to
me
and
i
have
a
feeling
i
just
have
an
old
old
bottle
but
nonetheless
this
was
a
pretty
disappointing
offering
from
brooklyn
for
me
ill
only
be
seeking
this
out
again
to
find
out
if
this
is
a
truly
disappointing
beer
or
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
bummed
for
sure
at
the
moment
though
i
think
an
ipa
is
supposed
to
be
hoppy
this
aint
o
easy
to
drink
fairly
mild
for
an
ipa
during
the
summer
months
i
generally
have
a
bottle
or
two
chilled
in
the
fridge
body
is
ok
too
didnt
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
too
much
because
of
the
acidity
that
comes
in
corners
of
the
lips
the
taste
is
like
any
really
good
ipa
this
beers
only
drawback
is
the
excessive
abv
becuase
there
are
hints
of
booze
in
the
aftertaste
nice
orange
color
with
a
very
thin
head
that
goes
away
almost
immediately
i
drank
it
from
a
teku
glass
which
always
accentuates
the
smell
nice
floral
and
butterscotch
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
finishes
quick
unlike
most
americans
ipas
dont
tend
to
be
my
favorite
although
i
really
liked
this
one
as
it
focused
on
balance
rather
than
the
classic
mo
hops
mo
better
philosophy
that
many
american
brewers
shoot
for
crystal
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
off
white
head
that
persists
forever
aromas
of
bread
caramel
and
earthy
hops
english
inspired
yeasty
esters
as
well
as
just
a
touch
of
butterscotch
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
sweet
bready
caramel
malt
with
enough
earthy
hop
to
balance
light
fruity
notes
and
a
touch
of
butterscotch
round
this
out
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
decent
english
inspired
beer
with
a
bit
more
hop
bite
than
its
true
english
counterparts
i
prefer
an
americanized
version
honestly
very
carbonated
very
citrusfloral
sweet
and
tart
with
a
thin
mouthfeel
and
light
on
the
hops
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
but
not
a
lot
going
on
here
i
prefer
ipas
that
pack
more
of
a
hop
punch
andor
have
a
more
complex
taste
profile
i
love
brooklyn
brewery
but
this
beer
is
definitely
not
a
classic
like
brooklyn
lager
or
particularly
flavorfulinteresting
like
local
1
and
2
or
brooklyn
blast
o
nothing
special
here
i
tend
to
expect
an
ipa
to
be
a
little
more
on
the
bold
side
and
this
one
was
quite
mild
at
its
price
point
there
are
far
better
ipa
options
opretty
good
ipa
would
buy
again
but
not
before
i
tried
other
beers
oid
drink
this
if
given
to
me
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
its
fine
for
an
ipa
you
might
find
in
a
sampler
pack
or
a
beer
handed
to
you
at
a
campfire
however
doesnt
compete
with
the
big
guys
an
enjoyable
eipa
o
not
too
impressive
but
a
good
beer
overall
the
malt
base
is
nice
but
i
would
have
loved
a
bigger
hops
presence
this
just
isnt
a
must
have
beer
in
any
way
and
its
kind
of
a
bummer
i
always
end
up
having
it
hoping
for
it
to
be
more
than
it
is
but
it
never
is
and
i
always
wish
i
picked
up
a
different
ipa
or
eipa
or
even
pale
ale
its
even
a
bit
strong
in
terms
of
abv
to
be
a
session
ipa
o
one
of
my
favorites
told
my
shop
to
get
more
when
they
ran
out
took
them
about
4
months
to
get
more
and
now
im
happy
again
going
to
have
to
find
clone
recipes
following
on
the
heels
of
this

amber
lager
poured
from
a

at

left
on

smells
like
an
admixture

some

and
an
interesting

brooklyn
can
sure
generate
some
unique
hop
flavors
this
one
is
bitter
but
the
hop
flavors
and
aromas
get
center
stage
what
about
the
malts
you
ask
quite
nice
actually
nutty
brown
bread
and
some
classic
old
english
tastes
according
to
the
label
the
malts
and
hops
are
english
but
i
taste
and
smell
us
hops
as
well
fo
sho
semibuttery
mouthfeel
with
some
diacetyl
apparent
more
carbonation
than
many
english
ales
but
the
bubbles
are
not
a
nuisance
element
here
interesting
take
on
the
style
a
sneaky
or
not
so
sneaky
amalgam
of
old
and
new
world
elements

creamy

head
from
an

that
slowly

of

and
piney
hops
with
a
slight
sweetness
and
bread
taste
follows
suit
except
the
hops
are
much
more
in
flavor
and
aroma
than
bitterness
which
i
really
enjoying
a
nice
easy
drinking
hoppy
beer
that
is
more
about
hop
characters
than
bitterness
with
mild
malt
starting
and
finishing
with
the
mild
bitter
of
the
hops
slightly
creamy
in
the
mouth
really
enjoyed
this
very
nice
surprise
the
best
ipa
that
im
aware
of
is
sierra
nevadas
torpedo
i
love
that
beer
its
a
mouthfeel
taste
thing
dad
never
said
anything
about
that
and
im
thinking
that
i
would
rate
the
torpedo
higher
but
on
second
thought
id
have
to
do
a
direct
comparison
test
to
be
fair
and
honest
this
brooklyn
beer
definitely
has
the
mouthfeel
taste
thing
going
which
means
that
maybe
i
shouldnt
even
be
rating
it
at
this
time
can
you
give
me
a
break
im
a
newbie
here
just
trying
to
get
serious
about
the
beer
i
drink
even
if
thats
maybe
a
joke
remarks
got
this
and
a
few
other
brands
to
see
if
i
want
to
homebrew
an
english
ipa
unfortunately
i
found
out
this
beer
has
a
blend
of
us
hops
overall
more
fruity
and
less
bitter
than
many
ipas
hits
a
pleasant
balance
overall
an
nice
ipa
overall
a
good
mainly
bitter
earthy
bite
that
is
a
bit
on
the
drier
side
overall
o
this
would
probably
be
my
favorite
ipa
by
that
i
mean
the
only
ipa
i
would
willingly
go
out
and
buy
its
very
well
balanced
the
hoppy
flavors
expected
from
an
ipa
are
mellow
and
do
not
kill
you
so
im
really
liking
this
brew
i
would
recommend
this
semidry
as
the
malts
give
balance
the
feel
with
a
bit
of
smoothness
and
raise
the
body
to
medium
this
beer
focuses
on
crispness
and

at

perhaps
a

this

a

pretty

almost
a

finish
refreshing
to
have
an
ipa
that
is
kind
of
scaled
back
from
what
can
sometimes
be
an
aggressive
hop
taste
the
hops
are
far
more
evident
in
the
flavor
as
their
floral
bitterness
kicks
in
and
supersedes
the

there
is

from

away
from

with

a
disc
of

smell
is
crisp
and
clean
some
herbal
and
skunkier
hops
with
some
clean

behind
it
taste
follows
just
about
the
same
crackery
malt
with
herbal
grassy
hops
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
but
not
unbalanced
its
funny
an
english
ipa
on
the
lower
end
of

is
almost
the
same
as
an
apa
on
the

end
of

this
beer
is
great
for
the
style
crisp

refreshing
even
a
bit
dry
notes
unusually
high
toffee
note
and
overly
sweet

tasty
but
leaning
towards
a

the
beer
was
a
nice
golden
color
and
had
a
decent
head
when
poured
from
the
can
it
was
okay
but
better
poured
it
had
a
nice
citrus
smell
and
was
decently
hopped
when
i
had
some
crackers
and
irish
white
cheese
it
complemented
it
well
i
would
drink
it
again
if
youre
not
ready
for
the
bitter
flavor
to
stay
on
the
aftertaste
then
this
is
not
for
you

with
very

and
bitter
bitey
aftertaste
lingers
a
touch
too
long
edit
its
listed
as
an
english
ipa
but
tastes
extremely
american
to
me
glad
i
purchased
a
6
pack
will
buy
more
in
the
future
overall
this
does
remind
me
of
some
english
ipas
as
far
as
the
malts
notes
go
theres
a
little
bit
of
fighting
for
taste
between
the
hop
and
malts
but
a
nice
and
distinct
ipa
that
i
would
try
again
for
sure
o
this
is
a
solid
english
ipa
generally
not
my
favorites
but
this
one
has
a
nice
touch
o
a
great
beer
but
not
so
extreme
as
some
would
expecting
still
a
great
experience
that
deserve
one
shot
ive
had
this
beer
possibly
hundreds
of
times
in
the
last
15
years
and
never
thought
mich
of
it
im
brewing
an
english
ipa
this
week
and
have
been
researching
i
had
low
expectations
based
on
other
reviews
and
my
own
history
but
i
think
this
has
changed
my
mind
its
a
great
english
ipa
not
west
coast
and
if
that
is
what
you
look
for
you
will
be
disappointed
warm
and
hoppy
at
the
same
time
some
of
the
fruity
english
style
of
hopping
but
more
bitter
than
youd
expect
a
hint
of
orange
flavor
with
some
woodiness
maybe
a
touch
of
dried
apricot
and
a
quinine
bitterness
drinkable
enough
if
you
like
the
english
bitter
style
though
not
as
aromatic
as
i
would
hope
for
the
bitter
aftertaste
becomes
more
pronounced
after
some
sipping
from
the
12
oz
bottle
in
a
seasonal
12
pack
from
the
supermarket
price
point
83
single
12
oz
can
o
not
a
very
good
ipa
lacking
the
aroma
and
hop
taste
stickiness
could
be
due
to
that
as
well
bottle
bought
in
sweden
maybe
too
old
cant
find
the
filling
date
while
i
do
consider
it
somewhere
between
the
two
british
side
being
the
malts
and
majority
of
hops
and
the
american
side
being
the
centennial
dryhopping
and
higher
abv
i
hope
everyone
is
judging
this
beer
more
on
the
side
of
british
ipa
than
american
ipa
overall
a
very
nice
representative
of
the
style
ill
choose
this
over
many
others
if
its
available
overall
decent
but
not
amazing
somewhat
onedimensional
sorry
for
cliche
but
its
true
this
brew
was
on
my
bucket
list
so
i
gave
it
a
shot
would
recommend
but
not
rave
about
o
overall
this
east
ipa
gets
a
lower
mark
than
what
it
stated
with
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
most
important
to
me
and
those
two
traits
were
lacking
against
my
palate
for
someone
that
enjoys
hoppines
without
the
interference
of
additional
flavors
would
enjoy
this
ipa
overall
im
extremely
surprised
i
generally
dont
like
brooklyn
brewerys
beers
but
this
one
stands
out
for
me
along
with
the
double
chocolate
stout
i
would
recommend
getting
it
fresh
because
the
hops
disappear
super
fast
this
is
a
wholly
different
beer
when
fresh
and
not
when
it
isnt
it
gets
mild
and
boring
with
flat
malt
flavors
food
match
for
a
brew
as
fresh
and
bitter
as
this
a
salad
would
go
great
perhaps
greek
salad
or
a
grilled
chicken
and
rocket
salad
would
work
best
it
is
a
fairly
balanced
beer
so
quite
a
lot
of
cuisines
would
work
actually
a
pad
thai
would
kill
it
with
this
brew
nice
ipa
with
good
balance
and
pleasant
flavours
i
really
go
back
and
forth
with
this
one
scratch
my
head
when
without
food
totally
enjoy
with
spicy
food
so
there
you
have
it
o
this
is
good
im
glad
i
finally
picked
one
up
not
awful
just
needs
some
improvement
in
the
dry
hopping
procedures
overall
this
beer
is
refreshing
but
its
sweetness
might
be
disturbing
to
some
drinkers
however
i
find
it
a
great
change
of
pace
and
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that

piney
spiciness
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
very
nice
hop
flavor
balance
and
malt
balance
and
zero
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
fairly
creamy
sticky
and
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
ipa
very
nice
hop
and
malt
balance
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
enjoyed
this
and
was
excited
to
be
able
to
get
a
growler
this
should
be
the
first
ipa
everyone
drinks
it
is
very
drinkable
hoppy
but
not
mouth
numbing
and
very
bright
and
flavorful
this
is
just
a
great
version
of
an
english
ipa
with
an
american
brightness
reliable
mild
ipa
american
brewery
making
a
transition
english
ipa
that
is
travelling
the
seas
to
america
not
india
this
is
a
nice
ipa
it
has
a
nice
solid
malt
character
and
a
well
balanced
hop
presence
the
drinkability
was
on
point
as
well
its
not
an
ipa
i
would
buy
regularly
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
pass
it
up
a
good
ipa
fruity
hops
and
a
nice
medium
body
sessionable
and
tasty
the
pours
has
a
little
redish
hue
to
it
with
lots
of
bubbles
rising
up
and
a
short
white
head
the
nose
has
got
some
great
fruit
to
it
pineapple
or
something
else
tropical
bitter
too
over
a
nice
caramely
malt
profile
the
taste
is
bitter
all
the
way
through
with
a
lot
less
fruit
being
present
the
malt
is
delicate
but
still
sturdy
enough
to
counterbalance
the
hops
clean
finish
real
bitter
this
beer
tastes
very
fresh
and
is
one
of
my
favorite
brooklyn
year
round
beers
i
could
drink
this
all
day
overall
similar
to
the
brooklyn
lager
but
if
anything
it
comes
across
a
bit
awkward
theres
a
definite
alcohol
fug
not
entirely
sure
about
the
english
american
ipahybrid
hmmmm
soso
i
remember
it
more
fondly
but
perhaps
my
palate
has
evolved
or
perhaps
this
is
old
it
fits
the
description
of
an
ipa
plenty
of
aromatic
bitter
hops
and
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
yet
it
lacks
something
the
hops
are
dry
and
overpowering
the
malt
just
doesnt
balance
them
out
there
is
a
harshness
that
reminds
me
of
stewed
leaves
perhaps
something
brought
out
in
the
boil
a
few
offnotes
also
lurk
including
an
unwelcome
whiff
of
solvent
a
decent
but
flawed
effort
if
i
had
to
make
one
suggestion
id
say
beef
up
the
malt
not
world
class
but
worth
trying
rjt
drinks
smooth
with
a
medium
weight
on
the
palette
clean
with
minamal
aftertaste
and
really
isnt
all
that
bitter
this
is
quite
an
easy
drinking
brew
and
no
doubt
sure
to
please
overall
a
good
ipa
definitely
less
hoppy
and
bitter
than
american
versions
medium
body
medium
carbonation
just
a
touch
of
creamy
smoothness
good
drinkability
this
is
an
underrated
beer
in
my
estimation
and
im
not
generally
a
fan
of
english
style
ipas
simply
put
this
is
balanced
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
o
overall
this
is
a
decent
english
ipa
a
sessionable
ipa
if
you
will
which
many
on
the
other
side
of
the
pond
would
clearly
argue
with
in
fact
now
that
i
am
looking
at
the
abv
i
was
stunned
to
see
it
is
listed
at
6
9
abv
this
is
clearly
not
a
sessionable
ipa
at
this
abv
but
i
never
would
have
known
it
was
that
high
until
i
bothered
to
check
simply
put
this
is
not
overpoweringly
bitter
nor
overpoweringly
sweet
which
clearly
mislead
me
on
this
definitely
a
good
malt
forward
english
ipa
i
enjoyed
it
o
even
for
a
bottle
thats
almost
past
its
prime
this
was
a
good
drink
its
not
going
to
rip
you
out
of
your
chair
and
put
you
in
an
old
english
pub
with
every
sip
like
some
american
beers
of
this
style
but
you
wont
be
disappointed
if
you
grab
a
pint
i
certainly
wasnt
o
a
good
english
ipa
that
packs
solid
hop
flavors
and
aromas
definitely
true
to
english
style
rather
than
hopping
the
crap
out
of
it
solid
choice
for
an
american
brewed
english
ipa
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
and
golden
with
a
threefinger
length
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
theres
a
moderate
amount
of
visible
tiny
bubbles
in
the
beer
grassy
piney
and
citrus
hop
aromas
come
through
in
the
nose
theres
some
maltiness
in
the
smell
as
well
the
taste
follows
the
nose
through
the
citrus
hop
flavors
come
through
really
well
theres
a
nice
malt
backbone
here
that
is
mildly
sweet
and
bready
i
get
those
pine
and
grassy
notes
as
well
theres
some
nice
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
the
alcohol
isnt
detectable
in
the
favor
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
dry
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
a
solid
example
of
the
style
i
didnt
mind
this
beer
not
typically
a
fan
of
brookyln
average
beer
but
but
decent
for
an
english
ipa
and
one
of
the
better
brooklyn
beers
ive
had
overall
this
is
a
lot
better
than
most
ipas
ive
had
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
and
has
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
very
crisp
dry
and
refreshing
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
nothing
that
is
above
average
and
there
are
many
ipas
better
than
this
the
rest
not
too
crazy
about
the
aroma
but
a
nice
subdued
ipa
was
hiding
under
that
somewhat
funky
smell
o
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
really
special
pretty
much
what
i
think
about
most
brooklyn
offerings
d
an
interesting
english
ipa
from
brooklyn
quaffable
enough
unique
enough
amongst
its
style
brethren
but
nothing
too
note
worthy
either
i
would
gladly
throw
a
couple
back
in
a
pinch
but
im
not
too
sure
this
is
something
that
i
would
buy
with
regularity
either
about
what
i
expected
orangeamber
in
color
this
beer
is
topped
with
a
white
head
it
has
a
brilliant
clarity
and
a
grassy
hoppy
aroma
the
hop
smell
is
not
as
intense
as
other
ipas
english
style
with
herbal
and
earthy
overtones
the
taste
is
dryer
than
i
anticipated
it
has
a
slight
malt
flavor
up
front
but
dries
out
with
a
hop
flavor
and
moderate
spice
note
medium
in
body
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
brew

o
this
beer
is
both
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
in
a
row
while
its
not
my
favorite
english
ipa
i
would
never
turn
one
of
these
down
the
pleasant
balance
of
sweet
malts
and
floral
piny
hops
coupled
with
above
average
mouthfeel
makes
a
can
of
this
well
suited
for
a
hot
summer
night
o
i
would
say
i
would
have
this
again
i
liked
it
enough
to
have
it
again
as
woodychandler
said
american
ipas
tend
to
make
it
hard
to
fully
appreciate
the
english
counterparts
from
which
they
were
inspired
but
this
is
a
pleasant
one
to
enjoy
overall
i
have
a
hard
time
placing
this
beer
on
my
wanttodrinkitmore
scale
it
is
stylistically
good
and
has
an
interesting
flavor
but
its
just
got
too
much
perfume
to
it
it
tastes
and
smells
like
canadian
floral
gum
candy
simply
not
my
favorite
the
crack
glug
produced
twoplus
fingers
of
dense
tawny
head
with
very
good
retention
nose
had
an
earthy
hop
quality
to
it
not
minty
or
pine
but
more
like
freshly
picked
vegetal
matter
as
the
head
slowly
fell
dense
sticky
lacing
remained
in
its
wake
color
was
an
ohsoslightly
hazy
deep
orangishamber
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
combination
of
grassy
hops
and
honeylike
sweetness
on
the
tongue
i
was
reminded
of
tea
at
one
point
finish
was
equally
mellow
and
certainly
not
indicative
of
the
6
9
abv
noted
on
the
can
man
i
felt
like
i
could
easily
quaff
several
of
these
without
any
problem
i
remember
the
first
time
i
tried
an
english
ipa
after
many
months
of
steady
american
ipas
and
feeling
disappointed
not
so
in
this
case
put
some
in
a
cooler
and
head
to
the
beach
this
was
decent
it
certainly
has
a
good
bit
of
fresh
juicy
tropical
flavor
to
it
for
those
that
like
that
in
their
ipas
i
personally
would
have
like
a
touch
more
aggressiveness
here
but
this
is
definitely
pretty
accessible
for
the
style
and
a
good
one
to
introduce
to
those
not
overly
familiar
with
the
style
overall
an
extremely
solid
english
ipa
and
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
sampled
while
i
prefer
the
more
citric
american
ipas
something
like
this
is
a
nice
change
and
one
i
would
certainly
pick
up
again

a

overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
may
get
it
again
just
to
see
if
the

are

in
a
1
or
2

pours
a
clear

this
is
a
very
clear
beer
on

i
notice
grass
pine
and
malt
there
is
also
a
little
spice
not
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
beyond
bitterness
there
is
a
good
amount
of
malt
character
reminds
me
of
a
very
light
version
of
their
monster
ale
barleywine
i
would
say
that
this
beer
is
of
medium
light
body
there
is
not
enough
hop
flavor
to
justify
the
bitterness
in
that
way
it
is
not
very
well
balanced
this
may
be
to
style
if
all
we
had
were
english
pale
ales
i
may
not
have
become
a
fan
ipas
i
have
had
this
beer
a
few
other
times
and
felt
disappointed
but
since
i
have
become
more
knowledgeable
of
beer
i
figured
what
i
had
had
may
have
been
too
old
or
too
cold
to
fully
enjoy
that
was
not
it
if
you
like
bitter
beer
and
dont
like
citrusy
american
hops
this
may
be
the
beer
for
you
overall
this
is
a
decent
offering
but
by
far
not
brooklyns
best
or
the
best
of
the
style
by
far
better
than
some
but
equally
forgetable
theres
just
so
many
beers
i
would
rather
have
than
this
one
o
a
solid
very
dry
ipa
quite
satisfying
a
most
satisfying
beer
o
overall
a
very
easy
to
drink
very
refreshing
and
very
enjoyable
beer
i
could
easily
have
a
couple
of
these
in
a
session
i
enjoy
the
aroma
the
most
the
floral
hops
notes
were
very
complex
and
interesting
definitely
a
good
everyday
beer
overall
its
important
to
know
the
roots
of
things
and
perhaps
brooklyns
east
india
pale
ale
is
a
good
example
of
where
all
those
big
brash
americanstyle
ipas
originally
came
from
it
does
a
great
job
highlighting
the
east
kent
golding
hop
a
hop
that
has
been
a
staple
in
english
brewing
for
hundreds
of
years
certainly
worth
your
while
so
when
will
they
put
some
of
the
brooklyn
blast

the

ends
with
a
hard

well
hopped

more
yeast

than
what
is
typical
of
us
brewers
very
good
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
clear
muddled
copperorange
coloring
with
a
chunky
uneven
sparse
filmy
coating
on
the
surface
and
a
slight
cling
along
the
glass
aromas
of
blended
toffee
and
caramel
sweetness
combine
with
a
slightly
floral
and
citrus
hops
presence
flavors
are
hop
forward
with
a
peppery
and
bitter
character
initially
balanced
with
a
roasted
caramel
backbone
the
sweetness
becomes
tangy
across
the
tongue
with
a
more
resiny
and
rich
hops
presence
at
the
end
of
the
palate
leading
to
a
bitter
and
slightly
dry
aftertaste
and
a
rich
slick
and
somewhat
dry
finish
the
beers
flavors
are
simple
yet
tasty
and
the
body
of
the
beer
is
dynamic
throughout
the
tasting
o
like
many
brooklyn
beers
ive
had
it
is
hard
to
find
any
glaring
faults
looks
good
and
tastes
good
smooth
enough
for
a
guy
like
me
who
typically
doesnt
drink
ipas
of
any
type
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
softness
to
everything
the
nose
was
clean
around
the
edges
and
all
the
components
were
blended
nicely
but
everything
had
a
light
and
airy
quality
to
it
this
however
never
took
away
from
the
flavor
which
was
robust
and
present
throughout
everything
balanced
nicely
with
the
robust
malts
and
the
bright
grassy
hops
giving
a
unique
product
in
the
end
with
such
a
big
malt
profile
we
actually
felt
this
to
be
rather
similar
to
a
belgian
ipa
regardless
of
style
this
beer
was
tasty
and
perfectly
complemented
our
jalapeno
quesadillas
a
great
session
brew
from
brooklyn
im
a
fan
of
their
english
twists

o
its

very
balanced
and
leaves
you
waiting
for
another

not
my

but
this
is
something
very
interesting
to
me
a

reasonably

but
not

ok
on

well
produced
english
ipa
overall
a
bold
ipa
unique
in
itself
but
not
straying
too
far
from
the
traditional
ipa
character
worthy
of
a
few
pints
o
pretty
good
ipa
looks
really
nice
and
the
nose
is
good
dry
mouthfeel
o
like
it
sessionable
for
a
6
9
abv
brew
saying
all
that
it
was
still
a
pleasant
enough
experience
o
not
bad
but
not
what
i
really
look
for
in
a
ipa
a
bit
too
fruity
for
me
and
not
enough
citrus
or
earthy
flavors
kind
of
average
but
i
nice
changeofpace
ipa
overall
an
average
ipa
interesting
that
a
new
york
brewery
chose
to
use
all
english
ingredients
for
this
one
just
wish
they
used
more
of
them
so
the
hops
could
assert
themselves
or
else
use
a
more
alpha
variety
hop
to
add
more
hop
bitterness
to
make
it
more
reflective
of
an
ipa
good
british
style
ipa
worthy
of
grabbing
a
bottle
to
try
out
attenuation
and
overall
quality
of
brewing
are
apparent
while
your
tastes
may
lean
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
assertive
hops
in
an
english
brew
or
the
english
hopping
in
an
american
ipa
o
i
was
quite
impressed
by
this
brew
its
very
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
a
solid
reflection
o
an
englishstyle
brew
i
remember
the
tap
version
having
much
more
of
a
hop
character
which
would
place
it
on
our
side
of
the
pond
the
bottles
version
is
sosmething
different
but
still
good
could
be
a
lot
better
lacks
the
punch
in
the
flavour
and
bitterness
to
make
it
a
real
winner
ok
to
drink
but
does
leave
you
feeling
a
little
wanting
especially
when
you
consider
that
this
wasnt
a
grey
import
and
had
10
months
left
on
the
best
before
date
overall
its
a
nice
departure
from
many
of
the
more
hoppy
beers
i
usually
drink
not
a
favorite
but
solid
overall
this
is
just
a
very
average
ipa
in
my
opinion
not
too
much
going
on
nothing
other
than
the
nose
to
complain
about
but
definitely
nothing
that
is
wowing
me
pours
a
semicloudy
amber
color
with
a
slight
white
head
scents
are
bready
citrus
malts
and
some
bitter
hops
taste
is
mild
but
has
a
decent
texture
taste
is
bready
with
some
slight
citrus
and
finishes
with
a
semidry
hoppy
bitterness
very
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
one
of
the
more
mellow
ipas
that
has
a
good
taste
o
an
easy
drinking
and
sweet
ipa
much
less
bitter
than
most
thank
you
brooklyn
brewery
cant
wait
to
try
this
backtoback
with
the
west
india
pale
ale
whats
that
isnt
one
but
it
pours
a
clear
lightlyrsusy
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
pine
resin
caramel
and
light
greens
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
nice
cilantro
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
overall
a
decently
solid
ipa
nothing
exciting
but
something
i
could
see
drinking
again
o
very
good
ipa
delicious
but
not
an
all
the
time
drink
there
are
better
choices
for
cheaper
ipas
look
for
them
overall
the
subdued
hop
profile
and
sweet
caramel
flavor
makes
this
an
easy
to
drink
ipa
to
those
who
arent
used
to
the
ipa
flavor
simple
in
flavor
but
still
pretty
good
dnot
very
drinkable
or
approachable
i
find
the
hop
notes
to
really
make
this
a
hard
to
drink
beer
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
did
not
enjoy
my
first
beer
of
the
sixer
now
im
down
to
my
last
and
im
really
appreciating
this
beer
be
warned
that
despite
the
beers
style
the
abv
is
still
decidedly
american
after
reading
others
reviews
i
can
definitely
also
relate
to
the
vanilla
elements
picked
up
recommended
as
a
curveball
from
us
ipas
which
still
holds
its
own
bottle
from
half
time
poured
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
lasting
white
head
aroma
of
biscuit
floral
notes
and
light
earthiness
mouthfeel
was
light
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
flavors
of
biscuit
floral
notes
and
light
earthiness
with
a
smooth
dry
moderatly
bvitter
finish
overall
like
i
said
above
more
of
an
everyday
ipa
than
your
once
in
a
while
beer
easy
to
drink
and
easier
to
like
hope
you
enjoy
cheers
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
it
is
pretty
refreshing
and
has
a
nice
depth
and
almost
what
i
would
call
a
thickness
to
it
tastes
real
good
smell
is
clean
overall
pretty
nice
would
get
it
again
and
again
carbonation
could
be
higher
pours
in
the
middle
of
light
and
dark
caramel
color
floaties
in
the
beer
smells
like
liquid
caramel
gave
it
a
3
5
due
to
lack
of
hops
on
the
nose
however
it
smells
very
good
taste
is
loads
of
caramel
light
floral
hops
and
finishes
like
the
back
end
of
a
cherry
blowpop
theres
another
taste
that
i
cant
place
that
reminds
me
of
something
that
ive
eaten
in
my
childhood
very
interesting
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
light
imo
good
body
but
not
stellar
overall
this
is
tasty
very
different
but
tasty
a
decent
english
ipa
the
flavours
are
right
but
it
doesnt
excite
this
is
a
solid
beer
o
a
very
different
ipa
i
believe
this
is
my
first
english
ipa
so
not
much
to
compare
to
definitely
willing
to
try
more
of
the
style
o
i
enjoyed
this
ipa
it
was
nice
and
hoppy
and
easily
drinkable
overall
it
was
tasty
pretty
nice
example
of
an
english
styled
ipa
definitely
didnt
have
the
overthetop
west
coast
approach
but
the
flavor
and
bitterness
still
let
you
know
it
was
an
ipa
a
nice
drink
overall
would
do
well
with
a
variety
of
foods
o
sweeter
than
i
anticipated
but
still
well
rounded
with
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
oi
would
not
revisit
its
lacking
in
alot
of
departments
in
my
mind
cheers
not
a
bad
ipa
easy
to
drink
the
aroma
and
taste
are
good
just
lacking
a
little
bit
but
something
to
try
if
you
got
a
chance
i
think
this
was
a
bit
to
hot
and
boozey
for
my
liking
overall
a
decent
ipa
paired
very
well
with
spicy
indian
food
in
conclusion
no
i
wouldnt
call
it
youre
regular
ipa
eipas
is
a
spicer
version
of
youre
average
ipa
its
a
good
ipa
its
an
agreeable
its
session
ipa
but
its
not
your
usual
ipa
overall
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
its
a
nice
ipa
for
the
occasions
where
you
want
all
the
flavour
without
all
the
alcohol
and
intensity
of
a
dipa
overall
nice
british
version
of
the
ipa
on
the
malty
side
with
the
nice
mild
and
slightly
bitter
tastes
that
comes
with
the
british
malts
and
hops
super
easy
drinking
decent
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
nothing
overpowering
on
either
side
just
barely
on
the
sweet
side
a
well
crafted
brew
very
drinkable
glad
i
bought
it
taste
is
well
balanced
a
bit
of
iron
but
not
so
much
that
it
kills
it
the
hops
provide
quite
a
bitter
bite
without
much
of
a
fruity
or
foral
flavor
at
all
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
in
the
bottle
and
i
think
it
would
be
awesome
on
cask
o
exceptionally
enjoyable
and
notably
sweet
and
fruity
version
of
an
english
ipa

that
doesnt
go

on

while
still
packing
quite
a
lot
of
flavor
notes
from
149
overall
this
is
kind
of
like
a
slow
moving
ipa
fairly
enjoyable
and
the
high
abv
seems
to
be
hidden
pretty
well
too
poured
into
glass
looks
nice
goldencloudy
the
smell
is
very
hoppy
with
caramel
and
piney
citrus
the
flavor
is
a
really
good
ipaish
citrus
with
pine
accents
yet
this
beer
has
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
that
combines
for
a
total
package
this
is
full
flavored
beverage
not
for
the
week
of
heart
i
feel
like
if
you
are
a
beer
lover
than
this
will
be
right
up
your
alley
othe
nose
was
great
but
the
taste
did
not
stack
up
just
a
little
more
in
the
way
of
either
citrus
or
earth
tones
and
it
would
have
been
a
b
a
beer
color
me
impressed
really
nice
ipa
despite
being
almost
5
months
old
will
certainly
seek
out
a
fresh
sample
in
the
future

on

a

could
be

imo
i
wouldnt
turn

theres
certainly
some
better
ipas
out
there
d
i
enjoy
this

though
its

this
could
be
a
good

if
not
a

at

o
a
very
nice
ipa
would
like
to
have
more
nose
to
it
but
the
flavor
is
nice
and
overall
a
decent
beer
best
by
nov
2011
thought
i
would
give
it
a
shot
pours
out
a
pale
copper
color
with
a
somewhat
creamy
looking
head
some
faint
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
like
earthy
spicey
hops
and
some
biscuity
malts
with
some
vinous
aromas
in
there
as
well
taste
has
a
nice
citric
twang
with
some
more
sweet
pale
malts
to
balance
it
some
acetaldehyde
and
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
to
me
it
seems
more
of
an
english
style
ipa
than
anything
no
piney
hops
that
i
can
detect
and
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
english
style
bitter
than
an
american
ipa
there
is
more
character
from
the
pale
malts
than
your
typical
ipa
and
has
that
faint
earthy
peaty
flavor
perhaps
from
the
combination
of
the
european
hops
and
malts
it
is
decent
beer
but
personally
i
think
brooklyns
beers
are
decidedly
english
which
makes
sense
given
the
history
of
america
moutfeel
is
pretty
smooth
nothing
to
remark
about
overall
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
pale
ale
more
english
style
in
that
the
hops
play
a
nice
bittering
effect
rather
than
a
highly
aromatic
and
flavoring
one
i
like
an
ipa
that
i
can
get
more
from
the
hops
than
just
the
bittering
effect
anyway
a
good
beer
probably
more
authentic
to
the
original
style
than
most
just
i
have
grown
to
love
the
big
dank
resinous
smack
you
in
the
face
with
hops
americanstyle
ipa
east
india
pale
ale
is
a
good
representation
of
the
english
ipa
style
so
if
you
like
the
style
giveitago
o
good
not
great
but
an
enjoyable
sessionable
beer
nonetheless
overall
brewers
have
a
deft
hand
on
bring
this
beer
forward
with
lots
of
flavor
balance
and
keeping
it
very
drinkable
englishstyle
ales
rarely
get
hyped
though
this
one
is
a
must
notes
a
great
interpretation
of
the
style
immensely
enjoyable
and
a
standout
beer
this
is
now
the
3rd
brooklyn
beer
i
have
reviewed
and
they
have
all
been
great
beers
brooklyn
is
now
a
clear
number
2
among
my
favorite
american
breweries
great
lakes
being
1
i
really
am
happy
to
have
these
beers
available
and
affordable
here
in
upstate
ny
solid
and
a
welldone
ipa
but
not
outstanding
o
3
5
overall
this
isnt
bad
but
isnt
a
great
either
just
a
good
solid
beer
similar
to
many
from
brooklyn
in
my
opinion
o
had
this
years
ago
and
thought
it
tasted
much
better
than
this
but
i
am
reviewing
the
beer
im
currently
drinking
and
not
the
one
i
had
back
in
2007
i
am
definitely
going
to
rereview
another
batch
of
this
beer
in
the
future
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
aroma
of
caramel
malts
with
a
light
fruitiness
and
some
hops
taste
is
same
as
aroma
palate
is
a
nice
medium
body
carbonation
is
good
finish
is
sweet
malts
fruitiness
some
yeast
flavor
and
midly
hopped
overall
a
good
brew
an
english
with
some
of
the
mineral
note
and
the
dextrin
forms
properly
has
the
feel
but
lacks
the
subtleties
probably
because
its
stale
this
is
mostly
noted
in
the
malt
grain
yeast
esters
its
a
bit
biscuity
but
more
so
grain
harshness
the
esters
that
could
be
possible
are
not
utilized
pour
is
amber
clear
with
a
mild
head
that
looks
english
and
feels
english
nose
of
lemon
hint
of
suntea
palate
is
stale
maybe
thats
it
the
hops
outside
of
a
hoppy
character
and
vegetation
are
well
pine
to
grit
there
is
a
glory
in
an
english
ale
and
i
it
seems
like
this
was
just
a
mind
for
the
i
dont
like
hop
beer
drinker
no
hard
feelings
but
i
feel
like
the
point
was
disregarded
o
compared
to
other
ipas
thus
would
be
even
lower
i
do
not
score
to
style
rather
to
my
tastes
overall
a
pretty
good
ipa
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
by
any
means
but
pretty
good
opinion
this
is
a
decent
beer
there
really
isnt
all
that
much
about
it
that
stands
out
but
it
isnt
flawed
or
anything
i
like
it
that
it
manages
to
show
off
the
caramel
malt
like
it
does
and
that
helps
this
beer
a
lot
that
said
once
i
finish
the
sixer
that
i
got
i
doubt
that
i
will
feel
the
need
to
go
back
to
this
one
unless
i
see
it
on
tap
or
something
hops
is
subtle
but
definitely
in
the
realm
of
ipa
citrus
follows
with
the
subtle
flavor
of
pine
without
too
much
bite
mild
ipa
thats
nice
to
have
in
the
fridge
to
share
with
someone
you
would
rather
not
share
the
good
stuff
with
o
i
almost
feel
like
im
eating
a
fruit
roll
up
it
seems
extremely
fruity
at
times
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
this
is
a
solid
ipa
nothing
to
call
up
friend
in
the
middle
of
the
night
for
just
solid
brewing
here
i
guess
i
am
kind
of
disappointed
that
i
cant
really
taste
any
malts
here
i
taste
a
sweetness
but
no
malt
character
on
the
palate
overall
a
good
drinking
mild
mannered
ipa
o
a
very
decent
ipa
we
have
ourselves
here
variable
tasteful
in
aroma
and
taste
good
for
any
session
poured
a
clear
caramel
amber
maybe
a
shade
darker
head
was
made
up
of
small
bubbles
and
was
fleeting
smelled
hoppy
not
much
in
the
way
of
malt
tasted
pretty
good
had
the
requisite
hops
and
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
relatively
neutral
bitterness
on
the
back
end
overall
a
decent
ipa
good
sessioner
and
the
alcohol
does
not
show
at
all
o
this
is
a
nicely
crafted
ipa
as
long
as
youre
not
expecting
a
giant
hopbomb
nicely
balanced
showcasing
the
malt
along
with
the
hops
clean
and
refreshing
east
coast
fk
you
o
extremely
nice
overall
works
well
on
its
own
or
as
a
session
beer
ogood
got
it
in
a
sampler
12
pack
and
glad
to
have
tried
it
brooklyn
east
ontap
at
the
office
in
summit
nj
a
good
beer
with
strong
flavor
has
a
strong
punch
of
flavor
with
a
moderately
smooth
finish
when
paired
with
appetizers
anything
without
a
lingering
acidic
aftertaste
is
an
asset
in
my
book
goldenred
coloration
is
enticing
but
the
flavor
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
quite
liked
this
beer
and
would
happily
buy
sixers
of
it
for
my
regular
fridge
stock
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
im
really
liking
brooklyn
brewery
and
plan
to
try
more
of
their
stuff
as
often
as
i
can
on
the
whole
a
decent
representation
of
an
english
ipa
pretty
tasty
and
easy
drinking
with
a
nice
balance
between
hops
and
malt
and
decent
versatility
with
food
not
my
favorite
brooklyn
beer
but
not
bad
v
value
since
this
sells
for
the
same
price
as
brooklyn
lager
the
value
is
neutral
i
will
buy
the
lager
just
because
its
more
honest
and
has
a
nicer
label
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
colored
brew
with
a
good
sized
head
on
it
the
head
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
the
smell
has
a
good
amount
of
hops
that
carry
over
into
the
taste
of
the
beer
the
other
flavors
that
pop
up
are
mostly
malts
and
a
slight
tingle
of
citrus
the
mouthfeel
is
very
drinkable
allowing
this
to
be
a
beer
that
could
end
up
being
2
or
3
by
the
end
of
the
night
quite
easy
to
drink
smooth
liked
the
dryness
quite
a
bit
not
the
fruit
juice
blast
that
often
accompanies
an
ipa
which
i
love
by
the
way
but
still
a
drinkable
brew
certainly
one
id
buy
again
at
this
price
drinkability
overall
nice
but
not
an
english
ipa
a
refreshingly
hoppy
beer
without
a
massive
hop
whallop
but
when
i
look
at
what
i
reviewed
of
this
in
a
bottle
vs
what
others
have
said
im
wondering
if
the
tap
was
mislabeled
the
handle
clearly
says
brooklyn
ipa
and
it
definitely
has
the
classic
brooklyn
logo
but
its
not
like
the
east
india
pale
ale
i
had
in
a
bottle
although
it
does
appear
to
match
a
few
of
the
reviews
here
well
regardless
of
if
this
is
the
right
beer
or
not
it
was
a
very
good
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
i
would
easily
have
another
a
solidly
good
american
ipa
and
thats
how
ive
rated
it
as
it
is
not
an
english
style
despite
the
east
india
title
id
knock
it
down
to
3
5
across
the
top
if
i
was
going
for
style
but
i
really
cant
here
this
was
a
damn
good
beer
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
english
ipa
not
to
be
confused
with
american
ipa
in
fact
after
consulting
bjcp
guidelines
ive
noticed
that
brooklyn
eipa
is
one
of
their
commercial
examples
for
the
style
you
should
not
expect
highly
hopped
beer
as
it
would
be
inappropriate
it
will
not
compare
with
dogfish
heads
60
minute
ipa
or
russian
rivers
blind
pig
but
its
great
for
its
style
o
i
think
they
accomplished
what
they
were
going
for
in
an
english
ipa
okay
drinkability
at
best
i
would
get
tired
of
it
after
two
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
its
fairly
well
done
m
the
carbonation
was
relatively
low
for
an
ipa
this
ale
was
quite
watery
as
well
d
thoroughly
enjoyed
drinking
this
one
and
certainly
wouldnt
pass
up
another
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
as
far
as
flavor
goes
but
all
in
all
this
take
on
the
english
style
is
well
rounded
overall
a
very
nice
tasting
beer
but
if
you
score
it
within
the
style
it
wont
score
well
i
dont
think
it
fits
in
the
style
id
almost
call
this
an
west
coast
influenced
amber
if
someone
asked
me
this
ipa
has
more
of
a
lager
type
feel
for
it
poured
into
my
pint
glass
with
little
to
no
head
highly
carbonated
and
a
copper
brownish
color
smells
grainy
and
even
a
bit
soapy
taste
of
grain
a
little
wheaty
and
a
very
small
hint
of
hops
kind
of
a
joke
to
call
it
an
ipa
but
i
have
never
had
an
ipa
from
east
india
this
beer
taste
like
a
macro
brew
version
better
than
a
bud
light
a
nice
fruity
hop
smell
dominates
the
nose
not
anything
special
for
an
ipa
but
smells
good
a
nice
quite
big
malty
body
goes
nicely
balanced
with
the
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
thanks
bierkraft
although
i
was
shooting
more
for
a
west
coast
ipa
this
is
actually
a
bit
better
than
most
english
pale
ales
from
england
so
i
was
not
too
disappointed
it
certainly
was
a
bit
hoppier
and
had
more
punch
a
dark
golden
colour
in
my
mikasa
goblet
minimal
head
but
did
have
some
lacing
tendencies
smell
is
malted
with
mild
pine
scent
reminiscent
of
marstons
pale
ale
but
better
taste
is
slightly
malty
with
some
bitterness
mouthfeeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
some
bite
overall
a
good
english
ipa
and
a
soso
american
ipa
i
graded
as
if
it
was
an
english
vice
my
hopes
cheers
mate
overall
a
very
solid
version
of
an
english
ipa
pour
resulted
in
is
little
better
than
a
finger
head
which
didnt
last
long
lace
is
little
and
likes
to
slide
color
is
a
5
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
just
a
bit
hazy
smell
is
earthy
with
aromas
of
spicy
flowers
black
soil
tea
citrus
and
sweet
malt
taste
is
a
little
harsh
with
flavors
of
grapefruit
dark
soil
tea
and
sweet
malt
i
was
hoping
for
more
sourness
but
not
quite
there
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
full
and
tingly
but
offset
by
the
film
feeling
at
the
back
of
my
tongue
better
than
your
run
of
the
mill
yard
work
beer
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
again
poured
medium
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
and
modest
lacing
nose
was
floral
spice
and
breads
taste
for
some
reason
initially
reminded
me
of
gin
i
found
it
spicy
grassy
slightly
resinous
and
floral
with
a
backload
of
slightly
sweet
bready
malt
finish
was
mostly
dry
and
slightly
bitter
interesting
beer
but
not
one
ill
care
to
repeat
overall
i
was
hoping
for
this
to
be
an
ipa
like
the
label
suggested
it
definitely
tastes
english
though
it
was
fine
but
not
something
i
was
a
big
fan
of
o
a
decent
enough
beer
and
easy
to
drink
for
a
beer
nearing
7
but
theres
really
nothing
too
memorable
about
this
one
for
me
more
or
less
a
middle
of
the
pack
ipa
overall
for
an
ipa
this
really
is
not
very
bitter
however
i
do
not
like
overly
bitter
english
ipas
because
the
english
hops
are
somewhat
offputting
for
me
when
overused
i
like
american
bitterness
that
said
the
hops
do
provide
a
subtle
balance
to
the
pretty
damn
good
malts
ultimately
i
like
it
even
if
it
is
in
no
way
a
good
ipa
fix
d
again
a
bitter
and
dry
taste
overall
proving
that
eipas
arent
joke
and
over
hopping
isnt
just
a
problem
with
homebrews
this
is
a
beer
to
have
a
nice
meal
with
and
maybe
comeback
for
seconds
or
thirds

drinkability
pleasantly
bitter
skillfully
balanced
i
found
this
beer
to
go
very
well
w
food
i
tried
it
last
night
w
bbq
pork
chops
very
highly
sessionable
english
ipa
w
malty
balance
i
highly
recommend
overall
well
if
anyone
did
their
homework
true
ipas
from
which
they
were
conceived
where
pretty
much
high
7
to
8
abv
beers
with
just
a
sht
ton
of
east
kent
golding
hops
thrown
into
it
to
preserve
the
beer
i
dont
know
how
english
ipas
today
are
weak
but
everyones
retarded
for
this
classification
bs
this
beer
is
close
to
that
tho
not
my
true
favorite
ipa
i
love
piney
citrusy
bitterbomb
this
brew
has
its
own
stance
not
bad
at
all
just
different
o
this
is
terrific
and
is
very
quaffable
this
beer
pours
a
clear
goldenbronze
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
floral
hops
and
mandarin
oranges
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
very
floral
with
some
orange
and
a
hint
of
grapefruit
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
certainly
drink
again
overall
drinkability
overbearing
and
complex
without
a
focal
point
very
clear
copper
colored
brew
very
active
small
bubbles
for
a
while
form
a
little
white
head
scent
is
more
of
an
english
ipa
than
american
which
i
now
notice
is
the
style
so
that
makes
sense
malty
floral
scent
sweet
caramel
malt
front
a
bit
of
bittering
but
mostly
floral
hops
reminds
me
of
what
i
used
to
think
an
ipa
would
taste
like
prehop
explosion
thats
taken
place
over
the
last
5
years
or
so
mouth
is
thin
to
medium
pretty
sharp
i
certainly
have
no
complaints
about
this
one
o
not
alot
of
taste
just
malts
not
recommended
1
and
done
for
me
poured
into
my
surly
pint
glass
looks
slightly
hazy
orange
in
color
the
aroma
is
lightly
peppered
citrus
with
a
nice
bready
character
the
flavor
is
nicely
bitter
with
zesty
citrus
notes
mouthfeel
is
very
light
great
session
ipa
i
could
easily
knock
a
few
of
these
back
welcome
to
mn
brooklyn
o
just
not
a
beer
for
me
i
tried
it
didnt
like
it
and
will
move
on
to
something
else
pours
a
light
brownamber
clor
with
solid
white
head
head
sits
steady
and
holds
for
a
while
excellent
lacing
very
nice
looking
brew
smell
is
faintly
of
tropical
fruit
hoppiness
but
not
strong
taste
is
malt
forward
bready
and
almost
like
a
slightly
hopped
version
of
brooklyns
pale
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
a
decent
throwin
eipa
in
the
brooklyn
variety
pack
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
but
dont
mind
it
in
the
variety
pakc
overall
brooklyn
eipa
plays
to
the
strengths
of
grains
that
many
brewers
try
to
cover
up
and
it
shines
through
the
drinkability
might
not
be
there
but
when
you
take
the
time
to
consider
the
complexity
that
grains
can
impart
on
a
beer
dont
overlook
brooklyn
eipa
the
brewers
certainly
havent
o
i
dont
think
this
is
a
bad
beer
however
it
just
doesnt
smell
or
taste
like
an
ipa
to
me
i
doubt
i
would
buy
it
again
it
has
a
dry
bitter
darkness
that
i
think
is
right
for
the
style
i
think
this
brew
deserves
a
serious
multibeer
session
i
will
try
to
do
that
some
other
time
though
d
this
is
certainly
a
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
and
is
drinkable
but
im
failing
to
find
the
hops
in
this
beer
this
has
got
the
malty
taste
of
a
eipa
but
im
hopless
right
now
and
wishing
i
werent
drinkable
is
an
understatement
mellow
and
flavorful
really
enjoyable
beer
balanced
and
above
all
tasty
yet
again
the
mighty
eastcoast
strikes
again
upon
the
eipa
society
as
most
of
the
brews
from
brooklyn
i
say
this
has
a
great
balance
true
true
mild
yet
hoppy
sensation
makes
the
tastdrones
go
nuts
sugar
can
be
discovered
once
you
stick
your
nose
in
i
would
say
that
biscuits
is
also
i
player
on
this
field
the
best
part
about
this
brew
is
that
it
contains
so
much
taste
for
a
bargain
price
of
pretty
much
nothing
compared
to
other
in
the
same
style
pours
a
nice
egg
shell
white
two
and
half
finger
head
of
tight
bubbles
this
fades
to
a
solid
bubbly
cap
with
big
lacing
clinging
to
the
glass
initially
i
get
a
big
floral
nose
some
fruit
sweet
malts
some
alcohol
as
well
but
in
a
good
way
which
accentuates
the
other
smells
tastes
sweet
and
malty
at
first
some
earthy
hops
piney
some
crystal
malts
woodiness
quite
nice
for
an
english
ipa
a
good
bit
of
lingering
bitterness
some
coating
oilyness
medium
bodied
mediumhigh
carbonation
i
enjoyed
this
one
to
the
end
another
good
beer
from
brooklyn
1
50
a
single
from
whole
foods
bargin
bin
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
thick
yellowish
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
smells
of
earthy
and
piny
hops
and
a
little
biscuit
tastes
of
earthy
hops
sweet
malts
and
a
bit
of
grain
quite
nice
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
there
is
a
medium
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
the
cpj
really
this
is
not
an
ipa
by
any
standard
im
sorry
the
apperance
is
good
a
amber
color
but
the
taste
is
literally
like
someone
took
wet
leaves
and
fermented
them
and
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
like
a
chili
pepper
i
guess
as
others
have
said
but
nowhere
do
i
get
a
bitter
hop
profile
or
nose
the
mouthfeel
was
lightly
carbonated
as
far
as
drinking
goes
by
all
means
if
someone
wants
a
trade
please
feel
free
i
wont
drink
this
anytime
soon
please
brooklyn
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
been
waiting
to
find
some
brooklyn
e
i
p
a
for
awhile
finally
found
it
no
idea
why
it
took
so
long
taste
is
pretty
good
not
too
hoppy
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
hop
to
it
color
is
good
drank
it
straight
from
bottle
very
good
would
recommend
to
drink
if
opportunity
arises
drinkability
why
brooklyn
brewery
why
dear
god
why
if
i
had
brewed
this
i
would
have
thrown
it
out
i
bought
a
12
mix
pack
of
brooklyns
brews
and
luckily
there
is
only
2
of
these
in
the
pack
it
seems
like
brooklyn
might
have
added
this
eipa
to
the
pack
to
get
rid
of
them
even
the
mouthfeel
is
off
pretty
easy
drinking
all
things
considered
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
balance
and
a
bit
more
punch
from
the
hops
but
i
can
live
with
it
maybe
my
palate
is
evolving
d
pretty
drinkable
the
bitter
and
dryness
of
it
is
a
bit
off
putting
but
its
nothing
terrible
this
was
the
first
brooklyn
beer
ive
sampled
very
impressed
i
plan
to
find
some
more
of
their
styles
to
sample
found
at
the
grille
room
in
portland
maine
i
was
told
it
was
a
brookly
ipa
not
east
india
pale
ale
and
i
have
to
say
this
was
a
much
more
enjoyable
ipa
than
what
i
recall
of
the
east
india
version
i
tried
previously
from
the
bottle
so
im
not
sure
if
i
have
the
wrong
variety
here
but
i
dont
see
any
other
ipa
choices
under
the
brooklyn
flag
and
this
did
not
seem
anything
like
an
imperial
ipa
so
this
brew
is
a
clear
pale
gold
color
with
a
whispy
white
film
on
top
and
moderate
rings
of
lacing
the
aroma
offers
citrus
biscuit
firm
but
polite
the
flavor
is
bright
grapefruitlemon
and
tangy
orange
rye
bread
medium
light
bodied
with
a
fairly
crisp
feel
this
is
a
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
ipa
with
a
mellow
base
and
bright
highlights
what
a
nice
balance
highly
recommended
pours
a
clear
yelloworange
with
a
thin
head
very
nice
sweet
bready
malt
with
muted
pine
hops
aroma
taste
starts
off
piney
then
to
grapefruit
to
grapefruit
zest
that
lingers
clean
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
just
a
bit
thin
smell
is
better
than
taste
but
could
have
more
than
one
d
very
easy
to
drink
with
the
balance
could
drink
a
few
without
pummeling
the
palate
d
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
for
the
style
especially
considering
its
relatively
high
alcohol
content
not
a
fan
md
im
not
sure
what
this
beer
is
trying
to
be
ipa
east
ipa
thought
this
was
supposed
to
be
more
on
the
malty
side
but
im
not
seeing
it
ive
had
better
ipas
this
is
decent
but
not
my
goto
drinkability
this
is
an
ok
beer
nothing
horrible
i
could
set
back
a
couple
during
one
setting
worth
a
try
maybe
not
the
best
ipa
ive
ever
had
but
solid
none
the
less
the
citrus
aromas
seem
to
be
pushed
to
the
backgound
which
i
think
is
a
bit
unusual
for
an
ipa
drinkability
easy
to
drink
a
good
sessionable
ipa
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
people
who
dont
normally
like
ipa
as
it
is
not
a
hop
bomb
like
people
think
of
ipas
the
mouthfeel
has
slightly
aboveaverage
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
this
beer
would
be
very
drinkable
except
for
the
off
tastes
i
get
from
the
hops
other
than
that
it
goes
down
pretty
easily
d
drinkability
is
not
the
best
with
this
one
overall
i
have
to
say
that
im
a
bit
dissapointed
with
this
offering
from
brooklyn
they
are
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
but
i
just
dont
think
this
one
measure
up
d
not
to
impressed
with
this
ipa
well
this
was
an
all
good
beer
will
dare
to
drink
it
more
times
d
the
drinkability
is
decent
on
this
one
this
is
a
pretty
good
ipa
but
its
certainly
not
the
best
ive
had
i
like
this
beer
though
and
id
drink
it
again
overall
decent
beer
the
aroma
is
this
ones
weakness
the
things
that
i
might
ding
this
beer
on
as
needing
style
points
whether
english
ipa
or
american
ipa
pale
in
comparison
to
the
very
delicious
fruity
character
presented
by
the
hops
extremely
inviting
on
draft
juicy
and
hop
forward
d
no
hint
of
alcohol
could
have
a
few
meh
a
bit
too
thick
and
syrupy
tending
to
clog
your
gullet
the
taste
is
ok
but
the
hops
are
stale
tasting
and
the
good
flavors
rye
mint
are
overshadowed
by
a
cardboard
flavor
and
the
goopy
mouthfeel
not
much
of
an
ipa
my
standards
the
smell
is
not
noteworthy
just
drystale
hops
on
top
of
normal
adjunct
beer
not
a
winner
but
ok
i
can
pull
out
some
good
flavors
of
grapefruit
and
smell
some
nice
meadow
smells
but
i
have
to
make
an
effort
skip
this
one
almost
an
amber
color
with
a
sizeable
head
that
dissipates
slowly
leaving
decent
lacing
behind
nose
is
of
pine
and
flowers
mostly
although
a
bit
of
sweetness
shines
through
bitterness
dominates
the
taste
buds
but
not
in
an
overwhelming
way
i
say
this
because
other
flavors
including
a
mellow
sweetness
give
it
a
good
complex
taste
mouthfeel
is
on
the
chewy
side
as
per
usual
in
the
style
drinkibility
is
fairly
high
i
could
drink
several
more
if
i
wanted
d
drinks
pretty
easily
nothing
unpleasant
or
overpowering
aftertaste
is
pleasant
enough
this
might
be
a
little
one
note
but
still
a
nice
beer
wasnt
wowed
but
i
wouldnt
pass
on
one
in
the
future
its
really
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
drinkability
love
this
one
great
well
balanced
example
of
the
style
very
mild
for
an
engish
ipa
but
the
drinkability
is
good
d
very
good
the
alcohol
is
masked
for
the
most
part
so
i
could
have
several
of
these

beer
d
i
was
excited
about
this
and
thoroughly
disappointed
the
combination
of
perfume
and
black
licorice
taste
is
not
pleasant
there
is
some
redeeming
tasty
hop
quality
but
you
have
to
dig
for
it
not
what
i
expected
from
this
brewery
overall
pretty
much
a
dead
on
representation
of
an
english
ipa
this
is
probably
what
those
ipas
tasted
like
when
they
got
to
india
its
not
for
everyone
but
a
great
representation
of
the
style
which
is
a
great
relationship
except
its
really
not
too
tasty
still
i
got
to
take
a
cool
picture
with
it
so
theres
that
drinkability
is
average
a
well
done
version
of
this
style
drinkability
prime
example
of
the
style
well
hopped
abv
is
adequate
and
the
fresh
and
clean
taste
only
enhance
its
drinkability
drink
although
this
is
an
above
average
beer
it
is
nothing
spectacular
worth
a
try
but
there
are
better
ipas
out
there
the
taste
starts
with
a
malty
carbonation
it
builds
into
a
mix
of
earthy
hops
and
crystal
malts
it
ends
with
a
bitter
hop
flavor
that
lingers
it
is
a
unique
hop
flavor
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
malty
up
front
with
an
almost
toffee
sweetness
and
a
moderate
to
mild
bitterness
at
the
back
this
is
a
hugely
bland
ipa
even
for
an
english
ipa
medium
body
with
fairly
brisk
carbonation
reasonably
crisp
but
overall
hard
to
be
a
fan
with
what
feels
like
a
mishmash
of
competing
flavors
not
bad
but
not
as
good
as
many
ipas
im
a
fan
of
sour
beers
however
so
for
me
its
certainly
drinkable
just
not
as
rewarding
as
most
other
ipas
ive
had
its
also
cheaper
in
the
nyc
area
by
about
2
a
sixpack
so
its
not
a
bad
choice
if
youre
looking
for
a

with

taste
not

dry
with
a
nice
yeastiness
faint
alcohol
and
not
as
hoppy
as
expected
feels
quite
smooth
on
the
tongue
overall
not
a
bad
ipa
but
not
the
best
out
there
worth
a
try
definitely
drinkable
but
might
be
a
bit
overpowering
after
a
few
the
taste
wasnt
far
ahead
either
a
half
decent
malt
base
with
a
very
weak
hop
profile
maybe
it
was
the
shipping
maybe
it
was
the
storage
or
the
beers
travel
through
indian
beaureaucracy
the
hops
were
hospitalized
for
sure
there
was
hardly
any
aftertaste
just
some
oiliness
that
pasted
your
palate
the
brooklyn
lager
definitely
packaged
itself
well
and
survived
the
drift
to
india
the
eipa
lost
out
well
only
if
i
could
taste
this
fresh
it
would
be
another
story
altogether
marketed
as
english
pale
ale
i
found
this
one
too
citric
and
i
thought
it
lacked
sweetness
still
an
interesting
ipa
we
find
this
ale
highly
drinkable
due
its
balance
of
hop
and
malt
complexity
along
with
the
fact
that
it
holds
its
own
with
food
the
midlevel
abv
6
9
does
not
result
in
even
a
hint
of
alcohol
sweetness
this
comes
across
as
a
distinctly
american
impression
of
a
british
beer
with
its
pronounced
earthy
hop
flavors
and
pleasant
lingering
bitterness
a
well
puttogether
beer
ok
overall
i
really
liked
this
one
it
really
hit
the
spot
it
seems
like
i
like
it
more
than
most
and
that
might
be
because
it
tasted
very
fresh
to
me
maybe
its
because
it
doesnt
taste
at
all
like
an
english
style
ipa
and
tastes
more
like
an
american
one
and
people
are
grading
against
the
style
no
matter
i
really
liked
this
one
and
recommend
it
cheers
overall
this
beer
is
nearly
perfectly
average
the
hops
are
dominant
as
they
should
be
but
they
are
not
powerfully
bitter
even
for
an
english
version
of
the
style
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
seem
a
bit
muted
of
course
theres
nothing
wrong
necessarily
with
the
evenness
of
this
beers
characteristics
but
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
in
any
way
d
a
bit
to
weak
in
smell
and
taste
for
being
an
ipa
pleasant
floral
nose
with
a
bit
of
fresh
cut
grass
and
gentle
sweetness
tastes
measurably
more
lively
with
an
increase
in
the
floral
hoppiness
and
a
nice
sting
of
bitterness
malts
are
mildy
sweet
and
plenty
biscuity
a
bit
of
leafiness
seems
to
be
present
very
well
balanced
beer
with
a
good
full
feel
good
stuff
not
a
bad
beer
has
a
pretty
billowy
head
and
good

weak

this
beer
is
really
enjoyable
with
the
hops
not
being
very
harsh
ill
call
it
a
good

ipa
d
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
fun
to
drink
and
not

harsh
alcohol
bites
ever
so
slightly
but
is
mostly
well
hidden
d
im
a
fan
not
an
overly
complex
beer
but
i
could
down
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
an
ok
beer
no
more
no
less
i
wonder
if
it
maybe
is
a
little
bit
tired
it
really
opens
up
on
my
tongue
this
beer
drinks
quite
well
i
get
some
more
pine
notes
in
the
flavor
low
bitterness
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
with
an
oily
texture
and
a
creamy
head
but
spot
on
for
crispness
and
spunk
the
finish
was
dry
and
very
clean
good
alcohol
strength
but
lacks
a
certain
something
that
other
ipas
i
have
had
i
imagine
the
draught
version
will
be
quite
tasty
aekaug

for
the

a
friend
acquired
a

of
this
and
a
few
of
us
during

weekend
plowed
through
it
quite
well
in
that
sense
solid
flavor
though
nothing
about
this
one
is
very
strong
the
second
sip
brings
more
toasty
notes
from
the
malt
along
with
a
mild
piney
to
chewy
resinous
hop
flavor
seems
that
this
one
takes
a
few
sips
to
really
hit
the
tastebuds
correctly
pretty
good
the
moutfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
which
i
considered
to
be
too
hoppy
and
bitter
for
my
tastes
golden
in
carbonation
and
body
i
will
not
seek
this

offering
overall
an
alright
ipa
that
is
slightly
more
dank
and
resinous
in
hop
profile
it
was
alright
but
nothing
too
special
overall
with
me
likely
taking
other
ipas
of
comparable
price
and
abv
over
this
one
o
it
is
standard
but
this
is
a
very
well
done
ipa
that
is
vibrant
enough
to
make
it
worth
your
while
o
great
everyday
ipa
its
mellow
and
drinkable
the
malt
balances
the
hop
nicely
making
it
extremely
versatile
the
only
downside
to
being
a
well
rounded
beverage
means
that
it
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
particular
way
in
the
hops
department
dont
know
why
this
beer
garners
such
unenthusiastic
reviews
i
just
had
one
bought
at
random
and
its
a
delightful
surprise
the
flavor
is
citrusy
without
being
over
the
top
and
there
is
enough
hoppiness
and
malt
to
be
rewarding
true
it
doesnt
really
come
across
as
an
ipa
and
i
think
thats
part
of
the
problem
what
is
it
exactly
honestly
i
dont
care
its
worth
having
on
hand
this
beer
is
a
little
different
from
other
ipa
i
have
tried
but
i
must
say
that
i
find
it
agreeable
and
like
it
more
as
i
drink
more
at
first
i
was
a
little
put
off
by
the
buttery
component
to
the
taste
but
i
took
a
liking
to
it
once
i
opened
a
second
bottle
and
actually
find
it
interesting
the
taste
is
less
bitter
than
others
of
this
style
and
it
seems
like
an
ipa
that
most
will
find
at
least
acceptable
give
it
a
try
and
let
us
know
what
you
think
o
overall
an
ok
beer
glad
to
try
it
not
bad
but
a
bit
of
style
confusion
at
first
a
mango
citrus
like
west
coast
style
ipa
then
the
buttery
malt
tries
to
balance
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
overall
this
is
a
grand
beer
id
buy
a
sixer
arcadia
ipa
3
55
an
orange
amber
hued

with
a
medium

some

is

a

ending
is
a
combination
of
sweet

mild
grapefruit
with
some
floral

for
balance
a
very
good
tasty
and
enjoyable
brew
overall
arcadia
falls
a
bit
short
for
me
most
of
the
time
i
wish
i
knew
if
the
beer
i
was
drinking
from
them
was
fresh
but
of
course
no
freshness
date
to
be
found
o
a
drier
english
ipa
but
its
very
clean
and
crisp
nothing
too
exciting
but
decent
overall
a
quite
solid
eipa
good
clean
malt
flavors
and
subdue
hop
presence
with
strong
bitterness
i
like
this
one
quite
a
lot
a
rather
unique
take
on
an
ipa
yet
again
could
be
because
its
of
the
english
variety
and
its
very
easy
drinking
would
be
pretty
much
the
perfect
ipa
to
drink
after
a
long
summer
day
as
its
not
cloying
isnt
too
bitter
and
is
insanely
drinkable
very
tasty
ipa
a
very
standard
ipa
very
easy
drinking
nothing
too
special
but
not
bad
by
any
means
nice
three
finger
head
with
scattered
lacing
and
decent
retention
on
a
cloudy
copper
body
lots
of
pear
in
the
aroma
more
so
than
any
other
ipa
i
have
had
also
with
some
orange
peel
and
little
on
the
malt
side
more
pear
heavy
in
the
flavor
with
a
lot
of
green
apple
again
light
on
the
malts
some
caramel
and
floral
notes
as
well
with
hint
of
metallic
flavors
in
the
finish
medium
body
and
fairly
highly
carbonated
not
a
bad
ipa
certainly
unique
with
nice
flavors
not
a
malt
forward
beer
but
enough
malts
are
there
to
provide
some
flavors
pours
a
darker
almost
brownish
rusty
copper
cloudy
and
unfiltered
head
is
modest
and
lacing
is
punctuated
as
fine
foamy
dots
nose
isnt
recognizably
floral
ipa
like
actually
showing
more
malt
and
sweet
than
anticipated
for
an
ipa
mouthfeel
has
lower
carbonation
for
this
bottle
but
is
fine
in
character
like
champagne
bitter
notes
are
late
a
sweet
not
too
dry
note
early
the
echo
of
bitter
notes
not
well
extended
this
wont
last
long
for
an
ipa
which
for
an
ipa
is
usually
not
the
case
in
its
echo
i
mean
perhaps
this
is
better
considered
a
mild
session
ale
to
my
tongue
the
hop
notes
giving
is
a
lower
ibu
if
i
were
to
guess
i
wouldnt
pass
this
up
on
tap
or
at
a
party
but
given
other
ipas
out
there
i
wouldnt
take
six
id
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
again
ive
had
a
few
english
ipas
that
were
hard
to
drink
this
one
is
no
problem
cant
really
taste
the
alcohol
either
im
certainly
not
an
english
ipa
expert
o
this
is
a
good
ipa
but
not
an
outstanding
ipa
it
has
a
good
strong
hop
forward
flavor
but
nothing
to
standout
in
a
crowded
field
of
ipas
o
enjoyable
with
some
uniqueness
to
the
flavor
with
the
fermentedpeach
flavor
not
overly
complex
o
this
was
quite
good
and
gave
me
more
than
i
was
expecting
out
of
an
english
style
ipa
it
stood
up
well
to
some
habenerojack
cheese
once
it
settled
own
i
saw
it
was
a
tanamber
color
theres
a
faded
but
still
noticeable
hop
presence
with
a
citrusy
aroma
the
flavor
has
a
nice
hop
bitterness
i
pick
up
a
subdued
citrus
hop
flavor
with
a
mellow
bittering
and
a
pleasing
malt
finish
its
a
testament
to
the
malt
profile
that
it
has
held
up
even
as
the
hops
have
faded
i
shared
this
with
my
pops
overall
great
session
ipa
o
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
this
one
i
have
a
sneaking
suspicion
that
this
may
be
old
but
without
a
bottle
date
i
have
no
way
of
telling
i
feel
this
is
a
pretty
good
interpretation
of
the
english
style
ipa
overall
i
was
not
overly
fond
of
this
beer
the
flavor
was
the
best
part
but
it
was
mainly
just
above
average
o
as
is
this
is
a
solid
englishstyle
ipa
if
the
flavor
profile
werent
so
odd
and
offputting
it
would
potentially
be
a
wonderful
take
on
the
style
i
feel
that
this
one
needs
a
bit
more
work
to
reach
its
full
potential
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
i
personally
recommend
the
brooklyn
east
india
pale
ale
and
the
sam
smith
ipa
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
english
ipa
d
a
blend
of
english
and
us
styles
the
malts
are
a
bit
dry
and
it
lacks
the
caramelly
richness
often
associated
with
british
interpretations
but
though
it
might
lean
toward
being
clean
it
does
have
hints
of
esters
and
diacetyl
the
hopping
is
done
to
a
bold
us
level
however
it
is
not
a
cascade
clone
or
super
dank
it
does
have
some
citrus
but
mixed
right
in
with
an
herbal
earthy
resiny
profile
that
is
more
uk
nicely
drinkable
7212011
its
very
smooth
and
slick
theres
enough
body
and
carbonation
to
keep
things
positive
not
the
best
beer
to
come
out
of
the
woodwork
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangish
amber
color
there
is
about
2fingers
of
offwhite
head
resting
on
top
the
head
has
decent
retention
and
it
leaves
some
scattered
lace
behind
on
the
glass
the
nose
has
a
nice
citrusy
piney
hop
aroma
to
it
and
there
is
a
good
amount
of
malty
sweetness
here
as
well
there
are
also
some
scents
of
caramel
fruit
and
some
toffee
the
taste
follows
the
nose
pretty
well
it
is
hop
forward
and
there
is
a
sweet
malty
backbone
there
are
some
other
flavors
of
caramel
toffee
citrus
and
some
fruity
esters
the
finish
leaves
some
lingering
hop
bitterness
citrus
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
behind
on
the
palate
this
has
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
it
goes
down
easy
and
it
has
a
nice
smooth
quality
to
it
there
is
a
good
amount
of
piney
hop
bitterness
here
some
sweetness
is
in
the
background
and
it
balances
out
the
bitterness
pretty
well
the
hop
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
for
a
bit
this
has
pretty
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
good
and
the
flavor
is
nice
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
i
think
it
is
worth
checking
out
i
would
drink
this
one
again
o
i
really
like
this
beer
they
dont
distribute
this
in
upstate
ny
so
its
a
treat
i
will
buy
again
when
i
visit
my
brother
in
cleveland
o
interesting
style
its
basically
halfway
between
a
milder
english
pale
and
a
hoppy
india
pale
ale
not
bad
but
not
spectacular
trying
the
arcadia
ipa
which
is
an
english
style
ipa
so
there
is
not
much
scent
or
taste
outside
of
what
you
would
call
normal
the
beer
poured
a
tan
clear
with
very
thin
white
head
that
is
not
lacing
the
scent
and
taste
are
a
fresh
hop
with
a
slight
malt
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
beer
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
tasty
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
if
you
like
english
style
ipas
poured
this
ipa
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
ipa
poured
an
orangish
color
and
produced
an
off
white
head
good
head
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
of
this
ipa
is
decent
not
as
strong
as
i
would
like
it
to
be
for
an
ipa
notes
of
malt
and
citrus
grapefruit
shine
through
this
beer
is
medium
in
body
malt
backbone
and
bit
on
the
sweet
side
decent
amount
of
citrus
grapefruit
hops
decent
mouthfeel
good
starter
ipa
nothing
that
makes
it
stand
out
however
overall
its
a
tricky
style
where
you
have
to
balance
the
delicate
not
overlyassertive
hops
perfectly
against
a
fragile
malt
profile
this
one
doesnt
screw
it
up
but
doesnt
shine
either
i
much
prefer
goose
islands
ipa
to
this
one
overall
while
this
is
a
decent
stab
at
a
traditional
india
pale
ale
the
excessive
bitterness
holds
it
back
from
being
great
id
gladly
drink
this
if
it
was
offered
to
me
by
a
friend
and
would
probably
grab
a
half
pint
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
a
full
6pack
its
a
quaffable
ipa
that
could
use
some
tweaking
o
i
cant
recommend
any
ipa
fan
to
buy
this
beer
my
initial
impression
from
the
nose
and
taste
was
this
seems
an
awful
lot
like
a
homebrew
oh
well
at
least
i
got
a
sweet
cap
out
of
it
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
decent
looking
copperish
gold
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
on
top
the
lacing
was
pretty
good
looking
on
the
glass
the
smell
had
a
good
amount
of
hoppy
aromas
and
to
it
along
with
a
nice
balance
of
malts
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
hoppy
and
finished
with
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
pretty
smooth
with
a
nice
little
hop
bite
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
overall
this
brew
was
pretty
good
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
orange
in
color
with
a
dense
rocky
offwhite
head
smells
of
vague
citrus
fruit
rind
the
taste
begins
with
a
sweet
orange
followed
by
a
very
herbal
caramel
middle
and
a
hint
of
rye
bread
the
finish
is
citrus
fruit
rind
mouthfeel
is
creamy
pretty
high
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
overall
this
does
not
fall
into
the
explosive
ipa
category
but
it
is
pleasant
and
drinkable
o
i
dont
hate
it
as
an
ipa
i
just
dont
love
it
as
an
example
it
reads
pale
ale
all
over
it
overall
its
on
par
with
a
lot
of
the
english
ipas
i
have
tried
thats
not
necessarily
a
good
thing
you
know
now
that
i
think
about
it
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
watered
down
english
barley
wine
bah
o
solid
beer
for
the
style
the
abv
makes
it
a
good
sessionable
beer
will
buy
it
again
overall
a
solid
beer
and
one
that
i
would
expect
myself
to
buy
again
o
definitely
something
off
here
not
that
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
english
ipas
to
begin
with
drain
pour
unfortunately
overall
this
isnt
one
ill
be
buying
again
but
it
isnt
entirely
unpalatable
overallnotes
well
this
is
a
bit
surprising
for
me
as
ive
enjoyed
this
out
of
the
bottle
before
its
a
nice
beer
but
im
not
so
sure
id
call
it
a
goto
ipa
i
wonder
when
this
batch
was
actually
brewed
as
the
malty
finish
overpowered
the
hops
ill
have
to
try
it
again
it
has
a
nice
unique
refreshing
taste
one
could
easily
drink
a
lot
of
these
and
i
recommend
everyone
to
do
so
pleasant
almost
easy
enough
to
be
a
session
beer
but
for
the
6
abv
purchased
as
part
of
a
mixed
12
pack
this
is
a
tasty
beer
ill
be
rating
the
other
beers
from
ths
12
pack
later
but
ive
tried
them
all
already
and
can
without
hesitation
recommend
that
mixed
12
pack
whether
to
stock
up
for
yourself
or
to
have
on
hand
for
a
party
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
rather
smooth
and
has
a
medium
drinking
with
it
is
going
down
easy
a
very
smooth
and
crisp
beer
very
balanced
flavors
as
well
great
beer
arcadia
brewing
co
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
little
bit
of
white
head
with
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
strong
with
floral
hops
and
thats
about
all
the
taste
starts
with
floral
hops
and
then
ends
with
some
malty
sweetness
the
mouthful
is
slightly
harsh
with
overcarbonation
but
i
would
recommend
trying
this
ipa
d
i
would
pick
in
up
for
price
9
for
6
but
overall
i
prefer
the
400
pound
monkey
and
a
few
other
english
ipas
well
worth
the
price
if
arcadia
ever
distributed
to
indiana
again
drinkability
not
bad
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
but
a
great
4th
or
5th
beer
during
a
session
arcadia
has
always
brewed
great
beer
d
the
drinkability
on
this
is
pretty
high
i
could
easily
go
through
a
couple
pints
of
this
at
a
bar
and
for
and
ipa
the
alcohol
is
not
too
bad
either
overall
very
nice
another
great
beer
from
south
west
michigan
where
the
best
beer
in
the
world
is
brewed
this
ipa
is
a
lush
copper
color
with
a
great
creamy
head
just
a
wonderful
blend
of
hops
and
malt
to
give
it
easy
drinking
session
beer
over
all
not
the
best
ipa
out
there
but
not
to
shabby
either
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
but
almost
a
bit
watered
down
tasting
kind
of
contrasting
i
know
but
hard
to
explain
better
than
that
not
to
knock
this
beer
would
be
a
very
sessionable
ipa
nothing
over
the
top
mellow
but
good
flavors
if
i
were
looking
for
a
nice
pale
ale
with
a
little
extra
twang
i
would
keep
this
in
mind
pours
a
somewhatcloudy
orangecopper
color
with
a
good
white
head
and
a
small
amount
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
thick
collar
and
a
spotty
cap
the
nose
has
a
bit
of
caramel
and
british
pale
malt
along
with
some
herbal
and
earthy
hops
pretty
tame
but
not
bad
the
taste
is
pretty
different
from
the
nose
actually
the
caramel
fades
to
the
background
and
there
are
some
hops
but
the
dominant
flavor
comes
from
a
frutiy
english
ale
strain
the
back
end
is
pretty
bitter
showcasing
the
hops
again
interesting
and
a
decent
take
on
the
eipa
style
certainly
pretty
drinkable
a
delicious
offering
from
arcadia
brewing
and
is
definitely
worth
a
try
theres
very
little
that
detracts
from
this
brews
drinkability
either
this
is
underrated
or
all
the
reviews
are
old
and
its
been
tweaked
overall
this
was
a
mediocre
ipa
the
flavors
were
they
were
just
a
lot
more
weaker
then
they
should
be
a
good
choice
for
someone
getting
into
the
style
but
its
just
no
my
cup
of
tea
pours
into
an
orange
body
with
a
thin
white
head
with
some
good
retention
decent
lacing
and
little
carbonation
it
has
an
orangecitrus
smell
with
a
hint
of
pine
and
some
floral
hops
the
taste
is
an
orange
taste
with
some
grapefruit
grape
pine
a
little
floral
hops
and
a
slight
hint
of
malts
this
ipa
doesnt
seem
to
leave
a
strong
after
taste
and
is
a
smooth
crisp
and
very
drinkable
beer
and
is
by
far
the
best
of
the
three
ipas
i
had
tonight
from
three
different
michigan
breweries
the
only
thing
is
that
the
other
two
are
american
ipa
while
this
is
an
english
ipa
poured
a
cloudy
orange
w
a
good
onefinger
head
that
died
slow
on
top
of
a
real
citric
lemony
aroma
along
with
orange
peel
and
some
sweet
malt
a
mellow
hopbite
but
the
citric
and
spicy
notes
are
perfectly
noticeable
and
theres
a
hint
of
grape
in
the
flavor
as
well
real
smooth
lightbodied
a
hint
of
sweetness
as
it
passes
over
and
then
a
nice
crisp
dry
finish
a
simple
yet
thoroughly
enjoyable
ipa
overall
this
brew
and
company
blows
the
only
thing
i
ever
tasted
that
was
worth
anything
from
arcadia
was
their
scotch
ale
im
gonna
give
the
last
4
out
of
the
6
to
my
cousin
cuz
i
would
rather
have
my
humas
i
really
had
hopes
for
this
company
i
heard
within
the
year
or
so
they
got
a
new
headbrewer
i
thought
of
that
and
their
new
labels
might
have
been
better
but
still
the
same
they
say
english
but
they
mean
crap
drinkability
takes
a
hit
over
the
the
mouthfeel
while
the
taste
is
good
i
do
not
want
to
drink
a
flat
beer
of
this
style
unimpressed
by
arcadia
ipa
there
are
some
very
obvious
defects
in
this
beer
im
not
sure
if
its
supposed
to
be
like
this
first
and
foremost
in
the
aroma
i
smell
that
plasticy
bandaid
chlorinated
smell
that
i
usually
correlate
with
contamination
or
a
hot
fermentation
also
the
fact
that
its
overcarbonated
means
that
it
could
be
an
infection
there
is
bitterness
but
this
is
not
a
good
tasting
beer
with
characteristics
that
i
like
if
its
not
contaminated
then
this
is
a
poorly
made
beer
and
either
way
i
recommend
against
buying
and
or
drinking
this
beer
if
you
get
a
chance
dvery
easy
drinking
d
this
is
very
drinkable
i
could
tear
through
a
six
pack
of
this
in
no
time
md
mouthfeel
is
full
rich
and
creamy
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
good
could
possibly
be
a
bit
fresher
but
overall
not
a
bad
eipa
english
ipa
indeed
a
little
bit
on
the
malty
side
almost
bordering
on
esb
but
hoppy
enough
to
be
as
advertised
dark
amber
almost
brown
no
head
and
no
lace
smells
of
an
average
ipa
although
there
was
a
bit
of
the
alcohol
in
the
pour
mouth
was
average
ipa
a
touch
of
candy
a
touch
of
licorice
but
the
malt
washed
through
and
very
little
after
to
speak
of
mouth
and
earlier
pretty
much
sum
this
up
good
english
ipa
but
lots
of
others
out
there
overall
not
a
bad
michigan
ipa
but
there
are
so
many
better
ones
to
be
had
from
this
great
brewing
state
da
nice
change
next
to
all
of
the
ipas
ive
had
lately
although
it
has
some
different
aromas
and
flavors
going
on
the
bitterness
is
still
nice
and
defined
body
is
nice
and
lively
a
bit
creamy
good
for
the
style
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
an
englishstyle
ipa
which
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
west
coast
hop
bombs
im
used
to
well
done
overall
not
my
type
of
ipa
not
overly
hoppy
like
an
american
and
it
had
some
off
fruit
flavors
here
somewhat
drinkable
if
one
likes
these
flavors
taste
a
good
deal
for
the
english
version
not
as
good
as
hopmouth
but
more
in
line
with
tradition
which
is
a
negative
it
is
definitely
better
than
your
standard
english
ipa
from
the
islands
but
in
the
end
you
just
want
them
to
push
the
envelope
more
into
west
coast
ipa
territory
if
thats
your
bag
toffee
is
nice
and
all
but
id
like
a
little
more
md
nothing
too
overwhelming
or
exciting
but
if
you
want
a
mild
nicely
balanced
ipa
this
is
a
good
start
d
a
decent
english
ipa
despite
the
slight
unbalance
in
the
hopmalt
dynamic
quite
refreshing
and
i
could
knock
a
few
back
no
problem
drinkability
a
decent
brew
if
it
a
little
boring
i
could
certainly
drink
a
few
of
these
and
its
tasty
enough
for
a
session
but
nothing
really
makes
it
stand
out
ive
had
better
from
arcadia
and
hope
to
keep
trying
some
more
however
the
color
is
honeyamber
coupled
with
a
quality
offwhite
head
a
nice
level
of
lacing
acts
as
if
it
is
stitched
to
the
body
of
the
beer
an
excellent
medium
body
and
an
extremely
clean
finish
makes
this
a
highly
enjoyable
beer
for
me
d
did
i
get
a
bad
bottle
or
is
this
just
the
weirdest
ipa
i
ever
had
a
step
up
from
west
coast
hops
and
soap
flavor
yet
no
where
near
what
an
ipa
should
be
wtf
poured
a
bottle
from
the
sixer
i
bought
a
week
ago
into
a
tulip
glass
and
was
impressed
with
the
honey
gold
color
and
light
creamy
head
light
lacing
dissipates
quickly
as
does
the
head
smelled
malts
predominantly
followed
by
hops
with
a
slight
pine
twang
tasted
like
it
smells
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
and
a
citrus
bite
average
mouthfeel
a
bit
on
the
light
side
drinkability
is
good
for
me
and
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
others
who
like
the
style
highly
viscous
with
a
few
tannins
to
remind
you
that
you
are
indeed
drinking
beer
i
have
had
this
on
tap
and
just
bought
a
sixpack
for
a
party
tonight
and
im
sure
this
wont
be
my
last
glass
of
this
ipa
poured
to
a
nice
two
fingered
head
ipa
was
light
brownish
gold
in
color
head
was
white
with
some
overtones
of
gold
head
hung
around
for
a
while
lacing
i
thought
was
average
smelled
slightly
sweet
also
noticed
some
citrus
going
on
and
of
pine
had
that
piney
taste
and
citrus
also
malt
had
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
felt
good
in
the
mouth
carbonation
was
right
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
doesnt
have
the
big
abv
some
other
ipas
have
so
you
could
enjoy
a
few
this
is
a
solid
easy
drinking
ipa
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
you
but
i
expect
it
would
be
very
easy
to
polish
off
a
few
of
these
overall
arcadia
ipa
does
not
quite
meet
my
expectation
arcadia
is
a
fine
brewery
putting
out
many
quality
products
ipa
included
though
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
with
that
being
said
it
does
drink
quite
well
there
are
no
offensive
qualities
and
the
attributes
do
work
well
together
i
would
fine
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
a
given
time
period
good
beer
and
worth
a
try
just
not
my
favorite
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
flavorful
session
beer
with
some
substance
and
is
worth
drinking
for
a
very
long
time
drinkability
this
beer
was
pretty
drinkable
thanks
to
the
malt
backbone
and
the
good
amount
of
carbonation
just
a
general
solid
mouthfeel
i
had
this
from
the
cask
at
the
berkley
front
in
mi
the
beer
is
bright
orange
color
with
a
fine
haze
nearly
clear
but
just
enough
to
haze
to
disperse
light
not
much
foam
but
this
is
a
cask
beer
so
the
aroma
isnt
really
all
that
strong
for
an
ipa
its
hoppy
but
more
like
an
aggressive
pale
ale
mostly
citrusstyle
hops
in
the
smell
and
taste
but
not
strong
enough
for
my
tastes
near
perfect
mouthfeel
from
the
cask
creamy
and
smooth
with
low
carbonation
goes
down
like
water
overall
this
is
solidly
average
like
most
arcadia
beers
i
find
this
is
middle
of
the
road
it
will
only
do
in
a
pinch
or
if
its
the
only
thing
on
cask
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
maize
color
along
the
bottom
of
the
glass
53
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
floral
hops
pine
nuts
slight
wet
hop
slight
citrus
and
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
english
ipa
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
floral
hops
dry
hops
slight
citrus
hint
of
alcohol
and
slight
sweet
malt
background
overall
a
good
blend
and
body
strong
hop
flavors
like
an
american
ipa
but
the
malt
background
is
clearly
english
notes
hmmm
maybe
a
touch
of
a
minor
let
down
after
expecting
something
a
bit
richer
from
the
cask
other
than
that
it
was
a
decent
if
fairly
forgettable
drink
libation
i
like
it
the
price
is
good
the
brew
is
a
well
balanced
and
it
certainly
satisfies
my
hoptooth
the
alcohol
wasnt
even
noticeable
and
i
easily
downed
half
the
sixpack
ill
be
back
for
more
d
goesdown
easy
enough
but
the
hops
seem
to
become
more
and
more
astringent
with
time
making
this
a
little
less
quaffable
than
i
would
like
this
is
a
solid
easy
drinking
ipa
nothing
that
jumps
off
the
page
but
its
quite
tasty
and
id
be
very
pleased
to
be
presented
with
a
pint
as
mentioned
a
few
times
before
it
seems
much
more
american
than
english
in
the
hop
department
although
the
hop
flavor
is
not
over
the
top
so
maybe
they
were
just
going
for
some
modesty
good
stuff
d
fair
or
less
drinkability
this
ipa
was
really
not
inspiring
kind
of
a
onenote
ipa
2
5
the
flavor
is
interesting
very
malty
almost
tastes
like
a
dipa
or
something
similar
the
hops
are
more
citrusy
and
not
that
bitter
in
the
actual
beer
no
aftertaste
at
all
the
second
taste
was
better
than
the
first
more
bitterness
than
the
first
but
it
still
finished
cleanly
overall
a
very
good
ipa
decently
drinkable
but
seems
more
like
an
american
ipa
than
the
english
minus
the
quite
funky
ale
yeast
componants
d
not
bad
and
somewhat
of
a
staple
for
arcadias
line
up
i
would
reach
for
other
arcadia
brews
before
this
one
and
when
in
the
mood
for
an
ipa
this
one
is
further
down
the
pecking
order
d
overall
a
very
drinkable
ipa
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
had
worse
had
better
d
very
sessionable
and
a
lot
better
beer
than
the
arcadia
pale
ale
which
i
have
had
side
by
side
with
this
i
would
happily
drink
more
of
this
from
tasting
notes
on
my
blog
pilgrims
pub
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
frothy
white
head
that
settles
down
to
oily
rings
on
glass
has
a
soft
citrus
and
floral
smell
the
usual
ipa
flavors
of
pine
and
grapefruit
medium
body
zesty
carbonation
a
toned
down
ipa
but
never
less
enjoyable
this
beer
is
not
a
hop
bomb
and
may
be
a
disappointment
to
those
who
look
for
that
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
good
english
ipa
highly
sessionable
a
balanced
mediumtobig
beer
taste
at
a
reasonable
abv
drinkability
not
bad
but
there
are
certainly
some
more
flavorful
ipas
out
there
drinkability
is
pretty
nice
a
fine
example
of
the
style
a
pleasant
surprise
well
done
i
had
seen
arcadias
beers
before
in
wisconsin
but
was
surprised
to
see
quite
a
few
of
them
in
the
chicago
area
i
had
the
ipa
from
the
beer
engine
at
sheffields
in
chicago
not
sure
if
id
feel
differently
about
this
beer
if
id
had
it
from
the
bottle
or
from
a
conventional
tap
but
this
beer
struck
me
as
being
nothing
special
color
was
a
hazy
straw
color
with
the
smooth
head
of
miniscule
bubbles
that
is
typical
for
a
beerengine
poured
beer
aroma
was
virtually
nonexistent
and
taste
was
only
slightly
more
pronounced
it
wasnt
quite
a
widgeted
can
of
boddingtons
in
terms
of
its
mildmanneredness
but
throw
in
some
discernible
amount
of
hops
and
youve
got
a
pretty
good
approximation
of
my
experience
with
this
beer
pretty
unexciting
stuff
the
high
marks
in
my
review
aroma
mouthfeel
come
from
the
beerengine
pour
primarily
rather
than
the
beer
jordan
bottle
pours
a
deep
amber
almost
brown
with
a
thin
head
very
strong
hoppy
citrus
and
pine
aroma
taste
is
fairly
astringent
and
follows
the
aroma
with
hops
and
pine
predominant
with
some
citrus
as
well
mouth
feel
is
medium
and
dry
bitterness
is
very
much
there
but
not
overpowering
i
need
to
drink
more
ipas
to
get
a
better
sense
for
the
style
cheers
t
the
hops
which
comes
through
through
on
the
smell
is
very
balanced
not
a
lot
of
spice
for
an
ipa
but
its
very
high
quality
beer
i
like
a
nice
bitter
spicy
ipa
which
this
is
not
but
i
like
this
beer
nose
is
a
little
grassy
and
lemon
taste
is
moderately
hopped
with
good
citrus
blends
mouth
feel
is
medium
but
not
remarkable
overall
a
pretty
good
tasting
beer
always
been
of
fan
of
arcadia
and
that
doesnt
stop
with
the
beer
in
the
end
the
question
of
drink
ability
is
am
i
looking
forward
to
drinking
this
beer
again
no
way
better
ipas
out
there
medium
bodied
and
lightly
creamy
smooth
and
clean
but
this
beer
gets
kind
of
heavy
toward
the
end
especially
for
what
it
seems
ought
to
be
a
somewhat
sessionable
beer
nice
dark
bronze
color
and
opaque
clarity
moderate
offwhite
head
with
big
ipa
bubbles
smells
like
sweet
pine
and
lemony
hops
kind
of
like
fruit
loops
and
pine
cones
in
a
very
good
way
mild
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
flavor
with
a
sweet
fruity
citrus
note
and
a
touch
of
pine
very
pleasant
and
not
overpowering
in
the
least
as
some
ipas
can
be
good
moderate
body
and
carbonation
and
easy
to
drink
very
good
beer
moreys
bottom
line
not
band
but
i
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
this
beer
this
sample
was
given
to
me
as
will
be
the
case
with
my
next
one
d
this
is
a
great
ipa
and
one
of
the
better
tasting
ones
i
have
tried
d
while
there
are
other
ipas
here
i
like
more
for
the
price
you
can
not
go
wrong
with
it
i
could
drink
a
whole
sixer
of
this
without
even
thinking
about
it
twice
nice
beer
arcadia
big
hop
bite
slightly
bready
note
lots
of
bitterness
up
front
and
a
lingering
bitterness
to
follow
not
a
bad
imbibe
but
not
real
subtle
in
its
approach
good
but
theres
better
big
hop
ales
out
there
with
added
dimension
pair
well
with
jamaican
jerk
wings
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
thin
creme
head
nose
is
citric
bitter
hops
one
dimensional
but
full
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
flavor
is
more
hoppy
than
i
would
have
imagined
for
the
style
but
its
nice
salty
and
earthy
tones
that
appear
and
then
fade
fairly
soon
on
though
as
it
warms
the
piney
citrus
and
salty
tones
show
more
so
and
even
longer
on
the
flavor
ride
feel
has
a
fairly
nipping
carbonation
liquid
is
well
bodied
this
is
a
decent
session
ale
nothing
crazy
but
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
i
think
very
drinkable
i
could
have
several
in
one
sitting
the
beer
is
a
tad
syrupy
very
sweet
in
parts
but
balanced
nicely
against
some
leafy
and
tart
hops
this
is
a
complex
beer
and
well
worth
seeking
out
the
slightly
syrupy
sweet
maltishness
complements
the
slightly
bittering
slightly
acerbic
leafy
hop
the
beer
is
bittering
in
the
finish
but
it
carries
with
it
the
apricot
sweetness
and
a
slight
liqueur
like
consistency
and
character
into
the
finish
as
well
if
nothing
else
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
that
demonstrates
how
the
sweet
malts
and
the
bittering
hops
can
really
play
off
each
other
lchaim
first
beer
after
a
long
night
on
the
second
shift
boy
this
beer
tastes
wonderful
i
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
this
arcadia
offering
in
bridgman
mi
on
march
14
and
wow
what
a
wonderful
beer
i
had
heard
of
arcadia
but
never
tried
a
beer
from
them
so
i
asked
the
sales
clerk
at
midtown
liquors
and
she
said
this
ipa
was
a
top
seller
from
arcadia
and
i
can
see
why
poured
into
my
sam
adams
sensory
glass
and
viola
the
beer
looks
wonderful
smell
too
doesnt
disappoint
but
the
best
thing
going
for
this
ipa
from
arcadia
is
the
taste
mouthful
and
drinkability
at

abv
i
could
drink
this

arcadia
for
a
wonderful

the

for
working
for
them

mouthfeel

on
the
light
side
not
a

the
pretty

character

out
nicely

i
had
about
50

mouthfeel
is

but
the

keep
it
all
in

on

i
find
this

highly
drinkable
either
cooler
where
it
imitates
the

warmer

its

not

this

has
a

is

to

another
one
d
this
beer
was
poor
in
the
approach
but
good
in
the
finish
it
was
a
strange
tasting
for
me
pours
a
hazy
copper
orangeish

with
a

in
the
aroma
a
mix
of
citrus
and
piney
hops

overall
quite
nice
the

goes
only
as

as
the
mouthfeel
in
this
one
the
flavor
is
quite
varied
and
subdued
in
the
aftertaste
working
in
its
favor
yet
the
medium
body
reins
it
in
from
being
a
runaway
slammer
d
a
nice
smooth
ipa
nice
combination
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
the
alcohol
receded
as
i
drank
the

was
indeed
quite
warming

welcome
definitely
a
nice
ipa
to
have
as
the
fall
months
start

head
is

delicious
looking
almondwith
good
retention
and
some
lace
that
slides
away
with
the
head
the
nose
is
hoppy
sweet
and
fruity
this
one
tastes
extra
malty
for
an
ipawith
less
hops
than
i
expected
judging
by
the
nose
i
taste
orange
rind
along
with
some
fresh
fruity
hopsand
a
light
caramely
finish
the
body
is
medium
and
pretty
sticky
with
carbonation
being
on
the
lower
end
of
the
spectrumslightly
dry
finish
for
me
this
offering
by
arcadia
misses
the
mark
when
it
comes
to
hoppagethe
rest
is
acceptable
drinkability
sure
doesnt
taste
like
an
english
ipa
to
me
the
website
says
that
columbus
hops
were
used
and
that
doesnt
sound
very
english
to
me
either
aside
from
that
i
am
not
thrilled
by
the
lemony
element
to
this
beer
d
not
to
bad
fairly
easy
to
drink
i
guess
im
just
a
bigger
fan
of
the
american
style
overall
not
to
bad
on
tap
at
the
maproom
pours
a
rich
hazy
amber
with
little
head
smell
is
like
bandaids
and
malt
with
no
real
hops
in
the
nose
taste
is
thin
gooey
stale
malt
and
again
just
a
lackluster
hop
profile
this
one
was
pretty
much
undrinkable
as
it
was
served
to
me
thin
flavor
aside
from
what
was
already
unappealing
glad
i
tried
it
but
wont
be
looking
for
this
again
im
liking
this
one
more
and
more
every
time
they
couldve
packed
in
a
bit
more
alcohol
however
nice
work
i
would
buy
this
again
it
pours
hazy
amber
almost
orange
with
a
decent
head
but
poor
lacing
the
aroma
is
faint
and
has
a
whiff
of
something
difficult
to
identify
perhaps
a
slight
smokiness
as
it
warms
it
opens
to
a
spicy
orange
character
sort
of
a
marmalade
effect
the
flavor
has
an
odd
bite
a
bit
of
smoke
a
bit
of
marmalade
a
hint
of
apricot
but
of
a
bitter
sort
it
finishes
with
an
herbal
bitterness
almost
like
a
musky
rosemary
the
mouthfeel
is
decently
firm
but
slightly
overcarbonated
which
highlights
the
spicy
marmalade
effect
to
bad
effect
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
unsuccessful
in
my
view
not
what
i
am
after
in
an
ipa
from
either
side
of
the
atlantic
an
easy
choice
to
make
for
a
summery
brew
when
you
still
want
some
hoppy
flavors
going
on
nice
balance
and
easy
to
drink
good
brewing
had
this
a
manyo
times
it
pours
thick
cloudy
copper
with
a
solid
head
the
hops
waft
strongly
from
this
solid
michigan
brew
the
hops
are
definitely
apparent
in
the
taste
and
it
finishes
with
a
delicious
but
mild
bitterness
its
a
pretty
heavy
brew
but
still
drinkable
its
good
but
ive
gotta
take
my
time
with
this
one
gotta
admit
i
have
not
been
impressed
with
arcadias
brews
in
the
past
oddly
sour
and
unappetizing
would
be
my
standard
assessment
wow
good
start
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
huge
frothy
head
on
top
that
leaves
solid
lacing
as
the
beer
drains
a
nice
surprise
nose
is
fairly
mild
toffee
malt
and
then
a
touch
of
smoothish
hop
bitterness
to
close
out
flavor
is
similarly
mild
light
caramel
malt
light
sourness
much
milder
than
in
most
arcadia
offerings
and
then
light
floral
hop
presence
a
definite
woodiness
in
there
as
well
as
another
reviewer
noted
overall
not
bad
which
is
honestly
better
than
i
can
say
for
a
lot
of
their
beers
and
fairly
in
keeping
with
the
english
ipa
style
although
i
could
have
done
with
a
touch
more
hops
a
solid
brew
that
i
could
definitely
have
again
i
look
forward
to
trying
their
other
british
styles
and
hope
that
other
american
brewers
begin
following
in
pours
a
nice
slightly
hazy
orange
with
a
decent
frothy
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
some
biscuity
malts
and
mild
citrus
hops
taste
is
an
interesting
balance
of
sweet
malts
and
subtle
earthy
hops
just
a
little
on
the
watery
side
the
beer
is
crisp
and
light
with
low
carbonation
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
that
far
over
average
ive
had
other
beers
from
arcadia
that
have
been
very
good
not
sure
whats
going
on
here
worth
a
try
this
poured
a
dark
tan
with
tons
of
light
orange
head
it
smelled
like
mild
orange
hops
and
lots
of
sweet
malt
it
tasted
like
an
interesting
mix
of
citrus
hops
and
sugary
malt
it
was
watery
with
a
little
carbonation
and
a
solid
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
an
enjoyable
and
unique
flavor
nice
change
of
pace
for
an
ipa
whoa
pours
with
an
absolutely
huge
head
this
bottle
is
definitely
overcarbonated
a
few
minutes
later
the
foam
retreats
enough
for
me
to
get
my
nose
in
the
glass
of
this
light
orange
ale
lightly
flowery
aroma
buttery
on
the
palate
with
butterscotch
and
honey
hops
are
flowery
and
buried
under
the
butterscotch
flavor
heavy
carbonation
leaves
nice
lacing
halfway
through
not
bad
but
more
an
english
pale
ale
than
an
ipa
to
me
as
this
beer
seems
to
lack
the
powerful
bitter
finish
of
its
namesake
reminds
me
a
bit
of
fullers
london
special
but
with
more
restrained
hops
and
more
diacetyl
too
much
perhaps
some
age
on
this
one
i
had
the
arcadia
starboard
stout
earlier
and
prefer
that
to
this
one
have
to
give
this
one
low
marks
on
the
appearance
due
to
overcarbonation
d
very
nice
and
fresh
and
strong
hop
aroma
but
that
is
where
the
goodness
ends
for
me
the
hops
are
a
bit
out
of
balance
and
undermines
everything
else
that
might
have
been
in
this
beer
still
there
are
worse
ipas
out
there
than
this
one
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
good
session
beer
a
good
ipa
and
one
that
i
wont
avoid
but
one
that
would
be
vastly
improved
with
more
hops
without
question
i
had
a
few
pints
of
this
last
night
at
deks
american
in
rocky
point
ny
which
received
a
dry
hopped
cask
of
this
it
looked
good
in
an
orange
and
brown
way
and
the
aroma
was
getting
the
attention
of
the
hop
heads
in
our
crowd
the
grapefruit
and
lemon
twang
of
the
aroma
came
through
in
the
first
taste
which
had
a
slight
malt
character
to
it
the
taste
was
merely
plain
to
me
in
a
light
to
medium
body
it
took
three
pints
for
me
to
say
it
was
an
average
ale
and
the
reason
i
had
so
much
of
it
was
my
beer
group
sanctioned
the
event
of
the
cask
arrival
so
we
were
supporting
the
team
so
to
speak
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
c04
notched
on
the
side
whatever
that
means
brewed
with
english
2row
barley
and
pacific
nw
hops
it
pours
a
lightlyhazed
amber
with
high
carbonation
that
accumulates
three
fingers
of
almost
frothy
head
which
deposits
lots
of
lacing
as
i
drink
earthy
and
citric
in
the
aroma
nice
but
could
be
more
complex
tastes
of
citric
piney
earthy
and
lightly
spicy
hops
that
contribute
a
medium
bitterness
atop
lightly
toasted
malts
theres
a
touch
of
heat
in
there
as
well
the
body
is
medium
and
drying
with
a
fairly
long
finish
pretty
good
ipa
sessionable
for
sure
but
in
the
oversaturated
ipa
market
there
are
certainly
better
ones
out
there
d
a
different
tasting
ipa
for
me
but
i
did
enjoy
it
while
i
was
relaxing
and
catching
some
tv
would
recommend
for
someone
who
enjoys
a
wheat
beer
but
would
like
a
little
more
kick
pours
a
real
pretty
copper
color
with
a
huge
white
head
that
laces
all
the
way
down
its
really
pretty
the
smell
is
just
as
good
lots
of
piney
hops
dominate
the
nose
taste
is
pretty
good
has
a
nice
piney
hop
taste
to
it
has
a
strong
bitterness
to
it
almost
too
strong
mouthfeel
is
fine
and
so
is
the
drinkability
drinkability
is
low
to
moderate
tatse
is
pretty
average
good
solid
choice
for
an
ipa
pours
a
darker
amber
color
almost
a
copper
lots
of
foam
both
good
signs
for
an
ipa
imho
nice
aroma
can
pick
up
the
hops
slightly
floral
but
not
too
strong
nor
overwhelming
the
taste
is
this
brews
strong
point
strong
hops
excellent
aftertaste
no
sweetness
nor
noticeable
alcohol
burn
made
me
want
another
this
is
a
fine
ipa
with
a
welcoming
nod
to
its
origins
while
the
hops
dominate
they
are
not
overpowering
like
some
the
malt
is
also
on
the
low
side
providing
for
a
relatively
nice
balance
for
this
style
good
beer
overall
but
not
outstanding
going
to
finish
drinking
this
onebut
i
will
not
be
heading
back
out
to
the
store
to
get
any
more
i
would
expect
a
different
taste
and
a
lot
more
out
of
an
ipa
dnot
bad
i
could
have
a
few
d
a
good
middle
of
the
ipa
not
to
strong
and
very
clean
on
the
pallet
damn
just
as
i
barely
cracked
the
cap
on
this
beer
and
it
blasted
co2
all
over
it
didnt
overflow
at
all
but
it
took
a
long
time
to
pour
into
the
glass
the
body
is
a
nice
amber
color
with
an
as
mentioned
before
overwhelming
white
head
this
had
a
little
age
on
it
so
the
hops
were
probably
a
bit
subdued
from
their
fresh
state
there
was
just
a
hint
of
hop
aroma
left
the
flavor
had
a
lot
of
caramel
in
it
with
just
a
little
bittering
in
there
this
beer
is
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
hopmalt
scale
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
much
the
only
redeeming
quality
it
is
medium
bodied
and
it
works
well
if
this
wasnt
billed
as
an
ipa
i
would
have
rated
it
much
higher
sizable
cream
colored
head
tops
off
a
hazy
coppered
color
brew
fair
amount
of
lace
nice
floral
hop
scent
eminates
from
the
glass
backed
by
sweet
malt
taste
is
fronted
by
a
sweet
caramel
malt
but
is
dominated
by
a
nice
predominately
floral
malt
with
some
bitter
elements
as
well
nice
berry
tones
as
well
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
feel
pretty
solid
ipa
over
all
a
fairly
average
beer
not
awful
but
i
cant
say
ill
be
picking
this
ipa
up
again
any
time
soon
d
this
is
a
averageish
english
ipa
its
definitely
british
its
got
the
fresh
springtime
flower
garden
and
perfume
thing
going
on
and
it
lacks
the
american
citrus
and
pine
hop
flavors
i
think
that
this
is
a
good
brew
to
outline
the
difference
between
american
and
english
ipas
a
sidebyside
tasting
of
this
and
something
like
sierra
nevada
ipa
should
clear
up
any
confusion
between
us
and
the
brits
drank
easy
a
solid
eipa
that
i
could
session
on
no
problem
this
kinda
leaves
me
in
a
conundrum
because
this
is
a
decent
tasting
beer
if
it
were
sold
as
an
amber
id
probably
be
getting
a
little
more
excited
about
this
but
since
it
says
ipa
on
the
label
and
has
both
a
union
jack
and
a
tallship
on
itthats
enough
indicators
to
me
be
expecting
one
in
the
english
style
and
thats
not
what
i
got
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
murky
goldenorange
color
with
a
huge
frothy
cream
colored
head
the
smell
is
not
overwhelming
obviously
hoppy
citrus
but
also
slightly
sweet
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
not
overpowering
the
hoppiness
is
citrusy
slightly
piney
and
there
is
a
pretty
good
malt
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
frothy
carbonation
overall
a
drinkable
beer
and
while
it
isnt
an
extreme
ipa
it
is
well
done
and
enjoyable
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
went
very
nicely
with
hot
wings
pretty
drinkable
and
approachable
for
the
style
would
make
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
a
little
too
substantial
for
session
fare
but
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
knock
a
couple
of
these
back
a
nice
brew
that
i
will
remember
in
case
i
need
to
introduce
someone
to
the
style
or
feel
like
a
solid
apa
which
is
more
where
this
fits
in
my
opinion
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
mild
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
light
crystal
malts
the
hops
are
present
and
seem
to
give
off
a
grapefruity
aroma
along
with
a
fruity
yeast
element
the
taste
is
average
as
well
it
has
a
pale
and
light
crystal
malt
flavor
along
with
mild
hop
flavor
its
not
overly
bitter
but
the
yeasty
finish
spoils
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
ipa
its
true
to
the
english
style
although
its
not
a
very
good
representation
overall
a
drinkable
brew
but
doesnt
quite
fit
the
style
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
certainly
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
the
body
in
my
opinion
is
medium
with
just
a
bit
too
much
carbonationespecially
when
youve
got
that
large
head
in
front
of
your
nose
though
it
lessens
a
bit
as
the
head
gets
a
bit
smaller
finishes
semi
dry
leaving
a
spicy
hop
aftertaste
and
feel
in
the
back
of
your
throat
after
each
swallow
id
not
be
opposed
to
buying
this
beer
again
however
i
much
prefer
american
ipas
to
english
ones
and
even
more
so
id
not
come
back
to
this
brew
until
ive
sampled
some
more
of
the
english
varieties
drinkable
yes
but
it
doesnt
excite
me
like
other
ipas
in
fact
this
doesnt
really
seem
like
an
ipa
to
me
its
got
an
oldishtasting
malt
that
throws
me
off
its
not
bad
just
not
a
good
ipa
selection
pours
a
nice
slightly
cloudy
dark
golden
color
nice
carbonation
a
nice
twofinger
creamy
offwhite
head
lots
of
sticky
lacing
to
follow
the
nose
is
malty
hoppy
citrusy
slight
piney
and
some

the
taste
is
malty
hoppy
slighty
citrusypiney
some
caramel
with
almost
every
brew
ive
had
from
arcadia
there
seems
to
be
a
sour
note
thrown
in
in
some
brews
way
to
much
this
brew
has
a
slight
sourness
to
it
this
should
not
be
in
a
ipa
medium
body
drinkable
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
the
arcadia
brews
i
got
in
trade
so
far
a
bit
disappointed
ok
drinkability
but
not
something
id
crave
poured
a
hazy
amber
with
steady
visible
carbonation
and
good
head
development
smell
is
fairly
mild
with
a
spicy
hoppiness
more
akin
to
an
american
ipa
instead
of
the
english
style
taste
is
earthy
and
slightly
bitter
with
a
sour
offflavor
that
i
just
cant
place
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
and
somewhat
slick
drinkability
is
okay
but
i
wasnt
very
impressed
with
this
offering
i
find
that
arcadias
angler
pale
ale
is
a
better
choice
cheers
this
brew
poured
to
cloudy
amberdull
golden
color
with
a
pretty
good
sized
white
head
that
had
some
nice
retention
and
did
leave
a
good
amount
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
noticeable
hop
scent
mostly
citrus
with
a
light
but
sweat
malt
smell
but
also
has
a
slight
off
scent
that
i
can
not
put
my
finger
on
slightly
sour
the
taste
is
pretty
nice
a
lot
of
hops
are
noticeable
giving
it
a
grapefruit
like
favor
and
the
malts
are
there
as
well
but
somewhat
hidden
over
all
the
taste
of
this
brew
seems
to
be
better
than
the
scent
the
off
scent
that
i
continue
to
notice
does
not
translate
to
the
taste
over
all
this
is
a
afar
brew
just
think
that
there
are
many
more
english
and
american
ipas
out
there
that
i
would
grab
first
overall
i
didnt
really
care
for
this
one
it
had
a
bunch
of
strange
notes
to
it
d
decent
beer
not
hoppy
enough
for
an
ipa
d
nothing
too
shocking
here
easy
to
drink
but
not
spectacular
which
is
like
most
of
the
arcadia
beers
ive
tasted
mild
recommendation
there
is
a
light
to
medium
aroma
of
citrus
oil
leafiness
but
sweeter
smelling
than
most
ipas
the
flavor
is
slightly
grainy
at
first
with
only
a
minimal
amount
of
hop
bitterness
it
is
just
not
apparent
like
most
of
the
style
more
like
a
pale
ale
than
an
ipa
though
it
is
not
bad
wouldnt
go
outa
my
way
for
another
as
with
each
arcadia
brew
ive
had
this
has
a
very
english
character
throughout
the
aroma
and
flavor
it
is
very
nice
to
see
an
american
brewer
successfully
attempt
such
a
style
in
the
english
tradition
a
good
easy
to
drink
ipa
very
english
in
style
and
balance
nicely
done
overall
just
not
that
great
too
weak
is
all
aspects
thin
an
overall
lackluster
ipa
an
a
poorly
made
one
at
that
way
too
much
diacetylbutterscotch
zero
hop
aroma
or
flavor
im
glad
i
got
this
bottle
for
free
i
would
have
been
severly
disappointed
if
i
paid
for
it
even
getting
it
for
free
i
wouldnt
take
another
free
one
home
if
it
were
offered
dont
bother
pours
a
murky
copper
with
a
massive
rocky
head
and
thick
lacing
aroma
is
pleasant
blend
of
pine
and
grapefruit
with
an
offputting
dishsoap
smell
taste
is
grapefruit
and
pine
with
mild
malt
sweetness
very
dry
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
relatively
average
ipa
overall
a
disappointing
beer
from
arcadia
i
need
to
stop
trying
these
english
ipas
overall
this
is
a
great
english
style
ipa
the
classic
peach
flavors
are
there
soft
and
subdued
british
style
english
ipas
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
so
a
bit
of
a
skew
in
the
scoring
but
even
for
the
style
it
gets
strong
points
thick
and
bubbly
sticks
around
after
the
facst
but
doesnt
leave
a
film
or
anything
a
strong
flavorful
ipa
the
oak
does
a
nice
job
of
dulling
the
sharpness
of
the
hops
its
a
very
nice
beer
indeed
a
truly
average
beer
this
one
would
work
with
grilled
jumbo
shrimp
nothing
to
challenge
the
style
or
impress
the
tastebuds
you
wont
miss
much
if
you
skip
this
one
hazy
peach
with
a
formidable
offwhite
head
creamy
and
cratered
barrage
of
grapefruit
pith
in
the
nose
with
a
caramel
sweetness
lurking
underneath
bitter
and
citric
but
with
somewhat
watery
flavor
this
is
not
unpleasant
exactly
in
fact
its
sort
of
refreshing
but
it
still
subtracts
a
bit
from
the
overall
force
of
what
seems
to
have
been
conceived
as
a
tasty
hop
bill
weve
got
grapefruit
and
slight
spruce
notes
as
well
as
a
satisfying
biscuit
malt
finish
lovely
pine
burps
thinnish
juicy
mouthfeel
nothing
stellar
but
very
quenching
all
the
same
without
a
doubt
very
easy
to
drink

ipa
not
the
sort
of
ipa
to
blow
anyone
away
but
its
as
fine
an
example
of
a
solid
craft
brew
as
any
real
good
ipa
that
i
will
try
again
soon
its
not
a
great
one
but
a
nice
one
nevertheless
especially
if
you
are
looking
for
a
milder
easydrinking
ipa
with
enough
taste
to
be
satisfying
the
taste
is
creamy
with
a
mild
citrus
hop
flavor
that
is
very
drinkable
and
delicious
theres
not
much
spice
or
bitter
hopsmaking
this
very
drinkable
with
a
mf
thats
light
and
well
balanced
a
very
good
over
all
beer
that
could
be
an
everyday
lawnmower
brew
not
greatbut
very
drinkable
in
the
english
style
it
gives
off
a
good
floral
hops
aroma
and
a
slight
bit
of
orangishlemony
fragrances
tastes
extremely
fruity
a
bit
of
grapefuit
characteristic
here
it
finishes
with
a
slight
sweet
malt
flavor
this
starts
off
with
a
swift
kick
to
the
palate
and
finishes
moderately
warm
overall
a
good

from

biscuity

better
ask
the

about
this
one
poured
into

its
not

just
not
what
im
used
to
in
an

taste
is
nothing
like
the

weird
taste
is
floral

light
a
bit
of
coriander

herbal

mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
bit
on

im
feeling
very
middle
of

road
with

good

not
knockout
if
i
was
craving
hops
this
would
do
but
id
head
for

is
much
better
than
the

as
well

a
nonobtrusive

looks
like
it
should
be
past

but
the

not
the
packaging

according
to

altogether
mild

probably
better
when
its

tons

this
is
a
good

anyway
but
it
could
be
a
great
one
with
less
carbonation
this
bottle
sat
in
the
fridge
for
three
months
before
i
got
around
to
trying
it
so
i
should
get
a
fresher

that
it
will
have

more

bright

a
better

maybe
more
nectarine
than
orange
flavor
is
hops
with
a
great
sweetcitrus
hop
flavor
balanced
with
pine
my
first
thought
is
amarillo
hops
but
im
sure
they
use
columbus
in
this
really
nice
mouthfeel
is
good
could
maybe
use
just
a
touch
more
malt
to
support
the
hops
but
the
hops
are
not
intense
just
pure
slight
lack
of
balance
keep
it
from
being
really
drinkable
for
me
that
being
said
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
in
the
future
if
it
was
offered
to
me
i
just
may
not
buy
it
again
either
i
managed
to
drink
enough
to
properly
review
it
and
down
the
drain
she
goes
apparently
these
guys
have
some
bottling
issues
as
its
mentioned
by
a
lot
of
reviewers
for
shame
a
light
amber
color
with
a
half
inch
head
that
laces
nicely
along
the
glass
floral
piney
and
earthy
aromas
are
very
strong
the
scent
can
be
smelled
before
you
even
get
the
glass
to
your
nose
the
taste
hits
you
with
a
citrusy
grapefruit
flavor
but
has
a
nice
malt
flavor
at
the
end
to
finish
it
off
in
the
mouth
it
feels
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
bit
of
heaviness
towards
the
end
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
good
flavor
with
very
good
aroma
makes
this
an
excellent
pick
up
at
the
store
a
very
drinkable
ipa
definitely
an
english
style
ipa
not
an
american
hop
monster
very
true
to
style
very
tasty
worth
the
cost
of
a
sixer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
nicely
formed

that
has
decent
retention
just

but
well

medium
bodied
and
finished
dry
with
residual

flavors
a
good
standard
ipa
in
all
respects
drinkability
high
good
drinkability
but
i
wish
arcadia
would
do
something
about
the
overcarbonation
that
seems
so
prevalent
in
their
bottled
line
da
little
too
flowery
for
my
taste
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
other
hops
heads
might
find
it
more
enjoyable

the
beer
still
retained
an
impressive
twofinger
head
throughout
very
bright
fresh
hops
flavor
with
grapefruit
and
a
bit
of
resin
nice
malt
in
the
background
a
nicely
done
beer
and
if
this
were
more
available
to
me
i
can
see
it
showing
up
in
the
beerfridge
nice
clear
copper
color
perfect
2
finger
head
and
nice
lacing
smell
of
citrus
hops
leaning
toward
the
grapefruit
side
also
some
mild
spicyness
taste
is
not
as
bold
as
the
smell
again
mostly
citrus
hops
but
not
overpowering
in
the
least
a
little
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
finishes
dry
with
a
faint
bitter
aftertaste
an
ok
ipa
that
i
would
drink
if
offered
but
there
are
so
many
better
choices
out
there
that
i
doubt
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
chase
this
one
down
worth
a
try
if
you
are
in
battle
creek
and
want
to
stop
at
the
brewery
from
what
i
remember
this
tasted
much
better
fresh
from
the
tap
overall
its
a
decent
ipa
i
wouldnt
rush
out
to
find
it
in
the
stores
but
i
would
drink
it
if
it
was
available
a
nice
ipa
nice
that
they
shipped
to
nj
not
a
real
gotta
have
gotta
have

news
is
this
is
a
solid
example
of
an
english
ipa
the
only
thing
i
dont
like
about
it
is
how
all
six
bottles
in
the
six
pack
i
bought
were
over
primed
making
it
a
little
more
interesting
malts
were
typical
pale
and
caramel
aftertaste
was
a
little
to
metallic
and
mineralized
whoever
calls
english
style
ipas
nothing
but
glorified
bitters
is
right
on
the
money
with
this
beer

an
ipa
this
just
aint
cutting
it
for
me
puzzling
really
even
as
an
english
style
as
an
amber
this
could
be
something
worth
while
as
a
beer
to
drink
and
enjoy
its
still
a
bit
underwhelming
and
plain
though
likeable
high
to
medium
carbonation
for
a
british
style
it
provides
more
hops
than
one
would
expect
a
very
good
session
brew
like
straight
up
lemon
juice
taste
is
rahter
displeasing
flavors
are
bitter
and
hoppy
diacetyl
in
character
and
thickish
a
caramel
character
carries
through
with
fruity
rind
dripping
over
very
nice
ale
though
not
much
left
a
delicate
coating
of
fine
lacing

it
to
someone

endgame
if

given

some

very
bitter

this
is
over
the
top
which
is
good
advice
overall
a
quality
brew
for
those
who
appreciate
a
strong

presence
this
beer
is
quite
a
treat
its
very
difficult
to
find
a
good
englishstyle

in
this
area
special
thanks
to
my
little
sister
for
bringing
this
one
from
michigan
golden

and
forms
nice

meringue
peaks
on

of
large

fairly
well
carbonated
aroma
is
of

has
a

spiciness

a

sourness
and
what
is
that
bavarian

yeast
interesting
smells
quite
nice
gets
the
salivary
glands
working
overtime
taste
is
rough
around
the
edges
i
think
the
hopping
could
be
better
it
is
a
bit
more
hoppy
in
bitterness
than
in
flavor
and
the
finish
is
somewhat
astringent
basically
it
has
an
amateur
homebrew
taste
to
it
but
a
knockout
aroma
ill
stick
to
bells
twohearted
ale
my
favorite
ipa
a
very
enjoyable
ipa
not
as
good
as
a
bells
twohearted
or
victory
but
still
delicious
aroma
is
that
of
pine
and
grapefruit
with
a
nice
bitter
hop
presence
this
would
be
a
decent
session
ipa
as
it
is
easy
to
drink
golden
with
a
slight
orange
core
and
a
hazy
appearance
very
creamy
one
fingered
head
sits
on
top
smells
of
grapefruit
how
many
ways
can
i
describe
an
ipa
citrusy
grapefruit
taste
without
too
much
bitterness
not
the
beer
for
you
if
you
are
looking
for
a
very
bitter
ipa
it
is
the
2nd
best
bottled
ipa
from
michigan
that
i
can
recall
bells
two
hearted
gets
my
first
place
vote
part
of
and
arcadia
sampler
this
is
a
decent
ipa
but
really
doesnt
compare
to
some
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
lately
ruination
90
minute
etc
dark
murky
orangecopper
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
very
thin
lacing
aroma
was
somewhat
hoppy
are
those
fuggles
with
a
little
citrus
flavor
was
hoppy
with
a
light
malt
balance
and
a
light
toasty
finish
while
on
the
weak
side
there
was
really
nothing
offensive
going
on
here
this
would
probably
be
a
good
starter
ipa
buttery
and
hoppy
aroma
was
found
to
come
from
this
coppercolored
brew
it
was
solftly
carbonated
and
had
a
decent
head
fruity
hop
flavor
weighed
in
heavy
against
the
soft
malt
in
this
ipa
this
beer
had
a
hard
water
aftertaste
the
color
was
a
copperish
gold
but
the
head
was
small
due
to
how
they
poured
it
and
only
formed
a
small
white
head
with
not
lace
the
aroma
was
of
hops
and
slightly
of
citrus
the
flavor
was
malt
hops
with
a
hint
of
a
burnt
citrus
there
was
a
nice
hop
bitterness
to
the
finish
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
others
but
a
good
beer
hazy
marmalade
color
with
a
dense
ivory
head
that
drops
to
a
collar
but
leaves
some
good
lace
the
nose
displays
notes
of
fruitiness
and
lightly
sweet
malt
i
think
there
may
be
some
citrusy
hop
contributing
to
the
fruity
aroma
but
its
unclear
the
body
is
mediumlight
and
smooth
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
just
a
light
zest
on
the
tongue
this
beer
takes
a
turn
for
the
better
at
tasting
revealing
much
more
character
than
the
appearance
or
aroma
does
bright
hop
flavor
hits
the
tongue
first
mellowing
into
a
gently
fruity
malt
at
the
middle
and
finishing
with
an
agreeable
long
lasting
dryness
as
you
progress
through
the
tasting
the
malt
and
hop
flavors
trade
places
playing
off
each
other
always
complimentary
not
a
big
or
complex
i
p
a
but
one
with
a
great
balance
and
interplay
of
flavors
this
ipa
has
a
prominent
grassy
grapefruit
aroma
and
mellow
pale
golden
color
subtle
butter
flavor
and
a
strong
but
smooth
bitter
quality
round
off
a
nice
representation
overall
a
pretty
good
english
ipa
not
my
favorite
and
the
aroma
was
seriously
lacking
but
if
it
was
on
tap
with
the
macros
id
pick
this
instead
this
is
a
nasty
malt
bomb
i
dont
know
if
the
bottle
was
sitting
in
the
shelf
for
2
years
before
i
got
it
but
it
was
a
drain
pour
just
being
honest
o
a
good
traditional
english
ipa
so
dont
come
expecting
a
west
coast
hop
bomb
one
day
id
like
to
visit
and
try
this
on
tap
im
not
usually
and
english
ipa
guy
but
this
is
up
there
with
the
ones
i
like
best
berkshire
lost
sailer
comes
to
mind
i
think
i
prefer
american
brewers
brewing
engilsh
ipas
just
like
i
like
billie
joe
imitating
an
englishman
imitating
an
american
better
than
a
british
accent
yup
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
slightly
bitter
for
my
taste
but
those
who
are
all
about
the
ibus
will
like
this
one
i
have
tried
this
one
in
a
bottle
as
well
as
ontap
and
although
the
bottle
is
just
fine
this
is
one
with
subtleties
that
come
off
much
better
ontap
come
on
over
to
trinity
during
a
quiet
afternoon
play
chess
with
a
friend
take
your
time
with
a
couple
of
pints
of
this
and
savor
away
the
hop
profile
in
this
is
quite
odd
its
not
a
blast
of
bitter
citrus
like
most
american
ipas
its
more
herbal
earthy
and
grassy
but
it
packs
a
bitter
punch
ive
been
meaning
to
try
beers
from
trinity
for
a
while
and
this
was
not
a
bad
choice
overall
this
is
a
great
ipa
i
really
liked
it
i
just
wish
it
had
a
high
malt
to
hop
ratio
i
like
my
ipas
with
a
bigger
malt
presence
it
was
a
flavorful
hop
bomb
for
sure
if
i
ever
am
in
the
mood
for
a
big
ipa
and
happen
to
see
this
in
southern
new
england
or
in
rhode
island
ill
get
it
no
problem
overall
a
very
flavorful
ipa
big
hop
aroma
and
flavor
but
not
much
malt
to
balance
it
good
overall
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
it
isnt
a
standout
ipa
that
ill
be
tracking
down
overall
a
nice
ipa
notes
this
is
quite
hoppy
for
an
english
i
p
a
but
still
tasty
all
over
cheers
o
dangerously
drinkable
fail
overall
not
bad
the
hops
were
pretty
good
and
didnt
get
that
herbal
hedgerow
bittering
hops
i
dont
like
they
were
decent
grassy
and
earthy
hops
little
juicy
and
spicy
nice
malts
to
back
it
up
a
bit
a
nice
ale
flavor
but
the
yeast
seems
to
change
it
a
bit
o
just
noticing
now
that
its
7
wouldnt
have
noticed
from
the
aroma
or
taste
they
blend
it
well
i
would
have
guessed
5
maybe
6
max
given
that
and
the
astringency
i
dont
think
id
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
ive
had
this
beer
at
trinity
ontap
and
remember
it
being
tastier
than
this
bottled
version
drinks
okay
not
something
id
buy
by
the
six
pack
but
not
something
im
about
to
pour
down
the
drain
either
just
meh
all
in
all
this
is
so
dry
that
it
seems
to
take
away
from
the
brew
an
earthy
hoppy
metallic
type
dry
not
really
worth
hunting
but
if
you
like
trinity
give
it
a
try
when
youre
at
the
brewhouse
many
better
ipas
pours
a
nice
pale

1
finger

smells
of
bountiful
floral
bouquets
with
citrusy
and
piny
resin
aromas
taste
isnt
quite
on
par
with
smell
has
the
herbal
and
floral
for
sure
but
also
a
faint
bitterness
that
is
very
well
balanced
that
wasnt
detectable
in
the
nose
feels
very
smooth
going
down
crispy
with
the
mild
bitter
finish
again
very
well
balanced
this
brew
is
very
drinkable
crisp
and
refreshing
sure
to
satisfy
on
a
hot
day
had
this
while
i
was
cooking
up
a
dinner
with
copious
amounts
of
garlic
and
spiciness
and
it
went
very
well
with
the
few
bites
i
had
as
i
was
cooking
away
nothing
too
overpowering
bitterness
was
balanced
by
floral
and
fruitiness
overall
nothing
that
blew
me
away
but
nothing
terribly
disappointing

thanks
mark
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
copper
color
with
a
nice
ecru
froth
to
top
it
all
off
the
aroma
is
much
more
caramel
based
than
most
ipas
im
used
to
oh
this
is
an
eipa
that
would
explain
that
the
aroma
given
off
is
most
similar
to
an
orange
marmalade
with
some
sugary
sweet
fruit
notes
to
go
along
with
the
malt
base
the
flavor
is
still
plenty
bitter
from
the
hops
but
has
a
nice
brown
sugar
flavor
with
the
orange
citrus
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
on
the
dry
side
for
my
liking
but
its
not
unpalatable
there
is
nothing
special
or
outstanding
about
this
beer
but
it
is
overall
a
quality
brew
thin
mouthfeel
and
a
moderatehigh
carbonation
for
the
style
pretty
solid
its
butteryness
was
a
problem
but
it
didnt
completely
distract
me
from
the
beer
possibly
a
problem
with
the
yeast
not
cleaning
up
all
the
diacetyl
after
fermentation
but
who
knows
didnt
realize
this
was
7
thats
funny
why
is
it
so
high
d
a
hearty
malty
ipa
that
holds
together
very
well
wellbalanced
and
a
good
departure
from
my
usual
goto
hopbombs
probably
a
bit
too
rich
and
filling
to
squash
too
many
in
one
sitting
i
tend
to
criminally
overlook
this
solid
ipa
probably
because
its
so
common
in
these
parts
but
it
grows
on
me
a
little
bit
more
each
time
i
try
it
not
quite
in
my
list
of
alltime
favorite
ipas
but
always
a
good
choice
drinkability
is
ok
this
isnt
a
bad
ipa
but
its
not
a
great
one
either
kind
of
average
d
a
pretty
good
english
ipa
and
one
might
argue
dangerously
drinkable
at
7
abv
the
strength
of
the
brew
is
not
measured
by
its
alcohol
flavor
but
rather
the
hop
content
mellow
enough
to
have
a
couple
but
not
the
most
exciting
or
balanced
english
ipa
you
could
probably
find
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
begins
as
citrus
but
then
gets
a
strong
buttery
popcorn
note
the
flavor
is
also
dominated
by
butter
with
only
the
slightest
hint

cloudy
orangeish
color
with
a
4
finger
head
that
is
a
creamy
thick
white
color
that
is
sticking
around
for
awhile
the
smell
is
floral
and
citrisey
hops
and
fresh
baking
breed
the
first
drink
is
ritch
breedy
malt
up
front
then
floral
hops
in
the
midle
and
a
lingering
piney
hop
bite
that
leaves
a
plesent
after
taste
that
wont
go
away
as
it
warms
the
beer
gets
slighty
sweeter
and
the
piney
flavor
is
still
strong
but
gets
i
tuch
more
citrusey
this
is
a
beer
i
would
drink
often
if
it
were
avalable
hear
d
this
was
a
very
drinkable
ipa
that
i
enjoyed
a
growler
of
actually
i
split
it
with
some
friends
and
we
all
had
no
problem
drinking
it
at
all
will
look
to
try
this
from
the
bottle
to
see
what
the
difference
is
a
good
drinking
east
coast
ipa
for
sure
this
beer
pours
with
a
nice
ipa
style
color
this
beer
has
a
good
ipa
smell
has
a
small
amount
of
sweetness
which
i
enjoy
in
an
ipa
this
is
an
above
average
ipa
and
i
look
forward
to
consuming
another
trinity
ipa
when
i
make
it
back
up
to
this
region
dthis
is
a
pretty
easy
to
drink
ipa
with
a
lot
of
balance
a
definite
malt
presence
in
this
beer
but
it
still
leans
towards
the
hops
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
d
a
more
intense
beer
in
the
growler
than
in
the
bottle
i
really
liked
this
its
a
shame
ive
slept
on
this
for
so
long
i
see
myself
picking
up
a
growler
on
a
pretty
frequent
basis
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
the
bottle
version
medium
carbonation
and
sweet
but
still
pretty
light
and
drinkable
so
well
balanced
that
i
feel
like
i
could
go
for
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
quite
hoppy
but
the
alpha
acids
arent
overwhelming
which
makes
for
a
really
nice
drink

pleasingly

ipa
the

are
smooth

soft

quite
noticable
enjoyable
understated
and
well

nothing
earth
shattering

worth
a
try
would
work
quite
well
as
an
all
night
sessioner
a
12

the

a

a

not

appealing

drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
on
the
thin
side
of
medium

the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
this
beer
isnt
a
hop
bomb
and
wasnt
meant
to
be
one
either
i
think
the
brewer
tried
for
and
achieved
a
very
well
balanced
ipa
just
an
excellent
treat
this
beer
pours
a
deep
clear
amberbrown
color
with
a
2
finger
of

that
fades
to
a

relatively
quickly
some
thin
wispy

is
left
on

is
of
sweet
caramel

and
a
healthy
dose
of
floral

and
a
hint
of
some
citrus

taste
is
of
caramel
malts
upfront
possibly
some
molasses
hops
presence
hits
in
the
middle
to
end
nice
rich
floral
hops
and
a
piney
character
that
i
didnt
detect
in

finish
has
a
citrus
hops
bite
to
it
medium
body
medium
carbonation
nice
clean
taste
to
it
with
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
great
one
to
sit
with
though
the
abv
sneaks
up
on
you
it
is
also
extremely
delicious
when
they
have
it
on
cask
even
smoother
and
more
complex
pours
an
opaque
copper
with
a
very
nice
head
and
lacing
smell
is
a
nice
blast
of
citrus
hops
with
a
veiled
malt
presence
taste
is
a
bitter
hop
blast
not
much
balance
on
the
malt
side
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
suffer
a
tad
from
the
overly
bitter
quality
of
the
hops
needs
just
a
tad
more
smoothness
drinkability
other
than
the
finish
i
rather
liked
this
beer
too
bade
avout
the
aftertaste
not
my
kind
of
ipa
but
a
good
offering
if
youre
into
the
bitter
kinds
as
opposed
to
the
citrus
kinds
i
especially
like
the
way
the
malt
gives
you
just
enough
sweetness
probably
a
favorite
englishstyle
ipa
ive
ever
had
d
nothing
mindblowing
a
good
session
ipa
and
probably
a
pretty
good
value
trinity
offers
a
great
selection
at
the
brewhouse
and
this
is
one
of
their
best
unfortunately
this
beer
is
not
the
same
in
the
bottle
as
it
is
at
trinity
brewhouse
it
is
a
very
very
hopyy
and
bitter
ipa
really
hits
you
in
the
face
with
the
smell
and
taste
of
hops
if
you
like
ipas
this
is
a
good
one
but
try
it
at
the
brewhouse
decided
to
have
this
with
an
nice
pasta
dinner
and
garlic
bread
a
nice
amber
brew
with
a
solid
white
head
greats
me
a
nice
citric
herbal
hop
note
balanced
by
a
bready
maltiness
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
bitterness
which
cuts
through
dinner
nicely
medium
bodied
nicely
carbonated
with
a
nice
residual
bitter
note
and
a
clean
finish
a
very
hoppy
to
my
palate
ipa
drinkability
this
one
is
a
personal
favorite
so
if
the
rating
seems
too
high
too
bad
haha
this
is
a
great
ipa
and
more
than
deserving
of
a
great
review
strongly
recommend
it
trinity
ipa
is
a
rocksolid
english
ipa
brewed
by
new
englanders
even
though
i
prefer
the
flavor
of
american
hops
a
change
of
pace
is
always
good
if
it
was
available
locally
id
be
down
for
a
sixer
right
here
and
now
no
questions
asked
m
d
lighter
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
oiliness
fairly
straight
forward
a
little
heavy
in
alcohol
content
so
a
bit
easy
going
not
too
shabby
but
there
are
some
other
options
i
would
lean
towards
more
drinkability
an
interesting
beer
and
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
its
a
solid
english
ipa
not
my
favorite
style
with
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
and
a
decent
array
of
tastes
and
aromas
alcohol
is
gettin
up
there
for
the
style
however
though
theres
no
sign
of
it
which
is
nice
good
to
have
a
nice
local
blue
state
beer
too
cheers
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
chimay
chalice
the
beer
pours
a
reddish
amber
with
a
1
inch
head
that
seriously
lacked
staying
power
while
the
head
receded
quickly
it
did
leave
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
overwhelmingly
malty
there
is
almost
no
hint
of
hops
just
a
small
aroma
of
citrus
at
the
end
of
the
nose
the
aroma
is
grainy
with
just
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
the
taste
follows
suit
with
malt
being
the
dominant
flavor
with
just
a
mild
nondescript
bitterness
at
the
tail
of
the
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
mild
carbonation
this
beer
reminds
me
of
what
you
get
at
local
restaurants
that
just
happen
to
make
a
couple
styles
of
beer
in
house
nothing
exciting
but
nothing
horrible
either
just
average
all
across
the
board
no
surprises
here
a
steadyeddie
sessionable
ipa
their
brewpub
across
from
the
dunk
in
providence
is
also
a
good
place
to
hit
before
baby
bs
games
in
the
wintertime
hmm
i
thought
this
was
pretty
decent
other
reviewers
obviously
not
so
much
trinity
needs
to
work
on
this
ipa
it
primarily
needs
less
malt
and
more
hops
that
would
be
a
huge
stip
in
the
right
direction
as
it
is
its
just
very
average
not
one
i
would
suggest
seeking
out
d
nice
ale
for
a
warm
rhode
island
summer
day
but
would
be
best
with
some
hot
steamers
d
not
good
very
poorly
balanced
with
no
malt
support
poor
sessionability
not
much
to
this
ipa
a
bit
watery
and
not
much
in
the
flavor
i
tried
it
but
wont
seek
it
out
again
if
it
was
for
free
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
though
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
tad
unbalanced
the
appearance
is
quite
good
it
pours
a
tawny
amber
with
a
slight
creamy
head
a
bit
of
lacing
and
some
retention
the
aroma
is
pretty
typical
of
a
mainline
ipa
there
are
some
grassy
hops
a
touch
of
malt
in
the
background
the
aroma
is
not
of
the
oily
estery
hop
character
and
the
same
goes
for
the
taste
there
is
a
pretty
upfront
hoppy
bitter
taste
but
it
is
more
dryish
a
bit
tea
like
perhaps
a
bit
grassy
but
it
does
lack
that
oily
and
estery
hoppiness
that
i
prefer
you
will
get
some
grapefruit
like
astringency
coupled
with
the
bitterness
the
result
is
a
overly
bitter
beer
with
not
enough
biscuity
malts
in
the
backbone
to
balance
it
out
there
is
also
too
much
of
a
bittering
aftertaste
not
a
bad
beer
quite
refreshing
with
some
carbonation
fairly
light
to
medium
bodied
worth
giving
a
try
i
would
very
much
like
to
visit
the
brewpub
and
have
this
on
tap
pretty
good
entry
for
an
ipa
i
was
surprised
by
the
big
hop
flavor
in
this
brew
it
has
been
years
since
i
tried
this
at
the
brewpub
but
i
recall
the
inhouse
version
being
a
bit
more
tame
a
solid
hoppy
ipa
d
this
is
a
solid
standard
ipa
its
got
a
nice
kick
with
a
great
balance
pretty
well
done
overall
with
taps
at
the
ready
a
very
knowledgeable
brewer
prepared
my
beer
with
a
noticeable
head
that
cascaded
around
as
he
turned
the
pint
slightly
in
drought
the
distinct
aroma
of
pine
with
citrus
hoppy
foam
was
my
first
sensory
pleasure
at
first
sip
its
head
grasped
my
upper
lip
with
a
very
light
rose
scent
the
7
abv
isnt
noticeable
which
has
its
drawbacks
after
68
you
thank
the
beer
gods
that
you
are
within
walking
distance
of
the
train
in
downtown
providence
it
is
one
of
the
better
ipas
that
i
have
encountered
in
a
brewpub
overall
this
was
a
quality
little
ipa
that
i
had
never
heard
of
but
impressed
me
none
the
less
it
was
just
put
together
well
not
overally
explosive
on
teh
hops
and
just
well
nice
i
would
definatly
not
turn
this
one
down
i
wanted
to
like
this
and
the
ingredients
are
actually
good
you
can
sense
that
underneath
but
the
blending
or
what
there
is
of
it
is
inept
and
unbalanced
and
with
an
abv
that
plays
a
lot
bigger
than
it
actually
is
its
one
more
distraction
and
an
obstacle
to
drinking
more
easily
i
doubt
ill
run
across
this
again
and
the
shame
is
thats
okay
very
drinkable
good
hop
flavor
without
an
over
the
top
abv
only
complaint
is
the
mouthfeel
the
lack
of
body
and
xs
carbonation
dont
do
this
beer
any
favors
overall
a
good
and
drinkable
ale
closer
to
an
eipa
in
my
opinion
based
on
the
hop
profile
pours
a
murky
caramel
brown
reddish
highlights
huge
off
white
head
lots
of
sticky
lace
good
retention
never
wants
to
go
away
smell
is
lots
of
sweet
malts
caramel
pine
some
citrus
bit
of
floral
lots
of
fruit
not
too
hoppy
pretty
balanced
taste
is
weak
some
grain
caramel
pine
bit
of
citrus
kind
of
medicinal
in
the
finish
nutty
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
low
possibly
lower
than
normal
due
to
a
bad
seal
still
seems
to
be
in
shape
judging
by
previous
reviews
just
not
entirely
interesting
thanks
for
the
brew
mark
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
at
trinity
and
the
one
time
they
actually
had
it
on
cask
it
was
probably
the
single
best
single
ipa
i
have
ever
had
its
ok
in
the
bottle
too
but
to
get
the
real
experience
head
to
the
brewhouse
the
flavor
is
concentrated
and
direct
combining
malt
hops
and
yeast
into
one
solid
flavor
the
somewhat
sweetish
malt
is
darkly
caramelish
and
balanced
by
a
bold
bitterness
yeasty
fruitiness
adds
a
fresh
sweetish
accent
thats
reminicent
of
apples
berries
pear
and
cherry
the
citrusy
hops
round
it
out
but
are
more
restrained
than
might
be
expected
helping
to
focus
on
the
whole
rather
than
just
the
hop
component
and
yet
theres
still
enough
there
to
allow
each
component
its
own
berth
and
enough
depth
of
character
to
give
it
some
complexity
and
drinkability
additionally
some
actual
yeast
flavor
sneaks
in
giving
it
another
dimension
although
a
more
careful
pour
might
help
to
hold
that
back
nicely
done
a
bright
lively
ipa
that
wakens
the
tastebuds
certainly
worth
trying
in
the
2007
beer
super
bowl
o
beer
a
lot
better
than
my
previous
experience
with
trinity
ipa
which
was
almost
2
years
ago
i
remember
it
having
a
very
metallic
taste
to
it
which
wasnt
present
this
time
around
although
the
overflowing
head
problem
was
pretty
annoying
d
i
wouldnt
refuse
another
one
but
i
also
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
ipa
good
appearance
and
smell
but
with
flawed
taste
and
mouthfeel
make
this
a
worth
a
try
beer
at
best
a
nice
pick
up
on
the
way
back
from
ct
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
very
little
in
the
way
of
head
or
lacing
which
is
somewhat
surprising
considering
the
alcohol
content
in
any
event
from
the
first
smell
this
was
going
to
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
sweet
malty
flavor
clung
to
the
front
while
there
was
just
a
waft
of
hops
lingering
about
the
edges
of
my
nostrils
just
a
tad
bit
of
fruitiness
could
be
detected
with
a
deep
inhalation
the
taste
mimicked
the
nose
with
that
malty
fruity
flavor
upfront
as
the
beer
slid
down
the
back
of
my
tongue
and
onto
my
throat
the
hops
became
detectable
this
is
definitely
a
nice
balance
between
the
hoppiness
that
is
more
prevalent
with
american
ipas
with
a
nice
smooth
maltiness
of
the
english
style
i
could
easily
drink
4
or
5
of
these
without
any
trouble
a
good
choice
for
a
sixer
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
thanks
themaniacalone
for
the
chance
to
try
this
brew
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
has
a
sweet
malt
piney
hops
some
honey
taste
is
some
malt
hop
bitterness
citrus
kind
of
dry
not
a
bad
drinking
beer
but
nothing
to
wait
on
d
tasty
due
to
the
good
hops
kick
nottoofilling
seems
to
lean
toward
an
englishstyle
ipa
with
some
extra
hoppiness
i
thought
this
beer
would
taste
similar
to
their
rhode
island
ipa
that
they
have
ontap
at
the
brewpub
however
although
it
was
still
good
the
two
beers
are
quite
different
even
when
you
factor
in
the
bottle
vs
tap
a
toned
down
ipa
in
some
respects
the
hop
character
is
slow
acting
which
is
pretty
unusual
a
change
of
pace
but
i
prefer
the
more
modern
aggressive
hop
monsters
hazy
apricot
colored
with
a
huge
inchhigh
head
of
light
orange
foam
bubbles
are
small
and
fine
contributing
to
a
thick
meringue
feel
aroma
is
light
but
malty
a
little
grainy
not
too
hoppy
perhaps
because
the
foam
holds
it
down
flavor
is
initially
piney
hops
with
specks
of
grapefruit
and
tangerine
followed
by
a
faint
malt
presence
also
some
bits
of
metallic
flavor
which
detract
good
mouthfeel
but
average
drinkability
because
its
not
very
complex
or
multidimensional
nice

or
earthy
scent
to
it
subtle
maltiness
in
the
background
rather
strong
had
a
good
taste
to
it
but
very
bubbly
like
an
ipa
momosa
besides
the
over
carbination
it
was
a
decent
beer
on
tap
is
much
better
at
trinity
brewhouse
this
sixer
did
this
beer
no
justice
once
the
bubbles
are
managed
then
i
will
seek
a
rematch
better
on
tap
at
trinity
great
mouthfeel
with
good
hop
flavor
poured
in
the
glass
nicely
with
a
little
head
that
receded
to
a
lacy
overcoating
standard
coloring
for
its
style
would
like
a
bit
more
hop
smell
not
enough
compared
to
what
youre
tasting
tastes
a
tad
too
bitter
for
me
would
like
more
hop
flavor
with
the
bitterness
but
this
could
just
be
me
great
mouthfeel
did
i
already
say
that
and
good
hop
lingering
after
taste
leaves
your
palate
thirsting
for
more
m
d
mouthfeel
is
of
pure
carbonation
a
bit
oily
at
the
sides
of
the
mouth
with
a
good
bitter
ending
suprisingly
drinkable
even
though
you
have
to
wait
for
the
big
ass
head
to
dissipate
very
tasty
ipa
that
id
like
to
try
on
tap
instead
of
in
the
bottle
as
the
carbonation
would
most
likely
be
less
as
my
review
states
this
is
just
an
overall
average
beer
it
is
however
much
better
than
the
first
batch
of
trinity
that
was
brewed
by
cottrell
that
stuff
was
pure
swill
not
an
overly
hoppy
ipa
and
pretty
bland
taste
however
it
still
was
pretty
good
overall
i
would
like
to
try
some
directly
from
the
brewery
to
see
the
difference
id
had
their
ipa
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
several
times
and
it
was
always
always
much
better
than
this
im
guessing
theres
some
quality
issues
on
the
production
level
for
one
losing
at
least
some
of
the
yeasty
flavor
and
perhaps
some
actual
yeast
may
improve
both
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
also
perhaps
the
bottling
line
is
failing
to
remove
enough
oxygen
from
the
bottles
prior
to
capping
not
letting
them
foam
up
enough
before
capping
the
frothing
of
the
head
the
cardboard
flavor
and
the
huge
amount
of
carbonation
are
all
things
i
expect
in
an
old
oxodized
bottle
of
beer
if
id
bought
this
at
a
less
than
reputable
shop
id
chalk
it
up
to
just
sitting
there
since
last
year
but
i
have
enough
faith
in
the
store
to
assume
the
problem
was
in
the
bottling
i
mean
the
beers
nice
enough
as
it
is
drinkable
in
small
quantity
but
it
could
be
so
much
better
fix
the
problems
and
you
have
a
real
winner
im
unsure
if
i
had
a
bad
6pack
of
this
but
the
beer
was
way
overcarbonated
the
head
filled
the
entire
glass
after
a
while
of
waiting
it
did
hold
a
nice
lacy
layer
over
the
beer
which
is
always
nice
the
color
was
that
of
a
foggy
amberbrownish
look
very
aromatic
with
much
hops
and
a
hint
of
sweetnessfruit
the
mouthfeel
was
very
carbonated
with
a
nice
piny
flavor
which
turned
slightly
sweet
and
ended
with
a
long
finish
very
enjoyable
if
the
carbonation
was
less
lots
o
hops
but
somewhat
unbalanced
if
you
ask
me
needs
more
of
a
malt
presence
to
back
up
the
bitter
not
terribly
bad
but
not
too
far
above
average
either
i
was
pretty
suprised
i
dont
know
why
at
the
great
apearance
smell
and
taste
of
this
ipa
it
is
better
than
i
expected
decently
full
of
hops
and
great
looking
worth
a
try
notes
the
brits
may
have
done
it
first
but
i
dont
think
they
do
it
best
this
however
is
a
very
nice
example
of
what
an
ipa
can
be
great
looking
beer
lots
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
very
british
in
the
style
loads
of
earthy
grassy
hops
medium
high
bitterness
with
excellent
drinkability
i
prefer
american
hops
but
it
is
certainly
a
great
beer
o
really
nice
brew
found
in
kunming
and
drank
here
january
20th
2014
will
let
it
warm
a
little
and
see
how
it
does
with
burger
king
o
date
on
bottle
is
6914
not
sure
if
thats
the
bottling
date
or
best
by
date
either
way
its
old
and
may
have
lost
its
hop
profile
would
recommend
and
would
buy
again

not

goes
down

good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
if
you
want
an
ipa
with
less
of
an
edge
than
most
overall
for
an
eipa
this
is
probably
the
best
one
that
i
have
had
so
far
hoppy
herbal
malty
and
delicious
p
s
my

label
mentioned
a

not
7
5
as
mentioned
in
the
description
above
overall
drinkability
for
the
price
of
a
small
bottle
not
something
i
would
buy
again
good
but
not
amazing
however
if
it
were
on
cask
in
the
uk
at
a
lower
price
i
think
i
would
definitely
have
another
a
beer
for
savoring
and
all
the
flavors
come
out
at
proper
british
beer
temperatures
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
to
get
the
aromas
and
tastes
so
a
good
beer
overall
but
rather
expensive
to
have
often
or
to
drink
a
lot
of
overall
a
pretty
decent
english
ipa
from
a
good
brewery
in
england
i
would
really
like
to
try
some
more
of
this
brewerys
beers
o
im
sure
its
well
made
but
im
really
not
keen
on
it
theres
no
way
i
could
finish
a
bottle
to
myself
o
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
to
the
style
but
it
isnt
really
for
me
ill
have
to
try
their
other
beers
available
in
my
area
appears
bright
flowing
tangerine
with
a
chunky
textured
off
white
head
fine
bands
of
even
lacing
grace
my
chalice
aroma
has
bright
orange
citrus
notes
with
mango
tropical
fruit
based
hops
earthy
yeast
notes
with
pure
liquid
bread
malt
layers
flavor
is
well
meshed
subdued
hop
bitterness
with
complex
malt
base
orange
fruit
acidity
from
the
alpha
acids
complement
each
other
so
well
perfect
hybrid
aggressive
hop
flavors
with
complex
malts
still
quite
english
in
nature
this
is
a
must
try
ipa
from
across
the
pond
mouthfeel
is
delicate
resinous
and
naturally
carbonated
great
stuff
cheers
for
sure
i
appreciate
the
smaller
bottles
beautiful
tear
drop
design
great
stuff
overall
ive
spoke
my
peace
best
english
ipa
ive
come
across
now
go
find
some
o
i
have
long
admired
meantimes
desire
to
both
innovate
and
faithfully
recreate
the
styles
of
the
past
but
that
being
said
their
actual
beers
are
normally
hit
or
miss
for
me
this
ipa
is
not
bad
but
it
is
somewhat
harsh
overly
brash
and
aggressive
it
is
definitely
not
the
most
drinkable
example
of
the
style
it
does
however
display
a
commendable
complexity
and
is
solidly
crafted
i
would
recommend
this
ale
to
fans
of
stronger
british
ales
especially
those
who
fancy
themselves
eipa
connoisseurs
could
use
more
carbonation
quite
hoppy
but
not
overly
bitter
and
with
a
solid
caramel
and
sweet
malt
base
that
was
very
enjoyable
i
find
it
hard
to
rate
styles
i
find
boring
and
this
ones
a
boring
example
of
a
boring
stye
im
board
now
for
sure
time
to
go
fire
off
bottle
rockets
towards
the
seniors
home
across
the
street
tastetoasted
malttoffee
caramel
mineral
note
all
just
barely
balanced
by
a
good
dose
of
noble
hops
and
whitegrapefruit
rind
bitterness
a
classic
english
ipa
that
begs
for
a
spicy
food
pairing
indian
thai
or
maybe
just
a
hunk
of
aged
white
cheddar
a
quite
tasty
english
ale
one
which
i
would
have
much
more
ease
believing
if
you
told
me
it
was
a
heppedup
esb
rather
than
another
rendition
of
were
not
an
american
band
ipa
give
it
a
rest
anyways
a
rather
sexy
bitter
ale
with
a
grand
ol
bit
of
warming
sass
sans
the
typical
flavour
consequences
one
of
the
odd
examples
of
an
english
ipa
that
tastes
more
like
an
american
ipa
usually
its
the
other
way
around
but
this
one
is
hop
heavy
without
all
the
caramel
malt
sweetness
the
pour
has
a
nice
reddish
color
to
it
fairly
hazy
with
a
few
fingers
of
lasting
khaki
foam
the
nose
is
big
bold
woody
oily
american
hops
centennial
maybe
maybe
something
else
high
alpha
but
this
has
a
real
hop
forwardness
to
it
the
malts
arent
really
sweet
at
all
just
biscuity
in
a
supporting
role
the
flavor
agrees
with
the
smell
hops
all
the
way
there
is
a
nice
citrus
element
to
it
orange
peel
and
a
lot
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
taste
but
you
can
certainly
feel
a
big
bottle
of
this
the
yeast
imparts
an
almost
belgian
brightness
to
the
mouthfeel
its
effervescently
carbonated
which
is
nice
in
a
big
ipa
for
once
and
the
body
is
fuller
than
medium
but
not
filling
or
weighty
overall
this
is
an
exemplary
beer
a
whole
lot
better
than
meantimes
coffee
porter
and
one
thats
actually
pretty
fairly
priced
at
under
13
bucks
for
a
750ml
its
worth
all
of
that
a
real
treat
where
i
honestly
least
expected
it
one
of
the
best
ipas
i
can
remember
tasting
richness
and
depth
of
malty
flavour
with
the
bundles
of
happy
hoppiness
youd
expect
feels
like
a
real
treat
pretty
strong
but
the
alcohol
is
beautifully
disguised
o
purdy
good
purdy
unrefined
in
a
positive
manner
malty
like
a
helles
and
quite
orangeflavored
the
bitterness
is
soft
but
on
the
high
side
for
a
uk
version
would
be
interested
in
having
again
hopefully
more
fresh
well
balanced
beer
considering
the
style
and
it
has
a
very
good
drinkability
traditional
english
ipa
with
less
character
in
comparison
to
the
us
counterparties
though
still
above
average
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the

down
smell
is
of

citrus
fruit
and
citrus
zest
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
a
seriously
excellent
uk
ipa
fruity
and
dry
zesty
and
sharp
but
without
all
the
skinflaying
harshness
found
in
so
many
american
models
even
my
wife
everhesitant
toward
ipas
as
a
class
enjoyed
it
and
you
wont
need
to

overall
this
is
a
highly
excellent
english
ipa
extremely
well
balanced
with
good
complexity
very
smooth
to
drink
highly
enjoyable
stuff
this
was
a
change
of
pace
from
my
usual
ipa
haunts
and
i
liked
it
nothing
over
the
top
or
knocking
your
socks
off
but
i
felt
completely
satisfied
with
it
at
the
end
of
the
glass
one
other
thing
to
note
was
the
bottle
design
with
narrow
neck
and
much
wider
base
it
certainly
is
visually
attractive
compared
to
the
usual
beer
bottle
a
few
nonbeer
drinkers
told
me
as
much
when
they
saw
it
but
more
than
two
of
them
would
start
taking
up
a
fair
bit
more
floor
space
in
your
fridge
than
standard
bottles
or
cans
overall
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
it
doesnt
look
pretty
but
has
a
lot
of
bitterness
but
a
nice
malt
backbone
to
balance
it
floral
english
hops
can
be
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
american
ipa
citrus
bombs
overall
not
a
bad
ipa
fairly
simple
and
not
too
memorable
but
very
drinkable
with
a
well
hidden
alcohol
level
considering
the

not

this
at
all
after

i
was

for
the
next

to

hate
to
slam
a

but
i
will
not
dabble
with
meantimes
brews
unless
i
hear
good
words
from
someone
else
a
pretty
decent
english
ipa
but
not
something
that
i
would
ever
really
buy
again
it
does
however
leave
me
interested
to
try
some
of
their
other
beers
poured
from
a
330
ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
coded
date
very
cool
bottle
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
golden
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
the
smell
is
of
light
hops
and
caramel
malts
the
feel
is
medium
to
a
little
heavy
the
taste
is
pretty
good
caramel
and
other

a
nice
medium

not
much

ever
so
just
off

two

head
with

clean

lightish

persistent
with
an
understated
melon

bitterness
which
makes
for
a
very
satisfying
mouthfeel
very
classy
doesnt
drink
anything
like
a
7

abv
beer
probably
the
most
sophisticated
ipa
i
have
ever
had
could
imagine
splitting
a
bottle
of
this
poolside
with
cary
grant
while
chatting
up
grace
kelly
picked
this
up
at

in
utrect
the
netherlands
slightly
hazy
amberyellow
pour
with
two
finger
head
with
nice
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
pretty
much
dominated
with
sweet
caramel
malt
that
plays
well
with
the
fruitiness
with
that
said
its
not
your
typical
west
coast
citrus
bomb
but
more
mangoes
apricots
and
tangerines
with
hints
of
bread
and
grass
and
just
a
touch
of
pine
the
malt
dominates
the
taste
initially
with
tons
of
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
but
as
it
warms
the
bitter
hop
bite
comes
into
play
to
balance
this
one
out
to
perfection
hints
of
orange
zest
biscuit
tea
and
toast
with
just
a
touch
of
pine
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
and
sweet
to
start
but
yields
to
a
subtle
tangy
bitter
finish
at
7
5
its
a
little
stronger
than
the
typical
english
ipa
but
you
dont
notice
it
and
this
is
oh
so
drinkable
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
and
my
first
but
not
last
taste
of
meantime
o
truly
an
english
ipa
as
there
is
no
noticeable
hop
profile
here
not
bad
but
definitely
needs
a
bit
more
character
to
be
memorable
o
i
am
not
sure
what
happened
with
this
one
i
think
i
may
have
gotten
a
pour
from
the
bottom
of
the
cask
oh
well
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
was
but
i
doubt
i
would
seek
it
out
again
one
of
the
only
true
old
school
brit
ipas
overall
a
rather
delicious
quaff
completely
different
than
the
american
style
of
ipa
at
7
5
abv
which
was
never
noticeable
it
was
the
strongest
beer
at
the
festival
i
would
drink
this
again
o
not
a
beer
i
would
have
ever
tried
but
definitely
glad
i
tried
it
decent
beer
this
11
2
ounce
bottle
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
low
head
built
up
on
this
cloudy
bottleconditioned
ipa
with
a
pale
orange
hue
mild
hop
aroma
moderate
bitterness
with
hints
of
light
caramel
and
a
certain
warmth
very
little
lacing
its
overall
hop
bitterness
and
body
lend
itself
closer
to
an
american
ipa
then
a
english
one
at
least
that
is
what
my
tongue
is
telling
me
refreshing
overall
not
especially
impressed
here
its
a
decent
enough
slightly
above
average
beer
that
i
will
not
be
tripping
over
myself
to
revisit
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
yellow
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
earthy
grassy
and
some
pine
hops
in
the
taste
gingerbread
malt
with
earthy
and
grassy
hops
with
just
a
touch
of
lemon
citrus
a
mellow
hop
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
lightly
dry
and
mellow
hop
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
english
ipa
quite
enjoyable
overall
impressed
and
am
hopeful
this
shows
up
at
our
shop
in
paris
asap
definitely
would
be
a
go
to
if
i
am
in
need
of
some
hops
if
only
this
was
ontap
every
night
this
beer
has
a
good
base
and
i
think
the
malt
content
is
just
about
spot
on
but
the
hops
really
need
work
but
then
again
english
beers
traditionally
focus
on
malt
so
thats
not
too
surprising
if
this
beer
had
nz
hops
added
to
it
at
the
start
of
the
boil
and
also
in
dry
hopping
i
think
it
would
be
pretty
fantastic
ooverall
this
beer
is
just
ok
pretty
drinkable
decent
flavor
but
nothing
too
outstanding
thats
about
it
i
may
get
this
one
again
because
it
is
a
well
crafted
ipa
but
i
am
definitely
going
to
add
meantime
to
my
list
of
breweries
and
keep
an
eye
out
for
their
other
beers
to
try
a
clean
british
ipa
solid
and
not
exciting
o
this
is
not
your
typical
english
ipa
solid
beer
overall
worth
a
try
i
would
buy
this
again
overall
i
like
it
worth
trying
but
there
are
better
ipas
out
there
this
is
my
favourite
of
all
the
english
ipas
i
have
tried
so
far
overall
the
biggest
thing
i
like
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
balanced
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
it
is
not
a
hop
bomb
and
the
flavors
compliment
each
other
extremely
well
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
overall
just
an
excellent
beer
o
traditional
english
ipa
not
aggressive
as
an
american
ipa
however
very
tasty
and
drinkable
nice
plenty
of
hoppy
aroma
but
little
bitterness
different
from
an
american
ipa
that
has
both
considerable
aroma
and
overwhelming
bitterness
perhaps
a
little
sweet
but
the
malt
and
hops
balance
well
and
the
presence
of
yeast
adds
depth
a
pleasantly
crafted
english
ipa
that
is
worth
sampling
overall
a
bit
weak
in
terms
of
an
ipa
you
expect
that
nice
brittish
hoppy
bite
but
you
dont
get
it
the
sweetness
would
be
much
more
balanced
if
there
was
a
bit
more
hop
in
there
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
sam
smiths
when
its
fresh
is
better
but
this
gives
a
pretty
clear
view
of
the
eipa
worth
a
pickup
unfortunately
english
ipas
dont
get
the
credit
they
deserve
this
is
a
world
class
example
that
should
not
be
ignored
o
i
think
i
would
like
a
touch
more
of
the
english
hop
flavors
and
a
touch
less
of
alcohol
seems
just
a
touch
solventy
for
me
i
like
the
malt
flavor
but
the
hops
loose
if
for
me
solid
bitterness
just
wish
there
was
a
touch
more
hop
character
and
again
awesome
bottlebottlecap
counts
for
extra
points
with
collectors
i
bet
taste
is
very
subtle
and
refined
compared
to
the
wallop
of
hops
you
get
when
tasting
an
american
ipa
it
fills
your
pallate
with
citrus
and
spice
and
then
flows
smoothly
down
the
throat
leaving
an
undertone
of
bitter
hops
i
drink
this
very
often
and
each
time
i
drink
it
i
fall
even
more
in
love
with
it
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
classic
english
ipa
i
would
definitely
pull
this
bad
boy
out
to
show
someone
not
familiar
with
the
style
what
it
is
like
o
a
good
drink
definitely
worth
a
try
sweet
bottle
btw
the
taste
is
pretty
sweet
and
fruity
all
things
considered
some
caramel
in
the
background
as
well
as
a
bit
of
yeasty
fruit
other
than
that
also
some
floral
and
herbal
hops
mouthfeel
is
slightly
bitter
and
a
bit
cloying
with
all
the
sweetness
medium
body
drinks
pretty
well
and
the
alcohol
certainly
isnt
all
that
noticeable
at
all
conclusion
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
this
style
hopped
up
with
english
style
hops
and
malty
enough
to
keep
things
from
going
off
the
hop
deep
end
complex
for
this
style
im
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
batch
or
what
but
my
first
indication
of
a
bad
beer
was
on
the
pop
there
was
none
popped
the
cork
and
nothing
there
was
no
head
or
carbonation
when
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
the
smell
was
foul
like
malted
mold
the
taste
was
absolutely
awful
slick
and
musty
i
had
to
pour
it
out
im
assuming
since
everyone
else
rated
it
so
well
i
got
a
bad
one
wont
try
it
again
although
this
beer
is
not
as
aggressive
with
its
hops
flavor
as
an
american
ipa
it
is
a
very
solid
offering
the
taste
is
balanced
with
a
decent
malt
profile
to
work
with
the
hops
d
overall
this
is
a
finely
balanced
ipa
the
flavors
are
developed
without
any
one
being
domineering
very
reserved
yet
satisfying
i
dont
see
the
appeal
of
this
beer
except
for
its
fancy
bottle
and
cool
label
ive
never
had
a
true
english
ipa
except
this
one
but
i
am
sure
there
exist
much
better
representations
of
the
style
this
one
was
a
complete
waste
of
liver
and
dollar
alike
one
of
my
friends
that
i
shared
the
bottle
with
went
as
far
as
calling
it
a
vile
beverage
while
i
might
not
have
such
an
extreme
sentiment
i
am
not
buying
this
again
and
perhaps
avoiding
it
for
free
too
unless
it
smells
of
something
remotely
hoppy
in
which
case
i
would
chalk
my
experience
up
to
a
badold
bottle
d
a
good
beer
but
one
of
the
best
i
am
a
bit
full
perhaps
id
enjoy
this
beer
more
on
a
emptier
stomach
no
probably
not
if
you
want
an
english
ipa
meanwhiles
a
solid
pick
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
one
up
beer
is
pretty
full
bodied
and
has
this
spicy
bitter
finish
to
it
that
is
pretty
nice
overall
its
a
good
beer
the
forward
malt
sweetness
is
well
balanced
with
the
carbonation
level
and
the
midpalate
flavors
of
mild
spice
and
earthiness
the
bitterness
at
the
end
is
mild
but
appropriate
with
the
levels
of
everything
else
its
quite
a
good
beer
one
of
the
better
english
ipas
ive
had
my
gripe
is
why
cant
they
bottle
this
stuff
in
at
least
a
12
oz
bottle
whats
with
these
short
11
2oz
bottles
it
doesnt
even
fill
a
small
glass
reminds
me
of
so
many
things
we
find
in
the
supermarket
where
the
price
stays
the
same
but
the
contents
continually
shrink
i
knew
this
ipa
would
be
different
than
the
american
ones
im
used
to
but
i
was
still
shocked
by
how
different
the
beer
pours
a
deep
gold
much
lighter
than
most
ipas
and
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
the
smell
does
not
reveal
much
hops
the
first
sip
was
surprisingly
malty
and
even
had
a
strong
presence
of
alcohol
the
finish
is
dry
as
expected
but
not
the
powerful
taste
i
am
used
to
the
lack
of
strong
hop
presence
leaves
the
beer
unbalanced
in
my
mind
d
overall
this
brew
is
subtle
in
nature
but
lacks
character
with
only
having
sweetness
and
a
surprising
finish
however
it
is
the
transition
from
sweetness
to
this
finish
that
offers
a
pleasant
surprise
this
is
its
greatest
strength
but
also
is
the
greatest
weakness
of
the
brew
overall
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
brew
being
representative
of
the
ipa
style
even
by
english
standards
of
putting
less
hops
than
the
american
counterparts
it
was
far
too
sweet
and
grossly
underhopped
ive
been
passing
by
the
beer
for
a
while
and
glad
i
finally
picked
up
a
bottle
i
will
revisit
this
again
d

i
really
love
ipas
like
this
overall
a
good
eipa
advertised
on
the
tap
handle
as
an
ipa
in
big
block
letters
it
was
a
fine
a
fine
beer
but
american
drinkers
should
take
heed
of
the
fact
that
this
is
an
authentic
english
design
and
not
a
hop
bomb
d
not
feeling
it
overwhelming
soap
and
malts
even
for
an
enligh
ipa
a
stlye
i
can
appreciate
finding
it
hard
to
polish
off
the
bottle
and
move
on
d
this
is
an
excellent
english
ipa
it
seems
very
true
to
what
i
would
expect
some
of
the
orignial
versions
might
have
been
like
its
very
impressive
and
well
done
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
in
the
future
a
careful
pour
so
as
not
to
stir
up
the
lees
resulted
in
a
finger
of
offtan
head
with
low
retention
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
orangishamber
nose
was
faint
and
light
with
a
maltysugary
presence
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
very
maltysweet
taste
on
the
tongue
finish
had
a
mostly
sweet
taste
with
a
slight
tang
of
hops
on
the
extreme
finish
it
was
a
really
mellow
experience
like
drinking
hops
tea
this
would
make
a
great
entree
into
ipas
for
those
who
may
not
yet
be
committed
hopheads
if
youre
gonna
deviate
from
the
style
do
it
all
the
way
like
stones
anniversary
selection
this
beer
was
ok
but
at
10
a
bottle
ill
stick
to
checking
it
out
in
sample
size
d
a
decent
ale
that
is
both
light
and
refreshing
i
dont
think
i
would
by
this
beer
again
but
would
not
turn
it
down
if
it
were
offered
to
me
this
beer
is
a
great
example
of
the
traditional
english
ipa
if
you
are
looking
for
a
westcoast
americanstyle
ipa
you
may
be
disappointed
with
this
brew
however
this
does
allow
the
drinker
to
experience
where
the
western
ipa
brewers
derive

this

at

not

d
this
is
a
classic

which
i
regard
as
the
benchmark
for
the
style
and
so
nice
to
see
that
it
comes
from
the
home
of
ipas
this
beer
seems
to
do
a
great
job
of
sticking
to
the
traditional
english
ipa
character
if
compared
to
an
imperial
or
american
one
may
be
disappointed
the
subdued
hops
and
pleasant
biscuit
give
this
a
nice

at

generous

worth
a
try

wow
i
just
realized
that
this
beer
is
almost
gone
it
is
pretty
easy
drinking
and
very
delicious
if
nothing
else
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
well
worth
checking
out
libation
i
really
like
ipas
and
i
go
for
english
versions
when
i
can
but
i
must
say
im
a
bit
disappointed
with
the
meantime
offering
its
tasty
and
well
balanced
but
doesnt
really
lure
me
back
for
more
especially
at
the
going
price
i
could
easily
session
this
if
it
werent
for
the
abv
this
is
the
best
britishbrewed
ipa
i
can
remember
drinking
thanks
eric
drinkability
not
the
best
value
at
9
for
a
750ml
but
certainly
glad
to
see
meantime
locally
id
have
it
again
but
no
as
an
everyday
ipa
at
a
little
over
10
a
bottle
a
strong
argument
could
be
made
that
better
value
can
be
found
elsewhere
though
im
not
sure
that
many
better
examples
of
this
style
can
be
found
at
any
price
every
aspect
of
the
flavour
is
expertly
balanced
its
one
of
the
prettiest
beers
ive
seen
in
a
long
time
and
the
flaws
of
its
carbonation
are
easily
fixed
to
reveal
a
decadent
body
serve
slightly
below
room
temperature
and
enjoy
theres
no
doubting
this
is
a
benchmark
for
the
style
body
is
a
little
lighter
than
i
would
have
liked
but
the
carbonation
is
absolutely
perfect
7

abv
is
hard
to
believe
a
supremely
easy
drinker
this
is
a
beer
id
really
like
to
be
able
to
find
locally
its
got
great
balance
and
enough
of
a
hop
bite
to
please
most
i
would
imagine
drinkable
in
spades
but
i
imagine
the
slightly
higher
abv
for
an
ipa
would
limit
too
many
of
these
as
would
the
price
well
done
from
bottle
to
last
drop
an
excellent
beer
i
can
see
why
meantime
gets
a
lot
of
praise
in
the
uk
2008
brewer
of
the
year
true
english
ipas
are
tough
to
come
by
in
canada
so
you
should
give
this
a
shot
before
it
disappears
cheers
to
rr
for
importing
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
for
a
beer
of
7
5abv
nearing
a
double
ipa
an
excellent
beer
overall
this
is
a
lot
like
drinking
a
stronger
version
of
an
esb
and
that
classic
english
malt
balance
definitely
comes
through
in
spite
of
the
higher
quantities
of
hops
d
i
would
have
a
few
pints
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
a
little
different
unusual
with
all
the
cidery
qualities
but
overall
very
drinkable
this
is
my
first
english
ipa
since
becoming
serious
about
evaluating
and
rating
beers
and
i
enjoyed
this
side
of
the
style
the
flavor
profile
seems
to
be
like
a
little
brother
to
a
barley
wine
i
think
ill
have
to
search
for
more
examples
notes
good
example
of
an
english
ipa
the
hops
are
fairly
strong
and
give
a
lot
of
flavor
but
it
isnt
a
kick
you
in
the
mouth
beer
worth
keeping
an
eye
out
for
it
overall
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
not
a
style
im
crazy
about
it
has
some
redeeming
qualities
but
not
what
i
look
for
in
a
hoppy
beer
very
drinkable
beer
with
good
carbonation
and
flow
ts
very
floral
hops
probably
the
most
floral
ive
ever
smelledtasted
nice
clean
bitterness
as
well
no
malt
though
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
creamier
d
very
good
quite
unusual
for
the
style
but
enjoyable
possibly
a
session
ipa
d
could
i
drink
this
all
day
probably
not
but
i
enjoyed
it
so
much
that
i
think
i
could
give
it
a
crack
after
all
i
downed
a
750ml
bottle
in
no
time
on
the
whole
this
is
a
good
drinkable
ipa
unfortunately
it
lacks
the
xfactor
that
makes
an
ipa
great
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
a
slight
brown
with
some
cloudiness
and
a
light
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
little
lacing
aromas
revolved
more
around
the
malty
sweetness
than
the
hoppy
bitterness
some
alcohol
also
in
the
aroma
taste
was
sweet
as
well
almost
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
detected
light
to
medium
bodied
with
appropriate
carbonation
and
some
slight
oiliness
on
the
finish
good
beer
though
the
sweetness
could
limit
drinkablility
some
i
hope
this
is
just
a
terrible
mistake
and
the
beer
has
simply
turned
but
the
store
i
got
it
from
rotates
their
stock
often
enough
to
make
me
believe
this
is
just
what
this
beer
is
sad
pours
a
golden
brown
color
body
with
an
average
tan
color
head
diminishing
malty
aroma
bitter
dusty
musty
a
little
funky
light
taste
some
maltiness
more
dustiness
in
the
taste
english
tasting
probably
the
yeast
or
the
hops
eh
not
so
tasty
might
be
something
off
with
this
bottle
i
bought
this
beer
and
had
no
idea
it
came
from
england
it
said
greenwich
and
i
thought
they
were
talking
about
connecticut
as
soon
as
i
drank
it
i
sensed
english
ipa
i
looked
at
the
bottle
again
and
realized
i
was
right
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
reminded
me
that
i
should
drink
this
more
often
not
nearly
as
hoppy
or
aggressive
as
a
standard
ipa
this
is
still
a
great
beer
and
very
refreshing
while
being
interesting
good
beer
but
i
was
kind
of
expecting
more
life
lesson
if
you
want
to
be
happy
lower
your
expectations
carefully
decanted
from
a
11
2
oz
bottle
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
large
cream
colored
head
that
had
excellant
retention
the
head
settles
to
a
thick
cap
with
heavy
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
not
what
i
want
it
to
be
weak
hop
elements
of
citrus
and
bready
malt
smells
like
a
weak
apa
but
this
beer
redeems
itself
in
flavor
nicely
balanced
between
citrus
floral
and
herbal
hop
elements
and
soothing
bready
malt
bitterness
is
appropriate
for
the
style
finishes
with
a
little
herbal
aftertaste
nice
body
but
i
would
like
to
see
a
little
more
substance
especially
when
the
abv
is
at
7
5
nicely
carbonated
too
expensive
to
be
a
regular
in
my
lineup
also
has
more
alcohol
than
most
other
english
ipas
quite
a
nicely
hopped
engislh
ipa
a
bit
murky
orange
with
an
off
yellow
white
head
nice
lemon
zest
with
a
light
dry
peppery
but
bready
quality
nice
mild
sweet
maltose
and
a
wood
earthy
finish
bitterness
quite
a
nice
bright
beer
with
an
elegant
wide
malt
character
d
that
7
5
abv
is
very
wellhidden
this
beer
is
smooth
and
clean
but
has
a
nice
wallop
of
hops
hidden
inside
and
a
malty
sweetness
that
somehow
manages
not
to
cloy
is
this
the
greatest
eipa
ever
drinkability
is
very
good
almost
too
good
good
thing
i
couldnt
afford
to
have
more
d
a
little
too
light
on
tongue
but
tasty
and
refreshing
its
not
to
say
that
they
cant
make
a
hoppy
ipa
this
is
a
decent
version
of
the
style
that
originated
there
and
its
actually
better
than
a
few
other
examples
that
ive
had
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
beer
is
on
the
verge
of
being
over
carbonated
thus
the
brew
almost
stings
the
tongue
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
a
night
first
off
im
a
huge
ipa
fan
and
therefore
i
am
somewhat
critical
of
ipas
in
general
once
decorked
and
the
beer
poured
the
beer
smells
great
midway
through
your
beer
i
found
myself
saying
aloud
i
cant
believe
this
came
from
a
bottle
the
beer
actually
tastes
like
it
just
came
out
of
a
tap
excellent
beer
to
enjoy
d
very
smooth
beer
that
belies
the
alcohol
content
a
bit
pricey
so
i
wont
be
buying
a
sixer
of
this
but
very
tasty
d
overall
seems
a
bit
overly
bitter
im
a
hop
head
but
found
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
to
be
a
bit
unbalanced
definitely
not
your
typical
english
ipa
enjoyable
beer
but
probably
wouldnt
purchase
it
often
d
its
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
what
i
expected
from
an
ipa
slightly
belgian
ipa
interesting
take
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
if
only
it
were
cheaper
and
came
in
imperial
pintsized
bottles
just
the
same
im
glad
i
took
the
chance
on
this
one
its
accolades
are
well
deserved
d
its
not
bad
by
any
means
but
i
think
ill
stick
to
the
american
ipas
d
too
resiny
to
drink
loads
of
it
and
the
alcohol
will
knock
you
about
abit
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copperorange
color
with
a
one
finger
of
thick
creamy
white
head
head
recedes
rapidly
but
leaves
ample
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
of
some
floral
hops
caramel
malts
and
a
touch
of
fruitiness
like
apply
taste
fell
somewhat
flat
for
me
floral
hops
dominate
at
first
and
then
malt
takes
over
some
grainy
and
pale
malts
in
here
a
touch
of
apple
and
the
finish
is
of
caramel
malts
the
balance
of
the
flavors
seemed
off
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
and
crisp
this
beer
went
down
quite
smoothly
but
not
one
that
i
would
sit
with
for
an
evening
the
taste
is
quite
candied
sugar
sweet
almost
belgianesque
underneath
but
there
is
some
unusual
hoppy
acerbicness
a
thick
syrupy
consistency
and
a
fairly
boozy
presence
this
beer
is
just
odd
there
is
all
the
makings
of
a
sweetish
belgian
beer
with
its
sweet
florals
and
syrupy
texture
then
you
get
some
hop
acerbicness
and
some
drying
notes
maybe
some
hop
leaf
notes
and
then
you
get
the
syrupy
abv
presence
in
the
mouth
and
throat
this
beer
is
just
plain
unusual
for
the
style
and
not
a
typical
english
ipa
that
ive
ever
had
worth
a
try
but
it
is
unusual
d
this
beer
doesnt
really
have
any
hop
aroma
or
flavor
except
for
the
bitterness
that
doesnt
have
much
character
in
itself
no
real
off
flavors
except
for
the
plastic
and
there
were
no
real
hop
flavors
except
for
the
bitterness
this
is
by
far
the
best
english
ipa
i
have
had
i
would
consider
it
the
benchmark
for
the
style
highly
recommended
d
drinking
a
whole
bottle
on
my
own
and
although
i
would
love
to
sgare
i
am
liking
the
fact
i
have
more
d
loved
it
i
was
particularly
taken
by
the
typical
english
ipa
character
tweaked
with
a
very
present
yeast
aroma
and
flavor
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
again
my
first
time
trying
an
english
ipa
was
not
a
good
one
please
someone
assure
me
that
this
is
just
my
bottle
but
this
wasnt
that
great
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
alot
more
rather
drinkable
alcohol
is
barely
noticed
the
flavor
profile
is
rather
enjoyable
and
rounds
out
as
it
reaches
room
temperature
will
have
to
revisit
this
is
quite
possibly
one
the
better
if
not
the
best
english
ipas
ive
encountered
in
quite
sometime
super
sessionable
and
a
well
balanced
subtle
tasty
treat
damn
yummy
stuff
d
this
is
an
interesting
english
ipa
with
a
lot
of
hop
character
the
belgian
level
of
bottle
conditioned
carbonation
is
an
unusual
twist
for
the
style
but
it
helps
lift
the
somewhat
sweet
finish
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
but
i
still
greatly
prefer
american
hop
character
in
my
ipas
d
i
found
this
to
be
a
sipper
and
while
i
really
enjoyed
my
11
2
oz
single
i
wouldnt
really
want
another
right
away
a
very
interesting
take
on
an
english
ipa
it
pours
a
sandy
bronze
color
with
a
billowy
white
head
that
doesnt
last
but
leaves
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
floral
sort
of
buttery
the
taste
is
more
savory
than
you
usually
get
from
an
ipa
with
some
meaty
fatty
notes
but
also
some
nice
herbal
floral
and
citrus
tones
and
a
sharp
bitter
finish
its
moderately
carbonated
rather
fullbodied
pleasant
on
the
tongue
not
the
easiest
to
down
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
i
like
this
brew
but
am
somewhat
disappointed
and
frustrated
by
it
i
would
have
to
say
brooklyns
east
india
and
twisted
thistle
and
probably
a
few
others
would
be
ahead
of
this
in
my
book
still
worth
trying
and
ill
probably
give
it
another
shot
at
some
point
d
very
drinkable
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
thanks
for
reading
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
and
frankly
i
still
want
more
hops
english
or
not
poured
into
a
grapefruity
colored
decent
head
with
a
larger
than
usual
bubble
ring
nice
color
smells
floral
and
hoppy
of
course
that
is
the
hops
very
complex
smell
slighty
grapefruity
as
well
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
great
forward
hoppy
center
and
malty
aftertaste
with
still
a
hops
at
the
very
end
yum
mouthfeel
is
good
complex
with
hops
and
malty
equal
malty
and
hoppy
very
good
easy
to
drink
this
above
average
gravity
beer
750
ml
corked
bottle
an
interesting
counterpart
to
the
overly
bitter
american
hop
bombs
this
takes
the
style
in
the
other
direction
a
bit
to
sweet
imo
i
expect
english
ipas
to
have
a
great
balance
between
malt
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
this
does
not
though
as
the
history
goes
this
is
probably
closer
to
the
original
ipas
made
in
england
during
the
1700s
than
anything
else
i
have
had
pours
with
a
dense
cream
white
head
mainly
tiny
sticky
bubbles
with
a
few
larger
ones
interspersed
carpets
the
glass
sides
with
lacing
warm
glow
to
the
fat
sunset
orange
color
as
much
light
brown
mixed
in
as
yellow
moderate
transparency
excellent
clarity
to
the
nose
with
spacing
among
the
pine
oil
grapefruit
and
orange
citrus
daisies
and
other
wildflowers
green
apple
and
pear
fruit
golden
honey
and
sweet
tea
scents
close
to
fullbodied
here
it
is
more
compact
and
woven
into
a
unified
whole
the
carbonation
level
is
excellent
and
carries
the
flavors
while
allowing
the
palate
to
enjoy
the
array
of
textures
on
the
sweet
side
of
the
spectrum
emphasizing
pink
grapefruit
tangerine
lime
citrus
honey
and
flaky
pastry
dough
the
malt
flavor
is
there
smoothing
influence
too
but
it
does
not
reach
the
level
of
chocolate
or
caramel
found
in
other
beers
light
clove
and
cinnamon
spice
break
through
near
the
end
as
well
as
dried
oat
cereal
very
clean
finish
with
tempting
aftertaste
and
weight
echoes
across
the
tongue
d
refreshing
drink
but
not
impressive
hops
are
nice
but
delicate
malts
are
small
and
smooth
doesnt
quite
spark
my
interest
enough
to
try
again
but
was
decent
i
prefer
the
hoppier
maltier
stronger
american
ipa
happy
sampling
solid

beer
and
one
of
my
top

beers

still
waiting
for

moment
thanks
to
keith
for
sharing
a
bottle
this
appears
a
classic
hazy
light
orange
with
a
tight
white
head
the
hops
and
malt
are
a
little
too
well
blended
and
neither
really
stand
out
i
can
tell
theres
a
grassycitrus
mix
and
dry
bready
malts
but
theyre
hard
to
pick
apart
this
sort
of
flavor
reminds
me
more
of
a
underhopped
pale
ale
otherwise
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
overall
tasty
id
just
want
a
little
more
from
it
d
all
up
its
very
tasty
but
somewhat
sweet
i
think
its
on
the
same
vector
as
english
barley
wine
only
lighter
d
notes
the
bitterness
in
this
beer
is
very
well
done

my
sense
is
that

very
attractive
nose
of
caramel
malts
and
some
grassy
hops
very
smooth
and
rich
mouthfeel
flavor
is
of
citrus
and
pine
hops
and
the
finish
is
nice
and
bitter
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
ipas
i
have
seen
this
is
certainly
no
hop
bomb
and
heavy
on
the
malty
and
fruity
sweetness
still
a
very
drinkable
brew
drinkability
high
if
it
werent
a
challenge
to
remove
the
cage
and
cork
from
the
bottle
i
wouldve
enjoyed
more
recommend
enjoying
this
ipa
across
the
pond
as
it
happens
to
lose
something
in
shipment
i
e
not
as
boldspicy
i
had
this
in
september
at
the
tied
pub
in
greenwich
and
i
was
interested
to
see
what
others
had
rated
it
the
color
is
a
nice
amber
and
lots
of
good
hops
aroma
but
the
bitter
flavor
is
not
as
strong
as
an
ipa
here
in
the
states
but
stronger
than
most
british
ipas
i
have
had
there
i
would
compare
it
most
to
a
slightly
hoppier
sierra
nevada
or
possibly
a
stone
pale
ale
nice
to
drink
and
pleasant
enough
for
me
to
hunt
it
out
this
side
of
the
pond
overall
excellent
keep
in
mind
though
that
this
is
an
english
ipa
and
not
an
american
ipa
so
if
youre
looking
for
a
hop
explosion
you
might
be
disappointed
either
way
i
highly
recommend
this
one
to
all
who
enjoy
a
nice
ipa
a
solid
beer
but
just
not
what
im
looking
for
in
an
ipa
any
more
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
looking
for
a
topshelf
ipa
could
drink
this
one
again
and
again
d
easy
to
drink
sweetness
is
somewhat
limiting
if
you
are
drinking
it
without
spicy
food
25
6
oz
bottle
pours
a
dense
pale
orange
with
3
cm
white
head
that
is
slowly
diminishing
aroma
of
fruit
and
hops
a
hint
of
something
malty
initial
flavor
of
sour
apple
and
citrus
ends
hoppy
and
with
some
fruit
flavors
light
to
medium
body
limited
lacing
moderate
carbonation
and
some
alcohol
noted
especially
with
warming
overall
a
very
different
ipa
than
i
was
expecting
very
good
kind
of
champagne
like
just
bought
one
large
bottle
of
this
1
pint
9
4oz
and
it
went
down
smoothly
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
with
great
lacing
the
nose
is
yeasty
alcohol
floral
hops
leather
old
oranges
the
taste
is
mellow
hops
up
front
floral
and
citrus
hops
but
definately
english
style
because
if
it
was
american
the
hops
would
be
trying
to
take
over
my
brain
with
all
of
their
immense
power
also
tastes
of
orange
citrus
sweet
malts
subtle
earthy
tone
medium
to
full
body
very
sweet
finish
i
even
split
the
bottle
with
my
girl
and
we
both
couldnt
finish
it
because
of
how
sweet
it
is
although
it
is
probably
my
favorite
english
ipa
this
ale
was
a
real
treat
and
one
that
i
will
be
returning
to
often
i
have
enjoyed
all
the
beers
iv
tried
from
this
brewery
this
the
porter
and
the
scottish
ale
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
an
orange
color
with
a
thick
white
sticky
head
aroma
of
malt
and
hops
fruity
and
floral
sweet
malt
taste
up
front
with
an
intensifying
hops
presence
still
the
beer
was
subtle
and
not
at
all
a
hop
bomb
very
nice
would
be
a
good
session
beer
d
it
was
a
great
session
ipa
it
was
well
balanced
and
entertaining
the
taste
is
sweet
and
bitter
full
of
flavour
and
complexity
applie
pine
honey
citrus
a
clear
grassy
quality
fruit
stewed
fruit
and
orange
marmalade
sweetness
with
alcoholic
warmth
coming
through
it
has
a
dryish
hoppp
spicey
finish
and
is
great
alone
or
with
food
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
quaff
to
please
the
palate
and
not
the
least
bit
complicated
really
a
pleasant
session
beer
that
is
nowhere
next
to
being
a
hop
bomb
this
one
poured
nearly
clear
with
a
deep
orange
colour
and
an
inch
of
beige
foam
after
it
settled
a
bit
the
cap
formed
a
thick
clumpy
collar
and
some
chunky
lacing
nice
aroma
fruity
esters
caramel
malts
and
floralgrassy
hops
with
notes
of
citrus
good
flavour
too
with
oranges
and
biscuity
malts
up
front
grassy
and
herbal
hops
balanced
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
more
caramel
appeared
in
the
malt
profile
as
it
warmed
along
with
orange
peel
and
cake
medium
bodied
seemed
like
the
attenuation
was
on
the
low
side
due
to
a
bit
of
a
sugary
mouthfeel
well
integrated
carbonation
light
alcohol
warmth
and
spiciness
this
stuff
is
quite
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
plus
the
balance
is
great
definitely
something
id
grab
again
i
actually
liked
this
quite
a
bit
id
come
back
here
for
sure
pours
a
hazy
honeyed
orange
color
fluffy
offwhite
head
not
a
lot
of
lacing
tons
of
floaties
in
the
glass
rich
malty
smell
soft
grassy
hop
aroma
very
sweet
and
bready
sweet
caramel
taste
some
tangerine
a
hint
of
pine
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
creeps
in
but
its
nice
creamy
active
little
bubbles
very
slight
lingering
hoppy
bitterness
its
there
and
you
know
youve
been
drinking
an
ipa
but
definitely
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
hoppier
beers
im
so
fond
of
this
is
excellent
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
this
brewery
it
took
a
while
for
me
to
get
through
half
of
this
by
the
time
i
got
to
the
second
half
it
was
muuuuch
warmer
and
it
really
started
growing
on
me
it
became
more
floral
and
grassy
the
flavor
really
improved
id
for
sure
get
this
again
and
let
it
warm
up
more
before
i
drank
it
try
this
however
i
believe
this
an
authentic
eipa
and
for
that
i
think
im
generous
with
the
score
pretty
good
eipa
this
beer
has
great
balance
something
you
dont
find
in
most
aipas
this
is
one
decent
beer
recommended
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
its
not
extreme
nor
is
it
bland
its
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
i
like
american
iipas
a
lot
but
this
would
be
nice
to
have
on
a
regular
basis
too
very
attractive
looking
corked
and
caged
750ml
bottle
pours
a
very
attractive
golden
orange
color
with
a
nice
creamy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
citrusy
hops
a
lot
fainter
than
what
i
expected
from
an
ipa
the
taste
has
to
be
one
of
the
sweetest
ipas
i
have
tasted
almost
a
honey
like
sweetness
with
some
hops
in
the
finish
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
because
of
the
high
amount
of
sweetness
if
it
was
a
little
less
sweet
i
think
it
would
be
a
great
brew
i
think
the
hop
profile
is
pretty
solid
this
poured
a
slightly
hazy
dark
gold
color
with
good
white
head
it
smelled
much
sweeter
than
expected
like
lots
of
caramel
malt
with
some
prunes
and
citrus
hops
it
tasted
very
mellow
and
balanced
like
roasted
malt
and
caramel
with
some
sweet
citrus
hops
it
was
thick
with
no
carbonation
and
had
a
lasting
sugary
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
sweet
and
malty
beer
hardly
what
i
consider
an
ipa
but
it
still
had
very
clean
flavor
and
great
body
md
the
beer
was
full
bodied
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
nice
bitter
aftertaste
but
highly
drinkable
i
will
be
going
back
to
buy
more
in
the
near
future
and
plan
to
keep
it
in
stock
all
summer
exceptional
beer
highly
recommend
to
any
lover
of
the
ipa
d
i
was
not
impressed
with
the
taste
was
expecting
more
hop
flavor
and
complexity
nice
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
and
the
carbonation
is
quite
minimal
as
if
it
had
been
poured
from
a
tap
so
there
was
no
extra
carbonation
like
in
most
bottled
beer
very
easy
to
drink
but
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
overwhelming
d
this
is
an
excellent
english
ipa
i
really
enjoyed
trying
this
one
would
very
much
like
to
sample
this
brew
again
wish
i
could
find
some
smaller
bottles
of
the
stuff
750ml
was
size
of
the
bottle
would
love
to
have
a
six
pack
sitting
in
my
fridge
taste
mirroring
the
aroma
the
fruit
and
caramel
are
in
it
to
win
it
fruit
is
complimented
by
burnt
currant
and
toasted
bread
flavors
from
the
malt
hop
flavor
comes
on
mid
palate
herbal
grassy
and
mild
finish
is
bready
with
some
lingering
earthy
flavor
from
the
hops
as
the
malt
drops
away
good
if
i
ever
get
to
sample
a
fresher
batch
i
will
rereview
very
carbonated
can
see
it
and
feel
it
not
sure
about
this
very
pricey
but
also
very
different
in
a
good
way
drinkability
is
fairly
high
as
the
alcohol
is
relatively
moderate
and
the
flavors
are
great
alcohol
is
also
well
hidden
add
it
all
together
and
we
have
a
very
drinkable
english
ipa
quite
a
nice
brew
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
into
two
pint
glasses
pours
a
deep
gold
color
with
a
strong
head
the
carbonation
rose
in
a
cyclone
fashion
which
was
preety
enjoyable
to
watch
a
lot
of
hops
in
the
nose
taste
is
even
hoppier
with
a
dry
and
bitter
finish
that
takes
some
getting
used
to
pretty
different
from
american
ipas
but
still
tasty
overall
a
very
good
ipa
while
i
prefer
american
ipas
this
is
still
a
damn
good
brew
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
as
an
english
ipa
this
is
a
nice
take
as
i
understand
it
and
definitely
sets
it
apart
from
other
ipa
renditions
as
such
its
worth
coming
back
to
provided
one
knows
what
it
is
time
to
try
the
london
porter
d
good
drinkability
nice
malt
tones
add
complexity
to
a
good
english
ipa
and
is
enjoyable
it
looks
like
a
hefewiesen
in
its
cloudy
yellow
appearance
the
aroma
was
mostly
clean
with
subtle
hops
hopheads
will
not
be
overly
excited
about
this
brew
i
thought
it
was
well
crafted
and
would
strongly
recommend
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
soft
booze
is
unapparent
body
is
a
shade
under
medium
thickness
a
friend
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
for
a
recent
tasting
pours
a
quite
cloudy
straw
shade
with
a
thick
head
aroma
is
weak
for
an
ipa
lots
of
carbonation
almost
tingles
like
champagne
on
the
tounge
wheres
the
hops
the
hop
kick
is
essential
in
an
ipa
and
this
just
doesnt
have
it
no
bitterness
really
disappointed
with
this
english
ipa
only
my
love
of
all
things
british
allowed
me
to
fork
out
the
ridiculously
expensive
amount
of
green
it
took
to
buy
just
one
bottle
orangey
amber
color
had
good
head
retention
and
decent
lacing
aroma
was
inviting
a
bit
of
citrus
and
other
fruity
notes
were
evident
this
is
supposed
to
be
made
true
tot
he
original
style
which
was
loaded
with
hops
but
i
didnt
think
it
was
that
hoppy
some
orangey
hoppiness
seemed
to
be
the
main
flavor
a
flavor
i
have
detected
in
some
other
ipas
but
i
expected
a
bit
more
sharp
hops
here
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
and
it
tasted
good
in
its
way
just
a
bit
of
a
letdown
and
way
to
expensive
cheers
however
upon
first
taste
one
is
let
down
there
is
a
frothy
citrus
note
leftover
in
the
mouth
as
sort
of
an
afterthought
to
lots
of
carbonation
not
very
bitter
overall
and
somewhat
devoid
of
depth
of
flavor
perhaps
just
overly
subtle
i
dont
know
why
this
beer
gets
the
applause
that
it
does
and
it
is
most
certainly
not
worth
the
coin
d
if
only
it
came
in
smaller
bottles
it
would
be
great
complex
without
being
overpowering
a
beer
well
worth
trying
drinkability
this
is
a
damn
drinkable
and
creamy
beverage
every
sip
gives
another
taste
of
hops
and
malt
this
is
just
what
a
beer
of
this
style
should
be
very
nice
work
from
a
brewery
that
i
can
find
no
more
beers
from
recommended
this
is
easily
my
favorite
english
ipa
well
balanced
and
quite
tasty
d
this
is
a
great
english
ipa
one
of
the
most
drinkable
of
the
style
if
you
havent
had
it
go
for
it
d
incredibly
drinkable
the
fruits
and
the
hops
really
keep
you
addicted
750
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
from
the
lighthouse
in
manchester
pours
a
hazy
yelloworange
body
with
a
good
inch
of
rocky
offwhite
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
and
clings
to
the
side
of
the
glass
smells
citrusy
grassy
and
herbal
if
i
had
to
guess
fuggles
tastes
citrusy
grapefruit
orange
grassy
sweet
with
some
caramel
full
rich
body
though
not
viscous
by
any
means
moderate
carbonation
enough
to
leave
a
semiclean
finish
wow
very
tasty
and
dangerously
drinkable
far
and
away
the
very
best
example
of
the
style
english
ipa
that
i
have
ever
encountered
one
of
the
best
ipas
of
any
kind
ive
had
a
bit
pricey
9bottle
but
wellworth
the
treat
at
7
5
abv
its
a
big
but
not
too
big
beer
in
moderation
it
makes
a
fine
session
beer
as
with
most
beers
it
seemed
fresher
and
better
on
tap
a
tasty
treat
for
anyone
looking
for
a
solid
ipa
d
very
drinkablesessionable
this
one
definitely
hit
me
by
suprise
i
might
have
to
seek
it
out
again
poured
hazy
orange
w
a
four
finger
off
white
seafoam
head
that
left
a
good
amount
of
sticky
lace
from
top
to
bottom
the
aroma
was
subtle
however
i
got
hints
of
sweet
pear
white
grapes
and
straw
upfront
somewhere
in
the
middle
he
scent
of
fresh
cut
grass
and
flowers
with
a
doughy
finish
i
was
not
so
impress
with
the
taste
or
mouthfeel
medium
body
with
a
toffee
sweet
beginning
that
faded
out
quicky
leaving
a
light
alcoholic
and
soft
carbonation
feel
a
long
lasting
bitter
ended
the
drink
overall
i
felt
this
ipa
was
on
the
weak
side
then
again
i
prefer
american
ipa
over
english
ipa
i
feel
american
ipa
has
more
depth
in
all
catagories
overall
well
worth
the
8
99
i
paid
for
it
at
the
whole
foods
market
in
tualatin
m
overriding
carbonation
all
the
bubbles
fill
the
mouth
with
lots
of
air
on
the
swallow
then
the
hoppy
bitterness
presents
itself
the
color
of
light
orange
peel
with
a
small
head
of
slightly
off
white
foma
aromas
are
citrus
and
hop
with
some
nice
fresh
baked
bread
malts
as
well
this
one
is
not
that
hoppy
for
an
ipa
but
for
a
british
ipa
it
is
quite
hoppy
very
refreshing
zesty
and
drinkable
due
to
the
smooth
mouthfeel
and
snappy
hop
spice
flavor
a
goodie
overall
a
very
nice
english
ipa
a
bit
pricey
but
worth
checking
out
as
it
has
a
good
complexity
and
nice
flavors
that
work
well
together
thanks
again
john
dvery
good
nothing
real
intense
so
very
approachable
you
could
even
say
light
enough
to
drink
all
day
long
nearperfect
balance
in
this
brew
im
going
to
save
a
bottle
and
see
how
it
ages
a
buy
well
worth
it
amazing
and
very
different
from
the
traditional
piney
grapefruit
ipas
i
am
used
to
a
must
try
for
any
ipa
fan
overall
impression
mellow
english
ipa
easy
drinking

liked
it
better

this
is
a
good
smooth
ipa
nothing
showy
at
all
but
more
along
a
traditional
line
i
would
say
nice
to
try
pours
a
cloudy
orangepeach
haze
nice
fluffy
head
with
good
lace
the
nose
is
of
hops
but
not
the
piney
grapefruit
hop
smell
of
nw
ipas
the
british
brew
has
a
subtle
nose
the
taste
is
incredibly
smooth
spicy
at
first
then
picks
up
speed
with
hops
flavors
very
unique
hop
taste
but
still
has
a
nice
bitter
bite
yet
uniquely
smooth
kind
of
strange
and
reminds
me
more
of
a
cross
between
a
belgian
and
an
american
style
ipa
very
interesting
beer
and
very
very
refreshing
good
beer
from
meantime
recommended
i
will
say
that
this
beer
was
in
the
cellar
for
a
while
so
some
of
the
hop
flavors
may
have
diminished
and
i
may
have
underrated
the
nose
a
highly
interesting
and
different
ipa
i
suspect
that
it
might
be
even
better
off
after
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
ive
had
a
lot
of
beers
that
are
5s
in
smell
or
in
taste
but
this
is
by
far
the
best
feeling
best
drinking
brew
ive
ever
had
the
fact
that
its
still
quite
hoppy
is
a
bonus
you
dont
even
appriciate
until
the
thought
hits
you
overall
good
for
kicks
give
it
a
try
this
brew
is
probably
the
best
english
ipa
ive
had
to
date
just
tastes
like
i
always
hoped
my
eipas
did
there
is
something
to
do
with
the
hardness
of
the
water
i
told
brenda
that
i
would
probably
never
buy
this
one
again
just
based
on
the
price
i
think
i
may
have
lied
a
bit
d
really
drinkable
totally
unique
beer
definitely
worth
the
9
everyone
is
noting
that
this
is
a
uk
ipa
but
it
would
be
better
described
as
a
historical
ipa
along
the
lines
of
that
4
pack
sam
adams
puts
out
well
done
this
has
a
frustratingly
elusive
quality
but
its
also
clearly
damn
good
maybe
its
one
of
those
beers
that
tastes
wildly
different
went
stored
and
drank
at
different
temperatures
maybe
it
has
the
kind
of
complexity
that
takes
awhile
to
unravel
theres
just
one
bottle
here
granted
a
nice
big
bottle
so
i
cant
claim
any
kind
of
trusted
experience
on
it
i
do
know
its
an
easytoenjoy
ipa
one
that
hides
its
7
5
very
well
one
that
clearly
differs
from
its
american
counterparts
would
love
to
try
their
porter
a
great
beer
has
some
more
all
around
heft
than
im
used
to
with
an
english
ale
id
like
to
see
others
follow
meantimes
lead
looks
really
nice
hazy
light
orange
nice
frothy
white
head
that
diminishes
slightly
but
pretty
much
sticks
around
the
whole
quaff
nice
lace
as
well
i
expected
the
smell
to
be
a
little
more
pungent
but
it
is
pleasing
none
the
less
nice
brit
hop
profile
citrusy
but
not
grapefruity
sweet
malt
and
some
biscuit
taste
was
better
than
the
nose
suggested
i
experienced
a
well
balanced
beer
that
had
a
generous
hopping
dry
hopped
too
but
a
hopping
that
didnt
strictly
run
the
show
i
enjoyed
the
sweet
malty
backbone
and
long
smooth
finish
with
a
bite
i
just
really
enjoyed
the
taste
and
the
bitter
thing
i
experience
in
most
of
the
english
ipas
ive
tried
wasnt
there
i
appreciate
the
taste
of
the
hop
more
that
way
almost
what
i
would
call
full
bodied
and
very
soft
and
silky
ill
have
another
please
drinkability
seems
more
like
a
well
balanced
american
made
ipa
than
one
of
english
style
either
way
its
a
great
beer
that
is
tops
for
me
in
english
and
one
of
the
better
ones
under
american
ive
past
this
beer
by
several
times
because
of
the
10
price
tag
but
i
will
be
returning
again
to
try
excellent
job
poured
a
slightly
hazy
goldenorange
one
finger
head
that
hung
around
a
while
the
aroma
was
lemony
and
tealike
the
flavor
threw
me
for
a
loop
at
first
it
was
wellhopped
but
with
english
hops
so
the
profile
was
different
i
tasted
crushed
childrens
chewable
aspirin
at
first
that
soon
expanded
into
an
earthy
hoppiness
that
became
pleasantly
balanced
between
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
grainy
malt
lent
sufficient
backbone
to
carry
the
hop
flavors
and
ale
fruitiness
i
spotted
this
one
at
the
local
grocery
store
and
had
to
give
it
a
try
i
had
never
heard
of
meantime
brewing
company
but
i
was
intrigued
the
beer
pours
a
golden
copper
very
hazy
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
lingers
the
label
warms
of
a
slight
haze
and
i
am
certainly
not
disappointed
the
aroma
is
sharp
resiny
piney
and
herbal
hops
with
a
light
background
of
pale
malts
malt
sweetness
and
hop
flavor
mostly
citrus
and
pine
appear
in
the
flavor
up
front
this
is
followed
by
a
strong
assertive
bitterness
i
think
the
beer
could
use
just
a
bit
more
malt
sweetness
to
balance
the
bitterness
im
curious
how
true
this
beer
is
to
1820s
ipas
i
like
the
idea
ill
have
to
look
for
their
other
beers
now
on
the
second
tasting
i
can
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
ipas
ive
had
to
date
it
does
not
disappoint
however
this
is
a
beer
that
should
be
savored
an
interesting
beer
from
an
interesting
brewery
well
worth
trying
a
tasty
beverage
but
a
mild
ipa
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
good
beer
but
its
a
simple
and
subtle
ipa
definitely
a
british
ipa
it
has
slight
sweet
fruitycitrus
start
and
a
subtle
hop
finish
and
low
carbination
at
7
5
the
flavor
grows
on
you
and
is
delicious
especially
at
the
bottom
of
the
750ml
bottle
very
worth
a
try
this
was
a
very
tasty
beer
i
hope
the
rest
of
meantimes
brews
are
this
good
i
plan
on
trying
the
porter
next
this
was
one
of
the
best
beers
i
tried
at
the
charlotte
oktoberfest
meantime
had
some
very
nice
selections
but
i
only
went
with
the
ipa
and
believe
i
made
the
right
choice
can
tell
the
alochol
is
in
there
but
the
hops
mask
some
of
it
nice
orange
hues
with
a
good
head
a
bit
hard
to
drink
a
pint
but
i
will
do
my
best
given
the
chance
next
time
pours
a
cloudy
golden
amber
color
with
a
big
foamy
off
white
head
that
resists
fading
visible
effervescence
and
a
few
ultra
tiny
suspended
particles
considerably
more
sediment
on
the
bottom
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
floral
and
perfumy
light
bodied
the
mouth
feel
is
lightly
carbonated
yet
slightly
sour
and
smooth
the
flavor
is
lightly
lemon
and
tropical
fruits
a
nice
drinker
really
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
pours
up
a
lightly
hazed
peach
color
with
a
volumnous
light
beige
head
that
stays
pillowy
atop
the
ale
for
a
good
while
lacing
all
the
way
down
zesty
aromas
of
fuggles
and
golding
hops
with
a
bit
of
honeyed
biscuit
in
the
malt
department
malty
and
sweet
upfront
moving
towards
a
grassy
herbal
hop
bite
midpalate
and
finishing
lightly
bitter
with
some
lingering
fruitiness
akin
to
fuzzyskinned
fruits
like
apricot
and
peach
carbonation
is
pretty
subtle
but
ample
mouthfeel
is
about
average
with
a
good
amount
of
malt
to
give
it
a
good
body
very
drinkable
and
fresh
tasting
one
of
the
better
english
ipas
to
come
from
across
the
pond
rather
expensive
due
to
its
corked
and
caged
presentation
but
id
have
it
again
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
red
color
with
bright
orange
hues
the
head
is
mammoth
billowy
and
white
the
aroma
is
floral
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
a
slight
pleasant
metalic
notes
at
the
end
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
moderate
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
lighter
than
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
adequate
overall
this
is
a
very
refreshing
ipa
with
a
subtle
and
complex
flavor
profile
i
will
certainly
drink
this
again
m
rough
on
middleback
of
my
tongue
harsh
first
two
sips
smooth
as
silk
afterwards
overall
first
time
i
have
ever
seen
this
beer
and
let
me
tell
you
the
bottle
is
beautiful
it
pops
open
with
a
bang
and
pours
with
charm
the
taste
is
nice
much
different
than
the
us
versions
of
this
brew
but
very
nice
in
its
own
right
its
very
balanced
hopheads
may
be
disappointed
but
you
have
to
give
credit
to
how
they
really
brought
out
the
malts
to
compliment
this
one
i
really
like
it
and
will
buy
it
again
decent
beer
with
the
bitterness
levels
of
a
good
american
ipa
but
the
hop
flavor
is
somewhat
disappointing
i
dont
find
goldings
make
a
great
hop
flavor
when
used
to
excess
not
nearly
as
complex
as
many
american
ipas
in
the
hop
department
drinkability
high
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
was
sad
to
finish
the
bottle
this
is
a
fantastic
ipa
incredibly
well
made
truly
world
class
its
super
tasty
and
easy
drinking
and
goes
down
with
zero
indication
of
its
abv
which
is
formidable
especially
for
an
english
ale
luckily
its
elegance
encourages
one
to
savor
the
nuances
and
really
enjoy
the
brew
as
they
say
on
the
bottle
tag
drink
the
beer
and
savor
the
good
things
in
life
d

very
easy
to
drink
even
at
7
5
abv
but
take
your
time
with
this
fine
example
of
british
craft
beer
its
expensive
but
i
dare
say
its
worth
it
pretty
great
beer
i
was
afraid
of
skunking
considering
it
was
an
import
for
me
with
a
green
bottle
but
no
such
problem
cheers
this
is
a
smooth
drinking
almost
sessionable
ipa
if
it
werent
for
the
bottle
size
750ml
i
would
easily
be
able
to
put
away
3
or
4
of
these
of
hops
dangerously
easy
to
drink
beware
d
thank
you
may
i
have
another
drinkability
very
easy
drinking
most
flavorful
english
ipa
that
has
ever
graced
my
palate
felt
like
taking
a
break
from
the
typical
hop
bomb
ipas
i
consume
stone
ipa
pliny
the
elder
hopsickle
for
this
and
was
greatly
rewarded
with
complexity
not
found
in
most
ipas
overall
im
very
impressed
not
just
your
average
hopbomb
ipa
but
something
with
lots
of
character
and
complexity
uncaged
and
uncorked
this
poured
with
a
nice
sexy
yelloworange
and
a
poofy
survivable
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
kinda
yeasty
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
golden
more
than
an
ipa
the
flavor
on
the
other
hand
is
heartily
fruity
although
theres
a
big
warm
undertow
too
this
is
an
interesting
interpretation
of
style
fitting
neither
the
american
nor
british
stereotypes
again
id
almost
guess
this
as
a
belgian
ale
in
a
blind
taste
except
for
the
sturdy
furity
orange
blossom
mostly
body
quite
enjoyable
quite
different

very

ipa
not
overthetop
bitter
but
excellently
balanced
with
solid

bill
good
entry
into
the

market
for

while
i
prefer
aipas
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
english
style
but
it
was
not
altogether
without
some
aspects
that
reduced
its
drinkability
for
me
d
for
the
style
its
right
on
just
dont
have
any
preconceived
notions
of
what
youre
getting
worth
trying
ive
been
sitting
on
this
one
for
awhile
i
got
a
nice
loud
pop
when
i
removed
the
cork
pours
a

the

a

that
has
some
character

complexity
to
it
well
worh
a
try
d
good
beer
but
pretty
boring
if
you
are
used
to
west
coast
ipas
but
this
beer
has
its
own
thing
going
on
and
its
quite
quaffable
the
750ml
slid
down
the
gullet
with
ease
i
love
the
meantime
india
pale
ale
bottle
and
label
the
brewery
has
done
a
fantastic
job
with
packaging
and
has
come
close
to
putting
a
beer
into
that
package
that
measures
up
to
the
best
of
the
style
after
ridgeways
version
this
is
my
next
most
favorite
english
ipa
if
youre
looking
for
a
delicious
beer
than
wont
wreck
your
palate
for
the
rest
of
the
day
this
one
fills
the
bill
quite
nicely
good
stuff
notes
another
brew
that
grew
on
me
in
the
span
of
30
minutes
at
first
i
thought
it
was
average
but
as
time
went
on
the
subtleties
showed
their
face
i
cant
remember
every
having
an
ipa
as
dry
as
this
and
i
liked
that
factor
odd
malt
bill
is
the
only
detractor
although
i
can
see
alot
of
folks
digging
it
i
couldnt
get
into
that
part
of
the
beer
everything
else
was
excellent
drinks
easy
enough
for
the
abv
i
suspect
id
like
this
fresher
i
believe
more
lively
carbonation
would
bring
put
the
hop
profile
better
not
a
bad
epa
though
just
believe
this
bottleconditioned
beer
has
to
be
at
its
peak
to
bring
out
the
best
in
it
i
will
continue
to
seek
out
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
as
both
this
the
porter
were
pretty
tasty
imo
herbal
hop
bitterness
leads
things
off
and
transitions
into
a
mildly
sweet
and
slightly
acidic
state
finish
is
astringent
with
the
hops
reasserting
themselves
notes
of
tea
appear
towards
the
end
as
well
decent
slick
mouthfeel
at
first
though
the
bone
dryness
of
the
finish
is
offputting
overall
a
good
beer
though
i
prefer
an
american
ipa
this
fullbodied
ipa
is
thick
and
very
flavorful
definitely
one
of
the
better
english
ipas
i
have
tasted
at
a
modest
price
of
around
seven
dollars
for
a
25oz
bottle
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
as
odd
of
a
brew
this
is
it
definitely
has
its
perks
i
dig
this
beer
it
has
a
smooth
personality
it
would
be
easily
overshadowed
by
a
west
coast
hop
bomb
so
try
to
ignore
that
when
you
drink
it
it
definately
doesnt
have
the
punch
i
was
built
up
to
from
the
label
its
got
a
high
level
of
sophistication
that
makes
it
very
fun
to
drink
i
think
this
would
rock
from
a
cask
im
inspired
to
try
their
porter
now
cheers
d
wish
i
could
have
this
beer
every
day
but
the
price
and
availability
limit
that
option
if
you
see
it
buy
one
or
several
a
copper
color
slightly
cloudy
in
the
glass
with
a
inch
and
half
off
white
colored
head
forming
on
top
a
surprising
malt
aroma
hits
the
nose
at
the
start
then
after
each
following
scent
a
hop
aroma
gains
strength
with
citrus
and
earthy
aromas
a
twinge
of
alchol
is
present
in
the
scent
as
well
at
the
end
the
taste
starts
with
that
malt
flavor
that
gradually
gives
to
grapefruit
bitterness
of
the
hops
that
lingers
on
the
palate
a
heavier
fell
than
what
one
would
expect
the
feel
of
skim
milk
maybe
a
bad
example
but
it
does
have
some
weight
a
strong
ipa
particularly
for
and
english
style
one
this
beer
brings
more
hop
flavor
to
the
table
and
it
is
most
appreciated
d
okay
i
might
have
this
again
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
pay
for
it
a
very
nice
ipa
very
drinkable
and
one
ill
go
back
for
as
it
warmed
it
became
harder
to
drink
maybe
i
should
have
drank
faster
drinkable
well
i
finished
the
glass
not
that
great
to
my
sense
of
taste
drinkability
could
drink
these
all
day
if
not
for
the
rather
high
abv
speaking
of
the
abv
it
is
exceptionally
well
hidden
a
very
balanced
and
lipsmacking
beer
would
love
to
try
again
but
10
dollars
is
a
bit
steep
still
one
can
tell
greenwichmeantime
puts
a
lot
of
care
into
crafting
this
beer
and
it
shows
in
the
quality
of
the
brew
as
well
as
the
beautiful
presentation
a
nice
ale
like
i
said
but
i
could
have
spent
the
7
99
on
much
more
beer
per
volume
oh
well
ya
lives
ya
learns
drinkability

this
one
hit
the
mark
for
me
the
careful
balance
and
sessionstyle
flavors
make
this
a
real
treat
it
was
expensive
and
thats
too
bad
because
i
really
like
this
beer
but
probably
wont
repeat
the
purchase
because
of
the
price
i
do
have
a
slight
suspicion
that
maybe
the
bottle
was
bad
when
i
popped
the
cork
there
was
no
pop
i
basically
pulled
the
sucker
out
no
fanfare
at
all
might
be
the
reason
for
little
to
no
carbonation
feeling
drinkability
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
definite
session
beer
worth
picking
up
if
i
wanted
a
true
english
ipa
i
would
reach
for
this
everytime
my
personal
feeling
is
that
this
is
not
the
beer
to
quench
an
ipa
craving
unless
that
craving
is
for
an
english
ipa
tastes
good
but
not
good
enough
for
me
to
buy
again
those
are
my
personal
feelings
and
did
not
impact
the
overall
rating
recommended
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
ipa
but
scoring
it
is
a
bit
of
a
problem
as
the
lackluster
head
off
color
and
very
subdued
nose
detract
further
ipa
lovers
expecting
a
bold
hops
presence
arent
going
to
find
it
here
still
and
all
its
an
outstanding
beer
in
its
own
right
and
i
heartily
recommend
it
a
nice
enough
english
ipa
that
pulls
on
authentic
dna
but
i
honestly
feel
that
the
bottled
version
has
too
much
toffee
malt
and
sweetness
though
given
the
price
i
will
not
be
picking
this
one
up
again
pours
a
cloudy
golden
amber
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
retains
impressively
the
aroma
has
some
serious
english
hop
character
with
lemon
berry
floral
and
herbal
notes
along
with
some
cane
sugar
orange
marmalade
and
alcohol
incredibly
complex
the
flavor
also
has
some
serious
english
hop
character
with
notes
of
lemon
berry
herbs
flora
and
minerals
along
with
some
cane
sugar
sweetness
toasted
bread
fruity
esters
and
an
alcohol
wallop
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
drinkability
an
excellent
english
ipa
complex
and
authentic
wavz
im
not
sure
if
this
is
the
same
ber
that
other
reviewers
haveit
came
in
the
same
bottle
but
it
odd
that
i
had
no
head
on
this
beer
at
all
i
actually
commented
to
my
husband
that
it
had
no
carbonation
its
a
nice
lemonyamber
color
slightly
cloudy
in
appearance
theres
an
herbalcitrus
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
its
malty
enough
that
its
definitely
an
english
ipa
but
has
a
great
hop
flavor
that
balances
out
the
maltiness
is
it
drinkable
im
sure
that
if
it
was
a
little
more
carbonated
it
would
have
a
lot
more
pleasant
mouthfeel
md
softlycarbonated
and
very
creamy
on
the
mouthfeel
allowing
the
complex
flavour
profile
evolve
in
its
own
time
without
fizzy
interruption
the
fullbody
is
a
natural
result
of
7
5
alc
strength
but
never
heavy
compared
with
my
last
note
10
months
ago
this
bottle
seems
to
feature
more
maltiness
on
the
palate
and
more
profound
fragrance
on
the
nose
yet
the
aftertaste
of
bitter
and
tannic
hops
remains
very
impressive
indeed
fantastic
to
drink
this
is
a
great
english
ipa
its
just
not
as
bitter
as
i
was
expecting
rather
its
more
herbal
and
floral
with
a
strong
malt
base
i
thought
it
would
be
a
british
version
of
an
american
ipa
read
over
the
top
hops
still
good
though
it
was
alright
for
an
english
ipa
just
not
worth
the
nearly
10
price
tag
in
my
opinion
could
honestly
drink
this
all
day
smooth
as
a
ipa
can
be
very
good
other

this
is
a
great
beer
probably
the
best
americanesque
ipa
brewed
in
england
its
not
as
piny
or
citrusy
as
the
usual
american
ipa
but
theres
a
kinship
there

lovely

750ml
was
quickly
gone
copper
in

and
very
hazy
there
is
a
ton
of
sediment
in
this
beer
its
topped
by
a
fluffy
eggwhite
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
it
settles
the
head
shows
nice
retention
in
the
process
the
nose
is
all
noble
hops
very
floral
a
little
grassy
with
a
nice
citrus
back
there
is
a
touch
of
light
caramel
on
the
finish
the
flavor
is
a
wonderful
balance
of
hop
and
malt
more
of
herbal
quality
like
fresh
cut
hay
with
a
nice
citrus
lemon
bitterness
midway
through
the
drink
the
malt
does
show
with
a
nice
balancing
sweetness
a
little
caramel
and
green
apple
the
mouth
feel
is
slick
and
smooth
really
nice

i
think
this
is
a
marvelous

i
removed
the
cork
there
wasnt
much
of
a

so
i
was
a
bit
worried
it
could
be

it

a

interesting
to
see
an

designed

and
id
say
they
hit
their
mark
i
just
wish
it
werent
10
bucks
a
bottle
a
fantastic
english
big
bad
ipa
lots
of
flavour
and
worth
the
cash
im
happy
and
proud
that
an
english
brewery
is
making
such
a
big
bold
beer
great
drinking
such
a
big
beer
that
isnt
a
us
import
the
beer
came
in
an
elegant
looking
champagne
style
browngreen
bomber
with
the
information
about
the
beer
printed
on
contoured
labels
having
a
wire
cage
and
cork
added
to
the
overall
refinement
of
the
packaging
as
the
beer
relinquished
the
confinement
to
the
appointed
imperial
pint
glass
the
color
looked
golden
amber
the
body
slightly
hazy
carbonation
ample
and
head
well
proportioned
at
twofinger
thick
the
appearance
was
pretty
spot
on
for
an
ipa
from
either
side
of
the
atlantic
while
the
smell
was
that
of
signature
english
hops
the
restrained
spiciness
and
full
on
earthiness
of
the
hops
could
not
be
mistaken
for
anything
but
fuggles
golding
the
taste
indicated
that
the
hops
had
been
added
in
amounts
typically
absent
from
the
beers
brewed
over
there
it
wasnt
overly
bitter
but
it
was
certainly
spicy
and
snappy
there
was
also
a
good
deal
of
citric
acidity
that
makes
the
american
versions
of
the
style
so
quaffable
the
very
cohesive
flavor
profile
set
off
fireworks
in
my
mouth
with
each
sip
the
body
was
medium
thick
and
carbonation
soft
and
creamy
i
e
the
typical
ipa
mouthfeel
that
makes
me
long
for
the
next
sip
aftertaste
was
long
drawn
out
and
citric
kudos
to
meantime
for
incorporating
the
american
influences
so
well
while
keeping
the
beer
an
english
ipa
at
its
heart
will
have
to
pick
up
more
next
time
im
at
greens
this
beer
is
pleasing
to
drink
but
seemed
strong
as
i
had
it
i
probably
wouldnt
have
wanted
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
but
id
get
it
again
to
share
this
meantime
poured
a
slightly
dark
golden
color
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
of
off
white
head
that
leaves
light
lacing
you
can
smell
the
fruity
hops
and
the
malty
sweetness
almost
evenly
the
taste
starts
with
the
sweet
malt
but
citrus
hops
take
over
in
the
end
with
a
little
caramel
flavor
as
well
medium
bodied
with
only
slight
bitterness
from
the
hops
shouldnt
have
any
trouble
finishing
off
this
big
bottle
my
self
my
new
favorite
english
ipa
burning
forest
in
color
with
a
full
lofty
foam
fruit
cocktail
hop
aroma
peaches
apricot
pear
with
a
touch
of
floral
aromas
along
with
a
mildly
vibrant
sweet
malt
caramel
thing
going
on
in
the
nose
as
well
well
balanced
malt
and
hop
flavor
though
it
is
hop
accented
the
hops
are
still
fruity
just
like
the
aroma
but
they
also
seem
piney
and
resinous
as
well
definately
not
your
typical
english
medicinal
antibiotic
hop
flavor
which
some
american
brewers
seem
to
seize
but
rather
a
fresh
very
lively
and
fitting
hoppiness
the
malt
was
very
sweet
and
lingering
overall
i
found
it
very
tasty
750
ml
bottle
corked
and
caged
meantime
ipa
has
a
hazy
orange
topped
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
mainly
hops
with
citrus
and
herbal
qualities
bready
malt
flavor
with
lots
of
fruit
including
orange
and
pineapple
sweet
in
the
middle
but
the
finish
is
fairly
bitter
there
is
a
herbal
hop
flavor
that
i
didnt
like
at
first
but
it
grew
on
me
as
the
beer
warmed
creamy
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
it
was
by
no
means
a
difficult
task
to
finish
the
750
ml
bottle
on
my
own
its
a
bit
expensive
but
worth
it
wow
what
a
nice
bottle
presentation
poured
golden
and
hazy
great
smell
of
hops

definitely
not
an
american
ipa
but
the
british
ipa
with
use
of
fuggles
and
goldings
there
are
some
great
flavors
of
fresh
baked
bread
pear
jam
and
pineapples
crisp
clean
with
enough
body
and
alcohol
to
tell
you
this
is
a
serious
pale
ale
i
wish
i
had
seen
this
in

i
am

of
this

but
given
the
storage
situation
where
i
bought
it
that
may
be
part
of

above

head
fades
quite
slowly
and
light
delicate
lacing
is
prevalent
not
unlike
a
cask
ale
would
produce
aroma
is
balanced
yet
that
does
not
indicate
boring
as
hops
and
malt
sweetness
are
present
taste
is
also
casklike
to
my
tastebuds
with
sedate
grains
giving
way
to
ample
lightly
fruity
hoppiness
more
than
what
the
style
classification
would
lead
you
to
expect
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
superb
would
love
to
find
this
one
locally
perhaps
for
a
bit
cheaper
and
revisit
over
and
over
moouthfeel
first
pour
was
in
the
traditional
ipa
vein
of
dry
and
hoppy
as
far
as
the
palate
was
concerned
the
second
pour
was
a
rich
hop
and
malt
palate
that
this
beer
went
great
with
my
corned
beef

and
pickles
lunch
swimmingly
the
after

is
rich
in

sweet

and
a
citruslike
crispness
that
makes

the

a

owing
to
the
low

and
balanced
o
decent
but
not
exceptional
traditional
english
ipa
really
enjoyed
the
feel
and
balance
of
this
lot
of
bitterness
with
a
dryish
bubbly
feel
and
sweet
wet
malty
finish
overall
a
good
beer
not
the
best
ipa
ive
ever
had
but
a
good
six
pack
if
youre
looking
for
something
good
to
drink
while
grilling
or
to
share
with
some
friends
overall
pretty
good
pretty
thick
for
summer
drinking
though
o
i
literally
have
no
idea
what
to
think
of
this
brew
i
definitely
dont
think
its
in
the
same
league
as
some
of
schlaflys
other
ipas
namely
their
wonderful
tipa
but
after
sipping
it
for
a
while
it
grows
on
me
slightly
slightly
quash
some
of
the
acidic
qualities
and
this
would
become
a
genuinely
good
english
ipa
try
it
if
you
can
get
a
single
i
guess
this
english
style
ipa
has
a
cloudy
copper
hue
that
is
capped
by
a
soapy
thin
head
the
nose
is
very
subtle
in
bitterness
with
some
herbal
notes
but
it
has
more
barley
and
bran
grain
notes
the
flavor
is
very
barleyesque
heavy
on
dry
grain
malt
bran
flakes
and
a
bitter
herb
tone
the
feel
is
very
dry
crisp
and
a
bit
heavy
on
carbonation
i
understand
the
style
and
like
heavy
malts
but
this
seemed
to
rely
heavily
on
a
dry
bran
like
flavor
that
just
wasnt
my
favorite
as
the
finish
comes
quick
a
crisp
and
refreshing
taste
of
southern
sweet
tea
laced
with
freshpulled
fruity
tobacco
gives
final
impressions
along
with
the
classic
broad
grassy
and
woodish
bitterness
from
noble
english
hops
poured
an
orangetinted
amber
with
a
clinging
white
head
there
is
significant
detritus
floating
in
this
and
settling
to
the
bottom
a
real
negative
there
is
almost
no
aroma
or
flavor
even
as
it
warms
there
is
a
nice
weight
to
the
body
not
even
remotely
like
an
english
ipa
i
dont
know
what
happened
to
make
this
bottle
that
bad
o
decent
enough
but
when
they
put
out
stuff
like
their
tasmanian
ipa
it
is
hard
to
compete
rated
to
style
this
beer
delivers
just
as
advertised
woody
lemony
not
too
bitter
and
not
too
sweet
a
big
english
bitter
that
will
keep
you
sipping
while
trying
to
put
a
thumb
on
complex
flavors
o
a
really
solid
authentic
example
of
the
style
i
think
this
ale
serves
as
an
excellent
counterpoint
to
schlaflys
american
and
tasmanian
ipas
i
could
also
see
this
beer
being
used
to
illustrate
the
differences
between
english
and
american
takes
on
the
style
o
tasty
just
a
bit
sweet
for
my
palate
if
that
were
toned
down
the
hop
bill
increased
slightly
i
think
it
would
accent
the
citrusearthy
notes
even
better
or
perhaps
its
a
bit
late
past
its
bottling
date
i
like
this
drink
an
amped
up
english
ipa
done
very
well
glad
i
picked
it
up
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
overall
a
reallly
good
beer
from
schlafly
and
one
of
the
better
american
made
english
ipas
i
have
had
a
great
style
that
is
not
brewed
enough
o
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
make
of
this
at
first
as
it
is
an
unfamiliar
style
to
me
and
distinct
from
belgian
and
american
ipas
ive
had
it
had
a
textural
and
pastoral
flavor
and
aroma
that
i
warmed
to
quickly
overall
a
rather
enjoyable
brew
overall
with
a
good
dose
of
herbal
earthy
and
lemongrass
hop
flavors
taste
the
english
hops
dominate
they
are
spicy
and
bitter
with
a
touch
of
lemon
mildly
bitter
and
earthy
aftertaste
pours
a
clear
copper
color
13
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
citrus
hops
hops
sweet
malt
hint
of
yeast
hint
of
alcohol
hint
of
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
pine
fits
the
style
of
an
american
ipa
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
a
hint
of
grass
sweet
malt
hops
citrus
hint
of
yeast
slight
alcohol
hint
of
smoke
and
hint
of
floral
notes
overall
complex
body
and
aroma
smooth
and
well
blended
o
i
would
rate
this
a
little
lower
but
ive
had
it
on
tap
before
and
it
was
much
better
would
much
rather
drink
schlaflys
tipa
or
aipa
this
really
stands
out
as
an
exceptional
beer
from
this
brewery
for
me
it
tastes
more
like
an
english
hopped
american
ipa
for
me
as
it
has
that
light
body
of
a
west
coast
style
ipa
the
hops
used
are
extremely
interesting
with
this
strong
pop
of
lemon
and
light
citrus
instead
of
grapefruit
but
then
the
drying
being
later
of
herbs
and
grapefruit
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
in
body
with
mediumlow
levels
of
carbonation
that
lead
to
a
fairly
thick
chewy
mouthfeel
that
has
some
foamy
smoothness
to
it
as
well
closes
dry
with
substantial
stickiness
clinging
to
the
palate
and
lips
ofor
and
english
ipa
exactly
what
youd
expect
caramel
and
malt
to
begin
with
grass
mild
hops
notes
in
the
finish
thanks
to
kirk
for
the
beer
they
are
calling
this
one
xipa
now
as
part
of
that
new
ipa
series
this
is
a
standard
english
ipa
quite
heavy
and
not
as
good
as
some
of
their
other
ipa
work
at
schlafly
this
pours
a
rich
looking
bronze
color
with
a
creamy
and
robust
white
head
aromas
of
tired
english
caramel
malt
and
bittering
hops
in
equal
proportion
and
a
flavor
that
agrees
more
sweetness
from
the
grain
than
i
need
in
an
ipa
and
the
hops
come
across
a
little
astringent
the
beer
is
filling
as
a
result
even
though
the
texture
is
soft
and
delicate
and
the
carbonation
is
appropriately
light
true
to
style
i
think
a
cask
pour
would
do
wonders
for
this
but
as
it
stands
its
sort
of
unimpressive
a
beer
ive
had
before
and
forgotten
or
something
just
not
distinct
on
its
own
too
bog
to
pair
well
with
a
meal
its
sort
of
an
oddball
in
the
taproom
lineup
body
is
nice
and
crisp
but
also
smooth
and
velvety
overall
ive
had
this
once
before
and
enjoyed
it
very
much
i
dont
know
why
i
waited
years
to
finally
buy
it
in
bottles
and
finally
try
and
review
it
this
brew
is
worth
it
and
schlafly
continues
to
do
good
by
st
louis
beer
geeks
poured
into
a
snifter
from
the
bottle
the
beer
was
a
copper
color
with
a
white
head
a
slight
lacing
was
apparent
the
aroma
was
a
faint
grapefruit
aroma
leaning
more
toward
earthy
notes
the
initial
taste
was
a
sour
unrippened
grapefruit
big
hops
were
present
but
the
hops
were
more
tongue
bruising
than
tasty
in
some
ways
the
hops
were
almost
medicinelike
did
somebody
put
nyquil
in
my
ipa
there
was
no
real
sense
of
sweetness
or
citrus
as
part
of
the
hops
making
the
taste
onesided
on
close
observation
one
might
detect
the
malts
and
a
certain
biscuity
quality
that
allow
the
taste
to
linger
in
the
aftertaste
the
acidity
of
the
hops
becomes
more
harsh
while
this
has
the
texture
of
an
ipa
it
hardly
has
any
of
the
taste
characteristics
i
really
prefer
american
ipa
and
dont
care
much
for
their
english
counterpart
but
this
was
pretty
appropriate
for
the
style
not
sure
what
the
ibu
count
was
but
its
up
there
though
its
still
very
drinkable
ive
been
impressed
by
the
schlafly
brews
ive
tried
in
the
past
so
i
picked
up
this
sixer
for
ipa
day
it
looks
nice
enough
on
the
pour
a
nice
deep
amber
color
with
a
good
head
that
dissipated
over
the
first
few
minutes
of
drinking
smell
was
off
on
this
beer
for
an
ipa
it
reminded
more
of
macro
domestic
beers
than
any
ipa
ive
ever
smelled
it
had
a
stronger
malt
character
than
i
would
expect
from
an
ipa
the
taste
was
off
too
strong
malt
and
baked
bread
boozy
with
a
not
enjoyable
bitterness
to
it
overall
i
cant
say
this
will
be
a
beer
i
purchase
again
a
good
english
ipa
not
really
where
i
lean
to
in
the
ipa
world
neat
to
try
something
out
of
my
region
the
alcohol
is
here
but
not
noticeable
to
the
taste
this
reminded
me
of
a
strong
english
bitter
with
just
a
bit
more
hops
and
kick
to
it
fans
of
that
style
or
english
ipas
will
enjoy
this
take
by
schlafly
it
warmed
me
up
nicely
without
being
too
overpowering
and
served
as
a
welcome
refresher
from
domestic
versions
that
are
seemingly
involved
in
the
hop
arms
race
as
i
just
recently
found
myself
enjoying
ipas
i
cannot
offer
a
extensive
review
of
this
beer
i
up
to
now
have
been
devoted
to
stouts
and
porters
i
can
however
say
if
one
is
fond
of
the
schlafly
brand
and
ipas
rest
assure
they
will
find
this
beer
to
decent
pretty
good
english
ipa
if
you
were
expecting
a
traditional
american
ipa
you
might
be
disappointed
i
happened
to
think
it
was
more
of
an
esb
than
an
english
ipa
but
the
color
is
too
light
for
that
style
i
believe
anywho
this
is
a
pretty
good
demonstration
of
the
style
slightly
bitter
slightly
sweet
slightly
burnt
characters
overall
a
bit
average
tasting
for
me
but
the
style
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
in
general
o
a
nice
eipa
which
would
be
an
original
style
ipa
as
the
english
invented
the
ipa
ok
so
there
is
one
good
thing
that
came
from
war
alcohol
is
nicely
masked
for
7
2
flavors
are
in
line
with
what
i
would
think
the
original
ipas
were
english
pales
tend
to
have
a
bigger
malt
base
but
the
ipa
was
hopped
up
for
preservation
puropses
during
transport
negative
points
for
the
heavy
amount
of
sediment
present
i
would
have
this
beer
again
d
this
was
more
like
a
strong
heineken
than
a
good
ipa
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
the
scent
or
taste
the
body
was
ok
and
the
finish
was
ok
drinkable
but
not
very
enjoyable
not
recommended
12
ounce
bottle
bottled
on
3202012
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
is
good
and
theres
a
lot
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
brew
smells
like
herbal
hops
bready
malt
and
some
caramel
it
tastes
like
herbal
and
citrusy
grapefruit
hops
along
with
some
apricots
caramel
and
bready
malt
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
brew
id
buy
a
6
pack
of
this
the
next
time
i
come
across
it
its
a
nice
english
ipa
that
i
enjoyed
i
either
picked
this
up
at
party
town
or
liquor
barn
i
cant
remember
which
place
for
sure
mo
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
neutral
on
the
palate
but
maybe
leaves
it
a
touch
dry
finishes
semisweet
and
the
aftertaste
doesnt
linger
its
an
okay
beer
and
it
almost
tastes
like
it
is
past
freshness
which
is
odd
since
its
only
2
months
past
bottling
date
not
bad
for
the
style
but
there
are
better
options
out
there
imo
this
ipa
that
focuses
on
earthy
and
herbal
tones
with
a
slightly
sweet
and
bitter
finish
hangs
in
the
solidly
good
category
of
ipas
but
unlikely
to
ever
be
called
great
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
medium
white
lasting
head
some
lacing
aroma
and
taste
of
floral
citrus
hops
biscuit
malt
yeast
and
some
fruity
citrus
and
grapefruit
notes
a
medium
bodied
palate
with
good
carbonation
finishes
with
a
floral
citrus
hops
biscuit
malt
yeast
and
some
light
citrus
fruity
flavor
overall
a
good
ipa
for
the
style
taste
is
thick
and
sticky
on
the
palate
notably
with
the
pine
resiny
hops
character
finishes
with
a
malty
sweet
spiciness
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
and
a
pleasing
ipa
pours
copperorange
in
color
with
a
bubbly
offwhite
head
that
holds
good
retention
and
leaves
some
lacing
mainly
at
the
top
of
the
glass
the
downside
to
the
appearance
is
that
there
is
a
ton
of
yeast
particulate
suspended
in
the
body
of
the
ale
a
more
careful
pour
would
hopefully
have
left
it
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
unappealing
to
me
but
i
know
it
doesnt
bother
some
aroma
is
sweet
fruity
floral
hops
toasted
grain
and
caramel
malt
tastes
are
similar
to
the
aroma
with
some
pine
apricot
and
mango
to
boot
maybe
a
bit
more
bready
mouthfeel
is
thintomedium
moderate
carbonation
and
finishes
with
some
bitterness
but
is
very
well
balanced
overall
its
a
good
take
on
the
style
but
nothing
id
search
out
again
overall
fairly
disappointing
not
very
hop
forward
alcohol
wa
a
bit
obtrusive
i
liked
it
a
lot
better
from
a
bottle
a
year
or
two
ago
o
very
good
ipa
seems
to
be
very
in
line
with
the
english
ipa
style
the
first
of
this
ilk
ive
tried
nice
work
schlafly
o
ive
always
considered
schlafly
a
dark
horse
surprise
brewery
and
after
this
brew
i
still
do
d
from
what
i
understand
english
ipas
should
have
a
more
prominent
malt
component
and
this
brew
does
not
however
the
hop
character
is
rather
pleasant
and
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
overall
still
wins
for
me
probably
one
of
my
favorite
english
ipas
even
still
o
some
what
refreshing
but
im
not
overly
excited
about
this
one
aroma
was
a
fine
mixture
of
light
piney
hops
hints
of
fresh
grass
and
a
touch
of
tea
leaves
as
it
warms
this
carries
over
very
well
into
the
flavor
as
each
sip
starts
with
a
nice
bite
of
hops
which
quickly
mellow
into
a
fresh
meadow
like
flavor
with
light
earthy
tones
grasses
light
grains
and
a
smooth
light
and
dry
finish
d
as
long
as
youre
not
looking
for
an
alpha
hop
bomb
any
fan
of
pale
ales
and
english
ales
would
probably
find
something
to
enjoy
in
this
one
i
can
imagine
that
being
advertised
as
a
true
ipa
might
hurt
its
image
for
some
but
if
it
was
simply
marketed
as
a
regular
pale
ale
i
think
the
story
would
be
different
worth
a
drink
overall
just
an
ok
flavored
ipa
nothing
worthy
to
seek
out
again
overall
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
there
was
an
odd
sweetness
in
the
flavor
that
i
didnt
love
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
still
really
like
this
brewery
mouthfeeloverall
somewhere
between
a
medium
and
a
light
body
with
crisp
carbonation
bright
orange
color
with
white
foam
lots
of
sediment
in
bottom
of
glass
slightly
sweet
citrus
aroma
malty
with
a
citrusy
hop
finish
very
creamy
mouthfeel
subdued
hop
taste
for
an
ipa
deceptively
high
alcohol
content
this
is
very
good
with
a
meal
of
cold
cuts
cheese
and
crackers
o
goes
down
easily
tasty
somewhat
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
was
a
bit
heavy
on
the
alcohol
although
decently
done
its
a
one
and
done
for
me
schlaflys
export
ipa
is
solid
certainly
the
best
shlafley
product
ive
tried
bright
bold
and
bitter
the
ipa
is
dry
and
finished
slow
as
the
hops
do
their
thing
the
flavor
unwound
slowly
and
brought
it
all
together
nicely
balanced
o
i
thought
this
beer
was
good
but
could
have
been
better
coming
from
this
brewery
with
this
being
an
english
ipa
i
still
expected
the
hops
to
come
out
a
little
more
than
what
they
did
it
wasnt
bad
at
all
just
a
little
above
lackluster
the
abv
was
well
hidden
enough
that
it
crept
only
around
in
the
ending
which
i
liked
overall
meh
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
id
drink
it
but
i
likely
wont
be
buying
it
again
schlafly
definitely
has
better
offerings
out
there
so
theyre
still
definitely
cool
with
me
this
just
isnt
one
of
their
hits
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
a
little
hot
not
a
bad
beer
but
id
expect
a
little
more
flavor
from
an
8
beer
quite
good
give
it
a
go
o
this
is
my
first
english
ipa
and
it
is
quite
a
different
taste
than
the
american
ipas
i
am
used
to
the
full
bodied
caramel
malt
backbone
carries
the
hops
well
into
the
finish
the
hop
bitterness
is
not
front
and
center
initially
smooth
alcohol
character
with
minimal
alcohol
warming
i
think
they
did
a
great
job
controlling
the
hot
fusel
alcohols
during
fermentation
overall
a
great
beer
but
i
wish
it
was
filtered
bright
o
great
epa
could
be
a
part
of
introduction
of
people
to
ipa
and
epa
great
session
beer
but
pricing
is
a
little
steep
for
a
session
ale
bottle
to
frosty
pint
the
beer
would
have
been
average
in
appearance
but
i
was
disappointed
to
see
particles
of
sediment
in
it
smell
was
pretty
plain
hops
were
present
taste
was
alright
but
not
everything
id
hoped
it
would
be
the
hops
are
there
but
theyre
balanced
in
typical
english
fashion
mouthfeel
is
slightly
above
average
overall
its
an
okay
beer
that
i
might
drink
again
but
i
wont
be
buying
a
nicely
drinkable
english
ipa
definitely
worthy
of
a
sampling
medium
body
with
a
slightly
lower
feel
in
carbonation
not
much
alcohol
felt
here
making
it
pretty
drinkable
a
nice
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
english
ipas
are
always
interesting
color
is
enticing
golden
yellow
with
a
slightly
off
white
one
finger
head
pale
malts
lead
the
charge
on
the
nose
with
a
sweet
aroma
some
bitter
hops
follow
with
a
slight
grassy
piney
flair
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
hops
are
noticeable
on
the
finish
with
some
pine
flavor
smooth
feel
with
some
alcohol
warming
along
with
a
slight
hop
oiliness
overall
a
very
tasty
india
pale
ale
definitely
a
good
example
of
the
style
from
schlafly
overall
its
pretty
average
but
ill
happily
drink
this
one
again
schlaflys
usually
quite
good
and
this
one
is
decent
but
it
isnt
one
of
their
better
creations
o
good
stuff
goes
down
easy
and
no
problem
drinking
a
few
with
out
even
trying
a
good
english
ipa
that
is
laid
back
and
not
an
inyourface
style
o
pretty
drinkable
as
it
well
balanced
between
hops
and
malt
also
the
8abv
is
hardly
noticable
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
might
buy
another
single
of
but
cant
see
myself
buying
an
entire
6
pack
as
far
as
im
concerned
it
just
does
not
get
any
better
than
a
fresh
ipa
on
a
warm
spring
day
and
this
beer
delivers
i
was
really
excited
to
try
an
ipa
styled
after
the
original
english
versions
i
was
not
disappointed
a
must
try
for
any
hop
head
sure
to
gain
a
lot
of
fans
in
the
st
louis
area
o
hm
its
really
hard
to
judge
this
beer
its
certainly
worth
a
try
schlafly
definitely
brewed
it
well
but
i
cant
say
ive
had
anything
quite
like
it
before
maybe
it
will
grow
on
me
in
the
future
as
the
second
one
certainly
seemed
more
inviting
than
the
first
either
way
it
was
a
good
way
to
end
the
night
these
guys
have
made
some
far
better
beers
and
even
better
ipas
i
like
this
one
though
it
is
bold
and
completely
interesting
but
far
short
of
being
exceptional
above
average
carbonation
thanks
for
the
opportunity
this
brew
is
just
a
little
too
carbonated
for
the
style
and
not
as
smooth
as
most
british
brands
its
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
with
a
high
abv
content
id
drink
this
one
again
for
sure
overall
this
is
more
like
an
english
pale
ale
instead
of
ipa
decent
but
nothing
exciting
well
done
overall
a
nice
beer
obviously
different
than
an
american
ipa
and
has
a
nice
english
ipa
flavor
d
very
nice
beer
but
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
a
niceenough
beer
hanging
in
the
balance
between
a
strict
interpretation
of
the
ipa
brewed
for
shipment
to
the
far
reaches
of
the
british
empire
and
a
bit
of
americanized
tweaking
of
the
hops
big
malt
body
true
to
style
hopping
was
firm
and
wellbalanced
but
seemed
a
bit
more
apa
in
profile
alcohol
was
well
integrated
in
the
flavor
profile
for
all
the
positive
attributes
of
the
beer
however
it
just
didnt
ever
seem
to
find
the

a

heavy
for
me
d
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
i
have
had
as
of
late
this
is
a
style
that
for
the
most
part
just
does
not
work
if
made
in

this
one

i

ill
make
an
exception
for

booze

collide
nicely

pallet
i
dont

i
could
handle
more

it
pours
an
orange
tinted
gold
that
is
just
about
the
haziest
beer
ive
ever
poured
i
dont
think
its
yeast
just
precipitated
proteins
from
the
high
alcohol
and
hopping
the
aroma
is
like
a
very
malt
like
a
toasted
cracker
with
floral
and
tropical
fruit
perfume
that
hit
hard
in
the
end
the
beer
is
smoothly
bitter
with
a
lot
of
toasted
malt
flavor
yeasty
fruitiness
and
a
honeyed
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
the
alcohol
presence
makes
does
numb
and
dry
the
tongue
a
bit
i
love
ipas
and
really
enjoyed
this
one
this
beer
has
a
nice
balance
of
crisp
hoppiness
without
being
too
long
and
bitter
on
the
finish
i
paired
this
beer
with
a
chicken
stirfry
and
was
happy
with
the
complementing
flavors
it
matches
pretty
well
with
garlic
and
ginger
a
off
a
hard

is
a
thin

drinks

the

would
love
to
try
this
fresher
or
on
cask
for
what
i
bet
would
be
even
more
enjoyment
well
done
schafly
kind
of
a
hard
beer
to
pinpoint
light
golden
pour
with
a
little
head
smell
was
a
light
bready
smell
it
has
a
hoppy
dry
taste
to
it
that
finishes
sweet
and
dry
a
bit
bitter
i
found
this
interesting
and
glad
i
had
it
its
just
not
the
most
drinkable
because
of
the
flavor
and
being
8
it
needs
to
taste
a
little
smoother
to
put
down
a
few
d
drinking
this
beer
is
a
breeze
and
any
presence
of
alcohol
in
the
smell
and
taste
is
very
well
hidden
nice
interpretation
not
sure
where
a
got
the
bubblegum
d
actually
pretty
easy
to
get
down
could
do
another
but
i
didnt
care
enough
for
the
taste
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
i
find
especially
refreshing
draintime
i
could
learn
to
love
it
as
a
oneoff
homebrew
batch
that
pride
forced
me
to
finish
off
and
throw
out
the
recipe
but
i
wont
pay
money
for
this
d
a
pint
at
a
time
is
plenty
but
a
nice
ipa
all
be
it
an
english
ipa
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
crisp
drinkability
is
good
no
hint
of
alcohol
the
8
is
transparent
you
could
drink
this
until
the
inevitable
happens
good
one
excellent
beer
overall
i
am
glad
i
took
a
chance
with
this
beer
i
think
most
of
the
lower
scores
such
as
mine
are
attributed
to
the
english
style
ipa
as
most
of
us
are
used
to
the
american
style
it
is
something
i
can
get
used
to
and
would
buy
this
again
especially
at
the
price
i
got
it
for
d
i
prefer
ipas
made
with
different
hops
i
wonder
if
this
was
even
dry
hopped
or
not
i
definately
get
the
hops
in
the
flavor
but
the
aroma
leaves
a
little
something
to
be
desired
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
however
there
is
so
much
out
there
right
now
in
the
ipa
catergory
and
this
doesnt
stand
out
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
for
an
8
ipa
well
worth
a
try
tastes
like
it
smells
wonderful
balance
medium
boldness
cake
and
cookie
sweetness
backed
up
with
spicy
and
dry
hops
and
a
butter
toffee
explosion
near
the
end
mouthfeel
is
slightly
resiny
and
medium
bodied
easily
my
favorite
english
ipa
i
have
had
thus
far
the
balance
of
this
beer
makes
it
an
easy

full

and
nicely
flavorful
almost
tastes
like
an
old
ale
or
a
lite
barley
wine
which
i
suppose
is
a
compliment
and
means
that
this
is
a
flavorful
and
moderatly
complex
brit
style
ale
well
done
enjoyable
night
capper
for
me
this
was
an
interesting
beer
quite
strange
combination
of
flavors
that
ended
up
being
pretty
tasty
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
english
style
ipas
if
you
only
like
american
ipas
you
most
likely
wont
enjoy
this
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
quarter
inch
head
cream

color
forms
on
top
then
gradually
dissolving
away
surprising
strong
bready
and
malty
fragrance
at
the
front
of
each
scent
which
is
soon
followed
by
a
citrus
and
pine
aroma
the
taste
starts
with
a
hearty
bread
flavor
staying
there
for
some
time
then
it
all
blends
to
a
grassy
citrus
and
pine
flavors
that
take
over
and
lingers
for
several
minutes
a
medium
bodied
feel
staying
consistent
all
the
way
through
never
thinning
out
a
very
solid
ipa
with
a
strong
malty
heartiness
and
a
strong
hoppy
flavor
along
with
the
consistent
feel
make
this
a
good
choice
anytime
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
overcarbonated
for
my
taste
but
typically
oily
and
lasting
in
the
finish
drinks
fairly
easy
but
more
than
a
couple
is
definitely
out
of
the
question
not
a
bad
beer
but
underwhelming
non
the
less
easy
enough
to
drink
but
probably
something
ill
never
reach
for
again
with
many
options
availble
conclusion
from
a
brewery
that
does
some
amazing
stuff
this
is
fairly
mediocre
and
probably
one
i
wont
be
going
back
to
often
i
think
ill
keep
a
couple
in
the
cellar
though
and
see
if
a
bit
of
age
mellows
em
out
at
all
a
very
nice
little
brew
that
seems
very
true
to
style
hoppy
but
not
overly
so
rather
nice
for
a
change
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
tiny
almost
prickling
bubbles
on
top
of
a
creamy
base
drying
effect
in
the
finish
furthered
perhaps
by
the
considerable
bitterness
makes
me
want
another
sip
to
quench
my
thirst
somewhat
heavy
but
at
8
and
with
a
considerable
malt
backbone
im
not
surprised
nor
does
this
seem
entirely
inappropriate
holy
cow
whats
goin
on
with
this
colors
rosy
amber
consistency
is
lighter
heads
light
and
lacy
flavor
is
whole

is
a
subtle
term
fruity
herbaceous
reminds
me
of
a
badass
cali
syrah
for
all
you
wine
freaks
out
there
who
are
into
beer
this
guy
is
something
to
bend
your
brain
around
thanks
to
rob
for
bringing
this
back
from
the
midwest
to
boone
schlafly
is
definitely
on
my
radar
now
i
dont
really
have
much
else
to
say
about
this
beer
aside
from
hoping
i
got
a
bad
bottle
and
my
next
one
will
surprise
me
and
be
all
i
hoped
for
d
hopheads
are
going
to
look
for
something
else
after
a
snifter
of
this
one
that
said
this
truly
is
a
centeroftheroad
ipa
worth
the
time
if
you
ever
come
across
it
not
spectacular
but
pleasant
i
think
pleasant
is
the
word
for
this
beer
pleasant
and
enjoyable
perfectly
serviceable
cheers
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
sneaky
for
an
8
abv
it
drank
very
easily
and
i
could
have
had
a
few
more
with
no
problem
the
beer
feels
a
little
thick
on
the
tongue
ive
never
had
an
ipa
that
had
this
little
hop
character
very
smooth
as
a
result
of
its
lighter
body
d
easy
to
drink
and
a
decent
english
ipa
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
it
had
a
nice
clear
brown
color
and
an
ample
head
i
did
not
catch
much
of
an
aroma
from
this
but
my
allergies
have
been
bad
and
that
may
have
been
a
factor
i
really
liked
the
body
on
this
it
was
full
and
effervescent
nice
flavor
very
earthy
there
is
distinct
hop
bitterness
but
not
in
a
bold
manner
slight
alcohol
taste
but
quite
drinkable
there
was
also
a
mild
oiliness
to
the
texture
id
have
to
put
this
ipa
on
the
same
comparable
plane
as
that
of
sierra
nevada
and
sam
adams
perhaps
this
is
what
people
want
and
im
simply
looking
for
something
more
power
packed
i
sort
of
expect
it
from
an
ipa
but
perhaps
what
i
desire
is
more
a
double
ipa
rather
than
a
traditional
still
goose
island
has
produces
and
ipa
i
consider
better
than
the
schlafly
offering
for
an
8
imperial
ipa
it
goes
down
very
easily
the
size
is
well
disguised
and
someone
unaware
could
end
up
sessioning
this
gal
and
getting
loaded
cloudy
pale
gold
with
big
white
head
that
laces
down
the
mug
nicely
bold
spicy
bitter
taste
with
sweet
chewy
malt
balancing
and
alcohol
on
the
finish
goes
down
smooth
with
a
full
bodied
taste
this
is
a
heavyweight
in
the
category
very
good
but
11
99six
not
something
i
would
run
out
to
buy
again
d
im
enjoying
this
i
think
id
drink
another
if
i
had
one
on
hand
my
tasting
of
this
beer
probably
suffered
from
the
constant
eye
treatment
i
kept
giving
it
really
the
looks
were
spot
on
for
the
style
perfect
like
trying
to
talk
to
a
beautiful
woman
it
was
hard
to
keep
focused
this
brewery
goes
on
my
to
visit
list
d
outstanding
beer
first
ive
had
from
this
brewery
and
if
i
could
get
them
in
jersey
theyd
have
me
sold
i
dont
think
it
is
the
role
model
of
an
english
ipa
but
one
tasty
hoppy
beer

golden
orange
with
a
long
lasting
froathy
white
head
intial
smell
comes
off
piney
with
aromas
of
bitter
and
hops
the
taste
is
moderately
hoppy
with
a
lingering
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
light
smooth
and
sports
a
mellow
carbonation
overall
drinkability
is
good
for
the
most
part
its
light
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
dislike
the
lingering
bitterness
but
that
fades
as
beer
gets
to
the
bottom
a
decent
pick
if
i
was
looking
for
a
lightly
hopped
beer
but
ultimately
not
a
go
to
choice
for
fulfilling
a
hop
craving
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
new
belgium
globe
this
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
nice
sticky
lacing
that
clings
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
tangerines
a
bit
of
pine
and
just
a
hint
of
malt
the
taste
reminds
me
a
water
downed
orange
juice
with
just
a
hint
boozy
goodness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
the
bitterness
doesnt
linger
the
way
most
ipas
do
its
drinkability
is
good
but
i
think
that
they
could
have
amped
up
the
body
as
they
took
the
abv
to
8
taste
has
some
earthy
hop

lots

would
be

beer
if
it
were
available
to
me
locally
drinkability
i
wouldnt
mind
if
the
abv
were
toned
down
a
notch
but
this
is
a
fine
brew
nonetheless
huge
hops
in
the
taste
wasnt
expecting
that
from
the
smell
nice
bittering
and
nice
in
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
good
ipa
decently
priced
and
good
good
things
are
coming
out
of
schafly
my
initial
thought
is
how
nice
the
beer
looks
a
slightly
cloudy
radiant
orange
sits
below
its
hardtodissipate
head
little
to
no
carbonation
bubbles
here
the
scent
is
full
of
oaky
malty
earthy
elements
this
beer
actually
reminds
me
of
the
smell
of
a
chardonnay
whoa
on
the
initial
hops
flavor
i
thought
it
was
supposed
to
mimic
an
english
ipa
that
one
really
hits
hard
right
away
nice
strong
malt
flavor
as
well
not
dry
at
all
for
an
ipa
this
has
a
pretty
substantial
malty
flavor
great
texture
on
the
tongue
as
well
slightly
heavy
but
really
smooth
and
frothy
absolutely
the
kind
of
beer
you
want
to
pack
your
fridge
or
cooler
full
of
d
pretty
damned
good
beer
the
creaminess
is
quite
impressive
and
really
adds
to
the
appeal
of
this
brew
very
nice
and
no
hint
of
that
8
abv
pick
em
up
and
slam
em
down
overall
its
a
good
tasting
ipa
that
is
quite
drinkable
mouthfeel
was
prickly
at
first
but
ended
smooth
medium
bodied
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
a
beautiful
head
smells
of
pine
and
grapefruit
common
of
its
style
as
well
as
sweet
bread
and
a
touch
of
malts
starts
off
with
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
which
is
followed
by
a
grapefruit
hoppy
taste
and
a
tad
bit
of
bitterness
this
is
a
great
ipa
it
is
not
as
over
the
top
as
many
can
be
and
the
bitterness
that
is
usually
associated
with
ipas
is
not
overly
present
too
bad
this
is
only
seasonal
for
schlafly
because
it
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
by
them
another
excellent
schlafly
ale
im
really
starting
to
trust
these
folks
to
turn
out
high
quality
potables
poured
out
of
bottle
into
a
new
belgum
snifter
type
glass
didnt
pour
too
aggressive
pours
a
nice
copper
color
got
about
1
finger
of
head
which
lingered
around
for
most
of
the
beer
leaving
a
bit
of
lacing
behind
with
each
sip
i
smelled
pine
needles
and
a
bit
of
hop
initially
but
i
should
have
let
it
warm
a
bit
before
pouring
it
was
bitter
tasting
at
first
with
a
touch
of
caramel
but
it
opened
up
quite
a
bit
as
it
as
the
drink
went
on
i
could
taste
the
hop
and
a
touch
of
citrus
it
seemed
to
get
smoother
as
it
warmed
in
the
glass
i
was
surprised
at
how
smooth
it
went
down
from
beginning
to
end
at
8
abv
this
could
be
a
dangerous
beer
for
me
pours
a
bright
slightly
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
big
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
lingers
for
a
while
leaving
some
impressive
lacing
smell
is
big
on
citrus
and
floral
hops
up
front
with
oranges
lemons
and
grapefruit
with
a
mild
bready
malt
aroma
in
the
background
taste
is
also
dominated
by
the
big
citrus
hops
with
mainly
grapefruit
in
the
taste
definitely
bitter
and
hoppy
in
very
nice
way
the
malt
background
balances
everything
nicely
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
prickly
with
hop
oil
with
strong
carbonation
to
tingle
the
tongue
this
a
very
good
beer
and
certainly
not
what
i
expected
when
i
saw
english
ipa
on
the
bottle
nice
english
style
ipavery
quaffable
for
such
a
high
alcohol
ale
d
not
a
westcoast
hop
bomb
but
it
is
an
english
ipa
it
really
gets
better
just
above
the
temperature
of
the
refridgerator
when
the
real
flavor
and
aroma
can
show
themselves
at
8
abv
with
how
delicious
this
is
seems
like
a
dangerous
combination
i
recommend
anyone
in
the
midwestor
elsewhere
if
you
can
find
it
to
check
this
brew
out
medium
bodied
and
smooth
goes
down
real
easy
and
uberrefreshing
i
dont
believe
this
is
8
as
it
drinks
as
easily
as
a
bitter
a
session
beer
that
you
would
have
to
watch
yourself
with
highly
recommended
schlafly
export
ipa
is
one
of
the
schlafly
springsummer
seasonal
beers
i
poured
it
from
the
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
after
allowing
it
to
warm
to
55
it
developed
34
fingers
of
white
frothy
head
with
lots
of
retention
and
a
fruity
nose
the
color
is
a
dark
honey
this
beer
is
bitter
but
with
a
nice
balance
of
malt
it
is
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
some
carbonation
felt
on
the
tongue
the
bitterness
is
pleasant
and
lasts
through
the
finish
but
doesnt
really
linger
after
that
for
an
8
abv
beer
the
alcohol
is
not
really
noticeable
just
a
bit
of
warmth
at
the
finish
the
beer
is
tasty
and
well
balanced
i
wish
this
wasnt
a
seasonal
beer
because
i
could
drink
it
year
round
drinkability
is
moderate
to
high
alcohol
is
pushing
the
high
side
but
flavors
are
good
i
could
handle
another

who
sent
me
two
more
of
these
to
enjoy
this
beer
is
a
clear
yellowgolden
color
with
a
thick
creamy
head
the
lacing
is
persistent
the
aroma
is
initially
strong
of
fresh
hop
very
inviting
it
fades
to
some
fruit
and
floral
notes
but
the
hops
remain
the
taste
is
bitter
and
fresh
with
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
very
well
suited
this
is
an
impressive
ipa
bold
flavors
but
not
overpowering
and
well
balanced
one
of
schlaflys
better
beers
not
a
bad
way
to
celebrate
my
one
year
anniversary
with
ba
hard
to
describe
a
beer
thats
so
wonderfully
balanced
but
believe
me
this
is
something
special
up
there
with
the
coffee
stout
as
my
favorite
schlafly

i
have
enjoyed
more
thanks
again
ethan
for
all
the
wonderful
brews
you
let
me
try
fuzzy
orange
in

quite
the
hop
aroma
going
onsays
fresh
cut
grass
great
malty
flavor
with
a
huge
backdrop
of
hops
very
well
balanced
between
sweet
and
bitter
good
mouthfeel
very
good
beer
and
very
very
drinkable
an
easy
going
down
8
its
almost
scary
seems
more
like
a
us
version
but
who
cares
great
beer
pours
a
nice
semicloudy
golden
amber
with
a
tenacious
white
head
evocative
hop
aroma
featuring
some
earthy
english
style
notes
and
some
elements
such
as
the
tropical
fruits
that
seem
derived
from
american
hops
juicy
malts
come
up
first
on
the
palate
they
are
joined
by
juicy
fruits
of
multiple
sources
citrus
tropical
stone
fruits
bitterness
grows
at
the
midpalate
but
crescendoes
quickly
leading
to
a
smooth
teabitternessandnuttymalts
finish
that
finish
is
long
and
active
mouthfeel
is
pretty
much
perfect
rounded
juicy
and
brisk
but
not
over
the
top
in
any
way
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
an
ipa
that
is
drinkable
and
has
plenty
of
hop
character
in
spite
of
not
being
a
hopbomb
drinkability
another
decent
brew
from
schlafly

straightforward
quite
easy

nice
to
look
at
this

has
many
pluses

few

definitely
have
it
again

pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
decent
slightly
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
the
nose
is
all
about
herbal
hops
and
a
sweet
malt
accent
underneath
smells
of
fresh
juicy
hops
the
palate
is
really
quite
nice
a
fine
balance
between
a
solid
malty
backbone
and
alive
with
hop
flavors
this
is
a
wellcrafted
beer
finishes
quite
lively
and
dry
ample
carbonation
mouth
feel
is
mediumlight
and
comes
across
as
light
enough
on
the
palate
a
very
nice
beer
maltier
than
an
american
style
ipa
yet
not
as
malty
as

here
schlaflys
is
one
of
my
favorite
craft
brewers
being
the
only
one
in
my
region
of
the
country
i
could
be
biased
however
sixpack
was
gone
pretty
fast
an
easy
drinker
to
be
sure
quite
tasty
i
would
certainly
drink
again
overall
a
good
ipa
but
perhaps
more
citrus
hoppy
than
the
traditional
english
style
should
be
not
quite
as
good
as
goose
island
or
dogfish
head
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
ipa
it
seemed
fairly
true
to
the
english
style
it
wasnt
overy
powerful
in
terms
of
hops
bottled
on
april
30
2007
received
this
bottle
from
bort11
served
slightly
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
from
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
poured
a
light
golden
copper
color
that
was
somewhat
hazy
about
two
fingers
of
thick
tight
bubbly
head
formed
in
the
glass
retention
was
decent
and
left
some
thick
sticky
lace
behind
tons
of
small
bubbles
of
carbonation
were
noticed
quickly
rising
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smell
strong
aromas
of
grapefruit
orange
peel
lemon
zest
a
nice
bready
yeast
and
nice
thick
malt
maybe
a
little
bit
peppery
and
spicy
in
the
nose
i
really
enjoyed
the
nose
more
than
the
flavors
but
not
too
bad
sweet
malts
semi
bitter
hops
some
citrus
noted
a
strong
almost
overpowering
grainy
flavor
in
the
finish
pretty
decent
balance
to
this
one
mouthfeel
had
a
nice
medium
bodied
feel
to
it
that
was
sticky
and
bitter
drinkability
was
pretty
good
high
drinkability
except
for
the
fact
you
can
only
get
this
near
or
in
st
louis
this
is
a
nice
ipa
balance
is
dead
on
chewy
toffee
and
caramel
induced
malt
with
a
toasty
mid
palate
lead
into
the
ripe
resiny
effervescent

flavors
start
and
finish
very
floral
not
overly
bitter
orange
peel
and
lemon
with
dried

pine

aspects
with
that
resiny
spectrum
a
very
find
example
of
the
style
long
finish
easy
drinking
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
body
and
very
clean
very
refreshing
and
quaffable

though
the

puts
it
out

the
session
category
schlafly
is
shining
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
bottled
on
43007
this
ipa
poured
a
hazy
copper
orange
color
with
a
thick
bubbly
beige
head
that
faded
quickly
some
excellent
lacing
was
left
behind
the
aroma
is
fairly
laid
back
for
an
ipa
with
this
high
of
an
alcohol
content
some
citrus
hop
notes
are
present
along
with
a
bit
of
caramel
the
flavor
is
lead
by
sweet
malts
then
some
light
hop
bitterness
a
touch
of
alcohol
is
noticable
but
not
overwhelming
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
resiny
with
a
good
dose
of
carbonation
somewhere
between
medium
to
fullbodied
this
ipa
is
all
about
balance
but
it
doesnt
do
much
to
set
itself
apart
from
the
crowd
tons
of
woody
and
vineous
hops
in
the
aroma
which
dont
diminish
at
all
in
the
quaff
massive
amount
of
hoppy
goodness
in
this
one
very
crisp
and
dry
almost
stinging
in
the
body
no
hint
of
a
8
undertow
this
beer
rates
well
as
a
sippin
summertime
special
glad
i
have
a
sixer
more
will
be
consumed
as
the
days
grow
longer
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
the
finest
beers
to
come
from
schlafly
sure
im
partial
to
ipas
but
this
one
can
hold
its
own
now
if
youll
excuse
me
i
have
a
six
pack
to
finish
on
to
the
taste
first
up
on
the
palate
is
a
rush
of
fresh
resinous
hops
there
is
a
touch
of
pine
along
with
some
more
of
the
grapefruit
noted
in
the
aroma
and
some
fresh
pineapple
a
strong
malt
backbone
helps
really
balance
this
beer
out
in
the
finish
with
some
nice
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
pretty
full
bodied
and
is
very
smooth
and
well
carbonated
the
8
abv
is
very
well
hidden
and
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
this
is
an
awesome
beer
from
schlafly
i
really
wish
they
would
brew
this
year
round
and
make
it
a
part
of
their
regular
rotation
the
beer
was
bottle
only
ten
days
ago
and
i
am
on
my
second
sixer
already
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
12
oz
bottle
poured
in
a
stemmed
wine
glass
drinkable
ipa
this
was
just
one
month
old
but
the
hops
were
not
suitably
strong
enough
to
warrant
calling
this
an
ipa
i
get
a
mixture
of
lemon
and
a
light
herbal
note
that
compliments
a
sweet
caramel
body
some
rose
petal
and
a
ribbon
of
floral
perfume
coasts
through
this
is
weak
and
cheap
but
at
1
a
bottle
thats
to
be
expected
i
found
this
off
style
but
with
enough
flavor
to
warrant
a
try
not
great
not
that
bad
though
this
cheap
ipa
gets
a
almost
3
overall
rating
only
because
it
connects
to
a
pabst
skunkiness
that
i
have
a
weak
spot
for
nostalgia
aside
the
carmel
color
and
drinkability
of
this
decently
heavy
ipa
is
a
good
cheap
option
the
fda
should
have
a
rule
that
a
label
cannot
say
ipa
unless
hops
have
actually
touched
liquid
glad
i
bought
one
bottle
instead
of
a
whole
6pack
at
trader
joes
possibly
the
recipe
changed
abv
is
5
7
and
color
is
closer
to
brown
than
to
bronze
or
copper
in
previous
reviews
no
trace
of
federal
jack
on
the
label
and
it
says
brewed
in
portland
me
not
kennebunkport
definitely
not
worth
6
a
sixpack
when
mission
street
ipa
is
the
same
price
with
my
limited
experience
judging
beer
i
have
a
hard
time
understanding
some
of
the
reviews
here
folks
go
into
a
lot
of
detail
about
things
that
i
dont
make
out
like
caramel
and
malty
taste
factors
and
grassy
hop
smell
i
can
tell
that
there
are
hops
in
this
brew
and
that
it
has
a
crisp
refreshing
taste
and
someone
said
that
the
finish
is
dry
i
agree
the
head
is
light
and
lacing
is
minimal
but
when
all
is
said
and
done
theres
still
a
wee
bit
left
torpedo
blows
this
brew
out
of
the
water
but
its
a
good
beer
and
as
of
this
review
will
be
my
standard
of
comparison
for
a
good
average
brew
3
points
across
the
board
im
reporting
on
a
12
oz
bottle
from
trader
joses
with
a
freshness
date
of
june
2015
d
o
cant
get
past
the
sourness
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
beer
rate
so
poorly
i
flew
in
from
ca
and
was
treated
by
one
of
these
beers
which
was
purchased
at
trader
joes
i
am
always
hesitant
to
buy
or
drink
beer
from
a
discount
beer
place
especially
a
place
that
doesnt
store
beer
the
correct
way
the
beer
was
nothing
outstanding
but
i
did
not
detect
any
crazy
off
flavors
or
anything
unpleasant
the
one
thing
i
didnt
like
is
that
this
beer
comes
off
more
like
a
pale
ale
than
an
ipa
low
hop
aroma
and
flavor
not
a
very
bitter
beer
and
not
the
most
abv
this
beer
doesnt
even
top
5
7
the
one
thing
i
liked
about
this
beer
is
the
easy
drinking
qualities
this
beer
had
i
had
several
and
was
not
sluring
my
words
and
the
beer
tasted
just
fine
if
someone
passed
me
this
beer
in
a
glass
and
told
me
nothing
about
it
i
would
not
even
have
a
single
complaint
its
drinkable
but
kind
of
blah
and
not
very
ipalike
all
that
being
said
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
tho
not
outstanding
its
plenty
drinkable
when
into
trader
joes
to
get
a
six
it
was
sandwiched
in
between
a
bunch
of
good
beers
i
knew
well
but
were
about
89
dollars
a
six
went
for
the
bargain
at
5
99
it
tasted
like
nothing
except
a
little
hoppy
at
the
end
it
reminded
me
of
bud
red
dog
from
back
in
highschool
with
a
hoppy
but
not
so
happy
ending
i
wish
i
went
for
the
9
dollar
six
kbc
ipa
is
the
kind
of
beer
one
buys
once
i
will
drink
it
if
it
was
free
but
certainly
would
not
buy
it
again
life
is
too
short
an
ok
ipa
chilled
for
a
warm
day
the
price
is
the
best
thing
about
it
the
taste
tends
to
lean
more
on
the
sweet
side
than
the
hoppy
side
this
is
ok
but
for
an
ipa
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
bite
still
there
is
a
decent
caramel
maltiness
followed
by
the
bitterness
nothing
extraordinary
but
fairly
drinkable
deep
copper
color
with
brilliant
clarity
minimal
head
covers
most
of
the
top
of
this
beer
aroma
of
pine
like
hops
but
they
dont
seem
very
prominent
the
mouth
is
a
bit
warm
and
salty
the
flavor
is
a
bit
like
that
of
an
ipa
strained
through
a
dirty
sock
the
aroma
seems
to
promise
more
but
that
taste
is
rather
odd
im
hoping
this
is
the
same
beer
that
is
also
referred
to
as
kbc
ipa
the
label
looks
different
from
whats
pictured
here
but
it
does
say
kennebunkport
brewing
i
actually
like
this
a
lot
even
though
it
has
a
taste
thats
somewhat
thinner
and
maybe
slightly
more
bitter
than
my
favorite
ipas
i
find
it
crisp
and
refreshing
and
besides
that
its
a
good
choice
for
the
value
only
6
for
6
at
trader
joes
overall
i
am
a
huge
ipa
guy
and
i
did
not
really
care
for
this
brew
they
could
have
done
better
poured
into
my
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
best
by
414
pours
a
bright
orange
with
a
one
inch
white
head
that
leaves
some
lace
smell
is
hard
candy
tangerine
apple
cider
grapefruit
and
caramel
taste
is
all
about
hard
candy
caramel
and
grapefruit
body
is
medium
plenty
of
carbonation
a
little
dry
and
goes
down
easy
enough
not
my
thing
but
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
english
ipas
overall
i
want
to
like
this
beer
i
really
do
but
unfortunately
i
would
not
recommend
it
it
smells
too
sweet
isnt
very
well
balanced
in
flavors
and
is
just
missing
something
special
to
make
it
stand
out
it
isnt
the
worst
ive
had
but
it
certainly
isnt
the
best
its
just
a
boring
average
ipa
with
nothing
special
to
offer
this
is
a
drinkable
affordable
read
inexpensive
english
ipa
im
surprised
to
read
so
many
negative
reviews
perhaps
my
colleagues
on
ba
were
expecting
the
kind
of
inyourface
hopwallop
that
american
ipas
offer
this
beer
doesnt
offer
anything
like
that
its
very
sweet
heavily
malted
fairly
bitter
and
throws
in
lots
of
citral
and
a
few
herbal
notes
for
good
measure
im
okay
with
that
overall
to
the
point
ipa
at
a
reasonable
price
wont
blow
you
away
with
flavor
but
still
has
more
than
your
standard
beer
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
enjoyable
brew
with
nice
bitterness
but
not
overly
alcoholic
it
had
adequate
carbonation
a
solid
mouthfeel
and
a
good
finish
i
like
an
ipa
that
is
strong
on
bitterness
but
less
than
7
0
alcohol
so
i
can
enjoy
more
than
one
solid
englishstyle
ipa
especially
at
the
cheap
price
point
the
misleading
label
the
word
english
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
can
be
attributed
to
the
low
score
here
overall
a
bad
ipa
but
an
ok
amber
o
very
good
ipa
worth
buying
again
o
i
have
enjoied
most
beers
i
have
tasted
from
maine
was
very
excited
to
try
this
beer
however
i
feel
as
though
they
were
truly
trying
to
put
to
much
into
the
bottle
and
the
end
result
is
an
overflavored
awkward
beer
this
is
a
below
average
example
of
the
style
way
too
much
caramel
and
a
little
too
spicy
o
overall
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
beer
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
little
more
balanced
and
with
more
aromaticflavorful
hops
than
just
the
bittering
ones
not
sure
i
would
have
another
of
these
and
i
really
enjoy
almost
all
ipas
overall
a
pretty
good
english
ipa
not
to
be
compared
with
an
american
ipa
mouthfeel
light
to
medium

up

creating
an

my
palatenot
overly

985
o
unbalanced
not
at
all
what
an
ipa
should
resemble
just
a
terrible
beer
overall
fair
if
you
convince
yourself
youre
drinking
an
amber
ale
with
a
bit
of
hoppiness
you
might
be
impressed
if
youre
at
trader
joes
looking
for
a
bargain
ipa
id
go
with
their
superior
state
street
label
just
not
what
i
expect
in
an
ipa
overly
sweet
and
likely
using
old
hops
the
aroma
is
godawful
even
for
the
price
this
vacilates
between
messy
and
mediocre
there
are
far
better
choices
especially
in
socal
id
advise
avoidance
that
said
if
my
expectations
were
set
for
an
english
ipa
i
might
reevaluate
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
coppery
amber
half
finger
off
wthite
head
with
decent
retention
and
light
lacing
aroma
dominated
by
caramel
malt
with
faint
hops
sweet
and
a
hint
of
diacetyl
flavor
starts
malty
with
light
sweet
fruit
and
caramel
malt
but
changes
to
a
dryer
grassy
malt
finish
with
somewhat
astringent
hop
finish
medium
bodied
odd
that
this
was
labeled
as
an
ipa
there
is
little
distinct
hop
presence
except
for
bittering
hops
in
the
finish
the
color
maltiness
and
low
key
neutral
hops
seem
to
put
this
solidly
in
the
amber
ale
category
an
adequate
amber
ale
with
a
somewhat
sweet
but
decently
malty
start
but
unbalanced
with
a
mediocre
finish
slight
point
reduction
for
not
being
to
style
i
think
from
the
the
description
of
this
ipa
of
the
package
this
is
an
english
ipa
and
all
the
characteristics
match
that
of
an
eipa
so
taking
that
in
to
account
kbc
ipa
is
light
tasty
and
did
a
great
job
at
creating
an
authentic
eipa
overall
meh
hops
are
not
very
forward
malts
are
more
pronounced
not
quite
an
ipa
pours
a
murky
dark
orange
with
a
12
inch
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
foamy
rings
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
some
slight
herbal
aromas
taste
is
extremely
malty
up
front
with
some
herbal
and
mineral
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
that
is
most
definitely
not
a
typical
ipa
again
this
particular
beer
is
not
as
bad
as
i
had
heard
but
its
not
something
i
would
revisit
never
really
got
into
this
beer
id
never
try
it
again
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
homeless
mans
newcastle
overall
not
a
good
ipa
at
all
actually
not
a
good
beer
in
general
i
picked
up
a
6
pack
for
5
on
a
gamble
let
this
review
save
you
5
this
was
probably
the
most
unbalanced
and
oddest
grossest
tasting
beers
ive
ever
had
it
tasted
nothing
like
the
style
it
was
almost
sweet
and
spiced
like
their
winter
ale
the
hops
tasted
like
they
were
synthetic
and
seldomely
added
to
the
wort
overall
not
a
very
memorable
beer
the
hops
are
there
in
the
pine
and
citrus
notes
but
they
are
weak
and
simple
o
by
far
the
most
disappointing
tjs
beer
i
have
tried
to
date
not
undrinkable
but
does
not
fit
the
style
judging
according
to
the
style
it
is
down
right
not
good
as
a
beverage
its
not
bad
as
an
ipa
it
is
bad
will
not
buy
this
one
again
o
like
trying
new
stuff
but
this
was
towards
the
bottom
of
what
i
have
tried
definately
not
an
ipa
hopefully
you
read
this
before
you
buy
it
not
the
best
ipa
but
is
crazy
cheap
so
i
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
feels
spicy
warm
and
not
refreshing
at
all
i
think
this
is
a
strong
british
style
ipa
if
it
was
relabled
as
such
maybe
the
ratings
would
ba
a
bit
better
for
this
maybe
not
overall
better
than
merely
drinkable
yet
this
is
no
ipa
will
taste
better
if
you
think
of
it
as
an
amber
or
brown
ale
doa
o
ive
had
worse
ipas
but
ive
also
had
better
pale
ales
this
beer
stinks
easily
one
of
the
worsts
ipas
i
have
ever
had
not
even
hoppy
enough
to
be
a
good
amber
shame
on
trader
joes
for
selling
this
swill
and
marketing
it
as
an
ipa
of
course
they
sell
some
cheaponotsogood
beer
but
they
dont
pretend
it
is
something
else
the
fake
craft
ipas
from
major
grocery
chains
like
safeway
are
lightyears
ahead
of
this
stuff
pretty
awful
aroma
is
not
particularly
strong
and
is
more
fruity
and
floral
than
hoppy
it
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
amber
with
a
thick
and
fluffy
ivory
head
flavor
is
fairly
hoppy
and
woody
with
a
sweet
fruity
overtone
almost
no
bitterness
tastes
more
like
a
regular
ale
than
an
ipa
smooth
texture
has
firm
body
and
a
little
bit
of
tingle
fair
to
middlin
but
still
worth
a
fair
shake
overall
this
is
certainly
drinkable
worth
a
try
and
maybe
a
little
more
could
be
a
worthy
every
day
beer
if
the
price
is
right
which
it
might
be
as
it
came
from
trader
joes
i
believe
thanks
brother
for
the
bottle
kennebunkport
ipa
has
almost
nothing
to
recommend
it
and
was
a
drain
pour
for
me
its
not
undrinkable
but
i
have
no
shortage
of
good
beers
waiting
to
be
drunk
why
waste
time
here
alas
you
cant
win
them
all
o
i
wouldnt
pick
up
another
6
pack
of
this
its
the
price
that
called
to
me
and
the
desire
to
try
something
from
maine
aat
4
49
i
cant
say
i
lost
too
much
kind
of
an
amber
ale
english
ipa
hybrid
not
great
but
certainly
worth
the
5
99
i
paid
at
trader
joes
no
ipa
but
a
decent
drinker
o
this
beer
taste
decent
but
since
i
read
the
label
i
was
expecting
an
ipa
so
my
rating
is
based
on
the
actual
taste
of
the
beer
and
i
am
ignoring
the
style
label
maybe
federal
jacks
will
change
the
classification
overall
not
that
great
tastes
bland
pours
an
orangish
yellow
sort
of
color
smells
like
a
dirty
shoe
i
actually
put
my
nose
to
pulled
back
and
went
ugh
some
hops
on
the
nose
maybe
some
citrus
but
just
doesnt
smell
appealing
at
all
taste
seems
to
be
more
malty
than
hoppy
there
are
hops
there
just
not
much
of
em
mouthfeel
is
at
least
a
bit
creamy
carbonated
and
nice
overall
average
at
best
however
its
a
buck
not
not
bad
for
a
buck
conclusion
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
just
not
what
it
claims
to
be
ipa
as
an
ipa
i
give
it
a
2
as
an
american
pa
id
give
it
a
4
final
thought
at
1
a
bottle
and
6
2
abv
give
it
a
try
if
you
havent
had
it
picked
up
a
sixer
for
5
99
at
tjs
the
other
day
no
clue
what
it
was
but
it
said
ipa
and
there
is
a
new
label
to
confuse
the
masses
the
appearance
is
a
nice
amber
colored
ale
that
produces
a
big
foamy
offwhite
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
the
smell
consists
of
a
lot
of
bubble
gum
whiffs
floral
and
some
apricot
skin
a
little
too
much
in
the
gum
flavor
the
taste
is
somewhat
spicy
up
front
with
a
bandaid
taste
next
and
some
fading
hops
in
the
back
of
the
throat
a
lot
of
malt
in
the
mix
too
it
has
a
medicinelike
aftertaste
with
a
slight
bitterness
sort
of
a
mess
overall
i
didnt
hate
the
sixer
for
the
price
i
would
deem
this
more
of
a
pale
ale
and
would
surly
be
disappointed
to
taste
this
at
an
ipa
festival
for
what
its
worth
its
different
i
will
not
be
buying
more
even
at
that
price
but
am
happy
to
have
given
it
a
shot
it
is
going
to
be
hard
to
finish
this
bottle
since
i
couldnt
make
my
own
sixer
at
trader
joes
ive
got
5
left
to
give
to
friends
pours
a
reddish
gold
with
a
creamy
tall
quivering
head
smells
of
stale
beer
and
wet
grains
taste
is
extremely
malty
and
sickeningly
sweet
with
a
metallic
aftertastenot
sure
where
the
hops
are
not
much
like
an
ipa
at
all
t
gross
gross
gross
gross
gross
possibly
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
i
didnt
think
anything
could
be
worse
than
kennebunkports
wheat
beer
but
this
blows
that
one
away
it
has
a
weird
lager
flavor
upfront
followed
by
this
really
off
acidic
metallic
flavor
that
goes
through
the
finish
its
a
little
bitter
but
not
in
a
hoppy
way
at
all
this
beer
tastes
like
licking
rust
absolutely
awful
avoid
at
all
costs
o
trader
joes
sells
some
really
nice
good
quality
budget
brews
this
sadly
aint
one
of
them
pick
up
a
sixer
of
their
mission
st
ipa
instead
and
call
it
a
day
as
kennebunkports
ipa
is
just
that
bunk
o
very
below
average
ipa
i
wouldnt
even
consider
this
a
true
ipa
due
to
the
lack
of
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
not
only
is
this
not
an
ideal
ipa
it
is
also
not
an
ideal
beer
in
general
i
will
avoid
this
beer
in
the
future
its
opening
day
for
my
chisox
and
this
is
the
random
beer
to
help
celebrate
best
before
052011
check
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
orange
fleshamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
orange
zest
wheat
coriander
light
black
pepper
light
cilantro
light
lemon
zest
and
light
caramel
were
definitely
looking
at
some
spicy
citrus
hops
here
folks
so
no
misconceptions
regarding
pine
should
enter
into
things
the
taste
revels
in
the
juxtaposition
between
the
sweet
caramel
and
light
buttery
biscuit
and
the
peppery
herbal
bitter
hops
that
nestle
thereamongst
the
malt
though
drops
out
kinda
quickly
leaving
a
sensation
akin
to
licking
bay
leaves
or
something
along
those
lines
theres
definitely
chlorophyll
involved
so
a
promising
start
shoots
off
a
cliff
a
bit
but
luckily
not
too
fast
to
really
torpedo
things
entirely
the
body
is
a
very
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
pretty
dry
finish
overall
im
not
putting
this
in
the
ipa
pantheon
but
id
certainly
consider
drinking
one
again
poured
this
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
burnt
orange
color
semi
cloudy
it
produced
a
white
head
but
retention
was
poor
after
1
min
there
was
0
head
left
the
aroma
of
the
beer
is
not
what
i
would
expect
for
an
ipa
i
smell
very
slight
amount
of
hops
but
mostly
a
floral
and
medicinal
aroma
it
gets
worse
with
the
taste
no
hops
to
speak
of
a
very
bad
medicinal
taste
and
hints
of
caramel
not
sure
how
this
can
be
an
ipa
overall
very
bad
beer
if
i
did
drain
pours
this
would
be
one
im
going
to
suck
it
up
and
take
one
for
the
team
this
is
officially
my
first
fail
didnt
think
it
would
come
so
soon
got
this
beer
as
a
gift
i
would
not
consider
this
an
ipa
at
all
there
is
no
hop
aroma
no
hop
flavor
a
very
poor
pale
ale
at
best
would
not
recommend
especially
if
you
enjoy
a
good
quality
ipa
the
only
thing
this
beer
has
in
its
favor
is
that
it
pours
a
nice
color
and
had
a
decent
head
picked
this
up
at
trader
joes
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
an
average
amount
of
head
not
the
typical
hoppy
nose
smells
a
little
off
not
a
good
flavor
either
doesnt
seem
like
an
ipa
at
all
need
to
pound
this
one
and
move
on
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
live
and
learn
d
not
great
4
oz
in
and
im
done
with
this
i
keep
trying
to
like
it
but
its
just
nothing
drinkability
did
they
mislabel
their
amber
ale
as
an
ipa
honestly
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
this
was
an
ipa
if
they
hadnt
called
it
that
there
are
almost
no
hops
to
speak
of
and
it
has
a
strange
fruitycaramel
flavor
to
it
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
an
ipa
avoid
d
i
never
drain
pour
beer
but
this
is
as
close
as
it
gets
i
recommend
avoiding
this
beer
worst
ipa
ever
drinkability
this
really
isnt
bad
overall
as
a
beer
but
as
an
ipa
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
and
not
dry
enough
it
could
use
some
more
hop
additions
for
sure
but
is
still
a
decent
drink
maybe
a
good
ipa
for
those
new
to
beerhops
overall
the
first
few
sip
of
this
beer
were
better
than
the
middle
and
end
of
the
glass
it
was
still
good
all
the
way
through
but
as
the
sour
and
sweet
flavors
built
on
the
palate
it
became
less
and
less
of
the
bitter
and
hoppy
ipa
i
seemed
to
be
drinking
in
the
beginning
d
the
beer
is
beautiful
however
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
both
off
for
the
style
and
not
very
appealing
d
the
appearance
and
aftertaste
are
about
as
good
as
this
ipa
gets
the
flavor
underwhelmed
me
but
at
the
price
point
of
5
996pk
i
cant
find
too
many
complaints
here
an
interesting
contract
brew
with
a
special
deal
at
trader
joes
that
allure
aside
its
a
pretty
forgettable
onedimensional
ipa
d
drinkability
is
not
offensive
but
the
mild
astringency
could
grow
fatiguing
this
isnt
quite
in
the
american
ipa
category
but
its
also
a
bit
too
hoppybitter
to
be
an
english
ipa
closer
to
that
than
american
though
d
this
tiptoes
along
the
line
between
ipa
and
plain
old
pale
ale
as
a
pale
ale
this
would
be
boring
and
flat
as
an
ipa
this
is
pretty
far
off
the
mark
sweet
lacking
substantial
bitterness
and
featuring
few
noteworthy
hop
flavors
or
aromas
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
disappointingly
weak
for
the
style
and
unlikely
to
impress
what
can
i
write
in
this
review
that
will
differentiate
it
from
the
others
decent
appearance
with
a
fair
head
retention
a
slightly
floral
scent
and
a
nonobtrusive
taste
that
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
a
slight
bitterness
comes
in
during
the
aftertaste
with
carbonation
being
very
present
i
echo
hmk22s
comment
that
this
could
be
considered
a
gateway
beer
but
its
largely
forgettable
not
bad
for
a
dollar
im
not
as
negative
as
some
reviewers
about
this
beer
its
not
going
to
make
the
ipa
hall
of
fame
but
its
a
decent
ipa
style
for
the
price
i
find
that
context
is
important
with
a
lot
of
these
trader
joes
and
whole
foods
house
brand
beers
they
are
from
noname
or
dba
breweries
and
are
probably
developed
for
palates
that
are
or
aspire
to
be
above
the
bmc
fray
but
arent
ready
to
say
sign
up
for
a
ba
account
so
beer
aficionados
will
always
be
a
little
disappointed
as
the
reviews
illustrate
but
tjs
and
wf
are
legendary
for
reading
their
customer
base
and
giving
them
what
they
want
so
these
offerings
fill
a
niche
and
not
so
badly
imo
who
knows
maybe
they
can
be
gateway
beers
to
the
major
stuff
i
dont
think
i
would
choose
this
beer
again
if
i
had
another
beer
to
choose
from
depending
on
the
choice
of
course
d
its
ok
but
it
is
not
really
much
of
an
aipa
i
think
the
marks
would
be
better
if
they
labeled
it
an
amber
or
copper
ale
the
price
is
nice
however
drinkability
is
average
this
one
is
not
worthy
of
mass
consumption
for
my
two
cents
i
think
it
really
tastes
like
they
brought
some
butthole
soup
to
the
bottling
line
d
not
the
most
horrid
thing
on
earth
but
it
wasnt
a
strong
and
bitter
ipa
by
any
measure
seemed
a
little
synthetic
to
me
if
i
change
my
mind
i
will
update
my
review
d
moderate
drinkability
a
bit
filling
at
times
abv
unlisted
a
decent
beer
to
have
with
equally
strong
cheese
perhaps
not
entirely
great
on
its
own
this
would
be
a
good
pale
at
a
brewpub
not
so
much
when
competing
with
green
flashs
and
boulder
brewings
hoppy
beers
still
this
would
be
a
good
sessioner
from
the
draught
reviewed
from
notes
d
mild
mannered
ipa
drinkability
is
the
only
thing
i
am
impressed
with
im
really
glad
i
only
had
one
bottle
of
this
i
definitely
wont
look
for
this
beer
again
d
if
you
are
looking
for
an
ipa
you
might
want
to
keep
looking
this
doesnt
taste
nor
feel
like
one
its
not
horrendous
but
its
not
great
either
kennebunkport
ipa
is
drinkable
in
that
it
hardly
tastes
like
a
beer
certainly
not
an
ipa
at
best
you
could
call
this
a
bad
take
on
a
scottish
ale
that
would
be
a
gift
i
suppose
its
befitting
that
the
core
of
their
name
is
bunk
this
beer
is
a
mockery
at
best
again
it
isnt
an
ipa
thus
it
is
a
failure
overall
overall
the
beer
is
an
ok
ipa
the
beer
doesnt
overwhelm
with
hops
which
i
liked
but
most
hop
lovers
might
be
disappointed
if
you
want
an
ipa
with
minimal
hops
than
give
this
beer
a
try
got
a
6pack
from
trader
joes
for
6
not
bad
for
the
price
has
a
pleasant
and
mild
fruity
taste
for
an
ipa
not
very
hoppy
at
all
decent
for
a
warm
spring
afternoon
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
but
might
pick
it
up
again
considering
the
price
this
is
truly
a
get
what
you
pay
for
beer
at
6
12
ounce
bottle
from
a
six
pack
a
buddy
purchased
at
trader
joes
has
best
enjoyed
before
dating
notched
onto
the
side
of
the
label
pours
clear
glowing
orange
tinged
amber
medium
tan
head
leaves
barely
adequate
bits
of
lace
lightly
leafy
hop
nose
on
the
malty
side
for
an
aipa
hops
barely
present
and
not
packing
anything
close
to
a
punch
works
as
a
sessioner
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
an
ipa
without
hops
is
like
acdc
without
rock
a
travesty
would
i
drink
it
again
maybe
its
cheap
and
easily
available
at
trader
joes
which
is
a
plus
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
offered
to
me
but
im
not
going
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
when
theres
better
beers
even
in
this
price
range
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
but
for
an
ipa
it
is
terrible
it
does
not
follow
the
style
at
all
and
i
will
have
to
give
it
a
bad
rateing
only
based
on
the
style
otherwise
a
great
beer
awsome
drinkability
this
ipa
has
arrived
smack
dab
in
the
middle
of
my
ipa
kick
its
a
quaffable
beer
with
a
nice
floral
nose
copper
in
color
and
sweet
to
finish
it
starts
with
a
citrus
hop
scent
and
while
in
the
mouth
dances
as
it
finishes
down
it
is
a
bit
more
of
a
session
beer
vs
a
treat
and
in
a
6
00
six
pack
market
i
like
that
i
enjoyed
it
you
should
too
disappointing
on
the
palate
to
say
the
least
some
washed
out
grains
and
a
touch
of
hops
is
the
most
that
this
beer
musters
in
the
flavor
department
it
felt
a
little
dishwater
like
through
the
center
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
really
light
and
crisp
with
the
hoppy
bite
and
high
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
for
an
ipa
but
not
as
hoppy
as
i
expected
this
was
in
no
ways
reminiscent
of
any
ipa
i
have
ever
had
to
me
an
ok
beer
and
a
way
below
average
ipa
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
however
it
is
an
average
at
best
ipa
very
reminiscent
of
fullers
esb
i
would
drink
this
again
but
not
as
an
ipa
overall
very
drinkable
just
not
remarkable
d
is
overall
a
bad
ipa
but
a
good
bitter
or
esb
needs
to
have
the
right
name
it
ticks
me
off
when
breweries
label
a
beer
an
ipa
to
sell
more
beer
when
it
is
obviously
not
its
a
really
weird
beer
im
drinking
it
right
now
and
its
just
not
an
ipa
or
even
an
eastcoast
ipa
as
one
would
expect
very
little
hop
bitterness
no
bitter
backbone
sweet
but
with
a
weird
sort
of
offflavor
that
shows
up
occasionally
especially
in
the
aroma
simply
not
to
style
as
an
american
pale
ale
more
like
a
british
ale
but
not
a
good
one
either
theres
probably
a
reason
these
are
only
found
in
trader
joes
dont
let
the
cheapness
sucker
you
in
very
delicious
and
has
all
the
ingredients
of
a
good
mild
american
ipa
pours
clear
dark
amber
with
little
head
faint
aroma
no
lacing
taste
is
okay
though
not
as
hoppy
as
i
would
like
from
an
ipa
more
sweet
malts
in
the
flavor
than
anything
but
not
unpleasant
some
caramel
and
buttery
accents
some
alcohol
warmth
ok
d
not
bad
really
easy
enough
to
drink
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
price
but
not
something
im
going
to
have
a
craving
for
so
if
i
just
wanted
a
beer
this
could
be
a
decent
goto
if
i
wanted
an
ipa
naaahhh
with
that
im
not
so
sure
thats
why
i
have
the
taste
as
3
really
it
tastes
good
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
an
ipa
id
pass
on
this
unless
you
are
given
one
for
free
or
you
just
wanna
try
as
many
ipas
as
possible
not
a
bad
ipa
not
my
favorite
but
perhaps
ill
get
it
again
sometime
semi
exciting
to
consume
m
d
medium
bodied
a
little
slick
and
oily
it
doesnt
leave
a
whole
lot
of
flavour
behind
but
there
is
a
touch
that
i
can
appreciate
pretty
straight
up
drinking
and
id
be
willing
to
give
it
another
go
slightly
hazed
golden
orange
with
a
tall
head
of
foam
that
dissipates
to
a
soapy
layer
sweet
floral
and
sugary
citrus
hop
aroma
diacetyl
and
biscuit
malts
the
flavor
is
of
citrusy
grassy
hops
finishing
with
some
fresh
grain
and
toasted
caramel
again
a
little
buttery
which
is
not
entirely
unexpected
considering
kennebunkport
is
associated
with
shipyard
as
i
understand
it
and
ringwood
is
probably
used
without
an
adequate
diacetyl
rest
slightly
syrupy
feeling
but
otherwise
medium
bodied
and
modestly
bitter
compared
to
many
other
ipas
not
bad
though
especially
for
the
price
ill
consider
picking
it
up
whenever
i
find
myself
in
tjs
the
cheap
prices
are
too
hard
to
resist
d
this
is
a
below
average
ipa
it
just
doesnt
have
a
great
ipa
flavor
it
was
fairly
dull
copper
colored
with
a
foamy
blonde
head
that
leaves
slippery
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
pineapple
grapefruit
and
bready
yeast
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
fruit
and
caramel
with
a
very
mild
hop
bite
medium
mouthfeel
with
crisp
carbonation
this
beer
is
not
for
most
extreme
beer
people
its
pretty
wimpy
for
an
ipa
but
not
unpleasant
would
have
fared
a
little
better
as
an
english
ipa
i
tried
this
the
other
night
at
buddys
birthday
party
and
found
it
palatable
and
partyworthy
but
not
spectacular
had
i
drank
it
while
sitting
at
my
desk
with
my
critical
faculties
fully
attuned
to
the
beer
then
i
might
share
some
of
the
hypercritical
opinions
of
my
fellow
beer
advocates
but
luckily
for
myself
i
was
able
to
be
busy
enough
to
enjoy
this
beer
it
poured
a
golden
orange
with
a
small
head
head
and
smelled
of
sweet
malts
and
citrusy
hops
the
taste
was
not
as
aggessively
hopped
as
i
would
have
expected
from
an
ipa
but
it
made
for
some
easydrinking
without
feeling
the
need
to
pair
it
with
party
snacks
there
are
definitely
more
exciting
ipas
out
there
but
this
one
can
be
enjoyed
by
just
about
any
macrobrew
drinker
willing
to
give
a
microbrew
a
chance
drinkability
a
mediocre
beer
true
tot
he
style
but
nothing
outstanding
too
many
other
fine
beers
out
there
to
revisit
this
one
overall
its
very
drinkable
and
carbonated
just
not
in
a
very
distinct
ipa

color
14
12
inch
head
with
slight
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
hops
and
a
stronger
sweet
malt
aroma
not
really
an
ipa
too
much
malt
and
too
little
hops
tastes
mostly
of
a
sweet
malt
with
a
hop
background
more
sweet
than
bitter
but
smooth
with
little
carbonation
overall
its
easy
to
drink
but
definitely
not
an
ipa
this
poured
a
slightly
hazy
copper
with
a
bit
of
tan
head
it
smelled
like
orange
and
grapefruit
hops
caramel
malt
and
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
it
tasted
like
sweet
caramel
and
honey
malt
and
sweet
orange
and
bitter
grapefruit
hops
it
was
slightly
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
much
tastier
than
i
expected
although
not
in
a
traditional
ipa
sense
it
had
a
very
nice
sweet
flavor
and
pretty
good
body
and
it
was
clean
and
easy
to
drink
this
was
surprisingly
enjoyable
and
definitely
makes
me
want
to
check
out
other
beers
from
federal
jacks
first
off
this
beer
looks
really
nice
nice
color
solid
head
and
good
retention
however
things
go
downhill
really
quickly
i
took
a
sniff
of
this
and
said
this
is
not
an
ipa
there
is
no
really
hop
presence
on
the
nose
very
much
an
amber
or
red
the
taste
follows
with
no
assertiveness
lots
of
sweetness
but
very
little
bitterness
in
fact
as
it
warms
it
gets
even
sweeter
weird
not
sure
what
was
going
on
with
this
beer
maybe
its
mislabeled
not
recommended
the
taste
is
light
caramelly
bready
maltiness
very
juicy
with
a
light
citrusyleafy
bitterness
with
hints
of
pine
and
grapefruit
apple
and
orange
marmalade
its
on
the
sweet
side
for
an
ipa
starting
quite
sweet
but
the
hops
do
just
take
over
by
the
finish
with
a
lightly
hopdominated
lightly
bitter
finish
but
still
riding
a
somewhat
thick
sweetness
its
got
a
solid
body
and
is
pretty
balanced
making
it
tasty
and
drinkable
and
voerall
a
good
solid
beer
this
clearly
isnt
a
west
coaststyle
ipa
but
thats
fine
and
i
wasnt
expecting
one
nor
do
i
want
all
ipas
to
be
like
that
anyway
picked
it
up
at
trader
joes
arroyo
grande
and
wish
i
would
have
kept
my
money
by
far
one
of
the
worst
ipas
i
have
ever
had
poured
from
the
bottle
with
good
carbonation
settled
with
a
dirty
white
head
and
gold
in
color
smell
was
terrible
i
could
not
smell
any
hops
it
smelled
like
pure
barley
and
water
no
hops
to
mention
no
backbone
and
no
ipa
this
brew
is
interesting
and
consistent
but
not
one
ill
be
seeking
out
in
the
future
i
picked
this
up
at
trader
joes
for
5
99
a
six
i
have
never
heard
of
or
seen
this
beer
before
this
is
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
taste
is
very
very
sweet
with
a
strong
soap
flavor
that
lingers
this
does
not
have
that
bitter
hop
taste
of
a
i
p
a
this
was
husky
soap
sweet
not
true
to
style
i
could
not
finish
one
12
oz
bottle
i
asked
the
check
out
girl
if
she
had
tried
it
she
said
no
but
i
could
return
it
for
a
refund
if
didnt
like
it
i
found
my
receipt
in
the
trash
and
will
get
my
money
back
tomorrow
what
kills
me
is
i
have
five
beers
that
i
cant
drink
and
its
too
late
to
go
out
should
have
picked
up
the
stone
i
p
a
hind
sight
is
2020
and
this
beer
is
garbage
avoid
drinkability
one
of
the
weakest
ipas
ive
ever
tasted
but
again
its
nothing
i
cant
drink
that
said
its
not
something
you
want
to
seek
out
if
youre
at
tjs
grab
a
bottle
at
your
own
risk
and
try
it
if
you
want
but
there
are
better
beers
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
would
ever
come
back
to
d
ick
i
really
liked
the
colordespite
head
issues
and
smell
but
something
seems
to
have
gotten
lost
in
the
taste
meh
ill
probably
not
pick
it
up
again
but
if
i
do
its
not
a
total
loss
dnotes
this
beer
is
kind
of
a
wreck
does
not
really
taste
like
an
ipa
i
can
drink
it
but
it
wasnt
easy
getting
through
a
six
pack
ok
looking
at
this
beers
score
i
was
expecting
far
far
worse
this
is
imho
better
than
a
decent
beer
i
like
this
and
would
be
willing
to
buy
a
sixpack
and
share
with
my
beergeek
friends
it
is
not
at
the
pinnacle
of
ipas
like
stone
or
liberty
but
it
more
than
holds
its
own
what
might
i
be
missing
my
mom
got
me
a
6
pack
of
beer
from
trader
joes
knowing
that
i
like
different
beers
this
is
about
the
least
ipa
i
think
ive
had
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
just
isnt
an
ipa
has
a
decent
color
to
it
a
dark
golden
brown
color
with
a
average
sized
head
smell
is
weak
some
weak
hop
scents
but
thats
about
it
the
taste
isnt
bad
it
is
like
a
weak
pale
ale
though
not
an
ipa
for
any
sense
of
the
style
d
i
wouldnt
recommend
or
purchase
this
beer
again
its
seems
a
poor
example
of
an
ipa
no
thanks
its
not
a
horrible
beer
but
i
wont
be
buying
again
poured
a
medium
clear
copper
with
a
light
white
head
that
dissipated
pretty
quickly
it
was
pretty
bubbly
and
smelled
of
both
hops
and
strong
malt
and
tasted
just
thatquite
hoppy
without
masking
a
great
maltiness
as
well
it
feels
medium
bodied
and
delightfully
bitter
in
the
mouth
this
ipa
goes
down
pretty
smooth
with
a
slightly
bitter
and
hoppy
malt
aftertaste
which
i
found
pretty
enjoyable
not
bad
at
all
for
a
1
bottle
of
ipa
light
copper
pour
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
pretty
quickly
then
the
aroma
gives
a
nice
floral
woody
character
from
the
hops
but
a
little
muted
taste
is
an
average
balanced
session
ipa
kind
of
a
oxymoron
malty
with
a
touch
of
hops
but
very
clean
mouthfeel
is
also
very
average
but
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
for
a
few
dollars
more
i
could
pick
up
many
any
brews
that
are
an
order
of
magnitude
better
i
gave
them
a
shot
but
twas
not
to
be
before
drinking
this
i
read
some
other
reviews
and
was
expecting
something
really
bad
but
i
must
say
its
not
a
bad
beer
and
im
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
smell
is
very
weak
very
light
hops
taste
is
hops
but
not
much
else
also
not
real
balanced
too
bitter
a
bit
unpleasantly
sour
and
hops
are
just
not
right
carbonation
seems
heavier
than
it
should
almost
a
slight
metallic
aftertaste
and
there
is
an
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
fine
not
too
drinkable
due
to
the
poor
flavor
though
finish
was
perhaps
the
best
part
as
the
flavors
faded
to
a
decent
clean
bitterness
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
drinkability
a
little
bent
to
the
harsh
bitter
side
the
flavor
is
decent
but
not
one
id
pass
around
pours
a
nice
copper
and
offers
a
nice
hoppiness
would
like
a
little
more
flavor
and
crispness
its
a
little
filmy
at
the
finish
but
overall
a
nice
beer
ive
also
had
this
on
tap
at
federal
jacks
where
it
was
a
fine
offering
unlike
everyone
elsei
really
liked
this
beer
it
is
really
kind
of
on
the
weak
side
for
an
ipa
but
it
was
tasty
going
down
if
you
can
look
past
that
fact
that
it
is
not
a
true
ipa
you
will
like
it
nice
color
body
and
head
rentention
really
drinkable
and
cheap

and
a

pretty
good

of

malt
although
that
appley
malt
flavor
rears
its
head
a
little
too
much
overall
this
beer
is
just
kind
of
insipid
thin
and
pretty
weak
with
some
odd
offflavors
that
are
decidedly
unipaish
overall
its
not
terrible
at
least
this
ones
actually
an
ipa
unlike
the
alexander
keiths
just
not
one
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
d
as
i
finished
this
bottle
my
opinion
of
the
beer
continued
to
deteriorate
as
the
clash
of
sweet
and
bitter
became
irritating
and
less
pleasant
i
also
started
to
feel
like
it
was
leaving
my
mouth
too
dry
it
was
worth
trying
but
yea
wont
be
picking
this
up
again
average
mouthfeel
and
almost
average
drinkability
unbalanced
and
missing
something
not
my
cup
o
tea
i
should
reiterate
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
actually
quite
enjoyable
im
only
giving
this
one
a
relatively
low
score
because
im
scoring
according
to
its
fidelity
to
style
as
well
and
the
smell
and
taste
are
nothing
like
an
ipa
even
an
english
one
can
get
a
bit
too
fizzy
but
nice
medium
texture
overall
drinkable
notes
please
dont
serve
this
to
someone
dabbling
in
the
craft
beer
world
it
was
decent
for
a
bottle
but
far
from
desireable
in
the
future
again
its
more
like
an
englishstyle
ipa
not
bad
but
i
miss

but
its
not
that
bad
this
is
an
ok
ale
not
something
ill
ever
seek
out
again
but
one
ill
drink
if
someone
offers
me
a
free
one
o
the
problem
here
may
lie
with
the
english
ipa
style
itself
which
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
and
uninteresting
kiuchi
tries
with
this
but
it
doesnt
succeed
all
around
o
the
bottle
version
didnt
quite
match
the
more
distinct
dynamic
flavors
of
the
tap
version
i
had
years
back
that
being
the
first
time
i
had
tried
the
beer
it
was
a
hitachino
event
for
charity
right
after
the
tsunami
7
or
8
of
their
beers
on
tap
at
kraftwork
i
could
see
flashes
of
that
beers
greatness
in
this
definitely
one
to
seek
out
its
different
othis
is
a
unique
beer
in
both
good
and
bad
ways
i
suspect
that
my
bottle
was
old
because
it
lacked
any
semblance
of
a
hoppy
punch
and
even
the
cedar
had
faded
a
bit
into
the
background
that
being
said
i
think
i
could
get
into
this
beer
if
i
could
find
a
fresh
example
because
the
citruscedar
aspect
is
really
intriguing
it
seems
like
a
good
summertime
combination
poured
a
gorgeous
fully
cloudy
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
it
looks
like
gorgeous
natural
earthy
unfiltered
apple
juice
just
looking
at
it
makes
me
want
to
drink
it
scents
of
caramel
earthy
herbal
hops
earthy
yeast
grape
slight
citrus
aromas
in
the
background
and
faint
undercurrents
of
cedar
a
very
nice
earthy
sweet
fruity
aroma
profile
different
from
a
lot
of
ipas
even
english
style
ipas
that
ive
had
its
pleasant
and
inviting
taste
begins
sweet
with
caramel
moving
into
some
nice
herbal
hops
and
a
tealike
flavor
throughout
there
is
a
nice
musky
earthy
yeasty
presence
that
compliments
the
herbal
and
tea
flavors
of
the
hops
wonderfully
there
are
also
slight
undercurrents
of
cedar
in
the
background
throughout
the
sip
and
some
light
citrus
peel
bitterness
on
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
mildly
bitter
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
a
good
earthy
sweet
balanced
flavor
that
avoids
being
both
too
sweet
and
too
bitter
very
well
executed
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
and
with
low
carbonation
it
feels
like
a
good
classic
style
ale
should
quite
nice
overall
this
is
a
very
good
take
on
an
english
ipa
its
balanced
and
malty
but
with
a
good
underlying
bitterness
and
an
aroma
that
is
flat
out
amazing
very
highly
recommended
a
light
and
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
nice
light
golden
brown
with
a
12
inch
head
that
quickly
dissipates
very
mild
lacing
on
the
glass
first
sip
is
fairly
sweet
and
you
can
taste
a
little
bit
of
cedar
from
the
casks
lots
of
yeast
particles
are
visible
through
the
glass
has
a
great
hearty
mouthfeel
some
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
and
after
awhile
you
can
start
tasting
the
alcohol
at
the
end
some
slight
citrus
scent
and
taste
a
very
nice
beer
thats
got
some
character
to
it
very
great
beer
i
love
the
spice
and
malty
smell
the
cedar
lingers
in
your
mouth
its
like
sitting
in
a
library
with
this
beer
the
7
alcohol
level
really
is
hidden
its
a
very
effervescent
beer
and
thats
pretty
rare
for
a
japanese
beer
but
it
also
still
retains
a
dry
aftertaste
overall
drinkability
with
its
unique
taste
a
sipping
beer
and
yet
very
drinkable
as
well
i
could
easily
have
another
or
at
least
would
not
mind
it
if
it
came
in
a
bigger
bottle
i
wonder
how
this
beer
is
on
tap
i
definitely
would
buy
this
again
overall
it
has
aspects
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
and
american
ipa
and
that
distinct
cedar
aging
that
is
like
no
other
style
well
done
while
i
wished
there
were
more
cedar
in
the
aroma
it
came
through
stunningly
towards
the
back
of
the
tongue
this
is
definitely
a
unique
ipa
at
least
as
far
as
ive
tasted
but
its
one
that
i
certainly
find
myself
enjoying
cedar
is
a
treearoma
flavour
i
guess
that
holds
great
personal
significance
so
i
may
enjoy
it
more
than
others
because
of
the
intangibles
it
evokes
definitely
worth
your
time
though
if
you
find
yourself
curious
overall
i
was
a
bit
put
off
by
the
malt
in
some
way
and
the
nose
was
a
bit
odd
for
me
it
was
unusual
in
a
way
that
i
was
not
sure
of
otherwise
this
was
a
fantastic
english
style
ipa
i
would
buy
this
again
as
i
would
many
other
beers
from
hitachino
o
this
brew
totally
blew
me
away
it
was
worth

id
like
to

mouthfeel
is

some

with
that
this

were
more

this
is
a
pretty
good

with

fairly

the
flavors
are
solid
and
tasty
especially
as
the
beer
warms

bland

others
have
mentioned
at
all
instead
i
get
impressions
of
apricots

taste
reminds
me
of
a
more
refined

arrive
first
but
the
overall
taste
is
nicely
balanced
by
the
finish
slight
lingering
taste
of
citrus
left
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
mouthfeel
was
a
little
sharp
right
out
of
the
fridge
but
it
is
becoming
more
soft
and
luscious
as
it
warms
up
ill
definitely
buy
some
more
given
the
price
of
getting
it
here
in
kc
i
cant
imagine
i
would
drink
this
one
often
but
its
a
very
tasty
beer
and
one
i
would
recommend
to
someone
wanting
to
delve
into
the
japanese
microbrewery
scene
when
i
tried
to
relate
to
people
and
promote
this
beer
i
never
had
to
lie
yet
i
always
had
to
be
cheesy
would
you
like
to
drink
the
scent
of
a
cigar
box
honestly
i
cant
move
beyond
the
cedar
nose
and
who
doesnt
love
the
mysterious
scent
of
their
fathers
cedar
cigar
box
this
is
also
the
only
beer
ive
ever
encountered
with
this
flavor
profile
so
points
for
originality
and
brilliantly
unlike
a
typical
strange
or
experimental
brew
it
actually
works
and
is
elegant
and
challenging
my
personal
favorite
from
hitachino
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
be
drank
and
appreciated
in
small
quantities
amongst
friends
i
can
say
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
hooked
on
learning
more
about
craft
breweries
a
real
treat
this
beer
is
really
good
truly
an
experience
and
what
picking
out
a
single
bottle
is
about
cedar
awesome
beer
from
japan
out
of
the
ordinary
you
should
try
this
because
id
love
to
hear
your
thoughts
overall
a
nice
treat
especially
giving
its
regional
location
it
can
act
as
a
great
way
to
start
or
end
an
evening
but
with
apec
assistance
needed
if
the
intention
is
to
pull
you
through
the
night
bottled
amber
color
big
offwhite
head
aroma
is
fruits
marzipan
quite
sweet
nutmeg
like
notes
as
well
as
some
mild
spices
flavor
is
wood
mild
smoked
wet
things
as
well
as
spices
and
quite
nutty
mild
vanilla
very
different
yet
pleasant
brew
o
very
enjoyable
and
the
addition
of
the
cedar
is
very
interesting
not
quite
sessionable
but
easy
to
drink
o
love
this
one
it
actually
exhibits
a
balance
and
details
that
i
prefer
to
my
previous
top
ale
the
hennepin
o
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
interesting
beer
due
to
the
cedar
aromas
and
flavorsit
seemed
like
just
enough
cedar
was
added
without
being
enough
to
completely
overpower
the
beer
overall
what
a
strange
beer
it
has
kind
of
grown
on
me
but
i
feel
like
this
brew
could
be
an
acquired
taste
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
i
really
like
this
it
would
probably
be
a
goto
beer
if
i
could
find
it
easily
and
at
a
reasonable
price
its
a
beery
beer
without
any
crazy
flavors
with
enough
complexity
to
keep
me
interested
overall
a
good
beer
not
amazing
not
great
just
a
good
brew
in
moderation
i
dont
think
id
get
again
but
i
did
enjoy
but
would
probably
enjoy
with
a
great
cigar
for
sure
i
had
this
down
as
comparable
to
meantime
ipa
but
its
not
there
orange
and
caramel
sure
enough
but
needs
to
take
the
leash
off
aroma
is
typically
malty
with
a
firm
hoppy
and
woody
undertone
and
a
touch
of
fruit
it
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
fairly
thick
offwhite
head
malty
flavor
has
appreciable
hoppy
and
fruity
notes
and
just
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
smooth
flavor
has
about
average
body
and
a
good
amount
of
ragged
fizz
though
not
spectacular
still
an
enjoyable
brew
o
i
wish
it
had
less
caramel
flavor
but
its
not
bad

b
unique
distinctive
and
worthy
of
much
more
noteriety
draft
hazy
deep
golden
body
frothy
offwhite
head
aroma
of
toasted
malt
cookie
and
bread
floral
hops
and
earthiness
noes
of
orange
and
honey
the
flavor
is
lightly
to
moderately
sweet
and
lightly
bitter
it
finishes
lightly
sweet
and
moderately
bitter
medium
body
creamy
texture
average
carbonation
sweetness
and
bitterness
are
nicely
proportioned
for
an
ipa
a
softer
presentation
than
american
ipas
especially
in
the
mouthfeel
which
is
less
carbonated
and
less
crisp
very
good
very
tasty
brew
overall
what
to
make
of
a
beer
that
breaks
nearly
every
mold
refuses
to
fit
in
a
neat
category
and
generally
leaves
as
many
questions
as
answers
my
general
rule
of
beer
is
that
i
would
rather
be
shocked
than
bored
rather
find
something
new
than
just
another
solid
example
of
a
well
defined
style
average
ipas
seemingly
grow
on
trees
this
beer
whatever
it
is
it
anything
but
average
maybe
not
the
first
choice
for
a
hophead
but
the
ride
is
worth
taking
for
anyone
who
loves
beer
i
was
worried
with
this
one
i
usually
dont
like
wood
aged
beers
unless
theyre
a
strong
ale
or
burton
baton
on
top
of
that
its
cedar
one
of
the
strongest
tastes
a
wood
can
have
the
cedar
came
through
well
bubbling
up
after
a
few
sips
but
it
didnt
take
over
whew
the
harsh
woody
bitterness
was
there
but
it
wasnt
overpowering
it
just
forced
me
to
sip
and
enjoy
this
english
ipa
a
little
more
over
time
this
isnt
something
id
buy
a
12
pack
of
but
its
a
great
beer
of
which
i
want
more
o
interesting
beer
an
english
india
pale
modeled
in
japanese
tradition
of
being
aged
in
cedar
casks
and
then
hopped
with
an
american
hops
it
was
good
but
no
where
near
what
i
would
call
an
ipa
drinkability
the
best
japanese
beer
ive
ever
had
though
it
is
my
fist
craft
beer
from
that
country
great
use
of
ingredients
good
method
and
subtle
wood
experience
make
this
beer
a
great
drinker
that
i
would
seek
out
if
available
o
probably
really
good
fresh
still
pretty
good
for
being
a
bit
old
has
held
up
pretty
well
o
almost
too
grapeykoolaidish
otherwise
good
recommended
will
look
for
more
of
this
breweries
beers
a
nice
cloudy
copper
amber
pour
with
a
lasting
tan
head
with
descent
lacing
aroma
and
taste
of
sweet
caramel
malt
with
some
nice
citrus
piney
hops
and
some
spicy
fruity
notes
a
nice
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
sweet
malt
with
some
good
citrusy
piney
hops
for
balance
and
fruity
notes
on
the
ending
overall
a
good
balanced
easy
drinking
ipa
quite
an
interesting
brew
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
golden
color
the
head
was
fluffy
and
white
it
settles
in
a
short
period
of
time
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
hoppy
aromas
mixed
with
the
grainy
malts
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
where
i
find
this
to
be
the
best
the
flavors
of
wild
rice
malts
black
pepper
and
hops
all
come
together
here
i
never
would
have
guessed
that
this
beer
would
have
that
much
going
on
inside
it
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
light
and
drinkable
overall
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
and
would
probably
have
it
again
one
day
tastes
of
lavender
chamomile
hopes
bitterness
malt
honey
malt
fluff
flowers
rice
fizz
mint
citurs
plumy
tastes
and
pure
cane
sugar
smell
like
an
ipa
from
japan
lol
that
and
plenty
of
malty
good
hops
hops
and
hops
pretty
dope
yall
the
beer
is
a
bit
thin
and
almost
over
carbonated
its
very
dry
and
bitter
the
aftertaste
that
lingers
a
little
longer
than
i
would
like
i
enjoyed
this
beer
for
sure
but
would
have
liked
a
little
more
smoothness
my
throat
felt
super
dry
when
done
drinking
this
brew
just
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
is
good
for
me
into
a
pint
glass
this
pours
a
glowing
copper
color
with
a
cloudy
look
if
you
let
the
bottle
sediment
in
aroma
is
a
modest
yet
inviting
one
with
notes
of
toasted
malt
citrus
and
floral
hops
sweet
citrus
hops
gently
mingle
on
the
palate
with
a
balancing
crisp
and
refreshing
malt
theres
a
noticeable
sakeesque
taste
throughout
particularly
with
the
dryness
in
the
finish
orange
citrus
noted
hops
resonate
in
the
aftertaste
smooth
for
its
7
5
abv
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
from
hitachino
and
even
better
when
drunk
during
a
hot
day
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
interested
in
a
break
from
hopped
up
ipas
that
most
people
seem
to
prefer
poured
from
a
24
into
a
sam
adams
glass
dark
yellow
with
lots
of
particulate
floating
around
huge
head
that
slowly
fades
to
a
heavy
film
when
i
first
poured
it
i
got
a
huge
whiff
of
hops
but
strangely
its
not
there
on
the
first
taste
virtually
no
hop
taste
malty
with
bitterness
a
little
pepper
but
the
hops
is
subdued
after
it
warms
a
little
i
get
some
cedar
and
rosemary
scent
also
a
little
more
cedar
in
the
taste
unusual
beer
o
really
smooth
and
flavorful
exhibits
the
qualities
of
a
traditional
ipa
with
a
nice
twist
from
the
cedar
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
on
a
take
home
scale
i
would
leave
this
on
the
shelf
for
another
day
other
than
that
really
nice
stuff
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
but
it
works
with
the
heavy
cedar
flavors
here
its
also
a
quite
drinkable
beer
i
really
liked
this
one
its
a
unique
take
on
the
ipa
style
with
heavy
herbal
aspects
you
rarely
find
in
something
like
this
recommended
for
lovers
of
herbal
aspects
or
cedar
a
nice
brew
but
does
not
do
much
for
me
personally
i
wouldnt
reach
for
this
one
in
the
future
but
it
does
drink
rather
easy
d
although
i
rather
liked
this
beer
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
in
an
evening
maybe
its
the
richness
lovely
beer
though
bottle
solicited
from
mediya
japanese
supermarket
liang
court
at
clarke
quay
singapore
a
unique
beer
from
hitachino
their
beers
tend
to
have
an
interesting
taste
in
this
case
im
not
sure
if
its
the
yeast
the
cedar
casks
or
the
hopes
but
either
way
i
like
it
essentially
it
is
a
solid
ipa
funkedup
a
little
in
a
good
way
a
very
nice
and
complex
beer
from
kiuchi
brewery
ill
try
some
of
their
other
offerings
when
i
get
the
chance
piney
citrus
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
the
semihigh
abv
is
unnoticeable
but
its
heavy
musty
woody
flavor
make
it
far
from
session
worthy
i
liked
this
beer
but
as
another
reviewer
had
said
its
one
and
done
dont
really
want
another
one
of
these
for
a
while
still
a
very
interesting
beer
which
im
glad
i
tried
perhaps
a
bit
too
woody
and
musty
for
my
taste
definitely
worth
experiencing
i
may
get
it
again
in
a
couple
months
for
another
go
d
i
was
a
little
surprised
by
the
sharp
mouth
feel
but
the
flavours
do
make
for
a
unique
ipa
the
hops
are
featured
but
not
over
the
top
and
the
cedar
again
is
subtle
but
present
goes
down
decently
for
7
abv
overall
very
drinkable
another
nice
product
from
this
brewery
d
things
just
arent
working
here
for
me
the
wood
is
too
strong
that
its
taking
away
from
the
beer
instead
of
adding
to
it
ive
like
everything
else
from
hitachino
but
this
one
will
get
passed
over
by
me
overall
i
found
this
to
be
an
interesting
beer
but
the
flavors
didnt
work
terribly
well
together
everything
felt
like
it
could
be
taken
up
just
a
notch
including
the
wood
influence
still
its
worth
a
shot
to
see
for
yourself
it
was
my
first
beer
from
kiuchi
and
i
was
impressed
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
certainly
isnt
an
english
ipa
but
it
suits
the
name
japanese
classic
ale
as
it
strikes
me
as
the
kind
of
flavour
profile
i
associate
with
traditional
japanese
food
a
very
unusual
and
hard
to
describe
for
the
style
beer
the
pepper
essence
obfuscating
a
lot
of
what
is
actually
going
on
in
the
end
the
cigarfriendly
wood
conditioning
helps
to
mollify
the
peppery
astringency
making
for
a
rather
drinkable
if
still
weirdly
intense
offering
might
have
to
try
this
again
to
really
grok
whats
going
on
here
no
idea
why
this
is
classified
as
any
sort
of
ipa
for
some
reason
my
bottle
says
that
it
is
7
5
alcohol
not
7
dark
orange
color
with
a
nice
head
smells
of
sake
and
wines
taste
its
just
fantastic
it
warms
up
your
palate
slowly
and
then
you
can
taste
some
of
the
alcohol
this
is
sake
meets
beer
this
beer
is
matured
in
cedar
casks
that
are
used
in
brewing
tradition
sake
very
nice

is
a

their
beers

them

a
large
foamy

is

different
interpretation
of
the

with

nicely
d
an
interesting
ale
thats
definitely
worth
a
try
not
necessarily
something
i
would
session
though
i
had
dinner
last
night
at
dbgb
on
manhattans
lower
east
side
and
its
a
great
place
great
beers
amazing
food
i
highly
recommend
it
among
the
beers
i
had
was
one
the
waiter
recommended
the
ipa
really
good
beer
and
now
what
i
expected
from
this
brewery
which
is
better
known
for
unique
tasting
beers
this
is
a
pretty
classic
ipa
maybe
even
a
double
ipa
and
i
will
definitely
get
it
again
this
one
drinks
very
easy
could
be
a
nice
session
beer
this
is
one
tasty
beer
glad
to
get
the
chance
to
try
it
on
tap
i
like
this
a
lot
but
the
imbalance
does
mean
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
time
drinkability
this
one
could
get
you
in
trouble
because
it
says
7
abv
on
the
bottle
but
its
so
crisp
and
refreshing
that
one
just
wont
do
it
besides
the
cute
owl
on
the
bottle
is
telling
me
to
go
grab
another
and
this
dude
abides
what
an
unusual
beer
but
a
deeply
enjoyable
one
crisp
and
rather
refreshing
its
certainly
not
an
ipa
in
the
traditional
sense
as
its
classified
here
but
id
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
better
categorisation
for
it
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
i
was
quite
intrigued
by
and
would
love
to
drink
again
very
mellow
and
easy
to
drink
please
try
this
beer
if
you
get
the
chance
a
great
rendition
of
a
uk
ipa
with
mind
melting
innovations
that
make
it
so
damn
tasty
rounded
mellow
and
drinkable
if
this
were
available
all
the
time
it
would
be
my
goto
ipa
i
liked
this
offering
these
guys
continue
to
impress
the
heck
out
of
me
i
dont
have
their
beers
that
often
but
when
i
do
im
always
impressed
with
them
strong
but
appropriate
carbonation
a
bit
too
bitter
but
not
bad
honestly
if
someone
gave
me
a
glass
of
this
i
might
be
tempted
to
guess
that
it
was
some
sort
of
farmhouse
ale
perhaps
this
bottle
was
spoiled
or
badly
handled
while
it
didnt
taste
bad
it
was
pretty
far
removed
from
what
i
was
expecting
drinkability
unique
beer
with
character
and
worth
a
try
very
drinkable
good
drinkability
although
a
little
thick
for
the
style
its
a
bright
peachylight
orange
colour
with
a
woodyearthy
smokey
aroma
with
touches
of
citrus
and
spiciness
again
quite
a
unique
aroma
not
out
there
like
the
red
rice
you
can
really
smell
that
cedar
aging
ive
only
heard
of
one
other
brewing
practising
cedar
aging
theyre
in
the
states
and
i
forget
the
brewerys
name
when
you
drink
it
you
can
start
to
detect
the
hops
and
the
smokiness
picks
up
the
cedar
is
there
throughout
the
whole
thing
with
a
light
sweet
malt
mingled
with
it
its
beautifully
balanced
smooth
a
delight
drinkability
good
ive
been
hanging
out
to
try
this
brew
ever
since
my
favourite
bottleshop
cellarbrations
carlisle
said
they
were
getting
their
hands
on
someit
pours
a
nice
orangecopper
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
a
one
finger
creamy
head
and
some
decent
lacing
here
and
therethe
aroma
is
really
different
and
nice
aswell
at
the
same
time
it
has
hints
of
pineappleapplebubblegum
and
cedar
definately
makes
itself
well
knownit
has
a
nice
easy
mouthfeel
which
is
very
sessionable
and
has
tastes
of
applepeachpiney
hops
and
of
course
cedarto
be
quite
honest
i
know
this
is
a
japenese
version
of
an
english
ipa
but
its
definately
up
there
with
the
best
of
the
english
ipas
in
my
catergory
and
i
highly
recommend
a
unique
beer
the
cedar
aspect
of
this
one
really
appealed
to
me
notes
very
interesting
and
unique
flavors
at
least
to
me
well
worth
trying
d
a
good
beer
but
weird
especially
if
the
style
is
ipa
very
smooth
d
very
interesting
beer
that
i
would
love
to
try
again
funny
this
beer
tastes
more
like
a
petrus
aged
pale
that
an
ipa
drinkablity
not
overly
hopped
but
an
interesting
ipa
a
challenging
blend
of
flavors
d
a
solid
beer
that
offers
a
fine
alternative
to
the
more
commonly
available
japanese
lagers
while
probably
not
my
personal
preference
in
the
way
of
an
ipa
i
did
appreciate
the
japanese
approach
to
an
ipa
im
not
quite
sure
what
to
think
of
this
beer
except
that
i
like
it
even
though
my
brain
doesnt
quite
agree
with
me
all
the
factors
as
odd
as
some
are
come
together
and
work
together
although
not
something
i
can
have
on
a
regular
basis
but
worth
revisiting
this
time
around
quirky
is
a
good
thing
very
nice
example
of
the
style
that
gets
a
japanese
take
this
is
actually
more
drinkable
than
a
few
other
examples
ive
had
well
done
drinkability
this
is
my
third
hitachino
offering
all
have
been
very
unique
beers
and
wellworth
trying
d
very
unusual
i
wouldnt
drink
this
a
lot
or
often
ill
say
it
does
age
fairly
well
and
if
youre
into
vintage
and
run
across
it
its
worth
a
try
pours
an
interested
cloudy
amber
with
a
thick
eggshell
head
that
lingers
mild
laceing
the
aroma
is
a
delicate
blend
of
caramel
malt
and
flowery
hops
entertwined
the
cedar
is
present
around
the
edges
the
flavor
starts
with
malt
sweetness
bursting
into
flowery
hops
with
a
touch
of
dry
honey
before
a
crisp
cedery
finish
the
hops
are
not
overstated
like
many
in
this
style
and
the
cedar
adds
an
exra
which
complements
the
hops
and
finishes
this
beer
very
very
well
its
a
little
oily
but
the
brightness
of
the
cedar
and
the
dryness
honey
finish
overcome
it
well
im
nearing
the
end

extra
points
for
haveing
a
really
cool
looking
bottle
painted
owl
dude
and
wishing
i
had
more
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
thats
because
its
a
unique
style
and
my
first
taste
of
it
or
because
its
not
very
good
ipa
aged
in
cedar
it
probably
just
not
my
style
this
beer
starts
out
light
sweet
with
flavors
of
hops
and
ends
with
nice
bitter
touch
like
a
typical
ipa
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
a
likeable
bitter
end
overall
a
very
decent
effort
d
this
is
a
nice
brew
its
almost
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
d
not
exactly
sessionable
due
to
the
fact
that
this
is
such
a
unique
and
different
beer
still
fairly
drinkable
ill
definitely
grab
one
of
these
again
watch
out
for
gushers
with
this
one
i
cracked
a
cold
bottle
just
like
i
always
do
but
foam
erupted
right
away
and
caused
a
bit
of
a
mess
i
only
lost
a
couple
ounces
though
and
it
calmed
down
right
away
once
in
the
glass
it
was
a
hazy
orange
with
a
fluffy
eggshell
coloured
cap
good
head
retention
with
a
bit
of
chunky
lace
interesting
aroma
a
combination
of
spicy
wood
and
floral
character
theres
a
mild
nutmeg
component
and
hint
of
citrus
the
wood
aging
was
a
little
overdone
in
the
flavour
too
much
cedar
and
wood
resin
along
with
a
dry
astringency
but
the
hops
werent
completely
overwhelmed
bitterness
was
light
as
was
malt
sweetness
notes
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
appeared
midpalate
slight
warmth
in
the
finish
the
carbonation
died
down
quite
quickly
starting
very
high
but
becoming
a
bit
low
after
10
minutes
or
so
overall
its
an
interesting
beer
but
the
wood
was
too
much
for
me
if
it
was
brought
into
balance
it
would
be
really
good
rather
than
a
bit
better
than
average
i
have
never
heard
of
kiuchi
brewing
now
i
am
on
a
quest
to
find
more
an
absolute
treat
to
try
on
draft
id
almost
say
you
could
session
this
ill
have
to
lay
into
a
whole
six
pack
next
time
i
find
it
and
try
it
out
more
of
a
bitter
than
a
ipa
to
me
d
i
must
get
more
i
had
the
hitachino
nest
red
rice
and
the
white
ale
and
was
only
mildly
impressed
but
this
this
is
excellent
at
7

you
are
not
going
to
pound
this
but
it
is
still
very
much
enjoyable
my
compliments
to
this
japanese
brewer
how
can
this
be
this
underrated
overall
its
good
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
i
wont
be
in
a
rush
to
get
back
to
it
though
served
very
cold
and
poured
into
a
tulip
two
fingers
of
resilient
billowing
white
head
formed
supported
by
the
glass
and
lively
effervescence
dull
copper
colored
liquid
with
visible
yeast
sediment
the
cedar
smell
is
surprisingly
obvious
and
strong
also
smells
of
grapes
and
apples
taste
is
tart
with
cedar
and
and
some
finishing
hops
predominating
just
a
hint
of
malts
near
the
end
a
pretty
straightforward
beer
in
taste
dry
and
light
mouthfeel
interesting
beer
to
try
for
the
cedar
but
not
really
the
most
pleasing
overall
id
say
this
beer
is
quite
rich
and
flavorful
if
you
read
the
front
label
and
ignore
the
back
then
this
is
a
very
nice
real
ale
offering
trying
to
label
this
beer
as
an
ipa
is
quite
dangerous
because
the
style
guidelines
are
written
around
the
american
adaptation
of
this
style
id
say
hitochinos
nest
is
shooting
for
one
of
those
neat
camra
labels
on
their
bottle
drinkability
i
have
never
tasted
another
beer
quite
like
this
one
to
say
it
is
complex
in
aroma
and
taste
is
an
understatement
this
one
grew
on
me
as
i
tasted
it
and
could
have
several
i
think
this
is
a
must
beer
if
not
just
for
its
uniqueness
notes
this
is
an
unusual
beer
but
what
did
i
expect
from
hitachino
i
think
i
like
it
but
would
like
to
try
it
again
another
day
maybe
with
some
food
but
what
to
pair
it
with
yikes
overall
quite
an
interesting
beer
the
drinkability
score
suffers
a
bit
from
the
medicinal
alcohol
flavor
but
the
lovely
aroma
and
the
novelty
of
the
cedar
which
lingered
pleasantly
long
after
the
glass
was
empty
i
still
can
taste
the
forest
on
my
lips
make
this
one
id
gladly
try
again
even
given
the
price
tag
this
poured
a
slightly
hazy
copper
color
with
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
mulling
spices
and
cloves
with
overripe
apple
and
orange
it
tasted
like
sweet
orange
and
overripe
apple
with
mulling
spices
and
green
peppercorns
and
honey
malt
and
a
bit
of
sweet
brandy
oak
and
rice
malt
it
was
fairly
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
sweet
and
spiced
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
very
unique
taste
thats
well
constructed
and
pretty
enjoyable
it
was
clean
had
good
body
and
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
if
you
like
cider
you
would
probably
really
enjoy
this
beer
overall
a
decent
beer
but
a
little
disappointing
i
happen
to
know
that
the
bottle
i
tasted
had
been
on
the
shelves
quite
a
while
so
another
tasting
may
be
in
the
cards
for
now
i
think
ill
stick
with
hitachinos
white
ale
and
red
rice
mfd
a
bit
thin
for
an
ipa
could
be
a
bit
thicker
for
me
the
drinkability
though
is
unhampered
by
the
feel
and
carbonation
the
only
thing
that
holds
it
back
is
how
odd
the
taste
is
green
bottles
why
oh
why
this
might
be
an
amazing
beer
but
i
have
a
feeling
ive
missed
out
on
ever
really
finding
out
edit
seemed
more
like
an
american
ipa
than
an
english
ipa
got
a
bottle
of
this
on
sunday
cracked
it
open
and
wow
smelled
like
grandmas
house
with
the
cedar
chests
for
keeping
the
moths
out
i
am
not
really
much
for
wood
emphasis
beers
so
this
one
left
me
kind
of
ambivalent
but
it
had
an
interesting
sake
aftertaste
for
me
that
kept
me
interested
enough
to
finish
it
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
great
beer
i
know
that
we
are
supposed
to
rate
based
on
true
to
style
cedar
its
interesting
apple
and
spice
flavor
is
quite
tart
and
is
dominated
by
apple
because
of
the
aging
in
cider
casks

but
you
can
taste
it
and
it
does
add
to
the
diversity
of
the

pours
a
murky
orangish
amber
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite

that
possesses
some
solid
lacing
and
retention
qualities
the
aroma
is
a
bit
sour
and
musty
with
some
noticeable
wood
characteristics
from
the
cedar
aging
the
cedar
is
very
apparent
in
the
taste
as
well
but
really
not
in
a
bad
way
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
for
its
uniquenesses
it
is
not
something
that
i
would
want
to
drink
very
often
but
it
is
really
unlike
any
other
beer
that
i
have
tried
which
gives
it
points
in
my
book
definitely
worth
a
try
not
sure
if
making
it
in
cedar
casks
is
the
culprit
but
something
wasnt
right
i
didnt
pick
up
much
cedar
nor
ipa
flavor
and
the
overall
product
couldnt
rescue
this
beer
no
matter
the
style
i
didnt
hate
this
beer
but
it
was
a
challenge
to
finish
and
enjoy
pours
a
glowing
orange
pour
with
a
moderate
offwhite

smell
is
musty
woodsy
and
perhaps
a
touch
fruity
taste
is
dry
musty
and
woodsy
overall
with
a
nice
bitterness
in
the
finish
mild
hop
flavor
overall
for
an
ipa
and
it
definitely
has
a
unique
woody
flavor

beer
i
could
drink
one
after
another
and
not
get
bored
perhaps
not
a
session
beer
but
great
to
sit
and
drink
a
few
and
discuss
with
beer
friends
d
the
abundance
of
big
but
not
overwhelming
hop
flavor
helps
to
make
this
a
highly
drinkable
brew
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
though
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
the
aroma
is
a
weak
point
it
is
nice
but
for
some
reason
far
too
weak
i
think
the
cedar
adds
some
distinct
flavor
components
woodiness
and
tobacco
but
it
is
subtle
enough
that
it
may
only
be
a
psychological
effect
if
you
want
a
new
take
on
an
old
classic
this
one
is
certainly
recommended

thanks
to
timmy

the
buyer
there
for
the
sample
the
beer
has
a
nicely
rounded
amber
body
with
plenty
of
large
bubbled
carbonation
and
a
small
offwhite
head
that
forms
a
constant
smattering
of
lace
during
the
whole
of
consumption
the
nose
is
hugely
floral
tons
of
perfumy
hops
like
crushed
marigolds
and
citrus
rinds
taste
is
also
has
a
well
rounded
body
showing
depth
and
character
floral
and
aromatic
hops
throughout
bitter
finish
like
a
tangerine
rind
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
stimulating
malt
body
is
light
but
present
are
these
unique
characteristics
from
rice
if
so
more
breweries
should
take
up
this
practice
a
very
nice
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amber
orange
citric
nose
with
slight
bubble
gum
tones
it
seems
flavor
is
smooth
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
that
does
not
overpower
even
citric
tones
there
as
well
feel
is
good
with
a
nice
bubble
to
it
definitely
drinkable
a
nice
smooth
brew
with
even
qualities
my
first
hitachino
glad
to
have
gotten
to
try
it
not
sure
if
id
ever
go
back
to
it
because
of
the
price
but
it
was
pretty
decent
you
cannot
sense
that
this
is
high
gravity
ale
there
is
certainly
an
art
to
this
a
clean
oak
cedar
taste
prevalent
a
smoothness
a
lack
of
big
distracting
low
end
that
screams
for
a
sashimi
combo
and
some
negimaki
a
very
clean
taste
that
begs
to
be
drunk
some
more
hey
my
glass
is
empty
already
defiantly
a
beer
to
drink
after
a
sauna
session
another
interesting
beer
from
the
good
folks
at
the
kiuchi
brewery
i
never
would
have
thought
that
a
cedaraged
ipa
would
work
but
it
definitely
does
this
beer
is
quite
complex
and
tasty
its
not
one
that
i
will
be
drinking
frequently
but
it
would
be
nice
for
an
occasional
change
of
pace
id
suggest
trying
it
for
it
uniqueness
if
nothing
else
recommended
a
solid
amber
color
brew
with
a
big
white
foamy
head
and
very
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
pleasant
light
flowery
cherry
scent
the
first
taste
is
a
refreshing
mouthful
of
biscuit
and
dry
grapefruit
hops
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
get
the
sweet
cherry
suggestion
which
occasionally
notes
other
fruit
flavors
while
holding
a
nice
subtle
ale
maltiness
i
thought
this
was
intriguing
not
sure
how
much
i
would
want
to
drink
at
one
sitting
probably
not
more
than
a
couple
based
on
the
unique
flavor
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
first
experience
and
will
want
to
try
it
again
along
with
some
more
selections
from
this
asian
brewer
recommended
for
a
try
although
you
may
find
it
a
little
pricey
drinkability
not
an
everyday
brew
but
i
definitely
like
the
effect
of
the
cedar
and
overall
the
beer
is
quite
complex

for
a
330ml
bottle
from
tullys
beer
and
wine
wells
me
it
smooth
but
has
that
hop
texture
like
the
american
style
thats
really
why
i
dont
favor
english
styles
because
of
the
mellow
texture
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
tan
head
in
the
nose
cedar
wood
and
slightly
lactic
in
the
taste
a
nice
small
presence
of
a
grapefruity
hop
and
a
woody
cedar
taste
a
smooth
beer
with
a
nice
bitter
aftertaste
it
actually
taste
bigger
that
it
is
in
alcohol
interesting
flavors
with
cedar
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
such
an
experimental
brew
unlike
anything
ive
had
yet
and
considering
that
not
half
bad
an
experiment
gone
right
this
is
a
unique
and
delicious
beer
count
me
as
a
huge
fan
dont
know
that
i
can
really
call
this
all
that
drinkable
this
is
unique
to
say
the
least
but
it
is
in
no
way
as
refreshing
as
your
average
pale
ale
a
novelty
beer
in
my
book
d
actually
quite
drinkable
for
the
ragion
and
style
highly
recommended
quite
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
i
can
see
this
getting
lower
reviews
from
those
expecting
a
straight
english
ipa
its
not
meant
to
be
one
very
enjoyable
im
never
disappointed
with
the
hitachino
nest
beers
they
craft
some
quality
brews
d
very
good
it
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
with
a
mild
flavor
that
is
still
unique
enough
to
be
worth
seeking
out
this
kiuchi
brewery
is
pretty
awesome
not
your
typical
7
abv
english
ipa
very
original
on
account
of
the
use
of
cedar
casks
and
very
tasty
pours
a
gorgeous
translucent
golden
amber
cloudy
with
sediment
topped
by
a
thick
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
just
a
dusting
on
top
of
the
liquid
very
fruity
aroma
lots
of
citrusy
notes
like
strawberrylimeorange
juice
and
dusty
blackpeppar
spiciness
not
very
woody
but
i
would
assume
the
spiciness
comes
from
the
cedar
influence
on
the
palate
sharp
juiciness
and
big
carbonation
first
off
then
some
citrus
tobacco
notes
and
pepper
big
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
sharp
citric
hops
and
a
distinct
lack
of
smoothness
imparted
by
barrels
this
beer
is
the
antithesis
of
american
beers
aged
in
wood
barrels
rather
than
slick
and
heavy
it
is
light
and
fresh
quite
good
and
very
interesting
well
done
d
this
beer
is
a
nice
soft
and
subtle
pale
ale
with
no
real
notice
of
flavor
from
the
cedar
forgive
that
rhyme
the
first
thing
i
noticed
in
the
aroma
flavor
and
finish
was
pepper
white
pepper
to
be
exact
it
was
very
strong
in
the
finish
there
was
a
wild
spiciness
that
was
intriguing
but
not
at
all
overpowering
there
was
some
sake
influence
to
the
flavor
as
well
behind
all
the
pepper
and
sake
flavors
the
cedar
taste
really
starts
to
develop
as
it
warmed
and
i
worked
my
way
through
the
beer
the
cedar
really
started
becoming
prominent
it
had
a
creamy
bitter
body
this
was
very
interesting
and
delicious
a
certain
cloying
richness
as
i
referred
to
in
the
smell
perhaps
from
the
cedar
cask
maturation
i
would
say
keeps
this
one
out
of
session
territory
an
odd
little
pale
ale
worth
checking
out
though
not
something
i
would
buy
much
of
you
gotta
love
that
little
owl
though
drinkability
darn
near
4
for
a
little
stubby
12ounce
bottle
but
a
super
beertasting
candidate
ill
have
to
buy
a
few
of
these
just
to
open
a
few
eyes
overall
a
nice
beer
easy
drinking
ipa
for
sure
im
not
all
that
confident
i
got
the
freshest
bottle
since
there
is
no
date
on
the
bottle
a
good
beer
but
this
brewers
wit
is
still
tops
in
my
book
very
interesting
and
pleasant
but
too
expensive
for
merely
an
interesting
and
pleasant
brew
the
odd
flavor
really
bitchslapped
me
at
first
i
assume
it
is
from
the
cedar
aging
but
it
took
a
few
moments
and
a
few
sips
to
get
past
that
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
no
off
flavors
or
smells
noted
this
is
an
unexpectedly
highly
drinkable
beer
overall
i
am
a
little
suprised
at
this
beer
i
expected
to
like
it
but
i
didnt
expect
to
like
it
this
much
i
guess
one
thing
is
that
i
dont
drink
too
many
english
ipas
but
i
do
thing
the
cedar
aging
makes
this
a
nice
unique
beer
very
good
if
they
dont
get
it
thats
ok
more
for
the
magyar
extremely
carbonated
this
bottle
suffered
a
brief
eruption
when
opened
after
settling
down
i
gave
it
a
try
the
brew
is
topped
with
a
huge
rocky
head
while
the
liquid
is
slightly
orange
and
very
hazy
the
aroma
is
interesting
with
a
slightly
tart
citric
quality
this
is
joined
with
a
rustic
earthiness
a
little
wood
i
couldnt
discern
cedar
but
it
was
certainly
wood

though
not
quite
oaklike
fresh
nuts
like
chestnutsmaybe
tannin
and
yeast
the
taste
is
quite
dry
with
a
resiny
bitterness
that
at
times
seems
a
little
harsh
the
wood
quality
is
present
throughout
the
beer
theres
a
bit
of
astringency
and
quite
a
lot
of
the
citric
quality
in
the
finish
this
is
certainly
an
interesting
beer
but
it
seemed
pretty
jumbled
and
chaotic
the
taste
had
hints
of
cedar
smoke
mild
hops
mild
citrus
and
some
roasted
malts
the
feel
however
was
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
carbonation
made
a
biting
feel
at
first
but
this
quickly
faded
into
a
bland
and
mildly
sour
finish
in
my
opinion
this
had
real
potential
but
was
killed
by
a
weak
feel
hitachino
nest
japanese
classic
ale
cedar
aged
pours
a
cloudly
light
amber
color
at
least
it
would
if
it
werent
all
foam
i
popped
the
cap
turned
and
walked
away
for
thirty
seconds
came
back
and
found
the
bottle
overflowing
all
over
the
place
this
bottle
has
been
gently
handled
and
has
sat
in
my
fridge
for
a
month
before
drinking
so
the
gusher
came
as
quite
a
surprise
the
beer
came
in
an
eleven
point
two
ounce
brown
bottle
the
smell
is
fantastic
you
can
smell
some
cedar
in
it
the
beer
does
have
some
ipa
notes
to
it
but
its
not
a
traditional
english
ipa
this
beer
definitely
smells
better
than
it
tastes
not
to
say
its
bad
just
not
as
good
as
its
aroma
definitely
worth
a
try
just
be
careful
when
opening
drinkabilty
an
unusual
beer
that
i
found
rather
disagreeable
strange
beer
but
good
beer
the
cedar
aging
is
a
nice
touch
and
really
makes
this
worth
trying
the
nose
gets
better
as
you
go
on
a
good
drinking
beer
but
one
is
enough
bomber
overall
a
good
interpretation
of
the
english
ipa
style
with
an
interesting
woodiness
hard
to
say
about
drinkability
on
the
one
hand
this
is
a
truly
unusual
beer
and
very
flavorful
im
glad
i
tried
it
on
the
other
the
cedar
is
really
a
little
too
intense
for
me
to
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
that
doesnt
mean
i
wont
be
back
for
more
though
i
rank
this
as
one
of
the
more
unique
brews
currently
being
produced
if
this
is
an
english
ipa
style
its
like
no
other
ive
ever
had
not
even
close
definitely
a
unique
beer
ive
never
really
had
anything
like
it
but
its
flavors
are
somewhat
harsh
and
unblended
its
a
sipper
and
not
easy
to
get
through
d
cedar
flavor
is
a
bit
over
the
top
and
wont
leave
the
palate
didnt
care
for
this
beer
started
out
on
the
wrong
foot
and
never
really
got
good
certainly
unique
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
this
isnt
something
id
regularly
spend
3
50bottle
for
but
a
solid
beer
out
of
japan
a
very
unique
and
pleasing
beer
well
worth
the
9
a
bomber
im
glad
i
went
out
on
a
limb
for
this
one
you
should
do
the
same
it
was
strange
and
unique
and
i
dont
really
want
to
try
it
again
poured
a
a
hazed
peach
with
a
nice
tight
well
retained
white
headaromas
are
somewhat
muted
in
my
mind
the
cedar
notes
show
thru
as
well
as
a
herbal
english
hop
note
but
not
really
anything
that
sticks
out
flavors
seem
somewhat
muted
as
well
with
the
cedar
dominating
but
its
not
overly
strong
if
that
says
anythingthe
hop
profile
is
not
in
your
face
by
any
means
herbalgrassy
notes
mainly
with
a
very
dry
crackerlike
malt
base
an
uninspiring
brew
but
not
overly
bad
just
wouldnt
buy
again
medium
body
decent
abv
good
carbonation
and
a
slippery
smooth
mouthfeel
make
this
an
ale
thats
easy
drinkin
and
worth
try
for
its
uniqueness
it
had
a
orangey
brown
look
beautiful
smell
of
lighty
citrus
cedar
and
caramel
all
blended
well
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
all
three
blended
well
and
arriving
on
the
tongue
in
waves
creamy
feel
in
the
mouth
almost
too
drinkable
i
just
wish
the
price
tag
was
a
little
lower
5
for
12oz
is
too
high
for
me
to
make
this
a
habit
the
aroma
is
strong
with
cedar
notes
and
then
very
faint
notes
of
caramel
malt
dark
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
firm
and
lasting
thumb
thick
white
head
smooth
caramel
malt
in
the
fore
is
quickly
followed
by
spicy
cedar
notes
that
affect
both
sweeter
italian
vanillin
flavors
as
well
as
medium
spiciness
the
wood
flavor
is
sharp
and
pervasive
and
adds
an
element
ive
not
found
in
any
other
beer
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
hoppiness
but
it
melds
together
with
the
cider
notes
as
they
both
touch
on
resiny
and
piney
flavors
thought
there
is
no
mistaking
the
cedar
presence
this
was
a
truly
unique
and
rewarding
suprise
damn
nice
beer
vastly
underrated
in
my
opinion
this
beer
delivers
a
serious
punch
in
the
kisser
the
perfumy
woodsy
aroma
smacks
ya
upside
the
head
even
before
you
get
a
chance
to
look
at
the
glass
murky
rust
colored
with
good
head
retention
by
the
way
smells
promise
a
floral
cider
bittering
and
flavor
where
the
hops
should
be
enough
malt
to
make
the
beer
palatable
and
rounded
but
the
story
here
is
the
solid
hop
flavors
with
the
cedar
amplifying
the
boquet
and
offering
another
bittering
character
ive
never
ate
a
pine
cone
before
but
now
i
understand
what
it
would
be
like
orange
leather
large
bubbly
and
frothy
white
head
that
lasts
fresh
aromas
of
cut
grapefruit
cedar
mango
and
lemon
rinds
wow
a
simply
wonderful
coating
hop
and
fruit
flavor
notes
of
pineapple
fruit
and
grapefruit
but
not
the
overlybitter
and
resinous
kind
of
hop
flavor
in
american
ipas
a
unique
and
lovely
beer
that
i
hope
to
enjoy
many
more
times
edit
try
this
with
a
very
old
cheddar
or
a
smoked
cheese
and
it
will
blow
you
away
nice
bottleconditioned
murky
muddy
yellow
to
amber
plenty
of
lacing
results
from
the
initial
gushing
offwhite
head
resolves
to
a
cover
after
a
few
minutes
incredible
nostrils
punching
pineapple
and
cedar
aroma
pure
spruce
incredible
as
if
it
werent
enough
that
funky
yeast
reminds
me
why
i
love
beer
one
needs
that
every
once
in
a
while
eh
lots
of
citrus
notes
orangey
very
soft
hops
a
treasure
of
an
aroma
unarguably
unique
yet
it
feels
like
an
old
friend
immediately
highly
fruity
floral
makes
me
think
of
spinach
even
and
definitely
algae
firm
and
mellow
bitterness
at
the
same
time
incredibly
tasty
and
aromatic
lots
of
different
range
of
flavours
that
youd
never
think
match
together
but
you
needed
japans
advanced
beer
science
to
come
ahead
with
that
very
small
bubbles
procure
a
biting
bite
everywhere
at
once
but
it
is
comfortable
if
only
for
the
flavors
i
want
more
in
my
mouth
with
every
sip
lightmedium
body
quaffableok
maybe
not
what
most
of
us
have
come
to
expect
from
ipas
but
lets
face
the
facts
or
my
biased
opinion
it
tastes
better
than
any
ipa
ive
had
tremendous
beer
kiuchi
brews
great
beer
white
ale
mediocre
beer
red
rice
ale
and
not
so
good
beer
sweet
stout
japanese
classic
ale
occupies
that
vast
middle
ground
by
its
nature
it
will
be
many
different
things
to
many
different
people
i
can
see
how
some
will
love
it
even
as
others
will
hate
it
im
not
quite
sure
how
i
feel
about
it
but
it
may
just
be
too
strange
for
its
own
good
perhaps
my
bottle
has
matured
i
think
now
that
i
have
read
other
reviews
its
drinkable
yes
interesting
i
suppose
but
many
parts
of
this
are
a
wreck
and
beneath
it
all
lies
a
pretty
weak
stab
at
an
ipa
at
the
very
least
it
is
quite
an
interesting
beer
not
something
that
i
would
drink
every
day
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
once
lightmedium
bodied
and
very
interesting
and
nicely
drinkable
drinkability

this
was
a
decent
rendition
of
cedaraged
english
ipa
but
i
just
didnt
much
care
for
it
the
beer
pours
a
dark
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
there
are
plenty
of
floaties
present
it
has
a
sweet
pale
and
light
crystal
malt
scent
that
seems
a
bit
peppery
it
must
be
the
cedar
casks
the
flavor
is
average
it
has
a
very
bitter
hop
taste
that
is
quite
citrusy
it
boasts
of
pale
malts
and
has
a
slightly
sweet
yet
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
way
too
much
carbonation
this
is
an
average
english
pale
its
way
too
bitter
and
overcarbonated
its
one
and
done
for
me
hoppy
slight
sweetness
balances
out
an
initially
striking
bitterness
followed
by
more
hoppiness
this
is
solid
a
fine
example
of
the
capabilities
of
the
ipa
but
nothing
outstanding
i
always
find
hitachino
beers
really
quirky
and
this
beer
has
impressed
me
more
than
the
rest
of
the
line
i
dont
go
for
ipas
but
this
one
is
pretty
swell
the
mouthfeel
is
full
but
not
overwhelming
carbonation
is
moderate
and
drinkability
is
good
the
relatively
high
alcohol
content
is
very
wellbalanced
especially
with
the
lingering
hoppy
aftertaste
worth
a
look
if
you
are
more
familiar
with
this
style
of
ale
andor
type
of
finish
feel
free
to
drop
me
a
line
this
pup
really
smacks
me
around
a
bit
hard
woodyearthy
up
front
with
just
insane
spices
at
the
end
id
have
to
have
this
beer
everyday
for
a
year
to
figure
out
all
the
complexity
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
im
definately
intrigued
by
and
would
by
again
for
no
other
reason
than
to
try
and
figure
out
what
they
were
trying
to
accomplish
very
nice
beer
and
one
ill
pursue
as
soon
as
i
pop
the
cap
the
beer
tries
to
escape
the
bottle
it
is
incredibly
well
carbonated
with
a
4
finger
thick
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
long
time
the
beer
is
a
fully
hazy
orangish
red
color
that
has
large
chunks
of
yeast
floating
in
it
hmm
healthy
the
cedar
is
immediately
evident
in
the
aroma
quite
interesting
there
is
a
bit
of
fruitiness
here
in
the
nose
as
well
but
it
is
almost
not
perceptible
under
the
cedar
i
get
aromatic
notes
of
strawberry
tamarind
almost
like
a
rose
wine
underneath
the
cedar
the
beer
is
quite
spritzy
up
front
with
a
fruity
acidity
the
finish
is
astringent
and
hoppily
bitter
with
a
long
dry
note
of
cedar
that
dominates
the
finish
there
are
notes
of
cedar
obviously
citrusy
hops
and
mint
this
is
quite
an
interesting
beer
it
is
a
mix
of
solid
hoppiness
and
cedar
d
this
was
an
ok
beer
but
not
a
winner
nothing
i
would
recommend
even
for
a
change
of
pace
very
very
good
and
very
drinkable
i
find
hitachino
beers
can
be
very
hit
or
miss
this
one
is
a
home
run
id
love
to
try
this
with
some
sushi
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
on
first
tasting
hitchino
nests
jca
i
was
reeled
in
by
its
spiciness
and
blown
away
by
its
uniqueness
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
most
original
beers
in
the
world
its
hazy
dark
amber
boddy
teems
with
zesty
bubbles
beneath
a
huge
head
of
frothy
offwhite
foam
that
has
amazing
staying
power
and
leaves
rings
of
thick
fluffy
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
is
amazingly
distinct
and
cedarlike
but
there
are
other
spice
aromas
in
there
as
well
including
some
nutmeg
a
pinch
of
black
pepper
a
brush
of
cinnamon
a
sprig
of
pine
and
a
spritz
of
citrusy
fruit
juice
wow
its
really
interesting
once
its
settled
a
bit
its
airy
in
the
mouth
rather
than
bristling
as
the
sight
of
the
bubbling
carbonation
and
rocky
head
might
suggest
with
a
mediumlight
body
thats
slightly
dextrinous
and
moves
smoothly
across
the
palate
in
the
flavor
the
spices
hit
you
right
upfront
followed
by
a
bit
of
gently
fruity
yeastiness
or
is
that
citrusy
hop
and
a
delicately
sweet
maltiness
thats
similar
to
a
glazed
doughnut
and
wham
theres
the
dry
bitterness
as
some
pine
and
a
slap
of
cedar
reappear
as
the
botterness
fades
from
the
long
finish
some
more
maltiness
becomes
evident
and
some
prickly
spice
appears
its
intriguing
and
complex
but
not
particularily
drinkable
i
prefer
the
cedar
in
the
nose
but
i
guess
the
two
go
hand
in
hand
its
astonishing
and
mesmerizing
in
one
serving
lets
just
leave
it
at
that
pours
with
lots
of
fizz
and
foam
almost
sparkling
like
champagne
the
color
is
a
hazy
yellow
i
enjoyed
this
appearance
even
though
it
doesnt
match
the
style
i
swear
i
could
catch
a
whiff
of
cedar
in
the
aroma
a
fairly
fruity
ale
i
guess
thats
the
english
part
with
a
fairly
sharp
bitterness
accented
by
the
high
carbonation
the
finish
is
a
bit
tart
and
very
dry
this
is
japansese
after
all
theres
an
herbal
quality
that
emerges
as
the
beer
warms
up
in
the
glass
i
really
like
this
beer
probably
becaue
i
like
hoppybitter
beers
that
finish
dry
this
beer
is
a
fary
cry
from
most
english
ipas
that
ive
tasted
but
i
do
like
the
japanese
take
on
the
style
and
the
unusual
used
of
cedar
for
aging
instead
of
oak
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
in
ohio
of
the
weekend
even
though
i
was
warned
about
excessive
carbonation
i
was
not
expecting
the
gusher
that
i
received
from
this
little
bottle
the
gushing
really
tests
ones
patience
eventually
the
beer
settled
down
a
little
yielding
an
extremely
dense
white
foam
head
atop
a
cloudy
orange
body
smell
has
has
wood
notes
which
fight
for
dominance
with
the
hops
nose
is
a
tad
dry
as
well
i
really
got
a
large
dose
of
woodysaltyness
from
my
first
few
tastes
the
saltyness
eventually
fades
away
to
reveal
a
very
crisp
hop
bite
that
ends
up
being
quite
refreshing
and
belies
this
beers
potency
theres
no
doubt
that
this
is
a
very
interesting
ipa
and
if
it
werent
for
the
carbonation
issues
i
would
be
sure
to
pick
more
of
this
up
drinkability
is
damaged
by
the
initial
cat
pee
ill
always
be
leary
of
this
flavor
and
will
definitely
note
proper
spelling
of
the
word
definitely
there
is
no
a
in
the
word
please
learn
to
spell
this
word
if
you
intend
to
write
it
it
is
a
pet
peeve
of
mine
if
ive
misspelled
anything
in
this
review
or
any
other
review
it
is
a
typo
and
not
because
i
dont
know
how
to
spell
be
reluctant
to
try
it
again
the
cedar
doesnt
bother
me
at
all
except
for
the
floaties
anxious
to
try
this
in
the
large
size
got
one
in
my
closet
now
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
a
bit
creamy
nice
bubbly
carbonation
this
is
easy
drinking
and
i
could
easily
have
a
few
however
i
think
id
get
burnt
out
on
the
cedar
after
that
overall
a
very
original
brew
that
i
highly
recommend
to
one
and
all
this
is
an
interesting
and
extremely
complex
beer
from
my
favorite
japanese
brewery
dark
goldenamber
with
a
huge
head
of
rocky
white
foam
nice
lacing
as
well
aromas
are
all
over
the
place
but
very
nice
cedar
hits
hard
up
front
but
you
also
get
pine
needles
sap
citrus
hops
pepper
other
spices
and
more
taste
is
spicy
and
very
fruity
with
a
unique
peppery
fruitiness
and
a
woodladen
splinterlike
dry
finish
unique
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
spritzy
and
nice
drinkability
is
good
but
this
could
get
to
be
too
much
for
your
palate
after
a
couple
as
it
is
another
unique
beer
from
this
very
solid
brewery
the
beer
evacuates
the
330ml
brown
bottle
a
cloudy
copper
color
with
the
head
portly
in
size
and
the
texture
semicreamy
the
color
a
winsome
light
tan
after
its
demise
the
lace
forms
a
thick
and
clinging
sheet
to
circumambient
the
glass
nose
has
a
big
cedar
aroma
spicy
and
fresh
a
different
tone
for
a
beer
with
the
start
sweet
and
the
rice
profile
pleasant
top
is
light
to
middling
in
feel
finish
has
a
delectable
hop
spiciness
and
the
acidity
apropos
to
the
style
once
again
a
treat
and
certainly
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
normal
runofthemill
malt
brews
i
drink
well
worth
a
sample
overall
i
just
cant
make
my
mind
up
on
this
oneone
minute
i
love
it
the
next
i
somehow
find
it
just
too
much
weird
yet
somehow
appealing
edit
i
just
noticed
that
its
7abv
incredibly
drinkable
for
that
alcohol
unreal
actually
i
never
noticed
a
bit
of
alcohol
because
of
all
the
other
weird
stuff
going
on
in
this
one
thanks
to
merlin48
and
clvand0
for
this
beer
making
its
way
to
my
home
this
head
pours
about
4
fingers
with
2
fingers
of
beer
underneath
it
lets
hope
ther
retention
is
not
so
good
but
this
doesnt
look
like
it
will
happen
after
letting
it
sit
the
head
falls
to
reveal
beer
underneath
it
the
nose
is
actually
really
awesome
there
is
nothing
but
cedar
in
there
it
smells
a
lot
like
the
soda
squirt
wtih
some
citrus
notes
but
some
real
peppery
grapefruit
but
not
like
grapefruit
from
hops
damn
i
like
it
but
i
dont
know
why
the
flavor
is
full
on
wood
and
black
pepper
maybe
some
ginger
the
finish
is
really
dry
leaving
my
throat
wanting
some
moisture
wow
i
like
this
beer
the
feel
is
pretty
thick
as
well
letting
me
know
im
drinking
a
nice
beer
drinkability
is
good
on
this
one
as
well
what
a
strange
beer
but
what
a
good
beer
i
sure
hope
i
can
find
this
one
again
nice
nice
beer
very
hazy
beer
plenty
of
loose
sediment
pours
very
lively
gusher
strongly
carbonated
with
a
huge
cap
of
foam
copper
colored
and
murkey
aroma
is
overpowering
cedar
spicy
and
citruicy
flavor
is
hoppy
with
a
fruity
acidic
bitterness
and
a
sappy
wood
flavor
crazy
beer
unique
take
on
an
ipa
great
beer
but
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
more
than
a
couple
this
is
one
funky
beer
had
on
tap
this
past
week
at
redbones
pour
was
the
color
of
dark
tangerine
with
a
tan
head
covering
the
beer
aroma
is
full
of
fruit
but
to
be
honest
i
think
one
notices
the
pepper
and
spice
in
this
one
a
bit
more
taste
is
really
interesting
starts
out
a
bit
sour
intitially
then
finishes
with
grapefruit
but
minus
the
hops
its
like
its
pure
grapefruit
juice
not
an
effect
from
the
type
of
hops
used
medium
mouthfeel
prickly
carbonation
i
think
the
initial
sourness
must
be
coming
from
the
yeast
a
very
unique
tasting
beer
filmy
ghost
of
skree
of
head
to
start
white
grapes
sour
green
apples
and
other
fruity
esters
to
nose
on
the
lighter
side
of
a
cider
appearance
to
hue
with
all
of
the
accompanying
haziness
heated
cracked
black
pepper
to
taste
which
hides
the
tenuous
malt
character
sour
rind
adds
an
undeniable
puckering
quality
and
the
heat
combined
with
other
earthy
qualities
imparts
a
tequila
feel
to
the
pour
this
is
a
funky
offering
with
touches
of
karashi
thrown
in
there

i
want
to
see
more
folks
taking
chances
like
this
one
does
ganbatte
i
had
this
on
tap
at
redbones
the
color
was
hazy
orange
it
appeared
that
it
was
not
or
only
lightly
filtered
it
had
a
full
cream
colored
head
with
a
light
lace
that
maintained
throughout
the
beer
it
had
a
bright
fruity
nose
with
a
hint
of
hop
flower
the
taste
was
not
what
i
expected
along
with
the
hops
you
expect
from
an
ipa
there
was
a
spicy
almost
peppery
taste
up
front
i
couldnt
identify
whether
a
spice
had
been
added
or
if
this
was
from
the
hops
but
it
distracted
me
from
the
flavor
in
fact
this
bite
from
the
spice
overwhelmed
any
malt
character
i
do
feel
the
hops
less
than
taste
them
light
mouth
feel
average
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
wonderful
not
heavily
carbonated
despite
the
misgivings
of
the
gushing
bottle
or
perhaps
this
is
why
its
less
carbonated
i
really
could
drink
this
all
night
and
keep
the
bitter
dryness
of
the
wonderful
cedar
lingering
on
my
tongue
for
a
while
solid
drinkability
if
i
ever
end
up
in
japan
im
going
to
knock
pints
of
this
like
theres
no
flight
out
of
that
floating
world
lots
of
carbonation
huge
head
on
top
of
a
hazy
golden
amber
colored
body
lots
of
lacing
just
be
careful
pouring
it
aroma
is
good
spicey
and
peppery
on
top
of
hops
malty
woody
earthy
smell
also
but
pepper
dominates
taste
is
good
dry
malt
and
cedar
powered
by
intense
carbonation
tingles
the
taste
buds
hops
spice
and
pepper
mingle
together
for
nice
finish
to
a
good
beer
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
lots
of
bubbles
to
elevated
the
spices
drinkability
is
good
nice
tastey
beer
love
the
pepper
and
cedar
in
my
ipa
dont
know
how
this
beer
got
only
a
80
rating
this
is
one
everyone
should
atleast
try
fruit
bread
and
some
caramel
malty
sweetness
are
washed
away
by
a
fresh
pine
and
citrus
hop
bitterness
itself
falling
victim
to
cedar
at
times
the
cedar
actually
gets
lost
as
part
of
the
pine
finish
but
at
other
times
it
becomes
almost
astringent
a
cheekpuckering
product
to
be
sure
drink
this
while
in
different
moods
and
at
different
temps
to
get
the
full
effect
the
cedar
while
part
of
a
cohesive
beer
and
the
cedar
part
as
its
own
raucus
uninvited
flavor
interesting
impressiondrinkability
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
the
cedar
aging
lends
a
unique
character
that
ive
never
before
experienced
definitely
this
will
keep
mothra
away
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
brewerys
sweetlacto
stout
but
this
one
is
a
quality
product
that
is
well
constructed
in
spite
of
the
cedar
slapping
you
in
the
face
sedimented
yeast
locked
in
suspension
medium
bright
brown
color
sparking
head
only
rises
to
14
of
an
inch
but
i
poured
it
in
a
wide
goblet
laces
are
ample
apple
aromas
medium
tart
like
granny
smiths
some
astringent
tones
good
body
a
little
heavy
lower
carbonation
solid
flavor
a
little
atypical
with
fruit
and
decided
pie
spices
including
a
macelike
bittering
and
raisiny
senses
wellbittered
quite
piney
very
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
to
me
the
malt
was
adequate
and
interesting
but
the
hoppiness
slightly
harsh
an
interesting
take
on
an
ipa
derivation
while
not
suberbly
drinkable
to
me
maybe
among
my
favorite
of
the
hitachino
beers
thus
far
the
mouthfeel
was
grainy
smooth
at
the
start
with
a
light
crispness
at
the
finish
nicely
drinkable
and
a
slightly
different
english
style
ipa
pours
a
lazy
hazy
hazy
amber
with
a
huge
thin
white
head
which
flows
where
i
dont
want
it
to
flow
tastes
nice
and
hoppy
but
well
rounded
to
the
malt
flavors
actually
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
beer
and
if
it
were
not
for
the
slight
overcarbination
problems
i
would
have
scored
it
higher
a
solid
mellow
ipa
decent
beer
from
canada
martime
tradition
o
this
certainly
isnt
an
ipa
it
drinks
more
like
a
watered
down
hard
cider
i
serve
this
to
unwanted
guests
who
feel
special
when
i
serve
it
to
them
this
could
not
be
further
from
an
ipa
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
body
taste
is
rife
of
adjuncts
and
corn
with
offsetting
bitterness
not
related
to
hops
small
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
fact
it
carries
the
word
ipa
on
the
label
is
a
joke
kinda
boring
not
bad
tasting
but
not
my
favorite
to
let
everyone
know
this
is
not
a
true
ipa
in
the
sense
that
everyone
on
this
site
is
thinking
this
beer
is
more
akin
to
coors
light
or
beer
of
that
sort
that
being
said
it
is
still
a
decent
beer
for
going
out
and
partying
for
those
who
still
do
so
that
is
this
beer
has
a
sense
of
nostalgia
to
me
it
was
the
first
beer
i
ever
had
and
being
quebecois
and
living
in
the
states
i
miss
it
from
time
to
time
give
it
a
shot
just
keep
my
words
in
mind
if
you
ever
do
happy
drinking
all
does
not
taste
like
an
ipa
i
wouldve
been
better
off
getting
water
not
an
ipa
terrible
beer
more
like
a
mediocre
pilsner
beer
does
not
taste
like
an
ipa
at
all
more
like
a
cheap
light
beer
great
beer
good
taste
better
beer
can
pours
clear
golden
with
a
light
short
lasting
head
despite
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
my
namesake
it
is
a
very
flavourless
beer
it
is
more
like
a
watered
down
mass
produced
lager
rather
than
an
ipa
drinks
more
like
a
pilsner
very
weak
for
a
ipa
but
i
like
it
as
a
canadian
budweiser
basically
good
goto
beer
if
youre
not
sure
what
you
want
to
drink
must
be
served
cold
had
one
that
was
little
warm
not
very
good
when
warm
overall
as
an
ipa
this
certainly
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
if
i
didnt
know
what
this
was
id
probably
guess
some
type
of
light
amber
ale
as
an
alternative
to
the
standard
adjunct
lager
in
a
chain
restaurant
i
wont
complain
this
is
not
an
ipa
this
is
a
much
lighter
beer
and
is
more
typical
of
an
adjunct
lager
or
other
mass
produced
beer
if
i
would
recommend
it
probably
not
overall
pretty
bland
beer
lacking
the
crispness
that
good
examples
of
the
style
usually
have
i
used
to
think
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
while
inoffensive
theres
not
much
exciting
or
different
about
this
one
still
goes
down
easy
enough
on
the
first
hot
and
humid
day
of
2014
being
that
this
is
the
pride
of
nova

ive
had
this
beer
plenty
of
times
so
i
knew
what
i
was
getting
into
the
label
saying
ipa
didnt
surprise
me
this
is
not
an
ipa
at
all
its
a
pretty
good
macro
though
but
alexander
keiths
really
need
to
figure
out
their
styles
of
beer
keiths
dark
ale
used
to
be
called
stag
head
stout
and
that
beer
is
far
from
a
stout
i
think
the
names
are
more
of
a
marketing
gimmick
overall
its
a
good
macro
beer
but
do
not
try
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
ipa
because
this
isnt
one
at
all

this
beer
looks
decent
but
wow
i
decided
to
try
it
on
tap
because
i
had
tried
it
from
can
and
bottle
and
was
so
disappointed
this
beer
tastes
like
salt
to
me
its
disgusting
it
dries
my
mouth
out
tastes
bad
and
is
just
overall
not
a
very
inviting
beer
the
metallic
taste
and
the
bad
aftertaste
is
just
not
something
people
should
have
to
experience
sorry
keiths
youre
just
not
doing
it
for
me
d
i
could
drink
the
whole
pack
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
maybe
a
faded
batch
but
i
have
had
good
experiences
with
faded
ipa
rich
malt
notes
and
hidden
hops
characters
not
found
is
this
brew
ok
its
not
often
i
review
a
beer
as
i
like
drinking
more
then
typing
but
wtf
mate
this
is
no
ipa
i
thought
i
was
in
treat
for
a
local
good
beer
ipa
will
this
will
stand
out
against
the
bud
moosehead
and
other
not
so
tasty
candadian
beers
was
i
ever
wrong
i
though
they
had
for
sure
messed
up
the
draft
towers
after
tasting
this
beer
no
way
is
this
an
ipa
any
way
shape
or
form
i
even
bought
the
same
beer
in
a
bottle
hoping
it
was
just
a
fuxed
up
tap
but
no
its
the
same
out
of
the
bottle
not
and
ipa
more
cream
ale
then
anything
not
what
i
wanted
false
advertising
mateys
now
i
retire
to
bed
off
bad
beed
i
left
when
the
ball
game
was
over
without
finishing
the
minipitcher
left
some
of
the
8
pack
in
the
hotel
when
we
checked
out
brought
1
home
to
make
sure
i
wasnt
being
overly
critical
im
not
stay
away
no
this
is
not
an
ipa
its
really
not
a
good
beer
by
any
expectations
avoid
it
sort
of
makes
me
wonder
what
makes
it
an
ipa
i
would
probably
classify
this
as
an
adjunct
lager
far
sooner
than
i
could
imagine
it
being
an
ipa
this
is
not
an
ipa
i
believe
this
beer
has
set
back
other
ipas
in
canada
because
of
its
popularity
seriously
try
to
mention
an
ipa
to
someone
that
isnt
into
craft
beer
and
they
will
go
oh
like
keiths
i
dont
blame
the
people
i
blame
keiths
for
making
a
golden
ale
and
mislabelling
it
hell
this
beer
probably
caused
me
to
not
bother
trying
other
ipas
for
a
couple
years
because
i
had
no
idea
what
i
was
missing
for
that
i
hate
keiths
yet
it
was
still
the
best
beer
available
when
i
had
it
this
time
overall
i
would
pass
on
this
i
tried
it
i
am
ok
now
d
easy
to
drink
can
put
away
quit
a
few
not
an
ipa
at
all
but
still
enjoyable
crystal
clear
pale
gold
with
a
fizzy
white
cap
that
disappeared
quickly
not
even
a
collar
slightly
sour
and
musty
aroma
faint
cereal
grains
very
low
bitterness
mild
sweetness
with
the
same
sour
character
as
in
the
aroma
slight
fruitiness
short
finish
quite
dry
light
mineral
flavour
light
bodied
moderate
carbonation
dont
drink
this
if
youre
expecting
an
ipa
of
any
type
hops
are
nearly
nonexistent
and
while
its
mostly
inoffensive
it
still
lacks
any
sort
of
character
interesting
this
ipa
well
it
pours
an
ultratranslucent
pale
straw
gold
bud
light
esque
with
a
thin
white
head
that
exhibits
very
little
retention
aroma
is
of
light
corn
notes
and
a
hint
of
mustiness
taste
is
bready
malt
corn
with
maybe
a
slight
touch
of
earthy
spicy
hop
flavor
very
minimal
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
im
drinking
this
coming
in
from
the
golf
course
and
its
hitting
the
spot
despite
its
lackluster
performance
as
an
ipa
it
is
at
least
refreshing
drinkability
this
is
a
hard
one
to
rate
on
the
one
hand
you
could
drink
this
all
day
it
is
light
on
the
tongue
but
so
is
water
this
a
drink
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
but
want
something
that
has
more
body
than
plain
water
plus
a
little
alcohol
had
this
on
a
recent
business
trip
to
toronto
poured
copperamber
with
very
little
head
to
speak
of
no
nose
aside
from
some
nuttiness
and
biscuit
the
flavor
profile
was
even
worse
no
hoppiness
or
fruitiness
to
speak
of
very
thin
too
watery
some
may
thing
that
this
is
sessionable
but
i
had
difficulty
finishing
just
one
i
dont
know
whats
worse
the
fact
that
this
is
an
offensive
objectionable
abominably
awful
rendition
of
a
classic
style
or
that
its
just
an
utterly
disgusting
unpalatable
offering
in
its
own
right
no
its
the
fact
that
they
call
this
an
ipa
when
clearly
its
nothing
more
than
an
industriallyproduced
adjunctridden
macro
lager
and
a
terrible
one
at
that
thoughts
this
is
a
good
beer
for
a
thirst
quencher
not
allot
of
flavor
but
goes
down
smooth
so
if
you
like
budweiser
this
is
the
beer
for
you
glad
that
i
did
not
buy
it
wife
got
it
out
of
a
hotel
room
where
she
works
d
good
for
more
than
one
not
really
an
ipa
but
better
than
the
usual
bmc
offerings
we
all
know
that
keiths
is
not
at
all
representative
of
the
style
that
it
claims
to
be
if
i
were
judging
it
as
a
macro
lager
i
would
likely
give
it
aboveaverage
marks
by
those
standards
its
actually
reasonably
good
and
i
would
virtually
always
pick
it
over
say
canadian
blue
or
bud
if
you
are
looking
for
an
ipa
though
you
might
as
well
look
elsewhere
keiths
ipa
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
slightly
foamy
head
that
fades
quickly
despite
the
heavy
carbonation
the
aroma
is
cooked
corn
and
husky
grain
the
flavor
is
more
cooked
corn
dms
and
pale
grainy
malt
there
is
maybe
a
hint
more
bitterness
than
the
average
macro
alelager
and
maybe
there
is
a
vague
herbal
hop
flavor
but
thats
really
stretching
the
body
is
heavy
relative
to
the
flavor
but
still
pretty
thin
overall
calling
this
beer
an
ipa
is
more
of
a
stretch
than
calling
miller
lite
a
pilsner
its
just
plain
misleading
pours
a
fairly
clear
golden
wheat
colour
with
a
rich
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
oddly
light
for
the
beer
that
it
claims
to
be
the
nose
has
notes
of
corn
on
it
and
a
slight
bitterness
that
seems
oddly
unhoppy
the
body
is
stupidly
light
with
a
crispness
but
no
hop
flavours
or
aromas
i
used
to
drink
this
as
it
had
a
nice
subtle
difference
over
macro
lagers
but
now
that
i
know
ipas
and
good
beers
man
is
it
ever
lacking
the
mouthfeel
is
awful
way
too
carbonated
with
an
astringent
finish
if
this
were
sold
as
an
adjunct
laden
beer
it
may
have
been
better
but
still
this
one
was
a
bit
confusing
although
not
so
much
after
having
tried
the
mike
duggan
9
ipa
another
canadian
brewed
ipa
that
didnt
really
live
up
to
the
style
in
my
opinion
but
this
appeared
to
be
to
much
more
of
a
pale
ale
or
even
a
light
lager
the
color
and
smell
of
the
beer
had
strong
resemblances
to
most
bmctype
beers
the
taste
was
perhaps
slightly
more
hoppy
but
that
may
be
a
stretch
the
beer
was
light
and
honestly
not
really
all
that
enjoyable
i
p
a
as
my
dad
would
say
they
should
be
arrested
for
false
pretenses
it
shares
about
as
much
in
common
with
a
fullbodied
i
p
a
as
metallica
does
with
the
village
people
this
beer
is
weak
this
beer
is
flavourless
no
wait
i
can
taste
some
corn
syrup
and
whats
that
pickle
juice
honestly
i
think
i
taste
hints
of
pickle
juice
no
kidding
i
hope
im
not
having
a
stroke
oh
please
dear
god
make
this
aftertaste
go
away
its
almost
making
me
crave
a
bud
lite
lime
oh
the
humanity
puzzling
saw
this
one
on
the
tap
list
and
said
hey
ipa
ordered
one
up
and
it
arrived
in
an
imperial
pint
a
lager
yellow
color
i
asked
the
barmaid
is
this
the
ipa
yes
sure
yes
ok
first
the
pale
yellow
color
told
me
not
to
be
expecting
much
the
smell
also
a
typical
i
hate
to
say
adjunct
lager
smell
ale
is
even
pushing
it
the
beer
tastes
ok
but
not
for
an
ipa
this
is
nowhere
near
an
ipa
they
sure
saved
some
money
on
hops
on
this
one
where
are
the
hops
it
was
a
good
try
naming
it
an
ipa
but
this
is
a
mild
ale
disguised
as
an
ipa
but
the
disguise
is
not
good
the
mouthfeel
was
good
and
the
beer
is
drinkable
but
what
a
letdown
if
youre
looking
for
a
strong
hoppy
ipa
this
one
isnt
for
you
in
most
instances
few
beerlovers
would
consider
this
an
ipa
if
youre
new
to
canadian
beers
though
and
would
like
to
try
the
beer
that
many
canadians
go
to
the
bar
or
home
to
after
a
day
at
the
office
this
one
is
one
to
try
drinkability
well
this
brew
is
far
from
the
style
and
not
very
inviting
insipid
d
high
for
most
macro
drinkers
but
that
chemical
taste
makes
me
sick
notes
about
the
beer
some
say
that
the
keiths
ipa
is
not
a
traditional
ipa
the
term
pale
ale
originally
denoted
and
ale
which
had
been
brewed
from
pale
malt
it
became
known
as
india
pale
ale
because
of
the
huge
demand
among
the
east
india
company
in
the
18th
century
drinkability
not
so
good
after
two
500
ml
can
bought
at
the
lcbo
poured
a
clear
gold
color
with
about
a
1
foam
head
nothing
really
special
about
it
a
bit
of
sweetness
not
too
bitter
a
bit
watery
this
would
be
a
pretty
good
at
a
bbq
thats
about
it
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
d
better
than
some
but
mostly
forgettable
d
my
least
favorite
of
the
alexander
keith
beers
i
have
tried
to
date
would
not
seek
this
beer
out
when
looking
for
an
ipa
but
not
completely
undrinkable
d
overall
acceptable
but
not
special
this
is
a
steelworkers
dream
you
can
taste
the
plant
in
the
brew
drinkability
this
is
not
and
ipa
this
isnt
even
a
pa
in
fact
this
isnt
even
an
a
this
is
a
lager
if
i
am
to
rate
this
beer
as
an
ipa
i
have
to
give
it
an
f
if
im
going
to
rate
this
for
what
it
is
im
going
to
give
it
a
b
this
is
the
beer
of
my
youth
and
the
fond
memories
attached
to
it
give
it
an
unfair
advantage
still
if
im
forced
to
buy
from
a
cold
beer
wine
this
is
always
my
first
choice
341ml
bottle
poured
into
a
shaker
at
east
side
marios
bright
golden
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
away
smell
is
decent
floral
hops
mild
corngrain
and
other
vague
adjuncts
taste
is
clean
cereal
grains
a
hint
of
yeast
and
lightly
grassy
hops
with
a
subdued
but
noticeable
bitterness
typical
of
the
saaz
hop
variety
crisp
and
lightbodied
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
tingly
spice
from
the
hops
all
of
the
flavours
are
extremely
toneddown
but
this
is
an
acceptable
mainstream
drinker
when
nothing
else
is
available
drinkability
actually
its
pretty
good
id
rate
everything
higher
if
it
were
classed
as
an
american
lager
its
characterful
and
tasty
if
compared
to
those
but
a
very
dull
ipa
drinkability
was
above
average
i
put
away
the
473ml
can
with
no
problem
and
wanted
more
surprisingly
smooth
for
what
it
is
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
and
again
d
its
one
of
the
most
available
beers
at
the
local
pubs
and
is
always
on
special
its
better
than
budweiser
and
kokanee
how
they
advertise
this
as
an
ipa
is
beyond
me
it
makes
me
sad
how
many
people
come
into
my
beer
room
and
tell
me
they
like
ipas
like
keiths
please
dont
buy
this
beer
its
expensive
and
no
good
i
feel
sorry
for
all
the
hop
heads
that
have
bought
this
beer
thinking
they
would
get
something
worth
drinking
drinkability
easy
to
drink
no
doubt
the
kind
of
stuff
youd
drink
to
get
tipsy
on
a
hot
day
its
not
a
horrible
beer
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
was
ok
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
just
that
i
could
have
ordered
a
bud
miller
coors
beer
and
had
the
same
bland
not
bad
not
great
beer
palest
yellow
and
crystal
clear
with
a
tiny
bit
of
foam
that
quickly
fades
into
a
skim
the
nose
is
faint
and
of
sweet
corn
this
beer
tastes
more
like
a
kolsch
than
an
ipa
light
and
mildly
fruity
with
just
the
faintest
suggestion
of
mild
hop
bittering
light
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
a
pathetic
excuse
for
an
ipa
but
not
a
terrible
beer
the
style
is
just
wrong
definatly
not
like
any
ipa
ive
ever
had
could
be
compsred
to
budweiser
although
this
one
has
more
flavor
then
a
bud
its
still
light
and
weak
but
easy
to
drink
drinkability
the
worst
keiths
i
have
tried
most
ipas
i
have
are
somewhat
bitter
this
has
a
touch
of
bitter
on
the
end
but
that
is
it
it
is
weak
and
watery
one
is
more
than
enough
as
this
is
a
huge
disappointment
d
better
from
the
bottle
after
drinking
it
on
tap
something
was
lacking
but
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
it
maybe
i
should
try
it
at
a
different
bar
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
drinking
and
ipa
dont
drink
this
one
ipa
are
you
serious
i
hope
to
find
a
decent
canadian
ipa
for
my
next
canadian
fishing
trip
poured
with
a
very
small
white
head
that
was
gone
almost
immediately
lacing
bah
body
was
completely
clear
and
bright
yellow
very
carbonated
smells
not
good
couldnt
place
it
at
first
but
after
awhile
it
started
resembling
urine
as
for
the
taste
alexander
keiths
has
always
been
college
swill
but
to
claim
to
be
an
ipa
is
an
insult
to
real
ipas
i
dont
really
detect
any
hops
at
all
a
slightly
bitter
finish
that
leaves
the
mouth
feeling
a
bit
dry
is
all
its
not
an
ipa
and
its
not
a
good
beer
not
that
you
cant
get
it
down
its
just
nothing
special
and
offensive
to
claim
that
its
an
ipa
it
looks
like
miller
light
in
the
glass
and
doesnt
tast
that
different
i
have
a
theory
that
all
canadian
beers
are
the
same
and
they
just
change
the
labels
this
alleged
ipa
just
reinforces
my
theory
it
looks
like
a
macro
lager
it
smells
like
a
macro
lager
and
its
an
ipa
eh
basically
this
is
a
canadian
bmc
pours
almost
clear
has
no
hop
aroma
or
bitterness
at
all
i
bought
it
because
it
was
in
a
can
and
appeared
to
possibly
be
a
craft
beer
but
not
not
at
all
i
think
its
better
then
a
miller
but
not
by
much
although
id
rather
support
a
bad
small
company
than
bmc
another
beer
thats
not
really
offensive
just
boring
light
and
moderately
refreshing
maybe
not
for
a
true
english
ipa
but
for
a
traditional
macro
it
drinks
ok
seriously
though
cant
you
do
better
at
the
ballpark
i
didnt
see
it
it
is
something
to
drink
after
cutting
the
lawn
but
other
than
that
i
would
say
spend
your
money
somewhere
else
overall
not
something
id
ever
consider
to
be
an
ipa
i
dont
think
i
will
ever
have
this
beer
again
try
a
different
ipa
and
avoid
this
one
not
an
ipa
in
any
regards
drinkability
not
a
bad
bad
brew
to
bang
back
a
few
just
not
really
an
ipa
as
others
have
said
and
for
the
guy
below
who
said
that
if
you
were
to
give
this
beer
a
rating
less
than
a
there
are
many
that
would
kick
you
out
of
canada
no
i
think
not
there
are
many
would
rather
kick
you
out
of
this
country
for
giving
it
anything
more
than
a
c
final
thoughts
ill
be
honest
ive
yet
to
try
an
india
pale
ale
outside
of
keiths
but
even
i
know
that
this
is
way
to
similar
to
a
standard
lager
for
it
to
be
a
representation
of
the
style
that
being
said
its
still
a
better
then
average
macro
offering
i
wouldnt
buy
a
pack
of
it
to
drink
at
home
but
id
gladly
buy
it
again
at
a
pub
that
only
offered
macro
beers
or
take
it
if
it
was
offered
a
guy
at
work
was
nice
enough
to
bring
one
in
for
me
apparently
a
friend
of
his
went
to
quebec
and
brought
some
back
for
him
im
going
to
tell
him
i
loved
it
since
i
dont
want
to
hurt
his
feelings
but
id
never
drink
one
of
these
on
my
own
due
to
the
fact
i
live
in
halifax
i
drink
quite
a
bit
of
alexander
keiths
first
its
been
around
for
almost
200
years
and
it
shouldnt
be
labeled
as
an
ipa
because
it
clearly
isnt
however
that
does
not
mean
that
it
isnt
an
exceptional
beer
what
it
is
is
a
very
light
refreshing
blond
ale
with
almost
no
hop
aroma
it
has
a
nice
smooth
mouth
feel
with
bit
of
sweetness
it
would
be
a
great
replacement
for
your
common
lagers
in
the
summer
time
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
history
and
im
surprised
it
isnt
more
well
known
outside
of
canada
i
suppose
that
this
goes
down
just
as
well
as
any
massmarket
macro
lager
given
its
striking
similarity
to
them
in
the
past
this
offering
benefited
from
me
being
held
hostage
by
a
lack
of
selection
and
a
general
dearth
of
education
no
longer
am
i
blind
and
i
see
this
for
what
it
really
is
marketing
sheen
and
nothing
else
as
it
has
very
very
little
to
recommend
it
stylewise
or
other
for
a
summer
quencher
it
is
subpar
the
aftertaste
is
way
too
sticky
sweet
for
me
i
much
prefer
a
bit
of
citrus
zing
from
a
wheat
beer
ill
try
my
remaining
bottles
with
a
lemon
or
lime
wedge
maybe
that
will
improve
it
eric
very
light
for
the
style
and
would
be
light
for
a
pale
ale
let
alone
an
ipa
d
it
is
a
very
light
brew
that
would
work
very
well
as
a
hydration
brew
on
a
hot
sweaty
afternoon
pitching
bales
of
hay
this
brewery
should
be
ashamed
overall
weak
lifeless
i
was
really
disappointed
enjoyed
the
brewery
taproom
though
no
detecable
hops
no
aroma
no
bitterness
i
tasted
more
biscuit
malt
than
hops
the
color
was
golden
like
a
budweiser
little
head
but
i
really
didnt
care
about
that
while
there
are
certainly
many
better
beers
out
there
this
is
our
goto
draught
beer
at
bars
or
restaurants
without
any
good
beers
i
picked
up
6
pack
of
this
while
in
canada
recently
because
it
was
the
only
ipa
at
the
beer
store
i
dont
remember
much
about
it
other
than
that
it
could
not
have
been
a
worse
representation
of
the
style
but
other
than
that
tasted
alright
there
were
no
hops
present
in
the
aroma
or
the
taste
if
it
had
not
been
labeled
as
an
ipa
i
may
have
felt
differently
about
this
beer
but
as
is
i
was
very
unhappy
i
will
say
however
that
this
beer
is
great
if
you
just
want
something
to
sit
back
and
drink
without
really
paying
much
attention
to
its
qualities
it
is
a
good
hot
day
beer
and
perfect
im
sure
for
drinking
games
this
beer
tastes
and
looks
a
lot
like
a
light
beer
with
perhaps
a
touch
more
flavor
id
certainly
say
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
just
relaxing
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
however
this
is
absolutely
no
ipa
sweet
watery
some
fruits
and
only
faint
hops
are
present
despise
it
i
had
a
bottle
in
windsor
it
was
the
only
ipa
on
the
menu
but
unfortunately
after
trying
it
i
realize
this
isnt
an
ipa
at
all
there
were
no
noticeable
hops
in
the
aroma
or
taste
this
was
just
an
unassuming
lager
it
wasnt
really
bad
or
offensive
unless
you
count
the
fraudulent
labeling
advertising
this
as
an
ipa
to
appreciate
this
beer
discard
the
idea
that
it
is
an
ipa
its
nothing
like
one
and
i
have
no
idea
why
they
bother
putting
that
on
the
label
second
do
not
drink
this
out
of
a
bottle
its
forte
is
as
a
draft
the
only
time
i
drink
this
is
when
i
am
at
one
of
the
many
establishments
in
ottawa
that
only
serve
macros
on
draft
keiths
draft
is
smoooth
and
has
no
questionable
flavours
its
a
fine
chugging
beer
that
being
said
dont
make
it
your
favourite
beer
unless
you
are
a
big
time
boozer
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
head
that
just
disappeared
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
really
skunked
out
and
thats
about
all
there
was
in
the
nose
the
beer
tasted
like
a
bad
macro
cooked
veggies
adjunct
malt
syrup
and
the
like
there
were
really
no
hops
present
maybe
if
you
searched
hard
in
the
background
there
might
have
been
something
ive
never
had
an
ipa
with
no
hops
in
the
body
i
think
that
says
it
all
this
went
down
the
drain
quickly
d
this
beer
comes
highly
recommended
by
myself
and
i
feel
is
the
perfect
beer
to
enjoy
all
night
long
it
is
definately
a
great
chugging
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
in
the
pub
with
good
friends
ill
have
a
schooner
of
this
no
problem
and
then
another
with
all
the
history
and
quality
behind
this
beer
its
no
wonder
the
good
people
of
nova
scotia
are
so
proud
of
keiths
the
head
is
not
present
which
is
something
i
hate
the
color
is
nice
yellow
smell
nothing
taste
like
a
commercial
beer
which
is
very
disappointing
poured
a
very
light
colored
orangestraw
with
a
bit
of
head
not
much
lacing
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
it
has
a
very
light
hoppy
scent
strong
malts
for
an
ipa
but
at
least
there
was
a
little
bit
of
bitter
aroma
same
for
the
taste
a
lot
of
malt
in
the
initial
taste
with
a
kick
of
hoppiness
at
the
end
not
a
very
strong
ipa
more
of
a
hoppy
yellow
macro
lager
it
did
go
down
fairly
smooth
though
i
guess
my
expectations
werent
that
high
based
on
what
else
was
available
at
the
fridays
in
the
airport
but
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
above
average
beer
nothing
amazing
and
a
little
mild
but
a
decent
well
made
drinkable
beer
a
clear
miss
in
the
ipa
world
overall
this
beer
is
rather
disappointing
i
can
appreciate
a
well
made
english
ipa
and
this
isnt
one
m
nothing
to
it
does
that
make
it
drinkable
to
me
no
im
glad
1
bottle
is
all
i
had
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
pass
on
this
unless
youre
looking
for
an
easy
drinker
im
dumping
it
pours
a
pale
gold
with
excellent
clarity
and
a
thin
one
finger
head
of
fizzy
bubbles
poor
retention
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
shows
some
mild
herbal
hop
notes
and
weak
ricecorn
adjunct
malt
scent
but
overall
understated
and
not
exactly
tostyle
the
flavor
is
in
a
word
bland
the
malt
is
thin
and
mainly
adjunct
driven
almost
like
an
american
standard
lager
the
little
hop
presence
is
known
only
in
the
mild
and
dry
aftertaste
that
has
whispers
of
minty
english
hops
but
the
skunk
character
out
of
the
keg
is
more
apparent
thin
bodied
with
medhigh
to
high
carbonation
this
beer
is
crisp
and
clean
but
not
at
all
a
showcase
of
hops
or
barley
of
course
the
finish
is
clean
and
the
drinkability
is
high
this
may
appeal
to
consumers
who
want
to
look
cool
ordering
an
ipa
but
prefer
a
molson
for
saavy
beeradvocates
who
are
in
the
mood
for
canadas
take
on
the
original
english
import
beware
or
false
advertisement
notes
not
for
me
im
starting
to
think
crisp
clean
macros
are
the
way
to
go
in
this
area
of
atlantic
canada
blehhh
if
this
is
an
ipa
then
im
the
easter
bunny
molson
canadian
can
kick
this
beers
ass
back
to
nova
scotia
the
beer
had
a
nice
carbonation
and
went
down
easy
but
i
was
expecting
more
of
an
ipastyle
as
advertised
way
out
of
style
someone
send
a
search
and
rescue
party
out
for
the
hops
other
than
style
lackluster
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
bear
but
not
what
i
expect
of
an
ipa
where
im
looking
for
more
hops
up
front
an
in
the
flavor
this
is
well
balanced
and
clean
with
a
pilsner
malt
flavor
but
lacks
depth
of
character
from
crystalcaramel
malts
a
decent
lager
beer
but
definitely
not
an
ipa
easy
to
drink
not
as
good
as
on
tapgot
to
try
the
bottled
version
next
d
very
crisp
goes
down
smooth
would
be
refreshing
but
the
sweetness
kinda
ruins
that
i
guess
id
probably
give
this
beer
a
much
higher
rating
if
it
was
listed
as
what
it
probably
is
a
macro
lager
as
an
eipa
though
this
was
total
crap
my
friend
says
that
canadian
beers
often
make
claims
to
being
ipas
rickards
sleemans
keiths
etc
just
because
its
a
beersounding
title
not
because
they
actually
belong
to
said
genre
either
way
this
one
is
a
light
straw
color
with
a
nose
of
malt
and
light
apples
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
lots
of
grainy
malt
nothing
much
else
feel
is
highly
carbonated
but
very
refreshing
ive
thrown
back
a
bunch
of
these
but
certainly
not
in
a
beerdrinkers
frame
of
mind
initial
pour
gives
a
pale
golden
brew
with
a
white
foamy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
much
lighter
in
color
than
i
expected
no
hint
of
hops
in
the
aroma
like
i
expected
taste
is
more
like
a
pilsener
than
an
ipa
very
dry
almost
no
hops
to
speak
of
relatively
nonoffensive
brew
but
not
at
all
what
id
consider
an
ipa
this
is
not
an
ipa
damn
keiths
pours
like
a
macro
should
pour
a
clear
golden
body
with
a
head
that
disappears
quickly
no
hops
on
the
nose
just
a
sweet
malty
like
macro
once
again
no
hops
on
the
palate
well
they
are
there
but
not
like
a
real
ipa
some
malt
and
thats
about
it
i
give
this
beer
such
a
low
score
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
clearly
a
macro
lager
that
decided
to
say
it
was
an
ipa
i
tried
this
beer
on
july
13
2007
at
caseys
bar
and
grill
in
toronto
123
front
st
w
the
beer
was
a
translucent
pale
gold
colour
with
little
or
no
head
aroma
what
aroma
i
seriously
thought
i
was
smelling
water
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
clean
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
the
taste
was
weak
and
thinbodied
i
followed
it
up
with
a
keiths
red
and
that
was
a
mistake
in
and
of
itself
average
nothing
worth
paying
the
extra
premium
price
on
tap
for
those
who
hate
it
hate
it
a
lot
on
tap
in
montreal
pale
yellow
with
thin
white
head
looked
smelled
and
tasted
like
a
macro
lager
this
is
not
an
ipa
in
taste
smell
or
appearance
very
little
hops
in
aroma
or
flavor
and
not
much
malt
either
if
this
were
in
the
american
style
lager
category
id
rate
it
a
little
higher
but
not
much
the
only
consolation
was
that
i
was
able
to
order
a
bottle
of
la
fin
du
monde
to
help
me
forget
the
experience
d
very
easy
to
drink
but
somewhat
uninspiring
poured
out
a
piss
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
light
malt
and
rice
characteristics
in
the
nose
the
taste
offered
nothing
blah
if
i
wanted
coors
light
i
wouldnt
have
left
the
country
why
would
a
brewery
insult
the
good
name
of
an
ipa
by
putting
liquid
crap
into
a
can
and
selling
it
to
me
for
money
jerks
medium
carbonation
medium
body
very
drinkable
like
water
final
statement
definately
not
my
first
run
in
with
the
dreaded
keiths
it
drinks
like
a
cheap
cheap
macro
ale
theres
no
doubt
that
its
better
than
budweiser
or
coors
light
but
this
is
not
an
ipa
or
even
good
ale
and
therefore
gets
terrible
marks
pride
of
nova
scotia
i
think
not
single
bottle
brought
back
from
canada
by
a
friend
for
a
light
lager
its
decent
not
a
very
good
example
of
an
ipa
the
hop
character
isnt
even
close
to
what
it
should
be
its
hard
to
tell
if
they
even
added
hops
not
recommended
i
first
experienced
this
beer
in
a
bar
in
halifax
i
brought
home
a
sixer
to
truly
try
it
while
this
is
labeled
india
pale
ale
it
is
no
where
near
being
an
ipa
the
appearance
is
very
clear

062232222maybe
it
was
because
i
used
to
smoke
like
a
barbecue
or
something
and
you
dont
want
to
resort
to
budweiser
or
any
of
that
garbage
soft
in
the
mouth
and
a
bit
thick
on
the
tongue
drinkable
to
be
sure
smells
like
vinegar
and
overripe
apples
tastes
kind
of
like
some
of
those
really
thin
sweet
malt
liquors
cornlike
and
weirdly
dry
not
a
great
beer
although
some
canuckophiles
disagree
finish
is
skunky
i
think
this
was
better
the
last
time
i
tried
it
maybe
theres
some
variation
between
batches
i
was
on
a
work
related
trip
to
vancouver
when
i
first
tried
this
beer
when
the
waitress
brought
it
to
me
i
didnt
think
it
looked
right
and
after
tasting
it
i
called
her
back
over
i
told
her
that
i
wanted
an
ipa
and
i
didnt
think
that
this
was
one
she
told
me
that
it
was
an
ipa
i
didnt
want
to
argue
about
it
so
i
let
it
go
and
one
of
my
friends
from
canada
told
me
that
it
was
in
fact
alexander
keiths
version
of
an
ipa
this
was
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
wasnt
what
it
claimed
to
be
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
if
i
didnt
want
a
traditional
ipa
it
was
a
good
thirst
quencher
those
who
like
it
like
it
a
lot
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
with
a
very
thin
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
smells
grainy
and
a
little
green
with
hoppiness
and
a
little
honey
as
well
tastes
much
more
like
a
lager
than
an
ipa
with
some
hoppiness
added
to
the
grains
and
light
maltiness
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
nicely
carbonated
would
be
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
and
the
drinkability
is
good
as
the
body
is
light
better
than
your
average
macro
lager
but
the
bar
for
ipas
has
been
set
quite
high
in
north
america
and
since
thats
what
its
labelled
as
i
cant
see
rating
it
too
highly
i
wouldnt
even
have
thought
it
was
an
ipa
because
some
ipas
are
sort
of
bitter
but
this
one
was
very
drinkable
although
its
not
my
preferred
style
of
beer
although
on
this
occasion
i
reviewed
it
from
a
can
so
a
bit
overcarbonated
thus
a
bit
lower
score
for
taste
i
highly
recommend
it
on
tap
sampled
a
bottle
of
this
at
a
house
party
i
would
hardly
call
it
an
ipa
just
a
macro
like
beer
with
a
tiny
bit
of
added
hops
very
bland
and
uninspiring
and
just
lacking
flavor
average
drinkability
its
better
than
an
american
macro
lager
but
this
is
certainly
not
an
ipa
and
cannot
even
be
compared
to
great
examples
of
the
style
ive
heard
many
canadians
brag
about
how
this
beer
is
amazing
they
have
no
idea
what
theyre
talking
about
if
i
was
given
an
icecold
alexander
keiths
on
a
hot
day
id
take
it
gladly
however
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
its
an
ipa
in
name
only
so
if
thats
what
youre
after
look
elsewhere
to
sum
this
beer
in
one
word
meh
nothing
special
though
easy
to
drink
for
a
session
drinkability
very
consumable
beer
very
sessionable
one
of
the
few
beers
that
i
had
more
than
one
of
during
my
trip
however
i
dont
know
if
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
a
little
weak
but
i
think
it
is
intended
to
be
did
i
like
this
beer
yes
but
did
i
like
it
a
lot
no
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
of
these
down
this
needs
a
disclaimer
on
the
label
warning
not
a
real
ipa
i
drank
it
for
what
it
was
worth
and
that
was
a
good
thirst
quenching
beer
and
nothing
more
very
foul
stuff
even
modestly
flavored
beer
after
being
so
beer
deprived
well
what
do
you
really
say
about
this
beer
its
not
a
macro
lager
and
its
not
an
ipa
the
truth
lies
somewhere
in
between
to
be
honest
it
does
fit
the
bill
better
for
an
english
ipa
than
an
american
ipa
but
i
think
its
still
not
quite
there
on
the
other
hand
other
than
appearance
its
not
really
lagerlike
either
compare
it
to
other
labatt
lager
products
blue
kokanee
50
and
youll
find
this
has
much
more
hops
and
ipaish
qualities
i
dunno
its
pretty
good
but
nothing
really
special
i
suppose
atleast
its
a
different
choice
from
macros
if
youre
in
a
bind
and
dont
feel
like
a
macro
lager
maybe
better
on
tap
than
by
the
bottle
its
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
and
its
certainly
not
offensive
so
if
its
between
this
and
the
macro
cheap
stuff
id
take
this
one
any
day
of
the
week
still
not
one
that
id
seek
out
so
i
cant
say
that
ill
be
recommending
it
either
for
the
price
there
are
many
superior
beers
to
pick
up
in
canada
a
lawnmower
or
lesseroftwo
evils
beer
not
terrible
but
not
amazing
pale
yellow
small
budlike
head
that
quickly
disappears
leaving
nothing
behind
fresh
aromatic
corn
hints
of
sulfur
lager
yeast
grassy
and
vegetal
sweet
and
bright
and
incredibly
bland
kind
of
like
fruitsandveggies
seltzer
water
finish
is
rather
smooth
which
tricks
me
into
thinking
hey
this
is
not
that
bad
i
am
going
to
take
another
sip
but
then
that
sip
reminds
me
that
this
is
not
very
good
and
the
fact
that
they
call
this
an
ipa
is
a
joke
unfortunately
the
joke
is
on
whomever
buys
it
the
taste
left
much
to
be
desired
there
were
some
hops
present
but
no
maltiness
to
speak
of
which
left
me
feeling
empty
drinkability
was
average
because
it
didnt
offend
me
beyond
claiming
to
be
an
ipa
drinkability
label
says
those
who
like
it
like
it
a
lot
lots
of
you
dont
but
i
do
it
is
probably
the
best
macro
ale
i
can
easily
buy
here
it
went
down
ok
but
to
be
honest
id
rather
have
a
bud
it
was
very
drinkable
and
had
a
pleasant
enough
feel
on
the
tongue
i
think
it
wuold
be
ebst
served
brutally
cold
on
a
hot
day
though
up
front
a
watered
and
honeyed
herb
wash
coats
the
tongue
and
seems
very
british
the
finish
fades
into
the
lingering
stale
flavors
that
come
from
mass
produced
beer
piss
colored
and
wholly
uninteresting
this
beers
saving
grace
is
its
compatibility
with
most
spicy
citrusy
or
fried
foods
indian
or
mexican
cuisine
is
a
must
with
this
beer
anything
fullflavored
enough
to
overshadow
it
with
a
bias
toward
lime
which
compensates
for
the
beers
hop
deficiency
cheers
this
beer
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
very
little
head
and
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
extremely
subdued
no
hop
aroma
smells
just
like
budweiser
which
is
not
something
i
like
this
is
a
bad
example
of
an
ipa
and
a
bad
example
of
microbrew
didnt
like
it
a
bit
okay
this
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
the
head
is
a
finger
tall
and
falls
to
just
a
ring
over
the
beer
the
beer
smells
like
an
american
macro
i
dont
like
it
at
all
the
flavor
american
macro
some
honey
sweetness
no
hops
in
there
this
beer
sucks
the
feel
is
thin
somewhat
wattery
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
drinkability
suffers
from
all
the
problems
with
this
beer
i
guess
its
a
new
beer
on
my
list
but
at
the
expense
of
taste
and
good
beer
eh
if
you
are
looking
for
a
summer
fest
beer
or
a
clean
lager
this
is
it
if
you
are
looking
for
any
kind
of
ipa
go
somewhere
else
this
is
a
joke
a
very
onedimensional
beer
but
not
undrinkable
either
flavor
was
only
marginally
different
from
a
typical
macro
a
very
thin
metallicandfloral
flavor
over
standard
fizzy
yellow
beer
mouthfeel
was
a
little
more
lively
than
average
nowhere
near
enough
hops
for
the
style
this
was
a
disappointment
i
switched
to
labatt
blue
drafts
after
only
one
and
didnt
feel
like
i
was
losing
much
quality
pours
a
blond
coloured
beer
without
much
head
to
speak
of
aroma
is
probably
too
subtle
for
me
to
notice
anything
beside
cereals
watery
texture
in
mouth
malt
is
present
hops
is
surprisingly
rather
rare
a
good
thirst
rage
brew
but
nothing
tat
stands
out
audacious
indeed
to
label
it
as
ipa
kind
of
overrated
from
my
point
of
view
this
is
bland
quaffable
an
insult
to
ipa
yet
another
hidden
macro
the
taste
is
reminiscent
of
any
massproduced
lager
and
reminds
me
of
many
of
the
ice
style
beers
there
is
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
that
in
so
ways
redeems
it
but
doesnt
make
it
good
i
am
not
a
fan
of
ipas
in
general
but
i
decided
to
give
this
one
a
try
while
i
was
on
vacation
in
toronto
poured
out
to
a
brownish
yellow
colour
with
an
unremarkable
foamy
white
head
that
was
gone
too
soon
typical
ipa
flavor
with
a
little
touch
of
sweetness
and
hints
of
cinnamon
not
what
i
would
call
a
great
beer
but
worth
a
try
and
better
than
most
ipas
when
i
saw
this
canadian
swill
i
found
what
i
thought
to
be
a
diamond
in
the
rough
wow
an
ipa
in
this
land
of
labatt
and
molson
dynasty
i
was
completely
dissapointed
this
brew
pours
a
very
light
gold
with
very
little
head
not
much
to
smell
corn
taste
was
very
underwhelming
very
light
with
very
little
hop
character
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
carbonation
was
high
i
guess
i
could
probobly
pound
a
lot
of
these
but
it
did
not
live
up
to
the
style
of
ipas
that
i
like
it
seemed
not
far
off
from
the
usual
macro
swill
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
does
not
taste
like
a
real
ipa
maybe
they
should
rename
it
halifax
pale
ale
definitely
not
a
traditional
ipa
but
is
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
nonetheless
usually
in
bars
without
much
selection
i
choose
this
as
a
lager
this
is
ok
as
an
ipa
its
an
insult
to
the
name
overall
i
didnt
like
this
ipa
save
your
money
and
pick
up
some
propeller
pale
ale
instead
if
you
want
a
decent
east
coast
canadian
ale
if
not
for
the
other
reviews
here
id
have
thought
the
wrong
beer
had
come
out
of
the
tap
this
ipa
is
a
near
clear
beer
with
some
light
hops
in
the
aroma
taste
is
much
more
like
a
standard
lager
not
sure
where
the
ipa
characteristics
are
or
simply
why
its
being
called
one
on
its
own
its
a
very
refreshing
highly
drinkable
brew
i
ordered
another
ipa
my
ass
though
better
and
fresher
ontap
but
also
had
it
at
granite
brewery
who
are
in
a
partnership
more
color
and
action
through
fizz
to
normal
pale
color
good
with
food
an
unoffensive
beer
and
a
major
step
up
to
your
mates
from
national
brands
more
malt
than
hops
im
having
this
bottle
in
between
pints
of
minneapolis
town
hall
masala
mama
ipa
and
one
of
these
can
be
an
ipa
but
not
both
cause
this
one
dont
cut
it
not
even
an
epa
a
blonde
maybe
this
beer
is
a
very
pale
golden
colour
with
almost
no
head
to
be
found
the
aromas
are
of
light
malts
and
super
light
fruity
hops
this
smells
nothing
like
an
ipa
in
fact
it
is
more
reminiscent
of
a
light
lagerkolsch
hybrid
than
anything
else
the
taste
is
very
light
with
not
much
going
on
in
the
way
of
complexity
but
than
again
what
do
you
expect
there
are
some
slight
hops
in
the
flavor
and
a
very
very
subtle
malt
backbone
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
almost
below
average
and
the
drinkability
is
not
the
best
however
the
look
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
are
all
slightly
better
in
the
draft
version
of
this
brew
than
they
are
in
the
bottled
one
for
a
pale
lager
its
ok
for
an
ipa
this
sucks
big
style
this
is
an
odd
brew
but
not
a
bad
one
from
the
interbrew
family
im
not
convinced
its
an
ipa
but
the
label
says
so
so
well
go
with
that
and
thats
the
only
reason
it
is
however
a
drinkable
pale
ale
if
youre
not
shopping
around
its
kinda
like
airplane
food
back
when
they
had
food
you
know
no
spices
no
onions
no
anything
that
might
offend
too
many
folks
done
right
just
enough
so
that
everybody
could
actually
eat
it
well
we
didnt
really
mind
did
we
if
you
wanted
real
tasty
food
you
could
eat
before
the
flight
or
after
touch
down
if
your
schedule
was
such
that
you
didnt
have
time
to
eat
you
knew
that
at
least
you
would
get
something
on
the
flight
that
was
palatable
well
have
a
keiths
ipa
made
for
the
masses
i
guess
no
hops
no
onions
no
anything
that
might
poured
from
a
brown
341
ml
bottle
from
a
6
pack
is
a
very
light
clear
pale
ale
decent
head
on
the
pour
but
it
fizzles
quickly
a
whole
lot
of
corn
on
the
nose
like
a
roasted
corn
aroma
corn
on
the
flavour
as
well
roasted
corn
uhh
guys
where
are
the
hops
and
wheres
the
malt
for
that
matter
this
is
boldly
advertised
and
passed
off
as
a
traditional
ipa
but
comes
across
more
like
a
molson
pilsner
brewed
on
the
prairies
i
mean
big
rocks
ipa
comes
way
closer
to
an
ipa
although
still
out
of
the
ball
park
than
this
stuff
ever
will
perhaps
they
altered
the
recipe
to
suit
the
region
its
drinkable
enough
though
comparable
to
any
high
quality
macro
on
the
market
although
nothing
very
noteworthy
fantastic
if
you
love
the
taste
of
roasted
corn
and
cant
get
enough
of
it
on
tap
in
old
montreal
served
in
the
alexander
keith
207th
anniversity
mug
presentation
is
great
tastes
nice
and
interesting
of
flavor
chunks
of
hoppy
and
dry
with
a
touch
of
smooth
an
ipa
or
a
pa
i
think
more
to
the
pa
but
a
good
one
of
them
worth
a
pint
to
try
the
brews
feel
carbonated
about
right
easy
on
the
palate
comfortable
to
drink
not
real
special
but
okay
how
the
mighty
have
fallen
pourred
a
yellowish
brew
with
a
nice
head
taste
of
cereal
is
very
present
without
any
distinctive
spice
coming
out
of
this
i
wonder
if
this
is
really
a
ipa
or
just
another
macro
pale
ale
i
would
be
curious
to
taste
to
the
original
brew
before
it
was
bought
by
labatt
this
is
the
absolute
worst
ipa
i
have
ever
tried
within
the
united
states
and
canada
what
right
do
they
have
to
call
this
an
ipa
it
was
the
low
point
of
my
trip
to
toronto
to
experience
their
brews
there
is
no
hint
of
hops
its
also
lacking
any
interesting
taste
and
character
of
the
malt
used
to
brew
this
annoying
beverage
aroma
is
of
slight
hops
and
sweet
smells
there
may
be
corn
syrup
added
to
the
recipie
now
starts
crisp
with
the
hops
adding
a
tart
taste
then
builds
to
a
sweetish
malty
body
and
a
fairly
clean
finish
with
little
after
taste
a
good
draft
beer
for
the
local
tavern
and
quite
drinkable
for
the
average
palate
nothing
to
over
offend
the
taste
buds
here
as
ipas
go
this
is
a
toned
down
version
for
mass
consumption
it
will
do
in
a
pinch
on
a
hot
day
but
it
wont
pacify
beer
snobs
looking
for
london
brewed
ipa
im
back
to
rave
more
about
this
stuff
somehow
even
though
ive
drank
many
bottles
of
this
i
finally
got
to
try
it
on
tap
just
today
its
very
light
in
color
smells
pleasant
and
tastes
great
enough
that
i
could
drink
it
long
enough
to
forget
what
i
was
doing
as
i
almost
have
before
overall
a
decent
beer
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
beer
labeled
india
pale
ale
if
youre
looking
for
a
hoppy
fullflavored
beer
youre
going
to
be
let
down
not
a
bad
beer
a
standard
for
when
choices
are
limited
keiths
poured
a
very
clear
yellow
colour
this
india
pale
ale
is
quite
the
pale
ale
the
head
was
rather
pathetic
that
is
too
say
their
was
no
head
at
all
smelled
alright
pretty
much
malt
and
hops
little
corn
smell
but
the
hops
were
the
most
dominant
tasted
good
too
not
as
hoppy
as
an
ipa
should
be
though
hops
were
tasted
but
it
was
weak
pretty
much
a
malty
brew
with
a
citrus
hop
aftertaste
smooth
mouthfeel
little
overcarbonated
but
smooth
very
drinkable
a
decent
beer
not
a
great
beer
but
decent
a
friend
of
mine
brought
back
a
case
of
alexander
keiths
from
nova
scotia
recently
and
was
kind
enough
to
pass
along
a
6
pack
this
is
labeled
as
an
india
pale
ale
which
might
be
a
bit
of
a
misnomer
as
far
as
ipas
go
but
not
to
say
its
a
bad
beer
keiths
pours
out
very
pale
indeed
almost
a
golden
yellow
with
a
generous
amount
of
light
white
head
smells
more
malty
than
hoppy
almost
smells
like
a
lager
in
my
opinion
taste
is
fairly
light
no
noticeable
hop
bite
but
decent
malty
flavor
with
maybe
a
little
bit
of
acidic
hop
flavor
somewhere
in
the
background
id
call
this
a
good
summer
day
beer
it
went
down
very
easy
no
major
aftertaste
or
bitterness
its
a
little
on
the
weaklight
side
to
be
classed
as
an
ipa
but
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
change
got
give
nova
scotia
some
credit
for
at
least
trying
good
job
eh
keep
at
it
this
is
on
the
right
track
very
clear
and
light
if
you
want
a
hoppy
beer
do
not
try
this
if
you
do
you
will
be
sadly
dissapointed
i
love
ipas
and
tried
this
figuring
it
would
taste
similiar
to
other
aipas
ive
had
wrong
very
little
hopiness
for
its
claim
of
being
an
ipa
aroma
is
light
and
floral
head
is
very
light
and
white
carbonation
is
moderate
and
body
is
light
i
did
not
like
it
much
but
all
in
all
it
is
an
average
beer
not
one
to
like
and
not
one
to
hate
its
better
than
anything
ab
or
the
other
big
two
put
out
i
should
also
add
that
it
is
pretty
drinkable
as
its
taste
is
mild
and
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
balanced
the
taste
is
refreshing
and
sweet
followed
by
a
dry
crispness
typical
of
canadian
beers
the
body
is
also
light
and
refreshing
making
this
a
good
warm
weather
session
beer
this
is
one
ale
that
must
be
consumed
cold
it
adds
a
new
dimension
to
the
beer
tasting
process
lighter
in
body
than
most
canadian
ales
the
colour
as
well
this
india
pale
ale
has
a
very
balanced
taste
leaving
the
consumer
very
satisfied
these
people
at
keiths
really
know
how
to
brew
up
a
good
product
i
would
recomend
this
product
i
call
it
friend
but
its
also
too
pale
too
watery
and
a
touch
too
sweet
its
better
on
tap
that
in
a
bottle
and
better
from
a
bottle
than
in
a
can
and
im
drinking
it
from
a
can
this
was
a
fairly
decent
beer
i
agree
with
some
of
the
other
reviews
that
the
beer
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
it
has
a
nice
crisp
clean
taste
not
much
in
the
line
of
hop
taste
but
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
tried
keiths
ipa
in
a
ice
cold
1
liter
mug
at
a
local
pub
and
under
those
conditions
at
that
time
it
was
the
perfect
beer
ive
never
had
a
beer
cut
through
a
thirst
like
that
before
or
since
nothing
fancy
lightly
flavored
and
inoffensive
but
it
knows
its
job
and
does
it
spectacularly
well
one
of
the
weakest
ipas
ive
ever
had
i
think
of
this
beer
more
in
terms
of
a
light
ale
or
lager
dont
know
how
the
get
away
with
labeling
this
an
ipa
not
bad
as
a
golden
ale
notes
not
sure
how
true
to
the
ipa
style
this
is
but
it
is
a
nice
light
ale
with
an
5
abv
good
hot
day
beer
as
it
is
extremely
refreshing
and
one
could
easily
toss
back
many
of
these
without
getting
bloated
just
got
this
and
west
coast
from
green
flash
to
compare
and
all
in
all
this
is
a
light
version
of
west
coast
still
great
in
scent
and
flavor
but
not
as
powerfull
still
worth
it
though
smooth
ipa
that
according
to
me
is
a
bit
thin
a
little
more
hops
would
have
balanced
the
beer
better
i
love
this
beer
heck
i
love
anything
fullers
good
great
drinkability
feel
is
good
too
beer
is

in

and

the
proper

and
carbonation
i
prefer
heavier
beers
but
at
least
i
admire
the
balance
in
this
one
overall
a
nice

bitterness
is
present
in

overall
a
great
addition
to
the
ipa
scene
by
the
english
brewing
giants
probably
not
a
candidate
for
the
finest
ipa
out
there
but
it
deserves
praise
for
the
balance
of
malt
and
bitterness
that
so
many
breweries
fail
to
achieve
the
brown
color
with
an
orange
twist
has
a
spark
of
flavor
right
from
the
start
the
smell
was
refreshing
and
happily
hoppy
i
had
a
nice
mouthful
of
the
brew
to
refresh
my
lack
of
a
quality
ipa
given
my
location

it

it

from

theres
plenty
of

in

but
not
much
hops
anyone
accustomed
to
drinking
a
west
coast
style
ipa
may
find
this
a
bit
tame
aromawise
however
the
taste
offers
a
some
nice
cerealgrain
flavours
and
there
is
in
fact
quite
a
persistent
hop
bitterness
to
the
finish
just
not
much
aromatics
o
a
fine
example
of
the
english
style
it
is
unique
in
its
fresh
taste
and
feel
without
taking
away
from
the
hoppiness
a
must
try
had
this
on
the
international
day
of
beer
with
indian
food
and
it
paired
great
expectations
come
high
from
me
for
this
brewer
and
after
a
few
minor
hiccups
this
turns
out
aok
no
pandering
to
west
coast
us
influences
just
a
nice
cracking
english
pale
ale
with
a
smidgen
more
hops
and
equally
iterative
booze
factor
all
to
indicate
with
closest
probability
what
those
bengalbound
ships
were
actually
laden
with
lo
those
many
years
ago
if
most
american
ipas
are
like
jimi
hendrix
playing
the
star
spangled
banner
fullers
india
pale
ale
is
like
somebodys
grandmother
sitting
down
to
crumpets
and
tea
to
watch
coronation
street
no
one
can
say
this
is
a
bad
beer
i
dont
think
such
a
thing
can
be
said
about
any
fullers
product
but
its
definitely
unexciting
too
status
quo
for
my
tastes
o
easy
and
highly
drinkable
beer
perfect
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
notes
nothing
really
impressive
just
a
nicely
crafted
ale
nicely
done
but
not
terribly
exciting
for
the
price
here
in
mexico
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
but
a
nice
alternative
to
american
pale
ales
which
are
typically
the
happiest

you
can

ive
drank
such
as

but
not
overly

in

would
be
getting
one
again

not
so
soon

like

mix
this

a

with

backbone
in
the

hints
of
butterscotch
and
caramel
and
the
bitter

really
kick
in
nicely
as
it
warms
for
a
really
well
balanced
english
ipa
extremely
smooth
and
slightly
chewy
with
a
nice
bitter
dry
finish
for
me
this
is
the
definition
of
a
perfect
session
beer
full
flavored
but
not
extreme
had
no
idea
this
was
a
seasonal
brew
im
kicking
myself
for
only
getting
one
of
these
fullers
was
already
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
but
this
beer
totally
surpassed
expectations
have
to
get
more
a
well
done
and
well
balanced
british
ipa
very
complex
and
highly
refreshing
i
cant
help
but
wonder
how
great
this
is
fresh
when
it
doesnt
travel
across
the
pond
the
best
english
ipa
i
can
think
of
it
definitely
is
deserving
of
its
reputation
might
not
be
for
one
dimensional
hopheads
though
forewarned
d
decent
drinkability
though
id
like
to
see
this
a
bit
smoother
d
nice
and
drinkable
with
a
balance
favoring
bitterness
and
musty
english
hops
enough
malt
richness
is
present
to
balance
the
hop
character
and
the
fruity
yeast
helps
to
lend
depth
this
is
a
classic
of
british
beer
and
while
it
is
always
excellent
it
really
does
manage
to
acquire
some
extra
depth
as
a
real
ale
certainly
a
sessionable
ipa
but
i
still
dont
really
get
these
low
abv
british
versions
balanced
and
sessionable
this
is
everything
an
english
cask
should
be

volo

this
is
another
pale

beer
that
doesnt
particularly
appeal
to
me
d
a
very
nice

this
beer
pours
a
pale
amber

which
is
very
lively
carbonated
and
leads
to
a
nice

headit
has
beautiful

in
the
backgroundit
has
a
nice

with
nice
tastes
of

hops
and
malted
barley
is
present
aswell
to
make
it
very
smooth
indeed
with
a
decent
but
pleasant
bitter
aftertaste
which
is
so
easy
to
drink
that
i
will
buy
this
again
good
but
a
little
step
below
the
regular
range
white
shield
is
a
better
english
ipa
drinkability
very
resonant
in
taste
and
smell
even
though
some
of
the
characteristics
switched
priorities
in
the
hegemony
of
sensational
order
milder
than
i
expected
it
to
be
guess
ive
had
me
one
too
many
of
the
yankee
versions
nonetheless
this
is
an
ipa
not
to
be
ignored
its
interesting
and
has
a
prominently
hoppy
tone
winning
not
by
measures
of
strength
but
of
perseverance
too
thin
to
be
an
english
ipa
but
not
punchy
enough
to
be
an
american
ipa
still
easydrinking
though
d
there
are
better
ipas
around
but
this
one
i
had
with
veal
something
i
highly
recomend
in
many
ways
this
beer
should
be
served
at
room
temp
65f
and
in
a
large
pint
glass
surrounded
at
a
wooden
pub
raining
outside
and
red
velvet
seats
inside
a
kidney
pie
with
mash
would
complement
this
brew
hopefully
it
would
not
stop
raining
for
hours
as
you
enjoyed
the
company
and
several
fuller
beers
d
a
refreshing
english
ipa
very
easy
to
drink
but
considering
that
its
an
ipa
its
aromas
and
flavors
are
slightly
too
restrained
i
think
the
hop
character
could
have
been
more
pronounced
although
english
ipas
usually
dont
pack
as
much
hops
as
the
american
ones
do
also
i
think
the
diacetyl
level
is
slightly
too
high
in
this
one
but
still
a
good
beer
i
could
have
complained
about
the
low
bitterness
or
the
rather
low
body
in
this
ipa
but
on
the
other
side
this
is
a
damn
well
crafted
beer
with
a
great
drinkability
poured
a
dark
copper
with
just
a
little
head
which
quickly
faded
smelled
sweet
and
a
bit
hoppy
and
tasted
the
same
maybe
even
a
bit
sweeter
than
the
nose
lightly
carbonated
made
it
real
easy
to
drink
like
all
of
the
fuller
products
a
very
good
beer
recommended
especially
if
you
find
it
on
tap
it
was
a
pale
brown
ale
in
a
pint
glass
that
made
it
to
the
table
with
no
head
or
lacing
to
be
seen
the
aroma
was
of
hops
and
spice
as
i
drank
this
ale
i
was
shocked
to
find
a
bit
of
a
sweet
taste
almost
a
sugar
fore
and
aftertaste
with
a
bite
of
hops
mixed
with
spices
carbonation
was
perfect
to
fit
the
taste
of
a
beer
not
a
taste
i
expected
from
an
ipa
and
it
was
good
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
and
would
definetly
have
this
one
again
md
softly
textured
and
tasty
as
a
fresh
caskconditioned
pale
ale
benefiting
from
rich
hop
characters
a
nice
structure
and
a
superb
slightly
tannic
aftertaste
its
a
truly
decent
and
moreish
little
ipa
was
pleasantly
surprised
overall
an
excellent
example
of
an
ipa
and
yet
another
fine
brew
from
fullers
very
drinkable
recommended
wonder
why
this
beer
rates
as
low
as
it
does
i
think
its
one
of
the
better
english
ipas
out
there
its
malty
caramelly
and
moderately
rich
and
well
meldedmuch
like
the
london
pride
only
with
nice
hop
additions
hops
adds
a
nutty
grassy
woodsy
bitter
characteristics
still
well
devised
and
well
rounded
very
balanced
finish
smooth
creamy
and
full
to
the
palate
not
as
drying
as
i
would
have
thought
could
easily
become
a
session
beer
for
me
slightly
dry
very
drinkable
definitely
worth
a
try
im
giving
it
higher
marks
based
on
the
agebility
of
this
sample
on

at
mccouls

that
falls

into
wispy
nothingness
smell
is
quite
nicesolidly
malty
with
a
musty
floral
decidedly
english
smell
its
not
a
typical
ipa
very
doughy
and
malty
but
also
notably
bitter
i
really
like
the
sweetness
and
the
full
round
malt
character
its
a
welcome
change
from
the
american
style
ipas
full
and
somewhat
soft
mouthfeel
this
brew
is
amazingly
drinkableits
a
solid
treat
very
appealing
lets
just
say
fresher
is
better
with
this
brew
pours
with
an
offwhite
head
about
half
an
inch
deep
and
a
few
lines
of
carbonation
beers
color
is
a
uniformly
very
dirty
copper
yet
almost
transparent
not
much
of
a
change
in
the
highlights
either
smell
is
initially
very
sweet
and
caramelly
or
suggestive
of
sugarfrosted
barley
hulls
a
somewhat
soft
earthyweedy
hop
element
is
also
present
but
very
subtle
im
sure
this
is
well
within
the
expectations
of
an
english
rendition
of
the
style
but
my
americanized
sense
of
smell
just
demands
more
aggression
in
the
hop
department
nosefeel
is
refreshing
but
thin
and
indistinct
thankfully
theres
a
bitterness
in
the
taste
that
emerges
in
midswig
to
offset
a
deep
earthy
sweetness
this
is
actually
quite
nicely
balanced
mouthfeel
is
wet
and
medium
in
body
consistent
from
sip
to
swallow
and
with
a
perfectly
timed
aftertaste
once
youve
had
your
taste
buds
ripped
out
by
an
american
double
ipa
this
will
seem
very
tame
but
this
gets
outstanding
marks
in
drinkability
for
just
that
reason
a
fine
session

not
as
exceptional
as
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
for

lazy

this

its
malty
with
mild
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
malty
flavor
with
a
bitter
dry
finish
the
hops
are
not
that
pronounced
but
the
mild
flavor
is
good
and
balances
well
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
ipa
but
its
done
in
a
fake
english
style
there
is
hardly
any
hops
and
its
dry
i
do
like
the
maltiness
but
the
noble
hops
are
just
too
mild
12
ounce
bottle
best
before
date
of
07june04
still
this
beer
is
an
ipa
in
the
timetested
english
style
and
is
wickedly
sessionable
if
you
are
going
for
a
fullers
pass
this
one
by
and
go
to
one
of
their
finer
brews
especially
the
1845
and
the
vintage
ale
this
is
as
far
from
ruination
as
one
can
get
but
if
one
desires
to
witness
a
modern
template
of
the
style
look
no
further
so
thats
what
an
old
world
ipa
is
like
after
taking
in
a
number
of
west
coast
superipas
this
one
really
caught
me
off
guard
initially
i
didnt
care
for
it
at
first
but
as
i
spent
more
time
with
it
i
grew
to
appreciate
it
and
stopped
comparing
it
to
the
american
ipas
worth
a
try
to
experience
what
british
soldiers
serving
in
the
far
reachs
of
the
empire
had
back
in
the
day
this
is
a
different
ipa
than
im
used
to
but
its
really
the
first
true
english
ipa
that
ive
tried
the
beer
came
in
a
12
ounce
bottle
with
a
best
served
by
date
on
the
back
label
it
pours
a
gold
to
amber
clear
with
an
offwhite
head
with
pale
white
lacing
that
is
longer
lasting
than
us
ipas
the
aroma
is
intriguing
but
im
unable
to
put
my
finger
on
the
aromas
other
than
hops
it
has
other
hints
the
taste
is
of
a
bullbodied
ale
that
is
more
bitter
than
most
pale
ales
there
is
a
definite
flavor
of
caramel
in
amongst
the
hops
and
other
grains
it
feels
great
in
the
mouth
being
more
fullbodied
than
almost
any
pale
ale
ive
had
and
goes
down
real
smooth
i
will
be
adding
this
to
my
drinking
list
and
will
be
trying
other
fullers
this
is
a
good
interperatation
of
the
uk
ipa
style
this
is
a
darker
coloured
beer
with
a
nice
head
the
aromas
are
simple
and
pull
no
punches
they
consist
of
malts
and
hops
in
nice
balance
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aromas
hint
malty
with
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
mix
the
mouthfeel
is
mor
and
the
drinkability
is
great
pale
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
faintly
of
english
nobles
mainly
fuggles
butterscotch
diacetyl
flavor
consistent
with
an
english
ipa
with
a
lingering
hop
quench
good
malt
profile
to
it
too
i
love
2row
highly
drinkable
a
friend
told
me
it
sucked
but
i
bought
a
case
anyways
and
im
glad
i
did
he
likes
american
ipas
but
isnt
an
american
ipa
an
oxymoron
i
dont
remember
the
us
colonizing
india
maybe
other
countries
in
the
vicinity
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
clear
deep
copper
color
with
one
finger
of
head
there
is
a
little
bit
of
lacing
on
this
one
the
smell
is
very
balanced
with
sweet
malts
and
a
bit
of
hops
a
little
floral
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
very
spicy
and
malty
then
ends
with
a
bite
of
hops
its
not
as
hoppy
as
most
american
ipas
but
then
again
this
is
one
of
the
originals
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
strong
and
full
on
the
tongue
the
drinkability
is
very
nice
and
i
could
sip
on
this
ipa
all
night
the
finish
and
aftertaste
of
fullers
are
its
most
unique
characteristics
the
beer
ends
with
a
flash
of
lots
of
different
flavors
through
many
mouthfuls
i
varyingly
detected
the
following
salt
caramel
cinnamon
chocolate
and
maybe
a
little
lemon
all
of
these
flavors
were
gentle
which
probably
explains
why
i
had
so
much
trouble
deciding
what
they
were
this
beer
stays
on
the
tongue
and
the
lips
long
after
its
run
out
but
as
long
as
your
date
likes
ipas
too
that
shouldnt
be
a
problem
appearance
pours
a
caramel
amber
tone
with
a
nice
thicket
of
cream
colored
foamy
head
nice
bands
of
lacing
even
and
decently
full
aroma
buttered
fuggles
here
nice
english
style
ipa
caramel
malts
surround
the
hop
profile
very
nice
taste
flavor
is
the
most
fulfilling
aspect
of
this
beer
so
good
balanced
mix
of
buttery
sweet
fuggles
and
other
english
nobles
mouthfeel
fuller
medium
body
a
great
carbonation
would
love
the
texture
on
cask
i
have
a
feeling
but
such
a
solid
flavor
profile
not
much
beats
this
one
in
way
of
english
ipa
drinkability
if
i
were
traveling
in
london
and
came
upon
this
one
on
a
beer
engine
i
believe
we
would
become
really
close
friends
great
solid
brew
by
a
historic
brewer
awesome
this
is
one
fine
ipa
it
will
not
be
mistaken
for
a
hoppy
american
ipa
the
flavors
are
rich
and
robust
there
is
just
no
extreme
hop
bitterness
like
the
american
versions
enjoy
plenty
of
malt
in
the
front
of
this
one
as
opposed
to
american
ipas
which
are
predominantly
hoppy
subdued
use
of
hops
and
equally
balanced
some
slick
toffee
notes
and
hints
of
burnt
caramel
also
very
nice
and
also
quite
unique
the
drinkability
is
ridiculous
a
perfect
session
brew
recommended
if
you
want
an
english
version
of
a
true
ipa
dont
expect
a
hop
overload
and
you
will
be
pleased
this
beer
pours
an
amber
copper
color
from
its
very
distinctive
18
6
oz
bottle
this
beer
pours
with
a
nice
sized
tan
head
this
beer
smells
of
malts
and
hops
from
the
first
taste
the
hops
are
very
present
but
they
seemed
to
be
balanced
well
this
is
a
british
style
ipa
with
a
slightly
milder
taste
then
most
american
ipas
this
has
a
very
light
mouthfeel
and
is
very
drinkable
while
this
is
not
my
favorite
beer
it
is
not
that
bad
give
it
a
try
overall
is
this
a
real
ipa
i
hear
people
say
who
gives
a
fuck
its
a
damn
good
high
quality
beer
a
little
piece
of
england
in
long
beach
tonight
which
has
left
a
huge
smile
on
this
limey
expat
a
jolly
good
show
and
just
bloody
marvelous
the
feel
was
solid
without
fullness
and
though
creamy
enough
it
had
a
substantial
bite
and
crispness
at
the
finish
this
is
one
really
drinkable
beer
that
only
lacked
a
decent
head
and
lacing
from
the
bottle
the
body
color
is
beautiful
being
dark
amber
with
a
substantial
red
hue
to
heighten
the
look
nice
coppery
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
hops
a
re
present
in
the
smell
with
an
underlying
sweet
malty
that
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
sweet
bakery
smell
nice
and
bitter
with
good
dose
of
hops
a
little
citrusy
in
the
middle
then
sweet
and
a
little
spicey
and
bitter
to
follow
lingering
hop
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
nothing
to
complain
about
a
good
ipa
medium
gold
color
large
head
slightly
malty
aroma
a
mildly
malty
and
not
very
hoppy
ipa
this
is
a
british
style
ipa
so
the
hops
are
very
subdued
tastes
are
mild
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
floral
flavor
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
full
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
frothy
head
disipated
quickly
atop
a
brilliantly
clear
brownish
amber
brew
aroma
is
of
carmelly
malt
balanced
by
a
distinct
english
hop
aroma
and
a
slight
oakiness
taste
is
more
like
an
esb
than
an
ipa
but
it
has
a
flavor
of
a
little
caramel
with
a
lot
of
english
hop
character
and
a
little
saltiness
due
to
water
character
finishes
with
an
average
hop
bitterness
that
makes
it
different
from
the
clean
finish
of
a
good
esb
mouthfeel
is
good
as
this
beer
is
light
on
the
tongue
and
not
very
thick
when
it
goes
down
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
if
it
was
the
best
offering
at
a
bar
that
i
might
find
myself
but
i
would
not
seek
this
one
out
on
its
own
this
beer
pours
a
clear
deep
caramel
with
a
fluffy
white
head
of
large
bubbles
atop
nice
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
and
a
thin
clumpy
head
remains
after
a
few
minutes
nose
is
sweet
caramel
and
full
with
a
bready
aroma
in
the
backend
the
first
sip
is
sweet
with
toasted
toffee
caramel
and
citrus
with
hops
in
the
finish
and
lingering
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
very
light
almost
too
light
the
overall
feel
here
is
balance
with
no
one
aspect
of
taste
or
smell
dominating
another
a
good
beer
and
a
decent
ipa
there
is
something
to
be
said
about
a
beer
that
can
make
a
statement
with
subtlety
in
a
style
where
boldness
is
usually
the
theme
unusual
why
is
it
that
the
esb
is
more
bitter
and
stronger
in
regards
to
abv
and
taste
than
the
ipa
although
this
is
a
real
nice
beer
its
quite
tame
for
the
style
i
dont
know
what
makes
this
an
ipa
tastes
different
than
the
esb
or
london
pride
and
as
an
ale
would
be
a
damn
good
one
doesnt
stand
out
enough
to
merit
a
return
visit
however
considering
the
many
options
in
this
category
nice
pour
nice
smell
nice
taste
no
real
negatives
to
report
but
i
wish
it
had
more
kick
and
bite
to
it
this
beer
poured
an
offwhite
medium
head
with
medium
sized
bubbles
the
hue
of
this
beer
was
amber
and
there
was
good
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
nose
was
that
of
fruit
juice
this
beer
definitely
has
an
aftertaste
to
it
and
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
i
wont
be
seeking
out
any
time
soon
this
brew
has
a
mild
fruity
aroma
when
poured
it
yielded
a
medium
head
of
off
white
medium
to
large
bubbles
that
left
a
good
lacing
as
it
receded
its
body
was
a
medium
amber
color
it
has
a
mild
initial
taste
with
a
slight
after
taste
some
carbonation
was
evident
in
the
taste
this
brew
was
much
smoother
than
i
expected
it
is
a
decent
brew
but
give
me
their
porter
1pt
2
6oz
majestic
bottle
pours
a
burnt
orange
with
a
small
white
head
that
falls
quickly
smokey
malty
aroma
and
very
toasty
medium
bodied
and
carbonated
taste
is
fruity
malts
and
toast
with
hops
presenting
themselves
in
the
finish
along
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
a
little
thin
in
the
finish
kind
of
trails
off
quickly
this
is
a
very
bready
toasty
ale
very
good
for
what
it
is
but
i
prefer
more
hops
and
less
toast
in
my
ipa
watery
mouthfeel
persisted
through
out
in
other
words
the
dry
finish
didnt
pucker
out
my
mouth
wish
more
ipas
would
do
that
much
better
of
a
session
ale
than
almost
any
other
ipa
though
it
did
not
have
the
immense
flavors
of
american
ones
thank
goodness
for
second
bottles
the
first
fullers
i
poured
was
skunked
but
i
didnt
know
it
really
because
id
never
had
it
well
something
rated
this
good
could
not
be
this
bad
so
i
opened
the
second
bottle
much
better
it
pours
a
deep
copper
with
a
lovely
tan
head
beautiful
to
behold
my
first
bottle
had
cascaded
over
the
pint
glass
after
i
had
poured
only
about
4
ounces
back
to
the
real
thing
the
smell
is
nothing
remarkable
but
the
tastemy
god
its
like
buttered
popcorn
im
not
sure
i
like
it
yet
let
me
have
another
go
yes
this
grows
on
you
this
gets
better
and
better
give
it
a
try
taste
began
sweet
light
malt
then
yeast
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
to
the
finish
very
subtle
hops
compared
to
many
ipas
that
are
over
the
top
the
finish
is
very
smooth
dry
with
a
medium
body
that
goes
down
very
easy
and
is
very
refreshing
this
is
a
well
balanced
ipa
of
sweet
malt
and
hops
but
i
am
in
love
with
the
american
way
of
ipa
so
with
this
i
needed
more
hop
in
the
smell
and
taste
but
mind
you
this
is
still
a
good
beer
to
drink
just
tamer
then
most
ipas
that
i
have
a
strong
fondness
for
now
color
is
good
a
nice
pale
golden
yellow
small
offwhite
head
with
some
spotty
lace
smells
of
fresh
sweet
malt
and
grain
with
hop
note
present
very
clean
taste
is
mild
or
paled
if
you
will
of
hops
with
a
perfectly
balanced
caramel
malt
making
for
some
smooth
drinkin
feel
is
solid
medium
body
and
slightly
dry
with
a
very
weakened
bitterness
as
before
this
is
a
good
ipa
but
to
mild
and
light
in
the
hops
for
me
i
would
still
drink
this
any
ol
time
i
think
i
just
have
to
put
out
of
my
head
that
its
an
ipa
just
drink
it
and
be
happy
a
true
classic
ipa
done
the
english
way
hoppy
but
very
well
balanced
with
a
nice
fruity
malt
profile
the
balance
is
perfection
for
an
ipa
i
enjoy
the
huge
hoppy
american
ipas
more
but
its
nice
to
go
back
to
this
every
ipa
lover
should
try
this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
clear
golden
color
very
crisp
looking
slight
white
head
some
lacing
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
its
got
a
nice
sweet
flavor
that
is
bombarded
by
a
nice
dose
of
bitter
hops
similar
in
idea
as
some
of
the
other
english
drinks
that
i
have
had
definately
worth
giving
a
shot
bottom
line
this
wont
dethrone
the
esb
in
my
opinion
but
makes
a
nice
change
of
pace
its
been
almost
a
month
since
my
last
beer
review
so
i
hope
my
taste
buds
are
not
too
out
of
shape
anyway
fullers
ipa
was
not
at
all
what
i
expected
but
i
the
surpirse
was
not
bad
at
all
the
ale
poured
nice
medium
to
dark
yellow
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
bubbles
and
an
overly
fluffy
white
head
the
smell
was
not
at
all
hoppy
instead
it
had
a
clinging
buttery
nose
with
characteristics
of
sugar
and
sweet
fruits
such
as
apple
and
plum
as
opposed
to
citrusy
ones
the
taste
was
finely
balanced
between
hops
and
malts
with
a
little
bit
of
a
wheat
taste
peaking
through
at
times
and
some
notes
of
caramel
and
apple
the
only
complaint
i
had
was
the
mouthfeel
as
it
was
too
carbonated
for
my
liking
overall
a
perfect
session
brew
excellent
hops
spice
in
this
one
the
flavor
is
all
there
too
with
a
nice
medium
body
behind
it
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
overdone
and
it
burns
a
little
bit
otherwise
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
once
the
bubbles
die
down
a
bit
pretty
refreshing
and
wonderful
with
a
spicy
dish
this
is
a
great
drinker
especially
with
a
meal
the
hop
choice
is
definitely
different
from
american
ipas
and
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
me
a
well
done
for
fullers
on
this
one
i
was
holding
out
to
try
this
because
the
price
is
high
11
a
sixer
in
va
normally
i
expect
a
high
abv
and
an
over
the
top
taste
for
that
kind
of
cash
but
i
had
try
this
one
pours
golden
and
slightly
hazy
with
a
nice
frothy
head
the
aroma
and
taste
are
nothing
special
but
good
smell
is
not
too
strong
but
inviting
with
a
characteristic
english
bittersweet
hoppiness
and
nice
caramel
maltiness
the
taste
is
rather
bland
at
first
but
the
bitterness
kicks
in
in
the
aftertaste
leaving
a
nice
zing
on
the
tongue
this
is
not
an
ipa
for
a
hophead
this
ale

kind
of
a
shame
this
bottle
was
past
its
date
nonetheless
just
different
in

the

unlike
what
you
taste
with

is
a

the

come
riding

as
the

hits
the

decent
ipa
had
a
bit
of
an
odd
after
taste
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
drank
it
right
around
the
bestby
date
i
havent
had
it
in
a
few
years
and
i
was
generally
offended
by
almost
any
pale
ale
or
ipa
then
so
i
decided
to
revisit
still
a
drain
pour
first
one
in
a
long
time
but
this
was
just
completely
undrinkable
to
me
seriously
wondering
if
something
was
wrong
with
it
although
i
have
only
had
3
english
ipas
and
the
highest
rating
is
3
5
so
i
may
not
be
judging
to
style
very
well
it
had
a
may
best
by
date
aroma
is
just
awful
it
smells
and
tastes
like
an
old
bad
lager
overly
sweet
like
artificial
sweetner
no
hops
at
all
just
bad
the
only
good
thing
i
can
say
about
it
besides
it
looked
good
is
that
it
is
now
gone
forever
soemthing
had
to
be
wrong
with
this
bottle
or
me

couldnt
make
a

hold

overall
i
might
try

if
i
find

because
this

has
not

do
have
to

this
one
of
the

on

my
favorite
beer
i
can
get
everywhere
bitter
unrefined
flavor
not
in
the
same
league
as
ipas
such
as
centennial
or
sculpin
good
ipa
love
the
commodore
there
is
nothing
even
vaguely
english
about
this
beer
i
dont
know
why
it
has
been
classed
as
an
eipa
it
is
way
too
fruity
and
off
balance
o
this
has
more
of
a
bitter
kick
than
i
expected
there
is
a
pretty
heavy
sweet
presence
in
here
that
is
cut
pretty
heavily
by
the
bitterness
not
the
best
balance
in
here
but
its
tasty
and
refreshing
i
drank
this
beer
my
buddy
brought
it
back
from
cleveland
i
cant
do
a
quick
rating
for
some
reason
so
this
is
why
im
writing
a
dumb
review
overall
id
have
to
guess
this
beer
had
some
flaws
during
bottling
if
it
was
a
homebrew
id
say
acytalaldehyde
only
had
one
other
beer
from
this
brewery
and
it
was
excellent
but
this
one
is
not
right
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
overall
very
good
ipa
o
probably
my
favorite
yearround
beer
by
great
lakes
brewing
company
while
i
do
enjoy
chillwave
double
ipa
and
especially
lake
erie
monster
much
more
ignoring
this
beer
or
not
giving
it
an
excellent
review
makes
no
sense
to
me
i
dont
know
of
too
many
fresh

is

not

pretty

love
it

to

it
leans
towards
an

and
ample

just
short
of
a
dipa
i
would
certainly
drink
again
all
in

another

from

an

very

o
i
really
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
brew
im
truly
impressed
with
this
beer
and
great
lakes
recommended
cheers
truly
enjoyed
this
intensely
hopped
and
mouth
feel
is
crisp
and
good
like
the
hoppy
taste
and
drank
two
over
about
20
minutes
it
was
very
good
each
drink
and
even
tasting
like
the
citrus
bite
i
will
always
drink
this
if
the
place
has
it
draft
or
bottle
a
very
good
ipa
taste
isnt
too
overpowering
and
not
too
much
in
the
way
of
hops
which
can
be
a
refreshing
change
these
days
i
would
strongly
recommend
at
least
trying
this
one
i
am
a
definite
ipa
fan
and
this
beer
does
not
disappoint
a
great
pour
from
the
bottle
or
the
tap
this
beer
offers
a
nice
head
thats
not
too
foamy
with
an
outstanding
aroma
with
forward
citrus
and
a
hint
of
pine
just
the
right
amount
of
malt
flavor
to
enhance
but
not
overpower
the
hops
excellent
beer
by
great
lakes
the
taste
begins
with
a
quick
breaded
malt
character
but
swiftly
turns
into
a
floral
lemony
hop
finish
it
tasted
better
as
it
warmed
very
good
ipa
rjt
ooverall
an
above
average
ipa
i
really
enjoy
the
chillwave
the
most
then
the
erie
monster
second
overall
this
is
a
bit
too
sweet
than
what
i
prefer
in
a
ipa
doesnt
have
that
great
bright
fruitfloral
hop
profile
i
go
for
in
the
style
i
prefer
some
of
gl
other
beers
and
im
likely
to
pass
this
up
for
other
ipas
that
being
said
its
still
quite
tasty
and
enjoyable
especially
for
the
price
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
unusual
for
a
great
lakes
product
this
seems
rather
nondescript
hoppiness
is
noticeable
only
by
the
bitterness
with
no
pronounced
flower
citrus
melon
or
conifer
aroma
or
flavor
perhaps
im
just
used
to
the
more
hopforward
offerings
in
dipas
and
cant
recognize
a
basic
ipa
any
more
for
those
who
dont
want
their
palates
destroyed
by
hop
bombs
this
may
be
a
good
choice
overall
a
really
nice
sessionable
ipa
usual
great
lakes
quality
would
happily
grab
it
again
o
its
hard
to
pin
this
one
down
its
definitely
walking
to
the
beat
of
its
own
drummer
the
flavors
are
common
ipa
flavors
but
they
mix
together
to
form
something
completely
unique
for
that
ill
give
it
an
outstanding
score
for
the
overall
o
average
ipa
definitely
not
in
the
top
tier
but
not
bottom
cellar
unique
taste
but
not
a
memorable
one
good
for
a
try
in
a
pick
six
but
not
much
more
onice
ipa
but
nothing
spectacular
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
beer
and
feel
kind
of
let
down
maybe
im
just
over
ipas
at
this
point
not
all
bad
thoughi
would
definitely
pick
this
over
many
of
ipas
overall
good
beer
another
one
that
i
bought
as
a
single
to
try
out
and
definitely
not
dissipointed
perhaps
the
musty
grain
malt
flavor
was
an
aberration
and
not
all
bottles
hold
this
same
property
but
it
detracted
from
the
overall
taste
fantastic
flagship
type
beer
for
northeast
ohio
some
local
seasonal
beers
will
top
it
in
my
opinion
however
for
year
round
availability
it
stands
on
its
own
as
a
go
to
beer
its
not
overpowering
but
has
great
flavor
that
hides
the
fact
it
clocks
in
at
7
5
abv
overall
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
glbc
to
date
if
your
new
to
ipas
i
would
recommend
burning
river
first
then
knock
on
commodore
perry
door
and
say
dont
give
up
a
sip
o
a
wonderful
rendition
on
an
ipa
and
my
favorite
brew
from
great
lakes
brewing
im
glad
i
came
across
this
one
and
will
seek
it
out
in
the
future

this
is
the
first
great

brewery
beer
ive
drank
and
i
could
see
myself
going
back
to
this
and
definitely
trying
other
great
lakes
brews
i
enjoyed
every
bit
of
this
ive
had
3
of
these
so
far
and
im
really
looking
forward
to
the
other
3
i
have
have
one
cheers
why
did
i
buy
only
one
bottle
to
test
it
out
but
i
could
easily
down
a
sixpack
in
a
few
sittings
no
sign
whatsoever
of
strength
here
when
it
came
to
the
abv
and
that
was
as
testament
to
how
easily
enjoyable
this
was
while
not
as
intense
or
full
as
other
ipas
or
english
ipas
theres
so
much
to
like
here
including
the
easygoing
nature
of
this
perfect
for
someone
new
to
the
style
or
willing
to
kick
a
few
back
without
downing
a
hop
bomb
im
sure
ive
had
this
beer
before
but
i
dont
remember
anything
about
it
so
this
was
like
a
brand
new
experience
not
sure
why
my
expectations
were
relatively
low
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
much
i
liked
it
not
complex
or
groundbreaking
but
very
solid
and
refreshing
id
put
it
a
notch
ahead
of
ipas
like
southern
tier
or
hop
devil
but
not
quite
on
the
level
of
troegs
perpetual

fat

just
go
get
it
overall

but
not
something
ill
seek
out

an

excellent

from

that
is
amazingly
well

i
will
make
an

to
get
again
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
glass
among
my
favorite
ipas
yes
i
am
quite
biased
in
favor
of
great
lakes
brewing
company
because
one
of
my
best
friends
worked
there
for
nine
years
and
ive
spent
many
a
fine
afternoonevening
at
the
place
but
my
preference
for
glbc
beer
is
primarily
because
the
beers
are
almost
always
outstanding
cheers
overall
its
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
think
it
would
be
quite
nearly
dead
on
if
it
was
casked
really
malt
heavy
bitter
hops
used
pours
a
clean
crisp
gold
hues
very
clear
it
is
crisp
dry
fiunish
with
rich
bitter
hops
taste
theere
is
little
to
no
head
it
is
somewhat
rich
and
thick
but
not
overwhelmingly
overall
a
great
ipa
but
not
my
style
im
more
into
the
fruity
ipa
great
bitter
hoppy
taste
with
dry
finish
rich
malty
overtones
great
englsh
ipa
simple
ipa
in
that
there
is
no
heavy
backbone
but
so
well
crafted
smooth
with
a
perfect
orchestration
of
flavors
another
well
done
brew
from
gl
taste
starts
out
slightly
sweet
with
caramel
notes
slight
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
light
to
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
a
nice
change
from
american
ipas
great
tasting
ipa
i
believe
i
will
look
for
this
beer
again
excellent
citrus
aroma
and
strong
hops
flavor
not
surprised
though
it
was
the
last
of
its
stock
on
shelf
the
hops
flavor
was
near
perfect
bitterthat
i
enjoy
but
also
just
sweet
enough
to
compliment
a
great
steak
a
smooth
tasting
and
overall
good
ipa
that
goes
down
well
it
does
not
carry
too
much
bite
as
an
ipa
and
i
would
bet
that
it
would
be
an
awesome
beer
to
go
with
a
steak
or
ribs
this
is
easily
my
favorite
of
the
beers
from
the
great
lakes
brewing
company
give
it
a
try
peace
poured
into
the
glass
with
a
nice
head
smell
had
citrus
notes
but
caramel
malt
prevailed
especially
for
an
ipa
taste
was
malty
with
a
significant
bittering
hop
profile
mouth
feel
was
outstanding
for
me
a
substantial
beer
7
5
abv
in
alcohol
content
and
flavor
that
establishes
this
beer
as
a
stand
alone
more
than
a
session
great
lakes
does
it
again
overall
a
little
citrusy
for
an
english
ipa
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
good
amount
of
caramel
and
bready
grains
as
it
warms
o
simply
a
delicious
beer
bordering
on
a
tasty
dipa
im
impressed
at
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
as
no
alcohol
is
detected
lots
of
hop
flavors
to
pick
out
too
taste
i
found
to
be
quite
balanced
and
enjoyable
a
slightly
above
average
dose
of
citrus
hops
with
some
citrus
peel
finish
and
a
hint
of
malt
a
rather
full
mouth
feel
for
an
english
style
overall
i
found
this
beer
quite
a
pleasure
to
drink
overall
this
is
another
good
beer
from
great
lakes
its
up
my
ally
for
ipas
to
where
its
one
of
my
favorites
of
this
style
in
a
paragraph
above
i
mention
about
this
beer
leaving
me
with
a
sense
of
accomplishment
well
it
did
but
now
i
want
to
accomplish
something
else
so
im
going
to
get
another
one
this
is
a
second
rating
great
lakes
has
reputation
in
my
house
for
making
exciting
and
exceptional
beers
and
this
one
lived
up
to
my
expectations
it
approached
outstanding
but
the
alcohol
was
too
prominent
on
the
palate
for
its
abv
the
nose
on
this
bottle
was
sweet
and
juicy
fragrant
and
fresh
my
first
rating
was
on
628
and
the
total
score
3
38
if
great
lakes
was
not
such
a
favorite
of
mine
i
would
never
have
sought
out
the
additional
bottles
to
compare
so
glad
i
did
classic
ipa
taste
without
being
heavy
despite
its
7
5
abv
excellent
balance
of
hop
bite
and
smoothness
nothing
showy
just
really
well
made
ale
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
dont
want
to
stop
drinking
it
this
can
be
not
a
good
thing
love
this
ale
nothing
special
at
all
o
a
great
ipa
not
perfect
but
worth
revisting
every
now
and
again
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
if
you
didnt
tell
me
i
would
think
this
was
a
double
ipa
i
guess
at
7
5
it
maybe
could
push
towards
that
but
the
maltiness
i
guess
confuses
me
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
for
the
style
its
hugely
hoppy
but
theres
also
a
great
malty
breadiness
about
it
i
really
love
this
beer
for
doing
what
it
does
despite
being
2
abv
under
other
double
ipas
i
can
compare
it
to
like
their
alchemy
hour
overall
will
rereview
when
i
get
a
chance
bottled
122412
way
too
old
for
an
ipa
or
any
beer
really
but
i
decided
to
drink
it
anyways
wasnt
going
to
review
it
but
it
was
still
decently
hoppy
and
enjoyable
so
i
went
ahead
ive
never
had
a
bad
beer
from
great
lakes
even
though
theyre
from
ohio
and
this
was
still
a
great
ipa
after
6
months
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
a
fresh
one
o
pretty
standard
eipa
mellow
but
notable
hoppiness
easy
drinking
although
a
bit
dry
hoppiness
isnt
overpowering
but
theres
barely
any
malt
to
back
it
up
not
bad
although
i
prefer
and
aipa
over
and
eipa
any
day
this
eipa
trumps
a
great
many
aipas
that
ive
had
the
grapefruit
is
there
but
its
not
intense
for
this
brew
thats
a
good
thing
this
has
just
the
right
about
the
bitterness
and
you
can
definitely
taste
the
alcoholic
content
more
so
in
the
aftertaste
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
this
is
what
i
want
from
an
english
ipa
o
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
and
would
certainly
not
hesitate
to
make
this
a
daily
beer
great
flavors
and
structure
complex
enough
to
be
interesting
all
the
way
through
the
glass
o
i
suspect
this
beer
is
amazing
when
fresh
for
what
i
was
able
to
get
my
hands
on
i
am
glad
to
have
five
more
m
light
medium
bodied
appearance
is
a
orangestraw
color
with
two
fingers
of
fluffy
head
the
nose
is
distinctly
hoppy
but
also
spicy
as
if
there
might
be
some
rye
in
this
offering
the
taste
and
finish
match
the
nose
perfectly
bitter
and
spicy
this
is
a
very
good
ipa
that
does
not
easily
fit
in
the
east
coast
west
coast
definitions
of
ipas
this
beer
is
pretty
unremarkable
and
a
bit
faded
o
this
was
an
ok
brew
i
tried
it
because
my
local
liquor
store
just
received
a
couple
great
lakes
brews
so
i
figured
why
not
a
very
normal
ipa
o
a
decent
beer
but
not
worth
including
into
steady
diet
o
pretty
decent
but
nothing
really
outstanding
about
it
i
would
drink
it
again
but
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
o
overall
would
like
to
try
it
fresher
but
not
a
bad
english
ipa
at
expiration
date
malthy
some
citric
sweetness
nice
toasted
caramel
o
excellent
representation
of
the
style
tasty
i
could
session
this
all
day
o
not
bad
pedestrian
unoffensive
and
on
the
weak
side
of
the
style
great
lakes
is
just
a
solid
brewery
period
commodore
perry
is
proof
that
they
know
how
to
stick
to
a
tried
and
true
formula
for
a
traditional
style
while
still
putting
a
nice
twist
on
it
to
stick
out
from
the
pack
while
not
a
mindblowing
earthshattering
ipa
id
rather
have
commodore
perry
which
can
absolutely
hold
its
own
with
such
a
great
sense
of
balance
a
nice
sharp
floralherb
bite
up
front
followed
by
biscuit
malt
notes
ends
crisp
and
dry
with
lemon
this
is
an
easy
drinking
ipa
it
has
some
big
flavor
but
it
sneaks
up
subtly
and
is
well
balanced
the
alcohol
presence
is
a
little
sharp
otherwise
it
is
very
good
overall
falls
in
the
pale
ale
category
near
dales
pa
but
not
quite
as
awesome
o
nothing
spectacular
not
bad
just
not
good
ill
search
for
something
else
next
time
overall
this
is
the
first
ipa
that
i
have
truly
enjoyed
every
sip
of
i
love
the
bread
flavors
that
come
through
and
the
fruity
beginning
definitely
a
must
try
for
the
quality
and
price
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
ipa
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
its
visually
appealing
and
pours
a
medium
gold
with
a
thin
head
that
slowly
trickles
down
the
lengths
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
loaded
with
sweet
malt
a
little
bread
and
subtle
hops
not
its
best
quality
but
not
unappealing
by
any
stretch
the
commodore
is
sticky
sweet
and
nicely
balanced
with
ample
piney
bitter
hops
a
little
too
much
carbonation
distracts
from
the
thick
chewy
texture
for
being
well
past
its
suggested
prime
it
surprisingly
wasnt
bad
at
all
just
not
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
and
to
be
fair
not
what
the
beer
is
really
meant
to
be
despite
that
the
quality
of
the
beer
a
year
and
a
half
past
due
is
such
that
id
be
excited
to
try
this
one
fresh
i
will
make
sure
i
seek
this
one
out
when
its
back
in
season
and
my
review
will
be
subject
to
change
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
becker
slightly
cloudy
light
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
flattens
quickly
but
then
sticks
around
thin
but
sticky
lacing
smell
is
malts
and
relatively
calm
hops
so
far
just
as
would
be
expected
from
the
tamer
breed
of
ipas
taste
defies
nose
with
a
good
deal
of
hops
finishing
crisp
and
clean
with
lingering
bitterness
that
keeps
you
coming
back
for
the
next
sip
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
fizzy
and
full
an
excellent
english
ipa
overall
a
solid
brew
from
great
lakes
no
surprise
there
decent
hop
flavors
with
a
solid
malt
foundation
very
drinkable
with
a
smooth
mouth
presence
i
definitely
want
to
find
it
fresh
whats
with
all
the
apple
flavors
this
really
isnt
what
i
look
for
in
an
english
ipa
it
tastes
strange
but
is
still
rather
easy
drinking
o
delicious
ipa
good
hop
and
malt
blend
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
finger
or
so
of
head
at
the
start
thin
film
of
head
left
on
top
of
the
beer
through
most
of
consumption
with
a
small
amount
of
lacing
present
smell
is
hoppy
piney
yet
fruity
taste
reveals
more
of
a
sweet
and
fruity
hop
flavor
nicely
balanced
and
for
a
strong
ipa
it
is
not
too
bold
for
those
that
are
less
into
ipas
overall
a
very
solid
above
average
ipa
this
beer
could
only
be
better
ontap
or
fresher
so
id
love
to
have
it
again
some
time
not
actually
a
big
fan
of
this
maybe
the
salty
taste
im
picking
up
is
an
anomaly
ill
come
back
to
this
again
in
the
future
to
see
o
i
like
this
beer
i
need
to
start
reviewing
beers
i
dont
love
it
doesnt
hurt
that
i
grew
up
literally
across
the
street
from
the
brewery
in
cleveland
do
this
classic
ipa
shows
some
elegant
qualities
indicative
of
fine
attention
to
detail
on
the
part
of
the
brewer
like
some
other
aging
recipes
such
as
bridgeport
ipa
or
stone
ipa
this
one
is
still
able
to
bring
it
perhaps
in
its
ability
to
appeal
to
ones
sense
of
nostalgia
overall
certainly
a
great
ipa
would
love
for
this
to
be
in
the
mix
pack
any
hophead
should
give
it
a
go
o
meh
not
bad
but
there
are
way
better
beers
available
to
me
in
chicago
imo
what
a
beer
this
is
the
best
work
of
great
lakes
i
think
the
pour
is
orange
and
clear
caramely
and
lucrative
lacey
white
head
dank
nose
lots
of
fruity
hops
and
some
odd
dried
fruit
aroma
as
well
maybe
cherries
or
something
more
exotic
some
english
malt
in
there
somewhere
too
but
this
is
a
hop
bomb
bordering
on
a
fresh
hop
brew
with
high
alpha
and
resin
content
the
flavor
is
consistent
with
the
smell
where
is
all
this
fruit
coming
from
and
how
the
hell
is
this
beer
pushing
8
abv
its
so
delicate
and
nuances
it
cant
be
that
strong
can
it
almost
acidicly
bitter
in
the
finish
but
there
again
is
that
semisweet
dries
fruit
complex
that
keeps
lingering
enough
carbonation
and
only
a
medium
body
i
could
drink
this
until
the
saturation
point
without
much
trouble
i
think
easliy
the
best
great
lakes
offering
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tipping
back
a
real
treat
and
something
different
finally
in
the
american
ipa
world
no
head
really
on
a
cloudy
amber
orange
body
aroma
of
nondescript
citrus
and
earthy
hops
with
toasted
malts
this
one
is
really
piney
and
grassy
and
some
very
tart
orange
it
takes
some
time
to
get
used
to
also
has
a
toasted
malt
base
floral
notes
as
well
moderate
to
high
carbonation
and
medium
body
i
like
this
beer
its
just
hard
to
drink
for
the
first
few
sips
the
pine
is
resilient
though
and
you
never
get
completely
used
to
it
i
also
feel
its
a
little
over
carbonated
pours
copper
with
a
small
off
white
head
aroma
is
wonderful
sweet
and
fruity
tangerines
grapefruit
and
melon
nice
flavor
to
match
starts
out
sweet
with
some
malts
and
the
fruit
followed
by
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
finish
great
balance
of
flavors
and
it
has
a
nice
tart
yet
subtly
sweet
aftertaste
leaves
a
nice
lacing
after
every
drink
excellent
unique
take
on
an
ipa
overall
a
very
nice
english
ipa
which
hides
its
abv
very
well
pours
a
clear
amber
with
honey
gold
highlights
the
two
finger
cream
color
head
has
great
retention
and
leaves
behind
a
good
amount
of
sticky
splotchy
lacing
grassy
herbal
and
a
hint
of
citrus
blossoms
on
the
notes
opens
with
mild
bitterness
bready
with
toasty
caramel
accents
embedded
in
the
very
noticeable
malt
bill
that
slowly
gives
way
to
a
dry
crisp
finish
dominated
by
grapefruit
rind
bitterness
and
hints
of
alcohol
medium
bodied
smooth
and
wellcarbonated
very
enjoyable
and
extremely
well
balanced
as
a
fan
of
english
ipas
although
this
tends
to
be
a
bit
more
bitter
than
most
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
readily
available
in
my
area
crystal
clear
straw
colored
body
with
two
fingers
worth
of
white
creamy
head
and
ample
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malts
a
little
herbal
like
mint
and
lemon
verbena
taste
is
pretty
simple
nothing
complicated
or
too
overpowering
just
a
nicely
blended
ipa
with
enough
malt
backbone
to
balance
the
hops
mouthfeel
has
good
carbonation
but
the
body
seems
a
little
watery
for
me
not
overly
bitter
or
dry
on
the
finish
overall
i
like
it
and
its
easy
drinkin
but
just
dont
know
if
this
will
be
a
staple
in
the
fridge
i
really
wish
great
lakes
came
to
maryland
but
alas
o
i
cant
believe
its
taken
me
so
long
to
get
around
and
try
this
brew
absolutely
outstanding
o
at
first
i
was
expecting
something
more
like
an
english
pale
ale
but
this
is
definitely
an
english
ipa
a
solid
beer
o
there
is
honestly
nothing
that
stands
out
about
this
beer
in
terms
of
flavor
other
than
the
fact
that
it
is
a
remarkably
well
balanced
ipa
the
taste
is
an
excellent
blend
of
malts
and
hops
and
im
not
one
to
complain
about
7
5
abv
definitely
a
solid
delivery
bring
on
the
rest
of
the
ipas
by
great
lakes
o
a
very
nice
ipa
that
breaks
the
boundries
of
westeast
coast
or
straight
up
english
ipa
me
likey
overall
a
wonderfully
tasty
ipa
very
smooth
flavor
transitions
and
a
great
flavor
profile
one
to
go
to
again
and
again
at
long
last
i
finally
get
to
try
something
from
great
lakes
brewing
company
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
the
brightest
copper
i
have
ever
seen
with
a
two
and
a
half
finger
white
head
leaves
a
great
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
exceptional
hops
along
with
distant
pine
oranges
and
grapefruit
pineapple
also
comes
through
if
inhaled
hard
enough
basically
smells
like
a
very
sweet
fruit
basket
the
taste
is
predominantly
pine
with
a
decent
amount
of
banana
coming
through
slight
orange
some
odd
wheat
and
also
some
odd
soapyness
come
through
as
well
the
motuhfeel
is
of
strong
pine
with
a
bit
of
lemon
zest
and
ever
so
slight
orange
with
a
moderate
amount
of
wheat
overall
this
is
a
great
ipa
with
lots
of
flavor
although
the
odd
soapyness
kind
of
ruins
the
whole
deal
for
me
would
i
buy
it
again
yes
although
it
cannot
hold
a
candle
to
mad
hatter
o
overall
this
wasnt
a
bad
english
ipa
always
like
trying
beers
from
great
lakes
brewing
company
o
an
easy
drinking
ipa
with
good
flavor
a
solid
staple
beer
overall
a
very
satisfying
beer
with
a
very
effective
balance
of
hops
and
malt
a
repeat
buy
without
a
doubt
on
tap
the
commodore
is
even
better
the
head
seems
creamier
and
lasts
forever
in
its
fine
lacey
perfection
one
of
the
outdoor
festivals
i
attend
each
year
has
had
this
along
with
a
number
of
other
goodies
on
their
beer
trucks
ill
keep
coming
back
for
the
music
and
the
quality
draft
beer
this
is
one
to
get
if
you
can
o
not
very
wellbalanced
as
the
taste
gets
overrun
with
this
weird
cornlike
quality
i
am
not
sure
where
these
notes
are
coming
from
the
hops
are
there
but
it
is
also
sweet
so
it
would
be
a
stretch
to
call
it
an
ipa
i
would
much
rather
have
their
lake
erie
monster
dipa
it
is
a
more
bold
yet
traditional
beer
this
is
not
the
delicious
experience
i
have
come
to
expect
from
great
lakes
brewing
it
may
be
an
issue
of
freshness
but
on
the
bottle
it
says
to
enjoy
by
8142012
would
never
known
it
was
7
5
abv
a
great
drinking
and
tasting
english
style
ipa
here
very
good
stuff
another
winner
from
great
lakes
a
this
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
slight
off
white
head
that
lasts
all
the
way
down
the
aroma
is
all
hops
a
lot
of
citrus
and
astringency
the
taste
is
bitter
and
all
about
the
hops
there
is
a
ton
of
citrus
skunkyness
and
astringent
notes
the
malts
dont
really
come
through
in
flavor
but
do
come
in
nicely
to
the
feel
part
of
the
beer
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
there
and
is
quite
bitter
a
drinkable
beer
for
its
size
a
pretty
decent
ipa
this
is
a
little
brother
to
the
lake
erie
monster
d
a
bit
like
a
winter
seasonal
beer
with
spices
and
malt
but
with
refreshing
and
diverse
fruit
qualities
tasty
and
fairly
complex
medium
golden
pour
huge
offwhite
head
quickly
dying
down
with
good
lacing
smell
of
earthy
hops
grapefruit
and
somewhat
sweet
perhaps
brown
sugar
or
something
similar
taste
is
very
bitter
compared
to
the
nose
hops
are
somewhat
unique
in
their
funkiness
with
an
herbal
taste
that
fades
quickly
into
a
clean
citrus
mouthfeel
is
average
for
an
ipa
though
not
as
balanced
as
id
like
a
solid
brew
but
my
least
favorite
great
lakes
ive
had
yet
theres
just
too
many
competitors
in
the
region
that
have
a
better
balance
and
depth
for
me
to
recommend
this
as
an
ipa
over
others
readily
available
o
very
dynamic
better
and
very
bitter
for
an
english
ipa
really
dig
the
herbal
and
earthy
tones
overall
a
decent
enough
beer
but
its
flavors
are
muddled
and
not
ideal
overall
a
tasty
ipa
but
a
little
less
malty
than
i
was
hoping
for
from
an
english
ipa
still
the
malt
that
is
there
fits
well
and
all
in
all
i
would
have
this
again
pours
a
bright
golden
color
extremely
heavy
on
the
malts
though
the
aftertaste
resembles
citrus
wrapped
in
a
tootsie
roll
nicely
balanced
tastes
better
than
it
smells
but
thats
often
the
case
for
english
ipas
like
this
a
recommended
purchase
though
great
lakes
has
produced
better
this
was
a
better
beer
than
i
expected
overall
good
drinking
beer
better
than
most
for
style
and
a
new
favorite
from
this
brewery
o
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
really
got
me
into
craft
beer
and
i
still
love
it
i
cant
believe
i
have
never
reviewed
it
over
all
this
is
one
of
finest
ipas
in
america
i
would
buy
this
ale
again
and
again
cream
of
the
crop
a
fine
enough
ipa
that
is
malty
and
hoppy
with
notes
of
spice
and
stone
fruit
but
too
boozy
for
its
own
good
o
a
tasty
beer
a
bit
maltier
and
less
citrusy
than
i
usually
like
ipas
but
tasty
nonetheless
o
surprised
ive
never
tried
this
before
i
am
more
of
a
west
coast
american
ipa
but
this
was
enjoyable
semihazed
orangeish
amber
in
color
just
like
most
other
ipas
on
the
market
a
slim
ring
of
foam
for
a
head
some
minor
lacing
left
behind
aroma
and
flavor
both
contained
an
very
high
amount
of
orange
and
grapefruit
peel
to
pine
resin
ratio
over
the
top
of
a
balancing
toffee
malt
hits
the
sweetbitter
balance
and
really
close
to
the
smoother
texture
medium
carbonation
i
prefer
in
my
ipas
mainly
this
one
is
memorable
for
the
citrus
peel
focus
over
other
kinds
of
hopping
a
greatsmelling
and
decenttasting
english
ipa
but
seriously
missing
that
slingoneback
drinkability
that
usually
forgives
any
sins
flaws
to
the
brew
still
recommended
perhaps
falling
short
because
i
had
a
sip
of
a
tasty
penn
cheeky
yinzer
earlier
this
evening
3
5
overall
what
we
found
to
be
most
enjoyable
about
this
brew
was
the
blend
through
the
nose
and
the
follow
through
in
the
taste
this
beer
had
the
perfect
amount
of
syrupy
sweetness
to
complement
the
lightly
toasted
malts
the
fruitiness
and
fresh
hop
qualities
put
this
one
over
the
top
with
every
category
being
stylistically
sweet
even
and
robust
o
gotta
be
honest
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
and
it
kind
of
blew
me
away
great
lakes
only
recently
came
to
nova
and
i
had
heard
a
lot
of
good
things
about
the
brewery
and
it
delivers
here
great
beer
so
tasty
so
drinkable
o
when
i
took
my
1st
few
sips
i
thought
it
was
a
very
citrus
forward
ipa
but
then
as
i
worked
my
way
through
it
i
noticed
it
has
a
huge
bitter
aftertaste
o
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
great
when
consumed
directly
out
of
the
fridge
i
enjoyed
the
balance
and
the
hop
content
that
was
complemented
by
the
fruits
but
as
it
warmed
within
1215
minutes
the
balanced
was
thrown
out
of
balance
and
the
fruit
notes
really
begin
to
subside
making
this
beer
less
desirable
pours
a
clear
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
zest
and
some
spicy
and
peppery
hop
aromas
taste
is
the
same
with
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
ipa
but
i
like
the
way
it
smells
more
than
the
taste
oeasy
drinking
ipa
though
not
worth
it
if
others
are
available
worth
a
try
though
o
very
enjoyable
and
a
nice
beer
but
probably
too
hoppybitter
to
be
a
sessionable
beer
in
my
opinion
the
citrus
hops
are
really
highlighted
in
this
offering
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
drinking
and
has
lots
of
citrusy
flavors
without
being
too
bitter
o
solid
offering
there
are
lots
of
very
good
ipas
out
there
this
is
one
of
them
its
clear
bitter
and
features
some
juicy
fruit
my
first
english
ipa
and
it
does
have
a
different
feel
and
taste
than
the
american
ipas
that
i
have
been
tasting
i
am
enjoying
the
multifaceted
taste
as
the
other
flavors
of
the
brew
pull
the
hops
into
a
nice
balance
well
done
o
this
is
a
very
good
and
enjoyable
ipa
it
doesnt
overwhelm
but
it
doesnt
try
to
recommended
if
you
want
a
basic
ipa
to
enjoy
and
have
a
few
of
after
trying
some
of
their
other
offerings
i
can
say
that
im
very
happy
to
have
great
lakes
in
virginia
now
its
not
a
modest
abv
at
7
5
but
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
night
in
fact
i
might
just
do
that
clear
golden
color
with
a
tight
creamy
looking
white
head
on
top
pulpy
citrus
and
melon
hop
aroma
dried
fruit
herbs
and
wood
as
well
over
a
hint
of
cereal
grain
sweet
grapefruit
and
pine
flavor
from
the
us
hops
contrasted
by
the
leafier
somewhat
vegetal
fuggles
im
not
sure
its
a
combination
i
would
have
used
but
it
ends
up
pretty
tasty
all
the
same
slick
oily
zesty
and
bitter
it
is
undoubtedly
an
ipa
but
i
suppose
somewhere
in
the
grey
area
between
american
and
english
pretty
good
though
it
just
doesnt
wow
me
in
any
way
pours
a
peachy
gold
with
a
fat
fluffy
white
head
and
tons
of
needlepoint
beading
smells
nice
bits
of
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
backed
by
slightly
nutty
bready
malts
on
the
tongue
its
less
aggressive
than
many
others
of
its
genre
without
knowing
id
probably
label
this
one
an
american
pale
its
satisfying
nevertheless
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
o
one
of
the
few
beers
from
gl
that
i
am
not
impressed
with
tastes
more
like
a
hefewiezen
than
an
ipa
to
me
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
pretty
disapointed
as
a
matter
of
fact
pours
a
deep
burnt
amber
color
with
good
clarity
head
is
only
moderate
even
with
a
vigorous
pour
and
disappates
in
short
order
the
aroma
is
fantasticfruity
clean
and
just
enough
pine
to
grab
your
attention
without
overpowering
the
gentler
scents
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
what
you
would
expect
from
a
solid
ipabitter
fairly
piney
without
a
whole
lot
else
going
on
pretty
good
as
far
as
ipas
go
but
they
arent
a
style
i
typically
enjoy
so
i
cant
give
the
taste
a
ringing
endorsement
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
overall
a
nice
yet
unremarkable
representative
of
its
style
o
good
not
my
favorite
but
a
solid
consistent
ipa
this
is
a
nice
ipa
i
like
the
big
malty
backbone
the
hops
are
solid
and
are
a
nice
match
to
the
malts
this
is
well
balanced
smooth
and
very
drinkable
i
love
great
lakes
and
i
also
love
ipas
so
i
found
this
beer
to
be
amazing
this
brew
has
a
nice
straw
color
and
nice
two
finger
head
that
laces
nicely
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
there
are
some
light
citrus
notes
present
on
the
nose
the
taste
has
a
nice
and
light
hop
spiciness
that
fits
the
alcohol
content
very
well
i
buy
this
brew
all
the
time
and
would
recommend
this
one
to
anybody
very
drinkable
for
an
ipa
and
extremely
balanced
between
the
hops
and
bitterness
another
great
brew
from
the
geniuses
at
great
lakes
o
another
nice
offering
from
great
lakes
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
english
ipa
i
would
gladly
recommend
167th
this
one
looks
very
inviting
when
poured
into
a
glass
it
has
a
nice
goldne
color
body
with
a
nice
1finger
of
creamy
white
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
the
smell
is
of
piney
with
some
citrus
coming
through
the
taste
is
bitter
of
hops
but
the
malt
come
in
to
give
it
a
nice
balance
also
i
get
some
citrus
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouth
feel
is
great
and
overall
this
is
a
excellent
english
ipa
overall
a
but
more
sweet
initially
than
anticipated
but
definitely
a
bitter
hop
dominated
brew
citrus
was
somewhat
muted
but
still
added
complexity
great
beer
from
great
lakes
serving
type
bottle
o
easy
to
drink
and
good
alcohol
content
for
this
mellow
ipa
it
doesnt
stand
out
but
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
o
pleasantly
surprised
with
beer
since
it
was
two
weeks
past
the
best
buy
date
this
beer
was
very
enjoyable
and
well
worth
seeking
out
the
hops
seem
to
hold
up
very
well
o
this
a
beer
a
will
be
having
over
and
over
again
the
full
flavor
and
bitterness
mix
well
and
have
a
good
balance
o
a
pretty
decent
ipa
the
balance
isnt
bad
it
could
use
a
little
more
nose
and
i
generally
prefer
a
little
less
bitterness
and
more
depth
of
flavor
would
drink
again
o
this
is
another
very
solid
beer
from
great
lakes
i
dont
think
ive
had
a
beer
from
gl
that
i
dont
like
it
is
as
smoot
as
a
babies
bottom
and
is
inexpensive
enough
to
be
a
mainstay
in
my
fridge
k
thick
sticky
lacing
throughout
the
drink
smelled
of
strong
hops
with
a
touch
of
fruits
the
taste
was
nice
and
bitter
with
the
hops
strong
and
dry
at
the
finish
somewhat
like
two
hearted
only
not
the
grapefruit
tones
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
slightly
thick
while
going
down
smooth
very
drinkable
and
i
could
feel
a
slight
buzz
after
savoring
a
glass
for
about
15
minutes
this
was
very
good
ipa
with
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
and
not
too
expensive

a
six
i
will
definitely
pick
some
more
of
this
up
as
its
about
2
503
00
cheaper
than
two
hearted
and
very
near
as
good
nice
job
great
lakes
omy
first
glbc
beer
a
solid
ipa
would
have
liked
to
seen
a
little
bit
more
bitterness
in
there
o
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
i
was
happy
to
try
this
and
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
better
ipas
on
the
market
o
fantastic
beer
great
brewery
superdrinkable
and
equally
tasty
hoppy
but
not
overly
so
sweetness
offers
a
nice
balance
recommended
fo
sho
this
is
an
english
ipa
i
really
had
no
idea
this
classification
is
irrelevant
to
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
great
its
easy
drinking
and
excellently
balanced
i
would
buy
more
of
this
if
i
could
bonus
points
for
the
fact
that
i
cant
really
say
anything
negative
about
this
beer
d
a
tasty
eipa
from
great
lakes
this
style
is
nice
to
see
the
balance
of
english
hops
with
a
tasty
malty
backbone
great
balance
o
well
balanced
and
drinkable
a
pleasant
tasty
variation
of
ipa
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
copper
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
on
top
the
lacing
was
sticky
and
held
a
good
retention
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
more
earthy
hop
aroma
than
a
citrus
one
the
taste
is
like
the
nose
its
a
much
more
mellow
ipa
since
its
heading
in
the
english
direction
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
remains
drinkable
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
beer
is
a
good
i
feel
that
its
not
my
favorite
ipa
out
there
but
i
like
something
with
a
little
more
kick
to
it
i
feel
this
is
a
good
ipa
for
someone
who
might
be
looking
to
try
this
style
to
get
a
feel
for
where
they
can
go
from
there
trying
the
great
lakes
commodore
perry
ipa
dont
give
up
the
sip
great
motto
the
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
thin
white
head
that
is
lacing
in
my
pint
glass
the
smell
is
has
a
apricotcitrus
base
with
subtle
spice
the
taste
is
powered
by
hops
it
starts
very
bitter
then
a
apricot
shaunters
in
followed
by
more
bitter
there
is
a
tinge
of
metallic
taste
and
the
abv
is
not
fully
masked
the
mouthfeel
is
a
full
bodied
ale
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
taste
beer
and
highly
recommended
this
beer
definitely
is
more
english
ipa
than
west
coast
ipa
overall
bottle
dated
best
by
date
112011
not
bad
for
a
traditional
styled
ipa
perhaps
some
of
its
malt
characteristics
would
have
come
through
if
it
wasnt
slightly
past
its
shelflife
date
i
picked
it
up
in
ohio
in
midoctober
thus
i
think
the
bottle
date
is
a
bestbydate
overall
i
love
that
this
avoids
either
coast
and
offers
a
ballsy
approach
of
its
own
loads
of
hop
flavor
refuse
to
be
tied
down
easy
drinking
at
first
but
more
than
a
few
would
leave
nothing
but
bitterness
for
days
o
interesting
beer
glad
i
tried
it
wont
seek
it
out
opretty
on
point
very
drinkable
and
nice
clean
beer
o
this
was
a
little
to
malty
for
at
the
beginning
once
the
beer
warmed
some
of
the
better
flavors
i
was
expecting
came
out
but
it
took
too
long
for
this
to
happen
o
good
but
the
grapefruit
in
the
end
kinda
ruins
the
nice
pineapple
flavors
hop
presence
is
incredible
and
beats
everything
else
to
my
tastebuds
but
this
is
still
a
balanced
beer
that
is
a
great
ipa
o
an
ok
brew
i
just
couldnt
get
over
the
feeling
that
it
was
somehow
chemical
in
taste
and
smell
very
odd
considering
the
high
quality
of
the
other
beers
i
have
had
from
great
lakes
a
little
disappointed
by
this
one
do
at
least
good
overall
drinkability
would
be
good
but
the
abv
drives
it
down
for
me
3
5
o
a
solid
tasty
ipa
another
testament
to
great
lakes
ability
to
consistently
produce
quality
brews
definitely
worth
picking
up
a
pack
of
this
o
a
solid
ipa
i
usually
dont
care
for
ipas
but
this
one
on
i
would
try
again
if
you
drink
out
of
a
bottle
be
sure
to
wipe
off
cap
area
has
the
standard
great
lakes
rusty
top
taste
even
after
a
wipe
overall
not
bad
drinkable
nice
malts
blended
with
a
nice
grassy
earthy
hop
but
light
bitterness
a
much
lighter
drinking
beer
than
i
expected
great
lakes
does
not
disappoint
overall
its
a
refreshing
ipa
thats
easy
to
drink
in
terms
of
ipas
there
are
much
better
ones
out
there
if
youre
not
into
ipas
i
would
say
that
this
is
worth
a
try
for
those
who
want
a
stronger
ipa
you
probably
wont
be
blown
away
by
this
price
point
great
lakes
mixed
case
for
15
99
one
of
the
best
brews
i
have
had
incredible
taste
that
is
very
well
balanced
starts
off
like
a
rich
amber
ale
but
then
a
peppery
hop
flavor
takes
over
this
is
smooth
ipa
which
i
attribute
to
the
thick
body
theres
a
fruity
sweetness
that
brings
an
interesting
balance
to
this
brew
o
a
good
not
great
ipa
i
wont
reach
for
it
often
but
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
o
a
good
enough
beer
but
it
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
it
has
a
light
body
and
sits
lightly
on
your
tongue
very
drinkable
and
still
bitter
what
a
balance
pours
a
deep
amber
color
that
borders
on
copper
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
shows
moderate
retention
and
lace
smells
of
earthy
citrus
and
piney
hops
with
a
solid
caramel
and
bread
malt
backbone
the
taste
holds
no
surprises
that
the
nose
couldnt
ferret
out
caramel
and
bread
assaulted
by
earth
pine
and
citrus
i
was
a
bit
surprised
to
see
this
listed
as
an
english
style
ipa
as
i
saw
lots
of
american
in
there
medium
body
and
carbonation
level
with
a
sweet
honey
like
mouthfeel
great
ipa
i
wish
it
were
a
bit
easier
to
get
in
my
corner
of
the
planet
the
beer
has
a
very
nice
dry
hoppy
flavor
with
an
underlying
creamy
malty
sweetness
theres
nothing
new
or
earthshattering
here
nobodys
getting
too
fancy
its
just
a
simple
wellexecuted
american
ipa
not
the
best
ive
had
but
very
good
and
a
terrific
bargain
where
i
shop
bravo
cheers
note
tasted
on
1202012
freshness
date
3152012
well
done
great
lakes
d
this
is
a
pretty
solid
ipa
even
though
it
was
past
its
freshness
i
thought
it
still
packed
a
hop
punch
that
would
have
been
there
if
it
was
fresh
this
is
only
the
second
beer
i
have
had
from
gl
but
i
have
been
very
impressed
from
what
i
have
thus
far
o
very
easy
drinker
good
example
of
this
style
another
excellent
beer
from
great
lakes
definitely
worth
a
try
and
is
highly
recommended
solid
beer
no
surprise
from
glbc
and
a
nice
change
from
in
your
face
ipa
i
wish
they
sold
in
indy
so
i
could
buy
regularly
o
ive
said
it
over
and
over
again
the
guys
at
glbc
really
have
it
together
the
image
of
creating
just
one
world
class
brew
is
one
thing
but
for
a
brewery
to
hit
the
world
class
mark
in
a
variety
of
styles
is
something
to
hang
your
hat
on
and
its
something
for
me
to
tip
my
hat
to
this
ipa
can
stand
up
to
any
in
the
world
europe
and
the
u
s
atlantic
coast
to
the
pacific
and
everything
in
between
one
of
the
best
ipa
styles
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
very
well
made
ipa
definitalely
a
celebration
of
hops
not
what
i
would
call
perfectly
balance
nor
sessionable
notes
this
beer
is
not
a
clone
of
anything
it
is
one
of
a
kind
as
if
great
lakes
decided
not
to
just
assemble
a
by
the
numbers
grapefruit
and
pine
ipa
i
am
not
a
hops
expert
but
did
they
assemble
their
own
unique
blend
for
this
beer
this
is
a
craft
beer
drinkers
beer
meaning
an
experienced
drinker
will
recognize
the
thought
that
went
into
its
construction
in
general
i
love
great
lakes
brewing
along
with
brooklyn
brewing
as
being
my
favorite
brewery
im
not
sure
however
i
love
this
beer
certainly
it
is
not
love
at
first
sip
i
think
my
relationship
with
this
beer
needs
to
develop
pours
clear
and
medium
gold
with
lively
cascading
carbonation
a
thick
foamy
spongy
white
head
leaves
behind
some
clumps
of
lacing
behind
the
nose
shows
citrusy
grassy
hops
over
pale
caramelized
malts
flavors
turn
a
bit
more
resinous
with
substantial
grassy
hops
and
sharp
grapefruit
outweighing
a
basic
caramel
malt
background
the
medium
body
is
smooth
dry
and
spicy
in
the
mouth
finishes
with
biting
bitterness
as
the
sharp
hops
surge
forward
on
the
close
a
bit
basic
though
randall
cant
say
much
that
hasnt
been
said
already
one
thing
about
this
beer
is
it
is
remarkably
sessionable
which
is
kinda
scary
considering
the
7
5
abv
the
beer
feels
rather
thin
for
an
ipa
and
i
think
thats
what
makes
it
go
down
so
easy
get
a
6
pack
stay
home
and
enjoy
orange
amber
pour
with
decent
lacing
smells
of
grapefruit
and
pine
needles
taste
has
a
caramel
sweetness
to
it
and
a
good
amount
of
citrusy
hops
as
well
not
over
the
top
hoppy
for
a
big
boy
ipa
7
5
abv
sorta
balanced
actually
i
suspect
this
beer
has
some
age
on
it
oh
well
mouthfeel
is
thinnish
carbonation
may
have
faded
a
bit
along
with
the
hop
profile
finishes
sweet
overall
a
good
ipa
and
if
i
see
this
on
tap
somethere
ill
certainly
try
it
again
i
can
see
this
being
a
decent
standin
for
my
northeast
staple
ipas
like
long
trail
harpoon
and
my
all
time
favorite
mayflower
though
all
that
bitterness
makes
it
a
bit
less
sessionable
than
what
i
like
to
see
in
widely
available
standard
pub
ipa
such
as
this
o
went
down
great
on
a
nice
hot
day
4
gross
i
dumped
it
while
frowning
overall
a
solid
ipa
overall
a
great
ipa
around
here
in
ohio
this
can
be
found
for
8
996pack
so
compared
to
other
out
of
state
brews
this
is
not
only
a
good
beer
but
a
pretty
good
deal
as
well
d
disappeared
quick
wish
i
would
have
brought
more
back
home
with
me
great
rendition
of
a
delicious
english
style
that
is
underappreciated
here
overall
i
enjoyed
this
and
would
recommend
i
will
buy
more
i
think
great
lakes
is
a
very
solid
brewery
a
rather
unique
ipa
distinct
and
hoppy
and
while
i
love
hoppy
beers
this
isnt
really
quite
what
i
look
for
in
them
o
this
beer
looked
amazing
but
thats
where
the
great
qualities
ended
for
me
the
smell
was
weak
and
the
taste
was
just
off
the
first
beer
from
great
lakes
that
i
have
not
liked
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
great
lakes
has
added
another
flagship
to
the
fleet
and
its
commodore
is
perry
overall
not
a
bad
beer
it
is
enjoyable
and
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
it
is
not
memorable
overall
an
excellent
beer
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
an
ipa
overall
this
beer
is
fairly
good
overall
has
a
very
dry
finish
with
citrusy
notes
that
are
both
bitter
and
sweet
this
beer
is
so
lively
and
intense
with
each
swirl
i
could
drive
through
a
six
pack
with
no
problem
juicy
hop
burps
mmm
one
of
the
better
english
style
ipas
fo
sho
an
excellent
ipa
if
not
a
bit
upfront
hoppy
and
sweet
to
be
considered
a
true
english
ipa
nonetheless
tasty
and
one
of
my
favorite
of
the
glbc
offerings
grab
one
for
sure
very
good
ipa
although
more
caramel
malt
that
i
normally
like
in
the
style
o
this
was
a
nice
reprieve
from
my
usual
ipa
suspects
that
are
always
in
the
fridge
not
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
them
but
this
was
a
nice
changeup
really
liked
the
tropical
fruit
with
a
floral
and
pine
resin
bite
that
was
blended
smoothly
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
a
great
take
on
an
english
ipa
though
quite
maltcentric
this
beer
still
has
a
strong
hop
signature
that
lends
it
nice
complexity
surprisingly
sweet
in
that
first
rush
of
flavortheres
a
lot
of
caramel
coming
through
in
this
one
with
7
5
abv
this
beer
provides
a
nice
kick
without
a
significant
rubbing
alcohol
taste
coming
through
a
beer
that
im
sure
i
would
come
to
appreciate
more
with
further
tastings
overall
well
done
great
lakes
yet
another
beer
i
need
to
stop
overlooking
at
the
store
simply
because
i
have
had
it
numerous
times
do
i
dont
know
why
i
passed
this
up
for
so
long
even
as
great
lakes
is
one
of
my
more
favorite
breweries
no
longer
solid
solid
solid
ipa
likewise
with
the
brewery
o
an
expertly
crafted
exceptional
ipa
with
excellent
balance
it
does
everything
very
well
this
beer
has
a
thick
rocky
off
white
head
and
a
bronze
colored
body
it
is
a
good
looking
beer
for
an
ipa
i
thought
it
had
a
wonderful
malty
smell
that
reminds
me
of
biscuits
the
flavor
is
nice
it
carries
the
traits
of
the
hops
without
an
awkward
bitterness
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
some
carbonation
bite
onot
the
best
i
like
my
ipas
to
be
hop
bombs
but
this
was
way
too
malty
for
me
it
was
poured
in
a
16
ounce
glass
and
looked
amazing
very
dark
and
rich
smelled
exactly
as
it
looked
the
taste
was
fascinating
in
every
sense
of
the
word
i
will
definitely
look
to
grab
a
bottle
next
time
i
visit
home
i
have
had
a
strange
craving
for
one
ever
since
i
tried
it
overall
its
an
ok
ipa
not
loving
the
hops
profile
now
looking
at
the
great
lakes
website
its
bittered
with
simcoe
and
flavored
with
fuggles
and
cascade
that
explains
it
overall
it
was
a
good
eipa
i
enjoyed
the
sweetness
in
this
one
and
for
some
reason
would
liked
it
to
have
a
little
more
maybe
some
honey
nevertheless
its
a
goodin
and
should
be
drank
by
all
medium
mouthfeel
with
very
little
notice
of
the
alcohol
overall
not
my
preferred
type
of
ipa
but
a
solid
effort
and
very
drinkable
total
4
08
a
overall
this
one
goes
to
show
you
that
english
ipas
can
appease
those
who
prefer
typical
west
coast
american
ipas
with
that
said
i
think
my
overall
rating
has
to
be
about
average
3
this
is
not
something
youd
catch
me
drinking
on
a
regular
basis
but
it
is
a
nice
english
ipa
offering
and
i
would
have
it
again
overall
worth
a
try
this
beer
is
perfect
for
any
bbq
or
bonfire
or
een
a
mow
of
the
lawn
well
priced
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
have
not
had
a
gl
beer
that
disappointed
this
is
one
of
the
best
i
was
really
surprised
this
was
a
fresh
bottle
and
the
flavor
rivaled
that
found
in
two
hearted
this
vaults
up
to
my
top
23
ipas
list
and
given
the
pricepoint
will
be
a
regular
o
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
good
englishstyle
ipa
quite
quaffable
nice
finish
o
good
representation
of
the
style
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
prefer
american
ipa
but
will
come
back
to
this
english
style
ipa
occasionally
d
good
tasting
brew
lighter
tasting
brew
than
expected
but
still
pretty
enjoyable
none
the
less
a
well
balanced
brew
that
i
would
have
again
commodore
perry
is
a
damn
good
english
ipa
but
i
guess
it
also
doesnt
have
anything
that
really
piques
my
enjoyment
of
it
o
i
personally
love
a
strong
taste
and
full
body
to
my
beers
and
ipas
represent
just
that
philosophy
in
a
brew
i
thought
this
one
was
excellent
it
might
be
a
touch
better
for
some
people
if
its
bitterness
was
a
point
or
two
lower
but
of
course
that
just
isnt
the
style
intention
a
very
nice
well
balanced
beer
pours
golden
with
a
fine
white
head
smells
sweet
and
malty
but
married
beautifully
with
citrusy
hops
the
taste
is
similar
but
much
more
hop
forward
lovely
notes
of
sticky
pine
and
a
very
nice
finish
i
love
how
everything
comes
together
with
this
beer
the
sum
seems
more
than
its
parts
just
a
great
beer
for
sipping
on
the
back
porch
on
a
warm
spring
day
serving
12oz
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
overall
it
was
worth
the
wait
to
find
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
but
i
feel
it
probably
would
drink
rather
well
even
beyond
the
best
by
date
still
it
may
be
best
to
find
the
freshest
you
can
and
i
would
appreciate
finding
this
in
a
variety
case
or
a
six
pack
fresh
for
around
10
bucks
solid
ipa
overall
while
i
prefer
american
ipas
to
english
this
beer
stacks
up
well
and
would
be
in
my
rotation
if
it
was
distributed
in
my
area
mildly
carbonated
and
slightly
oily
in
the
middle
finishes
up
a
little
warm
would
like
to
review
this
with
a
newer
bottle
still
pretty
solid
english
ipa
easily
drinkable
at
7
5
not
as
robust
as
others
but
still
a
good
brew
and
one
that
i
would
pick
up
again
this
kind
of
reminds
me
of
an
esb
only
a
tad
more
bitter
nothing
overly
complicated
just
down
right
enjoyable
overall
i
cant
complain
because
mater
gave
me
this
as
an
extra
it
did
have
a
citrus
hop
nose
and
tongue
i
wouldnt
spend
my
money
on
this
one
but
thats
cause
ive
had
my
shot
it
is
worth
a
try
at
a
reasonable
price
warrants
buying
a
sixpack
a
rare
thing
alcohol
is
only
felt
as
a
soothing
belly
warmth
it
just
takes
one
to
put
you
at
ease
o
a
very
good
english
ipa
fits
the
style
perfectly
but
also
provides
a
good
overall
ipa
taste
overall
very
enjoyable
will
certainly
revisit
it
could
even
be
seen
as
a
good
intro
to
ipa
beer
for
those
friends
you
are
looking
to
get
into
craft
beer
clean
and
crisp
not
as
hoppy
as
i
had
hoped
but
a
good
ipa
nonetheless
overall
very
tasty
and
well
balanced
ipa
overall
it
was
very
balanced
and
very
easy
to
drink
it
wouldnt
be
a
problem
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
several
at
a
time
overall
i
was
very
impressed
actually
its
no
wonder
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
of
its
style
definitely
showcases
a
lot
of
hoppyness
i
was
impressed
good
work
great
lakes
overall
it
was
a
very
nice
ipa
not
the
best
that
great
lakes
offers
however
it
was
good
o
a
pretty
solid
english
ipa
nothing
exceptional
about
it
but
far
from
bad
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
got
through
it
easily
enough
though
pours
out
a
pale
straw
yellow
color
characteristic
of
the
style
has
some
head
to
it
but
what
strikes
me
more
is
the
smell
this
is
probably
the
maltiest
ipa
i
have
ever
had
has
a
huge
fresh
bready
smell
with
some
tangy
ripe
fruit
hops
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
but
quite
balanced
for
such
a
hoppy
beer
some
sweet
toasty
malts
but
with
clean
bitter
grassy
aftertastes
i
would
describe
the
hops
as
mostly
herbal
slightly
citric
and
dry
almost
like
a
pilsner
the
hop
profile
is
more
english
bitter
to
me
than
apa
less
emphasis
on
the
cascades
more
on
the
balance
between
malt
and
bitter
hops
interesting
mouthfeel
is
rich
yet
pretty
smooth
overall
this
is
a
unique
interpretation
of
the
style
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
an
ipa
in
a
world
of
cascade
infused
hopbombs
o
overall
a
fair
ipa
but
not
one
to
write
home
about
a
good
beer
but
far
from
the
best
great
lakes
has
to
offer
does
a
good
job
of
hiding
the
7
5
o
a
really
nice
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
i
am
wish
great
lakes
would
ship
to
delaware
andor
maryland
so
i
could
get
this
more
often
i
feel
this
is
a
great
everyday
beer
o
very
approachable
easy
to
drink
while
still
being
a
contender
in
the
ipa
world
not
shy
o
fairly
drinkable
the
bitter
aftertaste
will
slow
you
down
a
bit
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
that
i
wont
pass
up
on
my
next
trip
to
chucks
in
bowling
green
d
highly
drinkable
its
just
so
tasty
overall
im
not
sure
if
i
would
revisit
this
in
6
pack
form
but
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
at
a
bar
it
didnt
have
a
standout
taste
but
there
was
a
welldefined
flavor
worth
checking
out
a
good
beer
at
any
point
in
the
rotation
taste
thick
body
notes
of
chocolate
caramel
and
toffee
crisp
floral
and
citrus
hops
with
a
lingering
bitterness
that
is
balanced
well
with
the
malts
ends
dry
with
a
sharp
bitter
hop
flavor
you
can
smell
the
hops
when
the
glass
is
still
several
inches
away
from
your
nose
best
by
42511
d
one
of
the
better
english
style
ipas
that
i
have
come
across
at
7
5
abv
you
get
a
pretty
solid
hit
for
an
ipa
there
is
a
definite
alcohol
taste
but
it
actually
balances
against
the
malt
and
hops
profiles
overall
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
this
would
pair
nicely
with
a
homemade
pizza
definitely
something
ill
get
again
at
any
rate
an
excellent
brew
highly
recommended
d
extremely
drinkable
this
one
goes
down
easily
quickly
and
with
plenty
of
enjoyment
the
hops
might
not
be
out
in
force
as
much
as
in
many
american
ipas
but
great
lakes
used
the
english
style
to
make
this
beer
hugely
drinkable
background
malts
hate
to
call
them
that
as
theyre
good
in
their
own
right
but
im
really
digging
the
hops
here
balance
the
hops
flawlessly
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
and
one
i
would
look
for
again
real
tasty
beer
another
great
lakes
winner
and
just
good
all
around
hazy
orange
with
hops
and
fruit
in
the
nose
the
first
thing
i
notice
in
the
taste
is
some
malt
but
the
hops
certainly
make
their
entrance
known
with
a
fruity
finish
the
aftertaste
is
lingering
bitterness
and
peach
pretty
dry
too
hops
are
pretty
big
but
not
so
much
as
to
make
it
undrinkable
ive
had
more
aggressive
and
less
aggressive
ipas
i
like
that
there
is
some
complexity
other
than
a
hop
bludgeoning
and
nothing
else
drinkability
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
beer
it
didnt
over
impress
but
was
ok
cheers
mouthfeel
drinkability
bitter
and
hoppy
with
light
citrus
you
can
tell
it
is
brewed
with
goodquality
hops
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
and
dont
you
dare
give
up
the
sip
d
i
might
be
able
to
drink
2
but
ipas
arent
my
mug
of
beer
so
as
with
most
glbc
you
cant
really
feeltaste
the
abv
7
5
so
could
be
dangerous
another
good
beer
for
the
springsummer
d
so
so
drinkable
this
beer
goes
down
so
well
such
a
good
mix
of
sweet
and
bitter
this
is
the
beer
that
pushed
me
over
the
craft
beer
edge
and
it
is
as
good
now
as
it
was
then
onced
served
on
the
glass
its
appeal
its
very
enticing
the
first
taste
its
a
little
too
hoopie
when
you
are
on
your
third
fourth
sip
you
dont
taste
the
hop
as
much
once
your
glass
is
empty
you
want
more
of
this
unique
tasty
beer
the
smell
is
great
and
fresh
d
two
or
three
especially
with
food
would
be
very
enjoyable
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
and
on
tap
as
well
poured
a
deep
fiery
copperish
red
pour
with
a
small
head
that
dissipates
to
a
film
and
coats
fairly
well
this
beer
looks
fiesty
just
by
its
color
aromas
are
hoppy
floral
and
citrus
weighing
heavily
on
the
palate
taste
is
similar
an
extreme
bitterness
balanced
with
nice
grapefruit
citrus
in
the
body
and
a
more
mellow
finish
that
still
rings
in
with
a
sturdy
citrus
bitterness
touches
of
pine
and
resin
are
hard
to
find
as
this
is
a
major
grapefruit
tartness
bomb
a
pretty
good
ipa
with
a
malt
profile
that
loses
itself
in
the
grapefruit
drink
i
prefer
the
more
fruityjuicy
pale
ales
but
this
is
still
a
solid
brew
it
reminded
me
of
the
pale
ales
made
my
one
of
my
somewhat
local
brewers
les
trois
mousquetaires
overall
my
first
impression
was
that
this
was
a
balanced
beer
but
after
two
bottles
its
apparent
that
this
is
a
bitter
hop
bomb
of
a
beer
nice
to
try
big
ipas
that
use
noble
hops
in
abundance
recommended
this
is
truly
great
beer
a
shining
example
of
the
brewmasters
art
it
has
all
of
the
best
qualities
of
the
style
in
abundance
and
flavor
that
never
quits
when
i
have
a
glass
of
this
i
want
my
mouth
to
never
be
empty
yes
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
more
importantly
its
bursting
with
flavor
thats
not
only
devoid
of
unpleasant
aftertastes
but
actually
leaves
behind
a
subtle
craving
for
more
cant
get
enough
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
overall
this
was
an
ok
ipa
i
am
glad
i
finally
decided
to
try
this
one
and
i
would
by
it
again
a
great
beer
here
and
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
are
into
ipas
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
ive
had
the
privilege
to
try
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
in
an
ipa
still
a
decent
brew
non
the
less
very
underrated
ipa
although
its
different
from
alot
of
american
ipas
i
dont
really
see
this
being
an
english
ipa
although
i
see
how
one
can
think
that
bottom
line
great
ipa
unique
recommended
another
very
nice
beer
from
great
lakes
however
i
can
get
other
great
ipas
to
quench
my
hop
thirst
grapefruit
taste
up
front
with
grainy
malt
giving
it
some
body
high
abv
is
noticeable
with
alcoholvodka
flavors
rising
up
quickly
smells
of
grain
and
grass
with
slight
citrus
medium
body
at
first
but
thicker
after
it
washes
down
some
rough
edges
with
paper
and
dry
grass
a
good
ipa
not
great
but
good
enough
to
stick
with
as
a
goto
when
better
options
are
much
more
expensive
my
first
taste
of
perry
and
my
initial
reaction
is
that
its
a
hop
devil
clone
which
isnt
bad
at
all
a
very
typical
east
coast
ipa
light
in
color
nice
head
a
better
nose
than
hop
devil
im
not
sure
i
could
tell
the
difference
blind
folded
and
a
really
decent
brew
maybe
a
tad
bit
sweeter
on
the
finish
and
its
a
little
cheaper
not
earth
shaking
as
i
prefer
the
grapefruit
citrus
hit
where
this
one
is
thick
viscous
piney
earthy
kinda
ipa
worth
a
try
imo
perhaps
quality
has
drastically
changed
because
i
know
you
guys
on
here
give
really
honest
reviews
easy
to
drink
good
beer
comments
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
might
not
be
the
first
one
i
reach
for
in
the
future
but
it
wasnt
bad
and
is
worth
a
second
drink
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
its
dangerously
drinkable
for
its
7
5
abv
but
ill
try
to
stay
in
control
tonight
d
a
good
ipa
but
ive
had
ones
that
are
easier
to
drink
easy
to
drink
for
those
who
like
the
style
can
and
have
do
several
of
these
in
a
session
if
im
not
going
anywhere
for
a
while
the
abv
sneaks
up
on
you
the
flavors
mask
it
so
well
you
forget
its
even
there
an
excellent
rendition
of
a
classic
style
overall
this
is
a
goto
ipa
around
northeast
ohio
easy
to
find
and
reliably
tasty
great
lakes
really
does
not
make
a
below
average
beer
d
solid
ipa
i
could
have
a
few
but
need
time
between
beers
d
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
i
could
spend
an
afternoon
here
what
no
love
for
big
brother
matthew
and
his
forcing
open
of
japan
i
say
boo
sir
anyway
this
younger
sibling
pours
a
clear
light
amber
topped
by
a
fairly
shortlived
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
pine
flowers
light
greens
and
subdued
toffee
the
taste
ups
the
ante
with
the
flowers
and
pine
adds
a
decent
amount
of
orange
peel
and
tightens
the
leash
around
the
neck
of
the
toffee
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
sticky
finish
overall
a
pretty
good
eipa
but
its
way
too
onesided
for
my
liking
with
the
hops
coming
off
as
a
tad
harsh
overall
worth
a
try
but
there
are
better
out
there
in
fact
burning
river
pale
is
a
better
representation
of
a
hoppy
beer
from
this
brewery
drinkabilty
i
love
this
beer
and
having
it
fresh
on
tap
was
even
better
this
might
have
been
the
best
tap
beer
ive
had
yet
everyone
that
drank
it
agreed
it
was
like
we
brewed
it
in
the
room
then
poured
it
in
a
glass
cant
wait
to
get
more
many
more
only
reason
im
not
giving
it
a
5
rating
is
cause
well
it
is
7
5
alcohol
and
you
must
be
careful
drinkability
a
very
pleasant
and
well
balanced
ipa
i
do
like
the
citrus
flavor
two
or
three
max
due
to
the
bitter
end
but
very
enjoyable
this
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
and
is
a
terrific
example
of
a
brewery
showing
some
restraint
with
the
style
they
created
a
great
ipa
that
does
not
destroy
your
palette
after
a
few
beers
definitely
a
winner
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
good
session
beer
if
you
want
to
drink
a
lot
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
true
ipa
as
a
treat
there
are
plenty
of
better
ipas
out
there
d
wow
this
is
super
tasty
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
from
a
yankee
brewery
of
all
things
easy
drinking
and
enjoying
this
is
great
beer
pours
light
orange
with
one
and
a
half
fingers
of
head
and
some
moderate
lacing
the
smell
is
hops
and
citrus
specifically
some
grapefruit
with
a
mild
floral
presence
this
is
a
good
balance
of
sweet
malts
up
front
and
bitter
hops
to
follow
this
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
and
one
of
the
first
for
me
my
only
criticism
is
that
it
is
pretty
sweet
but
at
a
high
proof
and
strong
amount
of
malt
that
is
expected
it
is
medium
bodied
and
im
down
for
another
but
the
7
5
will
sneak
up
on
you
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
beer
not
great
but
good
to
try
for
an
ipa
if
you
have
access
it
has
a
unique
fruit
twist
on
an
ipa
d
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
drink
it
has
a
pleasant
smell
and
taste
that
goes
down
smoothly
for
me
at
least
its
a
topnotch
ipa
more
reviews
forthcoming
like
i
said
happy
to
be
back
to
reviewing
most
likely
tomorrow
will
be
a
review
of
east
end
fat
garys
nut
brown
on
draft
from
our
new
kegerator
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
bread
flowers
and
oranges
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
lot
of
flower
and
perfumeflavored
hops
some
oranges
and
bready
malt
low
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
really
loving
the
flavor
of
this
one
everything
else
is
pretty
standard
a
great
beer
easy
to
drink
and
very
flavorful
thanks
again
jon
for
this
great
brew
d
took
me
almost
45
minutes
to
finish
it
so
definitely
not
my
glass
of
beer
but
if
eipa
is
your
thing
then
definitely
try
it
drinkability
yesboth
tastyrefreshingwet
and
at
a
priceabv
thats
no
problem
while
this
can
be
a
beer
with
subtle
elegance
in
the
details
its
also
a
good
brew
to
just
swig
on
a
hot
ohio
summer
afternoon
this
is
somewhat
of
a
hybrid
between
an
american
and
english
ipa
it
seems
welldone
and
drinkable
overall
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
come
back
real
soon
a
nice
big
bold
highly
hopped
english
ipa
with
a
distinctive
american
twist
mouthfeel
was
huge
and
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
yet
another
winner
from
great
lakes
brewing
company
overall
if
you
like
grapefruit
especially
the
little
dividing
walls
then
you
will
love
this
beer
it
tastes
identical
to
the
fruit
it
is
a
bittersweet
treat
and
even
though
its
not
dropdead
delicious
it
is
an
extremely
drinkable
and
bold
interpretation
of
the
classic
style
dive
really
been
enjoying
this
beer
recently
its
a
very
flavorful
ipa
while
still
retaining
some
refreshing
drinkable
aspects
keeps
me
wanting
to
come
back
for
more
got
my
hands
on
a
six
pack
of
this
from
my
mid
west
connection
poured
into
a
goblet
pours
an
orange
amber
decent
lacing
nice
citrus
aroma
but
with
a
malty
backbone
has
a
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
overall
i
liked
it
but
not
sure
if
it
stands
up
to
the
other
beers
from
great
lakes
md
crisp
and
clean
not
super
heavy
i
enjoy
this
ipa
well
balanced
tastewise
the
juicy
grapefruit
hops
definitely
come
through
very
hoppy
from
the
getgo
not
a
shy
ipa
here
the
sweet
malt
base
is
also
noticeable
but
is
pretty
hidden
behind
the
bitterness
bitterness
lasts
quite
a
while
into
the
finish
and
aftertaste
too
it
may
not
be
the
most
bitter
ipa
ive
ever
had
but
its
among
the
top
all
aboard
mate
the
pour
sailed
out
of
a
bottle
with
a
slightly
darkerthanapplejuice
color
the
fresh
aroma
of
dry
beer
and
fruit
blockades
any
other
scents
from
making
birth
into
my
nose
all
in
all
commodore
perrys
brew
has
a
very
commanding
taste
as
theres
an
upfront
dry
hoppy
flavor
that
puts
my
taste
buds
in
a
knot
eventually
they
quickly
lift
up
anchor
and
give
way
to
a
fruity
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
about
average
so
i
wouldnt
say
it
outranks
other
brews
but
i
havent
had
anything
that
i
would
say
is
leagues
better
either
drinkability
factor
good
i
cant
fathom
why
i
waited
this
long
to
try
it
definitely
not
a
session
beer
due
to
the
alcohol
but
one
that
id
happily
go
back
to
repeatedly
very
drinkable
d
decent
drinkability
factor
some
dry
warming
pine
and
citrus
notes
come
in
late
to
save
this
of
its
dignity
moderate
enjoyment
nothing
that
i
would
seek
out
or
probably
drink
in
multiples
great
lake
commodore
perry
is
a
little
short
of
greatness
the
color
is
good
its
a
orange
hued
amber
with
white
foam
that
settles
to
a
thin
white
layer
the
beer
smells
minty
and
citrusy
from
hops
and
a
little
fruity
from
yeast
the
taste
is
very
complex
it
is
sweet
with
apples
grapes
and
pears
upfront
with
a
tinge
of
bitterness
that
gives
way
to
a
mouthful
of
toasted
wholegrain
bread
that
only
gives
way
to
a
drying
bitterness
in
the
end
after
the
swallow
the
bitterness
lingers
with
the
warming
astringency
of
alcohol
i
think
if
the
alcohol
was
less
obtrusive
and
hop
flavor
was
more
assertive
not
just
bitter
then
this
would
be
a
far
superior
beer
as
it
is
it
is
very
good
but
turning
down
the
malts
and
booze
a
little
on
this
beer
and
letting
the
hops
shine
a
little
more
would
be
a
benefit
a
really
impressive
effort
from
great
lakes
as
this
one
hits
the
spot
on
nearly
every
category
for
a
regular
ipa
commodore
perry
is
tough
to
beat
d
at
7
5
this
ipa
drinks
quite
nice
ive
had
this
brew
many
times
over
the
years
and
have
learned
that
when
fresh
which
this
pint
is
this
is
one
of
the
more
solid
ipas
available
year
round
another
solid
brew
from
great
lakes
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ipa
that
masks
the
abv
well
its
not
as
hoppy
as
i
would
like
but
at
the
same
time
the
lack
of
overthetop
acidity
of
a
lot
of
ipas
is
wellreceived
t
lots
more
of
that
grainy
mealy
malt
stuff
going
on
hops
come
and
try
to
redeem
everything
right
at
the
last
minute
they
give
a
nice
juicy
citrus
flavor
that
lasts
only
briefly
the
end
is
bitter
and
citrusy
dvery
smooth
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
even
though
the
abv
is
north
of
7
and
it
makes
you
want
another
one
when
your
done
d
not
available
enough
but
would
drink
often
otherwise
d
a
great
ipa
for
sure
with
all
the
ipas
on
the
market
however
im
not
sure
how
often
i
will
be
visiting
this
one
worth
trying
once
though
its
what
i
would
think
of
when
i
consider
an
east
coast
ipa
which
i
suppose
it
basically
is
i
also
would
think
of
it
as
an
ipa
from
before
the
lupulin
shift
that
was
brought
upon
us
by
beers
like
pliny
overall
solid
but
maybe
in
need
of
an
update
or
tweek
o
decent
offering
not
something
that
i
envision
to
be
a
goto
but
nothing
i
would
shy
away
from
in
the
future
overall
a
solid
beer
but
it
pales
in
comparison
to
some
of
the
best
in
class
i
like
it
for
what
it
is
though
a
very
accessable
reasonably
priced
quality
ipa
d
a
very
drinkable
ipa
i
could
definitely
make
this
a
session
beer
update
24
hours
later
i
had
4
beers
left
cracked
one
open
poured
it
into
the
aforementioned
goblet
inhaled
the
aromassipped
and
decided
this
is
better
than
i
first
thought
ipas
are
challenging
especially
to
a
firsttimer
this
is
an
ipa
i
would
recommend
for
a
firsttimer
it
has
grace
notes
of
what
should
be
expected
of
ipas
the
pine
grapefruitlingering
bitterness
citrus
and
citrus
zest
but
in
small
doses
enough
to
introduce
the
flavors
one
can
expect
without
the
full
frontal
assault
of
say
averys
maharaja
a
personal
favoriteor
even
green
flash
or
stone
ipa
for
under
8
per
6pack
this
ipa
tastes
like
a
more
expensive
ale
ill
get
more
drinkablity
easy
to
drink
bitter
with
decent
flavor
which
only
gets
better
with
a
few
drinks
i
wish
there
was
more
carbination
maybe
my
pour
was
too
aggressive
but
i
poured
how
i
always
do
in
any
event
a
lighter
and
brighter
mouthfeel
would
have
done
alot
for
this
not
bad
but
not
what
i
want
d
great
lakes
does
it
again
all
of
their
year
round
offerings
ive
tried
are
simple
and
easy
drinking
it
isnt
bad
wouldve
enjoyed
it
better
fresh
but
sometimes
what
can
you
do
the
mouthfeel
is
buttery
but
pleasant
this
makes
for
a
pleasant
sessional
quaff
when
below
deck
with
the
cabin
boy
who
will
someday
be
a
cabin
man
another
victory
from
great
lakes
drinkability
is
hurt
a
bit
by
the
off
flavors
and
aromas
that
though
they
dont
dominate
are
a
hindrance
to
the
overall
experience
not
my
ideal
ipa
by
any
means
pours
a
clean
yellow
to
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
mellow
grapefruity
hops
in
the
taste
bitter
grapefruit
and
a
bigger
malt
balance
a
citrus
hop
bite
and
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
grapefruit
citrus
hop
aftertaste
nice
big
hop
quite
balanced
almost
a
big
pale
ale
this
is
one
of
those
ipas
under
the
radar
that
should
be
mentioned
whenever
one
speaks
of
great
hoppy
midwestern
ipas
and
im
just
trying
it
for
the
first
time
myself
high
sessionability
for
those
with
high
lupulin
tolerance
we
hopheads
would
definitely
have
another
although
take
caution
as
this
one
can
sneek
up
on
you
in
a
hurry
d
easy
going
down
and
very
enjoyable
not
too
high
abv
so
you
can
enjoy
a
few
with
no
worries

buffalo

grassy
hops
atop
some
bready

caramel
sweet
maltiness
taste
has
a
prevalent
grapefruit
like
hop
bitterness
softened
by
notes
of
citrus
caramel
and
fresh
grain
nicely
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
sharp
crisp
mouthfeel
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
as
one
would
expect
from
an
ipa
and
easily
drinkable
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
the
best
example
of
an
ipa
normally
im
a
huge
fan
of
great
lakes
but
this
one
i
could
take
or
leave
drinkability
is
ok
i
would
seek
out
something
new
long
before
having
a
second
one
medium
to
full
bodied
creamy
smooth
the
carbonation
is
good
pretty
good
overall
but
i
would
like
this
better
if
it
was
not
so
sweet
and
if
the
biscuit
flavor
aroma
were
gone
as
an
american
ipa
could
stand
a
bit
more
in
the
hop
profile
but
honestly
that
is
just
competing
with
the
market
and
hop
overload
to
a
degree
i
found
this
beer
to
be
immensely
better
than
the
great
lakes
erie
monster
definitely
would
purchase
again
a
solid
ipa
worth
the
effort
a
new
ipa
for
mn
so
i
had
to
give
it
a
try
its
plenty
tasty
pretty
good
balance
between
sweetness
and
bitterness
almost
dipa
in
strength
and
taste
definitely
worth
a
try
d
very
light
and
drinkable
for
7
5
abv
another
great
ipa
this
beer
is
light
copper
with
a
white
head
the
hops
are
mild
in
smell
for
an
ipa
the
aroma
is
citrus
fruit
smell
this
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
the
hopsbitter
is
much
more
present
in
the
taste
hops
are
overwhelming
the
malt
in
a
good
way
the
hops
are
from
start
to
finish
and
beyond
thin
for
an
ipa
but
good
this
is
an
ipa
that
you
can
still
taste
on
your
tongue
in
the
morning
i
had
to
drink
three
over
two
days
before
i
realized
i
liked
it
it
grows
on
you
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
if
you
know
your
ipas
youre
not
going
to
get
a
crisp
finish
with
this
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
and
recommend
it
overall
i
had
higher
expectations
for
this
ipa
it
was
too
big
for
a
regular
ipa
and
too
much
alcohol
showed
probably
will
stick
to
something
else
even
though
this
is
in
mn
now
pours
golden
with
a
very
sticky
patchy
head
sort
of
a
fresh
fruity
apricotlike
aroma
besides
the
sweet
hops
with
some
malt
as
well
taste
is
big
palatecurling
hops
upfront
with
a
lot
of
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
a
total
bitter
citrus
and
hot
finish
toasty
as
well
an
absolute
hop
bomb
beautiful
golden
hue
welldeveloped
carbonation
inchthick
initial
head
that
dissipates
slowly
the
initial
nose
suggests
much
hops
with
clean
herbal
grassy
notes
very
nice
bitter
tones
on
the
center
of
my
palate
with
lingering
bitter
hops
at
the
upper
rear
the
malt
is
almost
overpowered
by
the
hops
but
quickly
establishes
a
fine
mellow
balance
medium
body
belgian
lace
is
very
well
developed
and
attractive
this
ipa
is
a
palate
cleanser
yet
moreish
the
abv
is
not
noticeable
the
hoppy
nose
is
evident
to
the
very
end
very
nicely
balanced
ipa
that
i
will
definitely
seek
out
again
drinkabiltity
is
good
not
great
solid
beer
though
definitely
worth
trying
d
i
would
qualify
this
as
an
average
ipa
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
outstanding
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
but
i
wouldnt
be
upset
if
it
showed
up
as
an
extra
on
a
positive
note
its
fairly
well
balanced
outside
of
the
slightly
bitter
end
and
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
one
of
the
best
nona
beers
out
there
believe
me
its
close
and
i
might
give
this
another
review
at
7
5
abv
i
am
amazed
at
how
quite
quaffable
this
one
is
even
as
the
ale
warms
in
the
glass
it
maintains
its
refreshing
qualities
another
winner
from
this
brewery
and
well
priced
compared
to
its
competitors
drinkability
highly
drinkable
and
wellmasked
alcohol
i
have
had
this
many
times
but
felt
i
couldnt
review
it
until
i
could
do
it
justice
poured
amber
with
a
big
frothy
head
that
left
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
you
can
smell
the
hops
coming
through
but
you
dont
truly
realize
how
hoppy
it
is
until
the
first
sip
while
there
is
a
definite
alcohol
taste
that
becomes
more
apparent
to
me
as
the
beer
warms
its
really
all
about
the
hops
here
while
the
alcohol
will
slow
you
down
a
bit
i
thought
it
was
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
d
i
certainly
enjoyed
this
enough
to
have
it
again
and
i
am
especially
interested
in
trying
a
fresher
bottle
to
see
if
there
is
more
hop
character
available
to
the
palate
o
for
a
pale
ale
i
believe
this
beer
has
some
significant
flaws
as
to
aroma
and
flavor
where
are
the
hops
the
only
real
hop
presence
is
in
the
finish
highly
suggest
more
hop
presence
in
flavor
and
aroma
style
suggests
moderate
to
high
hop
character
and
was
not
present
the
malt
character
is
great
just
needs
the
hops
which
are
the
bread
and
butter
of
this
style
drinkability
a
solid
offering
from
a
great
brewery
not
an
extreme
over
the
top
ipa
but
well
balanced
and
drinkable
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
ipa
and
quickly
becoming
my
go
to
beer
it
is
more
than
your
average
ipa
it
not
only
brings
west
coast
and
east
coast
styles
together
but
also
throws
some
belgian
funk
into
the
mix
d
solid
ipa
i
would
drink
this
again
for
sure
and
now
that
its
available
in
my
area
im
planning
on
picking
up
the
mixpack
soon
to
try
out
the
rest
of
the
lineup
drinkability
an
excellent
beer
actually
and
one
im
surprised
i
havent
tried
before
actually
great
lakes
get
thee
to
virginia
ive
been
continually
impressed
by
their
beers
and
their
lineup
is
consistently
wellmade
both
qcstyle
wise
as
well
as
substancetaste
aromawise
and
eminently
drinkable
recommended
to
anyone
who
likes
ipas
or
hell
wellmade
beer
overall
this
brew
is
good
but
missing
something
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
they
great
lakes
do
a
great
job
by
hiding
the
alcohol
but
for
an
ipa
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
hop
attack
for
8
99
a
six
tho
you
cant
beat
it
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
in
cleveland
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
tight
white
head
has
the
hop
smell
with
some
bready
malt
notes
a
nice
hop
bitterness
very
malty
though
very
smooth
and
remarkably
drinkable
for
its
abv
i
would
have
believed
this
was
a
5
a
very
nice
ipa
for
sipping
on
the
patio
on
this
beautiful
day
overall
a
handsome
tasty
wellcrafted
and
balanced
ipa
yum
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
large
white
head
that
fades
a
bit
too
quickly
heavy
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
pale
color
makes
me
think
the
malt
will
be
rather
submissive
full
of
grapefruit
and
pine
hop
aromas
smells
like
over
ripen
citrus
fruit
there
is
a
little
caramel
malt
in
the
flavor
but
otherwise
features
the
hops
with
a
lot
of
grapefruit
and
orange
bitterness
is
on
the
high
side
but
there
is
enough
hop
flavor
to
make
it
worthwhile
still
would
of
liked
more
malt
for
balance
medium
body
to
carry
the
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
nicely
carbonated
and
textured
the
high
bitterness
and
abv
limits
drinkability
taste
very
one
dimensional
not
balanced
just
bitter
little
hop
feel
lots
of
bitterness
alcohol
isnt
over
the
top
but
rears
its
head
enough
to
be
slightly
disagreeable
could
use
some
depth
to
it
a
decent
price
but
the
burning
river
is
so
much
more
enjoyable
still
have
3
more
in
the
6er
but
12
way
down
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
really
drinkable
beer
good
abv
imo
this
beer
is
da
bomb
with
any
food
really
washes
the
pallet
like
a
dry
cleaner
d
well
being
a
beer
lover
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
continue
to
enjoy
it
trough
out
the
years
thank
you
great
lakes
for
putting
a
smile
on
my
face
with
yet
another
delicious
ipa
dim
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
kind
of
a
mess
of
an
ipa
that
just
does
not
taste
very
good
to
me
overall
a
great
beer
and
could
become
my
go
to
beer
pours
a
dark
yellow
with
a
big
vibrant
head
aroma
is
fruity
with
pineapple
and
flowers
flavor
is
very
flowery
and
tropical
fruity
with
pineapple
jasmine
persimmon
quite
sweet
though
fairly
delicate
there
is
a
slow
orange
rind
bitterness
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
watery
excellent
beer
its
sure
to
be
a
regular
far
beyond
drinkable
in
my
book
of
yummyness
wow
its
clean
profile
and
balance
is
immaculately
woven
perfectly
together
for
some
heavy
imbibing
enjoy
some
commodore
i
say
yum
the
drinkability
is
decent
i
would
say
two
of
these
would
be
the
maximum
for
myself
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
ipa
that
has
balance
and
delivers
plenty
of
hop
bite
drinkability
this
is
both
a
well
balanced
beer
and
a
kick
ass
ipa
almost
could
be
called
a
dipa
or
maybe
it
could
be
called
a
big
english
ipa
or
maybe
it
is
simply
a
balanced
american
ipa
no
idea
but
i
am
very
impressed
drinkability
is
good
not
an
exceptional
ipa
in
my
opinion
but
its
not
bad
at
all
great
lakes
commodore
perry
ipa
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
i
like
the
aroma
grapefruit
and
pine
dominate
the
flavor
also
has
a
hoppy
profile
aroma
and
grapefruit
dominate
malt
is
there
in
the
back
though
alcohol
also
is
noticeable
i
like
this
one
probably
wont
be
drinking
this
again
but
great
lakes
makes
some
badass
beers
so
drinking
their
product
wont
be
a
problem
d
a
pretty
basic
ipa
that
doesnt
really
have
much
going
for
it
decent
flavor
but
pretty
light
body
the
is
a
great
ipa
nice
citrusy
hops
that
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
not
super
balanced
but
i
have
become
a
hophead
so
this
a
positive
for
me
pours
a
clear
yelloworange
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
is
pine
and
citrus
with
some
fruit
smells
maybe
a
hint
of
lemon
and
some
malt
the
taste
is
fresh
pine
and
a
crisp
pleasant
hop
hit
then
it
is
followed
by
some
fruit
and
a
malty
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
thin
to
me
for
an
ipa
kinda
light
but
it
has
high
drinkability
for
7
5
abv
they
go
down
fast
over
all
a
good
ipa
but
not
a
top
one
drinkability
very
good
its
something
i
could
drink
again
but
there
are
other
ipas
that
i
prefer
the
taste
is
almost
just
what
you
smell
huge
hop
notes
with
a
citrus
aftertaste
i
can
see
this
being
a
love
hate
beer
for
some
these
go
down
really
well
drinkability
is
good
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
for
me
and
is
not
bad
tasting
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
but
if
your
looking
for
a
more
hoppy
ipa
there
are
others
you
could
choose
from
but
still
not
a
bad
brew
d
for
7
5
this
goes
down
pretty
easy
the
crisp
and
light
taste
still
has
some
bitterness
i
did
like
the
beer
and
i
think
of
it
as
that
light
ipa
on
the
market
another
great
choice
from
great
lakespretty
good
ipa
clear
amber
colorsmells
decent
and
taste
of
hops
and
grape
fruit
could
posssibly
be
a
little
more
bitter
for
mebut
still
very
good
i
drink
this
often
and
always
keep
it
in
stock
cant
go
wrong
with
anything
from
great
lakes
d
again
this
was
at
a
pizza
place
not
what
i
would
consider
beer
bar
some
of
the
minor
flaws
may
be
related
to
the
glassware
or
age
of
the
beer
on
tap
still
overall
another
solid
selection
from
great
lakes
and
certainly
one
id
have
again
d
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
ipa
it
had
enjoyable
citrus
hops
and
smooth
caramel
malts
in
the
taste
and
i
thought
it
was
very
drinkable
would
have
again
drinkability
i
did
not
find
the
alcohol
very
noticeable
but
this
ipa
certainly
can
push
you
around
a
little
bit
great
for
a
short
session
md
an
odd
strongly
acidic
note
flares
up
in
the
finish
and
makes
my
mouth
salivate
profusely
some
tastebud
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
is
reacting
wildly
i
wonder
if
this
is
typical
or
if
it
is
a
fluke
occurrence
specific
to
my
palate
will
be
looking
other
reviews
to
investigate
either
way
it
is
a
dealbreaker
major
points
lost
will
not
be
getting
this
again
really
weird
aside
from
that
mouthfeel
is
moderately
thick
carbonation
on
the
light
side
finish
resiny
pours
a
very
nice
orange
color
with
a
white
billowy
head
probably
over
an
inch
high
leaves
nice
lacing
and
clings
very
well
a
very
good
looking
beer
the
smell
is
a
bit
subdued
a
little
grassy
a
little
lemon
zest
and
a
bit
of
toasty
sweet
malts
nothing
too
impressive
though
i
wouldnt
say
it
lacks
what
most
ipas
have
the
taste
comes
up
with
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
though
the
bitterness
is
nicely
balanced
with
some
grainy
malts
slightly
bready
slightly
crackery
the
hop
flavor
has
the
taste
of
lemons
and
sour
lemon
rinds
along
with
quite
a
bit
of
grass
and
resins
it
also
finishes
with
this
very
floral
slightly
estery
sting
mixed
in
with
a
pleasant
sweetness
pretty
good
but
i
think
there
is
just
a
little
bit
missing
as
far
as
i
can
tell
the
body
is
nice
medium
full
the
carbonation
is
not
incredibly
lively
but
its
definitely
there
but
the
weird
floral
feeling
kind
of
comes
back
this
sticky
but
not
like
hop
resins
sticky
kind
of
powdery
floral
feeling
not
the
most
pleasant
thing
the
beer
is
nice
to
drink
not
too
incredible
but
one
that
i
could
definitely
see
being
part
of
a
nice
night
maybe
one
to
go
back
to
depending
on
the
price
and
the
situation
but
not
an
ipa
that
id
go
to
if
i
was
looking
for
that
american
ipa
kind
of
beer
pretty
darn
good
beer
but
because
of
its
heft
im
not
sure
its
the
most
drinkable
in
the
style
wouldnt
want
to
be
drinking
too
many
of
these
on
a
warm
evening
in
words
attributed
to
abraham
lincoln
if
you
like
this
sort
of
thing
then
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
you
would
like
d
a
solid
ipa
and
yet
another
great
flagship
offering
from
gl
brewing
co
d
easy
to
drink
not
overbearing
excellent
balance
and
in
general
nice
flavors
make
this
an
excellent
beer
glad
to
try
it
4
a
perfect
example
of
no
coast
ipas
that
dont
get
enough
attention
damn
tasty
and
bold
enough
to
rival
both
coasts
this
beer
was
the
second
in
my
flight
of
three
at
rfd
in
chinatown
dc
it
was
pretty
good
smell
was
a
bit
sour
but
had
a
nice
floralhoppy
aroma
as
well
taste
was
bitter
and
hoppy
well
balanced
id
have
this
beer
again
draft
at
brewpub
the
brewmasterluke
had
just
finished
this
batch
but
had
not
put
on
tap
he
was
good
to
me
and
poured
me
a
glass
poured
hazy
amber
with
a
large
rocky
white
head
that
mostly
lasted
with
good
lacing
large
hoppy
aroma
medium
body
with
full
texture
and
soft
carbonation
very
good
well
balanced
hoppy
flavor
with
a
long
smooth
bitter
finish
dont
give
up
the
sip
overall
very
solid
offering
as
are
most
great
lakes
beers
i
enjoyed
this
though
it
was
not
standout
amongst
the
great
lakes
lineup
give
it
a
shot
if
you
have
the
chance
though
drinkabilty
extremely
drinkable
i
finish
it
almost
too
fast
for
that
much
abv
a
deep

try
4
00
what
a
bargain
this
is
an
exeptional
ipa
this
stuff
totally
rocks
great
lakes
has
always
done
a
outstanding
job
of
balance
in
their
brews
and
this
is
no
exception
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
this
one
out
for
all
your
citrushops
and
taste
desires
an
extremely
good
brew
this
is
a
lovely
offering
from
the
us
version
of
great
lakes
brewing
there
is
a
canadian
version
of
great
lakes
also
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
ipas
on
the
market
add
to
that
the
moderate
price
and
good
availability
and
we
have
a
sound
goto
ipa
potent
enough
to
satisfy
most
hopheads
this
is
a
solid
ipa
but
the
competition
is
pretty
stiff
in
the
world
of
ipas
and
im
not
sure
this
qualifies
as
one
of
the
better
ones
its
a
nice
enough
ipa
but
not
a
great
one
given
all
the
other
options
available
probably
wouldnt
order
it
again
notes
great
example
of
an
american
ipa
great
lakes
come
through
with
a
win
again
this
brew
served
chilled
shows
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
decent
frothy
white
head
and
great
lacing
the
aroma
sends
a
somewhat
astringent
floral
hops
swampy
and
a
bit
of
sour
mash
malt
the
taste
brings
a
much
mellower
nicer
blend
of
bready
malt
and
herbal
hops
its
a
mildly
carbonated
easy
drinking
ipa
with
a
mid
bodied
feel
kind
of
silky
with
heavy
grains
and
nice
woodsy
bitterness
it
really
grows
on
you
as
you
get
away
from
the
funky
aroma
that
kind
of
turned
me
off
in
the
end
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
ipa
thank
you
ohoove
very
representative
of
the
british
style
i
liked
it
a
lot
clear
gold
with
a
medium
white
head
nose
is
fruity
and
floral
with
some
tangerine
hops
lots
of
bitterness
with
some
grapefruit
coming
on
strong
slick
heavy
body
and
lowish
carbonation
quite
fruity
and
floral
in
flavour
and
just
enough
balancing
sweetness
not
the
best
this
brewery
has
to
offer
but
still
fairly
drinkable
d
this
wasnt
a
bad
english
ipa
there
were
a
lot
more
hops
than
what
i
was
expecting
and
thats
not
a
bad
thing
a
good
brew
to
try
from
great
lakes
i
love
this
beer
hides
7
2
abv
very
well
this
isnt
unpleasant
but
it
isnt
amazing
my
palate
is
skewed
due
to
all
the
big
beers
ive
been
drinking
ill
plan
on
rereviewing
this
one
later
d
a
very
smooth
ipa
could
easily
sit
back
and
have
a
few
of
these
at
once
after
having
another
glass
of
this
the
next
night
i
realized
that
the
last
one
must
have
been
a
bad
bottle
this
one
is
excellent
great
bold
flavor
very
wellbalanced
hops
and
malts
great
beer
especially
for
the
price
a
great
beer
something
ive
come
to
expect
from
great
lakes
d
could
drink
this
one
for
awhile
poured
from
a
chilled
12
oz
bottle
into
a
goblet
pours
a
clear
light
amber
with
no
head
just
a
fine
skim
on
top
aroma
is
malty
but
a
swirl
in
the
glass
brings
out
some
piney
hops
a
slight
sweetness
leads
and
the
flavor
is
full
of
pronounced
hops
fading
to
a
lingering
floral
fruitiness
the
hops
are
a
large
flavor
but
not
overwhelming
or
unbalanced
it
has
a
medium
body
and
coats
the
mouth
well
allowing
the
flavors
to
linger
on
lazy
slow
rising
bubbles
in
the
glass
defy
how
carbonated
the
beer
feels
on
the
tongue
a
medium
carbonation
adds
to
the
sharpness
of
the
hops
and
delivers
the
flavor
this
is
a
tasty
beer
one
which
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
for
one
who
likes
hops
served
from
a
chilled
bottle
into
a
chalice
the
beer
is
a
pretty
orange
color
like
a
pumpkin
beer
it
had
a
thin
head
of
white
bubbles
that
quickly
disappeared
it
left
a
bit
of
lacing
there
are
numerous
streams
of
bubbles
rising
in
the
glass
i
like
the
aroma
of
this
beer
hearty
citrus
hops
and
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
characterized
by
a
very
good
hop
character
slightly
bitter
at
first
the
hops
swell
into
a
fullblown
mouth
full
of
bitterness
its
dry
and
a
little
fruity
there
is
also
some
sweetness
mixed
in
for
good
measure
there
is
no
indication
this
is
a
7
5
abv
beverage
this
is
a
very
tasty
ipa
it
has
a
medium
body
but
its
a
hearty
medium
it
fills
your
mouth
with
flavor
and
leaves
a
good
coating
that
lingers
along
with
the
hop
aftertaste
but
it
also
makes
you
want
to
have
another
sip
this
is
a
great
session
ipa
nothing
about
it
is
overwhelming
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
im
kicking
myself
that
i
didnt
pick
up
more
than
one
bottle
d
easy
beer
to
drink
in
regards
to
its
style
and
higher
alcohol
content
overall
great
job
by
great
lakes
fun
to
read
the
bottle
and
admire
the
art
too
this
is
the
most
drinkable
englishstyle
ipa
ive
encountered
i
want
to
drink
more
but
have
limited
myself
to
two
because
of
the
7
alcohol
content
nice
head
great
floral
notes
and
a
wonderful
mild
fruity
finish
hoppy
but
not
overbearing
as
some
american
ipas
can
be
just
a
great
beer
maybe
one
to
try
if
you
have
a
friend
that
is
reluctant
to
try
an
ipa
due
to
the
overwhelming
hops
in
many
of
the
representatives
of
the
style
pours
a
clear
orangey
gold
color
with
a
goodsized
but
fairly
fizzy
white
head
aroma
is
sweet
citrus
and
malts
with
a
touch
of
spiciness
flavor
is
rather
bananaesque
to
me
for
some
reason
this
isnt
made
with
wheat
as
far
as
i
know
so
im
rather
confused
here
anyway
the
fruit
salad
theme
continues
with
grapefruit
and
lychee
which
makes
this
a
rather
sweet
beer
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
pretty
good
but
tasted
like
halfhefe
halfipa
to
me
feels
above
average
in
the
mouth
spot
on
carbonation
and
a
slick
oily
feel
make
this
one
easy
drinker
careful
though
as
the
alcohol
content
may
sneak
up
and
smack
you
over
the
head
mouthfeel
is
smooth
almost
creamy
medium
to
heavier
medium
body
very
drinkable
and
the
abv
is
pretty
much
nondetectable
the
taste
changed
as
i
worked
my
way
through
the
bottle
it
definitely
got
better
im
not
completely
sold
on
this
beer
but
its
interesting
enough
to
make
me
want
to
buy
more
poured
from
a
bottle
with
13010
freshest
date
on
the
bottle
poured
bright
copper
with
a
goldish
hue
decent
amount
of
head
with
little
extra
carbonation
strong
hoppy
pine
citruslike
scents
of
grapefruit
and
pineapple
alcohol
is
warming
more
scent
than
flavor
flavor
is
very
hoppy
hop
profile
is
a
little
dryer
than
i
would
enjoy
which
hinders
the
drinkable
nature
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
this
brew
finally
a
taste
and
i
immediately
realize
this
is
an
english
ipa
not
american
ipa
as
the
menu
states
oops
well
then
this
is
pretty
good
beer
is
a
little
dry
but
sweet
there
is
a
nice
hop
flavor
citrus
again
and
a
nice
bitterness
in
the
back
medium
bodied
which
is
appropriate
overall
a
good
eipa
smooth
and
drinkable
there
is
a
strange
bitter
asparagus
kind
of
taste
that
sits
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
definitely
hoppy
with
some
sourness
this
is
a
high
quality
beer
but
i
would
bet
it
would
be
brilliant
off
the
tap
or
out
of
a
cask
especially
aged
d
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
i
have
had
hopefully
we
will
continue
to
be
able
to
get
their
beer
in
new
york
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
pleasing
cream
white
head
of
above
a
finger
mixture
of
foam
and
bubbles
dissolves
at
a
steady
rapid
pace
does
leave
a
good
bit
of
lacing
behind
bright
cloudy
pumpkin
orange
color
semitranslucent
yellows
out
around
the
rims
clove
pepper
spice
and
forest
floor
matter
lichens
swirl
up
in
the
nose
tree
bark
and
fallen
limbs
too
sounds
crazy
but
theres
something
like
hunts
ketchup
in
there
sour
orange
zest
peach
and
apricot
pits
not
a
lot
of
sweetness
in
there
mediumbodied
mouth
entry
buoyed
by
foamy
carbonation
herbaceous
with
that
same
forestlike
earthiness
and
bark
notes
even
charcoal
flavorwise
not
much
maltiness
but
they
do
smooth
out
the
texture
some
orange
lemon
pith
on
the
sour
side
apricot
peach
red

red
cherry
fruit
more
metallic
as
it
goes
on
enough
here
has
one
scratching
ones
head
that
perhaps
this
bottle
is
not
representative
hmmm
pours
a
clear
amber
with
very
thick
head
and
lace
pungent
odor
of
hops
and
citrus
spices
taste
is
big
with
piney
hops
coriander
and
fruit
its
an
admirable
ipa
from
a
reputable
brewery
but
a
word
of
warning
it
packs
a
big
punch
two
or
three
of
these
and
youll
be
on
the
floor
quick
a
great
ipa
but
a
bit
too
sneaky
in
the
abv
dept
for
my
taste
drinkability
is
good
with
regards
to
taste
but
at
8
your
not
drinking
a
sixer
on
sunday
watching
the
game
or
are
you
the
mouth
is
a
little
thin
and
slick
leaves
a
light
silky
coating
on
the
palate
on
to
the
good
part
wow
this
is
a
really
wellmade
eipa
as
far
as
flavor
goes
big
citrusy
hops
at
the
forefront
but
they
mellow
beautifully
to
a
sweet
honey
finish
no
harsh
aftertaste
even
though
this
is
plenty
bitter
slight
drying
feel
on
the
finish
flavors
of
grapefruit
and
light
butterscotch
bring
up
the
rear
what
a
treat
this
beer
is
thanks
rich
for
this
stellar
beer
d
a
solid
ipa
a
little
heavy
on
the
citrus
without
the
grapefruitmalt
sweets
to
complement
but
when
im
in
the
mood
for
that
i
now
know
where
to
go
d
this
is
something
id
definitely
trade
for
again
a
very
solid
beer
dpretty
light
tasting
covering
the
alcohol
very
well
with
the
lighter
flavors
i
could
drink
many
and
it
would
probably
sneak
up
on
me
this
ipa
is
mostly
filled
with
spicy
and
floral
hops
the
nose
is
very
mediocre
when
i
smell
an
ipa
i
want
a
foral
bouquet
this
beer
is
a
spiciness
mixed
with
a
tad
bit
of
breadiness
there
is
a
tad
bit
of
floral
notes
the
flavour
of
the
beer
is
a
bitter
maltiness
and
a
huge
spiciness
a
bit
of
floral
notes
come
through
as
well
i
like
the
flavour
but
the
hop
profile
is
one
dimensional
id
like
a
little
bit
more
dryness
its
pretty
drinkable
too
solid
beer
by
great
lakes
drinkability
ill
give
it
this
it
does
go
really
well
with
a
meal
complimented
a
spicy
sweet
asian
stir
fry
well
but
you
need
to
keep
these
cold
which
means
drink
fast
which
also
is
a
problem
at
7
5
abv
overall
it
is
a
rather
enjoyable
ipa
it
is
not
my
favorite
beer
from
great
lakes
but
it
is
one
that
i
would
have
again
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
perfect
pint

pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
a
thin
layer
covering
the
beer
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
dominated
by
the
citrusness
of
the

of
the
citrusness

enjoying
the

the

dry
a
decent
ipa
for
the
most
part
however
i
tend
to
prefer
the
more
grapefruity
side
of
the
style
nonetheless
a
solid
ipa
the
aroma
was
light
with
hints
of
grapefruit
and
bitter
trailing

flavor
followed
the

not
an
overpowering
ipa
but
just
clean
crisp
and

a
fun
ipa
and
very
drinkable
just
makes
you
want
more
solid
ipa
nothing
too
original
but
everything
you
desire
when
picking
one
up
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ipa
with
an
inviting
hoppy
scent
and
a
smooth

taste
god
forbid
they
violate
the
bavarian
purity
lawtheres
nothing
in
it
besides
barley
hops
yeast
and
water
given
those
constraints
great

does
a
fine
job
especially
at
masking
the
7

abv
i
taste
pine
licorice
and
malt
without
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
underneath
the
taste
is
drier
and
a
bit
less
complex
than
similar
ipas
it
makes
me
wonder
what
great

might
come
up
with
if
it
dared
violate
the
bpl
another
great
ipa
great
lakes
brewery
does
it
right
with
this
one
i
first
had
it
about
a
year
ago
and
forgot
how
much
i
liked
it
found
an
older
bottle
in
the
back
of
the
beer
fridge
and
couldnt
wait
to
open
the
bottle
poured
into
a
clean
glass
and
observed
a
nice
golden
color
with
an
attractive
smell
pretty
affordable
for
the
alcohol
by
volume
content
taste
is
dead
on
perfect
and
very
enjoyable
ill
continue
to
stock
my
fridge
with
this
ipa
this
is
a
tasty
ipa
nicely
balanced
and
surprisingly
complex
fine
fine
stuff
so
far
im
three
different
beers
into
my
great
lakes
stash
and
theyre
living
up
to
the
hype
from
where
im
sitting
another
bonus
from
new
blacksburgian
kels
thanks
drinkability
very
enjoyable
ipa
that
goes
down
quickly
if
you
are
looking
for
a
basic
apa
this
one
fits
the
bill
pretty
drinkable
ipa
commodore
perry
ipa
is
definitely
another
quality
brew
from
great
lakes
one
of
the
best
of
the
glbc
brews
in
my
opinion
pours
a
rather
weak
copper
more
of
a
dark
yellow
lager
color
with
with
some
decent
initial
head
and
some
very
nice
lacing
nice
scent
good
hop
fuggles
aroma
a
bit
beef
jerkyish
and
a
little
grassy
nice
flavor
though
i
thought
the
taste
was
more
of
an
english
pub
bitter
with
the
english
hops
taste
bit
of
nice
maltiness
but
nothing
too
strong
goes
down
very
well
for
a
7
5
beer
but
this
just
wasnt
an
ipa
more
of
an
enlgish
pale
or
special
bitter
as
far
as
taste
and
scent
goes
yum
d
the
7
5
abv
is
totally
hidden
in
this
beer
making
it
definitely
pack
quite
a
kick
its
aroma
started
to
develop
more
as
it
warmed
with
could
use
a
little
work
but
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
great
very
drinkable
ipa
that
will
also
knock
your
socks
off
notes
one
of
my
favorite
everyday
ipas
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
and
i
wouldnt
feel
like
i
was
sacrificing
in
flavor
at
all
by
having
to
go
to
a
session
beer
the
more
i
drank
and
the
more
the
beer
warmed
the
more
apparent
the
sweet
malt
became
both
in
the
taste
and
the
smell
of
this
beer
despite
the
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
solid
example
of
the
style
not
gonna
knock
your
socks
off
but
its
solid
where
it
should
be
check
it
out
d
good
flavor
associated
with
the
hops
with
the
sharp
finish
associated
with
hoppy
beers
very
nice
a
little
higher
abv
keeps
this
from
being
the
usual
session
ale
but
i
would
still
have
more
than
one
in
a
night
if
it
was
available
this
is
certainly
not
a
unique
take
on
the
style
but
it
is
an
ipa
i
am
not
sure
one
really
wants
unique
it
is
entirely
enjoyable
it
is
perhaps
a
touch
too
refined
in
its
bright
clean
interpretation
of
loud
hops
and
supporting
malt
but
that
doesnt
keep
it
from
being
a
great
example
of
the
style
recommended
overall
very
happy
with
the
purchase
and
a
solid
ipa
i
would
recommend
to
my
beer
nerd
friends
cheers
drinkability
this
is
a
american
ipa
that
i
can
drink
over
and
over
again
the
citrus
notes
from
the
aroma
are
not
as
prominent
in
the
flavor
medium
body
with
a
slightly
chewy
resinous
hop
forward
mouthfeel
there
is
only
a
slight
bit
of
citrus
peel
and
grapefruit
flavor
the
hops
are
very
earthy
and
plant
like
not
crisp
and
floral
the
malt
backbone
provides
a
decent
balance
with
some
nice
biscuit
notes
this
beer
is
a
decent
session
beer
that
is
kind
of
one
dimensional
pretty
good
but
not
something
i
would
drink
regularly
fine
example
of
an
ipa
just
a
little
too
bitter
on
the
aftertaste
for
me
md
the
mouthfeel
has
a
slight
unpleasant
hop
bite
im
usually
a
fan
of
hops
in
all
quantities
but
there
is
a
slight
bitter
pang
that
just
doesnt
agree
with
my
palate
ive
always
noticed
it
but
i
enjoy
the
rest
of
this
beer
so
much
i
tolerate
it
however
this
is
a
fantastic
goto
beer
and
its
an
easy
drinker
for
the
abv

a

one
thats
very
sessionable

one
that
could
easily
sneak
up
on
you
with
the
abv
levels
another
winner
from
great

i
hope
we
get
the
seasonals
as
they
keep
changing
and
the
months
go
on
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
with
a
modest
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
collar
i
dont
get
that
typical
citrus
aroma
not
much
of
anything
the
taste
was
a
watered
down
sweet
citrus
not
offensive
feel
was
medium
bodied
and
a
little
oily
drinkability
was
good
not
bad
a
safe
beer
this
might
be
a
good
one
to
introduce
to
someone
who
is
new
to
ipas
rather
than
an
extreme
hoppy
right
off
the
bat
md
this
one
definitely
has
some
body
to
it
as
well
as
an
ethanol
presence
and
at
7
5
it
should
be
expected
but
still
maintains
its
drinkability
d
this
bottle
to
me
is
unballanced
and
hard
to
enjoy
d
pretty
solid
could
easily
be
an
easy
everyday
drinker
lacking
in
complexity
and
umph
to
really
standout
however
d
this
is
a
great
offering
by
great
lakes
i
would
prefer
to
have
a
little
sweetness
in
this
brew
but
i
understand
that
the
style
doesnt
require
it
i
will
definately
return
to
commodore
perry
dont
give
up
the
sip
for
those
that
dont
think
this
beer
is
hoppy
it
is
a
different
monster
from
draft
it
had
a
real
nice
hop
bite
and
was
very
enjoyable
i
had
it
up
right
before
a
titan
ipa
which
i
love
and
they
were
neck
and
neck
in
taste
and
hoppiness
good

i
have
a
newfound
respect
for
it

abv
has
some
legs
and
flavors
are
potent
so
im
not
going
to
put
this
one
too
high
up
on
the
charts
i
like
this
beer
a
whole
lot
great
flavor
and
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
amount
of
alcohol
this
is
one
has
it
all

it
taste
the
same
with
the
hops
coming
1st
with
a
small
malt
backing
leaving
a
bitter
taste
overall
the
feel
is
bitter
medium
bodied
with
sharp
carbonation
a
long
aftertaste
with
some
earthy
things
abound
not
my
favorite
ipa
but
a
good
one
none
the
less
this
poured
clear
gold
with
white
head
it
smelled
like
lemon
hops
and
creamy
yeast
with
nutty
and
roasted
barley
malts
it
tasted
like
lemon
and
faint
peach
hops
with
nutty
malt
and
bready
yeast
it
was
watery
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
fairly
unimpressive
beer
it
seemed
more
like
a
belgian
blonde
ale
or
german
lager
due
to
all
the
malt
and
yeast
the
hops
were
pretty
weak
for
an
american
ipa
the
body
was
decent
and
it
hid
the
alcohol
well
so
it
was
easy
enough
to
drink
but
otherwise
this
wasnt
notable
or
worth
buying
again
this
is
an
excellent

loved
this

even
more
ontap
there
is
nothing
like
having
a
fresh

at
the

really
tasty
the
hops
were
lip
smacking
ok
for
the
price

certainly
nothing
to

a
clear

orange
with
a
thick
white

aroma
of
sweet
malt
some
wheat
maybe
light
tropical
fruits
and
light
hops
that
become
more
garlicky
as
the
beer
warms
flavor
is
more
hoppy
with
grassy
and
citrus
hops
nice
and
hoppy
although
the
dominating
hops
make
the
flavor
not
as
complex
as
some
of
the
top
ipas
still
a
solid
ipa
mouthfeel
was
a
scrubbing
texture
that
i
love
medium
bodied
this
one
was
a
pleasant
surprise
overall
a
good
ipa
from
gl
but
not
one
that
i
would
seek
out
that
often
as
it
does
not
distinguish
itself
from
the
many
other
ipas
out
there
i
had
heard
good
things
about
this
ale
and
was
excited
to
try
it
the
aroma
was
typical
of
an
american
ipa
with
a
floral
hoppiness
the
beer
was
a
nice
looking
golden
in
color
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
and
had
a
decent
body
i
found
the
taste
to
be
hoppy
with
a
mild
pine
component
but
otherwise
unremarkable
i
think
my
expectations
were
too
high
based
on
what
i
heard
this
is
a
rather
typical
ipa
drink
wanted
to
drink
this
all
night
but
it
was
my
1st
beer
and
then
i
had
the
monster
drinkability
fairly
drinkable
especially
if
you
go
for
sticky
ipas
md
this
stuff
is
great
a
good
almost
5050
balance
of
malts
and
hops
make
a
great
ipa
considering
the
80
ibus
i
could
drink
at
least
3
or
4
of
these
in
a
session
certainly
i
am
enjoying
the
mouthfeel
the
brewers
have
given
to
this
beer
enough
carbonation
to
kill
a
small
mammal
medium
bodied
with
a
slick
buttery
finish
12
ounces
drink
more
like
8
which
means
it
goes
down
easy
well
crafted
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
drinnkability
pretty
high
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
i
have
to
believe
its
great
for
a
hot
day
the
flavor
is
pleasant
and
strong
but
not
too
strong
and
the
balance
is
great
the
abv
is
pretty
doable
granted
its
a
little
on
the
higher
side
so
i
dont
know
about
drinking
it
in
a
session
but
if
the
daynight
is
long
enough
two
or
three
shouldnt
present
too
much
of
a
challenge
another
excellent
brew
from
glbc
notes
this
is
a
good
beer
for
8
99
and
would
recommend
it
not
my
favorite
glbc
beer
but
its
still
really
good
drink
it
cold
let
it
warm
it
tastes
good
in
different
ways
both
ways
d
a
very
very
welldone
ipa
from
great
lakes
not
a
west
coast
hop
bomb
but
its
a
topnotch
traditional
ipa
delicious
hop
flavors
pithy
bitterness
and
excellent
balance
i
remember
drinking
this
one
years
ago
at
the
great
lakes
brewery
up
in
cleveland
and
loving
it
i
am
so
glad
theyve
added
it
to
their
continuous
bottling
lineup
its
a
great
beer
a
moderate
level
of
alcohol
and
very
drinkable
for
a
night
of
drinking
id
go
with
their
burning
river
but
for
sitting
around
with
some
friends
or
to
pair
with
some
spicy
saag
paneer
this
one
hits
the
spot
mediumbodied
carbonation
is
on
the
low
side
nice
for
the
style
the
drinkability
is
hindered
by
the
lasting
taste
of
the
beer
not
really
my
cup
of
ale
future
outlook
great
lakes
rarely
disappoints
me
and
this
is
no
exception
another
excellent
offering
that
i
look
forward
to
having
this
again
made
for
a
very
happy
200th
review
to
me
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
mix
of
pale
carapils
and
bisquit
malts
as
well
as
a
wonderful
hop
nose
thats
bitter
but
balanced
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
really
smooth
pale
and
bisquit
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
bitter
with
some
great
hop
taste
there
is
incredible
balance
here
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
great
american
ipa
its
hoppy
yet
complex
enough
in
the
malt
bill
to
provide
a
level
of
balance
d
this
is
a
great
ipa
not
the
best
but
its
so
well
rounded
its
tasty
but
not
so
overwhelming
that
one
or
two
is
too
much
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
one
of
my
favorites
from
glbc
light
gold
colour
with
a
decent
head
for
such
a
strong
beer
it
has
a
sweet
fruity
nose
with
hints
of
apple
grape
raisin
and
peach
if
anything
it
tastes
a
little
too
sweet
but
there
is
a
good
herbal
edge
to
it
good
but
not
as
big
or
interesting
as
many
of
the
northwestern
ipas
d
i
dont
really
find
ipas
to
be
a
style
that
is
sessionable
to
me
but
this
is
one
i
could
see
myself
having
more
than
one
of
d
alright
drinkability
due
to
the
bitterness
i
have
had
no
problem
pounding
through
a
sixer
is
a
great
summertime
beer
d
fine
brew
that
has
all
of
the
key
ingredients
of
a
nice
ipa
not
the
best
but
solid
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
slick
slightly
oily
and
creamy
good
and
refreshing
for
an
ale
of
this
flavor
level
nice
quality
this
doesnt
really
enter
the
discussion
for
my
favorite
ipas
tastewise
but
its
incredible
solid
and
the
crafting
is
superb
its
gorgeous
and
id
buy
it
regularly
if
it
were
closer
good
drikability
im
sure
the
abv
would
get
me
after
awhile
but
the
first
bottle
goes
down
pretty
darn
easy
a
solid

d
it
was
an
alright
ipa
it
was
altogether
pretty
good
and
not
your
average
ipa
and
the
carmel
taste
makes
it
quite
unique
a
two
finger
light
tan
head
sits
on
top
of
a
slightly
hazy
orange
body
sweet
citrusy
hops
some
hints
of
tropical
fruits
in
the
aroma
the
taste
has
a
combination
of
tropical
fruits
grapefruit
peels
and
pine
tastes
really
good
but
the
drinkability
isnt
really
there
for
me
one
glass
and
im
done
with
it
for
the
night
d
quite
drinkable
im
glad
that
my
local
store
had
sixers
of
this
on
sale
for
only
6
49
i
havent
been
disappointed
by
a
great
lakes
brew
yet
easy
to
drink
tasty
ipa
others
i
would
choose
before
this
one
but
this
is
quite
tasty
as
i
poured
this
into
my
pint
glass
i
would
describe
the
color
as
a
light
orange
the
head
while
short
was
very
thick
and
left
a
nice
trail
of
lacing
throughout
the
entirety
of
its
short
existence
this
could
possibly
use
a
little
more
malt
falvoring
up
front
to
balance
the
wonderful
citrusy
hops
but
overall
the
taste
is
quite
good
goes
down
smooth
and
the
bitter
aftertaste
sticks
around
for
some
time
overall
another
fine
offering
from
great
lakes
poured
a
dark
amber
color
clear
appearance
nice
two
finger
head
and
brilliant
lacing
a
sweet
hop
smell
at
first
followed
by
a
grainy
alcohol
intake
gulp
yeah
this
one
is
on
the
sweeter
side
of
things
you
get
a
punch
of
the
hops
but
is
somewhat
tame
lightmedium
bodied
easy
gulper
though
the
high
abv
a
good
session
ipa
great
lakes
has
a
great
roster
of
beers
this
review
by
all
means
should
not
be
taken
to
heart
md
medium
bodied
with
a
light
chewiness
good
carbonation
and
very
easy
drinking
just
not
the
taste
profile
i
prefer
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
low
to
medium
carbonation
makes
this
beer
so
damn
drinkable
notes
im
guessing
something
went
wrong
this
is
not
a
great
lakes
beer
i
really
think
i
need
to
start
over
with
a
fresh
one
tastes
more
like
a
double
ipa
very
thick
caramel
flavors
coat
the
tongue
it
doesnt
taste
as
fresh
as
i
assumed
it
would
the
bottle
says
fresh
until
31109
the
citrus
shows
mostly
in
the
middle
of
the
sip
with
subdued
orange
lemon
and
banana
dry
hop
kick
on
the
end
that
really
shows
a
nice
use
of
pine
hops
some
booze
along
the
way
but
nothing
profound
or
displeasing
well
done
glb
great
lakes
commodore
perry
ipa
is
on
the
border
between
dark
gold
and
light
amber
its
crystal
clear
and
quite
sparkling
its
topped
with
a
dense
white
head
with
rainbow
bubbles
that
fades
to
a
film
and
leaves
good
lacing
it
has
a
nice
bold
citruspine
aroma
along
with
something
herbal
it
smells
a
little
sweet
like
christmas
cookies
despite
the
best
by
date
being
passed
it
smells
fresh
it
is
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
it
has
a
creamy
mouth
feel
thats
a
little
bubbly
it
lightens
up
toward
the
end
of
the
taste
it
has
a
pretty
dry
finish
that
leaves
the
mouth
a
little
sticky
its
pretty
well
bittered
and
pretty
well
balanced
i
suppose
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
bitterness
to
go
with
this
huge
boozy
quality
its
a
touch
sweet
the
flavor
is
mostly
grapefruit
and
pine
the
alcohol
lends
a
black
pepper
quality
drinkability
an
enjoyable
quality
india
pale
ale
charged
with
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
but
thankfully
refrains
from
being
overbearing
even
though
this
is
clearly
less
hoppy
than
most
american
ipas
i
really
enjoyed
this
very
drinkable
this
ones
a
keeper
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
orange
with
a
white
fizzy
head
that
dissiaptes
very
quickly
smells
like
carmel
maltgrassy
hops
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
thrown
in
very
easy
drinking
ipa
although
you
can
smell
the
alcohol
in
it
you
cannot
taste
it
mouthfeel
for
the
most
part
is
crisp
i
say
that
because
there
is
some
lingering
sweetness
overall
a
well
puttogether
ipa
that
needs
more
hop
snap
to
get
a
4
0
on
taste
from
me
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
pinch
of
carbonation
d
an
amazingly
easy
drinking
ipa
good
beer
with
so
many
good
ipas
out
there
the
competition
is
tuff
imo
this
stacks
up
somewhere
in
the
middle
i
recommend
it
as
you
cant
go
wrong
with
great
lakes
would
i
buy
more
of
it
i
really
wish
i
could
id
go
for
a
12pack
and
make
it
my
go
to
ipa
for
sure
i
like
this
beer
we
picked
up
a
fresh
case
while
in
oh
last
week
ill
be
sad
when
theyre
gone
next
time
i
gotta
stop
by
the
brewery
i
find
it
nicely
drinkable
and
do
enjoy
the
spicy
nature
a
solid
american
ipa
overall
a
really
enjoyable
beer
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
the
combination
of
the
bitter
hops
and
the
sweet
malts
make
this
a
pretty
nice
ipa
from
great
lakes
cheers
i
gotta
tell
you
i
am
loving
it
sweet
maltiness
makes
this
a
great
beer
drinkability
is
great
could
drink
these
all
night
until
my
body
rejects
d
this
is
a
tough
one
to
rate
tonight
i
dont
think
i
could
have
much
more
than
one
on
a
good
day
maybe
two
the
abv
catches
up
on
you
here
there
are
better
ipas
out
there
but
i
definitely
wont
have
a
problem
going
through
the
sixer
thats
for
sure
pours
golden
orange
with
very
little
head
smell
is
very
bright
with
grass
like
a
freshly
mowed
lawn
minus
the
lawnmower
exhaust
taste
is
a
hop
punch
in
the
front
a
little
of
that
grass
taste
is
there
then
mellows
to
a
sweet
malt
this
is
a
very
interesting
ipa
very
different
and
very
good
mouthfeel
is
of
lingering
bitter
hops
sweet
creamy
and
very
drinkable
a
delicious
ipa
d
this
just
wasnt
a
tremendously
well
done
ipa
it
lacked
a
big
hoppy
presence
and
was
instead
to
balanced
probably
wont
drink
again
pretty
drinkable
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangeamber
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
nice
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
oranges
grapefruit
and
hints
of
pine
however
all
these
aspects
seems
to
clash
with
each
other
the
taste
is
a
lot
like
the
aroma
but
not
quite
as
strong
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
ipa
that
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
i
would
try
it
again
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
do
so
another
great
brew
from
a
great
brewery
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
minimal
head
smell
is
slightly
hoppy
taste
is
bitter
hops
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
is
quickly
becoming
my
summer
staple
to
have
in
the
fridge
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
so
be
careful
with
these
the
feel
is
oily
and
thick
its
a
slow
sipper
to
be
sure
overally
its
very
heavy
and
loaded
with
a
massive
amount
of
hops
but
unfortunately
there
isnt
a
shred
of
malty
balance
definitely
not
a
typical
ipa
but
worth
a
try
ive
bought
this
several
times
and
plan
to
continue
buying
it
in
the
future
when
i
feel
like
a
different
ipa
thanks
rhinos00
for
the
opportunity
easy
drinking
ipa
especially
for
the
7
5
abv
not
the
best
ipa
i
have
had
but
not
bad
at
all
crisp
clean
and
hoppy
will
drink
it
again
but
will
not
crave
it
d
pucker
up
and
enjoy
this
beer
in
moderation
just
shy
of
one
finger
of
sticky
white
merengue
head
but
that
scant
foam
sticks
around
the
whole
12
ounces
leavningsome
lacing
after
each
sip
glass
clinging
bubbling
amidst
a
very
clear
coppery
amber
mojito
minty
hops
with
some
soft
mangos
and
bread
hit
the
nose
very
sticky
mint
and
citrus
hops
mix
with
some
powdered
malt
extract
or
the
toasted
kind
the
finish
is
very
oily
and
slick
bitter
graefruit
lingers
the
longest
overall
this
is
a
nice
ipa
with
a
nice
hop
profile
cheers
d
good
quality
ipa
very
drinkable
with
the
7
5
abv
well
masked
by
the
hops
flavors
smooth
and
refreshing
ipa
very
crisp
and
just
around
the
right
strength
to
make
this
very
drinkable
could
have
several
d
excellent
brew
exceeded
my
expectations
by
far
and
proved
great
lakes
as
a
phenom
brewer
one
of
my
new
favs
finally
an
ipa
that
isnt
hop
bombed
but
actually
shows
some
balance
an
excellent
depiction
id
recco
these
guys
to
anyone
and
will
make
it
a
point
to
get
more
of
their
offerings
d
this
is
a
nice
east
coast
ipa
and
at
7
5
is
headed
towards
dipa
status
my
last
of
the
great
lakes
regular
lineup
to
try
solid
but
i
prefer
most
of
the
lineup
over
this
one
im
finding
that
i
prefer
the
west
coast
ipa
style
over
the
east
coast
style
the
hoppy
flavor
overload
masks
the
bitterness
better
ill
probably
have
this
again
sometime
and
am
now
much
more
likely
to
buy
a
great
lakes
variety
case
d
good
not
great
and
i
expect
more
from
great
lakes
this
ipa
is
a
little
different
than
your
typical
facefull
of
pine
and
grapefruit
given
it
does
have
grapefruit
but
the
flavor
starts
mellow
and
then
grows
through
the
finish
to
a
big
spicy
bitterness
the
aroma
has
more
of
the
citrus
and
is
pleasant
but
relative
for
the
style
it
could
be
better
for
the
strength
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
a
little
dangerous
its
probably
a
good
thing
more
7
5
beers
arent
this
seemingly
sessionable
da
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
a
decent
ipa
overall
could
be
a
bit
hoppier
as
well
this
is
a
solid
ipa
from
great
lakes
and
the
alcohol
seems
well
hidden
at
7
5
but
i
would
expect
nothing
less
so
ive
tried
oktoberfest
from
this
brewery
and
thought
it
was
very
tasty
however
the
second
6er
we
got
was
this
and
let
me
tell
you
it
tastes
like
grapefruit
juice
gone
bad
mixed
with
alcohol
very
nasty
the
smell
was
nice
and
wasnt
expecting
to
be
blasted
by
nastiness
now
i
will
consider
trying
it
again
because
it
wont
be
the
first
time
i
tried
a
beer
for
the
first
time
and
hated
it
be
it
that
i
got
a
badold
batch
or
just
the
taste
buds
werent
up
to
it
the
date
on
these
bottles
were
112008
so
dont
know
what
happened
thanks
for
reading
d
i
could
drink
3
or
4
of
these
in
a
sitting
easily
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
take
down
a
6
pack
though
a
very
solid
interpretation
of
the
style
enough
hops
to
satisfy
this
hop
head
drinkability
decent
drinkability
the
bitter
hops
really
rule
this
beer
and
seem
to
hamper
drinkability
a
bit
not
my
favorite
ipa
but
a
solid
offering
from
great
lakes
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
this
is
dry
and
bitter
with
a
fair
amount
of
malt
this
isn
bad
but
it
isnt
the
best
product
by
great
lakes
but
the
abv
is
nice
and
this
is
a
smooth
drinking
brew
the
problem
is
that
it
jusd
dosent
stand
out
i
will
probley
only
drink
the
outher
five
that
i
have
and
forget
this
beer
totaly
avrage
surely
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
ipa
some
hopheads
that
are
expecting
a
hopbomb
will
be
dissapointed
nevertheless
i
would
recomend
this
beer
to
any
beer
geek
not
just
hopheads
d
pretty
solid
ipa
from
great
lakes
and
probably
my
favorite
offering
of
theirs
thus
far
its
got
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
in
the
flavor
thought
the
aroma
doesnt
reveal
the
full
extent
of
the
hops
in
this
brew
id
definitely
revisit
this
one
down
the
road
this
is
a
great
ipa
and
another
great
offering
from
great
lakes
although
i
cant
get
these
beers
on
a
regular
basis
i
look
for
them
whenever
i
can
find
them
best
wishes
to
great
lakes
on
their
20th
anniversary
heres
to
the
next
twenty
years
as
well
very
good
brew
i
am
not
a
big
ipa
fan
but
i
can
drink
this
very
easy
not
too
bitter
good
brew
i
would
drink
these
any
time
another
example
of
great
lakes
doing
what
they
do
best
making
terrific
beer
ive
been
hunting
for
this
seasonal
offering
and
was
able
to
track
some
down
this
is
right
in
line
with
the
great
lakes
way
of
brewing
beer
fantastic
recipe
and
a
great
angle
on
a
wonderful
style
emptied
a
bottle
into
my
glass
and
was
given
a
richly
golden
colored
ale
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
that
soon
settles
to
a
nice
white
film
abundant
lacing
is
present
and
a
lazy
carbonation
can
be
seen
as
i
smell
the
aroma
i
am
rewarded
with
a
biting
hop
scent
of
grapefruit
and
pine
this
is
pleasant
and
unexpected
and
it
smells
wonderful
this
is
considerably
more
citrusy
than
the
average
ipa
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
smooth
not
too
thick
so
it
goes
down
easy
the
flavor
is
outstanding
keeping
in
line
with
the
aroma
an
abundance
of
hops
cascade
is
an
understatement
fill
out
this
one
with
a
real
subtle
malt
backbone
taste
is
mostly
citrus
grapefruits
nice
and
tart
with
an
even
amount
of
bitterness
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
and
another
score
for
one
of
my
top
brewers
too
bad
its
seasonal
if
you
come
across
it
grab
some
d
alcohol
though
well
hidden
in
the
taste
makes
itself
very
present
later
on
as
you
are
a
ways
into
the
glass
pretty
thick
and
on
the
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
one
is
the
right
amount
of
one
of
these
for
a
night
its
been
a
while
since
a
gave
a
beer
all
4s
but
this
is
just
one
overall
balanced
good
beer
so
if
the
shoe
fits
all
4s
d
a
damn
good
ipa
i
have
become
a
huge
fan
of
great
lakes
beers
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
one
of
my
new
warm
weather
favorites
very
drinkable
i
can
see
myself
tipping
quite
a
few
of
these
back
in
a
sitting
poured
an
orange
amber
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
dissipated
quickly
leaving
behind
some
moderate
lacing
nice
floral
hop
notes
in
the
nose
backed
up
by
a
sweet
malt
character
very
sweet
for
an
ipa
which
i
must
admit
to
liking
lots
of
syrupy
hop
resins
on
the
tongue
some
great
malt
backbone
sweet
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
very
nice
brew
and
my
first
from
this
company
its
not
a
bad
effort
just
a
little
offpar
compared
to
the
ipas
which
are
more
widely
available
in
my
area
hv
for
an
ipa
this
one
doesnt
do
it
for
me
i
simply
needs
more
hops
i
had
this
recently
but
i
was
not
hoping
for
much
although
i
was
secretly
hoping
it
would
be
among
their
great
beers
but
its
not
not
enough
punch
hops
or
uniqueness
a
mainstream
beer
made
to
sell
in
stores
like
kroger
along
with
some
other
great
lakes
beers
nothing
compared
to
the
blackout
stout
and
some
other
seasonal
releases
prosit
mk
d
id
definitely
like
to
have
another
couple
of
these
a
great
year
round
pretty
commonly
available
selection
from
great
lakes
dwould
drink
a
few
more
but
would
start
to
look
for
something
new
solid
brew
d
not
impressed
i
would
give
a
fresh
bottle
another
go
clear
bronze
with
a
nice
off
white
head
leafy
and
pine
hops
along
with
some
pale
malt
aromas
nice
crisp
citrus
and
pine
hops
upfront
light
bisquity
malts
follow
thru
crisp
dry
slightly
floral
finish
with
ample
bitterness
this
cant
be
7
5
can
it
yes
its
all
there
with
this
puppy
another
fine
brew
from
great
lakes
drinkability
very
nice
and
affordable
around
these
parts
for
the
style
this
is
one
that
i
will
revisit
again
and
again
and
not
just
because
its
the
local
flavour
the
balance
makes
the
ale
quite
enjoyable
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
easy
to
enjoy
and
easy
on
the
tastebuds
so
the
mouthfeel
is
good
another
quality
beer
from
the
boys
in
cleveland
d
higher
abv
at
7
5
but
a
really
well
balanced
ipa
poured
a
clear
golden
amber
with
1
finger
of
creamy
white
head
nice
retention
and
sticky
lacing
smells
of
honey
grass
and
citrus
tastes
of
grass
honey
toasted
grain
and
grapes
with
an
earthy
hop
finish
with
a
touch
of
lemon
rind
tartness
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
good
balance
and
nice
bitterness
easy
to
drink
with
good
flavors
another
nice
brew
from
great
lakes
d
another
great
brew
from
great
lakes
that
i
would
definitely
recommend
a
nice
enough
beer
very
tasty
without
going
too
far
with
the
hops
d
easy
to
drink
with
great
balance
and
taste
i
would
like
to
know
the
ibus
on
this
one
oooh
found
out
its
80
this
is
a
hoppy
beer
also
has
a
nice
malty
backbone
to
counter
the
hops
lingering
bitterness
even
after
the
first
sip
a
bit
unbalanced
but
ipas
probably
should
be
nice
rocky
creamy
head
with
a
mess
of
lacing
down
the
glass
tart
and
bitter
grapefruit
flavors
singe
through
an
absolute
great
session
brew
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
it
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
with
a
lasting
white
head
it
smells
heavily
of
floral
and
citrus
hops
but
its
also
balanced
out
with
some
sweet
malt
this
is
a
really
solid
sessionable
ipa
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
the
malt
melds
really
well
with
the
strong
hoppiness
really
surprised
by
this
one
probably
my
second
favorite
from
great
lakes
so
far
next
to
the
blackout
stout
d
this
is
a
very
pleasant
ipa
well
balanced
and
enough
kick
to
make
it
a
joy
to
consume
the
label
bears
the
following
inscription
dont
give
up
the
sip
aye
aye
commodore
poured
a
medium
golden
copper
with
a
thick
head
that
stayed
around
awhile
it
smelled
uniquely
delightfulvery
flowery
tasted
very
hoppy
but
not
very
bitterfinished
smooth
and
was
very
drinkable
this
is
a
great
brew
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
definitely
recommend
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
minimal
carbonation
drinkability
is
average
the
nose
is
mostly
citrus
with
orange
peel
and
grapefruit
bitterness
mildly
chalky
docking
half
a
point
the
palate
is
an
explosion
of
citrus
hops
with
a
great
balance
between
flavor
and
bitterness
not
something
ive
found
in
too
many
east
coast
ipas
candied
orange
up
front
with
a
moderate
bitterness
mild
malt
presence
is
noted
with
a
caramel
character
with
a
simple
candy
sweetness
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
reserved
bitterness
good
carbonation
pleasing
finish
ml
in
body
solid
stuff
this
is
an
ipa
that
ipa
drinkers
will
like
there
is
a
nice
smell
to
this
beer
that
is
only
made
better
by
its
taste
its
crisp
and
hoppy
without
too
much
bite
there
is
a
hint
of
citrus
in
its
taste
the
after
taste
is
pleasant
another
very
good
great
lakes
brew
this
brewery
consistently
puts
out
incredible
brews
overall
not
bad
a
very
good
ipa
though
more
of
a
pale
ale
to
me
but
still
very
good
i
could
easily
see
myself
throwing
down
multiple
bottles
of
this
with
ease
really
a
good
call
and
something
everyone
should
try
this
will
be
a
staple
henceforth
from
a
fresh
sixer
this
is
a
clear
gold
with
a
really
nice
creamy
white
head
and
lacing
nose
is
somewhat
subdued
for
an
ipa
but
bready
sweet
honeyed
malts
and
floral
piney
notes
were
present
good
bouqet
but
id
just
like
it
amped
up
a
bit
at
this
abv
nice
malt
sweetness
and
big
bitter
hops
to
balance
sharp
hop
bitterness
lingers
just
over
medium
in
body
and
nice
carbonation
but
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
too
clean
possibly
missing
something
that
an
unfiltered
ale
brings
to
the
table
would
like
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
and
aroma
at
this
relatively
high
abv
a
light
orange
color
with
a
two
finger
head
the
head
was
an
off
white
color
a
hop
smell
which
i
like
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
is
excellent
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
the
mouth
feel
was
crisp
and
clean
this
is
a
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
and
will
be
a
regular
beer
that
i
purchase
i
have
to
rate
this
as
one
of
my
top
5
beers
of
any
style
pale
light
orange
pour
with
a
fluffy
white
head
smell
is
stale
like
light
hop
aroma
and
oxidation
tastes
oddly
sweet
mildly
hopped
and
of
alcohol
strange
flavors
obviously
not
as
fresh
as
it
should
be
as
is
quite
below
average
fire
a
very
enjoyable
ipa
with
some
unique
herbal
quality
bitterness
and
abv
can
become
tiresome
but
not
too
bad
big
thanks
john
i
love
a
good
ipa
and
this
more
than
qualifies
cheers
the
date
on
the
bottle
is
73007
but
it
still
tastes
great
the
hops
are
still
fairly
strong
and
all
the
qualities
of
an
ipa
are
there
a
nice
fluffy
head
formed
as
well
about
one
inch
the
dryness
is
pleasant
the
carbonation
is
low
the
fruitiness
and
bitterness
are
there
as
well
the
nose
is
noticeably
weak
but
im
sure
thats
because
its
past
date
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
fantastic
i
should
have
drank
this
a
long
time
ago
but
im
not
disappointed
with
the
quality
at
all
recommended
either
6
months
old
or
fresh
d
an
excellent
ipa
that
doesnt
let
the
hops
completely
rule
the
roost
like
most
american
ipas
do
good
malt
balance
and
a
very
brawny
body
that
while
making
it
a
pleasure
to
drink
keeps
me
from
reaching
for
more
than
one
pours
clear
copper
amber
with
a
very
sizeable
off
white
head
from
too
firm
a
pour
nose
is
basically
like
sticking
your
nose
in
a
can
of
pineapples
just
thick
pineapple
syrup
flavor
is
very
tangy
on
the
start
then
you
get
a
very
salty
hop
hit
with
slightly
vibrant
citrus
tones
feel
has
a
good
carbonation
to
it
and
the
liquid
is
even
drinkable
yes
even
though
it
leans
heavily
towards
the
salty
side
it
still
has
a
decent
leve
of
balance
that
keep
things
going
d
went
down
fast
enough
said
great
carbonation
and
the
mouthfeel
is
full
i
could
definatly
drink
a
few
of
these
not
my
favorite
in
style
i
tend
to
go
more
for
the
citrus
hop
flavors
but
this
is
a
great
beer
nontheless
there
is
a
strong
citrusorange
taste
and
a
sweet
aftertaste
good
beer
with
food
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
wheat
beer
youll
like
this
one
i
love
this
beer
just
a
great
ipa
it
is
readily
available
nearly
everywhere
in
columbus
including
most
chain
grocery
stores
and
has
saved
me
from
bmc
so
many
times
long
live
glbc
the
aroma
here
is
citrus
and
citrus
with
sweet
citrustangerine
oranges
very
fragrant
crsip
and
medium
bodied
typical
ipa
mouthfeel
this
is
one
ipa
that
leans
toward
the
sweet
side
of
things
interesting
when
it
is
colder
th
esweet
orange
notes
dominate
and
i
am
left
wishing
for
more
bitterness
to
balance
that
but
now
that
the
beer
has
warmed
i
am
left
with
lots
of
grapefruit
pith
bitterness
in
the
finish
certainly
a
serviceable
ipa
but
not
very
complex
my
how
spoiled
we
have
become
a
bit
too
sweet
beer
pours
out
a
nice
rich
golden
color
lively
carbonation
beer
gives
a
very
nice
1
head
with
excellent
lacing
all
the
way
down
smell
seemed
somewhat
faint
but
the
taste
had
a
nice
strong
hop
finish
mouthfeel
was
crisp
lively
with
the
carbonation
very
nice
ipa
id
like
to
try
this
one
again
if
i
couldmaybe
the
next
time
that
i
am
in
the
area
ill
try
this
ohio
beer
as
i
tend
to
like
this
style
great
lakes
usually
makes
some
good
brews
d
this
goes
down
way
too
easy
given
the
alcohol
level
a
very
dangerous
beer
an
excellent
example
of
a
hoppy
yet
well
balanced
ipa
still
one
of
my
favorites
i
need
to
pick
this
up
more
often
highly
recommended
clear
orange
amber
color
with
adequate
head
modest
lacing
aroma
of
citrus
taste
is
a
very
nice
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
citrus
hops
finishes
dry
and
clean
with
little
aftertase
feels
good
in
the
mouth
and
is
eminently
drinkable
this
could
become
my
evreyday
beer
d
nice
hoppiness
but
could
use
more
balance
towards
the
malty
side
of
things
d
this
beer
has
a
huge
hop
bitterness
that
overpowers
the
hops
aroma
and
flavor
there
is
some
nice
support
by
the
malt
but
the
hops
are
just
a
bit
too
pungent
i
really
like
hops
but
there
is
just
something
about
this
beer
that
a
dont
care
for
in
the
hops
nicely
done
just
not
my
style
lacking
a
bit
of
balance
but
i
am
assuming
that
is
what
they
intended
hopheads
should
be
pleased
this
poured
with
a
fluffy
offwhitelighttan
head
with
decent
retention
the
nose
was
slightly
hoppy
but
overlain
with
an
alcohol
sharpness
the
color
was
a
bright
deepyellow
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
light
hoppiness
on
the
palate
the
finish
was
distinctly
hoppy
somewhat
citrusy
like
grapefruit
it
masked
its
7
5
abv
well
i
like
this
beer
quite
well
its
one
of
the
better
ipas
that
i
have
had
this
one
is
worth
having
the
commodore
pours
a
clear
copper
in
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
exhibits
notes
of
biscuit
caramel
piney
hops
with
a
fruitiness
to
it
fullbodied
mouthfeel
thats
crisp
around
the
edges
flavor
has
a
thick
malty
backbone
to
it
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
middle
hops
combine
both
a
piney
and
citrusy
flavor
that
transitions
into
an
ale
fruitiness
very
juicy
and
mouthwatering
the
7
5
alcohol
is
hardly
noticeable
on
the
flavor
nicely
done
its
a
great
beer
just
with
a
7
5abv
and
a
strong
hop
character
it
gets
a
little
grating
for
me
personally
with
a
full
awareness
that
others
will
most
certainly
disagree
and
thats
ok
were
all
different
but
this
brew
lets
me
peek
into
your
world
for
a
minute
hophead
and
i
could
enjoy
about
3
pints
of
this
bad
boy
and
be
well
satisfied
a
light
golden
to
copper
color
with
an
eighth
of
an
inch
white
forming
that
head
dissolves
away
quickly
though
the
strong
fragrance
of
citrus
hits
the
nose
at
first
scent
followed
bytouches
of
pine
and
earthy
fragrances
the
aroma
ends
with
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
to
even
it
out
the
taste
has
the
malt
coming
out
at
the
start
and
it
continues
till
midway
then
an
intense
grapefruit
flavor
strikes
the
palate
surprisingly
it
leaves
a
salty
aftertaste
following
ever
sip
a
medium
bodied
feel
that
stays
that
way
all
the
way
through
it
does
have
a
slight
tingle
from
the
carbonation
but
takes
nothing
away
a
well
balanced
ipa
with
unique
strength
of
bitterness
this
is
a
hop
lovers
everyday
beer
medium
body
nicely
carbonated
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
really
warm
for
an
ipa
but
im
not
complaining
ill
enjoy
the
rest
of
this
sixer
poured
a
bright
orange
color
with
some
murkiness
head
was
a
nice
creamy
white
color
with
great
retention
but
did
not
leave
a
great
deal
of
lacing
smell
was
a
little
lacking
but
toward
the
end
of
the
session
i
was
able
to
pick
out
some
floral
aroma
taste
is
mostly
citrus
and
delicious
somewhat
of
a
watery
oily
mouthfeeling
i
was
actually
able
to
taste
more
from
the
bottle
than
on
tap
bottle
poured
an
orangey
color
ale
with
a
big
foamy
head
with
some
good
retention
but
low
lacing
aroma
of
bitter
hops
with
no
discernable
citrus
notes
of
floral
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
bitter
hops
with
a
dry
finish
and
some
weak
caramel
malt
body
is
about
average
with
some
good
carbonation
slightly
below
the
standard
for
the
style
and
not
the
best
from
this
great
brewery
d
alcohol
is
hidden
nicely
in
the
taste
but
this
drinks
dangerously
easy
for
7
5
if
i
had
more
id
have
another
mediumfull
with
medium
carbonation
a
rich
sticky
feel
but
not
too
overwhelming
it
still
manages
to
be
refreshing
d
the
alcohol
doesnt
rear
its
head
at
all
aiding
the
drinkability
that
abv
is
reasonably
high
though
so
a
few
bottles
will
do
you
in
nice
hop
body
though
especially
for
an
ipa
clear
and
dark
gold
the
beer
was
capped
by
a
fluffy
white
head
that
settled
quickly
to
a
thin
cap
leaving
behind
some
delicate
transient
lace
floral
aroma
with
mild
citrus
and
fruit
notes
just
a
hint
of
toasty
sweet
malts
as
well
strong
bitterness
up
front
became
pine
resin
towards
the
finish
solid
caramel
maltiness
with
some
sweetness
that
lessens
at
the
end
hope
were
sometimes
grassy
mostly
pine
and
floral
bitterness
really
lingered
alcohol
flavour
was
faint
and
gave
it
a
bit
of
spiciness
warmth
was
pleasant
medium
bodied
with
fine
carbonation
and
chewy
malt
pretty
good
stuff
the
use
of
hops
was
a
little
different
than
a
lot
of
other
ipas
and
the
balance
was
quite
good
for
the
bitterness
level
drinkability
a
little
too
brash
for
my
everyday
needs
but
certainly
on
the
short
list
when
a
stiff
ipa
is
in
order
this
is
a
very
very
drinkable
ipa
surprising
considering
the
high
abv
i
think
this
beer
is
unique
tasting
it
is
very
complex
to
me
it
has
a
sweet
fruity
pineapplelike
quality
on
the
swallow
then
finishes
with
an
earthy
bitter
dryness
maybe
a
little
too
bitter
for
some
its
very
strange
and
im
loving
every
minute
of
it
the
higher
abv
is
buzzing
my
senses
but
the
smooth
almost
oily
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
makes
me
keep
going
for
more
the
appearence
is
crystal
clear
golden
amber
with
a
lively
head
that
retains
well
smell
is
subtle
but
complex
a
real
winner
here
in
my
book
will
happily
purchase
again
pours
out
a
crystal
clear
golden
orange
with
about
a
finger
of
white
head
nice
lacing
its
always
pleasant
to
have
an
ipa
after
a
long
while
without
the
aroma
is
so
enjoyable
in
its
floral
hoppiness
as
it
is
in
this
one
the
flavor
is
ipaish
for
certain
it
starts
off
tasting
like
flowers
if
that
makes
sense
and
the
powerful
hops
set
in
quickly
the
aftertaste
lingers
quite
a
bit
as
well
overall
its
good
but
not
great
as
the
bitterness
is
almost
too
much
on
the
other
hand
its
really
smooth
in
the
mouth
impressively
so
i
can
drink
it
easily
enough
not
bad
but
there
are
better
ipas
pours
a
clean
golden
orange
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
to
follow
the
nose
is
hoppy
some
malt
tones
and
caramel
the
taste
is
hoppy
and
malty
lots
of
caramel
this
brew
is
nice
but
just
not
hoppy
enough
to
be
a
good
ipa
but
still
is
tasty
medium
body
drinkable
a
nice
brew
but
to
much
on
the
malty
side
at
seven
some
odd
percent
this
is
an
incredibly
quaffable
ipa
it
is
quenching
and
full
of
a
modest
but
assertive
character
great
lakes
brewing
offer
products
of
great
quality
this
is
no
exception
a
great
textbook
offering
of
the
ipa
style
i
enjoyed
this
on
its
own
as
a
nice
after
dinner
tipple
thanks
to
kingpin
for
the
bottle
this
pours
a
clear
pale
amber
color
with
a
fine
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
and
leaves
a
small
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
citrussy
hops
the
taste
is
hoppy
with
a
grapefruit
flavor
predominating
as
well
a
a
good
fruity
malt
backingapricot
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
ipa
with
a
rich
and
smooth
mouthfeel
according
to
the
label
the
alcohol
content
is
7
5
which
is
higher
than
i
would
expect
from
the
taste
this
is
a
very
drinkeable
ipa
tempered
only
by
the
high
abv
this
is
by
no
means
a
hop
monster
just
a
nice
wellbalanced
ipa
i
recommend
this
beer
for
just
about
anybody
who
is
not
afraid
of
flavor
and
wants
a
refreshing
drink
overall
an
interesting
and
unique
take
on
the
ipa
style
malty
but
not
in
an
english
ipa
sort
of
way
it
adds
dimension
without
taking
away
from
the
tongue
ripping
character
of
the
american
style
another
solid
winner
by
the
folks
from
ohio
d
a
great
ipa
hides
the
7
5
alcohol
exceptionally
well
orangy
gold
with
a
big
white
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lace
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
bottle
i
could
smell
bready
yeast
and
sweet
sweet
hoppy
goodness
nose
is
piney
grapefruit
malty
and
yeast
i
love
the
bready
yeast
character
this
one
has
too
often
the
ipas
are
overwhelmed
by
the
hoppiness
taste
is
mostly
grapefruit
with
some
pine
malt
and
yeast
just
a
little
bitter
as
well
full
medium
body
with
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
pleasure
to
drink
and
a
great
gift
from
a
friend
who
took
a
trip
to
the
midwest
cheers
to
comrades
who
share
the
love
not
a
lot
to
say
about
this
beer
but
if
you
are
looking
for
an
american
ipa
on
the
hoppy
side
you
should
be
happy
with
this
beer
d
as
with
most
ipas
the
strength
and
boldness
keeps
this
from
being
a
session
beer
but
i
would
never
turn
down
one
or
two
or
three
d
very
good
well
balanced
not
very
heavy
for
such
a
strong
beer
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
could
definately
have
2
or
3
this
is
a
nice
ipa
overall
would
be
interested
to
try
it
with
a
little
less
abv
as
it
seems
in
my
humble
opinion
to
add
a
bit
too
much
sweetness
to
it
anyway
ive
had
several
offerings
from
this
brewery
and
cant
say
that
this
one
is
one
of
my
favorites
but
its
certainly
decent
to
say
the
least
esp
as
it
progresses
it
is
a
tough
style
to
contend
with
with
all
of
the
competition
its
nice
but
well
mellow
other
than
abv
the
alcohol
is
not
particularly
noticeable
for
its
abv
and
i
would
drink
two
or
three
last
swigs
citrusy
grapefruit
sraight
up
american
ipa
some
ipas
might
offer
a
broader
palate
but
as
a
focused
bright
leafy
dry
ipa
kudos
to
this
one
finishes
clean
after
a
crisp
dryness
medium
bodied
and
very
tasty
another
great
one
from
a
great
brewery
pours
two
fingers
of
foamy
head
over
a
light
amber
orangecopper
crystal
clear
beer
looks
exactly
how
an
ipa
should
even
leaving
solid
lacing
as
it
downs
nose
is
fairly
mild
mostly
just
floral
hops
and
a
touch
of
very
light
malt
character
great
flavor
in
no
particular
order
a
long
fruity
hoppy
aftertaste
grapefruit
oranges
peaches
and
light
sweet
caramel
malt
the
beer
sweetens
as
it
warms
which
makes
for
a
perfect
balance
to
the
bitterness
this
ones
a
superhoppy
ipa
with
a
great
fruit
character
a
really
solid
ipa
drinkability
awesome
great
hop
bitterness
would
stand
up
to
some
spicy
asian
food
or
raw
fish
worth
seeking
out
at
least
for
a
try
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
with
a
decent
head
that
is
slow
to
diminish
the
aroma
is
of
great
citrus
hops
with
some
sweet
malts
behind
them
the
taste
is
a
great
hop
balance
that
somewhat
overpowers
the
malt
backbone
great
for
a
hophead
like
me
the
beer
is
rather
crisp
with
well
hidden
alcohol
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
ipa
pours
a
clear
amber
decent
one
finger
white
head
dropped
a
lot
of
lacing
settles
to
a
nice
layer
and
ring
good
retention
smell
is
sweet
caramel
piney
hops
some
floral
fruity
alcohol
not
very
fragrant
but
the
aroma
thats
there
is
quite
nice
taste
is
very
malty
sweet
a
bit
sugary
almost
cloying
spicy
bitterness
pine
alcohol
fruits
almost
has
a
belgian
feel
to
it
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
very
thick
with
low
carbonation
alcohol
is
well
hidden
found
this
hard
to
drink
something
about
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
feel
right
to
me
just
thick
and
heavy
without
a
lot
of
flavour
to
fill
it
out
drinkability
strong
beer
so
just
one
a
night
will
do
goes
down
nice
though
but
there
ipa
is
nothing
special
oh
well
nightynite
pours
a
soft
copper
color
with
a
quickly
disappearing
head
a
lot
of
lacing
a
very
flowery
smell
with
some
hops
to
it
and
citrus
very
smooth
taste
with
hints
of
malt
and
not
too
overwhelming
hops
to
it
avery
nice
and
smooth
ipa
very
drinakble
and
refreshing
and
not
too
harsh
poured
from
a
12
oz
brown
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
thin
head
heavy
lacing
and
a
relatively
nondistinct
aroma
the
taste
however
is
quite
distinct
featuring
a
medium
to
high
hoppiness
with
a
strong
fruit
and
floral
overtone
that
when
coupled
with
the
moderate
carbonation
makes
for
a
very
refreshing
summer
beer
often
i
find
ipas
dry
me
out
a
bit
after
a
couple
but
the
crispness
of
the
beer
and
fruit
and
floral
tones
really
balances
out
the
hops
and
makes
it
easy
to
drink
a
really
great
ipa
medicinal
mouthfeel
otherwise
like
an
ipa
should
be
4
just
not
superdrinkable
i
cant
get
over
the
superhigh
abv
of
this
beer
and
it
just
punished
me
when
it
was
regularly
5
99
or
6
99
overall
a
pretty
decent
ipa
i
could
see
myself
buying
a
6er
of
this
at
a
reasonable
price
though
i
paid
3
or
3
50
for
a
single
12
oz
bottle
it
wasnt
that
good
overall
recommended
i
got
this
bottle
at
lone
hill
and
it
may
have
been
a
little
old
at
the
time
so
the
hops
seem
to
have
faded
a
bit
still
tasty
but
would
like
to
have
it
fresh
taste
medium
to
light
bodied
although
it
did
show
some
cookie
crispness
the
hop
bite
is
a
bit
harsh
with
a
bone
dry
finish
that
sort
of
throws
off
the
balance
somewhat
i
tend
to
like
my
ipas
a
bit
more
malty
it
did
eventually
grow
on
me
as
the
hoppy
flavors
saturated
my
tastebuds
and
the
acridness
of
the
aftertaste
slowly
diminished
i
wouldnt
drive
100
miles
for
this
beer
but
i
wouldnt
mind
if
my
local
pub
had
it
pours
a
moderately
dark
orangecopper
color
with
a
decent
head
with
decent
retention
and
some
lacing
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
aroma
hits
you
fairly
quickly
which
smells
of
fairly
strong
alcohol
and
a
nice
citrus
finish
has
a
very
fruity
grapefruit
taste
and
is
very
bitter
very
hoppy
has
a
moderate
mouthfeel
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
beer
one
of
my
favorite
american
ipas
i
thoroughly
enjoy
this
beer
not
only
for
the
fact
that
its
available
in
many
places
in
my
area
gotta
love
the
12packs
but
being
a
hop
head
commodore
perry
always
hits
the
spot
its
a
smooth
and
bold
ipa
and
i
admit
the
high
alcohol
level
is
also
nice
ever
since
glbc
made
this
a
year
round
brew
there
is
always
a
six
pack
in
my
fridge
keep
up
the
good
work
cleveland
and
go
bengals
very
drinkable
because
it
is
so
dry
you
taste
no
alcohol
so
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
label
to
know
its
8
percent
pours
an
insanely
clear
apple
juice
color
quite
the
shock
one
finger
fluffy
white
head
dies
down
to
a
thin
lacing
stickiness
is
alright
spotty
on
the
sides
first
thing
i
get
from
the
smell
is
a
caramel
malt
am
i
crazy
after
that
first
scent
big
citrus
notes
of
mostly
grapefruit
dominate
the
nose
a
tiny
bit
of
honey
presents
itself
as
well
taste
is
pretty
complex
starts
off
somewhat
bready
from
the
good
malt
background
and
then
is
dominated
by
a
lemony
hop
kick
that
honey
flavor
once
again
surfaces
but
this
time
on
the
tongue
ends
up
semidry
with
an
earthy
fruit
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
scary
good
i
really
enjoy
this
ipa
i
think
the
finish
is
the
best
part
of
this
brew
dont
judge
a
beer
by
how
it
looks
thats
all
i
have
to
say
this
glbc
offering
pours
a
clear
orange
copper
with
a
nice
dense
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
smell
is
a
balance
of
malt
and
fruity
hops
taste
is
again
somewhat
balanced
the
malt
tenders
the
hoppiness
the
fruitiness
is
clearer
here
and
seems
to
be
green
apple
like
some
bitter
grapefruit
as
well
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
but
the
hops
leave
the
palate
clean
i
found
this
to
be
a
drinkable
ipa
and
another
fine
glbc
brew

drinkability
youve
got
to
want
this
beer
style
or
get
into
it
fast
to
truly
enjoy
this
beer
drinkability
quite
smooth
despite
the
complexity
and
strength
watch
out
for
ths
one
d
7
5
alcohol
thats
all
i
have
to
say
about
that
so
if
you
want
a
session
you
probably
should
be
a
seasoned
drinker
a
nice
ipa
but
at
least
a
tier
below
headhunter
or
white
rajah
our
other
year
round
locals
d
very
good
tasty
easy
goin
down
a
beer
id
drive
2535
miles
to
lone
hill
or
walnut
for
but
since
there
are
local
ipas
in
ca
that
are
just
as
good
i
feel
lucky
but
if
im
ever
in
the
midwest
a
definite
retasting
is
in
order
a
very
solid
effort
from
great
lakes
actually
im
reaching
the
end
of
this
its
just
so
good
im
going
to
have
to
give
it
a
5
for
drinkability
very
nice
ipa
all
around
poured
a
nice
copperamber
color
with
a
long
lasting
3
finger
head
a
very
pleasing
aroma
of
hops
dominated
cascade
fuggles
this
is
by
no
means
a
one
dimensional
ale
a
solid
malt
base
provides
a
complex
mixture
of
bready
malts
to
a
dominate
yet
pleasing
hop
bitterness
the
finish
was
clean
and
dry
at
over
7
abv
this
is
an
ale
to
sip
drinkability
very
drinkable
just
mind
the
alcohol
content
d
easy
drinking
i
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
however
it
doesnt
really
do
anything
to
set
itself
apart
from
other
ipas
i
would
drink
it
again
but
not
really
seek
it
out
the
high
abv
means
i
wouldnt
be
drinking
a
lot
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
the
clean
finish
on
this
ipa
tempts
me
to
try
taste
is
full
of
sweet
bitter
notes
emphasizing
the
hops
and
citrus
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
juicy
with
a
light
body
and
a
carbonation
level
to
match
great
lingering
bitterness
on
this
puppy
really
enjoyed
the
aftertaste
the
commodore
drinks
well
but
is
perhaps
a
bit
too
onesided
to
be
a
truly
outstanding
ipa
im
looking
forward
to
trying
the
other
beer
styles
from
the
cleveland
crew
great
lakes
brewing
is
a
favorite
of
mine
and
always
has
been
yum
the
taste
though
is
very
ipaish
high
bitterness
comes
accross
first
from
the
hops
this
is
definitley
more
of
an
earthy
hop
pine
and
grass
bitterness
lingers
quite
a
bit
the
taste
isnt
too
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
carbonation
is
right
on
and
its
a
light
ipa
in
the
mouth
the
drinkability
though
is
a
little
boring
to
me
so
while
i
would
get
this
beer
again
at
some
point
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
all
the
time
d
an
above
average
ipa
look
for
this
and
give
it
a
try
i
would
come
back
without
reservation
pours
a
nice
golden
one
finger
white
headwith
some
retentionand
a
nice
lace
smell
is
of
tart
fruit
and
alchol
body
is
mediumwith
carbionation
taste
is
graprfruit
up
front
with
a
bitter
hoppy
finish
bit
of
an
after
taste
dropped
the
taste
rating
for
mebut
still
a
great
brew
drinkability
is
good
here
when
i
uncapped
this
little
12oz
bottle
my
expectations
was
well
this
will
be
an
alright
ipa
the
beer
poured
like
a
golden
elixir
into
my
glass
the
look
is
quite
exceptional
very
clear
and
the
color
of
a
golden
ale
if
you
all
remembered
those
old
novelty
items
where
it
would
like
beer
was
being
poured
into
a
glass
by
a
spigot
well
thats
the
way
this
looks
the
smell
reminds
me
of
a
little
avery
maharaja
quite
fruity
taste
is
very
good
it
again
reminds
me
of
the
avery
maharaja
drinkability
is
good
because
a
hint
of
alcohol
comes
through
however
the
bitterness
pretty
much
masks
the
alcohol
content
pours
a
mostly
clear
honey
amber
body
with
a
one
finger
vanilla
head
decent
retention
and
good
patch
lacing
aroma
is
citrusy
hops
with
a
note
of
grassiness
caramel
and
bready
malt
scents
underneath
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
zippy
carbonation
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
on
the
tongue
taste
is
ruled
by
a
grapefruit
hops
bitterness
that
has
just
enough
of
a
sweet
malt
spine
to
balance
a
citrusy
note
of
tangerine
and
some
cut
hay
round
out
the
finish
nice
complexity
and
hops
crispness
an
excellent
american
ipa
here
cant
believe
i
waited
so
long
to
discover
this
a
clean
and
crisp
mouthfeel
is
a
result
of
some
tight
carbonation
and
a
refreshing
smoothness
in
the
finish
i
try
not
to
be
bias
since
i
am
such
a
fan
of
the
brewery
but
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
not
the
overall
best
from
great
lakes
by
any
means
but
really
quality
beer
nontheless
overallthis
is
a
really
nice
ipa
a
fairly
representative
example
of
a
quality
midwest
ipa
however
it
is
big
at
8
and
has
quailities
of
dipa
with
the
level
of
hop
and
malt
presence
d
it
seems
to
me
that
great
lakes
has
tweaked
the
recipe
for
this
years
batch
compared
to
last
summers
trial
i
was
not
a
fan
of
last
seasons
effort
as
it
was
overly
bitter
and
lacked
balance
but
this
years
commadore
perry
has
made
me
a
fan
i
will
seek
out
this
offing
again
recommeded
drinkability
wow
8
abv
well
hidden
i
was
thinking
that
this
might
be
a
refreshing
session
beer
guess
it
might
be
a
short
but
refreshing
session
anyway
a
good
drinker
takes
me
back
to
plebe
year
history
of
sea
power
overall
this
is
much
better
than
previous
batches
of
this
beer
that
ive
tried
in
fact
it
was
so
good
that
i
wonder
if
theres
some
merit
to
the
rumors
that
great
lakes
quality
control
has
suffered
as
of
late
as
far
as
this
one
is
concerned
though
it
represents
the
brewery
proudly
d
a
very
fine
ipa
it
is
so
hoppy
it
almost
seems
like
a
dipa
not
in
the
same
class
as
bear
racer
5
celebration
ale
hop
otten
stone
and
smuttynose
but
still
a
solid
ipa
a
very
good
ipa
indeed
if
this
does
replace
burning
river
as
ive
heard
in
the
forum
i
truely
enjoyed
thisone
more
oh
yeah
this
is
a
strong
ipa
that
i
could
drink
all
night
except
the
alcohol
level
would
put
a
stop
to
it
a
bit
early
a
very
recommended
ale
drinkability
is
good
balanced
fairly
well
a
bit
overly
fruity
but
still
nice
a
solid
ipa
leaning
slightly
toward
the
english
style
in
terms
of
malt
presence
but
more
than
enough
hops
depth
to
remain
in
the
american
branch
a
bit
of
toffee
in
the
malt
quickly
overshadowed
by
a
blunt
hops
bittering
finish
is
smooth
and
even
the
abv
is
well
integrated
in
the
flavor
profile
its
been
a
few
months
since
ive
tasted
a
hop
wallop
but
for
some
reason
this
beer
is
similiar
more
toned
down
but
similiar
anything
similiar
to
hop
wallop
is
an
ipa
i
would
drink
any
day
of
the
week
another
great
beer
from
great
lakes
d
practically
a
double
ipa
and
some
my
find
the
bitterness
a
little
harsh
i
cant
say
id
recommend
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
half
finger
head
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
malts
and
nice
grapefruit
hops
taste
is
brown
sugary
malts
up
front
with
citrus
and
pine
hops
cleaning
off
the
palate
creamy
mouthfeel
but
not
chewy
excellent
ipa
wow
i
never
thought
the
day
would
come
where
i
could
pick
up
a
sixer
of
a
great
lakes
ipa
right
in
the
ohio
valley
recently
the
microbrews
have
come
into
the
steubenvillewintersville
oh
areas
in
specifically
the
two
kroger
grocery
stores
with
great
lakes
products
came
erie
brewing
magic
hat
atwater
and
more
im
happy
to
see
this
happening
heres
the
ipa
and
the
bottle
states
7

abv
when
i
visited
the
brewery
back
in
04
it
was
listed
at
8
appearance
has
a
light
bronze
copper
appearance
even
a
pale
peach
lighter
in
color
than
the
burning
river
pale
large
off
white
creamy
textured
head
forms
thick
and
dwindles
slow
clinging
to
the
edges
of
the
pint
leaving
even
rings
of
lace
with
each
sip
aromatics
contains
heavy
grapefruit
peel
action
with
a
sugary
coating
much
sweeter
smelling
than
actual
grapefruit
the
malts
used
here
are
mildly
toasted
with
somewhat
of
a
spicy
rye
note
even
though
i
now
none
of
that
was
utilized
here
flavors
a
bitey
somewhat
acidic
wave
of
high
alpha
hops
grapefruit
peels
pine
and
grassy
components
all
dive
onto
the
palate
with
some
initial
sweetness
quickly
gets
wiped
away
not
as
diverse
and
well
balanced
as
some
standard
ipas
but
at
7
5
this
one
is
on
the
border
of
a
dipa
definitely
some
assertive
alcohol
noted
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
light
slippery
textured
hop
oils
gliding
on
the
palate
definitely
sticks
to
the
tongue
and
carbonation
feels
natural
and
carris
the
brew
well
pretty
moderate
drinkability
is
great
i
could
handle
a
few
of
these
but
really
ive
been
enjoying
one
out
of
the
sixer
at
a
time
spreading
them
out
has
been
an
enjoyable
experience
between
finishing
nursing
school
this
week
and
catching
up
on
cutting
the
grass
this
brew
is
substantial
enough
to
fill
my
hophead
cravings
i
believe
in
my
last
review
on
tap
i
yearned
for
this
beer
to
be
bottled
well
i
guess
i
owe
a
thank
you
to
the
folks
at
great
lakes
goo
job
guys
way
to
go
on
this
one
gl
at
8
this
is
a
very
big
ipa
and
that
plus
the
lingering
bitterness
takes
a
bit
away
from
the
drinkability
overall
very
good
solid
ipa
and
another
fine
offering
from
gl
poured
out
a
light
yellow
gold
color
crowned
by
a
thin
just
off
white
head
the
nose
is
sweet
pink
grapefruit
pith
backed
by
slight
amount
of
hops
the
taste
was
both
malt
sweet
and
hoppy
bitter
along
with
some
slight
sour
citrus
notes
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
was
a
very
drinkable
and
fairly
enjoyable
beer
overall
a
good
ipa
with
a
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
more
in
line
with
a
double
ipa
i
liked
it
lightmedium
body
a
very
refreshing
beautiful
beer
this
very
decent
ipa
has
a
clear
amber
hue
with
a
massive
foamy
head
the
lace
clings
heavily
to
the
last
sip
very
appealing
hoppy
aroma
cream
notes
when
swirled
commodore
perry
has
a
wellbalanced
hoppiness
that
is
not
as
bitter
as
it
is
sweet
grapefruity
bite
finishes
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
with
a
delciously
syrupy
texture
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
ipa
but
with
such
high
abv
only
a
few
glasses
will
be
manageable
in
a
short
time
span
however
its
tastiness
can
make
it
difficult
to
sip
it
pairs
well
with
a
creamy
goat
cheese
the
sweetness
of
the
beers
grapefruit
notes
plays
well
against
the
sour
creaminess
of
the
cheese
an
above
average
beer
for
the
style
this
is
a
well
done
ipa
but
thats
it
there
are
warmer
ipas
with
more
flavors
other
than
up
front
hops
and
there
are
hop
bombs
that
manage
to
do
all
that
bitter
with
a
temprement
this
split
the
middle
and
did
not
impress
very
well
done
a
top
notch
ipa
grab
it
while
you
can
if
you
close
i
may
have
to
go
back
tomorrow
and
buy
the
last
3
sixers
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
just
not
that
notable
glbc
missed
the
mark
a
bit
on
this
one
but
its
still
worth
a
try
d
i
wasnt
blown
away
i
was
excited
about
an
ipa
from
great
lakes
but
this
just
doesnt
seem
like
its
ready
to
sit
at
the
table
with
the
adults
yet
reminded
me
of
hop
wallop
dialed
down
a
notch
or
two
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
to
medium
bodied
its
easy
to
drink
considering
the
7
5
abv
it
will
definitely
sneak
up
on
you
you
really
cant
tell
its
that
strong
overall
its
okay
im
a
big
fan
of
great
lakes
and
i
think
this
is
a
step
down
from
their
usual
offerings
worth
a
try
but
far
from
spectacular
if
this
makes
any
sense
it
has
xy
z
but
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
of
w
in
there
as
well
glbc
know
their
stuff
but
this
could
use
just
a
pinch
more
of
something
yet
you
wont
go
wrong
with
this
one
all
i
know
is
this
stuff
kicks
ass
cheers
i
am
very
happy
this
is
now
a
regular
beer
this
ipa
is
a
bright
clear
light
amber
color
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
the
aromas
of
floral
hops
are
very
apparent
and
very
slight
background
of
sweet
grapefruit
hops
there
is
a
slight
oaky
aroma
as
it
warms
also
the
background
of
alcohol
comes
out
as
well
the
bitter
toasty
piney
grapefruit
hops
slight
toasty
malt
flavor
not
balanced
but
it
is
very
good
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
loads
of
bitterness
and
really
dry
this
is
definitely
one
easy
to
drink
ipa
poured
a
clear
honey
amber
with
a
small
skim
of
white
bubbles
that
i
guess
is
suppose
to
act
as
commodore
perrys
head
of
foam
when
the
head
of
foam
fizzled
away
it
left
behind
some
white
bubbles
as
rings
and
maybe
a
few
bubbles
acting
as
lace
the
beers
appearance
is
made
mostly
of
just
bubbles
floating
around
aimlessly
it
smells
like
great
lakes
took
a
giant
grapefruit
and
then
dipped
it
in
candy
sugar
then
they
combined
the
sugar
coated
grapefruit
with
citrus
hops
once
the
beer
really
warms
up
it
smells
like
cold
cereal
without
the
milk
unusual
but
good
ill
give
that
now
this
is
where
you
get
to
taste
the
sugar
coated
grapefruit
combined
with
the
citrus
hops
after
the
citrus
hops
have
gone
a
slight
taste
of
toasted
malt
emerges
i
believe
the
toasted
malts
calmed
down
the
aggressiveness
of
the
sugar
coated
grapefruit
and
the
citrus
hops
and
made
this
ipa
a
very
well
rounded
brew
without
it
it
would
have
just
been
grapefruit
juice
with
hops
added
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
an
aftertaste
that
tasted
just
like
the
aftertaste
you
would
get
after
drinking
a
whole
glass
of
grapefruit
juice
grab
your
grapefruit
spoon
and
did
in
because
youre
going
to
need
it
a
nice
addition
to
great
lakes
brewed

round
list
would
the
hero
of

erie
commodore
perry
himself
drink
this
beer
if
he
was

alive
only
if
he
liked

with

passion

as
well
as

to
have
this

with
a

after
a

seconds
the
bitterness
hangs
on
pretty
solid
into
the

mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
carbonation
on
the
light
end

this
one
is
not

it
really
does
seem
to
be
stuck
between
american

the
bitterness
is
a
touch
harsh
as
well
i
dont
think
this
one
would
be
my
choice
for
an
ipa
when
i
hit
the
stores
bitter
aftertaste

oily
with
notes
of
pine

kind
of
aggressive
acidity
that
will
put
a
smile
on
any
hopheads
face
medium

and
carbonation
grass
mostly
grapefruit

very

probably
not
a
good
way
to
start
but
i
bought
this
beer
on
clearance
0

per
bottle
a
couple
months
after
christmas
going
to
stock
up
after
tasting
it
bad
elf
pours
a
very
interesting
orange
color
and
smell
and
taste
are
both
bright
and
floral
i
appreciate
this
ipa
for
being
less
hop
and
citrus
and
more
spice
and
rose
i
found
it
quite
interesting
and
fun
to
drink
perhaps
its
the
season
getting
ready
to
change
but
the
beer
speaks
more
of
springtime
than
christmas
to
me
although
i
suppose
the
spice
may
come
through
nicely
during
the
holidays
overall
a
unique
an
easy
drinking
brew
loved
it
overall
drinkability
not
an
amazing
beer
but
definitely
one
that
works
to
be
drank
in
a
full
pint
any
less
and
i
think
i
would
have
missed
something
works
very
nicely
with
food
cabbage
and
noodles
i
would
not
mind
another
small
serving
but
i
dont
think
i
would
want
another
full
bottle
not
an
ipa
fan
but
not
bad
would
drink
if
given
as
a
present
again
youre
actually
a
pretty
good
elf
or
a
tasty
elf
at
least
serving
type
bottle
happy
holidayscheers
pours
a
thin
straw
yellow
with
a
little
head
that
leaves
a
trail
on
the
glass
the
smell
has
citrus
and
bread
scents
running
through
the
taste
was
a
bit
underwhelming
but
the
warmth
from
the
alcohol
was
nice
with
the
citrus
from
the
hops
not
a
bad
beer
to
have
during
the
winter
months
o
fizzy
carbonation
and
sour
mash
and
apple
juice
flavors
put
this
one
at
below
average
for
me
it
wasnt
terrible
just
not
something
i
was
that
in
to
bad
elf
pours
a
bright
straw
golden
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
sweet
cheap
grain
and
adjunct

the
taste
is
the
same
a
cheap
grainy
backbone
lots
of
adjunct
like
flavors
sweet
apple
notes
too
light
which
is
good
but
has
a
nice
crisp
feel
overall
its
watery
plain
and
not
too
great
this
is
one
of
the
better

for
the

probably
wont
change
your
mind
overall
a
decent
english
ipa
mild
smooth
and
drinkable
though
nothing
that
really
stands
out
reminds
me
a
bit
of
deschutes
chasin
freshies
though
not
quite
as
complex
nor
as
assertive
this
is
actually
a
pretty
good
beer
and
certainly
drinkable
nice
hop
presence
and
good
balance
but
who
the
hell
brews
a
hoppy
pale
ale
as
a
christmas
brew
it
just
doesnt
seem
right
theres
nothing
linking
it
to
the
season
other
than
the
branding
ive
marked
it
down
slightly
as
a
result
would
probably
be
better
in
summer
worth
trying
but
if
youre
expecting
warmth
or
spices
then
youll
be
disappointed
poured

itim
going
to
cut
right
to
the
chase
this
is
clearly
a
novelty
beer
and
it
was
disgusting
granted
winter
ales
arent
my
favorite
but
this
wasnt
a
winter
ale
as
the
label
claims
it
tastes
cheap
and
hits
you
like
a
cheap
shot
of
liquor
its
a
great
christmas
gift
but
a
terrible
drink
grab
a
anchor
bells
or
great
lakes
christmas
instead
bought
a
couple
of
these
down
at
the
craft
beer
outlet
and
im
a
bit
disappointed
ah
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
winter
ale
or
really
look
like
one
that
said
it
is
a
fairly
dry
ipa
with
some
bitter
orange
flavors
and
alfalfa
golden
orange
color
a
nice
big
head
that
fizzled
away
but
left
some
nice
lacing
i
might
just
drink
another
one
good
not
must
have
o
a
pretty
nice
and
balanced
english
ipa
i
could
have
stood
for
a
little
more
malty
fruity
esters
and
a
stronger
malt
backbone
but
it
was
still
good
at
6
abv
it
reminded
me
more
of
a
german
helles
than
an
english
ipa
but
i
do
know
that
i
liked
it
regardless
that
bastard
elf
this
stuff
pours
a
wan
tawn
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
musty
orange
peel
dark
greens
dusty
green
apple
and
dry
biscuits
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
everything
coming
through
blander
mustier
gotta
tell
ya
it
aint
all
that
satisfying
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
feel
overall
a
pretty
sad
eipa
allaround
straight
up
dr
decently
drinkable
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
its
too
simple
and
bland
especially
for
the
style
o
looks
good
smells
good
tastes
bland
i
would
drink
this
beer
if
it
was
around
but
overall
i
felt
it
was
fairly
average
d
the
aroma
was
typical
and
fine
the
taste
was
quite
underwhelming
and
got
to
the
point
of
slightly
gross
near
the
end
rjt
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
vibrant
honeygold
coloring
with
no
head
aromas
of
dry
light
hops
with
an
effervescent
feel
lemony
citrus
highlights
on
the
nose
with
a
rich
malt
character
as
well
the
beers
flavors
are
light
at
first
with
a
dry
peppery
hopping
on
the
tongue
followed
by
a
more
full
robust
roasted
taste
that
leads
to
a
slight
sweet
malt
flavor
light
bodied
with
no
cling
to
the
glassware
the
palate
ends
up
being
very
well
blended
with
a
spicy
and
slightly
citrusy
aftertaste
the
finish
is
very
crisp
and
clean
with
a
slight
drying
bitterness
and
spice
that
clears
the
palate
for
the
next
drink
tasty
overall
very
nice
and
well
done
winter
ale
in
my
opinion
this
compares
easily
to
some
other
easy
winter
beers
such
as
sam
adams
winter
lager
there
is
nice
and
rich
flavor
easy
to
drink
for
every
beer
drinker
and
even
suits
very
well
with
food
this
is
still
far
from
the
some
dark
deep
and
even
smokey
beers
which
somebody
may
dislike
i
was
at
the
kendall
pub
enjoying
themany
fine
offerings
they
have
from
ridgeway
which
included
the
bad
elf
the
beer
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
slight
haze
there
was
a
thin
white
head
that
provided
good
retention
the
scent
was
slightly
fruity
yeast
aroma
and
earthy
hops
the
taste
was
good
fruit
and
butter
flavors
are
prominent
with
an
earthy
hop
note
beneath
bitterness
is
moderate
a
little
astringent
and
at
odds
with
the
diacetyl
overall
not
a
bad
beer
o
yes
i
would
definitely
slot
this
into
an
english
ipa
and
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
the
american
cousin
and
would
be
interested
in
trying
one
brewed
on
original
soil
the
neat
balance
between
biscuit
malt
and
fruity
to
dry
bitter
hops
is
very
appetizing
drinkability
if
this
elf
was
bad
and
the
dude
on
the
label
looks
pretty
sinister
then
he
cannot
be
too
far
from
good
it
is
pretty
decent
stuff
though
overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
english
style
ipas
in
part
because
of
the
hops
profiles
and
in
part
because
of
freshness
issues
in
imported
beers
i
do
like
the
bitter
citrus
hops
in
this
one
but
i
think
it
suffers
from
freshness
issues
i
need
to
go
to
england
overall
its
a
decent
drinkable
ipa
taste
is
very
much
in
the
english
ipa
spectrum
of
heavy
bittering
on
top
of
breaded
yeasty
malt
although
once
again
i
find
that
the
yeasts
and
hops
seem
shelfdegraded
ill
have
to
come
back
and
modify
this
review
should
i
ever
get
my
hands
on
a
fresher
example
the
florals
notes
have
been
dulled
and
made
sparse
but
one
can
tell
that
the
bittering
of
the
hops
has
been
carefully
balanced
against
the
sweetness
too
bad
thats
all
im
left
with
in
this
somewhat
chewy
medium
bodied
brew
imho
the
body
could
stand
to
benefit
from
either
being
much
heavier
or
much
lighter
this
middle
ground
doesnt
play
right
across
the
tongue
for
the
flavors
it
carries
of
course
it
might
be
just
perfectly
bodied
for
the
flavor
profile
of
a
fresh
bottle
but
i
am
forced
to
review
with
what
i
have
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
light
golden
color
the
head
was
soapy
and
white
there
was
a
light
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
hoppy
with
some
malts
in
the
back
end
the
taste
has
a
good
bitterness
to
it
and
some
grainy
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
light
side
overall
its
a
pretty
standard
english
ipa
while
this
beer
is
not
wonderful
or
amazing
it
is
incredibly
drinkable
really
pleasant
all
around
and
an
almost
quaffing
brew
thats
just
simple
but
good

laying
one
down
from

the
beer
did

wont

that
again
not
a
winter
ale
as
i

it
would
be

very

it
would
make

i
like
this

which

exciting
the
drink
is

in

with
minimal

a
nice
drink
and
very
citrusy
for
an
english

the
taste
is
initially
pretty
good
but
kind
of
fizzles
and
goes
in
a
bunch
of
different
directions
you
get
some
up
front
alcohol
and
some
malt
sugars
but
the
thin
texture
doesnt
lend
itself
to
the
kick
or
flavor
theres
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
for
a
flash
but
it
passes
quickly
and
the
finish
is
sweet
and
just
kind
of
fades
away
i
usually
like
english
ipas
but
this
one
doesnt
really
have
the
bitterness
or
hop
profile
or
the
malt
or
toasted
qualities
to
be
a
winter
warmer
or
strong
ale
its
kind
of
a
hybrid
but
not
something
im
going
to
search
out
again
i
recommend
this
beer
for
those
who
want
to
try
a
winter
type
ale
m
nothing
spectacular
but
glad
i
finally
found
a
bottle
to
give
this
a
try
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
it
but
it
was
pretty
good
this
brew
pours
a
nice
orangy
amber
with
a
thick
white
head
although
it
is
an
ipa
the
aroma
is
surprisingly
malty
with
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
flavor
is
richly
hoppy
with
a
strong
malt
component
a
hint
of
fruity
sweetness
and
only
a
whisper
of
hop
bitterness
it
goes
down
smoothly
but
with
a
good
alcohol
edge
and
a
hoppy
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
d
this
was
okay
it
wasnt

flavorful
as
some

of

not
a

at
all

this

i
could
imagine
drinking
it
each

and
think
i
will
from
now
on
with
some
hops
thrown
in
upon
the
pour
from
the
500ml

the
beer
appears
a
slightly

with

modest
off

head
that
settles

for

a
very
clean
beer
tastes
good
but
i
wasnt
overwhelmed
by
it
a
very
ordinary
beer
i
may
have
overhyped
it
in
my
mind
because
of
the
cool
bottle
i
thought
this
beer
was
quite
drinkable
and
did
not
overpower
you
with
the
hops
very
well
balanced
and
the
crisp
toasted
malt
reminded
me
somewhat
of
a
lager
not
bad
not
something
that
i
would
rush
out
to
get
got
it
as
partof
abeer
of
the
month
d
got
this
for
free
and
id
drink
it
again
for

not
worth

prices
imo
drinkability
good
beer
finds
a

plus
it

are

the
beer
surprised
me

with
tiny
bubbles
streaming
up
the
side
of
the
glass
it
poured
with
a
smooth
textured

fell
quickly
and
lace
the
glass
a
definite
hop
presence
in
the
nose
and
the
taste
was
at
first
malt
then
a
definitive
hop
flavor
that
stopped
just
short
of
overpowering
a
very
fresh
tasting
smooth
drinkable
ipa
when
i
saw
winter
ale
i
expected
something
a
bit
darker
and
maltier

was

reminiscent
of
a
belgian
tripel
the
taste
was
a
little
sweet
and
malty
and
like
the
smell
it
reminded
me
of
a
belgian
ale
the
hoppiness
seemed
low
for
an
ipa
but
it
came
out
a
bit
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
mediumfull
body
and
modest
carbonation
it
was
relatively
clean
this
was
a
very
nice
drinkable
ale
and
the
6
abv
was
not
apparent
dexcellent
cold
weather
brew
very
easy
drinking
ipa
both
due
to
the
thin
body
and
the
very
nice
flavor
the
taste
more
closely
resembles
an
american
ipa
so
id
recommend
this
one
to
enjoys
an
ipa
brewed
on
either
side
of
the
pond
medium
bodya
good
sticky
hop
feela
very
drinkable
beereasy
drinkingpleasing
and
satisfying
nothing
fancy
here
just
a
very
good
beerwish
i
had
another
drinkability
a
perfectly
proper
english
take
on
the
ipa
very
subtle
and
balanced
but
if
you
like
bold
hops
may
not
be
your
glass
of
beer
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
balance
is
excellent
no
really
noticeable
alcohol
presence
not
sure
why
this
is
a
winter
beer
honestly
crisp
pretty
refreshing
very
drinkable
wouldnt
mind
having
another
without
a
doubt
the
best
english
ipa
ive
had
not
sure
the
price
justifies
buying
this
every
year
but
at
least
i
got
to
try
it
and
keep
the
cute
and
cartoonsh
xmas
themed
bottle
poured
from
a
16
9
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
had
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
slowly
dissipated
no
lacing
the
smell
was
heavy
on
the
hops
as
expected
since
the
label
says
they
put
3
pounds
of
hops
into
each
barrel
the
aroma
started
out
strong
then
faded
pretty
rapidly
as
it
warmed
up
the
taste
was
average
and
really
didnt
leave
that
great
an
impression
since
it
was
kinda
weak
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
except
that
they
cost
is
way
on
the
expensive
side
for
what
you
get
the
mouthfeel
was
also
average
with
just
a
hint
of
creamy
overall
a
decent
beer
with
great
marketing
dont
fall
for
it
slightly
recommend
but
dont
hurt
yourself
finding
it

up

light

a

some

traces

if
youre

you
may
be
shaking
for

yet
this
is
a
nicely
laid
back
eipa
decent
for
the
style
best
when
enjoyed
fresh
pretty
good
overall
originally
a
little
hoppier
i
recall
this
years
seems
a
tad
more
malty
to
the
palate
but
this
is
still
a
solid
brew
despite
the
fact
that
i
dont
really
consider
this
to
be
a
traditional
winter
ale
by
any
definition
that
said
this
is
by
far
the
best
of
the
elf
range
of
beers
from
ridgeway
for
my
money
the
very
bad
seriously
bad
and
criminally
bad
just
get
worse
with
strength
bad
elf
is
the
original
and
harks
back
to
its
roots
and
doing
what
ridgeway
do
best
more
of
a
premium
hoppy
english
bitter
than
anything
to
do
with
christmas
or
winter

a
little
expensive
but
a
pleasant
brew
overall
i
liked
this
pretty
well
a
bit
pricey
but
an
enjoyable
english
import
this
beer
is
fab
no
its
not
an
american
ipa
if
you
been
to
the
motherland
and
enjoy
british
beers
youll
like
this
one
its
rather
delicate
for
being
a
winter
brew
pours
a
lovely
straw
colour
in
a
pint
glass
there
is
light
citrus
and
a
tad
of
diacytl
followed
by
solid
bitterness
there
are
no
rough
edges
just
a
very
civilized
brew
if
you
dont
like
british
beers
its
a
waste
of
time
appears
golden
amber
in
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
off
white
head
smells
of
citrus
hops
and
some
sweetness
like
caramel
tastes
of
grapefruit
with
the
sweetness
of
caramel
with
a
little
bit
of
bitter
aftertones
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
little
tingle
nice
sticking
feel
afterwards
very
good
english
ipa
though
not
very
christmas
inspired
and
kinda
expensive
better
than
average
but
not
worth
the
5bottle
taste
was
thankfully
not
as
sweet
as
i
worried
it
might
be
though
id
have
expected
a
little
more
spice
orange
peel
white
pepper
coriander
for
a
winter
ale
an
english
ale
that
is
not
at
all
unpleasant
even
drinkable
but
not
spectacular
poured
a
big
head
it
is
living
in
a
world
of
dry
citrus
and
spciy
aromas
at
first
taste
it
was
a
english
ale
that
had
desires
to
become
bigger
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
more
rich
than
i
expected
sort
of
creamy
it
is
definately
an
english
ale
further
into
the
session
it
became
increasingly
hoppy
to
my
palate
and
more
complex
a
good
time
pretty
good
a
moderately
hoppy
beer
not
sure
how
it
fits
into
the
whole
winter
seasonal
scene
but
i
guess
even
santa
needs
a
hop
fix
now
and
then
competition
for
celebration
wont
be
coming
from
this
direction
overall
a
solid
medium
bodied
beer
very
drinkable
but
somewhat
expensive
pours
a
goldenamber
color
topped
by
a
smallish
creamy
white
head
that
descends
into
a
small
halo
quite
quickly
aroma
of
crisp
english
hops
lightly
fruity
malt
and
a
touch
of
light
fruit
primarily
apricot
palate
is
nice
and
typical
of
a
good
english
ipa
crisp
fruity
hops
light
fruity
malt
overall
a
nice
tart
fruitiness
medium
body
has
a
pleasant
creamy
character
to
it
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
if
it
werent
for
the
rather
high
price
very
alelike
for
a
christmas
beer
in
that
i
mean
a
strong
pale
estery
fruity
and
hoppy
brew
without
the
amber
or
red
malts
that
i
expected
instead
i
found
a
pale
malt
brew
with
big
fresh
english
hops
that
shows
a
lot
of
pine
and
earthy
character
mildly
woody
but
reliant
on
peach
appricot
apple
and
pear
flavors
to
carry
the
brew
spicy
and
mellowed
with
a
nice
maturation
feels
medium
to
the
palate
with
a
firm
texture
that
rides
into
the
finish
finishes
with
a
warm
hoppy
flavor
and
feel
good
brew
but
not
what
i
expect
from
a
christmas
brew
overall
drinkablility
is
good
will
try
this
again
refreshing
dont
expect
hops
like
an
ipa
almost
has
a
cider
quality
has
that
ridgeway
quality
to
it
yes
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
gotten
more
refreshing
ipa
i
like
it
bit
dont
love
it
good
ber
to
sample
every
once
in
a
while
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
clean
good
as
a
beer
but
this
is
much
closer
to
a
pale
ale
or
golden
ale
than
anything
resembling
a
traditional
winter
seasonal
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
and
would
make
a
good
beer
to
prepare
for
the
transition
from
your
heavier
winter
fare
into
those
lighter
brews
for
your
warmer
months
ahead
poured
a
perfectly
crystal
clear
medium
amber
color
head
is
a
slightly
creamy
offwhite
and
has
slowly
fallen
to
a
thick
ring
with
light
surface
coating
nice
creamy
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
hoppy
with
many
citrus
and
piney
notes
to
be
found
some
summer
fruitiness
also
present
to
form
a
nice
combination
with
thhops
initial
taste
is
a
medium
bitterness
that
almost
immediately
fades
to
allow
some
fruity
maltiness
to
show
through
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
finish
is
a
moderate
dry
bitterness
that
definitely
beckons
for
another
taste
whicj
i
will
gladly
satisfy
some
alcohol
also
begins
to
show
itself
at
the
ending
with
a
nice
warm
feeling
in
the
mouth
very
drinkable
and
superbly
enjoyable
this
is
really
an
excellent
beer
and
the
label
is
nice
too

of

a

rising

down
some

with

in

the
body
was
disappointing
fairly
thin
lacking
the
malt
backbone
i
would
expect
weak
hop
expression
with
some
citrus
hops
bringing
up
the
rear
not
one
that
i
will
spend
my
money
on
in
the
future
a
good
beer
enjoyable
but
at
its
price
ill
have
to
pass
this
by
for
other
good
options
presentation
packaged
in

sixteen

bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
between
this
very
bad
elf
and
seriously
bad
elf
this
one
appealed
the
to
me
the
least
out
of
the
three
cant
quite
pinpoint
why
that
is
but
for
an
ipa
this
was
nothing
special
and
even
less
so
as
a
winter
release
cheers
cheers
overall
i
did
can
really
dig
this
beer
but
at
almost
5
a
bottle
i
might
pass
in
the
future
also
saying
a
winters
ale
on
the
bottle
made
me
think
it
was
a
winter
warmer
which
it
is
not
i
think
i
would
enjoy
this
more
on
a
hot
day
a
high
quality
beer
id
love
to
try
a
caskconditioned
version
of
this
this
brew
is
an
orange
color
with
a
moderately
sized
white
head
the
liquid
is
very
clear
the
aroma
is
citric
decidedly
and
almost
sourly
grapefruit
and
give
the
impression
of
freshness
theres
a
little
grain
and
malt
underneath
but
theyre
hidden
far
behind
the
hops
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aromaserious
citric
hoppiness
with
a
faint
undertone
of
malt
its
a
little
grainy
fairly
dry
and
decently
carbonated
its
refreshing
and
cleansing
to
be
sure
but
i
thought
that
this
one
could
have
been
helped
by
a
little
more
sweetness
and
balance
its
drinkable
and
worth
a
glass
i
wouldnt
call
it
an
englishstyle
ipa
thoughit
sure
seems
to
take
its
inspiration
from
the
west
coast
d
this
is
a
nice
smooth
english
style
ipa
it
would
be
nice
with
a
bit
more
body
and
if
the
malt
had
a
bit
more
depth
to
enhance
the
hops
very
quaftable
non
the
less
this
one
grew
on
me
the
more
i
drank
it
not
bad
extremely
smooth
on
the
drink
creamy
mouthfeel
nicely
done
taste
is
slightly
bitter
and
slightly
floral
a
touch
of
lavendar
and
clove
some
subtle
hops
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
flavors
are
small
but
complex
well
balanced
i
like
it
the
taste
is
fairly
dry
with
a
nice
sharp
almost
biting
bitterness
that
carries
through
to
the
end
the
hop
flavor
is
a
mix
of
herbal
perhaps
even
grassy
and
lemon
like
citrus
notes
there
is
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
that
sneaks
in
to
the
middle
of
this
beer
it
accentuates
the
citrus
character
a
bit
and
provides
some
balance
to
the
hop
notes
this
has
a
nice
heft
to
it
that
is
not
too
light
and
yet
not
so
heavy
that
this
is
not
quaffable
this
beer
tastes
quite
similar
to
what
i
would
describe
as
an
american
brewed
english
style
ipa
restrained
crystal
malt
character
with
lots
of
hop
character
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
simple
grain
sweetness
picks
up
a
bit
and
this
in
turn
accentuates
the
citrus
notes
a
bit
even
picks
up
some
notes
of
orange
this
is
definitely
quite
enjoyable
md
the
initially
smooth
mouthfeel
is
balanced
with
the
subsequent
overwhelming
bitterness
and
hops
very
satisfyingly
hoppy
strong
ale
though
id
expect
its
body
to
be
a
bit
more
rounded
and
betterbalanced
with
more
assertive
malts
suppose
in
one
more
year
of
ageing
it
could
just
be
like
that
shall
buy
another
bottle
and
age
it
solid
brew
this
pours
a
dark
bronze
with
a
2
finger
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
mixture
of
malt
and
hops
make
this
a
nice
smelling
beer
howeverthis
mixture
is
a
little
tough
on
the
taste
buds
this
is
very
malty
and
very
hoppy
togetherthis
makes
a
beer
that
is
not
very
balanced
at
all
i
think
if
they
cut
back
alittle
this
would
be
better
tasting
the
mf
is
medium
and
very
unbalanced
this
is
not
a
bad
beerbut
the
hype
doesnt
live
up
to
the
taste
mdr
good
carbonation
and
medium
body
i
prefer
more
hops
in
my
ipas
but
i
know
this
is
an
english
style
so
its
okay
and
it
works
nonetheless
this
is
a
tasty

beer
mellowing

out
i
like
it
quite
drinkable
very
enjoyable
brew
although
i
wouldnt
knock
more
than
two
of
these
back
in
rapid

i
am
keeping
a

on

for
when
the
the
typical
american
counterpart
isnt
what
i
am
looking
for
on
tap
at
the
blind
tiger
in
nyc
bartender
kate
told
me
this
one
was
a
little

i
saw
it
as
simply
on
the
low

that
was
just
fine

and
very
pleasant
brit
brew
with
pleanty
of

i
havent
tried
it
in
bottles
but
the
tap
version
is
deserving
of
a
try
or
two
if
you
find
it
on
at
your
local
this
is
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
lots
of

rising
up

hopped
for
the
style
at
least
compared
to
what
i
have
had
not
quite
as
intense
as
the
west
coasters
here
but
a
nice
hoppy
treat
med
bodied
nice
english
style
ipa
drinkability
just
ok
marred
by
the
alcohol
penols
that
get
in
the
way
of
the
malt
and
hop
flavors
a
cloudy
golden
color
and
if
you
put
it
up
in
light
you
can
see
tiny
yeast
particals
the
head
is
very
good
not
sticky
but
stays
in
place
i
can
smell
a
nice
aroma
of
hops
the
taste
is
very
balanced
malts
hit
the
tounge
first
but
followed
soon
with
a
spicy
hop
flavor
the
hops
tend
to
stick
around
a
bit
a
very
good
english
pale
ale
but
i
cant
say
it
is
a
ipa
lovely
toast

under

that
doesnt
leave
any

overall
so
light
and
lovely
that
despite
all
the
other
fantastic
beers
in
this
place
i
must
have
another
i
had
a
small
sample
of
this
beer
from
what
was
left
in
the
firkin
after
the
big
opening
of
saturnalia
last
night
at
richos
the
beer
poured
a
nice
yellowed
golden
color
with
a
nice
figer
or
two
of
head
with
some
retention
the
nose
was
full
of
grapefruit
hop
and
some
very
earthy
undertones
as
well
the
flavor
was
really
nice
with
a
great
hop
profile
with
grapefruit
and
caramel
from
the
malts
how
nice
the
beer
was
moderate
to
thick
and
creamy
nice
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
and
i
think
i
enjoyed
it
more
on
cask
better
than
from
the
bottle
drinkability
a
great
beer
that
would
be
tasty
any
time
of
year
pours

aroma

floral
earthy
hops
musty

lots
of
hops
hard
to
find
the
malt
in
the
nose
taste
is
hops
mixture
of
bitter
grapefruit
and
musty
grass
leave
a
lingering
bitterness
that
asks
for
more
please
not
overly
bitter
by
any
means
just
lots
good
hop
flavors
i
get
a
touch
of
sweetness
from
the
malt
at
the
start
that
is
soon
overtaken
by
glorious
hops
this
is
one
serious
english
style
ipa
must
say
i
enjoyed
it
mouthfeel
is
little
light
but
then
again
hops
dont
have
much
body
drinkability
is
good
it
has
restored
my
faith
in
english
style
ipas
overall
i
was
really
pleased
with
this
brew
i
was
expecting
the
same
old
spicy
winter
taste
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
a
really
nice
winter
ipa
would
definitely
recommend
anyone
trying
no
matter
what

drinkability
is
solid
traditional
english
ale
well
done
for
the
most
part
but
underlying
note
of
sulfur
and
mineral

is
slightly
offputting
i
sampled
this
at
the
local
pub
actually
stole
a
drink
from
kmpitz2
as
it
was
he
who
ordered
it
it
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
small

that
dies
off
quickly
and
doesnt

much

on

the
aroma
is
very
hoppy

hops
mostly
with
some
caramel

backbone
the
flavor
was
much
the

definately
an

nice

very

there
is

finish
i
like
the
label
and
that
warning
about
driving
and
machinery
we
need
humor
wherever
we
can
get
it
i
was
happy
with
this
though
for
a
winter
alei
prefer
snca
unfortunately
i
havent
gotten
hold
of
this

version
yet
poures
a
light
golden
with
a
orange
hue
to
it
with
a
huge
fluffy
that
sticks
like
glue
to
the
sides
of
my
pint
glass
that
was
a
little
unexpectedbig
aroma
of
lemon
rind
and
some
leafy
hoppness
very
fresh
and
vibrant
definently
bold
a
really
dry
brew
some
spearament
notes
and
some
grean
leafy
elements
a
big
crisp
dry
malt
backbone
holds
up
well
with
the
big
bitterness
of
this
beer
a
real
english
ipa
highly
hopped
but
not
over
the
top
by
any
means
dry
and
crisp
a
real
drinker
i
wish
i
had
more
nice
enough
but
the
grinning
evil
elf
on
the
label
led
me
to
believe
something
more
sinister
pours
a
bad
elf
ass
deep
honey
color
and
displays
ample
sticky
head
and
lace
aromas
feature
lemony
hop
and
sweet
biscuit
in
the
mouth
the
beer
offers
more
lemony
biscuit
flavors
and
a
big
kiss
of
bitter
hop
while
i
find
this
beer
attractive
it
seems
to
lack
individualality
hence
making
it
just
another
decent
ipa
in
my
book
albiet
i
love
it
when
a
winter
seasonal
is
something
other
than
a
spiced

definitely
some

oh
yeah
taste
layers

for

it
comes
through
in
micro
bursts
of

from

slight

for
500ml
bad
elf
was
probably
a
good
choice
for
the
name
of
this
because
i
could
imagine
a
couple
of
elfs
gone
bad
being
squeezed
into
the
mix
of
this
concoction
i
hate
to
be
mean
to
beer
but
the
old
saying
too
many
spices
ruin
the
soup
can
be
applied
i
cant
completely
knock
this
advent
beer
i
can
see
where
it
was
trying
to
go
but
maybe
it
shouldnt
have
gone
that
far
the
beer
does
pour
a
decent
orangy
color
with
a
good
head
its
thick
and
coaty
to
the
tongue
which
would
be
good
except
that
the
overrush
of
fruity
nutty
bready
and
spicy
just
seem
to
remind
me
of
a
swedish
herb
cough
drop
but
hey
if
you
are
ever
laid
up
in
bed
with
the
flu
it
would
make
a
great
alternative
to
cough
syrup
and
the
buzz
would
be
much
better
sorry
bad
elf
but
when
people
ask
me
what
i
think
of
you
the
usual
reaction
is
gak
pours
with
a
smallbubbled

head
about
a

deep
that
slowly
recedes
to
less
than
half
a

regains
some
life
with
a
good
swirl
no
cling
to
the
lace
there
are
a
few

the
beer

really

invigoratingly
refreshing
personally
i
find
this
brews
flavor
and
character
more
in
fitting
with
the
celebration
of
springs
thaw
than
for
stretching
out
next
to
the
fireplace
in
winter
but
i
still
found
this
quite
enjoyable
a
pleasant
surprise
on
tap
at
lucky
baldwins
it
goldenorange
with
a
thick
white
head
the
leaves
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
decidedly
hoppy
with
load
of
malt
and
some
spice
the
taste
is
on
the
bitter
side
but
certainly
not
over
the
top
moutfeel
is
nice
and
it
goes
down
well
i
used
it
to
wash
down
some
chicken
curry
at
baldwins
if
i
hadnt
known
i
would
have
pegged
this
as
a
pacific
northwest
ipa
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
but
very
satisfying
slightly
hazed
light
amber
tone
small
and
disjointed
bone
white
head
after
a
minute
a
thin
rimming
is
all
thats
left
the
aroma
is
strong
and
upfront
and
quite
nice
citrusy
resiny
pungent
mint
and
bigtime
bubblegum
the
taste
is
stylin
this
has
got
to
be
the
most
hopped
up
uk
beer
ive
ever
had
youd
guess
it
was
from
the
west
coast
usa
if
you
didnt
know
better
the
hop
flavors
are
pungent
and
somewhat
raw
bitter
and
piney
smoky
and
cannabis
like
resiny
and
ctitc
damn
this
is
pretty
good
the
malt
backing
proves
to
be
more
than
capable
and
is
toffee
based
body
is
a
little
better
than
medium
and
this
beer
flows
over
the
tongue
with
ease
the
one
negative
is
the
price
tag
5

i
can
find
ipas
from

just
as
good
for

glad
i
tried
it
once
though

a
nice

bite
medium
body
with
a
creamy
soft
mouthfeel
fishes
with
a
clean
and
pleasant
bitterness
a
decent
ale
this
beer
is
nothing
like
a
traditional
christmas
beer
i
respect
the
brewerys
right
to
call
it
anything
they
want
but
they
might
as
well
have
called
it
crazy
cupid
or
psychotic
bunny
as
bad
elf
if
youre
in
a
holiday
mood
drink
a
troegs
mad
elf
or
any
of
the
other
spiced
ales
if
you
want
a
respectable
ipa
no
matter
the
season
reach
for
a
bad
elf
a
rough
pour
brings
up
an
inch
thick
head
of
frothy
white
foam
that
receeds
to
a
shorter
but
denser
creamy
layer
in
a
few
moments
the
tradeoff
however
is
that
it
disturbs
the
yeast
sediment
and
leaves
its
goldenamber
body
somewhat
hazy
still
tiny
bubbles
are
clearly
visible
climbing
slowly
towards
the
surface
what
remains
of
the
head
leaves
some
nice
lace
about
the
glass
and
overall
its
a
very
nice
appearance
hops
are
clear
in
the
nose
with
a
brightly
citrus
and
piney
character
its
bold
fresh
and
inviting
the
way
a
real
ale
should
be
the
body
is
medium
and
its
very
fine
and
natural
bottle
conditioned
restrained
carbonation
is
just
lightly
tingly
on
the
tongue
before
fading
away
smooth
the
flavor
delivers
the
lemonycitrus
and
resiny
sprucepinelike
hop
flavors
promised
by
the
nose
over
a
biscuity
malt
a
bold
bitterness
balances
and
its
fades
away
dry
with
a
quick
flash
of
juicy
fruitiness
followed
by
a
residual
note
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
quite
impressive

a

not

the
beer
for
you
mainlining

that
thought
the
uk
couldnt
brew
something
to
cure
your

tremors
find
this

taste
english
malt
is
the
first
gift
of
flavor
to
the
tongue
followed
by
a
shower
of
minerals
and
floral
grassy
hops
dry

present
came
in
the
middle
and
one
the
end
very
similiar
to
a
true
english
cask
ale
the
last
present
is
a
slightly
bitter
dry
taste
and
clean
finish
this
present
transports
me
to
an
english
pub
during
the
holiday
a
great
escape
and
a
great

this

flavor
profile
falls
just
short
of
outstanding
it
is
intense
but
falls
short
in
balance
and
complexity
it
has
a
nice
hop
flavor
focus
herbal
citric
and
rind
over
a
mild
bitterness
in
the
middle
caramel
and
biscuit
sweetness
appear
in
the
finish
but
are
overwhelmed
by
rind
and
pine
hop
flavor
this
hop
flavor
lingers
typical
eipa
with
perhaps
a
bit
more
substance
than
many
floral
citrus
grapefruit
notes
that
linger
for
a
couple
of
minutes
o
kinda
meh
not
my
cup

harsh
and
unpleasant
if
you
can
appreciate
an
eipa
this
is

bet
great

commodore

with
a

the

with
a

and
some

the
aroma
is
pretty
mild
with
some
light

aromas
think
dried

the
taste
is
alright
there
is
neither
the
malt
depth
of
traditional
english
ipas
or
the
hops
of
american
ipas
its
not
a
bad
flavor
but
its
not
very
complicated
the
body
is
lighter
as
an
english
ipa
tends
toward
and
its
not
bad
but
its
not
really
going
to
blow
you
away
o
i
picked
this
up
in
a
mix
six
as
ive
been
wanting
to
try
it
as
much
as
i
want
to
encourage
nc
craft
i
wont
be
repeating
this
one
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
crystalclear
goldenyellow
coloring
with
a
steady
flow
of
carbonation
throughout
and
a
short
filmy
clingy
white
head
aromas
of
floral
hops
subtle
caramel
backbone
light
fruit
esters
and
subtle
bitterness
flavors
are
bitter
forward
with
a
tart
citrus
character
of
tangerine
and
grapefruit
followed
by
subtle
toasted
and
caramel
notes
and
some
floral
highlights
the
body
is
smooth
with
a
sharp
edge
to
it
the
aftertaste
is
more
floral
and
sweet
than
anything
with
fruity
notes
up
front
the
finish
is
smooth
somewhat
effervesced
from
the
carbonation
and
slightly
bitter
very
drinkable
english
ipa
this
beer
could
best
be
compared
to
a
poor
version
of
sierra
nevada
nothing
new
or
exciting
here
a
truly
prosaic
and
mediocre
beer
after
a
few
sips
i
poured
this
one
out
there
are
too
many
decent
beers
out
there
so
i
recommend
that
you
skip
this
one
overall
nicely
balanced
and
not
over
the
top
very
enjoyable
o
solid
ipa
that
is
wellbalanced
o
not
sure
what
they
were
going
for
with
this
but
it
missed
the
mark
for
me
i
did
like
it
a
bit
better
when
i
had
it
on
tap
but
was
still
underwhelmed
for
a
better
englishstyle
ipa
also
brewed
in
asheville
try
green
man
ipa
not
bad
at
all
very
vibrant
hop
flavors
and
the
hop
bitterness
is
right
on
the
edge
of
being
too
bitter
without
crossing
that
this
is
one
of
my
new
favourite
ipas
i
just
recently
started
enjoying
ipas
im
more
of
a
stout
guy
myself
i
would
highly
recommend
this
for
someone
who
is
trying
to
get
their
feet
wet
with
ipas
it
is
not
as
bitter
as
some
others
another
ipa
id
recommend
is
sierra
nevadas
torpedo
i
have
no
idea
what
they
were
going
for
here
its
not
an
ipa
but
its
a
good
beer
d
not
a
bad
ipa
but
that
unwanted
lingering
hop
astringency
is
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
otherwise
super
solid
taste
makes
this
pretty
inviting
overall
not
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
again
its
a
little
too
one
dimensional
in
my
opinion
i
think
a
little
more
towards
the
aroma
side
of
the
hops
would
make
this
a
better
beer
i
wouldnt
touch
the
bitterness
i
think
its
fine
my
100th
ipa
rate
maybe
i
should
have
chosen
better
for
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
little
to
no
head
aroma
of
sweet
malt
honey
and
no
hops
at
all
flavor
is
a
muddled
mess
of
honey
and
dusty
stale
hops
i
guess
sweet
malt
all
the
way
through
with
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
light
and
a
bit
watery
what
a
disappointing
ipa
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
overall
not
terrible
but
not
really
something
i
would
return
to
either
o
solid
east
coast
ipa
not
overly
hopped
very
subtle
nice
malt
character
beer
is
a
bright
gold
it
looks
like
sparkling

it
has
a
thin

leaves
some
lacing
aroma
is
slightly
toasty
with
some

and
generic
hops
taste
is
crisp
some
nice
malt
up
front
with
a
pleasantly
bitter
and
slightly
astringent
piney
hops
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
pretty
highly
carbonated
and
overall
the
beer
is
fairly
light
without
being
wimpy
overall
this
is
a
decent
ipa
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
it
is
pretty
crisp
and
refreshing
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
a
unique
spin
on
an
ipa
not
quite
in
the
session
ipa
territory
and
not
quite
a
true
ipa
and
therefore
confusing
closer
to
a
blonde
but
still
a
nice
beer
the
scent
and
taste
were
somewhat
cloned
as
i
got
cereal
malt
graininess
or
maybe
corn
adjuncts
no
metallic
taste
synonymous
with
corn
adjunct
beers
it
was
like
a
watery
heineken
very
light
easy
to
drink
it
was
better
than
bud
but
not
an
ipa
this
was
my
first
exposure
to
a
highland
beer
and
to
be
honest
i
picked
it
up
as
part
of
a
makeyourown6pack
and
didnt
know
what
to
expect
it
is
definitely
on
the
lighter
side
of
ipas
the
ibus
werent
listed
on
the
bottle
but
if
you
want
a
solid
ipa
go
for
something
else
if
you
are
new
to
ipa
andor
craft
beer
this
one
will
be
a
great
stepping
stone

definitely
a

d
as
a
matter
of
preference
i
dont
particularly
care
for
grapefruit
as
its
flavors
tend
to
be
overpowering
and
leave
an
aftertaste
whether
it
be
beer
or
the
fruit
itself
this
however
is
very
good
well
executed
brew
that
goes
down
smooth
and
begs
for
more
to
be
drank
a
pale
amber
color
clear
with
a
good
offwhite
head
and
very
nice
lacing
the
aroma
brings
a
solid
malty
pine
hop
bready
and
full
very
decent
with
a
touch
of
floral
sweetness
the
flavor
suggests
swamp
bread
and
watery
citrus
hop
with
a
weak
malt
hint
the
hop
is
reasonably
present
perhaps
more
along
the
line
of
a
pale
ale
but
its
not
particularly
appealing
in
taste
its
a
fairly
thinnish
brew
lightly
carbonated
and
midland
drinkable
not
very
memorable
but
passable
certainly
not
much
of
an
ipa
overall
this
is
a
pretty
welldone
american
ipa
not
great
but
would
buy
again
light

oats
really
dominate

at

i
think
ive
had
this
for
6
months
at
least
in
the
fridge
so
im
thinking
the
hop
aroma
has
probably
receded
a
bit
taste
is
another
story
lots
of
bitters
noticed
up
front
with
a
quick
wash
over
the
tongue
mouth
is
actually
a
decent
balance
of
malts
and
hops
for
an
ipa
or
a
good
english
style
ipa
maybe
body
is
perfectly
carbonated
and
has
a
nice
texture
on
the
palette
but
the
flavors
are
pretty
hidden
and
deep
finish
is
almost
pale
ale
like
hops
are
very
mild
in
this
one
lacing
is
almost
consistent
through
the
entire
drink

i
would
like
to
say
thanks
to
sholland119
for
tossing
this
in

very
glad

k
on
the
trade
this
is
a
very
average
ipa
i
have
been
drinking
a
lot
of
american
ipas
lately
and
this
is
probably
one
of
my
least
favorites
decent
amount
of
hoppiness
but
not
much
balance
the
taste
and
smell
is
fairly
average
in
comparison
to
most
microbrews
ive
tried
its
a
good
beer
but
not
worth
the
price
of
admission
in
comparison
to
its
competitors
i
highly
recommend
checking
out

makes
a

too
along
with

there
are
others
too
that
id
prefer
over
this
one
drinkability
a
clean
and
solid
ipa
that
needs
a
little
more
kick
to
it
would
reach
for
it
over
other
ipas
but
it
still
doesnt
give
me
the
kick
in
the
ass
i
get
from
other
ipas
but
this
is
a
good
closer
to
a
night
of
drinking
drinkability
a
very
good
ipa
that
is
well
balanced
it
would
be
much
better
with
a
stronger
more
pronounced
hop
aroma
however
this
is
a
clean
crisp
drinking

a

from

that
im

nicely

not

this
is
a

better
than
id

this

there
is
a

i
can
feel
alcohol
warmth
in

its
a

its
not

an

an

very
nice
brew
i
like
it
mouthfeel
is

a

somewhat
weak

drinkability
is
decent
as
far
as
ipas
go
this
is
a
weak
example
not
much
hop
quality
and
a
finish
of
little
hop
bitterness
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
it
is
very
good
i
read
some
recent
reviews
and
they
are
much
lower
than
the
ale
deserves
it
may
have
been
a
bad
batch
so
i
hope
youll
try
it
again
because
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
for
a
mild
ipa
not
too
piney
or
hoppy
but
good
d
drinkable
but
dull
and
boring
plenty
of
better
ipas
on
the
market
this
brew
has
a
zesty
hop
smell
with
slight
malt
undertones
pours
to
a
golden
yellow
with
a
big
highly
structured
head
that
holds
and
leaves
lacing
as
it
recedes
taste
is
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
without
much
fanfare
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
despite
the
great
head
this
brew
needs
some
more
carbonation
hops
are
way
too
subdued
for
a
ipa
the
bitterness
is
there
but
dull
without
aroma
this
brew
is
in
dire
need
of
late
stage
or
dry
hopping
nothing
like
i
expected
drinkability
is
high
i
guess
not
a
very
complex
brew
i
would
try
it
again
if
i
find
it
well
hell
i
know
what
im
drinking
in
session
the
next
time
im
around
asheville
this
must
be
very
good
out
of
the
tap
too
doesnt
come
out
of
the
gates
quickly
but
its
a
marathon
not
a
sprint
thanks

a
yellowishorange
color
in
the
glass
poured
here
with
a
moderately
sized
head
maybe
1cm
that
left
a
little
bit
of
lacing
as
i
drank
looks
about
average
nothing
incredibly
impressive
the
smell
is
very
earthy
different
that
i
expected
and
theres
almost
a
kind
of
catty
skunky
smell
to
it
very
low
on
the
citrus
effect
you
expect
from
an
american
ipa
i
can
also
detect
a
moderate
amount
of
resinous
hop
presence
the
taste
is
a
bit
toasty
and
bready
upfront
kind
of
stuck
somewhere
between
dry
and
sweet
a
kind
of
powerful
malt
backbone
with
a
light
lemon
and
orange
hop
presence
very
low
bitterness
due
to
the
moderate
sweetness
low
ester
presence
and
very
low
on
the
resins
in
the
taste
ive
had
much
worse
but
theres
room
for
improvement
perhaps
a
bit
more
flavor
and
aroma
hops
are
in
order
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
is
carried
through
by
the
sweetness
the
carbonation
was
kind
of
low
it
started
out
with
a
slight
prickle
and
eventually
was
left
as
just
a
tiny
rush
of
tingling
bubbles
by
the
finish
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
nothing
offensive
no
harsh
bitterness
or
odd
flavors
but
nothing
really
impressive
in
the
flavor
worth
a
shot
but
it
probably
will
not
be
a
staple
beer
12oz
bottle
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
with
a
small
offwhite
head
smells
slightly
malty
with
some
caramel
notes
followed
by
piney
hop
bitterness
nothing
overwhelming
the
taste
is
strongly
malty
with
a
bready
character
hop
bitterness
is
strong
in
the
background
not
terribly
complex
medium
body
with
high
carbonation
not
incredibly
drinkable
though
far
from
offensive
drinkability
a
smooth
pleasant
easygoing
ipa
that
strays
away
from
the
excessively
assertive
brutal
hop
doses
that
many
west
coast
ipas
deliver
d
for
an
ipa
this
is
really
malt
forward
i
would
prefer
more
hop
flavor
and
aroma
in
this
one
maltiness
makes
it
feel
heavy
decreasing
its
overall
drinkabilitiy
d
overall
not
a
bad
brew
and
easy
to
drink
judging
by
style
though
this
seems
a
bit
too
balanced
or
at
least
more
of
an
english
ipa
d
drinkable
but
a
bit
bland
nice
if
somewhat
subdued
hop
character
and
powerful
malt
that
leads
to
excellent
balance
overall
good
but
not
great
poured
a
golden
body
with
twofinger
head
with
tints
of
orange
a
semisweet
malt
smell
mixed
with
some
floral
hops
taste
is
the
same
as
the
hops
make
their
appearance
bring
some
herbal
bitterness
and
citric
quality
but
this
is
a
lighter
ipa
that
has
some
good
malt
sweetness
as
well
also
some
spicing
as
well
corriander
not
a
typical
ipa
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
lighter
copper
color
almost
orange
tint
thin
wispy
head
and
not
especially
fragrant
for
an
ipa
the
taste
is
also
on
the
lighter
side
caramel
malt
and
subtle
grapefruit
mouthfeel
is
pretty
average
maybe
a
little
thin
but
all
things
considered
its
a
smooth
drinking
beer
a
relaxed
refreshing
ipa
thats
still
lively
enough
to
keep
your
taste
buds
interested
3
or
4
beers
in
i
could
definitely
lose
track
of
how
many
of
these
id
put
down
it
didnt
start
well
but
halfway
through
it
became
a
pretty
decent
ipa
this
is
probably
really
satisfying
super
fresh
a
great
ipa
although
id
like
to
see
a
bit
more
hop
character
i
may
assume
they
are
going
for
more
of
an
englishscottish
style
which
would
make
this
less
hoppy
but
over
all
a
good
ipa
drinkability
an
extremly
easy
drinkin
ipa
great
session
great
flavor
and
easy
to
pound
i
really
like
it
for
that
reason
d
definitely
hoppy
with
some
malt
character
frankly
very
drinkable
for
this
style
decent
and
one
that
i
would
consider
ordering
again
a
little
heavier
than
most
ipas
though
overall
this
is
a
fine
ipa
and
an
impressive
first
highland
brewing
beer
for
me
im
looking
forward
to
trying
the
rest
of
their
line
overall
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
i
would
if
i
could
get
this
beer
here
if
i
wanted
something
to
enjoy
over
the
night
without
worring
about
getting
a
big
buzz
d
great
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
the
smooth
maltiness
is
a
great
compliment
to
the
hop
dominance
you
usually
get
with
ipas
the
hops
are
great
and
its
just
great
i
love
it
flavor
is
of
toasted
biscuits
weird
offmeat
flavor
and
some
hints
of
sour
lemon
on
the
end
this
tastes
more
like
an
apa
in
my
mind
nothing
tells
me
this
is
an
ipa
im
gonna
move
on
from
this
one
and
avoid
in
the
future
m
very
clean
and
crisp
solid
and
mellow
but
with
a
nice
bite
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
disappearing
head
smells
of
light
floral
and
slight
citrus
notes
taste
is
a
creamy
citrus
sweetness
with
an
odd
back
bite
of
bitterness
very
odd
ipa
lighter
mouthfeel
almost
a
spiciness
to
it
heavier
maltiness
but
not
overpowering
allright
ipa
nothing
spectacular
odd
bitterness
takes
away
from
drinkability
a
bit
unsure
of
this
beers
age
but
the
hop
profile
is
non
existant
as
it
is
it
seems
more
of
an
amber
ale
with
very
low
hops
characteristics
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
in
color
no
head
to
speak
of
only
faint
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
faint
hops
and
some
barley
taste
is
of
fairly
weak
hops
crisp
refreshing
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
a
decent
patio
beer
ive
had
much
better
offerings
from
highland
so
this
seems
to
be
a
one
beer
problem
and
not
a
brewery
problem
for
me
getting
some
caramel
malts
also
a
little
biscuit
and
some
mild
citrus
hops
im
generally
looking
for
more
hops
in
my
ipas
but
if
you
looking
for
balance
this
is
the
brew
for
you
the
appearance
was
a
huge
letdown
but
this
turned
into
a
pretty
solid
brew
highland
kashmir
ipa
pours
a
pale
orange
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
there
is
a
mild
citrusy
aroma
there
is
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
silky
and
a
bit
on
the
thick
side
the
flavor
has
a
nice
hoppy
thing
going
on
but
its
also
fairly
spicy
hoppy
but
not
really
a
hop
bomb
pretty
good
definitely
worth
a
try
after
tasting
several
ipas
from
domestic
breweries
in
recent
months
i
was
very
happy
with
kashmir
it
meets
my
expectations
of
aggressive
hoppiness
i
expect
from
an
ipa
but
without
overdoing
it
to
the
point
that
its
hard
to
drink
i
tend
to
find
many
ipas
lacking
in
drinkability
to
a
degree
but
kashmir
left
me
wating
more
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
highland
brew
as
of
yet
and
its
pretty
high
on
my
list
of
ipas
in
general
will
buy
again
and
suggest
you
try
for
yourself
note
i
first
had
this
beer
on
tap
and
suggest
this
over
a
bottle
unfortunately
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
snooze
fest
for
me
i
wanted
to
enjoy
it
and
give
it
a
chance
i
even
finished
the
whole
thing
in
hopes
that
i
would
be
swayed
at
some
point
its
just
not
realy
an
ipa
to
me
in
fact
id
say
its
a
bit
of
a
stretch
to
call
it
a
hoppy
pale
ale
the
hops
seemed
stale
to
me
but
im
unsure
of
the
age
of
the
bottle
outside
of
when
i
purchased
it
5
months
ago
in
sc
up
the
ante
on
the
hops
3
fold
and
pump
up
the
malt
bill
a
bit
and
lets
start
talking
ipas
pours
a
nice
orangish
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
caramel
malt
and
some
citrusy
hops
the
taste
has
a
solid
malt
backbone
for
an
ipa
with
a
dose
of
citrusy
hops
in
the
finish
overall
kashmir
ipa
is
a
pretty
solid
ipa
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
recommended
even
though
this
beer
might
not
satisfy
hardcore
hop
heads
it
was
a
super
tasty
ipa
nevertheless
overall
a
very
sessionable
and
well
crafted
version
of
the
style
d
this
is
a
pretty
mild
ipa
and
a
very
drinkable
one
i
could
session
with
this
beer
but
its
definitely
not
recommended
for
the
hardcore
hopheads
a
good
but
not
great
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
d
a
rather
tame
ipa
but
also
unique
and
refreshing
i
cant
decide
whether
id
keep
it
mild
or
amp
it
up
a
bit
but
as
it
is
its
still
an
enjoyable
brew
good
mouthfeel
and
good
balance
in
an
ipa
i
am
glad
this
is
now
in
my
market
the
aroma
has
a
grassy
and
floral
hop
with
malt
and
yeast
the
appearance
is
hazy
gold
with
an
average
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
except
its
astringent
the
palate
is
smooth
overall
its
interesting
but
its
not
a
good
ipa
its
bitter
in
a
soapy
way
drinkability
is
good
not
an
outstanding
ipa
but
solid
enough
and
low
enough
abv
to
make
this
a
session
ipa
d
tasty
and
drinks
pretty
easy
t
taste
of
hops
but
with
a
smooth
finish
very
palatable
ipa
that
might
be
dangerous
because
of
its
ease
of
taste
a
nice
selection
from
highland
picked
this
up
at
a
corner
store
ive
had
other
highland
selections
and
this
does
not
diappoint
good
strong
taste
that
is
not
too
hoppy
or
bitter
nice
flavor
combinations
make
this
a
must
have
again
glad
to
see
that
i
can
pick
up
a
local
brew
that
is
of
such
high
quality
md
it
was
a
little
heavier
than
i
was
expecting
a
little
too
think
for
my
taste
i
think
it
was
good
but
not
something
i
would
search
out
again
a
dark
golden
hue
with
a
respectable
top
aroma
is
a
little
subtle
with
some
malt
and
citrus
but
also
with
a
slightly
pungent
background
citrus
flavor
and
slightly
off
caramel
i
think
they
were
going
for
a
woodsy
feel
but
it
falls
a
little
short
not
bad
at
all
but
i
think
a
little
more
bitterness
would
help
mouthfeel
is
full
and
smooth
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
it
is
good
but
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
it
as
an
ipa
d
very
drinkable
but
not
one
i
would
want
to
drink
again
if
that
makes
sense
not
a
lot
to
object
to
here
becasue
there
isnt
a
lot
here
a
bit
of
a
one
trick
pony
but
still
if
you
like
lighter
ipas
and
like
west
coast
hops
this
will
be
the
one
for
you
the
smell
of
hops
is
prevalent
and
it
tastes
like
a
smoother
ipa
than
most
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
crisp
i
love
this
ipa
the
hops
are
not
overpowering
and
the
crisp
taste
is
one
not
to
be
missed
d
this
is
a
good
ipa
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
nice
taste
to
it
not
the
greatest
ipa
but
still
quite
well
done
thanks
to
michaeld23
for
this
one
drinkability
like
i
said
up
there
in
the
taste
this
isnt
a
bad
or
offensive
beer
its
just
not
particularly
impressive
the
malt
profile
is
sort
of
dry
and
biscuity
the
hops
pretty
standard
cant
recommend
this
one
though
i
wont
say
its
an
avoid
not
bad
decent
ipa
with
a
moderate
hop
bite
but
nothing
that
really
made
it
stand
out
still
quite
drinkable
though
drinkability
if
this
was
more
readily
available
to
me
id
probably
pick
it
up
fairly
often
despite
being
more
malty
than
most
ipas
it
makes
this
beer
particularly
well
balanced
and
i
like
it
i
can
see
where
this
is
called
kashmir
because
it
is
so
smooth
delicate
and
soft
in
the
mouthfeel
very
easily
drinkable
taste
is
standard
ipa
fare
thats
not
a
bad
thing
doesnt
stand
out
from
the
crowd
but
id
never
mind
standing
around
the
backyard
grill
with
one
in
my
hand
picked
this
one
up
at
brawleys
beverage
in
nc
pours
a
goldenorange
color
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
with
some
retention
first
scent
i
got
was
malty
followed
by
light
floral
hopping
malts
are
present
in
the
flavor
as
well
and
hops
are
perhaps
a
bit
light
for
an
ipa
but
theres
at
least
more
of
a
crisp
bitter
grapefruit
hoppy
taste
than
the
aroma
would
indicate
which
is
a
good
thing
i
thought
their
pale
ale
was
a
bit
underhopped
as
well
anyways
not
a
top
shelf
ipa
but
certainly
drinkable
overall
a
nice
american
ipa
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
still
enjoyable
drinkability
glad
i
was
able
to
be
talked
into
a
growler
as
my
first
impressions
are
very
impressive
for
an
ipa
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
matches
well
with
a
flavorful
pizza
d
i
love
ipas
and
pizza
going
to
preheat
the
oven
now
with
great
smoothness
mellow
drinkability
and
plenty
of
hop
bite
kashmir
ipa
is
easily
my
favorite
offering
so
far
from
highland
outstanding
d
great
drinkability
wondefully
hoppy
i
think
i
had
like
3
of
these
no
i
did
not
drive
my
sister
was
there
too
and
enjoyed
one
would
love
to
drink
again
and
again
finish
is
the
only
thing
that
keeps
me
from
sessioning
this
beer
i
could
drink
1
maybe
2
but
would
be
easily
ready
to
move
on
to
another
beer
after
pours
a
dark
golden
with
a
nice
rocky
head
that
fades
to
a
cap
and
leaves
some
decent
lacing
smells
light
minerally
and
a
bit
bready
as
well
the
taste
is
also
quite
bready
and
there
is
a
lingering
earthy
bitterness
that
is
almost
metallic
but
fairly
pleasant
this
combines
well
with
the
deep
breadiness
pretty
pleasant
but
maybe
a
little
heavy
for
a
session
beer
there
are
some
developing
waxy
citrus
notes
as
well
that
i
like
im
reviewing
this
in
the
bottle
but
i
think
this
is
particularly
good
on
cask
this
would
be
a
great
beer
on
cask
more
drinkable
at
the
warmer
cellar
temperature
enjoyed
this
one
a
great
deal
and
noticed
that
theres
a
little
west
coast
in
the
carolinas
nice
ipa
d
goes
down
easy
md
medium
bodied
and
a
good
level
of
carbonation
a
good
ipa
but
nothing
spectacular
not
bad
quite
a
solid
single
ipa
notes
thanks
to
loki
for
this
one
my
first
nc
brew
very
very
well
crafted
brew
that
surprised
me
with
how
hoppy
it
was
this
would
be
an
excellent
session
brew
even
with
the
bite
taste
hits
first
with
the
hops
good
piney
elements
malt
and
sweetness
kicks
in
later
i
had
this
on
tap
at
brixx
woodfired
pizza
in
raleigh
it
was
hazy
and
golden
straw
colored
with
a
thin
creamy
foam
the
aroma
is
hoppy
and
a
little
newly
cut
grass
the
taste
was
caramelly
malt
and
bitterness
especially
in
the
aftertaste
the
bitterness
is
what
stuck
with
me
from
this
beer
drinkability
is
ok
it
was
definitely
good
with
a
pizza
highland
hasnt
really
put
out
anything
displeasing
to
my
palate
i
would
drink
this
if
it
was
local
thanks
to
muenchenerkindl
for
this
one
it
pours
a
cloudy
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
fluffy
quarter
inch
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
pine
resin
and
grapefruit
the
taste
begins
with
pine
then
shifts
toward
grapefruit
and
a
lingering
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
ipa
it
is
easily
drinkable
but
it
doesnt
wow
me
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
great
drinkability
all
this
flavor
with
only
5

abv
i
smell
a
session
beer
stood
up
to
and
paired
well
with
some
spicy
fajitas
color
is
a
typical
but
appetizing
coppery
amber
somewhat
cloudy
aroma
is
rich
and
strongly
hoppy
with
a
malty
undertone
flavor
is
rich
and
very
hoppy
but
not
too
bitter
very
satisfying
this
is
one
sassy
and
jazzy
ipa
not
superb
but
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
like
hoppy
beers
this
was
a
good
ipa
overall
i
liked
it
but
didnt
love
it
its
basic
but
gets
the
job
done
another
nice
highland
brew
d
this
is
an
approachable
ipa
with
tempered
bitterness
it
wont
blow
your
socks
off
but
is
a
nice
tasty
brew
pretty
weak
effort
im
afraid
unfortunately
i
have
three
more
to
finish
off
maybe
im
spoiled
by
easy
access
to
sweetwaters
ipa
which
is
really
really
good
and
not
even
that
expensive
but
i
wont
be
buying
the
highland
kashmir
ipa
again
d
the
aroma
was
lacking
and
i
prefer
much
more
citrus
in
an
ipa
otherwise
it
was
decent
fairly
drinkable
pours
a
semi
hazy
bright
light
orange
with
a
diminishing
head
smell
is
bland
and
light
citrusy
malt
with
no
real
hop
presence
to
speak
of
taste
is
thin
with
a
watery
hop
flavor
and
some
orange
citrusy
characteristics
nice
moderate
bitterness
and
more
hop
flavor
in
the
taste
than
in
the
smell
at
least
still
something
kind
of
dusty
musty
and
odd
about
this
as
if
it
has
an
almost
mold
flavor
drinkable
overall
not
my
favorite
ipa
but
the
taste
is
quite
fetching
and
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
highland
exhibits
a
high
level
of
quality
across
the
board
this
poured
dark
amber
with
a
little
head
it
had
the
scent
of
yeast
and
light
hops
it
had
a
smooth
flavor
of
yeast
and
moderate
citrus
hops
it
wasnt
very
bitter
and
had
a
fairly
weak
aftertaste
but
i
still
really
liked
it
maybe
it
was
just
my
mood
that
day
as
i
typically
prefer
the
stronger
and
more
flavorful
beers
but
sometimes
its
nice
to
have
something
a
little
more
simple
for
a
change
of
pace
to
give
your
palette
a
rest
pours
a
clear
amber
medium
sized
white
head

leaves
behind
some
solid
lace
spots
thin
ring
sticks
around
the
glass
smell
is
nice
vanilla
and
caramel
big
citrus
and
grapefruit
middle
oats
cereal
very
fruity
some
brown
sugar
pretty
unique
aroma
taste
is
lots
of
grapefruit
very
sugary
middle
vanilla
and
caramel
malty
biscuits
almost
woody
floral
finish
solid
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
medium
carbonation
quite
nice
not
my
favourite
ipa
but
i
found
this
pretty
unique
for
the
style
thanks
for
sharing
russ
drinkability
is
good
well
balanced
and
interesting
seems
to
lean
more
towards
being
an
english
ipa
than
an
american
but
nice
this
was
drinkable
but
not
stellar
a
good
ipa
the
aroma
is
not
hoppy
its
more
on
the
spicey
characteristic
the
appearance
is
cloudy
yellow
with
dot
bubbles
the
taste
is
well
balanced
and
rather
chai
saisonlike
its
bitter
and
more
offset
by
spiceyyeastness
than
by
the
normal
sweetness
nicely
done
change
of
pace
d
this
is
not
extreme
in
the
least
could
easily
be
sessioned
but
there
is
definitely
other
things
i
would
pick
first
d
pretty
good
ipa
but
it
drinks
more
like
a
hoppedup
esb
with
sweet
caramel
malt
base
and
floralperfumy
hop
characteristics
i
prefer
more
of
a
citrus
or
piney
hop
profile
in
an
ipa
but
this
is
still
pretty
tasty
overall
not
too
bad
overall
if
you
like
you
ipas
malty
this
one
is
more
about
the
malt
than
the
hops
not
too
bad
overall
but
does
not
rank
up
with
my
top
ipas
hazy
gold
with
a
thin
head
that
lacked
motivation
or
direction
aromas
of
faintest
citrus
oils
the
flavor
was
the
shocker
i
just
couldnt
taste
that
much
there
was
some
hop
bitterness
and
even
the
moaning
ghost
of
citrus
herbal
hop
character
but
it
tasted
locked
away
and
submerged
beneath
the
bubbles
a
little
toasty
malt
rounds
it
out
but
im
missing
the
ipa
part
here
unless
this
one
has
already
been
on
a
sailing
vessel
all
the
way
to
india
and
back
to
north
carolina
where
your
notsohumble
hoss
sits
sipping
this
i
even
smelled
my
clean
shirt
i
put
on
a
few
hours
ago
after
a
shower
and
it
has
more
going
than
this
beer
medium
body
bitter
finish
i
can
drink
this
fine
but
i
wouldnt
pay
for
it
if
it
was
your
homebrew
i
would
gladly
have
one
whenever
i
came
over
ill
try
one
more
in
a
couple
days
and
get
back
to
you
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
with
an
ample
white
head
that
laces
and
holds
nicely
the
smell
is
of
toasty
biscuit
like
and
staw
like
with
an
interplay
of
citrus
and
spicy
hops
the
taste
is
up
front
with
the
hops
as
would
be
expected
but
the
malt
characteristics
also
have
a
significant
role
here
this
is
certainly
not
quite
as
assertive
of
an
ipa
in
the
flavor
department
as
would
be
desired
for
an
american
ipa
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
appropriately
medium
bodied
overall
a
good
ipa
this
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
but
i
would
never
say
no
to
it
overall
this
is
a
very
good
ipa
and
its
from
my
home
state
to
boot
i
really
liked
the
floral
hoppiness
and
the
nice
lingering
without
overdoing
the
bitterness
the
color
and
aroma
can
really
throw
you
you
wouldnt
expect
this
kind
of
robust
flavor
coming
out
like
it
does
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
brew
poured
into
a
pint
glass
scorpion
a
nice
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
small
creamy
offwhite
head
which
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
more
on
the
malt
side
but
a
nice
little
touch
of
hops
slight
citrus
not
much
pineyness
at
all
the
taste
is
malty
some
hoppiness
really
not
much
citrus
or
pines
in
this
one
medium
body
drinkable
i
like
this
one
but
not
what
i
would
look
for
in
an
ipa
12
oz
with
no
freshness
date
the
beer
is
a
clouded
medium
gold
with
ample
carbonation
that
leads
up
to
two
fingers
of
light
tan
head
that
provides
tons
of
lacing
the
aroma
consists
of
mild
toasted
malts
american
hops
and
some
heat
but
is
pretty
weak
lots
of
bitterness
on
the
palate
from
the
piney
citric
and
perfumyspicy
hops
on
top
of
a
really
dry
medium
body
that
is
a
bit
tingly
and
leaves
a
long
finish
overall
a
nice
drinkable
ipa
but
nothing
earthshattering
overall
a
very
pleasurable
pint
not
exemplary
but
a
quality
brew
i
would
buy
another
six
of
any
day
pours
a
hazy
brownish
orange
color
quickly
vanishing
head
with
plenty
of
lacing
left
behind
the
aroma
is
a
floral
and
citrus
hops
with
some
maltiness
in
the
background
the
taste
is
citrus
with
a
far
amount
of
bitterness
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
hops
and
somewhat
astringent
this
is
a
decent
ipa
but
slightly
lower
in
hop
kick
than
many
ipas
drinkability
decent
drinkability
ipas
are
not
my
usual
but
this
one
is
not
bad
well
if
youre
after
a
real
piney
citrus
bomb
this
is
it
kashmir
evokes
a
kind
of
exotic
twist
on
the
style
of
the
beer
and
they
went
for
it
unfortunately
to
me
it
felt
like
the
brewers
emphasis
on
the
aggressive
pine
flavors
threw
the
beer
off
balance
and
made
it
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
drink
it
wasnt
a
terrible
experience
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
beer
again
highland
brews
some
good
beers
but
this
isnt
a
high
point
in
their
catalog
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
and
enjoyable
beer
as
a
session
beer
or
just
as
a
stand
alone
this
is
a
great
offering
and
is
a
great
representation
of
style
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
higland
offering
to
date
but
i
do
have
a
few
more
to
try
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head

quickly
dissipating
the
aroma
is
of
hops
with
an
undertone
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
malty
and
hoppy
all
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
bitterness
that
lingers
after
tasting
great
flavor
balance
in
this
ipa
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
touch
of
creaminess
overall
this
may
not
be
the
boldest
ipa
but
it
is
quite
drinkable
overall
a
major
disappointment
one
doesnt
expect
super
sweet
grainy
flavors
to
dominate
in
an
ipa
but
thats
exactly
what
you
have
here
highland
makes
some
decent
beers
in
my
opinion
this
isnt
one
of
them
skip
this
one
and
try
something
else
in
their
lineup
drinkability
nothing
spectacular
but
easy
enough
to
drink
a
handful
d
i
would
gladly
have
another
bottle
or
two
of
this
the
drink
goes
down
easy
and
adds
bigger
flavor
kicks
at
all
the
right
spots

i

myself
picking
up

time

very
similar
to

hazed

above

thin

here
much
more
so
than
the
dry
hopped
pale

some
citrus
and
floral

nose
but
not
that
impressive
some
fruity
notes
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
make
their
presence
known
as
well

is
pretty
much
grapefruit
pith
and
floral
perfume
tones
an
astringent
bitterness
lacquers
the
palate
from
the
first
sip
to
the
finish
a
touch
of
balancing
malt
sugars
provide
enough
sweetness
to
make
this
tolerable
but
this
brew
comes
off
one
dimensional
same
flavor
aspect
working
over
and
over
again
mouthfeel
is
oily
carbonatin
is
sturdy
and
tickles
the
back
of
the
throat
definitely
medium
bodied
some
protein
filled
thickness
is
definitely
welcomed
in
the
texture
drinkability
is
so
so
im
not
a
fan
of
the
one
dimensional
hop
bitterness
ipa
that
lacks
in
hop
flavor
im
a
hophead
but
i
like
to
see
balance
and
harmony
in
the
combonation
of
malts
marrying
hops
that
doesnt
go
down
here
very
good
light
ipa
could
use
more
hops
but
a
pleasant
summer
sipper
nonetheless
drinks
pretty
easy
kind
of
tame
for
a
aipa
though
but
solid
none
the
less
thanks
to
meechum
for
the
extra
in
a
trade
overall
for
my
first
try
at
ipas
i
think
this
was
a
great
one
to
try
another
good
offering
from
highland
brewing
i
have
yet
to
meet
a
beer
of
theirs
i
didnt
like
pours
a
nice
hazy
dark
golden
with
a
one
finger
head
nice
retention
and
sticky
lacing
aroma
is
very
nice
blend
of
malts
and
citrus
hops
taste
is
citrus
malts
and
sweet
malts
without
a
bad
bitterness
very
easy
drinking
ipa
which
is
exactly
what
i
like
if
i
lived
in
asheville
this
would
easily
be
a
goto
beer
and
that
would
be
great
very
nice
ipa
this
is
on
tap
all
overt
he
place
in
western
north
carolina
but
i
had
it
at
bele
chere
and
cannot
believe
i
havent
reviewed
this
before
been
drinking
it
for
a
long
time
i
guess
i
just
never
got
around
to
typing
up
the
review
so
anyway
here
it
goes
poured
a
nice
golden
amber
a
touch
hazy
with
good
visible
carbonation
nice
two
inch
head
slowly
faded
away
to
just
a
layer
of
lace
on
the
top
decent
side
lace
on
the
glass
as
well
looks
like
a
good
ipa
smell
was
very
sweet
and
hoppy
lots
of
orange
and
tangerine
but
a
definate
malty
back
was
apparent
and
was
obviously
present
the
taste
is
great
a
nice
light
hoppy
ipa
a
touch
sticky
with
a
good
bitter
dry
aftertaste
first
flavors
that
come
through
are
nice
fresh
citrus
followed
by
a
touch
of
sugar
and
a
yeasty
bread
flavor
that
is
lingering
around
in
the
back
very
well
balanced
a
nice
smooth
drink
good
carbonation
and
easy
drinker
this
is
a
definate
classic
session
ipa
i
could
really
drink
this
all
night
long
one
of
my
favorite
local
ipas
and
a
good
representation
of
the
quality
brewing
going
on
around
here
if
you
gcan
get
it
go
for
its
a
definate
winner
if
you
cant
get
it
give
me
a
shout
i
will
send
ya
some
orange
with
a
soapy
white
head
that
leaves
a
touch
of
lacing
on
the
glass
that
quickly
runs
back
down
the
taste
is
initially
very
good
with
hop
oils
seeming
to
jump
onto
my
tongue
a
little
bitterness
in
the
after
taste
and
just
plain
delicious
i
get
so
partial
to
hop
bombs
that
i
sometimes
overlook
nice
balanced
ipas
such
as
this
one
however
as
it
warmed
it
was
not
so
good
the
mouthfeel
is
chewy
ok
stuff
but
i
might
not
make
a
second
purchase
d
excellent
i
had
a
six
pack
when
i
came
back
from
the
store
yesterday
and
now
i
have
one
left
this
could
become
my
goto
ipa
so
good
but
not
too
strong
or
hoppy
so
that
you
can
drink
several
and
be
fine
even
want
more
cheers
md
lightmedium
bodied
maybe
a
touch
heavy
on
the
carbonation
probably
about
average
drinkability
not
enough
balance
drinkability
one
can
easily
polish
off
3
or
4
at
a
sitting
a
decent
beer
but
i
wouldnt
go
looking
out
for
it
in
the
future
kashmir
is
an
extremely
rewarding
and
sensible
ale
that
steers
clearly
toward
well
balanced
and
bolder
english
ales
than
the
more
common
american
examples
highlands
flagship
ipa
will
be
well
received
in
the
central
kentucky
market
this
one
to
me
is
a
lighter
ipa
that
doesnt
qualify
as
the
best
or
even
close
but
good
for
certain
reasons
appearance
is
light
golden
with
a
medium
sized
head
and
steady
carbonation
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
as
well
smell
is
faint
of
hops
more
on
the
floral
side
with
a
little
citrus
i
enjoy
the
taste
of
this
beer
crisp
fresh
hops
and
a
tiny
malt
backbone
more
on
the
hop
side
but
they
arent
overpowering
or
intense
by
any
means
soft
and
delicate
with
a
light
biscuit
essence
underneath
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
but
quite
refreshing
and
the
carbonation
is
damn
near
perfect
less
bitterness
than
your
typical
drinkability
is
great
and
this
one
goes
down
as
an
excellent
session
ipa
lower
abv
and
pretty
good
stats
in
other
areas
affordable
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
i
consider
this
a
safe
ipa
if
you
have
somebody
who
has
yet
to
delve
into
that
type
of
beer
its
much
less
aggressive
and
bold
than
the
usual
but
still
very
lovely
d
this
one
has
been
growing
on
me
i
was
put
off
by
the
sweetness
at
first
but
this
is
an
interesting
brew
not
outstanding
but
interesting
thanks
for
sending
this
my
way

bday
07
dark
gold
color
almost
no
head
and
a
little
bit
of
sticky
lacing
smell
is
faintly
citrus
and
maybe
some
banana
and
peach
and
floral
hops
odors
taste
is
very
mild
for
an
ipa
up
front
some
cirtrus
hops
but
mostly
caramel
malts
and
some
buttery
notes
this
one
finishes
with
an
unpleasant
blast
of
bitterness
faintly
piney
but
mostly
just
bitter
i
wish
the
hops
had
more
of
a
presence
up
front
and
that
it
had
more
of
the
desirable
bitter
citrus
or
pine
to
it
but
it
just
finishes
harsh
this
one
is
really
hard
to
get
a
handle
on
my
first
impression
was
to
lightly
hopped
to
be
an
ipa
and
really
more
of
a
pale
ale
and
actually
a
nice
one
on
first
impression
but
then
the
finish
hits
you
with
the
blast
ill
finish
the
one
im
drinking
but
this
one
has
a
long
way
to
go
to
compete
with
the
big
boys
overall
a
great
ipa
has
many
of
the
characteristics
i
look
for
in
an
ipa
recommended
taste
was
quite
unexpected
and
hard
to
nail
down
a
bit
too
fruity
and
sweet
for
an
ipa
with
hops
left
to
the
backburners
and
by
backburner
i
mean
aftertaste
to
which
the
hops
were
aplenty
smooth
feel
across
the
tongue
and
a
good
level
of
carbonation
i
cant
say
that
id
buy
this
ever
in
stores
but
it
was
an
interesting
try
pours
a
crisp
pale
orange
with
a
thin
head
that
was
slightly
diminishing
the
aroma
was
of
mild
hops
with
a
slight
malt
backbone
the
taste
was
of
both
citrus
and
pine
hops
balanced
nicely
with
pale
malts
this
beer
is
light
on
the
palate
and
the
hop
blend
is
nice
and
refreshing
to
any
hophead
without
being
aggressive
at
all
for
an
ipa
that
is
only
5
6
this
one
is
very
enjoyable
poured
a
hazy
light
golden
color
with
suspended
particles
brightwhite
head
fades
quickly
but
leaves
behind
a
ring
and
a
few
swirls
hardly
any
rising
bubbles
very
low
nose
on
this
most
of
the
smells
im
picking
up
are
malty
and
like
caramel
first
taste
is
sweeter
caramel
malts
and
a
faint
grassy
hop
flavor
way
in
the
back
light
bitterness
and
kinda
mild
for
an
ipa
tastes
almost
like
an
amber
or
a
standard
micro
pale
ale
medium
bodied
and
low
bubbly
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
alright
to
drink
a
bunch
of
in
an
evening
without
getting
yourself
into
trouble
rich
bronze
in
color
with
a
nice
foam
head
and
good
retention
the
smell
is
of
hops
though
more
mellow
than
a
typical
ipa
the
taste
is
hoppy
as
one
would
expect
but
again
quite
mellow
very
smooth
in
the
finish
with
just
a
small
bit
of
bitterness
slightly
creamy
in
the
mouth
very
easy
going
down
incredibly
drinkable
and
would
make
a
fantastic
session
ale
because
the
bitterness
is
toned
down
and
its
an
incredibly
smooth
concoction
nothing
will
jump
out
and
wow
you
but
you
could
easily
find
yourself
drinking
many
of
these
in
a
sitting
all
in
all
a
good
beer
especially
for
one
made
in
the
old
south
d
it
is
a
easy
drinking
ipa
pretty
simple
all
the
way
round
no
strong
flavors
helps
for
easy
drinking
nothing
special
but
not
bad
d
this
isnt
a
very
flavorful
beer
nor
does
it
go
down
too
easy
its
not
very
filling
which
is
about
the
only
compliment
i
can
give
to
it
im
quite
surprised
since
i
liked
highlands
gaelic
ale
so
much
that
didnt
like
this
beer
at
all
d
after
enjoying
a
half
glass
i
dove
into
dinner
it
went
great
with
really
spicy
mexican
and
was
not
a
heavy
hitting
brew
easy
to
enjoy
a
couple
of
dinner
and
feel
good
mellow
and
not
in
your
face
but
flavorful
and
aromatic
this
is
an
excellent
session
ipa
if
i
ever
had
one
more
characteristics
of
an
ipa
brewed
across
the
pond
so
to
speak
than
right
here
in
nc
i
wont
be
overlooking
this
one
anymore
decent
level
of
carbonation
and
mediumbodied
very
refreshing
and
somewhat
crisp
a
bit
creamy
and
highly
drinkable
thanks
again
to
northerntimber
for
this
one
single
bottle
from
wf
raleigh
no
dating
on
the
label
or
bottle
highland
needs
to
get
on
that
round
even
taste
with
broad
hop
flavors
and
healthy
ripples
of
bitter
aftertaste
carbonation
is
slightly
overdone
but
not
too
bad
and
balance
could
use
some
tweaking
but
for
the
style
this
is
flavorful
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
stiff
enough
to
hold
up
the
hops
i
wouldnt
go
far
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
but
its
a
solid
enough
effort
alright
let
me
begin
by
saying
i
believe
that
this
has
been
lightstruck
or
been
otherwise
made
defective
i
didnt
smell
or
taste
bad
however
it
really
had
no
smell
and
very
very
little
flavour
it
poured
a
medium
yellow
with
a
big
beautiful
fluffy
snow
white
cap
that
stayed
for
ages
it
looked
wonderful
however
there
was
no
smell
nothing
like
smelling
a
glass
of
water
the
taste
too
was
almost
nonexistant
just
a
tiny
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
as
i
looked
at
it
there
were
1000s
of
tiny
particles
suspended
and
floating
about
in
the
beer
i
thought
at
first
they
must
be
bubbles
but
upon
further
inspection
they
were
clearly
matter
of
some
sort
ill
let
tonights
review
of
this
stand
but
i
would
like
to
review
this
again
in
the
future
with
a
fresher
example
everything
else
was
fantastic
especially
the
appearance
overall
very
drinkable
while
not
the
best
ive
had
in
this
style
certainly
a
worthy
beer
and
worth
trying
medium
bodied
with
a
mild
hoppy
tingly
texture
overall
not
a
great
example
of
the
ipa
style
i
might
try
this
again
just
to
give
it
a
second
chance
but
it
did
not
impress
me
on
the
first
go
around
cloudy
bronze
toped
with
a
short
dense
head
of
fine
offwhite
bubbles
that
slowly
settles
leaving
no
lacing
there
is
a
steady
pulsating
wall
of
carbonation
fruity
sweet
tart
nose
with
orange
blossom
and
rind
coming
through
starts
with
a
modest
hop
bite
orange
rind
with
perhaps
a
bit
of
sugar
that
builds
solid
malt
body
throughout
but
the
finish
is
short
and
to
the
point
and
filled
with
more
of
those
rind
notes
that
do
not
linger
there
is
perhaps
a
touch
of
pine
and
grapefruit
but
the
hop
profile
is
not
overly
aggressive
and
seems
to
be
missing
its
snap
medium
body
with
minimal
carbonation
that
is
extremely
fine
soft
and
smooth
and
just
a
touch
on
the
thin
side
the
label
reads
a
bold
beer
best
consumed
with
a
stiff
upper
lip
your
lip
doesnt
have
to
be
too
stiff
as
this
one
lacked
significant
punch
a
nice
beer
from
highland
i
generally
enjoy
their
beers
in
my
opinion
the
gaelic
ale
has
more
of
an
ipa
feel
to
it
than
this
kashmir
both
are
quite
enjoyable
so
ill
let
you
decide
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
medium
orange
color
with
half
a
finger
of
head
that
dies
off
quickly
there
is
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
fruity
with
a
good
amount
of
citrusy
hops
lots
of
pineapple
in
there
with
orange
and
even
some
floral
notes
the
taste
has
lots
of
hop
bitterness
going
on
its
juicy
hop
flavor
at
first
but
gets
a
little
bit
on
the
harsh
bitterness
side
on
the
finish
i
seem
to
be
detecting
a
bit
of
diacetyl
in
there
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
decently
thick
and
heavy
the
drinkability
is
just
ok
due
to
the
harshness
and
diacetyl
its
ok
12
oz
bottle
6
oz
pour
beer
is
a
light
orange
color
with
a
light
head
that
sits
as
a
floating
island
over
the
brew
clarity
is
moderate
and
only
a
small
stream
of
bubbles
is
apparent
nose
is
moderately
caramel
lightly
bready
and
a
little
earthy
no
real
bright
citrusy
hop
is
hitting
me
which
i
would
like
to
find
in
my
ipa
flavor
is
representative
of
the
nose
caramel
earthy
hoppy
flavors
light
breadyness
it
finishes
with
a
mild
citrusy
hop
flavor
and
a
moderate
peppery
bitterness
that
hangs
on
nicely
after
swallowing
the
brew
not
bad
feel
is
moderate
with
a
moderte
carbonation
that
breaks
things
up
nicely
keeping
it
from
being
too
heavy
overall
this
brew
is
not
giving
me
what
i
want
from
my
ipas
but
its
not
bad
id
like
to
see
what
this
one
is
like
fresh
and
on
draft
i
have
a
feeling
that
there
is
more
brilliance
to
be
found
in
this
one
id
like
to
have
it
again
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
bout
a
fingers
worth
of
offwhite
head
leaves
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
spicy
orange
and
cedar
hop
scent
flavor
is
surprising
malt
comes
through
more
than
expected
spicy
bite
from
the
hops
with
a
bitter
finish
enjoying
the
sweet
malt
and
zesty
citrus
combo
mouthfeel
is
very
good
medium
body
thats
a
tad
slick
from
the
hop
oils
and
good
carbonation
i
could
see
my
self
having
a
few
of
these
on
a
lazy
afternoon
light
and
drinkable
but
i
did
not
find
this
one
enjoyable
there
are
too
many
other
ipas
out
there
for
a
similar
price
for
me
to
be
sampling
this
one
again
anytime
soon
i
was
disappointed
because
i
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
every
other
highland
brew
ive
sampled
back
to
the
drawing
board
on
this
one
boys
an
india
pale
ale
for
senior
citizen
bingo
night
seriously
this
is
one
weak
ass
ipa
the
flavor
consists
of
an
earthy
herbal
and
grassy
hop
profile
with
a
slight
note
of
citrus
and
a
boring
bready
grainy
malt
backbone
thin
mouthfeel
forgettable
drinkability

im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
ipas
but
i
found
this
one
to
be
good
it
is
my
least
favorite
of
all
the
highlands
beers
which
i
dearly
love
but
that
is
due
to
style
and
not
quality
bottle
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
billowy
white
head
has
a
wheaty
nose
and
not
much
florality
interesting
mix
of
fruit
and
hops
on
the
palate
a
very
light
ipa
with
an
interesting
taste
not
a
hopheads
dream
but
enjoyable
i
think
thanks
derrick
for
the
bottle
clear
golden
color
with
a
large
sticky
white
head
awsome
head
retention
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
hoppy
i
can
definately
detect
the
spicy
english
hops
and
at
the
same
time
the
mt
hoods
pull
through
with
their
pine
aroma
the
flavor
is
about
the
same
a
well
balanced
hoppy
brew
the
hops
are
a
tasty
mix
of
english
raw
leafiness
and
mt
hood
sharpness
a
sweet
malt
and
light
toasted
grain
balance
out
the
hops
the
drinkability
is
dangerous
pint
after
pint
can
be
consumed
if
you
dont
have
anything
to
do
the
next
day
i
think
my
taste
have
matured
since
the
last
time
i
tried
this
beer
i
love
it
very
very
drinkable
and
highly
recommended
to
anyone
who
can
get
their
hands
on
this
as
much
as
i
was
recently
disappointed
by
the
über
pils
from
clipper
city
another
excellent
regional
brewer
if
it
had
tasted
like
this
i
would
have
been
overjoyed
this
is
not
your
typical
pinencitrus
american
ipa
but
it
is
an
excellent
showcase
for
bold
hop
flavoring
also
again
proof
that
a
big
flavorful
beer
doesnt
have
to
be
high
in
alchohol
this
ones
only
5
6
but
youd
never
know
it
from
the
taste
this
beer
poured
differently
than
i
expected
it
was
a
very
light
yellow
color
only
slightly
darker
than
a
macro
brew
beer
the
head
was
very
thin
white
color
and
had
a
slight
lacing
around
the
glass
it
had
a
mild
hopy
smell
much
less
strong
than
my
normal
perception
of
an
ipa
it
was
mild
for
an
ipa
overall
and
lad
a
nice
hopy
finishes
with
a
bitter
after
taste
i
am
not
normally
a
huge
fan
of
an
ipa
but
this
reminded
me
of
a
pale
ale
more
than
an
ipa
and
that
is
probably
why
i
enjoyed
this
so
much
it
really
makes
me
want
to
try
their
pale
if
you
are
not
a
huge
fan
of
ipas
this
might
be
the
first
step
to
enjoying
them
if
you
like
sierra
nevada
or
highly
hoped
pale
ales
give
this
a
try
easy
to
drink
easy
to
like
hard
to
love
its
got
no
real
selling
points
against
many
other
better
ipas
i
much
prefer
highlands
gaelic
ale
over
this
i
was
surprised
to
learn
that
until
the
drinkability
score
of
this
beer
i
had
given
nothing
but
4
0s
to
the
three
highland
brewing
company
beers
that
ive
been
fortunate
enough
to
drink
the
accolades
have
been
well
deserved
kashmir
ipa
is
a
keeper
thanks
to
wolfgang
for
sending
it
my
way
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
from
highland
it
poured
out
into
a
highland
pint
glass
with
a
minimal
head
it
is
a
amber
color
with
a
large
amount
of
floaters
it
has
a
hoppy
bitter
smell
it
tastes
like
it
smells
hoppy
and
bitter
it
has
somewhat
of
a
bite
but
not
enough
to
distract
from
the
overall
impression
too
much
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
affected
but
overall
a
decent
brew
i
could
drink
these
again
if
your
not
crazy
about
hoppy
beers
this
would
be
great
ipa
for
you
if
you
are
a
hophead
there
is
better
options
out
there
last
swigs
well
balanced
orange
and
lolipop
malts
well
built
enjoyable
ipa
not
a
ballsout
no
holds
barred
ipa
went
well
with
pizza
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
34
white
head
above
the
dark
straw
brew
head
is
foamy
and
lasting
with
average
to
good
lacing
aroma
is
lightly
of
pale
malts
with
some
hops
input
but
not
as
much
as
i
would
hope
for
taste
starts
with
some
pale
malts
as
well
which
are
quickly
overpowered
by
hops
bitterness
the
hops
character
in
the
flavor
is
somewhat
generic
but
tending
towards
pine
and
not
so
much
the
fruity
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
making
the
bitterness
more
palatable
and
as
such
drinkability
is
good
as
well
reasonably
standard
american
ipa
for
better
or
worse
not
an
uber
bitter
ipa
but
packed
with
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
easy
to
drink
and
good
to
relax
yourself
right
before
bed
a
great
example
where
the
first
taste
to
last
taste
have
exactly
the
opposite
effect
at
first
i
said
wow
this
tastes
great
what
kind
of
style
is
this
malty
brew
after
a
few
more
sips
and
relaization
this
is
an
ipa
things
really
changed
chewy
mouthfeel
with
no
real
hoppiness
for
the
style
okay
appearance
of
a
thick
head
and
nice
carbonation
one
of
my
least
favorite
ipas
12
ounce
bottle
no
freshness
dating
drinkability
is
above
average
as
i
could
easily
enjoy
many
pints
of
this
brew
my
first
beer
from
highland
and
i
like
it
really
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
between
the
hops
and
malts
hops
present
themself
as
slightly
floral
with
some
fleeting
resin
flavors
a
good
malt
sweetness
as
well
nice
and
light
and
tasty
mouthfeel
is
okay
a
bit
thin
drinkability
is
good
though
due
to
the
lighter
flavor
profile
and
the
good
balance
this
is
a
quite
confusing
beer
an
ipa
really
it
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
color
with
a
pearl
white
head
that
leaves
spidery
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
pure
pilsner
a
spicy
saaz
hops
smell
with
a
bready
malt
background
from
the
looks
and
smell
it
could
only
be
a
pilsner
the
taste
is
somewhat
like
a
pilsner
starts
with
a
breadlike
biscuity
malt
and
leads
into
a
hoppy
spicy
and
slightly
bitter
taste
and
finishes
dry
bitter
and
crisp
i
can
hardly
believe
this
is
an
ale
much
less
an
ipa
its
hoppy
but
this
is
definately
a
pilsner
style
beer
if
it
were
labeled
a
pilsner
or
even
a
lager
i
would
consider
this
a
quality
brew
even
great
but
this
appears
to
be
the
victim
of
sever
mislabeling
not
bad
by
any
stretch
but
most
definaetly
not
an
ipa
so
be
forwarned
a
nice
complex
hoppy
brew
but
not
really
an
ipa
this
is
a
wellbalanced
beer
that
just
doesnt
live
up
to
its
ultradryhopped
west
coast
bretheren
theyve
been
around
since
1994
and
must
be
doing
something
right
bright
gold
color
with
a
nice
white
fluffy
head
with
lacing
down
the
glass
herbal
hoppy
aroma
flavor
dominated
by
hops
with
some
malt
to
balance
hops
roll
on
the
tongue
during
the
aftertaste
nicely
done
aipa
not
massively
flavored
but
a
good
straight
forward
hop
accented
ale
a
very
respectable
ipa
i
will
continue
to
stick
with
sweetwater
for
everyday
drinking
but
i
would
not
hesitate
to
pick
this
one
up
again
while
not
particularly
in
keeping
with
stylistic
guidelines
this
is
still
a
fine
beer
slightly
hazy
golden
wheat
colored
beer
full
of
carbonation
small
bright
white
head
leaves
rings
of
lace
citrusy
grapefruit
hop
aroma
is
a
bit
musty
the
flavor
is
not
very
ipaish
some
mild
chewy
citrus
hops
up
front
balanced
by
some
pale
malt
that
is
kind
of
grainy
finish
is
barely
bitter
body
is
on
the
light
side
with
a
slightly
stick
mouthfeel
not
quite
bad
is
about
all
i
can
say
pours
a
very
pale
golden
color
with
a
weak
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aromas
are
a
mix
of
earthy
and
resinous
hops
that
almost
give
off
a
vegetal
note
to
it
flavors
are
an
intermingling
of
citrus
and
spicy
hop
flavors
there
is
a
slight
backing
of
malts
that
give
off
a
slight
caramel
flavor
but
for
the
most
part
they
do
not
make
themselves
present
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
but
follows
along
the
citric
hop
flavor
overall
this
is
a
fairly
simple
ipa
but
a
quenching
one
at
that
pours
a
very
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
laces
extensively
smells
of
floral
hops
and
grass
herbal
notes
and
a
distinguished
hop
aroma
taste
is
an
explosion
of
grassy
florals
with
a
mild
malt
backbone
rather
thin
bodied
with
a
slick
coating
of
resinous
hops
on
the
tongue
finishes
dry
with
a
lingering
hop
aftertaste
by
far
the
best
ipa
i
have
had
from
nc
thanks
mike
of
brawleys
beverage
charlotte
ncfor
reccomending
this
brew
this
was
extremely
pale
for
the
style
in
fact
visually
it
could
pass
for
a
pilsner
its
got
a
grassy
floral
and
peachy
hop
aroma
is
that
downright
delicious
when
you
get
in
the
flavor
the
hops
turn
almost
salty
the
body
is
too
thin
but
if
they
turned
up
this
beer
to
a
bigger
body
and
just
amped
up
the
hops
a
bit
this
would
be
an
awesome
ipa
pours
a
crystalline
clear
gold
with
a
small
wite
head
smells
weakly
citrusy
and
a
wee
bit
grassy
slight
yeast
twinge
too
tastes
nicley
sweet
and
grassy
a
scant
amount
of
resinous
pop
really
just
a
slightly
over
sweet
ipa
mouthfeel
and
drinkablility
are
ok
this
beer
doesnt
do
a
lot
to
seperate
itself
from
the
just
another
ipa
herd
pours
a
very
pale
cloudy
copper
under
a
12
finger
offwhite
head
that
settles
quickly
leaving
just
a
trace
of
lace
a
good
crisp
flowery
hops
nose
greets
the
senses
with
a
touch
of
citrus
in
the
background
yup
and
pine
too
very
prickly
somewhat
sticky
mouth
in
the
opening
smooth
sweet
malt
blends
well
with
a
lot
of
flowery
piney
hops
a
slight
espresso
bitter
emerges
in
the
finish
while
a
dry
bite
charachterizes
the
aftertaste
by
no
means
over
the
top
this
is
a
good
drinkable
brew
good
easydrinking
ipa
maybe
a
good
starter
for
someone
not
quite
ready
for
the
overthetoppers
thank
you
hustlemuscle
for
the
sample
drinkability
a
nicely
balanced
ipa
to
please
both
the
hopheads
as
well
as
those
who
want
some
sweetness
to
counter
the
bitterness
the
beer
after
serving
its
sentence
in
the
12
ounce
brown
bottle
set
in
the
glass
an
obfuscated
golden
yellow
the
head
behemothic
in
size
creamy
in
texture
and
bright
white
in
color
the
lace
forms
a
concealing
sheet
upon
the
glass
the
aroma
of
hops
sweet
malt
and
a
lime
like
crispness
greet
the
nose
with
the
start
sweet
and
rich
in
malt
top
is
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
nicely
acidic
the
hops
bountiful
and
spicy
quite
dry
and
somewhat
sweet
aftertaste
lingers
long
on
the
palate
nice
moderate
ipa
nice
on
a
hot
arizona
day
the
beer
when
poured
looked
remarkably
clear
and
pale
perhaps
a
bit
too
pale
for
the
style
the
head
was
about
an
inch
thick
and
creamy
and
hung
around
for
a
bit
leaving
good
lacing
as
the
beer
went
down
carbonation
was
medium
to
low
the
aroma
was
subdued
for
the
style
with
very
little
aggressive
hop
character
in
the
nose
the
taste
was
bright
with
typical
citricpiney
american
hop
profile
with
sweetish
caramel
malt
giving
a
chewy
toffee
taste
the
hops
were
a
bit
peppery
in
the
mid
palate
the
aftertaste
was
chalkydry
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
a
good
middle
of
the
road
ipa
which
is
a
recent
arrival
in
the
jax
in
cumming
looking
forward
to
tasting
the
other
beers
from
this
regional
brewery
light
golden
color
with
slight
amber
tint
nice
white
head
with
a
little
lacing
but
it
looks
like
it
tastes
to
light
smells
of
malt
and
light
floral
hops
not
as
aroma
intense
as
a
ipa
should
be
tastes
of
carmel
malt
light
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
dry
and
sweet
with
good
mouthfeel
just
seems
to
be
missing
the
extra
flavor
and
hop
kick
i
was
looking
for
love
this
brewerys
amber
and
porter
so
was
expecting
something
more
from
the
kashmir
pouring
produces
a
bright
white
head
but
the
light
colour
of
the
beer
was
a
bit
surprising
the
aroma
contains
a
mixture
of
malty
sweetness
and
fresh
green
hoppiness
caramel
malt
predominates
at
first
with
little
hop
flavour
coming
through
but
this
leads
to
a
light
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
the
malt
character
of
the
beer
is
a
little
too
strong
for
the
style
but
its
still
a
wellcrafted
pale
ale
with
more
flavour
and
body
than
expected
in
such
a
light
coloured
beer
easy
to
drink
would
be
a
nice
brew
on
a
hot
day
light
orangegold
with
a
frothy
head
of
white
aromas
are
all
herbalgrassy
hops
and
sweet
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
and
malty
for
an
ipa
but
the
middle
is
nice
and
bready
and
the
finish
is
herbalhoppy
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
average
drinkability
is
decent
this
is
another
interesting
ipa
from
nc
all
and
all
a
great
beer
and
an
incredible
example
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
good
brew
but
no
malt
to
be
found
anywhere
this
isnt
half
bad
im
not
big
into
the
hop
thing
but
this
one
is
still
a
good
one
for
me
its
suprisingly
refreshing
all
over
i
really
liked
the
change
in
taste
that
it
did
first
it
was
a
smooth
clean
kind
of
hoppy
taste
then
it
bursts
out
into
a
hoppeppery
rush
i
guess
that
is
what
i
liked
about
it
the
multileveled
tastes
if
i
can
like
it
then
i
am
sure
that
a
hophead
would
love
it
its
got
a
creamy
feel
to
it
so
its
real
smooth
and
covers
the
palate
all
in
all
a
good
little
brew
much
better
than
i
expected
hops
stryian

willamette
thanks
aksmokedporter
for
the
zeppelinesque
ipa
their
kashmir
ipa
is
similar
to
their
american
pale
ale
but
with
a
lighter
color
a
more
floral
than
citrusy
hop
character
to
the
nose
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
also
more
varied
and
with
about
twice
the
bitterness
although
it
doesnt
seem
quite
so
once
it
warms
a
bit
its
slightly
hazy
bottleconditioned
golden
body
is
capped
by
a
thin
head
of
creamy
brightwhite
foam
that
holds
well
maintains
a
solid
surface
covering
and
leaves
some
spotty
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
is
bright
and
fresh
with
floral
grassy
hops
over
a
sweetish
bready
malt
the
body
is
medium
with
a
very
fine
and
gently
crisp
carbonation
thats
lightly
crisp
across
the
palate
the
flavor
offers
a
solid
onetwo
punch
of
floral
and
grassy
hops
over
sweet
malt
thats
well
backed
by
bold
bitterness
it
finishes
short
and
dry
with
some
very
short
lingering
malt
and
piney
hops
that
fade
quickly
to
just
bitterness
its
well
done
and
very
drinkable
overall
a
solid
but
different
ipa
the
hoppiest
of
the
highland
offerings
this
beer
is
not
too
shabby
its
balance
comes
down
decidedly
in
favor
of
the
hops
but
who
says
thats
a
bad
thing
a
bit
thin
on
mouthfeel
but
a
very
nice
complex
novel
if
nothing
else
blend
of
hop
flavors
this
is
probably
the
best
brewery
in
nc
at
least
of
all
the
beers
i
have
had
down
here
had
the
aroma
of
a
traditional
ipa
hoppygrassyand
this
one
a
little
apple
essence
poured
nice
goldcopper
color
with
nice
rocky
head
that
stayed
awhile
taste
was
of
course
very
hoppy
and
fruity
but
pretty
well
balanced
when
in
asheville
will
get
this
when
at
barleys
i
wanna
try
on
tap
delicious
worth
pursuing
more
than
just
the
test
bottle
cheers
overall
a
very
pleasant
beer
this
seasonal
offering
from
newcastle
is
a
nice
example
an
english
style
ipa
o
i
like
this
i
think
its
a
great
session
ale
with
lots
of
great
flavors
that
is
a
nice
detour
out
of
the
sea
of
american
ipas
that
try
to
out
wallop
the
next
too
bad
its
only
around
for
a
limited
time
i
would
certainly
drink
another
i
actually
liked
it
my
sweet
tooth
picking
up
the
bits
others
dont
enjoy
body
depth
was
fine
and
the
alcohol
5
2
abv
sat
nicely
within
the
brew
o
a
decent
english
ipa
that
gets
better
as
it
warmsprobably
my
favorite
of
their
seasonal
offerings
o
not
a
true
ipa
so
dont
go
in
expecting
that
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
have
to
come
in
with
different
expectations
next
time
to
get
a
true
feel
for
the
beer
the
taste
is
bereft
of
anything
hoppy
which
is
not
what
i
would
expect
from
an
ipa
even
the
more
subtle
english
ipa
there
is
a
dry
lingering
finish
but
all
in
all
it
tastes
like
an
esb
or
a
pale
ale
rather
than
an
ipa
it
is
drinkable
meh
not
much
of
an
ipa
and
a
pretty
boring
beer
in
general
surprisingly
malty
almost
like
regular
newky
brown
with
some
extra
grassy
notes
the
aromaflavour
are
dull
and
uninspired
though
the
most
glaring
omission
is
the
lack
of
hops
that
would
qualify
this
as
a
halfdecent
ipa
the
hint
of
grasshay
isnt
more
than
you
would
find
in
a
regular
ale
i
suppose
its
drinkable
enough
but
it
fails
as
an
ipa
give
it
a
miss
my
pour
produced
just
better
than
a
finger
of
dense
tawny
head
with
very
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
copper
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
malty
sweet
with
a
caramel
scent
and
a
light
grassy
hoppiness
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
definitely
of
caramel
on
the
tongue
finish
was
semisweet
and
easily
quaffable
it
was
tasty
but
not
sustaining
for
a
hophead
such
as
myself
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
make
winter
more
palatable
for
me
but
to
each
his
own
not
bad
not
unexpected
but
not
sustaining
either
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
bronze
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
malty
no
noticable
hops
taste
is
also
malty
sweet
caramel
not
what
i
was
expecting
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
beer
but
not
what
i
am
expecting
in
an
ipa
some
things
of
note
which
i
am
rather
neutral
toward
the
color
is
dark
for
an
ipa
but
its
just
color
there
is
a
bit
of
a
chocolate
flavor
underneath
the
caramel
maybe
that
is
not
to
style
but
it
doesnt
kill
the
beer
and
makes
it
sort
of
interesting
the
carbonation
is
low
and
the
beer
comes
across
as
softtextured
sorry
i
cant
be
more
articulat
than
that
in
my
mind
this
enhances
drinkability
but
the
sweetness
from
the
caramel
malts
diminishes
it
poured
into
a
16
oz
goblet
pours
a
dark
amber
color
looks
a
lot
like
strong
tea
a
twofinger
offwhite
head
with
tons
of
sticky
lacing
smells
of
caramel
cherries
and
other
ripe
fruity
aromas
some
nice
earthy
hop
aromas
in
there
too
taste
is
malty
fruity
and
sweet
up
front
with
a
smooth
transition
into
a
herbal
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
just
little
on
the
thin
side
but
carbonation
level
is
low
and
not
dry
at
all
overall
probably
the
best
english
ipa
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
and
complex
beer
that
i
hate
to
see
called
a
limited
edition
so
much
better
than
newcastles
flagship
brown
ale
hopefully
it
will
at
least
become
a
yearly
seasonal
brew
really
quite
a
light
body
esp
for
a
5
2
abv
feels
much
smaller
than
that
although
flavor
holds
a
touch
of
alcohol
qualities
or
features
of
what
id
expect
from
a
5
drink
this
was
my
first
ipa
and
for
me
it
served
as
an
introduction
to
the
world
of
ipas
its
not
at
all
bad
its
wellbalanced
enough
feels
fine
in
the
mouth
for
a
macro
brew
and
its
a
fine
ipa
for
someone
who
has
either
never
tried
a
hoppy
beer
or
isnt
a
particularly
big
fan
of
them
its
worth
buying
a
sixpack
on
sale
its
probably
on
clearance
at
the
grocery
store
right
now
if
youre
craving
hops
and
youre
either
on
a
budget
or
your
store
doesnt
have
anything
better
but
for
the
seasoned
drinker
dont
expect
anything
terribly
exciting
i
guess
this
is
ok
for
an
english
ipa
but
it
really
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
although
this
beer
seems
pretty
sessionable
i
could
probably
knock
down
quite
a
few
in
one
sitting
d
its
like
a
pretty
damn
decent
beer
that
is
almost
budweiser
flavored
and
its
simply
just
an
example
of
a
pretty
good
mass
produced
beer
or
more
accurately
a
seasonal
relatively
small
batched
beer
that
was
produced
in
a
massproductive
fashion
either
way
it
doesnt
suck
but
its
not
awesome
now
that
spring
is
around
the
corner
you
should
see
some
bargains
on
the
sizable
stock
of
unsold
newcastele
winter
ipa
left
in
the
warehouses
if
you
are
buying
beer
for
a
party
and
can
pick
it
up
cheap
the
value
is
decent
and
the
ale
is
reasonably
palatable
overall
d
quite
drinkable
especially
for
the
winter
when
one
seeks
a
fuller
beer
with
a
good
malt
backbone
that
provides
some
sustenance
and
a
little
extra
flavor
altogether
a
good
drinkable
beer
that
seems
to
age
despite
the
oxidation
better
than
its
american
ipa
counterparts
even
if
whats
promised
on
the
label
an
intensely
hopped
ipa
18th
century
style
doesnt
exactly
manifest
itself
in
the
glass
try
it
you
might
like
it
and
that
is
all
that
matters
try
new
stuff
life
is
too
short
not
to
well
sorry
for
the
unfair
review
here
with
the
head
cold
on
the
wain
and
all
but
hey
i
could
not
waste
a
quality
brew
just
because
i
wanted
a
couple
of
pints
now
could
i
the
taste
is
creamy
with
nutty
malt
and
woody
hops
w
mild
sweetness
and
fruity
yeast
tinges
w
subtle
raisin
and
toast
in

with
subtle
herbal
bitterness
and

qualities
overall
a
good
english
ale
w
nice
yeast
flavor
and
malt
balance
yet
too
tame
for
even
an
english
ipa
imo
but
i
liked
it
perhaps
esb
or
pale
ale
might
have
been
a
better
label
it
just
misses
the
mark
of
what
consitutes
a
standard
for
this
style
to
me
pass
it
by
buy
some
real
craft
beer
support
a
real
craft
brewer
i
would
recommend
this
is
a
gateway
beer
but
it
really
doesnt
play
well
for
drinking

pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a

smell
is

a
sugary

taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slightly
fruity
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
nothing
i
would
want
to
go
after
again
but
this
is
a
title
you
can
liken
to
most
polite
serial
killer
a
nice
session
beer
and
a
big
step
up
from
what
i
was
expecting
this
one
was
highly
drinkable
and
very
easy
to
do
so
nothing
stand
out
in
its
taste
and
the
smell
was
too
faint
but
overall
it
was
a
decent
enough
drink
for
what
it
is
defo
more
a
bitter
than
ipa
though
o
overall
it
wasnt
very
good
doubt
id
have
it
again
o
drinkable
if
unmemorable
not
what
i
normally
conjure
up
when
i
think
ipa
overall
a
very
mild
agreeable
beer
perfectly
sessionable
no
aroma
not
very
bitter
as
to
be
accepted
by
the
mainstream
hop
head
training
wheels
o
it
has
become
increasingly
apparent
to
me
that
if
im
offered
any
newcastle
beer
with
the
exception
of
their
brown
ale
i
should
politely
decline

good
beer
but
i
wouldnt
go
crazy
looking
for
it

its
more
like
a

if
you
are

this
definitely
wouldnt

ohonestly
a
pretty
tasty
brew
just
didnt
strike
me
as
being
hoppy
enough
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
were
dominated
by
the
malt
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
as
long
as
i
wasnt
looking

doesnt

creamier

the

even
as
the
metallic
earthiness
does
not
really
abate
much
at
times
it
seems
more
bready
or
biscuity
but
not
consistently
so
again
no
grassiness
nor
any
of
the
other
descriptors
common
to
the
american
ipa
keeps
up
with
the
salt

combo
as
well
as
some
light
asparagus
or
brussels
sprouts
for
contrast
soaks
into
the

well
suspect
this
would
be
more
enjoyable
with
food
than
casually
sipped
on
its
own
not
what
id
call
an
ipa
good
malt
flavor
but
lacks
hop
character
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
deep
copper
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
persists
for
a
while
before
leaving
a
moderate
amount
of
sticky
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smells
of
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
fair
bit
of
earthy
hops
and
hints
of
butterscotch
mineral
water
and
sulfur
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
caramel
butterscotch
and
brown
sugar
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
theres
a
light
bit

but
ipa
is
a
real
stretch
here
medium

with

and
a
sweet

mouthfeel
not
a
bad
english
palebrown
ale
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
but
it
takes
some
huge
balls
to
call
this
an
ipa
not
a
bad
brew
just
boring
a
good
session
brew
but
pretty
average
in
taste
enjoyed
this
beer
need
to
purchase
some
more
of
this
one
a
smooth
very
appealing
beer
all
around
emphasis
is
on
the
malt
notes
which
exude
a
pleasing
warmth
and
gentle
sweetness
very
good
overall
not
offensive
some
nice
holiday
notes
in
here
but
the
overall
watery
feeling
keeps
it
from
being
worthwhile
overall
the
winter
ipa
moniker
is
definitley
misleading
winter
warmer
maybe
or
british
mild
with
some
flair
maybe
but
im
assuming
its
brewed
for
the
masses
and
really
is
nothing
too
special
for
consumption
strongly
average
imho
winter
seasonal
beers
are
often
loaded
with
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
other
spices
for
a
holiday
like
festiveness
newcastle
winter
ipa
does
offer
any
of
that
but
this
is
still
a
good
beer
and
worthy
of
a
sample
it
could
use
a
little
more
body
but
it
is
still
a
good
tasting
beer
overall
even
if
it
doesnt
taste
anything
like
you
expect
filtered
copper
with
a
loose
white
head
that
lays
down
some
lace
mildly
herbal
with
a
woody
note
clean
bready
malt
with
a
bit
of
caramel
pretty
light
fare
which
is
what
i
expected
from
a
big
brand
not
a
bad
beer
to
empty
into
a
big
glass
and
gulp
but
more
malt
more
hops
and
more
body
would
be
needed
to
make
it
a
legitimate
english
ipa
well
i
picked
up
a
12
pack
of
this
on
a
whim
it
pours
a
clear
amber
with
an
almost
white
head
that
dissapears
in
about
45
seconds
poor
lacing
i
get
a
fruity
bouquet
spice
caramel
and
a
hint
of
hops
on
the
nose
its
a
bit
sour
with
a
little
licorice
and
toffee
on
the
palate
there
is
a
strange
maltyhoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
it
has
a
light
dry
mouthfeel
its
not
an
ipa
in
my
opinion
its
far
from
my
favorite
o
this
is
an
okay
beer
the
aroma
distracted
from
a
nice
flavor
onot
anything
great
its
ok
overall
this
is
english
ipa
is
a
rare
and
balanced
approach
to
the
over
hoppy
ipa
which
i
have
love
for
american
style
hell
i
would
drink
this
ale
year
around
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
coded
bottled
date
this
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
finger
thick
off
white
head
which
has
good
retention
there
is
little
hop
smell
with
the
most
obvious
smells
being
caramel
toffee
lots
of
malts
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
a
weird
disappointment
there
is
a
little
bitterness
but
its
not
the
hop
bitterness
i
love
you
get
the
malts
but
something
seems
different
o
a
good
example
of
the
traditional
uk
style
meh
just
not
reminiscent
of
an
ipa
i
never
liked
skunkcastle
brown
and
the
other
seasonal
offerings
are
weak
lets
give
this
a
go
poured
a
clear
amberbrown
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
this
smells
like
stale
adjunct
no
pine
or
citrus
or
fruit
just
dirt
the
taste
is
overly
harsh
and
bitter
in
fact
there
is
a
weird
flavor
here
that
i
remember
from
the
founders
and
the
summer
ale
kind
of
a
weird
dirty
earth
flavor
now
its
starting
to
taste
like
perfume
i
assume
thats
the
hops
feel
is
prickly
from
the
carbonation
not
drinkable
doesnt
taste
like
an
ipa
either
more
like
an
esb
or
english
bitter
not
nearly
enough
hop
character
to
be
an
ipa
sweet
dark
fruit
and
caramel
herbal
and
soapy
hop
character
balanced
clean
and
simple
but
the
flavors
are
faint
the
beer
is
refreshing
at
least
leaving
an
herbal
minty
taste
in
the
mouth
cheers
hmmmm
a
new
newcastle
like
the
brown
picked
up
a
six
of
this
to
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
i
get
a
nice
malt
smell
with
a
dry
hoppiness
pouring
into
a
sams
perfect
pint
i
get
a
nice
bronze
color
with
a
foamy
multibubble
head
on
the
taste
this
brew
has
caramel
up
front
followed
by
a
zesty
but
not
very
bitter
hoppiness
almost
that
vinegar
twinge
of
a
typical
uk
brew
mouthfeel
is
equally
as
zesty
but
not
overly
so
a
good
sessioner
nothing
spectacular
but
a
decent
brew
at
a
reasonable
abv
not
really
an
ipa
but
zesty
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
while
rjt
o
if
this
were
classified
as
a
mild
ale
i
would
rate
it
higher
unfortunately
newcastle
called
it
an
ipa
which
it
isnt
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
as
labeled
taste
is
caramel
and
toffee
with
the
hops
coming
it
more
near
the
middle
and
finish
of
the
tasting
solid
and
quite
enjoyable
if
not
memorable
o
just
an
okay
brew
i
think
they
should
do
a
reset
and
figure
out
how
to
mix
a
winter
warmer
with
an
ipa
because
this
misses
the
mark
this
beer
kinda
of
reminds
me
of
a
winter
warmer
crossed
with
a
oktoberfest
or
amber
giving
this
beer
a
decent
taste
but
it
just
seems
to
miss
the
mark
a
bit
its
nothing
crazy
but
it
has
a
good
solid
profile
an
ipa
with
more
malt
to
it
which
is
nice
and
different
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
fractional
hoppiness
actually
reveals
itself
a
somewhat
accurate
version
of
a
mild
english
ipa
i
guess
i
get
a
unique
spice
presence
to
it
not
unlike
rye
toffee
is
a
main
malt
descriptor
miniscule
leathery
aspect
bitterness
is
down
in
the
mouthfeel
a
decent
option
to
have
in
the
fridgecooler
when
you
dont
want
bmc
type
guests
drinking
your
good
stuff
but
you
want
to
help
bridge
the
gap
for
them
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
what
i
was
expecting
in
an
ipa
but
my
bias
comes
from
drinking
american
ipas
would
drink
again
the
body
was
a
nice
even
medium
drinkability
was
very
good
i
could
have
easily
had
a
few
of
these
overall
a
nice
brew
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
not
sure
if
its
a
year
round
beer
good
overall
o
speaking
of
the
aforementioned
plum
pudding
i
bet
it
would
be
a
perfect
match
with
that
as
a
gift
i
certainly
wasnt
going
to
turn
these
freebies
down
and
theyre
pretty
tasty
to
boot
not
a
lot
to
choose
from
at
the
buffalo
wild
wings
in
dedham
ma
so
i
gave
this
a
try
hoping
to
see
some
semblance
of
my
former
admiration
for
the
road
weary
brown
ale
the
color
is
light
yellow
brown
with
a
nice
white
cover
but
very
little
lacing
the
aroma
brings
a
skunky
caramel
pond
water
idea
not
very
inviting
im
afraid
the
flavor
is
simple
caramel
water
with
some
weak
herballemon
hops
its
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
chalky
feel
and
mildy
carbonated
not
too
great
winter
i
dont
see
it
and
wont
revisit
unless
this
was
a
dirty
tap
line
or
something
taste
is
juicy
pine
yeasty
and
hoppy
character
but
gentle
with
jammy
and
fruitcandy
fruitiness
zestiness
it
has
definite
yeasty
and
hoppy
elements
but
tends
to
be
a
little
more
on
the
malty
and
fruity
sweet
side
so
that
it
is
really
arguably
more
like
an
esb
keeping
in
mind
that
real
english
ips
not
the
ipas
that
are
actually
bitters
have
lower
more
balanced
bitterness
than
most
americanstyle
ipas
but
predominantly
hoppy
and
yeasty
character
however
it
is
an
enjoyable
solid
beer
12oz
brown
bottle
pours
copper
with
a
thin
creamy
just
offwhite
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
on
the
glass
and
quickly
dissipates
to
a
thin
dusting
of
foam
atop
the
ale
aromas
are
caramel
malts
brown
bread
with
some
herbal
hops
tastes
malty
upfront
with
caramel
toasted
grain
a
touch
of
orange
with
a
slightly
peppery
mild
herbal
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
with
ample
carbonation
overall
i
was
hoping
for
more
here
its
sessionable
but
i
think
id
pass
for
something
else
rather
quickly
for
an
english
ipa
its
pretty
average
at
most
pours
an
ominously
dark
color
for
an
ipa
almost
brown
maybe
burnt
orange
with
an
offwhite
head
candylike
sweetness
on
the
nose
lots
of
sugar
and
toffee
no
real
hop
presence
at
all
maybe
a
light
spiciness
the
flavor
is
of
water
and
toffee
maybe
a
bit
of
caramel
again
almost
no
hop
presence
to
be
found
not
even
any
bitterness
not
good
at
all
very
disappointing
beer
especially
poignant
as
i
had
low
expectations
going
in
it
did
not
disappoint
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
slight
head
scent
has
some
bitterness
to
it
but
it
smells
more
like
an
adjunct
lager
wow
this
one
you
have
to
try
and
not
in
a
good
way
the
texture
is
light
and
dry
but
finishes
with
a
harsh
bitter
after
taste
overall
the
taste
is
barely
better
than
a
cheaply
made
malt
liquor
its
not
going
to
be
easy
finishing
this
off
definitely
avoid
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
tall
pint
glass
it
is
a
light
redish
amber
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
has
a
spicy
aroma
not
of
a
normal
ipa
but
may
be
due
to
the
hops
that
were
used
taste
is
a
tad
watery
but
has
plenty
of
hops
and
spice
to
it
carbonation
seems
right
and
balance
of
hops
and
malt
is
right
overall
a
slightly
above
average
ipa
the
newcastle
winter
ipa
was
actually
surprisingly
decent
i
didnt
have
high
expectations
going
in
but
it
was
rather
enjoyable
poured
it
from
bottle
to
glass
it
had
an
amber
almost
orangeish
color
to
it
with
a
frothy
head
didnt
get
much
from
the
smell
malty
caramel
flavor
light
hop
bitterness
warm
wintery
flavors
sortve
what
youd
expect
from
an
american
ipa
probably
isnt
the
best
out
there
doesnt
match
up
to
celebration
for
example
but
nevertheless
its
not
a
bad
choice
if
its
the
only
option
available
and
youre
feeling
festive
finally
getting
around
to
trying
this
one
it
pours
a
clear
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
shortlived
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
rich
toffee
toasted
caramel
light
biscuit
sharp
mint
sharp
grapefruit
peel
and
a
touch
of
cocoa
the
taste
holds
notes
of
lemon
zest
orange
peel
grass
toasted
biscuits
light
cilantro
light
lime
zest
and
caramel
things
combine
poorly
on
the
tongue
lemme
tell
you
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
dry
finish
overall
i
cant
in
good
conscience
call
this
an
ipa
winter
english
english
winter
or
otherwise
nor
can
i
call
it
a
good
beer
not
sure
what
happened
here
this
just
isnt
a
very
good
beer
the
flavors
dont
are
all
over
the
place
and
dont
mesh
well
the
finish
is
also
too
dry
not
a
good
job
by
newcastle
o
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
tried
but
kind
of
forgettable
overall
its
clear
to
me
this
beer
was
meant
more
to
introduce
people
who
dont
normally
drink
craft
to
start
drinking
craft
albeit
not
very
good
craft
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
a
bit
thin
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
session
beer
but
it
really
does
not
stand
out
that
much
ill
be
avoiding
this
one
in
the
future
the
medicinal
off
flavors
were
too
overpowering
overall
this
was
a
major
disappointment
i
thought
this
would
be
an
easy
drinking
english
ipa
instead
it
was
an
undrinkable
english
ipa
i
can
honestly
say
it
was
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
absolutely
horrible
maybe
something
happened
to
the
12
pack
i
bought
and
they
spoiled
or
something
i
dont
know
but
ive
got
to
find
some
poor
soul
to
take
the
rest
of
this
12
pack
a
decent
beer
it
started
out
very
good
with
the
sight
and
smell
but
the
rest
wasnt
as
good
i
would
try
this
again
though
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
with
a
nice
finebubbled
pale
tan
head
aroma
is
hoppy
a
little
malty
and
a
little
spicy
hoppy
spicy
flavor
makes
it
taste
somewhat
like
an
ipa
mixed
with
a
winter
warmer
distinctive
and
interesting
texture
is
firmbodied
edgy
and
fizzy
leaving
a
nice
if
not
persistent
tingle
look
for
it
o
moderately
tasty
but
underhopped
ipa
thats
more
of
a
cross
between
an
english
brown
and
an
english
pa
d
weird
lingering
taste
kind
of
throws
me
for
a
loop
i
cant
say
it
was
great
but
definitely
unique
not
sure
what
the
brewers
were
thinking
when
they
came
up
with
this
beer
but
it
seems
to
be
a
blend
of
ipas
you
have
been
warned
not
bad
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
not
something
id
pick
out
as
an
ipa
from
a
blind
test
but
it
is
still
tasty
very
drinkable
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
not
much
of
an
ipa
but
the
winter
spice
notes
and
nutty
charachter
come
thru
and
work
quite
well
solid
beer
despite
the
style
labeling
its
a
hair
peppery
its
refreshing
not
quite
as
sweet
as
the
brown
i
ordered
it
for
the
bar
and
am
pleasantly
surprised
how
many
people
from
both
sides
of
the
beer
spectrum
enjoy
it
final
thought
this
beer
isnt
bad
and
if
you
need
something
to
break
up
all
the
piss
colored
beers
you
normally
drink
this
is
a
refreshing
choice
only
7
a
six
the
abv
isnt
noted
glad
i
tried
it
makes
me
appreciate
thornbridge
that
much
more
o
not
all
that
bad
for
an
english
ipa
certainly
something
that
i
could
drink
a
few
bottles
of
appearance
is
what
to
be
expected
with
this
kinda
of
ale
the
smell
is
has
very
nice
sweet
notes
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
from
the
hops
the
taste
is
what
to
be
expected
for
this
type
of
beer
but
it
has
a
very
nice
balance
of
the
malts
to
hops
ratio
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
not
there
which
makes
a
really
great
beer
all
together
overall
this
isnt
a
great
beer
i
cant
say
its
horrible
there
just
isnt
much
to
it
bright
clear
aged
copper
color
not
much
of
a
head
or
lace
aromas
are
light
with
toffee
sweet
malt
and
herbal
notes
first
thing
you
taste
is
this
funky
woody
smoke
malt
then
some
herbal
notes
and
pepper
or
some
kind
of
peppery
spice
and
a
slight
after
taste
thats
not
unpleasant
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
light
to
medium
body
overall
not
bad
i
would
buy
again
poured
into
a
nonic
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
12
finger
white
head
that
held
pretty
well
for
awhile
subtle
is
a
good
word
to
be
used
for
the
aromascaramelbiscuit
maltironand
faint
leafy
hopseven
for
an
english
ipa
its
subtle
in
my
opinion
flavors
of
biscuit
maltsome
engrained
fruitinessand
again
light
leafy
hops
in
the
finish
i
understand
and
like
some
of
the
more
subtle
english
stuff
out
therethis
just
was
kinda
boring
in
my
opinion
i
usually
go
for
the
very
hoppy
ipas
and
i
had
a
feeling
newcastle
would
be
much
different
and
it
is
i
am
far
from
disapointed
not
much
of
a
fan
of
their
other
brews
but
definetely
love
this
one
i
bought
this
because
newcastle
has
always
been
reliably
good
for
me
for
a
long
time
they
earned
my
enthusiastic
purchase
and
ill
continue
to
try
their
limited
editions
im
just
saying
this
one
isnt
something
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
ive
really
enjoyed
the
recent
seasonal
offerings
from
newcastle
hope
they
keep
them
coming
o
middle
of
the
road
english
beer
no
more
no
less
6
996er
is
worth
it
to
me
o
as
ive
heard
others
say
newcastle
is
the
gateway
beer
but
this
winter
ipa
attempt
certainly
doesnt
promote
brand
loyalty
or
move
newcastle
past
that
reputation
the
mouthfeel
isnt
terribly
thin
though
it
is
a
little
otherwise
theres
a
good
carbonation
its
assertively
crisp
and
it
goes
pretty
smooth
into
the
finish
o
nothing
really
outstanding
but
nothing
bad
either
seems
like
it
would
be
a
good
session
beer
overall
not
great
but
not
bad
either
its
certainly
a
passable
brew
whereas
the
summer
and
werewolf
were
for
me
atrocious
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
an
easy
drinking
smooth
beer
that
doesnt
really
fill
you
up
id
recommend
this
to
starter
ipa
beer
drinkers
that
have
not
yet
ventured
into
the
extreme
or
higher
hoppy
beers
note
if
it
warms
up
at
all
the
flavor
becomes
undrinkable
overall
tasty
and
mild
not
a
strong
ale
this
would
be
a
good
gateway
beer
for
your
budweiser
swilling
friends
very
well
balanced
and
pushing
the
palate
a
bit
to
make
it
interesting
enough
to
want
more
than
one
bottle
comes
off
to
be
a
good
beer
from
a
less
talked
about
style
at
least
in
the
us
tasty
nice
unfiltered
ipa
with
plenty
of
hops
and
none
of
that
bitter
finish
good
hotdaydrinking
beer
one
of
the
best
ipas
around
if
just
looking
to
pick
up
something
that
is
not
hard
to
find
but
really
tasty
with
a
flair
of
citrus
and
very
drinkable
at
under
7
solid
ipa
at
a
really
good
price
o
i
would
consider
this
on
the
milder
side
of
an
ipa
not
too
strong
in
hops
and
very
minimal
on
the
malt
the
look
is
not
that
appealing
to
me
but
i
gave
it
leeway
since
it
is
unfiltered
i
would
drink
this
again
in
spring
and
summer
specifically
for
the
orangeycitrusy
flavor
drinkable
smooth
but
with
a
sharp
hoppy
kick
great
color
and
head
coming
it
at
6
abv
and
about
40
ibus
this
is
a
good
ipa
for
those
who
may
say
they
dont
like
ipas
overall
its
not
too
great
but
not
too
bad
its
easily
session
able
but
lacks
some
ipa
flavors
i
look
for
its
a
little
empty
in
flavor
and
the
smell
is
really
nothing
to
get
excited
about
maybe
more
of
an
apa
than
an
ipa
good
for
people
trying
to
get
into
an
ipa
or
those
that
dont
like
resiny
hop
flavors
very
tame
easy
drinking
ipa
a
good
place
to
start
for
those
new
to
hoppier
styles
not
too
hoppy
for
a
hopphobic
this
relatively
weak
for
my
latest
taste
standards
beer
was
a
wonderful
treat
to
alternate
with
long
trails
much
harsher
double
bag
it
offered
a
nice
aroma
and
full
flavor
and
was
even
bearable
unchilled
wish
it
was
stronger
but
i
reccomend
it
just
the
same
pours
hazy
orange
with
small
white
head
smells
citrusy
and
piney
tastes
of
citrusy
hops
with
a
malt
finish
and
creamy
feel
average
ipa
poured
from
bottle
into
snifter
pours
an
orange
color
with
minimal
head
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
bread
and
hints
of
apple
the
taste
is
of
citrus
most
notably
grapefruit
at
first
and
then
finishes
off
with
a
slight
malt
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
okay
with
just
a
little
too
much
carbonation
but
the
consistency
is
alright
overall
nothing
id
get
again

lacks
depth
not
very
wellbalanced
looks
like
theres
a
lot
of
sediment
floating
around
pale
golden
color
smells
slightly
hoppy
tastes
less
average
than
most
ipas
bitter
tasting
no
real
hints
of
anything
else
besides
some
hops
not
very
pleasant
on
the
tongue
thin
and
carbonated
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
one
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
it
went
bad
not
a
lot
of
flavor
here
at
least
for
my
taste
and
the
aroma
wasnt
anything
special
at
an
abv
of
6
ill
pass
overall
meh
nothing
too
special
hops
are
just
ok
malts
are
a
bit
too
much
although
fairly
balanced
and
drinkable
a
decent
ipa
aroma
and
look
lacks
the
excitement
that
most
really
good
ipas
deliver
taste
is
ok
but
leaves
me
wanting
a
little
more
hops
and
citrus
ok
brew
sort
of
shocked
i
havent
reviewed
this
one
before
but
real
cool
they
are
doing
it
in
cans
now
a
twelver
of
these
is
a
nice
buy
anytime
and
maybe
the
beer
is
even
better
in
this
format
they
call
it
an
english
style
but
its
definitely
not
over
balanced
by
grain
and
it
definitely
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
english
yeast
character
to
it
for
me
its
a
nice
fluffy
bodied
juicy
hopped
ipa
with
tons
of
hops
but
only
minimal
bitterness
the
kind
of
hoppy
beer
you
want
to
drink
on
a
hoppy
beer
hangover
that
sounds
bad
but
its
true
so
cold
and
refreshing
right
from
the
can
a
beer
that
is
appealing
anytime
and
i
think
the
world
needs
more
of
those
the
hops
are
west
coasty
in
nature
not
overly
oily
but
prominently
pine
forward
with
a
fresh
squeezed
character
to
them
clean
in
the
finish
though
maybe
the
most
refreshing
english
style
ipa
on
the
planet
good
for
long
trail
for
making
this
one
in
a
twelve
pack
of
cans
it
could
be
the
best
beer
in
that
medium
going
right
now
if
i
lived
back
home
i
would
be
crushing
these
this
winter
overall
while
i
wasnt
crazy
about
the
taste
the
other
positive
elements
of
this
ipa
give
it
a
better
than
average
rating
in
my
book
lightamber
pour
cloudy
and
slippery
mouthfeel
like
all
long
trails
decent
head
at
first
then
persistent
but
thin
white
lacing
wellcarbonated
straight
up
hop
profile
cascade
i
think
lingering
bitter
finish
could
be
less
sweet
even
hoppier
but
still
very
enjoyable
as
usual
long
trail
disappoints
good
bitterness
but
lacks
any
real
flavor
enjoy
this
beer
does
not
need
any
improvement
once
again
somebody
filled
a
craft
can
to
the
brim
giving
me
a
little
spritz
on
the
crack
i
went
with
an
inverted
glug
especially
since
it
is
unfiltered
and
may
need
some
rousing
this
is
precisely
what
theoldlady
hates
but
it
did
not
say
to
pour
gently
it
settled
into
twoplus
fingers
of
dense
eggshellwhite
head
with
great
retention
what
a
difference
from
the
earlier
saisons
color
was
a
cloudy
yellowgold
srm
4
5
nose
smelled
like
the
pine
trees
along
the
long
trail
this
really
acted
more
like
a
bridge
beetween
an
eipa
and
an
aipa
but
if
you
think
that
i
am
canplaining
your
are
mistaken
mouthfeel
was
medium
as
it
turns
out
those
were
mostly
aroma
hops
so
that
the
taste
while
on
the
upper
end
of
bitterness
for
an
eipa
was
still
more
malty
than
hoppy
this
made
a
nice
segue
from
the
saisons
and
other
belgianstyle
beers
earlier
today
into
the
hopped
up
beers
that
are
ondeck
finish
was
semidry
with
the
hops
ultimately
winning
out
over
the
malts
but
not
by
much
at
48
ibus
this
was
not
going
to
wreck
anybodys
palate
a
very
well
balanced
brew
the
hops
in
this
ipa
are
not
overwhelming
and
add
a
very
nice
refreshing
clean
taste
the
color
is
a
lighter
and
the
aroma
is
not
bold
but
it
is
distinctive
the
lacing
left
on
the
glass
was
beautiful
a
good
beer
that
is
well
worth
your
time
true
to
its
claims
it
is
unfiltered
cloudy
and
orangey
with
a
soapy
white
head
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
mild
with
light
citrus
and
bread
notes
the
taste
is
equally
mild
with
an
additional
earthy
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
fair
bit
of
carbonation
on
the
palate
and
it
is
a
little
thinner
a
good
not
great
ipa
overall
either
the
recipe
has
changed
or
there
are
a
lot
of
old
bottles
out
there
but
this
beer
is
surprisingly
good
when
fresh
i
wouldnt
spin
it
as
an
english
ipa
given
the
flavor
of
the
hops
in
my
sample
but
it
definitely
leans
toward
the
east
coast
with
the
balance
factor
o
decent
ipa
better
than
i
remember
i
could
easily
down
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
overall
a
very
good
beer
overall
solid
ipa
from
the
always
reliable
long
trail
i
paired
this
with
some
bbq
tofu
baked
beans
and
potato
salad
and
it
worked
perfectly
is
there
such
a
thing
as
a
picnic
ipa
if
so
this
is
it
my
first
time
trying
an
unfiltered
english
ipa
so
will
have
to
try
others
to
compare
as
i
liked
the
fruit
and
citrus
notes
but
not
enough
hop
bitterness
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
again
and
will
stick
with
their
limbo
ipa
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
golden
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
off
white
head
that
persists
forever
smells
of
bread
citrus
and
light
caramel
with
a
hint
of
fruity
esters
flavor
is
quite
malty
for
an
ipa
with
huge
bread
and
caramel
notes
offset
with
just
enough
earthy
hops
to
keep
it
from
being
too
sweet
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
somewhat
chalky
mouthfeel
middle
of
the
road
old
school
english
inspired
pale
ale
location
pa
this
is
a
great
beer
its
super
clean
and
well
balanced
and
with
the
right
glass
has
some
terrific
citrusy
aromas
i
can
drink
several
and
not
be
hammered
so
i
think
it
falls
under
the
session
category
and
beats
out
all
of
its
competition
especially
for
its
price
served
very
cold
in
a
pint
glass
was
a
cold
room
and
hard
to
evoke
a
scent
from
the
brew
however
was
poignant
and
a
nice
bit
of
bitter
color
was
deep
golden
and
transparent
was
the
third
of
a
set
of
beers
at
the
keg
room
in
nyc
and
was
the
most
enjoyable
of
the
bunch
will
try
again
when
the
weather
warms
up
a
bit
more
i
poured
this
beer
from
the
bottle
into
a
traditional
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
like
most
unfiltered
ipas
with
a
dark
copper
like
color
with
little
head
the
beer
has
a
nice
citrus
smell
that
is
mild
the
hops
are
aggressively
forward
as
expected
strikingly
similar
to
the
ipa
of
yards
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
i
tend
to
like
the
english
ipas
more
than
the
standard
american
ones
ive
drank
so
i
might
be
overly
generous
just
got
back
from
a
ski
trip
to
stowe
vermont
and
picked
up
a
six
pack
for
the
longdrive
home
good
not
too
hoppy
taste
and
nice
amber
color
not
much
smell
but
the
taste
and
look
made
up
for
it
a
very
enjoyable
beer
need
to
go
back
to
stowe
for
an
excuse
to
buy
more
not
the
most
typical
of
ipas
but
still
holds
up
and
it
doesnt
hurt
that
its
a
little
cheaper
than
lots
of
craft
brews
this
is
my
third
offering
from
long
trail
had
this
out
of
the
bottle
very
standard
ipa
if
anything
a
little
weak
on
the
hops
i
typically
dont
factor
price
into
ratings
but
long
trail
at
the
very
least
is
a
pretty
decent
value
give
it
a
try
but
probably
wont
knock
your
socks
off
pours
a
straw
colored
body
with
opaqueness
similar
to
a
hefeweizen
decent
head
nice
lacing
scents
of
faint
grapefruit
and
a
bit
of
pine
but
harder
to
detect
than
most
ipas
very
smooth
and
full
malts
complimented
by
a
bit
of
hoppy
bitterness
a
little
bit
of
an
english
ipa
not
overly
hoppy
which
is
good
once
in
a
while
you
can
actually
taste
something
other
than
hops
very
smooth
clean
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
chewiness
another
not
spectacular
but
good
beer
from
long
trail
bought
at
the
store
in
winooski
this
is
probably
the
first
unfiltered
ipa
ive
had
the
sediment
seemed
slightly
offputting
but
i
got
over
it
when
i
took
a
sip
its
got
a
bit
of
citrus
flavor
with
an
earthy
base
the
finish
is
a
tad
dry
id
probably
have
another
excellent
beer
best
served
slightly
chilled
not
real
cold
strong
hoppy
taste
but
it
doesnt
overwhelm
the
the
other
flavors
great
change
of
pace
beer
when
youve
hit
the
beer
blahs
aftertaste
doesnt
linger
as
the
second
beer
tastes
as
good
as
the
first
i
sampled
this
beer
after
drinking
half
of
an
oktoberfest
and
on
first
taste
i
knew
i
needed
to
drink
it
on
an
empty
palate
i
bought
a
single
bottle
of
it
today
and
i
will
be
putting
this
ipa
on
my
yes
list
when
you
first
get
a
whiff
of
its
aroma
you
get
a
strong
scent
of
pine
and
a
lesser
scent
of
fruit
i
was
quite
leery
of
it
upon
smell
but
quickly
changed
my
mind
after
taking
the
first
sip
it
is
not
overpowering
in
the
hoppy
sense
but
is
nicely
juxtaposed
with
an
eversolight
touch
of
citrus
this
will
become
a
favorite
of
mine
and
will
entice
those
generally
opposed
to
ipas
to
think
differently
and
perhaps
become
a
fan
its
a
decent
ipa
that
maybe
would
be
good
on
cooler
evenings
overall
i
would
recommend
longtrail
ipa
to
anyone
that
likes
ipas
and
are
on
a
budget
i
would
say
it
is
a
really
good
ipa
especially
for
beginners
in
craft
beer
i
really
did
enjoy
this
beer
and
i
would
order
it
at
a
bar
especially
if
it
were
fresh
cheers
does
nothing
for
me
somethings
not
right
with
the
balance
decent
enough
ipa
perhaps
close
to
a
session
ipa
but
there
is
too
much
competition
at
this
price
point
and
this
quality
especially
in
this
area
northeast
on
par
with
basic
harpoon
ipa
and
i
actually
prefer
harpoon
your
mileage
may
vary
edit
im
reading
other
reviews
which
seem
favorable
so
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
but
i
wouldnt
try
it
again
based
on
my
experience
a
clear
golden
orange
in
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
aromas
of
fresh
honey
and
citrus
rind
taste
is
a
perfumy
sweet
flower
flavor
up
front
then
some
water
cracker
then
a
lemony
minty
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
a
nice
ipa
that
i
would
get
again
flavor
is
a
well
balanced
malt
hop
mix
with
a
faint
buttery
aftertaste
nothing
too
exciting
going
on
but
enjoyable
mild
lingering
bitterness
overall
a
pretty
decent
offering
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
order
again
would
prefer
more
hop
flavor
pured
into
tulip
glass
nice
hazy
yellowamber
color
two
inch
white
foam
head
reduced
to
lacing
sticky
on
glass
fruity
pine
hops
little
bite
to
the
carbonation
really
good
ipa
i
would
get
this
one
again
makes
me
want
to
eat
seafood
give
this
one
a
try
i
bought
this
at
a
small
package
store
that
keeps
all
its
beer
refrigerated
the
distinctive
taste
of
this
beer
is
its
pine
flavor
one
of
the
few
on
the
market
that
has
not
moved
toward
a
pronounced
citrus
flavor
the
beer
is
malty
but
the
high
ibus
and
the
pineniness
give
it
a
distinctive
dry
character
that
is
great
with
stilton
cheese
ive
also
had
this
on
draft
and
would
rate
it
equally
highly
o
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
english
india
pale
ale
looks
really
nice
has
a
nose
that
improves
as
it
warms
and
has
a
really
smooth
mouthfeel
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
carbonation
cost
it
a
12
point
in
this
review
a
better
bubble
balance
and
this
would
be
more
drinkable
sessionable
even
i
found
this
to
be
enjoyable
and
balanced
a
good
example
of
an
ipa
from
the
east
coast
but
not
great
pretty
drinkable
and
less
likely
to
offend
those
who
arent
die
hard
hop
fans
o
not
a
bad
ipa
and
with
low
abv
is
a
nice
refreshing
summer
drink
overall
a
decent
sipper
for
something
like
a
summer
bbq
overall
this
is
a
nice
more
session
like
ipa
with
very
smooth
characteristics
overall
pretty
good
consumed
6202012
oa
decent
ipa
but
lacks
the
flavor
and
balance
to
put
it
in
the
upper
echelon
of
the
style
to
sum
it
up
i
now
consider
this
a
lawnmowing
ipa
and
not
a
porch
sipping
beauty
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
pale
clear
goldenrod
coloring
with
only
a
hint
of
sparse
film
on
top
aromas
of
cut
grass
a
subtle
bitterness
and
a
light
citrus
blend
the
nose
is
mild
overall
flavors
are
a
bit
on
the
roasted
side
initially
but
then
the
cedar
themed
hops
come
through
with
some
pepper
and
oregano
spicing
on
the
lateral
tongue
resiny
and
bitter
there
is
a
hint
of
citrus
blending
that
highlights
throughout
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
the
bitter
resiny
oily
hops
with
a
very
green
feel
overall
surprisingly
quick
finish
with
a
sharp
charring
and
slightly
drying
feel
bitter
linger
in
the
back
of
the
throat
decent
brew
and
light
on
the
abv
compared
to
most
ipas
so
this
one
wont
get
you
in
trouble
as
fast
not
bad
but
really
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
have
drank
many
an
ipa
and
i
have
to
say
if
youre
planning
on
having
more
than
six
ipas
this
is
the
beer
to
choose
i
drank
like
7
without
noticing
so
good
the
lacing
is
perfectamundo
and
the
head
and
body
are
perfectly
to
my
liking
seriously
get
some
of
this
stuff
my
favorite
beer
is
stone
ruination
ipa
and
this
beer
semireminds
me
of
it
as
well
as
camping
out
in
the
green
mnts
goodtimes
goodbeer
overall
even
for
english
ipa
nothing
too
impressive
but
still
a
beer
thats
enjoyable
i
could
have
this
again
nice
hazy
golden
orange
color
decent
head
of
thickish
suds
only
piles
up
to
about
12
inch
even
after
an
aggressive
pour
nose
is
dull
faint
smell
of
hops
and
fruit
taste
is
not
overly
hopped
but
very
bitter
aftertaste
lingers
for
a
long
trail
time
as
the
beer
warms
is
has
a
medicinal
cherry
like
flavor
reminiscent
of
shipyard
ipa
i
remember
liking
this
a
lot
more
in
the
past
it
was
always
a
great
bargain
at
ten
bucks
a
twelve
pack
obviously
batch
control
is
an
issue
and
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
purchase
this
again
with
so
many
better
local
ipas
to
choose
from
does
nothing
outstanding
but
it
doesnt
do
anything
wrong
either
overall
a
very
solid
ipa
could
be
considered
a
stronger
pale
ale
in
some
regards
as
the
bitterness
and
hop
presence
is
a
bit
light
overall
just
okay
nothing
special
here
a
nicely
balanced
ipa
not
overdone
on
the
hops
and
the
feel
really
makes
it
o
a
decent
balanced
ipa
thats
easy
drinking
and
no
hint
of
alcohol
nothing
special
it
is
easy
drinking
and
overall
not
bad
but
if
youre
looki
g
for
a
bold
ipa
this
isnt
it
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
amber
color
there
is
about
a
finger
of
white
head
resting
ontap
it
has
decent
head
retention
and
there
is
some
scattered
lace
left
behind
on
the
glass
the
nose
has
some
caramel
maltiness
and
a
nice
hop
presence
there
are
some
aromas
of
tropical
fruit
and
citrus
here
as
well
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
it
starts
off
with
some
caramel
malt
and
a
nice
citrusy
and
piney
hop
bite
there
are
some
tropical
fruit
flavors
that
come
through
as
well
the
finish
leaves
some
lingering
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
behind
on
the
palate
this
has
a
lighter
medium
body
and
average
carbonation
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
pretty
good
feel
to
it
there
is
some
sweetness
and
the
hop
bitterness
is
there
but
a
little
on
the
lower
side
this
has
good
drinkability
it
has
nice
flavor
and
goes
down
smooth
it
is
a
little
light
on
the
hoppy
side
of
things
but
it
is
a
pretty
nice
ipa
overall
i
think
it
is
worth
trying
out
id
drink
it
again
the
body
here
is
nice
and
light
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
a
solid
effort
well
balanced
and
really
enjoyable
o
not
a
bad
ipa
good
ill
come
back
to
it
not
a
bad
ipa
this
is
a
simple
brew
and
not
in
your
face
maybe
a
good
ipa
to
a
unsophisticated
palate
a
decent
summer
ipa
o
a
good
beer
i
wish
i
saw
more
unfiltered
ipas
not
the
most
fruit
hoppy
ipa
but
a
very
well
balanced
easy
drinking
brew
here
this
is
a
very
good
sessionable
brew
a
nice
change
in
the
hop
profile
from
the
typical
ipas
brewed
in
the
states
a
case
worthy
ipa
and
at
this
price
point
i
could
easily
see
this
being
in
my
typical
case
rotation
o
not
a
bad
ipa
i
would
definitely
drink
this
often
not
too
much
to
make
me
not
want
another
and
not
dry
to
make
me
choose
something
else
a
good
refreshing
ipa
definatly
needs
more
carbonation
overall
man
long
trail
whats
with
all
the
numbers
if
you
just
made
it
072011
i
would
have
known
the
date
and
would
have
found
it
fresher
not
bad
old
though
super
clean
and
well
blended
flavors
very
nice
change
of
pace
from
those
super
fruity
american
ipas
overall
a
very
good
drinkable
beer
that
is
on
the
safe
side
of
ipa
land
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
anyone
who
is
new
to
craft
beer
12oz
bottle
with
a
bottled
on
date
of
091511
pours
a
cloudy
brownish
amber
color
with
very
little
head
good
amount
ofof
lacing
aroma
is
bready
with
some
pine
and
apricots
taste
is
a
bit
bready
with
some
nice
pine
and
floral
hops
slight
amount
of
apricot
maybe
but
more
floral
than
the
nose
decent
mouthfeel
bitter
at
the
end
oily
overall
it
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
to
have
in
a
mix
12
pack
and
i
would
look
for
this
on
its
own
or
on
tap
o
delicious
ipa
great
paring
of
hops
and
malts
and
great
balance
definitely
a
go
to
and
its
available
just
about
everywhere
o
another
really
solid
offering
from
long
trail
i
really
like
this
brewery
and
they
didi
a
nice
job
with
this
ipa
overall
this
is
a
very
good
ipa
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
that
enjoys
a
good
and
simple
ipa
this
is
my
favorite
ipa
pine
hoppy
smell
and
taste
right
out
of
the
gate
it
feels
a
little
watery
but
the
taste
and
the
super
clean
finish
really
help
this
as
hard
as
i
try
i
just
cant
make
a
head
appear
on
the
golden
colored
beer
there
is
no
real
carbonation
and
that
is
this
beers
downfall
all
that
said
its
one
of
my
favorites
i
just
expect
more
out
of
my
favorite
brewery
o
its
easy
to
have
4
or
5
of
these
in
rapid
succession
i
think
itd
go
well
with
a
steak
or
burger
enjoyable
beer
notes
some
more
carbonation
would
go
a
long
way
here
othe
nose
was
fine
but
it
was
down
hill
from
there
it
needed
some
flavor
in
the
taste
either
citrus
or
grassyearth
tones
both
were
present
but
not
enough
to
make
a
flavorful
beer
o
not
all
that
bad
but
the
ipa
is
a
little
stronger
then
i
like
o
real
nice
englisheast
coast
ipa
overall
i
think
i
would
greatly
prefer
to
spend
an
extra
53
cents
per
six
pack
to
get
the
mission
street
ipa
at
trader
joes
as
my
usual
dinnertime
beer
too
bad
they
are
30
minutes
away
i
cant
exactly
say
this
beer
was
a
great
ipa
it
would
actually
make
a
better
attempt
at
the
belgian
style
even
though
the
bitterness
is
high
i
still
cant
associate
this
beer
with
the
ipa
style
i
have
enjoyed
everything
from
long
trail
so
far
but
his
beer
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
i
think
they
either
tried
too
hard
or
got
their
batches
mixed
up
be
sure
to
try
it
and
see
what
you
think
having
this
on
draft
at
the
brewery
i
think
helped
me
appreciate
this
beer
a
bit
more
its
got
a
fresh
english
hop
bill
with
a
bit
of
an
edge
to
it
yet
still
stays
nice
and
approachable
this
would
be
a
good
starter
ipa
to
introduce
someone
to
im
going
to
be
giving
this
one
a
second
look
down
the
road
but
for
tonight
im
psyched
and
recommending
it
to
the
peeps
this
ipa
definitely
stands
up
to
a
lot
of
the
popular
ipas
up
there
and
it
has
a
nice
bitter
hop
bite
to
it
as
well
the
unfiltered
quality
to
this
beer
definitely
adds
to
the
flavor
and
i
think
if
it
was
filtered
would
be
a
bit
watery
and
not
as
much
as
hop
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
saved
by
it
being
unfiltered
cause
it
kinda
has
a
thin
body
to
it
this
is
one
of
the
best
sessionable
ipas
out
there
in
my
opinion
and
definitely
worth
7

i
enjoyed
a
few
of
these
while
in
burlington
for
the
weekend
but
not
sure
i
would
actively
seek
this
out
also
i
dont
quite
understand
the
classification
as
an
eipa
long
trail
ipa
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
minimal
lacing
and
a
quarterinch
head
a
soapy
film
lingers
there
is
a
faint
lemon
and
hoppy
scent
here
a
crisp
and
light
citrus
taste
with
no
hoppy
bite
but
the
presence
is
there
more
of
a
malty
than
hoppy
aftertaste
too
which
is
surprising
a
good
session
ipa
and
a
quality
long
trail
brew
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
nicely
balanced
and
smooth
if
not
just
a
bit
bland
the
aroma
was
quite
subtle
and
could
have
had
a
bit
more
punch
o
i
liked
this
brew
wellenough
but
there
are
many
other
ipas
id
rather
have
this
ipa
pours
out
as
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
decent
head
at
first
the
white
fizzy
head
becomes
a
thin
white
line
across
the
top
of
the
brew
the
smell
is
lightly
hoppy
you
can
tell
that
its
going
to
be
an
ipa
by
the
aroma
it
has
the
taste
has
a
decent
hop
kick
at
first
that
changes
into
some
malt
flavors
with
some
dryness
in
the
aftertaste
overall
long
trail
puts
out
decent
beers
theyre
worth
trying
so
you
can
get
the
picture
of
what
they
do
there
this
beer
is
t
bad
i
would
drink
it
again
pretty
standard
english
ipa
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
finger
of
wellretaining
head
piney
hops
in
the
aroma
with
some
citrus
notes
citrus
and
pine
in
the
taste
with
a
sugary
sweetness
coming
through
very
light
malts
finishes
a
bit
dry
with
some
bitterness
lightmedium
mouthfeel
and
average
drinkability
d
this
is
my
first
eipa
review
and
i
am
enjoying
this
style
thoroughly
its
nice
to
have
a
typically
very
mild
style
epas
beefed
up
good
shit
long
trail
o
one
of
long
trails
better
offerings
a
solid
beer
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
good
i
would
consider
this
to
be
one
of
the
better
session
beers
a
very
nice
example
of
an
english
ipa
definitely
worth
a
try
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
can
be
drank
all
night
very
refreshing
and
could
easily
be
drank
during
the
summer
better
than
those
summer
ales
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
it
has
good
flavor
and
is
very
refreshing
light
hazy
orange
with
dissipating
white
head
weak
aroma
of
grass
and
lemons
tastes
of
grass
mint
slight
citruslemon
hop
leaves
bitterness
and
then
dryness
that
makes
you
thirst
and
lemon
skins
to
finish
the
drink
light
in
body
with
light
carbonation
a
sessionable
ipa
with
great
dry
characteristics
o
a
good
beer
but
one
i
would
pass
up
given
a
moderate
choice
of
other
brews
pours
a
nice
very
creamy
one
and
half
finger
creamy
white
head
smells
very
floral
earthy
cedar
wood
tastes
lemony
earthy
floral
lavender
earthy
very
coating
mouthfeel
oily
medium
bodied
finishes
powdery
dry
medium
carbonation
i
could
drink
only
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
the
dryness
is
a
bit
much
for
me
1
50
a
single
at
whole
foods
d
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
also
quite
sessionable
d
i
was
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
crisp
and
fresh
hops
flavors
dont
exactly
punch
you
in
the
mouth
but
settle
effortlessly
for
an
enjoyable
ride
down
the
ipa
trail
its
nothing
worldbeating
but
a
very
solid
ipa
it
turned
out
to
be
a
bit
stronger
in
the
alcohol
department
than
i
envisioned
but
i
could
have
easily
ha
another
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
the
wheat
gives
it
a
good
touch
and
i
could
easily
see
myself
having
more
of
this
when
the
weather
warms
up
a
bit
more
this
is
a
good
east
coast
ipa
and
a
nice
change
from
the
others
ive
had
that
blend
into
each
other
after
a
while
worth
a
try
for
hopheads
o
a
drinkable
almost
sessionable
eipa
a
great
represntation
of
the
style
tasty
and
a
breath
of
fresh
air
from
the
biggeryounger
brother
american
ipas
overall
a
pretty
average
ipa
i
like
the
brewery
and
other
brews
they
make
this
was
just
disappointing
compared
to
those
very
eary
drinking
if
others
arent
available
a
more
subdued
take
on
the
ipa
that
keeps
the
hops
from
monopolizing
the
taste
which
i
actually
enjoyed
a
nice
beer
from
long
trail
d
i
was
torn
on
this
one
on
one
hand
it
is
unique
with
its
blend
of
floral
hops
and
spicy
notes
while
being
easy
drink
all
the
while
on
the
other
hand
its
not
quite
what
i
look
for
in
an
ipa
it
was
left
wanting
more
because
i
was
in
the
mood
for
an
ipa
that
being
said
it
is
a
good
tasting
beer
just
not
a
typical
ipa
on
the
ipa
scale
i
give
it
a
c
the
overall
beer
taste
is
a
solid
b
together
that
makes
it
a
b
in
my
book
an
ipa
for
non
ipa
fans
from
notes
tasted
sept
2010
dm
slight
carbonation
tingle
smooth
on
the
pallet
lingering
citrus
notes
nice
drinking
brew
the
nose
detects
some
faint
whiff
of
tangerine
or
something
citrical
the
palate
perceives
aubtle
malt
that
finishes
in
a
sweet
fade
followed
by
a
wet
bread
washout
it
does
have
a
fine
balance
and
could
go
down
as
a
very
easy
sessional
quaff
not
much
else
going
on
here
next
the
clearest
unfiltered
beer
i
have
ever
enjoyed
however
with
uniformly
large
suspended
solids
wonderful
hop
nose
but
overly
sweet
taste
which
doesnt
complement
the
bitter
finish
not
a
well
balanced
beer
but
shows
promise
and
certainly
a
pint
id
give
another
chance
the
beer
did
seem
that
it
was
slightly
off
i
must
have
another
and
come
back
to
my
review
the
only
caveat
was
the
mouthfeel
part
that
was
flattened
a
bit
compared
to
other
ipas
but
i
think
if
you
considered
that
this
is
an
unfiltered
ipa
resembling
a
wheat
then
you
will
find
this
an
excellent
beer
im
really
not
too
impressed
with
this
offering
though
i
think
that
its
probably
the
yeast
that
i
dumped
in
my
pint
glass
so
ill
have
to
try
it
again
to
make
sure
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
pour
is
a
moderate
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
nose
is
really
plain
with
a
bit
of
bready
malt
as
well
as
some
very
faint
citrus
hops
the
taste
brings
some
very
very
mild
grapefruit
flavor
and
a
bit
of
grain
feel
has
a
decent
body
but
no
indication
that
this
is
an
eipa
a
decent
beer
but
not
up
to
par
with
better
versions
of
the
style
pours
goldenorange
with
a
small
short
lived
white
head
and
lovely
carbonation
yeast
settles
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
aroma
is
of
citrus
hops
balanced
by
biscuit
malt
citrusy
hops
and
grapefruit
dominate
the
flavor
with
biscuit
malt
provide
good
balance
long
hoppy
dry
finish
nicely
made
ipa
drinkability
a
nice
ipa
not
as
in
your
face
as
siera
nevada
more
along
the
lines
of
harpoon
with
a
different
hops
flavor
very
easy
to
drink
love
it
because
this
is
a
mild
ipa
that
doesnt
taste
terrible
i
would
say
the
drinkability
is
fairly
high
nothing
crazy
awesome
about
it
but
nothing
crazy
bad
either
d
very
simple
enjoyable
ipa
would
definitely
recommend
it
pretty
drinkable
but
there
are
much
better
ipa
choices
for
the
price
some
ipas
benefit
from
being
unfiltered
but
i
think
this
would
actually
improve
if
it
was
filtered
also
maybe
some
more
late
hop
additions
for
more
of
a
hop
flavor
would
be
nice
i
wont
buy
this
again
all
right
folks
let
me
get
right
down
to
the
nitty
gritty
of
this
terrible
beer
its
smells
bad
but
it
gets
worse
from
there
it
taste
like
they
brewed
right
out
of
some
india
pond
water
mixed
with
200
proof
rubbing
alcohol
it
burns
in
your
mouth
its
that
bad
folks
d
very
refreshing
beer
and
would
be
great
to
session
i
will
certainly
grab
some
my
next
trip
to
the
northeast
d
although
a
good
example
of
the
style
probably
not
the
most
exciting
beer
i
could
probably
have
a
couple
but
after
that
would
want
to
move
on
to
something
else
d
a
nice
english
ipa
although
nothing
is
overpower
they
flavors
blend
well
which
makes
this
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
average
there
is
average
carbonation
and
a
light
body
that
leaves
your
mouth
feeling
wet
as
opposed
to
a
dry
finish
overall
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
much
to
this
beer
especially
compared
to
long
trails
dipa
which
is
a
real
winner
in
my
opinion
ive
had
much
better
examples
of
the
style
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
i
dont
mind
this
beer
because
it
doesnt
pretend
to
be
a
flavor
bomb
its
light
and
fairly
enjoyable
real
easy
drinking
when
its
hot
out
dthis
is
ok
but
there
are
too
many
other
great
ipas
out
there
why
bother
d
ill
have
another
please
good
stuff
especially
at
12
99
a
12pack
a
very
enjoyable
ipa
id
have
a
few
of
these
in
the
sun
relaxing
but
with
food
id
want
something
with
a
bit
more
bite
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
marked
011309797911
sampled
on
july
29
2010
the
pour
was
a
strawyellow
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
carbonated
head
the
aroma
had
a
stronger
malt
note
than
hops
but
it
was
also
a
bit
skunky
the
look
and
smell
reminded
me
more
of
a
macro
pale
lager
the
taste
was
a
tick
better
with
a
more
malty
sensation
but
little
in
the
way
of
hops
long
trail
usually
satisfies
my
beer
thirst
but
based
on
the
other
reviews
i
have
read
i
had
to
have
had
a
bad
bottle
because
this
really
had
no
ipa
feel
to
it
at
all
i
hate
to
admit
it
but
it
tasted
more
like
colt
45
or
oe800
although
not
quite
as
biting
very
cloudy
for
an
ipa
pours
an
orangeyellow
color
with
a
decent
head
that
quickly
backs
down
but
doesnt
recede
completely
decent
lacing
as
well
not
as
much
head
as
most
ipas
but
still
acceptable
faint
smell
of
hops
and
slightly
fruity
though
no
smells
are
particularly
potent
so
far
so
good
unfortunately
the
taste
is
where
this
starts
to
fall
apart
again
weak
on
the
hops
although
oddly
still
bitter
despite
this
perhaps
there
is
not
enough
balancing
with
malts
going
on
but
its
hard
to
tell
it
does
feel
nice
swirling
around
though
overall
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
very
drinkable
for
me
as
the
beer
seems
to
be
only
bitter
with
not
much
else
going
on
what
impresses
me
about
many
ipas
is
the
ability
to
pound
you
over
the
head
with
hops
while
balancing
it
out
in
some
way
so
that
its
not
unpleasant
this
is
unpleasant
with
no
balancing
and
not
even
that
much
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
with
a
buttery
quality
drinks
bigger
than
5
9
alcohol
and
a
welcome
sessionable
ipa
making
the
beer
highly
drinkable
excellent
d
a
very
accessible
ipa
if
youre
looking
for
a
lot
of
hop
it
isnt
exactly
here
however
i
like
how
this
ipa
is
more
modest
in
presentation
there
are
more
tastes
and
aromas
that
arent
masked
by
hops
a
damn
good
beer
drinkability
a
pleasantly
sessionable
ipa
not
the
most
complex
and
not
overly
hoppy
but
tasty
and
enjoyable
drinkabilityi
like
this
ipa
but
its
got
some
minor
flaws
that
prevent
it
from
being
really
great
d
kinda
no
frills
as
ipas
go
nothings
too
overthetop
i
can
see
drinking
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
and
probably
will
with
the
4th
of
july
fireworks
tonight
not
something
that
im
going
to
seek
out
but
pretty
good
especially
with
a
very
moderate
price
tag
one
of
my
favorite
beers
inexpensive
enough
for
everyday
drinking
and
still
great
tasting
d
this
may
not
be
the
hoppiest
or
biggest
ipa
around
but
i
really
enjoy
its
moderate
bitterness
and
simple
bready
malt
profile
on
another
note
i
really
enjoy
the
charm
of
this
cloudy
beer
in
a
supermarket
full
of
crystal
clear
ipas
definitely
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
cheap
too
not
a
terrible
beer
by
any
stretch
quite
drinkable
but
this
is
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
part
of
their
mix
12
pack
that
a
friend
brought
to
my
house
poured
into
a
british
style
pint
glass
yelloworange
color
very
hazy
body
for
an
ipa
nice
head
and
lacing
got
a
nice
grapefruit
smell
on
the
nose
flavor
was
subtle
which
is
how
i
prefer
an
ipa
there
was
a
nice
dose
of
hops
but
it
was
not
overpowering
mouthfeel
was
not
bitter
which
is
what
i
wanted
but
i
found
the
beer
a
tad
on
the
thin
side
drinkability
to
me
was
a
bit
higher
than
other
ipas
because
it
was
not
a
hop
bomb
like
some
consumers
love
just
a
nice
ipa
with
a
decent
dose
of
hops
fine
by
me
md
the
somewhat
thin
body
is
compounded
by
undercarbonation
which
may
have
been
intentional
based
on
the
style
easy
to
drink
and
great
price
as
always
from
long
trail
if
i
had
a
friend
that
is
looking
to
get
into
ipas
id
probably
have
them
try
this
out
its
an
alright
ipa
but
too
light
of
an
ipa
pours
an
orangy
coper
color
with
moderate
head
leaving
ok
lacing
smell
is
of
earthy
and
floral
hops
with
a
carmel
and
biscuity
background
taste
brings
the
slightly
bitter
earthy
and
floral
hops
along
with
a
carmel
and
biscuity
malt
background
creamy
body
lacking
carbonation
decent
beer
nothing
spectacular
verry
solid
ipa
but
gets
pretty
boring
with
even
a
little
to
much
ale
so
buy
fresh
brilliant
golden
color
thin
and
lacy
head
that
doesnt
stay
thick
but
leaves
a
bit
on
the
glass
smells
strongly
of
hops
citrusy
and
herbal
lighter
malt
taste
strong
herbal
hop
taste
with
a
moderate
citrusfruit
flavor
lingering
herbal
hop
taste
smooth
feel
with
the
hop
flavor
balancing
out
the
carbonation
very
drinkable
in
the
style
of
long
trails
other
beers
but
with
more
flavor
and
more
body
which
is
the
best
way
to
enjoy
thsi
beer
this
is
no
superhopped
ipa
just
a
very
nicely
flavorful
ale
and
drinkable
good
sessionoutdoorbbq
beer
but
i
would
almost
not
put
it
in
teh
ipa
category
as
it
is
just
mildly
aromatic
and
hoppy
but
i
like
it
although
their
signature
alt
is
better
drinkability
this
maybe
works
as
a
session
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
think
ill
stock
my
fridge
with
something
a
bit
more
flavorful
cheers
poured
from

touch
of
spice
up

then
mellows
out
with
combination
of
hops

not
overly
hoppy
which
i
appreciate
crisp
smooth
feel
easy
drinking
had
not
seen
this
one
before
and
glad
i
grabbed
it
a
very
good
beer
unlike
the
nose
the
bitterness
represents
in
the
taste
right
off
the
bat
some
buttery
nutty
undertones
that
help
the
hops
take
flight
are
detectable
but
this
is
a
bittersour
english
hops
melange
as
you
would
expect
i
would
cut
the
carbonation
a
touch
but
overall
this
is
a
servicable
english
ipa
good
for
laid
back
drinking
and
enjoyment
during
the
fall
if
i
had
my
choice
id
vote
for
more
hops
and
less
citrus

goes
down

for

barbecues
with

company
dont
think
anyone
would
be
too
sorry
to
try
this
one

an

does
not

to
be

honey
color
with
a
small
tight
white
head
that
settled
into
a
light
cap
the
aroma
is
of
a
light
malt
with
a
lemon
or
tealike
hop
presence
hop
presence
not
very
strong
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
of
a
honey
malt
with
some
lemon
and
a
grassy
bitter
hop
it
has
a
bit
of
a
sugary
taste
as
well
definitely
malt
driven
but
i
figured
there
would
be
more
of
a
hop
presense
it
is
barely
noticable
moderate
body
with
fizzy
carbonation
nice
balance
the
drinkability
is
fine
actually
drinks
easy
but
the
hop
profile
seems
week
even
for
an
eipa
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
rather
mild
some
hops
taste
is
of
light
hops
with
some
citrus
a
hint
of
malts
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
fairly
enjoyable
beer
this
unfiltered
real
ipa
from
long
trail
strikes
a
nice
middle
ground
in
the
style
its
not
quite
as
hoppy
as
most
of
the
american
ones
out
there
but
certainly
hoppier
than
your
average
english
ipa
a
satisfying
grainy
finish
rounds
things
out
simply
one
of
those
solid
brews
you
could
go
all
night
with
long
trail
traditional
ipa
is
an
easy
sipper
and
a
solid
beer
id
have
trouble
with
with
many
of
these
due
to
the
excessive
gas
d
highly
drinkable
a
good
solid
ipa
that
one
can
enjoy
all
night
simply
too
drinkable
and
sessionable
the
best
lt
ive
had
the
ale
is
good
but
this
somehow
is
a
great
unknown
to
me
ill
now
never
forget
maybe
my
tastebuds
and
this
large
pilsner
glass
helped
who
knows
a
t
for
an
ipa
it
has
a
very
berry
taste
to
it
not
as
spicy
as
you
might
expect
from
an
ipa
its
a
very
interesting
taste
its
worth
a
try
because
its
good
just
not
what
im
looking
for
out
of
an
ipa
i
was
really
pleased
with
this
beer
i
believe
it
has
56
ibus
making
it
a
milder
ipa
but
its
enabled
me
to
ease
some
of
my
friends
into
drinking
somewhat
hoppier
beers
the
beer
its
self
goes
down
very
easy
with
a
clean
hoppy
finish
and
an
afater
taste
that
doesnt
linger
too
long

i
could

my

bought
this
for
7
bucks
english
ipas
are
terribly
underratedthey
are
very
flavorful
and

for
an

even
for
an

ipa
but
the
floral

are
balanced
nicely
by
the
earthiness
and
lightly
sweet

nothing
to
really
wow
you
here
but
nothing
wrong
either
a
solid
drinkable
beer
not
my
favorite
version
of
ipa
by
any
means
as
an
unfiltered
ipa
i
guess
it
passable
i
guess
i
was
just
shocked
with
the
first
one

they
got
somewhat

thanks
erik
d
very
easy
to
drink
a
good
ipa
to
ease
others
into
the
class
but
i
prefer
something
with
a
little
more
oomph
to
it
and
im
no
hophead
the
color
of
the
beer
is
copper
slightly
hazy
due
to
unfiltered
the
intensity
of
the
aroma
is
light
and
mainly
malty
with
some
hops
notes
taste
is
slightly
hoppy
with
some
bitterness
a
not
so
aggressive
ipa
for
a
change
i
would
say
this
is
a
good
introductory
ipa
a
very
refreshing
beer
nothing
out
of
this
world
but
still
good
to
drink
during
hot
summer
days
mouthfeel
is
a
thin
medium
i
would
like
a
little
more
creaminess
but
maybe
that
could
be
produced
with
a
handpump
drinkability
is
really
nice
this
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
for
somebody
not
to
into
hefes
recommended
d
yes
this
beer
is
drinkable
i
am
a
fan
of
the
english
style
ipas
but
dont
think
this
one
really
holds
true
to
the
style
this
beer
pours
a
clear
lighter
straw
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
lasts
a
few
minutes
leaving
very
minimal
spots
of
lace
nose
is
of
a
muted
pine
and
floral
hops
and
grainy
malt
taste
is
relatively
bland
and
muted
citrus
hops
start
this
beer
grain
and
caramel
malts
rest
in
the
middle
and
finishes
with
a
touch
of
piney
hops
although
decently
blended
the
tastes
are
extremely
muted
lighter
bodied
medium
carbonation
slight
afterbite
of
hops
this
is
an
average
ipa
that
i
wouldnt
turn
away
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
bottle
from
my
mom
a
deep
orangey

frothy

good
stuff
cheers
d
a
decent
ipa
i
would
definitely
have
another
a
well
balanced
ipa
that
can
be
enjoyed
anytime
this
beer
is
in
my
opinion
best
served
cold
when
not
quite
to
refrigerator
temperature
the
hop
taste
sticks
around
in
the
mouth
a
little
too
long
drinkable
as
an
ipa
could
be
but
its
really
just
a
really
good
pale
ale
d
not
a
bad
ipa
but
not
great
light
body
a
tad
thin
but
some
smoothness
w
resinous
flash
in
the
finish
carbonation
is
moderate
but
with
all
the
piney
resins
in
the
flavor
seems
overly
crisp
at
times
out
of
a
bomber
this
beer
was
a
hazy
goldentangerine
color
the
three
fingers
of
lightbeige
head
displayed
very
good
retention
eventually
turning
from
a
fluffy
cap
to
little
islands
and
lacing
in
consistent
sticky
bands
the
aroma
was
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
with
some
grapefruit
and
tangerine
atop
a
pale
malt
backbone
wellbalanced
the
flavors
were
a
little
less
welldefined
than
the
aroma
but
still
good
the
juicy
citrus
came
forward
first
followed
by
a
bland
malty
middle
a
touch
of
alcohol
some
herbal
notes
and
a
bitter
citrus
rind
finish
that
lingered
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
good
a
very
good
i
p
a
but
the
flavors
were
slightly
more
neutral
than
i
prefer
in
the
style
and
did
not
quite
live
up
to
all
the
other
elements
that
were
quite
impressive
i
remember
this
was
the
first
ipa
i
ever
had
back
in
college
i
thought
it
was
so
bitter
and
hardcore
but
now
that
i
come
back
to
it
it
seems
very
mellow
and
tame
and
so
very
awesome
d
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
englishstyle
ipa
certainly
worth
a
try
poured
into
a
mug
a
hazy
yellowgold
with
a
finger
of
sticky
white
head
head
doesnt
last
very
long
but
does
leave
noticeable
lacing
on
the
glass
no
real
discernible
scent
taste
is
of
hop
bitterness
with
maybe
some
citrusy
flavors
a
friend
brought
me
a
few
of
these
from
the
states
and
have
been
impressed
with
their
drinkability
the
mouth
is
thickish
and
slightly
oily
this
could
be
an
easy
beer
to
session
i
made
two
disappear
with
my
burger
this
beer
has
enough
flavors
to
stand
up
to
most
foods
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
not
what
i
expect
from
an

a

ipa
would
drink
over
most
other
ne
ipas
poured
into
the
center
of
a
traditional
pint
glass
there
was
some
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
which
i
mistakenly
poured
into
the
glass
which
made
the
beer
mostly
opaque
it
has
a
straw
color
and
a
thick
white
head
that
leaves
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
it
recedes
to
a
skim
of
bubbles
on
the
top
of
the
beer
there
is
a
mild
hoppy
aroma
the
taste
has
a
medium
hoppy
character
with
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
there
is
mild
to
heavy
carbonation
and
a
light
body
that
leaves
your
mouth
feeling
wet
as
opposed
to
a
dry
finish
overall
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
much
to
this
beer
especially
compared
to
long
trails
dipa
ive
had
much
better
ipas
i
had
this
beer
because
it
was
abandoned
in
my
fridge
i
doubt
id
purchase
one
a
bit
malt
heavy
refreshing
in
comparison
to
the
now
ubiquitous
trend
toward
ultrahopped
american
ipas
whose
dreadful
mission
it
is
to
pucker
the
lips
of
all
mankind
d
very
drinkable
ipa
this
will
fit
nicely
into
my
regular
rotation
for
session
beers
smooth
and
light
enough
to
enjoy
on
a
nice
warm
day
poured
a
light
gold
with
a
frothy
white
head
nice
retention
from
what
i
can
see
poured
in
a
plastic
cup
terrible
i
know
floral
citrus
smell
but
very
malty
as
well
a
little
flat
tasting
up
front
finished
by
a
kick
in
the
mouth
from
the
hops
nicely
balanced
with
a
little
grapefruit
and
malt
slightly
bitey
mouthfeel
but
finishes
smooth
i
like
this
one
and
in
the
past
i
wasnt
a
big
long
trail
guy
m
d
a
spritzy
carbonation
over
a
slightly
slick
body
i
quite
enjoyed
having
a
sixpack
of
this
and
i
will
miss
it
as
it
is
the
last
one
i
am
reviewing
from
and
i
wont
be
able
to
pick
it
up
again
until
i
return
to
new
jersey
in
august
hopefully
there
will
be
reason
to
head
to
an
area
its
available
between
now
and
then
solid
beer
and
worth
picking
up
d
without
knowing
that
its
5
9
abv
i
would
deem
it
an
excellent
session
beer
although
5
9
isnt
all
that
high
its
enough
feel
is
light
but
with
enough
body
to
not
be
watery
good
carbonation
keeps
the
flavors
evolving
very
drinkable
and
maybe
a
new
staple
for
the
summer
d
the
long
trails
i
have
had
are
all
very
drinkable
and
this
one
is
the
same
i
dont
know
if
ill
search
it
out
but
i
wont
turn
it
down
prickly
on
the
tongue
but
creamy
as
well
this
is
very
drinkable
the
hops
arent
too
over
the
top
malt
character
balances
well
a
nice
offering
from
long
trail
pours
a

color
with

fingers
of

disappointing
for

much

an
off

in

an

id
look
for
in

a

take
on
an

very
malty
apparently
this
is
more
in
the
english
mode
guess
im
more
of
an
american
ipa
fan
the
appearance
is
very
cloudy
yellowishorange
far
from
the
translucent
copper
tone
im
more
accustomed
to
being
unfiltered
the
yeasty
taste
overtakes
the
hops
with
a
slight
banana
flavor
sometimes
completely
overtaking
any
bitter
citrus
undertones
the
nose
is
pretty
disappointing
more
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
white
than
an
ipa
its
drinkable
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
overall
i
enjoyed
this
ipa
a
fair
bit
there
are
many
others
that
have
much
more
depth
to
their
flavor
though
not
a
bad
beer
to
try
but
not
one
i
can
see
myself
having
too
often
drinkability
i
could
easily
drink
this
ipa
all
night
without
tying
my
stomach
in
knots
better
than
keiths
worse
than
meantime
or
blackheart
d
not
outstanding
for
the
style
but
none
the
less
a
beer
which
i
could
drink
a
few
of
d
i
found
this
very
drinkable
not
the
best
ipa
ive
had
but
its
a
good
one
pours
a
hazy
bright
orange
sort
of
like
blue
moon
with
a
14
cm
head
that
holds
up
prety
well
to
time
with
good
lacing
aroma
is
a
little
stale
of
grains
and
light
floral
hops
im
not
too
familiar
with
english
ipas
but
this
seems
to
live
up
to
a
good
example
of
the
style
description
as
a
tweaked
pale
ale
a
lot
of
nice
malt
character
and
body
with
a
good
balance
with
the
flavoring
hops
nowhere
even
near
the
blistering
hop
presence
in
the
american
versions
i
think
this
would
be
great
out
of
a
cask
d
a
quaffer
ipa
that
drank
more
like
a
light
pale
ale
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
color
that
glows
in
the
light
a
small
white
head
rests
atop
leaving
consistent
notching
moderate
nose
of
sweet
cascade
hop
subtle
roasted
malt
and
a
fresh
crackery
yeast
character
great
balance
throughout
a
bit
soapy
at
times
but
overall
bright
in
quality
hop
flavor
with
an
excellent
medium
mouth
feel
and
a
long
bitter
aftertaste
drinkability
is
high
on
this
one
the
definition
of
sessionable
i
highly
recommend
it
d
an
ok
combination
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
leads
to
the
beer
being
pretty
drinkable
the
beer
could
use
a
little
bit
more
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
sweet
malt
but
overall
a
pretty
good
ipa
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
unique
ipa
for
sure
long
trail
needs
to
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
with
this
one
its
way
too
short
on
hops
and
overall
flavor
the
nose
suffers
a
great
deal
just
from
its
blandness
overall
not
very
good
i
wont
be
a
repeat
visitor
ive
had
better
ipas
but
for
the
price
this
a
good
beer
its
definitely
a
regular
in

drinkability
overall
a
pretty
good
ipa
that
is
a
good
companion
to
some
lighter
dishes
like
seafood
or
an
antipasto
not
better
then
some
other
pales
on
the
market
but
a
very
good
stab
at
the
style
refreshing
and
hoppy
just
right
ranting
aside
if
you
want
to
try
a
mild
drinkable
ipa
that
isnt
trying
to
push
the
envelope
give
this
one
a
whirl
really
weak
ipa
not
really
very
hopped
at
all
more
of
a
fruity
pale
ale
that
being
said
it
isnt
bad
smells
average
little
bit
fruity
tastes
a
little
hoppy
but
pretty
mellow
for
an
ipa
some
fruit
comes
through
in
the
taste
along
with
spices
average
ipa
there
are
far
better
ones
out
there
i
like
this
ipa
interpretation
for
its
lack
of
filtration
and
malt
base
not
a
fan
of
the
dish
soap
though
d
not
very
hoppy
at
all
and
ipas
usually
hit
my
mouth
and
stomach
hard
but
i
could
take
this
one
in
stride
very
drinkable
beer
there
is
a
very
strong
and
fresh
hop
taste
that
hits
nicely
but
because
of
the
appearance
of
the
malts
and
wheat
there
is
a
better
balance
to
this
beer
than
most
i
p
a
this
beer
is
much
more
drinkable
than
the
average
i
p
a

very
well
done

my
humble
opinion
done
of
the
more
drinkable
ipas
out
there
i
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
good
i
was
suprised
at
how
well
it
compared
to
most
other
beers
i
will
definitely
consider
buying
this
beer
in
the
future
it
poured
a
beautiful
hazy
amber
it
smelled
of
pleasant
hops
tasted
refreshing
without
being
to
heavy
or
light
tasted
unlike
any
other
ipa
and
i
could
probably
drink
five
or
six
of
these
without
switching
overall
a
really
good
ipa
after
all
the
ipas
ive
tried
this
local
one
is
stlll
one
of
my
favorites
for
11
9912
pack
its
a
great
deal
as
well
a
super
hoppy
beer
with
a
great
aroma
and
taste
beautiful
color
with
nice
lacing
and
a
great
mouthfeel
all
around
just
a
great
beer
dont
drink
and
review
d
easy
to
drink
but
not
an
outgoing
ipa
drinkability
yeah
i
could
drink
these
all
night
with
a
bottomless
stomach
points
off
for
heavy
residual
yeast
otherwise
a
5
in
this
catagory
d
this
is
uberdrinkable
i
had
to
do
a
double
take
when
i
saw
my
glass
half
empty
after
the
first
couple
of
minutes
if
youre
looking
for
a
not
too
intense
easy
drinking
ipa
this
is
it
driving
back
from
robinson
the
other
day
i
had
to
stop
for
gas
off
the
imperial
exit
of
2230
so
i
figured
why
not
take
a
gander
at
what
was
available
at
essex
beer
distributor
to
my
surprise
long
trail
brews
are
now
available
in
the
pittsburg
market
and
now
my
decision
was
split
between
the
harvest
brown
ale
ipa
bottle
on
8408
their
award
winning
hefe
or
the
elusive
double
bag
strong
ale
i
was
feeling
hops
and
im
glad
i
side
with
this
one
at
just
under
30
bucks
that
is
quite
a
value
pours
a
light
bright
slightly
clouded
orange
hue
head
forms
nice
and
thick
depending
on
how
vigorous
you
land
it
in
the
glass
anyway
a
great
collar
of
foam
forms
thick
at
the
upper
edge
of
my
chalice
while
even
lacing
streaks
a
formed
with
each
sip
after
aromatics
provided
herbal
citrus
and
earthy
notes
upfront
however
is
some
grapfruit
peel
with
soothing
tea
like
edges
i
love
nugget
hops
sweetness
comes
through
as
well
but
no
with
the
typical
cloud
of
caramel
this
one
has
a
much
more
clean
biscuit
light
sweetness
going
on
with
some
sugar
coated
hop
action
very
nice
flavor
is
mellow
with
hop
bitterness
but
hop
flavors
like
citrus
peel
and
earthy
herbal
qualities
flow
throughout
each
sip
moderate
amount
of
dry
bitterness
finish
is
typical
with
really
no
malt
sweetness
in
the
end
just
citrus
peel
quality
of
the
nuggets
balanced
and
more
englisheast
coast
but
its
so
damn
enjoyable
who
cares
if
it
doesnt
take
a
layer
of
enamel
off
of
my
teeth
mouthfeel
is
solid
crisp
bitter
hops
and
sweetness
with
a
dry
hop
finish
sticking
around
followed
by
welcoming
hop
burps
drinkability
this
brew
is
definitely
case
worthy
im
glad
i
decided
to
pick
up
a
case
blindly
without
thinking
its
only
rated
a
b
on
beeradvocate
damn
good
and
a
nice
introduction
to
what
im
sure
is
a
quality
craft
brewing
company
i
like
this
english
style
ipa
seems
to
be
on
its
way
to
being
an
american
style
with
the
nice
hop
bite
good
easy
drinker
i
would
like
to
revisit
sometime
this
was
the
4th
long
trail
beer
ive
tried
so
far
a
pretty
nice
ipa
copper
color
with
a
relatively
small
offwhite
head
aroma
wasnt
the
greatest
however
slightly
woody
and
grassy
very
flavorful
sweet
malty
taste
with
a
nice
amount
of
hops
but
nothing
out
of
the
norm
for
the
style
pours
a
hazy
yellow
light
orangeish
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
fresh
hops
like
smelling
a
bag
of
hop
flowers
in
the
taste
big
on
the
fresh
hops
and
balanced
with
a
good
english
malt
a
hop
bite
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
fresh
hop
aftertaste
nice
fresh
hop
aroma
and
taste
color
threw
me
off
but
a
nice
mellow
ipa
this
brew
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
very
onedimensional
with
a
few
off
flavors
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
easily
but
there
is
a
very
long
list
of
other
ipas
i
would
have
over
this
one
dits
okay
i
had
several
this
session
before
moving
on
overall
a
pleasant
beer
and
solid
new
england
local
but
nothing
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
this
seems
to
be
the
case
with
most
of
long
trails
offerings
lately
i
tasted
this
one
last
year
and
found
it
significantly
better
based
on
memory
dactually
pretty
good
im
a
big
long
trail
fan
double
bag
and
hefeweizenumm
and
was
all
excited
about
a
lt
ipa
however
i
was
disappointed
while
drinking
it
due
to
its
rather
uneventful
flavors
but
before
i
new
it
the
beer
was
gone
so
it
cant
be
that
bad
also
seems
like
it
has
a
lower
abv
then
advertised
as
it
nothing
to
drink
multiple
lt
ipas
lately
been
drinking
smuttynose
ipa
possibly
i
contribute
the
somewhat
bland
flavor
of
the
lt
ipa
and
over
all
weak
feeling
abv
due
to
my
overexposure
to
smutty
overall
lt
ipa
is
avg
in
my
mind
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
will
reach
for
smuttynose
ipa
when
they
are
side
by
side
in
the
cooler
d
i
think
that
this
was
an
old
bottle
based
on
other
reviews
but
i
could
be
wrongit
was
acquired
in
a
recent
trade
i
could
drink
several
of
these
even
with
the
off
flavors
drinkability
a
nice
ipa
not
great
but
definitely
does
the
trick
recommended
notes
a
decent
ipa
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
if
you
throw
it
in
front
of
me
ill
take
the
bait
there
is
something
wrong
with
this
beer
bad
bottle
a
descent
ipa
but
not
my
favorite
i
would
consider
this
a
good
session
beer
d
drinkability
is
good
flavors
are
mild
and
balanced
like
i
would
expect
from
an
english
ipa
the
aroma
could
have
used
a
tad
more
malt
and
sweetness
to
balance
the
hops
but
that
isnt
really
a
dealbreaker
for
this
beer
the
alcohol
is
low
and
stays
hidden
well
enough
to
drink
a
few
of
these
good
solid
beer
from
long
trail
d
not
a
powerhouse
ipa
but
very
satisfying
and
drinkable
in
quantity
the
hops
bitterness
lingers
and
is
nice
not
super
hoppy
and
overall
a
pretty
refreshing
ipa
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
hop
overload
but
instead
long
trails
traditional
unfiltered
ipa
goes
down
crisp
and
was
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
drink
a
six
pack
of
these
or
more
in
one
night
which
usually
isnt
the
case
for
me
when
it
comes
to
ipas
da
nice
tasty
version
of
the
style
i
would
get
this
again
if
brooklyns
ipa
were
not
available
more
often
and
a
slight
bit
better
pretty
drinkable
as
well
drinkability
this
is
more
of
a
3drink
beer
as
with
most
ipas
d
the
rest
of
the
beer
doesnt
stack
up
to
the
initial
appearance
its
a
pretty
generic
ipa
and
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
one
tolerable
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
short
and
medium
bodied
tan
head
that
laces
the
glass
ok
on
the
way
down
the
aroma
is
of
some
sweet
malts
and
then
piney
and
then
citrisy
hops
the
taste
is
good
nice
malty
base
underneath
a
very
piney
and
citirsy
hoppy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
fresh
feeling
which
makes
the
drinkability
very
good
a
fine
ipa
d
this
is
ok
but
there
are
better
choices
out
there
check
out
fullers
deuchars
or
st
peters
to
get
a
better
idea
of
what
this
style
is
capable
of
d
big
thanks
to
drdogbeer
for
this
unique
ipa
ive
never
had
anything
quite
like
it
and
it
was
a
real
treat
thanks
tom
basically
it
wasnt
bad
a
nice
cloudy
orange
pour
with
a
pale
yellow
head
that
stuck
around
for
most
of
the
glass
lacing
is
evident
and
left
rings
around
the
glass
anywaysmell
was
not
as
hoppy
as
i
thought
it
might
bekinda
pine
scent
but
got
better
once
you
tasted
it
as
far
as
drinkablility
is
its
not
bad
going
down
hangs
around
a
bit
over
all
pretty
nice
beer
price
22
99
philadelphia
area
nice
price
for
a
nice
beer
drinkability
is
good
this
would
be
a
nice
summertime
session
beer
or
lawnmower
beer
i
could
drink
a
lot
more
than
one
as
an
english
ipa
i
have
had
better
but
not
a
bad
beer
overall
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
eipa
to
drink
a
few
of
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
it
wouldnt
normally
be
my
first
choice
but
i
wouldnt
be
too
disappointed
if
i
were
to
be
stuck
with
it
as
my
best
option
had
this
one
in
their
winter
pack
man
was
this
good
appearance
was
classy
murky
bright
gold
color
with
a
good
solid
head
the
smell
was
quite
sharp
with
aromas
of
citrus
and
definitely
hops
the
taste
was
a
bit
too
polished
not
too
bitter
not
too
sweet
the
mouthfeel
was
great
at
first
awesome
carbonation
with
some
great
fizzy
bubbles
rushing
upward
through
the
glass
however
i
felt
once
i
was
half
way
through
it
was
getting
kind
of
flat
overall
this
is
one
heck
of
a
good
ipa
from
my
wonderful
green
mountain
neighbor
to
the
north
d
a
dull
beer
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
kick
but
i
guess
that
makes
it
drinkable
this
is
from
a
winter
mix
pack
i
bought
up
at
the
shaws
pours
a
very
hazy
cloudy
orange
color
looks
promising
not
much
smell
a
faint
citrus
might
be
weakly
smelling
or
my
sinuses
blocked
as
usual
tastes
a
lot
better
a
nice
cirusy
hoppy
flavor
that
stands
out
very
well
especialy
if
compared
to
their
normal
pale
ale
good
mouthfeel
overall
i
am
impressed
not
the
greatest
ipa
ive
had
but
it
is
really
good
and
flavorful
if
i
see
this
on
the
store
shelves
i
will
go
get
it
again
recommended
12
oz
bottle
into
tulip
glass
a
cloudy
orangeyellow
small
amount
of
head
that
retains
to
a
caked
on
layer
some
sparse
globs
of
lacing
s
the
hops
are
on
the
citrusy
side
nothing
to
intense
in
there
lighter
malts
t
really
solid
hop
profile
with
a
slightly
bitter
dry
finish
very
simple
and
clean
m
smooth
perhaps
a
tad
thin
d
i
think
this
is
a
really
nice
simple
ipa
good
balance
nothing
too
aggressive
the
finish
is
particularly
nice
and
its
opening
up
more
of
the
hop
profile
as
i
continue
through
the
glass
i
may
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
up
a
sixpack
but
its
a
solid
offering
and
id
probably
buy
it
if
i
saw
it
overall
i
like
this
beer
and
think
that
it
is
a
good
beer
but
i
dont
think
that
it
should
be
considered
an
english
ipa
because
the
hops
seem
too
american
and
too
aggressive
i
also
think
that
the
malt
characteristics
should
show
through
a
little
more
than
it
does
the
yeasty
esters
were
englishish
enough
though
pours
an
orange
haze
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
grapefruit
and
some
citrus
notes
taste
is
well
balanced
not
too
bitter
at
all
nice
hop
flavors
citrusy
grapefruit
light
lingering
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
really
thin
but
perfect
carbonation
very
smooth
easy
drinking
session
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
imo
there
is
a
burning
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
that
i
am
not
enjoying
very
much
overall
its
an
ok
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
pick
up
again
if
i
had
a
choice
pours
a
totally
fogged
in
gold
with
no
head
after
it
sits
for
a
short
while
nose
is
kind
of
airy
thin
with
a
touch
of
mild
orange
extremely
faint
pine
hop
character
comes
through
after
it
sits
for
several
minutes
flavor
is
odd
for
this
style
i
think
orange
citrus
is
fairly
heavy
on
there
slight
salt
there
hop
influence
yes
but
overall
fairly
mild
for
some
reason
the
flavor
profile
and
feel
remind
me
of
a
witbier
feel
is
sticky
on
the
liquid
and
good
with
the
bubble
on
the
tongue
overall
it
is
drinkable
for
sure
due
to
the
smooth
experience
it
delivers
nothing
flavor
fantastic
but
still
well
made
the
last
f
the
vermont
sampler
was
the
ipa
pours
a
lightmed
gold
w
a
thin
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
in
my
nonic
a
citrusy
hop
aroma
w
a
faint
fruity
alcohol
undertone
a
thin
flavor
a
decent
hop
bite
but
not
much
afterwards
a
rather
thin
mouthfeel
as
well
much
lighter
than
most
ipas
ive
had
and
a
tad
overcarbonated
not
an
undrinkable
beer
just
not
a
standout
ipa
overall
this
was
a
solid
offering
and
something
that
i
probably
would
not
have
picked
up
had
it
not
been
sent
to
me
i
am
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
it
was
a
little
more
then
your
average
run
of
the
mil
ipa
but
if
you
were
to
think
of
this
as
a
pale
ale
i
would
put
it
down
as
excellent
either
way
this
would
make
a
fine
staple
and
an
excellent
sessionable
selection
very
nicely
done
and
a
good
solid
call
drinkability
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
an
average
head
and
some
floating
yeast
the
smells
is
mostly
sweet
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
the
flavor
is
dry
with
some
fruity
hops
and
some
banana
flavor
coming
through
and
finishes
of
rather
crisp
the
mouthfeel
is
average
and
the
drinkability
ok
i
would
probably
have
enjoyed
this
more
on
a
warm
day
as
opposed
to
a
20
deg
snowy
night
pours
a
cloudy
orange
slight
off
white
thick
head
nice
lacing
left
on
the
glass
when
the
head
receded
mild
hop
aroma
in
the
nose
nice
taste
of
grapefruit
upfront
not
too
bitter
but
a
decent
presence
finished
with
a
taste
of
sourdough
good
mouthfeel
not
too
much
carbonation
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
sessionable
ale
a
nice
addition
for
long
trail
who
imho
has
a
tendency
to
keep
brewing
its
standard
ale
and
slapping
different
labels
on
it
not
a
bad
representation
for
the
style
though
i
prefer
brooklyns
take
on
the
english
ipa
a
solid
ipa
nothing
that
knocked
my
socks
off
but
a
good
beer
d
i
like
this
a
lot
its
hoppy
but
balanced
goes
down
smooth
and
is
absolutely
delicious
a
murky
yellow
body
with
a
small
white
fluffy
head
as
the
head
goes
downthere
is
some
lacing
head
falls
to
a
cap
that
take
up
the
whole
top
of
my
glass
nice
lace
marks
where
i
take
my
sip
all
the
way
down
the
glass
smell
of
citrus
and
some
malty
goodness
the
taste
is
a
toned
down
cascadish
tastenot
overpowering
in
any
way
clean
aftertastei
cant
really
put
where
i
taste
the
malt
at
in
this
beer
you
sorda
have
to
pull
to
get
a
good
smell
the
worst
part
about
this
beer
is
the
watered
down
taste
all
in
all
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
i
wont
be
going
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
untill
they
make
some
changes
after
drinking
the
lt
variety
pack
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
relief
because
i
was
tiring
of
the
malty
sweetness
of
the
other
beers
this
is
a
fairly
clear
light
amber
color
maybe
a
little
offyellow
it
is
medium
bodied
with
some
head
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
is
the
high
point
with
a
nice
hoppy
pine
smell
and
oily
esters
the
taste
does
not
live
up
to
the
very
aromatic
smell
in
that
there
is
a
malty
sweetness
and
a
weak
hoppiness
for
an
ipa
there
really
isnt
enough
going
on
in
this
beer
to
draw
much
interest
but
the
aftertaste
is
mild
and
the
mouthfeel
is
inoffensive
other
than
the
relative
hoppiness
which
came
as
a
nice
change
up
in
comparison
with
the
other
beers
in
the
variety
pack
this
one
is
decent
but
uneventful
just
like
their
hefe
weizen
it
took
me
a
few
sips
to
truly
start
enjoying
this
beer
i
think
it
might
be
the
yeast
that
i
find
a
bit
strange
but
i
could
be
wrong
it
has
a
piny
citrusy
and
malty
taste
also
some
fruits
are
noticeable
reminding
me
of
their
hefe
once
again
it
is
very
refreshing
im
glad
to
have
a
couple
more
d
i
like
this
one
very
much
it
was
included
in
the
variety
pack
i
picked
up
and
it
was
the
best
of
the
bunch
i
have
had
alot
of
ipas
and
this
is
one
of
my
recent
favorites
pour
into
a
pint
with
a
copperamber
color
very
clear
almost
clean
looking
head
was
highly
carbonated
whitenot
very
big
but
stayed
consistent
throughout
about
a
14
inch
smell
was
distinctive
pine
and
floral
undertones
taste
was
pleasent
mild
hops
yet
not
underdone
bitter
on
the
end
highly
drinkable
definitely
an
ad
all
day
ipa
leaned
more
towards
a
apa
than
an
ipa
wouldnt
turn
this
down
but
wouldnt
actively
seek
this
one
out
overall
pleasing
long
trail
ipa
pours
a
hazy
light
copper
with
a
thin
head
aroma
is
mostly
hops
grassy
and
herbal
with
a
hint
of
citrus
rind
flavor
is
mostly
dry
with
some
hints
of
yeast
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
with
the
same
hop
flavor
as
in
the
aroma
nice
to
see
this
one
around
more
often
it
goes
well
with
the
thai
basil
dish
im
eating
overall
this
is
the
best
balanced
ipa
i
have
had
sea
hag
is
a
close
second
but
leans
towards
the
hops
very
drinkable
a
hazy
gold
color
with
an
average
sized
chewy
head
and
good
lace
it
smells
first
of
lemon
and
then
some
banana
and
floral
hops
the
taste
hits
first
with
a
lemon
crispness
also
with
the
mellow
hops
nicely
blended
in
for
a
sweet
velvetty
brew
with
very
tasteful
carbonation
highly
refreshing
stuff
with
a
touch
of
dryness
to
the
finish
well
balanced
though
the
accent
is
on
the
clean
crisp
treatment
that
is
quite
drinkable
great
effort
here
especially
as
a
summer
ipa
option
hops
are
not
real
strong
but
very
tastefully
present
for
sure
i
really
enjoy
the
taste
of
this
beer
pleasantly
bitter
but
not
too
much
so
i
would
have
guessed
northern
brewer
hops
but
their
website
says
they
used
nugget
and
cascade
good
balance
of
maltiness
and
hoppiness
the
flavor
of
the
malt
in
addition
to
the
lack
of
an
overthetop
hop
aroma
lets
me
know
this
is
an
english
ipa
as
opposed
to
an
american
one
lately
ive
been
in
the
mood
for
english
style
ipas
so
this
one
is
a
welcome
addition
to
my
current
goto
beers
i
find
it
pleasant
and
quite
drinkable
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
two
finger
head
and
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
aroma
of
grapefruit
and
other
fruity
notes
malty
bready
grapefruit
lemon
flavors
mix
well
for
a
great
taste
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
thick
and
carbonation
is
good
really
liked
this
one
does
not
leave
you
with
that
bitter
after
taste
that
most
ipa
have
good
session
beer
ive
been
sampling
this
one
for
the
past
2
months
an
excellent
brew
perhaps
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
some
like
my
wife
but
it
is
very
impressive
that
they
left
it
unfiltered
and
so
raw
theres
enough
malt
to
put
up
a
reasonable
defense
to
the
strong
hop
attack
a
true
and
unexpected
treasure
from
an
unexpected
source
d
very
drinkable
but
could
be
thinner
to
make
it
more
drinkable
d
the
fact
that
the
hop
profile
is
so
out
of
balance
hurts
this
beer
i
will
finish
the
sample
pack
but
that
is
about
it
overall
this
isnt
the
boldest
ipa
youll
have
but
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
flavor
and
drinkability
which
makes
this
ipa
one
of
my
favorites
ive
never
had
their
normal
ipa
but
im
assuming
this
one
is
better
because
its
part
of
the
brewmasters
series
a
mild
ipa
yet
refreshingly
different
from
the
norm
drinkability
oh
its
very
drinkable
indeed
quite
a
nice
warmweather
brew
dare
i
call
it
sessionable
this
beer
seems
to
be
lost
somewhere
between
a
pale
ale
hefeweizen
and
ipa
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
is
looking
for
a
different
take
on
the
ipa
style
nice
beer
overall
pours
a
nice
yellowishgold
in
color
with
a
finger
of
almost
fluffy
white
head
that
disappated
rather
quickly
leaving
spotty
lacing
smells
of
some
citrusy
and
floral
hops
and
biscuity
malts
fairly
average
but
nicely
balanced
taste
is
better
theres
a
decent
malt
backbone
here
but
the
hops
predominantly
floral
run
the
show
from
start
to
finish
the
malts
do
make
a
valiant
attempt
to
come
to
the
forefront
at
the
finish
but
are
stubborny
turned
back
by
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
nice
medium
body
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
at
this
abv
and
with
this
balance
i
can
confidently
call
this
a
good
session
brew
if
youre
looking
for
something
spectacular
keep
looking
but
if
you
want
a
nicely
balanced
and
enjoyable
ipa
here
it
is
pours
a
thin
head
that
holds
some
lace
down
the
glass
and
dissipates
by
the
end
aroma
is
pronounced
with
citrus
and
green
tones
taste
is
bitter
but
not
overwhelming
almost
too
little
for
an
ipa
appearance
is
hazy
with
light
orange
shade
very
clean
and
drinkable
overall
would
make
a
good
first
choice
for
ipa
virgins
i
wasnt
crazy
about
this
beer
at
first
but
now
that
im
taking
another
look
at
it
im
really
enjoying
it
tons
of
cascade
hops
without
the
massive
bitterness
against
a
beautiful
clean
spring
water
sort
of
backbone
very
nice
mouthfeel
for
an
ipa
this
is
really
nice
sweeter
with
the
yeast
and
some
real
nice
citrus
notes
i
agree
with
tempest
about
the
orangey
taste
that
is
there
the
sweet
flavors
fade
into
the
hops
for
a
hoppier
finish
very
good
quaffable
damn
its
like
this
was
mixed
with
orange
juice
im
used
to
citrus
hops
but
never
anything
so
orangelike
decent
bitterness
nothing
too
powerful
or
fun
but
the
flavor
is
still
full
of
juicy
hops
flavors
with
a
bit
of
biscuit
malts
in
the
background
a
bit
yeasty
too
as
its
unfiltered
which
is
a
nice
touch
drinkability
i
would
say
that
it
is
very
drinkable
for
an
ipa
if
you
want
something
that
is
representative
of
what
a
good
ipa
should
be
this
is
a
decent
choice
as
smooth
and
creamy
as
can
bevelvety
very
light
for
an
ipa
could
almost
pass
for
a
wheat
not
like
most
ipas
ive
tasted
very
light
pleasing
and
smooth
nothing
extremecould
drink
this
beer
all
day
long
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
most
drinkable
ipa
ive
ever
had
would
be
a
great
starter
ipa
pale
slightly
hazy
golden
color
not
a
lot
of
aromamuted
hops
at
best
slight
piney
aroma
to
it
good
malty
flavor
with
a
nice
underlying
hop
bitterness
lingering
bitterness
is
nice
as
well
decent
mouthfeel
to
ita
touch
of
creaminess
against
the
bitter
flavor
is
well
done
overall
a
good
beer
though
i
would
like
something
a
bit
bolder
probably
comes
from
the
full
frontal
hop
assault
i
am
used
to
a
nice
english
version
though
drinkability
ahhhh
i
tink
im
learning
i
dont
like
ipas
good
beer
if
you
want
ipa
i
just
dont
like
the
bitterness
at
the
end
i
dont
like
grapefruit
i
found
it
to
be
very
drinkable
hitchhiker
courtesy
of
tempest
a
minimalist
ipa
with
a
lagerish
taste
aroma
and
mouthfeel
its
a
lighter
colour
with
a
bit
of
grapefruit
colour
there
is
above
average
carbonation
and
powdery
citrus
aroma
maybe
the
unfilteredness
contributes
its
ok
but
still
below
average
a
fine
ipa
and
especially
suprising
to
me
since
i
am
not
all
that
fond
of
long
trails
other
offerings
notes
i
reviewed
this
beer
based
on
the
characteristics
as
opposed
to
the
style
guidelines
because
of
the
differences
i
mentioned
had
this
on
tap
for
the
first
time
after
enjoying
several
bottles
over
the
last
few
months
it
came
to
my
table
brilliantly
clear
unlike
the
bottled
version
and
with
a
frothy
enduring
head
smells
of
wonderfully
fresh
malt
and
hops
well
balanced
but
still
a
good
hop
presence
now
my
second
favorite
long
trail
brew
after
double
bag
perfectfly
balanced
and
unfiltered
to
boot
kick
ass
im
kind
of
split
down
the
middle
with
long
trail
but
this
happens
to
be
one
i
could
drink
a
keg
of
well
responsibly
of
course
but
really
this
beer
is
an
awesome
sessionable
ipa
that
doesnt
destroy
your
palate
pours
a
cloudy
golden
thin
white
head
decent
retentionand
good
lacing
smell
is
of
fruitand
candywith
a
nice
edge
of
hops
body
is
mediumwith
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
this
was
truly
a
unique
beer
for
me
taste
is
fruited
almost
like
a
hefe
but
has
the
hops
flavor
of
an
ipa
excellent
this
stuff
is
good
it
poured
a
nice
foamy
white
head
and
had
a
golden
coloring
had
a
good
malty
smell
to
it
too
with
a
nice
crisp
and
refreshing
taste
on
the
first
sip
you
the
malts
first
and
quickly
following
is
the
strong
hops
theres
nothing
incredibly
special
about
this
beer
id
say
its
an
average
ipa
but
average
is
fine
by
me
worth
a
shot
light
bodied
pleasant
enough
nice
aftertaste
definitely
dont
have
to
choke
it
down
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
row
but
no
real
wow
factor
should
be
considered
a
regular
pale
at
best
a
nice
beer
just
not
a
great
one
especially
for
style
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
always
think
to
myself
that
i
should
pick
up
but
usually
move
on
to
something
else
pours
a
cool
golden
color
with
a
really
enticing
creamy
white
head
reminiscent
of
the
retention
on
a
guinness
draught
it
also
sticks
right
uo
until
the
bottom
which
is
pretty
cool
in
my
book
oily
hops
dominate
the
aroma
with
some
apple
rind
as
well
as
a
slight
mustyness
in
the
background
a
good
dosage
of
fruit
hits
the
palate
first
followed
by
the
hops
which
seemed
a
bit
more
accentuated
in
the
smell
but
still
nowhere
near
being
weak
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
making
it
a
very
nice
session
brew
i
dont
get
a
chance
to
try
nearly
enough
english
ipas
so
im
definitely
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
this
is
probably
the
best
offering
ive
sampled
from
long
trail
this
one
really
seems
like
it
supercedes
their
regularly
rotating
ipa
why
not
make
this
one
a
year
round
poured
a
hazed
near
murky
light
gold
with
some
peach
colored
hue
a
thinner
quick
to
dissapate
white
head
atopmmm
fresh
nose
quite
piney
and
grassy
a
light
toastiness
underneath
bu
the
fresh
hops
are
the
show
here
pretty
yeasty
and
dry
upfront
the
hops
are
in
the
pine
needle
variety
flavor
wise
not
enough
citrus
quality
at
least
for
me
seems
a
bit
lackluster
compared
to
the
nice
hop
prfile
in
the
nose
its
a
decent
ipa
but
it
left
me
wanting
a
little
more
flavor
i
guessi
wouldnt
seek
out
again
quite
enjoyable
its
much
fuller
and
rounder
than
the
crisper
filtered
version
hopefully
this
will
become
the
yearround
ipa
d
at
5
6
this
beer
is
not
too
terribly
high
on
the
scale
helping
the
drinkability
the
hops
and
malts
work
well
together
creating
a
flavorful
ale
a
very
nice
offering
i
would
drink
this
with
cheese
and
crackers
or
as
a
nice
pairing
for
hors
doeuvres
hour
at
a
party
try
this
if
you
are
looking
for
a
new
ipa
everything
here
has
been
done
before
but
it
does
it
all
credibly
if
without
any
spectacular
fanfare
its
a
bythebook
ipa
thats
moderate
in
its
hoppiness
but
fundamentally
tasty
it
drinks
smoothly
and
well
i
wont
shout
its
praises
but
i
have
no
issues
with
finishing
this
and
enjoying
more
when
i
come
across
it
long
trail
has
brought
this
beer
on
full
time
and
as
for
an
ipa
i
think
it
needs
a
little
work
not
much
hop
character
to
speak
of
pours
a
clean
amber
color
with
not
much
head
could
have
been
from
the
pour
clean
taste
with
decent
mouthfeel
a
good
middle
fo
the
road
i
would
say
but
it
if
it
was
on
sale
but
some
others
have
a
much
more
decent
flavor
taste
and
smell
i
e
harpoon
or
southern
tier
looks
like
an
ipa
slightly
redtinged
golden
color
with
a
great
poofy
head
smell
is
hoppy
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
which
is
slightly
surprising
very
sweet
smelling
as
well
quite
floral
honey
notes
taste
is
quite
lovely
not
as
hoppy
as
youd
expect
and
again
quite
sweet
some
spices
in
there
some
floralness
some
citrus
notes
a
unique
ipa
mouthfeel
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
but
is
chewy
enough
to
not
be
a
letdown
overall
quite
nice
pours
a
beautiful
bright
gold
hazed
with
yeast
with
minimal
head
very
pretty
beer
aroma
is
big
and
citrusy
with
ruby
red
grapefruit
and
blood
oranges
the
palate
displays
big
bitterness
up
front
but
not
so
big
as
to
be
unbalanced
light
malt
flavors
at
the
midpalate
and
very
distinctive
grapefruit
at
the
finish
light
on
the
tongue
but
still
substantial
enough
to
earn
the
term
beer
this
is
a
solid
session
brew
and
one

i
had
this
on
tap
at
ri
ras
in
burlinton
vt
this
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
large
white
head
the
smell
is
light
malt
with
some
hopsbut
not
as
much
as
you
would
think
the
taste
has
some
hops
but
none
of
the
bitterness
of
other
ipas
this
is
like
a
starter
ipa
or
a
light
ipa
the
mf
is
light
and
well
balanced
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
and
i
think
ill
enjoy
another
cheers
musings
a
very
drinkable
and
satisfying
beer
however
the
hops
really
take
over
a
little
more
pronounced
malt
base
here
would
result
in
a
wonderful
beer
d
an
all
around
good
beer
id
like
to
see
it
more
often
a
richer
flavor
than
their
regular
ipa
very
easy
to
drink
a
glass
full
of
hoppy
joy
thanks
to

beer
though
overall
a
pretty

ipa
nothing
spectacular
but
it
does
the
job
theres
a
lot
better
else
out
there
though
so
i
dont
see
why
youd
necessarily
seek
this
out
unless
your
options
are
extremely
limited
drinkability
extremely
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
pick
up
a
sixpack
and
enjoy
you
wont
be
blown
away
but
this
is
a
nice

ipa
d
def
drinkable
would
get
it
with
a
meal
though
d
well
measured
doses
of
hops
paired
with
just
enough
malt
make
this
one
quite
an
easy
drinker
after
getting
slammed
with
so
many
dipas
recently
this
one
was
a
very
welcome
change
the
addition
of
the
yeast
to
this
ipa
adds
a
new
dimension
of
drinkability
in
the
same
way
it
works
for
a
good
hefeweizen
this
easy
drinking
hoppy
beer
is
not
as
bitter
as
other
hop
monsters
its
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
feel
but
very
drinkable
id
recommend
grabbing
a
six
pack
before
its
all
gone
overall
its
ok
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
long
trail
brewmasters
limited
edition
is
overselling
it
pours
a
hazy
copper
yellow
with
and
truly
is
unfiltered
as
the
last
ounce
or
so
of
my
pour
splashed
some
yeast
into
the
mix
with
a
quarter
inch
head
and
a
fresh
piney
hop
aroma
this
ipa
seems
truly
inviting
although
it
seems
tame
when
compared
to
some
of
the
california
hop
monsters
ive
been
going
through
recently
it
has
a
very
smooth
initial
melon
citrus
flavor
followed
up
with
an
enjoyably
hoppy
finish
this
has
left
essentially
no
residual
foam
rings
on
the
pint
glass
and
doesnt
have
the
sticky
feel
that
many
other
ipas
have
a
very
enjoyable
and
incredibly
drinkable
ipa
here
ill
definitely
be
going
back
for
more
this
offering
from
long
trail
poured
hard
out
of
the
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
dark
blonde
body
with
some
small
yeast
floating
around
and
leaves
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
about
112in
thick
the
head
is
sticky
frothy
with
giant
bubbles
throughout
the
nose
of
this
brew
is
suttle
faint
grape
grassy
essence
followed
by
a
hint
of
morning
dew
and
flowers
after
a
heavy
rain
the
taste
is
average
it
starts
bitter
on
the
palate
then
moves
to
a
slight
watery
sweetness
like
the
juice
of
a
melon
and
finishes
with
a
lemon
rind
bitterness
overall
decent
brew
i
guess
on
tap
from
the
brewery
is
far
superior
so
ill
have
to
try
and
update
my
review
i
paired
this
beer
with
a
grilled
sirlion
baked
then
grilled
sweet
potatoe
and
sweet
peas
the
earthy
flavors
in
the
ipa
paired
nicely
with
steak
and
the
rustic
flavors
in
the
sweet
potatoe
overall
an
ok
ipa
not
stellar
but
worth
a
try
ll
have
to
pick
another
bit
of
this
up
before
its
gone
tasty
and
easy
drinking
this
would
be
great
in
the
spring
the
beer
poured
golden
in
color
that
was
effervescing
with
bubbles
and
had
a
big
bubbly
and
well
sustained
head
as
i
was
soon
to
find
out
the
lace
trail
left
behind
was
fantastic
the
nose
is
out
of
this
world
the
freshness
of
it
can
just
drive
you
crazy
the
hoppiness
is
pronounced
but
its
the
unbelievable
freshness
of
those
hops
thats
undescribable
while
it
displays
a
medium
body
the
hop
explosion
on
the
palate
is
unavoidable
grapefruit
and
citrus
notes
blend
well
with
the
breadlike
freshness
theres
that
word
again
the
straight
out
of
the
brew
kettle
feel
that
it
gives
you
is
literally
tangible
the
finish
is
puckering
and
slightly
dry
but
not
overwhelmingly
theres
just
enough
of
a
lemon
kick
to
remind
you
whos
boss
outstanding
wish
that
i
bought
more
than
the
2
bottles
nice
stuff
very
quenching
ill
have
to
pick
up
a
sixer
before
its
gone
i
dont
recall
their
normal
ipa
being
this
good
although
i
havent
had
it
in
a
while
maybe
i
should
revisit
it
if
this
is
the
same
recipe
very
good
but
i
can
imagine
getting
bored
of
this
if
i
drank
it
all
the
time
simplistic
approach
but
it
gets
the
point
across
and
its
plenty
satisfying
exactly
what
i
wanted
after
a
long
day
overall
a
decent
ipa
this
could
be
best
described
as
a
gateway
ipa
it
seems
long

is
vermonts
micro
for
the
beer
neophyte
as
is
flying

and
saranac
ny
otherwise
a
nice
session
beer
that
you
can
throw
back
several
a
bit
more
flavor
and
balance
would
improve
this
ipa
still
not
bad
at
all
and
a
welcome
permanent
addition
to
the
long

overall
this
is
a
good
ipa
it
possesses
the
great
qualities
an
ipa
should
have
it
is
a
very
pleasent
and
enjoyable
beer
it
has
a

it

ibu
long

india
pale
ale
poured
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
snow
white
head
the
head
was
about
a
finger
thick
but
thinned
quickly
the
thinner
head
stayed
throughout
the
pint
and
left
lacing
down
the
entire
glass
the
smell
was
almost
nonexistent
a
few
earthy
hop
tones
but
nothing
pronounced
and
much
less
robust
than
i
expect
from
an
ipa
the
taste
went
along
with
the
smell
nothing
jumped
out
not
malty
but
also
almost
no
hop
flavor
this
beer
seems
more
of
a
standard
english
bitter
than
an
ipa
light
hop
notes
and
not
sweet
but
in
no
way
an
ipa
the
mouthfeel
was
average
as
was
the
drinkability
an
unfortunately
uninspired
ipa
this
is
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
not
sure
it
is
strong
enough
or
hoppy
enough
to
warrant
the
ipa
moniker
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
fine
brew
i
bought
my
case
at
the
brewery
and
was
told
it
was
the
unfiltered
variety
that
was
served
at
a
recent
brew
fest
all
the
labels
were
affixed
upside
down
to
set
it
apart
from
the
filtered
variety
i
would
buy
and
drink
this
one
again
go
ahead
and
give
this
one
a
try
but
dont
expect
a
flavourful
hop
bomb
this
one
is
a
clear
golden
brew
with
a
one
inch
head
the
aroma
is
of
hops
and
is
a
bit
spicy
to
the
nose
its
flavor
is
hopy
but
is
dulled
a
little
bit
by
the
malt
the
hops
do
not
realy
come
out
until
the
aftertaste
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
and
is
generously
carbonated
it
goes
down
easy
as
this
is
not
an
in
your
face
ipa
i
think
that
they
should
take
off
the
statement
on
the
bottle
that
says
one
of
the
hoppiest
brews
in
the
states
blasphemy
this
beer
is
decent
my
review
sounds
really
negative
so
far
but
in
the
field
of
american
ipas
it
doesnt
even
get
an
honorable
mention
d
id
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
but
it
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
it
was
fine
to
drink
but
i
wouldnt
buy
another
six
pack
i
would
like
to
try
a
pint
from
the
tap
to
see
if
the
taste
improves
and
whether
the
bottle
i
tried
was
spoiled
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
a
difficult
one
to
review
even
as
a
pale
ipa
no
caramel
malt
which
is
quite
legit
it
seems
to
miss
the
mark
by
using
a
very
neutral
base
malt
fairly
clean
yeast
and
not
enough
hops
on
the
other
hand
it
is
a
refreshing
and
crisp
beer
that
is
pleasant
to
drink
in
trying
to
be
fair
i
am
giving
this
one
a
high
drinkability
rating
now
unfiltered
flavorful
and
drinkable
all
around
easy
to
sit
around
and
have
a
few
of
these
some
fruity
flavors
chime
in
here
and
there
which
is
nice
to
see
a
nice
change
of
pace
in
the
face
of
all
the
hop
bombs
that
are
being
brewed
lately
not
bad
just
curious
enough
to
leave
it
off
my
own
recommended
list
this
is
a
very
good
ipa
imo
pours
a
beautiful
copper
with
white
head
tasted
hoppy
not
the
hoppiest
ive
had
but
just
enough
that
it
went
great
with
the
general
tsos
chicken
i
was
eating
at
the
time
i
couldve
had
a
few
more
of
these
and
will
definitely
be
purchasing
this
one
again
goes
great
with
spicy
food
light
goldencopper
with
a
nice
head
of
white
foam
aromas
are
of
sweet
malts
and
subtle
hops
certainly
not
a
very
hoppy
aroma
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
and
more
esb
like
than
ipa
like
this
is
definately
not
one
of
the
hoppiest
beers
in
the
state
it
wasnt
even
one
of
the
hoppiest
beers
of
the
night
mouthfeel
is
decent
drinkability
is
ok
not
very
impressive
this
was
a
very
good
beer
one
i
would
gladly
drink
several
of
if
the
opportunity
arose
medium
bodied
there
are
better
local
ipas
but
this
is
solid
this
is
not
an
overthetop
style
ipa
rather
this
is
a
tasty
english
ipa
style
from
a
solid
microbrewery
in
vt
drinkable
for
the
style
but
i
wouldnt
waste
my
time
having
another
one
this
is
just
a
very
bland
beer
imo
something
to
pass
on
not
a
true
ipa
while
theres
a
little
bite
to
this
ipa
it
is
not
a
particularly
robust
or
hoppy
entry
into
the
american
micro
market
which
makes
it
most
decidedly
an
english
ipa
it
pours
a
light
orange
amber
the
aroma
has
some
citrus
and
hops
but
it
is
fairly
light
the
taste
is
undistinguished
fluttering
malts
a
touch
of
hops
with
some
lemon
and
pine
in
the
background
and
offset
by
mellow
carbonation
smooth
and
drinkable
but
thin
this
is
an
easy
drinking
mellow
brew
but
it
is
definitely
not
one
of
the
hoppiest
brews
in
the
states

what
were
left
with
is
a
decent
tasting
brew
but
not
quite
an
ipa
tastes
more
like
a
hoppy
summer
brew
a
very
intersting
ipa
to
say
the
least
im
glad
this
is
the
only
bottle
of
this
one
that
i
brought
back
from
vermont
amber
with
a
white
head
that
doesnt
hang
around
floral
and
slightly
piney
hoppy
aroma
with
sweeter
grainy
malt
characteristics
as
well
nothing
special
with
the
taste
seems
a
little
off
balance
with
hops
dominating
usually
not
a
bad
thing
but
it
doesnt
work
well
here
theres
not
enough
else
to
make
it
satisfying
a
little
thin
bodied
but
not
watery
enough
to
ruin
anything
a
decent
beer
that
im
not
gonna
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
if
in
vermont
and
i
see
it
on
tap
i
will
probably
give
it
another
try
72404
wow
i
had
never
tried
their
ipa
and
i
have
to
admit
i
was
really
impressed
the
label
on
the
bottle
announces
it
as
one
of
the
hoppiest
beers
we
know
and
i
was
sort
of
hesitant
but
i
gave
it
a
shot
i
loved
this
beer
it
had
a
clean
amber
appearance
and
a
great
hop
aroma
it
really
was
a
very
hoppy
beer
with
that
great
tongue
lashing
that
lets
knows
you
are
getting
a
well
brewed
ipa
i
need
to
find
it
on
tap
or
head
up
to
vt
and
check
it
out
straight
from
the
brewery
i
used
to
hold
this
brew
in
higher
esteem
i
will
have
to
try
again
soon
just
to
make
sure
this
wasnt
just
a
bad
batch
long
trail
india
pale
ale
is
a
letdown
it
isnt
terrible
beer
but
it
commits
three
major
ipa
sins
too
low
on
hops
noticeable
alcohol
and
a
toolight
body
thanks
to
a
great
ba
mikeys01
for
the
bottle
beer
pours
as
a
nice
golden
amber
color
with
a
good
sized
nice
off
white
head
that
takes
its
time
fading
away
to
lacing
the
smell
is
of
what
i
believe
to
be
spice
and
fruit
very
pleasant
the
taste
is
very
hoppy
on
my
pallet
and
over
all
good
for
an
india
can
say
that
it
is
my
least
favorite
from
the
mixed
12
pack
but
over
all
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
would
not
turn
one
down
dont
think
that
i
would
go
out
just
to
purchase
this
brew
but
having
it
once
in
a
while
would
not
be
bad
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
eventually
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
hops
and
carapils
malts
there
seems
to
be
a
slight
maltiness
too
it
that
balances
nicely
with
the
hops
its
a
mild
hop
scent
the
taste
is
decent
it
is
a
bitter
beer
with
good
hop
flavor
it
is
a
bit
piney
but
not
too
bad
it
also
mixes
well
with
the
malt
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
not
bad
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
sessions
ale
a
decent
ipa
long
trail
brewing
company
has
produced
a
good
ipa
though
not
one
that
id
drive
to
the
new
england
to
buy
again
lt
pours
amber
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
its
aroma
is
quite
sharp
and
pleasant
reminding
me
of
my
mothers
spice
cabinet
from
years
ago
it
starts
crisp
with
plenty
of
hoppy
goodness
and
a
bit
cinnamon
flavor
it
is
medium
to
full
bodied
without
even
the
slightest
bit
of
smooth
character
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
its
obviously
hopped
to
the
point
of
no
return
the
finish
is
dry
abrasive
and
very
bitter
finally
an
ipa
that
even
i
can
like
this
probably
tastes
like
dog
water
to
real
hop
heads
light
honey
color
with
a
low
beige
frothy
head
fine
lacing
down
the
glass
as
i
drink
aroma
is
low
but
floral
hop
and
sweet
fruit
can
be
detected
flavor
is
delicate
with
a
surprisingly
low
hop
profile
some
pear
and
apple
and
a
piney
finish
lingering
aftertaste
is
a
bit
metallic
which
detracts
overall
many
other
stronger
ipas
to
choose
from
dirty
white
head
that
left
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
is
along
the
lines
of
sweet
butterscotch
hops
light
copper
colored
beer
nice
and
clear
there
is
a
lot
of
diacetyl
in
the
flavor
with
a
little
bit
of
citrus
hops
and
a
lightly
bitter
aftertaste
the
body
is
middle
of
the
road
and
fairly
light
i
prefer
a
bit
more
hopiness
in
my
ipas
its
not
bad
just
not
all
that
great
not
my
type
of
ipa
i
generally
like
the
beers
this
brewery
makes
but
i
would
not
buy
this
again
gotta
thank
my
sis
in
one
of
these
reviews
she
picked
up
a
case
of
mixed
vermont
beers
for
me
on
her
travels
out
east
and
this
is
the
last
i
have
to
review
from
it
nice
hoppy
aroma
and
decent
color
dark
yellow
gold
very
nice
hop
smell
with
a
semitart
taste
that
lingers
just
the
right
amount
of
time
hopped
but
not
to
the
point
of
distraction
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
enough
body
to
be
wellrounded
not
the
hoppiest
ipa
but
very
drinkable
pours
a
pale
amber
with
a
small
white
head
one
of
the
most
hoppy
brews
in
the
states
naw
but
the
hops
are
quite
up
front
and
tasty
a
decent
brew
but
not
an
ipa
to
call
friends
about
stick
with
one
of
the
maltier
brews
offered
by
long
trail
the
taste
is
sweet
light
crystal
malt
and
upfront
with
hop
bitterness
that
takes
over
as
if
an
aggressive
hop
was
used
for
bittering
but
not
flavor
this
makes
it
seem
to
have
the
bitterness
but
not
alot
of
hop
taste
the
taste
of
hops
comes
at
the
end
where
a
sticky
hop
lasts
to
the
end
the
malt
is
over
ruled
very
interesting
in
how
this
happens
when
looking
at
specs
pale
ale
and
ipa
have
an
overlap
between
high
and
low
of
the
ibus
this
beer
sits
in
that
range
which
appeals
to
me
as
a
pale
ale
fan
beef
up
the
malt
and
not
the
abv
and
this
be
great
otherwise
its
good
and
i
enjoyed
it
not
one
of
the
hoppiest
brews
in
the
states
but
definitely
a
drinkable
ipa
with
a
healthy
wallop
of
bitterness
that
sits
on
the
front
rather
than
the
back
of
the
tongue
some
slightly
citric
resinous
hop
flavor
but
it
did
not
make
me
want
to
drink
more
i
dont
know
exactly
what
it
is
but
this
beer
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
didnt
really
like
it
but
this
is
just
sad
to
call
this
an
ipa
is
strange
i
can
tell
you
what
would
i
call
it
and
a
nice
crisp
hop
finish
i
find
this
to
be
quite
drinkable
without
being
a
hopmonster
or
highly
alcoholic
not
that
i
have
a
problem
with
those
on
par
with
harpoons
version
of
an
ipa
good
brewery
by
no
means
the
bodys
on
the
light
end
of
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
giving
it
a
good
crispness
and
smoothness
but
it
ends
slightly
thin
this
is
my
first
encounter
with
magic
hat
aside
from
9
this
ale
pours
s
handsome
hazy
amber
color
with
a
thick
and
lasting
slightly
off
white
head
it
leaves
a
slight
amount
of
lacing
and
has
nice
legs
to
it
the
aroma
is
quite
weak
but
had
notes
of
hop
and
citrus
mostly
lemon
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
some
subtle
malts
underneath
it
is
a
good
tasting
beer
but
nothing
special
i
hope
that
magic
hat
has
more
to
offer
than
just
this
overall
not
bad
but
certainly
not
was
i
was
hoping
for
im
a
little
disappointed
by
this
offering
from
magic
hat
ive
had
a
few
of
their
sample
packs
before
and
have
been
impressed
by
their
style
this
ipa
is
too
strong
with
citrus
hops
like
a
stronger
version
of
9
except
more
lemon
and
less
grapefruit
next
time
ill
stick
to
their
black
ipa
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
cloudy
orange
amber
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
smells
of
grain
and
slight
floral
hints
tastes
of
ale
yeast
and
citrus
notes
very
nice
combination
beer
is
carbonated
a
little
heavily
and
is
light
bodied
could
possibly
be
sessionable
overall
a
very
good
beer
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
when
i
want
an
ipa
though
i
really
want
a
spicy
exciting
flavor
profile
that
showcases
hops
hops
should
be
obvious
in
both
aroma
and
taste
and
i
think
the
blind
faith
misses
the
mark
on
that
note
pours
a
murky
dark
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
fruity
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
sour
citrus
zest
and
malt
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
with
an
unexpected
sour
flavor
that
is
throwing
me
off
of
what
would
otherwise
seem
to
be
a
decent
example
of
the
style
o
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
seem
to
be
a
bit
muted
for
an
ipa
even
when
compared
to
english
ipas
nonetheless
its
quite
easy
to
drink
not
unpleasant
but
not
huge
or
complicated
either
more
middle
of
the
pack
for
its
class
a
decent
beer
for
the
style
i
kept
trying
to
remember
that
its
not
an
american
ipa
but
an
english
ipa
the
basic
9
was
the
best
of
the
four
in
this
variety
pack
i
havent
had
much
luck
with
magic
hat
offering
in
the
past
but
this
rotating
ipa
was
a
surprise
winner
right
out
of
the
bottle
it
had
a
textbook
ipa
appearance
and
an
inviting
nose
the
taste
was
very
well
balanced
and
yet
distinctly
an
english
ipa
very
well
crafted
i
would
buy
this
again
especially
since
i
was
paying
only
around
a
buck
a
bottle
with
the
variety
pack
it
came
in
o
i
was
very
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
it
looks
great
it
drink
great
but
the
flavors
and
aroma
just
arent
there
almost
more
of
a
pale
ale
id
drink
it
again
or
session
it
but
there
are
so
many
better
offerings
out
there
73
this
is
an
okay
english
ipa
the
beer
looked
and
smelled
better
than
it
tasted
once
again
magic
hat
doesnt
totally
impress
mf
smooth
and
light
bodied
dry
finish
moderate
carbonation
transfered
to
goblet
from
bottle
tried
again
after
tgiving
same
impression
cloudy
muddy
look
muddy
flavor
profile
definitely
more
english
in
style
and
farmy
but
a
good
winters
ale
not
as
bright
as
better
ipas
this
beer
has
a
semi
complex
personality
and
while
not
an
amazing
ipa
by
any
means
is
still
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
many
will
find
it
too
light
and
too
basic
to
take
seriously
but
its
really
not
a
bad
ipa
and
is
worthy
of
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance
seems
a
bit
over
carbonated
to
say
the
least
and
whether
this
is
the
reason
or
not
the
malts
and
or
hops
tastes
are
to
light
im
new
to
drinking
ipas
but
this
one
is
quite
enjoyable
the
appearance
is
a
light
orangetan
and
holds
a
thin
white
head
this
beer
has
a
noticeably
hoppy
smell
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
was
surprisingly
good
to
me
the
initial
taste
is
a
bit
citrus
with
a
bite
and
the
after
taste
is
appropriately
bitter
from
the
hops
this
ipa
is
not
overly
bitter
like
some
of
the
others
i
have
tasted
no
complaints
with
the
mouthfeel
overall
id
give
this
beer
a
3
as
i
mentioned
im
new
to
ipas
and
so
far
this
is
the
first
ive
enjoyed
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
a
friend
overall
i
held
out
hope
that
this
would
be
a
more
restrained
ipa
without
club
you
over
the
head
hops
and
perhaps
it
might
have
been
but
it
would
be
impossible
to
tell
given
the
sourness
problem
cant
recommend
this
magic
hat
blind
faith
35
overall
not
the
greatest
ipa
ive
had
but
does
provide
a
more
unique
fruity
experience
rather
than
a
bitter
overall
complexion
overall
overall
a
disappointment
i
remember
it
much
more
fondly
than
it
actually
is
i
have
also
had
some
amazing
brews
since
having
one
of
these
so
it
has
a
lot
to
live
up
to
magic
hat
is
owned
by
north
american
breweries
who
owns
several
brands
who
dont
care
about
craft
beer
such
as
genesee
and
labatt
usa
but
i
figured
since
it
was
a
subsidiary
it
might
not
brew
subpar
i
was
wrong
and
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
brew
or
the
brewery
in
general
overall
better
than
i
had
expected
based
on
reviews
its
kind
of
like
a
fusion
of
english
and
american
styles
id
drink
it
again
my
first
english
ipa
pours
and
appears
a
dark
orange
cloudy
low
head
tannic
ale
smells
sweet
really
and
floral
and
some
citrus
but
not
hop
prominent
like
american
ipas
taste
is
roasted
malt
and
caramel
and
some
citrus
bitter
all
modulated
by
a
really
busy
and
creamy
and
effervescent
mouth
to
the
beer
fun
to
try
still
give
me
more
hops
there
are
so
many
fantastic
ipas
out
there
that
it
is
a
hard
category
to
compete
in
even
with
a
top
beer
thus
beer
easily
places
well
above
other
styles
but
as
an
ipa
ill
have
to
place
it
only
above
average
nice
clean
amber
with
a
tight
froth
and
the
welcome
hop
aftertaste
it
only
lacks
an
aromatic
nostril
sting
ive
come
to
expect
with
ipas
especially
double
ipas
but
i
dont
think
that
was
their
brewing
intention
nice
beer
would
i
buy
it
next
time
no
not
because
it
aint
good
but
there
is
a
lot
of
excellent
stuff
available
out
there
o
this
is
a
solid
ipa
a
little
weird
being
the
english
style
a
little
bit
of
a
step
outside
the
box
def
worth
trying
though
besides
the
sweet
finish
i
liked
it
a
lot
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
has
a
little
too
much
cardboard
with
a
medium
body
mild
carbonation
and
an
overall
grainy
feel
overall
it
was
ok
nice
for
the
style
and
flavorful
enough
that
id
have
it
again
they
got
this
one
right
up
in
vt
final
thoughts
this
sort
of
tastes
like
an
apa
without
any
of
the
great
hop
flavor
ive
never
been
a
big
fan
of
english
ipas
since
the
american
version
does
a
much
better
job
with
the
hop
selection
but
this
one
is
basically
average
for
the
style
id
be
interested
to
try
the
other
magic
hat
ipas
but
i
wouldnt
go
for
this
again
o
overall
a
decent
ipa
though
more
on
the
malty
side
a
little
hoppier
in
the
taste
but
not
too
much
easy
to
drink
would
have
it
again
if
it
was
in
the
fridge
o
this
is
a
decent
english
ipa
that
adjective
in
front
of
the
ipa
is
an
important
one
anyone
who
is
expecting
a
hop
presence
similar
to
american
ipas
doesnt
understand
what
english
ipas
are
and
will
be
sorely
disappointed
sure
theres
a
more
subdued
hop
presence
with
more
earthy
and
floral
notes
but
that
is
to
be
expected
with
this
style
theres
still
not
really
anything
special
here
but
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
o
not
a
huge
fan
at
all
but
then
again
magic
hat
not
expecting
much
aroma
has
a
hint
of
soap
like
childhood
bubbles
there
is
also
a
showing
of
pine
form
the
hops
the
flavor
is
pine
resin
and
there
is
some
faint
citrus
to
be
found
not
the
best
ipa
i
have
had
for
being
a
part
of
the
summer
variety
case
this
was
the
weakest
offering
with
the
proliferation
of
american
styles
its
nice
to
be
able
to
get
an
english
style
thats
done
well
this
fits
that
bill
there
are
those
mature
refined
tones
that
you
expect
well
rounded
hop
characteristics
but
not
pushing
it
to
the
levels
that
define
american
ipas
this
is
a
real
nice
easy
drinker
if
i
could
try
this
on
cask
id
be
all
over
it
o
this
is
decent
but
nothing
spectacular
im
not
sure
if
i
would
have
this
again
very
ordinary
nothing
to
write
home
about
just
lacks
character
like
it
doesnt
know
what
kind
of
beer
it
wants
to
be
goes
down
easy
enough
but
needs
more
bite
for
an
ipa
the
troops
of
lore
wouldnt
want
much
of
this
all
in
all
a
great
beer
to
buy
for
the
bottle
if
the
spot
next
to
9
on
the
frat
mantle
is
empty
not
worth
money
if
you
enjoy
craft
beer
and
anheuser
busch
doesnt
need
it
o
interesting
twist
on
the
style
and
definitely
worth
trying
its
not
often
i
find
an
english
ipa
on
the
shelves
good
but
not
something
i
will
seek
out
another
soso
beer
from
a
brewery
that
puts
out
a
lot
of
ho
hum
beers
despite
the
fact
they
often
use
unusual
ingredients
and
have
wild
and
crazy
labels
3
555
00
overall
this
is
an
impressive
effort
from
a
brewery
that
i
tend
to
hate
its
strong
for
an
english
ipa
but
tastes
pretty
darn
good
magic
hats
best
beer
overall
one
of
the
better
magic
hat
offerings
ive
had
wouldnt
consider
it
an
english
ipa
hops
were
more
american
in
style
malt
was
a
bit
overly
toasted
but
the
hop
complexity
was
very
nice
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
really
label
this
an
ipa
more
like
a
pale
ale
o
this
beer
is
very
much
mediocre
its
not
bad
but
it
just
doesnt
have
much
interesting
d
while
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
it
is
far
from
an
ipa
english
or
american
the
malt
character
is
subdued
and
too
sweet
for
the
style
while
the
hops
are
almost
completely
absent
until
the
finish
where
they
contribute
just
a
touch
of
flavor
and
bitterness
this
would
be
a
mediocre
pale
ale
or
a
decent
blonde
but
it
is
a
pretty
poor
ipa
originally
reviewed
07082011
overall
ok
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
southern
tier
ipa
stipa
and
stipa
won
hands
down
if
you
are
an
ipa
fan
you
might
not
think
this
is
enough
well
made
and
i
have
a
lot
of
respect
for
magic
hat
it
just
doesnt
float
my
boat
to
use
a
cliche
sorry
i
like
this
one
a
lot
in
summer
not
as
aggressively
hopped
as
a
lot
of
other
india
pales
this
one
is
very
well
balanced
by
some
english
and
american
malts
smell
is
quite
zesty
some
citrusty
hops
and
earthy
english
malts
flavor
is
nice
plenty
of
hops
in
the
finish
but
the
rest
of
the
time
they
are
quite
subdued
and
only
a
little
bit
bitter
this
is
more
of
a
session
ipa
than
anything
else
i
like
it
in
their
summer
mixed
12er
but
i
also
like
it
from
the
brewery
in
a
growler
hand
and
half
with
number
9
they
call
it
blind
9
and
its
an
excellent
blend
overall
this
ipa
has
a
place
in
my
annual
beer
calander
serves
a
special
function
in
summer
time
o
at
first
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
pretty
good
offering
from
magic
hat
i
usually
think
their
beers
are
innovative
and
a
little
bit
above
average
but
nothing
more
then
i
slowly
started
realizing
the
faults
of
this
beer
there
is
a
nice
fruitiness
to
this
beer
however
it
doesnt
balance
quite
right
and
the
more
you
drink
it
the
more
artificial
and
off
it
seems
this
definitely
has
a
taste
similar
to
the
9
from
what
i
remember
it
has
that
same
kind
of
apricot
artificial
taste
i
think
this
one
is
a
little
bit
better
though
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
worth
spending
12
and
getting
it
in
a
mixed
12
this
doesnt
even
compare
to
the
other
level
of
ipas
coming
out
of
vt
though
edit
ive
tried
the
most
recent
batch
and
refuse
to
believe
its
the
same
beer
whatever
is
in
bottles
now
is
not
what
i
had
then
this
is
the
beer
it
should
be
this
has
a
flavor
that
seems
to
run
through
most
of
the
magic
hat
beers
an
herbal
earthy
taste
its
a
style
but
i
find
i
like
those
flowery
hops
better
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
trader
joes
in
washington
dc
bitter
herb
and
bitter
orange
as
the
bitter
hops
roll
around
malt
is
faintly
in
the
background
but
does
not
show
up
enough
for
balance
the
hops
arent
good
enough
to
carry
this
one
on
there
own
this
is
a
good
beer
but
falls
short
of
craft
ipa
expectations
pours
a
dark
burnt
orange
color
with
a
rocky
off
white
head
that
stayed
solid
the
smell
is
sticky
caramel
sweet
with
loads
of
citrusy
hop
aroma
with
a
hint
of
pepper
taste
is
mainly
piney
hops
with
some
peppery
flavor
as
well
slightly
sweet
background
and
a
little
bread
its
light
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
hoppy
dry
finish
this
is
another
of
magic
hats
better
offerings
couldve
been
a
bit
more
balanced
though
dirty
copper
orange
in
color
with
a
deep
haze
poured
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
foam
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
that
left
rings
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
citrus
hop
ripe
pineapple
biscuity
malt
and
grassy
aromas
medium
bodied
with
a
light
resinous
feel
through
the
middle
and
assertive
carbonation
citrus
hop
flavor
with
a
biscuity
malt
backbone
from
beginning
to
end
finished
semidry
with
a
bready
and
light
bitter
pine
aftertaste
overall
a
pretty
basic
ipa
although
it
possessed
a
good
drinkability
it
did
not
have
any
outstanding
qualities
this
is
a
decent
ipa
it
definitely
has
some
hop
bite
to
it
the
malt
character
is
rather
subdued
so
in
the
end
the
beer
lacks
balance
just
a
little
more
malt
would
do
wonders
in
taming
the
intense
bitter
finish
its
worth
trying
nonetheless
its
one
of
the
better
magic
hat
offerings
o
not
bad
for
an
ipa
bitterness
isnt
too
potent
and
there
are
a
few
little
flourishes
that
make
it
a
nice
change
of
pace
overall
like
the
other
ipa
on
tour
beers
this
one
is
very
well
crafted
like
the
encore
and
hipa
better
but
this
one
is
not
bad
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
and
very
pleasant
ipa
im
really
enjoying
the
ipa
on
tour
by
magic
hat
some
good
stuff
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
series
thus
far
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
one
finger
of
cream
colored
foam
few
spots
left
on
the
glass
smell
orange
peel
earth
caramel
biscuit
not
very
pronounced
taste
orange
herbal
toffee
some
apple
skin
and
earth
in
the
finish
medium
body
with
creamy
feel
so
basically
an
american
ipa
with
british
ale
yeast
none
of
these
hybrids
really
do
it
for
me
but
this
ones
not
bad
was
orangered
in
color
with
a
slightly
milky
head
does
not
seem
to
be
highly
carbonated
slight
pine
and
citrus
smell
but
not
much
at
all
tastes
of
grapefruit
but
slightly
watery
was
a
nice
mouthfeel
with
decent
amount
of
carbonation
but
finished
kind
of
watery
overall
though
i
did
enjoy
this
one
but
would
have
enjoyed
the
hops
a
little
stronger
i
expected
more
bitterness
than
i
got
not
a
bad
beer
but
im
not
the
fan
of
it
now
that
i
was
last
summer
looking
at
magic
hats
website
blind
faith
is
the
summer
ipa
on
tour
so
looks
like
im
a
bit
behind
the
curve
on
buying
and
drinking
this
one
still
a
good
beer
but
ill
should
pay
attention
a
bit
more
when
buying
out
of
the
way
bottles
at
a
liquor
store
that
i
dont
know
the
reputation
this
pours
a
light
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
one
finger
head
aroma
is
light
fruits
some
sugary
citrus
rind
and
a
little
pine
with
some
pale
malts
flavor
follows
with
light
sweetness
of
citrus
rinds
and
some
honey
a
bit
of
a
flat
flavor
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
with
medium
carbonation
finish
is
more
unpleasant
than
other
in
the
style
just
not
the
hop
profile
i
expect
from
an
ipa
plenty
drinkable
especially
when
i
was
back
in
college
starts
mildly
and
never
really
takes
off
finishes
better
as
flavors
emerge
but
its
unlike
most
ipas
ive
had
nothing
makes
it
bad
but
theres
not
really
enough
to
make
it
great
either
a
pleasant
if
average
beer
o
overall
a
very
average
beer
but
certainly
not
offensive
in
any
way
this
is
very
crisp
even
if
tame
refreshing
theres
some
rye
flavor
with
a
hop
underpinning
its
well
balanced
on
the
mouth
its
bubbly
and
tingly
very
nice
all
around
an
ipa
mixed
with
a
rye
nice
i
was
a
bit
surprised
that
i
liked
this
i
would
drink
this
beer
any
time
and
am
glad
i
picked
it
up
decent
but
a
little
dull
certainly
not
a
great
example
of
what
this
style
could
be
overall
a
pleasantly
drinkable
beer
o
sorry
for
the
short
review
but
there
wasnt
much
to
write
home
about
magic
hat
is
always
hit
or
miss
for
me
and
this
ipa
was
a
miss
i
bought
a
mixed
case
of
magic
hat
for
20
for
that
price
i
figured
whatever
lame
beer
that
was
insided
was
atleast
worth
20
this
mixed
case
is
worth
20
and
not
half
a
crown
more
this
beer
was
forgettable
and
not
very
good
became
kind
of
cloying
at
the
end
blech
i
guess
i
just
dont
like
ipas
i
bought
this
as
a
part
of
a
varity
pack
wouldnt
get
it
again
i
was
happy
to
see
this
beer
come
back
i
hadnt
tried
it
prior
to
its
retirement
but
when
it
was
rereleased
i
made
sure
to
get
some
not
sure
if
much
changed
because
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
anyway
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
on
top
the
head
is
a
little
sticky
and
leave
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
hoppy
there
is
a
touch
of
malts
in
the
background
of
the
nose
but
mostly
hoppy
aromas
dominate
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
quite
nice
its
an
easy
going
ipa
nothing
too
extreme
here
thatll
kill
your
taste
buds
or
anything
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
and
its
a
bit
refreshing
also
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
ipa
i
enjoy
it
o
run
of
the
mill
ipa
definitely
not
the
best
ipa
i
have
tried
nor
the
worst
nothing
really
special
or
something
i
would
grab
again
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
think
it
fits
the
category
perfectly
and
is
a
good
example
of
what
to
shoot
for
a
touch
more
malty
than
i
was
expecting
but
thats
true
to
style
and
not
to
my
brain
nutty
but
light
in
that
department
sweet
caramelbiscuit
hops
stir
things
up
a
bit
giving
more
zest
and
bite
this
beer
is
good
for
conversation
you
dont
have
to
think
about
it
until
its
gone
and
youve
talked
for
a
long
time
while
sipping
it
happens
overall
this
is
a
good
midlevel
ipa
bearing
many
of
the
trademark
flavors
and
aromas
of
the
style
but
lacking
such
finesse
and
creativity
as
would
set
it
apart
from
its
peers
overall
nothing
special
here
too
mild
and
weak
not
enough
complex
flavors
and
surely
not
enough
hops
malts
are
the
one
positive
about
this
beer
not
worth
drinking
again
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
amber
color
body
with
2finger
white
head
that
doesnt
hang
around
long
the
smell
is
a
bit
light
on
the
hops
and
a
little
spice
the
balance
of
hops
and
malt
is
nice
some
spicy
notes
comes
through
a
decent
mouth
feel
overall
a
decent
beer
it
is
not
my
favorite
of
magic
hat
ipa
tour
but
good
though
overall
not
a
good
beer
by
any
means
wouldnt
want
to
drink
again
thats
for
sure
its
a
more
drinkable
ipa
by
that
i
mean
it
has
good
balance
the
hops
are
not
through
the
roof
as
such
i
actually
find
this
quite
a
refreshing
ipa
nice
coppery
burnt
orange
with
a
decent
whit
head
some
lace
to
decorate
the
glass
and
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
evident
smell
is
mild
with
light
toffee
and
malt
some
buttery
notes
as
well
a
sweet
fruitiness
and
some
citrus
taste
is
more
of
the
nose
with
a
bigger
buttered
toastbiscuit
component
malt
gives
a
nice
grain
center
to
a
bright
and
leafy
hop
finish
dry
with
long
notes
of
hop
oil
and
grapefruit
skin
as
it
warms
the
malt
gets
bigger
and
gives
a
broader
platform
for
the
well
done
hops
to
shine
feel
is
a
little
light
but
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
with
a
touch
of
creaminess
overall
quite
drinkable
and
delightful
sessions
well
and
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
this
is
certainly
not
the
most
pungent
ipa
ive
ever
had
it
would
make
a
nice
entry
level
beer
for
someone
just
staring
out
in
the
craft
beer
community
again
like
the
sam
adams
latitude
48
overall
a
decent
and
very
sessionable
ipa
great
for
a
summer
night
outside
with
a
group
the
smell
leaves
something
to
be
desired
for
an
ipa
though
pours
a
clear
pretty
goldenorange
an
offwhite
head
laces
well
around
the
glass
smell
is
super
clean
hightipped
mellow
leafy
spices
mixed
with
sugars
taste
has
a
fair
amount
of
round
caramel
and
butterscotch
malts
quite
dry
contained
within
is
a
more
pronounced
litegrapefruit
hop
flavor
finishes
with
more
of
the
caramel
only
complaint
is
that
the
feel
stops
short
tasty
and
mildly
complex
just
another
ipa
but
a
good
one
i
have
recently
discovered
magic
hat
through
a
friend
and
have
been
fairly
pleased
so
far
the
beer
poured
a
mediumdark
amber
and
left
a
2
cm
or
so
head
which
disappeared
quickly
the
carbonation
was
nice
and
lacing
was
decent
as
well
the
smell
was
very
fresh
and
of
course
the
standard
hoppy
and
citrus
notes
were
present
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
crisp
and
any
movement
of
my
tongue
caused
the
beer
to
froth
immediately
the
taste
had
an
initial
sweetness
quickly
moving
to
hoppy
bitterness
i
would
put
this
in
the
midrange
for
ipas
its
a
nice
variation
and
very
drinkable
thanks
i
purchased
it
as
part
of
a
multipack
but
would
buy
a
6
of
this
if
handed
this
beer
at
a
party
i
would
happily
drink
it
but
wouldnt
think
twice
about
it
overall
its
a
notch
above
average
but
no
more
easy
drinking
ipa
tasty
o
this
is
a
nice
example
of
an
american
take
on
the
classic
english
ipa
not
hopped
out
of
its
mind
or
anything
too
crazy
just
a
nice
easydrinking
ipa
the
mouthfeel
is
middling
with
an
appropriate
level
of
carbonation
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
middle
of
the
road
ipa
tasted
pretty
good
on
a
cool
night
by
the
lake
i
did
not
expect
this
wow
this
was
a
very
nice
ipa
poured
a
amber
little
head
and
not
last
smells
of
bitter
hops
less
citrusy
than
i
thought
it
might
be
taste
is
of
bitter
hops
pine
resins
has
an
tacky
mouthfeel
my
least
favorite
part
of
the
beer
overall
really
nice
ipa
d
this
was
a
decent
ipa
but
nothing
special
the
scent
and
taste
were
enjoyable
but
not
the
cleanest
or
boldest
the
body
was
a
bit
weak
too
surprisingly
sweet
more
than
it
was
bitter
which
is
odd
for
an
ipa
hops
seemed
more
american
than
english
but
maybe
thats
just
me
easy
beer
to
drink
but
not
recommended
medium
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
a
pretty
average
ipa
but
drinks
pretty
cleanly
at
least
i
would
recommend
this
to
my
customers
who
want
to
explore
the
winding
alphaacidroad
that
is
ipas
hell
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
o
its
nice
to
see
an
ipa
that
doesnt
blast
your
taste
buds
off
with
massive
amounts
of
hops
overall
i
dont
think
this
one
measures
up
to
other
magic
hat
beers
that
i
have
tried
its
decent
but
thats
about
it
this
is
definitely
the
highlight
of
the
magic
hat
12
pack
offering
as
it
warms
the
hops
come
out
more
and
can
really
compete
with
some
quality
craft
ipas
it
also
tastes
pretty
unique
because
of
the
different
yeast
strain
they
use
with
the
very
leafy
hop
taste
i
usually
get
very
fruity
and
rich
tasting
ipas
but
this
is
more
crisp
and
herbal
which
is
a
nice
break
from
the
usual
ipa
so
pretty
much
if
you
want
a
bit
milder
but
different
tasting
than
the
rest
ipa
go
for
this
one
poured
out
a
deep
burnt
orange
a
small
amount
of
head
is
present
but
disappears
quickly
a
hefty
amount
of
malts
countered
with
some
citrus
floral
hop
notes
flavor
is
hops
right
up
front
a
lot
of
citrus
but
some
subtle
fruitiness
with
some
mango
and
melon
the
hops
are
backed
by
a
solid
toffee
malt
backing
a
small
diacetyl
taste
but
otherwise
balanced
well
finishes
with
a
hop
bite
but
it
doesnt
cloy
the
malt
takes
over
for
the
finish
making
this
a
beer
i
could
grab
a
bunch
of
at
the
bar
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
could
use
a
bit
more
malt
other
than
that
this
is
good
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
decent
lacing
and
head
retention
pleasant
scented
and
a
nice
hop
nose
very
easy
to
drink
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
should
be
year
round
like
it
was
but
still
worth
a
shot
overall
an
average
beer
but
seems
uninspired
not
a
bad
ipa
but
nothing
to
rave
about
i
will
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
6pack
in
a
session
at
the
pool
pours
a
three
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
very
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
clear
amber
color
lightmedium
carbonation

ma
do
drinkability
is
moderately
high
to
be
honest
this
beer
really
surprised
me
i
wasnt
expecting
much
at
all
as
i
havent
had
a
magic
hat
beer
in
a
while
but
i
was
surprisingly
content
with
this
offering
it
is
obvious
in
its
english
influences
and
its
balanced
to
the
point
of
almost
being
too
malty
but
the
flavors
are
nice
and
the
6
20
alcohol
is
completely
absent
drinkability
a
fairly
substandard
ipa
the
flavor
is
a
bit
weak
and
it
has
that
unfortunate
metallic
taste
that
pops
up
every
so
often
in
some
of
magic
hats
beers
magic
hat
is
pretty
hit
or
miss
for
me
with
a
few
great
beers
a
few
duds
and
a
lot
of
mediocre
ones
this
ones
a
dud
if
only
barely
skip
it
m

the
mouthfeel
was
nice
could
session
if
i
had
too
pours
with
a
generous
head
ample
lacing
looks
the
color
of
brewed
tea
not
an
overwhelming
smell
some
spice
and
bitter
hops
taste
is
bitter
hop
heavy
with
not
enough
balancing
malt
not
a
lot
of
subtle
notes
in
smell
or
taste
im
not
really
picking
up
any
of
the
nice
citrus
floral
or
grassy
notes
just
bitter
this
one
is
just
okay
to
me
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
it
either
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
really
solid

with
a
nice

and
great

nose
is
not
complex
but
piny

the

is
pretty

with

surprised
at
how
good
this
one
was
i
was
not
expecting
much
its
a
malt
first
ipa
but
has
great
bittering
hops
addition
that
works
it
was
tasty
overall
meh
nothing
really
stands
out
about
this
one
and
this
beer
is
distinctly
forgettable
not
as
bad
as
some
of
the
other
magic
hat
beers
but
still
a
reminder
why
i
never
buy
magic
hat
i
doubt
i
will
get
this
one
again
cheers
after
having
so
many
highly
hopped
american
ipas
it
is
good
to
try
a
more
subtle
interpretation
the
ale
is
very
quaffable
for
6
0
abv
but
coming
from
a
die
hard
hop
head
this
beer
just
does
not
do
the
hop
justice
not
a
bad
brew
easy
to
drink
and
one
to
just
sit
back
and
not
think
about
too
much
just
enjoy

relativley
clean
finish
seems
to

more
balnced
as
it
warms
grows
on
ya
not
bad
overall
its
not
a
bad
ipa
but
id
rather
go
with
a
few
others
o
i
like
my
ipas
with
more
of
a
fruit
flavor
this
seems
to
move
the
malt
to
the
front
still
a
good
drinkable
ale
finish
little
bitter
hops
with
some
maltyness
in
the
back
hey
its
balanced
it
works
id
try
it
again
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangeamber
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
grapefruit
but
is
very
faint
the
taste
is
of
grapefruit
with
a
little
orange
and
some
nice
bitterness
there
is
some
noticeable
cardboard
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
beer
seems
stale
to
me
however
the
date
on
the
bottle
reads
june
30th
2011
so
im
not
sure
what
to
make
of
that
it
is
still
decent
but
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
it
again
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
on
the
weak
side
for
bitterness
but
appreciable
for
the
low
abv
in
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
great
sipper
for
the
warmer
days
were
starting
to
see
here
in
the
northeast
enjoyable
if
somewhat
easy
for
an
english
ipa
it
is
almost
like
an
eipa
with
training
wheels
for
beginners
still
it
is
not
offensive
and
i
would
certainly
have
another
overall
i
wasnt
really
impressed
with
this
one
didnt
taste
much
like
any
type
of
pale
ale
sorry
magic
hat
but
this
one
wasnt
very
magical
overall
i
would
defiantly
recommend
this
beer
for
someone
new
to
the
scene
it
should
open
their
eyes
and
taste
buds
for
the
spicy
and
hoppy
beers
pretty
much
a
hollow
shell
of
its
former
self
it
is
ok
just
ok
there
are
many
other
ipas
that
have
raised
the
benchmark
a
lot
higher
than
this
beer
cheers
this
beer
has
a
nice
amber
color
with
lighter
red
undertones
good
white
head
with
good
lacing
the
smell
of
aroma
hops
to
this
ipa
i
would
not
expect
anything
less
from
and
ipa
especially
from
magic
hat
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
not
overly
bitter
like
some
ipas
it
is
very
well
balanced
i
really
enjoyed
the
balnce
of
this
beer
the
beer
was
full
bodied
and
overl
this
is
a
good
beer
to
try
and
is
a
very
good
ipa
pours
clear
dark
orange
in
body
with
white
bubbly
head
that
leaves
lacing
aroma
of
spicy
hops
and
lemon
zest
and
vague
apple
skins
tastes
of
spicy
hops
slight
veggies
some
echo
of
citrus
bitterness
comes
through
the
finish
leaving
a
lingering
orange
note
in
its
wake
medium
bodied
with
zapping
carbonation
drinkable
but
nothing
special
here
went
great
with
brazilian
black
bean
soup
what
the
hell
is
this
this
years
batch
tastes
like
watereddown
malt
liquor
with
some
grass
clippings
thrown
in
why
d
fairly
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
as
this
was
definatly
a
gulper
i
could
see
myself
throwing
down
quite
a
bit
of
these
to
be
honest
not
bad
at
all
but
pretty
average
drinkability
not
much
hop
flavor
a
mild
ipa
decent
break
from
a
hop
bomb
this
is
a
very
different
ipa
as
is
usual
with
magic
hats
style
it
has
a
typical
hoppy
smell
it
is
quite
bitter
with
the
hops
and
not
so
well
rounded
with
the
malt
but
still
has
a
very
good
flavor
the
bitterness
makes
it
have
a
slightly
worse
drinkability
than
other
ipas
i
have
had
poured
from
bottle
into
your
standard
pint
glass
has
a
nice
burnt
orange
color
and
the
look
of
an
unfiltered
wheat
beer
light
carbonation
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
smelled
of
fresh
citrus
hops
and
golden
malts
first
sip
reminded
me
a
lot
of
victory
hop
devil
great
hop
flavor
with
a
bitter
ending
good
citruspiney
hop
mix
with
minimal
malt
coming
through
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
could
get
a
case
and
never
be
tired
of
blindly
picking
one
of
these
out
of
the
fridge
leaves
my
mouth
feeling
quenched
with
a
slight
dryness
on
the
tongue
recomend
this
to
everyone
to
atleadt
try
once
i
used
to
really
like
this
beer
back
in
2004
2005
not
so
much
these
days
i
know
my
palate
has
changed
but
it
really
seems
this
beer
has
too
drinkability
is
very
god
its
not
for
everyone
but
a
very
good
backtothebasics
eipa
particularly
as
compared
to
its
other
bottled
contemporaries
its
a
shame
this
is
a
limited
release
not
to
come
back
until
whenever
the
hell
magic
hat
feels
like
bringing
it
back
id
session
the
hell
out
of
this
but
i
only
got
my
hands
on
three
bottles
that
ive
been
clinging
to
this
is
my
last
one
d
i
though
this
beer
bee
pretty
good
cuz
it
s
a
ipa
and
man
i
was
wrong
this
beer
sucks
and
i
was
hoping
for
sop
much
more
d
good
but
theres
no
balance
to
speak
of
dig
it
so
glad
to
find
this
beer
dlike
i
said
its
easy
down
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
wouldnt
be
a
problem
for
me
i
really
like
this
brew
thats
surprising
because
i
normally
find
the
magic
hat
brews
to
be
mediocre
at
best
good
job
guys
picked
this
up
in
a
sampler
6
poured
a
hazy
copper
with
thick
white
head
great
retention
and
lacing
smell
of
citrusy
hops
and
some
mild
bready
malt
taste
the
citrusy
hops
up
front
almost
an
offmetallic
taste
in
there
but
it
somehow
works
esters
cling
to
the
mouth
malt
comes
to
balance
at
the
finish
but
is
choked
out
by
the
hops
as
far
as
middle
of
the
road
drinkable
ipas
go
this
is
great
not
being
a
hop
hound
i
like
this
ipa
as
it
is
not
over
the
top
in
bitterness
slightly
oily
feel
to
the
palate
but
the
carbonation
help
cut
through
that
a
little
i
like
how
the
bitter
citric
lingers
in
balance
with
the
sweet
caramel
malt
after
each
sip
taste
is
pretty
light
nothing
overly
hoppy
but
pleasant
light
body
that
balances
fairly
well
with
a
fairly
citrus
and
earthy
flavor
this
beer
is
drinkable
and
but
it
doesnt
really
pair
with
anything
and
isnt
aggressively
good
cheers
overall
probably
my
favorite
magic
hat
brew
pours
yellowamber
with
no
head
and
a
slight
lace
ring
aroma
is
big
cascade
hops
that
smell
quite
fresh
and
fruity
apples
and
pears
that
continue
the
fruit
theme
though
not
as
prevalent
as
the
hops
and
a
light
caramel
malt
to
round
out
the
body
taste
is
dominated
by
apollo
and
cascade
hops
up
front
and
throughout
the
body
while
the
fruit
flavors
and
malt
come
through
a
bit
they
are
overpowered
by
the
hops
and
i
wish
they
were
a
bit
stronger
as
they
contributed
to
a
great
aroma
hoppy
and
smooth
ipa
mouthfeel
enough
bite
to
be
refreshing
but
nothing
extraordinary
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
solid
ipa
d
this
is
a
well
crafted
brew
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
magic
hat
the
hops
seem
mask
the
ringwood
flavor
thats
prominent
in
many
of
their
beers
its
nice
to
see
them
release
it
again
but
they
should
make
this
part
of
their
year
round
lineup
d
worst
part
of
the
beer
not
awful
but
not
even
great
for
the
style
the
aftertaste
doesnt
make
me
want
to
take
another
sip
an
enjoyable
brew
from
magic
hat
excellent
balance
of
hops
not
too
over
powering
but
enough
to
let
you
know
that
your
drinking
an
ipa
a
dependable
sort
of
beer
d
blind
faith
is
arguably
one
of
the
best
magic
hat
brews
ever
this
is
so
tasty
and
even
easy
to
drink
i
can
slam
a
sixer
without
even
knowing
it
d
makes
a
good
session
beer
managed
to
to
drink
a
few
in
one
sitting
overall
this
beer
was
solid
one
of
the
better
magic
hat
brews
ive
had
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
mh
but
this
beer
was
solid
not
a
superstar
though
and
one
that
i
would
drink
anytime
i
found
this
one
the
most
enjoyable
of
the
summer
pack
and
would
drink
it
anytime
overall
one
of
the
better
magic
hat
brews
i
have
ever
had
i
am
gaining
hope
for
them
once
again
assuming
the
other
ipas
on
tour
can
hold
up
bocce
ball
was
in
order
and
i
had
this
fine
beer
as
my
partner
d
this
is
a
nice
english
ipa
one
of
the
better
magic
hat
brews
that
i
have
had
to
date
im
glad
they
brought
this
back
for
a
short
time
its
certainly
better
than
lucky
kat
in
some
ways
and
worth
trying
while
its
still
on
shelves
d
good
drinkable
ipa
here
could
be
sessioned
but
falls
a
bit
short
of
the
mark
on
hop
forwardness
i
would
drink
this
again
though
cheers
ddidnt
like
the
taste
wont
purchase
again
d
drinkable
it
is
i
would
like
to
get
a
sixer
and
see
how
it
goes
good
drinkability
light
and
refreshing
overall
a
decent
beer
and
about
what
i
expected
out
of
magic
hat
pretty
hazy
paleale
copper
colored
brew
small
cream
colored
head
sticks
all
over
the
glass
scent
is
a
very
nice
fruity
hop
oil
scent
along
with
some
pale
malt
sweet
malt
front
lemon
and
citrus
notes
biscuit
some
bitterness
from
the
hops
but
it
gets
a
bit
lost
in
the
other
notes
medium
to
full
bodied
interesting
brew
it
is
a
drinkable
ipa
but
the
taste
is
not
as
clear
ans
sharp
as
other
ipas
is
not
my
first
choice
for
an
ipa
at
the
beer
store
overall
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
heavy
of
hops
taste
is
also
of
hops
with
some
malts
fairly
well
balanced
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
nice
amber
color
light
tan
head
veey
good
esthery
flavor
really
good
beer
i
like
this
one
and
have
often
contemplated
making
the
knockoff
its
fairly
well
balanced
but
again
its
an
ipa
so
hops
are
very
prominent
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
bit
of
citrus
but
seriously
where
are
the
hops
is
this
one
of
those
not
west
coast
ipas
from
back
in
the
day
that
use
to
rock
the
sox
off
the
jersey
boys
or
something
seems
commonplace
and
heavy
on
the
malt
and
wood
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
just
has
big
expectations
and
it
didnt
meet
them
pricey
for
what
it
is
i
just
couldnt
appreciate
theis
beer
as
much
as
i
wanted
maybe
too
unidimensional
it
was
ok
but
didnt
do
much
for
me
blind
faith
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
medium
sized
head
that
stayed
with
the
beer
throughout
it
had
a
little
bit
of
a
hoppy
smell
with
a
bit
of
a
strong
alchool
taste
it
had
a
smooth
taste
where
the
hop
flavors
and
alchool
flavors
balanced
out
not
as
hoppy
as
otheer
ipas
which
is
a
shame
but
still
a
very
good
and
different
taste
it
was
rather
easy
to
drink
and
had
a
strong
overall
flavor
overall
a
differnt
take
on
an
ipa
some
may
find
this
dissapointing
but
overall
a
very
nice
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
am
hoping
that
magic
hat
keeps
this
beer
in
there
line
up
this
beer
pours
an
orangey
copper
color
with
about
a
half
finger
of
light
head
it
smells
of
citrus
hops
with
a
bit
of
caramel
in
the
background
the
taste
is
similar
but
the
malt
character
has
a
larger
presence
balancing
the
hops
very
well
the
beer
is
very
smooth
but
i
would
say
a
bit
undercarbonated
for
my
tastes
drinkability
4
out
of
5
not
bad
at
all
its
rather
strong
on
the
hops
almost
as
if
someone
liquidated
an
entire
hops
farm
for
the
purpose
of
producing
this
beer
so
stay
away
if
you
arent
fond
of
hopheavy
beers
still
for
the
price
this
is
a
great
ipa
that
one
could
have
a
few
of
and
be
happy
d
wouldnt
buy
another
but
would
drink
pours
a
copper
caramel
color
that
is
slightly
lighter
on
the
bottom
and
a
little
darker
on
the
top
the
head
is
about
two
fingers
and
frothy
and
foamy
the
head
resides
to
a
half
finger
and
it
leaves
nice
gobes
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
with
a
ton
of
visible
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
breadiness
and
earthy
and
citrus
hops
it
also
has
a
slight
tea
aroma
to
it
the
taste
has
a
slight
tea
and
musty
yeasty
breadiness
at
the
front
end
it
took
me
a
while
to
get
what
the
taste
was
at
the
front
the
hop
bite
takes
place
in
the
middle
to
back
end
with
floral
and
citrus
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
but
very
smooth
the
drinkability
is
very
high
its
not
a
hop
bomb
like
some
ipas
but
more
smooth
and
mellow
the
taste
is
interesting
it
is
smooth
enough
and
an
easy
enough
drink
to
keep
you
drinking
it
notes
this
is
a
decent
all
around
ipa
easy
drinker
this
i
p
a
is
a
great
transition
beer
into
the
world
of
i
p
as
i
cant
wait
for
hi
p
a
to
return
in
the
autumn
of
this
year
pours
a
nice
amber
orange
with
moderate
head
and
lacing
the
beer
has
a
good
hop
aroma
with
a
light
earthiness
behind
a
slightly
fruity
hop
aroma
a
bit
of
malt
plays
behind
that
the
flavour
has
an
enjoyable
hoppiness
to
it
with
much
of
the
same
but
it
is
playing
much
more
towards
a
pale
ale
as
the
bitterness
is
too
light
for
my
liking
in
an
ipa
nevertheless
an
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
i
usually
like
ipas
so
it
was
no
surprise
that
i
liked
this
on
too
the
color
was
a
orangish
tan
a
bit
cloudy
the
smell
was
sweet
hops
the
taste
started
of
a
bit
bitter
the
faded
into
some
nice
hops
but
neither
of
those
2
flavors
were
too
extreme
but
well
balanced
a
bit
mild
a
easy
drink
for
a
hot
summers
day
i
am
glad
this
is
back
even
if
limited
a
great
beer
to
start
the
day
off
with
a
good
rep
of
the
english
ipa
d
good
eipa
id
say
try
it
especially
now
that
its
back
for
a
limited
time
but
lucky
kat
is
much
better
as
long
as
youre
not
looking
for
a
tongueslashing
ipa
you
could
do
far
worse
than
blind
faith
i
dig
the
balanced
nature
of
this
and
appreciate
the
fact
that
it
doesnt
remind
of
other
magic
hat
beers
many
of
which
are
good
but
a
bit
samey
and
it
goes
down
way
too
quickly
so
i
guess
drinkability
has
to
be
rated
on
the
higher
end
of
the
scale
drinkability
this
beer
would
make
a
great
session
beer
its
very
easiliy
drinkable
not
to
heavy
and
not
crazy
complex
but
just
easy
smooth
enjoyable
drinking
a
beer
at
a
great
prize
too
relatively
a
very
enjoyable
ale
one
you
would
drink
as
a
great
session
with
nice
flavor
and
easy
drinking
well
balanced
and
worth
another
look
again
glad
its
back
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
piney
hops
and
a
gingerbread
malt
in
the
taste
piney
hops
and
a
hint
of
grapefruit
a
small
bite
but
mainly
smooth
thin
mouthfeel
and
a
clean
with
a
small
hop
aftertaste
kind
of
thin
nice
hops
but
not
much
of
a
malt
balance
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
helped
get
me
acquainted
with
craft
offerings
nice
to
see
it
back
for
a
few
seconds
definitely
in
the
upper
quarter
of
middleoftheroad
ipa
category
i
was
glad
to
see
this
back
on
the
shelves
if
only
for
a
limited
time
blind
faith
was
one
of
my
gateway
beers
back
in
the
day
actually
magic
hats
entire
stable
was
pretty
much
my
gateway
upon
this
return
visit
it
definitely
seems
more
tame
but
that
used
to
be
the
very
reason
i
liked
it
it
was
just
about
the
only
ipa
i
could
drink
before
i
got
a
taste
for
hops
were
all
getting
a
little
spoiled
with
some
of
the
intensely
flavored
extreme
beers
and
mini
extremes
out
there
so
its
good
to
return
to
a
simpler
traditionally
inspired
brew
there
is
still
a
good
amount
of
hops
to
go
around
in
this
one
the
hop
profile
plays
off
the
buttery
aromas
and
sweet
flavor
notes
well
looks
good
and
is
very
drinkable
a
great
one
to
have
if
you
want
some
character
without
obliterating
your
palate
d
mild
body
a
good
easy
drinking
ipa
nothing
that
has
you
rushing
back
pours
a
hazy
orange
amber
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
ring
on
the
top
smells
of
tart
fruit
earthy
floral
hops
and
a
hint
of
caramel
taste
is
caramelish
toasted
sweet
malt
with
a
bitter
grapefruitorange
twang
to
it
long
lingering
citrus
fruit
bitterness
persists
long
after
each
sip
light
to
medium
body
resinous
watery
mouthfeel
medium
level
of
carbonation
i
thought
this
one
was
just
ok
while
there
was
nothing
objectionable
about
this
brew
there
was
also
nothing
noteworthy
here
either
its
certainly
drinkable
but
in
the
future
i
think
id
rather
spend
my
money
on
something
that
wasnt
so
boring
d
a
easy
drink
relative
mellow
for
an
ipa
not
to
be
sought
after
but
a
nice
drink
dm
good
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
but
not
too
strong
as
to
overwhelm
and
ruin
the
palate
the
taste
is
a
tad
biting
with
lots
of
leafy
and
slightly
harsh
hops
without
the
fruity
and
citrusy
burst
that
i
come
to
expect
there
is
a
subdued
citrus
bite
but
it
lacks
the
complementary
tang
to
make
this
a
truly
appealing
hop
bittering
expereince
the
dry
bite
the
slightly
harsh
herbal
texture
in
the
mouth
and
the
lack
of
some
stronger
bready
malts
in
the
mid
section
to
pick
up
some
slack
really
bring
out
the
flaws
in
this
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
but
it
is
okay
had
this
beer
for
the
first
time
when
i
went
to
the
magic
hat
brewery
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
ipas
normally
but
this
struck
me
as
a
great
beer
and
opened
me
back
up
to
the
world
of
ipas
first
thought
was
that
it
was
just
because
it
was
fresh
from
the
brewery
but
bought
a
mixed
pack
and
it
was
still
as
good
as
it
was
from
the
tap
an
after
thought
if
you
like
both
this
beer
and
number
9
do
a
12
combination
of
the
both
of
them
they
do
this
at
the
brewery
and
they
call
it
blind
9
its
a
great
combination
of
flavor
drinkability
its
got
a
good
drinkability
its
not
too
sweet
not
overly
bitter
and
not
too
boozeinfused
to
dissuade
me
from
downing
a
few
of
these
guys
off
the
tap
at
the
brewery
this
english
style
ipa
was
a
bright
copper
color
with
some
tangerine
highlights
that
appeared
when
held
up
to
light
the
head
was
slightly
offwhite
faded
quickly
and
left
thin
ringlets
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
blend
of
citrus
hops
and
herbalgrassy
hops
atop
a
crystal
malt
background
the
flavors
were
at
first
very
bitter
with
the
orange
rind
and
herbal
hops
elements
shining
through
clearly
however
there
was
enough
toasted
malt
and
hints
of
caramel
malt
to
give
the
beer
a
solid
backbone
and
balance
dry
and
just
a
little
toasty
clearly
english
in
style
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
good
as
with
all
magic
hat
beers
i
found
this
to
be
good
but
nothing
stellar
however
this
was
one
of
the
best
i
think
theyve
produced
in
a
while
and
i
did
enjoy
it
more
than
many
of
their
more
recent
offerings
props
to
south
burlington
i
was
interested
to
try
this
beer
a
because
i
have
a
nostalgic
soft
spot
for
magic
hat
having
briefly
attended
uvm
and
b
because
i
am
an
adventurous
hophead
with
insatiable
curiosity
in
new
ipas
very
simply
i
thought
the
smell
and
appearance
were
decent
but
uninspiring
and
the
taste
was
downright
disappointing
the
only
saving
grace
was
its
drinkability
cheers
to
magic
hat
for
bringing
back
what
may
be
the
first
ipa
i
ever
tried
blind
faith
pours
out
a
hazy
but
glowing
orange
color
lighter
than
i
remember
with
one
finger
of
white
heading
sweet
malt
comes
through
in
the
nose
followed
by
faint
hops
and
fresh
grains
the
hops
are
more
pronounced
in
the
taste
but
still
hold
a
milder
flavor
i
find
myself
wondering
what
types
they
are
using
and
if
they
are
english
there
is
also
some
biscuit
like
malt
flavor
and
just
a
hint
of
fruit
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
easy
on
the
palate
finishing
off
this
six
pack
should
not
be
a
problem
i
am
totally
on
board
with
mh
with
this
ipa
series
db
good
priced
ipa
with
a
pretty
good
flavor
the
bitters
and
hop
flavors
will
become
a
bit
much
if
sessioning
is
desired
balance
is
lost
even
more
with
each
sip
toward
the
end
of
the
glass
magic
hat
blind
faith
is
a
hazy
deep
golden
ale
with
a
thin
dense
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
a
floral
leafy
aroma
thats
almost
solventy
it
smells
like
hop
pellets
its
medium
bodied
and
pretty
soft
it
has
a
pretty
graceful
finish
but
it
does
leave
the
tongue
a
bit
ragged
after
a
while
its
quite
bitter
it
really
reminds
me
of
ballard
bitter
it
has
that
round
green
bitterness
that
leans
toward
juniper
its
pretty
well
balanced
with
some
peppery
malt
not
too
boring
not
too
bad
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sweet
bitter
and
spicy
overall
im
thinking
my
bottles
either
got
mislabeled
or
they
brewed
a
batch
where
they
forgot
to
do
any
hop
additions
tried
it
up
against
harpoon
ipa
long
trail
ipa
and
the
clear
lack
of
any
hop
presence
in
the
blind
faith
was
glaring
i
would
be
fine
with
it
if
it
was
presented
to
me
as
maybe
a
scottish
60
md
full
body
but
not
really
sticky
appropriate
easy
to
drink
low
abv
for
what
they
call
an
ipa
but
thats
not
so
bad
a
surprisingly
tasty
brew
from
magic
hat
who
i
generally
stay
away
from
good
but
better
in
memory
d
a
pretty
good
english
ipa
and
easy
to
have
a
few
as
the
5
9
abv
is
manageable
for
an
evening
i
could
stand
to
have
a
little
more
balance
and
toastier
english
malt
satisfaction
but
its
a
good
reprenstation
of
the
style
nonetheless
would
probably
be
good
with
some
bbq
or
memphis
dryrub
ribs
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
nice
beige
head
that
retains
pretty
good
the
aroma
has
some
minty
and
floral
hops
upfront
along
with
fruity
esters
minerals
biscuit
and
caramel
and
a
little
alcohol
the
flavor
has
some
fruit
upfront
green
apple
and
pear
along
with
some
earthy
and
floral
hops
esters
a
little
toffee
sweetness
some
biscuit
and
a
wallop
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
oily
side
and
drinkability
is
diminshed
by
the
alcohol
presence
a
decent
interpretation
of
an
english
ipa
but
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
strong
even
for
the
style
and
the
complexity
of
the
hop
profile
just
isnt
there
drinkability
i
could
relax
after
a
long
day
at
work
and
drink
a
few
of
these
with
no
problem
beer
poured
with
decent
amount
of
of
white
head
the
body
of
the
beer
was
hazy
and
slightly
darker
than
expected
smell
was
minimal
slight
hints
of
spicy
hops
and
of
malt
first
quaff
started
and
finished
nicely
bitter
with
malty
flavors
in
the
middle
the
after
taste
hinted
of
spice
and
pine
the
mouth
feel
was
good
but
not
great
i
enjoyed
blind
faith
and
was
surprised
by
the
complexity
of
this
english
style
ipa
drinkability
a
good
drinkabilty
i
can
picture
myself
sitting
down
and
drinking
a
couple
of
these
with
no
problem
bitter
finish
d
a
solid
ipa
one
that
might
appeal
to
a
large
crowd
still
not
an
ipa
i
would
prefer
over
other
stronger
offerings
i
must
admit
that
as
i
was
first
discovering
beer
around
my
21st
birthday
and
earlier
this
quickly
became
a
favorite
of
mine
a
staple
every
time
i
went
home
to
ct
i
was
pretty
bummed
out
when
they
retired
it
considering
how
instrumental
it
was
in
starting
this
whole
process
so
needless
to
say
mowing
through
this
6
pack
will
be
pretty
nostalgic
for
me
d
i
treated
this
six
pack
like
larsonstyle
treats
a
case
of
coors
lights
before
a
concert
at
the
meadows
very
glad
they
brought
this
one
back
d
one
of
the
better
offerings
ive
had
from
magic
hat
something
ill
probably
pick
up
more
of
if
i
can
find
it
in
a
sixer
like
ive
read
others
doing
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
glad
to
see
it
in
6
packs
again
instead
of
mixed
12
packs
cant
remember
exactly
the
last
time
i
had
it
but
i
was
hardly
as
into
beer
as
i
have
been
the
past
few
years
and
it
did
not
disappoint
from
my
memories
of
it
d
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
beer
magic
hat
has
a
reputation
for
putting
marketing
before
their
beer
im
now
not
sure
thats
the
case
this
beer
is
very
tasty
and
one
i
will
buy
more
of
for
sure
a
very
tasty
ne
ipa
cant
wait
to
see
what
the
other
rotating
ipas
are
like
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
drinking
it
has
some
kick
but
is
only
slight
with
a
decent
abv
that
will
makes
this
a
bit
strong
but
not
too
strong
a
good
beer
d
each
drink
leaves
you
wanting
more
d
a
nice
ipa
id
have
another
well
either
my
palate
as
greatly
changed
since
this
went
off
the
market
a
couple
years
ago
which
it
def
did
or
this
is
not
the
same
blind
faith
they
brought
us
before
maybe
theyre
hoping
we
will
believe
them
on
blind
faith
see
what
i
did
there
but
im
not
buying
it
even
the
abv
is
different
for
this
batch
pretty
bland
i
think
plus
it
had
almost
no
carbonation
whats
with
that
come
on
magic
hat
what
happened
to
you
guys
d
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
im
not
usealy
crazy
about
ipas
or
i
havent
realy
started
to
appreciate
them
but
blind
faith
is
good
start
for
me
drinkability
a
good
not
great
ipa
not
a
session
brew
but
i
would
easily
drink
more
than
one
overall
a
good
american
example
of
an
english
ipa
up
to
the
mouthfeel
way
too
much
carbonation
for
the
style
which
makes
the
beer
come
off
thin
i
would
likely
and
probably
will
pick
up
another
bottle
of
this
in
future
d
its
solid
for
a
12
pack
offering
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
a
six
pack
cant
believe
i
have
never
tried
this
one
before
this
is
a
great
new
england
ipa
nice
hop
profile
to
this
one
good
bitterness
to
it
solid
mouthfeel
and
body
i
like
it
a
lot
better
than
lucky
kat
wish
they
made
this
one
available
year
round
solid
beer
for
sure
great
drinkability
def
a
good
addition
to
the
season
12
pack
it
seems
this
beer
just
has
an
identity
problem
it
doesnt
know
if
it
wants
to
be
an
english
ipa
a
citrusy
west
coast
ipa
or
a
malty
east
coast
ipa
and
instead
just
hints
at
all
of
them
without
asserting
its
own
identity
slight
hop
bitterness
but
very
drinkable
and
tame
for
an
ipa
must
be
different
than
it
was
in
2002
a
good
balance
for
sure
which
is
nice
but
nothing
stellar
thin
mouthfeel
doesnt
help
elevate
this
as
it
couldve
been
id
be
happy
with
plenty
of
this
at
a
warm
spring
party
but
nothing
special
i
think
this
one
needs
some
chocolate
to
bring
out
some
nuances
dancing
about
on
my
tongue
drinkability
id
have
no
problem
having
a
few
of
these
during
a
nice
summer
evening
its
a
good
beer
for
sure
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
nothing
too
great
good
all
around
beer
if
a
friend
wanted
to
drink
an
ipa
and
wasnt
used
to
them
this
would
be
an
excellent
one
to
start
with
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
overly
exceptional
that
would
make
me
want
this
over
others
the
cactus
fruit
and
honey
suckle
provided
some
oddball
flavors
for
me
here
but
still
did
taste
good
feeldrink
great
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
is
just
right
pretty
drinkable
magic
hat
is
many
things
but
not
drinkable
isnt
one
of
them
d
pleasant
not
outstanding
d
good
balanced
ipa
good
flavors
and
feel
9282004
this
is
a
nice
all
around
beer
if
not
my
favorite
certainly
one
of
my
favorites
from
magic
hat
copper
color
topped
with
a
medium
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
maintains
a
nice
head
throughout
a
very
smooth
fruity
bitter
hoppy
flavor
the
malts
are
there
too
which
provide
a
nice
backing
and
add
balance
to
the
beer
i
liked
it
too
bad
its
now
retired
taste
is
fairly
herbal
from
the
hops
little
buttery
but
barely
noticeable
decent
citrus
presence
nothing
outstanding
or
noteworthy
from
this
magic
hat
offering
certainly
not
my
favorite
from
them
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
creamy
offwhite
head
which
leaves
some
nice
small
islands
and
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
more
on
the
malty
side
but
there
is
some
hoppiness
there
as
well
slight
citrus
and
pines
good
dose
of
caramel
the
taste
is
maltyhoppy
some
citrus
and
pines
going
on
and
some
caramel
thrown
in
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
and
bitter
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
english
ipa
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
out
overall
a
very
tatsy
and
well
balanced
ipa
rumor
has
it
that
this
beer
will
soon
be
made
no
more
that
is
too
bad
overall
a
solid
ipa
that
i
could
enjoy
over
and
over
again
i
was
dissapointed
with
blind
faith
this
time
around
it
was
lacking
the
strong
hop
character
that
i
once
remembered
nonetheless
i
could
still
drink
a
bunch
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
that
i
did
very
boring
pine
hop
profile
caramel
and
some
toffee
with
herbal
notes
thin
in
mouthfeel
yett
a
modest
finish
not
sure
how
much
better
if
at
all
this
would
have
been
if
served
fresh
i
miss
this
beer
i
think
this
one
may
be
bad
and
its
not
what
its
supposed
to
be
i
may
have
to
have
this
again
when
its
a
fresh
bottle
poors
an
orange
amber
with
a
frothy
head
that
goes
away
pretty
quick
smells
of
sweet

the
tatse
is
also
mostly
of
citrusy
hops
but
in
no
way
overpowering
much
more
ballanced
then
th
hipa
with
a
fair
amout
of

this
is
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
its
not

its

a

color
on

formed
an
offwhite
one

quickly
faded
into
a
thin
ring
of

aromas
of
sweet
malt
herbal
and
floral
hops
minor
citrus
notes
strong
malty
flavors
followed
by
a
strong
kick
of
hops
some
piney
flavors
present
was
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
mild
carbonation
no
noticeable
alcohol
the
severe
maltiness
throws
this
brew
slightly
out
of
balance
pretty
good
though
very
drinkable
this
is
a
mighty
tasty
ale
plain
and
simple
personally
i
would
have
classified
this
as
an
esb
but
no
matter
it
is
just
good
this
is
an
alright
brew
i
usually
am
not
big
on
drinking
beer
with
food
but
i
dont
think
i
would
have
this
any
other
way
nothing
outstanding
but
it
was
worth
trying
definitely
not
as
strong
and
full
of
character
as
others
of
the
style
served
in
a
pint
glass
on
draft
appearance
was
very
ambercoppery
but
clear
creamcolored
head
with
some
lacing
aroma
of
citrusy
american
hops
flavor
was
citrusy
spicy
hops
in
the
beginning
a
tangy
flavor
in
the
middle
and
a
dry
bitterness
in
the
end
some
caramellytoasted
maltiness
also
evident
the
tangy
flavor
in
the
middle
seemed
inappropriate
for
the
style
and
i
hope
it
isnt
the
result
of
a
dirty
tap
would
be
interested
to
know
if
anyone
else
detected
this
in
this
beer
if
not
id
imagine
it
was
an
issue
at
the
bar
this
beer
was
just
discontinued
by
magic
hat
after
12
years
in
the
brew
kettle
its
a
unique
beer
that
is
easy
to
love
and
will
be
missed
its
a
dry
beer
decent
thickness
medium
body
a
little
fizzy
very
drinkable
has
a
sweetness
that
makes

some
faint
buttery
diacetyl
flavor
is
better
nice

hops
with
an
adequte

and
nice

flavor
this
was
one
of
the
ipas
that
got
me
into
good
beer
along
with
harpoon
ipa
i
havent
had
it
in
a
long
time
i
would
buy
the
mix
packs
much
more
often
if
it
replaced
circus
boy
i
should
really
pick
up
a
six
pack
of
this
more
often
d
im
a
pretty
big
fan
of
most
magic
hat
beer
even
though
that
seems
fairly
lookeddownupon
in
some
circles
this
is
another
solid
beer
that
i
could
definitely
drink
all
night
from
the
bottle
this
poured
with
the
asexpected

with
a
thin

oddly
enough
the
hoppy

reminds
me
of
my

a
ladys

salon

no
it
didnt
turn
me
off

thankfully
the
flavors
stray
from

not
exactly
an

or
maybe
ive
been
sampling
too
many
dipa
of
late
regardless
i
went
through
the
other
bottles
rather
quickly
and
had
to
hold
onto
this
one
until
i
could
take
some
notes
a
very
sessionable
ipa
a
big
shout
out
to
beachbum
for
the
trade
this
beer
kicked
off
the
great
christmas
wrapping
project
06
which
went
well
sometimes
you
embark
on
such
things
with
a
bit
of
blind
faith
that
youll
be
done
before
santas
big

we
made
it
aaahhh
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
a
little
slick
and
quite
pleasant
all
added
up
to
excellent
drinkability
i
will
buy
again
as
that
was
the
last
of
that
sixer
and
i
want
more
d
very
drinkable

you
like

strong

presence
without
pushing

edge
pours
a
deep
golden
orange
with
a
frothy
white
head
a
very
potent
smell
with
a
heavy
hop
bouquet
with
hints
of
citrus
and
some
sweet
notes
the
taste
is
disappointing
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
smell
starts
hoppy
and
citrus
and
finishes
sweet
with
very
little
bitter
taste
this
is
a
different
brew
but
i
respect
their
venture
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
good
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinker
a
very
inoffensive
ipa
weak
in
flavor
but
a
good
balance
i
would
suggest
this
for
magic

lovers
or
those
who
are
afraid
of

the
review
definitely

the
buy
list
d
tasty
easytodrink
not
very
filling
even
though
i
prefer
the
american
style
ipa
over
the
english
style
this
beer
is
pretty
good
its
worth
staying
with
for
an
evening
especially
if
you
like
the
style
this
ipa
poured
a
cloudy
gold
with
some
head
and
lacing
a
sticky
piney
aroma
was
present
with
some
malted
notes
the
taste
was
not
what
i
expect
in
an
ipa
not
much
hop
characteristic
very
one
dimensional
in
flavor
and
too
sweet
the
roasted
caramel
malt
came
on
too
strong
on
the
back
end
there
was
that
signature
macrobrew
taste
as
well
not
too
heavy
medium
carbonation
fairly
drinkable
magic
hat
needs
another
shot
at
brewing
a
quality
ipa
d
i
could
drink
these
all
day
long
perfect
for
an
afternoon
by
the
pool
or
thanksgiving
dinner
beer
is
a
cloudy
orangehoney
color
without
much
visable
carbination
creamy
white
head
that
condenses
but
never
goes
away
first
smell
of
this
beer
is
very
dank
and
floral
for
ipa
lovers
this
smell
is
pretty
close
to
heaven
beer
has
almost
a
sweet
beginning
which
works
well
with
the
floral
aroma
citrus
notes
fill
your
palet
the
hop
bitterness
comes
through
at
end
of
the
beer
rounding
out
the
complete
hop
flavor
from
floral
to
bitter
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
for
an
ipa
with
appropriate
carbinaton
for
an
ipa
from
an
american
micro
this
is
actually
pretty
drinkable
as
it
is
well
balanced
and
not
overhopped
really
a
great
ipa
tasty
d
much
more
enjoyable
than
hipa
in
the
sense
that
the
flavors
form
a
great
balance
with
the
hops
theres
no
purehop
punch
not
that
lots
of
hops
are
a
bad
thing
definitely
keep
your
eye
out
for
this
one
nice
orange
color
with
a
white
head
and
lacing
smells
of
nice
hops
and
biscuit
malt
tastes
of
biscuit
and
caramel
malt
to
start
followed
by
strong
hops
hops
flavors
are
of
juicy
grapefuit
and
spice
with
other
flavors
i
cant
quite
describe
just
a
good
ipa
here
tasty
wellbalanced
and
very
drinkable
grab
a
sixer
some
time
its
a
decent
ipa
it
could
use
more
body
and
the
malt
is
belated
pretty
good
selection
of
hops
though
not
bad
d
easy
to
drink
but
definately
my
cup
of
tea
or
pint
of
beer
d
strongly
lacking
distinction
and
balance
probably
nothing
i
would
pick
up
again
without
a
recipe
change
d
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
it
doesnt
taste
that
good
really
it
is
a
quaffable
beer
but
it
lacks
any
meritous
characteristics
not
terrible
but
far
from
great
cheers
taste
is
dominated
by
hops
i
cant
determine
what
hops
but
they
are
certainly
spicy
and
very
hoppyresinous
and
give
the
beer
a
blackberry
aromatic
taste
is
this
brewers
gold
or
bullion
mouthfeel
is
dry
light
caramel
and
bitter
do
i
taste
liquorice
a
wonderfull
beer
which
is
surprisingly
in
balance
final
notes
i
actually
preferred
this
beer
more
as
it
warmed
in
my
opinion
it
became
a
little
bit
more
like
a
traditional
english
ipa
as
the
flavors
melded
together
and
sort
of
softened
the
hops
in
some
ways
i
think
it
feels
closer
to
an
american
pale
ale
particularly
when
its
cold
like
i
said
id
been
a
bit
down
on
magic
hat
lately
but
a
thoughtful
deliberate
drinking
of
the
blind
faith
surprised
me
and
reminded
me
why
i
liked
this
when
it
first
came
out
years
ago
a
clear
copper
brew
whose
head
subsides
to
leave
a
trim
white
ring
around
the
glass
the
blind
faith
doesnt
look
like
much
but
its
aroma
will
give
you
a
hint
of
whats
to
come
sweet
crisp
hoppy
with
the
occasional
whiff
of
a
supermarkets
produce
section
i
eagerly
took
a
sip
and
discovered
one
of
the
most
wellbalanced
ipas
ive
ever
encountered
a
subtle
aroma
of
mulched
leaves
highlights
the
blind
faith
lighter
on
the
bittering
hops
heavier
on
the
finishing
hops
this
ipa
is
supremely
drinkable
even
more
so
because
of
its
fine
carbonation
i
drank
mine
without
food
to
great
results
but
next
time
i
think
ill
have
it
with
a
meal
amberred
body
with
almost
no
head
other
than
a
light
tan
film
smells
overwealmingly
hoppy
tastes
bitter
with
some
alcohol
notes
not
sure
what
to
think
i
know
ipas
are
hoppy
but
this
ones
not
quite
as
wellbalanced
as
i
thought
kind
of
hits
you
over
the
head
with
hop
bitterness
perfect
for
hopheads
maybe
while
i
like
hops
im
not
really
one
nonetheless
a
fullflavored
medium
bodied
solid
beer
very
drinkable
easy
to
drink
and
flavorable
very
solid
offering
i
had
some
on
draft
in
the
past
and
if
i
remember
correctly
i
was
much
more
impressed
with
the
draft
especially
regarding
smell
d
pretty
good
i
expect
more
flavor
after
the
smell
but
it
still
has
a
pretty
good
taste
and
goes
down
easy
dvery
good
drinkability
very
drinkable
subtle
yet
not
underhanded
a
kind
of
muted
ale
that
chameleons
itself
to
whatever
you
happen
to
be
eatingdoing
my
deductions
for
taste
are
because
i
dont
think
this
would
be
as
good
as
it
is
in
the
summer
in
the
winter
but
right
now
pass
me
another
six
pours
a
golden
amber
fluffy
white
head
with
excellent
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
subtle
pine
hops
are
most
noticeable
body
is

carbonated

nicely
hopped
has
a
bit
of
a
carmel
apple
thing
in
the

did
not
knock
my
sox
off
but
worth
a
try
cheers
d
despite
having
a
strong
preference
for
american
style
ipas
i
find
this
one
quite
enjoyable
this
one
has
the
subtleties
of
an
english
but
with
just
abit
more
hops
than
most
i
would
be
very
happy
drinking
this
all
night
long
cheers
mouthfeel

the
beer
is

ipa
for

drinkability
i
like
this
a
lot
better
than
their
apa
not
that
it
means
a
whole
lot
i
guess
one
factor
that
keeps
it
drinkable
is
that
you
want
to
keep
drinking
so
you
dont
experience
the
funky
aftertaste
a
good
beer
but
i
was
hoping
to
taste
more
maltyness
for
greater
balance
overall
this
is
my
favorite
offering
from
magic
hat
an
excellent
sessionable
ipa
overall
a
decent
english
ipa
tasty
in
its
own
right
but
i
just
prefer
american
sort
of
reminds
me
of
harpoons
ipa
well
balanced
a
little
thin
but
definitely
a
session
ipa
that
i
would
enjoy
more
of
yumm
drinkability
took
a
bit
of
a
hit
here
as
i
just
dont
like
that
buttery
taste
in
my
beer
all
in
all
blind
faith
is
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
it
wont
sear
your
tastebuds
like
most
american
and

do

its

needed
an
extra
shot
of
hops
to
round
it
out
dry
and
citric
and
still
enjoyable
but
far
fro
my
favorite
ipa
approaches
balanced
for
an
ipa
and
seems
to
me
more
of
a
pale
ale
on
acid
as
an
ipa
should
be
most
ipas
are
absolutely
too
mild
in
malt
andor
too
much
in

it

with

taste
is
quite
similar
biscuit
rich

i
guess
the
odd
sourness
is
the
ringwood

strain
that
others
speak
about

a
strange
toasted
wood
aroma
that
i
can
only
assume
is
coming
from
the
ringwood
yeast
very
nice
taste
that
starts
off
with
some
creamy
maltiness
with
the
trademark
ringwood
flavors
before
it
transitions
to
a
strong
floral
citrus
hops
flavor
the
hops
are
left
sitting
on
the
tongue
and
create
a
nice
lingering
bitterness
the
brew
is
creamy
across

going
towards

at

i
would
like
it
to
e
a

this
just
hit

right
right

almost

why
too
hoppy
for

a
nice
easy

good
good
everyday
ipa
mild
enough
for
people
unused
to
ipas
but
flavorful
enough
to
enjoy
a
nice
maltier
ipa
very
different
a
mellow
ipa
with
floral
hints
pretty
good
beer
i
wouldnt
drink
back
to
back
but
i
would
order
time
to
time
had
this
on
tap
at
harpoon
larrys
in
newport
news
pours
a
fairly
clear
amber
with
a
small
whitish
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
a
very
faint
aroma
of
hops
and
a
fairly
watery
mouthfeel
dominate
the
beverage
it
does
have
a
nice
malty
floral
taste
to
it
overall
an
acceptable
ipa
beer
is
very
nice
smooth
pleasant
deep
amber
color
twofinger
head
of
tight
white
foam
thins
out
after
a
few
minutes
leaving
some
remnants
on
the
glass
the
beers
aroma
is
sweetreminiscent
of
honeysuckles
i
must
describe
the
taste
and
feel
as
insipid
but
only
because
of
my
high
esteem
for
some
of
this
brewers
other
products
a
good
drinkable
beer
but
not
an
eyebrow
raiser
good
reliable
ale
is
my
main
goto
had
this
out
of
the
bottle
i
remember
it
better
but
that
was
draft
at
the
brewery
i
absolutely
like
this
ipa
on
the
light
side
but
is
very
drinkable
and
perfect
out
of
a
kraft
well
done
copper
color
along
with
floral
hops
and
an
amazing
balance
of
hops
and
grains
with
the
full
body
make
this
a
very
good
ipa
well
balanced
malt
and
hops
really
drinkable
tasty
on
the
lighter
side
ipa
color
is
a
nice
shade
of
blonde
head
sticks
around
with
good
lacing
not
a
hop
bomb
but
enough
to
remind
you
its
an
ipa
in
addition
to
the
bitterness
a
decent
malt
backbone
not
chewy
but
a
good
tingle
on
the
tongue
from
the
carbonation
in
the
context
of
a
traditional
english
ipa
harpoon
nails
it
im
shocked
it
is
not
on
average
rated
much
higher
this
is
a
well
balanced
ipa
with
no
pronounced
malt
backbone
as
it
were
malts
floral
and
fruit
are
all
well
combined
with
what
might
possibly
be
one
of
the
best
east
coast
masterpiece
interpretations
of
the
style
other
than
the
abv
being
a
little
high
for
an
english
this
one
is
killer
very
good
ipa
i
really
like
the
hoppy
flavors
in
this
compared
to
others
good
feel
crisp
refreshing
and
lighter
than
some
of
the
more
heavy
duty
ipas
ive
had
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
have
again
good
taste
and
dont
normally
like
ipas
feel
slight
carbonation
could
be
more
one
of
the
best
ipas
ever
real
good
probably
my
favorite
apa
so
far
at
least
best
balanced
in
my
opinion
hops
to
malt
here
in
florida

is
often
on

at
publix
for

99
a
good
price
if
you
just
want
a
simple
6
pack
of
a
decent
ipa
this
is
a
really
good
session
ipa
looks
good
in
the
glass
mild
taste
but
well
made
good
beer
to
get
your
buddy
into
ipas
why
did
i
drink
this
i
dont
even
like
ipas
always
a
good
go
to
not
as
complex
as
i
like
but
nothing
wrong
at
all
and
a
good
flavor
best
example
of
an
eastcoast
ipa
understated
hops
taste
great
smooth
finish
disclaimer
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
ipa
but
my
curiosity
keeps
me
tasting
i
try
to
temper
my
preconceptions
when
evaluating
ehhhhh
top
notch
ipa
and
a
favorite
of
mine
good
beer
although
its
not
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
an
ipa
english
ipas
are
definitely
not
my
favorite
overall
full
hop
and
malt
flavors
well
balanced
throughout
nice
hoppy
nose
medium
bitter
finish
easily
on
par
with
odell
ipa
my
favorite
ipa
this
is
what
i
compare
all
of
my
other
ipa
tastings
to
perfect
hop
aroma
with
crisp
tangy
citrus
flavor
yummy
11
much
better
than
i
think
it
gets
credit
for
the
beer
pours
a
straw
colored
yellow
with
a
thin
head
that
trails
the
glass
a
lot
of
great
floral
smells
come
through
because
of
the
hops
the
taste
has
a
hop
punch
up
front
and
then
a
lot
of
great
toasted
flavors
coming
through
a
very
complex
yet
approachable
beer
would
definitely
recommend
for
an
everyday
beer
or
maybe
a
nice
beer
to
start
getting
into
ipas
with
decent
and
a
good
price
but
seems
to
be
dropping
in
quality
a
subtle
solid
ipa
when
i
lived
in
boston
this
was
my
goto
ipa
an
excellent
contrast
to
the
west
coast
superhop
approach
though
i
like
those
too
o
a
great
staple
from
the
east
coast
that
can
appeal
to
many
people
if
a
bar
had
this
on
tap
i
would
have
it
without
a
second
thought
one
of
my
favorite
eipas
reliable
and
by
the
book
assertive
american
ipa
meaning
a
good
solid
ipa
i
would
sure
drink
this
again
my
first
ipa
so
probably
more
of
a
sentimental
favorite
but
i
love
it
in
a
can
overall
a
staple
probably
one
of
the
beers
i
have
consumed
the
most
had
this
on
tap
at
the
burlington
maritime
festival
umphrees
mcgee
concert
served
in
a
12
oz
clear
plastic
cup
a
clear
copperyellow
with
a
thin
white
head
mostly
malt
in
the
nose
not
a
hop
bomb
at
all
taste
was
better
than
i
expected
after
the
lack
of
hop
aroma
caramel
malt
sweetness
with
a
slightly
bitter
backbone
although
lacking
significant
hop
flavor
nice
refreshing
beer
perfect
for
the
occasion
as
enjoyed
by
the
horde
i
am
an
ipa
whore
the
more
hops
that
drop
kick
my
tonsils
on
the
way
down
the
better
in
my
honest
opinion
this
should
be
an
all
day
ipa
it
goes
down
great
but
may
leave
you
wanting
more
by
no
means
is
it
tasteless
yellow
boiled
wheat
byproduct
but
drinks
more
like
a
pilsner
than
an
ipa
harpoon
makes
great
products
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
just
know
it
is
not
going
be
like
a
lot
if
the
ipas
on
the
shelf
nowadays
its
damn
good
on
any
occasion
great
with
any
meal
best
when
shared
with
friends
or
well
dont
be
a
dick
if
your
hosting
the
least
you
can
do
is
serve
beer
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
serve
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
standard
ipa
i
dont
want
to
describe
it
as
entry
level
but
its
a
solid
ipa
for
folks
who
dont
do
ipas
with
heavy
frequency
its
not
a
hop
bomb
or
an
especially
complex
beer
but
its
nice
for
what
it
is
o
not
as
exciting
as
some
of
the
new
kids
on
the
block
but
an
old
reliable
taste
is
a
light
start
with
pale
malt
and
citrus
hops
grapefruit
and
apricot
smooth
bodied
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lot
of
graininess
overall
a
decently
sessionable
ipa
a
bit
more
of
a
dry
floral
edge
to
it
with
a
crayon
type
of
character
coming
in
it
does
dry
out
and
linger
on
with
some
of
the
maltiness
has
some
earthy
and
dry
bitterness
getting
a
bit
more
balanced
by
the
malt
toward
the
finish
there
are
better
ipas
for
sure
but
this
one
seems
to
work
alright
a
bit
more
of
an
english
influence
to
it
is
quite
evident
but
the
combination
didnt
hit
it
out
of
the
park
overall
i
think
this
is
an
underrated
beer
from
harpoon
while
it
certainly
wont
knock
your
socks
off
this
is
a
solid
brew
with
a
good
balance
of
flavors
would
recommend
enjoyed
a
two
hearted
ale
bells
last
night
and
a
finestkind
smuttynose
ipa
the
night
before
that
so
this
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
its
still
a
nice
beer
and
probably
the
best
choice
i
could
have
made
at
the
supermarket
on
a
sunday
night
as
opposed
to
my
usual
place
to
score
beer
o
solid
ipa
on
the
lighter
side
o
really
like
the
balance
of
including
yeast
and
malts
as
well
as
the
hop
and
floral
taste
i
am
not
really
an
ipa
guy
and
i
get
more
pleasure
from
this
as
a
drinkable
beer
than
from
say
60
min
if
youre
crazy
about
hoppy
bitterness
you
will
find
this
too
sweet
o
a
reliable
and
pleasing
east
coast
ipa
i
do
tend
to
lean
towards
ipas
with
more
citrus
character
but
this
one
will
certainly
not
disappoint
not
overly
bitter
and
this
would
also
serve
as
a
nice
introduction
to
american
ipas
for
those
that
find
themselves
reluctant
to
give
them
a
try
bright
copper
gold
overall
it
is
quite
clear
after
the
pour
the
head
is
a
couple
of
fingers
tall
but
it
falls
quickly
and
to
a
thin
layer
of
fine
bubbles
that
lace
nicely
throughout
the
session
the
bottle
says
ipa
but
my
nose
doesnt
quite
agree
the
aroma
is
much
more
in
line
with
a
pale
ale
than
an
ipa
with
a
lot
of
caramel
and
a
bit
of
sweet
buttery
notes
and
very
little
in
the
way
of
hops
the
taste
too
is
ok
there
is
a
good
bit
of
bitterness
up
front
and
a
lot
of
sweet
caramel
but
really
not
much
in
the
way
of
hop
flavor
or
unique
malts
the
beer
finishes
with
a
bit
of
a
metallic
twang
that
im
not
too
sure
about
either
carbonation
is
relatively
high
and
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
bitterness
in
there
as
well
which
is
nice
and
overall
its
not
too
sweet
and
not
too
dry
overall
this
is
a
decent
sessionable
beer
an
ipa
for
people
who
dont
like
ipas
perhaps
poured
from
a
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
decent
head
smell
is
ok
nothing
special
taste
is
actually
pretty
good
refreshing
with
some
suttle
hints
of
citrus
nothing
spectacular
or
overwhelming
but
decently
balanced
and
enjoyable
feel
this
beer
is
slightly
underrated
and
find
it
to
be
a
little
above
average
for
the
ipas
i
like
will
try
again
ovearall
formidable
ipa
overall
a
solid
brew
this
is
a
great
beer
as
far
as
ipas
go
i
would
consider
it
right
in
front
of
the
middle
of
the
road
candidates
it
has
a
great
floral
nose
however
it
leaves
you
wanting
more
not
much
but
wanting
more
considering
all
the
ipas
that
are
out
there
that
really
deliver
a
hoppy
punch
harpoon
kind
of
drinks
more
like
a
lager
delicious
for
all
cuisine
and
all
seasons
i
rate
it
high
because
it
is
a
great
goto
if
your
local
store
lacks
selection
if
your
local
is
on
the
eastern
seaboard
of
course
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
overall
its
pretty
good
o
a
good
ipa
although
a
bit
onedimensional
poured
from
bottle
to
mug
it
was
a
pretty
golden
color
head
stuck
around
basically
til
the
last
drop
smell
was
decent
the
taste
was
a
typical
ipa
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
there
was
just
nothing
really
to
differentiate
it
from
others
the
price
is
pretty
good
compared
to
other
ipas
ive
had
that
tasted
relative
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
drank
but
i
did
enjoy
it
no
complaints
here
very
herbal
and
citrusy
aroma
its
mild
and
less
westcoast
in
style
but
i
actually
really
enjoy
just
taking
a
big
woody
herbalspice
whiff
of
this
one
but
the
taste
does
not
deliver
a
little
boozy
and
thin
not
a
terribly
pleasant
or
smooth
bitterness
overall
ill
take
it
if
given
no
other
ipa
options
as
it
is
solid
and
gets
the
job
done
but
it
does
leave
me
wanting
more
on
the
taste
side
of
things
o
i
love
it
if
you
havent
tried
one
and
live
in
ne
then
there
is
something
wrong
so
far
one
of
my
personal
favorites
great
job
harpoon
overall
not
my
favorite
harpoon
brew
but
a
very
drinkable
beer
light
band
refreshing
its
a
fairly
light
ipa
so
those
that
dont
like
the
bitterness
of
other
ipas
may
like
this
im
sure
ill
pick
up
again
overall
very
nice
ipa
with
a
great
balance
of
malt
and
hops
neither
of
which
is
over
stated
very
drinkable
oabove
average
ipa
very
clean
and
light
was
expecting
more
hops
an
ok
beer
had
on
tap
fine
taste
but
hard
for
me
to
rate
higher
with
so
many
great
ipas
should
be
b
priced
with
the
average
ipas
and
i
would
rate
higher
overall
for
those
of
you
who
do
not
like
the
stronger
tasting
ipas
this
might
be
your
ber
many
a
friend
of
mine
o
not
like
the
real
hoppy
ipas
i
do
so
this
would
be
a
high
recommendation
for
them
i
would
be
interested
in
their
feedback
enjoy
overall
not
the
greatest
or
most
impressive
ipa
ive
had
by
any
means
but
im
not
sorry
it
was
part
of
the
twelve
pack
i
bought
and
those
who
cant
handle
very
strong
better
ipas
will
appreciate
its
mild
flavor
overall
ive
had
other
harpoon
beers
and
feel
they
could
do
better
pours
a
clear
light
copper
with
a
half
finger
of
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
nose
is
only
mildly
hoppy
overall
the
flavor
profile
is
quite
light
as
well
the
finish
is
slightly
hoppy
but
i
have
had
topshelf
apas
that
are
hoppier
than
this
offering
md
unfortunately
its
pretty
thin
on
the
body
and
the
semispritzy
fizziness
comes
not
as
soft
and
natural
as
a
bottleconditioned
ale
but
perhaps
its
designed
as
such
light
to
be
quaffable
and
the
overall
mouthfeel
is
clean
enough
indeed
not
as
deep
and
complex
as
the
fd
snake
dog
ipa
tasted
alongside
but
overall
an
easydrinking
example
all
the
same
overallcomments
a
very
good
ipa
that
doesnt
wow
you
but
does
a
good
job
representing
the
style
solid
and
drinkable
classified
as
an
american
ipa

nice
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
spotty
head
that
sticks
in
spots
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
pine
bitterness
with
little
malt
present
the
taste
is
not
as
bitter
as
the
smell
with
slight
caramal
honey
pale
malt
that
leads
into
the
piney
flower
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
not
really
a
hoppy
tasteing
ipa
like
the
smell
would
make
you
think
i
do
like
this
very
good
owhat
a
great
drinking
ipa
for
a
session
easy
to
drink
with
a
tad
more
abv
than
most
of
the
lighter
ipas
so
i
guess
thats
why
i
like
it
so
much
i
only
tried
it
after
checking
this
site
and
decided
to
become
a
member
to
review
it
as
my
first
beer
because
of
other
peoples
reviews
i
highly
recommend
it
even
though
i
may
not
be
a
beer
expert
but
believe
that
i
have
had
my
share
to
be
a
source
of
information
o
a
standard
unmemorable
ipa
definitely
is
more
of
an
english
style
beer
poured
out
a
clear
amber
very
lightly
carbonated
the
head
barely
exists
and
quickly
disappears
zero
retention
on
its
way
down
the
glass
though
it
does
leave
a
hint
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
little
odd
a
little
musty
and
also
sweet
the
taste
has
some
slight
nondescript
hops
flavors
and
a
slight
lilt
of
malt
there
is
a
decent
weight
to
body
and
it
is
fairly
smooth
its
not
terrible
but
not
one
id
go
to
again
o
this
was
the
first
ipa
i
had
besides
dfhs
60
and
90
where
i
realized
hey
i
like
ipas
not
very
surprising
since
its
such
a
subtle
version
of
the
style
recommended
for
people
who
arent
that
into
hops
but
would
like
some
bitterness
in
their
beer
this
isnt
an
old
ipa
but
this
really
seemed
to
start
off
with
such
promise
this
is
a
letdown
unfortunately
for
me
o
definitely
not
my
favorite
ipa
but
not
bad
seems
like
this
is
the
only
ipa
on
tap
around
this
area
of
ma
i
would
say
that
this
beer
is
very
average
o
a
surprisingly
drinkable
ipa
the
hops
are
light
and
like
others
said
a
good
specimine
for
someone
being
introduced
to
ipas
o
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
great
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
id
recommend
it
as
an
excellent
introduction
to
the
ipa
style
as
it
has
what
it
takes
to
exemplify
satisfactorily
what
an
ipa
is
but
it
is
not
so
hoppybitter
as
to
be
unpleasant
to
the
inexperienced
ipa
drinker
o
i
like
this
beer
and
will
buy
singles
here
and
there
when
i
get
a
hankering
for
an
ipa
not
too
wild
and
a
crisp
and
tasty
beer
the
price
is
right
too
o
pretty
good
beer
drinks
much
more
like
an
english
ipa
than
an
american
ipa
but
enjoyable
and
above
average
o
good
ipa
when
fresh
and
you
get
the
blend
of
the
grapefruit
and
caramel
nice
balance
to
this
brew
a
good
wholesome
ipa
perhaps
a
very
good
choice
for
someone
who
wants
to
venture
into
the
world
of
ipas
overall
an
above
average
beer
but
an
average
ipa
aroma
is
slightly
fruity
and
floral
poured
clear
orangeyellow
with
a
thin
but
long
lasting
white
head
some
lacing
to
glass
taste
is
perfect
not
overwhelmed
by
the
hops
just
the
right
bite
in
the
aftertaste
i
p
a
s
are
not
usually
my
forte
but
i
will
have
more
of
this
there
was
an
extra
label
on
the
bottle
which
noted
this
ipa
has
been
produced
for
twenty
years
now
understandable
after
trying
it
ill
bet
if
i
had
this
a
little
fresher
it
might
have
been
even
better
as
it
is
a
nice
staple
beer
we
cant
get
this
out
where
i
live
but
if
we
could
i
would
be
taking
sixers
of
this
to
nonbeergeek
parties
o
good
but
doesnt
stand
out
above
many
other
ipas
im
surprised
i
havent
reviewed
this
beer
yet
ive
had
it
many
times
this
rating
reflects
the
brew
as
i
had
it
on
tap
at
daves
house

for
the
opportunity

the

is
almost
an
after
thought
feel
like
im
drinking
potpourri
tea
was
really
wanting
to
love
this
beer
having
lived
in
boston
and
love
the
town
i
guess
the
fact
that
i
had
this
immediately
following
sierra
nevadas
torpedo
extra
ipa
it
really
didnt
stand
a
chance
ill
look
at
this
again
when
theres
no
comparison
but
on
first
blush
this
is
about
as
generic
an
ipa
can
get
consider
the
comparison
the
beer
finishes
nicely
and
is
constant
from
start
to
finish
overall
this
one
is
not
bad
at
all
but
certainly
nothing
special
it
is
pretty
balanced
if
that
is
what
you
like
but
the
floral
character
is
not
for
me
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
in
the
end
its
a
bit
too
mellow
and
middle
of
the
road
for
me
a
nice
solid
easydrinking
ipa
i
could
drink
several
of
these
and
not
get
tired
sessionable
for
sure
a
great
allpurpose
beer
for
chicken
fish
and
indian
dishes
id
love
to
have
a
dish
with
mango
with
this
as
i
think
the
contrast
would
be
nice
unfortunately
my
brother
in
law
is
coming
into
town
so
i
should
probably
hide
the
rest
of
the
case
before
friday
will
be
visiting
harpoon
brewery
in
boston
soon
o
for
me
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
would
order
at
a
boston
sports
bar
when
there
are
few
better
alternatives
and
this
does
happen
o
nice
ipa
with
a
crisp
finish
refreshing
and
light
o
not
great
but
enough
flavor
tang
and
drinkability
to
make
me
go
back
to
it
toasted
malt
and
herbal
hop
bitterness
up
front
mix
of
fruit
and
caramel
malt
fill
in
slight
sweetness
hop
flavors
and
bitterness
pick
up
toward
the
finish
herbal
spicy
and
a
little
piny
drier
in
the
finish
but
with
plenty
of
lingering
maltiness
again
wellbalanced
but
hoppy
enough
to
merit
the
ipa
badge
moderate
body
with
a
prickly
feel
o
a
solid
ipa
more
traditional
english
style
than
true
american
not
bad
at
all
nice
drinking
enjoyable
beer
drink
this
was
pretty
good
it
was
new
and
an
english
ipa
something
different
and
flavorful
to
sip
on
at
that
airport
glad
i
could
check
this
off
my
wants
d
a
decent
brew
wouldnt
complain
about
revisiting
this
ipa
but
being
somewhat
of
a
hophead
i
kinda
wish
there
was
more
of
a
hop
presence
really
just
splitting
hairs
at
this
point
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
a
average
ipa
not
outstanding
but
not
bad
either
something
you
can
have
in
the
fridge
all
in
all
drinks
like
a
chain
restaraunt
ipa
solid
but
bland
overall
dont
know
if
the
bottle
that
i
had
was
a
little
flat
but
a
very
drinkable
beer
o
this
beer
is
a
great
easy
drinking
ipa
that
can
satisfy
a
hop
lover
and
also
introduce
a
newbie
to
the
ipa
style
it
is
good
any
time
of
year
and
with
just
about
any
food
try
and
enjoy
from
the
label
i
would
have
not
thought
to
try
it
but
i
do
know
most
ipas
are
good
however
this
one
has
a
perfect
balance
of
taste
smell
and
feel
i
will
surely
try
it
again
harpoon
ipa
35
overall
an
extremely
average
but
tasty
ipa
really
i
think
this
should
be
classified
as
an
apa
as
it
really
doesnt
quite
make
it
to
the
ipa
threshold
overall
i
got
to
go
with
3
5
its
better
than
i
expected
and
will
buy
again
maybe
ill
aquire
a
more
filling
taste
for
it
maybe
i
havent
paired
it
with
a
great
food
not
sure
but
it
is
a
good
beer
and
i
will
definitly
have
again
the
beer
pours
a
very
clean
golden
color
bordering
on
amber
and
displaying
light
pinkish
tints
the
beers
body
is
very
translucent
and
particle
free
but
the
head
is
tiny
and
nearly
nonexistent
which
is
too
bad
what
bubbles
do
appear
appear
to
from
a
small
scrimring
around
the
glass
and
are
an
eggshell
white
the
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
is
spotty
and
quite
slick
only
staying
briefly
before
they
return
to
the
beer
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
grassy
and
haylike
hops
with
a
good
sweet
and
slightly
stale
bread
malt
base
and
a
light
citrus
touch
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
bitter
with
a
great
malty
sweet
playing
alongside
of
it
but
never
fully
meshing
with
the
bitters
the
beer
begins
with
light
caramel
sweets
and
a
faint
bitter
bite
before
the
bitters
open
into
a
nice
little
punch
with
very
slight
citrus
grass
and
hay
notes
as
the
beer
rounds
out
the
bready
malts
build
in
the
mouth
to
play
alongside
the
bitters
and
in
the
finish
there
is
still
a
great
bitter
tingle
with
a
fading
sense
of
the
bready
sweet
malts
just
as
the
beer
drops
down
the
throat
there
is
very
quick
emanation
of
cereal
malts
which
quickly
returns
to
the
bready
sweet
aftertaste
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
thin
to
medium
in
body
with
a
little
tingle
of
fierceness
from
the
carbonation
and
a
big
bitter
bite
on
the
tongue
the
mouth
is
left
clean
but
for
some
slight
saliva
on
the
edges
of
the
mouth
and
a
bitter
tingle
in
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
solid
middle
of
the
road
ipa
it
has
a
little
more
of
a
bitter
bite
than
a
true
english
ipa
but
not
nearly
enough
pine
or
citrus
to
be
considered
an
american
ipa
i
think
this
is
a
terrific
introduction
to
the
world
of
hops
and
ipas
and
definitely
a
recommendation
for
anyone
trying
to
slowly
convert
someone
else
to
the
hops
the
malts
and
bitters
work
beautifully
sidebyside
but
never
quite
mesh
which
isnt
entirely
bad
a
great
intro
ipa
and
a
good
beer
that
can
be
found
outside
of
craft
beer
bars
o
this
is
my
go
to
beer
it
isnt
an
overpowering
ipa
with
flavor
or
abv
it
is
a
good
ipa
that
is
available
almost
anywhere
in
ma
and
on
tap
at
almost
every
bar
if
i
feel
like
having
an
ipa
i
can
always
grab
this
it
is
also
generally
cheap
at
bars
around
boston
if
you
are
on
a
budget
b
im
not
sure
how
fresh
this
is
but
pours
a
dark
yellow
without
any
real
orange
accents
smells
sweet
malt
and
grain
and
some
floral
notes
but
not
strongly
hopforward
for
an
ipa
tastes
sweet
and
bready
and
malty
and
a
bit
bitter
but
again
not
really
positioned
strongly
for
an
ipa
more
alelike
here
fouthfeel
is
strongly
fussy
effervescent
and
really
good
overall
a
just
good
ipa
would
like
to
try
one
fresh
out
of
production
for
comparison
o
an
average
to
below
average
ipa
was
hoping
for
more
since
it
is
in
about
every
store
these
days
d
this
was
better
than
i
was
expecting
especially
if
you
frame
it
as
a
transitional
ipa
between
english
and
american
traditions
still
the
bitterness
and
astringency
gets
a
bit
fatiguing
and
the
flavor
is
a
bit
dull
in
general
id
drink
it
again
if
i
was
really
desperate
like
i
was
last
wednesday
but
there
are
much
better
options
available
virtually
everywhere
in
chicago
o
not
a
hop
bomb
by
any
means
but
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
im
not
usually
big
on
less
hoppy
ipas
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
hop
lovers
avoid
this
brew
overall
not
a
particularly
strong
ipa
this
would
be
an
ideal
session
ipa
given
that
it
doesnt
have
a
particularly
high
abv
and
is
pretty
easy
to
knock
back
given
that
context
i
like
it
a
lot
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
red
yellow
a
little
cloudy
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
in
the
glass
nice
aroma
of
floral
and
citrus
hops
very
nice
combination
tastes
of
malt
with
piney
and
earthy
hops
nice
bite
beer
seems
a
tad
bit
fizzy
but
still
finishes
nice
overall
a
very
good
beer
o
overall
a
great
solid
beer
with
a
nice
drinkability
fairly
subtle
for
an
ipa
and
lacking
depth
and
hop
complexity
might
be
a
good
intro
to
ipas
but
i
would
consider
this
to
be
closer
to
a
pale
ale
o
a
good
middleoftheroad
ipa
that
has
a
distinct
floral
hoppiness
and
a
good
malt
backing
nothing
too
special
but
certainly
a
good
sessionable
ipa
given
the
abv
a
good
intro
to
the
style
a
nice
drinkable
medium
bodied
ipa
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
aipa
poured
a
light
copper
color
very
clear
produced
a
very
nice
white
head
great
retention
and
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
of
this
ale
contained
malted
grain
and
an
explosion
of
citric
hops
very
nice
medium
in
body
this
aipa
had
a
foundation
of
malted
grain
bitter
citric
hops
crisp
refreshing
beer
excellent
session
beer
first
beer
that
i
have
tried
from
harpoon
impressed
if
you
want
a
good
starter
ipa
to
get
used
to
a
bit
of
bitterness
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
go
with
unfortunately
for
me
i
probably
would
never
buy
this
again
there
are
plenty
of
better
ipas
out
there
for
the
price
o
good
middle
of
the
road
ipa
not
to
much
of
anything
hops
the
beer
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
film
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
but
not
outstanding
hops
are
have
a
floral
aroma
not
sure
what
kind
of
hops
are
used
but
the
aroma
does
not
seem
to
match
the
taste
the
beer
has
a
fruity
sweetness
bitter
yes
but
not
overly
bitter
and
certainly
not
raspy
like
some
of
the
continental
hops
the
combination
is
unique
flavor
is
soft
and
pillowy
compared
to
a
lot
of
american
ipas
i
like
it
but
it
is
certainly
not
typical
this
makes
the
second
ipa
this
week
i
have
tried
with
unconventional
tastearoma
the
other
was
great
divide
the
beer
is
immensely
drinkable
accessible
for
those
just
getting
to
know
ipas
but
different
enough
to
be
interesting
to
the
initiated
the
texture
is
medium
lower
carbonation
keeps
it
soft
in
the
mouth
as
well
this
is
a
nice
offering
it
pours
a
beautiful
crystal
clear
gold
with
a
3
finger
head
leaving
elaborate
lacing
the
smell
is
bread
and
grass
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
not
thick
not
thin
but
pretty
average
taste
is
some
grapefruit
and
malts
with
a
nice
understated
hoppy
finish
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ipa
that
with
would
be
ideal
as
a
session
beer
i
understand
that
using
modern
2012
standards
to
judge
this
beer
apparently
introduced
in
1992
isnt
entirely
fair
the
hoppiness
of
ipas
has
increased
quite
substantially
as
a
result
this
is
basically
an
apa
im
trying
to
adjust
my
score
accordingly
regardless
its
certainly
not
bad
in
any
way
and
is
very
drinkable
if
it
deserves
any
bonus
points
it
should
get
some
for
being
a
gateway
beer
to
ipas
in
general
its
mild
enough
that
it
may
inspire
some
to
further
explore
the
style
a
few
years
ago
this
beer
actually
helped
me
on
my
path
to
finding
better
ipas
this
is
a
very
good
session
beer
bold
taste
just
make
sure
it
is
dated
within
the
month
of
purchase
poor
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
little
force
to
release
aroma
and
carbonation
i
would
not
consider
it
a
ipa
because
i
dont
get
the
bite
i
would
expect
but
not
disappointing
overall
while
not
really
all
that
appealing
from
the
smell
or
the
initial
tastes
the
beer
does
finish
well
its
ok
but
not
all
that
great
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
golden
with
a
large
white
head
plenty
of
bubbles
can
be
seen
streaming
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
head
dissipates
slowly
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
hop
aroma
is
more
of
the
citrus
variety
with
some
sweet
and
biscuit
malt
coming
through
in
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
follows
the
nose
the
hops
bring
the
citrus
flavors
ahead
of
the
biscuit
malt
backbone
there
is
some
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
the
body
is
light
with
abundant
carbonation
the
finish
is
dry
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
very
good
and
refreshing
ipa
the
whole
is
better
than
the
parts
decent
cheaper
option

o
enjoyable
and
goes
down
easy
but
nothing
really
stands
out
here
overall
just
average
for
the
style
might
be
a
good
place
to
start
if
your
new
to
hoppy
beers
though
m
light
body
with
some
creaminess
moderate
carbonation
taste
is
of
citrus
and
pine
as
well
light
at
first
and
then
building
toward
the
end
grapefruit
astringency
also
present
drops
quicklynot
much
aftertaste
mouth
feel
is
good
and
solid
pretty
easy
drinking
i
had
this
beer
for
the
first
time
and
when
i
tasted
it
i
had
to
check
the
label
to
make
sure
i
had
the
beer
i
wanted
nothing
about
this
beer
tastes
like
an
ipa
in
fact
it
tastes
like
a
lager
i
dont
know
if
they
got
their
labels
mixed
up
or
if
the
ipa
is
just
horrible
but
something
isnt
right
had
a
harpoon
ipa
on
draft
at
red
robbin
last
night
and
i
couldnt
even
tell
it
was
an
ipa
or
even
a
pale
ale
there
was
no
hop
aroma
and
barely
any
taste
it
was
a
bit
cloudy
also
it
reminded
me
of
bud
american
ale
which
has
no
noticeable
hop
aroma
either
i
dont
recommend
it
a
great
ipa
enjoyed
in
a
can
for
the
first
time
today
pours
crystal
clear
light
brassy
color
almost
glowing
in
the
sun
with
a
bigger
than
one
inch
off
white
head
smells
like
floral
hops
and
english
bready
malts
balanced
but
hop
forward
flavor
matches
this
is
the
classic
summer
ipa
to
me
its
got
just
enough
body
to
be
an
ipa
but
its
down
easy
with
a
drinkable
but
flavorful
malt
support
cast
the
hops
are
bitter
but
not
challengingly
so
just
sort
of
crisp
in
the
finish
also
this
is
very
well
carbonated
lovely
in
the
mouth
overall
one
of
my
go
to
summer
ipas
so
much
flavor
in
a
drinkable
body
this
is
everywhere
for
a
reason
poured
into
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
glass
full
inch
of
offwhite
head
that
never
completely
disappeared
throughout
session
copper
golden
color
that
is
completely
and
intensely
clear
nose
offers
bready
malts
and
faint
hop
aroma
taste
is
malt
and
hop
balance
perfected
which
is
not
exactly
preferred
in
the
american
ipa
style
so
im
not
taking
issue
with
the
beer
just
the
genre
that
its
listed
under
here
according
to
bas
definition
of
an
american
ipa
the
brewery
brochure
simply
says
its
an
ipa
so
this
may
be
more
accurate
flavor
is
certainly
floral
some
definite
cascade
hoppiness
and
finishes
with
an
unexpected
sweetmalty
appearance
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
perhaps
mead
which
would
go
along
with
the
floral
nature
to
the
beer
mouthfeel
again
is
lighter
than
one
would
expect
from
an
ipa
if
it
were
styled
as
a
pale
ale
i
may
have
given
it
a
perfect
rating
across
the
board
all
this
being
said
i
more
than
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
so
much
so
that
i
could
drink
it
all
day
long
beer
substitute
for
water
thank
you
very
much
harpoon
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
its
nowhere
near
my
favorite
ipa
i
just
wish
the
harpoon
ipa
had
a
bigger
hop
taste
and
smell
i
live
in
massachusetts
so
this
beer
is
very
easy
for
me
to
find
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
everyone
from
new
england
hasshould
have
tried
at
some
point
in
their
craft
beer
journey
o
nothing
stands
out
about
the
taste
of
this
beer
compared
to
other
india
pale
ales
but
it
is
a
very
easytodrink
beer
nice
and
reliable
ipa
although
not
distinctive
in
the
flavor
profile
originally
reviewed
02182011
o
great
intro
for
the
style
not
overwhelming
decently
sessionable
and
very
refreshing
and
balanced
however
those
looking
for
a
hop
bomb
will
be
left
dissapointed
still
a
solid
beer
and
a
great
alternative
at
a
bar
when
options
arent
very
good
overall
this
is
an
ok
ipa
not
my
first
choice
to
have
but
i
will
not
turn
one
away
o
im
a
fan
i
really
like
the
floral
flavor
and
the
aroma
is
very
pleasing
to
the
nostrils
when
in
that
ipa
mood
the
mouth
feel
is
pleasantly
dry
like
a
pale
ale
should
be
and
it
accomplishes
all
this
without
killing
your
palate
for
the
night
as
far
as
east
coast
american
ipas
go
i
really
like
this
one
wonderfully
mellow
without
being
boring
or
bland
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
and
good
retention
decent
lacing
as
well
aroma
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
with
a
bit
of
caramel
malts
in
the
back
citrus
hops
up
front
slightly
juicy
astringent
tartness
followed
by
rough
wheat
and
corn
husks
medium
bodied
pretty
average
ipa
but
drinkability
is
ok
o
nice
but
a
little
more
hops
would
make
it
better
overall
i
thought
that
was
an
ok
beer
and
a
slightly
above
average
example
of
an
american
ipa
if
the
flavor
was
as
nice
as
the
aroma
was
then
this
beer
would
be
able
to
hold
its
own
against
some
of
the
better
american
ipas
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
went
down
smooth
wasnt
filling
and
it
wasnt
too
bitter
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
few
of
these
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
was
pretty
good
and
fragrant
there
were
a
lot
of
things
going
on
and
it
turned
out
to
smell
pretty
weed
like
which
wasnt
a
bad
thing
with
this
beer
and
was
actually
one
of
the
highlights
what
i
like
least
about
this
beer
was
the
lack
of
hops
in
the
flavor
more
hop
flavors
and
more
bitterness
would
be
much
more
appealing
but
it
feels
like
this
was
much
hopier
at
one
point
and
it
tasted
like
the
hops
have
faded
so
this
beer
might
be
old
but
with
no
bottling
date
i
cant
be
sure
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
if
i
can
find
a
fresh
bottle
i
think
harpoon
is
available
in
michigan
but
i
have
only
seen
it
once
and
it
was
their
winter
warmer
and
i
havent
seen
anything
else
from
harpoon
since
i
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
shot
if
you
are
an
american
ipa
fan
this
beer
was
much
better
then
their
winter
warmer
and
im
sure
if
it
was
fresh
it
would
be
even
better
but
as
it
stands
out
now
its
pretty
close
to
being
an
average
american
ipa
if
it
wasnt
for
the
aroma
it
would
be
below
average
this
wasnt
a
really
impressive
ipa
but
it
wasnt
bad
by
any
means
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
and
i
would
like
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
to
get
a
better
feel
for
them
because
as
it
stands
now
i
am
not
that
interested
in
them
overall
drinkability
plenty
drinkable
went
well
with
the
deepdish
pizza
in
the
end
though
nothing
special
perhaps
an
average
example
of
an
aipa
good
simplicity
in
the
flavor
but
a
letdown
in
aroma
so
not
an
outstanding
aipa
overall
a
nice
clean
standard
ipa
so
my
initial
disappointment
is
pocketed
in
that
backstory
if
you
take
away
any
expectations
it
is
a
decent
beer
its
well
balanced
and
can
be
used
to
introduce
newcomers
to
the
idea
of
an
ipa
as
it
is
not
overwhelming
and
is
fairly
smoothe
to
drink
if
you
are
familiar
with
the
microbrew
communityare
looking
for
a
strong
american
ipa
though
this
isnt
going
to
be
what
youre
looking
for
approach
it
with
an
open
mind
and
remove
labels
such
as
style
and
you
might
enjoy
it
speaking
of
florid
deep
golden
color
with
a
medium
thick
white
head
that
lasts
a
good
amount
of
time
and
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
slightly
sweet
hoppy
aroma
with
lemony
accents
and
a
good
maltiness
sweet
hoppy
flavor
with
a
good
malty
background
light
to
medium
bodied
and
slightly
dry
when
i
first
started
drinking
i
thought
this
was
over
the
top
bitter
now
it
borders
and
pale
on
my
palate
i
dont
drink
it
as
much
but
i
respect
it
as
a
transition
beer
from
megaswill
30
racks
to
craft
beer
and
flavor
always
pleased
to
see
harpoon
as
the
flavorful
option
at
a
bar
with
a
otherwise
atrocious
lineup
o
a
solid
ipa
for
any
season
i
didnt
find
it
all
that
exciting
but
i
would
easily
go
back
to
this

no

its
a

especially
for
the

however
id
say
its
more
of
a
starter
ipa
it
is
palatable
to
those
sensitive
to
much
more
invasive
hop
flavors
a
light
to
medium
bodied
brew
with
medium
carbonation
this
a
fine
session
ipa
but
not
anything
to
ring
home
about
there
are
better
ones
pours

hazy
yellow
with
small
white
head
aroma
of
grass
and
hay
some
sweet
malt
with
not
a
lot
of
aromatics
for
the
style
this
one
had
some
weird
flavors
going
on
a
little
bready
malt
mixed
with
some
unwelcome
spice
the
hops
were
not
up
front
and
the
sweetness
was
not
balanced
with
bitter
not
impressed
despite
leviathan
being
a
great
ipa
i
am
hoping
i
just
grabbed
an
older
bottle
but
when
i
originally
had
this
i
didnt
pay
much
attention
to
those
sorts
of
things
overall
this
a
good
well
balanced
ipa
very
drinkable
i
would
probably
call
this
just
a
pale
ale
but
hey
i
didnt
brew
it
for
a
pale
it
it
is
pretty
darn
tasty
for
an
ipa
it
is
still
tasty
but
missing
out
on
the
strong
hop
points
overall
an
awesome
ipa
one
that
im
definitely
going
to
be
grabbing
way
more
often
very
floral
which
i
love
o
a
very
good
ipa
that
gets
overlooked
because
of
its
availability
i
still
like
to
revisit
this
beer
as
it
was
my
first
ipa
even
though
ive
had
many
more
that
i
would
deem
better
this
is
a
great
gateway
beer
o
still
new
to
the
ipa
hoppy
styles
and
this
has
been
a
nice
gateway
a
good
pick
all
around
o
solid
ale
very
balanced
and
well
hopped
o
this
is
an
good
ipa
its
very
drinkable
but
seems
to
lack
enough
spicy
hop
kick
in
the
smell
and
taste
department
however
because
of
this
you
could
easily
drink
a
few
definition
of
an
average
ipa
its
quite
drinkable
but
the
flavor
is
just
ho

is

not
hard

handle

the
mouthfeel
is
crisp

clean

where
you
can

disappointing
as
an
ipa
the
hops
are
not
very
wellserved
overemphasized
sweetness
and
grains
thus
not
as
hoppy
as
it
should
be
and
at
only
5
9
abv
its
a
rather
weak
one
a
good
beer
for
sure
but
its
lacking
as
far
as
ipas
are
concerned
its
up
there
as
one
of
my
go
to
ipas
especially
cool
that
it
comes
in
a
can
for
festivals
and
concerts
o
not
groundbreaking
but
its
enjoyable
and
nicely
balanced
qualities
i
look
for
in
an
ipa
great
introduction
to
the
style
i
find
there
is
no
after
taste
which
makes
this
ipa
particularly
clean
and
fresh
o
pretty
good
american
ipa
maltier
than
most
aipas
but
hey
id
come
back
to
it
this
is
my
favorite
beer
i
could
drink
it
everyday
if
it
werent
for
becoming
an
alcoholic
i
love
local
beer
and
this
is
the
best
in
the
boston
area
deep
malty
color
medium
body
great
hoppy
taste
this
is
my
ipa
standard
and
furthermore
standard
beer
long
live
harpoon
ipa
o
pretty
fair
beer
there
are
much
better
ipas
out
there
but
this
ones
not
bad
would
have
again
skal
overall
harpoon
ipa
is
a
solid
ipa
that
doesnt
overpower
you
with
bitterness
the
ipa
is
worth
ago
if
you
enjoy
the
style
overall
this
is
a
great
ipa
to
enjoy
on
a
summers
day
poolside
overall
a
nice
clean
simple
ipa
o
well
i
thought
for
sure
that
this
would
better
represent
as
it
seems
to
have
been
around
forever
i
am
however
disappointed
overall
the
weakest
ipa
ive
ever
had
in
terms
of
hop
presence
can
think
of
countless
other
ipas
that
are
6
abv
that
provide
a
better
experience
related
to
this
style
shouldnt
have
bought
a
sixer
oh
well
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
hue
with
a
small
off
white
head
with
nice
lacing
earthy
piney
hops
some
spicy
grapefruit
hit
the
senses
followed
by
some
nice
malt
and
yeast
taste
of
earthy
piney
hops
some
nice
citrusy
grapefruit
notes
and
some
nice
malt
and
yeast
palate
is
a
nice
medium
to
full
body
and
good
carbonation
finishes
with
an
earthy
piney
hoppiness
some
spicy
grapefruit
tones
balanced
by
some
nice
biscuit
caramel
malt
some
yeast
and
a
bit
of
a
nutty
flavor
overall
a
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
ipa
86
o
this
was
a
huge
let
down
then
again
i
dont
know
what
more
i
was
expecting
but
they
could
have
added
more
flavor
to
this
than
they
did
it
was
just
hanging
there
without
anything
giving
it
life
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
brew
the
sweeter
taste
than
many
ipas
means
that
this
may
be
something
to
turn
to
if
youre
looking
for
a
nice
easydrinking
sessionable
ipa
sadly
with
so
many
ipas
out
there
harpoon
ipa
may
fall
to
the
wayside
good
stuff
just
nothing
about
it
really
screams
unique
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
about
2a
fingers
of
head
that
retains
pretty
well
lots
of
citric
hops
on
the
nose
some
critic
and
biscuits
sweetness
up
front
but
it
finishes
with
a
citric
bouquet
of
hops
that
rounds
it
out
nicely
decent
carbonation
and
light
to
medium
in
body
decent
ipa
but
nothing
really
stands
out
about
could
make
a
good
session
ipa
if
the
hop
bitterness
didnt
build
so
quickly
and
in
a
bad
way
pours
a
pretty
crystal
clear
copper
orange
with
a
half
inch
finger
head
that
thins
to
a
slimy
lace
fruity
hop
characteristics
on
the
nose
met
with
sweet
bready
malts
nice
peach
or
orange
picked
up
in
the
hops
and
light
and
subtle
alcohol
like
sugar
on
the
end
bitter
hops
flood
the
tongue
but
do
not
over
take
it
the
mellow
malt
smooths
it
out
on
the
end
leaves
a
slightly
bitter
finish
lightmedium
on
the
body
creamy
and
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
beer
is
a
nice
and
easy
session
ipa
it
doesnt
have
a
dominate
hop
presence
and
thats
what
does
it
in
for
me
i
need
more
hop
out
of
my
ipa
than
what
this
gives
me
considering
that
back
to
the
drawing
board
overall
this
is
a
decent
ipa
good
malt
backbone
very
nice
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
the
only
down
side
are
the
hops
just
too
bitter
and
not
enough
citrus
or
aroma
overall
nothing
special
going
on
here
a
non
offensive
ipa
thats
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
at
home
on
a
hot
day
d
drinks
like
a
lightly
hopped
fruit
punch
however
this
aipa
is
certainly
lacking
a
punch
in
the
craft
beer
world
where
there
is
an
abundance
of
tasty
hoppy
pales
this
is
a
pass
overall
this
was
a
bit
different
than
expected
and
thus
its
ranking
could
be
affected
i
was
a
bit
let
down
but
its
still
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
overall
a
solid
beer
that
is
certainly
drinkable
and
refreshing
not
going
to
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
but
i
am
definitely
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
o
to
me
this
is
an
above
average
beer
and
just
an
average
ipa
nothing
is
bad
about
the
beer
however
the
flavors
and
aroma
are
a
little
tame
and
light
definitely
a
sessionable
ipa
poured
ontap
at
a
tgifridays
and
served
in
a
weissevase
the
beer
is
a
bright
coppergold
coloring
with
a
chestnut
color
in
the
depths
very
thin
film
of
white
head
atop
the
brew
light
and
green
nose
with
spicy
notes
throughout
and
an
overall
blend
of
grapefruit
and
oregano
the
flavor
is
caramel
malt
forward
with
a
roasted
character
followed
by
grapefruit
sweet
and
tart
and
then
ending
with
a
flush
of
fresh
green
wet
hops
at
the
end
and
pepperyallspice
highlights
throughout
grapefruit
sweet
and
tart
aftertaste
with
hops
spice
and
bitters
the
finish
is
quick
clean
and
dry
tasty
overall
a
good
beer
though
its
a
little
one
dimensional
its
not
the
best
ipa
on
the
market
but
its
one
of
my
gotos
when
im
in
a
pinch
this
was
a
pretty
straightforward
ipa
but
it
was
done
well
good
for
when
in
the
mood
for
an
ipa
but
it
isnt
a
real
blow
away
one
overall
not
a
great
beer
but
not
too
shabby
either
this
beer
has
a
good
scent
and
color
but
the
taste
is
a
little
to
bitter
and
the
feel
is
a
major
let
down
overall
not
too
shabby
an
ipa
its
betterbalanced
than
most
and
is
more
sessionable
but
it
lacks
that
special
something
to
really
put
it
over
the
top
definitely
worth
a
try
and
something
ill
probably
come
back
to
in
the
future
overall
this
was
a
good
ipa
and
will
be
glad
to
have
anotherone
at
a
later
date
clear
medium
gold
color
moderate
white
head
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
behind
thick
sheets
of
lacing
aroma
is
subdued
but
grassy
with
pale
malts
providing
for
a
mellow
background
flavor
is
fairly
hoppy
with
grass
and
herbs
as
the
main
component
also
found
a
bit
of
drying
wheat
and
some
cheap
tasting
pale
malts
medium
body
easy
to
drink
but
a
bit
unsettling
at
the
same
time
average
ipa
at
best
a
medium
bodied
affair
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
for
some
reason
maybe
if
there
were
stronger
and
richer
hops
tastes
there
would
be
a
different
reason
for
wanting
more
o
it
doesnt
resemble
an
ipa
at
all
potentially
a
pale
ale
not
my
favourite
harpoon
offering
i
would
not
recommend
but
i
might
grab
one
more
to
see
if
its
better
than
this
one
d
this
is
a
great
eastcoast
standby
i
dont
appreciate
the
last
several
b
and
c
grades
some
of
the
other
members
have
given
harpoon
ipa
the
previous
beer
drinkers
claim
that
this
beer
appears
to
be
toomacro
for
cryin
out
loud
this
is
one
of
the
1st
post
bass
ipas
thats
been
around
forever
mid
to
early
90s
paved
the
way
for
what
everyone
tastes
now
was
a
fan
in
the
back
in
the
day
and
remain
one
d
super
drinkalbe
for
an
ipa
d
not
my
fave
ipa
but
i
would
put
a
few
away
quickly
the
aftertaste
is
consistent
with
the
taste
good
hop
but
when
that
adjunct
malt
flavor
comes
around
it
tends
to
stick
around
thats
on
the
exam
this
is
on
of
the
lightest
tasting
ipas
ive
had
well
balanced
and
good
flavor
the
flavor
does
well
to
mask
the
abv
depressing
head
formation
with
a
clear
light
amber
hue
of
a
body
lightly
piney
citrus
nose
carried
by
more
of
a
grain
scent
the
taste
is
balanced
but
weak
the
light
hop
bitterness
coats
the
tongue
as
the
malt
washes
over
hardly
leaving
a
trace
or
influence
maybe
ive
been
spoiled
but
i
expect
a
bit
more
out
of
my
ipas
at
least
the
leviathan
is
incredible
pours
a
pretty
light
copper
color
with
a
thin
head
and
no
lace
smell
is
nice
fruity
hops
melon
pineapple
maybe
a
little
weak
but
good
taste
is
far
drier
than
the
nose
would
imply
thin
piney
hops
without
a
lot
of
malt
backbone
medium
to
low
carbonation
and
thin
mouthfeel
not
bad
but
not
something
ill
go
out
of
my
way
for
overall
a
pretty
decent
ipa
not
one
of
my
faces
but
i
would
drink
it
again
this
is
an
excellent
ipa
for
a
restaurant
franchise
to
offer
because
its
nothing
too
overpowering
and
has
good
drinkability
i
probably
could
have
paired
it
with
any
of
their
menu
items
i
happened
to
have
a
cheeseburger
with
french
onion
soup
this
beer
offers
such
a
neutral
palate
it
could
probably
go
with
just
about
any
cuisine
o
nothing
offensive
about
it
just
a
bit
boring
seemed
lacking
in
oomph
just
needs
a
little
something
more
to
get
it
to
solid
not
a
bad
option
in
the
greater
boston
area
though
where
it
may
be
the
best
draft
beer
available
the
cpj
o
for
an
ipa
this
one
is
suprisingly
lightbodied
and
not
very
memorable
goes
down
easy
but
then
again
so
do
the
less
expensive
budlights
of
this
world
overall
an
ok
ipa
one
of
the
more
boring
ones
ive
had
not
likely
to
ever
buy
again
overall
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
brew
it
could
have
been
a
bit
more
fresh
but
the
beer
is
still
pretty
damn
good
o
not
what
im
looking
for
in
an
ipa
i
like
a
balanced
ipa
and
this
one
is
very
balanced
but
it
doesnt
have
enough
oomph
in
it
especially
on
the
hop
end
had
this
on
tap
at
this
evenings
summer
brewfest
in
norfolk
va
pours
a
nice
golden
copper
color
with
a
good
finger
and
a
half
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
smell
was
of
spicy
hops
and
citrus
grapefruit
and
orange
came
to
mind
taste
followed
smell
but
hops
were
a
bit
subdued
it
was
a
balanced
flavor
though
and
rather
easy
drinking
for
its
abv
overall
this
is
a
good
ipa
offering
but
there
are
better
fresh
sixer
in
boston
ma
poured
into
a
glass
and
a
was
wonderful
golden
and
very
clean
this
was
highlight
of
the
brew
despite
my
nostalgia
around
it
s
was
weak
malty
flavor
with
light
hops
t
left
much
to
be
desired
as
it
was
certainly
a
pale
ale
to
me
not
an
ipa
bummer
m
was
okay
but
nothing
special
and
o
it
was
disappointing
light
flavorless
ipa
with
a
nice
color
as
its
best
asset
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
frequently
pick
it
as
my
favorite
ipa
that
is
widely
avaialable
im
my
experience
this
brew
is
much
better
on
tap
than
it
is
out
of
the
bottle
i
have
not
yet
had
it
out
of
a
can
but
i
look
forward
to
trying
that
as
well
o
this
is
the
beer
that
got
me
into
hops
so
it
will
always
have
a
special
place
with
me
but
not
quite
up
to
my
standards
now
not
saying
this
is
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
many
more
ipas
out
there
far
better
than
this
one
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
considering
the
price
this
beer
is
constantly
stocked
in
my
fridge
o
an
average
ipa
not
a
standout
but
solid
id
have
another
overall
i
was
always
aware
of
harpoon
from
a
young
age
and
after
reading
reviews
about
this
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
much
what
i
got
however
was
a
very
nice
middle
of
the
road
ipa
that
makes
a
perfect
goto
beer
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
ipa
that
got
me
through
the
day
the
friends
of
mine
who
did
try
it
all
enjoyed
it
a
lot
i
would
think
this
could
be
a
very
good
low
abv
ipa
to
bring
to
a
summer
bbq
or
gathering
to
introduce
some
noncrafat
beer
drinkers
to
craft
beers
would
certainly
have
it
again
o
great
ipa
a
regular
to
drink
though
not
super
hoppy
and
somewhat
low
alcohol
level
the
beer
is
crystal
clear
and
light
yellow
hued
effervescence
lasts
the
duration
of
the
session
the
head
is
a
finger
thick
and
leaves
some
decent
legs
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
pretty
weak
with
only
faint
traces
of
hops
the
flavor
is
better
with
some
pine
and
hop
flavors
and
a
lingering
bitterness
overall
an
ok
offering
do
with
all
the
other
good
to
great
ipas
out
there
dont
waste
your
time
with
this
one
must
be
eight
dollar
beer
night
o
totally
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
its
not
hyped
but
harpoon
makes
decent
stuff
but
this
just
sucked
i
wanted
to
go
with
below
average
but
i
give
this
beer
points
for
being
a
bit
different
o
went
well
with
all
the
dishes
served
ranging
from
indian
and
texmex
appetizers
to
deepdish
supreme
pizza
to
flatbread
pizza
enjoyable
on
its
own
as
well
im
not
a
big
fan
of
any
ipa
that
is
below
6
but
i
thought
i
would
go
ahead
and
rate
anyway
well
balanced
ipa
in
the
english
style
with
a
decent
malt
background
and
a
burst
of
american
cascade
hops
reasonable
color
and
aroma
not
the
typical
hop
bomb
ipa
but
enough
hops
to
still
be
a
reasonable
example
of
the
style
for
a
pale
ale
again
i
dont
think
you
can
have
an
ipa
below
6
it
should
just
be
called
a
pale
overall
decent
offering
a
little
lacking
on
the
bitterness
side
considering
its
an
ipa
but
smooth
and
refreshing
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
in
a
session
i
would
try
and
buy
this
again
the
tasting
wasnt
very
balanced
there
is
a
lot
of
bitterness
overwhelming
almost
everything
else
in
the
beer
i
picked
up
some
citrus
but
it
wasnt
a
good
mix
of
flavors
overall
a
sessionable
ipa
worthy
of
a
try
but
not
among
the
best
out
there
o
i
found
it
to
be
good
ipa
and
a
bit
better
on
tap
than
out
of
the
bottle
might
not
meet
some
peoples
hop
desires
but
i
liked
the
flavors
and
balance
another
thursday
another
tasting
at
bliss
this
offering
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
a
finger
or
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
flowers
light
grapefruit
orange
zest
and
very
light
lemon
zest
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
mild
contingent
of
caramel
in
the
background
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
or
light
medium
whichever
yall
prefer
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nearly
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
nice
ipa
nothing
outstanding
but
something
easily
drinkable
o
this
is
a
much
more
subdued
taste
that
i
was
expecting
from
an
ipa
was
sweeter
then
most
and
not
quite
as
crisp
not
bad
but
not
great
either
it
is
very
drinkable
as
always
its
worth
a
try
and
i
would
certainly
do
that
but
there
are
better
out
there
o
congrats
harpoon
ipa
if
you
cant
be
the
best
why
not
be
the
worst
good
feel
the
body
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
solid
overal
this
has
been
a
go
to
beer
for
me
for
quite
some
time
glad
to
see
this
solid
offering
in
cans
these
days
v
at
the
price
i
paid
not
a
great
value
so
it
loses
half
a
point
there
are
better
ipas
for
less
money
received
this
in
my
bierkraft
order
of
a
mixed
case
i
had
tried
before
but
not
reviewed
it
pours
a
nice
coppery
colour
into
my
chalice
smell
immediately
hits
me
from
the
opening
and
probably
the
most
appealing
attribute
steady
flow
of
carbonation
and
some
gentle
lacing
upon
dissapation
of
most
of
the
head
smell
is
citrusy
maybe
apricot
and
grapefruit
pineconish
taste
ranges
in
the
same
area
of
smell
with
some
mild
maltiness
only
drawback
is
that
it
overall
seems
subdued
like
a
hopaliscious
beer
trapped
in
the
body
of
a
light
beer
other
than
the
watered
down
appearancetaste
overall
it
is
a
satisfying
beer
i
could
certainly
recommend
this
for
a
springtime
session
on
the
beach
cheers
o
great
aroma
and
good
flavor
score
would
be
higher
if
this
was
classified
as
a
pale
ale
or
had
more
hops
o
a
refreshing
ipa
thrashing
was
easy
to
drink
after
bowling
soiree
good
friend
brought
a
couple
of
bottles
of
harpoon
ipa
so
i
had
to
try
it
the
color
was
clear
and
golden
and
had
decent
white
head
and
laced
quite
well
the
nose
had
a
good
hints
of
citrus
hops
and
subtle
floral
undertones
the
taste
was
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
pinecitrus
mouthfeel
was
good
this
is
a
good
session
ipa
serving
type
bottle
o
drinkable
and
easy
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
nothing
outstanding
about
it
either
overall
a
very
nice
ipa
indeed
could
become
a
staple
beer
for
those
that
want
a
lot
of
flavor
but
dont
like
some
of
the
other
hyperhopped
up
ipas
out
there
poured
a
slightly
hazy
amber
with
some
carbonation
and
a
humble
white
head
faint
aroma
of
citrus
hops
and
caramel
malts
pretty
smooth
tasting
at
first
with
malts
and
nuts
up
front
and
hops
coming
in
soon
afterward
with
some
bitterness
citrus
and
pine
notes
lightmedium
mouthfeel
with
some
stale
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
fairly
drinkable
mouthfeel
was
adequate
and
over
all
i
would
say
this
is
a
decent
ipa
but
i
have
so
many
more
i
would
buy
first
average
at
best
d
an
average
beer
even
given
the
potential
style
miscategorization
its
an
easy
drinker
at
its
low
abv
but
there
werent
any
standouts
here
for
me
overall
a
tasty
good
and
drinkable
ipa
o
a
solid
low
gravity
american
ipa
definitely
one
of
the
prototypical
east
coast
ipas
its
balanced
but
still
has
an
assertive
hop
presence
o
nice
drinkable
ipa
not
really
standing
out
but
worth
a
try
onot
much
to
offend
any
one
bland
for
an
ipa
however
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
someone
to
the
style
d
very
drinkable
the
beer
has
a
pretty
good
malt
hop
balance
but
just
not
enough
of
either
especially
hops
the
aroma
and
the
taste
were
both
a
bit
too
subtle
and
needed
some
more
kick
still
a
really
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
overall
not
a
tremendous
beer
but
a
light
ipa
in
my
mind
very
easy
drinking
and
nice
to
get
back
in
the
saddle
without
spinrsx
i
would
have
never
made
it
this
far
i
rated
4
5
overall
because
despite
the
lack
of
distinctive
taste
this
ipa
still
holds
true
to
the
name
even
if
it
is
a
bit
gentle
if
youre
already
a
hophead
avoid
this
brew
as
it
will
be
far
too
light
but
if
youre
trying
to
get
your
friends
to
become
hopheads
or
you
want
a
sessionable
ipa
this
will
certainly
fill
that
niche

this
is

by

very

in
all
aspects
i
would
be
more
than
happy
to
drink
this
if
it
was
available
worth
a
try
for
sure
well
balanced
in
all

very
easy
to
drink
t
served
from

into
a
shaker
poured
golden
yelloworange
with
a
three
finger
bone
white
head
that
subside
to
one
finger
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
pine
pine
resin
and
pine
hops
the
flaovr
was
of
sweet
malt
pine
hop
and
pine
resin
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
i
was
not
a
massive
fan
of
this
one
if
you
like
pine
this
is
the
beer
for
you
it
was
even
more
piney
than
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
which
i
couldnt
believe
not
balance
in
the
flavor
at
all
just
pine
pine
pine
the
aroma
was
the
best
part
about
this
one
but
thats
not
saying
much
did
i
mention
pine
the
mouthfeel
is
delicate
just
like
the
brew
that
said
id
like
a
bit
more
thickness
the
drinkability
is
very
good
this
glass
didnt
last
long
in
front
of
me
at
all
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
ipa
i
like
the
fact
where
it
was
hopforward
without
punching
me
in
the
face
with
hops
just
a
very
well
made
and
drinkable
beer
with
just
enough
of
a
hoppy
bite
to
satisfy
me
not
the
extreme
punch
you
in
the
face
with
hops
that
many
people
expect
from
ipas
but
its
just
a
delicious
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
with
a
nice
ambergolden
color
and
a
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
little
lacing
smell
is
floral
with
a
hint
of
citrus
taste
is
more
of
the
floral
notes
balance
is
nice
feel
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
oily
finish
overall
a
good
beer
and
a
tasty
ipa
a
very
good
beer
to
introduce
people
to
a
true
ipa
quaffable
o
this
is
a
good
ipa
not
great
good
i
would
expect
it
to
have
a
bit
more
alcohol
to
keep
up
with
the
current
crop
of
ipas
on
the
market
this
a
session
ipa
its
light
in
the
body
so
its
easy
to
go
down
a
nice
taste
makes
this
a
ipa
to
try
drinkabilty
its
easy
to
drink
but
the
flavor
of
this
doesnt
do
much
for
me
so
much
better
ipas
out
there
this
one
needs
some
work
espcially
with
the
hops
easy
to
drink
and
low
in
alcohol
gives
it
some
points
other
then
that
nothing
special
here
more
of
a
pale
ale
then
ipa
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
just
needs
more
flavor
and
profile
not
a
world
class
beer
but
one
that
would
be
good
after
mowing
the
grass
atmosphere
is
good
nice
look
good
head
and
some
decent
lacing
nose
is
a
really
good
combination
of
hops
citrus
sweet
and
spice
flavor
is
pungent
and
hoppy
with
a
citrus
and
sweet
tastes
like
it
smells
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
i
will
say
this
one
served
its
purpose
though
as
i
and
the
rest
of
the
wifeys
birthday
bunch
left
well
got
asked
to
leave
rather
toasty
on
tap
into
a
pint
glass
initially
served
a
bit
too
cold
and
needed
a
chance
to
warm
up
a
bit
poured
a
lighter
golden
color
than
i
expected
for
an
ipa
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
not
a
lot
going
on
in
the
nose
little
caramel
and
roastiness
not
a
lot
of
the
typical
hop
aromas
flavor
was
good
but
light
on
the
hops
for
an
ipa
mostly
caramel
and
roasted
malt
with
slight
fruit
notes
hops
are
really
only
present
in
a
slightly
bitter
dry
finish
smooth
and
drinkable
pretty
good
beer
i
just
didnt
think
it
was
a
great
fit
for
the
style
reminded
me
more
of
a
slightly
more
bitter
red
ale
or
the
like
than
true
ipa
this
was
my
first
time
with
this
beer
on
draft
and
i
must
say
that
i
enjoyed
it
much
more
than
the
few
times
that
ive
had
it
out
of
the
bottle
lots
of
fresh
bright
citrus
flavors
and
bitterness
here
which
were
well
balanced
and
the
creamy
body
here
kept
this
very
drinkable
this
has
a
bit
of
an
americanized
british
ipa
hybrid
thing
going
on
and
i
really
liked
it
pours

citrusy
doesnt
punch
you
in
the
face
whops
malt
crystal
caramel
flavors
delicately
hopped
by
todays
standards
this
one
is
a
weak
ipa
because
of
the
lack
of
hop
character
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
slightly
bitter
by
todays
ipa
standards
nicely
drinkable
o
although
no
maltiness
detected
sweetness
in
the
nose
and
mouth
balances
the
finishing
bitterness
nice
overall
a
good
ipa
that
is
balanced
but
lacking
in
the
hop
aroma
and
flavor
for
me
not
bad
by
any
stretch
but
also
not
that
exciting
i
wont
remember
this
one
tomorrow
avail
here
in
tx
rotation
good
but
too
many
other
better
ones
out
there
to
buy
again
unless
once
on
tap
no
medium
body
lighter
carbonation
fairly
soft
on
the
palate
drinks
quietly
and
quickly
as
the
flavor
is
forgettable
along
with
nearly
everything
else
about
this
beer
this
is
probably
one
of
the
more
boring
ipas
ive
ever
had
drinks
fairly
decent
would
go
down
easy
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
this
bottle
came
in
a
variety
pack
but
if
offered
i
would
drink
it
maybe
a
fresher
bottle
would
be
better
drinkability
is
very
good

of
malt
flavor

d
unoffensive

that
could
be
plowed

cheers
d
very
drinkable
or
more
like
sippable
this
is
a
solid
beer
with
no
shortage
of
the
good
stuff
you
want
in
an
american
ipa
id
buy
it
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
an
ipa
and
there
wasnt
another
one
available
that
i
havent
tried
or
have
and
liked
better
usually
on
top
over
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
golden
straw
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
that
makes
nice
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
of
floral
hopsand
a
hint
of
bread
and
maybe
a
note
of
sweet
peaches
flavor
is
piny
faintly
citrus
over
a
light
toasted
and
biscuity
malt
taste
the
palate
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
and
a
hopy
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
a
very
sessionable
and
enjoyable
beer
id
love
to
try
this
beer
fresh
not
avail
out
here
so
had
to
go
with
what
i
could
get
seems
like
it
has
the
bones
of
a
good
beer
d
not
the
greatest
ipa
but
a
nice
one
that
is
readily
available
all
over
boston
where
i
bought
this
good
for
watching
the
hockey
game
but
not
something
i
would
session
or
look
for
again
worth
a
try
though
i
was
more
excited
about
trying
this
beer
than
i
was
pleased
with
the
beer
poured
yellow
with
a
little
head
that
receded
quickly
it
smelt
like
it
was
going
to
deliver
in
the
bitterness
department
but
all
around
was
a
very
mild
beer
perhaps
a
beginners
ipa
in
thats
its
easy
to
drink
and
gives
you
a
small
idea
what
to
expect
from
an
ipa
fourthbeer
potential
average
nothing
particularly
exciting
in
this
beer
when
compared
to
ipas
but
it
is
certainly
drinkable
havent
found
an
ipa
that
ive
ever
liked
guess
i
still
havent
cant
see
what
all
the
hype
is
about
sorry
pours
a
pale
gold
color
quick
rush
of
thin
soapy
head
gone
quickly
scent
is
pale
light
wheat
malt
with
faint
touch
of
stale
grassy
hops
and
even
fainter
touch
of
lemon
orange
and
pine
taste
is
as
disappointing
as
scent
pale
all
around
no
malt
backbone
and
no
hop
bite
faint
flavors
of
pale
malt
and
grassy
hops
some
mustiness
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
disappointment
if
bmc
light
was
dry
hopped
with
year
old
hops
this
would
be
it
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
is
dark
in
its
taste
but
still
good
the
smell
is
the
best
ive
smelled
in
a
while
the
taste
is
fairly
strong
with
a
surprisingly
sweet
aftertaste
it
is
sweet
but
still
heavy
pretty
good
but
not
goo
on
drinking
many
at
a
time
solid
d
pretty
good
i
would
have
a
couple
of
these
no
problem
solid
job
by
harpoon
d
really
forgettable
ipa
balance
yet
nothing
really
stands
out
in
being
sweet
or
hoppy
it
just
exists
the
first
word
that
comes
to
mind
when
i
think
of
this
beer
is
plain
not
bad
but
not
too
special
this
is
a
middle
of
the
road
ipaeasy
to
drink
but
just
not
that
great
very
drinkable
although
boredom
might
set
in
this
was
a
very
good
ipa
the
flavor
was
good
and
perfectly
balanced
this
might
be
the
easiest
drinking
ipa
ive
had
beer
is
medium
to
thin
in
body
and
tastes
like
sulfur
with
some
moderate
bitterness
on
the
backend
the
overall
feel
of
hte
beer
is
ok
the
drinkability
is
fine
but
this
is
clearly
a
bargain
basement
crappy
ipa
for
the
masses
from
mass
i
am
unimpressed
and
will
continue
to
overlook
this
particular
ipa
where
is
the
ipa
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
the
best
ipa
i
have
ever
had
by
far
but
very
good
a
nice
summer
beer
great
for
any
hophead
this
is
another
one
of
my
goto
brews
its
sometimes
hard
to
get
but
is
often
available
in
my
area
it
is
a
good
session
beer
for
me
as
the
abv
is
not
too
high
and
it
goes
well
with
most
food
i
havent
seen
it
outside
of
my
area
on
recent
vacations
i
do
check
around
to
see
whats
available
so
i
guess
im
lucky
that
i
can
usually
get
this
topshelf
selection
d
would
drink
all
night
long
drinkability
crirsper
than
what
i
would
normally
order
or
expect
from
an
ipa
but
pleasantly
bitter
not
sure
if
this
would
have
more
character
out
of
a
bottle
rjt
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ipa
but
pretty
tame
by
todays
standards
a
lot
of
people
think
they
have
dumbed
down
this
recipe
but
if
the
brewery
is
telling
the
truth
then
this
is
the
exact
same
recipe
and
all
that
has
changed
is
peoples
perceptions
due
to
the
other
extremely
hopped
ipas
on
the
market
whatever
the
case
may
be
this
beer
is
still
quite
tasty
but
it
is
no
longer
a
go
to
d
the
standard
of
ipas
nothing
out
of
this
world
but
a
great
refreshing
goto
beer
this
is
a
great
standard
ipa
it
embodies
everything
about
the
name
that
it
should
it
is
fairly
average
but
the
perfect
example
of
what
the
standard
should
be
it
pours
golden
with
a
small
head
into
a
pint
glass
smells
hoppy
and
fruity
with
some
very
subtle
malt
notes
its
flavor
is
quite
nice
and
is
a
very
refreshing
brew
good
mouthfeel
and
decent
drinability
d
very
drinkable
sessionable
ipa
its
not
weak
but
smooth
and
wellbalanced
hop
and
malt
bill
would
have
liked
to
sample
fresher
ill
have
to
revisit
a
good
lookinggood
smelling
great
tasting
beer
that
is
reasonable
in
price
and
very
available
in
our
area
it
is
nothing
super
special
but
i
never
seem
to
pass
one
up
i
have
had
many
folks
who
claim
to
not
like
ipa
enjoy
this
beer
i
think
that
is
because
of
the
balance
hopsmalt
alcohol
for
taste
the
usual
hops
malt
citrus
were
there
just
a
tad
like
very
slighty
on
the
plain
side
could
have
had
more
bitterness
to
it
but
overall
easy
drinking
and
a
good
ipa
definitely
enjoyed
it
overall
a
very
pleasant
beer
it
wont
change
your
world
but
it
is
a
solid
contribution
nose
is
rather
underwhelming
in
the
hops
department
smells
of
sweet
floral
and
apple
a
dash
of
lemon
that
seems
somehow
artificial
tastes
disappointing
as
well
plenty
of
bready
malt
general
fruity
sweetness
a
bit
of
lemonymedicinal
something
that
could
be
construed
as
hoppiness
old

possible
im
inclined
to
think
not
given
the
turnover
of
the
store
in
question
what
im
not
inclined
to
do
is
to
try
this
again
in
summation
everything
about
this
beer
feels
weak
for
the
style
the
abv
of
only
5
9
the
lack
of
good
hop
bitterness
throughout
and
even
the
appearance
is
a
bit
drab
by
comparison
to
some
of
the
other
top
contenders
its
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
very
impressive
one
if
im
going
for
an
ipa
id
much
rather
have
a
dogfish
head
or
preferably
stone
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
would
be
perfect
for
lounging
by
the
pool
it
seems
a
little
watered
down
but
still
good
drink
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
to
me
tasted
a
little
bit
like
a
pilsner
im
not
sure
id
seek
it
out
again
but
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
drinkability
with
a
good
taste
and
mouthfeel
ill
have
another
had
on
tap
at
papa
razzi
restaurant
in
boston
with
dinner
showed
up
a
clear
orange
with
a
thin
head
in
a
pint
glass
pretty
calm
looking
in
the
glass
but
the
lacing
practically
coats
the
side
as
i
drank
the
brew
nice
piny
citrusy
hops
smell
doesnt
seem
oveewhelming
in
the
hops
just
how
i
like
it
taste
however
is
much
more
bitter
than
the
nose
lends
overall
nice
ipa
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
pretty
medium
bodied
and
an
easy
drinker
could
be
balanced
a
bit
more
for
my
tastes
but
a
standard
ipa
if
you
like
ipas
and
havent
tried
this
one
its
most
definitely
characteristic
of
the
style
good
interpretation
by
harpoon
my
first
run
in
with
this
brewery
d
meh
this
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
college
but
i
guess
ive
grown
out
of
it
its
not
that
its
a
horrible
beer
its
fairly
drinkable
but
its
a
horrible
ipa
if
you
go
in
with
the
expectation
of
an
american
ipa
or
any
other
type
you
may
be
sorely
disappointed
d
i
find
this
beer
to
be
extremely
drinkable
light
but
not
certainly
not
dull
this
citrusy
ipa
could
fight
warm
summer
nights
overall
this
is
not
a
hard
ipa
to
drink
the
bitterness
does
not
over
power
and
makes
for
a
relatively
easy
to
drink
beer
not
worth
revisiting
or
reordering
with
the
plentiful
amount
of
great
offering
available
today
on
tap
at
the
bar

served

a

some
good

the
way
down
the
taste
is
malty
with
some
pine
and
floral
hops
seeking
to
balance
the
flavor
is
mostly
malt
with
a
bit
of
bread
and
some
light
floral
hops
a
bit
of
bitterness
and
a
good
body
drinks
well
enough
but
not
too
fantastic
serviceable
enough
as
a
session
beer
but
certainly
not
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
ipa
d
just
not
very
enjoyable
a
chore
to
drink
when
compared
to
the
lagunitas
ipa
i
just
had
pretty
disappointing
drinkability
fairly
standard
good
choice
to
a
beer
to
go
with
for
the
evening
especially
at
bars
close
to
bc
that
have
limited
selections
d
its
just
ok
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
completely
i
feel
like
the
flavor
combinations
dont
blend
together
for
for
my
enjoyabilitydrinkability
pairs
very
well
with
my
spicy
indian
dumplings
with
spinach
and
flat
bread
more
indian
restaurants
need
to
sell
ipas
this
stuff
is
very
drinkable
need
to
keep
some
of
this
around
yearound
i
could
serve
this
to
almost
anyone
and
they
would
find
it
a
good
choice
d
there
isnt
much
flavor
but
at
least
there
arent
any
off
flavors
again
a
little
sweet
but
a
fine
light
hopiness
that
drives
the
drinkability
clear
yellow
color
with
thin
white
head
slight
piney
smell
with
a
hint
of
hops
this
beer
does
not
really
taste
like
an
ipa
the
hop
flavor
is
very
weak
with
little
bitterness
tastes
more
like
an
pale
ale
not
a
bad
flavor
just
not
an
ipa
drinks
very
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
overall
a
good
beer
just
not
worthy
of
a
high
ipa
grade
about
halfway
through
the
beer
i
had
a
bowl
of
curry
pork
and
the
beer
went
really
well
with
that
d
very
enjoyable
a
good
ipa
that
is
not
overhopped
or
overhyped
check
it
out
overall
i
seem
to
have
at
least
on
harpoon
ipa
a
month
living
in
boston
it
can
often
be
the
best
beer
in
the
room
at
a
party
or
nonbeer
specialty
bar
however
this
is
not
one
to
try
if
you
are
at
a
place
with
other
regional
or
national
ipas
on
hand
d
not
my
new
favorite
ipa
but
its
not
terrible
either
a
good
place
to
start
and
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
day
still
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
harpoon
is
always
solid
da
really
meh
beer
for
me
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
good
all
around
but
really
nothing
special
for
me
at
least
d
see
above
very
clean
flavors
very
easy
drinking
for
a
beer
or
two
it
wont
kill
you
d
very
drinkable
decent
ipa
if
youve
got
nothing
else
value
pretty
good
i
paid
7
49
for
a
sixer
drinkability
an
excellent
ipa
very
well
balanced
and
priced
easy
to
come
by
and
easier
to
drink
i
like
this
on
a
number
of
levels
first
the
smell
is
not
overpowering
some
ipas
are
a
bit
strong
in
the
nose
and
this
is
unoffensive
the
taste
is
good
if
not
a
bit
overly
carbonated
and
this
might
contribute
to
its
very
drinkable
nature
this
is
a
good
warmup
for
those
uninitiated
in
the
more
robust
ipas
think
dogfish
head
all
in
all
very
enjoyable
by
the
way
took
a
while
to
find
it
among
all
the
harpoons
listed
in
the
beer
advocate
reviews
does
this
brewery
really
make
a
bazillion
kinds
of
beer
guess
so
drives
home
the
fact
this
really
isnt
a
microbrew
brand
even
though
its
relatively
young
overall
this
ipa
was
fairly
forgettable
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
id
be
in
a
rush
to
revisit
pours
transparent
golden
with
large
white
head
on
top
aroma
of
grains
some
light
malt
subtle
lemon
grass
and
spice
tastes
of
slight
spice
sweet
malt
aggressive
grassy
and
citrus
hops
bitter
towards
the
finish
with
a
slight
buttery
characteristic
light
crisp
upfront
carbonation
and
a
damn
good
ipa
a
summer
session
with
great
flavor
light
copper
color
with
perfect
clarity
very
thin
head
that
didnt
last
a
quick
swirl
of
the
glass
rejuvenated
the
white
cap
light
floral
aroma
with
a
hint
of
biscuit
light
hoppy
flavor
in
the
beginning
lemon
and
orange
that
rolls
into
light
malty
biscuity
taste
and
a
very
clean
almost
dry
finish
pretty
light
for
an
ipa
the
biscuity
flavors
and
finish
were
more
reminiscent
of
an
english
pale
ale
very
easy
to
drink
besides
the
abv
and
aroma
this
was
a
very
pleasant
beer
i
liked
the
rich
color
as
well
as
the
smooth
semidry
body
and
nice
drinkability
i
could
put
away
a
couple
of
these
no
problem
and
i
did
wish
there
was
a
little
more
hop
flavor
than
what
was
present
theres
other
east
coast
ipas
out
there
that
id
probably
go
for
over
this
in
the
future
but
this
was
definitely
worth
the
try
and
would
be
a
decent
fall
back
beer
overall
middle
of
the
road
ipa
many
out
there
that
are
far
better
but
a
refreshing
beer
for
the
style
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
had
high
expectations
a
unique
beer
with
a
unique
name
unfortunately
it
was
too
bitter
for
my
liking
probably
the
most
bitter
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
it
was
not
watery
at
all
but
if
you
are
a
big
fan
of
bitterness
then
you
should
like
this
beer
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
the
trade
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
dominated
by
hops
taste
is
also
very
hoppy
not
much
else
going
on
considerable
bitterness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkabilty
overall
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
more
similar
to
an
english
ipa
than
its
american
counterpart
very
smooth
well
balanced
flavor
with
decent
amount
of
nutty
maltiness
that
is
cut
short
from
the
mild
hop
back
would
view
this
beer
as
a
good
example
of
a
session
beer
not
my
favorite
beer
by
any
means
ive
had
apas
that
id
say
are
stronger
than
this
but
as
a
person
who
does
not
identify
as
a
hophead
the
english
yeasty
presence
defines
this
beer
much
more
so
than
the
hops
thats
not
a
good
thing
for
an
ipa
to
hand
its
hat
on
trying
this
next
to
a
stone
ipa
was
a
real
eye
opener
sometimes
beer
reviews
are
best
done
in

with
another
beer
of
the
same
style

demonstrating
that
the
rain
today
is
finally
killing
the
oppressive
head
and
humidity
of
the
past
week
as
the
head
slowly
reduced
d
a
low
abv
makes
this
easy
to
drink
although
the
hop
flavoring
is
not
as
potent
as
expected
pours
a
really
clear
copper
color
with
a
1
finger
head
and
some
lacing
but
wow
this
was
the
clearest
ipa
ive
ever
seen
the
smell
was
some
floral
citrus
hops
and
some
toffee
notes
maybe
burnt
caramel
the
taste
was
the
same
it
was
a
mild
taste
in
hops
but
at
the
same
time
it
had
an
odd
burnt
toffee
taste
followed
by
sweet
malts
mouth
feel
was
medium
but
not
full
flavored
or
balanced
that
well
this
is
not
a
great
ipa
imo
not
balanced
not
flavorful
light
to
medium
body
nice
resinous
hop
bitterness
balanced
with
good
sweetness
overall
a
solid
ipa
thats
well
balanced
if
a
bit
low
on
hop
aroma
or
flavor
clear
brassy
yellow
with
a
fine
eggshell
cap
that
leaves
a
little
fine
lace
on
the
glass
pale
malt
and
citric
cascade
hops
in
the
mild
aroma
nice
but
a
little
understated
wow
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
this
one
about
7
or
8
years
i
think
i
am
amazed
how
mild
this
beer
seems
to
me
now
but
still
tastes
the
same
as
i
remember
it
too
mild
tropical
fruity
hop
notes
and
lightly
toasted
grain
the
mild
hop
bitterness
is
well
balanced
by
a
sweet
maltiness
in
the
finish
on
the
leaner
side
of
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
this
was
one
of
the
first
hoppy
beers
i
got
into
when
i
first
got
the
good
beer
bug
along
with
sn
pale
ale
things
have
certainly
changed
since
02
when
this
seemed
like
a
big
beer
but
like
an
old
shoe
it
still
fits
and
it
still
tastes
good
to
me
slight
citrus
hop
aroma
very
toasty
flavor
profile
starts
with
a
lot
of
toasty
and
earthy
flavor
hints
of
caramel
malt
and
semi
sweetness
not
much
hops
for
an
ipa
finishes
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
pine
hops
not
a
hop
head
beer
and
more
of
an
apa
than
ipa
but
a
very
good
tasting
beer
nonetheless
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
almost
seems
thin
to
me
the
beer
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
its
other
missing
qualities
make
it
a
little
more
difficult
to
get
down
d
light
ipa
so
quite
easy
to
drink
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
d
very
drinkable
especially
in
the
summer
d
for
my
first
harpoon
i
really
enjoy
this
some
tasty
ipa
properties
make
this
delicious
i
will
enjoy
these
with
some
greek
dishes
tonight
would
i
buy
more
of
it
i
am
actually
going
to
be
picking
up
a
couple
12packs
tomorrow
to
bring
on
a
camping
trip
this
weekend
its
affordable
and
will
please
the
whole
crew
of
people
that
are
going
i
might
also
pick
up
some
of
their
summer
beer
as
well
d
bottom
line
for
the
price
and
for
the
quality
this
is
a
great
deal
this
is
a
reliable
beer
that
even
nonbeersnobs
enjoy
nicely
balances
quality
with
price
now
it
comes
in
a
12
pack
of
cans
which
is
great
for
the
beach
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
an
easy
choice
at
the
bar
for
a
dependable
ipa
sometimes
i
look
for
a
little
more

not
bad
but
not

good

for
a
6pack

i
had

than
three
and
still
was
enjoying
the
taste
a

drinkability
but
theres
something
a

funky
that
makes
it

oz

appearance
was
a
hazy

color
with
a
thin
frothy

that

taste
was

should
be

and
would
be
good
as
a
beginner
ipa
overall
an
okay
ipa
not
particularly
bad
but
not
noteworthy
in
my
opinion
there
are
many
better
offerings
out
there
at
a
similar
price
point
i
would
buy
a
6
of
these
overall
a
bit
thinbodied
but
a
decent

ipa
to
keep
around

ipa
out

to
see
an
old
friend
in

light
picked
up

single
out
of
an
ice
cold
bucket
says
its
canned
in

ny
appearance
is
solid
with
a
nice
head
although
aroma
seems
a
little
muted
but
that
might
be
to
the
almost
frozen
nature
taste
and
drinkability
are
all
around
solid
as
always
one
of
the
best
everyday
ipas
available
and
the
fact
that
its
now
canned
you
can
almost
insure
that
this
beer
will
be
even
more
ubiquitous
at
almost
every
event
in
new
england
during
the
summer
which
aint
a
bad
thing
cheers
to

sampled
this
beer
in
the
north
train
station
in
boston
tried
on
draft
but
in
a
plastic
cup
the
beer
had
a
pale
amber
colour
with
some
cloudiness
that
cleared
quickly
the
flavour
seemed
like
that
of
a
bit
of
a
started
ipa
the
hop
characters
were
lacking
as
well
as
the
fullness
of
flavour
the
redeeming
qualities
of
this
beer
are
the
nuttiness
weak
smell
is
hard
to
smell
here
taste
is
much
better
than
the
smell
but
not
overly
hopped
or
bitter
it
has
a
nice
refreshing
mouthfeel
but
it
is
well
down
the
list
of
ipas
that
i
would
choose
first

if
consider
it

thoughts
in
my
area
this
beer
is
one
of
the
cheapest
for
a
12
at
roughly
14
this
provides
drinkers
with
hop
flavor
and
a
nice
floral
aroma
a
great
introductory
beer
for
people
getting
into
ipas
definitely
give
it
a
try

its
not
overpowering

aroma

the

the

taste
is
of
hops
very
drinkable

a
very
good

this
is
definetly
a
beer
that
boston
should
be
proud
of
to
be
brewed
here
and
served
in
even
some
of
the

its

its

it

every

restaurant
with
a
crappy
beer
list
and
thank
your
lucky
stars
that
its
there
it
was
even
better
the
smell
was
like

and
the
taste
of
the
hops
not
much
different

malt
to
balance
it
out

that
i
revisit
a
few
times
over
the
year
but
it
is
not
a
staple
ipa
in
my
house
pours
to
a
lasting
foam
head
and
golden
color
the
hop
aroma
is
somewhat
mild
for
a
u
s
ipa
but
is
nonetheless
very
pleasantlots
of
citrusypiney
american
character
flavor
is
light
for
an
ipa
but
sufficiently
hoppy
with
just
enough
malt
character
to
balance
the
bitterness
lightmedium
mouthfeel
very
easy
to
drink
a
session
ipa
if
there
ever
was
one
i
got
this
12
ounze
bottle
from
a
harpoon
mix
case
and
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
had
a
beautiful
ambergoldish
color
with
2
and
a
half
fingers
of
head
there
was
good
retention
not
to
long
not
to
short
there
was
a
lot
of
lace
immediatly
but
it
wasnt
very
sticky
so
it
dissapeared
over
time
the
smell
was
that
of
a
typical
ipa
hoppy
and
spicy
the
mouthfeel
was
not
smooth
but
not
rigid
either
all
in
all
a
solid
brew
dont
drink
and
review
taste
is
bitter
with
citric
notes
hop
aromatic
and
malty
a
nice
balance
the
beer
is
slightly
sticky
and
sizzling
of
the
carbonation
overall
a
very
clean
beer
without
any
signs
of
yeast
fruitness
or
anything
i
expected
the
bitterness
to
be
higher
and
the
beer
less
drinkable
but
i
think
bitterness
grows
on
you
d
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
d
its
a
good
average
ipa
with
floral
hops
instead
of
citrus
its
a
nice
easy
beer
to
drink
would
be
a
good
session
beer
this
is
my
favorite
endall
beer
i
can
find
it
almost
anywhere
and
it
saves
me
from
bud
i
love
the
floral
aroma
it
gives
off
and
the
slight
bite
with
the
initial
sip
its
a
smooth
finish
and
the
residual
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
initial
smell
which
i
like
this
beer
never
deceives
me
pale
amber
color
this
beer
is
very
crisp
too
crisp
for
an
ipa
in
my
opinion
i
didnt
appreciate
the
wateriness
the
aftertaste
was
also
not
as
pleasant
as
i
had
hoped
its
very
dry
and
leaves
a
bitter
bite
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
package
store
i
work
at
sells
a
lot
of
this
so
i
thought
it
would
be
better
the
hops
are
there
piney
but
i
prefer
a
better
malt
backbone
ill
wait
till
i
see
this
on
draft
to
try
it
again
this
ipa
was
an
amber
color
slightly
cloudy
plenty
of
carbonation
the
spicy
hops
aroma
went
pleasantly
with
the
yeast
and
citrus
undertones
as
with
harpoons
other
light
beer
ufo
this
ale
has
very
good
mouthfeel
a
clean
drinking
beer
which
went
extremely
well
with
my
rare
roastbeef
sandwich
the
new
englander
a
great
american
ipa
has
a
great
citrusy
nose
and
taste
cascade
malt
flavor
is
slight
with
a
hint
of
biscuit
the
bitterness
seems
about
medium
for
an
ipa
very
very
drinkable
definitely
an
ipa
for
the
masses
this
is
the
ipa
that
i
tend
to
compare
other
new
american
style
ipas
to
when
i
drink
them
although
i
like
a
bit
more
color
malt
character
and
body
for
my
ideal
ipa
cheers
to
harpoon
for
putting
out
a
great
product
year
after
year
a
nice
solid
and
affordable
ipa
i
picked
at
a
12
pack
at
wegmans
for
13
its
a
touch
light
in
color
and
head
but
has
great
lacing
smells
of
citrus
and
grapefuit
tastes
of
biscuit
malts
and
citrus
hops
a
nice
kick
of
bitterness
but
nothing
you
cant
handle
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
pours
14k
gold
with
good
clarity
creamy
white
head
of
one
and
a
half
fingers
shows
good
retention
and
decent
spotty
lacing
slight
apple
ester
in
the
nose
with
some
mild
chinook
and
cascade
aromas
flash
of
sweet
toasted
malt
upfront
followed
by
a
blast
of
grassy
american
hop
flavor
and
mild
grapefruit
rind
taste
which
then
dissipates
to
a
solid
bitterness
a
pinch
of
highalpha
acid
hop
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
but
mostly
just
a
bland
dry
bitterness
mediumhigh
carbonation
and
lightmedium
body
this
seems
too
crisp
and
light
for
the
style
with
an
unbalanced
bitterness
and
lack
of
hop
flavor
and
aroma
finishes
bitter
but
clean
while
this
very
drinkable
and
devoid
of
any
significant
flaw
its
also
kind
of
boring
decent
medium
bodied
ipa
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
sometime
by
no
means
is
it
the
best
american
ipa
i
have
ever
had
but
theres
also
nothing
wrong
with
it
and
fits
the
bill
when
you
want
a
good
beer
to
drink
while
out
or
sitting
at
home
watching
some
sports
md
that
balance
and
the
smoothness
make
this
a
great
ipa
and
one
of
the
best
ipas
to
session
pours
a
dark
straw
color
with
a
1inch
head
smelled
hoppy
and
grassy
more
herbalflowery
than
anything
hops
take
over
in
the
first
sip
but
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
a
citrusfloral
aftertaste
comes
right
back
up
a
very
nice
balance
good
for
the
hopheads
but
not
so
bitter
that
it
goes
over
the
top
drinkability
and
other
notes
it
certainly
goes
down
smooth
and
easily
but
overall
this
is
a
very
average
beer
it
tastes
like
a
macro
ipa
that
would
appeal
to
the
masses
but
thats
good
for
quaffability
i
have
had
it
ontop
before
and
rember
liking
it
better
in
that
format
drank
too
easy
a
good
ipa
with
a
bit
of
english
influnce
imo
the
bottle
looked
nice
and
it
smelled
just
a
little
hoppy
then
i
took
my
first
sip
and
banghops
hops
and
more
hops
to
the
point
that
it
tasted
like
chlorophyl
i
dont
mind
esbs
so
i
dont
think
it
was
the
bitterness
that
got
me
it
was
just
pungent
i
had
to
pass
it
around
to
get
it
finished
d
off
the
charts
widely
available
in
massachusetts
and
new
england
i
had
reviewed
this
on
tap
earlier
not
much
difference
with
the
bottle
still
a
solid
but
not
spectacular
american
ipa
after
six
more
months
of
reviewing
since
the
last
harpoon
review
i
had
to
downgrade
the
appearance
for
a
less
than
spectacular
head
i
thought
the
taste
was
better
than
i
remembered
from
before
because
the
flavor
comes
out
better
without
the
frosted
beer
mug
from
the
bar
i
had
this
one
with
spicy
chinese
food
and
the
flavor
stood
up
very
well
still
wouldnt
be
my
first
ipa
choice
but
i
would
jump
on
it
is
a
restaurant
if
faced
with
the
usual
boring
choices
id
say
stay
away
if
the
bottled
on
date
is
more
than
a
couple
months
the
flavor
was
malty
citrus
spicy
ending
with
a
mineralness
and
spiciness
wavz
tastes
starts
with
a
strong
very
fruity
hop
apricot
hops
very
sweet
and
very
dry
and
bitter
nice
mix
that
with
a
fruity
crisp
malt
and
you
got
yourself
one
tasty
wellbalanced
ipa
12oz
bottle
pours
fairly
pale
with
medium
carbonation
head
fades
pretty
quickly
but
has
decent
lacing
nice
floral
hoppy
aroma
taste
is
enjoyable
but
a
bit
lacking
and
not
as
full
hoppy
and
fruity
as
i
was
hoping
from
the
aroma
as
this
beer
appears
to
be
pretty
readily
available
in
the
boston
area
i
would
definitely
choose
it
again
when
offered
alongside
the
big
brews
if
no
interesting
micros
are
available
a
very
basic
beer
harpoon
ipa
doesnt
stray
far
from
the
style
at
all
i
think
its
sweeter
than
many
other
ipas
ive
had
and
could
use
a
bit
less
malt
character
and
more
hop
flavor
theres
a
definate
alcohol
flavor
in
this
one
not
unwelcome
but
it
comes
on
a
bit
strong
but
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
and
certainly
an
easy
drinker
decent
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
due
to
a
smooth
and
muted
flavor
this
is
a
good
beginner
ipa
and
a
decent
selection
at
a
new
england
bar
that
doesnt
feature
many
craft
brews
drinkability
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
and
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
them
perfect
for
just
about
any
gathering
recommend
popping
a
few
open
with
some
pungent
cheeses
for
a
lunchtime
treat
its
better
than
average
and
if
not
special
it
does
pack
enough
to
make
it
enjoyable
the
buildingblock
combo
of
malt
and
hops
and
yeast
yield
a
pleasant
character
that
makes
it
crisp
and
drinkable
so
it
may
not
stand
out
in
a
crowd
but
it
does
manage
to
hold
its
own
well
enough
very
good
ipa
especially
for
the
price
when
comparing
to
30
and
up
for
a
case
of
ipa
should
you
buy
it
in
that
manner
it
makes
this
ipa
much
more
attractive
locally
it
is
accessible
for
around
13
a
12
pack
not
the
best
ipa
i
have
tasted
but
above
others
for
me
that
are
more
pricey
good
lawn
mowing
ipa
little
spill
here
or
there
doesnt
make
you
cry
not
my
favorite
thing
to
do
either
but
spillin
a
titan
makes
me
worrysome
this
was
a
flavorful
thirst
quenching
beer
and
a
great
selection
overall
especially
for
the
price
decent
but
plain
the
ipa
class
is
rapidly
becoming
one
of
my
top
favorites
im
still
a
bit
preferential
to
english
bitters
but
if
there
are
more
beers
like
this
one
out
there
i
may
have
to
rearrange
my
priorities
drinkability
goes
down
easy
drinkable
sessionable
better
than
i
remember
drinkability
the
ale
is
very
drinkable
with
a
firm
hop
character
that
is
spicy
without
numbing
the
tastebuds
thanks
to
jeffkrenner
for
the
opportunity
now
enjoy
your
sand
dune
ipa
that
youre
going
to
get
in
return
one
of
my
favorite
american
ipas
or
maybe
its
just
the
weather
pours
to
a
very
pale
orange
with
medium
white
head
and
good
lacing
throughout
strong
citrus
aroma
mostly
grapefruit
lemon
and
orange
with
a
hint
of
floral
fruits
carry
over
to
the
taste
and
leaves
a
good
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
tasting
ipa
at
a
value
price
the
beer
pours
gold
with
a
tall
white
head
smells
very
citrus
with
notes
of
hops
the
sip
starts
bitter
which
lead
to
a
slight
malty
taste
which
is
immediately
replaced
by
hops
it
closes
with
a
slight
alcohol
taste
i
think
its
a
bit
too
carbonated
over
all
its
a
tasty
beer
easy
enough
you
can
drink
a
few
in
a
row
worth
a
try
no
doubt
the
aroma
on
this
was
like
sniffing
a
fat
bag
of
cascade
hopsbeautifully
pungent
a
nice
head
formed
but
then
dissipated
quickly
with
small
dots
of
lace
a
nice
swirl
of
the
glass
brings
it
back
nicely
harpoon
calls
this
a
coppercolored
ale
but
surpisingly
i
found
it
much
lighter
in
color
hops
are
strong
and
first
on
the
palate
if
you
drink
it
slowly
across
the
palate
sweet
flavors
are
revealed
a
vigorous
froth
in
the
mouth
totally
sweetens
this
ipa
and
releases
all
the
wonderful
malt
flavorsamazing
hops
are
steady
through
to
the
finish
the
belch
from
this
ipa
is
heavenly
as
though
i
am
generating
essence
of
cascade
this
ipa
has
all
that
i
love
about
them
killer
aroma
generous
hop
flavor
and
the
malt
flavors
to
boot
with
a
killer
finish
very
drinkable
cheers
pours
a
clear
almost
glowing
orange
color
with
subtle
copper
hues
a
frothy
white
head
develops
quickly
and
stays
intact
for
a
few
moments
before
dissipating
and
leaving
behind
some
nice
lacing
aromas
of
fresh
citrus
juicy
hops
bubble
gum
grass
and
pine
quite
aromatic
and
yet
not
overpowering
or
fearinspiring
the
taste
is
loaded
with
juicy
hops
and
citrusgrapefruit
flavors
but
not
entirely
unbalanced
with
a
mild
but
present
malt
profile
that
grows
over
time
refreshing
and
crisp
this
beer
feels
like
it
is
cleaning
my
tongue
with
every
sip
the
carbonation
adds
a
touch
of
creamlike
texture
to
the
already
silky
and
slighly
oily
mouthfeel
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
with
a
variety
of
dishes
including
mexican
cuisine
and
an
assortment
of
aged
cheeses
overall
a
nice
aipa
not
the
greatest
one
out
there
but
definitely
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
overall
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
while
many
new
ipas
have
certainly
entered
the
realm
of
imperial
or
double
ipa
and
surely
are
jam
packed
full
of
flavor
i
wonder
how
many
reviewers
remember
when
harpoon
was
the
only
company
that
made
one
and
in
94
it
was
certainly
more
hoppy
than
any
beer
i
had
ever
tasted
it
still
holds
up
as
a
great
tasting
brew
that
unique
bubblegum
flavor
poons
yeast
spits
out
really
sits
well
with
the
cascade
nose
really
clean
and
fresh
when
in
boston
hard
to
find
a
better
choice
when
in
the
city
rarely
disappoints
it
seems
to
me
that
many
newbie
ipa
brewers
are
just
masking
nasty
yeast
aroma
or
low
boils
or
lackluster
fermentation
with
huge
amounts
of
hops
alcohol
or
residual
sugar
to
pack
the
flavorful
punch
of
harpoon
into
5
9
and
42
ibus
is
a
testament
to
the
brewers
passion
for
drinkable
beer
md
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
lightly
coats
the
tongue
as
it
goes
down
very
pleasant
it
was
a
nice
intro
to
harpoon
for
me
into
a
pint
glass
it
settled
into
a
dark
gold
color
with
a
slight
head
that
thinned
but
never
completely
disappaited
hoppy
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
slight
citrus
undertones
in
the
aftertaste
but
very
slight
it
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
to
it
and
a
crisp
finish
slight
lacing
in
the
glass
overall
pretty
decent
delicious
in
succession
p
s
its
not
as
pretty
on
tap
not
as
good
a
head
or
lacing
i
find
but
it
may
taste
even
hoppier
poured
into
a
20
oz
pint
glass
a
lite
golden
color
with
hints
of
orange
on
the
sides
a
soft
white
heaed
forms
which
slowly
goes
down
the
glass
slight
visibility
of
carbonation
the
strong
scent
of
flowers
and
citrus
mostly
of
grapefruit
are
the
dominating
aromas
the
taste
comes
in
quickly
with
a
hit
of
malt
then
the
hops
take
over
with
a
citrusy
bitterness
the
mouhtfeel
starts
very
lite
but
it
gains
weight
as
it
crosses
the
palate
the
hops
leave
a
dry
finish
on
the
palate
at
the
end
overall
this
is
an
average
ipa
it
is
not
a
hop
monster
but
it
does
give
that
good
hop
flavor
that
ipas
are
known
for
this
is
a
solid
beer
for
this
style
i
like
hops
yet
i
wont
seek
this
one
out
again
not
bad
but
there
are
too
many
other
interesting
ipas
out
overall
a
decent
better
than
average
drinkable
ale
if
you
like
a
lot
of
hops
and
i
do
than
this
one
will
do
you
right
a
great
warm
weather
beer
very
light
and
tasty
one
i
will
reach
fore
again
nice
aromas
and
appearance
but
the
flavors
are
offbalanced
and
astringent
an
average
tasting
ipa
at
best
time
to
tweak
the
recipe
to
keep
up
with
the
tasty
ipas
of
today
a
very
solid
brew
definitely
worth
trying
although
this
beer
came
to
the
table
with
very
little
head
most
beers
ive
ordered
from
fs
come
that
way
this
ipa
was
a
lighter
crystal
clear
amber
there
was
not
much
floral
hops
in
the
nose
that
ive
come
to
enjoy
from
highlands
kashmir
ipa
this
let
me
down
quite
a
bit
the
first
sip
was
very
dissapointing
but
as
the
beer
warmed
up
a
bit
it
began
to
redeem
itself
toward
the
end
i
was
able
to
pick
up
on
enough
hop
and
balanced
malt
flavor
to
make
me
feel
better
about
this
beer
for
ipas
i
would
not
choose
this
over
most
but
im
sure
theres
plenty
of
crappy
ipas
that
are
far
worse
than
this
mouth
enters
the
mouth
with
very
light
carbonation
that
flattens
as
it
goes
back
has
a
slight
sweetness
to
balance
the
nice
bitter
flavor
and
extremely
hoppy
swallow
slightly
grapy
in
flavor
with
no
lasting
bitterness
overall
its
not
a
bad
brew
its
got
a
great
hop
flavor
but
not
enough
depth
or
balance
and
the
weak
mouthfeel
ruins
the
experience
sort
of
a
dry
mouthfeel
not
bad
overall
might
be
better
reviewed
as
an
apa
though
i
had
this
on
tap
and
in
a
bottle
at
a
local
bar
i
asked
the
bartender
to
just
place
the
two
next
to
each
other
without
my
looking
i
tried
each
and
prefered
the
bottle
i
have
tried
both
before
and
tried
it
on
tap
at
other
places
i
thought
it
was
my
imagination
but
the
bottle
is
better
the
tap
isnt
bad
but
lacks
the
fresh
crispness
that
the
bottle
has
alright
but
not
hoppy
enough
for
an
ipa
to
me
goes
down
nice
and
easy
though
probably
a
good
end
of
the
night
beer
one
thing
worth
mention
is
that
this
tastes
like
is
should
be
more
like
4
55
rather
than
5
9
a
nice
suprise
will
try
this
one
again
cheers
poured
a
nice
peachyapricot
golden
color
with
a
respectable
head
which
lasted
about
2
5
minutes
before
noticeably
subsiding
pleasant
enough
aroma
and
taste
but
neither
were
overwhelming
in
good
or
bad
ways
hoppy
but
indistinguishable
as
far
as
ipas
go
a
crisp
refreshing
choice
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
not
a
hopheads
dream
come
true
still
there
are
less
exciting
ipas
out
there
and
you
could
do
worse
than
harpoons
staple
this
is
a
great
ipa
my
only
criticism
is
the
hop
bitterness
is
a
little
harsh
and
lacking
in
complexity
and
hop
aromas
are
a
little
weak
still
i
can
see
why
this
is
so
ubiquitous
in
boston
tastey
stuff
drinkable
as
hell
thank
you
nicholsons
for
the
cask
you
know
what
i
might
pick
this
up
in
the
summer
if
i
am
not
in
the
mood
for
a
pils
it
is
easy
drinking
and
just
tasty
enough
for
a
nice
summer
afternoon
of
course
at
6
maybe
i
wont
suck
them
down
all
day
but
its
a
nice
change
up
from
a
prima
pils
or
sunshine
pils
overall
a
nice
session
brew
this
would
go
nice
in
a
variety
case
and
nice
to
share
or
drink
a
6er
yourself
it
seems
like
there
are
a
lot
of
great
ipas
and
apas
down
south
refreshing
but
not
all
that
exciting
a
decent
pleasant
session
beer
had
a
bottle
at
rfd
in
washington
dc
served
in
a
tapered
tumbler
something
that
i
thought
wouldnt
help
this
beer
breath
much
average
clear
copper
color
small
head
clean
hops
in
the
nose
and
flavor
the
hops
bite
is
there
but
i
was
not
overwhelmed
by
any
one
aspect
in
this
beer
but
i
couldnt
say
it
was
bad
its
just
not
elite
a
good
regional
ipa
and
maybe
im
prejudiced
because
i
can
score
this
wonderful
beer
for
20
99
a
case
every
day
i
enjoyed
this
beer
on
tap
and
it
had
a
light
appearance
with
a
foamy
head
that
quickly
dissipated
the
aroma
really
wasnt
anything
special
and
was
quite
light
with
a
slight
aroma
of
hoppy
bitterness
and
a
little
bit
of
malt
the
taste
wasnt
overpowering
and
was
crisp
with
a
nice
semibitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
about
average
and
this
beer
wasnt
too
carbonated
but
seemed
to
be
just
right
i
believe
the
drinkability
was
excellent
as
this
beer
had
enough
body
to
it
to
satisfy
me
yet
had
a
clean
finish
and
begged
for
another
round
definately
worth
a
try
this
was
my
first
real
ipa
that
i
ever
had
a
few
years
ago
so
it
does
hold
a
special
place
in
my
heart
however
i
must
say
that
the
taste
has
been
changing
and
there
is
no
consistency
from
batch
to
batch
at
least
from
my
tasting
i
went
to
the
brewery
around
dec
and
it
was
the
best
i
ever
had
it
so
around
feb
i
went
back
up
and
got
another
growler
that
was
keged
about
5
days
before
and
it
was
nowhere
near
as
good
then
i
got
a
12
pack
and
once
again
tasted
different
i
dont
remember
if
the
old
catamount
brewery
makes
any
of
this
or
if
they
just
do
the
100
barrel
but
that
might
explain
the
change
in
taste
i
would
say
try
this
beer
to
break
into
drinking
other
better
beers
d
this
is
where
this
beer
shines
as
light
as
the
body
is
and
since
it
lacks
heavy
hoppyness
and
high
alcohol
i
could
probally
drink
these
all
day
if
given
the
chance
a
very
good
choice
for
a
session
beer
a
little
puckering
but
in
moderation
it
feels
like
a
good
old
ipa
i
know
from
experience
that
this
is
definitely
not
the
ipa
to
over
do
it
with
the
hops
and
spiciness
become
very
monotonous
after
more
than
say
three
bottles
or
glasses
i
could
enjoy
these
once
in
a
while
the
beer
pours
a
weak
golden
color
with
a
2finger
head
that
falls
fairly
quickly
to
a
finger
over
the
brew
this
one
is
very
clear
and
there
is
a
modest
carbonation
working
up
the
aroma
brings
a
nice
caramel
malt
base
with
a
mild
peppery
and
slightly
piny
hop
its
not
overly
complex
but
it
smells
pretty
nice
the
flavor
is
right
on
with
the
aroma
there
is
a
pretty
strong
caramel
sweetness
that
is
interrupted
by
a
solid
pine
and
lighter
citrus
hop
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
rough
but
it
fades
pretty
fast
into
the
sweetness
i
find
the
sweetness
to
be
a
little
over
the
top
and
out
of
balance
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
a
easy
drinking
brew
that
could
easily
find
its
way
into
my
fridge
every
so
often
it
would
be
a
good
change
of
pace
to
some
of
the
standard
ipas
we
have
around
here
not
bad
at
all
ill
leave
the
values
as
they
were
before
overall
i
liked
this
beer
id
definitely
drink
more
of
these
thanks
to
bashiba
for
sharing
this
brew
poured
a
coppertoned
golden
color
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
fizzy
white
one
finger
head
that
gave
way
to
moderate
white
lacing
aroma
is
rich
of
floral
and
citrus
hops
hints
of
grapefruit
also
present
light
maltiness
finishes
out
the
nose
taste
is
primarily
characterized
by
bitter
floralgrassy
hops
almost
balanced
with
some
caramel
malt
flavors
hops
do
not
overpower
in
this
brew
however
they
are
much
stronger
smelling
than
tasting
mouthfeel
is
moderate
to
heavy
carbonation
leaves
a
slight
slick
oily
coating
on
the
mouth
and
throat
drinkability
is
high
lower
abv
and
nice
level
of
complexity
coupled
with
the
refreshment
this
ipa
offers
will
keep
me
coming
back
will
purchase
again
i
think
this
beer
would
make
a
great
session
beer
it
is
not
high
in
alcohol
so
that
wouldnt
be
a
problem
also
the
flavor
is
not
overbearing
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
if
it
was
available
in
so
cal
i
realize
my
scores
are
kinda
odd
with
taste
being
average
to
good
and
drinkability
being
excellent
but
the
reason
is
because
i
know
i
can
always
get
a
six
pack
and
have
a
few
of
them
and
be
perfectly
happy
especially
on
a
nice
warm
day
outside
truly
100
recommended
great
stuff
i
usually
only
buy
singles
but
this
time
i
sprung
for
the
sixpack
and
i
dont
regret
it
not
one
bit
this
beer
is
and
always
has
been
one
of
my
standbys
when
fresh
it
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
ipas
on
the
market
it
is
not
the
most
complex
beer
around
but
the
crisp
bite
of
the
hops
is
something
i
really
enjoy
it
is
floral
and
delicate
but
at
the
same
time
there
is
something
zesty
and
lively
about
it
that
i
really
dig
i
really
enjoy
throwing
down
34
oz
mugs
of
harpoon
ipa
at
wickenden
in
providence
it
is
that
drinkable
overall
a
drinkable
ipa
but
fairly
average
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
maybe
i
will
drinkability
definitely
refreshing
with
layers
of
taste
i
could
handle
one
everyone
once
in
a
while
when
im
relaxing
on
a
hot
day
i
have
been
known
to
drink
this
in
the
summer
down
at
the
beach
i
think
it
goes
with
that
setting
rather
well
much
more
so
than
corona
in
my
opinion
anyway
poured
a
thin
white
head
leaving
dots
of
lace
coppery
color
with
faded
orange
tints
floral
orange
scents
come
to
the
nose
with
hops
present
also
good
creamy
hop
element
going
on
citrusy
and
refreshing
not
a
hopwallop
or
anything
not
even
the
most
robust
ipa
ever
but
definitely
an
enjoyable
brew
one
that
shouldnt
be
turned
down
at
a
good
price
or
if
someone
offers
one
to
you
thirstquenching
and
hugely
drinkable
as
a
dailysession
beer
one
of
the
best
everyday
goto
beers
around
appears
a
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
it
leaves
spotted
lacings
all
over
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
of
a
fruity
origin
taste
is
hoppy
and
flavorful
the
taste
is
more
intense
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
than
it
is
up
front
fruity
but
not
real
citrusy
like
other
ipas
bananas
are
present
in
the
flavor
as
well
overall
this
tastes
good
but
ive
had
better
ipas
mouthfeel
is
decent
and
the
drinkability
is
good
they
go
down
easy
and
i
dont
think
id
get
tired
of
drinking
them
all
night
the
beer
pours
a
transparent
goldenamber
with
a
nice
white
head
that
leaves
a
thin
white
film
all
the
way
down
the
glass
along
with
some
lace
the
smell
is
primarily
hops
that
is
characterized
by
a
nice
mixture
of
citrus
possibly
grapefruit
and
floral
aromas
the
taste
also
exhibits
similar
characteristics
to
the
smell
along
with
some
delightful
bitterness
the
beer
finishes
with
some
sweet
barley
maltiness
the
mouthfeel
is
characterized
by
a
good
thickness
and
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
i
really
enjoy
the
bitterness
and
believe
i
am
begining
to
become
more
of
a
hophead
drinkability
gets
better
as
it
warms
and
starts
out
pretty
average
i
had
this
recently
on
tap
at
the
us
cyclocross
nationals
in
providence
ri
in
the
heated
tent
was
actually
going
for
a
hot
chocolate
had
been
standing
outside
for
hours
in
cold
windy
weather
saw
harpoon
on
tap
decided
on
a
cold
beverage
in
stead
liked
the
tap
much
better
just
seemed
like
more
of
everything
going
on
in
it
good
stuff
drinkability
the
big
complex
hop
flavor
combined
with
light
body
and
only
moderate
bitterness
make
this
one
of
the
few
session
ipas
ive
ever
had
overall
a
great
ipa
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
smooth
crisp
ipa
feel
bitter
sweet
hop
finish
light
copper
orange
color
thin
white
head
that
fades
quickly
tiny
bubbles
of
carbonation
well
after
beer
is
poured
light
smell
of
floral
hops
on
the
nose
taste
is
of
light
hops
a
bit
perfumey
with
a
slightly
sweetened
aftertaste
very
light
and
easy
drinking
imo
a
basic
run
of
the
mill
ipa
very
average
this
is
a
very
nice
ipa
im
glad
were
getting
it
in
florida
anyway
i
agree
with
the
overall
rating
on
this
beer
that
its
worth
a
try
but
thats
about
as
far
as
it
goes
in
my
book
i
like
my
ipas
much
hoppier
than
this
is
this
more
of
an
english
style
ipa
an
ipa
at
all
drinkability
a
little
less
hoppy
than
some
apas
but
can
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
not
a
big
fan
of
ipas
but
hadnt
had
this
in
some
time
and
it
seemed
to
go
well
with
a
game
of
pool
it
was
a
nice
medium
yellow
color
with
a
good
head
and
some
lacing
it
had
a
fresh
crisp
odor
and
a
nice
hoppy
taste
which
got
stronger
after
swallowing
reminded
me
of
summer
drinkability
walking
the
tightrope
between
and
apa
and
an
ipa
the
harpoon
is
an
extremely
wellbalanced
and
drinkable
beer
d
very
good
a
sessionable
ipa
because
it
doesnt
overpower
the
senses
it
still
has
enough
flavor
to
be
enjoyed
on
its
own
or
with
a
meal
cheers
m
d
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
a
good
beer
that
goes
down
smoothly
seems
to
be
one
of
those
staple
good
beers
that
people
bring
to
parties
usually
a
fall
back
for
me
if
there
isnt
anything
else
interesting
at
a
bar
definately
a
drinkable
beer
this
is
an
easy
drinking
ipa
these
guys
at
harpoon
really
know
how
to
make
a
balanced
beer
i
had
almost
forgotten
that
there
can
be
more
than
just
hops
in
an
ipa
pours
a
nice
clean
very
translucent
pale
copper
color
and
makes
a
bit
of
a
head
that
tries
real
hard
to
stick
around
but
fades
into
a
halo
of
white
bubbles
around
the
edge
of
my
glass
floral
earthy
hop
aroma
and
a
hit
of
clean
pale
caramel
malt
clean
crisp
malt
flavor
moderately
bitter
and
strong
sour
citrus
notes
light
in
body
with
a
crisp
and
peppery
carbonated
bite
finishes
dry
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
ale
though
to
me
it
feels
more
like
a
pale
ale
than
an
ipa
i
would
choose
it
over
your
typical
pale
ale
a
solid
drinkable
brew
this
beer
poured
a
nicely
the
head
was
full
frothy
and
lightly
fragant
the
color
was
a
clear
golden
brown
the
smell
contained
elements
of
citrus
and
light
fresh
grains
the
taste
of
hops
in
this
ipa
was
very
thin
however
it
is
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
ill
probably
pick
this
up
again
wish
i
could
find
this
on
tap
around
here
nice
design
and
bottle
cap
this
poured
a
very
nice
golden
color
with
a
great
frothy
head
fairly
sticky
aroma
is
earthy
hint
o
metallicness
but
not
bad
at
all
hoppy
the
taste
is
very
nice
citric
and
pleasant
nice
and
bitey
but
malts
save
the
day
very
good
balance
some
roasty
flavors
in
there
are
very
nice
moderate
body
but
crisp
creamy
very
drinkable
seems
like
it
would
be
a
good
entry
level
beer
for
bud
or
other
shit
addicts
very
pleasant
session
brew
this
beer
poured
out
a
very
slightly
cloudy
light
amber
color
it
has
a
slight
head
the
smell
is
pretty
good
it
smells
of
hops
the
taste
is
of
hops
with
slight
notes
of
spice
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
good
not
much
negativity
to
speak
of
it
does
have
a
slight
bite
to
it
but
not
enought
to
affect
drinkability
overall
a
decent
beer
probably
mid
range
as
far
as
ipas
go
copper
almost
a
brass
color
sticky
inch
and
a
half
head
that
leaves
a
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
floral
aromas
in
the
nose
reminds
me
of
spring
as
the
leaves
green
and
flowers
bloom
not
a
very
hoppy
ipa
but
very
good
and
balanced
bready
malty
tasting
at
first
with
some
citrus
in
the
middle
and
some
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
mouthfeel
is
fair
kinda
sticky
overall
a
very
drinkable
ipa
good
introduction
ipa
and
good
to
throw
down
a
few
smells
light
and
sweet
and
slightly
citrusy
not
great
hard
to
get
a
whiff
of
but
okay
tastes
hoppy
malty
bready
at
the
end
again
not
wonderfully
amazing
but
easy
tasty
enough
and
okay
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
soapy
but
not
in
a
horrid
way
frothy
slightly
slick
dry
at
the
end
very
drinkable
a
decent
good
ipa
i
just
wish
it
was
more
hoppy
with
more
depth
still
you
can
always
find
a
few
in
my
fridge
great
bang
for
your
buck
i
would
order
this
anytime
as
ipas
go
its
on
the
slighter
side
now
but
its
very
well
made
clean
refreshing
hoppy
fruity
and
delicious


i
have
a
soft
spot
for
my
first
and
a
hometown
ipa
im
a
big
fan
great
for
a
first
timer
or
a
more
developed
palate
very
drinkable
tough
to
have
just
one
di
find
this
to
be
the
quintessential
drinking
ipa
its
not

pronounced
in
any
of
the
areas
that
some
ipas
are
prone
to
a
consistent
performer
this
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
nice
two
finger
creamy
tannish
head
say
what
you
want
harpoon
beers
look
good
the
smell
is
a
little
light
with
some
floral
and
yeast
scentsbut
not
any
hops
the
taste
is
light
and
weak
in
an
ipa
i
would
expect
some
hopsbut
this
beer
is
very
much
like
a
lager
with
no
hops
this
doesnt
taste
badbut
its
not
whats
advertised
the
mf
is
lightbut
full
flavored
this
would
be
a
good
session
beerbut
for
an
ipa
its
weak
to
be
honest
im
just
not
a
fan
i
dont
think
i
can
exactly
pinpoint
what
it
is
but
this
beer
just
seems
to
be
too
acidic
for
me
it
has
a
helluva
bite
without
much
reward
its
like
breeding
pitbulls
without
keeping
one
to
protect
the
house
i
looove
hops
but
this
is
just
plain
bitter
not
in
the
good
way
there
just
isnt
anything
to
balance
out
this
brew
i
get
very
little
flavors
other
than
hop
bitterness
perhaps
a
little
bit
of
lemon
anyway
maybe
ill
give
it
a
try
in
the
bottle
since
the
brothers
seem
to
think
it
is
better
that
way
a
big
burst
of
hop
flavor
that
tapers
off
into
a
bitter
sheen
and
a
dryness
on
the
roof
of
my
mouth
pretty
good
stuff
if
you
like
hops
this
is
a
beer
with
some
personality
and
i
can
definitely
drink
these
when
drinking
needs
to
be
done
among
my
favorite
american
indian
pales
me
thinks
this
brew
had
a
orangeyellow
color
that
poured
an
ok
head
that
disipated
quickly
and
left
minimal
lacing
nose
is
of
floral
hops
maltsand
a
hint
of
fruit
as
well
taste
is
a
nice
combonation
of
hops
with
a
hint
of
sweet
malts
mouthfeel
was
decently
full
and
ok
carbonation
overall
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
representative
of
the
style
yeah
i
will
get
this
again
it
would
be
nice
during
football
however
there
are
several
other
pale
alesipas
that
i
can
also
choose
that
have
more
notes
that
i
would
favor
beer
is
good
drinkability
very
light
and
drinkable
though
not
my
favorite
american
ipa
overall
this
is
a
good
ipa
and
is
heartily
recommended
drinkability
this
gets
two
thumbs
up
a
fantastic
beer
that
is
a
great
representative
of
the
style
these
go
down
easy
and
are
completely
enjoyable
lighter
refreshing
body
and
pretty
drinkable
but
completely
lackluster
i
first
had
this
when
it
was
a
seasonal
it
was
also
the
first
smaller
brewery
offering
i
ever
tasted
the
hop
flavor
though
mild
now
in
comparison
to
some
of
the
ipas
was
such
an
eye
opener
it
just
blew
me
away
never
thought
id
see
it
again
living
in
fla
but
found
it
on
tap
about
15
minutes
from
my
house
still
a
pretty
good
lil
ale
but
in
comparison
to
dfh
60min
or
hazed
and
infused
all
on
tap
at
the
same
place
it
seems
a
lil
mild
still
i
manage
to
have
a
pint
or
two
this
may
be
a
good
offering
for
folks
that
normally
drink
macros
as
it
has
significantly
more
flavor
but
probably
wont
blow
their
heads
off
good
for
the
style
and
a
good
brew
ahhh
the
harpoon
ipa
i
distinctly
remember
this
as
the
first
indian
pale
ale
i
have
ever
tried
this
beer
alone
catapulted
me
into
the
world
of
ipas
and
amber
ales
that
i
enjoy
today
from
the
second
i
removed
the
cap
of
this
ale
i
was
immediately
filled
with
a
sensation
of
a
beautiful
spring
day
the
floral
scents
of
this
ale
are
awe
inspiring
but
not
overdone
as
i
poured
the
beer
into
the
only
available
pint
glass
left
in
the
kitchen
beer
was
stored
refrigerated
and
had
a
shelf
life
of
less
than
one
week
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
golden
amber
color
and
a
nice
thick
head
that
stays
around
for
a
couple
minutes
but
doesnt
leave
a
lace
like
most
macro
beers
do
and
can
only
compare
to
craft
beers
the
aroma
of
hops
complemented
the
wonderful
color
of
this
beer
and
the
taste
was
nothing
short
of
climatic
the
mouthfeel
for
a
beer
of
this
nature
was
extraordinary
by
far
the
first
beer
that
i
was
really
able
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
since
then
i
have
tried
the
ipa
with
a
barrage
of
foods
and
find
italian
and
cajun
cuisine
complement
the
taste
of
this
beer
very
well
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
interested
in
the
field
of
american
ipas
i
usually
try
and
bring
a
twelve
pack
on
the
plane
back
to
chicago
when
i
travel
out
east
overall
harpoon
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
isnt
anything
truly
special
but
will
always
be
around
as
someone
close
to
boston
i
consider
it
the
gateway
to
ipas
when
u
start
expanding
your
taste
it
is
probably
a
good
choice
to
figure
out
what
ipas
are
all
about
the
old
standby
much
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
looks
more
creamy
with
more
body
active
carbonation
and
clarity
smells
pineey
hoppy
mildly
sweet
and
very
citrusy
tastes
much
more
citrusy
than
through
the
bottle
more
crisp
and
refreshing
just
more
alive
mouthfeel
is
a
good
blend
of
bubbly
and
creamy
crisp
and
mildly
dry
in
the
finish
less
metalic
tiney
and
thin
than
the
bottle
this
suddenly
became
a
good
beer
i
recommend
this
beerbut
only
on
tap
golden
amber
very
clear
big
white

nice
lacing
smell
is
pine
and
citrus
hops
crystal
caramel
malt
honey
sweetness
taste
is
piney
some
light

flavour
citrus
near
the
end
clean
bitter
finish
lighter
bodied
medium
carbonation
smooth
and
refreshing
tasty
ipa
that
being
said
its
still
a
good
beer
i
still
got
a
little
hopburping
in
and
ill
certainly
never
turn
down
a
pint
of
harpoon
ipa
pours
a
very
light
colored
amber
with
a
bubbly
white
head
slightly
orange
looking
smells
a
little
bubblegummish
tastes
quite
malty
with
little
hop
presence
finish
is
cirtusy
grapefruit
why
is
this
an
ipa
malt
character
pretty
much
overpowers
the
hops
this
is
a
decent
tasting
beer
but
not
what
i
expected
if
you
want
a
nice
ipa
try
a
founders
if
you
want
an
entry
level
ipa
try
this
guy
one
ive
had
and
seen
quite
a
bit
but
never
took
the
time
to
review
sadly
this
ipa
is
a
product
of
the
past
before
bigger
meant
better
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
cant
hold
a
candle
to
the
new
wave
of
american
ipas
out
there
medium
body
of
reddish
brown
with
syrupy
scents
of
caramel
and
biscuit
hopfeel
is
minimal
for
an
ipa
but
still
adds
a
soft
bitterness
to
the
finish
and
some
nondescript
coniferous
notes
to
the
middle
id
take
it
over
a
macro
any
day
and
when
i
see
it
on
tap
i
typically
buy
it
but
i
can
easily
think
of
2
dozen
ipas
id
have
before
this
the
classy
label
adds
to
the
bottles
appearance
overallby
no
means
bad
simply
ok
though
unbalanced
and
mediocre
and
from
a
brewery
this
loved
dissapointing
this
tastes
pretty
good
i
would
say
that
the
flavor
is
leaning
slightly
toward
the
hop
end
of
the
scale
but
not
by
much
this
might
be
a
good
way
to
introduce
someone
to
craft
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
despite
the
moderate
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
good
although
i
wouldnt
have
too
many
since
i
prefer
beers
that
smack
me
upside
my
head
with
flavor
very
drinkable
ipa
and
great
session
beer
if
slighly
higher
in
abv
than
a
standard
session
beer
beer
courtesy
of
ski271
thanks
again
overall
a
great
ipa
the
citrus
hops
really
continue
throughout
the
taste
always
feel
confident
with
this
ipa
an
old
standby
if
i
can
find
it
purchased
as
part
of
sampler
pack
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
smell
is
loaded
with
hops
taste
leaves
a
nice
dry
hop
bitterness
that
is
pleasantly
enjoyable
finishes
dry
and
bitter
with
the
feeling
of
wanting
more
another
good
beer
from
harpoon
the
mouth
feel
is
surprisingly
light
for
an
ipa
and
is
nice
and
refreshing
its
nothing
amazing
but
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
its
worth
a
try
drinkability
a
very
good
ipa
tasty
and
refreshing
finally
got
to
try
it
during
a
recent
trip
to
boston
and
it
was
as
good
as
expected
colour
was
a
dark
yellow
with
a
nice
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
on
the
glass
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
it
would
definitely
be
one
of
my
regular
ipas
if
i
could
buy
it
down
here
this
is
a
good
ipa
harpoon
ipa
is
the
light
in
the
darkness
when
at
a
new
bar
with
a
mostly
poor
beer
selection
it
can
always
be
found
in
my
fridge
or
cooler
on
a
camping
trip
its
so
easy
to
drink
and
full
of
flavor
i
cant
see
why
anyone
would
want
another
session
beer
another
brew
from
the
midwest
beer
barge
trade
with
tikkigodxxx
a
great
opportunity
to
sample
some
fine
beer
that
doesnt
normally
make
it
to
the
left
coast
body
is
light
to
medium
with
a
grainy
dry
mouthfeel
its
not
bad
for
budget
sessioning
but
i
think
it
used
to
taste
better
10
years
ago
perhaps
my
tastes
have
just
changed
too
a
great
ipa
to
start
with
is
harpoons
the
harpoon
brewery
makes
great
brews
but
their
ipa
may
be
the
most
accessible
of
any
variety
the
beer
pours
up
a
dark
goldcopper
color
with
a
thick
white
head
of
foam
leaving
lace
on
the
glass
as
the
contents
are
drunk
the
aroma
offered
is
wheat
or
sweet
hay
with
some
hints
of
fruit
spicy
orange
the
taste
is
moderately
bitter
not
as
hoppy
as
many
ipas
out
there
but
the
beer
has
a
great
deal
of
carbonation
balancing
out
the
bitterness
making
the
beer
extremely
smooth
and
very
drinkable
unlike
some
aggressivelyhopped
beers
you
can
drink
many
harpoons
ipa
without
getting
overwhelmed
or
turned
off
by
the
taste
of
repeated
bottles
a
very
refreshing
beer
for
the
summer
days
enjoy
the
brews
cheers
drinkability
was
soso
overall
a
decent
but
not
great
ipa
fairly
crisp
and
drinkable
with
a
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
this
is
just
a
solid
decent
ipa
sweet
taste
lingers
then
dries
out
quickly
very
drinkable
beer
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
taking
another
trip
to
boston
to
partake
of
this
beer
again

that

pours
are

the

my
go

im
glad
its
local
and
ready
for
me
overall
seems
kind
of
like
a
dumbeddown

thats
cool
i
need
more
beers
that
i
can
just
drink
and
not
have
to
think
about
the
massive
amount
of
flavors
involved
in
them
this
is
a

straight

its
damn
good
for
what
it
is
this
along

nice

the

where
this

really
comes
through
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
with
a
perfect
amount
of
bitterness
for
an
ipa
there
is
some
room
for
improvement
here
but
i
couldnt
tell
you
where
very
good
one
i
will
buy
again
the
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
thick
with
nice
low
carbonation
it
is
an
easy
drinker
and
may
be
a
decent
session
type
beer
would
be
easy
to
pair
with
food
i
used
to
really
love
this
beer
but
i
feel
as
if
its
lost
some
of
its
hoppiness
or
maybe
its
just
my
taste

have
changed
over

years

on

good

floral
hoppy
aroma
taste
is
smooth
hoppy
but
not
that
hoppy
and
not
all
that
complex
id
actually
push
this
one
down
into
the
pale
ale
category
has
a
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
refreshing
a
good
beer
but
in
the
middle
of
the
ipa
pack
a
pretty
average
tasting
ipa
it
does
have
a
refreshing
mouthfeel
and
high
drinkability
and
i
do
like
a
few
of
the
more
subtle
flavors
recommended
although
not
strongly
the
first
whiff
was
awesome
it
had
a
real
funky
grassy
hop
aroma
that
was
unfortunately
difficult
to
detect
after
the
first
few
sips
bright
offwhite
head
poured
fairly
thick

everything
out

clean

burps
taste
of
hops
yum
moderately
light
body
and
solid
hoppiness
help
this
one
down
a
solid
fresh
hoppy
beer
the
beer
pours
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
smallish
pearl
white
head
and
a
pale
yellow
color
thats
slightly
on
the
light
side
for
an
ipa
leaves
nice
white
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
floral
bouqet
of
hops
with
a
citrusy
note
as
well
spot
on
for
an
ipa
the
taste
is
pretty
much
dominated
by
the
hops
with
a
slight
maltiness
but
this
is
not
so
bitter
as
to
turn
away
non
hop
heads
you
can
detect
many
complex
hops
tastes
with
a
floral
citrusy
and
slightly
resiny
hop

coating
your
mouth
thats
interrupted
slightly
by
a
caramel
malt
taste
then
quickly
finishes
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
this
is
really
a
fantastic
ipa
that
could
be
drunk
for
hours
and
in
im
opinion
would
be
a
good
beer
to
convert
someone
to
the
glory
of
hops
as
it
is
not
so
bitter
as
to
turn
people
off
but
bitter
enought
to
keep
the
hopheads
interested
drinkabilitynotes
although
it
is
not
one
of
my
favored
styles
this
is
a
very
good
ipa
certainly
worth
a
try
thanks
to
hardtarget
for
sharing
this
suprising
find
at
my
local
beer
store
about
a
cross
between
a
sam
adams
and
a
really
good
ipa
the
smell
is
there
nice
appearance
and
lacing
it
seems
like
a
good
ipa
spiked
with
water
bitter
enough
for
the
style
but
just
too
thin
you
could
blast
through
a
few
of
these
with
no
problem
maybe
a
good
gateway
ipa
but
im
way
beyond
the
gateway
at
this
point
followed
by
a
titan
and
an
indiga
both
of
which
really
blew
it
away
ive
been
drinking
a
lot
of
these
lately
because
well
its
very
drinkable
and
i
guess
they
are
just
getting
it
out
there
and
it
has
been
on
special
at
the
last
few
bars
ive
been
to
pours
a
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
pleasant
spicy
citrusy
hop
aroma
but
i
was
expecting
more
from
an
ipa
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
also
hops
do
not
dominate
as
they
should
in
an
ipa
a
decent
easy
drinking
beer
but
there
are
better
choices
out
there

head
that
stuck
all
over
the
glass
for
ages
smelled
of
citrus
and
pine
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
hiding
in
the
background
the
moderate
carbonation
complemented
the
significant
but
not
overpowering
citric
hoppiness
which
was
balanced
by
a
notinsignificant
malt
sweetness
while
the
hops
were
a
big
part
of
the
flavor
i
didnt
find
that
they
were
significantly
bitter
which
makes
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
although
the
5
9abv
limits
this
a
bit
the
overall
impression
is
smooth
and
crisp
a
short
dry
finish
rounds
off
a
solid
american
ipa
that
is
a
goto
in
bostonarea
bars
overall
impression
a
refreshing
ipa
with
low
bittering
flavors
if
it
were
a
tad
more
local
i
could
see
making
it
a
regular
beer
drinkability
really
helps
the
score
generally
this
ipa
is
pretty
average
and
frankly
a
little
boring
this
aipa
pours
dark
golden
amber
with
a
slight
haze
non
descript
white
head
and
just
a
smattering
of
lacing
laid
back
grainy
hops
in
the
nose
cant
say
im
overwhelmed
by
this
ipa
hop
crunch
is
quite
subdued
sort
of
a
mushy
feel
to
the
center
and
body
of
this
brew
finish
is
equally
mundane
cmon
harpoon
i
feel
like
this
one
has
been
sliding
downwards
the
past
few
years
not
the
punchy
and
flavorful
ipa
i
remember
mediumlight
mouthfeel
great
drinkability
as
this
one
isnt
hop
overkill
like
so
many
others
from
this
style
drinkability
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
easydrinking
beer
its
not
as
bold
as
i
would
expect
an
am
ipa
to
be
but
it
good
enough
to
make
me
really
wish
i
had
more
than
one
bottle
i
like
all
different
styles
of
beer
and
often
treat
myself
to
more
exotic
potions
depending
on
the
season
but
this
ipa
is
great
anytime
of
the
year
regardless
of
temperature
or
occassion
pours
a

very
fuity

fairly

with
more

on

than
i
usually
find
in

but
this
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
the

hops
complement
this
and
leave
a
decent
bitterness
well
balanced
but
i
think
it
could
still
use
an
extra
shot
of
hops
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
alternative
to
the
other
stagnant
beers
this
establishment
tends
to
throw
your
way
i
can
easily
have
a
few
of
these
at
one
sitting
and
not
get
tired
of
them

closes

with

are
excellent

nice

from

a
clean
dark

beer
has
a
big
bright

foamy
head
and
some
good
lace
the
aroma
has
a
sweet
citrusy
sharp
hop
character
with
a
hint
of
malt
in
the
background
the
taste
starts
with
a
sweet
citrusy
tease
followed
by
a
blast
of
hops
bitterness
and
has
a
nice
refreshing
clean
hop
finish
very
nice
the
taste
profile
is
fairly
mellow
mildly
citric
and
modestly
bitter
without
any
intention
of
crossing
over
into
bold
territory
it
is
completely
unoffensive
and
quite
drinkable
but
lacks
the
full
character
that
this
style
can
display
a
little
uninspiring
in
terms
of
the
style
drinkability
overall
a
pretty
good
pint
and
not
bad
for
a
session
i
had
the
opportunity
to
sample
it
a
couple
times
over
several
days
and
my
impressions
didnt
really
change
i
definitely
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
one
sitting
its
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
it
would
probably
go
well
as
a
session
beer
if
you
havent
had
this
yet
i
definitely
recommend
it
for
someone
who
is
not
the
biggest
fan
of
american
ipas
i
absolutely
loved
this
one
persoanlly
harpoon
ipa
or
the
cottonwood
endo
are
the
best
of
its
style
ive
tried
so
far
poured
a
nice
amber
colored
hue
that
filled
the
glass
with
much
carbonation
and
head
rentention
sparkled
in
the
mouth
and
the
hops
was
not
overbearing
will
definitely
try
this
again
reflection
not
as
hoppy
as
i
like
my
ipas
but
as
a
pale
ale
this
would
be
great
with
the
good
flavor
and
nothing
over
the
top
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
notes
well
balanced
and
not
over
the
top
i
like
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
not
west
coast
overhopped
craziness
pours
an
orangish
amber
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
fades
quickly
i
dont
know
what
they
use
for
a
yeast
in
this
beer
but
it
has
a
strong
ringwood
flavor
to
me
hints
of
butterscotch
for
an
ipa
its
rather
lacking
in
hoppiness
the
hops
get
lost
in
the
maltiness
of
this
beer
an
okay
beer
that
i
could
drink
1
or
2
of
in
an
evening
but
that
would
be
it
tastes
more
like
an
english
pale
ale
to
me
than
an
ipa
drinkability

it
would
be
hard
to
keep
drinking
this
all
night
although
i
live
out
west
i
can
still
appreciate
a
good
east
coast
ipa
but
this
just
isnt
it
ive
had
this
beer
from
tap
and
from
the
bottle
in
both
this
beer
is
fantastic
very
hopy
with
no
other
flavors
to
get
in
the
way
a
really
perfect
ipa
it
has
a
nice
color
slightly
dark
and
reddish
brown
it
is
very
drinkable
and
you
dont
get
tired
of
it
its
good
till
the
end
like
all
good
ipas
should
be
luckily
this
beer
is
very
popular
in
boston
and
i
hope
if
i
ever
move
it
is
popular
where
i
live
this
beer
pours
a
flourescent
orange
color
with
a
medium
bright
white
head
lots
of
bubbles
rush
to
the
top
the
scent
was
restrained
at
first
but
i
picked
up
more
notes
the
further
i
went
along
there
seems
to
be
a
real
strong
floral
pungency
in
here
along
with
citrus
notes
from
what
appeared
to
be
dry
hopping
but
im
not
sure
about
that
the
taste
was
a
bit
restrained
there
was
no
real
dominating
flavor
but
a
big
mix
of
estery
hops
caramel
malt
and
a
grainlike
huskiness
around
the
edges
the
body
was
a
bit
thin
and
that
hurt
this
beer
a
little
all
in
all
a
decent
but
underwhelming
beer
not
really
an
ipa
but
not
subtle
enough
to
be
a
good
pale
ale
this
should
be
the
official
beer
of
boston
a
perfect
combo
of
big
american
ipas
and
british
pale
ales
one
of
the
best
boston
session
beers
ever
there
is
plenty
of
taste
in
this
beer
it
leans
toward
the
malty
side
and
im
sure
would
be
better
with
more
hops
taste
and
aroma
still
i
liked
it
and
ill
buy
more
drinkability
a
good
quaffer
not
in
the
upper
echelon
but
an
easy
and
satisfying
choice
i
always
try
to
get
my
wife
to
try
ipas
because
its
one
style
i
cant
seem
to
convert
her
to
usually
she
makes
a
face
and
says
its
too
bitter
when
i
offered
her
te
harpoon
her
response
was
nothing
great
but
i
could
actually
drink
this
ipa
enough
said
about
the
hop
profile
ipa
i
know
more
apas
with
more
hops
than
this
beer
unless
they
want
to
appeal
to
the
macro
drinkers
i
would
consider
this
a
light
ipa
goodness
go
grab
a
hopdevil
and
see
how
its
done
correctly
gold
color
with
nice
foamy
head
head
has
a
bitter
bite
but
has
good
legs
their
is
a
spicy
hop
aroma
their
is
a
light
malt
taste
with
hop
bitterness
and
a
slight
lemony
aftertaste
the
body
is
lightthin
could
use
more
malt
to
balance
this
brew
drinkability
when
i
want
a
good
plain
ol
ipa
this
is
the
one
i
reach
for
its
a
fine
session
beer
as
well
had
this
at
a
number
of
places
on
tap
while
visiting
boston
it
was
the
only
thing
worth
drinking
at
both
hotels
i
stayed
in
it
was
a
cool
amber
color
with
a
small
frothy
head
that
held
througout
the
drink
had
a
hoppy
floral
smell
tasted
pretty
much
the
same
not
too
bitter
sweet
malt
flavor
too
crisp
fresh
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
i
would
recommend
this
one
on
this
beer
is
an
old
staple
pretty
standard
for
an
american
ipa
but
reliable
and
damn
good
appears
a
little
bubbly
actually
but
theres
a
nice
frothy
head
present
that
leaves
a
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
citrus
and
piney
hops
typical
for
an
ipa
of
course
tastes
great
to
me
just
what
i
would
expect
from
harpoon
lots
of
hop
flavor
less
malt
and
with
a
little
bitter
kick
towards
the
end
smooth
mouthfeel
although
a
little
fizzy
but
generally
impressive
this
is
a
solid
beer
great
for
pretty
much
any
occasion
such
as
watching
the
sox
game
which
i
am
going
to
go
do
now
white
head
capping
a
golden
body
with
a
constant
stream
of
bubbles
great
fruity
hop
aroma
with
only
a
hint
of
malt
flavor
is
a
bit
weak
but
nice
weak
mouthfeel
boring
but
drinkable
as
with
the
harpoon
beers
ive
tried
its
a
nice
drinkable
beer
but
a
bit
more
bland
than
i
prefer
your
basic
run
of
the
mill
east
coast
ipa
it
pours
a
nondescript
crisp
amber
colour
with
a
fairly
thin
head
the
smell
is
much
more
sweet
than
i
remember
it
actually
dominating
the
hop
and
bread
notes
at
times
floral
notes
are
scattered
throghout
as
well
as
for
the
flavour
the
hop
and
malt
balance
is
nicely
combined
with
the
floral
and
sweet
notes
picked
up
in
the
nose
however
everything
is
pretty
bland
overall
here
i
remember
this
brew
being
much
hoppier
years
ago
now
it
seems
as
if
its
produced
more
for
the
masses
its
easy
drinking
and
its
nice
to
know
that
youre
likely
to
find
it
at
any
bar
in
greater
boston
even
the
dumpiest
of
dives
most
likely
this
is
certainly
still
a
good
beer
all
around
but
like
most
harpoon
offerings
seems
to
have
peaked
a
while
ago
crank
it
up
on
all
accounts
i
say
beautiful
medium
gold
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
lovely
hop
aromas
abound
sweet
malt
lends
a
good
depth
to
the
nose
hops
lend
great
flavor
to
the
palate
and
the
malt
is
quite
noticable
not
as
hoppy
as
i
was
hoping
for
but
a
nice
east
coast
ipa
nice
mouthfeel
sweetness
give
some
viscosity
and
a
coating
effect
a
delightful
ipa
flavorful
balanced
and
well
made
i
like
this
and
was
glad
to
get
to
try
it
cant
wait
to
try
again
look
for
this
one
i
was
fairly
excited
to
see
that
one
of
my
favorite
local
watering
holes
had
this
on
tap
so
after
a
quick
pint
of
celebration
i
decided
to
go
for
a
harpoon
ipa
i
have
no
doubts
that
drinking
this
right
after
a
celebration
made
my
expectations
of
this
ipa
unreasonably
high
it
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
1
finger
head
that
made
itself
present
for
about
8
ounces
nose
is
rather
muted
when
compared
to
the
celbrations
some
floral
hops
are
present
as
is
some
malty
sweetness
taste
wasnt
the
hop
attack
that
i
was
expecting
this
was
rather
clean
and
balanced
with
a
caramelish
malt
background
keeping
the
hops
in
their
place
nice
medium
body
to
this
one
too
definately
a
decent
beer
but
itll
be
hard
for
me
to
choose
this
of
an
alpha
king
or
celebration
when
all
3
are
side
by
side
on
the
palate
it
is
straightforward
offering
toffeeflavored
malt
impressions
along
with
scorched
stone
fruits
dry
honey
flavors
and
herb
oils
its
hard
to
understand
the
very
pale
yellow
color
in
light
of
the
impact
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
medium
in
length
and
balanced
solid
effort
drinkability
is
dangerous
easy
to
get
carried
away
and
have
too
many
of
these
i
definately
will
not
be
buying
this
again
pours
a
nice
cloudy
ambercopper
hue
under
a
slightly
offwhite
one
finger
head
that
settles
pretty
quickly
but
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
marvellous
flowery
nose
balanced
by
some
barley
but
clearly
hops
are
the
main
attraction
the
mouth
is
prickly
yet
smooth
with
a
heaviness
to
the
texture
that
coats
the
mouth
and
tongue
almost
like
thin
syrup
theres
definitely
a
sweet
malt
backbone
here
which
does
a
good
job
of
supporting
the
hops
which
are
present
from
the
beginning
definitely
not
a
superhopped
brew
the
flowery
sweet
and
crisp
bitter
nevertheless
determine
the
flavor
experience
a
deeper
bite
emerges
briefly
in
the
aftertaste
but
the
flowers
linger
remarkably
long
theres
no
impression
of
espresso
here
its
more
like
perfume
nice
light
copper
color
with
a
decent
long
lasting
head
aroma
was
lightly
hopped
taste
was
dominated
with
hops
with
just
enough
malt
to
make
it
enjoyable
body
was
light
for
the
style
but
you
could
drink
a
number
of
these
on
a
hot
afternoon
very
refreshing
and
flavorful
a
very
drinkable
ipa
not
too
hoppy
for
the
style
nice
brew
but
not
more
than
a
crisp
hoppy
brew
a
little
one
dimensional
but
tasty
and
smooth
make
it
a
good
beer
to
have
with
some
friends
being
from
the
area
i
cant
believe
i
havent
reviewed
at
least
one
of
harpoons
offerings
before
a
fine
american
ipa
a
gloriously
golden
pour
with
moderate
pure
white
head
carbonation
makes
a
nice
visual
effect
in
this
clear
beer
smell
is
crisp
and
hoppy
taste
is
sweet
and
fairly
bitter
refreshing
on
a
real
hot
day
like
today
a
good
choice
if
in
need
of
an
ipa
this
is
truly
one
of
my
staple
beers
either
in
a
restaurantbar
or
as
a
6
or
12
pack
the
majority
of
the
time
i
get
this
ipa
fresh
and
im
always
pleased
probably
my
favorite
consistent
product
from
harpoon
upon
pouring
it
had
a
nice
golden
amber
color
and
a
good
head
the
smell
was
typical
for
the
ipas
ive
had
smelling
hoppy
and
malty
the
taste
didnt
have
as
much
bite
as
i
expected
and
the
malt
mellowed
it
out
a
bit
a
bit
of
spiciness
though
added
just
enough
tingle
with
the
carbonation
i
wasnt
done
with
the
first
one
before
i
was
ready
for
the
next
one
i
cant
wait
to
get
back
to
new
england
for
some
more
well
made
ipa
definitely
skewed
towards
the
hops
clean
and
straightforward
drinkability
well
as
far
as
ipas
go
the
lamb
of
drinkability
must
be
sacrificed
to
the
gods
of
hops
i
cant
beleive
i
just
wrote
that
in
harpoons
take
this
is
not
so
the
cleanness
is
a
plus
in
this
category
tawny
gold
in
hue
lighter
in
color
for
an
ipa
minimal
animation
largely
clear
in
appearance
a
white
head
of
one
finger
in
height
topped
the
beer
the
head
retention
was
fair
after
a
moment
it
slid
to
a
loose
cap
the
subsequent
lacing
was
spotty
and
it
didnt
cling
well
the
nose
is
very
lovely
the
hoppiness
is
apparent
but
the
fruity
aromas
really
take
this
beer
to
the
next
level
oranges
peaches
a
trace
of
lemon
zest
and
some
wild
berries
construct
the
marmalade
fruitiness
the
hops
add
some
straight
acidic
notes
overall
the
potency
of
the
bouquet
is
solid
and
i
find
the
total
package
to
be
inviting
the
palate
is
very
good
it
is
an
east
coast
ipa
all
the
way
that
is
not
a
negative
comment
the
bitterness
is
moderate
but
fairly
pronounced
the
acidity
is
modest
but
the
hops
are
pleasantly
juicy
in
the
middle
the
fruitiness
really
sings
oranges
and
peaches
mainly
a
hint
of
grapes
that
is
a
wonderful
combination
of
fruit
now
add
in
the
hops
yum
the
maltiness
is
a
tickle
weak
imo
it
doesnt
really
add
much
aside
from
a
hint
of
caramel
regardless
the
other
aspects
of
this
beer
are
very
positive
medium
in
body
somewhat
low
carbonation
it
is
natural
and
pleasing
the
mouthfeel
is
good
i
could
drink
this
beer
routinely
if
it
was
available
to
me
locally
of
course
it
is
simply
lovely
stuff
thank
you
drweizen
for
including
this
in
bif
5
the
taste
was
of
sharp
tangy
bitter
hops
with
touches
of
citrus
again
it
tasted
like
pure
cascade
to
me
quite
delightful
this
draft
ipa
was
served
in
a
harpoon
glass
with
little
head
and
no
room
for
one
what
was
there
added
a
bit
of
lace
to
the
glass
as
i
consumed
the
rosetinted
gold
ale
the
pungent
casacade
hop
aroma
is
a
fair
advertisement
for
the
initial
grapefruitsour
flavors
as
the
beer
warms
or
it
kills
whatever
taste
buds
were
repulsed
by
the
unbalanced
and
rather
predictable
hop
assault
some
more
interesting
tealike
flavors
emerge
to
compliment
an
understated
malt
body
its
a
passable
ipa
but
nothing
that
id
pursue
at
first
im
loving
it
but
it
has
no
balance
or
other
dimension
and
gets
boring
after
a
while
by
the
time
i
get
to
the
end
im
ready
to
move
on
to
something
else
deep
amber
color
not
much
of
a
head
but
good
lacing
regardless
spicy
hop
aroma
hoppy
orange
flavor
nice
but
not
very
special
tingly
mouthfeel
finish
is
clean
and
a
bit
dry
good
and
refreshing
more
hoppiness
would
be
nice
though

special
at
the
corner
deli
swiggable
ipa
but
lacked
a
little
flavor
a
bit
on
the
middle
of
the
road
side
this
one
pours
a
very
pale
orange
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
there
is
an
ample
amount
of
lace
that
clings
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
is
citrusy
and
the
hops
waft
up
into
the
nostrils
in
abundance
the
taste
is
of
couse
hop
topped
and
citrusy
as
well
this
is
a
good
ipa
in
my
opinion
it
has
the
extra
hops
but
not
so
it
knocks
you
over
i
enjoyed
this
brew
in
fact
i
was
with
some
fairly
mainstream
drinkers
at
a
work
function
and
we
started
talking
about
hops
i
let
them
sniff
my
empty
glass
and
most
of
them
realized
they
had
never
experienced
that
in
a
beer
before
better
yet
several
ordered
an
ipa
for
their
next
round
there
is
hope
this
ipa
pours
lighter
than
mosta
rich
clear
golden
tint
topped
off
by
a
medium
thick
white
head
the
hops
are
delightfully
abundant
to
the
nose
complemented
by
a
complex
floral
arrangement
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
both
lighter
than
the
usual
for
this
style
the
hops
are
not
as
dominant
in
the
taste
as
in
the
smell
and
the
citrus
moves
more
into
the
forefront
a
good
light
and
smooth
ipa
for
a
warm
eveningi
could
have
a
number
of
these
came
from
the
tap
dark
golden
with
a
nice
light
aroma
and
light
hoppiness
in
the
scent
very
light
head
retention
left
with
a
very
thin
coating
heavy
lacing
there
is
light
bitterness
and
decent
flavor
very
drinkable
brew
a
nice
allseason
kind
of
a
beer
great
potential
for
a
session
beer
a
decent
pale
ale
but
hardly
an
ipa
decent
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
stellar
overall
a
good
beer
the
bitter
taste
would
ward
me
off
from
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
in
one
session
a
clear
lightly
golden
brew
with
little
to
no
head
aroma
is
really
pleasant
with
faint
caramel
floral
hops
a
touch
of
fruit
initial
tastes
are
sweet
malt
caramel
hop
flavor
comes
in
nicely
to
balance
this
brew
out
provide
a
lingering
bitterness
the
beer
is
enjoyable
but
does
not
have
the
hop
punch
i
was
really
hoping
for
that
said
it
is
very
drinkable
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
nice
looking
amber
ale
with
decent
white
head
fresh
flowery
hops
define
the
smell
the
taste
starts
with
flowery
citrus
hops
up
front
with
slight
toasted
caramel
malt
background
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
and
a
clean
finish
not
bad
at
all
but
on
tap
this
is
significantly
better
overall
not
bad
for
the
5
i
paid
but
after
this
sixpack
is
gone
it
wont
be
returning
to
my
beer
stash
prickly
citric
hops
the
malt
portion
of
the
aroma
is
limited
to
a
light
crackerlike
breadiness
hop
dominated
flavor
while
the
bitterness
isnt
overwhelming
the
lack
of
malt
really
helps
to
bring
forth
the
hop
flavor
very
citric
and
crisp
but
theres
nothing
here
to
keep
this
from
being
too
onedimensional
in
a
not
entirely
pleasant
way
ehh
this
is
the
standard
ipa
a
bit
too
bitter
even
for
the
style
not
balanced
by
many
hop
flavors
wheres
the
aroma
hops
im
not
very
familiar
with
the
brewery
but
this
was
a
diappointment
i
will
not
try
it
again
this
is
a
good
all
around
ipa
its
not
big
in
any
one
category
but
drinkable
and
flavorful
smell
is
unmistakenly
hops
cannot
go
wrong
there
taste
is
a
hoppy
citrusy
flavor
with
a
dry
finish
well
balanced
but
without
a
strong
malt
backbone
like
with
the
hop
devil
this
is
probably
more
of
a
session
ipa
than
many
others
i
like
this
a
lot
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
light
maltiness
to
it
along
with
a
mild
addition
of
citrousy
aroma
hops
it
seems
to
be
a
bit
dry
and
refreshing
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
nice
pale
malt
core
along
with
a
super
bitter
hop
bite
it
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
ipa
it
is
a
bitter
tasting
brew
with
a
nice
hop
aroma
one
of
the
beers
that
i
keep
coming
back
to
due
to
my
affinity
for
ipas
and
its
reasonable
price
very
hoppy
as
an
ipa
should
be
somewhat
on
the
bitter
side
yet
goes
down
smooth
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
malty
head
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
its
there
nonetheless
goes
well
with
a
good
steak
or
hamburger
overall
a
delicious
ipa
comparable
to
a
sn
pale
ale
harpoon
ipa
is
a
definite
purchase
from
the
tap
into
a
bright
and
rich
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
resulting
in
a
decent
lacing
subtle
smells
of
hops
almost
imaginary
full
body
for
the
style
tastes
fairly
standard
seems
to
have
just
enough
hops
to
qualify
and
impart
the
proper
bitterness
but
there
just
isnt
enough
mouth
action
for
what
i
expect
from
an
ipa
could
stand
to
use
more
hops
or
something
to
cause
that
nice
tingly
sensation
not
too
much
character
here
but
surprisingly
clean
in
the
end
mostly
par
for
the
course
but
good
drinkability
because
of
it
poured
ambergold
with
a
white
head
sharp
bitter
hops
in
the
aroma
a
bit
of
fruitiness
decent
mouthful
taste
is
a
nice
hopmalt
balance
good
bitterness
in
the
finish
not
sure
id
call
this
an
ipa
but
it
was
certainly
a
tasty
beer
went
down
quite
nicely
would
make
a
nice
session
brew
nice
and
fresh
from
the
tap
im
interested
in
seeing
if
the
bottle
version
holds
up
oelergud
what
says
boston
better
than
a
harpoon
i
had
to
send
my
first
pint
back
because
the
bartender
put
a
lemon
in
it
never
understood
that
it
is
a
light
amber
in
color
with
a
quick
receding
head
and
eversoslight
lace
not
as
bitter
as
most
ipas
the
hop
flavor
is
slightly
stronger
than
most
ipas
instead
this
beer
helped
me
get
through
college
so
i
may
be
a
bit
onesided
editsince
trying
this
beer
for
the
first
time
about
4
months
ago
i
have
grown
a
fondness
for
this
beer
and
consider
it
if
not
the
best
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
available
almost
anywhere
ontap
in
the
boston
area
i
usually
find
myself
drinking
one
of
these
at
some
point
throughout
the
night
excellent
beer
that
i
have
most
certainly
grown
to
love
original
review
110102
a
fine
ipa
and
one
of
the
most
balanced
ipas
ive
tried
while
hoppy
it
doesnt
have
that
onesided
hoppiness
of
most
ipas
it
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
that
lets
the
malt
shine
through
as
well
i
swear
i
detected
the
taste
of
cloves
similar
to
a
hefeweizen
which
only
added
to
my
enjoyment
a
fine
beer
i
wish
it
were
distributed
here
in
the
midwest
deep
amber
and
smelling
of
hops
when
poured
its
been
quite
some
time
since
i
last
had
any
harpoon
im
glad
to
have
this
opportunity
once
again
hops
dominated
the
aroma
but
subtle
undertones
of
lemon
came
through
nice
tangy
bite
when
drank
smoothed
out
to
a
nice
small
molasses
finish
this
is
a
really
good
ipa
above
average
the
hops
and
malt
play
very
well
together
in
this
a
classic
american
ipa
that
pours
a
deep
golden
or
copper
color
with
a
large
white
head
lacing
is
minimal
however
the
aroma
is
predominantly
citrusy
hops
with
a
malty
undertone
the
taste
is
classic
hops
with
citrusy
tinge
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
smooth
carbonation
and
a
slight
alcohol
hit
at
the
end
it
has
a
crisp
moderate
body
this
is
a
real
drinkable
beer
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
and
through
several
more
there
are
hoppier
ales
that
i
like
more
but
this
is
one
is
above
average
the
flavor
of
this
beer
was
very
smooth
flavored
ipa
strangely
smooth
the
bitters
were
there
but
there
was
no
bite
ipas
should
bite
you
especially
when
the
waitress
recommends
it
to
you
when
they
are
out
of
dogfish
head
90
min
ipas
easily
accessable
in
the
new
england
area
and
beyond
and
reasonalbly
priced
for
such
a
well
crafted
beer
tastes
best
out
of
a
growler
fresh
from
the
brewery
in
boston
massachusetts
definitely
a
nice
brew
and
a
quality
ipa
pale
clear
golden
color
with
off
white
head
that
crowned
to
about
two
inches
tall
floral
hop
aroma
is
gentle
yet
strong
delicate
pine
resin
hoppyness
with
an
assertive
spicy
bitterness
hints
of
butterscotch
and
grapefruit
on
the
palette
back
the
hops
up
nicely
medium
to
thin
creamy
body
very
drinkable
dont
worry
about
what
you
might
have
read
about
this
beer
on
some
other
site
this
is
a
pretty
good
ipa
this
was
a
very
solid
and
enjoyable
ipa
poured
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
wispy
off
white
head
nice
lacing
sticking
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
of
hops
and
citrus
fruit
the
taste
was
lighter
than
i
expected
and
not
too
bitter
but
the
fruit
taste
was
very
well
balanced
and
not
as
obtrusive
as
some
other
ipas
ive
had
there
was
not
much
of
a
malt
backbone
but
overall
i
welcomed
the
lighter
side
of
this
ipa
very
enjoyable
spring
time
drink
with
a
decent
abv
and
very
drinkable
i
believe
i
can
find
this
brew
in
most
stores
on
the
east
coast
so
this
will
be
added
to
the
list
as
a
nice
quick
on
the
road
brew
the
feel
was
very
good
with
nice
clean
crispness
in
the
ending
overall
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
americanstyle
ipa
the
big
plus
of
the
beer
is
its
really
good
malt
profile
this
made
this
an
exceptional
beer
ive
purposely
not
read
the
other
reviews
and
i
assume
most
will
say
not
enough
hops
this
is
hoppy
but
definitely
could
use
more
hops
as
an
ipa
very
good
though
you
can
find
this
all
around
town
which
is
a
nice
thing
to
say
about
boston
overall
a
very
good
beer
of
the
style
i
think
this
is
what
i
expected
the
sweetwater
ipa
to
be
like
when
i
reviewed
it
last
week
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
the
beer
could
be
more
bitter
and
have
a
more
pronounced
hop
character

malt
has
a
hard
time
generating
a
presence
before
a
slightly
oily
bittering
kicks
in
hops
start
well
but
not
as
big
as
many
and
are
helped
by
the
aroma
qualities
the
finishing
aspects
are
slightly
metallic
and
the
mouthfeel
turns
a
little
watery
at
the
same
time
not
bad
at
least
its
not
one
of
those
hop
cartoons
ipa
that
are
flooding
the
market
malt
and
finish
could
be
better
thanks
to
liza
p
and
her
dad
for
getting
it
and
ken
k
for
bringing
it
back
the
taste
was
hoppy
yet
well
balanced
with
caramel
malt
not
bad
but
not
great
there
are
much
better
ipas
out
there
it
was
smooth
and
i
will
drink
it
again
i
just
liked
it
better
on
tap
overall
this
is
a
good
ipa
with
plenty
of
hop
flavor
on
draught
at
lazy
chameleon
pours
a
clear

with
a

decent

as
well
the
aroma
is
a
really
pleasant
concoction
of
hops
and
fruit
mediumbodied
and
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
subdued
given
the
strong
aroma
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
malt
in
the
flavor
as
well
the
finish
is
fairly
clean
and
bitter
maybe
it
is
the
hopheavy
ipas
like
ruination
buckeye
76
et
al
that
are
to
blame
but
i
like
a
higher
level
of
hops
than
this
beer
offers
both
in
the
flavor
and
in
the
finish
a
decent
beer
nonetheless
this
was
from
a
12
bottle
sampler
box
that
arrived
at
lexington
kentuckys
liquor
barn
stores
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
so
it
should
be
reasonably
fresh
pours
out
a
medium
gold
with
an
average
head
and
moderate
lacing
floral
hop
aroma
is
pleasant
but
doesnt
knock
you
back
like
many
american
ipas
mouthfeel
is
just
about
right
medium
carbonation
and
dry
hops
balanced
perfectly
with
the
malt
taste
is
basically
the
same
impressive
balance
with
notes
of
pink
grapefruit
and
lemon
this
is
not
an
exciting
or
big
ipa
but
it
is
definitely
a
very
well
crafted
if
toned
down
american
style
pale
ale
im
impressed
with
its
overall
likeabilty
pours
a
dark
goldenlight
amber
with
a
large
cloudy
white
head
lacing
is
superb
in
its
sheeting
and
strength
aroma
is
mostly
strong
floral
hops
with
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
holding
it
together
flavor
is
slightly
malty
up
front
with
a
big
juicy
hop
finish
that
dominates
the
palate
and
lasts
for
a
while
medium
bodied
extremely
drinkable
seems
to
have
gotten
a
little
weaker
over
the
past
couple
of
years
more
of
a
pale
ale
than
an
ipa
now
it
also
hasnt
ever
been
as
good
on
tap
as
in
the
bottle
i
used
to
buy
the
bottles
quite
often
id
go
more
with
stone
or
hopdevil
now
i
was
lucky
enough
to
try
this
on
tap
at
buckowskis
while
in
town
for
the
stammtisch
festival
it
poured
a
burnt
golden
colour
not
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
to
be
had
the
tiny
head
left
its
mark
down
the
glass
as
it
was
devoured
understated
floral
scents
on
the
nose
the
initial
port
like
sweetness
mellowed
as
the
hops
gently
let
themselves
be
known
i
feel
this
ale
more
closely
resembles
a
british
ipa
than
a
typical
american
ipa
not
spectacular
but
very
drinkable
yummy
i
decided
to
pour
this
along
side
a
tyranenna
ipa
it
pales
in
comparison
in
regards
to
hops
on
the
nose
and
the
buds
the
tyranena
rocks
huge
citrus
invade
at
first
pour
this
one
is
different
but
good
in
its
own
way
the
hops
and
malt
are
very
balanced
almost
even
it
is
highly
drinkable
i
see
the
hopping
as
more
of
a
sweter
floral
style
than
a
tight
citrus
flavor
i
like
it
good
in
a
lot
of
ways
and
i
like
the
sweeter
mouthfeel
as
a
changeup
ipa
almost
more
of
an
apa
like
summit
extra
pale
ale
rather
than
a
full
fledged
ipa
this
is
a
beer
for
long
sessions
very
yellow
in
color
compared
to
most
ipas
aroma
is
big
on
the
floral
and
citrus
character
my
guess
is
from
a
healthy
dryhopping
taste
is
kind
of
like
budweiser
with
a
ton
of
cascades
added
to
it
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
it
tastes
wellmade
with
a
beatiful
balance
to
it
that
fades
evenly
the
only
real
malt
character
to
speak
of
is
a
little
breadiness
and
graininess
the
feel
is
a
little
thin
and
fizzy
i
felt
like
i
could
have
drank
about
ten
of
these
in
a
row
pleasing
in
flavor
yet
light
and
drinkable
i
have
had
this
beer
on
tap
and
it
is
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
bottled
version
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
and
it
just
may
become
a
regular
bottled
beer
for
me
poured
out
a
copper
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
lingers
around
for
quite
a
bit
aroma
was
straight
up
hops
although
not
powerful
but
noticeable
taste
was
hoppy
with
a
malt
backround
fairly
balanced
out
this
was
rather
smooth
and
pretty
good
this
seems
to
be
more
of
a
pale
ale
than
an
ipa
still
not
a
bad
beer
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
more
of
these
in
the
future
pours
a
bright
golden
color
a
little
lighter
than
other
ipas
i
have
tried
this
looks
almost
like
a
pilsner
the
head
was
medium
sized
with
medium
retention
wilted
down
to
a
thin
film
that
stayed
for
the
remainder
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
good
a
full
spicy
floral
hop
bouquet
with
lemonycitrus
note
the
taste
is
also
very
good
started
off
mellow
and
sweet
and
blended
into
a
crisp
citric
hoppiness
that
left
me
smacking
my
lips
mouthfeel
was
full
bodied
smooth
and
semidry
good
allround
ipa
on
rereview
it
seems
that
harpoon
has
dumbed
this
down
for
the
masses
with
a
much
more
watery
taste
and
diminished
hoppiness
not
the
classic
it
once
was
surprisingly
weak
for
some
reason
i
expected
good
things
of
harpoon
maybe
its
just
my
west
coast
enchantment
will
all
things
eastern
but
this
beer
was
just
blah
poured
clear
gold
in
color
with
rather
little
carbonation
and
not
much
of
a
head
to
speak
of
at
all
aroma
contained
very
little
malt
and
only
a
muted
leafygrapefruity
hop
boquet
this
grapefruit
taste
comes
off
in
the
flavor
as
something
more
like
grapejuice
sweet
without
any
significant
hop
bite
not
much
of
a
malt
body
either
its
drinkable
but
so
is
water
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
dense
and
creamlike
head
buttery
and
crisp
is
an
accurate
way
to
describe
this
beer
dry
and
oily
with
a
slight
oily
aftertaste
alcohol
presence
with
a
bit
of
citrus
tang
well
rounded
body
and
full
of
flavor
nice
ipa
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
and
i
never
remember
it
being
this
good
i
never
had
it
on
tap
and
its
far
superior
to
the
bottled
version
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
decent
enough
white
head
with
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
fairly
decent
with
a
decent
hop
aroma
fairly
good
hop
bite
with
a
little
maltiness
to
the
taste
it
is
a
bit
thin
in
the
body
department
pretty
decent
beer
although
it
could
have
a
bit
more
hoppiness
to
it
not
too
terribly
different
from
the
draught
version
ok
its
ipa
time
pours
a
nice
golden
color
creamy
sticky
lofty
head
smells
very
nice
of
cascade
hops
very
brisk
in
aroma
taste
is
dominated
by
the
hop
flavors
not
too
strong
though
quite
pleasant
actually
and
very
drinkable
balanced
by
some
malts
biscuit
and
bread
flavored
malts
that
is
hop
flavors
are
distinctly
of
juniper
and
pine
my
belches
really
bring
out
the
juniper
flavors
a
solid
ipa
pours
golden
in
color
with
a
slight
haze
cascade
hops
are
immediately
apperrant
in
the
aroma
taste
is
citrusy
some
malt
in
the
taste
as
well
but
it
doesnt
take
away
from
the
hoppiness
of
this
ipa
basically
just
a
solid
ipa
it
has
enough
bitterness
to
satisfy
the
hopheads
but
doesnt
try
to
show
off
with
an
insane
amount
of
hops
this
beer
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
a
moderate
head
and
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
some
fruits
in
it
and
some
spices
as
well
the
taste
was
fairly
smooth
but
not
very
hoppy
the
carbonation
is
evident
in
the
flavor
decent
beer
but
a
not
quite
smooth
enough
for
my
tastes
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
good
head
retention
and
lots
of
lace
left
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
full
of
pine
and
citrus
just
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
full
of
fruity
esters
but
the
hops
might
be
a
little
low
for
an
ipa
still
it
is
a
very
nice
smooth
taste
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
the
body
was
just
a
little
light
and
oily
the
drinkability
is
superb
though
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
more
from
this
brewery
on
tap
at
the
brewery
this
was
my
favorite
draught
beer
when
i
last
lived
in
boston
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
impact
it
once
did
for
me
but
a
solid
ipa
still
fresh
as
can
be
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
decent
head
to
it
aroma
is
primarily
cascade
with
a
slight
citrus
medium
bodied
witha
nice
balance
and
a
slight
bitter
finish
quite
enjoyable
pours
a
nice
medium
gold
color
with
a
medium
head
that
leaves
some
lacingaroma
is
assertively
hoppy
and
zesty
the
taste
is
hoppy
for
sure
but
there
is
a
sweet
balance
there
in
the
finish
i
think
this
an
above
average
ipa
that
is
very
drinkable
and
goes
good
with
spicey
food
hoppy
hoppy
hoppy
if
you
like
a
nice
balanced
but
hoppy
ipa
this
is
a
classic
style
little
malt
to
round
off
this
ale
which
is
more
like
a
west
coast
version
floral
nose
and
hoppy
throughout
it
is
thirst
quenching
and
refreshing
excellent
belgian
lace
throughout
and
very
drinkable
on
a
warm
day
overall
impression
not
a
monstrous
ipa
but
definitely
not
wimpy
either
solid
and
well
crafted
the
balance
was
superb
as
was
the
drinkability
moderately
complex
character
keeps
you
interested
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nice
label
pours
a
dark
golden
and
slightly
reddis
color
the
appearance
reminded
me
of
some
of
the
better
macro
canadian
ales
because
of
the
darker
golden
color
and
clarity
the
aroma
is
of
floral
hops
and
the
taste
is
consistent
with
the
aroma
this
is
a
straight
floral
hop
beer
if
you
like
that
type
of
hops
youll
love
this
beer
appears
a
golden
copper
tone
with
an
off
white
mother
of
pearl
tinted
creamy
full
head
while
leaving
some
nice
residual
lacing
the
aroma
is
slightly
citric
but
predominantly
a
nice
floral
hop
aroma
with
a
good
bit
of
malt
sweetness
balancing
out
the
over
scent
of
this
beer
cant
say
the
aroma
is
amazingly
memorable
but
i
can
say
this
is
a
nice
pleasant
go
to
at
this
point
very
solid
brew
the
taste
flavor
is
a
mellow
creamy
balance
of
malty
goodness
blended
with
a
floral
bitter
hop
profile
i
can
tell
that
this
beer
is
a
little
dumbed
down
from
the
guidelines
of
a
typical
ipa
not
getting
the
hop
satisfaction
that
any
true
hophead
is
yearning
for
like
i
said
not
a
failure
but
not
a
favorite
at
the
same
time
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
a
nice
chewy
texture
to
it
not
thick
and
cloying
chewy
just
some
pleasant
and
welcoming
body
to
this
beer
overall
what
can
i
say
no
off
flavors
maybe
lack
of
some
hop
bitterness
but
overall
a
dangerously
drinkable
well
made
beer
in
my
book
this
beer
poured
an
amber
color
and
formed
a
white
foamy
head
that
receded
slowly
and
left
some
nice
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
a
nice
hop
aroma
was
apparent
but
not
overpowering
as
some
others
are
a
flavor
of
hops
and
caramel
the
finish
was
a
touch
sweet
with
some
bitterness
this
wasnt
a
bad
ipa
but
certainly
not
one
of
my
favorites
ah
the
summer
months
bring
me
such
joy
with
the
abundence
of
hops
harpoon
reminds
me
of
labor
day
when
my
parents
and
their
friends
would
gather
and
one
of
them
always
brough
a
sixer
of
red
hook
and
a
sixer
of
harpoon
the
ipa
poured
a
hazy
summer
yellow
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
had
real
staying
power
great
head
retention
the
smell
was
very
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
little
hint
of
medicinal
hops
the
taste
was
refreshing
and
dry
but
lacked
the
real
hop
punch
i
look
for
in
an
ipa
tart
hops
tickled
the
front
of
my
tongue
and
then
morphed
into
deep
roasted
malts
fighting
with
peachy
sweet
hops
and
ended
with
a
bitter
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
very
buttery
this
is
a
good
standby
but
nothing
exceptional
perfect
summer
beer
poured
a
light
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
nice
carbonation
throughout
floral
hops
in
the
aroma
and
really
not
much
else
nice
hoppy
taste
thats
not
overpowering
but
leaves
a
nice
zing
on
the
tongue
finishing
dry
like
other
harpoon
beers
ive
had
this
beer
has
a
hint
pumpkin
pie
in
the
taste
thats
good
unique
and
really
noticeable
in
the
winter
warmer
this
a
good
ipa
nothing
too
special
but
good
overall
body
is
golden
colored
with
strong
elements
of
orange
hues
aroma
is
moderate
in
strength
and
largely
comprised
of
floral
and
citrus
notes
flavor
has
an
odd
malt
bite
which
creates
a
good
balance
with
the
brews
moderate
hop
profile
for
an
ipa
body
is
moderate
and
head
leaves
a
strong
lace
a
good
ipa
no
surprises
here
had
soft
citrus
hops
and
malt
throughout
finished
with
a
toasted
biscuit
with
a
mild
bitterness
that
finishes
nicely
great
ipa
and
a
wonderful
beer
pale
amber
in
appearance
silky
smooth
offwhite
lace
coats
the
glass
aromas
are
much
softer
than
the
bottled
version
a
slight
citrus
and
earthy
mix
the
taste
is
so
very
smooth
given
that
this
is
my
first
caskconditioned
beer
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
man
was
i
impressed
when
id
originally
reviewed
this
beer
i
noted
how
wellbalanced
it
was
from
a
hoppy
bitternessmalty
sweetness
ratio
the
very
same
holds
true
with
this
version
of
the
ipa
everything
just
seems
to
have
been
toned
down
and
mellowed
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
fantastic
the
differences
in
this
beer
from
the
cask
and
bottle
are
striking
a
great
way
to
start
off
the
aobf
a
solid
inch
or
more
of
bright
white
foam
rests
gently
atop
a
slightly
hazy
goldenamber
body
the
head
retention
is
good
and
some
very
nice
lace
is
left
throughout
the
entire
glass
bright
fresh
and
floral
hops
greet
you
in
the
nose
as
soon
as
its
poured
very
nice
a
medium
body
combines
with
a
very
finebubbled
carbonation
to
leave
it
lightly
crisp
on
the
tongue
floral
hops
and
a
sweet
grainy
malt
swirl
in
a
kaleidescope
of
flavor
right
off
the
bat
rich
exciting
sweet
hoppy
fruity
and
finally
bitter
in
the
lingering
drying
finish
its
exceptionally
wellbalanced
with
a
bitterness
that
reveals
itself
increasingly
with
every
sip
what
finesse
pours
a
fairly
light
pilsner
color
topped
with
an
orangey
foamy
head
there
is
a
light
hop
aroma
and
an
initial
flavor
also
of
light
hop
flavor
is
also
tinged
with
pine
and
citrus
for
an
ipa
i
would
have
expected
the
hop
to
be
stronger
but
it
is
even
and
well
balanced
with
other
flavors
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
crisp
solid
ipa
pours
yelloworange
with
a
good
head
sturdy
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
level
of
hoppiness
finishes
a
bit
too
bitter
for
my
taste
but
rather
well
balanced
overall
perhaps
its
best
quality
is
its
readyavailability
almost
everywhere
in
the
northeast
these
days
happy
drinking
i
must
note
prior
to
the
review
that
the
bottle
i
got
is
about
seven
months
old
pours
a
pale
orange
someone
described
it
as
apricot
id
say
thats
right
with
a
sticky
white
head
earthy
citric
hope
head
with
some
malt
towards
the
end
very
vibrant
smell
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
by
the
taste
while
the
nose
was
very
nice
the
taste
was
just
soso
and
kind
of
boring
there
is
hop
bitterness
but
much
less
than
i
expected
malty
biscuity
taste
this
beer
warms
a
bit
which
is
always
nice
mediumbodied
and
crisp
id
say
this
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
it
might
be
a
nice
beer
for
those
uninitiated
in
the
world
of
ipas
just
so
they
can
start
to
get
their
feet
wet
i
do
thank
uglyradio
for
sending
it
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
clingy
off
white
moderate
sized
head
the
mouthfeel
is
closer
to
moderate
than
thin
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
and
citrus
the
taste
is
of
bread
like
malt
with
a
grapefruit
hoppiness
and
a
lingering
herbal
quality
this
beer
seems
to
me
to
be
more
along
the
lines
of
an
english
ipa
in
that
it
is
more
balanced
but
using
an
american
style
hops
to
give
a
citrusy
flavor
pretty
drinkable
this
isnt
a
serious
ipa
more
like
something
a
macro
drinker
would
try
when
they
want
to
be
adventurous
it
could
be
rescued
by
a
chunkier
mouthfeel
and
more
hops
in
its
current
incarnation
i
wont
be
revisiting
this
smell
is
citrusy
with
some
hops
aroma
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
hops
up
front
and
tons
of
lemon
at
the
end
very
very
lemony
when
i
had
it
on
tap
i
dont
think
that
aspect
is
as
prevalent
when
had
in
bottles
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
crisp
average
drinkability
not
a
topnotch
beer
but
a
decent
ipa
that
delivers
some
hops
and
is
pretty
tasty
much
better
on
tap
imho
the
harpoon
ipa
seems
to
be
imitating
the
ipa
style
rather
than
letting
loose
and
creating
their
own
representation
orange
pekoe
in
color
the
medium
malt
is
a
little
grainy
this
highly
hopped
brew
is
uninspired
some
citrus
bitterness
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
smooth
for
the
ipa
and
too
easy
to
drink
should
be
sharp
edged
and
boldly
bitter
nice
mix
this
is
a
very
consistent
thirstquenching
reliable
beer
it
could
be
a
bit
sharper
but
of
course
im
a
bit
of
a
hophead
it
could
have
more
depth
more
complexity
a
bit
more
malt
to
play
with
the
hops
but
it
is
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
and
seems
well
puttogether
on
tap
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
brew
color
was
pale
with
a
nice
white
head
my
favorite
part
of
the
beer
not
really
drinking
it
is
the
best
was
the
aroma
it
was
a
nice
combination
of
fruity
and
hop
like
smells
that
reminded
me
of
spring
a
nice
flavored
beer
as
well
with
a
strong
hop
presence
that
i
expect
from
an
ipa
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
with
or
without
food
a
good
beer
and
at
a
good
price
when
compared
to
other
micros
harpoon
is
not
the
best
ipa
but
its
a
worthy
brew
and
ill
buy
it
again
i
may
like
this
brew
better
from
the
bottle
im
not
sure
pours
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
great
head
goes
down
almost
as
smooth
as
on
tap
very
very
drinkable
brew
i
love
the
fact
that
this
brew
is
everywhere
around
boston
its
nice
to
live
in
a
city
where
a
nice
micro
can
be
bought
where
ever
you
go
not
a
wonderful
ipa
but
youll
be
able
to
put
them
away
i
certainly
do
not
dislike
this
ale
but
there
are
better

upon
another
review
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
watery
one
of
my
favourites
especially
when
i
can
get
it
with
a
month
old
or
less
bottled
on
date
nothing
like
fresh
harpoon
ipa
oddly
i
like
this
brew
better
in
the
bottle
than
on
tap
a
pretty
good
brew
overall
copper
colored
with
a
clear
look
thin
off
white
head
and
no
lacing
smells
hoppy
and
citrusy
with
a
bit
of
spice
i
think
not
a
very
hoppy
ipa
and
when
i
drink
this
style
i
really
prefer
a
big
hop
kick
however
the
more
balanced
flavor
of
this
beer
was
pleasant
very
drinkable
and
smooth
a
very
good
brew
from
harpoon
this
pours
a
nice
dark
redcopper
colour
with
a
little
head
that
is
gone
very
quickly
i
have
noticed
that
most
harpoon
beers
dont
have
too
much
of
a
head
retention
to
them
oh
well
this
smells
very
hoppy
like
an
ipa
should
and
it
goes
down
very
crisp
on
the
tongue
this
beer
has
a
very
balanced
flavor
the
interplay
of
the
hops
and
the
malts
is
great
but
unlike
the
ale
the
hops
really
stand
out
on
this
one
this
has
a
crisp
mouthfeel
and
a
high
drinkability
factor
as
well
this
is
a
great
summer
evening
brew
that
will
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
great
on
the
pour
the
beers
appears
a
deeply
tanned
gold
with
a
sparkling
white
head
that
is
impressive
in
size
frothy
in
its
texture
and
as
it
erodes
it
leaves
a
nice
lace
coving
lightly
floral
hints
of
malt
with
a
citrus
crispness
and
quite
a
treat
for
the
nose
sweet
at
the
front
with
a
middling
top
and
a
biting
acidity
at
the
finish
with
an
english
hop
spicy
bite
not
brutal
just
quite
pleasant
to
the
palate
also
quite
dry
and
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
this
beer
lovers
book
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
gold
color
the
head
was
foamy
white
head
that
left
fairly
fast
but
the
skim
that
it
left
was
able
to
leave
some
lace
the
aroma
was
of
citrus
hops
and
citrus
hops
the
taste
was
not
too
heavy
on
the
hops
but
they
were
present
but
they
shared
it
with
the
citrus
some
malt
seemed
to
be
present
at
the
back
of
the
taste
but
it
faded
quick
pretty
good
for
this
style
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
starter
for
a
beginning
ipa
drinker
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
with
a
pleasant
copper
color
nothing
fancy
here
just
a
good
clean
consistent
ale
this
is
my
everyday
always
on
hand
ale
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
and
readily
available
on
the
east
coast
crystal
clear
golden
yellow
beer
with
a
nice
head
of
pure
white
foam
that
leaves
a
good
bit
of
lace
aroma
is
full
of
hops
with
floral
and
grapfruity
citrus
notes
dominating
flavor
was
light
hop
bitterness
with
a
big
dose
of
citrus
hoppiness
being
right
up
front
flavor
fades
through
some
sweet
malt
before
a
very
fast
dry
finish
ok
beer
for
the
style
and
at
least
it
isnt
one
of
those
all
hops
all
the
time
super
beers
my
first
ipa
i
decided
to
revisit
it
just
the
right
blend
of
hops
not
too
overpowering
make
this
copper
colored
beverage
just
right
easy
drinking
it
can
be
a
good
game
time
beer
glad
i
tried
it
again
a
pleasant
suprise
from
harpoon
a
rich
copper
color
with
a
creamy
head
in
the
middle
for
taste
but
a
good
dry
finish
goes
down
very
easilya
nice
ipa
to
share
with
crossovers
harpoons
ipa
looks
like
your
standard
issue
american
ipa
its
medium
copper
in
color
and
possesses
a
sticky
clinging
head
that
leaves
substantial
lace
throughout
the
glass
the
nose
is
predominantly
hoppy
with
a
definite
floral
aspect
it
tastes
quite
hoppy
with
a
decent
malt
backbone
however
for
this
style
my
tastes
require
more
hops
and
more
malt
mouthfeel
is
rather
prickly
and
clean
its
easy
to
have
more
than
a
few
of
these
making
this
a
good
choice
for
a
session
beer
its
certainly
worth
a
try
although
some
ipas
have
failed
me
this
one
was
pretty
good
hoppy
but
not
to
the
extreme
i
will
say
that
this
beer
had
a
very
intense
flavor
and
mouthfeel
it
had
some
kick
with
a
nip
on
your
tongue
that
you
could
never
forget
harpoon
seems
to
do
that
and
i
find
it
unique
it
is
a
great
new
experiece
to
have
a
harpoon
mmmm
i
have
never
gone
wrong
with
an
ipa
and
this
is
no
exception
beautiful
fluffy
head
that
stood
well
over
the
top
of
my
glass
copper
color
very
nice
hop
flavor
not
that
strong
but
you
certainly
cant
miss
it
sticky
lace
all
the
way
down
extremely
smooth
and
an
excellent
mouthfeel
smooth
and
buttery
a
great
ipa
quite
the
easy
drinking
tap
offering
a
toasty
malt
spine
holding
up
a
well
hopped
bitterness
aroma
and
flavor
one
could
drink
this
all
night
but
the
abv
might
have
something
to
say
about
that
after
a
half
dozen
dark
golden
hue
w
a
light
ale
haze
pungent
dry
hopped
cascade
hop
nose
not
unlike
fresh
liberty
ale
dominates
but
a
bit
of
generic
caramel
sweetness
is
there
in
aroma
also
although
hop
bitterness
dominates
yeast
fruitiness
toasty
malt
are
perceptible
light
in
body
but
crisp
and
quite
drinkable
the
hop
flavor
is
expctedly
citrus
finishes
clean
and
bit
dry
a
bit
understated
in
malt
for
an
aipa
and
perhaps
one
dimensional
but
nonetheless
is
an
enjoyable
brew
with
a
bigger
malt
backbone
this
would
be
excellent
its
reminscent
of
a
thin
anchor
liberty
with
more
hop
bitterness
a
good
ipa
but
not
my
style
serious
hops
from
start
to
finish
clear
good
head
heavy
hop
aroma
medium
body
and
fairly
dry
strong
bitter
finish
slightly
musty
hop
smell
with
a
hint
of
citrus
very
light
color
with
a
slight
amber
hue
it
has
a
lasting
white
head
it
is
very
very
carbonated
crisp
hop
flavor
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
it
is
very
clean
almost
too
clean
but
is
quite
drinkable
for
an
ipa
due
to
this
fact
the
mouth
is
left
very
dry
after
tasting
a
very
tasty
ipa
it
is
a
clean
and
bitter
brew
with
a
dry
hop
flower
finish
very
sturdy
one
of
the
bestbalanced
ipas
particularly
for
an
american
style
up
front
this
is
moderately
sweet
with
a
little
resin
in
the
hops
the
hops
bittering
in
the
finish
is
lingering
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
very
drinkable
and
one
of
the
few
ipas
that
i
would
designate
as
having
session
potential
my
favorite
beer
for
everyday
enjoyment
and
especially
beautiful
and
tastey
on
tap
this
is
everything
that
harpoon
ipa
is
with
a
deep
golden
colour
with
a
supercreamy
offwhite
head
with
tremendous
retention
big
rings
and
full
coverage
across
the
top
nice
dry
and
balanced
slightly
biting
medium
body
with
covert
but
full
malts
and
complex
and
striking
hops
drinks
great
for
any
occasion
or
situation
cheers
a
very
well
rounded
ipa
from
one
of
my
fav
breweries
but
as
one
earlier
post
stated
after
trying
others
such
as
pyramid
and
sweetwater
for
me
it
had
alot
to
live
up
to
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
there
are
other
ipas
much
better
in
my
opinion
cheers
pours
a
nice
light
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
has
some
decent
lacing
qualities
nice
pungent
oily
aroma
the
hop
explosion
hit
the
palate
first
and
it
is
good
i
would
say
this
beer
is
more
hoppy
than
it
is
bitter
there
is
a
bitter
element
present
but
more
of
the
hoppy
tones
seem
to
make
their
way
to
my
taste
sensors
flowery
and
herbal
at
the
same
time
a
bit
oily
slightly
pungent
after
cutting
through
all
of
the
wonderful
hop
nuances
you
will
find
a
decent
malt
presence
nicely
done
ipa
here
all
in
all
a
decent
ipa
after
having
tried
pyramid
and
lost
coast
though
the
bar
may
be
a
bit
too
high
the
color
was
a
nice
copper
and
there
was
a
moderate
hoppy
aroma
intertwined
with
some
fruit
and
spice
tinges
the
first
sip
is
slightly
disappointing
as
one
tends
to
expect
more
bang
for
the
buck
as
you
get
to
the
middle
of
the
bottle
and
towards
the
end
of
it
this
ipa
tends
to
grow
on
you
a
bit
not
the
best
but
not
terrible
by
far
had
my
first
one
of
these
tonight
its
a
nice
beer
and
from
what
ive
read
a
pretty
consistent
one
which
is
a
good
thing
just
a
few
shades
lighter
than
amber
in
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
fades
rather
quickly
the
aroma
has
me
befuddled
i
can
hardly
smell
anything
allergies
maybe
taste
is
more
pronounced
though
almost
english
in
style
the
hops
are
not
overthetop
but
theyre
there
nice
mild
citrus
and
a
touch
of
pine
smooth
malt
character
provides
a
pleasant
balance
and
leads
to
a
smooth
creamy
finish
not
a
standout
necessarily
this
is
probably
one
of
those
beers
that
grows
on
you
the
more
you
drink
it
so
im
looking
forward
to
trying
a
few
more
big
bubbly
white
head
over
golden
body
nice
lacing
big
hop
aromas
lot
of
citrus
much
more
balanced
in
taste
than
nose
would
indicate
more
english
than
american
ipa
except
for
the
aroma
which
makes
it
more
of
a
session
beer
for
hopheads
some
postingsreviews
seem
to
indicate
that
it
has
been
dumbeddown
but
this
is
still
a
fine
beer
glad
they
still
send
large
quanitites
to
new
jersey
pours
a
clear
bright
golden
color
with
a
thick
bubbly
white
head
smell
is
all
hops
and
hop
oil
some
slight
citrus
and
very
floral
qualities
floral
hops
explode
onto
the
tongue
but
are
then
followed
by
some
nice
balancing
malt
brew
gets
maltier
as
it
warms
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
and
extremely
drinkable
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
major
fallback
brews
when
i
am
home
in
ma
recently
it
has
become
very
easy
to
get
down
here
in
va
no
complaints
from
me
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
session
brews
slightly
sour
aroma
pours
to
tempting
head
golden
color
light
for
ipa
good
hop
character
floral
bitter
stringy
hops
are
what
make
the
beer
light
fruity
malts
are
understated
pretty
mild
character
overall
despite
hop
presence
absolutely
fresh
it
can
be
quite
good
but
if
its
more
than
a
couple
weeks
old
itll
be
closer
to
average
this
is
the
local
hopmeister
a
deep
rich
amber
color
with
a
medium
body
and
lasting
thick
head
give
this
beer
a
good
look
nice
heavy
hop
aroma
and
powerful
yet
mellow
hop
flavor
profile
nice
balance
of
malts
with
this
one
create
an
easy
drinking
libation
it
certainly
does
assault
you
on
first
whiff
and
taste
had
it
last
night
for
the
first
time
and
ended
up
carrying
out
the
box
this
morning
not
that
i
was
responsible
for
the
whole
thing
hoppy
as
sin
kinda
bready
and
skanky
on
the
nose
didnt
hold
a
held
but
plenty
of
carbonation
the
color
is
a
mediumcopper
w
a
small
head
which
dissipates
very
quickly
nice
floral
hoppiness
w
bite
on
the
mouth
excellent
finish
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
a
true
english
styled
ipa
56
updated
to
increase
taste
and
drinkability
after
a
trip
to
boston
where
i
had
this
fresh
at
the
brewery
this
is
much
better
when
fresh
and
overall
one
of
my
favorite
east
coast
session
ipas
very
well
balanced
bright
flavors
and
really
quaffable
very
pale
for
an
american
ipa
but
very
tasty
hops
everywhere
but
not
overwhelming
at
first
a
salty
green
rind
flavour
followed
by
a
rush
of
citrus
and
sweet
malt
this
beer
was
really
something
at
the
onset
of
the
craft
brew
movement
and
its
likely
converted
many
a
yellow
beer
drinker
its
still
very
good
beer
however
with
the
evolution
of
american
ipas
this
one
comes
up
a
little
short
maybe
thats
an
unfair
comparison
since
this
probably
is
closer
to
an
english
style
ipa
even
so
its
a
little
weak
a
pretty
decent
all
around
good
ipa
plenty
of
hops
and
malt
to
match
with
a
nice
alcohol
kick
unfortunately
its
seems
to
be
changing
year
after
year
getting
dumbed
down
for
the
masses
and
is
nothing
like
the
original
tod
mott
recipe
still
a
solid
favourite
of
mine
and
a
nice
backup
beer
