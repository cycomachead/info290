poured
handsomely
and
perfectly
clear
with
ambers
mahogany
and
a
burnt
orange
blush
tan
head
of
creamy
foam
that
lasted
well
nose
is
shy
and
subtle
but
clean
no
alcohol
a
demure
hint
of
dark
fruits
wait
elegantly
behind
a
rich
and
sweet
malt
taste
is
smooth
and
creamy
not
as
crisp
as
some
of
the
german
dopplebocks
but
this
malt
does
evolve
it
is
rich
and
has
a
bit
of
the
bread
crust
supple
smooth
and
medium
mouthfeel
finishes
softly
with
good
balance
and
begins
to
show
a
sweet
little
nuttiness
as
it
warms
dark
fruits
are
vague
but
substantial
enough
to
finish
this
one
with
a
light
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
overall
very
good
and
hearty
brew
tried
this
while
out
to
eat
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
it
is
a
little
lighter
to
me
at
least
than
some
of
the
german
dops
in
mouthfeel
even
though
the
abv
is
still
fairly
high
i
like
it
pours
a
reddishauburn
slightly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
caramel
a
malty
doughy
flavor
smooth
and
enjoyable
would
buy
it
again
good
flavor
nice
malt
foward
middle
but
thin
mouthfeel
just
under
par
for
this
style
i
get
a
funky
taste
from
this
beer
ebs
has
the
same
thing
i
do
not
like
it
so
hard
to
rate
beer
taking
the
after
taste
out
of
it
beer
has
other
good
qualities
absolutely
fantastic
and
a
cool
logo
to
boot
probably
would
not
get
this
again
even
if
i
could
find
a
bottle
with
a
recent
brew
date
the
apparent
content
of
adjunct
and
sweetness
level
did
bother
me
a
bit
i
would
pass
it
next
time
overall
a
pretty
fair
beer
i
think
this
would
go
good
with
pasta
and
the
next
time
i
am
at
an
italian
restaurant
that
carries
this
beer
i
will
give
it
another
try
o
pretty
good
not
up
to
german
standards
perhaps
but
drinkable
enough
looks
alright
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
sweet
malty
and
mildly
fruity
nice
body
possesses
a
subtle
but
rounded
character
that
goes
down
easily
worth
trying
if
you
come
across
it
pretty
decent
beer
kind
of
a
cross
between
a
brown
ale
lager
and
doppelbock
heavy
alcohol
burn
at
the
end
not
really
a
doppel
more
of
a
hybrid
deep
amber
color
malty
but
not
heavy
notes
of
caramel
maple
and
chocolate
very
similar
to
the
more
common
newcastle
but
better
overall
if
you
try
anything
from
moretti
heineken
you
should
try
this
and
you
might
just
be
surprised
this
is
a
quality
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
was
better
than
i
expected
and
actually
was
a
good
doppel
bock
i
loved
this
one
it
was
really
tasty
the
taste
was
so
smooth
and
lively
with
an
very
good
drinkability
for
the
style
no
alcohol
was
present
whatsoever
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
big
tan
head
smells
strongly
of
malt
the
taste
is
initially
a
very
sweet
caramelized
malt
flavor
then
a
touch
of
honey
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
decent
mouth
feel
overall
a
decent
doppelbock
though
id
prefer
a
bit
more
complexity
overall
good
beer
i
would
have
this
one
again
light
bodied
for
the
style
with
modest
carbonation
has
an
overly
sweet
aftertaste
i
like
a
good
doppelbock
but
this
one
is
far
from
good
will
avoid
in
the
future
overall
really
very
good
stuff
for
a
brewery
that
makes
their
dough
from
yet
another
pale
euro
lager
im
really
pleased
to
see
that
this
is
quite
widely
available
as
well
its
significantly
better
than
almost
anything
else
the
big
italian
breweries
seem
to
bring
out
o
i
cant
believe
this
was
dobblebock
it
was
closers
to
a
traditional
bock
with
a
higher
alcohol
content
many
great
german
versions
of
doppels
are
easily
available
try
one
of
them
over
this
one
this
is
an
easy
drinker
while
nothing
really
sticks
out
there
are
no
faults
with
this
beer
its
a
solid
example
of
the
style
overall
much
better
than
the
regular
lager
i
was
intrigued
when
i
saw
this
beer
as
i
am
a
fan
of
their
euro
lager
i
bought
this
for
about
9
99
a
sixer
which
i
think
it
is
well
worth
this
is
a
straight
up
malt
bomb
treat
and
a
perfect
beer
for
the
holidays
it
has
a
strong
dessert
beer
quality
best
enjoyed
in
short
but
frequent
occasions
amid
the
glittering
lights
and
trees
of
midwinter
much
more
than
i
expected
from
one
of
the
big
boys
of
italian
brewing
red
and
translucent
beer
with
a
quickly
vanishing
head
no
lacing
left
behind
on
the
glass
aroma
is
cold
steel
alcohol
and
cough
syrup
very
sweet
and
fruity
sickly
sweet
even
lots
of
banana
like
a
wheat
beer
thick
syrupy
in
the
mouth
too
much
for
me
buttery
even
finish
is
lots
of
sweetness
toomuchalcoholburn
and
a
weird
metallic
taste
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
in
color
with
a
1finger
tan
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
bit
some
spotting
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
but
not
much
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
dark
fruits
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
was
about
the
same
with
some
light
sweet
chocolate
nutty
finish
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
too
easy
a
great
brew
that
has
no
harsh
aftertaste
at
all
dark
brown
sweet
and
honey
scented
to
the
nose
little
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
layer
of
carbonation
little
to
no
lacing
its
sour
and
a
bit
boozy
to
the
tongue
i
feel
like
this
beer
could
do
so
much
more
with
its
flavor
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
at
all
it
goes
down
smooth
and
doesnt
leave
much
of
an
aftertaste
overall
this
beer
looks
a
lot
better
than
it
tastes
its
not
awful
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
this
again
one
of
the
sweetest
beers
ive
had
so
far
and
if
you
like
sweet
beers
you
should
definitely
seek
one
of
these
out
o
pretty
darn
surprisingly
good
it
would
stand
up
fine
against
your
random
no
name
german
version
better
and
truer
than
most
american
examples
o
hey
a
good
beer
cant
complain
about
that
the
taste
is
also
sweet
and
malt
forward
with
a
low
alcohol
burn
and
quick
lingering
bite
at
the
end
in
some
respects
it
reminded
me
of
a
wellaged
mellow
barleywine
o
nice
beer
that
is
much
more
than
i
expected
from
a
italian
brewer
it
is
a
bit
sweet
for
my
taste
but
still
worth
a
try
o
pretty
good
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
it
pours
out
of
the
bottle
a
rich
darkred
hue
that
is
reminiscent
to
killians
but
just
more
appealing
i
felt
it
looked
beautiful
the
head
pours
redtinged
pillowy
and
with
staying
power
good
lacing
down
the
entire
glass
i
was
slightly
disappointed
with
the
smell
i
could
only
pull
out
a
vague
cherry
malt
it
was
mostly
barley
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
good
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
no
stickiness
or
aftertaste
but
a
tiny
bit
watery
the
taste
however
was
superb
i
could
taste
the
distant
cherry
and
even
honey
flavors
the
beer
i
felt
offered
i
was
rewarded
for
my
random
selection
indeed
overall
i
was
very
pleased
with
the
beer
noticed
its
high
abv
soon
after
i
downed
it
and
wished
i
had
ordered
another
one
for
the
road
this
beer
is
far
superior
to
the
regular
moretti
it
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
red
color
with
several
inches
of
snow
white
head
the
color
is
dense
and
deep
mildly
intimidating
and
very
appetizing
the
nose
is
fairly
heavy
on
the
red
malt
some
caramel
sweetness
an
alcoholic
kick
some
dried
fruit
and
plenty
of
minerals
the
flavor
though
takes
on
a
sort
of
bakery
vibe
lots
of
doughy
and
toasty
notes
of
different
origins
there
must
be
a
good
mix
of
grain
happening
here
there
is
a
second
or
so
of
sweetness
but
it
doesnt
last
thankfully
the
alcohol
really
cuts
the
residual
sugar
well
and
this
beer
is
in
outstanding
balance
i
like
it
with
pasta
dishes
seafood
grilled
meats
its
really
quite
versatile
its
got
a
lot
of
flavor
and
kick
without
being
at
all
filling
which
may
be
its
greatest
asset
its
unique
in
that
way
and
better
than
most
euro
imports
on
these
grounds
i
love
the
crispness
of
feel
despite
the
color
and
size
of
this
and
i
like
the
active
carbonation
which
keeps
it
on
the
lighter
side
a
rusty
aftertaste
arises
and
like
the
regular
moretti
it
is
that
indelible
unique
factor
that
makes
this
beer
memorable
for
me
probably
my
favorite
regular
import
from
italy
not
counting
the
specialty
stuff
overall
this
beer
was
drinkable
but
ill
be
looking
for
some
better
prospects
before
we
head
to
italy
overall
a
very
likable
doppelbock
that
has
slightly
underattenuated
maltiness
a
little
lacking
in
the
feel
and
smell
as
well
nabbed
a
bottle
at
gnocco
in
down
town
nyc
poured
into
branded
glassware
brew
poured
a
watery
purple
with
maroon
highlights
no
real
head
to
spiral
of
and
no
real
lacing
either
smells
heavy
lager
and
rather
macro
taste
however
is
much
nicer
bringing
out
nice
nutmeg
and
dopplebock
flavors
easy
drinker
nothing
supper
special
but
a
fine
tick
at
an
italian
restraint
taste
is
heavy
and
sweet
but
not
overbearingly
so
i
get
hints
of
dried
dark
fruit
like
plum
raisin
and
fig
a
solid
brew
with
an
unusual
angle
a
nice
medium
tinted
dark
beer
smells
nice
but
nothing
overpowering
comes
through
has
a
nice
malty
flavor
with
a
little
bitterness
while
drinking
it
but
it
does
linger
around
the
mouth
long
medium
consistency
a
little
pricey
but
overall
a
really
good
beer
smells
kind
of
caramely
tastes
the
same
but
with
a
little
bitterness
i
get
the
vanilla
someone
earlieer
mentioned
easy
to
drink
kind
of
sweet
but
very
much
different
from
the
german
version
for
sure
nice
abv
decent
drink
love
most
stuff
italian
but
not
sure
how
heineken
got
its
hands
on
it
i
like
the
beer
though
and
gave
it
a
4
5
for
taste
more
of
a
4
25
but
that
doesnt
exist
d
a
really
tasty
dopplebock
all
the
flavours
are
there
but
not
overpowering
great
lager
clean
finish
a
great
winter
evening
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
crimsonbrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
and
dark
fruits
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slight
roast
quality
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
when
i
poured
this
one
it
has
a
nice
reddish
color
body
and
no
head
just
a
thin
lace
on
top
of
the
body
the
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
the
taste
has
a
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
and
some
dark
fruit
also
with
a
hint
of
hop
on
the
back
of
tongue
the
mouth
feel
is
kinda
sticky
leaves
a
nice
after
taste
of
malt
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
o
delectable
would
pair
well
with
roasted
meat
or
mild
curry
ill
admit
doppelbocks
arent
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
so
a
pretty
good
beer
especially
considering
how
boring
birra
moretti
is
the
ruby
red
body
is
nice
nothing
too
strong
on
the
nose
or
palate
but
at
least
tastewise
you
can
tell
there
is
a
subtle
complexity
to
it
the
alcohol
never
really
makes
itself
known
making
for
a
pretty
smooth
doppelbock
i
like
that
it
isnt
as
thick
or
sweet
as
others
in
its
alcohol
range
celebrator
optimator
but
at
the
same
time
a
little
stronger
flavor
overall
would
be
nice
overall
not
the
best
doppelbock
out
there
but
pretty
solid
considering
it
comes
from
a
macro
brewery
if
the
nose
did
not
have
the
unpleasant
stale
grain
note
i
would
consider
buying
it
again
o
good
example
of
the
style
i
did
enjoy
it
o
really
surprisingly
good
and
one
i
would
certainly
have
again
thinking
of
italian
foods
it
might
pair
with
we
came
up
with
a
cream
sauce
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
lightness
to
wateriness
around
the
edges
carbonation
is
midlevel
creating
a
gentle
foaming
effect
on
the
palate
that
render
the
mouthfeel
to
be
smooth
and
soft
closes
out
semidry
with
a
hint
of
residual
tannins
and
a
modest
sweetstickiness
around
the
lips
spicy
fusel
alcohols
perhaps
during
close
along
back
of
throat
somewhat
detract
and
are
somewhat
unexpected
for
a
7
2
doppelbock
o
paired
this
with
some
fine
italian
cuisine
and
have
to
admit
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
so
much
so
i
ordered
a
second
bottle
glad
to
recommend
o
a
very
maltcentric
brew
not
surprising
given
the
style
its
very
sweet
of
course
with
little
to
no
hop
presence
alcohol
is
wellhidden
and
its
overall
fairly
enjoyable
if
a
little
simple
not
bad
at
all
not
the
best
or
the
worst
dopplebock
i
have
tasted
but
definitely
room
for
improvement
atmosphere
is
very
good
nice
body
full
lingering
head
and
some
persistent
lacing
nose
is
well
balanced
combination
of
malty
character
and
sweet
and
herbal
tones
flavor
is
subtly
balanced
tone
of
malt
and
sweet
and
bitters
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
solid
malt
flavoring
throughout
and
the
smooth
and
integrated
finish
the
malts
stand
up
through
the
entire
brew
giving
a
full
quality
to
the
flavoring
by
the
finish
the
flavor
flattens
out
but
remains
calm
and
even
while
packing
all
the
punch
that
it
did
from
the
start
some
of
the
malts
however
gave
adjuncts
and
some
borderline
offensive
mustiness
through
the
middle
making
this
one
just
a
bit
more
of
a
chore
rjt
o
highly
enjoyable
doppelbock
i
ordered
a
second
with
my
meal
and
would
recommend
this
italian
beer
o
decent
dobblebock
this
is
a
beer
i
could
have
once
in
awhile
and
never
more
than
one
at
a
time
another
i
tasted
fresh
in
italy
pours
crystal
clear
maroonchestnut
brown
nicelooking
head
dissipates
rather
quickly
leaving
behind
no
lacing
a
lot
more
carbonated
than
expected
flavors
of
mild
caramel
vanilla
and
stone
fruit
with
some
mild
coffee
flavors
on
the
back
end
more
complex
than
i
expected
low
hopping
leaves
this
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
looks
and
feels
like
an
unsoured
flanders
red
in
terms
of
color
hopping
and
background
flavors
i
found
this
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
a
wonderful
italian
beer
sw
what
complements
this
beer
well
i
had
it
in
s
sioux
city
at
trattoria
fresca
while
chowing
on
some
fantastic
grilled
sea
food
you
know
calamari
octapus
and
scallops
i
drank
it
while
watching
ac
milan
playing
soccer
or
while
listening
to
giorgio
gaslinis
cd
entitled
plays
sun
ra
on
my
ipod
o
considering
its
strength
and
relatively
fullbodied
nature
this
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
overall
good
beer
a
bit
strong
to
have
more
than
one
definatly
not
my
favorite
style
but
not
a
bad
doppelbock
better
than
most
american
takes
on
the
style
but
still
nothing
i
would
really
come
back
to
m
lager
character
nice
ending
with
medium
ending
nothing
to
impressive
but
good
enough
o
a
malty
mess
here
not
terrible
but
i
would
love
some
sort
of
balance
o
a
nice
tasting
beer
thebeeralmanac
com
oa
decent
doppelbock
that
is
very
drinkable
presentation
packaged
in
an
11
2
ounce
custom
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a

i
never
anticipated
that
i
would
be
impressed
by
an
italian
doppelbock
produced
by
a

brewing
conglomerate
but
apparently
i
was
wrong
this
beer
definitely
holds
its
own
even
with
some
of
the
better
german
versions
of
the
style
certainly
one
of
the
best
italian
macro
brews
overalla
very
balanced
drinkable
and
delicately
complex
bock
beer
very
nice
and
pleasantly
surprising
its
maybe
just
a
tad
too
sweet
but
i
love
the
look
balance
and
strength
of
this
beer
overall
i
didnt
think
this
was
that
bad
i
was
given
this
as
a
sample
and
only
tried
it
because
it
was
free
not
my
style
at
all
but
a
decent
refreshing
brew
if
you
are
in
to
the
european
yeast
danky
beers
you
will
probably
love
this
overall
this
beer
wasnt
that
good
and
if
im
going
to
have
a
doppel
its
going
to
be
troegenator
prost
12
oz
bottle
pours
slightly
hazy
dark
red
with
brown
overtones
and
a
small
white
head
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
cherry
fruit
and
just
a
slight
hint
of
hops
the
body
is
full
and
smooth
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malt
cherry
and
hints
of
earthy
hops
long
sweet
but
not
cloying
finish
i
would
prefer
a
little
bit
more
hops
for
better
balance
in
this
brew
havent
had
one
o
these
since
my
beer
passport
back
in
college
might
as
well
try
one
again
as
my
dbock
appreciation
has
definitely
gone
way
up
since
then
this
one
pours
a
clear
garnetamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
dusty
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
rye
bread
yeast
toffee
butter
and
a
pinch
of
nutmeg
the
taste
holds
notes
of
rye
bread
blackened
nigh
charred
bread
and
toffee
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nearly
smooth
but
also
kinda
watery
feel
overall
i
was
not
impressed
at
all
by
this
brew
especially
if
its
trying
to
pass
itself
off
as
a
doppelbock
its
not
necessarily
bad
just
really
weak
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
decent
brown
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
on
it
the
smell
was
a
little
malty
but
mostly
had
the
larger
funk
aroma
going
on
the
taste
of
the
beer
wasnt
sweet
enough
in
my
opinion
the
malts
were
lacking
here
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
giving
off
a
little
bit
of
a
fuller
body
overall
its
not
the
best
doppelbock
out
there
and
i
feel
that
some
of
the
character
it
should
have
is
missing
ill
leave
this
one
on
the
shelves
last
beer
of
the
night
along
with
my
pizza
at
tulunes
southside
saloon
was
la
rossa
recommended
by
the
best
bartender
in
johnstown
heres
looking
out
joe
the
color
is
a
rich
ruby
red
with
nice
white
head
that
laced
quite
well
the
aroma
was
on
the
sweet
and
malty
side
the
taste
was
tough
for
me
there
is
a
malt
used
in
europe
that
gives
beer
a
nutra
sweet
flavor
and
i
dont
like
it
this
beer
starts
off
grainy
then
turns
to
a
sweetness
which
i
attribute
to
a
malt
that
i
cant
pinpoint
mouthfeel
was
tough
due
the
higher
abv
i
like
it
well
enough
but
the
higher
alcohol
isnt
quite
covered
up
enough
for
me
i
was
surprised
when
i
noted
it
was
only
7
the
sort
of
medicinish
flavor
draws
down
a
bit
also
i
like
it
but
am
not
in
love
with
it
a
deep
brown
with
a
beautiful
thick
head
that
unfortunately
fades
fast
to
a
thin
ring
that
retains
throughout
lace
is
left
in
creamy
rings
on
my
new
belgium
tulip
the
smell
is
sweet
of
honey
caramel
and
a
touch
of
booze
some
earthy
hops
and
something
metallic
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
honey
and
caramel
up
front
immediately
followed
by
spicy
black
pepper
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
a
touch
of
coffee
and
some
herbal
bitterness
alcohol
could
be
hidden
better
the
booze
bite
doesnt
blend
well
into
the
bitterness
it
is
also
attacking
my
stomach
overall
it
is
a
bit
watery
for
a
dopplebock
not
my
favorite
of
this
style
but
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
i
havent
tried
a
true
german
doppelbock
but
id
have
to
think
that
this
beer
is
spot
on
for
the
style
really
worth
trying
if
you
like
this
style
overall
a
passable
doppelbock
but
certainly
an
improvement
over
other
italian
beers
ive
had
if
this
is
the
direction
italian
brewing
is
moving
in
there
should
be
quite
a
few
interesting
brews
to
try
from
them
in
the
future
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
i
liked
this
beer
yes
it
had
a
dark
amber
appearance
gentle
aroma
and
carmelchocolate
combo
in
the
taste
i
enjoyed
the
sense
of
carbonation
with
a
tad
bitterness
when
i
held
a
sip
in
my
mouth
but
for
me
it
got
an
exceptional
because
i
did
not
feel
the
need
to
match
this
brew
with
some
kind
of
snack
with
that
said
port
wine
cheddar
spread
is
a
nice
complement
to
the
la
rossa
o
great
tasting
dopplebock
for
a
nearly
criminally
cheap
price
if
you
like
this
style
hit
this
one
up
if
you
havent
already
morettis
dopplebock
what
they
call
la
rossa
though
it
is
actually
brown
in
color
is
a
very
good
version
of
a
dopplebock
its
color
and
mouthfeel
is
typical
of
this
type
but
nothing
exceptional
the
most
important
part
the
taste
is
morettis
shining
moment
the
la
rossa
has
a
very
nice
malty
taste
that
masks
the
alcohol
content
which
is
pretty
high
for
beer
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
sip
or
drink
drinkability
well
the
decent
body
and
good
amount
of
roasted
malt
make
this
drinkable
in
terms
of
doppelbocks
this
is
very
high
on
the
list
very
modest
i
dont
think
i
will
go
back
to
this
impressive
looking
beer
clear
sparkling
amber
brown
with
a
large
creamy
two
finger
off
white
head
that
lasts
with
excellent
lacing
nice
malty
smell
and
medium
creamy
mouthfeel
but
taste
was
disappointing
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
the
taste
just
didnt
match
the
appearance
d
it
is
a
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
feels
lighter
than
most
doppelbocks
not
exactly
a
meal
in
a
bottle
this
is
not
something
ill
drink
again
overall
a
nice
fruity
doppelbock
with
a
good
alcohol
warming
at
the
end
this
seemed
like
it
was
going
to
be
a
good
beer
appearance
and
smell
but
flat
out
disappointed
with
the
taste
good
worth
trying
in
a
few
weeks
with
that
same
friend
we
are
going
to
have
a
similar
sidebyside
tasting
of
salvator
celebrator
optimator
and
la
rossa
after
this
tasting
ill
be
able
to
give
as
proper
comparison
of
some
of
the
best
dopplebocks
available
this
is
one
of
the
few
heinekenowned
beers
that
i
enjoy
overall
a
complex
and
good
beer
but
not
the
best
ive
had
a
very
nice
dopplebock
and
a
great
value
i
also
had
this
one
a
while
back
at
an
italian
restaurant
paired
with
some
fettuccine
alfredo
and
it
was
absolutely
delicious
in
the
world
of
fine
italian
cuisine
moretti
la
rossa
birra
doppio
malto
is
a
step
up
from
olive
garden
but
it
aint
a
large
step
you
can
find
better
italian
beers
and
you
can
certainly
find
many
better
doppelbocks
however
its
worth
a
try
and
it
definitely
does
go
well
with
pizza
dgot
better
with
every
sip
it
would
be
very
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
if
not
for
the
7
20
abv
d
well
i
did
like
it
and
as
a
10
dollar
six
pack
its
decent
but
i
would
go
with
other
offerings
deven
though
i
like
dark
beers
i
dont
think
id
be
able
to
drink
more
then
two
of
these
in
one
night
still
i
do
recommend
trying
it
moderate
head
on
pour
with
broken
lacing
that
has
little
cling
color
is
a
19
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
strong
caramel
molasses
and
oak
are
in
the
forefront
of
the
aromas
with
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
coffee
is
the
primary
flavor
i
detect
with
wisps
of
caramel
toffee
licorice
and
hops
mildly
full
in
my
mouth
with
a
nice
bump
in
the
back
of
the
soft
palate
a
little
heavy
and
harsh
for
everyday
drinking
but
would
be
nice
with
desert
pours
a
decent
brown
color
albeit
a
bit
light
for
a
doppelbock
with
a
bit
of
head
and
just
the
lightest
bit
of
lacing
decent
malty
sweet
aroma
but
not
overly
deep
and
thick
good
malty
flavor
with
decent
caramel
hints
not
horribly
thick
and
strong
but
not
bad
at
all
goes
down
quite
smoothly
pours
a
beautiful
reddish
amber
with
a
surprisingly
thick

subdued
aroma
tastes
silky
smooth
all
the
way
minimal
carbonation
elegant
malts
with
a
slight
hoppy
finish
although
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
this
is
a
real
quality
beer
for
an
industrial
scale
brew
d
a
very
nice
italian
dopplebock
i
think
i
could
stock
my
frig
with
this
one
and
would
happily
recommend
it
to
my
friends
very
tasty
on
its
own
la
rossa
is
a
shade
too
sweet
and
while
i
love
its
maltyness
the
flavor
isnt
particularly
refined
the
color
is
gorgeous
though
and
overall
i
definitely
recommend
giving
it
a
try
overall
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
beer
gets
no
publicity
or
credit
in
a
growing
market
for
bock
beers
try
try
try
poured
a
rich
dark
hazel
with
a
foamy
off
white
head
it
doesnt
bring
too
much
to
the
table
when
it
comes
to
aromas
its
basically
just
malt
and
thats
about
it
it
drinks
much
better
than
it
smells
it
has
good
bready
yeastyness
and
a
mellow
maple
like
sweetness
it
drinks
light
to
medium
bodied
and
is
pretty
smooth
the
alcohol
really
isnt
present
and
for
a
doppel
bock
this
one
isnt
too
bad
d
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
however
its
pretty
average
for
the
most
part
not
a
bad
beer
if
your
in
the
ticking
mood
sweet
caramel
brown
fruit
toffee
overbrowned
toast
some

bitterness
some
mineral
notes
nice
balance
between
the
sweet
the
bitter
and
the
rich
a
little
thinner
than
id
like
in
the
mouthfeel
than
id
like
but
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
a
very
easydrinking
doppelbock
not
overdone
or
overcomplicated
a
great
surprise
and
at
1

a
steal
for
something
like
this
drinkability
definitely
ok
just
not
something
i
think
ill
crave
d
a
drinkable
doppel
i
liked
this
quite
enjoyable
simple
yet
tasty
doppel
a
decent
example
of
the
style
from
birra
moretti
could
use
slightly
more
alcohol
but
otherwise
it
beats
the
other
offering
ive
had
from
them
final
notes
a
solid
beer
i
thought
it
was
rather
delicious
and
it
far
exceeded
my
expectations
for
an
italian
beer
that
said
it
just
doesnt
compete
with
the
best
american
and
german
doppelbocks
alas
i
really
enjoyed
it

not
bad
but
a
bit
thin
and
light
for

of

style
overall
a
nice
fullflavored
easily
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
that
particularly
stands
out
a
big
malt
bomb
of
a
beer
the
aroma
is
pretty
good
with
crusty
toast
and
caramel
notes
the
taste
is
vaguely
disappointing
though
while
it
has
a
nice
sweet
maltiness
theres
a
slight
flavor

its
also
perhaps
oversweet
fullbodied
and
creamy

help
make
up
a
little
a

surprise
from

good
show
poured
a
dark
amber
with
light
tan
two
finger

that
quickly
dissapated
to
thin

with

grains
malty
sweet
on

with
a
dry
finish
medium
bodied
with
desent
enough
carbonation
wasnt
really
what
i
had
hoped
for
d
easy
to
drink
would
buy
again
it
was
a
good
beer
d
surprisingly
drinkable
la
rossa
is
so
well
balanced
its
scary
the
heavy
malting
never
overpowers
anything
as
it
remains
lightly
sweet
and
smooth
this
was
a
surprising
treat
i
didnt
expect
to
deliver
so
well
crystal
clear
deep
red
with
a
tight
beige
cap
of
fine
bubbles
good
head
retention
and
some
spotty
lacing
very
malty
aroma
clean
and
sweet
with
a
hint
of
caramel
bitterness
had
some
presence
but
stayed
low
relative
to
the
sweet
malt
and
caramel
flavours
light
spicy
hop
flavour
and
bitterness
lingered
along
with
a
bit
of
toffee
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
made
up
of
fine
bubbles
nice
texture
overall
quite
enjoyable
easy
drinking
with
a
pleasant
malty
character
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
couple
inches
of
light
tan
head
it
is
brown
in
color
with
orange
highlights
the
aroma
is
full
of
sweet
toffee
and
caramel
the
taste
starts
out
with
the
toffeecaramel
but
then
i
get
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
viscous
this
beer
is
better
than
expected
i
am
actually
enjoying
this
unlike
a
lot
of
the
european
turds
i
have
been
getting
at
my
beers
around
the
world
hangout
i
would
drink
this
again
overall
its
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again
and
i
would
recomend
trying
this
if
you
are
looking
a
decent
italian
beer
its
much
better
than
peroni
the
body
was
pretty
average
for
a
brew
of
this
type
light
but
not
helium
light
drinkability
was
decent
id
grab
a
couple
bottles
to
take
to
the
park
for
lunch
try
this
if
you
if
you
see
it
caramel
domination
no
hop
presence
medium
viscosity
a
decent
enough
beer
doesnt
offend
doesnt
blow
any
socks
off
cant
picture
it
with
italian
food
might
be
decent
w
mexican
beer
is
medium
body
i
think
the
moderate
carbonation
in
the
mouth
helps
to
fill
it
out
the
flavors
are
strongly
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
and
some
roast
in
the
back
i
could
do
without
this
much
roast
but
stylistically
it
is
fine
overall
d
relatively
light
doppelbrock
with
solid
7
2
abv
taste
is
where
this
shines
nicely
rich
mouthfeel
with
plenty
of
crisp
carbonation
quite
balanced
thus
letting
the
malts
and
hops
to
unify
into
a
really
tasty
sessionable
brew
i
catch
slightly
toasted
caramel
with
a
veneer
of
hop
presence
being
it
seems
right
where
it
should
be
sure
its
malty
but
again
balance
is
evident
almost
everywhere
very
refreshing
and
fulfilling
the
best
moretti
ive
had
yet
surprised
delightfully
so
aftertaste
tobacco
mexican
chocolate
and
a
little
bit
coffee
note
d
pretty
sweet
this
sample
is
old
though
and
hard
to
enjoy
easily
and
infinitely
better
than
the
birra
moretti
lager
this
beer
has
some
nice
flavors
to
offer
sweet
and
roasty
malts
with
a
heavy
dose
of
nuttiness
walnuts
and
almonds
even
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
is
in
there
not
cloyingly
sweet
like
some
doppels
tend
to
be
and
has
a
noticeable
hop
bite
on
the
finish
that
is
appreciated
carbonation
levels
are
decent
but
the
beer
is
still
thin
compared
to
the
best
of
the
style
there
is
a
mild
astringency
that
comes
in
midpalate
and
lingers
a
bit
that
is
mildly
distracting
not
like
this
will
supplant
celebrator
on
anyones
favorites
list
but
this
is
a
worthwhile
beer
and
i
am
glad
i

caramel
flavor
and
enough
hops
to
give
a
good
bitterness
to
the
bite
with
a
lingering
softness
chewy
robust
and
full
of
grain
this
would
go
well
with
a
meateaters
pizza
cooked
in
a
wood
burning
oven
overall
great
brew
its
a
nice
alternative
to
the
standard
peroni
and
moretti
lagers
you
get
at
most
italian
joints
dr
actually
very
good
surprised
me
didnt
expect
much
from
an
italian
beer
might
be
my
own
ignorance
smooth
and
easy
drinking
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
was
not
aware
it
was
a
doppelbock
until
i
can
came
to
review
it
d
a
good
beer
gives
a
different
twist
on
doppelbocks
but
still
tastes
like
one
md
the
feel
is
above
medium
bodied
the
liquid
is
smooth
goes
down
like
a
champ
no
alcohol
gets
in
the
way
carb
is
low
where
it
should
be
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
dopple
that
is
worthy
of
a
repeat
visit
the
palate
comes
on
sweet
lush
and
full
like
a
classic
german
then
turns
firm
and
dry
not
the
most
complex
version
of
the
style
but
full
flavored
and
delicious
anyway
love
this
type
of
beer
and
its
affordable
for
a
rich
strong
lager
satisfying
d
decently
drinkable
although
the
alcohol
buzzed
me
on
this
on
an
empty
stomach
after
one
mfd
medium
body
with
a
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
slight
alcoholic
warmth
but
went
down
nicely
appears
a
brownish
amber
beneath
a
somewhat
frothy
tan
head
not
much
head
retention
but
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
smells
like
caramel
malts
and
brown
sugar
a
faint
amount
of
hops
and
an
earthy
quality
i
cant
quite
discern
tastes
pretty
malty
up
front
with
some
hops
a
bit
bready
and
grainy
in
the
middle
with
a
caramelesque
residual
sweetness
on
finish
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
reminds
me
of
an
oktoberfest
more
than
a
dopplebock
has
decent
balance
on
the
taste
front
but
nothing
that
stands
out
as
special
feels
pretty
smooth
in
the
mouth
its
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
fairly
light
goes
down
easy
but
for
a
dopplebock
its
a
little
tame
for
me
i
prefer
a
darker
one
with
more
roasted
smells
and
flavors
this
could
just
about
be
classified
as
a
maerzen
and
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
overall
not
a
bad
beer
and
certainly
drinkable
but
not
an
outstanding
dopplebock
poured
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
modest
head
that
rapidly
faded
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
not
present
for
me
the
taste
was
not
overly
sweet
molasses
though
not
syrupy
there
was
also
a
little
hoppy
bitter
that
made
things
interesting
the
feel
was
medium
bodied
with
fairly
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
real
good
a
reasonable

need
to
probably
revisit
this

to
get
a
proper
tasting

drinkability
is
about

overall
this
is
a
fairly
decent
brew
overall
a
decent
beer
not
very
exciting
but
i
will
never
refuse
another
one
very
drinkable
overall
it
holds
its
own
in
the
battle
against
the
germans
but
it
could
use
a
bit
more
flavor
to
properly
bask
amongst
the
german
doppelbock
giants
d
very
drinkable
steady
choice
when
im
in
italy
together
with
the
doppio
malto
from
moretti
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
the
mass
produced
imports
and
doppelbocks
are
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
both
i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
pours
a
cool
stained
wood
type
of
color
decent
head
to
it
which
dissipates
fairly
quickly
perfume
like
type
of
aroma
also
some
alcohol
can
be
detected
taste
wise
its
very
smooth
and
creamy
pretty
sweet
and
a
nice
body
to
this
one
certainly
quite
malty
and
has
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
kick
to
it
due
to
the
7
2
abv
but
it
all
goes
together
well
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
ive
tried
and
go
figure
its
an
italian
import
solid
brew
would
recommend
if
youre
in
the
same
situation
the
bottle
has
been
redesigned
since
the
last
pic
entry
i
guess
this
one
just
works
well
with
my
palate
enjoy
glad
i
didnt
get
a
whole
sixer
of
this
i
could
probably
drink
this
again
but
with
other
much
better
doppelbocks
out
there
why
bother

not
a

d
overall
a
decent
and
unique
dopple
i
would
prefer
it
had
a
smoother
fade
though
seems
too
dry
and
bitter
notes
expiration
of
november
2009
label
lists
that
it
was
brewed
and
bottled
in
milan
this
just
shows
me
that
birra
moretti
is
able
to
brew
a
good
beer
they
just
sell
much
more
of
the
weak
euro
lager
stuff
i
guess
not
a
bad
dobblebock
at
all
pleasantly
surprised
and
would
have
no
problem
picking
up
a
full
sixer
instead
of
the
one
and
done
sample
tried
here
ordered
a
bottle
last
night
while
having
dinner
at
carlos
cucina
in
allston
poured
into
a
an
oversized
juice
glass
dark
reddish
brown
color
strong
pour
needed
to
form
a
head
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
sugary
and
spicy
smell
tons
of
malt
with
the
first
sip
a
real
malt
bomb
thick
enough
body
but
not
overly
to
make
it
hard
to
drink
rather
smooth
actually
a
nice
offering
from
moretti
heineken
a
nice
beer
to
accompany
my
fettucini
with
plum
tomato
sauce
and
veal
this
beer
stands
up
well
to
a
hearty
italian
dish
im
pretty
impressed
with
la
rossa
i
wasnt
expecting
much
out
of
it
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
decent
bock
it
could
be
improved
with
a
couple
of
easy
tweaks
tone
down
the
dark
fruit
flavor
and
the
alcohol
just
a
bit
a
little
more
body
would
probably
help
but
perhaps
not
materially
all
in
all
its
pretty
good
and
better
than
expected
perhaps
my
expectations
dropped
a
little
too
much
when
i
saw
the
word
heineken
in
the
profile
definitely
worth
checking
out
if
you
run
across
a
bottle
dim
a
complete
malt
head
i
wish
i
could
get
12packs
of
it
conclusion
this
was
a
fairly
unexpected
treat
a
germanstyle
beer
from
italy
i
mean
cmon
i
paired
this
with
dried
figs
and
dark
bread
and
it
was
quite
nice
not
a
home
run
but
solid
d
i
could
have
it
again
and
would
but
i
wouldnt
have
2
in
a
row
d
good
but
may
be
a
bit
bitter
for
the
type
of
beer
but
it
is
manageable
good
beginning
beer
good
dark
italian
beer
that
poured
with
a
decent
head
rich
deep
taste
like
a
porter
with
a
dominant
roasted
malt
flavor
along
with
sweet
caramel
coffeetoffee
and
faint
hops
smooth
drinking
with
a
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
stands
out
from
all
other
italian
beers
that
ive
had
since
it
has
more
flavor
and
all
the
others
seem
to
be
along
the
lines
of
a
pilsner
its
a
little
light
for
a
doppelboack
but
still
a
good
beer
the
drinkability
is
ok
i
can
drink
a
12
oz
of
this
no
problem
unless
i
was
at
an
italian
place
where
this
and
regulat
moretti
were
the
options
i
would
probably
not
drink
again
i
drank
it
but
it
wasnt
as
enjoyable
as
the
pour
had
made
the
beer
out
to
be
if
you
like
malt
you
like
this
beer
very
consistent
taste
for
the
name
double
malt
drinkability
despite
this
beers
ultrafilling
nature
this
is
one
i
always
go
back
to
when
im
at
the
bar
and
not
in
the
mood
for
something
new
i
have
to
say
that
i
was
initially
dubious
of
this
beer
as
seeming
too
mainstream
but
perhaps
this
beer
renaissance
we
are
living
in
has
encouraged
too
much
snobbery
in
the
average
joe
get
a
case
of
this
for
your
next
casual
party
and
everyone
will
be
satisfied
i
really
liked
this
doppio
malto
on
a
wet
spring
day
here
in
pa
drinkability
a
sweettasting
easy
drinking
relatively
cheap
beer
so
it
definitely
has
some
things
going
for
it
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
and
slightly
dry
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
body
and
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
this
is
good
doppelbock
the
nose
has
an
edge
over
the
taste
if
they
would
have
been
close
i
would
have
given
it
a
better
rating
easy
drinking
beer
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
the
high
alcohol
content
wears
on
me
a
bit
finally
there
is
a
slight
metallic
taste
that
i
dont
like
overall
this
is
just
an
okay
dopplebock
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
celebrator
and
actually
probably
my
least
favorite
dopplebock
to
date
an
interesting
take
on
a
dopplebock
appearance
is
quite
good
nice
and
dark
with
a
creamy
head
smell
and
taste
are
decent
a
bit
to
coffee
creamer
type
for
me
malt
was
nice
and
dry
though
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
body
and
still
carbonated
drinkability
is
decent
halfway
decent
example
of
a
doppelbock
creamy
and
tasty
but
not
to
the
point
of
excellence
very
drinkable
i
really
like
this
beer
in
fact
im
surprised
ive
never
had
the
chance
to
enjoy
one
before
this
beer
should
be
a
regular
in
everyones
stock
dont
hesitate
go
get
one
now
drinkability
would
be
better
if
it
wasnt
so
sweet
and
thin
the
alcohol
hides
well
but
one
is
enough
this
beer
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
it
gave
a
great
amount
of
head
that
reduced
down
to
wisps
of
lacing
the
amberish
bronze
colored
beer
gave
off
a
cloves
coliander
citrus
and
of
fresh
oven
bread
the
taste
followed
suit
but
also
gave
had
a
toffee
flavoring
and
a
bit
of
pepper
overall
a
great
beer
that
went
down
smooth
beer
pours
very
nice
it
leaves
a
nice
little
head
in
a
regular
beer
glass
definately
a
roasty
and
malty
flavor
smooth
mouthfeel
but
barely
any
hop
bitterness
perfectly
balanced
beer
but
just
a
tiny
bit
more
hop
bitterness
would
be
nice
even
for
a
doppelbock
pours
a
deep
clear
red
with
medium
offwhite
head
flavorful
slight
bitter
taste
with
smooth
finish
had
three
at
a
restaurant
bar
before
dinner
definitely
better
than
an
amberbock
ordered
as
it
was
the
only
import
besides
heineken
blah
among
mbc
beers
cheers
overall
a
well
made
beer
but
a
little
bit
light
for
what
i
was
expecting
i
liked
it
but
not
really
more
than
that
it
left
me
feeling
neutral
its
the
only
word
that
describes
my
feeling
for
it
gave
this
guy
a
fairly
vigorous
pour
came
out
a
beautifully
clear
dark
amber
with
a
big
brown
head
bubbles
racing
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
to
the
top
smells
of
caramels
and
butterscotch
and
sweet
roasted
malts
with
faint
resinous
hops
taste
is
milder
than
i
would
prefer
but
good
nonetheless
initially
sweet
maltiness
caramels
and
burnt
sugar
before
the
hops
come
into
play
and
linger
on
the
finish
the
taste
of
alcoholic
and
metal
give
this
a
somewhat
chemically
taste
that
keeps
me
from
giving
it
4
on
flavor
but
its
mediumfull
body
is
wellsupported
by
moderate
carbonation
and
overall
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
especially
given
its
high
abv
drinkability
nice
easy
drink
would
try
again
if
i
came
across
it
overall
notes
started
off
great
but
strayed
near
the
end
i
would
keep
sipping
this
one
continuously
so
that
i
dont
get
the
funky
aftertaste
at
the
end
stuck
in
my
mouth
nice
to
try
but
im
not
sure
if
id
get
it
again
for
a
7
2
beer
la
rossa
is
very
drinkable
when
i
reach
for
a
doppelbock
its
usually
this
splendid
little
number
d
good
beer
to
sip
on
it
seems
strong
to
me
tonight
but
i
usually
love
the
booziness
d
great
its
a
nice
pair
with
a
pizza
instead
of
cutting
through
and
overpowering
the
tomato
and
crust
it
acted
as
a
nice
compliment
to
the
flavors
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
the
appearance
is
a
pretty
deep
wood
brown
attractive
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
guess
does
have
much
of
a
head
to
it
smells
like
an
average
dark
beer
the
taste
is
surprisingly
refreshing
bits
of
chocolate
and
coffee
hiding
under
the
hops
moderate
mouthfeel
not
too
bubbly
and
goes
down
easy
all
in
all
a
great
beer
to
have
with
a
pasta
in
a
heavy
meat
sauce
my
beer
of
choice
when
i
eat
italian
out
when
poured
it
was
a
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
with
very
little
tan
foam
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
fruit
and
a
hint
of
caramel
had
a
pleasant
aroma
to
this
doppelbock
after
the
first
sip
a
touch
of
roasted
malts
and
caramel
was
a
pleasant
surprise
then
i
could
taste
rasins
and
dates
on
my
palate
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
doppelbock
that
i
will
purchase
again
and
again
bottom
line
a
nice
offering
from
this
brewery
for
sure
i
recommend
it
moretti
la

poured
a
dark

and
i
mean
dark
almost
appeared
brown
smell
was
of
sweet
malt
and
hints
of
hops
smell
was
a
bit
on
the
light
side
however
taste
was
excellent

milk
chocolate
up

followed
by
bittersweet
dark
chocolate

with

crispness
mouthfeel
was
good
decent
carbonation
that
helped
add
to
the
crisp
finish
drinability
was
good
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
great
deal
i
can
not
believe
that
this
is
from
italy
this
is
not
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
italian
beer
normally
it
is
just
pale
lagers
but
this
stuff
is
not
you
typical
italian
beer
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
dpretty
good
found
a
single
of
this
and
i
might
buy
again
quite
filling
as
is
fitting
for
the
style
i
havent
had
a
beer
with
so
much
strawberry
in
it
that
is
not
specifically
a
fruit
beer
does
not
touch
my
beloved
optimator
but
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
7
a
sixer
is
a
very
nice
price
id
certainly
pick
this
up
again
solid
across
the
board
and
easy
enough
to
drink
better
choices
than
this
sure
better
choices
at
the
nearest
beer
store
open
until
midnight
or
later
nope
not
at
this
price
m
the
taste
is
sweet
stewed
dried
fruit
a
lot
of
raisins
and
prunes
with
toasted
bread
fresh
grapes
hints
of
wine
and
licorice
and
overall
tasty
yet
balanced
and
smooth
with
a
light
alcoholic
spiciness
and
warmth
light
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweetness
and
a
full
slightly
oily
feel
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
for
the
type
aside
from
the
warm
body
and
light
winey
quality
it
goes
well
with
food
too
which
is
not
true
of
many
bocks
or
doppelbocks
in
my
experience
and
it
is
unusually
drinkable
for
the
type
d
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
considering
its
primary
brewer
heineken
an
interesting
beer
to
try
pours
a
brown
color
pretty
good
tan
head
but
it
fades
halfway
through
the
beer
some
spotty
lacing
malty
sugary
sweet
spicy
and
sour
some
alcohol
does
show
and
it
is
a
bit
warming
i
did
enjoy
this
one
nice
dopplebock
from
italy
mid
body
low
on
the
carbonation
alright
beer
probably
will
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
quite
sure
if
id
call
it
a
dopplebock
but
i
did
enjoy
this
one
i
must
admit
that
i
was
expecting
either
a
big
let
down
or
something
completely
unexpected
with
this
beer
poured
a
really
deep
red
color
with
decent
head
and
moderate
lacing
the
aroma
of
this
one
was
very
good
with
hints
of
sweet
malts
and
a
touch
of
hops
flavor
was
exceptional
a
sweet
doppelbock
that
tends
to
bring
you
full
circle
with
flavors
of
caramel
and
other
tasty
malts
this
beer
reminded
me
alot
of
heinekens
special
dark
only
much
better
a
very
good
beer
all
in
all
appearance
is
an
amber
brown
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
aroma
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
caramel
there
is
an
slight
but
odd
macro
scent
flavor
is
increidbly
rich
and
malty
there
are
toasty
hints
and
a
decent
amount
of
hop
flavor
slight
metalllic
taste
very
sweet
and
straightforward
brew
nothing
crazy
going
on
here
the
feel
is
smooth
and
slick
after
the
first
time
i
had
one
of
these
i
was
surprised
to
find
out
that
it
was
a
dopplebock
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
it
tastes
more
like
the
combination
of
a
milk
stout
and
a
brown
ale
overall
this
is
a
clean
doppelbock
but
is
missing
the
intense
melanoidins
and
rich
maltiness
of
the
great
style
examples
looks
great
tastes
clean
more
malt
complexity
would
surely
improve
this
glad
i
only
bought
one
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
it
was
undrinkable
filtered
clear
body
small
quickly
diminishing
foam
aroma
had
hardly
any
character
maybe
a
touch
of
roast
flavor
has
sweet
fruit
notes
and
some
caramellike
malt
character
no
flaws
probably
not
deserving
of
such
a
low
score
but
i
didnt
like
any
of
its
attributes
and
i
didnt
enjoy
the
beer
at
all
some
italian
beers
help
me
realize
why
my
greatgrandfather
joe
left
italy
however
this
one
makes
me
wonder
why
poured
a
bright
copperbronze
color
with
white
head
that
stayed
a
while
and
left
nice
lacing
on
glass
aroma
is
sweet
roasted
malt
flavor
is
a
combination
of
molasses
chocolate
and
caramel
flavor
is
balanced
by
hops
which
provide
a
bitter
aftertaste
alcohol
is
present
in
taste
medium
bodied
and
fairly
easy
drinking
decent
doppelbock
for
a
country
more
known
for
wine
very
tasty
and
drinkable
especially
at
7
2
percent
id
have
no
problem
devouring
quite
a
few
of
these
malts
dried
fruit
and
noble
hops
that
help
a
balance
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
and
provides
a
sort
of
smokiness
and
spice
to
match
the
roasted
caramelly
malt
not
quite
as
sweet
or
leaning
to
the
malt
side
as
say
tommyknocker
dopplebock
this
beer
is
a
little
heavier
than
most
you
may
only
want
one
or
two
drinkable
but
not
sessionable
if
you
can
find
it
try
it
this
is
the
best
italian
beer
ive
tried
thus
far
peroni
blue
ribbon
is
blech
skunky
euro
pilsner
and
moretti
lager
is
soso
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
i
had
it
served
to
me
in
a
bottle
at
rosebud
on
rush
in
chicago
this
fine
beer
had
a
great
caramel
look
to
the
pour
with
a
thin
head
it
had
a
great
not
bitter
but
piney
after
taste
sweet
and
crisp
a
very
sophisticated
beer
that
went
great
with
the
veal
saltimbocca
overall
impression
a
highly
drinkable
well
balanced
bock
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
this
is
quite
enjoyable
strongly
recommended
this
beer
has
only
7
2
vol
but
the
alcohol
is
very
pronounced
and
overlaying
anything
else
that
might
have
been
there
as
well
solid
beer
across
the
board
seems
like
a
hybrid
between
a
doppelbock
and
a
maibock
almost
who
cares
that
its
brewed
by
heineken
i
think
some
reviewers
do
unfortunately
its
a
good
brew
made
for
a
great
beer
to
go
along
with
a
roast
beef
sandwich
or
piece
of
homemade
pastry
or
vegetable
soup
i
never
drank
more
than
one
since
i
was
drinking
on
break
from
classes
after
all
but
at
3
a
bottle
i
could
have
drank
em
all
day
if
it
was
closer
to
home

also
not

good

and
works
well
with
a

of
food
i
eat
d
goes
down
easily
could
have
a
few
in
an
evening
but
wouldnt
have
any
more
than
that
especially
when
there
are
so
many
better
options

malty
with
a
grainy
cereal
aroma
mixed
in

and
a

the
finish
had
a
very
slight

was

in

palate
making
this
beer
quite
drinkable
and
quaffable
no
sign
of
the

printed
on
the
label
this
is
a
pretty
decent
example
of
a
double
bock
but
not
near
as
bold
and
assertive
as
say
salvator
or
sam
adams
double
bock
good
to
see
this
back
on
the
shelves
though
after
not
seeing
it
for
5
or
6
years
d
perfect
with
pasta
stereotypical
statement
yes
but
its
a
true
one
d
drinkability
is
good
all
the
characteristics
for
this
brew
come
together
to
make
a
good
overall
beverage
i
would
have
no
problem
having
several
of
these
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
color
the
head
is
huge
fluffy
and
recedes
slowly
into
thick
chunky
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
a
toffee
with
a
hint
of
butter
the
taste
has
more
toffee
than
the
aroma
with
a
nice
caramel
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
which
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
would
like
in
a
doppelbock
carbonation
is
lively
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
there
are
a
lot
better
doppelbocks
out
there
i
poured
this
brew
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
a
coca
colo
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
the
smell
was
caramally
the
beer
had
a
sweet
taste
that
was
pretty
nice
and
it
tasted
caramally
the
maltiness
was
nice
and
i
would
buy
this
again
very
drinkable
alcohol
well
hidden
a
tasty
beer
drinkablity
easily
consumable
brew
plenty
of
flavor
and
a
decent
kick
all
in
all
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
especially
coming
from
a
country
that
isnt
known
for
beer
it
was
a
decent
doppelbock
although
it
would
be
considered
mediocre
at
best
against
better
competition
worth
a
try
for
sure
and
should
be
commended
pours
a
very
nice
amber
color
with
medium
head
pleasant
malt
aroma
flavor
is
fairly
well
balanced
a
bit
more
on
the
malty
side
which
i
prefer
nothing
to
jump
up
and
down
about
but
a
pretty
solid
and
drinkable
beer
worth
a
try
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
chimay
chalice
poured
a
deep
brown
amber
with
a
sizable
off
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
while
but
finally
melded
into
a
nice
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
at
the
first
whiff
i
couldnt
quite
place
the
aroma
but
after
about
a
minute
of
smelling
i
finally
got
it
special
k
it
smelled
like
a
big
bowl
of
corn
flakes
plain
with
no
sugar
or
milk
it
tastes
primarily
of
lightly
roasted
malts
i
really
enjoy
the
toasty
flavor
but
there
is
a
fake
smoke
taste
also
it
tastes
kind
of
like
beggin
strips
smell
mouthfeel
is
interesting
different
than
about
another
beer
ive
had
but
i
cant
really
describe
it
i
dont
know
if
ill
pick
this
up
again
there
are
some
good
qualities
to
this
beer
but
a
couple
really
bad
ones
to
its
a
balancing
act
that
i
dont
know
that
they
got
right
this
beer
was
very
thin
for
my
taste
the
thinness
allowed
a
lot
of
the
grain
no
show
through
which
took
away
from
the
overall
balance
of
the
beer
for
a
doppelbock
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
i
would
turn
it
down
if
given
to
me
but
i
wont
be
buying
a
six
pack
anytime
soon
the
great
beerhunter
michael
jackson
claimed
that
there
was
no
better
beer
to
pair
with
piszza
than
birra
morettis
la
rosa
and
as
i
sit
here
eating
a
slice
i
must
agree
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
are
great
sweet
yet
bitter
with
a
pleasing
finish
and
after
taste
appearance
is
very
nice
dark
brown
almost
bordering
purple
with
a
creamy
frothy
head
to
top
it
off
smell
is
rich
dark
and
likewise
complex
taste
is
also
rich
creamy
with
hints
of
toffee
vanilla
caramel
and
sweetness
combined
with
a
subtle
bitterness
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
brew
and
the
combination
of
spicy
cheesy
pizza
fits
well
with
the
bittersweet
aftertaste
of
this
beer
a
good
drink
to
pair
with
food
and
definitely

d
its
easy
to
drink
however
the
strong
sweet
flavor
is
likely
to
limit
my
consumption
to
after
dinner
and
to
one
per
session
there
are
better
doppelbocks
on
the
market

amberdopple
hybrid

is

the

is

and
this
would
go
well
with
various
italian
foods
this
has
a
little
more
charisma
than
the
other
international
lagers
i
have
sampled
tonight
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
it
up
again
but
this
may
be
better
than
other
offerings
in
your
local
restaurant
definitely
a
decent
example
of
a
dopplebock
and
a
surprise
that
its
from
moretti
its
not
extremely
complex
but
its
consistently
a
very
good
dependable
beer
this
was
one
of
my
early
favorite
beers
and
it
actually
withstands
the
test
of
time
pretty
well
recommended
this
beer
is
a
deep
reddish
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
head
is
initially
quite
tall
but
falls
to
a
thin
film
the
aroma
is
enticing
rich
malt
and
a
little
toasted
grain
smell
almost
no
hops
but
the
grain
and
malt
are
solid
and
inviting
the
flavor
is
equally
good
sweet
and
malty
with
a
little
toasted
barley
its
clean
with
no
fruit
esters
at
all
the
beer
gets
a
little
bitter
right
before
the
finish
theres
also
a
surprising
alcohol
warming
that
crops
up
after
a
few
sips
this
is
a
solidly
good
beer
full
in
body
and
satisfying
i
can
easily
see
this
being
my
goto
beer
in
italy
d
i
wont
drink
this
again
but
its
not
awful
d
id
had
one
before
wasnt
overly
impressed
but
2nd
time
around
was
much
better
a
smooth
doppelbock
interpretation
certainly
a
good
surprise
considering
their
same
makers
of
birra
moretti
d
an
ok
beer
but
i
was
found
wanting
more
this
is
no
salvator
but
a
good
solid
beer
nonetheless
one
of
my
first
italian
beers
pretty
interesting
not
a
bad
option
with
an
italian
meal
though
if
it
were
a
little
drier
it
might
balance
out
spices
a
little
more
and
relatively
inexpensive
to
boot
i
wish
la
rossa
was
on
more
italian
restaurant
menus
a
very
pleasant
surpise
to
tell
the
truth
didnt
even
realize
it
was
a
doppelbock
until
i
got
here
got
a
bottle
at
the
local
italian
restaurant
it
pairs
nicely
with
a
good
red
sauce
id
call
this
a
simple
doppelbock
it
comes
off
just
like
a
strong
dark
lager
with
a
rich
caramel
and
licorice
malt
flavor
while
the
flavor
is
anything
but
subtle
its
a
little
bland
and
lacks
complexity
still
not
a
bad
option
when
it
comes
to
italian
beer
available
in
the
burbs
overall
id
order
again
for
being
7
2
the
alcohol
was
not
noticable
the
flavors
of
the
malts
honey
and
a
little
what
seemed
like
choclate
malts
were
evident
and
blended
well
overall
it
is
drinkable
but
it
helps
to
not
think
of
it
as
a
doppelbock
doesnt
fit
the
style
more
of
an
amber
lager
could
drink
several
of
these
but
the
sweetness
is
a
little
too
much
for
me
expect
more
out
of
your
doppelbock
not
bad
tasting
however
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
my
favorite
thing
to
drink
with
a
pizza
d
excellent
for
a
7
malt
bomb
i
could
down
a
few
of
these
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
a
rich
amber
with
medium
white
head
and
nice
lacing
nose
is
malts
and
fruit
good
mouthfeel
and
nice
flavors
of
caramel
and
light
hops
very
nice
to
drink
best
italian
beer
i
have
seen
i
will
have
to
look
for
this
again
d
would
get
again
when
not
out
at
an
italian
restaurant
but
defiantly
would
get
again
if
they
had
this
at
other
restaurants
it
has
the
feel
of
a
doppelbock
but
is
more
drinkable
lighter
in
mouthfeel
but
still
has
that
substantial
flavor
and
the
abv
kick
kind
of
like
a
summer
doppelbock
if
that
makes
any
sense
this
was
cheaper
than
optimator
at
my
local
trader
joes
i
think
this
is
my
new
everyday
doppel
very
drinkable
this
beer
aint
badonce
i
saw
heineken
near
the
same
of
the
beer
i
thought
i
got
sucked
into
some
euro
bmc
i
would
try
it
again
and
i
was
quite
supprised
medium
body
and
very
easy
to
drink
an
italian
surprise
all
six
entries
flexed
their
muscles
but
the
one
from
italy
takes
the
top
prize
read
my
previous
reviews
to
catch
what
you
missed
from
the
euro
invitation
good
night
everyone
might
try
this
one
again
might
not
my
brother
recommended
birra
moretti
and
i
thought
id
try
it
the
make
your
own
6
pack
shelves
at
my
local
store
were
fresh
out
of
it
so
i
opted
to
try
the
moretti
doppelbock
instead
as
beers
go
it
was
good
as
a
dopplebock
it
likely
fell
short
a
few
notches
the
color
was
a
dark
dr
pepper
red
brown
in
the
glass
with
a
surprising
amount
of
carbonation
thin
mouthfeel
and
a
faint
dark
malt
and
alcohol
smell
as
you
raise
the
glass
a
good
dopplebock
will
not
usually
hit
you
in
the
nose
with
alcohol
so
quickly
this
one
did
and
the
moderately
thin
mouthfeel
didnt
do
much
to
make
it
better
i
was
expecting
a
much
more
balanced
taste
but
the
alcohol
seemed
to
almost
overpower
the
flavor
i
liked
it
for
what
it
tried
to
be
but
it
didnt
quite
live
up
to
my
expectations
if
youre
into
dopple
bocksdunkels
give
it
a
shot
worth
a
try
but
i
wont
be
running
out
to
purchase
a
sixpack
of
it
anytime
soon
the
beer
pours
a
very
pretty
rubyred
to
mediumbrown
color
and
the
creamcolored
head
disappears
quickly
the
aroma
is
all
about
the
caramel
malts
and
it
is
what
really
drew
my
attention
to
it
when
i
first
had
it
at
the
old
como
inn
in
chicago
the
flavor
changes
quite
dramatically
with
temperature
at
foodfridge
temps
the
sweet
malts
dominate
to
the
point
of
giving
a
stickysweet
colaish
impression
if
yours
is
served
that
cold
give
it
10
minutes
to
warm
up
once
it
gets
a
little
warmer
the
hop
bitterness
has
a
fighting
chance
against
all
those
malts
aided
by
the
alcohol
warmth
and
dryness
that
starts
to
gets
some
traction
this
beer
never
escapes
all
that
sweetness
but
it
is
more
balanced
at
warmer
temps
it
comes
into
its
own
when
paired
with
minestrone
soup
dishes
with
marinara
sauce
and
other
tomatobased
courses
if
you
are
happy
with
a
sweeter
beer
this
is
very
drinkable
only
the
sweetness
and
eventually
the
physiological
effects
of
the
higher
abv
will
slow
you
down
i
reviewed
this
beer
a
few
weeks
ago
when
it
came
in
a
compilation
box
that
i
purchased
but
i
recently
found
it
in
a
six
pack
and
realized
that
the
taste
was
very
different
no
doubt
that
the
box
that
i
bought
was
old
so
this
review
will
reflect
the
much
fresher
version
pours
a
glossy
brown
color
with
little
to
no
head
the
smell
is
big
with
mostly
dark
malts
dominating
the
nose
the
taste
is
interesting
but
overall
really
big
the
dark
malts
are
apparent
but
also
a
taste
of
candied
sugars
which
give
it
a
sticky
taste
also
there
is
a
hit
of
chocolate
andor
coffee
in
the
end
of
it
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
really
a
terrific
beer
that
is
well
crafted
seek
it
out

you

12
oz
bottle
pours
amber
brown
clear
with
a
light
creamy
head
of
tan
dusty
wheat
aroma
hint
of
caramel
flavor
is
bland
incredibly
watery
sugar
and
chalkboard
malt
flavor
a
hint
of
toast
finishes
this
heer
with
a
few
notes
of
corn
nuts
palate
is
very
watery
but
not
refreshing
instead
sickly
and
a
touch
sticky
this
is
horrible
for
a
bock
drinkability
is
kind
of
iffy
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
much
but
the
sweetness
and
roasted
carmel
aftertaste
could
make
this
a
multiple
drinker
d
very
drinkable
was
almost
like
drinking
a
soda
it
went
well
with
salad
and
calzone
this
is
one
that
id
drink
cold
if
i
were
you
perhaps
i
just
picked
up
a
bad
batch
but
the
levels
of
butterscotch
here
are
almost
unbearable
perhaps
the
italians
myself
being
one
should
stick
to
making
wine
drinkability
this
is
a
quaffable
malty
brew
and
its
definitely
the
best
italian
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
i
still
need
to
try
le
baladin
la
rossa
is
also
cheaper
than
the
good
german
dopplebocks
its
a
good
one
to
pick
up
if
you
see
it
at
tjs
the
drinkability
is
good
not
a
real
bold
or
big
beer
but
quite
respectable
prosit
mk
overall
i
like
this
one
a
lot
try
it
next
time
youre
having
a
pizza
the
combination
is
excellent
this
beer
pairs
well
with
spicy
tomato
based
dishes
considering
how
sweet
this
brew
can
be
better
save
this
selection
for
a
night
cap
this
was
a
unique
beer
i
have
yet
to
experience
this
but
ive
heard
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
to
drink
with
a
pizza
i
bought
one
with
that
activity
in
mind
but
i
just
broke
down
the
other
night
in
a
vain
attempt
to
convince
my
friends
to
order
out
and
drank
the
quaff
by
itself
when
i
poured
it
into
my
special
duvel
chalice
i
immediately
noticed
an
actual
tomato
juice
smell
which
was
very
intriguing
to
me
it
had
an
almost
vintage
ale
sherry
taste
to
it
usually
i
dont
like
those
styles
of
beer
but
this
was
wasnt
as
strong
so
i
was
able
to
toloerate
it
the
color
was
a
nice
reddish
copper
that
looked
very
pleasing
in
the
light
over
all
it
wasnt
a
bad
brew
d
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
a
nice
doppelbock
this
beer
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
nose
is
malty
and
doughy
taste
is
malty
somewhat
doughy
and
finishes
with
a
dark
fruit
hop
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
and
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
i
have
had
this
in
italian
restaurants
before
and
liked
it
glad
i
came
back
to
do
an
official
review
as
this
is
definitely
enjoyable
d
with
the
exeption
of
eisbocks
every
variant
of
bock
i
have
had
is
incredibly
easy
going
down
this
one
is
right
up
there
with
them
quick
forming
head
just
as
quick
to
disassemble
itself
before
a
first
sip
i
was
left
with
nothing
but
a
thin
outside
trim
of
the
glass
ruby
in
the
light
otherwise
chestnut
brown
great
malty
aroma
carbonation
a
little
high
but
no
hint
as
to
the
7
quite
well
hidden
behind
the
malt
flavour
is
too
quick
to
disapear
as
well
a
decent
dopplebock
but
a
little
heavy
on
the
amber
malt
and
showcases
little
else
too
one
dimensional
also
a
lack
of
texture
and
the
failure
in
the
flavour
department
makes
this
all
too
macroish
no
doubt
this
is
just
as
close
to
a
red
as
it
is
dopplebock
no
character
simply
lager
a
fairly
decent
brew
still
but
certainly
held
back
by
characteristicly
macro
qualities
drinkablity
an
exellent
beer
i
would
love
to
try
it
with
pizza
pours
a
dark
rubyred
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
sweet
malts
caramel
and
some
dark
fruits
taste
is
very
sweet
rich
and
creamy
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
present
in
this
beer
detracting
from
the
drinkability
a
bit
overall
i
am
impressed
with
this
brew
who
knew
such
a
good
beer
like
this
could
come
from
italy
drinkability
a
bit
different
from
the
typical
doppelbock
not
as
sweet
and
the
bitterness
on
the
finish
is
surprising
nonetheless
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
that
carves
its
own
niche
and
is
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
brownamber
with
a
moderate
creamy
head
medium
and
creamy
mouthfeel
bitterness
and
a
generous
malting
including
chocolate
malt
mollasses
caramel
dark
fruit
and
i
do
get
nutiness
and
a
drop
of
roast
appropriate
carbonation
a
nice
drinking
thanks
biegaman
overall
i
think
this
is
a
nice
doppelbock
and
quite
drinkable
despite
the
7
2
alc
not
the
best
but
i
think
pretty
solid
d
better
than
expected
this
is
no
celebrator
but
this
beer
greatly
exceeded
the
low
expectations
that
i
unfairly
assigned
it
unlike
celebrator
the
light
character
of
this
one
could
easily
make
it
a
session
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
to
an
amberbrown
with
thin
tan
head
and
okay
lacing
aroma
was
sweet
malty
chocolate
with
some
caramel
as
glass
warmed
hints
of
alcohol
entered
the
smell
flavor
was
more
of
the
malty
wweetness
and
finish
was
smooth
although
not
all
that
long
and
again
alcohol
was
more
pronounced
at
beers
end
good
stuff
ordered
from
carrabbas
not
expecting
much
boy
was
i
surprised
pours
a
dark
cranberry
brown
color
with
a
stead
cascade
of
tiny
bubbles
fueling
a
onefinger
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
decent
lacing
and
a
solid
ring
of
foam
nose
is
very
sweet
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
raspberry
taste
is
extremely
malty
like
a
malty
sweet
caramel
candy
the
malt
is
sweet
but
not
overpoweringly
so
and
soon
fades
to
moderate
hops
mouth
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
tiny
unobtrusive
bubbles
drinkability
is
very
good
its
smooth
good
tasting
and
goes
down
easily
overall
i
recognized
this
beer
almost
immediately
as
a
dopplebock
though
not
the
best
representation
of
the
style
its
definitely
a
solid
goodtasting
beer
recommended
d
a
very
enjoyable
beer
all
the
right
flavors
doesnt
matter
from
which
country
it
originates
id
gladly
get
this
doppelbock
again
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
flavor
as
well
but
with
a
solid
malty
flavor
of
caramel
slightly
smoky
with
a
dark
fruit
sweetness
feel
is
thick
and
slightly
medicinal
finish
is
sweet
and
alcoholic
alcohol
is
slightly
too
prominent
but
its
a
nicely
strong
and
complex
doppelbock
i
wasnt
expecting
this
solid
of
a
beer
perhaps
the
ideas
of
italy
and
dopplebock
seldom
are
paired
in
the
human
mind
but
this
ones
a
fine
example
of
the
style
notes
the
best
italian
brewed
beer
that
ive
had
to
date
i
would
definitely
order
this
brew
and
will
look
for
it
more
often
when
scrambling
to
find
something
decent
to
drink
at
most
italian
restaraunts
reccomended
this
is
an
excellent
dopplebock
a
really
nice
surprise
from
italy
a
definite
rebuy
ive
had
several
italian
beers
and
this
one
is
by
far
the
best
well
at
least
it
was
less
embarrassing
than
the
last
time
i
had
an
italian
beer
also
a
lot
less
memorable
drinkability
i
sure
hope
i
didnt
get
a
bad
bottle
because
this
beer
to
me
really
doesnt
taste
like
a
dopplebock
its
a
good
thing
i
didnt
buy
a
sixpack
of
this
it
was
a
good
beer
but
i
really
dont
like
to
have
hoppy
dopplebocks
drinkabiltiy
this
beer
is
hugely
quaffable
i
was
almost
finished
with
the
three
before
i
had
realized
how
much
i
had
drunk
just
a
yummy
beer
treat
cheers
this
beer
came
in
a
twelve
ounce
brown
bottle
it
poured
an
amber
color
not
quite
red
with
a
thick
head
not
surprisngly
it
smells
like
malt
sure
enough
it
tastes
like
malt
through
and
through
with
just
a
bit
of
hops
to
give
it
some
balance
this
is
a
tasty
beer
not
what
i
expected
from
italy
definitely
worth
a
try
a
nice
little
beer
that
goes
down
pretty
good
for
its
strength
i
do
remember
this
being
a
little
tastier
a
few
years
back
but
still
not
bad
poured
out
a
dark
amber
with
a
2
finger
head
smells
of
a
light
sweet
maltlight
hopssmell
isnt
very
strong
taste
is
pretty
strong
though
taste
of
sweet
maltslight
hoppage
towards
the
end
of
the
sip
alcohol
is
slightly
apparent
but
tamed
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
a
pretty
good
brew
and
i
was
surprised
by
it
seems
like
this
would
be
a
good
companion
to
an
italtian
lunch
all
the
italian
delis
around
here
have
birra
moretti
interesting
take
on
the
ol
dopplebock
1
49
12
oz
i
thought
the
mouth
was
a
bit
thin
for
this
style
but
it
is
a
very
easy
drinker
one
was
not
enough
but
two
was
plenty
i
would
buy
this
one
again
a
perfect
beer
for
a
windy
cool
evening
this
strong
lager
poured
a
deep
red
color
with
a
sustaining
white
head
that
left
some
nice
lacework
down
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
rustic
aroma
is
very
pleasing
with
some
raisinlike
accents
this
is
definitely
a
maltaccented
beer
hopheads
run
away
with
tawny
caramel
malt
flavors
that
linger
on
the
tongue
the
silkiness
of
this
beer
is
reminiscent
of
a
fine
liqeur
with
just
enough
dryness
to
prevent
a
cloying
character
this
beer
may
be
categorized
as
a
dopplebock
but
i
think
of
it
as
more
unique
than
that
sort
of
a
northern
italian
strong
red
lager
as
it
doesnt
seem
as
dark
as
other
dopplebocks
that
ive
sampled
perhaps
im
being
too
technical
this
beer
is
an
old
favorite
of
mine
and
i
was
happy
to
see
it
in
the
cooler
at
my
local
italian
deli
im
looking
forward
to
enjoying
some
of
these
brews
with
some
smoked
chicken
ravioli
i
have
planned
for
dinner
later
in
the
week
i
dont
want
to
overrate
this
since
i
dont
have
any
doppelbocks
to
compare
it
to
that
said
it
is
delicious
i
cant
believe
this
has
a
7
2abv
so
easy
to
drink
a
big
beer
that
is
super
malty
instead
of
super
hoppy
what
an
idea
pours
a
brilliant
mahagony
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
a
light
coating
the
nose
is
nicely
roasted
with
nutty
tones
very
nice
flavor
is
the
same
nutty
slightly
sweet
caramel
very
tasty
brew
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
nice
brew
tasty
but
not
too
big
in
the
flavor
i
like
it
dopplebocks
often
have
too
much
flavor
for
me
but
this
one
works
well
for
me
enjoyable
moderate
malt
presents
in
the
aroma
big
hit
right
off
the
bat
toast
caramel
raisin
and
cherry
are
there
but
had
to
search
brown
with
some
red
highlights
fair
head
flavor
was
lacking
also
it
was
there
but
restrained
very
lively
medium
bodied
alcohol
was
not
hard
to
find
over
all
a
good
beer
but
not
a
good
example
of
the
dopplebock
i
had
this
at
a
fancy
italian
restaurant
it
pours
a
brilliant
red
with
a
modest
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
malty
and
sweet
with
some
peppery
alcohol
evident
the
taste
starts
off
big
and
malty
with
bread
and
toffee
notes
alchohol
quickly
becomes
evident
as
does
a
cloying
sweetness
the
finish
is
thin
sweet
and
highly
alcoholic
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
moderately
carbonated
this
is
not
a
very
good
beer
it
needs
more
malt
depth
and
less
abrasive
alcohol
yummy
you
know
when
a
guy
uses
the
word
yummy
that
he
is
humbled
this
beer
looks
great
chocolatey
dark
with
some
mohogany
colors
light
carbonation
and
tan
head
just
off
from
clear
this
beer
looks
nice
smells
more
fruity
than
expected
in
a
dopple
a
bit
estery
cherries
ripe
oranges
figs
dates
plumbs
mildly
spicy
and
peppery
tastes
quite
malty
caramelly
chocolatey
and
the
same
fruits
that
are
present
in
the
aromas
full
rich
body
carbonation
and
alcohol
keeps
the
beer
from
cloying
or
thickening
alcohol
is
smooth
and
sweet
carboation
plays
on
the
palate
without
numbing
finishes
slick
and
smooth
pours
a
clear
mahogany
attractive
two
finger
head
retains
well
and
leaves
some
seriously
impressive
rings
of
lacing
in
the
glass
bittersweet
malt
aroma
excellent
rich
caramel
malt
flavor
with
dark
fruit
and
just
a
bit
of
smoke
character
hops
come
in
with
mild
bitterness
just
enough
to
balance
and
complement
the
thick
maltiness
delicious
lasting
finish
of
malt
and
fruit
with
mild
alcoholic
warmth
this
was
a
great
find
and
an
extremely
pleasant
surprise
ill
definitely
be
going
back
for
it
when
i
can
opinion
i
think
that
this
is
a
tasty
beer
i
personally
am
spoiled
by
doppelbocks
so
i
think
that
this
one
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
it
blurs
the
boundaries
between
a
doppel
and
a
mai
bock
it
seems
to
me
like
a
fortified
oktoberfest
as
it
does
an
oktoberfest
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
absolutely
worth
a
try
wow
i
wasnt
expecting
this
i
was
thinking
i
would
get
some
sort
of
mild
red
lager
this
one
packs
a
punch
at
7
2
abv
i
was
in
rome
last
summer
and
tried
a
beer
called
ceres
strong
ale
it
tastes
so
much
like
it
it
brings
back
alot
of
memories
this
beer
has
alot
of
malt
taste
and
alot
of
metallic
taste
i
dont
usually
like
it
when
my
beer
tastes
like
steel
nor
do
i
in
this
case
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
ruby
red
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
is
topped
by
a
tan
head
that
is
quite
thick
as
well
as
being
frothy
and
creamy
the
aroma
smells
of
lightly
spicy
hops
caramelized
malt
and
a
hint
of
toasted
grain
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
up
front
but
then
moves
to
a
toasty
caramel
malt
note
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
lingering
toasted
maltiness
that
is
lightly
astringent
overall
this
beer
is
a
celebration
of
malty
notes
this
is
a
fairly
full
flavored
beer
and
at
one
time
was
by
far
the
most
flavorful
italian
beer
with
a
new
wave
of
craft
italian
breweries
though
this
seems
like
a
not
quite
flavorful
enough
bock
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
the
beer
started
off
very
well
balanced
without
over
powering
me
with
any
flavor
whether
it
be
hoppiness
or
too
bitter
i
noticed
a
fairly
strong
alcoholic
taste
and
dry
mouthfeel
at
the
finish
of
it
but
again
nothing
that
detracted
from
my
enjoyment
this
beer
was
big
surprise
for
me
and
i
can
say
that
id
be
willing
to
have
it
again
if
and
when
i
come
in
contact
with
it
its
a
bit
boozy
on
the
palate
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
readily
apparent
for
my
liking
overall
though
its
a
decent
enjoyable
brew
well
worth
trying
medium
doppelbock
bodied
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
solvent
like
alcohol
so
i
was
not
a
huge
fan
ive
read
about
this
beer
before
michael
jackson
calls
it
the
perfect
beer
for
pizza
and
have
had
it
on
many
occasions
and
really
do
enjoy
it
one
of
the
few
italian
beers
that
i
like
not
that
ive
had
that
many
finger
licking
good
doppio
malta
caramel
and
a
spicy
hint
of
hot
sauce
long
lingering
finish
and
even
some
hops
coming
through
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
beer
is
very
fizzy
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
and
i
can
catch
a
definite
whiff
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
quite
complex
malty
dark
fruits
but
it
isnt
my
first
or
second
choice
for
this
general
style

just
by
the
appearance
and
the
way
it
smelled
tons
of

the
taste
a
little

of

i
liked
it
its
not

to
hear
that
people
think
the
italians
dont
know
beer
and
should
sick
to
wine
this
beer
might
change
that
perception
it
had
a
subtle
aroma

was

fresh
and
smooth
but
i
wasnt
expecting
a
doppelbock
poured
out
to
a
nice
dark
amber
in
the
glass
aroma
is
that
of
malt
and
raisins
taste
is
that
of
malt
with
fruit
thrown
in
enjoyable
especially
considering
its
country
of
origin
compared
to
other
dopplebocks
a
couple
of
years
ago
i
was
in
a
pizza
restaraunt
and
the
waitress
came
over
for
our
drink
order
when
she
listed
the
available
beers
it
was
the
usual
sht
except
for
grolsch
amber
ale
id
had
grolsch
before
and
liked
it
but
never
the
amber
she
brought
over
a
swing
top
bottle
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
with
the
pizza
and
could
understand
why
they
had
it
i
never
could
find
the
amber
in
the
swing
top
in
any
stores
when
they
say
that
larossa
is
the
perfect
beer
to
have
with
pizza
or
italian
food
i
can
understand
this
is
a
cross
between
that
amber
ale
and
salvator
it
is
quite
similar
amber
color
malty
sweet
but
not
overly
so
and
quite
a
kick
this
is
a
terrific
beer
hard
to
find
but
seek
it
out
you
will
be
suprised
a
creamy
warming
treat
im
going
to
ask
my
local
italian
deli
who
carry
the
regular
moretti
if
they
can
get
this
for
me

just
needs
a
better
label
to
stand
out
from
the
crowd
i
think
pours
a
brownish
amber
hue
with
a
white
head
tastes
great
i
am
surprised
at
how
much
i
like
this
stuff
great
rich
malty
taste
caramel
toffee
a
little
bit
of
coffee
tones
an
underrated
beer
if
i
have
ever
tried
one
i
would
recommend
this
to
anybody
who
likes
doppelbocks
while
not
a
beer
to
make
a
permanent
commitment
too
shes
not
one
to
be
kept
to
a
onenightstand
either
as
with
all
memorable
affairs
after
a
round
of
la

i
cant
seem
to
get
the
taste
of
her
off

i
know

all
of
this

some
one
has
done
their
home
work
for
sure
on
this
world
class
doppio
malto
beer
i
now
have
a
favorite
italian
beer
and
la
rossa
moretti
is
it
what
a
pleasant
suprise
this
doppel
is
it
pours
out
a
dark
ice
tea
color
with
a
minimal
head
and
no
lace
the
aroma
really
struck
me
as
authentic
italian
not
only
does
it
have
the
obligatory
caramel
malt
and
slightly
boozy
nose
but
a
definite
flare
of
italian
seasonings
such
as
oregano
thyme
tomato
and
pepper
others
have
commented
on
the
out
of
the
oven
pizza
aroma
couldnt
agree
more
anyway
the
mouthfeel
is
right
on
for
a
doppel
thick
but
slick
tastes
very
malty
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
not
only
lots
of
malty
goodness
but
ghostly
hints
of
fruitcake
flavors
alcohol
warms
the
system
way
more
layered
and
complex
than
other
reviewers
have
given
credit
for
this
is
the
ultimate
mega
brew
pairing
for
italian
food
i
have
a
doppel
taste
test
coming
up
and
am
excited
to
see
where
it
might
rank
among
the
mighty
ators
one
of
the
better
brews
ive
tried
lately
and
would
not
hesitate
to
go
back
to
had
this
one
at
the
wonderful
buca
di
beppo
here
in
columbus
it
was
so
nice
to
have
an
italian
beer
that
actually
tasted
good
to
go
with
some
familystyle
italian
food
dark
copper
color
with
a
medium
pizzadough
colored
aroma
why
not
strong
malt
with
slight
alcohol
aroma
the
flavor
was
extremely
malty
even
for
a
doppelbock
as
such
it
was
a
hearty
beer
that
complemented
my
hearty
food
very
nicely
who
knew
italians
produced
doppelbocks
well
apparently
moretti
does
and
they
do
a
good
job
with
it
this
one
pours
a
deep
ruby
color
featuring
a
shortlived
tan
head
nose
is
of
sweet
malts
caramel
and
some
chocolate
taste
is
similar
bordering
more
on
the
sweet
side
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
lingers
in
the
mouth
but
the
caramel
malt
is
definitely
present
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
but
a
bit
thin
to
share
company
with
the
best
fairly
easy
drinking
this
italian
brew
is
a
keeper
drink
up
all
the
time
i
spent
in
northern
italy
and
i
thought
spaten
was
italian
for
beer
where
was

when
i
was
munching
on
my

pours
a
semi
sticky
head
over
translucent
terracotta
nose
of
cannoli
and
a
steamy

you
can

be
drinking
more

blend
the
roasted

improved

flavorwise
this
brew
is

than
the

is
from

adding
toastiness
hop
bitterness
is
above
the
norm
for

and
offsets

it
is
reminscent

highlights
and

that
holds
well
and
leaves

very

the
aroma
is

with
rich
toasty
dark

and
toffee
malt
notes
the
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is

the

toasty
with

some

a
touch

some
minimal

flavor
and
a
solid
bitterness
the
finish
is
dry
and
long
lasting
with
malt
and
hop
flavors
as
well
as
some
residual
bitterness
although
its
not
a
complex
beer
it
is
very
rich
and
engaging
unfortunately
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
apparent
bringing
down
an
otherwise
great
beer
very
unique
in
style
like
a
very
big
vienna
lager
which
makes
sense
because
of
northern
italys
border
with
austria
well
worth
trying
nice
bright
amber
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
that
sinks
down
at
a
nice
pace
nice
caramel
and
biscuity
maltiness
in
the
aroma
of
this
one
but
a
little
weak
smelling
for
the
style
smooth
maltiness
consumes
this
beer
and
it
is
not
quite
as
sticky
sweet
as
a
lot
of
other
examples
of
this
style
which
is
something
that
i
actually
liked
a
little
thin
in
flavor
and
body
however
bringing
those
marks
down
a
bit
the
brew
still
remains
rather
drinkable
however
and
is
one
that
i
wouldnt
pass
up
at
an
italian
place
if
they
were
offering
it
dilemma
do
i
review
this
beer
as
a
doppel
or
as
an
italian
beer
as
a
doppel
id
have
to
say
its
merely
average
which
is
not
bad
mind
you
as
an
italian
beer
however
id
say
this
is
exceptional
deep
redbrown
with
a
nice
thick
head
smell
is
malty
as
heck
quite
sweet
taste
is
a
bit
thin
and
perhaps
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
brown
sugar
caramelized
fruits
there
is
a
certain
outoftheoven
pizza
aspect
to
this
beer
that
i
find
intriguing
though
and
it
does
go
really
well
with
pizza
and
pasta
with
red
sauce
do
you
think
they
planned
it
that
way
i
wont
necessarily
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
beer
but
i
will
order
it
occasionally
when
im
eating
italian
and
maybe
ill
serve
it
at
my
next
pizza
party

red
brew
is
awesome
i
read
some
articles
on
this
and
it
claimed
to
have
a
out
of
the
pizza
oven
aroma
and
it
came
pretty
darn
close
definitely
a
beer
to
try
a
liquid
bread
that
certainly
is
a
savior
the
best
beer
i
have
found
imported
from
italy
and
while
there
for
two
weeks
and
several
cities
not
a
drop
of
this
to
be
found
very
disappointing
apparently
only
made
for
export
good
head
carbonation
dark
but
not
chewy
can
be
savored
the
abv
is
7
2
year
round
thanks
go
out
to
zap
for
nailing
down
this
highly
sought
after
brew
for
me
a
double
malt
doppio
malto
in
every
sense
of
the
term
this
beer
is
strong
from
the
malt
7
abv
and
sweet
from
the
malt
dull
caramel
color
no
head
malty
aroma
full
mouthfeel
the
taste
starts
with
alcohol
moves
to
caramel
and
finishes
with
butterscotch
pretty
much
what
you
would
expect
with
this
much
malt
unless
youve
got
a
real
sweettooth
you
probably
wont
drink
many
of
these

a
rich
orange
in
color
nice
sweet
nose
of
fresh
baked
bread
not
a
thick
doppel
on
the
mouth
flavorful
though
nice
sweetness
kind
of
a
strong
sweet
dark
burgandy
cherry
fruity
taste
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
complex
but
it
is
very
good
hops
are
not
noticable
and
neither
is
the
alcohol
maybe
a
tich
syrupy
sweet
on
the
finish
not
an
alltime
great
but
a
good
solid
beer
nice
ruby
color
with
a
creamy
head
sweet
aroma
loaded
with
malt
and
caramel
rich
and
sweet
creamy
caramel
bitter
chocolate
and
molasses
hops
are
well
balanced
with
the
malt
finishes
slightly
dry
with
a
noticeable
taste
of
alcohol
if
you
like
malt
hopefully
youll
like
this
one
skoal
pours
a
nice
light
brown
or
ruby
red
color
with
a
good
offwhite
head
that
dies
after
a
bit
leaving
a
thin
lace
heavy
malts
in
the
aroma
and
on
the
palate
dark
malts
caramel
slight
toffee
and
hops
which
create
an
ever
so
slight
bitterness
the
7
2
is
hardly
even
noticed
this
was
a
very
well
balanced
brew
and
very
enjoyable
a
db
from
italy
just
too
sticky
and
doughy
malty
for
me
a
bit
thivk
and
cloying
in
the
end
just
didny
appeal
to
my
tastes
in
the
end
if
we
are
to
keep
with
the
doublebock
classification
then
i
put
it
in
the
same
class
as
sam
adams
doublebocka
boozy
amber
smackdown
but
hardly
a
dopple
charmer
a
real
surprise
i
have
never
given
italian
beers
much
thought
but
i
guess
that
this
is
the
exception
that
proves
the
rule
big
malty
rich
flavor
my
new
favorite
beer
with
pizza
very
tasty
italian
version
of
a
doubble
bock
im
glad
to
see
our
distributor
putting
some
marketing
backing
on
this
beer
i
am
holding
out
hope
that
i
will
start
to
see
this
beer
on
tap
around
portland
soon
with
its
rich
matly
goodness
i
can
only
imagine
how
great
it
will
be
on
tap
very
strong
and
not
well
intergrated
in
my
opinion
i
was
not
particularly
taken
with
this
beer
nice
fruity
front
but
then
it
kicked
into
a
candycaramel
malt
sweetness
that
dominated
any
other
flavors
for
such
a
malty
beer
it
seemed
a
little
thin
nothwithstanding
the
big
alcohol
content
it
seemed
less
like
a
bock
and
more
like
an
irish
red
if
you
can
find
this
beer
buy
it
and
enjoy
12oz

solid
winter
enjoyment
for
people
who
want
to
save
a
buck
here
and
there
would
not
purchase
this
beer
again
its
an
interesting
brew
probably
quite
good
if
dopplebocks
are
your
thing
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
certainly
i
want
to
try
more
of
trader
joes
brews
a
great
doppelbock
for
about
a
dollar
a
bottle
othis
beer
was
good
overall
i
liked
this
the
next
doppelbock
i
have
will
definitely
be
measured
against
this
one
im
not
certain
that
i
see
this
as
a
winter
beer
because
it
doesnt
really
scream
winter
at
me
but
it
doesnt
really
have
to
this
beer
could
be
a
good
starter
for
folks
looking
to
get
into
big
beers
because
its
very
easy
on
the
palate
despite
the
higherthanaverage
abv
cold
cold
is
sometimes
enough
o
its
a
decent
doppelbock
though
an
excellent
value
considering
the
1
price
nothing
special
a
good
sweet
and
malty
brew
as
i
finished
this
bottle
of
joesphs
braus

i
thought
damn
i
shouldve
picked
up
a

is

less
aggressive
than
the

everything
from
the
nose
being
represented
oak
vanilla
and
the
breadyness
are
most
dominant
body
is
medium
plenty
of
carbonation
a
touch
dry
which
i
expect
and
gives
down
easy
enough
but
seems
larger
than
its

very
nice
example
and
an
impressive

an
amazing

lingering

bodied
with
a
hint
of
creaminess
an
interesting
take
on
a
doppelbock
and
the
smokiness
was
appropriate
for
the
winter
theme
finish
was
a
bit
attenuated
but
overall
a
pleasant
winter
bock
taste
is
nearburnt
caramel
and
a
touch
of
roast
and
dark
chocolate
not
bad
a
little
on
the
astringent
side
but
not
too
bad
not
sure
how
many
i
could
drink
at
a
time
but
a
nice
affordable
doppel
is
not
always
a
bad
thing
its
better
cold
than
warm
for
what
its
worth
this
one
comes
pretty
cheap
from
trader
joes
and
in
this
case
was
a
gift
it
tasted
about
like
i
expected
it
was
a
solid
dopplebocktype
beer
with
a
little
holiday
spice
mixed
in
to
me
it
is
the
perfect
session
winter
beer
but
i
cant
rate
it
any
higher
than
that
interesting
fairly
complex
malt
flavor
esters
are
a
bit
overly
pronounced
also
a
bit
sweet
and
hot
but
its
a
winter
brew
a
decent
but
sort
of
lack
luster
taste
seems
to
be
missing
something
that
would
make
a
person
search
out
more
of
this
stuff
overall
a
pretty
decent
bock
nice
malt
driven
taste
that
is
pretty
nutty
very
creamy
and
smooth
considering
the
higher
abv
serving
type
bottle
very
drinkable
decently
crafted
and
a
good
value
though
it
lacks
the
depth
of
flavor
that
the
better
examples
of
the
style
exhibit
on
a
consumption
note
this
beer
is
best
served
at
4045
degrees
imo
as
it
warms
the
flavors
and
aromas
open
up
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
soft
carbonation
that
allows
this
to
gently
foam
up
on
the
palate
resulting
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
pillowy
dry
finish
slightly
sticky
from
high
malt
sweetness
ethanol
felt
on
back
of
palate
and
throat
slightly
surprising
for
a
7
5
doppelbock
d
not
bad
the
malt
character
is
nice
up
front
but
becomes
a
bit
cloying
by
the
end
of
the
glass
in
the
end
there
are
much
better
dopplebocks
out
there
than
this
one
overall
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
unpleasant
and
it
was
a
little
too
dry
but
the
aroma
and
malt
presence
is
well
done
low
c
o
not
a
great
beer
but
nice
finish
and
nice
overall
litle
bitterness
in
the
mouth
with
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
for
the
price
thanks
to
my
friend
eddie
from
the
bronx
for
picking
me
up
some
of
this
at
trader
joes
in
ny
overall
i
give
it
a
3
5
well
worth
trying
considering
the

tag
poured
this
doppelbock
style
ale
from
a
12
oz
brown
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
nice
clear
reddish
brown
color
produced
a
nice
tan

great
retention
aroma
was
a
sweet
malty
caramel
scent
full
body
this
ale
was
a
very
nice
surprise
excellent
example
of
the
style
excellent
session
beer
taste
of
toasted
grain
caramel
and
a
very
aggressive
hop
finish
high
in
alochol
leaves
you
feeling
warm
great
brew
for
winter
time
o
it
seems
to
be
an
odd
example
of
this
style
its
not
that
it
is
bad
it
just
seems
unfamiliar
and
medicinal
personally
would
not
purchase
again
esspecially
since
you
can
get
better
offerings
from
trader
joes
for
the
same
price
id
rather
stick
with
the
pale
ale
or
ipa
both
good
examples
of
their
own
respective
styles
made
by
trader
joes
o
all
around
decent
beer
that
i
might
enjoy
more
so
with
a
hearty
meal
than
just
on
its
own
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
makes
for
a
good
companion
on
winter
nights
ill
probably
make
more
purchases
after
realizing
how
affordable
this
is
nice
job
t
for
some
reason
this
tastes
more
than
7
5
mouthfeel
is
a
little
syrupy
and
the
taste
is
almost
like
a
rye
bread
syrup
some
roasted
malt
caramel
brown
sugar
and
yeast
as
well
good
for
the
price
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
1
inch
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
some
fruit
aromas
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
dark
fruits
and
an
interesting
bandaid
flavor
a
slightly
assertive
and
medicinal
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
not
a
very
good
beer
in
my
opinion
based
mainly
on
the
off
bandaid
flavor
coupled
with
the
assertive
hop
bitterness
o
for
a
6
6er
of
dopplebock
its
quite
a
deal
to
style
and
well
made
nowhere
near
the
greatness
of
salvator
or
celebrator
but
at
this
price
point
im
happy
o
not
exactly
an
exciting
beer
but
it
doesnt
taste
terrible
either
the
relatively
high
alcohol
content
was
surprisingly
covered
up
well
dark
brown
with
a
good
two
inches
of
off
white
tan
colored
head
this
faded
and
nestled
own
leaving
a
thin
film
and
some
side
glass
lace
the
smell
was
nce
and
smoky
with
a
bit
of
an
earthy
grain
mixed
in
a
touch
of
some
caramel
and
sweetness
as
well
the
flavor
was
very
tight
crisp
clean
and
efficent
flavor
lots
of
malt
nice
smoky
flavors
with
a
touch
of
caramel
overall
i
guess
if
you
are
picking
something
up
from
trader
joes
and
really
want
it
to
be
trader
joes
brand
this
would
be
an
all
right
one
to
pick
up
everything
is
muted
compared
to
others
of
the
style
but
it
isnt
too
bad
overall
hey
wait
a
minute
wait
just
one
damn
minute
this
is
curiously
reminiscent
of
the
gordon
biersch
winter
bock
emails
to
the
brewery
have
gone
unanswered
pours
cola
brown
light
brown
thin
head
nose
on
the
lighter
side
too
with
lightly
roasted

on
the
palate
the
same
character
is
found
with
light
roasty
malt
flavors
and
some
dark
bread
breadiness
light
bodied
but
not
watery
smooth
very
drinkable
bargain
winter
ale
i
have
found
it
very
drinkable
over
the
years
overall
i
like
it
i
bought
more
and
while
its
available
ill
likely
get
some
more
again
its
not
my
favorite
but
its
a
total
winner
for
the
price
taste
is
slightly
burnt
toast
soaked
in
brandy
with
fermented
dark
raisins
light
sweetness
esp
up
front
with
bitter
spicy
raisin
and
hint
of
alcoholic
heat
taking
over
its
good
in
style
but
not
great
and
its
a
bit
heavy
for
the
simple
character
feel
is
nothing
special
malts
are
also
main
components
of
flavor
but
some
spiciness
as
well
not
very
sweet
overall
and
definitely
not
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
ibu
28
but
plenty
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
flavors
d
not
for
sipping
not
much
taste
here
drink
it
fast
get
a
quick
buzz
i
recommend
drinking
this
one
straight
from
the
bottle
its
a
lot
better
that
way
a
bit
too
metallic
for
me
but
it
is
worth
giving
it
a
go
ive
yet
to
taste
a
very
good
bock
but
i
havent
been
looking
for
one
either
d
for
a
7
5
abv
is
pretty
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
not
as
upfront
as
some
beers
with
that
much
volume
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
its
drinkable
d
i
bought
two
of
these
last
year
drank
one
fresh
and
tossed
this
one
in
to
age
not
sure
id
really
buy
this
one
again
overall
its
a
great
beer
for
the
price
but
theres
many
other
options
if
you
cross
over
to
strong
ales
to
satisfy
your
need
for
big
and
moderate
priced
brews
d
it
has
decent
doppelbock
character
but
it
is
a
bit
incoherent
what
do
you
want
for
a
buck
a
bottle
not
bad
to
try
d
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
at
less
than
6
per
6pack
ive
only
started
trying
out
the
trader
joes
beers
in
the
last
two
weeks
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
have
only
been
impressed
with
the
level
of
quality
for
the
price
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
i
cant
let
the
price
determine
the
drinkability
the
flavor
could
be
more
complex
especially
considering
the
high
abv
to
drink
more
of
something
with
this
much
alcohol
on
a
week
night
i
need
a
good
reason
the
simplicity
leads
me
to
move
to
something
else
that
doesnt
pack
such
a
punch
josephs

was
dark
amber
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
light
tan
head
with
average
retention
and
minimal
lacing
the
smell
was
dark
malt
a
touch
toasty
and
with
toffee
and
caramel
the
taste
was
quite
malty
with
a
little
dark
fruit
a
bit
toasty
it
was
sweet
upfront
and
finished
semidry
the
body
was
medium
with
medium
carbonation
drinkabity
was
above
average
this
is
a
decent
doppelbock
for
a
cheap
price
a
chilled
bottle
is
poured
into
a
glass
mug
the
liquid
is
brown
with
some
ruby
notes
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
are
visible
a
thin
tan
foam
head
was
present
as
i
poured
but
quickly
disappeared
it
now
looks
like
a
mug
of
coke
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
and
full
of
winter
spices
dark
and
chocolate
malts
provide
a
good
base
for
this
beer
some
alcohol
and
bitterness
comes
forward
at
the
finish
it
works
well
and
reminds
you
this
is
a
stronger
beer
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
a
coat
that
is
a
little
bit
sticky
is
left
behind
although
this
beer
is
a
tad
strong
it
drinks
very
easily
i
could
easily
make
my
way
through
a
few
bottles
on
a
cold
winter
night
this
isnt
an
exceptional
beer
but
for
the
price
it
is
very
good
and
worth
checking
out

the

i
good
beer
for

and
with
the
exception
of
a
few
flaws
a
fine
example
of
a
dopple
bock
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
produces
no
head
no
carbonation
to
speak
of
and
no
lacing
the
smell
is
of
carmal
and
malt
sweetness
as
well
as
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
light
to
medium
body
with
drinkability
being
moderate

not
a
bad
brew
but
not

so
much
brett

and
cinnamon
the
taste
runs
very
similar
with
the
addition
of
rye
bread
and
a
stiff
orangepeel
kind
of
bitterness
that
cuts
down
the
spine
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
grainy
feel
overall
a
pretty
nice
dbock
but
the
strange
bitterness
is
not
only
out
of
place
but
also
rather
offputting
beyond
that
this
aint
so
bad
really
12
oz
bottle
from
trader
joes
pours
dark
red
to
brown
with
a
tanned
rocky
long
lasting
head
and
lovely
carbonation
aroma
is
not
very
appetizing
with
piny
hops
and
bready
malt
in
the
balance
taste
is
similar
plus
alcohol
body
is
medium
crisp
and
somewhat
oily
finish
is
long
and
earthy
well
this
is
not
ayinger
celebrator
a
solid
offering
with
the
only
surprise
being
the
off
flavor
d
exceptional
drinkability
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
dangerously
tasty
this
will
stand
up
to
any
of
the
bavarian
imports
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
very
satisfying
and
you
forget
that
for
about
the
price
of
a
bud
you
are
enjoying
a
great
beer
if
you
live
within
20
miles
of
a
trader
joes
this
is
worth
the
drive
also
you
can
mix
and
match
beers
at
tjs
and
create
your
own
six
packs
i
consider
this
is
a
betterthanaverage
doppelbock
and
an
excellent
value
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
glimmering
mahogany
where
the
light
shines
through
a
nice
sized
greyish
tan
head
is
also
impressive
given
how
rarely
doppelbocks
have
a
decent
showing
of
foam
aromas
a
very
sweet
mostly
toffeeish
with
some
dark
fruit
promises
to
very
chewy
as
indeed
it
is
upon
tasting
again
strong
toffee
notes
lots
of
toasted
malts
hints
of
roasted
almonds
has
a
bitterness
on
the
back
end
that
balances
out
the
sweetness
drinkability
i
think
i
like
a
bit
more
of
that
roasted
malt
in
my
doppelbocks
but
this
is
good
i
cant
see
myself
having
more
than
one
in
an
evening
though
drinkability
no
thank
you
d
an
interesting
very
pruny
take
on
the
doublebock
for
a
buck
a
bottle
at
tjs
its
pretty
awesome
hopefully
this
will
encourage
people
to
buy
some
other
doublebocks
it
is
definitely
the
most
adventurous
of
the
tjs
beers
but
definitely
not
the
best
pours
a
middle
brown
color
with
a
sparse
head
not
much
lacing
or
retention
the
nose
is
reasonably
strong
and
spicy
with
notes
of
brew
salts
cardamom
and
cloves
the
taste
is
definitely
bargain
basement
especially
with
the
thin
and
overly
carbonated
mouthfeel
caramel
malt
sweetness
mixes
with
the
munich
malt
sweetness
which
cant
be
overcome
by
anything
the
hops
can
bring
the
spicing
is
high
as
mentioned
and
its
augmented
by
the
peppery
alcohol
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
price
but
im
happy
with
just
one
picked
up
a
single
for
1
at
the
tj
in
brookline
poured
into
pint
glasses
light
brown
in
color
with
a
hint
of
red
sizable
white
head
smell
was
a
bit
spicy
such
as
cinnamon
and
coriander
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
winter
warmer
taste
was
good
but
not
as
intense
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
lager
than
a
doppelbock
mouthfeel
was
also
a
bit
thin
for
me
as
i
like
my
winter
beers
a
bit
more
hearty
also
surprised
to
see
this
beer
at
7
5
abv
not
a
spectacular
beer
but
not
a
bad
choice
at
5
99
a
six
pack
josephs
brau
winterfest
aka
gordon
biersch
winter
bock
is
good
to
the
last
drop
and
has
never
let
me
down
in
the
5
years
ive
been
enjoying
it
so
dont
hate
this
is
a
good
drinkin
quality
beer
the
only
reason
people
wouldnt
like
it
is
because
they
like
bitter
hoppier
winter
warmers
which
this
is
certainly
not
overall
its
not
terrible
but
to
me
it
seems
more
like
a
marzen
or
an
ofest
than
a
double
bock
but
what
do
i
know
brewed
by
someone
somewhere
for
trader
joes
it
isnt
the
worst
beer
in
the
world
and
certainly
worth
the
price
of
5
99
for
a
sixer
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
clear
sienna
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
sorta
fizzy
lot
of
banana
bread
in
the
aroma
with
some
bread
crust
nuts
and
toffee
flavor
is
dark
wheat
bread
earthy
hops
light
fruitiness
tastes
like
it
was
fermented
with
an
authentic
german
yeast
a
little
mineralastringent
character
body
is
too
thin
for
a
doppelbock
and
lets
the
alcohol
come
through
a
bit
one
of
the
better
tjs
beers
though
easily
an
inviting
caramel
amber
color
this
beer
is
delightful
insofar
as
it
has
complex
flavors
including
dark
roasted
grains
a
hint
of
orange
zest
and
maybe
even
some
anise
the
head
resolves
into
a
ring
of
white
around
the
glass
but
dont
let
that
visual
thinness
fool
you
it
is
packed
with
goodness
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
it
can
stand
on
its
own
without
food
but
definitely
goes
well
with
lamb
or
rosemary
flavored
meats
overall
very
drinkable
if
you
dont
imbibe
daily
one
beer
will
be
pretty
effective
and
pleasant
as
far
as
taking
the
edge
off
tastewise
its
much
more
than
just
tolerable
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
i
dont
know
that
ill
get
it
again
i
would
rate
as
a
b
or
a
d
trader
joes
brand
beers
have
been
hit
or
miss
for
me
this
one
is
pretty
much
a
miss
i
dont
think
ill
buy
another
one
of
these
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
body
below
a
thin
off
white
head
aromas
are
strong
bready
malts
prunes
and
little
to
no
hop
presence
the
taste
is
dominantly
malty
with
dark
fruits
and
a
good
malt
backbone
to
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
fluffy
and
full
but
not
thick
in
the
least
bit
though
many
in
this
style
have
a
chocolate
character
ie
ayinger
celebrator
this
one
holds
no
such
flavors
due
to
less
roasted
malts
notes
cant
beat
the
price
especially
for
a
beer
of
this
style
but
im
just
not
a
very
big
fan
i
wont
change
my
original
comments
but
this
is
adjunct
beer
not
bad
yet
a
more
robust
carbonation
would
give
it
more
body
and
allow
for
an
improved
feel
and
drinkability
a
bargain
for
the
price
nonetheless
pours
brown
with
a
good
one
finger
tan
head
modest
amount
of
lacings
aroma
is
figgy
with
a
hint
of
molasses
taste
is
sweet
fruity
with
just
enough
hops
for
support
mouthfeel
is
fine
for
the
style
with
minimal
carbonation
drinkability
is
quite
good
though
at
7
5
abv
it
could
be
a
short
session
this
would
pair
well
with
holiday
foods
a
tasty
beer
at
a
modest
price
prost
taste
a
toasted
malty
sweetness
with
a
quick
caramel
flavor
in
the
middle
that
finishes
of
with
a
slight
bitterness
overall
mouthfeel
was
about
standard
well
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
fairly
drinkable
and
thats
coming
from
someone
who
doesnt
enjoy
the
style
very
drinkable
not
filling
like
belgians
definitely
could
drink
more
than
one
especially
with
cheese
andor
desert
this
is
another
one
from
trader
joes
that
is
allright
but
with
the
huge
selection
of
high
quality
dopplebocks
i
dont
know
if
id
go
back
to
this
but
still
i
cant
rag
on
the
price
it
definitely
isnt
breaking
any
ground
but
if
you
are
on
a
budget
it
could
be
fantastico
a
nice
solid
example
of
the
style
the
best
i
have
had
from
trader
joes
an
outstanding
bargain
at
trader
joes
for
a
buck
i
can
enjoy
this
session
of
a
doppelbock
all
day
especially
knowing
what
i
paid
for
this
clear
ruby
red
with
a
fat
shaving
cream
head
that
leaves
decent
looking
lace
on
the
glass
dark
fruit
toasted
grain
and
toffee
and
german
malt
in
the
nose
tastes
like
it
smells
and
gets
more
complex
as
it
warms
pretty
darn
tasty
but
maybe
just
a
little
thin
bodied
for
the
style
a
steal
for
5
00
a
sixer
at
tjs
d
not
too
bad
of
a
dopplebock
for
the
price
this
is
one
beer
from
trader
joes
that
is
pretty
good
d
this
was
a
pretty
good
i
am
impressed
by
trader
joes
cranking
out
a
pretty
good
dopplebock
all
in
all
very
well
done
and
for
5
99
you
cant
beat
this
my
only
qualm
is
the
high
bitter
units
which
distracted
from
the
malts
rather
than
complementing
them
i
will
go
back
to
this
and
has
made
the
top
of
my
josephsbrau
hit
list
d
a
surprisingly
good
bockplus
from
tjsgordon
biersch
other
than
the
hefty
alcohol
presence
this
is
a
very
good
brew
and
at
that

pick
it
up

actually
one
of
the
best
trader
joes
beers
ive
had
d
notes
a
fine
drinking
beer
for
a
cold
winter
day
while
watching
football
sweetness
does
not
get
in
the
way
of
drinkability
pours
a
dark
brown
with
short
head
and
poor
retention
lacing
is
nonexistent
smells
heavily
of
malts
with
the
lager
background
fits
the
style
pretty
well
tastes
of
a
sweet
roasted
malt
up
front
with
a
slightly
sour
lager
aftertaste
low
carbonation
smooth
body
roasted
malts
stay
with
you
for
a
while
overall
not
bad
at
all
for
a
trader
joes
easy
to
drink
for
a
doppelbock
this
poured
a
clear
cherry
mahogany
with
tan
head
it
smelled
like
strong
roasted
barley
and
earthy
molasses
with
a
bit
of
bitter
chocolate
it
tasted
like
molasses
and
earthy
caramel
and
roasted
barley
with
a
bit
of
copper
hops
it
was
watery
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
nice
clean
malty
beer
with
decent
body
it
was
definitely
easy
to
drink
with
no
noticeable
alcohol
enjoyable
but
nothing
too
exciting
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
syrupy
and
sugary
drinkability
an
average
bock
overall
wouldnt
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
beer
but
if
your
at
trader
joes
it
wouldnt
be
a
bad
buy
d
a
decent
beer
not
one
i
would
look
for
but
one
i
would
drink
if
handed
one
you
get
three
fingers
of
active
biscuity
tan
bubbles
from
the
pour
fades
leaving
no
lace
body
is
a
very
deep
opaque
brown
in
color
nose
is
soft
and
realatively
vague
but
does
have
some
zesty
spicy
notes
along
with
rustic
clay
and
burnt
molases
taste
is
consistant
with
the
nose
with
added
dark
fruit
including
dark
black
cherry
dark
burnt
malt
carries
some
sweetness
and
over
shadows
the
soft
spices
mouthfeel
is
dusted
with
spice
and
slightly
thick
nicely
drinkable
this
is
the
way
a
doppelbock
should
taste
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
one
price
was
great
too
99
cents
for
a
single
surprisingly
this
seems
to
be
an
decent
version
of
the
style
the
first
few
bottles
i
had
a
couple
months
ago
didnt
impress
me
very
much
but
this
is
actually
pretty
solid
the
price
is
right
especially
when
tjs
is
trying
to
sell
off
their
winter
stock
for
something
like
3
00
a
six
pack
nothing
off
though
thankfully
at
7
5
its
held
up
nicely
its
probably
obvious
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
beer
ive
tried
two
now
and
came
away
with
the
same
impression
its
worth
a
try
especially
at
its
price
point
but
ive
had
enough
and
will
move
on
drinkability
yeah
go
for
it
good
value
easy
to
put
a
few
back
d
great
if
you
may
be
constipated
all
kidding
aside
seems
like
trader
used
an
illadvised
yeast
for
this
concoction
not
bad
but
not
a
doppelbock
a
good
doppelbock
that
has
reminded
me
that
i
almost
never
drink
bocks
doppelbocks
or
even
lagers
anymore
kind
of
a
shame
apparently
id
missed
them
certainly
not
bad
for
less
than
a
buck
on
clearance
of
course
remember
its
cheap
but
itll
catch
up
with
you
part
of
a
bock
tasting
this
one
comes
right
after
another
trader
joes
that
was
a
big
disappointment
this
one
will
keep
my
options
open
for
this
contract
beer
well
done
d
respect
to
tjs
and
their
braumeister
joseph
brau
nice
that
they
gave
this
style
a
shot
its
2
less
than
da
optimator
but
if
you
have
2
to
spare
id
opt
for
the
german
to
put
it
plainly
the
flavor
is
too
sweet
its
not
necessarily
bad
but
theres
just
not
a
good
balance
here
caramel
malts
and
candied
sugars
overpower
any
traces
of
hops
while
an
illtimed
alcoholic
sting
coats
the
sides
and
back
of
the
palate
something
is
just
off
about
the
carbonation
level
too
as
this
beer
leaves
the
mouth
dry
sticky
there
is
a
decently
hoppy
finish
however
but
its
far
too
little
too
late
overall
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
unless
you
were
looking
for
a
cheap
dopplebock
to
try
for
the
most
part
you
get
what
you
pay
for
at
trader
joes
this
is
nothing
extra
special
but
it
is
a
tolerable
affordable
dark
beer
so
thats
something
right
there
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
bocks
actually
pretty
drinkable
but
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
so
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
two
in
a
row
probably
a
decent
beer
especially
for
the
price
and
i
would
buy
again
this
beer
had
a
slightly
yeasty
aroma
coming
off
a
very
modest
head
the
dark
amber
lager
is
crisp
and
subtly
sweet
it
seems
to
have
potential
but
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
it
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
particularly
good
either
apparently
this
is
brewed
by
gordon
biersch
it
seems
like
trader
joes
could
do
better
d
nice
looking
and
tasting
doppelbock
nothing
remarkable
but
for
5
and
whatever
a
6
pack
at
trader
joes
well
worth
having
around
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
easily
nice
solid
effort
perhaps
it
lacks
the
complexity
of
some
of
the
elite
examples
of
the
style
but
it
still
provides
that
solid
malt
character
that
we
all
know
and
love
plus
its
cheap
like
all
of
these
tj
brews
at
around
five
bucks
a
sixer
so
you
really
cant
go
wrong
if
you
like
malty
beers
and
live
near
a
trader
joes
i
suggest
picking
some
up
recommended
d
great
drinkability
alcohol
is
not
too
strong
and
the
flavors
are
not
too
thick
the
flavor
is
not
nearly
as
week
as
the
aroma
made
me
thought
it
would
be
it
is
perhaps
not
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
but
is
certainly
a
good
example
and
much
better
than
others
i
have
had
body
is
a
tad
on
the
light
side
for
a
dopple
but
there
is
no
trace
of
alcohol
and
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
certainly
not
bad
for
the
price
which
is
true
of
almost
all
of
tjs
house
brands
tjs
winterfest
dark
double
bock
lager
is
a
userfriendly
doppelbock
that
has
no
shortage
of
complexity
i
dont
usually
go
crazy
over
the
lighter
versions
of
this
style
but
this
one
hit
me
just
right
i
have
no
trouble
believing
that
this
stuff
flies
off
the
shelves
each
autumn
thanks
for
the
quality
extra
talisker
trader
joes
is
a
great
place
to
find
little
gems
like
this
at
5
996
pack
brewed
in
style
that
is
usually
much
more
expensive
winterfest
is
a
very
nice
take
on
the
dopplebock
appearance
is
similar
to
a
carbonated
iced
tea
but
not
cloudy
smell

of

winterfest
dark
doublebock
lager
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
thick
foamy
head
beer
appears
clear
but
slightly
syrupy
and
lacing
is
well
developed
smell
is
malty
with
some
sour
overtones
that
detract
from
the
overall
aroma
however
there
is
a
very
nice
caramel
aroma
beyond
the
sourness
taste
is
very
malty
but
the
overall
character
is
somewhat
muted
its
not
bad
but
i
expected
more
pronounced
flavors
mouthfeel
is
generally
flat
sticky
and
unappealing
this
would
benefit
from
a
little
more
carbonation
overall
winterfest
dark
doublebock
lager
is
drinkable
but
this
beer
could
use
a
little
more
flavor
and
carbonation
to
offset
some
of
its
bland
characteristics
the
complexity
is
nice
but
i
just
cant
get
over
this
mild
sweaty
quality
and
the
parchedness
somehow
its
still
quite
drinkable
though
drinkability
is
a
big
pass
me
something
else
after
one
of
these
i
have
had
outstanding
bock
beers
and
this
is
certainly
not
one
of
them
sure
i
would
pick
this
over
a
budweiser
but
not
over
an
everyday
regular
craft
beer
like
a
sam
adams
lager
not
something
i
would
really
recommend
mediumfirm
pour
into
a
goblet

minimal

poured
cold

seems
like
this

i
allow
it
to
warm

exhibits
a
slightly
metallic
tang
sweet
tangy
and
slightly
bitter
at
first
along
with
a
slightly
unctious
quality
fairly
bitter
bitterness
lingers
and
does
a
great
job
of
offsetting
the
almost
intense
malt
sweetness
notes
of
caramel
and
fruit
which
are
evident
in
the
nose
are
all
but
prominent
on
the
palate
and
there
are
some
light
honey
notes
that
linger
nicely
appearing
just
after
the
lingering
hop
bitterness
seems
a
little
bit
thin
but
the
mouthfeel
begins
to
come
around
as
the
bold
fruity
malt
notes
are
accentuated
by
the
type
of
oiliness
that
i
appreciate
in
this
style
alcohol
is
warming
to
be
sure
but
not
overwhelming
drinkability
is
very
good
even
dangerously
so
overall
a
very

its
enjoyable
if
not
a

on
the
boring
side
make
sure
its
not

you

poured
into

beer
paired
very
well
with

with

medium
carbonation
you
can
taste
the
dark
and
caramel

i
couldnt
taste
the
alcohol
its
not
bad
for
a
tjs
brew
mouthfeel
is
good
but
a
little
light
for
the
style
drinkability
is
okay
you
could
probably
have
more
than
one
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
it
smells
like
caramel
and
smoke
but
not
much
else
as
the
aroma
isnt
strong
at
all
it
tastes
like
roastedsmoked
malt
caramel
and
dark
fruit
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
a
little
bit
slick
drinkability
is
ok
but
not
great
its
an
ok
beer
but
there
are
much
better
dopplebocks
out
there
but
with
that
being
said
id
try
this
again
its
not
bad
dark
brown
traces
of
light
red
in
color
a
light
head
that
dwindles
into
a
nonmoving
ring
that
clings
to
the
edge
of
the
snifter
dark
malts
large
sniffs
of
alcohol
and
some
rye
toasted
bread
on
the
nose
defines
the
style
from
the
start
medium
carbonation
thick
and
creamy
munich
malts
and
caramel
coupled
with
dark
chocolate
roasty
malts
traces
of
english
like

with
some
chestnut
and
dark

flavorings
medium
bodied
with
obvious
intense
just
mentioned
flavorings
during
warming
very
sweet
and
clean
doppelbock
and
a
darn
fine
offering
from
tjoes
go
get
some
a
good
imitation
of
a
doppelbock
but
just
that
an
imitation
theres
no
head
or
lacing
after
the
first
few
minutes
but
the
aroma
is
quite
enticing
and
makes
up
for
the
appearance
has
definite
bocklike
aromas
and
flavors
with
rich
caramel
and
a
bit
of
fruit
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
odd
but
its
still
fairly
drinkable
worth
a
try
the
mouth
is
clingy
and
medium
bodied
this
is
a
great
sipper
and
went
well
with
the
hardy
food
i
was
having
i
did
not
notice
much
alcohol
so
the
brewer
did
a
good
job
of
masking
the

drank
this
from
a
12

bottle
from

slight

very
small
white

almost
no

smells
of
dark
toasted

very

and
even
meaty

a

tastes
very
much
the
same
toasted

hints
of

slight

to
it

very
little
taste

a
little
bite
from
the

a

watery
for
a
doppelbock
easily
drinkable
and
a
good
beer
it
could
just
use
more
complexity
to
it
963
i
got
this
as
an
added
bonus
on
a
trade
with
david
eddie
i
poured
it
into
a
flute
glass
and
it
didnt
have
very
good
head
and
retention
it
is
decent
it
has
a
great
smell
it
has
a
decent
flavor
with
a
lot
of
malts
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
overbearing
but
it
is
fairly
balanced
for
the
style
this
beer
has
decnt
drinkability
but
it
is
nothing
spectacular
im
still
happy
that
i
tried
it
though
md
rather
sweet
and
creamy
nice
and
smooth
especially
for
a
higer
abv
a
nice
doppelbock
though
i
am
doppelbock
spoiled
in
ct
the
land
of
the
liberator
but
this
is
decent
picked
up
a
sixer
in
chagrin
falls
while
visiting
family
over
the
holidaze
mouthfeel
a
bit
on
the
light
side
of
the
spectrum
rather
creamy
drinkability
its
not
my
favorite
style
and
its
not
a
particularly
great
example
so
im
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
minimal
initial
aroma
poured
a
crystal
clear
ruby
brown
color
with
a
rich
tight
bubbled
lingering
pale
tan
head
malty
with
maybe
a
bit
of
plum
or
fruitcake
in
the
up
front
sweetness
despite
the
maltiness
it
is
not
a
cloying
sweetness
wont
say
it
finishes
dry
but
doesnt
linger
back
there
forever
and
as
the
beer
is
very
clean
tasting
and
nice
any
linger
is
pleasant
mouthfeel
no
more
than
medium
and
is
perhaps
a
little
light
for
the
style
however
it
is
a
darn
easy
drinking
7
5
abv
beer
and
at
5
49
per
6
pack
it
is
well
worth
a
look
slainte
a
good
dopplebock
but
im
used
to
something
a
little
thicker
fuller
bodied
than
this
one
but
at
less
than
6
a
six
pack
at
trader
joes
its
a
good
one
to
try
well
done
tjs
or
gb
or
banana
bread
seriously
the
appearance
has
a
medium
amber
colour
to
it
the
head
is
light
the
smell
is
hoppy
the
taste
has
a
caramel
flavour
to
it
thought
it
is
light
that
what
i
would
expect
for
a
7
5
beer
later
on
the
taste
and
the
alcohol
catch
up
with
you
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
disappointing
i
can
only
feel
the
alcohol
in
it
considering
that
this
beer
was
only
92
centsbottle
at
trader
joes
it
is
a
good
deal
i
wouldnt
go
out
and
get
it
however
if
someone
gave
it
to
me
as
a
gift
then
i
would
accept
i
wasnt
terribly
impressed
with
this
one
poured
a
clear
reddishbrown
pretty
average
for
the
style
not
much
head
but
there
are
some
patches
of
sand
coloured
foam
smell
is
very
subtle
there
are
sweet
malts
present
but
theyre
so
faint
so
much
of
a
good
doppelbock
is
great
aroma
to
me
i
love
the
powerful
caramelroasted
malt
smell
that
so
many
have
this
is
nearly
bereft
of
this
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
a
halfway
decent
caramel
malt
flavour
which
is
quickly
overpowered
by
a
pretty
offensive
bitterspicy
hop
flavour
quite
spicy
actually
this
would
be
a
great
attribute
in
another
beer
but
not
a
doppelbock
and
clearly
from
what
i
am
gathering
not
this
doppelbock
mouthfeel
is
fairly
average
and
on
target
for
the
style
overall
im
am
delighted
that
i
didnt
spend
money
on
this
thing
as
i
always
say
though
i
am
glad
that
i
was
given
the
chance
to
at
least
try
it
out
not
for
me
d
a
solid
dopplebock
espeically
for
the
price
i
found
some
of
the
flavors
a
bit
harsh
especially
when
compared
to
other
examples
such
as
salvator
but
im
not
complaining
too
much
a
clear
very
dark
amber
pour
with
just
a
bit
of
tarnished
redness
at
the
edges
very
little
head
from
the
first
bottle
at
least
though
lazy
effervescence
persists
nose
is
stronger
than
expected
and
is
highlighted
by
caramely
malts
with
a
bit
of
roastiness
alcohol
notes
are
pretty
noticeable
too
invoking
something
like
cherry
brandy
to
me
i
was
surprised
by
the
hoppy
bite
of
the
taste
which
offset
the
malts
more
than
i
expect
for
this
style
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
oily
too
but
not
overly
clingy
one
bottle
was
enough
for
now
but
i
wont
have
trouble
finishing
the
sixpack
not
what
i
expect
for
a
doppelbock
but
a
decent
beer
in
its
own
right
this
beer
pours
a
dark
red
color
with
almost
no
head
the
smell
is
a
strange
mixture
of
dark
malts
and
the
aura
of
carbonation
the
taste
is
big
much
bigger
than
i
would
have
expected
from
a
beer
brewed
by
trader
joes
malts
are
without
a
doubt
the
dominant
flavor
in
fact
its
hard
to
tease
out
any
other
taste
to
it
you
can
tell
that
the
beer
would
be
sticky
if
it
were
spilled
if
you
can
imagine
what
that
tastes
like
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
for
the
price
it
cant
be
beat
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
beyond
that
a
great
looking
beer
and
for
the
price
probably
not
a
bad
deal
overall
impression
rich
and
flavorful
a
very
nice
example
of
a
doppelbock
well
balanced
creamy
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
for
4
99
a
six
pack
this
is
a
hell
of
a
bargain
a
quaffable
doppel
for
sure
im
sure
the
7
5
could
sneak
up
on
you
quite
easily
this
beer
has
notes
of
big
toasty
malt
sweet
almost
chocolately
with
a
nice
touch
of
alcohol
an
absolute
steal
for
4
996
pack
poured
a
syrupy
stream
into
a
clean
beer
glass
and
imagined
some
hot
pancakes
underneath
would
be
a
fitting
palatecleanser
but
despite
its
sugarythick
appearance
it
produced
a
pretty
head
nice
reddishbrown
body
and
stick
my
nose
in
i
smell
cherry
candy
dissolved
in
oolong
tea
already
i
feel
a
bit
green
around
the
gills
into
the
mouth
it
discovers
a
sweet
and
peppery
amalgam
of
thick
liquid
zantac
flavored
with
things
that
dont
sound
appealing
like
rose
hips
and
chamomile
perhaps
if
i
were
a
starving
monk
enduring
the
days
of
lent
i
might
be
more
charitable
towards
this
liquid
bread
but
as
it
is
i
need
a
hamonrye
sandwich
to
abrade
my
tongue
and
get
this
strong
sweet
brew
off
my
taste
buds
if
this
beer
review
doesnt
make
sense
i
wrote
it
after
full
consumption
of
the
7
5
abv
brew
whew
onedimensional
but
still
a
good
anchor
for
this
style
i
wonder
how
a
blind
tasting
would
go
im
always
more
impressed
with
this
than
id
expect
its
a
solid
entry
in
this
style
i
wonder
if
im
approaching
this
from
snobby
leveldont
know
still
i
like
this
dobblebock
for
the
price
its
superior
dark
crimson
color
with
a
nice
cascading
foaming
tan
head
not
too
much
lacing
aroma
is
yeasty
and
toasty
a
bit
of
caramel
in
there
as
well
taste
is
more
roasty
than
sweet
malts
seem
to
be
slightly
lacking
but
theres
tons
of
smoky
alcohol
elements
caramel
and
figs
are
noticeable
and
the
finish
leaves
me
with
a
coating
of
dark
fruits
but
it
seems
like
the
malts
were
all
used
for
the
yeast
nothing
was
left
over
body
is
medium
with
medium
carbonation
nice
drinkability
and
definitely
worth
the
84
i
paid
for
it
next
time
i
am
getting
many
more
trader
joes
is
the
shit
i
have
a
few
samples
of
their
other
beers
to
try
its
such
a
good
deal
if
theyre
any
good
at
all
and
i
would
like
to
try
a
different
batch
of
this
it
really
was
good
right
up
until
the
finish
batch
wf006

ibus
according
to
the
bottle
pours
a
rubychestnut
color
very
clear
very
fizzy
as
the
white
head
disappears
immediately
lots
of
streaming
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
roasty
caramel
and
fruity
aroma
caramel
toffee
flavor
very
smooth
very
little
bitterness
not
roasty
or
robust
enough
for
my
taste
carbonation
is
much
lower
than
i
thought
from
all
of
the
fizz
thin
mouthfeel
this
falls
short
of
a
dopplebock
but
does
have
a
good
flavor
you
cant
really
beat
the
price
so
this
is
worth
a
shot
this
isnt
exactly
what
id
call
a
doppelbock
but
anyhow
pours
out
to
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
that
is
relatively
clear
nice
lacing
but
lower
than
normal
carbonation
aromas
of
malts
and
chocolate
dominate
with
some
caramel
in
the
background
taste
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
robust
overall
character
flavors
of
caramel
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
some
warming
alcohol
go
fine
together
but
remain
oddly
out
of
place
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
was
thin
with
a
touch
of
warming
due
to
the
higher
alcohol
level
average
drinkability
not
bad
but
not
for
me
pours
an
opaque
brown
with
a
nice
head
that
dissapated
to
a
few
champagne
bubbles
nose
was
full
of
sweet
malts
nicely
perfumed
taste
is
heavy
of
toasted
malts
with
a
slightly
sweet
small
hopped
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
what
i
would
expect
from
the
style
it
is
decently
carbonated
and
is
keeping
my
palate
interested
drinkability
is
ok
abv
is
well
hidden
this
one
grows
on
you
as
the
heavy
toasted
malts
are
very
overwhelming
at
first
definitely
worth
a
try
at
this
price
jen
okay
so
this
is
a
complete
value
although
it
may
lack
in
originality
it
does
stand
true
for
a
double
bock
it
has
a
high
roasted
malt
flavor
that
is
caramelly
sweet
but
not
sicky
sweet
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
accompanies
this
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
it
ends
with
a
very
mild
hop
taste
just
enough
to
notice
them
for
the
this
is
a
must
have
if
you
live
near
a
tjs
bottle
dated
uf001
pours
a
halffinger
light
brown
head
like
light
brown
sugar
that
quickly
settles
clear
dark
amber
liquid
that
is
a
really
gorgeous
color
smells
caramel
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
mild
bock
character
tastes
caramel
with
a
fusel
alcohol
bite
dark
grains
are
way
underneath
and
come
across
as
dry
cocoa
and
a
tinge
of
black
soured
grains
no
hops
to
my
palette
in
taste
or
bitter
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
rough
and
may
be
hiding
them
md
body
and
modestly
carbonated
nice
to
look
at
but
mediocre
in
taste
at
4
99
its
a
great
bargain
ive
gone
through
a
few
6
packs
of
these
each
time
i
only
had
one
of
these
and
moved
on
certainly
worth
picking
some
up
if
your
tjs
has
it
in
stock
nice
mahogany
brown
colured
with
a
large
super
dense
frothybubbly
dark
tan
head
the
aroma
is
of
course
very
malty
and
quite
pleasant
with
some
funky
milk
chocolate
aspects
good
dark
roasted
malt
taste
with
a
nice
dark
fruity
end
quite
good
on
the
palate
smooth
with
a
grt
long
lasting
bitter
fruit
aftertaste
a
good
american
attempt
at
a
doppelbock
not
as
good
as
most
available
german
examples
but
again
a
great
bargain
beer
from
the
bottle
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
and
no
lacing
aroma
roasted
malts
caramel
sugar
molasses
a
little
chocolate
flavor
roasted
malts
chocolate
plums
brown
sugar
some
hops
mouth
feel
was
a
little
thin
but
not
to
bad
of
a
beer
d
not
too
shabby
this
is
a
sure
thing
for
5
29
a
6pack
though
after
one
bottle
i
feel
like
i
need
to
switch
to
something
else
i
dont
have
many
doppelbocks
to
compare
it
to
but
for
my
tastes
this
is
a
solid
pick
pours
a
dark
mahogany
brown
under
two
fingers
of
khaki
head
nose
limps
out
of
the
glass
with
soggy
beef
jerky
and
smoke
taste
is
smoky
and
metallic
with
some
earthy
peat
and
faint
baltic
prune
mouthfeel
is
frothy
and
thick
wasnt
really
a
fan
of
this
the
funky
jerky
just
didnt
sit
well
with
me
not
sure
if
it
was
a
bad
bottle
but
im
in
no
rush
to
seek
it
out
again
overall
reminds
me
a
lot
of
moretti
larossa
a
very
sweet
malty
beer
with
a
dry
hoppy
finish
very
tasty
highly
recommended
based
on
the
price
and
availability
overall
a
new
addition
to
the
previous
staple
four
trader
joes
brewing
co
beers
that
i
picked
up
earlier
in
the
year
i
actually
enjoyed
this
offering
not
so
sure
about
the
style
designation
but
that
never
worries
me
though
it
may
fall
short
if
compared
to
the
moniker
by
others
more
of
a
dark
winter
warmer
lager
for
me
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
get
a
6pack
and
not
a
single
poured
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
small
head
of
tan
colored
foam
that
dissipated
fast
but
left
some
rings
around
the
pilsner
glass
it
had
a
light
aroma
of
of
only
sweet
chocolate
malts
typical
dopplebock
smell
but
was
a
bit
lighter
in
the
smell
than
most
the
taste
was
strong
with
chocolate
malt
and
nothing
else
not
very
complex
and
good
none
the
less
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
but
went
down
nice
and
smooth
it
didnt
even
bother
to
hide
its
alcohol
content
of
7
5
overall
this
made
for
a
nice
decent
cheap
dopplebock
that
you
can
get
for
5

a
six
pack
this
happened
to
be
my
first
trader
joes
beer
well
not
a
bad
brew
a
trader
jos
opened
up
down
the
street
the
other
day
this
brew
was
nice
need
to
check
out
the
others
i
was
amazed
that
a
beer
from
a
grocery
store
would
be
so
drinkable
but
then
it
is
trader
joes
my
wife
brought
a
sixer
of
this
home
for
me
and
i
ignored
it
for
a
few
days
because
i
didnt
have
much
hope
after
cracking
one
open
and
pouring
it
however
i
decided
it
looked
and
smelled
quite
good
smell
was
malty
and
sour
had
a
bit
of
a
bite
and
was
not
nearly
as
heavy
as
i
expected
probably
was
too
cold
at
the
point
when
i
drank
it
and
i
noticed
the
taste
improved
as
the
glass
warmed
up
willing
to
try
other
trader
joes
beers
now
an
appealing
beer
overall
its
just
too
light
for
a
doppelbock
overall
a
decent
offering
from
tjs
one
never
knows
with
this
store
this
one
is
ok
this
was
my
first
time
trying
a
trader
joes
beer
and
its
good
the
price
is
really
worth
noting
as
is
the
smooth

6pack
pours
a
deep
amber
with
loads
of
carbonation
streams
short
quickly
thinning
head
of
sandy
colored
and
small
bubbles
which
thins
to
a
brief
collar
leaving
no
lacing
smells
slightly
sweet
and
modestly
malty
with
raisins
plums
and
almost
jammy
the
taste
is
also
initially
sweet
and
finishes
with
notes
of
alcohol
raisins
and
plums
along
with
hints
of
clove
are
also
present
light
body
for
a
dopplebock
and
a
rather
thin
mouthfeel
didnt
seem
quite
to
style
but
was
still
enjoyable
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
look
forward
to
another
one
subtle
hints
of
plum
chocolate
work
their
way
around

a
bit
of
caramel
finished
off
dry
with
some
german
hop
flavours
peaking
out

earthy

this
doppelbock
will
not
wow
anyone
however
that
is
to
say
that
it
isnt
bad
the
price
cant
be
beat
either

pk
this
is
a
very
good
beer
from
trader
joe
what
would
you
exspect
from
a
grocery
store
the
color
was
a
dark
brown
with
very
little
foam
and
lace
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
filled
the
nose
with
a
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
of
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
toffee
was
evident
there
was
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
tart
and
sourness
on
my
tongue
and
palate
not
a
great
beer
but
i
would
say
upbove
average
all
you
have
to
do
is
keep
an
open
mind
drinkablilty
is
well
at
4
99
should
be
okay
in
my
book
but
this
wasnt
a
very
drinkable
beverage
i
have
tried
other
bocks
and
they
seemed
to
do
this
style
a
bit
better
yes
this
would
be
better
than
a
malt
liquor
or
bland
lager
for
flavor
but
compared
with
its
style
not
good
tried
one
of
these
beers
that
my
dad
offered
me
from
his
6pack
poured
a
toffeish
brownblack
smelled
like
licorice
with
vanilla
notes
a
decent
amount
of
malty
sweetness
followed
by
the
welcomed
bubble
of
cold
lagered
carbonation
to
help
the
flavor
along
although
i
wasnt
expecting
this
dopplebock
to
be
up
there
withe
ayinger
celebrator
but
for
a
7
5
beer
the
overall
flavor
scheme
was
subdued
not
up
to
my
expectations
but
would
definetly
buy
this
beer
though
notes
i
was
hoping
that
this
winterdopple
would
have
some
spicescinnamoncloves
or
something
but
it
ended
up
being
just
a
sub
par
dopple
that
has
issues
all
around
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
little
bubble
activity
smells
of
pretty
deep
malt
and
chocolatecaramel
hits
of
fruit
are
also
present
pretty
nice
aroma
tastes
surprisingly
nice
there
is
a
deep
roasted
malt
flavor
definite
presence
of
chocolate
and
caramel
a
bit
of
hop
presence
as
well
most
impressively
there
is
not
any
hint
of
high
abv
in
the
mouth
winterfest
is
low
on
carbonation
and
high
in
body
and
flavor
a
pretty
bitter
kick
at
the
end
of
the
swallow
completes
its
composition
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
from
g
bt
js
typical
for
the
style
but
pretty
smooth
and
tasty
and
did
i
mention
what
a
bargain
it
is
ill
pick
up
a
sixer
next
time
at
the
behest
of
my
wife
if
there
were
a
value
column
this
would
get
a
5
all
the
way
overall
overall
not
a
bad
beer
id
think
it
shades
more
into
the
bock
category
than
a
doppelbock
but
its
tasty
nonetheless
its
a
doppelbock
that
tastes
like
a
doppelbock
i
think
this
beer
needs
to
be
reclassified
as
a
bock
instead
of
a
dopplebock
i
personally
would
have
rated
it
much
higher
if
that
were
the
case
review
is
optional
why
is
this
site
not
working
right
flavor
reveals
a
sweet
toasted
malt
backbone
fairly
rich
with
toffee
notes
fruity
specialty
malt
notes
are
subtle
but
add
depth
nice
example
of
the
style
its
just
a
touch
too
sweet
amazing
beer
one
of
my
all
time
favourites
absolutely
delicious
its
no
wonder
this
won
a
silver
at
gabf
its
really
that
good
just
like
all
of
their
beers
moerlein
doesnt
disappoint
with
this
doppelbock
earthy
nutty
malt
backbone
with
a
deep
brown
color
ooverall
very
nice
reminds
me
of
celebrator
b
867
i
poured
this
wonderful
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
boy
wish
i
could
get
more
of
this
one
the
beer
had
a
nice
caramel
taste
to
it
the
beer
was
terrible
looking
and
poured
no
head
at
all
i
was
going
to
swear
it
was
flat
until
i
tasted
it
the
beer
is
a
little
sweet
but
not
too
bad
for
me
this
truly
was
a
surprise
find
and
i
would
certainly
buy
it
again
o
im
not
particularly
inclined
to
have
another
this
is
by
far
the
best
offering
ive
had
from
moerlein
theyve
knocked
it
out
of
the
ballpark
with
this
beer
no
pun
intended
sorry
reds
joke
definitely
pick
this
up
if
youre
into
the
maltheavy
styles
overall
a
decent
doppelbock
that
is
malt
centric
and
easy
to
consume
overall
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
flavor
profile
but
i
think
it
needs
some
carbonation
to
wake
up
the
palate
moreover
i
think
it
lacks
the
complex
maltiness
and
chewy
mouthfeel
that
the
best
dopplebocks
e
g
ayinger
celebrator
have
still
a
good
beer
that
im
proud
to
call
local
id
love
to
try
this
on
tap
o
tasty
if
youre
in
the
mood
better
than
the
spaten
optimator
in
my
opinion
dark
red
beer
with
a
soapy
tan
head
wonderful
smoky
floral
and
spice
aromas
with
some
fruit
and
bread
notes
flavors
of
creamy
caramel
spice
fruit
and
hints
of
brown
sugar
a
very
complex
very
enjoyable
brew
with
a
very
rich
body
definitely
not
a
beer
that
can
be
consumed
in
mass
quantities
d
kind
of
simple
would
get
boring
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
its
well
made
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
good
flavor
profile
worth
getting
sometime
to
try
poured
a
deep
dark
russet
brown
with
a
small
maybe
an
inch
or
so
of
off
white
head
grazing
over
the
top
of
it
there
was
significant
side
glass
lace
throughout
the
session
and
the
overall
look
of
it
was
quite
thick
the
aroma
was
of
slight
smoked
variety
a
little
bit
of
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
caramel
to
sweeten
in
up
the
taste
was
remarkably
smooth
and
delicious
great
full
body
on
this
one
definitely
not
thin
nice
and
mellow
smoky
flavor
with
a
huge
earthy
and
bread
like
back
a
nice
caramel
sugar
sweet
finish
brought
it
all
together
no
taste
of
alcohol
at
all
and
overall
it
was
a
very
easy
drinker
i
could
have
easily
had
another
the
carbonation
stayed
very
nice
throughout
the
session
no
doubt
this
is
a
tasty
beer
its
shy
of
the
greats
but
certainly
one
to
try
t
syrupy
sweet
with
caramel
brown
sugar
malt
and
rye
bread
theres
a
little
warmness
as
the
beer
goes
down
that
leaves
a
nice
sensation
but
overall
not
a
fantastic
doppelbock
a
little
too
syrupy
for
me
great
product
from
my
home
town
of
cincinnati
all
told
emancipator
isnt
bad
i
actually
find
it
fairly
enjoyable
it
just
seems
rough
around
the
edges
i
dont
know
the
abv
but
there
isnt
any
alcohol
heat

nothing

75th
anniversary
of
the
repeal

although
its
from

thats
something
we
can
all
raise

i
liked
this
a
lot
was
very
sweet
and
refreshing
would
be
nice
on
a
fall
night
during
an
outside
activity
this
is
a
good
double
bock
but
since
ive
had
it
i
would
try
a
different
brewers
to
compare
the
flavor
brings

with
some

dough
and
cracker
maltiness
a
healthy
dose
of

comments
a
beer
of
the
month
selection
overall
a
good
example
of
a
doppelbock
it
has
renewed
my
interest
in
the
style
d
emancipator
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
dominated
by
sweet
malts
but
never
cloying
balanced
just
enough
by
some
of
the
dark
fruit
notes
and
subtle
herbal
hops
at
the
risk
of
sounding
too
cliché
i
wish
i
had
some
wienerschnitzel
with
spaetzle
to
go
along
with
the
beer
a
biergarten
would
be
nice
too
overall
admittedly
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
and
wouldnt
have
bought
this
if
it
hadnt
come
in
a
beer
of
the
month
pack
i
could
see
it
being
nice
sitting
by
a
wood
fire
or
in
the
winter
but
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
for
me
pours
a
clear
brown
with
minimal
head
the
smell
is
pretty
indistict
some
sweetness
and
a
little
wheat
mmmm
tastes
much
better
big
sweet
caramel
and
some
banana
charged
with
bubbles
this
one
is
going
down
real
easy
and
i
could
easily
down
another
body
was
on
the
light
side
with
little
carbonation
finishes
sweet
and
the
flavors
come
out
a
little
more
as
it
warms
up
to
room
temperature
this
goes
down
pretty
easily
due
to
the
sweetness
in
the
finish
looking
forward
to
another
a
good
looking
selection
from
a
recent
botmc
delivery

give
it
a

the
carbonation
it
really
varies
from
the
style
not
the
roasted
malts
but
the
slight
bitterness
but
i
like
this
twist
of
roasted
malts
and
a
little
hop
bite
i
am
rating
this
one
on
pure
flavor
and
not
style
conformance
this
beer
should
be
imbibed
closer
to
room
temperature
to
get
the
full
flavor
range
poured
to
a
pure
amber
i
wouldnt
really
describe
mine
as
light
or
dark
just
pure
the
head
fizzed
away
in
about
5
seconds
didnt
put
a
stopwatch
to
it
but
maybe
im
guilty
with
not
a
vigorous
enough
pour
the
jurys
out
im
smelling
sweet
dark
fruits
catching
a
roasty
vibe
in
there
also
sweet
sweet
malty
flavor
i
can
taste
some
alcohol
but
it
seems
hidden
quite
well
caramel
with
that
sip
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
full
bodied
i
agree
with
the
botm
description
as
chewy
i
would
most
def
purhcase
this
beer
again
probably
not
one
of
the
more
sought
after
dbocks
but
i
found
my
3
brews
very
enjoyable
imo
ayinger
celebrator
dopplebock
sets
the
standard
but
this
was
a
very
good
us
version
that
did
the
job
well
and
is
quite
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
i
recommend
trying
this
beer
d
a
little
too
much
chocolateroastiness
and
too
little
body
to
warrant
drinking
many
of
these
maybe
doppelbocks
arent
my
cup
of
tea
but
ill
still
rate
to
style
i
got
this
as
part
of
a
botmc
i
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
perfect
pint
glass
it
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
2
finger
white
head
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
molases
dark
fruit
figs
the
flavor
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
but
has
the
same
notes
it
finishes
with
a
lingering
sweetness
imo
it
is
thin
for
the
style
a
solid
beer
yes
there
are
better
doppelbocks
but
this
is
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
watery
side
all
in
all
makes
for
an
average
drink
dthis
is
a
nice
unassuming
drinker
with
some
redeeming
qualities
doesnt
compare
to
the
top
doppels
my
suggestion
would
be
to
label
this
just
a
bock
its
a
decent
beer
but
just
not
really
a
doppel
in
my
eyes
edit
a
little
further
in
the
caramel
sweetness
becomes
a
little
more
forward
but
still
not
great
bumped
the
flavor
from
a
2
to
a
2
5
thats
all
d
somewhat
strong
for
a
session
beer
but
lot
of
flavor
and
characteristics
would
make
a
great
replacement
for
a
red
wine
in
pairing
it
with
a
main
course
d
although
not
a
great
beer
this
is
a
pretty
good
american
example
could
certainly
drink
a
couple
of
these
jonathan
passow
if
i
do
find
it
fresh
i
will
pick
up
a
bottle
just
to
give
it
a
try
fresh
vs
aged
we
have
to
hope
that
aging
was
the
bad
choice
here
md
very
clean
with
low
volumes
of
carbonation
so
flavors
stick
out
very
nicely
its
a
very
easy
sipper
and
should
be
served
around
50
degrees
so
the
aroma
and
taste
opens
up
not
much
trace
of
ethyl
alcohol
taste
but
only
the
warming
sensation
towards
the
end
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
because
its
only
down
side
is
the
aftertaste
everything
else
is
quite
nice
and
i
can
easily
get
past
that
i
know
a
little
trick
keep
drinking
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
pours
an
amberruby
red
color
with
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
it
smells
like
toasted
malt
caramel
and
some
bready
malt
aroma
is
nice
but
seems
a
bit
weak
to
me
luckily
the
flavor
is
stronger
than
the
aroma
is
it
tastes
like
bready
malt
and
caramel
along
with
some
toffee
and
prunesfigs
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
has
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
it
could
be
better
overall
i
think
its
a
decent
enough
brew
however
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
dopplebock
this
wouldnt
be
close
to
being
my
first
choice
with
that
being
said
its
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
d
a
so
so
beer
not
impressed
in
general
with
this
brewery
or
this
beer
decent
but
not
really
memorable
overall
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
is
smooth
and
a
little
flat
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
light
okay
this
beer
lacks
some
serious
flavors
it
is
bland
and
uninteresting
d
this
is
a
great
beer
as
far
as
bocks
go
ill
be
revisiting
this
one
drinkability
high
this
is
really
a
solid
beer
that
doesnt
overwhelm
just
does
the
trick
a
very
manageable
abv
and
a
very
refereshing
beer
to
enjoy
after
a
very
long
day
of
work
while
watching
a
reds
game
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
more
of
this
d
i
got
two
of
these
from
my
neighbor
after
sharing
some
kentucky
breakfast
stout
with
him
im
glad
i
have
another
since
i
look
forward
to
having
this
one
again
i
would
say
its
highly
drinkable
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
a
great
addition
to
a
winterfall
lineup
drinks
easy
for
the
style
abv
not
as
much
guts
as
i
hoped
but
still
a
darn
good
effort
from
a
brewery
i
havent
had
in
a
while
would
buy
again
tell
my
self
im
drinking
a
bock
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
but
smooth
going
down
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
drinking
a
six
pack
of
this
but
i
probably
wouldnt
go
out
and
buy
one
nikki
bottle
from
party
source
not
sure
if
this
is
similar
to
the
original
christian
moerlein
doppelbock
as
i
never
tried
that
one
this
beer
pours
a
mostly
clear
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
medium
and
frothy
beige
head
that
diminishes
slowly
patches
of
lacing
on
the
glass
toasted
malt
caramel
and
hops
in
the
nose
mediumbodied
and
smooth
with
sweet
malt
caramel
and
hops
flavors
along
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
the
finish
is
moderately
sweet
with
notes
of
burnt
malt
and
hops
lingering
pretty
enjoyable
from
start
to
finish
drinkability
hell
yes
have
em
all
day
long
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
doppelbocks
if
not
my
favorite
is
there
another
doppelbock
that
can
come
along
and
dethrone
the
emancipator
interesting
and
certainly
a
good
example
of
a
doppelbock
this
is
actually
better
than
i
expected
and
once
it
starts
to
warm
up
a
bit
from
its
initial
serving
temperature
of
50f
10c
the
body
starts
to
get
a
bit
more
rich
and
has
a
fullness
which
helps
carry
the
rich
malt
flavors
this
is
not
bad
but
i
wonder
about
the
freshness
of
the
sample
well
so
far
ive
been
pretty
impressed
with
what
christian
moerlein
is
brewing
and
im
kind
of
surprised
that
there
arent
more
reviews
for
their
beers
people
youre
missing
out
on
some
good
stuff
notes
an
extra
from
moose3285
thanks
mike
very
enjoyable
stuff
d
pretty
good
doppelbock
better
than
i
was
expecting
overall
this
was
a
good
doppelbock
but
i
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
notes
from
08
nhc
almost
medium
body
with
ample
carbonation
alcohol
well
hidden
nice
d
this
is
a
great
dopplebock
not
quite
up
to
celebrator
standards
but
among
the
best
ive
had
i
tend
not
to
be
as
big
a
fan
of
most
lagers
but
this
fits
the
standards
well
and
were
it
not
a
limited
local
to
cincinnati
brew
could
be
a
regular
rotation
for
me
pours
a
translucent
brown
in
color
that
has
ruby
highlights
around
the
edges
a
head
forms
on
the
pour
but
quickly
is
gone
smell
is
all
malt
and
toffee
taste
is
much
the
same
but
im
getting
a
nutty
almond
like
flavor
that
im
liking
good
solid
offering
from
cm
well
done
danke
pimpp
bells
and
victory
have
since
restored
my
faith
in
this
style
a
really
well
balanced
brew
not
too
heavy
and
nowhere
near
being
light
i
will
certainly
have
this
while
its
around
especially
since
its
in
walking
distance
of
the
office
drinkability
very
tasty
i
really
am
impressed
with
what
cm
has
put
out
in
the
past
12
months
this
is
a
finely
crafted
brew
i
need
a
blind
headtohead
against
some
of
the
better
rated
dbs
to
see
how
it
fares
against
its
peers
edit
let
it
be
known
that
ive
not
eaten
at
all
today
ive
been
up
about
14
hours
and
im
on
my
second
glass
of
this
i
am
not
really
all
that
hungry
by
the
time
this
glass
is
done
i
will
prolly
be
full
the
bros
are
right
when
they
say
that
this
style
is
a
meal
in
and
of
itslef
d
very
good
and
im
so
thrilled
that
christian
moerlein
is
putting
out
great
beers
like
this
i
cant
wait
until
they
move
the
brewery
back
to
cincinnati
and
put
a
brewpub
in
the
historic
otr
brewery
district
i
think
this
brew
would
go
great
with
a
strong
tiramisu
final
thought
wow
ive
had
their
doppelbock
before
but
this
emancipator
brand
feels
like
the
highend
model
of
their
original
beer
outstanding
serving
type
bottle
amazing
beer
brings
me
back
to
some
of
those
first
german
beers
i
drank
when
i
started
getting
into
drinking
good
beer
the
smell
color
flavor
are
all
amazing
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
thicker
so
that
is
the
only
slight
detraction
on
this
beer
i
have
another
one
of
their
beers
in
the
collection
i
will
have
to
pull
it
out
soon
o
a
good
beer
above
average
for
sure
not
the
style
im
very
fond
of
but
it
was
worth
the
6
for
the
750ml
for
sure
knowing
what
a
dopplebock
is
in
the
first
place
i
would
likely
have
given
more
points
if
i
follow
what
other
reviewers
gave
if
what
i
described
above
is
reminiscent
of
the
type
then
it
is
an
excellent
example
i
will
likely
try
it
again
after
comparing
other
doppelbock
would
have
again
worth
seeking
out
4

of
ripe

sour

finish
is
long

then
becomes
dry
and
herbal
very
complex
interesting
brew
odelicious
example
of
the
style
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
and
hope
to
find
it
agsin
o
this
doppelbock
is
a
lot
fruitier
and
sweet
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
and
doesnt
have
any
of
the
raisinlike
aromas
or
flavors
that
you
would
normally
expect
a
very
nice
doppelbock
hardly
seems
like
im
drinking
a
lager
at
all
this
is
very
flavorful
dark
and
muddled
an
excellent
breakfast
beer
and
the
best
ive
had
from
les
trios
mousquetaires
well
worth
buying
some
to
try
to
age
o
nice
balance
and
flavor
profile
for
a
boch
the
etoh
is
well
hidden
a
really
solid
dopplebock
overall
oh
man
patience
pays
i
had
no
expectations
whatsoever
for
this
brew
i
just
decided
id
forget
about
it
and
i
might
be
surprised
in
a
couple
years
this
is
beyond
surprise
this
is
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
brew
ive
opened
in
months
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
unlike
most
here
in
the
u
s
that
seem
to
have
good
clarity
thin
head
carbonation
seemed
low
and
perhaps
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
pricey
packaging
with
cork
cage
nose
is
a
delight
with
appetizing
malt
dark
malt
roastyness
and
some
dark
chocolate
palate
is
a
malty
wonderland
delicious
easy
drinking
les
trois
mousquetaires
doppelbock
is
as
classic
an
example
of
the
style
as
iconic
brands
like
optimator
celebrator
salvator
or
korbinian
indeed
while
the
germans
are
responsible
for
the
styles
gold
standards
this
quebecois
brewery
is
making
a
push
for
their
title
this
beer
is
complex
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
a
cryptologist
its
a
mystery
how
it
gets
so
delicious
overall
an
outstanding
beer
and
a
fine
example
of
a
north
american
interpretation
of
the
rich
bock
style
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
o
a
nice
looking
beer
for
sure
the
aroma
continues
the
draw
and
when
finally
tasting
it
just
seems
all
to
come
together
an
enjoyable
sipping
beer
that
worked
nicely
with
sharp
cheese
and
drycured
sausage
this
is
clearly
not
the
state
the
beer
was
in
when
bottled
but
i
suspect
im
enjoying
it
more
than
i
would
have
in
that
event
the
integration
of
the
ragged
woody
oxidation
with
the
deep
boozy
dark
fruits
works
well
mouthfeel
medium
body
not
terribly
heavy
and
not
all
that
light
either
pretty
creamy
carbonation
is
also
somewhere
in
the
middle
its
not
overwhelming
but
its
certainly
there
overall
toothnumbing
sweetness
is
too
much
for
me
but
flavours
and
body
are
great
this
has
a
real
nice
complex
and
diverse
palate
but
it
is
just
way
too
sweet
and
far
too
watery
for
a
doppelbock
for
my
tastes
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
in
body
with
medium
levels
of
carbonation
that
foams
this
up
substantially
yet
gently
on
the
palate
the
resulting
mouthfeel
is
soft
smooth
and
foamy
as
youd
imagine
a
cloud
of
beer
to
be
in
texture
quite
nice
closes
dry
with
substantial
stickiness
lingering
on
the
lips
and
palate
as
to
be
expected
for
the
style
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
french
canadian
doppelbock
that
sounds
like
im
making
things
up
as
i
go
along
not
true
in
truth
this
is
actually
a
really
good
doppelbock
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
lately
i
thought
the
age
on
this
beer
would
have
not
brought
any
good
qualities
to
this
beer
but
i
was
wrong
about
that
if
you
like
doppelbocks
as
much
as
i
do
this
is
one
you
need
to
try
for
yourself
a
complex
and
delicious
beer
very
malty
very
smooth
overall
so
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
i
have
encountered
comes
from
a
french
brewery
in
quebec
who
would
have
guessed
but
this
one
is
a
keeper
overall
very
nice
not
always
a
big
doppelbock
fan
but
this
is
very
nice
perhaps
the
best
i
have
had
overall
this
is
never
a
chore
to
drink
and
easy
to
polish
off
a
bottle
to
oneself
a
real
brewers
work
of
art
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
very
dark
brown
near
black
with
red
tones
massive
light
brown
fine
head
with
massive
lacing
rich
caramel
and
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
aroma
sweet
caramel
malts
dark
and
dried
fruit
hints
of
cherries
some
distinct
sherry
elements
to
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
slight
creaminess
somewhat
on
the
sweet
side
but
complex
enough
to
be
a
delicious
full
flavored
dark
bock
really
enjoyed
this
tasty
and
enjoyable
but
very
assertive
each
sip
simultaneously
leaves
one
wanting
more
and
assaults
the
palate
one
was
enough
to
satisfy
me
i
initially
had
my
doubts
but
this
one
is
so
subtle
nuanced
and
delicious
give
it
time
to
warm
and
youll
be
greatly
rewarded
big
thanks
to
daftcaskbc
for
landing
this
one
bottle
poured
a
deep
brown
color
bock
with
a
nice
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
semisweet
malt
with
some
notes
of
banana
and
cloves
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
cloves
and
banana
ester
with
an
excellent
grain
bill
full
body
with
a
creamy
texture
and
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
probably
one
of
the
best
that
i
have
tasted
form
this
brewery
this
is
a
dessert
in
itself
no
question
the
skill
of
the
brewmaster
however
is
highlighted
by
the
fact
that
this
is
not
overdone
in
sweetness
impact
or
feel
this
edges
out
ayingers
dopplebock
for
me
absolutely
perfect
by
the
fire
in
this
early
stage
of
winter

and
drinkability
based
on
what
it
is
but
i
like
it
not
as
much
as
most
regardless
of
vintage
chocolate
malty
aroma
a
bit
above
average
mouthfeel
chocolate
nutty
caramel
raisin
earthy
sweetish
and
perhaps
too
much
od
a
very
excellent
beer
besides
a
bit
too
gentle
a
nose
and
a
bit
too
strong
an
initial
presentation
to
the
palate
this
beer
goes
down
easy
and
with
pleasure
o
the
best
doppelbock
i
have
had
aside
from
celebrator
definitely
worth
seeking
out
the
interesting
thing
about
it
is
that
while
cold
it
tastes
primarily
of
belgian
dark
fruit
yeast
like
belgian
strong
dark
ales
like
gouden
carolus
classic
and
as
it
warms
it
tastes
more
like
a
malty
doppelbock
d
an
interesting
take
on
the
doppelbock
style
personally
not
sure
i
can
drink
much
1
bottle
of
this
style
a
bit
too
caramelsweet
for
myself
but
something
i
occasionally
enjoy
in
the
colder
months
ps
if
you
have
fruit
flies
in
your
house
they
will
find
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
some
burgundy
highlights
and
some
darker
reds
around
the
edges
when
held
to
the
light
big
fluffy
tan
head
initially
but
fades
to
almost
nothing
and
leaves
behind
an
extremely
thin
collar
nose
has
some
dried
fruits
sweet
malt
characteristics
and
some
earthy
and
woody
notes
almost
akin
to
a
softer
version
of
what
i
remember
picking
up
in
their
altbier
taste
continues
these
sweet
woody
and
earthy
notes
with
some
candied
flavours
in
there
as
well
big
sweet
and
malty
fairly
appropriate
and
standard
from
what
ive
seen
in
the
style
some
spicy
wood
comes
through
in
the
finish
with
touches
of
caramel
and
alcohol
full
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
a
unique
take
on
the
style
i
think
and
something
id
easily
recommend
a
great
rich
complex
lager
with
a
delicious
malt
and
fruit
character
nice
an
enjoyable
brew
flavorful
diverse
and
well
worth
the
extra
time
in
the
cellar
hopefully
i
can
score
another
couple
bottles
of
this
years
edition
to
compare
overall
this
is
a
great
great
example
of
the
style
and
maybe
the
best
doppelbock
i
have
ever
had
would
definitely
revisit
if
it
wasnt
so
rare
and
hard
to
come
by
silly
canadians
definitely
recommended
because
its
quality
is
world
class
the
flavor
matches
the
smell
very
very
sweet
like
an
apertif
i
also
note
a
metallic
tinge
to
the
tongue
very
rich
as
one
might
expect
o
my
first
doppelbock
and
i
must
admit
i
really
enjoyed
it
as
for
drinkability
it
hides
its
high
abv
nicely
my
first
beer
review
for
beeradvocate
definitely
wont
be
the
last
a
very
nice
pour
and
proper
look
of
dark
mahagony
with
some
cloudiness
to
it
nose
is
toasty
malt
and
honey
subtitles
there
are
some
floral
notes
in
the
honey
quality
and
the
palate
seems
to
have
a
what
i
thought
was
going
to
be
a
harsh
tingle
but
which
ended
up
being
a
lot
like
royal
jelly
not
smokey
what
so
every
hints
of
plum
preserve
the
beer
was
sweet
but
still
managed
to
not
fall
into
the
world
of
syrup
even
some
nice
maple
hints
the
best
doppelbock
ive
had
in
north
america
totally
its
own
take
a
tad
bigger
than
expected
but
quite
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
great
almost
syrupy
but
not
quite
benefits
greatly
from
aging
d
hides
the
9
5
well
easier
to
drink
than
you
would
think
a
fantastic
beer
opinion
i
am
really
happy
with
this
beer
and
am
glad
that
i
drug
it
all
the
way
back
from
florida
on
my
motorcycle
i
would
like
it
to
be
a
bit
more
attenuated
so
that
it
didnt
try
to
finish
slightly
toward
the
syrupy
side
of
things
otherwise
to
be
honest
it
was
a
bit
hard
for
me
to
think
that
this
beer
was
really
going
to
be
a
doppelbock
when
it
was
coming
out
of
a
caged
bottle
with
the
words
grand
cuvee
on
top
of
the
label
i
thought
for
sure
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
bock
that
uses
a
belgian
yeast
as
a
lot
of
them
are
doing
that
was
not
the
case
here
this
really
is
a
doppelbock
it
is
just
packaged
a
little
weird
for
the
style
but
i
am
sure
that
you
can
get
over
that
like
i
did
it
isnt
weihenstephaner
korbinian
but
it
is
no
chump
either
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
corked
caged
and
au
naturel
dark
and
inviting
for
sure
but
perhaps
the
darkest
of
this
style
weve
come
across
hints
of
figs
taffy
chalky
yeast
brown
bread
and
molasses
cookies
in
the
aroma
big
malty
mess
slams
the
palate
but
a
good
mess
some
chaos
can
be
a
positive
thing
toasted
and
sweet
almost
roasted
with
undertones
of
coffee
and
cocoa
ripe
fruit
and
a
warming
alcohol
are
noticeable
but
on
the
side
modest
hopping
in
a
toasty
sweet
finish
perhaps
more
traditional
than
modern
this
one
is
super
tasty
and
becomes
a
dangerously
quick
sipper
marvelous
drinkability
this
is
a
malty
beer
that
is
hearty
but
is
to
be
sipped
over
a
long
session
flavors
improved
as
it
warmed
poured
a
dark
brown
with
good
carbonation
and
head
the
smell
was
heavy
on
the
dates
and
raisins
almost
had
the
smell
of
a
quad
to
me
the
taste
was
also
heavy
on
the
dates
and
raisens
and
played
off
the
alcholhol
fairly
well
i
agree
with
what
most
people
have
said
drinkable
could
certainly
have
a
few
but
not
best
represenation
of
this
style
d
i
can
definately
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
over
the
course
of
a
night
the
abv
isnt
outrageous
and
i
shared
the
bottle
not
the
greatest
dopplebock
but
its
quite
good
a
delicious
and
savory
dopplebock
but
the
maltysugary
weight
causes
it
to
be
more
of
a
sipper
than
a
drinkable
brew
think
barleywine
overall
decent
doppelbock
but
fairly
average
decent
drinkability
some
decent
flavors
bottle
pours
a
dark
red
brown
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
head
good
lace
on
the
glass
lots
of
dark
fruit
flavors
and
aroma
including
raisins
plum
and
fig
all
backed
by
a
pretty
hefty
malty
backbone
pretty
sweet
not
bad
but
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
and
tough
to
finish
my
whole
glass
medium
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
good
if
you
realise
that
its
a
9
abv
beer
you
taste
the
alcool
but
the
brew
is
wraped
with
so
much
flavors
that
everything
go
down
pretty
smooth
d
an
excellent
beer
and
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
would
make
a
perfect
fall
or
winter
beer
i
will
look
for
this
one
annually
barely
notice
the
8
7
abv
drinkability
this
is
a
fantastic
doppelbock
quite
probably
the
best
nongerman
doppelbock
i
have
had
and
a
beer
that
can
give
many
of
its
german
peers
a
run
for
their
money
a
very
rich
beer
but
also
very
heavy
and
alcoholic
this
one
makes
for
great
sipping
and
savoring
i
would
be
delighted
to
drink
this
one
again
flavor
is
right
on
key
with
the
aroma
great
malty
mouthfeel
medium
body
decent
carbonation
mild
booziness
picking
up
a
bourbon
characteristic
here
not
sure
if
it
has
been
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
though
nice
wood
notes
big
burnt
chocolate
flavors
and
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
wow
i
love
this
beer
was
a
complete
blind
tasting
great
dopplebock
d
flavours
are
enjoyable
and
the
aspect
of
the
beer
fit
the
doppelbock
style
but
the
sensory
overload
of
sweet
flavours
heavy
feel
and
high
alcohol
make
this
an
occasion
drink
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
or
taste
bud
i
personally
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
its
enjoyable
enough
just
not
really
my
cup
of
beer
a
really
lovely
beer
it
might
just
be
a
tad
off
stylistically
but
if
you
take
it
as
an
interpretations
its
extremely
interesting
flavoursome
and
delicious
d
this
is
surprisingly
drinkable
and
i
was
regretting
having
to
share
it
its
incredibly
delicious
and
highly
recommended
to
anyone
looking
for
a
full
flavoured
dopplebock
quite
sweet
so
would
make
for
a
perfect
dessert
beer
but
can
be
easily
enjoyed
on
any
occasion
d
this
is
an
extremely
pleasing
drink
thanks
again
to
liam
for
this
great
brew
wish
i
could
get
this
often
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
with
thick
white
head
very
beautiful
smell
is
quite
malty
of
grain
and
some
raisinplum
too
flavour
has
a
bit
more
of
hop
bitterness
to
it
than
the
smell
led
on
but
with
rich
malts
to
go
with
it
it
is
very
creamy
great
mouthfeel
one
of
the
best
although
i
cant
think
of
any
that
is
better
dopplebocks
ive
had
09
vintage
poured
into
a
chimay
goblet
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
brownred
with
almost
no
head
retention
at
first
the
carbonation
was
too
high
to
really
notice
some
of
the
depth
of
flavors
but
as
the
beer
settled
it
was
on
the
fruit
flavors
are
big
and
brightcherries
fig
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
this
is
by
far
the
best
doppelbock
ive
had
and
i
highly
recommend
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
carbonation
was
definitely
a
distraction
but
the
beer
became
a
lot
more
enjoyable
over
time
when
it
dropped
out
a
bit
drinkability
is
great
as
it
warms
it
really
fills
out
and
comes
to
life
i
also
appreciated
it
a
little
more
as
the
carbonation
started
to
dissipate
to
a
lower
level
id
be
curious
to
try
this
with
a
little
time
in
the
cellar
so
ill
definitely
be
looking
for
more
of
this
good
stuff
excellent
rendition
of
the
style
really
a
rich
satisfying
drink
without
being
too
sweet
a
little
high
on
the
carbonation
but
not
completely
unacceptable
drinkable
even
at
8
7
alcohol
is
well
hidden
drinking
pretty
damn
good
a
pleasant
warming
brew
ive
been
fortunate
to
have
some
of
the
best
doppelbocks
in
the
world
and
this
deserves
to
be
up
there
punching
with
the
big
boys
its
a
great
beer
and
a
year
of
aging
has
taken
it
to
the
next
level
body
is
medium
sized
but
it
is
pretty
big
and
sticky
feeling
alcohol
is
there
as
it
is
warming
certainly
worth
a
try
for
the
style
and
one
that
i
would
think
will
age
quite
nicely
really
outstanding
poured
with
a
huge
tan
thick
foamy
frothy
head
that
slowly
settles
down
and
some
lace
color
is
a
clear
very
dark
cherry
wood
aroma
is
excellent
with
roast
malt
licorice
pipe
tobacco
caramel
rye
flavor
is
like
aroma
plus
even
more
cocoa
nutmeats
i
like
the
sweetness
of
it
pretty
much
as
thats
according
to
style
however
it
is
perhaps
just
a
tad
too
sweet
body
is
superb
and
so
is
carbonation
just
according
to
style
finish
is
like
flavor
and
again
perhaps
a
tad
sweet
but
still
great
proly
not
session
overall
a
nice
regional
example
of
the
style
certainly
worth
partaking

let
me
get
this
straight
german
style
beer
in
a

brewed
in

interesting
pours
a

quite
puffy
dark

then
a

good

alcohol

in
the
background
well

highly
enjoyable
brew
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
poured
into
a
massive
2l
dipple
mug
pours
a
deep
chestnut
brown
with
a
huge
fluffy
tan
head
that
slowly
slowly
dissipates
into
a
rocky
cap
not
sure
if
it
is
the
pure
volumn
of
beer
i
just
poured
but
the
head
retention
is
awesome
the
aroma
is
big
and
boozy
meaty
spot
on
dopplebock
aroma
big
raisin
and
prune
with
a
meaty

quite
meaty

the
taste

there
was
such
a
thing
raisins
and
prunes
carob
and
enough
of
a
roasted
malt
to
keep
the
others
in
check
this
is
a
big
heavy
dopplebock
the
aftertaste
is
good
nice
and
woodsy
with
hints
of
chocolate
the
feel
is
moderate
to
full
but
not
chewy
nice
tingly
carbonation
helps
cut
through
the
malt
abv
is
noticable
you
know
it
is
there
a
french
canadian
german
style
brew
well
they
did
a
great
job
authentic
flavors
big
and
bold
like
a
dopplebock
should
be
along
with
a
nice
roasty
malt
body
taste
is
exceptional
with
chocolate
malts
and
molasses
or
syrup
this
is
a
complex
beer
there
is
also
some
spice
and
hops
with
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
smokiness
this
beer
could
pass
as
a
sweet
stout
that
may
be
the
only
drawback
it
is
a
little
sweet
but
that
makes
it
appealing
as
you
drink
it
the
mouth
feel
contains
some
nice
bite
and
it
is
very
smooth
as
you
drink
it
this
is
a
desert
beer
due
to
its
richness
i
should
have
invited
someone
over
drinking
this
bottle
by
myself
will
be
fun
but
i
will
be
full
it
is
also
quite
strong
abv
for
the
style
but
i
could
not
tell
it
by
the
taste
just
the
after
effect
i
cant
wait
to
try
some
other
beers
from
this
brewery
it
appears
they
really
know
what
they
are
doing
beer
this
nice
is
hard
to
come
by
as
some
have
mentioned
a
very
bold
in
your
face
doppelbock
but
one
id
certainly
recommend
trying
delicious
d
very
nice
subtle
complex
smooth
doppelbock
another
great
beer
from
this
brewer
one
of
the
best
brewers
in
canada
without
doubt
im
very
happy
all
these
great
beers
from
quebec
are
making
it
out
to
alberta
a
cultural
void
may
exist
here
in
alberta
but
at
least
we
have
a
great
selection
of
beer
d
too
easy
d
this
one
is
heavy
you
wont
drink
another
one
after
this
750
ml
the
alcohol
is
present
and
its
a
bold
and
heavy
brew
so
a
third
of
a
bottle
was
about
right
for
me
while
good
i
dont
think
id
want
a
whole
750
ml
of
it
at
one
time
especially
at
9
5
alcohol
9
5
abv
certainly
doesnt
drink
like
it
dangerously
easy
to
sip
away
at
this
is
one
to
check
out
if
you
can
there
are
better
more
rounded
and
focused
doppelbocks
available
and
many
that
mask
the
alcohol
better
but
theres
also
a
bit
of
charm
to
the
all
out
attack
of
this
one
worth
trying
for
fans
of
the
style
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
my
third
beer
from
this
brewery
and
i
keep
on
being
impressed
by
them
as
for
the
beer
itself
its
great
but
may
be
just
a
tad
too
bold
and
rich
for
its
own
good
or
mine
im
completely
looped
man
a
pleasantly
upsized
doppelbock
the
booze
quite
nicely
integrated
making
this
all
seem
like
a
big
ol
slice
of
sozzled
german
chocolate
cake
given
that
the
intensity
here
when
compared
to
this
styles
typical
component
flavours
seems
so
heightened
perhaps
the
grand
cuvee
naming
scheme
should
be
amended
with
an
imperial
designation
along
the
lines
of
some
this

is
a

that
is

worth
picking

750ml
bottle

a
clear
dark

color
with
a
largebubbled
very
slight
and
quicklydisappearing
head
the
aroma
is
sweetish
dark
malts
but
not
the
good
german
toffeelike
goodness
i
love
the
flavor
is
sweet
dark
malts
up
front
then
turning
into
a
lingering
roastiness
carbonation
is
low
and
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
thick
this
brew
tastes
like
a
fairly
sweet
dark
strong
lager
ale
which
has
been
blended
with
a
roasty
porter
or
stout
if
you
want
to
call
this
a
doppelbock
then
its
definitely
a
new
world
idea
of
a
dbock
and
nowhere
close
to
an
authentic
dbock
from
the
old
country
still
i
think
its
a
good
strong
dark
beer
for
what
its
worth
i
found
this
brew
to
be
quite
drinkable
when
pairedcontrasted
with
some
buttermilk
blue
cheese
on
its
own
im
not
sure
if
i
would
have
finished
the
bottle
d
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
i
tend
to
find
myself
being
rather
critical
of
doppelbocks
even
though
i
continue
to
consider
them
a
favourite
style
that
said
this
big
brew
was
done
exceptionally
well
full
of
flavour
and
wonderfully
balanced
im
quite
happy
to
have
tried
it
and
certainly
recommend
that
others
give
it
a
shot
as
well
an
all
round
decent
offering
id
rate
the
drinkability
higher
but
after
a
while
this
doppelbock
does
tend
to
become
cloyingly
sweet
and
the
alcohol
presence
does
start
to
become
somewhat
boozy
making
a
bottle
this
size
a
prime
candidate
to
share
rather
than
allowing
it
to
over
stay
its
welcome
or
rather
its
not
unwelcome
but
does
become
a
bit
overwhelming
after
a
while
while
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
i
think
its
too
intense
to
drink
often
i
can
foresee
having
trouble
with
finishing
this
750ml
on
my
own
the
alcohol
is
pretty
strong
this
is
not
the
smoothest
beer
ive
ever
had
but
im
enjoying
this
new
style
d
easy
to
quaff
however
one
750
ml
bottle
is
enough
for
one
person
to
put
a
smile
on
its
face
the
alcohol
is
treacherous
since
it
hits
you
when
it
is
too
late
overall
impression
tastes
to
me
almost
like
an
imperial
stout
thats
been
lagered
also
reminds
me
in
some
ways
of
an
eisbock
albeit
less
vinuous
and
more
carbonated
and
roasty
this
is
definitely
not
your
standard
doppelbock
its
the
third
beer
ive
tried
from
this
brewery
and
they
are
impressing
me
more
and
more
all
in
all
this
beer
kicks
ass
and
i
want
more
d
its
pretty
warming
500ml
bottle
served
in
pub
glass
beer
pours
orange
amber
in
color
and
somewhat
cloudy
showing
evidence
of
bottle
fermentation
sweet
fruity
aroma
a
little
plum
flavor
is
on
the
sweet
side
too
finishing
with
a
small
dose
of
german
hops
but
not
at
all
dry
fortunately
that
rules
out
any
of
the
chalkiness
sometimes
associated
with
bock
beers
also
the
alcohol
is
not
at
all
present
the
parallels
with
a
english
barleywine
are
somewhat
remarkable
raisin
stone
fruit
molasses
but
this
high
gravity
beer
is
unmistakably
german
easy
to
drink
but
id
prefer
the
former
o
a
wellcrafted
doppelbock
that
hits
the
marks
youd
want
from
the
style
a
good
frameofreference
beer
and
for
fans
of
the
style
no
doubt
a
solid
goto
lager
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
two
finger
tan
head
aroma
is
dark
fruit
and
molasses
taste
is
also
dark
fruit
and
molasses
with
a
slight
rye
bread
character
mouthfeel
is
medium
would
like
a
bit
more
feel
overall
a
very
well
done
dopplebock
one
of
the
go
tos
for
the
style
o
very
impressed
with
this
beer
really
balanced
nice
caramel
sweetness
up
front
with
some
bitterness
and
dark
fruits
mixed
in
really
good
the
aroma
is
not
as
good
as
the
taste
this
is
my
second
dopple
bock
the
first
was
ayinger
and
this
is
just
as
good
had
this
over
at
my
bros
earlier
this
week
the
base
sweetness
paired
quite
well
with
the
germanstyle
dinner
of
glazed
ham
and
german
potato
salad

great
tasting
double
bock
will
surely
drink
more
of
this
overall
decent
but
not
spectacular
dopplebock
very
solid
doppel
bock
from
paulaner
exactly
what
i
would
have
expected
i
just
tried
this
for
the
first
time
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
reminded
me
of
a
belgian
very
smooth
and
sweet
but
the
maltiness
does
eventually
feel
heavy
on
you
if
i
am
gonna
have
just
one
beer
this
is
a
good
one
very
satisfying
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
totally
okay
but
not
great
i
seem
to
taste
a
lot
of
chocolate
or
something
similar
in
this
great
beer
smooth
great
character
o
an
elemental
brew
doughy
and
sweet
delicious
an
ok
german
almost
belgian
in
style
very
strong
body
nice
malt
aromas
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
it
turned
me
on
to
dopple
bock
when
the
income
tax
refund
comes
in
gonna
get
me
some
its
not
so
expensive
im
just
el
pooro
extra
smooth
deeply
flavored
doppel
bock
with
a
balanced
sweet
maltiness
toffee
flavor
to
demonstrate
my
lack
of
lager
experience
i
will
say
this
compares
to
a
belgian
dubbel
in
its
maltiness
and
sweetness
obviously
distinct
yeast
profiles
more
to
dark
sugars
than
dried
fruits
the
perfect
german
beer
good
stuff
side
note
poured
on
draft
at
the
new
fassler
hall
in
oklahoma
city
ok
its
an
good
beer
but
would
pass
for
other
dopple
bocks
the
taste
is
hidden
by
the
bitterness
nice
little
gem
that
surprised
me
i
am
a
fan
of
malt
and
this
one
hit
me
very
well
a
lot
of
malt
but
it
really
comes
across
as
light
and
drinkable
i
was
really
surprised
that
is
was
7
9
abv
it
did
not
come
across
as
that
high
full
of
flavor
but
very
smooth
and
drinkable
excellent
beer
that
i
hope
to
keep
in
my
regular
rotation
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
tasty
but
a
touch
sweet
if
that
were
toned
down
just
a
bit
it
would
go
from
very
good
to
great
still
worth
a
try
this
is
a
great
bier
overall
great
head
with
minimal
lacing
nice
dark
amber
color
and
not
bitter
by
any
means
smacks
a
bit
of
like
an
oak
flavor
if
that
makes
any
sense
to
you
full
bodied
great
flavor
and
nice
going
down
with
a
alcohol
content
of
7
9
by
volume
it
only
takes
like
three
to
make
an
excellent
nightcap
to
the
end
of
a
long
day
ive
been
living
in
germany
for
about
a
month
now
and
have
lots
of
biers
that
ive
yet
to
sample
but
that
said
this
has
become
my
most
favorite
regular
brew
for
now
great
doppelbock
overall
this
is
a
great
doppelbock
i
had
a
weihestephan
korbinian
last
night
which
likely
taints
my
palate
and
this
does
not
quite
stand
up
to
that
or
the
ayinger
examples
nonetheless
this
is
a
very
solid
and
excellent
beer
but
not
quite
up
to
its
fellow
munich
counterparts
warm
and
malty
great
copper
color
smooth
biscuit
and
bread
decent
but
not
my
favorite
good
beer
a
tad
low
on
the
flavor
chart
but
overall
a
well
brewed
beer
extremely
smooth
beer
to
drink
very
light
mouthfeel
for
being
a
bock
beer
i
felt
like
there
were
strong
caramel
notes
and
it
finished
with
very
little
alcohol
taste
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
tried
which
is
scary
because
its
7
9
bread
malt
and
caramel
dominate
a
silky
smooth
texture
adds
character
a
solid
dopplebock
for
sure
pours
a
hazy
pastel
orange
with
subtle
honey
hues
in
it
a
fat
head
of
tan
foam
that
is
slow
to
fall
nose
is
malty
brown
crusty
bread
rich
dry
malt
that
is
expansive
on
the
nose
as
the
beer
warms
a
hint
of
chocolate
comes
forward
light
caramel
sweetness
underneath
there
is
a
dark
fruit
presence
some
prune
raisin
and
a
faint
whiff
of
alcohol
taste
is
malty
and
rich
breaddy
malt
dry
and
crisp
the
middle
of
the
drink
is
fruity
the
edges
have
some
grassy
hops
in
them
and
the
finish
has
a
touch
of
medicinal
alcohol
the
alcohol
dries
out
the
palate
and
the
malt
lingers
with
a
light
bit
of
that
caramel
sweetness
a
bit
of
bitterness
comes
from
grass
and
form
alcohol
to
finish
this
one
dry
lighter
mouthfeel
than
some
dopplebocks
but
medium
and
full
enough
slight
warming
from
alcohol
sao
paulo
food
match
whatever
grandma
has
cooked
for
you
when
you
visit
her
next
get
a
taste
of
grandmas
world
for
a
change
overall
great
beer
and
while
heavy
on
the
malt
it
works
perfectly
incredibly
drinkable
especially
at
8
which
could
make
this
a
little
dangerous
definitely
worth
a
try
and
i
know
ill
be
getting
this
again
90100
o
not
particularly
a
fan
the
alcohol
should
be
a
bit
better
hidden
for
a
8
something
abv
glass
german
stein
o
very
enjoyable
and
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
nice
complexity
of
flavor
and
just
enough
sweetness
without
there
being
too
much
sweetness
and
it
getting
cloying
alcohol
is
well
hidden
making
this
one
pretty
easy
to
drink
o
when
i
first
had
this
many
years
ago
i
was
blown
away
but
after
having
many
other
great
doppels
i
may
not
be
able
to
rank
this
right
at
the
top
but
without
a
doubt
it
is
near
the
top
of
this
style
im
never
disappointed
with
salvator
and
ill
keep
coming
back
to
this
outstanding
beer
again
and
again
this
is
good
great
in
the
mix
pack
too
just
need
one
more
o
its
a
pretty
solid
doppelbock
overall
pretty
smooth
and
balanced
doppel
with
complexities
to
explore
always
a
pleasure
to
drink
very
nice
smooth
drink
looks
good
in
a
pils

dark
redbrown
amber
and
an
aroma
of
olive
earth
dark
fruit

and
well

a
solid
doppel

at
a
very
good
price
cheers
o
solid
doppelbock
it
may
not
be
the
best
option
but
is
a
good
choice
if
its
available
and
looking
for
something
sweeter
an
easy
drinking
ok
doppelbock
in
which
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
o
great
doppelbock
in
the
same
league
as
the
popular
german
ones
korbinian
celebrator
thank
you
serving
type
bottle
o
like
i
said
in
the
taste
section
i
dont
like
the
big
sweetness
on
the
finish
but
let
it
warm
up
a
little
and
it
mellows
besides
that
its
big
and
full
and
has
a
lot
to
offer
i
love
this
beer
its
so
clean
o
i
find
this
doppelbock
a
bit
too
thin
for
my
taste
its
somewhat
one
dimensional
characters
leave
a
bit
to
be
desired
the
bitterness
is
about
right
but
it
lacks
the
malty
hit
i
like
to
see
in
a
doppelbock
overall
i
would
choose
this
over
any
mass
market
product
and
it
does
fit
the
style
just
not
as
exciting
as
i
would
have
liked
may
be
one
of
the
few
doppelbocks
ive
ever
tried
that
i
would
almost
consider
a
session

to
sip
on
for
the
abv
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
o
my
favorite
bottom
fermented
beer
its
a
malt
bomb
and
for
a
long
time
it
was
my
favorite
beer
if
you
like
malty
beers
this
is
the
beer
for
you
o
a
classic
doppelbock
not
as
complex
as
augustiner
maximator
but
certainly
a
must
for
any
german
beer
novice
historically
its
the
first
goat
beer
in
bavaria
and
it
certainly
holds
that
distinction
nobly
today
o
very
nice
under
assuming
dobblebock
enjoyable
could
easily
toss
3
of
these
back
without
thinking
too
much
about
it
smooth
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
bland
enough
that
most
could
handle
it
bready
sweetness
to
give
the
beer
geek
a
bit
of
fun
too
o
strong
dark
cherry
scent
and
flavor
great
warming
accumulation
that
lingers
longer
than
i
like
a
little
lighter
than
body
than
i
like
but
overall
pretty
good
ruby
with
a
massive
head
lots
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
sweet
biscuity
nutty
aromas
thick
on
the
tongue
and
very
sweet
bananas
with
hints
of
spice
and
some
toffee
some
alcohol
on
the
finish
thick
and
chewy
with
lots
of
nutty
bready
sweetness
o
malt
lovers
rejoice
this
is
exceptional
paulaners
salvator
is
one
of
the
kings
of
the
doppelbock
kingdom
and
for
good
reason
perfect
malt
balance
so
as
to
not
be
overly
sweet
but
still
keep
a
fuller
bodied
feel
that
washes
down
with
delicious
bready
complexity
and
a
smooth
finish
overall
a
good
beer
not
my
favourite
style
though
prost
250ml
tulip
glass
schmankerl
stube
hagerstown
md
overall
pretty
awesome
take
on
the
style
from
this
classic
brewery
definitely
having
more
of
these
in
the
future
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
one
that
i
would
seek
out
again
and
again
o
a
quality
brew
this
beer
is
perfect
for
the
style
as
it
has
the
strong
malt
backbone
coupled
with
a
low
bitterness
level
the
drinkability
may
also
be
a
result
of
the
bock
style
doubled
o
a
wonderful
doppelbock
and
a
perfect
early
autumn
brew
which
would
hold
its
own
or
outdo
just
about
any
octoberfest
beer
ive
had
and
just
the
sort
of
malty
change
of
pace
i
was
looking
for
after
the
sourfruity
grassroots
arctic
saison
i
drank
earlier
overall
ah
a
nice
example
of
the
beer
not
too
strong
and
alcoholic
a
deffinate
find
and
try
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
probably
best
enjoyed
on
a
winters
night
o
a
solid
doppelbock
but
it
lacks
the
defined
complexity
to
be
a
great
one
would
drink
again
though
o
this
is
a
decent
beer
some
characteristics
were
a
little
off
a
little
too
much
roast
a
little
too
syrupy
overall
this
is
a
beer
worth
trying
doppel
bocks
can
be
hard
to
find
around
here
however
a
local
brewery
bayern
in
missoula
produces
some
bock
beers
which
are
better
than
this
one
o
very
nice
indeed
however
its
quite
sweet
and
mollycoddling
and
not
something
id
have
again
without
food
cheers
overall
there
is
a
reason
that
people
think
salvator
when
they
think
doppelbock
this
beer
lives
up
to
its
reputation
as
a
quality
delicious
beer
o
i
actually
really
liked
this
beer
then
again
i
am
easy
when
it
comes
to
malty
beers
id
definitely
buy
this
again
overall
i
was
really
excited
to
find
this
at
my
local
store
but
it
is
a
very
very
poor
example
of
a
dopplebock
i
certainly
will
not
be
buying
it
again
pours
a
lighter
amber
color
and
not
darker
as
i
see
other
double
bocks
have
has
a
thick
head
that
dissipates
quickly
with
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
a
carameltoffee
with
some
malt
not
heavy
on
the
carbonation
which
is
good
the
taste
wasnt
bad
but
the
higher
alcohol
content
made
it
taste
stronger
than
maybe
it
should
be
overall
it
was
a
little
better
than
average
but
not
as
good
as
others
in
the
same
category
o
a
malt
driven
beer
with
some
dark
stone
fruit
character
on
the
paler
end
of
the
double
bock
style
so
a
touch
of
hops
aroma
and
flavor
are
in
there
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
although
this
bottle
it
a
little
old
it
is
still
a
wonderful
beer
the
taste
is
sweet
and
very
malty
like
munich
malt
which
offers
a
big
mouthfeel
the
beer
is
very
malt
oriented
and
bitterness
is
almost
absent
this
makes
the
beer
a
bit
unbalanced
and
overly
sweet
i
expected
more
from
this
beer
overall
a
beautiful
beer
but
i
cant
get
over
the
aftertaste
and
alcohol
burn
just
not
very
good
at
all
for
me
for
the
record
i
love
ayingers
doppelbock
o
a
bit
disappointed
as
i
love
doppelbocks
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
nowhere
near
the
flavor
as
other
quality
dbs
ive
had
flavor
itself
is
decent
but
not
nearly
as
complicated
or
intense
a
flavor
also
didnt
taste
the
freshest
so
i
will
try
it
again
not
a
bad
beer
i
just
feel
there
are
better
beers
of
this
style
remarks
although
a
pretty
decent
doppel
i
dont
find
it
as
tasty
as
my
standby
andechser
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
pours
a
clear
dark
reddish
orange
with
a
thin
super
creamy
tan
head
aromas
of
freshly
milled
munich
malt
taste
begins
with
some
green
apple
then
some
sweetbread
then
a
bit
of
aged
wood
finishing
with
a
spicy
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
rich
overall
an
excellent
dopplebock
overall
more
please
im
happy
that
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
celebrator
because
it
is
cheaper
o
this
doppelbock
is
disappointing
i
cant
say
that
its
without
its
own
charm
but
the
booziness
is
overbearing
o
a
very
good
doppel
bock
to
have
quite
a
treat
wont
be
surprise
if
it
happens
to
be
one
of
the
selected
standard
doppel
bocks
this
doppel
bock
was
paired
with
spicy
lentils
and
basmati
rice
for
lunch
to
create
a
sweetbitter
balance
but
it
was
such
a
caramel
treat
that
i
think
it
also
would
have
been
better
had
for
dessert
this
is
an
overall
great
doppel
bock
for
the
cost
and
is
very
satisfying
my
only
negative
with
this
doppel
bock
was
the
too
high
alcohol
content
im
a
lager
type
of
beer
drinker
that
branch
out
from
time
to
time
hey
change
is
good
but
i
never
drink
to
get
drunk
so
would
have
appreciated
a
lower
abv
this
one
definitely
hits
you
hard
without
tasting
like
it
would
so
consider
yourself
warned
unless
of
course
you
like
it
that
way
o
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
good
easy
going
doppelbock
that
anyone
would
find
pleasure
in
drinking
its
a
beer
that
can
be
had
at
any
time
during
the
day
without
feeling
too
heavy
the
flavors
found
a
nice
even
keel
o
good
beer
probably
one
of
the
standards
in
double
bocks
these
days
good
but
a
bit
too
much
booze
on
it
for
8
good
and
drinkable
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
overall
its
not
my
favorite
doppelbock
but
i
like
this
beer
the
aroma
is
nice
and
the
flavors
are
sweet
without
being
cloying
the
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
it
isnt
sticky
or
syrupy
like
many
other
beers
of
the
style
an
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
beer
o
i
would
really
like
to
grab
a
fresh
one
of
these
in
munchen
i
bet
its
knockyouover
good
what
i
got
here
aint
bad
at
all
a
little
mediciny
but
not
overly
so
i
love
malty
lagers
and
this
is
a
great
malty
lager
with
loads
of
taste
and
character
the
abv
isnt
kidding
7
9
or
plenty
to
get
you
going
o
very
drinkable
doppelbock
probably
a
little
underrated
a
little
bit
of
the
taste
comes
through
in
the
nose
as
the
beer
warms
i
like
it
but
it
could
be
so
much
more
and
really
should
be
always
liked
this
one
though
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
and
i
certainly
recommend
it
even
if
you
also
are
not
a
fan
of
this
style
it
really
lacks
carbonation
and
a
round
mouthfeel
its
a
too
thin
for
me
quite
disappointing
if
i
were
judging
this
beer
by
its
accuracy
to
style
i
would
give
it
a
low
rating
it
lacks
the
many
of
the
attributes
that
a
doppelbock
should
have
and
possesses
some
that
it
shouldnt
however
it
is
still
a
very
tasty
brew
that
ive
bought
many
many
times
and
will
again
overall
this
brew
disappointed
a
bit
with
the
taste
which
is
a
shame
because
the
smell
was
good
this
is
still
a
drinkable
brew
and
it
does
down
nicely
at
the
end
of
the
day
a
pretty
good
doppelbock
i
think
i
am
starting
to
open
up
to
the
style
a
bit
more
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
its
affordable
and
a
good
example
of
a
doppel
bock
but
i
am
not
down
with
the
corn
taste
i
will
however
score
this
beer
fairly
high
because
it
seems
to
meet
most
of
the
requirements
of
a
doppel
bock
and
is
for
the
most
part
pleasant
im
going
to
say
an
average
of
4
may
be
in
order
bottom
line
average
bock
solid
doppelbock
even
better
it
gets
a
bit
cold
this
is
a
good
example
to
differentiate
between
a
doppelbock
and
a
lame
malt
licquor
very
rich
deep
barley
malts
brown
bread
caramel
toasted
spiced
rum
touch
of
molasses
bitterness
is
very
mild
soft
semi
dry
finish
body
is
full
a
little
syrupy
warmth
smooth
easy
drinking
overall
alcohol
is
hidden
well
and
the
caramel
comes
out
well
a
pretty
good
brew
alcoholic
feel
is
definitely
there
this
beer
commands
immediate
respect
by
asserting
a
brawny
ego
and
aggressively
pushing
the
senses
it
makes
me
wish
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
so
it
wouldnt
think
i
was
lame
but
in
this
case
the
heavy
sweetness
is
a
little
overwhelming
i
definitely
recommend
trying
this
beer
d
a
solid
doppelbock
plenty
of
flavor
for
a
lower
abv
doppel
brew
for
the
availability
definitely
worth
picking
up
as
the
beer
gets
warm
the
alcohol
aroma
and
taste
gets
stronger
and
a
bit
unpleasant
i
prefer
drinking
this
one
cold
why
not
i
am
disappointed
with
this
german
product
o
a
good
beer
for
a
few
sips
but
halfway
down
the
booze
starts
to
kill
off
other
flavors
in
my
mouth
worth
trying
however
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
if
anybody
tells
you
otherwise
they
have
probably
had
some
amazing
hookers
o
i
honestly
cant
decide
if
i
like
this
beer
or
absolutely
love
it
at
the
moment
i
expected
something
a
little
easier
to
drink
as
thats
what
im
in
the
mood
for
give
me
a
chilly
night
after
dinner
and
this
would
be
the
perfect
sipper
a
truly
great
beer
o
its
a
good
beer
itd
buy
it
again
in
a
mixyourown
6
pack
but
i
dont
think
i
could
commit
to
a
full
6
pack
of
it
ogood
doppelbock
on
the
lighter
side
but
wasnt
bad
would
get
again
im
not
sure
how
this
is
the
original
doppel
perhaps
in
alcohol
but
not
in
body
ayinger
might
have
this
game
locked
up
for
best
doppel
even
weihenstephaners
korbinian
is
miles
better
o
a
good
beer
that
has
great
availability
its
s
solid
competitor
for
a
go
to
dopple
bock
the
aroma
when
cold
was
awesome
cause
i
was
over
whelmed
by
whoppers
and
i
love
whoppers
anyone
who
doesnt
really
doesnt
exist
and
i
would
rather
not
ever
see
them
anyways
this
is
a
definite
have
to
try
cheers
cheers
othis
beer
was
not
a
bad
beer
but
if
youre
a
fan
of
big
malty
rich
doppelbocks
prepare
for
disappointment
nevertheless
it
has
some
unique
qualities
the
dark
fruit
is
interesting
and
almost
belgian
quad
in
style
that
make
it
worth
a
sip
overall
not
that
good
was
expecting
much
better
overall
probably
the
worst
doppelbock
that
ive
ever
had
the
overly
sweet
flavor
with
zero
balance
and
a
watery
mouthfeel
thin
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
copper
body
with
slowly
rising
bubbles
smells
of
sticky
caramel
and
alcohol
taste
is
brighter
and
more
acidic
than
other
doppelbocks
ive
had
more
apricot
than
plum
and
chocolate
mouth
is
low
in
carbonation
with
sweet
acidic
tingling
surprising
this
drinks
so
fn
easy
and
clean
has
close
to
the
ideal
drinking
profile
of
a
doppelbock
if
not
the
exact
color
or
flavor
that
immediately
comes
to
mind
havent
had
another
beer
like
this
overall
this
delicious
brew
goes
well
with
just
about
anything
alone
its
a
wonderful
nutritious
treat
with
food
its
an
amazing
complement
this
is
a
beer
that
one
must
taste
to
truly
behold
the
wonders
of
paulaner
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
paulaner
their
oktoberfest
their
original
and
their
hefe
are
quality
brewsbut
their
salvatorthe
original
doppelbock
brother
its
on
a
whole
other
level
overall
many
doppelbock
brews
tend
to
be
overly
sweet
but
this
one
is
wonderfully
balanced
it
is
good
to
know
the
father
of
the
style
still
brews
them
right
this
dark
lager
is
sweet
malty
with
some
spices
and
little
toffee
as
well
its
smooth
tasting
and
pours
a
creamy
head
oh
by
the
way
a
salvator
will
pack
a
punch
this
is
no
summertimegrillingburgershopping
on
the
riding
lawn
mower
lager
this
beer
is
alcohol
heavy
and
meant
to
warm
you
up
on
a
cold
bavarian
night
and
it
does
the
trick
nicely
the
flavor
of
a
salvator
goes
really
well
with
a
good
steak
or
any
other
food
with
substance
its
a
great
ski
lodge
brew
and
i
heartily
recommend
it
the
original
doppelbock
doesnt
disappoint
though
nor
does
it
thoroughly
blow
me
away
i
dont
think
i
can
fault
the
brewery
for
that
after
all
craft
brewers
have
had
a
great
deal
of
time
and
motivation
to
explore
and
possible
improve
upon
the
original
i
have
enjoyed
this
brew
a
great
deal
and
will
so
again
im
sure
good
stuff
when
i
had
this
beer
for
the
first
time
i
really
couldnt
stand
it
it
seemed
to
me
its
just
to
strong
and
this
alcohol
strength
dominates
the
taste
second
time
it
had
more
to
offer
would
recommend
to
drink
it
slowly
not
to
be
too
cold
and
to
leave
it
a
bit
in
the
glass
so
it
loses
a
bit
of
alcohol
aroma
its
brown
with
nice
head
which
doesnt
stick
around
for
too
long
it
has
interesting
taste
with
touches
of
bitterness
and
toffee
still
a
bit
sourish
ending
and
strong
alcohol
feel
o
nice
doppelbock
good
balance
tastes
a
tad
sweeter
and
artificially
so
than
the
last
doppel
i
consumed
but
its
still
a
worthy
drink
salvator
is
a
standard
to
which
we
can
measure
a
doppel
a
well
made
doppelbock
but
not
quite
as
thrilling
as
others
i
have
had
in
the
past
its
still
a
good
one
for
beginners
to
the
style
and
perfect
to
crack
open
for
those
wanting
stronger
maltier
beer
as
well
as
pumpkintasting
beers
when
actual
pumpkin
beers
arent
in
season
for
the
price
a
good
runofthemill
pick
overall
its
not
bad
nice
malts
lots
of
tasty
toffee
and
caramel
a
bit
syrupy
nice
wheat
and
banana
like
flavors
a
bit
boozier
than
it
seems
like
it
should
be
but
otherwise
a
nicely
done
typical
german
doppelbock
o
a
nice
doppelbock
and
very
exciting
to
sample
the
original
some
are
better
and
many
are
worse
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
clear
dark
golden
with
a
quickly
dissipating
offwhite
head
there
are
plenty
of
visible
tiny
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
there
are
aromas
of
sweet
and
bready
malt
the
taste
follows
the
nose
the
beer
definitely
tastes
like
liquid
bread
with
toffee
there
is
some
back
end
bitterness
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
smooth
this
is
a
good
sipper
this
is
an
excellent
beer
this
is
a
classic
beer
and
a
musthave
for
springtime
drinking
every
beer
drinker
owes
it
to
themselves
to
try
this
one
at
some
point
it
lacks
the
complex
maltiness
of
ayinger
celebrator
but
i
kind
of
like
the
slight
winy
quality
this
one
has
it
gives
it
a
personality
all
its
own
overall
a
good
beer
initial
taste
is
fizzy
floral
that
fades
into
a
tinge
of
malty
alcohol
but
its
a
smooth
finish
slight
bitterness
not
a
hoppy
beer
a
nice
slight
dark
roast
that
im
tasting
on
my
4th
sip
definitely
a
sipping
beer
and
would
probably
pair
good
with
a
grilled
chicken
breast
and
red
potatoes
very
warm
and
alcoholic
with
a
mediumlow
amount
of
carbonation
overall
solid
but
not
my
style
o
pretty
darn
good
doppelbock
its
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
style
of
beer
and
i
find
that
to
be
rather
refreshing
o
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
can
easily
accidentally
drink
too
much
of
its
clear
it
has
the
precision
of
a
monk
brewed
beer
and
that
ineffable
quality
of
a
perfected
brew
o
good
doppel
back
this
beer
has
been
around
for
a
while
so
they
seem
to
have
it
right
overall
very
poor
mixture
of
off
caramel
overripe
fruits
and
some
kind
of
unpleasant
sweet
flavour
that
smells
and
tastes
like
decay
such
an
unpleasant
beer
add
to
that
it
is
au85
a
case
2012
and
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
had
ever
poured
most
of
it
out
avoid
avoid
avoid
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
i
would
say
that
it
tastes
much
lower
than
the
abv
if
i
wasnt
careful
then
i
could
become
very
drunk
on
this
beer
very
quickly
overall
blech
way
too
much
heat
for
a
beer
thats
only
7
9
this
is
the
kind
of
heat
i
expect
for
beers
over
11
and
beers
that
strong
have
other
flavors
working
for
them
if
i
wanted
to
drink
heat
id
order
a
shot
it
is
also
fairly
boozy
even
though
there
are
lots
of
other
tastes
going
on
i
think
i
am
done
trying
to
do
this
one
there
are
better
more
modern
alternatives
not
bad
not
the
best
i
still
give
that
edge
to
celebrator
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
a
solid
representation
of
the
doppelbock
style
although
this
is
certainly
not
one
of
my
preferred
styles
i
can
still
write
a
pretty
objective
review
nothing
about
this
beer
really
stood
out
had
i
not
taken
notes
when
i
drank
it
i
wouldnt
remember
a
thing
about
it
underwhelming
although
i
would
drink
it
again
and
would
recommend
trying
it
i
can
spend
my
money
on
much
better
things

this
definitely
wont
disappoint
salud
nice
solid
doppelbock
but
after
trying
it
again
i
dont
see
any
reason
to
buy
this
when
i
have
access
to
celebrator
and
korbinian
poured
a
medium
tanned
thin
head
which
it
made
a
reasonable
attempt
to
retain
dark
amber
colour
with
a
slight
haze
smelled
very
boozy
all
other
aromas
were
blocked
out
tasted
dark
chocolate
hints
of
plumb
and
caramel
had
a
very
long
boozy
finish
thick
texture
almost
chewy
some
gas
overall
very
boozy
a
bit
too
much
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
this
rating
system
does
no
justice
to
because
by
these
qualifications
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
but
when
taken
as
a
whole
its
one
heck
of
a
great
beer
pours
a
less
than
amazing
looking
brownish
red
with
a
small
and
rapidly
fading
off
white
head
smells
like
tons
and
tons
of
german
malts
also
a
very
interesting
ale
yeast
flavor
is
what
i
love
here
tons
of
malt
body
earthy
springtime
flavors
but
no
sweetness
or
any
of
that
syrupy
extract
feeling
so
many
big
bocks
have
thats
why
i
love
this
one
its
heavy
and
full
bodied
but
its
also
very
drinkable
despite
its
sturdy
abv
normal
carbonation
and
a
very
round
finish
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
doppelbock
out
its
strong
and
satisfying
without
being
sweet
and
tummy
turning
deserves
better
scores
i
think
poured
into
my
trusty
old
pint
glass
nice
color
kinda
between
golden
brown
and
reddish
smell
wasnt
the
best
taste
of
chocolate
went
down
really
smooth
overall
not
a
bad
beer
great
for
a
thirty
day
after
mowing
your
yard
kinda
beer
but
got
to
love
this
beer
o
this
was
a
really
good
dopplebock
well
balanced
and
enough
alcohol
to
make
it
interesting
o
very
enjoyable
fruity
and
interesting
doppelbock
o
i
was
hoping
for
better
but
this
wouldnt
be
a
bad
beer
to
drink
were
i
back
in
munich
o
wow
really
impressed
with
this
one
it
might
become
a
regular
in
my
fridge
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
this
style
overall
pretty
good
for
the
style
i
have
always
been
a
fan
of
all
the
bock
stylesbock
maibock
dopplebock
etc
and
this
one
aint
half
bad
with
a
medium
light
weight
for
the
style
quite
drinkable
with
a
nice
dry
finish
a
good
balance
overall
alcohol
shows
itself
a
little
strongly
at
times
but
a
nice
balance
for
the
most
part
feel
is
lighter
than
you
expect
nut
enough
to
feel
in
wprthya
good
solid
take
on
the
style
nice
malty
flavors
notes
such
a
dam
tasty
lager
with
a
remarkable
malt
backbone
nice
and
traditional
cheers
overall
seems
like
a
subdued
doppelbock
but
real
easy
drinking
have
to
admit
overall
pretty
drinkable
and
tastes
good
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
doppelbocks
and
this
is
one
to
add
to
the
list
uber
sweet
almost
sticky
sweet
smell
body
is
solid
amber
with
small
white
head
honestly
it
smells
like
a
super
sweet
munich
dunkel
i
was
hoping
for
more
roast
some
dark
malts
maybe
some
balance
but
nope
dry
grains
it
definitely
feels
grainy
like
glbc
paired
with
dry
sticky
caramel
im
guessing
that
the
theme
of
german
starkbier
is
burnt
caramel
sugars
because
it
dominates
here
like
crazy
opimator
is
much
much
better
this
is
less
cooked
than
i
anticipated
and
the
flavor
profile
is
much
different
than
other
dopplebocks
i
have
encountered
the
malt
profile
is
interesting
but
it
also
lacks
depth
the
fruitiness
adds
an
unexpected
layer
however
overall
a
very
impressive
beer
with
a
really
good
blending
of
malts
fruit
and
sweetness
which
made
this
a
wonderful
tasting
experience
o
so
decadent
and
tasty
id
pick
up
a
bottle
of
celebrator
instead
of
this
but
not
by
much
and
thats
a
compliment
not
bad
but
i
prefer
a
less
bozzy
and
more
bready
lager
i
compared
this
side
by
side
with
bells
renowned
consecrator
at
15
and
salvator
is
definitely
equal
or
better
in
some
ways
of
course
germans
should
get
their
own
beer
styles
right
overall
b
strong
beer
with
smooth
character
and
no
off
notes
a
good
drinking
beer
from
a
pilsner
glass
that
stands
up
to
a
cold
wet
day
i
enjoyed
it
with
cheese
and
crackers
poured
from
11
2
oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
a
hazy
deep
caramel
color
with
an
1
of
beige
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
smells
of
apples
and
caramel
big
bready
aroma
taste
is
pretty
good
i
typically
dont
stray
from
the
mainland
too
much
but
i
saw
this
in
the
mix
six
section
and
thought
what
the
hey
smooth
as
can
be
mild
carbonation
a
good
beer
this
is
a
solid
beer
the
flavor
is
decent
and
enjoyable
if
it
werent
for
the
mustiness
this
would
be
a
great
beer
overall
another
really
good
dopplebock
from
a
trusted
german
brewery
overall
tasty
although
not
too
complex
definitely
enjoyable
o
decent
beer
but
the
taste
didnt
live
up
to
the
previews
i
would
try
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
do
this
as
a
session
beer
o
good
beer
im
on
a
dopplebock
kick
lately
before
i
brew
my
first
sometime
this
spring
so
i
wanted
to
try
the
originator
of
the
style
i
didnt
get
any
of
the
salty
soy
meat
aspects
others
did
so
not
sure
whats
up
with
me
or
those
definately
would
drink
again
nice
aroma
and
flavor
but
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
heat
considering
the
abv
it
would
be
good
paired
with
a
meat
dish
however
this
beer
was
not
for
me
dark
copper
orange
in
color
with
a
reddish
hue
and
excellent
clarity
poured
with
a
short
offwhite
foam
that
quickly
dissipated
sweet
toasted
and
caramel
malt
aromas
along
with
raisins
and
ripe
fruit
full
bodied
with
a
smooth
buttery
feel
and
rich
lazy
carbonation
toasted
and
caramel
malts
up
front
that
quickly
get
overcome
by
sweet
ripe
fruit
and
raisin
flavors
through
the
middle
floral
hop
bitterness
emerges
toward
the
finish
as
the
toasted
malt
once
again
returns
finished
semidry
with
a
light
floral
hop
bitterness
overall
it
was
an
ok
beer
it
wouldnt
be
one
of
my
first
choices
sesame
seed
aroma
soy
sauce
low
carbonation
low
hold
and
low
head
amber
color
it
was
a
pretty
sweet
beer
overall
it
was
a
pretty
sweet
beer
in
my
opinion
it
was
very
malty
slightly
roasty
with
a
caramel
finish
not
bitter
at
all
and
no
hops
aroma
this
was
a
dark
amber
colored
beer
the
aroma
was
that
of
soy
sauce
or
sesame
it
was
a
complicated
sweetness
i
was
not
too
fond
of
it
due
to
the
savory
aroma
there
was
little
carbonation
in
the
beer
and
almost
no
head
on
it
heavy
on
the
malt
no
hops
caramely
medium
mouthfeel
when
drunk
the
words
that
best
capture
this
beer
are
complexly
sweet
the
beer
is
very
maltheavy
which
contributes
to
this
savory
sweetness
that
is
apparent
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
i
immediately
get
sesame
and
caramel
on
the
nose
there
are
virtually
no
hops
in
the
aroma
i
would
almost
compare
that
caramely
richness
of
that
heavy
malt
to
a
dr
pepper
sorry
i
have
really
strange
flavor
analogies
a
very
engaging
beer
in
terms
of
flavoraroma
wise
but
its
rather
weak
body
and
mouthfeel
dont
make
it
exceptional
in
my
books
o
very
good
example
of
the
style
considerably
more
flavor
than
the
aroma
suggests
strong
finish
a
bit
boozy
but
typical
for
nearly
8
abv
doa
overall
tasty
dirtcheap
at
between
2
00
and
2
50
and
readily
available
oh
yeah
and
the
bestby
dates
are
clearly
marked
unusual
for
european
imports
that
being
said
theres
not
a
ton
of
depth
here
just
some
toasty
munich
dark
red
fruit
and
a
hint
of
nuttiness
id
rank
this
a
solid
b
and
perhaps
considering
the
price
point
even
up
to
a
b
id
definitely
pick
this
up
now
and
again
this
one
is
just
right
to
savor
with
a
fine
cigar
after
a
holiday
meal
a
good
example
of
this
style
but
there
are
better
o
decent
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
celebrator
but
then
again
not
many
are
o
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
its
got
the
sweet
malt
flavor
i
expect
from
the
style
and
is
packed
full
of
flavor
meal
in
a
glass
indeed
o
wow
i
can
see
why
this
is
the
true
meal
in
a
bottle
heavy
on
the
malts
and
flavor
this
beer
is
perfect
for
these
cold
december
nights
could
use
a
little
more
of
a
carbonation
to
lighten
things
up
and
maybe
a
more
pronounced
hop
character
but
otherwise
this
brews
a
winner
o
i
really
like
this
beer
perfect
if
you
enjoy
the
tastes
of
roasted
malt
and
caramel
but
dont
want
to
drink
something
overpowering
such
as
a
stout
or
porter
olike
most
of
the
paulaner
beersthis
one
is
also
top
beer
overall
not
my
favorite
dopplebock
but
is
certainly
a
very
high
quality
will
revisit
this
one
in
the
future
d
pretty
good
strong
beer
8
99
for
a
6
pack
in
atlanta
ga
i
thought
this
beer
was
great
a
great
darker
german
beer
with
the
classic
german
soul
that
make
german
beer
my
favorite
even
with
that
feel
to
it
it
manages
to
stand
on
its
on
this
is
a
beer
i
would
keep
in
my
fridge
and
have
available
for
when
i
want
a
solid
german
dark
beer
i
believe
it
trumps
the
spaten
optimator
and
i
had
the
opimator
on
tap
notes
this
seems
like
a
higher
gravity
version
of
a
marzen
malty
sweet
but
with
a
real
warming
from
the
alcohol
in
the
belly
i
like
the
dark
fruit
flavors
in
my
doppels
and
this
has
none
of
that
still
this
is
a
good
beer
and
supposedly
the
original
doppelbock
dvery
easy
drinking
however
i
was
looking
for
a
slightly
more
complex
malt
profile
t
you
get
some
sweet
notes
then
there
is
a
bittersweet
taste
on
the
end
the
alcohol
presence
is
noticeable
warming
this
is
a
great
stripped
down
dobbelbock
that
has
a
very
pure
flavor
with
a
malty
sweetness
and
rich
chocolatey
feel
it
is
sweet
but
not
overly
so
and
there
is
a
slight
disconnect
between
the
sweetness
and
the
phenol
flavors
that
become
more
noticeable
on
the
second
bottle
the
head
is
smooth
and
consistent
and
compliments
the
slow
drinking
character
that
the
beer
offers
this
is
a
safe
bet
when
looking
for
a
solid
bock
to
accompany
a
hearty
meal
on
tap
at
pilsener
haus
in
hoboken
a
classic
traditional
german
doppelbock
i
have
drank
many
times
in
bottled
form
its
a
hazy
dark
orangebrown
colored
brew
with
a
smallish
head
that
falls
pretty
quickly
and
leaves
decent
lacing
rich
aroma
of
alcohol
dark
malt
and
dark
fruit
figs
prunes
plums
sweetness
is
evident
in
the
nose
as
well
as
the
taste
this
sweet
flavor
is
offset
by
a
mild
alcohol
presence
a
bit
of
yeastiness
and
lots
of
fruit
flavor
wonderfully
complex
with
excellent
biscuity
malt
carbonation
is
fairly
low
with
a
very
soft
rounded
mouthfeel
thats
easy
to
drink
and
has
just
the
slightest
amount
of
creamy
stickiness
mediumfull
body
ive
always
enjoyed
this
beer
in
the
bottle
but
the
draft
version
is
noticeably
better
and
more
complex
with
flavor
subtleties
that
are
easier
to
pick
up
a
musttry
for
doppelbock
fans
and
a
good
warming
beer
for
a
cool
evening
big
but
not
over
the
top
very
tasty
the
beer
was
way
up
ahead
on
taste
too
rich
smoky
and
sweet
malt
panning
to
a
bittersweet
end
with
almost
everything
in
between
a
lot
of
caramel
and
toffee
plums
and
figgs
and
yeast
breadiness
made
it
a
mouthful
just
about
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
made
it
buoyant
enough
to
be
engulped
within
no
time
this
beer
was
a
real
screamer
and
by
the
end
of
the
500
mil
i
was
feeling
pretty
happy
the
7
9
hides
well
enough
under
the
guise
of
high
drinkability
to
set
you
in
motion
first
off
i
am
reviewing
this
beer
as
i
had
it
on
tap
i
have
had
it
in
a
bottle
before
but
the
draught
is
amazingly
better
the
beer
pours
a
dark
maroonbrown
color
and
has
the
look
and
feel
of
red
wine
the
beer
has
practically
no
carbonation
which
is
awesome
and
smells
of
a
hint
of
red
wine
bordeaux
possibly
and
goes
down
smooth
with
a
hearty
dinner
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
as
it
is
exponentially
better
on
tap
if
you
see
this
on
tap
try
it
found
a
six
pack
for
about
eight
bucks
which
seemed
reasonable
had
tried
once
at
the
airport
in
seville
and
was
okay
with
it
then
so
i
have
it
another
shot
nice
dark
orange
brownish
cloud
free
pour
into
my
tusker
pilsner
glass
slight
head
which
went
away
quickly
but
laced
mildly
rich
malty
smell
taste
is
not
overly
complex
but
pleasant
malty
breast
flavor
the
high
alcohol
is
somewhat
masked
medium
body
for
a
beer
that
is
supposed
totaled
me
through
lenten
fasting
i
imagine
i
would
be
rather
imbibed
if
i
did
not
eat
and
relied
on
this
for
sustenance
but
overall
a
pleasant
but
non
sessionable
beer
o
enjoyable
beer
nicely
balanced
good
rich
deep
dopplebock
very
drinkable
the
head
failed
but
that
my
ahve
been
me
or
the
glass
at
a
party
no
proper
glassware
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
figgy
with
an
aftertaste
of
sour
fruit
and
hops
its
a
pretty
good
beer
very
fruity
not
what
i
was
expecting
for
the
style
but
delicious
nonetheless
not
as
dark
or
complex
as
other
varieties
but
tasty
and
easy
drinking
nonetheless
cant
say
its
my
favorite
db
but
its
pricequality
ratio
makes
it
a
nice
sixpack
choice
when
in
the
mood
for
one
i
would
make
this
my
goto
beer
were
it
regularly
available
overall
paulaner
continuously
delivers
and
is
a
great
brewery
this
is
one
of
their
beers
that
keeps
you
coming
back
its
almost
as
interesting
as
a
quad
but
somewhat
more
drinkable
in
that
its
abv
is
lower
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
say
you
can
truly
taste
the
freshness
of
the
grain
which
isnt
necessarily
attractive
like
a
fruit
metaphor
but
its
more
accurate
this
is
just
a
solid
beer
buy
it
o
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
price
i
paid
8
dollars
for
a
6
pack
and
it
is
nice
tasting
i
will
def
buy
it
again
overall
after
the
very
nice
sweet
aroma
i
was
expecting
more
of
those
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
notes
in
the
mouth
but
this
was
fairly
mild
and
quickly
gave
way
to
alcohol
there
were
no
solvent
flavors
that
made
it
unpleasant
but
this
held
me
back
from
a
higher
rating
the
lack
of
clarity
is
also
inappropriate
if
bjcp
grading
but
didnt
take
away
from
the
enjoyment
pours
a
thick
two
finger
off
white
head
the
color
of
the
beer
itself
is
amber
no
visible
carbonation
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
of
malt
and
soy
sauce
with
a
hint
of
toffee
and
hops
at
the
finish
a
touch
of
alcohol
is
present
as
well
the
taste
is
malt
dominant
very
little
hops
present
but
still
a
strong
hit
of
soy
sauce
a
very
good
dopplebock
would
gladly
purchase
again
m
has
a
medium
bodyhonestly
id
prefer
something
a
little
thicker
for
a
doppelbock
good
carbonation
sweet
syrupy
feeling
left
after
each
sip
the
beer
pours
a
medium
hazy
brown
color
with
a
large
tan
head
the
aroma
is
toffee
and
biscuit
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
dark
fruit
the
flavor
is
very
malty
i
get
a
lot
of
toffee
and
caramel
malt
with
some
dark
fruit
and
grass
from
the
hops
mixed
in
there
is
a
nice
grape
flavor
as
well
as
some
warming
from
the
alcohol
very
easy
to
drink
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
this
is

a
pleasure
to
drink
and
recommend
try
this
one
well
worth
it
cheers
a
very
drinkable
brew
the
price
just
makes
it
even
better
this
will
become
a
regular
in
my
fridge
now
obviously
a
very
meticulously
researched
quality
crafted
beer
up
there
with
the
very
best
doppelbocks
great
price
great
beer
my
first
try
of
the
doppelbock
style
and
im
totally
satisfied
highly
recommended
this
beer
poured
a
a
nice
reddish
brownruby
color
and
was
clear
an
offwhite
head
was
created
it
quickly
dissipated
many
carbonation
streams
emanated
from
the
bottom
aromas
of
dried
fruit
and
chocolate
were
noted
the
taste
contained
hints
of
cherry
wine
a
malty
aftertaste
ensued
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
balanced
overall
this
beer
was
right
on
the
money
for
me
it
was
highly
drinkable
and
more
quaffable
than
some
other
doppelbocks
ive
had
mouthfeel
is
heavy
chewy
and
full
just
like
a
dopplebock
should
be
drinkablity
is
high
despite
the
7

this
beer
goes
down
like
water
an
excellent
dopple
bock
overflowing
with
characer
i
recently
had
this
right
after
sampling
another
wellknown
beer
of
this
style
and
the
salvator
won
hands
down
pours
a
beautiful
dark
orange
with
high
turbidity
and
good
lacing
the
taste
was
a
malty
rich
and
surprisingly
fruity
flavor
with
a
full
mouthfeel
conveys
just
the
right
amount
of
alcohol
aroma
for
a
good
double
very
enjoyable
to
drink
i
would
drink
this
beer
very
often
if
i
wasnt
so
commited
to
trying
new
things
out
of
the
dopplebocks
ive
sampled
so
far
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
d
pretty
drinkable
hides
the
alcohol
nicely
for
my
900th
review
i
sampled
one
of
my
favorites
from
my
munich
days
i
made
salvators
reacquaintance
at
the
beer
market
in
moscow
my
old
friend
came
out
clear
pale
copper
under
a
one
finger
off
white
head
that
lingered
well
and
left
some
decent
lacing
the
brew
came
out
too
cold
but
that
just
allowed
me
to
feel
the
nose
bloom
as
it
warmed
starting
from
nothing
first
some
grain
came
through
then
the
sweet
caramel
and
finally
some
floral
hops
lovely
the
mouth
was
very
prickly
light
and
surprisingly
clean
i
had
remembered
more
viscosity
the
taste
was
much
like
the
nose
starting
off
as
little
more
than
a
dunkles
with
its
sweet
caramel
but
slowly
blossoming
into
something
stronger
with
more
of
an
espresso
bite
by
the
end
the
brew
was
everything
i
had
remembered
both
sweet
and
bitter
with
a
bit
of
fruit
behind
very
nice
indeed
hello
headache
a
bad
bottle
is
possible
here
but
im
not
looking
forward
to
trying
this
again
d
i
was
unable
to
finish
this
beer
based
on
the
other
reviews
this
must
have
been
a
bad
batch
or
bottle
ill
definitely
be
trying
it
again
in
another
location
overalla
good
example
of
the
style
this
is
pretty
good
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
another
the
combination
of
the
spicy
character
and
the
breadlike
flavor
is
starting
to
feel
a
little
strange
theyre
not
playing
off
each
other
in
a
particularly
appealing
way
for
my
taste
buds
this
dopplebock
has
beautiful
orange
amber
color
the
smell
was
rich
and
malty
with
an
apple
cider
undercurrent
you
start
to
taste
dried
fruit
then
a
big
complex
malty
body
and
an
aftertaste
that
changes
with
each
swallow
it
had
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
and
a
good
drinkability
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
again
good
for
the
style
kinda
like
eating
a
pastry
btw
trader
joes
is
now
stocking
an
expanded
craft
beer
selection
i
didnt
buy
any
because
ive
had
bad
wine
experiences
there
i
will
have
to
investigate
further
at
a
later
time
this
is
a
pretty
nice
doppelbock
id
love
to
try
it
on
draft
uf
poured
a
dark
red
with
a
slight
head
and
little
lacing
smell
is
potent
smells
somewhat
like
a
saison
interestingly
enough
taste
is
bold
evidence
of
herbal
undertones
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
saison
ale
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavy
but
unoffensive
this
beer
has
a
high
abv
that
is
definitely
evident
a
good
winter
brew
to
keep
you
warm
on
those
cold
nights
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
solid
though
shortlived
head
smells
wonderful
caramel
toasted
malts
dark
fruits
and
brown
sugar
mmm
tastes
even
better
very
well
balanced
bready
and
sweet
yet
not
overly
sticky
rounded
out
with
a
certain
crispness
maltlicious
great
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
one
of
the
best
dobble
bocks
out
there
body
is
between
medium
and
large
with
a
very
mushy
creamy
mouthfeel
and
slippery
smooth
texture
would
not
want
more
than
one
bottle
in
a
sitting
due
to
the
sweetness
verdict
this
beer
is
quite
a
confection
its
sweet
but
never
cloying
d
it
just
tastes
so
damned
good
gone
before
i
knew
it
had
this
one
on
tap
and
i
tried
it
it
was
somewhat
dark
but
almost
amberish
but
for
the
most
part
the
appearance
and
smell
seemed
to
indicate
another
great
german
dopplebock
however
i
was
disappointed
i
could
tell
it
was
a
good
quality
beer
and
it
was
decent
in
most
ways
but
for
one
thing
its
flavors
didnt
seem
to
mix
well
one
ingredient
was
especially
prominenti
couldnt
tell
what
it
was
and
it
kind
of
ruined
it
for
me
didnt
taste
as
rich
or
complex
as
some
other
dopplebocks
certainly
not
as
balanced
with
a
noticeable
unpleasant
aftertaste
this
was
the
first
german
beer
i
had
that
i
found
difficult
to
finish
my
friend
tried
a
sip
and
in
disgust
compared
it
to
dogfood
d
this
beer
has
great
depth
in
flavor
but
is
a
very
clean
and
balanced
lager
a
great
beer
and
a
great
doppelbock
not
as
drinkable
as
celebrator
or
optimator
i
was
a
bit
dissappointed
ive
been
waiting
all
day
to
get
home
from
work
to
try
this
but
its
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
dont
get
me
wrong
its
still
a
good
beer
but
i
think
i
prefer
optimator
for
similar
price
or
celebrator
if
i
splurge
pours
a
remarkably
clear
amber
color
with
a
frothy
tan
head
that
retains
alright
the
aroma
is
intensely
malty
with
big
toasted
bread
caramel
and
dark
fruit
fig
plumand
grape
as
well
as
some
noble
hops
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
also
quite
malty
with
big
caramel
and
toasted
bread
flavors
upfront
as
well
as
dark
ripened
fruit
fig
plum
grape
hallertau
hops
and
some
ethanol
the
mouthfeel
is
a
chewy
medium
with
light
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
excellent
for
a
dopplebock
quite
enjoyed
this
dopplebock
more
drinkable
than
most
while
not
as
complex
and
interesting
as
the
celebrator
a
fine
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
drinking
again
soon
id
call
this
a
medium
bodied
well
balanced
double
bock
nothing
overpowering
with
a
nice
hoppy
finish
quite
drinkable
poured
a
lovely
dark
brownorange
color
with
an
offwhite
colored
head
that
dissipated
in
less
than
a
minute
but
left
a
small
1
cm
head
throughout
the
session
aromas
of
roasted
malt
spiced
candy
caramel
and
dates
were
detectable
the
taste
followed
the
aromas
with
an
explosion
of
sweetness
the
texture
was
thick
and
bready
making
it
exceedingly
rich
and
smooth
delicate
flavors
danced
across
my
tongue
and
generated
varying
levels
of
sweetness
coating
my
entire
mouth
easily
excellent
drinkability
since
the
abv
is
well
hidden
and
the
beer
is
so
flavorful
and
smooth
poured
a
warm
clean
copper
color
into
a
pint
glass
thin
head
fell
quickly
to
thin
off
white
lacing
smells
of
malt
and
caramel
with
hints
of
cinnamon
and
spice
tastes
like
toffee
and
caramel
close
to
a
winter
warmer
less
spice
than
that
in
the
aroma
mouthfeel
slick
and
viscous
feels
thicker
than
it
appears
excellent
level
of
carbonation
making
it
very
drinkable
even
with
the
seven
and
a
half
percent
abv
present
might
seek
out
again
once
i
know
more
of
the
style
this
is
my
first
true
doppelbock
dcould
easily
have
a
few
more
although
the
higher
alcohol
content
would
kick
in
i
am
not
very
familiar
with
doppelbocks
but
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
not
close
to
my
favorite
but
tends
to
be
hit
miss
in
colorado
some
bottles
seem
to
hold
up
better
than
others
this
beer
didnt
really
wow
me
much
more
in
germany
than
now
a
great
beer
to
intoduce
someone
to
dopplebocks
though
never
strays
too
far
away
from
very
goodnessgreatness
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
medium
sized
head
that
doesnt
last
long
and
fizzes
away
smells
of
breads
and
a
sweetness
that
reminds
me
of
grapes
this
seems
to
fit
the
typical
dopple
bocks
style
taste
is
smooth
with
a
very
sweet
characteristic
bready
tastes
with
an
almost
sour
undertone
very
nice
blend
of
malts
in
this
ancient
brew
a
great
beer
for
the
style
that
leaves
a
nice
maltiness
in
the
mouth
very
drinkable
chewy
mouthfeel
with
a
full
body
just
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
a
nice
warming
sensation
to
this
beer
it
doesnt
taste
much
like
a
7
plus
very
drinkable
as
usual
freshest
is
bestest
overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
and
could
drink
several
in
a
sitting
without
ever
growing
weary
of
the
taste
poured
into
a
celebrator
glass
this
was
slightly
more
transparent
than
expected
with
rich
orangish
amber
to
red
hues
and
a
solid
whitish
head
that
receded
leaving
a
ring
and
modest
residue
on
top
the
active
carbonation
combined
with
the
glasswear
makes
this
look
like
a
commercial
gorgeous
nose
is
of
course
is
almost
completely
comprised
of
malt
malt
and
more
malt
molasses
and
oats
are
most
apparent
taste
is
completely
spot
on
all
i
could
ask
for
from
the
style
super
sweet
reminds
me
of
drinking
maple
syrup
with
the
sweetness
and
thick
mouthfeel
the
only
real
drawback
is
that
drinkability
is
low
because
of
the
extreme
sweetness
and
filling
nature
quickly
becoming
a
favorite
style
of
mine
this
is
the
best
ive
tried
so
far
i
prefer
this
to
celebrator
until
i
drink
another
celebrator
that
is
drinkability
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
there
was
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
present
ot
help
this
beer
slide
down
this
beer
really
lives
up
to
its
designation
there
is
a
lot
of
malt
in
this
brew
and
you
can
almost
taste
the
molasas
like
consistancy
that
comes
with
it
smell
is
overwhelmingly
of
dark
extract
with
nothing
else
coming
through
even
with
the
ferocity
of
the
extract
this
still
manages
to
go
down
smooth
and
balanced
the
mouthfeel
retains
the
smoothness
and
makes
the
dinkablility
very
high
a
great
beer
those
who
are
into
hoppy
or
even
balanced
brews
most
likely
will
not
like
this
beer
but
if
you
just
want
a
huge
sweet
dessert
beer
perhaps
to
eat
with
creme
brulee
or
cheesecake
this
is
your
doublebock
as
the
temperature
of
the
beer
increases
the
flavors
strengthen
and
the
beer
becomes
even
more
smooth
and
dry
overall
this
double
bock
is
very
nice
beer
cmon
the
bottle
says
theyve
been
doing
it
same
way
for
over
370
years
thats
gotta
count
for
something
d
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
nor
my
favorite
beer
however
for
what
it
is
it
leaves
you
going
back
sip
after
sip
definitely
one
i
can
enjoy
on
occasion
when
in
the
mood
if
you
like
to
chew
on
chocolate
coated
espresso
beans
this
is
a
good
night
cap
for
you
a
wonderful
german
treat
this
is
a
great
double
bock
my
favorite
of
the
style
a
great
beer
to
have
in
the
winter
months
500
ml
bottle
bought
in
bier
spezi
hamburg
reddish
amber
colour
large
orange
to
light
tan
head
surprisingly
alcoholic
aroma
elements
of
molasses
caramel
and
syrup
hints
of
dried
dark
fruits
port
wine
and
oak
flavour
is
also
rather
alcoholic
malty
sweet
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
with
plenty
of
caramel
and
molasses
a
herbal
spiciness
and
moderate
hops
in
the
finish
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
much
darker
weltenburger
kloster
asam
bock
but
still
a
very
powerful
beer
in
any
way
definitely
a
winter
warmer
different
than
most
dopplebocks
ive
had
but
what
does
that
say
when
this
is
a
very
old
recipe
taste
malts
honey
apples
caramel
followed
by
little
hoppy
bitterness
i
cant
really
taste
any
aolcohol
it
goes
down
really
easy
at
first
but
after
a
while
it
almost
becomes
to
sweet
for
me
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
with
just
enough
carbonation
anyway
a
good
doppelbock
but
not
in
my
opinion
in
the
same
league
as
ayinger
celebrator
which
i
still
have
3
more
bottles
of
and
will
review
later
woo
joey
this
beer
is
solid
and
one
that
ive
seen
around
much
more
often
than
some
other
quality
imported
doppelbocks
a
great
brew
and
i
found
it
fitting
on
an
incresingly
cold
autumn
day
ill
pick
it
up
again
a
generous
alcohol
content
beer
hard
and
sweet

smell
little
singed
malted
little
phenolic
watered
down

try
with
german
and
american
food
serve
in
a

this
is
a
beer
not
common
in
my
country
try
this
by
a
friend
of
mine
from
zaragoza
spain
80
recommended
drinkability
seems
to
be
a
sipper
the
taste
made
me
think
i
could
slam
it
the
oily
mouthfeel
is
telling
me
not
too
as
it
is
a
seasonal
beer
for
spring
ill
try
another
one
in
6
months
and
let
you
know
i
love
this
stuff
too
much
ill
take
this
over
any
other
dopple
and
over
almost
any
other
brew
now
that
the
temperature
has
cooled
i
can
turn
to
this
as
my
comfort
beer
cheers
sehr
gutes
dopplebock
brauen
this
bottle
poured
an
amber
brew
with
a
thin
head
its
smell
was
full
of
sweet
malt
the
sweet
taste
was
cloying
with
no
other
taste
to
balance
i
would
find
it
hard
to
drink
two
of
these
this
was
my
first
doppelbock
and
i
gather
that
sweet
malt
goes
with
the
style
this
is
probably
a
beer
that
needs
some
food
to
balance
the
sweetness
pours
a
pretty
garnet
red
with
a
nice
finger
and
a
half
tan
creamy
head
smells
and
tastes
a
little
more
like
i
would
expect
from
a
dopplebock
than
the
tucher
bajuvator
i
had
last
night
some
grainy
malts
caramel
malts
fruity
notes
and
an
alcohol
bite
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
not
harsh
body
is
medium
quite
drinkable
for
7
5
as
well
a
nice
beer
here
opinion
i
really
like
this
beer
and
it
is
one
that
i
drink
often
i
personally
prefer
the
darker
and
richer
doppelbocks
but
this
beer
is
a
hallmark
of
the
style
so
i
just
have
to
enjoy
one
frequently
just
for
its
place
in
history
a
fine
brew
and
i
highly
recommend
it
what
a
great
aroma
salvator
features
a
big
malt
and
light
hop
aromas
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
garnet
red
with
a
big
long
lasting
creamy
head
my
tounge
was
coated
with
big
caramel
malt
flavor
with
some
roast
and
hop
bitterness
salvator
is
very
full
bodied
with
pleasant
carbonation
quite
mouthfilling
outstanding
not
sure
but
it
might
be
dated
1104
pours
a
dark
brown
in
color
with
some
nice
carbonation
and
head
theres
a
nice
ring
of
lacing
through
out
nice
scents
of
sweet
malt
carameltoffee
theres
a
very
nice
sweet
taste
and
a
medium
body
to
this
brew
this
is
a
highly
recommended
brew
which
is
very
drinkable
imho
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
overall
ive
heard
many
say
that
salvator
is
the
best
dopelbock
around
for
the
money
maybe
so
but
in
my
opinion
id
rather
pay
the
extra
for
celebrator
just
an
average
brew
in
my
opinion
its
a
drinkable
beer
for
me
but
for
someone
who
doesnt
drink
a
lot
you
might
not
want
to
make
it
your
session
beer
update
ok
just
had
the
celebrator
last
night
review
forthcoming
and
must
say
its
not
the
style
of
this
i
did
not
care
for
it
was
this
beer
in
particular
as
i
loved
the
celebrator
pours
a
dark
amber
copper
color
with
a
white
lacy
head
smell
is
dark
carmel
malt
taste
is
of
complex
malt
finished
of
with
some
light
hop
sweetness
goes
down
smooth
for
such
a
dark
beer
definitly
a
quality
beer
one
i
will
be
sure
to
enjoy
again
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
always
on
tap
at
the
local
german
bar
a
dark
brown
beer
with
a
small
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
caramelized
through
a
long
hard
boil
leaving
trails
of
complexity
and
enjoyment
finished
off
by
a
nice
noble
hop
spice
that
gives
a
little
tartness
to
all
the
sweetness
very
drinkable
and
when
the
serve
them
in
1
liter
steins
the
room
can
get
fuzzy
fast
drinkability
is
very
good
for
a
beer
this
strong
watch
out
the
beers
strong
aftertaste
doesnt
last
edit
just
resampled
this
brew
august
13
05
and
enjoyed
it
more
as
i
suspect
my
palate
is
expanding
a
bit
noticed
more
of
the
smokeburnt
smell
and
taste
and
enjoyed
it
overall
another
exceptional
beer
from
paulaner
one
not
to
be
missed
a
good
beer
that
i
found
difficult
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
evening
best
left
to
the
colder
months
this
is
a
great
traditional
doppel
bock
what
i
compare
all
other
doppel
bocks
to
looks
solid
brown
with
ruby
and
golden
highlights
has
medium
dense
head
that
may
fade
but
should
lace
well
smells
carmelly
and
malty
toasty
and
fruity
of
sweet
dark
fruits
like
figs
dates
and
a
bit
nutty
low
buttery
that
gives
body
molassas
and
brown
sugar
that
is
offset
by
alcoholic
heat
and
hop
balance
firm
medium
body
that
is
unwavering
and
just
under
creamy
finishes
crisp
and
sweet
abrupt
bittering
gives
way
to
sweetness
that
lingers
alcohoic
throughout
a
well
balanced
and
matured
beer
always
a
treat
a
very
nice
doppelbock
though
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
andechs
doppel
in
my
mind
liplicking
goodness
final
thought
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
before
you
go
to
bed
not
extremely
heavy
like
a
weizen
but
it
clearly
gets
the
job
done
on
a
second
note
this
is
my
very
first
review
on
ba
so
i
hope
i
covered
all
the
basics
d
good
beer
much
better
than
the
other
doppel
bock
i
reviewed
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
by
this
beer
very
nice
poured
out
to
a
gold
auburn
color
with
a
nice
white
faomy
head
no
lace
noted
aromas
of
caramel
and
fruits
were
present
and
a
touch
malty
flavor
was
quite
smooth
with
overtones
of
roasted
sugar
malt
and
fermented
grapes
or
plumbs
also
had
a
brandy
like
aftertaste
nice
mouthfeel
but
was
slightly
weak
aftertaste
and
finish
were
sweet
with
a
slight
bite
not
bad
if
you
can
find
this
brew
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
try
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
you
would
need
to
stretch
it
out
over
a
period
of
time
preferably
matched
with
some
food
also
i
dont
think
id
want
more
than
one
in
a
night
salvator
would
definitely
do
better
with
less
alcoholic
bite
and
without
making
my
mouth
feel
coated
in
syrup
paulaner
never
fails
me
so
i
picked
this
up
with
high
expectations
tastes
very
sweet
and
feels
syrupy
in
the
mouth
high
alcohol
content
goes
unnoticed
in
the
taste
but
extremely
fruity
flavor
makes
this
one
too
much
like
a
slurpy
for
me
a
good
beer
but
i
doubt
ill
buy
it
again
wow
dopplebocks
are
where
it
is
at
color
is
reddishcopper
like
an
old
indianhead
penny
your
grandpa
saved
for
ya
very
creamy
1
finger
head
that
doesnt
give
up
too
easily
if
let
set
for
a
while
if
you
can
wait
smell
is
malty
malty
malty
you
can
catch
the
scent
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
as
well
hop
bittering
is
not
absent
but
somewhat
understated
too
sweet
and
too
thick
for
me
this
is
definetely
a
one
or
two
in
a
night
kind
of
beer
as
it
is
a
little
sweet
and
heavy
but
it
is
a
truly
tasty
and
interesting
adventure
in
malt
imbibement
dn
perhaps
not
as
complex
as
a
celebrator
dopplebock
the
malts
while
sweet
and
tasy
could
have
done
with
a
little
more
depth
still
a
very
tasty
beer
and
very
drinkable
not
a
beer
for
a
dedicated
hop
head
this
beer
is
right
in
line
for
someone
who
likes
a
rich
malty
beer
recommended
great
beer
that
im
still
developing
a
taste
for
poured
a
tannish
thin
bubbly
head
about
half
a
finger
high
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
there
is
no
lace
apparent
so
far
the
aroma
is
fairly
strong
and
noticeable
with
hints
of
fruit
grapes
and
a
slight
alcohol
smell
the
taste
is
similar
kind
of
grapey
and
alcoholic
the
carbonation
is
high
giving
a
lasting
aftertaste
that
accompanies
the
slight
maltiness
and
coffee
flavors
on
the
palate
drinkability
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
more
flavor
than
i
thought
this
one
would
have
not
quite
the
thickness
of
a
primo
doppel
but
at
the
very
least
its
a
pretty
good
standby
to
most
full
bodied
strong
but
smooth
serious
beer
just
had
this
one
again
and
i
find
it
to
be
a
bit
more
drinkable
i
cant
put
this
one
down
also
i
feel
the
smell
now
is
more
than
good
it
is
a
beautiful
smelling
beer
delicious
as
always
but
still
very
complex
such
a
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
the
sweet
malts
still
blow
me
away
in
this
one
a
delicious
doppelbock
and
one
that
is
surprisingly
more
drinkable
than
i
remembered
awesome
pours
a
nice
brownishred
color
that
didnt
have
much
of
a
head
on
it
but
had
some
carbonated
bubbles
it
has
a
very
nice
malty
caramel
smell
to
it
has
a
strong
malty
coffee
like
taste
that
is
actually
very
good
you
can
really
feel
the
strong
alcohol
presence
to
it
overall
this
is
an
excellent
brew
that
you
can
drink
in
moderation
this
is
one
doppelbock
that
everyone
should
try
overall
this
is
a
damned
good
beer
and
one
i
plan
on
enjoying
again
great
for
the
worlds
original
doppel
bock
im
impressed
drinkability
very
good
in
moderation
not
a
high
volume
consumption
beer
but
that
is
fine
i
will
probably
have
this
again
but
not
until
late
fallwinter
i
dont
think
i
would
enjoy
this
as
much
in
the
summer
heat
this
was
my
first
exposure
to
the
wonderful
world
of
dopplebocks
since
then
ive
had
many
and
ill
still
pick
korbinian
or
celebrator
over
this
still
its
a
tried
and
true
classic
and
holds
fond
memories
as
one
of
the
first
beers
ive
had
which
led
me
down
the
wonderful
halls
of
beerdom
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
cant
believe
its
taken
me
so
long
to
review
it
i
remember
this
beer
from
my
early
days
of
burgeoning
beer
enlightenment
clear
rubybrown
body
with
a
small
tight
khaki
head
nose
of
rich
sweet
malts
caramel
stewed
fruit
jam
and
a
light
spicy
vegetal
hop
presence
taste
is
sweet
caramelly
cookie
malt
with
notes
of
fruit
and
brandy
mildly
spicy
noble
hop
finish
lasting
bitterness
with
a
sweetbread
edge
fullbodied
thick
not
quite
liquid
bread
though
a
very
good
db
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
fast
on
this
alone
throw
in
some
celebrator
bayern
and
autumnal
fire
and
then
maybe
drinkability
is
very
good
on
this
easy
drinking
doppel
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
and
this
one
goes
down
very
well
this
is
one
of
my
favourite
doppelbock
because
it
opens
up
with
increasing
complexity
with
every
sip
easier
drinking
than
celebrator
it
shows
its
versatility
with
meat
and
game
lots
of
sweetness
is
eased
off
if
the
bottle
is
cellared
for
six
months
to
a
year
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
rich
and
creamy
very
pleasant
to
sip
and
savor
probably
wouldnt
want
to
drink
too
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
another
good
candidate
beer
that
would
do
good
with
a
little
proper
aging
i
feel
a
rich
creamy
body
that
flows
over
the
palate
nicely
very
full
and
satisfying
this
is
quite
a
nice
doppelbock
and
one
ill
be
having
again
in
the
future
a
nice
example
of
the
style
salvator
is
a
different
sort
of
doppelbock
for
all
i
know
though
it
might
be
the
standard
bearer
for
the
style
it
was
good
and
the
bottle
was
empty
almost
before
i
knew
it
but
the
word
great
never
even
crossed
my
mind
this
outstanding
beer
pours
a
golden
brown
from
the
bottle
with
a
fluffy
head
that
quickly
dissipated
smells
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
raisins
taste
is
excellent
big
bold
malt
flavor
as
expected
with
a
delightfully
smooth
finish
that
7
5
abv
sneaks
up
on
you
the
golden
standard
against
which
most
doppelbocks
are
measured
yeah
what
everyone
else
said

except
for
2
reviewers
finally
got
to
quaff
the
standard
among
dbocks
exceptional
brew
beautiful
amber
brown
pour
with
tan
head
very
lacy
malty
sweet
with
a
hop
balance
and
finish
nice
alcohol
presence
to
counter
the
sweetness
wifey
said
it
tasted
like
whisky

very

medium

thick

very
satisfying
and
filling
this
is
a
classic
to
measure
against
orangedark
copper
body
with
slight
carbonation
good
offwhite
head
smells
sweet
a
bit
bread
dough
like
and
a
hint
of
fruit
as
for
tatse
i
can
detect
a
bit
of
the
grain
up
front
and
an
overall
sweet
and
slightly
fruity
taste
with
a
minor
smokey
finish
mild
alcohol
in
the
middle
excellent
ballance
i
like
the
complexity
but
on
the
other
hand
this
beer
is
not
too
complex
because
i
can
still
pick
all
of
the
flavors
apart
mild
overall
hops
presence
mouthfeel
is
watery
at
first
refreshing
but
then
leaves
an
oily
coating
as
it
evaporates
in
the
mouth
awesome
ballance
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
and
makes
this
highly
drinkable
sure
ive
had
better
but
this
is
still
a
hell
of
a
dopplebock
an
amber
colored
brew
with
a
one
finger
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
the
aroma
is
outstanding
grassy
like
a
fresh
mowed
hayfield
becoming
sweeter
as
it
warms
and
alcoholic
when
warm
and
agitated
tastes
of
rich
malts
and
the
same
grassiness
as
the
nose
herbal
and
floral
much
more
malt
dominant
as
it
warms
and
alcoholic
when
rolled
around
on
the
tongue
great
session
beer
medium
bodied
and
a
little
carbonation
just
right
abv
my
favorite
doppelbock
comments
doppelbock
is
just
not
my
style
of
choice
by
my
estimation
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
i
just
cant
get
really
excited
about
it
ive
had
this
beer
a
few
times
in
the
past
and
just
never
put
pen
to
paper
pours
a
deep
copperlight
red
color
good
head
retention
and
sticky
lace
the
head
clumps
as
you
drink
it
smells
carmelly
and
sweet
taste
is
carmelly
munich
malt
up
front
spicy
herbal
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
lucious
i
could
down
these
all
night
if
it
wasnt
7
5
this
beer
is
a
beautiful
medium
dark
amber
with
a
decentsized
offwhite
mostly
diminishing
frothy
head
and
only
a
little
lacing
early
the
aroma
is
pungent
and
sweet
caramel
maltiness
is
strong
followed
by
bready
smokey
and
fruity
scents
the
taste
is
like
i
like
them
big
and
malty
theres
a
wonderful
candied
fruitiness
of
raspberry
and
plum
and
a
pleasant
little
hop
bitterness
the
finish
is
longlasting
and
sweet
with
bit
of
alcohol
kind
of
like
a
tawny
port
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
oily
and
syrupy
but
still
thinner
and
lighter
in
body
than
i
thought
it
would
be
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
think
that
drinkability
is
high
though
most
would
probably
consider
this
to
mealy
and
strong
but
i
would
recommend
trying
this
one
drinkability

this
is
a
raw
edgy
doppelbock
which
is
just
the
way
that
i
like
em
it
is
true
to
the
style
and
exceptionally
creamy
in
the
mouth
i
was
somewhat
impressed
by
this
paulaner
offering
500ml
bottle
pours
a
goldenbrown
with
ruby
tints
that
sports
a
healthy
head
that
lingers
for
a
while
a
very
roasty
aroma
speaks
of
caramel
raisins
plums
and
toasted
sourdough
bread
taste
has
a
little
more
hops
than
your
average
bock
if
you
ask
me
which
i
enjoy
balances
out
the
malts
again
the
caramel
raisins
mild
hints
of
grapefruit
a
bit
of
bite
in
the
mouthfeel
and
just
right
on
the
carbonation
could
use
a
bit
more
pepperyness
for
my
taste
not
my
favorite
style
but
for
the
style
i
think
its
a
great
widely
available
beer
pretty
drinkable
also
a
500ml
bottle
will
warm
you
up
nicely
500
ml
bottle
with
something
that
looks
like
a
freshness
date
or
a
batch
number
on
the
front
label
pours
into
the
chalice
a
deep
reddishbrown
with
a
1
finger
head
that
reduces
to
almost
nothing
and
leaves
little
lacing
scents
are
bubblegum
diacetyl
golden
raisins
and
caramel
tastes
are
alcohol
diacetyl
sweet
malts
and
bitterness
that
is
there
but
overshadowed
by
the
other
flavors
tastes
good
but
almost
too
sweet
and
the
alcohol
is
very
prevalent
which
both
lower
the
taste
score
beer
is
thick
and
smooth
leaving
a
warming
sensation
as
it
goes
down
good
but
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
bottle
of
this
at
a
time
perhaps
cellaring
a
bottle
for
a
few
months
might
help
i
liked
this
beer
but
it
didnt
strike
me
as
one
that
id
buy
all
the
time
or
keep
around
the
house
i
do
like
it
enough
that
ill
get
one
in
town
and
try
it
again
who
knows
could
be
an
old
bottle
that
got
too
many
temperature
changes
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
i
had
a
salvator
and
after
having
one
this
weekend
i
can
honestly
say
i
have
no
clue
why
this
brew
pours
to
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
think
off
white
head
tan
head
that
breaks
down
relatively
slowly
very
nice
looking
it
left
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
through
out
the
entire
brew
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
with
a
sweetness
from
the
malt
which
is
probably
leading
to
the
notice
of
caramel
or
toffee
smell
that
is
excellent
the
taste
is
very
much
dominated
by
the
malt
giving
it
a
sweet
flavor
that
gives
way
to
a
keen
spicinessbitterness
ending
with
slight
alcohol
flavor
this
is
a
nice
brew
and
must
thank
the
friend
who
left
here
the
previous
weekend
pours
a
deep
clear
cherrycopper
with
a
formidable
beigered
head
moderate
lacing
smells
nicely
sugary
with
a
big
amount
of
raisin
to
the
nose
has
all
the
wonderful
depth
of
flavor
one
would
expect
from
a
big
malty
beast
like
this
brown
sugar
plum
fig
raisin
its
all
there
finishes
with
a
syrupy
slickness
that
i
just
love
its
a
keeper
never
had
fried
turkey
sad
i
havent
had
that
many
doppelbocks
but
this
has
vaulted
towards
the
top
of
the
listand
why
shouldnt
it
its
the
granddaddy
of
them
all
pours
a
dark
coppery
red
with
a
tan
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
aroma
of
toffee
with
a
twinge
of
alcohol
with
a
bit
of
hops
as
it
warmed
some
cherry
and
winey
as
well
taste
was
an
amazing
roasted
malt
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
entering
quickly
very
malty
on
the
finish
as
well
and
quite
rich
and
smooth
the
alcohol
is
rather
well
hidden
but
not
completely
hidden
this
is
good
but
certainly
not
the
best
ive
had
still
easy
to
find
and
easy
drinking
cheers
salvator
doppelbock
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
its
quite
easy
to
drink
several
in
a
sitting
but
the
boomerang
effect
might
hurt
this
is
the
classic
doppel
bock
and
a
must
for
someone
trying
to
figure
out
what
these
bocks
taste
like
but
is
does
not
push
the
envleope
enough
for
me
i
prefer
bigger
beers
in
aroma
taste
and
alcohol
yummy
paulaner
and
erdinger
have
always
been
two
of
my
favourite
larger
breweries
in
germany
sniffing
from
the
bottle
after
popping
the
cap
i
get
a
very
peculiar
leathery
seasoning
salt
smell
a
creamcoloured
almost
light
red
head
forms
about
4
cm
leaving
healthy
thick
patches
of
lace
the
beer
is
almost
red
but
more
of
a
dark
orange
and
extremely
clear
the
head
narrows
to
a
thin
but
fine
covering
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
extremely
salty
i
get
massive
whiffs
of
seasoningsalt
here
leathery
chemicallike
extremely
unique
i
smell
tomatojuice
and
celery
salt
some
of
the
smells
are
hard
to
define
i
do
get
some
redmalt
aroma
some
butterscotch
and
very
pungent
acidity
the
taste
is
not
half
as
full
or
mysterious
as
the
aroma
might
suggest
instead
of
much
spiciness
i
get
more
of
the
leathery
malt
and
some
astringent
sour
properties
and
some
basic
caramel
malt
in
the
finish
some
taste
akin
to
barbeque
sauce
or
tomato
juice
sweet
malt
more
salinity
butter
metallic
notes
sour
cheese
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
quite
oily
and
dry
but
very
full
this
was
not
my
favourite
beer
when
i
first
tried
it
a
couple
of
years
ago
but
it
has
grown
on
me
especially
after
trying
many
different
barleywines
and
old
ales
i
would
still
not
drink
more
than
two
of
these
in
a
night
equally
out
of
respect
for
its
taste
and
its
strong
gravity
a
solid
version
of
the
style
pretty
much
the
standard
for
doppelbocks
great
aromas
good
flavors
but
not
as
smooth
as
i
would
have
liked
overall
an
average
beer
but
nothing
impressive
beer
is
good
happy
beering
this
is
one
badass
doppelbock
many
others
are
too
thick
and
sweet
for
me
but
this
one
strikes
a
perfect
balance
the
apperance
was
great
with
a
nice
reddish
brown
color
and
great
head
the
smell
was
a
bit
subtle
but
i
could
detect
some
nice
cinnamon
and
sweet
fruit
scents
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
out
of
this
world
sweet
malts
dominate
most
of
the
flavor
profile
but
not
in
a
way
that
makes
it
undrinkable
and
there
is
a
great
dryhoppy
character
in
the
finnish
that
perfectly
balances
out
the
maltiness
of
the
front
end
a
extremley
drinkable
doppel
goes
along
side
the
celebrator
as
my
favorite
beers
of
the
style
i
recall
paulaner
being
one
of
the
few
foreign
beers
sold
in
chile
especially
in
the
south
from
their
german
heritage
but
its
widely
known
and
drunk
down
there
poured
in
a
goblet
paulaner
salvator
appears
an
ambercoppery
colour
nice
to
look
at
unfortunately
the
head
is
a
pathetic
film
that
disipates
to
nothing
lace
is
barely
their
just
some
strips
of
bubbles
smells
of
caramel
malts
some
fruit
and
earth
taste
starts
out
sweet
caramel
sweet
malts
and
dark
fruits
middle
is
kind
of
earthy
like
dirt
but
in
a
good
way
aftertaste
is
bittersweet
as
it
warms
it
becomes
much
more
earthy
and
hoppy
nice
sharp
and
bitter
aftertase
and
the
sweetness
becomes
more
mellow
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
and
light
little
if
any
of
a
carbonated
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
good
beer
i
can
drink
again
maybe
not
alot
in
one
sitting
but
thats
what
makes
it
a
good
beer
its
too
complex
to
be
quaffed
taste
was
full
of
flavor
big
carmel
taste
upfront
with
a
fruity
taste
after
cherry
hard
candy
like
flavors
as
well
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
along
with
a
nice
bitterness
big
off
white
head
that
goes
away
fast
smell
is
big
and
malty
taste
is
really
sweet
with
a
large
carmel
base
this
feels
extreamly
thick
in
the
mouth
wouldnt
guess
that
by
looking
at
it
the
sweetness
makes
finishing
the
bottle
a
chore
i
usually
enjoy
heavy
beers
but
there
is
something
odd
about
this
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
is
rich
and
malty
some
toasted
malt
bready
aromas
with
caramel
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
also
malty
with
more
caramel
sweetness
some
fruity
flavors
present
as
well
such
as
banana
and
cherry
a
bit
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
very
strong
yet
smooth
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
a
7
5
brew
a
good
example
of
the
doppelbock
style
solid
juicy
malt
aroma
smells
so
damn
good
orange
colored
beer
towards
the
bottom
of
the
weizen
glass
but
more
of
a
rubymahoganny
at
the
top
pretty
cool
effect
if
you
ask
me
fine
bubbled
dark
cream
colored
head
fades
slowly
to
a
film
leaving
strings
of
lace
along
the
way
malt
from
the
aroma
is
very
weak
in
the
flavor
and
quickly
overpowered
by
a
mildly
bitter
and
slightly
alcoholic
taste
finish
is
bordering
on
dry
not
the
juicy
malt
bomb
i
was
expecting
didnt
know
much
about
the
beer
beforehand
but
upon
pouring
it
looked
good
smelled
great
the
taste
was
dissapointing
and
it
turned
into
a
dissapointment
very
good
mouthfeel
lightly
carbonated
and
a
bit
creamy
make
an
excellent
combination
this
beer
is
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
this
brew
smells
way
better
than
it
tastes
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
definitely
pleasing
drinkability
is
great
for
its
strength
drinkability
is
just
fine
the
full
but
not
overdone
carbonation
of
the
beer
gives
it
a
medium
body
and
a
crisp
feel
in
the
mouth
a
compact
goldenbrown
head
of
tiny
bubbles
1
deep
tops
off
this
pour
and
does
a
pretty
good
job
of
sticking
around
beer
is
chestnut
in
color
with
orangish
highlights
fairly
translucent
and
medium
in
viscosity
sweet
smells
of
toffee
buttered
wheat
dough
and
gingerbread
spices
suggestions
of
maple
syrup
carry
over
into
the
flavor
although
the
main
focus
is
still
on
toffee
and
butter
dense
flavors
of
allspice
and
cinnamon
prevent
the
mellow
rich
sweetness
from
ever
becoming
cloying
walnutskin
dryness
at
the
roof
of
the
mouth
leads
into
an
aftertaste
that
recalls
caraway
seeds
and
woodsy
hops
this
is
happily
bitterer
than
i
had
expected
no
tangible
carbonation
to
a
mouthfeel
that
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
in
body
and
drier
than
the
aroma
would
suggest
drinkable
but
the
alcohol
level
makes
this
relaxing
enough
to
enjoy
one
at
a
timewhich
is
probably
the
point
no
complaints
has
a
dark
clean
amber
body
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
an
inviting
malt
sweetness
with
some
tabacco
in
the
background
the
taste
has
a
yummy
toffee
malt
sweetness
at
the
start
and
a
dry
licorice
finish
there
is
something
in
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
that
make
you
want
to
keep
taking
mouthfull
after
mouthfull
maybe
im
just
relishing
the
style
the
defunct
microbrewer
i
worked
for
in
ohio
made
a
delicious
dopplebock
for
the
bar
trade
in
dayton
brewmaster
steve
betts
where
are
you
bottom
line
though
toned
down
this
is
still
a
very
solid
and
well
made
doppelbock
quite
enjoyable
actually
but
a
bit
light
for
the
style
12
its
very
easy
drinking
and
smooth
wonderfully
made
wow
poured
with
a
rich
toffee
brown
colour
and
a
tight
fluffy
white
head
aromas
of
rich
dark
malt
mollasses
alcohol
and
toffee
tasted
of
a
toffee
sweetness
a
huge
malt
backbone
evident
alcohol
and
a
dry
longlasting
finish
with
slight
hints
of
licquorice
the
epitomy
of
the
doppel
bock
style
cascading
into
my
paulaner
weissbier
glass
salvator
stretches
his
arms
and
presents
a
lovely
amount
of
carbonation
as
well
as
a
distinctive
creamcolored
head
lovely
coppery
sunset
color
to
the
brew
sweet
malt
backbone
fruity
esters
minimal
although
meaningful
german
hop
presence
almost
champagne
like
in
its
effervescence
refreshing
as
well
as
satisfying
decieving
as
can
be
for
a
7
5
abv
ale
my
absolute
favorite
and
a
steal
at
2
59
for
16
9oz
salvator
pours
a
reddish
amber
colour
without
too
much
head
that
recedes
quickly
without
much
lacing
the
smell
is
stong
and
malty
and
smells
like
caramel
sweet
and
rich
the
taste
also
has
strong
hints
of
caramel
and
quite
sweet
and
malty
this
beer
really
tastes
great
like
a
rich
dessert
you
get
after
a
nice
meal
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
i
dont
detect
any
hop
bitterness
and
the
style
of
beer
does
not
make
for
the
greatest
drinkability
i
cant
see
myself
using
this
as
a
session
beer
only
a
few
at
a
time
really
want
to
savor
them
with
thanksgiving
just
around
the
corner
this
is
going
to
be
a
great
beer
for
cool
fall
days
truly
a
classic
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
espcially
when
fall
rolls
around
a
week
or
two
may
pass
without
me
buying
one
but
its
a
rare
month
when
i
dont
at
least
have
a
couple
on
cold
latefall
nights
by
the
gas
fireplace
with
one
of
the
cats
in
my
glass
i
love
to
have
a
full
liter
glass
of
salvator
nice
red
amber
color
and
a
sudsy
beige
head
sweet
malty
aroma
with
odd
hints
of
citrus
taste
is
sweet
malty
and
faintly
acetic
decent
but
definitely
a
rung
or
two
below
the
likes
of
spaten
optimator
weltenburger
and
celebrator
on
the
doppelbock
ladder
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
copper
with
a
thick
light
cream
head
slight
hints
of
fruit
and
caramel
to
the
nose
but
the
smell
of
alchohol
is
the
most
predominant
a
fairly
complex
and
flavorful
mix
that
becomes
sweeter
and
smokier
as
it
warms
easy
to
kick
back
a
few
pints
and
with
a
abv
of
7
5
you
wont
need
to
drink
to
many
more
mouthfeel
is
medium
smooth
and
wellrounded
finishes
clean
its
sweetness
limits
its
drinkability
more
than
anything
else
but
not
by
much
this
is
the
beer
that
opened
my
tastebuds
to
a
whole
new
world
of
beer
and
started
my
beer
quest
i
drank
it
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
munich
and
fell
in
love
with
it
now
that
i
have
tasted
a
lot
of
other
beers
ill
need
to
return
to
the
brewery
and
relive
the
experience
with
a
much
more
welltravelled
palate
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
ruby
highlight
not
much
of
a
head
but
then
i
made
the
mistake
of
pouring
it
in
a
seasoned
glass
smell
is
malty
malty
malty
caramel
dark
bread
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
well
a
bit
more
than
a
touch
not
really
hops
around
to
dry
it
out
but
that
isnt
what
this
bier
is
for
its
rich
and
tasty
carbonation
is
low
given
the
abv
you
cant
have
too
many
of
these
however
its
a
good
brew
pair
it
with
roast
duck
and
red
cabbage
or
sauerbraten
and
spaetzle
its
tasty
and
unnoticed
poured
very
clear
and
very
red
in
colour
with
almost
no
head
at
all
decent
lacing
however
the
smell
is
absolutely
fantastic
very
sweet
bready
and
a
little
bit
of
a
raisin
like
aroma
as
well
the
taste
too
is
quite
sweet
not
too
sweet
just
more
so
than
i
had
expected
the
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
although
there
is
quite
a
bit
more
carbonation
in
this
than
i
would
have
thought
there
to
be
not
my
style
but
not
bad
either
paulaner
does
a
good
job
on
keeping
the
7
5abv
on
a
leash
on
this
stuff
its
really
not
that
noticeable
tastewise
anyway
something
else
id
like
to
add
there
is
an
interesting
quite
tasty
maple
syrup
like
aftertaste
that
shows
up
about
2
seconds
after
you
take
a
sip
nice
300
ml
brown
bottle
with
freshness
date
clearly
marked
on
the
label
all
and
all
this
was
a
quite
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
i
think
it
would
go
great
with
fish
and
chicken
or
hell
just
drink
it
to
talk
about
it
first
want
to
think
aracauna
with
his
help
with
my
atlanta
trip
where
i
aquired
my
salvator
havent
had
this
in
years
but
enjoyed
it
while
in
co
pre
ba
days
a
lot
pours
a
clear
amber
with
brownish
tints
head
falls
to
a
thin
cap
of
foam
no
lace
to
speak
of
aroma
is
malt
fruit
apples
mainly
hints
of
caramel
spice
taste
is
mallllty
and
complex
big
on
malt
molassas
caramel
with
fruits
flavors
present
along
with
a
nice
dose
of
hops
this
is
a
good
doppelbock
not
as
thick
as
some
but
a
good
medium
bodied
brew
that
is
really
drinkable
this
is
a
good
brew
not
as
great
as
i
thought
it
was
from
memory
but
still
a
great
beer
a
beautiful
amber
beer
that
smells
of
sweet
malts
and
lots
of
them
there
is
little
head
and
no
lacing
to
speak
of
but
this
seems
to
be
the
norm
for
this
style
its
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
the
malt
is
a
bit
subdued
for
a
doppel
bock
but
it
only
makes
the
beer
that
much
easier
to
enjoy
the
germans
know
how
to
brew
beer
well
their
way
and
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
drinkability
very
a
kick
ass
brew
and
a
style
that
im
definitely
going
to
have
to
do
more
research
on
wink
wink
check
this
beer
out
its
a
good
one
orange
amber
aroma
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
that
was
gone
before
i
was
able
to
put
the
empty
bottle
in
the
trash
aroma
is
very
malty
with
a
wood
roasted
grain
tone
that
is
a
bit
striking
there
were
also
notes
of
orangey
hops
the
taste
is
robustly
sweet
with
a
smoky
peaty
background
supplemented
by
vanilla
apples
and
oak
the
hops
are
floral
and
peppery
but
are
definitely
playing
second
fiddle
here
the
body
feels
a
lot
thicker
in
the
mouth
than
the
appearance
first
suggests
the
alcohol
is
apparent
from
the
beginning
and
detracts
a
bit
from
drinkability
the
father
of
the
dopplebock
style
does
not
live
to
the
initial
expectation
as
it
has
been
surpassed
by
a
more
talented
child
i
e
celebrator
great
to
sip
slowly
definitely
a
nice
doppel
bock
comes
in
500ml
brown
bottle
with
with
a
slightly
different
label
than
the
ba
picture
shows
pours
a
nice
vibrant
cherryish
amber
with
a
shortlasting
sticky
white
head
deep
beautiful
aroma
of
malt
malt
and
more
malt
essence
of
molasses
cherry
caramel
and
alcohol
sweet
palate
contains
notes
of
sweet
malt
treacle
biscuit
and
sweet
fruit
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
then
reaches
up
and
smacks
you
on
the
top
of
the
head
rich
thick
slightly
syrupy
body
had
trouble
finishing
the
bottle
by
myself
you
have
to
watch
the
7
5
abv
nevertheless
im
a
fan
this
may
have
been
one
of
the
1st
dopplebocks
i
ever
drank
and
it
is
still
one
of
my
favorites
i
believe
paulaner
continuously
puts
out
great
german
beer
the
color
is
a
deep
brownred
it
pours
with
just
a
bit
of
a
head
and
a
lace
when
drinking
the
aroma
is
a
heavenly
blend
of
malt
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
a
complex
mix
of
the
malt
maybe
a
little
caramel
and
the
alcohol
on
the
back
end
as
with
all
beers
of
this
style
i
think
it
is
difficult
to
drink
more
than
2
or
3
but
this
is
a
great
beer
pours
a
gorgeous
cheery
wood
dark
amber
with
a
phenomenal
tannish
head
that
is
magnificent
lacing
is
excellent
the
smell
is
strong
of
fruitiness
and
traces
of
alcohol
strong
cider
apple
with
not
bitterness
to
speak
of
no
hops
present
the
taste
was
very
dissapointing
it
was
to
sweet
to
syrupy
strong
with
no
hop
bitterness
to
blend
it
all
together
it
was
like
sucking
on
apple
syrup
that
is
great
on
pancakes
but
not
in
a
beer
glass
nice
medium
bodied
smooth
feel
but
the
taste
of
this
does
not
refect
what
i
want
in
a
beer
i
made
the
mistake
of
drinking
it
too
quickly
it
needs
to
warm
up
a
bit
before
it
loses
its
bite
once
it
does
so
its
a
phenomenal
beer
i
was
stunned
by
its
lack
of
bitterness
almost
fruity
and
light
goes
down
too
easy
i
couldve
had
a
bunch
of
these
best
with
a
heavy
meal
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
taste
hits
you
in
several
layers
great
color
the
heads
not
as
big
as
i
would
like
although
i
may
have
poured
it
cooler
than
it
should
be
smell
is
very
malty
maybe
a
little
caramel
as
others
have
said
taste
is
pretty
complex
a
lot
going
on
starts
with
sweet
malt
then
a
little
hops
almost
spicy
then
maybe
a
little
of
the
sour
apple
that
venom
mentioned
i
cant
exactly
put
my
finger
on
the
taste
so
thats
as
close
as
i
can
get
followed
with
caramel
and
a
little
bitterness
for
the
long
finish
good
mouthfeel
really
sticks
around
although
maybe
thinner
than
i
would
prefer
drinkability
would
be
around
one
or
two
at
the
end
of
the
night
not
my
session
brew
but
a
great
nightcap
thx
taste
is
good
but
not
great
the
astringency
is
there
with
some
alcohol
overtones
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
malt
sweetness
and
find
myself
wanting
more
an
excellent
brew
for
sure
but
the
celebrator
is
much
more
my
style
that
said
i
would
never
turn
one
of
these
down
if
offered
one
one
of
the
beers
on
this
planet
that
any
discerning
beer
drinker
has
to
have
tried
salvator
is
one
of
the
benchmarks
for
the
style
many
have
endevored
to
copy
this
little
beauty
and
not
come
within
an
elephants
trumpet
of
succeeding
if
you
havent
had
this
and
have
the
good
fortune
to
come
across
it
it
should
be
purchased
and
consumed
no
questions
asked
imho
this
is
the
dopplebock
i
cant
imagine
how
it
could
be
any
better
absolutely
fantastic
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
period
i
think
a
beer
like
this
would
go
better
in
colder
weather
than
in
the
humidity
of
a
houston
summer
i
will
return
to
this
beer
again
in
colder
weather
and
see
how
i
feel
then
pours
with
a
twofinger
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
some
lace
deep
clear
amber
color
low
carbonation
nose
is
malty
medium
bodied
starts
sweet
very
smooth
the
high
abv
is
not
noticable
1
90
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
all
in
all
another
winner
from
the
folks
at
paulaner
this
is
a
bit
off
of
the
beaten
path
for
a
doppelbock
but
id
say
give
it
go
if
you
come
across
it
its
a
different
take
on
a
timehonored
and
sometimes
all
too
predictable
style
this
is
on
the
pale
side
of
doppelbock
its
a
dark
tan
and
not
really
very
clear
its
got
a
good
head
though
the
almost
prune
aroma
and
flavor
dominates
with
a
sweet
caramel
backup
its
not
too
heavy
but
packs
a
definate
punch
it
does
get
a
bit
sweet
but
not
so
much
so
that
i
had
trouble
finishing
off
a
half
liter
salvator
is
a
good
beer
rather
complex
perhaps
something
that
would
take
getting
used
to
definately
not
something
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
but
seems
like
it
would
make
a
great
beer
to
have
on
a
cold
night
pours
out
a
clear
golden
mahogony
color
with
a
hefty
light
brown
head
aroma
is
very
sweet
malty
with
almost
a
beef
jerky
type
aroma
nice
spicy
alcohol
aroma
unfortunately
the
taste
is
not
as
full
as
the
aroma
it
seems
most
flavors
are
in
the
background
starts
off
with
a
smooth
mild
maltiness
along
with
some
somewhat
blandish
cardboard
type
taste
the
taste
is
in
the
finish
where
the
maltiness
turns
sweet
sticky
and
the
alcohol
turns
spicy
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
at
first
then
becomes
syrupy
which
detracts
from
the
drinkability
good
but
give
me
a
korbinian
any
day
this
isnt
the
best
dopplebock
but
it
isnt
objectionable
and
it
is
certainly
drinkable
would
rather
have
a
celebrator
or
even
sam
adams
db
though
the
mouthfeel
was
very
good
on
this
beer
it
was
meaty
and
rich
with
just
enough
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
beer
just
not
my
style
i
want
to
try
celebrator
had
this
one
as
a
dessert
after
a
meal
of
chicken
and
rice
amber
colored
with
a
tremendous
frothy
head
great
smell
apples
and
a
touch
of
caramel
very
sweet
smelling
very
smooth
for
a
doppel
bock
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
as
well
a
very
tasty
beer
very
drinkable
for
a
dopple
bock
i
would
have
this
one
agian
good
beer
immensely
drinkable
could
be
a
session
beer
for
me
if
not
for
the
7
5
abv
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
almost
smells
like
gingerbread
cookies
a
very
pleasant
aroma
the
first
taste
overwhelms
and
i
have
to
go
for
another
to
get
a
grasp
of
it
definitely
a
sweet
bready
taste
a
hint
of
alcohol
can
be
detected
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
seems
a
little
thin
for
a
doppel
bock
not
my
favorite
doppel
bock
but
not
a
bad
drink
quite
drinkable
i
woudl
buy
this
one
again
but
if
i
had
my
choice
i
would
probably
opt
for
celebrator
totally
limpid
copper
hue
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
is
quickly
limited
to
a
ring
honest
malty
aroma
with
a
light
floral
hops
note
mainly
geared
toward
caramel
white
chocolate
cashews
vanilla
and
not
so
wellhidden
alcohol
very
sweet
palate
hazelnuts
and
crème
caramel
licorice
and
marshmallows
interesting
flavor
profile
but
thats
just
because
i
love
the
style
and
this
one
doesnt
have
any
of
the
balancing
elements
smoke
light
bitterness
that
top
examples
like
celebrator
can
boast
about
its
all
about
the
malt
which
can
become
rather
cloying
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
smooth
creamy
medium
body
displaying
particularly
low
carbonation
i
did
not
find
the
complexity
i
was
looking
for
in
this
beer
and
i
thought
the
alcohol
was
more
present
than
it
should
be
it
struck
me
as
around
on
par
with
samuel
adams
double
bock
but
i
still
like
optimator
the
best
out
the
doppelbocks
ive
tried
ive
yet
to
try
aventinus
or
celebrator
a
respectable
brew
by
all
accounts
but
ive
had
better
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
super
crazy
or
anything
it
had
many
great
smells
with
it
as
well
as
tastes
it
was
fairly
sweet
but
still
had
the
bold
malt
flavor
that
is
associated
with
this
style
the
alcohol
was
a
little
strong
for
the
other
tastes
but
it
wasnt
anything
too
unbearable
there
was
the
flavors
of
dull
or
dark
fruits
but
they
kind
of
took
a
side
stage
to
the
malt
i
am
a
big
malt
guy
so
this
was
a
drinkable
beer
to
me
the
head
was
a
little
disappointing
but
i
guess
you
cant
have
everything
all
of
the
time
zum
wohl
a
lot
more
hopsbite
to
this
brew
than
celebrator
not
nearly
as
much
character
or
depth
after
this
comparison
tastetest
im
standing
by
my
earlier
numbers
a
nice
beer
but
too
hoppy
and
lightfeeling
to
stand
with
its
superiors
this
is
a
light
doppelbock
my
first
doppel
picked
it
up
pretty
much
on
a
whim
and
im
glad
i
did
it
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
white
head
that
disappears
pretty
quickly
aroma
is
of
malt
and
alcohol
on
first
taste
the
alcohol
is
definetly
present
but
so
is
a
ton
of
malt
this
is
a
malt
monster
notes
of
raisin
are
also
apparent
mouthfeel
is
decent
i
just
dont
know
how
drinkable
this
one
is
1
will
do
me
for
a
long
time
maybe
its
just
not
my
style
so
i
cant
mark
it
too
low
i
just
picked
up
a
celebrator
so
i
should
have
a
nice
comparison
soon
super
drinkable
a
super
german
bock
beer
notes
i
have
a
personal
predilection
for
sweet
malty
fullbodied
beers
so
doppelbocks
tend
to
be
among
my
favorite
beers
salvator
is
certainly
an
archetype
of
the
style
dark
copper
color
the
beer
is
kind
of
transparent
a
nice
smell
of
coffee
caramel
and
malt
the
taste
is
all
about
malt
very
well
balanced
with
the
7
5
abv
some
sweetness
too
light
hints
of
lemon
some
spices
too
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
the
alcohol
became
more
noticeable
as
i
was
drinking
a
nice
brew
but
i
couldnt
sip
on
that
all
night
long
starts
with
an
oily
mouth
full
of
cocoamalty
sweetness
not
impaired
by
the
detectable
spalter
hops
until
the
finish
which
is
herbal
hop
pronounced
with
the
smokey
roast
coming
in
in
the
final
stages
relatively
clean
finish
for
shich
a
big
lager
but
that
is
part
of
this
bocks
signature
everything
in
moderation
color
is
a
dark
reddish
amber
offwhite
foamy
head
lasts
a
little
while
then
quickly
falls
back
to
a
ring
the
beer
is
very
clear
and
you
can
see
very
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
rising
in
the
liquid
smell
is
pretty
subdued
mostly
malty
with
some
fruit
taste
is
really
good
rich
malty
flavor
and
a
little
sweetness
fruity
top
notes
maybe
raisins
and
some
carmel
finish
includes
a
taste
of
hops
and
alcohol
warmness
a
little
bit
of
banana
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
fine
carbonation
very
drinkable
for
a
7
5
abv
beer
a
very
fine
coppery
body
in
appearance
clear
but
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
that
fizzles
out
quickly
aroma
is
thick
with
bread
butterscotch
and
dried
dates
and
raisins
and
a
boozy
alcohol
presence
is
apparent
although
not
overpowering
flavour
closely
matches
sweet
malt
up
from
with
the
dried
fruit
carrying
through
with
a
buttery
marmalade
middle
and
finishing
with
a
surprising
herbal
hop
finish
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
kick
albeit
a
smooth
kick
full
velvety
mouthfeel
it
is
a
pleasure
to
have
this
roll
over
the
tongue
and
wash
over
the
palate
very
drinkable
for
a
higher
abv
beer
in
the
fact
that
i
could
see
myself
turning
this
one
into
a
sessional
one
that
i
have
no
doubt
i
would
regret
the
next
morning
as
well
as
that
id
reach
for
it
again
the
next
time
i
am
out
beer
shopping
probably
not
a
flagship
doppelbock
but
it
is
mighty
fine
for
what
it
is
and
the
stepping
stone
i
would
use
to
introduce
this
style
to
others
thats
for
sure
drinkability
good
wears
on
you
after
awhile
this
is
still
an
above
average
beer
just
not
exeptional
despite
its
shortcomings
this
beer
is
pretty
good
i
just
dont
think
it
would
be
my
first
choice
mouthfeel
is
lovely
and
rich
classic
for
the
style
quite
drinkable
for
what
it
is
and
a
pleasant
dinner
companion
this
is
a
robust
and
complex
brew
definite
malty
continuance
very
very
caramelly
and
unbelieveably
malty
pretty
hoppy
as
well
awesome
for
the
style
i
thought
this
was
a
drinkable
brew
but
again
not
with
garlic
pizza
overall
impression
as
for
drinkability
the
taste
says
yes
the
thick
mouthfeel
and
alcohol
say
no
this
is
a
meal
and
while
i
want
another
meal
in
a
few
hours
not
another
one
right
now
thanks
i
find
this
is
in
the
same
class
as
a
celebrator
which
is
a
good
class
to
be
in
i
would
recommend
finding
this
one
took
me
awhile
to
get
here
but
i
can
now
appreciate
this
beer
and
its
good
ratings
salvator
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
its
smell
is
malty
and
fruity
it
tastes
winey
with
a
hint
of
malt
grapes
and
raisins
it
has
a
dry
hoppy
finish
it
feels
slightly
oily
and
has
a
nice
light
feel
with
a
dry
finish
that
has
some
hints
of
iron
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
lacks
some
of
the
strength
and
complexity
of
other
double
bocks
very
drinkable
dopplebock
that
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
red
color
with
no
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
but
too
reminiscent
of
fruit
punch
to
be
necessarily
great
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
and
fruity
leading
to
a
sour
fruit
aftertaste
nice
slight
carbonation
and
light
on
the
palate
but
full
in
the
body
a
good
beer
but
has
hardly
any
hoppiness
still
a
good
drinkable
dopplebock
bottle
poured
an
amber
colored
brew
with
a
medium
size
head
retention
is
very
average
as
well
as
the
carbonation
a
bit
of
caramel
and
sweetness
with
an
above
average
body
abv
is
well
hidden
not
the
best
doppelbock
i
have
tasted
but
bot
bad
either
the
flavor
is
a
bit
better
than
that
of
sam
adams
double
bock
but
the
body
and
feel
are
not
quite
as
good
i
could
drink
several
salvators
until
the
7
5
kicked
me
medium
bodied
with
a
full
rich
and
creamy
mouthfeel
would
make
a
great
dessert
beer
but
still
pretty
drinkable
overall
a
just
a
touch
too
sweet
for
my
liking
and
the
alcohol
a
little
too
noticeable
in
your
face
carbonation
and
overthetop
unique
flavour
popular
with
mates
high

and
not
that
greatly
masked
but
liked

mild

seems
a

a

to
sum
it
up
this
is
all

here
some
hops
to
touch
it
up
but
basically
its
all
malt
here
baby
mouthfeel
not
as
big
as
i
once
thought
when
i
first
started
tasting
different
types
of
beer
this
was
huge
to
us
very
complex
not
its
a
very
drinkable
mass
produced
authentic
german
dopplebock
with
a
lighter
body
for
a
dbock
but
its
nice
overall
mild
carbonation
drinkability
a
solid
brew
but
i
would
go
for
a
celebrator
before
this
one
as
much
as
hopheads
would
embrace
a
fine
ipa
maltlovers
should
welcome
a
doppelbock
such
as
salvator
this
is
one
for
those
cold
nights
where
you
want
a
nice
warming
brew
to
sit
back
and
relax
with
drinkability
a
very
very
good
dopplebock
you
cant
go
wrong
edit
used
this
to
marinate
a
steak
with
cracked
black
peppercorns
garlic
and
olive
oil
turned
out
fantastic
some
beers
get
worse
as
you
drink
them
and
some
get
better
this
one
just
keeps
getting
better
and
better
i
might
be
able
to
drink
it
as
a
session
beer
if
it
doesnt
get
too
sweet
after
a
few
intimidating
pour
bright
opaque
amber

a
thick

noted

medium

very
tasty

stands
on
its
own
as
a
world
class
doppelbock
simply
incredible
a
nice
dark
brown
color
a
very
fine
choice
i
can
see
why
this
beer
has
such
a
good
reputation
the
bottle
was
brown
with
an
old
school
label
what
looks
like
a
date
is
smudged
poured
a
mohagany
red
the
best
smelling
beer
ive
ever
had
the
chance
to
test
some
sweet
notes
in
the
brew
that
i
could
not
recognize
maybe
raisin
fine
brew
enjoy
this
is
an
example
of
the
brewers
art
a
great
beer
that
i
will
sample
again
a
very
beautiful
looking
beer
only
it
seems
to
be
a
little
light
in
color
for
a
dopple
bock
it
is
a
rust
brown
color
with
a
huge
white
head
has
a
sharp
flavor
with
lots
of
carbonation
a
tinge
of
alcohol
and
a
smooth
slick
finish
this
is
a
very
good
beer
not
quite
like
the
other
dopplebocks
i
have
had
but
full
of
flavor
and
something
that
needs
to
be
tried
by
all
translucent
copper
colored
with
decent
beige
head
that
thins
out
rather
quickly
caramelly
sweet
malt
aromas
with
yeast
notes
consistent
with
a
bock
beer
not
a
lot
of
hops
noticable
chewy
crystally
malt
flavor
backed
with
a
significant
alcohol
punch
smooth
malt
profile
very
drinkable
but
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
one
of
the
finer
doppelbocks
ive
tried
the
malt
is
definitely
the
best
part
of
this
beer
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
this
all
the
time
but
it
would
be
fun
to
return
to
and
see
what
else
i
get
from
it
i
had
never
heard
of
this
one
when
i
bought
it
last
week
needless
to
say
what
a
very
pleasant
surprise
definitely
a
world
class
doppelbock
that
i
would
rate
just
a
notch
below
my
beloved
celebrator
paulaner
is
probably
my
favorite
munich
brewer
and
with
consistent
home
runs
like
salvator
they
will
probably
remain
so
pours
to
a
generous
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
with
patchy
foam
and
lace
nice
orangeamber
color
aroma
is
smoky
malt
flavor
is
smoky
malt
alcohol
and
sweet
munich
malt
finishes
sweet
and
with
lingering
bitterness
and
alcohol
warmth
very
balanced
and
drinkable
delicious
stuff
uncomplicated
pouring
it
up
i
noticed
a
warm
brown
almost
amberish
color
maybe
with
a
touch
of
chestnut
in
appearance
the
aroma
reminded
me
of
sweet
things
like
honey
or
apricot
it
left
a
pretty
average
head
but
the
bubble
action
was
fun
the
first
taste
was
surprising
a
little
more
tangymetallic
than
i
remembered
from
the
tap
but
it
wasnt
bad
if
there
could
be
a
cross
between
something
like
pineapple
and
caramel
i
think
you
could
find
it
here
the
sweetness
sort
of
pervaded
perhaps
just
a
little
too
much
i
think
this
one
should
be
enjoyed
with
certain
meals
maybe
involving
sausage
or
steak
definately
steak
i
dont
know
if
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
its
a
nice
changeofpace
type
of
beer
when
its
available
bright
shiny
delicious
with
alcohol
content
eventually
rearing
its
powerful
head
flavor
feels
burnished
roasted
still
fruity
and
let
us
never
forget
delicious
a
world
class
beer
a

surprisingly
approachable
appearance
bright
red
copper
color
with
light
effervescence
a
full
fluffy
beige
head
with
limited
retention
and
a
sticky
lace
the
taste
is
very
astringent
with
a
sweet
middle
malt
caramel
and
a
lingering
bite
aroma
malt
spices
caramel
and
aroma
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
some
effervescence
and
a
lingering
bite
imho
too
abrupt
with
the
astringent
bitterness
not
well
balanced
with
other
sweeter
characteristics
this
pours
a
soft
clear
light
amber
colour
the
lazy
carbonation
reluctantly
rises
to
make
a
pencil
thin
mustache
of
a
head
a
very
pungent
nose
of
prunes
and
caramel
with
just
a
whiff
of
alcohol
the
silky
sweet
malts
fill
your
mouth
and
leave
just
a
taste
of
leather
a
very
filling
and
rich
bock
cant
go

this

achtung
this
is
a
potent
brew
but
remarkably
quaffable
if
your
thirsty
pours
deep
amber
hue
with
intense
malt
aromatics
definitely
all
about
the
malt
but
yet
somehow
in
the
middle
of
tasting
this
beer
i
find
a
balance
between
the
malt
and
hop
salvator
exhibits
remarkable
complexity
for
a
lager
beer
with
bits
of
sweet
candy
and
fruity
flavors
bits
of
toffee
and
fig
and
a
subtle
nuttiness
or
maybe
im
just
nutty
this
is
a
great
dopplebock
and
probably
the
easiest
drinking
one
danger
ive
sampled
i
picked
this
up
because
i
know
it
is
a
classic
and
it
did
not
disappoint
i
have
been
enjoying
it
as
a
nightcap
sharing
a
16
9
with
the
missus
who
likens
its
potency
to
a
cognac
the
malt
is
smooth
sweet
without
being
cloying
the
hop
dryness
enables
a
lengthy
finish
for
a
beer
of
this
type
but
it
is
satiating
and
luxurious
i
am
looking
forward
to
finding
a
bottle
of
ayinger
for
comparison
but
this
beer
has
earned
a
permanent
place
in

inventory

execllent

for
me
i
am
sure
there
is
more
to
this
bock
than
my
limited
experience
with
the
style
can
figure
out
the
head
is

the

some

some

and
it
dries
if
it
werent
such
a
dorky
word
id
call
this
beer
sublime
lets
say
complex
had
to
step
back
a
bit
in
evaluating
this
offering
the
head
and
appearance
with
lacing
were
very
good
im
dont
usually
try
to
sample
these
stronger
brews
so
here
goes
smell
had
a
definite
alcohol
scent
but
it
was
offset
but
a
fruity
aroma
flavor
was
sweet
with
a
strong
alcohol
accent
reminded
me
of
an
after
dinner
cordial
mouthfeel
was
very
full
and
robust
dont
guzzle
a
definite
sipping
brew
for
the
alcohol
content
very
drinkable
if
you
sip
not
the
kind
of
beer
to
drink
all
night
but
i
certainly
would
have
one
before
bed
to
help
me
sleep
poured
a
dark
amberish
colorsurprisingly
slight
fruit
aroma
first
mouthful
indicated
chocolate
carmel
and
some
fruit
but
none
of
them
were
very
bold
doesnt
seem
as
complex
as
described
a
nice
sweet
taste
stayed
with
you
its
nice
just
wish
it
were
a
little
heavier
the
taste
was
pure
candy
from
go
with
candied
malt
accents
esters
fruit
and
sweet
and
spicy
hops
medium
body
and
the
carbonation
is
fairly
high
and
dancing
on
the
tongue
and
all
over
the
mouth
the
drinkability
is
not
very
high
for
me
as
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
to
sweet
but
a
great
and
extremely
complex
beer
paulaner
has
definitely
produced
a
good
dopplebock
not
overly
sweet
it
manages
to
just
hit
the
right
balance
this
is
certainly
one
id
have
again
a
tasty
looking
reddishbrown
brew
with
a
cream
colored
head
atop
it
pretty
good
head
retention
for
a
doppelbock
it
does
stay
for
a
while
but
it
goes
away
for
the
most
part
eventually
lots
of
caramel
sweetness
in
the
nose
and
an
almost
candi
sugarlike
sweetness
as
well
grainy
undertones
are
also
noticeable
on
the
palate
its
big
caramel
malt
up
front
very
smooth
as
it
reaches
the
middle
it
gets
a
bit
more
intense
and
a
cereal
grain
character
is
added
to
the
mix
more
caramel
intensity
at
the
back
with
just
a
hint
of
hop
leaves
this
continues
into
the
finish
which
is
suprisingly
almost
dry
rich
and
malty
throughout
as
a
doppelbock
should
be
excellent
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
cant
wait
to
have
another
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
traditional
lager
but
with
the
presence
of
some
crystal
malts
the
taste
is
good
the
beer
is
light
in
mouthfeel
and
is
carbonated
well
there
seems
to
be
a
hint
of
molasses
here
also
some
dark
lovibond
crstal
malts
the
beer
drinks
well
and
is
my
favorite
so
far
from
the
paulaner
brewers
a
very
fine
doppel
that
looked
smelled
and
tasted
good
the
large
egshell
head
left
slowly
and
created
good
lacing
there
was
a
very
nice
dark
red
amber
body
that
is
really
quite
lovely
the
aroma
is
bready
and
malty
and
the
taste
fills
in
much
the
same
way
ie
with
nice
breadiness
a
very
smooth
and
creamy
body
hel
to
make
this
a
nuicely
drinkable
beer
thick
off
white
head
dissipated
slowly
leaving
a
little
belgian
lace
the
color
is
a
deep
red
with
a
little
orange
tint
to
it
aroma
is
very
complex
with
carmelly
malts
and
a
hop
balance
with
a
definte
alcohol
scent
flavor
is
sweetish
with
carmel
notes
and

and
refreshing
which
seems
to
hide
the
strength
of
the
alcohol
very
drinkable
especially
if
you
are
going
up
against
the
catholic
church
over
religious
dogma
or
just
thirsty
for
a
fine
complex
doppelbock
shiny
copper
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
rests
about
a
half
inch
of
beige
foam
on
top
of
the
liquid
as
it
slowly
settles
it
leaves
a
sheet
of
lace
all
around
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
and
fruity
smacks
of
alcohol
sweet
malt
fig
and
cotton
candy
taste
is
sweet
malt
bits
of
raisin
pear
and
light
molasses
an
alcohol
vapor
rolls
around
the
mouth
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
smooth
for
the
abv
but
you
do
know
its
there
matlybreaddy
feel
at
first
but
creamy
like
a
cream
pie
the
fruitness
reminded
me
of
pie
mmmmmmmmmmm
pie
smelled
like
a
bouquet
little
bit
of
hops
slight
dryness
to
it
but
notig
really
noticable
nice
bit
of
fizz
through
and
through
the
alchohol
taste
balances
the
sweet
taste
with
the
hops
thrown
in
very
nicely
go
get
yourself
5
enjoy
ng
ruby
red
in
color
with
a
head
that
is
small
but
lasted
until
near
the
final
sip
very
nice
appearance
taste
had
a
biscuity
base
to
it
some
alcohol
kick
was
noticed
at
the
beginning
but
faded
towards
the
end
light
caramel
malts
and
other
sweetened
malt
flavors
were
there
a
hop
kick
showed
in
the
aftertaste
but
wasnt
really
there
in
the
body
quite
interesting
poured
a
reddish
brown
amber
color
big
offwhite
head
that
disappeared
after
about
three
minutes
leaving
a
foamy
ring
moderate
lacing
smell
was
of
toasted
malt
with
fruit
and
floral
notes
very
creamy
mouthfeel
taste
was
of
toasted
malt
fruit
a
hint
of
caramel
and
a
minor
zap
from
the
hops
to
wind
things
up
just
enough
to
keep
the
malt
from
being
overpowering
the
fruity
aspect
reminds
me
a
little
of
fruitcake
except
its
good
a
very
satisfying
beer
but
a
little
filling
so
i
dont
think
id
like
to
drink
lots
of
them
at
a
sitting
notes
one
of
my
top
two
or
three
favorite
doppels
to
date
highly
recommended
but
id
like
to
revisit
it
during
the
colder
months
excellent
though
even
in
july
this
is
a
doppel
that
i
truly
enjoy
drinking
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
me
it
has
a
superb
taste
and
goes
down
very
smooth
and
easy
this
beer
poured
a
medium
head
with
medium
sized
bubbles
the
nose
was
malty
and
the
body
was
clear
and
this
beer
had
a
brown
hue
this
brew
pours
a
very
nice
malty
caramel
aroma
from
a
transparent
light
brown
body
with
a
medium
head
of
fine
to
medium
sized
bubbles
it
has
a
slightly
fizzy
initial
mouth
feel
followed
by
a
very
nice
smoky
slightly
burnt
chewy
full
bodied
spicy
flavor
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brews
of
all
time
next
to
andechs
it
was
my
favorite
doppelbock
while
i
was
overseas
in
germany
its
high
alcohol
content
can
be
felts
even
after
just
a
few
sips
it
goes
down
very
easy
i
love
it
500
ml
bottle
poured
a
dark
copper
with
a
biege
head
that
quickly
receded
no
sign
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
malty
and
sweet
taste
is
again
malty
and
to
me
overly
sweet
the
alcohol
come
through
as
well
i
was
unable
to
really
enjoy
this
because
of
the
overpowering
sweetness
not
the
best
dopple
bock
ive
had
i
had
this
on
draught
in
germany
a
few
years
ago
and
enjoyed
it
very
much
this
sample
was
a
12oz
bottle
that
poured
crystal
clear
brown
with
a
thick
tight
head
that
dissapeared
in
a
couple
minutes
leaving
only
a
few
tiny
dollops
of
white
foam
only
slight
lacing
as
well
aroma
is
super
sweet
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
flavor
is
also
very
sweet
and
nothing
but
malt
it
improves
as
it
warms
and
flavor
loses
a
little
sweetness
not
nearly
as
impressive
as
when
i
had
it
on
draught
but
a
fine
doppelbock
none
the
less
and
probably
the
best
german
doppel
out
there
pours
a
very
clear
brown
with
a
thick
foamy
head
the
head
diminishes
very
quickly
and
leaves
a
very
nice
looking
beer
behind
the
smell
is
rich
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
butter
tastes
sweetalmost
caramel
like
and
malty
the
finish
is
dry
and
very
pleasant
very
smooth
with
a
medium
to
full
bodied
feel
very
drinkable
but
quite
filling
a
very
good
beer
for
relaxing
with
on
a
cool
spring
evening
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
decent
bock
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
although
id
really
be
interested
to
try
it
in
germany
rather
than
imported
to
the
u
s
i
suspect
this
bottle
might
have
been
near
the
end
of
its
life
and
if
fresh
could
be
a
lot
better
i
will
say
no
more
but
let
my
perfect
5
be
a
clear
statement
that
although
this
beer
could
be
changed
it
could
never
be
improved
overall
impression
this
is
a
supremely
wellcrafted
beer
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
the
style
robust
nourishing
and
complex
mighty
powerful
too
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
doppel
bocks
out
thereoured
a
nice
deep
copper
color
with
nice
slight
offwhite
creamy
headsmell
is
very
appetizing
of
alcohol
and
sweet
caramel
and
slight
burnt
notes
taste
is
sweetish
of
toffee
and
alcoholand
slight
fruitiness
to
me
this
is
one
of
the
standards
of
doppel
bocks
out
there
this
was
quite
a
nice
beer
it
is
a
nice
copper
color
similar
looking
to
a
glass
of
whiskey
you
can
smell
the
alcohol
when
you
open
the
bottle
and
you
can
definately
taste
it
as
well
there
are
also
some
traces
of
caramel
and
maybe
some
other
flavors
hidden
in
there
as
well
a
very
nice
beer
give
it
a
go
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
and
a
bit
hard
for
me
to
rate
as
i
consider
myself
still
somewhat
of
a
novice
beer
geek
the
appearance
is
copper
in
color
i
expected
it
to
be
darker
being
a
double
bock
it
poured
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
lasted
about
3
or
4
minutes
aroma
is
malty
with
fruit
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
its
taste
is
a
bit
like
a
barley
wine
sweet
fruity
and
alcohol
but
nicely
balanced
with
the
malt
and
hops
that
is
to
say
not
overly
fruity
which
really
turns
me
off
it
is
not
overly
carbonated
it
left
a
nice
malty
caramel
aftertase
this
beer
is
very
drinkabe
although
not
everyday
this
one
to
sit
back
relax
and
enjoy
slowly
definately
not
a
bar
type
of
beer
very
enjoyable
pours
a
thin
head
but
has
great
lacing
looks
surprisingly
light
smells
a
little
sweet
the
aroma
is
decent
but
nothing
really
special
here
it
doesnt
taste
as
sweet
as
it
smells
its
a
very
tasty
brew
very
good
aftertaste
and
incredibly
drinkable
the
overall
feel
of
the
beer
is
something
like
an
oak
barrel
poured
a
gorgeous
oranged
amber
color
with
a
bubbly
offwhite
head
good
slow
lace
and
a
little
staining
on
the
glass
nose
was
of
caramel
beauiful
roasted
wheat
and
a
nutty
malt
that
also
gave
off
a
corn
scent
taste
was
a
hearty
malt
roasted
only
enough
clear
and
clean
but
with
a
creamy
tone
and
one
ounce
of
sweetness
then
came
an
opposing
burnt
sensation
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
fairly
oily
not
the
greatest
tasting
finish
became
creamier
with
time
quite
mellow
for
a
double
bock
poured
a
nice
deep
copper
color
with
a
small
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
but
a
bit
of
lace
remained
the
smell
was
very
sweet
malty
with
just
a
hint
of
caramel
roasted
malt
and
perhaps
some
smoke
the
taste
was
very
malty
and
there
was
a
stronger
alcohol
flavor
than
i
expected
the
carbonation
level
was
not
great
it
sort
of
felt
like
an
alcoholic
syrup
covering
the
inside
of
my
mouth
all
in
all
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
but
i
wasnt
that
impressed
this
was
however
my
first
venture
into
a
true
doppelbock
perhaps
my
review
was
slightly
skewed
because
of
my
inexperience
ill
try
some
more
doppelbocks
and
then
try
this
again
to
reevaluate
pours
a
darkreddish
brown
decent
head
that
lasts
a
while
the
first
sip
reveals
that
this
beer
is
all
about
the
malt
as
should
be
expected
rich
chewy
full
bodied
mouthfeel
a
touch
of
european
hops
at
the
end
to
balance
things
out
at
the
end
certainly
not
a
session
brew
but
a
fullbodied
complex
treat
to
sip
on
clear
light
ambercopper
color
with
a
nice
foamy
lasting
white
head
sweet
fruity
and
flowery
aroma
sweet
and
malty
roasty
caramel
flavors
very
sweet
in
the
finish
medium
body
with
a
sticky
mouthfeel
alcohol
well
hidden
above
average
dopplebock
worth
a
try
always
a
good
choice
a
true
classic
although
i
would
give
celebrator
a
slight
edge
in
flavor
salvator
is
as
good
a
winter
warmer
as
any
has
a
smooth
almost
honeylike
texture
hints
of
carmel
in
the
flavor
reminds
me
a
lot
of
thier
octoberfest
just
a
little
fuller
pours
a
deep
amber
hue
decent
sized
head
some
retention
i
believe
that
salvator
is
another
world
classic
that
has
been
overshadowed
by
more
recent
over
the
top
beers
i
have
never
been
disappointed
by
this
beer
rereview
1003
just
doesnt
seem
as
good
weaker
thinner
i
dont
know
but
not
as
good
as
i
remember
taste
is
super
subtle
of
toffee
roasted
malt
sweet
and
is
kinda
creamysilky
smooth
a
little
bit
chewy
with
a
lingering
dryness
that
settles
in
and
goes
into
the
finish
which
gets
lighter
the
finish
again
reminded
me
of
that
dry
mouth
feeling
you
get
from
eating
dry
popcorn
i
really
liked
the
feel
of
this
beer
its
so
complex
and
layered
the
taste
is
well
rounded
and
has
great
subtle
complexities
as
well
absolutely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
highly
recommended
as
far
as
dopplebocks
go
i
was
getting
toasted
nutscarameltoffeebrown
sugarapple
cider
among
other
things
a
strong
beer
that
you
want
to
drink
and
savor
as
you
go
it
is
full
bodied
and
heavy
tastingbuttery
yet
very
drinkable
hop
presence
and
bitterness
is
low
with
the
accent
definitely
on
the
malts
this
beer
pushes
close
to
tasting
like
a
barleywine
a
special
beer
and
a
treat
for
any
enthusiast
pours
a
deep
amberbrown
color
with
a
huge
creamy
head
that
fades
down
slowly
leaving
a
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
the
aromas
slightly
smoky
with
sweet
caramel
and
malt
undertones
the
taste
was
mildly
sweet
and
malty
with
just
a
hint
of
spiciness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptionally
smooth
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
im
looking
forward
to
my
next
one
the
original
dopplebock
brewed
as
liquid
bread
by
the
monks
for
their
fasts
in
order
to
become
a
classic
beer
really
ought
to
taste
this
good
deep
reddish
copper
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
and
no
lacing
the
smell
of
malt
and
cinnamonraisin
toast
very
pleasing
smell
overall
the
raisin
came
through
in
the
taste
but
the
cinnamon
did
not
rather
it
was
replaced
by
a
deeper
flavor
of
brown
sugar
or
molasses
the
taste
was
malty
but
with
some
slight
hop
tones
maybe
i
was
just
searching
for
them
there
was
no
indication
of
abv
for
my
tastes
the
beer
was
smooth
with
less
carbonation
than
average
but
was
overall
very
drinkable
i
think
this
is
a
better
representative
of
its
style
than
its
rank
indicates
a
nice
dopplebock
with
malty
highlight
ive
had
this
one
many
times
and
everytime
it
seems
a
bit
different
very
sweet
for
a
dopplebock
but
also
very
alcoholic
overtones
and
tastes
it
is
highly
drinkable
but
dangerous
so
remember
to
sip
this
beer
as
it
does
sneak
up
on
you
pours
a
clear
copper
in
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
aroma
consists
of
malt
biscuit
and
sweet
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
mediumbodied
but
seems
inline
with
a
lagered
doppelbock
delicious
sweet
malt
and
caramel
flavors
dominate
the
palette
alcohol
comes
through
lightly
in
the
finish
an
excellent
easydrinking
and
flavorful
doppelbock
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
enjoys
the
style
would
love
to
seek
this
one
out
on
draft
fairly
light
for
a
doppel
pours
an
amber
body
with
almost
white
head
sweet
and
malty
its
a
bit
less
flavorful
than
some
other
doppels
very
drinkable
and
it
wont
kill
your
wallet
like
drinking
celebrator
all
night
will
a
solid
3
doppel
in
my
book
only
celebrator
and
optimator
are
better
for
over
all
drinking
pleasure
pours
out
a
clear
dark
amber
colour
a
thin
head
fades
quickly
leaving
little
lace
very
strong
aromas
of
sweet
toasted
munich
malts
tastes
of
sweet
malts
brown
sugar
sweet
burnt
fruitcake
spicy
hops
and
alcohol
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
beefy
malt
goodness
here
sweeter
than
celebrator
more
complex
than
optimator
its
so
balanced
its
scary
in
its
drinkability
an
exceptional
dopplebock
i
was
first
impressed
by
its
beautiful
appearance
a
coppery
reddish
translucent
fliud
poured
softly
into
my
0
5l
glass
with
about
an
inch
of
slightly
tan
thick
foam
however
as
i
drew
it
nearer
to
my
mouth
the
strong
malty
and
soury
smell
became
more
perceptible
and
less
attractive
for
my
first
impression
i
took
a
sip
nonetheless
a
sweet
malty
taste
combined
with
a
perceptible
alcoholization
and
a
considerable
bitterness
a
good
taste
but
not
the
best
mouthfeel
i
wouldnt
drink
three
in
a
row
pours
a
very
rich
coppery
color
with
a
creamy
white
lace
very
aromatic
with
overpowering
alcohol
and
caramel
taste
is
very
malty
with
obvious
alcohol
and
some
caramel
and
smoke
this
is
a
crazy
crazy
brew
oh
so
complex
and
intoxicating
but
oh
so
good
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
this
is
a
very
drinkable
double
bock
one
would
need
to
be
careful
of
how
much
is
consumed
because
i
am
sure
this
will
get
you
tipsy
very
quickly
but
overall
i
loved
this
beer
this
is
my
first
beer
of
this
style
and
damn
am
i
impressed
copper
in
color
with
a
small
tan
head
this
beer
smells
amazingly
of
caramel
toffee
sweetness
and
maybe
even
a
hint
of
smoke
this
is
such
a
tasty
brew
caramel
and
toffee
come
through
strongly
as
well
as
malt
and
then
a
dry
finish
no
bitterness
whatsoever
and
no
hint
of
the
7
5
abv
making
it
temptingly
dangerous
i
dont
feel
as
if
i
could
drink
many
of
these
in
a
row
though
it
was
very
thick
in
my
stomach
for
some
reason
which
is
odd
since
i
have
been
known
to
down
many
stouts
in
a
row
sometimes
but
regardless
i
very
quickly
just
became
a
fan
of
this
style
this
rich
reddish
copper
beer
pours
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
recedes
to
a
fine
layer
of
foam
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
caramel
sweet
and
satisfying
caramel
nice
roasted
malt
character
and
just
a
bit
of
floral
hops
in
the
nose
the
first
sip
reveals
strong
malt
sweetness
with
caramel
brown
sugar
and
molasses
flavors
abounding
a
bit
of
bitterness
cleans
the
palate
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
mild
carbonation
drinakbility
is
very
good
as
well
especially
for
maltlovers
i
feel
like
i
didnt
say
enough
about
this
beer
its
pretty
complex
and
top
notch
in
every
respect
but
it
defies
description
for
me
tonight
this
is
the
original
dopplebock
and
i
imagine
it
would
be
tough
to
beat
hundreds
of
years
since
its
creation
this
is
still
a
worldclass
bier
pours
a
clear
amber
in
color
with
an
off
white
head
aroma
shows
the
big
malt
body
that
lies
within
taste
of
toasted
caramel
malt
malt
flavor
dominates
as
expected
not
as
sweet
as
some
dopplebocks
hops
chime
in
at
the
finish
to
prevent
too
much
lingering
sweetness
on
the
finish
decent
mouthfeel
but
seems
a
little
thin
for
a
dopplebock
imo
good
drinkability
this
is
not
a
style
im
really
into
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
cheers
pretty
beer
yes
you
are
nose
of
a
cigar
box
stuffed
with
chocolate
and
cherries
appropriately
balanced
sweet
malts
and
steely
hops
finish
with
an
herbal
whisper
mouthfeel
is
frizzy
and
unkempt
but
a
damn
fine
brew
nonetheless
red
amber
color
nice
head
caramel
and
fruit
aroma
taste
is
sweet
caramel
and
raisons
raison
taste
isnt
too
strong
but
i
dont
like
it
in
a
beer
it
goes
down
pretty
smooth
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
was
a
very
good
beer
and
imo
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
no
strong
alcohol
taste
even
with
the
strong
abv
a
true
classic
and
the
worlds
first
doppelbock
if
you
want
to
learn
about
them
and
how
they
should
taste
you
should
start
here
and
then
move
on
to
others
a
consistently
fantastic
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
colour
topped
by
a
nice
thick
brown
head
that
settles
down
rather
easily
aroma
is
dominated
by
malt
flavour
is
malty
and
good
carbonation
tastes
a
bit
sweeter
than
what
i
expected
very
good
german
brew
this
is
my
first
dopplebock
to
try
and
i
must
say
i
was
very
impressed
the
smell
was
a
nice
not
too
strong
sweet
malty
flavor
the
head
could
have
been
a
little
better
it
was
gone
after
the
3rd
or
4th
sip
flavor
was
a
bitter
sweet
caramel
malty
taste
overall
a
good
easy
to
drink
creamy
beer
ill
be
drinking
more
of
this
one
i
must
try
this
on
draft
i
feel
to
truly
appreciate
it
i
think
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
reddish
hue
off
white
head
that
starts
off
decent
and
settles
into
a
half
inch
sheet
leaving
some
lace
toasty
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
alcohol
fruit
and
carmel
medium
body
with
a
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
rich
flavor
of
toasted
malt
and
light
caramel
and
the
alcohol
does
not
hide
finishes
with
some
hop
flavor
and
a
smokey
aftertaste
a
nice
beer
on
a
cold
night
as
it
warms
you
up
salvator
double
bock
pours
to
a
beautiful
mahogany
color
with
a
think
offwhite
head
the
nose
is
toasty
biscuity
and
malty
the
taste
is
wonderful
with
toffee
notes
and
malty
sweetness
it
has
an
alcoholic
warmth
and
a
dry
finish
overall
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
double
bock
with
a
superb
toasted
maltiness
and
nice
alcoholic
warmth
flavor
is
nutty
figgish
with
an
alcohol
spiciness
very
sweet
full
bodied
with
a
pleasant
creminess
slightlty
sweet
finish
is
held
in
check
by
a
mixture
of
peppery
alcohol
and
slight
hop
bitterness
very
pleasant
evening
nightcap
a
wonderfull
beer
with
excellent
malt
character
thanks
to
elguapo
and
the
infamous
daniel
miller
for
the
free
sixer
never
get
left
alone
with
any
large
quantity
of
this
fluid
as
it
surely
will
be
your
down
bring
delicious
malty
aroma
with
hint
of
alcohol
pours
beautifully
and
goes
down
the
chute
smooth
and
rich
you
can
find
the
alcohol
but
it
is
not
overpowering
an
absolute
winner
thanks
to
one
of
my
buddies
for
special
ordering
it
from
the
store
i
just
enjoyed
my
last
celebrator
last
night
and
i
sat
down
with
one
of
these
before
i
started
my
homework
it
struck
me
as
a
very
similiar
taste
as
celebrator
as
i
guess
the
type
would
make
it
so
but
was
significantly
weaker
thats
not
to
say
that
is
a
detriment
in
the
beer
i
look
at
it
as
enabling
me
to
drink
more
of
these
than
i
could
celebrator
and
though
i
enjoy
the
taste
of
celebrator
more
the
lighterness
of
this
brew
in
comparison
helps
its
drinkability
now
as
for
the
beer
it
has
a
very
unique
red
tint
to
its
dark
amber
color
the
head
is
light
and
cabornation
is
even
lighter
the
taste
is
a
rich
toasted
malt
with
a
trace
of
an
alcohol
aftertaste
leaves
a
slight
lace
around
the
ale
glass
i
am
drinking
out
of
i
like
this
brew
and
i
think
i
might
have
thought
more
of
it
had
it
not
been
for
the
two
six
packs
of
celebrators
i
have
been
enjoying
all
weekend
i
will
definetly
give
it
a
retry
in
the
future
this
may
be
the
beer
that
launched
the
dopplebock
genre
but
i
personally
think
celebrator
blows
this
away
not
overly
complex
but
it
does
pack
a
punch
like
any
doppelbock
should
great
amber
color
with
apartment
wallcolored
head
decent
smooth
finish
despite
the
alcohol
flavor
malt
and
caramel
undertones
not
too
bad
clear
deep
amber
with
a
reddish
cast
and
an
offwhite
head
that
holds
fairly
well
but
eventually
drops
to
a
minimal
collar
and
leaves
limited
lace
it
offers
a
bright
clean
toasted
malt
aroma
with
a
soft
background
spiciness
thats
probably
more
from
alcohol
than
hops
the
body
is
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
level
and
a
smoothly
creamy
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
of
a
rich
toasted
malt
with
a
light
caramel
side
and
some
obvious
alcohol
theres
little
hop
flavor
but
its
balanced
bitterness
leaves
a
dry
finish
not
really
complex
but
very
rich
and
enjoyable
salvator
double
bock
deep
brown
color
very
clear
with
a
coffee
and
cream
head
cocoa
aroma
with
a
hint
of
booze
biscuit
malt
flavor
with
but
a
hint
of
hops
rye
bread
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
warmth
on
the
way
down
thick
strong
brew
ill
buy
it
again
when
the
temperature
drops
pours
a
nice
dark
copper
with
an
eroding
white
head
good
malty
taste
easy
drinking
it
will
sneak
up
behind
you
and
knock
you
out
so
treat
it
with
the
respect
it
deserves
wow
superb
has
to
be
my
favorite
brew
from
paulaner
pours
a
very
clear
caramel
color
almost
like
a
dark
tea
the
2
finger
head
is
a
light
tan
and
dissipates
fairly
quickly
but
still
leaves
a
lace
down
the
glass
the
taste
is
a
slight
caramel
with
a
slight
earthy
tone
and
well
balanced
hops
this
a
light
to
medium
bodied
brew
that
is
very
very
drinkable
prosit
i
could
not
find
anything
special
about
this
beer
just
an
average
brew
nothing
outstanding
or
special
ive
tried
this
beer
two
times
and
have
the
same
feelings
as
the
first
time
i
tasted
it
average
a
damn
great
beer
this
ones
a
nice
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
that
dimishes
but
sticks
around
to
the
end
the
smell
is
malty
sweetness
with
just
a
bit
of
hop
kick
it
starts
out
very
nicely
but
just
gets
better
as
it
warms
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
become
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
sits
in
the
glass
for
a
while
it
has
neither
the
aroma
nor
taste
of
a
7
5
abv
beer
its
smooth
and
very
drinkable
i
also
found
the
ale
reference
on
the
label
to
be
surprising
however
ale
or
lager
this
is
a
topnotch
beer
thick
offwhite
head
malty
spicy
aroma
sometimes
with
a
sense
of
ripe
fruit
heavy
sweetness
and
noticeable
alcohol
extreme
malt
presence
for
years
ive
personally
enjoyed
salvator
more
than
celebrator
this
is
a
consistently
great
doppelbock
first
i
was
surprised
like
many
at
the
lighter
color
of
this
doppelbock
its
a
nice
dark
red
amber
color
with
a
copper
head
to
it
not
to
heavy
of
a
aroma
to
it
lighter
slightly
tangy
taste
to
it
nice
flavor
celebrator
is
by
far
the
better
but
this
is
still
a
keeper
what
a
wonderful
treat
it
is
to
have
a
benchmark
original
for
your
favorite
type
of
beer
very
nice
copper
caramel
color
with
soft
creamy
tan
head
the
smell
was
unbelivably
sweet
and
smooth
i
tasted
alot
of
carmel
spicy
sweetness
maybe
brown
sugar
and
cinnamon
to
start
nice
bitterness
on
the
finish
was
a
little
sticky
and
syrupy
on
the
tongue
but
pleasant
not
as
delicious
as
the
celebrator
dopplebock
but
easier
to
drink
more
than
one
and
very
very
good
a
new
favorite
cool
label
as
well
a
beer
deserving
of
its
name
freshness
date
was
403
an
evening
of
doppelbocks
for
me
last
night
clear
orange
amber
consistent
12
inch
head
sweet
smell
slightly
cinammon
bread
thick
malty
flavor
bold
front
to
back
verging
on
heavy
bodied
falls
spot
on
as
far
as
style
in
the
smell
stickiness
and
flavor
departments
falls
into
the
somewhat
ordinary
as
far
as
complex
flavor
or
impression
on
the
mind
malty
as
allgetout
but
hard
to
classify
the
taste
other
than
sweet
and
dense
maybe
slightly
brown
sugar
respectably
brewed
this
beer
is
copper
looks
more
like
an
alt
than
a
dopplebock
to
me
although
i
guess
deep
amber
qualifies
for
a
dopplebock
some
nice
malt
on
the
nose
and
a
little
bit
of
the
fruity
esters
too
pretty
good
taste
but
not
great
i
just
had
the
celebrator
and
this
is
not
in
that
class
maybe
one
notch
below
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
pretty
full
bodied
and
definite
malt
tones
on
the
buds
i
detect
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
in
this
doppel
but
not
a
lot
pretty
easy
drinking
good
doppel
i
think
this
is
an
old
bottle
label
says
10
02
im
assuming
this
is
oct
of
last
yr
didnt
read
the
label
before
i
left
the
store
i
wanted
to
get
my
last
doppelbock
kicks
in
before
spring
hit
full
swing
cant
vouch
for
its
storage
but
seems
in
reasonably
good
shape
still
pretty
sturdy
if
not
ideal
head
disappeared
quickly
and
the
more
robust
malty
characteristics
are
blurred
any
hops
are
totally
obscured
however
the
flavor
has
mellowed
in
an
interesting
and
pleasant
way
a
little
more
liqueurlike
sweet
on
the
palate
but
a
hint
of
matured
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
evocative
of
apples
not
as
filling
as
doppelbocks
tend
to
be
ill
hopefully
review
this
again
when
i
get
a
primo
fresh
bottle
it
just
gets
better
as
it
sits
i
have
not
had
a
better
dopplebock
as
i
have
said
it
really
bolsters
itself
up
as
it
warms
seems
somewhat
thin
when
cold
but
silky
malty
bliss
otherwise
deep
orange
hue
almost
the
color
of
a
nicely
aged
scotch
bubbly
tan
head
that
stays
for
a
while
then
fades
away
to
let
you
really
take
in
the
beautiful
hue
caramel
aroma
faint
dark
fruitiness
almost
like
a
barley
wine
in
complexity
tastes
of
toffee
and
hard
candy
like
the
kind
my
grandmother
used
to
have
around
the
house
during
the
holidays
followed
by
a
peppery
alcohol
finish
man
oh
man
this
is
the
savior
oooh
love
it
amberdark
copper
color
but
with
minimal

mild
sweet
malty

mmm
mediumfull
body
and
medium
mouthfeel
love
the
taste

a
touch
nutty
smooth

again
mmmm
can

this
any

of
the
dayany
day
of
the

week
of
the
year
you
get
the
picture
dark
red
hue
crystal
clear
like
a
well
lagered
beer
should
be
thin
but
persistent
head
with
fairly
low
carbonation
very
visually
appealing
toasty
biscuity
melanoidin
malt
aroma
you
can
smell
the
decoction
domestic
microbrewed
doppels
always
lack
this
huge
malt
sweetness
dominates
initially
and
is
then
followed
by
toffee
and
caramel
flavors
very
smooth
with
a
medium
body
it
definitely
doesnt
seem
too
rich
and
thick
incredible
balance
very
low
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
theres
no
shortage
of
malt
flavors
in
this
brew
alcohol
warmth
very
noticeable
in
the
finish
yum
i
only
want
a
bit
more
body
in
this
beer
but
thats
just
me
this
is
a
tremendously
flavorful
doppelbock
i
have
yet
to
have
a
microbrewed
version
as
good
as
the
widely
available
ayinger
spaten
or
this
one
boy
do
i
love
doppels
i
have
a
hard
time
picking
a
favorite
between
the
big
hitters
this
is
another
dandy
copperbronze
in
color
soft
lace
throughout
tremendous
aroma
fruity
with
dark
red
cherries
coming
through
on
the
nose
very
malty
and
sweet
on
the
buds
but
at
least
to
me
not
too
sweet
just
a
hint
of
alchohol
on
the
finish
very
smooth
and
a
very
complex
taste
tough
to
identify
everything
i
am
tasting
but
at
different
spots
i
taste
the
dark
red
cherries
bread
a
hint
of
caramel
a
hint
of
maybe
bourbon
very
complex
but
wonderful
as
i
grow
as
a
taster
i
hope
to
better
characterize
what
i
am
tasting
in
beers
like
this
but
for
now
this
will
have
to
suffice
there
is
a
lot
more
here
in
this
taste
than
i
can
put
to
words
though
interesting
doughy
flavour
kind
of
tasted
like
i
was
drinking
bread
in
liquid
form
but
it
ended
up
being
a
little
to
sticky
and
sweet
in
the
end
sehr
fein
brauend
beifall
very
fine
brewing
cheers
this
is
one
complex
brew
its
very
tasty
but
hiding
behind
caramel
and
fruit
notes
is
the
slight
kick
of
hallertau
hops
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
try
mmmm
hallertau
dark
brown
appearance
complex
malty
aroma
very
rich
malty
flavor
with
chocolate
and
carmel
overtones
this
brew
is
like
a
meal
but
like
the
other
reviews
stated
it
is
very
drinkable
and
smooth
much
lighter
in
color
and
taste
than
most
dopplebocks
to
me
more
like
a
marzen
in
terms
of
its
malty
caramel
character
i
found
the
kegged
version
of
this
delicious
a
pleasant
change
up
from
the
sometimes
overwhelming
number
of
pale
ales
dark
and
toasty
semisweet
chocolate
an
alcohol
nip
and
just
enough
hop
to
complete
the
experience
a
richly
flavorful
and
well
balanced
example
of
an
american
doppelbock
this
is
a
style
of
beer
that
id
like
to
see
more
of
in
this
country
penn
pretty
much
nailed
it
thanks
again
ozzylizard
outstanding
surprised
me
better
that
i
expected
from
penn
overall
i
rated
this
high
because
it
is
better
imo
than
any
other
christmas
beer
i
had
this
year
it
slightly
beats
out
ayinger
and
is
heads
and
tails
above
spaten
the
other
usual
suspects
2013
release
malts
have
come
more
forward
with
cellaring
whoa
baby
my
first
beer
from
these
guys
if
i
remember
right
is
enormously
delicious
a
christmas
beer
without
spice
i
love
it
this
is
a
classic
dopplebock
type
lager
cold
fermented
patient
and
clean
as
they
get
in
the
finish
for
a
beer
that
begins
this
sweet
dark
brown
with
a
grayish
black
tint
in
color
heady
and
alive
foamy
and
frothy
almost
soapy
looking
head
it
doesnt
fade
either
the
nose
is
german
dark
malts
lager
yeast
and
a
strong
booze
element
almost
like
an
ice
beer
in
a
good
way
though
not
a
cheap
way
the
flavor
shows
the
grain
just
unfolding
in
cool
layers
dried
fruit
raisin
molasses
dried
apricot
bakers
chocolate
tobacco
figs
pudding
skin
and
dusty
german
ritualistic
stale
grain
its
fun
and
different
and
its
the
only
beer
that
screams
at
me
christmas
without
actually
containing
pine
needles
honey
sugar
plums
whatever
they
are
or
anything
else
one
of
the
best
bocks
going
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
thanks
to
my
buddy
chris
for
sharing
this
one
from
his
impressive
cellar
lucky
i
am
to
be
your
friend
mate
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
bock
which
i
found
in
my
cellar
yesterday
and
chilled
overnight
i
find
most
of
penn
brewerys
stuff
to
be
mediocre
at
best
but
this
old
bock
is
unexpectedly
good
good
aroma
tempting
appearance
smooth
palate
and
pleasing
flavor
o
interesting
i
find
most
doppelbocks
to
be
quite
sweet
but
this
one
is
surprisingly
dry
almost
too
dry
it
gives
it
a
crisp
easy
drinkability
for
the
abv
but
its
a
little
too
much
at
times
otherwise
has
nice
malty
and
yeasty
flavors
i
enjoyed
it
a
little
different
than
your
typical
doppelbock
o
i
particularly
enjoyed
the
flavor
and
taste
of
this
brew
its
up
against
of
recent
heavy
hitters
as
noted
above
but
it
stands
up
well
and
is
worth
revisiting
glad
to
have
received
this
as
a
holiday
gift
picked
up
this
2013
version
bomber
at
the
estimable
krugels
georgetown
deli
in
wilkesbarre
pours
beautifully
into
the
goblet
fluffy
head
packed
it
in
early
but
ring
and
lacing
look
nice
extremely
deep
brown
almost
black
slight
spice
or
something
to
the
nose
otherwise
aroma
somewhat
muted
not
the
chewiest
db
ive
had
but
decent
heft
alcohol
is
pretty
muted
very
drinkable
very
good
flavor
nice
beer
overall
o
a
worldclass
beer
i
cant
believe
this
was
only
5
50
a
bomber
if
you
can
get
this
beer
get
it
i
am
going
to
buy
a
case
of
it
so
i
can
cellar
it
for
a
year
or
more
fantastic
i
was
pleased
with
this
pittsburgh
born
doppelbock
it
wasnt
overly
roasted
or
sweet
it
took
the
middle
ground
between
the
two
would
i
drink
it
again
i
probably
would
i
dont
think
i
would
sit
on
this
beer
for
very
long
overall
solid
beer
and
one
i
wish
i
had
waited
to
crack
open
in
the
colder
months
but
just
couldnt
stare
at
it
in
the
fridge
any
longer
this
would
be
the
perfect
beer
on
a
cold
octobernovember
night
by
the
campfire
i
recently
had
a
randalled
version
with
rye
whiskeysoaked
oak
chips
2012
vintage
that
i
thought
was
excellent
i
know
this
beer
rather
well
private
reserve
always
treats
me
right
and
it
was
fun
pulling
this
from
the
cellar
and
seeing
what
was
up
flavors
mellow
slightly
and
the
body
falters
a
bit
but
the
complexity
is
quite
a
feat
recommended
for
all
you
german
beer
lovers
out
there
taste
is
heartily
malty
sweet
to
start
dark
fruits
in
the
middle
maybe
a
touch
of
fusel
closing
with
a
light
bitterness
and
alcohol
warmth
mouthfeel
is
slickery
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
nice
rep
of
the
style
and
an
enjoyable
brew
was
worried
about
excessive
spicing
in
a
holiday
brew
but
this
ones
safe
a
pretty
tasty
beer
a
bit
cloying
but
good
and
manageable
would
have
it
again
around
the
holidays
but
a
bit
rich
to
drink
a
lot
of
overall
excellent
balanced
well
and
super
easy
to
drink
nothing
over
the
top
straight
up
soild
and
add
to
the
face
you
can
score
this
for
between
46
a
22ozer
makes
it
a
value
also
worth
a
drink
every
holiday
season
o
im
in
love
i
think
i
cracked
this
it
the
right
time
maybe
could
have
gone
longer
but
im
quite
satisfied
with
having
imbibed
it
when
i
did
all
this
in
mind
you
had
better
beat
me
to
the
penn
brewpub
this
winter
because
i
intend
to
get
as
much
of
this
coming
years
vintage
as
my
wallet
will
allow
for
o
this
beer
probably
has
a
better
value
than
90
on
the
market
at
4
a
bottle
you
would
be
a
fool
to
not
buy
it
wonderful
balance
very
nice
presentation
should
age
well
cannot
go
wrong
here
sorry
redliner8
thanks
for
sharing
it
tho
pours
a
dark
brown
pretty
much
opaque
aromas
of
dark
fruits
brown
sugar
and
molasses
in
the
taste
sugary
malts
caramel
fig
raisin
and
dates
make
for
a
tasty
beverage
roasted
malts
are
in
the
background
the
presence
of
alcohol
is
on
the
small
side
with
just
a
little
warmth
there
is
a
hint
of
spice
malty
semi
sweet
and
having
little
to
no
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
overall
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
a
nice
malty
bock
that
hides
its
strength
and
is
easy
to
drink
i
believe
it
is
bottle
conditioned
and
would
like
to
try
it
in
that
format
next
2
5
d
im
pissed
that
the
new
operations
managed
to
ruin
this
beer
as
well
it
used
to
be
a
favorite
of
mine
batch

shared
by

pours
a
beautiful
garnet
hue
with
no
head
just
a
thin
bubbly
band
around
the
edges
nose
expresses
dark
fruit
reminiscent
of
fruitcake
and
a
bready
character
taste
reveals
wet
cardboard
subdued
dark
fruit
some
toffee
notes
and
a
suggestion
of
noble
hops
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
an
even
crisp
carbonation
and
a
semidry
finish
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
decent
brew
however
perhaps
a
little
past
its
prime
this
is
such
a
good
offering
from
penn
brewery
they
did
absolutely
stunning
things
with
the
bock
style
this
quite
possibly
is
the
best
american
offering
of
the
bock
style
please
pour
me
more
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
back
marked
batch
001
in
2008
the
selling
it
had
been
trying
to
get
rid
of
these
for
a
little
while
at
that
time
i
really
wasnt
into
buying
bombers
i
just
wanted
12oz
bottles
and
one
day
i
caved
and
bought
this
one
i
saved
it
for
a
little
while
and
then
opened
it
with
some
friends
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
dark
brown
color
the
head
was
a
light
tan
color
the
retention
and
lacing
were
minimal
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
malty
it
had
just
a
little
bit
of
spice
to
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
lots
of
malts
in
there
to
sweeten
up
the
brew
some
grains
and
a
touch
of
booze
heat
in
there
as
well
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
was
pretty
good
i
cant
really
say
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
it
overall
the
beer
was
drinkable
ive
never
had
the
urge
to
find
this
brew
again
since
i
had
it
o
its
on
the
nose
for
a
bock
or
so
the
germans
would
have
you
believe
and
a
solid
enough
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
with
great
garnet
highlights
and
a
smallish
creamy
off
white
head
that
recedes
much
to
quickly
smells
of
malt
yeah
i
know
right
a
bock
thats
malty
go
figure
sweet
toffee
and
caramelized
sugars
mixed
with
some
sweet
plums
and
hints
of
cocoa
taste
is
sweet
with
dark
fruits
melanoidin
cocoa
and
toffee
the
taste
is
wonderful
in
its
malty
sweetness
without
being
cloying
no
hop
presence
detected
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
level
of
carbonation
sweet
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
i
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
this
while
watching
the
steelers
get
it
handed
to
them
in
the
superbowl
very
nice
bock
poured
from
750ml
bottle
into
dimpled
mug
pours
a
brown
mahogany
body
with
a
small
beige
head
that
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
aroma
of
malty
toffee
herbal
hops
and
hints
of
cocoa
and
pears
medium
body
and
carbonation
taste
is
rich
maltiness
with
an
emphasis
on
toffee
herbal
hops
impart
a
sturdy
bitterness
vague
fruity
hints
are
less
assertive
than
in
the
aroma
a
pretty
good
american
bock
but
i
was
hoping
for
better
d
keeper
this
one
is
i
wait
all
year
for
this
and
never
disapoints
this
year
snagged
a
few
extras
and
gave
them
out
as
well
appriciated
gifts
2010
d
drinkability
is
moderately
high
alcohol
is
definitely
there
but
not
as
hot
as
the
abv
would
suggest
great
flavors
that
combine
well
and
it
wasnt
hard
to
finish
the
whole
bomber
d
a
nice
sipping
beer
for
a
cold
winters
day
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
for
me
one
of
my
favorite
bocks
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
the
epitome
of
a
bock
if
you
like
that
give
it
a
shot
beer
is
medium
bodied
leads
off
with
a
nice
sweetness
and
a
strong
malt
character
the
finish
is
really
nice
bocks
are
sexy
beers
they
arent
huge
in
flavors
and
alcohols
but
they
are
transparent
this
beer
has
a
slight
roast
at
the
back
a
full
palate
experience
and
a
great
finish
i
really
like
it
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
bock
this
is
probably
it
id
have
it
again
and
id
be
interested
in
the
nonbrewers
reserve
version
of
this
hopefully
i
can
get
some
when
its
released
this
month
d
i
think
our
tasting
group
was
somewhat
underwhelmed
by
the
straightforward
nature
of
this
beer
the
main
comment
tossed
around
was
that
it
was
very
bocky
i
dont
drink
bocks
very
often
but
if
i
did
this
would
be
a
very
solid
choice
pours
light
brown
to
amber
in
color
with
a
bit
of
a
white
head
and
some
decent
lacing
pretty
good
retention
nose
brings
some
light
malt
and
some
caramel
bread
nuts
and
light
hops
the
taste
is
caramel
and
some
lightlytoasted
bread
good
feel
and
nice
drinkability
definitely
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
them
thanks
davolebomb
for
throwing
this
in
as
an
extra
notes
bottle
is
from
batch
002
and
it
lists
7
5
as
the
abv
drinks
great
8

is
super
smooth
and
malty
md
mouthfeel
is
about
perfect
creamy
but
not
cloying
this
is
very
drinkable
beer
and
its
been
a
pleasure
to
try
if
i
could
score
bottles
like
this
again
for
6
99
i
would
do
it
recommended
for
local
pittsburgh
flavor
i
have
a
feeling
that
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
it
will
taste
really
good
750

tatse
this
is
pretty
good
got
some
carmel
smooth
roasted
malts
figs
rasins
i
was
totally
not
expecting
this
the
body
was
really
thin
but
the
etoh
is
very
hidden
i
drank
the
whole
bottle
in
one
sitting
by
myself
medium
dark
brown
with
reddish
highlights
tan
head
that
falls
to
a
skim
taste
is
rich
sweet
malt
really
nice
plum
raisin
molasses
the
taste
follows
the
smell
quite
tasty
little
bit
of
licorice
on
the
aftertaste
maybe
a
touch
of
alcohol
too
medium
body
and
nicely
carbonated
fine
structure
and
pretty
smooth
overall
a
tasty
bock
that
i
luckily
have
one
more
of
regardless
the
abv
it
was
very
enjoyable
drinkability
going
down
easy
but
watch
out
for
the
abv
which
is
well
hidden
you
could
throw
down
a
lot
of
these
i
dont
think
anybody
would
hate
this
beer
grandmas
cousins
friends
all
enjoyed
it
only
concern
is
the
alcohol
content
drinkability
is
very
good
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
d
good
all
around
bock
however
it
didnt
blow
me
away
either
with
snow
coming
down
again
the
warmth
of
the
beer
helped
out
these
people
make
a
great
lager
i
could
have
finished
this
myself
but
it
was
much
more
fun
to
share
this
brew
with
friends
drinkability
good
m
d
medium
body
a
little
spicy
warmth
on
the
finish
an
easy
going
drinker
but
certainly
not
a
difficult
one
to
imbibe
in
drinkability
a
great
brew
that
i
imagine
would
have
been
much
greater
about
a
year
ago
its
funny
cause
ive
been
trying
to
crack
this
one
at
tastings
for
about
that
amount
of
time
now
but
for
some
reason
it
just
never
worked
out
alas
as
its
a
great
beer
hopefully
penn
makes
this
one
again
this
year
and
im
able
to
pick
it
up
a
traditional
bock
that
at
8
is
really
actually
quite
drinkable
and
definitely
qualifies
for
the
modifier
reserve
kudos
d
nice
better
than
the
original
st
nikolaus
bock
nice
bock
enjoyable
batch
002
enjoyed
on
122609
and
nothing
from
the
original
review
has
changed
this
beer
poured
a
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
that
are
even
more
pronounced
when
held
to
the
light
head
is
about
1
1
12
finger
of
thick
foamy
off
white
head
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
nose
is
caramel
and
toffee
malts
touch
of
chocolate
mixed
in
here
there
is
also
a
hint
of
fruit
in
the
nose
raisins
is
what
i
mostly
pick
up
taste
is
of
bitter
chocolate
mixed
nicely
with
caramel
and
toffee
malts
some
earthiness
follows
the
malts
mixed
with
the
fruity
raisin
presence
detected
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
body
creamy
feel
that
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
sit
with
on
a
cool
evening
overall
great
d
wow
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
a
while
kind
of
pricey
at
12
a
bottle
but
as
a
once
and
a
while
thing
definitely
worth
it
cheers
smooth
yet
complex
oh
so
drinkable
a
good
amount
of
roasted
malts
and
caramel
a
very
enjoyable
bock
recommended
d
an
excellent
beer
i
could
drink
it
year
round
but
i
love
it
more
knowing
i
can
wait
to
have
it
as
a
celebratory
bock
for
christmas
the
lager
is
very
drinkable
for
an
8
beer
most
of
this
beer
in
the
store
was
priced
at
11
99
but
on
one
shelf
it
was
priced
5
99
and
i
got
the
last
one
i
dont
know
why
it
was
cheaper
maybe
it
was
old
but
it
makes
sense
that
it
would
age
well
for
a
bock
because
the
alcohol
is
higher
than
average
for
the
style
drinkability
is
excellent
until
i
saw
the
listing
on
this
database
i
assumed
it
was
around
5
or
6
alcohol
because
that
is
what
it
drinks
like
very
good
and
has
held
up
very
well
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
again
fresh
would
be
nice
if
i
see
this
one
around
for
a
reasonable
price
i
will
pick
up
a
bottle
to
pop
open
for
next
christmas
drinkabilty
is
ok
not
that
exciting
of
a
brew
but
the
abv
is
well
hidden
although
the
spiciness
certainly
isnt
smooth
i
know
people
like
to
score
things
high
around
here
but
to
me
this
is
just
an
average
dopplebock
aother
solid
beer
from
penn
and
id
like
to
get
my
hands
on
another
one
a
very
good
beer
from
penn
tastes
great
and
super
easy
to
drink
definitely
try
it
if
you
get
a
chance
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
rich
but
also
a
little
on
the
light
side
very
drinkable
and
smooth
this
is
a
very
good
slowsipping
holiday
beer
bocks
were
traditionally
brewed
for
special
occasions
including
religious
festivals
like
christmas
i
personally
would
consider
the
winter
holidays
to
be
a
perfect
time
of
year
to
enjoy
this
style
and
penn
brewing
has
treated
me
with
this
late
christmas
gift
there
is
no
doubt
st
nikolaus
note
the
german
spelling
would
be
especially
proud
of
this
rendition
of
the
traditionally
german
style
i
bet
hed
like
to
have
one
too
after
a
long
nights
work
d
a
delicious
bock
and
a
very
worthy
holiday
offering
i
gotta
thank
relatives
from
pittsburgh
for
sending
me
this
st
nick
fresh
and
satisfying
its
starting
me
off
all
warm
and
sweet
on
a
christmas
eve
hopefully
pennsylvania
brewing
company
will
see
the
wisdom
of
releasing
st
nikolaus
bock
bier
brewers
reserve
each
year
if
not
we
can
at
least
console
ourselves
with
the
standard
version
which
is
every
bit
as
good
i
love
the
bright
red
velvet
bag
that
the
bottle
was
sold
in
it
makes
a
special
holiday
beer
seem
even
more
special
im
not
typically
a
fan
of
the
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
flavors
were
spoton
making
for
a
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
if
you
like
bocks
then
i
suggest
you
seek
this
one
out
recommended
batch
001
this
poured
a
semitranslucent
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
bit
of
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
earthy
caramel
and
sweet
molasses
malt
with
honey
wheat
and
a
bit
of
copper
hops
and
alcohol
it
tasted
like
roasted
chocolate
and
barley
malt
with
copper
hops
and
a
bit
of
sweet
yeast
it
was
very
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
tasty
beer
with
clean
flavor
it
had
great
body
and
it
hid
the
alcohol
well
so
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
its
hard
to
complain
but
considering
the
cost
and
fancy
packaging
i
wish
this
was
a
doppelbock
instead
of
single
it
needs
something
extra
to
make
it
truly
special
maybe
a
couple
years
of
age
will
improve
it
in
the
end
wow
this
was
damn
good
who
would
have
thought
i
would
have
been
drinking
a
andescher
and
this
is
in
the
same
three
day
period
is
just
absurd
there
are
far
too
few
of
these
good
bock
biers
out
there
anymore
and
it
is
a
shame
this
was
one
solid
beer
i
would
love
to
see
in
regular
rotation
crimson
sunset
chestnut
big
head
and
nice
lace
it
diew
quickly
though
minimal
lacing
and
retention
aromas
are
all
big
fat
german
malt
yeasty
fresh
baked
dark
berad
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
americano
a
nice
blend
taste
is
big
malt
and
bread
with
plenty
of
malt
and
yeast
complexity
hops
are
lacking
mouthfeel
is
big
and
warming
finish
is
dry
and
hot
drinkability
is
good
a
lovely
drinking
bock
and
happy
for
me
i
found
it
at
stateline
liquors
pours
dark
not
overly
foamy
malty
yet
not
too
sweet
a
tad
of
sourness
good
moderate
roastiness
and
mdoerate
chocolate
balance
above
average
mouthfeel
great
after
dinner
digestive
spot
on
it
is
becomming
increasingly
difficult
to
find
quality
bockbiers
lighter
than
a
dopplebock
but
not
a
watery
bastardized
american
version
either
a
solid
brown
cola
looking
color
with
mild
carbonation
creamy
head
formation
that
whithered
slowly
leaving
light
traces
of
lacing
behind
aromas
of
caramelized
sugars
and
malt
give
a
meloidin
rich
molassas
scent
with
a
rich
meaty
malty
broathy
note
esters
of
dates
nuts
plumbs
figs
and
grapes
flavors
are
less
sweet
less
estery
more
malty
and
with
more
of
a
toastydry
flavor
that
provides
a
lot
of
bittering
a
well
attenuated
clean
caramel
malt
flavor
remains
simple
pure
and
unmuddled
textures
are
firmly
malty
with
no
residual
sweetness
cloying
or
astringent
a
refreshing
herbal
grassy
hop
taste
and
bittering
complements
the
toasted
grains
and
gives
complexity
to
the
flavors
and
textures
finishes
with
crisp
bitterness
toastiness
and
the
first
signs
of
nutmeg
allspice
and
clove
the
beer
would
be
much
better
without
these
but
hey
it
wouldnt
be
marketable
as
a
christmas
beer
without
them
now
would
it
drank
very
easy
this
one
took
a
little
while
to
open
up
my
suggestion
serve
closer
to
ale
serving
temps
than
lager
a
very
good
bock
as
good
as
most
or
better

you

are
overshadowing
their

which
formed
this

for
that

that
alone
the

will
pay
for
what
they

you

an

crystal
clear

a
small

nice
white

that
leaves
slight
lace
down
the
bottle
aroma
is
slight
malt
and
less
hops
but
with
some
solventlike
characters
flavor
is
rich
malt
and
some
alcohol
with
hints
of
hops
solventlike
slightly
estery
late
in
the
flavor
medium
body
supported
well
by
the

is
slightly
sweet
but
with
touches
of

as
well
i
was
a
big
fan
of
the
regular
st
nick
bock
and
this
one
surpasses
the
latter
only
downside
is
its
a
little
pricey
but
definitely
worth
treating
yourself
if
you
liked
the
original
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan

that
leaves
a
lot
of

on
the
way

with
a
not
a
lot
going
on
with
it
still
nice
though
flavor
is
nice

with
a
good
leafy
edge
and
a
sweet
tone
that
hits
on

back
half
nice
robust
qualities

it
smooth

with
a
slightly
higher
level
of
carbonation
a
very
easy
drinking
bock
with
good
robust
tones
goes
down
very
smooth
and
youve
got
to
love
the
nice
little
bag
the
bottle
comes
in
d
a
very
good
lager
tasty
and
definitely
worth
revisiting
too
strong
to
session
drink
but
who
cares

i
think
this

dark

and
hops
in
the
background
taste
is
even

and
a
real
nice
roasty
finish

very
silky

notch
beer
from

have
another

the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
about
a
half
inch
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
excellent
the
aroma
is
very
malty
it
smells
like
dark
fruit
burnt
wood
oak
and
a
bit
of
spice
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
some
spicy
hops
and
a
small
amount
of
alcohol
noticable
in
the
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
it
has
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nice
rich
feel
to
it
drinkability
is
pretty
good
too
its
very
smooth
and
goes
down
very
easy
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
beer
id
definitely
recommend
it
to
others
to
try
750ml
bottle
that
comes
in
a
red
velvet
bag
that
resembles
santas
sack
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
a
nice
array
of

the
taste
much
like
the
aroma
features
a
nice
big
malt
backbone
dark
fruits
and
spices
dancing
around
on
the
tongue
the
drinkability
is
very
high
for
this
beer
especially
considering
the
high
abv
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
that
is
highly
recommended
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
great
head
and
lacing
it
has
a
fantastic
scent
a
very
rich
and
malty
aroma
same
for
the
taste
a
great
malty
and
thick
beer
flavor
with
great
spice
undertones
the
alcohol
is
just
noticable
and
gives
it
a
great
warming
sensation
without
overpowering
or
covering
up
the
great
taste
goes
down
nice
i
will
definitely
be
having
several
more
of
these

it
while

be
looking
for
a

just
a

too
burned

o
this
is
a
solid
doppelbock
it
is
very
sweet
as
are
most
of
the
style
but
its
still
a
drinker
this
doesnt
mess
around
its
malty
sweet
and
alcoholic
if
you
are

itll
leave

o
this
is
a
nice
and
wellcrafted
doppelbock
a
very
dark
one
either
very
sweet
and
full
or
under
attenuated
almost
the
total
opposite
of
maximator
big
with
lots
of
fruit
pastry
notes
almost
like
a
winter
ale
the
hops
are
missed
but
it
works
as
a
malt
bomb
hiding
the
abv
well
still
a
bit
sickly
sweet
for
me
though
it
dries
out
and
heats
up
as
it
warms
and
opens
this
beer
is
really
off
what
i
think
of
in
a
doppelbock
it
isnt
as
rich
or
sweet
and
it
takes
on
a
lot
of
odd
flavors
im
not
used
to
as
well
it
isnt
bad
but
it
is
far
from
good
very
far
body
is
fine
carbonation
is
strangely
active
given
the
head
situation
for
style
its
maybe
on
the
light
side
of
medium
i
find
the
black
teasweet
dark
fruit
flavor
here
to
be
a
little
overwhelming
and
not
up
my
alley
but
no
one
can
deny
an
interesting
brew
try
it
for
yourself
a
doppelbock
that
was
a
tad
on
the
sweeter
side
but
still
had
that
nice
fall
out
on
the
tongue
of
any
lingering
sweetness
this
is
was
toasty
and
a
bit
sour
the
meatiness
was
a
bit
subdued
to
the
fact
that
it
was
a
bit
fruiter
than
usual
they
as
the
fresh
pop
subsided
the
ding
and
smoke
revealed
it
self
a
tad
i
would
say
that
is
on
par
with
most
other
great
doppels
and
much
easier
to
find
in
europe
overall
a
grat
beer
at
a
great
price
i
snagged
a
pint
for
three
bucks
and
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
solid
dopplebock
or
some
smoke
rich
and
roasty
nothing
special
for
me
too
bitter
and
the
flavors
arent
the
carameltoffee
malt
that
ive
come
to
look
for
in
a
dopplebock
not
offensive
but
definitely
not
a
favorite
this
is
a
nice
chocolatey
doppelbock
perfect
for
the
winter
another
great
example
of
the
style
from
germany
pours
medium
brown
with
a
bit
of
a
garnet
hue
to
it
good
offwhite
head
with
a
touch
of
lacing
around
the
edges
bubbly
cap
on
top
as
it
settles
down
nose
is
really
quite
nice
with
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
along
with
some
toffee
caramel
and
fruit
character
the
flavor
isnt
quite
as
impressive
it
lost
a
bit
of
the
sweetness
from
the
nose
and
also
has
a
noticeable
level
of
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
really
nice
and
i
like
the
overall
level
of
sweetness
in
this
slightly
bitter
drinks
quite
well
glad
drabmuh
was
looking
for
this
and
i
was
able
to
pick
it
up
as
its
quite
good
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
lead
off
is
sweetness
malt
syrup
but
not
in
a
cloying
way
its
good
and
clean
with
a
decent
finish
there
is
some
bitterness
in
the
back
from
the
grains
and
the
finish
is
a
little
dryer
than
i
hoped
but
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
and
id
have
it
again
m
as
doppelbock
you
can
feel
alcohol
in
the
mouth
bitter
and
then
dry
sensation
at
the
end
that
lasts
some
time
the
roasted
flavor
remains
all
the
time
very
nice
notes
best
before

well
made
and
a
solid
example
of
the
style
a
fairly
sweet
beer
that
made
for
a
nice
sipping
beer
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
although
i
wasnt
necessarily
blown
away
rather
just
continually
pleased
worth
trying
as
it
is
a
tasty
beer
and
a
good
doppelbock
not
bad
but
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
it
could
be
worse
but
this
one
just
isnt
for
me
impressions
very
nice
bold
flavors
and
lots
of
them
bit
strong
on
the
alcohol
though
so
be
careful
d
awesome
pair
it
with
rich
food
or
guzzzle
it
out
of
a
paper
bag
like
a
hobo
great
either
way
i
wish
very
much
that
this
were
distributed
widely
i
found
it
in
springfield
mo
several
weeks
ago
and
i
believe
it
was
the
cheapest
imported
doppelbock
on
the
shelf
well
worth
the
2
39
it
would
be
a
staple
at
that
price
bier
gersmackt
gute
d
nice
doppelbock
the
aroma
is
spot
on
but
the
flavor
is
just
a
little
lacking
there
is
a
complex
blend
of
rich
malt
characteristics
in
the
aroma
and
while
some
of
this
complexity
carries
over
into
the
flavor
it
is
not
as
enjoyable
there
is
a
bit
too
much
roasted
grain
taste
and
the
finish
could
be
smoother
than
it
is
there
are
a
few
superior
examples
of
the
style
but
this
is
likely
better
than
most
drinkability
was
very
good
the
abv
was
reasonable
and
the
flavor
excellent
i
would
have
loved
to
have
another
d
hardly
notice
the
abv
it
is
well
hidden
in
this
beer
and
lends
a
great
spiciness
to
it
great
flavors
all
around
and
not
overpowering
in
the
cherry
department
id
love
to
sip
this
all
night
actually
i
stumbled
upon
it
and
i
cant
find
it
other
than
one
little
store
i
was
in
i
have
to
go
back
and
set
it
up
for
my
beer
club
as
this
months
winner
overall
i
could
probably
have
a
few
of
these
so
tread
lightly
id
love
to
try
it
on
tap
very
tasty
and
recommended
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
doppelbock
and
i
can
see
why
its
highly
regarded
the
sheer
intensity
of
its
fruitiness
sets
it
apart
from
its
rivals
and
the
malt
is
the
star
of
the
show
here
if
i
had
ready
access
to
this
gem
it
would
certainly
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
malty
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
taste
is
rather
mild
with
some
maltiness
and
finishing
bitter
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
a
bit
heavy
on
the
stomach
for
continued
drinking
overall
this
is
an
average
brew
drinkability
is
good
for
a
full
flavored
beer
but
one
is
enough
for
me
d
this
beer
is
delicious
there
is
a
great
rich
flavor
of
blended
malt
flavors
and
is
just
sweet
enough
to
give
it
depth
without
being
sugary
overall
a
great
doppelbock
for
sure
drank
away
very
easily
perhaps
the
best
taste
profile
as
of
yet
but
unfortunately
the
weak
nose
held
it
back
a
tad
in
the
ratings
this
is
one
ill
be
picking
up
again
for
sure
recommended
a
great
dessert
beer
an
exciting
possibility
for
a
meal
pairing
and
a
very
good
dopplebock
period
this
is
a
musttry
d
awesome
i
got
to
the
bottom
and
was
looking
for
another
ill

picking
up
more
of
this
my
new
favorite
dopplebock
drinkability
a
fantastic
beer
i
did
not
expect
to
enjoy
this
beer
so
much
i
highly

tuchers
bajuvator
doppelbock
is
damn
good
beer
its
my
first
experience
with
tucher
and
im
impressed
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
is
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
im
absolutely
certain
that
its
better
than
the
score
here
will
reflect
simply
because
the
flavors
a
little
better
than
a
4
0
i
just
dont
think
its
quite
4
5
good
nonetheless
this
is
definitely
a
doppelbock
that
you
should
check
out
damn
good
stuff
d
i
could
drink
many
of
these
in
a
row
if
the
abv
wasnt
so
sneaky
absolutely
phenomenal
d
i
could
have
two
of
these
its
roasted
bitterness
offsets
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
pretty
well
and
leaves
it
a
little
more
drinkable

a
very
tasty
beer
and
i
am
so
happy
to
have
it
in
guatemala
will
be
enjoying
this
fullflavored
brew
for
the
rest
of
my
time
here
and
in
the
future
very
nice
doppel
d
a
good
doppelbock
all
in
all
the
mouthfeel
was
a
big
plus
for
me
the
fact
it
felt
thick
compared
to
the
others
i
had
at
the
tasting
was
a
nice
change
overall
this
is
a
superbly
clean
and
wellstructured
example
of
the
style
the
first
few
sips
sort
of
rocked
me
it
was
strong
robust
and
in
my
face
after
a
few
moments
i
was
adjusted
to
it
and
ready
to
enjoy
it
for
all
of
its
good
character
i
highly
recommend
it
but
not
on
an
empty
stomach
conclusion
i
wanted
to
try
this
sidebyside
with
spatens
offering
which
i
did
tonight
because
lets
face
it
after
reading
novick
all
day
you
need
a
drink
anyway
the
spaten
let
me
down
this
one
on
the
other
hand
was
all
i
expected
great
rich
dopplebock
with
nicely
balanced
fruity
and
sweet
malty
tastesaromas
at
a
great
price
need
i
say
more
drinkability
i
found
this
interpretation
of
the
style
to
be
too
brightly
sweet
and
light
for
my
taste
though
i
can
see
others
preferring
it
to
the
heavier
varieties
i
would
appreciate
some
darker
complexities
and
balancing
out
the
fruity
sweetness
somehow
definitely
not
a
bad
doppelbock
but
theres
better
ones
out
there
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
milder
than
some
like
weltenburger
celebrator
and
korbinian
id
recommend
it
but
not
over
those
three
i
would
reccomend
this
to
any
doppelbock
fan
pours
a
clear
pitch
brown
with
thin
tan
head
smell
sweet
with
caramel
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
notes
as
well
as
an
import
grain
character
the
import
character
seems
to
fade
after
a
couple
minutes
good
taste
also
sweet
prune
raisin
caramel
some
chocolate
and
roasted
flavors
black
cherries
a
yeasty
pumpernickel
warming
alcohol
mouthfeel
smooth
a
little
on
the
light
side
nice
german
doppelbock
but
doesnt
match
up
to
celebrator
in
my
opinion
overall
this
beer
is
decent
but
not
as
gratuitously
malty
as
i
would
like
from
a
doppelbock
drinkability
a
quality
highly
drinkable
doppelbock
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
ators
ive
had
well
high
quality
for
sure
the
best
ever
no
but
is
is
a
malty
treat
the
alcohol
flavor
isnt
really
well
hid
but
overall
the
flavors
are
fantastic
poured
a
dark
copper
body
with
a
twofinger
head
that
died
slowly
and
left
little
lacings
a
sweet
malt
smell
a
mix
of
sugary
stuff
and
caramel
a
very
sweet
taste
in
a
thick
and
heavy
somewhat
syrupy
beer
still
goes
down
smooth
and
creamy
as
i
would
say
there
is
caramel
honey
gum
and
maybe
butterscotch
mixed
in
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
not
so
much
tropical
and
very
minor
hop
presence
to
balance
the
beer
finishes
with
a
dry
crisp
yet
thick
and
smooth
mouthfeel
definitely
a
sipper
great
beer
and
one
of
the
better
dopplebocks
i
have
tried
taste
nice
mellow
sweetness
not
as
sticky
sweet
as
others
that
i
have
had
the
alcohol
seems
to
be
very
well
hidden
here
sweet
roasted
malt
with
flavors
of
cocoa
more
than
anything
else
chocolate
covered
cherries
now
i
will
also
make
a
new
descriptive
characteristic
for
doppelbocks
such
as
this
that
i
havent
used
before
this
style
of
beer
is
tobbaccoey
yes
it
tastes
like
raw
chewing
tobbacco
which
i
find
to
be
a
pleasing
taste
even
though
i
havent
chewed
in
years
of
course
now
i
am
pondering
is
there
such
a
thing
as
a
smoked
doppelbock
and
if
so
does
it
taste
like
an
ash
tray
all
jokes
aside
while
this
surprisingly
isnt
the
best
doppelbock
i
have
tried
ayinger
and
sam
adams
in
my
opinion
make
the
best
ones
this
is
still
a
pretty
damn
good
and
very
drinkable
doppelbock
it
was
also
pretty
reasonably
priced
where
i
found
it
so
i
definately
will
have
some
bias
towards
it
tucher
bajuvator
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
smell
was
very
sweet
hints
of
chocolate
and
the
faint
hint
of
hops
taste
was
of
sweet
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
good
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
but
with
all
doppelbocks
you
have
to
be
careful
with
the
high
abv
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
doppel
very
flavorful
a
beer
i
will
seek
out
again
d
excellent
doppelbock
easy
to
drink
but
the
abv
will
make
you
keep
yourself
in
check
definitely
will
seek
this
one
out
again

with
all

i
love

almondleaving
a
disappointing
amount
of

as
it

to

the

is
sugary
and
sweet
with
some
brown

shining
through

me
why
i
love
good
beer
drinkability
flavors
and
mouthfeel
are
very
midstream
nothing
overly
special
one
is
nice

two
or
more
would
seem

overkill
full

adds

touch
in

is
retained
on
the
pallet
a
very
good
doppelbock
and
worth
seeking
out
big
abv
limits
consumption
but
i
will
definately
buy
this
again
when
i
feel
like
a
big
malty
beer
a
very
nice
doppel
from
tucher
d
i
drank
a
pint
and
didnt
need
more
in
a
sitting
prost
overall
this
was
a
great
doppelbock
and
seemed
to
become
even
better
with
each
sip
one
of
the
best
doppels
that
ive
tried
d
a
fantastic
instantiation
of
the
style
the
nose
put
me
off
a
bit
at
first
but
as
it
warmed
up
really
grew
on
me
note
to
self
keep
the
fridge
stocked
with
this
a
great
doppelbock
by
tucher
enjoyed
it
chilled
in
my
duvel
chalice
poured
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
little
head
smelled
of
candied
fruit
some
caramel
and
a
bit
of
toffee
taste
was
similar
nicely
balanced
with
syrupy
viscosity
and
a
warming
finish
a
hardy
brew
that
i
coud
enjoy
after
any
fine
meal
pours
a
slightly
viscous
dark
chestnut
with
nice
clarity
and
a
relatively
short
head
that
fades
to
a
swirly
cap
richly
malty
aromas
with
toffee
cinammon
caramel
and
even
a
touch
of
mint
a
bit
bready
on
the
end
and
not
hot
at
all
the
taste
is
equally
malty
and
even
a
bit
winey
a
little
thinner
than
one
might
expect
but
very
smooth
the
maltiness
has
notes
of
raisins
chocolate
light
spice
and
a
bit
of
herbalness
nice
drinks
well
but
it
is
rich
although
quite
smooth
also
unlike
the
nose
the
taste
has
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
heat
as
well
still
a
very
nice
doppelbock
into
a
nonic
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
russet
color
with
mahogany
hues
not
much
head
to
start
and
fades
to
just
a
ring
a
little
bit
of
spotty
lacing
but
not
much
the
aroma
gives
a
lot
rich
caramels
and
bready
malts
some
toffee
some
nice
stuff
but
its
much
better
to
drink
a
range
of
delicious
things
going
on
there
are
the
rich
malts
of
caramels
of
toffee
the
fruits
dark
and
juicy
some
sweet
molasses
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
chocolate
the
mouth
is
nicely
carbonated
very
fine
and
even
smooth
clean
good
body
this
is
a
fine
beer
one
i
should
revisit
soon
picked
up
a
halfliter
bottle
at
the
local
liquor
store
smells
of
caramel
and
molasses
pours
to
a
dark
rusty
brown
with
a
tremendous
head
taste
is
very
sweet
and
malty
with
a
slight
flat
bitterness
the
ac
is
very
evident
in
this
beer
and
is
present
throughout
this
is
a
very
thick
beer
almost
good
enough
for
pancakes
or
ice
cream
taste
is
mostly
consistent
throughout
nothing
real
complex
but
very
flavorful
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
a
very
good
beer
for
its
style
carbonation
is
just
right
drinkability
is
high
but
watch
the
ac
dont
drink
too
cold
or
the
true
flavor
isnt
evident
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
bier
that
never
disappoints
great
taste
attractive
look
and
just
a
wonderful
bier
nice
carbonation
in
this
brew
shows
as
the
pour
gets
you
three
fingers
of
foamy
deep
tan
head
bubbles
hiss
as
they
slowley
fade
body
is
an
attractive
blackish
brown
with
hints
of
ruby
when
held
to
light
nose
is
spicey
and
rustic
with
woodsy
malt
and
dark
sweet
notes
maybe
hints
of
banana
bread
a
mellow
malty
sweetness
enters
the
mouth
with
minglings
os
belgium
waffles
toasty
vanilla
and
over
ripe
bananas
warms
the
belly
well
and
tells
of
the
7
2
alchol
without
being
obtrusive
at
all
this
is
not
overly
malty
and
thick
as
some
bocks
are
very
enjoyable
and
nicely
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
but
only
because
the
taste
buds
cry
for
more
the
mouthfeel
suffers
from
the
disappearing
head
leaving
it
a
bit
flat
halfway
through
sadly
this
is
a
pretty
good
doppelbock
but
in
my
estimation
a
good
step
below
sam
adams
spaten
optimator
weisenstephaner
and
even
sprecher
it
certainly
accompanies
spicy
cheese
and
crackers
very
well
and
is
on
the
whole
good
yet
the
wheats
from
tucher
captured
my
palate
more
than
bajuvator
good
not
great
d
a
very
drinkable
brew
indeed
its
darkly
fruity
rummy
a
bit
boozy
sweet
yet
really
tight
and
focused
not
bad
at
all
d
the
alcohol
comes
out
enough
to
serve
as
a
reminder
that
this
is
one
of
the
bigger
brews
its
a
nice
standby
after
a
hearty
meal
while
watching
a
movie
like
many
of
the
style
it
warms
well
so
it
can
be
enjoyed
for
a
while
and
return
for
another
highly
recommended
pours
a
clear
but
very
dark
ruby
with
minimal
head
nose
is
sickly
sweet
with
a
strong
caramelized
sugar
with
extremely
heavy
malt
tones
flavor
is
smooth
and
deep
wood
tones
malt
tones
strong
sugar
present
feel
is
nearing
syrupy
definitely
drinkable
leaves
an
almost
smoked
flavor
on
the
aftertaste
overall
a
tasty
brew
i
was
underwhelmed
at
first
but
this
got
better
the
farther
i
got
into
the
glass
overall
a
very
smooth
yet
strong
doppelbock
a
treat
for
both
the
beginner
and
aficionado
poors
a
dark
brown
with
a
beige
surface
lace
and
ring
the
nose
is
of
rock
candy
sweetness
roasted
malts
slight
molasses
and
some
tart
fruits
the
sweetness
in
the
flavor
is
more
tame
than
the
nose
and
earthy
roasted
grains
with
flashes
of
dry
to
charred
malt
notes
balances
some
of
the
tart
fruit
character
echoed
from
the
aroma
some
tongue
tingling
anise
peppery
notes
late
in
the
swill
and
linger
on
the
palate
for
a
bit
very
nice
rounded
full
mouthfeel
and
an
even
better
creaminess
for
carbonation
level
some
tartness
roasted
grain
and
sweetness
left
for
the
finish
this
was
really
enjoyable
from
beginning
to
end
d
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
night
overall
excellent
first
beer
in
germany
2007
d
a
good
representation
for
the
style
worth
a
try
if
youre
in
a
doppelbocking
mood
hizzah
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
dopples
i
have
tried
seems
a
bit
lighter
than
my
favorite
celebrator
good
change
of
pace
overall
another
excellent
and
nicely
balanced
german
doppelbock
recommended
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
thin
creamy
looking
offwhite
head
smell
is
quite
malty
with
a
harmony
of
roasted
and
caramel
malts
blended
with
a
slight
fruitiness
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
very
malty
with
a
slight
alcohol
bite
that
seems
to
balance
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
and
just
a
touch
of
fruitiness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
the
beer
feels
viscous
in
the
mouth
but
drinks
like
water
possibly
a
very
dangerous
combination
at
7
2
id
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
dopplebock
and
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
d
a
very
good
dopplebock
and
yet
another
good
beer
from
tucher
this
was
a
nice
doppelbock
it
looked
especially
delicious
with
its
darker
and
cloudier
than
normal
dark
red
bronze
body
the
foamy
cap
was
khaki
in
colour
and
stuck
around
for
a
good
45
seconds
before
falling
to
become
a
5mm
thick
blanket
over
the
liquids
surface
yes
this
is
a
beautiful
doppel
to
look
at
i
cant
wait
for
doppel
weather
to
return
smell
is
plenty
of
caramel
and
toasted
cereal
this
guy
is
all
malt
for
certain
taste
sadly
while
very

is

has
a

and
a
much
stronger

while
maintaining
a
drinkability
and
a
level
of
refinement
you
can
expect
from

european

overall
an
excellent
doppelbock
i
would
look
for
this
again
to
drink
strong
but
not
overwhelming
smooth
delicious
and
very
drinkable
complex
and
well
structured
a

not

overall
very
very
delicious
without

a

lots
going

besides
the
roasted

dark

there
is
a

the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the

with
even
a
hint

goes

very
easy
even
with
a
sore

no
bitter

harsh
aftertaste
at

really
liked
this
brew
and
is
the
worlds
2nd

founded
in
1050
a
d
prost
cheers
o
this
is
probably
in
the
upper
echelon
as
far
as
german
imports
ago
a
truly
hearty
beer
still
a
couple
notches
below
celebrator
and
andechs
as
far
as
flavor
expression
and
depth
perhaps
falling

the
way
toward
the
ayinger
from
say
salvator
if
that
makes
sense
regardless
pretty
killer
if
you
dig
the
style
id
grab
a
bottle
if
you
come
across
it
frosted
with
dust
or
not
a
real
neat
tasting
doppelbock
probably
for
me
i
think
i
like
them
a
big
maltier
and
bigger
but
this
is
very
impressive
and
an
excellent
beer
light
to
moderate
chocolate
notes
smooth
lightly
carbonated
slightly
off
aftertaste
though
that
makes
this
so
so
the
alcohol
is
warming
and
not
overpowering
o
an
extremely
well
made
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
beer
very
well
done
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
foamy
beige
color
the
aroma
is
very
bold
with
malts
the
taste
is
sweet
complex
and
malty
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
mixed
in
with
the
hints
of
fruit
and
dried
fruit
very
interesting
taste
and
quite
well
made
this
really
defines
the
style
of
the
massively
malty
german
beer
from
the
500
ml
bottle
purchased
at
bottleworks
in
seattle
a
great
refreshing
doppelbock
lacks
the
heaviness
of
others
and
is
really

by

this
beer
ive
had
it
once
before
and
thought
it
was
good
but
this
is
excellent
a
must
try
very
filling
and
chocolaty
beer
with
a
fair
amount
of

smooth
with
a
good
combination
of
roasted
and

although
some
was
noticeable
the

content
was
well
blended
with
the
beer
came
as
a

addition
in
this
case
o
to
be
honest
a
really
great
beer
for
those
who
enjoy
a
sweeter
bock
this
will
not
be
your
cup
of
tea
for
those
looking
for
a
nice
mix
of
sweet
fruits
and
depth
this
is
definitely
a
beer
youll
want
to
try
definitely
a
redrink
overall
a
great
doppelbock
surprised
i
have
never
heard
of
this
one
before
worth
it
heck
of
a
dark
bock
here
really
is
and
like
most
german
stuff
or
i
should
say
much
german
stuff
the
price
is
outstanding
for
the
quality
my
second
beer
from
this
brewery
and
i
like
it
better
than
the
first
very
dark
color
to
this
looks
brown
but
glows
the
deepest
of
ambers
when
held
to
a
bright
light
the
head
is
magnificent
like
something
sam
smiths
would
do
in
their
yorkshire
squares
and
i
mean
that
as
a
compliment
to
the
germans
lacey
and
rising
and
bubbly
and
thick
and
lasting
and
it
makes
an
outstanding
beer
moustache
like
nearly
perfect
in
my
mug
the
nose
is
quite
sweet
from
the
dark
malts
notes
of
red
earth
and
smoke
too
complex
and
dark
wintery
but
i
smell
lager
yeast
too
making
it
a
little
cleaner
than
a
winter
warmer
type
of
ale
the
flavor
is
of
course
malt
forward
and
there
is
an
astringency
to
it
that
doesnt
come
from
alcohol
grassy
and
hard
to
place
but
almost
smells
like
the
kind
of
fermentation
you
get
when
vegetables
sit
on
the
counter
for
too
long
pleasant
though
in
a
really
organic
sort
of
way
the
finish
is
cleaner
sweet
and
robustly
roasted
a
glorious
combination
i
just
wish
it
had
as
much
body
as
it
does
flavor
carbonated
well
enough
and
very
satisfying
save
for
a
want
of
more
body
its
knit
picking
though
with
such
a
fine
glass
of
beer
as
authentic
as
they
come
and
one
i
will
go
back
to
at
this
price
in
the
4
dollar
neighborhood
a
very
dark
cola
brown
to
blackish
doppelbock
with
a
pungent
sweet
aroma
and
decent
amount
of
brown
head
to
match
dried
dark
fruits
dominate
both
smell
and
taste
raisins
dried
currents
dates
prunes
combined
with
the
bread
in
the
malt
one
gets
a
fig
or
date
newton
effect
also
present
are
treacle
toffee
and
dry
chocolate
flavors
to
add
a
lower
end
to
all
those
fruit
effects
riding
up
top
very
heavy
sweet
finish
with
some
alcohol
to
yield
a
brandy
effect
not
hoppy
or
particularly
bitter
some
doppelbocks
are
less
sweet
and
yield
more
complexity
but
i
am
not
complaining
o
very
well
made
dopplebock
a
sipper
could
have
used
a
touch
more
bitterness
but
hard
to
find
fault
overall
this
was
a
good
find
for
5
bucks
and
is
pretty
tasty
not
sure
why
i
didnt
like
it
as
much
as
the
dunkel
but
its
pretty
world
class
another
decent
doppelbock
on
a
hot
summer
day
call
me
contrarian
i
surely
dont
mind
like
wine
pairings
with
food
im
more
of
the
opinion
that
you
should
drink
and
eat
what
you
like
and
just
hope
that
they
get
along
with
a
few
obvious
caveats
so
it
is
that
im
enjoying
a
drinkable
wellflavoured
strong
bock
while

filters

complex

bready

dark

flavor
is
somewhat
subdued
compared

aroma
but
in
the
moderate
flavor
there
is
a
lot
going
on
nice
creamy
medium
body
probably
the
darkest
malt
doppelbock
ive
encountered
and
although
the
flavor
is
not
intense
it
still
feels
rich
and
satisfying
very
nicely
done
belongs
among
the
top
of
the
german
representations
of
the
style
o
interesting
pretty
good
in
the
porter
direction
one
of
the
better
dark
german
beers
a
very
drinkable
doppelbock
soft
and
cleansing
on
the
end
perhaps
a
bit
bready
but
still
not
all
that
sweet
which
is
fine
by
me
a
nicely
interesting
doppelbock
not
too
malt
heavy
in
that
there
are
an
interesting
array
of
boozy
fruit
and
roasted
notes
it
is
interesting
and
not
too
heavy
it
is
quite
rich
and
maybe
could
improve
by
a
bit
more
balance
all
the
things
going
on
here
comes
across
as
a
bit
boozy
which
is
probably
my
main
issue
but
it
still
drinks
very
nicely
and
is
worth
a
try
overall
drinkability
the
best

lovely
aroma
of

munichy

goodness
and

taste
is
much
the

not
a

which
is
why
i
love
it
and
the
style
so
much
such
a
powerful
bavrian

beer
very
easy
to
drink
pours
a

with
a

that
lasted

aroma

bread

just

ettal
dopplebock
i
had
earlier
in
the
day
a
pretty
satisfying
doppelbock
nice
balance
between
the
malt
hops
and
carbonation
a
delightfully
nice
drinking
doppel
bringing
complexity
mixed
together
with
subtlety
to
produce
a
fine
glass
of
beer
this
was
certainly
an
unheralded
treat
really
enjoyed
it
and
had
no
knowledge
of
the
beer
going
in
recommended
on
the
tele
via
torrent
while
tasting
the
fishermans
apprentice
with
monty
halls
e4
o
lovely
flavours
but
i
cant
help
but
feel
this
couldve
been
a
monster
nearly
a
classic
o
some
great
flavours
here
make
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
soothing
and
pleasant
to
drink
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
overall
a
good
doppelbock
i
would
definitely
have
again
the
grape
juice
aroma
and
hint
of
licorice
in
the
taste
make
this
an
appropriate
holiday
brew
all
in
all
this
is
a
tasty
unique
offering
from
the
second
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
you
can
also
pick
it
up
for
pretty
cheap
in
pittsburgh
ill
probably
continue
to
purchase
more
awesome
bock
when
im
in
the
mood
decent
beer
but
if
you
have
others
to
chose
from
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
this
doppelbock
pours
a
clear
dark
mahogany
brown
with
tall
creamy
light
brown
foam
that
settles
but
clings
a
bit
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
malty
with
notes
of
caramel
molasses
raisins
and
figs
very
nice
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
and
richly
malty
with
flavors
of
chocolate
molasses
grape
skins
roasted
malt
a
hint
of
hops
buried
deep
and
some
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
somewhat
dry
light
sweetness
with
full
body
and
modest
carbonation
feel
a
dry
chocolatey
lightly
bitter
flavor
lingers
pleasantly
overall
a
very
nice
dark
doppebock
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
but
it
ended
up
being
a
little
sweet
and
there
was
this
overpowering
grape
taste
o
overall
some
very
noticeable
chocolate
malt
character
perhaps
with
some
brown
ale
tones
about
a
stronger
then
usual
hop
bitterness
on
the
swallow
solid
decent
drinkability
like
a
cross
between
a
brown
ale
and
a
bock
d
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
good
drinkability
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
o
a
great
doppel
with
some
unique
flavoring
leaving
it
a
step
to
the
side
from
most
dbs
the
malt
is
the
highlight
but
varies
and
gives
a
complexity
nose
is
malty
and
fragrant
just
a
hint
of
cocoa
and
earth
along
with
the
toffee
a
dash
or
roasted
malt
not
an
over
the
top
take
on
the
style
but
a
classic
toffee
toast
earth
cocoa
wood
leather
prunes
a
light
sweet
body
could
perhaps
be
a
little
rounder
that
is
easily
overwhelmed
by
a
strong
dry
finish
drinkable
and
complex
delightful
on
this
fall
evening
just
superb
330

but
also
apricot
toffee
maybe
a
bit
light

and
not
much
carbonation
taste
of
licorice
roasted
dark
fruits
i
think
i
detect
a
hint
of
tobacco
chocolate
and
caramel
too
very
good
o
a
very
tasty
example
of
a
doppelbock
i
cant
really
think
of
anything
id
change
on
this
one
i
can
see
why
this
is
rated
as
one
of
the
best
of
its
style
this
ones
worth
looking
for
especially
if
your
a
fan
of
the
style
big
thanks
to
eskimodave
for
hooking
me
up
nice
dark
and
rich
bock
deep
reddybrown
light
tan
head
malt
toffee
liquorice
allsorts
and
light
wine
in
the
nose
grape
malt
toffee
milk
chocolate
allsorts
fruit
all
come
through
in
the
taste
low
carbonation
slightly
oily
could
be
a
bit
more
carbonated
light
alcohol
and
candies
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
creamy
tasty
bock
poured
out
as
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
a
yellow
white
head
on
top
the
lacing
and
retention
are
pretty
good
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
very
malty
with
a
slightly
sweet
aroma
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
an
earthy
flavor
to
it
with
lots
of
malt
in
there
the
mouthfeel
has
a
good
thickness
to
it
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
very
good
and
worth
trying
rich
dark
chocolate
on
the
palate
ending
with
an
earthy
dryness
the
feel
is
full
but
there
are
some
overcurrents
of
supporting
fizziness
but
this
doesnt
take
away
from
the
rich
elements
here
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
brew
i
just
wish
weather
was
cooler
while
drinking
it
overall
a
very
good
beer
my
favourite
doppelbock
o
a
very
solid
bock
sort
of
low
on
the
abv
scale
to
be
a
doppelbock
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
it
is
definitely
a
solid
doppelbock
overall
a
good
doppelbock
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
great
flavor
worth
picking
this
one
up
an
update
on
101612
having
another
asam
bock
today
and
there
is
none
of
the
clay
character
i
experienced
previously
quite
nice
taste
overall
scores
updated
the
beer
was
smooth
warming
and
rich
in
wintery
chocolate
flavours
very
drinkable
in
deed
medium
bodied
and
fuller
than
expected
with
a
good
balance
of
bitter
roasted
malt
and
sweeter
chocolate
flavor
dry
and
roasted
up
front
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
hazelnut
caramel
and
toffee
theres
also
some
faint
hop
bitterness
that
compliments
the
roasted
character
some
nice
bready
yeast
underneath
adding
to
the
body
and
a
ton
of
chocolate
sweetness
make
this
beer
very
quaffable
abv
well
masked
with
a
slight
dry
finish
pretty
good
so
here
i
am
cleaning
my
keg
and
thinking
to
myself
why
not
drink
a
brew
i
had
just
done
a
run
the
other
day
and
picked
up
some
bocks
i
have
not
had
redish
brown
when
held
in
the
light
on
the
table
more
of
a
dark
brown
very
light
head
from
the
poor
minimal
lacing
and
fingers
around
edges
so
far
looks
fab
i
love
the
smell
of
caramunich
malt
light
hop
aroma
what
is
there
is
pleasant
and
only
subtle
taste
is
magnificent
with
very
malty
taste
with
caramel
sweet
on
the
tongue
and
cheeks
but
not
so
much
so
the
hops
really
bring
out
the
flavor
profile
of
the
grain
medium
to
slight
thickness
in
the
mouth
with
little
carbonation
to
tickle
the
tongue
one
of
the
best
bock
i
have
had
pours
a
dark
chestnut
brown
with
a
good
light
tan
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
nose
brings
forward
a
bit
of
light
caramel
some
mild
nuttiness
and
mild
earthy
hops
great
malt
presence
all
around
the
flavor
ramps
things
up
with
a
bit
of
extra
sugar
sweetness
and
strong
dark
caramel
a
bit
of
an
earthy
presence
in
the
dry
finish
slight
bit
of
dark
fruits
there
as
well
good
medium
body
with
lower
levels
of
carbonation
quite
drinkable
d
an
amazingly
well
done
doppelbock
and
at
3
19
a
bottle
an
affordable
luxury
this
is
probably
only
outdone
by
celibrator
but
it
definitely
comes
close
this
is
surely
a
doppel
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
german
style
doppelbock
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
a
fine
example
of
a
quality
dopplebock
i
will
certainly
be
revisiting
this
gem
though
not
as
interesting
as
others
in
the
style
this
is
still
an
excellent
doppelbock
this
german
beer
is
a
good
beer
with
its
deep
reddishbrown
color
with
a
carmel
smell
on
first
sniff
the
flavor
is
a
malty
taste
with
a
very
light
after
taste
the
foam
is
medium
and
light
i
would
have
this
doppelbock
again
but
as
a
first
and
then
work
my
way
up
the
chain
of
doppelbocks
drinkability
pretty
good
beverage
on
its
own
versus
the
leaders
of
the
pack
for
the
style
maybe
not
so
much
but
it
is
a
decent
brew
worth
trying
the
nice
deep
color
had
me
looking
forward
to
a
full
flavored
german
beer
my
expectations
were
not
realized
as
this
beer
was
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
it
was
comparable
to
an
above
average
store
beer
but
not
up
to
the
potential
that
i
was
wanting
from
a
greatly
reviewed
from
ba
this
obviously
is
a
problem
of
mine
because
the
people
of
ba
know
beer
better
than
i
do
and
i
will
continue
to
yield
to
the
advice
of
my
cohorts
my
quest
for
the
perfect
german
beer
similar
to
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
continues
the
palate
is
just
exceptional
cocoa
and
molasses
are
noticeable
up
front
along
with
burnt
sugar
brown
sugar
and
a
pleasant
toasted
bread
character
the
midpalate
has
a
breadlike
richness
mildly
pumpernickellike
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
blend
of
brown
sugar
and
toast
this
is
wonderful
the
mouthfeel
is
just
spectacular
perfect
carbonation
is
present
this
is
soft
and
creamy
on
the
palate
and
coupled
with
the
mediumlight
body
that
has
some
melanoidins
i
could
not
possibly
ask
for
more
from
this
beer
this
beer
really
does
justice
to
the
style
combining
rich
flavors
and
drinkability
that
is
scary
d
very
impressive
a
musttry
this
is
every
bit
as
good
as
celebrator
and
andechser
doppelbock
dunkel
the
only
thing
it
lacks
is
the
hype
toffee
as
you
taste
the
beer
those
aromas
intensity
and
create
a
very
well
rounded
bock
aroma
with
a
sweetness
of
roasted
malts
that
is
kept
in
check
by
the
bittersweetness
of
a
great
hop
it
has
great
carbonation
and
certainly
calls
for
more
very
good
beer
just
like
expected
from
an
old
brewery
like
weltenburg
the
mouthfeel
is
fitting
lightly
carbonated
and
weighty
thick
and
rich
yet
still
light
enough
to
be
rather
drinkable
on
a
chill
fall
day
oh
yea
will
drink
this
again
d
very
good
dopplebock
but
im
going
to
have
to
give
it
a
couple
notches
down
on
this
one
because
of
the
sweetness
again
guess
im
just
spoiled
by
sours
drinkability
is
decent
pretty
good
beer
overall
but
its
one
id
only
want
to
drink
one
bottle
of
per
sitting
drinkability
quite
drinkable
for
such
a
nicely
flavorful
brew
i
would
gladly
have
this
again
and
again
overall
an
excellent
beer
nicely
balanced
very
complex
easily
drinkable
all
times
of
year
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
how
great
doppelbocks
can
be
drinkability
darn
tasty
but
something
about
the
way
it
lingers
makes
one
bottle
plenty
d
not
good
or
bad
theres
not
questions
its
a
bock
but
it
lacks
a
lot
of
distinctiveness
i
would
drink
this
if
handed
to
me
but
wouldnt
reach
for
it
in
the
store
notes
a
very
nice
a
solid
beer
nothing
particularly
knocked
me
back
but
it
was
an
enjoyable
drink
and
an
easy
beer
to
drink
f
still
pretty
sweet
on
the
finish
would
have
liked
it
to
dry
off
a
bit
but
thats
the
style
really
a
long
caramelized
malt
and
molasses
flavors
with
roasted
porter
flavors
lingering
a
slight
wheat
linger
too
but
not
much
d
this
is
a
great
substitute
for
a
stout
or
a
robust
porter
not
too
heavy
a
great
beer
on
cold
rainy
nights
hv
sweet
full
bodied
slight
syrup
flavor
with
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
at
the
back
end
beer
is
smooth
really
smooth
great
palate
connectivity
there
isnt
much
carbonation
in
the
mouth
but
overall
a
great
and
highly
drinkable
beer
a
wonderful
doppelbock
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
m
a
light
creamy
texture
with
medium
carbonation
medium
body
and
carbonation
but
a
little
watery
on
the
way
down
pretty
drinkable
but
ill
take
a
salvator
over
this
any
day
kloster
lacks
the
depth
and
flavor
differentiation
i
have
encountered
in
most
doppelbocks
taste
is
sweet
caramelised
prunes
brown
bread
dark
toast
with
hint
of
burnt
sugar
and
raisinylicoricespice
character
it
stends
slightly
to
the
sweet
side
from
the
start
but
not
cloyingly
so
like
some
and
it
has
a
drysih
finish
before
a
lightly
sweet
aftertaste
d
very
drinkable
try
one
on
for
size
it
fits
nicely
great
looking
beer
that
is
dark
but
with
a
ruby
red
gleam
not
much
head
when
poured
into
5
liter
spaten
mug
smell
isnt
so
good
it
is
malt
intense
but
does
have
a
sort
of
salt
water
scent
to
it
strong
malt
taste
that
isnt
as
rich
as
i
was
expecting
very
drinkable
caramel
with
a
bit
of
licorice
that
dont
really
fade
so
leave
a
great
aftertaste
surprisingly
drinkable
beer
as
i
dont
feel
it
is
that
heavy
the
asambock
is
a
darkbrown
rich
and
malty
brew
from
the
oldest
monastery
brewery
in
the
world
the
origins
of
this
beer
from
kelheim
germanyaccording
to
the
label
date
from
1050
ad
excellent
head
formation
and
retention
the
brews
initial
impression
left
no
doubt
to
its
strength
as
an
authentic
double
bock
and
no
ordinary
bock
beer
the
first
taste
gave
me
an
impression
of
tawny
malt
and
toffee
perhaps
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
candied
fruits
as
i
finished
the
beer
i
felt
very
satisfied
with
a
pleasant
lingering
sweetness
on
the
tongue
kept
from
me
too
cloying
by
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
and
roasted
malt
very
drinkable
for
the
style
and
very
tasty
on
a
winters
night
all
in
all
this
might
change
my
perspective
on
doppelbocks
great
beer
d
i
only
paid
2
49
for
a
bomber
at
6
9
abv
ill
sure
pick
up
another
one
goes
down
very
easy
smoooth
d
i
wish
this
came
in
a
12oz
bottle
as
a
halfliter
was
a
little
bit
too
much
considering
the
intense
sweetness
im
curious
if
a
fresher
bottle
would
have
a
touch
of
hops
to
offset
the
slightly
overthetop
saccharine
quality
still
its
a
pretty
enjoyable
brew
and
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
ive
had
a
tasty
drinkable
doppelbock
that
would
make
good
drinking
all
year
round
d
this
was
a
surprisingly
awesome
doppelbock
and
never
got
to
be
too
much
drinkability
was
good
the
beer
pours
a
mahogany
brown
color
with
good
head
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
quite
malty
as
one
would
expect
with
baked
apple
cherry
and
lots
of
sweet
malt
flavors
on
the
palate
replicate
the
nose
but
additionally
i
get
some
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
this
is
really
a
rather
tasty
dopplebock
the
beer
surprisingly
finishes
a
bit
on
the
dry
and
spicey
side
despite
the
moderately
sweet
and
malty
mid
palate
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
to
full
with
a
fairly
long
finish
the
6
9
abv
is
pretty
well
disguised
and
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
very
solid
dopplebock
from
weltenburg
addendum
ive
now
had
this
beer
more
than
once
still
agree
with
my
review
here
and
still
feel
it
is
an
excellent
dopplebock
and
well
worth
seeking
out
overall
a
deliciously
malty
beer
and
a
benchmark
example
of
the
style
seems
to
be
the
most
popular
for
its
ability
to
hid
the
abv
quite
well
with
a
taste
that
almost
leans
on
the
side
of
mild
english
porter
pour
is
a
clear
light
brown
and
i
dont
mean
amber
but
a
solid
brown
that
lets
through
quite
a
bit
of
light
nose
of
apples
and
dark
fruit
dark
malt
of
sparse
chocolate
and
mild
dunkle
sour
sour
of
plum
fruit
with
a
sufficient
sweet
mild
grape
and
a
significant
malt
backbone
but
not
too
much
density
mellow
body
drinkable
even
in
summer
some
grape
even
the
most
crossover
into
a
more
english
format
of
beer
for
the
brewery
ive
had
yet
but
extremely
impressive
coming
from
a
lager
poured
a
solid
dark
brown
with
twofinger
head
and
sheath
lacing
down
the
glass
a
good
mix
of
bready
caramel
and
roasted
malts
along
with
some
yeast
heavy
fruits
and
a
dash
of
floral
hops
mediumtofull
bodied
w
a
little
haggardness
from
breadnut
taste
but
mostly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
little
sticky
and
sweet
and
contains
some
fruit
flavors
like
orange
or
something
and
is
complemented
by
a

the

infront

its
well
crafted
and
the
characters
sit
together
very
nicely
very
nice
beer
d
yes
yes
yes
very
drinkable
d
a
very
good
dopplebock
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
if
you
hate
even
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
your
beer
this
isnt
for
you
but
for
a
doppelbock
this
is
very
well
balanced
and
not
overly
sweet
out
of
all
of
the
different
brews
made
by
weltenburger
this
is
one
of
the
few
that
is
actually
brewed
on
sight
at
the
kloster
the
rest
are
brewed
in
regensburg
i
had
this
at
the
brewery
in
kelheim
and
was
pretty
disappointed
perhaps
my
expectations
were
too
high
after
drinking
the
best
dark
beer
in
the
world
as
of
2008
but
even
that
cant
explain
how
off
the
taste
was
it
comes
in
a
normal
lager
glass
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
disapprears
the
color
is
a
dark
brown
with
some
tints
of
red
towards
the
bottom
it
has
an
incredibly
sweet
smell
with
some
hints
of
alcohol
but
the
two
dont
really
go
together
in
the
taste
it
quickly
fades
from
being
sweet
to
sour
drinkability
quite
drinkable
for
a
strong
beer
and
somewhat
refreshing
for
a
dark
bock
this
is
your
beer
overall
exceptional
beer
very
unique
strong
but
smooth
sweet
but
rich
going
to
buy
many
more
in
short
a
very
malty
fruity
doppel
bock
with
sticky
texture
this
is
a
really
good
beer
bought
it
at
the
lcbo
in
ontario
and
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
nice
dark
colour
with
a
2
or
3
finger
head
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
can
almost
smell
the
alcohol
it
first
tastes
of
the
malt
and
then
after
a
faint
bitterness
of
the
hops
comes
through
really
smooth
beer
going
down
it
got
better
as
it
got
closer
to
room
temp
the
foam
was
wheat
in
color
2
fingers
high
frothy
lacey
and
stuck
to
the
glass
smell
was
rich
and
aromatic
with
hints
of
fruit
the
color
was
deep
red
almost
carmel
the
taste
rich
and
aromatic
complex
a
hint
of
carmel
and
hoppy
its
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
deep
drinkability
was
good
pours
a
nice
translucent
cola
brown
under
a
light
brown
twofinger
head
that
fades
slowly
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
so
far
so
good
sweet
candy
caramel
fills
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
hinted
nuts
the
mouth
is
quite
mildlycarbonated
and
rather
sticky
coating
the
mouth
and
staying
there
this
is
indeed
a
very
nice
doppelbock
with
lots
of
sweet
grain
bordering
on
maple
syrup
real
not
imitation
there
is
a
slight
hops
kick
in
the
finish
but
it
is
easily
overlooked
as
this
one
is
all
about
the
malt
very
nice
this
bottle
boasts
of
being
brewed
by
the
oldest
monastery
in
the
world
dating
1050
which
is
just
10
years
younger
than
weihenstephan
i
believe
drinkability
definitely
the
best
doppelbock
that
ive
come
across
so
far
im
assuming
this
is
how
the
style
is
supposed
to
be
done
great
drinkability
with
a
fruity
silky
and
warming
character
a
well
crafted
beer
d
ive
had
nice
luck
with
doppelbocks
this
year
and
this
is
yet
another
of
them
the
complexity
of
flavor
and
chewy
mouthfeel
make
this
a
very
substantial
beer
im
quite
glad
i
picked
it
up
nice
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
this
was
a
good
dopplebock
poured
into
bubble
pint
glass
poured
what
appeared
at
first
to
be
black
but
when
held
up
to
light
showed
to
be
a
very
deep
garnet
a
deep
khaki
tan
head
left
minimal
lacing
a
solid
aroma
featuring
a
slightly
sweet
roasty
presence
the
flavors
the
flavors
feature
that
roasty
sweetness
with
a
slight
hop
tang
on
the
finish
wonderfully
full
body
that
lingers
but
doesnt
stick
among
the
most
drinkable
brews
ive
ever
had
you
can
sip
these
for
a
long
time
centuries
perhaps
a
true
world
classic
it
pours
up
a
transparent
dark
brown
color
with
crimson
edges
small
off
white
head
the
nose
is
traditional
german
malts
with
no
real
depth
some
subtle
chocolate
also
the

i
taste

nice

low
carbo
a
good
brew
german
monks
of
the
late
middle
ages
considered
dopplebocks
to
be
their
liquid
bread
which
would
sustain
them
through
long
periods
of
fast
hence
sometimes
referred
to
as
fastenbier
or
lenten
beer
they
also
believed
that
liquids
cleansed
the
body
and
soul
the
more
you
drank
the
holier
you
were
shoot
isnt
easter
coming
up
well
then
i
better
get
to
it
d
i
love
the
dopplebock
style
of
beer
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
ever
tasted
the
mouthfeel
as
a
whole
is
fairly
soft
and
average
carbonation
is
very
low
drinkability
at
least
for
me
scores
low
the
beer
is
sipper
and
i
enjoy
plenty
of
those
but
this
one
doesnt
have
enough
to
offer
to
make
me
consider
having
another
in
the
end
theres
nothing
really
to
figure
out
its
just
sip
upon
sip
of
dark
fruit
good
doppelbock
that
just
needs
a
small
push
in
the
flavor
department
the
beer
is
a
dark
brownish
red
liquid
when
held
up
to
the
light
with
a
creamy
beige
head
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
very
malty
its
a
big
sweet
bready
beer
with
some
hop
spiciness
its
just
not
complex
or
big
enough
to
really
stand
out
in
the
style
im
not
going
to
say
anything
bad
about
this
beer
but
thats
not
enough
to
push
any
of
the
scores
above
a
4
it
almost
pushes
past
good
in
drinkability
because
its
rather
easy
to
drink
for
a
doppelbock
but
that
category
also
encompasses
my
eagerness
to
buy
another
bottle
and
i
cant
say
that
this
beer
will
ever
make
it
into
regular
rotation
for
me
korbinian
among
a
few
others
is
just
more
interesting
and
fun
to
drink
so
its
a
good
german
doppelbock
and
ill
leave
it
at
that
not
quite
as
complex
as
some
other
doppels
ive
had
but
a
damn
good
one
smooth
easy
drinking
and
very
tasty

i

myself
drinking

the

i
can

this
is
an
insanely
good
doppelbock
ive
had
an
american
version
of
many
german
styles
that
have
pretty
much
nailed
it
but
they
cant
seem
to
get
the

right
if
you
want

this

must

looking

quality

this
a

tasty
beer
but
perhaps
too
filling
the
initial
drinkability
is
great
but
as
you
continue
on
it
becomes
harder
and
harder
good
beer
all
around
d
an
awesome
doppelbock
not
one
im
going
to
down
multiples
of
at
a
time
but
one
id
love
to
have
on
a
regular
basis
i
need
to
taste
this
with
my
one
bottle
of
andechs
held
in
reserve
d
an
incredibly
easy
drinker
perhaps
too
easy
a
very
tasty
beer
and
the
elements
of
it
all
come
together
well
to
form
a
very
satisfying
experience
well
worth
picking
up
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
i
could
find
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
only
that
i
dont
have
another
one
to
follow
it
up
with
its
aroma
and
flavor
are
perfect
opposites
to
that
of
the
ipas
ive
been
drinking
for
way
too
long
this
beer
convinces
me
its
time
for
a
change
to
german
bocks
for
some
really
cool
historical
information
about
this
really
neat
monestery
wikipedia
weltenburg
and
read
up
the
monestery
is
on
a
beach
on
a
bend
in
the
danube
its
crazy
to
see
a
monestery
on
a
beach
like
some
sort
of
all
inclusive
resort
d
goes
down
smooth
and
really
is
tasty
a
winner
for
sure
great
i
will
drink
this
again
but
not
too
much
malt
liquor
whatever
this
is
liquid
bread
this
is
a
bavarian
miracle
i
tried
this
beer
on

2008
after
purchasing
from
one
of
the
local
lcbo
outlets
the
beer
poured
a
very
dark
translucent
when
held
against
the
light
reddish
brown
the
head
was
tancoloured
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
the
aroma
and
the
flavour
were
both
grainy
malt
in
all
its
glory
almost
a
chewy
maltiness

a
definite
warmth

aroma
is
all
malt
and
sweet
the
flavour
follows
similarly
its
all
malt
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
seems
appropriate
for
the
style
though
its
not
really
my
thing
this
is
very
nice
drinkable
although
this
is
a
beer
to
be
savoured
as
it
warms
you
up
from
the
core
glad
i
have
another
few
a
very
nice
doppelbock
tastes
of
sweet
dark
malts
caramel
and
some
fruitiness
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
it
still
warms
my
belly
a
very
good
beer
enjoyable
in
either
the
summer
or
along
a
winter
fire
and
this
one
is
being
enjoyed
on
the
deck
in
a
semispring
day
the
body
of
this
beer
is
a
majestically
dark
ruby
red
topped
with
a
generous
creamy
tan
coloured
head
that
left
sheets
of
lace
a
heavy
malt
aroma
contains
strong
fruit
notes
spices
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
the
flavour
goes
long
on
the
malt
caramel
chocolate
sweet
bread
and
toffee
lead
through
to
a
bready
filling
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
heavy
with
little
in
the
way
of
carbonation
this
seems
to
be
a
great
example
of
the
style
notes
this
beer
reminded
me
why
i
enjoy
doppelbocks
a
kindler
gentler
dbock
with
all
the
wellmade
class
youd
expect
from
a
reputable

this
brew
is
nothing
short
of
delicious
a

lovers
paradise
for
sure
highly
recommended
almost
certainly
better
than
any
doppelbock
ive
ever
had
and
this
is
my
first
beer
from
this
brewer
so
big
so
complex
so
satisfying
i
will
definatley
pick
it
up
again
thanks
to
barbara
and
family
at
tbc
for
making
the
boise
beer
scene
that
much
better
the
brew
is
definitely
better
had
at
a
60ish
temp
to
release
the
character
d
this
is
a
easy
drinking
beer
for
its
size
and
style
not
refreshing
in
any
sense
but
it
really
isnt
meant
to
be
i
imagine
it
is
a
wonderful
complex
as
well
as
intense
big
beer
one
that
demands
your
attention
if
you
want
to
take
everything
this
beer
has
to
offer
a
fantastic
beer
to
be
sure
and
a
wonderful
pick

doppelbocks
nice
though
smooth

taste
is
malty
with

notes

chocolate
notes
the
roastiness
is
a
little
too
present
and
adds
a
sharp
taste
hops
are
invisible
and
only
add
maybe
a
little
earthy
hoppiness
the
yeast
is
clean
and
accentuates
the
maltiness
mouthfeel
is
big
and
leaves
a
sticky
feeling
on

this
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
relax
with
i
just
dont
dig
on
the
label

i
am
going
to
need
to
try
this

i
could
turn
this

and
lots
of
caramel
toffee
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
an
awesome
tasting
brew
put
it
right
up
there
with
a
celebrator
for
sure
wish
it
was
locally
available
was
a
little
skeptical
at
first
looked
like
a
lot
of
german
labels
and
was
afraid
of
the
lagery
mediocrity
smelled
as
such
too
thankfully
i
was
wrong
the
taste
was
quite
unfamiliar
and
hard
to
describe
but
it
was
definitely
toasted
malty
with
some
toffee
and
caramel
very
sweet
the
beer
warrants
a
more
in
depth
descirption
however
my
tongue
has
not
the
talent
to
offer
it
hops
were
hard
to
find
but
it
didnt
matter
a
damn
delicious
brew
the
alcohol
had
minimal
presence
which
is
a
good
thing
in
my
book
only
negative
thing
is
the
sweetness
can
get
a
bit
much
lowering
the
drinkability
but
i
can
definitely
see
myself
going
back
to
this
one
pours
a
clear
dark
chestnut
body
with
a
medium
sized
beige
head
that
is
creamy
and
lasting
sticky
sheet
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aroma
of
bready
malt
toffee
caramel
herbal
and
spicy
hops
body
and
carbonation
are
medium
hop
bitterness
is
more
prominent
in
the
taste
than
expected
with
an
herbal
feel
that
is
a
bit
disconcerting
malt
presence
comes
to
the
rescue
with
assertive
notes
of
toffee
and
raisin
bread
yeast
has
a
slight
twang
an
interesting
doppel
but
not
one
i
would
return
to
this
is
a
top
notch
doppelbock
ill
have
to
do
a
taste
off
with
this
one
and
the
other
top
examples
of
the
style
to
see
how
it
stacks
up
this
beer
was
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
there
was
a
good
head
on
this
beer
the
smell
was
chocolatemalty
with
no
hop
notes
finishing
with
a
faint
coffee
aroma
the
taste
was
chocolate
coffee
biscuit
malty
and
nicotine
the
body
was
very
full
the
nicotine
flavor
was
strong
and
a
put
off
for
me
d
fantastic
beer
everyone
else
at
the
table
had
apple
strudel
i
was
more
than
content
with
this
beer
striking
similarities
with
some
porters
ive
had
recently
but
minus
the
harshness
that
comes
with
that
style
happy
to
have
a
nice
store
like
randalls
here
in
the
st
louis
area
and
will
go
back
to
stock
up
on
a
few
of
these
not
too
familiar
with
this
brewery
but
for
sure
will
try
all
of
the
offerings
a
solid

i
really
liked
this
one
the
first
wb
doppel
i
have
had
this
one
compares
very
well
to
the
benchmark
double
bocks
i
will
definitely
grab
this
one
again
d
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
smooth
flavorful
beer
hope
i
remember
where
i
got
this
one
zum
wohl
i
drank
it
pretty
quick
because
i
could
not
get
enough
of
how
it
tasted
thick
rich
and
out
of
this
world
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
great
beer
md
the
mouthfeel
is
consistently
soothing
and
softlyfizzy
while
the
body
holds
up
extremely
well
this
is
a
fullbodied
yet
wellbalanced
doppelbock
that
drinks
almost
too
well
perhaps
the
best
of
its
kind
ive
luckily
tasted
if
only
the
slightly
sticky
edge
could
be
milder
this
could
be
an
extremely
quaffable
strong
lager
along
with
rostocker
bock
dunkel
i
tasted
two
days
ago
this
style
of
beer
dunkel
bock
and
doppelbock
is
increasingly
hooking
my
palate
lovely
overall
an
outstandingly
rich
and
complex
beer
also
incredibly
drinkable
highly
recommended
mouthfeel
is
smooth
almost
thick
very
chewy
and
just
joy
to
drink
overall
an
excellent
doppelbock
right
up
there
in
my
top
3
attaway
weltenburger
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
aftertaste
remains
slightly
sweet
with
hints
of
the
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
lingering
a
long
time
very
nice
deep

nice

nice

filling
yet
not
heavy
very
very
drinkable
beer
a
real
winner
in
my
book
the
caramel
sweetness
blends
the
whole
thing
right
together
nice
d
tasty
easy
to
drink
a
good
solid
doppelbock
id
look
for
this
again
beer
is
good
happy
big
bold
doppelbock
beering
poured
this
beer
from
bottle
to
a
tumbler
at
48
degrees
the
beer
was
a
nice
rich
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
taste
was
of
roasted
malts
and
toasted
grains
the
beer
had
a
slightly
sweet
taste
and
i
thought
slightly
peaty
alcohole
was
evident
on
the
exhale
and
though
not
overdone
i
was
glad
it
was
no
higher
i
will
purchase
again
drinkability
very
nice
certainly
not
sessionable
but
great
on
as
cold
night
after
dinner
d
a
classic
doppelbock
salvator
is
just
too
sweet
for
me
now
i
would
go
for
the
asam
bock
over
it
still
has
the
sweetness
but
the
roasted
malt
character
balances
it
so
well
a
great
example
overall
a
solid
heavy
beer
liquid
sustanance
not
my
favorite
doppel
too
sweet
and
yeasty
in
the
mouth
however
its
a
joy
to
look
at
and
smell
this
beer
this
is
one
fine
brew
very
glad
i
picked
this
up
will
probably
get
more
than
one
next
time
drinkability
a
different
take
on
a
doppelbock
and
certainly
enjoyable
just
a
bit
too
bready
and
that
twang
thing
keeps
it
from
being
top
notch
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
with
a
great
flavor
profile
not
quite
as
big
as
some
other
doppelbocks
but
i
think
thats
why
i
like
it
its
a
very
approachable
beer
for
something

aroma
is
very
sweet
lots
of
caramel
and

aroma
reminds
me
of
the
taste
of
samiclaus
it
doesnt
taste
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
suggest
the
dry
bitterness
of
dark
malts
cuts
the
sweet
caramel
maltyness
there
are
hints
of
cocoa
along
with
cherries
and
plums
moderately
full
mouthfeel
but
nothing
too
much
its
not
so
thick
you
need
to
wash
it
down
a
tasty
beer
with
a
rich
aroma
a
little
different
the
most
doppelbocks
and
worth
keeping
an
eye
out
for
wow
drinks
too
easy
more
impessed
with
this
the
2nd
time
around
more
what
i
remeber
it
tasting
like
in
dland
as
far
as
dopplebocks
go
this
one
of
the
most
sessionable
with
a
great
drinkabilty
flavor
to
match
wonder
if
the
lcbo
still
has
any
of
this
left
good
example
of
the
doppelbock
style
but
lacking
slightly
in
the
the
serious
punch
required
to
suit
drinkability
very
very
nice
great
example
of
the
style
delicious
and
affordable
definitely
one
of
the
best
dopplebocks
ive
had
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
in
a
medium
bodied
brew
featuring
the
cocoa
caramel
with
a
sweetness
up
front
i
picked
this
beer
up
randomly
in
a
german
supermarket
and
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
when
i
opened
it
tonight
for
dinner
while
the
head
did
not
stick
around
too
long
the
rich
malty
smell
and
taste
only
got
better
as
the
beer
warmed
up
a
little
bit
when
i
first
tasted
it
i
was
struck
by
the
chocolate
and
burnt
flavors
blended
with
a
firm
but
slightly
understated
background
of
hops
as
it
sat
in
my
mouth
the
flavors
mellowed
out
to
a
slightly
sweet
coffeelike
flavor
with
background
notes
of
cherries
even
with
so
much
flavor
packed
into
each
sip
the
lighter
mouthfeel
for
such
a
large
beer
made
it
very
enjoyably
drinkable
altogether
this
is
one
of
the
the
more
impressive
german
beers
that
i
have
had
first
time
i
had
seen
this
in
salem
1pt
9oz
bottle
very
nice
looking
beer
mahogany
with
hints
of
garnet
round
the
edges
lovelly
looking
thick
creamy
tan
head
aroma
is
rather
subdued
with
the
malts
giving
a
breakfast
cereal
like
smell
not
unpleasant
but
unusual
indeed
taste
is
very
malty
and
creamy
hints
of
semidark
chocolate
in
the
after
taste
but
its
mostly
luxuriant
creamy
maltiness
i
like
it
very
nice
on
the
palate
a
very
full
and
pleasing
mouthfeel
not
the
best
doppelbock
i
have
had
but
probably
the
smoothest
and
most
drinkable
in
quantity
within
reason
body
is
just
medium
perhaps
a
wee
bit
too
slight
for
the
flavor
payload
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
chewy
with
a
smooth
and
creamy
texture
very
smooth
with
no
trace
of
alcohol
lends
to
terrific
drinkability
an
affordable
sessionable
dopplebock
this
is
a
great
beer
zum
wohl
mk
once
finished
pouring
the
beer
looked
remarkably
a
bit
like
guinness
without
the
head
very
dark
in
colour
with
a
bit
of
red
shining
through
the
head
was
perhaps
a
fingers
width
which
slowly
disipated
to
a
thin
patch
sweet
smell
without
it
being
overpowering
bitter
dark
chocolate
bready
malts
caramel
toffee
bit
of
coffee
and
raw
hide
i
like
it
taste
is
great
plenty
of
sweetness
but
enough
natural
bitterness
to
not
make
it
nauseating
the
question
is
does
the
bitterness
come
from
the
hops
or
the
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
hmm
something
to
ponder
over
mouthfeel
is
light
smooth
and
creamy
highly
drinkable
could
be
used
as
a
session
brew
if
not
for
the
7
20
d
well
i
have
a
mini
keg
of
this
so
well
find
out
im
not
too
worried
about
it
though
decent
pour
nothing
too
special
head
is
minimal
and
body
a
warm
mohagany
color
leaves
just
the
tiniest
trace
of
lacing
nose
is
caramel
mingled
with
molasses
taste
is
pretty
much
identical
but
in
the
tail
end
i
get
a
splash
of
fruity
hops
alcohol
is
almost
entirely
masked
mouth
breaks
in
thick
waves
over
the
tongue
drinkability
is
ok
but
i
cant
help
but
think
that
theres
something
missing
here
this
is
a
tough
one
for
me
to
review
i
usually
drink
pale
ales
stouts
and
wheat
beers
this
one
tastes
something
like
a
very
sweet
stout
in
fact
its
far
to
molasses
for
me
that
being
said
i
will
acknowledge
that
it
is
well
balanced
and
of
good
quality
it
has
a
deep
burnt
umber
colour
and
tan
head
that
laces
nicely
it
grows
on
me
with
each
sip
there
is
a
nice
chocolate
that
comes
out
as
i
drink
if
you
like
a
good
boch
then
im
guessing
that
this
is
will
do
the
trick
my
rating
is
a
bit
lower
because
i
dont
like
the
sweetness
i
am
dedicated
to
bitter
fragrant
hops
no
complaints
however
it
has
integrity
but
strangely
it
also
has
a
dog
kibble
scent
too
d
very
drinkable
tastes
good
it
seems
to
have
a
bit
of
coffeetasting
stout
flavor
that
i
didnt
detect
with
the
nose
a
definite
malt
bomb
but
by
no
means
sweet
nice
bitter
finish
great
mouthfeel
smooth
and
creamy
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
at
7
i
better
not
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
doppelbocks
but
i
really
like
this
and
i
will
get
it
again
the
beer
in
my
mouth
has
a
medium
body
with
a
carbonation
level
thats
a
bit
too
high
for
the
lighter
thickness
of
the
body
finish
is
dry
and
tight
quite
satisfying
drinkability
is
high
though
a
bit
difficult
to
take
more
than
one
due
to
the
higher
alcohol
content
and
intensity
of
all
the
flavors
still
with
the
amount
of
malt
used
in
doppelbocks
perhaps
thats
to
be
expected
insanely
drinkable
what
a
fantastic
db
only
3
for
a
16
9oz
madness
a
big
thanks
to
spencer
and
the
city
beverage
crew
for
bringing
this
one
in
picked
this
up
from
a
cardboard
box
hidden
in
a
corner
of
the
local
systembolaget
when
i
opened
it
it
did
not
smell
much
except
of
dark
sweet
bread
the
color
was
very
dark
brown
it
poured
with
a
finger
of
creamy
foam
the
taste
was
of
burnt
caramel
very
sweet
but
also
with
a
strong
bitterness
and
some
ginger
i
guess
you
could
say
that
the
overall
taste
was
predominantly
bitter
and
caramelly
a
tight
and
dry
beer
with
medium
carbonation
but
not
in
the
premier
league
of
its
style
d
high
in
alcohol
and
overly
sweet
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
limit
is
probably
1
or
2
per
sitting
handsome
brown
in
color
with
hints
of
burgundy
large

with

a

beer

a

thanks
for

for
bring

notes
almost
like
a

in

nice

sample
if
you
see
it
nicely
drinkable
bock
beer
here
this
is
an
absolutely
perfect
match
for
a
sweet
desert
containing
nuts
like
baklava
or
even
strong
enough
to
stand
up
to
the
flavors
in
fruitcake
pours
a
distinct
reddish
brown
right
on
for
the
doppelbock
style
smells
like
a
german
chocolate
cake
only
muted
enough
to
let
the
roasted
maltiness
shine
thru
the
taste
starts
out
dark
and
malty
but
slides
seamlessly
into
a
toasted
sugary
sweetness
smooth
but
rich
with
enough
original
teutonic
flavor
to
keep
me
interested
for
several
bottles
worth
this
is
an
excellent
dopplebock
without
much
in
the
way
of
faults
its
easy
drinking
enjoyable
true
to
style
and
never
burdensome
high
on
the
list
of
classic
dopplebocks
pours
with
a
minimal
tan
head
this
looks
just
like
coca
cola
in
a
glass
smells
wonderful
yeasty
malty
dark
rich
bread
with
a
note
of
sugar
taste
is
faithful
to
the
nose
with
definite
caramel
yet
though
starting
strong
midway
loses
its
backbone
and
seems
to
collapse
a
bit
leaving
very
little
aftertaste
to
enjoy
taste
doesnt
seem
to
follow
through
good
nevertheless
mouthfeel
is
solid
for
the
style
very
drinkable
for
the
style
less
syrupy
than
typical
doppelbocks
a
strength
or
weakness
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
rich
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
roasted
and
crystal
malts
it
has
a
sweet
caramel
aroma
wit
some
light
toastiness
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
sweet
and
rich
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
slightly
earthy
with
residual
sugars
the
elevated
abv
is
well
hidden
with
the
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
doppelbock
it
has
excellent
aroma
and
a
rich
warming
flavor
this
is
a
good
drinker
anytime
d
for
its
style
its
very
light
i
expected
a
lot
more
body
paid
1
50
for
a
20
oz
bottle
nice
smoky
black
color
shallower
parts
are
a
very
deep
redbrown
smells
amazing
chocolately
and
burnt
sugary
molasses
tastes
equally
awesome
much
more
flavor
than
the
usual
bock
caramel
and
heavy
toasty
malts
this
may
be
the
session
beer
of
all
session
beers
excellent
overall
pretty
drinkable
but
not
too
impressive
appearance
is
a
murky
deep
ebony
that
resembles
worchestershire
sauce
and
the
aroma
is
redolent
of
prunes
raisins
molasses
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
word
sweet
comes
to
mind
wow
this
is
a
great
dessert
beer
very
filling
caramel
and
chocolate
finally
drift
into
hops
in
the
after
taste
leaving
one
with
a
dry
finish
i
might
try
this
again
if
i
had
a
sweet
tooth
attack
as
the
beer
warms
other
aromas
develop
sweet
yams
baking
bread
and
a
funky
barnyard
thing
pretty
nice
pretty
distinctive
wkab
sounds
like
a
radio
station
starts
out
with
a
tad
too
much
static
but
with
warming
the
signal
becomes
much
clearer
and
a
good
bit
louder
as
well
im
not
sure
that
its
classic
radio
but
im
certainly
glad
that
i
tuned
in
a
better
than
good
doppelbock
for
sure
from
a

9
fl
oz
it
poured
a
dark
reddishbrown
with
an
inch
of
foam
with
small
traces
of
lace
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
pleasant
caramel
roasted
chocolate
the
taste
is
sweet
like
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
caramel
that
is
excellent
you
can
taste
the
strong
alcohol
content
after
the
chocolate
caramel
taste
the
drinkability
is
high
for
me
because
its
not
expensive
and
this
is
an
excellent
dopplebock
nice
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
smallish
head
that
leaves
just
a
little
lacing
aroma
is
of
caramel
toffee
and
other
such
sweets
eminating
from
a
malty
base
the
first
taste
is
sweet
on
the
tounge
from
the
rich
malts
with
a
hint
of
coffee
in
there
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinner
than
youd
think
with
a
bit
of
a
finishing
kick
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
have
once
in
a
while
but
not
really
a
session
drink
taste
caramel
toffee
with
a
little
faint
chocolate
bitterness
low
carbonation
and
somewhat
chewy
decent
body
an
honest
dark
rich
and
satisfying
lager
drinkability
this
is
a
great
doppelbock
ranks
right
up
there
with

with
me
if
not
a
tad
higher
wasnt
expecting
a
taste
this
good
very
impressed

a

that
were

creamy
and
smooth

without

i
have
to
start
by
saying
the
new
label
on
this
one
is
lights
out
amazing
billed
as
a
triplebock
holy
ale
it
shows
the
hand
of
some
spiritual
leader
marking
the
forehead
of
the
mikkeller
character
but
instead
of
the
as
wednesday
cross
its
the
mikkeller
hat
so
sweet
love
it
oh
and
the
beer
inside
the
bottle
here
is
also
one
of
a
kind
at
least
in
my
experience
only
loosely
a
bock
as
we
know
them
malty
red
shaded
dark
brown
sugar
color
with
a
lasting
and
expansive
white
milky
head
that
looks
like
star
san
all
shaken
up
in
insane
concentrations
oozing
out
of
a
carboy
the
nose
is
understated
compared
to
the
flavor
but
you
dont
realize
that
at
first
because
of
course
you
smell
it
before
you
taste
it
and
its
unassuming
malty
and
sweet
not
unlike
other
big
bocks
but
the
flavor
is
radical
its
germany
meets
belgium
meets
denmark
in
a
style
that
was
never
even
real
well
defined
to
start
with
genius
starts
sweet
and
grainy
like
unfermented
wort
with
a
hint
of
soy
sauce
on
the
finish
but
not
gross
salty
soy
gentle
subtle
soy
like
you
might
find
mixed
with
honey
in
some
otherworldy
glaze
that
is
how
this
thing
finishes
not
stupidly
complex
but
pulling
about
as
much
flavor
out
of
grain
as
possible
brewers
magic
here
like
nothing
else
and
if
this
is
lagered
like
most
bocks
are
or
are
meant
to
be
then
even
greater
props
for
it
full
body
and
its
sweet
on
the
front
end
without
being
overly
thick
and
yet
the
finish
thins
out
a
little
and
certainly
isnt
very
sweet
at
all
which
is
shocking
and
unique
and
extremely
pleasant
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
one
except
regretting
how
long
i
took
to
finally
try
one
this
may
be
the
final
evolution
of
bock
as
a
style
its
that
good
update
january
2014
had
another
bottle
of
it
a
big
bottle
with
mrs
gollem
yes
and
i
feel
the
need
to
up
the
grade
a
little
bit
my
my
what
a
mouthful
of
delicious
beer
this
is
still
a
bit
too
dark
for
me
but
man
it
is
so
full
and
rich
im
looking
at
the
empty
bottle
and
the
last
sip
from
half
an
hour
ago
is
still
with
mealmost
like
espresso
in
the
back
of
my
mouth
bottle
pours
creamy
brown
with
tall
tan
head
aroma
is
caramel
and
blackstrap
molasses
taste
incorporates
those
flavors
with
bread
and
cocoa
thin
and
oily
body
not
as
heavy
as
expected
which
was
a
nice
surprise
alcohol
hidden
well
a
nice
representative
of
this
style
o
mikkeller
continues
to
deliver
my
girlfriend
put
it
best
when
she
said
its
like
a
lighter
bodied
quad
well
worth
the
14
for
a
750
ml
initially
this
is
a
sweet
fruity
beer
lots
of
sugary
rum
raisins
maple
syrup
candy
the
carbonation
stays
with
this
one
and
for
me
theres
a
bit
too
much
of
it
that
said
there
is
smoothness
to
it
its
not
as
creamy
as
most
bocks
but
theres
a
velvety
texture
that
lasts
after
the
first
wave
of
sweetness
then
we
get
some
spice
and
some
sour
along
with
the
sweet
orange
marmalade
candied
ginger
fivespice
burnt
sugar
booze
a
sipper
for
sure
od
a
pretty
nice
doppelbock
complex
and
strong
with
a
nice
sipping
character
complexity
and
a
good
flavour
with
new
notes
im
picking
up
on
as
i
go
a
nice
beer
that
deserves
time
and
attention
good
stuff
overall
this
beer
is
outstanding
as
it
got
to
room
temperature
so
many
more
of
the
rich
flavors
made
themselves
present
i
think
the
high
alcohol
may
have
suppressed
some
of
the
flavor
that
you
may
get
in
other
bocks
but
there
is
a
different
level
added
by
the
high
abv
another
awesome
bomber
by
mikkeller
looking
forward
to
more
overall
a
fantastic
interplay
of
intense
flavours
that
somewhat
ironically
mellows

frelser
is
a
seamless
dopplebock
that
weaves
together
a
lot
of
varying
and
challenging
flavors
that
are
otherwise
hard

wrangle

the
beer
is

this

its
hard
to
believe
its

oh
wait
im
feeling
it
now
as
finish
my
first
glass
o
extra
tasty
and
drinkable
super
pumped
on
this
highly
recommended
o
i
grabbed
3
more
bottles
of
this
for
myself
and
3
more
for
trades
it
was
fabulous
and
great
to
get
through
the
lcbo
loads
of
flavour
and
the
cocoa
and
coffee
malts
over
the
fruity
notes
traditionally
found
in
the
style
make
for
a
delectable
treat
for
a
solo
attempt
at
a
11
750ml
i
had
no
issues
downing
the
entire
thing
im
not
sure
if
thats
a
good
or
a
bad
thing
im
curious
how
this
would
age
with
the
hops
fading

its
drinking
great

at

itll
get
you
warmed
up
real
fast
this
is

stuff
im
pretty
sure
its
the
best
bock
ive
tried
complex
and
very
drinkable
be
wary
of
the
high
abv
though
this
one
is
for
sharing
overall
very
nice
not
always
a
huge
doppelbock
fan
but
i
like
this
beer
im
tempted
to
call
frelser
a
german
doppelbock
in
american
dress
but
that
would
take
away
from
its
complexity
the
more
of
this
750ml
bottle
i
drink
the
less
i
feel
to
prepared
to
say
its
such
an
interesting
beer
that
no
general
statement
can
safely
be
made
about
it
interesting
does
not
always
or
even
often
translate
to
good
but
in
this
case
it
has
mikkeller
puts
out
a
bunch
of
beers
not
worth
their
price
tags
but
this
one
is
m
medium
body
with
a
really
big
chew
at
times
light
to
moderate
carbonation
overall
good
beer
drinks
much
more
like
a
barleywine
than
a
triple
bock
in
my
opinion
put
together
well
and
has
a
good
balance
can
see
this
one
doing
well
in
the
cellar
for
a
couple
of
years
to
smooth
it
out
put
down
the
whole
750ml
without
too
much
trouble
would
likely
buy
again
o
big
bocks
are
typically
not
my
favourite
style
but
this
one
is
the
exception
it
reminds
me
of
the
nogne
ris
and
i
will
definitely
be
grabbing
a
few
more
before
they
are
gone
with
a
brew
this
complex
you
do
not
always
get
it
but
i
definitely
got
this
one
well
done
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights

some

some

otherwise
undetected
dark

some

flavours
with
raisins
and
plums
creamy
and
lightly
carbonated
full
body
with
a
good
weight
and
feel
solid
stuff
here
and
very
enjoyable
a
lot
going
on
here
and
initially
if
i
tasted
this
blind
i
would
have
thought
this
was
an
american
strong
ale
but
the
doppelbock
flavours
are
a
little
more
pronounced
as
this
warms
really
good
stuff
here
o
i
really
do
enjoy
mikkeller
beers
i
think
this
is
probably
their
best
one
of
the
bunch
ive
tried
whats
really
nice
is
here
at
the
lcbo
the
price
is
almost
6
dollars
less
than
everywhere
ive
seen
in
the
states
so
ill
have
to
pick
up
more
my
first
mikkeller
brew
did
not
disappoint
but
nor
did
it
completely
blow
me
out
of
the
water
still
this
is
an
intriguing
beer
full
of
flavour
and
well
worth
pondering
over
a
crisp
easter
weekend
the
price
tag
is
of
course
expensive
13
but
what
did
you
expect
definitely
worth
a
onetime
go
a
nice
beer
to
be
sure
this
isnt
a
traditional
doppelbock
though
with
a
firm
chalky
hop
presence

o
pretty
nice
sipper
imagine
a
supercharged
hot
sweet
doppelbock
overall
having
both
the
elements
of
a
trippel
and
a
doppelbock
strong
but
not
overpowering
surprising
given
its
11
abv
not
too
heavy
very
enjoyable
d
this
beer
utterly
disregards
the
bock
style
and
instead
delivers
a
hop
bomb
while
its
a
decent
brew
i
think
its
inappropriate
to
classify
it
as
a
triplebock
pours
a
deep
amber
to
black
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
oatmeal
and
a
small
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
a
sweet
roast
alcohol
and
a
nice
chocolate
presence
a
small
alcohol
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
a
dry
alcohol
and
roast
in
the
aftertaste
a
bit
boozy
but
a
nice
chocolate
and
roast
overpriced
for
the
quality
notes
nothing
for
the
history
books
but
certainly
an
enticing
offering
doppelbock
are
often
not
something
i
would
necessarily
go
after
maybe
precisely
because
this
one
strays
away
somewhat
from
style
i
found
it
more
enjoyable
overall
i
think
theres
a
good
dopplebock
foundation
but
the
alcohol
dominates
i
normally
have
no
issue
with
a
high
alcohol
brew
but
in
this
beer
the
alcohol
seems
to
overpower
some
of
the
other
flavors
the
beer
tastes
like
its
been
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
in
a
way
it
reminds
me
of
central
waters
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
with
all
of
the
malt
sweetness
and
the
high
alcohol
this
would
get
a
higher
rating
for
taste
if
the
alcohol
were
lower
o
a
pretty
good
beer
from
mikkeller
my
first
trippel
bock
but
similar
to
some
beers
ive
tried
id
say
its
a
tastier
less
boozy
samiclaus
classic
this
is
something
id
look
to
have
again
at
some
point
in
the
future
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
this
one
has
a
lot
of
different
flavors
mixed
into
it
but
it
comes
off
rather
smooth
for
the
smell
and
the
look
this
seems
a
bit
disapointing
id
drink
this
again
but
there
are
other
beers
that
i
would
try
first
to
me
the
malt
is
a
tad
strong
and
once
i
got
a
glass
into
this
that
is
what
i
picked
up
on
the
most
good
for
a
sample
if
you
like
malt
i
suspect
this
will
be
right
up
your
alley

served
in
a

the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownruby
red
color
with
about
an
inch
frothy
tan
head
the
head
stays
around
for
a
long
time
and
theres
a
lot
of
lacing
left
behind
on
the
glass
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
it
smells
like
toffee
brown
sugar
molasses
dark
fruit
plums
raisins
caramel
malt
and
some
booze
the
taste
of
this
brew
isnt
quite
as
sweet
in
comparison
to
the
aroma
the
flavors
are
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
theres
a
good
amount
of
bready
maltgrain
and
a
little
bit
of
licorice
noticeable
too
it
is
a
little
boozy
but
it
doesnt
seem
like
im
drinking
an
11
abv
beer
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
chewy
slick
and
well
carbonated
i
thought
it
was
a
very
nice
brew
i
liked
it
at
13

a
bottle
id
buy
this
one
again
i
think
its
worth
trying
lovely
beer
a
bit
malt
bomb
to
savour
lovely
balance
struck
a
real
flavorful
doppelbock
that
will
probably
only
get
better
with
age
a
really
out
of
balance
triple
bock
pours
a
ruddy
dark
chestnut
with
a
thick
creamy
finger
of
head
that
does
leave
a
nice
lacy
trail
in
its
wake
the
nice
is
full
of
rich
caramel
malts
raisins
and
prunes
along
with
a
slight
oak
barrel
quality
the
taste
brings
caramel
malts
that
are
borderline
too
sweet
without
much
else
it
comes
across
as
almost
having
a
straight
shot
od
grain
alcohol
being
dumped
into
really
out
of
whack
and
unpleasantly
strong
tasting
to
me
stone
old
guardian
was
the
only
thing
as
similar
and
the
only
beer
that
i
have
drank
that
i
would
say
was
worse
o
pretty
easy
to
drink
beer
and
fairly
flavorful
a
pleasant
surprise
d
definitely
the
easiest
drinking
triple
bock
ive
had
not
a
superb
beer
but
good
for
the
style
and
not
something
id
turn
down
if
offered
not
sure
why
this
needed
to
come
in
750ml
bottles
though
drinks
well
especially
for
the
strength
boozy
but
not
harsh
a
nice
warming
slow
sipper
an
agreeably
drinkable
bigass
doppelbock
oh
my
yes
a
tripel
of
the
same
accord
im
not
going
to
wank
on
beer
etymology
so
ill
just
say
whatever
the
hell
they
call
it
im
in
if
named
in
danish
at
that
only
for
the
wellhidden
triple
or
quad
level
abv
this
is
still
one
enjoyably
tasty
and
bombworthy
monster
bock
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
good
offwhite
head
and
a
bit
of
light
lacing
the
nose
is
roasty
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
some
dark
fruits
there
is
also
a
very
small
amount
of
smokey
character
in
the
background
the
taste
is
lightly
smoked
and
roasty
and
also
carries
a
nice
dark
fruit
presence
impressively
the
alcohol
in
this
is
not
really
all
that
detectable
the
body
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
dry
which
some
plum
character
being
accentuated
in
the
finish
a
good
beer
though
i
certainly
would
have
preferred
a
375
of
thisa
750
even
split
up
is
a
bit
much
this
is
a
pretty
alright
dopplebock
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
it
doesnt
achieve
the
complexity
or
specialness
that
frelsers
gigantic
pricetag
warrants
so
i
likely
wont
be
returning
to
this
beer
still
worth
a
try
for
big
dopplebock
fans
finally
props
to
the
label
art
its
abstract
and
almost
like
a
rorschach
test
from
afar
but
up
close
you
see
that
it
is
the
legs
of
a
goat
paying
homage
to
the
traditional
connection
between
bockbier
of
any
sort
and
goats
on
their
labels
a
full
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
that
is
prickly
on
the
tongue
quite
a
warming
brew
that
makes
for
a
decent
sipper
that
is
well
balanced
if
you
can
ignore
the
mineralchlorinegreen
taste
pours
a
dark
thick
gem
with
white
head
that
leads
to
alce
from
private
buying
club
big
bold
roasty
aromas
bold
taste
of
roast
coffee
and
chocolate
not
too
thick
still
quite
drinkable
alcohol
well
hidden
but
it
warms
the
body
and
then
fogs
the
brain
amazing
meal
in
itself
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
sampled
as
part
of
a
4
beer
sampler
the
price
for
this
in
the
bottle
is
probably
in
the
teens
and
outrageous
so
in
smaller
qualtities
it
can
be
enjoyed
an
appreciated
drinkability
dont
let
the
fact
that
its
referred
to
as
a
triplebock
scare
you
off
theres
no
soy
sauce
or
infant
tears
in
this
one
an
excellently
crafted
doppelbock
crisp
clean
flavorful
but
elegant
the
11
if
fooling
no
one
so
take
it
slow
but
give
it
a
shot
if
you
see
it
d
tasty
for
11
abv
this
is
very
drinkable
although
for
the
money
ill
take
troegenator
over
this
any
day
bottle
poured
a
deep
amber
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
very
good
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
with
notes
of
warming
alcohol
and
light
caramel
notes
taste
is
also
a
nice
enough
mix
between
some
caramel
malt
with
light
fruity
ester
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
some
alcohol
was
apparent
ok
but
still
quite
different
from
some
staple
of
the
style
lacking
some
ester
that
i
usually
associate
with
the
style
an
interesting
take
on
the
doppelbock
style
and
perhaps
a
sign
of
things
to
come
if
tripelbock
becomes
instated
within
the
community
the
hops
overshadow
everything
else
with
authority
leaving
a
bit
of
a
hodgepodge
to
be
deciphered
when
all
is
said
and
done
would
have
been
nice
to
have
some
balance
in
the
flavour
with
all
the
notes
present
in
the
aroma
and
we
all
thought
there
was
only
one
triple
bock
hell
this
is
now
the
third
ive
come
across
it
pours
a
slightly
clear
deep
dark
ruby
brown
topped
by
a
finger
of
thick
sturdy
light
tan
froth
the
nose
comprises
graham
crackers
dark
wheat
black
pepper
brown
sugar
nutmeg
rye
bread
pumpernickel
cinnamon
figs
and
what
seems
like
a
handful
o
raspberries
the
taste
is
very
similar
though
the
berries
come
through
stronger
leading
to
a
bit
of
a
cardamomy
flavor
near
the
end
the
breads
in
the
nose
are
toasted
a
bit
and
some
roasted
marshmallows
are
added
to
the
proceedings
honestly
im
not
sure
of
this
bottle
is
infected
hence
the
slightly
sour
bit
at
the
end
but
even
if
it
is
it
isnt
yet
a
problem
the
body
is
a
rather
hefty
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
pretty
smooth
feel
overall
another
very
nice
brew
from
the
danish
gypsies
and
on
further
sips
any
thought
of
infection
has
left
my
mind
instead
thoughts
of
this
shits
tasty
have
taken
over
get
some
d
well
you
certainly
wouldnt
make
a
habit
of
downing
pints
of
this
but
this
is
definitely
not
hard
to
quaff
there
is
no
noticeable
booze
in
the
mouth
but
i
can
feel
it
in
my
throat
and
in
my
belly
but
this
is
enjoyable
definitely
recommend
this
maybe
a
bit
pricey
but
this
is
definitely
a
tasty
beer
and
im
bummed
that
i
didnt
grab
a
second
bottle
d
for
an
11
beer
this
one
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
i
would
watch
out
as
it
would
probably
creep
up
on
you
nice
flavors
all
around
from
the
sweet
caramel
to
the
chocolatelike
finish
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
red
highlights
and
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
roasted
malt
toffee
dark
fruit
and
a
little
bit
of
something
that
resembles
trash
the
flavor
is
dark
fruit
toffee
roasted
malt
and
surprisingly
no
alcohol
the
beer
is
very
dry
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
pretty
lofting
rating
so
far
not
sure
its
that
good
but
its
pretty
decent
overall
i
certainly
would
classify
this
more
of
a
doppelbock
than
a
bock
based
on
complexity
its
very
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
but
the
sweetness
begins
to
wear
on
me
after
one
glass
a
well
done
beer
in
a
style
im
not
terribly
fond
of
worth
a
shot
even
more
so
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
d
the
only
thing
keeping
the
d
score
from
being
a
5
is
that
the
abv
but
im
not
sure
how
often
id
want
to
revisit
this
johnm0
o
a
good
doppelbock
i
would
love
this
in
the
restaurant
with
some
cheesecake
wonderfully
clean
and
malty
pure
silky
sweet
excellent
example
of
the
style
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
doppelbocks
but
this
offering
from
starr
hill
is
imho
exceptional
the
appearance
is
a
bit
off
in
that
it
is
a
bit
too
dark
for
the
style
but
the
clarity
and
fine
wreath
of
persistant
foam
are
perfect
the
aromq
is
a
bit
understated
but
with
a
nice
swirl
in
my
handwarmed
goblet
stimulated
a
beatiful
caramelly
malt
cloud
very
appropriate
the
flavor
is
what
aces
this
beer
for
me
very
well
balanced
between
a
rich
malty
sweetness
balanced
by
a
spicy
but
gentle
hop
backbone
snd
a
dry
mouthfeel
speaking
of
that
many
doppels
are
syrupy
or
teacley
but
not
this
one
again
bery
nice
balance
of
dryness
spice
and
malty
sweet
ess
with
a
touch
of
caramel
the
finish
is
clean
and
dry
well
done
sweet
and
malty
with
some
caramel
and
licorice
notes
overall
wow
this
one
is
one
of
the
few
beers
so
far
that
really
amazed
me
the
first
time
i
had
it
and
its
just
as
tasty
as
i
remembered
the
second
time
around
yeah
this
is
good
stuff
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
so
far
and
by
far
my
favorite
from
the
starr
hill
variety
pack
if
the
fact
that
this
is
only
rated
good
on
hererather
than
very
good
or
outstandingmeans
that
other
doppelbocks
i
havent
tried
yet
are
even
better
then
ill
definitely
have
to
seek
out
more
in
this
style
in
the
future
excellent
dopplebock
add
this
to
my
list
of
winter
go
to
nice
dark
tasty
good
sipping
beer
overall
i
really
really
like
this
beer
its
a
massive
malt
bomb
which
im
a
fan
of
nicely
sweetened
and
flavorful
highly
recommended
for
fans
of
malt
overall
this
is
a
doppelbock
that
has
neither
the
rich
nutty
taste
nor
the
strong
malts
of
other
doppelbocks
o
easy
enough
to
drink
and
enjoyable
but
not
exceptional
probably
would
not
go
for
it
again
but
not
unhappy
to
have
tried
it
alcohol
is
well
hidden
o
mouthfeel
medium
body
sticky
for
a
lager
very
bitter
not
a
pleasant
after
taste
it
was
drinkable
but
for
me
it
wasnt
enjoyable
this
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
1219
pours

drinkable
doppelbock

honestly
not
bad
after
tipping
over
a
cornhole
players
beer
i
bought
this
for
him
great
flavor
a
screwtop
bottle
made
it
easier
for
me
to
get
started
but
i
was
startled
when
i
got
foam
coming
through
the
neck
right
afterwards
i
quickly
began
the
pour
and
i
got
some
pseudocascading
action
as
it
generated
some
tawny
head
head
retention
was
very
low
however
and
quickly
turned
into
a
skim
of
wisps
atop
the
beer
color
was
a
darkbrown
with
ruby
highlights
srm

with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
sugary
malty
sweet
with
an
alcohol
burn
that
tickled
my
nostrils
this
may
get
me
where
i
am
going
in
one
quick
hurry
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
of
caramel
anise
malt
husks
and
of
course
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
burn
for
good
measure
man
but
this
was
super
sweet
as
compared
to
the
aipas
that
i
usually
drink
and
i
began
to
sweat
as
a
result
finish
was
sweet
no
two
ways
about
it
and
the
alcohol
burn
was
literally
breathtaking
in
the
throat
phew
one
of
these
at
a
time
please
no
wonder
the
monks
could
be
held
over
all
day
after
one
bro
woody
has
spoken
o
overall
pretty
decent
flavor
wise
nice
finish
decent
and
perhaps
a
few
shades
light
of
a
good
recommendation
but
nothing
to
get
to
finicky
about
onot
terrible
but
not
nearly
as
fullflavored
as
its
german
originators
o
i
like
this
doppelbock
it
lacks
the
complexity
of
say
a
celebrator
but
its
a
very
nice
beer
i
would
like
to
see
it
a
hair
bit
dryer
but
i
would
buy
this
again
o
for
better
or
worse
this
is
a
lighter
doppelbock
its
not
bold
but
its
easy
to
drink
its
only
problem
is
there
are
a
couple
other
examples
out
there
that
are
bold
while
retaining
its
drinkability
i
wouldnt
put
this
one
on
my
must
purchase
again
list
thats
for
sure
good
beer
true
to
style
a
tad
on
the
lighter
side
for
doppelbocks
but
they
didnt
skimp
really
thought
this
was
a
good
approximation
of
the
style
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
then
you
should
check
this
beer
out
pours
a
clear
ruby
brown
color
not
really
any
head
sweet
and
nutty
aroma
all
malt
no
hops
as
expected
for
the
style
taste
is
one
note
slightly
sweet
caramel
malt
okay
flavor
lower
carbonation
full
mouthfeel
but
still
drinks
easy
not
at
the
top
of
its
class
but
a
pretty
good
brew
theres
enought
going
on
to
keep
it
interesting
id
try
it
again
this
strong
bock
has
a
nice
malt
flavor
which
is
in
the
dark
caramel
and
toffee
range
with
some
slight
chewy
raisiny
flavors
and
mild
yeast
elements
in
the
taste
add
to
the
enjoyment
with
subtle
spice
and
an
almost
cereal
like
toastiness
i
think
this
is
a
decent
bock
pretty
apparent
strength
wise
in
the
taste
but
enough
malt
to
fit
the
bill
and
pretty
clean
lager
characteristicsi
would
have
this
again
overall
nothing
too
special
here
it
is
a
decent
run
of
the
mill
doppelbock
enjoyed
from
a
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
dark
with
an
dark
amber
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
head
is
a
caramel
color
and
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
but
dissipates
rather
quickly
typical
double
bock
style
with
a
malty
flavor
and
pretty
low
carbonation
however
this
beer
has
a
sort
of
spice
that
lingers
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
i
can
taste
some
chocolate
and
some
bread
troeginator
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
if
i
had
to
compare
snow
blind
to
it
i
would
say
that
they
are
similar
but
that
troegs
just
tastes
a
little
better
still
a
great
beer
though
i
understand
what
starr
hill
was
going
for
on
there
season
snow
blind
offering
i
think
they
nailed
the
overall
taste
and
finish
of
the
beer
very
delicate
and
complex
upfront
and
great
going
down
almost
too
smooth
for
a
dopplebock
the
biggest
detractor
was
nose
at
first
sip
the
caramel
aroma
was
weak
and
had
a
slightly
off
aroma
to
it
if
smell
is
not
very
important
to
you
this
beer
is
perfect
for
a
late
nightcap
by
the
fireplace
o
my
first
few
steps
i
liked
it
it
had
a
spiciness
of
a
winter
beer
the
taste
didnt
grow
on
me
though
there
are
some
interesting
flavors
and
it
does
fit
the
seasonal
style
but
my
palette
was
left
wanting
a
little
more
body
overall
a
slightly
sweet
take
on
the
doppelbock
style
not
bad
just
could
be
a
little
less
sweet
for
my
liking
flavors
are
appropriate
and
strength
is
good
o
just
weird
flavors
here
that
make
for
an
uncharacteristic
doppelbock
not
like
the
doppelbocks
that
im
used
to
this
is
one
of
the
stronger
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
by
feel
not
by
abv
very
aggressive
features
and
something
youll
want
to
sip
not
an
easy
beer
to
drink
but
something
to
enjoy
as
you
nurse
it
for
an
hour
o
good
double
bock
or
winter
warmer
although
i
prefer
one
sweeter
and
more
malt
dominated
than
this
fairly
strong
spicy
version
o
3
50
if
this
was
labelled
christmas
ale
or
something
i
would
believe
it
it
has
a
hint
of
some
spices
that
remind
me
a
of
a
christmas
seasonal
the
sweetness
gets
a
little
cloying
over
time
so
it
is
a
sipper

as

this
beer
just
has
no

perhaps
i
dont
have
a
favorable

overall
a
superb
beer
not
as
dark

chewy
as

dopplebocks

do
the
dilligence
where
the

may
have
left

lay
this

could
be

to
lengthen

based
off

like
the

at
all
spoiled
the
whole
experience
pours
a

with

the
most
impressive
things
about
this
beer
are
how
the
malty
flavors
coat
your
mouth
and
considering
the
high
abv
how
unboozy
it
tastes
smuttynose
has
done
an
excellent
job
at
replicating
a

bravo
great
doppelbock
not
as
great
as
some
original
german
versions
but
still
very
pleasant
overall

flavor
does
not
remind

reminds
me
more
of
an

or
something

the

good
stuff
overall
a
delicious
beer
for
the
style
nice
chewy
body
with
just
enough
hop
bite
b
overall
decidedly
malty
with
an
emphasis
on
toffee
sweetness
this
one
is
on
the
richer
side
even
for
the
style
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
the
nigh
onedimensional
flavor
profile
makes
it
hard
to
enjoy
even
past
half
a
glass
ayinger
celebrator
it
is
not
its
not
dislikeable
but
a
hint
of
balance
coffee
or
dark
malt
roastiness
would
go
a
long
way
o
a
very
nice
american
doppelbock
that
combines
the
huge
maltiness
with
some
nice
fruity
esters
and
alcohol
impressively
easy
to
drink
at
just
under
10
great
value
and
definitely
worth
picking
up
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
it
seems
this
would
fare
well
with
age
clearly
i
didnt
age
this
and
so
i
can
say
while
tasty
fresh
it
does
complete
with
an
abrasive
bite
cheers
poured
to
a
nice
dark
copper
amber
color
with
a
dense
tan
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
aroma
had
nice
malt
and
bread
notes
taste
had
strong
notes
of
malt
bread
and
some
molassas
with
traces
of
caramel
great
mouth
feel
creamy
and
full
aftertaste
was
sweet
and
lingering
i
can
see
it
going
to
5
or
6
possibly
i
would
imagine
the
maltprune
will
start
to
be
more
forward
with
a
little
bit
more
mellow
on
the
alcohol
needless
to
say
this
3
year
old
one
was
damn
near
perfection
way
better
when
you
drink
it
at
the
recommended
temperature
so
let
it
get
there
before
consuming
i
have
to
try
a
fresh
one
to
compare
but
this
made
my
pallet
go
crazy
alcohol
was
non
bullying
and
complimented
the
balance
between
the
bitterness
and
sweetness
im
sooo
surprised
that
this
beer
still
remains
perfectly
hop
balanced
even
3
years
in
this
is
an
absolute
must
try
for
dopplebock
lovers
but
i
would
be
carefull
if
you
arent
into
a
big
phenomenally
tasting
beer
at
9
abv
this
beer
could
have
been
a
booze
bomb
however
i
thought
it
to
be
very
quaffable
and
inviting
but
those
of
us
who
know
anything
about
this
style
one
with
its
own
season
in
munich
starkbierzeit
are
well
aware
of
an
underlying
potency
this
strong
beer
should
not
be
taken
for
granted
o
nothing
too
special
it
is
a
big
beer
but
its
largely
forgettable
unless
you
really
like
double
bocks
you
can
pretty
much
pass
on
this
22oz
bomber
this
one
pours
a
fairly
clear
dark
ambermahogany
color
there
was
about
a
finger
of
a
khaki
colored
head
on
it
that
didnt
linger
long
but
left
some
lacing
this
one
has
a
nice
nose
lots
of
malts
yet
there
isnt
much
sweetness
coming
through
caramel
dark
fruits
are
the
main
components
maybe
some
toffee
also
the
taste
is
excellent
a
hint
of
sweetness
tons
of
malts
faint
roasted
malts
smooth
overall
an
excellent
doppelbock
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
i
love
living
2530
minutes
from
the
grocery
store
but
being
able
to
pick
up
great
beer
at
the
local
general
store
up
the
road
overall
its
pretty
darn
solid
its
nose
reminds
me
of
classic
ayinger
but
a
very
different
flavor
profile
its
still
a
real
good
doppelbock
for
sure
this
is
full
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
there
is
nothing
fancy
here
just
a
good
solid
dopplebock
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
doppelbock
style
smuttonator
is
a
must
try
overall
not
a
big
overly
complex
beer
but
rather
simple
and
true
to
its
style
it
is
an
enjoying
beer
to
sip
without
having
to
think
about
it
too
much
straightforward
and
so
easy
to
drink
to
the
point
it
is
dangerous
well
its
a
malt
bomb
alright
smells
and
tastes
of
caramel
brown
sugar
toffee
molasses
and
plum
pudding
with
extra
bits
of
red
portsoaked
bread
on
the
side
actually
the
flavor
has
a
slightly
higher
level
of
breadiness
and
dark
fruit
emphasis
than
the
nose
does
and
the
nose
has
a
slightly
higher
level
of
booziness
than
the
flavor
actually
presents
to
the
tongue
i
can
only
find
a
faint
garnish
of
earthy
and
herbal
hopping
on
the
back
side
of
the
finish
and
even
than
only
once
the
glass
has
warmed
up
my
token
constructive
criticism
would
be
to
amplify
the
noble
hops
slightly
to
temper
down
the
sweet
malts
a
bit
and
allow
some
nutty
malt
tones
to
shine
through
still
this
beer
ranks
up
there
amongst
the
top
15
doppelbocks
ive
had
so
its
certainly
worth
trying
overall
incredible
value
and
one
to
be
sipped
to
enjoy
its
flavor
and
at
8
5
abv
not
one
to
be
slugged
down
on
an
emptystomach
its
my
meal
in
a
glass
after
my
meal
on
a
plate
overall
a
solid
offering
for
a
dopplebock
nothing
over
the
top
just
true
to
style
with
no
frills
this
certainly
held
up
over
time
its
similarly
good
fresh
in
my
humble
opinion
this
is
one
of
the
best
dopplebocks
brewed
this
side
of
the
atlantic
definitely
worth
a
try
buy
a
few
bottles
and
age
some
overall
holds
up
well
to
4
years
2
would
probably
be
ideal
nice
take
on
the
style
with
some
good
depth
very
malt
forward
a
little
raw
when
fresh
perhaps
better
suited
for
january
than
august
but
still
its
very
good
a
nice
sipper
d
very
drinkable
nicely
balanced
doppelbock
with
a
good
strong
and
complex
malt
profile
o
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
like
it
not
my
favorite
from
smuttynose
but
i
like
it
a
malt
lovers
dream
but
not
a
enough
hops
for
a
hophead
like
me
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
though
and
overall
pretty
good

when
i
opened
it
and
it
gained
a
bit
more
heat
as
it
warmed
up
overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
doppelbock
nice
flavor
balance
and
complexity
and
pretty
smooth
to
sip
on
got
a
little
bit
boozy
as
it
warmed
up
but
was
still
a
highly
enjoyable
brew
o
a
really
nice
brew
from
smutty
in
an
underappreciated
style
good
doppel
served
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
nice
thick
creamy
creamcolored
head
that
slowly
settles
to
a
partial
thin
cover
and
ring
with
some
lace
color
is
a
clear
orange
copper
with
a
few
bubble
trails
aroma
is
malt
brandy
toffee
a
little
caramel
flavor
is
like
nose
and
sweeter
today
than
when
i
first
had
it
last
night
and
more
boozy
too
body
is
good
ditto
carbonation
finsish
is
like
flavor
and
has
a
very
mild
brandylike
warming
tasty
brau
served
ontap
at
deciccos
in
new
york
it
pours
a
brown
tone
with
close
to
a
finger
of
tan
head
the
nose
has
nuts
dates
and
chocolate
taste
of
this
double
bock
contains
malts
caramel
hops
and
more
of
the
nuts
a
sweet
but
rich
flavor
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
very
nice
representation
of
this
style
from
these
good
people
out
of
new
hampshire
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
brown
sugar
aromas
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
some
slight
fruity
flavors
as
well
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
american
take
on
a
doppelbock
o
overall
an
average
take
on
the
style
very
very
intense
in
flavor
it
doesnt
have
the
mellowyetrobust
flavor
of
say
a
celebrator
a
very
strong
beer
that
demands
your
attention
but
maybe
doesnt
deserve
it
entirely
o
alcohol
is
not
as
well
hidden
as
i
might
have
liked
with
this
beer
but
it
is
still
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
i
like
the
hints
of
spiciness
and
i
could
definitely
sip
this
one
for
a
while
o
i
dont
know
what
all
the
rave
reviews
are
about
definitely
not
the
best
in
the
big
beer
series
try
the
farmhouse
ale
for
a
better
success
story
overall
this
wasnt
bad
and
is
a
great
value
at
5
99
a
bomber
that
said
this
doesnt
hold
a
light
to
the
traditional
german
doppelbocks
out
there
a
real
quality
dopplebock
a
good
malty
side
to
it
and
it
does
the
style
well
this
beer
touches
all
the
bases
and
is
excellent
very
smooth
and
velvety
a
beer
to
savor
thanks
smutty
heavy
body
with
mid
to
high
level
of
carbonation
leads
this
to
a
beer
thats
a
bit
antagonistic
on
the
palate
but
also
foams
up
quickly
to
be
soft
and
pillowy
after
the
initial
burn
oa
nice
malt
forward
beer
although
still
in
the
hophead
category
a
well
done
malt
bomb
like
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
overall
as
a
part
of
smuttys
big
beer
series
this
brew
carries
its
own
complexly
sweet
with
an
extremely
delicious
and
lingering
finish
one
to
be
enjoyed
over
an
evening
or
with
a
thirsty
friend
lots
of
sweet
toasty
malts
add
some
yeast
and
you
get
rich
bread
with
a
caramelized
plum
and
purple
grape
jam
maybe
some
blackberries
too
syrupy
palate
with
a
little
heat
the
alcohol
comes
together
with
teh
flavors
and
palate
well
this
is
an
awesome
doppelbock
o
what
a
doppelbock
i
swear
smutty
is
one
of
those
breweries
that
a
bulk
of
the
country
does
just
not
know
about
smuttonator
is
so
smooth
and
flavorful
that
i
am
going
back
to
my
store
and
buying
a
few
more
bottles
off
the
shelf
tomorrow
do
very
drinkable
even
with
the
booziness
one
of
the
better
dopplebocks
ive
ever
had
hats
off
to
smutty
thanks
to
drewshal9
for
this
one
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
reddish
highlights
massive
two
finger
dense
cocoa
head
which
lingers
for
a
bit
not
as
dark
as
id
expect
but
a
good
looking
brew
i
get
mainly
caramel
malt
sugar
and
slight
fruit
in
the
nose
its
pleasant
although
a
little
weak
maybe
warming
will
help
a
little
the
taste
is
nice
caramel
malt
toffee
fruit
hops
w
a
slight
alcohol
burn
on
the
back
end
i
wish
the
nose
smelled
more
like
this
its
very
good
mouthfeel
is
bready
chewy
w
a
giant
malt
presence
to
it
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
there
are
better
in
the
style
but
this
is
solid
cheers
yummy
pick
it
up
pours
a

5
toasted

mild
medicinal
hopping
medium
to
full
bodied
feel
but
thins
out
and
finishes
with
a
booze
cola
feel
carbonation
is
high
and
fizzy
and
i
get
the
impression
that
it
would
be
a
lot
better
slightly
less
attenuated
i
like
smutty
a
bunch
but
im
not
digging
this
one
despite
the
phenomenal
name
bottled
conditioned
in
2011
overall
one
of
the
very
best
doppelbocks
ive
ever
tasted
definitely
the
best
from
the
usa
by
far
o
a
fantastic
beer
would
highly
recommend
i
feel
lucky
to
have
had
this
one
on
tap
easily
one
of
the
best
offerings
i
have
had
from
smuttynose
smuttonator
is
a
terrific
dopplebock
a
festive
beer
that
packs
a
punch
and
should
be
a
seasonal
staple
for
lovers
of
the
style
excellent
and
one
i
will
not
miss
next
fall
o
this
was
actually
remarkable
for
the
style
no
question
id
have
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
das
this
one
warms
the
ease
of
drinking
goes
up
it
starts
out
a
little
one
note
when
still
a
little
chilled
with
a
spicy
bitterness
but
the
malt
backbone
really
shines
as
it
warms
o
this
is
a
very
satisfying
doppelbock
flavors
are
very
rich
i
am
not
sure
how
old
this
is
but
i
could
see
it
benefiting
from
some
time
in
the
cellar
will
have
to
check
on
my
next
trip
across
the
border
to
see
whether
any
more
can
be
procured
meanwhile
well
done
smuttynose
poured
2010
vintage
into
a
20
oz
giant
duvel
tulip
glass
beer
is
probably
15
months
old
give
or
take
poured
fairly
aggressive
and
got
a
huge
3
inch
fluffy
white
head
that
doesnt
settle
quick
at
all
lots
of
lacing
color
when
held
up
to
light
very
bright
ruby
red
smell
is
dark
fruits
raisins
fig
brown
sugar
and
a
breadyness
taste
is
all
of
that
with
raisins
fig
and
hard
candy
flavor
dominant
even
after
a
year
booze
is
present
mouth
feel
is
large
nice
amount
of
life
for
the
abv
and
age
would
be
lying
if
i
called
it
overly
drinkable
a
sipper
for
sure
i
like
this
for
the
style
but
my
tastes
have
become
very
hop
dominant
malt
lovers
dream
here
i
feel
this
is
a
complex
malt
driven
brew
that
is
a
must
try
for
all
serious
beer
drinkers
odnot
very
impressed
booze
is
too
blatant
am
going
to
struggle
drinking
this
whole
bomber
that
being
said
it
isnt
awful
just
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
im
just
glad
it
doesnt
taste
like
other
smuttys
ive
had
before
overall
im
disappointed
either
with
my
past
memory
or
an
apparent
recipe
change
i
dont
know
ill
revisit
this
vintage
with
a
little
more
time
on
it
in
hopes
the
heat
backs
off
mouthfeel
is
great
on
this
one
a
solid
full
body
and
nice
carbonation
alcohol
provides
a
wonderful
warming
sensation
with
the
finish
overall
a
nice
brew
for
a
chilly
evening
and
another
winner
from
the
big
beer
series
i
expected
to
love
this
beer
but
sorry
i
dont
poured
almost
all
head
beige
color
long
lasting
smell
is
really
quite
mild
yes
theres
malt
but
its
not
a
complex
malt
smell
color
is
a
hazy
rusty
brown
taste
is
indeed
malty
but
again
its
not
a
complex
malt
and
to
be
honest
i
thought
it
was
kind
of
salty
finally
i
did
expect
the
high
alcohol
yet
this
beer
still
seems
hot
to
me
o
complex
very
enjoyable
beer
i
will
have
to
buy
multiples
of
the
current
vintage
try
one
fresh
age
a
couple
to
see
how
it
improves
but
one
year
out
it
drinks
very
well
tastes
mild
malt
sweet
thats
quickly
overrun
by
carbonation
noticeable
flavor
and
earthy
hop
flavor
there
is
an
acidic
bite
in
the
finish
that
doesnt
fit
in
the
style
nor
with
the
flavors
nor
the
mouthfeel
malt
flavor
is
honey
with
a
dash
of
chocolate
nougat
and
caramel
hop
flavor
is
earthy
but
not
quite
noble
perhaps
a
variant
of
tettnanger
but
not
tettnanger
itself
alcohol
intensity
matches
the
style
and
works
well
with
the
honey
flavor
hop
bitter
is
mild
and
grassy
the
finish
dries
from
alcohol
and
leaves
lingering
hop
flavor
into
the
aftertaste
too
strong
carbonation
and
light
in
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
take
on
the
style
and
almost
a
steal
for
around
5
bucks
a
bomber
i
can
pick
up
the
other
big
beers
for
the
same
price
so
thanks
smuttynose
for
making
these
great
big
beers
so
affordable
overall
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
excellent
and
the
flavors
present
in
the
first
sip
of
this
beer
are
lovely
i
only
wish
that
the
beer
had
better
lasting
power
through
subsequent
sips
as
the
alcohol
did
become
overpowering
after
a
time
very
nice
beer
would
be
especially
good
on
a
cool
evening
medium
amber
brown
body
a
bit
light
for
style
offwhite
head
some
visible
effervescence
with
minimal
lacing
really
noticeable
boozy
nose
stone
fruit
forward
more
raisins
than
prunes
taste
mirrors
nose
with
some
brown
sugar
caramel
and
molasses
notes
along
with
significant
floral
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
a
slight
stickiness
but
very
boozy
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
heat
one
of
the
better
beers
of
the
tasting
wonder
if
some
aging
would
tame
the
booziness
a
bit
o
overall
a
very
good
doppelbock
that
has
held
up
quite
nicely
light
musty
notes
in
the
nose
that
i
would
assume
are
from
the
time
on
it
but
a
good
beer
in
any
event
would
like
to
have
it
again
one
of
the
best
domestic
takes
on
the
style
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
sampling
and
more
than
an
optimtor
clone
altogether
its
all
right
but
probably
not
a
doppelbock
ill
buy
again
o
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
overall
a
delicious
sipper
and
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
definitely
will
have
again
o
yes
a
2008
bottle
consumed
in
2011
the
age
really
mellowed
this
beer
out
and
made
it
smooth
and
sweet
the
sweetness
was
never
cloying
the
caramel
really
stood
out
from
the
aroma
and
transitioned
right
into
the
taste
if
you
get
a
bottle
or
two
i
suggest
aging
it
a
few
years
then
giving
it
try
this
may
be
my
new
favorite
doppelbock
this
is
everything
i
would
like
this
style
of
beer
to
be
and
one
i
would
probably
use
to
introduce
people
to
the
style
overall
nice
but
a
bit
hot
to
be
honest
alcohol
is
rather
present
throughout
given
that
i
say
give
this
beer
a
year
or
so
good
stuff
but
difinately
not
traditional
this
beer
is
really
enjoyable
but
it
doesnt
hide
the
alcohol
quite
well
enough
like
a
great
doppelbock
should
overall
this
was
awesome
i
love
bocks
and
this
was
no
exception
it
definitly
deserves
the
rep
it
has
this
is
a
really
good
dopplebock
and
something
i
am
glad
is
readily
avaibke
to
me
whenever
i
want
it
great
example
of
this
style
very
similar
to
troegenattor
dark
copper
with
a
creamy
white
head
great
retention
and
spiderweb
lace
the
smell
is
sweet
caramels
honey
and
fruits
like
peach
and
pear
the
tast
is
almost
spot
on
big
malt
bomb
of
sweet
malts
caramels
honey
peach
some
earthy
hoppy
notes
in
the
back
with
just
a
little
burn
from
the
high
alcohol
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
rich
big
bodied
beer
overall
tastes
more
like
a
riff
on
a
doppelbock
than
an
actual
doppelbock
but
the
flavors
work
great
together
and
all
the
classic
elements
are
present
very
good
overall
definitely
a
malt
bomb
i
finished
the
bomber
but
the
rich
flavors
take
their
toll
after
awhile
not
a
bad
thing
id
just
prefer
it
in
a
12
oz
next
time
really
great
flavors
another
great
beer
from
smuttynose
22oz
bottle
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
at
50
degrees
bottle
conditioned
in
2010
notched
on
the
label
pours
a
translucent
plum
with
a
dense
creamy
tancolored
head
embedded
with
tiny
craters
head
eventually
settles
into
a
consistent
quarter
inch
cap
thick
swaths
of
lacing
coat
the
sides
of
the
glass
during
the
tasting
nose
reveals
candied
dark
fruits
figs
and
prunes
followed
by
toffee
notes
and
a
trace
of
cocoa
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
the
flavors
are
less
distinct
and
coalesce
much
more
in
the
flavor
profile
the
chocolate
character
is
also
much
more
robust
finally
theres
also
a
residual
alcohol
presence
that
comes
out
towards
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
lively
carbonation
texture
is
somewhere
between
oily
and
creamy
and
theres
a
little
alcohol
heat
at
the
back
end
which
lingers
at
the
back
of
the
throat
what
can
i
say
this
is
one
delicious
doppelbock
and
another
winner
from
smuttys
big
beer
series
i
definitely
need
to
pick
up
another
bottle
to
cellar
o
damn
good
beer
from
a
damn
good
brewery
another
impressive
showing
from
smuttynose
again
get
one
if
you
can
4
55
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
malt
bomb
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
are
a
fan
of
big
malty
beers
appears
a
hazy
dark
orangebrown
color
nice
froth
and
retention
on
this
one
nose
is
lightly
fruity
and
a
hint
of
floral
hops
flavor
is
interesting
fruity
and
malty
with
faint
spices
light
roast
some
banana
wheat
and
very
low
bitterness
the
finish
is
abrupt
if
not
clean
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
very
good
beer
and
representation
of
the
style
great
complexity
and
balance
smutty
continues
to
impress
me
dgreat
example
of
a
dopplebock
highly
recommended
another
big
beer
series
gem
by
smuttynose
overall
pretty
good
not
the
best
doppelbock
ive
had
but
a
nice
offering
from
smuttynose
being
that
it
is
9
5abv
not
8
5
2010
brew
this
is
wonderfully
drinkable
each
drink
you
take
you
feel
something
new
and
makes
you
want
to
keep
drinking
well
done
smuttynose
d
there
is
good
drinkability
here
it
goes
down
easy
and
it
tastes
great
i
really
like
this
beer
and
it
would
take
a
lot
before
i
get
sick
of
drinking
this
one
i
definitely
recommend
trying
this
one
d
the
beer
is
one
that
needs
to
be
sipped
although
the
alcohol
is
for
the
most
part
well
masked
to
the
taste
smuttynose
smuttonator
is
a
big
beer
that
youd
actually
rather
chug
than
sip
it
has
great
flavour
but
an
even
more
appreciable
quaffability
sure
the
alcohol
plays
a
big
hand
but
its
a
helping
hand
that
furthers
the
beers
and
indeed
the
styles
nuanced
and
distinct
features
if
you
like
candleapple
sweetness
at
all
this
beer
is
worth
a
bite
chest
bump
nice
beer
but
not
the
strongest
in
this
series
the
color
was
somewhat
lighter
than
i
expected
from
a
double
bock
slightly
sweet
with
a
pleasant
funk
in
the
aromas
the
flavors
were
sufficiently
solid
to
stand
up
to
garlic
chicken
wings
and
would

aroma
is
rich

with
a

very
appetizing
it
pours
a

with

this

an

doppelbock

nearly
as
good
as

in

up
some

d
a

alcoholic
doppelbock
that
manages
nice
balance
otherwise
aside
from
being
a
biggerthannormal
doppelbock
this
is
fairly
paintbythenumbers
but
its
a
good
take
on
the
style
from
one
of
the
relatively
few
american
breweries
to
attempt
it
really
good
doppelbock
here
close
to
the
best
german
examples
just
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
presence
in
the
end
browsing
at
a
local
bottle
shop
and
i
eye
up
two
of
the
big
beers
from
smutty
nose
priced
very
modestly
this
and
the
baltic
porter
from
2009
were
only
six
bucks
i
was
sold
this
one
pours
an
impressive
deep
amber

clouded
with
some
yeast
sediment
nice
huge
collar
of
tan
khaki

goig
on
with
fine
intricate
layers
of

this
bottle
was
bottled
in
2010
probably
earlier
this
year
in
the
spring
aroma
has
some
big
malt
layers
deep
with
tart
fruit
and
hints
of
raisin
a
nice
depth
of
ingredients
involved
in
the
brewing
process
also
some
floral
fruity
notes
in
the
back
end
quite
the
interesting
new
england
brewed
german
style
lager
flavor
really
coats
the
palate
with

roasted

and
upfront
fruitiness
figsplumsraisins
soaked

with
a
nice
crusted

finishes
somewhat
balanced
with
a
strong
herbal
hop
finish
a
touch
of
dark
chocolate
and
other
roasted
malt
qualities
brings
a
nice
balance
to
the
overall
mix
as
it
warms
herbal
mint
with
a
touch
of
pine
cone
comes
out
the
hops
here
definitely
have
an
american
slant
but
theyre
note
overdone
mouthfeel
is
as
full
bodied
as
a
lager
will
ever
be
almost
chewy
due
to
loads
of
malts
and
bready
yeast
sediment
bringing
a
nice
body
carbonation
was
natural
bottle
conditioned
very
enjoyable
experience
drinkability
i
had
no
problems
finishing
and
enjoying
a
whole
bomber
although
ideally
you
better
find
a
drinking
partner
on
a
big
beer
like
this
great
quality
version
of
a
rarely
brewed
in
america
style
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
heavier
side
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
thought
it
was
a
good
beer
overall
with
some
great
flavors
to
it
very
nice
doppelbock
to
sip
on
this
evening
d
drinkability
for
me
is
pretty
low
a
bit
too
sweet
up
front
and
too
bitter
in
the
back
for
my
liking
becomes
a
bit
hard
to
drink
about
halfway
through
pours
a
hazy
mahogany
color
with
a
thick
and
frothy
tan
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
has
huge
malts
upfront
with
notes
of
treacle
caramel
toasted
bread
fig
and
plum
oak
and
vanilla
turbinado
sugar
alcohol
and
some
herbal
hops
the
flavor
is
also
very
malty
with
big
caramel
and
toffee
notes
along
with
turbinado
sugar
vanilla
oak
dark
fruits
plum
fig
cherry
along
with
some
herbal
hops
and
fusel
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
rich
and
drinkability
is
good
but
limited
by
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
a
very
solid
american
doppelbock
maybe
a
tad
sweet
but
still
complex
and
tasty
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
smoothness
to
the
drink
itself
the
boldness
of
the
taste
and
the
pop
of
the
aroma
we
were
a
bit
surprised
but
not
entirely
unpleased
by
the
enormity
of
how
apparent
the
alcohol
was
that
characteristic
alone
makes
this
stand
out
among
its
competitors
while
simultaneously
forcing
the
drinker
to
switch
to
something
a
bit
lighter
for
the
second
round
2010
bottle
poured
into
a
balloon
glass
fluffy
head
that
dissipates
with
molasses
and
dark
bread
in
the
nose
amber
in
color
taste
is
slightly
sweet
but
very
smooth
and
noncloying
not
nearly
as
thick
or
sweet
as
traditional
german
dopplebocks
ive
tried
celebrator
comes
to
mind
i
had
avoided
this
for
some
time
thinking
it
would
be
too
thick
and
heavy
but
this
is
a
very
refreshing
an
easytodrink
example
of
this
style
great
for
a
winters
night
by
the
fire
other
than
the
minor
style
flaws
a
wonderful
drinking
beer
with
tons
of
flavor
and
exceptional
character
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
more
please
warming
and
nourishing
is
the
feeling
i
get
from
this
beer
with
its
very
alcoholic
but
not
too
hot
character
and
strong
caramel
drizzled
fruit
flavor
it
has
a
good
variety
of
flavors
perhaps
not
as
complex
as
it
could
be
but
good
nonetheless
definitely
split
this
with
someone
or
plan
on
stretching
it
out
over
a
good
period
of
time
for
the
most
part
i
enjoy
the
big
beer
series
from
smuttynose
smuttonator
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
series
its
not
perfect
the
nose
could
use
a
little
work
and
perhaps
the
flavor
could
use
a
little
less
fruit
but
theres
no
shortage
of
flavor
if
you
ask
me
its
just
a
little
more
fruity
than
you
might
ordinarily
expect
from
a
doppelbock
bottom
line
im
still
enjoying
it
grab
a
bomber
quite
drinkable
especially
at
the
warmer
temp
that
i
allowed
it
to
reach
before
serving
it
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
2008
vintage
served
from
tap
into
a
shaker
poured
a
murky
brown
with
a
half
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
upon
sitting
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
grapes
and
bread
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
grapes
chocolate
and
alcohol
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
one
wasnt
that
great
for
me
i
was
truly
expecting
more
on
it
the
fruit
aspect
to
this
one
stole
the
show
for
sure
if
you
like
doppelbocks
you
might
like
this
one
but
i
dont
suggest
aging
it
at
all
d
a
good
sipper
from
smuttynose
not
my
favorite
big
beer
of
theirs
but
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
enough
carb
to
keep
it
from
being
real
sticky
or
cloying
its
a
warmer
but
drinks
pretty
well
in
spite
of
it
this
is
a
really
interesting
and
tasty
brew
as
long
as
you
dont
mind
an
insane
level
of
esters
esterbomb
fo
shizzle
definitely
a
sipper
dthis
is
a
very
drinkable
double
bock
so
many
of
the
dbs
ive
tasted
are
cloyingly
sweet
malt
bombs
and
drinking
the
entire
bottle
is
a
chore
this
went
down
very
pleasantly
and
i
can
easily
see
having
a
few
more
overall
i
like
this
glad
its
back
after
a
2
year
hiatus
i
will
cellar
a
few
bottles
to
see
how
this
one
ages
im
thinking
this
will
get
better
this
double
bock
pours
a
pretty
dull
red
with
a
small
head
that
sticks
around
there
is
tiny
bits
of
weak
lacing
the
smell
is
pure
malt
and
some
spicy
background
perhaps
the
yeast
or
some
spice
not
yet
clear
to
me
i
enjoy
bock
and
this
double
does
not
let
me
down
it
has
clean
smooth
flavor
that
only
hints
of
alcohol
and
some
nice
malty
aftertaste
the
mouth
feel
is
awesome
smooth
and
thick
yet
not
to
thick
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
beer
sampled
again

the
character
is
about
the
same
with
malt
introduction
and
then
a
slightly
boozy
finish
at
the
same
time
very
smooth
so
my
reaction
has
not
changed
so
much
although
i
felt
as
if
i
liked
it
better
this
time
taste
is
sweet
caramel
backed
by
bitter
chocolate
coffee
notes
carbonation
is
excellent
really
keeps
the
flavor
popping
really
good
drinkability
i
have
been
aging
this
one
two
years
and
it
has
paid
off
it
is
definitely
better
than
the
one
i
had
last
year
okay
smuttynose
you
may
be
on
to
something
here
the
carbonation
is
low
and
the
body
is
creamy
with
lingering
sweetness
and
some
raisin
notes
too
this
is
a
huge
beer
and
it
feels
great
in
my
mouth
the
booze
is
very
well
covered
but
not
invisible
if
this
was
an
11
it
would
be
expertly
masked
but
as
is
theres
enough
rewarding
flavor
to
make
this
above
average
in
drinkablity
another
nice
one
from
smutty
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
minor
head
that
dies
slow
and
left
lace
patches
down
the
glass
a
large
malt
aroma
mixing
in
bread
and
even
toffee
as
come
caramel
and
sugary
sweentess
good
malt
base
in
the
taste
as
well
as
this
brew
has
sticky
sweetness
with
the
abv
lending
itself
to
the
dry
breadroasted
malt
edge
caramel
toffee
and
something
akin
to
syrup
are
mixed
into
the
somewhat
heavy
body
for
sweetness
good
ripe
fruit
tastes
in
there
as
well
as
im
picking
up
something
like
pear
or
sour
grapecherry
comes
in
on
backend
and
works
for
balance
and
gives
a
illuminating
backbite
a
little
boozy
for
a
bomber
but
a
very
hearty
dopplebock
pretty
full
bodied
drinks
fairly
easy
though
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
no
prob
but
id
also
be
pretty
drunk
another
big
hit
from
the
big
beer
series
an
unbelievable
experience
arguably
the
best
smuttynose
has
offered
to
date
probably
a
bit
much
for
any
kind
of
everyday
drinking
everyday
beers
dont
need

is
very

so
id
say
its
pretty

in

well

the
beer
appears
a

love
smuttynose
beer
as
a
general
rule
my
lack
of
enthusiasm
for
this
one
probably
has
more
to
do
with
my
preference
for
roasted
malty
doppelbocks
than
it
does
for
any
failure
on
the
part
of
the
brewers
other
than
the
choice
of
ingredients
id
like
to
be
able
to
say
that
id
love

pleasurable
beer
for
sure
its
abundant
in
complexing
flavor
and
warmth
all
the
while
keeping
a
simple
ease
about
it
how
the
hell
they
do
it
i
dont
know
even
enjoyable
but
it
seems
to
be
lacking
a
richness
and
complexity
that
i
would
expect
in
a
great
doppelbock

poured

there

an

big

the

with

through

a
very

beer
with
a

overall
very
drinkable
in
my

and
another
good

from

id
like
to
see
a
litle
more

in
this

instead
of
some
of
the

that

quite
nice
was
able
to
pick
up
a
bomber
of
this
the
other
day
first
time
i
have
seen
it
the
brew
poured
to
a
deep
brown
color
with
red
like
tinge
to
it
it
had
a
fairly
robust
off
white
head
that
consisted
of
very
smallfine
bubbles
and
broke
down
quite
rapidly
the
lacing
from
this
brew
was
somewhat
limited
the
aromas
from
this
brew
seem
to
be
mostly
malts
with
highlights
of
caramel
and
roasted
scents
also
you
are
able
to
pick
up
a
strong
scent
of
alcohol
mixed
in
with
what
seems
to
be
dark
fruity
like
smells
it
is
a
nice
smelling
brew
though
the
alcohol
might
be
a
little
to
pronounced
the
flavors
of
this
brew
are
dominated
by
thick
almost
chewy
malt
feel
that
are
somewhat
sweet
reminds
me
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
has
an
alcohol
like
flavor
that
seems
to
be
spicy
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
not
able
to
pick
up
much
in
the
way
of
hops
over
all
this
is
a
good
brew
the
alcohol
seems
to
be
a
little
to
pronounced
for
my
tastes
i
like
this
beer
i
like

brewery

head
above
the
dark

frothy

lasts
excellently
with

left
sporadically
aroma
is
lots
of
heavy
malt
sweetness
with
alcohol
notes
apparent
taste
follows
the
aroma
but
the
alcohol
becomes
even
more
prominant
over
the
tongue
and
especially
in
the
aftertaste
almost
seems
the
grains
could
be
a
bit
more
hearty
here
but
thats
kind
of
nitpicking
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
great
for
the
style
with
the
drinkability
limited
somewhat
just
by
the
alcohol
presence
and
its
being
out
on
display
for
all
to
see
another
very
nice
offering
from
smutty
in
their
big
beer
series
thanks
to
ppoitras
for
sending
this
bomber
22
ounce
bottle
bottled
in
2004
on
label
thanks
to
goodbyeohio
for
sending
this
beer
my
way
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
tall
head
that
has
nice
retention
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
full
of
the
smells
it
should
be
dark
malts
chocolate
coffee
the
flavor
has
the
chocolate
and
roasted
character
as
well
but
the
alcohol
also
has
a
slight
presence
here
there
is
a
slight
raisiny
flavor
as
well
that
it
would
be
better
without
its
still
a
very
tasty
beer
and
i
wouldnt
pass
up
the
opportunity
to
have
it
again
thanks
to
goodbyeohio
and
clvand0
for
allowing
me
to
try
this
beer
it
pours
a
deep
ruby
with
brown
hues
the
head
is
billowing
and
about
3
fingers
high
but
falls
to
a
finger
over
the
beer
the
nose
is
roasty
and
nutty
i
dig
it
smells
right
to
me
the
flavor
is
slightly
raisiney
slighely
roasted
very
smooth
not
bad
at
all
maybe
a
touch
too
much
raisin
to
me
the
feel
is
nice
and
thick
minimal
carbonation
a
touch
creamy
overall
for
almost
being
10
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
think
i
could
enjoy
this
one
a
few
more
times
ill
be
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
smuttynose
another
excellent
beer
from
smuttynoses
big
beer
series
one
of
the
better
double
bocks
i
have
had
the
label
description
is
accurate
when
its
states
that
this
beer
has
a
deceptively
smooth
flavor
sorry
for
the
average
scores
but
i
gotta
review
em
as
i
drink
em
had
on
tap
at
the
barley
pub
in
dover
nh
my
overall
impression
of
this
one
was
of
sugar
medium
dark
amber
when
served
low
head
burnt
sugar
aroma
tastewise
was
more
of
the
same
there
were
notes
of
spun
sugar
to
start
and
the
finish
was
more
of
a
maple
sugar
flavor
poured
a
nice
light
brown
in
color
creamy
head
that
slowly
dissolved
to
form
a
thin
film
stubborn
spotchy
lace
the
aroma
is
mildly
caramel
the
flavor
is
sweet
but
nicely
balanced
with
the
hops
cream
and
caramel
also
come
through
in
the
flavor
only
can
slightly
taste
the
alcohol
not
sure
if
this
was
served
as
cold
as
it
should
have
been
may
have
been
slightly
crisper
if
it
was
served
appropriately
a
great
drinking
beer
not
overly
hoppy
to
destroy
the
taste
buds
but
has
great
flavor
and
balance
easy
to
enjoy
this
doppelbock
poured
a
deep
coppery
amber
color
with
tan
foam
that
settled
completely
flat
the
smell
was
very
modest
with
a
bit
of
malt
coming
through
the
taste
was
malty
with
light
sweetness
and
some
vinous
munich
malt
and
with
a
light
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
and
rich
with
mediumfull
body
and
moderate
carbonation
this
was
a
good
doppelbock
though
it
did
not
knock
my
socks
off
i
cant
say
this
was
a
favourite
brew
of
mine
but
i
also
cant
say
that
it
was
poorly
made
in
any
way
shape
or
form
there
is
good
stuff
going
on
here
all
around
its
just
not
necessarily
the
brew
for
me
i
couldwould
drink
this
one
again
but
it
might
be
a
while
before
that
happens
that
said
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
you
should
thoroughly
enjoy
this
brew
the
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
yet
rich
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
lots
of
crystal
malts
it
seems
sweet
and
very
warm
the
taste
is
good
also
it
has
a
warm
and
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
dry
and
sweet
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
brew
it
has
awesome
flavor
and
mouthfeel
a
fine
sessions
beer
the
flavor
profile
isnt
that
big
but
the
alcohol
does
kick
your
ass
in
the
end
some
age
may
do
this
beer
some
good
i
tried
this
on
tap
at
bones
and
dont
remember
the
alcohol
being
so
prominent
i
am
going
with
longstaff
suggestion
of
trying
to
age
this
big
boy
for
a
bit
overall
interesting
and
powerful
oh
and
im
not
sinking
this
one
ive
been
waiting
for
this
beer
to
become
available
since
i
first
saw
a
notice
of
it
on
the
smuttynose
website
it
poured
from
the
bottle
a
clear
mahogany
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
clingy
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
nose
has
a
great
carameltoffee
aroma
up
front
more
candy
notes
in
the
middle
of
the
aroma
and
just
a
hint
of
hop
fruit
on
the
finish
the
taste
is
a
lush
burst
of
malt
sweetness
rich
toffee
with
praline
and
dates
and
oddly
some
pepper
character
very
subtle
but
there
very
rich
smooth
mouth
feel
and
very
drinkable
i
love
this
beer
maltheads
rejoice
this
is
one
big
malty
brew
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
huge
head
that
stays
put
sweet
roasted
malts
perhaps
some
prunes
and
candied
sugar
nice
hoppy
bite
at
the
end
an
excellent
interpretation
of
the
style
not
as
smoothly
creamy
as
celebrator
my
all
time
favorite
dopplebock
but
its
now
my
favorite
usbrewed
dopplebock
however
i
have
not
been
able
to
lay
my
hands
on
any
thomas
hooker
liberator
yet
hmmmm
this
beer
a
whole
drinkablitly
highly
recommended
stuff
lots
of
malts
some
alcohol
along
with
some
doughy
banana
aromas
dark
cream
colored
head
transparent
dark
cola
colored
beer
with
a
caramel
hue
with
streams
of
slowly
rising
small
bubbles
soft
mouthfeel
on
this
fairly
thick
beer
big
malty
flavor
is
pretty
sweet
and
alcoholic
and
accompanied
by
some
doughy
yeastiness
bitterness
kicks
in
midway
and
takes
the
alcohol
with
it
into
the
finish
i
like
this
beer
its
big
and
tasty
and
while
i
know
its
party
of
the
big
beer
series
it
seems
like
its
just
a
little
too
big
especially
with
the
bitterness
poured
with
a
tan
thick
pillowy
head
witha
deep
amber
color
with
some
excellent
clarity
syrup
sugary
aroma
very
subtle
and
balanced
with
some
alcohol
thick
sweet
malty
mouthfeel
with
a
spicy
warming
alcohol
very
warming
and
spicy
with
a
slight
smokey
afterataste
and
a
hot
finish
took
a
bit
to
get
through
a
bomber
but
thats
what
there
made
for
sippin
good
stuff
the
bottled
version
poured
out
into
my
5
liter
mug
with
a
huge
creamy
caramel
colored
head
hot
alcohol
aromas
dominate
the
nose
creamy
mouthfeel
is
quite
appropriate
and
there
is
a
nice
raisin
dark
chocolate
and
plum
flavor
but
the
hot
alcohol
aromas
and
flavors
seem
to
overide
everything
else
now
i
can
see
why
they
delayed
to
release
of
this
beer
hoping
the
hotness
subsides
its
something
i
am
noticing
in
many
of
their
big
beer
series
lately
maybe
they
are
too
big
i
will
buy
a
few
bottles
and
let
them
sit
for
a
few
months
hopefully
it
mellows
by
the
time
the
traditional
dopplebock
season
rolls
around
nevertheless
a
fine
fine
dopplebock
but
do
not
be
mistaken
this
is
intense
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
still
smuttonator
is
a
damn
fine
brew
i
was
absolutely
blown
away
by
this
firstly
i
have
never
seen
head
retention
like
this
beer
boasts
its
been
in
my
glass
for
over
an
hour
and
theres
still
a
measurable
head
the
taste
and
smell
remind
me
of
celebrator
the
yardstick
by
which
double
bocks
will
be
measured
but
just
seems
to
do
so
much
more
viciously
smooth
with
a
velvety
mouthfeel
that
leaves
very
little
to
be
desired
near
perfection
i
will
have
to
try
this
next
to
a
celebrator
one
day
to
determine
which
is
the
true
yardstick
dark
amber
cloudy
with
what
looks
like
unexpected
yeast
particles
floating
around
tan
head
leaving
thick
sticky
lacing
rich
nose
of
malt
bourbon
and
alcohol
this
is
a
full
bodied
flavorful
strong
sipper
it
feels
all
of
its
9
nice
thick
and
smooth
mouthfeel
notes
of
rum
raisins
vanilla

smells

tastes
the
same
a
little
unbalanced
on
the
alcohol
front
but
it
blends
nice
enough
after
the
initial
startling
few
sips
other
big
beer
series
beers
are
better
but
smutty
never
let
ya
down
somewhat
heavier
in
the
muth
feel
then
you
might
expect
probably
due
to
the
alcohol
still
drinable
despite
the
alcohol
taste
because
as
it
warms
the
taste
blends
better
over
all
this
double
bock
ranks
very
well
among
bocks

grainish
aroma
the
taste
has
a
sharp
malt
bite
to
it
grianish
a
bit
hard
to
drink
overall
its
the
worst
its
a
tad
hard
to
drink
grainy
i
love
this
beer
my
favorite
doppelbock
i
dont
drink
those
new
jack
beers
that
taste
like
my
dad
made
it
at
home
unless
im
drinking
his
had
this
in
a
bottle
at
watkins
drinkery
in
philly
and
was
seriously
disappointed
excellent
beer
not
quite
as
good
as
ayinger
celebrator
but
veryvery
good
cant
say
enough
about
this
beer
truly
truly
excellent
all
the
way
overall
and
excellent
example
of
a
doppelbock
distinct
flavors
and
easy
drinking
make
this
an
ideal
introductory
doppelbock

and
drank
over
1530
minutes

time

bottle
of
optimator
bock
drank
love
this
beer
it
sets
the
standards
for
everything
i
personally
love
about
beers
truly
a
great
beer
imo
o
not
a
bad
doppelbock
will
have
to
try
more
to
compare
nice
and
dark
with
a
little
bite
comparing
this
to
paulaners
version
i
find
this
one
harder
to
drink
not
as
smooth
a
fine
brew
indeed
tastes
a
bit
like
a
dark
octoberfest
i
really
like
this
beer
almost
like
a
liquid
dessert
oloved
the
flavor
not
great
but
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
o
its
an
okay
beer
not
a
go
to
beer
but
one
that
i
would
have
on
occasion
this
is
my
favorite
beer
it
made
me
explore
the
world
of
craft
beer
v
a
little
pricy
but
definitely
worth
it
best
beer
on
the
planet
havent
had
one
in
a
while
to
review
it
in
great
detail
i
just
remember
it
tasting
like
awesome
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
its
not
celebrator
but
its
very
drinkable
o
some
very
nice
layering
of
aromas
and
flavor
with
nothing
jumping
out
but
everything
melding
into
a
highly
drinkable
higher
alcoholbrew
this
one
could
sneak
up
on
you
a
wellmade
beer
tasty
smooth
not
the
depth
of
flavor
or
the
rich
thick
body
of
others
had
bottle
unseen
at
a
restaurant
not
known
for
its
beer
offerings
so
maybe
not
tasting
it
at
its
best
sorry
to
see
the
bottom
of
my
glass
more
please
pair
with
sweet
rich
foods
ideally
i
would
drink
it
with
a
dessert
that
features
real
dark
chocolate
the
cherry
tones
also
lend
itself
to
pairing
with
dishes
that
have
actual
cherries
like
a
cheesecake
that
has
some
but
it
also
works
well
with
an
entree
that
has
barbecue
sauce
it
is
a
good
beer
lucky
to
have
discovered
a
new
store
in
my
area
which
seems
to
be
the
only
place
that
carries
this
beer
pretty
creamy
feel
sweet
aromas
and
flavors
hint
of
licorice
coffee
black
cherry
grape
an
oily
quality
overall
4
07
the
other
two
bottles
i
bought
will
no
doubt
be
in
my
fridge
for
a
long
time
this
beer
is
so
strong
i
dont
think
ill
crave
or
want
one
for
another
three
days
the
flavor
is
however
on
purpose
and
in
your
face
oaty
hoppy
licorice
flavor
that
stays
with
you
this
beer
is
a
punch
to
the
face
light
fruit
high
carbonation
light
flavor
good
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
in
color
with
a
good
1finger
creamy
foamy
head
that
settles
down
to
just
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
after
a
while
the
lacing
is
close
to
ringlike
at
first
then
near
the
the
of
the
drink
is
very
spotty
the
aroma
is
very
nice
of
dark
fruit
sweetness
and
malts
for
the
most
part
more
going
on
with
the
taste
as
the
plums
and
dates
add
great
flavor
to
this
wonderful
brew
medium
bodied
with
perfect
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
with
no
bitter
finish
at
all
a
great
brew
prost
has
some
great
dark
fruity
notes
than
other
malt
heavy
doppelbocks
lack
sweet
fairly
full
mouth
and
a
good
bit
of
carb
definitely
malt
heavy
but
the
tastes
of
dates
and
plums
really
help
balance
this
out
and
make
it
more
complex
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
ive
had
from
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
loved
it
it
has
a
strong
dark
malty
flavor
slightly
touched
by
hops
and
a
heavy
body
it
seems
only
available
very
seasonably
in
wi
and
i
make
the
most
of
its
fall
and
winter
availability
malty
and
rich
sweet
and
creamy
its
a
treat

not
as
rich
and
complex
as
i
was
hoping
but
certainly
very
good
the
dry
sticky
impression
is
a
bit
distracting
the
flavor
seems
to
be
tipped
in
favor
of
the
bitter
fruity
qualities
nice
go
to
beer
year
round
dark
a
bit
sour
on
the
tongue
and
not
too
thick
low
carbonation
and
a
high
alcohol
content
make
for
a
beer
that
will
give
you
a
nice
buzz
before
filling
you
up
a
weirder
doppelbock
highs
and
lows
so
it
falls
somewhere
in
between
really
liked
this
one
wouldnt
hesitate
to
try
it
again
later
o
extremely
enjoyable
if
your
in
the
mood
for
a
dark
beer
does
well
on
the
palate
and
the
mouth
a
solid
doppelbock
tons
of
flavor
pretty
drinkable
but
a
little
boozy
a
yummy
dark
beer
tasty
looks
great
just
a
great
beer
all
around
highly
recommended
if
youre
into
dark
beers
its
not
too
dark
its
just
right
i
picked
it
up
as
a
single
bottle
but
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
dark
beer
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
up
more
than
just
the
single
o
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
in
this
beer
but
you
can
almost
subtly
taste
it
as
the
beer
warms
up
enjoyable
but
rich
enough
in
flavor
and
aroma
tat
i
would
likely
not
be
able
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
overall
this
beer
drinks
like
a
meal
filling
had
mine
on
the
way
home
from
work
in
a
16oz
bottle
poured
a
deep
and
clear
brown
the
white
head
is
fizzier
but
doesnt
last
long
the
aroma
is
definitely
malty
with
dark
bread
and
a
sweetness
reminiscent
of
raisins
the
taste
is
similar
but
theres
a
nice
roasted
earthy
funkiness
in
the
background
the
body
is
just
right
with
a
silky
feel
and
finish
this
is
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
doppelbock
would
probably
reserve
this
for
the
fallwinter
months
an
inexpensive
malty
beer
with
a
bit
of
a
kick
could
imagine
sipping
this
around
a
camp
fire
a
reasonable
price
point
for
this
beer
would
be
2
to
2
50
per
bottle
o
the
taste
is
pretty
good
once
i
get
over
the
skunked
smell
it
actually
becomes
enjoyable
overall
i
was
pretty
disappointed
ive
had
this
on
tap
at
a
local
german
restaurant
and
have
enjoyed
it
this
bottled
version
though
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
its
not
bad
its
just
not
particularly
good
pours
with
a
beige
head
very
dark
amberbrown
with
medium
carbonation
leaves
little
lacing
as
head
weakens
quickly
aroma
of
hops
toffee
caramel
taste
of
malty
grain
syrup
some
toffee
toasted
oats
mouthfeel
is
milky
finish
of
malt
richness
with
a
little
hop
bitterness
nice
but
a
bit
dull
now
im
confused
what
a
dopplebock
is
supposed
to
be
like
since
this
came
straight
from
germany
now
my
impression
of
dopplebocks
are
that
they
arent
that
strong
in
flavor
but
they
are
in
alcohol
content
this
is
the
country
that
made
the
dopplebock
i
guess
ill
have
to
try
more
to
find
out
if
this
is
a
fluke
overall
pretty
good
glad
to
have
tried
it
fits
in
with
the
classic
doppelbocks
in
style
nicely
sort
of
an
easier
drinking
lighter
one
if
i
could
say
that
an
oldie
but
goodie
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
not
as
many
caramel
flavors
as
other
doppels
but
thats
ok
since
the
spicy
flavors
are
prominent
and
very
appealing
the
mouth
is
medium
perhaps
a
bit
lighter
than
most
in
this
style
but
it
seems
to
go
well
with
the
spicy
and
almost
dry
finish
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
does
not
lose
anything
as
you
drink
it
almost
comes
across
as
a
session
doppelbock
in
its
drinkability
worth
grabbing
one
o
weaker
4
overall
and
barely
but
ill
give
it
one
because
it
is
still
a
solid
doppelbock
just
not
my
doppelbock
of
choice
especially
with
a
few
better
ones
out
there
the
price
on
this
one
is
good
and
it
is
readily
available
at
most
places
yearround
which
is
a
bonus
mouthfeel
is
dry
smooth
unfortunately
a
bit
flat
overall
not
bad
better
than
i
remembered
its
been
years
and
years
since
i
had
this
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
almost
brown
with
a
good
head
and
lacing
the
nose
is
dark
fruit
plums
raisins
caramel
and
toffee
against
a
sweet
biscuit
background
as
it
warms
prunes
are
at
the
forefront
full
medium
body
with
a
nice
smooth
texture
that
approaches
slick
the
carbonation
level
is
low
normal
the
flavor
profile
is
complex
and
well
balanced
it
begins
with
dark
fruit
progresses
to
toffeecaramel
and
ends
with
a
rich
toasty
sweetness
the
finish
is
smooth
with
a
nice
burst
of
sweetness
and
a
slight
tingle
of
alcohol
at
the
back
of
the
throat
an
outstanding
doppelbock
o
my
favorite
dopplebock
by
far
and
ive
tried
many
german
and
most
american
versions
that
being
said
i
like
the
carmel
sweet
bread
like
finish
personally
this
is
a
fridge
beerlet
it
warm
before
drinking
of
course
for
me
easy
to
drink
high
alcohol
per
volume
but
you
would
never
know
it
overall
awesome
doppelbock
doesnt
get
any
better
than
from
a
german
brewery
definitely
having
a
few
more
tonight
a
staple
beer
at
a
great
price
point
try
it
overall
a
good
doppelbock
not
great
easy
drinking
i
would
drink
again
but
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
overall
spaten
really
did
a
great
job
with
this
beer
price
point
is
right
on
at
15
99
usd
for
a
12pack
that
really
hides
a
high
abv
compared
to
most
other
beers
this
doppelbock
is
fantastic
in
the
middle
of
winter
thanks
to
the
warming
alcohol
content
but
refreshing
enough
to
be
drank
on
the
hottest
days
of
summer
when
in
doubt
in
my
local
beer
store
i
always
turn
to
spatens
optimator
gave
it
a
europour
right
down
the
middle
of
the
glass
built
a
tall
beige
head
real
rich
brown
color
less
than
average
lace
after
sipping
aroma
was
that
sweet
malty
smell
youd
expect
from
a
doppel
flavor
was
the
same
definitely
sweet
no
bitter
hop
flavor
plum
or
raisin
notes
maybe
i
could
barely
pick
up
the
higher
alcohol
content
carbonation
was
less
than
average
and
mouthfeel
was
decent
the
viscosity
was
medium
and
not
a
long
aftertaste
this
is
a
classic
version
of
the
style
shouldnt
disappoint
most
that
are
looking
to
sample
a
decent
doppelbock
o
a
fine
quality
and
tasty
dopplebock
although
the
prune
flavor
eventually
becomes
a
bit
cloying
o
i
like
this
beer
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
with
the
higher
finishing
gravity
associated
with
a
doppelbock
that
is
to
be
expected
i
would
like
to
see
a
little
more
bitterness
or
a
bit
more
attenuation
to
balance
the
sweetness
and
dry
it
out
just
a
tiny
bit
otherwise
its
a
well
done
brew
overall
very
pleasant
beer
allaround
for
all
you
seasonal
beerdrinkers
out
there
this
might
not
be
your
first
choice
while
lounging
at
the
beach
or
by
the
pool
but
you
cant
beat
sitting
by
the
fire
with
a
glass
of
this
stuff
in
hand
on
a
crisp
autumn
day
the
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
are
this
beers
strong
points
if
were
looking
at
it
from
an
overall
experience
standpoint
with
its
roasty
caramel
notes
finished
up
by
its
sweet
breadiness
this
beer
is
one
of
the
smoother
dark
beers
out
there
manifestation
it
manifested
like
nothing
its
flat
not
complexed
and
finished
as
it
started
basic
with
slight
hop
i
pour
it
down
the
drain
looked
pretty
brown
kinda
frothy
not
like
the
nigeria
but
like
irish
creme
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
so
much
so
that
later
that
night
i
ordered
another
one
they
were
4
a
pop
try
it
overall
quite
tasty
i
have
had
this
over
20
times
and
i
never
get
tired
of
it
overall
a
nice
doppelbock
but
it
seems
to
have
a
slight
skunky
flavor
to
it
it
might
be
the
green
bottle
playing
tricks
on
my
mind
pretty
solid
offering
beautiful
garnet
hue
dark
and
clear
quickly
fading
head
but
persistent
carbonation
slim
lacing
aroma
is
bready
with
toasty
sweet
caramelization
and
dark
fruits
taste
is
full
and
follows
aroma
with
good
roast
and
nuances
of
earth
and
spice
very
smooth
very
malty
simple
but
pleasant
definitely
worth
having
especially
given
its
availability
and
cost
just
a
note
that
i
have
tried
several
other
doppelbocks
and
this
one
remains
my
favorite
including
the
much
celebtrated
cebrator
great
o
im
generally
a
fan
of
thicker
and
heavier
doppelbocks
ayinger
immediately
comes
to
mind
and
this
one
fits
that
description
holds
up
well
with
age
and
is
under
9
for
a
6pack
so
its
definitely
well
worth
a
buy
overall
an
excellent
beer
overall
its
a
heavier
beer
but
not
so
heavy
that
you
can
only
drink
one
its
going
to
be
added
to
my
regular
rotation
o
very
very
good
doppelbock
not
great
missing
a
little
something
in
the
flavor
that
i
cannot
pinpoint
it
has
several
of
the
hints
of
taste
that
i
like
about
the
style
but
leaves
a
slightly
bland
aftertaste
however
overall
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
but
ive
only
had
a
couple
of
dopplebocks
so
maybe
ill
appreciate
it
more
when
ive
expanded
my
pallet
a
bit
prefer
something
with
a
lower
abv
and
less
sourbitter
notes
again
possible
this
particular
beer
was
skunked
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
has
pleasant
flavours
and
is
kind
to
the
wallet
while
being
generous
yet
discreet
with
its
abv
dont
expect
too
much
and
youll
enjoy
this
brew
i
would
consider
this
as
a
good
couch
sitting
beer
the
taste
has
some
malty
presence
with
some
moderately
toasted
munich
and
caramel
malt
sweetness
with
some
nutty
flavor
with
creaminess
from
the
yeast
the
flavor
is
more
sweet
than
anything
with
gentle
spice
in
the
background
overall
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
bock
not
too
strong
but
still
might
not
have
multiples
since
it
is
on
the
sweet
side
not
a
very
complex
beer
but
fits
the
style
well
enough
cant
say
ive
ever
had
a
better
doppelbock
watch
out
for
that
sneaky
7
6
started
out
with
some
sweet
maltiness
finshed
with
some
acedic
hoppiness
while
the
7
6
abv
creates
a
warming
effect
once
again
the
doppel
bock
comes
thru
tired
of
watery
and
hoppy
taps
at
the
local
steak
house
i
ordered
a
doppel
bock
it
might
have
been
the
fantastic
food
and
company
that
set
off
the
evening
but
it
was
the
beer
that
made
the
night
spectacular
this
is
great
doppelbock
that
i
highly
recommend
o
good
probably
my
favorite
spaten
product
o
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
aftertase
is
a
little
too
fresh
grain
almost
corn
or
vegetable
like
not
bad
at
all
but
it
might
lack
some
complexity
that
i
want
in
a
doppelbock
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
melanoidin
notes
open
as
it
warms
the
fruitiness
is
a
touch
overpowering
regarding
the
malt
profile
wish
the
flavor
matched
the
nose
more
exactly
o
solid
doppelbock
surprising
light
for
a

abv
brew
o
a
damn
good
doppelbock
plenty
of
taste
not
so
heavy
that
you
cant
drink
a
few
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
any
bock
fans
or
anyone
who
enjoys
dark
lagers
in
general
overall
a
fairly
standard
doppelbock
thats
very
drinkable
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
this
beer
is
available
everywhere
and
its
worth
picking
up
if
you
enjoy
doppelbocks
pleasing
malty
and
sweet
aroma
minimal
carbination
and
head
taste
was
good
strong
malt
sweet
caramel
and
maybe
a
trace
of
chocolate
long
finish
with
some
alcohol
to
me
my
first
experience
with
a
dopplebock
looking
forward
to
comparing
to
other
dark
lagers
and
ales
to
pick
a
group
of
favorites
at
this
point
this
may
be
a
little
on
the
too
sweet
side
for
me
but
still
enjoyed
the
beer
and
especially
the
smell
agree
with
other
comments
about
the
green
bottle
why
put
a
good
beer
in
a
clear
or
green
bottle
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
classic
german
beers
this
is
a
very
decent
full
bodied
flavorful
reddish
amber
beer
with
a
good
sweet
roasted
grain
smell
a
roasted
malt
flavor
with
some
hops
in
the
aftertaste
has
a
fair
amount
of
head
to
it
that
dissipates
almost
immediately
some
toasted
grains
on
the
aftertaste
so
a
little
bitterness
as
the
aftertaste
with
a
hint
of
some
grapefruit
a
dry
finish
which
would
go
good
with
any
good
meal
overall
like
i
said
if
it
said
it
was
a
maibock
id
probably
enjoy
it
but
i
was
let
down
not
a
terrible
beer
just
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
surprisingly
good
maybe
a
tad
too
sweet
not
a
trace
of
the
7
6
and
the
price
is
right
winner
overall
i
cant
help
but
think
this
must
be
great
on
tap
why
do
german
brewers
use
green
bottles
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
in
my
book
why
they
risk
putting
it
in
a
green
bottle
i
have
no
clue
it
may
be
too
sweet
for
some
but
that
is
the
style
i
like
it
a
lot
and
if
i
were
to
detract
any
points
it
would
be
for
the
very
faint
head
i
give
it
a
solid
4
out
of
5
maybe
one
notch
higher
i
am
not
happy
about
the
ownership
of
the
brewery
and
that
destroys
any
chance
of
me
buying
it
again

balanced
well
with
the
hops
also
you
really
cant
taste
the
hop
character
to
much
bocks
seem
to
have
a
sweeter
quality
then
a
porter
which
i
would
probably
get
confused
during
a
blind
folded
taste
test
and
this
one
works
it
well
that
way
the
verdict
not
bad
its
nowhere
near
the
best
doppelbock
ive
had
but
i
enjoyed
it
plenty
of
chocolaty
goodness
this
would
pair
perfectly
with
a
chunk
of
gourmet
cheese
a
true
classic
a
good
example
of
a
dopplebock
but
one
that
seems
like
it
might
have
been
great
in
the
past
but
has
been
neutered
now
o
great
try
this
one

very

well
balanced

the
ale

and
earthy

nice
example
of
the
style
not
outstanding
but
it
is
worth
a
shot
wow
i
forgot
i
had
this
in
my
fridge
and
i
forgot
what
it
tasted
like
too
bad
i
just
opened
this
up
and
it
all
came
back
delicious
thick
refreshing
and
now
that
ive
finished
the
one
bottle
at

abv
im
a
little
buzzed
too
definitely
remembering
to
buy
more
o
while
i
have
to
knock
off
some
merits
for
the
green
bottle
this
is
a
remarkably
good
brew
from
a
macro
brewery
that
needs
to
be
shipped
across
the
ocean
to
reach
me
im
glad
to
see
one
of
my
gateway
beers
actually
tastes
better
now
that
im

knowledgable

very
nice

rich
a

treat
this
may
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
alcohol
content
with
flavor
that
isnt
like
drinking
a
mudmeal
spaten
optimator
is
a
dark
brown
malt
beer
with
hints
of
red
fullbodied
nutty
taste
a
strong
malt
taste
very
low
in
hops
this
beer
also
has
a
hint
of
caramel
the
overall
aftertaste
is
strong
but
not
bitter
and
definitely
not
fruity
very
affordable
especially
if
you
want
a
beer
with
a
strong
taste
opinion
coming
back
to
this
for
the
first
time
in
years
its
not
what
i
expected
nor
recall
but
its
got
all
the
technicallycorrect
nuances
of
a
model
doppelbock
drinkable
in
quantity
despite
the
finish
being
a
lil
too
hot
and
floral
leads
me
to
think
the
ferment
was
rushed
or
something
this
example
speaks
to
me
as
a
regular
traditional
bock
with
the
presence
of
additional
alcohol
maybe
they
just
brewed
a
regular
bock
and
added
extra
ethanol
dont
know
why
anybody
would
do
that
though
overall
very
nice
beer
wouldnt
sit
down
and
drink
two
or
three
in
a
row
but
would
definitely
purchase
this
again
and
recommend
warms
up
an
empty
stomach
o
nice
well
rounded
doppelbock
that
improves
once
warmed
i
really
want
to
try
this
on
tap
overall
has
always
been
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
all
time
kind
of
like
coming
home
again
ya
know
love
the
style
love
the
brewery
even
if
it
is
very
commercial
love
the
beer
this
is
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
a
good
german
brew
not
bitter
not
tart
if
anything
guilty
of
being
sweeter
than
most
might
prefer
but
i
like
my
sweets
i
thought
twice
about
the
three
5s
and
this
is
my
first
beer
of
the
evening
afternoon
so
im
not
yet
buzzed
i
love
this
beer
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
small
offwhite
head
smell
is
a
bit
nutty
with
caramel
dark
fruit
and
sweet
malts
actually
quite
nice
smells
a
bit
quadlike
flavor
has
a
lot
of
the
same
characteristics
as
the
nose
but
it
doesnt
all
come
together
quite
as
well
as
i
wouldve
liked
the
flavors
all
come
together
nicely
on
the
front
end
but
it
gets
this
strange
bitteralcohol
thing
on
the
finish
which
lingers
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
but
a
little
on
the
thin
side
for
the
style
could
use
a
little
more
heft
overall
this
is
a
decent
doppelbock
but
not
a
great
one
i
wish
the
flavors
came
together
a
little
better
but
its
certainly
drinkable
not
perfect
but
likable
and
i
think
deserving
of
a
better
score
than
i
see
here
on
this
site
i
do
suspect
this
beer
might
be
noticeably
improved
on
draft
where
with
luck
and
hope
the
flavors
would
be
brought
forward
more
overallthis
beer
is
good
for
a
chilly
autumn
evening
it
is
not
sessionable
in
my
book
but
it
is
good
if
you
want
a
dark
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
maltymolasses
brew
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
this
brews
for
you
c
overall
good
for
such
a
mass
produced
beer
feel
like
it
has
done
some
good
mellowing
out
in
the
year
and
a
half
since
it
was
bottled
needs
more
character
o
great
looking
beer
but
lacked
some
malt
aromas
i
expect
the
taste
of
the
malt
seemed
to
be
onedimensional
the
same
taste
throughout
o
very
good
doppelbock
just
a
pleasure
to
drink
its
different
too
which
is
nice
the
malt
play
a
very
unique
roll
that
is
not
overwhelming
as
in
many
others
but
is
still
commanding
im
only
giving
the
overall
a
4
because
i
hesitate
to
give
this
beer
a
4
5
it
is
so
so
good
but
90
and
above
is
reserved
for
royalty
m
medium
body
low
carbonation
o
all
the
rich
character
of
a
fortified
wine
like
port
that
gets
bolder
as
it
warms
sweet
and
filling
a
bread
of
a
beer
a
very
enjoyable
glass
from
start
to
finish
odflavor
trumps
all
and
here
the
flavor
was
the
highlight
of
the
beer
i
enjoyed
this
brew
more
and
more
after
every
sip
my
final
verdict
its
no
hooker
liberator
and
it
surely
aint
no
celebrator
but
its
a
nice
import
doppelbock
a
single
12
oz
is
enough
for
me
oh
and
btw
thanks
for
the
comfy
buzz
maybe
ill
have
another
come
thanksgiving
m
tinglier
than
the
flat
body
would
suggest
with
a
pleasant
amount
of
heat
overalla
very
enjoyable
lager
i
would
place
it
half
way
between
bock
and
doppelbock
i
like
this
beer
o
this
one
packs
a
malty
punch
now
i
know
why
they
call
this
breakfast
in
a
glass
pretty
interesting
concept
i
like
it
but
definitely
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
o
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
its
seems
easy
to
order
a
follow
up
or
two
the
high
abv
lets
the
beer
buzz
catch
up
pretty
fast
this
was
served
in
a
0
5
liter
spaten
branded
glass
i
love
the
brown
almost
bloodred
color
of
this
one
when
its
poured
into
a
glass
the
malts
are
extremely
prominent
rich
and
toasty
with
caramel
and
molasses
overtones
and
a
hint
of
dark
brown
bread
on
the
finish
a
moderate
carbonation
level
doesnt
quite
eclipse
the
dash
of
bitter
that
sets
off
the
malty
sweetness
very
nicely
its
very
very
assertive
but
not
cloying
in
terms
of
sweetness
a
hearty
solid
germanstyle
beer
a
little
too
strong
for
a
session
beer
but
a
couple
of
em
will
weigh
you
down
very
nicely

a
definite
buy
again
overall
a
good
doppelbock
from

not
quite
on
the
level
of
ayinger

but
it
might
be
more
session
friendly
poured
a
transparent
black
with
a
one
finger
head
looks
like
a
glass
of
pepsi
the
smell
is
of
dark
cherries
cranberry
fig
newtons
and
blueberries
alright
i
guess
though
i
prefer
nothing
but
the
blueberries
the
taste
follows
the
smell
except
the
cherry
flavoring
comes
through
a
wee
bit
more
the
mouthfeel
matches
both
of
the
previous
and
nothing
else
comes
through
the
beer
was
a
large
disappointment
considering
how
highly
my
father
and
brother
had
talked
about
it
o
somewhat
disappointing
to
be
honest
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
would
pick
something
else
as
far
as
the
taste
goes
im
definitely
tasting
toffee
plums
and
a
hint
of
wheat
its
certainly
the
kind
of
beer
i
would
recommend
to
someone
who
likes
dark
german
beer
but
doesnt
care
for
becks
doppels
arent
everyones
cup
of
tea
or
uh
beer
sweet
malty
the
polar
opposite
of
an
ipa
but
if
you
want
a
good
strongish
clean
german
lager
its
hard
to
beat
this
overall
i
was
expecting
more
from
optimator
in
terms
of
flavor
and
smell
had
the
aftertaste
not
been
so
dry
and
ashy
i
wouldve
been
more
impressed
db
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
i
rather
enjoyed
this
one
pleasant
experience
from
start
to
finish
despite
my
not
liking
lagers
i
could
get
used
to
this
one
a
bit
thin
for
me
but
overall
a
good
beer
this
is
a
pretty
good
doppelbock
and
it
comes
at
an
affordable
price
final
thought
2
a
pop
and
a
very
nice
7
abv
give
this
one
a
ride
d
this
was
a
nice
doppelbock
with
a
basic
but
enjoyable
scent
and
taste
the
body
was
solid
and
the
finish
was
smooth
so
it
was
definitely
easy
to
drink
nothing
special
about
this
but
a
classic
quality
brew
overall
impression
could
be
worse
but
im
not
particularly
impressed
with
this
one
a
pretty
decent
doppelbock
nice
and
sweet
and
balanced
mostly
with
a
deftly
integrated
elevated
abv
i
would
recommend
this
especially
if
the
weather
wasnt
so
well
tropical
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
the
flavor
is
solid
but
the
bitter
finish
doesnt
mesh
well
with
the
rest
of
the
profile
the
nose
is
also
pretty
decent
but
it
has
that
traditional
euro
musty
note
overall
its
definitely
worth
checking
out
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
a
little
less
spicey
than
i
like
for
the
style
still
a
good
beer
to
have
routinely
overall
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
with
a
high
abv
the
abv
is
hidden
slightly
but
the
taste
and
nose
definitely
contain
some
alcohol
not
the
best
dopplebock
ive
ever
had
but
is
reasonably
easy
to
find
very
nice
worth
trying
o
overall
very
enjoyable
not
what
i
was
anticipating
it
was
much
more
enjoyable
then
other
spaten
brews
is
there
better
versions
of
this
style
yes
but
i
have
always
enjoyed
any
brew
from
spaten
and
this
classic
brand
of
doppelbock
is
no
different
a
light
khaki
head
with
a
dark
ice
tea
color
brew
spots
of
lace
here
and
there
and
nice
retention
smell
is
caramel
and
toffee
with
buttery
notes
lots
of
toasted
grains
with
a
light
roasted
coffee
taste
follows
suit
with
molasses
and
warm
brown
toast
very
nice
roasted
grain
malt
body
sweet
caramel
as
well
hops
are
dry
and
nicely
bitter
with
a
light
herbal
flourish
in
the
crisp
finish
a
touch
of
leafy
oiliness
lingers
stretching
it
out
a
bit
feel
is
a
bit
light
but
nicely
weighted
with
a
decent
amount
of
heft
and
a
smooth
light
creaminess
in
the
back
of
the
overall
crisp
feel
a
nice
lenten
beer
and
a
good
version
of
the
style
recommendation
not
hard
to
drink
easy
to
enjoy
and
appreciate
have
one
or
have
six
at
7
25
vol
its
easy
to
enjoy
in
a
bottle
or
on
tap
othis
is
one
of
the
least
drinkable
german
beers
that
ive
had
something
about
it
doesnt
sir
right
with
me
its
fairly
harsh
and
seems
to
be
very
off
balanced
i
think
the
molasses
syrupy
taste
to
it
is
just
too
much
o
i
love
optimator
great
year
round
beer
tasty
full
of
flavor
reasonably
priced
and
always
available
dark
brown
in
color
with
deep
red
hues
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
is
a
thick
light
brown
foam
with
a
frothiness
to
it
retention
is
excellent
and
lacing
is
decent
the
nose
is
very
sweet
lots
of
light
toasted
malts
maple
syrup
caramel
and
brown
sugar
in
the
aroma
still
there
is
an
upfront
brown
sugar
sweetness
only
this
time
with
a
more
pronounced
toasted
grain
character
hops
balance
through
the
middle
and
take
it
to
a
bittersweet
finish
full
bodied
and
soft
on
the
palate
carbonation
is
done
right
and
feels
refined
extremely
tasty
affordable
and
available
this
one
is
worthy
o
pretty
av
erage
brew
doesnt
make
you
say
wow
more
like
eh
not
bad
so
it
gets
an
eh
not
bad

overall
i
tried
this
beer
at
a
german
pub
in
south
carolina
and
i
thought
it
was
great
i
had
two
16oz
glassesthe
smell
was
nice
with
a
variety
of
aromas
pretty
typical
for
the
style
a
touch
of
molasses
and
a
lot
of
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
delicious
and
addicting
a
fantastic
doppelbock
im
definitely
going
back
for
some
more
really
good
one
not
my
favorite
overall
but
nails
the
classic
flavors
in
a
good
basic
way
not
super
complex
definitely
recommend
over
most
attempts
this
is
a
solid
doppelbock
with
all
of
the
attributes
typical
to
the
style
malty
with
toasted
caramel
and
bready
aspects
this
is
worth
a
try
and
i
bet
it
would
be
good
with
food
the
first
traditional
doppelbock
i
ever
tasted
back
in
the
day
i
mean
i
loved
it
then
and
its
still
pretty
decent
now
prefer
other
germans
to
this
one
and
even
a
few
american
examples
still
a
good
beer
and
cheap
3
5
overall
a
pretty
basic
doppelbock
with
a
slightly
bland
flavor
overall
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
doppelbock
and
for
the
15
a
case
the
local
store
was
selling
it
for
who
can
complain
its
a
delicious
beer
i
picked
up
a
sixpack
for
the
night
from
the
local
southampton
the
beer
store
for
12
and
expected
nothing
big
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
a
nuanced
yet
familiar
doppelbock
taste
with
that
delicious
warming
effect
so
great
on
a
winter
night
too
bad
its
a
balmy
62
in
pa
right
now
a
solid
choice
for
a
malty
spring
dopplebock
this
is
widely
available
and
priced
right
super
malty
and
rough
enough
around
the
edges
to
keep
it
interesting
havent
had
a
doppelbock
since
münchen
in
september
and
this
brings
me
back
hits
the
spot
poured
a
1
pint
0
9
ounce
bottle
into
a
22
ounce
brandy
snifter
pours
dark
brown
with
a
dissipating
tan
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
the
smell
is
of
sweet
dark
roasted
malts
and
a
bit
of
caramel
theres
maybe
a
bit
of
fig
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
of
lightly
sweet
malt
fig
caramel
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
on
the
back
end
its
not
cloyingly
sweet
and
the
abv
is
not
noticeable
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
the
flavors
linger
in
the
mouth
but
it
is
very
pleasant
the
carbonation
is
well
done
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
is
still
one
of
my
favorites
o
a
little
less
substantial
than
i
was
expecting
after
some
other
recent
german
doppelbocks
but
still
decent
and
nice
overall
i
love
a
good
doppelbock
and
optimator
fits
the
bill
a
malt
lovers
dream
o
a
fantastic
doppelbock
im
definitely
going
back
for
some
more
a
very
nice
somewhat
ticker
beer
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
brown
hue
with
a
steady
amount
of
carbonation
and
lace
the
aroma
is
of
lighter
fruits
and
grains
the
beer
tastes
the
same
with
a
hint
of
molasses
and
caramel
in
the
mix
without
the
burn
leaves
an
okay
aftertaste
after
each
swig
and
goes
down
relatively
smooth
for
being
a
tad
bit
bitter
not
a
bad
effort
i
would
recommend
deep
red
in
color
with
orange
and
brown
hues
and
perfect
clarity
poured
with
a
thick
offwhite
foam
that
quickly
dissipated
delicate
smooth
oily
feel
sweet
caramel
and
toasted
malts
with
dark
fruit
aromas
with
bready
and
biscuit
undertones
flavors
are
much
the
same
as
aromas
caramel
and
toasted
malts
with
dark
fruit
through
the
front
and
middle
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
is
introduced
thru
the
middle
finishes
very
cleanly
generally
very
sweet
malty
and
very
enjoyable
o
i
always
enjoy
optimator
smooth
easy
drinking
and
very
flavorful
i
tend
to
prefer
salvator
but
still
a
good
beer
at
a
great
value
o
its
a
good
beer
cant
drink
very
many
with
the
highish
abv
its
nice
to
have
and
sip
with
dinner
or
lunch
as
i
did
pairs
well
with
a
heavy
dark
cigar
enjoyed
it
with
a
jfr
770
le
and
together
they
were
magic
overall
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
a
classic
dopplebock
in
my
opinion
o
a
solid
if
not
spectacular
double
bock
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
would
drink
it
again
but
not
up
there
with
the
best
i
have
had
overall
i
dont
think
this
beer
works
for
me
very
well
too
much
molassascaremel
and
boozy
flavor
this
is
an
excellent
lager
that
is
very
malty
ive
really
found
myself
enjoying
dark
lagers
lately
and
this
one
is
exceptional
surprisingly
drinkable
and
hides
its
slcohol
well
only
thing
that
bothers
me
at
all
is
the
sharp
metallic
mouthfeel
o
ayinger
clelebrator
is
my
most
favorite
doppelbock
and
it
is
hard
not
to
compare
the
optimator
to
that
beer
but
i
did
enjoy
it
and
would
drink
it
i
will
call
it
the
little
brother
to
celebrator
o
i
know
they
arent
exactly
in
the
same
category
but
im
a
bit
of
a
noob
so
ill
go
there
ill
take
this
over
newcastle
any
day
this
beer
lives
up
to
its
name
i
feel
optimized
overall
this
is
my
standard
for
what
a
double
bock
should
be
delicious
overall
a
classic
german
doppelbock
that
everyone
should
try
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
enjoyed
for
the
first
time
at
a
party
have
always
enjoyed
offerings
from
spaten
in
the
past
pours
a
caramel
color
not
much
head
smells
of
bread
or
brown
bread
toasted
malty
and
even
sweet
taste
is
much
the
same
bready
biscuity
malty
brown
sugar
or
molasses
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
o
bit
too
syrupy
for
my
liking
but
that
did
not
deter
my
drinking
and
liking
the
overall
product
will
drink
this
again
meh
its
good
it
meets
all
the
checkmarks
for
the
style
but
perhaps
is
a
bit
too
grainy
for
my
liking
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
pours
a
light
brownish
red
with
a
half
inch
of
off
white
head
and
little
lace
smell
brown
sugar
raisins
bread
and
clove
taste
is
all
of
them
combined
nothing
really
dominates
but
very
sweet
body
is
thinner
than
i
prefer
not
much
carbonation
not
overly
dry
and
easy
drinking
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
being
a
hop
head
wish
it
was
less
sweet
and
fuller
poured
a
dark
amber
brown
tan
head
with
good
retention
smelled
roasted
malts
dark
fruits
a
little
alcohol
can
definitely
taste
some
the
dark
fruits
roasted
carmels
brown
sugars
very
slight
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
heavy
smooth
and
velvety
a
good
doppelbock
one
i
recommend
for
sure
definitely
better
if
you
can
get
it
on
tap
o
a
solid
german
doppelbock
and
one
that
ive
had
quite
a
few
times
this
was
one
of
the
first
high
alcohol
craft
beers
that
i
really
remember
enjoying
overall
i
wish
i
could
get
this
fresh
this
is
a
good
beer
i
can
tell
but
age
has
taken
its
toll
its
too
bad
american
breweries
cannot
produce
top
quality
doppelbocks
at
this
price
o
pretty
good
beer
seems
to
fit
the
style
well
but
not
my
favorite
wouldnt
have
a
problem
drinking
it
again
overall
a
classic
doppelbock
with
perhaps
a
shade
too
much
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
but
not
so
overbearing
as
to
be
a
real
detriment
theres
no
reason
to
not
grab
one
any
time
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
german
doppel
overall
this
is
quite
good
beer
and
at
7
6
abv
decently
alcoholic
but
the
alcohol
well
hidden
by
the
sugary
malts
the
beer
is
wellbalanced
in
the
sugars
and
while
it
does
lack
a
distinctive
hop
quality
this
is
more
than
made
up
for
by
an
excellent
and
varied
grain
selection
well
worth
trying
o
im
a
bit
conflicted
on
this
one
i
like
the
way
it
tastes
but
i
dont
like
the
skunk
profile
i
get
on
the
nose
eh
what
the
hell
give
it
a
shot
its
decently
priced
for
a
rather
big
beer
this
is
a
style
ill
need
to
get
a
better
grip
on
in
the
future
to
see
if
its
really
up
my
alley
overall
not
world
class
by
any
means
but
optimator
is
a
great
beer
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
give
it
a
try
if
not
go
ahead
and
try
it
anyway
i
would
say
that
it
is
much
better
on
tap
what
beer
isnt
but
still
excellent
out
of
the
bottle
an
enjoyable
beer
seems
to
be
pretty
standard
with
what
ive
experienced
in
doppelbocks
so
far
this
beer
pours
a
deep
and
dark
reddish
brown
that
is
rich
in
both
aroma
and
appearance
the
head
on
this
beer
lingered
for
quite
a
while
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
extremely
sweet
molasses
like
scents
with
a
touch
of
husky
grain
and
some
plum
the
beer
is
intensely
delicious
with
flavors
of
burnt
sugars
and
grain
with
a
heavy
dose
of
molasses
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
but
almost
overpowered
by
the
sugary
sweet
raisin
and
fruit
flavors
there
is
a
lingering
taste
that
is
almost
how
a
cigarette
leaves
your
mouth
it
is
a
mildly
stale
and
burnt
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
thick
and
a
little
chewy
which
is
exactly
what
i
want
for
this
type
of
beer
overall
this
is
a
really
good
doppelbock
and
a
beer
i
could
enjoy
any
time
d
a
good
beer
within
the
style
but
i
think
it
lacks
character
id
have
it
again
but
certainly
not
a
goto
o
im
not
a
lager
drinker
and
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
that
said
i
could
certainly
see
myself
downing
one
or
two
after
a
long
day
of
skiing
a
solid
winter
lager
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
mug
this
pour
produced
a
good
212
to
3
finger
head
that
rapidly
dissipated
but
left
a
reasonable
amount
of
lacing
the
color
was
an
extremely
dark
amber
for
a
doppelbock
the
low
carbination
made
a
very
smooth
taste
and
mouthfeel
with
no
lingering
aftertaste
a
little
weak
for
my
taste
but
still
a
good
dopplebock
i
would
recommend
this
beer
and
buy
it
again
myself
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
and
has
great
balance
i
remember
there
being
more
of
a
smokey
taste
when
i
had
it
from
the
bottle
id
buy
it
again
o
very
enjoyable
nice
offering
of
the
style
good
beer
to
relax
with
o
while
its
not
on
the
same
level
as
ayinger
celebrator
its
also
half
the
price
a
very
good
basic
introduction
to
the
style
for
those
who
havent
enjoyed
a
doppelbock
before
notes
nice
decent
affordable
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
that
it
is
easy
to
forget
that
this
beer
has
a
big
abv
this
is
a
good
winter
everyday
beer
cheers
m
nice
and
pleasant
sensation
balanced
and
with
character
of
a
doppelbock
just
as
needed
for
the
style
overall
its
interesting
but
id
not
seek
it
out
too
often
overall
impression
like
many
times
with
the
nose
in
a
great
brew
i
keep
going
back
to
it
over
and
over
with
this
one
the
taste
was
so
great
that
my
glass
became
empty
quicker
then
usual
a
great
doppelbock
and
for
the
price
cannot
beat
i
will
gladly
be
keeping
12
of
these
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
to
throw
a
style
at
friends
that
theyve
never
had
before
this
is
probably
the
darkest
german
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
liked
it
a
lot
but
i
personally
prefer
the
paulaner
salvator
because
its
a
bit
more
smooth
to
me
this
beer
is
great
and
if
you
think
the
darker
the
better
this
could
be
your
favorite
beer
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
overall
a
really
nice
beer
but
just
not
up
my
alley
i
would
recommend
it
though
and
will
probably
buy
it
again
for
certain
occasions
i
think
it
would
go
great
with
a
steak
or
meaty
dinner
o
i
found
this
tough
to
drink
in
a
quiet
setting
since
the
only
times
i
have
had
this
beer
is
at
biergartens
still
a
very
good
beer
though
clear
mahogany
brown
and
only
a
slight
amount
of
head
that
vanishes
quickly
no
bubbles
in
site
after
a
minute
or
two
light
nose
with
only
faint
aromas
of
nutty
toasted
malts
some
fruitiness
and
alcohol
as
well
flavor
is
rich
sweetness
and
dark
bakers
chocolate
finishes
with
a
dark
fruity
and
alcohol
burn
in
the
nose
sweet
candied
tingle
on
the
tongue
at
first
but
as
the
beer
warms
the
alcohol
because
extremely
present
and
almost
pungent
after
you
swallow
thick
and
smooth
body
but
that
changes
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
o
overall
a
very
nice
beer
my
first
foray
into
the
style
and
i
enjoyed
highly
drinkable
watch
that
abv
but
still
complex
and
very
interesting
ill
be
coming
back
to
this
a
very
enjoyable
drink
overall
this
is
a
very
rich
restrained
beer
im
not
a
huge
a
fan
of
the
style
usually
but
this
was
excellent
a
deep
brown
almost
black
with
red
highlights
to
the
bodyrelatively
small
white
head
that
did
not
last
long
tasted
very
much
of
dark
fruitcakenicea
hint
of
clove
perhaps
the
alchohol
is
well
hidden
o
really
enjoyed
it
the
alcholol
was
well
hidden
smelled
and
tasted
good
for
the
style
rich
deep
not
as
good
as
some
other
dopplebocks
ive
had
but
a
strong
representation
none
the
less
overall
a
hearty
doppelbock
that
delivers
days
though
i
would
probably
pick
something
else
before
this
one
fun
to
revisit
nonetheless
should
be
tried
by
all
i
tried
this
one
on
the
recommendation
of
a
schnauzer
and
was
not
disappointed
it
now
ranks
in
my
top
5
favorite
beers
overall
i
like
this
beer
my
only
complaint
is
the
lack
of
intensity
in
aroma
but
the
aroma
itself
is
good
i
like
the
taste
very
much
and
the
mouthfeel
and
appearance
are
pretty
good
too
i
will
buy
this
again
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
this
beer
is
amazing
i
drink
the
beer
and
it
just
makes
me
feel
happy
that
such
a
huge
company
can
make
such
a
quality
beer
i
will
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
overall
if
a
bmc
drinker
likes
guiness
they
might
like
this
one
this
is
certainly
a
heavier
beer
than
guiness
but
it
is
not
too
far
away
on
the
flavor
spectrum
a
solid
offering
maybe
not
world
class
even
though
it
has
been
around
for
a
ling
time
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
in
the
fall
quite
malty
i
would
have
liked
a
little
bit
less
grape
flavor
it
looks
fantastic
but
taint
12
99
for
a
twelve
pack
in
atlanta
ga
overall
this
is
a
very
well
rounded
beer
i
like
the
strength
and
complexity
of
the
flavors
it
will
stand
up
well
to
strong
food
pairings
notes
if
you
like
malt
which
i
do
you
will
love
this
beer
really
nicely
balanced
a
stellar
brew
o
overall
this
a
good
stuff
has
enough
bite
for
me
and
is
tasty
as
well
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
germans
its
right
on
key
with
what
i
expected
out
of
it
this
stuff
isnt
too
bad
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
and
could
use
a
bit
more
complexity
descent
drinking
nonetheless
overall
great
example
of
a
doppelbock
that
manages
to
have
a
sweet
malty
taste
while
also
maintaining
a
fairly
dry
and
spicy
palate
not
quite
top
tier
but
well
above
average
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
strong
taste
nice
malted
hop
flavor
would
definitely
buy
again
no
foam
this
beer
is
potent
the
sensation
to
compare
the
mouthfeel
to
is
after
getting
shot
up
with
novocaine
at
the
dentists
office
i
got
two
sixers
today
and
am
going
to
get
hammered
tonight
o
the
double
shovel
is
tasty
and
almost
always
means
good
times
are
around
the
bend
as
my
uncle
says
lets
get
optimated
this
beer
poured
dark
and
without
any
head
to
speak
of
this
beer
didnt
have
a
very
distinct
taste
or
smell
to
me
the
aroma
was
a
little
malty
with
a
sharp
afterthought
that
didnt
translate
to
the
taste
it
wasnt
offensive
and
it
was
very
drinkable
but
it
wont
go
on
my
list
of
favorites
overall
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
ive
tried
rich
really
classy
ill
be
seeing
this
little
beverage
a
lot
in
my
future
bravo
some
viscosity
balanced
by
quick
sharp
bubbles
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
highlighted
by
crisp
clear
and
concise
flavors
o
a
solid
doppelbock
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
widely
available
and
reasonably
priced
not
my
top
pick
but
one
i
would
likely
buy
again
i
like
this
beer
it
didnt
blow
my
mind
but
it
was
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
despite
approaching
8
its
very
drinkable
its
dark
and
somewhat
hoppy
the
malt
is
dark
and
in
your
face
its
a
well
balanced
doppelbock
i
am
having
it
for
a
repeat
and
will
repeat
again
it
is
a
great
german
beer
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
easygoing
in
flavor
optimators
a
doppelbock
you
can
drink
easily
but
rewards
deeper
pondering
as
well
its
best
enjoyed
when
sitting
in
front
of
a
fireplace
in
the
dark
do
this
is
the
second
time
ive
ever
had
this
the
first
being
last
summer
and
its
just
as
pleasing
as
i
remember
it
a
solid
if
not
leader
or
flagship
of
the
style
example
a
great
way
to
start
off
dopplebockfest
2011
with
fdkayti
overall
a
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
for
breakfast
or
after
a
good
meal
for
desert
this
is
a
great
example
of
how
beer
can
be
bread
in
liquid
form
and
is
an
instant
classic
for
that
matter
overall
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
but
i
would
prefer
a
richer
head
other
doppels
that
i
enjoyed
had
a
nice
thick
head
that
lasted
throughout
the
beer
this
critique
is
rather
minor
for
this
beer
though
a
good
doppel
for
those
who
like
the
style
little
on
the
lighter
side
but
still
some
nice
flavors
this
is
a
good
solid
doppelbock
sticky
sweet
but
not
cloying
smooth
mouthfeel
one
of
my
favorit
beers
of
all
time
when
its
on
tap
and
is
still
pretty
great
out
of
a
bottle
clear
medium
brown

some
visible
effervescence
white

medium
dissipation
with
decent
lacing
classic
doppelbock
nose
prunes
raisins
burnt
brown
sugar
molasses
floral
hops
mouthfeel
very
full
meal
replacement
indeed
a
bit
sticky
alcohol
a
bit
noticeable
while
not
as
full
flavored
as
celebrator
certainly
a
classic
example
of
the
style
overall
not
particularly
offensive
although
the
heats
a
bit
annoying
at
this
level
but
this
is
definitely
forgettable
d
the
alcohols
concealed
very
well
but
its
pretty
heavy
and
a
little
sweet
for
a
multibottle
outing
a
tasty
not
too
big
dopplebock
should
definitely
be
tried
im
not
a
huge
lager
guy
but
i
enjoyed
this
dont
get
me
wrong
i
can
appreciate
them
but
im
an
ale
man
at
heart
that
being
said
this
was
a
good
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
dark
head
huge
bubbles
almost
like
coca
cola
nutty
aroma
smooth
crisp
taste
slightly
bitter
but
pleasing
finish
good
drinkability
for
this
type
of
beer
which
normally
is
not
my
favorite
the
beer
is
dark
brownblack
with
a
thin
head
the
smell
is
slightly
skunky
liquorice
fennel
rye
bread
the
taste
is
sweet
with
plum
and
caramel
it
is
rich
and
malty
with
a
pleasant
malted
milk
shake
aftertaste

wow
where
how
could
you
not
love
this
beer
m
mediumfull
bodied
beer
that
is
very
creamy
the
carbonation
is
really
nice
on
this
one
clears
your
palate
at
the
end
leaving
a
somewhat
wet
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
even
when
served
at
fridge
temp
impressive
t
not
a
beer
for
the
weak
of
heart
freshly
baked
rye
bread
all
over
with
some
brown
sugar
figs
raisin
and
some
yeast
syrupy
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
the
taste
this
isnt
the
best
doppelbock
out
there
but
its
a
really
good
one
and
the
fact
that
its
not
priced
like
a
specialty
beer
at
allcheaper
than
good
american
crafts
around
heremake
this
a
goto
of
the
style
t
its
a
good
beer
and
for
1
99
for
a
16oz
bottle
will
pick
one
up
again
o
you
forget
that
lagers
can
be
thick
and
chew
just
like
some
of
the
bigger
stouts
and
barleywines
out
there
im
really
digging
this
one
its
a
nice
reprieve
from
all
the
summer
beers
ive
been
drinking
of
late
its
also
a
nice
reminder
that
germans
still
make
good
beer
overall
spaten
knows
what
its
doing
and
for
the
relatively
inexpensive
price
cheaper
than
a
celebrator
its
a
pretty
good
value
those
who
appreciate
the
genre
should
definitely
try
it
o
i
liked
this
one
a
solid
doppelbock
oi
simply
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
as
much
as
others
and
will
likely
not
try
again
pours
an
impenetrably
dark
brown
with
a
small
white
head
with
decent
retention
aromas
promise
sweet
flavors
to
come
my
nose
picks
up
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
like
raisins
dates
and
prunes
with
a
molasses
like
sweetness
tastewise
i
love
that
this
doppelbock
avoids
the
trap
of
cloying
qualities
theres
nothing
over
the
top
about
its
taste
and
yet
it
thoroughly
delivers
on
every
nose
hint
its
subdued
and
subtle
character
make
it
far
more
drinkable
than
most
members
of
its
style
a
benchmark
of
its
type
a
tasty
toasty
german
bock
poured
a
hazelbrown
with
reddish
highlights
moderate
carbonation
and
a
thin
offwhite
head
mild
and
smooth
aroma
of
sweet
toasty
malts
and
caramel
more
sweet
toasted
malts
in
the
taste
toffee
raisin
and
apple
peel
maybe
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
medium
mouthfeel
and
pretty
easily
drinkable
o
i
didnt
like
it
as
much
as
everyone
else
apparently
it
seems
to
have
a
little
bit
of
skunk
to
it
very
delicious
dark
thick
full
beer
oddly
atypical
for
a
german
brewery
they
are
most
famous
for
their
strong
weiss
beers
and
midrange
dark
beers
this
is
a
roasty
malty
and
slightly
sweet
brew
full
of
rich
carmel
notes
and
coffee
hints
i
had
this
in
a
pint
at
wolfes
beirgarden
in
albany
ny
served
nonicecold
was
best
and
this
is
definitely
a
higherend
leisurely
drinking
beer
to
enjoy
with
some
wurst
and
spatzel
delicious
its
an
interesting
and
unique
profile
that
works
very
well
together
a
very
unique
and
adventurous
brew
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
brown
color
with
some
shades
of
red
in
it
the
head
in
a
bit
fizzy
and
white
not
leaving
much
on
the
glass
after
each
sip
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
very
nice
malt
back
bone
to
it
with
a
light
sweetness
coming
though
the
taste
of
the
beer
brings
the
malts
onto
the
tongue
full
force
and
really
leaves
a
good
pleasing
flavor
in
your
mouth
theres
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
in
the
flavor
too
with
a
pretty
good
bitterness
in
the
end
the
mouthfeel
isnt
heavy
but
just
about
medium
overall
i
think
that
this
is
probably
my
favorite
from
spaten
the
oktoberfest
being
second
dark
ruby
brownish
color
one
finger
head
with
just
a
bit
of
lacing
there
is
some
nice
persistent
bubbles
coming
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
almost
like
sparkling
wine
aroma
is
dark
caramel
maybe
toffee
grains
and
an
herbal
note
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
a
bit
of
a
coffee
finish
lighter
though
like
drip
coffee
this
beer
has
a
really
pleasant
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
affordable
example
of
the
style
even
though
not
top
in
the
category
doppelbock
is
a
style
thats
been
brewed
for
hundreds
of
years
its
an
incredible
relic
of
german
brewing
tradition
while
i
personally
feel
that
ayinger
celebrator
is
the
epitome
of
the
style
i
must
insist
that
there
exists
few
especially
among
german
brewed
examples
that
dont
exemplify
its
rich
gratifying
wonders
optimator
certainly
does
still
sittin
at
the
brauhaus
watching
the
cubs
tank
another
game
sad
really
anyway
this
brew
pours
a
clear
dark
sunset
burnt
siennaamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
buttery
caramel
very
light
roasted
malts
brown
sugar
and
belgian
candi
sugar
the
taste
holds
notes
of
buttery
caramel
light
roasted
malts
brown
sugar
cinnamon
faintish
dark
greens
and
some
mild
cocoa
powder
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
solid
dbock
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
mighty
tasty
and
enjoyable
o
very
good
beer
recommended
to
try
at
least
once
if
not
more
overall
a
wonferfull
beer
was
really
impressed
with
the
drinkability
i
love
a
good
dopplebock
and
this
one
is
nice
and
unique
it
is
a
great
german
beer
tasty
but
a
slow
sipper
pours
dark
brown
color
caramel
perhaps
with
light
tan
head
nose
is
bready
with
very
traditional
doppelbock
character
palate
is
light
flavored
and
bodied
compared
to
other
doppelbocks
good
malt
core
with
light
roasty
and
brown
sugar
like
flavors
faint
hopping
for
balance
smooth
easy
drinking
what
a
refreshing
doppelbock
i
wasnt
expecting
to
like
this
as
much
it
grows
on
you
if
you
like
the
sweet
malty
style
but
i
would
say
there
are
more
interesting
examples
of
doppelbocks
including
americanmade
versions
but
for
a
widelydistributed
major
beer
that
actually
makes
the
boat
trip
its
a
winner
bottom
line
this
is
why
we
dont
put
beers
in
green
bottles
im
sure
this
import
version
isnt
as
good
as
the
real
deal
in
deutschland
and
the
fact
that
it
made
a
long
journey
a
long
time
ago
makes
this
particular
example
a
disappointment
ill
be
keeping
an
eye
out
for
a
fresher
version
o
hard
to
rate
this
beer
as
it
did
have
some
good
flavors
but
it
also
had
some
bad
ones
a
medium
body
and
prickly
carbonation
make
for
a
decent
combination
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
but
i
just
dislike
the
dry
finish
combined
with
the
sweetness
in
the
taste
drinkability
is
ok
but
held
back
by
the
finish
and
alcohol
both
the
taste
and
abv
components
d
good
drinkability
its
a
nice
filling
beer
overalli
want
to
leave
room
for
improvement
right
now
because
i
have
a
special
bond
with
this
beer
and
with
all
the
dopplebock
talk
lately
i
wanted
to
grab
this
and
a
salvatorwhich
i
may
drink
next
but
for
the
price
this
beer
is
outstanding
and
highly
underrated
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
kind
of
enjoyable
but
there
is
nothing
about
it
that
really
stands
out
to
much
o
this
is
a
supremely
elegant
and
sublime
example
of
the
doppelbock
category
required
tasting
for
any
doppelbock
kenner
overall
a
good
beer
that
has
nice
flavor
and
good
looks
i
really
enjoy
the
combination
of
really
dark
beer
that
is
more
sweet
than
roasty
nice
and
a
good
representative
of
the
style
overall
drinkability
overall
a
solidly
good
beer
quite
dangerous
in
that
i
finished
this
off
in
no
time
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
great
by
itself
and
good
with
a
meal
ham
steaks
an
mac
n
cheese
in
this
case
and
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
this
beer
pours
almost
black
with
some
red
showing
through
the
aroma
is
chocolate
anise
and
roasted
malt
its
flavor
begins
with
chocolate
with
molasses
coffee
and
finishes
with
dark
chocolate
very
well
balanced
its
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
spaten
optimator
is
a
very
good
beer
filling
yet
satisfying
a
good
representation
of
the
style
highly
recommended
the
rest
full
fairly
creamy
body
with
decent
balance
this
beer
has
the
bitterness
to
support
what
could
have
been
an
overly
sweet
beer
pretty
tasty
it
poured
a
very
dark
brown
brown
that
was
barely
clear
with
about
a
centimeter
tan
head
that
quickly
reduce
to
a
millimeter
it
smelled
of
sweet
roasted
malts
cat
food
and
a
tiny
bit
like
chocolate
tasted
sweet
of
roasted
caramel
malt
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
it
has
some
hops
to
balance
it
and
is
also
a
bit
sour
the
sourness
was
unexpected
i
suppose
its
probably
just
part
of
the
espresso
flavour
thats
to
be
expected
but
i
could
have
done
with
a
little
less
of
it
it
was
a
very
nice
creamy
roasted
malt
experience
had
a
tiny
bit
of
that
cat
food
flavour
that
i
smelled
more
prominently
on
the
nose
but
it
had
a
nice
array
of
malt
flavours
to
cover
it
up
and
make
for
a
delicious
experience
at
8
99
a
six
pack
this
is
a
great
go
to
beer
for
any
occasion
it
always
seems
to
have
a
place
in
my
fridge
a
solid
german
example
spaten
optimator
is
a
copper
brown
lager
with
a
thin
khaki
head
that
fades
to
a
turbulent
film
and
leaves
nice
lacing
it
has
a
deep
malty
aroma
bready
and
a
bit
sweet
it
smells
grainy
and
spicy
with
a
hint
of
apple
perhaps
in
the
mouth
its
full
bodied
and
a
little
sharp
the
finish
is
a
little
sticky
its
pretty
sweet
and
raisny
with
notes
of
prune
and
maybe
fig
its
very
malty
and
bready
the
finish
has
a
hint
of
bitter
juniper
and
alcohol
its
a
sturdy
drink
too
hardy
to
session
but
its
quite
smooth
overall
this
is
not
a
classic
like
salvator
but
it
is
a
good
example
good
malt
good
carbonation
enough
bitterness
to
balance
but
not
show
itself
good
beer
id
kick
back
a
few
liter
steins
of
this
fine
brew
superb
beer
i
was
honestly
suprised
ive
had
other
dopplebocks
but
this
is
one
that
honestly
brought
me
back
to
munich
highly
recommended
to
drink
this
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
poured
a
dark
brownish
color
with
very
little
beige
head
on
it
smell
is
rich
toffee
malt
taste
is
very
heavy
malt
with
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
coming
through
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
from
the
malt
overall
a
decent
beer
im
not
a
big
fan
but
its
alright
for
2
bucks
a
good
beer
from
the
bottle
it
pours
dark
mahogany
brown
with
a
thin
head
the
nose
is
rich
and
malty
with
understated
hops
you
can
tell
its
a
dopplebock
very
rich
malty
flavor
the
hops
are
deeply
buried
rich
malty
taste
to
match
the
nose
has
a
somewhat
salty
finish
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
an
excellent
lager
very
tasty
and
flavorful
a
bit
heavy
for
drinking
a
lot
of
but
shares
a
lot
of
flavors
with
the
best
of
the
dark
belgian
styles
of
ales
interesting
that
you
can
get
that
level
of
flavor
from
a
lager
worth
seeking
out
and
i
will
hopefully
have
one
again
d
its
drinkable
but
strong
and
sweet
so
its
not
something
i
would
drink
all
night
long
but
definitely
something
i
get
every
time
im
at
the
german
bar
after
a
few
pints
of
a
nice
pilsner
warning
this
is
an
a
b
inbev
beer
most
people
dont
realize
this
this
is
a
very
dark
beer
that
has
malt
liquor
listed
on
the
label
it
is
moderately
strong
7
2
which
an
average
beer
drinker
probably
would
not
like
has
a
strong
grape
earthy
after
taste
with
a
hint
of
what
i
like
to
call
liquid
smoke
taste
roasts
very
sudsy
with
lacing
high
sugar
content
left
on
the
inside
of
the
bottle
quite
drinkable
an
easy
drinking
refreshing
doppelbock
hides
alcohol
very
well
id
say
this
is
a
beer
anyone
could
handle
and
go
back
to
again
pours
a
clear
cola
color
with
a
nice
2
inch
tan
head
thin
ring
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
caramel
malt
brown
sugar
and
maybe
some
apple
peels
taste
is
of
caramel
malt
plumprune
slight
cocoa
powder
slight
hop
bitterness
after
each
sip
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
lighter
body
than
i
would
have
expected
for
this
beer
slight
alcohol
burn
is
present
but
doesnt
detract
from
the
beer
good
drinkability
on
this
beer
i
would
love
to
have
this
at
a
german
restaurant
with
some
sausages
and
sauerkraut
d
i
used
to
fear
this
in
my
variety
case
and
now
its
the
most
flavorful
offering
in
it
alcohol
is
there
and
well
hidden
best
doppelbock
i
ever
had
sausages
are
delicious
no
regrets
a
good
doppelbock
but
not
a
great
one
the
flavor
is
good
but
it
lacks
the
complexity
and
awesomeness
of
some
other
doppelbocks
solid
but
definitely
not
my
fav
this
beer
wont
knock
your
socks
off
in
terms
of
the
seasoned
beer
drinker
but
if
your
just
getting
into
doppelbocks
please
try
this
as
well
as
great
lakes
doppelrock
highly
drinkable
perhaps
more
pairable
with
general
foods
than
a
barleywine
but
not
exceedingly
unique
a
bit
of
a
glorified
budweisertype
lager
in
taste
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
brown
head
has
a
mediumhigh
level
of
carbonation
looks
almost
sodalike
malty
aroma
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
roasted
grain
to
me
it
looks
and
smells
like
a
porter
but
thinner
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
i
expected
but
still
pleasant
moderate
hop
presence
mostly
a
malty
taste
but
also
has
a
noticeable
alcohol
warmth
to
it
a
tasty
mellow
beer
that
isnt
as
bitter
or
strong
as
i
expected
it
is
very
drinkable
for
a
7
2
abv
beer
as
an
imported
macro
brew
im
pretty
impressed
my
dad
was
in
the
air
force
and
spent
time
in
germany
and
had
this
beer
back
in
the
1960s
he
said
i
had
to
try
some
i
am
glad
i
did
this
is
a
full
body
beer
that
will
put
you
to
sleep
if
you
are
used
to
american
beers
be
warned
this
beer
will
put
you
to
sleep
the
body
first
hits
the
tongue
in
a
violent
wave
of
carbonation
which
mellows
out
into
an
average
if
slightly
syrupy
body
there
is
not
an
overly
complex
malt
layout
there
are
definitely
some
toasted
malts
and
wheat
amidst
a
sweet
dark
malt
base
as
the
beer
plays
out
in
your
mouth
raisin
flavors
emerge
from
beneath
the
malt
and
finish
dryly
on
the
tongue
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
each
sip
there
is
a
faint
but
present
hop
character
a
fleeting
freshness
in
the
middle
of
a
heap
of
malts
this
isnt
in
the
running
for
the
worlds
best
double
bock
but
the
price
is
right
and
it
is
a
quality
drinkable
imported
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
doppelbock
i
am
surprised
at
some
of
the
low
reviews
that
it
gets
the
abv
seems
perfect
for
the
brew
and
it
pours
a
beautiful
dark
rubybrown
color
smells
of
caramel
raisons
bread
and
rich
fruit
very
little
head
but
i
didnt
give
it
much
of
a
chance
to
get
one
drank
it
with
some
light
apps
and
enjoyed
it
so
much
had
a
second
definitely
will
add
this
to
my
stash
enjoy
all
around
it
was
a
good
brew
that
remained
just
as
good
as
it
warmed
up
compared
to
when
fresh
from
the
reefer
m
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
pours
ruby
black
with
red
tints
if
held
up
to
the
light
decent
sized
cream
colored
head
that
dissolves
slowly
smells
good
malty
sweetness
great
taste
malts
roasted
without
being
burnt
and
a
slight
hint
of
raisin
sweetness
creamy
without
being
thick
a
full
refreshing
smooth
mouthfeel
good
level
of
carbonation
fairly
high
alcohol
content
but
you
wouldnt
know
it
very
drinkable
for
this
style
could
have
several
a
very
good
beer
d
an
excellent
doppelbock
and
the
one
i
would
pick
out
of
the
four
on
tap
at
my
local
beer
bar
i
would
pick
first
from
notes
poured
a
dark
dirty
brown
with
some
amber
notes
aroma
of
sweet
malt
wheat
caramel
and
brown
sugar
not
bursting
with
aroma
flavor
was
pretty
minerally
perhaps
too
much
so
initially
but
that
goes
away
caramel
and
brown
sugar
notes
are
very
strong
some
vanilla
and
brea
thin
mouthfeel
and
a
good
drinkable
beer
has
a
mediocre
drinkibility
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
but
has
limited
drinkibility
because
of
carbonation
and
alcohol
content
drinkability
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
but
it
is
pretty
sweet
with
a
strong
dark
fruit
flavor
i
could
probably
drink
one
more
of
these
but
not
another
not
my
favorite
but
i
would
drink
again
d
yeah
it
was
ok
just
ok
d
a
damn
good
dopplebock
i
will
definitely
get
this
again
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
ruby
hues
around
the
edges
there
is
a
small
head
which
is
slightly
khaki
and
gives
way
to
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
little
faint
there
is
some
breadiness
dark
fruits
and
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
nice
but
not
super
complex
caramel
malt
some
breadiness
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
moderately
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
above
average
it
is
a
smooth
easy
drink
however
it
lacks
some
complexity
to
keep
you
really
interested
the
beer
is
solid
drinkability
one
of
the
best
of
this
style
it
doesnt
have
the
wow
factor
of
my
favorite
dopplebock
bells
consecrator
but
this
is
pretty
close
to
topshelf
stuff
overall
im
linking
this
beer
its
a
good
traditional

drinkability
is
wonderful
such
a
nice
sweet
balanced

very
sessionable
drinkability
this
beer
would
take
some
getting
used
to
for
me
its
nothing
really
bad
its
just
different
i
do
love
the
color
of
this
brew
but
i
personally
dont
think
i
could
make
a
night
of
it
doppelbocks
just
must
not
be
my
thing
probably
great
ontap
or
very
fresh
overall
it
was
ok
not
great
but
ok
i
mean
i
wasnt
impression
taste
was
a
little
weak
nothing
that
im
in
love
with
in
the
end
eh
d
good
easy
to
drink
doppelbock
i
almost
forget
its
close
to
8
fuller
rich
body
medium
carbonation
smooth
on
the
palate
decent
drinking
with
enjoyable
flavor
and
a
solid
example
of
the
style
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
for
7
6
abv
this
one
could
get
me
in
trouble
not
too
complex
not
too
sweet
not
especially
toasty
very
easy
to
drink
d
the
flavor
is
a
bit
too
simple
not
to
mention
not
spectacular
for
me
to
really
enjoy
this
one
slightly
cloying
near
the
end
of
the
glass
though
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
and
the
thin
body
make
it
quite
manageable
d
something
holding
it
back
i
think
its
the
alcohol
taste
it
adds
to
the
flavor
in
a
good
way
but
im
not
sure
i
could
kick
back
several
in
one
sitting
mouthfeel
full
body
and
balanced
carbonation
overall
an
acceptable
example
but
not
an
exceptional
one
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
very
drinkable
to
the
point
i
want
to
know
more
about
this
style
drinkability
very
drinkable
but
keep
in
mind
a
sixpack
of
optimator
is
worth
a
twelve
pack
of
lesser
beers
in
terms
of
the
effects
where
i
live
a
case
of

stuff

optimator
was
a
very
dark
redbrown
color
with
good
clarity
when
held
to
a
light
it
had
a
light
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
sweet
dark
malt
and
a
touch
toasty
the
taste
was
malty
and
sweet
as
well
with
a
little

towards
the

the
finish
was
long

semidry
it
was

with

drinkability
was
good
this
is
a
good
doppelbock
that
is

improves
as
it
warms
with
some
fruitiness
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
coming

good

however
as
it
got

not

good
i
love
this

i
think
we
have
a
winner
d
thought
the
beer
would
be
thicker
based
on
the
color
prefered
it
when
colder
mahogany
hued
capped
by
a
thin
beige
head
the
nose
is
heavy
on
raisins
and
prunes
with
nutty
bready
malt
beneath
theres
a
slight
vinous
aroma
that
lends
some
complexity
the
palate
is
very
similar
a
lot
of
raisin
and
prune
flavor
above
a
backbone
of
toasted
malt
moderately
sweet
fairly
vinous
toward
the
finish
with
some
metallic
astringency
this
isnt
bad
but
its
far
from
my
favorite
doppelbock
too
reminiscent
of
prune
juice
dgood
flavor
and
mouthfeel
combined
with
medium
body
make
this
one
that
can
be
downed
over
and
over
again
a
solid
doppelbock
made
by
one
of
the
classic
german
breweries
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
although
i
am
not
usually
a
lager
person
i
have
been
getting
more
into
doppelbocks
recently
and
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
really
drinkable
at
7
2
definitely
better
as
it
warms
d
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
imo
prefere
a
bit
more
body
otherwise
strong
offering
from
a
classic
brewery
d
i
could
drink
more
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
but
i
dont
think
i
want
to
this
beer
takes
on
a
rich
flavor
with
a
distinct
malty
taste
i
enjoy
its
chocolate
and
amber
flavors
you
get
just
enough
without
it
being
to
overpowering
this
beer
also
has
a
nice
alcohol
percentage
of
7
2
which
is
just
right
for
this
style
of
beer
you
tend
to
not
notice
the
alcohol
with
the
balance
of
the
malt
d
you
feel
the
alcohol
on
this
pretty
quickly
although
it
isnt
immediately
noticed
when
consuming
leading
me
to
think
i
could
drink
a
number
of
these
i
assume
i
would
easily
be
feeling
it
after
2
or
three
overall
although
i
admit
i
havent
tried
a
wide
variety
of
doppelbock
this
one
rates
up
there
among
the
better
ones
that
i
have
tried
if
i
had
access
to
this
beer
more
often
it
would
easily
become
one
of
my
regulars
this
is
a
decent
doppelbock
good
flavor
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
one
but
i
wouldnt
look
for
it
drinkability
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
and
annoying
but
overall
this
is
a
fine
drink
and
a
good
introductory
beer
to
the
doppelbock
style
the
optimator
remains
one
of
those
standby
doppelbocks
if
one
cant
find
any
superior
beers
of
the
style
available
the
price
is
generally
right
and
this
is
an
standard
bearer
of
the
style
but
it
still
pales
in
comparison
to
the
pinnacles
of
the
style
due
to
its
lackluster
scent
and
somewhat
tame
taste
d
superb
even
at
the
high
abv
id
kill
a
sixer
no
problemo
d
very
drinkable
for
the
style
bought
a
bottle
for
german
night
in
the
house
drinking
with
brats
and
kraut
poured
into
a
mug
this
is
a
lovely
dark
browncaramel
coloring
with
a
large
foamy
light
head
the
smells
are
rich
in
malt
the
increased
carbonation
helps
to
balance
the
heavy
molasses
flavoring
its
sweet
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
in
mouth
and
surprisingly
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
especially
with
this
type
of
meal
fantastic
to
drink
and
even
better
to
cook
with
notes
one
of
my
favorites
breakfast
beer
it
is
a
little
thrown
off
by
the
label
reading
malt
liqour
on
the
side
guessing
no
hops
dm
beautifully
smooth
drinking
especially
for
a
dopplebock
drinks
much
lighter
than
expected
and
yet
still
has
a
great
depth
of
flavor
that
really
makes
it
an
enticing
brew
drinkability
this
has
been
a
favorite
beer
of
mine
for
a
while
even
before
i
thought
about
reviewing
beers
its
a
heavy
beer
that
doesnt
require
a
refill
because
it
satisfies
so
much
youll
want
to
pick
up
an
optimator
to
help
you
wash
down
your
dinner
or
to
celebrate
deep
rubybrown
pour
with
a
medium
foamy
head
that
sticks
around
a
while
aroma
of
sweet
roasty
caramel
malt
and
light
sweet
fruitiness
flavor
is
the
same
loads
of
roasty
malt
and
hints
of
caramel
a
bit
of
alcohol
bite
on
the
finish
but
not
enough
to
be
distracting
still
smooooth
body
needs
to
be
a
bit
heavier
not
the
best
doppel
bock
but
this
is
well
worth
it
thanx
doug
k
d
a
solid
doppelbock
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
notes
enjoyable
beer
but
not
my
favorite
doppelbock
this
one
is
more
of
a
fruity
doppelbock
rather
than
chocolate
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
given
its
history
but
i
dont
think
it
is
my
favorite
of
the
style
and
what
boosted
my
impression
was
the
great
setting
jacob
wirths
restaurant
the
oldest
german
restaurant
in
the
us
good
times
d
a
good
bock
with
enough
character
to
keep
things
interesting
abv
to
be
expected
so
all
in
all
very
drinkable
pours
a
deep
reddishbrown
with
small
head
and
minimal
lacing
smells
of
caramel
molasses
dark
chocolate
and
alcohol
tastes
strongly
of
molasses
caramel
and
alcohol
very
similar
to
smell
overall
a
strong
doppelbock
with
a
punch
at
7
2
abv
a
nice
doppelbock
dont
drink
too
many
of
these
at
this
high
abv
a
very
nice
doppelbock
probably
one
of
y
favorite
ones
because
of
the
smooth
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
great
german
beer
d
very
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
dopplebocks
quite
smooth
for
7
2
i
could
easily
forget
this
should
be
a
sipping
beer
notes
a
nice
doppelbock
that
has
its
ups
and
downs
if
it
would
chill
out
a
little
and
not
try
so
hard
it
could
be
even
better
than
it
is
i
would
probably
only
drink
one
of
these
at
a
time
primarily
because
it
is
fairly
strong
at
7
2
but
also
because
its
a
very
unique
flavor
that
i
wouldnt
want
to
desensitize
myself
to
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
thats
just
enough
to
make
it
nice
a
creamy
for
a
fairly
big
beer
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
it
was
decently
drinkable
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
and
tons
of
pretty
lacing
that
leave
cobwebs
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
smells
of
dark
chocolate
licorice
vanilla
bean
and
roasted
barley
tastes
sweet
from
plenty
of
sweet
malts
deep
dark
chocolate
fresh
vanilla
bean
sweet
licorice
and
a
little
acidity
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
drinkability
is
great
i
thought
the
beer
had
pretty
decent
body
and
while
i
did
not
have
more
than
one
i
thought
it
was
relatively
drinkable
pours
a
moderate
brown
caramel
color
win
a
light
tan
head
with
some
good
lasting
power
in
my
pilsner
glass
nose
brings
caramel
toffee
and
some
light
drugs
the
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
with
some
caramel
though
not
too
much
depth
nice
body
and
carbonation
a
beer
i
used
to
drink
fairly
often
and
dont
mind
coming
back
to
at
all
as
with
most
dopplebocks
its
big
enough
that
im
only
going
to
do
one
as
a
sitting
but
that
one
goes
down
very
easily
considering
how
much
easier
it
is
for
me
to
get
a
hold
of
than
celebrator
easier
even
than
centrals
dopplebocks
and
how
inexpensive
it
is
this
will
likely
be
my
go
to
dobblebock
for
the
near
future
d
a
good
but
not
quite
great
doppelbock
i
enjoyed
it
and
the
price
point
on
it
is
pretty
good
final
notes
a
solid
doppelbock
and
one
ill
return
to
many
times
over
would
be
a
great
steak
and
potatoes
type
beer
dthis
is
my
first
doppelbock
and
although
good
it
was
not
especially
impressive
pics
at
httpdefinitionale
com20101013tastingthespatenoptimator
overall
a
solid
dark
beer
perfect
for
post
oktoberfest
consumption
d
nice
evening
sipper
think
its
more
of
an
early
fall
mid
spring
beer
but
fit
this
little
one
man
session
well
notes
better
than
ayingers
celebrator
because
it
was
not
as
cloying
poured
into
a
nonstem
pilsner
glass
the
dark
translucent
brown
liquid
is
rich
with
cascading
foam
this
is
a
smooth
munich
dopplebock
with
spatens
flavor
personality
present
from
start
to
finish
rich
malty
caramel
notes
with
hops
support
and
substantial
strength
although
not
anywhere
near
as
strong
as
american
overthetop
attempts
on
this
style
samuel
adams
for
example
instead
you
have
a
well
rounded
malt
showcase
that
when
served
too
cold
only
improves
with
the
rising
temperature
some
very
good
ester
notes
of
dark
fruit
combined
with
a
lingering
dry
finish
makes
this
a
pleasure
there
is
nothing
out
of
place
here
a
historic
and
yet
very
contemporary
drinking
experience
dvery
high
the
7
abv
does
not
preclude
sessioning
with
this
bought
this
beer
on
a
recomendation
from
a
good
friend
drinking
buddy
my
first
impression
as
a
nonfan
of
dopplebocks
was
wow
this
is
not
overpowering
as
some
dopplebocks
can
be
the
color
was
very
dark
with
reddish
hues
the
smell
was
the
charecteristic
caramel
sweet
odour
when
i
took
my
first
drink
is
when
it
really
stood
apart
with
a
very
balanced
malty
caramel
taste
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
going
out
on
a
limb
feel
this
will
be
a
very
regular
beer
for
me
d
excellent
great
beer
for
having
a
couple
of
doppelbock
is
quickly
becoming
my
new
favorite
style
one
of
the
first
flavors
youll
taste
upon
first
sip
is
the
alcohol
which
is
almost
too
pronounced
but
the
maltiness
and
sweetness
of
this
beer
are
what
youll
remember
overall
the
smoothness
and
lack
of
bitterness
makes
this
beer
quite
drinkable
though
it
may
be
a
bit
too
sweet
and
malty
to
tackle
more
than
one
in
a
single
evening
needless
to
say
this
is
a
reasonably
priced
tasty
doppelbock
that
i
highly
recommend
d
i
think
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
too
pronounced
for
me
but
other
than
that
it
was
pretty
good
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
id
drink
it
again
sometime
i
would
say
its
drinkable
enough
to
sit
down
with
20
ounces
of
it
but
not
much
more
than
that
worth
a
try
drinkable
but
very
sweet
which
is
something
to
be
expected
from
a
double
bock
the
abv
doesnt
show
in
the
taste
at
all
very
good
beer
d
i
do
not
know
much
about
doppelbocks
but
this
beer
is
tasty
easy
to
drink
and
smooth
for
such
a
dark
beer
dark
brown
color
with
a
frothy
tancolored
head
sweet
toasted
and
caramelized
malt
nose
with
a
toffeeish
accent
brown
sugar
hint
of
dark
dried
fruits
fruitiness
in
the
aroma
follows
through
on
a
mediumbodied
palate
with
a
very
sweet
toasted
malt
character
with
some
brown
sugar
hint
of
nuttiness
dried
raisins
and
plums
fruitiness
leading
towards
a
rich
malty
finish
clear
dark
brown
with
one
finger
of
pale
tan
head
some
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
and
flowers
taste
is
very
sweet
caramel
molasses
some
fig
flavor
mouthfeel
is
good
with
some
warming
alcohol
on
the
center
of
the
tongue
really
close
to
a
winter
warmer
type
beer
drinkability
is
quite
good
but
one
would
be
enough
for
me
try
this
instead
of
brandy
after
a
meal
very
tasty
d
this
is
truly
a
great
drinking
beer
not
too
complex
but
it
will
mess
you
up
in
a
hurry
and
taste
great
doing
so
overall
it
was
not
a
great
beer
tasting
experience
i
would
have
loved
to
try
this
beer
on
tap
in
munich
i
believe
it
would
make
all
the
difference
while
some
others
may
not
appreciate
the
thinner
mouthfeel
and
lack
of
other
tastes
raisins
figs
i
find
it
very
drinkable
and
a
top
notch
example
of
style
dthis
is
a
darn
tasty
doppelbock
with
a
good
rich
flavor
profile
and
enough
of
a
hop
balance
and
light
alcohol
presence
that
make
for
a
tasty
rich
beer

poured
into

deep
ruby
to
russett
brown
dark

transparent
when
held
to
the
light
smell
is
of
dark
fruit
roasted

burnt

molasses
slight
booziness
and
bread
the
taste
is
raisins
and

to
start
then
a
slight

with
an
aftertaste
following
up
with
a
return
of
the
fruitiness
along
the
side
and

of
the

and
black
bread
with
a
slightly
smoky
quality
there
is
a
mediumheavy
body
and
wet
finish
to
this
very
good
doppelbock
one
is
enough
to
enjoy
thoroughly
drinkability
aftertaste
and
filling
nature
makes
this
one
hard
to
come
back
to
more
than
once
in
a
night
for
me
but
still
a
good
doppelbock
i
like
this
beer
despite
its
inbev
associations
i
find
myself
drinking
one
every
few
years
it
will
take
me
a
while
to
go
through
a
six
pack
of
this
as
the
beers
strength
limits
its
drinkability
over
an
evening
within
the
glass
i
take
it
slowly
because
of
the
strength
and
the
sweet
coat
this
is
a
beer
that
is
probably
available
in
your
area
if
you
are
unsure
about
doppelbocks
or
want
to
explore
german
beers
beyond
becks
this
is
a
good
one
to
try
solid
doppelbock
poured
to
a
one
finger
head
of
light
brown
color
with
a
velvet
like
head
the
head
was
not
long
lasting
evaporating
after
about
forty
seconds
the
lace
around
the
glass
is
thick
but
has
no
clinging
power
smells
like
nothing
discernable
just
a
little
sweet
flowery
aroma
oooo
the
taste
is
nothing
like
the
smell
reminds
me
of
licorice
something
like
jagermeister
but
missing
the
big
kick
color
is
a
29
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
but
the
color
is
not
reprehensive
of
the
flavor
the
flavor
is
rich
and
mellow
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
licorice
really
comes
through
with
a
wave
of
sweet
hops
there
is
very
little
bitterness
although
there
is
a
definite
flavor
or
hops
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
spend
hard
earned
cash
to
drink
d
not
the
most
complex
brew
but
how
complex
can
this
style
be
its
definitely
an
easy
drinker
due
to
the
malty
dominance
nothing
to
special
here
but
i
could
easily
buy
a
sixer
for
a
campfire
verdict
germans
know
beer
spaten
optimator
is
a
testament
to
that
i
tried
this
on
a
strangers
recommendation
a
few
months
ago
and
i
must
say
its
become
one
of
my
favorites
when
i
go
out
for
beers
i
typically
try
something
new
and
then
finish
off
with
something
i
know
i
like
this
has
become
a
frequent
finisher
for
me
if
you
havent
tried
optimator
then
youre
missing
out
seriously
this
is
one
of
those
beers
thats
so
good
that
it
makes
you
sad
when
you
find
your
glass
empty
on
a
side
note
this
beer
still
tastes
exquisite
out
of
a
bottle
some
beers
e
g
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
taste
much
better
from
a
tap
than
from
a
bottle
d
highly
drinkable
this
is
a
wintertime
warmer
and
a
beer
that
will
give
you
a
good
feeling
without
having
to
feel
full
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
it
was
sort
of
mellow
at
first
but
then
as
it
got
warmer
the
roasted
malts
really
came
through
i
could
easily
drink
a
6pck
of
this
stuff
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
autumn
beer
glad
i
tried
it
ive
been
wanting
to
explore
a
few
other
doppelbocks
and
ultimately
im
finding
it
is
a
style
i
dont
particularly
enjoy
despite
being
a
fan
of
malty
beers
too
thin
and
too
sweet
would
rather
spend
my
money
on
some
dirty
bastard
etc
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
deep
dark
orange
brown
with
very
little
head
and
light
carbonation
despite
the
head
and
carbonation
characteristics
it
remains
to
be
an
alluring
brew
although
there
is
little
carbonation
it
does
not
taste
flat
it
has
a
distinct
lush
prunelike
smell
with
hints
of
licorice
a
bitter
taste
but
not
overbearing
not
very
heavy
and
this
is
deceptive
because
you
will
feel
quite
a
nice
buzz
after
drinking
a
few
the
first
time
i
tried
this
beer
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
and
could
not
really
appreciate
it
upon
second
taste
i
rather
like
it
to
sum
it
up
i
would
say
it
has
good
multiple
personalities
like
a
beautiful
gothic
chick
you
are
just
getting
to
know
but
if
you
are
not
respectful
she
will
kick
your
ass
sweet
smell
and
taste
think
caramel
raisins
maybe
even
sugar
with
almost
no
hop
flavour
and
kick
which
i
dont
really
mind
as
long
as
the
taste
is
as
complex
as
here
extremely
drinkable
and
very
pleasant
i
like
it
very
much
for
those
of
you
that
like
full
bodied
beer
with
little
carbonation
then
this
beer
is
for
you
for
german
beers
this
is
probably
considered
an
average
this
balance
between
refreshment
character
is
a
revelation
here
though
pours
a
dark
ambercaramel
brown
smells
of
roasted
malt
caramel
molasses
and
just
a
hint
of
licorice
tastes
of
roasted
caramel
malt
brown
sugar
and
notes
of
fig
and
nut
very
smooth
wellbalanced
and
fullbodied
blessing
of
your
heart
you
brew
good
ale
in
this
case
strong
lager
shakesbeere
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
has
notes
of
caramel
with
some
dark
fruit
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
just
as
good
if
not
better
i
get
some
caramel
malts
bready
malts
grapes
dark
fruit
and
molasses
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
probably
one
of
my
favorite
doppelbocks
ive
tried
to
date
not
overly
sweet
or
aggressive
in
any
way
a
more
pf
a
tawny
dark
coca
cola
in
the
light
color
with
a
off
white
head
nice
and
frothy
and
somewhat
thick
but
not
as
thick
and
some
other
doppelbocks
ive
had
nose
is
toasty
almond
and
molasses
palate
is
where
it
should
be
with
a
particularly
sweet
quality
to
it
brown
sugar
almost
honey
with
definite
nutty
molasses
quality
easy
to
find
and
most
typical
of
drink
good
consistent
but
too
dessert
of
a
doppelbock
for
me
nice
abv
quality
not
a
trace
this
is
a
good
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
the
style
and
im
a
big
fan
of
this
brew
now
if
i
could
venture
to
munich
and
try
a
fresh
one
from
the
tap
d
the
alcohol
isnt
that
apparent
in
the
smell
or
taste
so
its
very
drinkable
although
im
not
sure
how
many
of
these
i
could
have
because
itls
very
filling
and
feels
like
you
are
having
a
meal
buy
again
yes
jd
taste
is
warm
like
a
brown
ale
aged
a
bit
this
may
have
been
unintentionally
thankfully
doesnt
have
the
rubbing
alcohol
feel
of
a
lot
of
doppelbocks
has
something
prickly
to
it
maybe
not
hops
or
those
euro
hops
i
dont
have
too
often
a
nice
subtlety
mouthfeel
too
thin
to
get
to
into
it
and
neither
is
the
price
poured
a
dark
mahogany
brown
with
a
one
fingered
offwhite
head
sweet
malty
aromas
with
hints
of
carmel
and
brown
sugar
taste
as
it
smelled
with
a
boozy
finish
that
wasnt
over
bearing
nice
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
desent
enough
brew
with
a
nice
clean
finish
definitely
an
enjoyable
doppelbock
d
average
i
could
maybe
have
2
of
these
a
good
beer
across
the
board
nothing
truly
exceptional
but
easy
drinking
and
inexpensive
to
boot
i
was
initially
unimpressed
with
this
beer
but
over
the
past
few
days
my
opinion
has
improved
somewhat
pours
out
with
a
great
head
which
dissipates
fairly
quickly
emits
a
subtle
almost
apologetic
typically
german
odor
color
is
dark
but
not
thick
flavor
ranges
from
tolerable
to
delicious
cant
really
decide
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
then
again
maybe
i
would
i
cant
really
decide
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
doppelbock
that
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
and
provides
an
easy
sipping
beverage
for
a
relaxing
night
i
kinda
wanna
try
this
on
tap
to
see
if
the
flavor
is
a
bit
different
either
way
another
solid
offer
from
the
bavarian
folks
at
spaten
this
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
german
beers
and
the
latest
tasting
bore
that
out
rjt
body
is
surprisingly
thin
carb
is
appropriate
and
as
it
is
thin
and
not
terribly
high
in
alcohol
it
is
reasonably
drinkable
the
best
thing
that
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
a
looker
but
that
isnt
enough
for
me
to
buy
it
again
goes
down
pretty
easy
could
be
a
good
spring
or
fall
drink
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
parchment
head
that
fades
quickly
but
leaves
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
plenty
of
brown
sugar
toffee
and
toasty
notes
as
well
as
a
slight
nuttiness
flavor
is
also
very
malty
but
is
balanced
out
well
with
a
burnt
sugar
character
and
some
bitterness
plenty
of
brown
sugar
toffee
and
some
fruity
sweet
notes
as
well
more
herbal
hops
than
i
had
expected
but
they
are
still
far
in
the
back
ground
i
find
that
this
beer
lacks
a
bit
of
the
doppelbock
punch
you
usually
get
and
while
good
it
is
a
bit
subdued
the
body
is
on
the
fuller
side
of
medium
and
is
fairly
sticky
one
of
the
most
drinkable
doppelbocks
i
have
had
but
not
the
most
exciting
this
is
my
first
german
munich
and
i
am
very
impressed
almost
like
a
brown
ale
but
smoother
and
cleaner
pours
a
nice
deep
copper
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
spreads
to
the
sides
quikly
mouth
feel
is
very
nice
and
nice
carmal
taste
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
fruit
this
beer
pours
out
a
dark
brown
with
very
little
off
white
head
and
even
this
little
bit
dissipates
rather
quickly
lots
of
malt
and
caramel
scents
come
off
of
this
beer
as
well
as
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
which
fortunately
stays
mostly
in
the
background
this
beer
tastes
very
malty
and
to
a
lesser
degree
has
some
caramel
flavor
to
it
the
mouthfeel
for
this
one
is
pretty
good
not
as
heavy
as
youd
expect
from
a
beer
at
this
abv
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
thin
by
a
long
shot
the
main
reason
i
think
this
beer
suffers
is
because
its
high
abv
impairs
its
drinkability
somewhat
while
tasty
this
isnt
a
beer
youre
going
to
sit
down
and
drink
through
a
six
pack
ok
just
a
bit
about
it
it
is
dark
rich
and
sweet
if
you
want
dry
and
bitter
look
elsewhere
this
one
will
pair
with
a
nice
dessert
or
just
about
anything
as
far
as
im
concerned
yes
it
does
get
better
as
it
approaches
room
temperature
but
i
havent
made
it
all
the
way
there
because
it
tastes
too
damn
good
enjoy
and
only
rate
it
if
you
can
appreciate
a
truly
damn
good
doppelbock
drink
up
boys
and
girls
future
outlook
good
if
unspectacular
beer
i
wont
seek
it
out
but
i
wont
run
if
handed
another
one
of
these
d
good
to
drink
with
dinner
not
a
chuggin
beer
by
any
means
east
drinking
so
long
as
you
serve
it
warm
enough
easily
drinkable
dopplebocks
light
enough
to
drink
but
heavy
enough
to
be
one
to
be
aware
of
the
abv
not
bad
for
my
first
dopplebock
drinkability
this
is
easily
drinkable
and
a
good
companion
to
a
game
burger
but
i
probably
wont
make
a
point
of
having
more
i
would
not
turn
it
down
if
offered
but
on
the
whole
id
prefer
to
seek
out
others
that
are
just
as
readily
available
e
g
celebrator
st
victorious
smooth
hoperator
etc
d
one
of
the
more
drinkable
doppelbocks
i
have
had
you
can
take
big
plugs
at
it
and
do
just
fine
great
atmosphere
appearance
is
very
solid
dark
and
rich
with
a
nice
full
head
nose
is
a
great
combination
of
sweet
but
not
overly
so
components
flavor
is
malty
with
subtle
sweetness
but
not
enough
to
deduct
from
the
roasted
malty
goodness
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
d
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
it
lacks
the
meal
in
a
bottle
quality
that
i
expect
from
a
really
good
doppelbock
though
cleaner
than
most
dbocks
it
lacks
complexity
and
big
beer
feel
overall
a
nice
easy
to
drink
doppelbock
its
not
my
favorite
but
its
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
style
so
it
has
my
respect
id
be
more
than
willing
to
drink
this
again
although
i
think
if
given
the
choice
id
go
for
a
salvator
before
this
overall
very
good
a
decent
version
of
the
style
simple
but
full
of
flavor
a
good
one
to
try
if
you
are
getting
into
doppelbocks
and
cheap
too
i
bought
this
as
a
1
80
single
drinkability
this
could
get
ugly
for
anyone
without
selfcontrol
but
its
supersmooth
and
drinkability
is
barnone
this
could
definitely
sneak
up
on
the
unsuspecting
due
to
warming
and
lightsweet
finish
great
flavor
again
strong
on
the
malt
slighty
sweet
very
slight
coffee
hint
medium
bodied
with
quite
a
kick
a
little
strong
for
a
session
beer
but
a
great
choice
for
the
style
this
is
a
delicious
doppelbock
it
is
well
and
truly
named
bocks
and
doppelbocks
are
quickly
becoming
my
favorite
styles
what
with
such
good
examples
to
represent
them
i
would
drink
this
any
day
of
the
week
this
is
my
fiances
first
review
ever
i
think
she
did
damn
well
oh
why
oh
why
would
they
serve
this
is
a
20oz
pint
glass
this
was
a
fantastically
refreshing
doppelbock
that
yours
truly
overindulged
in
true
to
the
style
it
is
dark
and
beautiful
nothing
amazing
about
the
taste
or
aroma
but
both
are
what
you
would
expect
from
a
doppelbock
the
alcohol
content
is
nicely
masked
by
a
smooth
texture
that
can
sneak
up
on
you
very
quickly
this
beer
is
extremely
light
for
a
doppelbock
and
should
be
critiqued
as
such
it
seems
that
many
reviewers
are
expecting
a
dark
intense
and
brooding
beer
if
that
were
spatens
goal
i
would
concur
that
it
fails
this
beer
approximates
the
mouthfeel
appearance
and
some
of
the
flavor
profile
of
a
dunkel
i
happen
to
love
dunkels
so
given
the
very
low
price
and
high
availability
i
will
be
buying
more
d
this
lager
has
good
flavor
but
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
or
2
of
these
because
of
the
sweetness
d
this
beer
finishes
real
sweet
as
it
should
but
combine
it
with
7
2
and
its
not
exactly
a
session
beer
it
is
really
good
though
the
only
part
that
missed
the
mark
for
me
was
the
mouth
feel
i
would
have
liked
to
see
a
fuller
a
body
out
of
a
beer
with
just
a
high
starting
gravity
i
gotta
say
im
kind
of
disappointed
with
this
one
not
as
strong
as
i
thought
it
would
be
overall
a
pretty
good
dopplebock
the
drinkability
is
fantastic
not
too
high
in
alcohol
that
you
can
not
have
a
couple
enough
flavors
to
keep
the
tongue
guessing
at
ever
turn
mixed
with
the
lightness
of
a
lager
i
will
definitely
purchase
this
again
an
underwhelming
doppelbock
but
also
a
little
bit
confounding
it
promises
some
deep
malt
and
doesnt
deliver
so
i
want
to
hate
this
beer
then
again
the
dark
fruit
character
to
the
taste
is
occasionally
very
nice
and
near
the
end
of
the
bottle
some
of
the
sips
are
wholly
enjoyable
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
give
to
someone
who
likes
things
like
harp
lager
because
it
has
significantly
more
flavor
than
stellaharpbmcetc
at
the
same
time
everything
this
beer
does
well
is
done
better
by
another
beer
and
not
that
well
done
by
optimator
pretty
thick
mouthfeel
on
the
optimator
drinkable
but
in
moderation
i
was
able
to
drink
an
entire
bottle
this
time
for
me
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
throughout
a
hearty
winter
meal
in
my
case
lentil
spent
home
brew
grain
and
sausage
stew
this
is
a
solid
german
doppelbock
that
i
think
is
worth
revisiting
during
the
cold
months
drinkability
goes
up
to
4
spaten
optimaor
is
a
dark
ruby
red
that
has
brown
blotches
not
much
as
even
a
cap
even
off
of
the
tap
just
some
faint
squigglies
smells
is
dark
fruit
plum
pear
roast
big
malts
caramel
and
toffee
the
taste
is
the
same
but
maybe
not
in
the
above
order
its
very
sweet
and
carameltofee
rich
too
much
for
my
liking
the
feel
is
syrupy
and
above
medium
and
it
reminded
me
of
fresh
mad
elf
from
the
tap
sweet
and
a
bit
cloying
drinkability
was
low
a
nice
big
meaty
beer
drinkability
suffers
due
to
the
viscosity
and
sweetness
but
the
size
of
the
beer
does
a
good
job
of
masking
the
not
insignificant
alcohol
d
easy
to
drink
and
it
doesnt
even
feel
that
warming
drinkability
this
is
one
thick
and
heavy
beer
one
is
enough
this
is
a
straightforward
malt
bomb
with
no
other
flavorscomplexity
to
note
of
one
is
definitely
enough
but
this
isnt
exactly
a
style
to
session
solid
beer
d
a
filling
beer
to
say
the
least
like
eating
a
meal
d
good
stuff
pairs
well
works
in
any
situation
d
this
is
my
goto
doppel
it
may
not
be
the
best
but
it
is
damn
close
and
a
good
bit
cheaper
too
a
classic
example
of
the
style
poured
into
a
chalice
with
only
one
finger
head
that
was
tan
colors
a
deep
dark
brown
with
ruby
hints
aromas
are
faint
and
malty
tastes
malty
in
general
a
light
chocolate
flavor
followed
with
some
very
faint
fruitiness
and
alcohol
spiciness
feels
good
on
the
palate
with
a
light
tickling
of
carbonation
and
an
oily
finish
overall
a
nice
drinkable
beer
tech
stuff
i
guess
solid
pour

typical
dark
beerale
flavors
probably
would
be
a
favorite
in
the
real
beer
drinker
country
of
germany
pours
dark
brown
with
reddish
highlights
left
a
one
finger
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
no

not
too
much
smell
smells
a
lot
like
any
other
spaten
ive
had
taste
is
very
pleasant
roasty
malty
dried
fruits
i
can
almost
taste
some
raisin
and
ginger
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
a
little
thick
hardly
any
carbonation
drinkability
is
way
up
there
since
this
is
such
a
pleasant
beer
its
very
inviting
i
also
need
to
point
out
that
the
labels
calls
this
a
malt
liquor
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
right
up
there
with
the
oe
800
medium
bodied
and
fairly
drinkable
dont
notice
much
of
the
7
2
overall
a
pretty
decent
dobbelbock
pours
a
dark
brown
slightly
opaque
with
hints
of
red
offwhite
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
pretty
much
just
malt
taste
brings
a
bit
more
to
the
table
but
not
much
slight
hints
of
caramel
or
nuttiness
all
in
all
both
taste
and
aroma
are
a
bit
weak
theyre
not
bad
but
not
particularly
interesting
mouthfeel
is
likewise
underwhelming
too
thin
carbonation
is
okay
but
a
bit
more
might
help
drinkability
is
good
d
nice
beer
not
as
complex
as
some
celebrator
but
hits
the
style
well
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
for
the
style
but
there
are
certainly
betters
out
there
worth
a
shot
full
bodied
some
tinge
of
bitter
in
there
but
mostly
sweet
and
a
slight
darker
malt
almost
schwartz
character
drinkability
high
and
mouthfeel
is
great
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
and
a
great
experience
i
reviewed
this
on
draft
and
in
the
bottle
now
both
great
ways
to
drink
overall
good
beer
not
the
one
id
go
for
every
day
cheers
after
her
scent
of
seduction
her
smooth
almost
doughy
malt
sweetness
that
tingles
on
the
tongue
right
before
taking
over
your
soul
missing
that
rough
bitterness
of
domestic
hops
there
is
something
romantic
about
an
authentic
european
style
beer
almost
like
drinking
wine
if
you
do
that
sort
of
thing
which
i
do
not
d
very
drinkable
flavor
is
good
not
great
but
its
nicely
quaffable
not
many
dopplebocks
where
you
can
put
down
more
than
one
and
the
optimator
is
one
of
the
few
drinkability
very
drinkable
for
a
7
2
smooth
not
too
sweet
or
heavy
d
i
dont
think
taste
would
be
a
hindrance
at
all
to
drinkability
malty
sweet
stuff
tends
to
go
down
easy
for
me
but
i
do
tend
to
watch
myself
on
higher
alcohol
stuff
and
thats
where
this
ceases
to
be
a
good
session
beer
a
nice
example
of
a
doppelbock
sweetness
and
slightly
strong
alcohol
task
keep
me
from
drinking
this
every
day
poured
from
a
green
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
a
bit
sweet
and
malty
a
bit
bready
taste
is
also
bready
sweet
lots
of
malts
very
easy
drinking
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
worth
checking
out
d
only
thing
keeping
this
from
being
hugely
drinkable
is
the
sweetness
becomes
somewhat
overwhelming
after
a
bit
otherwise
a
great
and
slightly
unique
doppelbock
this
is
my
second
dopplebockthe
other
being
salvator
i
think
im
in
love
the
taste
blows
me
away
on
this
cold
winters
day
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
ones
the
germans
are
true
masters
of
their
craft
wonder
what
it
would
be
like
to
try
one
in
badtolz
or
munich
this
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
that
recedes
to
very
fine
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
a
bit
of
caramel
in
the
nose
as
well
maybe
a
bit
of
fruit
esters
from
the
yeast
the
taste
improves
upon
the
nose
with
the
caramel
and
roasted
malt
flavor
very
well
developed
and
complimented
nicely
by
the
bavarian
yeast
esters
the
full
body
and
smooth
carbonation
are
good
for
the
style
a
petty
drinkable
doppelbock
another
nice
quality
german
brew
d
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
with
its
overall
heaviness
awesome
winter
beer
nice
blackbrown
color
with
a
tan
head
leaves
good
lacing
medium
thick
and
it
hangs
around
for
a
few
before
sliding
down
the
chalice
first
thing
about
the
nose
is
its
very
sweet
and
nutty
reminds
me
of
dinkel
acker
lots
of
almonds
and
molasses
in
the
nose
with
a
creamy
sweet
maltball
character
the
taste
offers
more
candied
nut
flavor
like
brown
sugar
coated
pecans
roasted
almonds
and
lots
of
maple
syrup
very
malty
up
front
and
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
anywhere
walnuts
drowned
in
molasses
in
the
finish
and
a
little
shot
of
dark
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
thickness
and
even
though
it
wasnt
over
carbonated
the
size
of
the
bubbles
gave
it
feel
like
a
soda
pop
somewhat
dry
for
the
style
good
example
and
an
old
school
classic
di
cant
have
too
many
of
these
bc
of
the
alcohol
content
and
the
level
of
sweetness
from
the
malts
i
will
definitely
put
this
in
line
with
korbinian
and
bajuvator
d
high
drinkability
holds
itself
as
a
heavy
beer
but
several
can
be
enjoyed
in
a
single
evening
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
no
l18091f
sampled
on
november

2009
this
has
a
richly
dark
mahogany
brown
pour
with
a
thin
beige
head
and
above
average
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
nice
following
of
hops
on
the
last
sniff
medium
mouthfeel
the
taste
has
a
fine
roasted
malt
sensation
maybe
a
little
molasses
and
a
moderate
but
pleasing
hoppy
ending
an
easy
to
drink
draker
beer
despite
its
7
2
abv
d
i
definitely
could
not
drink
this
all
night
however
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
drink
by
the
fire
or
for
a
nightcap
this
beer
is
rich
flavorful
and
a
true
winter
beer
nay
classic
the
flavors
are
harsh
and
heavy
i
feel
like
it
needs
a
bit
more
of
the
bubbles
to
break
things
up
the
foam
was
wheat
in
color
bubbly
thick
smooth
and
left
a
ring
around
the
glass
til
the
end
the
color
was
a
dark
burgandyall
most
black
with
an
orange
red
highlight
in
the
light
the
smell
of
roasted
barley
and
hints
of
chocolate
and
raisons
and
a
fruity
undertone
it
had
a
very
robust
taste
with
a
variety
of
flavors
like
roasted
barley
hints
of
chocolate
and
fruity
accents
the
mouthfeel
semiviscous
and
rich
drinkability
nice
and
rich
im
a
great
fan
of
the
dark
beers
drinkability
this
stuff
is
pretty
tasty
to
me
but
it
is
a
little
bit
of
a
onenote
song
ok
a
twonote
songmalt
and
pearsbut
you
get
the
idea
ill
finish
this
one
gladly
but
its
a
little
sweet
and
monotonous
to
session
d
honestly
its
a
stretch
for
me
to
put
down
more
than
two
of
these
just
a
once
in
a
while
beer
for
me
two
thumbs
up
for
spatens
optimator
drinkability
very
drinkable
but
defiantly
on
the
heavy
side
im
not
going
to
be
playing
much
beer
pong
with
this
one
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
tried
good
caramel
taste
not
bad
very
good
to
go
with
beef
or
perhaps
a
good
meaty
stew
nice
winter
beer
good
and
heavy
actually
would
like
to
drink
this
one
more
i
am
trying
the
one
pint
nine
oz
bottle
not
bad
will
try
again
but
in
a
smaller
bottle
been
on
the
doppelbock
tip
lately
and
this
one
definitely
doesnt
disappoint
great
big
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
malt
character
w
hints
of
caramel
its
medium
bodied
that
fringes
on
full
the
drinkablity
is
a
little
better
than
average
for
the
style
its
definitely
no
celebrator
but
worth
drinking
again
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
it
is
pretty
crisp
while
cold
and
as
it
warms
up
more
licorice
comes
out
and
it
becomes
a
bit
more
sticky
so
maybe
not
an
all
night
beer
another
reason
for
this
as
with
most
doppelbocks
is
that
it
is
higher
in
alcohol
and
is
something
that
could
sneak
up
on
you
in
just
a
few
beers
so
enjoy
but
watch
out
this
aint
a
twizzler
moderately
carbonated
in
the
mouthfeel
very
tasty
and
drinkable
well
made
brew
d
drinkable
but
heavy
also
abv
is
high
but
alcohol
is
not
felt
at
all
mouth
is
somewhat
watery
and
beer
is
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
this
is
one
smoooth
doppelbock
creamy
toffee
and
caramel
maltiness
just
glides
through
the
mouth
and
down
the
hatch
the
fruit
that
was
so
readily
apparent
in
the
nose
fades
to
barely
a
whisper
in
the
flavor
some
warming
alcohol
makes
an
appearance
in
the
finish
this
is
a
tremendously
drinkable
and
flavorful
doppelbock
there
is
always
room
for
some
optimator
in
my
fridge
pours
a
great
deep
brown
nearly
black
color
with
very
nice
head
and
lacing
nice
deep
scent
very
sweet
and
malty
with
a
slight
coffee
aroma
great
taste
a
wonderfully
thick
dark
and
strong
malt
flavor
no
real
bitterness
great
for
a
doppelbock
went
down
great
no
notice
of
the
high
abv
a
great
thick
and
dark
beer
just
a
shade
below
full
bodied
with
perfect
carbonation
a
very
thick
lush
mouthfeel
big
fan
of
this
component
d
love
it
and
could
easily
kill
several
in
one
session
although
i
was
shocked
to
see
the
abv
in
the
7s
overall
a
bit
too
roasted
even
charred
in
a
brown
sugar
sense
in
the
background
but
has
ample
malts
to
balance
things
decent
not
stellar
i
put
this
on
up
with
celebrator
and
aventinus
it
tastes
a
lot
similar
to
a
sam
adams
winter
lager
it
is
a
good
hearty
beer
and
is
recommended
for
cooler
temperaturesseasons
it
drinks
as
a
fairly
heavy
beer
although
its
appearance
is
like
a
guinness
it
has
a
better
drinkability
id
give
it
a
solid
b
or
b
a
great
beer
for
novices
and
connoisseurs
alike
give
it
a
go
pours
a
beautiful
amber
mahogany
color
with
a
quickly
fading
head
the
color
reminds
me
of
a
traditional
dark
wood
pub
and
is
just
as
inviting
lots
of
sweet
malt
on
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
roasted
aroma
sweet
malt
flavor
is
met
first
quickly
followed
by
bitter
roasted
malt
and
subtle
hops
and
finishes
slightly
dry
with
nice
postnasal
malt
aroma
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
silky
just
enough
thickness
to
match
the
malt
strength
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
would
recommend
to
a
malt
lover
drinkability
very
drinkable
smooth
beer
for
high
abv
as
fall
begins
and
the
nights
grow
cooler
optimator
is
the
perfect
companion
for
a
relaxing
night
out
on
the
patio
listening
to
the
wind
rustle
the
leaves
the
wonderful
scent
from
neighborhood
fireplaces
permeating
the
air
d
delicious
and
does
not
really
betray
its
high
alcohol
content
definitely
good
drinkability
overall
a
very
solid
offering
probably
not
my
favorite
dopplebock
but
definitely
recommended
for
fans
of
the
style
this
is
my
favorite
doppelbock
to
date
and
my
favorite
brew
from
spaten
na
zdravje
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
smooth
but
not
cloying
its
not
really
a
sipper
i
could
go
through
three
or
four
of
these
if
my
better
judgment
didnt
prevail
drinkability
you
wont
pound
a
six
pack
of
these
this
is
a
very
filling
beer
but
delicious
on
the
way
down
full
flavored
id
recommend
it
highly
a
medium
body
and
sweetness
makes
this
very
smooth
overall
good
but
not
great
best
in
winter
very
heavy
for
a
hot
summer
dayevening
d
i
have
had
better
double
bocks
but
this
one
is
still
really
good
if
you
just
want
one
cause
it
fills
your
belly
ha
ha
this
is
a
solid
doppelbock
very
drinkable
worth
giving
a
try
d
a
doppelbocks
go
this
one
is
very
drinkable
it
is
one
that
i
would
definitely
enjoy
again
d
pretty
high
given
the
abv
you
taste
a
bit
of
the
alcohol
but
for
the
most
part
this
is
just
pure
warmth
and
easy
to
down
overall
this
is
a
very
good
dopplebock
and
a
fine
example
this
beer
is
always
good
when
i
dont
know
what
to
buy
the
abv
is
extremely
well
hidden
however
this
is
a
pretty
heavy
beer
for
the
style
a
slow
drinker
with
wonderful
complexity
the
7
2
abv
is
well
hidden
in
the
sip
but
it
is
effective
in
warming
the
stomach
overall
this
beer
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
i
have
no
problem
putting
down
a
couple
d
ok
d
excellent
pure
german
double
bock
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
and
it
came
out
a
nice
reddish
brown
color
with
a
deep
head
aromas
of
mostly
brown
sugar
and
some
hops
very
smooth
in
the
taste
with
chocolate
brown
sugar
and
very
light
caramel
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
it
ends
nicely
with
the
typical
spaten
bitternes
with
a
very
light
metallic
aftertaste
very
nice
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
body
with
a
decent
bubbly
head
smells
malty
caramel
biscuit
a
hint
of
fruit
sweetness
taste
has
excelent
balance
the
malt
and
alcohol
are
both
present
just
at
oposite
ends
if
the
flavor
timeline
caramel
and
toasty
malt
the
hops
are
hard
to
pickout
mouth
feel
is
oily
and
thick
drinkability
is
high
because
it
hides
the
alcohol
well
but
too
heavy
and
too
potent
for
a
sesion
beer
cheers
d
a
little
too
vinous
for
my
taste
i
think
i
would
aim
more
in
the
direction
of
a
less
estery
dopplebock
in
the
future
drinkability
excellent
notes
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
doppelbock
also
this
is
the
only
euro
imported
beer
i
have
seen
that
is
12oz
and
not
11
2oz
mouthfeel
was
crisp
yet
smooth
easy
drinker
flavor
was
of
sweet
caramel
toffee
some
coffee
cake
fresh
dark
breads
and
finished
sweet
as
well
this
is
a
very
good
doppel
but
may
be
too
sweet
for
some
i
for
one
enjoyed
it
the
nose
is
deceiving
on
this
one
behind
the
lame
fragrance
lies
a
superb
brew
that
changes
as
it
travels
towards
room
temperature
the
warmer
it
gets
the
more
pronounced
and
complimentary
the
fruit
flavors
get
the
optimator
is
a
tasty
brew
worth
your
attention
d
still
a
relatively
full
beer
that
can
put
a
hurting
on
you
one
is
enough
for
me

and

to

an

beer
this
is
at
the
currently
point
in
time
my
favorite
beer
right
now
and
its
a
joy
to
bring
a
6pack
of
it
to
a
friends
place
and
watch
them
enjoy
it
as
well
drinkability
very
drinkable
very
smooth
going
down
this
is
very
drinkable
no
offensive
flavors
d
even
with
the
high
abv
i
find
myself
wanting
to
chug
these
once
the
abv
sets
in
a
bit
i
am
able
to
slow
down
might
be
best
to
alternate
with
a
less
abvs
if
you
like
to
pound
beers
like
myself
poured
into
a
chimay
goblet
smells
faintly
of
alcohol
strong
sweet
malt
some
caramel
and
maybe
a
little
like
some
kind
of
dark
fruit
it
tastes
huge
and
malty
theres
a
lot
of
sweet
sugary
flavors
that
sort
of
coat
the
tongue
hop
bitterness
is
understated
but
there
maybe
is
a
bit
of
hop
flavor
rounding
it
out
optimator
is
one
of
my
favorites
its
a
nice
standard
doppel
that
can
be
found
on
tap
in
a
lot
of
places
drinkability
i
can
see
why
a
doppelbock
is
referred
to
as
a
meal
in
a
glass
its
much
more
filling
than
your
average
beer
but
also
extremely
satisfying
to
drink
its
more
of
a
sipping
beer
but
its
very
smooth
i
love
the
taste
but
will
only
drink
one
of
these
due
to
the
7
2
abv
couldnt
drink
this
all
night
unless
i
planned
on
staying
at
the
restaurant
goes
great
with
hot
dogs
with
mustard
its
a
very
dark
brown
opaque
theres
just
a
litle
bit
of
brown
visible
at
the
lower
edges
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
pequliar
sort
of
a
cherry
not
strong
but
not
definitive
the
taste
was
the
same
light
cherry
with
possible
mollases
added
in
the
body
was
heavy
but
not
offensive
if
you
are
going
for
a
heavy
beer
this
one
is
a
good
choice
however
i
would
not
recommend
getting
a
boot
full
of
this
at
hessen
haus
overall
a
great
find
and
certainly
worth
the
price
definitely
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
i
have
had
so
far
drinkability
is
good
dispite
it
becoming
a
touch
cloying
when
it
approaches
room
temp
its
not
you
typical
doppelbock
its
a
little
fruitier
and
one
gets
the
feeling
that
the
malts
in
this
one
are
on
average
roasted
a
bit
less
than
your
usual
doppelbock
but
its
still
a
solid
beer
that
is
always
sure
to
please
especially
on
tap
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
good
carbonation
and
nice
white
head
nose
is
faint
munich
malts
grainy
unimpressive
taste
is
much
better
than
nose
leads
you
to
believe
nice
heavy
chewy
malty
and
tastes
of
munich
and
maybe
crystal
malts
caramel
brown
sugar
maybe
syrup
dried
prunes
figs
and
raisins
perhaps
mouthfeel
is
coating
and
good
deep
brown
color
sudsy
head
lacing
smells
like
honey
covered
oats
honey
wheat
bread
smells
very
good
the
flavor
is
full
on
malts
possibly
fruity
raisins
bready
overall
this
is
a
decent
dopple
but
it
smells
a
lot
better
than
it
tastes
but
who
can
complain
for
2
49
mouthfeeldrinkability
seems
light
and
slick
in
the
mouth
i
love
how
it
lingers
on
the
taste
buds
not
a
bad
dopplebock
overall
especially
for
the
price
solid
but
nothing
special
i
would
buy
it
again
i
could
drink
more
of
these
than
any
other
version
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
so
far
very
nice
beer
full
flavored
and
nice
full
mouthfeel
thick
malt
a
bit
nutty
and
chewy
some
toasty
grain
not
much
hop
punch
to
be
found
this
brew
is
tostyle
perhaps
a
bit
on
the
light
side
but
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
wants
to
try
a
dopplebock
in
a
way
it
is
a
bit
pedestrian
for
a
db
but
its
just
so
smooth
and
balanced
that
i
would
consider
it
the
epitome
of
the
style
id
go
back
to
reviewing
this
on
draft
out
of
a
liter
tankard
the
bottle
doesnt
seem
to
be
near
as
good
to
me
drinkability
it
all
comes
together
to
be
quite
drinkable
a
seemingly
sneekily
perfect
finish
classic
noble
hop
ballance
mischieviously
slick
for
7
2
abv
medium
bodied
light
and
silky
very
smooth
very
good
drinkability
i
would
say
this
is
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
and
anyone
who
claims
to
love
bocks
would
love
this
beer
d
because
of
the
higher
alcohol
content
i
couldnt
pound
these
back
all
night
also
the
sweetness
is
great
for
afterdinner
or
for
one
or
two
but
would
be
cloying
after
more
than
that
this
beer
is
amazing
in
small
doses
but
it
loses
its
luster
after
more
than
two
or
three
note
i
think
i
need
to
try
this
on
tap
d
easy
to
drink
and
worth
a
try
for
sure
im
surprised
optimator
doesnt
rate
higher
with
ba
d
i
would
definitely
have
another
and
im
generally
an
ale
person
d
good
drinkability
for
a
big
beer
a
definite
savoring
style
drinkability
a
couple
is
about
the
drinking
limit
due
to
higher
abv
nice
while
they
last
though
a
fine
german
bier
notes
again
i
am
partial
to
optimator
since
it
was
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
off
of
bmc
it
challenged
me
to
consider
higher
quality
beers
and
taught
me
that
beer
can
have
a
taste
worth
seeking
out
prost
d
for
a
fuller
bodied
beer
its
somewhat
drinkable
but
its
thickness
and
sweetness
knock
this
guy
down
a
few
pegs
overall
very
good
and
very
drinkable
all
in
all
a
fairly
decent
dopplebock
not
my
favorite
and
not
the
most
exciting
but
definitely
a
solid
example
that
doesnt
really
have
any
major
faults
per
se
if
optimator
was
one
of
the
only
options
id
go
with
it
in
a
hearbeat
not
one
id
drink
regularly
but
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
down
overall
this
is
very
nice
well
balanced
and
easy
to
enjoy
ill
def
have
this
again
perhaps
after
i
finish
this
one
lol
d
highly
drinkable
no
alcohol
picked
up
lots
of
good
flavor
a
solid
beer
is
how
i
would
describe
it
poured
into
my
trusted
12oz
glass
forming
a
1
tan
head
over
a
dark
amber
body
reminiscent
of
maple
syrup
loads
of
visible
carbonation
and
the
head
fades
to
a
light
lacing
on
the
glass
and
a
bit
around
the
outside
of
the
liquid
the
smell
has
bread
roasted
grains
caramel
or
toffee
and
bit
of
nuts
and
fruitplums
mixed
with
a
light
presence
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
sweet
and
full
of
grains
and
caramel
up
front
a
slight
earthy
bitterness
and
then
a
medicinelike
alcohol
and
fruitnut
finish
quite
dry
and
a
lingering
of
alcohol
and
the
earthy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
not
quite
chewy
but
almost
very
full
and
this
seems
to
almost
stick
to
your
teeth
ill
give
this
a
high
rating
on
drinkability
though
not
because
youd
want
to
down
several
of
these
at
a
sitting
but
because
its
a
beer
to
look
forward
to
having
and
enjoying
slowly
after
work
or
such
mouth
is
viscous
and
creamy
just
like
any
doppelbock
the
drinkability
is
minimal
i
dont
think
i
could
keep
drinking
this
for
a
extended
period
of
time
good
but
not
great
overall
it
was
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
highly
recommend
it
is
smooth
tastes
malty
almost
bready
and
a
little
sweet
barely
carbonated
and
looks
and
smells
as
good
as
it
tastes
solid
one
of
the
best
dopplebocks
available
almost
black
with
pretty
ruby
highlights
strong
sweet
malt
aroma
same
for
the
flavor
also
hard
candy
sweeeet
candy
and
some
dark
fruits
smooth
and
fullbodied
any
easy
drinker
if
i
am
at
scholz
garden
this
is
my
go
to
beer
in
my
opinion
spaten
optimator
is
the
best
high
alcohol
beer
in
most
stores
it
is
usually
not
expensive
and
can
be
found
at
almost
any
convienience
store
the
dark
thick
beer
in
the
green
bottle
gives
it
a
very
distinct
taste
i
have
alot
of
good
memories
of
drinking
spaten
optimator
perfect
for
the
person
who
wants
to
mix
it
up
from
their
selection
of
normal
regular
beers
cheers
drinkability
i
would
rate
this
as
high
for
drinkability
the
clean
crisp
refreshing
quality
of
this
beer
makes
it
incredibly
drinkable
and
digestible
not
the
best
of
its
style
but
certainly
shows
amazing
use
of
malt
as
the
secret
ingredient
and
how
sweet
and
luscious
can
translate
into
a
sessionable
beer
drinkability
i
gotta
say
this
is
one
my
first
beers
i
started
getting
more
into
after
only
originally
know
american
macros
but
i
really
do
think
this
beer
is
underrated
i
think
its
a
really
good
example
of
its
style
and
an
amazing
beer
to
drink
its
sweet
malty
and
delicious
its
alcohol
being
high
is
slightly
noticeable
though
still
hidden
enough
to
be
very
enjoyably
drinkable
this
is
one
i
look
forward
to
visiting
ocasianally
when
i
feel
the
need
for
a
break
from
the
usual
lighter
beers
hoppy
beers
or
the
wheat
beers
a
beer
i
am
glad
to
have
in
my
rotation
and
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
one
i
think
i
will
always
enjoy
even
compared
to
the
others
i
have
tried
of
the
style
i
still
come
back
for
more
optimator
i
really
like
this
one
its
even
better
because
its
so
easy
to
find
underrated
in
my
opinion
thick
and
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
not
the
most
drinkable
doppelbock
for
me
this
one
isnt
bad
by
any
means
but
compared
to
many
others
optimator
just
doesnt
hold
up
d
a
really
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
you
could
drink
alot
of
these
if
the
7
2
abv
didnt
eventually
catch
up
with
you
out
of
the
doppelbocks
from
germany
that
ive
tried
this
is
my
least
favorite
as
well
as
my
least
favorite
offering
from
the
spaten
brewery
it
doesnt
have
the
strong
maltiness
of
salvator
bajuvator
or
korbinian
it
doesnt
have
the
complexity
of
celebrator
or
andechser
its
not
horrible
but
there
are
way
better
doppelbocks
and
starkbiers
out
there
average
drinkability
pours
a
medium
to
dark
reddish
brown
big
tan
head
lasting
very
sweet
malty
aroma
wood
and
toffee
grape
juice
but
not
very
strong
an
aroma
taste
of
some
coffee
chocolate
and
grape
juice
effervescent
not
heavy
like
i
thought
good
the
head
was
about
half
an
inch
thick
it
quickly
shrank
to
about
a
quarter
a
thickness
which
it
maintained
throughout
the
session
one
word
or
name
rather
came
to
mind
when
i
gazed
upon
this
german
genius
cocacola
yes
its
that
dark
lovely
colour
of
nonalcoholic
american
deliciousness
once
i
plunged
my
nose
deep
into
the
glassware
memories
of
my
grandmothers
kitchen
came
to
mind
as
the
distinct
smell
of
vegetable
soup
came
from
this
beer
the
optimator
carried
a
bit
of
vegetable
soup
taste
to
accompany
the
nose
but
the
biggest
part
of
what
i
tasted
was
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
decidedly
creamy
almost
milky
perhaps
skim
the
throat
and
aftertaste
was
rather
spicy
this
was
how
the
beer
tasted
throughout
most
of
the
session
although
at
one
point
toward
the
end
i
noticed
a
slightly
coppery
minerality
d
7
2
well
its
borderline
for
me
to
have
more
than
a
couple
of
these
guys
its
not
heavy
like
a
celebrator
but
damn
near
as
good
but
in
a
different
way
lighter
maybe
d
very
drinkable
nothing
overwhelming
but
goes
down
easy
for
a
db
very
decent
here
really
great
flavor
the
parts
around
it
make
it
less
appealing
overall
but
a
great
option
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
dark
beer
highly
drinkable
considering
the
7
2
alc
i
like
this
and
will
get
again
in
the
near
future
nice
beer
dark
brown
with
3
finger
head
at
first
i
thought
this
to
be
too
syrupy
sweet
but
after
i
let
it
sit
and
warm
up
just
a
bit
it
seems
to
have
really
mellowed
out
a
bit
and
seems
more
balanced
although
still
a
tad
sweet
its
not
overpowering
nice
bitter
hops
comes
through
in
the
end
and
helps
balance
out
i
would
get
this
again
and
would
like
to
sample
it
on
tap
drinkability
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
but
a
nice
beer
nonetheless
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
especially
with
a
plate
of
crunchy
bratwursts
some
sauerkraut
and
a
tub
of
spicy
mustard
to
go
along
with
them
yum
d
the
malts
are
nice
but
a
little
too
dominating
for
me
to
drink
alone
that
being
said
id
have
a
few
of
these
with
a
nice
meal
of
pork
or
beef
and
potatoes
cheers
d
goes
down
nice
and
easy
i
would
definitely
have
this
beer
again
mfd
a
very
thin
beer
would
have
liked
it
thicker
too
much
like
water
in
my
case
the
drinkability
is
fine
but
the
texture
from
the
lack
of
viscosity
is
a
bit
off
putting
the
taste
is
thick
and
full
flavored
but
very
smooth
many
different
tastes
come
to
mind
roasted
malt
and
hops
are
the
first
things
to
hit
the
taste
buds
as
i
savor
the
drink
a
little
more
i
taste
hints
of
chocolate
and
fruit
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
but
it
finishes
dry
cheers
and
good
drinking
d
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
i
would
have
it
again
considering
that
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
had
an
interesting
flavor
which
was
present
better
as
the
beer
warmed
a
little
bit
just
watch
out
for
the
7
2
abv
it
might
sneak
up
on
you
if
you
want
to
enjoy
a
couple
had
this
at
a
little
german
restaurant
in
my
home
town
of
brunswick
served
in
a
stange
it
was
a
reddishbrown
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
left
a
little
bit
of
lacing
aroma
was
caramel
and
raisins
taste
also
caramel
and
raisin
but
also
a
hint
of
chocolate
perhaps
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
i
think
there
could
be
more
of
a
malt
presence
still
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
drink
it
again
pours
dark
with
a
thin
head
and
slight
lacing
smells
malty
taste
of
malt
a
slight
roasted
flavor
with
some
carmel
notes
in
my
opinion
it
seems
to
be
on
the
thin
side
but
still
very
drinkable
the
abv
can
sneak
up
on
you
as
i
cant
detect
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
at
all
pretty
good
all
around
great
beer
full
of
flavors
full
bodied
yet
highly
drinkable
another
high
quality
product
from
spaten
notes
personally
i
thought
this
was
just
barely
an
aboveaverage
brew
nothing
too
special
going
on
here
but
a
commendable
effort
nonetheless
although
i
will
say
that
this
is
considerably
more
tasty
closer
to
room
temperature
overall
its
not
too
bad
but
nothing
special
excellent
beer
a
bit
on
the
dark
side
it
is
a
malt
liquor
after
all
something
else
to
keep
in
mind
in
my
personal
opinion
too
high
of
an
abv
at
7
2
for
a
session
beer
but
if
only
having
a
few
its
very
good
lots
of
flavour
not
too
overpowering
just
had
a
few
after
playing
hockey
but
would
probably
be
better
suited
to
accompany
food
such
as
pizza
d
i
wouldnt
call
this
an
excellent
beer
but
its
still
very
good
thick
rich
and
malty
with
nice
flavors
warming
and
drinkable
a
great
beer
experience
overall
this
was
a
pleasant
beer
to
enjoy
with
a
chess
game
and
some
sharp
cheddar
decent
alcohol
content
may
catch
up
after
a
few
but
a
tasty
beer
nonetheless
will
buy
again
overall
a
very
rich
deep
malty
beer
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
and
medium
in
body
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
and
it
lingers
on
the
palate
i
feel
that
there
is
a
little
too
much
hops
which
i
feel
is
a
bit
to
aggressive
on
the
palate
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
not
great
d
a
good
example
of
a
huge
style
made
drinkable
not
as
extreme
as
i
might
expect
but
mellow
enough
to
be
appreciated
a
fine
example
of
the
doppelbock
style
the
optimatorss
approachable
but
complex
flavor
of
burnt
grains
should
be
an
enjoyable
checkmark
on
the
list
of
any
selfrespecting
beer
lovers
conquests
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
so
far
its
my
favorite
spaten
pours
clear
chestnut
brown
with
thick
tan
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
thin
film
leaving
spotty
lace
sweet
malt
aroma
with
a
hint
of
cherries
and
chocolate
good
malt
flavor
with
caramel
and
roasted
malt
that
lingers
a
long
while
turning
just
a
little
bitter
at
the
end
pretty
mellow
really
both
in
flavor
and
in
mouthfeel
it
is
just
a
little
thin
the
carbonation
is
mild
with
just
a
little
zing
on
the
tongue
and
it
has
a
dry
finish
that
is
maybe
a
little
metallic
this
is
a
beer
that
i
have
always
enjoyed
though
i
do
not
buy
it
very
often
definitely
a
winter
purchase
for
me
goes
well
with
beef
stew
or
some
brats
d
this
is
one
of
the
easier
drinking
dopplebocks
out
there
nice
flavors
nothing
too
outstanding
nice
balance
and
it
goes
down
easy
a
great
example
of
the
style
heavy
bodied
medium
carbonation
the
toned
down
sweetness
is
a
plus
for
me
more
of
a
dry
character
than
most
doppelbocks
ive
had
overall
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
though
not
very
complex
a
nice
goto
doppelbock
that
is
easily
found
just
about
everywhere
and
never
fails
to
please
pours
a
clear
brown
color
with
one
inch
of
tan
head
that
slowly
settles
to
a
thin
cap
just
a
little
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
has
a
caramel
malt
aroma
the
flavor
as
well
features
the
malt
caramel
flavors
dominate
with
some
faint
noble
hop
flavors
coming
in
on
the
finish
alcohol
is
well
hiddened
with
just
a
little
warming
on
the
palate
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
leaves
a
nice
creamy
texture
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
a
cold
night
serving
type
bottle
overall
for
what
it
lacks
in
certain
areas
it
makes
up
for
in
high
drinkability
and
a
clean
refreshing
taste
great
bang
for
your
buck
all
in
all
a
great
beer
which
i
will
purchase
again
celebrator
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
so
its
good
to
have
a
cheaper
alternative
while
suffering
from
poverty
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
an
average
off
white
head
settled
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
of
brown
bread
some
soy
raisins
and
stale
coffee
a
good
punch
of
flavor
a
big
bready
malt
with
vinous
characteristics
light
soy
sauce
and
honey
a
coffee
flavor
pops
through
in
the
after
taste
typical
dopplebock
flavors
or
at
least
what
i
expect
definitely
a
good
malt
presence
but
the
feel
seems
thin
to
me
though
it
is
fairly
crisp
which
is
nice
a
very
nice
dopplebock
not
too
sweet
or
syrupy
has
a
bit
of
a
roasted
malt
presence
to
offset
the
sweetness
very
nice
and
perfect
for
a
4f
day
very
drinkable
it
was
very
smooth
low
carbonation
full
flavor
an
excellent
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
friends
and
fans
of
dopplebocks
i
like
it
and
it
wasnt
too
expensive3
roths
in
salem
dont
know
whay
i
taste
tobacco
so
much
in
it
but
ive
never
had
this

this
beer
is
everything
i
hoped
it
would
be
cant
recommend
it
enough
this
probably
deserves
a
better
rating
but
i
dont
get
into
doppelbocks
as
much
as
some
drinkability
easy
to
drink
for
a
doppelbock
at
7
2
and
easy
to
find
that
out
the
hard
way
pretty
nice
beer
inexpensive
for
a
higher
alcohol
brew
good
value
my
taste
have
changed
since
i
first
reviewed
this
beer
while
still
not
great
it
is
not
a
bad
drink
i
like
it
but
do
not
love
it
strong
alcohol
content
so
watch
out
poured
into
a
pint

oz

of
the

no

aroma
with
slight

predominates
and
that
damn
green
bottle
skunk
is
definately
there
light
carbonation
and
a
relatively
light
mounthfeel
belies
the
beers
actual
gravity
providing
a
pleasantly
drinkable
beer
drinkability
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
a
solid
example
of
the
doppelbock
style
highly
recommended
for
anyone
looking
to
get
into
doppelbocks
d
this
beer
will
go
to
your
head
if
not
careful
although
there
are
beers
with
higher
alcohol
content
very
few
seem
to
be
this
smooth
great
beer
to
drink
at
a
bar
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
opened
me
up
to
the
beer
world
so
i
am
bit
biased
it
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
with
a
strong
malt
smell
the
taste
is
very
malty
and
pleasing
this
isnt
the
best
doppelbock
ever
but
a
very
good
one
nonetheless
and
one
i
love
to
drink
and
would
highly
recommend
classic
doppelbock
d
all
night
long
or
until
i
feel
over
delicious
this
wouldnt
be
a
constant
pick
but
i
wasnt
disappointed
d
this
one
keeps
getting
better
as
you
drink
but
be
careful
cause
by
the
fourth
pint
you
might
wanna
get
the
next
one
to
go
i
tried
this
one
after
discovering
spaten
oktoberfest
its
hard
to
say
which
i
like
better
really
pours
a
rich
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
wonderful
longlasting
head
smells
very
good
with
heavy
roast
aromas
tastes
exceptional
it
has
a
very
complex
taste
which
honestly
i
cant
describe
in
any
other
way
than
to
say
to
try
it
its
wonderful
mouthfeel
is
very
heavy
which
is
appropriate
for
this
brew
it
makes
you
savor
the
beer
and
think
about
what
you
are
tasting
drinkability
is
decent
but
its
difficult
to
have
more
than
two
or
three
because
its
so
easy
to
savor
excellent
beer
truly
world
class
stuff
this
beer
drinks
itself
fairly
refreshing
i
first
had
this
in
germany
on
tap
about
3
years
ago
and
was
aching
to
dip
into
it
again
when
i
was
it
at
my
local
beer
store
all
in
all
this
beer
tasted
almost
exactly
like
regular
spaten
with
the
exception
of
the
orangishbrown
color
and
the
strength
a
solid
doppelbock
at
7
abv
it
does
not
have
the
substance
that
i
anticipate
from
a
doppelbock
and
really
does
not
bear
the
flavor
all
that
well
it
drank
far
better
on
tap
and
although
vaguely
differed
from
regular
spatens
crispness
the
bite
and
refreshing
finish
really
did
it
for
me
it
has
some
light
fruit
tones
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
though
it
drinks
like
a
lighter
beer
in
that
it
goes
down
easier
and
the
abv
strength
is
barely
noticeable
until
it
is
down
your
throat
d
good
beer
cant
drink
too
many
because
of
amount
of
alcohol
but
definitely
recommend
trying
it
d
drinks
very
well
good
balance
of
flavors
goes
well
with
meat
d
a
pretty
decent
bock
here
alc
is
hidden
is
hidden
well
there
isnt
a
ton
to
it
but
id
probably
drink
it
again
if
offered
d
definitely
a
sipper
for
me
but
i
could
drink
it
all
night
goes
down
quite
well
and
i
could
session
it
all
night
not
as
filling
as
i
expected
the
beer
pours
with
a
fine
tan
head
sitting
above
the
brown
liquid
with
ruby
highlights
the
aroma
has
a
strong
prune
raisin
smell
with
malt
presence
the
taste
has
the
same
characteristics
as
the
aroma
with
the
alcohol
slightly
detectable
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
thick
with
low
carbonation
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
winter
evening
d
fuller
body
might
get
in
the
way
after
a
while
but
i
always
like
a
good
doppelbock
from
time
to
time
and
this
is
exactly
what
this
one
is
good
pretty
good
drinkability
nice
little
sweet
treat
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
overall
this
beer
is
just
too
sweet
for
me
and
probably
not
the
best
selection
for
a
few
beers
while
watching
sunday
night
football
i
dont
think
ill
be
able
to
down
more
than
a
couple
in
one
sitting
poured
into
a
seidel
dark
clear
umber
with
a
nice
thick
tan
head
good
lacing
and
retention
aroma
is
freshly
baked
bread
with
a
hint
of
darker
fruits
tastes
like
carbonated
wheat
bread
accents
of
nuts
and
caramel
but
really
none
of
the
chocolate
and
roasty
notes
that
i
expect
from
a
doppelbock
not
quite
deep
enough
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
no
complaints
there
decent
drinkability
but
this
one
seems
like
a
beer
to
pair
with
something
rather
than
to
drink
on
its
own
thats
it
powerfully
sweet
doppel
aroma
is
killer
very
strong
and
hearty
with
lots
of
sweet
malts
and
a
dark
fruitiness
generous
brown
pour
sizable
head
that
calms
down
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
sweet
easy
going
down
with
a
nice
finish
flavor
is
highly
malty
really
hanging
on
the
sweet
side
nice
breadiness
with
some
strong
caramel
and
maple
syrup
influences
enjoyable
but
really
sweet
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
garnet
hues
and
a
thin
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aromas
of
molasses
and
grains
up
front
flavors
of
malasses
and
caramel
with
some
light
coffe
flavor
leading
to
a
stone
fruit
and
raisin
middle
with
a
strong
malty
aftertaste
medium
body
and
carbonation
this
is
a
mouth
cleansing
beer
very
smooth
easy
drinking
dopplebock
a
very
nice
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
for
years
but
i
believe
my
pallet
has
evolved
enough
to
where
i
perceive
it
a
bit
lackluster
i
love
the
carbonation
but
id
like
more
creaminess
in
the
mouthfeel
it
looks
phenomenal
though
ill
keep
the
remaining
few
bottles
and
slow
cook
some
sausages
and
beef
with
it
drinkability
very
drinkable
filling
so
i
dont
know
if
id
sit
down
and
have
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
time
but
this
is
something
i
would
love
to
have
in
the
fridge
to
reach
for
on
a
fall
evening
actually
im
drinking
this
for
lunch
as
i
review
it
this
can
be
a
meal
in
itself
hooray
doppelbock
pours
out
a
rich
caramelruby
color
with
a
large
tan
head
the
aroma
is
rich
fruits
and
malts
some
alcohol
also
the
flavor
is
sweet
fruits
and
malt
smooth
and
the
alcohol
is
really
well
hidden
7
2
but
very
nice
one
of
my
favorite
beers
available
locally
as
with
all
of
the
german
beers
crisp
and
clean
its
a
doppelbock
its
supposed
to
taste
like
one
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
nice
dark
brown
color
with
reddish
highlights
nice
carbonation
and
a
slight
head
that
left
a
bit
of
foam
at
the
edge
all
malt
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
the
taste
was
exactly
the
same
rich
roasted
malt
taste
yes
but
a
tad
bit
too
much
astringent
flavor
to
be
easy
drinking
but
then
thats
the
purpose
of
a
doppelbock
so
i
sipped
and
enjoyed
it
slowly
drinkability
im
a
doppelbock
lover
and
this
is
a
fine
doppelbock
it
has
a
nice
interesting
full
flavor
like
a
doppelbock
should
have
and
plenty
of
alcohol
so
you
dont
drink
too
many
the
taste
is
also
quite
nice
being
musty
whole
wheat
raisins
hints
of
charred
herbs
wood
and
licorice
but
the
latter
fades
soon
and
a
caramelly
chocolate
quiality
becomes
stronger
along
with
a
little
molasses
it
has
an
alcoholic
prunelike
spiciness
and
starts
sweeter
before
a
somewhat
drier
clean
finish
its
tasty
nicely
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
if
not
as
rich
and
complex
as
some
d
it
can
be
a
tad
on
the
boozy
side
but
its
still
fairly
drinkable
a
decent
substitute
for
celebrator
i
suppose
but
id
much
prefer
the
alternative
from
brauerei
aying
hadnt
had
one
of
these
for
a
while
and
so
picked
up
a
sixpack
my
motherinlaw
was
coming
to
town
and
she
likes
malty
dark
german
brews
so
i
figured
this
was
perfect
fits
the
bill
without
being
too
challenging
she
had
a
couple
before
i
realized
that
these
were
7
2
they
certainly
dont
taste
that
strong
and
it
had
been
years
since
i
had
any
pours
a
very
dark
chestnut
not
quite
opaque
and
with
very
little
head
nice
estery
and
malty
nose
with
some
light
spiciness
malt
warming
alcohol
and
thin
caramel
for
me
what
comes
through
mostly
in
the
taste
is
the
thin
caramel
rather
than
a
rich
maltiness
i
like
my
dopplebocks
a
little
maltier
tasting
than
this
but
it
does
have
a
fairly
elegant
profile
relatively
thin
in
the
mouth
but
very
smooth
and
way
too
easy
to
drink
id
prefer
a
celebrator
if
im
having
it
alone
but
this
does
pair
very
nicely
with
food
with
its
smooth
maltiness
ive
had
a
few
doppelbocks
in
the
past
and
didnt
like
them
at
all
so
i
tried
this
main
stream
one
and
my
verdict
is
i
dont
like
doppelbocks
while
this
is
the
best
of
the
ones
ive
had
i
still
dont
enjoy
them
a
total
lack
of
aroma
except
for
a
harsh
alcohol
smell
and
the
taste
is
lackluster
as
well
malty
with
more
biting
alcohol
just
not
what
i
want
in
a
beer
at
least
this
doppelbock
i
can
finish
unlike
the
others
i
tried
d
this
is
a
very
nice
dopplebock
smooth
and
tasty
this
beer
is
definitely
going
into
the
fridge
with
the
salvator
something
i
would
enjoy
after
a
long
hard
and
drawn
out
week
and
its
not
a
beer
i
would
suggest
to
a
buddy
who
has
never
drank
before
poured
from
bottle
a
deep
brown
almost
eggplant
very
clear
with
off
white
head
poor
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
of
dark
fruit
dark
cherry
plum
raisinish
and
a
bit
of
caramel
taste
was
pretty
good
too
better
than
i
ezpected
some
of
that
dark
fruit
mixed
with
some
malt
and
i
swear
a
touch
of
sweet
chocolate
just
a
touch
slight
taste
and
warming
effect
of
alcohol
as
it
goes
down
but
i
found
the
mouthfeel
slightly
thicker
and
oily
which
i
didnt
care
for
as
much
overall
a
good
beer
id
revisit
again
as
it
only
cost
5
bucks
for
a
6
pack
the
taste
is
fairly
complex
there
is
a
deep
caramel
almost
chocolatey
flavor
to
the
beer
there
is
a
warming
alcohol
presence
not
over
the
top
but
you
know
you
are
drinking
a
fairly
high
abv
beer
there
is
a
slight
nut
brown
and
raisiny
flavor
to
the
beer
overlaid
with
what
is
your
typical
malty
bock
flavor
there
is
very
little
carbonation
its
consistency
is
syrupy
and
there
is
a
thick
mouthfeel
the
aftertaste
has
a
slightly
throaty
quality
like
youve
had
an
alcohol
soaked
aperitif
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
worth
seeking
out
it
has
double
bock
written
all
over
it
and
quite
representative
of
the
style
solid
depth
with
the
mouthfeel
especially
when
warm
its
mediumfull
with
a
pleasing
silky
quality
creamy
and
solid
doppelbock
to
enjoy
in
a
liter
mug
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
on
tap
while
drugrunning
in
colorado
just
kidding
sort
of
ahem
off
the
tap
this
beer
was
a
dark
chestnut
brown
with
some
red
hues
near
the
edges
the
head
was
offwhite
and
quickly
descended
after
the
pour
but
retained
itself
well
as
a
collar
and
laced
well
too
the
aroma
was
mostly
toasted
malt
but
also
possessed
hints
of
nuts
alcohol
and
fruit
sweetness
the
flavor
profile
was
full
of
malt
richness
augmented
by
fruit
sugars
it
was
rich
chewy
and
nutty
reminiscent
of
german
candy
but
kept
level
but
underlying
hops
bitterness
the
finish
was
a
little
acidic
but
crisp
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
the
beer
quite
drinkable
a
great
example
of
a
doppelbock
and
much
easier
to
approach
than
many
of
the
style
overall
a
very
drinkable
doppelbock
but
not
one
ill
spring
for
again
if
i
have
a
choice
d
highly
drinkable
a
very
enjoyable
doppelbock
that
i
would
love
to
have
again
bottle
at
winking
lizard
this
brew
is
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
medium
thin
light
beige
head
that
dissipates
fairly
fast
thin
rings
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
malt
molasses
and
a
bit
of
plum
medium
body
with
a
sweet
toffee
and
malt
character
light
fruit
and
hops
are
present
as
well
but
the
sweetness
dominates
the
finish
is
sweet
with
caramel
and
roasted
malt
and
leaves
a
molasses
and
brown
sugar
aftertaste
decent
overall
although
it
swings
a
little
too
far
to
the
sweet
side
drinkability
well
the
abv
will
fool
you
if
you
dont
check
the
bottle
it
tastes
like
a
session
dopplebock
but
is
a
bit
too
strong
for
that
copper
color
with
a
crimson
hue
head
disappeared
immediately
no
lacing
faint
chocolate
aroma
with
hints
of
licorice
and
caramel
taste
of
molasses
is
fruity
and
sweet
with
heavy
malt
character
thick
and
fullbodied
optimator
is
a
very
tasty
doppelbock
but
is
just
too
sweet
to
go
crazy
with
overall
a
little
boozy
for
what
it
is
i
could
understand
if
it
was
much
more
of
a
flavorful
beer
mfd
chewy
with
a
creamy
feel
to
it
goes
down
nice
id
love
one
of
these
with
a
good
cigar
i
find
the
drinkability
to
be
good
i
think
i
could
put
down
a
couple
of
these
pretty
easily
in
a
session
optimator
is
definitely
one
of
my
goto
faves
sadly
this
one
was
served
a
bit
too
cold
and
suffered
in
head
retention
and
aromatics
because
of
it
still
an
awesome
beer
and
one
that
always
pleases
this
beer
seems
not
very
complex
but
highly
drinkable
though
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
d
very
drinkable
i
very
good
dark
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
pints
of
d
quite
drinkable
very
pleasant
abv
in
moderation
carbonation
was
relatively
light
in
this
almost
like
it
struggled
to
make
it
through
the
malts
however
this
also
seemed
to
add
some
character
to
it
that
makes
it
a
bit
different
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
dopple
bock
but
i
did
enjoy
this
brew
and
would
probably
drink
it
again
it
just
kept
pulling
me
back
in
for
another
taste
nice
i
could
drink
this
a
couple
of
times
but
it
is
too
strong
to
drink
all
night
d
not
as
sweet
as
some
so
a
bit
more
drinkable
in
my
book
really
enjoyed
the
complexity
not
a
bad
beer
not
sure
i
would
buy
again
because
its
just
not
my
style
but
thats
besides
the
fact
moderate
abv
would
make
for
only
a
couple
in
a
setting
this
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
thin
head
the
scent
is
a
little
subtle
but
i
think
i
catch
some
sweet
malt
with
some
candy
characteristics
the
taste
is
an
extension
of
the
smell
with
a
lot
of
sweetness
some
caramel
followed
by
a
touch
of
hops
and
some
alcohol
heat
on
the
backend
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
thick
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
doesnt
sit
too
heavily
for
a
doppelbock
and
i
wouldnt
consider
it
out
of
the
question
to
have
a
couple
in
one
sitting
with
some
rich
food
pours
a
deep
amberbrown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
lots
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aroma
seems
quite
sweet
with
some
maltiness
and
tart
fruitiness
a
sharp
tart
dark
fruity
taste
mixed
in
with
some
roasted
malts
and
sweet
sugary
notes
a
little
sour
in
the
finish
not
bad
overall
impression
this
is
a
nice
beer
as
i
said
before
it
isnt
complex
but
it
is
rich
i
dont
know
how
many
that
i
could
drink
in
a
sitting
but
it
is
very
smooth
there
is
no
real
prominent
alcohol
or
bitterness
d
heavy
but
enjoyable
complex
i
think
it
would
take
several
tasting
to
get
a
thorough
understanding
of
this
beer
i
may
just
be
willing
to
do
that
given
the
high
quality
of
the
brew
one
of
the
first
good
import
brews
i
ever
had
its
drinkability
and
fairly
high
alcohol
content
hit
me
hard
so
this
ones
been
a
sort
of
joke
around
the
house
and
ive
been
pretty
apprehensive
to
try
it
again
as
ive
stigmatized
it
sort
of
a
brew
shouldnt
have
that
kind
of
affect
on
a
man
and
i
think
im
smart
enough
now
to
know
my
boundaries
on
higher
alcohol
brews
so
ill
try
it
again
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
resilient
twofinger
tan
head
once
it
fades
an
inconsistent
but
chunky
lacing
is
left
behind
smells
of
huge
roasted
malts
with
some
caramel
thrown
in
for
good
measure
tastes
malty
and
sweet
with
an
undercurrent
of
hops
and
spice
smooth
and
delicious
with
some
roasted
nuts
in
the
mix
as
well
carbonation
is
good
in
this
light
to
medium
bodied
brew
superb
brew
with
just
enough
alcohol
to
keep
the
party
going
and
just
enough
taste
to
keep
the
party
interesting
very
good
finish
no
harsh
after
taste
id
have
another
if
i
could
i
was
very
happy
to
see
a
dopplebock
as
an
option
as
extent
of
craft
beer
ive
seen
in
disney
thus
far
is
sam
adams
anyway
this
beer
is
kind
of
average
for
a
dopplebock
in
that
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
pretty
standard
however
not
as
bold
as
most
there
is
a
malty
slightly
chocolaty
aroma
and
the
flavor
has
a
bit
of
a
dry
mouth
aftertaste
where
a
hint
of
hops
is
detectable
it
is
slightly
on
the
lighter
side
of
moderate
body
and
gravity
so
it
isnt
hard
to
get
thru
and
doesnt
weigh
you
down
not
til
the
2nd
one
at
least
if
youre
looking
for
a
bold
dopplebock
this
may
not
satisfy
however
it
drinks
nicely
as
a
mellower
db
while
walking
around
epcots
world
showcase
in
a
tropical
storm
in
my
case
today
pours
a
deep
mahoganyruby
color
shortlived
sandcolored
head
fades
to
a
nice
collar
of
foam
and
lots
of
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
freshly
baked
bread
some
nutty
aroma
and
a
faint
whiff
of
alcohol
big
rich
malty
taste
very
breadydoughy
perfect
balance
between
the
sweetness
and
a
very
mild
bitterness
this
beer
is
sturdy
very
creamy
carbonation
is
righteously
mellow
wow
this
is
something
you
could
drink
all
year
long
and
with
a
variety
of
different
foods
im
loving
this
brew
md
medium
body
and
carbonation
it
is
drinkable
i
suppose
but
i
dont
know
if
i
enjoyed
the
taste
enough
to
continue
drinking
more
i
guess
i
just
expected
more

of
the
optimator

an
accessible
doppelbock
that
avoids
the
overbearing
sweetness
that
often
dooms
the
style
purchased
at
kokoman
fine
wines
and
liquors
in
new
mexico
pours
a
lovely
dark
brown
with
a
nice
tight
cream
colored
head
aroma
is
of
fresh
baked
bread
and
a
hint
of
apple
strudel
tastes
of
fresh
bread
and
big
yeasty
doughnuts
with
a
good
mouthful
of
carbonation
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
i
enjoy
it
daily
jk
d
having
less
than
a
dozen
dobblebocks
under
my
belt
i
would
say
this
one
is
not
as
sweet
as
a
troegenator
and
tarter
and
tighter
in
many
aspects
thinner
and
more
complex
in
the
style
i
enjoyed
and
will
pull
for
again
edit
as
i
find
myself
ordering
this
more
and
more
as
a
falling
rock
nightcap
im
pick
up
some
maple
and
molasses
type
flavors
in
there
too
ontap
this
is
one
of
the
best
doppels
youll
find
in
the
states
the
bottled
version
isnt
quite
as
rich
but
its
still
very
highly
recommended
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
small
foamy
head
on
a
very
dark
amber
body
smells
of
a
typical
dark
yet
very
subtle
not
much
else
going
on
taste
is
okay
but
the
coffee
was
a
bit
much
rather
overpowering
as
was
the
alcohol
beer
gets
lost
in
those
characteristics
not
typically
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
okay
ive
had
better
poured
a
dark
amberbrown
color
which
produced
a
14
inch
head
but
disappeared
in
less
than
a
minute
no
lacing
no
cap
man
what
a
disappointment
in
the
appearance
hmmm
carbonation
just
isnt
there
aroma
of
dark
fruit
some
bready
malt
and
a
little
skunkiness
damn
these
green
bottles
taste
is
much
better
dark
fruit
raisins
burnt
caramel
slight
nuttiness
and
good
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
slightly
sweet
but
not
overpoweringly
so
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
crisp
and
thick
at
the
same
time
goes
down
pretty
easily
and
alcohol
is
wellhidden
a
good
doppel
but
ive
had
much
better
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
would
not
drink
many
of
these
back
to
back
but
it
is
a
good
sipping
beer
with
a
lot
of
character
poured
the
color
of
cherry
coke
with
very
little
head
crystal
clear
no
cloudiness
light
aroma
mostly
malty
in
character
initial
taste
was
malty
with
a
hoppy
finish
and
alcohol
warming
going
down
which
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
with
an
abv
of
7
2
very
tasty
beer
light
carbonation
which
explains
the
lack
of
head
medium
body
very
drinkable
overall
too
bad
the
flavor
didnt
last
a
good
beer
overall
id
drink
it
again
but
no
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
heavy
and
strong
its
beertime
turned
mealtime
if
it
were
1972
and
i
was
on
a
hunger
strike
protesting
the
olympic
games
following
the
munich
massacre
i
would
most
likely
be
surviving
on
regular
draughts
of
this
was
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
had
a
thin
tan
head
smelled
strongly
of
molasseses
taste
was
of
sweet
malt
a
slight
roasted
flavor
with
a
tiny
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
mouthfeel
was
average
with
high
carbonation
levels
quite
drinkable
though
especially
at
7
2
percent
alcohol
not
my
favorite
doppelbock
but
still
quite
good
and
an
excellent
standby
mouthfeel
is
heavy
bitter
a
flavorful
offering
slightly
creamy
delicious
i
would
buy
again
since
the
price
point
is
low
d
i
dig
the
big
malt
complexity
but
the
blend
of
flavors
simply
doesnt
jive
with
my
palate
for
very
long
this
is
one
and
done
definately
a
solid
session
beer
i
could
drink
this
all

very

maybe
some
banana
and

sweet
taste
initially
with
malt
follow
very
light
feel
in

and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
go
to
beer
for
me
because
of
its
easy
drinkability
while
masking
pretty
high
alcohol
d
very
good
drinkability
and
certainly
good
to
kick
back
with
a
few
im
not
one
to
drink
a
dark
beer
when
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
clear
glass
the
head
was
bountiful
nice
thick
white
head
about
3
fingers
thick
it
stuck
around
a
while
then
went
away
a
had
a
very
nice
smell
almost
a
mild
spiced
smell
is
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
i
might
have
to
change
my
position
on
dark
beers
i
picked
this
up
because
it
looked
intresting
and
its
a
very
interesting
beer
ill
definatly
buy
this
beer
again
notes
okso
this
was
not
exceptional
or
overly
complex
yet
i
felt
it
hit
the
spot
good
silky
tones
and
nice
abv
i
could
have
had
one
more
had
at
moan
and
dove
dark
but
clear
appearance
with
some
amber
hints
through
light
immediate
lacing
very
rich
in
malts
grains
and
nuts
in
aroma
very
enticing
and
thick
smells
really
incredible
taste
rich
but
not
too
heavy
malty
and
hoppy
medium
body
balances
out
its
delicious
dimensions
from
getting
too
extreme
overall
an
awesome
drink
this
beer
was
a
little
thin
for
a
doppelbock
but
had
a
pretty
decent
taste
i
had
it
chilled
in
my
warsteiner
mug
poured
a
deep
milk
chocolate
brown
with
not
much
head
aroma
was
of
slight
chocolate
and
some
brewed
coffee
notes
taste
was
thin
but
pretty
complex
with
a
good
balance
of
chocolate
malts
with
some
mocha
and
bittering
hops
in
the
background
if
i
ran
out
of
bread
i
would
have
no
problem
imbibing
this
lenten
beer
d
kind
of
threw
me
off
with
the
heavy
aroma
but
im
really
digging
it
with
some
dark
chocolate
one
pint
is
gonna
do
me
just
fine
for
the
rest
of
the
night
d
overall
this
is
an
alright
beer
though
it
didnt
blow
me
away
there
are
better
doppelbocks
out
there
d
absolutely
drinkable
the
carbonation
of
a
lighter
beer
and
the
flavors
of
a
heartier
darker
beer
refreshing
will
drink
again
taste
has
a
good
creamy
texture
with
good
carbonation
primarily
malty
not
overly
complex
with
the
flavors
slight
coffee
aspect
definitely
not
my
goto
doppelbock
d
while
quite
fullbodied
its
smooth
enough
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
a
thick
cola
like
blackness
oozed
into
my
glass
and
left
a
small
head
and
minimal
lace
rings
a
malty
smell
of
coffee
and
roasted
malt
maybe
cocoas
and
some
sweet
smells
also
a
coffee
roasted
malt
taste
with
an
overlying
smoothness
brought
on
by
caramel
moderate
dryness
on
the
backbite
as
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
noticeable
but
doesnt
ruin
the
beer
a
tad
simplistic
but
a
solid
beer
worth
trying
and
having
a
couple
at
the
bar
all
in
all
it
wasnt
my
favorite
offering
from
spaten
but
it
was
well
done
and
something
id
consider
having
again
a
tasty
doppelbock
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
dark
brazen
brown
body
with
a
white
settling
head
occupies
the
celebrator
glass
well
excellent
tracings
of
lace
heightened
malts
the
sweet
aroma
is
warming
and
inviting
smooth
mediumbodied
with
little
effervescence
around
the
tongue
and
below
creamy
the
pitch
of
bready
yeasts
and
malts
are
empowering
rich
and
rewarding
the
end
is
warming
in
the
first
of
six
doppelbocks
sampled
the
optimator
sets
a
brisk
pace
the
malts
arrive
as
expected
balanced
as
the
lion
and
lamb
month
they
re
intended
for
recommended
drinkability
was
fine
it
is
higher
alcohol
though
oddly
enough
it
went
with
my
turkey
on
wheat
d
a
good
doppelbock
maybe
a
little
fresher
tasting
and
less
complex
than
several
others
but
well
worth
drinking
d
perfect
for
cool
spring
days
strength
limits
me
to
one
in
a
sitting
drinkability
is
sneaky
because
this
is
still
a
7
2
abv
brew
i
read
someone
saying
one
could
get
into
trouble
by
not
realizing
this
and
i
agree
it
goes
down
much
smoother
than
a
beer
should
at
this
alcohol
content
level
and
in
the
bigger
bottles
its
common
habit
to
try
to
finish
it
before
it
warms
though
i
still
stand
by
my
belief
that
this
beer
tastes
better
warm
all
in
all
an
above
average
dopplebock
4s
across
the
board
bright
and
crisp
for
the
style
with
mild
acidity
and
a
yeasty
starchy
feel
moderate
carbonation
and
full
body
for
the
style
somewhat
aggressive
carbonation
lightmoderate
body
pretty
drinkable
but
a
little
more
rough
than
the
best
examples
of
the
style
easy
to
drink
you
cant
tell
its
abv
is
7
2
could
get
messed
up
if
you
arent
careful
d
dangerously
drinkable
at
7
2
abv
especially
excellent
for
an
import
it
stands
up
as
an
superb
bock
with
exceptional
smoothness
and
sweet
maltiness
i
must
confess
that
i
have
not
really
tried
other
doppelbocks
despite
my
strong
affection
for
this
one
i
might
rereview
if
drinking
more
of
them
changes
my
standards
on
its
own
merits
this
is
a
delicious
beer
and
really
quite
impressive
for
the
massproduced
nature
of
it
would
love
to
try
it
really
fresh
someday
overall
impression
a
clean
malty
german
lager
nothing
over
the
top
but
true
to
style
recommended
this
is
very
drinkable
and
fairly
affordable
when
tjs
check
it
out
then
again
you
might
prefer
the
sweeter
more
carbonated
winterfest
a
very
good
doppelbock
i
purchased
a
pint
bottle
of
this
since
im
a
fan
of
spaten
beers
like
their
oktoberfest
beerpilser
ect
btu
this
bock
beer
was
just
way
too
syrupy
to
me
taste
wasnt
that
bad
but
overwhelming
this
is
good
beer
to
try
a
few
sips
but
after
a
while
the
strong
syrupy
taste
does
get
to
you
overall
a
great
beer
but
one
that
you
could
get
better
and
fresher
from
a
domestic
brewer
although
high
in
alcohol
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
a
dark
brown
color
with
two
finger
head
of
foam
a
strong
beer
with
semi
sweet
aftertaste
not
nearly
as
bitter
as
i
was
expecting
there
was
no
freshness
date
but
it
tasted
fresh
enough
for
an
import
i
still
dont
understand
why
they
use
a
green
bottle
i
like
this
beer
very
malty
and
pleasant
this
is
something
to
look
for
the
body
is
moderately
heavy
for
a
german
beer
and
goes
down
real
smooth
can
be
a
sipping
drink
or
something
to
drink
a
big
stein
of
the
flavors
seemed
a
bit
mild
but
the
delivery
system
was
anything
but
this
stuff
was
thick
it
hurt
drinkability
but
made
for
one
beernique
experience
ah
the
optimator
many
many
many
many
years
ago
when
i
first
turned
21
this
was
one
of
my
first
non
standard
foreign
beers
back
when
beer
diversity
was
much
lower
but
spaten
could
often
be
found
its
still
a
quality
brew
although
i
could
have
sworn
the
abv
used
to
be
higher
long
ago
i
seem
to
recall
that
it
used
to
be
8
9
abv
in
any
case
a
nice
malty
double
bock
nicely
balanced
worthy
of
trying
although
the
spaten
dunkelweisse
is
still
the
best
beer
they
make
d
not
always
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
fairly
balanced
with
some
bitterness
helping
the
drinkablility
for
me
d
this
is
as
drinkable
as
a
doppel
can
be
even
sweetness
and
fullness
while
the
alcohol
is
warming
but
not
perceptable
in
the
taste
this
brew
is
a
classic
doppel
very
malted
and
very
tasty
it
pours
to
a
root
beer
color
and
consistency
smell
is
like
maple
syrup
with
a
slight
bit
of
roasted
malt
taste
is
a
very
creamy
and
smooth
with
only
hints
of
bitterness
this
beer
is
a
maltmania
of
the
brewing
process
the
carbonation
seems
light
but
is
evident
it
suits
the
creaminess
more
would
be
too
much
spaten
has
a
very
good
beer
here
the
sweetness
may
lower
the
drinkability
but
in
my
opinion
for
its
style
this
brew
is
right
on
target
d
ive
tried
this
a
few
times
now
and
this
just
doesnt
seem
to
agree
with
me
theres
nothing
bad
here
i
just
dont
enjoy
this
guy
generally
has
a
nice
flavor
but
a
little
too
high
in
alcohol
for
me
to
want
to
drink
this
regularly
for
this
style
quite
drinkable
i
could
finish
a
few
of
these
with
no
problem
but
its
lent
so
im
holding
back
pours
a
hazy
dark
color
very
malty
profile
in
the
head
and
aroma
taste
is
dark
somewhat
sour
malts
come
through
a
hint
of
licorice
finishes
dry
not
that
smooth
alcoholic
but
well
hidden
very
balanced
and
flavors
do
not
muddle
overall
a
solid
beer
d
i
find
this
to
be
a
fine
example
of
the
class
with
quite
a
nice
balance
between
flavours
it
goes
down
so
smooth
and
slick
that
its
all
too
easy
perhaps
there
could
be
a
bit
more
going
on
but
its
quite
satisfying
the
way
it
is
that
the
mouthfeel
is
so
good
enhances
the
taste
while
also
making
this
perfectly
drinkable
this
is
one
to
grab
a
sixer
enjoy
three
and
cellar
the
others
a
great
example
of
dopplebock
very
delicious
flavorful
and
easy
to
consume
the
nose
might
suffer
from
my
impatience
im
willing
to
admit
yet
the
taste
is
so
good
that
it
will
be
difficult
to
sit
and
savor
this
for
long
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
is
great
medium
bodied
and
perfectly
carbonated
drinkable
enough
that
i
had
to
have
one
more
while
sampling
the
beers
in
the
world
showcase
was
great
with
my
pretzel
and
mustard
too
good
example
of
the
style
well
balanced
but
lacks
the
complexity
of
some
better
bocks
d
i
could
put
back
a
couple
of
these
but
this
feels
more
like
an
enjoyment
beer
than
a
food
pairing
beer
drinkability
good
beer
to
drink
but
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
2
bottles
this
beer
is
really
really
rich
the
beer
is
a
nice
mahogany
with
a
little
bit
of
offwhite
head
sticky
head
it
smells
pretty
fragrant
with
nice
darker
malts
some
coffee
flavors
hints
of
hoppy
bitterness
it
tastes
of
sweet
dark
roasted
malts
with
some
very
smokey
flavors
there
are
also
hints
of
tobacco
and
other
herbs
light
hop
bitterness
kicks
in
during
the
lingering
finish
of
the
sip
the
beer
is
thick
and
a
little
on
the
syrupy
side
not
for
the
style
but
smooth
a
real
good
indicator
of
the
style
it
has
all
of
the
smokey
malty
flavors
you
want
with
no
excess
kind

drink
a

pack
of
this
beer
my
first
time
i
ever
heard
or
had
one
and
i
love
it
drinkability
is
solid

when
you
have
a

like
my

did
keep
in

the

is

play
it

i
am
a

for

i

buy
them
if
you
get
to
germany
it
is
readily
available
on
tap
at
least
where
i
was
stationed
kaiserslautern
germany
for
those
who
want
to
know
spaten
means
shovel
or
spade
dont
drink
and
review
i
really
like
this
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
that
many
of
them
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
more
on
draft
then
poured
from
a
bottle
d
not
bad
goes
down
very
smooth
would
be
very
easy
to
drink
a
number
of
these
d
definitely
feeling
the
7
2
right
now
an
hour
after
the
tasting
and
the
sweetness
makes
me
drink
it
waaayyyy
too
fast
extremely
enjoyable
despite
the
fact
that
you
might
not
be
able
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
at
a
time
every
spaten
ive
had
has
been
rock
solid
and
the
optimator
is
no
different
the
idea
of
these
spaten
styles
being
brewed
yearround
is
a
dual
edged
sword
on
one
hand
the
styles
and
beers
themselves
are
done
well
and
are
unique
in
that
theyre
available
yearround
but
also
doesnt
it
tarnish
it
a
bit
to
be
classified
as
an
imported
macro
of
sorts
while
you
ponder
that
ill
have
another
optimator
d
it
was
ok
but
not
one
that
i
would
by
again
this
beer
is
a
very
drinkable
example
of
the
style
it
pourse
a
crystal
clear
with
a
rapidly
dissapearing
head
the
aroma
is
malty
caramel
slight
alcohol
bread
carbonation
is
somewhat
lower
than
paulaner
salvator
which
i
consider
a
deficiency
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thinner
than
the
paulaner
too
finish
is
a
bit
acidic
all
in
all
a
perfectly
drinkable
db
buty
i
give
the
edge
to
paulaner
salvator
for
its
better
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
if
you
can
find
spaten
on
tap
theres
not
much
better
its
good
in
the
bottle
too
though
it
has
a
very
unique
taste
thats
very
german
its
so
complex
its
very
hard
to
describe
but
theres
some
raisin
burnt
toast
and
nutmeg
you
cant
drink
a
lot
of
this
stuff
because
it
feels
like
a
lead
weight
in
your
stomach

was

even
though
bocks
we
meant
for
spring
consumption
who
cares
ive
had
two
quite
different
experiences
with
this
beer
to
start
off
with
i
love
the
dopplebock
style
the
first
time
i
had
optimator
i
drank
it
with
a
dinner
of
marinated
london
broil
stuffing
and
spinach
it
was
awesome
as
all
the
other
reviews
say
this
beer
is
undeniably
hugely
malty
i
thought
i
would
have
trouble
finishing
the
meal
but
the
beer
washed
it
down
and
turned
out
to
be
a
great
pairing
the
second
time
i
had
it
was
a
little
while
after
a
meal
and
my
second
beer
of
the
night
this
time
i
found
it
almost
impossible
to
finish
i
thought
it
might
get
a
little
better
if
i
let
it
warm
up
but
that
made
it
worse
the
big
roasted
caramel
maltiness
was
just
too
much
very
sweet
and
very
filling
the
alcohol
bite
became
all
too
apparent
as
well
which
is
never
a
good
thing
in
my
book
so
this
review
is
somewhat
of
an
average
of
the
two
tastings
bottom
line
is
this
is
a
solid
dopplebock
but
dont
let
it
get
too
warm
and
you
probably
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
a
couple
in
a
short
period
of
time
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
doppelbock
a
bit
stronger
than
the
celebrator
so
its
not
a
session
beer
but
still
if
you
cant
find
the
celebrator
and
are
looking
for
a
good
doppelbock
this
is
a
good
example
pours
a
medicore
tan
head
with
pour
retention
but
a
great
deep
ruby
light
leathery
brown
mixture
which
light
can
penetrate
beautifully
there
is
a
little
hint
of
maple
syrup
in
the
nose
of
this
lightly
smokey
and
deply
toasted
malt
dopplebock
the
taste
has
plenty
of
ruby
tasting
malts
hints
of
dark
fruits
and
even
a
slight
hint
of
licorice
in
the
finish
very
smooth
a
mildly
sweet
palate
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drnk
beer
beer
considerng
the
abv
i
would
definetlly
think
of
this
as
a
session
beer
if
the
alcohol
content
wasnt
high
dthis
is
one
of
the
maltiest
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
makes
it
a
slow
drink
almost
like
a
weak
harveys
elizabethian
ale
d
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
pretty
good
but
not
great
first
drink
surprised
me
with
how
malty
it
is
but
like
i
said
as
it
warmed
i
was
able
to
note
some
other
complexities
i
could
have
three
or
four
of
these
at
a
gathering
in
fact
i
did
this
brew
poured
dark
and
thick
with
a
head
the
color
of
espresso
foam
not
a
lot
of
aroma
but
taste
was
toasted
malt
tasty
and
tangy
molases
flavor
notes
were
present
and
the
finish
was
chocolaty
and
malty
mouthfeel
was
soft
and
pleasant
drinkability
was
ok

plenty

not

though
w
a

as

not

as
it
smelled
a

bodied
brew
for
the
style
but
plenty
of
dextrins
to
leave
the
flavor
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
ive
just
had
many
better
bocks
i
could
do
with
a
bit
more
complexity
but
for
what
it
does
it
does
it
well
i
am
a
big
fan
of

and
this
classic
does
not

nice
beer
to
sip
on
at
night
with
a
book
eric
the
bottom
line
im
a
big
fan
of
the
doppelbock
style
and
while
this
is
a
passable
example
there
are
numerous
others
that
i
would
take
over
this
including
locally
brewed
options
drink
one
slow
and
enjoy
a
second
may
be
tempting
but
at
7
2
abv
watch
out
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
and
got
a
nice
head
and
noticed
it
quickly
drizzled
into
a
smaller
creamy
head
that
stayed
steady
with
the
drink
this
ale
had
a
very
nice
scent
to
it
that
had
smells
of
raisin
and
plum
the
color
was
a
nice
dark
brown
just
the
kind
of
ale
i
like
the
taste
was
very
good
i
was
impressed
because
i
was
expecting
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
aand
i
didnt
get
that
at
all
i
tried
this
beer
just
on
a
whim
and
was
not
dissappointed
this
brew
is
a
7
2
which
is
right
up
my
alley
i
will
definetly
be
buying
more
of
this
brand
if
you
can
find
one
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
it
up
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
will
definatly
creep
up
on
you
if
youre
not
careful
this
is
a
really
good
beer
pretty
straight
forward
but
very
good
dthis
is
a
long
time
favorite
of
mine
and
every
time
i
have
another
i
reaffirm
that
feeling
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
every
aspect
of
it
feels
well
thought
out
and
executed
this
is
a
great
example
of
how
good
beer
should
be
the
only
reason
i
dont
give
this
5s
is
because
optimator
doesnt
blow
my
mind
when
i
drink
it
i
think
damn
that
is
good
really
really
good
but
this
isnt
the
type
of
beer
that
makes
you
change
the
way
you
think
about
a
style
it
doesnt
make
me
think
that
there
isnt
anyting
better
but
it
certainly
does
make
me
realize
how
much
better
it
is
than
alot
of
the
crap
that
is
out
there
drinkability
a
great
overall
beer
drinkability
easy
to
enough
to
consume
not
as
sweet
as
other
dobblebocks
nothing
too
great
but
always
enjoy
this
style
overall
it
has
a
clean
quality
taste
you
expect
from
spatenbrau
i
could
drink
several
optiators
i
enjoyed
and
would
recommend
beautiful
looking
beer
poured
a
nice
thick
3finger
offwhite
head
that
very
gradually
receded
to
a
sheet
dark
brown
body
just
like
i
like
em
smell
was
faintly
skunky
ill
blame
the
green
bottle
the
taste
didnt
really
impress
me
it
was
definitely
malty
but
not
as
roasty
as
i
would
have
liked
i
understand
this
is
a
doppelbock
so
i
shouldnt
be
too
surprised
i
guess
the
flavor
reminded
me
a
lot
of
old
chub
scotch
ale
without
the
smokiness
its
a
very
simple
malt
flavor
no
hoppiness
no
toastiness
just
malty
this
is
my
introduction
to
the
style
and
im
sure
to
find
more
complex
brews
out
there
drinkability
its
a
pleasant
middleoftheroad
doppelbock
drinkability
complex
flavors
smooth
mouthfeel
and
wellmasked
alcohol
make
for
an
easy
drinking
beer
eventually
that

abv
will
catch
up
with
you
love
this
beer
a
truly
great
dopplebock
when
you
take
into
account
the
price
and
availabilty
its
hard
to
beat
o
good
beer
overall
but
a
little
too
malty
and
under
carbonated
for
me
seems
like
it
would
go
well
with
rare
red
meat
personally
i
dont
think
i
will
be
trying
it
again
soon
overall
very
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
german
beers
though
the
alcohol
will
creep
up
on
you
pairs
well
with
food
of
many
varieties
works
well
with
chocolate
desserts
as
well
as
with
spicy
meats
accompanies
a
bratwurst
quite
well
as
does
spaten
premium
lager
a
bock
of
the
highest
order
d
one
is
enough
nice
different
beer
but
not
a
session
beer
deep
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
large
creamcolored
initial
head
which
faded
to
a
thin
covering
leaving
sticky
lace
bubbles
a
bit
on
the
larger
side
when
cold
it
smells
of
carbonation
a
bit
medicinal
and
then
all
of
the
heavy
sweet
malt
aromas
come
through
when
warmed
the
beer
smells
much
more
appealing
a
bit
of
diacetyl
some
spicy
hops
begin
to
balance
out
the
malt
bomb
the
beer
also
tastes
better
when
warmer
i
think
that
the
recommended
temp
on
this
one
is
too
cold
more
like
5560
in
my
opinion
caramel
malt
balls
raisin
toffee
all
present
classic
doppelbock
and
fairly
drinkable
for
the
7
2
i
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
because
i
my
1
liter
oktoberfest
mug
is
dirty
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
types
of
beer
so
im
going
to
show
that
in
my
review
the
color
is
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
moderate
and
lasting
tannish
head
it
gives
off
an
aroma
of
sweet
roasted
malt
and
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
i
taste
a
mild
carmellike
sweetness
with
the
warming
sensation
due
to
the
higherthanaverage
alcohol
content
very
nice
not
too
overpowering
just
right
smooth
and
perfectly
carbonated
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
with
a
7
2
alcohol
content
very
good
beer
comment
nice
beer
that
i
could
easily
enjoy
in
a
bar
or
during
an
afternoon
watching
a
baseball
game
it
poured
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
disapears
rather
quickly
the
smell
from
my
glass
to
me
isnt
all
that
good
but
it
does
have
its
own
smell
to
me
the
taste
also
doesnt
get
me
going
its
not
bad
but
just
not
my
style
its
got
medium
carbonation
so
its
pretty
smooth
in
the
mouth
over
all
i
could
drink
a
couple
pints
of
this
beer
but
would
switch
it
up
after
just
a
few
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
it
left
a
dry
aftertaste
that
was
only
quenched
by
another
sip
of
the
beer
drinkability
is
good
because
the
alcohol
is
not
aggressive
at
all
i
would
have
another
served
from
a
bottle
into
a
tapered
mug
poured
deep
caramel
amber
with
offwhite
rather
quickly
fading
head
aromas
of
green
apple
and
brown
sugar
emerged
with
notes
of
drunken
cherry
and
yeasty
whole
grain
bread
tasted
of
caramel
and
ripe
plum
with
a
hop
bite
at
the
end
and
a
sour
apple
fade
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
silky
and
refreshing
finished
thin
tasty
and
enjoyable
but
not
one
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
i
got
this
beer
after
having
been
recommended
to
me
by
workmates
this
beer
pours
well
very
small
head
that
lingers
a
bit
smell
is
sweet
in
that
almost
salty
fermented
way
that
i
am
not
so
fond
of
taste
is
much
of
the
same
overly
fermented
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
however
despite
the
heavy
taste
this
beer
might
make
a
good
winter
warmer
however
ill
likely
stick
with
rogues
santas
private
reserve
or
a
nice
barleywine
when
the
weather
turns
cold
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
i
probably
wont
have
it
again
due
to
personal
preference
could
drink
a
six
pack
of
these
if
you
wanted
to
pours
a
deep
deep
ruby
colorwhen
held
up
to
the
light
very
nice
indeed
thick
tan
head
settles
extremely
quickly
aroma
is
a
bit
of
sweet
caramel
and
grain
taste
is
somewhat
lacking
i
had
high
hopes
after
the
beautiful
color
and
not
displeasing
aroma
but
this
left
me
wanting
more
taste
is
malty
sweet
but
with
hints
of
metallic
maybe
its
past
its
prime
hmm
not
sure
mouthfeel
is
not
bad
not
to
thick
not
to
watery
thin
but
doesnt
appear
to
be
much
depth
to
it
as
far
as
drinkability
is
concerned
i
doubt
very
much
id
try
this
one
again
i
just
dont
care
for
this
style
of
beer
and
of
its
kind
it
is
definitely
the
worst
i
have
had
so
far
d
immensely
drinkable
for
what
it
is
d
goes
down
well
for
high
abv
tastes
better
as
it
warms
up
does
not
fill
the
stomach
up
too
much
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
color
with
a
small
head
some
lacing
aroma
is
strong
with
hints
of
caramel
brown
sugar
and
malt
sweetness
only
the
second
dopplebock
ive
had
the
taste
starts
out
sweet
and
malty
upfront
and
fades
into
a
caramel
aftertaste
that
is
kind
of
thin
a
second
sip
confirms
the
same
being
almost
too
sweet
a
good
representative
of
the
style
but
by
no
means
better
than
celebrator
this
was
equally
a
great
find
and
surprise
this
brew
pours
a
clear
black
color
which
has
reddish
hues
when
held
up
to
light
the
head
is
one
centimeter
in
height
and
recedes
within
seconds
into
sparce
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
grass
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
the
taste
is
of
a
lot
less
grassy
as
than
the
aroma
it
is
of
caramel
and
dark
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
cream
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
doppelbock
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
i
would
much
rather
have
a
paulaner
than
this
one
i
would
drink
it
again
but
only
if
nothing
better
were
available
pours
a
beautiful
rich
chocolate
brown
aroma
is
strong
mainly
malty
and
tempting
flavor
is
rich
and
malty
with
hints
of
toffee
and
a
smoky
undertone
there
is
not
the
least
bit
of
bitterness
smooth
very
pleasing
this
beer
is
great
all
by
itself
especially
after
a
meal
above
average
drinkability
for
abv
filling
and
satisfying
d
the
abv
is
a
bit
much
but
still
a
real
drinkable
beer
d
a
solid
beer
that
i
love
to
drink
this
beer
hooked
me
from
the
first
sip
it
was
a
darker
in
color
than
i
expected
but
had
a
lighter
taste
than
the
look
very
smooth
on
the
first
sip
and
good
to
the
last
drop
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
very
mindfull
of
a
heavy
draught
like
guiness
but
the
taste
goes
more
along
the
lines
of
an
english
ale
i
would
recomend
this
to
anyone
that
wants
to
try
it
i
will
be
keeping
this
one
in
constant
supply
drinkability
is
excellent
this
one
goes
down
easy
and
tastes
great
d
a
good
dopplebock
for
me
not
up
there
with
salvator
and
celebrator
but
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
a
great
beer
and
style
for
spring
and
the
cooler
months
not
a
bad
choice
optimator
is
quite
representative
of
the
style
but
it
doesnt
quite
stack
up
with
some
of
the
elite
doppelbocks
that
are
out
there
in
closing
i
really
like
this
brew
and
i
recommend
highly
d
quite
good
not
the
best
doppelbock
ive
had
but
excellent
for
the
price
recommended
poured
a
very
dark
brown
color
and
head
didnt
last
too
long
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
this
was
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
ive
had
taste
is
kind
of
sweet
malt
molasses
raisins
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
doppelbocks
but
this
was
pretty
good
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
two
however
so
dont
purchase
this
as
a
session
beer
well
well
well
this
may
have
single
handedly
brought
me
back
to
the
style
i
really
love
my
german
beers
and
grandma
would
be
proud
spaten
did
not
let
me
down
as
i
am
now
definatly
looking
forward
to
try
a
few
more
from
this
style
this
went
very
well
with
hamburgers
of
all
things
tonight
it
was
just
light
enough
to
be
sessionable
sort
of
more
likely
drinkable
during
a
hot
night
but
yet
dark
enough
to
peak
intrest
and
really
get
you
into
the
sipping
mode
for
a
while
overall
i
am
really
glad
i
picked
up
a
six
pack
pf
this
i
will
be
enjoying
it
very
much
over
the
next
couple
weeks
a
fantastic
beer
from
a
great
brewery
d
this
is
where
this
one
shines
its
less
cloyingly
sweet
than
some
other
dopplebocks
but
its
also
less
flavorful
in
a
way
the
lighter
flavor
and
mouthfeel
make
this
a
much
better
candidate
for
a
session
than
a
heavy
chocolate
cake
assertive
dopplebock
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
bells
dimpled
mug
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
visible
carbonation
and
a
one
finger
thick
beige
head
that
slowly
faded
away
no
lace
the
aroma
consisted
of
rich
roasted
malts
and
a
sweet
caramel
note
the
flavor
was
mostly
malty
with
notes
of
caramel
and
dark
fruit
the
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
lively
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
alcohol
very
well
done
excellent
this
beer
is
amazing
and
can
stand
up
to
some
of
the
best
beers
i
can
think
of
i
got
this
at
my
local
publix
so
its
very
available
but
that
availability
doesnt
compromise
the
flavor
its
even
better
on
tap
with
the
complexities
of
the
flavor
becoming
even
more
pronounced
and
the
aroma
somehow
a
lot
better
highly
recommended
drinkability
damn
good
easy
to
drink
for
a
dark
beer
definitely
a
beer
you
can
knock
back
a
few
of
without
getting
sleepy
like
from
something
similar
to
guinness
i
dont
know
what
it
is
about
this
beer
even
though
its
only
7
2

it
packs
a
punch
i
good

beer
just
dont
go
too
far
served
chilled
in
a
250
ml
mug
poured
into
a
spaten
tall
half
liter
glass
with
a
deep
dark
amber
hue
a
white
head
that
that
did
not
last
too
long
aroma
of
dark
fruits
and
slightly
alcoholic
it
has
a
lighter
body
and
a
nice
bitterness
to
the
dark
fruit
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
not
as
noticable
but
it
does
pack
a
punch
drinkability
easy
drinking
and
slightly
sessionable
d
impressive
easy
to
drink
and
compliments
nearly
any
meal
this
is
a
doppelbock
worth
finding
it
has
a
pleasant
flavor
and
wonderful
presence
note
in
some
places
in
the
us
you
can
thankfully
buy
this
beer
in
brown
halfliter
bottles
for
me
other
dopplebocks
just
dont
measure
up
some
others
are
a
little
too
bitter
while
optimator
is
very
malty
it
isnt
bitter
the
ultramalty
taste
may
grab
you
at
first
but
it
finishes
smooth
leaving
little
to
no
after
taste
gets
better
as
it
warms
or
as
i
warm
either
way
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
a
style
that
is
starting
to
grow
on
me
it
isnt
quite
the
best
in
the
style
but
its
right
up
there
and
its
pretty
good
its
one
of
those
beers
where
the
taste
gets
better
as
you
continue
to
drink
it
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
stick
with
for
a
whole
evening
poured
into
a
glass
stein
this
is
the
darkest
beer
ive
ever
had
very
dark
browncopper
color
tan
twofinger
head
collapses
quickly
smell
is
a
sweet
slightly
burnt
malt
and
caramel
and
you
can
definitely
detect
the
alcohol
tastes
of
roasted
hops
caramel
and
even
slight
anise
and
coffee
with
a
medium
dry
finish
and
some
warmth
from
the
high
abv
goes
down
pretty
smooth
but
this
sure
is
a
change
from
my
usual
weitzen
the
sweetness
would
probably
discourage
me
from
drinking
too
many
of
these
but
im
on
my
second
so
well
see
overall
much
better
than
i
expected
from
a
doppelbock
pours
a
cola
colored
aber
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
smells
of
fruit
and
malt
not
as
aromatic
as
i
would
like
tastes
great
fruity
and
malty
even
with
the
higher
abv
the
alcohol
is
negligable
smoke
flavors
come
out
as
does
light
chocolate
hints
damn
good
beer
pardon
my
french
spaten
optimator
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
versions
of
the
doppelbock
style
pours
a
beautiful
dark
copper
with
decent
head
and
faint
lacing
aroma
comes
forth
as
a
peaty
meaty
fullbodied
whiff
of
malty
deliciousness
tastes
like
a
sweet
caramel
apple
on
steroids
sweet
going
down
going
to
light
dry
to
the
finish
heavy
chewy
mouthfeel
makes
this
an
exceptional
brew
both
in
bottles
and
on
tap
so
smooth
that
extra
care
must
be
taken
if
consumed
in
a
party
atmosphere
goes
great
with
a
hearty
chicken
mole
or
greasy
enchiladas
served
in
a
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
poured
a
deep
amber
forming
a
thin
14
inch
head
that
quickly
faded
light
spots
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
predominantly
skunky
but
light
notes
of
malt
coming
through
the
skunkiness
seems
to
fade
a
bit
towards
the
end
the
taste
is
a
mix
of
sweet
and
roasted
malts
the
flavor
is
thick
and
full
coffee
and
a
hint
of
peanuts
medium
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
way
better
than
i
expected
if
the
abv
wasnt
as
high
i
would
drink
this
as
a
session
ale
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
the
first
german
beer
that
wasnt
completely
killed
by
the
skunky
smell
a
malty
backbone
paces
the
flavor
but
plenty
of
fruit
joins
in
particularly
in
the
finish
a
hint
of
alcohol
spurs
the
whole
melange
forward
typically
sweet
but
more
fruity
and
lacking
the
dryness
of
a
lot
of
doppels
that
ive
tried
texture
is
thick
and
bready
the
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
raisin
nut
bread
or
something
similar
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
dark
beer
this
beer
is
proof
that
large
brewers
can
and
do
make
quality
beers
this
is
a
great
beer
another
quality
doppelbock
i
must
admit
this
is
becoming
a
new
favorite
of
mine
and
this
beer
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
yum
poured
from
the
bottle
a
dark
orangebrown
reddish
brown
in
the
glass
with
some
lighter
amber
around
the
edges
the
head
dissipated
rather
quickly
the
smell
was
sweet
and
malty
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
smooth
the
taste
was
also
sweet
malty
bready
and
just
a
little
earthy
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
went
well
with
the
cheeseburger
and
french
fries
i
was
eating
i
am
trying
to
cultivate
an
appreciation
for
sweeter
maltier
less
hoppy
beers
and
this
was
a
good
one
to
start
with
though
it
was
different
from
normal
for
me
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
my
buddy
swears
by
this
and
i
had
never
had
a
doppel
not
to
mention
the
7
pricetag
at
trader
joes
seeming
like
a
steal
poured
into
a
pint
glass
unfourtunately
and
had
a
great
dark
ruby
color
with
brownish
head
the
smell
is
very
sweet
but
a
whisk
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
all
there
lots
of
caramel
in
fact
it
seems
liek
your
drinking
caramel
at
a
certain
point
of
the
sip
slight
roast
to
the
malt
makes
for
a
very
interesting
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
motor
oil
props
on
doing
that
spaten
the
drinkability
for
me
at
least
is
fairly
low
the
sweetness
just
kinda
puts
you
off
that
its
a
beer
almost
meadlike
to
be
honest
one
of
these
babes
will
get
you
feeling
all
warm
inside
thats
for
sure
waitress
told
me
this
one
was
real
hoppy
which
im
going
to
call
bullshit
on

its

the

of
the

that
ive
had
very
deep
with

note
i
wrote
down
was
so
fruity
its
outrageous
what
a
wonderful
beer
i
like
the

more
personally
however
this
is
a
great
beer
wonderful

strong

a
good
doppelbock
i
have
found
it
to
be
very

flavor
with

towards
the
end
it
does
tapper
off
a
bit
and
thank
god
cuz
for
me
this
would
be
too
over
the
top
if
the
flavor
lasted
much
longer
so
while
its
a
good
oneoff
drinker
i
couldnt
see
ordering
another
in
one
sitting
malty
malt
malt
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
was
a
rich
garnet
color
with

fingers
head
and
little
lacing
not
good
as
describing
smells
but
this
one
says
drink
me
right
now
nice
sweetish
smell
this
not
my
style
but
i
really
like
this
one
goes
down
smooth
with
little
bitter
aftertaste
definitely
warms
the
belly
and
can
feel
the
high
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
since
not
my
style
it
wont
be
in
my
permanent
collection
but
definitely
earns
a
home
in
the
once
a
quarter
rotation
or
when
i
feel
like
a
darker
beer
3
0rbmlo
overall
i
do
think
this
is
a
superb
beer
a
bit
overwhelming
at
times
but
it
has
a
lot
of
good
things
going
for
it
everyone
should
at
least
give
it
a
try
especially
if
they
havent
had
a
doppelbock
before
ill
definitely
get
this
again
as
ive
done
in
the
past
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
with
a
giant
dirty
white
foamy
head
the
smell
is
a
little
light
with
only
malt
and
a
nutty
aroma
the
taste
has
dark
fruit
alcohol
sweet
malt
and
coffee
the
mf
is
medium
and
well
balanced
overall
this
is
a
goodnot
great
beer
i
would
give
it
a
try
again
let
me
start
by
saying
i
have
nothing
to
compare
this
to
style
wise
im
not
a
big
german
beer
drinker
but
have
been
trying
to
expand
my
horizons
a
bit
as
of
late
this
is
a
very
malty
beer
with
little
bitterness
it
is
a
bit
chewy
and
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
smell
is
not
strong
enough
for
my
liking
taste
is
good
but
not
great
overall
a
decent
beer
but
im
inclined
to
think
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
out
there
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
flat
with
little
or
no
head
when
put
up
to
light
a
dark
garnet
color
is
revealed
obviously
high
in
alcohol
7
2
abv
only
balanced
by
a
mixture
of
strong
malt
and
medium
hop
flavor
quite
drinkable
for
a
beer
so
high
in
alcohol
very
good
easily
more
than
two
bottles
can
be
had
at
a
sitting
dark
brown
with
red
hues
bubbly
head
and
some
nice
lacing
nose
is
malty
with
a
coffee
kick
maybe
some
raisins
tastes
like
raisin
coffee
hints
of
chocolate
and
roastedness
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
but
meaty
enough
pretty
drinkable
not
a
bad
brew
drinkability
a
nice
decent
affordable
and
the
most
readily
available
doppelbock
on
the
market
im
just
glad
that
since
it
was
in
a
green
bottle
the
store
didnt
keep
on
a
shelf
in
the
light
for
too
long
something
i
might
consider
buying
again
since
its
almost
everywhere
mouthfeeldrinkability
excellent
pinprickly
carbonation
that
virtually
disappears
during
the
swallow
really
one
of
the
most
noteworthy
attributes
of
this
beer
with
so
much
flavor
and
such
a
light
weight
in
the
mouth
it
strikes
a
match
with
german
sausage
and
other
light
but
flavorful
meat
dishes
nice
beer
overall
an
outstanding
beer
the
finish
is
syrupy
but
still
very
smooth
heavy
even
for
a
dopplebock
not
much
on
carbonation
but
still
a
winner
next
time
im
at
my
liquor
store
i
will
keep
my
optics
on
optimator
anyway
the
only
criticism
that
i
have
for
this
beer
is
the
long
and
syrupy
aftertaste
it
has
a
nice
feel
in
the
mouth
and
the
7
is
perfect
for
its
flavor
good
thickness
to
it
with
a
nice
finish
note
i
was
very
impressed
how
similar
this
beer
is
to
a
brazilian
beer
called
kaiser
bock
the
taste
is
very
similar
and
even
the
alcohol
level
is
the
same
72
that
shows
that
we
had
a
really
good
doppelbock
in
the
country
for
a
long
time
a
fantastic
dopplebock
one
i
will
use
as
a
standard
this
is
a
very
drinkable
offer
the
gentle
sweetness
and
the
medium
bitter
hops
work
in
unison
to
deliver
a
smooth
and
tasty
beer
spaten
has
had
ample
time
over
the
past
600
years
and
has
made
the
most
of
it
not
all
that
great
i
dont
see
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
all
in
all
very
drinkable
very
different
from
ayingers
celebrator
although
both
are
dominated
by
malt
flavor
this
is
less
creamy
than
the
ayinger
far
more
like
a
pilsener
and
the
balance
is
slightly
tilted
more
toward
the
acidic
100th
review
mediocre
beer
poured
a
deep
mahagony
color
with
massive
creamy
tannish
head
left
nice
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
dark
fruity
and
malty
taste
shows
more
of
the
malt
flavors
with
an
initail
strong
hop
presence
that
slowly
fades
to
present
a
nice
balancing
effect
as
the
beer
slowly
warms
nice
creamy
mouth
feel
with
a
slight
nate
of
alcohol
at
the
finish
nice
and
drinkable
very
enjoyable
while
ive
had
better
of
this
style
celebrator
comes
to
mind
i
prefer
it
over
other
standard
doppelbocks
such
as
paulaner
salvator
because
of
its
wellbalanced
taste
and
its
covering
of
the
alcohol
taste
appearance
is
deep
brown
body
without
the
slightest
haze
looks
like
thin
coffee
moderately
thick
whitish
head
that
laces
well
dark
malt
scents
sweet
with
plum
caramel
and
hints
of
strawberry
all
these
come
through
in
the
taste
as
well
especially
the
sweet
caramel
very
slightly
bready
and
a
hint
of
mushroom
that
makes
it
sound
nasty
but
its
really
just
a
nice
thick
earthy
taste
tingly
and
slightly
bitter
late
in
the
sip
sweetness
is
a
bit
too
prominent
in
the
aftertaste
to
be
superbly
drinkable
but
the
alcohol
is
very
well
concealed
one
of
these
is
enough
not
outstanding
the
smell
was
mostly
malt
with
a
trace
of
chocolate
it
tasted
very
malty
with
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
and
finished
with
trace
bitterness
it
was
creamy
but
not
as
thick
as
others
in
its
style
it
is
a
very
good
beer
and
one
that
will
stock
my
beer
fridge
goes
down
extremely
well
not
overly
heavy
nor
too
light
a
satisfying
and
comforting
beer
it
always
delivers
medium
body
with
decent
cleansing
power
overall
quite
drinkable
not
the
best
doppelbock
ive
had
but
certainly
good
enough
for
most
occasions
a
bit
watery
in
the
mouth
with
a
gentle
warming
as
it
leaves
with
a
tad
bit
of
a
sweet
finish
it
fits
its
style
i
preferred
the
celebrator
i
had
yesterday
over
this
one
however
not
bad
and
easy
to
drink
just
not
the
best
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
i
thank
the
strangers
in
that
bar
in
buffalo
for
introducing
me
to
optimator
its
certainly
not
the
best
doppelbock
around
but
its
hard
to
find
a
better
tasting
imported
doppelbock
at
this
price
d
three
of
these
are
all
i
can
drink
the
optimator
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
some
red
small
head
dissapates
to
almost
nothing
a
very
thin
ring
of
foam
remains
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
taste
is
of
sweet
caramel
fruity
plums
and
cherries
huge
malty
goodness
a
little
roasted
flavor
and
a
hint
of
warm
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
great
feels
like
a
full
bodied
strong
brew
for
a
doppelbock
and
especially
considering
the
abv
i
consider
this
a
highly
drinkable
brew
no
flavor
is
overwhelming
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
wish
there
was
a
bigger
head
on
this
brew
but
other
than
that
i
loved
it
germans
do
know
how
to
brew
oi
like
this
beer
alot
as
my
local
ba
bud
orionsbow
would
say
i
could
drink
the
snot
out
of
these
super
good
dopple
if
you
are
into
bock
beers
give
it
a
shot
the
abv
can
sneek
up
on
you
though
so
be
careful
if
you
are
easily
effected
ive
since
picked
up
a
6
pack
and
have
had
2
from
it
ive
enjoyed
them
as
much
as
the
first
one
and
everything
i
noticed
at
first
i
still
see
smell
taste
and
feel
really
a
unique
beer
spaten
optimator
is
presented
in
a
green
bottle
but
suffers
no
ill
effects
for
it
it
pours
a
deep
clear
reddishbrown
with
a
fine
light
tan
head
aroma
is
great
some
fruitiness
caramel
brown
sugar
maybe
some
maple
taste
is
malty
duh
but
with
a
very
complex
blend
of
flavors
molasses
toasted
nuts
some
sour
fruit
finish
is
surprisingly
dry
and
clean
but
of
course
there
are
still
some
sugars
left
over
medium
to
heavy
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
very
drinkable
but
shows
its
strength
as
well
a
classic
beer
drinkability
not
as
complex
as
other
doppelbocks
but
also
not
as
sweet
as
a
result
much
more
of
a
drinker
than
a
sipper
appeared
opaque
and
almost
black
in
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
that
was
thick
and
left
behind
a
touch
of
lacing
aromas
of
dark
fruits
roasted
nuts
and
malt
were
detectable
the
taste
was
sweet
with
a
blending
of
malt
flavors
with
fruit
undertones
somewhat
chewy
and
viscous
in
my
mouth
not
as
flavorful
or
as
complex
as
others
in
this
style
but
still
a
good
beer
i
wouldnt
want
another
one
for
some
time
optimator
pours
a
beautiful
reddish
brown
color
with
a
half
inch
head
that
lingers
in
the
glass
aroma
is
quite
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
in
the
nose
taste
is
very
malty
and
sweet
with
notes
of
caramel
chocolate
and
butterscotch
in
the
palate
i
could
taste
a
light
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
brew
is
quite
rich
and
full
bodied
this
an
excellent
doppelbock
and
one
of
the
better
priced
ones
at
that
6
99
for
a
sixer
of
this
wonderful
beer
is
hard
to
beat
poured
from
a
green
bottle
with
no
date
into
my
hb
mug
dark
brown
body
with
red
highlights
a
thin
creamy
tan
head
that
fades
fast
very
malty
sweet
aroma
like
a
lot
of
caramunich
malt
some
prunes
and
rasins
in
there
too
some
noble
hops
play
a
minor
roll
in
the
aroma
i
almost
think
i
can
smell
a
hint
of
mint
there
too
full
bodied
sweet
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
malt
and
some
kinda
nuttiness
finishes
with
a
grape
or
wine
taste
i
wouldnt
have
minded
to
have
another
but
i
only
had
one
bottle
taste
is
deep
warm
and
satisfying
its
very
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
if
i
could
change
anything
i
would
have
just
a
little
more
carbonation
good
but
by
no
means
great
overall
this
is
a
wellbalanced
and
smooth
beer
it
has
a
good
deal
of
fullness
but
is
easy
to
enjoy
at
the
same
time
a
very
nice
representation
of
the
style
o
a
beer
with
a
wellknown
name
and
a
long
history
its
definitely
one
to
try
if
you
hope
to
know
the
classic
beers
and
this
one
definitely
falls
in
that
category
a
good
drinking
dopplebock
i
will
revisit
this
one
again
good
brown
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
lots
of
lacing
from
this
brew
very
sweet
malt
smell
as
expected
slight
alcohol
smell
with
no
hops
present
large
sweet
malt
taste
with
milky
watered
down
coffee
taste
and
feel
a
tad
bit
thin
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
it
certainly
doesnt
top
the
doppelbock
list
for
me
d
this
is
a
good
malty
lager
that
has
nice
complexity
and
really
accents
the
depth
of
malt
with
some
nice
hops
to
keep
them
in
check
overall
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
fits
inbetween
a
lighter
lager
and
the
heavier
dopplebocks
not
quite
a
slow
sipper
but
not
an
easy
drinker
either
d
goes
down
easily
not
too
sweet
not
to
dry
smooth
and
simple
a
high
quality
ofest
malted
up
a
notch
pretty
drinkable
but
i
consider
this
the
low
end
of
the
dopplebock
spectrum
abvwise
yummy
just
the
same
just
didnt
quite
come
together
from
the
crtical
beer
drinkerss
view
point
enjoy
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinker
for
a
doppelbock
i
was
surprised
by
what
i
perceived
to
be
a
lack
of
complexity
on
the
palate
all
in
all
not
bad
but
not
great
drinkability
deceptively
easy
to
drink
which
is
bad
considering
the
alcohol
content
of
this
beer
however
for
this
beer
i
consider
this
a
negative
trait
as
i
like
my
doppelbocks
to
be
a
little
bigger
feeling
if
you
will
this
beer
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
it
is
a
little
high
in
alcohol
but
the
flavor
is
not
overly
aggressive
this
beer
is
pretty
good
on
tap
rathskeller
in
indy
tawny

brown
nearly
black
in

tan
head
disappeared
quickly
big
malty

roasty

big

flavors
slightly
roasty
caramel

like
flavors
bitterness
is
held
back
pretty
well
although
there
are
some
grassy
hop
flavors
medium
to
full

low
carbonation
pretty
good
dopplebock
i
ordered
this
on
tap
but
they
brought
me
a
bottle
instead
even
though
th
ebeer
menu
spcifically
said
it
was
on
tap
they
didnt
even
offer
to
bring
me
something
else
oh
well
i
drank
it
any
way
this
is
the
first
doppelbock
ive
reviewed
lots
and
lots
of
malt
the
head
was
lightbrown
firm
with
great
lacing
sweet
malt
is
almost
overpowering
but
good
drinkability
this
would
be
a
5
if
it
werent
for
the
slightly
elevated
abv
a
sumptuous
and
very
drinkable
brew
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
not
too
much
of
anythinghahaha
this
was
my
first
review
on
here
ever
i
gave
in
a
nearperfect
score
lol
this
is
the
beer
that
got
me
into
beer
so
it
will
always
be
remembered
and
its
a
decent
beer
but
experience
has
shown
its
nothing
too
special
either
a
decent
dopplebock
drinkability
declines
sharply
about
34
of
the
way
through
the
bottle
though
d
i
have
been
impressed
by
this
beer
and
could
enjoy
it
often
though
considering
better
examples
of
the
style
are
easy
to
find
dont
know
how
often
i
will
yum
yum
one
of
the
first
imported
beers
i
ever
tried
and
i
havent
had
it
in
ages
though
i
remember
it
being
one
of
the
best
beers
id
had
at
the
time
its
far
more
interesting
this
time
around
poured
a
rich
cola
color
and
formed
a
head
that
faded
quickly
with
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
was
of
malt
brown
sugar
and
floral
hops
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
almost
remind
me
of
a
pilsner
which
make
this
an
easy
to
drink
beer
its
not
as
syrupy
as
paulaner
salvador
or
as
celebrator
but
in
the
same
sence
it
does
not
have
as
much
flavor
as
those
doppelbocks
do
this
is
ok
for
me
because
i
can
easily
consume
more
than
one
per
session
overall
i
think
this
is
the
most
drinkable
doppelbock
i
have
tried
but
not
the
most
flavorful
cheers
poured
a
warm
reddishbrown
practically
reminiscent
of
cocacola
from
a
green
bottle
into
a
pint
glassleft
a
thick
and
foamy
offwhite
twofinger
head
which
gradually
fell
to
a
thin
lace
sweeter
than
expected
combined
with
a
heavy
dark
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
caramel
with
little
or
no
hops
of
mention
this
particular
doppelbock
is
smoother
than
silk
although
not
bashful
of
its
alcohol
content
whatsoever
is
exceptionally
drinkable
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
the
spaten
line
in
the
near
future
not
as
good
as
celebrator
but
also
about
half
the
price
id
buy
it
again
it
smells
sweeter
than
the
average
beer
but
doesnt
taste
too
sweet
and
definitely
doesnt
taste
bitter
at
all
optimator
has
a
very
malty
taste
a
little
sweet
a
little
bite
but
fairly
potent
at
7
2
abv
once
i
start
drinking
it
i
have
a
very
hard
time
stopping
a
sixpack
is
perfect
after
a
hard
day
of
work
when
your
thirst
needs
quenching
and
you
need
to
get
a
nice
buzz
on
overall
a
decent
example
of
the
style
in
decent
shape
i
wish
spaten
would
go
to
brown
bottles
really
a
fantastic
beer
malt
an
amazing
beer
if
you
want
something
big
and
malty
without
having
to
have
a
hop
attack
wonderfully
balanced
and
not
cloying
in
the
slightest
like
some
doppelbocks
straightforward
and
delicious
for
a
higher
abv
and
richer
malty
style
optimator
comes
through
in
the
clutch
for
its
drinkability
wont
be
too
heavy
on
the
stomach
while
still
providing
an
alcohol
warming
that
is
right
on
give
it
a
few
minutes
to
warm
up
and
the
nose
breaks
loose
there
are
better
doppelbocks
out
there
but
you
wont
be
disappointed
with
optimator
not
my
most
favorite
dopplebock
drinkability
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
throughout
a
good
doppelbock
and
easily
drinkable
as
much
as
i
love
hops
i
love
me
a
malty
beer
drinkability
a
decent
doppelbock
for
sure
though
with
the
sweetness
and
the
brew
being
a
bit
unbalanced
i
dont
know
how
often
id
have
it
among
other
dbocks
to
choose
from
pretty
drinkable
goes

i
had
this

maybe
it

just
that
nothing
stood
out
maybe
i
was
just
in
a
weird

my
dog
had
just
eaten
my

maybe
the

just
wasnt
anything
special
this
beer
again
was
okay
it
hit
the
low

i
have
for
craft
beer
is
it
a

no
then
its
okay
ill
drink
it
this
pours
a
medium

color
with
not
too
much
of
a

the
aroma
is
very
malty
the
flavor
is
very
well
balanced
with
a
delicious
toasted

flavor
and
a
bit
of
carbonation
to
give
it
some
volume
probably
one
of
the
better
seasonal
offerings
from
sprechers
overall
very
nicely
made
overall
a

the

not

but
pretty

good
i
have
had
several
great
sprecher
beers
most
notable
the
russion
imperial
stout
and
black
bavarian
but
this
wont
find
its
way
back
into
our
house
d
ive
had
it
before
and
been
more
pleased
maybe
it
was
the
batch
and
maybe
the
small
batch
difference
is
why
i
cant
write
more
to
its
praise
still
i
aint
dumping
it
down
the
drain
not
that
i
would
any
beer
actually
after
a
glass
it
seems
a
little
more
satisfying
just
not
quite
drinkability
suffers
a
little
from
the
noticeable
alcohol
and
from
the
slightly
excessive
bitterness
on
the
backend
not
that
its
not
drinkable
but
its
definitely
not
something
id
go
for
more
than
one
of
at
a
sitting
thanks
to
beerfmandy
for
this
extra
decent
beer
probably
my
favorite
of
the
style
so
far
and
i
will
admit
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
in
general
recommend
d
tasty
brew
would
definitely
buy
again
dont
know
if
i
would
want
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
session
but
very
enjoyable
although
a
lot
of
the
bock
and
dopplebock
beers
taste
the
same
to
me
this
is
the
time
of
the
year
to
have
them
as
the
days
are
milder
and
the
nights
are
cool
this
beer
fits
the
season
well
since
its
dark
strong
but
not
heavy
and
warming
like
other
dark
styles
are
while
nothing
in
particular
stands
out
about
this
its
worth
finding
if
this
style
is
up
your
alley
d
good
d
a
solid
dopplebock
that
is
perhaps
one
of
my
seasonal
favorites
from
sprecher
a
good
drinker
for
a
style
that
i
usually
dont
typically
find
very
drinkable
definitely
one
i
will
always
look
forward
to
each
fall
after
getting
it
home
i
let
it
be
for
about
24
hours
then
cracked
it
open
and
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
still
had
good
carbonation
and
produced
a
nice
foamy
halfinch
head
dark
amber
in
color
very
malty
very
high
alcohol
content
but
with
a
misleading
sweetness
i
could
have
finished
the
entire
jug
on
my
own
if
i
hadnt
reminded
myself
that
i
had
a
paper
due
the
next
day
not
a
bad
brew
a
lot
of
interesting
and
complex
flavors
going
on
plently
of
superior
brews
out
there
but
this
one
is
worth
a
try
dit
is
very
drinkable
i
am
a
bock
alt
fan
and
would
like
to
expierence
more
of
them
my
first
experience
with
this
doppel
was
at

primarily
drank
the
doppel
also
tried

possibly
the
best

d
this
is
an
easy

dopplebock
with
a
wellconcealed
abv
especially
for
the
style
next
to
the
black
bavarian
this
might
be
the
best
brew
ive
sampled
from
sprecher
thus
far
d
this
beer
certainly
has
its
place
but
when
it
comes
to
drinkability
in
quantities
more
than
one
you
may
want
to
look
elsewhere
its
definitely

i
really

d
im

the
fact
that
i
havent
had
a

one
of
my
favorite
styles
in
a

but
this
is
nevertheless
a
really
tasty
beer
this
was
perfect
for
a
rainy
and
slightly
cool
day
like
today
first
beer
from

and
got
it
because
it
was

to
try
new
beers
from
this
brewery
might
drink
again
recommended
to
try
once
at
least
note
to
self
visit
brother
more
often
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
since
it
is
so
sweet
and
raisiny
but
it
was
pretty
tasty
nonetheless
a
little
too
thin
for
my
liking
but
damn
if
i
dont
love
the
flavor
for
my
money
sprecher
and
their
brothers
at
capital
are
churning
out
the
best
german
beer
outside
of
the
rheinland
d
overall
i
think
its
a
really
good
beer
the
taste
makes
up
for
some
of
its
flaws
easy
to
drink
id
like
to
delve
more
into
this
one
drinkability
is
good
the
high
alcohol
makes
this
one
a
good
warming
winter
brew
but
may
shy
some
drinkers
away
all
in
all
this
is
a
solid
doppelbock
on
the
upper
half
of
the
bell
curve
another
solid
brew
from
sprecher
cheers
drinks
fairly
slow
would
try
this
again
closer
the
source
obtained
from
liqorama
bit
i
rate
this
a
pedestrian
db
at
best
i
do
wonder
if
its
a
bit
old
no
matter
dbs
should
hold
up
a
must
try
if
you
like
the
style
sprechers
dopple
bock
went
very
nicely
with
a
couple
pieces
of
fudge
for
future
reference
the
16
oz
bottle
poured
well
into
the
pint
glass
a
nearly
black
hue
leaving
little
froth
but
giving
lots
for
the
nose
to
contemplateplenty
of
chocolate
caramel
and
yeasty
good
tidings
the
taste
is
rich
and
smooth
smoother
than
many
dopples
in
fact
and
somewhat
though
a
little
less
comparable
to
sam
adams
firstrate
double
bock
i
also
get
a
nice
hint
of
berry
decent
carbonation
deprives
this
of
what
would
be
a
better
mouthfeel
but
this
is
a
terrific
beer
a
great
dopplebock
with
sweets
on
a
very
cold
midwestern
day
cheers
i
think
this
style
gets
extra
points
and
there
is
a
narrow
range
on
the
main
suppliers
of
it
not
always
deserved
yes
this
particular
beer
was
roasted
and
gave
off
a
roasted
and
licorice
aroma
and
was
black
and
in
fact
smooth
mouthfeel
but
it
was
fairly
ordinary
and
certainly
a
bomber
was
too
much
i
have
enjoyed
this
style
produced
by
others
drinkability
remarkably
tasty
so
good
the
police
got
involved
the
taste
was
very
nice
real
smooth
and
chocolatey
not
a
lot
of
complexity
there
but
very
nice
it
had
a
mediumheavy
body
for
a
lager
and
the
carbonation
enhanced
that
a
bit
as
well
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
nice
beer
i
gotta
start
hitting
up
friends
more
often
to
bring
back
new
beers
when
they
travel
poured
this
one
out
of
the
bomber
that
has
thick
brown
waxlike
sealing
the
top
which
made
it
hard
to
even
get
it
open
but
when
open
finally
pured
with
a
rich
brown
bubbly
head
that
lingers
matly
nose
with
some
of
the
8
alcohol
showing
up
and
a
bit
of
spice
like
anisefairly
sharp
creamy
chocolate
taste
and
extremely
smooth
the
kind
of
smooth
that
i
imagine
got
people
to
switch
to
lagers
from
ale
once
upon
a
time
but
in
spite
of
the
exceptional
smoothness
the
beer
isnt
light
in
the
mouth
but
very
solid
and
full
beer
is
good
happy
doppel
beering
a
big
and
hearty
beer
i
guess
its
pretty
good
pretty
hardcharging
alcohol
if
in
the
mood
for
doppelbock
though
i
may
go
a
different
route
dopple
bock
may
not
be
sprechers
finest
accomplishment
see
black
bavarian
but
its
a
damn
fine
beer
in
its
own
right
i
wonder
for
the
millionth
time
why
the
wisconsin
breweries
dont
distribute
to
this
state
when
were
a
mere
mississippi
rivers
width
away
the
sprecher
dopple
bock
pours
a
deep
copper
and
has
very
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
bright
for
this
style
and
resonates
of
a
deeper
substance
flavor
is
really
pleasing
cocoa
hints
as
well
as
coffee
with
a
slightly
nutty
finish
this
beer
strikes
a
unique
balance
of
interest
and
style
one
of
sprechers
best
d
a
little
too
sweet
and
lackluster
to
be
really
enjoyable
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
tinge
of
alcohol
and
ripe
figplum
characteristics
very
smooth
and
satisfying
with
a
warming
sensation
as
the
temperature
rises
another
winner
from
sprecher
not
the
most
complex
of
beers
but
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
small
light
beige
head
that
disappears
quickly
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
and
fruit
thick
rich
sweet
malty
taste
along
with
some
molasses
and
caramel
flavors
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
also
present
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
but
the
body
is
much
lighter
than
other
doppelbocks
ive
had
a
warming
alcohol
bite
is
noticeable
as
it
goes
down
this
one
is
worth
finding
dont
be
put
off
by
the
weak
nose
the
taste
more
than
makes
up
fo
it
drinkability
not
a
bad
doppelbock
with
good
sweet
malts
and
toffee
profiles
but
the
imbalance
with
the
booze
and
odd
thinness
leave
this
a
little
harder
to
drink
than
other
doppelbocks
however
the
woman
i
spoke
to
from
sprecher
said
that
the
brewer
was
working
on
the
recipe
so
this
is
a
beer
ill
return
to
this
is
definitely
one
to
try
though
it
doesnt
stand
up
to
german
or
other
wisconsin
doppels
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
features
but
they
are
balanced
by
just
as
many
offflavors
drink
nice
and
easy
not
too
thick
but
loaded
with
flavour
i
like
deep
crimson
color
with
moderate
carbonation
showing
a
bit
of
a
nutty
caramel
aroma
with
some
burn
but
its
none
of
the
flavors
are
too
prominent
in
the
smell
taste
is
loaded
with
malts
and
rich
deep
dark
malts
at
that
lots
of
plummyness
here
quite
figgy
with
toffee
undertones
a
shot
of
some
liquer
thrown
in
the
initial
roastiness
subsides
to
a
creamy
feel
at
the
top
the
finish
comes
back
with
some
roasty
and
spicy
notes
but
the
maltiness
is
always
there
intriguing
tasty
quite
good
those
wisconsin
brewers
can
sure
brew
their
lagers
right
pours
a
deep
dark
blackish
ruby
with
a
decent
white
head
shrinking
to
a
thin
film
with
lacing
in
thick
sheets
cascading
down
strings
catching
on
the
glass
here
and
there
aroma
is
slighly
sweet
toffee
on
top
of
heavy
malt
base
some
toffee
and
caramel
hints
taste
is
heavily
malty
nice
hints
of
toffee
and
even
brown
sugar
can
slightly
get
alcohol
hints
in
both
taste
and
aroma
nice
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
just
good
all
around
no
weaknesses
but
no
real
strong
points
mouthfeel
what
a
nice
blend
of
dark
and
sweet
and
bitter
and
sweet
definetly
an
american
interpretation
of
the
german
dopplebock
but
very
well
done
i
must
say
pours
out
a
dark
dense
brown
with
a
good
offwhite
head
leaving
great
lacing
great
malty
aromas
with
hints
of
caramel
big
but
balanced
mouthfeel
with
a
hint
of
sourness
of
dark
fruits
as
it
warms
it
gives
off
even
more
spiciness
one
of
the
finest
dopple
bocks
ive
tasted
16
ounce
bottle
pours
out
a
dark
brown
color
topped
with
a
couple
inches
of
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
somewhat
roasty
a
little
bit
of
a
sour
smell
in
the
background
chewy
malt
flavor
slightly
metallic
hops
are
there
but
not
too
strong
finishes
spicy
and
fruity
like
the
aroma
the
flavor
has
a
sourness
lurking
in
the
background
thick
chewy
mouthfeel
no
sign
of
the
nearly
8
abv
pretty
good
drinkability
if
it
werent
for
the
sourness
this
would
be
an
excellent
dopplebock
drinkability
16oz
is
the
ideal
serving
size
deep
chestnut
with
a
thin
but
full
tan
crown
very
belgiany
lively
flavorful
yeast
vinous
in
the
extreme
for
a
bock
dark
fruit
front
toffee
middle
and
spicycitric
hop
finish
that
improves
as
the
beer
warms
very
drinkable
for
a
bock
as
well
a
tad
thin
but
still
creamy
enough
to
be
enjoyable
medium
bodied
still
a
fairly
rich
brew
at
1
70
for
a
pint
bottle
it
wont
break
the
bank
drinkability
and
notes

this
is
a
solid
beer
with
good
drinkability
however
there
is
a
lot
of
room
for
improvement
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
could
use
some
work
as
well
as
some
added
complexity
and
power
in
the
aroma
and
taste
still
one
of
the
better
american
doppelbocks
i
have
had
and
a
pretty
good
deal
for
the
price
this
was
particularly
disappointing
after
being
really
impressed
by
sprechers
black
bavarian
pours
a
hazy
bright
dark
amberbrown
with
a
decent
foamy
lasting
off
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
in
my
glass
has
a
sweet
fruity
and
bready
aroma
sweet
and
malty
fruity
and
caramel
flavors
medium
body
with
a
slick
and
smooth
mouthfeel
finishes
sweet
alcohol
well
hidden
very
nice
i
continue
to
be
surprised
by
this
brewery
maybe
because
i
bought
a
mixed
fourpack
for
2
95
but
this
stuff
is
great
surprisingly
authentic
tasting
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
some
crimson
shining
through
and
a
white
creamy
head
i
love
the
milky
creamy
tastes
and
smells
coming
from
this
beer
theres
also
a
decent
amount
of
complexity
in
the
taste
first
of
all
its
a
malt
explosion
soft
and
sweet
for
the
most
part
but
a
bit
of
bitter
coffee
been
rounding
out
the
finish
theres
a
nice
almost
merlot
character
to
this
beer
which
im
finding
quite
nice
a
great
dopplebock
from
a
great
brewery
pours
a
dark
crimson
ruby
color
with
large
tan
head
the
carbonation
slowly
fades
away
smells
of
caramel
and
roasty
definitely
sweet
and
fruity
taste
is
sweet
and
resinous
but
not
thick
dark
fruits
and
caramel
dominate
the
taste
with
some
residual
bitterness
at
the
end
but
not
much
a
little
bit
of
the
yeast
profile
shows
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
is
not
thick
but
not
too
thin
on
target
for
the
style
very
drinkable
one
of
sprechers
better
brews
and
a
top
notch
dbock
cloudy
medium
brown
boasts
a
lasting
offwhite
head
excitingly
vinous
aroma
full
on
the
currants
and
blackberries
jam
flavors
sweet
iced
tea
like
caramelic
malt
comprises
a
generous
roasted
raisin
bread
overtone
nutty
with
more
roasted
candies
and
pumpernickel
complexities
all
while
deploying
a
savant
fruit
knowledge
fitting
lagerish
body
with
moderate
carbonation
may
not
carry
it
to
excellence
but
doesnt
affect
negatively
either
remarkable
take
on
the
style
mostly
due
to
its
unique
deep
roastiness
a
surprise
of
a
dopple
for
sure
this
beer
poured
out
very
dark
with
a
small
amount
of
head
i
couldnt
decipher
the
bottled
on
dates
of
these
bottles
but
i
will
guess
they
are
over
a
year
old
but
i
didnt
notice
any
ill
affects
because
of
that
fact
the
taste
was
very
malty
but
not
with
the
syrupy
brown
sugar
flavors
that
many
young
dopples
have
a
dryer
more
porter
like
flavor
with
increased
acidity
and
coffee
flavors
alcohol
is
very
present
mouthfeel
is
right
on
and
i
proved
to
myself
that
the
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
one
of
my
favoirte
offerings
from
this
brewery
get
it
if
you
can
find
it
as
i
have
said
before
sprecher
doesnt
have
the
ability
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
they
are
truly
one
of
the
greatest
lowpriced
breweries
in
the
country
this
seasonal
dopplebock
was
decent
overall
but
didnt
have
the
normalities
that
i
look
for
in
a
dopple
bock
it
seemed
a
little
too
dark
for
this
style
it
was
remnant
of
a
porter
in
both
appearance
and
taste
the
was
a
nutty
roasted
presence
that
seemed
a
little
offbalance
but
the
finish
was
very
nice
and
malty
a
great
seasonal
that
is
definately
worth
a
try
the
beer
pours
a
chestnut
hue
with
garnet
tints
and
develops
a
light
beige
head
that
fades
quickly
to
an
edge
layer
mild
toffee
aroma
and
some
general
fruitiness
mixed
in
berries
and
pears
i
think
first
sip
reveals
a
small
yet
prickly
carbonation
and
average
body
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
sugary
up
front
with
toffee
and
brown
sugar
dominant
some
ripe
fruit
as
well
the
finish
is
rather
dry
and
allows
some
hints
of
vanilla
there
is
a
bit
of
a
sweet
coating
on
my
tongue
after
the
swallow
almost
a
syrupy
feel
to
it
overall
a
very
nice
brew
and
easy
to
drink
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
one
bottle
the
carbonation
was
quite
bitey
up
front
mediumbodied
throughout
w
a
nice
sweet
alcohol
burn
at
the
end
drinkability
was
pretty
decent
not
my
favorite
dopplebock
by
any
means
but
a
nice
find
as
well
sprecher
beer
has
always
been
available
at
the
airport
in
milwaukee
and
has
been
there
to
keep
me
company
in
flight
delays
i
was
very
happy
when
this
beer
became
available
here
in
ma
this
dopplebock
has
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
medium
tan
head
not
too
much
lace
a
candy
malty
aroma
from
the
roasted
malt
dominates
the
nose
a
thick
rich
malty
taste
with
a
light
alcohol
back
no
hops
to
be
found
in
the
flavor
heavy
mouth
feel
with
a
great
drinkability
many
dopples
are
dominated
by
alcohol
this
one
really
puts
the
malt
forward
nice
beer
drinkability
a
little
light
for
my
liking
giving
this
beer
questionable
drinkability
considering
the
style
a
good
beer
but
not
a
paulaner
salvator
either
overall
nice
complexity
and
balance
brownburgandy
fairly
clear
not
much
in
the
way
of
head
whats
there
certainly
fades
quickly
caramel
and
sweet
wet
malts
deep
down
theres
an
almost
fruity
sensation
that
reminds
me
of
a
squished
fig
newton
smacks
of
roasted
bitterness
in
the
middle
through
the
end
somehow
remains
light
and
drinkable
stays
very
smooth
even
through
the
hop
bitterness
never
gets
astringent
something
ive
found
common
in
some
bock
and
dopplebock
beers
that
are
trying
too
hard
for
balance
just
a
trickling
of
prune
juice
across
the
tongue
washed
away
by
more
dominant
pure
malt
flavors
quite
a
nice
doppelbock
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
inch
tall
beige
head
would
like
a
bit
longer
head
retention
time
but
for
a
dopplebock
well
forgive
and
move
on
amazingly
deeply
reddish
brown
in
shade
a
thing
of
beauty
in
front
of
the
light
heavy
malt
nose
with
alcohol
apparent
sweet
malty
flavor
with
undercurrent
of
berries
or
cherries
and
that
alcohol
that
was
present
in
the
nose
is
only
found
here
in
the
warming
feelings
of
the
mouth
and
tummy
exactly
what
im
looking
for
in
a
dopplebock
mouthfeel
is
excellent
as
well
and
the
drinkability
drops
down
just
a
tad
because
although
i
want
more
and
more
i
know
itll
kick
my
ass
later
so
glad
sprecher
is
now
getting
distributed
in
ma
thanks
to
an
exceptionally
patient
bighuge
for
this
one
cheers
to
zap

letting
me

this
enjoyable

goes
quickly

the

big
thanks
to
jeffboo
for
the
bottle
had
this
on
tap
at

in
indy
poured
a
deep
brown
with
ruby
red
hues
not
much
head
but
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
was
malty
sweet
with
a
hint
of
fruit
thrown
in
add
to
that
a
touch
of
the
hops
taste
is
oh
so
good
malty
sweet
but
not
overly
so
with
a
little
tanginess
that
really
balances
it
out
however
the
mild
carbonation

strikes
me

i
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
doppelbocks
i
have
had
poured
a
rich
dark

really

i

would
make
my

definitely
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
truly
disgusting
the
label
is
the
best
part
enjoyed
from
the
12
oz
bottle
in
a

this
unique

a
mild

character
on

goodness
very
coating
wet
aftertaste
never
seen
one
like
this
before
and
truly
enjoyed
its
flavors
of
rich
coffee
being
a
strong
black
coffee
drinker
a
good
finisher
for
an
evening
mouthfeel
is
light
but
a
little
oily
overall
its
not
bad
my
wife
and
i
agree
that
theres
nothing
outstanding
or
offensive
about
it
o
a
good
beer
probably
wont
be
getting
again
though
medium
brown
color
very
carbonated
pour
very
odd
aroma
reminds
me
of
a
hot
sauce
smell
tastes
fine
a
little
coffee
flavor
comes
through
over
the
caramel
taste
if
the
body
this
beer
is
just
ok
o
this
should
be
called
a
breakfast
doppelbock
the
coffee
certainly
takes
the
lead
before
malt
heaven
shares
the
dance
very
nice
perkulator
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
nice
lacing
head
there
is
a
strong
coffee
aroma
the
taste
has
a
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
big
coffee
flavor
the
taste
is
very
full
and
complete
with
a
great
feel
perfectly
carbonated
with
nice
strong
flavors
overall
its
a
big
coffee
flavored
beer
overall
i
am
impressed
i
used
to
disdain
bocks
in
general
this
may
have
reopened
my
mind
to
them
thanks
dark
horse
i
should
have
figured
dark
horse
wouldnt
let
me
down
despite
the
disappointing
aroma
the
coffee
grounds
as
opposed
to
full
coffee
beans
give
an
interesting
coffee
flavor
thats
not
often
found
in
coffee
beers
its
more
gritty
tasting
this
really
as
excellent
coffee
infused
beer
combined
with
a
nice
choice
in
style
the
dopplebock
and
coffee
combination
is
brilliant
as
the
sweet
malts
and
bitter
coffee
grounds
come
together
to
make
a
beer
that
drinks
awesomely
and
tastes
even
better
o
likely
a
contaminated
bottle
1st
such
ever
from
dark
horse
will
rereview
with
another
bottle
from
a
different
source
similar
characterization
but
more
positive
in
2nd
sample
stale
coffee
grinds
in
aroma
with
notably
better
flavor
o
not
my
favorite
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
expect
and
was
left
a
little
disappointed
the
coffee
was
not
as
present
as
i
would
have
liked
overall
i
think
this
was
a
refreshing
take
on
an
old
style
of
beer
wouldnt
say
this
was
the
best
doppelbock
out
there
but
i
am
slightly
biased
towards
coffee
beers
drinks
easily
for
7
abv
not
available
locally
but
hoping
to
revisit
this
one
in
the
future
a
good
interesting
effort
with
some
clean
up
fill
out
the
body
and
cut
down
the
carbonation
and
make
the
dopplebock
aspects
stronger
this
could
be
an
amazing
beer
dopplebock
character
surfaces
far
more
in
flavor
than
aroma
which
pleases
me
took
5
minutes
to
pour
the
damn
beer
but
it
was
worth
it
im
not
a
huge
coffee
fan
but
the
sweet
nutty
malt
and
chocolate
won
me
over
pours
a
brown
body
with
decent
head
and
some
lace
aroma
is
coffee
dominant
with
touches
of
roasted
malts
caramel
and
bread
beer
is
dry
and
fuller
bodied
not
so
chewy
and
while
alright
to
drink
with
touches
of
sweetness
the
coffee
is
too
dominant
for
my
liking
this
isnt
a
criticism
of
the
beer
as
much
as
my
personal
preference
since
im
not
a
regular
coffee
drinker
at
all
to
me
at
least
the
balance
is
off
as
the
coffee
aspect
of
this
beer
overpowers
all
the
other
aspects
of
the
beer
which
is
sort
of
the
point
pours
from
a
bottle
with
a
light
brown
almost
coffee
colored
color
and
a
healthy
tan
foam
head
has
a
nice
coffee
aroma
flavor
is
a
strong
coffee
with
some
dark
chocolate
and
toasted
malts
body
has
a
light
to
medium
feel
but
is
smooth
and
goes
down
nice
this
is
an
excellent
coffee
brew
d
a
good
coffee
beer
without
a
doubt
interesting
use
of
a
doppelbock
as
the
backdrop
but
i
certainly
dig
it
the
doppel
is
not
overbearing
and
lets
the
coffee
do
most
of
the
shining
give
it
a
go
if
you
dig
the
coffee
brews
overall
an
okay
brew
a
bit
harsh
on
the
coffee
flavor
and
underdone
on
the
doppelbock
backbone
maybe
the
size
of
this
doppelbock
needed
to
be
a
bit
higher
to
compensate
the
coffee
based
on
this
experience
i
am
altering
my
ratings
thus
a
4
753
75
s
3754
much
more
coffee
than
dopplebock
and
its
very
strange
how
my
senses
both
smell
and
taste
perceive
anaheim
chiles
in
the
mix
but
all
around
enjoyable
provided
you
like
coffee
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
just
wish
the
smell
had
less
burnt
coffee
and
poured
with
less
head
the
head
has
an
incredibly
burnt
coffee
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
medium
bodied
carbonation
was
just
right
a
slight
bite
funny
that
the
name
is
perkulator
because
this
beer
tastes
just
like
my
moms
coffee
that
she
made
and
still
makes
in
her
60s
percolator
i
really
want
to
like
this
beer
i
think
it
is
probably
a
good
recipe
but
the
carbonation
is
an
issue
hopefully
it
was
just
my
bottle
or
my
batch
and
not
how
the
beer
is
intended
without
the
fizz
it
would
be
a
really
nice
coffee
beer
overall
might
be
hard
to
improve
on
a
great
style
like
a
dopplebock
though
it
did
smell
pretty
nice
overall
this
is
a
coffee
lovers
beer
you
can
drink
this
repeatedly
and
get
a
steady
dose
of
coffee
flavor
that
is
usually
reserved
for
breakfast
and
coffee
stouts
and
best
of
all
you
get
it
with
only
7
abv
a
brown
ale
base
to
a
dopplebock
lager
with
a
boatload
of
coffee
flavor
how
can
you
go
wrong
on
tap
at
j
ryans
in
at
least
a
partial
dark
horse
tap
takeover
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
them
pale
caramel
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
yeast
in
suspension
and
an
inch
of
cream
foam
the
nose
is
coffee
heavy
with
some
darker
german
malts
and
chocolate
malts
smells
like
a
brown
ale
more
than
a
dopplebock
but
its
a
good
fusion
on
the
malt
front
the
coffee
isnt
a
dominant
flavor
while
its
prominent
its
also
in
balance
with
the
sweeter
grain
bill
and
with
the
other
elements
at
work
here
which
are
earthy
and
dusty
and
wintery
all
feelings
more
than
flavors
but
present
to
varying
degrees
as
clear
as
day
no
acidity
at
all
form
the
coffee
plenty
of
cocoa
notes
in
the
finish
too
a
great
combination
of
flavors
a
little
more
nuanced
than
a
lot
of
coffee
beers
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
too
much
body
to
be
all
day
drinkable
but
i
really
like
whats
going
on
here
horrible
i
did
not
finish
the
bottle
unfortunately
i
have
another
bottle
that
i
bought
at
woodmans
in
the
1
per
bottle
mix
sixpack
pile
hopefully
it
is
from
a
better
batch
not
traditional
by
any
stretch
but
an
easy
recommend
for
the
strong
coffee
stout
lover
if
you
like
em
to
be
all
about
the
coffee
as
do
i
you
will
love
this
one
i
like
the
body
to
be
bigger
in
a
doppel
but
it
holds
its
own
ultimately
its
about
medium
in
strength
fairly
dry
not
overly
crisp
but
slightly
more
than
it
is
smooth
decent
doppelbock
that
is
ruined
by
the
coffee
gimmick
some
breweries
just
dont
get
it
dont
mess
with
classic
styles
the
doppelbock
style
is
about
malt
not
added
spices
and
flavorings
at
least
dont
try
to
call
it
a
doppelbock
if
youre
going
to
brew
something
as
mediocre
as
this
beer
2
as
a
traditional
doppelbock
this
was
not
even
close
but
as
a
coffee
beer
this
stuff
is
the
tops
if
you
are
into
coffee
beers
this
is
a
must
d
this
was
gross
not
sure
if
it
was
just
a
bad
bottle
or
if
this
beer
is
always
nasty
but
i
didnt
like
anything
about
the
scent
or
taste
or
body
tough
to
choke
this
down
might
be
a
drain
pour
one
of
a
few
random
dark
horse
bottles
that
i
picked
up
without
having
tried
before
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
pours
a
mediumdark
brown
color
with
an
opaque
body
there
was
a
crazy
amount
of
head
development
as
i
poured
but
that
dissipated
after
about
10
minutes
and
there
wound
up
being
not
much
lacing
the
smell
is
mild
with
the
coffee
and
malt
coming
through
in
equal
proportions
the
taste
leans
heavily
to
the
coffee
and
i
really
enjoy
that
aspect
its
not
terribly
complex
but
it
doesnt
need
to
be
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
odd
but
its
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
the
reason
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
dopplebocks
can
be
rather
unassuming
but
i
think
the
coffee
addition
makes
this
beer
stand
out
o
i
liked
this
beer
as
a
novelty
even
though
its
listed
as
a
doppelbock
im
not
sure
it
really
belongs
there
given
its
characteristics
then
again
im
not
sure
what
it
would
fit
into
decent
but
there
is
something
about
the
mouthfeel
that
is
holding
me
back
from
rating
this
one
higher
i
have
been
down
on
dark
horse
lately
ive
sent
some
bottles
out
in
trades
to
people
who
expressed
mild
disappointment
in
them
and
while
i
like
pt5
and
bbpt5
i
dont
like
them
as
much
as
the
masses
and
dont
see
what
the
fuss
is
all
about
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
though
and
it
has
me
reconsidering
dh
as
an
upperechelon
brewery
the
feel
is
nicely
slick
almost
viscous
or
creamy
with
a
dry
feel
too
this
holds
a
lot
of
schizophrenia
like
qualities
which
makes
it
a
truly
interesting
beer
the
flavor
of
coffee
works
for
the
style
but
the
overall
effort
backfired
either
that
or
this
bottle
isnt
that
fresh
how
would
i
know
without
any
bottle
date
info
pours
dark
brown
with

hue
and
a

for
a
good
bit
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
malt
coffee
and
yeast
notes
with
a
fair
amount
of
robustness
and
no
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
mediumhigh
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
with
a
moderately
creamy
smooth
and
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
good
could
use
more
body
though
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
doppelbock
style
good
balance
and
complexity
of
coffee
malt
and
yeast
ester
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
for
the
abv
not
as
malty
robust
as
i
was
hoping
for
but
still
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
mouthfeel
is
interesting
very
high
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
leaves
this
very
drinkable
yet
not
too
thin
perfect
for
fall
o
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
but
having
tried
it
twice
now
i
guess
it
is
just
not
the
beer
for
me
i
really
get
the
taste
of
coffee
that
has
been
left
on
the
burner
for
way
too
long
and
not
great
coffee
at
that
the
mouthfeel
is
really
light
for
the
doppelbock
style
and
other
comparable
beers
almost
like
iced
coffee
was
poured
into
the
beer
o
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
especially
at
its
price
point
overall
worth
trying
but
isnt
a
goto
for
me
again
the
coffee
is
a
nice
touch
but
it
could
have
been
done
better
i
feel
overall
would
like
to
try
at
the
brewery
to
see
if
its
better
fresh
im
hoping
this
is
simply
the
byproduct
of
a
poorly
stored
bottle
very
interesting
beer
all
around
and
really
quite
far
from
what
i
was
expecting
i
wanted
a
malty
sweet
doppelbock
with
a
nice
light
coffee
addition
it
tastes
more
like
straight
up
burnt
coffee
beans
with
almost
no
mention
of
doppelbock
in
the
flavor
or
the
aroma
its
not
bad
but
its
not
something
i
would
regularly
reach
for
dark
horse
should
stick
to
ales
overall
a
well
crafted
lager
smooth
and
rich
o
i
do
recommend
this
beer
mostly
to
coffee
drinkers
i
think
the
appearance
is
very
dopplebockish
but
the
flavor
is
mostly
just
coffee
if
a
person
is
looking
for
a
good
dopplebock
to
drink
i
would
recommend
they
look
elsewhere
this
is
a
very
good
coffee
flavored
beer
overall
the
coffee
leads
this
beer
and
the
dopplebock
takes
a
back
set
not
that
this
is
bad
the
thing
i
love
about
this
beer
is
that
it
reminds
me
of
drinking
an
iced
irish
coffee
it
is
a
coffee
dopplebock
as
stated
on
the
label
so
obviously
coffee
is
the
driving
force
behind
the
flavor
but
as
i
said
before
you
can
slightly
taste
alcohol
then
you
add
some
vanilla
cream
and
sugar
and
there
you
have
it
o
pretty
solid
as
a
coffee
beer
but
somewhat
lacking
as
a
double
bock
but
what
would
you
expect
with
the
addition
of
coffee
still
an
enjoyable
beer
nice
light
fizzy
texture
crisp
good
coffeee
taste
and
aroma
missing
actual
beer
tastes
though
but
its
quite
a
nice
drinking
beverage
overall
eh
its
good
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
an
iced
coffee
made
with
somewhat
stale
tasting
coffee
the
sweetness
and
malts
are
great
but
they
take
a
definite
backseat
to
the
coffee
follows
the
trajectory
of
most
dark
hose
beer
ive
encountered
its
solid
but
not
great
drinkable
with
enough
flavor
to
remain
interesting
a
good
use
of
coffee
coupled
with
a
rich
sweet
malt
base
a
little
unbalanced
in
the
end
and
that
hurts
in
this
case
but
its
par
for
dark
horse
o
i
liked
this
one
better
than
most
cool
beer
there
is
a
reason
certain
beers
are
brewed
under
the
reinheitsgebot
the
doppelbock
is
by
far
my
favorite
beer
style
so
i
was
naturally
skeptical
that
a
brewery
would
seek
to
alter
such
a
strong
and
already
flavorful
style
my
skepticism
was
well
founded
i
picked
up
a
four
pack
of
this
brew
in
hopes
that
it
would
be
a
nice
marriage
of
dark
beer
styles
sadly
it
was
not
the
coffee
grounds
did
not
mesh
well
with
the
strong
flavors
of
the
doppelbock
style
the
nose
smells
of
rich
malt
but
then
diminishes
with
the
coffee
smells
the
taste
also
exhibits
a
conflicted
character
with
the
strong
maltiness
and
caramel
notes
competing
with
the
coffee
notes
this
one
is
a
unique
experience
but
not
one
id
seek
out
again
pours
a
darker
brown
with
a
small
head
at
pour
which
disappates
to
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
unfiltered
look
very
almost
too
much
no
real
lacing
present
aroma
is
sweet
malts
brown
sugar
with
a
strong
backbone
of
coffee
taste
is
great
coffee
is
a
bit
more
forward
deeper
roast
along
with
a
good
dose
of
malt
flavoring
heavier
great
combintation
overall
solid
beer
a
nice
spin
on
the
dopplebock
but
it
doesnt
taste
anything
like
a
dopplebock
in
all
honesty
very
nice
solid
beer
for
the
price
but
the
lack
of
thickness
is
a
huge
turnoff
coffee
dopplebock
what
this
is
certainly
a
strange
pairing
but
somehow
these
people
have
made
it
work
well
its
malty
but
not
robust
its
got
the
coffee
kick
of
bittersweetness
and
it
actually
compliments
the
dopple
style
brew
it
smells
malty
and
a
little
of
coffee
it
tastes
really
good
the
bottle
i
have
does
not
look
like
this
picture
but
has
a
big
goat
headed
man
on
it
and
looks
like
it
came
from
a
metal
video
i
think
this
packaging
better
reflects
what
this
beer
is
truly
about
as
it
is
a
pretty
unholy
union
of
flavor
to
create
something
compelling
and
interesting
and
new
this
is
a
high
alcohol
brew
with
an
easy
drinkability
you
should
try
it
out
its
not
for
everyone
but
it
sure
is
interesting
o
all
coffee
no
doppelbock
this
was
a
disappointment
a
very
dirty
and
haphazard
beer
and
it
completely
lacks
depth
i
am
very
surprised
by
this
one
it
is
obviously
coffee
grounds
in
your
face
holes
its
a
great
twist
on
a
dopplebock
and
a
solid
one
at
that
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
one
sitting
it
really
feels
like
the
perfect
marriage
of
the
two
main
flavors
i
like
it
i
cannot
say
i
have
had
a
beer
quite
like
this
before
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
dark
horse
did
a
nice
job
seemingly
combining
the
roasted
oats
and
coffee
of
a
more
robust
stout
with
the
nuttiness
of
a
brown
ale
im
not
sure
it
is
really
a
doppelbock
but
i
think
the
accomplished
their
mission
odthis
beer
is
flat
out
awesome
one
of
the
best
imitations
of
coffee
i
have
found
in
a
beer
take
away
the
bubbles
and
it
could
be
confused
for
coffee
underrated
beer
for
sure
a
tasty
stoutish
coffee
brew
good
robust
flavor
and
goes
down
easy
a
bit
odd
for
a
bock
maybe
but
worth
trying
and
pretty
easy
to
like
im
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
it
is
definitely
what
it
promises
to
be
a
doppelbock
with
coffee
the
problem
for
me
is
that
this
beer
is
dominated
by
coffee
which
almost
completely
covers
up
what
could
have
been
a
solid
standalone
doppelbock
its
not
that
the
coffee
is
bad
but
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
balance
allowing
each
flavor
to
come
through
this
was
nice
to
have
once
but
the
next
time
im
in
the
mood
for
a
doppelbock
ill
probably
go
for
a
classic
overall
a
good
brew
with
complex
flavors
and
well
balanced
id
drink
it
again
o
this
is
the
best
coffee
tasting
beer
aside
from
the
more
traditional
stouts
and
porters
i
have
had
it
has
a
big
coffee
aroma
and
taste
this
is
a
great
coffee
beer
to
drink
if
you
are
not
in
the
mood
for
the
fullness
of
a
coffee
stout
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
im
extremely
impressed
with
the
head
and
warming
effect
it
has
i
will
definitely
be
recommending
this
to
my
pals
4
5
i
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
of
a
mindblowing
experience
from
this
one
since
i
hear
great
things
about
this
brewery
and
to
be
honest
the
label
artwork
was
so
bad
ass
i
wasnt
all
that
impressed
though
it
is
a
nice
tasty
dessert
beer
i
believe
i
paid
5
plus
the
shipping
cost
to
get
this
in
nj
which
i
would
say
not
worth
it
to
do
again
but
i
am
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
o
an
average
brew
not
bad
but
nothing
really
stood
out
about
the
beer
not
being
a
devotee
of
the
style
i
tried
to
score
it
a
little
higher
than
my
initial
impressions
would
have
dictated
my
bias
i
think
i
am
partial
to
the
notion
that
coffee
flavors
in
beer
are
best
suited
to
porters
and
stouts
this
was
not
a
beer
id
return
to
but
i
would
not
discourage
someone
else
from
trying
it
o
almost
like
peche
mortels
younger
brother
a
solid
coffee
infused
beer
that
does
one
thing
and
does
it
well
o
this
is
a
tasty
brew
particuarly
if
you
like
the
use
of
coffee
in
your
beer
the
sweet
malt
backbone
balances
out
the
bitterness
of
the
coffe
rines
very
nice
oimpressed
by
the
balanced
of
the
coffee
wasnt
that
overpowering
maybe
some
more
of
the
doppelbock
could
have
come
out
but
all
in
all
it
was
tasty
o
a
good
dopplebock
a
really
good
dopplebock
this
one
has
a
lot
of
flavors
mixed
up
together
and
they
really
do
go
well
this
is
a
good
one
and
im
glad
i
have
another
bottle
o
a
very
interesting
and
unique
brew
most
dopples
are
malt
bombs
but
this
turns
them
on
their
head
with
the
addition
of
the
coffee
i
love
thier
interpretation
and
willingness
to
up
the
ante
on
the
style
big
fan
of
dark
horse
and
this
does
nothing
to
change
my
opinion
o
this
has
a
coffee
character
much
unlike
most
dark
coffee
beers
its
light
its
aromatic
and
its
much
more
like
coffee
and
cream
than
freshground
java
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
is
in
the
morning
or
after
dinner
though
i
think
ill
keep
the
prenoon
drinking
to
a
minimumat
least
until
the
weekend
o
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
brew
nothing
really
spectacular
going
on
but
worth
a
try
if
you
like
coffee
beer
it
features
mild
coffee
with
overall
mild
flavors
capped
off
with
an
alcohol
bite
this
one
would
be
a
good
substitute
for
coffee
on
a
late
fall
morning
in
the
woods
of
maine
very
light
on
all
the
flavors
and
the
alcohol
is
way
too
prevelant
very
nicely
done
after
note
some
dark
coffee
powder
like
thing
settled
down
at
the
end
of
glass
o
an
impressive
and
enjoyable
beer
i
like
how
the
bready
toasty
dopplebock
notes
work
in
harmony
with
the
coffee
ive
passed
over
this
many
times
its
now
on
my
radar
definitely
worth
a
shot
although
perkulator
is
inspired
by
traditional
dopplebocks
i
would
prefer
more
adherence
to
the
malt
richness
rather
than
caramel
sweet
taste
the
base
beer
favors
the
sweet
tooth
rather
than
the
savory
fullness
and
bready
textures
as
the
coffee
registers
with
the
taste
buds
they
seem
a
bit
strained
and
lacking
the
freshness
or
silkiness
of
the
classy
coffee
shop
this
version
is
a
satisfying
beer
but
becomes
a
bit
ambiguous
this
beer
is
hazy
amber
brown
with
very
little
of
an
off
white
head
the
nose
is
slightly
roasty
and
rather
bland
the
beer
starts
out
with
a
smooth
feel
with
toffee
and
caramelized
dark
fruits
it
follows
up
with
some
roasted
notes
the
last
taste
of
the
beer
is
all
coffee
strong
roasty
and
dry
coffee
flavors
stick
on
the
palate
the
beer
sounds
like
an
unusual
blend
but
somehow
works
and
doesnt
really
taste
as
strange
as
you
may
expect
this
is
a
well
done
and
unique
brew
definitely
worth
checking
out
o
not
really
complex
but
its
good
at
what
it
does
went
for
unfortunately
the
coffee
drowns
out
any
flavors
the
doppelbock
base
would
have
provided
12
for
a
4pack
at
super
liquor
iv
in
ann
arbor
o
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
dopplebock
wish
it
didnt
have
that
faint
offputting
aftertaste
though
very
unfortunate
o
interesting
and
definitely
drinkable
my
criticisms
for
this
one
all
revolve
around
the
doppelbock
aspects
being
somewhat
obscured
by
the
loudness
of
the
coffee
aspects
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
doppelbock
backbone
supporting
the
coffee
rather
than
getting
smothered
by
it
a
coffee
doppelbock
is
a
great
idea
but
in
this
brew
it
feels
as
though
the
two
ideas
are
fighting
each
other
rather
than
working
cooperatively
and
for
better
or
for
worse
the
coffee
faction
is
winning
quite
decisively
overall
very
happy
with
this
years
brew
it
has
been
hit
or
miss
in
the
past
but
glad
2012
was
a
o
k
solid
beer
but
ultimately
forgettable
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
but
there
are
better
coffeeflavored
alternatives
out
there
o
a
solid
beer
overall
if
a
bit
simple
the
coffee
unfortunately
overwhelms
the
doppelbock
aspects
but
its
still
enjoyable
dark
horse
certainly
wasnt
lying
when
they
labeled
this
beer
as
coffee
doppelbock
did
this
beer
have
too
much
coffee
no
i
think
it
had
the
right
amount
of
coffee
in
it
it
was
just
the
quality
of
the
coffee
they
put
in
this
beer
the
coffee
was
far
too
dry
as
is
its
not
a
bad
doppelbock
if
youre
ever
in
the
mood
for
a
dry
beer
with
a
strong
taste
of
coffee
in
it
then
pick
up
a
bottle
of
perkulator
i
love
coffee
almost
as
much
as
beer
and
this
is
good
example
however
the
wet
coffee
ground
aroma
detracts
the
flavors
really
come
together
as
it
gets
warmer
poured
this
at
a
good
temperaturre
with
a
medium
size
light
tan
foamy
head
that
soon
settles
and
no
lace
color
is
a
clear
mahoganey
with
a
plenty
of
bubble
trails
aroma
is
malt
coffee
molasses
roast
dark
ripe
fruit
flavors
like
nose
not
overly
sweet
slight
bitterness
and
enough
carbonic
tang
to
balance
body
and
carbonation
are
good
finish
is
like
flavor
fairly
long
and
a
liittle
boozy
not
entirely
convinced
that
coffee
can
be
used
in
almost
anything
for
what
this
is
it
isnt
too
bad
as
it
does
seem
to
successfully
find
that
middle
ground
between
coffee
beer
and
doppelbock
the
coffee
definitely
makes
an
impression
in
this
though
this
one
is
interesting
id
be
willing
to
have
it
again
o
this
beer
starts
out
nicely
but
the
earthy
dirtlike
flavor
stemming
from
the
coffee
is
bothersome
the
idea
of
a
coffee
doppelbock
is
awesome
but
either
this
is
too
old
or
the
idea
wasnt
executed
to
the
best
possible
way
notes
drank
on
3282012
i
can
dig
this
beer
wish
the
coffee
flavor
were
a
bit
more
pronounced
and
perhaps
not
as
cooked
but
it
did
its
job
and
did
not
distract
from
the
rest
of
the
beer
most
certainly
going
to
come
back
to
this
beer
again
overall
a
good
idea
that
just
doesnt
work
in
this
concoction
add
that
into
the
fact
that
it
seems
like
this
is
a
weak
doppel
on
its
own
reduces
the
enjoyment
factor
even
more
good
idea

however
this
rawness
certainly
intrigues
me
a
curious
beer
but
i
wouldnt
actively
seek
this
out
again
it
takes
a
bit
of
time
to
really
find
the
doppelbock
in
the
espresso
but
very
flavorful
nonetheless
very
bitter
result
of
all
this
initial
coffee
taste
with
a
bourbon
like
secondary
coffee
dominates
its
coffee
aroma
and
a
pure
coffee
taste
copper
brown
and
a
nice
head
above
average
mouthfeel
hard
to
finish
this
one
an
idea
maybe
not
the
best
executed
o
probably
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
i
dont
get
coffee
and
i
dont
get
doppelbock
probably
dumping
this
one
after
about
4
sips
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
coffee
with
an
almost
sweet
toffee
or
caramel
hint
a
solid
dopplebock
and
one
well
worthy
of
purchase
overall
4
unique
beer
im
not
getting
the
doppelbock
at
all
tastes
more
like
a
coffee
lager
or
something
probably
wont
buy
again
but
its
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
yet
o
a
little
all
over
the
place
but
still
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
thanks
andy
for
the
awesome
trade
o
not
good
coffee
is
too
much
of
an
after
thought
stringency
is
confusing
as
well
no
good
overall
is
pretty
good
im
enjoying
it
but
have
found
that
the
intensity
of
flavor
is
light
and
the
abv
is
not
really
apparent
it
drinks
like
a
smaller
beer
o
i
just
tried
the
2011
and
not
much
has
changed
from
2010
i
think
aging
this
one
only
made
it
worse
omajor
letdown
from
these
guys
ive
had
some
pretty
good
offerings
from
them
but
this
one
really
let
me
down
in
a
major
way
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
too
overall
if
you
really
like
lightly
sweetened
black
coffee
then
you
will
likely
enjoy
this
i
would
have
liked
this
more
if
this
were
thicker
and
had
a
more
substantial
mouthfeel
im
pretty
green
when
it
comes
to
this
style
but
it
seems
this
should
have
been
a
bit
more
full
and
substantial
try
it
if
you
can
make
ur
own
6pak
o
pours
a
dark
murky
brown
with
a
tightly
carbonated
white
but
rapidly
dissipating
head
sediment
is
settling
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
right
away
smell
is
pretty
subtle
not
very
strong
at
all
smells
like
an
old
coffee
filter
coffee
taste
is
very
prominent
in
the
first
few
drinks
accompanied
by
a
strong
bittercoffee
finish
that
hangs
around
a
bit
working
through
the
glass
the
coffee
becomes
less
prominentnoticeable
and
tastes
like
a
semisweet
roast
smooth
mouthfeel
with
some
dryness
this
is
an
interesting
beer
aside
from
the
nose
which
i
dont
care
for
it
has
a
decent
flavor
profile
and
drinks
pretty
easily
in
small
doses
pours
a
mahogany
hue
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
quickly
disappears
with
no
lacing
or
retention
but
does
have
moderate
carbonation
the
aroma
is
strong
with
roasted
coffee
with
hints
of
caramel
and
molasses
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
roasted
coffee
taste
that
sticks
til
the
finish
there
is
also
some
caramel
molasses
sweet
malts
and
hint
of
bitter
chocolate
in
the
back
the
coffee
taste
remains
in
the
aftertaste
overall
this
soft
sticky
mouthfeel
beer
seems
to
be
a
rather
nice
beer
for
coffee
lovers
but
just
not
my
kind
of
beer
poured
mahogany
with
a
halffinger
of
foam
that
dissipated
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
smell
is
coffee
light
roasted
caramelly
malts
taste
is
similar
good
medium
coffee
light
bitterness
caramel
and
roasted
malt
some
biscuit
and
light
sweetness
coffee
flavor
carries
through
from
smell
to
taste
and
finish
medium
body
light
carbonation
hits
the
right
notes
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
coffeeforward
beer
oa
pretty
nice
beer
only
complaint
is
a
little
heavy
on
the
coffee
bitter
astringent
bite
if
you
like
coffee
this
is
your
beer
a
fellow
drinker
noted
that
this
is
the
first
coffee
beer
he
has
had
that
actually
tastes
like
coffee
overall
great
example
of
a
coffee
beer
the
beer
is
dark
copper
to
ruby
hued
with
a
quarter
inch
of
light
tan
head
that
leaves
random
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
offers
coffee
chocolate
malt
nice
smelling
beer
the
flavor
brings
milk
chocolate
lager
malt
really
nice
lots
of
chocolate
milk
flavors
pretty
straightforward
decent
beer
i
would
have
this
again
d
a
very
interesting
and
well
executed
offering
from
the
fine
folks
at
dark
horse
quite
unique
and
slightly
different
from
almost
anything
else
that
ive
experienced
a
must
try
for
true
beer
lovers
and
something
that
ill
gladly
invest
in
another
40pack
in
the
future
o
the
beer
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
but
the
coffee
taste
somewhat
resembles
convenience
store
coffee
that
has
been
lingering
for
several
hours
overall
my
biggest
fear
when
drinking
coffee
beers
is
that
it
will
feel
like
i
am
drinking
a
coffee
with
alcohol
instead
of
tasting
some
beer
i
am
very
pleased
to
say
that
dark
horse
does
it
right
here
the
coffee
accentuates
the
beer
and
gives
the
dopplebock
style
a
different
flair
the
dopplebock
side
is
very
solid
the
coffee
is
far
from
overpowering
and
it
really
works
well
here
this
shoots
up
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
the
brewery
because
of
that
kudos
to
dark
horse
to
a
job
well
done
i
will
be
picking
more
of
this
up
very
good
doppelbock
this
one
is
very
well
balanced
not
too
sweet
very
drinkable
and
the
coffee
adds
a
nice
layer
of
complexity
i
enjoy
a
good
cup
of
coffee
and
a
good
brew
so
i
thought
id
give
this
a
try
this
brew
poured
smooth
and
had
an
excellent
appearance
i
really
liked
the
smell
but
the
taste
was
simply
too
much
coffee
for
me
the
coffee
taste
overpowered
the
dopplebock
its
very
unique
this
was
like
drinking
cold
coffee
infused
with
beer
i
dont
know
if
this
has
any
caffeine
in
it
or
not
if
youre
a
coffee
lover
give
it
a
try
chewy
chocolate
malt
base
caramel
sweetness
with
intense
flavors
of
roasted
coffee
perhaps
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
heavy
malt
flavors
with
moderate
carbonation
dark
murky
brown
in
color
light
head
with
a
small
amount
of
lace
get
mostly
coffee
in
the
nose
gets
a
bit
sweet
caramel
malt
aroma
at
the
end
taste
is
like
the
nose
coffee
taste
up
front
turns
sweet
very
quickly
very
sweet
malts
take
over
a
little
bitter
at
the
end
but
fairly
nice
a
little
burnt
taste
too
thinner
drink
in
the
mouth
not
bad
drink
i
didnt
have
super
high
expectations
prior
to
drinking
this
beer
it
poured
a
murkey
almost
but
not
quite
opaque
brown
with
very
little
head
or
carbonation
visible
smell
was
minerally
biscuity
and
just
a
trace
of
coffee
taste
was
predominately
coffee
with
some
cocoa
in
the
background
tasted
like
an
iced
mocha
carbonation
lightened
it
up
a
little
bit
overall
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
i
did
drink
the
whole
thing
if
thats
sayin
anything
d
very
drinkable
and
unique
excellent
not
bad
but
not
sure
if
i
like
it
well
made
decent
balance
and
delivers
as
promised
thats
about
it
overall
i
liked
this
beer
enough
but
i
have
enjoyed
several
other
coffee
beers
more
i
think
this
flavor
needs
to
be
backed
up
by
a
much
bigger
maltier
beer
not
bigger
in
alcohol
more
so
in
body
and
overall
flavor
the
coffee
porters
and
stouts
ive
enjoyed
have
handled
the
coffee
much
better
im
actually
curious
how
they
added
the
coffee
whether
it
was
flavoring
beans
grounds
or
straight
brewed
coffee
maybe
changing
the
method
would
work
better
imho
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
finger
of
head
that
has
no
retention
the
nose
is
distinctly
coffeelike
as
is
the
upfront
taste
the
finish
is
lingering
coffee
bitterness
this
is
a
spectacular
idea
the
blending
of
coffee
with
a
bock
beer
previously
i
have
only
experienced
coffee
notes
in
stouts
and
porters
and
most
of
them
have
provided
only
weak
coffee
undertones
this
dopplebock
holds
up
to
the
rich
java
flavor
and
stands
as
a
unique
example
of
the
use
of
coffee
in
beer
very
interesting
dopplebock
if
it
was
darker
and
a
tad
thicker
it
would
seem
more
like
a
dry
stout
with
coffee
overall
bonus
points
for
the
unique
experience
but
ultimately
it
comes
across
as
flavored
coffee
with
some
outofplace
noble
hops
i
guess
there
is
a
reason
most
add
coffee
to
porters
and
stouts
o
very
surprised
some
of
the
great
sweet
notes
that
came
out
of
this
guy
a
little
more
body
would
have
added
some
good
depth
to
help
the
flavors
stick
around
for
a
little
while
longer
pours
a
twofinger
light
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
good
lace
opaque
dark
brown
color
yeast
left
in
bottle
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
roasted
coffee
nose
and
flavor
follows
a
good
almost
sweet
roasted
coffee

from

westborough
ma
o
this
is
a
good
beer
excellent
if
youre
looking
for
or
like
full
coffee
flavors
this
isnt
nearly
a
traditional
doppelbock
for
me
but
an
interesting
twist
if
you
accept
it
o
i
was
good
for
the
style
but
not
super
good
i
liked
it
but
pretty
forgettable
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
brown
with
lots
of
carb
bubbles
rising
toward
a
bubbly
tan
cap
on
top
lots
of
coffee
on
the
nose
would
be
an
understatement
i
think
i
find
hints
of
chocolate
and
caramel
underneath
but
honestly
i
cant
smell
past
the
coffee
if
its
any
consolation
its
a
very
pleasant
coffee
aroma
not
harsh
or
acrid
like
some
have
made
taste
is
coffee
right
up
front
and
in
the
finish
there
is
some
melanoid
and
caramel
flavors
about
midway
through
but
they
are
quickly
displaced
by
java
medium
body
and
carbonation
level
slick
bubbly
mouthfeel
nice
drinking
beer
flavored
coffee
oh
wait
its
the
other
way
around
i
liked
this
one
but
at
times
had
trouble
finding
a
dopplebock
in
my
glass
i
am
going
to
leave
the
other
ones
sit
in
a
warm
place
and
see
what
happens
i
have
no
worry
of
ruining
these
bottles
d
nicely
drinkable
good
winter
beer
will
be
getting
this
again
this
is
nice
lots
of
coffee
but
it
tastes
more
like
scorched
green
chiles
kind
of
a
burnt
over
the
campfire
flavor
thinner
body
than
expected
but
fairly
malty
sharp
and
a
touch
of
the
sour
smokey
nose
old
vegetable
broth
with
chocolate
cherries
nice
golden
brown
color
with
longlasting
lacing
o
good
but
not
great
coffee
was
a
great
conceptual
component
for
this
style
but
a
bit
old
maybe
this
would
be
awesome
on
tap
i
did
love
the
nuttiness
of
the
base
doppelbock
i
would
drink
again
but
probably
not
buy
another

these

with
ph
experimentation
and
adding
something
like
that
to
a
extremely
hight

wort
im
sure
makes
for
something
fun
the
beer
shines
after
a

of

the
coffee
the
quick

of
a
malty

and
the
feel
pays
but
fluffy

is
a

there

tweaked
a

still
cant
complain
innovative
brewery
o
a
simple
coffee
beer
definitely
one
to
try
if
you
love
coffee
because
there
isnt
much
more
to
this
one
its
not
like
a
coffee
porter
or
stout
where
there
are
other
aspects
this
literally
tastes
95
like
cold
coffee
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
it
there
was
not
that
much
to
the
smell
and
taste
with
this
i
like
a
coffee
beer
to
really
pack
a
punch
i
could
taste
a
bit
of
fruit
and
coffee
so
it
seems
on
for
the
style
but
just
not
what
i
was
looking
for
o
tasty
and
smooth
a
refreshing
coffee
beer
a
nice
change
from
coffee
porters
and
stouts
probably
great
around
a
campfire
body
is
medium
finish
is
long
but
flavor
is
severely
disappointing
theres
little
joy
in
this
one
and
you
wont
see
me
drinking
another
sorry

that
this
one
is
all
about
the
coffee
taste
roasty
coffee
notes
dark
chocolate
in
the
back
of
the
throat
perfect
balance
between
the
coffee
flavors
and
the
dopplebock
flavors
you
would
expect
awesome
carbonation
here
its
on
the
rich
side
in
terms
of
carbonation
and
it
actually
does
wonders
for
this
beer
in
making
it
a
refreshing
experience
overall
i
really
like
this
one
i
would
seek
out
again
a
good
coffee
beer
is
pretty
valuable
to
me
and
i
dont
get
many
good
ones
locally
randall
o
mouthfeel
aside
this
is
pretty
much
exactly
what
i
would
want
out
of
a
coffee
dopplebock
easy
to
drink
substantive
without
being
overbearing
if
this
had
a
bit
better
head
this
would
be
up
there
with
ngs
uff
da
for
my
favorite
bock
as
it
is
it
is
just
half
a
step
below
truly
recommended
do
enjoyed
overall
but
the
coffee
aspect
took
away
from
the
token
dopplebock
flavors
that
i
wanted
to
find
in
this
dark
horse
offering
would
recommend
to
coffee
beer
lovers
but
not
to
dopplebock
lovers
overall
i
liked
it
but
at
the
same
time
i
was
also
a
bit
indifferent
to
it
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
but
the
overall
impression
left
me
wanting
wanted
a
fuller
meallike
beer
o
didnt
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
can
certainly
taste
the
coffee
flavor
especially
in
the
aftertaste
but
its
that
spicy
cayenne
pepper
flavor
that
dominates
most
of
the
other
flavors
in
this
beer
an
interesting
take
on
the
doppelbock
but
this
version
completely
drowns
out
most
of
the
doppelbock
nature
and
therefore
primarily
fails
in
my
opinion
this
is
more
of
a
coffee
bock
than
a
doppelbock
and
the
coffee
doesnt
even
taste
particularly
good
i
honestly
cannot
say
this
tastes
anything
like
a
dopplebock
let
alone
even
beer
but
i
like
it
simply
a
sweet
coffee
flavored
brew
will
probably
purchase
again
id
love
to
love
this
one
more
but
i
have
to
say
the
sour
in
this
particular
beer
isnt
my
preference
o
this
is
no
doubt
a
good
drink
and
well
crafted
but
its
not
really
to
my
tastes
im
not
into
the
coffee
with
cream
taste
if
you
are
check
this
out
fuller
medium
body
a
bit
creamy
and
pretty
smooth
on
the
palate
definitely
a
pretty
strange
beer
although
it
pretty
much
delivers
what
the
name
implies
pours
out
as
a
brownish
orange
color
without
much
head
the
beer
is
a
bit
lighter
in
color
than
i
expected
the
smell
is
heavy
with
coffee
im
not
really
able
to
pull
much
more
from
this
the
taste
has
a
big
and
bold
coffee
flavor
to
it
there
isnt
much
depth
here
its
like
drinking
a
chilled
black
coffee
to
me
i
wasnt
able
to
get
much
malt
of
hop
flavors
at
all
the
coffee
just
really
over
powers
everything
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
in
medium
and
doesnt
have
much
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
little
disappointing
the
appearance
is
probably
the
best
part
of
this
bottle
nice
reddish
orange
color
with
a
small
head
just
coffee
on
the
nose
coffee
at
first
with
the
taste
then
sweet
the
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
a
cherry
blowpop
unique
flavor
but
not
very
impressed
once
is
enough
for
me
pours
a
thin
brown
with
a
small
head
smell
is
pretty
reserved
coffee
not
much
else
tastes
like
a
cold
coffee
poured
into
a
sam
adams
finishes
with
just
a
hint
of
sourness
as
it
warms
more
coffee
bitterness
and
sweetness
comes
out
its
a
bit
odd
tasting
and
not
particularly
enjoyable
this
is
a
bit
thinner
than
expected
for
a
doppelbock
overall
i
dont
think
this
is
a
very
successful
experiment
it
seems
like
they
toned
down
a
doppelbocks
sweetness
and
body
to
allow
the
coffee
to
come
through
to
neithers
benefit
not
undrinkable
by
any
means
but
not
nearly
my
favorite
i
had
a
more
proper
tasting
of
this
just
recently
on
tap
at
the
trapp
door
in
emmaus
pa
as
above
i
still
recommend
this
beer
for
coffeelovers
and
only
for
coffeelovers
pours
clear
dark
brown
with
a
thin
wispy
head
big
aroma
of
coffee
grounds
and
not
much
else
taste
was
almost
pure
coffee
almost
like
drinking
a
cold
thin
cup
of
the
stuff
there
may
have
been
some
other
subtle
complexities
present
but
the
coffee
pretty
much
overwhelms
everything
if
thats
your
thing
then
great
youll
love
it
but
its
not
really
my
thing
so
i
didnt
love
it
dthis
is
my
firstdoppelbock
to
have
and
i
wasnt
that
impressed
ill
keep
trying
this
style
but
this
beer
just
tasted
alittle
to
watery
for
me
and
also
had
alittle
too
much
of
a
smokey
taste
for
me
felt
alittle
unbalanced
too
while
the
appearance
is
near
perfect
with
excellent
retention
and
lacing
the
flavors
just
were
not
up
to
par
in
my
opinion
i
would
be
very
interested
in
trying
this
beer
on
tap
as
i
believe
the
coffee
flavors
would
really
help
this
beer
if
they
were
fresher
drinkability
interesting
beer
here
bock
flavors
and
tart
fruityness
o
enjoyable
i
am
not
sure
i
would
buy
it
again
but
i
did
enjoy
it
the
appearance
could
be
improved
but
not
if
the
taste
is
lost
a
very
pleasant
beer
at
anytime
in
the
day
just
not
more
than
one
bottle
at
a
time
for
me
m
light
to
medium
body
light
carbonation
glad
i
tried
it
had
been
meaning
to
try
something
from
dark
horse
i
just
wont
try
this
one
again
d
a
good
beer
at
a
good
price
if
you
like
sweet
coffee
go
grab
this
d
certainly
a
unique
beer
coffee
nutty
flavors
and
sweetness
a
nice
combination
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
that
doppelbock
malty
sweetness
this
is
a
beer
i
wanted
to
love
but
its
not
quite
there
for
me
the
flavors
mix
in
odd
ways
and
just
dont
mesh
well
d
its
good
but
not
great
finishes
a
little
warm
gonna
pass
next
time
drinkability
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
definitely
a
sipping
beer
that
youll
want
to
spread
your
bottles
out
over
the
nights
since
i
cant
get
victory
at
sea
here
this
is
my
new
closest
favorite
local
my
second
dark
horse
beer
and
it
didnt
let
me
down

to

finger
tan
head
dissipates
quickly
nose
is
filled
with
dark
fruit
a
bit
of
coffee
and
caramel
the
taste
brings
more
dark
fruit
coffee
caramel
and
adds
some
toasty
nuts
and
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
a
bit
of
vanilla
is
also
noticeable
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
in
this
one
im
a
fan
of
dark
horse
and
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
good
sipper
but
a
tad
too
sweet
to
drink
a
bunch
well
as
a
traditional
dopplebock
this
might
not
fare
so
well
but
as
an
american
interpretation
of
the
style
god
knows
we
americans
love
to
fuck
with
our
beer
i
think
it
tastes
very
good
although
the
coffee
flavor
is
intense
maybe
a
little
much
for
those
who
arent
a
fan
of
coffee
to
begin
with
courtesy
of
seeswo
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
st
tulip
pours
a
semitranslucent
mahogany
with
a
loose
bubbly
half
inch
khakicolored
head
that
loses
half
its
volume
in
a
matter
of
seconds
and
eventually
disperses
into
a
band
around
the
shoulders
no
lacing
on
this
one
nose
expresses
slightly
vegetal
coffee
grounds
a
hint
of
lactose
and
something
sweet
taste
reveals
slightly
vinous
fruit
a
sugary
character
and
coffee
grounds
less
vegetal
than
in
the
nose
however
the
flavor
lingers
between
quaffs
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
lively
almost
prickly
carbonation
theres
also
some
acidity
that
stimulates
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
the
sides
of
the
cheek
an
interesting
interpretation
of
the
style
however
the
coffee
grounds
flavor
gets
to
be
a
little
much
i
think
its
cool
that
dark
horse
came
up
with
a
new
substyle
and
almost
nailed
my
best
expectations
get
rid
of
the
steelyness
and
with
some
tweaks
to
the
body
and
carbonation
this
could
be
great
dabove
average
but
i
would
not
go
back
for
another
this
beer
pours
a
dark
muddy
amber
with
a
one
finger
foamy
beige
head
it
smells
very
strongly
of
coffee
beans
and
sweet
malts
the
doppelbock
definitely
comes
out
in
the
flavor
there
is
little
coffee
and
you
get
a
lot
of
yeast
sweet
malts
bread
and
some
strange
fruit
its
appealing
but
is
kind
of
odd
for
a
doppel
it
drinks
fine
its
both
fresh
and
crisp
with
good
carbonation
despite
my
ranking
i
actually
do
like
this
because
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
traditional
doppelbocks
this
beer
has
good
flavor
and
is
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
isnt
present
at
all
d
good
but
the
taste
seems
a
bit
watered
down
a
bit
too
carbonated
as
well
would
like
to
have
again
d
other
than
the
carbonation
issue
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
mouth
is
very
overcarbonated
good
drinker
though
the
palate
opens
with
a
big
coffee
character
with
some
dark
fruit
character
figs
in
particular
along
with
some
moderately
bready
flavor
mildly
wheatlike
drying
on
the
finish
with
plenty
of
coffee
flavor
with
very
low
coffee
bitterness
or
acidity
emphasizing
the
fruitiness
moderate
caramel
sweetness
is
present
particularly
on
the
midpalate
all
of
this
really
makes
this
taste
like
dulce
de
leche
coffee
medium
in
body
this
is
rather
dry
carbonation
is
moderate
but
the
finish
is
a
little
disappointing
as
it
doesnt
have
much
lingering
flavor
just
some
carbonic
acid
this
is
a
rather
terrible
dopplebock
but
it
is
a
rather
enjoyable
beer
the
purity
of
the
coffee
flavor
makes
me
think
of
fresh
peche
mortel
mouthfeel
is
smoother
tasting
that
some
traditional
doppelbocks
ive
had
lower
carbonation
easy
to
drink
but
overall
drinkability
is
maybe
limited
because
it
only
pairs
well
with
certain
foods
due
to
the
flavors
d
i
may
have
it
again
if
given
the
option
but
i
could
use
more
body
in
my
doppelbock
still
it
was
a
pretty
great
beer
d
drinking
one
at
a
time
would
be
great
but
i
would
probably
not
have
another
one
right
away
the
flavor
is
a
little
on
the
stronger
side
so
one
at
a
time
would
probably
be
better
good
drinkability
with
this
brew
the
first
whiff
of
the
nose
made
me
think
roasted
bitter
coffee
but
it
was
much
more
balanced
that
that
the
creamy
mouthfeel
helps
it
go
down
smooth
definitely
not
a
beer
you
could
have
a
good
amount
of
but
a
couple
at
a
time
certainly
isnt
out
of
the
question
d
solid
offering
makes
a
repeat
purchase
inevitable
seems
just
a
touch
diluted
for
what
i
would
expect
from
the
style
but
very
well
constructed
this
beer
pours
a
murky
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
totally
of
coffee
with
the
slightest
of
malt
the
taste
has
much
of
the
coffee
within
but
there
is
a
slight
malt
background
its
a
really
odd
combination
of
smooth
maltiness
for
a
doppelbock
this
is
pretty
weird
there
is
the
obvious
acidity
note
that
really
clashes
too
much
for
the
mouthfeel
of
a
normal
doppelbock
i
pretty
much
like
this
beer
but
thats
only
because
i
like
coffee
d
like
most
other
doppelbocks
i
have
encountered
it
is
an
easy
drink
at
a
fairly
high
abv
so
be
careful
but
dont
hesitate
to
try
this
one
this
is
way
better
than
i
really
hoped
i
just
thought
it
was
something
trendy
or
some
weird
idea
just
to
be
different
but
i
feel
like
this
was
a
well
thought
out
beer
that
took
multiple
attempts
to
get
it
how
they
wanted
thanks
dark
horse
ill
be
back
d
i
like
the
lightness
of
the
body
combined
with
the
coffee
and
roasted
malt
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
im
looking
forward
to
drinking
it
again
d
overall
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
have
had
coffee
beers
that
have
a
much
smoother
coffee
flavor
but
the
malt
is
able
to
balance
the
coffee
bitterness
in
this
one
d
tasty
beer
but
one
is
enough
d
this
is
a
really
delicious
coffee
brew
i
loved
the
combo
of
a
dopplebock
with
coffee
i
was
stunned
at
the
relatively
low
rating
it
was
delicious
d
very
drinkable
but
not
very
enjoyable
very
tasty
and
good
aromatics
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
ton
of
this
one
they
did
do
a
very
good
job
of
weaving
the
coffee
flavors
and
aromas
into
the
beer
without
totally
overpowering
all
of
the
other
flavors
wow
really
i
swear
i
had
one
of
these
a
few
weeks
back
and
dont
remember
it
tasting
like
this
although
my
bottle
then
was
at
least
a
year
old
i
guess
the
smoke
i
was
thinking
i
was
getting
was
the
roasted
coffee
hmm
well
i
know
im
bad
at
reviewing
so
take
it
for
what
its
worth
ill
gladly
finish
this
glass
im
glad
i
got
to
do
this
one
blind
drinkability
is
not
the
greatest
but
not
bad
a
hint
of
booze
is
starting
to
come
through
as
it
warms
with
some
acidicty
and
some
of
the
sweetness
but
it
has
a
drier
finish
that
helps
and
the
coffee
comes
in
a
good
proportion
not
too
heavy
that
it
overpowers
the
delicate
beer
or
so
light
that
you
cant
even
detect
it
ill
have
to
try
this
one
again
as
it
stands
not
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
i
love
dark
horse
and
love
doppelbocks
and
like
coffee
but
this
missed
the
mark
this
beer
has
potential
to
be
something
special
maybe
if
they
rework
it
a
little
they
can
have
something
unique
the
carbonation
really
brought
this
beer
down
too
fizzy
nonetheless
solid
brew
if
youre
into
bitter
coffee
this
one
is
still
worth
seeking
out
if
it
werent
for
the
aroma
that
i
find
awful
and
intolerable
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
one
again
its
sort
of
out
there
but
its
nice
enough
if
you
can
get
past
the
smell
but
i
cant
really
do
that
db
the
coffee
flavor
is
very
intense
i
would
have
to
say
a
bit
too
much
it
feels
one
dimensional
a
strange
doppelbock
the
sour
bitter
coffee
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
eventually
make
me
tired
of
this
one
d
ehh
just
ok
for
me
this
isnt
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
doppelbock
even
a
coffee
one
the
coffee
takes
away
much
of
the
rich
maltiness
that
i
associate
with
the
style
seems
more
like
dark
horse
is
trying
to
make
a
coffee
bender
competitor
but
cant
quite
match
the
way
the
sophistication
of
the
coffee
in
that
brew
ultimately
id
say
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
misses
the
mark
a
bit
for
me
d
not
at
all
bitter
and
very
little
after
taste
if
it
wasnt
for
the
sweet
taste
this
beer
would
be
a
high
4
for
drinkability
id
drink
it
again
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
one
the
taste
wasnt
bad
but
the
mouthfeel
needs
to
be
thicker
and
it
could
be
a
bit
less
cloying
d
not
sure
about
the
age
of
this
bottle
but
i
enjoyed
it
much
more
out
of
the
tap
the
coffee
just
seems
to
be
a
bit
off
and
sweetness
is
much
more
abound
this
time
around
still
a
really
good
breakfast
beer
overall
dark
horse
did
well
on
this
beer
but
im
not
sure
it
is
for
me
they
accomplished
what
they
set
out
to
do
marry
a
powerful
flavor
to
a
subtle
and
classic
style
mission
accomplished
a
good
beer
for
those
that
like
coffee
infused
beers
coffee
haters
need
not
look
for
this
beer
as
it
is
the
major
player
in
the
beer
finish
is
a
medium
bitter
bright
coffee
character
dark
horse
is
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
but
this
was
a
iserable
failure
one
of
the
few
dark
horse
beers
i
had
not
previously
tried
and
i
am
glad
to
have
picked
this
one
up
i
do
love
coffee
beers
and
this
is
one
of
the
more
interesting
a
few
deductions
were
taken
due
to
style
some
characteristics
just
did
not
fit
very
nice
beer
to
nurse
but
i
think
one
is
all
i
need
the
flavor
is
a
coffee
bomb
with
a
late
caramel
flavor
this
beer
is
super
thin
no
carbonation
creamy
in
the
mouth
bitter
finish
this
is
not
that
much
fun
to
drink
definitely
better
doppelbocks
out
there
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
color
is
a
dirty
hazy
brown
with
a
lift
tan
head
nose
brings
an
interesting
combination
of
coffee
roast
smoke
and
dark
fruits
with
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
taste
is
more
coffee
with
the
other
flavors
coming
in
underneath
good
body
with
a
nice
coffee
bite
another
interesting
concept
and
another
success
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
carb
level
is
right
where
id
like
it
and
within
the
style
guidelines
drinkability
is
average
simply
for
the
stale
coffee
taste
no
alcohol
flavor
or
aroma
can
be
detected
which
is
good
d
this
is
solid
fairly
enjoyable
and
would
not
refuse
it
although
wouldnt
seek
it
out
d
a
coffee
dopplebock
is
a
novel
approach
and
as
beers
that
utilize
my
secondfavorite
brewed
beverage
go
this
is
pretty
great
a
little
onedimensional
but
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
d
interesting
pairing
coffee
with
doppelbock
cant
say
that
its
my
favorite
combo
but
im
not
sure
if
that
is
more
due
to
the
stale
coffee
character
or
if
it
is
the
pairing
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
either
way
the
beer
is
drinkable
but
not
very
well
balanced
very
unique
with
just
the
right
amount
of
coffee
very
nice
overall
an
interesting
idea
making
a
coffee
dopplebock
falls
a
bit
short
a
tad
too
much
sweetness
and
not
enough
coffee
alcohol
is
hidden
nicely
very
drinkable
but
not
earth
shattering
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
intriguing
take
on
the
style
it
just
isnt
the
best
coffee
beer
ive
had
but
it
isnt
the
worst
its
a
good
representation
of
the
style
at
least
d
not
bad
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
these
its
appropriate
for
the
colder
months
overall
an
decent
brew
di
am
really
impressed
by
what
dark
horse
did
here
with
the
coffee
beans
in
this
brew
definitely
not
a
traditional
doppelbock
recipe
but
very
tasty
definitely
doesnt
drink
like

about

httpwww

d
big
thanks
to
buckeyenation
for
the
hookup
coffee
doppelbock
is
theoretically
one
of
the
most
promising
and
delicious
emerging
substyles
and
this
is
perhaps
a
cornerstone
example
d
i
find
the
abv
to
be
very
hidden
and
the
notes
all
expressed
very
well
for
the
intention
and
style
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
easy
going
brew
d
nice
beer
for
autumn
makes
me
wish
i
would
have
brewed
the
style
for
this
season
this
beer
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
a
café
au
lait
sort
of
a
milk
stout
smell
and
consistency
with
a
heap
of
coffee
mixed
in
its
missing
a
lot
of
the
bready
complexity
of
the
professed
dopplebock
style
but
thats
replaced
with
an
acidic
lactic
burn
and
a
sweet
quality
thats
enhanced
by
the
coffee
flavor
sort
of
closer
to
southern
tier
jahva
than
dieu
du
ciel
peche
mortel
in
terms
of
coffee
flavor
a
sweet
candylike
coffee
beer
when
i
expected
something
more
earthy
and
herbally
bitter
despite
the
fact
that
it
hardly
fits
the
style
its
still
highly
recommended
d
it
is
good
but
i
feel
like
the
coffee
is
used
as
a
bit
of
a
cover
up
still
good
tasty
and
fairly
repeatable
i
am
blown
away
by
this
beer
has
a
unique
twist
on
the
style
but
delivers
true
to
a
doppelbock
wr
the
same
time
what
an
experience
and
what
a
beer
i
will
be
getting
more
of
this
one
and
could
put
back
a
sixer
myself
i
think
a
must
try
overall
a
great
doppelbock
andor
coffee
beer
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it
if
you
like
coffee
and
you
like
this
style
you
should
love
this
beer
overall
its
pretty
decent
its
a
very
smooth
and
the
coffee
flavor
does
very
well
in
it
very
easy
to
drink
fairly
light
bodied
and
very
drinkable
this
beer
has
totally
reworked
my
opinion
of
dark
horse
d
i
like
coffee
flavor
but
this
stuff
might
be
a
little
over
the
top
im
gonna
have
a
few
more
and
might
have
to
revisit
this
review
it
cant
be
as
strong
as
speedway
stout
right
right
drinkable
like
a
cuppa
joe
this
pours
a
very
dark
brown
somewhat
copper
when
held
up
to
the
light
with
a
heavy
creamcolored
head
it
has
a
strong
roasted
coffee
aroma
i
didnt
really
get
any
of
the
familiar
bock
scents
just
coffee
the
coffee
was
much
stronger
in
the
nose
than
it
was
on
the
tongue
this
beer
had
a
strong
malty
sweetness
lots
of
caramel
goodness
going
on
here
with
the
coffee
only
coming
through
at
the
end
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
i
liked
it
a
lot
neither
flavor
was
fighting
for
the
spotlight
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
well
balanced
brew
perkulator
was
a
truly
interesting
beer
dark
horse
gets
some
bonus
points
for
trying
something
new
with
such
an
established
style
sigh
well
anyway
this
guy
pours
a
murky
panoply
of
shades
of
brown
topped
by
about
a
halffinger
or
so
of
glowing
offwhite
foam
the
nose
begins
with
a
nostrilstabbing
blast
of
cocoadrenched
coffee
beans
sweeter
than
ive
ever
beheld
such
beans
before
as
this
scent
slowly
fades
some
dark
toffee
burnt
molasses
dark
leafy
greens
and
oak
meld
together
to
form
a
fairly
convincing
malty
backdrop
the
taste
is
pretty
much
summed
up
in
the
smell
though
the
coffee
tapers
out
a
bit
into
the
cocoa
making
its
inclusion
a
bit
less
of
an
imposition
unfortunately
everything
else
is
also
toned
down
slightly
the
body
is
a
stoic
medium
though
it
seems
like
its
gaining
weight
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
feel
overall
an
interesting
brew
but
nothing
i
would
really
jump
for
again
drinkability
definitely
will
be
picking
up
some
more
of
this
in
the
future
really
digging
the
coffee
flavor
on
this
by
far
probably
my
favorite
beer
of
the
ones
ive
had
from
dark
horse
dark
muddy
brown
with
a
thin
beige
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
no
head
retention
or
cap
strong
coffee
aromas
with
hints
of
sweet
roasted
malt
medium
to
full
bodied
feel
very
smooth
with
light
carbonation
the
coffee
flavors
are
dominant
in
the
beginning
and
taper
to
a
roasted
sweet
malt
flavor
just
a
slight
hint
of
alcoholic
strength
at
the
end
as
reminder
that
this
is
a
dopplebock
if
youre
a
coffee
drinker
youll
enjoy
this
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
dark
horse
perkulator
is
a
beer
i
was
not
familiar
with
but
as
i
finishing
dinner
at
city
taphouse
i
thought
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
that
would
pair
well
with
dessert
the
beer
is
very
dark
even
by
doppelbock
standards
and
has
a
light
coffee
aroma
to
go
with
the
strong
smell
of
toasted
bread
browning
butter
and
burning
sugar
the
beer
is
like
a
latte
with
a
roasted
aroma
from
coffee
and
toasted
malt
upfront
with
sweetness
and
body
from
the
caramelized
malt
this
paired
very
well
with
a
rich
chocolate
cake
and
bread
pudding
both
served
with
fresh
strawberries
and
blueberries
update
6042011
it
has
been
almost
a
year
since
i
last
tried
this
beer
i
recently
picked
up
another
single
and
thought
it
was
just
as
good
as
the
first
time
i
had
it
i
did
notice
that
this
batch
had
some
spiciness
to
it
that
i
didnt
get
in
the
last
one
the
nose
had
a
frank
red
hot
sauce
like
spiciness
to
it
that
was
different
but
enjoyable
the
spiciness
carried
on
to
the
taste
but
was
much
more
subdued
and
didnt
over
power
the
coffee
it
actually
went
well
with
the
coffee
flavors
i
also
noticed
this
batch
had
better
carbonation
and
head
retention
its
nice
to
have
a
coffee
flavored
beer
every
once
in
a
while
that
isnt
a
porter
or
a
stout
this
one
also
had
a
really
kick
ass
label
that
the
other
one
didnt
its
got
an
awesome
evil
death
metal
vibe
to
it
that
suits
this
beer
i
like
how
dark
horse
gets
different
artists
to
do
different
versions
of
their
labels
it
shows
how
free
thinking
and
open
minded
dark
horse
really
is
i
recommend
it
overall
a
good
but
coffee
beer
that
meets
the
coffee
objective
but
not
much
else
not
sure
if
this
is
normal
or
if
i
have
an
aged
bottle
so
more
mellow
since
they
didnt
put
a
freakin
date
on
it
mild
recommend
if
you
can
easily
get
and
want
to
try
something
from
the
brewery
not
avail
in
tx
so
shipped
back
during
my
in
trip
rotation
one
is
enough
unless
i
could
get
a
known
to
be
fresh
one
just
to
make
sure
nn
dpretty
tasty
a
lot
of
coffee
up
front
the
flavor
ups
from
the
aroma
as
the
taste
is
not
burnt
at
all
hints
of
balance
and
complexity
with
the
malt
sweetness
in
the
back
decent
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
for
the
style
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
its
pretty
close
to
actual
coffee
with
a
little
malt
sweetness
if
you
like
coffee
you
will
probably
like
this
beer
personally
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
beer
flavors
to
it
since
i
typically
love
the
doppelbock
flavor
profile
d
this
was
a
very
interesting
take
at
a
hybrid
style
dopplebocks
are
sweet
which
there
was
some
cream
and
caramel
sweetness
but
the
coffee
part
was
really
nice
fresh
roaste
coffee
all
around
worth
the
try
if
you
like
coffee
i
dont
know
how
often
this
has
been
done
before
but
it
should
be
done
more
obviously
you
have
to
enjoy
coffee
for
this
one
not
that
it
overpowers
in
any
way
but
its
there
from
start
to
finish
rich
aroma
is
like
fine
roast
coffee
with
just
a
hint
of
powdery
unsweet
chocolate
it
pours
a
clear
cola
brown
with
a
finebubbled
pale
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
mouthfilling
flavor
is
mainly
of
quality
coffee
with
an
undertone
of
chocolate
and
hints
of
malt
caramel
and
nuts
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
has
a
good
tingle
to
it
a
bock
tastes
more
like
a
porter
or
stout
than
a
bock
to
me
but
whatever
they
call
it
i
call
it
delicious
this
is
very
solid
one
id
like
to
try
again
d
if
you
like
coffee
youll
like
this
one
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
and
id
drink
it
again
but
wouldnt
go
crazy
trying
to
find
it
this
is
not
a
doppelbock
call
it
something
else
javabock
konabock
i
dont
care
im
all
for
creativity
and
trying
new
things
but
uhuh
fts
d
a
little
sweet
but
not
to
sweet
to
keep
me
from
enjoying
a
few
this
drank
very
easily
i
wouldnt
mind
tracking
a
few
more
down
this
beer
starts
out
as
being
a
coffee
lovers
dream
strong
notes
of
dark
chocolate
and
espresso
with
a
crisp
creamy
after
taste
i
was
amazed
after
half
a
bottle
heres
the
backlash
this
beer
becomes
incredibly
boring
after
a
little
bit
i
honestly
felt
sick
after
my
second
bottle
and
was
completely
turned
off
on
dark
horse
for
a
while
perhaps
it
was
a
bad
batch
because
it
was
only
5
99
a
4
pack
at
whole
foods
but
i
really
disliked
this
beer
d
its
pretty
easy
drinking
for
a
different
sort
of
doppelbock
while
its
a
decent
effort
for
dh
brewing
a
coffee
doppelbock
and
im
fond
of
coffee
stouts
porters
i
think
i
still
prefer
a
more
traditional
beer
of
this
style
i
think
its
very
much
worth
a
try
this
is
very
complex
and
beyond
drinkable
beer
and
coffee
a
great
combination
to
put
the
roast
bean
in
this
style
of
beer
even
better
combo
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
interesting
pour
leaving
a
nice
layer
of
yeast
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
very
little
head
the
aroma
is
certainly
unique
coffee
flavored
raisins
comes
to
mind
more
specifically
raisinettes
im
curious
if
anyone
else
has
noted
this
specific
aroma
before
allowing
time
for
warming
pause
taste
is
coffee
go
figure
raisins
and
chocolate
interesting
interesting
interesting
very
easy
to
drink
considering
the
abv
and
extremely
unique
experience
props
d
jury
is
out
i
didnt
not
like
this
but
at
the
same
time
it
wasnt
great
either
it
went
down
easy
but
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
however
it
would
make
a
nice
breakfast
beer
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
nothing
id
drink
all
the
time
a
good
change
of
pace
perkulator
coffee
dopplebock
may
not
be
dark
horses
best
but
its
an
offering
that
most
craft
beer
lovers
should
enjoy
great
balance
and
good
drinkability
goes
a
long
way
im
glad
that
i
splurged
and
bought
a
sixer
the
body
is
a
little
light
for
this
style
but
this
is
still
a
very
enjoyable
brew
i
think
i
will
enjoy
another
after
entering
this
review
flavor
is
good
but
not
great
not
the
best
dopplebocks
out
there
mouthfeel
and
taste
fall
a
little
short
due
to
a
lighter
than
normal
feel
for
style
and
flavor
isnt
as
sweet
and
strong
as
expected
with
that
said
its
still
very
good
has
a
smooth
feel
and
a
good
amount
of
yeast
and
coffee
flavors
carbonation
is
mild
to
high
fits
the
style
the
coffee
isnt
as
strong
as
some
say
but
there
nonetheless
a
very
good
beer
from
dark
horse
d
pretty
good
i
might
order
another
and
i
might
buy
again
but
not
a
six
pack
a
really
good
beer
here
for
dark
horse
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
is
really
onedimensional
in
my
eyes
pours
a
dark
brown
with
some
woody
highlights
smallish
rapidly
fading
head
smell
is
straight
espresso
and
coffee
grinds
taste
follows
suit
basically
straight
espresso
its
cool
considering
what
it
is
but
its
a
little
offputting
considering
that
its
also
a
beer
if
that
makes
sense
i
just
want
a
little
complexity
in
this
one
nice
smooth
and
pillowy
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
if
youre
looking
for
a
nice
coffee
beer
this
is
your
guy
d
its
a
good
tasting
brew
you
could
almost
substitute
a
meal
with
it
as
it
feels
so
thick
or
heavy
d
a
interesting
take
on
a
beer
i
think
dark
horse
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
with
this
one
a
good
beer
for
the
coffee
drinker
to
try
out
na
zdravje
pours
an
amber
color
that
is
for
the
most
part
clear
but
boasts
a
certain
hue
of
color
that
is
somewhere
inbetween
redish
and
brown
continuous
amount
of
bubbles
rise
to
the
surface
providing
support
for
an
offwhite
colored
head
initially
poured
more
than
a
finger
thick
of
big
white
bubbles
that
receeded
back
to
a
thin
layer
covering
the
beer
aroma
of
this
beer
has
a
mix
of
roasty
coffee
and
maltalcohol
that
almost
comes
across
as
being
musty
taste
of
this
beer
is
well
a
doppelbock
i
know
it
sounds
unoriginal
and
uninspiring
but
that
is
it
nothing
immediately
strikes
outside
of
the
norm
other
than
a
noticable
amount
of
alcohol
warmth
and
an
aftertaste
that
includes
a
bit
of
the
coffee
and
just
a
slight
bit
of
the
roasted
coffee
that
is
reminding
me
of
something
musty
comes
through
in
the
finish
of
the
taste
as
well
the
coffee
is
a
nice
little
addition
to
this
beer
not
an
out
of
control
and
a
dominating
amount
but
just
subtle
enough
to
throw
a
mix
into
the
style
it
has
a
nice
amount
of
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
to
light
feel
is
a
little
light
due
to
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
so
not
a
perfect
beer
not
the
best
beer
but
excellenct
taste
excellent
smell
nice
feel
if
you
like
good
uncommon
coffee
stouts
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
not
a
beer
i
have
to
have
at
all
times
but
definitally
something
ill
pick
up
again
you
get
exactly
what
you
should
expect
from
this
beer
the
name
says
it
all
really
nice
beer
here
di
think
this
brew
can
pretty
much
hold
its
own
but
i
feel
like
its
lacking
something
propes
for
creativity
with
coffee
in
a
dopplebock
though
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
solid
burnt
toffee
scent
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
and
coffee
aroma
its
dry
with
some
underlying
caramel
sweetness
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
i
has
a
dry
coffee
flavor
as
well
as
sweet
caramel
feel
but
there
seems
to
be
something
wrong
here
the
flavors
dont
mix
well
the
coffee
and
roasted
flavors
are
incredibly
dry
almost
musty
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
i
like
the
concept
here
but
the
end
result
is
flawed
d
im
a
big
coffee
fan
so
i
find
this
one
very
drinkable
alcohol
is
basically
nonexistent
making
this
a
very
smooth
drinking
beer
d
an
above
average
coffee
beer
im
not
sure
if
im
sold
on
a
coffee
dopplebock
yet
i
like
my
dopples
without
a
roasted
coffee
component
and
prefer
them
as
a
malt
bomb
it
was
interesting
nontheless
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
getting
a
whole
4pack
d
i
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
as
coffee
is
not
usually
something
you
see
in
a
doppelbock
it
worked
out
fairly
nicely
though
and
id
try
this
again
some
booze
comes
through
in
the
nose
as
it
warms
and
it
becomes
a
bit
cloying
after
a
while
this
was
a
bit
out
of
my
comfort
zone
style
wise
but
i
did
enjoy
it
dont
get
this
if
your
looking
for
a
strong
coffee
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
tint
thin
cream
colored
head
that
fades
quickly
smell
is
of
coffee
and
malts
but
really
just
coffee
the
taste
is
very
interesting
in
that
it
is
very
muted
upfront
just
some
light
malt
but
then
whoa
here
comes
the
coffee
much
like
the
nose
except
it
is
at
the
back
instead
of
the
front
though
i
do
love
coffee
beers
this
one
feels
a
bit
too
one
dimensional
for
me
drinkability
is
fairly
high
this
is
pretty
good
overall
even
though
its
somewhat
onedimensional
a
very
interesting
beer
one
of
the
better
if
not
the
best
coffee
infused
beer
ive
had
d
after
two
i
was
done
too
much
coffee
flavor
overall
the
beer
is
just
to
disjointed
for
me
all
coffee
and
no
malt
to
balance
it
out
not
what
i
was
looking
for
in
a
dopplebock
overall
this
just
wasnt
my
type
of
beer
it
just
doesnt
compete
with
a
lot
of
the
other
coffee
beers
i
have
had
i
also
enjoy
doppelbocks
and
it
wrecked
that
part
of
the
beer
as
well
so
this
beer
is
two
styles
that
i
normally
enjoy
but
not
when
combined
overall
this
is
definitely
a
great
beer
and
one
that
i
would
drink
again
in
a
heartbeat
a
bit
more
body
could
put
this
over
the
hump
from
very
good
to
outstanding
d
this
is
quite
good
out
of
the
ordinary
and
thats
what
drew
me
to
buy
it
it
goes
down
smooth
but
has
an
ever
so
alcoholic
warming
characteristic
that
makes
this
not
ideal
for
sessioning
but
who
ever
said
doppelbocks
were
for
sessioning
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
try
it
sometime
over
the
past
year
or
so
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
try
a
few
dark
horse
beers
and
theyve
been
impressive
this
ones
probably
my
least
favorite
that
ive
tried
its
not
a
bad
effort
but
it
doesnt
deliver
like
id
hoped
i
really
think
a
more
prominent
coffee
flavor
might
change
that
itd
be
worth
a
shot
if
you
ask
me
perkulators
worth
a
try
if
you
run
across
but
go
for
the
single
bottle
rather
than
the
4pack
notes
another
expertly
crafted
beer
from
dark
horse
easily
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
you
know
in
the
end
i
like
this
its
enjoyable
i
wish
for
less
coffee
but
ill
enjoy
my
remaining
bottles
a
good
winter
drink
a
12
ounce
bottle
purchased
at
abes
in
bethlehem
for
around
1
75
poured
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
appears
the
color
of
cloudy
iced
tea
with
barely
a
finger
of
off
white
foam
no
lacing
to
speak
of
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
dark
brewed
coffee
coffee
grounds
a
bit
of
alcohol
caramel
vanilla
bittersweet
chocolate
nuts
just
about
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
and
a
mild
alcohol
burn
following
each
sip
pretty
tasty
the
coffee
is
in
check
not
over
the
top
this
is
a
great
drinking
coffee
brew
this
brew
works
a
great
concept
of
combining
the
doppelbock
and
coffee
i
hope
others
take
there
lead
average
drinkability
average
beer
worth
trying
though
if
you
are
in
to
the
whole
coffee
beer
thing
d
not
as
much
depth
as
i
was
hoping
for
but
kudos
for
the
flavor
conglomeration
within
the
style
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
one
i
probably
will
not
get
it
again
but
you
never
know
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
minimal
head
smell
is
of
freshly
brewed
medium
roast
coffee
maybe
slightly
watered
down
excellent
taste
of
medium
roasted
black
coffee
with
a
somewhat
nutty
background
slight
herbalfloral
thing
going
on
in
there
kiss
of
booze
noted
thinner
body
for
the
style
good
carbonation
interesting
brew
verry
good
tasting
but
the
lack
of
complexity
and
character
coupled
with
the
thin
body
keep
it
from
being
top
notch
the
simplest
way
i
can
think
of
to
describe
the
perkulator
is
that
its
like
chewing
a
dark
roast
coffee
bean
or
two
while
sipping
a
bottled
nonwidget
guiness
d
i
love
coffee
beers
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
you
would
have
to
have
an
affinity
for
coffee
to
enjoy
this
one
as
the
coffee
flavor
is
big
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
perfect
breakfast
beer
ill
have
a
hard
time
sharing
this
with
my
friends
delicious
ruby
muddled
thin
khaki
head
forms
with
minimal
lacing
another
dark
horse
brew
with
some
carbonation
issues
fizzy
head
dwindles
quick
as
hell
the
beer
is
a
coffee
infused
doppelbock
guess
what
gets
overshadowed
here
yep
the
malts
from
the
doppelbock
pure
coffee
the
nose
is
does
have
a
deep
malty
robust
caramel
nutty
edged
coffee
infusion
going
on
i
like
the
play
on
words
with
the
perkulator
and
a
demon
two
headed
goat
sitting
on
his
trone
thats
pretty
metal
boys
and
girls
flavor
is
strong
robust
nutty
coffee
with
a
touch
of
dark
cocoa
and
sweet
underlying
fruit
again
the
sweetness
is
played
way
down
by
the
deep
coffee
additions
a
really
roasty
brew
you
had
better
like
coffee
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slight
syrupy
texture
carbonation
slighly
fizzy
and
a
bit
cloying
at
times
for
me
drinkability
much
like
most
of
the
dark
horse
brewing
solid
expressive
creativity
at
its
best
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
was
not
as
a
doppelbock
extreme
beer
at
its
best
i
am
a
big
fan
of
dark
horse
brewery
because
they
seem
to
do
a
lot
of
really
different
beers
this
beer
is
no
different
the
combination
of
coffee
notes
and
a
dopplebock
doesnt
seem
like
itd
mix
very
well
but
it
really
does
the
caramel
notes
form
the
doppelbock
and
the
coffee
notes
mix
perfectly
the
beer
is
very
one
dimensional
but
its
still
very
tasty
the
nose
on
the
beer
is
a
slight
chocolatecoffee
note
but
first
and
foremost
its
a
coffee
flavour
i
like
the
coffee
flavour
a
lot
and
the
coffee
flavour
is
very
strong
so
if
youre
not
a
coffee
fan
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
other
than
that
i
really
enjoy
the
beer
future
outlook
hmm
interesting
brew
that
im
glad
to
have
tried
but
probably
wont
be
seeking
out
again
d
interesting
beer
i
guess
not
that
great
i
havent
read
any
reviews
on
it
so
im
not
sure
if
other
people
get
peppers
but
i
wasnt
expecting
it
and
to
say
the
least
its
sort
of
a
turn
off
in
the
coffee
the
body
is
silky
and
smooth
light
buttery
feel
left
in
the
mouth
flavors
of
sweet
caramel
malts
with
a
slight
sour
note
in
the
middle
coffee
presence
is
not
as
bold
as
i
expected
some
light
ground
coffee
flavor
but
mild
at
that
not
sure
the
age
on
this
beer
wondering
if
it
wore
off
a
bit
finishes
with
a
sweet
milk
chocolate
flavor
as
it
warms
still
this
is
quite
good
i
consumed
this
one
no
problem
and
wouldnt
mind
another
thanks
again
for
the
opportunity
brian
this
is
a
very
satisfactory
beer
its
got
one
of
the
freshest
and
most
flavorful
coffee
flavors
i
have
ever
had
in
a
beer
however
that
nice
flavor
comes
with
a
lack
of
complexity
i
am
used
to
this
would
be
an
excellent
breakfast
beer
well
worth
seeking
out
dark
horse
perkulator
coffee
dopplebock
pours
a
finger
of
foam
over
an
opaque
coffeecolored
brew
carbonation
is
moderate
and
the
nose
is
coffee
beans
the
flavor
is
sweet
rich
malt
up
front
with
notes
of
molasses
and
rum
with
sharp
coffee
beans
off
the
back
for
balance
mouthfeel
is
round
and
full
drying
a
bit
because
of
the
coffee
an
interesting
approach
theres
a
green
sort
of
a
something
in
the
aftertaste
so
i
know
theres
hops
in
this
thing
but
the
really
heavy
bittering
duties
here
are
carried
by
the
coffee
in
it
not
for
everyone
this
might
be
interesting
with
a
sticky
dessert
yum
really
diggin
the
nutty
smoothness
this
creates
within
its
coffee
buttering
this
is
a
keeper
and
i
will
call
perkulator
the
bigger
brother
to
furthermores
oscura
d
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
smelling
it
and
giggling
at
the
satanic
label
i
found
the
taste
did
not
match
up
with
the
aroma
and
was
a
good
beer
to
drink
because
i
like
coffee
but
found
cannot
run
with
the
big
coffee
beers
holy
crap
this
is
a
strange
one
pours
a
dark
brown
even
an
aggressive
pour
wont
get
you
a
head
on
this
one
it
smells
like
coffee
there
are
also
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
other
things
that
cant
really
be
deciphered
because
of
the
overwhelming
coffee
aroma
this
beer
tastes
exactly
how
you
would
imagine
a
dopplebock
if
you
dumped
a
bunch
of
dark
strong
coffe
in
it
the
most
dissapointing
things
about
this
beer
are
the
lack
of
head
and
the
thin
watery
mouthfeel
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
finish
it
leaves
a
very
pleasant
coffee
taste
that
lingers
forever
although
i
think
coffee
is
better
in
a
stout
or
porter
this
is
interesting
and
certainly
worth
trying
ok
drinkability
but
not
for
my
personal
taste
kinda
a
one
trick
pony
imo
d
its
like
these
guys
were
swinging
for
the
fences
but
instead
got
an
infield
single
i
know
you
were
hoping
for
a
lot
more
and
it
is
all
anticlimatic
but
thanks
to
a
little
luck
you
still
came
out
slightly
ahead
t
this
beer
has
a
soft
dry
dark
roasted
malt
flavor
that
quickly
gives
way
to
a
big
cold
coffee
ground
flavor
that
lingers
a
bit
m
this
beer
has
a
light
mouthfeel
with
a
tight
little
fizzy
finish
d
the
stale
coffee
ground
dominates
the
flavor
and
aroma
and
is
tough
to
get
through
a
full
beer
d
this
was
an
interesting
take
on
a
doppelbock
i
have
never
heard
of
a
coffee
doppelbock
and
dark
horse
has
yet
to
steer
me
wrong
this
is
definitely
worth
trying
however
i
would
pick
up
one
of
their
stouts
over
this
if
i
had
to
decide
between
dark
horse
brews
dark
brown
thats
maple
syrup
colored
around
the
edges
no
head
and
no
lacing
nice
aroma
of
fresh
ground
coffee
caramel
and
dark
fruit
theres
a
touch
of
earthiness
in
the
nose
as
is
light
chocolate
flavor
is
predominately
coffee
with
more
of
the
sugary
caramel
in
the
background
theres
a
light
hop
presence
thats
buried
underneath
all
the
malts
and
coffee
but
theyre
there
theres
a
light
spiciness
and
slight
warming
alcohol
on
the
finish
body
is
fantastic
on
this
beer
thick
chewy
tonguecoating
and
light
carbonation
all
in
all
a
good
coffee
beer
d
a
tasty
beer
but
not
one
i
would
think
of
fast
when
it
comes
to
coffee
infused
beers
the
base
beer
is
tastybut
i
dont
think
the
coffee
really
enhances
the
overall
flavor
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
its
a
one
trick
pony
and
i
quickly
lose
interest
im
glad
i
tried
it
once
but
at
the
same
time
am
glad
it
was
only
a
4pack
and
not
a
6pack
edit
my
caffeine
riddled
heart
actually
attempted
to
jump
out
of
my
chest
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
throttle
me
stupid
i
think
its
really
comparable
to
a
coffee
celebrator
d
docked
5
from
here
as
well
i
loved
the
brew
but
it
wasnt
as
good
once
it
was
still
aside
from
that
this
was
extremely
well
done
i
need
to
find
some
more
of
these
d
very
easy
to
drink
with
no
hint
of
alcohol
its
always
nice
to
find
a
coffee
beer
that
isnt
a
stout
or
porter
i
think
it
works
well
here
in
the
absence
of
roasted
grain
flavors
and
esters
id
pick
this
up
again
i
could
see
a
coffee
junkie
pulling
this
in
for
the
night
shift
not
bad
just
not
my
favorite
wow
is
the
first
reaction
on
tatsing
thsi
beer
i
am
a
coffee
lover
so
the
deep
rich
taste
of
a
full
body
coffee
shone
through
on
every
taste
of
this
beer
it
was
surprisngly
smooth
for
a
dopplebock
but
had
many
subtle
taste
complexities
the
cafeeniene
from
the
cofee
could
almost
be
felt
a
buddy
suggested
it
was
the
perfect
balnace
between
a
caffeine
rush
and
the
soothing
nature
of
beer
i
would
agree
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
coffee
and
hints
of
malt
really
though
it
is
all
coffee
very
pleasant
but
very
simple
luckily
there
is
a
lot
more
malt
in
the
taste
than
there
is
in
the
aroma
there
is
still
a
ton
of
coffee
though
maybe
too
much
yes
too
much
way
too
much
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
beer
has
the
biggest
coffee
character
of
any
coffee
beer
ive
yet
tasted
until
now
i
never
thought
i
would
think
a
beer
had
too
much
coffee
but
this
one
certainly
does
although
i
am
a
huge
coffee
beer
fan
i
have
never
been
a
coffee
drinker
this
beer
is
more
like
drinking
coffee
to
me
than
drinking
a
coffee
beer
drinkability
i
wouldnt
have
this
again
i
would
recommend
this
to
someone
who
seeks
a
strong
open
of
rich
coffee
and
a
malty
finish
despite
the
off
flavor
perkulator
looks
like
caramel
liquid
and
some
light
brown
color
and
ruby
red
when
up
to
some
light
a
quickly
fading
vanilla
cap
and
no
lacing
to
be
seen
coffee
is
the
main
scent
and
its
big
not
really
espresso
like
just
str8
coffee
under
that
is
a
dopple
with
some
sweet
malts
and
a
bit
of
a
roastburnt
thing
too
the
dopplebock
portion
of
this
beer
comes
out
more
in
taste
with
caramel
malt
among
others
ans
some
dark
fruit
with
pear
coffee
is
not
as
big
as
expected
from
the
smell
goes
down
smooth
with
a
slightly
lighter
than
medium
body
with
light
and
effective
carb
spot
on
not
the
most
balanced
beer
but
a
good
attempt
a
bit
high
in
abv
for
a
few
but
its
not
all
that
high
ho
hum
this
beer
is
really
nothing
very
special
review
from
notes
taken
on
11709
excellent
rich
roasty
flavor
that
becomes
a
bit
more
prominent
as
it
warms
up
roasted
smokey
toasted
nut
with
some
slight
lactic
creaminess
hazlenut
smoked
malt
creamy
milk
chocolate
slight
spice
character
and
subtle
hops
a
bit
thin
for
my
liking
but
not
to
where
is
has
too
much
of
an
affect
on
the
beer
nice
balance
of
coffee
dark
fruit
notes
and
chocolate
the
roasted
character
is
not
overbearing
which
is
a
nice
change
of
ace
adding
complexity
and
avoiding
the
one
dimensionality
of
many
coffee
beers
abv
well
masked
makng
it
pretty
easy
to
drink
forget
founders
breakfast
stout
this
is
the
real
beer
for
coffee
lovers
very
good
brew
wasnt
sure
how
a
nonstoutbrown
coffee
beer
was
going
to
be
but
this
might
be
a
better
idea
given
the
sweetbalancing
act
and
not
something
id
reach
for
every
day
but
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
coffee
beer
thats
got
some
balance
reach
here
if
you
like
coffee
you
will
love
this
beer
coffee
is
the
main
component
and
may
be
overwhleming
for
some
so
keep
that
in
mind
i
really
liked
this
one
good
mouthfeel
pretty
smoth
soft
carbonation
some
suggestion
of
alcohol
but
not
hot
or
boozy
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
here
interesting
twist
on
a
classic
style
hazy
slightly
reddish
cola
colored
with
a
light
tan
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
a
ring
of
tiny
bubbles
with
dots
of
lacing
strong
coffee
notes
in
aroma
with
roasted
malt
slightly
sweet
caramely
no
hop
presence
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
a
soso
doppelbock
with
a
strong
punch
of
coffee
the
bock
adds
a
caramel
sweetness
that
nicely
balances
out
the
bitterness
of
the
coffee
the
coffee
is
more
of
a
roasted
flavor
or
anything
too
intense
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
strong
carbonation
results
in
a
very
frothy
light
body
the
addition
of
coffee
to
this
style
isnt
doing
that
much
for
me
its
nicely
balanced
but
leaves
me
wanting
a
good
doppelbock
or
a
good
coffee
stout
instead
now
this
is
an
interesting
beer
the
beer
was
a
hazy
brown
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
most
definitely
of
coffee
the
taste
follows
through
with
an
assertive
coffee
flavor
you
almost
feel
like
youre
drinking
coffee
then
there
is
a
surprising
and
completely
unexpected
chocolate
note
at
the
end
it
had
a
very
interesting
mouthfeel
maybe
acidic
but
it
definitely
left
a
tingle
on
the
tongue
drinkability
very
drinkable
brew
smooth
and
quite
complex
sam
said
that
he
had
been
sitting
on
this
bottle
for
a
while
but
i
doubt
age
helped
or
hurt
it
coffee
doesnt
belong
in
such
a
clean
brew
i
will
stand
by
this
thanks
amigo
but
this
did
not
do
it
for
me
d
interesting
drink
seems
that
it
would
pair
well
with
certain
foods
and
cheese
however
this
beer
wears
on
the
taste
buds
as
it
warms
becoming
overly
sweet
and
syrupy
overall
a
pretty
interesting
beer
worth
a
shot
dark
horse
perkulator
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
quickly
dissipated
aroma
was
coffee
the
taste
was
malty
coffee
nothing
special
the
feel
was
a
little
watery
to
me
with
some
carbonation
to
tickle
the
tongue
this
one
was
an
easy
drinker
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
drinkability
while
its
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
i
do
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
complex
as
the
coffee
is
really
about
all
there
is
to
it
and
the
body
could
hold
a
bit
more
substance
drinkability
not
too
bad
tastes
pretty
nice
but
as
for
match
to
style
its
not
like
any
doppelbock
ive
had
before
its
missing
that
bready
attribute
that
seems
common
to
most
ive
had
overall
a
good
beer
im
glad
i
tried
a
little
dry
nicely
carbonated
very
smooth
velvety
mouthfeel
im
really
liking
this
beer
wish
they
could
have
brought
out
more
of
the
dark
fruity
drinkability
is
good
fans
of
coffee
will
not
find
problems
with
this
brew
while
those
who
enjoy
coffee
flavors
only
when
mixed
in
with
an
equal
amount
of
dark
malt
this
ba
will
find
it
a
bit
deflating
that
beig
said
the
brew
itself
does
work
well
drinkability
is
fairly
high
the
alcohol
is
moderately
high
however
its
well
incorporated
into
the
beer
the
flavor
profile
though
not
completely
acurate
is
quite
pleasing
which
makes
for
an
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
experience
pours
dark
brown
with
reddish
hues
aroma
consists
of
caramel
roasted
coffee
touch
of
dark
fruit
and
toffee
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
soft
roasted
coffee
flavor
with
some
bitterness
from
the
hops
coffee
flavor
solid
malt
backbone
doppelbock
characteristics
really
emerge
toward
the
back
when
you
can
taste
a
rumsoaked
raisin
fruitiness
and
caramel
conclusion
this
is
an
enjoyable
and
different
take
on
a
coffee
beer
pretty
nice
d
if
you
are
a
serious
coffee
drinker
like
me
you
will
absolutely
love
this
beer
i
have
no
idea
how
long
this
was
aged
due
to
a
lack
of
bottled
date
but
however
long
it
was
aged
for
made
this
a
spectacular
doppelbock
drinks
a
tad
slow
the
heft
coffee
presence
a
better
breakfast
beer
than
a
dopple
per
se
but
would
happily
down
a
few
of
these
at
breakfast
a
very
nice
beer
that
is
a
first
for
me
as
i
was
skeptical
that
a
coffee
infused
doublebock
would
float
my
boat
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
i
think
a
sixer
would
take
quite
a
long
time
to
go
through
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown

lighter
hues
of
amber

edges
and
bottom

an
doppelbock

strongly

up

comes
through
next
some
sweet
malt
faintly
and
the
finish
is
roasted
malt
once
the
bitterness
pasts
the
mouth
feel
is
slightly
watery
overall
the
coffee
flavor
is
just
too
strong
and
overpowers
the
other
characteristics
of
a
doppelbock
12
ounce

the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
is
ok
but
not
much

the
aroma
is
mostly
coffee
but
i
can
also
smell
some
caramel
malt
chocolate
and
nuts
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
coffee
is
the
strongest
taste
but
theres
also
some
grain
caramel
raisins
and
chocolate
noticable
too
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
creamy
and
its
also
smooth
and
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
it
goes
down
easy
and
its
enjoyable
to
drink
i
think
its
a
good
overall
brew
id
pick
this
one
up
again
purchased
at
rays
liquors
in
wauwatosa
wi
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
nothing
metallic
coffee
aroma
with
strong
coffee
flavor
from
start
to
finish
some
sweet
malt
flavor
is
slightly
detectable
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
this
is
basically
a
chilled
coffee
with
alcohol
good
thing
i
like
iced
coffee
or
this
would
get
a
worse
review
bonus
points
for
having
the
most
metal
beer
label
ive
ever
seen
m
i
love
dark
horse
pours
a
dark
woody
brown
with
a
thin
tan

the
nose
has
freshly
roasted
coffee
over
fruity
malts
caramel
and
spices
taste
has
sweet
malts
figs
carmelized
sugars
which
are
all
well
balanced
by
the
bitter
coffe
flavors
medium
body
matches
style
well
good
session
beer
d
good
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
but
not
too
thick
or
overpowering
especially
if
you
like
coffee
id
have
another
a
very
enjoyable
beer
im
thinking
of
pairing
this
with
a
nice
coffeecake
and
when
i
find
a
recipe
for
one
ill
do
just
that
cheers
an
interesting
beer
but
lacking
the
large
malt
character
typically
found
in
a
good
dopple
and
the
coffee
overpowers
it
a
bit
as
a
result
d
rich
and
malty
doppelbock
with
an
interesting
coffee
component
id
refrain
from
a
second
of
this
but
overall
a
decent
tasting
brew
mellows
out
as
it
warms
to
room
temp
and
im
loosing
some
of
that
unique
and
sharp
aroma
a
goodbut
sadly
not
great
doppelbock
i
expected
more
of
a
coffee
kick
to
the
teeth
which
never
came
d
eh
not
for
me
im
not
gonna
slam
this
one
because
its
doing
what
it
is
intended
to
do
and
all
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
authentic
and
well
done
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
oddly
ive
never
been
able
to
find
a
coffee
beer
that
i
like
despite
that
i
drink
so
much
espresso
that
i
bleed
black
i
love
coffee
in
all
of
its
incarnations
except
beer
and
i
love
beer
in
all
of
its
varioius
presentations
except
when
its
with
coffee
whats
up
with
that
then
i
began
tasting
a
more
and
more
sour
flavor
it
was
like
sour
milk
it
wasnt
overwhelming
but
seriously
hurt
my
overall
perception
toward
the
brew
it
was
a
bold
and
unique
offering
just
not
a
great
beer
i
could
drink
it
again
but
wont
go
outta
my
way
for
it
when
i
picked
this
up
i
didnt
look
that
closely
at
it
i
expected
to
be
drinking
a
strait
up
dopplebock
the
appearance
is
similar
to
tea
with
very
little
head
strait
up
coffee
on
the
nose
with
just
a
bit
of
fruity
maltyness
flavor
is
the
same
the
coffee
flavor
is
slightly
burnt
its
almost
like
chewing
a
coffee
bean
and
washing
it
down
with
sparkling
water
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
not
too
much
dopplebock
stickiness
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
session
beer
but
certainly
one
that
wont
slow
you
down
if
youre
mixing
and
matching
a
little
put
off
by
appearance
light
almost
weak
coffee
appearance
absolutley
no
head
retention
weird
aroma
is
off
the
charts
fantastic
smells
like
a
bag
full
of
freah
coffee
beans
taste
is
spot
on
coffee
as
well
the
sweet
malts
of
a
doppelbock
come
through
in
a
delicate
manner
allowing
the
coffee
flavor
to
shine
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
not
thin
like
coffee
again
the
doppelbock
overall
a
phenomenal
collaboration
between
two
of
my
favorite
beverages
would
love
to
get
more
info
on
the
technical
aspects
how
to
of
this
fantastic
brew
easy
drinking
very
enjoyable
sessionable
didnt
get
the
coffee
though
not
very
complex
this
is
an
extremely
unique
doppelbock
and
as
a
big
coffee
lover
this
one
really
worked
well
for
me
a
great
beer
overall
this
is
another
good
beer
from
the
dark
horse
brewing
i
think
it
is
quite
drinkable
although
it
would
be
hard
to
have
more
than
2
i
think
this
is
a
good
addition
to
the
dopplebocks
as
it
is
quite
unique
and
quite
good
pours
a
dark
caramel
color
with
a
one
finger
dirty
white
foamy
head
ample
carbonation
comes
from
the
beer
smells
like
coffee
chocolate
and
malt
taste
is
strongly
of
coffee
surprise
caramel
and
malt
has
a
bit
of
chicory
in
the
aftertaste
and
not
overly
sweet
like
some
doppelbocks
d
inyourface
taste
and
guessing
higher
than
average
abv
make
this
beer
good
for
a
couple
but
not
good
for
a
whole
night
admittedly
i
do
not
have
much
experience
in
the
realm
of
dopplebocks
the
coffee
flavor
was
certainly
present
but
by
no
means
overwhelming
and
i
found
this
to
be
an
odd
yet
charming
brew
overall
however
if
you
dislike
coffeeflavored
beers
then
this
is
probably
not
gonna
be
your
thing
i
bought
a
fourpack
out
of
curiosity
and
im
pleased
to
say
that
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
md
full
bodied
bit
over
carbonated
but
slightly
smooth
drinkability
is
ok
a
pretty
complex
beer
more
of
a
sipper
than
anything
however
its
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
is
a
genuine
pleasure
making
this
hard
not
to
quaff
if
purchasers
are
expecting
dopplebock
be
forewarned
that
this
is
coffee
front
and
center
dopplebock
down
the
road
yet
others
might
find
this
a
truer
representative
of
dopplebock
than
i
did
and
should
enjoy
it
regardless
good
stuff
easy
drinker
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
nice
goes
down
easy
with
cookies
or
chocolate
very
good
i
had
this
once
before
on
draught
and
enjoyed
much
more
notes
this
to
me
is
a
one
time
beer
or
special
occasion
type
thing
i
dont
like
coffee
enough
to
sacrifice
my
beer
with
the
flavor
but
overall
not
bad
d
good
beer
for
cold
weather
but
id
probably
only
have
one
dgood
odd
ball
beer
for
me
the
combination
works
nicely
id
drink
it
again
but
it
certainly
isnt
in
my
beer
hall
of
fame
i
only
bought
a
single
of
this
and
i
have
to
say
i
wouldnt
by
another
one
if
i
had
the
chance
dark
horse
makes
some
excellent
beers
though
this
one
is
definitely
not
for
me
pours
out
as
a
slightly
hazy
brownamber
with
just
a
faint
head
nose
is
strong
coffee
grounds
taste
is
acidic
malty
coffee
with
some
warming
alcohol
a
bit
abrasive
but
not
bad
lots
of
coffee
flavor
mouthfeel
is
good
good
brew
not
dark
horses
best
but
a
pretty
unique
departure
from
the
typical
coffee
stoutporter
nice
to
see
coffee
being
tried
in
different
styles
a
pretty
dark
brown
pour
with
an
off
white
head
aroma
is
mostly
coffee
with
a
bit
of
malt
and
nut
flavor
is
actually
not
that
different
than
the
aroma
there
is
not
much
dopplebock
in
this
one
roasty
coffee
accented
with
some
toffee
and
a
hint
of
mocha
rather
lively
carbonation
just
the
faintest
bit
of
fuitlager
type
flavor
in
the
through
it
is
a
bit
light
but
is
very
drinkable
and
a
lot
of
flavor
compared
to
most
beers
this
drinkable
certainly
unique
this
is
the
type
of
brew
that
isnt
going
to
have
too
many
people
in
between
on
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
wonderful
balance
with
a
deliberate
and
well
executed
coffee
backbone
the
malt
bill
is
nice
because
there
is
some
nice
dopplebock
oomph
in
there
as
well
great
original
beer
from
a
great
forward
thinking
brewery
from
my
home
state
da
coffee
lovers
dbock
really
fresh
coffee
flavour
with
a
wellbalnced
creamy
sweetness
only
the
second
coffee
dbock
i
have
ever
had
ithaca
beer
companys
kaffinator
being
the
onther
i
am
a
fan
d
i
dont
know
the
alcohol
level
on
this
one
but
the
coffee
flavor
would
keep
me
hanging
around
d
went
down
fairly
easy
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
all
night
long
murky
looking
dark
crimson
thin
beige
head
sparse
lace
the
aroma
is
thick
with
coffee
used
coffee
grounds
heavily
roasted
used
coffee
grounds
this
is
thick
the
taste
is
thick
with
coffee
too
if
you
like
coffee
youll
love
this
beer
its
definitely
a
coffee
beer
first
dopplebock
second
thats
not
a
bad
thing
its
a
good
beer
but
not
really
a
dopplebock
in
flavor
lingering
bitterness
from
coffee
bean
alcohol
is
negligible
decent
attempt
at
an
odd
combination
gotta
say
i
really
dig
this
beer
and
the
idea
bold
complex
flavors
very
nutty
in
nature
with
huge
caramel
malt
complex
with
a
generous
amount
of
espresso
with
cream
compliments
the
malts
nicely
an
twinge
of
milk
chocolate
and
toffee
just
a
fine
beer
easy
drinking
and
delicous
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
finish
of
great
length
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
great
beer
i
love
coffee
stouts
and
this
was
a
good
adaptation
of
that
idea
somewhat
more
drinkable
and
still
delicious
i
should
start
drinking
this
in
the
morning
mouthfeel
is
of
a
good
weight
low
carbonation
oily
amazing
flavor
yum
the
mouth
is
mildly
creamy
with
a
nice
smooth
finish
the
aftertaste
of
chocolate
remains
for
quite
a
while
and
is
rather
pleasant
medium
body
very
drinkable
if
i
had
to
guess
the
abv
id
put
it
in
the
4
55
range
recommended
overall
i
was
drawn
by
the
idea
of
a
coffee
dopplebock
ive
seen
plenty
of
coffee
stouts
but
this
style
was
new
to
me
its
a
pretty
big
departure
from
most
doppelbocks
ive
tried
but
im
a
pretty
big
fan
it
definitely
has
solid
coffee
flavor
but
isnt
so
overthetop
that
you
wouldnt
want
another
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
and
served
in
a
dimpled
mug
this
dopplebock
poured
a
murky
ruby
brown
hue
with
a
shortlived
head
of
tan
foam
that
settled
into
a
lasting
ring
a
small
amount
of
slippery
lacing
was
left
behind
the
aroma
had
a
very
pronouced
note
of
cold
pressed
coffee
a
solid
dose
of
caramel
and
dark
fruit
also
made
an
appearance
the
flavor
contained
a
smooth
coffee
note
not
bitter
like
alot
of
other
coffeeinfused
beers
dark
fruit
skins
caramel
and
a
hint
of
bakers
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
was
fullbodied
and
had
light
carbonation
filling
for
sure
but
yet
quite
drinkable
very
enjoyable
nice
to
see
the
guys
at
dark
horse
give
a
lager
a
try
d
drinks
like
a
champ
for
an
8
dopplebock
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
is
nonexistent
the
coffee
character
wins
out
in
the
end
making
for
an
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
dopplebock
one
of
the
highlights
of
my
recent
midwest
excursion
pours
a
cola
and
ruby
brown
with
practically
no
head
or
foam
cant
see
any
bubbling
in
this
dark
brew
smells
like
when
you
just
break
open
a
folgers
tin
and
take
a
whiff
plus
the
sweet
dark
toasted
malts
and
fruits
add
a
little
complexity
to
the
nose
the
taste
starts
with
undeniable
coffee
you
then
get
some
of
that
signature
dopplebock
malt
character
toasted
and
sweet
with
some
woody
plums
t
to
metion
a
toucof
smokiness
too
is
that
from
the
coffee
or
malt
chewy
sweet
palate
that
is
complex
and
different
from
the
norm
a
good
beer
to
drink
and
think
contemplate
and
enjoy
i
like
the
coffee
flavors
even
if
im
not
a
big
fan
of
coffee
it
works
with
this
style
of
brew
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
finish
and
that
distracts
from
the
overall
enjoyment
of
the
brew
overall
this
one
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
is
recommended
to
any
fan
of
coffee
beers
overall
i
really
liked
this
and
thought
it
was
a
rather
interesting
concept
to
say
the
least
i
would
love
to
get
another
actually
as
it
was
a
welcome
change
of
pace
for
me
and
fit
in
nicely
with
the
german
styles
i
have
been
trying
as
of
late
another
very
enjoyable
brew
from
dark
horse
initially
bought
this
as
a
single
will
probably
grab
a
four
pack
tonight
or
tomorrow
overall
recommended
especially
as
a
oneoff
purchase
a
4pack
would
be
sufficient
for
me
oh
and
the
artwork
is
killer
especially
the
evil
version
perkulator
is
another
well
made
beer
by
dark
horse
the
flavor
is
good
and
its
nice
to
find
a
coffee
beer
where
the
coffee
acts
as
a
compliment
to
the
beer
instead
of
the
main
component
from
a
12oz
bottle
pours
a
clear
root
beer
color
with
small
quickly
dissipating
head
below
average
carbonation
smells
only
of
coffee
and
not
much
else
in
the
nose
first
sip
is
all
coffee
and
more
coffee
there
is
a
fairly
nice
malt
backbone
very
nice
very
drinkable
excellent
bitter
finish
d
more
of
a
novelty
i
doubt
i
would
want
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
a
must
try
for
the
coffee
lovers
out
there
dark
horse
wins
again
refreshing
not
over
powering
d
this
is
what
it
is
a
beer
dominated
by
coffee
fun
experiment
not
exactly
one
for
the
purists
i
will
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
4
pack
thanks
to
aqsprint
for
this
one
overall
this
is
a
noble
experiment
and
for
the
most
part
executed
well
however
it
seems
to
rely
too
much
on
the
coffee
to
provide
bitterness
and
the
end
result
is
a
slightly
unbalanced
brew
coffee
fans
should
definitely
try
this
but
overall
id
rather
have
a
fourpack
of
dark
horses
noncaffeinated
doppelbock
offering
it
was
nice
to
see
a
doppelbock
getting
in
on
the
coffee
action
that
seems
mostly
limited
to
porters
and
stouts
the
malty
nature
of
the
doppelbock
really
complements
the
coffee
flavor
and
makes
it
drink
like
an
alcoholic
iced
coffee
which
is
both
a
strength
and
a
weakness
as
it
makes
this
brew
a
little
shallow
d
while
this
beer
does
not
seem
to
match
up
with
traditional
doppelbocks
in
terms
of
fitting
into
style
guidelines
the
beer
still
tastes
and
feels
great
and
drinks
way
way
too
easy
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
then
again
i
am
a
coffee
lover
could
look
a
bit
better
though
this
is
very
unique
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
something
i
would
recommend
to
coffee
lovers
and
those
that
want
something
different
perkulator
pours
a
mahogany
brown
color
with
some
orangered
highlights
and
a
small
tan
head
the
nose
and
taste
share
similar
notes
of
bourbon
wet
wood
sweet
molasses
coffee
bean
whiskey
malt
or
corn
mash
and
very
musky
cherry
vanilla
sweetness
the
alcohol
content
is
not
threatening
coffee
doesnt
come
through
as
bright
as
had
been
expected
but
it
plays
a
critical
role
in
its
bitterness
and
overall
texture
full
bodied
this
is
a
large
brew
great
stuff
though
very
drinkable
this
is
a
great
coffee
beer
for
its
balance
in
my
opinion
too
many
coffee
beers
are
all
about
the
beans
with
beer
just
acting
as
a
prop
perkulator
pairs
the
smooth
malty
caramel
of
a
doppelbock
with
fresh
darkroasted
coffee
and
im
loving
it
easy
to
drink
from
the
nottoothick
for
a
doppel
body
and
delicious
a
musttry
for
fans
of
coffee
beer
pours
a
deep
mahogany
brown
with
not
so
much
a
head
as
a
mild
fizzing
that
sticks
around
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
smells
of
coffee
and
a
malty
sweetness
and
a
mild
breadlike
smell
taste
is
malty
chocolaty
coffee
with
the
coffee
dominating
the
finish
notes
of
cinnamon
poke
out
as
the
glass
warms
a
bit
the
coffee
has
definitely
toned
down
in
the
6
months
or
so
since
i
purchased
it
but
i
think
that
is
actually
an
improvement
as
the
other
flavors
of
the
beverage
are
allowed
to
come
forward
overall
another
solid
wellbalanced
brew
from
darkhorse
that
i
could
sit
and
drink
all
evening
and
probably
will
tastes

thanks
hoppymeal
for
the
opportunity
this
is
a

good
carbonation
kind
of
finishes
a
little
thin
for
a
dopplebock
but
that
doesnt
seem
to
be
the
problem
it
doesnt
taste
like
your
typical
dopplebock
i
like
this
beer
but
i
wish
the
coffee
could
play
as
just
another
flavor
in
the
mix
and
not
overwhelm
the
malt
pours
dark
maroon
with
a
large
medium
sized
beige
head
smell
is
of
sweet
maltiness
and
nice
strong
coffee
taste
is
about
what
id
expect
from
the
name
rich
and
malty
as
expected
from
a
dopplebock
with
a
nice
coffee
flavor
as
well
finishes
more
malty
with
little
coffee
flavor
at
the
end
pretty
nice
and
drinkable
medium
to
slightly
rich
body
with
good
carbonation
fairly
noticeable
tartness
in
the
finish
that
detracted
somewhat
drinkability
yet
again
dark
horse
blows
me
away
my
main
man
tpd975
was
right
when
he
sang
the
praises
of
this
brewery
this
is
a
great
brew
if
you
like
coffee
but
if
you
dont
it
probably
wont
be
your
favorite
the
aftertaste
can
be
slightly
sweet
but
that
is
about
the
only
negative
big
thanks
again
to
derek
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
fluffy
one
finger
light
khaki
colored
head
that
takes
its
time
to
die
down
a
small
layer
of
foam
sticks
to
the
sides
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
throughout
the
entire
tasting
smell
is
coffee
grinds
and
bitter
chocolate
up
front
sweet
caramel
malt
underneath
with
a
woody
scent
as
well
alcohol
is
present
but
not
over
the
top
very
enjoyable
in
the
nose
i
could
whiff
this
all
day
and
morning
slight
bitterness
on
the
first
sip
with
a
big
coffee
backbone
i
was
hoping
for
more
sweet
caramel
malt
but
the
coffee
flavor
all
over
the
tongue
some
smokey
wood
flavors
and
a
bit
of
molasses
in
the
aftertaste
medium
grainy
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
not
as
creamy
as
id
like
with
the
style
but
ill
take
it
interesting
twist
on
the
doppelbock
not
sure
i
like
it
though
definitely
give
this
a
try
if
you
love
your
mornin
cupajoe
if
not
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
your
way
getting
your
hands
on
it
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
good
steady
carbonation
goes
down
fairly
easy
but
it
doesnt
have
the
chewiness
i
was
somewhat
expecting
overall
an
interesting
experiment
of
a
beer
but
nothing
really
ends
up
drawing
me
in
as
far
as
coffee
beers
goes
its
not
my
cup
of
tea
thanks
to

the
bottom
line
dark
horse
has
done
a
decent
job
pairing
up
the
classic
doppelbock
flavour
with
java
i
would
personally
prefer
the
fullon
malts
of
a
pure
doppelbock
or
the
aggressive
coffee
flavour
of
a
stout
or
coffee
tinted
porter
personally
but
you
can
do
worse

but
a
solid
beer
drinkability
true
i
was
more
than
a
bit
wary
of
this
combination
but
it
turned
out
alright
mouthfeel
is
medium

semisweet
up

with
a

finish
d
extremely
nice
i
loved
the
mixture
of
coffee
and
doppelbock
leave
it
to
dark
horse
overall
a
nicely
executed
novel
approach
to
a
coffee
beer
others
typically
infuse
coffee
into
stouts
or
maybe
porters
but
it
works
with
a
doppelbock
as
well
pours
a
nice
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
vibrant
white
head
that
leaves
some
sturdy
lacing
that
goes
away
as
the
beer
warms
the
smell
is
dominated
by
roasted
coffee
and
some
caramel
sweetness
the
taste
is
mildly
sweet
with
some
prominent
coffee
flavor
and
bit
of
fruitiness
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
syrupy
which
suits
this
style
well
i
really
like
this
beer
especially
for
the
price
the
sweetness
lends
itself
well
as
an
after
dinner
drink
an
easy
slow
sipper
here
recommended
im
praying
for
an
imperializedsupersized
version
someday
in
the
future

execution

very
smooth
despite
the
coffee
flavour
it
does
not
drink
anything
like
a

this
is
an
interesting
and
unusual
beer
i
thought
the
nose
was
unbalanced
with
coffee
but
the
flavor
is
balanced
and
is
both
interesting
and
subtle
i
have
no
idea
what
the
abv
may
be
but
i
suspect
that
there
is
a
high
abv
that
is
well
hidden
go
out
and
get
this
tasty
treat
d
a
very
interesting
beer
for
a
doppelbock
i
did
not
find
this
to
be
overly
rich
or
anything
worth
checking
out
overall
this
is
an
above
average
coffee
beer
and
a
mediocre
bock
though
im
glad
dark

went
for
this
experiment
and
eschewed
the
portersstoutsonly
path
for
its

great
potential
still
with
this
combination
i
give
credit
to
dark

for
their
willingness
to
experiment

this
one
just
didnt

i
want
to
like
atwater
as
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
michigan
craft
beers
and
detroit
has
a
small
piece
of
my
heart
but
i
have
just
not
had
anything
from
atwater
that
has
gotten
me
excited
this
beer
is
as
dark
as
a
stout
smells
tastes
almost
like
a
stout
i
can
hardly
tell
if
this
is
even
lagered
will
not
be
going
for
this
one
again
this
is
9
5
which
is
mind
boggling
theres
no
evidence
of
booze
but
the
flavor
isnt
strong
enough
to
imply
that
much
malt
i
found
this
beer
to
be
slightly
above
expectations
to
start
with
and
it
just
kept
better
and
better
by
the
sip
black
pour
with
a
small

some

without

can
also
taste
a

a

the

you
really
have
to
get
your

an

you
can
only
see

held

up

cool
label
overall
an
overly
chocolate
and
most
likely
not
well
fermenated
doppelbock
no
cleanness
and
way
too
one
sided
the
charred
and
fruity
characters
are
offputting
either
this
beer
has
changed
or
my
palate
has
used
to
really
like
it
seems
oxidized
overall
a
solid
brew
it
needs
to
warm
to
acceptable
tasting
levels
to
get
the
full
experience
as
some
of
the
flavors
are
tamed
by
the
colder
temps
a
touch
more
roast
presence
than
other
doppelbocks
a
good
doppelbock
im
still
a
sucker
for
the
germans
voodoo
vator
is
an
easy
drinker
that
is
not
to
filling
o
decent
bock
and
id
have
it
again
but
the
imports
feature
so
many
that
are
just
superior
beer
is
medium
to
in
body
with
fairly
low
levels
of
carbonation
resulting
in
a
somewhat
stagnant
flat
feeling
a
bit
more
carbonation
would
enhance
the
perception
on
the
mouth
and
perhaps
accentuate
the
flavors
of
the
beer
better
there
is
no
apparent
ethanol
perceived
closes
quite
dry
with
substantial
stickiness
lingering
on
the
lips
and
palate
my
introduction
to
the
atwater
family
of
beers
it
pours
a
rather
dark
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
deep
caramel
light
roasted
malts
graham
cracker
dark
breads
and
a
twinge
of
cocoa
powder
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
sweetness
inherent
in
the
smell
coming
through
a
bit
subdued
the
breadiness
taking
firm
control
theres
a
touch
of
vague
fruit
in
the
finish
but
it
doesnt
stick
around
long
enough
for
any
sort
of
positive
confirmation
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
mostly
smooth
feel
overall
a
pretty
nice
dbock
one
that
doesnt
overdo
it
in
any
category
save
drinkability
o
overall
a
decent
doppelbock
flavor
is
on
the
light
side
but
good
needs
a
fuller
body
and
slightly
more
depth
would
help
it
out
would
pass
next
time
looks
very
black
with
a
malt
colored
cap
appearing
after
a
quick
one
finger
settle
smells
of
roasted
malt
tastes
like
pumpernickel
bread
and
roasted
malt
light
to
medium
carbonation
feels
thin
chocolate
aftertaste
high
abv
and
toasted
bread
taste
make
it
worth
a
try
this
poured
nicely
forming
two
fingers
of
foamy
mochabrown
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deepbrown
with
garnetruby
highlights
nose
was
malty
sweet
but
subdued
i
have
had
some
in
the
style
that
were
syrupy
sweet
for
me
less
sweet
a
good
thing
mouthfeel
was
big
and
full
to
the
point
that
i
thought
that
i
had
a
spoonful
of
pudding
in
my
gob
whoa
this
was
extremely
smooth
with
faint
tastes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
and
some
heat
i
got
my
first
swallow
down
and
a
moment
later
it
hit
me
with
the
kick
of
a
missouri
mule
finish
was
likewise
semisweet
and
i
also
got
lingering
flavors
of
salt
and
licorice
i
have
not
been
wildly
impressed
with
atwater
beers
up
until
now
but
this
was
a
very
good
beer
o
the
taste
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
to
me
nothing
much
there
really
too
mild
overall
a
solid
double
bock
here
sweet
and
roasty
but
balanced
o
this
beer
is
very
nice
but
could
use
a
little
more
body
in
my
opinion
overall
a
good
beer
and
one
worth
a
try
cheers
overall
pretty
good
but
it
feels
pretty
precariously
balanced
and
its
neither
particularly
clean
nor
flashy
i
feel
like
hanging
on
to
it
for
another
month
or
two
would
be
a
bad
idea
but
if
you
can
get
it
fresh
its
worth
trying
this
is
a
good
beer
it
is
just
miscategorized
notes
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
cheers
overall
easy
to
drink
alcohol
is
hidden
flawed
but
ok
poured
a
darker
mahogany
brown
color
with
a
shortlived
eggshellwhite
head
aroma
of
toasted
grains
light
hints
of
cocoa
and
cardboard
really
nothing
wrong
with
the
taste
at
all
here
dark
malts
toasted
grains
nutty
woody
dry
leafy
and
earthy
hops
used
in
subdued
moderation
most
notably
wheres
the
alcohol
goes
down
way
too
easy
for
sure
with
9abv
almost
completely
hidden
which
garners
extra
points
for
drinkability
not
bad
at
all
originally
reviewed

o
this
is
a
beer
that
has
been
on
my
mind
for
some
time
now
and
i
just
had
to
give
it
a
shot
when
first
tasting
one
starts
to
gets
a
slight
tingle
on
the
tongue
with
nice
roasted
black
coffee
notes
with
slight
very
slight
sweet
notes
this
was
great
i
love
the
roasted
taste
and
i
love
the
black
coffee
but
the
alcohol
and
hops
destroy
any
other
flavor
coming
through
and
for
a
doublebock
its
not
that
sweet
one
should
note
that
the
beer
was
alot
better
as
it
got
warmer
i
let
one
bottle
get
almost
luke
warm
before
this
review
and
it
was
far
better
still
not
the
worst
beer
i
have
had
with
everything
said
this
was
a
ok
beer
with
a
high
abv
overall
while
i
was
excited
by
the
aromas
in
this
brew
the
flavors
didnt
quite
match
up
the
promise
and
i
was
especially
disappointed
in
how
fast
the
flavors
faded
with
multiple
sips
the
beer
is
not
bad
by
any
means
in
fact
even
after
a
few
sips
there
are
still
enough
flavors
standing
out
to
make
me
continue
drinking
but
i
wanted
a
bit
more
out
of
this
one
from
a
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
the
label
clipped
at
september
2012
sampled
on
january
28
2012
the
pour
is
very
dark
brown
to
nearly
black
with
little
to
no
head
accompanying
it
the
aroma
is
mellower
than
the
9
5
abv
might
suggest
with
sweet
malts
hints
of
coffee
and
a
subtle
hop
character
the
body
falls
into
the
medium
range
as
for
the
taste
i
get
some
toasted
dark
malts
in
the
beginning
with
an
average
bitterness
and
clean
hops
at
the
end
the
beer
is
enjoyable
enough
but
not
out
of
the
ordinary
o
very
good
beer
for
the
style
it
plays
like
a
melody
of
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
bitter
kick
this
is
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
or
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
enjoyable
but
doesnt
get
the
respect
it
deserves
on
here
weird
the
smell
of
coffee
bold

this
beer
is
on
my
to
drink
list
part
of
a
batch
of
beers
i
got
while
on
the
road
for
work
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pokal
the
beer
is
a
dark
deep
almost
black
rubybrown
coloring
with
a
thin
small
bubbled
light
tan
colored
head
that
settles
out
into
a
thin
film
aromas
of
rich
smokey
molasses
and
sweet
caramel
invade
the
nostrils
flavors
give
a
roasted
coffee
character
first
and
foremost
with
an
underlying
hint
of
the
dark
rich
molasses
a
smokey
highlight
and
a
hint
of
licorice
for
all
of
the
sweet
attributes
the
beer
remains
very
well
balanced
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
the
smoke
and
roasted
coffee
with
the
sweetness
regressing
rapidly
from
the
palate
leaving
you
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
tasty
brew
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
an
ok
doppelbock
for
being
classified
as
a
doppelbock
it
really
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
things
that
you
would
associate
with
the
style
its
pretty
dark
had
some
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
and
had
a
low
amount
of
sweetness
the
thing
that
really
surprises
me
about
this
beer
is
the
drinkability
it
goes
down
super
smooth
i
dont
pick
up
any
booze
in
this
beer
i
dont
know
how
the
hell
they
hid
the
9
5
but
they
did
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
drinkability
and
aroma
it
goes
down
super
smooth
with
no
harsh
booze
taste
and
the
aroma
was
pretty
chocolaty
not
normal
for
the
style
but
still
good
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
flavor
and
the
body
the
flavor
was
just
too
plain
and
subdued
and
the
body
was
just
a
little
too
light
i
wont
mind
drinking
these
in
the
holiday
pack
but
i
wont
seek
them
out
on
their
own
this
beer
is
still
worth
trying
the
drinkability
will
really
surprise
you
it
seemed
like
atwater
sacrificed
flavor
for
drinkability
i
wouldnt
mind
a
little
sweetness
and
booze
as
long
as
it
had
a
more
robust
flavor
to
follow
it
and
more
dark
fruits
i
love
how
smooth
this
drank
but
hate
how
flavorless
it
is
some
major
tweaking
would
really
help
this
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
you
could
add
more
flavor
to
it
while
keeping
the
alcohol
so
well
hidden
this
beer
really
doesnt
fit
the
style
but
it
still
comes
out
as
the
best
of
the
holiday
pack
for
how
smooth
this
beer
goes
down
for
being
9
5
makes
it
pretty
easy
to
get
drunk
but
the
lack
of
flavor
really
hurts
it
even
though
this
wasnt
a
great
doppelbock
i
am
glad
they
added
it
to
the
holiday
pack
this
is
the
strongest
beer
i
have
ever
seen
in
one
i
havent
been
impressed
with
the
new
beers
i
have
tried
from
atwater
but
they
do
have
a
way
with
hiding
the
booze
this
and
vj
black
are
dangerously
drinkable
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
strong
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
better
ones
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
overall
i
feel
like
a
few
punches
were
pulled
with
this
beer
its
good
enough
to
try
once
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
sourness
is
unexpected
and
makes
this
hard
to
drink
otherwise
its
not
a
bad
dopplebock
i
guess
but
the
flavor
comes
out
of
nowhere
and
is
really
off
for
the
style
maybe
i
got
a
bad
one
pretty
dang
good
over
all
its
an
enjoyable
beer
because
there
isnt
really
anything
that
is
offensive
about
it
just
wish
it
had
a
little
more
doublebock
characteristics
to
it
this
brew
pours
out
as
a
brown
color
with
a
minimal
fizzy
head
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
decent
malt
aroma
with
a
slight
funk
to
it
the
taste
had
this
wierd
sour
flavor
to
it
perhaps
this
had
some
oak
in
it
there
wasnt
much
of
anything
else
besides
some
malt
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
too
bad
some
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
id
like
to
give
this
one
another
try
sometime
it
is
worthy
of
another
round
maybe
they
are
going
for
ultradrinkable
brews
of
varying
styles
for
people
who
dont
actually
like
beer
i
mean
their
imperial
stout
had
the
mouthfeel
of
diet
coke
and
this
is
even
thinner
why
do
people
buy
this
i
could
see
if
it
were
some
little
brewpub
that
focuses
on
food
but
they
bottle
their
beer
and
sell
it
with
statewide
distribution
overall
average
pours
a
two
finger
khaki
head

fades
quickly
leaving

i
really
dont
like
this
one
production
is
marked
for
jan
2011
but
its
9
5
abv
and
it
was
kept
in
pretty
dark
good
conditions
it
wasnt
skunked
im
surpised
they
let
this
one
go
out
its
really
no
good
the
appearance
looked
great
but
then
you
smell
it
and
you
just
cringe
i
normally
like
to
put
food
pairing
with
the
beers
this
one
i
cant
i
would
never
buy
this
one
again
unless
they
revamped
a
new
recipe
i
got
to
hand
it
to
atwater
i
picked
alot
of
things
out
of
this
one
its
just
it
wasnt
all
good
overall
easily
drinkable
and
smooth
the
toasted
levels
of
the
malts
are
great
although
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
bitter
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
ok
beer
not
exactly
what
im
looking
for
in
a
doppelbock
not
one
of
the
finer
examples
of
the
style
lacking
in
some
of
the
traditional
flavor
and
aroma
traits
that
its
peers
possess
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
bit
of
a
reddish
tint
to
it
quite
a
gusher
pretty
big
tan
head
with
a
bit
of
retention
and
a
slight
amount
of
lacing
the
nose
is
pretty
odd
with
some
dark
fruits
and
molasses
plus
a
bit
of
cherry
character
seems
like
this
might
be
unintentional
the
flavor
further
adds
to
this
suspicion
and
im
thinking
this
bottle
might
be
on
the
verge
of
infection
the
cherry
taste
isnt
really
melding
into
the
profile
of
the
beer
and
theres
a
bit
of
a
pucker
factor
beginning
to
form
feel
is
full
of
prickly
carbonation
not
impressed
with
this
one
at
all
thin
watery
mouthfeel
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
for
what
its
worth
it
goes
down
easy
enough
not
easy
enough
to
salvage
the
score
but
well
there
it
is
feel
is
near
flat
oily
almost
syrupy
getting
more
more
difficult
with
each
sip
it
starts
to
turn
my
stomach
give
me
an
ugly
headache
all
at
once
ugh
i
bet
this
is
tolerable
on
draft
though
my
13th
atwater
block
review
was
no
more
lucky
than
the
previous
12
voodoovator
is
definitely
not
recommended
actually
luck
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
brewing
of
good
beer
the
process
is
100
skill
which
is
where
this
outfit
falls
woefully
short
again
and
again
and
again
ad
infinitum
pours
a
dark
brown
somewhat
blackish
color
clear
with
a
towering
white
head
aroma
is
of
slight
roasted
grains
the
flavor
is
enjoyable
strong
base
malt
flavor
with
slight
roasted
grain
taste
reminds
me
of
an
amped
up
schwarzbier
it
doesnt
however
come
close
to
a
doppelbock
the
strong
munich
malt
character
and
warming
alcohol
presence
is
missing
overall
an
ok
beer
but
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
drinkability
is
good
for
9
5
abv
not
an
everyday
beer
this
is
a
big
beer
that
lumberjacks
and
other
burly
types
would
probably
enjoy
with
some
roast
boar
id
say
its
borderline
spoiled
and
the
bacteria
have
been
eating
the
sugar
well
see
whether
riverside
beverage
in
chattanooga
will
give
me
money
back
for
the
four

bottle
no

poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
massive
head
that
looks
like
a
root

luckily
im
not
in
a
big
hurry
to
drink
this
one
this
beer
smells
boozey
aromas
of
molasses
spices
and
caramel
malts
this
beer
tastes
like
liquid
alcoholic
black
licorice
a
bit
too
much
spice
taste
also
i
know
this
beer
is
9
5
abv
but
this
is
one
alcoholic
tasting
doppelbock
i
like
licorice
more
than
most
people
but
i
am
not
really
digging
this
beer
if
you
really
like
sour
ales
give
it
a
shot
otherwise
pass
f
finishes
with
more
of
the
really
bad
flavors
some
bitterness
not
hops
and
syrupy
flavors
also
some
tingly
booze
and
not
so
tasty

is
an
almost
sticky
feel

strong

slight

and

overall
very
sharp
feel
with
an
astringent
quality
good
appearance
but
lacking
in
body
and
aroma
d
nice
somewhat
relaxing
dark
beer
to
sip
on
much
more
reminiscent
of
a
porter
than
a
doppelbock
but
i
guess
the
label
doesnt
lie
d
the
beer
is
moderately
filling
but
is
not
to
difficult
to
drink
considering
its
strength
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
both
the
smell
and
taste
pours
a
deep
warm
sable
with
a
fairly
thick
if
not
persistent
pale
tan
head
aroma
is
not
strong
but
is
malty
and
spicy
and
somewhat
inviting
flavor
is
malty
a
little
spicy
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
still
palatable
texture
is
smooth
a
little
fizzy
just
a
bit
watery
ive
had
better
but
this
is
worth
a
try
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
two
fingers
of
light
tan
head
it
is
brown
with
ruby
highlights
i
get
cherry
and
roasted
barley
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
this
beer
actually
goes
down
great
for
the
abv
i
dont
taste
any
alcohol
at
all
i
dont
think
this
beer
nails
the
style
but
it
has
a
certain
drinkability
d
could
drink
this
all
night
no
real
alcohol
presence
considering
its
9
5
it
started
out
quite
well
but
fell
off
the
wagon
where
it
counts
the
most
for
the
life
of
me
i
cant
figure
out
how
something
so
strong
tastes
so
thin
interesting
label
though
got
me
to
pick
it
up
so
mostly
what
ive
come
up
with
on
this
one
is
what
it
is
not
offensive
but
not
so
much
what
it
is
pretty
good
i
probably
underrated
it
but
it
is
well
balanced
and
does
not
distinguish
itself
in
any
one
category
for
this
low
a
rating
i
would
still
buy
it
again
and
i
wish
i
had
more
it
was
a
bit
pricey
d
not
my
bag
but
i
could
see
people
liking
it
d
very
low

i
had
seen
this
for
a
while
in
the
shelves
and
while
curious
i
had
never
picked
it
up
not
until
i
was
made
a
half
price
offer
to
pick
up
the
4pack
and
try
it
thanks
a
lot
for
the
chance
you
know
who
you
are
im
not
sure
this
is
a
repeat
for
me
although
i
would
not
mind
having
it
again
im
very
grateful
for
the
chance
to
try
it
though
and
would
love
to
try
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
drinkability
is
average
at
best
alcohol
is
hidden
well
but
kinda
flavorless
and
thin
on
the
tongue
for
a
doppelbock
add
some
more
coffee
flavor
and
youd
have
a
decent
black
lager
but
still
something
i
would
pass
on
have
yet
to
try
an
atwater
block
beer
i
like
having
also
tried
the
vanilla
java
porter
but
i
would
try
another
pours
darker
than
anticipated
smells
a
bit
sour
with
coffee
and
cherry
notes
the
taste
is
sour
and
tart
with
a
short
burst
of
rich
maltiness
the
aftertaste
has
hints
of
sour
and
malt
but
almost
imediately
dissipates
and
leaves
me
tasting
metal
an
overall
odd
mix
not
good
when
i
picked
this
up
i
thought
hmm
never
even
heard
of
atwater
block
brewery
guess
i
know
why
with
founders
and
bells
in
their
backyard
they
dont
stand
a
chance
with
a
beer
like
this
i
would
however
try
some
of
their
other
stuff
in
hopes
they
can
do
better
not
terrible
but
im
not
a
fan
and
wont
be
back
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
red
tint
a
large
tan
head
forms
and
has
excellant
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
heavy
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
at
least
it
looks
good
has
a
aroma
like
red
wine
that
has
turned
hints
of
vinegar
and
cough
syrup
the
flavor
is
not
that
impressive
as
well
slightly
sour
with
a
touch
of
vinegar
i
expected
a
malt
bomb
and
was
greated
with
a
slightly
sour
dark
lager
the
malt
just
disappeared
dispite
the
high
abv
alcohol
was
not
detected
the
body
is
average
but
may
be
hurt
more
by
the
flavor
profile
does
not
feel
as
big
as
the
brewer
claims
this
will
be
a
beer
that
i
will
avoid
in
the
future
not
well
made
and
tastes
nothing
of
a
doppelbock
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
who
knows
this
one
just
was
not
doing
it
for
me
d
im
hoping
this
was
a
bad
batch
because
i
really
like
this
style
but
im
wondering
since
i
had
a
bad
experience
with
the
other
atwater
brew
i
had
tried
previously
ill
try
it
again
if
i
see
it
but
im
not
holding
my
breath
im
guessing
karl
just
had
his
too
cold
but
i
would
agree
that
the
head
is
large
pretty
dark
with
ruby
edges
but
when
held
up
to
light
it
was
pretty
clear
obviously
no
hops
but
i
was
expecting
that
some
coffee
a
hint
of
smoke
and
then
overwhelming
sweetness
im
sad
i
drank
all
four
as
i
thought
it
may
get
better
for
me
this
was
quite
unimpressive
12oz
bottle
into
a
dfh
signature
glass
pours
a
dark
almost
opaque
black
that
shows
slight
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
the
beer
is
topped
by
a
thin
diminishing
khaki
head
aroma
is
deep
burnt
caramel
malts
with
hints
of
molasses
and
cocoa
the
taste
is
surprisingly
dominated
by
sweet
fruits
very
off
for
the
style
the
beer
is
somewhat
heavy
with
a
slight
alcohol
presence
i
have
to
wonder
if
this
one
was
just
off
way
more
fruits
than
malt
in
the
sweetness
not
one
ill
bother
with
again
d
this
beer
has
a
smooth
light
flavor
but
a
bit
thin
the
apple
flavor
grows
and
covers
all
other
flavor

very
dark
brown
to
black

masked

it

this
beer
is
a
gusher
seconds
after
opening
the
bottle
it
was
everywhere
it
stopped
once
i
poured
some
into
a
glass
however
it
quickly
filled
the
glass
with
foam
well
before
the
whole
beer
was
poured
it
took
over
ten
minutes
to
fully
pour
this
beer
how
annoying
once
poured
it
is
a
clear
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
huge
and
recedes
slowly
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
burnt
malt
and
a
hint
of
chemicals
it
is
a
very
weak
aroma
for
a
beer
that
claims
to
be
9
5
abv
the
taste
is
more
powerful
than
the
aroma
but
that
isnt
a
good
thing
there
is
more
malt
which
is
nice
but
there
are
more
chemicals
too
which
is
surely
a
very
bad
thing
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
way
to
much
carbonation
for
a
doppelbock
overall
this
is
a
really
bad
beer
that
i
will
never
drink
again
overall
not
bad
at
all
a
very
malty
thick
and
bready
beer
truly
a
meal
in
a
glass
on
tap
at
rfd
in
washington
d
c
dark
beer
whitish
head
minimal
to
low
carbonation
smells
like
roasted
malt
no
real
hop
character
in
the
aroma
also
no
hops
in
flavor
thats
ok
for
a
doppelbock
just
making
a
note
of
it
there
is
some
smoke
more
than
i
expected
high
malt
character
in
flavor
there
is
no
aftertaste
at
all
beer
finishes
completely
very
drinkable
really
like
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
and
great
overall
a
good
beer
thats
heavy
but
just
a
little
too
sweet
if
chilled
very
cold
these
go
down
too
easy
and
that
9
5
abv
could
mean
trouble
i
recommend
trying
this
beer
as
ive
had
a
few
over
the
past
few
weeks
and
thought
it
to
be
enjoyable
as
a
late
night
treat
pours
black
hard
to
see
light
shine
through
nice
thick
tan
head
decent
caramel
aroma
delivery
was
better
than
expected
nice
mellow
and
moderately
carbonated
crisp
feel
fairly
mild
beer
for
its
category
the
label
is
better
than
the
beer
but
would
drink
again
if
offered
drinks
great
as
far
bit
there
is
little
to
no
but
some
may
get
hung
up
on
the
unique
flavor
of
this
doppelbock
pours
a
dark
brown
with
beautiful
mahogany
hues
when
held
to
light
bubbly
beige
head
dissipates
but
impales
the
glass
with
loads
of
lace
smell
is
very
sweet
caramel
brown
sugar
apples
some
alcohol
taste
is
full
of
prunes
brown
sugar
caramel
cherries
and
maybe
apples
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
carbonation
is
medium
body
is
a
little
thinner
that
expected
decent
brew
but
i
think
this
may
not
be
the
freshest
example
of
this
brew
i
wasnt
overwhelmed
with
this
one
not
overly
turned
off
maybe
one
day
when
i
get
a
fresh
pint
at
the
brewery
i
can
revisit
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
loved
it
the
second
time
i
had
it
i
wasnt
able
to
properly
assess
it
third
time
is
a
charm
this
is
a
great
doppelbock
cheers
a
good
beer
and
surprisingly
drinkable
for
the
strength
color
was
dark
brown
carbonation
was
good
smell
was
outstanding
and
the
flavor
was
very
good
i
had
no
idea
until
just
now
what
the
abv
was
on
this
that
explains
the
nap
i
had
to
take
afterwards
mouthfeel
is
creamy
medium
body
flavours
merge
to
a
most
agreeable
finish
including
sour
plum
caramel
nicely
balanced
acidity
carbonation
seemed
low
bitterness
and
sour
fruit
intermingle
a
little
bit
syrupy
at
times
alcohol
very
well
handled
this
is
an
acceptable
middle
of
the
road
doppelbock
thats
well
worth
trying
poured
a
deep
deep
brown
with
a
lrage
dirty
white
head
nose
is
funky
and
faint
with
a
big
grain
smell
not
nice
taste
is
rather
ordinary
nothing
really
stands
out
on
this
one
except
caramel
mouthfeel
is
astringent
and
uneasy
on
the
palete
after
having
a
great
einhorn
doppelbock
this
brew
just
does
not
measure
up
d
there
isnt
really
anything
about
this
beer
that
makes
me
want
to
have
another
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
strong
biting
carbonation
the
carbonation
kills
and
otherwise
good
mouthfeel
nice
slick
half
finger
across
the
surface
of
light
brown
hue
dissolves
at
a
decent
clip
haphazard
lacing
left
behind
more
black
than
brown
in
color
very
dry
and
malty
nose
like
a
bag
of
powdered
chocolate
mocha
cocoa
all
that
shit
lots
of
roast
but
stops
short
of
coffee
bean
oats
and
granola
any
fruit
has
a
pit
or
skin
quality
dried
as
in
not
dried
fruit
you
buy
forest
scrub
or
moss
its
not
tightly
woven
per
se
just
not
expressive
mediumbodied
the
foamy
attack
subsides
through
to
the
midpalate
here
the
roast
is
much
higher
and
does
bring
a
coffee
bean
edge
to
the
dark
chocolate
cocoa
bean
base
has
that
same
unprocessed
grains
feel
dry
and
crunchy
even
plays
well
off
the
round
maltiness
some
black
licorice
too
the
carbonation
might
have
a
touch
more
prickle
to
it
stir
the
flavors
up
some
drinks
smoothly
but
after
half
a
glass
youre
starting
to
lose
interest

of
us
who
enjoy
a

brew
note
looking
at
other
reviews
of
this
beer
after
i
posted
mine
i
do
not
see
any
other
mentions
of
sourness
or
yeastiness
though
one
review
mentioned
a
slight
smell
of
metal
which
could
hint
at
the
same
thing
it
is
possible
the
bottle
i
drank
was
compromised
nothing
about
it
struck
me
as
infected
but
i
will
try
another
bottle
and
see
if
i
think
i
should
revise
my
review
or
not
as
it
stands
though
this
is
easily
one
of
my
least
favorite
doppelbocks
d
moderately
drinkable
i
could
enjoy
1
or
2
in
a
sitting
i
liked
this
beer
considerably
great
addition
to
a
cellar
but
i
would
advise
against
excessive
cellaring
as
it
might
tone
down
the
beer
to
the
point
of
unfortunate
lack
of
character
the
drink
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
subdued
carbonation
and
is
plenty
easy
to
drink
despite
the
abv
taste
was
what
youd
expect
from
a
dopple
caramel
dried
fruit
malt
and
just
enough
hops
to
get
your
attention
after
the
swallow
carbonation
was
light
which
helped
the
very
smooth
mouthfeel
drinkability
despite
the
abv
was
pretty
damn
good
i
could
def
do
more
than
1
or
2
of
these
whether
theyre
worth
the
high
ticket
of
admission
is
another
story
1138
d
hides
the
alcohol
bite
very
well
for
an
almost
10
and
i
couldve
put
back
a
couple
more
of
these
great
warming
beer
edit
lowered
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
scores
a
half
point
i
had
a
few
more
of
these
and
it
is
just
too
thin
the
taste
is
not
bad
but
lacking
anything
special
i
am
also
going
to
say
this
is
not
a
9
5
beer
maybe
it
was
just
the
batch
i
had
but
i
have
had
enough
strong
beer
to
know
what
it
should
taste
and
feel
like
and
this
just
doesnt
have
it
i
wold
be
surprised
if
it
was
over
8
dopplebock
no
more
like
dopplecrock
i
think
im
done
with
this
brewery
d
overall
its
different
and
drinkable
d
i
would
order
another
and
buy
a
sixer
of
this
a
colder
weather
type
of
brew
say
50f
or
colder
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
dark
purple
color
with
a
brownish
head
that
formed
with
an
aggressive
poor
the
aroma
is
clove
some
cherry
and
a
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
a
little
gritty
and
has
some
fruitiness
that
i
was
not
expecting
the
overall
aftertaste
is
of
metal
not
the
greatest
example
of
a
doppelbock
this
ones
about
average
for
me
i
was
hoping
for
more
up
front
in
the
nose
but
given
its
a
doppelbock
theres
not
going
to
be
too
much
there
compared
to
a
stronger
ale
the
slight
sourness
was
a
pleasant
surprised
but
other
than
that
i
was
relatively
ambivalent
about
it
have
this
one
on
its
own
or
with
cheese
but
whatever
you
do
dont
let
it
warm
notes
thought
i
remembered
this
beer
being
a
little
more
rich
the
first
time
i
had
it
seems
like
it
should
be
for
not
just
a
dopplebock
but
also
having
a
high
gravity
you
can
never
tell
the
alcohol
is
there
now
im
thinking
its
kinda
pricey
for
what
you
get
great
beer
though
3
35
overall
expected
a
bit
more
malty
presence
from
this
beer
d
a
very
balanced
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
i
really
liked
this
one
the
look
and
aroma
are
obviously
the
finer
qualities
in
this
brew
i
expect
allot
from
a
doppel
and
i
believe
this
is
a
good
beer
but
its
not
something
ill
purchase
for
myself
i
did
get
this
as
a
gift
and
it
came
in
a
four
pack
ive
set
the
other
three
aside
and
will
cellar
them
for
future
consumption
when
the
time
is
right
ill
crack
another
and
add
notes
to
this
review
taste
kind
of
a
letdown
like
the
smell
the
taste
is
kinda
light
this
is
a
decent
db
not
nearly
a
favorite
it
lacks
in
some
areas
but
worth
trying
pours
brownish
with
light
brown
overflowing
head
smell
is
strong
malty
taste
is
a
bit
harsh
its
fresh
and
carbonation
is
above
average
there
is
strong
malt
and
it
is
boozy
even
a
little
woody
and
corny
not
so
drinkable
medium
mouthfeel
found
at
the
village
beer
merchant
this
week
not
the
worst
doppelbock
ive
had
but
certainly
not
the
best
its
alright
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
does
hide
the
alcohol
quite
well
though
as
one
of
my
first
experiences
with
weizenbocks
i
thought
this
was
rather
enjoyable
despite
having
a
strong
flavor
it
is
easily
more
drinkable
that
some
heavier
beers
with
similar
taste
characteristics
d
a
solid
good
drinking
doublebock
rich
rewarding
and
fit
to
style
and
wont
go
to
waste
a
solid
good
recommend
notes
from
52407
really
really
good
experience
i
generally
dont
like
dbs
because
they
are
too
rich
and
syrupy
but
this
beer
is
refreshingeven
chugalicousnot
gooey
goes
down
like
a
bock
or
dunkel
id
love
to
be
able
to
get
this
on
tap
goes
great
with
a
meal
d
i
love
me
some
dbs
and
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
very
pleasant
and
warming
beverage
well
done
well
it
misses
the
mark
compared
to
the
classics
of
the
style
by
a
mile
or
three
although
enough
is
there
to
go
in
that
direction
out
of
style
or
different
interpretation
of
the
style
well
even
there
nothing
special
not
too
fond
of
the
sourness
that
doesnt
blend
particularly
well
still
it
has
something
to
make
the
oddness
not
bad
the
alcohol
is
reasonably
wellcovered
finishing
one
is
fine
but
wouldnt
get
this
one
again
drinkability
soso
at
best
this
one
needs
to
be
a
thicker
in
body
and
mellow
the
alcohol
a
bit
for
a
more
drinkable
beer
one
thing
i
really
liked
about
this
beer
was
that
despite
the
hefty
9
5
abv
it
went
down
pretty
easily
and
hardly
any
alcohol
was
detected
kudos
on
the
drinkability
yet
the
overall
taste
definitely
couldve
been
richer
and
thicker
overall
starts
off
nicely
but
slowly
fizzles
out
near
the
end
regardless
give
it
a
try
my
1st
from
atwater
and
decent
enough
my
first
from
atwater
the
voodoovator
pours
a
semi
transparent
brown
color
with
ruby
red
highlights
an
a
small
off
white
head
sweet
and
nutty
roasted
grains
in
the
nose
smokey
and
sweet
to
the
tongue
lots
of
woodyearthy
tones
and
chocolate
malt
cherry
and
baked
banana
flavors
no
hop
character
or
spice
to
speak
of
no
booze
either
medium
bodied
and
pretty
damn
drinkable
drinkability
i
thought
i
was
going
to
love
this
beer
i
didnt
dig
the
sourness
at
the
end
it
was
hard
to
finish
off
the
beer
if
you
lilke
sour
beers
porters
and
stouts
you
like
this
a
lot
what
a
weird
dopplebock
either
contaminated
or
i
have
no
idea
what
they
were
going
for
here
the
alcolhol
is
hidden
but
this
is
a
sipper
very
sweet
temp
45
degrees
d
its
a
good
drinker
the
deceptive
strength
can
really
sneak
up
on
you
if
youre
not
careful
drinakbility
i
like
pleasantly
sour
doppelbocks
but
this
one
needs
to
lower
the
tart
and
sour
flavors
and
increase
the
roasted
flavors
a
little
bit
more
dark
roasted
flavor
should
do
this
beer
some
justice
would
i
drink
this
beer
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
sour
berry
doppelbock
i
most
certainly
would
im
a
dopplebock
fan
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
is
missing
that
rich
chewy
malty
body
that
makes
a
dopplebock
what
it
is
dont
know
about
this
one
nicely
drinkable
but
has
some
serious
flaws
served
in
a
flute
pour
was
a
gusher
glass
was
80
rocky
tancolored
foam
that
continued
to
ooze
forth
from
the
bottle
during
the
tasting
brew
was
a
fairly
translucent
brown
with
ruby
red
highlights
when
backlit
lots
of
sticky
lacing
present
on
this
one
nose
was
malt
brown
sugar
towards
the
back
and
toffeecaramel
in
the
middle
taste
consistent
with
nose
but
a
chocolatey
character
dominates
mouthfeel
is
what
ruined
this
beer
for
me
somewhere
between
light
and
medium
bodied
but
way
too
much
carbonation
made
it
difficult
to
drink
drinkability
was
greatly
compromised
by
the
overcarbonation
on
this
brew
however
alcohol
was
very
wellhidden
for
the
abv
might
need
to
revisit
this
one
again
in
hopes
that
it
was
just
a
bad
bottle
quite
tasty
d
an
excellent
doppelboack
a
high
abv
limits
how
many
i
would
have
but
if
you
enjoy
this
style
this
is
a
great
beer
drinkability
though
my
exposure
to
atwater
has
been
limited
this
is
my
favorite
so
far
d
really
weird
beer
kind
of
good
but
kind
of
weird
i
would
not
seek
this
out
actively
again
nice
dark
burgandy
tone
thin
light
brown
head
sporadic
patches
of
lace
are
created
on
the
walls
of
the
glass
as
i
drink
aromas
malty
and
rummy
not
particularily
strong
for
a
dopple
though
this
is
a
solid
tasting
dopple
bordering
on
very
good
it
just
doesnt
have
the
richness
and
complexity
to
be
called
great
but
its
good
nice
malty
tones
with
breadiness
resembling
bread
pudding
create
the
base
alcohol
is
hidden
very
nicely
hard
to
believe
were
looking
at
close
to
10
here
nicely
carbonated
and
medium
to
mediumfull
in
body
nice
drinking
dopple
and
quite
enjoyable
picked
up
a
single
even
though
its
not
really
doppelbock
season
this
wasnt
bad
just
kind
of
weird
tasting
kind
of
artificialsweetener
tasting
at
times
overall
impression
a
big
malty
slightly
sour
lager
the
sourness
is
suprising
im
wondering
if
its
the
combination
of
2
crystal
malts
and
munich
in
the
grist
per
the
website
it
didnt
seem
sour
like
it
was
infected
but
i
just
kept
getting
those
sour
cherry
notes
which
makes
me
think
it
was
malt
and
yeast
driven
big
and
interesting
but
not
sure
ill
revisit
d
very
highly
drinkable
for
something
this
strong
id
have
another
one
but
id
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
notes
this
beer
didnt
set
well
with
me
it
needs
a
second
go
it
was
like
a
soda
that
fermented
the
definitive
beer
fail
this
is
a
rich
beer
with
an
impressive
appearance
with
an
apv
just
shy
of
10
this
is
a
beer
with
which
to
finish
the
day
after
finishing
1
bottle
from
the
4pack
i
was
happy
to
give
away
the
remaining
3
to
friends
who
wanted
to
try
it
drinkability
easy
to
drink
with
no
hints
of
the
9
5
abv
but
still
a
fairly
flavorless
brew
had
someone
given
me
a
few
chances
to
name
the
style
blind
i
may
have
said
stout
porter
or
esb
maybe
some
others
but
doppelbock
no
way
glad
i
didnt
buy
a
4pack
and
only
got
a
bottle
sample
at
gallos
taproom
in
columbus
pours
dark
brown
with
red
around
the
edges
thin
and
creamy
beige
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
spotty
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
dark
fruit
mediumbodied
with
flavors
of
caramel
malt
and
toasted
nuts
plus
some
hops
abv
is
wellmasked
the
finish
is
mildly
roasty
with
a
grainy
malt
aftertaste
just
average
overall
thanks
to
kkulacki
for
the
gift
pours
unceremoniously
short
lived
head
overly
carbonated
look
brownish
red
sweet
and
tinny
odor
some
chocolate
and
toffee
smell
too
tastes
malty
and
a
little
bit
like
fake
cherry
juice
with
a
metallic
note
to
it
too
maltiness
is
sweet
and
slightly
astringent
on
the
finish
an
unbalanced
kind
of
weird
dopplebock
that
doesnt
impress
me
too
much
m
d
the
alcohol
does
end
up
being
quite
well
hidden
in
this
one
aside
from
a
pleasant
warming
down
the
throat
a
bit
of
a
foaminess
in
the
mouth
that
is
decent
i
almost
would
have
preferred
a
little
more
creaminess
to
it
but
its
nothing
ill
lose
sleep
over
a
decent
take
on
it
but
not
the
most
memorable
i
suppose
pours
an
extremely
dark
brown
color
almost
block
with
a
thin
lace
of
head
smell
is
almost
all
liquor
with
slight
a
malty
aroma
to
it
taste
is
very
malty
but
surprisingly
fruity
too
and
with
minimally
bitterness
goes
down
smooth
moderately
carbonated
i
expected
more
from
this
one
especially
from
a
doppelbock
not
a
much
to
get
excited
about
nicely
done
not
my
thing
for
this
style
too
much
bitterness
for
a
dopplebock
not
enough
malt
and
associated
character
mouthfeel
seems
wrong
last
swigs
worth
a
shot
for
the
curious
but
nothing
to
brag
about
lacks
the
full
flavor
punch
maybe
we
are
spoiled
in
the
se
pa
land
of
milk
and
honey
and
dopelbocks
like
slyfox
and
victory
taste
was
strange
to
me
i
could
taste
the
sweet
malts
that
were
dark
but
not
very
roasted
in
flavor
it
has
a
sort
of
bready
belgian
flavor
mid
palate
that
seems
off
to
me
for
this
style
of
beer
it
finishes
with
a
touch
of
hop
flavor
to
cut
the
sweet
there
is
virtually
no
alcohol
presence
in
this
beer
which
is
listed
at
9
5
i
believe
i
have
had
this
in
my
dbf
for
about
4
months
which
could
contribute
to
the
lack
of
alcohol
taste
or
burn
but
all
of
it
gone
that
alone
makes
the
drinkability
good
i
am
not
sure
i
would
pick
this
up
again
if
i
saw
it
but
not
a
bad
offering
if
someone
handed
it
to
me
clear
deep
copperyamber
nice
creamy
beige
head
with
good
lacing
quality
smells
sweet
with
caramel
malts
and
the
lighter
of
the
dark
fruits
light
herbal
tealike
hops
blend
nicely
with
the
sweetness
a
medium
body
is
lifted
by
a
good
amount
of
fine
carbonation
the
flavor
mimics
the
nose
in
both
ingredients
and
lightness
it
is
pleasant
while
not
complex
and
drinks
much
lighter
than
the
abv
suggests
overall
i
am
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
but
this
one
won
my
heart
from
the
first
sip
tons
of
bold
flavors
which
struck
me
just
right
i
am
beginnig
to
beleive
that
the
hop
devil
dont
serve
a
bad
beer
and
i
have
yet
to
start
my
kuhnhenn
reviews
great
to
sip
though
surprisingly
drinkable
considering
the
9
5
alcohol
easily
my
favorite
of
the
atwater
beers
its
fun
to
play
in
but
not
all
that
i
was
hoping
for
just
a
good
dopplebock
worth
checking
out
d
this
is
a
very
good
dopplebock
with
a
powerful
abv
9
5
my
first
atwater
block
beer
i
hope
all
the
others
are
this
good
d
easy
no
carbonation
a
good
waffle
beer
d
definitely
a
desert
beer
one
and
done
drinkability
is
surprisingly
high
for
the
alcohol
content
it
drinks
very
smooth
however
it
was
much
lighter
than
i
was
hoping
for
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
warm
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
caramel
and
roasted
malts
its
got
a
patent
malt
earthiness
to
it
as
well
the
taste
is
good
also
it
has
a
smooth
roasted
and
black
malt
taste
its
dry
with
bit
of
burnt
toffee
sweetness
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
with
just
a
bit
of
warmth
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
its
got
a
complex
malt
bill
and
is
full
flavored
pours
darkbrown
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
comes
off
syrupy
and
sweet
with
caramel
malt
im
tasting
apple
right
off
the
bat
but
its
not
really
an
overwhelming
taste
it
is
surprisingly
fruity
as
im
also
getting
red
grape
and
dates
along
with
the
cocoa
and
roasted
malt
this
beer
seems
to
be
missing
the
big
munich
and
licorice
malt
flavors
its
not
bad
but
not
quite
par
for
the
style
it
also
feels
highly
carbonated
at
the
first
sips
with
fine
bubbles
but
is
also
well
balanced
to
make
it
drinkable
id
call
this
worth
a
try
if
you
want
a
different
sort
of
doppelbock
the
dark
mahoganny
color
was
nice
with
a
fluffy
head
smell
was
alcohol
and
burnt
malt
the
taste
was
swett
but
not
overpowering
with
a
nice
coffee
lihht
finish
this
is
the
smoothest
beer
i
have
ever
drank
that
had
this
much
alcohol
it
also
had
a
slight
peppermint
hit
to
it
it
is
a
real
winner
i
will
buyy
again
pours
a
very
dark
brown
that
looks
cloudy
small
tannish
head
that
keeps
with
a
small
film
of
head
mild
sugar
on
there
smells
like
the
candy
they
make
bracelets
out
of
that
you
bite
pieces
off
then
there
is
some
wood
on
there
too
then
there
is
some
minor
caramel
notes
all
of
it
adds
up
to
very
little
really
flavor
is
okay
smooth
yes
full
of
character
no
sweetness
rises
up
several
seconds
in
and
really
sings
on
the
tongue
for
a
bit
before
it
dies
down
just
not
much
else
going
on
really
nothing
interesting
feel
has
a
good
carbonation
and
the
liquid
is
good
but
overall
this
is
one
not
exciting
dopplebock
even
the
9
5
alcohol
doesnt
really
mean
much
when
i
dont
feel
motivated
to
finish
it
i
just
didnt
get
a
lot
of
enjoyment
out
of
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
bad
either
i
bought
this
as
a
12oz
single
from
brewbrew
in
north
ridgeville
oh
the
bottom
line
atwater
block
provides
a
serviceable
though
not
spectacular
take
on
the
doppelbock
style
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
a
pint
of
this
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
doppelbock
and
it
was
the
only
one
available
but
vis
a
vis
the
other
options
out
there
it
is
only
soso
d
very
tasty
and
dangerously
drinkable
i
hope
theres
more
left
at
the
store
the
aroma
is
dominated
primarily
by
caramel
along
with
some
malt
and
molasses
it
is
pretty
sweet
dominated
by
a
darkfruit
almost
cherry
characteristic
theres
really
not
much
going
on
apart
from
this
except
for
a
mild
alcoholic
burn
on
the
finish
it
seems
to
be
lacking
the
weight
that
a
doppel
should
have
it
mainly
a
sugary
syrupy
front
with
no
complexity
or
anchor
on
the
finish
not
very
impressed
maple
syrup
color
nose
of
caramel
and
nutty
sweet
breads
slightly
sweet
malty
flavor
of
caramel
nuts
and
toffee
finished
drier
than
it
started
which
boosted
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
with
some
surprise
as
i
confess
a
bias
towards
atwater
due
to
previous
experiences
with
other
beers
very
well
done
for
an
american
doppelbock
drinkability
i
suppose
it
is
quite
drinkable
considering
that
it
is
so
light
and
watery
at
9
5
it
could
sneak
up
on
someone
having
many
but
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
i
wouldnt
be
reordering
right
away
pours
black
with
a
tan
head
aromas
of
a
sweet
malty
caramel
chariteristics
in
the
taste
sweet
with
a
small
presence
of
coffee
and
chocolate
a
smooth
yet
malty
mouthfeel
and
a
malty
small
chocolate
aftertaste
hides
the
9
5
well
but
not
really
fantastic
i
thought
it
was
more
stoutish
than
a
doppelbock
and
yet
a
bit
watery
the
mouthfeel
could
be
a
little
thicker
but
the
carbonation
is
pretty
good
the
abv
isnt
too
noticeable
but
neither
is
the
beer
d
this
ended
up
going
down
at
a
pretty
decent
clip
for
how
much
alcohol
there
is
in
this
it
is
fairly
well
hidden
there
are
better
doppelbocks
out
there
but
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
worth
a
try
the
drinkability
is
great
i
like
this
beer
and
am
glad
i
have
3
more
prosit
und
zum
wohl
mk
flavor
is
very
malt
heavy
as
well
i
get
brown
sugar
and
molasses
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
too
some
warm
alcohol
comes
through
on
the
finish
fairly
drinkable
even
with
the
mild
heat
no
hops
on
this
brew
pretty
nice
beer
but
could
be
a
little
sneaky
with
the
hidden
9
5
pleasantly
surprised
as
my
tastings
of
atwater
brews
over
the
years
havent
been
very
pleasing
this
is
one
of
the
better
attempts
ive
seen
at
the
style
for
michigan
not
up
to
par
with
the
germans
atwater
has
some
refining
to
do
for
this
brew
but
it
has
promise
md
very
enjoyable
beer
nothing
too
crazy
good
but
somethign
i
could
easily
enjoy
again
this
beer
got
better
as
it
warmed
up
in
the
glass
and
was
a
fine
all
around
beer
its
big
at
9
5
abv
but
the
brewers
did
a
fine
job
masking
the
high
alcohol
content
id
be
happy
to
revisit
this
one
once
the
weather
starts
to
cool
off
a
bit
this
beer
just
simply
doesnt
have
much
going
on
with
it
and
almost
tastes
like
its
a
little
infected
sour
notes
rivaling
that
of
a
jolly
pumpkin
brew
the
only
real
flavors
are
burnt
caramel
and
chocolate
squares
of
different
variety
mouth
is
a
bit
creamy
but
there
is
no
finish
to
help
this
stand
up
and
out
very
dissapointed
after
sampling
there
dunkel
which
i
found
to
be
very
sessionable
i
remember
trying
to
figure
out
why
this
beer
was
a
couple
dollars
more
than
the
rest
of
the
fatheads
take
out
selection
and
always
had
a
hard
time
figuring
out
why
after
trying
it
out
besides
the
higher
alcohol
im
not
sure
why
the
price
mark
up
happened
but
this
brew
appears
a
very
dark
ruby
brown
tone
with
alarge
tan
head
formin
thick
and
leaves
behind
even
streaks
of
lacing
aroma
has
a
roasty
cocoa
powder
a
bit
muted
or
even
dumbed
down
with
mild
fruit
raisin
and
other
dried
fruits
soaked
in
alcohol
with
a
minimal
herbal
hop
nose
flavor
is
sweet
and
roasty
in
the
malt
department
provides
some
cocoa
powder
and
mild
fruitiness
the
alcohol
is
actually
hidden
pretty
well
in
the
taste
with
a
touch
of
caramel
but
overall
im
not
getting
a
real
authentic
doppelbock
feel
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
harsher
kinda
abrasive
carbonation
touch
of
a
sticky
texture
that
tends
to
cling
onto
the
palate
drinkability
is
decent
but
im
overall
underimpressed
and
another
factor
in
this
beer
is
the
need
to
watchout
for
the
hidden
alcohol
taste
starts
out
with
smooth
milk
chocolatey
sweet
malts
scorched
sugar
babies
and
candied
cooked
vegetables
follow
slightly
meaty
and
tobaccoy
sweetness
stays
throughout
with
mildly
bitter
noble
hops
in
the
finish
not
bad
a
fairly
straightforward
example
of
the
style
without
a
ton
of
complexity
mediumbodied
with
a
very
creamy
feel
a
tad
thinner
than
i
like
very
smooth
and
the
9
5
abv
hides
itself
very
well
overall
a
very
good
beer
if
you
like
big
lagers
this
ones
for
you
12oz
bottle
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
that
didnt
leave
lace
as
it
quickly
dissipated
into
just
a
slight
film
over
the
top
of
the
beer
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
a
very
faint
caramel
malt
and
no
noticeable
smell
of
alcohol
for
a
9
5
taste
and
feel
seems
a
bit
watery
at
first
with
some
slightly
darker
fruit
malt
flavors
like
plums
and
raisins
this
brew
seems
to
lack
in
the
flavor
department
but
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
well
hidden
abv
that
im
sure
would
sneak
up
on
you
if
your
not
careful
mahogany
in
color
with
some
ruby
highlights
off
white
head
holds
well
for
a
few
minutes
then
fades
lightly
roasty
toffee
and
fruitcake
aroma
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
but
does
not
have
the
depth
of
the
classics
very
smooth
sweetness
in
the
beginning
medium
body
with
lower
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
decent
brew
but
not
at
the
top
a
welcome
break
from
most
bastardized
american
versions
of
such
a
classy
brew
voodovator
at
least
measures
up
to
the
style
pretty
well
a
muted
aroma
or
syruy
malts
fruitcake
caramel
and
rum
promises
rich
flavors
and
good
drinkability
the
flavors
closely
mimic
the
aromas
following
up
with
a
light
peatmoss
smokiness
and
complex
dark
dehydrated
fruits
dates
figs
and
solid
toastiness
the
feel
is
sweet
but
not
heavy
the
alcohols
are
well
hidden
but
warming
and
sweet
the
finish
gets
a
little
cola
like
in
its
sweetness
and
tackiness
falling
back
on
its
darker
color
overall
a
very
solid
brew
but
lacks
the
punch
to
be
considered
great
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
doppel
dangerous
at

5abv
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
slightly
smaller
body
than
i
expected
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
not
a
bad
beer
certainly
worth
a
try
there
are
no
off
flavors
but
nothing
to
make
this
one
really
great
either
very
balanced
and
i
found
the
woody
nutty
flavors
interesting
drinkability
i
rather
liked
drinking
this
beer
though
it
lacked
complexity
in
the
flavor
it
was
overall
very
enjoyable
i
would
have
this
one
again
nice
on
a
very
cold
winter
night
sweetish
malts
and
molasses
in
the
aroma
which
as
stated
did
not
follow
through
quite
enough
in
the
taste
nice
lil
sour
ale
aspect
in
the
finish
along
with
an
pop
of
alcohol
as
the
brew
warmed
a
decent
drinker
nice
winter
brew
this
is
a
ver
good
beer
very
smooth
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
thanks
vancer
this
one
has
a
nice
label
it
pours
a
very
dark
color
with
a
tall
head
that
falls
slowly
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
malty
and
sweet
with
some
hints
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
plenty
of
malts
are
upfront
with
the
sweetness
and
there
isnt
much
hop
character
to
be
found
there
is
a
hint
of
astringency
that
comes
across
the
top
but
doesnt
take
much
away
the
alcohol
is
hidden
extremely
well
the
body
is
moderate
surprisingly
i
expected
it
to
be
thicker
than
it
is
the
drinkability
is
very
good
for
the
level
of
alcohol
i
poured
this
twelve
ounce
bottle
into
a
glass
beer
mug
it
is
dark
with
a
tan
head
both
in
smell
and
taste
it
is
very
carmely
nice
slight
hint
of
hops
to
dry
the
end
very
malty
and
sweet
and
i
like
that
in
a
beer
the
alcohol
is
certianly
there
yet
the
beer
is
very
smooth
i
plan
on
buying
more
so
i
can
share
it
with
a
buddy
pours
a
deep
brownish
red
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
reasonable
head
aroma
is
mostly
minerally
i
would
like
a
slight
hint
of
noble
hops
or
malt
in
the
smell
taste
is
appropriate
munich
malty
goodness
mouthfeel
is
thin
for
the
style
very
drinkable
though
not
to
shabby
of
a
beer
has
intersting
logo
this
is
the
second
of
a
atwater
block
brewing
beer
that
i
have
had
and
both
so
far
have
been
alright
this
one
is
nothing
to
brag
about
but
worth
the
try
very
very
nice
dark
lager
i
like
very
much
overall
not
a
bad
winterbock
i
did
enjoy
this
on
draft
at
the
va
beach
gb
abv
is
reported
at
7
5
great
with
the
gb
garlic
fries
taste
is
again
very
much
a
roasty
malty
semisweet
melding
of
dark
malts
with
a
chewy
caramel
or
toffee
character
dominating
theres
also
an
element
of
nuttiness
in
the
flavor
which
is
perfect
for
a
chilly
snow
day
this
is
everything
a
solid
doppelbock
should
be
the
body
seems
a
tad
light
but
the
flavor
does
not
suffer
a
solid
drinking
bock
and
at
a
strong
7
5
this
is
a
deceptively
enjoyable
brew
bravo
i
had
this
back
in
early
december
in
san
diego
and
didnt
take
notes
the
thing
i
remember
most
is
that
it
tasted
very
similar
to
sam
adams
winter
lager
to
me
with
a
slightly
fuller
body
overall
very
good
taste
and
mouthfeel
very
enjoyable
for
an
everyday
doppelbock
on
tap
at
the
dc
location
near
the
verizon
center
pours
a
dark
brown
with
plenty
of
light
showing
through
and
a
small
brownish
white
head
aroma
of
some
light
roast
and
molasses
sweetness
but
not
much
else
flavor
follows
with
watery
sweet
malts
a
hint
of
roast
some
dirty
lager
finish
then
leaving
some
surprising
sweet
citrus
on
the
palate
light
to
medium
bodied
not
super
crisp
but
goes
down
easy
enough
with
adequate
carbonation
overall
not
exciting
but
not
terrible
overall
a
very
enjoyable
doppelbock
with
tons
and
nice
smooth
flavors
but
yet
maintaining
a
nice
easy
drinking
feel
the
verdict
not
bad
a
decent
representative
of
the
style
its
fairly
tasty
and
goes
down
smooth
nothing
to
make
it
stand
out
but
nothing
to
complain
about
overall
its
a
good
beer
and
being
a
7
5
abv
it
will
kick
your
booty
if
you
try
and
session
with
this
this
beer
came
in
a
variety
pack
for
10
99
that
alone
makes
it
well
worth
the
buy
i
will
buy
again
but
not
because
its
the
best
tasting
beer
rather
its
one
of
the
best
deals
out
there
o
a
relatively
big
dopplebock
in
terms
of
flavor
worthy
of
the
bavarian
references
o
this
one
hides
the
alcohol
quite
well
but
i
was
looking
for
more
of
a
malt
profile
that
is
typical
of
a
doppelbock
overall
pretty
good
though
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
total
wine
in
tucson
i
have
a
confession
to
make
i
am
friends
with
the
brewer
at
one
location
and
i
got
to
try
this
before
is
was
released
to
the
public
it
was
about
two
weeks
away
from
general
tapping
but
the
beer
was
more
than
ready
in
the
horizontal
lagering
tank
in
the
cold
room
he
poured
me
a
mug
and
i
had
to
drink
it
the
beer
was
sensational
straight
up
he
was
worried
about
the
abv
and
about
the
hops
in
the
finish
thought
a
few
more
weeks
would
make
it
more
acceptable
to
the
masses
but
i
am
not
the
masses
it
was
creamy
and
rich
brown
sugar
in
color
with
a
two
inch
khaki
colored
head
that
did
not
recede
at
all
the
smell
was
caramunich
and
carared
malts
which
affect
the
color
as
well
as
the
nose
giving
it
a
sweet
doughnutty
aroma
flavor
is
true
to
that
at
first
but
a
surprising
hop
kick
comes
in
with
a
little
wintery
spice
mix
in
the
finish
to
crisp
it
up
this
is
what
any
winter
lager
should
taste
like
i
hate
to
give
this
much
props
to
a
chain
but
this
is
a
brilliant
holiday
offering
better
than
most
craft
stuff
on
the
market
the
freshness
of
the
hops
might
have
made
this
for
me
sort
of
english
barleywiney
in
ways
but
german
malty
its
special
and
i
hope
its
just
as
good
in
other
mediums
but
somehow
i
am
doubting
that
it
could
be
for
now
though
suffice
it
to
say
that
tis
beer
is
a
wonderful
thing
heavy
and
light
at
the
same
time
in
feel
with
a
full
body
sticky
like
honey
but
like
a
memory
foam
pillow
in
the
finish
in
the
sense
that
it
fits
your
shape
and
rlaxes
you
slowly
this
beer
was
top
notch
and
i
wish
that
everyone
could
try
it
as
i
did
tonight
the
flavors
decent
nice
bits
of
caramel
and
bread
finishes
clean
and
keeps
the
brew
drinkable
as
doppelbocks
go
its
not
as
intense
as
im
used
to
or
prefer
but
i
might
pick
this
up
occasionally
were
i
at
the
brewpub
in
wintertime
found
this
in
maui
in
a
mixed
winter
12
pack
was
very
impressed
with
the
rich
malty
flavours
that
came
out
in
this
beer
the
balance
is
good
with
the
sweetness
being
balanced
with
a
dryish
finish
i
also
thought
the
mouthfeel
was
just
right
and
looked
forward
to
a
second
bottle
if
youre
in
san
diego
the
one
in
mission
valley
has
and
excellent
brewer
by
the
name
of
doug
hasker
give
him
your
regards
as
you
sample
his
fine
craft
o
glad
i
found
this
on
tap
at
the
gb
restaurant
at
raleigh
durham
airport
very
enjoyable
d
looks
good
smells
pretty
good
tastes
pretty
good
and
mouth
feel
is
good
not
a
bad
little
beer
at
7
5
abv
this
is
one
or
two
beer
session
for
me
not
a
bad
little
brew
from
gordon
this
was
a
decent
beer
nothing
really
stands
out
it
was
good
once
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
that
i
will
definetely
keep
in
my
collection
i
havent
had
many
bocks
before
but
if
this
is
standard
for
the
type
consider
me
a
fan
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
moderate
bitterness
and
caramel
and
raisin
bread
theres
plenty
of
hop
flavor
lending
an
earthy
flavorful
backbone
to
this
beer
the
palate
has
too
much
of
the
caramel
and
dark
caramel
malt
character
without
the
bready
flavors
that
youd
get
from
the
better
german
brewed
versions
toffee
dark
fruit
caramel
and
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
are
all
present
along
with
a
mild
spicy
note
especially
on
the
finish
medium
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
a
little
too
much
this
beer
is
pretty
solid
and
quite
enjoyable
appearance
is
a
dark
copper
in
color
supporting
a
thick
head
leaving
nice
layered
lace
smell
of
big
upfront
malt
and
sweet
dark
fruits
taste
comes
through
as
in
the
aroma
with
a
malt
sweetness
and
moderate
alchohol
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
nothing
complex
thats
mildly
rough
around
the
edges
but
definately
warming
o
very
impressed
with
this
beer
a
full
flavored
winter
beer
that
is
easy
drinking
received
a
gordon
biersch
sampler
for
christmas
and
really
enjoyed
34
beers
including
this
one
o
pretty
good
winter
bock
style
i
guess
my
first
style
like
this
but
german
style
beer
is
not
really
my
thing
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
several
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
o
a
worthy
example
of
a
holiday
winter
warmer
or
dopplebock
in
some
aspects
better
than
spaten
optimator
on
tap
which
i
use
as
my
reference
for
this
variety
a
decent
beer
but
a
little
late
in
the
overall
taste
would
like
it
slightly
darker
o
very
nice
and
enjoyable
bock
abv
is
hidden
well
and
almost
not
noticed
i
would
recommend
to
try
it
if
you
get
an
opportunity
shrug
a
pleasant
enough
beer
but
nothing
so
exciting
that
id
probably
want
to
ever
order
it
again
d
easily
drinkable
flavorful
smooth
and
balanced
d
all
in
all
its
a
good
beer
could
be
a
little
more
balanced
with
a
more
rounded
flavor
but
still
a
decent
choice
still
gives
you
a
warm
feeling
on
the
colder
winter
nights
on
tap
from
gb
in
washington
dc
poured
into
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
decent
head
that
left
a
nice
layer
of
foam
but
little
lacing
pleasantly
sweet
aroma
of
malts
with
some
caramel
flavors
were
stronger
and
also
had
some
dark
cherries
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
smooth
just
a
bit
creamy
fairly
fullbodied
one
finger
slowly
developing
light
tan
quick
dissipation
with
no

clear

some

with
a
significant
amount
of
sweetness
medium
crystal
with
medium
cherryish
esters
floral
hops
in
the
nose
taste
mirrors
the
nose
a
bit
too
sweet
for
style
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
for
style
a
wee
bit
of
effervescence
drinkability
is
ok
but
the
cloying
sweetness
in
absence
of
roast
character
was
a
bit
befuddling
had
this
at
gb
bolingbrook
il
pours
a
dark
ruby
not
opaque
with
minimal
tan
head
no
lacing
at
all
down
the
glass
no
discernable
aroma
just
a
malty
sweet
smell
tastes
very
smooth
almost
sweet
malty
no
hops
detected
mouthfeel
again
is
very
smooth
and
easy
going
down
little
carbonation
feel
not
a
session
beer
as
this
made
me
a
little
giddy
after
just
one
but
is
a
great
winter
warmup
if
you
plan
to
stay
awhile
and
let
someone
else
drive
you
home
would
drink
again
a
total
comfort
beer
that
ill
gladly
pick
up
anytime
im
wanting
a
flavorful
and
reasonablypriced
american
version
of
this
greatest
of
german
beer
styles
great
drinkability
although
high
in
alcohol
content
though
sampled
at
gordon
biersch
restaurant
in
dallas
tx
pours
hazyamber
hue
with
a
slight
tan
head
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
and
some
cherry
body
is
medium
smooth
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malt
and
cherry
fruit
short
malty
finish
this
brew
is
too
sweet
for
me
overall
an
ok
beer
but
it
needs
more
balance
they
should
use
more
dry
malts
and
less
sweet
malt
i
guess
the
beer
would
be
good
if
you
have
a
sweet
tooth
but
i
do
not
though
at
the
same
time
i
know
that
the
style
this
beer
is
tends
to
be
sweet
the
beer
does
have
some
nice
qualities
to
it
overall
this
is
a
slightly
less
than
average
take
on
the
double
bock
style
though
d
nice
and
easy
drinking
could
have
several
of
these
great
beer
for
a
relaxing
session
d
im
not
a
big
fan
of
sweet
brews
but
this
was
a
very
drinkable
delicious
brew
ive
had
many
gb
brews
at
their
brewpub
on
f
street
in
dc
and
though
not
always
overwhelmed
im
always
pleased
gb
winter
bock
is
no
less
pleasing
a
nice
change
of
pace
a
decent
pick
for
the
winter
clean
and
not
spiced
not
anything
off
the
wall
its
focus
set
on
the
style
enjoyable
drinkability
is
solid
defintely
not
the
best
dopplebock
ive
had
but
surely
not
the
worse
good
enough
to
revisit
each
winter
overall
visit
gordon
biersch
and
try
this
drinkability
very
decent
brew
filling
but
not
quite
as
filling
as
it
could
be
pours
a
dark
clear
brown
big
light
tan
head
smell
is
mild
roasted
malt
with
some
chocolate
notes
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
big
chocolate
flavor
very
nice
full
bodied
mouthfeel
creamy
very
easily
drinkable
i
really
like
this
one
overall
great
for
a
nongerman
doppelbock
and
a
very
nice
winter
seasonal
d
i
can
imagine
that
this
is
quite
tasty
when
fresh
i
got
this
as
part
of
a
winter
sampler
pack
and
i
think
that
the
bottle
went
bad
i
would
buy
this
again
fresh
when
it
comes
back
in
season
easy
drinker
after
walking
dc
on
a
28
degree
day
a
very
pleasant
dark
lager
i
wish
it
had
hit
the
market
here
before
winter
is
nearly
over
arriving
just
a
few
short
weeks
ago
however
it
is
a
nice
way
to
toast
the
last
few
remaining
days
of
the
season
ive
been
pleasantly
surprised
by
other
gordon
biersch
beers
and
winterbock
is
no
exception
being
a
solid
pleasant
strong
dark
lager
that
i
will
look
for
again
next
year
drinkability
is
good
no
big
alcohol
presence
not
too
sweet
good
sipper
could
have
had
another
pours
an
opaque
chocolaty
brown
with
a
finebubbled
offwhite
head
rich
aroma
is
malty
spicy
and
just
a
little
chocolaty
flavor
is
mainly
malty
with
a
spicy
undertone
that
is
mostly
cloves
and
cinnamon
texture
is
pleasant
smooth
and
fizzy
going
down
nicely
mouthfeel
medium
to
full
body
a
little
light
on
the
carbonation
but
not
in
a
negative
way
d
this
is
a
flavorful
dopplebock
with
lots
of
malt
character
the
dark
flavors
are
a
nice
combination
of
caramel
and
subtle
fruit
though
they
do
also
include
some
light
roasted
notes
that
technically
shouldnt
be
there
overall
a
nice
beer
that
fits
the
season
well
carbonation
was
low
with
a
light
mouthfeel
and
a
slight
bitterness
at
end
a
good
and
light
but
with
a
bite
of
bitterness
and
a
smooth
aftertaste
and
finish
drinkability
not
a
bad
lil
doppelbock
though
it
starts
to
kind
of
fall
apart
as
it
warms
seeming
ever
more
alcoholic
so
dont
dillydally
while
drinking
this
one
ive
been
slowly
respectfully
working
through
the
recent
influx
of
gordon
bierschs
bottled
offerings
and
while
not
outstanding
winterbock
is
better
than
some
of
the
others
ive
sampled
its
ok
id
never
seek
it
out
but
probably
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
drinkability
a
very
solod
dopple
extrmely
impressed
and
more
than
expected
drinkability
decent
brew
flavor
didnt
seem
as
bold
as
other
winter
bocks
ive
tasted
enjoyable
nonetheless
flavor
follows
the
nose
and
is
rather
light
yet
full
bodied
and
somewhat
simplesingular
at
the
same
time
the
body
cloaks
the
abv
well
yet
delivers
a
short
finish
with
a
touch
of
cinnamon
moderate
malts
work
well
with
the
carbonation
to
deliver
a
decent
feel
and
drinkability
nicely
balanced
drinkability
this
was
ok
i
have
had
better
bocks
but
it
is
still
ok
an
average
bock
but
thats
it
glassware
pint
taste
consists
mainly
of
sweet
burnt
caramel
and
toasty
malts
molasses
and
plenty
of
fusel
alcohol
i
was
really
disappointed
in
the
two
times
i
visited
the
brewpub
in
the
atl
but
this
beer
shows
some
promise
a
little
more
smooth
chocolate
maltiness
and
hide
the
abv
some
and
this
could
be
a
good
beer
overall
it
is
not
a
half
bad
attempt
at
a
db
but
needs
a
bit
more
refinement
to
hang
with
the
big
dawgs
from
deutschland
beer
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
lasting
tan
head
nose
initially
was
heavy
on
roasted
malts
becoming
sweeter
as
it
warms
taste
is
heavy
on
roasted
malts
and
finishes
somewhat
sweet
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
as
it
is
medium
bodied
decently
carbonated
and
fairly
smooth
across
the
palate
overall
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
pretty
good
representation
of
style
and
not
bad
to
try
pours
a
murky
brown
body
almost
black
with
no
lacing
but
a
superfoamy
twofinger
tan
head
that
takes
forever
to
die
a
mild
sweet
malt
smell
of
roasted
and
cocoa
malt
dominate
the
aroma
hints
of
coffee
not
a
particulary
thick
bock
but
not
thinnish
or
syrupy
either
a
mildmannered
but
pleasant
sweetness
with
hints
of
chocolate
caramel
toffee
butterscotch
and
other
sugariness
i
cant
think
of
not
overly
sweet
mind
you
has
minor
roasted
notes
and
hops
for
a
slick
but
hints
of
dryness
on
the
backbite
not
a
milkshake
here
mildly
warming
also
abv
hidden
well
i
wouldnt
guess
a
7
2
except
it
is
on
the
menu
d
decently
drinkable
if
i
had
a
sixer
i
wouldnt
have
any
problems
putting
it
away
i
just
dont
care
for
it
enough
to
seek
out
another
drinkability
i
wasnt
prepared
to
like
this
as
much
as
i
did
judging
from
the
other
reviews
but
this
is
a
very
nice
bock
pours
a
deep
amber
with
little
head
which
ill
admit
could
be
my
fault
as
im
using
a
new
glass
and
misjudged
the
pitch
anyways
the
head
quickly
recedes
to
a
thin
lacing
smell
is
rasins
light
prunes
and
very
strong
sugary
caramel
malt
taste
is
ripe
apricot
rasins
and
fruit
followed
by
a
drawnout
sweet
tasty
caramel
malt
alcohol
is
almost
undetectable
for
how
available
and
inexpensive
this
beer
is
id
say
its
a
fantastic
brew
but
i
had
pretty
low
expectations
a
solid
offering
no
doubt
and
competitive
with
the
original
german
versions
just
not
as
complex
as
mentioned
a
bit
too
sweet
and
alcoholy
for
my
taste
and
could
have
used
a
bit
more
fruit
fig
plum
aspects
instead
of
just
caramel
which
simply
dominated
personally
i
find
gordon
biersch
brews
to
be
a
little
under
whelming
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
offering
from
them
for
this
particular
style
ontap
at
flying
saucer
reviewed
from
notes
served
a
crisp
ruby
red
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
the
aroma
was
some
sweet
malts
and
fruits
the
taste
was
a
candylike
sweetness
with
some
dried
fruits
and
molasses
the
beer
was
medium
to
heavy
bodied
with
some
warming
alcohol
and
light
carbonation
this
one
is
somewhat
enjoyable
but
id
probably
not
seek
this
one
out
again
got
it
at
gordon
biersch
in
dc
poured
a
solid
tan
head
on
a
near
black
beer
kind
of
a
standard
doppelbock
sweet
and
slightly
spicy
in
both
the
nose
and
flavor
not
in
any
way
bad
and
actually
really
accessible
had
a
couple
nonbeery
work
friends
there
who
really
enjoyed
it
one
of
the
better
brews
ive
had
at
gb
pours
dark
brown
with
crimson
hues
and
is
topped
by
a
good
amount
of
tan
head
which
doesnt
fade
too
quickly
and
leaves
a
few
spots
of
lacing
behind
clusters
of
carbonation
bubbles
cling
to
the
glass
as
more
shoot
through
the
middle
of
the
brew
to
the
top
the
malts
smell
of
sweet
caramel
behind
that
are
subtle
notes
of
spice
cherries
and
vanilla
tastes
of
sweet
malts
cherries
coffee
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
slighty
creamy
and
it
goes
down
smooth
excellent
winter
ale
but
not
as
spicy
as
some
others
all
in
all
its
a
fairly
decent
doppelbock
but
not
close
to
the
better
german
examples
of
the
style
d
this
is
a
pretty
solid
dopplebock
with
an
easy
drinking
flavor
yet
a
solid
alcohol
kick
i
look
forward
to
this
seasonal
release
every
year
poured
a
very
light
browndark
gold
color
with
a
good
frothy
head
the
aroma
was
that
of
light
malt
and
alcohol
esters
the
flavor
was
good
german
malts
with
that
left
over
real
lager
twang
finished
really
dry
not
sweet
like
a
lot
of
bocks
a
good
seasonal
beer
well
carbonated
providing
a
slight
nice
prickly
kick
light
to
medium
in
body
this
is
pretty
tasty
and
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
deep
mohogany
opaque
hue
with
a
tan
two
finger
head
that
slowly
settles
to
a
thin
rim
along
the
glass
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
was
brown
sugar
with
a
little
bit
of
caramel
the
taste
had
a
little
bit
of
a
candy
like
flavor
mixing
in
with
some
more
caramel
flavors
the
bitterness
was
low
maybe
a
little
bit
from
the
carmelized
malts
full
bodied
the
finish
was
clean
with
a
little
bit
of
lingering
malts
the
taste
is
similar
mostly
burnt
caramel
and
raisin
some
alcohol
toastiness
sweet
with
a
burntcaramel
bitterness
in
the
finish
it
is
somewhat
full
bodied
and
rather
pleasant
but
the
flavours
a
bit
a
mild
and
simple
almost
onedimensional
pours
dark
amber
almost
amber
brown
into
my
flute
glass
good
head
sits
on
top
the
aroma
is
right
on
the
mark
for
a
doppelbock
raisins
bread
crust
some
alcohol
sweet
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
unlike
other
doppelbocks
out
there
this
one
is
lighter
on
the
palate
and
not
quite
as
malty
making
it
relatively
easier
to
drink
and
enjoy
oh
and
it
goes
well
with
pizza
taste
mouthfeel
fruity
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
burnt
caramel
not
nearly
as
clean
as
some
of
the
better
german
examples
of
the
style
ive
tried
recently
though
not
terrible
either
dried
fruit
and
nuts
a
bit
of
spice
too
sweet
overall
especially
in
the
finish
which
becomes
somewhat
cloying
after
half
a
bottle
a
decent
beer
but
im
glad
that
i
only
grabbed
1
bottle
i
was
suprised
to
see
this
in
bottles
and
i
guess
ill
review
this
as
the
vegas
location
drives
me
nuts
how
every
gb
has
a
different
location
when
from
my
understanding
the
bottles
are
produced
at
the
same
plant
anyways
nice
thick
and
creamy
head
very
dark
ruby
clear
with
a
ton
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
smell
is
almost
a
hefe
crossed
with
a
stout
some
fruit
aroma
as
well
as
a
nice
touch
of
caramel
taste
was
good
very
much
in
line
with
other
winter
beers
somer
dark
fruit
caramel
touch
of
chocolate
and
a
stronger
than
expected
straw
or
grass
taste
as
well
mouthfeel
was
pretty
thick
due
to
the
low
carbonation
but
i
didnt
really
enjoy
that
it
tasted
a
little
too
flat
for
me
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
another
strong
offering
from
gb
drinkability
i
know
this
is
for
the
winter
time
but
this
tasty
brew
could
be
enjoyed
yearround
very
surprised
by
how
good
this
was
this
is
on
my
return
to
list
for
sure
this
dark
double
bock
lager
is
my
favorite
out
of
the
gordon
biersch
variety
box
by
far
impressed
to
find
this
beer
floating
around
the
columbus
area
starts
off
with
a
rusty
plumby
color
with
a
mariginal
head
formation
but
retained
well
aromas
of
rich
malt
and
a
light
alcohol
scent
with
a
meaty
bready
savory
character
flavors
are
simple
and
clean
and
closely
mimic
the
character
found
in
the
nose
emphasis
on
the
rich
malt
flavors
light
on
esters
and
fermentation
byproducts
heavy
on
the
meaty
notes
as
clean
as
you
could
expect
a
dopplebock
to
finish
but
with
a
long
lingering
malty
richness
while
i
think
i
would
tire
of
this
after
more
than
one
bottle
it
certainly
can
hit
the
spot
if
in
the
mood
mahogany
colored
brew
with
an
offwhite
modest
head
and
medium
lacing
smells
of
raisin
and
spruce
the
taste
starts
with
alcohol
and
some
more
spruce
hops
fig
and
apple
a
bit
strong
in
alcohol
but
it
mellows
as
you
go
and
takes
on
more
malt
sweetness
the
feel
is
smooth
medium
bodied
with
medium
drinkability
a
nice
seasonal
offering
and
recommended
for
a
try
pours
mahogany
translucent
with
a
short
creamy
head
good
carbonation
nose
is
dominated
by
semisweet
malts
and
a
tinge
of
alcohol
taste
follows
with
overpoweringly
coffeeish
malts
moderately
bitter
and
rather
astringent
from
the
alcohol
it
gave
me
a
gag
reflex
slightly
when
i
first
drank
it
was
expecting
a
bit
more
balance
and
complexity
overall
not
too
impressed
maybe
would
be
better
on
tap
the
smell
and
taste
are
a
bit
thin
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
slight
sweet
maltiness
warming
alcohol
finiash
mouthfeel
thin
without
much
going
on
this
beer
is
drinkable
and
not
offensive
maybe
i
had
too
high
expectations
it
was
a
cold
windy
day
and
i
wanted
a
nice
hearty
malty
bock
beer
too
bad
this
didnt
cut
it
served
in
a
large
mug
with
just
a
short
cap
of
light
tan
foam
across
the
surface
the
very
dark
brown
body
revealed
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
the
aroma
was
malty
with
a
hint
of
roastiness
and
a
suggestion
of
chocolate
in
the
mouth
it
was
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
median
carbonation
that
gently
tingled
on
the
palate
the
flavor
was
fuller
than
the
aroma
suggested
and
in
addition
to
deep
caramel
with
an
almost
scorched
edge
there
was
some
dark
fruit
a
hint
of
spiciness
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
background
it
could
have
been
fuller
but
i
think
that
would
hurt
the
drinkability
as
it
is
its
quite
nicely
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
it
didnt
seem
strong
as
the
alcohol
was
never
noticeable
and
id
imagine
that
it
would
be
easy
to
order
a
third
glass
of
this
and
head
into
trouble
very
nicely
done
d
very
drinkable
winter
brew
perfect
on
a
warm
night
this
is
one
of
the
best
beer
i
feel
that
gordon
biersch
brews
very
nice
especially
on
tap
d
it
is
a
decent
weizenbock
but
nothing
to
go
crazy
about
there
are
a
lot
better
out
there
but
it
still
is
a
decent
beer
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
it
goes
down
easily
with
the
7
5
abv
is
not
worth
having
too
many
when
poured
it
was
a
dark
brown
with
very
little
tan
foam
the
smell
has
a
mild
aroma
of
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
roasted
malts
caramel
and
a
spice
or
two
not
overpowering
on
the
alcohol
or
the
bitternesssweetness
but
well
balance
between
all
three
components
a
pleasant
tasting
ale
for
the
old
and
new
year
comments

am
i
the
highball
here
this
was
my
first
beer
of
the
night
so
we
cant
blame
it
on
intoxication
it
is
a
terrific
beer
that
i
unrepentantly
replaced
with
my
usual
weizen
accompaniment
to
a
dish
of
weisswurst
and
red
cabbage
overall
i
am
not
overly
fond
of
anything
gordon
biersch
as
it
is
my
mom
had
a
few
bottles
of
this
and
i
snagged
one
for
the
hell
of
it
i
doubt
i
will
ever
dring
this
beer
again
it
was
booring
and
mediocre
at
best
overall
a
very
nice
seasonal
from
gb
perfect
for
sitting
outside
on
a
cooler
evening
in
honolulu
very
very
drinkable
goes
down
readily
i
think
two
will
give
you
that
winter
warmer
feeling
pours
a
golden
dark
amber
color
nice
carbonation
not
much
of
a
head
though
and
left
pretty
quickly
not
much
lacing
as
well
but
what
is
there
is
sticking
to
the
edges
scents
of
sweet
malts
slight
hops
and
caramel
the
taste
is
kinda
sweet
and
malty
nice
warm
feeling
in
the
throat
there
is
a
nice
hint
of
caramel
as
well
leaves
with
a
dry
finish
medium
body
well
balanced
brew
very
drinkable
a
nice
weizenbock
from
gb
would
recommend
the
regulars
at
the
bar
were
lobbying
for
this
to
join
the
standard
rotation
and
i
can
see
why
well
done
cheers
to
a
tasty
and
fairly
strong
beer
here
give
it
a
try
if
you
find
it
d
solid
winter
brew
good
times
this
is
really
a
different
and
very
nice
winter
warmer
that
lives
up
to
the
name
of
warmer
nice
comfortable
beer
to
finish
an
evening
with
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
definitely
one
of
their
best

is
malty
sweet
with
a
mild

hanging

an
ok

in

outstanding
bock

i
wont
buy

drinkability
no
it
doesnt
have
the
mindblowing
complexity
of
salvator
or
the
sinful
richness
of
koribinian
still
this
is
a
legit
and
quite
tasty
dopplebock
that
i
can
get
at
my
local
supermarket
for
less
than

a

you
could

mcmicro
shoots
and

this
is
a
seasonal
beer
so
grab
one
before
the
taps
run
out
served
on
tap
at
the
gb
in
pasadena
its
a
cloudy
amber
brown
with
a
thin
head
on
top
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
flowery
with
a
bit
of
fruity
sweetness
the
flavor
is
malty
sweet
with
a
bit
of
cinnamon
and
perhaps
pumpkin
but
it
is
all
a
bit
watery
there
is
no
hop
flavor
to
be
found
in
the
beer
and
overall
it
lacks
quality
flavor
and
complexity
there
is
certainly
nothing
exceptional
about
this
beer
this
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
dominated
by
the
malt
caramel
mostly
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
extremely
clean
but
the
flavor
and
aroma
arent
very
strong
in
fact
this
is
an
excellently
brewed
beer
without
the
slightest
flaw
in
any
way
and
theres
nothing
offputting
about
it
but
its
rather
boring
this
beer
was
very
simmilar
to
their
dunkel
but
it
seemed
like
an
upgrade
of
the
dunkel
the
color
and
head
were
about
the
same
but
this
brew
had
a
great
touch
of
spice
that
made
this
one
worth
comming
back
for
the
malt
profile
filled
everything
out
nicley
but
it
was
that
slight
hopspice
punch
that
really
took
this
beer
to
the
next
level
i
wish
they
would
bottle
this
stuff
on
draught
at
the
brewpub
this
beer
is
a
dark
rubybrown
color
with
a
medium
thick
and
foamy
light
beige
head
thin
lacing
malt
aroma
is
very
pronounced
and
there
is
some
caramel
as
well
creamy
if
slightly
thin
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
malt
flavor
along
with
some
chcolate
and
caramel
there
was
also
a
bit
of
a
smokey
character
to
it
which
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
the
finish
is
mostly
sweet
malt
with
a
pinch
of
hops
this
is
one
of
gordon
bierschs
better
offerings
in
my
opinion
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
nice
dark
tan
head
that
holds
on
most
of
the
way
down
the
glass
and
leaves
a
nice
lace
thick
biscuity
maltiness
with
almost
chewy
aspects
dominates
the
aroma
giant
bready
and
sweet
maltiness
is
all
over
the
flavor
here
nice
lightly
roasty
qualities
to
it
with
some
almost
chocolatelike
qualities
and
some
slight
warming
alcohol
presence
this
is
borderline
doppel
territory
here
big
bready
chewy
and
heavy
body
to
this
brew
with
a
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
this
put
off
my
grumbling
stomach
for
a
bit
with
its
huge
body
awesome
cool
weather
brew
excellent
for
warming
you
up
and
filling
you
up
as
well
i
would
drink
this
all
winter
long
if
i
had
a
gb
near
me
much
more
flavorful
than
their
generally
dull
brews
strong
with
an
earthy
fruit
presence
i
enjoyed
this
especially
be
cause
it
was
a
birthday
gift
i
believe
i
will
seek
some
more
out
soon
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
american
version
of
a
german
doppelbock
it
has
great
flavors
of
bready
toasted
malt
dried
stone
fruit
sweetness
nuttiness
and
slight
sourness
which
nicely
stood
up
to
4
years
of
aging
the
only
knock
i
have
against
this
specific
beer
is
the
floating
sedimentparticulates
im
not
sure
if
that
is
normal
or
an
unfortunate
sideeffect
of
being
aged
for
4
years
mixed
six
from
total
wine
in
plantation
great
bock
with
a
strong
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
dopplebock
only
knock
is
the
quite
subdued
aroma
tasty
this
beer
was
better
than
i
thought
that
it
would
be
i
really
liked
the
heavy
taste
that
it
uad
i
wish
that
this
beer
was
still
at
the
bar
that
i
go
to
i
wish
that
it
was
still
around
if
it
was
still
around
i
know
that
i
would
buy
myself
a
case
or
two
perfect
amber
brown
in
color
with
almost
no
head
and
a
thin
white
collar
aroma
is
caramel
malt
and
toasted
nuts
taste
is
a
good
crisp
caramel
maltiness
toffee
and
nuttiness
again
light
body
and
low
to
medium
carbonation
pretty
good
but
not
what
i
think
of
in
a
doppelbock
overallcomments
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
loved
how
it
stayed
so
true
to
the
style
excellent
mouthfeel
and

this
would
be
a
perfect

nothing
overpowers
any
other

note
again
very
well

low

taste
is
deceiving
all
in
an
excellent

of
the

a

out

excellent
highly
recommended
overall
too
cloying

for
my
taste
i
like
doppelbocks
to
be
complex
presenting
more
layers
of
flavor
to
you
as
you
continue
to
sip
this
version
felt
rather
onenote
in

nothing
objectively
bad
about
this
beer
however
except
for
the
possibility
of
my
having
a
pulled
a
bottle
that
wasnt
the
best
of
the
bunch
obviously
this
review
therefore
needs
to
be
taken
with
a
grain
of
salt
o
not
bad
not
devoid
from
off
flavors
though
average
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
has
all
the
bench
marks
of
the
style
and
honestly
smelled
like
a
fresh
import
in
my
pint
glass
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
any
fan
of
big
malty
beers
this
is
a
malt
bomb
o
go
figure
another
disgusting
beer
from
tommyknocker
this
is
an
awful
example
of
the
style
completely
unbalanced
and
overwhelming
with
thick
sweet
malts
and
artificial
fruit
flavors
and
repulsive

o
im

confused
i
will
buy

it
packs
a

of
a

which
i
respect
but
i
think
the
sugars
are
way
high
i
feel
like
this
is
a
beer
lollipop
o
a
great
sipper
a
good
companion
to

was
very
friendly
and
informative
the
flight
he
poured
also
impressed
me
they
did
a
lot
of
styles
very
well
that
i
dont
normally
love
like
the
maple
nut
brown
and
imperial
brown
and
they
had
some
styles
not
seen
as
often
in
the
american
craft
seen
like
a
rye
porter
and
the
doppelbock
that
were
done
very
well
it
isnt
easy
to
find
a
great
doppelbock
in
the
u
s
and
this
was
an
impressively
strong
example
after

this
was
what

used
to
drink
this
stuff
all
the
time
10
years
ago
but
i
never
see
it
around
anymore
i
recall
it
fondly
enough
to
be
intrigued
to
revisit
it
the
brew
pours
a
rich
mahogany
hue
and
for
that
the
flavor
and
body
hold
their
own
nicely
the
mouthfeel
makes
this
beer
though
with
toasted
oat
and
molasses
aromas
looks
light
bodied
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
deep
amber
looking
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
on
top
the
aroma
is
loaded
with
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
spice
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
pretty
strong
but
its
mostly
all
malts
and
not
much
else
to
balance
the
brew
out
it
packs
a
boozey
punch
too
which
isnt
too
bad
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thick
but
its
nothing
oily
the
beer
is
a
little
above
average
and
id
try
it
again
i
dont
like
the
taste
it
was
almost
painful
to
finish
but
i
decided
to
pull
through
not
for
me
overall
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
doppelbock
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
this
style
but
i
think
this
fits
the
bill
nicely
it
was
a
little
heavy
on
the
sweetness
and
the
alcohol
was
noticeable
but
that
didnt
hurt
this
brew
too
much
i
was
surprised
that
tommyknocker
put
a
bigger
beer
in
their
mixed
six
pack
brewerys
usually
dont
whip
out
the
big
guns
for
their
variety
packs
so
that
was
pretty
cool
they
earn
my
respect
for
doing
that
and
for
8
99
it
was
pretty
good
deal
i
would
buy
a
6
pack
of
this
beer
for
those
cold
spring
nights
and
i
would
for
sure
get
their
mixed
6
pack
again
it
had
good
variety
and
was
a
good
deal
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
bocks
and
malt
forward
beers
this
ones
a
keeper
d
yeah
sorry
a
notch
below
average
here
preference
on
not
having
another
one
and
a
slow
reluctant
to
finish
flavor
makes
me
only
happy
in
the
fact
that
i
purchased
a
single
here
butthead
yeah
i
pretty
much
feel
like
one
for
buying
this
thankfully
it
was
a
cheap
learning
experience
this
bottle
is
a
little
over
6
months
old
and
is
less
alcoholic
tasting
than
fresher
bottles
i
prefer
it
this
way
right
off
the
bat
an
amazing
color
ive
have
never
had
to
use
the
word
sunburst
to
describe
a
beer
then
the
taste
is
amazing
so
much
fruit
and
alcohol
it
almost
feels
likes
your
drinking
wine
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
some
and
get
past
the
abv
you
will
not
be
disappointed
not
much
more
to
say
just
go
pick
some
up
stay
thirsty
my
friends
little
to
no
head
and
it
was
a
very
appealing
dark
amber
color
when
i
sniffed
it
it
had
a
hint
of
metallic
and
slightly
hoppy
it
had
a
bitter
front
that
went
to
slightly
hoppy
and
i
thought
i
had
a
hint
of
black
cherry
it
cleansed
the
palate
quickly
i
would
drink
it
again
but
couldnt
have
too
many
felt
full
after
the
one
but
that
could
have
been
because
of
what
i
ate
there
is
a
little
blurb
about
brewery
freshness
and
enjoy
by
date
im
glad
i
missed
that
initially
because
this
5
year
old
bottle
is
complex
i
opened
it
right
after
i
opened
a
different
american
doppelbock
from
the
same
time
period
which
clearly
didnt
withstand
the
test
of
time
ill
tell
you
this
isnt
anything
mind
blowing
but
its
tasty
reasonably
cheap
and
remarkably
easy
to
drink
you
dont
get
a
lot
of
sessionable

thats

and
available
though
there
are
others
i
would
choose
in

this
was

was
a

it
didnt
really

the

some

and
lots

floating

it
had
a

beige
head
with

and
little
lacing
the
smell
was

a

the
taste
was
dark

sweet

somewhat
alcoholic
the
finish
was

dry
the

was
good
with
a

a

alcohol
driven
sweetness
to
make
it
really
drinkable
its
rich
and
it
is

but
maybe
a
little
to
much
of
both
drinkability
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
and
aroma
going
on
in
this
beer
it
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
love
the
malt
character
and
the
toffeecoffee
taste
to
it
i
think
the
alcohol
is
just
a
little
too
much
in
this
beer
i
also
think
it
was
lacking
some
carbonation
as
well
12oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
crisp
deep
brown
with
a
thin
quickly
diminishing
head
aroma
is
some
burnt
caramel
malts
and
slight
dried
fruit
the
taste
is
a
decent
blend
of
dried
fruits
molasses
and
caramel
malts
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
doppelbock
but
far
from
the
best
d
easily
drinkable
as
i
had
no
problems
finish
the
glass
the
unique
note
of
tea
i
caught
upfront
was
interesting
not
bad
and
did
not
detract
from
the
overall
experience
in
all
i
was
satisfied
upon
finishing
the
beer
and
could
likely
have
had
another
but
it
was
nothing
that
left
a
lasting
impression
upon
me
this
is
definitely
the
best
offering
ive
had
from
tommyknocker
great
beer
recommended
md
a
pretty
good
doppelbock
not
as
syrupy
as
i
expected
carbonation
is
very
brisk
here
definitely
worthy
of
a
purchase
d
very
good
i
like
doppelbocks
and
this
is
no
exception
nicely
sweet
and
well
rounded
nice
redamber
colored
with
a
whitetan
head
about
1
thick
that
dissapates
pretty
quickly
leaving
a
small
halo
and
a
little
bit
of
fine
lacing
its
got
a
few
carbonation
bubbles
still
it
smells
very
sweet
and
bready
some
chocolate
is
defintiely
amongst
a
few
other
malty
smells
i
cant
smell
much
if
any
hoppy
smells
but
it
may
be
because
of
the
malts
overpowering
them
taste
is
very
creamy
thats
the
first
thought
its
got
some
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
upfront
with
a
very
subtle
and
quick
hop
finish
overall
the
taste
itself
is
pretty
quick
but
good
aftertaste
is
mild
and
earthy
medium
bodied
a
little
thick
at
times
and
lightly
carbonated
its
a
decent
doppelbock
and
cheaper
than
several
others
in
its
class
taste
is
the
same
the
candy
cherry
flavors
sweet
malts
pretty
predictable
doppelbock
good
though
the
smoothness
is
remarkable
it
is
a
nice
thick
ale
but
it
still
goes
down
very
easily
perfect
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
i
have
a
really
good
impression
of
this
beer
excellent
too
much
alcohol
for
not
much
malty
goodness
meh
if
i
ever
get
an
opportunity
to
try
this
fresh
i
will
definitely
revisit
but
im
thinking
that
this
one
was
a
little
too
far
past
prime
nothing
earthshattering
about
this
beer
but
it
serves
the
dopplebock
style
well
ill
definitely
drink
more
of
this
in
the
future
d
like
the
maple
i
tried
a
few
hours
ago
this
beer
tastes
great
at
the
start
and
then
becomes
less
great
i
dont
usually
say
this
but
the
beer
should
be
consumed
quite
cold
d
very
easy
to
drink
though
a
bit
on
the
thick
side
you
may
want
to
sip
this
though
it
isnt
of
the
strongest
styles
full
bodied
deep
and
strong
with
robust
characteristics
conclusion
maybe
a
little
overdone
with
the
sweetness
but
a
great
beer
all
the
same
worth
drinking
just
to
see
it
d
the
flavours
on
this
one
were
quite
nice
its
too
bad
the
alcohol
wasnt
a
little
more
hidden
but
its
still
a
very
worthy
offering
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
malty
beers
but
the
caramel
sweetness
of
this
beer
is
balanced
by
the
bite
of
the
alcohol
and
the
nutty
finish
a
solid
beer
but
not
one
i
will
drink
with
any
regularity
mostly
due
to
my
preferences
and
not
to
the
beer
drinkability
4
out
of
5
the
sweetness
keeps
this
from
being
a
truly
drinkable
beer
i
could
have
two
and
call
it
a
night
still
for
an
8
2
abv
beer
thats
not
bad
considering
how
well
it
disguises
that
high
alcohol
content
its
great
for
a
nightcap
but
if
you
want
a
night
of
doppelbocks
opt
for
troegenator
or
samuel
adams
double
bock
instead
hazy
brown
color
with
no
head
but
a
fruity
bubblegum
and
sweet
plum
aroma
flavor
consisted
of
raisin
pine
and
vanilla
notes
soso
medium
full
mouthfeel
over
the
whole

is
the
highlight
here
not
much
drinkability
due
to
overpowering
alcohol
warming
feeling
as
it
goes
down
with
sour
fruit
aftertaste
as
it
warms
not
recommended
pours
a

reddish
brown
with

aromas
are
big
on
the

caramel
and
molasses
elements
with
some
yeastiness
also
detectable
i
was
about
to
disparage
the
flavors
as
being

run
amok
but
upon
second
sipping
i
noticed
that
notes
are

that
next
rung
in
my
opinion
zapoct

the
low
carbonation
compliments
this
beer
simply
put
aroma
definitely
gets
your
attention
strong
and
malty
with
a
caramel
overtone
and
notes
of
spice
and
chocolate
plus
an
earthy
hint
pours
a
translucent
chocolate
brown
close
to
mahogany
with
a
thick
and
fairly
persistent
tan
head
that
leaves
some
generous
lacing
flavor
does
not
quite
equal
the
promise
of
the
aroma
but
is
still
quite
good
malty
bready
subtle
notes
of
caramel
cloves
and
chocolate
smooth
texture
has
good
body
and
fizz
and
leaves
a
malty
woody
slightly
chocolaty
finish
get
this
goat
a
solid
drink
pure
awesomeness
overall
i
havent
read
a
review
yet
for
this
beer
but
i
can
see
the
reviews
being
a
over
the
place
definitely
more
of
a
warm
weather
beer
really
doesnt
need
tweaking
and
honestly
i
would
be
glad
to
buy
another
bottle
salud
d
a
most
outstanding
doppelbock
which
shouldnt
be
a
surprise
coming
from
a
fine
brewery
like
great
divide
the
only
real
constructive
criticism
is
that
a
bit
more
of
a
robust
mouthfeel
would
go
a
long
way
to
making
this
offering
truly
world
class
with
that
aside
this
is
still
an
terrific
well
rounded
lager
with
lots
to
offer
to
all
those
who
encounter
it
love
the
aroma
of
this
beer
has
good
lacing
and
maintains
a
minimal
cream
colored
head
to
the
finish
dark
cloudy
amber
color
with
sweet
notes
on
the
pallet
the
8
abv
is
the
con
on
this
one
after
half
pint
one
starts
to
taste
the
alcohol
instead
of
the
caramel
toffee
flavor
overall
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
two
pint
wonder
on
movie
night
at
home
great
taste
overall
coming
into
this
brew
i
wasnt
really
expecting
much
but
boy
was
i
blown
away
not
just
another
boring
bock
but
something
special
the
sweet
cocoa
and
malty
bitterness
really
balances
out
the
flavors
and
brings
everything
together
delicious
and
goes
down
quite
smooth
i
would
try
again
and
would
totally
recommend
to
a
friend
cheers
o
this
is
a
very
good
dopplebock
and
a
great
beer
to
put
in
the
fridge
it
was
very
much
like
the
german
dobbelbocks
but
had
a
nice
addition
of
local
flavors
to
enhance
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
a
little
flat
maybe
age
quite
sticky
overall
its
not
bad
not
special
but
i
wouldnt
consider
this
a
definitive
review
being
more
than
1
5
years
past
the
bottled
on
date
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
had
a
lot
going
on
with
really
nice
balance
a
great
go
at
probably
my
favorite
style
of
beer
so
yummy
masterfully
brewed
another
home
run
from
great
divide
a
whole
bomber
to
myself
lucky
me
i
actually
picked
up
on
something
like
dank
rotting
wood
but
in
a
really
nice
way
maybe
thats
just
the
pacific
northwesterner
in
me
the
alcohol
is
present
but
like
the
rest
of
the
various
aspects
not
cloying
or
at
the
front
everything
moves
in
and
out
im
the
type
to
eat
and
drink
slowly
for
the
most
part
so
ill
take
a
few
deep
drinks
and
then
let
the
beer
sit
on
the
table
for
five
minutes
i
think
the
tortoise
had
it
right
slow
and
steady
wins
the
race
my
second
or
third
time
lifting
the
glass
actually
presented
a
kind
of
soy
or
tamari
quality
with
salt
lingering
i
also
get
tar
if
that
makes
sense
kind
of
as
a
deeper
extension
of
the
licorice
interesting
beer
no
doubt
nye
bottle

with

decent

prost
othis
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
example
of
the
style
with
a
few
quirks
the
look
and
smell
are
spoton
for
a
doppelbock
but
the
taste
throws
a
few
curveballs
that
i
cannot
fully
endorse
the
first
curve
is
the
strange
almost
spicy
zesty
character
that
accompanies
the
malt
bill
and
the
second
curve
is
the
strangely
herbalfloral
finish
these
oddities
dont
kill
the
beer
but
they
take
it
off
style
and
im
not
sure
i
agree
with
them
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
little
hop
bitterness
some
alcohol
in
the
taste
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
version
of
an
american
dopplebock
some
places
just
seem
to
do
a
lot
right
deschutes
the
bruery
russian
river
green
flash
even
stone
and
lost
abbey
among
others
i
have
come
to
feel
great
divide
is
another
one
of
those
places
i
love
the
dopplebock
and
that
is
a
style
most
of
those
other
breweries
just
listed
dont
seem
to
have
a
great
one
of
if
even
one
at
all
o
a
great
example
of
a
doppelbock
i
wish
there
was
more
of
an
aroma
but
other
than
that
this
beer
hits
it
all
o
great
example
of
this
style
and
non
metallic
tasting
which
seems
to
plague
doppelbocks
for
me
overall
this
one
of
the
better
domestic
doppelbocks
available
pours
a
dark
amber
with
one
finger
light
tan
bubbly
head
head
dissipates
rather
quickly
strong
aroma
right
off
the
bat
smells
sweet
malty
and
bready
definitely
some
chocolate
and
tartness
in
the
aroma
as
well
medium
bodied
with
great
feel
sweet
malty
and
bready
with
a
slight
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
hard
to
explain
since
i
am
new
to
this
style
definitely
fits
the
meal
in
a
glass
description
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
having
had
many
products
from
great
divide
including
a
stop
at
the
brewery
itself
i
was
excited
to
give
this
beer
a
try
it
is
delicious
there
is
a
reasonable
amount
of
maltiness
its
mildly
sweet
and
thankfully
has
very
little
hop
bite
flavor
and
aroma
is
interesting
pleasant
caramel
comes
through
as
well
as
believe
it
or
not
a
hint
of
banana
overall
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
neither
a
sipper
nor
a
gulper
the
marmalade
was
an
unexpected
yet
fun
surprise
was
lacking
in
the
darker
fruits
and
chocolatey
flavors
that
are
common
for
this
beer
style
but
this
did
not
seem
to
detract
the
clean
quality
and
finish
made
this
an
excellent
representation
of
a
doppelbock
in
that
the
beer
was
flavorful
and
strong
yet
still
had
the
clarity
and
lightness
of
a
lager
although
a
high
abv
it
didnt
taste
like
it
did
i
wish
i
had
had
some
cheese
to
have
with
this
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
enjoy
over
a
period
of
time
i
think
it
would
greatly
benefit
with
a
food
pairing
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
some
beautiful
crimson
highlights
a
substantial
onefinger
tan
head
that
reduced
to
a
14
but
that
holds
its
own
ripe
dark
fruit
scents
plum
dates
raisins
banana
some
caramel
and
toffee
notes
too
dark
rum
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
onedimensional
sweet
sugary
boozesoaked
fruit
cookies
fig
newtons
come
to
mind
and
there
is
a
breadiness
to
it
the
lacing
is
exceptional
and
the
carbonation
is
understated
not
too
syrupy
or
viscous
mouthfeel
had
a
medium
body
with
a
good
caramel
like
stickyness
to
it
medium
carbonation
and
very
slight
dry
finish
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
12
inch
head
of
a
white
color

retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
slight
roasted
malt
earthy
malt
hint
of
hops
hint
of
pale
malt
and
slight
alcohol
fits
the
style
of
doppelbock
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
slight
caramel
malt
slight
earthy
malt
hint
of
hops
slight
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
pale
malt
overall
not
enough
hops
to
balance
the
high
levels
of
malt
but
good
flavors
o
a
very
nice
beer
not
a
style
i
have
great
familiarity
with
but
i
found
this
similar
in
feel
and
presentation
to
the
ayinger
doppelbock
but
the
sugars
were
a
little
more
forward
and
there
was
less
complexity
to
the
flavor
a
rewarding
drink
in
any
event
overall
a
very
enjoyable
doppelbock
that
has
a
nice
focus
on
the
maltiness
without
being
overtly
hoppy
easy
to
consume
this
one
overall
worthy
of
the
8
dollar
price
tag
but
i
kind
of
wish
this
was
bottled
in
12
oz
singles
since
the
price
would
rival
ayinger
celebrator
doppelbock
and
i
could
pull
the
trigger
easier
regardless
they
do
make
a
great
doppelbock
great
to
find
a
bottle
of
this
i
was
kind
of
pissed
when
i
missed
its
release
last
summer

a

that
with

juicy

that
dark

you
can
only
get
from
the
source
a
definite
german
style
lager
from
colorado
excellent
take
by
all
means
im
just
so
spoiled
to
have
tried
so
many
great
doppelbocks
from
pa
they
are
the
kings
of
the
german
beer
styles
brewed
in
america
with
minor
exceptions
along
the
way
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
toffee
as
i
take
a
few
more
sips
with
the
dark
fruit
a
mesmerizing
beer
experience
im
glad
im
digging
in
now
a
year
later
mouthfeel
is
great
smooth
easy
going
each
sip
easier
than
the
next
im
glad
i
found
it
subdued
and
refrigerated
for
a
year
its
been
truly
lagered
easy
going
carbonation
great
chewy
dopplebock
medium
to
full
bodied
overall
i
cant
stop
talking
about
this
beer
excellent
stuff
nails
the
style
truly
good
drinking
doppelbock
they
better
still
make
this
stuff
o
this
is
surprisingly
balanced
there
is
nothing
obscene
about
this
beer
and
the
8
alcohol
not
even
noticeable
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
off
the
charts
a
rich
beer
very
enjoyable
overall
i
liked
it
better
than
i
thought
i
would
worth
a
try

i
have

cuts
through

palate
on

caramel
and
some
dark
toffee
all
mix
together
with
a
faint

rich

and
strong
a
pretty
good
doppelbock
if
i
do
say
so
im
on
the
fence
with
this
beer
it
looked
nice
but
it
smelled
and
tasted
like
something
was
holding
it
back
i
might
try
it
again
in
the
future
thats
because
its
a
solid
doppelbock
the
beer
is
a
deep
dark
mahogany
color
a
foamy
cream
colored
head
recedes
to
large
bubbles
and
wisp
webbed
sticky
lacing
coats
the
glass
the
aroma
is
toffee
and
caramel
sweetness
followed
by
an
oak
wood
note
with
a
faint
smokiness
the
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
with
delicious
sweet
caramel
and
buttery
sweet
bread
starting
off
toffee
comes
in
the
middle
with
a
slight
woody
quality
to
finish
it
faint
hops
in
the
finish
that
leaves
a
slight
tang
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
otherwise
medium
in
weight
overall
this
is
truly
delicious
i
need
to
drink
more
dopplebocks
overall
better
than
most
of
the
domestic
examples
of
the
style
i
have
tried
as
it
avoids
the
cloying
sweetness
still
it
lacks
some
of
the
malty
depth
and
complexity
of
the
best
of
the
german
examples
overall
an
enjoyable
and
worthy
take
on
the
noble
style

to
get
to
try

aged

a
good
beer
definitely
not
an
americanized
version
of
the
style
and
yet
not
as
refined
as
the
stalwarts

in
germany
poured

pours
a

some
sweetness
medium
body
fairly
good
o
a
great
dopplebock
and
i
have
to
admit
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
be
this
enjoyable
especially
after
the
one
strange
component
of
the
smell
glad
to
see
a
great
dopplebock
released
by
an
american
brewery
overall
this
as
a
remarkably
balanced
example
of
the
style
worth
seeking
out
for
fans
of
the
style
while
sweet
this
is
not
an
overly
sweet
beer
my
wife
however
disagrees
leaving
me
with
the
full
bomber
all
to
myself
and
i
find
the
level
of
hops
nicely
balances
things
out
a
very
agreeable
beer
but
i
would
expect
that
from
great
divide
o
this
beer
seems
quite
balanced
and
drinkable
compared
to
other
doppelbocks
because
it
isnt
as
heavy
on
the
palate
and
doesnt
have
any
stickiness
o
kudos
for
great
divide
for
even
making
a
doppelbock
this
underappreciated
and
underrepresented
style
needs
more
brewers
to
step
up
to
the
plate
and
deliver
for
liquid
bread
the
viscosity
of
this
doppelbock
was
a
little
thin
and
the
flavours
were
a
little
uncharacteristic
however
this
is
still
a
good
doppelbock
that
is
worth
trying
but
so
far
my
favourite
north
american
take
on
the
style
is
from
les
trois
mousquetaires
in
quebec
ill
likely
purchase
another
bottle
of
this
when
i
get
a
hankering
for
a
doppelbock
again
or
just
need
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
bit
more
malt
and
a
bit
more
character
to
it
pours
a
deep
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
smattering
of
bubbles
on
top
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
burnt
sugars
and
light
sweet
dark
fruits
along
with
a
bit
of
toffee
that
seems
a
bit
out
of
place
faint
floral
hop
aroma
provides
little
balance
to
the
malty
sweetness
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
lots
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
flavors
and
a
bit
of
burnt
sugar
sweetness
light
prune
flavor
along
with
a
weak
coffee
type
melanoid
thing
going
on
medium
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
crisp
mouthfeel
i
find
that
so
many
american
breweries
try
to
replicate
the
dopplebock
style
and
cant
seem
to
pull
it
off
this
is
a
fine
beer
but
compared
to
some
of
the
hallmarks
of
the
style
it
just
doesnt
compare
the
smooth
melanoid
and
rich
dark
dried
fruits
are
lacking
in
this
example
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
has
some
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
very
similar
there
is
some
roasted
malt
and
a
very
light
hint
of
smoke
i
also
get
some
chocolate
and
some
dark
fruit
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
this
might
be
my
favorite
offering
from
gd
for
once
a
american
brewery
can
make
an
exceptional
german
dopplebock
find
it
drink
it
its
liquid
bread
a
meal
in
its
self
3
0
d
its
not
a
bad
beer
and
its
definitely
drinkable
but
there
isnt
enough
flavor
to
put
this
anywhere
above
average
lots
of
toast
and
biscuit
on
the
tongue
theres
a
touch
of
burnt
malt
but
its
in
the
background
light
hop
and
even
a
lighter
body
carbonation
is
fine
overall
easy
to
drink
but
not
that
complex
very
clean
and
bready
nothing
complex
but
very
precise
malts
it
drinks
very
new
but
i
like
it
not
sure
why
they
called
this
wolfgang
for
a
dopplebock
bottled
in
june
2012
maple
syrup
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
and
good
clarity
pours
with
a
strong
stiff
offwhite
foam
with
excellent
staying
power
that
leaves
wet
sheets
of
lacings
on
the
glass
sweet
caramel
malt
ripe
apple
fig
and
chocolate
aromas
with
subtle
herbal

up

ripe

and

flavors
follow
with
dark
bready
nutty
and
light
boozy
flavors
to
the
finish
wonderful
earthy
flavors
and
aromas
with
a
sesational
feel
wish
great
divide
would
put
this
is
12
oz
bottles
a
fabulous
autumnwinter
sipper
smells
of
chocolate
and
yeasty
bread
with
just
the
right
amount
of
herbal
and
earthy
hopping
to
accent
the
sweet
aroma
taste
is
centered
around
toasted
bread
in
front
with
medium
amounts
of
nuttiness
and
lesser
quantities
of
chocolate
and
yeastiness
in
the
background
as
the
glass
warms
the
herbal
and
earthy
hopping
aspects
gain
enough
volume
to
make
one
of
the
more
strikingly
dry
finishes
ive
ever
tasted
in
a
doppelbock
in
fact
overall
this
beer
seems
to
be
balanced
more
towards
being
savory
and
bready
than
being
about
caramel
and
toffee
and
im
totally
ok
with
that
however
on
the
other
hand
there
is
only
the
merest
ghost
of
a
presence
of
dark
fruits
in
either
nose
or
flavor
which
could
stand
to
be
somewhat
bigger
relative
to
all
the
other
elements
the
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
fairly
low
amounts
of
carbonation
leading
to
a
smooth
though
tooplacid
mouthfeel
finish
is
expectedly
dry
from
hop
usage
and
residual
sweetness
of
the
beer
overall
this
is
good
doppelbock
that
is
another
good
offering
from
great
divide
there
is
a
very
slight
metalic
taste
present
but
not
a
factor
for
me
pours
a
caramel
looking
brown
with
a
nice
beige
head
a
nice
bready
aroma
filled
with
some
toffee
caramel
a
little
nutty
flavor
was
very
smooth
also
filled
with
bread
toffee
caramel
and
a
little
nutty
it
never
gets
too
aggressive
and
offered
a
great
balance
a
nice
fuller
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
totally
hit
the
spot
at
the
bar
tonight
id
put
this
right
behind
the
yeti
series
for
my
favorite
offering
from
great
divide
might
have
to
go
out
and
grab
myself
a
bomber
of
this
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
goblet
bottled
on
july
03
2012
this
pours
a
clearish
dark
brown
with
a
smaller
short
lived
tan
head
the
smells
are
good
toffee
caramel
roasted
nuts
the
feel
is
medium
to
a
little
thicker
and
creamy
the
taste
is
pretty
great
roasted
nuts
caramel
dark
fruit
quite
nice
overall
a
really
nice
beer
and
perfect
for
the
fall
season
now
they
just
need
to
make
it
a
six
pack
d
very
drinkable
nice
malty
backbone
with
some
good
roast
and
body
to
balance
ontap
poured
into
a
tulip
clear
russet
brown
thin
head
of
khaki
foam
forms
from
a
mild
carbonation
dark
rye
bread
raisin
and
toffee
clean
mellow
and
dry
which
is
something
american
brewers
typically
dont
achieve
with
this
style
a
wellaged
musty
character
creeps
in
and
adds
some
depth
light
floral
hoppiness
adds
balance
another
well
done
balanced
yet
big
beer
from
great
divide
o
unlike
many
american
versions
of
this
style
it
is
not
cloyingly
sweet
this
is
much
more
true
to
the
german
version
of
the
style
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
hides
the
8
abv
extremely
well
very
enjoyable
and
definitely
a
beer
i
would
get
again
not
usually
a
huge
bock
or
derivative
fan
but
this
one
is
perfectly
true
to
the
style
and
i
love
it
for
the
fall
it
pours
deep
and
alluring
low
glow
red
color
like
cherry
wood
its
got
a
one
inch
thick
caramel
colored
head
that
lasts
the
whole
glass
smell
is
big
big
german
malts
autumnally
appropriate
maple
sugary
the
flavor
is
more
than
just
the
malts
although
they
are
there
in
a
big
way
there
is
also
an
earthy
yeast
that
makes
me
feel
like
raking
leaves
carving
pumpkins
and
smoking
a
turkey
all
day
its
just
that
kind
of
beer
and
flavor
profile
the
feel
is
outstanding
its
got
a
huge
body
on
it
but
its
still
plenty
drinkable
the
sweetness
up
front
and
not
in
the
finish
which
i
am
not
used
to
but
really
liked
in
this
beer
the
finish
is
bready
and
quick
its
a
lovely
bomber
of
beer
for
less
than
8
bucks
ill
be
enjoying
this
all
fall
this
beer
pours
out
a
deep
ruby
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
chocolatey
with
some
bread
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
robust
amount
of
malts
theres
roast
and
bready
aspects
here
for
sure
along
with
some
chocolate
and
caramel
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
decently
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
great
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
doppelbocks
ive
had
easily
its
not
up
on
celebrators
level
or
anything
but
its
a
great
stab
at
the
style
d
very
drinkable
especially
at
the
abv
great
divide
never
ceases
to
pump
out
quality
brews
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
doppelbocks
brewed
on
this
side
of
the
pond
the
alcohol
barely
makes
its
presence
known
im
not
quite
sure
this
lives
up
to
the
german
greats
but
it
comes
damn
close
o
very
good
nice
complexity
and
very
well
done
great
divide
makes
some
great
beers
and
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
a
nice
enough
domestic
version
of
the
style
though
for
the
life
of
me
i
cannot
imagine
why
id
want
to
drink
this
over
some
of
the
better
versions
readily
available
from
germany
the
flavor
matched
the
aroma
in
many
ways
but
with
some
additional
nutty
notes
and
marshmallow
it
is
a
jaunty
beer
that
steps
lightly
despite
its
8
abv
the
creaminess
of
the
head
although
it
did
not
retain
thickly
settling
rather
quickly
into
a
film
with
some
fluff
around
the
edges
played
well
with
the
flavors
o
i
liked
it
a
good
example
of
an
american
made
doppelbock
solid
great
beer
o
a
decent
doppelbock
from
a
well
respected
american
brewery
wolfgang
is
worth
seeking
out
if
you
want
to
try
something
new
a
decent
dopplebock
could
easily
replace
the
raisin
bread
for
your
morning
breakfast
amazing
must
try
overall
wow
this
is
nice
sweet
easy
to
drink
and
pakcs
a
punch
very
balanced
even
with
it
being
sweet
and
it
gets
real
sweet
once
it
warms
up
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
a
great
beer
one
of
the
best
doppels
ie
had
in
a
long
time
o
i
expected
this
to
be
good
but
i
was
shocked
at
how
good
it
really
was
it
was
rich
and
earthy
a
complex
balanced
treat
that
is
hard
to
find
flaws
in
great
divide
really
nailed
this
style
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on

of
the
beer
a
foamy
curtain
of
lace

toasted

much
the
same
with
a
slightly
fruity
flavor
there
is
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty

easy
to
drink

been
a
while
since
ive
been
really
impressed
with
one
of
great
divides
bomber
releases
todayim
really
impressed
with
wolfgang
this
is
very
good
stuff
its
very
flavorful
and
is
extremely
enjoyable
great
divide
did
a
great
job
with
this
one
keep
this
one
in
the
rotation
please
easy
recommendation

theres
some

bread
involved
and
i
go
looking
for
spice
but
cant
find
any
its
a
bit
sticky
as
it
should
be
and
the
alcohol
is
there
but
not
overwhelming
creamy
up
front
with
some
crisp
edges
drier
than
expected
a
welcome
end
of
the
summer
treat
that
i
will
likely
revisit
soon
overall
i
think
i
want
to
pick
up
another
i
enjoyed
the
beer
from
start
to
finish
a
fantastic
brew
overall
wolfgang
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
its
flavor
profile
just
doesnt
float
my
boat
o
notably
unique
brew
that
is
a
must
try
if
available
this
contributes
an
enjoyable
twist
to
the
style
and
it
does
well
to
deliver
an
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
8
beer
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
blend
of
flavors
went
down
alot
lighter
than
8
o
a
good
dark
lager
generally
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
one
of
the
better
examples
ive
had
o
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
dopplebock
nice
to
find
it
on
tap
in
columbia
o
a
solid
lager
for
sure
the
price
is
problematic
when
compared
with
germany
but
surely
worth
a
try
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
balance
of
earthy
hops
sweet
and
roasted
malt
and
dark
fruit
notes
slightly
earthy
and
bitter
up
front
with
some
resinous
hops
that
linger
throughout
surprising
for
the
style
although
the
hop
character
is
stronger
than
expected
the
complex
malt
character
dominates
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
roasted
notes
with
subtle
smokiness

well
masked
with
no

to
speak

complex
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
wolfgang
exemplifies
the
doppelbock
style
on
par
with
many
of
the
better
german
varieties
and
wellworth
grabbing
a
bottle
or
two
or
three
or
o
this
one
hits
its
mark
most
american
doppels
tend
to
be
way
too
crazy
this
one
is
reminiscent
of
traditional
german
doppelbocks
a
good
summer
beer
but
not
really
sessionable
due
to
the
high
abv
i
wish
i
had
a
big
ceramic
mug
for
this
bad
boy
that
would
be
perfect
o
a
very
solidly
made
easy
to
drink
beer
drinkable
great
divide
does
not
make
bad
beer
its
official
note
i
love
doppelbocks
and
am
usually
disappointed
by
nonbavarian
versions
so
take
that
into
account
a
good
us
version
probably
gets
a
little
extra
support
from
me
im
not
saying
my
rating
is
inflated
but
people
that
dont
love
doppelbocks
might
have
differing
opinions

i
found
the

intriguing
the
dry

was
a
little
strange
but
a
minor
flaw
a
worthy
effort
o
a
pretty
good
doppelbock
it

clean

has
good

dangerously

overall
very
nice

enjoyed
very
much
overall
a
nice
rich

sweet
doppelbock
this
beer
does
not
get
in
you
face
like
many
other
american
brewed
versions
very
well
balanced
and
drinkable
for
its
size
on
par
with
its
german
counterparts
hunt
this
one
down
this
was
disappointing
the
toasted
malt
notes
dominated
throughout
there
were
subtle
hints
of
a
solid
doppelbock
underneath
the
toasted
malt
but
it
had
no
hope
of
coming
out
ill
pass
on
this
in
the
future
very

not
great

summer
release
not
ideal
for
florida
heat
in
the
dead
of
summer
o
this
would
pair
perfect
with
a
really
sharp
cheese
one
of
the
most
flavorful
beers
while
still
maintaining
a
level
of
drinkability
reminds
me
of
a
mild
more
drinkable
scottish
ale
overall
full
bodies
beer
for
the
season
fairly
complex
and
nice
beer
for
the
style
for
a
robust
summer
beer
this
isnt
bad
at
all
a
nice
doppelbock
from
gd
would
go
well
with
some
bbq
dark
meats
an
odd
choice
for
a
summer
seasonal
maybe
but
hey
maybe
not
bottled
on
june
5th
2012
poured
into
a
12
leter
stein
a
deep
amber
tinged
mahagony
with
great
looking
sticky
off
white
crown
atop
alot
of
bready
malt
and
molasses
in
the
nosea
whiff
of
alcohol
and
caramel
as
well
caramel
and
molasses
flavors
with
a
tinge
of
dark
fruitan
underlying
bready
maltiness
is
the
main
component
of
the
flavor
profile
just
a
tad
thin
in
the
feel
but
this
is
a
real
nice
doppelbockmaybe
not
a
beer
i
would
wanna
drink
in
the
heat
of
summer
but
very
good
none
the
less
lackluster
in
all
realms
that
should
be
satisfying
when
associated
with
a
bock
style
beer
poured
it
correctly
but
left
no
head
fowl
in
appearance
and
in
taste
abv
content
on
label
is
debatable
definitely
a
falsely
advertised
big
beer
a
great
abundance
of
sediment
at
the
bottom
thats
more
than
acceptable
would
not
recommend
it
slow
sipper
rich
and
aggressive
in
flavors
way
over
the
usual
doppelbock
stats
counts
as
a
plus
but
also
as
a
minus
careful
with
this
one
o
a
sticky
sweet
malt
bomb
that
was
complex
and
smooth
enough
to
be
interesting
but
became
a
bit
of
a
chore
halfway
through
the
bottle
good
for
what
it
is
though
thanks
again
eric
o
this
is
a
malt
bomb
it
is
high
in
alcohol
and
high
is
sweet
malty
flavors
i
like
it
i
think
is
has
aged
wonderfully
and
developed
into
a
very
good
beer

incredibly
complex
nearly
as
big
this
is
one
of
those
brews
that
im
happy
to
have
experienced
because
its
like
nothing
ive
tasted
before
its
like
a
lager
was
drowned
in
the
liquid
resurrected
very
good
beer
previous
review
was
a
4
didnt
note
which
year
just
had
a
2011
which
was
pretty
unpleasant
once
it
warmed
up
a
touch
from
being
in
the
fridge
2
0
averaging
the
two
for
a
3
rating
o
one
hell
of
a
heavy
dopplebock
triplebock
drinks
like
slightly
watered
down
syrup
lots
of
sharp
booze
which
actually
cuts
the
thickness
a
bit
quite
harsh
once
its
fully
warm
alcohol
isnt
even
remotely
hidden
complex
with
lots
of
malt
character
i
enjoyed
this
but
drinkability
suffers
from
the
thickness
and
extreme
booziness
a
nice
unique
brew
to
try
once
but
nothing
id
get
again
still
tasty
regardless
kind
of
what
i
expected
not
special
but
was
still
nice
to
try
once
overall
this
is
a
killer
big
beer
drink
it
fast
though
cause
it
is
more
abrasive
as
it
warms
kuhnhenns
makes
some
great
big
beers
a
very
nice
offering
but
with
most
of
their
beers
an
expensive
one
to
bother
purchasing
again
overall
im
normally
not
a
fan
of
doppel
or
triple
even
bocks
but
this
was
nice
enough
that
i
wish
i
had
more
than
the
one
bottle
nice
pretty
authentic
and
rich
flavor
for
an
american
doppeltriplebock
with
a
nice
aged
touch
to
it
a
bit
on
the
sweeter
side
and
alcoholic
as
expected
but
fitting
tastes
very
smooth
cocoa
dusted
dried
bing
cherries
malted
milk
balls
and
a
touch
of
brazil
nut
maybe
throw
in
some
cocoa
krispies
it
fairly
sweet
as
well
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
rich
syrupy
almost
but
never
cloying
the
malts
are
really
complex
and
nice
about
a
1000x
better
than
sam
adams
attempt
at
a
triple
bock
dark
heathen
hoists
a
big
and
boisterous
body
sticky
thick
and
almost
creamy
on
the
mouth
feel
with
lowmedium
carbonation
i
was
really
taken
back
by
how
easy
this
was
to
drink
it
holds
the
power
of
a
20
abv
brew
while
drinking
more
like
a
67
i
wish
i
could
have
grabbed
a
few
bottles
of
this
as
it
turned
out
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
day
the
reviews
about
this
beer
are
dead
on
regarding
taste
smell
mouthfeel
etc
i
can
only
chime
in
to
say
if
your
into
a
sweeter
beer
with
a
heavy
mouthfeel
and
a
sweet
nose
but
quite
honestly
all
were
perfectly
balanced
for
me
than
this
is
it
frigging
12
5
alcohol
but
i
agree
with
most
to
say
its
a
slight
alcohol
warmth
not
burn
just
try
it
overall
i
know
its
supposed
to
be
boozy
but
this
is
pretty
harsh
i
hesitate
to
say
i
wish
it
were
sweeter
o
complex
and
a
smooth
sipper
that
will
creep
up
on
you
very
quickly
the
extreme
nature
pushes
the
envelope
way
beyond
the
style
and
id
much
prefer
a
more
traditional
doppelbock
m
deep
body
rich
full
slightly
cloying
o
overall
for
as
high
in
alcohol
as
this
beer
is
it
is
fairly
well
hidden
with
only
a
light
presence
in
the
mouthfeel
the
beer
needs
to
be
slipped
slowly
but
is
enjoyable

overall
this
is
an
excellent
imperial

style
great
balance
and
complexity
of

flavors
and
quite
smooth
to
sip
on
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
overall
if
you
like
tons
of
licorice
this
might
be
your
holy
grail
despite
that
i
was
quite
impressed
with
how
well
balanced
this
is
while
still
keeping
it
toned
down
in
the
thickness
of
what
it
could
be
as
well
as
the
expertly
well
integrated
alcohol
reminds
me
of
a
more
balanced
less
alcoholic
samichlaus
o
not
only
is
this
the
perfect
beer
for
the
subzero
night
we
are
having
but
it
is
also
one
of
the
best
bocks
ive
had
there
was
an
extremely
nice
complexity
in
this
with
just
the
right
sweetness
and
alcohol
warmth
to
make
you
feel
it
but
not
detract
too
much
from
the
taste
i
definitely
recommend
checking
this
out
if
you
like
high
abv
beers
with
a
nice
sweet
dark
fruit
complexity
overall
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
im
not
always
a
fan
of
the
style
probably
because
its
such
a
hard
one
to
get
right
kuhnhenn
has
got
this
one
right
o
still
pretty
hot
for
being
a
year
or
so
old
its
no
aventinus
eisbock
but
pretty
good
and
would
like
to
try
a
2
or
3
year
old
bottle
drink
it
was
good
i
admit
i
really
enjoy
kuhnhenn
anyway
it
was
a
bit
thin
and
a
bit
sweet
and
boozy
but
sometimes
a
good
bock
can
be
that
way
odcool
beer
not
really
my
style
but
i
can
now
see
why
kuhnhenn
is
a
superb
brewery
i
am
impressed
by
how
well
the
flavors
have
melded
together
must
try
more
from
them
somehow
overall
this
is
an
interesting
brew
this
is
definitely
not
a
session
style
ale
and
it
is
full
of
complexities
to
consider
while
sipping
for
my
personal
tastes
this
is
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
procure
again
this
beer
is
more
of
a
palate
expanding
experience
for
me
as
opposed
to
cherished
drinking
session
o
overall
a
very
nice
dopplebock
heavy
on
the
dark
fruits
and
very
malty
this
is
a
strong
beer
but
doesnt
taste
quite
12
5
abv
definitely
worth
checking
out
but
a
bit
of
a
sipper
o
an
interesting
though
not
terribly
successful
beer
its
a
bit
too
simple
and
overly
sweet
for
my
tastes
overall
i
have
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
doppelbocks
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
will
certainly
be
getting
a
few
more
bottles
in
the
future
interesting
taste
and
aroma
boozy
some
sweetness
slightly
sour
and
tart
yeastiness
lacking
the
profound
malt
flavor
i
was
seeking
a
bit
of
breadiness
but
not
nearly
enough
for
my
tastes
some
dark
fruit
raisin
and
figs
soaked
in
rum
fruitcake
spiciness
caramel
and
brown
sugar
an
interesting
beer
that
was
entirely
successful
for
me
id
try
it
again
but
not
at
the
asking
price
in
nyc
impressive
but
it
looks
flat
theres
nothing
aesthetically
pleasing
about
this
brew
this
brew
has
changed
my
views
on
doppelbocks
i
will
never
run
from
them
again
o
despite
what
may
seem
like
mixed
or
hesitant
descriptors
i
have
to
say
i
really
liked
this
beer
the
label
says
triple
bock
lager
and
i
get
it
the
beer
is
lager
thin
but
bock
dark
the
advertised
vienna
and
munich
malts
are
obviously
amazing
you
have
to
love
them
the
decoction
process
used
is
no
doubt
accountable
for
some
of
the
unique
characteristics
of
this
great
beer
as
well
nice
strong
lager
dont
really
get
much
bock
flavor
from
it
perhaps
a
touch
of
doughy
sweetness
from
the
munich
malt
over
all
a
huge
malty
brew
flavorful

o
probably
the
best
double
bock
ive
ever
had
i
think
this
is
actually
worth
the
8
9912oz
price
tag
o
overall
i
remember
this
one
being
a
bit
better
but
pretty
sure
last
time
i
had
the
2010
vintage
so
perhaps
the
heat
was
toned
down
a
bit
the
flavor
is
great
but
the
heat
is
on
glad
i
have
another
bottle
set
aside
and
will
probably
nab
a
few
more
while
these
are
around
kuhnhenn
continues
to
rock
the
house
their
big
beers
are
so
drinkable
poured
into
a
snifter
this
is
a
dark
brown
or
black
with
minimal
carbonation
smell
is
intensely
sweet
with
some
hints
of
molasses
plum
and
marshmallow
taste
is
very
sweet
with
some
roasted
graham
cracker
flavors
followed
by
a
slight
alcohol
burn
very
tasty
very
little
carbonation
alcohol
is
hidden
fairly
well
a
big
sweet
and
interesting
beer
that
lacks
appropriate
body
overall
a
huge
sipping
beer
overall
dangerously
drinkable
alcohol
is
hardly
noticeable
i
need
mo
o
a
delicious
and
clean
and
unique
brew
with
a
great
complexity
and
depth
5
the
movie
gone
was
excellent
but
maybe
the
beer
made
it
better
o
this
is
good
but
not
8
99
good
for
a
12
oz
bottle
always
a
pleasure
to
try
all
things
kuhnhenn
but
they
do
better
on
just
about
every
other
release
comparatively
i
really
like
the
kuhnhenns
brews
and
pub
it
takes
a
few
true
craft
brewers
to
concoct
these
idiocenrtrc
brews
that
are
isolated
aberitions
of
perfection
o
kind
of
hard
to
drink
due
to
the
massive
sweetness
almost
cloying
at
times
this
is
definitely
a
dessert
beer
or
one
to
share
with
a
friend
given
the
6bottle
price
i
probably
wont
be
returning
to
this
one
deep
dark
burnt
brown
and
yes
it
has
ruby
highlights
indeed
carbonation
is
apparent
from
the
bubbles
i
see
but
head
is
not
as
it
looks
still
this
is
one
opaque
beer
held
to
light
and
cant
see
through
though
it
glows
nicely
the
aroma
is
faint
but
contains
some
appropriate
scents
raisin
plum
and
brown
sugar
vanilla
and
caramel
a
truly
distinct
raisin
plum
flavor
malt
explosion
undertones
of
cocoa
are
present
as
well
some
hop
charecter
is
present
but
faint
slight
flavor
of
alcohol
and
hotness
mouthfeel
is
full
but
slick
kinda
of
oily
a
truly
tasty
brew
a
sipper
to
be
sure
more
carbonation
would
be
nice
very
german
in
style
honestly
my
least
fav
from
them
do
far
it
is
good
theyve
just
set
the
bar
high
heavy
and
rich
palate
very
fruity
raisins
berries
dates
some
nice
munich
malt
flavors
amazed
by
how
german
this
tastes
theres
no
booziness
at
all
and
it
avoids
cloying
sweetness
finishes
toasty
slightly
nutty
remarkably
clean
stuff
im
impressed
i
can
say
that
drinkability
was
very
nice
but
theres
some
definite
heat
none
of
which
affected
the
flavour
but
it
did
make
me
take
my
time
drinking
this
and
i
dont
normally
find
most
things
boozy
i
wish
i
had
got
a
couple
more
of
these
at
the
winter
solstice
but
it
may
be
around
again
o
this
is
another
solid
beer
by
kuhnhenn
honestly
do
they
make
a
bad
one
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
lagers
but
this
was
an
interesting
try
i
think
i
should
probably
check
out
some
of
their
other
less
intense
lagers
and
then
revisit
this
o
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
considering
its
strength
because
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
from
the
taste
i
had
the
wonderful
luck
to
try
this
beer
fresh
from
the
fermentation
tank
when
the
keg
was
first
tapped
and
when
it
was
half
way
through
the
initial
pours
i
had
were
phenomenal
the
munich
malts
were
so
thick
it
literally
tasted
like
a
milkshake
and
was
grayishbrown
in
color
matching
the
maltiness
weighing
in
at
13
5
abv
you
wouldnt
even
know
you
were
drinking
a
beer
unless
you
were
told
highly
recommended
being
that
this
beer
is
still
super
young
the
beer
looks
like
dirty
mud
water
coming
out
of
the
tap
looks
like
it
was
taken
from
a
swamp
a
nice
amount
of
swamp
water
head
floats
on
top
like
a
milkshake
some
stickies
it
looks
terrible
but
thats
not
the
beers
fault
its
intriging
to
say
the
least
smell
is
alot
of
sweetners
including
brown
sugar
some
caramel
raisin
and
bread
it
smells
weird
but
i
cant
stop
sniffing
it
taste
is
on
the
sweet
side
with
carameltoffee
influence
and
some
english
backbone
i
get
brown
suga
whoppers
yeast
a
splash
of
alcoholestimated
at
1214
feel
is
kinda
flat
the
body
has
not
came
together
yet
goes
down
like
milk
i
enjoyed
this
and
am
interested
what
an
aged
bottle
of
this
would
turn
into
much
better
than
that
sam
adams
creation
by
leaps
and
bounds
even
at
this
infant
stage
prost
beertracker
d
very
enjoyable
and
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
more
like
a
barleywine
then
a
doppelbock
but
who
cares
i
liked
it
probably
not
many
floating
around
but
try
if
you
can
find
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
way
better
than
the
sa
triple
bock
simply
a
great
beer
for
the
style
hardly
and
booze
shows
as
well
i
highly
recommend
this
one
bottle
pours
a
thick
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
little
to
no
head
aroma
is
lots
of
sweet
caramel
malts
fruity
raisins
a
hint
of
rum
and
a
small
hop
note
flavor
is
tons
of
molasses
plums
cognac
very
rich
and
satisfying
with
a
warming
finish
from
the
big
alcohol
thick
sticky
mouth
feel
with
minimal
carbonation
this
is
a
solid
dessert
sipper
and
probably
better
than
i
was
expecting
given
the
reputation
of
triple
bocks
sure
its
thick
and
not
extremely
drinkable
but
its
got
a
ton
of
flavor

thanks
again
for

this

2006
vintage
last
beer
i
split
with
bill
yesterday
color
is
a
deep
dark
mahogany
close
to
two
inches
of
light
tan
head
that
was
pretty
foamy
leaves
a
small
cloud
later
on
not
much
lacing
though
aroma
consists
of
port
wine
caramel
toffee
booze
raisins
dates
sweetness
and
rich
sugars
flavor
starts
off
quite
sweet
with
various
malts
sugar
and
dark
fruits
in
the
middle
finish
is
harshly
hot
with
a
big
sweet
aftertaste
that
lingers
wish
it
mellowed
out
a
little
as
it
warmed
but
that
was
not
the
case
too
strong
for
my
palate
sweet
hot
and
malty
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
good
amount
of
carbonation
taste
lingered
a
very
long
time
had
a
hard
time
getting
though
five
or
six
ounces
myself
very
strong
and
heavy
sweetness
makes
drinkability
even
worse
for
being
three
years
old
already
this
beer
still
needs
to
age
a
lot
longer
it
seems
brew
is
still
quite
hot
with
alcohol
warmth
i
will
be
the
first
to
say
this
is
much
better
than
the
only
other
triple
bock
i
have
tasted
which
is
sam
adams
would
like
to
try
this
another
three
years
down
the
road
to
see
how
it
evolves
and
mellows
worth
trying
d
the
6oz
pour
of
this
was
plenty
the
abv
is
remarkably
well
disguised
but
the
buzz
creeps
up
pretty
quickly
the
sour
offflavor
also
gets
a
bit
distracting
i
get
the
feeling
that
triple
trippel
tripple
bocks
may
be
too
extreme
even
for
me
d
considering
the
amount
of
punch
that
this
beer
packs
im
quite
surprised
and
ultimately
relieved
that
the
malts
arent
horribly
cloying
in
an
effort
to
mask
the
alcohol
when
viewed
as
a
drink
for
a
one
beer
evening
it
works
very
well
and
is
quite
enjoyable
d
this
is
the
perfect
sipper
if
your
looking
for
a
malty
treat
it
might
be
a
little
too
sweet
for
some
dark
heathens
very
impressive
ive
got
a
couple
of
small
qualms
with
the
nose
and
the
body
but
theyre
far
from
substantial
i
am
curious
as
to
where
the
damn
soy
flavor
is
in
this
one
as
a
tripple
bock
i
was
expecting
some
soy
all
kidding
aside
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
much
more
impressive
than
the
sam
adams
triple
bock
if
you
care
to
compare
the
two
definitely
recommended
if
you
can
find
one
thanks
a
ton
derek
not
sure
if
its
diecetyl
or
not
still
shows
in
the
mouth
but
isnt
offending
at
all
malty
sweet
with
hints
of
chocolate
brown
sugar
toffee
date
caramel
and
whiskey
a
nice
sipper
showing
creamy
accents
and
very
little
bitterness
on
the
moderate
finish
finishes
with
a
continual
onslaught
of
malt
extract
with
plenty
of
sharp
alcohol
notes
that
cut
through
ive
been
excited
to
try
this
beer
for
a
while
and
i
was
pretty
disappointed
with
it
it
was
way
too
sweet
for
my
liking
i
struggled
to
finish
the
glass
maybe
the
yeast
tired
out
during
the
fermentation
process
and
didnt
complete
their
job
overall
this
doppelbock
is
unbalanced
this
isnt
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
kuhnhenns
oh
well
you
win
some
you
lose
some
pours
a
somewhat
foggy
rich
mahogany
with
a
tiny
half
finger
khaki
colored
head
that
immediately
disappears
after
pour
no
lacing
left
on
the
sides
at
all
but
this
seems
to
be
pretty
common
for
this
style
smell
is
huge
caramel
malts
with
tons
of
dark
fruits
such
as
dates
plums
cherries
and
raisins
brown
sugar
emerges
as
well
with
some
hints
of
honey
for
13

there
is
no
alcohol
in
the
nose
at
all
sweet
syrupy
caramel
goodness
all
over
the
tongue
with
a
good
dose
of
molasses
a
bit
of
vanilla
comes
about
as
well
with
a
warming
alcohol
flavor
towards
the
end
very
interesting
mouthfeel
just
about
no
carbonation
at
all
with
a
huge
creamy
feel
to
it
how
they
hide
13

is
beyond
me
if
i
had
to
guess
the
abv
without
knowing
it
i
would
say
somewhere
around
78
my
first
beer
from
these
guys
and
it
wont
be
my
last

again

sampled
on

at
the
hop
devil
in
nyc
for
their
kuhnhenn
night
the
beer
poured
a
dense
brown
color
with
a
slight
tan
head
that
provided
a
nice
little
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
beer
had
a
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
slight
hint
of
the
high
abv
to
come
the
body
was
a
nice
big
punch
of
malty
sweet
caramel
honey
and
the
big
big
abv
some
of
the
other
kuhnhenn
beers
that
night
masked
the
abv
well
but
this
one
put
it
right
out
in

and
makes
for
a

aroma
with

big
kick

a
nice
sweetness
like
honey
from
the
comb
fruity
flavor
the
alcohol
was
a
little
on
the
raw
side
but
not
in
a
bad
way
the
brothers
usually
hide
the
alcohol
pretty
well
but
this
it
just
comes
right
out
there
and
grabs
you
malts
nice
sweetness
good
sippin
beers
that
you
can
enjoy
with
a
good
cigar
its
one
of
the
best
looking
german
doppels
ive
ever
seen
but
its
just
far
to
sweet
for
my
tastes
still
drinkable
but
if
you
are
into
that
thing
youll
dig
this
one
for
sure
o
a
nice
sipper
with
standout
fruit
flavorseven
for
a
doppelbock
this
is
complex
and
rich
i
will
seek
it
out
again
i
would
seek
this
one
out
again
overall
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
this
is
hard
to
find
in
ga
so
if
you
can
find
it
give
it
a
try
creamy
mouthfeel
over
all
a
very
nice
doppelbock
overall
got
to
love

overall
this
is
a
damn
nice

nicely

good

very
smooth
to
sip
on
really
enjoyable
offering
the
feel
is
likewise
light
this
could
use
just
a
touch
more
thickness
and
body
otherwise
its
pretty
smooth
overall
comparing
my
review
to
others
it
appears
i
got
a
stale
version
there
simply
was
no
carbonation
whatsoever
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
beer
locally
but
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
overall
a
middleoftheroad
doppelbock
ive
had
worse
but
as
most
others
would
probably
attest
id
prefer
a
salvator
over
this
one
if
i
can
find
this
beer
incountry
ill
post
a
comparison
review
oa
decent
doppelbock
a
little
too
much
sweetness
up
front
for
me
but
overall
not
bad
for
the
price
i
got
it
from
a
friend
for
free
not
something
i
would
search
out
in
the
future
notes
nice
doppelbock
would
make
a
very
nice
dessert
as
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
fruitcake
nice
sweet
dark
fruit
flavors
are
quite
strong
i
prefer
this
over
the
previous
example
that
i
had
theres
more
alcohol
and
it
has
a
fuller
feeling
drinkability
its
doppelbock
albeit
very
fruity
frankly
it
is
a
kick
in
the
teeth
the
trix
rabbit
would
be
envious
of
way
too
sweet
though
it
does
avoid
the
other
main
pitfall
of
doppelbocks
the
dreaded
soy
sauce
taste
not
something
i
would
get
again
spaten
and
paulaner
make
a
better
doppel
good
beer
im
happy
to
finally
see
in
my
area
yet
another
stop
in
bavaria
i
need
to
make
im
curious
what
their
local
version
is
all
about
oa
nice
beer
to
sit
back
and
sip
on
cannot
believe
they
have
been
brewing
since
1330
unreal
a
relaxing
beer
that
pairs
well
with
groundhog
day
this
one
is
comfortable
like
flannel
warm
out
of
the
dryer
overall
this
was
interesting
but
also
out
of
my
comfort
zone
from
normal
drinking
not
a
true
doppelbock
overall
it
was
worth
the
4
or
whatever
it
cost
i
know
it
wasnt
too
pricey
not
the
best
doppelbock
ive
had
but
it
holds
its
own
for
sure
great
monastery
brew
especially
since
i
have
been
there
and
tasted
the
real
stuff
fresh
from
the
wooden
keg
thin
head
on
a
murky
maroon
and
brown
body
rich
molasses
and
dark
fruit
mostly
with
a
fresh
melted
carmel
note
flavor
is
more
like
a
wild
ale
with
a
musty
dark
fruit
note
with
caramel
and
syrupy
background
medium
body
and
light
to
moderate
carbonation
overall
reminds
me
of
a
wild
ale
too
much
but
still
a
good
beer
d
comes
across
more
like
a
flemish
red
than
a
bock
but
it
is
balanced
and
enjoyable
i
like
doppelbocks
i
like
celebrator
and
maximator
a
lot
sam
adams
is
pretty
good
i
like
korbinian
well
enough
spaten
one
or
two
others
the
style
seems
like
a
nice
one
but
this
one
tasted
like
balsamic
vinegar
mixed
with
something
sweet
so
did
the
samichlaus
doppelbock
i
tried
after
that
to
a
somewhat
lesser
extent
both
were
sour
and
vinegary
do
not
like
couldnt
get
through
a
4
oz
taster
i
wonder
what
makes
these
two
come
out
like
this
o
the
9
abv
is
hidden
by
some
ancient
spell
i
suppose
the
flavors
are
complex
while
approachable
its
everything
the
stereotypical
dark
german
beer
should
be
and
then
some
overall
this
could
be
the
best
doppelbock
i
can
ever
recall
tasting
intense
malt
bill
without
being
too
sweet
especially
with
the
9abv
artfully
crafted
beautifully
made
utterly
delicious
poured
a
dark
brown
and
w
low
lighting
at
bar
almost
black
w
a
large
tan
head
that
disipates
quickly
and
left
spots
of
lace
a
good
blend
of
smells
in
the
aroma
as
i
pick
up
roasted
malts
as
well
as
raisins
and
figs
the
raisins
i
think
is
power
of
suggestion
from
the
bartender
and
some
dark
fruit
like
black
cherry
taste
is
more
complex
as
a
mediumbodied
brew
passes
over
my
tongue
remaining
smooth
almost
chewey
while
finishing
w
a
dry
snap
thanks
to
the
alcohol
flex
the
high
abv
gives
the
beer
a
warming
sensation
as
you
drink
but
doesnt
overpower
your
tongue
as
you
will
def
taste
some
sweet
sugariness
some
spiciness
and
minor
citricfloral
hopping
and
a
good
chunk
of
roasted
malts
in
there
i
found
it
very
balanced
and
it
is
a
hearty
sipper
to
relax
with
poured
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
translucent
body
transient
tan
head
fades
to
some
whisps
and
a
thin
collar
nose
of
black
licorice
molasses
big
rich
malts
and
some
generous
sweetness
i
can
already
feel
the
warmth
taste
is
rich
and
comes
across
as
almost
syrupy
initially
more
molasses
and
licorice
as
the
nose
suggests
sweet
and
sticky
throughout
lingering
sweetness
and
some
dark
fruits
come
through
on
the
backend
sweetness
is
large
and
just
borders
on
being
inhibitive
but
i
was
in
the
mood
for
this
as
i
rated
this
quite
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
content
beers
just
went
down
too
easy
that
night
which
isnt
readily
evident
good
bonewarming
stuff
an
ok
doppelbock
not
super
complex
too
alcohol
heavy
i
think
and
4
per
bottle
something
to
try
but
im
not
sure
id
get
another
given
how
many
other
tasty
varieties
are
commonly
available
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
best
dbs
that
ive
had
here
in
the
us
a
lot
of
people
dont
understand
how
this
style
should
be
its
relatively
thin
and
lacks
complexity
but
if
you
want
a
lesson
buy
this
beer
this
sample
has
some
big
spicing
that
while
thoroughly
enjoyed
i
dont
remember
the
character
in
bavaria
other
than
that
this
is
a
classic
example
of
the
style
overall
experience
its
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
probably
have
this
closer
to
the
winter
time
to
warm
up
with
but
i
feel
it
is
lacking
something
i
would
purchase
again
but
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
its
hard
to
compete
with
an
ayinger
doppelbock
overall
from
stem
to
stern
im
impressed
by
this
beer
i
think
the
whole
is
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
this
beer
is
very
well
put
together
and
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
it
again
drinkabilityoverall
really
really
great
balance
and
delicious
flavors
alcohol
is
so
hidden
this
is
a
beer
i
loved
when
i
brought
it
in
to
my
store
the
first
time
cuz
i
liked
it
years
ago
and
it
still
is
just
as
good
to
me
now
still
feel
very
confident
i
will
continue
recommending
this
beer
to
customers
and
visit
my
self
again
possibly
my
favorite
german
brew
o
i
stopped
at
this
kloster
about
4
years
ago
but
was
unable
to
sample
the
beer
there
because
it
was
a
sunday
glad
to
have
thechance
some
years
later
even
if
now
getting
a
bottle
rather
than
a
fresh
draft
well
this
bottled
beer
is
good
but
slightly
disappointing
i
still
want
to
make
a
return
visit
to
sample
the
beers
on
tap
at
the
source
you
should
too
the
monastery
is
wonderful
meanwhile
this
brew
does
taste
like
it
is
actually
from
a
recipe
from
benedictine
monks
in
1609
o
i
can
probably
count
the
dopplebocks
that
ive
had
on
two
hands
maybe
three
but
that
needs
to
change
as
i
seem
to
enjoy
each
one
more
than
the
next
this
is
a
damn
tasty
beer
that
i
will
be
picking
up
again
poured
a
14
offwhite
head
which
soon
completely
dissipated
clear
burnt
umber
brown
in
color
but
when
held
to
the
light
it
had
maroon
highlights
both
smell
and
taste
are
megamalty
the
higher
alcohol
has
a
burn
presence
plus
theres
a
slight
acidic
zing
which
gives
a
pretty
long
finish
body
was
medium
light
and
less
than
i
expected
all
in
all
a
very
tasty
rich
doppelbock
this
doppelbock
was
a
little
different
than
i
expected
it
poured
out
like
a
normal
doppelbock
with
a
really
nice
deep
amber
color
and
yellowish
white
head
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
sweet
malt
aromas
and
and
some
subtle
hops
in
the
background
the
taste
was
strange
to
me
it
gave
off
this
sour
flavor
for
some
reason
perhaps
a
bad
bottle
but
im
unsure
the
tase
i
was
getting
from
this
brew
kind
of
hindered
my
thoughts
of
what
started
out
as
a
good
looking
brew
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
had
a
light
carbonation
to
it
if
it
wasnt
for
the
taste
i
would
have
enjoyed
this
much
more
perhaps
having
it
again
would
be
a
good
choice
sampled
on
may
10
2011
it
begins
with
a
gorgeous
deep
mahogany
brownred
pour
with
an
inch
of
hed
that
settles
down
to
a
small
long
lasting
ring
and
leaves
considerable
lacing
these
aromas
are
all
over
the
place
and
quite
exceptional
with
figs
molasses
licorice
dark
fruits
and
toffee
the
body
is
medium
to
full
the
taste
has
this
voracious
sharp
raisinfiggy
sweetness
followed
by
a
dry
flavorful
hopped
finale
something
out
of
the
ordinary
o
a
superb
doppelbock
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
that
is
pretty
transparent
thin
tan
head
forms
and
then
falls
away
very
quickly
the
nose
has
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
mild
malt
sweetness
pretty
plain
mild
dark
fruits
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
really
plain
and
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
watery
for
a
beer
of
this
style
and
strength
mild
malt
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
caramel
really
bland
and
disappointing
moderate
carbonation
on
a
toolight
body
not
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
purchased
at
green
life
for
3
99
nose
is
primarily
yeast
with
some
light
chocolate
notes
pours
nearly
jet
black
with
lighter
carbonation
and
a
very
thin
whitish
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
once
it
dissipates
it
almost
looks
like
a
cola
in
my
stem
glass
the
taste
is
intense
chocolate
dark
fruits
roasted
malt
and
some
sort
of
wood
note
then
finishes
with
a
blast
of
hop
bitterness
to
cleanse
the
mouth
feel
is
very
nice
and
almost
milky
this
is
an
incredible
dopplebock
maybe
my
favorite
so
far
grade
a
purchased
at
stonys
4
99
ea
drinkability
these
go
down
surprisingly
fast
especially
for
9
0
its
not
too
sweet
or
bitter
so
i
can
put
these
down
one
after
another
with
ease
a
beer
i
enjoy
on
a
regular
basis
very
drinkable
but
not
overly
complex
a
solid
version
of
the
style
d
i
really
like
this
beer
hate
me
if
you
must
but
i
liked
it
more
than
celebrator
d
i
love
me
a
good
doppelbock
and
this
one
certainly
fit
definitely
worth
a
tick
this
is
a
pretty
solid
doppelbock
maybe
not
the
best
out
there
but
great
stuff
drinkability
this
is
a
really
good
dopplebock
one
worthy
of
a
revisit
while
there
is
no
indication
of
the
9
abv
it
is
too
sweet
to
have
good
drinkability
d
could
hit
the
spot
if
you
want
a
dunkles
but
cant
otherwise
find
one
this
beer
is
dark
brown
with
a
slight
crimson
tinge
the
cream
colored
head
dissapates
quickly
and
turns
to
a
thin
film
lacing
is
not
real
prominent
as
the
alcohol
probably
reduces
it
aromas
consist
of
dried
grains
caramel
toffee
some
chocolate
and
roasted
notes
hops
arent
real
present
on
the
nose
flavors
are
awesome
dried
dark
fruit
horsefeed
toast
caramel
and
even
a
slightly
earthy
quality
envelop
the
tongue
the
minute
this
beer
hits
it
hops
round
out
the
finish
with
a
slightly
dry
grassy
character
full
bodied
and
chewy
this
beer
has
alot
going
on
one
of
the
creamiest
doppelbocks
i
have
tasted
very
easy
to
drink
despite
its
abv
this
beer
could
be
dangerous
i
want
more
i
cant
say
better
than
celebrator
not
even
close
actually
but
still
great
and
worth
consuming
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
worth
a
purchase
if
you
see
it
d
drinking
this
beer
isnt
overly
difficult
because
the
alcohol
doesnt
prominently
stand
out
however
this
is
one
that
you
should
definitely
sip
considering
its
strength
this
is
a
perfect
beer
when
you
need
some
alcohol
warming
on
a
cold
night
but
dont
want
to
taste
the
alcohol
notes
for
me
it
was
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
and
yet
it
full
of
complexity
which
i
do
like
d
great
beer
damn
near
world
class
not
quite
on
par
with
celebrator
but
it
comes
close
tastes
great
but
not
an
exceptionally
drinkable
beer
f
long
molasses
sweetness
and
syrupy
with
brown
and
candi
sugars
some
earthy
bitterness
little
smoke
dries
well
but
keeps
that
hint
of
sweetness
dark
wheat
too
with
no
real
stickiness
caramel
toasty
malts
and
a
looong
finish
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
the
traditional
flavors
and
aromas
are
fantastic
and
it
seems
to
be
quite
well
put
together
given
the
higher
abv
and
somewhat
intense
flavors
i
may
be
sticking
to
just
a
sampling
of
this
but
it
sure
is
tasty
poured
a
nice
rich
brown
with
a
small
light
brown
head
which
was
a
bit
lacking
smell
was
extremely
malt
sweet
with
a
big
caramel
note
the
taste
was
a
bit
extreme
on
the
malt
bomb
side
of
things
barely
hinted
at
the
booze
but
became
a
bit
cloying
on
its
own
fared
much
better
with
easter
dinner
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
coated
the
mouth
felt
as
though
it
left
a
film
coating
as
stated
earlier
the
beer
was
a
bit
much
on
the
sweetness
but
paired
with
food
became
much
easier
to
handle
not
sure
if
i
would
seek
this
out
again
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
this
is
my
1st
from
this
brewery
and
klosterbetriebe
peeked
my
interest
this
may
not
be
my
favorite
dopplefar
from
it
but
its
pretty
authentic
in
style
one
thats
not
all
that
complex
at
9
this
runs
high
as
is
the
body
so
this
is
not
a
guzzling
beer
more
like
a
big
gulper
every
7
minutes
or
so
ill
try
more
from
this
brewery
in
the
future
ill
just
need
to
check
out
the
german
section
more
often
one
that
i
tend
to
overlook
alot
mmmmm
mm
gooood
beer
poured
a
beautiful
huge
tan
foamy
frothy
textured
head
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
rich
ruby
tinged
mahogoney
aroma
is
malty
and
dark
ripe
fruit
flavors
that
and
a
lot
more
pick
out
figs
dates
plums
prunes
raisins
sweet
cherries
a
little
pear
lots
of
malt
a
little
roasty
and
booze
at
the
end
body
is
very
good
as
is
the
carbonation
almost
a
session
but
ya
better
be
careful
d
not
bad
for
a
dopplebock
i
prefer
korbinian
or
celebrator
better
but
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
1226
poured
from
a
pint
bottle
to
a
glass
poured
a
dark
cloudy
brown
with
very
small
head
that
faded
very
fast
with
a
little
lacing
smells
very
sweet
and
malty
tastes
very
sweet
with
hints
of
alcohol
and
fruits
very
smooth
mouthfeel
pretty
drinkable
the
aroma
is
light
and
malty
with
a
little
caramel
the
taste
is
light
not
a
on
there
with
ok
feel
and
drinkability
d
drinkable
if
youre
into
doppelbocks
give
this
one
a
shot
overall
the
beer
is
neat
and
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
good
carry
through
and
connectivity
there
isnt
a
lot
of
sourness
from
the
carbonation
in
the
body
but
there
is
an
odd
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
there
is
some
sweetness
up
front
that
is
100
malt
followed
by
a
slight
tinge
of
alcohol
overall
drinkability
is
good
and
mouthfeel
is
good
ive
tasted
better
doppelbocks
and
this
one
has
a
couple
of
obvious
flaws
i
would
recommend
it
but
probably
wouldnt
order
it
again
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
almost
2
times
pours
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
cherryoak
highlights
had
white
colored
head
that
went
away
pretty
quickly
almost
no
lacing
on
this
beer
smell
is
good
heavy
on
malts
and
darker
fruits
like
dates
and
figs
sweet
smelling
the
taste
picks
up
where
the
smell
leaves
off
same
tastes
of
dark
fruits
and
a
big
malty
flavor
also
notes
of
roasted
barley
with
and
with
a
toffee
and
buttery
finish
could
have
been
power
of
suggestion
but
i
feel
like
you
can
taste
a
bit
of
the
alcohol
too
but
not
bad
for
being
9
the
mouthfeel
is
good
as
light
as
a
full
bodied
beer
could
be
in
my
opinion
its
smooth
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
more
of
a
sipper
though
in
my
opinion
cracked
it
open
christmas
evening
of
09
very
nice
on
a
cold
day
warmed
me
up
nice
prost
beertracker
d
delicious
no
recoil
or
unpleasantness
in
this
one
for
sure
definitely
worth
the
cost
4
25pint
in
my
case
id
definitely
recommend
checking
this
one
out
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
color
few
fingers
of
offwhite
head
that
diminishes
quickly
and
leaves
little
lacing
smell
is
of
carmel
molasses
raisin
prune
cherry
brown
sugar
taste
is
a
somewhat
oversweet
combination
of
camrmelized
sugar
and
dark
dried
fruit
mostly
raisin
the
flavors
are
all
good
but
the
sweetness
should
be
toned
down
a
notch
or
the
grain
presence
boosted
body
is
somewhat
thin
for
the
style
carbonation
could
use
a
boost
ok
beer
nothing
fantastic
but
still
flavorful
it
is
fairly
drinkable
for
a
9
abv
very
tasty
hits
the
spot
on
a
lot
of
cylinders
i
will
say
the
appearance
leaves
much
to
be
desired
with
an
unimpressive
head
and
blah
coloring
but
the
aroma
is
massive
and
enticing
and
the
flavor
is
on
par
with
the
style
and
it
lacks
the
oversweetness
that
kills
so
many
doppelbocks
highly
drinkable
due
to
its
balance
and
intangibles
drinkability
celebrator
is
still
king
this
beer
was
on
the
sweet
side
and
a
little
thin
on
the
body
for
doppelbocks
it
is
pretty
high
up
there
a
solid
one
for
this
category
i
am
itching
to
try
the
german
version
as
it
has
less
abv
pours
dark
brown
with
a
pittance
of
head
that
dissipates
to
nothing
no
lacing
or
anything
very
light
carbonation
almost
tastes
like
a
cask
ale
nose
is
full
of
heavy
malts
some
alcohols
smells
rather
strong
without
being
too
strong
taste
is
full
as
well
somewhat
malty
but
not
very
heavy
alcohols
are
a
little
bit
noticeable
also
slight
chocolate
notes
are
discernable
for
a
9
goes
down
pretty
frickin
easy
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
an
ok
beer
seems
a
bit
thin
and
lacking
in
flavor
to
my
tongue
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
pint
glass
dark
and
black
a
little
bit
of
a
head
to
it
which
felt
creamy
when
i
took
a
sip
i
picked
up
a
little
malt
when
i
smelled
the
beer
the
taste
was
wonderful
raisins
malt
a
little
roasted
character
despite
the
beer
being
9
i
didnt
notice
any
alcohol
warmth
so
be
careful
when
you
drink
it
very
easy
drinking
for
a
big
brew
too
bad
its
so
hard
to
find
and
at
a
fairly
high
price
point
additionally
its
flavor
profiles
better
stand
on
their
own
as
opposed
to
drinking
this
with
food
those
factors
make
this
beer
a
likely
try
again
but
not
for
probably
a
while
drinkability
is
good
for
a
9
abv
which
is
nonexistent
not
quite
as
good
as
the
ayinger
but
still
not
bad
d
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
dopplebock
that
is
worth
a
try
however
there
are
plenty
of
better
dopplebocks
out
there
overall
a
very
good
doppelbock
the
aromas
were
excellent
but
the
taste
was
not
as
strong
as
i
expected
i
concluded
this
was
a
good
thing
because
there
was
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
pours
a
clear
mahogany
with
a
small
tan
head
smell
is
very
interesting
almost
portlike
ripe
cherries
and
berries
and
raisins
with
an
aniselicorice
quality
that
is
very
intriguing
fascinating
on
the
nose
all
of
these
aromas
carry
through
to
the
flavor
which
is
quite
sweet
and
brown
sugary
its
very
good
but
might
be
too
sweet
for
such
a
large
bottle
id
be
content
to
just
have
half
this
much
drinkability
yuck
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
there
are
still
others
that
i
would
take
over
it
but
i
think
i
might
be
getting
this
one
again
sometime
got
this
beer
at
ye
olde
forge
in
lanesboro
ma
served
in
a
small
challace
the
appearance
was
dark
amber
the
smell
was
that
of
a
higher
alcohol
content
beer
with
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
the
taste
was
smooth
and
crisp
this
was
a
good
yet
pricey
beer
d
a
wellhidden
whopper
at
9
a
nice
beer
for
a
cold
night
curator
might
be
the
biggest
abv
german
beer
ive
ever
had
that
wont
make
any
beer
an
automatic
winner
but
in
this
case
the
higher
alcohol
highlights
a
recipe
thats
apparently
generous
with
the
ingredients
and
wouldnt
you
know
with
all
that
flavor
i
hardly
noticed
the
alcohol
which
is
merely
a
bit
player
in
the
flavor
big
malts
rule
here
its
complexity
and
depth
make
this
a
musttry
for
any
fan
of
german
beers
no
matter
the
style
das
ist
ein
zehr
gutes
bier
overall
an
excellent
though
potent
doppelbockbier
this
one
was
decent
but
im
not
very
impressed
better
dopples
out
there
cheers
this
is
a
nice
beer
though
i
cant
say
it
wowed
me
nevertheless
it
was
fun
to
try
especially
on
draft
d
moderate
with
the
high
alcohol
but
this
is
worth
keeping
around
poured

for

what

there
just
doesnt

any

drinkability
not
bad
but
i
would
probably
chose
other
double
bocks
if
given
the
choice
drinkablility
pretty
good
have
had
beeter
bocks
then
this
i
have
had
2
and
3
drinkability
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
ive
tasted
some
go
too
strong
some
go
too
complex
some
are
just
too
thin
this
is
very
direct
and
very
drinkable
without
becoming
strong
or
heavy
on
the
palate
worth
seeking
out
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
really
am
digging
it
i
normally
dont
buy
dopplebocks
that
much
even
though
i
love
german
lagers
this
one
is
way
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
d
this
is
a
very
good
dopplebock
despite
a
fairly
high
abv
the

isnt
noticeable

keeping
the
cloying
tendencies
in
check
this
beer
ranks
among
the
better
doppelbocks
out
there
not
bad
the
taste
is
over
the
top
lots
of
caramel
lots
of
malt
lots
of
sweet
but
overall
this
is
a
really
fine
tasting
rich
beer
the
abv
is
rather
high
but
that
is
ok
with
me
as
i
savor
this
brew
it
becomes
even
better
this
is
a
rather
new
offering
to
our
area
and
i
will
seek
this
out
again
i
try
lots
of
beer
but
not
that
many
stay
on
my
keeper
list
drinkability
dangerously
so
given
the
alcohol
im
not
always
the
biggest
fan
of
dopplebocks
but
this
one
is
really
quite
nice
for
the
style
alas
i
am
stuck
with
uberraisin
juice
the
aroma
is
a
little
more
dynamic
d
a
great
beer
maybe
not
quite
as
good
as
some
of
the
doppelbocks
on
the
ba
top
100
but
as
far
as
im
concerned
its
at
least
in
the
ballpark
recommended
a
unique
dynamic
doppelbock
in
terms
of
aroma
flavors
and
body
not
a
lager
i
could
drink
all
night
but
one
of
the
more
interesting
german
doppelbocks
available
it
is
characterized
by
a
nice
hop
balance
with
the
sweet
malt
it
is
obvious
to
me
that
this
one
is
brewed
with
loving
care
the
balance
is
just
right
and
the
9
abv
is
fairly
well
masked
old
world
understatement
melds
with
pure
epicurean
delight
keep
this
one
d
this
one
is
a
little
too
sweet
and
not
quite
complex
enough
imo
its
a
good
dessert
beer
though
d
all
in
all
quite
disappointing
watery
comes
to
mind
to
describe
it
the
mild
carbonation
of
a
typical
dopple
but
the
lighter
body
of
perhaps
even
a
substandard
lager
while
it
performs
better
than
some
of
the
beers
out
there
its
not
up
to
par
for
its
class
sorry
ettaler
i
hoped
and
expected
for
more
what
a
tasty
totally
rich
satiating
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
while
the
lack
of
that
tca
like
component
would
have
made
this
perfection
in
a
glass
it
still
does
not
hurt
it
enough
to
make
this
less
that
incredible
this
is
exactly
what
i
have
been
looking
for
in
a
doppelbock
lately
if
you
are
a
malt
lover
you
have
got
to
try
this
beer
it
will
totally
satisfy
any
malt
cravings
you
may
have
from
teh
coop
in
belfast
pours
a
nice
mahogany
brown
very
little
head
on
the
beer
that
fades
quickly
smells
like
very
sweet
malt
tastes
like
malt
dried
fruit
but
not
very
overwhelmingly
sweet
like
other
dopplebocks
ive
had
before
alcohol
well
hidden
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
overall
a
really
nice
beer
and
for
a
nice
price
of
2
99
i
recommend
single
bottle
from
grapes
hops
overall
not
at
bad
dopplebock
by
any
means
this
was
really
a
good
choice
and
something
that
was
really
cool
to
enjoy
i
really
look
forward
to
trying
it
again
pours
chestnut
with
little
head
and
no
lacing
the
beer
smells
strongly
of
molasses
burnt
sugar
and
with
whiffs
of
yeast
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
super
malty
slightly
spicy
sweet
more
molasses
but
there
is
also
some
bitterness
on
the
finish
for
balance
moutfeel
is
slightly
slick
otherwise
fairly
smooth
and
drinkable
not
my
absolut
favorite
dopplebock
and
a
little
out
of
balance
too
sweet
but
worth
a
try
i
would
drink
this
again
d
not
my
favorite
doppelbock
but
better
than
the
average
at
least
those
ive
tried
gets
a
bit
heavy
in
the
finish
one
is
more
than
enough
also
the
oddness
of
the
earthy
and
weird
saltyfishytaste
to
me
make
this
a
version
id
try
again
but
maybe
wouldnt
rush
back
to
bottled
version
same
with
a
slight
better
head
to
start
off
with
though
it
does
disappear
not
unusual
for
high
abv
drinkability
decent
but
not
overly
exciting
alcohol
levels
are
warming
as
the
glass
is
drained
worth
a
try
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
tan
head
and
patchy
lacing
the
aroma
is
bready
malt
and
fruit
mediumbodied
and
creamy
with
roasted
malt
fruit
raisins
and
caramel
flavors
the
finish
is
tart
and
fruity
with
touches
of
malt
a
decent
enough
beer
although
it
doesnt
really
fit
into
the
doppelbock
flavor
profile
that
i
prefer
drinkability
i
may
not
remember
much
but
i
will
never
forget
the
time
i
shared
an
ettaler
curator
with
my
pal
andobrew
da
bit
unbalanced
for
me
not
my
favorite
dopplebock
i
personally
like
a
bit
more
body
and
rounded
sweetness
a
very
attractive
dark
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
stiff
creamy
beige
cap
that
slowly
fades
but
does
maintain
a
nice
surface
layer
to
the
bottom
and
some
descent
lacing
rich
nose
of
molasses
dark
malts
plum
and
slight
hoppy
ester
medium
to
full
body
and
a
thin
mouthfeel
roasted
malts
burnt
sugar
sweetness
fruity
tartness
like
cranberry
towards
the
end
but
is
with
a
cocoa
powder
bitterness
some
hop
resins
at
play
but
very
much
complimentary
balanced
very
well
as
it
warms
it
becomes
a
little
more
earthy
caramel
notes
develop
and
the
cocoa
moves
closer
to
carob
flavor
the
finish
has
a
burnt
malt
burnt
brown
sugar
and
cocoa
warmth
drinkability
well
its
touch
to
sweet
for
me
and
the
9
hits
you
if
you
drink
it
to
quickly
still
a
bit
enjoyable
as
long
as
its
not
in
excess
this
is
a
delicious
dopplebock
and
carries
enough
uniqueness
to
make
it
a
must
find
even
if
your
not
a
normal
fan
of
the
style
though
i
am
and
found
this
absolutely
entrancing
drinkability
is
good
enjoyable
enough
but
would
i
buy
again
ehh
probably
not
as
there
are
better
options
out
there
but
worth
a
try
yes
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
a
nice
combination
of
a
strong
lager
big
taste
of
a
high
alcohol
beer
but
the
smoothness
and
blended
character
of
a
lager
enjoy
drinkable
nope
it
could
be
so
good
if
it
was
cut
or
cooked
overall
pretty
dam
good
but
not
an
everyday
drinker
for
sure
9
you
gotta
be
kiddin
me
the
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
this
brew
is
very
very
dangerously
drinkable
the
first
time
i
have
had
this
brew
and
while
i
dont
think
its
on
par
with
celebrator
it
is
still
enjoyable
and
one
i
will
certainly
be
tempted
to
purchase
again
drank
very
easy
for
the
abv
a
solid
dopplebock
i
will
say
i
enjoyed
the
7
0
abv
german
version
just
as
much
if
not
more
i
dont
know
that
i
would
say
this
is
the
holy
grail
of
the
style
but
its
a
good
combination
of
preserving
the
style
and
putting
an
individual
touch
on
a
dopplebock
a
good
beer
that
i
would
recommend
pours
a
clear
dark
chestnut
body
with
a
generous
beige

hangs
around
forever

taste

malty
waves
of
toffee
brown
sugar
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
notes
of
port
and
what
seems
like
fruity
hops
add
a
nice
complexity
very
little
hop
bitterness
alcohol
is
hidden
quite
well
not
as
heavy
as
anticipated
and
much
more
drinkable
a
very
nice
german
doppelbock
oelergud
aperitif
dark
auburn
red
and
clear
with
almost
no

the
smell
is
delicious
sweet

very
similar
to
salvator
so
good
the
taste
is
the
same
very
sweet
and
malty
rich
with
a
thick
mouthfeel
to
coat
as
it
goes
down
this
is
an
authentic
german
doppelbock

you
could
do
a

worse

for
a
500ml
bottle
from
tulleys
beer
wine
wells
me
i
cant
say
better
than
salavator
and
definitively
not
better
than
celebrator
i
try
not
to
compare
beers
in
reviews
but
the
new
york
times
brought
this
on
dthis
is
one
of
my
favourite
beers
so
far
i
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
this
brewery
but
unfortunately
i
have
only
had
this
and
the
helles
both
are
a
home
run
out
of
the
park
and
cant
be
beat
for
the
price
wow
this
was
very
intensley
malty
with
tons
of
caramel
and
full
breaded
maltiness
but
its
not
overly
cloying
or
too
full
bodied
there
was
also
a
note
of
sassafras
that
almost
made
this
beer
taste
like
root
beer
if
it
only
had
sugar
and
vanilla
lots
of
rummy
burnt
fruit
in
the
nose
and
on
the
tongue
finishes
malty
sweet
and
warm
i
was
kinda
freaked
out
at
the
bar
blown
away
by
the
best
damn
doppelbock
i
have
ever
had
this
side
of
ayinger
celebrator
drinkability
the
only
problem
i
had
with
this
beer
is
that
its
too
easily
drinkable
and
the
bottle
doesnt
last
long
before
i
knew
it
the
whole
bottle
was
gone
even
then
i
still
didnt
feel
the
alcohol
content
where
did
the
whole
bottle
go
so
fast
i
guess
i
drank
the
whole
bottle
in
a
matter
of
a
few
minutes
it
left
me
wanting
more
would
i
buy
another
bottle
i
sure
as
hell
would
if
i
could
ever
find
another
bottle
again
bottle
into
snifter
a
deep
brown
light
colored
head
that
went
down
pretty
quickly
s
very
malty
some
dark
fruits
and
caramel
t
chocolate
and
coffee
some
berries
and
honey
with
a
very
slight
bitterness
toward
the
end
the
alcohol
is
nearly
imperceptible
which
is
amazing
being
that
its
9
m
very
thick
sticky
not
much
carbonation
d
a
very
well
balanced
beer
nicely
subtle
for
a
dopplebock
this
is
called
the
american
version
of
the
beer
ive
never
tried
the
german
version
but
i
cant
imagine
it
being
much
better
than
this
one
it
pours
a
typical
doppelbock
color
resembles
a
rootbeer
with
a
pure
white
head
that
lingered
throughout
the
glass
the
taste
was
malty
and
delicious
with
very
little
aftertaste
the
high
alcohol
content
isnt
noticable
i
thought
that
this
was
a
6
57
alcohol
beer
and
was
very
surprised
to
discover
that
this
had
9
ive
never
had
a
beer
this
powerful
that
was
this
drinkable
i
fully
recommend
this
beer
nice
chewy
mouthfeel
introduces
this
sweet
malt
explosion
notes
of
caramel
apples
combine
with
what
i
can
only
describe
as
plum
pudding
a
combo
of
raisins
from
the
malts
and
bread
imparted
by
the
yeast
alcohol
makes
itself
known
by
the
third
or
fourth
sip
and
warms
throughout
as
imbibing
continues
this
is
a
nice
dopplebock
though
not
the
best
available
taste
is
dry
but
drinkable
and
does
a
great
job
of
hiding
the
alcohol
some
fruitiness
to
follow
the
heavy
dark
malts
and
a
bit
of
smokiness
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
smooth
this
has
got
some
balls
to
it
at
18
proof
but
goes
down
fairly
easy
and
id
drink
two
or
three
at
a
time
if
i
had
them
available
this
is
an
above
average
doppler
and
worth
looking
out
for
chilled
and
poured
into
small
pilsner
glass
the
head
rose
and
fell
lingers
about
a
centimeter
off
the
surface
with
off
white
foam
the
body
is
dark
mahogany
with
warm
brownish
red
highlights
around
the
edges
smell
is
fruity
and
aromatic
notes
of
barley
hay
rum
or
brandy
soaked
spiced
fruitcake
with
some
dark
fruits
like
plums
rasin
candied
cherries
and
nuts
i
also
get
notes
of
chocolate
hints
of
cinnamon
and
caramel
the
whole
thing
reminds
me
of
a
fruity
bunt
cake
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
lots
of
richness
very
chewy
mouth
feel
nice
helping
of
caramel
notes
rich
malty
chocolate
flavor
balanced
with
generous
hop
bitterness
alcohol
is
present
in
the
taste
but
not
a
deterrent
especially
in
the
light
of
the
rum
cake
character
personally
the
bottle
is
enough
for
me
i
doubt
i
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
brew
however
id
personally
prefer
a
slightly
more
complex
yet
alcohol
subdued
doppelbock
like
celebrator
all
the
same
this
a
good
representation
of
a
doppelbock
well
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
could
compare
it
to
its
european
counter
part
id
be
interested
to
see
how
much
this
one
differs
from
the
original
german
curator
guess
i
have
to
go
to
germany
to
find
out
poured
a
deep
amber
yet
not
quite
brown
with
a
decent
head
that
diminished
into
a
ring
that
lasted
but
left
no
lacing
aroma
was
very
malty
with
some
dried
fruit
and
maple
present
taste
was
very
reminiscent
of
maple
syrup
some
caramel
malts
and
dried
fruit
show
up
as
well
there
is
a
good
level
of
carbonation
and
nice
alcohol
warmth
in
the
mouthfeel
while
this
isnt
at
the
top
of
my
list
when
it
comes
to
dopplebocks
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
this
beer
is
respectable
though
on
the
boring
side
malt
flavors
are
lacking
and
the
fermentation
flavors
could
be
tamed
a
bit
more
the
bitterness
was
pretty
cool
but
was
not
enough
to
make
me
want
to
import
this
one
again
notes
this
doesnt
stack
up
against
most
dopples
ive
had
in
my
time
i
feel
that
im
being
generous
giving
it
a
3
range
but
the
lack
of
anything
offensive
it
has
to
be
at
least
decent
im
trying
to
find
faults
with
this
beer
and
really
am
having
a
hard
time
its
just
a
super
tasty
rich
german
dopplebock
easy
to
drink
and
delicious
i
now
can
see
why
our
friend
buys
it
by
the
case
if
i
had
the
means
i
might
join
him
very
much
recommend
to
the
maltfiend
drinkable
with
complex
flavors
and
aromas

to
a

and
im
pleased
that
its

with
an
almost
dry
feel
goes
down
very
easily
wow
goes
right
down
despite
the
alcohol
doesnt
it
very
drinkable
stuff
the
doppelbock
is
making
my
winter
very
thick
in
body
and
it
lacks
the
crispness
of
most
lagers
which
might
stand
to
increase
the
drinkability
a
bit
even
despite
the
cloying
caramel
sweetness
quite
nice
overall
though
i
dont
often
drink
doppelbock
so
i
may
not
revisit
any
time
soon
its
good
and
like
most
of
the
genre
delivers
a
nice
crisp
spiced
mirror
to
the
malts
sugars
not
a
boring
beer
by
any
means
but
not
in
the
league
of
a
aventinus
nice
thing
is
that
i
think
this
could
be
both
a
winter
and
summer
beer
which
is
not
easy
id
certainly
drink
it
again
pours
a
ruddy
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
carbonation
is
active
and
tinybubbled
releasing
a
bouquet
of
roasted
malts
and
toasted
walnuts
not
much
in
the
way
of
fruits
taste
is
malty
but
the
bitterness
of
the
walnut
that
was
in
the
nose
comes
through
in
the
taste
this
might
be
a
welcome
and
interesting
flavor
for
some
but
i
am
not
a
bitter
nut
fan
the
mouthfeel
starts
off
fine
but
the
oils
in
the
finish
thin
this
out
too
much
good
but
not
great
one
or
two
at
most
is
plenty
certainly
affordable
though
my
500ml
bottle
was
2
50
poured
beer
into
tumbler
at
50
degrees
beer
had
a
nice
brown
head
that
smelled
slightly
nutty
very
dark
beer
tasted
great
with
my
tbone
it
was
a
good
blend
of
toasted
chocolatecoffee
taste
with
a
hint
of
nuttyness
after
taste
was
harxsh
though
and
i
attribute
that
to
the
high
alc
content
it
kinda
blew
away
the
great
taste
i
would
buy
again
though
mouthfeeldrinkability
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
full
bodied
with
a
fairly
low
carbonation
and
the
drinkability
is
good
especially
since
i
cant
detect
any
alcohol
other
than
a
slight
warming
in
my
stomach
i
hope
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
german
doppelbock
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
trying
others
like
it
pours
a
clear
but
dark
and
intense
redbrown
has
a
big
foamy
tan
head
the
nose
is
sweet
apple
maybe
some
grapes
and
some
spice
coming
through
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
soft
and
complex
with
a
nice
bready
maltiness
a
gentle
plum
sweetness
and
an
interesting
smoky
flavor
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden

good
with
a
nice
carbonation

celebrator
ettaler
curator
dunkler
doppelbock
is
fantastic
and
should
be
enjoyed
by
lovers
of
quality
doppelbocks
and
by
most
others
as
well
the
fact
that
the
recipe
was
created
by
benedictine
monks
in
1609
proves
that
good
beer
is
timeless
aroma
is
quite
malty
with
a
good
bit
of
caramelly
notes
in
the
nose
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
caramel
pudding
taste
is
quite
malty
with
a
good
bit
of
toasty
malt
flavors
and
spicy
clovy
hops
in
the
finish
as
the
beer
warmed
i
could
also
taste
a
good
bit
of
molasses
along
with
some
burnt
malt
flavor
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
bodied
hard
to
believe
this
beer
is
9
cause
i
sure
as
hell
cant
taste
it
drinkability
is
good
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
ive
had
better
doppelbocks
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
and
not
expensive
at
all
in
my
area
overall
not
bad
not
really
on
par
with
celebrator
imo
but
a
good
backup
to
seek
out
when
craving
a
doppelbock
the
drinkability
is
good
no
defects
in
this
robust
db
offering
prosit
mk
the
real
mccoy
of
a
german
beer
licorice
some
roast
barley
mollasses
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
well
balanced
very
smooth
drink
despite
slightly
noticeable
but
not
obstrucive
alcohol
picked
up
in
orlando
thanks
to
the
stores
website
alerted
me
to
look
out
for
it
i
was
a
bit
stupefied
by
this
being
denoted
as
us
import
version
on
this
site
i
wasnt
aware
that
there
would
be
two
different
brews
for
special
imports
nonetheless
this
beer
pours
with
a
deep
deep
red
color
thats
translucent
only
when
held
up
to
a
bright
light
smell
is
deep
and
malty
mostly
of
the
dark
kind
taste
is
terrific
and
heavy
with
nothing
really
developing
until
about
half
way
through
the
trip
down
then
it
really
bursting
with
malty
goodness
1
pint
9
fluid
ounce
brown
bottle
without
freshness
dating
poured
clear
mahogany
with
no
head
or
lace
whatsoever
sugary
molasses
caramel
a
touch
of
burnt
toast
clove
and
alcohol
in
the
nose
very
clean
but
nearly
empty
of
flavor
slightly
sweet
syrupy
malts
up
front
with
hot
fusel
alcohol
finish
almost
still
oily
and
syrupy
body
not
a
beer
ill
revisit
the
aroma
is
ok
but
the
flavor
is
almost
entirely
missing
apart
from
the
overstrong
alcohol
this
is
a
decent
enough
dopple
but
its
rought
around
the
edges
a
little
unpleasant
at
times
kinda
like
salvator
ill
stick
with
my
korbinian
which
seems
to
be
the
smoothest
dopple
ive
had
the
palate
was
nice
and
warm
but
not
too
sweet
to
cloy
the
taste
buds
other
notes
carbonation
ran
out
before
i
could
finish
the
beer
the
beer
is
quite
light
for
a
doppelbock
i
would
expect
that
it
would
be
more
dry
or
more
rich
but
it
just
sat
in
the
middle
the
recipe
is
supposed
to
be
from
1609
so
i
guess
if
they
called
it
a
doppelbock
back
then
they
are
grandfathered
in
on
the
convention
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
i
just
wasnt
expecting
what
i
got
it
does
go
great
with
a
good
sausage
though
also
this
beer
doesnt
seem
quite
at
9
alcohol
poured
out
into
a
flute
this
was
quite
dark
in
color
and
had
a
two
finger
head
at
first
the
head
faded
quickly
to
a
very
thin
ring
of
bubbles
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
as
can
be
expected
with
a
9
abv
beer
there
was
not
much
lacing
the
aroma
was
very
rich
with
the
dark
munich
style
malts
allowed
to
emit
a
toasty
sweet
smell
the
taste
was
also
sweet
but
not
cloying
the
dark
fruit
ester
taste
was
very
dominant
here
and
was
followed
shortly
by
a
spicy
phenolic
kick
although
they
did
not
use
any
malted
wheat
in
this
recipe
this
was
somewhat
similar
to
a
weizenbock
this
was
quite
an
easy
beer
to
drink
considering
all
the
complexity
and
strength
no
wonder
this
abbeybrewery
has
been
around
since
1330
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
some
reddish
hue
with
fluffy
offwhite
one
finger
headfirst
thing
that
stuck
out
to
me
in
the
nose
was
the
smokiness
that
goes
along
with
the
dark
fruit
and
brown
sugar
and
caramel
sweetness
the
alcohol
whafted
a
little
but
its
not
strong
sweet
up
front
quite
sweet
in
fact
raisins
and
caramel
with
some
dark
brown
sugar
as
well
a
little
bit
of
an
alcohol
burn
going
down
i
notice
just
a
slight
spiciness
and
earthy
note
in
the
finishits
a
smoothslick
doppelbock
glides
down
easily
if
you
like
big
malty
sweet
beers
to
me
this
would
be
a
good
winter
sipper
to
take
the
chill
off
i
ll
be
looking
for
this
again
come
december
i
think
d
very
good
drinking
beer
which
hid
the
alcohol
well
i
will
drink
this
beer
again
in
the
future
a
good
but
not
a
great
db
it
actually
reminds
me
more
of
mahrs
weihnachtsboock
than
any
regular
db
maroonred
when
held
to
light
the
head
is
full
and
thick
off
white
the
body
is
crystal
clear
with
only
a
couple
bubbles
of
carbonation
smell
is
sweet
very
sweet
with
brown
sugar
and
a
little
banana
fruitiness
alcohol
is
evident
makes
it
a
little
spicy
smooth
and
subtle
up
front
many
earthy
and
spicey
flavors
reveal
themselves
sweetness
is
carmel
and
molasses
and
a
strong
shot
of
alcohol
a
little
cloying
as
you
keep
drinking
not
sessionable
at
all
but
has
a
nice
moderatetothick
mouthfeel
and
is
not
a
bad
beer
not
a
bad
price
though
and
certainly
a
beer
worth
a
try
body
is
nearly
medium
and
needs
a
little
addeed
oomph
to
support
the
chewy
malt
structure
and
bittersweet
complexity
carbonation
is
easy
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
slick
almost
sticky
texture
16
9
ounce

drinkable
and
then
some
only
a
slight
hint
of
warmth
after
a
while
begins
to
settle
in
as
ya
go
and
tends
to
slow
it
down
but
for
a
doppelbock
this
is
very
solid
and
a
showcase
of
the
style
import
version
or
not
me
likey
yum
pours
dark
brown
with
a
tenacious
tan
head
smells
of
sugared
prunes
cloves
molasses
and
raw
alcohol
the
alcohol
aroma
is
quite
strong
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
sweet
first
off
with
a
twinge
of
sourness
and
then
bitterness
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
finely
carbonated
and
smooth
overall
ettalers
new
entry
in
the
u
s
beer
market
is
smooth
and
flavorful
and
a
worthy
entry
in
the
doppelbock
genre
but
its
not
going
to
unseat
big
boys
in
this
style
drinkablility
good
this
is
a
good
dopplebock
nothing
more
nothing
less
enjoyable
and
one
id
gladly
have
again
sometime
a
slick
and
delicious
doppel
smooth
and
very
welcome
yum
a
classic
dop
flavor
for
sure
the
alcohol
is
not
hidden
here
too
much
but
this
is
so
tasty
you
may
just
overlook
it
very
tasty
glad
i
picked
up
a
bunch
of
them
i
havent
had
it
since
then
until
now
in
june
2008
i
wiped
out
my
old
review
and
replaced
it
with
this
one
this
new
bottle
tastes
much
more
like
a
traditional
doppelbock
than
what
i
found
back
then
im
not
sure
if
the
difference
is
with
me
or
with
this
bottle
whatever
the
case
i
like
this
bottle
quite
a
bit
better
this
brew
still
pours
with
almost
no
head
but
the
aroma
is
nice
it
smells
sweet
with
a
dark
dried
fruit
aroma
the
taste
further
expands
on
the
aroma
the
body
is
quite
heavy
and
theres
very
little
carbonation
theres
a
slight
spiciness
but
otherwise
it
tastes
of
longboiled
toffeemelanoidin
malts
and
dark
stewed
fruit
this
beer
definitely
has
that
special
german
bock
character
which
rarely
seems
to
find
its
way
into
bock
beers
produced
in
other
countries
it
has
that
lovely
dark
malty
flavor
but
without
a
roasted
character
which
you
sometimes
find
in
other
inferior
nongerman
bock
beers
this
curator
is
the
real
deal
add
some
more
carbonation
and
this
dbock
might
be
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
bocks
pours
a
very
dark
brown
kind
of
reddish
dark
brown
smell
is
toffee
with
some
hints
of
caramel
and
coffee
taste
is
of
roasted
coffee
smooth
flavor
easy
drink
but
not
an
overly
complex
flavor
maybe
you
should
use
bottle
dating
overall
a
fine
beer
but
the
lack
of
sweetness
on
the
palate
with
refreshing
quality
pushes
it
more
towards
the
taste
profile
of
a
porter
than
a
dopplebock
to
me
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
nice
pleasant
rich
malt
aroma
a
bit
nutty
same
with
the
taste
smooth
and
nice
flavor
but
onenote
not
overly
complex
easy
to
drink
for
a
stronger
beer
on
the
thicker
side
low
to
medium
carbonation
level
overall
it
kind
of
tasted
like
the
porter
i
had
from
them
but
it
should
have
been
a
bock
lower
score
since
its
no
on
par
with
the
style
i
know
this
beer
strays
from
typical
dopplebock
and
leans
on
the
porter
side
but
as
a
beer
goes
without
trying
to
compare
what
it
should
be
the
flavor
is
tasty
and
probably
my
faviorate
beer
from
thomas
creek
definitly
one
i
will
go
back
to
and
reccomend
for
more
open
minded
less
cynical
beer
drinkers
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
not
all

and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
a
very
enjoyable
offering
poured
from

bottle
into

glass
nice
dark

black
color
with
a

fingered

head
that
stayed
for
a
while
laced
well
on
the
glass
aroma
held
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
hints
taste
went
the
same
way
with
some
coffee
in
the
back
ground
as
well
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
it
goes
well
with
dinner
as
it
drinks
like
a
food
course
rich
and
full
flavored
for
sure
overall
a
nice
brew
and
i
would
try
others
from
this
brand
if
you
like
stouts
and
porters
youll
enjoy
this
for
what
it
is
this
beer
pours
up
an
absolutely
beautiful
obsidian
black
with
a
lucious
2
finger
foamy
caramel
colored
head
great
retention
and
awesome
lacing
and
right
there
the
awesomeness
ends
the
nose
especially
as
it
warms
is
malt
and
alcohol
at
6
25
the
odor
of
alcohol
just
shouldnt
be
present
taste
is
more
like
a
porter
with
some
roasted
nut
notes
and
malt
the
finish
is
a
sort
of
burnt
coffee
flavor
mouthfeel
is
sort
of
thin
but
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
i
wouldnt
refuse
one
of
these
but
neither
would
i
search
one
out
good
solid
beer
i
wont
go
out
on
a
limb
but
i
think
the
south
makes
a
totally
different
doppelbock
from
the
north
nicely
put
together
brew
will
try
several
more
times
probably
the
beer
pours
a
deep
red
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
fairly
sweet
and
has
a
lot
of
toffee
and
dark
fruit
notes
the
flavor
is
similar
with
some
toffee
and
lightly
roasted
malt
standing
out
the
most
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
coffee
the
beer
is
very
dry
overall
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
perhaps
a
little
hoppier
and
less
full
bodied
than
youd
want
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
nonetheless
not
up
there
with
the
top
examples
of
the
style
but
deserving
in
my
opinion
of
a
higher
rating
than
the
one
the
ba
community
has
bestowed
upon
it
o
pretty
good
example
of
an
american
dopplebock
but
disappointing
given
the
outstanding
brewery
that
produced
this
an
okay
doppelbock
not
the
worst
not
the
best
has
a
strange
mixture
of
smoke
and
sweet
candy
flavors
that
doesnt
sit
well
with
me
o
this
was
clean
and
well
made
overall
i
just
wasnt
quite
big
enough
imo
pours
a
very
dark
copper
thin
head
thats
gone
almost
immediately
smells
of
toasted
malt
and
light
chocolate
a
bit
too
highly
carbonated
this
gets
in
the
way
of
getting
a
good
taste
right
up
front
the
taste
is
of
heavily
roasted
malt
but
the
finish
is
watery
nothing
special
as
this
beer
warms
the
flavors
become
something
more
akin
to
a
traditional
doppelbock
at
first
it
was
more
like
a
porter
meets
lager
but
after
a
little
while
its
a
very
delicious
doppelbock
this
is
a
great
beer
and
another
home
run
for
thomas
creek
i
had
a
sample
of
this
on
tap
at
brewgrass
and
this
bottle
isnt
what
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
still
if
you
have
dicey
capping
procedures
i
reckon
ill
let
the
review
stand
for
the
time
being
i
liked
the
sample
i
had
so
i
intend
to
give
this
one
another
shake
o
a
pretty
solid
beer
from
thomas
creek
i
wouldnt
pay
a
whole
lot
for
it
but
that
being
said
i
would
definitely
make
this
a
session
beer
i
think
its
tasty
smooth
and
incredibly
drinkable
3
5
medium
bodied
with
a
balance
of
sweet
and
smokey
malts
along
with
some
zesty
spice
and
bitter
hops
slightly
acrid
and
dry
with
lots
of
deep
roasted
malt
hints
of
burnt
coffee
bean
toast
and
dark
chocolate
along
with
some
caramel
toffee
and
peppery
spice
the
abv
is
well
balanced
but
its
a
bit
harsh
and
one
dimensional
could
use
some
balance
with
more
sweetness
again
doesnt
really
taste
like
a
typical
dopplebock
i
was
more
into
this
brewerys
double
ipa
up
the
creek
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
from
the
bottle
deep
brown
velvety
pour
with
chocolate
and
vanilla
aromas
milling
off
the
head
with
a
slight
touch
of
molasses
and
caramel
sweetness
smoothed
out
body
enhances
a
sugary
sweetness
to
the
beer
which
is
offset
somewhat
by
a
subtle
dusty
woody
touch
overall
this
brew
has
a
nice
dash
of
drinkability
and
deep
complexity
a
soso
example
light
on
the
alcohol
light
on
the
body
no
really
true
to
style
in
many
ways
good
malt
forward
beer
just
not
up
to
doppelbock
strength
do
drinkability
is
pretty
low
i
hate
to
say
this
because
the
first
moments
of
this
beer
are
highly
enjoyable
but
the
sudden
drop
off
really
hurts
it
if
it
could
sustain
the
momentum
that
the
initial
taste
delivers
this
would
be
a
nice
doppelbock
for
sure
but
the
way
i
view
it
now
is
as
something
that
could
have
been
this
is
actually
a
pretty
darn
good
doppelbock
the
flavor
is
not
traditional
but
its
very
nice
and
fairly
complex
definitely
a
good
beer
recommended
the
beer
appeared
a
darker
color
perhaps
it
was
brown
and
a
thin
white
head
sat
on
tap
that
was
not
all
that
well
retained
the
aroma
was
weak
light
roasted
malts
not
much
else
the
taste
was
not
that
impressive
again
some
roasted
malts
and
a
touch
of
wood
the
beer
had
a
light
feel
to
it
high
on
the
carbonation
i
didnt
even
finish
the
whole
pint
overall
a
pretty
weak
beer
all
the
way
around
and
one
that
i
will
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
also
had
this
on
tap
at
the
liberty
in
greenville
i
think
i
like
the
bottled
version
better
i
have
not
been
impressed
with
any
of
the
thomas
creek
brews
ive
tried
o
it
seemed
like
a
lonely
station
at
beertopia
so
i
went
over
there
to
taste
something
after
tasting
it
and
i
dont
mean
this
as
a
put
down
but
i
can
see
why
they
were
a
little
lonely
nothing
great
tasted
okay
probably
wouldnt
order
though
in
a
bar
all
in
all
not
the
best
doppelbock
i
have
ever
had
but
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
could
use
a
little
more
roasted
malt
and
a
little
less
of
the
little
green
cones
in
my
opinion
thomas
creek
uses
the
right
malts
in
deep
water
dopplebock
they
just
dont
use
enough
of
them
theres
some
potential
in
this
offering
but
it
needs
to
be
fleshed
out
in
a
major
way
oh
well
a
buck
and
change
for
the
single
isnt
going
to
break
the
bank
this
dopplebock
was
very
different
than
others
i
had
become
accustomed
to
none
of
the
sweetness
or
depth
of
flavor
that
endears
me
to
this
style
drank
more
like
a
thin
stout
or
porter
two
styles
i
am
not
much
of
a
fan
of
notes
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
a
doppelbock
as
well
as
a
little
thin
that
said
it
provides
those
nice
dark
sweet
fruity
and
bready
flavors
you
expect
not
a
bad
doppelbock
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
clear
dark
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
a
lot
of
chocolate
in
the
aroma
with
some
dark
breadiness
and
dark
fruit
chocolate
cocoa
powder
and
a
coffeelike
bitterness
with
a
touch
of
raisin
sweetness
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
slightly
harsh
carbonation
while
the
potential
is
there
this
one
misses
the
mark
a
little
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
taste
is
thin
but
there
are
flavors
of
coffee
and
malts
with
a
very
dry
finish
very
easy
to
drink
but
much
too
thin
for
this
style
of
beer
this
is
a
bit
of
a
mess
and
for
me
requires
an
accompaniment
of
a
meaty
stew
rather
than
on
its
own
or
with
cheese
for
me
dopplebocks
are
more
a
treat
and
this
example
while
worth
trying
is
well
outside
the
style
range
overall
impression
very
enjoyable
dopplebock
that
went
nicely
with
a
mediumrare
burger
overall
this
is
my
favorite
thomas
creek
offering
that
ive
had
so
far
a
tasty
robust
beer
that
looks
good
and
goes
well
with
a
bit
of
cold
weather
and
a
hearty
meal
good
showing
tcb
taste
was
slightly
toasted
malts
again
very
mild
gentle
alcohol
twinge
weak
mouthfeel
i
guess
its
kinda
drinkable
just
boring
d
really
easy
drinking
and
great
flavor
good
show
very
nice
to
drink
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
this
brewery
single
from
the
charleston
beer
exchange
i
would
say
this
was
one
of
the
lighter
beers
of
the
style
i
have
had
poured
a
chesnut
brown
color
with
a
thinner
but
pretty
well
sustained
off
white
headvery
light
aromasi
picked
up
some
caramel
and
a
passing
iron
note
flavors
seemed
to
be
a
bit
watered
down
to
melight
caramel
and
dark
fruit
mainly
with
a
little
toasty
maltbut
again
the
flavors
dont
show
through
that
great
due
to
thin
feel
eh
an
average
to
below
average
take
on
the
style
in
my
opinion
12
oz
burgundy
pour
solid
cream
colored
head
that
stuck
around
nicely
roast
malt
and
humid
smelling
mostly
malt
caramel
some
mild
red
fruit
and
raisin
a
definite
creaminess
to
it
didnt
really
get
any
coffee
out
of
this
on
the
light
end
of
medium
body
was
fairly
surprised
by
this
one
drinkable
i
enjoyed
it
i
thought
this
was
slightly
better
than
rated
here
drinkability
not
your
typical
doppelbock
due
to
the
somewhat
bitter
cocoa
sweetness
outstanding
and
easily
drinkable
put
another
one
in
the
win
column
for
thomas
creek
medium
body
feels
a
bit
light
for
a
doppelbock
not
quite
the
meal
in
a
glass
others
are
that
said
the
carbonation
level
is
outstanding
and
leaves
a
soft
plush
texture
maybe
not
your
textbook
doppelbock
but
an
enjoyable
beer
nonetheless
very
difficult
to
compare
to
anything
nice
complex
flavor
like
a
stout
with
a
body
similar
to
a
porter
nicely
drinkable
but
lacking
some
real
character
its
fine
but
wont
be
remembered
in
a
month
drinks
easy
enough
the
dryness
would
probably
make
me
move
on
before
the
abv
would
a
pretty
drinkable
doople
that
has
a
few
stylistic
flaws
that
makesthink
this
could
be
a
porter
wouldve
scored
better
poured
into
a
mug
color
was
deep
brown
looked
somewhat
watery
little
to
no
head
to
speak
of
smell
is
mostly
of
roasted
malts
taste
is
more
like
a
stout
than
a
doppelbock
in
my
humble
opinion
mostly
roasted
malts
some
caramel
sweetness
in
the
background
a
dry
and
slightly
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
watery
drinkability
is
descent
its
nothing
great
there
are
much
better
doppels
out
there
id
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
10oz
serving
on
cask
at
raleigh
times
with
a
special
concoction
of
cocoa
powders
added
to
the
mix
only
the
second
cask
lager
ive
ever
seen
foothills
torch
pilsner
being
the
other
passed
over
for
the
other
two
firkins
offered
that
night
and
the
first
ive
had
the
beer
is
a
nice
murkey
brown
with
a
decent
frothy
khaki
head
that
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
that
leaves
great
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
a
decent
amount
of
brown
malts
and
slight
cocoa
the
taste
is
a
wonderfully
smooth
amount
of
brown
malts
with
cocoa
accentuating
everything
very
nicely
especially
in
the
finish
the
beer
is
quite
light
and
smooth
this
one
certainly
benefits
from
the
cask
offering
very
enjoyable
id
love
to
see
more
doppelbocks
on
cask
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
beer
drinkability
its
not
your
typical
doppelbock
with
its
somewhat
unconventional
use
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
though
im
kind
of
digging
that
i
still
fear
an
onset
of
infection
wouldve
been
the
future
for
this
particular
bottle
and
regrettably
i
see
no
born
on
dating
so
maybe
stick
to
draft
with
this
one
i
could
drink
this
all
night
im
not
sure
what
it
is
but
it
is
delicious
not
a
bad
dopplebock
but
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
a
little
too
sweet
like
that
of
a
poor
brown
ale
drinkability
this
hides
the
6
25
abv
well
i
could
have
several
while
this
is
not
the
best
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
it
is
very
good
i
like
the
sweet
caramel
tones
drinkability
not
all
that
great
the
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
the
acidity
and
the
burnt
roasted
offflavors
that
definitely
do
not
belong
in
a
doppelbock
make
this
beer
almost
difficult
to
drink
m
d
its
got
a
nice
little
sting
of
carbonation
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
towards
finish
quite
tingly
its
a
touch
thin
but
not
a
complete
deal
breaker
i
dont
mind
this
one
and
dont
have
a
problem
with
finishing
the
sixpack
i
dont
know
how
eager
id
be
to
buy
it
in
the
future
though
d
this
is
an
unexceptional
beer
its
not
horrible
its
not
great
either
fairly
drinkable
and
a
good
attempt
at
the
style
but
off
on
a
few
marks
most
notably
the
heavy
presence
of
roasted
and
chocolate
notes
on
the
palate
and
the
toolightforstyle
body
still
not
a
bad
go
from
a
somewhatlocal
brewing
institution
first
whiff
when
i
opened
the
bottle
was
fruity
and
ciderlike
while
the
second
was
smokier
and
maltier
but
still
with
a
strong
hard
cider
overtone
pours
an
opaque
chocolaty
brown
with
a
thick
frothy
not
too
persistent
pale
tan
head
flavor
is
rather
wan
though
more
like
cider
than
beer
just
a
hint
of
malt
and
a
touch
of
hops
and
smoke
and
a
little
watery
texture
is
thin
and
watery
like
flat
cola
i
have
had
better
but
this
is
ok
also
called
the
deep
water
dopplebock
on
my
label
poured
a
deep
brown
until
held
up
to
light
and
the
redness
really
comes
out
after
this
the
experience
is
a
little
bland
the
aroma
is
almost
as
deep
as
the
color
but
the
intrigue
seems
to
end
there
mouthfeel
is
quite
decent
almost
reminiscent
of
a
light
porter
but
the
flavor
is
a
little
bland
and
the
alcohol
definitely
makes
an
appearance
not
bad
but
not
the
best
i
expected
more
from
the
guys
that
make
a
delicious
vanilla
cream
ale
roasted
malts
a
tad
cola
like
in
fizzy
flavors
had
one
on
tap
at
the
thomas
creek
brewery
bash
now
called
deep
water
doppelbock
pours
a
dark
almost
black
brown
with
a
thick
creamy
head
aroma
is
of
dark
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
malts
the
taste
is
what
throws
this
beer
off
way
off
style
more
like
a
cream
stout
that
an
doppelbock
not
a
bad
beer
just
one
i
would
not
seek
out
smells
sweet
with
roasted
malts
taste
like
roasted
malts
too
but
theres
some
sourness
that
really
feels
out
of
place
well
carbonated
but
maybe
only
slightly
too
much
so
tastes
better
as
the
beer
warms
up
or
my
palate
deadens
further
but
still
not
great
d
decent
drinkability
for
a
doppel
especially
with
a
respectable
abv
of
6
25
drinkability
better
as
it
warms
nothing
grand
but
a
tasty
doppelbock
session
beer
i
tend
to
favor
local
beers
whenever
i
get
the
chance
tc
definitely
qualifies
as
a
local
brewery
for
me
of
the
three
i
sampled
amber
doppelbock
and
pilsner
at
dinner
the
doppel
excuse
me
dopplebock
was
my
favorite
it
served
as
a
standalone
dessert
after
a
great
meal
but
would
pair
nicely
with
good
chocolate
and
ice
cream
for
certain
it
would
also
be
a
winner
with
anything
blackened
catfish
even
not
too
sweet
not
too
bitter
a
good
balance
definite
coffee
notes
abound
a
nice
oily
finish
stands
out
in
my
memory
pours
a
rich
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
substantial
brown
head
good
lacing
smell
of
caramelbrown
sugar
with
faint
hops
taste
was
caramelcoffee
mix
with
a
nice
touch
of
sharpness
from
the
hops
what
stays
behind
is
the
prmamry
taste
and
a
slight
touch
of
hops
chewy
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
medium
with
a
very
light
apparent
carbonation
drinkability
not
bad
overall
not
appealing
and
not
very
true
to
style
i
wouldnt
return
to
this
one
this
is
the
best
tc
brew
so
far
that
i
have
tasted
really
not
bad
and
drinkable
for
sure
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
going
on
with
this
one
but
with
a
few
tweaks
it
could
be
something
prett
damn
good
thanks
to
mikesgroove
for
this
one
a
bit
light
for
the
style
chocolate
malt
presents
upfront
and
the
beer
then
thins
out
a
bit
too
much
some
mild
astringency
that
seemed
out
of
place
for
the
style
on
the
positive
side
the
beer
was
very
smooth
and
the
alchohol
not
at
all
prominent
not
on
par
with
the
traditional
german
doppels
and
at
best
an
average
example
of
a
more
restrained
american
take
on
the
style
d
overall
this
was
very
good
and
my
favorite
from
thomas
creek
thus
far
great
consistency
and
highly
recommended
nice
try
from
the
boys
in
greenville
thomas
creek
is
ok
beer
i
dont
know
what
went
wrong
with
this
initially
pretty
strong
with
creamy
coffee
tones
and
enough
carbonation
to
suit
the
style
but
loses
its
way
before
the
finish
and
then
regains
its
footing
somewhat
for
a
mellow
respectable
aftertaste
while
not
containig
the
depth
or
complexity
of
a
classic
doppplebock
this
is
a
pleasant
sipper
that
has
me
giving
props
to
the
boys
in
the
palmetto
state
this
is
an
ok
beer
not
much
hops
to
it
but
nice
and
malty
not
too
sweet
goes
well
with
burgers
and
fries
12
ounce
bottle
tcd08
on
label
always
a
sucker
for
a
dopplebock
even
the
bad
ones
this
beer
falls
somewhere
in
the
average
catagory
more
boldness
and
maltiness
than
usually
found
in
american
renditions
they
really
piled
on
the
chocolate
malts
to
bring
out
a
robust
flavor
along
with
mild
overripened
fruits
after
the
initial
sip
subsides
faint
flavors
of
baking
soda
soapy
and
vegetables
corn
begins
to
come
through
the
beer
falls
apart
a
bit
in
the
finish
giving
off
a
colalike
sweetness
and
flavor
i
still
liked
it
pretty
well
though
good
drinkable
a
little
too
pronounced
on
the
alcohol
thanks
goes
to
ross
from
another
place
for
this
poured
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
nice
sized
tan
head
that
left
some
nice
lacing
aroma
a
ni
ce

with
dark

is
it
choclate

some

alcohol
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
knoxville
brewers
jam
2001
and
really
enjoyed
it
i
havent
had
it
since
then
until
now
and
wow
was
it
better
on
tap
this
pours
well
but
even
the
nose
is
soapy
and
kind
of
foul
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
not
much
on
the
front
end
and
a
bitter
unpleasant
bite
at
the
end
i
will
need
to
test
it
on
tap
again
but
if
this
bottle
is
indicative
of
the
beer
i
must
have
been
drunk
5
years
ago
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
decent
head
and
some
lacing
smells
strong
of
chocolate
and
coffee
not
the
most
pleasent
i
have
encountered
either
the
taste
is
definitely
that
of
a
stout
more
than
anything
else
too
watery
and
sour
though
the
flavor
is
decent
but
not
exceptional
i
would
recommend
trying
it
if
you
are
into
stouts
and
bocks
but
maybe
not
otherwise
this
one
was
undrinkable
as
well
it
had
the
same
awful
characteristics
143

aroma
is

syrupy

behind

the

and
off
tasting
this
beer
pours
a
dark
chocolate
brown
with
an
off
white
head
that
is
delightfully
frothy
the
head
dissipates
to
a
thin
film
that
laces
nicely
down
the
glass
the
beer
smells
mostly
of
semisweet
dark
chocolate
and
is
quite
nice
unfotunately
this
beer
seems
to
fall
apart
at
the
taste
there
is
the
same
underlying
chocolate
taste
but
there
is
a
very
forward
overy
sweet
almost
bad
candy
like
taste
to
the
beer
this
is
very
unenjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
not
to
bad
with
the
thickness
and
carbonation
overall
i
cannot
say
that
i
would
grab
this
one
again
poor
taste
just
leads
to
a
poor
overall
experience
drinking
the
beer
great
drinkability
and
a
great
beer
from
thomas
creek
i
will
definitely
sample
this
one
again
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
do
like
it
id
drink
a
few
in
a
row
if
i
could
ill
beat
the
dead
horse
once
more
this
beer
is
lousy
as
a
doppel
but
tasty
if
you
just
drink
it
as
is
thanks
timtheenchanta
for
supplying
me
some
south
carolina
beers
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
for
the
style
imo
and
the
carbonation
is
just
too
high
making
this
a
one
and
done
for
me
many
other
fine
examples
of
the
style
but
glad
to
get
the
opportunity
to
try
this
offering
from
thomas
creek
not
bad
but
the
roast
is
distracting
for
what
should
be
a
dark
and
yet
smooth
beer
uf
body
is
light
to
medium
with
a
grainy
and
dry
sort
of
texture
you
really
cant
call
this
a
dopplebock
more
of
a
black
lager
or
shwartzbier
drinkability
although
it
is
not
on
point
for
the
style
not
quite
a
porter
not
quite
a
doppelbock
but
somewhat
tasty
the
thin
body
and
the
lack
of
strength
made
this
a
drinkable
beer
judged
on
its
own
merit
it
is
not
half
bad
but
slapping
a
label
proclaiming
the
contents
to
be
a
well
known
style
does
not
make
it
so
and
just
for
that
atrocity
a
few
points
were
shaved
off
the
rating
i
was
worried
that
the
growler
may
go
flat
before
i
drank
it
all
not
to
worry
it
was
gone
before
nite
end
if
youre
looking
for
a
bock
i
say
skip
this
one
if
youre
looking
a
really
good
drinkable
dark
beer
this
is
up
there
ive
yet
to
have
a
thomas
creek
i
dont
like
91602
dopplebock
more
like
just
a
dark
bock
its
a
bit
hoppier
than
i
like
for
a
dopple
as
well
beer
poured
a
pale
brown
and
due
to
festival
tasting
and
2
5oz
shot
glass
servings
i
couldnt
fairly
judge
the
head
the
aroma
was
of
malt
and
hops
the
taste
was
malty
but
fairly
hoppy
which
i
wasnt
expecting
and
didnt
really
enjoy
very
dry
as
well
i
will
have
to
revisit
this
after
ive
tried
other
but
i
wasnt
impressed
a
little
too
thin
and
not
malty
enough
to
qualify
as
a
true
doppelbock
in
my
opinion
although
the
appearance
is
fairly
good
it
looked
a
bit
too
pale
for
doppelbock
status
taste
was
indeed
on
the
malty
side
but
the
hop
bitterness
didnt
seem
to
fit
well
it
was
quite
drinkable
just
not
in
the
way
it
should
be
a
decent
beer
overall
nothing
wrong
with
that
beer
flawless
although
not
spectacular
brown
dark
red
color
pour
off
white
head
rose
and
retreated
to
a
ring
and
left
behind
spotty
lacing
aroma
was
of
molasses
honey
malts
and
roast
taste
was
of
molasses
burnt
sugar
roast
and
a
caramel
sweetness
mild
carbonation
with
a
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
the
dopplebock
style
never
really
works
for
me
overall
weihenstephaner
is
in
my
opinion
the
absolute
best
brewer
on
planet
earth
i
havent
had
a
beer
from
them
that
i
have
disliked
only
liked
some
more
than
others
this
is
right
up
there
as
a
world
class
beer
smiling
from
ear
to
ear
absolutely
love
overall
doppelbock
yes
awesome
to
me
priceless
so
worth
my
money
nice
rich
malty
dopplebock
deep
malty
molasses
nose
rich
deep
sweet
taste
that
stays
with
you
long
after
the
swig
a
superb
beer
to
sip
on
a
cold
winter
or
spring
evening
a
big
girl
and
a
real
treat
lots
of
malt
and
sour
cherry
hints
of
coffee
on
the
nose
not
a
lot
of
body
or
head
but
thats
to
be
expected
pretty
good
overall
but
the
maltiness
limits
me
personally
to
one
bottle
at
a
time
pours
a
dark
brown
root
beer
color
with
a
very
light
brown
head
that
disappears
quickly
very
faint
nose
but
dark
malt
notes
predominate
the
taste
is
amazing
perfectly
malty
with
nutmegy
and
brown
sugar
notes
one
of
the
tastiest
and
most
balanced
hypermalty
beers
ive
had
mouthfeel
is
middle
to
heavy
weight
with
a
slight
amount
of
chew
wonderful
o
what
a
beer
tremendous
flavors
and
mixture
of
all
the
layers
of
complexity
that
is
what
i
personally
love
about
the
style
its
not
necessarily
the
flavors
themselves
but
how
they
blend
the
sweet
to
bold
to
bitter
progression
of
the
drink
is
amazingly
executed
this
one
is
certainly
going
in
my
top
5
beers
ive
tasted
its
a
heavy
drinking
beer
but
damn
if
it
isnt
enjoyable
all
the
way
through
a
deep
dark
opaque
rubymahogany
in
color
with
a
creamcaramel
head
this
beer
is
strong
on
the
coffee
and
cocoa
notes
most
especially
the
former
both
in
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
there
is
a
malty
brownbread
body
to
the
flavor
with
a
dried
fruit
sweetness
behind
it
all
it
has
all
the
richness
that
a
dark
beer
usually
has
but
sits
much
lighter
than
it
looks
like
it
will
the
feel
is
smooth
yet
lightly
effervescent
it
pairs
just
as
well
with
rich
food
as
it
does
with
drinking
by
itself
im
not
usually
a
dark
beer
man
but
this
i
could
drink
pints
of
ive
never
had
a
doppelbock
before
so
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
i
have
to
say
though
it
was
very
good
i
would
have
given
the
smell
higher
rating
but
it
wasnt
very
pronounced
but
did
smell
good
the
taste
is
what
really
matters
it
has
a
perfect
sweetness
to
it
with
pretty
much
no
bitterness
whatsoever
it
looks
like
a
porter
or
stout
in
the
glass
but
definately
does
not
taste
like
one
i
will
be
buying
this
again
much
attention
gets
paid
to
the
hefeweizen
but
dont
look
past
this
doppelbock
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
doppelbock
style
and
this
is
a
good
example
of
one
500ml
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glasspours
dark
reddish
brown
with
2
fingers
of
pale
beige
head
and
lacing
travels
all
to
bottom
of
glass
rich
yeasty
brown
bread
and
malt
smell
and
taste
with
smooth
feel
on
the
mouthnot
too
heavy
but
still
had
to
crank
up
the
ac
to
enjoy
in
west
africa
weihenstephan
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
brewerys
and
personally
i
dont
think
anyone
makes
a
better
wheat
beer
so
i
was
very
much
looking
forward
to
this
one
the
beer
was
a
nice
one
with
plenty
of
malt
sweetness
and
dark
fruits
coming
through
sure
it
didnt
quite
match
the
brewerys
flagship
hefeweizen
but
it
was
still
a
very
nice
doppelbock
with
enough
going
for
it
to
make
things
interesting
a
decent
beer
well
worth
picking
up
but
its
not
one
of
the
brewerys
best
offerings
mainly
because
they
have
already
set
the
bar
so
high
one
of
the
best
ive
had
i
will
have
to
try
this
next
to
salvator
see
which
is
better
an
impressive
specimen
of
maltiness
and
the
toasted
nut
likeness
is
pretty
wild
good
example
of
the
style
a
bit
too
thin
for
me
though
my
favorite
doppelbock
is
sam
adams
double
bock
o
this
is
a
beautiful
doppelbock
example
a
tour
de
malt
with
virtually
zero
hop
flavors
involved
a
little
additional
dark
fruit
complexity
to
the
flavor
profile
and
a
slightly
thicker
mouthfeel
and
this
would
approach
perfect
5
territory
for
me
overall
incredibly
flavordrenched
and
perfect
for
a
chilly
latefall
weekend
from
a
guy
who
doesnt
ordinarily
like
bocks
this
is
a
mindblowing
brew
weihenstephaner
is
magical
allaround
solid
intense
but
very
drinkable
smooth
and
frothy
but
crisp
rich
flavorful
and
satisfying
with
lots
of
delicious
malt
and
dark
fruitiness
the
7
4
abv
is
very
well
hidden
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
from
an
outstanding
brewery
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
i
do
not
think
this
doppelbock
is
as
good
as
ayinger
celebrator
even
though
it
is
rated
higher
but
it
is
an
excellent
beer
nonetheless
condor
recommended
and
approved
cheers
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
an
excellent
dopplebock
and
it
nails
every
category
aroma
appearance
taste
palate
and
the
overall
o
roasty
sweetness
other
reviews
have
compared
the
aftertaste
to
syrupy
malt
followed
crusty
banana
bread
which
is
spot
on
in
my
opinion
wonderful
i
havent
had
a
doppelbock
in
some
time
but
this
beer
is
so
wonderful
one
should
never
doubt
a
weihenstephaner
product
and
this
is
no
exception
o
the
roasty
malt
comes
in
sweet
then
a
slight
crusty
banana
bread
takes
over
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
this
and
salvator
are
my
favorite
doppelbocks
overall
the
perfect
breather
for
a
palate
thats
hopobsessed
very
filling
too
one
of
these
and
im
done
for

and
one
that
i
am
glad
i
finally
had
the
opportunity
to
try
i
seemed
to
miss
picking
it
up
year
in
year
out
wonderful
flavors
and
a
really
great
beer
from
an
excellent
brewery
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
with
well
hidden
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
medium
bodied
overall
not
my
favorite
style
but
among
my
favorites
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
very
flavorful
doppelbock
with
a
very
easy
drinking
and
crisp
feel
in
light
of
its
abv
of
7
4
this
is
one
nice
drinker
and
one
i
will
certainly
come
back
to
again
pours
a
nice
deep
dark
brown
pinkish
purplish
color
with
a
great
foamy
head
smells
so
malty
and
sweet
does
not
taste
sweet
however
very
crips
and
refreshing
with
great
body
not
much
bitterness
at
all
and
very
clean
i
did
not
detect
much
fruitiness
as
others
have
noted
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
and
a
great
one
at
that
overall
a
great
beer
with
near
ideal
doppelbock
qualities
not
too
sweet
clean
flavors
that
are
enticing
and
clean
mouthfeel
the
bottle
is
so
us
usual
and
beautiful
i
had
to
try
it
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pilsner
at
a
temperature
between
the
fridge
and
room
temp
color
is
a
crystal
clear
strawberry
red
with
the
slightest
brown
tinge
when
held
up
to
intense
light
thin
tan
head
nice
lacing
aroma
is
yeasty
with
roasted
malt
and
caramel

with
mild

is
again
yeasty
roasted
malt
toffee
sweetness
with
a
slightly
piney
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
thin
and
a
bit
foamy
this
is
a
style
that
i
do
not
understand
doppelbock
so
i
am
rating
it
just
as
an
enjoyable
brew
and
experience
on
that
basis
i
will
say
it
is
a
very
good
to
outstanding
lager
well
worth
sampling
and
this
one
has
a
bear
not
a
goat
on
the
label
overall
an
absolutely
delicious
beer
that
i
would
love
to
drink
again
due
to
being
dark
and
on
the
heavyside
i
would
see
this
a
more
of
a
winter
beer
than
a
warm
weather
beer
almost
a
desert
quality
i
will
be
purchasing
this
beer
again
for
sure
a
great
value
for
the
money
i
believe
i
spent
less
than
4
for
the
bottle
glass
imperial
pint
notes
a
great
quality
beer
but
very
particular
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
103013
from
bottle
almost
need
a
spoon
with
this
malt
up
the
nose
and
caramel
on
the
tongue
with
a
middling
body
a
lingering
bittersweetness
that
tells
of
a
well
thought
out
concoction
the
7
4
abv
will
force
me
to
keep
this
new
friend
in
perspective
like
perspective
is
what
im
here
for
a
new
favorite
overall
while
ive
not
had
many
doppelbocks
i
am
certain
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
out
there
get
it
and
enjoy
this
is
an
excellent
starkbier
which
apparently
translates
in
the
import
state
sc
as
a
malt
liquor
the
palate
appearance
and
flavor
are
both
very
good
leaving
only
the
weak
nose
as
a
detriment
i
may
be
forced
to
buy
a
case
to
verify
the
weak
nose
o
i
want
to
rate
it
higher
because
of
the
brewery
and
maybe
its
exceptional
for
the
style
but
its
my
first
doppelbock
so
ill
have
to
come
back
to
it
someday
taste
is
certainly
bold
even
sweet
up
front
with
an
underbelly
of
fruit
below
the
thick
and
chewy
maltiness
of
the
toasty
grains
and
although
this
is
probably
a
premier
doppelbock
in
itself
i
wasnt
very
impressed
here
id
say
stick
to
weihenstephaners
hefeweizens
as
they
are
likely
the
best
youll
ever
taste
overall
good
but
not
great
i
prefer
their
other
brews
over
this
and
that
i
think
is
a
good
thing
because
their
other
brews
are
much
easier
to
get
this
is
2nd
to
only
celebrator
for
dopplebocks
for
me
just
great
stuff
this
is
a
very
nice
malt
forward
example
of
a
doppelbock
i
still
prefer
the
lighter
doppelbock
style
of
paulaners
salvator
but
this
is
obviously
a
great
brew
a
little
like
a
good
stout
in
a
lighter
weight
form
definitely
toasted
dark
and
raisiny
pours
dark
ruby
red
toward
brown
tan
head
some
peppery

good
dark
fruit
profile
sticky
sweet
licorice
notes
hints
of
spice
yeast
and
grape
undertones
hint
of
sweet
cherry
cinnamon
notes
overall
really
smooth
and
complex
overall
simply
a
delightful
beer
and
certainly
a
classic
of
the
style
ive
enjoyed
it
a
few
times
but
finally
got
around
to
reviewing
it
a
finerdrinking
malt
bomb
you
are
very
unlikely
to
find
i
think
i
prefer
celebrator
just
slightly
but
this
is
still
delicious
overall
incredible
doppelbock
might
be
the
best
ive
had
overall
weihenstephaner
can
do
no
wrong
this
beer
is
a
continuation
of
their
world
class

brown

excellent
clarity

a
faint
trace
of
off

in

the
body

dark
malt
forward
the
finish
is
more
malt
and
is
fairly
smooth
o
exceptional
doppelbock
better
than
i
remember
but
i
knew
it
was
upper
echelon
all
along

a
silken
and
ample
malt
with
a
perfect
compliment
of
dark
fruits
and
light
chocolate

and
a
sweet

overall
a
bit
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
a
flavorful
interpretation
of

a
very
deep

with
about
1
finger
of

that
dissipates
fairly
fast
just

good
just
like
the
smell
goes
down
very
easy
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
i
like
doublebocks
and
this
one
is
no
exception
and
didnt
disappoint
at
all
o
great
dopple
and
a
must
try
they
taste
is
subtle
and
is
best
server
at
just
below
room
temp
or
it
loses
the
best
parts
of
tastes
not
fridge
beer
for
me
but
really
close
o
good
beer
as
weihenstephaner
seems
to
always
make
o
quite
the
tasty
doppelbock
although
not
good
enough
to
make
this
a
frequent
indulgence
for
me
especially
at
the
price
500ml
weizen
glass
o
awesome
dopplebock
this
is
one
of
my
gotos
for
a
kick
ass
german
beer
o
very
similar
to
ayingers
celebrator
with
higher
carbonation
and
mocha
taste
on
back
end
exceptional
overall
this
is
a
doppelbock
i
can
get
behind
i
havent
been
the
greatest
fan
of
the
style
nor
have
become
one
since
this
beer
but
this
is
one
that
really
showcases
the
great
carameltoffee
malt
notes
without
being
super
boozy
alcohol
warms
but
does
not
overpower
a
solid
doppelbock
and
one
i
would
gladly
enjoy
again
overall
amazing
beer
i
truly
feel
this
beer
deserves
the
ratings
it
has
i
dont
often
say
that
delicious
dark
full
in
flavor
and
body
would
definitely
buy
again
maybe
its
just
the
doppelbock
kick
im
on
but
this
is
a
top
tier
beer
that
has
earned
its
reputation
if
i
were
to
nitpick
id
like
a
little
heavier
body
and
more
pronounced
flavors
but
anyone
who
enjoys
bocks
will
find
very
little
to
complain
about
here
i
was
in
freising
this
spring
and
kept
seeing
the
signs
for
the
home
of
korbinian
weihenstephaner
dominates
this
munich
suburb
near
the
airport
i
like
malty
bavarian
biers
and
truly
enjoyed
this
selection
it
is
smooth
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
great
choice
for
after
dinner
a
delicious
beer
that
i
will
enjoy
again
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
and
they
got
it
right
overall
i
expected
better
from
this
brewery
but
i
am
now
remembering
why
i
havent
had
this
beer
in
years
i
will
give
it
another
try
and
rating
in
the
future
i
will
be
sure
to
try
it
on
draft
and
on
bottle
from
another
supplier
o
ive
tasted
this
a
couple
of
times
a
year
for
a
while
now
and
it
always
blows
me
away
just
such
a
well
made
beer
absolutely
delicious
drink
i
usually
consume
it
quite
cold
as
i
find
it
can
get
cloying
at
higher
serving
temps
a
winner
of
a
beer
prost
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
doppelbock
all
around
excellent
malt
flavors
with
just
the
right
edge
of
booziness
balance
complexity
and
sensory
appeal
in
every
aspect
this
truly
exemplifies
the
art
of
brewing
in
that
being
a
big
rich
powerful
beer
it
also
remains
easy
drinking
o
7
4
alcohol
never
tasted
it
until
of
course
i
finished
a
masterpiece
i
will
buy
more
probably
much
better
fresh
back
in
the
home
country
where
the
hops
being
more
assertive
but
still
it
stands
at
the
top
of
the
dopplebock
hill
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
german
style
doppelbock
overall
a
fantastic
brew
wish
i
could
get
this
in
12
packs
here
in
the
states
would
have
again
worth
trying
if
you
have
access
to
it
overall
a
big
bold
german
doppelbock
similar
in
flavor
to
ayinger
celebrator
only
sweeter
o
maybe
it
is
best
to
drink
it
with
some
cake
or
something
similar
personallyi
dont
feel
it
tastybut
good
beer
for
the
style
prost
the
mouthfeel
on
this
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
o
very
pleasant
beer
i
detected
more
of
the
alcohol
after
the
beer
warms
up
but
it
has
enough
sweet
notes
and
dried
fruits
to
help
to
cover
it
pretty
good
4
3
while
the
sweetness
might
turn
some
off
its
definitely
one
of
the
sweetest
doppelbocks
i
have
ever
had
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
full
of
character
worth
consideration
a
rich
golden
brown
with
a
two
inch
head
thick
looking
strong
bread
sour
dough
aroma
the
hops
comes
through
more
than
expected
but
still
nice
the
taste
is
completely
different
than
the
smell
full
malt
flavor
sweet
plums
medium
to
heavy
body
leaves
a
slight
stickiness
on
the
lips
overall
best
doppelbock
ive
had
to
date
makes
me
want
to
try
more
o
wow
this
one
is
really
full
of
flavor
nice
complexity
a
little
on
the
sweeter
side
a
great
beer
for
the
fallwinter
seasons
it
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
smelled
of
heavy
malts
and
coffee
the
first
taste
was
heavy
on
the
burnt
malts
and
chocolate
and
definitely
stood
apart
from
the
doppelbocks
i
was
familiar
the
slightly
sweet
malts
and
coffee
flavors
come
through
on
this
nicely
balanced
beer
the
korbinian
was
deep
and
rich
with
a
thick
mouthfeel
that
stuck
with
the
heavy
bready
brew
this
is
not
a
beer
you
drink
quickly
but
rather
one
you
sit
back
and
allow
to
consume
you
the
korbinian
was
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
i
have
ever
had
o
just
solid
leaves
a
nice
beer
mustache
as
an
added
bonus
after
a
big
sip
too
o
a
wonderful
doppelbock
tasty
and
easy
drinking
very
complex
beer
with
lots
of
character
more
dark
fruit
than
expected
great
melanoidin
presence
the
justatouch
of
bitterness
accompanies
the
creamy
goodness
of
the
beer
with
the
initial
taste
as
stated
the
last
touch
is
bready
and
has
minimal
aftertaste
not
overly
sweet
nor
dry
overall
a
really
great
authentic
doppelbock
great
toasty
malt
taste
with
a
good
presence
of
dark
fruit
o
this
is
a
malt
and
chocolate
bomb
and
im
loving
every
sip
of
it
its
rich
creamy
and
smooth
such
an
easy
drinker
with
flavors
that
work
great
together
this
doppelbock
definitely
worth
you
checking
out
pours
very
dark
brown
very
dark
with
a
small
island
of
white
foam
brown
sugar
malty
nose
taste
is
a
rich
malty
blend
slick
light
sugar
very
minor
carbonation
makes
it
smooth
milk
chocolate
layers
underneath
smooth
and
tasty
overall
just
a
fantastic
doppelbock
a
complex
beer
and
easily
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
overall
very
impressive
doppelbock
from
weihenstephaner
and
id
expect
no
less
definitely
worth
giving
a
try
overall
a
good
beer
ill
have
to
try
to
pick
this
up
again
overall
solid
beer
if
you
like
doppelbocks
i
assume
you
would
be
all
over
it
the
only
doppelbock
that
has
amazed
is
ayinger
its
worth
a
try
simply
for
the
fact
that
its
one
of
oldest
and
most
consistent
breweries
in
the
world
overall
a
blast
of
fruitcake
and
plumbs
figs
raisens
a
very
nice
beer
overall
a
superb
doppelbock
its
better
not
to
serve
this
beer
too
cold
in
order
to
appreciate
its
finer
subtleties
as
it
warms
up
a
pilsner
glass
is
a
good
choice
for
the
beer
food
match
mainly
a
dessert
beer
but
not
too
sweet
that
it
wouldnt
pair
with
a
main
course
either
perhaps
game
meats
like
venison
or
even
kangaroo
also
could
work
with
chargrilled
zucchini
mushrooms
and
eggplant
for
my
vegan
brethren
overallmy
first
doppelbock
and
it
certainly
wont
be
my
last
this
beer
sets
the
bar
really
high
i
will
definitely
come
back
to
it
in
the
colder
months
amazingly
good
doppelbock
expect
nothing
less
from
this
star
german
brewery
overall
a
fantastic
beer
very
great
doppelbock
american
brewers
need
to
take
note
of
this
beer
highly
recommended
o
very
good
representation
of
the
style
nice
beer
another
really
nice
beer
from
this
brewery
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
here
i
think
the
profile
would
make
this
a
great
beer
for
around
christmas
time
as
it
reminds
me
of
the
types
of
cookies
usually
enjoyed
that
time
of
year
i
could
easily
drink
more
of
this
o
its
oktober
in
july
for
me
and
im
loving
it
probably
my
fav
of
the
style
so
far
tried
side
by
side
with
celebrator
and
much
prefer
weihenstephaner
this
is
a
topnotch
doppelbock
among
the
best
ive
had
clean
sweet
rich
and
flavorful
with
excellent
displays
of
dark
fruit
tough
to
beat
o
like
a
little
brother
to
the
ayinger
celebrator
if
fasting
german
monks
had
a
choice
for
which
to
sustain
themselves
on
the
choice
would
be
rather
clear
the
korbinian
would
be
lunch
and
the
celebrator
would
be
dinner

this
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
on
top
the
retention
is
pretty
good
and
there
is
a
scattered
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
and
there
is
a
grassy
spice
note
also
the
taste
has
some
molasses
some
bread
subtle
carmel
and
dark
malts
and
just
a
tinge
of
spice
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
almost
creamy
overall
its
a
great
beer
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
ive
had
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
i
would
say
that
this
episode
was
really
fucking
stupid
like
really
stupid
just
awful
and
tasha
was
a
bitch
at
the
end
im
glad
i
never
saw
this
before
the
dopplebock
however
was
quite
good
as
i
would
expect
from
weihenstephaner
the
price
on
these
things
continues
to
amaze
me
so
this
beer
will
continue
to
be
in
my
rotation
o
did
this
sidebyside
with
celebrator
and
actually
liked
this
one
a
tad
bit
better
cant
go
wrong
with
either
though
korbinian
is
certainly
an
interestingly
complex
brew
with
aroma
and
flavor
profiles
that
are
both
all
over
the
place
and
perfectly
content
all
at
once
doppelbocks
arent
my
forte
and
i
certainly
havent
had
enough
to
speak
eloquently
on
them
but
korbinian
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
and
certainly
a
good
lesson
in
the
style
still
worth
a
shot
whether
you
are
in
tune
with
doppelbocks
or
not
at
the
price
you
cant
really
lose
the
beer
was
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
minisnifter
glass
producing
a
color
that
was
a
brownish
tinted
black
color
the
aroma
was
malty
with
some
grapey
wine
characteristics
about
the
aroma
my
initial
impression
of
the
taste
was
that
it
was
too
mild
it
was
malty
but
too
mild
the
carbonation
was
modest
enough
to
allow
that
taste
to
linger
but
there
was
little
to
linger
the
sides
of
the
tongue
are
made
away
of
a
slight
tart
hop
taste
but
it
is
well
masked
the
texture
of
a
doppelbock
is
pretty
spot
on
but
the
flavor
is
lacking
while
this
may
be
more
true
to
the
original
version
of
the
style
it
does
not
stack
up
well
against
the
modern
version
god
what
else
is
there
to
say
about
weihenstephan
everything
they
churn
out
is
world
class
and
this
one
stands
tall
against
its
often
cited
hefeweizen
its
an
opposite
drinking
experience
in
many
ways
in
flavor
not
quality
but
it
stands
as
juicy
thickened
and
filled
with
all
kinds
of
flavors
that
work
so
well
together
in
the
bottle
its
a
little
bit
more
bitter
and
medicinal
but
on
tap
its
a
bouquet
of
the
best
aromas
the
doppelbock
style
has
to
offer
ill
be
tasting
this
one
for
days
o
a
wondeful
doppelbock
one
of
my
new
favorites
could
be
a
top
5
beer
for
me
all
the
aromas
and
tastes
of
a
quality
doppelbock
but
not
overly
sweet
didnt
get
the
bloated
feeling
nor
the
sticky
mouth
like
i
do
from
some
bocks
highly
recommend
this
brew
o
a
very
nice
doppelbock
lots
of
subtle
flavors
combine
to
create
a
great
beer
easy
to
drink
yet
complex
i
dont
think
i
like
doppelbocks
so
theres
that
i
should
stop
buying
them
ill
give
this
a
4
because
i
understand
its
pretty
good
despite
my
not
favoring
the
style
im
a
modern
rational
guy
and
can
admit
such
things
this
was
real
sweet
too
sweet
for
me
if
a
woman
tasted
like
this
itd
be
okay
to
me
but
not
a
beer
its
like
when
you
make
tea
but
put
too
much
sugar
in
and
youre
already
in
the
car
so
you
just
drink
it
but
youre
like
tomorrow
remember
to
put
less
sugar
in
had
this
out
of
a
pint
glass
after
a
stone
espresso
imperial
stout
thats
a
beer
for
me
this
tastes
like
something
young
people
would
like
i
may
be
getting
old
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
beer
but
it
is
not
one
i
will
buy
again
there
are
just
some
weird
smells
and
flavors
here
from
whatever
yeast
strain
they
have
used
not
nearly
as
good
an
example
of
the
style
as
can
be
found
out
there
complex
flavors
that
let
the
fruity
esters
sing
while
the
malts
are
bold
but
in
a
delicate
way
alcohol
is
undetectable
and
this
drinks
smooth
perfect
for
an
april
evening
o
a
notch
below
celebrator
ill
agree
but
still
many
footholds
above
the
bocks
ive
had
from
the
states
a
great
offering
overall
a
really
great
example
of
the
style
i
prefer
celebrator
as
it
is
less
sweet
but
it
certainly
doesnt
deviate
from
the
style
othis
is
a
good
nearly
great
beer
the
flavors
are
sweet
and
intense
but
not
cloying
or
gummy
the
feel
is
particularly
wellsuited
to
this
brew
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
example
of
the
style
and
perfect
for
a
chilly
fall
or
winter
evening
even
though
i
am
writing
on
april
1
complex
and
chockfull
of
character
korbinian
is
wellbehaved
for
the
7
4abv
an
excellent
german
brew
its
brown
with
nice
cherry
tones
and
loosely
packed
large
bubbles
that
are
light
tan
and
quick
dissipating
leaving
a
lightly
etched
surface
banana
vanilla
toast
caramel
touch
of
cola
and
gobs
of
nougat
taste
is
plenty
of
malt
a
touch
of
salinity
some
sweet
malts
and
bready
dough
seriously
this
is
a
like
a
sweet
dough
pretzel
really
dig
the
flavor
so
unique
and
works
really
well
medium
on
full
bodied
with
moderate
carb
and
a
slightly
wet
finish
this
is
really
well
done
d
a
wellmade
very
drinkable
doppelbock
from
a
great
german
brewery
they
could
even
make
this
thing
a
little
bigger
in
my
op
still
tasty
and
worth
grabbing
if
you
can
oreally
enjoyed
this
beer
great
flavor
and
feel
enjoyable
for
sipping
on
a
cold
day
grabbed
this
from
my
local
whole
foods
normally
i
reach
for
the
german
wheat
beers
but
with
it
being
march
and
the
bock
season
i
said
why
not
i
was
glad
too
originally
cracked
this
open
to
offset
the
firey
taste
in
my
mouth
from
what
i
was
cooking
was
taken
aback
as
this
wasnt
what
i
thought
itd
be
it
was
an
excellent
semi
milky
sort
of
sweet
brown
sugary
brew
brown
in
color
as
most
bocks
are
there
was
a
hint
of
malt
in
it
not
the
coffee
chocolate
malt
but
more
of
a
toffee
carmely
flavor
so
smooth
i
didnt
dare
mix
it
with
the
rest
of
my
spicy
thai
food
dinner
best
doppelbock
ive
ever
had
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
into
a
tulippint
glass
coded
bottled
date
of
0442
this
pours
a
dark
brown
on
the
edges
and
black
in
the
middle
color
with
a
large
foamy
tan
head
the
smells
are
of
dark
malts
caramel
toffee
brown
sugar
the
feel
is
medium
nice
carbonination
the
taste
is
pretty
good
plenty
of
malts
brown
sugar
toffee
and
caramel
soft
caramel
and
raisin
notes
up
front
not
overly
sweet
kept
in
check
by
the
hoppy
herbal
bite
masked
somewhat
by
the
carbonation
lively
mouth
with
carbonation
yet
silky
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
as
it
rolls
around
slight
nutty
finish
this
is
a
real
nice
drinking
beer
it
doesnt
have
the
huge
flavors
of
some
american
craft
counterparts
but
the
complexity
is
layered
and
subtle
it
drinks
real
easy
the
beer
is
chestnut
brown
with
a
thin
khaki
hued
collar
the
aroma
brings
malt
yeast
light
spice
brown
bread
rich
and
smooth
with
a
mild
sweetness
hints
of
plums
and
raisins
a
beautiful
beer
like
every
other
weihenstephaner
brew
i
have
tried
korbinian
delivers
the
goods
a
great
example
of
the
style
a
pleasure
to
sip
and
savor
ill
definitely
be
having
this
one
again
o
this
is
a
top
notch
dopplebock
no
question
about
it
glad
to
recommend
this
beer
o
i
love
this
brewery
this
is
a
huge
explosion
of
malty
goodness
that
leaves
your
palate
wanting
more
i
would
love
to
have
this
in
a
six
pack
a
beer
i
will
surely
revisit
overall
just
has
that
export
feel
about
it
maybe
im
getting
too
used
to
fresh
american
craft
brews
this
is
not
bad
at
all
though
and
the
7
4
abv
is
hidden
well
drinkweihenstephaner
makes
a
good
beer
here
flavorful
balanced
and
tasty
has
a
bit
of
a
quad
like
flavor
with
the
raisins
and
fruits
good
value
beer
at
3
o
not
as
good
as
ayinger
imo
but
definitely
a
well
balance
and
easy
drinking
beer
id
gladly
drink
this
again
i
expected
this
to
be
good
and
it
really
is
maybe
not
quite
as
complex
as
some
of
the
great
dopplebocks
but
very
flavorful
and
extremely
drinkable
i
would
buy
this
again
and
suggest
it
to
anyone
that
likes
stronger
german
beers
500ml
bottle
a
deep
amberbrown
with
a
couple
fingers
of
rich
light
mocha
head
foamy
retention
with
loads
of
spotty
lace
smells
sticky
and
burnt
with
fresh
floral
notes
and
earthy
citrus
flavors
that
emerge
as
this
is
agitated
the
nose
has
a
nice
robustness
to
it
the
taste
is
sticky
sweet
initially
with
notes
of
cocoa
caramel
dark
roast
and
nuttiness
citric
hops
really
gives
this
a
green
tightness
that
then
begins
to
take
over
the
profile
and
leaves
this
dry
and
bitter
on
the
finish
but
the
sweetness
does
pick
up
again
as
this
warms
the
feel
is
medium
to
fuller
with
a
firm
sharpness
up
front
and
then
more
of
a
smooth
texture
the
rest
of
the
way
tiny
bit
of
warmth
but
this
drinks
nicley
for
7
this
was
a
really
nice
doppelbock
with
the
type
of
rich
flavors
and
smooth
feel
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
probably
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
it
is
very
sweet
and
in
my
opinion
is
a
good
after
dinner
beer
the
abv
can
certainly
pack
a
punch
and
a
22
oz
bottle
can
leave
you
with
a
nice
buzz
this
is
another
great
beer
by
wehenstephaner
i
love
their
history
and
consistency
in
making
really
good
beer
dark
brown
to
amber
in
color
but
clear
tall
sudsy
tan
head
recedes
to
splotchy
areas
lacing
smells
are
yeasty
light
citrus
and
a
sort
of
sourdough
aroma
taste
is
lightly
sweet
with
no
bitterness
at
all
a
very
subtle
spice
in
the
back
and
a
light
clove
presence
a
very
small
hint
of
sweet
chocolate
towards
the
end
has
sweetness
to
it
but
is
also
pretty
dry
at
same
time
smooth
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
very
good
and
ill
look
forward
to
having
again
o
korbinian
is
a
roasty
doppelbock
that
develops
more
chocolaty
dry
cocoa
notes
as
the
brew
progresses
for
a
bit
of
a
twist
on
the
style
its
not
quite
as
clean
as
some
other
german
versions
but
this
doppel
is
a
great
brew
for
any
maltlover
overall
a
really
great
beer
weihenstephan
hits
another
home
run
o
overall
a
fantastic
dopplebock
from
a
classic
brewery
rich
and
sweet
but
balanced
well
for
smooth
and
easy
drinking
for
the
style
overall
its
a
good
beer
to
have
with
sweet
desserts
or
to
sip
at
night
and
enjoy
it
all
by
itself
a
very
interesting
and
complex
taste
plus
great
texture
make
for
a
wonderful
experience
another
high
quality
product
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
p
s
i
wish
4
25
was
an
option
for
overall
just
saying
o
grew
on
me
as
i
reached
the
middle
of
my
glass
as
is
often
the
case
the
aroma
and
finish
will
keep
this
one
in
the
back
of
my
mind
for
a
revisiting
o
a
great
beer
extraordinary
taste
and
mouthfeel
glad
i
found
this
at
my
local
liquor
store
an
awesome
beer
probably
the
prototype
for
a
great
doppelbock
i
would
recommend
this
as
anyones
first
beer
into
the
style
was
really
into
this
beer
i
picked
it
up
half
by
accident
but
i
would
seek
it
out
again
tasty
and
smooth
o
my
impression
of
this
beer
other
than
oh
hell
yes
was
that
if
you
tried
to
convert
a
stoutdrinker
to
a
dopplebock
enthusiast
this
would
be
the
first
step
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
the
better
qualities
of
heavy
stouts
while
holding
true
to
the
essential
bock
flavors
a
fantastic
brew
all
around
this
beer
is
a
wonderful
doppelbock
and
i
highly
recommend
it
taste
is
super
malty
giant
with
a
very
syrupy
almost
molasses
body
and
huge
amounts
of
figs
plums
sugar
and
rye
bread
in
the
finish
incredibly
delicious
almost
meal
like
english
style
beers
stand
no
chance
an
insanely
tasty
beer
super
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
creamy
beyond
belief
such
a
great
example
of
this
style
and
so
affordable
as
well
o
this
is
a
great
beer
most
doppelbocks
seem
to
be
so
sweet
that
it
lowers
their
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
though
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
overall
the
best
ive
had
of
the
style
loved
it
and
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
during
the
colder
months
overall
a
very
good
doppelbock
with
no
hint
of
booziness
like
you
get
from
some
other
doppelbocks
this
is
an
incredibly
flavorful
and
complex
doppelbock
definitely
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
a
long
time
this
was
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
it
took
me
a
little
to
get
into
this
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
but
one
a
night
is
enough
for
me
very
nice
beer
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
by
the
foams
retention
as
i
wasnt
expecting
to
go
down
that
fast
but
everything
else
is
making
up
for
it
excellent
brew
style
wise
4
5
personal
4
stark
eh
i
hope
that
this
has
something
to
do
with
the
stark
fist
of
removal
as
i
have
been
very
pink
as
of
late
with
oktober
being
breast
awareness
month
cancer
and
i
need
more
slack
no
slack
with
respect
to
my
pour
which
resulted
in
twoplus
fingers
of
thick
dense
deeptan
head
with
excellent
retention
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
with
ruby
highlights
and
nequality
clarity
nose
was
redolent
with
malt
and
i
was
afraid
that
it
might
be
too
sweet
for
my
liking
mouthfeel
was
thick
chewy
and
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
had
led
me
to
expect
the
taste
was
cocoa
and
dried
dark
fruits
this
was
a
very
smoothdrinking
beer
and
i
had
swilled
nearly
a
quarter
of
it
before
i
came
to
my
senses
finish
was
semisweet
again
nowhere
near
as
sweet
as
the
nose
led
me
to
believe
this
was
as
the
dme
boys
would
call
it
a
sneaky
beer
proceed
with
caution
excited
to
find
this
after
reading
comparisons
to
celebrator
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
minimal
light
browntan
head
some
lacing
as
i
worked
my
way
through
nose
was
sweet
with
caramel
and
a
little
roasted
malt
very
enticing
taste
followed
up
with
more
sweetness
dark
fruit
a
sweet
bread
taste
and
definitely
some
type
of
chocolate
the
chocolate
was
a
little
muted
and
tasted
like
really
good
and
mellow
cocoa
full
bodied
with
good
carbonation
very
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
and
absolutely
lived
up
to
the
hype
already
looking
forward
to
a
doppelbock
taste
test
with
a
few
other
favorites
o
hands
down
the
best
doppelbock
i
have
ever
had
primarily
due
to
the
fact
that
it
isnt
syrupy
or
too
heavy
as
many
i
have
tried
seem
to
be
will
be
grabbing
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
the
style
side
note
possibly
due
to
the
light
body
i
enjoyed
this
beer
when
it
was
colder
than
the
normal
suggested
temperature
more
like
the
temp
you
would
want
a
dark
lager
yeah
i
know
not
very
beer
geek
of
me
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
a
good
mix
of
flavors
but
they
are
a
little
light
very
smooth
and
drinkable
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
ive
had
korbinian
stays
true
to
style
without
beating
you
over
the
head
with
it
which
i
very
much
appreciate
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
lending
a
light
velvety
texture
to
the
brew
ive
never
been
much
of
a
fan
of
dopplebocks
but
this
is
one
of
the
finer
ones
ive
come
across
and
certainly
something
i
could
see
myself
going
back
to
if
the
mood
strikes
me
just
another
testament
to
the
excellence
the
weihenstephaner
folk
put
forth
as
a
matter
of
practice
a
well
done
well
balanced
brew
nice
and
very
modest
an
outstanding
doppelbock
one
of
the
best
in
its
class
pours
a
nice
frothy
amber
brown
color
with
some
off
white
patchy
lacing
it
smells
wood
aged
but
i
dont
think
it
is
lots
of
oaky
tones
amongst
the
sweet
german
malts
and
biting
alcohol
a
nice
caramel
and
musky
flavor
is
memorable
in
this
beer
but
it
also
has
traces
of
smoke
and
peat
a
really
complex
and
warming
brew
its
got
a
great
feel
as
well
velvet
smooth
big
body
and
subtle
but
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
perfect
fall
season
beer
brilliant
with
grilled
food
cigars
and
college
football
id
recommend
this
baby
to
anyone
who
likes
big
malty
gernam
beers
this
one
is
impressive
this
is
a
great
beer
overall
great
flavor
generous
abv
great
looking
no
reason
to
not
try
it
at
least
once
shocked
it
actually
took
me
this
long
to
finally
try
it
o
this
is
a
style
ive
not
had
in
awhile
but
the
ones
i
have
had
were
quality
beers
this
offering
from
bayerische
staatsbrauerei
weihenstephan
is
certainly
among
them
this
is
my
first
time
having
this
dont
know
what
has
kept
me
but
it
will
certainly
not
be
the
last
o
this
beer
is
true
to
the
brewery
first
class
the
only
other
beer
in
the
style
in
contention
is
ayingers
celebrator
although
it
may
be
in
second
place
pretty
light
mouthfeel
and
the
7
4
abv
is
well
hidden
great
value
overall
this
beer
is
just
effortlessly
good
one
of
the
better
dopplebock
that
i
have
drank
in
a
long
time
the
consistancy
from
this
brewery
is
really
great
every
beer
that
i
have
tried
from
this
brewery
is
awesome
the
price
point
is
always
a
fantastic
value

if

away
caramel
pervades
on
the
nose
as
well
as
the
palate
a
touch
of
prune
or
something
also
makes
an
appearance
the
hops
dont
really
do
much
but
the
carbonation
does
a
little
something
to
balance
it
out
moutfeel
is
a
little
chewy
not
something
i
particularly
liked
in
this
case
though
not
bad
all
in
all
id
say
its
another
good
showing
for
this
brewery
and
for
the
doppelbock
style
although
i
think
a
few
others
have
this
beat
i
apologize
for
a
nofrills
review
but
sometimes
a
nofrills
beer
is
exactly
what
hits

a
really
nice
dopplebock
not
complex
really
but
well
put
together
and
pleasant
the
whole
way
great
drinkability
o
my
overall
impression
of
this
beer
is
very
positive
my
favorite
doppelbock
o
amazingly
drinkable
super
smooth
and
well
balanced
flavors
are
rich
and
creamy
surprisingly
complex
but
its
really
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
that
excel
here
excellent
brew
a
pleasure
to
drink
amazing
example
of
the
style
overall
once
again
not
disappointed
weihenstephaner
has
by
far
the
best
doppelbock
i
have
had
i
dont
want
to
hype
this
up
but
sure
satisfying
beer
it
is
a
little
bland
on
the
smell
but
most
doppelbocks
are
to
begin
with
salud
o
good
flavors
and
aroma
on
this
beer
very
smooth
you
can
just
taste
the
quality
in
the
beer
no
off
flavors
o
great
dopplebock
very
clean
easy
to
drink
smooth
yet
with
complex
flavors
very
enjoyable
o
epic
a
true
paragon
of
the
style
as
good
as
celebrator
low
b
weeeell
shit
this
is
fucking
delicious
remember
the
weihenstephaner
hefeweizen
this
it
its
big
brother
with
a
nasty
aggressive
streak
masterfully
hidden
beneath
good
table
manners
but
unmistakably
not
going
to
take
any
of
your
shit
its
creamy
and
rich
with
a
hint
of
the
floral
taste
you
get
in
that
innocent
little
hefeweizen
and
malty
as
milkballs
milkballs
conjure
the
wrong
taste
let
me
correct
that
its
like
youre
a
fucking
sea
urchin
huddled
at
the
bottom
of
the
deep
dark
scary
ocean
and
eating
the
sweetest
heartiest
dirt
your
little
sea
urchin
self
has
ever
had
the
pleasure
to
slurp
you
cant
see
its
fucking
dark
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
and
besides
that
do
sea
urchins
even
have
eyes
all
you
can
do
is
eat
and
wiggle
your
spines
a
bit
and
guess
what
this
is
still
the
best
dirt
youve
ever
tasted
overall
very
tasty
an
exemplar
of
the
style
though
it
lacks
some
sweetness
and
intensity
compared
to
a
few
other
examples
of
the
style
the
flavor
brings
to
mind
a
traditional
single
bock
more
than
a
doppelbock
especially
compared
to
something
like
eku
28
for
example
overall
this
is
awesome
a
pleasure
to
drink
so
balanced
and
high
on
flavors
yet
not
overboard
simply
world
class
right
up
there
with
celebrator
yet
very
different
in
flavors
great
doppelbock
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
dark
brown
but
not
opaque
with
a
creamy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
of
dark
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
it
smells
clean
and
sweet
and
the
alcohol
does
not
come
through
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
fantastic
the
flavor
of
dark
roasted
malt
is
very
rich
and
creamy
it
is
mildly
sweet
like
caramel
and
there
is
some
chocolate
flavor
to
this
as
well
the
alcohol
also
does
not
punch
through
in
the
taste
despite
being
so
rich
in
flavor
the
flavor
is
also
clean
and
not
cloying
the
body
is
full
and
the
beer
is
creamy
your
tongue
lets
you
know
youre
drinking
a
big
beer
but
its
so
clean
in
the
finish
that
this
is
extremely
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
this
is
a
doppelbock
you
should
try
if
youve
never
had
a
doppelbock
its
very
satisfying
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
has
a
great
mix
of
fruit
and
malt
i
get
some
nice
cherry
grape
and
prune
notes
as
well
as
some
heavy
toffee
the
flavor
is
very
similar
there
is
a
ton
of
toffee
and
caramel
as
well
as
some
cherry
and
grape
characteristics
the
body
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
expected
but
it
does
have
a
very
nice
clean
lager
taste
medium
carbonation
o
best
doppelbock
ive
ever
had
and
you
cannot
go
wrong
with
a
weihnenstephaner
beer
in
my
opinion
o
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
an
excellent
doppelbock
will
seek
out
in
july
when
it
joins
the
other
weihenstephaner
products
mississippi
carries
highly
recommended
for
malt
lovers
overall
my
2nd
foray
into
european
double
bocks
and
this
ones
a
bit
disappointing
while
i
greatly
enjoyed
ayinger
celebrator
this
one
is
similar
but
scaled
back
by
comparison
very
sweet
not
much
balance
ive
found
weihensthephaner
a
powerhouse
with
their
wheat
beers
but
this
double
bock
doesnt
quite
make
the
grade
not
a
bad
beer
overall
but
i
think
the
ayinger
has
spoiled
me
in
the
double
bock
department
if
i
had
to
describe
this
one
in
two
words
itd
be
sugar
beer
medium
body
and
carbonation
with
a
semidry
finish
not
bad
certainly
but
not
amongst
the
best
examples
of
the
style
or
the
best
beers
by
this
revered
brewery
who
can
do
no
wrong
when
wheat
is
involved
bought
a
500ml
bottle
of
this
from
a
department
store
in
bangkok
poured
into
a
paulaner
weizen
glass
a
mysterious
algae
dark
brown
hue
to
the
brew
with
not
much
of
a
head
on
it
the
smell
was
a
bit
lacking
in
complexity
for
me
but
it
did
have
notes
of
caramel
wood
and
chocolate
in
it
the
taste
was
spot
on
for
a
doppelbock
serving
nicely
to
a
dinner
of
dark
meats
or
with
dessert
however
possibly
due
to
its
bottled
form
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
bit
overly
carbonated
resulting
in
some
initial
excess
gas
it
also
made
my
stomach
gurgle
for
about
a
half
hour
after
finishing
the
brew
overall
i
love
weihenstephans
brews
but
when
im
searching
for
a
doppelbock
i
might
look
elsewhere
ill
stick
to
their
hefes
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
while
it
doesnt
push
the
limits
in
the
exciting
department
you
can
still
taste
the
quality
ingredients
id
have
no
issues
drinking
this
one
again
o
i
really
like
this
malty
big
strong
beer
this
is
my
go
to
dopplebock
rjt
d
complex
and
extremely
smooth
the
malt
profile
is
really
nice
o
delicious
liquid
sustenance
indeed
pours
very
dark
brown
with
reddish
highlights
and
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
aroma
distinct
of
german
malts
chocolate
brown
sugar
and
yeast
moderately
thick
mouth
surprisingly
robust
and
complex
maltiness
the
wheat
is
distinctive
breadiness
along
with
tones
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
lot
weihenstephner
has
done
it
again
sehr
gutes
bier
thin
off
white
head
a
little
lacing
on
a
dark
brown
body
aroma
is
extremely
malty
as
if
i
am
walking
through
the
brewery
very
nice
aroma
flavor
is
also
very
malty
and
sweet
very
smooth
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
very
good
i
have
not
had
a
malty
beet
to
this
degree
this
beer
us
very
true
to
the
style
and
i
will
be
looking
to
have
this
one
again
soon
the
spices
i
looke
for
in
my
bocks
arent
there
as
they
seen
to
be
overshadowed
by
the
maltiness
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
fair
initial
appearance
with
some
nice
persistent
lacing
great
sweet
malty
syrupy
nose
flavor
is
a
robust
combo
of
thick
syrupy
sweet
malty
goodness
with
a
and
a
pungent
bittersweet
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
o
a
very
unique
dopplebock
with
its
complex
beadywheaty
flavor
definitely
worth
trying
vary
flavorful
with
a
brilliant
aroma
o
very
belgianesque
for
a
german
lager
i
buy
this
a
lot
never
disappoints
korbinian
is
a
solid
doppelbock
with
rich
flavor
but
maybe
a
little
too
much
alcohol
o
a
tasty
cool
weather
beverage
weihenstephaner
truly
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
they
have
regular
releases
that
i
would
love
to
drink
at
anytime
of
the
year
this
is
another
nice
roasted
malts
and
fruitiness
hops
are
hard
to
come
by
but
this
is
a
satisfying
brew
o
a
great
beer
at
a
reasonable
price
can
only
imagine
how
good
it
is
on
tap
will
continue
to
get
on
a
regular
basis
walnut
brown
in
color
with
an
amber
hue
and
good
clarity
poured
with
a
short
beige
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
well
balanced
blend
of
sweet
dark
roasted
malt
toffee
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
aromas
with
ripe
fruity
aromas
at
the
end
creamy
smooth
delicate
feel
with
light
but
rich
carbonation
roasted
malt
and
toffee
flavors
up
front
floral
hops
and
ripe
dark
fruit
through
the
middle
and
to
the
finish
finishes
with
a
lingering
light
floral
hop
bitterness
a
plethora
of
aromas
and
flavors
with
a
delicate
lager
feel
awesome
overall
this
is
perfect
for
the
style
and
coming
from
such
a
highly
regarded
weizenbock
and
hefeweizen
i
can
see
why
this
is
so
awesome
truly
the
best
quality
and
price
for
the
style
o
an
excellent
dopplebock
o
i
dont
think
this
old
brewery
can
make
a
bad
product
this
is
no
exception
o
the
raisin
bread
like
taste
is
a
nice
touch
and
it
is
just
overall
a
very
solid
beer
at
3
bucks
a
bottle
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
will
drink
many
times
its
not
just
about
the
price
though
this
is
a
great
beer
love
this
beer
full
of
delicious
flavor
creamy
mouthfeel
nicely
balanced
with
the
hops
flawless
o
good
would
not
label
it
great
but
good
all
5s
mean
a
beer
cannot
improve
anymore
i
dont
see
how
this
one
can
improve
to
style
go
get
some
now
and
understand
doppelbock
o
hello
im
malt
guy
i
like
this
a
lot
certainly
enjoying
this
one
seems
like
a
rather
classic
example
of
the
style
o
a
real
treat
would
love
to
have
this
one
fresh
a
really
good
beer
nicely
done
perfect
to
warm
up
the
toes
on
a
nice
winter
day
an
excellent
excellant
beer
overall
4
5
this
is
a
beer
that
as
a
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
dopplebock
i
would
imagine
it
would
match
perfectly
with
german
cuisine
but
i
would
recommend
it
the
way
i
enjoyed
it
in
front
of
a
fire
on
a
cold
winters
night
im
sure
st
stephen
would
agree
notes
why
no
ator
suffix
in
the
name
i
think
this
is
the
first
doppelbock
ive
ever
encountered
that
did
not
keep
with
this
tradition
note
im
always
worried
about
norms
and
percentages
but
let
me
give
the
right
kind
of
credit
where
its
due
i
upped
the
taste
rating
to
5
watchin
jeopardy
and
drinkin
german
brews
good
times
this
one
pours
a
sunset
siennaamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
barley
right
out
of
a
malt
bag
and
walnut
nuttier
rawer
than
i
expected
but
not
bad
the
taste
holds
notes
of
fluffy
toffee
buttery
biscuit
very
light
roasted
malts
light
chocolate
powder
and
a
touch
of
sourdough
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
silky
feel
overall
a
very
nice
dbock
perhaps
not
the
best
ive
had
but
a
strong
offering
regardless
a
dark
brown
but
clear
appearance
in
the
glass
with
little
head
and
little
carbonation
a
sweet
chocolate
and
caramel
aroma
with
a
hint
of
citrus
i
said
orange
others
said
lemon
not
surprisingly
with
most
doppelbocks
i
drink
the
taste
came
with
heavy
notes
of
chocolate
and
smoke
what
i
love
about
this
brew
over
others
is
that
there
is
no
rough
aftertaste
its
an
amazingly
smooth
beer
an
instant
favorite
i
drove
down
the
autobahn
and
grabbed
up
the
last
case
o
perfectly
balanced
despite
the
dominant
sweetness
drinkabilty
is
in
fact
amazing
for
the
abv
warming
and
complex
at
the
same
time
excellent
beer
notes
this
is
a
great
dopplebock
a
dam
tasty
beer
with
a
great
malty
backbone
cheers
overall
i
have
enjoyed
these
for
some
time
and
will
continue
staying
stocked
up
for
the
meager
price
you
get
an
incredible
worldclass
german
dopplebock
i
deffinitely
recommend
this
beer
and
i
really
enjoy
how
easily
it
pairs
with
so
many
different
foods
overall
a
great
beer
its
balanced
it
fits
the
style
it
looks
great
smells
great
what
else
can
i
say
buy
a
couple
das
korbinian
i
loved
this
beer
at
one
time
then
i
stopped
drinking
for
awhile
then
i
got
the
wheels
greased
again
back
about
a
1
5
years
or
so
and
never
gravitated
towards
a
doppelbock
its
not
my
favorite
style
i
tend
towards
american
ales
of
extreme
flavors
these
days
and
the
occasional
lambic
or
belgian
pale
or
tripel
crosses
my
lips
i
remember
liking
it
but
earlier
in
the
evening
i
took
a
sip
right
after
opening
and
was
horrified
having
gotten
home
after
a
night
out
with
friends
this
tastes
great
not
due
to
my
intoxication
level
but
rather
the
pleasant
subtlety
of
this
beer
good
brown
brew
not
a
damn
thing
wrong
with
it
really
i
could
see
the
style
being
pushed
a
bit
further
as
is
in
the
case
of
celebrator
but
this
is
an
easy
drinking
foamsizzling
malty
not
overly
complex
brown
beer
that
has
a
sturdy
abv
and
a
noble
lable
das
koribinian
o
i
enjoy
this
beer
much
more
than
other
doppelbocks
however
because
of
its
sweetness
its
something
ill
drink
only
every
now
and
again
and
ill
stop
after
one
o
a
fantastic
doppelbock
final
thoughts
think
a
thin
piece
of
fruit
caramel
covered
in
semisweet
dipping
chocolate
then
think
beer
with
it
and
thats
what
its
like
but
not
as
sweet
very
nice
beer
and
a
little
bit
different
from
your
average
brew
i
really
like
it
and
its
somewhere
between
easy
drinking
and
too
heavy
for
another
one
making
it
a
great
beer
to
have
a
couple
but
certainly
not
a
session
beer
that
you
would
want
to
have
a
lot
of
especially
because
of
the
alcohol
content
taste
notes
the
base
of
the
toasted
malt
tries
to
stealthily
creep
by
but
the
roasted
toffee
like
notes
betray
their
presence
a
rich
chocolate
spreads
its
patina
of
flavor
across
the
tongue
alcohol
cannot
hide
either
a
deep
cordial
of
esthers
wafts
before
a
burnt
brown
sugar
toffee
caps
off
a
stunning
drinking
experience
this
is
amazing
stunning
outstanding
o
a
nice
example
of
a
traditional
german
doppelbock
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
but
good
nonetheless
full
bodied
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
oa
really
nice
beer
give
this
a
chance
you
would
be
dumb
not
to
count
this
rich
lager
among
the
gateway
beers
to
craftbeer
advocacy
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
that
is
satisfying
and
filling
sweet
creamy
and
rich
oout
of
all
the
weihenstephaners
this
might
be
my
least
favorite
but
its
still
a
good
and
worthy
beer
to
try
its
definitely
one
of
the
best
dark
germans
that
ive
had
its
still
probably
not
something
ill
be
wanting
again
though
odoverall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
more
and
more
after
every
sip
chocolate
sneaks
up
on
you
smoother
and
creamier
than
other
doppelbocks
i
have
had
i
have
very
very
limited
experience
with
the
style
but
i
like
this
one
only
2
79
for
a
decent
sized
bottle
i
am
in
love
with
this
beer
appearance
is
like
root
beer
or
sarsaparilla
dark
brown
but
clear
enough
to
see
through
with
zero
cloudiness
smells
of
prune
pumpernickel
brown
sugar
with
a
sweet
bright
hint
of
a
hops
layer
skimming
the
top
flavor
is
great
the
pruneish
fruit
is
well
expressed
but
not
dominant
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
are
obvious
i
also
get
spice
and
herbs
pepper
white
pepper
and
mint
really
stand
out
a
near
perfect
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
real
treat
smooth
with
crispy
carbonation
that
bursts
a
bit
as
it
compresses
for
the
swallow
it
really
sparkles
for
a
dark
heavy
beer
id
almost
say
its
refreshing
its
a
great
accomplishment
the
flavor
of
a
bold
beer
with
the
crispness
of
a
much
lighter
brew
high
abv
is
hardly
noticeable
with
all
the
flavor
going
on
just
an
all
around
winner
seek
it
out
overall
a
great
beer
definitely
tastes
and
smells
like
it
has
some
asian
green
teablack
tea
influences
have
found
this
one
varies
so
make
sure
you
get
it
within
its
best
by
date
exactly
what
i
expected
from
a
german
doppelbock
and
its
weihenstephaner
nothing
but
the
best
mouth
feel
is
nice
it
is
smooth
taste
growing
after
the
first
zip
but
nothing
too
strong
like
with
some
smokey
german
beers
very
delicious
beer
more
complex
than
a
straight
forward
malt
bomb
and
just
really
really
tasty
must
try
beer
prost
o
its
a
great
rep
of
the
style
definitely
a
random
buy
its
a
solid
brew
for
cool
evenings
im
just
not
the
biggest
fan
of
bocks
in
general
but
this
one
played
a
nice
change
of
pace
role
rain
delay
excellent
and
refined
go
buy
some
and
set
aside
90
minutes
to
finish
the
pint
bottle
this
was
phenomenally
drinkable
and
just
superbly
done
how
did
i
not
know
about
this
one
sooner
500
ml
bottle
pours
dark
redbrownish
hue
with
a
tanned
long
lasting
head
aroma
is
of
caramel
floral
hops
and
hints
of
cherry
medium
velvety
body
toasted
malt
caramel
and
cherry
fruit
balanced
on
the
palate
by
floral
hops
and
burned
coffee
long
dry
coffee
finish
it
is
not
the
best
german
dopple
bock
but
it
is
definitely
up
there
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
beige
head
that
left
a
bit
lacing
behind
toasty
bread
aroma
malts
and
hints
of
cocoa
and
dried
fruit
crisp
and
toasty
taste
sweet
malts
cocoa
and
nuts
keeping
it
from
being
too
sweet
hints
of
raisins
in
the
finish
a
bit
light
in
flavor
and
body
for
the
style
i
thought
but
still
a
fine
quaff
my
notes
finish
with
the
phrase
classic
excellence
overall
a
solid
doppelbock
and
a
great
version
of
the
style
i
will
defiantly
be
picking
this
one
up
more
in
the
future
i
rate
this
as
something
everyone
should
try
as
its
pretty
accessible
if
you
find
stores
such
as
specs
which
i
picked
up
for
2
99
or
somewhere
similar
wherever
you
are
i
must
be
honest
with
the
bas
as
a
raving
fan
of
the
weihenstephaner
hefe
i
admit
i
was
pulling
for
this
bock
against
the
celebrated
ayinger
bottom
line
i
adore
both
the
celebrator
is
as
adveritsed
but
i
found
the
korbinian
atomic
lets
just
call
it
a
draw
between
two
phenomenal
breweries
glad
to
be
able
to
access
both
here
in
southern
california
this
is
a
really
great
doppel
even
though
its
too
sweet
to
be
perfect
this
is
just
another
example
that
american
brewers
have
nothing
on
long
standing
tradition
only
found
in
europe
o
overall
another
great
dopplebock
i
think
it
is
missing
some
of
the
overall
clean
character
that
you
find
in
celebrator
but
still
delicious
overall
a
pretty
nice
doppelbock
and
one
that
i
would
enjoy
on
many
occasions
its
no
celebrator
though
o
another
good
offering
from
weihenstephan
the
abv
kicked
in
a
bit
and
was
noticeable
as
i
was
drinking
it
which
i
dont
really
like
but
nevertheless
its
a
good
beer
o
i
like
this
beer
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
a
lot
going
for
it
a
bit
understated
on
the
flavor
but
there
is
some
complexity
so
its
definitely
worth
a
try
o
a
great
doppelbock
has
a
great
fruity
malty
aroma
and
a
strong
roasty
malt
flavor
that
stays
in
your
mouth
long
after
youve
finished
do
very
easy
drinking
for
the
style
first
off
that
only
works
to
korbinians
advantage
here
world
class
yes
are
there
other
dopplebocks
right
up
there
with
it
yes
o
well
done
a
beer
you
could
fast
with
wellbalanced
and
great
tasting
i
like
it
about
as
well
as
the
andechser
doppelbock
dunkel
and
the
ayinger
celebrator
doppelbock
d
great
standalone
ber
for
winter
or
fall
another
great
beer
from
weihenstephaneri
wish
i
could
find
this
in
the
twin
cities
cuz
this
would
definitiely
be
a
go
to
doppelbock
o
you
remember
toffifay
its
to
good
for
kids
the
caramel
choclate
hazelnut
cups
from
germany
thats
what
came
to
mind
while
drinking
this
beer
the
complexity
of
the
sweet
flavors
is
excellent
i
really
like
this
beer
a
lot
overall
a
tad
dissapointing
given
other
scoresreviews
decent
little
beer
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
me
o
overall
it
is
a
classic
take
on
the
style
and
another
example
of
this
brewerys
brilliance
a
rich
fulfilling
and
extremely
delicious
beer
that
cant
be
missed
overall
i
enjoyed
the
fact
that
this
one
wasnt
too
sweet
didnt
pick
up
much
alcohol
at
all
the
sweetness
did
dominate
the
smell
a
bit
much
but
overall
a
very
good
beer
o
ive
been
tossing
these
back
like
its
going
out
of
style
but
when
its
on
the
bosses
dime
the
first
time
around
and
half
off
the
rest
why
not
this
is
a
great
doppelbock
and
its
a
classic
for
a
reason
poured
from
bottle
into
beer
stein
mug
pours
a
very
dark
but
clear
amber
with
a
thick
white
head
that
leaves
a
sold
lace
collar
the
nose
is
dark
malt
with
a
good
amount
of
brown
sugar
and
chocolate
with
just
a
hint
of
spicy
yeast
the
flavor
is
a
little
lighter
and
more
nuanced
with
milk
chocolate
and
malty
bitterness
and
the
same
yeast
flavor
displayed
on
the
nose
the
body
is
medium
with
average
carbonation
and
a
long
bitter
and
chocolate
finish
very
nice
doppelbock
if
not
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
representation
of
the
style
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
cream
brown
colored
head
solid
lacing
and
retention
throughout
aroma
of
candied
fruit
caramelized
sugar
coco
and
dark
fruit
explosion
of
malt
flavor
big
roasted
caramel
malt
candied
sugar
sticky
toffee
hints
of
dark
fruit
coco
and
some
dry
roastyness
to
finish
sticky
thick
mouthfeel
in
this
well
crafted
classic
malty
doppelbock
o
i
havent
had
many
but
this
easily
ranks
among
the
best
doppelbocks
ive
tried
the
flavor
profile
is
just
different
enough
to
really
stand
out
if
it
popped
a
bit
more
id
probably
have
a
new
favorite
pretty
fin
good
smells
like
caramel
tastes
thick
and
sweet
reminds
me
of
a
hot
chocolate
made
with
cream
instead
of
milk
head
is
a
bid
thin
but
who
cares
so
convicingly
drinkable
with
no
alcohol
taste
at
7
4
and
very
little
hops
malt
bomb
i
better
work
this
one
off
so
i
can
have
some
more
das
good
o
ive
been
trying
more
doppelbocks
recently
and
this
one
sticks
out
to
me
there
might
not
be
anything
exceptional
about
the
taste
but
it
is
damn
good
and
its
character
is
unique
and
interesting
to
me
i
could
drink
this
all
day
by
the
way
seems
to
be
more
like
a
session
beer
to
me
than
a
sipper
although
watch
the
7
4
overall
really
liked
this
beer
and
this
style
o
pretty
good
a
little
heavy
but
has
a
deep
flavor
profile
with
a
nice
sweetness
the
heavy
body
makes
it
a
little
harder
to
drink
i
poured
it
from
a
bottle
as
well
into
my
aventinus
weizenbock
glass
it
poured
a
dark
deep
reddish
tint
with
a
slight
head
that
dissipated
quickly
when
i
took
a
good
sniff
of
this
complex
beer
i
got
a
nose
of
roasted
malts
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
was
similar
to
the
nose
of
this
beer
i
tasted
the
roasted
malts
the
dark
fruits
like
figs
prunesi
couldnt
really
put
my
tongue
on
it
and
some
chocolate
undertones
the
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
to
full
body
doppelbock
that
hides
the
7
4
abv
well
that
makes
it
quite
dangerous
since
i
could
keep
drinking
this
there
is
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
one
of
the
worlds
top
doppelbocks
i
maybe
biased
because
doppelbocks
are
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
this
is
a
fine
specimen
of
one
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
out
there
its
to
style
its
weihenstephaner
its
a
proper
dark
german
beer
and
at
the
price
3
50
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
would
pair
well
with
bratwurst
and
lederhosen
the
korbinian
is
amazingly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
my
glass
went
far
too
fast
id
fast
for
lent
too
if
you
gave
me
a
steady
stream
of
these
its
a
good
deal
at
3
49
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
got
it
on
a
whim
i
liked
that
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
had
deeper
flavors
then
most
bocks
i
have
tasted
but
not
too
much
to
overwhelm
my
meal
a
good
buy
for
3
27
and
will
get
again
o
great
beer
a
bit
filling
to
drink
a
lot
of
in
one
sitting
this
might
be
a
regular
for
me
got
for
only
2
99
a
bottle
overall
coming
down
to
it
this
is
a
great
doppelbock
but
still
wasnt
the
best
maybe
after
having
the
celebrator
twice
in
a
month
im
hinting
towards
this
awesome
bock
drinkability
was
easy
for
a
7
4
beer
and
thought
it
was
a
great
german
lager
i
had
many
weihenstephaners
while
i
was
both
in
austria
and
germany
but
i
didnt
take
notes
and
til
this
day
cant
remember
much
of
them
except
i
enjoyed
them
greatly
ready
to
try
another
one
overall
a
solid
example
of
the
style
and
a
good
value
o
very
pleasant
beer
if
it
was
cheaper
this
would
be
a
nice
easy
drinker
nothing
outrageous
but
a
very
well
made
beer
fullbodied
with
strong
carbonation
this
beer
coats
your
mouth
but
doesnt
get
too
sticky
the
carbonation
may
be
a
little
excessive
as
it
seems
to
get
in
the
way
of
some
of
the
flavors
but
it
does
prevent
a
potentially
syrupy
mouthfeel
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
doppelbock
it
was
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
encountered
during
my
doppelbock
binge
and
the
best
german
one
i
have
had
yet
everything
about
this
style
was
on
point
and
about
where
it
should
be
it
may
not
be
as
flavorful
as
some
of
the
american
ones
but
it
makes
up
for
that
by
being
smooth
as
hell
and
having
some
great
drinkability
i
will
be
buying
this
again
and
will
be
on
the
look
out
for
any
other
beers
by
weihenstephaner
if
you
like
doppelbocks
give
this
one
a
try
its
a
great
traditional
german
doppelbock
and
it
gives
you
a
good
feel
for
what
this
style
is
all
about
overall
this
beer
is
just
very
impressive
it
feels
like
chocolate
banana
sundae
topping
all
i
feel
like
doing
is
having
a
chocolate
ice
cream
banana
split
with
this
on
the
side
even
though
i
hate
bananas
winner
right
here
folks
o
highly
drinkable
beer
and
recommended
very
drinkable
without
any
alcohol
bit
despite
7
4
i
wish
i
had
another
chilled
now
one
word
to
define
this
beer
is
excellent
very
good
drinkable
and
solid
brew
from
the
eldest
weihenstephan
i
could
not
drink
this
all
night
as
it
lacks
a
degree
of
complexity
it
has
a
determined
profile
that
may
well
fell
the
unwary
d
this
is
quite
delicious
id
definitely
recommend
this
to
someone
looking
for
a
dark
fairly
sweet
beer
really
phenomenal
example
nice
chewy
mouthfeel
big
full
body
delicious
brew
a
great
beer
well
put
together
it
might
be
a
toss
up
between
paulaners
salvator
and
this
one
i
enjoyed
it
with
a
nice
5
year
old
gouda
but
i
think
it
will
suit
many
occasions
especially
post
dinner
ones
so
if
youre
in
the
market
for
a
doppelbock
this
is
a
winner
o
as
with
anything
weihenstephaner
does
im
a
fan
definitely
one
of
the
better
brews
they
do
but
not
one
of
my
personal
favorites
by
them
definitely
a
very
good
doppelbock
but
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
while
doublebock
has
never
been
a
favorite
style
of
mine
i
find
this
example
to
be
excellent
and
would
gladly
have
it
again
ulike
some
american
examples
of
the
style
this
is
a
smoother
more
balanced
doublebock
that
is
not
trying
to
shock
your
tongue
but
is
instead
happy
to
allow
the
subtlies
of
a
year
of
brewing
residue
flavor
this
beer
i
highly
recommend
especially
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
doublebock
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
very
intense
and
very
complex
but
unlike
many
of
the
intense
and
complex
beers
ive
had
in
the
past
i
feel
like
i
should
get
some
cheese
bread
and
a
bottle
of
korbinian
and
make
it
my
dinner
for
a
night
d
despite
its
strength
i
rate
this
high
because
its
not
cloying
and
complex
enough
to
make
you
want
to
keep
drinking
it
to
figure
out
all
the
flavors
remarkable
job
by
a
remarkable
brewery
incredibly
rich
with
a
thick
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
of
coffee
and
roasted
malt
with
a
slight
sweetness
and
caramel
flavors
in
the
after
taste
korbinian
pours
a
deep
brown
with
plentiful
cherry
highlights
shining
through
the
khaki
colored
head
rises
to
about
three
fingers
in
height
it
quickly
dissipated
to
about
two
thirds
of
its
top
height
but
some
serious
head
retention
kicks
in
from
that
point
on
lacing
is
decent
but
just
a
little
too
patchwork
to
really
finish
off
the
look
the
nose
has
sufficiently
whet
my
appetite
a
wonderful
blend
of
toasted
nuts
and
caramel
the
flavor
then
manages
to
surpass
my
expectations
by
adding
a
distinct
biscuity
note
to
the
nutty
foundation
and
bringing
cocoa
into
the
fold
as
a
second
auxiliary
flavor
to
add
a
very
nice
flourish
i
want
to
give
it
a
perfect
5
for
flavor
but
i
think
a
touch
of
dark
fruits
could
elevate
korbinian
even
more
the
body
is
impressively
slick
and
as
pronounced
as
one
would
expect
for
such
a
malt
forward
beer
the
cabronation
though
is
a
bit
overdone
and
i
find
it
occasionally
distracting
from
all
the
malty
goodness
weihenstephaners
crafted
a
great
beer
in
korbinian
its
one
id
gladly
welcome
back
to
my
glass
anytime
m
medium
body
and
absolutely
no
astringet
despite
the
abv
d
devilishly
drinkable
at
7
4
abv
this
is
a
doppelbock
that
was
great
on
its
own
and
paired
very
well
with
my
bavarian
pretzel
and
wholegrain
ale
mustard
a
bargain
too
5
at
mikro
i
would
pick
this
or
aventinus
over
tap
selections
almost
any
day
pours
a
nice
chocolate
color
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
which
dissipates
almost
immediately
smells
very
hearty
like
yeasty
bread
with
caramel
malts
poured
all
over
it
and
the
taste
doesnt
disappoint
extremely
prominent
is
the
malt
hinted
at
in
the
nose
but
ultimately
the
flavor
of
dark
liquorish
dominates
the
taste
knocking
out
any
attempt
the
bitterness
makes
to
come
through
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
with
minimal
carbonation
and
a
little
bit
oily
which
taken
together
is
extremely
pleasant
almost
tastes
like
a
homebrew
that
hasnt
completed
its
bottle
carbonation
respectable
abv
but
for
this
one
id
hang
up
the
car
keys
and
enjoy
a
few
at
home
especially
for
the
price
d
overall
this
is
a
very
good
doppelbock
with
an
amazing
mouthfeel
felt
like
i
could
have
had
a
few
of
these
would
have
again
16
9oz
brown
bottle
purchased
at
mckinnons
in
salem
pours
a
crystalclear
dark
brown
body
with
a
good
inch
or
so
of
light
tan
head
dark
chocolate
ripe
dates
caramel
brown
sugar
pears
dark
chocolate
nut
caramel
brown
sugar
coffee
and
pear
comprise
the
flavor
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinks
better
than
a
beer
this
heavy
and
complex
has
any
right
to
the
best
dopplebock
i
have
ever
had
this
beer
is
world
class
it
is
at
the
very
upper
end
of
medium
bodied
almost
getting
to
full
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
but
definitely
good
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
doppelbocks
but
enjoyed
this
look
forward
to
trying
again
pretty
damn
good
stuff
really
drinkable
for
the
style
back
before
i
moved
beyond
american
beer
youd
find
at
the
711
this
is
what
my
first
michelob
amberbock
tasted
like
i
could
have
sworn
in
past
years
the
stuff
seemed
to
get
more
and
more
watery
and
flavorless
however
this
recaptured
that
magic
from
the
first
time
i
had
a
bock
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
1
5
inch
tan
head
into
a
pint
glass
smelled
a
bit
like
soy
sauce
and
rum
raisins
tastes
like
spiced
fruits
and
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
had
a
nice
carbonation
and
was
very
easy
to
drink
if
i
can
get
this
in
a
boot
at
the
pub
i
will
for
sure
overall
an
excellent
doppelbock
if
you
are
a
fan
of
lagers
then
this
is
a
musttry
drinkability
a
truly
tasty
doppelbock
overall
i
was
impressed
by
this
offering
by
weihenstephaner
but
they
have
yet
to
dissapoint
me
i
ordered
a
pint
of
this
on
draft
at
stuff
yer
face
eatery
in
brunswick
nj
near
rutgers
campus
double
bock
nice
and
dark
good
flavor
it
sneaks
up
on
you
i
felt
the
buzz
and
guessed
the
abv
to
be
around
7
5
it
went
well
with
the
chicken
stromboli
i
ate
ill
definitely
seek
this
out
again
what
can
you
say
one
of
the
classic
german
doppels
cant
go
wrong
absolutely
no
detectable
alcohol
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
a
good
beer
though
represents
the
style
well
d
this
is
probably
the
best
doppelbock
around
germans
make
platonic
beersreinheitsgebot
and
beyond
this
is
one
of
those
definitive
drinks
drinkability
delicious
fairly
well
balanced
a
one
and
done
beer
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
that
is
refreshing
in
the
winter
very
nice
drinkability
poured
from
a
bottle
into
my
weihenstephan
0
5l
hefeweizen
glass
definitely
a
highquality
beer
from
a
brewery
i
love
but
not
really
all
that
enjoyable
impressive
color
and
aroma
a
little
watery
in
mouthfeel
and
the
oddest
flavor
ive
ever
tasted
in
a
beer
others
have
described
it
as
extreme
malt
with
some
sweetness
but
i
really
think
it
could
be
better
described
as
tasting
like
watereddown
soy
sauce
with
honey
not
a
terrible
beer
but
definitely
not
anywhere
close
to
my
favorites
o
still
a
good
beer
but
a
notch
below
salvator
tastes
more
like
a
landbier
dunkel
as
the
menu
i
ordered
from
in
germany
said
to
me
very
clean
and
crisp
flavors
just
would
have
liked
more
d
surprisingly
drinkable
for
the
general
body
and
sweetness
but
it
is
so
large
that
it
can
be
nice
and
a
real
sipper
the
lower
carbonation
does
hurt
the
general
drinkability
d
very
drinkable
wellrounded
doppelbock
would
not
realize
that
this
brew
was
7
4
alcohol
by
volume
based
on
the
taste
alone
another
great
beer
by
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
conclusion
this
is
a
different
take
on
the
style
from
its
direct
competitor
celebrator
doppelbock
more
subtle
creamy
and
quietly
strong
than
the
more
bold
but
still
refined
malty
flavors
of
that
beer
this
is
so
good
nothing
i
have
tasted
from
this
oldest
brewery
on
earth
has
failed
to
impress
me
d
like
most
doppelbocks
i
find
this
one
extremely
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
quite
subtle
and
it
goes
down
smooth
definitely
a
beer
i
will
seek
out
in
the
future
a
nice
doppelbock
well
worth
keeping
an
eye
out
for
great
beer
but
it
doesnt
top
the
list
like
celebrator
certainly
a
contender
worthy
of
its
position
and
close
distance
to
the
great
ayinger
doppelbock
very
drinkable
this
is
my
first
korbinian
in
a
long
time
and
i
really
should
drink
more
of
this
absolutely
fantastic
beer
the
initial
taste
included
malts
and
raisins
the
mouthful
was
punctuated
by
a
strong
fruity
finish
that
lingered
for
a
few
moments
drinkability
was
sound
and
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
excellent
beverage
by
all
measures
fit
for
a
kings
banquet
of
rich
foods
and
dessert
i
love
this
meaty
doppelbock
rich
color
and
pour
lots
of
fruit
and
even
a
hint
of
carmel
it
was
a
wonderful
variety
from
weihenstephaner
a
true
bavarian
doppel
i
drank
it
with
hot
nuts
no
comments
please
and
some
other
finger
food
very
good
pair
with
savory
foods
i
will
be
on
a
search
to
find
this
at
my
store
great
high
abv
too
just
right
for
a
winter
night
d
fairly
drinkable
the
char
is
a
little
heavy
for
the
style
but
overall
very
enjoyable
at
first
taste
the
flavor
was
a
bit
offputting
in
the
way
it
all
came
together
as
it
was
a
bit
different
than
anything
else
i
had
experienced
after
i
was
able
to
taste
it
a
few
times
though
i
was
able
to
really
appreciate
the
the
different
complexities
and
the
way
they
blended
together
tasty
malt
flavor
with
some
dark
fruit
and
nice
hint
of
chocolate
at
the
end
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
smooth
mouthfeel
with
light
carbonation
very
easy
to
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
from
a
world
class
brewery
d
this
is
one
fine
beer
definitely
would
get
again
the
feel
is
fairly
thick
and
the
carbonation
is
just
right
even
better
warmed
up
i
would
call
drinkability
above
average
as
i
do
all
doppelbocks
a
half
liter
will
hold
me
for
some
time
good
for
not
being
one
of
my
preferred
styles
pours
an
almost
purple
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
thick
foamy
white
head
and
tons
of
lacing
smells
of
yeast
bread
and
tons
of
malts
tastes
of
sweet
malts
yeast
bread
and
a
little
prune
or
plum
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
carbonation
is
light
drinkability
is
medium
drinkability
easily
one
of
my
favorite
beers
after
the
first
bottle
wonderful
taste
and
absolutely
undetectable
alcohol
presence
for
such
a
high
abv
my
only
complaint
would
be
that
i
cant
seem
to
find
this
in
6
packs
if
you
like
dark
beers
this
is
a
must
try
smell
d
a
very
solid
doppelbock
great
flavors
and
deceptively
easy
to
drink
despite
a
pretty
sizable
abv
a
deep
brown
almost
black
with
light
brown
hues
a
decent
two
finger
head
a
small
amount
of
thin
lacing
remains
on
the
rim
of
the
beer
the
nose
is
heavy
on
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
fantastic
chocolate
roasted
malts
a
touch
of
caramel
a
slightbitterness
on
the
finish
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
thin
i
could
have
used
a
bit
more
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
very
clean
and
crisp
roasted
malt
flavors
dopplebocks
are
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
because
those
clean
flavors
brought
out
through
the
lagering
at
this
price
i
might
have
a
new
beer
to
add
to
the
regular
list
d
excellent
this
is
a
great
lager
that
i
would
highly
recommend
d
it
is
good
but
not
near
my
favorite
beer
abv
is
a
bit
higher
but
not
crazy
drinkability
an
excellent
and
very
well
crafted
brew
i
think
it
is
the
definition
of
smooth
the
flavor
complexity
emerges
slowly
and
clearly
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
with
a
robust
tan
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
not
too
much
lacing
going
on
malts
and
grains
in
the
nose
smells
of
toasted
maple
syrup
raisins
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
malty
sweet
very
powerful
taste
theres
a
slight
alcohol
taste
but
is
overpowered
by
a
toasty
fruit
taste
this
beer
has
it
all
dark
sugars
toasted
malts
fruits
chocolates
and
a
minimal
hops
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
and
perfect
carbonation
washes
over
the
palate
with
elegance
the
only
thing
that
would
keep
me
drinking
this
all
night
is
the
high
abv
the
flavor
is
strong
but
just
so
delicious
it
keeps
you
wanting
more
and
more
overall
this
is
a
simplistic
and
satisfying
doppelbock
as
the
label
suggests
the
brews
recipe
adheres
to
the

while
watching
the
sf
giants
pitter
away
their
season
we
find
this
gem
clearn
deep
dark
mahogany
not
much
of
a
head
decent
carbonation
and
little
to
no
lacing
extremely
robust
aroma
of
heavy
raosted
malt
some
mettalic
notes
some
molasses
maybe
even
maple
syrup
pretty
great
smelling
and
quite
spot
on
to
style
great
flavor
upfront
very
rich
and
full
in
the
mouth
great
roasty
punch
in
the
gut
like
watching
zito
walk
in
two
runs
in
the
first
inning
of
a
title
clinching
game
beautiful
but
loses
it
near
the
end
unlike
zito
who
apparently
never
has
it
to
begin
with
thin
finish
and
the
unpleasant
metallic
notes
show
up
more
nice
long
toasty
finish
kind
of
like
what
the
padres
will
apparently
receive
after
tomorrow
nights
game
after
the
giants
choke
and
lose
three
straight
to
get
the
boot
if
not
for
the
thin
finish
this
would
be
great
as
it
is
its
merely
good
decently
priced
at
2
99halfliter
so
that
brings
the
drinkability
up
some
and
were
gonna
need
it
after
todays
game
tasty
beer
but
the
combo
of
high
alcohol
and
it
being
medium
bodied
you
could
probably
have
2
tops
before
youre
full
all
the
sweetness
and
malty
flavors
make
it
feel
like
its
a
meal
in
a
bottle
personally
id
just
have
one
definitely
would
have
it
again
but
doubt
ill
go
outta
my
way
to
buy
a
bottle
the
korbinian
and
the
aventinus
are
in
close
competition
for
my
favorite
german
export
of
any
kind
and
this
ones
2
cheaper
highly
recommended
roast
but
balanced
no
hop
bitterness
overall
this
has
officially
become
my
favorite
dopplebock
a
must
try
if
you
love
dark
rich
malty
flavorful
beers
this
was
a
pleasant
economical
surprise
for
me
full
on
raisin
or
fig
notes
wa
stronger
than
expected
aroma
head
was
12
inch
wquick
dissapation
and
light
lacing
down
a
dt
snifter
as
it
warmed
the
malt
and
cream
flavors
increased
which
was
expected
yet
satisfying
i
would
have
zero
problem
buying
a
few
bombers
per
month
of
this
gem
btwn
now
and
spring
my
50th
review
woohoo
deep
dark
burgundy
with
a
smallish
head
dark
fruits
like
raisins
plums
etc
on
the
smell
similar
on
the
taste
sweet
but
not
over
the
top
with
some
caramel
very
pleasing
to
the
palate
mmm
this
is
a
most
tasty
brew
well
worth
a
buy
again
much
better
than
the
salvator
doppelbock
imo
taste
is
quite
similar
to
the
aroma
fairly
substantial
malty
treat
wheat
malts
are
present
but
are
not
the
primary
flavor
characteristic
instead
it
is
the
dark
fruits
and
molasses
that
were
evident
on
the
nose
stickiness
in
the
mouthfeel
sweet
but
not
cloying
still
drinks
quite
light
thanks
to
the
lager
yeast
no
alcohol
detection
what
so
ever
quite
high
on
my
list
of
doppelbocks
so
far
especially
for
the
extremely
low
price
tag
notes
very
nice
doppelbock
with
a
good
balance
with
dark
fruit
and
tartsour
flavors
along
with
a
nice
sweet
flavor
and
some
dark
bready
flavors
just
an
overall
nice
beer
to
drink
and
a
solid
example
of
the
style
d
this
is
an
amazing
highly
complex
doppelbock
from
weihenstephaner
bursting
with
flavor
and
character
on
several
levels
excellent
and
heartily
recommended
a
must
try
if
you
havent
already
this
is
the
best
dopplebock
ive
hadwhile
celebrator
is
definitely
more
complex
and
interesting
this
is
straight
foward
to
the
point
and
nails
the
style
perfectly
just
a
great
very
very
drinkable
brew
thats
enjoyable
sip
after
sip
500ml
bottle
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
pours
a
crisp
brown
with
a
nice
frothy
khaki
head
that
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
just
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
was
loads
of
caramel
with
slight
brown
malts
and
molasses
the
taste
is
an
interesting
blend
of
sweet
caramel
with
mild
fresh
ground
coffee
and
a
hint
of
dried
fruit
nice
and
complex
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
dryness
this
is
certainly
an
enjoyable
doppelbock
not
quite
the
best
ive
had
but
close
d
very
good
flavor
another
i
wish
came
in
liter
bottles
tmd
it
has
a
different
taste
that
has
a
little
bite
a
taste
of
bitterness
mixed
with
alcohol
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
somewhat
smooth
it
leaves
a
lingering
taste
on
your
palate
and
that
is
the
only
thing
i
dont
like
all
in
all
a
good
brew
i
would
try
another
served
overall
its
a
nice
brew
and
not
a
bad
introduction
to
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
what
a
great
beer
she
has
a
long
black
body
and
a
coffeeandcreamcolored
thick
head
smells
sweet
and
smoky
very
malty
has
a
sour
taste
while
sweet
at
the
same
time
smoke
is
present
in
the
taste
as
well
the
sweetness
is
of
malts
and
fruits
the
body
is
moderatemedium
with
low
carbonation
i
would
like
more
body
from
a
beer
like
this
but
its
very
good
that
being
my
only
complaint
drink
up
a
full
on
malt
bomb
with
lots
of
malt
depth
and
complexity
something
i
can
appreciate
and
you
know
when
it
comes
from
weihenstephan
it
is
going
to
be
supremely
crafted
i
think
i
would
still
take
celebrator
over
this
if
needing
to
fix
a
doppelbock
craving
which
i
admit
rarely
happens
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
mdthis
beer
is
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
a
very
good
dobbel
it
would
be
a
fantastic
winter
beer
d
quite
nice
except
for
the
thin
body
this
is
a
very
good
dopplebock
d
high
as
long
as
you
take
your
time
a
good
half
hour
plus
to
savor
this
pint
and
a
half
or
so
one
of
the
better
weihenstephaner
beers
ive
had
in
a
bottle
maybe
i
finally
got
a
fresh
one
who
knows
the
body
really
set
this
off
for
me
the
bottle
would
do
no
need
for
more
this
is
a
meal
on
its
own
out
of
a
bomber
bottle
this
beer
was
a
crystal
clear
garnet
color
with
one
finger
of
yellowtantinted
head
the
retention
was
good
especially
as
a
collar
and
the
lacing
soso
in
patches
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
malt
alcohol
heat
maple
syrup
brown
sugar
and
lotsa
malt
the
flavors
were
just
the
same
and
very
tasty
i
detected
lots
of
caramel
molasses
maple
sugar
brown
sugar
hints
of
honey
hints
of
coffee
alcohol
esters
and
a
long
roasty
finish
very
drinkable
for
7
4
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
mediumfull
and
the
carbonation
medium
which
was
good
for
the
style
in
general
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
thought
it
an
accurate
example
of
the
style
notes
i
had
this
during
starkbierfest
at
brauhaus
schmitz
this
caught
my
attention
because
i
read
the
brewery
is
almost
a
millenium
old
and
the
flavor
description
was
immense
glad
i
tried
it
i
love
this
beer
from
the
25
fl
oz
bottle
5269
sampled
on
july
17
2010
the
pour
gurgles
loudly
and
slowly
into
the
glass
and
becomes
a
dark
amber
color
with
ruby
red
hues
and
a
thin
but
long
lasting
beige
head
i
find
the
aroma
to
be
an
inviting
interfusion
of
roasted
malts
toffee
and
molasses
the
bold
mouthfeel
is
as
eloquent
as
the
way
it
sounded
pouring
into
the
glass
although
the
abv
is
over
7
the
alcohol
taste
is
well
buried
beneath
the
bitter
but
malty
sweetness
sensation
at
the
start
with
a
finale
of
light
hops
defintely
a
beer
to
have
again
this
is
one
more
great
offering
from
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
it
is
incredibly
smooth
nicely
textured
and
well
carbonated
i
have
had
a
number
of
overprimed
doppelbocks
this
one
really
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
it
is
light
and
sprity
even
though
the
pour
produces
that
beautiful
tall
cap
this
is
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
that
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
i
find
this
for
some
reason
hugely
refreshing
and
drinkable
i
could
sink
a
few
of
these
for
sure
though
the
abv
would
be
a
problem
another
good
beer
from
weihenstephaner
last
one
in
my
set
check
them
out
d
this
is
an
amazing
highly
complex
doppelbock
from
weihenstephaner
bursting
with
flavor
and
character
on
several
levels
excellent
and
heartily
recommended
a
must
try
if
you
havent
already
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
bittersweet
and
balanced
well
a
delicious
dopplebock
d
while
not
especially
complex
this
beer
is
just
sweet
enough
to
limit
me
to
one
at
a
time
it
falls
a
bit
short
of
celebrator
but
what
doesnt
its
in
the
upper
tier
of
doppelbocks
and
is
worth
a
try
d
i
havent
had
many
doppelbocks
but
i
can
imagine
that
this
excellent
beer
is
one
of
the
highlights
of
the
style
ridiculously
enjoyable
the
body
was
a
bit
stickier
than
i
prefer
for
this
style
but
still
very
enjoyable
drinkability
was
very
nice
i
would
certainly
have
this
beer
again
overall
a
very
nice
version
of
maybe
one
of
the
standards
of
this
style
o
a
subtle
yet
well
crafted
doppel
not
too
much
of
a
punch
in
the
mouth
like
other
doppels
simply
balanced
d
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
is
perfect
when
youre
also
looking
to
have
a
snack
because
it
will
definitely
satisfy
your
hunger
d
this
is
hilariously
drinkable
for
a
beer
this
strong
im
not
given
to
the
maltier
beers
but
this
ones
great
stuff
i
swear
does
this
brewery
have
the
biggest
ego
ever
theyre
like
we
can
make
amazing
beers
that
americans
would
spend
lots
of
money
for
but
well
make
them
for
2
99
i
love
weihenstephaner
they

this

and

a
nice
head
to
it
the
appearance
is
amazing
with
a
scent
that
overflows
with

this
beer
remains
to
be

this
is

pours
a

fades

to
a
ring

some
lace
deep
brown
color
with
some

bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
m
d
sweet
malt
is
integrated
into
a
toasty
somewhat
creamy
presentation
d
very
drinkable
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
a
wide
array
of
foods
d
quite
simple
overall
but
good
i
imagine
this
pair
well
with
roasted
duck
or
sausage
a
bit
too
mild
and
one
dimensional
to
be
a
go
to
beer
for
me
i
love
dark
beers
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
that
ive
tasted
first
off
the
color
is
a
beautiful
mahagony
and
the
head
is
a
nice
beige
what
makes
the
beer
pop
is
the
hint
of
nuttiness
in
every
sip
it
goes
well
with
german
sausages
or
hamburgers
its
highly
drinkable
but
would
benefit
from
distanced
drinkings
if
you
like
newcastle
you
will
love
this
beer
not
bad
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
to
have
much
at
once
md
mouthfeel
is
about
perfect
fills
the
mouth
but
doesnt
cloy
this
is
very
drinkable
and
will
certainly
leave
you
with
a
buzz
after
the
whole
pint
pours
a
dark
brown
with
about
an
inch
of
thick
head
the
head
forms
heavy
lacing
around
the
side
of
the
glass
after
only
sitting
for
a
minute
the
aroma
is
fantastic
im
reminded
of
choclate
dark
fruits
and
slightly
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
everything
id
hoped
for
huge
malty
flavor
dominates
everything
the
aftertaste
stays
in
my
mouth
a
little
bit
longer
than
id
like
all
in
all
a
great
value
still
glad
i
tried
this
d
talk
about
a
porkchop
in
a
bottle
thickness
and
mouth
coating
make
it
a
little
less
drinkable
than
it
could
be
but
overall
this
is
a
truly
great
beer
sip
it
and
savor
it
because
you
probably
wont
feel
like
having
a
second
one
impressions
quite
good
i
was
a
bit
surprised
to
get
a
nose
full
of
treacle
from
this
one
but
it
tasted
quite
lovely
and
shows
that
not
all
doppelbocks
have
to
be
exactly
the
same
this
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorites
pours
a
nice
brown
cola
color
with
large
bubbles
and
a
khaki
head
the
nose
is
smoky
and
rich
with
notes
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
molasses
the
palate
is
loaded
with
flavors
of
root
spice
and
dark
malt
sweetness
with
notes
of
bread
nuts
and
coffee
tasty
would
definitely
get
this
again
taste
ive
honestly
never
tasted
anything
like
this
almost
like
a
root
beer
version
of
a
bock
root
spices
along
with
dark
malt
sweetness
bready
sweet
just
amazing
a
nice
white
pepper
spice
at
the
end
i
must
admit
im
a
abit
overwhelmed
by
this
one
it
has
now
been
added
to
my
top
5
favorite
beers
somehow
i
imagine
this
as
the
german
equivalent
to
our
malt
liquors
something
thats
made
to
casually
chug
after
a
hard
day
ill
keep
it
in
mind
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
these
although
its
very
nice
its
not
as
heavy
going
down
as
much
as
the
way
it
sits
inside
you
d
this
is
very
drinkable
for
its
abv
and
doesnt
come
across
as
strong
at
all
this
seems
like
it
would
be
a
good
winter
beer
to
have
around
a
fireplace
drinkability
quite
tasty
and
drinkable
though
too
high
in
alcohol
to
be
a
real
session
beer
ill
call
it
good
drinkability
perfect
with
a
meal
but
also
nice
for
drinking
by
itself
this
beer
got
me
started
on
trying
new
styles
many
years
ago
and
now
that
my
tastebuds
have
grown
i
appreciate
the
beer
more
but
i
miss
some
of
those
initial
wow
flavors
i
seem
to
remember
long
ago
finished
off
the
glass
pretty
fast
and
despite
the
higher
abv
i
wish
i
had
another
500
ml
or
at
least
another
250
ml
d
this
one
was
ok
but
it
didnt
really
wow
me
solid
drinkable
big
beer
just
enough
abv
that
it
will
get
you
if
you
try
to
drink
it
constantly
over
an
afternoon
excellent
for
after
dinner
relaxation
not
after
thanksgiving
dinner
but
a
evenings
pleasant
meal
cheers
weihenstephaner
easy
to
drink
probably
not
as
fresh
as
i
would
like
would
definitely
be
interested
in
trying
fresh
on
tap
for
maybe
more
of
a
pricklycarbonated
mouthfeel
mouthfeel
is
medium
full
and
has
a
luscious
smoothness
to
it
d
a
monster
beer
hides
its
abv
unbelievably
well
a
beautiful
texture
the
first
mouthful
if
you
love
malt
sends
you
to
heaven
with
its
smooth
transition
from
sweet
malts
to
a
delicate
toasted
malt
note
balancing
with
a
milk
chocolate
creaminess
and
the
dark
chocolate
bitterness
coming
through
in
the
finish
all
this
while
maintaining
a
full
body
and
a
clean
lager
finish
best
doppelbock
ever
this
is
the
gold
standard
d
as
close
to
the
classic
examples
of
the
style
as
you
get
this
is
not
a
session
beer
but
stands
out
as
a
great
lenten
drink
d
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
notes
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
big
beer
just
look
out
for
the
solid
7
4
abv
that
will
sneak
up
on
you
weihenstephaner
korbinian
is
another
world
class
beer
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
this
just
became
my
favorite
doppelbock
sorry
spaten
d
all
night
long
the
drinkability
is
only
diminished
by
the
alcohol
content
of
this
beer
i
could
easily
drink
2
or
3
bottles
of
this
in
a
sitting
if
i
wasnt
such
a
lightweight
thick
and
syrupy
body
with
little
carbonation
give
this
beer
a
very
viscous
mouthfeel
nice
and
pleasantly
chewy
the
korbinian
is
a
deliciously
drinkable
beer
d
im
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
dopplebocks
but
this
was
quite
drinkable
and
tasty
d
dangerous
complex
and
tasty
without
the
overpowering
and
offputting
burntmalt
and
overripefruit
flavors
of
some
lesser
dopplebocks
despite
the
age
on
this
particular
bottle
its
kept
its
flavors
remarkably
i
had
a
fresh
bottle
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
the
differences
were
negligable
ive
had
this
a
dozen
or
so
times
and
its
been
consistently
exceptional
korbinian
easily
ranks
as
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
overall
try
it
with
beef
stew
or
baked
beans
with
blackforest
bacon
which
im
eating
right
now
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
malts
caramel
and
dark
fruits
taste
is
very
mild
compared
to
the
smell
some
malts
caramel
and
alcohol
is
present
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quality
beer
another
winner
from
the
crew
at
weihenstephaner
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
sure
i
would
want
another
flavor
is
a
little
too
mild
for
my
taste
d
its
7
4
and
the
alcohol
is
imperceptible
goes
down
easily
and
the
smell
keeps
me
interested
too
i
could
definitely
have
two
bottles
of
this
which
would
be
a
litre
and
6
standard
drinks
au
delicious
and
a
great
value
highly
recommend
drinkability
another
clean
and
true
to
the
style
beer
from
this
brewery
i
could
have
several
of
these
very
enjoyable
a
fresh
beguiling
nose
of
spicy
cinnamon
clove
toasty
malt
cocoa
figs
and
raisins
the
mouthfeel
really
elevates
this
brew
with
dark
malty
raisin
and
chocolate
flavors
there
is
a
light
tangy
tartness
and
the
warm
cinnamon
and
clove
spiciness
as
well
as
a
bit
of
zing
from
teh
alcohol
a
masterfully
refreshing
balance
in
a
dark
wintry
style
of
beer
magnificent
incredibly
drinkable
and
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
extremely
sticky
carbonation
is
low
but
pretty
active
and
yes
mr
oliver
it
went
great
with
my
pork
chop
and
especially
the
roasted
carrots
and
onions
it
was
a
good
brew
but
not
a
great
brew
from
this
company
this
is
the
worst
brew
i
have
had
from
brauerei
weihenstephan
but
it
is
still
better
than
most
beers
drinkability
is
good
for
over
7
percent
its
almost
sessionable
its
just
a
little
on
the
bland
side
it
might
be
old
since
it
traveled
a
long
way
to
get
to
me
and
theres
no
dating
on
the
bottle
worth
the
price
since
its
rather
cheap
but
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
the
korbinian
doppelbock
pours
a
deep
amber
almost
copper
color
with
a
very
pillowy
hazy
white
head
and
lots
of
sticky
lacing
aromas
is
malty
caramel
and
subtle
hints
of
chocolate
quaff
is
extremely
malty
background
tastes
include
raisins
caramel
and
a
dry
hoppy
finish
i
really
enjoy
the
sweetness
to
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
carbonation
is
great
drinkability
is
good
for
this
beer
the
sweetness
makes
it
in
my
opinion
and
with
a
nice
7
4
abv
it
is
easy
to
handle
d
goes
down
very
smooth
sweet
buy
not
cloying
a
wonderful
german
winter
warmer
poured
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
nice
tan
head
nose
is
mostly
chocolate
and
molasses
taste
is
sweet
dark
caramely
malts
lead
to
a
dry
finish
with
minimal
hop
bitterness
and
no
roasty
bitterness
noted
some
good
chocolate
and
maloasses
notes
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
and
viscous
almost
fullbodied
i
think
einhorn
has
this
one
beat
but
its
good
dinteresting
that
the
american
import
bottle
is
marked
malt
liquor
not
at
all
boozy
despite
the
abv
nice
front
flavors
and
smells
but
somewhat
coarse
tasting
in
the
finish
that
said
i
would
drink
this
again
but
by
no
means
is
it
a
standard
d
somewhere
between
a
sipper
and
a
session
beer
it
doesnt
quite
reach
the
level
of
complexity
of
a
sipper
but
it
a
bit
heavy
to
session
therefore
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
but
i
would
enjoy
that
one
this
probably
goes
good
with
a
hearty
meal
of
meat
and
potatoes
and
im
sure
the
germans
pair
it
with
such
hearty
meals
frequently
a
tasty
doppelbock
overall
d
always
a
great
choice
drinkability
a
very
solid
dopple
i
liked
celebrator
better
but
this
was
a
nice
dopple
too
korbinian
is
an
example
of
a
great
doppelbock
this
one
is
up
there
with
ayingers
celebrator
the
7
4
abv
is
hardly
noticable
with
the
great
balance
of
the
beer
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
i
reckon
i
could
give
it
a
good
crack
lighter
in
body
than
expectded
considering
the
array
of
rich
malty
flavors
and
aromas
delicious
and
rediculously
drinkable
never
too
sweet
or
alcoholic
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
not
my
favorite
dopplebock
but
delicious
when
fresh
and
on
tap
o
dark
daring
and
delicious
while
the
darkness
alcohol
and
full
flavor
of
this
beer
may
overwhelm
those
that
only
drink
lighter
lagers
those
that
can
appreciate
the
qualities
of
this
beer
will
fall
in
love
with
it
i
look
forward
to
trying
both
more
weihenstephan
brews
as
well
as
other
beers
brewed
in
the
doppelbock
style
i
am
happy
to
give
my
first
a
rating
on
beer
advocate
to
this
beer
thanks
weihenstephaner
i
will
buy
you
again
d
on
a
different
planet
than
other
examples
of
a
style
that
never
got
me
too
excited
to
have
a
doppelbock
better
than
this
would
simply
blow
my
mind
im
not
ruling
it
out
and
im
sure
there
may
be
one
out
there
but
as
of
now
im
oblivious
to
it
theres
a
little
too
much
mineral
in
the
nose
but
the
taste
is
so
invitingly
complex
and
the
feel
is
so
damn
soft
and
smooth
that
the
korbinian
kicks
the
drinkability
out
of
all
others
all
hail
the
pack
bear
i
have
generally
been
fairly
indifferent
about
doppelbocks
but
this
one
just
nails
the
style
and
i
love
it
this
is
just
a
fantastic
beer
and
its
high
drinkability
is
surprising
very
creamy
and
drinkable
well
put
together
d
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
i
have
had
it
reminded
me
of
ayingers
celebrator
overall
an
excellent
beer
i
will
be
buying
much
more
of
pours
a
dark
garnet
red
with
a
huge
aroma
of
dried
cherries
and
burnt
raisins
a
real
fruitcake
aroma
the
taste
is
the
same
great
dried
cherries
and
figs
a
great
balance
of
flavor
along
with
the
subtle
warmth
of
the
alchohol
an
easy
drinker
but
one
to
savor
for
its
taste
as
well
as
the
7
4
abv
another
great
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
good
stuff
recommended
pours
a
beautifully
clear
darkest
shade
of
black
cherry
with
a
huge
creamyfrothy
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
cap
but
leaves
incredible
lacing
all
the
way
down
smells
of
caramel
brown
bread
figs
prunes
dark
fruit
lots
of
sweet
malty
aromas
ticket
the
nose
taste
is
sweet
with
malts
dark
fruits
prunes
figs
burnt
brown
sugar
a
touch
of
alcohol
about
midway
and
a
long
lingering
molasses
and
dark
fruit
finish
sweet
sticky
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
carbonation
thick
body
this
is
a
great
dopplebock
a
malt
heads
dream
with
great
complexity
and
an
abv
that
is
well
hidden
d
i
was
surprised
how
good
it
was
its
sweet
but
not
cloying
respectable
abv
is
not
apparent
at
all
drinkability
a
bit
darker
lesser
alcoholic
and
fruity
than
many
doppelbocks
out
there
i
dug
it
i
mean
theres
only
so
much
alcohol
and
fruit
a
man
really
needs
right
an
absolute
repeat
buy
this
is
a
very
good
beerone
which
would
be
thoroughly
satisfying
and
not
at
all
overwhelming
aroma
is
rich
and
malty
with
a
sweet
but
not
cloying
undertone
rather
like
cinnamon
rolls
it
pours
a
very
appetizing
semitranslucent
mahogany
with
a
fairly
thick
and
somewhat
persistent
pale
tan
head
aroma
is
malty
with
just
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
spice
mainly
cinnamon
plus
just
a
touch
of
fruit
texture
is
tingly
fizzy
and
lively
downright
lipsmacking
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
and
watery
but
that
just
adds
to
the
drinkability
has
a
nice
sweet
maltiness
and
some
nice
carbonation
that
gives
it
a
pretty
smooth
and
slightly
dry
finish
you
can
get
a
hint
of
the
booze
but
for
a
soppelbock
thats
a
bit
expected
this
is
an
awesome
beer
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
two
finger
creamy
eggshell
colored
head
smell
muted
dark
brown
sugar
molasses
musty
grain
taste
dark
brown
sugar
edging
towards
chocolate
hint
of
peppery
alcohol
a
little
spicy
hops
and
sourish
yeast
characteristic
mouthfeel
smooth
creamy
very
drinkable
with
hidden
alcohol
exposed
as
a
growing
warmth
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
d
not
too
bad
a
great
example
of
a
doppelbock
worth
trying
for
anyone
who
loves
maltbombs
the
consistency
and
carbonation
are
reminiscent
of
the
balance
of
the
best
belgians
in
their
ability
to
disguise
their
powerful
abv
however
the
finish
is
smoky
but
a
bit
watered
down
before
i
knew
it
my
mug
was
empty
d
a
true
sipper
this
took
me
a
looong
time
to
drink
this
is
a
true
big
beer
i
had
a
really
hard
time
finishing
the
whole
pint
because
the
heavy
dark
malts
and
the
sweet
cherries
would
have
preferred
to
split
this
with
someone
for
dessert
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
light
in
body
and
medlight
carbonation
just
right
doesnt
hinder
the
more
subtle
flavors
pours
a
very
dark
brown

that

weihenstephaner
makes
consistently
great
beers
and
korbinian
is
no
exception
very
drinkable
t
mmmm
smooth
lightly
creamy
with
touch
of
fruitiness
that
drifts
along
the
top
of
your
palate
unique
for
being
such
a
dark
appearing
brew
tinge
of
sourness
towards
the
background
and
finishing
faint
sweet
coffee
in
equal
intensity
to
other
profiles
that
just
creates
and
balanced
complex
delicious
experience
to
the
ones
like
me
that
are
not
big
fans
of
german
beers
and
that
think
that
the
rauschbeers
are
the
only
ones
that
could
be
taken
seriously
its
a
quite
funny
experience
drinking
a
good
and
old
weihenstephaner
this
has
a
redbrown
crystal
color
and
a
well
defined
and
mature
taste
in
the
end
the
lesson
is
quite
simple
dont
underestimate
the
germans
they
can
do
of
course
excellent
beers
like
this
one
overall
a
real
good
beer
period
i
really
enjoy
this
style
and
would
be
glad
to
pick
this
up
again
d
real
good
drinker
this
is
probably
the
best
doppelbock
ive
ever
had
drinkability
this
one
is
made
for
sipping
and
relaxing
quite
nice
to
drink
and
id
be
happy
to
have
another
i
certainly
will
seek
this
one
out
whenever
given
a
chance
another
great
weihenstephaner
beer
and
a
great
example
of
the
doppelbock
style
i
wish
i
had
more
not
in
my
opinion
what
i
would
consider
a
staunchly
traditional
bock
but
one
of
my
favorites
to
date
so
drinkable
and
smooth
loads
of
flavor
without
overdoing
one
aspect
over
another
a
delight
d
a
good
beer
that
would
have
been
much
better
without
the
soy
sauce
flavor
very
great
flavor
bit
thick
and
hard
to
swallow
but
overall
a
fantastic
brew
this
beer
is
incredibly
smooth
mouthfeel
is
good
full
bodied
and
the
drinkability
is
high
overall
a
decent
brew
with
great
tastelayers
recommendable
interesting
little
beer
this
one
ruby
tinges
on
the
dark
body
and
a
solid
milky
head
some
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
but
a
strong
whiff
of
almost
winelike
plums
or
raisins
but
kind
of
musty
like
an
oxidised
wine
although
this
is
definitely
not
oxidised
those
pruney
flavours
come
through
on
the
palate
too
loud
and
clear
a
beer
for
certain
occasions
maybe
but
i
dig
it
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
that
are
around
the
label
is
really
cool
looking
too
hmm
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
my
thing
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
bit
it
just
doesnt
make
it
happen
for
me
a
heavy
malt
oriented
beer
can
go
in
a
few
directions
chocolatecoffee
or
dark
fruit
and
probably
a
few
other
directions
i
find
the
choccoffee
much
more
appealing
overall
i
was
a
fan
of
this
beer
despite
the
style
not
being
my
favorite
flavors
are
all
present
in
abundance
and
this
is
well
worth
checking
out
a
quality
doppelbock
from
weihenstephaner
and
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
a
must
try
drinkability
is
great
i
could
have
easily
finished
the
entire
bottle
on
my
own
and
then
some
overall
yet
another
gem
from
those
crafty
germans
at
weihenstephaner
another
great
product
by
the
weihenstephaner
brewery
excellent
dopplebock
product
to
take
note
of
this
one
pours
a
nice
chocolate
brown
with
ruby
highlights
about
an
inch
of
tan
head
and
decent
lacing
nice
stuff
here
it
smells
like
a
malt
bomb
with
big
chocolate
caramel
and
toasted
bread
notes
some
raisin
and
dark
fruit
comes
through
too
taste
is
delicious
like
a
german
brown
ale
this
is
tremendous
much
better
than
troegenator
which
might
be
the
only
other
doppelbock
ive
had
good
blend
of
dark
fruit
with
the
toasted
bready
malt
that
remains
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
too
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
though
coating
drinkability
is
greatnice
tasting
beer
with
a
mediumlight
body
that
keeps
me
slugging
it
down
good
stuff
from
weihenstephaner
although
i
still
prefer
vitus
and
heffe
d
i
would
have
this
again
but
when
there
was
some
snow
on
the
ground
these
beers
continue
to
impress
me
i
have
been
pretty
much
experimenting
with
strictly
american
breweries
but
these
keep
me
wondering
about
other
german
beers
only
one
way
to
find
out
cheers
its
a
good
bavarian
doppelbock
on
the
level
of
say
a
maximator
not
bad
not
good
not
average
just
slightly
above
in
a
highly
competitive
and
well
done
style
nice
price
on
it
htough
as
with
all
weihenstephaner
products
they
are
priced
right
good
rich
body
but
needs
more
carbonation
to
dry
out
the
finish
a
bit
notes
simply
a
classic
dopplebock
one
heck
of
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
one
that
rivals
a
sentimental
favorite
spaten
optimator
despite
the
greatness
of
other
weihenstephaner
beers
this
is
likely
my
favorite
drinkability
very
drinkable
this
would
be
wise
to
consume
at
home
if
you
want
more
than
one
very
good
beer
but
not
as
complex
as
others
in
this
style
medium
bodied
it
has
a
nearly
clean
malty
flavor
but
again
some
fruitiness
mostly
in
the
form
of
prunes
come
through
now
and
again
hoppiness
is
barely
noticeable
yet
it
is
not
overly
sweet
or
cloying
rich
flavor
in
a
thin
bodywell
not
that
thin
but
certainly
less
than
most
bocks
not
to
mention
doppels
very
complexquite
dry
for
the
style
a
touch
of
sugar
on
the
tongue
only
on
the
initial
sip
surprisingly
hoppy
in
the
swallow
which
lingers
throughout
the
aftertaste
some
chocolate
notes
without
any
burnt
flavors
at
all
almost
like
ice
cream
first
time
trying
weihenstephaner
doppelbock
and
i
very
much
enjoyed
it
and
ill
be
enjoying
this
beer
again
and
again
drinkability
is
pretty
high
ill
definitely
be
looking
into
the
occasional
bottle
during
the
upcoming
fall
and
winter
months
good
drinkability
but
a
little
strong
to
have
more
than
one
dont
want
that
alcohol
burning
a
hole
in
my
gut
damn
good
though
and
will
have
it
again
nice
take
on
the
style
and
quite
drinkable
another
winner
from
this
brewery
d
great
dopplebock
of
course
im
not
surprised
that
weihenstephaner
did
a
great
job
on
a
beer
aaaargh
the
agony
of
admitting
that
such
a
greatlooking
greatsmelling
beer
from
these
master
german
brewers
could
be
a
letdown
on
taste
its
a
lovely
brew
it
just
tastes
and
feels
thin
and
the
nose
promised
so
much
more
i
dont
want
to
denigrate
this
great
brew
any
further
so
ill
finish
by
pointing
out
that
it
is
extremely
drinkable
s
its
carbonated
loosely
creamy
texture
theres
a
nice
light
tingle
that
dissolves
away
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
drinkability
this
beer
goes
fast
and
makes
you
wish
you
had
bought
another
bottle
overall
an
excellent
brew
through
and
through
im
generally
a
big
fan
of
big
malty
beers
like
dopplebocks
and
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
not
my
absolute
favorite
dopplebock
but
certainly
in
my
top
5
overall
ill
confess
that
doppelbocks
are
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
this
was
a
strong
representation
nonetheless
and
would
come
recommended
if
this
is
the
style
of
beer
that
does
it
for
you
this
poured
a
clear
dark
mahogany
with
tan
head
it
smelled
like
honey
wheat
bread
and
smoky
barley
with
molasses
and
roasted
coffee
it
tasted
like
smoked
barley
and
roasted
coffee
and
molasses
and
honey
wheat
bread
with
bitter
chocolate
and
nutty
malt
it
was
watery
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
malty
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
clean
and
tasty
beer
with
a
great
roasted
and
smokey
flavor
it
had
good
body
and
hid
the
alcohol
very
well
so
it
was
super
easy
to
drink
maybe
not
the
most
complex
or
delicious
doppelbock
ive
ever
had
but
i
definitely
fully
enjoyed
it
another
hit
from
weihenstephan
d
very
easy
to
drink
its
you
like
this
style
and
i
do
one
of
my
favorite
i
think
its
time
to
open
another
one
cheers
pleasant
but
still
not
quite
my
favorite
of
the
style
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
though
and
i
would
never
dream
of
overlooking
this
one
edit
1224
fresh
flavor
is
doughy
with
hazelnuts
creamy
gentle
with
the
caramel
just
a
twinge
of
bitter
earth
carbonation
is
just
a
hair
better
then
last
time
but
it
whips
the
beer
in
a
constant
froth
love
it
d
i
could
drink
this
like
water
the
flavours
really
seem
to
agree
with
me
this
has
been
one
of
my
favourite
beersdoppelbocks
for
a
long
time
im
glad
i
finally
reviewed
it
in
my
opinion
its
weihenstephaners
best
beer
d
very
easy
to
drink
made
me
wish
i
had
picked
up
more
than
one
over
all
not
my
favorite
doppelbock
but
in
my
top
5
overall
a
great
drinker
a
bit
on
the
dry
side
compared
to
some
others
within
the
style
but
that
is
a
good
thing
good
balance
makes
you
keep
reaching
for
the
glass
glad
i
tried
it
def
a
great
beer
with
a
high
abv
that
is
great
for
sipping
and
relaxing
had
this
at
the
gingerman
in
houston
pours
a
black
color
with
hints
of
red
in
it
coffee
color
head
about
half
inch
which
slowly
receded
aromas
of
cocoa
powder
caramel
chocolate
and
figs
a
very
good
smelling
beer
this
is
one
amazing
tasting
beer
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
more
of
the
same
flavors
one
time
cocoa
powder
dominated
and
next
sip
mostly
figs
and
the
next
just
chocolate
wow
i
love
this
beer
the
alcohol
is
hidden
quite
well
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
a
delight
now
this
had
become
my
favorite
dopplebock
kicking
the
celebrator
from
the
top
spot
for
dopplebocks
d
not
a
hint
of
alcohol
to
be
tasted
at
all
and
the
flavor
is
absolutely
perfect
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
probably
the
best
dopplebock
ive
had
note
to
self
do
a
sidebyside
with
this
one
and
celebrator
rad
beer
liked
it
a
looot
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
one
and
one
half
inch
head
of
a
pale
tan
color
great
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
slight
pale
malt
sweet
malt
slight
hop
and
yeast
fits
the
style
of
a
doppelbock
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
sweet
malt
then
yeast
pale
malt
hint
of
hop
slight
bread
dough
and
slight
alcohol
overall
good
aroma
feel
body
and
blend
again
this
is
the
tastiest
doppelbock
ive
ever
had
and
picked
up
four
bottles
for
home
from
the
brewery
to
hopefully
share
with
my
buds
the
first
time
i
cracked
a
bottle
i
emptied
the
contents
into
a
stemless
wine
glass
thinking
the
large
opening
of
the
vessel
will
enable
me
to
get
a
better
smell
and
possibly
catch
the
more
subtle
undertones
it
worked
and
i
truly
love
the
color
to
me
it
is
a
plum
brown
color
with
a
hint
of
prune
and
a
nice
layering
that
does
not
come
off
as
sharp
in
taste
nice
and
rounded
the
head
was
a
light
tan
about
a
knuckle
in
height
that
did
dissipate
after
a
few
minutes
this
beer
is
great
with
pecan
pie
or
any
other
heavy
rich
dessert
enjoy
yall
definitely
low
on
the
sweetness
scale
for
a
doppel
and
the
malts
have
a
nearly
burnt
caramel
flavor
there
is
a
bit
of
toastiness
in
there
that
is
contributing
as
much
if
not
more
bitterness
as
the
hops
its
a
pretty
unique
doppelbock
and
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
but
i
like
some
of
weihenstephaners
other
offerings
better

quite
good
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
daresay
it
rivals
the
standard
doppelbock
paulaner
salvator
although
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
than
expected
it
does
taste
good
and
it
certainly
worth
a
try

just
my
style
thanks
for
the
spot
on
suggestion
sprinkle
a
great
refreshing
malty
beer
poured
from
the
dark
brown
bottle
with
the
bishop
and
the
beautiful
bavarian
flag
the
result
was
a
big
frothy
head
this
doppelbock
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
fills
the
mouth
with
many
flavors
dense
bread
molasses
and
heavy
malt
more
flavors
make
their
presence
known
as
the
brew
warms
to
room
temp
such
as
raisin
or
dates
with
a
stronger
hint
of
alcohol
but
even
then
the
7
2
is
buried
the
epitome
of
a
dunkel
this
is
what
many
american
craft
brewers
try
to
emulate
second
only
to
the
worlds
best
dunkel
ayingers
celebrator
doppelbock
but
only
the
thread
of
a
bishops
hat
d
easy
to
drink
for
a
darker
and
stronger
beer
not
exactly
my
style
but
i
enjoyed
it
edit
had
this
one
again
from
the
weihenstephan
christmas
pack
121609
i
poured
it
into
my
kickass
weihenstephan
glass
and
it
poured
a
huge
massively
thick
and
compact
brown
head
that
never
faded
and
left
curtains
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
i
also
got
smoky
toffee
flavor
that
stayed
on
my
palate
even
after
the
finish
my
score
has
been
altered
to
average
my
first
appearance
score
and
the
new
one
drinkability
a
delicious
beer
that
i
enjoyed
a
bit
too
bitter
with
a
strong
after
taste
that
faded
quickly
this
is
an
interesting
example
of
the
dopplebock
style
incorporating
some
of
those
dark
fruit
flavors
found
in
strong
dark
belgian
ales
that
i
really
dig
very
drinkable
medium
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
pours

dark

brown
nice
and

smells
like

bit

thickness
heartiness
of
it
is
almost
like
liquified
bread
pudding
lots
of
sweet
malt
lots
of
dark
plum
flavours
hints
at
roastiness
and
chocolate
something
like
a
sweet
toffee
or
molasses
alcoholic
on
the
back
palate
but
it
fades
a
bit
medicinal
but
nothing
overbearing
like
fresh
baked
bread
very
creamy
mouthfeel
though
very
pleasurable
the
alcohol
serves
to
warm
and
doesnt
detract
from
the
experience
a
great
beer
weihenstephaner
continues
to
come
through
overall
a
great
doppelbock
the
smooth
and
fruity
character
are
a
welcome
change
from
my
usual
hop
bombs
d
this
was
a
great
beer
and
made
me
love
weihenstephaner
as
a
brewery
even
more
very
drinkable
despite
the
abv
and
fullness
of
the
beer
delicious
might
be
my
favorite
doppel
between
this
and
celebrator
id
be
hard
pressed
to
choose
another
great
beer
from
weihenstephaner
i
prefered
this
over
the
celebrator
doppelbock
all
in
all
a
very
fine
sipping
beer
that
makes
me
realize
i
should
perhaps
spend
a
bit
more
time
in
the
import
section
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
must
for
any
dark
beer
fan
if
you
love
beer
like
kasteel
brune
then
i
recommend
this
if
you
drink
this
beer
let
it
sit
for
1015
minutes
before
you
even
pour
it
give
it
a
vigorous
pour
and
enjoy
anyone
who
likes
chocolate
will
love
this
one
even
people
who
normally
dont
drink
beer
because
its
really
solid
d
overall
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
ringing
in
with
7
4
alcohol
and
being
fairly
sweet
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
but
those
two
are
definitely
enjoyable
this
is
one
complex
and
tasty
beer
that
i
will
have
to
try
again
sometime
when
my
nose
is
a
little
less
plugged
up
this
is
one
great
beer
its
rich
complex
and
yet
somehow
manages
to
stay
very
drinkable
pours
dark
brown
with
a
twofinger
tan
head
that
waits
until
the
last
minute
to
take
off
amongst
a
rush
of
carbonation
activity
retention
isnt
bad
and
a
few
small
dots
of
lace
are
left
behind
aroma
is
thick
with
dark
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
lurking
in
the
shadows
are
some
hops
and
dark
fruits
figs
and
prunes
tastes
of
roasted
malts
with
an
alcohol
bite
following
shortly
thereafter
more
subtle
bitterness
follows
goes
down
a
little
sticky
with
the
alcohol
heat
hitting
the
back
of
the
throat
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
always
a
fan
of
a
good
doppelbock
and
this
one
didnt
dissapoint
taste
was
very
complex
overwhelming
sweetness
at
first
sip
gradually
gives
way
to
more
subtle
flavors
of
carmel
nutmeg
and
other
things
i
cant
identify
wonderful
weihenstephaner
did
it
again
this
is
a
great
beer
maybe
the
best
dopplebock
i
have
ever
had
d
very
drinkable
heafty
for
sure
but
also
drinkable
i
would
love
this
with
a
hot
sausage
or
a
piece
of
warm
whole
wheat
bread
smeared
with
fig
preserves
wow
good
beer
very
clean
pour
with
no
sediment
whatsoever
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
a
great
doppelbock
grabbed
this
one
on
someones
recommendation
and
i
was
glad
i
did
pours
a
mahoghany
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
has
great
retention
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
dark
fruit
taste
is
a
little
roasted
initially
giving
away
to
some
burnt
sugar
like
sweetness
a
touch
of
fruit
is
in
the
background
finish
is
a
bit
dry
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
is
isnt
cloyingly
sweet
as
some
doppelbocks
can
be
helping
its
drinkability
nothing
spectacular
here
but
quite
solid
the
taste
is
flavourful
yet
smooth
and
very
pleasant
with
prunes
woody
raisins
whole
wheat
toast
a
little
spice
it
has
solid
sweetness
with
a
toasty
pepperyspicey
bitterness
to
balance
it
and
which
takes
over
at
the
finish
weihenstephaner
has
another
winner
here
i
questioned
whether
they
could
truly
succeed
to
the
same
degree
without
any
banana
or
clove
boy
i
was
wrong
to
even
question
that
korbinian
could
use
a
stronger
nose
but
its
still
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
out
there
if
you
havent
tried
this
one
by
now
you
should
go
find
a
bottle
immediately
an
excellent
brew
overall
though
i
would
and
have
bought
this
again
another
fine
beer
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
a
very
nice
doppelbock
pretty
solid
flavors
throughout
but
nothing
special
great
deal
for
the
price
after
pouring
from
the
bottle
it
had
a
darker
wheat
color
of
foam
the
smell
was
strong
and
complex
and
had
a
nutty
hint
and
a
little
fruity
the
color
was
of
a
nice
porter
and
cola
look
its
taste
is
one
to
be
desired
rich
and
smooth
with
a
crisp
and
smokey
flavor
being
a
fan
of
german
beer
it
wasnt
hard
to
know
after
pouring
it
that
i
would
love
it
weihenstephan
holy
stephen
claims
to
be
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
i
cant
be
sure
of
that
but
i
do
know
that
dopplebocks
developed
near
the
brewerys
location
around
munich
around
the
middle
ages
if
this
brewery
really
is
the
worlds
eldest
than
good
on
them
for
continuing
the
production
of
the
monastic
liquid
bread
that
sustained
monks
during
their
periods
of
fasting
no
food
but
plenty
of
bock
beer
seems
almost
a
fair
trade
i
regret
not
having
tried
lager
styles
sooner
this
beer
was
phenomenal
and
has
certainly
paved
the
way
for
other
beers
of
this
style
d
while
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
would
say
i
could
down
more
than
one
bomber
in
a
sitting
truly
a
gourmet
meal
in
a
bottle
thank
you
bavaria
poured
to
a
nice
brown
color
that
seemed
to
have
some
burgundy
highlights
a
good
sized
tan
head
that
had
quite
good
retention
which
left
some
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
of
this
one
is
very
nice
as
bread
and
caramel
come
to
mind
also
though
it
has
been
imported
it
does
smells
fresh
and
i
think
that
comes
from
a
slight
fruit
aroma
that
is
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
very
good
malt
is
very
dominant
and
has
a
welcoming
flavor
caramel
and
toffee
come
to
mind
with
a
backing
of
raisin
or
prune
the
flavor
does
come
out
more
as
this
brew
sits
and
i
sip
it
though
the
alcohol
does
not
seen
to
be
noticeable
to
me
or
goes
so
well
with
the
other
flavors
it
is
hidden
overall
this
is
an
excellent
brew
one
i
would
get
again
and
hope
to
have
on
draft
at
some
point
give
this
brew
a
try
as
it
exemplifies
the
style
a
lot
going
on
but
can
get
to
be
a
bit
much
really
complex
but
can
be
sickly
sweet
if
you
had
a
handful
of
nuts
or
a
nice
bit
of
jarlsberg
itd
probably
balance
out
great
i
drank
this
one
with
a
fistful
of
supermarket
cheddar
on
the
side
since
there
wasnt
anything
better
in
the
fridge
and
still
had
a
good
time
excellent
beer
but
you
might
want
to
hold
off
til
christmas
would
be
dynamite
with
pudding
p
s
they
get
an
instant
5
0
on
appearance
practically
on
their
label
alone
what
other
beer
features
a
packbear
dangerously
drinkable
but
im
still
hungry
d
a
very
nice
doppel
not
up
there
with
my
favorite
example
of
this
style
but
excellent
nonetheless
im
glad
i
picked
this
up
have
revisited
this
great
cocoachocolate
flavors
rich
dark
malt
and
yet
not
cloying
dangerously
drinkable
and
top
notch
nose
is
a
bit
muted
but
very
flavorful
and
rich
pours
a
rubybrownish
body
big
creamy
offtan
head
lasting
malty
caramel
roasted
aromas
some
dark
fruit
plum
or
so
caramel
roasted
flavors
a
little
coffee
a
little
semisweet
chocolate
a
tiny
bit
of
nuttiness
very
good
highly
drinkable
beer
only
downfall
for
the
style
would
be
the
sweetness
it
may
push
some
people
away
if
they
are
looking
for
a
strong
dark
chocolatier
beer
this
is
a
fascinating
and
beguiling
beer
cheers
if
you
ever
have
the
chance
to
drink
one
overall
an
ok
doppelbock
but
the
mouthfeel
was
just
too
thin
for
me
to
want
more
no
comparison
to
ettaler
or
samichlaus
the
germans
have
it
very
good
d
very
drinkable
smooth
flavorful
and
balanced
all
around
this
is
a
beer
of
the
style
that
would
be
really
good
with
food
its
not
like
celebrator
but
abv
and
body
make
it
more
drinkable
bottle
poured
a
deep
burgundy
color
bock
with
large
dirty
brown
color
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
banana
ester
with
some
dry
fruits
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
dark
fruit
taste
with
ester
of
banana
and
some
sweet
malt
body
is
about
average
with
some
creamy
notes
and
good
carbonation
with
no
distinguishable
alcohol
well
done
but
it
would
have
been
even
better
to
get
a
fresher
bottle
d
this
is
one
drinkable
doppelbock
i
would
definitely
not
be
opposed
to
having
again
nicely
drinkable
without
the
heaviness
of
some
doppelbocks
and
a
wellcrafted
version
of
the
style
from
one
of
bavarias
greatest
brauereien
ultimately
the
beer
is
exceptionally
drinkable
no
mean
feat
for
a
beer
weighing
in
at
7
4
theres
not
a
hint
of
it
on
the
palate
although
the
rich
heavy
character
intimates
that
something
is
going
on
here
a
big
beer
and
a
very
good
doppelbock
an
exemplar
of
the
style
d
astonishingly
easy
to
pound
back
especially
considering
the
abv
overall
a
quality
example
of
german
brewing
it
cant
quite
go
toetotoe
with
celebrator
as
far
as
doppelbocks
go
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
i
dont
think
id
want
to
have
it
by
itself
though
id
rather
follow
the
weihenstephan
web
pages
suggestion
and
try
it
with
some
smoked
meat
or
fish
it
is
very
drinkable
i
found
that
it
was
better
after
a
few
more
sips
d
this
a
good
doppelbock
a
lot
sweeter
than
i
expected
it
to
be
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
i
wouldnt
have
expected
anything
less
from
weihenstephaner
overall
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
goes
down
surprisingly
quickly
for
the
higher
abv
this
one
was
definitely
unique
in
the
doppelbock
style
instead
of
being
a
huge
sweet
malt
bomb
this
one
had
a
porterlike
quality
to
it
this
may
not
have
been
to
style
per
se
but
it
was
enjoyable
in
itself
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
these
in
the
future
d
doppelbocks
are
surprisingly
drinkable
considering
their
higher
abvs
overall
its
not
as
good
as
some
other
doppelbocks
ive
had
so
therefore
not
quite
as
drinkable
i
think
i
paid
3
75
or
4
for
the
bottle
this
bottle
was
far
from
it
i
will
have
to
try
again
d
i
just
had
the
ayinger
celebrator
a
few
nights
ago
and
i
like
korbinian
better
for
a
few
reasons
first
more
appealing
look
than
any
other
second
smooth
more
consistent
flavor
that
is
malty
but
better
balanced
with
some
leafy
earthy
hops
flavor
third
17oz
for
a
good
price
especially
for
an
excellent
dopplebock
so
it
hits
the
point
on
value
last
the
feel
is
the
best
around
due
to
the
uniquely
low
carbonation
quotient
my
favorite
dopplebock
did
not
notice
the
moderately
high
abv
very
easy
drinking
sessionable
the
more
weihenstephaner
beers
i
try
the
more
i
respect
appreciate
and
admire
this
brewery
this
to
me
was
one
of
those
beers
you
discover
every
so
often
that
is
like
an
epiphany
how
did
i
not
find
you
sooner
oh
but
the
flavor
luxuriously
creamy
and
malty
with
layer
upon
layer
of
dark
wheat
caramel
toasted
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
finishes
with
a
light
bittering
of
german
hops
and
some
roast
that
blend
well
with
a
hint
of
booze
and
yeasty
goodness
mouthfeel
is
nearperfect
with
a
velvety
medium
body
and
wellcrafted
carbonation
level
but
a
slight
chalkiness
keeps
it
from
the
5
0
department
overall
korbinian
is
a
delicious
brew
that
thankfully
shies
away
from
the
more
boozeintensive
notes
other
dopplebocks
tend
to
favor
id
certainly
purchase
it
again
da
great
example
of
a
doppelbock
were
dealing
with
pros
here
quite
drinkable
at
this
abv
500ml
bottle
served
in
a

glass
poured
a
beautiful

with

fingers

and
dark
fruit

some

rich

flavor
with
some

and
more

not
overly
sweet
very

very
drinkable
i
liked
this
a
lot
if
you
are
a
fan
of
german
malt
flavor
you
should
try
this
i
could
get
to
like
these
d
i
could
easily
overlook
the
drying
quality
of
this
beer
to
enjoy
them
all
night
delicious
complex
and
beautiful
korbinian
is
a
winner
when
it
comes
to
dopplebocks
i
strongly
recommend
you
try
it
out
if
you
have
not
already
superb
beer
mid
sized
german
style

interesting
and
hard
to
describe
dark

with
hues
of
translucent

dark
dark

of
the
road
khaki
cap
and
then
doesnt
leave
much
if
any
lace
to
get
excited
about
dark

nose
and
then
an
onslaught
of
com0lexity
and
intrigue
more

ripe

chocolate

and
continuing

tasty
stuff
d
since
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
for
its
richness
and
compatibility
with
bold
food
i
could
probably
drink
this
all
night
with
everything
from
the
starting
salad
to
a
rich
baklava
the
brew
most
assuredly
has
the
complexity
and
character
to
compliment
the
entire
meal
drinkability
a
great
way
to
close
off
a
session
of
sweeter
beers
or
as
a
standalone
for
the
evening
this
is
one
of
my
preferred
doppelbocks
with
the
celebrator
and
ill
be
coming
back
for
the
forseeable
future
i
want
more
of
this
one
very
drinkable
d
i
cant
finish
the
bottle
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
i
can
appreciate
what
the
beers
trying
to
be
d
the
taste
wasnt
amazing
but
this
beer
seemed
so
thin
that
i
could
put
a
few
of
these
down
most
of
the
weihenstephaner
beers
ive
had
have
been
that
way
mfd
the
beer
goes
down
smooth
the
feel
is
not
too
thick
just
about
right
and
makes
for
a
great
beer
to
have
at
lunch
overall
this
is
pretty
solid
doppelbock
but
i
think
there
are
better
german
doppels
out
there
worth
trying
though
nice
dark
red
color
transparent
smells
a
lot
like
cereal
or
grains
grape
nuts
the
taste
is
very
malty
some
fruit
clean
germans
arent
usually
my
thing
but
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
one
i
will
revisit
in
the
hopes
of
learning
something

a

d
awesome

and

of

from

brewery
i
love
this
beer
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
this
year
for
sure
and
its
very
affordable
to
boot
ive
seen
it
for
under
3
here
in
w
mass
deep
brown
very
clear
nice
head
with
great
lacing
light
in
the
nose
wet
leaves
and
earth
i
should
probably
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
more
anyway
tastes
like
a
nut
brown
ale
hugely
nutty
big
and
malty
a
bit
sweet
easy
going
down
with
nice
body
what
a
fine
beer
from
the
weihenstephaner
brewery
this
could
be
a
sweet
session
beer
on
a
cold
night
since
the
abv
is
very
manageable
this
beer
gets
better
with
each
sip
t
m
d
like
a
brown
sugar
cookie
wedded
to
toasted
barley
shot
through
with
a
slightly
higherthanaverage
dose
of
alcohol
the
germans
know
what
theyre
doing
here
the
alcohol
marries
the
darker
beerier
flavors
with
the
sweeter
ones
suppressing
the
bitterness
of
the
former
and
the
sugariness
of
the
latter
resulting
in
an
absurdly
drinkable
yet
rich
beer
this
beer
along
with
most
of
weihenstephans
offerings
underscores
the
level
of
precision
with
which
germans
brew
their
beers
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
feels
a
little
thinner
but
not
much
than
i
would
like
but
still
rich
and
creamy
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
notes
i
was
really
excited
to
try
the
korbinian
and
while
it
wasnt
awful
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
i
will
definitely
have
to
give
it
another
try
sometime
as
i
think
this
one
may
be
a
bit
elderly
why
no
freshness
date
still
i
can
tell
just
by
the
flavors
that
are
there
that
this
could
be
a
really
good
doppelbock

very
drinkable
a
well
integrated
drop
the
highish
abv
is
not
really
noticeable
this
is
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
ive
ever
had
taste
not
as
big
of
a
taste
as
salvator
delivers
but
its
still
real
good
notes
i
still
cant
believe
i
never
had
this
ive
had
better
dopplebocks
but
i
can
only
imagine
this
ontap
i
bet
thatd
be
a
treat
darn
good
beer
this
beer
is
big
rich
and
balanced
as
only
the
germans
can
do
it
is
a
lusciously
creamy
beer
full
of
malt
but
never
overly
syrupy
or
sweet
it
glows
magenta
brown
with
a
frothy
head
and
moderate
lacing
the
nose
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
subtle
hop
tartness
the
flavor
has
huge
maltcentric
complexity
there
are
flavors
of
oak
chocolate
caramel
vanilla
nutty
grain
and
soft
yeasty
dough
the
finish
is
unobtrusively
bitter
the
beer
coats
the
mouth
pleasantly
but
never
stickily
and
the
feel
is
velvet
smooth
this
doppelbock
is
very
much
bread
in
a
mug
with
oodles
of
malt
flavor
the
balance
of
flavors
really
pushes
the
korbinian
over
and
above
the
vast
majority
of
similar
big
bocks
weihenstephaners
korbinian
is
an
absolutely
fantastic
beer
and
shows
off
the
depth
and
quality
of
german
brewing
its
dangerously
good
d
definitely
not
a
session
beer
at
least
not
for
me
this
is
a
great
beer
to
take
your
time
with
and
appreciate
or
enjoy
with
a
cigar
if
youre
so
inclined
could
also
go
well
with
strong
cheese
drinkability
with
the
great
smooth
taste
it
is
the
type
of
beer
that
can
quickly
disappear
from
your
reserves
a
good
job
making
it
full
enough
to
counteract
the
higher
alcohol
a
pretty
tasty
doppelbock
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
but
complex
enough
to
be
interesting
and
enjoyable
big
molassessweet
beer

ruddybrown
with

thick

i
was
looking

in
thsi
doppel
alcoholic
bite
in
the
finish
exceptionally
smooth
and
just
heavy
enough
to
enjoy
d
one
of
these
was
enough
very
different
than
what
im
used
to
and
very
complex
a
fantastic
bargain
brew
but
the
sweetness
got
to
me
after
a
while
a
great
doppelbock
and
a
very
enjoyable
brew
one
that
i
would
definitely
revisit
given
the
opportunity
a

d
very
nice
beer
all
around
well
worth
a
try
the
low
carbonation
and
rich
flavor
tend
to
make
this
beer
feel
bigger
than
it
is
its
full
of
dark
fruits
like
cherries
blackberries
and
plums
along
with
black
licorice
and
a
ting
of
cocoa
powder
the
body
is
thick
but
smooth
and
this
beer
is
resonably
drinkable
if
you
take
it
nice
and
slow
d
great
flavor
throughout
the
life
of
this
beer
alcohol
is
noticeable
a
bit
in
taste
and
moreso
in
affect
after
an
entire
bottle
certainly
worth
seeking
out
for
any
fan
of
the
doppelbock
style
found
at
a
new
store
down
in
the
big
city
to
the
south
brown
pour
very
brown
mild
head
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
is
of
bakery
sweet
rolls
rather
malty
and
sugary
filling
mouthfeel
real
smooth
finish
bites
a
little
flavor
is
too
sugary
sweet
for
my
liking
but
this
being
a
dopplebock
its
not
a
surprise
bready
with
decent
malt
content
its
one
and
out
for
this
brew
d
very
pleasant
drinkability
and
loved
every
sip
of
it
perfect
by
example
and
one
i
could
drink
again
and
again
the
thing
i
love
about
this
dunkel
is
the
refined
profile
from
the
nose
to
the
finish
not
to
sweet
or
strong
like
some
dunkels
this
is
a
malt
forward
dark
lager
that
has
a
refined
taste
and
a
very
smooth
finish
like
the
hefe
these
guys
are
alla
about
top
notch
quality
perfect
fall
beer
d
its
a
great
sipper
full
of
flavor
the
only
keeping
me
back
from
another
is
the
higher
alcohol
content
id
look
for
this
one
again
another
fine
beer
from
weihenstephaner
totally
drinkable
the
higher
abv
7

is
masked
well
by
a
complex
aroma
and
distinctly
dry
but
sweet
flavor
a
great
doppelbock
for
sure
nice
looking
beer
with
rich
melanoiden
aroma
with
some
roastiness
and
fruit
tastes
similar
to
aroma
very
drinkable
with
good
attenuation
and
correctly
no
hop
bitterness
slightly
coats
the
tongue
one
of
the
more
roasty
dbs
but
not
overyl
so
very
good
beer
as
are
most
from
this
brewery
a
very
nice
beer
one
that
is
all
too
easy
to
drink
given
the
abv
fairly
drinkable
beer
drinkability
is
good
this
is
probably
a
one
a
night
beer
for
me
but
man
its
complex
and
one
is
a
very
nice
treat
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
decent
tan
head
that
fades
smells
of
sweet
malts
and
some
brown
sugar
tastes
of
very
smooth
malts
with
some
caramel
flavor
and
texture
no
hoppyness
or
bitter
taste
very
clean
its
has
a
nice
rich
mouthfeel
and
it
goes
down
easy
i
highly
reccomend
extremely
drinkable
for
such
a
complex
beer
its
the
first
doppelbock
ive
had
but
i
plan
on
having
more
of
the
style
and
of
this
particular
one
as
well
overall
a
very
nice
doppelbock
that
gives
celebrator
a
run
for
its
money
d
a
big
bold
beer
for
sure
but
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
theres
a
great
balance
between
the
roasted
flavors
and
sweet
stuff
making
this
all
too
easy
to
drink
quickly
a
great
beer
for
sure
this
doppelbock
pours
a
nice
dark
rubyred
with
an
off
white
head
that
fades
slowly
the
smell
shows
off
a
generous
malt
bill
with
a
lot
of
roasted
caramel
aromas
the
taste
is
very
full
of
malt
with
a
smooth
sweet
finish
the
moderate
co2
and
full
body
make
this
an
enjoyable
beer
thaks
weswes
split
this
with
my
fatherinlaw
over
the
weekend
poured
into
a
chalice
a
burnt
caramel
brown
with
a
thin
sandy
head
which
quickly
faded
to
nothing
leaving
speckled
lacing
on
the
inside
of
my
glass
aroma
was
dark
fruit
and
malt
figs
raisins
reminded
me
of
port
wine
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
a
little
loose
and
slippery
with
medium
carbonation
taste
was
full
of
dark
fruit
figs
plums
dates
with
a
bit
of
a
chocolate
background
and
a
slightly
sour
vinous
finish
drinkability
is
high
despite
the
abv
due
to
the
interesting
complexities
of
the
taste
that
kept
me
interested
in
identifying
all
the
different
flavors
overall
this
was
quite
an
interesting
brew
and
i
may
pick
another
one
up
to
keep
for
myself
deep
dark
copper
color
not
cloudy
persistant
light
khaki
colored

is
sweet
full
maltiness
toffee
roastiness
and
solvent
mouthfeel

rich
with
a
lighter
clean

drinkability
is
wonderful
taste
is
raisin
prune
tartness
cranberry
roasted
coffee
wine
chocolate
and
cherries
all
wrapped
in
a
nice
bow
of
crispness
in
the
finish
intense
full
flavor
of
kilned
malt
with
a
definite
alcoholic
aftertaste
pretty
low
bitterness
heavy
mouthfeel
is
a
good
consistency
pretty
smooth
carbonation
is
minimal
definite
coffee
flavors
swirling
around
with
the
alcohol
tasty
the
soy
sauce
thing
carries
through
to
the
taste
something
that
is
interesting
but
im
not
wild
about
ehhh
saltiness
in
a
beer
is
just
a
little
strange
but
i
do
like
it
sometimes
overall
a
unique
flavor
profile
and
a
solid
doppelbock
very
good
example
of
the
style
recommended
mfd
chewy
and
delicious
an
excellent
example
of
the
doppelbock
syle
a
must
try
thanks
to
my
brother
pojo41
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
poured
an
attractive
dark
brownreddish
color
with
a
good
head
that
didnt
dissipate
too
quickly
aroma
was
very
malty
flavor
was
also
very
malty
with
hints
of
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
was
good
this
was
a
very
nice
doppelbock
22
oz
would
be
a
good
amount
to
drink
the
alcohol
taste
is
a
little
to
prominent
to
want
to
much
very
drinkable
dopplebock
this
beer
is
a
bold
offering
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
or
so
it
says
it
is
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
on
the
bottle
that
impressed
me
by
the
smooth
bittersweet
drinkability
of
a
true
german
beer
drinkability
a
great
classic
doppelbock
really
nice
full
malt
bill
not
too
light
nor
too
dark
and
with
a
very
nice
manageable
alcohol
level
pours
dark
brown
with
a
chestnut
hue
with
thick
tan
rocky
head
that
leaves
a
few
lines
of
delicate
lace
aroma
of
roaster
malts
and
a
little
sweetness
caramel
and
even
maybe
a
hint
of
sour
apple
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
with
light
hop
bitterness
and
a
rich
malty
aftertaste
and
a
slightly
sweet
finish
full
bodied
with
a
creamy
texture
and
mild
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
beer
with
an
excellent
mouthfeel
and
clean
malty
flavor
this
is
a
brick
in
the
stomach
though
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
wouldnt
really
work
on
a
hot
day
not
a
refreshing
beerdefinately
a
nitecap
beer
drinkability
oh
its
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
barely
perceptible
which
is
impressive
for
a
7
4
abv
brew
i
plan
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
during
the
coldweather
months
it
goes
down
smooth
sweet
and
delicious
and
it
leaves
you
thirsty
for
more
whats
not
to
like
drinkability
is
good
probably
the
best
dopp
ive
had
very
good
a
great
beer
and
a
wonderful
example
of
a
dopplebock
get
some
why
dont
you
get
this
beer
go
to
the
gym
and
pump
each
other
d
a
wonderful
doppelbock
full
on
flavor
but
not
overly
sweet
love
the
prunechocolate
notes
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
drinkability
was
fineone
and
i
was
done
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
syrupy
super
malty
sweetness
keeps
the
drinkability
from
being
very
high
this
one
is
good
but
there
are
a
few
better
ones
out
there
overall
a
one
and
done
beer
for
me
i
love
their
other
beers
but
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
oh
well
guess
ill
just
have
to
buy
more
of
their
world
class
hefe
overall
another
outstanding
and
nicely
balanced
german
doppelbock
recommended
d
this
is
defintely
a
malt
bomb
nice
flavor
and
very
thick
perfect
for
a
winters
night
not
quite
a
session
ale
but
an
enjoyable
drinker
poured
a
syrupy
brown
body
with
heavy
carbonation
and
a
twofinger
head
that
died
quickly
but
left
lace
rings
it
smelled
a
little
dry
and
grainy
with
an
alcohol
smell
noticeable
but
also
malts
like
roast
and
chocolate
are
prevelant
a
semicreamy
smooth
mediumbodied
beer
that
contains
some
sweetness
thanks
to
roasted
chocolate
caramel
and
butterscotch
malts
at
least
thats
what
i
tasted
with
a
crisp
slightly
dry
backbite
with
some
toffee
and
coffee
malts
even
though
this
is
a
little
simplistic
i
could
session
this
and
recommend
it
to
anyone
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
with
a
nice
light
tan
head
nose
is
nice
and
malty
with
that
respective
lagery
graininess
taste
is
quite
nice
with
a
good
malty
kick
grainy
lager
flavor
some
really
nice
caramel
and
sugar
flavors
through
the
middle
mouthfeel
is
just
about
perfect
here
really
very
good
dry
finish
drinkability
is
second
to
very
few
here
really
couldnt
ask
for
a
more
drinkable
doppelbock
this
being
the
first
time
i
have
delved
into
weihenstephaner
products
outside
of
their
wheat
wizardry
i
am
quite
impressed
a
very
solid
brewing
company
and
one
any
german
fan
will
not
be
let
down
in
purchasing
strongly
recommended
d
while
doppelbock
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
i
tried
this
one
because
weihenstephaner
does
such
good
work
this
one
like
their
other
efforts
is
well
done
and
drinkable
d
a
very
good
dopplebock
from
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
one
of
the
class
of
its
style
for
sure
d
a
nice
combination
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
will
not
be
able
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
because
of
its
strong
malts
that
tend
to
fill
you
up
overall
a
good
beer
and
recommended
big
flavorful
and
sweet
drinkability
a
very
quaffable
brew
this
one
and
at
3
bucks
a
pop
very
affordable
i
repeat
celebrator
is
the
god
of
doppels
until
someone
else
climbs
mount
olympus
to
unseat
it
but
for
the
price
ill
probably
have
this
one
slightly
more
often
i
used
it
in
the
preparation
of
doppelbockthai
pork
balls
served
with
a
spicy
peanut
sauce
with
snap
peas
and
rice
noodles
a
glass
of
it
along
with
the
meal
was
a
divine
pairing
this
would
be
good
with
an
array
of
desserts
as
well
i
was
already
an
unabashed
fan
of
the
other
offerings
from
this
brewer
and
i
am
once
again
tasked
with
finding
superlatives
that
do
justice
to
the
absolute
superiority
of
another
of
their
drinks
calling
this
beer
outstanding
simply
fails
to
it
justice
and
while
excellent
certainly
seems
a
more
accurate
praise
im
think
in
love
and
in
acknowledging
that
with
my
rosecoloredglasses
firmly
in
place
ill
simply
say
that
no
compliment
short
of
magnificent
will
do
as
my
adjective
of
choice
to
describe
this
nectarofthegods
this
luscious
concoction
weihenstephaner
calls
korbinian
there
arent
many
lagers
ive
had
that
i
really
enjoy
but
doppelbocks
have
been
an
exception
this
is
another
nice
one
definitely
recommended
d
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
feels
like
a
big
brew
i
love
this
beer
and
i
love
this
brewery
i
can
drink
this
all
day
i
love
my
german
beers
d
this
is
very
drinkable
i
could
almost
pound
the
beer
it
is
so
easy
to
drink
served
in
my
leute
bok
glass
poured
a
deep
opaque
brownblack
oneinch
dense
offwhite
head
with
lots
of
tiny
ringlets
embedded
in
the
foam
head
eventually
settled
into
a
slick
of
foam
that
coalesced
around
the
shoulders
no
lacing
adhered
during
the
tasting
scents
of
dark
fruit
malt
toffee
and
molasses
nose
was
extremely
complex
and
difficult
differentiate
all
of
the
aromas
taste
consisent
with
nose
however
complexity
seemed
to
strike
a
more
even
balance
in
the
mouth
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
light
considering
the
bold
nose
and
flavors
not
much
carbonation
present
and
alcohol
was
very
wellhidden
im
not
typically
a
fan
of
the
style
but
have
been
so
impressed
by
weihenstephaners
other
offerings
that
i
thought
it
was
worthy
of
a
try
i
was
not
dissapointed
if
theres
a
downside
its
the
watery
mouthfeel
still
a
great
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
red
hue
when
held
to
the
light
and
a
generous
tan
head
that
dissipated
somewhat
quickly
into
a
tiny
layer
smells
like
a
typical
dopplebock
dark
fruit
dark
sweet
malt
tastes
are
sweet
bready
malt
flavors
some
caramel
and
little
hop
presence
alcohol
is
hidden
quite
nicely
good
full
bodied
mouthfeel
and
decent
carbonation
level
help
add
to
the
nice
drinkability
especially
for
a
7
4
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
malty
german
lagers
and
this
is
no
exception
great
beer
that
i
would
love
to
drink
some
more
of
but
this
damn
bottle
went
and
emptied
itself
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
medium
slightly
tan
head
very
little
lacing
aroma
is
carmel
raisins
and
chocolate
taste
is
sweet
but
tempered
by
some
bitterness
from
the
roasted
malt
notes
of
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
caramel
some
herbal
hops
but
the
malt
is
the
big
story
here
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
maybe
a
bit
syrupy
fairly
heavy
but
a
5l
is
easily
drinkable
not
my
favorite
doppelbock
but
still
pretty
tasty
stuff
i
was
excited
when
i
first
saw
this
in
my
downtown
beer
store
but
it
seemed
to
fall
when
i
popped
it
open
at
home
pours
with
a
lack
luster
head
and
has
a
molasses
toffee
strange
sugar
aroma
1
in
5
americans
has
genital
herpes
some
nice
flavours
and
abv
is
well
hidden
but
it
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
happy
to
try
it
happier
i
wont
have
to
again
the
palate
is
full
of
rich
caramelly
dark
malt
up
front
while
some
lighter
notes
of
toffee
and
lightroast
coffee
come
through
before
the
swallow
the
finish
is
full
of
dark
fruity
notes
and
more
brown
sugar
that
lingers
for
a
while
in
the
back
of
the
throat
body
is
rich
and
full
but
not
too
thick
while
the
alcohol
is
wellintegrated
this
is
still
a
bit
too
strong
to
drink
like
a
session
beer
nevertheless
this
is
a
wellbuilt
doppelbock
and
one
that
im
glad
is
finally
making
its
way
to
oregon
pour
me
another
please
i
could
drink
these
all
night
md
full
bodied
and
very
slick
in
the
mouth
a
great
doppelbock
and
very
drinkable
clear
and
quite
dark
brown
in
color
bottle
looks
cool
too
tan
head
that
i
couldnt
seem
to
get
too
tall
when
pouring
but
lacey
smells
somewhat
like
a
subdued
rauchbier
with
notes
of
smoke
and
jerky
almost
like
dogfood
haha
the
least
pleasant
feature
of
this
experience
at
first
it
tastes
smokey
that
tingles
in
accordance
with
the
hop
profile
as
it
warms
the
caramelly
malts
come
through
this
stuff
is
restorative
but
not
too
thick
but
certainly
not
watery
never
found
any
moment
where
it
was
too
sweet
i
almost
wanted
a
little
more
bready
sweetness
in
this
suggested
pours
a
clear
brownish
red
with
a
medium
sized
tan
head
aroma
is
wonderful
malty
caramel
a
slight
smoked
aroma
light
chocolate
notes
hops
and
dark
fruit
taste
is
a
distinct
mouth
filling
maltiness
caramel
chocolate
still
a
little
bit
of
smoke
lovely
combination
of
flavors
palate
is
lightly
bitter
and
a
light
malt
texture
this
is
the
first
time
i
saw
this
in
the
store
and
id
have
to
say
im
pleasantly
surprise
a
very
nice
doppelbock
definitely
recommended
this
beer
is
delicious
and
remarkably
easy
to
drink
considering
the
abv
finish
is
lightly
sweet
with
some
alcohol
warming
heaviness
precludes
supreme
drinkability
but
this
is
a
wellmade
amazing
effort
poured
from
bottle
to
pint
glass
pours
a
beautiful
color
like
a
dark
cherry
wood
crytal
clear
with
offwhite
head
very
poor
retention
and
no
lacing
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
some
bread
and
dark
fruit
smells
very
belgianlike
which
is
good
taste
is
great
as
well
very
complex
there
is
strong
malt
backbone
with
some
fruit
undertones
strong
caramel
presence
as
well
low
carbonation
leads
into
a
medium
mouthfeel
it
leaves
a
slightly
oily
sensation
in
the
mouth
overall
a
very
good
beer
my
200th
review
pours
a
deep
mahogany
w
a
thin
tan
cap
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
nice
lacing
in
my
pilsn
glass
a
moderate
smell
carameltoffee
aroma
with
hints
of
alcohol
and
dark
fruits
a
sweet
rich
malty
flavor
w
loads
of
caramel
and
dates
up
front
with
a
well
balanced
hop
bitterness
some
alcohol
and
metal
detected
in
the
fairly
crisp
finish
a
medfull
body
on
this
one
but
not
too
cloying
a
moderate
co2
level
an
excellent
brew
one
of
the
most
drinkable
dopplebocks
ive
ever
had
i
cant
wait
to
get
some
more
on
a
side
note
it
pairs
quite
well
w
pork
chops
pours
brown
in
color
with
a
very
nice
two
inch
beige
head
smell
is
all
toffee
and
malt
wonderful
taste
is
the
same
more
toffee
than
you
can
imagine
there
was
a
bit
of
grain
and
nuts
hidden
in
the
taste
as
well
incredibly
smooth
and
creamy
on
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
truly
great
bock
i
think
this
would
be
incredible
on
draft
i
would
be
inclined
to
drink
this
more
than
some
doppelbocks
just
because
the
sweetness
is
not
overdone
great
complexity
for
a
doppelbock
so
many
of
which
in
my
experience
tend
to
be
caramel
malt
and
little
else
i
think
id
still
take
a
celebrator
first
but
this
is
a
not
very
distant
2nd
well
i
see
what
all
the
fuss
was
about
now
this
is
absolutely
delicious
sweet
and
caramelly
with
a
nice
toasted
bread
flavor
and
also
that
hint
of
dark
fruit
what
is
thatcoming
in
right
at
the
finish
no
alcohol
present
in
this
bottle
just
a
sweet
malty
goodness
that
leaves
me
wishing
i
had
more
many
more
really
enjoyable
surprisingly
theres
something
quite
refreshing
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
here
that
i
havent
experienced
in
many
doppelbocks
before
will
definitely
get
again
pours
a
clear
color
which
changes
drastically
depending
the
light
its
up
against
has
brown
red
and
orange
copper
highlights
medium
head
falling
to
a
ring
steady
carbonation
smell
attacked
my
nose
right
when
i
popped
the
cap
huge
sweetness
was
the
impression
i
got
caramel
toffee
a
light
spice
and
some
fruit
glorious
toasted
grain
and
bread
taste
is
superb
a
delicate
sweetness
that
is
never
overdone
caramel
and
toffee
are
for
sure
there
again
hints
of
a
wonderful
nutty
flavor
and
again
this
luscious
bready
aftertaste
that
i
can
and
will
not
get
enough
of
give
me
another
damn
bottle
this
stuff
is
lovely
in
the
mouth
its
just
a
tad
more
full
than
youd
think
but
still
great
very
easy
going
down
a
solid
solid
brew
i
must
remember
to
pick
this
up
more
often
this
is
pretty
classic
doppelbock
but
not
as
good
as
ayinger
celebrator
which
is
a
slightly
better
representation
of
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
fairly
clear
deep
amber
ruby
brown
with
a
tannish
head
that
lingers
and
slightly
retains
the
smell
is
sweetish
malt
molasses
caramel
a
strong
toffeebutterscotch
backbone
and
just
nice
roasted
grains
there
is
a
sweetishness
to
the
smell
which
is
characteristic
of
the
style
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
not
much
carbonation
a
loads
of
character
the
taste
is
very
chewy
and
has
all
the
notes
you
get
in
the
aroma
toffee
butterscotch
loads
of
caramel
molasses
roasted
grains
there
is
a
puckerishness
to
the
beer
in
the
finish
the
beer
is
chewy
and
creamy
with
a
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
is
present
slightly
warming
with
no
throatiness
at
all
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
dobbelbock
lchaim
drinkability
is
high
for
the
abv
as
the
alcohol
hides
behind
the
malt
and
caramel
an
excellent
cold
night
warmer
cool
weather
refresher
and
compliment
to
a
hearty
meal
perfect
for
the
transition
from
winter
to
spring
glad
to
try
this
one
not
my
favorite
but
an
interesting
beer
on
all
accounts
i
rated
this
fairly
high
but
to
me
it
only
slightly
eclipses
optimator
and
celebrator
the
mouthfeel
drinkability
and
appearance
were
all
spectacular
but
the
two
most
important
aspects
of
a
beer
for
me
aroma
and
taste
were
good
but
not
spectacular
the
alcohol
hit
is
more
pronounced
slightly
translucent
beer
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
looks
pretty
good
nose
is
alcohol
brown
sugar
and
malts
taste
is
euro
hops
raw
sugar
and
slight
alcohol
a
bit
of
a
wild
flavor
more
alcohol
on
warming
mouthfeel
is
foamy
and
yet
full
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
weizen
glass
poured
dark
brown
with
ruby
hues
forming
an
even
12
inch
tan
sticky
head
leaving
behind
speckled
lacing
with
each
sip
big
malt
smells
from
this
one
followed
by
prunes
raisins
and
figs
sweet
malty
taste
with
a
light
pancake
syrup
flavor
finishing
with
a
slight
wine
sweetness
light
carbonation
and
medium
body
leaving
the
mouth
feeling
slick
between
sips
very
nice
beer
although
a
little
on
the
barleywine
sweet
side
definitely
worth
trying
this
one
is
a
meal
in
a
bottle
heavy
malts
without
any
of
that
hoppiness
or
estery
yeast
flavors
to
get
in
the
way
this
is
a
better
example
of
a
doppelbock
one
to
be
enjoyed
recommended
overall
very
good
but
not
my
favourite
doppelbock
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
dab
mug
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
light
amber
hue
surprisingly
big
head
along
with
this
beer
smell
is
relatively
subdued
and
somewhat
sour
taste
is
a
mixture
of
nuts
grain
and
a
little
bit
of
bitter
fruit
a
mediumbodied
beer
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
pretty
damn
drinkable
d
outstanding
another
impressive
brew
from
a
solid
brewery
i
could
go
for
another
anytime
big
reco
here
taste
the
aroma
lied
this
is
a
very
rich
beer
with
all
of
the
features
i
love
so
much
about
doppelbocks
huge
malt
punch
primarily
caramel
with
a
slight
chocolate
note
and
a
hint
of
toasted
bread
balance
comes
in
the
midpalate
where
there
is
some
faint
balancing
hop
just
enough
finishes
very
smooth
with
a
slight
fleeting
alcohol
burn
in
the
back
of
the
throat
just
to
remind
you
of
the
7
4
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
velvety
with
those
muted
chocolate
notes
sliding
across
the
palate
delicately
theres
a
backing
dark
fruit
and
toffee
character
which
serves
to
prop
up
the
malt
without
getting
too
heavy
on
the
tongue
especially
in
the
finish
an
impressive
showing
actually
and
a
definite
uniqueness
compared
to
other
of
its
ilk
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
well
balanced
unlike
many
domestic
interpretations
the
germans
definately
make
the
best
dopple
which
really
is
no
surprise
another
great
offering
from
one
of
germanys
most
dependable
brewers
whatever
they
do
they
do
very
well
prost
d
good
drinkability
a
very
pleasing
doppelbock
highly
recommend
would
be
awesome
alongside
a
meal
good
job
old
bay
carrying
this
one
beer
poured
brown
with
ruby
undertones
head
was
perfect
upon
initial
pour
but
quickly
dissapated
nose
is
very
malty
with
strong
dark
fruits
present
taste
is
a
blast
of
toasted
malts
dark
fruits
slightly
balanced
by
some
light
hopping
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
all
about
the
classic
weihenstephaner
yeast
which
glides
the
beer
across
the
palate
it
is
surprisingly
lighter
than
what
i
would
have
expected
for
the
style
drinkability
is
very
good
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
flavors
somewhat
complex
and
the
smoothness
is
very
satisfying
another
fine
beer
from
my
favorite
german
brewer
d
yep
like
most
german
beer
id
like
to
add
that
this
beer
improved
as
it
warms
imo
i
served
at
the
recommended
temperature
and
found
it
to
feel
a
little
thin
and
lack
some
flavor
however
as
it
warmed
it
felt
a
little
thicker
which
i
really
like
and
the
flavors
came
out
more
never
had
seen
this
anywhere
and
only
have
had
this
brewerys
hefeweiss
so
i
decided
to
check
this
one
out
surprsingly
very
good
one
of
my
friends
said
it
was
one
of
the
best
beers
he
has
ever
had
do
not
know
about
that
but
still
rather
tasty
stuff
would
drink
again
recommended
drinkability
on
this
one
is
fantastic
very
refreshing
and
approachable
nothing
overpowering
with
any
of
the
flavors
a
great
wellbalanced
beer
it
starts
off
with
a
maltysweet
flavor
that
is
followed
up
by
a
nice
slightly
hop
finish
it
goes
down
quiet
smooth
without
a
bitter
after
taste
dability
not
as
syrupy
sweet
as
some
doppelbocks
so
probably
more
drinkable
than
some
hazy
burntcaramel
amber
in
color
with
a
yellowish
white
head
and
thin
lacing
running
down
the
glass
nose
of
plum
molasses
caramel
fresh
bread
and
some
dark
cherry
smells
oh
so
sweet
tasted
of
prunes
and
raisins
some
molasses
a
slight
bit
nutty
with
some
bitterness
coming
in
on
the
back
end
very
drinkable
very
good
truly
one
fantastic
dopplebock
im
going
to
have
to
put
this
head
to
head
with
celebrator
as
this
just
might
have
a
shot
at
the
title
d
very
tasty
and
very
complex
and
well
balanced
mix
of
flavors
but
the
lack
of
a
solid
enough
backbone
of
carbonation
sort
of
make
this
one
difficult
to
drink
and
entire
bottle
of
before
the
sweetness
began
to
take
the
beer
over
still
not
bad
at
all
aroma
and
flavor
still
the
same
old
doppelbock
big
caramel
maltiness
with
a
flash
of
hop
leaf
prominent
munich
yeast
strain
big
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
finish
is
spicy
with
a
lot
of
sweetness
never
gets
cloying
or
sticky
outstanding
doppelbock
out
of
the
keg
overall
this
a
very
good
doppelbock
as
for
the
characteristics
there
is
everything
here
one
would
expect
for
the
style
anything
less
from
a
german
brewer
would
pretty
much
be
an
insult
the
abv
isnt
too
high
which
keeps
the
drinkability
fairly
solid
my
only
complaint
would
be
maybe
just
a
bit
more
fruity
flavors
than
i
tend
to
like
for
the
style
that
said
i
like
drinking
my
doppelbocks
at
nearly
cellar
temp
so
this
tends
to
bring
out
many
different
flavors
d
great
taste
and
texture
cant
really
complain
the
body
is
medium
very
crisp
the
flavors
wash
away
quite
clean
as
well
leaving
only
a
gentle
lingering
of
the
spicy
hops
and
chocolate
quite
an
enjoyable
drink
aside
from
the
unfortunate
nose
d
excellent
taste
makes
this
easier
to
quaff
than
the
abv
wouldshould
allow
alcohol
is
well
hidden
d
this
is
another
very
good
beer
from
weihenstephaner
this
is
one
of
those
good
enjoyable
sipper
brews
oelergud
very
smooth
on
the
palate
with
great
carbonation
and
a
nice
mediumfull
body
a
bit
too
sweet
to
be
incredibly
drinkable
maybe
the
problem
is
from
having
hot
sauce
before
the
drink
i
would
call
this
one
a
one
timer
i
want
go
back
unless
it
was
the
only
one
left
the
finish
lingered
and
it
was
sweetly
meaty
making
a
fine
transition
right
through
to
the
end
i
have
to
get
more
make
some
stew
with
it
and
then
drink
it
too
d
this
one
easy
brew
to
drink
medium
bodied
well
balanced
moderate
abv
great
from
start
to
finish
not
that
i
would
want
to
finish
drinking
this
until
after
a
long
long
session
appearance
dark
brow
almost
black
hints
of
orange
on
edges
one
finger
tan
head
that
left
a
nice
layer

for
such
sweet
7
4
abv
beer
goes
down
mighty
quick
without
wrecking
your
tounge
or
turning
your
stomach
drinkability
is
good
although
this
is
a
strong
brew
both
in
profile
and
alcoholic
presence
the
flavors
and
aromas
combine
into
an
enjoyable
doppelbock
cheers
strong
throughout
this
doppelbock
is
full
of
malt
and
mouthfeel
a
really
good
beer
this
is
one
massive
malt
bomb
of
a
beer
absolutely
incredible
i
loves
me
a
malty
and
delicious
doppelbock
and
this
is
the
best
i
have
tasted
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
of
this
nectar
of
the
gods
i
know
this
is
heresy
but
i
dont
get
the
great
reviews
of
this
brew
the
only
other
doppelbock
ive
had
is
optimator
which
i
love
and
have
had
on
many
occasions
i
also
love
weihenstephaner
hefe
and
get
into
highabv
belgians
also
but
this
beer
is
so
alcoholic
it
seems
like
it
should
be
medicine
i
guess
im
just
not
man
enough
d
very
good
brew
would
drink
again
if
given
the
chance
purchased
a
1
pint
9
fl
oz
bottle
from
oak
tree
in
south
plainfield
weihenstehpaners
hefeweizen
was
an
outstanding
brew
so
i
had
high
hopes
for
their
doppelbock
brewed
under
the
purity
law
of
1516
on
the
logo
sticker
pours
a
grape
dark
ebony
hue
with
an
impressive
frothy
and
foamy
head
smell
was
complete
with
roasted
malts
figs
and
prunes
taste
strongly
complemented
the
aroma
along
with
noticeable
dark
sugars
caramel
and
dehyrdated
fruits
the
malt
flavor
really
dominates
this
one
an
excellent
depiction
of
the
style
with
a
wonderful
sugarsweet
thick
taste
incredibly
thick
and
rich
mouthfeel
and
a
good
drinkability
that
took
a
hit
because
of
the
ultrarich
and
ultrathick
flavor
and
mouthfeel
that
dominated
this
brew
good
stuff
good
representation
of
the
style
definitely
recommeneded
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
well
balanced
and
moderately
complex
that
suits
well
with
many
meals
korbinian
pours
a
modest
finger
of
tan
froth
on
a
mahogany
body
the
smell
is
wonderful
with
chocolate
hints
of
coffee
caramel
and
fruit
emerging
heavy
on
the
chocolate
same
with
the
taste
which
is
glorious
im
slightly
less
impressed
with
the
mouthfeel
which
veers
a
little
too
much
into
the
syrupy
but
is
ameliorated
with
fine
carbonation
in
sum
this
is
a
very
good
dopplebock
delicious
different
yet
easily
drinkable
well
worth
trying
this
is
a
great
easy
drinking
german
beer
weihenstephaner
brews
extremely
clean
flavorful
beer
with
nice
medium
body
the
korbinian
has
an
earthy
carmel
color
nice
light
head
and
a
wet
mouthfeel
this
is
a
great
beer
but
weihenstephaner
does
best
with
their
lighter
weizen
beers
in
my
opinion
overall
a
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
music
enjoyed
whilst
sampling
ring
of
fire
by
the
man
in
black
what
can
i
say
the
beer
speaks
for
itself
i
was
in
a
specialty
store
in
phx
looking
for
some
brew
and
found
this
ever
since
i
dont
want
to
drink
anything
else
no
matter
where
the
party
is
who
im
with
if
i
have
a
couple
bottles
of
korbinian
with
me
i
know
that
im
in
for
a
good
time
prost
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
poured
straight
into
a
glass
and
there
was
plenty
of
foam
for
about
10
mins
after
about
10
mins
the
foam
disapeared
and
it
looked
more
like
flat
coke
it
wasnt
overly
bitter
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
and
had
that
distinct
german
yeast
flavor
i
like
this
brand
of
beer
but
hefeweizens
are
more
of
my
type
i
wasnt
feeling
this
one
a
solid
beer
worthy
of
its
reputation
very
drinkable
as
the
alchohol
flavors
are
hardly
perceptable
and
the
beer
does
not
get
overly
sweet
or
heavy
on
the
palate
well
balanced
with
very
nice
flavors
coming
through
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
nice
head
and
lacing
good
scent
a
nice
malty
aroma
but
nothing
very
deep
very
good
taste
a
nice
maltiness
with
a
great
caramel
flavor
goes
down
great
could
not
even
detect
the
higher
abv
which
really
wasnt
that
high
for
a
good
doppel
an
excellent
beer
for
cold
winter
nights
or
to
welcome
the
spring
or
anytime
really
restorative
after
hard
play
at
the
beach
on
a
cold
day
nice
head
that
settles
quickly
and
pours
a
dark
brown
color
smell
is
of
carmel
and
mault
with
a
heavy
taste
of
mault
and
thickness
this
is
my
least
fav
type
of
beer
but
i
rated
it
based
on
the
others
ive
had
the
carmel
taste
and
smell
makes
it
better
than
the
others
i
have
had
though
d
fantastic
i
will
most
definitely
go
with
this
one
again
i
am
wishing
i
had
some
more
to
enjoy
at
least
one
more
bottle
d
drinkability
is
pretty
solid
it
goes
down
easy
enough
thats
for
sure
however
it
is
incredibly
sweet
and
i
dont
lnow
how
many
id
want
but
the
7
40
abv
is
not
in
evidence
at
all
and
it
makes
for
smooth
drinking
a
very
good
example
of
a
doppelbock
too
bad
i
didnt
have
this
in
my
possession
when
i
did
the
weihenstephaner
invite
many
months
ago
it
would
have
made
a
great
contestant
pours
a
clouded
ruby
brown
with
basically
no
head
that
falls
fast
nose
is
malty
and
sweet
smelling
flavor
is
rich
with
a
caramel
character
and
a
thick
body
of
ingredients
feel
is
smooth
with
a
nice
bubble
on
the
tongue
and
a
thicker
liquid
feel
that
is
slightly
silky
definitely
drinkable
easily
sessionable
damn
good
d
very
tasty
and
hits
the
spot
when
i
want
a
creamy
malty
brew
reasonably
priced
to
boot
ill
drink
this
again
ushering
in
the
new
year
with
a
weihenstephaners
korbinian
it
is
not
exactly
a
specialty
beer
but
definitely
a
renown
and
highly
acclaimed
beer
being
my
first
weihenstephaner
beer
i
guess
it
is
a
good
choice
of
a
usherinthenewyear
beer
ok
down
to
business
this
beer
pours
with
a
fairly
large
head
into
my
schneiderweisse
weizen
glass
not
the
weizen
style
huge
head
of
cos
but
a
1
inch
head
that
was
creamily
inviting
the
liquid
below
was
dark
ruby
brown
in
color
after
the
while
the
head
reduces
to
a
nice
thin
and
clingy
layer
above
the
nectar
below
the
smell
was
not
very
strong
but
the
malt
aromas
were
clear
with
a
nutty
yeasty
backing
i
could
also
detect
a
dash
of
spices
and
maybe
smoke
somewhere
and
some
caramel
notes
the
smell
could
really
have
been
stronger
than
this
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
true
malt
strength
with
strong
caramel
notes
and
very
subtle
sweetness
i
am
also
picking
up
spices
cloves
and
a
certain
nuttiness
here
the
finish
revealed
some
aromas
of
banana
and
some
dark
fruits
and
malts
were
also
picked
up
on
the
nose
the
after
taste
started
off
bready
malty
and
with
a
fair
amount
of
banana
it
slowly
reveals
some
notes
of
raisins
before
finally
fading
away
truly
a
great
taste
which
gets
a
little
better
as
the
beer
warms
the
mouthfeel
was
around
medium
body
or
slightly
thicker
with
an
apt
amount
of
carbonation
and
nice
creamy
smoothness
throughout
it
finishes
slightly
dry
i
pretty
enjoy
this
beer
still
prefer
belgian
dark
ales
but
this
one
really
hit
the
spot
for
tonight
i
prefer
it
to
the
andechsers
doppelbock
this
is
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
that
ive
had
and
i
will
continue
to
buy
it
dusty
aftertaste
with
liquorice
and
burnt
bitterness
in
the
end
but
the
quaff
was
topnotch
a
rich
and
malty
caramelchocolate
combo
platter
thats
not
overly
sweet

but
balanced
well
dopplealcohol
is
nowhere
to
distract
from
the
overall
enjoyment
of
this
sturdy
brew
drinkability
is
good
alcohol
is
almost
completely
hidden
love
the
big
malt
in
this
one
wish
this
one
was
available
locally
this
beer
poured
a
dark
clear
amber
color
and
formed
a
bubbly
light
tan
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
cocoa
and
coffee
the
flavor
was
of
malt
coffee
chocolate
and
plums
it
has
a
medium
light
body
with
a
slightly
sweet
finish
d
nice
doppelbock
its
very
tasty
but
i
suppose
i
didnt
expect
less
from
the
masters
at
weihenstephan
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
great
for
a
pub
with
some
chicken
wings
etc
i
will
be
drinking
it
again
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
brown
color
with
an
average
tan
head
that
dissipated
into
a
ring
around
the
glass
looks
very
much
like
cola
the
smell
is
of
raisins
molasses
and
light
bitter
chocolate
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
and
roasted
cashews
lightly
meaty
with
hints
of
chocolate
milk
and
dark
grapes
the
feel
is
well
bodied
with
prickly
carbonation
yet
finishes
smooth
though
a
bit
sticky
good
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
a
good
dopplebock
and
worth
a
try
quite
a
mellow
brew
overall
this
was
a
good
doppelbock
one
that
i
will
drink
again
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
nice
kick
good
representation
of
style
if
i
were
going
to
stick
with
a
good
sweet
beer
for
an
entire
evening
this
would
certainly
be
it
drinkability
fairly
good
but
one
bottle
is
plenty
due
to
the
assertive
sweetness
d
this
is
a
fun
beer
but
not
something
i
would
want
all
night
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
doppelbocks
its
neither
overly
sweet
nor
overly
alcoholic
a
musttry
for
any
doppelbock
fan
pours
a
clear
but
dark
brown
with
copper
highlights
and
a
beige
creamy
cap
heavy
malts
molasses
brown
sugar
hints
of
coffee
and
slight
ashy
or
smoky
character
malt
flavor
is
much
drier
and
roasted
than
the
nose
indicates
charred
sugars
some
caramel
and
some
fruity
prune
flavor
that
picks
up
as
it
warms
hops
offers
some
fruit
character
with
just
a
touch
of
pepper
at
the
end
yeasty
twang
is
slight
but
makes
a
nice
dynamic
between
the
malt
and
hops
caramel
and
coffee
notes
in
the
finish
zippy
carbonation
is
just
right
medium
body
and
a
smooth
rounded
mouthfeel
is
again
near
perfect
ok
so
here
is
where
it
starts
to
get
good
i
love
me
a
dopplebock
now
that
is
for
sure
when
i
saw
this
sitting
on
the
shelf
there
was
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
i
was
going
to
be
getting
it
just
had
to
be
poured
a
deep
dark
russet
brown
with
a
small
maybe
an
inch
or
so
of
off
white
head
grazing
over
the
top
of
it
there
was
significant
side
glass
lace
throughout
the
session
and
the
overall
look
of
it
was
quite
thick
the
aroma
was
of
slight
smoked
variety
a
little
bit
of
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
caramel
to
sweeten
in
up
the
taste
was
remarkably
smooth
and
delicious
great
full
body
on
this
one
definitely
not
thin
nice
and
mellow
smoky
flavor
with
a
huge
earthy
and
bread
like
back
a
nice
caramel
sugar
sweet
finish
brought
it
all
together
no
taste
of
alcohol
at
all
and
overall
it
was
a
very
easy
drinker
i
could
have
easily
had
another
the
carbonation
stayed
very
nice
throughout
the
session
i
would
have
to
say
one
of
my
favorites
so
far
this
was
very
tight
and
a
fine
brew
very
surprised
i
had
not
seen
it
earlier
as
it
is
always
around
will
be
getting
more
next
time
i
am
in
the
store
this
is
perfect
with
dinner
and
something
that
i
would
like
to
have
always
at
easy
reach
wow
this
is
definitely
the
most
drinkable
high
abv
beer
i
have
tried
it
is
quite
sweet
but
has
the
flavour
and
alcohol
bite
to
back
it
up
this
is
first
of
its
style
for
me
and
the
more
i
drank
the
more
i
liked
it
worth
the
exxy
price
and
the
premium
over
other
weihenstephaner
beers
very
good
for
a
dopplebock
has
a
tremendous
amount
of
flavor
and
really
fills
you
up
highly
reccomended
one
of
the
best
of
its
style
d
im
glad
i
finally
tried
another
weihenstephaner
this
time
not
a
wheat
now
i
can
confirm
i
like
their
whole
range
of
beers
weihenstephaner
korbinian
pours
a
dark
mahogany
colored
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
from
a
brown
half
liter
bottle
the
aroma
is
tremendously
malty
the
flavor
is
malt
malt
and
more
malt
and
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
an
absolute
must
for
malt
heads
extremely
well
made
and
tasty
recommended
i
would
pick
this
one
up
again
if
i
saw
it
on
the
shelf
d
spectacular
for
the
abv
and
level
of
richness
this
went
down
fairly
quickly
very
tasty
and
highly
recommended
pours
out
a
dark
maple
syrup
with
a
moderate
sized
beige
head
leaves
some
whispy
lacing
the
nose
is
all
coffee
raisins
and
chocolate
flavor
starts
off
with
loads
of
dried
fruits
which
then
segues
into
some
toasted
malts
towards
the
finish
the
malts
take
on
more
of
a
fully
roasted
quality
and
impart
chocolate
tones
as
well
finishes
relatively
dry
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
yet
not
exactly
sticky
carbonation
is
a
little
strong
for
me
here
impressive
one
of
the
better
dopples
i
have
had
excellent
d
quite
easy
for
such
a
beer
very
german
in
character
and
highly
recommended
drinkability
good
its
no
celebrator
but
its
a
very
good
representative
doppelbock
i
didnt
know
it
was
so
highly
rated
when
i
bought
it
nor
when
i
started
drinking
it
tend
to
think
its
a
tad
undeserved
but
still
very
good
drinkability
complex
and
good
body
but
light
dry
finish
this
is
easy
to
drink
this
brewery
does
not
make
a
bad
beer
and
here
is
just
another
example
this
beer
pours
an
brownish
burnt
orange
which
turns
to
a
sort
of
ruby
when
held
up
to
light
aroma
is
bigtime
malty
chocolate
grains
chocolate
cereal
like
cocoa
puffs
taste
is
dominate
by
the
malt
chocolate
taste
with
tinges
of
caramel
coffee
and
dates
bitterness
doesnt
hide
at
the
back
end
leaving
you
with
a
dry
but
refreshing
finish
this
beer
goes
down
clean
and
smooth
i
would
still
rank
celebrator
above
this
fine
brew
but
ill
still
make
room
for
it
on
my
beer
budget
pours
a
black
color
nice
carbonation
huge
three
finger
plus
creamy
tannish
head
lots
of
stickycreamy
lacing
to
follow
the
nose

yeastybready
lots
of

the
taste
is
absolutely
delicious
malty
slight
licorice
maybe
some
spices
and
lots
of

medium
body
very
smoothcreamy
brew
very
drinkable
man
what
an
awesome
doppelbock
i
thought
celebrator
was
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
this
brew
is
totally
different
in
bodycharactrer
it
could
be
the
abv
thing
though
drinkability
this
is
a
sipper
one
to
finish
the
night
while
watching
the
latter
part
of
a
baseball
game
is
a
fine
environment
for
this
beer
very
enjoyable
and
very
much
worth
its
salt
i
would
place
this
above
my
other
doppel
favorate
celebrator
the
profile
says
that
this
is
a
winter
release
but
we
picked
it
up
yesterday
in
july
so
be
sure
to
check
for
it
even
out
of
season
beer
poured
a
deep
coppery
color
with
a
half
inch
head
head
retention
faded
to
just
skimming
the
top
while
i
drank
the
beer
smelled
very
malty
with
a
smoky
scent
hints
of
coffee
and
caramel
on
my
palate
had
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
tasted
the
alcohol
but
it
was
not
overwhelming
enjoyed
this
beer
but
probably
wouldnt
want

looking

of
slight
chocolatey
malts
and
lots
of
them
very
nutty
on
the
palate
with
a
slight

on
the

end
but
not
much
light
to
medium
bodied
and
highly
drinkable
although
high
abv
could
be
a
session
brew
easily
a
nice
german
beer
by

d
nice
beer
that
is
highly
drinkable
given
its
abv
shame
its
not
available
more
readily
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
very
deep
rubycopper
color
with
a
thick
tan
creamy
looking
head
the
smell
is
primarily
sweet
with
amber
malt
there
is
a
slight
fruitiness
that
is
apparent
also
a
slightly
sweet
alcohol
characteristic
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
mostly
sweet
with
a
slight
presence
of
alcohol
a
good
slow
drinking
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
fairly
creamy
and
slightly
dry
on
the
finish
overall
this
beer
is
slightly
better
than
average
on
drinkability
because
while
it
is
a
good
sipping
beer
i
dont
think
you
would
want
to
try
to
drink
too

this
is
simply
a
fantastic
beer
more
available
than
the
ayinger
at
least
where
i
shop
and
a
little
less
expensive
its
not
a
replacement
but
its
a
very
close
second
in
my
book
update
much
later
almost
5
years
to
the
day
in
fact
i
am
very
happy
to
report
that
korbinian
is
indeed
sold
locally
and
is
my
goto
doppelbock
when
the
desire
strikes
if
i
reviewed
again
this
would
score
more
of
a
4
45
weihenstephan
can
do
no
wrong
highly
recommended
its
still
not
andechs
doppelbock
but
its
up
there
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
out
there
you
wont
regret
buying
this
one
d
very
good
somehow
this
one
had
eluded
me
up
until
now
i
would
love
to
have
it
again
a
great
doppelbock
md
i
am
beg
to
really
love
bock
beers
of
all
types
and
this
is
no
exception
this
is
a
great
beer
to
try
and
enjoy
it
has
a
nice
creamy
overall
feel
and
is
just
one
you
dont
want
to
put
down
edit
my
old
friend
boppar
told
me
that
dunkles
starkbier
means
strong
dark
beer
so
basically
its
a
german
bsda
so
basically
its
awesome
this
beer
has
been
aging
in
sams
storage
for
quite
some
time
sam
refused
to
tell
me
how
long
as
it
has
a
completely
different
label
than
the
current
version
of
korbinian
the
beer
has
a
hazy
dark
amber
color
and
is
well
carbonated
yet
despite
a
vigorous
pour
did
not
summon
forth
much
in
the
way
of
a
head
there
is
a
touch
of
a
foamy
amber
tinged
ring
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
beer
has
a
soft
well
integrated
oxidation
character
to
it
notes
of
sherry
are
definitely
evident
the
taste
takes
on
notes
of
prunes
which
are
also
noticeable
in
the
nose
as
well
as
the
beer
warms
up
a
bit
lots
of
flavors
open
up
notes
of
madeira
sherry
and
fig
become
noticeable
as
well
as
a
touch
of
chalky
dark
malt
character
in
the
finish
the
beer
also
starts
to
become
clearer
as
it
warms
this
has
aged
quite
gracefully
certainly
the
flavors
have
softened
and
melded
quite
a
bit
but
this
must
be
fairly
old
and
it
is
still
quite
drinkable
awesome
stuff
although
im
kind
of
new
to
the
style
this
is
probably
the
best
doppelbock
ive
had
so
far
it
epitomizes
the
whole
liquid
bread
description
even
more
so
than
the
salvator
i
had
yesterday
just
great
highly
recommended
the
flavour
is
rich
and
complex
with
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
and
some
roasty
stuff
going
on
too
its
all
put
together
in
a
silky
smooth
and
creamy
melange
i
really
liked
this
beer
but
its
a
bit
sweet
for
me
to
drink
a
lot
i
loved
the
fullbodied
complexity
though
a
lot
marked
1306
served
wellchilled
in
a
footed
pilsner
glass
pours
thickly
a
deep
bronze
hue
with
a
fluffy
and
dense
dark
khaki
head
bready
caramelized
aromas
predominate
with
a
subtle
spice
character
lending
an
almost
meaty
quality
to
the
scent
substantial
on
the
palate
with
a
dense
caramel
and
dark
bread
flavor
leafy
and
duskyherbal
hop
notes
come
through
near
the
back
end
the
taste
culminates
with
a
pleasant
bitterness
that
is
muted
by
the
darkbread
sweetness
mentioned
earlier
full
bodied
to
be
certain
with
a
smooth
feel
a
sharpedged
mineral
presence
in
the
water
gives
an
overall
dry
feel
to
this
otherwise
rich
and
malty
beer
wonderfully
complex
and
nearly
perfect
in
its
balance
as
fine
an
example
of
a
doppelbock
as
ive
ever
encountered
mouthfeelsmooth
but
heavy
malt
body
sweet
malt
flavors
with
the
bittersweet
chocolate
coming
through
and
finishes
somewhat
sweet
i
like
this
a
very
mild
bitterness
is
there
early
then
fades
to
other
sweet
malt
flavors
is
a
little
silkysmooth
a
good
froth
reveals
some
of
the
alcohol
for
a
warm
finish
and
earthy
hops
are
revealed
here
also
very
good
doppelbock
and
alcohol
is
wellhidden
for
8
pours
dark
with
a
tan
head
which
sticks
around
for
a
bit
not
too
much
lacing
smell
was
a
bit
off
i
think
this
bottle
had
seen
better
days
fortunately
the
flavor
was
not
affected
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
with
a
bit
of
hops
to
balance
the
flavor
dont
know
how
old
this
beer
was
but
i
suspect
it
was
a
bit
too
old
i
would
love
to
sample
this
beer
at
its
peak
even
a
little
on
the
old
side
its
a
respectable
beer
quite
drinkable
even
at
7
5
abv
the
head
pours
out
alright
but
then
leaves
behind
a
18
inch
head
covering
the
beer
on
top
so
its
not
that
bad
the
color
is
a
deep
brown
i
can
still
see
through
it
fine
but
its
very
brown
with
carbonation
bubbling
up
all
over
the
smell
is
bready
and
i
cant
smell
much
of
anything
else
the
taste
is
off
a
bit
the
sweetness
has
been
morphed
into
a
soursick
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
ok
a
little
too
carbonated
but
ok
overall
i
would
have
to
take
my
time
and
find
out
a
date
of
the
next
one
of
these
i
find
d
i
think
this
one
may
be
off
i
cant
tell
how
old
it
is
and
it
just
seems
the
metallic
is
way
to
strong
for
this
brew
also
seems
like
some
of
the
flavors
are
lacking
and
may
have
a
few
off
tastes
to
them
i
am
going
to
try
and
try
this
another
time
when
i
am
out
of
town
so
i
can
get
some
fresher
stuff
and
see
how
it
is
then
pours
a
dark
rich
amber
with
a
thick
creamy
head
smell
of
prunes
sweet
fruit
with
chocolate
flavor
of
prunes
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
burned
sugar
having
a
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
make
it
go
down
smooth
but
leaving
a
certain
metallic
bitter
aftertaste
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
someone
would
have
to
carry
me
home
but
it
might
just
be
worth
it
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
sure
knows
how
to
make
a
great
beer
just
like
their
other
styles
this
one
is
exceptional
if
only
lent
came
more
than
once
a
year
for
the
beer
only
that
is
really
a
fan
of
big
malty
beers
and
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
superb
d
perfect
rich
complex
creamy
but
oddly
light
in
the
mouth
a
nearly
perfect
dopplebock
overall
this
is
a
solid
doppelbock
there
are
some
unique
characteristics
you
dont
find
in
other
doppelbocks
unfortuanately
some
of
them
dont
add
to
the
quality
not
as
hearty
as
some
others
but
still
a
good
all
around
beer
overall
a
solid
dopplebock
with
good
malt
character
recommended
drinkability
one
of
my
favorite
dopplebocks
the
malt
is
huge
really
well
balanced
toasty
and
delicious
super
drinkable
taste
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
there
was
the
sweet
maltiness
combined
with
the
caramel
roast
and
mild
molasses
taste
however
the
body
was
rather
thin
and
carbonation
was
lacking
this
was
unlike
any
other
doppelbock
i
have
had
which
were
all
very
fullbodied
and
more
pronounced
in
malt
and
caramel
flavors
d
nice
flavor
good
balance
overall
cloying
but
not
so
much
that
its
a
turnoff
i
like
the
vanilla
aspects
and
would
enjoyed
a
heavier
dose
than
that

to

much
about

in

i
know
what
i
like
and
this
delivers
it
in

a

i
enjoyed
the

a

that
is
all
too
easy
to
more
than
sip
dont
know
that
it
has
quite
the

of
some

it
sure
is
delicious

than

and

this
doppelbock
poured
a
dark
cloudy
turbid
brown
color
with
creamy
light
brown
foam
that
persisted
a
while
and
clung
to
the
glass
a
bit
the
smell
was
dark
malty
with
light
cocoa
and
light
molasses
and
a
whiff
of
sweetness
the
taste
was
richly
malty
with
flavors
of
light
caramel
cocoa
and
a
slightly
vinous
fruitiness
there
was
a
very
light
sweetness
and
a
very
low
apparent
hoppiness
there
was
a
faint
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
full
bodied
with
moderate
but
good
carbonation
feel
the
finish
was
nicely
malty
and
this
beer
was
slightly
warming
overall
this
was
a
great
doppelbock
very
drinkable
a
solid
doppelbock
for
certain
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
worthy
of
its

recommended

a
very
drinkable
beverage
a
good
dopplebock
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
definitely
good
would
buy
drink
recomend
any
day
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
get
it
again
drinkabilty
i
gave
a
3
only
because
of
the
sweetness
and
the
abv
make
this
a
dangerous
beer
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
smooth
alcohol
becomes
noticeable
but
isnt
overwhelming
warming
and
quite
good
this
bottle
was
only
2
99
a
great
deal
in
my
opinion
overall
an
excellent
offering
very
hard
to
believe
it
is
as
strong
as
7
4
quite
quaffable
and
was
perfectly
suited
as
a
nightcap
overall
an
excellent
doppelbock
very
flavorful
and
well
crafted
the
mouth
is
great
thickened
as
it
warmed
smooth
slightly
carbonated
up
front
smoothing
through
to
end
a
very
nice
ride
taste
is
not
shy
loaded
with
caramel
some
brown
sugar
and
chocolate
toffee
perhaps
there
are
some
fruits
hiding
there
in
the
background
yum
yum
yum
i
should
go
get
a
few
more
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
dopplebocks
out
there
opinion
this
is
a
great
beer
i
have
tried
it
multiple
times
and
even
as
my
first
beer
before
but
this
is
the
maltiest
impression
that
i
have
gotten
the
bottle
was
a
bit
underfilled
when
i
opened
it
and
i
wonder
if
that
is
because
of
a
slight
oxidation
enhancing
the
malt
by
reacting
with
the
melanoidins
it
just
seems
more
dominated
by
malt
this
time
when
before
it
was
of
course
really
malty
but
drank
really
easily
this
beer
is
a
bit
earthy
but
still
really
good
in
saying
all
of
this
i
am
not
saying
that
this
beer
is
noticeably
flawed
but
it
just
tastes
a
bit
different
than
i
remember
it
in
the
past
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
one
that
i
would
drink
very
regularly
if
it
were
available
here
in
texas
sucks
for
us
texans
afflicted
by
the
tabc
overall
quite
lovely
mouthfeel
is
smoth
and
appealing
if
a
little
heavy
on
carbonation
better
as
the
beer
warms
drinkability
is
good
for
a
doppelbock
if
in
the
mood
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
at
a
sitting
celebrator
is
still
my
measuring
stick
for
doppelbocks
but
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
and
the
tight
tan
head
rose
up
to
the
top
of
the
glass
and
then
quickly
settled
down
the
body
was
dark
brown
with
a
slight
chill
haze
very
little
light
gets
through
but
what
does
is
reflected
as
ruby
the
smell
is
slightly
muted
after
some
serious
sniffs
i
get
caramel
and
some
toasty
malt
the
taste
starts
with
toasted
malt
then
some
dark
fruits
there
are
many
subtle
things
in
this
beer
the
more
i
drink
this
more
things
i
taste
there
is
a
nutty
bitterness
a
bit
of
chocolate
it
just
keeps
going
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
with
tight
carbonation
smooth
and
chewy
i
was
real
impressed
with
the
mouthfeel
i
think
it
is
perfect
the
drinkability
is
real
high
because
i
just
wanted
to
keep
drinking
it
to
find
more
flavors
excellent
drinkability
this
brew
is
very
tasty
and
highly
sipable
many
of
these
will
be
in
order
next
spring
having
a
glass
without
residue
or
some
added
carbonation
i
know
this
would
be
fine
drinking
all
night
longcomplex
yet
elegant
and
extremely
well
balanced
totally
enjoyable
beer
this
is
one
beer
i
could
drink
over
and
over
again
modest
head
mouthfeel
like
a
milkshake
on
a
hot
day
but
not
that
thick
very
easy
to
drink
smooth
finish
may
seem
prejudicial
after
a
hard
days
work
but
cant
imagine
a
finer
welcome
home
glad
i
bought
a
whole
case
this
is
a
good
dopplebock
and
quite
easy
to
drink
really
a
good
example
of
the
style
overall
hands
down
one
of
the
best
beers
in
any
category
that
ive
had
all
over
a
very
smooth
but
warming
drink
i
would
consider
this
the
ideal
afterdinner
drink
with
dessert
or
petits
fours
or
on
its
own
i
could
drink
this
a
lot
too
bad
it
is
hard
to
come
by
around
where
i
abide
d
quite
easy
to
drink
though
near
the
end
of
the
pint
i
was
satisfied
one
was
enough
a
nice
doppelbock
will
have
this
one
again
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
of
small
bubbles
that
dissipates
quickly
a
bit
hazy
typical
for
weihenstephaner
yeast
sweet
malt
aroma
no
hint
of
smoke
or
burnt
grain
hints
of
fermenting
fruit
apricots
come
to
mind
taste
is
more
fruit
apricot
and
a
hint
of
dates
yeast
character
takes
over
in
the
aftertaste
medium
to
full
body
with
a
slightly
creamy
texture
good
if
you
like
their
yeast
not
for
those
who
want
a
clean
bock
mediumbodied
with
an
alcohol
warmth
and
smooth
finish
with
low
carbonation
overall
pleasant
but
slightly
lacking
in
malt
complexity
but
still
a
very
nice
beer
with
good
balance
of
alcohol
malt
and
bitterness
cheers
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
brownred
with
a
good
sized
offwhite
head
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
toffee
chocolate
and
coffee
it
tastes
like
chocolate
nuts
toffee
raisins
and
smoked
malt
a
very
tasty
beer
the
body
of
the
beer
is
mediumfull
and
its
creamy
and
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
its
also
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
you
cant
tell
the
7
4
abv
when
youre
drinking
the
beer
but
it
hits
you
after
a
while
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
complex
flavor
without
being
overly
heavy
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
very
drinkable
it
almost
goes
down
like
a
cold
glass
of
chocolate
milk
atr
least
what
one
would
taste
like
in
a
more
beery
dimension
its
very
easy
to
drink
with
very
little
noticeable
alcohol
and
intersting
characteristics
delicious
d
another
great
beer
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
would
probably
pick
up
a
celebrator
over
it
though
all
in
all
a
pleasant
mistake
this
brew
pours
a
clear
brown
color
with
reddish
hues
the
head
is
one
finger
in
height
and
recedes
rather
quickly
into
a
thin
sheet
that
covers
the
top
of
the
liquid
the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
cream
caramel
and
butter
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
a
little
mellower
the
mouthfeel
is
exactly
what
i
like
in
a
doppelbock
mediumfull
bodied
with
an
average
level
of
carbonation
and
above
all
else
it
isnt
sticky
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
i
have
had
i
would
certainbly
buy
it
again
drinkability
definitely
tends
toward
the
heavier
more
bitter
end
of
doppelbocks
but
remains
an
exceptional
contribution
to
the
style
pushes
in
all
the
right
directions
and
remains
exceptionally
drinkable
fantastic
very
nice
deep
chestnut
color

amazingly

can

i
need
to
find
this
on
a
regular
basis
d
awesome
believe
the
hype
if
you
are
a
dopplebock
fan
very
nice
this
is
not
a
beer
you
can
be
passive
with
and
ignore
its
a
beer
that
demands
your
attention
smooth
and
rich
with
layer
upon
layer
of
flavors
begins
with
a
nice
sweetness
that
blossoms
into
a
touch
of
sherry
followed
by
a
slightly
smoky
quality
that
was
lurking
in
the
background
throughout
touches
of
chocolate
also
tingle
the
tastebuds
at
points
a
well
crafted
and
highly
enjoyable
beer
another
winner
from
weihenstephaner
pours
a
burnt
sienna
with
a
cloudy
body
that
has
a
thick
tan
head
the
nose
is
sweet
with
a
sour
funky
nutty
aroma
tough
to
make
out
other
flavors
the
taste
is
fantasic
caramel
malt
herbal
tea
tart
bitterness
the
sweetness
brings
forth
so
many
flavors
dark
fruits
raisins
plum
very
creamy
roasted
nuts
this
is
a
very
tasty
doppelbock
drinkability
all
i
can
say
is
its
great
stuff
i
would
rather
have
two
of
these
at
dinnertime
than
a
meal
gernay
may
not
have
won
the
world
cup
but
they
cant
be
genuine
losers
with
this
beer
in
the
country
its
down
to
earth
but
nicely
complex
and
it
works
along
with
a
happily
warming
abv
and
contrasting
crispness
to
render
it
refreshingly
drinkable
whether
to
celebrate
or
to
drown
ones
sorrows
this
one
makes
sure
alls
well
that
ends
well
or
even
not
too
well
for
that
matter
wow
this
is
an
intense
beer
this
is
one
of
the
few
dopples
that
dont
have
some
kind
of
erminator
names
but
actually
it
does
not
need
any
kind
of
menacing
name
since
the
beer
speaks
for
itself
amazing
beer
from
and
amazing
brewery
what
would
you
expect
get
one
and
find
out
what
a
dopplebock
should
taste
like
booya
a
great
savoring
beer
makes
for
a
nice
dessertafter
dinner
drink
thanks
to
shbobdb
for
his
unintentional
endorsement
of
this
beer
im
learning
to
review
beers
so
i
will
have
to
come
back
to
edit
this
review
drinkability
yeah
its
drinkable
this
beer
begs
another
sip
just
to
try
to
identify
all
of
the
fantastic
flavours
that
are
hidden
in
the
malt
profile
a
really
nice
beer
d
ive
been
looking
foward
to
trying
this
ever
since
trying
weihenstephaners
weissbiers
big
disapointment
being
a
textural
person
the
mouthfeel
was
a
huge
turnoff
and
the
rest
of
the
beers
traits
were
less
than
impressive
as
well
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
something
to
give
thanks
for
just
as
i
expected
this
is
nowhere
near
as
malty
sweet
as
some
others
probably
the
most
bitter
doppelbock
ive
tasted
its
nicely
balanced
and
has
a
lot
of
flavor
but
it
doesnt
have
as
much
character
as
say
ayinger
celebrator
it
is
however
incredibly
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
buy
this
if
you
see
it
i
will
definitely
get
it
again
d
high
easy
to
down
and
nice
on
the
palate
drinkability
what
a
fantastic
beer
super
drinkable
considering
the
7
4
abv
big
sweet
malts
with
almost
no
hint
of
hops
in
this
delicious
dopplebock
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
in
the
flavor
profile
however
you
can
feel
a
warming
of
the
face
as
this
one
goes
down
a
must
try
beer
regardless
of
style
as
a
self
proclaimed
hop
head
i
find
korbinian
a
great
change
of
pace
and
one
all
must
seek
and
try
at
least
once
i
know
that
i
will
revisit
this
one
again
a
very
drinkable
beer
alcohol
is
nearly
not
perceivable
and
is
so
tastey
that
you
just
keep
tipping
it
back
not
exactly
like
most
dopplebocks
ive
tried
but
a
truly
great
beer
thouroughly
enjoyed
sipping
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
one
finger
head
into
a
pilsner
glass
smell
is
a
pleasant
sweet
malt
with
a
bit
of
fruit
and
chocolate
taste
is
just
perfect
for
the
style
a
nice
sweet
malty
taste
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
somewhat
strong
alcohol
presence
the
taste
is
very
dry
with
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
the
drinkability
is
exceptionally
high
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
overall
a
superb
beer
that
is
a
must
try
one
of
my
favorites
a
must
try
mk
the
burniness
takes
the
drinkability
down
a
peg
but
overall
this
is
a
good
dbock
overall
just
a
tad
above
the
bland
mark
the
beer
is
just
too
weak
i
drank
it
both
cold
straight
out
the
fridge
and
warm
the
flavor
has
plenty
of
potential
but
i
had
to
drink
the
entire
16
9
oz
to
really
get
a
grasp
on
its
taste
nothing
special
here
high
drinkability
because
of
the
ease
at
which
the
abv
goes
down
the
mouthfeel
could
use
some
adjusting
but
i
could
see
downing
endless
litres
of
this
in
a
bavarian
bierhall
overall
this
is
an
eminently
drinkable
beer
it
is
impressively
complex
and
wellbalanced
fullbodied
but
sweet
easy
to
sip
and
enjoy
one
or
have
several
score
one
for
the
germans
pours
a
murky
dark

massive

smells
of

and
some
dark

taste
is
heavy
on
the
malts
very
sweet
and
caramel
with
a
mild
honey
and
fruit
finish
cherries
maybe
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
but
a
bit
too
much
so
drinkable
for
the
right
occasion
but
not
for
any
and
every
occasion
dessert
beer
this
beer
poured
with
a
thick
head
that
dissapeared
quickly
the
color
os
a
mahogany
hue
the
smell
is
caramel
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
like
honey
and
malts
there
is
a
alcohol
presence
in
the
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
is
good
for
the
style
i
may
buy
a
bomber
of
this
again
sometime
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
full

the
beer
has
no
trace
of

or

the
beer
is
well
balanced
the
beer
is
highly
quaffable
this
is
a
gift
from
all
the
beer
gods
i
think
i
may
have
just
had
a
religious
experience
drinkability
the
abv
hurts
the
drinkability
a
bit
despite
that
the
bock
is
smooth
and
clean
nice
strong
sweet
and
malty
ill
get
it
again
the
body
is
thick
and
heavy
but
not
sticky
in
anyway
with
more
raisins
figs
caramel
and
toffee
coming
through
i
am
actually
very
amazed
at
how
balanced
this
beer
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
but
still
very
good
i
am
truley
amazed
at
how
the
germans
make
these
simple
beers
so
complex
very
well
done
dark
dark
dark
color
is
wonderfully
caramel
brown
with

oh
my
taste
is
dominating
spicy
biting
strong
and
full
this
is
like
a
weizenbock
on
steroids
just
an
awesome
and
unique
brew
this
brew
is
easily
among
the
finest
doppelbocks
in
the
world
it
could
be
the
best
but
its
certainly
no
worse
than
3rd
overall
a
tasty
complex
doppelbock
and
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
not
the
best
weihenstephaner
brew
but
still
a
very
good
one
mouthfeeldrinkability
milky
and
so
eloquently
carbonated
that
it
serves
the
beer
just
right
it
is
all
about
the
flavors
here
and
the
presentation
in
the
mouth
showcases
them
without
distraction
after
every
swallow
an
uncontrollable
mmm
makes
its
way
from
my
lips
what
a
treat
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
again
highly
highly
recommended
bringing
up
the
rear
would
be
hackerpschorr
animator
followed
by
the
few
other
smaller
breweries
ive
tried
verdict
sit
back
and
let
this
beer
take
you
to
a
very
happy
place
a
benchmark
doppelbock
for
sure
drinkability
the
perfect
storm
here
incredible
flavor
managable
abv
great
price
simply
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
usually
too
busy
drinking
it
to
review
it
fantastic
beer
very
dark
brown
toffee
dark
malty
aroma
with
some
fruits
added
in
the
taste
is
very
rich
and
complex
while
remaining
a
surprisingly
drinkable
beer
i
had
no
problem
downing
the
whole
bottle
by
myself
in
no
time
at
all
really
has
staple
dopplebock
characteristics
with
the
thick
malt
character
and
hints
of
fruit
but
the
drinkability
of
this
separates
it
from
most
others
a
really
good
offering
from
weihenstephaner
and
something
to
enjoy
for
the
winter
season
the
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
transparent
brown
with
about
a
one
inch
tan
head
i
found
the
beer
had
a
faint
malt
aroma
with
some
fuit
undertones
the
head
stayed
through
out
the
whole
glass
the
mouthfeel
was
consistant
there
is
some
alcohol
present
in
the
taste
but
it
is
quite
smooth
and
very
drinkable
there
was
a
nice
lace
through
most
of
the
glass
i
will
be
trying
some
of
the
other
dopplebocks
soon
mouthfeel
is
creamy
medium
bodied
and
chewy
with
a
mellow
carbonation
a
meal
in
a
glass
for
sure
id
take
this
over
a
loaf
of
bread
anyday
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
it
will
be
what
i
turn
to
when
im
craving
a
dopplebock
this
one
is
not
to
be
missed
i
believe
i
paid
1
99
for
this
bottle
which
is
a
freakin
steal
for
how
good
it
is

this
one

this
brew
has
a
good

but
the
aroma
turned
me
off
a
bit
and
dopplebocks
are
not
my
favorite
style
doesnt
quite
stack
up
to
the
celebrator
in
my
opinion
but
good
for
the
style

of
the

with
only
a
slight
suggestion
of
alcohol
showing
through
this
is
an
excellent
beer
with
perfect
drinkability
almost
too
easy
to
drink
considering
the
alcohol
content
i
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
this

not
something
that
i
would
want
often
or
much
of
a
nice
meal
of
chocolatenougat
fudge
so
pleasant
and
welcoming
with
a
nice
soft
complexity
throughout
very
nice
a
strong
yet
very
relaxing
and
enjoyable
doppelbock
great
example
of
the
style
from
a
brewery
that
seems
to
do
that
a
lot
highly
recommended
as
a
double
bock
fan
this
is
simply
one
of
the
best
of
its
kind
the
color
is
a
dark
amber
that
is
extremley
sharp
with
a
white
creamy
head
the
smell
is
loaded
with
malt
chocolate
raisins
and
other
fruity
goodness
the
taste
begins
as
slightly
bitter
but
quickly
is
overtaken
by
a
sweetness
explosion
that
lingers
on
the
palate
goes
down
so
smooth
and
would
be
great
with
a
a
chocolate
or
fruit
desert
this
is
my
kind
of
beer
and
would
gladly
pay
another
2
59
for
a
16
9
oz
bottle
look
out
ayinger
celebrator
you
have
company
very
tasty
i
would
prefer
the
salvator
over
this
stronger
coffee
tones
but
i
wouldnt
kick
this
bitch
out
of
bed
either
me
likey
pours
out
a
dark
brown
brew
that
shows
ruby
light
through
it
smells
of
a
bit
yeastylicorice
but
very
mild
scents
has
2
finger
head
that
seems
to
quickly
disappear
to
a
light
bubble
layer
taste
of
sweet
malt
that
seems
to
end
dryvery
mild
hop
taste
and
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
breath
as
the
beer
warms
it
becomes
sweeter
mouthfeel
is
oka
bit
thin
drinkabilityhmmm
not
bad
possibly
dopplebocks
arent
my
style
ill
search
out
a
few
more
and
see
if
its
true
a
nice
after
dinner
beer
nice
head
on
top
of
the
redbrown
beer
drank
it
out
of
my
celebrator
glass
and
it
has
now
claimed
it
i
think
this
bets
out
celebrator
in
my
book
nice
clean
sweet
malt
smell
deep
flavors
of
complex
chain
of
long
boil
sugars
with
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
amazing
body
and
texture
between
beer
and
syrup
very
drinkable
i
am
glad
i
had
two
to
drink
because
one
wasnt
enough
poured
to
a
generous
head
with
lots
of
carbonation
the
bottle
looked
as
busy
as
an
anthill
with
the
bubbles
racing
here
and
there
it
smells
sweet
like
sweet
plums
and
raisins
the
taste
is
sweet
as
well
all
i
can
think
of
are
more
plums
and
very
sweet
prunes
luscious
creamy
mouthfeel
probably
my
favorite
dopplebock
this
is
a
very
nice
dark
brown
beer
with
a
huge
tan
head
it
has
a
strong
raisinprune
smell
and
a
bit
of
a
spicy
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
very
nice
it
has
a
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
caramel
flavor
with
prunes
and
chocolate
there
is
really
no
bitterness
to
it
at
all
just
a
bit
of
a
spicy
aftertaste
it
is
extremely
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
all
in
all
from
the
husband
of
a
wine
drinker
if
she
likes
it
it
must
be
good
quite
nice
it
definitely
deserves
praise
pretty
drinkable
for
a
7
4
brew
like
i
said
very
smooth
very
inoffensive
just
i
dunno
i
was
expecting
more
it
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
tall
dense
tan
head
aroma
is
rich
with
caramel
raisins
bread
and
slight
roasty
undercurrents
the
palate
is
doubly
as
rich
as
the
nose
with
the
perfect
amount
of
clean
bitterness
to
cut
through
the
maltiness
a
truly
wondeful
beer
not
a
misstep
along
the
way
to
the
lengthy
roasty
finish
the
taste
and
smell
of
this
are
incredible
i
dont
give
out
5s
but
this
one
is
as
close
to
a
5
as
ive
had
this
is
a
must
try
highly
recommended
dthis
beer
has
a
great
appearance
and
a
complex
rich
smell
so
i
was
expecting
the
same
from
the
taste
this
was
not
the
case
a
little
light
in
taste
complexity
and
the
mouthfeel
was
watery
to
boot
quite
nice
really
easily
worth
a
revisit
shame
i
never
found
this
in
germany
still
a
dang
tasty
dopplebock
color
is
deep
red
low
head
retention
and
some
light
carbonation
smells
malty
and
astringent
with
some
stewed
fruits
flavor
is
malty
with
a
sweet
start
and
an
astringent
finish
palate
is
surprisingly
light
for
such
a
high
gravity
beer
man
i
guess
i
am
jaded
but
this
just
seems
to
be
variations
on
the
same
theme
a
good
beer
but
did
not
knock
my
socks
off
drinkability
very
smooth
drinking
a
super
dopplebock
and
i
am
glad
i
picked
it
up
sweet
caramel
malts
in
the
taste
as
well
but
its
got
an
oddly
empty
aftertaste
much
weaker
flavor
than
id
expect
from
a
doppelbock
very
light
carbonation
and
a
mediumlight
mouthfeel
very
dark
with
beautiful
ruby
highlights
fine
tan
head
with
low
carbonation
apparent
from
the
pour
nice
lacing
that
continues
throughout
rich
malty
aroma
with
toffee
and
plum
toffee
and
caramel
form
a
base
malty
flavour
and
theres
a
bit
of
chocolate
layered
on
top
cherries
and
hop
flavour
towards
the
end
light
warming
alcohol
is
barely
evident
towards
the
end
as
well
particularly
as
it
warms
a
bit
light
hop
bitterness
with
a
bit
of
metallic
character
lingers
for
a
short
while
in
the
finish
followed
by
the
delicate
remnants
of
the
malt
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
slightly
grainy
texture
very
enjoyable
and
something
ill
pick
up
again
drinkability
an
excellent
affordable
dopplebock
and
definitely
wouldnt
mind
having
another
right
now

no

the

and
has
a
small
offwhite
head
that
reduces
to
a
collar
and
leaves
little

it
smells
of
banana

lots
of

that

cloying
and
maybe
some

all
on
top
of
a
medium
body
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
too
much
to
make
it
very
drinkable
which
happens
to
me
fairly
often
when
i
drink
dopples
beer
pours
darker
than
night
with
a
nice
head
do
you
like
coffee
if
you
do
take
your
time
in
the
rich
aroma
of
this
beer
sweet
and
malty
alcohol
very
well
hidden
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
beer
to
relax
to
but
one
is
enough
in
a
night
for
me
sure
i
might
enjoy
another
beer
every
nowandagain
but
baby
i
didnt
mean
it
youre
better
than
all
those
beers
really
baby
i
mean
it
gimme
another
chance
dont
go
away
i
know
the
weather
will
get
warmer
soon
and
youll
leave
me
for
a
time
dont
leave
me
baby
please
i
didnt
mean
it
dont
leave
me
dont
leave
me
lots
of
good
flavors
go
on
in
here
but
ultimately
its
far
too
sweet
for
me
to
want
another
serving
still
i
can
see
having
this
with
dessert
now
and
then
pours
a
dark
garnet
with
amber
highlights
below
a
finger
of
khaki
bubbles
nose
is
thick
with
grainy
maltiness
some
earthy
peat
and
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
taste
is
rested
upon
a
hearty
sweet
caramel
malt
backbone
some
alcohol
soaked
woody
notes
and
a
bit
of
baltic
prune
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
oily
with
moderate

this
is
a
solid
flavorful
authentictasting
german
dopplebock
didnt
blow
me
away
but
certainly
solid
and
wellconstructed
one
of
the
better
dopplebocks
out
there
a
delicious
beer
if
you
love
malt
because
this
beer
is
full
of
it
complex
nutty
pecans
walnuts
fruity
overripe
peaches
dates
figs
maple
syrup
and
brown
sugar
flavors
swirl
over
the
palate
with
a
heavy
coating
light
hop
bittering
offers
a
light
balance
but
not
flavor
or
aroma
the
beer
remains
toasty
and
lightly
roasted
from
sip
to
swallow
very
mellow
and
smooth
as
it
goes
down
with
a
bold
roasty
syrup
aftertaste
a
joy
to
drink
on
seeing
this
beer
in
a
glass
i
first
thought
that
came
to
my
mind
was
a
beautiful
brunet
with
red
highlights
pours
a
tall
tan
head
that
fades
this
beer
just
looks
good
smells
like
rye
whiskey
with
some
lemons
and
a
bit
of
chalk
on
the
center
of
the
tongue
it
tastes
like
caramel
and
peaches
ant
fades
to
citrus
on
the
edge
of
the
tongue
the
flavors
compliment
each
other
well
the
bodys
light
and
creamy
with
a
fine
carbonation
i
think
this
would
go
well
with
roast
beef
22
ounce
bottle
this
beer
pours
out
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
huge
with
dough
brown
sugar
apple
cider
and
caramel
doughy
malt
flavor
that
somehow
manages
to
be
incredibly
strong
without
being
cloyingly
sweet
i
think
it
is
this
fact
that
seperates
the
korbinian
from
other
hugely
malty
dopplebocks
there
is
some
dark
fruit
flavor
too
the
finish
is
spicy
thick
chewy
mouthfeel
much
more
drinkable
than
you
would
think
i
first
had
this
beer
when
i
was
new
to
craft
beer
and
i
wasnt
impressed
that
first
time
revisiting
this
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
weihenstephaner
is
now
probably
my
favorite
german
brewery
a
good
german
doppelbock
poured
out
to
a
dark
cherry
brown
color
with
a
18
inch
head
and
some
minor
lacing
in
the
glass
aromas
of
smokey
aged
cheeses
bread
dark
fruits
and
some
earth
taste
was
along
the
same
lines
as
the
smell
with
more
complexity
flavors
of
bready
malts
mild
smoke
wood
a
touch
of
cheese
and
some
grain
you
have
to
really
look
for
all
the
flavors
but
they
are
there
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
mildly
rich
a
good
level
of
drinkability
for
less
than
3
dollars
a
bottle
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
highly
recommended
i
will
be
looking
for
a
case
of
this
soon
if
it
werent
for
the
abv
you
could
drink
a
dozen
wow
wow
wow
wow
wow
wow
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
makes
you
have
a
new
favorite
style
this
dopplebock
is
fantastic
on
all
angles
it
pours
out
a
deep
plum
brown
with
a
phenomenal
red
glow
that
just
looks
magical
the
head
is
fluffy
white
and
sticky
enough
to
leave
residue
the
aroma
is
bold
and
has
a
semistrong
alcohol
sweetness
to
it
there
is
definately
a
presence
of
aroma
hops
that
pull
through
the
taste
is
wonderfully
sweet
but
prefectly
balanced
out
with
some
hop
bitterness
the
mollases
body
is
full
but
heavy
the
caramel
and
raison
flavors
coat
the
entire
mouth
and
the
alcohol
sharpness
leaves
a
little
warmth
and
burning
this
is
very
drinkable
and
goes
down
remarkably
smooth
the
7
4
abv
is
very
well
hidden
in
the
taste
but
it
is
present
enough
to
warm
your
body
on
a
cold
night
absolutely
awesome
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
body
with
tan
coloured
head
and
minimal
lacing
not
much
retention
either
aroma
of
caramel
sweet
malt
alcohol
and
dark
fruit
taste
is
very
sweet
prunelike
molasses
caramel
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
chewy
and
thick
lots
of
malty
sweetness
strong
bold
and
flavourful
overall
this
could
be
your
favorite
doppel
or
not
really
its
not
really
my
favorite
doppelbock
the
grainy
and
pruney
plum
flavors
are
a
little
much
for
me
quite
good
otherwise
listed
as
a
doppelbock
and
based
on
that
i
have
to
knock
it
down
a
bit
as
a
traditional
bock
id
probably
put
it
about
a
4
5
weihenstephaner
is
a
top
5
brewery
for
me
this
beer
adds
to
their
legacy
im
being
a
bit
picky
but
this
beer
would
be
even
better
with
more
bitterness
not
too
much
but
more
however
i
dont
have
any
issues
coming
back
to
this
beer
when
i
see
it
about
goes
well
in
the
snifter
to
finish
off
the
evening
along
with
that
the
price
is
as
good
as
youll
find
for
a
beer
of
this
volume
and
quality
definately
worth
the
price
of
admission
slàinte
smells
great
while
drinking
the
only
downside
for
me
is
the
initial
unbalance
of
acidic
taste
and
probably
not
enough
bitterness
to
match
i
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
based
on
the
labelling
but
turns
out
this
is
a
pretty
good
doppelbock
dark
chestnut
color
with
a
medium
thick
tan
head
thin
stringy
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
malty
and
bready
mediumbodied
and
smooth
with
a
nice
smoky
malt
flavor
sweet
caramel
and
light
hops
balance
well
together
the
finish
is
mildly
bitter
and
roasty
all
in
all
an
above
average
doppelbock
smooth
rich
medium
bodied
and
slightly
chewy
this
is
a
damned
good
beer
murky
brown
with
a
decent
inch
head
sweet
caramel
malts
chocolate
and
some
alcohol
notes
on
the
nose
thick
chewy
malts
with
hints
of
caramel
toffee
and
dark
roasted
coffee
beans
dare
i
say
a
bit
of
dark
rum
or
kahlua
like
flavors

why
not
kisses
of
hops
and
pepper
what
a
whopper
of
a
double
enjoy
beer
is
good
happy
doppelbock
beering
i
knew
about
this
beers
reputation
but
i
didnt
expect
what
i
found
today
simply
put
its
an
amazingly
delicious
doppelbock
that
has
to
be
considered
among
the
worlds
best
brauerei
weihenstephan
brews
some
pretty
remarkable
stuff
but
korbinian
is
their
supreme
creation
and
is
an
absolute
must
try
for
anyone
who
fancies
himself
a
lover
and
appreciator
of
world
class
beer
this
is
a
great
doppel
i
wish
it
was
available
in
spokane
guess
ill
have
to
head
back
to
get
some
more
must
go
get
me
some
more
i
really
reccommend
this
beer
try
some
if
you
get
the
chance
the
taste
starts
malty
sweet
with
potent
caramel
some
toffee
and
a
rising
sweet
chocolate
caramel
stands
predominant
throughout
and
aptly
serves
as
a
base
that
ties
together
the
costarring
flavors
to
flesh
out
the
story
other
early
flavors
i
get
are
iron
and
pumpkin
alcohol
doesnt
make
an
appearance
until
during
the
swallow
and
makes
its
strongest
presence
known
in
the
aftertaste
another
part
of
the
aftertaste
is
a
dry
grassy
hop
flatness
it
stands
in
contrast
to
the
overall
sweet
malty
theme
and
isnt
particularly
alluring
a
resurgence
of
chocolate
offers
reinforcement
to
the
malt
sweet
to
make
for
an
interesting
battle
body
is
medium
but
there
is
a
smooth
creamy
thickness
good
thing
for
these
thick
qualities
as
they
hold
the
malt
sweet
on
the
tongue
during
the
aftertaste
to
tip
the
scale
carbonation
is
moderate
perhaps
working
with
the
grassy
and
alcohol
in
the
form
of
an
acid
sting
during
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
filling
beer
and
it
also
kicked
my
ass
wheres
my
pillow
its
time
for
bed
knockout
dark
translucent
beauty
with
a
firm
faintly
brown
head
wonderfully
carbonated
and
the
nose
is
heavily
malted
dark
fruits
and
spices
taste
started
with
an
anise
flavor
that
changed
to
a
pleasant
malt
and
fruit
flavor
as
the
beer
warmed
mouthfeel
is
full
chewy
and
the
finish
is
long
lasting
the
beer
might
be
a
little
fruity
for
heavy
consumption
but
one
large
bottle
is
a
real
treat
awesome
i
cant
believe
this
is
the
first
time
i
had
this
one
i
had
this
one
as
a
nice
after
dinner
tipple
at
the
mesquito
grill
in
doyelstown
pa
this
was
about
5
for
the
bottle
not
bad
at
all
i
thought
to
myself
anyways
this
one
is
a
nearly
opaque
dark
brownblack
colour
with
ruby
edges
head
is
tannish
brown
and
lasts
well
and
leaves
nice
lacing
aromas
are
all
dark
fruits
and
figs
with
super
bready
bavarian
pretzel
malts
to
style
this
one
is
pretty
damn
low
on
the
german
hops
but
thats
how
its
supposed
to
be
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
complex
dark
fruit
flavors
like
plum
and
fig
roasted
nuts
also
come
into
the
picture
as

variaties

a

thing
for
a
doppel
drinkability
is
nice
as
well
good
stuff
d
the
easiest
drinking
dopplebock
i
have
had
but
is
this
really
a
dopplebock
very
drinkable
i
will
stock
up
next
chance
i
get
rich
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
a
light
colored
head
delicious
malty
nose
like
walking
into
a
bakery
the
taste
is
an
overwhelming
malt
flavor
perhaps
a
little
bit
chocolatey
extremely
easy
drinking
this
went
down
very
well
paired
with
a
steak
right
of
the
grill
probably
the
best
beer
from
weihenstephaner
ive
tried
so
far
even
more
than
their
legendary
hefeweizen
wow
what
a
delicious
doppelbock
this
one
rivals
all
the
best
ones
that
ive
had
including
the
ayinger
celebrator
very
dark
brown
pour
with
a
small
head
that
had
trouble
keeping
its
retention
fantastic
aroma
and
taste
loads
of
caramel
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
coffee
delicious
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
from
the
hops
medium
bodied
for
a
doppelbock
but
it
goes
down
so
smoothly
i
wanted
another
one
but
had
to
hold
myself
back
so
i
could
drive
home
stupid
cars
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
1
of
light

over
the
clear
burgundy
amber
brew
head
hangs
around
like
nobodys

and

lasting
aroma
is
chocolate
grain

taste
is
creamy
dark
malts
with
a
light
fruity
tint
to
it
and
a
grain
husk
aftertaste
that
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
excellent
alcohol
is
hidden
dangerously
leaving
a
brew
that
goes
down
easy
and
quick

drinkability
very
tasty
very
drinkable
looking
forward
to
real
dopplebock
weather
a
delicious
brew
that
i
could
drink
all
night
despite
the

heady
minimal

hazelnut

and
darkasnight

taste
brings
out
the
best
of
the
aroma
without
expected
bitterness
some
mild
hop
notes
plum
and
clove
drop
by
for
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
crisp
lagery
aftertaste
good
and
drinkable
in
its
fluffiness
however
this
watery
body
is
unexpected
and
consciously
disappointing
for
the
style
ill
have
no
problem
finishing
it
though
bitterness
evolves
as
i
continue
to
drink
a
hitormiss
brewery
offering
something
that
falls
in
the
middle
of
their
lineup
good
beer
pours
an
amazing
dark
ruby
red
sometimes
brown
sometimes
red
really
interesting
topped
off
by
a
big
fluffy
white
head
i
need
to
wait
for
it
to
subside
before
finishing
the
pour
smells
like
sweet
malts
a
bit
of
bready
yeast
a
hint
of
fruits
taste
is
quite
sweet
very
strong
malt
backbone
some
bitterness
at
the
end
slight
iron
taste
like
blood
but
still
quite
pleasant
dark
cherries
in
the
middle
and
little
bit
of
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
middle
rather
low
carbonation
in
the
mouthful
creamy
and
smooth
somewhat
disappointed
with
this
one
i
think
it
would
be
a
lot
better
its
no
where
near
the
quality
of
celebrator
doppelbock
a
fantastic
beer
unique
and
very
tasty
a
very
dark
brown
beer
with
some
good
mahogony
highlights
has
a
big
foamy
beige
head
there
is
a
nice
sweet
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
fig
and
coffee
a
solid
sweet
malt
lays
down
on
the
front
of
your
tongue
with
some
dried
fruit
and
chocolate
notes
a
good
roasted
malt
bitterness
balances
the
sweet
start
on
the
finish
a
tasty
treat
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
to
room
temp
pours
a
beautiful
dark
red
with
a
very
aggressive
head
that
is
thick
and
creamy
aroma
is
a
little
disappointing
a
bit
of
sweetness
caramelized
malt
and
denim
but
not
much
of
those
flavors
of
lightly
burnt
toffee
malt
coffee
mostly
pleasantly
bitter
flavors
slightly
metallic
finish
but
not
enough
to
be
offputting
mouthfeel
is
creamy
at
first
quickly
becoming
thin
and
acidic
not
especially
drinkable
but
worthy
of
a
try
does
not
measure
up
to
weihenstephaners
other
offerings
big
malt
in
the
mouth
caramel
and
peppery
spice
lots
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
and
some
hops
in
the
finish
mouth
is
lightly
sticky
and
the
malty
alcohol
taste
lingers
not
too
drinkable
and
not
too
smooth
not
a
great
beer
quite
frankly
drinkability
this
one
was
a
very
good
doppelbock
but
i
still
enjoyed
the
weltenberger
and
the
celebrator
a
bit
more
its
still
a
very
good
doppelbock
and
worth
whatever
i
paid
for
it
would
recommend
highly
pour
beautiful
cloudy
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
creamy
head
two
fingers
tall
light
tan
microbubbles
with
a
mooncrater
top
leaves
a
large
and
intricate
cobweb
lacing
on
the
glass
instant
aroma
of
dark
fruits
raisins
and
figs
a
sweet
prune
and
molasses
taste
toasty
malts
yeasty
with
a
more
hoppy
finish
one
downside
is
the
alcohol
that
comes
out
in
the
end
nicely
chewy
a
slow
sipper
probably
too
sweet
to
have
another
but
terrific
as
a
standalone
heavy
and
full
mouthfeel
this
is
a
really
great
beer
ive
been
looking
forward
to
this
one
since
ive
gotten
on
a
doppelbock
kick
appears
a
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
minimal
lacing
was
left
on
the
glass
roasty
malts
and
a
big
caramel
sweetness
start
the
aroma
off
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
is
lingering
underneath
sweet
chocolate
and
caramel
flavors
up
front
some
roastiness
in
the
mix
as
well
finishes
with
a
lingering
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
solid
with
a
creamy
texture
easy
drinking
stuff
but
not
as
complex
as
i
was
hoping
for
seemed
a
bit
too
sweet
to
though
drinkability
this
was
very
good
i
really
like
weihenstephaner
products
it
was
fairly
high
in
abv
but
quite
drinkable
i
could
definitely
have
another
but
not
really
a
session
beer
just
good
sippin
i
would
have
this
again
although
their
dunkel
weiss
is
my
favorite
cheers
flavors
are
simple
straightforward
dopplebock
rich
creamy
malt
backbone
caramel
chocolate
slightly
sweet
coffee
rich
cigar
tobacco
and
real
chocolate
flavors
there
are
just
enough
hops
to
keep
it
from
being
cloying
after
the
beer
goes
down
the
hops
are
more
pronounced
offering
a
nice
dry
finish
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
having
more
thanks
to
terry
at
mountview
who
cam
through
with
a
casewof
this
after
i
requested
it
based
upon
stonecrushers
reviews
poured
a
nice
dark
caramel
brown
color
with
amber
highlights
fairly
aggressive
pour
led
to
a
nice
whipped
two
finger
tan
head
which
slowly
bubbled
its
way
down
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
with
hints
of
caramel
and
clove
spiciness
over
a
sweet
bread
body
im
new
to
dopplebocks
so
im
not
used
to
their
aroma
profile
yet
so
it
is
hard
to
pick
out
the
subtleties
but
this
one
sure
does
smell
nice
initially
cold
im
not
impressed
with
much
flavor
im
going
to
let
this
one
sit
for
a
bit
to
warm15
minutes
passafter
warming
a
bit
the
subtle
flavors
start
to
present
themselves
there
is
a
pretty
huge
malt
presence
just
as
i
expected
but
it
is
balanced
well
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
at
the
end
the
malts
dont
present
themselves
as
overly
sweet
in
this
beer
as
i
was
expecting
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
and
creamy
to
some
extent
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
could
easily
sit
down
with
and
have
a
couple
drinkability
is
very
good
a
nice
spicey
dopplebock
glad
my
local
store
got
some
in
this
year
which
means
they
will
have
it
next
year
i
hope
pouring
a
chestnut
color
with
1
finger
thick
of
white
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
to
a
slight
surface
layer
with
minimal
cling
this
one
is
not
much
to
look
at
really
however
aromas
are
of
brown
toffee
and
hops
with
some
decent
maltiness
a
slight
hops
aroma
as
well
deep
down
this
has
a
chocolate
tone
as
well
on
the
nose
taste
is
of
sweet
toffee
up
front
with
a
slight
clove
flavor
spice
and
some
grainy
malts
slight
hops
on
the
finish
as
well
with
some
yeast
flavors
carbonation
is
moderate
that
accompanies
a
mediumfull
body
a
little
chewy
with
a
great
smooth
finish
along
with
a
tinge
of
alcohol
easy
to
enjoy
this
one
interesting
tasty
and
smooth
purchased
in
a
500
ml
brown
bottle
without
a
freshness
date
korbinian
poured
out
darker
than
anticipated
chestnut
red
and
had
a
bouquet
of
roasted
nuts
dried
cherries
and
grassy
noble
hops
the
taste
was
mellow
and
roasty
with
the
malts
dominant
just
as
they
should
have
been
dark
skinned
sweet
fruits
rolled
around
on
the
tongue
and
were
backed
by
a
smoky
woody
and
herbal
hop
bitterness
alcohol
was
warm
but
was
hidden
well
enough
to
not
be
detracting
from
drinkability
aftertaste
was
full
and
long
drawn
out
a
satisfyingly
meaty
german
import
suited
well
to
usher
in
the
first
day
of
spring
the
scent
is
the
first
thing
you
will
notice
about
this
guy
sweet
sweet
malts
caramel
toffee
even
bits
of
chocolate
this
all
comes
out
of
a
black
bodied
brown
hued
brew
fairsized
cream
head
good
retention
full
dose
of
thick
chewy
malts
caramel
to
chocolate
some
bitterness
taste
lastes
long
after
the
brew
is
down
alcohol
stops
in
to
say
hello
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
but
isnt
obnoxious
about
it
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
fairly
dry
finish
well
worth
my
2
49
this
really
is
a
tremendous
brew
consistent
year
after
year
after
year
the
malts
and
light
molasses
flavors
are
raw
but
the
mouthfeel
incredibly
smooth
well
done
as
usually
by
this
magnificent
brewery
i
am
amazed
at
the
complexity
of
this
beer
with
all
the
flavors
not
one
of
them
over
powers
the
others
and
they
all
seem
to
get
along
in
almost
perfect
harmony
the
only
downside
i
see
in
this
beer
is
that
it
is
a
little
bit
heavy
and
i
really
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
but
what
a
night
it
would
be
the
taste
is
what
makes
this
beer
stand
out
from
the
crowd
it
was
like
a
liquid
heath
bar
toffee
and
chocolate
are
close
to
overwhelming
but
its
not
cloying
or
too
sweet
near
perfect
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
that
it
makes
this
beer
very
dangerous
drink
more
than
one
and
youll
feel
it
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
wellretained
head
wow
the
nose
is
really
complex
sweet
malt
with
lots
of
raisin
and
grape
scents
but
also
a
distinct
prune
smell
throughout
flavor
is
extremely
malty
with
the
same
prune
flavors
coupled
with
caramel
chocolate
and
just
a
little
smoky
note
toasty
bread
flavors
are
also
in
there
each
sip
is
so
soft
and
chewy
with
complexity
though
that
you
could
search
through
there
and
find
most
anything
you
were
looking
for
i
think
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
finish
but
only
lightly
overall
very
nice
drinkabilitycomments
despite
the
relatively
high
alcohol
content
this
goes
down
so
easily
and
tastes
so
delicious
that
i
can
have
several
in
a
sitting
fantastic
this
beer
solidifies
weihenstephans
standing
as
one
of
the
worlds
truly
great
breweries
the
hefeweizen
brought
this
notion
to
mind
and
korbinian
proves
it
this
brew
is
a
dark
but
clear
brown
with
a
light
brown
head
the
head
is
bulbous
rocky
and
solid
through
most
of
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
serious
and
intense
chocolate
character
this
beer
simply
smells
sweeta
mix
of
big
malt
flavors
not
unlike
dry
dark
malt
extract
with
unsweetened
chocolate
plums
cherries
and
sugar
creeping
into
the
back
of
the
aroma
is
an
alcohol
smell
the
first
taste
is
sweet
and
softits
smooth
full
of
body
and
very
creamy
its
not
so
sweet
that
it
becomes
undrinkable
but
its
still
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
i
could
drink
all
night
nice
warming
by
the
middle
of
the
glass
finish
has
a
little
hops
but
also
a
powerful
lingering
maltiness
this
is
solid
enjoyable
and
worth
pensively
long
slow
sips
sampled
as
part
of
a
blind
dopplebock
tasting
this
one
poured
a
deep
brown
with
an
attractive
frothy
dark
tan
head
pleasant
aroma
of
brown
sugar
deeply
toasted
caramel
burgundy
cherry
hazelnut
semiroasted
wellrounded
flavors
of
chocolate
sweet
cherry
plum
and
toasted
malt
fairly
sweet
throughout
with
hints
of
both
grapes
and
noble
hops
beneath
the
blanket
of
deep
chewy
malt
medium
to
full
bodied
syrupy
in
the
mouth
overall
exceptionally
sweet
rich
enjoyable
porter
like
colour
and
even
taste
and
aroma
some
malts
chocolate
and
cherries
and
berries
raisins
and
currents
hops
smoothness
from
malts
yet
sour
finish
bit
high
on
the
alcohol
though
disguised
thanks
whoever
brought
this
to
doug
shoemakers
party
drinkability
a
stunningly
well
made
doppelbock
not
as
sweet
as
some
of
the
others
nicely
rounded
this
beer
is
a
malt
monster
malt
soup
multiple
decoctions
up
the
wazoo
flavor
is
alcoholic
with
intense
biscuit
sweetness
and
a
slight
hoppyness
in
the
finish
the
flavor
notes
are
simple
but
intense
and
malty
sweet
would
be
a
great
companion
to
a
dessert
that
featured
cocoanut
or
carmelized
ingredients
this
is
a
nice
doppelbock
while
it
is
a
rich
brew
it
still
retains
a
level
of
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
definitely
like
to
go
back
to
if
i
get
the
opportunity
you
know
i
wanted
more
after
drinking
this
but
stopped
myself
this
beer
was
excellent
had
on
tap
at
bones
served
in
a
10
5
oz
glass
pour
was
dark
ruby
in
color
with
very
low
head
this
thin
tan
head
did
last
throughout
my
glass
however
aroma
was
barleywine
like
consisting
of
dark
fruits
mostly
plums
in
this
case
medium
bodied
i
am
having
trouble
describing
the
taste
sorry
it
was
so
smooth
and
blended
and
nothing
sticking
out
and
trying
to
be
the
center
of
attention
mostly
rich
malt
with
very
slight
alcohol
in
the
background
some
caramel
notes
some
of
raisins
i
thought
there
was
subtle
hazenut
notes
in
the
finish
a
very
fine
beer
that
i
recommend
highly
well
this
is
rather
embarrassing
i
went
to
review
this
beer
and
found
out
that
i
already
reviewed
it
just
upping
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
to
4
5
cheers
the
flavor
is
so
far
the
best
i
have
had
for
a
doppelbock
as
it
begins
with
a
rich
blend
of
munich
malt
and
noble
hop
bitterness
which
segues
into
a
malty
almost
sweet
flavor
tha
finishes
with
a
lingering
roasty
malt
character
blended
in
with
banana
and
clove
esters
that
goes
away
fast
enough
to
make
you
want
another
drink
no
flaws
in
this
one
make
it
a
very
good
doppelbock
to
use
as
an
educational
tool
as
well
as
one
to
try
and
emulate
in
homebrewing
experiments
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
as
there
is
only
enough
carbonic
bite
to
accentuate
the
hop
bitterness
without
leaving
the
beer
fizzy
as
well
as
the
body
being
viscous
enough
to
flow
over
the
tongue
slowly
very
drinkable
even
the
high
alcohol
level
would
not
deter
me
from
having
a
couple
of
these
at
a
time
an
excellent
doppelbock
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
wishes
to
try
a
winter
warmer
from
a
country
besides
england
and
usa
mmmm
liquid
banana
bread
is
the
only
way
one
can
describe
this
luscious
beer
although
it
actually
doesnt
possess
the
cloying
and
sticky
sweetness
of
the
aforementioned
quickbread
this
is
a
beautiful
murky
brown
color
with
a
smell
reminiscent
of
banana
clove
cocoa
powder
and
a
little
roasted
burnt
grain
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
rum
bittersweet
cocoa
toffee
banana
with
an
ever
so
bitter
finish
just
the
tiniest
bit
of
hops
profile
peeking
out
to
say
hello
then
jumping
back
in
this
vat
of
banana
pudding
the
mouthfeel
is
so
creamy
and
thick
and
the
alcohol
is
so
wellhidden
i
could
probably
drink
several
of
these
easily
in
one
sitting
out
of
liter
steins
but
id
pay
the
price
not
quite
a
dessert
beer
though
but
a
sweet
session
beer
for
sure
dopplebockalicious
rich
bready
toffee
malt
flavors
up
front
kind
of
tastes
like
jagermeister
weirdinteresting
sweetness
fades
at
the
back
of
the
palate
into
a
mildly
bitter
herbal
finish
lingering
sticky
sweetness
and
licorice
big
bodied
chewy
but
not
too
syrupy
not
bad
but
ive
had
better
doppelbocks
but
this
is
right
up
there
nice
dark
color
big
cratering
white
head
smells
malty
of
course
but
there
are
fruity
notes
too
plum
raisins
etc
with
a
faint
citric
hoppyness
taste
is
sweet
heavily
malty
but
not
dry
or
bitter
with
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
at
the
end
good
mouthfeel
but
less
of
a
body
than
i
expected
great
drinkability
notes
no
trace
of
the
7
4
abv
detected
this
beer
is
absolutely
amazing
sweetness
is
balanced
and
not
overpowering
wonderfully
smooth
and
very
drinkable
just
amazing
watch
out
celebrator
doppelbock
youve
got
some
fierce
competition
i
like
the
contrast
of
this
versus
salvator
the
lighter
overall
character
yet
still
appropriate
for
style
a
little
easier
to
drink
than
salvator
less
bold
more
subtle
enjoyable
this
beer
is
highly
perhaps
dangerously
drinkable
given
its
alcohol
content
it
slides
down
your
throat
with
no
problems
at
all
if
they
sold
korbinian
where
i
live
texas
it
would
definitely
become
one
of
my
standby
winter
beers
of
course
winter
here
only
lasts
a
day
or
two
most
years
but
still
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
but
about
halfway
through
the
glass
i
cut
up
some
regianno
cheese
and
that
toned
it
down
quite
a
bit
pours
a
deep
coppery
brown
with
a
generous
tan
colored
head
that
retains
well
chewy
malty
nose
very
sweet
smelling
with
suggestions
of
treacle
and
dark
plum
or
prune
very
smooth
beer
with
its
roasted
malt
character
light
spiciness
and
a
carbonation
level
that
keeps
this
strong
beer
drinkable
faint
astringency
in
the
finish
that
is
slightly
hoppy
and
earthy
but
never
lets
you
forget
the
sweetness
there
was
one
of
these
left
over
from
my
beer
tasting
last
week
the
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
showing
only
some
reddish
tinges
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
tan
head
is
about
two
fingers
high
that
falls
to
a
quarter
inch
the
nose
is
full
of
carmel
and
malty
goodness
oh
this
is
good
there
are
sweet
caramel
malts
and
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
coming
through
this
is
thick
in
my
mouth
with
a
moderate
carbonation
of
small
bubbles
a
good
combination
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
this
is
a
beer
to
sit
down
to
on
a
nice
fall
night
its
not
too
filling
but
sits
nicely
in
my
somach
after
a
meal
pours
a
deep
reddishbrown
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
a
little
bit
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
rich
and
full
of
burnt
malt
and
caramel
almost
seems
to
have
the
qualities
of
a
good
stout
the
taste
is
sweet
with
roasted
malt
and
some
fruit
maybe
dates
just
a
great
flavor
the
body
is
fairly
strong
for
a
doppelbock
the
drinkability
is
good
for
such
a
strong
beer
another
nice
one
from
weihenstephan
the
korbinian
is
one
of
the
best
made
richest
and
most
enjoyable
doppelbocks
made
its
clear
russett
body
has
a
reddish
cast
and
displays
brilliant
orange
and
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
and
its
creamy
tan
head
holds
very
well
despite
its
alcoholic
strength
and
even
leaves
thin
sheets
of
lace
at
the
outset
of
the
glass
the
nose
however
is
possibly
the
most
exciting
part
it
smells
almost
like
fresh
wort
at
the
brewery
its
richly
malty
with
a
suggestion
of
caramel
the
body
is
full
and
its
fine
carbonation
gently
caresses
the
tongue
before
it
fades
smoothly
away
even
bolder
than
the
nose
is
the
flavor
its
simply
loaded
with
deep
rich
caramel
toffee
chocolate
and
even
a
light
cusp
of
coffee
theres
some
dark
fruit
present
but
its
not
bold
and
at
times
a
hint
of
hop
flavor
can
be
detected
otherwise
its
exceptionally
clean
not
even
showing
its
alcohol
its
exceptionally
well
balanced
for
such
a
rich
beer
as
well
and
its
sweet
malt
seems
to
simply
fade
away
in
the
finish
despite
the
fact
that
its
bitterness
is
limited
brilliant
its
rich
and
sweet
but
never
cloying
very
well
done
indeed
when
poured
it
was
a
reddish
brown
in
color
with
very
little
foam
the
smell
was
of
roasted
malts
and
spicies
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
of
roasted
malts
and
spicies
with
a
hint
of
caramel
had
a
pleasant
feel
on
the
palate
the
only
set
back
was
it
had
a
sour
feel
on
the
palate
along
with
a
little
bitterness
but
the
sour
taste
is
what
kind
of
turn
me
off
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
that
i
was
expecting
from
this
beer
either
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
for
me
and
after
one
beer
i
am
ready
for
something
a
little
more
bitter
and
clean
taste
initial
sweetness
with
a
slight
splash
of
carbonation
exploding
on
the
tongue
slight
sourness
in
the
middle
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
that
cleans
up
the
malt
sweetness
nicely
and
makes
this
a
rather
drinkable
beer
the
yeast
profile
makes
this
unique
for
a
doppel
but
its
a
fine
beer
nonetheless
big
foamy
and
sticky
offwhite
head
over
a
clear
ruby
brown
body
the
aroma
consists
of
sweet
maple
toffee
roasted
and
smoky
malt
dark
and
red
fruits
with
prominent
charactercherries
plums
and
an
enticing
earthiness
its
very
fruity
and
almost
smoky
but
actually
not
that
spectacular
after
a
few
sips
earthy
grape
bubble
gum
if
such
a
thing
exists
body
could
be
a
little
thicker
but
carbonation
is
moderate
and
appropriate
basically
the
palate
doesnt
seem
to
reveal
the
promised
secrets
from
the
sniffing
but
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
if
not
great
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
not
too
thick
not
too
thin
it
was
just
right
i
found
it
quite
enjoyable
and
drinkable
this
is
definitely
a
meal
in
a
bottle
pours
a
nice
deep
mohagony
color
with
a
large
tan
head
the
smell
is
pure
heaven
very
malty
aroma
with
notes
of
roasted
nuts
earthy
elements
and
a
strong
yeast
spice
in
it
the
flavor
is
also
strong
on
the
malt
side
lots
of
plums
seem
to
be
there
caramel
is
the
base
malt
and
main
flavor
chocolate
malts
come
and
go
as
they
please
i
also
notice
a
banana
and
slight
clove
taste
at
times
hops
are
there
to
prevent
this
influx
of
malts
from
being
too
sweet
and
cloying
yeast
is
prevalent
and
lends
a
dry
mouthfeel
alcohol
kick
comes
in
the
end
and
trickles
all
the
way
down
my
belly
what
an
experience
awesome
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
thought
it
was
very
representative
of
the
style
overall
quite
sweet
and
chewy
again
not
a
bad
thing
as
this
is
a
doppelbock
highly
recommended
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
boasts
of
roasted
malts
and
a
dry
yeast
scent
it
has
a
nice
subtle
dark
malt
aroma
that
is
not
sweet
but
still
pleasant
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
rich
malty
core
with
a
bit
of
black
and
roasted
malts
which
round
out
the
flavor
it
goes
down
a
tad
thick
and
finishes
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
doppelbock
but
ive
had
better
it
just
isnt
as
smooth
as
others
but
still
satisfies
with
good
flavor
a
respectable
double
bock
i
like
the
erdinger
version
a
bit
better
the
beer
pours
deep
mahogany
with
a
tan
foamy
head
the
smell
of
raisins
chocolate
carmel
toffee
and
coffee
taste
is
big
on
roasted
malts
with
a
grainy
flavor
that
has
a
raisin
like
flavor
when
the
alcohol
hits
your
palate
exceptional
in
every
sense
of
the
word
one
of
the
best
doppels
ive
had
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
out
there
from
a
great
brewery
in
weihenstephaner
im
glad
this
one
is
more
widely
available
now
john
copperybrown
hue
with
a
bloody
influence
when
i
held
it
up
to
the
light
i
noticed
loads
of
animation
racing
towards
the
light
beige
head
speaking
of
head
it
reached
an
apex
of
a
finger
and
a
half
in
height
it
then
faded
quickly
to
half
a
finger
then
to
a
soapy
cap
that
lingered
throughout
consumption
the
subsequent
lacing
was
very
modest
but
discernible
the
nose
had
its
moments
of
impressiveness
sticky
toffee
a
hint
of
dark
fruits
alcohol
and
a
strong
dose
of
good
ol
maltiness
behind
these
smells
are
notes
of
toastybreadycaramel
i
did
find
the
bouquet
to
be
a
little
airy
as
a
whole
the
aromas
are
pleasant
the
potency
is
a
tad
lacking
nevertheless
it
is
inviting
it
took
a
few
sips
before
the
flavors
really
sparked
any
interest
upfront
on
the
palate
i
detected
a
malty
plumy
toffee
combination
in
the
middle
an
average
caramel
noted
emerged
also
some
chocolate
pudding
was
added
to
the
mix
in
the
finish
the
alcohol
becomes
noticeable
this
was
a
lovely
addition
the
sweetness
is
really
restrained
it
is
even
a
little
dry
without
question
the
palate
is
tasty
but
it
doesnt
really
standout
like
urbock
23
or
samichlaus
bier
nor
is
it
as
yummy
as
sa
double
bock
or
celebrator
this
is
no
way
a
knock
against
korbinian
the
competition
is
tough
the
tummy
warming
affects
are
noticeable
mediumfull
in
body
the
carbonation
is
low
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
soft
and
maybe
even
a
little
unexciting
i
am
impressed
at
the
easy
of
consumption
considering
the
abv
in
other
words
it
is
very
drinkable
i
do
wish
this
beer
were
available
locally
as
it
would
be
something
id
quaff
again
i
purchased
my
bottle
in
iowa
city
this
is
a
top
ten
doppelbock
but
it
doesnt
standout
enough
for
me
great
flavor
banana
almond
caramel
molasses
coffee
cinnamon
sweet
malts
toasted
malts
and
other
spices
somewhat
herbal
very
good
tasting
doppelbock
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
like
to
revisit
it
soon

for

exceptional
dopplebock

oldest
brewery

a
nice

with

everything

45

great
on

day
outside
drinkability
a
solid
doppelbock
to
my
tastes
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
this
one
still
gives
them
a
run
for
the
money
though
16
ounce
bottle
when
purchasing
i
had
no
idea
this
was
a
dopplebock
i
find
it
interesting
this
beer
is
imported
by
bavaria
house
corp
in
wilmington
nc
and
is
illegal
to
be
sold
in

pint

a
clear

with

is
big
powerful

heavy
dose
of

and

the
olfactory
senses
mouthfeel
is
thick

plenty
of

mouthfeel
is
tart
and
fruity

quickly
reverts
to
its
strong
malt
character
molasses
caramel
and
dark

and
dates
are
dominant
here
hops
bitterness
becomes
evident
early
on
and
continues
the
rest
of
the
way
aftertaste
is
somewhat
unpleasant
by
its
syrupiness
this
is
an
interesting
beer
to
review
and
enjoy
but
it
doesnt
fare
well
when
compared
to
the
better
bavarian
doppelbocks
dark
caramel
color
topped
by
a
tan
lasting
head
sweet
malt
aromas
immediately
greet
me
upon
pouring
the
beer
slight
hint
of
noble
hops
dark
roasted
notes
in
the
flavor
coupled
with
decent
bitterness
mild
sweetness
is
coupled
with
a
grainy
finish
feels
a
bit
thin
on
the
palate
and
the
carbonation
is
much
milder
than
expected
decent
drinkability
but
this
one
still
lasted
me
a
while
more
of
a
dark
lager
or
bock
than
a
dopple
glad
i
tried
it
but
overrated
as
far
as
dopples
go
pours

nice
clear
gemlike
glow

makes
an
effort
to
stay
but
fizzes
quickly
down
to
a
thin
hazy
skim
and
ring

in
minimal
spots
aroma
is
a
bit
faint
of
toasty

dark

bit
more
filling
starts
a
little
weak
and
thin
but
begins
to
gain
malty
weight
with
a
nice
toffeeish
sweetness
and
finishes
strongly
with
a
nice
mixing
of
dark
fruits
of
plum
raisin
dates
and
figs
giving
way
to
a
little
chewy
caramel
lingering
finish
which
is
super
smooth
and
creamy
nice
finish
on
this
theres
a
bit
of
a
metallic
twinge
in
the
midway
parts
but
is
barely
noticeable
and
appears
mostly
at
the
front
of
the
tongue
and
the
lips
feel
is
close
to
medium
with
a
light
silken
creamyness
that
floats
through
the
palate
with
ease
and
the
finish
is
quite
nice
with
a
light
building
of
chewy
sweetness
a
soild
dopplebock
by
any
standards
good
stuff
a
good
solid
doublebock
poured
beautifully
letting
off
sweet
chocolate
and
malt
flavors
the
alcohol
is
not
apparent
until
mid
beer
when
you
start
to
feel
happier
about
the
world
and
that
you
are
blessed
to
be
able
to
drink
good
beer
like
this
for
2
65
for
a
bottle
dark

with
a

lovers
body
as
you
get
to
the
bottom
the
tastes
come
together
very
well
there
is
a
bit
of
sweetness
that
sticks
to
your
tongue
which
may
need
some
pretzels
to
help
with
buy
it
at
bevmo
in

a
hop
bite
starts
the
finish

is
quickly
overcome
by
a
sour
finish

drinkable
for
such
a
rich
beer

this

starts
off
the
the
way
it
smells

malty
with
a
welcome

and
dough

then
it
sort
of
dries

dry

the

this
beer
goes
down

this
is
what

used
to
be
before
they
destroyed
the

dopplebock

at

come
the
color

like

the
taste
here
is
quite
fine
again
maltomeal
deluxe
plenty
of
ripe
plump
and
sweet
juicy
raisin
chime
in
as
well
as
some
milky
chocolate
and
the
typical
nuttiness
of
the
style
half
way
through
the
glass
i
note
that
the
lace
is
firm
and
stickyit
aint
movin
this
is
a
fairly
delicate
version
of
the
style
yet
be
careful
as
the
abv
is

and
if
you
rush
youll
be
sorry
a
beer
this
good
makes
me
consider
the
monks

as
a
potential

gig
dark
reddishbrown
in
color
with
lots
of
large
chunks
of
yeast
floating
around
decent
half
inch
head
of
fairly
large
bubbles
that
dissipated
somewhat
quickly
down
to
a
thin
lace
very
very
strong
aroma
right
out
of
the
bottle
great
malty
nose
with
prunes
and
raisins
the
start
is
quite
smooth
the
malt
on
the
palate
is
again
sweet
as
well
as
a
little
spicy
with
a
hint
of
clove
being
noticeable
theres
some
light
yeastybreadines
notes
as
well
carbonation
is
moderate
and
theres
a
little
alcohol
bite
around
mid
swallow
that
quickly
subsides
the
finish
is
also
smooth
with
a
slight
bit
of
hops
the
aftertaste
is
rather
short
lived
i
really
liked
this
brew
quite
unique
and
interesting
with
a
rather
complex
flavor
profile
its
a
bit
strong
so
i
dont
know
how
drinkable
it
would
be
after
one
or
two
as
far
to
the
extra
as
some
west
coast
ipas
go
to
load
up

with
something
almost
salty
like
soy

in
there
could
be
crazy
or
it
could
be
the
chinese
food
i
had
before
i

this

a

up

this
ones
a
heavy
beer
which
begs
to
be
paired
with
heavy
food
i
had
it
over
bratwurst
and
kraut
and
cant
imagine
drinking
it
with
anything
else
hearty
doesnt
even
begin
to
describe
it
a
brewery
doesnt
last
since
1040
for
no
reason
i
guess
pours
to
a
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
it
forms
a
thick
tan

that
leaves
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
bit
of
graininess
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
the
flavor
is
of
sweet
malt
and
bread
it
is
also
a
bit
astringent
the
hop
flavor
is
almost
nonexistent
except
for
the
light
spiciness
a
good
medium
bodied
brew
this
one
is
cloudy
brown
with
lots
of
floaties
and
a
significant
head
that
dwindles
to
a
thin
layer
of
film
aroma
is
sweet
with
a
huge
malt
profile
full
bodied
with
a
creamy
feeling
mouthfeel
flavor
is
super
strong
and
malty
with
a
definite
alcohol
presence
theres
a
ton
of
malt
in
this
brew
and
not
much
else
resplendent
for
a
beer
that
sits
in
the
bottle
without
yeast
a
beautifully
designed
label
and
a
very
solid
beer
this
brew
has
a
very
nice
reddishbrown
color
with
a
puffy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
breadywheatyspicy
cookie
doughish
it
has
a
very
drinkable
mediumlight

with
a
chocolatecream
flavor
with
a
long
caramel
peppery
finish
a
nice
complex
dark
wheat
beer
very
versitile
for
summerwinter
and
with
food
i
like
it
this
brew
poured
a
large
creamy
head
of
light
brown
finely
sized
bubbles
it
has
an
extremely
nice
malty
aroma
that
is
very
pleasant
to
the
nose
the
body
of
this
beer
is
simply
beautiful
its
a
dark
almost
opaque
brown
color
with
some
carbonation
rising
up
the
side
of
the
mug
i
loved
the
taste
of
this
brew
with
elements
of
caramel
malt
and
spice
it
was
extremely
tasty
the
head
left
a
ring
of
lacing
around
my
mug
as
it
receded
this
is
an
extremely
good
example
of
why
i
like
doppelbocks
so
much
very
smooth
delicious
and
one
of
the
best
brews
i
have
had
in
a
while
einemal
bitte
once
again
im
himmel
gibt
es
kein
bier
darrum

wir
es
heir
translation
in
heaven
there
is
no
beer
that
is
why
we
drink
it
here
wow
what
a
beer
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
on
earth
hands
down
originally
sampled
this
on
draught
at
the
anthill
pub
u
of
california
irvine
early
2003
this
is
a
very
nice
doppelbock
dark
brown
body
w
a
tan
head
nice
malty
taste
smooth
sweet
this
is
a
great
beer
to
sit
down
and
savor
i
really
enjoyed
it
this
dark
brown
brew
is
an
exceptionally
flavorful
and
aromatic
beer
for
a
lager
even
a
stronger
one
like
a
bock
burnt
toast
light
notes
of
dark
fruit
and
poorly
executed
vegetable
stew
drifts
up
from
the
fairly
thick
brown
head
towards
my
nose
these
sensations
certainly
comprise
the
bulk
of
the
flavor
which
is
reminiscent
of
a
beerveggie
soup
very
herbal
and
organic
in
some
ways
not
too
hard
to
drink
by
any
means
excellent
personally
better
than
any
porter
or
stout
and
a
top
three
doppelbock
wow
this
is
one
heck
of
a
good
dopplebock
it
poured
a
medium
tan
head
with
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
mug
there
was
some
carbonation
observed
it
had
a
dark
brown
body
to
it
it
was
extremely
smooth
tasting
with
no
bitter
taste
observed
and
no
aftertaste
this
was
an
excellent
dopplebock
in
my
opinion
korbinian
is
a
legitimate
contender
in
the
doppelbock
category
similar
to
salvator
but
id
give
this
one
the
edge
deep
mohagany
hue
some
head
and
lace
wonderful
malty
flavor
caramel
notes
buttery
smooth
texture
sweet
but
not
overly
so
this
beer
along
with
tucher
bajuvator
are
somewhat
overlooked
when
people
compare
the
best
doppelbocks
i
still
would
put
the
celebrator
at
the
top
but
this
one
could
be
2
many
bighuge
thanks
to
cokes
for
lining
this
one
up
blows
the
hit
out
of
any
other
doppelbock
i
have
ever
tried
although
it
seems
a
little
thin
and
too
easy
drinking
at
times
to
be
a
heavyweight
doppel
nevertheless
i
love
this
beer
incredible
aroma
like
sweet
brown
sugar
glazed
plums
an
awesome
clean
mahogony
appearance
with
little
to
no
head
like
i
mentioned
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tich
thin
in
my
opinion
but
what
is
impressive
is
that
it
is
not
oversweet
in
the
mouth
and
that
is
saying
something
because
this
is
a
sweet
tasting
beer
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
can
i
give
it
a
69
i
guess
we
can
only
go
up
to
5
but
69
would
be
appropriate
because
i
could
taste
this
beer
all
night
long
over
and
over
and
over
and
that
brings
us
to
the
taste
dark
fruits
plums
and
burgandy
cherries
soaked
in
a
brown
sugarmolasses
mixture
what
a
treat
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
cokes
for
sending
this
my
way
i
will
name
my
next
kid
cokes
for
having
the
honor
of
trying
this
truly
spectacular
beer
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
and
definitely
my
favorite
doppel
of
alltime
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
color
with
a
medium
head
and
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
slightly
malty
with
hints
of
fruit
the
taste
was
very
smooth
and
sweet
with
a
thick
roasted
taste
to
it
the
drinkability
is
just
a
medium
because
it
is
very
sweet
and
very
thick
it
is
quite
enjoyable
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
several
in
a
row
its
very
dark
brown
with
a
nicely
sized
light
brown
head
i
love
the
aroma
strongly
of
roasted
maltiness
and
sweet
molasses
this
is
a
wonderful
creamy
and
fullbodied
brew
its
just
so
succulently
smooth
a
pleasing
and
soothing
alcohol
warth
finishes
off
an
awesome
malty
and
toasty
brew
i
just
plain
love
it
and
prefer
it
over
other
german
doppelbocks
i
have
tried
definitely
seek
this
beer
out
a
great
dopplebock
that
is
deep
redbrwon
in
color
with
a
malty
scent
it
is
rich
chocolatey
and
delicious
especially
if
you
like
dopplebocks
drink
with
dessert
or
alone
as
it
keeps
you
begging
for
more
so
smooth
and
rich
there
are
few
better
beers
of
this
style
in
the
world
if
you
can
find
it
you
are
lucky
if
you
are
in
munich
it
is
readily
available
from
behind
me
the
king
returns
weihenstephan
is
my
favorite
brewer
for
a
reason
i
had
never
heard
of
this
one
actually
before
my
friend
from
michigan
brought
this
down
for
me
a
beautiful
beer
a
great
mahogany
colorthick
very
appetizing
head
to
it
nice
sweet
malty
smell
with
caramel
and
a
little
burnt
taste
in
the
palate
the
way
it
should
be
alcohol
was
very
prevelant
in
taste
as
well
a
man
beer
from
a
world
class
brewer
this
beer
is
quite
a
departure
from
the
other
brews
offered
by
weihenstephan
their
wheat
beers
and
lager
are
terrific
but
i
was
a
bit
skeptical
about
whether
they
could
make
the
leap
to
more
hearty
fare
such
as
doppelbocks
i
neednt
have
worried
dark

with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
this
beer
gives
off
an
enticing
aroma
malty
sweet
with
a
sharp
prune
fruitiness
and
spicy
alcohol
notes
the
first
sip
reveals
a
fullbodied
creamy
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
nicely
sweet
but
balanced
by
a
mild
roastiness
appealing
fruit
flavors
make
their
appearances
midpalate
leading
to
a
surprisingly
dry
hop
finish
with
contributions
from
the
hops
and
the
notinsubstantial
alcohol
the
alcohol
also
makes
itself
known
by
a
certain
peppery
spiciness
toward
the
finish
and
a
gentle
warming
sensation
a
very
fine
beer
this
is
a
damn
fine
dopplebock
and
a
pleasant
surprise
despite
beling
labelled
as

abv
this
one
seems
to
pack
more
punch
than
that
id
like
to
try
this
in
a
blind
tasting
with
bajuvator
celebrator
and
salvator

that
would
be

beer
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
more
than
one
korbinian
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
a
deep
very
dark
brown
closing
in
on
black
had
a
thick
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
some
molasses
sweetness
in
the
nose
ive
been
very
turned
off
lately
with
big
dark
beers
finding
way
to
much
cloying
sweetness
this
beers
huge
malt
taste
stops
well
short
of
that
line
and
in
fact
runs
closer
to
coffee
than
sweetness
very
smooth
and
a
nice
beer
to
savor
on
a
cold
night
this
beer
had
a
very
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
as
well
look
for
it
its
murky
brown
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
smell
is
similar
to
what
i
experience
driving
home
from
the
homebrew
shop
with
a
big
bagful
of
malt
and
the
car
windows
closed
pure
malty
joy
the
taste
of
chocolate
is
immediately
apparent
but
toffee
and
spice
make
their
presence
known
as
the
beer
sits
its
decidedly
sweet
but
not
cloying
however
its
certainly
not
a
session
beer
this
is
a
good
special
occasion
beer
prosit
the
beer
is
luxurious
as
it
set
in
the
glass
blood
red
or
sanguineous
if
you
are
a
bit
squeamish
about
such
things
head
is
bountiful
with
fine
sheets
of
lace
that
weld
themselves
to
the
glass
nose
is
caramel
roasted
grains
fruit
sweet
quite
pleasing
to
the
nose
ambrosial
at
the
start
malt
dominated
with
a
middling
top
and
the
finish
purposeful
in
its
acidity
the

potent
aftertaste
is
quite
dry
and
a
bit
alcohol
bitter
aftertaste
from
the
7

abv
a
nice
tummy

robust
and
quite
a
pleasant
beer
to
quaff

luckily
i
didnt
spill
a
drop
dark
brown
not
the
black
i
was
expecting
nice
smallbubbled
offwhite
head
aroma
is
fruit
past
its
prime
flavor
is
light
caramelly
malts
no
real
hop
presence
but
some
odd
funky
spice
a
bit
sweet
and
syrupy
mouthfeel
is
lively
with
constant
steaming
bubbles
aromas
of
toasted
brown
bread
and
burned
sugar
carry
through
on
the
palate
where
they
pick
up
green
fruit
white
raisins
muesli
flowers
and
both
roasted
and
raw
hazelnuts
in
abundance
beautiful
the
long
complex
shifting
finish
inspires
images
of
spring
rain
on
hot
asphalt
this
was
leaner
that
the
other
two
beers
in
the
tasting
almost
a
different
style
and
my
favorite
more
challenging
not
easy
a
bit
wild
but
supremely
engaging
for
the
senses
as
well
as
the
intellect
let
it
grow
on
you

it
is
bloody
great
cloudy
brown
and
a
ton
of
suspended
sediment
flecks
floating
around
minimal
head
a
bit
of
lace
a
pleasant
aroma
of
dark
ripe
fruits
hints
of
chocolate
caramel
and
spice
mega
malty
taste
not
quite
doppelbock
territory
but
close
sweet
toffee
and
chocolate
flavors
some
caramel
too
spices
and
alcohol
oh
yeah
we
have
a
beer
here
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
the
doppelbock
leagues
but
it
still
kicks
butt
pretty
smooth
and
the
malt
load
should
satisfy
any
doppel
lover
why
these
weihenstephaner
beers
arent
reviewed
more
and
exalted
i
dont
know
im
impressed
by
the
sturdy
character
balance
and
quality
if
i
would
of
known
these
brews
were
so
good
i
would
have
bought
and
reviewed
them
long
before
what
a
pleasant
surprise
ruddy
deep
brown
in
hue
w
a
slight
haze
dense
tan
head
recedes
slowly
and
leaves
lace
nutty
sweet
caramel
buttery
toffee
upfront
in
aroma
followed
by
notes
of
toasty
munich
malt
and
mellow
chocolate
hint
of
fruity
sweetness
emerges
at
the
end
of
the
aroma
along
with
a
trace
of
cardboard
from
slight
oxidation
a
brash
of
molasses
sweetness
hits
the
palate
at
first
but
immediately
is
ensued
by
rich
caramelized
nutes
and
subtle
carob
sweetness
takes
on
a
darkly
fruity
raisiny
nature
mid
palate
moderate
in
body
w
full
dextrinous
mouthfeel
lent
by
the
low
apparent
attenuation
hop
bitterness
although
very
understated
prevents
the
prominent
malt
sweetness
from
becoming
sugary
and
cloying
finishes
with
a
hint
of
caramelized
fruit
melanoidins
and
more
toasty
munich
malt
pleasantly
lingering
although
a
sweet
brew
overall
korbinian
wasnt
at
all
cloying
the
sweetness
was
initially
molasses
like
then
took
on
a
toffee
character
and
ultimately
became
reminescent
of
dark
fruit
a
fine
brew
that
would
most
likely
be
phenomenol
if
consumed
fresh
superb
drinkability
for
the
relatively
high
strength
i
was
quite
a
bit
more
taken
with
this
bier
than
my
drinking
companion
bige
amber
with
a
thick
head
that
left
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
was
big
time
malt
with
some
spices
and
evident
alcohol
the
malt
couldnt
hang
with
the
big
dogs
in
the
taste
department
as
the
spices
and
alcohol
came
through
it
was
smooth
with
a
slight
sting
of
alcohol
what
i
expected
from
a
starkbier
very
drinkable
excellent
notes
a
tasty
malt
towering
brew
makes
for
a
great
dessert
or
end
of
the
night
brew
brewed
in
the
old
style
of
dunkles
starkbier
meaning
dark
strong
beer
more
or
less
can
be
classified
as
a
double
bock
due
to
its
massive
maltiness
and
boasting
an
alcohol
by
volume
of
7

16
oz
bottle
another
one
that
my
little
store
always
has
for
some
reason
i
have
been
saving
this
review
for
a
while
he
he
he
incredible
rich
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
fluffy
medium
head
the
color
of
heidi
klums
um
klums
klums
uh
oh
back
to
the
beer
super
sweet
malty
chocolate
taste
that
is
just
fine
with
me
very
rich
full
bodied
beer
that
demands
you
savor
it
full
bodied
and
nice
finish
it
only
lacks
the
slightly
bitter
balance
of
the
celebrator
i
wish
more
people
would
give
it
a
try
its
well
worth
the
effort
ok
this
has
great
flavor
with
the
malty
richness
ripe
fuit
flavor
but
i
could
not
get
past
the
sweetness
there
is
a
big
difference
between
malty
and
sweet
i
me
this
beer
seemed
underatenuated
i
think
it
was
too
sweet
even
for
a
bock
it
has
a
lot
going
for
it
and
if
it
was
not
so
damn
sweet
it
would
be
on
the
top
of
my
list
specially
at
the
price
people
are
going
to
think
that
i
do
nothing
but
trash
on
beers
but
i
call
em
as
i
drink
em
this
ranks
among
the
best
aroma
beers
ive
had
caramel
maple
toffee
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
first
sip
was
almost
as
good
lots
of
depth
of
flavor
with
caramel
and
roasted
malts
i
hardly
noticed
the
significant
alcohol
punch
at
7
4
which
hides
in
a
spicy
finish
very
nice
i
appreciate
the
beer
but
am
not
as
big
a
fan
of
this
one
would
not
turn
it
down
if
offered
one
and
might
even
grab
one
once
in
a
while
for
a
change
of
pace
someone
else
has
said
this
is
like
a
bbq
in
a
bottle
and
it
is
but
i
like
it
smokey
with
a
capital
s
i
honestly
this
would
go
great
with
some
wings
great
in
the
glass
at
the
schlenkerla
tavern
watching
the
tourists
blunder
about
and
great
from
the
bottle
in
the
usa
poured
int
a
snifter
to
enjoy
recommended
ummm
barbque
in
a
bottle
very
smoky
but
very
good
overall
its
a
very
nice
and
unique
beer
especially
if
you
consider
the
smoke
flavor
and
aroma
for
this
reason
alone
i
would
say
give
it
a
shot
its
not
the
malty
sweet
caramel
doppelbock
you
are
probably
used
to
but
it
is
its
own
beast
the
spicy
quality
of
the
beer
wins
a
merit
on
their
own
this
is
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
food
have
fun
with
it
the
flavor
profile
is
near
world
class
it
is
reasonably
intense
a
bit
complex
and
exceptionally
well
balanced
it
begins
with
a
burst
of
oak
smokiness
that
lacks
the
meaty
aspects
of
the
nose
that
slowly
blends
rather
than
fades
with
a
rich
underlying
sweetness
both
caramel
and
biscuit
notes
are
present
here
is
where
the
rich
malts
of
a
doppelbock
kick
in
in
the
middle
a
balancing
mild
bitterness
emerges
over
a
vanilla
note
the
finish
is
a
slow
fade
of
oak
smoke
and
sweetness
with
a
slight
note
of
alcohol
overall
my
first
encounter
with
a
schlenkerla
and
assuredly
not
my
last
id
call
this
more
of
a
rauchbier
than
a
doppelbock
as
the
primary
characteristic
is
the
smoke
theres
nowhere
near
the
level
of
bready
toffee
caramel
nutty
or
dark
fruit
flavors
i
would
associate
with
a
doppelbock
nor
the
sticky
mouthfeel
i
greatly
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
am
forced
to
rate
it
as
a
doppelbock
because
thats
how
its
classified
and
therefore
thats
the
stylespecific
ranking
it
will
appear
in
were
this
lumped
in
as
a
rauchbier
use
of
oak
instead
of
beech
notwithstanding
my
rating
would
be
far
higher
easily
over
a
4
in
every
category
heavy
smoke
and
oak
flavor
smooth
but
too
strong
of
flavors
overall
a
magnificent
beer
and
one
of
the
best
from
schlenkerla
that
ive
reviewed
so
far
the
smoke
character
in
this
one
is
much
similar
to
the
one
in
the
urbock
it
is
not
meaty
like
the
märzen
a
great
beer
and
one
that
i
found
is
very
approachable
for
the
style
looking
forward
to
trying
the
rest
of
the
schlenkerla
repertoire
o
its
not
the
smoke
i
mind
its
the
alcohol
bitterness
and
the
heavy
mouthfeel
its
pretty
rough
not
very
smooth
will
take
some
effort
to
finish
oak
smoked
sausage
leather
tobacco
the
smoke
is
what
it
is
im
not
the
biggest
fan
but
i
can
appreciate
that
this
beer
is
well
done
the
doppelbock
underneath
is
a
bit
too
sweet
and
onedimensional
and
cannot
fully
stand
up
to
the
smoke
needs
food
to
pair
it
with
something
thats
very
big
and
savory
but
not
too
sweet
in
itself
o
4
00
i
have
had
one
other
smoked
beer
from
germany
and
it
was
over
the
top
this
one
is
nicely
balanced
with
more
malt
character
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
very
crisp
and
refreshing
no
sense
of
alcohol
burn
no
drying
or
bittering
i
think
you
could
session
a
few
of
these
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
one
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
strong
smoke
sweet
malt
hint
of
pale
malt
and
a
hint
of
wheat
fits
the
style
of
a
doppelbock
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
slight
alcohol
strong
smoke
sweet
malt
slight
wood
hint
of
pale
malt
and
a
hint
of
wheat
overall
good
appearance
simple
aroma
that
is
mostly
smoke
great
feel
and
good
body
o
4
5
this
would
be
a
very
good
beer
without
the
smoke
with
it
its
great
the
flavor
is
rich
with
malt
flavors
with
slight
smoke
on
entry
and
sweet
nutty
flavor
with
light
hop
in
the
taste
balancing
some
toffee
in
the
middle
with
caramel
and
mild
brown
sugar
with
a
slight
fruitiness
in
the
yeast
with
a
slight
dried
apricot
and
mild
bready
toasted
flavor
adding
to
a
slight
cinnamon
and
vanilla
accent
with
slight
golden
raisin
type
sweet
and
earthy
flavor
there
is
a
mild
aromatic
smoke
in
the
dark
fruity
and
woody
finish
which
is
not
downplayed
at
all
and
compliments
the
layers
of
malt
with
slight
taste
of
alcohol
in
the
mostly
dry
finish
overall
this
is
wonderful
and
i
think
the
oak
smoke
in
the
dopplebock
fits
very
well
with
truly
delicious
results
a
great
example
of
how
smoke
can
enhance
and
already
great
example
of
the
dopplebock
style
enjoyable
in
its
subtlety
yet
fully
flavored
and
rich
w
out
any
alcohol
in
the
flavor
which
makes
it
deceptively
drinkable
and
the
smoke
perfectly
implemented
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
enjoys
smoked
beer
strong
lager
or
a
dopplebock
fan
o
the
smoke
really
defies
the
doppelbock
category
but
otherwise
is
a
great
example
of
the
base
style
smoke
is
mild
enough
to
allow
its
inclusion
but
its
a
unique
entry
very
good
beer
seems
to
accomplish
its
intended
goal
very
well
it
is
their
christmas
brew
but
i
think
it
could
be
great
in
early
spring
or
fall
overall
a
nice
malty
doppelbock
with
the
twist
of
adding
the
smoked
meat
and
sausage
spices
to
the
brew
this
one
is
definitely
an
interesting
brew
for
those
wanting
to
venture
off
the
beaten
path
from
your
standard
doppelbock
overall
this
is
just
a
great
beer
smoked
taste
takes
a
lot
of
place
unfortunately
the
doppelbock
side
is
quite
hidden
o
really
awesome
and
original
never
had
a
beer
like
this
at
all
and
wasnt
disappointed
syrupy
fullbodied
utterly
balanced
a
brewery
famous
for
their
rauchbiers
this
did
not
disappoint
a
unique
classic
love
the
oak
smoke
malt
flavor
great
cloudy
color
and
awesome
nose
would
be
perfect
wish
some
smokey
pulled
pork
with
a
nice
south
carolina
vinegar
dipping
sauce
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
well
worth
drinking
i
cannot
recommend
it
enough
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
one
again
had
so
much
promise
on
the
nose
lots
of
character
but
it
just
feels
muffled
still
a
fascinating
palate
i
have
to
give
kudos
for
the
complexity
food
match
triamisu
if
you
havent
figured
this
out
by
now
i
am
totally
making
this
shit
up
smoke
is
far
more
prevalent
in
the
aroma
than
the
flavor
which
is
actually
fairly
balanced
would
be
a
little
sweet
for
a
doppelbock
but
the
smoky
notes
prevent
that
from
being
noticed
a
pretty
deft
application
of
the
rauchbier
treatment
to
a
big
doppelbock
the
german
version
of
overt
style
blending
i
guess
everything
comes
off
well
enough
the
smoke
having
its
way
with
my
palate
before
ceding
the
floor
to
the
equally
sturdy
strong
like
bull
base
lager
once
again
a
tad
scary
at
first
contact
but
by
the
end
its
got
me
wondering
about
the
times
when
all
beer
tasted
at
least
a
bit
like
this
another
excellent
addition
to
the
schlenkerla
lineup
sweet
malt
accented
with
the
deep
smoked
malts
reminiscent
of
smoked
meats
copper
body
with
small
creamy
head
fine
carbonation
and
lots
of
suspended
particulates
aroma
of
wood
smoke
from
a
fire
taste
comes
in
with
sweet
malt
and
smoked
meats
abrupt
finish
with
some
lingering
smokiness
rauchbiers
are
an
acquired
taste
but
this
is
a
fine
example
the
taste
is
alive
with
smoked
cheese
and
smoked
goodness
caramel
malts
and
mild
hops
seem
secondary
i
love
beers
with
a
good
smoked
quality
and
this
one
really
does
the
trick
i
could
have
it
multiple
times
world
class
smoke
beer
well
brewed
and
nicely
done
would
definitely
drink
again
as
im
a
big
fan
of
this
style
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
that
looks
almost
ruby
reddish
given
the
right
light
nice
lacing
smell
of
smoke
is
not
as
intense
as
the
darker
cousin
tons
of
white
particles
this
beer
has
substance
and
is
alive
lots
of
faint
fruitiness
tastes
great
and
not
too
heavy
a
nice
summer
smokey
alternative
to
the
darker
beer
great
beer
served
in
short
glasses
at
a
tasting
very
nice
appearance
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
every
day
but
very
unique
the
smokiness
was
overpowering
at
times
leave
subtleness
out
in
this
one
and
agreed
from
previous
comments
that
this
is
best
had
ice
cold
i
would
buy
again
for
a
group
tasting
to
get
a
variety
of
opinions
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
overall
a
great
doppelbock
and
smoked
beer
definitely
recommend
if
you
like
this
style
oak
smoke
is
another
outstanding
beer
from
schlenkerla
the
smoke
is
more
subdued
than
most
of
their
offerings
besides
the
hells
and
therefore
more
approachable
this
even
handedness
with
the
smoke
allows
the
bready
sweetness
to
shine
through
so
the
base
can
be
enjoyed
as
well
recommended
o
i
believe
this
to
be
a
great
approach
on
a
doppelbock
it
gives
it
an
extra
spicyness
to
the
flavor
profile
and
at
the
same
it
allows
the
doppelbock
to
be
a
doppelbock
for
8
this
is
a
brew
i
would
definitely
go
back
to
again
and
again
given
the
right
circumstances
overall
one
of
the
best
smoked
beers
i
have
tasted
a
classic
german
smoked
beer
look
for
it
o
change
of
pace
beer
to
have
once
in
a
very
long
while
but
i
only
got
halfway
through
the
pint
and
am
not
interested
in
coming
back
anytime
soon
highly
enjoyable
lack
of
headpoor
lacing
detracts
from
the
appearance
but
served
closer
to
50
degrees
the
head
is
quite
nice
another
good
rauch

bamberg
amazing

the

makes
you
enjoy
it

like
a

with
some
toasted

and
a
hint
of

flavor
not
sweet
at
all

is
lighter
than
expected
very
drinkable
smooth

and
lightmedium

is
memorable
since
i
would
expect
much
more
heaviness
in
texture
with
beer
of
this
many
layers
would
pair
awesome
with
sausage
salmon
creamcheese
dill
herbs
mustard
smoked
trout
im
enjoying
this
one
to
a
certain
extent
but
im
not
entirely
sure
that
if
the
smoke
were
gone
id
still
enjoy
the
beer
underneath
it
if
its
smoke
you
really
like
or
if
youre
just
in
the
mood
for
something
different
this
might
be
the
one
for
you
this
intense
of
a
smoked
beer
will
never
be
my
favorite
thing
but
i
still
did
enjoy
it
overall
this
was
a
quality
doppelbock
in
the
true
style
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
is
loaded
with
malts
and
would
no
doubt
sustain
the
monks
through
the
lent
season
taste
is
smoke
through
and
through
just
as
i
expect
and
want
from
one
of
their
brews
sweet
here
and
there
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
smooth
over
the
tongue
and
drinkability
is
wow
id
get
this
one
again
quickly
prost
o
if
you
like
smoke
cured
meatcharcuterie
etc
you
will
love
this
definitely
distinct
well
made
but
probably
not
for
everyone
pours
a
crystal
clear
medium
golden
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
cap
smells
of
campfire
bbq
chips
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
i
really
cant
get
past
the
smoke
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
deep
underneath
a
smokey
woody
facade
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
phenolic
mouthfeel
really
smokey
a
bit
one
dimensional
but
damn
it
was
easy
to
enjoy
another
great
beer
i
dont
see
how
schlenkerla
fits
this
much
smoke
in
a
beer
its
really
good
o
i
might
have
had
an
older
bottle
i
liked
this
but
i
might
have
loved
it
if
it
wasnt
as
sugary
are
there
any
other
smoked
doppelbocks
to
try
beer
is
mediumheavy
in
body
with
low
levels
of
carbonation
resulting
in
a
smooth

the
thick
smoke
and
caramel
flavors
of
the
beer
closes
dry
with
mediumhigh
stickiness
clinging
to
the
lips
and
palate
o
i
was
pleased
to
buy
this
very
good
especially
when
you
are
craving
a
doppelbock
give
it
a
try
good
as
always
a
nicely
complex
and
interesting
rauchbier
from
schlenkerla
its
not
my
favorite
of
theirs
but
the
biggerdoppelbock
take
on
this
one
definitely
supplies
its
own
unique
charm
the
taste
is
like
toasted
biscuits
sweet
molasses
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
as
well
as
the
mesquitelike
flavor
of
the
oak
smoke
no
detectable
alcohol
notes
except
for
a
slight
warming
sensation
mediumfull
texture
prickly
carbon
dioxide
release
on
the
tongue
overall
interesting
beer
glad
i
tried
it
unlikely
to
revisit
pours
an
auburn
hue
into
my
goblet
theres
a
very
thin
ring
for
a
head
but
the
beer
has
a
great
gemlike
clarity
to
it
minimal
to
no
lacing
aroma
like
that
of
charred
embers
oakiness
and
a
savory
characteristic
like
their
other
selections
the
flavor
is
pleasantly
complex
charred
wood
molasses
brown
bread
smoked
cheese
and
peppercorn
notes
can
be
detected
within
the
mix
the
finish
is
soft
with
a
faint
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
a
noticeable
abv
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
three
schlenkerla
rauchbiers
i
have
tasted
500ml
bottle
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
a
slight
gusher
off
the
bottle
pop
pours
a
dull
amber
hue
with
a
loose
fizzy
oneinch
creamcolored
head
the
sizzles
and
pops
as
it
dissipates
into
a
broken
slick
nose
expresses
smoked
salt
pork
some
malty
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
toffee
in
the
background
taste
is
really
quite
interesting
the
malt
and
toffee
come
out
in
the
foreground
with
the
smoked
salt
pork
pleasantly
integrated
into
the
background
a
juxtaposition
of
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
a
pleasant
even
carbonation
and
some
residual
saltiness
overall
an
interesting
beer
not
my
favorite
from
schlenkerla
but
a
pretty
unique
example
of
the
style
overall
i
could
possibly
justify
calling
this
my
favorite
beer
ever
ok
so
im
an
admitted
fan
of
schlenkerla
even
though
the
smoke
is
often
off
the
charts
hint
age
it
3
years
and
itll
smooth
out
all
their
flavors
mellow
out
wonderfully
with
age
and
this
one
is
as
intriguing
as
the
others
but
different
as
a
doppelbock
this
is
way
smoky
and
flavorwise
bodacious
but
also
very
drinkable
to
those
that
appreciate
a
good
smoked
brew
to
me
it
tasted
like
the
brewery
combined
the
rauchbier
style
with
the
doppelbock
style
a
part
of
me
wished
that
there
were
more
smoky
flavors
in
the
taste
and
aftertaste
i
think
my
taste
buds
were
jealous
with
what
my
nose
smelled
it
was
the
aroma
of
this
beer
that
made
it
for
me
would
i
drink
this
beer
again
probably
not
if
i
want
a
smoky
beer
ill
order
a
rauchbier
or
a
smoked
porter
if
i
want
a
doppelbock
ill
order
a
doppelbock
i
dont
want
to
cut
any
corners
and
get
another
bottle
of
a
smoky
doppelbock
pretty
damn
good
if
i
had
to
choose
id
say
i
like
this
better
than
the
marzen
but
not
quite
as
much
as
the
urbock
the
smoke
flavors
are
a
little
more
balanced
in
the
way
that
the
malt
character
seems
to
be
much
more
loaded
up
in
this
one
the
oak
makes
a
very
solid
contribution
to
the
flavor
as
well
very
enjoyable
to
drink
hellertrum
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
overseas
breweries
o
i
like
rauchbiers
this
is
no
exception
it
may
have
invigorated
my
love
this
beer
leaves
me
craving
salty
snacks
and
pork
products
this
would
be
great
with
barbecue
or
anything
with
bacon
involved
o
a
very
good
smoked
doppelbock
with
just
the
right
amount
of
smoke
to
compliment
the
huge
amounts
of
malt
used
one
of
my
favorites
when
its
available
as
a
big
fan
of
smoke
beers
this
may
be
my
favorite
from
schlenkerla
the
fact
that
doppelbocks
are
among
my
favorite
styles
earns
this
beer
points
as
well
poured
into
a
glass
the
beer
had
a
murky
brown
color
with
variations
the
aroma
reminded
me
most
of
smoked
ham
even
though
i
do
not
eatlike
ham
i
love
the
aroma
in
the
initial
taste
one
gets
the
best
qualities
of
a
doppelbock
and
a
smoke
beer
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
jumps
to
the
front
but
it
is
nicely
balanced
by
the
character
of
the
smoke
in
both
case
the
sizes
of
the
taste
are
huge
while
balancing
each
other
out
the
malts
sour
slightly
in
the
aftertaste
while
the
smoke
lingers
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
the
thick
texture
allows
the
smoke
to
stick
this
is
a
welldeveloped
smoke
beer
and
a
fabulous
example
of
a
doppelbock
started
to
gush
upon
opening
i
was
at
first
concerned
about
infection
nice
golden
amber
color
very
clean
looking
moderate
amount
of
smoke
in
the
aroma
mild
malt
behind
all
that
big
huge
smoke
flavor
label
says
oak
but
i
really
get
the
cherrywood
smoke
in
there
sweeness
from
the
malt
very
clean
even
with
the
huge
smoke
flavor
damn
solid
mouthfeel
more
and
more
enjoyable
as
it
goes
down
really
worth
trying
someday
i
will
do
a
side
by
side
of
all
of
this
breweries
beers
this
one
seems
like
one
of
the
more
complex
ones
maybe
because
of
the
higher
abv
and
darker
malts
what
a
great
brewery
i
do
somewhat
prefer
the
rauchbier
marzen
because
the
darker
malt
flavors
make
it
so
drinkable
however
this
is
quite
amazing
purchased
on
recommendation
of
matthew
of
virginia
wine
warehaus
in
charlottesville
va
fame
his
admonition
dont
let
beer
advocate
hype
strangle
yr
taste
instincts
respect
pours
a
nice
amber
pretty
ho
hum
no
indication
of
the
tidal
wave
of
taste
to
come
odor
wafts
up
with
soft
smells
of
smoke
where
theres
smoke
theres
fire
the
taste
is
immediate
charred
smoked
burnt
formerly
on
fire
swallowing
doesnt
erase
the
memory
of
the
inferno
years
cant
erase
the
memory
not
the
best
of
the
aecht
line
up
im
not
sure
the
heavy
maltsweetness
works
well
pressed
up
against
all
of
that
smoke
but
it
may
be
that
they
just
need
to
adjust
the
ratios
a
bit
o
i
had
super
high
expectations
and
that
led
me
to
be
a
bit
underwhelmed
not
as
phenomenal
as
i
had
hoped

initially
i
thought
the

was

too
strong
but
the
taste
is
growing
on
me
the

combination
seems
to
work
better
than
dry

comes
across
like
an

with
a
solid
dollop
of
smokiness
in

m
full

low

finishes
dry

well

this
is
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
tried
in
some
time
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
and
the
smoked
doppelbock
is
something
ill
definitely
keep
my
eyes
open
for
from
now
on
overall
this
beer
is
a
unique
character
and
one
that
every
beer
drinker
should
try
at
least
once
perfect
companion
with
smoked
meats
the
aftertaste
continues
with
malt
and
smoke
flavors
hops
are
very
low
down
anywhere
as
is
any
booze
flavor
overall
this
is
a
great
german
bier
and
a
very
easy
drinking
doppelbock
this
smoked
doppelbock
is
superbly
balanced
there
is
no
denying
the
smoked
malt
here
but
it
is
so
controlled
and
it
lets
the
rich
malt
sweetness
shine
through
which
brings
its
own
character
to
the
table
as
well
i
would
revisit
this
beer
anytime
very
good
and
i
easily
downed
that
500ml
bottle
by
myself
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amberred
with
a
thin
tan
head
aromas
of
freshly
smoked
barbeque
and
some
toffee
taste
is
a
powerful
smoked
meat
flavor
up
front
followed
by
some
dark
caramel
then
some
oak
flavor
then
a
bit
of
earthiness
from
the
hops
the
finish
is
similar
to
that
of
some
wonderful
smoked
meats
mouthfeel
is
rich
overall
an
amazing
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
this
from
my
local
stores
meaty
smoky
sweet
i
like
the
sweet
malts
do
a
good
job
balancing
the
smoke
the
8
abv
is
hidden
extremely
well
o
not
your
typical
doppelbock
if
you
like
woody
flavors
this
is
for
you
a
different
kind
of
smokiness
compared
to
their
other
beers
but
its
an
awesome
departure
from
this
style
these
guys
cant
make
a
bad
smoke
beer
i
cant
even
imagine
drinking
these
brews
at
their
brewery
it
will
happen
pours
a
gorgeous
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
twofinger
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
hang
around
too
long
some
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
smoked
ham
and
toasted
bread
with
a
grainy
earthiness
to
it
smoky
flavor
up
front
then
the
sweet
caramel
malts
come
forward
there
is
a
nice
earthy
hop
flavor
and
some
dark
fruity
flavors
that
linger
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
definitely
a
dopplebock
and
the
smoke
flavor
doesnt
cover
it
up
nice
balance
medium
body
and
a
nice
low
level
of
carbonation
smooth
and
silky
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
at
8
abv
and
a
very
good
and
unique
version
of
the
style
the
oaksmoked
malt
is
definitely
more
subtle
than
their
beechsmoked
offerings
i
have
to
say
this
is
my
favorite
from
aecht
schlenkerla
if
you
didnt
like
smoked
beers
youve
tried
before
i
didnt
i
would
recommend
trying
this
one
it
is
definitely
unique
for
what
this
is
they
really
hit
the
mark
here
beautiful
meld
of
sweet
toffee
and
caramel
meets
the
aggressive
smoke
character
big
thanks
to
illudium
for
the
sample
o
offers
a
complexity
not
usually
found
in
dopplebocks
but
doesnt
over
power
the
palate
schlenkerla
works
magic
in
my
book
and
this
may
be
the
best
of
all
the
rest
very
tasty
an
excellent
rauchbier
o
definitely
putting
this
one
in
my
top
3
for
smoked
beers
i
probably
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
bottle
in
a
sitting
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
bottle
if
you
are
holding
this
beer
thinking
should
i
try
this
the
answer
is
yes
this
is
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
enjoys
good
beer
and
im
positive
the
majority
of
those
people
will
enjoy
it
as
well
this
was
some
amazing
smokey
stuff
oakaged
beers
can
have
a
vanilla
flavor
to
them
but
this
is
oaksmoked
this
beer
is
woody
and
smokey
with
plenty
of
sweet
caramel
malt
backbone
but
dry
enough
to
invite
the
next
sip
to
recap
theres
wood
theres
smoke
bacon
there
caramel
malts
and
pleasant
finish
hops
no
flavoring
hops
noticed
here
but
the
bitterness
is
an
important
component
to
balancing
things
out
but
this
is
not
bitter
is
this
a
malt
bomb
yes
and
a
darn
good
smokey
one
quite
possibly
my
new
favorite
smoked
beer
o
my
new
favorite
from
schlenkerla
o
as
a
fan
of
anything
smoke
this
fits
right
in
while
i
think
i
would
still
prefer
the
rauchbier
unbock
or
the
weizen
i
would
still
look
forward
to
this
one
during
the
holiday
season
very
interesting
beer
this
is
a
tough
one
to
gauge
since
i
like
smoked
beers
for
the
most
part
but
this
one
i
think
needs
to
grow
on
you
taste
is
definitely
heavy
i
get
lots
of
wood
hahah
smoky
meat
and
a
nicely
warming
dry
finish
this
one
is
8
after
all
i
get
more
wood
here
no
doubt
the
malts
aged
over
smoked
oak
adds
to
this
heaviness
more
than
the
regular
schlenkerlas
beechwoodsmoked
malts
absolutely
a
pinnacle
of
rauchbier
goodness
this
schlenkerla
is
tough
to
find
at
least
in
my
area
but
well
worth
the
experience
another
great
smoked
beer
from
schlenferlapossibly
the
smokiest
of
them
all
bottle
poured
a
deep
clear
brown
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
of
smoked
malt
is
powerful
though
well
balanced
by
some
caramel
malt
taste
is
a
great
balance
between
some
caramel
malt
with
some
light
sweet
notes
and
a
good
level
of
smoked
notes
body
is
not
as
full
as
expected
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
well
brewed
and
not
as
smoky
as
expected
since
the
malt
really
cut
through
some
of
the
smoke
o
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
more
of
a
rauchbier
than
doppelbock
but
still
tasty
and
drinkable
really
enjoyed
this
beer
ive
been
to
bamberg
a
few
times
and
have
struggled
to
embrace
the
whole
rauch
scene
in
general
wish
id
found
this
during
my
visits
it
might
have
changed
my
view
of
smoky
brews
oak
obviously
does
it
for
me
rather
than
the
beech
i
was
a
little
surprised
by
the
lightness
of
the
feel
though
it
manages
about
a
medium
body
considering
both
its
style
and
the
robustness
of
its
overall
character
crispness
is
on
an
even
keel
with
smoothness
if
not
more
though
its
not
overdone
a
really
excellent
rauchbock
tons
of
smoke
and
malt
flavour
very
good
overall
i
really
liked
smoked
beers
and
i
do
not
get
them
very
often
i
am
happy
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
i
would
get
it
again
a
distinctive
doppelbock
with
its
oak
smoked
malt
a
classic
doppelbock
character
predominates
the
smoked
malt
adding
a
slightly
different
perspective
but
without
overwhelming
everything
even
if
you
find
schlenkerlas
rauchbiers
too
much
for
you
its
worth
trying
out
this
milder
cousin
from
this
fine
brewery
especially
if
you
like
doppelbocks
a
real
experience
of
a
beer
a
really
nice
incorporation
of
a
huge
phenolic
barbequey
smoke
into
a
rich
malty
doppelbock
a
big
beer
with
a
lot
of
rich
malty
character
to
match
the
intense
smokiness
if
youre
up
for
it
this
is
a
solid
smoky
doppelbock
worth
trying
pours
a
rich
amber
maple
syrup
with
a
scant
haze
thin
layer
of
white
froth
perched
atop
the
liquid
intriguing
smokiness
in
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
bbq
ribs
perhaps
a
wood
fireplace
some
rich
malty
sweetness
is
present
in
the
background
far
less
apparent
than
the
dominant
smoke
despite
the
strong
smoke
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
leans
more
towards
your
traditional
dopplebock
with
carameltoffee
malty
sweet
a
subtle
prune
fruitiness
and
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
smoke
is
certainly
here
and
lingers
into
the
finish
medium
full
body
with
a
moderate
low
carbonation
level
overall
an
interesting
blend
of
doppelbock
and
smoke
beer
wellbalanced
and
enjoyable
i
wont
buy
this
one
again
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
slightly
hazy
reddish
copper
with
a
soapy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
there
appears
to
be
a
moderate
amount
tiny
bubbles
in
the
beer
the
smoked
malt
aroma
immediately
hits
the
nose
i
can
detect
some
of
the
breadiness
and
sweetness
from
the
malt
the
smokiness
in
the
flavor
is
quite
intense
the
oak
smoke
really
comes
through
here
it
blends
well
with
the
breadiness
and
sweetness
from
the
malt
its
rich
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
because
the
smoke
helps
balance
everything
well
it
all
helps
mask
the
8
alcohol
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
does
stick
to
the
mouth
briefly
this
drinks
pretty
well
for
such
a
big
beer
this
is
an
excellent
beer
a
nice
balance
of
smokey
and
sweet
on
the
palate
campfire
and
just
a
hint
of
bacon
and
lots
of
caramel
and
toffee
notes
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
creamy
as
well
this
could
certainly
make
a
great
holiday
dessert
beer
this
is
a
unique
beer
i
like
everything
ive
had
from
these
guys
but
this
one
might
be
my
favorite
just
because
of
how
different
it
is
it
pours
a
dusty
bacon
red
color
with
a
lively
and
frothy
one
inch
just
off
white
head
the
nose
is
smokey
as
hell
just
as
much
as
their
rauchbier
i
think
its
close
anyways
there
is
a
sweet
malty
richness
thats
quite
obvious
and
the
smoke
profile
is
odd
its
a
lot
like
the
weber
when
i
do
a
pork
shoulder
over
oak
chips
a
really
similar
vibe
the
flavor
isnt
oaky
in
the
barrel
aged
sense
but
in
the
burning
oak
sense
really
far
out
it
tastes
like
a
big
old
turkey
leg
or
something
midieval
and
hearty
almost
arrogant
its
really
meaty
in
feel
too
thick
and
saturated
with
flavor
good
carbonation
too
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
for
this
time
of
year
it
tastes
like
october
to
me
but
it
isnt
something
i
need
to
drink
a
whole
lot
of
i
was
still
tasting
it
this
morning
really
powerful
flavor
here
d
one
is
more
than
enough
good
to
try
4

d
this
brand
is
the
one
to
go
to
when
you
want
slapped
silly
with
smoke
very
tasty
the
smell
is
smokier
than
the
taste
and
very
likely
therein
lies
this
beers
success
the
overall
experience
is
balanced
im
glad
i
finally
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
a
very
nice
smoke
beer
among
the
best
keeps
me
coming
back
to
the
classic
of
classics
when
it
comes
to
this
style
as
with
their
other
beers
a
nice
balance
of
smoke
to
malt
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
a
welcome
addition
to
the
schlenkerla
family
aecht
schlenkerla
eiche
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
with
about
two
fingers
of
off
white
foam
crowning
the
beer
head
retention
is
short
lived
and
lacing
is
minimal
the
nose
is
fairly
onenote
but
it
has
a
nice
hickory
smoked
bacon
aroma
the
glavor
gas
a
solid
bready
malt
opening
the
rauch
malt
then
comes
in
to
finish
out
the
flavor
profile
with
a
pleasant
smoked
meatbarbecue
presence
theres
a
nice
sturdiness
to
the
body
while
staying
short
of
being
overbearingly
chewy
the
carbonation
is
subtle
just
enough
to
cut
through
the
malt
even
if
aecht
schlenkerlas
eiche
is
classified
as
a
doppelbock
the
use
of
smoked
malt
renders
it
a
bit
idiosyncratic
for
the
style
while
its
intensely
smoky
its
not
too
much
once
one
takes
a
couple
sips
and
gets
acclimated
o
there
is
a
definite
strong
smoke
presence
here
however
it
seems
to
flow
well
with
everything
without
having
any
harsh
edges
i
admit
that
im
not
normally
one
for
a
smoked
beer
but
this
was
an
extremely
well
crafted
product
not
quite
on
par
with
the
others
from
this
brewery
too
sweet
and
the
oaky
smoke
and
sweet
malt
seem
a
little
discordant
rather
than
complimentary
as
youd
find
in
the
urbockmarzen
still
really
enjoyable

one
of
my
favorite
smoked
beers
very
very
interesting
indeed
im
not
sure
how
much
difference
the
oak
verses
beechwoodsmoke
character
makes
its
still
exceptionally
smoky
but
i
feel
as
though
it
has
a
smoothness
that
isnt
altogether
to
do
with
the
extra
body
and
extra
malt
an
exceptionally
interesting
brew
overall
i
probably
liked
this
one
the
best
of
the
3
i
had
it
was
pretty
onesided
but
had
no
offnotes
i
found
in
the
others
marzen
and
urbock
mostly
full
bodied
with
a
light
almost
faint
effervescence
a
sipping
beer
for
certain
especially
considering
the
abv
and
a
very
good
one
if
you
ask
me
while
their
marzen
is
my
favorite
from
hellertrum
this
one
isnt
bad
either
the
smoke
is
more
nuanced
and
less
sweet
and
for
an
8abv
beer
its
pretty
easy
drinking
o
wasnt
sure
what
to
think
at
first
but
i
started
to
enjoy
this
more
as
i
got
near
the
end
of
my
little
sample
suggesting
this
is
something
that
needs
to
be
savored
in
larger
quantities
an
acquired
taste
to
be
sure
o
i
could
not
choke
this
down
this
flavor
is
just
not
for
me
i
guess
my
experience
with
smoked
beers
is
limited
i
have
had
some
that
were
okay
but
the
smoke
flavor
in
this
one
is
very
strong
overall
quite
a
novelty
and
always
an
enjoyable
treat
but
not
a
beer
to
be
consumed
regularly
for
special
occasions
another
great
work
of
brewers
art
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
overall
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
choose
this
over
the
standard
rauch
offerings
from
aecht
schlenkerla
truly
truly
delicious
just
want
to
drink
this
outside
before
a
roaring

a
plate
of
quality

pours
cloudy

color
with
a
small
1

dense
light
khaki
head
with
good

that
reduces
to
a
thin

that
lingers
some
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
of
big
wood
smoked
meat
charcoal
raisin
molasses
caramel
toffee
banana
apple
and
herbal
spiciness
very
nice
and
well
balanced
aromas
with
good
complexity
the
smoked
aspect
compliments
the
standard
doppelbock
aromas
nicely
taste
of
caramel

raisin
smoke

toffee
biscuit
pepper
light
citrus
and
herbal
spiciness
lingering
notes
of
smoke
caramel
molasses
biscuit
and
fruitiness
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
great
balance
of
flavors
with
more
standard
doppelbock
flavors
going
on
without
the
smokiness
becoming
too
overwhelming
medium
carbonation
and
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
nice
creamy
and
fairly
slick
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
hardly
any
warming
noticed
at
all
dangerously
smooth
to
drink
for
8
but
is
definitely
great
to
sip
on
overall
this
is
an
excellent
and
highly
enjoyable
smoked
doppelbock
great
balance
of
flavors
without
the
smoke
being
over
the
top
great
stuff
o
ive
gotta
give
this
a
5
definitely
my
favorite
smoked
beer
so
far
p
s
some
will
suggest
this
with
bbq
or
smoked
meat
i
think
that
smokey
meats
may
overdo
the
whole
smoke
flavor
i
had
it
with
a
chicken
caesar
salad
salty
with
lots
of
bleu
cheese
very
nice
contrast
of
smokey
and
salty

a
bit
on
the
light
side
of
medium
not
for
the
smoke
averse
not
as
much
depth
re
caramel
as
the
marzen
version
but
a
great
smelling
and
tasting
beer
nonetheless
worth
seeking
out
for
all
the
smoky
joes
out
there
o
not
nearly
as
strong
flavored
as
i
thought
it
would
be
nothing
great
although
i
was
actually
expecting
not
to
like
it
so
it
worked
out
this
is
something
ill
have
every
now
and
again
pours

leaves

light
for
me
with
tastes
of
toffeemarzipancandied
peachesa
light
touch
of
smoke
and
the
finish
is
nutty
and
fruity
and
overall
its
nice
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
bit
more
cheers
medium
bodied
this
beer
rolls
smooth
over
the
tongue
carbonation
is
low
but
that
is
no
issue
here
consumed
from
an
aecht
schlenkerla
pint
glass
this
doppelbock
may
not
be
quite
to
style
but
it
adds
to
a
comfortable
cool
late
afternoon
o
tasty
beer
im
always
surprised
by
how
much
i
love
schlenkerlas
beers
they
do
amazing
things
with
their
smoked
flavors
im
going
to
now
finish
the
last
bit
of
my
drink
and
enjoy
every
second
the
bronze
colored
body
was
clear
and
the
head
that
formed
was
a
very
small
ring
of
bubbles
while
the
looks
were
quite
timid
for
a
doppelbock
the
smell
was
anything
but
the
smoked
bamberg
malts
were
prominent
and
gave
this
beer
a
smoky
sweet
aroma
evocative
of
pork
ribs
the
taste
continue
the
theme
of
the
smell
with
a
real
smoke
laden
flavor
backed
by
good
deal
of
sweetness
the
hops
were
there
in
the
finish
but
only
provided
a
restrained
drying
note
instead
of
an
overt
bitterness
the
sticky
and
smooth
feel
on
the
palette
and
a
drawn
out
smoky
finish
that
ended
each
sip
were
both
very
classy
the
smoked
malts
seem
to
do
very
well
in
a
dopplebock
style
now
please
brew
a
trippelbock
like
samichlaus
with
these
this
is
one
of
the
rauchiest
beers
ive
tried
to
date
pretty
good
if
you
can
handle
the
smoke
schlenkerla
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
so
i
am
excited
to
try
this
offering
for
the
first
time
pours
a
dark
brownish
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
filled
with
smoke
and
malts
it
honestly
smells
like
smoked
meats
the
aromas
with
this
brewery
are
amazing
if
you
love
smoke
the
taste
is
smooth
malty
sweet
and
deliciously
smokey
with
some
hops
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
another
fine
offering
from
this
great
brewery
could
this
really
be
a
new
schlenkerla
i
only
remember
ever
seeing
3
varieties
of
their
rauchbier
and
this
one
claims
to
be
a
doppelbock
as
well
very
exciting
16
9
oz
bottle
as
soon
as
i
crack
it
the
smell
is
unmistakably
smoke
just
like
smoked
gouda
flavor
is
dead
on
as
well
slightly
sweet
not
too
bitter
the
way
the
beer
falls
into
the
glass
it
looks
over
carbonated
big
bubbles
no
head
but
in
the
mouth
its
just
right
very
smooth
the
smoke
flavor
is
not
at
all
tiring
or
abrasive
and
while
it
does
have
some
lagery
qualities
i
never
would
have
guessed
this
is
a
doppelbock
or
the
associated
alcohol
content
alas
the
beer
doesnt
have
much
else
going
for
it
and
maybe
its
a
little
gimmicky
but
what
there
is
is
amazing
a
wonderful
rauchbier
overall
good
as
an
occasional
beer
due
to
the
uniqueness
far
from
a
complex
multilayered
masterpiece
but
thats
not
how
its
advertised
either
o
beers
like
this
with
smoked
ingredients
are
good
every
once
in
a
while
but
they
arent
something
id
drink
all
the
time
still
a
well
done
beer
o
just
like
their
brilliant
rauchbiers
yet
sweeter
o
with
most
smoked
beers
i
find
that
that
the
smoked
scenttaste
overwhelms
every
other
aspect
of
the
beer
in
essence
its
like
drinking
a
smoked
pig
fortunately
this
beer
rises
above
that
silly
preconception
and
offers
something
more
for
the
drinker
a
nice
doppelbock
combined
with
some
smoky
flavours
and
delivering
a
satisfying
overall
feel
that
overwhelming
sweetness
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
am
a
big
fan
of
smoky
flavors
in
tea
and
scotch
whiskey
so
i
was
optimistic
that
id
be
a
big
fan
but
im
sorry
to
say
im
disappointed
overall
one
of
the
more
unique
beers
i
have
enjoyed
first
time
i
had
beer
that
made
me
think
of
and
desire
bbq
ribs
good
overall
but
probably
wouldnt
purchase
again
o
now
i
found
a
beer
that
is
even
worse
than
a
sour
one
this
is
not
my
kind
of
thing
i
stopped
smoking
85
years
ago
and
this
beer
tastes
like
i
have
started
again
this
beer
still
get
some
points
for
the
doppelbock
undertone
which
is
is
undoubtedly
nice
and
wonderful
o
another
amazing
offering
from
schlenkerla
the
cantillon
of
smoked
beer
rich
smoky
and
sweet
with
that
signature
schlenkerla
smoke
profile
i
love
this
stuff
o
very
unusual
and
very
enjoyable
the
smokeyness
really
adds
another
dimension
much
lighter
than
the
other
schlenkerlas
a
dark
caramel
beer
with
a
weak
off
white
head
but
my
glass
wasnt
immaculately
clean
so
ill
give
this
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
aroma
is
smooth
and
mellow
but
strong
and
meaty
lovely
notes
of
sweet
barbecue
char
fruity
kalamata
olive
rich
oaken
vanilla
maple
leaves
and
apple
hum
a
rich
enticing
autumnal
harmony
smooth
on
the
tongue
as
well
with
a
smoke
flavor
thats
sweet
rich
and
dominant
but
not
overpowering
allowing
pleasantly
rich
fruit
and
caramel
flavors
in
along
with
a
nice
slap
of
bitter
green
noble
hops
the
mouthfeel
falls
a
bit
short
with
a
pleasant
tingle
but
a
lack
of
body
that
doesnt
carry
the
flavor
and
allows
the
raw
alcohol
flavor
to
intrude
quite
a
nice
beer
though
and
one
id
love
to
try
with
cheese
or
chocolate
very
smooth
and
mellow
with
a
nice
smoky
flavor
great
sipper
carbonation
is
medium
mouthfeel
is
full
but
not
too
sweet
a
very
enjoyable
rauchbier
that
i
could
drink
multiple
pints
of
in
a
sitting
a
nice
smokey
sweet
brew
not
the
most
bockish
dopplebock
that
i
have
had
but
the
smoke
makes
the
beer
overall
i
think
if
i
lived
in
bamburg
id
like
this
but
growing
up
in
canada
and
not
being
exposed
to
this
very
often
i
really
dont
have
a
big
fondness
for
this
style
of
beer
however
it
is
incredibly
interesting
and
probably
better
than
the
regular
aecht
schlenkerla
i
love
the
smoke
flavors
from
aecht
this
carries
it
through
very
well
along
with
excellent
flavors
on
both
the
aromas
and
feel
o
very
well
crafted
its
a
little
strong
as
bocks
are
intended
to
be
but
the
high
alcohol
makes
it
a
little
bit
overwhelming
in
many
ways
sweetness
alcoholic
warmth
etc
works
great
in
winter
times
for
sure
o
a
very
nice
smoked
doppelbock
that
is
an
exceptional
beer
everythings
good
about
this
beer
but
im
looking
at
the
10
oz
left
in
my
glass
wondering
how
the
hell
im
going
to
finish
this
dont
estimate
this
its
a
rich
full
beer
that
kind
of
tricked
me
at
first
ive
reached
my
saturation
point
pretty
shortly
in
good
but
best
to
split
drinkability
incredible
this
is
all
i
want
for
christmas
another
quality
beer
from
this
brewery
not
really
that
different
from
their
other
beers
d
a
good
drinker
the
doppelback
flavor
is
lost
in
the
smoke
and
the
appearance
was
average
still
a
good
drink
the
booze
made
this
feel
much
stronger
than
it
actually
was
and
if
i
wanted
a
fermented
ham
and
cheese
sandwich
id
crack
this
open
and
be
thankful
that
i
dont
have
to
go
about
making
one
the
hard
way
the
smokiness
is
a
lot
to
take
but
like
so
many
beers
ive
had
before
this
can
warm
up
if
the
person
drinking
it
has
an
open
mind
and
patience
this
isnt
for
everyone
but
theres
enough
here
to
like
after
the
initial
shock
wears
off
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
some
yeast
sediment
head
is
large
and
frothy
when
poured
complex
aroma
of
oak
smoke
from
the
malts
used
and
beech
smoke
aroma
from
the
kettles
and
vessels
used
in
brewing
in
the
taste
bacony
campfire
cured
meats
and
char
some
buttery
diacetyl
is
noted
as
a
byproduct
of
the
yeast
hints
of
a
small
malt
sweetness
and
bitterness
but
both
are
cut
by
acrid
smoke
flavors
not
as
sweet
as
your
typical
doppelbock
alcohol
is
felt
not
tasted
in
the
finish
smoke
chalky
yeast
and
slick
on
the
palatte
another
fine
smoke
beer
from
aecht
schlenkerla
hazy
yeasty
beer
in
color
with
very
small
head
smells
of
grilled
meats
with
slight
oak
it
tasted
of
a
wheat
with
lots
of
malt
a
good
strong
smoke
taste
with
slight
oak
it
was
pretty
much
a
full
bodied
beer
but
a
very
drinkable
smoke
beer
compare
to
their
marzen
o
cant
help
but
give
this
a
5
overall
simply
blew
any
smoked
beers
ive
had
previously
out
of
the
water
at
such
a
great
price
ill
be
sure
to
pick
more
of
this
up
overall
this
is
another
great
smokebeer
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
the
foaming
and
chunkies
but
ultimately
the
taste
and
aroma
won
me
over
o
great
beer
expensive
516oz
bottle
but
well
worth
the
experience
look
forward
to
having
again
so
good
sorry
but
i
just
couldnt
get
paste
out
of
my
mind
and
that
definitely
affected
my
feelings
of
this
beer
although
i
had
a
bad
reaction
to
the
smell
the
taste
wasnt
bad
it
wasnt
great
but
it
was
interesting
to
say
the
least
im
surprised
this
came
from
germany
if
i
had
to
guess
without
knowing
who
made
it
id
have
said
rogue
because
of
the
super
strong
smokiness
i
appreciate
what
they
are
trying
to
do
i
just
wish
i
had
it
with
some
barbeque
as
i
think
it
would
make
a
great
pairing
gotta
give
it
to
them
for
hiding
the
8
so
well
too
i
wouldnt
necessarily
buy
it
again
but
it
was
an
interesting
experience
i
love
smoke
beers
and
i
have
to
say
that
the
ones
from
schlenkera
are
probably
the
best
examples
made
just
perfect
for
a
fall
evening
pours
a
rusty
orange
brown
with
a
nice
dense
cap
of
just
offwhite
head
creamy
and
thick
retention
solid
lacing
some
floaties
in
the
body
there
was
a
bunch
of
yeast
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
that
i
only
poured
a
portion
of
into
the
glass
nose
is
typical
schlenkerla
smoke
campfire
and
charcoal
with
some
caramel
and
leathery
notes
taste
is
sublime
loads
of
caramel
dark
fruits
and
sweet
malts
smoke
is
direct
and
of
greater
intensity
than
the
nose
but
doesnt
stay
on
the
palate
for
long
smoke
reappears
in
the
finish
and
there
only
a
slight
unpleasant
bitternessdryness
that
sets
this
back
from
perfection
mouthfeel
is
medium
heavy
carbonation
is
a
magnificent
medium
low
wow
did
not
expect
to
be
this
blow
away
opening
this
on
a
tuesday
evening
exceptional
and
i
can
only
imagine
this
being
just
a
tad
closer
to
perfection
on
cask
in
bamberg
brilliant
and
god
do
i
love
smoked
beers
very
nice
dopple
that
screams
bamberg
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
again
but
glad
i
tried
it
overall
amazing
beer
i
was
really
overwhelmed
by
just
how
smokey
this
was
i
will
most
certainly
be
having
more
beers
from
this
brewery
dr
actually
very
drinkable
and
not
just
for
the
abv
its
more
drinkable
than
their
marzen
which
i
didnt
expect
a
good
quality
beer
its
only
flaw
its
simplicity
in
the
style
i
believe
its
among
the
best
ive
had
500
ml
bottle
poured
into
a
dimpled
eichhof
mug
tips
the
scales
at
no
darker
than
bronze
with
a
solid
khaki
head
luscious
smokey
aroma
recalling
smoldering
bonfires
and
smoked
cheese
especially
not
quite
as
meaty
as
the
other
schlenkerla
offerings
flavor
is
smooth
and
salty
plenty
of
hambacon
notes
wood
black
coffee
fire
an
excellent
smoked
beer
full
and
nourishing
on
the
palate
overall
a
very
pleasant
rauchbier
not
sure
why
this
one
is
filed
as
a
doppelbock
instead
o
this
is
a
disappointing
one
for
me
and
i
do
wonder
if
its
been
subject
to
the
elements
i
would
go
to
their
urbock
over
this
beer
any
day
of
the
week
it
seems
to
carry
few
things
which
i
associate
with
its
doppelbock
style
so
smooth
yet
so
intense
liquid
smoke
meets
sweet
malts
and
a
kiss
of
alcohol
body
is
light
and
i
think
that
helps
not
make
it
too
heavyfeeling
of
a
brew
pretty
amazing
brew
and
after
a
couple
schlenkerla
brews
that
were
not
as
smoky
as
urbock
this
one
is
damn
smoky
and
enjoyable
love
it
pours
a
murky
light
brown
with
a
1
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
there
is
really
no
lacing
on
this
one
though
smell
is
obviously
of
smoked
cheese
smoked
meat
smoked
wood
campfire
smoke
etc
taste
is
of
the
same
but
its
not
as
potent
as
other
aecht
schlenkerla
beers
with
the
smoke
flavors
this
is
actually
very
pleasant
especially
since
i
love
smoked
meat
and
cheese
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
thick
mouthfeel
can
the
smoke
do
this
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
much
tamer
than
the
other
rauchbier
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
o
dont
know
how
much
of
this
i
could
drink
in
a
night
but
one
or
two
glasses
of
this
are
a
game
changer
steve
and
i
were
lucky
enough
to
have
tried
this
on
draft
a
couple
times
earlier
this
year
and
i
was
thrilled
when
he
brought
this
guy
over
16
9
ounce
500
ml
bottle
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
dark
goldenamber
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
the
head
sticks
around
for
a
little
while
but
there
isnt
much
lacing
at
all
aroma
is
very
smoky
the
brew
smells
mostly
like
smoked
meat
along
with
a
bit
of
bready
malt
i
just
love
the
smoky
meaty
aroma
of
this
brew
the
beer
tastes
like
smoked
meat
bready
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
caramel
theres
also
a
nice
lingering
smoky
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
coating
and
has
moderate
carbonation
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
overall
brew
for
just
4
99
a
bottle
id
definitely
buy
this
again
its
certainly
one
of
the
better
if
not
the
best
smoked
beers
ive
had
this
beer
is
delicious
if
the
rating
doesnt
sell
you
on
it
then
youre
stupid
just
try
the
beer
i
love
smoked
beers
and
schlenkerla
does
them
better
than
anyone
on
the
planet
this
particular
beer
is
one
of
the
top
smoked
beers
ive
ever
had
its
bigger
and
more
complex
than
most
and
has
the
absolutely
unmistakable
schlenkerla
character
everyone
should
try
this
beer
but
smoked
beer
lovers
have
to
get
their
hands
on
this
one
beer
pours
a
dark
straw
with
no
head
but
this
delicious
smoke
aroma
taste
is
like
a
honey
baked
ham
the
smoke
lingers
on
the
palate
and
the
smokiness
comes
back
in
the
finish
not
as
pronounced
a
smoke
profile
as
some
of
the
other
beers
ive
had
in
this
series
this
dobblebock
is
like
a
dessert
to
a
smoked
main
course
d
this
is
superb
the
smoke
doesnt
dominate
its
everpresent
but
doesnt
get
in
the
way
of
the
malt
richness
of
the
doppelbock
character
lager
clean
finish
makes
it
easily
drinkable
with
no
suggestion
of
its
alcohol
strength
a
rich
doppelbock
with
that
classic
schlenkerla
rauch
flavour
superb
dave
overall
nothing
really
wowed
me
and
ill
say
i
like
the
urbock
better
dont
get
me
wrong
though
its
still
a
great
beer
d
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
smoke
beer
it
wasnt
as
intense
from
the
bottle
as
on
tap
but
it
still
had
a
great
woody
scent
and
taste
that
was
amazingly
clean
without
any
harshness
it
had
great
body
too
with
no
alcohol
noticeable
so
it
was
really
easy
to
drink
probably
not
for
aging
but
who
knows
how
it
might
develop
over
time
highly
recommended
o
im
enjoying
this
smoked
beer
not
to
heavy
good
after
taste
excellent
flavor
it
is
yet
another
new
beer
into
my
world
that
will
open
my
eyes
even
wider
for
new
stuff
id
love
to
purchase
again
different
yet
intriguing
smoky
but
not
yet
a
rather
smooth
doppel
liking
how
the
smoked
malts
balance
the
sweetness
even
in
the
absence
of
an
aggressive
hopping
overall
this
is
a
real
treat
definitely
different
than
most
beers
due
to
the
domination
of
the
smoked
wood
in
the
smell
and
taste
but
masterfully
done
overall
this
is
a
nice
approachable
smoked
beer
it
is
tasty
but
hard
core
smoked
beer
fans
might
be
wish
for
a
bit
more
here
but
thats
no
slight
on
this
one
this
is
very
solid
m
the
mouthfeel
is
sweet
chewy
and
meaty
one
square
meal
in
liquid
form
the
smoked
oak
adds
complexity
and
richness
world
class
overall
a
good
smoked
doppelbock
with
an
incredible
aroma
overall
its
pretty
tasty
but
the
smoke
really
is
a
lot
to
handle
be
ready
i
did
not
finish
the
beer
another
home
run
from
schlenkerla
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
little
watery
in
my
opinion
while
the
body
is
great
as
you
hold
it
in
your
mouth
it
is
swallowed
like
a
heavy
water
and
leaves
little
coating
a
stickier
mouthfeel
would
have
helped
this
beers
flavor
profile
immensely
a
very
savory
and
succulently
flavored
smoked
dopplebock
that
relies
on
malt
sweetness
to
balance
the
smoke
avoiding
ashy
or
roast
the
beer
carries
a
more
meaty
character
thats
very
appealing
in
a
beef
jerky
kind
of
way
i
was
really
excited
when
i
came
across
this
beer
at
my
local
shop
i
thought
that
i
had
tried
all
the
different
ones
they
had
until
i
was
proven
wrong
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
dark
brown
color
the
head
was
big
at
first
but
quickly
settles
and
almost
fades
completely
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
smokey
but
it
seems
like
it
was
a
tolerable
aroma
than
their
others
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
loaded
with
smokey
malts
and
some
fresh
wood
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
drinkable
and
not
really
heavy
at
all
overall
this
beer
was
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
from
aecht
if
you
like
burned
wood
and
massive
smokey
character
this
beer
is
for
you
i
feel
it
is
way
undercarbonated
may
have
a
decent
malt
backbone
but
is
just
not
hitting
high
marks
with
me
i
like
some
good
smoked
oak
etc
age
and
unique
character
but
holy
smokes
o
interesting
and
quite
good
still
i
wouldnt
drink
this
every
day
but
id
have
it
again
especially
if
im
ever
in
the
mood
for
a
doppelbock
delightlfully
effervescent
in
the
mouth
with
a
mediumlight
body
definitely
a
rocksolid
smoked
beer
and
probably
one
of
the
more
dominantly
defined
beers
from
schlenkerla
packs
a
onetwo
punch
of
both
smoke
and
hops
while
maintaining
a
clever
balance
with
some
truly
delicious
malts
no
doubt
a
wellcrafted
smoked
beer
overall
for
a
lover
of
rauchbier
such
as
myself
a
16
9
oz
bottle
is
too
small
two
would
be
better
well
worth
seeking
out
overall
this
was
a
rather
delicious
and
well
balanced
rauch
personally
ham
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
meats
of
the
pork
persuasion
so
i
probably
wont
be
buying
this
again
i
cant
knock
it
for
that
though
and
the
dryer
finish
gives
this
one
a
few
extra
points
o
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
the
flavor
is
great
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
over
the
course
of
a
night
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
and
unique
version
of
the
style
i
really
like
how
the
nose
has
a
nice
big
smoke
presence
but
it
tones
down
in
the
actual
flavor
of
the
beer
i
think
this
is
great
beer
and
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
i
recommend
giving
it
a
shot
you
will
taste
the
oak
you
will
taste
delicious
smoke
if
you
like
smoked
beers
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
brew
for
a
taste
of
how
magical
oak
smoke
can
be
most
other
smoked
beers
are
beechwood
and
not
oak
im
told
by
the
label
blurb
thick
rich
malts
and
tons
of
smokey
bacon
flavors
i
would
seriously
say
that
this
is
just
a
bacon
flavored
beer
it
has
the
smokey
essence
of
a
camp
fire
and
is
nice
and
sweet
i
must
say
that
i
was
not
expecting
this
beer
to
be
the
way
it
is
at
all
i
have
never
had
a
doppelbock
quite
like
it
overall
pretty
good
drinkable
much
more
smooth
and
mild
than
the
urbock
or
marzen
i
think
drinkable
and
nice
smoke
qualities
di
guess
this
style
just
isnt
for
me
i
have
a
bottle
of
their
marzen
that
ill
try
to
see
if
this
one
was
off
a
little
d
fair
to
good
this
is
a
big
tasty
beer
i
cannot
imagine
reaching
for
a
second
one
of
these
it
really
makes
me
want
to
go
camping
3
5
drinkability
awesome
and
great
for
pairing
with
foods
are
treat
and
a
honor
to
try
i
had
3
glasses
o
not
the
best
for
my
taste
but
i
can
appreciate
both
the
doppelbock
aspect
as
well
as
the
rauchbier
so
it
is
quite
successful
in
that
regard
o
really
an
interesting
beer
ive
had
a
few
truly
smoked
beers
and
this
one
takes
the
cake
intense
and
a
bit
hard
to
down
for
22oz
of
cured
smoke
enjoyed
it
but
would
rather
sample
next
time
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
overall
and
maybe
a
little
light
for
what
i
like
in
the
style
carbonation
is
low
and
seems
appropriate
overall
it
was
a
very
smoky
beer
definitely
one
of
the
smokiest
beers
ive
had
i
really
liked
how
the
oak
wood
came
out
i
really
like
smoky
beers
so
this
one
was
a
nice
treat
this
evening
it
would
definitely
be
an
intense
beer
for
someone
just
getting
into
the
style
though
remarkably
smooth
easydrinking
smoked
the
smoke
is
there
but
its
understated
under
a
delicious
malt
mix
its
on
my
lips
well
after
i
have
completed
it
it
was
great
with
bbq
greyish
golden
coloured
body
small
head
mild
smoke
aromas
a
tad
above
average
mouthfeel
o
another
fantastic
schlenkerla
brew
the
balance
between
the
stunning
malt
complexity
and
smokey
depth
is
just
wonderful
wish
i
had
a
liter
in
front
of
me
right
now
it
pours
a
light
orangishred
with
a
small
head
that
dissipated
quickly
i
took
a
sniff
and
there
was
a
smell
of
smoked
malts
which
almost
smelled
of
a
smoked
gouda
cheese
the
taste
was
quite
complex
there
was
a
taste
of
the
smokiness
like
a
smoked
cheeseoaky
flavor
that
was
then
surpassed
with
a
sweeter
aftertaste
of
fruits
and
brown
sugar
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
a
full
body
and
heavy
beer
like
most
rauchbeirs
there
is
light
carbonation
there
is
also
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
but
it
does
weigh
in
at
8
abv
overall
this
rauchbeir
is
probably
at
the
top
of
my
list
of
rauchbeirs
i
can
only
drink
one
or
2
of
these
bottles
and
then
feel
full
if
you
are
into
rauchbeirs
get
this
around
christmas
or
whenever
you
can
find
this
one
bought
this
rauchbier
from
the
beer
dispensery
in
apex
nc
my
ba
buddy
y2korey
and
i
broke
one
open
in
may
2011
damn
i
love
the
rauchbiers
this
beer
has
a
nice
golden
amber
hue
its
nose
is
like
a
fresh
burning
campfire
that
pours
over
into
the
taste
as
you
drink
it
down
mouthfeel
is
slightly
better
than
average
and
i
feel
that
this
rauchbier
goes
down
easy
for
having
an
abv
of
8
o
im
a
big
fan
the
higher
abv
gives
this
rauchbier
a
depth
and
force
of
flavour
that
the
morepopular
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
märzen
doesnt
have
multidimensional
but
always
smoky
recommended
drinkability
and
overall
impression
i
found
this
one
more
drinkable
that
i
had
expected
at
first
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
somewhat
simple
and
only
about
the
smoke
but
as
i
had
more
and
as
the
beer
warmed
the
flavors
became
more
complex
and
more
interesting
while
ill
not
make
a
great
effort
to
find
this
one
again
i
certainly
would
be
happy
to
have
another
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
well
made
beer
deserving
of
close
attention
that
requires
one
to
look
beyond
the
smoke
and
taking
some
time
with
the
beer
to
discover
the
complexity
that
shows
up
here
with
the
smoke
intense
yet
not
overpowering
drinkability
was
good
not
hard
to
put
away
and
overall
a
shining
smoked
dopplebock
example
o
a
nice
beer
but
as
a
doppelbock
im
not
sure
way
to
much
smoke
the
grade
would
have
been
higher
if
i
reviewed
it
as
a
rauchbier
still
very
interesting
not
as
good
as
their
standard
lineup
i
felt
but
still
a
pretty
good
meaty
smoke
d
being
a
sucker
for
rauchbiers
i
am
loving
this
a
beefed
up
doppelversion
of
a
smoked
lager
just
so
much
aromaflavor
from
the
smoke
makes
this
very
enjoyable
maybe
not
the
best
beer
to
start
your
palate
with
but
a
great
beer
overall
o
this
was
a
tough
beer
for
me
to
drink
i
could
not
finish
a
full
beer
as
it
was
like
drinking
a
burnt
piece
of
oak
if
this
is
your
style
then
id
think
youd
be
happy
as
with
anything
from
schlenkerla
this
is
akin
to
drinking
a
burning
log
however
its
not
as
smoky
as
other
beer
from
this
brewery
the
urbock
is
zillions
of
times
smokier
and
for
that
matter
hammier
nonetheless
this
one
has
plenty
of
smoke
theres
no
ham
however
so
i
guess
that
makes
it
kosher
quite
tasty
and
rather
lowkey
for
a
dopplebock
it
doesnt
have
the
boozy
malty
smack
that
most
others
in
this
style
have
thats
a
plus
in
my
book
because
its
that
overtly
alcoholic
tinge
that
steers
me
away
from
most
dopplebocks
if
youre
a
fan
of
schlenkerla
you
must
try
this
but
if
you
like
your
dopplebocks
sweet
and
powerful
you
are
not
worthy
summary
this
is
a
fantastic
smoked
dopplebock
that
is
almost
sessionable
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
a
smoked
beer
though
nonplused
about
the
assertion
that
this
is
a
doppelbock
i
like
my
doppelbocks
dark
chewy
and
sweet
and
bready
nevertheless
definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
and
cheap
at
2
99
for
the
bottle
a
premium
example
of
a
smoky
satisfying
malty
german
doppelbock
excellent
in
nearly
every
respect
rich
strong
smoked
malts
dominated
the
aroma
and
were
substantially
comnplemented
on
the
palate
a
musttry
for
anyone
a
fan
of
the
style
highly
recommended
great
stuff
d
i
love
all
their
other
beers
but
this
beer
has
bitterness
and
over
the
top
smoke
dominating
the
flavor
making
it
almost
undrinkable
there
needs
to
be
some
other
support
at
least
a
bit
and
the
woody
bandaid
notes
mixed
with
the
bitter
green
finish
just
hang
on
the
tongue
t
that
schlenkerla
smokiness
certainly
comes
through
this
is
lovely
smooth
with
an
oak
taste
there
is
a
mild
sweetness
underneath
perhaps
a
caramel
taste
perfectly
balanced
some
bitterness
dont
forget
to
stamp
your
passport
finishing
the
bottle
you
genuinely
have
the
sensation
of
having
experienced
something
unique
and
distinctly
rooted
in
a
certain
landscape
and
history
ive
had
some
wonderful
smoked
beers
but
none
honestly
capture
the
distinct
character
of
schlenkerla
rauchbiers
especially
not
this
offering
buy
a
bottle
drink
up
prepare
yourself
for
one
of
the
most
distinctive
beers
youre
bound
to
try
id
say
this
is
my
favorite
dopplebock
as
of
right
now
there
i
said
it
taste
is
wood
smoke
caramelized
sweet
bread
crust
up
front
hint
of
spicyraisiny
fruitiness
lingering
spicy
smokiness
just
dominates
finish
lingers
its
pretty
good
but
a
bit
onedimensional
and
slightly
sharp
again
love
this
brewery
this
is
much
more
drinkable
and
palatable
than
their
regual
run
dont
know
if
its
the
oak
aging
making
the
overall
smokiness
more
rounded
and
laid
back
or
if
its
just
this
beer
but
whatever
it
is
its
damn
tasty
burnt
caramel
oak
charred
woods
smoked
meats
brown
sugar
some
dried
fig
on
the
very
finish
creamy
nice
mouth
with
a
medium
sweet
finish
that
than
ends
dryly
quite
good
i
know
that
i
am
biased
i
love
smoked
beer
schlenkerla
urbock
is
one
of
my
favorite
all
time
beers
so
i
was
excited
to
try
this
one
pours
a
dark
but
translucent
brown
with
a
medium
head
lots
of
wood
some
meaty
goodness
and
tons
of
smoke
in
the
nose
i
love
the
way
these
beers
smell
and
this
was
no
exception
tasted
of
wood
and
smoke
as
well
as
bacon
but
not
as
intense
as
the
smell
a
slight
sweetness
marries
with
the
smoke
perfectly
and
goes
beautifully
with
food
smoked
german
sausage
in
this
lucky
mans
case
smooth
and
rich
on
the
palate
but
also
light
and
fluffy
as
it
does
not
leave
any
intense
flavors
in
the
mouth
over
all
a
great
beer
that
i
will
have
again
but
may
not
love
as
much
as
the
urbock
d
a
very
attractive
and
balanced
smoke
beer
it
tastes
completely
natural
and
has
a
sort
of
rustic
charm
that
i
find
quite
appealing
quite
full
bodied
but
not
heavy
nice
rounded
mouthfeel
but
mostly
firm
a
nice
change
of
pace
o
i
think
its
pretty
easy
to
see
where
i
stand
with
this
beer
and
like
all
schlenkerla
beers
i
love
it
even
though
the
abv
is
a
bit
higher
than
the
rest
of
the
line
up
i
cant
help
but
to
keep
on
getting
sips
of
this
stuff
if
you
like
smoked
beers
this
is
a
beer
that
you
should
hunt
down
to
try
md
could
have
used
a
bit
more
carbonation
overall
it
was
very
good
but
needed
just
a
little
more
bite
to
the
mouthfeel
notes
interesting
complex
smoked
beer
smoked
meat
is
the
strongest
but
this
more
than
other
similar
beers
provides
more
balance
and
complexity
to
the
flavor
has
subtlevague
doppelbock
hints
as
well
as
oak
pours
a
clearish
dark
goldtan
color
with
decent
carbonation
and
head
aroma
is
smokey
and
meaty
not
much
else
i
like
this
beer
and
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
after
dinner
sipper
for
me
and
it
is
a
sipper
chug
this
only
if
you
want
to
be
ill
just
slightly
disappointed
only
in
that
while
a
medium
body
and
i
can
pick
out
some
sweet
malt
tastes
and
a
touch
of
hoppy
bitterness
this
is
mostly
a
smoke
beer
nothing
wrong
with
that
just
that
this
is
not
close
to
a
5050
balance
of
rauchdopple
the
smokiness
is
clearly
more
dominant
if
you
love
smoke
beers
with
a
touch
of
lingering
sweetness
then
this
is
yours
but
beware
if
you
think
youre
getting
a
slightly
smoked
dopplebock
perhaps
my
hope
for
the
latter
leads
to
my
review
being
less
than
a
solid
a
as
i
like
smoke
beers
and
in
that
case
this
is
another
top
notch
aecht
brew
that
being
said
a
sturdy
fullerbodied
beer
that
is
exceptionally
smooth
thanks
to
oak
and
has
a
touch
of
woodiness
in
it
smooths
as
it
warms
and
the
longer
you
sip
on
it
your
tongue
adjusts
to
dry
smokiness
and
caramel
toffee
sticky
malts
and
some
minor
hop
flavors
come
through
behind
smoke
i
really
enjoy
smoked
beer
and
this
one
was
no
exception
the
beer
is
a
clear
light
chestnut
color
with
a
modest
white
head
the
aroma
is
what
catches
you
first
its
a
great
mix
of
wood
smoke
and
rich
malt
the
smoke
is
intense
something
between
a
smoked
ham
and
a
smoldering
campfire
the
malt
is
folded
in
behind
the
smoke
but
still
quite
prominent
as
for
the
taste
its
a
sweet
malty
dopplebock
for
sure
the
smoke
comes
forth
in
the
taste
as
a
remarkable
spiciness
firm
body
and
very
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
while
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
it
is
the
work
of
craftsman
brewers
both
smoke
and
dopple
bock
beers
are
very
difficult
beers
to
brew
and
this
is
a
great
combination
of
the
two
1316
o
aecht
doesnt
disappoint
and
this
is
not
an
overwhelming
beer
the
right
amount
of
smoke
and
malt
makes
for
a
drinkable
wonderful
beer
o
goes
down
easily
at
first
tasty
not
too
filling
well
hidden
kick
and
a
bit
off
for
a
dopplebock
its
more
of
a
smoked
dopplebock
at
first
the
smokiness
is
fantastic
but
as
the
beer
warms
the
sweetness
and
minor
alcohol
notes
come
in
and
hang
a
little
too
sweet
to
have
more
of
a
pint
of
but
a
decent
beer
nonetheless
this
beer
pours
a
murky
orangeamber
color
the
head
is
a
half
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
smoke
wood
bacon
and
caramel
it
is
a
strong
aroma
the
taste
is
quite
a
bit
mellower
than
the
aroma
there
is
still
a
strong
smoke
presence
especially
in
the
finish
but
it
is
balanced
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
rauchbier
that
i
would
gladly
drink
again
beers
like
this
stand
as
a
refutation
of
any
sentiment
that
german
brewing
is
irrelevant
or
obsolete
schlenkeria
oak
smoke
is
an
exciting
and
amazingly
well
crafted
beer
i
dont
see
how
one
could
balance
such
bold
flavors
without
hours
of
work
researching
and
brewing
im
not
entirely
sold
on
the
style
but
im
glad
theres
adventurous
beers
like
this
being
made
so
well
o
overall
i
really
dont
think
this
is
my
cup
of
tea
i
just
cant
get
warmed
up
to
the
idea
of
drinking
a
glass
of
bacon
as
either
a
rauchbier
or
a
doppelbock
this
one
is
really
easy
to
drink
not
thick
great
complex
flavors
and
those
unique
schlenkerla
aromas
make
this
a
fun
one
to
review
this
is
a
complex
beer
although
the
sweet
and
smoked
flavors
dominate
extremely
enjoyable
i
love
this
brewerys
consistency
and
integration
of
the
smoked
malt
into
all
their
beers
being
a
fan
of
raucbiers
i
knew
that
i
would
love
eiche
but
what
i
didnt
expect
was
how
this
beer
would
touch
and
tease
my
palate
wow
this
might
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
during
lent
or
fuck
it
how
bout
everyday
the
500
ml
bottle
went
down
much
quicker
than
expected
and
being
a
seasonal
beer
im
sure
to
grab
at
least
a
few
more
bottles
before
the
supply
runs
dry
this
beer
is
hard
to
drink
for
me
the
taste
does
not
appeal
to
me
very
unusual
d
its
certainly
unique
ill
give
it
that
but
its
really
hard
to
drink
in
any
significant
amount
easier
drinking
than
some
of
their
other
offerings
but
still
smoky
and
tasty
verdict
too
expensive
to
be
worth
it
and
too
unique
to
be
an
everyday
beer
really
a
novelty
only
drinkability
an
excellent
rauchbier
and
a
decent
doppelbock
schlenkerlas
offerings
are
always
unique
and
intriguing
this
one
is
no
different
its
smoky
character
goes
a
long
way
towards
hiding
the
8
abv
which
makes
this
beer
a
bit
more
quaffable
than
most
doppelbocks
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
certainly
something
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
soon
d
this
beer
probably
has
the
perfect
amount
of
smoke
often
i
find
the
smokiness
of
rauchbier
to
be
too
subtle
getting
lost
after
a
few
sips
this
beer
keeps
reminding
me
in
a
good
way
holy
absolutely
amazing
smoke
intensity
heavy
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
malt
characteristics
just
enough
to
set
it
off
i
love
rauchbier
so
im
a
bit
biased
but
this
one
is
my
new
favorite
another
wonderful
offering
from
a
worldclass
brewer
dan
exceellent
beer
but
im
not
sure
how
many
i
could
handle
medium
body
carbonation
is
smooth
some
warming
alcohol
but
not
enough
to
hurt
the
drinkability
smoke
adds
a
great
complexity
to
this
i
love
the
schlenkerla
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
this
is
so
far
the
most
highest
rated
beer
ive
ever
rated
thank
god
i
seeked
it
out
it
is
truly
world
class
and
phenomenal
if
you
find
the
regular
rauchbiers
too
smokey
marzen
or
too
sweet
urbock
drink
this
thing
its
the
perfect
marriage
the
head
mashes
my
face
and
surrounds
my
nose
cause
it
will
not
leave
me
alone
whisking
me
to
another
world
as
the
perfect
sweet
body
and
taste
envelopes
me
out
of
this
glass
i
want
more
i
am
very
tempted
to
rate
this
as
all
fives
i
am
shocked
i
never
thought
this
beer
would
be
this
good
or
any
beer
for
that
matter
drinkability
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
one
that
i
would
like
to
have
again
fantastic
this
is
the
rauchbier
to
start
with
if
you
could
find
it
incredibly
smooth
and
delicious
this
is
a
beer
to
try
if
you
can
find
it
overall
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
drank
it
fairly
quick
one
of
the
tastier
more
balanced
rauchbiers
ive
had
hope
they
put
this
out
for
years
to
come
d
much
higher
than
other
rauchbiers
this
is
just
as
drinkable
as
any
other
doppelbock
ive
had
helles
or
otherwise
this
is
unique
and
something
i
think
i
would
crave
now
and
then
but
you
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
d
another
spectacular
release
from
one
of
my
most
cherished
breweries
this
is
something
different
but
still
on
base
with
the
brewers
former
lineup
highly
recommended
d
well
with
all
rauchbiers
theres
a
sort
of
limit
to
drinkability
this
is
overwhelmingly
smoky
which
i
adore
and
others
loathe
if
you
love
the
taste
this
is
worth
seeking
out
otherwise
its
not
much
milder
than
any
other
offering
from
these
guys
and
probably
a
terrible
beer
for
those
new
to
the
style
it
drinks
well
though
smoke
asidestereotypically
german
pours
from
12oz
bottle
into
tulip
glass
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
fingerthick
white
head
that
settles
into
a
thin
film
on
the
beer
aroma
of
smoked
pork
wood
campfire
welldone
bacon
and
burnt
sweet
toast
flavor
of
smoked
pork
burnt
toast
caramel
malts
toasted
sugar
peat
nectarine
honey
and
corn
syrup
the
flavor
drops
out
a
little
from
the
nose
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
smoky
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
a
quick
metallic
then
lingering
smoky
finish
sweet
and
smoky
i
cant
say
this
is
my
style
the
extreme
smokiness
balanced
with
the
light
malt
characteristics
make
this
a
very
interesting
beer
fans
of
this
would
do
themselves
a
favor
to
try
new
holland
chartooka
rye
for
an
american
take
on
a
smoked
doppelbock
equally
meritorious
d
ok
it
is
a
certainly
a
smoky
beer
with
nice
flavors
and
decent
feel
to
it
the
smokiness
doesnt
really
lend
itself
to
being
that
drinkable
but
for
a
smoked
beer
this
was
nice
mostly
clear
copperorange
little
bits
of
fine
sediment
suspended
in
the
liquid
small
creamy
yellowed
head
shrinks
to
a
fine
ring
clean
sweet
smoky
aroma
not
as
meaty
as
the
other
schlenkerla
beers
but
theres
still
a
certain
greasy
quality
to
it
caramel
malt
and
a
whiff
of
nobel
hops
sweet
pleasantly
smoked
caramel
malt
leather
and
floral
hops
quite
sweet
but
mild
smooth
almost
creamy
medium
bodied
not
for
everyone
perhaps
a
bit
sugary
but
expertly
crafted
as
usual
d
this
is
a
very
strange
beer
it
reminds
me
in
a
way
of
alba
scots
pine
ale
which
i
wouldnt
generally
consider
a
compliment
the
smoke
character
is
very
different
from
that
found
in
the
other
beech
smoked
schlenkerla
beers
this
is
much
more
spicy
and
intense
with
an
incense
like
quality
of
pine
and
licorice
that
does
strange
things
on
the
palate
when
it
hits
the
sweet
toffee
malt
the
individual
flavors
here
have
some
potential
but
when
it
all
comes
together
it
just
ends
up
as
a
sticky
weird
cloying
mess
a
rare
miss
from
the
masters
of
smoked
beer
this
was
a
good
beer
i
drank
it
with
out
pairing
it
with
food
i
would
recommend
drinking
it
while
enjoying
some
grilled
meat
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
is
light
and
i
like
the
flavor
there
is
no
hint
of
the
8
abv
this
beer
was
served
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
decent
ecru
foam
on
the
surface
that
was
inviting
the
nose
is
almost
totally
of
smoke
with
bit
of
caramel
in
the
background
the
flavor
has
a
bit
of
dryer
smoke
that
has
a
slightly
soured
finish
to
it
the
flavors
are
caramel
like
in
nature
beyond
the
smoke
but
its
mostly
smoke
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
acidic
side
drinkability
depended
for
me
it
was
hard
to
drink
just
by
itself
but
when
paired
with
grilled
foods
it
was
wonderful
so
i
leave
it
at
that
a
nice
beer
overall
edit
not
drinkable
which
i
always
took
to
mean
sessionable
but
the
best
smoked
beer
ive
ever
had
bumped
the
overal
from
2
5
to
4
tonyreavesjan
18
though
it
kind
of
draws
back
the
smokiness
a
little
still
pretty
smokey
no
ashiness
is
noted
will
be
looking

i
like
this
waaay
more
than
the
urbock
of
theirs
i
tried
awhile
back
the
smoke
is
still
the
dominant
player
here
im
pleasantly
blown
away
surprisingly
drinkable
for

and
smoke
taste
is
amazing
and
not
overpowering
complex
and
nowhere
near
as
onedimensional
as
many
rauchbiers
this
one
is

the
beer
goes
down
smoothly
and
is
rather
easy
to
drink
because
the
smokiness
is
not
overpowering
and
well

this

with

beers
of

just
an
amazing

the

there
but
not

it
sneaks

the

buttery

that

this
really
is
an

doppelbock
one
of
the
only
us
versions
id
say
are
worthy
of
pairing
up
against
the
german
stalwarts
of
the
genre
there
are
zero
unpleasant
flavors
the
entire
thing
comes
together
smoothly
easily
incorporating
a
high
abv
recipe
into
a
very
drinkable
package
not
the
best
ive
had
from
them
but
decent
over
rated
beer
however
love
this
brewery
and
most
of
the
stuff
coming
out
of
it
serving
type

good
beer
made
in
america
but
optimator
or
celebrator
still
reigns
supreme
in
this
style
of
beer
overall
ranks
up
there
with
the
best
of
breed
doppelbocks
for
me

i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
another
solid
beer
from
jacks
abby
they
continue
to
impress
me
o
plenty
to
like
here
this
is
more
densely
flavored
than
a
typical
doppel
to
tbe
point
that
i
think
it
comes
on
a
bit
too
strong
still
id
gladly
have
another
note
that
the
label
clearly
uses
the
americanized
saxonized
spelling
dopplebock
overall
very
tasty
beer
great
contributions
from
both
the
rich
malts
and
fruity
yeast
here
as
they
combine
to
create
an
enjoyable
doppelbock
the
9
feels
appropriate
but
i
like
the
edge
it
provides
with
the
toasted
grains
and
dark
fruit
notes
provides
what
i
look
for
in
a
solid
doppelbock
and
i
will
surely
have
this
again
o
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
to
compliment
a
roasted
potato
and
steak
supper
the
high
abv
certainly
sneaks
up
on
you
very
tasty
beer
it
is
different
for
the
style
without
the
big
sweet
bready
and
toasty
malts
but
instead
with
lots
of
fruit
flavors
the
alcohol
is
dangerously
well
hidden
and
it
is
still
delicious
overall
probably
the
most
spot
on
interpretation
of
the
style
that
ive
seen
in
an
american
brewed
doppelbock
only
missing
a
better
head
retention
but
overall
i
prefer
less
hop
character
and
an
overly
sweet
balance
i
think
ill
save
my
other
bottle
for
a
while
and
see
what
happens
simply
excellent
the
body
is
a
bit
thinner
than
some
of
the
german
dopplebocks
but
with
impeccable
balance
and
with
flavors
that
captivate
this
beer
is
contemporary
and
stylish
o
its
a
decent
beer
better
as
it
warms
but
there
are
some
offflavors
on
the
back
end
that
i
dont
care
for
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
i
think
its
presenting
itself
in
a
form
other
than
typical
heat
and
spice

tasting

my
first
offering
from
jacks
abby
fruits
very
interesting
take
on
a
dopplebock
bomber
pictured
here
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
tawny
goldencopper
color
with
two
or
three
fingers
of
creamy
tan
head
that
mellowed
out
rather
quickly
to
leave
some
frilly
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
decidedly
sweet
malty
aroma
that
evokes
brown
bread
toffee
honeyed
breakfast
cereal
dried
dark
fruits
raisin
prune
and
a
whiff
of
herbal
hops
decent
blast
of
alcohol
flavor
with
the
first
sip
although
the
rich
malt
flavors
from
the
nose
remain
dominant
along
with
an
emergent
syrupy
fruitiness
canned
peaches
and
stewed
pears
this
bread
and
fruit
spread
effect
carries
through
right
into
the
medicinal
boozy
finish
alcohol
is
not
concealed
body
on
the
thick
side
but
perhaps
lighter
than
expected
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
moderate
amount
of
gentle
carbonation
interesting
brew
a
blonde
doppelbock
less
immediately
dessertlike
than
other
examples
id
almost
describe
this
as
an
imperial
oktoberfest
in
terms
of
flavor
profile
more
toasted
malts
and
orchard
fruit
than
the
chocolate
cake
and
dark
fruits
one
gets
with
the
darker
doppelbocks
although
obviously
one
can
imperialize
a
lighter
and
drier
maibock
as
well
as
seemingly
done
here
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
it
had
most
of
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
but
the
sweetness
was
about
a
step
higher
then
it
needed
to
be
and
it
got
to
the
point
of
being
slightly
cloying
and
that
held
this
beer
back
a
little
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
wasnt
that
smooth
it
was
a
little
cloying
a
little
boozy
a
little
filling
but
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
half
a
bomber
is
the
right
amount
for
me
a
full
bomber
might
start
to
wear
on
me
towards
the
end
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
and
it
was
and
the
appearance
i
thought
they
were
both
pretty
good
aspects
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
high
sweetness
i
know
this
style
is
sweet
but
this
one
went
a
little
overboard
i
might
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
the
style
and
i
think
its
priced
nicely
but
its
not
the
type
of
beer
that
i
would
buy
on
a
regular
basis
i
would
recommend
this
to
fans
of
the
style
or
people
who
dont
mind
strong
and
sweet
beers
all
in
all
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
thought
it
was
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
if
the
sweetness
was
toned
down
a
little
and
the
alcohol
was
hidden
a
little
better
then
this
would
be
a
pretty
great
doppelbock
but
as
it
stands
now
it
its
nice
but
not
great
nice
work
guys
ill
have
to
keep
my
eye
out
for
more
beers
from
this
series
beer
is
mediumheavy
to
heavy
in
body
with
carbonation
of
low
intensity
resulting
in
a
smooth
slightly
foamy
though
mostly
sluggish
mouthfeel
ethanol
easily
felt
in
the
nostrils
and
on
throat
an
unfortunate
reminder
of
how
better
this
beer
could
have
been
with
a
lower
target
abv
closes
dry
with
plenty
of
stickiness
clinging
to
the
lips
and
palate
o
really
lost
me
on
the
taste
the
cough
medicine
doesnt
do
it
for
me
it
brings
the
beer
down
majorly
o
wonderful
beer
very
smooth
for
the
abv
worlds
of
flavor
in
this
beer
if
youre
wanting
a
good
malty
beer
this
is
it
great
very
dark
amber
looking
beer
which
poured
great
with
a
nice
rich
head
good
taste
but
fell
a
little
short
of
the
full
tasting
imperials
and
trippel
ipas
i
was
hoping
for
a
better
mouthfeel
overall
i
truly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
definitely
buy
some
again
when
avaiable
i
want
to
say
this
is
a
better
than
average
beer
with
a
nice
10
abv
i
did
have
this
beer
on
hand
for
several
months
so
i
am
wondering
if
i
did
it
a
disservice
by
not
trying
it
sooner
from
when
i
first
purchased
this
i
will
update
my
review
the
next
time
i
buy
this
beer
for
now
i
do
recommend
trying
it
it
is
a
fine
product
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
cloudy
tea
colored
with
a
nice
head
and
some
fair
lacing
hops
and
pit
fruit
hits
the
nose
sweetness
and
some
citrus
comes
through
taste
has
a
nice
hit
of
hops
on
the
tongue
followed
by
pit
fruit
in
the
peach
area
some
honey
sweetness
rolling
around
there
as
well
mouthfeel
was
spicy
sweetwarm
and
prickly
with
hops
and
pit
fruit
fighting
back
and
forth
this
was
on
my
want
list
for
a
while
and
im
so
glad
i
found
it
a
really
great
beer
in
all
the
right
places
and
i
feel
shmaltz
took
the
double
bock
and
rocked
it
as
a
imperial
american
bock
i
would
grab
a
bomber
of
this
again
anytime
to
have
on
hand
very
tasty
and
at
10
abv
it
has
a
nice
balance
and
is
very
drinkable
o
this
beer
is
like
a
primal
scream
alot
of
complexity
through
malt
and
hop
structure
its
definitely
not
my
thing
but
i
respect
it
for
what
it
is
schmaltz
definitely
new
what
they
were
doing
when
they
brewed
this
those
jews
mean
business
huh
i
feel
like
ive
said
that
before
cheers
overall
decent
version
of
the
style
a
bit
harsh
with
the
chemical
and
the
bitter
a
bomber
of
this
is
proving
to
be
a
bit
much
and
as
much
as
it
is
fairly
palatable
i
wont
finish
it

is

and

that
is

alcohol
is
decently
well
hidden
with
only
a
moderate
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
solid
imperial
doppelbock
some
nice
flavor
robustness
and
balance
and
fairly
smooth
to
sip
on
a
bit
estery
at
times
but
still
quite
enjoyable
though
definitely
a
slow
sipper
this
improved
a
lot
as
it
warmed
up
to
room
temperature
overall
i
like
my
laty
brews
but
whe
it
gets
this
malty
it
leans
in
the
other
direction
still
a
decent
one
and
like
i
said
it
reminds
me
of
a
samiclause
i
like
the
10
abv
but
ya
definitely
taste
all
of
it
o
very
intense
this
is
not
an
ordinary
beer
at
all
but
i
guess
this
is
what
shmaltz
is
going
for
this
takes
a
huge
toll
on
the
nose
and
palate
so
be
prepared
for
an
aggressive
dopplebock
for
the
price
though
well
done
and
a
nice
kick
with
abv
if
you
are
into
that
dark
orangered
color
with
light
caramel
creamy
head
smell
is
sweetmolasses
with
a
bit
of
biscuit
taste
of
light
syrup
carbonation
with
the
alcohol
gives
it
almost
spicy
finish
the
body
leaves
a
sweet
coating
on
the
tongue
alcohol
content
is
apparent
but
goes
well
with
bock
flavor
ive
had
this
too
many
times
but
never
bothered
pouring
it
way
better
experience
poured
worth
a
try
the
bomber
is
usually
about
5
the
taste
is
much
better
than
the
smell
but
far
from
amazing
its
bitter
it
seems
that
hops
is
probably
where
that
astringent
metallic
smell
came
from
too
much
hops
thats
really
my
only
problem
with
this
beer
its
a
problem
i
have
with
a
lot
of
american
crafts
they
want
to
pour
lots
and
lots
of
hops
and
types
of
beers
that
shouldnt
have
them
this
is
one
of
them
keep
your
large
hop
quantities
out
of
my
doppelbock
its
supposed
to
be
a
sweet
beer
i
like
my
sweet
beers
thats
why
i
buy
them
theres
is
no
need
to
make
this
into
a
bitter
beer
the
hops
are
masking
what
otherwise
could
be
interesting
complexity
i
think
im
detecting
some
earthy
malty
sweetness
under
there
somewhere
but
its
hard
to
detect
through
the
hops
so
im
missing
out
on
half
the
fun
of
this
beer
some
people
mentioned
that
this
beer
was
boozy
and
its
got
some
booziness
but
i
was
honestly
hoping
for
more
at
10
thats
getting
masked
by
the
bitterness
too
and
i
am
disappointed
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on

of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace

the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus

and
alcohol
taste
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
citrus
zest
and
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
all
that
special
in
my
opinion
cheers
lampertland
overall
i
like
where
this
beer
was
going
but
the
high
alcohol
made
it
tough
to
drink
the
beer
was
tough
to
finish
given
how
full
bodied
it
was
and
the
up
front
alcohol
decent
beer
but
i
dont
need
my
doppelbock
to
be
imperial
in
any
way
score
takes
a
hit
for
the
full
body
leading
to
a
filling
beer
that
is
way
to
robust
for
the
style
o
its
a
decent
beer
but
not
the
best
ive
had
a
little
on
the
boozy
side
but
if
you
like
doppelbocks
id
give
it
a
try
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
great
doppelbock
flavors
nice
fruits
esters
malts
wheat
and
the
banana
flavors
really
add
an
interesting
touch
the
booze
starts
very
low
and
drinkable
but
heats
up
as
it
goes
to
almost
too
much
but
then
finishes
so
never
steps
over
the
line
and
the
hops
are
fairly
nice
and
balance
a
nice
beer
to
have
now
and
then
but
not
too
much
finishing
this
22oz
by
myself
will
probably
be
tough
i
think
i
like
the
barrel
aged
version
better
as
i
love
bourbon
and
that
really
stood
out
but
this
can
stand
on
its
own
pretty
well
overall
love
the
barreled
version
but
this
is
not
right
its
like
spiked
grape
juice
will
not
revisit
found
a
couple
22
oz
bottles
at
boulevard
liquor
in
san
diego
served
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
nice
sized
off
white
head
that
soon
settled
down
to
a
light
cover
and
loads
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
orange
mahoganey
aroma
is
malty
bourbon
yeast
malt
earth
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
with
addition
of
a
bit
of
carbonic
tang
and
yeast
body
is
spot
on
carbonation
good
finish
at
first
was
sans
alcohol
but
towards
the
bottom
of
the
mug
as
it
warmed
up
the
booziness
came
out
great
beer
bravo
maestro
o
well
i
had
tried
a
sip
of
this
once
a
few
years
ago
and
thought
it
was
pretty
good
on
a
summer
day
of
just
relaxing
with
friends
its
different
than
i
remember
but
still
tasty
i
wouldnt
exactly
say
that
i
am
fully
behind
this
beer
with
a
pick
some
of
this
stuff
up
mentality
as
i
think
it
has
to
be
tried
with
quite
an
open
mind
cause
it
is
sure
a
beastly
brew
but
overall
i
like
it
cant
say
i
love
it
but
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
again
sometime
prost
blockhead
is
more
barleywine
than
doppelbock
in
my
book
im
glad
i
had
it
but
it
doesnt
really
fit
its
style
i
am
a
sucker
for
bourbon
aged
beers
so
this
had
an
advantage
right
off
the
bat
the
color
and
initial
sniff
are
very
good
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
great
the
finish
puts
this
one
in
another
category
just
a
great
beer
on
a
fall
afternoon
paired
with
a
spicy
chilli
overall
i
have
been
impressed
with
most
of
hebrews
offerings
and
this
is
yet
another
great
beer
best
part
is
the
bottle
was
around
7
bucks
so
i
would
highly
consider
getting
it
again
very
nice
imperial
dopplebock
o
not
quite
the
beer
i
remember
from
gabf
but
still
good
recommended
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
coney
island
beers
a
nice
take
on
the
style
pours
a
murky
red
copper
hue
which
leaves
a
very
creamy
two
finger
head
with
a
few
dimples
and
stays
with
also
sporadic
lacingthe
smell
is
sweet
caramel
and
toffeehoneyboiled
candy
and
marzipanthe
mouthfeel
is
just
under
medium
bodied
and
a
touch
resiny
with
tastes
of
sweet
toffeemarzipanresin
coated
piney
hopscandied
oranges
and
finished
with
a
nice
twist
of
grapefruit
and
caramel
and
overall
for
me
this
was
abit
of
a
suprise
packet
as
its
not
totally
true
to
style
but
thats
how
coney
island
rocks
and
yeah
i
would
buy
again
cheers
o
this
one
is
a
bit
difficult
to
drink
it
comes
in
a
big
bottle
so
come
prepared
with
someone
to
share
it
with
sipping
lager
that
feels
like
driving
a
nail
into
your
head
always
fun
this
is
a
above
average
imperial
almerican
bock
ale
poured
with
a
medium
amount
of
tan
foam
the
smell
or
roasted
malts
and
mild
hops
with
a
hint
of
sweet
candy
and
alcohol
was
evident
in
the
aroma
the
taste
of
sweet
roasted
malts
mild
hops
and
a
hint
of
alcoholic
sweet
candy
put
a
nice
buzz
if
you
are
on
an
empty
stomach
still
a
nice
balance
of
compontents
o
not
my
style
of
beer
first
doppelbock
i
try
has
a
lot
of
body
big
flavors
with
a
crispy
feel
this
brew
pours
a
nice
deep
redamber
color
crested
with
a
nice
head
that
retains
very
well
the
aroma
is
a
bit
muted
but
primarily
consists
of
nutty
roasted
malts
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
good
its
quite
a
strong
beer
with
strong
sugary
nutty
malts
and
a
decent
amount
of
hops
and
dark
fruits
this
is
quite
the
huge
lager
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
a
thick
brew
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
also
very
good
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
lager
id
recommend
picking
a
bottle
up
poured
a
3
slightly
yellowed
yead
body
is
a
clear
dark
reddish
amber
smells
of
medium
malt
and
light
hops
taste
is
far
bolder
than
i
expected
almost
more
of
a
belgian
tripel
than
a
lager
in
fact
the
only
lager
aspect
to
this
beer
is
the
crisp
finish
otherwise
look
smell
and
most
of
the
taste
seem
like
some
other
beer
entirely
still
its
a
good
beer
and
i
always
like
the
funky
coney
island
poster
style
labeling
from
schmaltz
o
unique
and
big
in
flavour
very
impressed
ill
likely
try
a
bottle
to
see
if
its
any
different
light
amber
brown
body
small
trails
of
tiny
carbonation
rising
from
off
center
of
class
when
examined
closely
one
finger
white
head
medium
dissipation
with
acceptable
lacing
big
hoppy
presence
in
the
nose
a
lot
of
floral
note
along
with
northwest
hops
grapefruit
and
a
bit
funky
ryeish
aromas
to
boot
taste
is
really
hoppy
for
the
style
perhaps
to
much
so
despite
big
malt
bill
this
is
a
hop
monster
the
hallertaus
dominated
mouthfeel
is
medium
pretty
dry
finish
due
to
use
of
oats
and
way
way
boozy
to
drink
more
than
one
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
though
far
outside
parameters
of
traditional
dopplebocks
good
value
for
abv
but
this
was
just
too
boozy
to
be
enjoyable
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
my
glass
o
this
beer
does
have
some
drawbacks
e
g
the
alcohol
presence
but
is
an
alright
brew
overall
o
overall
a
good
interesting
beer
not
sure
on
the
style
because
the
bottle
says
lager
and
ba
says
dopplebock
nice
hints
of
malts
alcohol
and
some
smoky
sweetness
the
booziness
really
held
this
down
for
me
on
tap
at
wine
world
medium
brown
with
a
finger
of
head
and
good
lacing
too
cold
to
have
much
on
the
nose
good
dark
fruit
and
malty
flavor
with
a
crisp
finish
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
this
will
be
a
goto
when
im
at
wine
world
i
liked
it
i
drank
two
d
this
had
a
fantastic
smell
and
nice
taste
and
ok
body
but
it
wasnt
very
clean
with
a
harsh
aftertaste
and
lots
of
alcohol
so
it
wasnt
very
easy
to
drink
age
may
help
mellow
this
out
maybe
a
lot
of
age
fresh
it
really
wasnt
bad
but
it
was
quite
rough
around
the
edges
ive
passed
by
this
beer
in
stores
since
the
first
time
i
saw
it
why
i
just
dont
go
for
lagers
anymore
so
i
didnt
really
even
give
it
a
2nd
look
yesterday
i
found
myself
at
the
schmaltz
micromicro
brewery
on
coney
island
and
received
a
sample
of
this
lager
now
theres
no
way
its
a
lager
but
it
is
considered
a
double
bockstrong
lager
clocking
in
at
10
apv
its
a
sipper
but
i
find
it
hard
to
sip
this
bomber
will
disappear
in
30
40
minutes
its
taste
to
me
is
somewhere
between
a
double
bockbarleywinestrong
ale
no
matter
its
pure
deliciousness
comes
through
the
alcohol
is
there
but
mostly
hidden
it
reminds
me
of
the
jewbelation
14
but
at
only
10
its
not
going
to
knock
me
out
as
fast
its
sugary
raisiny
malty
and
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
at
the
end
it
won
the
silver
at
the
2010
world
beer
championships
and
deservedly
so
this
is
my
first
bottle
and
it
wont
be
my
last
especially
for
the
price
at
10abv
you
cant
expect
a
light
refreshing
beverage
but
this
one
seems
to
strive
to
achieve
the
feeling
of
the
human
blockhead
on
the
label
with
a
nail
in
his
face
because
this
lager
has
a
strong
feel
of
alcohol
fumes
and
an
unpleasant
bitter
aftertaste
that
overwhelms
any
good
qualities
i
might
have
otherwise
noted
about
this
beer
the
good
frontend
flavors
disappear
before
you
have
a
chance
to
savor
them
the
finish
is
clean
and
very
mellow
the
booze
is
somewhat
strong
but
i
am
really
enjoying
this
with
the
label
i
guess
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
different
but
this
did
not
disappoint
an
interesting
warmer
of
a
beer
i
would
buy
it
again
and
look
forward
to
trying
the
other
beers
in
this
lneup
spectacular
in
a
word
o
this
beer
seems
to
resemble
a
hybrid
between
a
doppelbock
and
a
barleywine
this
characteristic
and
the
high
alcohol
content
make
it
beer
to
sip
next
to
the
fireplace
on
a
cold
winter
night
o
a
very
tasty
doppelbock
full
flavoured
and
unique
goes
down
smooth
and
smashes
you
in
the
face
i
would
definitely
order
this
on
tap
again
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
schmaltz
brews
ive
had
to
date
but
that
really
isnt
saying
much
d
the
drinkability
here
is
good
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
damn
tasty
i
really
am
enjoying
this
beer
it
is
my
first
beer
on
the
coney
island
side
of
shmaltz
brewing
and
im
pretty
impressed
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
booze
presence
here
that
makes
it
a
bit
more
of
a
sipper
but
i
think
the
strong
booze
presence
is
actually
kind
of
nice
i
recommend
trying
this
id
definitely
pick
up
another
bottle
of
this
yes
i
notice
my
review
is
way
lower
than
the
average
but
i
calls
em
like
i
sees
em
and
this
is
crap
d
is
what
it
gets
d
the
biggest
issue
with
this
is
the
alcohol
content
it
is
quite
potent
and
noticeably
so
thin
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
slightly
watery
low
carbonation
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
big
fizzy
tan
head
head
recedes
quickly
but
leaves
some
nice
lacing
scent
is
malty
with
some
fruit
notes
and
faint
earthy
hops
taste
is
a
definite
malt
bomb
candied
malts
faint
hop
flavors
and
somewhat
cloying
caramel
notes
definitely
lots
of
alcohol
which
i
guess
isnt
too
surprising
as
this
clocks
in
at
10
medium
bodied
with
an
appropriate
level
of
carbonation
gotta
be
honest
this
is
the
first
beer
i
have
ever
considered
drain
pouring
cant
really
call
it
a
mess
guess
its
just
not
my
thing
decent
drinkability
i
think
the
alcohol
makes
drinking
mant
a
challenge
overall
though
it
is
good
the
taste
is
initially
toasted
malts
with
a
fairly
large
amount
of
lingering
caramel
sweetness
there
is
something
off
here
however
many
conflicting
tastes
i
cannot
pick
out
it
not
alcohol
but
this
beer
is
just
a
mess
im
not
sure
aging
will
help
because
its
not
alcohol
i
detect
just
a
poorly
balanced
beer
drain
pour
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
strong
kick
decent
representation
of
style
there
are
a
lot
of
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
before
this
one
pours
a
fairly
dark
amber
color
with
a
a
bit
of
an
off
white
head
good
staying
power
and
some
mild
legs
the
nose
brings
forward
quite
a
bit
of
divergent
malt
with
some
nice
amber
and
caramel
as
well
as
some
light
dark
fruits
hints
of
floral
hops
the
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
and
malty
without
too
much
depth
to
it
good
feel
with
nice
carbonation
and
not
too
much
heat
drinks
fairly
well
but
is
a
bit
plain
in
the
flavor
department
sure
the
alcohol
bullies
the
taste
buds
aroundhard
not
to
considering
its
size
big
on
flavor
though
not
on
an
even
keel
a
little
bit
of
extreme
americana
is
on
our
breath
after
every
sip
look
at
this
beer
as
a
nightcap
served
from
bottle
into
a
coast
imperial
pint
pours
redbrown
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
malt
fruit
and
subtle
hop
the
flavor
was
of
malt
subtle
hop
and
a
nutty
note
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
too
bad
but
it
also
wasnt
that
good
either
i
only
picked
this
one
up
because
it
was
on
a
sale
table
where
i
bought
it
and
i
had
never
had
it
before
just
needed
a
little
more
of
everything
and
to
tone
back
on
the
malt
flavor
i
was
getting
right
up
front
as
it
was
a
bit
overwhelming
looked
nice
however
drinkability
ultimately
this
beer
comes
off
as
rather
unbalanced
and
just
doesnt
work
that
well
for
me
too
bad
as
i
could
smell
it
all
evening
notes
this
is
a
very
big
concentrated
beer
with
a
heavy
hit
of
alcohol
at
10
by
volume
it
is
a
bit
raw
and
this
cuts
into
its
drinkability
d
this
clean
lager
has
a
nice
fullbodied
malt
profile
with
some
nice
sweetness
supported
by
the
dry
hop
finish
to
easy
to
drink
at
10
abv
great
bang

drinkability
sure
its
a
good
beer
but
im
not
sure
how
interesting
i
want
my
amber
to
be
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
or
two
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
very
strong
hops
and
very
filling
drinkability
is
not
bad
pretty
flavorful
but
a
touch
hot
making
it
a
enjoyably
tasty
slow
sipper
one
of
which
is
plenty
not
for
your
average
beer
blockhead
enjoy
this
one
slow
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
a
bear
of
a
beer
too
sweet
and
thick
with
a
powerful
alcohol
punch
this
is
more
grizzly
bear
that
kitten
hard
to
believe
its
almost
10abv
but
it
will
lay
you
out
if
youre
no
careful
so
yah
i
guess
its
drinkable
man
oh
man
this
lager
redefines
lager
heresy
to
some
sure
and
probably
even
sickening
to
some
others
i
couldnt
drink
this
often
but
im
definitely
glad
to
have
made
its
acquaintance
hail
shmaltz
glad
i
tried
it
but
probably
not
again
this
is
an
interesting
beerthe
style
could
be
in
a
few
different
categories
poured

note
whoo
the

really
hits
ya
from

and
boozy
is
the
best
way
to
describe
it
with
a
slight

edgeits
flavors
are
decent
and
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
this
beer
is
dangerousthe
sweetness
is
anticingbut
man
as
it
warms
it
gets
to
be
a
headache
inducera
good
name
for
this
beer
i
guess
that
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
big
amber
ale
brewed
with
lager
yeast
but
this
kind
of
settled
into
more
of
a
doppelbock
feel
to
me
and
a
pretty
decent
one
at
that
lots
of
thick
sticky
and
chewy
flavors
here
with
a
smooth
drinkibility
for
the
size
i
could
see
the
heaviness
of
malts
maybe
being
a
little
too
much
for
easy
consumption
of
a
22
oz
bottle
by
yourself
but
i
split
this
one
with
a
buddy
and
didnt
have
any
problems
really
really
enjoyed
this
beer
there
arent
too
many
lagers
out
there
that
i
would
consider
among
my
favorites
but
this
is
one
of
them
overall
not
bad
but
nothing
too
special
a
decent
brew
to
sit
back
and
watch
some
basketball
with
in
general
this
is
a
good
beer
and
part
of
a
great
series
of
lagers
10
eh
that
spells
trouble
as
it
goes
down
far
too
easily
im
starting
to
get
more
and
more
sold
on
this
brewery
after
some
shakier
first
impressions
another
very
nice
brew
from
hebrew
and
with
the
5
50
for
a
bomber
of
10
an
absolute
great
buy
still
a
little
confused
with
this
one
before
drinking
it
i
thought
it
was
a
dopplebock
this
site
has
it
as
an
american
amberred
lager
and
i
think
it
drinks
and
tastes
like
a
dipa
oh
well
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
guess
thats
all
that
matters
full
and
creamy
mouthfeel
slightly
tannic
alcohol
warmth
rises
up
the
cheeks
and
vapors
come
out
the
nose
average
drnkability
due
to
the
finish
that
detracts
from
the
experience
d
this
is
a
drain
pour
for
me
unfortunately
the
malt
structure
would
work
with
an
ale
because
the
right
yeasts
could
call
forth
subtle
accents
like
fruit
and
floral
notes
the
lager
yeasts
seem
to
be
too
sparse
for
a
beer
this
big
a
big
disappointment
had
this
in
summer
but
still
enjoyed
it
overalla
nice
unique
beer
with
a
good
taste
the
merging
of
styles
isnt
perfect
but
i
can
appreciate
a
good
risk
d
one
and
done
one
and
done
for
me
but
i
do
enjoy
other
coney
products
quite
a
bit
d
like
hops
dthis
is
an
interesting
beer
and
maybe
i
will
try
it
again
or
get
another
one
to
age
and
see
if
it
mellows
a
bit
it
just
seems
a
bit
to
hot
at
present
but
i
have
to
give
these
guys
credit
for
pushing
the
style
limits
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
well
i
didnt
think
to
highly
of
this
one
i
just
couldnt
get
over
how
pronounced
the
alcohol
was
it
overpowered
what
little
flavor
the
beer
had
and
masked
the
decent
aromas
and
the
drinkability
forget
about
it
i
can
say
that
i
really
could
only
somewhat
enjoy
1
small
goblet
of
it
i
have
had
lots
of
strong
brews
in
the
past
that
actually
mask
the
alcohol
extremely
well
but
not
this
one
i
dont
recommend
it
good
brewery
and
a
one
time
try
kinda
beer
not
a
fan
drinks
pretty
easy
despite
the
heft
abv
but
after
2
bombers
i
think
even
a
malthead
like
me
would
say
uncle
one
of
the
better
offerings
in
the
coney
island
line
imo
very
tasty
beer
that
is
a
dopplebock
yet
with
all
the
hops
tastes
like
an
imperial
red
ale
this
beer
is
lots
of
malt
hops
and
that
borderline
sweetness
that
makes
a
dunkel
i
like
the
thick
mouthfeel
and
the
smooth
finish
with
hide
the
highish
abv
in
fact
the
malt
really
shows
up
more
as
the
beer
warms
up
and
the
caramel
flavours
come
into
play
nice
beer
in
a
style
that
can
be
overly
sweet
sometimes
but
not
this
time
purchased

az

brown

burnt

roasted

hops
in

dry
tangy
and
a
little
bitter

caramel
and
roasted

some

faint
and
some
earthy
tones
not
much
of
a
smell
though
taste
is
a

stronger
but
not
much
better
bitter
and
spicy
with
random
hits
of
sweetness
of

and

began
to
develop
better
flavorfeel
when
it
started
to
warm
up
better
beer
on
the
45º
side
of
it
d
i
mustve
misread
the
label
as
this
was
completely
different
from
what
i
expected
again
like
a
barleywine
with
strong
alcohol
that
work
against
its
drinkability
coney
island
human
blockhead
is
a
very
clear
copper
lager
with
a
dense
yellowish
offwhite
head
that
leaves
great
lacing
it
has
a
tart
aroma
with
sweet
malt
notes
its
full
bodied
and
very
smooth
with
a
clean
dry
finish
it
tastes
tart
and
sweet
and
syrupy
and
simple
its
rather
lightly
bittered
with
a
grassy
herbal
spice
it
tastes
clean
its
very
drinkable
but
strong
it
can
pour
with
a
large
head
i
like
the
rich
dark
amber
color
this
is
a
beer
to
share
with
friends
i
love
the
price
for
the
220z
bottle
around
6
bucks
i
look
forward
to
trying
other
brews
from
schmaltz
even
a
little
warmer
than
serving
temperature
you
get
some
wild
wine
and
fruit
flavors
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
spring
beers
it
poured
a
thick
dark
and
deep
copper
i
got
very
little
head
to
it
smell
was
molases
with
a
hint
of
spice
and
apple
very
inviting
to
drink
taste
is
very
close
to
what
smell
was
spicy
malty
sweet
like
brown
sugar
next
to
no
lacing
every
drink
was
smooth
and
masked
the
alcohol
quite
well
aftertaste
is
a
sweet
malty
resiny
taste
that
lingers
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
buy
more
to
put
away
and
consume
on
a
special
day
the
beer
is
too
big
for
a
22oz
bomber
are
lagers
supposed
to
come
in
bombers
if
so
should
they
be
thick
and
heavy
if
your
answer
is
yes
then
this
is
the
beer
for
you
as
i
continue
to
scrutinize
the
label
i
make
note
that
it
is
a
tough
as
nails
lager
i
guess
that
means
it
aint
exactly
trying
to
be
sessionable
make
what
you
will
but
ill
set
aside
my
second
serving
for
later
this
big
beer
packs
an
unexpected
punch
no
trace
of
alcoholpretty
drinkable
drinkability
it
went
down
nice
but
1
bomber
is
more
then
i
would
want
i
needed
a
beer
buddy
for
this
one
d
like
a
sideshow
performer
this
is
interesting
for
a
few
minutes
but
gets
tired
quickly
seems
like
a
beer
that
was
crafted
to
push
boundaries
10
red
lager
and
it
does
just
loses
drinkability
quickly
as
the
boozy
warmth
catches
up
and
the
sweetness
grows
overbearing
likable
and
worth
a
try
probably
should
have
recapped
this
after
the
first
pour
and
saved
the
rest
for
later
or
split
it
a
big
boy
beer
all
right
and
obviously
pushing
the
limits
of
the
style
bocks
can
be
imperial
sure
but
im
getting
hints
and
effects
that
transcend
doppelbocks
and
come
closer
to
english
barleywines
funny
what
agreeably
drinkable
booze
bombs
will
do
to
a
guy
anyway
i
dont
think
this
despite
its
full
flavours
should
be
consumed
in
quantity
in
case
you
start
thinking
of
emulating
the
titular
profession
this
beer
is
too
hot
to
be
very
drinkable
not
bad
just
not
enough
balance
pours
a
mix
of
copper
and
rust
hues
very
quick
foam
and
only
a
single
file
column
of
bubbles
sweet
fruits
like
cherries
and
pears
help
define
this
carmelized
malt
scented
brew
the
faint
hops
give
off
just
a
touch
of
wood
lots
of
fuzzy
feeling
caramel
malts
are
at
the
forefront
of
taste
the
fruits
and
alcohol
dont
develop
till
late
middle
all
through
the
finish
of
this
beer
syrupy
and
warm
malty
sweet
palate
but
there
is
a
little
more
bubble
on
the
tongue
than
could
be
said
for
an
ale
a
good
sipper
that
has
a
progressively
warming
alcoholic
palate
as
the
beer
its
self
warms
human
blockhead
is
good
beer
if
you
like
big
beer
big
bocks
and
bitterness
unfortunately
that
probably
doesnt
apply
to
very
many
craft
beer
lovers
regarding
the
coney
island
freaks
series
albino
python
is
the
best
and
freaktoberfest
is
the
worst
this
one
sword
swallower
and
coney
island
lager
are
somewhere
in
between
ontap
at
the
pit
in
raleigh
served
in
a
maredsous
tulip
a
crisp
copper
with
a
thin
khaki
head
that
leaves
slight
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
booze
the
taste
is
a
nice
amount
of
lingering
sweet
malts
and
a
decent
hop
presence
the
beer
is
quite
heavy
with
sticky
alcohol
the
is
an
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
if
this
beer
were
a
pound
puppy
it
would
be
put
to
sleep
the
taste
is
strong
alcohol
but
rich
and
fairly
flavourful
with
a
raisinyprune
spice
rum
caramelised
fruit
candy
and
cherry
medecine
its
mostly
sweet
and
spicey
negative
points
are
that
its
a
little
too
rough
strong
and
hot
the
elements
are
a
bit
off
balance
and
it
is
somewhat
onedimensional
thin
in
character
and
not
very
wellrounded
however
the
flavour
it
has
is
lasting
and
pleasant
with
some
character
and
it
is
only
slightly
too
rough
mostly
staying
smooth
enough
to
be
enjoyable
to
drink
without
getting
tiresome
a
fix
for
those
seeking
a
sucker
punch
of
earthy
sweetness
as
much
of
an
oxymoron
as
that
sounds
tastes
a
great
deal
like
a
very
young
barleywine
more
than
a
doppelbock
although
as
the
latter
its
a
very
hepped
up
version
turned
up
to
11
yet
not
quite
fine
tuned
enough
to
endure
comfortable
prolonged
lengthy
exposure
ride
the
roller
coaster
but
take
a
good
breather
between
turns
the
taste
is
deep
roasted
caramel
malts
maybe
a
touch
of
molasses
brown
sugars
maybe
some
vanilla
in
there
as
well
this
beer
is
quite
appropriately
matched
to
the
style
with
a
big
palate
this
isnt
an
overly
complex
beer
either
it
is
quite
sweet
but
it
does
have
a
prickly
mouthfeel
and
it
isnt
all
that
smooth
there
is
a
slightly
alcohol
soaked
raisin
or
plum
presence
towards
the
finish
that
is
significant
to
the
beer
if
you
want
a
strong
double
bock
that
is
drinkable
warming
substantial
and
full
bodied
very
sweet
and
not
overly
boozy
than
this
is
a
pretty
good
option
drinkability
quite
a
different
beer
liked
it
a
bit
better
colder
than
warm
started
out
tremendous
and
faded
a
bit
during
consumption
still
a
winner
in
my
book
copper
colored
body
was
a
bit
hazy
due
to
the
yeast
and
displayed
a
nice
bit
of
steady
and
fine
carbonation
unfortunately
all
those
bubbles
only
amounted
to
a
small
head
the
smell
was
sweet
and
caramelized
and
rather
mild
the
taste
was
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
as
my
tongue
was
coated
with
flavors
of
dates
honey
and
brown
sugar
there
was
a
dose
of
metallic
bitterness
that
followed
and
the
finish
was
like
the
start
sweet
but
fading
quite
sticky
and
filling
in
the
mouth
not
much
burn
considering
the
strength
reminded
me
of
some
of
the
other
sweet
beers
from
schmaltz
a
bit
of
chore
to
down
the
whole
bomber
for
me
nice
full
mouthfeel
not
overly
heavy
for
a
doppel
low
carbonation
adds
to
the
smoothness
if
not
for
the
hops
this
would
be
a
much
more
drinkable
beer
d
some
like
em
hot
blipped
more
human
than
human
by
white
zombie
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
redbrown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
warm
burnt
toffee
scent
thats
loaded
up
with
caramel
malts
its
rich
with
a
subtle
warmth
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
very
bitter
taste
that
doesnt
mix
well
with
the
burnt
toffee
flavor
its
a
bit
harsh
with
a
warm
dryness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
smelling
brew
but
the
taste
is
a
bit
unbalanced
very
big
tan
head
sits
on
top
of
a
clear
reddish
brown
body
carbonation
is
kinda
low
but
the
lacing
was
decent
the
smell
is
a
5050
combination
of
caramel
and
alcohol
i
dont
know
if
this
really
qualifies
as
a
doppelbock
but
its
pretty
good
whatever
it
is
modestly
but
appropriately
hopped
surprisingly
drinkable
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
in
it
leaves
the
tongue
feeling
a
little
slick
afterwards
whoever
called
this
a
lagerbarleywine
was
right
on
the
money
its
kind
of
reminding
me
of
a
slightly
aged
stone
old
guardian
22oz
bomber
served
in
a
duvel
tulip
poured
a
coppergold
with
a
thin
tan
head
malty
aroma
with
a
little
molasses
and
some
noble
hops
full
bodied
and
rich
more
malt
in
the
flavor
caramel
sweetness
there
are
some
hops
in
the
finish
to
balance
a
bit
of
alcohol
i
think
the
lager
yeast
almost
makes
it
too
clean
i
dont
what
you
would
call
this
a
lager
barley
wine
i
like
that
shmaltz
tries
a
lot
of
different
things
but
this
didnt
do
much
for
me
d
this
really
reminded
me
of
some
of
the
strong
ales
from
hebrew
really
sweet
and
malty
with
a
big
alcohol
presence
notes
all
i
knew
when
i
ordered
this
was
that
it
was
listed
as
a
lager
had
no
idea
this
was
a
doppelbock
and
i
dont
think
i
wouldve
guessed
as
much
too
fruity
sweet
and
too
hot
bottle
from
the
davis
coop
pours
a
deep
deep
blood
red
with
perfect
clarity
and
a
short
white
head
that
falls
off
after
a
while
laces
in
a
watery
fashion
smells
of
grenadine
malt
and
alcohol
but
in
a
good
way
very

worth

could
be

as
is
this

overall
the

definitely
distracts
at

nothing

nothing

either
proceed
with
caution

for

of
a
reformulation

the
aroma
is
a
touch
like
hemp
caramel
malt
citrus
pine
and
tropical
fruit
the
appearance
is
rich
amber
with
a
large
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
smooth
overall
a
nice
beer
it
is
both
interesting
as
well
as
comforting
i
want
another
drinkability
cihb
is
brash
and
straightforward
with
its
delivery
of
sweetness
its
plump
mouthfeel
and
overall
alcohol
especially
when
compared
to
its
traditional
german
counterparts
though
i
still
found
it
to
be
enjoyable
d
nicely
priced
and
a
decent
beer
but
the
taste
needs
a
bit
more
malt
and
a
lot
less
alcohol
imo
the
drink
is
fullbodied
rich
and
silkysmooth
with
a
palate
coolingtorso
warming
effect
that
is
undeniable
and
potent
once
the
booziness
fades
into
its
own
dulledsenses
milieu
the
brew
is
dangerously
drinkable
especially
given
the
asswhipping
itll
put
on
you
if
you
dont
watch
out
always
impressed
with
the
way
schmaltz
brewery
can
continue
to
brew
interesting
lagers
for
the
coney
island
line
looks
great
reddish
brown
nut
brown
like
nice
nose
sweet
and
heady
something
struck
me
as
off
on
the
pallet
quick
finish
overall
i
enjoyed
this
bock
enjoyed
ontap
served
perfectly
at
brother
tuckers
pompano
beach
beautiful
white
lace
on
chocolate
colour
chocolate
malt
rich
taste
like
a
good
old
ale
style
tasty
stuff
well
malted
and
not
too
sweet
but
somewhat
sweet
way
above
average
mouthfeel
satisfying
finish
its
drinkability
is
probably
hindered
by
its
strength
and
size
but
on
the
other
hand
i
guess
thats
what
the
human
blockhead
is
all
about
its
unique
im
not
sure
ive
ever
had
a
beer
quite
like
this
and
it
evolves
as
you
work
through
it
with
it
warming
and
your
taste
buds
getting
used
to
certain
things
and
then
finding
others
so
there
is
complexity
hmmmm
better
try
another
a
very
nice
bock
offering
imho
that
is
easy
to
consume
there
is
no
indication
of
the
8
8
abv
so
that
makes
this
one
a
little
dangerous
but
yummy
this
was
very
good
and
i
highly
recommend
overall
this
was
an
interesting
beer
that
piqued
my
interest
in
the
coney
island
series
again
after
a
not
so
great
visit
by
their
lager
worth
a
shot
easy
to
drink
for
sure
and
not
a
bad
bock
from
shmaltz
brewing
but
nothing
really
special
drinkability
a
bock
a
double
lager
a
mishmash
of
nonbalanced
booziness
though
theres
enough
to
make
it
tolerable
and
interesting
upon
my
first
and
probably
only
try
of
this
brew
would
i
try
it
again
no
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
id
stick
to
the
hebrew
beers
though
as
they
never
disappointment
im
still
waiting
for
a
coney
island
brew
to
really
impress
me
as
this
one
definitely
did
not
stick
to
hebrew
overall
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
bock
despite
the
hefty
abv
pours
a
clear
but
dark
amber
with
a
creme
head
nose
is
sticky
sweet
like
sweetened
something
flavor
is
tangy
like
a
sugary
malty
thing
a
bit
too
much
really
feel
is
sticky
slick
on
the
liquid
and
the
carbonation
is
okay
a
bit
too
sticky
overall
this
just
lacks
the
balance
to
pull
it
all
off
its
okay
sure
but
i
could
deal
with
about
8
ounces
less
still
i
cant
figure
out
what
it
is
id
swear
its
a
brown
ale
or
an
octoberfest
yes
thats
the
closest
thing
i
dont
think
it
fits
with
summer
definitely
a
fall
beer
for
my
taste
at
least
oh
and
the
tap
handle
was
cool
shaped
like
a
bottle
with
a
cartoonish
picture
of
the
human
block
head
doing
his
thing
but
i
dont
want
to
spoil
it
for
you
make
sure
you
take
a
look
if
you
can
find
it
o
i
havent
had
samichlaus
from
them
but
this
is
a
decent
start
which
it
probably
was
from
them
like
the
sammichlaus
classic
too
sweet
purchased
in
villach
at
a
eurospar
taste
palate
all
the
sweet
notes
from
the
aroma
come
though
in
the
flavor
plus
a
note
of
cherry
almond
ring
coffee
cake
and
the
mellow
glow
of
a
warming

abv
the
feel
is
slick
and
smooth
as
there
is
very
little
carbonation
its
like
drinking
liquid
candy
this
austrian
doppelbock
pours
a
clear
antique
gold
with
a
tall
white
head
that
quickly
vanishes
leaving
some
moderate
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
vaguely
sherry
like
with
little
in
the
way
of
complexity
the
same
goes
for
the
flavor
which
while
pleasant
enough
has
no
character
from
either
the
hops
or
malt
its
a
sweet
very
strong
beer
no
more
or
less
medium
body
sticky
overall
tasty
and
drinkable
enough
for
its
strength
it
doesnt
have
enough
interesting
character
to
be
truly
outstanding
but
its
a
wellenough
wrought
beer

i
usually
dont
like
very
sweet
malty
beers
but
this
is
actually
a
pleasant
sipper
last
time
i
had
it
was
almost
2
years
ago
this
was
felt
much
better
and
probably
was
not
the
beer
that
changed
o
not
overly
complex
but
still
delicious
and
i
cant
believe
all
the
low
ratings
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
good
clarity
and
fat
creamy
off
white
head
that
stays
and
stays
nose
is
strong
with
malt
richness
and
depth
like
ribbons
of
scent
from
malt
but
nothing
burnt
or
roasted
just
sweet
no
hops
on
the
nose
but
a
nice
light
fruitiness
sheeting
lace
that
slides
back
into
the
ring
and
alcohol
legs
some
grape
like
sweetness
a
bit
of
sweet
chocolate
comes
forward
shyly
as
it
warms
the
fruit
on
the
nose
is
a
mere
grapey
sweetness
light
and
bright
taste
is
heavenly
delight
rich
sweet
malt
unfolds
on
the
palate
light
chocolate
clean
tastes
and
a
grape
like
sweetness
that
includes
a
bit
of
sweet
raisin
type
depth
toasty
but
nothing
burnt
no
hop
flavor
until
the
very
end
where
it
finishes
with
a
timid
bitter
and
a
little
more
of
that
chocolate
to
linger
in
the
aftertaste
medium
full
body
smooth
and
wonderful
a
strange
one
to
call
nothing
bad
at
all
but
ill
never
have
another
one
overall
solid
sugar
bomb
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
didnt
find
this
type
of
sugar
particularly
tasteful
but
definitely
worth
a
try
a
pale
doppelbock
described
as
the
cognac
of
the
beer
world
on
the
label
it
is
indeed
pale
a
bright
sparkly
lemon
drop
yellow
with
around
three
inches
of
white
foam
aroma
is
intensely
sweet
and
bready
with
ample
lager
yeast
character
and
green
grape
must
palate
does
indeed
evoke
cognac
a
little
but
is
of
course
much
sweeter
tastes
of
golden
cake
with
icing
apples
a
poppy
seed
nuttiness
and
dried
plums
esters
and
phenols
abound
with
a
pervasive
mustiness
that
recalls
white
wine
hops
provide
some
additional
fruit
notes
like
gooseberry
and
some
bitterness
to
the
finish
which
is
more
crisp
dry
and
spicy
than
the
initial
sweetness
would
suggest
boozy
like
many
belgian
tripels
and
some
of
the
other
flavors
go
down
this
path
as
well
although
this
lager
beer
is
much
sweeter
than
the
more
attenuated
belgian
ale
i
like
darker
flavors
in
this
style
but
this
is
worth
sampling
very
good
drinkable
not
a
kick
in
the
teeth
in
any
area
i
like
the
balance
in
this
one
a
nice
gold
color
not
much
head
but
there
was
some
active
carbonation
a
nice
fruit
like
smell
citrus
fruit
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
i
cant
really
describe
the
taste
other
than
i
liked
it
the
beer
had
a
thick
texture
like
cream
i
felt
a
little
alcohol
warmth
o
nice
beer
for
food
pairing
definitely
a
slow
sipper
o
if
you
do
not
like
hops
you
will
probably
like
this
beer
hell
its
almost
like
an
english
barleywine
i
really
like
samichlaus
their
christmas
beer
of
course
it
is
always
available
at
our
local
total
wine
more
im
sad
this
brewery
is
done
i
bet
they
make
a
few
more
huh
abv
beers
that
are
just
loaded
with
sweetness
this
bottle
is
well
done
if
you
like
beer
that
are
sweet
and
hide
the
booze
grab
a
bottle
not
sure
its
worth
5
99
but
man
this
is
tasty
cheers
o
pretty
good
stuff
an
interesting
take
on
doppelbocks
overall
eh
nice
abv
im
buzzed
after
this
and
the
12
bomber
taste
is
just
okay
overall
is
just
okay
note
again
the
high
marks
for
smell
but
this
is
not
what
i
consider
in
the
same
class
as
a
spaten
optimator
or
celebrator
or
most
of
the
other
doppels
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
this
beer
has
a
ton
of
complex
flavor
and
aroma
and
enough
alcohol
to
make
it
interesting
easy
drinking
as
an
aperitif
after
four
years
in
the
cellar
while
not
quite
to
style
this
one
is
very
enjoyable
and
more
similar
to
a
tripple
o
picked
this
up
since
i
am
a
big
samichlaus
fan
but
this
one
left
me
wanting
a
unique
beer
but
not
sure
if
it
fits
the
style
so
rated
a
bit
lower
due
to
that
taste
is
lots
of
fruit
raisiny
bread
crust
lemony
herbal
bitterness
hints
of
spice
its
creamy
but
lively
not

not

engaging
zesty

round
it

on

this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
fairly
strong
overall
not
a
classic
doppelbock
of
germanaustrian
descent
having
a
look
at
the
website
especially
the
strong
beer
variants
including
this
one
seem
to
be

despite

an

overall
again
the
beer
is
not

it

feeling

no

but
malty
goodness
there
is
no
fruit
that
i
can
detect
maybe
a
prune
or
two
but
barely
quite
a
pleasant
doppelbock
different
than
others
ive
tried
o
overall
this
turned
out
to
be
very
impressive
more
so
than
their
samichlaus
the
3
years
of
ageing
neglecting
the
expiry
date
have
really
added
a
nice
touch
to
the
beer
and
transformed
the
mouthfeel
o
disappointing
i
made
some
really
good
finds
in
that
bar
basement
selloff
this
was
not
one
of
them
overall
austrias
duvel
if
you
will
its
bright
in
color
fairly
strong
carbonation
decent
balance
abv
is
well
hidden
and
itdefinitely
gets
the
job
done
o
a
decent
enough
beer
but
the
flavours
are
a
little
strange
and
really
dont
work
as
a
doppelbock
and
the
alcohol
stands
out
a
little
too
much
overall
a
very
strange
take
on
the
style
with
an
excess
of
sweetness
that
i
enjoy
but
not
very
much
of
a
rum
raisin
bread
that
i
would
expect
still
it
wasnt
bad
sadly
was
forced
to
pour
the
last
4
oz
or
so
out
and
immediately
open
and
crush
a
can
of
avery
ipa
it
took
over
half
of
the
can
to
get
the
cloying
sweetness
out
of
my
mouth
ack
o
this
is
the
first
pale
double
bock
that
i
have
ever
tried
and
i
liked
it
very
different
and
interesting
despite
how
smooth
the
beer
is
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
finish
of
this
beer
may
turn
off
some
people
overall
a
big
beer
with
mild
flavors
but
the
force
is
strong
with
this
one
alcohol
reigns
supreme
consider
my
night
capped
o
a
great
choice
for
a
snifter
worthy
warmer
light
body
but
surprisingly
thick
for
the
appearance
not
a
horrible
beer
but
it
seems
like
a
weird
highpowered
mix
of
a
bock
and
pale
euro
lager
euro
malt
liquor
maybe
yikes
castles
and
counts
blah
blah
blah
the
big
abv
is
just
barely
integrated
and
were
thus
given
a
bit
of
breathing
room
beyond
the
sweet
grainy
malt
that
said
the
near
10
full
points
of
booze
are
somehow
easy
to
sup
away
at
once
you
become
acclimatized
worth
it
if
your
goal
is
getting
all
warm
and
toasty
without
actually
gagging
on
the
low
rent
brewer
having
cut
too
many
a
corner
not
the
best
offering
from
this
brewermind
you
ive
only
tried
samiclaus
but
at
3
bucks
a
bottle
i
had
little
to
lose
somewhat
palatable
in
small
doses
this
walks
that
fine
line
between
crafted
beer
and
malt
liquor
it
strikes
me
as
a
bock
that
would
be
very
well
balanced
at
a
lower
abv
while
the
alcohol
seems
to
dominate
and
throw
things
off
as
it
is
now
i
change
my
assessment
of
this
being
a
sexed
up
maibock
its
more
of
a
rocketfueled
maibock
o
just
soso
sadly
there
are
better
cheaper
doppelbocks
around
though
this
is
certainly
not
bad
especially
if
you
want
something
boozy
o
nice
powefull
beer
that
is
a
littel
boozy
but
does
not
detract
from
its
powerfull
flavours
had
a
bottle
of
this
in
november
of
2007
i
believe
this
was
one
of
the
first
doppelbocks
i
ever
had
with
that
being
said
i
was
totally
unprepaired
for
the
impact
this
beer
would
have
on
my
tastebuds
this
beer
smelled
very
sweet
infact
i
was
really
happy
about
that
the
color
was
like
burnt
caremel
with
some
yellow
around
the
sides
for
me
the
flavors
in
this
beer
were
really
strong
at
the
time
that
i
had
it
i
was
concerned
that
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
finish
i
sucked
it
up
and
did
but
had
mixed
emotions
about
his
beer
i
havent
had
it
since
and
really
should
revisit
this
brew
again
its
worth
trying
again
in
a
way
urbock
23
is
sort
of
like
a
lighter
cheaper
but
by
no
means
cheap
samichlaus
it
doesnt
have
the
same
overthetop
intensity
of
samichlaus
but
it
hits
like
a
train
both
in
its
flavor
and
its
alcohol
content
nonetheless
an
excellent
beer
but
at
17
for
four
its
seriously
expensive
highly
recommended
the
alcohol
is
reasonable
hidden
i
am
taking
a
few
home
bham
uk
march
2011
d
complex
flavors
but
a
sipper
oak
and
booze
too
much
definite
sipper
drink
is
meh
pretty
heavy
drinking
big
body
some
warming
and
tingly
booze
and
the
sharp
contrast
in
flavors
from
sweet
syrupy
wheat
wine
to
bitter
spicy
pale
hop
flavors
seems
to
play
not
so
well
in
fact
it
reminds
me
of
mead
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
hops
and
alcohol
floral
honey
cotton
candy
light
lemon
and
earthiness
are
all
present
staggeringly
drier
than
i
remember
it
being
the
sweetness
actually
isnt
all
that
high
the
combination
of
hops
and
alcohol
is
unique
and
the
malt
character
is
moderate
and
in
its
simplicity
like
a
drier
maibock
the
yeast
isnt
particularly
expressive
i
dont
get
much
yeast
flavor
here
despite
the
relatively
high
fg
1
020
this
is
still
fairly
dry
moderately
brash
this
still
works
medium
in
body
with
carbonation
thats
a
little
higher
than
it
needs
to
be
this
beer
is
dry
and
hoppy
on
the
finish
with
some
cotton
candy
a
failure
as
a
doppelbock
this
is
still
quite
an
excellent
beverage
tastes
like
sweet
bread
and
caramel
really
clean
taste
thats
crisp
and
clean
not
that
complex
but
a
good
taste
i
am
not
sure
how
old
this
bottle
is
because
i
cant
taste
the
booze
at
all
it
might
be
aged
and
mellowed
enjoyable
beer
for
somebody
who
normally
doesnt
drink
lagers
it
is
a
great
beer
from
an
outstanding
brewery
d
high
abv
and
lacking
flavor
makes
this
one
a
tough
one
to
drink
for
the
label
calling
it
the
congac
of
beers
not
impressed
pours
a
light
golden
body
with
good
head
and
a
strong
aroma
that
has
some
booziness
to
it
as
well
as
dark
fruits
and
some
sweetness
for
a
dopplebock
it
doesnt
seem
as
heavy
or
boozy
as
others
which
is
both
good
and
bad
the
lighter
body
is
crisp
with
some
hoppiness
and
a
slight
sticky
sweetness
cant
pinpoint
sweetness
but
its
something
like
caramel
and
for
some
reason
i
pick
something
like
raisins
or
figs
finishes
slightly
dry
w
the
alcohol
finally
making
itself
known
a
quality
sipper
wont
be
confused
w
the
more
maltier
dopplebocks
when
it
comes
to
a
heavy
malt
presence
but
still
a
good
tasting
brew
worth
trying
d
the
alcohol
is
masked
to
some
degree
so
it
doesnt
quite
taste
like
9
6
and
isnt
as
difficult
to
drink
as
one
would
expect
an
elegant
clean
and
well
crafted
doppelbock
perhaps
a
bit
too
clean
overall
i
agree
with
others
in
that
this
isnt
all
that
close
to
a
doppelbock
its
more
of
a
maibock
but
the
abv
is
too
high
to
support
that
kind
of
flavor
profile
dthe
taste
stays
but
it
becomes
more
and
more
undesirable
as
you
drink
it
you
could
drink
this
beer
and
then
five
different
beers
after
it
but
you
will
never
get
the
taste
of
this
out
of
your
mouth
abv
hits
quickly
d
highly
drinkable
due
to
the
smooth
nature
of
this
brew
prost
d
a
fantastic
strong
lager
beer
samichlaus
light
perhaps
but
it
has
the
flavour
profile
and
intensity
to
hang
with
that
beer
a
nightcap
beer
for
sure
a
must
try
d
the
booziness
to
this
one
really
hurts
the
drinkability
almost
makes
me
think
im
chugging
a
mixed
drink
not
my
favorite
this
brew
tastes
fairly
decent
though
there
is
still
too
much
of
an
alcohol
presence
the
beer
is
surprisingly
thin
with
some
mild
heat
in
the
finish
urbock
23
has
a
slightly
odd
or
off
kilter
flavor
overall
its
pretty
drinkable
but
also
a
tad
unusual
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
mediocre
beer
overall
an
uncomplicated
and
average
beer
thats
a
bit
more
of
a
golden
or
maibock
if
you
love
dopplebocks
its
worth
having
at
least
once
i
can
see
why
some
people
are
put
off
by
it
though
especially
if
you
are
into
complex
belgian
beers
nothing
really
blew
me
away
i
wouldnt
pay
the
cost
again
for
this
beer
given
the
high
price
it
has
in
the
usa
its
sweet
but
oddly
thin
its
very
very
thin
mild
ethanol
on
the
front
palate
and
lots
of
sweetness
in
the
mid
to
forward
palate
the
beer
finishes
oddly
bitter
its
smooth
and
drinkable
but
its
not
my
favorite
doppelbock
not
by
a
long
shot
its
a
good
beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
because
of
the
brewery
alone
i
would
drink
it
again
but
if
i
had
a
choice
between
this
and
another
doppelbock
i
would
likely
try
the
other
d
a
decent
dopplebock
some
nice
smooth
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
fruit
would
try
again
slightly
complex
big
full
bodied
longlagered
beer
that
any
beer
drinker
has
to
appreciate
d
sweetness
and
heavier
body
makes
this
more
of
a
sipper
d
a
rich
warm
bock
that
hides
its
alchohol
well
with
lots
of
rich
malt
quality
a
touch
slick
on
the
mouthfeel
lets
if
down
not
as
clean
as
it
should
be
but
certainly
very
enjoyable
its
amusing
that
this
calls
itself
the
cognac
of
beers
when
it
doesnt
have
nearly
the
power
complexity
or
pleasant
flavour
of
a
good
brandy
all
it
has
is
a
distinct
alcohol
finish
not
a
pleasant
drop
i
really
have
very
very
little
respect
for
the
brauerei
schloss
eggenberg
they
are
all
talk
and
no
substance
this
is
an
insult
to
other
doppelbocks
undrinkable
this
smacks
of
brewing
apathy
and
comes
across
as
cheap
hot
piss
to
get
you
wasted
quickly
the
similarities
between
it
and
say
jordanian
10
rocket
fuel
are
striking
please
let
me
not
finish
it
pours
to
a
clear
ambercopper
color
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
alcoholic
almost
like
a
fine
wine
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
dry
but
i
tend
to
like
beers
like
that
there
is
a
sweet
flavor
with
bits
of
caramel
and
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
overwhelming
to
the
other
flavors
there
is
also
an
oak
undertone
possibly
from
the
barrels
d
although
the
higher
abv
is
detectable
it
is
still
fairly
easy
to
drink
drinkability
runs
high
i
could
enjoy
two
or
three
of
these
o
good
drinkability
despite
the
high
abv
i
was
expecting
much
less
from
this
beer
good
surprise
d
enough
complexity
to
try
this
one
again
pretty
smooth
for
a
9
60
abv
so
a
few
of
these
and
youd
be
on
the
floor
if
youre
not
careful
d
with
such
a
high
abv
more
than
one
of
these
can
spell
trouble
even
so
the
abv
is
hidden
so
well
it
could
definitely
be
sneaky
otherwise
its
a
nice
alternative
to
a
traditional
doppelbock
for
those
who
like
that
style
and
want
to
try
something
a
bit
different
not
a
fan
of
this
one
i
love
the
style
but
i
find
with
doppelbocks
you
have
the
elites
and
everything
else
doesnt
measure
up
and
this
one
falls
in
the
2nd
category
nice
malty
brew
enjoyed
it
mouthfeel
is
thin
no
carbonation
and
some
alcohol
presence
drinkability
is
not
that
good
i
would
take
on
if
offered
as
a
nightcap
or
winter
evening
libation
but
there
are
much
better
options
if
i
was
seeking
one
out
i
got
this
along
with
many
other
great
beers
for
christmas
i
would
have
this
beer
any
day
drinkability
hides
the
printed
9
6
abv
very
well
lil
dubious
about
that
number
to
be
honest
if
you
like
this
you
could
put
quite
a
few
away
quickly
this
beers
only
real
saving
grace
is
its
drinkability
andor
as
a

that
goes
away

not
much
lacing
at
all
aroma
is

malty
it
smells
like

and
bready
malt
toffee
apples
and
honey
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
except
that
there
is
some
booze
noticable
and
theres
also
a
slight
bitter
herbal
taste
in
the

mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
sticky
and
creamy
with
moderate

the

enough
its
not

to
drink
overall
i
think
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
there
are
other
dopplebocks
i
like
more
than
this
one
but
it
is
worth
a
try
my
first
beer
of
the
helles
doppelbock
style
and
i
really
enjoy
it
perfect
for
relaxing
on
the
deck
on
a
cool
fall
afternoon
d
moderate
to
low
high
abv
and
cognac
taste
will
keep
me
to
the
1
overall
a
beer
with
a
unique
taste
overall
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
pellet
although
the
alcohol
is
relatively
well
hidden
after
the
beer
warms
up
a
bit
it
becomes
way
too
dominant
conclusively
a
couple
of
nips
of
this
beer
ok
but
drinking
a
whole
glass
of
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
much
well
on
this
bottle
they
call
this
the
cognac
of
beers
i
think
ill
be
the
judge
of
thatit
pours
a
see
thru
pale
amber
colour
with
little
carbonation
that
leaves
a
fast
vanishing
head
with
no
lacing
just
a
little
ring
around
the
edgeit
has
a
funky
apple
malty
smell
to
it
not
too
sure
what
to
make
of
that
aromait
has
a
thin
mouthfeel
and
tastes
kinda
like
sweet
apples
infused
with
alcohol
but
not
a
dominant
alcohol
taste
just
enough
to
give
you
that
little
bit
of
warmth
that
a
white
port
does
at
the
finish
so
i
can
maybe
see
where
they
are
trying
to
get
as
saying
its
the
cognac
of
beers
but
it
still
just
doesnt
get
me
that
excited
reallybecause
of
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
drinkability
for
me
isnt
the
highest
but
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
as
an
after
desert
beer
but
thats
it
for
me
d
although
the
alcohol
is
very
upfront
in
this
beer
it
remains
drinkable
the
flavours
are
quite
complex
and
there
may
have
been
flavours
that
i
didnt
manage
to
decipher
this
time
round
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
pours
a
clear

with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
drops
quickly
smells
completely
of
pears
apples
sugar
and
alcohol

overthetop

tastes
like
a
shot

two
of
everclear
mixed
with
apple
juice
though
theres
some
breadiness
sticky
syrupy
body
down
the
drain
it
goes

the
alcohol
hits
slightly
course
to
start
and
then
transitions
to
a
creamy
texture
before
a
slightly
dry
finish
the
carbonation
is
mediumlow
which
suits
the
beer
well
d
an
interesting
unique
beer
for
sure
i
enjoyed
it
as
a
change
of
pace
but
i
hesitate
to
say
that
its
particularly
outstanding
worth
a
try
at
any
rate
d
could
be
very
high
but
you
feel
and
taste
the
alcohol
after
a
while
also
it
s
a
bit
acidic
after
a
while
in
other
words
could
be
a
5
but
is
more
like
a

down

cant

the
flavor

with

of
beers
i
would
have
another
drinkabilty
its
a
good
beer
not
a
great
one
but
a
good
one
the
flavor
makes
up
of
the
mouthfeel
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth

flat
and
somewhat
syrupy

this
beer
can
be
a
little
hot

some
aging
will
do
wonders
this
review
was
done
in
jun

which
matches
the
best

on
the
bottle
drinkability
a
real
disappointment
goes
back
and
forth
between
being
sickly
sweet
at
times
and
unpleasantly
hot
regrettably
its
like
the
malt
liquor
of
dopplebocks
strong
alcohol
bite
to
the
swallow
more

than
most
doppelbocks

still
retains

i
consider
a

but
this
one
qualifies
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
with
an
extremely
low
carbonation
fine
example
though
i
think
it
is
more
of
a
helles
bock
than
a
traditional
doppel
ill
try
this
again
at
some
point
in
the
future
in
case
my
tastes
evolve
but
currently
im
not
looking
forward
to
it
eggenberg
has
better
offerings
like
samichlaus
which
has
a
higher
alcohol
percent
but
so
much
more
beer
like
still
not
a
fan
though
this
one
is
needless
to
say
a
bit
disappointing
it
may
be
a
little
old
but
it
didnt
do
a
lot
or
me
and
the
elements
were
scattered
next
eggenbergs
take
on
the
doppelbock
style
isnt
particularly
to
my
liking
they
come
in
as
far
too
sweet
and
not
nearly
bready
enough
this
is
probably
my
final
attempt
at
a
beer
from
these
guys
scott
the
bjcp
beer
judge
certification
program
lists
urbock
23º
as
a
notable
commercial
example
of
the
dopplebock
style
im
not
entirely
sure
why
i
know
that
paler
versions
can
exist
but
this
didnt
exactly
exhibit
all
that
is
great
with
this
rich
german
style
eggenberg
says
this
is
known
in
many
countries
as
the
cognac
of
beers
while
it
does
taste
a
little
similar
it
certainly
doesnt
share
one
bit
of
the
complexity
or
elegance
d
overall
this
is
not
a
horrible
brew
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
way
to
sweet
for
me
to
enjoy
md
syrupyrich
on
the
palate
but
the
smooth
carbonation
remains
the
refreshing
input
to
keep
the
balance
right
and
the
alc

6abv
really
is
surprisingly
wellhidden
having
tried
only
a
couple
of
eisbockdoppelbock
i
must
say
i
find
this
one
a
very
wellmade
bock
benefiting
from
a
sound
body
and
supreme
balance
not
a
wow
kind
of
beer
in
my
book
but
really
i
cant
doubt
the
integrity
of
the
overall
performance
at
all
and
can
surely
kill
a
few
bottles
when
my
budget
allows
it
appearance
is
very
clear
and
a
bit
lighter
than
expected
carbonation
is
almost
nil
aroma
is
very
boozy
flavor
is
the
same
and
very
sweet
dried
cherries
dried
pear
sweet
aftertaste
taste
of
alcohol
is
substantial
drinks
almost
like
a

it
is
certainly
not
a
session
beer
and
they
are
kidding
themselves
with
the
one
of
the
strongest
beers
in
the
world
line
especially
when
they
make
a
14
monster
themselves
but
it
is
a
good
sipper
a
nicely
balanced
end
of
the
night
brew
pours
a
clear
yellow
that
borders
on
orange
with
very
little
in
the
way
of
head
thanks
this
beer
bleeds
alcohol
fumes
so
much
that
it
almost
burns
the
eyes
and
nose
seriously
the
overwhelming
alcoholic
action
detracts
from
what
might
otherwise
be
an
excellent
beer
it
has
fruity
sweet
aromas
its
interesting
that
and
earthy
herbaceous
hops
are
detectable
on
the
nose
but
not
so
much
on
the
palate
tastes
of
a
carmelly
syrupy
sweetness
with
too
much
alcohol
its
smooth
full
body
is
its
best
characteristic
an
interesting
beer
with
some
jagged
edges
worth
trying
overall
a
nice
sipping
beer
good
for
sampling
but
too
basic
to
justify
the
price
for
a
small
glass
overall
i
would
not
classify
this
as
a
doppelbock
more
of
a
belgium
ale
d
okay
drinkability
different
per
style
but
really
sweet
and
sugary
with
a
dose
of
alcohol
may
limit
repeats
a
decent
try
but
wouldnt
bother
having
seconds
on
this
one
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
fades
leaving
no
lacing
has
a
sweet
alcohol
and
roasted
malty
aroma
strong
alcohol
flavor
with
sweet
hints
of
caramel
chocolate
coffee
toffee
and
slight
nut
presence
very
pleasant
very
quaffable
interpretation
as
is
the
case
with
most
bocks
this
was
not
very
carbonated
had
a
syrupy
consistency
was
very
sweet
had
loads
of
caramelized
malts
licorice
flavors
some
spiciness
in
the
finish
and
very
nice
warming
abv
that
was
not
strong
nor
throaty
the
beer
was
liqueur
like
in
its
character
with
some
anise
and
licorice
flavors
this
was
an
exceptional
sipping
beer
that
although
strong
was
well
masked
in
alcohol
content
what
a
great
find
lchaim
this
poured
a
bright
clear
gold
with
a
bit
of
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
honey
wheat
molasses
and
sour
apple
with
a
bit
of
wild
yeast
and
lemon
grass
it
tasted
like
honey
wheat
and
rich
barley
with
a
bit
of
lemon
hops
and
yeast
it
was
watery
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
initially
seemed
very
similar
to
the
eggengerg
dunkel
but
the
more
i
deconstructed
it
the
more
differences
i
found
this
was
much
lighter
especially
for
a
doppelbock
but
it
was
still
quite
tasty
very
clean
and
super
easy
to
drink
it
had
decent
body
and
hid
the
alcohol
very
well
i
probably
prefer
the
darkness
and
complexity
of
the
dunkel
but
this
was
still
a
great
beer
edit
fixed
a
typo
built
for
sippin
not
for
quaffing
best
suited
as
a
slow
after
dinner
beer
and
consumed
as
a
one
off
passable
but
not
to
my
taste
i
bought
this
sweet
baby
down
at
the
headkeeper
in
greensburg
i
saw
that
it
was
brewed
by
the
same
people
that
brought
me
my
wonderful
samichlaus
so
i
figured
id
give
it
a
try
i
poured
an
11
2
oz
bottle
into
my
tasting
snifter
at
just
below
40
or
so
degrees
there
was
a
small
white
head
that
disappeared
as
soon
as
the
bottle
was
completely
emptied
the
beer
was
crystal
clear
no
sediment
in
the
glass
and
a
rubyorange
color
the
aroma
was
a
bit
musky
with
a
fair
bit
of
hops
and
malt
in
the
background
the
taste
was
pleasant
a
bit
bitter
and
very
little
carbonation
with
an
alcohol
content
of
9
6
you
can
hardly
taste
the
alcohol
in
it
a
good
beer
overall
will
probably
recommend
it
to
fellow
drinkers
in
the
future
drinkability
im
neither
rushing
out
to
get
another
one
nor
will
i
be
quick
to
recommend
this
one
i
agree
it
seems
to
be
incorrectly
classified
on
this
an
other
websites
as
a
doppelbock
and
if
anything
it
should
be
considered
a
helles
bock
or
maybe
a
euro
strong
lager
given
the
high
abv
drinkability
well
this
is
a
fairly
strong
brew
so
i
dont
think
i
could
handle
more
than
maybe
two
in
a
sitting
its
warming
and
thick
enough
to
discourage
a
long
drinking
session
all
in
all
this
urbock
is
a
nice
coldweather
beer
but
you
probably
wont
want
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
glass
at
the
saloon
in
dc
this
is
certainly
an
interesting
and
unique
beer
i
had
this
beer
a
week
ago
so
this
is
a
very
limited
review
however
i
remember
it
being
very
vinious
lots
of
fusel
alcohol
in
the
smell
and
taste
winelike
and
especially
meadlike
sweet
honey
apple
maybe
some
balancing
spices
a
moderately
slick
mouthfeel
very
boozy
and
some
spices
that
actually
if
i
remember
correclty
reminded
me
of
samichlaus
some
sprucey
and
fig
notes
not
up
my
alley
something
i
would
like
to
present
to
my
dad
however
who
loves
meade
and
avoids
beer
the
eggenberg
doppelbock
dunkel
was
amazing
though
this
beer
for
me
fun
as
it
may
be
is
not
as
fulfilling
as
a
trappist
tripel
og
a
nice
dipa
interesting
beer
but
i
am
not
sure
i
would
like
to
drink
this
one
too
often
looks
sure
can
be
deceiving
eggenberg
sure
enjoys
their
high
abv
beers
contrary
to
other
reviews
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
far
from
your
average
doppelbock
a
sampling
of
this
one
once
in
a
while
will
do
it
for
me
quite
a
dlicious
lager
but
seems
more
like
a
maibock
than
a
dobblebock
very
sweet
and
somewhat
thin
combined
with
9
6
abv
make
this
one
for
certain
occasions
only
not
a
bad
beerjust
off
on
style
drinkability
this
wasnt
very
good
its
an
odd
style
and
an
even
more
odd
taste
this
certainly
isnt
a
dopplebock
best
way
to
drink
this
beer
is
by
pouring
it
out
drinkability
boo
this
beer
this
is
not
a
doppelbock
maybe
they
put
a
label
on
the
wrong
beer
maybe
they
havent
heard
of
a
doppelbock
they
just
decided
to
brew
one
and
call
it
a
doppelbock
yeah
im
not
buying
that
either
destroy
all
remaining
stores
of
this
beer
d
with
the
booze
as
noticeable
as
it
is
this
is
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
but
this
seems
to
be
a
tendency
for
some
beers
in
this
style
given
that
i
found
this
to
be
an
enjoyable
doppelbock
but
i
dont
see
myself
getting
this
again
spicy
strong
and
a
little
sweet
but
overall
decent
the
beer
goes
down
smoothly
i
suppose
its
drinkable
but
someone
with
some
experience
with
beer
knows
a
beer
at
9
2
often
make
things
happen
almost
2
times
as
fast
as
a
5
beer
i
suspect
candy
sugar
was
used
as
part
of
this
beers
ingrediants
its
not
bad
but
i
just
couldnt
bring
myself
to
finish
the
whole
bottle
one
snifter
was
enough
i
tried
this
beer
on
march
12
2008
after
purchasing
it
from
my
one
of
my
local
lcbo
outlets
the
beer
poured
an
orangygold
colour
into
the
glass
with
a
12
inch
white
head
that
quickly
disappeared
the
aroma
was
sweet
malt
some
caramel
and
some
grass
the
mouthfeel
was
thinbodied
and
medium
carbonated
the
flavour
was
sweet
malt
with
some
milky
hints
not
all
that
enjoyable
a
dopplebock
pours
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
reasonable
amount
of
light
lacy
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
the
color
is
a
bit
more
honey
than
a
pilsner
or
a
light
lager
like
stella
the
taste
is
not
as
sweet
as
i
was
expecting
after
reading
the
other
reviews
here
although
that
is
present
at
first
taste
it
is
very
full
bodied
and
has
much
more
flavor
than
you
expect
from
such
a
light
colored
beer
but
very
soon
that
dissolves
to
quite
a
light
mouthfeel
and
a
flavor
dominated
by
the
alcohol
and
an
aftertaste
that
reminds
me
subtly
of
mead
330ml
bottle
purchased
from
lcbo
in
toronto
pours
a
poor
fizzy
pale
gold
little
head
and
no
lacing
decent
malty
aroma
first
taste
is
sweet
very
sweet
the
taste
remains
syrupy
throughout
the
malts
dont
balance
out
the
sweetness
and
the
hops
are
not
noticeable
not
an
enjoyable
beer
i
found
the
taste
a
little
unbalanced
sweetness
and
alcohol
are
the
most
evident
but
the
mild
fruitiness
is
nice
i
had
higher
expectations
for
this
one
dont
know
why
but
i
did
weird
looking
definitely
didnt
realize
this
one
was
a
doppelbock
pours
like
a
krystalweizen
crystal
clear
with
visible
bubbles
and
a
weak
head
light
copper
color
i
am
confused
nose
is
very
tasty
lots
of
sweet
malt
spiciness
alcohol
taste
is
likewise
crazy
sweet
which
i
actually
like
but
tons
of
spice
and
alcohol
in
there
as
well
not
a
doppelbock
flavor
to
be
honest
but
not
bad
bodys
a
little
thin
carbonations
a
little
high
well
ill
be
honest
i
had
this
one
rated
a
lot
higher
when
i
didnt
realize
its
supposed
style
not
bad
but
doesnt
fit
with
the
style
in
the
least
seems
more
like
an
ale
actually
d
at
9
6
this
is
a
fairly
stiff
drinker
and
the
alcohol
content
is
fairly
upfront
d
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
didnt
look
like
most
dopplebocks
or
taste
like
one
but
it
was
good
drinkability
this
is
an
exceptionally
unpleasant
doppelbock
avoid
d
not
bad
there
is
some
measure
of
balance
in
this
to
counter
the
huge
alcohol
tastes
like
a
very
sweet
maibock
extreme
beer
euro
style
drinkability
is
ok
the
alcohol
stays
hidden
fairly
well
only
showing
itself
as
a
gentle
spreading
warmth
by
about
half
way
through
the
bottle
it
also
got
worse
as
it
warmed
and
i
ended
up
dumping
about
half
of
it
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
one
there
are
plenty
of
better
doppelbocks
out
there
from
an
11
2
oz
olive
bottle
that
lacks
a
freshness
date
the
beer
pours
a
crystalclear
yellowtinged
orange
with
low
carbonation
its
capped
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
that
reduces
to
a
collar
and
doesnt
really
lace
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
enticing
and
chock
full
of
fruits
apples
white
grapes
apricots
peaches
dried
banana
and
hints
of
candy
corn
pretty
similar
on
the
palate
with
the
addition
of
oranges
melon
late
greengrassy
hops
and
a
light
dosing
of
alcohol
not
as
sweet
as
i
would
have
thought
based
on
the
bouquet
but
this
is
a
good
thing
and
the
fairly
smooth
tingly
and
dry
medium
body
supplies
a
nice
base
i
dont
think
ive
ever
tried
a
helles
dopplebock
but
this
brew
is
interesting
and
tasty
definitely
worth
a
try
an
ok
strong
lager
probably
on
the
light
end
of
the
scale
for
a
doppelbock
in
color
and
maltiness
worth
a
try
for
sure
but
not
as
good
as
samichlaus
pours
on
the
very
light
side
of
a
doppelbock
a
crystal
clear
golden
yellow
color
not
much
of
a
head
is
formed
about
an
eighth
of
an
inch
with
okay
tracing
the
aroma
is
really
intriguing
lots
of
caramel
coated
fruit
very
little
to
no
roastiness
just
a
light
toasted
wheat
note
overall
the
aroma
seems
just
too
fruity
for
the
style
but
again
this
is
on
the
lighter
color
and
perhaps
its
more
appropriate
on
the
palate
it
is
incredibly
rich
and
sweet
it
reminds
me
more
of
samiclaus
than
any
other
doppelbock
there
is
a
little
toasted
flavor
but
it
just
isnt
like
any
other
doppel
carbonation
is
very
low
providing
a
very
thick
viscous
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
what
i
would
call
close
to
a
white
port
though
i
havent
drank
one
alcohol
is
quite
apparent
but
not
overbearing
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
and
see
how
its
flavors
mirror
a
lot
from
experimental
brewers
like
sam
calagione
and
the
folks
at
avery
this
is
a
decently
drinkable
beer
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
but
good
nonetheless
fairly
complex
but
not
as
much
as
other
beers
drinkability
sure
enough
i
sucked
the
last
little
droplet
out
of
my
glass
and
then
nursed
the
bottle
for
the
vapors
so
i
could
quaff
a
few
bottles
of
this
in
a
sitting
but
the
9
6
abv
made
itself
known
still
when
i
consider
the
whole
astmd
scenario
there
are
other
bock
biers
that
produce
a
greater
satisfaction
in
my
beerlover
tummy
prost
beertracker
overall
the
oxidation
is
disappointing
but
the
underlying
beer
is
still
excellent
complex
and
smooth
an
excellent
golden
doppelbock
m
d
semiheavy
mouthfeel
but
not
too
thick
carbonation
settles
over
the
tongue
i
would
gladly
have
a
couple
or
more
of
these
but
im
sure
the
alcohol
would
catch
me
off
guard
so
its
one
to
excercise
some
restraint
with
if
that
can
be
done
its
a
good
call
the
feel
of
this
one
is
just
too
harsh
especially
for
the
style
i
can
only
take
a
sip
each
time
almost
like
a
strong
barleywine
or
an
overthetop
strong
ale
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
considering
my
style
which
made
it
fun
because
of
the
alcohol
level
in
this
beer
went
down
smooth
and
it
was
very
tasty
the
alcohol
does
let
itself
known
loud
and
clear
giving
it
a
boozy
character
it
is
unique
fits
into
the
style
in
a
broad
sense
a
wonderful
sipping
dessert
brew
pours
very
clear
and
light
for
a
doppelbock
its
really
more
pilsner
colored
no
head
to
speak
of
though
thats
no
surprise
given
the
abv
aromas
are
quite
sweet
with
a
honeyish
character
in
the
background
and
candied
stone
fruits
up
front
theres
a
hint
of
drying
spice
underneath
everything
and
a
slight
hop
presence
that
comes
out
only
at
higher
temperatures
on
the
palate
things
start
out
with
a
touch
of
overdone
sweetness
then
hop
bitterness
and
then
an
astringent
spiciness
that
leaves
a
bitter
aftertaste
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
zippy
and
light
overall
ill
say
about
this
exactly
what
i
say
about
samichlaus
it
aint
a
doppelbock
first
of
all
however
whereas
samichlaus
especially
with
some
age
shows
some
softness
and
depth
of
flavor
in
the
fruit
column
this
beer
has
none
of
that
maybe
it
will
come
with
time
but
for
now
this
is
only
middling
classy
looking

had
from
eggenberg
is
the
famed
samichlaus
and
its
actually
got
a
similar
feel
im
wondering
if
it
has
to
do
with
the
yeast
strain
in
any
case
its
very
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
for
such
a
high
abv
stylistically
i
just
dont
see
anything
doppelbockish
about
this
but
perhaps
that
is
what
makes
it
so
unique
prost
just
about
24
hours
or
so
until
ttu94
causes
another
international
incident
this
bock
has
a
golden
color
there
is
a
thin
head
which
is
typical
for
this
style
the
smell
is
malty
with
a
light
caramel
aroma
the
taste
is
malty
probably
from
munich
malt
then
there
is
a
caramel
taste
slightly
tanin
with
a
lightly
sweet
finish
that
seems
to
linger
the
body
is
about
medium
although
this
is
drinkable
but
at
9
6
abv
i
wouldnt
order
a
second
one
if
i
were
to
drive
after
this
d
i
dont
think
i
can
even
finish
this
bottle
this
is
getting
poured
down
the
drain
tthis
is
worse
than
my
first
batch
of
home
brew
basically
i
would
put
this
on
par
with
a
olde
english
or
crazy
horse
all
i
am
getting
here
is
alcohol
blech
stay
away
i
did
not
finish
mine
just
too
much
alcohol
taste
if
you
like
doppelbocks
this
is
a
must
a
great
brew
this
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
it
looks
more
like
a
lite
lager
than
a
doppelbock
little
head
to
speak
of
except
at
the
pour
aroma
is
pears
caramel
and
caramelized
malts
very
sweet
smelling
reminds
me
a
little
of
whiskey
taste
is
smooth
with
a
little
sharpness
at
the
end
doesnt
quite
have
the
bite
of
its
big
brother
samichlaus
very
syrupy
with
honey
and
raisin
like
taste
but
theres
not
much
else
there
a
warming
alcohol
feeling
at
the
back
end
as
well
but
not
too
strong
not
a
bad
beer
per
say
but
not
too
complex
either
certainly
doesnt
fit
the
definition
of
doppelbock
for
me
a
decent
drink
but
ill
stick
with
its
darker
and
more
filling
cousins
it
wasnt
bad
but
for
the
price
i
would
rather
buy
a
samichlaus
or
something
else
thanks
doug
pours
a
beautiful
clear
gold
with
a
smallish
white
head
smell
is
not
intense
not
skunky
but
this
beer
has
perhaps
seen
better
days
tastes
are
not
intense
some
malty
sweetness
and
a
little
hop
bitterness
some
alcohol
in
the
flavors
but
not
too
much
not
extremely
assertive
but
very
enjoyable
this
beer
might
just
as
easily
be
called
a
maibock
this
would
session
very
well
if
it
werent
for
the
9
6
abv
otherwise
it
goes
down
quite
easily
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
little
brother
of
a
sami
this
is
well
worth
keeping
a
few
in
the
closet
to
see
how
this
one
will
age
im
sure
it
will
be
great
in
a
year
or
two
light
gold
color
with
no
head
doesnt
look
too
special
aroma
is
ok
has
that
european
smell
light
carbonation
upon
tasting
you
realize
that
this
is
not
your
typical
european
lager
starts
somewhat
sweet
then
some
heat
from
the
alcohol
kicks
in
from
there
i
get
a
long
lasting
flavor
that
eventually
fades
to
a
moderate
bitterness
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
very
smooth
yum
well
done
stong
pale
doppelbock
i
usually
prefer
dunkel
bocks
but
this
beer
is
quite
good
maybe
this
was
a
golden
unicorn
batch
from
eggenber
but
my
goodness
was
it
good
i
only
wish
i
had
one
more
finally
if
this
is
a
dopplebock
i
dont
know
what
one
is
the
color
is
far
too
light
and
the
flavor
lacks
any
hint
of
roasted
grains
if
i
had
to
guess
id
say
this
was
an
eisbock
or
a
weird
alcoholic
german
lager
but
not
a
dopplebock
im
not
sorry
i
tried
it
but
this
isnt
something
im
crazy
for
d
not
as
bad
as
the
eku
28
still
id
like
to
see
you
sit
down
and
chug
a
couple
without
throwing
up
from
sheer
exhaustion
overall
a
medium
bodied
beer
on
the
verge
of
cloying
but
not
quite
rather
enjoyable
but
there
are
better
things
cheaper
out
there
i
generally
prefer
a
darker
doppelbock
not
very
complex
but
not
totally
one
dimensional
the
sweetness
is
hidng
a
couple
good
flavors
very
nice
beer
here
its
certainly
not
your
traditional
doppelbock
its
more
like
a
combination
of
a
bock
and
a
barleywine
its
very
good
though
recommended
drinkability
eggenberg
quoted
on
saying
that
on
occasion
this
beer
has
been
called
the
cognac
of
beers
is
it
that
good
i
dont
think
so
it
had
the
taste
of
alcohol
that
a
cognac
might
have
but
not
the
flavor
density
that
a
good
cognac
might
have
for
the
price
of
3
for
a
11
2
oz
bottle
one
is
more
than
enough
for
me
if
you
like
your
doppelbocks
to
be
heavy
in
alcohol
flavor
and
not
much
of
anything
else
then
pick
this
one
up
you
might
enjoy
more
than
i
did
a
surprising
beer
and
surprisingly
good
pours
a
champagnepeach
color
bright
and
bubbly
very
little
head
which
thins
out
rather
fast
even
in
dim
light
this
beer
really
shines
ive
gotten
so
used
to
dopplebocks
appearing
darker
in
color
this
is
a
real
treat
nice
malty
aroma
with
notes
of
clove
banana
and
pear
i
get
a
faint
leathery
scent
here
too
a
very
rich
but
smooth
bouquet
all
around
the
taste
is
also
rich
and
smooth
there
is
some
muted
apple
and
pear
flavor
up
front
with
a
woodflavored
maltiness
in
the
middle
finishes
almost
with
hoppedup
licorice
flavor
what
a
beer
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
and
fantastic
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
this
badboy
really
packs
a
punch
i
could
easily
drain
3
or
4
of
these
in
a
sitting
maybe
more
the
high
alcohol
is
wellmasked
by
the
complex
malts
and
spices
herein
a
treat
for
any
fan
of
the
dopplebock
i
prefer
big
beers
but
this
one
was
flawed
however
i
may
try
another
bottle
in
hopes
of
finding
something
fresher
pours
a
clear
goldencopper
color
much
paler
than
expected
for
a
dopplebock
produces
a
paperthin
off
white
head
which
fades
immediately
to
just
a
few
small
smears
of
foam
aroma
is
dominated
here
a
bit
too
strongly
by
the
alcohol
with
fainter
notes
of
ripe
pear
apple
apricot
banana
spice
and
light
malts
struggling
to
make
their
presence
known
overall
the
aroma
is
clean
and
sweet
mouthfeel
reveals
a
smooth
slightly
oily
and
sticky
texture
with
a
pleasantfine
carbonation
flavor
profile
starts
out
quite
sweet
and
fruity
with
notes
of
honey
pear
green
apple
caramel
candy
and
a
grapenut
cereal
maltiness
this
initial
sweetness
is
quickly
interupted
by
a
moderately
hot
alcohol
blast
followed
immediately
by
a
somewhat
surprising
hefty
hop
bitterness
would
have
preferred
a
slightly
sweeter
finish
on
this
one
the
hoppy
bitter
finish
seemed
a
bit
harsh
and
heavyhanded
kind
of
unusual
for
the
style
in
summary
a
decent
dopplebock
but
not
very
interesting
or
complex
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
another
one
d
not
awful
the
flavor
is
a
bit
too
sweet
to
be
drinkable
but
the
potent
hops
help
to
subside
that
problem
would
go
well
with
foods
i
dont
know
about
the
classifcation
of
this
brew
as
a
doppelbock
seems
more
like
a
maibock
to
me
overall
a
clean
lager
but
not
very
exciting
beyond
the
shocking
abv
for
such
a
pale
relatively
subdued
beer
fairly
drinkable
but
not
a
session
beer
for
me
due
to
the
abv
high
cost
and
lack
of
complex
flavors
crisp
clear
and
golden
with
a
very
small
amount
of
lacing
it
has
a
very
nice
lacing
as
well
the
smell
is
light
and
more
of
a
straight
lager
smell
than
a
doppelbock
tastes
like
a
regular
lager
too
but
with
a
big
kick
of
alcohol
it
feels
pretty
bad
on
the
palate
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
have
this
beer
again
mostly
because
it
didnt
taste
like
a
doppelbock
and
it
was
high
in
alcohol
enough
to
damage
the
taste
the
urbock
23
is
a
tasty
brew
and
its
low
carbonation
level
gives
it
a
smooth
texture
as
it
warms
i
can
say
that
the
alcohol
crept
up
on
me
rather
quickly
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
hit
quite
as
hard
as
it
did
a
clean
golden
yellow
beer
has
a
large
bubbly
white
head
a
distinct
sweet
corn
aroma
rises
from
the
glass
with
an
equally
distinct
alcohol
character
in
the
background
hints
of
malty
cereal
grain
in
the
taste
are
overpowered
the
the
strong
alcohol
presence
just
a
light
hint
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
poured
into
chalice
at
50
degrees
beer
was
a
strange
yellow
brown
with
yeast
i
guess
floating
around
beer
was
strong
tasting
of
fruit
like
a
wine
and
strong
alc
taste
good
head
at
first
i
would
inagine
if
you
liked
abbey
type
ales
tremendously
you
would
like
this
and
i
like
some
abbeys
but
this
beer
will
not
be
purchased
by
me
again
and
it
went
down
the
drain
overall
a
nice
delicious
flavorful
brew
a
dark
yellowish
and
there
are
white
fragments
floating
inside
im
not
good
at
describing
a
certain
ingredient
when
i
smell
but
i
can
tell
you
that
it
smells
comparable
to
a
belgian
tripel
style
beer
i
can
smell
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
and
the
taste
of
it
as
well
it
has
a
very
nice
taste
though
it
will
be
too
strong
for
those
you
like
a
lighter
beer
overall
an
excellent
dopplebock
i
cant
help
but
compare
this
to
samiclaus
and
i
feel
that
samiclaus
is
a
better
tasting
and
more
complex
yet
quite
similar
brew
definitely
recommended
it
tastes
much
more
like
a
dopplebock
than
it
looks
although
its
a
bit
more
of
a
brute
than
othes
of
this
style
even
so
its
still
quite
drinkable
although
the
abv
is
a
bit
prohibitive
unless
the
second
bottle
is
better
i
wont
be
buying
this
beer
again
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
but
oh
man
it
is
huge
for
the
style
there
is
something
about
a
lager
that
is
this
big
that
makes
it
so
much
more
intimidating
than
an
equal
strength
ale
you
can
really
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
one
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
be
your
first
impression
of
a
doppelbock
but
i
would
recommend
that
you
try
it
once
you
think
you
know
what
a
doppelbock
is
this
is
no
salvator
by
any
means
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
it
is
an
adventure
for
the
palate
poured
to
a
golden
color
with
hints
of
orange
nice
thick
whitish
head
thaat
reduced
to
good
lacing
aroma
was
a
mix
of
malty
sweetness
and
hoppy
fruits
taste
was
an
extension
of
this
mix
and
at
midglass
the
alcohol
become
just
noticeable
enough
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
to
fit
in
perfectly
a
long
smooth
tasty
finish
topped
the
whole
thing
off
this
was
really
a
good
beer
and
i
will
no
doubt
have
more
urbock
23
pale
golden
amber
with
a
low
head
of
moderate
density
gone
before
you
let
your
breath
out
smells
deeply
rich
and
malty
throw
in
some
freshly
mown
grass
and
orange
peel
and
youve
got
it
down
tastes
hugely
overpowering
something
raisiny
alcohol
and
sweet
malts
maybe
a
touch
of
lighter
caramel
in
that
coupled
with
the
very
thick
mouth
this
is
so
thick
in
your
mouth
in
sweetness
and
malts
that
i
just
cant
finish
my
glass
its
like
a
beer
that
youd
serve
with
dessert
and
each
guest
would
get
a
2
oz
glass
of
it
its
that
strong
in
flavor
i
dont
know
that
its
really
a
bad
beer
but
its
sure
hard
to
drink
more
than
2
oz
a
very
strong
alcohol
smell
and
taste
overpowered
the
other
flavors
and
made
this
rather
unenjoyable
the
appearance
was
beautiful
with
a
rich
golden
color
and
steady
stream
of
carbonation
i
am
pleased
about
the
schloeggenberg
lettering
on
the
bottle
i
will
have
to
revisit
this
beer
but
right
now
i
just
dont
appreciate
it
drinkability
is
high
as
is
the
abv
prosit
und
zum
wohl
mk
d
it
was
nice
to
try
this
beer
and
i
would
discourage
anyone
from
it
gor
me
it
was
nothing
special
poured
into
a
snifter
w
little
to
no
head
it
looks
like
a
high
gravity
beer
as
it
leaves
an
alcohol
trail
around
the
glass
as
it
is
swirled
the
aroma
is
hot
w
alcohol
fumes
there
is
whiff
of
figs
and
leather
the
taste
is
hot
alcohol
that
warms
as
it
goes
down
the
sweet
malt
is
the
showcase
very
full
bodied
the
heat
and
the
sweet
coating
of
sugars
are
a
little
much
this
is
a
brew
to
be
enjoyed
once
in
a
while
but
not
everyday
drinkability
i
hesitated
when
pulling
this
brew
out
during
a
90
degree
plus
day
do
i
really
want
a
thick
and
dark
doppelbock
well
turns
out
it
was
light
colored
and
pretty
refreshing
the
price
was
a
bit
steep
but
would
have
again
if
found
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
due
to
the
high
abv
and
the
fact
that
it
is
pretty
noticeable
a
strong
beer
with
not
much
aroma
or
beauty
but
a
nice
wellblended
taste
bottle
courtesy
of
hogtownharry
poured
a
clear
golden
color
beer
with
small
bubbly
head
that
disappeared
quite
quickly
aroma
is
extremely
sweet
with
some
weird
grainy
aroma
taste
is
just
incredibly
sweet
with
a
warming
touch
of
alcohol
i
couldnt
honestly
pickup
much
more
then
sweetness
in
this
and
therefore
i
probably
wont
be
revisiting
this
onedimensional
beer
anytime
soon
pours
a
honeygold
with
a
white
fluffy
head
quickly
dissipating
all
too
quick
but
to
be
expected
at
this
abv
level
smells
of
sweet
malts
a
sugary
caramel
notes
of
brandy
surprisingly
thin
thouht
certainly
sweet
malts
crisp
finish
light
hops
again
somewhat
watery
for
this
highpriced
brew
excellent
mouthfeel
drinkable
but
the
abv
prevents
me
from
trying
another
tonight
i
look
forward
to
the
next
opportunity
to
try
this
again
overall
an
interesting
beer
close
to
an
icebock
the
style
says
dopplebock
but
the
color
looks
more
like
a
fine
maibock
gold
and
very
clear
topped
by
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
nice
dopple
character
rich
and
malty
with
layers
of
caramel
roast
caramel
a
bright
finish
from
hops
the
taste
is
dead
center
between
very
thick
and
rich
caramel
flavor
even
some
chocolate
character
very
sweet
with
a
finish
of
orange
citrus
maybe
a
little
medicinal
on
my
2nd
drink
too
bad
a
bit
of
alcohol
flavor
although
no
real
heat
thick
and
smooth
mouth
feel
decent
drinkability
not
the
same
beer
its
big
brother
is
samiclaus
but
then
its
nut
supposed
to
be
pours
a
clear
golden
slightly
redorange
in
a
bowl
chalice
with
only
a
small
capper
of
offwhite
head
retention
and
lacing
is
minimal
almost
no
bubbles
rising
through
the
liquid
aroma
is
surprisingly
belgianlike
but
only
somewhat
sweet
lightly
spicy
and
vinous
with
a
strong
vinous
aroma
first
drink
is
sweet
with
strong
alcohol
and
a
yeasty
light
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
sip
theres
a
peppery
spicyness
that
lingers
from
the
middle
of
the
sip
through
the
aftertaste
finish
is
quite
dry
alcohol
dominates
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
body
with
a
light
carbonation
that
combines
with
a
significant
alcohol
burn
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
nice
alcohol
warming
overall
i
must
say
im
a
little
disappointed
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
a
decent
slow
sipper
but
a
little
too
simplistic
and
for
some
reason
it
reminds
me
of
just
an
average
belgian
strong
pale
ale
the
body
is
actually
quite
light
for
such
a
high
abv
syrupy
sweet
beer
also
fairly
drinkable
for
that
matter
probably
not
something

high
alcohol
in

with
a

also
eggshells

in

it
drinkable

comparable
to
my
having
vodka
with
my
beer
medium
mouthfeel
grainy
malty

the
head
is
a

fading
wispy
white
affair
honey
laden
with
bready
malts
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
and
sticky
but
the
overall
feel
is
a
fortifying
honey
sweet
malt
bomb
that
gets
you
warm
and
happy
feeling
this
one
tends
to
draw
you
in
a
bit
sort
of
like
a
comfort
beer
d
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
doppelbocks

i
found
this
to
be

is
the
most
undoppelbocklike
doppelbock
that
ive
ever
had
it
lacks
the
best
characteristics
of
the
style
or
at
least
the
ones
i
like
the
most
and
puts
nothing
of
value
in
their
place
if
youre
an
aficionado
of
highabv
maibocks
and
have
been
looking
for
a
year
round
version
saddle
up
and
ride
as
for
me
this
is
my
first
and
last
bottle
coming
in
a
brown
330
ml
bottle
with
attractive
gold
on
black
labeling
i
was
expecting
a
beer
looking
like
an
original
bock
instead
the
beer
poured
out
pale
golden
and
clear
like
a
modern
lager
the
head
was
rather
small
in
size
as
can
be
expected
at
this
strength
the
beer
exhibited
a
grainy
and
floral
bouquet
which
was
a
little
too
clean
the
alcohol
was
also
evident
in
the
nose
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
the
taste
was
not
very
bock
like
but
closer
to
a
light
bodied
sweet
lager
with
spices
like
pepper
and
vanilla
resembling
quite
a
lot
of
strong
pale
ales
from
belgian
abbeys
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
was
present
as
a
potent
reminder
of
the
careful
sipping
this
beer
demanded
the
yeast
imparted
a
dusty
dryness
and
an
earthy
bitterness
both
of
which
are
rather
uncommon
is
a
german
style
lager
as
i
got
deeper
into
the
glass
the
beer
seemed
to
become
sweeter
and
perfumey
the
beer
was
not
too
thick
on
the
palette
but
had
enough
malt
body
to
keep
it
from
being
too
adjuncty
not
too
traditional
but
enjoyable
enough
to
try
if
you
havent
i
work
for
an
austrian
company
and
got
my
urbocks
shipped
direct
from
the
mother
country
pours
with
a
good
golden
color
alcohol
nose
was
strong
very
thin
head
that
dissipated
through
the
drinking
of
it
a
few
citrus
notes
with
a
very
strong
mouthfeel
i
enjoy
a
good
alcohol
presence
and
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
a
classic
its
interesting
but
not
really
complex
and
the
alcohol
tends
to
hinder
its
drinkability
quite
a
bit
its
nice
but
there
are
more
flavorful
and
balanced
helles
doppelbocks
available
drinkability
good
the
complexity
in
both
smell
and
taste
is
good
and
for
the
most
part
so
is
the
balance
the
alcohol
is
a
little
overpowering
in
the
taste
however
the
only
reason
i
didnt
rate
this
beer
higher
is
because
while
i
truly
enjoy
it
it
doesnt
seem
to
follow
the
style
as
i
said
this
looks
and
tastes
like
a
belgian
tripel
not
an
austrian
doppelbock
11
2
ounce
bottle
no
freshness
dating
lightest
dopplebock
i
have
ever
encountered
more
the
color
of
a
spring
bock
but
definitely
packs
a
powerful
punch
its
full
bodied
and
syrupy
and
though
it
weighs
in
at
9
6
alcohol
it
actually
seems
stronger
nightcap
material
and
nice
but
a
bit
scattered
impression
deceivingly
alcoholic
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
alcohol
clean
flavor
pleasant
and
complex
well
aged
impressively
mild
good
beer
but
not
what
i
expected
from
a
dopplebock
urbocks
color
is
golden
brown
with
a
small
creamy
head
carbonation
is
pretty
good
the
aroma
has
a
dark
fruity
malt
smell
more
like
an
eisbock
than
the
dopples
ive
had
the
taste
continues
with
a
dark
fruit
flavor
almost
plumlike
with
a
little
alcohol
bite
the
alcoholic
taste
is
most
notable
in
the
finish
this
seems
more
like
a
slightly
weak
eisbock
than
your
average
dopplebock
the
taste
is
very
good
but
still
doesnt
seem
as
fullflavored
as
it
could
be
there
are
better
dopples
and
eisbocks
and
this
beer
just
sits
on
the
line
between
the
two
styles
pours
a
clear
amber
very
light
for
its
strength
white
head
dissipates
very
quickly
with
not
much
lacing
so
far
smells
like
malt
and
alcohol
not
very
complex
tastes
like
alcohol
as
well
sweet
malt
is
present
its
actually
quite
balanced
for
such
a
big
beer
maybe
so
balanced
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
of
flavour
involved
mouthfeel
is
pretty
full
no
doubt
from
all
the
malt
kind
of
nail
polishy
flavour
as
well
pretty
smooth
though
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
again
though
i
recognize
it
was
one
of
the
strongest
beers
in
the
world
back
in
the
day
but
nowadays
it
just
doesnt
live
up
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
strong
pale
malt
scent
that
is
warm
and
sweet
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
thick
and
rich
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
sweet
and
warm
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
any
real
complexity
here
but
the
taste
is
good
nonetheless
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
brew
it
has
good
flavor
and
a
decent
aroma
a
good
drinker
for
a
dopplebock
this
stuff
is
very
light
a
clear
medium
gold
color
with
barely
any
head
beyond
a
wis
of
bubbles
alcohol
is
present
in
the
nose
as
well
as
raisin
and
lots
of
malt
taste
is
pretty
good
alcohol
provides
a
nice
backdrop
for
the
inherent
maltiness
of
this
beer
not
overly
sweet
with
some
grassiness
to
boot
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
well
enough
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
even
though
its
a
weird
looking
dopplebock
this
beer
pours
a
very
clear
brilliant
golden
color
with
a
very
active
bubble
and
no
head
the
nose
is
super
strong
big
dark
fruits
and
a
blast
of
alcohol
kick
me
in
the
face
the
flavor
is
very
full
sweetness
with
an
almost
oakeywoody
character
the
feel
is
thick
and
rather
syrupy
but
with
a
huge
drying
effect
on
the
middle
sides
of
my
tongue
feeling
almost
like
something
is
pinching
in
there
overall
im
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
one
its
not
bad
but
surely
not
at
all
what
i
really
like
smell
was
strong
but
very
tasty
for
a
high
content
beer
syrupy
and
almost
sweet
no
hard
kick
which
surprised
me
a
surprisingly
smooth
beer
pours
a
bright
clear
golden
color
with
not
much
head
to
speak
of
seems
to
be
fairly
highly
carbonated

such
a
high

a
wonderful
nightcap
sipping
beer
from
an
early
disorienting
start
due
to
the
color
and
the
limited
nose
this
beer
recovers
nicely
perhaps
it
is
more
indicative
of
an
austrian
doppelbock
style

i
am

the
variation

alcohol
is
a

strong
side

otherwise
a
nice
beer

into

and
a
touch
of
yeast

alcohol
is
noticable
in
the
nose
and
imparts
a
dry
finish
to
the
beer
mostly
candily
malty
sweet
with
some
vinous
slightly
vegetal
characteristics
pretty
good
with
the
understanding
that
it
is
a
slowsipper
due
to
the
noticable
presence
of
warming
alcohol
nice
on
a
cool
evening
as
a
digestif
the
one
thing
i
love
about
being
back
in
the
us
is
the
massive
variety
of
beer
that
is
available
to
us
sometimes
i
think
that
we
forget
about
that
i
picked
up
this
nice
looking
bottle
about
2
miles
away
from
my
apartment
ive
never
had
anything
from
castle
eggenberg
before
but
something
was
telling
me
to
grab
this
instead
of
the
samilchlaus
sitting
right
alongside
of
it
it
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
head
that
sticks
around
for
about
10
seconds
before
retreating
to
the
walls
of
the
glass
not
too
impressive
smell
consists
of
very
sweet
malts
and
faint
faint
notes
of
alcohol
taste
is
a
malt
lovers
paradise
very
sweet
toffeeish
malts
lead
into
traces
of
alcohol
on
the
tongue
it
definately
warms
as
it
is
going
down
a
dry
alcohol
taste
remains
on
the
tongue
for
several
minutes
after
swallowing
this
would
be
a
perfect
beer
for
crisp
october
nights
and
i
think
i
will
be
saving
my
next
bottle
for
exactly
one
of
those
evenings
pours
out
an
orangey
yellow
into
my
glass
no
head
at
all
smell
is
malty
sweet
caramel
overtones
and
candy
sugar
plenty
of
alcohol
presence
in
there
as
well
slightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
quite
pleasant
for
a
malt
head
like
me
not
as
sweet
as
the
more
potent
samichlaus
a
tasty
treat
that
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
of
i
think
that
the
style
is
wrong
for
this
beer
urbock
is
very
different
from
every
doppelbock
i
have
ever
had
clear
orange
gold
color
with
a
frothy
head
that
subsided
quickly
atop
a
beer
with
very
little
carbonation
the
flavors
of
this
beer
were
primarily
in
the
domain
of
hops
and
not
malt
as
the
flavor
began
with
a
sharp
german
hop
bitterness
followed
by
a
sweet
light
malt
and
high
alcohol
followed
by
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
i
do
not
believe
munich
malt
came
anywhere
near
this
doppelbock
as
the
malt
flavors
are
smooth
and
the
color
is
so
light
a
pretty
good
beer
with
no
faults
but
it
is
a
very
poor
example
of
a
doppelbock
almost
no
head
on
a
transparent
orange
yellow
color
body
the
beer
looks
dead
the
smell
doesnt
show
much
a
bit
disappoiting
the
taste
is
fruity
but
the
alcohol
flavor
invades
the
whole
palate
and
gives
a
real
kick
in
the
mouth
very
liquorish
as
if
this
beer
was
made
just
to
show
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
quite
warming
in
the
throat
there
are
some
stronger
beers
that
are
really
much
more
refined
than
that
nice
deep
gold
with
a
two
finger
head
that
quickly
falls
leaving
a
lacy
surface
foam
falls
from
the
high
alcohol
i
presume
malty
sweet
in
the
nose
high
alcohol
like
a
barley
whine
wo
hops
taste
is
very
sweet
it
is
strong
but
lacks
the
balance
of
bitterness
cloying
at
times
seems
smooth
and
might
be
a
good
after
dinner
drink
the
body
is
perfect
its
smooth
and
buttery
it
really
fills
up
the
tongue
it
goes
down
very
easy
this
beer
poured
a
clear
yellow
color
and
formed
a
small
bubby
white
head
that
left
little
lace
as
it
quickly
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
pine
and
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
malt
a
touch
of
hops
and
a
heavy
hint
of
alcohol
the
finish
was
medium
light
yet
creamy
it
was
a
touch
astrigent
with
the
alcohol
coming
across
on
the
palate
a
good
beer
but
hard
for
me
to
think
of
as
a
dopplebock
like
celebrator
i
will
try
to
rerate
this
with
a
better
bottle
in
the
future
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
it
wont
fit
into
the
regular
rotation
clear
golden
body
with
a
rather
light
quickly
fading
head
sweet
honeyish
malty
aroma
with
a
mild
kick

lavor
starts
out
with
sweet
biscuity
malts
a
nice
balancing
of
hops
becomes
present
finishs
a
little
sherrylike
with
a
nice
warming
sensation
body
was
as
expected
for
its
heft
rich
i
enjoyed
this
beer
for
being
sweet
without
being
cloying
which
is
what
i
was
wrongly
expecting
nice
beer
this
is
an
experience
beer
good
from
time
to
time
it
is
quite
enjoyable
drink
this
on
a
day
when
you
are
only
going
to
have
one
overall
enjoyable

like
a
bigass

is

dominated
by
a

backbone
several
dark

around
to
keep

interesting

with
a
caramel
aftertaste
that
is
immediately
followed
by
a
biiter
herbal
hoppiness
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
complex
brew
that
is
a
departure
from
bavarian

and
bitter
yeasty
and
spicy
like

this

be
taken
for

very
tingly
from

leafy

not
a
bad
beer
a
very
interesting
surprise
from
austria
this
is
not
near
as
good
as
the
samichlaus
but
passable
drinkability

this
went
down
like
courtney
love
at
a
rock
concert
i
cant
say
that
it
even
remotely
resembled
the
doppelbock
style
but
it
was
awesome
nevertheless
i
will
rate
it
on
its
merits
other
im
really
changing
my
mind
about
lagers
when
all
youve
really
been
exposed
to
is
the
pale
lager
variety
can
you
blame
me
light
amber
colored
beer
it
actually
looks
something
like
a
piece
of
clear
amber
jewelry
intense
carbonation
but
a
relatively
thin
largebubbled
head
an
almost
monstrous

aside

with
a
very
mild
hopiness
peppery
spicy
smell
and
taste
the
beer
is
intensely
sweet
and
has
a
harsh
alcohol
finish
full
bodied
sometimes
creamy
mouthfeel
the
more
that
i
drank
of
this
beer
the
more
it
became
onedimensional
sticky
sweetness

intense

not
particularly
drinkable
clear
gold
hue
oodles
of
animation
endless
streams
of
bubbles
race
towards
the
white
head
absolutely
gorgeous
the
head
collapsed
at
a
modest
pace
the
tight
cap
held
well
no
lace
the
nose
is
tartly
sweet
but
a
harder
sniff
draws
out
clean
hearty
maltiness
a
note
of
alcohol
too
while
it
is
not
all
that
potent
it
is
inviting
warming
spicy
alcohol

distant
maltiness

all
construct
the
marvelous
palate
sweet
at
times
more
peppery
at
others
borderline
cloying
but
the
hot
alcohol
cuts
off
that
notion
quickly
wow
this
is
not
a
typical
dopplebock
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
it
is
like
a
belgiuminfluenced
dopplebock
weird
yes
but
very
tasty
complex
and
intriguing
light
in
body
not
thin
however
the
carbonation
is
little
this
is
a
wonderful
sipping
beer
savor
this
one
seek
it
out
highly
recommended
deep
clear

a
decent

doesnt

sweet
malty

full

and
a
thick
and
syrupy
mouthfeel
alcohol
comes
out
in
the
finish
with
a
sticky
sweetness
not
at
all
what
i
expected
poured
a
softly
bronzed
orange
color
with
a
small
foam
head
that
sat
pretty
well
leaving
behind
some
tendrils
of
stain
smell
was
round
and
subtle
with
orange
notes
that
open
to
the
most
true
scent
of
citrus
rinds
ive
seen
in
a
lager
malt
body
though
with
alcohol
scents
of
a
small
and
acceptable
size
and
quality
taste
was
lightly
creamy
with
notes
of
lemon
orange
and
grapefruit
like
a
fruit
cocktail
of
these
they
mergecreate
a
very
moderate
and
calm
bitterness
balancing
with
the
very
fine
malt
in
the
background
a
malt
that
was
not
great
or
characterful
but
there
finish
was
moderate
tasting
like
a
mishmashed
blend
of
the
palette
while
it
does
becomes
grassy
and
a
bit
oily
had
some
whiskey
malt
notes
that
only
come
out
toward
the
end
of
the
finish
smooth
full
and
silent
mouthfeel
so
good
you
dont
notice
because
it
fits
the
overall
character
of
the
beer
perfectly
intensely
drinkable
goes
down
so
easy
if
this
was
cheap
and
more
available
there
would
be
trouble
this
beer
wowed
some
friends
who
arent
big
into
beer
pours
clear
and
just
a
fraction
darker
than
pure
gold
the
head
was
thin
fizzy
and
very
shortlived
the
aroma
is
marvelous
candied
fruits
malt
and
yes
cognac
the
mouth
is
prickly
but
also
heavy
with
sweet
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
sweet
and
fruity
yet
the
alcohol
makes
its
presence
known
the
hops
lurk
in
the
background
at
first
then
come
out
as
the
sweetness
fades
and
the
alcohol
attempts
to
take
over
the
battle
is
finally
won
by
the
warm
soothing
sweet
alcohol
with
the
raisin
and
apple
tones
definitely
a
winter
warmer
this
goes
down
well
in
moscow
in
early
september
im
enjoying
this
but
like
its
adopted
brother
samichlaus
this
is
not
the
beer
to
have
when
you
are
having
more
than
one
another
good
beer
from
eggenberg
im
looking
forward
to
the
samichlaus
again
this
winter
but
for
now
this
has
to
be
my
favorite
id
definitely
have
another
one
of
these
pours
a
sound
gold
tone
with
a
nice
sized
creamy
white
head
very
solid
looking
brew
but
i
was
anticipating
a
ruby
tint
to
it
for
some
reason
trickles
of
small
spots
of
scattered
lacing
not
bad
decent
overall
but
this
golden
appearance
is
just
a
front
for
this
beer
packs
quite
a
punch
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
for
starters
deep
syrupy
sweet
tones
surround
the
nose
with
jet
streams
of
alcohol
wavering
in
the
air
definite
fruit
soaked
in
alcohol
slightly
caramelized
reminds
me
of
some
moonshine
i
once
tried
from
kentucky
in
the
aroma
with
a
splash
of
honey
to
it
this
ones
complex
and
appetising
start
with
small
sips
this
one
needs
some
adjusting
to
just
like
toeing
your
way
into
a
cold
pool
but
once
you
just
dive
in
its
all
worth
it
flavor
consists
of
one
malty
backbone
with
pan
seared
over
ripened
fruits
drizzled
in
honey
and
a
touch
of
banana
flavored
rum
sprinkled
to
kick
it
up
a
notch
wow
this
is
great
as
alcohol
sears
the
back
of
the
throat
doesnt
scorch
enough
to
cause
discomfort
just
lets
you
know
the
alcohols
in
there
some
beers
the
taste
of
alcohol
being
apparent
detracts
from
teh
overall
taste
in
this
particular
brew
it
only
enhances
the
experience
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
sticky
chewy
texture
very
nice
the
final
chapter
in
this
beer
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
is
wield
the
power
wisely
becareful
with
this
one
at
9
6
it
warms
you
up
dont
make
it
a
challenge
to
indulge
but
enjoy
this
one
a
quite
enjoyable
slow
sipper
that
qualifies
on
my
list
of
winter
warmers
to
keep
in
mind
this
winter
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
almost
no
head
and
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mostly
fruit
and
alcohol
mostly
alcohol
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
a
wine
with
an
oak
character
very
thick
sweet
maltiness
and
alcohol
are
the
first
things
noticed
in
the
flavor
drinkability
suffers
from
the
alcohol
not
one
of
my
favorites
poured
a
amberbronze
much
lighter
in
color
than
i
expected
for
a
doppelbock
flavor
is
dominated
by
a
bittersweet
syrupy
malt
that
coats
the
tongue
alcohol
is
quite
evident
in
the
flavor
profile
adding
a
pepper
that
tries
to
cut
through
the
blanket
of
sweetness
but
fails
to
make
a
substantial
dent
heavy
and
unwieldy
a
delightfully
creamy
and
sweet
beer
reminds
me
of
a
sauternes
wine
or
perhaps
a
tokay
marvelous
fruity
alcoholic
aftertaste
like
a
mediumbodied
semisweet
wine
the
low
drinkability
lowers
what
would
be
a
reasonably
good
beverage
if
i
didnt
know
better
id
think
i
was
drinking
malt
liquor
potent
stuff
campers
not
a
good
beer
in
my
opinion
the
barley
taste
is
just
too
much
for
me
the
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
yellow
the
head
modest
in
size
frothy
in
texture
off
white
in
color
and
it
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
silky
sheet
of
lace
to
caress
the
glass
a
touch
of
yeast
lots
of
malt
fresh
and
clean
is
the
nose
big
malt
start
that
is
also
sweet
the
top
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
delectable
in
the
hop
arena
the
carbonation
purposeful
the
aftertaste
droughty
and
a
fine
beer
to
be
sure
and
well
worth
a
sample
475
any
head
this
beer
had
went
away
very
soon
after
i
finished
pouring
the
liquid
itself
was
beautiful
it
was
a
perfect
golden
color
with
not
a
bit
of
haze
or
anything
to
make
it
look
less
than
regal
malty
bock
aroma
but
with
a
good
sized
dose
of
spicy
hops
which
were
quite
a
surprise
caramel
and
malt
flavors
were
tasted
without
surprise
and
the
beer
was
very
warming
on
the
way
down
the
only
thing
i
didnt
like
was
a
very
shortlived
fusel
alcohol
taste
after
each
sip
it
was
quite
a
distraction
it
was
kind
of
medicinal
and
very
unpleasant
ill
have
to
try
this
beer
again
to
make
sure
i
didnt
get
a
bad
one
crystal
clear
and
golden
in
color
with
very
little
carbonation
and
no
head
at
all
the
aroma
is
sugary
sweet
with
a
bit
of
raisiny
fruitiness
the
flavor
too
starts
off
quite
sugary
almost
granular
big
malt
body
with
more
fruit
notes
and
noticeable
alcohol
warming
hops
are
purely
supportive
but
contribute
to
a
dryish
finish
mediumbodiedcreamy
and
somewhat
coating
but
not
excessively
so
decent
beer
but
a
bit
onedimensional
in
terms
of
flavor
slightly
hazy
cinnamon
orangebrown
lighter
than
i
expected
small
head
that
doesnt
last
more
than
30
seconds
very
simple
lacing
on
the
glass
deep
buttery
toffee
flavors
similar
to
cracker
jacks
caramel
medium
bodied
a
little
sense
of
coating
but
not
like
a
samichlaus
slight
sense
of
peach
and
a
prickly
bit
of
noticeable
hops
alcohol
acts
as
a
counterbalance
to
the
sweetness
comes
on
midmouth
and
in
the
aftertaste
interesting
starts
subtle
and
sweet
and
gains
body
toward
the
end
a
few
bottles
are
left
at
the
liquor
store
and
theyre
coming
home
with
me
for
those
special
friggin
freezing
minnesota
evenings
crystal
clear
golden
in
hue
topped
by
head
that
readily
dissipates
into
a
glass
coating
ring
most
closely
resembles
a
hellebock
in
appearance
the
aroma
is
a
combination
of
nutty
toasty
munich
malt
and
buttery
toffee
w
a
hint
of
a
floral
mittelfruh
hop
nose
oddly
as
the
brew
warms
and
breathes
there
is
no
change
in
the
aroma
at
all
completely
static
aromawise
sugary
sweetness
hits
the
palate
initially
then
yields
to
a
malt
profile
comprised
of
honey
drenched
toasty
grain
an
unexpected
snap
of
moderate
hop
bitterness
emerges
mid
palate
immediately
offsetting
and
almost
sharply
contrasting
the
previously
sweet
malt
profile
deceivingly
light
in
body
w
an
agreeable
and
slightly
slick
mouthfeel
finishes
w
a
resurgence
of
sweetness
lingering
lending
an
overall
sweet
impression

this
brew

warmth
creeps
in
slowly
and

long
deliberation
urbock
23
is
truly
a
unique
and
enjoyable
beer
a
doppelhellesbock
strong
slightly
floral
and
slightly
sweet
aroma
kind
of
sticky
sweet
start
which
quickly
fades
to
a
dryish
bitter
finish
very
warming
brew
also
a
bit
of
a
whiskeyish
character
lots
of
body
and
flavour
i
liked
this
stuff
first
thing
i
picked
up
on
the
nose
is
lemons
a
little
spicy
yeast
and
a
sweet
smell
the
color
is
clear
but
lackluster
it
seemed
dull
not
a
lot
of
head
and
and
very
little
retention
flavor
mildly
malty
the
tiniest
bit
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
good
dose
of
alcohol
seemed
a
little
thin
i
am
surprised
this
has
been
hosed
by
many
other
reviews
it
has
me
grinning
like
cheshire
cat
interesting
is
rightpours
a
crystal
clear
shiny
gold
color
i
could
smell
the
alcohol
aroma
a
bit
as
well
as
malts
on
the
palate
there
is
tiny
alcohol
bite
but
really
comes
of
spicy
or
peppery
but
this
brew
sure
does
give
a
warming
sensation
all
the
way
throughquite
interesting
for
a
dbin
the
finish
venom
nailed
it
tastes
like
whisky
a
bitoverall
very
interesting
dbthe
extreme
warming
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
is
awesome
anyhoo
urbock
23
has
the
basic
aroma
and
flavor
of
a
doppel
it
has
a
nice
sweet
and
malty
nose
with
a
bit
of
spice
i
saw
vanilla
listed
on
another
review
but
im
not
sure
thats
what
i
picked
up
to
it
the
flavor
is
rich
with
molasseslike
flavors
and
a
bit
of
balancing
hops
this
is
one
of
those
brews
that
had
an
obvious
alcohol
presence
in
its
warmth
in
the
mouthfeel
and
continues
to
warm
as
i
drank
however
i
didnt
notice
any
alcohol
in
the
aroma
or
taste
i
thought
that
was
a
bit
odd
but
certainly
not
unpleasant
clear
golden
color
a
bit
of
skunk
on
the
nose
a
bit
of
an
off
flavor
slightly
skunky
tastes
a
bit
like
many
european
beers
that
ive
had
in
bottles
has
that
european
skunk
to
me
not
very
good
im
surprised
a
bit
because
i
really
enjoyed
their

alcohol
youd
never
guess
it
sweet

with
little
hopping
a
bit
sweet
for
some
but
a
good
blond
doppel
in
my
book
a
nice
flowery
hop
profile
would
do
wonders
for
this
beer
could
use
some
additional
hopping
but
still
very
good
as
is
very
thin
too
much

pretty
gross

poured
from

a
dark

beer
with
a
shapely
offwhite
head
with
an
aroma
of
light
toffee
dried
dark
fruit
sweet
wet
grains
and
some
mellow
spice
notes
the
overall
aroma
is
homogenized
with
the
elements
merging
together
this
smells
like
the
platonic
ideal
of
a
bock
beer
a
classic
brown
lager
the
palate
is
similarly
wellintegrated
with
no
sharp
corners
or
overtly
bold
flavors
no
one
component
tries
to
trump
any
other
but
theres
complexity
nonetheless
quite
crisp
and
dry
for
a
doppelbock
with
moderate
carbonation
and
body
on
the
thin
side
tastes
like
brown
bread
nutty
yeast
molasses
light
rum
earthy
ginseng
spice
and
sweet
dough
with
assertive
hopping
for
the
style
finishes
quite
crisp
and
clean
with
some
lingering
noble
hop
spice
and
grass
notes
certainly
wellcrafted

perhaps
i
was
expecting
more

a

a

things

the

solid

this
robust

smooth

anyway
overall
this
is
an
interesting
brew
i
need
to
do
the
sami
now
to
see
if
it
is
the
brewery
which
produces
this
peculiar
taste
or
if
it
is
the
ingredients
or
the
region
i
want
to
say
i
like
it
its
certainly
a
heavier
doblebock
than
the
typical
german
variety
and
very
sweet
still
i
give
it
a
4
5
overall
simply
for
the
memories
but
it
rightfully
deserves
it
bottle
was

2
oz
overall
complex

flavour
for
an
easy
drinking
brew
balances
everything
perfectly
from
sweet
to
bitter
crisp
and
smooth
complex
and
familiar
o
a
nice
doppelbock
but
not
quite
up
there
with
the
most
complex
bavarian
ones
i
had
high
expectations
on
this
doppelbock
from
the
brewery
of
samichlaus
but
yet
again
the
complexity
is
not
what
i
hoped
for
rather
than
expected
over
my
go
to
bach
o
with
the
flavour
on
the
lighter
side
how
did
they
manage
to
hide
the
alcohol
its
quite
easy
to
drink
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
ok
flavors
and
aromas
o
decent
doppelbock
but
not
my
favourite
i
wouldnt
seek
out
another
bottle
and
im
hesitant
to
say
i
would
even
suggest
that
someone
try
it
if
youre
in
dire
need
of
a
doppelbock
and
this
is
available
it
would
satisfy
your
craving
but
dont
expect
anything
special
o
nice
and
easy
drinking

receding

doesnt

difficult
to
pick
out
from
behind
its
powerful

tastes
malty
and
sweet
upfront
with
bread
and
brown
sugar
flavours
before
a
note
of
watered
down
cocacola
comes
through
midway
finishes
a
little
boozy
with
some
light
bitterness
just
shy
of
mediumbodied
with
low
carbonation
lightly
syrupy
lacks
weight
this
is
an
enjoyable
enough
beer
but
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
celebrator
salvator
weltenburger
or
optimator
though
i
tend
to
like
my
doppels
to
be
malty
monsters
i
do
enjoy
this
lighter
take
on
the
style
all
the
flavors
are
there
but
it
aint
quite
so
heavy
as
some
of
the
others
affordable
too
might
pick
up
a
few
more

the

season

with
some

and
a
thick
sticky
collar
persists
lager
yeast
and

notes
are
there
with
some
toasty
bread
and

right
alongside
not
too
sweet
but
a

on
the
drier
side
a
bit
of

and

and
slightly

through
as
anticipated
gets
sweeter
as
it
warms
lightly
fruity
and
gentle
toasty
malt
notes
not
a
ton
of
complexity
but
straightforward
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
sweetness
and
alcohol
wash
over
this
mediumheavy
feel
and
drinkable
a
nice
affordable
doppelbock
i
could
seek
this
out
again
overall
the
best
part
of
the
beer
is
probably
how
well
it
hides
its
alcohol
the
taste
is
decent
but
nothing
that
will
wow
you
also
the
mouth
feel
leave
a
lot
to
be
desired
i
wouldnt
pick
this
one
up
again
but
it
was
worth
a
try
m
thin
to
medium
bodied

carbonation

a
slight

some

some

in

dark

and
some

in

sticky
feel
especially
in
the
back
of
the
throat
that
took
some
getting
used
to
medium
carbonation
syrupy
and
full
bodied
not
bad
but
easily
forgetable
worth
a
shot
but
there
are
better
examples
out
there
medium
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
bitter
on
the
back
end
with
the
booze
lingering
in
the
finish
definitely
drinkable
although
my
constitution
would
be
tested
putting
back
a
six
pack
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
reminiscent
of
brown
ales
it
is
good
with
a
meal
or
as
an
appetizer
and
if
the
alcohol
were
lower
it
might
even
make
for
a
fine
session
beer
md
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
fizzy
and
refreshing
especially
when
taking
into
account
the
8
5abv
its
good
that
the
beer
never
tastes
too
sweet
as
the
hop
bitterness
does
render
a
considerable
balancing
influence
and
the
sourness
typical
of
a
welllagered
bock
beer
also
makes
itself
felt
well
enough
not
as
good
as
the
same
brewerys
other
doppelbock
imo
perhaps
due
to
the
less
depth
from
the
malts
used
but
still
an
easydrinking
heavy
beer
quite
interesting
although
im
not
sure
of
the
age
on
this
one
i
can
tell
based
on
the
oxidation
flavors
present
that
its
probably
been
at
least
a
couple
of
years
since
it
was
bottled
it
is
aging
quite
well
so
i
give
it
points
for
that
underneath
the
oxidation
character
there
are
remnants
of
a
good
doppelbock
and
i
can
see
this
being
a
much
maltier
robust
beer
in
its
younger
days
good
but
there
are
certainly
better
doppelbocks
out
there
still
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
overall
impression
a
nice
doppelbock
but
where
is
the
body
wish
it
had
more
depth
and
ingredient
here
i
really
enjoyed
the
toffee
flavors
in
it
though
would
definitely
recommend
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
this
was
very
tasty
im
surprised
it
hasnt
scored
higher
poured
a
2
beige
head
with
reasonable
length
clear
dark
burnt
umber
brown
color
smells
not
only
of
malt
but
fresh
bread
and
that
carries
through
nicely
into
the
taste
body
is
lighter
than
the
smell
and
taste
would
lead
me
to
expect
and
it
cost
me
under
5
which
to
me
is
pretty
good
for
this
quality
of
import
nice
overall
solid
very
quaffable
brew
o
big
in
flavour
and
feel
with
the
alcohol
very
well
disguised
maybe
a
little
over
the
top
on
sweetness
but
still
a
fine
example
of
the
style
i
really
like
this
doppelbock
its
just
pungent
enough
to
be
a
sipper
but
not
so
much
that
it
loses
any
of
its
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
and
one
that
i
strongly
recommend
this
bottle
is
not
the
best
of
shape
as
lover
of
dopplebocks
i
will
have
to
try
this
on
tap
some
time
underneath
the
smell
of
oxidised
cardboard
there
once
was
a
nice
beer
chocolate
malt
with
nutty
toffee
coffee
backbone
to
this
beer
but
as
stated
before
the
beer
is
not
of
the
best
of
shape
o
hopefully
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
and
i
could
not
particularly
tell
but
there
are
much
better
doppelbocks
that
exist
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
the
components
work
well
together
and
i
think
the
rate
limiting
step
is
the
alcohol
notes
that
seem
to
build
this
would
be
a
great
beer
in
autumn
above
average
double
bock
that
falls
short
of
the
top
tier
but
should
definitely
be
tried
if
one
is
a
fan
of
the
style
dark
brown
color
with
rapidly
diminishing
head
modest
aromas
nicely
balanced
flavor
good
and
malty
low
bitterness
levels
booze
is
subdued
moderate
roastiness
carbonation
is
modest
as
well
fairly
drinkable
a
solid
b
overall
not
on
the
level
of
celebrator
but
you
could
do
worse
not
as
big
as
it
could
be
i
think
but
then
nothing
every
beer
has
to
be
a
big
bomb
anyway
right
not
bad
copper
brown
with
a
very
thick
white
head
creamy
bready
small
big
malts
a
bit
of
hoppy
citrus
notes
toffee
malts
bread
and
even
mild
coffee
in
the
taste
low
hops
note
quite
as
spicy
as
i
would
like
theres
a
very
faint
spice
to
it
hardly
even
noticeable
alcohol
not
really
noticeable
a
bit
thin
but
not
bad
needs
a
little
more
oomph
great
value
for
this
one
here
in
alberta
at
3
29
its
worth
every
penny
but
may
not
leave
a
beer
snob
impressed
quite
an
enjoyable
doppelbock
the
hops
more
evident
than
usual
for
a
european
example
of
the
style
and
the
expected
elevated
abv
not
at
all
disappointing
in
subtlety
or
in
assumed
strength
tasty
and
well
worth
saving
until
the
next
time
spring
has
a
hard
time
wresting
away
the
focus
from
a
smugly
lingering
winter
so
next
year
then
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
how
the
malts
dont
really
fade
out
through
the
finish
while
the
beer
may
appear
on
the
watery
side
and
look
more
like
a
soda
the
malts
in
the
flavoring
made
up
some
lost
ground
they
actually
became
more
robust
as
the
flavoring
wore
on
becoming
the
most
intense
by
the
end
of
the
tasting
a
style
typically
dictated
by
sweetness
this
beer
has
little
in
the
way
of
syrupy
and
sweet
characteristics
but
the
depth
of
the
appealing
toasty
flavors
falls
short
decent
but
not
a
great
value
o
im
a
fan
of
this
brewery
and
this
is
a
well
balanced
dunkel
just
an
amazing
beer
i
cant
express
how
nice
an
example
of
this
style
this
beer
really
is
based
on
other
reviews
i
have
a
feeling
this
one
was
pretty
well
aged
and
many
flaws
have
washed
away
grade
b
purchased
at
stoneys
4
99
per
bottle
overall
i
really
dug
this
one
considering
the
age
it
held
up
well
probably
tied
with
celebrator
as
my
preferred
doppelbock
and
ive
had
as
many
of
the
style
as
i
can
find
far
above
optimator
and
salvator
as
well
as
some
other
harder
to
find
imports
havent
found
a
domestic
that
compares
the
only
drawback
is
its
price
currently
3
59
for
a
bottle
this
beer
is
a
deep
copper
color
very
clear
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
metallic
slightly
acetic
and
honey
scent
the
taste
though
is
full
malt
very
sweet
a
mixture
of
melanoidinladen
and
toasty
notes
the
beer
does
not
have
as
much
complexity
and
fullness
as
most
dopplebocks
its
a
decent
and
enjoyable
beer
but
thats
about
as
far
as
it
goes
d
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
i
can
drink
and
enjoy
but
wouldnt
go
crazy
over
d
very
drinkable
for
a
doppelbocks
which
is
to
say
one
per
evening
but
you
look
forward
to
the
next
one
d
very
easy
to
drink
nice
balance
and
easy
mouthfeel
just
a
great
beer
i
didnt
like
samichlaus
on
my
first
try
but
this
one
i
definitely
dig
and
it
gives
me
light
for
this
brewery
ill
try
another
eggenberg
deep
brownishamber
one
finger
head
a
very
goodlooking
doppelbock
smell
carries
currants
raisins
figs
molasses
or
brown
sugar
breadiness
and
a
tinge
of
alcoholic
aroma
sweet
sugary
fruity
malt
with
decent
carbonation
heavier
body
for
a
doppelbock
aftertaste
is
yeastdriven
only
the
slightest
alcohol
bite
at
the
tail
end
deceptive
for
the
alcohol
content
hops
bitterness
is
rather
muted
but
suits
the
style
well
one
and
done
a
decent
dopplebock
smells
awesome
but
down
here
fom
there
mmmm
pretty
decent
pretty
good
in
a
different
way
poured
with
a
small
fine
light
tan
head
and
no
lace
color
is
a
crystal
clear
mahoganey
aroma
is
roast
malt
toffee
flavor
is
like
nose
plus
has
both
sweet
and
bitter
that
are
quite
pronounced
at
first
i
thought
it
was
too
sweet
then
i
noticed
the
bitterness
popping
up
and
taking
over
body
is
good
and
has
good
carbonation
to
cut
the
big
sweet
malt
finish
is
like
flavor
and
good
slowly
dwindling
i
tried
this
beer
on
december
13
2008
after
purchasing
from
one
of
my
local
lcbo
outlets
the
beer
poured
a
transparent
reddishbrown
with
a
very
thin
long
lasting
tan
coloured
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
malt
with
a
little
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
the
flavour
is
sweet
malt
some
caramel
some
toffee
and
little
bit
of
a
bitter
finish
first
rate
dunkler
dopplebock
d
nothing
spectacular
but
enjoyable
none
the
less
the
bitterness
and
dryness
makes
it
meh
sweet
yes
but
not
too
much
for
me
i
rather
enjoyed
this
one
as
many
doppels
seem
to
just
taste
the
same
this
seems
just
like
a
nice
traditional
take
on
this
and
that
comes
through
in
the
beer
definitely
not
bad
but
nothing
id
seek
out
again
drinkability
is
good
nicely
balanced
the
real
character
of
this
one
comes
out
once
it
has
warmed
a
little
a
nice
doppelbock
opinion
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
would
be
proud
to
have
made
it
that
said
by
todays
standards
this
beer
is
quite
sweet
and
i
guess
i
have
become
accustomed
to
the
drier
and
more
attenuatedcarbonatedoverall
lighter
on
the
palate
type
of
doppels
either
way
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
one
that
should
be
noted
especially
if
you
want
to
imo
try
something
that
may
be
more
classic
to
the
historical
side
of
the
style
i
would
certainly
drink
this
beer
again
and
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
where
the
carbonation
is
controlled
1229
i
am
confused
about
this
beer
i
dont
understand
where
its
going
well
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
not
something
i
will
be
picking
up
again
a
good
doppelbock
no
doubt
for
the
price
however
i
probably
will
not
readdress
this
for
some
time
taste
is
malt
and
caramel
and
a
little
sweet
chocolate
not
bitter
or
hoppy
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
roasted
malt
mouth
feel
is
average
overall
rather
disappointing
not
enough
spice
or
carbonation
to
interest
me
i
am
comparing
this
to
other
favorite
doppelbocks
decent
brew
where
is
that
8
5abv
hiding
its
not
obvious
at
all
while
this
is
certainly
not
the
boldest
representation
of
the
style
it
is
certainly
drinkable
id
enjoy
this
one
again
d
it
drinks
easily
enough
not
at
the
top
of
the
list
for
my
doppelbocks
but
i
one
that
is
good
enough
to
drink
again
from
time
to
time
this
beer
was
ok
but
just
ok
i
doubt
ill
ever
pick
it
up
again
this
is
an
ok
doppelbock
the
alcohol
is
too
strong
and
its
a
little
too
sweet
but
its
not
undrinkable
pours
very
dark
amber
perhaps
brown
almost
like
a
cola
nose
and
palate
are
reminiscent
of
cola
also
the
caramel
sweetness
at
least
but
brought
in
with
a
few
other
flavors
head
dissipates
quickly
and
its
just
not
terribly
aromatic
easy
drinking
but
just
not

amazing

the
swallow
a
lingering
rich
brown
sugar
sweetness
comes
on
the
finish
body
is
light
although
not
particularly
effervescent
as
is
typical
of
the
style
the
8
5
abv
is
integrated
really
well
making
this
beer
a
pleasure
to
drink
im
a
big
fan
of
doppelbocks
and
this
does
not
disappoint
cool
label
with
a
top
that
gives
the
impression
that
the
bottle
will
be
a
twist
off
perforated
around
the
cap
but
it
is
not
pours
dark
brown
with
thin
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
thin
film
smells
relatively
complex
with
roasted
malt
fruit
and
heat
first
sip
not
too
bad
with
a
flavor
that
starts
malty
a
little
sweet
and
just
a
mild
bitterness
but
finishes
up
pretty
alcoholic
not
terribly
balanced
there
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
bodied
and
maybe
a
little
thin
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
that
i
have
tried
recently
it
is
a
little
boozy
and
sweet
for
my
taste
mouthfeel
creamy
smooth
with
medium
body
and
carbonation
goes
down
very
nice
with
no
harshness
from
the
alcohol
the
carbonation
flattens
out
by
halfway
i
would
have
figured
austrians
could
make
a
dopplebock
as
good
as
their
german
neighbours
but
if
this
example
is
any
indication
id
be
wrong
ive
had
a
couple
of
less
than
stellar
offerings
from
castle
eggenberg
now
and
im
starting
to
become
a
little
less
optimistic
about
future
encounters
with
austrias
oldest
family
owned
brewery
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
lighter
brown
accents
and
a
thin
head
the
smell
is
sweet
malt
with
some
dark
fruit
and
raisins
the
taste
is
almost
all
a
combination
of
different
toasty
sweet
flavors
including
raisins
toffee
and
a
chocolate
with
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
and
some
warming
from
the
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
some
pleasant
warming
and
fine
carbonation
this
is
a
surprisingly
drinkable
beer
for
the
high
alcohol
content
an
interesting
beer
that
im
glad
i
decided
to
grab
on
a
whim
d
this
is
a
pretty
solid
doppelbock
the
alcohol
limits
its
drinkability
a
little
bit
but
it
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
worth
a
try
bottle
poured
a
clear
deep
burgundy
color
bock
with
a
large
creamy
offwhite
head
with
great
retention
and
good
lacing
aroma
of
creamy
banana
bread
with
light
toffee
notes
taste
is
a
great
mix
between
some
banana
bread
and
caramel
and
toffee
notes
body
is
a
bit
thin
or
the
style
with
great
carbonation
but
alcohol
is
bit
too
hot
very
well
done
overall
but
some
less
apparent
alcohol
would
have
been
even
better
d
potent
and
delicious
would
be
perfect
for
a
large
hefty
stein
my
deductions
are
mainly
for
the
steep
cost
i
had
to
pay
for
this
one
a
pretty
straightforward
doppelbock
nothing
really
surprising
but
certainly
worth
a
try
d
not
bad
obviously
not
something
to
put
down
a
lot
of
but
some
solid
flavour
what
a
great
doppelbock
there
are
plenty
of
malty
fruity
flavors
to
session
with
this
one
for
hours
as
it
warms
even
more
flavors
come
out
this
beer
gets
better
with
every
sip
good
sipping
beer
for
after
supper
pours
a
dark
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
that
quickly
dissapeared
aroma
of
chocolate
coffee
toffee
and
dark
fruit
very
smooth
with
the
8
5
very
well
masked
creamy
taste
of
chocolate
coffee
and
sugary
fruit
this
poured
a
clear
dark
mahogany
with
a
bit
of
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
fig
prune
raisin
and
honey
wheat
with
a
bit
of
smoke
and
wild
yeast
and
alcohol
it
tasted
like
mellow
roasted
barley
sweet
raisin
and
molasses
rusted
copper
hops
and
a
bit
of
oak
and
honey
wheat
it
was
watery
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
with
great
smell
and
tasty
flavor
and
decent
body
it
was
very
clean
and
super
easy
to
drink
and
it
hid
the
alcohol
well
but
i
preferred
to
sip
it
to
better
enjoy
the
subtleties
in
the
flavor
based
on
the
scent
i
expected
a
bigger
flavor
like
a
barleywine
or
old
ale
but
the
flavor
wasnt
nearly
that
big
it
was
almost
disappointing
but
it
was
just
too
tasty
and
drinkable
drinkability
wow
what
a
nice
big
burnt
and
roasted
doppelbock
it
had
a
great
color
a
wonderful
burnt
and
roasted
aroma
a
good
taste
and
a
decent
mouthfeel
im
glad
i
finally
decided
to
crack
open
this
doppelbock
this
is
an
under
estimated
doppelbock
pours
a
thin
cola
color
with
a
whispy
white
head
that
settled
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
of
toasted
caramel
malt
light
burnt
wood
or
peat
and
hints
of
fig
or
raisin
the
taste
is
of
a
meaty
broth
wet
wood
a
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
raisin
sweetness
the
feel
is
thin
for
a
malty
brew
and
the
alcohol
has
a
slight
noticable
presence
the
carbonation
is
thin
and
the
brew
finishes
a
tad
sweet
despite
the
8
5abv
this
brew
is
quite
drinkable
as
the
body
is
thin
some
unique
flavors
makes
this
stand
out
from
other
dopplebocks

half
an

the

the

the

beer
for

day
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
dopplebock
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
it
you
should
a
lightmedium
body
with
light
effervescence
a
plain
middle
of
the
pack
brew
not
worth
searching
for
i
honestly
dig
weihenstephaner
korbinian
more
than
this
but
id
consider
this
one
if
i
couldnt
get
the
korbinian
drinkability
very
impressive
not
to
the
point
of
ranking
this
as
good
or
better
than
a
korbinian
my
personal
favorate
doppelbock
but
damn
close
d
its
a
nice
dopplebock
but
not
amazing
high
alcohol
level
but
smooth
worthy
of
a
try
but
i
think
its
the
water
at
schlosseggenberg
that
i
dont
like
seems
highly
drinkable
despite
the
high
level
of
alcohol
a
nice
beer
to
finish
off
the
night
not
quite
as
heavy
as
some
doppelbocks
ive
had
and
not
too
cloyingly
sweet
either
overall
a
nice
example
of
the
style
alcohol
not
pronounced
at
all
despite
the
8
5
highly
drinkable
but
might
start
sitting
heavy
if
sessioned
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
not
too
complex
not
at
all
deep
but
drinkable
and
tasty
too
has
its
moments
this
had
a
clear
brown
color
and
when
held
to
the
light
had
a
ruby
color
no
head
no
lace
smelt
much
like
a
light
lager
barley
malt
and
earthy
one
of
the
best
tasting
beers
ive
had
though
sweet
malt
almost
appley
yet
with
amber
roasted
malt
caramel
and
a
light
smokey
character
backed
by
a
zesty
hop
profile
tasted
amazing
thinner
mouthfeel
than
your
average
doppelbock
not
as
meaty
but
some
spicyness
from
the
hops
and
very
smooth
couldnt
pick
up
the
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
brew
and
drank
this
at
an
enjoyable
speed
delicious
beer
though
not
your
typical
doppelbock
by
the
way
i
found
some
strange
threadlike
shaped
silicates
i
think
i
may
drink
it
again
sometime
to
take
better
notes
on
the
flavor
md
full
bodied
beer
with
medium
carbonation
drinkable
but
definitely
a
sipping
beer
i
really
liked
this
one
an
okay
doppelbock
well
rounded
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
being
above
8
d
a
bit
of
a
sipper
but
fairly
straight
forward
otherwise
alcohol
catches
up
before
long
with
anything
like
this
of
course
an
exceptional
beer
not
quite
as
good
as
the
samichlause
but
how
could
it
be
clear
deep
hue
of
burgandy
thin
and
slightly
bubbled
beige
head
it
offers
some
stickiness
to
the
glass
nice
aroma
of
raisin
rum
cinnamon
and
toffeeish
malts
rich
malt
base
with
notes
of
plum
brandy
and
brown
sugar
smooth
and
easy
going

with
an
agreeable

d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
i
guess
but
i
dont
think
this
is
really
the
right
beer
for
me
to
drink
too
many
of
something
just
didnt
strike
me
right
and
i
didnt
like
it
too
much
drinkability
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
a
real
disappointment
for
a
doppelbock
its
on
the
bottom
of
the
list
for
me
d
reasonably
drinkable
for
a
strong
beer
but
a
bit
lacking
in
complexity
and
the
sweetness
becomes
cloying
towards
the
end
of
the
bottle
overall
a
different
and
good
representation
of
the
style
very
thick
and
full
bodied
and
worth
a
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
an
interesting
and
complex
brew
but
i
have
had
better
dopplebocks
a
warming
doppelbock
malty
with
some
balance
not
overly
complex
and
there
are
better
doppelbocks
out
there
but
its
still
a
nice
one
to
sip
on
on
a
chilly
late
winterearly
spring
day
so
far
im
not
impressed
with
brewery
castle
eggenberg
maybe
samichlaus
bier
will
finally
change
my
mind
as
for
doppelbock
dunkel
there
are
any
number
of
german
doppels
or
even
a
few
from
this
country
that
deserve
your
hardearned
money
over
this
one
a
compelling
beer
it
offers
a
twist
to
the
usual
doppelbock
flavor
not
sure
id
want
it
often
as
the
syrupy
flavor
and
feel
makes
it
something
to
revisit
only
occasionally
definitely
worth
spending
some
time
with
drinkability
their
schloss
is
my
gain
prost
beertracker
not
the
best
but
definitely
enjoyable
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
sweet
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
chocolate
and
crystal
malts
along
with
a
dry
lager
yeast
aroma
there
seems
to
be
some
roasted
malt
character
as
well
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
malty
taste
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
sweet
with
a
dry
lager
yeast
element
its
not
very
exciting
there
also
seems
to
be
some
sort
of
off
flavor
in
the
finish
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
the
mouthfeel
is
average
its
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
id
buy
again
its
much
too
sweet
and
syrupy
for
me

for
a
good
experience

with
a
tarty

quite
easy
to

good
dopplebock
if
you
are
new
to
them
but
i
dont
think
i
will
seek
this
out
again
poured
a
deep
russett

with

tint
a
large
fuffy
slight
off
white
head
that
settled
into
a
creamy
mass
for
the
duration
of
the
glass
was
nice
kind
of
a
green
sour
apple

it
the
nose
along
with
some
toasted
nut
and

sweetish

tones
along
with

of

an
underlying

pretty
standard
but
good
nothing
to
go
out
of
the
way
to
find
like
i
did
today
though
d
for
the
style
and
abv
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
think
my
friend
said
he
paid
almost
5
a
bottle
so
that
would
not
make
this
on
the
top
of
my
list
as
there
are
better
beers
available
for
less
worth
a
try
though
a
clear
pale
amber
with
very
little
head
aroma
is
somewhat
boozy
with
a
lot
of
powerful
caramel
and
a
little
bit
of
what
i
think
was
anise
taste
is
caramel
again
plus
lots
of
dark
ripe
fruits
quite
sweet
and
the
carbonation
makes
me
think
of
coca
cola
at
least
in
the
nose
alcohol
is
warming
but
not
overbearing
tart
aftertaste
d
this
beer
has
a
smooth
rich
flavor
but
the
lagering
really
gave
it
a
clean
flavor
perhaps
a
bit
to
much
of
a
clean
flavor
d
fairly
average
another
spoton
choice

somewhat
syrupy
i
dont
know
about
this
one
overall
it
tastes
unblanaced
and
with
flavors
that
i
dont
really
expect
from
a
dopplebock
not
overly
impressed
and
i
dont
think
ill
be
having
this
again
d
this
one
is
quite
an
anomaly
at
least
for
me
in
the
sense
that
it
tastes
like
a
relaxed
doppelbock
which
can
be
a
good
or
bad
thing
but
the
flavors
wont
offend
it
really
just
depends
on
the
kind
of
mood
youre
in
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
head
that
hangs
around
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
nutty
notes
with
some
chocolate
and
hints
of
alcohol
the
flavor
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
it
has
a
nice
dark
malt
character
with
plenty
of
nutty
notes
but
there
is
also
an
astringency
and
grainy
character
in
there
that
takes
away
from
the
experience
the
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
flavor
as
well
the
body
is
moderate
and
the
drinkability
is
good
though
a
mild
disappointment
i
still
beleive
that
the
beer
is
worth
a
shot
the
pour
delivered
a
promising
deep
ruby
mohogany
hue
but
with
head
retention
that
started
fizzy
and
loosely
knit
and
finished
quite
flat
with
no
lacing
the
aromas
swayed
be
back
with
a
deep
almond
scent
with
heavy
notes
of
dehydrated
fruits
plumbs
dates
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
kona
coffee
and
rich
toffee
the
sweet
flavors
continues
what
was
experienced
in
the
nose
but
the
bitterness
seemed
more
distractive
than
complementary
overhopped
with
earthy
pungent
hops
later
gave
an
astingency
to
the
mouthfeel
alcohols
gain
intensity
as
the
sweetness
subsides
and
often
crossing
the
fence
to
fusal
territories
grainy
flavors
persist
into
the
aftertaste
a
rich
bready
yeasty
toasty
flavor
arises
early
but
offers
very
little
quality
to
the
body
the
body
weakens
considerably
into
the
finish
delivering
a
colalike
flavor
late
i
would
have
expected
this
lack
of
quality
from
the
majority
of
american
breweries
who
attempt
a
dopplebock
but
not
a
classic
german
brewery
d
a
decent
overall
beer
and
i
would
have
it
again
but
there
are
better
beers
out
there
all
in
all
it
was
interesting
but
the
metallicness
kind
of
ruined
it
for
me

the
taste
is
also
yummy
brown
sugars
toffee
molasses
raisin
and
maybe
cherry
but
a
tiny
almost
unnoticeable
metallic
twang
after
the
end
the
mouth
is
creamy
nicely
carbonated
lightly
warming
overall
an
interesting
doppelbock
not
my
favorite
but
one
im
glad
i
found
thanks
to
josephhaugen
at
cellars
for
recommending
it
drinkability
not
bad
but
the
optimator
i
had
before
this
one
was
better
maybe
theres
something
wrong
with
this
bottle
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
any
decentdoppelbock
that
ive
had
i
dont
recognize
any
of
the
things
that
point
to
a
poorly
kept
bottle
i
couldnt
finish
it
preferring
to
use
the
calories
on
something
i
enjoyed
overall
a
decent
brew
but
not
something
i
am
likely
to
try
again
recommended
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
and
very
smooth
with
the
low
carbonation
and
the
drinkability
is
only
decent
with
this
being
so
sweet
i
could
definitely
only
drink
one
of
these
in
a
night
despite
the
fact
that
i
cant
really
taste
it
the
alcohol
seems
to
bevery
prevalent
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
great
but
id
like
to
have
a
little
more
malt
character
and
sweetness
it
is
nice
to
have
a
relatively
clean
dopplebock
that
isnt
cloying
but
i
was
expecting
more
in
the
way
of
malty
flavors
especially
from
the
people
who
produce
samichlaus
this
has
its
highs
and
lows
and
overall
is
very
decent
worth
a
shot
but
dont
expect
to
be
wowed
the
body
is
fairly
full
with
a
crisp
carbonation
alcohol
is
subtle
but
there
overall
it
is
a
decent
doppelbock
but
far
from
a
favorite
the
drinkability
is
only
challenged
by
what
the
beer
could
be
and
not
what
it
is
it
is
nice
and
enjoyable
but
has
room
to
grow
and
refine
prosit
mk
a
nice
doppel
quite
warming
and
soft
a
nice
find
among
the
shelves
at
surdyks
in
minneapolis
perhaps
a
quarter
finger
offwhite
head
fades
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
clear
and
light
amber
in
color
smells
like
a
barleywine
smelling
bright
golden
raisins
prunes
brown
sugar
and
floral
notes
tastes
very
much
like
aromatics
picking
up
notes
of
honey
very
much
like
a
barleywine
or
even
a
mead
in
certain
aspects
mouthfeel
is
very
gentle
which
surprised
me
considering
the
strength
medium
syrupy
body
minimal
carbonation
and
warming
sensation
from
alcohol
yet
sweetness
overcomes
the
drying
feel
i
was
expecting
leaves
a
slick
oily
feel
on
mouth
with
a
lingering
aftertaste
very
interesting
beer
one
id
be
happy
to
pick
up
again
and
will
try
to
save
some
for
cellaring
from
taste
notes
appearance

brilliant

almost
looks
like
a
mix
of
a

and

smells
more
like
a
wine
with
perfumy
notes
than
a
beer
taste
a
touch
of
fruit
in
the
taste
suggesting
cherry
a
little
sweet
but
a
deft
hop
touch
on
the
end
provides
balancing
bitterness
mouthfeel
full

very
low

a

overall
sweet
and
hot
something
you
would
reach
for
instead
of
a
mixed

or
a
port
im
not
really
sure
what
to
think
of
this
beer
sweet
strong
and
malty
hard
to
find
beer
had
one
from
2007
and
it
was
absolutely
amazing
overall
i
figured
this
one
would
be
very
sweet
and
i
was
right
i
really
wanted
to
enjoy
this
one
but
it
just
isnt
for
me
overall
a
great
celebration
beer
big
bang
in
each
taste
great
mellowed
alcohol
a
sugar
daddy
like
candy
quality
that
can
be
a
bit
overwhelming
and
demands
either
sharing
the
bottle
or
taking
the
long
slow
route
with
a
water
back
im
going
to
enjoy
this
as
a
christmas
present
from
illudium
cheers
yum
such
a
rich
flavor
overall
very
tasty
and
interesting
beer
i
am
still
amazed
at
the
clean
and
simple

rather
old

i
was
hoping
for
less
sweetness
and
more

but
still
a
nice
brew
the
taste
starts
almost
overwhelmingly
sweet
like
straight
sugar
this
evolves
to
a
light
brown
sugar
and
maybe
into
a
molasses
flavor
underneath
the
date
and
sugarplum
take
hold
it
is
a
german
beer
and
later
in
the
taste
that
becomes
more
evident
to
me
a
spice
note
grabs
the
beer
first
to
counter
the
sweet
maybe
clove
or
nutmeg
in
nature
but
its
not
enough
letting
the
beer
finish
there
is
an
obvious
bitterness
that
creeps
in
to
balance
the
sweetness
but
it
probably
comes
just
a
little
late

for
a
330ml
bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
bottled
in
2012
the
taste
is
toffee
raisins
grapes
brandy
overtones
and
lots
and
lots
of
sugar
the
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
yet
a
bit
sour
its
an
interesting
combo
that
makes
this
a
unique
brew
i
cant
say
its
my
favorite
doppelbock
aventinus
is
probably
the
examplar
for
me
but
this
winter
warmer
works
despite
the
aggressive
abv
yeah
its
a
bit
boozy
and
hot
but
not
as
bad
as
many
barleywines
or
tripas
ive
had
o
this
is
a
great
beer
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
one
is
just
fine
o
it
is
a
lot
better
than
i
anticipated
it
has
a
pleasant
fruitiness
with
no
alcohol
burn
plus
it
makes
me
feel
warm
all
over
on
another
arctic
evening
in
the
midwest
o
this
is
not
a
favorite
of
mine
it
is
very
sweet
and
tart
and
might
cater
more
to
a
wine
drinker
but
for
me
it
is
too
overwhelming
in
that
respect
overall
a
lot
sweeter
than
i
imagined
if
it
didnt
have
the
booze
at
the
tail
end
this
would
be
a
very
mellow
beer
but
it
is
still
enjoyable
overall
interesting
beer
i
think
this
would
be
good
to
pair
with
some
sort
of
dessert
like
bread
pudding
maybe
and
split
with
someone
else
definitely
a
good
sharing
beer
based
on
the
abv
and
sweetness
dont
know
what
to
say
about
it
exactly
probably
should
have
tried
an
older
vintage
pretty
sure
it
would
have
been
way
better
will
buy
one
to
set
aside
for
a
while
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
tiny
chunks
of
sediment
are
seen
floating
around
in
the
beer
after
the
pour
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
toffee
fruit
and
alcohol
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
fruit
and
toffee
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
decent
alcohol
kick
with
each
sip
as
well
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
but
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
super
tasty
but
quite
boozy
and
strong
o
ive
had
lots
of
dark
samichlaus
this
is
my
first
pale
one
the
only
thing
that
could
improve
this
beer
is
a
couple
of
years
cellaring
but
my
character
is
too
weak
overall
too
sweet
for
me
but
quite
drinkable
for
a
beer
with
such
high
alcohol
on
the
bottle
this
is
described
as
malt
liquor
wouldnt
buy
again
but
not
unhappy
that
i
tried
it
pretty
good
minus
the
soy
sauce

much
like
a

into

very
fizzy
with
a
thin

that
disappears
instantly
color
is
a
a
muddy
multicolored
brown
that
almost
has
a
hint
of
green
no
head
after
pouring
the
beer
seems
barely
carbonated
aroma
is
not
nearly
as
intimidating
to
me
as
it
was
to
other
reviewers
not
unlike
the
regular
samichlaus
bier
offering
then
again
i
love
big
beers
it
smells
good
but
i
am
mostly
getting
just
very
sweet
caramel
syrup
and
malty
notes
here
taste
it
tastes
aged
and
i
just
now
realized
this
was
bottled
in
2007
as
i
sip
i
am
reminded
of
sugar
daddy
candy
until
there
is
a
distinct
sharpness
on
my
tongue
and
a
somewhat
drastic
warming
in
my
gut
some
earthiness
to
it
as
well
and
a
tiny
hint
of
chocolate
fullbodied
and
noticeable
heat
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
regular
samichlaus
i
would
say
this
is
worth
a
try
wow
a
lot
happening
here
maybe
share
the
bottle
worth
trying
for
the
experience
almost
like
drinking
medicine
o
i
cannot
give
it
anything
but
the
highest
accolades
read
the
description
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
and
you
will
agree
one
of
the
rarest
specialities
in
the
world
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
clear
medium
copper
with
a
quickly
dissipating
frothy
white
head
there
are
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
malts
toffee
booze
and
apple
its
an
inviting
aroma
the
alcohol
comes
through
pretty
strongly
in
the
taste
i
catch
the
rest
of
those
flavors
i
picked
up
from
the
nose
there
is
some
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
but
it
has
that
cloying
taste
that
sticks
to
the
mouth
theres
enough
carbonation
to
make
the
aftertaste
disappear
quickly
it
becomes
more
bready
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
abundant
carbonation
this
is
a
sipper
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
its
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
like
you
want
to
try
a
different
sort
of
doppelbock
that
pushes
the
limits
of
the
style
i
dont
love
all
aspects
of
this
but
there
is
a
lot
to
enjoy
here
sipping
is
nice
as
it
is
so
robust
that
is
fills
the
mouth
with
so
much
enjoyment
with
such
little
amounts
glad
i
tried
it
great
great
stuff
doa
pours
a
deep
pumpkin
orange
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
that
falls
over
within
minutes
decent
lacing
the
nose
is
still
pretty
aggressive
big
boozy
licorice
with
a
bit
of
dark
wood
and
raisin
on
the
tongue
this
is
just
sherry
and
not
much
else
confusingly
oxidized
for
its
age
and
comes
across
way
hotter
than
14
percent
mouthfeel
is
fine
but
overall
the
beer
is
disappointing
the
worlds
most
extraordinary
beverage
extra
ordinary
not
extraordinary
wow
what
a
great
brew
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
orange
and
gold
color
with
a
perfectly
clear
tinge
not
alot
of
head
or
lace
just
a
good
old
fashioned
high
alcohol
beer
here
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
smells
of
fermented
grains
and
sweet
alcohol
with
a
nice
bit
of
singe
to
the
note
the
beer
has
a
nice
taste
of
grains
and
alcohol
and
really
warms
up
as
it
is
going
down
leaves
a
wonderful
slight
burn
on
the
tongue
and
is
a
very
worthy
contender
in
my
book
as
one
of
the
top
10
beers
i
have
tried
without
a
doubt
a
bit
expensive
but
worth
every
penny
this
is
without
a
doubt
a
beer
that
needs
time
to
come
into
its
own
and
a
lot
of
it
is
it
worth
the
wait
only
time
will
tell
but
so
far
it
has
been
very
telling
over
all
dont
let
it
warm
up
too
much
it
is
better
cooler
not
old
but
certainly
not
as
warm
as
some
other
beers
very
similar
to
some
of
the
other
classic
long
term
cellar
beers
o
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
is
almost
overwhelming
tons
of
raisin
and
alcohol
makes
this
beer
definitely
a
sipper
88100
overall
really
rather
sweet
but
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
profile
overall
i
really
enjoy
sweeter
offerings
but
this
is
almost
too
much
i
would
prefer
it
if
it
had
more
to
offer
than
the
heavy
raisin
because
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
can
almost
imagine
how
this
would
be
if
it
were
to
make
the
leap
to
great
d
definitely
a
sipper
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
as
ive
been
holding
on
to
this
one
for
some
time
nothing
like
im
used
to
as
above
more
a
cognac
than
a
beer
for
me
i
could
see
enjoying
this
one
maybe
once
a
year
on
st
nicks
day
eve
and
next
year
maybe
splitting
the
bottle
thank
you
brad
beerguy
for
supplying
this
one
2007
vintage
pours
a
rich
golden
color
with
little
head
and
some
serious
haze
smell
is
all
booze
at
first
but
opens
up
to
caramel
and
toffee
malt
character
hops
dont
give
their
presence
until
a
sip
is
taken
for
how
boozy
this
beer
it
is
it
is
very
wellbalanced
all
is
toned
down
by
a
sweet
caramel
malt
profile
and
some
serious
floral
hop
notes
at
the
end
this
stuff
is
very
tasty
not
a
session
beer
as
one
will
do
in
a
given
night
worth
trying
though
i
want
more
flavor
is
big
and
sweet
like
the
regular
samichlaus
i
think
the
lessoctane
eggenberg
beers
are
better
they
just
have
to
find
a
way
to
cut
the
sweetness
just
a
bit
drink
overall
i
felt
this
was
a
pretty
average
attempt
at
a
beer
with
some
age
yes
the
abv
is
well
above
normal
but
needs
more
smooth
vs
harsh
and
more
flavor
besides
sweet
i
am
glad
this
was
on
sale
when
i
got
in
ks
no
need
for
full
retail
on
this
bottle
woohoo
this
beer
is
a
feat
of
beer
engineering
with
its
high
abv
and
barrel
aging
process
its
a
little
too
one
note
but
once
you
start
getting
into
the
14
its
hard
not
to
be
incredibly
sweet
especially
for
a
helles
style
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
but
its
not
a
drain
pour
i
kinda
dig
had
to
grab
this
when
i
saw
the
bottling
date
2007
was
skeptical
on
the
pour
as
big
wafts
of
a
very
alcoholdominated
wine
smell
came
my
way
still
a
nice
small
had
forms
and
some
champagne
like
bubbles
throughout
smell
is
very
dark
fruit
with
a
hint
of
winelike
alcohol
and
a
tad
of
honey
sweetness
the
taste
is
very
sweet
with
again
winelike
heat
that
reaches
the
nose
body
is
thick
almost
syrupy
with
a
hint
of
carbonation
throughout
overall
you
still
get
tons
of
darkfruit
character
a
very
nice
doppelbock
profile
on
the
whole
i
would
rate
this
very
much
worth
trying
not
sure
how
to
rate
this
beer
since
ba
has
it
in
the
doublebock
catagory
it
is
not
a
doublebock
in
the
traditional
sense
at
all
it
is
a
double
helles
maybe
but
that
does
not
really
exist
i
would
say
it
is
a
strong
lager
and
a
good
one
at
that
an
enjoyable
sipper
for
the
1
bottle
no
way
would
i
have
another
even
if
i
had
another
bottle
at
my
disposal
dthis
one
is
so
sweet
and
almost
hard
to
get
down
almost
medicinal
in
its
taste
its
not
nearly
as
palatable
as
its
sibling
the
regular
samichlaus
o
very
different
beer
its
so
sweet
and
is
almost
difficult
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
although
it
is
a
07
vintage
and
drinks
smooth
for
the
abv
as
advertised
on
the
bottle
this
guy
is
intense
in
its
sweetness
for
me
it
was
like
an
overly
sweet
candy
so
much
so
that
it
masked
the
alcohol
youd
expect
to
experience
in
a
15
abv
drink
id
rate
it
lower
if
it
werent
exactly
what
the
brewer
was
aiming
for
but
i
cant
be
too
generous
because
its
not
for
me
they
really
mean
it
when
they
say
intense
sweetness
so
if
youre
not
a
candy
sort
of
person
pass
on
this
o
the
big
sweetness
and
big
alcohol
balance
into
a
delicious
beer
candy
with
nice
fresh
wort
flavors
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
too
much
it
gets
fusel
heat
but
that
is
only
the
last
few
sips
thin
head
that
disappears
almost
completely
in
about
a
minute
bronze
colored
body
tons
of
caramel
in
the
nose
taste
of
caramel
grape
skin
and
a
little
bit
of
apple
kinda
tart
in
the
finish
the
alcohol
is
there
but
not
as
noticeable
as
you
would
expect
from
a
14
beer
o
tasty
great
flavors
lots
of
complexity
im
glad
i
picked
this
up
ill
have
to
pick
up
another
one
when
i
get
the
chance
yes
its
something
im
glad
i
tried
and
ill
look
forward
to
comparing
it
to
the
original
samichlausbut
im
pleased
the
experience
is
over
this
bottle
was
about
5
dollars
i
cannot
express
how
over
priced
that
is
given
this
beers
qualities
the
classic
samichlaus
has
many
qualities
that
make
me
certain
age
will
improve
it
it
has
some
darn
nice
effects
this
is
just
alcohol
and
sweetness
to
say
look
how
big
i
am
the
reason
this
beer
was
last
brewed
and
bottled
in
the
80s
is
because
there
wasnt
anyone
begging
for
more
this
has
a
pretty
surprising
color
for
a
doppelbock
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
honey
golden
color
with
a
head
that
fades
rather
quickley
the
14
abv
is
hardly
hidden
in
my
opinion
its
a
strong
tasting
beer
as
it
should
be
i
just
dont
know
how
much
i
enjoy
the
flavors
the
helles
gives
off
the
mouthfeel
of
this
is
on
the
thicker
side
nothing
too
heavy
but
not
watery
either
personally
i
like
the
darker
version
much
better
but
thats
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder
an
old
friend
raves
and
raves
about
this
so
i
had
to
try
it
good
recommendation
for
my
tastebuds
intense
but
refined
if
you
want
to
know
what
beer
tastes
like
5000
feet
above
barleywine
this
is
it
pours
a
very
nice
cleanclear
golden
color
very
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
sweet
nice
little
spice
note
and
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
alittle
spicy
with
some
nice
caramel
notes
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
one
is
very
tasty
a
true
delight
thanks
ben
this
one
might
smooth
out
after
a
couple
years
but
fresh
the
alcohol
is
just
too
hot
boozy
and
not
very
sneaky
about
it
there
are
some
good
notes
but
the
alcohol
is
too
much
i
poured
from
a
11
2
ounce
bottle
2009
into
a
snifter
the
color
is
medium
caramel
with
a
fizzy
1
inch
white
head
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
lots
of
astringent
alcohol
this
beer
is
very
sweet
and
has
very
hot
alcohol
kinda
out
of
balance
it
finishes
with
dates
and
raisins
the
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
good
imo
this
is
a
mess
too
much
alcohol
very
overpowering
maybe
lay
it
down
for
a
year
but
i
will
not
buy
it
again
samichlaus
helles
in
my
humble
opinion
is
light
years
away
from
being
the
worlds
most
extraordinary
beverage
its
a
decent
sipper
if
youre
into
highoctane
beer
but
thats
where
it
ends
im
okay
if
brauerei
schloss
eggenberg
wants
to
wait
another
21
years
between
bottlings
drinkability
amazed
at
how
smooth
this
monster
is
wow
great
malt
bomb
this
stuff
is
very
nice
try
it
helles
or
doppelbock
im
confused
but
im
ok
with
that
pours
golden
amber
clear
and
bubbly
with
a
head
that
quickly
settles
into
a
thin
offwhite
covering
smells
like
candied
oranges
caramel
and
a
slight
nuttiness
it
smells
good
but
like
it
may
be
too
sweet
lets
find
out
wow
that
is
sweet
this
could
probably
give
diabetics
a
contact
high
there
is
a
woodiness
and
then
sweet
a
hint
of
pepper
then
just
sugar
syrup
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
with
nice
carbonation
drinkability
is
just
going
to
depend
on
you
do
you
like
your
pancakes
to
be
nothing
but
large
sediment
in
a
vat
of
light
corn
syrup
then
youre
good
for
me
not
so
much
its
like
jane
austens
persuasion
you
want
to
experience
all
the
legend
has
to
offer
and
now
you
have
so
you
dont
have
to
drink
er
read
it
again
d
um
yeah
this
beer
is
too
over
the
top
for
its
own
good
the
extreme
alcohol
heat
and
cloying
sweetness
make
this
beer
a
night
cap
at
best
its
been
a
long
time
since
i
tasted
the
dunkel
version
but
i
would
love
to
taste
them
side
by
side
dnot
up
to
the
standard
set
by
regular
samichlaus
but
its
worth
trying
with
a
few
years
on
it
d
strong
but
alcohol
well
hidden
definitely
a
sipping
beer
slightly
easier
to
drink
that
the
original
lighter
and
alcohol
masked
better
sweeter
poured
out
a
bottle
dated
2007
the
burnt
amber
fluid
produced
minimal
head
with
a
very
slight
ring
of
retention
exceptionally
sweet
malty
smell
coaxes
me
to
imbibe
this
strong
doppelbock
surprisingly
at
14
abv
the
alcohol
has
mellowed
very
well
through
the
years
to
produce
a
sweet
slightly
cloying
and
full
bodied
concoction
balanced
with
good
carbonation
slightly
sticky
but
by
and
large
very
enjoyable
for
a
beer
of
such
potency
d
too
sweet
and
too
strong
to
be
drinkable
but
still
really
good
highly
recommended
but
not
as
good
as
the
classic
pours
an
apricotshade
of
orange
minimal
head
quickly
fades
carbonation
tosses
the
yeast
about
for
a
few
minutes
before
it
settles
down
nose
of
a
great
doppelbock
alcohol
content
clearly
high
doing
a
good
job
hiding
spicy
hops
picking
up
complexity
of
aromas
raisins
plums
cherries
apples
sweet
start
with
fruity
nose
making
a
strong
showing
in
the
taste
carbonation
is
decent
throughout
alcohol
creates
a
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
becomes
clandestine
showing
up
under
a
pleasant
bready
aftertaste
medium
body
alcohol
presence
increases
slightly
with
warming
drink
one
and
youll
be
good
to
go
got
it
at
ledgers
liqour
in
berkeley
they
have
them
refrigerated
and
the
labels
are
pretty
moldy
but
who
cares
iirc
the
bottling
was
2008
d
if
this
had
only
1011
abv
i
think
it
would
be
much
better
mmmm
all
14
blonde
doppelbocks
should
be
this
good
fairly
similar
to
the
other
samichlaus
but
sweeter
and
lighter
maybe
bordering
on
too
sweet
i
prefer
the
other
but
this
beer
is
an
experience
not
to
be
taken
lightly
worth
trying
at
least
once
to
say
you
did
i
am
able
to
enjoy
a
malt
bomb
the
more
barleywine
the
better
i
always
say
but
i
am
having
trouble
locating
anything
positive
about
the
taste
profile
of
this
malty
brew
after
the
first
sip
i
braved
one
more
but
then
could
not
continue
the
label
proudly
boasts
the
worlds
most
extraordinary
beverage
i
for
one
would
use
a
different
adjective
the
original
samichlaus
is
actually
very
good
as
is
samichlaus
helless
cheaper
counterpart
the
urbock
23
so
i
would
emphatically
recommend
avoiding
this
beer
dthis
is
just
too
sweet
to
really
enjoy
it
has
some
nice
flavors
but
all
of
the
sugar
and
sweetness
in
this
make
it
almost
difficult
to
drink
the
huge
abv
is
hidden
very
well
however
definitely
give
it
a
try
though
taste
is
a
somewhat
sweet
with
a
warming
alcohol
undercurrent
negligible
carbonation
and
a
slick
watery
mouthfeel
do
little
to
excite
the
palate
drinkability
is
respectable
at
12
but
alcohol
is
noticeable
as
the
brew
warms
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
overall
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
ok
brew
able
to
finish
the
bottle
but
will
not
be
thirsting
for
another
anytime
soon
the
taste
is
super
sweet
as
well
with
strong
banana
and
malt
prominence
through
the
intensely
sweet
and
syrupythick
mouthfeel
the
14
of
alcohol
rapidly
warms
the
mouth
and
throat
it
is
similar
to
drinking
a
sweet
pastry
lol
drinkability
for
me
is
less
than
ideal
the
alcohol
is
a
tad
harsh
and
the
sweetness
is
near
cloying
for
a
sipper
this
one
is
good
as
noted
the
alcohol
is
wellconcealed
and
its
an
easy
one
to
sip
on
d
middle
of
the
road
for
me
i
enojoyed
the
smell
more
than
the
taste
as
the
alcohol
came
out
a
little
too
much
in
the
taste
and
feel
to
me
i
have
one
bottle
left
that
is
in
my
cellar
that
i
plan
on
holding
onto
for
a
few
years
to
see
what
happens
but
right
now
i
wouldnt
look
to
drink
it
again
m
d
body
is
a
little
thin
but
fairly
hot
giving
it
a
chemicalquality
its
not
horribly
bad
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
perform
as
well
as
its
equally
strong
brother
i
dont
know
if
id
readily
go
back
for
another
it
seemed
to
lack
some
of
the
complexity
that
the
other
can
showcase
and
was
something
of
a
disappointment
ultimately
edit
looking
at
other
reviews
i
get
no
caramel
or
toffee
instead
it
is
just
a
verging
on
cloying
pale
maltiness
this
is
a
delicious
rich
and
decadent
beer
but
even
after
3
years
in
the
bottle
it
still
begs
for
more
time
i
bought
a
4
pack
with
the
intention
of
enjoying
2
now
and
2
later
after
having
my
first
and
really
enjoying
it
ive
decided
to
age
all
three
of
the
remaining
bottles
for
some
time
as
i
think
theyll
be
more
enjoyable
in
the
future
this
beer
isnt
super
easy
drinking
but
the
overall
complexity
of
the
experience
makes
up
for
it
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
super
treat
for
anybody
who
can
get
their
hands
on
one
or
a
few
if
you
want
to
lay
them
down
for
a
while
my
first
impression
of
this
beer
was
that
it
was
a
syrupy
sweet
boozy
mess
big
karo
syrup
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
a
pungent
alcoholic
bite
flat
bittering
followed
wallowing
in
the
sweet
malt
much
as
i
was
not
engaged
by
the
first
few
sips
i
found
myself
nonetheless
continuing
to
drink
to
conclusion
an
odd
disconnect
between
drinkability
and
overall
flavor
i
am
at
a
loss
to
explain
this
is
a
brilliantly
clear
orange
beer
that
smells
like
raisins
and
booze
almost
like
a
port
its
very
boozy
and
syrupy
which
is
to
be
expected
from
a
14
beer
it
has
a
honey
mildly
hoppy
aftertaste
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
for
a
massively
strong
beer
but
it
has
none
of
the
crispness
that
youd
expect
from
a
lager
im
not
sure
what
makes
it
a
helles
d
i
loved
the
initial
malt
flavor
but
couldnt
take
what
it
changed
into
definitely
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
i
barely
made
it
through
this
one
poured
from
11
2
oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
quarter
inch
head
that
lasts
only
seconds
very
clear
beer
with
a
light
copperamber
color
aroma
is
a
very
sweet
baked
pineapple
no
hop
character
in
nose
this
beer
smells
like
a
dessert
and
should
probably
be
served
as
a
dessert
beer
the
taste
is
overwhelmingly
sweet
and
one
dimensional
whatever
hops
were
used
in
this
beer
are
long
gone
leaving
only
a
lingering
bitterness
that
cant
compete
with
the
residual
sugars
even
the
high
alcohol
content
cant
cut
through
the
cloying
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
more
thick
and
chewy
than
expected
even
for
such
a
high
gravity
beer
more
like
a
liqueur
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
i
can
barely
get
through
one
bottle
better
to
split
a
bottle
with
friends
or
uninvited
guests
in
sherry
glasses
good
luck
this
beer
was
a
bright
orange
color
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
tiny
layer
of
offwhite
head
the
collar
retention
was
good
and
the
lacing
was
ok
as
well
the
aroma
was
very
complex
with
lots
of
belgian
yeast
toasted
nuts
smoked
meat
caramel
malt
and
alcohol
the
flavors
were
similarly
full
of
elements
big
candy
sugar
probably
used
to
cover
up
the
hulking
14
alc
caramel
malt
toffee
candied
nuts
some
oiled
leather
dark
fruits
and
of
course
boozy
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
was
average
the
body
was
medium
and
the
carbonation
medium
too
tasty
but
very
one
dimensional
just
too
sweet
and
alcoholic
for
my
tastes
medium
to
heavy
body
silky
and
quite
drinkable
this
would
be
a
perfect
dessert
or
after
dinner
beer
im
really
eager
to
try
the
samichlaus
classic
i
have
in
the
cellar
but
damn
if
that
is
only
half
as
good
as
this
it
will
still
be
the
second
best
doppelbock
ive
had
poured
with
a
nice
frothy
head
this
beer
was
reminiscent
of
averys
beast
but
much
better
the
nose
was
all
booze
vanilla
cognac
corn
syrup
and
grain
while
others
noted
the
taste
wasnt
complex
i
had
a
different
experience
nice
graininess
high
alcohol
which
was
warming
and
soothing
bourbon
vanilla
bean
heavy
caramel
malt
and
sweet
sweet
oak
chips
in
the
taste
i
loved
the
high
alcohol
i
suppose
the
same
people
who
make
a
sour
face
when
drinking
liquor
straight
might
say
this
was
too
much
it
was
just
right
for
me
very
tasty
much
to
offer
slick
and
oily
mouthfeel
with
mellow
carbonationjust
right
this
is
like
a
v
s
o
p
version
of
the
style
the
cognac
of
beer
no
doubt
would
absolutely
love
a
case
of
this
this
is
what
a
boss
should
drink
d
yeah
one
one
will
do
d
i
guess
i
should
have
cellared
it
first
could
finish
with
great
difficulty
i
imagine
this
beer
would
age
well
removed
the
warmth
from
the
front
end
and
mellow
out
the
solvency
of
the
flavors
this
is
a
relatively
young
for
a
sami
d
if
looking
for
a
strong
abv
might
look
for
this
otherwise
would
not
bottle
states
it
was
bottled
in
2007
and
states
it
as
the
worlds
most
extraordinary
beer
so
i
had
to
buy
it
pours
a
real
dark
brown
amber
color
with
a
small
tan
head
smells
very
sweet
and
strongly
of
alcohol
but
i
guess
that
should
be
expected
with
a
14
abv
taste
is
very
very
sweet
almost
syrup
like
with
a
touch
of
roasted
malts
in
there
maybe
if
it
was
aged
a
few
years
longer
it
would
be
better
but
i
think
ill
pass
on
this
in
the
future
it
should
be
said
that
this
is
certainly
not
an
everyday
beer
it
is
an
excellent
dessert
beer
though
its
very
easy
to
drink
but
youd
regret
drinking
multiples
in
a
single
session
this
tremendously
malty
sip
at
treat
is
quite
nice
and
tropically
set
within
a
gooey
mush
of
yummyness
it
will
warm
any
palate
quickly
and
swim
any
head
that
drinks
it
down
just
as
quickly
as
it
should
mfd
as
mentioned
above
i
think
the
drinkability
will
suffer
because
it
is
too
sweet
maybe
it
should
be
a
dessert
beer
the
feel
is
pretty
good
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
the
body
is
just
enough
syrupy
to
be
a
x2
bock
im
guessing
that
because
it
is
the
helles
bock
the
feel
is
a
bit
thinner
understandable
but
not
desirable
d
to
me
this
beer
is
just
over
done
too
much
alcohol
too
much
sweetness
without
any
hop
character
d
this
beer
is
wonderful
as
a
nightcap
but
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
unfortunately
this
beer
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
it
poured
a
golden
orange
with
a
fizzy
soda
pop
head
that
disappeared
and
i
couldnt
make
it
return
no
matter
how
much
swirling
i
have
to
say
the
smell
was
the
best
part
honey
euro
hops
clove
and
alcohol
it
is
14
this
beer
is
on
fire
plenty
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
some
honey
and
bread
are
all
that
were
left
thin
and
astringent
in
the
mouth
i
found
it
odd
that
a
beer
this
strong
could
be
watery
some
lingering
cloying
sweetness
and
fire
in
the
belly
14
but
not
a
lot
of
depth
this
one
is
one
and
done
i
would
sample
again
if
offered
but
it
would
have
to
be
aged
for
510
years
overall
id
say
that
for
a
beer
brewed
3
years
ago
this
is
still
very
young
if
youve
got
a
cellar
going
toss
this
down
there
for
a
few
more
years
and
give
it
another
go
i
wouldnt
drink
this
fresh
again
this
is
drinkable
but
the
abv
is
very
apparent
tastes
smells
almost
more
like
liquor
than
beer
pours
dark
amber
with
little
to
no
head
malty
aroma
accents
of
malt
chestnuts
and
pears
alcohol
makes
a
very
strong
presence
at
the
finish
so
sweet
as
to
induce
gagging
an
unpleasant
brew
felt
like
i
was
drinking
cough
syrup
on
the
other
hand
i
admire
the
bottle
design
poured
from
the
bottle
to
my
tulip
glass
golden
pour
tiny
head
that
left
a
light
lacing
strong
nose
of
malts
strong
taste
of
alcohol
and
malts
however
the
lightness
of
the
mouthfeel
made
is
most
enjoyable
i
also
detected
a
fruitiness
in
there
mixed
with
the
malts
a
truly
superb
beer
from
start
to
finish
not
for
all
to
enjoy
only
those
with
a
true
appreciation
for
the
higher
abvs
will
appreciate
this
helles
smells
of
honey
tropical
fruits
dried
fruits
and
even
almonds
or
hazelnuts
or
similar
licorice
caramel
silky
sweet
maybe
too
sweet
flavor
palate
is
similar
orange
honey
hazelnuts
only
add
a
touch
of
oak
the
finish
is
more
like
an
orange
liquor
than
a
brandy
a
difference
to
the
samichlaus
we
all
know
the
only
bad
thing
that
i
could
find
is
that
i
would
have
like
it
a
little
less
sweetness
but
when
you
have
a
beer
like
this
who
cares
im
not
enamored
by
this
one
but
its
definitely
a
solid
beer
the
flavors
definitely
reveal
themselves
as
this
beer
warms
much
more
pronounced
but
so
is
the
big
alcohol
character
of
this
beer
very
drinkable
at
14
but
2
is
enough
for
anyone
there
is
no
doubt
this
beer
warms
from
the
inside
out
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
foam
was
a
light
wheatwhite
which
dissapated
very
quickly
witha
small
ring
afterwards
the
color
was
nice
golden
honey
with
hints
of
red
and
orange
in
the
light
taste
was
exceptional
it
was
darker
and
heavier
than
percieved
by
color
it
also
had
berry
undertones
smell
crisp
clean
and
a
variety
of
exotic
complex
fruity
hints
mouthfeel
was
deep
drinkibility
smooth
and
rich
a
nice
aquired
taste
a
750ml
bottle
shared
with
my
wife
it
didnt
look
like
a
doppelbock
being
a
pretty
light
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
caramel
malt
and
honey
aroma
the
alcohol
hits
you
in
the
face
when
you
take
a
sip
followed
by
a
strong
malt
presence
and
a
pervasive
incredible
sweetness
this
beer
was
way
too
sweet
and
the
alcohol
was
way
too
intrusive
i
doubt
ill
be
drinking
this
beer
again
conclusion
this
is
not
something
id
drink
often
but
it
would
be
quite
nice
to
split
with
the
lady
after
a
nice
meal
not
my
favorite
dopplebock
and
quite
light
in
color
for
the
style
originally
thought
this
was
a
hopped
up
version
of
a
helles
lager
and
i
seemed
to
be
wrong
after
the
very
first
sip
i
took
not
in
a
hurry
to
drink
this
again
a
little
too
strong
in
my
opinion
worth
trying
pale
colored
beer
with
a
thin
wispy
white
foam
strong
malt
aroma
hints
of
light
golden
fruits
and
caramel
flavor
is
intensely
sweet
and
intensely
flavored
nicely
balanced
with
well
hidden
alcohol
this
beauty
deliverers
strong
complex
malt
notes
of
golden
raisin
caramel
and
toffee
should
drink
well
for
a
decade
picked
up
a
single
at
half
off
pricing
i
had
the
regular
samichlaus
years
ago
and
remembered
it
was
sweet
and
that
i
took
a
nap
afterwards
the
helles
follows
very
sweet
but
not
cloying
no
nap
this
time
this
is
definitely
a
bit
too
sweet
i
was
expecting
a
malt
bomb
good
but
instead
this
seems
like
a
sugar
bomb
bad
im
not
sure
how
well
it
would
age
but
im
sure
itd
be
sickly
sweet
by
then
too
sweet
for
me
i
can
barely
finish
this
beer
by
itself
it
would
go
well
paired
with
something
equally
sweet
not
my
favorite
but
worth
a
try
overall
a
good
beer
not
great
this
would
be
a
nice
dessert
beer
to
go
with
a
cake
or
something
its
a
little
too
sweet
at
the
end
and
a
little
less
than
sharp
in
the
mouthfeel
but
it
is
worth
trying
to
see
something
different
overall
about
what
i
expected
and
a
good
choice
to
loosen
things
up
overall
i
like
this
one
better
than
its
cousin
it
has
a
spicy
warming
alcohol
mouth
feel
the
finish
is
sweet
and
linger
on
the
palate
for
a
few
moments
the
is
a
very
strong
beer
that
will
put
u
at
one
or
two
sheets
i
just
dont
understand
how
both
samichlaus
are
rated
with
a
measly
b
these
are
world
class
beers
in
my
opinion
easily
the
two
best
doppelbocks
ever
and
ive
had
quite
a
few
i
can
sum
this
beer
up
in
a
few
word
i
need
more
d
a
warm
winter
lager
that
lights
you
up
like
a
christmas
tree
cheers
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
ton
of
initial
head
although
it
goes
away
quickly
no
lacing
but
a
lot
of
lasting
carbonation
very
deep
scent
extremely
malty
with
some
caramal
undertones
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
a
very
strong
hint
of
alcohol
deep
taste
slight
fruity
esters
to
go
with
the
deep
malt
and
caramal
notes
although
the
alcohol
sticks
out
enough
to
take
away
from
some
of
the
flavor
fairly
rough
due
to
its
high
abv
although
not
as
rough
as
it
could
be
a
nice
hellesdopplebock
merger
the
history
of
the
beer
is
great
although
the
cost
is
pretty
prohibitive
luckily
this
was
a
gift
from
a
friend
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
wouldnt
hesitate
to
drop
some
coin
on
some
of
these
in
the
future
tastes
sweet
fruity
and
shows
less
of
its
alcohol
than
anticipated
a
little
too
sickly
sweet
for
my
tastes
syrupy
mouthfeel
a
very
slow
sipper
the
alcohol
isnt
as
difficult
as
the
sweetness
and
really
holds
back
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
exciting
concept
that
fails
with
me
in
practice
very
sweet
very
drinkable
for
its
potency
and
a
kickass
brew
to
boot
worth
the
experience
for
sure
very
nice
brew
more
of
something
to
sip
and
not
gulp
very
warm
on
the
way
down
huge
beer
requires
patience
and
determination
to
finish
worth
it
though
d
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
be
appreciated
very
slowly
and
infrequently
i
didnt
quite
know
what
to
expect
from
this
one
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
was
surprised
i
have
another
11
2
oz
bottle
of
this
that
i
will
probably
let
age
for
a
couple
more
years
i
cellared
this
one
for
about
11
months
oh
man
the
finish
is
amazing
the
bananaplantain
thing
comes
in
and
out
of
focus
for
minutes
after
the
sip
im
going
to
go
make
some
seared
dryrubbed
pollack
and
some
red
beans
and
rice
to
have
with
this
drinkability
if
it
werent
for
the
obvious
and
detrimental
alcohol
heat
and
astringency
that
overwhelms
the
rest
of
the
drinking
experience
maybe
itd
be
more
drinkable
as
it
is
this
stuff
is
very
difficult
to
finish
even
when
sipped
slowly
certainly
not
a
drain
pourtype
of
beer
but
probably
just
a
beer
thats
not
ready
yet
let
these
babies
sit
in
your
cellar
or
on
the
retailers
shelves
for
a
year
or
two
before
popping
one
open
deliciously
delicate
and
hardhitting
a
musthave
for
any
fan
of
big
malty
brews
and
for
fans
of
doppel
and
eisbocks
alike
doppelbock
is
really
a
misnomer
as
the
triple
bock
designation
given
in
don
russells
book
christmas
beer
is
much
more
appropriate
for
a
bockbier
this
huge
the
mouthfeel
is
very
full
the
bite
of
the
gingery
spiciness
combined
with
the
sweet
fullness
of
the
creamy
cherryspice
flavor
make
this
a
fantastic
holiday
treat
i
hope
to
enjoy
each
year
cheers
st
nick
an
interesting
beer
though
im
not
sure
id
want
to
order
it
again
the
combination
of
sweetness
and
high
alcohol
is
just
too
much
and
make
this
a
difficult
beer
to
drink
drinkability
well
what
do
you
expect
with
a
14
0
abv
beer
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
slowly
perhaps
over
an
hour
and
a
half
so
i
dont
feel
too
terribly
buzzed
but
you
really
gotta
be
careful
with
this
one
i
cant
classify
a
beer
i
had
to
take
an
hour
and
a
half
to
savor
as
drinkable
nonetheless
its
a
fairly
tasty
and
definitely
interesting
concoction
and
though
its
not
something
im
gonna
buy
a
fourpack
of
so
i
can
whip
one
out
after
mowing
the
lawn
its
still
something
you
should
try
at
least
once
definitely
worth
a
try
here
reminds
me
a
bit
of
an
old
ale
and
other
high
abv
styles
which
i
havent
been
a
big
fan
of
yet
this
is
certainly
well
crafted
and
impressed
me
really
nice
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
it
pours
a
pinkish
blush
color
with
miniscule
white
head
that
dissapears
very
quickly
sweet
aroma
of
alcohol
cherry
and
candi
sugar
very
sweet
tasting
with
cherry
grape
sugar
cane
notes
and
a
very
strong
alcohol
presence
this
beer
is
not
very
flavorful
and
the
strong
alochol
warmth
makes
it
not
very
quaffable
pours
a
clear
caramel
with
no
head
or
bubbling
makes
me
think
cognac
not
a
dopplebock
very
cool
looking
caramel
drizzled
strawberries
pears
and
peaches
with
a
spanking
of
alcohol
that
makes
presence
known
but
is
well
intergrated
carameled
and
sugared
peaches
starts
the
flavor
off
right
lots
of
other
soft
yet
sugary
sweet
fruits
dance
around
the
palate
with
a
turbocharge
of
alcohol
lots
of
sweetness
with
this
palate
very
syrupy
the
alcohol
helps
cu
the
iscociy
a
little
any
bitterness
you
notice
is
not
from
hops
but
the
14
abv
great
sipping
beer
one
of
the
best
sipping
lagers
ive
ever
had
this
poured
a
clear
light
copper
with
a
bit
of
white
head
it
smelled
like
an
old
ale
with
heavy
honey
wheat
and
and
molasses
and
alcohol
with
some
apricot
hops
it
tasted
much
bigger
than
the
dunkel
or
urbock
like
very
sweet
honey
and
caramel
and
cane
sugar
with
a
bit
of
barley
pineapple
new
oak
and
alcohol
it
was
slightly
thick
with
no
carbonation
and
had
a
sweet
aftertaste
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
warming
overall
this
was
borderline
too
sweet
but
was
otherwise
very
tasty
it
was
clean
and
had
a
nice
body
the
big
flavor
and
noticeable
alcohol
makes
this
a
definite
sipping
beer
this
was
very
much
like
an
old
ale
which
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
i
wonder
if
age
would
make
this
one
too
sweet
the
flavor
is
doppelbockesque
with
a
thick
rich
malt
base
that
has
a
highoctane
orange
charge
in
it
what
the
brewer
has
mastered
though
is
the
blending
of
the
big
alcohol
and
the
sweetish
malts
its
like
a
liquid
malt
love
of
some
kind
either
way
it
is
an
amazing
production
and
as
a
helles
db
in
a
class
all
by
its
lonesome
self
this
is
actually
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
d
i
generally
prefer
that
the
beers
that
i
drink
do
not
burn
my
sinuses
with
that
being
said
ill
pass
on
this
next
time
or
at
cellar
for
many
years
before
attempting
to
drink
it
again
apparently
this
is
a
lighter
version
of
this
beer
for
the
american
market
time
will
tell
if
this
works
though
i
cant
imagine
that
anyone
but
beer
enthusiasts
buys
this
lager
and
they
are
not
going
to
be
put
off
by
a
heavier
beer
personally
i
dont
think
this
matches
the
original
beer
and
i
think
ill
stick
to
that
but
im
interested
to
see
how
their
experiment
works
out
drinkability
alcohol
is
nicely
hidden
in
this
one
really
hard
to
keep
from
chugging
this
rather
than
sipping
super
easy
to
drink
will
have
again
in
the
future

with
how
easy

the

isnt

this
is

perfect

pick
some
of

up
instead
again
this
is

i
knew
it
going
in
and
i
know
it
now
but
geez
it
doesnt
taste
like
it
d
the
lighter
cousin
of
samichlaus
definitely
a
good
beer
even
if
i
prefer
the
darker
version
in
my
opinion
definitely
recommended
overall
i
think
this
is
an
ok
beer
and
it
makes
for
a
decent
evening
beer
given
its
sweetness
and
high
abv
id
recommend
it
for
a
try
the
flavor
is
of
high
alcohol
and
big
fruit
i
would
love
to
drink
another
but
1
i
dont
have
another
one
and
2
i
dont
think
i
could
get
the
cap
off
this
one
hits
kinda
hard
drink
this
one
slowly
and
carefully
by
the
fire
or
after
a
huge
meal
this
would
be
a
great
digestive
d
this
is
like
drinking
maple
syrup
directly
from
the
bottle
its
a
taste
bomb
but
only
tolerable
in
moderate
amounts
how
is
this
a
doppelbock
imperial
maibock
is
more
like
it
although
thats
just
my
own
silly
interpretation
whatever
the
case
dont
pick
up
the
redlabel
helles
if
youre
expecting
the
normal
samichlausthis
aint
it
and
thats
better
its
enjoyable
to
some
degree
and
theres
something
to
be
said
for
being
able
to
make
an
11
2
oz
bottle
last
some
90
minutes
or
so
proceed
with
cautionits
not
the
greatest
of
the
big
classic
big
beers
cheers
drinkability
would
take
either
one
of
us
a
long
while
to
finish
an
entire
bottle
we
split
it
which
worked
out
ok
but
neither
one
of
us
wanted
another
sweetness
is
sickening
at
times
and
alcohol
is
extremely
high
this
was
more
of
a
novelty
than
anything
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
overall
nearly
undrinkable
drinkability
i
am
wondering
how
easily
i
am
going
to
finish
this
one
not
nearly
as
easy
to
drink
as
the
regular
samichlaus
and
the
bitterness
doesnt
really
sit
very
well
im
glad
i
found
it
to
try
it
but
i
will
stick
to
the
regular
one
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
definitely
dry
finish
on
the
palate
lighter
on
the
palate
than
one
expects
for
a
doppelbock
carbonation
the
color
and
the
clarity
of
this
brew
lead
to
this
impression
medium
bodied
this
is
one
that
im
glad
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
try
but
i
doubt
that
ill
reach
for
it
again
anytime
soon
there
are
much
better
out
there
just
nothing
all
that
great
about
this
brew
nothing
to
pull
one
back
to
it
time
and
time
again
good
not
as
good
as
samichlaus
i
dont
think
my
memory
of
the
other
from
just
last
night
had
the
malt
flavors
as
being
a
lot
more
complex
this
seems
like
well
a
helles
version
of
the
same
beer
weird
i
mean
its
good
and
id
definitely
drink
it
again
but
id
rather
have
the
other
one
i
think
i
suppose
ill
have
to
buy
both
again
and
compare
side
by
side
to
really
know
maybe
anyway
seems
to
have
less
mouthfeel
and
even
less
bitterness
still
rich
and
thick
with
a
complex
malt
profile
still
sweet
and
smooth
my
winedrinking
buddies
said
that
it
tastes
like
a
nice
sauternes
d
more
like
a
beefed
up
helles
than
the
dopplebock
listed
on
ba
very
sweet
with
a
good
touch
of
alcohol
i
wonder
how
this
would
do
with
some
time
to
mellow
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
pretty
low
all
alcohol
and
no
flavor
i
can
detect
the
munich
helles
behind
it
but
its
not
as
subtle
as
i
would
like
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
i
think
a
bit
of
age
on
the
bottle
would
help
remove
some
of
the
harsh
alcohol
aromas
from
the
nose
but
the
flavor
was
wonderful
worth
trying
but
if
it
has
to
be
one
or
the
other
id
go
for
the
bier
body
is
big
sticky
and
slick
the
sugars
make
my
lips
stick
together
limited
drinkability
due
to
the
asskicking
strength
suggestions
of
herbal
hops
and
alcohol
lead
off
the
palate
but
are
quickly
overwhelmed
by
sweet
sugary
malts
rummy
fruits
and
rich
honey
sweetness
dominate
chewy
and
almost
cloying
with
hints
of
vanilla
tropical
fruits
and
cotton
candy
avoids
being
too
cloying
with
some
warming
alcohol
and
some
cooked
vegetable
flavors
in
the
finish
a
big
warming
dessert
beer
similar
to
regular
samichlaus
but
maybe
missing
some
of
the
depth
and
carameliness
of
the
original
prost
beertracker
if
not
for
the
easily
identifiable
alcohol
this
would
be
rated
higher
guess
ill
need
to
buy
another
bottle
to
age
and
see
if
it
mellows
out
pours
golden
with
very
little
head
what
head
there
is
fades
to
nothing
very
quickly
very
malty
aroma
quite
honeyed
and
bready
quite
sweet
with
some
definite
heat
and
some
lingering
spicy
bitterness
on
the
finish
up
front
it
is
quite
smooth
abd
honeyed
a
bit
like
nougat
very
smooth
but
a
bit
hot
in
the
mouth
this
is
fairly
pleasant
but
i
find
it
a
bit
more
one
dimensional
than
the
regular
samichlaus
d
for
a
high
alcohol
beer
i
find
it
to
be
very
drinkable
had
this
as
a
night
cap
last
night
and
man
did
it
help
me
sleep
easy
poured
into
a
pokal
a
full
rich
clear
golden
with
a
minimal
head
wich
was
to
be
expectedwhoo
the
sweet
alcohol
really
hits
in
the
nose
with
some
caramel
and
grain
but
the
alcohol
shows
itself
in
a
huge
way
a
full
bodied
sweeter
sipping
brewit
has
a
big
caramel
and
fruit
flavor
with
sweet
burning
alcohol
showing
thru
more
as
it
warmedin
the
finish
a
passing
vegetal
note
comes
thru
a
decent
brew
but
its
made
to
be
drank
slow
and
easy
appearance
is
slightly
hazy
orange
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
lingers
for
a
moment
then
settles
in
a
ring
around
the
glass
faint
smells
of
bready
malt
with
notes
of
cherries
and
raisins
in
the
background
noble
hops
finally
appear
as
the
beer
warms
up
a
bit
tastes
much
more
upfront
with
loads
of
bready
malt
blended
with
flowery
noble
hops
medium
to
mediumfull
body
balanced
decently
with
moderate
carbonation
and
you
can
definately
detect
that
14
abv
with
a
decent
alcohol
warmth
as
you
swallow
but
its
not
a
harsh
finish
at
all
overall
a
nicely
balanced
beer
for
such
a
high
abv
and
definately
worth
seeking
out
finish
is
warming
with
plenty
of
alcohol
presence
d
enjoyed
more
sips
then
didnt
due
to
the
heft
and
oiliness
of
the
beer
i
cant
see
having
to
many
in
one
sitting
plus
with
the
14
you
might
not
be
able
to
stand
after
2
bottles
very
good
after
dinner
beer
as
a
desert
the
super
sweetness
makes
this
one
a
tough
drink
a
very
sweet
brew
that
has
enough
abv
to
really
kick
your
ass
alcohol
presence
is
not
nearly
what
you
would
expect
from
a
14
beer
that
cant
hide
behind
strong
ingredients
like
hops
decent
but
the
regular
samichlaus
is
far
more
interesting
a
subtle
twist
on
the
standard
samichlaus
with
a
lighter
color
and
more
finess
in
the
malts
but
with
a
lot
of
fruity
character
comming
throughout
a
standard
pilsnerstraw
color
comes
through
with
light
carbonation
and
with
only
a
trace
of
head
formation
and
retention
aromas
are
strong
of
pilsner
malt
honey
and
zinfindale
no
real
sulfers
or
corn
flavors
so
pretty
clean
upfront
just
a
lot
more
estery
than
expected
from
a
lager
flavors
jump
on
the
peach
pear
mango
appricot
papaya
flavors
and
wonder
into
a
meadlike
zinfindale
acidity
and
alcohols
an
herbal
hop
flavor
is
noticed
in
the
aftertaste
and
provides
lowlying
bitterness
very
syrupy
and
viscously
textured
while
warming
the
mouth
into
numbness
light
on
fusals
finishes
with
a
long
sweet
linger
of
fruitiness
sugars
and
herbal
tea
drinkability
is
fantastic
for
the
abv
pretty
good
for
the
style
nice
digestivenightcap
dopple
not
one
to
trifle
with
or
to
attempt
to
session
on
next
time
i
see
it
i
will
buy
more
hide
them
from
myself
see
how
the
aging
improves
or
doesnt
this
fine
dopple
definitely
a
sipper
of
a
beer
strong
juju
magic
here
this
is
ok
but
at
8
for
the
bottle
i
will
be
drinking
firestone
union
jack
a
lot
more
than
this
one
tastes
good
the
alcohol
balances
the
caramel
sweetness
perfectly
this
is
a
slow
sipper
and
sweet
but
not
cloying
or
over
the
top
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
for
such
an
abv
powerhouse
over
a
long
evening
i
would
welcome
2
of
them
but
probably
regret
it
later
in
all
a
very
tasty
beer
ideal
for
a
nightcap
or
winter
warmer
from
a
750ml
swing
top
bottle
pours
a
clear
pale
amber
color
with
minimal
headlacingcap
the
aroma
is
somewhat
faint
notes
of
juicy
fruit
and
white
wine
the
taste
is
sugary
sweet
some
honey
and
a
bit
of
berry
fruit
but
really
just
a
sugary
alcohol
bomb
the
feel
is
light
and
quite
fizzy
very
slick
and
sticky
finishes
very
sweet
and
suprisingly
astringent
the
drinkability
is
very
limited
with
this
one
if
you
are
looking
for
an
after
dinner
brew
maybe
6oz
this
might
be
a
fine
selection
but
other
than
that
this
is
almost
undrinkable
very
sweet
and
the
alcohol
is
not
hidden
no
malt
or
hops
to
help
mask
the
booze
not
all
that
good
not
sure
how
dopplebock
was
decided
upon
maybe
the
first
uber
imperial
helles
lager
while
it
isnt
as
interesting
as
the
darker
stuff
this
bright
beer
is
a
lethal
alcohol
delivery
system
thanks
to
its
incredible
drinkability
treat
this
bottle
with
respect
and
enjoy
this
is
a
sipper
i
shared
this
with
3
people
dont
know
if
i
would
be
able
to
down
an
entire
bottle
myself
a
slow
slow
sipper
a
bit
raw
maybe
aging
would
mellow
the
sharpness
of
it
interesting
to
a
degree
though
not
in
a
complex
way
i
didnt
enjoy
this
as
much
as
the
other
samichlaus
md
medium
bodied
semihigh
carbonation
alcohol
is
there
obviously
drinkability
is
fair
not
as
good
as
the
other
samichlaus
dopplebock
overall
a
very
pleasant
beer
definitely
an
easy
way
to
get
drunk
hv
drinkability
many
of
these
high
abv
beers
are
a
joy
to
drink
and
deftly
hide
their
alchol
amidst
a
truly
succulent
taste
the
samichlaus
helles
is
neither
of
those
as
with
its
darker
brother
hopefully
some
time
locked
away
will
bring
some
sense
to
it
drinkability
a
malty
high
alcohol
beer
that
is
a
very
slow
sipper
one
is
enough
in
any
session
overall
this
is
not
a
beer
id
pursue
ever
again
yes
its
undeniably
complex
but
the
taste
is
a
little
on
the
tough
side
overall
its
remarkably
well
done
the
alcohol
is
kept
in
check
and
its
balanced
the
flavor
is
rich
and
satiating
but
not
cloying
this
is
truly
liquid
bread
the
appearance
is
great
but
the
head
could
be
much
better
and
the
aroma
is
right
on
worth
trying
i
could
even
see
using
this
as
a
cordial
at
a
christmas
dinner
very
nice
11
2oz
bottle
poured
into
a
chalice
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
the
aroma
features
some
malt
a
touch
of
caramel
and
a
good
whiff
of
alcohol
the
taste
to
no
surprise
starts
out
smooth
and
malty
and
finishes
with
a
warming
alcohol
punch
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
offering
it
is
just
not
my
thing
red
label
samichlaus
helles
was
picked
up
in
a
12
oz
brown
bottle
and
poured
into
a
goblet
the
beer
came
out
fizzy
and
developed
almost
no
head
but
the
body
was
a
crystal
clear
pale
gold
the
smell
was
quite
a
fruity
and
alcoholic
treat
lots
of
pears
apples
and
grapes
on
the
nose
soaked
in
cognac
the
taste
was
warm
sweet
and
well
it
was
hard
to
get
past
the
sweet
the
spices
anise
and
pepper
vanilla
and
fruits
were
all
drizzled
in
lots
of
powdered
sugar
some
might
find
this
level
of
sweetness
cloying
but
i
found
the
strong
countering
by
the
drying
alcohol
a
sufficiently
palatable
combination
as
i
got
further
along
some
hop
bitterness
showed
up
as
well
very
richly
textured
and
oh
so
warming
some
might
consider
this
a
good
fireside
sipper
but
id
be
beware
of
igniting
the
vapors
fits
all
the
classic
definitions
of
a
cellarable
a
beer
and
i
sure
will
be
stashing
away
some
for
a
decade
or
more
to
get
it
to
peak
very
drinkable
for
a
14
abv
beer
looks
a
clear
gold
without
much
head
retention
the
aroma
is
of
white
grape
and
sweet
bready
malt
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
is
rough
to
say
the
least
theres
a
strong
dry
alcohol
flavor
in
line
with
watereddown
vodka
the
malt
just
comes
off
like
a
very
concentrated
light
lager
with
caramel
malt
ad
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
its
not
allout
offensive
but
i
wont
be
finishing
this
one
ill
return
to
this
one
after
i
let
a
bottle
mellow
for
a
year
or
two
prosit
und
zum
wohl
mk
highly
recommended
very
nice
brew
easy
to
drink
even
with
the
booze
wallop
but
the
17
for
a
4pack
of
11
2ozs
puts
a
hurt
on
the
wallet
pretty
good
in
small
doses
but
know
what
youre
getting
overall
an
interesting
experience
but
really
makes
you
appreciate
some
high
abv
beers
that
do
a
better
job
of
hiding
it
this
definitely
needs
some
time
in
the
bottle
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
a
cold
evening
for
malt
lovers
only
d
a
great
beer
yet
i
like
the
doppelbock
version
a
bit
more
the
alcohol
is
certainly
there
but
its
not
overpowering
strangely
enough
this
is
like
a
beerbrandy
great
nightcap
bottle
from
city
wide
in
south
bend
pours
golden
orange
to
yellow
soda
like
bubbles
ringing
the
outside
laces
like
a
scotch
odor
is
fruity
clean
hints
of
teak
apples
mild
cherry
brandy
taste
is
burning
warming
alcohol
grapes
raspberry
and
sweet
toffee
alcohol
is
almost
a
flavor
in
itself
sweet
malt
backbone
the
whole
thing
seems
understated
but
at
the
same
time
huge
and
demanding
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
and
thick
like
congealing
jello
overall
its
a
sipper
a
beer
liquor
warming
a
smooth
and
pretty
impressive
dgreat
considering
it
was
14
alcohol
it
did
not
taste
hot
at
all
definitely
something
that
can
get
me
in
trouble
still
good
but
id
take
the
original
over
this
one
any
day
also
in
a
blind
test
doppelbock
would
not
come
to
mind
more
like
an
old
ale
but
obviously
it
isnt
an
ale
2007
bottling
with
the
red
and
silver
label
as
pictured
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
body
with
a
skimpy
white
head
that
quickly
falls
into
a
film
aroma
is
malty
and
bready
with
some
phenolics
that
suggest
a
dogfish
head
120
some
vague
floral
hops
medium
body
with
a
somewhat
syrupy
mouthfeel
malty
and
earthy
taste
with
some
floral
hops
warming
alcohol
is
very
whiskey
like
a
nice
sipper
on
a
winter
night
but
i
prefer
the
regular
samichlaus
to
this
helles
this
one
could
use
some
more
aging
this
is
definitely
a
good
beer
although
i
dont
see
how
its
all
that
much
different
from
the
regular
samichlaus
besides
the
color
i
guess
ill
have
to
force
myself
to
do
a
sidebyside
at
some
point
nonetheless
this
is
a
good
beer
to
end
an
evening
and
a
musttry
for
lovers
of
strong
beers
recommended
d
depends
what
you
want
this
is
clearly
a
good
beer
but
it
is
very
strong
i
think
it
needs
some
time
to
age
before
drinking
right
now
1
year
old
it
is
too
sharp
but
next
year
i
wll
happily
try
this
again
and
put
next
year
batch
down
to
rest
i
am
by
no
means
a
helles
bock
expert
so
this
is
my
mucho
ignorant
review
a
transparent
goldamber
color
no
head
just
a
haze
here
and
there
smells
very
sweet
borderline
barley
wine
smell
tastes
like
a
weak
barley
wine
sweet
tangy
but
not
a
whoa
necktwisting
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
tart
a
nice
kind
of
tart
though
and
a
bit
crisp
as
well
as
for
drinkability
its
not
such
a
quick
drinker
or
a
multiple
bottle
in
a
night
kind
of
beer
i
will
drink
this
again
but
in
about
5
to
10
years
once
it
has
had
time
to
mature
pours
a
thin
clear
lager
yellow
with
little
to
no
head
nose
is
of
an
intense
lager
the
taste
is
very
very
interesting
it
is
very
thin
up
front
but
quickly
turns
to
some
dark
fruit
taste
didnt
expect
that
this
is
very
tasty
and
has
almost
a
barleywine
sugar
taste
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
and
the
aftertaste
lingers
forever
i
actually
occasionally
prefer
this
to
samichlaus
good
brew
should
do
great
in
my
cellar
d
for
the
high
alcohol
content
this
was
a
smooth
drink
but
dangerous
light
honey
gold
color
with
virtually
no
head
and
little
carbonation
the
aroma
was
that
of
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
my
girlfriend
the
veterinary
technician
claimed
she
smelled
male
rat
musk
hmm
serious
rubbing
alcohol
flavor
bringing
up
secondary
aromas
of
new
bandaids
as
the
beer
warmed
up
there
was
a
more
pronounced
flavor
of
honey
mead
and
then
aroma
turned
into
an
urban
alley
frequented
by
beer
drinking
bladder
relievers
there
was
good
and
bad
in
this
i
dont
think
it
wise
for
a
beer
with
so
much
alcohol
to
be
attempted
with
such
lighter
malts
as
all
manner
of
trouble
shows
through
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
two
of
these
in
an
evening
but
for
its
strength
its
an
easy
beer
to
drink
urbock
23
on
steroids
i
hope
that
eggenberg
keeps
making
this
one
pours
medium
gold
very
clear
and
with
a
medium
but
quickly
fading
head
aroma
is
almost
pure
malt
very
little
hops
but
some
alcohol
does
come
through
although
very
cleanly
in
the
aroma
palate
is
full
and
appropriate
flavor
is
a
wonderful
malty
alcoholic
and
very
clean
beer
ubermaibock
anyone
quite
an
interesting
brew
and
one
ill
certain
to
keep
around
for
winter
and
spring
drinkability
well
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
drink
more
than
three
of
these
if
only
for
the
fact
that
walking
would
be
slightly
difficult
afterwords
i
am
currently
halfway
through
one
and
the
feeling
in
my
throat
is
starting
to
remind
of
the
days
when
i
drank
scotch
on
a
regular
basis
i
will
say
that
this
is
a
prime
example
of
a
helles
on
steroids
it
is
much
boozier
and
certainly
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
would
expect
of
an
helles
but
other
than
that
it
does
remain
truetoform
so
well
as
i
know
the
style
and
if
half
of
one
didnt
make
me
as
tipsy
as
this
one
has
i
would
really
be
in
the
mindset
of
drinking
a
few
of
these
last
brewed
in
1986
i
hope
they
keep
release
this
beer
yearly
from
now
on
ok
so
i
saw
this
one
on
the
shelf
and
was
a
little
curious
at
first
i
by
passed
it
as
it
looked
the
same
as
a
regular
but
then
noticed
it
was
a
special
edition
so
i
had
to
pick
one
up
it
poured
a
nice
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
smallish
head
that
faded
quickly
the
aroma
was
full
of
malt
and
grass
like
smells
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
but
that
is
to
be
expected
the
flavor
was
much
sweeter
then
i
thought
it
would
be
with
a
nice
rounded
caramel
tone
a
good
amount
of
brandy
like
alcohol
thrown
in
some
bready
and
cereal
like
malt
base
making
up
the
rest
with
a
sweet
sugary
finish
that
was
sprikled
with
a
touch
of
floralness
overall
this
was
a
good
bit
different
then
the
normal
seemed
to
be
a
bit
sweeter
defintly
lighter
looking
and
a
touch
hotter
with
the
alcohol
very
intresting
find
and
will
have
to
go
back
to
the
store
and
grab
a
couple
more
fwarm
sweet
and
coats
like
a
liqueur
well
overall
for
me
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
it
is
a
unique
experience
but
the
ridiculous
sweetness
will
probably
keep
me
from
coming
back
frequently
certainly
something
i
want
to
explore
again
overall
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
its
a
real
nice
strong
sipper
with
some
table
wine
and
brandylike
qualities
not
so
sure
about
the
doppelbock
classification
but
frankly
i
dont
care
what
its
called
its
good
for
what
its
worth
it
paired
surprisingly
well
with
a
bacon
and
red
onion
pizza
i
dont
think
id
ever
pony
up
for
it
at
full
price
but
i
will
keep
an
eye
out
for
reasonable
deals
on
this
one
whiskey
taste
mixed
with
kind
of
liqorish
chocolate
too
sweet
for
my
taste
its
absolutely
not
what
i
am
loking
for
in
a
beer
wont
try
it
ever
again
place
holder
review
i
will
get
a
few
more
and
review
it
very
strangenot
sure
what
will
appeal
to
all
but
definitely
worth
a
try
bottled
in
2010
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
sweet
smells
like
the
style
dopplebock
good
beer
fruity
and
winey
theres
a
bit
of
a
cough
syrup
thing
happening
here
sadly
im
not
so
sure
im
into
this
one
maybe
im
not
being
fair
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
doppelbocks
but
i
know
what
i
like
and
i
feel
like
this
was
wasted
on
me
i
had
a
couple
of
bottles
years
back
from
a
now
defunct
local
gourmet
grocery
absolutely
amazing
smooth
and
sweet
smell
and
taste
very
fruity
with
too
many
flavors
to
remember
just
like
a
good
port
wine
or
brandy
a
beer
liqueur
you
need
to
sip
slowly
with
rich
dark
chocolates
on
a
plate
i
dont
usually
like
sweet
brews
but
once
a
year
this
is
a
treat
from
taste
notes
appearance
pours
brilliant
dark
amber
to
chestnut
with
a
thin
film
of
white
fizzley
foam
for
a
head
smell
dark
dried
fruit
and
sherry
to
port
aromas
leather
not
much
malt
no
roast
not
much
hop
but
some
alcohol
taste
starts
with
a
blast
of
fruit
some
sweet
dark
cherry
then
it
seques
through
some
sherry
flavors
sweetened
with
caramel
and
spiced
with
a
trace
of
cinnamon
it
presents
a
hot
alcohol
warming
finish
mouthfeel
a
shade
less
than
chewy
its
less
than
average
carbonation
levels
suggest
a
port
wine
texture
overall
this
is
sweet
and
alcoholic
like
a
sweet
wine
with
some
malt
flavors
running
around
and
leaves
a
burst
of
alcohol
in
the
back
taste
a
classic
holiday
sitting
by
the
fire
beer
smooth
and
sweet
doppelbock
heaven
im
very
impressed
with
this
one
i
was
smitten
with
this
beer
from
the
first
sip
highlighted
taste
and
high
alcohol
level
make
it
very
tasty
paired
very
nicely
with
dark
chocolate
yes
a
lot
of
sweet
caramel
notes
but
a
lot
of
interesting
dried
fruity
character
mixed
with
spices
and
oak
it
never
became
cloying
had
it
at
nearly
room
temperature
though
and
was
a
smoothly
satisfying
i
dont
think
you
can
take
knocks
at
this
beer
for
being
what
it
is
meant
to
be
it
is
utterly
delicious
a
smooth
sipper
and
warming
it
may
not
be
to
everyones
taste
but
it
makes
a
nice
treat
sweet
dates
and
raisins
high
gravity
and
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
would
love
it
hopped
up
o
although
balanced
this
doppelbock
is
far
too
much
to
enjoy
its
not
warming
just
intoxicating
the
flavor
is
simple
and
straight
to
the
point
there
is
nothing
clean
about
this
recipe
far
too
sweet
for
my
liking
it
couldve
been
a
lot
more
balanced
alcohol
is
well
hidden
though
taste
good
actually
but
you
can
feel
how
strong
it
is
dark
amber
color
raisiny
aroma
robust
taste
almost
like
that
of
a
barleywine
heavy
on
the
pallet
overall
a
truly
gorgeous
looking
beer
and
way
too
drinkable
for
14
would
love
to
taste
it
again
with
some
age
on
it
definitely
a
beer
i
need
to
reevaluate
when
i
have
an
opportunity
to
taste
a
cellared
version
definitely
a
winter
beer
if
there
ever
was
one
its
heavy
on
the
sweetness
and
fruit
typical
of
strong
barleywines
a
little
boozy
but
its
all
balanced
very
well
and
it
put
a
smile
on
my
face
at
how
unique
a
delicious
it
was
im
buying
more
when
i
find
them
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
pretty
much
all
the
aspects
that
i
expect
from
the
a
very
strong
doppelbock
and
it
was
just
the
type
of
beer
i
needed
on
this
really
cold
day
in
mid
michigan
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
a
little
smooth
not
crisp
a
little
boozy
a
little
warming
pretty
sticky
slightly
cloying
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
one
is
the
perfect
amount
for
me
no
need
to
open
another
one
and
i
think
it
makes
for
a
great
cold
weather
beer
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
color
and
the
balance
when
it
came
to
the
taste
to
me
those
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
like
the
lest
about
this
beer
was
the
sweetness
and
how
well
the
alcohol
was
hidden
i
think
those
aspects
could
use
a
little
bit
of
work
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
ill
be
getting
a
bottle
next
year
and
i
think
i
might
have
to
get
one
or
two
for
the
cellar
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
strong
doppelbocks
its
very
true
to
style
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
and
i
think
it
was
a
good
idea
to
revisit
it
it
is
strong
and
boozy
but
the
flavors
are
good
and
i
think
its
a
good
winter
seasonal
it
makes
for
a
good
first
impression
for
this
brewery
and
i
would
like
to
try
more
of
their
beers
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
high
gravity
doppelbocks
ive
had
good
job
guys
this
is
one
tasty
and
potent
doppelbock
keep
up
the
solid
work
this
was
simply
an
amazing
beer
it
taste
of
toffee
but
not
too
strong
you
can
hardly
taste
the
alcohol
in
it
its
thick
and
rich
this
is
one
you
would
drink
after
a
meal
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
dessert
drink
goes
with
chocolate
very
well
indeed
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
tasted
it
deserves
a
higher
rating
than
its
been
given
o
havent
had
this
in
years
and
im
glad
i
finally
revisited
it
a
great
sipper
that
hasnt
lost
its
edge
even
in
the
new
era
of
extreme
high
gravity
beers
that
have
surpassed
this
what
was
once
the
strongest
beer
in
the
world
o
i
think
this
deserves
a
much
higher
rating
a
very
special
beer
that
i
will
buy
more
of
now
and
in
years
to
come
got
to
try
the
2007
on
new
years
eve
pours
an
amber
color
with
very
little
head
to
speak
of
the
smell
was
full
of
caramel
and
toffee
but
also
oak
and
what
smelled
like
port
wine
the
taste
wasnt
as
sweet
when
i
tried
my
first
sip
very
complex
and
layered
with
different
flavors
sweet
but
not
sugary
bold
but
not
overpowering
very
nice
when
you
get
one
of
these
let
it
set
in
the
wine
cellar
for
a
couple
of
years
the
flavors
become
much
more
complex
if
you
enjoy
a
quad
but
havent
ever
tried
this
do
not
wait
any
longer
get
this
now
nice
reddishamber
no
head
to
speak
of
very
fruitforwards
figs
rasins
chocolate
over
a
nice
malty
base
a
bit
syrupy
but
otherwise
nice
carbonation
and
smooth
nice
heat
vintage
2010
this
is
my
first
go
at
this
one
have
heard
some
mixed
reviews
but
i
really
enjoyed
a
bit
boozy
sweet
but
not
overly
so
feel
is
smooth
and
creamy
light
carbonation
reminds
me
a
lot
of
eggnog
for
some
reason
which
is
a
holiday
favorite
of
mine
really
enjoyed
sipping
this
one
as
a
nightcap
on
christmas
eve
this
beer
tastes
like
grass
imo
this
review
is
from
a
couple
years
ago
this
vintage
beer
2007
was
the
grande
finale
of
an
event
i
held
at
14
the
front
label
says
it
all
the
strongest
lager
beer
in
the
world
at
five
years
old
we
were
getting
this
beer
at
its
peak
having
mellowed
out
the
high
alcohol
to
bring
the
sweet
maltiness
to
the
forefront
a
lot
of
comments
were
this
is
similar
to
a
port
and
this
would
be
a
great
dessert
beer
that
would
go
great
with
cheesecake
i
still
have
a
half
dozen
bottles
that
im
letting
age
and
opening
on
dec
6
of
every
year
this
year
i
cracked
the
next
one
open
and
it
aged
even
better
becoming
a
little
more
port
like
a
nice
slow
sipper
and
if
you
know
what
youre
getting
into
its
a
nice
dessertish
beer
definitely
not
for
all
but
try
it
for
yourselves
ottima

buona

corposa
2011
great
beer
pours
dark
and
thick
lots
of
coffee
and
malt
this
one
is
hard
to
review
the
first
sips
are
world
class
4
6
on
the
first
pass
but
after
10
ounces
or
so
over
45
minutes
the
sweetness
becomes
a
bit
annoying
and
i
have
the
750
bottle
so
in
goes
a
wine
cap
and
back
in
the
fridge
this
one
goes
lager
meets
sweetened
spiced
wine
a
good
thing
to
have
in
small
amounts
a
couple
times
a
year
not
sure
i
would
want
more
than
a
little
at
a
time
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
brew
but
its
not
nearly
my
favorite
fresh
it
seems
to
be
a
syrupy
candylike
lowcarbed
wine
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
too
i
guess
this
doesnt
make
it
bad
at
all
just
very
average
may
not
be
everyones
cup
of
joe
but
the
sweetness
and
high
alcohol
just
mean
its
a
sipper
classic
holiday
beer
3
45
upanddown
but
still
a
fun
drink
the
overall
just
one
of
the
finest
doublebocks
you
will
ever
enjoy
bleh
way
too
sweet
and
syrup
like
i
will
never
buy
this
one
again
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
i
figured
it
would
be
exceptionally
harsh
but
it
is
not
it
is
however
super
sweet
i
can
hear
my
teeth
rotting
heavy
and
thick
with
sharp
alcohol
leads
to
notsogreat
drinkability
this
is
certainly
a
sipper
a
good
sipper
though
not
too
harsh
not
too
over
the
top
11
2
ounces
is
just
right
anymore
would
be
hard
to
handle
i
appreciate
the
high
percentage
but
too
sweet
purchased
in
villach
at
eurospar
the
bottle
i
had
was
aged
5
years
i
imagine
fresher
bottles
might
be
a
little
rough
pours
a
rich
clear
deep
amber
with
a
frothy
lingering
khaki
head
i
can
smell
melanoidins
and
deeply
toasted
malt
across
the
room
dark
fruit
notes
of
raisins
dates
prunes
figs
and
bruised
cherries
add
complexity
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
with
a
toasted
malt
and
fruity
specialty
malt
backbone
the
finish
is
surprisingly
dry
and
toasted
boozy
rumsoaked
figs
raisins
and
dates
provide
fuel
for
the
syrupy
sweetness
could
use
some
age
to
develop
those
esters
a
bit
and
calm
the
alcohol
its
definitely
for
those
with
a
sweet
tooth
i
really
wanted
to
love
this
but
its
just
too
sweet
o
the
english
barleywine
of
doppelbocks
syrupy
sweet
but
pleasant
throughout
this
would
be
a
great
dessert
beer
very
palatable
good
lord
its
too
sweet
alcohol
is
not
hidden
either
2012
vintage
pours
a
beautiful
amber
red
with
a
small
offwhite
head
medium
to
high
carbonation
the
nose
hits
you
with
dark
fruit
and
bready
notes
the
taste
follows
the
nose
but
is
extremely
sweet
with
some
vanilla
that
rounds
off
the
dark
fruits
caramel
malt
and
alcohol
reminds
me
of
a
sweet
alcohol
syrup
i
can
only
imagine
having
this
with
a
meal
or
a
substantial
dessert
it
finishes
slightly
dry
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
very
sweet
and
bready
despite
the
higher
alcohol

a

to

heavy

which
is

by

quite
a
remarkable
ale
the
doppelbock
is
there
but
on
steroids
so
sweet
and
syrupy
it
seems
like
it
should
be
cloying
but
the
sweetness
and
alchohol
are
melded
into
the
great
malt
and
fruit
flavors
almost
like
the
apertif

of
a

not
for
the
sweet
adverse
but
a
great
dessert
beer
and
pleasant
late
evening
drink
deserves
its
classic
name
and
reputation
this
beer
is
truly
a
quaffable
drinkable
glass
of
liquid
diabetes
its
very
good
but
very
potent
and
the
intense
sweetness
is
sure
to
turn
some
people
off
would
make
a
good
sipper
over
a
good
long
hour
or
more
omg
this
is
good
o
interesting
beer
extremely
flavorful
not
a
text
book
example
of
a
doppelbock
but
fun
to
try
much
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
o
absolutely
delicious
a
must
have
my
ratings
are
loosely
based
on
memory
as
i
was
in
neither
the
mindset
nor
setting
for
a
proper
tasting
however
i
will
say
this
this
beer
knocks
you
out
in
the
caliber
of
the
craft
and
abv
i
had
it
for
breakfast
while
visiting
spain
hardly
appreciating
its
beauty
what
i
would
give
to
try
this
again
correctly
dont
pass
up
an
opportunity
to
enjoy
this
strong
nose
and
on
the
palate
bam
this
is
a
big
syrupy
caramelly
honeyraisinrummy
silky
doppelbock
its
a
very
powerful
taste
and
mouthfeel
definitely
a
dessert
beer
because
this
would
be
hard
to
follow
o
at
6
50
a
bottle
id
call
this
the
bargain
of
the
century
youll
never
find
a
more
perfect
embodiment
of
what
a
doppelbock
can
be
the
austrians
have
come
up
with
one
amazing
beer
if
i
ever
see
this
again
i
will
most
certainly
buy
it
again
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
has
ever
tasted
beer
simply
amazing
cold
bottled
syrup
consistency
similar
to
blackberry
juice
tick
but
not
creamy
malt
dried
fruit
caramel
oak
tree
and
some
smoke
in
smell
and
taste
honey
and
rum
at
the
end
dark
and
heavy
ideal
for
dark
chocolate
and
beer
chocolate
cake
not
too
sweet
nor
too
dry
cigars
apples
rye
and
more
to
be
found
o
cant
believe
this
beer
is
14
if
you
love
belgian
quads
and
strong
dark
ales
then
this
is
a
must
this
beer
might
be
a
tad
too
sweet
for
some
but
i
appreciate
the
complexity
of
sweet
flavours
that
exhibit
great
balance
and
finish
o
this
beer
is
smooth
with
nice
flavor
development
i
get
a
warming
sensation
from
the
high
abv
i
should
sleep

overalll
i
recalled
the
experience
of

this
in
russells
almost
two
decades

and
i
knew
this

would
reveal
my
inability
to
enjoy
the
finer
more
precious
things
in

complex
enough
to
be
cellared

sipped
unique
enough
to
be
an

taste
i
cannot

have
an

my

at

from

the
beer
grows
in
its
attractiveness
as
the
glass
drains
but
the
fullbodied
nature
demands
something
intense
as
a
pairing
like
a
rich
chocolate
cake
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
incredibly
balanced
and
tons
of
complexity
im
looking
forward
to
grabbing
one
to
see
how
it
ages
definitely
would
recommend
the
label
reads
malt
liquor
for
a
reason
as
this
is
a
straight
malt
bomb
it
starts
with
strong
chocolate
malt
but
settles
into
a
dark
fruit
fig
prune
and
raisin
it
finishes
with
a
strong
alcohol
brashness
in
flavor
and
feel
overall
its
pretty
good
and
fairly
varied
but
14
pct
abv
is
forever
evident
overall
i
respect
the
style
of
this
beer
and
understand
its
significance
however
i
do
not
need
to
drink
it
again
the
thick
aroma
and
flavor
calls
for
a
very
small
pour
it
is
an
attractive
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
recommend
for
a
social
event
it
is
for
a
late
evening
of
sipping
thinking
reading
and
writing
the
high
abv
has
a
very
calming
and
warming
effect
o
first
time
having
this
beer
and
definitely
enjoyed
it
the
resemblance
to
a
well
made
cocktail
in
both
flavor
and
texture
was
uncanny
definitely
a
sipper
but
something
ill
be
reaching
for
again
next
year
i
love
high
abv
beers
i
have
an
open
mind
and
i
love
everything
about
the
brewing
craft
but
this
thing
candycoated
cigarette
ash
that
has
been
doused
in
bottom
shelf
bourbon
holy
hell
i
havent
had
a
beer
this
bad
in
a
long
time
gives
me
the
haunted
shivers
i
got
when
i
tried
a
sip
of
bud
light
chelada
whoever
you
are
that
brewed
this
batch
or
beer
in
general
there
is
a
special
spot
in
hell
for
you
right
next
to
the
chelada
guy
o
super
sweet
and
definitely
a
sipper
but
the
sweetness
does
not
overpower
great
sweet
bread
flavors
that
one
would
expect
from
a
doppelbock
id
love
to
get
another
bottle
to
see
what
some
age
does
for
it
but
it
drinks
just
fine
fresh
o
an
expertly
crafted
dopplebock
and
one
id
love
to
try
fresh
to
compare
the
flavors
to
the
aged
bottle
i
had
absolutely
delightful
o
this
is
a
classic
im
going
to
buy
one
and
age
it
to
see
how
it
does
this
bottle
i
drank
is
fresh
with
the
age
at
hand
this
isnt
difficult
to
drink
at
all
the
amount
served
to
me
was
perfect
but
i
could
easily
split
a
bottle
of
this
i
used
to
hear
divided
things
about
this
that
it
was
too
sweet
too
boozy
and
pricey
for
the
effort
required
to
finish
it
i
say
give
it
some
time
let
it
mellow
out
over
a
decade
maybe
even
two
youll
find
yourself
in
the
end
with
one
of
the
most
fantastic
elixirs
in
the
beer
world
bar
none
i
wish
i
had
more
bottles
of
this
vintage
to
age
for
the
next
decade
but
alas
ill
have
to
dig
deeper
to
find
more
if
you
can
find
a
bottle
thats
at
least
810
years
old
dont
miss
out
the
chance
to
try
this
overall
a
good
beer
definitly
not
for
everyday
o
not
complex
at
all
but
still
delicious
elementary
you
might
say
cough
medicinelike
syrup
with
shit
loads
of
alcohol
whats
not
to
like
overall
not
my
favorite
but
id
love
to
try
this
aged
always
worth
a
try
even
with
a
steep
import
price
go
get
it
a
very
sweet
and
tasty
beer
the
roundness
of
this
beer
is
very
impressive
the
heavy
alcohol
works
perfectly
with
no
astringency
looks
great
in
a
glass
as
well
i
have
never
had
anything
like
this
perfect
overall
fat
and
very
sweet
never
was
a
fan
of
these
two
but
its
definitely
an
interesting
beer
just
not
my
style
would
recommend
to
try
it
if
your
into
sweet
shit
youll
probably
love
it
unmistakeably
a
work
of
genius
a
decadent
beer
even
though
its
on
the
sugary
side
it
could
be
more
dry
appropriate
beer
for
the
sugar
bowl
go
mizzou
backend
feel
is
a
bit
too
weird
for
me
to
give
monumental
rating
its
good
and
recommended
just
with
a
grain
of
salt
overall
this
is
amazing
words
dont
do
it
justice
its
easy
to
drink
but
be
careful
i
can
feel
the
alcohol
kicing
in
after
just
one
o
my
experience
with
dopplebocks
is
pretty
limited
but
i
can
say
that
those
i
have
tried
were
a
little
less
full
and
potent
than
this
beer
i
enjoyed
samichlaus
and
i
think
that
as
others
have
noted
it
may
need
more
age
on
it
to
soften
it
i
will
try
this
again
final
grade
4
31
an
a
samichlaus
classic
is
by
far
the
best
austrian
beer
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
so
far
as
well
as
one
of
the
most
unique
brews
to
grace
my
glass
in
a
long
time
this
one
isnt
for
the
faint
of
heart
and
if
malty
boozy
monsters
arent
up
your
alley
i
cant
see
it
being
worth
your
time
as
for
me
this
is
a
nice
changeup
from
the
usual
fare
and
it
makes
a
fantastic
winter
warmer
glad
i
picked
up
another
bottle
to
cellar
for
a
few
years
since
that
seems
to
be
the
preferred
way
to
handle
this
stuff
further
edit
some
say
this
has
to
be
aged
for
at
least
2
years
and
then
its
true
power
is
revealed
to
that
i
say
why
release
it
if
its
undrinkable
asis
they
already
aged
it
for
10
months
before
bottling
or
whatever
if
it
needs
two
more
years
to
not
be
horrible
why
not
hang
on
to
it
for
that
long
and
then
send
it
to
stores
o
unreal
is
an
understatement
this
brew
is
in
a
realm
of
its
own
even
though
its
a
labeled
as
a
doppelbock
it
reveals
itself
to
be
so
much
more
than
that
the
tradition
of
this
brew
dating
back
to
the
1970s
and
also
being
brewed
once
a
year
on
december
6th
has
an
alluring
quality
that
might
form
a
bias
for
most
but
this
beer
is
big
and
for
real
dont
miss
out
on
this
beer
if
you
see
it
at
your
local
beer
shop
my
expectations
may
have
been
too
high
but
not
the
dignified
classic
i
expected
overall
i
cant
describe
this
beer
in
any
good
way
smells
of
sweetness
tastes
too
sweet
over
cloyingly
sweetness
overwhelms
anything
that
could
have
been
overall
enjoyable
after
dinner
sipper
for
sure
that
keeps
you
warm
on
a
cold
winter
day
would
probably
be
okay
splitting
this
with
someone
overall
it
very
sweet
and
syrupy
and
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
more
if
the
bottle
was
maybe
5
oz
and
not
11
2
it
is
like
desert
in
a
glass
o
had
always
passed
on
this
beer
but
finally
choose
this
one
tonight
im
pretty
disappointed
in
this
one
it
is
just
way
too
sweet
overall
definitely
heated
up
my
gut
mouthfeel
was
full
and
pleasant
but
i
could
not
get
past
the
cloyingly
sweet
finish
with
a
lingering
aftertaste
that
i
found
highly
unpleasant
to
each
his
own
but
im
not
impressed
4
755
would
drink
again
this
one
is
ia
bit
too
sweet
for
me
although
the
prominent
alcohol
heat
warmed
me
up
quickly
and
helped
me
forget
some
of
its
less
appealing
aspects
always
up
for
trying
huge
beers
but
find
many
times
there
are
too
many
tradeoffs
in
the
balance
department
this
is
an
intriguing
beer
and
one
that
everyone
should
try
at
least
once
i
wish
i
could
have
done
a
vertical
because
honestly
i
think
this
would
be
better
with
a
little
more
alcohol
heat
this
is
so
mellow
at
this
stage
in
the
game
its
too
onedimensional
samichlaus
was
revolutionary
two
decades
ago
in
america
but
at
this
point
we
have
surpassed
it
by
strides
drink
this
next
to
something
like
sucaba
and
you
will
probably
agree
i
get
that
one
is
a
high
gravity
lager
and
the
other
an
american
take
on
an
english
barleywine
but
the
flavor
profiles
are
pretty
similar
this
even
looks
like
a
barleywine
i
cant
believe
how
much
i
flipped
my
lid
over
this
all
those
years
ago
overall
pretty
good
beer
i
fully
understand
the
polarization
that
this
beer
causes
this
is
not
a
beer
for
the
novice
or
anyone
who
likes
lighter
styles
this
is
not
a
beer
that
you
should
really
drink
more
than
one
of
i
would
love
to
see
what
aging
will
produce
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
like
big
bold
malty
beers
in
the
naked
pint
and
rich
complex
of
sweet
flavors
that
hit
rum

so
we
wouldnt

kids
to
want
to
buy
this
expensive
beer
and
one
that
will
warm
you
up
due
to
the
high
abv
but
the
cherry
sweetness
is
overwhelming
bottled
in
2008
consumed
on

this
is
by
far
the
highest
abv
beer
ive
ever
had
in
my
cellar
is
another
bottle
from
2003
drinkability
a
definite
sipper
another
fine
example
of
a
sherry
type
beer
after
having
christmas
dinner
i
chose
this
as
my
christmas
desert
beer
served
cellar
temperature
to
unleash
the
flavors
im
not
disappointed
merry
christmas
drinkability
this
is
a
great
beverage
to
celebrate
special
occasions
abv
makes
this
a
sipper
for
sure
price
makes
it
not
feasible
to
drink
often
but
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
i
will
revisit
in
the
future
its
probably
for
the
better
that
samichlaus
is
brewed
only
one
day
a
year
that
and
the
fact
that
its
brewed
in
a
castle
and
virtually
everything
else
about
the
beer
is
entirely
enchanting
it
is
indeed
a
special
beer
for
a
special
time
of
year
and
like
st
nikolaus
himself
its
sure
to
have
you
saying
happy
christmas
to
all
and
to
all
a
goodnight
cheers
d
great
beer
as
advertised
does
age
well
and
presents
the
flavors
one
would
expect
have
had
fresh
and
this
beer
is
too
much
fresh
but
if
allowed
to
sit
you
get
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
the
wait
clear
dark
copperred
almost
brown
very
small
head
and
no
lacing
sharp
alcohol
smell
accompanies
sweet
syrupy
malts
over
a
dark
fruit
base
alcohol
is
a
little
less
dominant
in
the
taste
which
features
the
sweet
dark
fruits
and
caramel
malt
and
toffee
texture
is
amazing
creamy
smooth
even
with
all
that
alcohol
thick
rich
and
chewy
sweet
finish
without
being
cloying
and
oh
yeah
the
slight
alcohol
burn
this
was
a
2009
i
will
let
my
other
one
sit
at
least
a
year
it
was
evident
as
the
tasting
went
slowly
on
that
i
was
drinking
something
very
special
the
flavors
and
aroma
were
intensified
by
the
high
alcohol
content
this
libation
was
not
brewed
to
slake
ones
thirst
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
wash
down
a
spicy
meal
but
is
a
worthy
showcase
for
the
art
of
a
brewery
that
has
been
around
for
over
400
years
at
1
u
s
dollar
an
ounce
i
did
not
at
all
mind
taking
my
time
with
this
unique
creation
d
moderately
drinkable
very
tasty
but
not
worthy
of
an
entire
drinking
session
this
annual
holiday
brew
can
be
a
nice
afterdinner
aperitif
with
some
warm
plum
pudding
or
berrystuffed
cinnamon
baked
apples
dressed
in
ginger
cream
d
very
drinkable
dont
even
notice
the
alcohol
this
was
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
i
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
luckily
for
me
it
was
an
aged
draft
and
it
was
great
enough
then
to
get
me
started
down
the
path
to
craft
beer
i
love
this
stuff
and
am
sorry
that
i
came
home
from
my
beer
buying
trek
with
only
one
of
these
d
best
in
small
quantities
half
a
bottle
is
more
than
enough
two
or
three
ounces
would
have
been
sufficient
this
beer
pours
a
copper
color
with
little
to
no
head
to
speak
of
but
at
this
abv
its
understandable
the
smell
is
strong
there
are
lots
of
caramel
notes
perhaps
some
butterscotch
thrown
in
with
all
of
the
booze
fumes
that
are
creeping
up
my
nostrils
there
is
caramel
and
toffee
in
the
flavor
as
well
but
mostly
this
is
just
a
sugary
butterscotch
candy
though
due
to
the
high
powered
booze
that
exists
you
could
say
there
is
a
bit
more
scotch
than
butter
however
it
doesnt
take
away
from
the
fact
that
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
really
sugary
for
any
style
and
as
for
a
doppelbock
im
not
really
sure
if
it
qualifies
in
that
realm
either
but
no
matter
the
style
please
be
sure
to
sip
this
beer
its
a
doozie
as
noted
i
enjoyed
this
beer
while
shopping
for
2
seasonals
from
terrapin
brewery
d
for
a
14
beer
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
very
enjoyable
its
so
rich
and
flavourful
and
yet
has
those
refreshing
lager
characteristics
drinkability
a
hesitate
to
give
a
5
but
this
guy
is
just
too
smooth
for
such
a
monster
the
aging
has
done
this
wonders
absolutely
no
trace
of
the
huge
14
abv
and
the
flavors
are
meddled
nicely
d
this
is
an
obvious
sipper
at
14
alcohol
is
rather
present
nice
and
complex
worth
trying
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
from
the
boozy
qualities
but
it
is
very
good
overall
however
this
was
quite
different
in
flavor
from
any
doppelbock
ive
had
before
this
should
have
come
in
an
8oz
bottle
not
a
750ml
i
cant
imagine
anyone
being
able
to
finish
this
its
like
very
very
bad
cough
syrup
this
is
the
75cl
limited
edition
bottled
2009
pours
with
more
fizz
than
i
expected
and
is
a
clear
burnished
copper
with
very
minimal
head
retention
the
smell
hits
me
before
im
anywhere
near
the
glass
with
a
noticable
alcohol
whiff
followed
by
cherries
caramel
and
fruit
that
makes
my
mouth
water
the
taste
is
intensely
sweet
and
just
gets
sweeter
towards
the
finish
pronounced
caramel
and
toffee
tastes
underpinned
by
a
raisinlike
taste
that
tries
to
dry
things
out
a
bit
it
will
take
a
lot
more
sun
after
a
downpour
like
that
the
finish
is
where
the
alcohol
becomes
very
apparent
it
is
a
bit
warm
going
down
mouthfeel
is
again
more
carbonated
than
i
thought
for
such
a
huge
beer
slick
and
syrupy
all
at
once
it
coats
your
tongue
long
after
it
has
left
your
mouth
drinkability
is
not
bad
but
you
have
to
expect
to
be
so
challenged
by
the
sweetness
and
the
abv
that
you
just
cant
really
call
this
very
drinkable
but
good
great
even
oh
yes
you
can
call
it
that
this
is
a
very
sweet
and
sticky
dopplebock
upon
first
sip
but
it
mellows
out
nicely
and
while
the
14
abv
is
noticeable
if
you
just
sip
it
on
a
quiet
winters
night
its
smooth
and
warming
all
over
a
good
beer
to
share
but
if
curiosity
gets
the
better
of
you
like
it
does
me
give
it
a
shot
but
enjoy
it
slowly
definitely
now
one
of
my
faves
in
the
category
ill
be
coming
back
to
this
love
the
taste
only
thing
preventing
more
than
one
is
the
high
abv
cheers
d
in
a
2
oz
sample
this
would
be
interesting
at
11
2
this
is
way
too
much
for
a
single
sitting
d
for
a
beer
at
14
abv
this
stuff
is
way
to
drinkable
the
taste
is
damn
good
this
is
a
beer
that
every
ba
should
try
sometime
d
14
is
well
hidden
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
it
gets
better
and
better
as
it
warms
up
highly
recommended
the
alcohol
taste
brings
this
down
one
notch
from
perfect
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
and
split
very
thick
reddish
brown
with
little
head
smells
a
bit
like
cherry
with
alcohol
notes
the
scent
itself
is
intoxicating
tastes
is
very
woody
and
boozy
with
this
slight
tartness
in
the
background
it
is
a
bit
hard
to
get
down
at
first
but
as
this
beer
warms
up
you
warm
up
and
end
up
enjoying
this
a
lot
but
it
is
still
a
tough
beast
to
break
d
dangerously
drinkable
the
14
can
be
felt
but
not
tasted
samichlaus
is
very
sweet
which
may
detract
for
some
but
not
me
highly
recommended
my
friend
commented
wow
this
tastes
like
it
would
make
inlaws
tolerable
d
medium
quite
sweet
and
strong
beer
to
be
appreciated
with
moderation
overall
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
this
style
but
this
is
nothing
like
other
examples
of
the
style
i
have
had
to
me
this
drank
more
like
an
english
barleywine
still
its
very
interesting
and
a
good
beer
drinkability
is
tough
to
gauge
here
at
14
you
have
to
sip
this
one
and
you
really
should
i
drank
this
glass
over
the
course
of
2
hours
sip
sip
sip
it
was
the
best
route
and
i
didnt
get
kicked
in
the
head
by
the
abv
i
also
got
the
most
out
of
the
flavor
of
the
brew
if
you
are
in
the
mood
to
do
some
tastings
this
is
not
a
brew
to
combine
with
others
well
worth
trying
d
this
is
too
sweet
and
boozy
it
is
definitely
a
sipper
and
only
that
if
its
cold
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
mediumlow
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
considering
the
staggering
abv
i
just
had
to
spell
and
respell
considering
several
times
however
with
its
sweetness
this
cant
be
considered
too
drinkable
a
beer
imo
recommended
especially
to
malt
lovers
all
in
all
the
final
score
doesnt
do
justice
to
this
beer
the
flavor
is
so
complex
that
it
more
than
makes
up
for
the
deficiencies
in
the
other
categories
expensive
but
well
worth
the
money
for
me
this
is
a
big
and
bold
beer
obviously
with
its
massive
alcohol
level
here
i
think
the
alcohol
works
well
with
the
sweet
wichness
of
the
brew
but
the
experience
is
along
the
lines
of
port
wine
i
good
beer
to
sip
and
nibble
chocolates
with
d
high
quality
beer
but
the
aftertaste
is
not
my
thing
it
is
very
easy
to
get
drunk
on
this
so
be
careful
bottled
in
2008
so
according
to
the
bottle
it
would
have
been
brewed
in
dec
6
2007
this
beer
ages
10
months
before
being
bottled
poured
into
a
mini
snifter
dark
burgandy
color
with
little
whispy
head
that
quickly
disappears
some
scents
of
candied
malts
and
aged
fruits
the
bottle
says
its
a
malt
liquor
but
it
smells
a
lot
like
a
barleywine
ale
mouthfeel
is
smooth
not
heavy
mostly
tastes
of
sweet
malts
no
real
hop
profile
alcohol
is
certainly
warming
as
i
drink
it
down
i
gonna
sip
on
this
one
for
a
while
outstanding
overall
i
am
pairing
this
nicely
with
some
fresh
pairs
and
aged
provolone
cheese
4
5
d
this
is
a
sipper
but
it
isnt
a
bad
one
though
the
appearance
and
nose
arent
that
impressive
the
taste
is
solid
i
imagine
this
would
be
even
better
with
some
more
age
on
it
db
reminds
me
of
jw
lees
vintages
but
at
the
same
time
has
a
unique
flavor
i
guess
the
old
german
flavors
lend
a
rum
almost
olive
like
aspect
even
oily
very
interesting
wouldnt
mind
letting
a
four
pack
age
for
ever
medium
to
low
carbonation
with
an
oily
feel
on
the
tongue
a
very
well
crafted
doppelbock
verdict
a
truly
extraordinary
christmas
beer
and
definitely
a
beer
to
try
for
an
enthusiast
samichlaus
takes
the
ideas
of
a
conventional
beer
and
turns
it
into
a
very
unique
and
distinctive
beverage
drink
for
such
an
ostensibly
heavy
beer
it
has
incredible
drink
ability
it
is
hardy
yet
some
how
not
filling
but
maybe
thats
because
it
is
14
alcohol
so
you
dont
need
many
before
it
is
time
to
call
it
a
night
m
syrupy
mild
carbonation
probably
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
true
doppelbock
from
the
southeastern
alps
d
id
be
great
having
one
every
night
in
the
winter
overall
an
interesting
beer
the
alcohol
is
apparent
but
surprisingly
not
overwhelming
for
me
it
is
a
bit
too
cloyingly
sweet
for
me
would
make
for
a
good
after
dinner
sipper
thanks
solan
i
would
take
mr
jacksons
professional
advice
and
enjoy
it
with
flourless
chocolate
cake
heavy
chocolate
mouse
or
any
other
dense
chocolate
dessert
beyond
that
have
it
alone
somewhere
comfortable
with
friends
without
distractions
and
when
you
have
plenty
of
time
to
enjoy
it
this
beer
is
worth
the
effort
consider
the
effort
but
into
it
it
will
really
only
continue
to
improve
with
age
so
dont
be
shy
about
storing
several
bottles
just
be
sure
they
are
in
a
cool
dark
place
i
see
no
end
in
sight
for
this
remarkable
beer
besides
my
stomach
mf
is
buttery
and
a
little
bit
syrupy
with
a
slight
dryness
in
the
finish
its
a
sipper
of
epic
proportions
tons
of
very
obvious
alcohol
this
is
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
at
length
the
appearance
was
a
great
thick
looking
dark
brown
it
almost
seemed
to
pour
like
it
was
caramel
the
taste
fit
in
with
the
caramel
description
it
was
thick
malty
and
delicous
i
am
glad
there
arent
too
many
7
year
old
sammies
around
or
this
would
be
a
dangerous
beer
i
was
dreading
the
end
of
the
glass
d
gorgeous
to
sip
on
but
difficult
to
finish
more
than
half
the
bottle
this
beer
is
to
be
enjoyed
like
a
fine
scotch
sipped
slowly
to
enjoy
the
complexities
it
is
bursting
with
taste
and
absolutely
fantastic
to
drink
ive
had
plenty
of
good
barley
wines
and
stock
ales
and
this
one
is
a
fantastic
example
of
both
its
called
a
doppelbock
but
it
tastes
more
like
a
barley
wine
or
a
stock
ale
than
anything
at
14
this
is
a
very
warm
beer
it
has
a
nice
buttery
toffee
aftertaste
this
bottle
is
from
2009
but
i
know
this
would
be
an
amazing
beer
to
age
d
love
to
drink
this
again
but
boy
is
it
a
sipper
id
say
that
this
is
by
far
the
strongestmost
intense
beer
ive
had
to
date
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
if
you
can
get
it
try
it
but
be
prepared
f
still
very
sweet
the
syrupy
feel
leaves
a
big
thick
layer
that
tickles
the
tongue
as
it
slowly
drips
off
some
lingering
sugar
and
syrupy
sweetness
slight
bitterness
with
that
too
lingering
fruits
and
nuts
as
well
as
the
booze
a
super
heavy
and
rich
beer
slow
sipper
great
for
sitting
by
a
fire
in
the
winter
which
im
dreaming
of
doing
now
in
this
blazing
heat
outside
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
not
good
it
tastes
nothing
like
a
doppelbock
it
syrupy
sweet
with
low
carbonation
which
makes
this
a
real
sipper
its
is
also
not
very
complex
all
you
need
is
2
ounces
to
know
what
this
beer
is
all
about
the
alcohol
is
really
hot
which
doesnt
help
either
i
know
this
beer
is
probably
too
fresh
but
if
thats
the
case
then
dont
put
it
on
the
shelf
maybe
if
you
put
this
in
the
cellar
for
3
to
5
years
it
might
be
somewhat
drinkable
on
the
label
it
says
the
worlds
most
extraordinary
beverage
i
think
not
i
couldnt
give
it
away
after
several
people
tried
it
and
ended
up
tossing
it
out
pours
a
rich
slightly
ruby
brown
color
that
would
look
great
as
stain
on
hardwood
floors
no
head
at
all
just
a
few
bubbles
that
line
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
malty
sweet
caramel
brown
sugar
molasses
and
cherry
also
a
slight
spiciness
the
flavor
is
amazingly
sweet
sweet
malt
is
the
main
flavor
but
it
also
has
caramel
molasses
cherry
and
plum
unlike
other
beers
of
this
strength
this
does
not
seem
to
have
anything
to
cover
up
the
unadulterated
sweetness
that
comes
with
a
beer
of
this
abv
speaking
of
which
the
only
thing
that
really
helps
cut
all
that
sweetness
is
the
considerable
alcoholic
warmth
the
mouthfeel
surprisingly
is
what
i
would
classify
as
the
heavier
side
of
medium
far
from
syrupy
and
full
it
also
has
a
fairly
pleasant
finish
and
drinks
much
more
like
a
spirit
than
a
high
octane
beer
that
being
said
it
is
not
very
drinkable
definitely
a
sipper
but
not
one
i
would
like
to
savor
this
beer
is
loved
by
many
i
know
and
far
be
it
from
me
to
stop
their
enjoyment
for
me
though
this
is
very
overrated
and
hardly
drinkable
d
the
noticeable
alcohol
makes
this
one
a
sipper
a
few
more
years
in
the
bottle
would
probably
help
still
pretty
good
overall
i
can
easily
finish
the
one
ive
opened
deep
amber
with
a
short
lived
pearl
white
head
perfectly
clear
huge
dose
of
caramel
malts
sweet
spicy
alcoholic
rum
and
raisins
hint
of
cocoa
yes
i
dig
this
very
much
so
a
chewy
and
rich
body
that
clings
to
the
glass
and
the
palate
warm
finish
drinkability
a
nice
sipper
and
seemingly
a
worthy
adversary
drinkability
is
what
it
is
due
to
high
abv
a
25
4
floz
bottle
is
a
force
to
reckon
with
a
worthy
foe
to
say
the
least
samichlaus
is
not
quite
as
tasty
exciting
or
interesting
as
i
expected
from
its
reputation
but
it
is
a
hell
of
a
beer
that
is
very
enjoyable
im
glad
i
bought
an
extra
bottle
tastes
good
feels
good
very
good
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
not
great
but
good
not
much
depth
or
complexity
to
the
flavor
however
rich
maltiness
is
everpresent
this
is
a
great
brew
i
look
forward
to
more
dopplebocks
this
is
a
serious
style
almost
a
bit
much
on
the
alcohol
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
a
desert
after
a
really
good
meal
i
think
i
will
put
a
handfull
of
these
into
my
cellar
for
a
few
years
o
this
is
truly
a
unique
beer
the
closest
beer
ive
tasted
to
coca
cola
very
sweet
a
dessert
beer
but
remarkably
drinkable
for
something
so
potent
this
thing
will
age
like
a
champ
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
smooth
but
ultimately
thinning
and
mouth
coating
as
is
to
be
expected
with
a
beer
this
high
in
alcohol
dominant
flavors
are
orange
peel
mature
brandy
figs
plums
and
pecans
i
hadnt
come
back
to
this
one
for
awhile
because
it
is
so
easy
to
get
but
it
really
is
a
fantastic
beer
very
low
carbonation
rich
velvety
body
fitting
alcohol
heat
is
noticeable
when
breathing
out
mmmm
dragons
i
got
this
at
a
whole
foods
in
middletown
nj
this
beer
pours
a
mahogany
brown
with
a
somewhat
small
heart
the
taste
and
smell
is
very
boozy
with
a
mixture
of
plums
sugar
vanilla
too
many
flavour
notes
to
count
mouthfeel
is
nice
medium
and
creamy
and
this
is
a
real
sipper
a
quality
entry
from
austria
drinkability
continuity
is
key
in
this
beer
somewhat
demanding
but
all
the
more
rewarding
you
wont
have
more
than
half
a
dozen
on
one
night
but
who
needs
it
so
damn
satisfying
and
holistic
its
sensory
compartments
that
it
is
youll
be
floored
before
by
its
fervour
before
you
know
it
d
this
is
a
beer
that
definitely
needs
to
be
sipped
but
its
perfect
for
keeping
warm
on
a
winter
evening
and
goes
down
rather
easily
notes
vintage
2009
very
big
boozy
and
sweet
beer
i
found
the
alcohol
to
be
too
strong
a
lot
of
the
time
similar
to
a
digestifliqueur
type
of
drink
sip
it
slow
and
enjoy
definitely
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
to
give
it
a
try
i
would
like
to
try
one
after
it
has
been
in
a
cellar
for
a
couple
of
years
to
see
how
the
alcohol
and
flavors
have
meldedsmoothed
out
not
my
favorite
beer
but
it
definitely
fills
a
niche
d
great
beer
but
one
bottle
will
be
enough
for
a
long
sitting
pours
from
the
12
oz
bottle
a
colaish
brown
with
a
very
slight
head
that
disappears
into
nothing
in
no
time
almost
zero
carbonation
the
bubbles
are
few
far
between
aroma
is
sweet
and
syrupy
1st
sip
is
pancake
syrup
sweet
with
a
noticeable
undertone
of
alcohol
that
burns
slightly
on
the
way
down
mouthfeel
is
very
light
almost
watery
flat
from
the
lack
of
carbonation
overall
i
have
to
rate
this
a
disappointment
cloyingly
sticky
sweet
with
almost
no
hops
or
malt
and
alcohol
harshness
hopefully
this
will
improve
with
age
d
definitely
not
a
frat
boy
chugging
kind
of
beer
thats
for
sure
makes
a
great
winter
warmer
seasonal
beer
however
i
bought
this
in
april
and
it
is
65
degrees
outside
so
this
wasnt
the
opportune
time
to
be
drinking
this
particular
beer
cellar
this
one
and
drink
on
the
coldest
winter
day
somehow
managaes
to
be
a
little
thin
in
the
body
overall
an
above
average
beer
that
im
glad
i
tried
three
quarters
of
the
way
through
i
could
sure
feel
that
14

abv
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
that
was
better
once
it
warmed
up
to
room
temperature
i
tried
this
beer
before
and
i
believe
it
was
cold
it
does
much
better
warm
but
it
still
isnt
very
good
better
than
average
but
not
amazing
this
beer
is
brewed
once
a
year
on
december
6th
for
st
nicholas
day
and
at
a
whopping
14
it
is
said
that
it
is
the
strongest
lager
beer
in
the
world
according
to
the
guinness
book
of
records
this
beer
smells
like
caramelized
malts
honey
eggnog
dates
and
a
high
alcohol
nose
it
tastes
sweet
more
toffee
than
honey
with
a
hint
of
hops
raisins
plums
and
a
hint
of
molasses
it
definitely
goes
down
dangerously
smooth
for
14
now
i
have
had
this
beer
before
i
even
served
it
at
my
own
holiday
tastings
because
i
like
it
so
much
but
to
have
it
served
out
of
a
3l
thats
pretty
amazing

to
mention
how
much
smoother

smelled

not
obtrusively

behind

stands
very
high

more

for
sipping

im

last
thing
i
really
needed
was
a
reason
to
hold
onto
bottles
for
15
years
before
opening
them
but
this
this
is
a
gateway
to
the
dark
side
as
drinkable
as
a
beer
that
is
meant
to
be
sipped
should
be
ive
got
a
750
ml
bottle
of
this
one
and
after
having
this
12
oz
serving
i
know
ill
have
to
share
it
this
beer
is
dark
redbrown
with
no
real
head
it
smells
like
dark
fruit
brown
sugar

it
is
strong
and
sweet
with
flavors
of
burnt
sugar
toast

alcohol
the
aftertaste
is

slightly

such
a

as
smells
but
with

great

wonders
on

i
may
buy
it
again
simply
with
the
intent
of
aging
it
for
5
years
but
this
thing
is
way
too
cloying
and
hot
to
drink
fresh
drinkability
mixed
its
so
surprising
that
its
a
wonderful
beer
to
try
and
to
experience
but
the
sugars
and
alcohol
are
so
dominant
that
it
would
be
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
its
a
bit
like
an
overly
sweet
brandy
and
probably
should
be
enjoyed
in
a
similar
way
d
this
is
so
strong
that
i
seriously
doubt
you
will
be
having
more
than
one
i
didnt
enjoy
the
last
few
sips
of
this
beer
simply
because
its
so
strong
and
it
wears
you
down
after
a
while
d
my
first
sami
from
eggenberg
also
my
youngest
still
quite
hot
at
a
year
but
surprisingly
quite
complex
and
drinkable
for
summin
14
abv
overall
a
great
nostalgic
beer
for
me
cant
wait
to
put
some
age
on
these
just
an
incredible
treat
to
savour
and
enjoy
i
must
say
this
old
standby
is
far
more
preferred
to
more
acclaimed
thomas
hardy
as
well
as
the
extra
strong
lagers
that
are
on
the
lighter
side
this
is
a
damn
near
perfect
execution
which
is
no
small
feat
considering
the
size
of
this
beast
yum
i
have
a
magic
closet
with
no
doubt
this
is
the
fourth
good
beer
ive
managed
to
hide
from
myself
only
to
find
at
a
later
date
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
its
unique
so
you
should
give
it
a
go
if
you
get
the
chance
overall
a
complex
beer
that
is
a
musttry
because
of
its
fame
and
significance
but
dont
crack
open
the
freshest
batch
or
you
may
be
underwhelmed
still
interesting
and
complex
but
not
up
to
its
potential
in
my
opinion
d
it
took
a
lot
from
me
to
try
and
choke
this
beer
down
the
sweetness
got
to
me
after
about
the
third
sip
i
have
3
more
sitting
in
the
cellar
that
looks
like
they
will
be
aging
a
little
while
longer
d
high
abv
but
a
great
sipper
to
share
with
your
mates
taste
slightly
toasted
caramel
and
a
little
brown
sugar
blended
with
plum
wine
that
has
a
slight
fruit
juice
character
turns
into
an
interesting
play
between
earthy
spices
and
aged
dark
sourness
and
a
little
mineral
though
everything
rides
over
a
rich
brown
sugar
note
for
me
its
not
anywhere
near
too
sweet
a
hint
of
alcohol
is
noticeable
finish
is
sweet
juicy
nutmeg
mineral
and
dries
out
a
bit
after
a
moment
im
probably
going
to
revisit
this
one
when
its
aged
and
hopefully
mellowed
out
some
as
it
is
its
just
too
boozy
and
i
couldnt
get
past
it
usually
doesnt
bother
me
in
these
high
abv
brews
but
this
one
was
rough
surprisingly
the
booze
isnt
too
strong
for
being
14
its
very
sweet
but
still
drinkable
a
bit
bitter
but
not
much
for
hops
here
interesting
beer
worth
giving
a
shot
d
in
small
doses
i
think
this
would
be
great
however
i
highly
reccomend
trying
this
with
something
salted
some
meat
or
some
cheese
i
believe
when
paired
with
any
of
those
offerings
the
overpowering
sweetness
of
this
beer
would
match
perfectly
tried
by
itself
i
cannot
get
past
the
richness
of
the
flavor
its
almost
like
a
dessert
that
is
too
rich
this
review
is
a
reflection
of
my
experience
tonight
perhaps
i
will
try
it
again
when
pairing
it
with
the
food
mentioned
above
prior
to
january
of
this
year
im
sorry
to
say
i
wasnt
familiar
with
this
beer
i
was
lucky
enough
to
get
this
as
an
anniversary
gift
from
my
wife
part
of
a
beer
gift
basket
ive
enjoyed
it
immensely
highly
recommended
im
storing
away
the
rest
of
this
fourpack
heres
hoping
that
a
few
years
will
mature
this
brew
taking
it
a
bit
closer
to
the
reputation
that
it
gained
over
its
history
overall
i
like
it
but
not
as
much
as
i
used
to
still
its
a
good
beer
and
ill
still
try
it
from
time
to
time
d
i
love
this
beer
to
me
its
like
drinking
a
fizzy
port
with
more
sweetness
on
the
back
of
the
palate
a
definite
sipper
i
have
managed
to
down
3
in
one
sitting
but
at
14
abv
as
well
as
being
pricey
it
is
definitely
not
a
session
beer
will
cellar
well
too
if
you
have
the
patience
d
5
0
incredible
such
complexity
it
is
simply
amazing
as
to
what
some
age
has
done
for
this
beer
my
understanding
is
that
the
recipe
is
still
the
same
but
14
years
has
made
this
an
exquisite
and
one
of
the
most
memorable
beers
ive
ever
tried
this
is
a
clear
sitandenjoybeforethefirebeer
and
let
it
last
for
a
long
time
d
for
14
this
beer
is
an
easy
sipper
id
worry
about
cloying
if
i
had
too
many
but
i
dont
see
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
d
for
what
it
is
it
is
pretty
drinkable
i
dont
taste
the
14
that
the
label
suggests
its
obviously
a
sipper
get
it
clear
dark
ruby
with
a
slight
creamy
skim
of
cream
colored
foam
the
nose
is
big
and
alcoholic
with
buttered
rum
dark
fruit
and
oaky
vanilla
bean
the
flavor
is
very
rich
and
vinuous
tasting
with
notes
of
spiced
rum
and
prune
juice
that
grow
more
complex
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
thick
and
syrupy
bodied
with
subtle
carbonation
that
adds
to
the
drinkability
id
bet
a
year
or
so
in
the
cellar
would
do
this
beer
some
good
anyway
its
a
very
dark
beer
with
a
strong
dark
fruit
malt
flavor
but
still
not
strong
enough
to
balance
the
alcohol
or
the
sweetness
mouthfeel
very
thick
full
bodied
with
little
carbonation
realized
i
hadnt
actually
reviewed
this
yet
kind
of
surprised
but
im
glad
i
still
had
a
bottle
of
2006
to
open
up
instead
of
a
newer
release
d
i
had
the
2009
version
but
i
guess
that
the
other
bottles
i
bought
and
cellered
will
improve
over
the
years
a
very
very
intersting
and
nice
beer
that
probably
will
be
greater
for
each
year
ill
manage
to
keep
my
hands
off
overall
my
friend
and
i
agree
that
this
was
truly
a
great
brew
and
i
may
track
it
down
and
buy
it
again
if
the
price
is
reasonable
paid
6
00
for
my
bottle
2006
vintage
pours
orangishyellow
with
a
white
head
very
clear
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
honey
and
brown
sugar
the
flavor
is
lots
of
honey
with
some
alcohol
very
sweet
lots
of
fruit
in
there
as
well
medium
mouthfeel
really
good
atmosphere
appearance
is
deep
dark
and
pristine
but
not
overly
exciting
nose
is
outstanding
great
tones
great
combination
of
elements
flavor
has
outstanding
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
very
much
a
dessert
beer
just
as
one
would
consider
a
sherry
or
a
port
it
honestly
feels
like
a
real
dessert
in
itself
like
drinking
a
bottle
of
hersheys
syrup
dnot
one
to
pound
back
to
back
surely
but
a
brew
that
deserves
a
place
in
my
cellar
well
done
dit
has
insane
drinkability
for
a
14
beer
its
almost
cordiallike
in
its
body
and
a
great
beer
for
cold
winter
nights
d
i
could
very
easily
mistake
this
for
an
8
or
9
beer
definitely
a
beer
that
would
help
me
get
through
a
christmas
with
my
highly
dysfunctional
family
i
know
samichlaus
is
a
doppelbock
but
it
has
many
similarities
to
old
ale
or
better
barleywines
im
not
complaining
that
makes
it
one
of
the
best
doppels
ive
had
drinkability
ill
get
it
again
a
nice
christmas
sipper
pretty
damn
good
really
not
an
everyday
beer
due
to
the
alcohol
content
i
found
the
sweetness
in
this
beer
to
be
overpowering
the
color
and
feel
of
this
beer
were
outstanding
i
would
say
the
12oz
bottle
should
be
shared
between
23
people
i
tried
to
enjoy
this
as
a
pint
and
was
overwhelmed
poured
in
a
goblet
the
beer
was
a
chesnut
color
with
virtually
no
head
the
aroma
was
fruity
caramel
and
whiskey
the
taste
was
of
caramel
and
some
kind
of
dark
fruit
the
whiskey
taste
was
there
but
muted
i
thought
this
was
a
fairly
mellow
beer
not
hot
the
alcohol
is
there
though
so
be
careful
with
this
one
d
liked
the
bomber
because
its
hard
to
split
the
regular
size
bottles
each
year
this
beer
continues
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
winter
warmers
hohoho
merry
christmas
ba
enjoy
this
winter
winner
poured
this
beer
in
a
goblet
smell
was
very
sweet
as
the
taste
was
sweet
stronger
alcohol
taste
at
the
end
14abv
it
shows
a
dark
brown
in
the
glass
the
head
was
gone
almost
immediately
with
minimal
lacing
the
taste
was
good
sweet
alcohol
strong
like
the
review
belowe
me
full
bodied
low
carbonation
syrupy
with
a
heavy
sweet
character
brown
sugar
taste
almost
overall
very
good
beer
the
drink
ability
i
would
score
more
but
being
so
strong
and
powerful
taste
its
more
of
a
slow
sipping
beer
overall
good
drinkability
a
real
sipper
really
sweet
so
has
a
good
place
as
an
after
meal
dessert
overall
this
is
a
very
rich
and
complex
brew
as
you
would
expect
from
a
good
doppelbock
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
tasting
brews
ive
had
in
awhile
and
i
would
say
that
this
brew
is
close
to
falling
under
the
category
of
exceptional
definitely
a
nice
wintertime
beer
as
well
its
not
the
most
extraordinary
liquid
that
ive
ever
imbibed
but
this
is
one
is
definitely
worth
picking
up
d
anyone
who
says
the
samichlaus
is
drinkable
is
either
immortal
or
is
a
liar
it
is
a
tasty
treat
of
which
one
is
plenty
this
is
not
a
beer
that
pairs
easily
with
food
i
might
recommend
some
cheese
or
nuts
but
definitely
not
a
foodfriendly
option
da
delicious
beer
i
will
save
the
rest
for
after
dinner
this
is
a
real
sipper
that
will
kick
your
ass
and
deprive
you
of
its
qualities
if
you
rush
it
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
one
that
has
aged
unbelievably
well
there
are
only
the
faintest
hints
of
oxidation
and
they
have
actually
added
to
the
complexity
though
the
alcohol
is
evident
its
very
drinkable
for
a
14abv
beer
wonderful

the

pours
a
chillhazed
beautiful
deep
amber
color
with
slowly
rising
carbonation
and
a
shortlived
fizzy
head
smells
of
caramel
fruits
rum
bread
maraschino
cherry
and
just
a
breath
of
alcohol
the

is
very

with
fruits
and
heavy
caramelization
chocolatecovered

rum

floralperfumy
alcohol
hints
of

cinnamon
a
touch
of
roast

perhaps
some
floral
hops
and
a
mild
bitterness
that
slowly
increases
there
is
also
a
boatload
of
residual
sweetness
but
it
somehow
manages
to
steer
clear
of
becoming
cloying
well
done
the
body
is
thick
smooth
and
a
little
dry
with
an
aftertaste
that
lingers
forever
pretty
low
on
the
drinkability
meter
but
the
sippability
score
would
be
quite
high
at
first
i
thought
this
was
too
sweet
but
it
really
needs
the
sweetness
to
balance
the
strong
malt
flavors
and
high
alcohol
this
is
a
big
meaty
delicious
and
layered
lager
that
makes
for
the
perfect
nightcap
and
it
helps
to
ward
off
the
chill
of
new
england
winter
nights
happy
birthday
dad
hard
to
drink
but
good
flavor
great
stuff
had
been
staring
at
this
in
the
store
for
a
while
now
and
glad
i
finally
grabbed
a
4
pack
i
enjoy
the
ledgend
or
history
of
this
beer
and
wished
i
had
had
a
nice
fire
to
sit
in
front
of
as
i
sipped
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
and
very
strong
like
a
waystrong
ale
warming
and
not
too
difficult
to
drink
overall
kinda
cool
this
beer
poured
with
a
generous
head
despite
the
age
on
it
i
read
other
reviews
saying
they
got
no
head
maybe
they
used
the
wrong
glass
i
used
a
stella
snifter
nose
was
big
time
fruit
almonds
and
booze
big
ripe
cherry
aroma
with
some
mild
spice
notes
and
caramel
malt
character
the
taste
is
nicely
complex
with
pale
and
caramel
malt
backing
ripe
red
cherries
sweet
oak
chips
a
huge
nuttiness
with
an
almond
paste
and
cherry
macadamias
mouthfeel
was
syrupy
oily
yet
sufficiently
carbonated
somewhat
of
a
sipper
very
nice
complexity
to
this
brew
booze
was
noticeable
but
that
is
expected
and
welcome
in
a
14
doppelbock
i
would
hate
to
see
anybody
slam
this
beer
or
lower
its
score
because
of
the
booziness
d
its
not
a
special
day
i
just
saw
it
and
said
i
finally
need
to
drink
this
one
maybe
its
the
impending
christmas
season
the
cool
air
or
the
fact
i
started
getting
the
christmas
lights
out
but
im
glad
im
having
it
a
bit
boozy
for
my
tastes
but
one
hell
of
a
dopplebock
and
a
great
winter
warming
sipper
room
temperature
might
be
good
for
it
too
also
for
its
age
the
alcohol
has
probably
mellowed
that
would
make
this
one
boozy
beer
when
its
fresh
drinkability
no
question
about
it
this
is
a
sipping
beer
to
spend
a
long
time
with
both
with
this
abv
and
complexity
of
the
flavor
a
small
sip
goes
a
long
way
i
can
also
see
now
why
some
people
love
this
beer
and
some
people
hate
it
but
it
is
also
clear
that
this
is
a
beer
to
set
aside
until
its
2nd
or
3rd
birthday
before
even
thinking
about
tasting
it
also
dont
even
look
at
buying
this
beer
if
you
cant
stand
after
dinner
liqueurs
i
still
respect
the
beer
and
the
legend
i
think
i
definitely
need
to
give
it
another
shot
maybe
age
the
bottle
and
let
its
fiercity
mellow
down
i
didnt
like
it
first
up
but
i
want
to
have
another
shot
at
it
i
am
sure
that
my
opinion
will
change
not
bad
but
the
alcohol
is
way
to
much
it
is
worth
a
try
and
something
that
i
would
like
to
cellar
for
a
few
years
to
see
what
happens
drinkability
one
bottle
if
that
i
mean
its
14
be
careful
with
this
one
definitely
a
sipper
the
taste
is
has
some
similar
elements
but
is
much
better
with
some
complexity
intriguing
qualities
some
good
flavours
and
a
solid
warm
oily
feel
however
it
is
still
overly
tasting
of
fermented
fried
grain
products
and
really
very
very
sweet
it
has
old
sherry
fermented
grain
and
apple
fritters
fruit
faint
roasted
grain
element
and
a
hint
of
flowery
bitterness
the
alcohol
is
clearly
evident
and
very
srong
although
its
not
rough
and
its
a
lot
less
alcoholic
in
character
than
a
number
of
far
weaker
beers
ive
had
it
has
a
full
warm
oily
feel
that
is
a
little
too
much
its
fine
to
sip
a
little
bit
but
not
something
id
be
very
interested
in
and
the
aroma
is
really
quite
odd
the
flavors
dont
quite
live
up
to
the
nose
opening
very
sweet
and
almost
sugary
with
brown
sugar
honey
and
a
definite
soy
component
surprisingly
simple
and
thin
the
mid
palate
has
a
little
dark
fruit
character
with
plums
and
raisins
finishing
with
a
little
alcoholic
heat
this
is
really
smooth
the
finish
has
a
touch
of
harshness
that
attacks
the
rear
end
of
the
roof
of
the
palate
but
otherwise
i
have
no
complaints
medium
in
body
with
a
low
carbonation
this
is
creamy
and
smooth
im
a
little
disappointed
by
the
lack
of
richness
on
the
finish
but
for
the
most
part
i
am
very
happy
i
got
to
try
this
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
i
generally
prefer
but
not
bad
i
guess
this
beer
is
the
definition
of
a
sipper
and
really
doesnt
float
my
boat
but
it
is
impressive
for
what
it
is
d
the
06
brew
is
much
better
tasting
and
much
easier
to
drink
the
older
version
was
too
over
the
top
but
06
was
a
great
smooth
powerful
beer
cheers
even
the
bubbles
seem
scared
trapped
against
the
glass
it
might
be
better
to
take
shots
of
im
sure
i
could
offer
this
as
shots
to
friends
and
they
wouldnt
even
know
better
this
is
not
a
doppelbock
i
dont
care
what
anyone
says
try
at
your
own
discretion
this
is
just
a
fantastic
beer
i
dont
recommend
more
than
2
itll
put
you
on
your
ass
even
though
its
hard
to
say
no
i
had
previously
believed
that
the
taste
of
christmas
was
found
in
bottle
of
eggnog
i
was
right
of
course
but
if
the
taste
of
christmas
was
to
be
found
in
a
bottle
of
beer
it
would
have
to
be
a
bottle
of
samichlaus
i
have
drunk
several
of
these
on
several
occasions
and
each
time
it
has
been
a
fantastic
beertrip
tip
when
first
opened
sniff
the
escaping
fumes
that
are
released
and
you
will
be
pleasantly
surprised
this
truly
is
the
rolls
royce
of
beer
once
poured
it
has
an
understated
elegance
with
no
head
to
speak
of
but
yet
you
have
the
feeling
that
something
extraordinarily
fine
is
in
your
hands
at
the
first
sip
and
maybe
even
the
fifth
you
will
have
started
to
appreciate
the
samiclaus
this
brew
gets
better
as
your
glass
gets
emptier
as
the
deep
flavors
reveal
themselves
like
the
details
in
a
fine
rug
this
brew
once
consumed
will
give
you
a
buzz
that
is
distinctly
a
samichlaus
buzz
indeed
it
could
lead
to
a
samichlaus
day
merry
christmas
brewed
at
christmas
and
for
good
reason
this
is
a
contemplative
sipper
that
deserves
time
to
warm
up
and
express
its
full
flavors
i
wish
i
had
a
endless
glass
of
this
stuff
i
could
sip
it
by
a
fire
all
day
and
night
this
beer
makes
me
happy
to
be
alive
taste
the
flavors
are
somewhat
simple
but
its
very
rich
and
wonderful
i
was
surprised
how
much
it
tastes
like
a
normal
doppelbock
given
the
ramped
up
abv
a
real
sipper
of
a
beer
for
sure
bottle
from
2008
tasted
909
pours
very
dark
coper
with
a
light
tan
head
that
disappears
quickly
without
leaving
any
lacing
behind
strong
sugary
sweet
malt
aromas
with
a
lot
of
fruitiness
heady
alcohol
smell
with
some
caramel
taste
is
cloyingly
sweet
big
malt
with
some
pearlike
esters
strong
heavily
warming
alcohol
syrupy

no
real

to
this
one
just

and

not
great
to
drink
or
even
sip
2006
vintage

bottle
poured
into
my
standard
tulip
glass
appears
a
dark
amberchestnut
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
fluffy
rust
colored
foam
aromas
and
flavors
consist
of
dark
fruits
such
as
cherries
plums
raisins
tons
of
sweet
malt
chocolate
brown
sugar
nicely
toasted
grain
approaching
full
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
smooth
and
a
bit
boozy
quite
drinkable
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
sipper
i
have
one
left
i
think
ill
hold
on
to
if
for
a
few
more
years
and
try
it
again
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
big
beer
among
big
beers
id
recommend
a
samichlaus
ive
been
told
that
this
is
quite
the
rarity
and
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
grab
a
few
of
these
o
awesome
bier
to
savor
into
the
night
very
sweet
hope
to
keep
a
few
around
for
the
winter
holidays
d
despite
the
fact
that
this
is
a
big
beer
i
could
drink
several
in
one
sitting
low
carbonation
very
smooth
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
ive
had
despite
the
14
abv
very
easy
to
drink
beer
was
like
syrup
poured
into
the
glass
dark
dark
dark
thick
almost
no
carbonation
so
no
head
at
all
smell
knocks
you
over
raisins
sweetness
malt
malt
malt
this
is
definetly
a
beer
that
i
can
just
keep
smelling
for
several
minutes
completely
content
without
taking
a
sip
eventually
i
did
take
a
sip
and
all
the
wonderfulness
exploded
in
my
mouth
this
beer
was
smooth
and
warming
probably
the
14
alcohol
the
sweetness
was
not
overwhelming
and
it
went
down
smooth
feeling
no
pain
after
that
the
beer
was
served
in
a
0

l
sammichlaus
glass
how
awesome
is
that
i
can
seem
myself
drinking
this
for
nikolaustag
with
some
delicious
fruechtebrot
drinkability
amazingly
drinkable
especially
for
a
huge
beer
i
am
interested
to
see
how
this
develops
as
i
put
a
few
in
the
cellar
a
lovely
sipper
methinks
it
would
soar
with
a
nice
cigar
as
for
the
santa
claus
theme
as
wellstructured
and
tasty
a
strong
beer
this
is
i
dont
know
that
ol
saint
nick
would
do
well
to
have
one
of
these
with
the
requisite
cookies
leaving
the
milk
for
the
kiddees
in
the
morning
and
not
be
cited
for
an
sui
sleighing
under
the
influence
ideally
save
it
for
the
easy
chair
and
roaring
fire
i
dont
know
what
my
problem
is
here
then
it
being
midsummer
and
whatnot

content
flavor
is
dominated
by

dark
fruit
again
the
raisen
and
prune
and
fruity
esters
clearly
balanced
on
the
malt
side
of
the
flavor
scale
although
it
has
enough
hop
bitterness
to
keep
it
from
being
sickly
sweet
alcohol
prominent
too
but
it
isnt
hot
nor
does
it
detract
from
the
wonderful
malty
flavor
this
is
a
substantial
beer
that
has
been
well
crafted
overall
i
like
this
beer
and
i
wish
i
tried
this
in
the
winter
time
vice
late
spring
this
beer
is
absolutely
wonderful
drinkability
gets
a
little
bit
knocked
off
due
to
the
high
abv
but
of
course
this
is
a
beer
meant
to
be
enjoyed
during
the
holidays
and
when
better
than
to
let
loose
and
celebrate
a
bit
with
a
14
haha
if
you
get
the
chance
i
say
dont
let
this
one
pass
you
by
one
of
my
favorite
beers
other
than
the
typical
german
beer
the
foam
when
poured
was
bubbly
wheat
in
color
and
dissapated
quickly
which
wasnt
anticipated
thought
it
would
be
a
thick
foam

was

some

drinkability
rich
and
complex
the
type
that
needs
to
be
savored
sip

overall
strong
stuff
i
would
drink
again
on
tap
at
515

poured
into
a
snifter
deep
amber
with
a
fluffy
and
sticky
beige
head
aromas
of
caramel
eggnog
raisins
other
dried
fruits
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
borders
on
cloying
unless
you
really
take
your
time
big
honey
and
raisin
notes
with
a
very
syrupy
texture
alcohol
is
obviously
present
but
not
distractingly
harsh
too
thick
and
sweet
for
me
this
beer
obviously
gets
better
with
age
and
after
only
two
years
this
particular
vintage
is
already
brilliant
i
think
this
is
fantastic
and
dangerous
tasty
high
alcohol
this
is
a
sipper
if
i
have
ever
had
one
very
well
done
the
aging
must
have
mellowed
the
feel
and
flavor
but
in
a
tasteful
way
at
22
a
four
pack
its
something
i
wont
have
anytime
soon
again
but
golly
it
was
interesting
tyson
liked
it
so
much
he
gave
me
the
money
to
buy
another
just
for
him
notes
wow
this
is
one
big
beer
very
alcoholic
with
a
nice
dark
fruit
profile
that
tastes
way
too
sweet
for
me
though
i
cant
help
but
think
that
this
would
be
the
perfect
candidate
for
cellaring
as
it
is
its
interesting
but
too
boozy
sweet
poured
a
brown
color
with
very
little
to
no
head
but
the
smell
was
nice
since
it
was
spicy
and
malty
very
little
carbonation
with
a
very
sweet
molasses
or
caramel
or
syrup
or
all
taste
mixed
with
a
hint
of
fruit
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
in
this
beer
a
very
sweet
malty
flavor
and
it
was
smooth
you
can
feel
the
punch
of
alcohol
from
the
first
sip
it
went
down
like
a
cognac
or
brandy
and
was
quite
enjoyable
it
was
quite
good
and
i
will
seek
it
out
and
hopefully
enjoy
it
again

this
is
a
beer
to
be

perfect
for
winter
nights
either
with
chocolate

desserts

by
itself

moderate
quantities
it
is
unique
enough
to
be

being
enough
for

its

get

the
alcohol

cloying

times

good
and
interesting
dopple
though

suffers
a
little
due

this

i
would
definitely
seek
this
one

treat
for

so
tasty
that
i
really
wanted
to
say
a
higher
rating
but
the
14

is
prohibitive
d
an
excellent
beer
but
almost
a
replacement
for
a
cordial
this
is
too
flavorful
and
high
in
alcohol
to
have
more
than
one
but
is
an
excellent
nightcap

a
beer
to
be

and

a
shot
of
good
quality
cherryplum
liquor
in
a
sense
it
reminds
me
of
several
english
barley
wine
ive
tasted
and
from
that
perspective
this
beer
is
unlike
any
other
doppelbock
ive
tried
or
am
able
to
imagine

pretty
clear

will
do
this

less

very
warming
and
smooth
ethanolic
malty
sweet
hints
of
vanilla
and
butterscotch
o
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
aging
i
had
the
2011
version
and
it
was
aged
one
year
it
will
knock
you
on
your
ass
but
it
is
an
extremely
complex
and
delightful
beer
drinkability
this
is
a
very
strong
beer
even
if
there
wasnt
a
ton
of
alcohol
in
it
its
heavy
thick
and
sweet
these
factors
all
limit
drinkability
considerably
a
12ounce
bottle
of
this
stuff
would
be
enough
for
all
but
the
most
seasoned
drinkers
two
bottles
would
result
in
bad
decisions
i
wonder
though
if
the
drinkability
would
improve
with
age
at
least
in
terms
of
the
weight
and
thickness
of
this
brew
i
think
ill
cellar
a
few
of
these
and
find
out
pours
a
clear
amber
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
strong
malt
earthy
malts
slight
fruit
aroma
and
some
yeast
cleanliness
at
this
point
if
fits
the
doppelbock
style
quite
nicely
very
bitter
and
high
alcohol
is
noticeable
in
the
mouth
feel
smooth
and
crisp
along
with
a
slightly
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
malt
upfront
with
a
general
sweetness
closely
following
a
slight
hop
flavor
is
present
in
the
aftertaste
along
with
a
little
fruitiness
the
alcohol
packs
quite
a
punch
but
the
overall
flavor
is
amazing
the
sweetness
maltiness
and
slight
fruitiness
is
absolutely
amazing
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
a
try
fortunately
they
gave
me
an
extra
bottle
to
take
home
and
find
out
great
nightcap
beer
in
the
future
i
will
try
to
cellar
a
bottle
or
two
and
see
what
develops
bottom
line
this
one
will
warm
you
up
on
a
cold
day
but
could
really
use
some
more
age
to
mellow
it
out
a
little
bit
this
was
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
but
pretty
good
i
wont
be
stocking
up
on
these
but
i
can
definitely
see
how
this
would
improve
substantially
with
age
a
unique
beer
worth
everyone
giving
a
whirl
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
drinkabilitydefinately
a
sipping
beer
but
not
a
great
one
maybe
this
beer
gets
better
with
age
but
i
wont
be
buying
another
one
at
4
95
for
a
11
5
oz
bottle
edit
so
i
had
the
2006
bottle
last
nite
225
cant
say
if
it
tasted
any
different
from
the
2007s
ive
had
so
there
warming
and
full
mouthfeel
slightly
syrapy
but
the
alcohol
works
to
its
advantagethis
is
one
pleasant
sipper
one
12
oz
bottle
is
perfect
a
second
bottle
would
be
foolish
but
fun
pours
a
wonderful
dark
candy
red
smells
of
sugars
and
alcohol
dominate
taste
follows
suit
slightly
boozy
but
with
the
dark
fruits
i
want
from
a
beer
like
this
the
fact
this
is
a
14
beer
is
downright
terrifying
to
me
too
much
of
this
would
kill
me
though
this
is
a
beer
im
going
to
start
hiding
away
every
year
mfd
for
the
bread
in
a
cup
beer
that
a
doppelbock
is
supposed
to
be
this
is
amazing
a
syrup
like
mouth
feel
and
a
real
wide
and
full
body
make
this
beer
formidable
if
there
is
a
fault
here
i
am
too
buzzed
to
notice
i
think
i
shall
go
back
to
the
store
and
buy
up
the
rest
of
the
bottles
and
let
them
age
drinkability
this
is
the
brandy
of
beers
drink
slow
with
sips
and
enjoy
your
time
with
it
because
your
not
having
another
drinking
one
left
me
happily
buzzed
overall
a
phenomenal
beer
every
bit
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
highly

sweetness
that
overstays
its
welcome
in
my

although
i
must
remind
myself
that
is
in

with
the
style
the
lack
of

makes
me
think
this
is
hardly
a
beer
oh
im
so
conflicted
on
this
one
with
the
long
life
this
capable
of
im
tempted
to
lay
a
half
dozen
of
these
down
for
five
years
and
try
it
again
particularly
if
i
find
myself
by
a
toasty
fireplace
in
a
comfy
chalet
in
the
dead
cold
of
a
freezing
winter
evening
a
must
try
but
not
one
of
my
favourite
beer
styles
rating
this
high
on
drinkability
because
it
is
excellent
the
abv
is
a
bit
discomforting
but
having
23
bottles
over
the
course
of
a
long
cold
night
with
a
nice
aged
gouda
would
be
excellent
all
in
all
this
is
a
pleasant
experience
for
such
a
strong
beer
hopefully
ill
pick
another
one
of
these
up
and
cellar
it
for
a
good
while
pours
maple
syrup
brown
and
clear
with
little
head
smells
very
very
sweet
tastes
super
sweet
as
well
with
a
little
bitterness
to
the
finish
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
but
syrupy
surprisingly
drinkable
for
the
abv
i
like
this
one
but
i
guess
ive
got
a
sweet
tooth
d
since
the
intense
sweet
character
and
high
abv
one
of
these
is
far
enough
first
attempt
at
immediate
online
reviewing
procedure
needs
work
pours
a
light
copper
fairly
seethrough
with
just
a
bit
of
head
goes
away
quickly
and
no
lacing
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
deep
scent
very
malty
with
obvious
alcohol
aromas
and
a
bit
of
caramal
and
a
hint
of
spice
deep
taste
huge
malts
with
a
very
noticable
alcohol
hit
goes
down
a
bit
thick
pretty
good
except
for
the
overalcohol
flavor
bottle
says
14
abv
this
might
just
knock
me
out
for
the
night
deep
ruby
red
clear
with
a
smallish
head
doesnt
look
particularly
formidable
aroma
is
rich
fruitiness
which
pretty
much
obliterates
anything
else
that
might
be
here
first
sip
is
very
sweet
with
a
surprisingly
well
hidden
alcohol
lots
of
fruit
with
almost
no
carbonation
and
a
syrupy
body
bitterness
is
extremely
low
or
perhaps
more
accurately
balanced
out
by
the
intense
sugary
sweetness
flavour
is
red
berries
and
a
hint
of
cherry
and
maybe
some
mediumdark
sugars
had
enough
balance
to
keep
one
bottle
from
being
cloying
but
the
second
may
be
undrinkable
far
too
sweet
to
have
as
anything
but
a
dessertdigestif
fwiw
its
quite
a
good
big
sweet
beer
otoh
its
awfully
big
and
sweet
matches
well
with
chocolate
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
drinks
more
like
a
liquor
and
was
nice
to
have
by
my
side
to
sip
for
over
an
hour
d
certainly
a
unique
experience
that
i
wont
soon
forget
a
good
brew
to
visit
once
a
year
this
is
my
first
review
of
a
beer
on
ba
you
can
try
this
beer
but
i
advise
you
only
try
a
single
bottle
and
have
other
beers
as
backups
you
arent
proving
anything
by
drinking
this
thing
drinkability
i
can
taste
the
alcohol
and
could
not
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
due
to
the
abv
this
is
a
good
dopplebock
but
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
amazing
in
that
i
did
not
feel
the
14
abv
balance
was
great
and
taste
was
more
than
above
average
d
this
is
no
wee
brew
lads
a
sixer
of
these
will
knock
ye
on
ye
backs
but
you
can
sip
on
one
for
over
an
hour
and
it
just
grows
in
flavor
so
id
say
slow
drinkable
but
very
drinkable
nonetheless
easily
one
of
my
favorite
beers
drinkability
very
good
beer
but
take
them
one
at
a
time
ill
definitely
be
buying
it
again
d
this
really
could
be
a
great
beer
and
from
all
accounts
it
used
to
be
but
the
alcohol
comes
in
at
the
end
where
i
wish
they
would
have
put
some
smoky
characteristics
to
hide
it
mouthfeel
is
light
despite
its
mediumheavy
body
crisp
silky
smooth
sticky
on
the
palate
syrupy
as
well
buttery
in
the
mouth
goes
down
extremely
well
despite
its
abv
very
drinkable
but
it
needs
to
be
sipped
carbonation
is
somewhat
light
but
its
a
perfect
fit
its
amazing
how
many
different
flavors
i
found
sipping
a
glass
of
this
awesome
truly
an
outstanding
brew
a
fantastic
dopplebock
drinkability
drinkable
but
only
a
little
at
a
time
high
enough
alcohol
content
where
it
does
not
have
you
running
back
for
a
second
heck
i
may
store
the
other
3
i
have
from
this
vintage
and
see
how
they
taste
in
the
coming
years
overall
noticeably
different
but
nothing
to
rave
about
2005
vintage
pours
brownruby
with
excellent
clarity
minimal
head
nose
white
grapes
sweet
malts
and
honey
taste
nuts
dark
fruits
honey
thick
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
very
much
a
dessert
type
beverage
drinkability
is
actually
not
bad
given
strength
its
sweet
but
not
sickly
sweet
d
tough
to
take
a
lot
of
this
stuff
but
enjoyable
in
small
amounts
i
can
see
how
this
beer
could
be
a
fun
beer
to
drink
every
christmas
ill
pick
up
a
bottle
and
let
it
sit
around
for
a
while
i
would
have
loved
to
have
done
a
side
by
side
taste
test
with
the
93
bottle
that
i
had
over
the
summer
this
one
is
an
instant
classic
and
worldrenowned
for
good
reason
after
a
while
the
abv
does
pop
you
in
the
jaw
but
overall
this
is
a
fun
beer
to
get
once
in
a
while
overall
a
powerful
and
sweet
bock
it
has
a
barely
noticeable
lagery
base
which
is
drowned
by
layers
of
caramel
candyfloss
and
alcohol
very
unbalanced
and
as
a
result
i
could
only
have
one
at
a
time
that
said
a
powerful
and
sweet
doppelbock
with
an
interesting
history
and
name
not
for
me
but
i
see
why
others
take
to
it
overall
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
just
one
per
week
or
month
i
think
i
will
see
if
i
can
get
another
one
and
let
is
age
a
few
years
i
will
say
if
this
beer
wasnt
aged
it
could
knock
you
on
your
ass
i
was
rather
surprised
and
i
think
i
will
finish
this
off
for
myself
d
more
than
one
probably
not
but
very
drinkable
once
you
take
the
vitals
into
consideration
everyone
should
try
this
at
least
once
overall
great
beer
im
gonna
buy
this
again
for
sure
lots
of
flavors
but
somehow
not
extreme
the
drinkability
is
good
but
really
one
or
two
of
these
will
do
you
in
if
there
is
any
beer
that
is
not
meant
to
be
sessioned
it
is
this
one
overall
this
was
sweeter
than
i
remembered
from
last
year
as
far
as
i
know
this
was
this
years
batch
so
that
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
worth
a
shot
d
this
is
a
heavy
beer
that
is
absolutely
a
sipper
the
abv
burn
is
quite
high
and
does
hurt
at
times
the
beer
is
tasty
and
interesting
but
i
dont
see
myself
having
a
larger
pour
or
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
overall
pretty
good
but
absolutely
meant
as
a
night
cap
or
an
after
dinner
drink
not
a
pounder
by
any
means
look
i
understand
and
appreciate
the
rareness
of
this
beer
but
i
really
feel
the
alcohol
level
is
just
too
over
the
top
perhaps
as
the
years
go
on
it
might
mellow
glad
i
got
to
try
it
though
overall
this
is
very
strong
and
gets
better
as
it
warms
up

a

with
a

of
sweetness
actually
its
a
bit
boozy
up
front
then
you
get
hit
with
this
ridiculous
amount
of
malty
sweetness
that
does
a
fantastic
job
hiding
the
high
abv
its
very
thick
and
full
feeling
i
would
highly
recommend
trying
this
one
at
least
once
d
surprisingly
drinkable
with
such
a
high
alcohol
content
the
sweetness
counteracts
it
strong
alcohol
would
make
it
dangerous

it

than
i
expected
from
a
beer
whit
such
a
high
abv
bubbles
are
medium
and
the
liquid
is
very
smooth
this
beer
is
dangerously
easy
to
drink
almost
makes
you
think
that
it
needs
to
have
a
warning
label
drinkablity
a
classic
boozy
but
brilliant
worth
the
trip
well
this
one
was
definitely
worth
it
and
even
better
than
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
if
you
see
this
stuff
i
would
highly
recommend
picking
it
up
if
you
are
into

dark

seemed
to
be
all
tucked
into
this
beer
hops
are
very
minor
and
completely
overshadowed
by
the
malts
but
are
there
i
couldnt
session
this
as
the
abv
and
the
fullness
of
the
beer
hit
me
with
one
8
oz
glass
other
than
that
complaint
the
flavors
are
all
over

the

would
catch
up

you
if
you
had

dark
brown

smells
a

better

tastes
a
lot

dried

alcohol
you
can
definetly
tell
its
a
sipper
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
its
not
a
summer
beer
duh
but
a
good
nightcap
and
not

or
tastebuds
but
ill
buy
it
again

bottling
poured
a
light
brown
amber
color
with
a
small
wispy
head
that
never
quite
disappears
aroma
is
very
malty
with
strong
alcoholic
winey
notes
in
the
nose
i
can
tell
from
the
smell
alone
that
this
is
going
to
be
quite
an
experience
taste
is
quite
malty
very
sweet
with
almost
a
brandylike
warming
alcoholic
note
in
each
taste
the
finish
is
also
quite
alcoholic
this
is
a
very
full
bodied
rich
beer
certainly
not
one
for
the
less
adventurous
beer
drinker
the
alcohol
is
not
hidden
at
all
so
it
pays
to
sip
on
this
one
slowly
i
remember
this
beer
being
much
darker
when
it
was
brewed
by
hurlimann
but
it
still
has
that
huge
malty
backbone
ill
probably
age
the
other
2
bottles
from
the
fourpack
several
years
to
see
how
it
matures
this
2000
version
was
graciously
provided
by
beerbeing
ooh
ps
there
may
be
a
slight
woody
finish
like
on
the
breath
a
little
very
good
overall
im
definitely
glad
to
have
tried
it
its
certainly
not
something
id
have
often
but
nice
for
every
once
and
a
while
i
let
mine
warm
to
near
room
temperature
and
that
suited
it
well
recommended
notes
what
a
find
heard
late
last
week
that
they
had
this
at
the
lionheart
and
i
knew
i
had
to
get
there
before
it
kicked
a
nice
treat
and
at
5
5
6
5
years
old
the
alcohol
seems
to
have
mellowed
a
bit
im
guessing
this
would
be
substantially
hotter
if
it
were
younger
chill
it
and
pur
it
in
shot
glasses
for
a
group
ill
pass
on
this
one
next
time
i
see
it
poured
a
crisp
deep
amber
with
minimal
head
that
diminished
to
nothing
and
left
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
relatively
weak
with
some
fruitiness
but
not
much
the
beer
was
very
rich
and
malty
somewhat
complex
but
the
syrupiness
somewhat
gets
in
the
way
the
beer
is
heavy
on
the
tongue
as
is
expected
the
alcohol
is
not
quite
as
harsh
as
i
anticipated
but
its
still
there
this
is
one
to
sip
certainly
one
i
would
not
have
that
often
while
thicker
than
some
vintage
barleywines
old
ales
ive
had
from
the
same
year
this
was
an
awesome
drink
if
you
can
get
it
or
have
it
in
your
cellar
i
would
consider
you
lucky
i
bet
this
would
be
a
heck
of
a
beer
a
few
years
down
the
road
i
may
try
it
again
but
never
this
green
novelty
only
i
cannot
stand
an
alcohol
taste
this
strong
in
a
beer
if
i
want
a
whisky
ill
have
a
whisky
sorry
kids
ok
here
we
go
ive
had
this
sitting
in
my
fridge
forever
it
is
from
the
2001
vintage
already
six
years
old
when
i
poured
it
there
was
absolutely
no
head
or
any
carbonation
to
speak
of
the
color
is
a
very
thick
looking
dark
brownishred
it
looked
like
a
glass
of
flat
coke
first
sip
just
about
took
my
breath
away
and
made
me
pass
out
i
had
the
sour
face
when
you
suck
on
a
lemon
omg
is
this
strong
and
overly
sweet
the
aroma
is
good
and
very
profound
with
strong
notes
of
figs
raisins
and
heavy
malts
the
taste
is
horrible
it
is
so
sweet
i
cannot
even
see
myself
finishing
it
flat
mouthfeel
with
no
carbonation
overpowering
abv
added
to
an
sweet
syrupy
makes
for
a
bad
combination
it
is
like
drinking
cough
syrup
i
respect
the
abv
and
its
2001
vintage
but
this
is
just
not
drinkable
at
all
i
did
notice
some
bitterness
with
each
gagging
sip
i
took
i
cant
believe
i
let
this
take
up
space
in
my
fridge
for
6
years
all
and
all
a
pretty
crappy
beer
that
i
will
pass
on
next
time
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
to
finish
the
day
with
its
been
colder
than
normal
and
it
actually
snowed
today
a
very
warm
full
bodied
mouthfeel
definitely
a
slow
sipper
the
label
gives
information
about
aging
ill
have
to
try
it
out
2004
bottle
chestnut
brown
with
a
small
creamy
white
head
aroma
of
ripe
apples
brown
sugar
plums
and
vanilla
flavor
is
bursting
with
sweet
dark
fruits
chocolate
toffee
and
i
detected
a
hint
of
tobacco
as
well
alcohol
is
tremendously
well
masked
its
detectable
but
mellows
a
lot
as
the
brew
warms
earthy
almost
scotchlike
finish
a
beautiful
beer
defiantly
worth
a
try
i
can
imagine
this
being
one
of
the
better
drinks
in
the
world
if
aged
properly
and
for
a
long
enough
time
cheers
mouthfeel
is
smooth
warming
sitcky
sweet
of
syrup
along
with
over
ripe
fruit
and
cocoa
infused
caramel
bouncing
along
the
palate
with
a
gentle
alcahol
burn
great
beer
will
be
getting
several
to
stow
away
interesting
because
i
drank
two
extremely
different
dopple
bocks
earlier
in
the
day
the
flavor
keeps
improving
over
time
and
both
the
smell
and
taste
of
alcohol
has
mellowed
down
quite
nicely
it
is
a
great
aging
beer
and
it
seems
that
around
6
years
this
is
at
its
peak
all
in
all
its
a
pretty
good
beer
a
bit
overrated
in
my
opinion
but
nonetheless
quite
drinkable
id
be
interested
to
see
how
it
mellows
over
a
few
years
drinkability
not
for
me
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
the
good
brewers
found
a
way
to
coax
this
brew
to
14
percent
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
sugary
sticky
lifeless
bore
and
the
monster
alcohol
makes
it
a
rough
go
one
and
done
samichlause
is
a
syrupy
elixir
that
is
smooth
and
easy
on
the
toungue
high
in
alcohol
but
surprisingly
drinkable
compared
to
other
somewhat
similar
styles
d
as
with
all
very
strong
beers
its
wonderful
but
not
a
session
beer
da
at
14
you
can
really
feel
an
11
2
oz
bottle
the
heat
is
rather
high
even
compared
to
the
21
dfh
120
ipa
its
flavors
are
extreme
and
it
takes
an
extreme
palate
to
really
enjoy
this
beer
this
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
i
am
very
surprised
that
this
is
so
drinkable
for
a
beer
that
tips
the
scales
at
14
abv
this
manages
to
hide
the
alcohol
pretty
well
i
think
ill
wait
a
year
or
so
before
drinking
another
one
of
these
just
to
see
what
some
age
does
to
this
overall
a
very
different
and
very
intense
strong
ale
if
i
am
going
to
drink
something
like
this
i
prefer
averys
samaels
ale
with
its
wonderful
oakiness
this
is
like
samael
without
the
oakaged
flavor
not
bad
at
all
but
not
necessarily
worth
it
and
literally
impossible
to
find
in
my
area
fairly
drinkable
for
something
at
14
but
definitely
something
to
sip
savor
and
enjoy
well
this
will
definitely
become
part
of
my
cold
weather
beer
adventures
ive
read
it
cellars
very
well
which
i
will
have
to
try
definitely
seek
this
one
out
and
give
it
a
shot
the
second
time
ive
sampled
this
beer
originally
it
was
a
2003
and
i
wasnt
all
that
impressed
the
beer
seemed
to
be
too
sweet
too
one
dimensional
in
terms
of
flavour
and
a
little
overwhelming
as
far
as
the
alcohol
character
is
concerned
it
might
be
my
palette
developing
or
the
year
itself
but
i
have
come
round
to
this
beer
i
still
think
that
the
sweetness
is
a
little
bit
excessive
and
it
could
have
perhaps
benefited
from
some
form
of
balancing
but
i
suppose
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
a
malt
monster
and
a
malty
beer
especially
a
lager
brewed
to
14
is
going
to
be
pretty
heavy
on
the
sweetness
i
definatly
enjoyed
this
beer
alot
more
this
time
serving
it
at
room
temperature
seems
to
bring
out
alot
more
depth
in
the
flavour
but
it
does
push
the
alcohol
to
the
forefront
to
some
degree
anyways
one
of
those
beers
everyone
should
try
at
least
once
i
have
a
2005
cellaring
at
the
minute
and
hope
that
maybe
over
time
it
will
improve
and
develop
further
smells
like
sugar
booze
cheries
licorice
cat
piss
and
toffee
tastes
a
bit
like
a
strong
mead
loaded
with
candy
sugar
syrupy
body
very
sweet
seriously
disgustingly
sweet
the
abv
may
be
partially
covered
but
the
sugar
sure
as
hell
isnt
lots
of
cherry
taste
but
most
other
flavors
are
hard
to
distinguish
because
my
tongue
is
burning
from
the
sweetness
it
makes
me
sick
to
my
stomach
and
hurts
my
throat
my
body
rejects
this
as
foul
i
take
no
pleasure
in
this
mess
although
it
has
a
really
really
pretty
chestnut
body
with
reddish
hues
though
no
head
whatsoever
i
think
this
might
be
a
lot
better
after
a
decade
in
a
cellar
chewy
toffee
and
port
notes
in
the
flavor
i
aged
mine
for
five
years
creamy
body
with
a
mild
sherrylike
finish
the
aroma
was
a
musty
and
faint
duplicate
of
the
flavor
and
finish
this
is
a
very
fine
after
dinner
beer
cigar
pipe
by
the
fire
i
had
mine
after
dinner
by
the
fire
with
some
creme
brulee
wonderful
2005
samichlaus
pours
a
clear
amber
with
no
head
just
a
delicate
white
lacing
around
the
top
smell
is
sweet
malt
with
rich
and
fruity
raisin
and
toffee
aroma
taste
is
a
huge
malty
sweetness
with
incredible
complexity
much
more
rich
and
syrupy
without
being
overly
thick
alcohol
is
apparent
definitely
a
burn
towards
the
end
but
at
14
i
would
say
well
hidden
hops
are
hiding
as
well
as
expected
carbonation
is
slightly
more
than
i
expected
after
the
lack
of
head
in
the
pour
just
enough
i
think
i
wish
i
had
the
cash
to
drink
this
one
more
often
alll
of
the
alcohol
and
sweetness
really
bring
down
the
drinkablility
overall
its
a
decent
doppelbock
adam
on
a
side
note
this
is
an
interesting
beer
which
i
would
suggest
at
least
giving
a
try
sometime

if
only
for
curiositys
sake
i
was
very
fortunate
to
have
this
beer
on
tap
at
summits
in
sandy
springs
before
it
closed
this
is
a
monster
of
a
double
bock
at
14
abv
i
drank
this
from
a
small
sampler
style
glass
the
color
is
a
deep
rubyred
brown
with
virtually
no
head
however
there
was
a
small
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
deep
and
malty
and
you
can
smell
the
ephemeral
alcohol
quality
to
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
heavy
flat
low
carbonation
and
a
bit
slick
it
has
a
good
taste
malty
and
sweet
maybe
a
bit
of
raisin
and
chocolate
however
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
strange
at
14
you
would
expect
most
of
the
sugar
to
be
gone
that
is
unless
its
nonfermentable
i
like
it
but
i
dont
think
i
could
go
beyond
more
that
one
in
a
sitting
this
is
a
decent
doppelbock
very
rich
sweet
and
intense
it
tastes
less
boozey
than
malt
liquors
half
its
gravity
bottled
in
2004
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
the
samichlaus
pours
a
clear
ambercopper
color
with
a
small
white
head
it
smells
sweet
like
caramel
malt
some
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
it
tastes
like
raisins
figs
toffee
caramel
and
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
in
the
beer
but
its
not
overwhelming
this
is
a
very
malty
beer
i
cant
taste
any
hops
at
all
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
its
smooth
and
a
bit
oily
drinkability
is
good
but
it
doesnt
take
too
long
for
the
alcohol
to
catch
up
to
you
with
this
beer
i
wouldnt
drink
anymore
than
one
of
these
a
night
but
i
would
definitely
buy
the
beer
again
syrupy
sweet
my
tongue
is
enveloped
in
a
viscous
blanket
of
carmelized
sugar
a
faint
nuttiness
is
apparent
upon
aerating
as
is
a
hot
burn
from
the
14
abv
this
is
a
one
trick
pony
right
now
and
too
hot
with
alcohol
to
boot
im
going
to
let
this
one
settle
for
a
while
and
revisit
later
hopefully
with
a
more
favorable
review
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
would
have
a
hard
time
drinking
it
too
often
its
quite
extreme
as
far
as
doppelbocks
go
the
malty
sweet
flavors
are
very
strong
as
is
the
alcohol
poured
from
an
11
2oz
bottle
labelled
as
2005
edition
the
beer
was
dark
burnt
copper
color
with
almost
no
head
the
aroma
was
stong
and
hinted
at
an
asskicking
from
alcohol
the
taste
confirmed
it
this
beer
tore
my
head
off
and
crapped
down
my
throat
it
was
way
strong
with
alcohol
but
extremely
sweet
at
the
same
time
the
mixture
of
sweet
and
burn
made
me
pucker
with
each
sip
a
very
strange
and
interesting
dopplebock
but
not
easydrinking
enough
to
recommend
served
in
a
tulip
glass
ontap
at
romans
in
milwaukee
appearance
is
a
cocoa
brown
with
a
minimal
amount
of
head
aroma
is
maltiness
with
a
ton
of
alcohol
esters
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
this
beer
is
very
malty
but
also
at
14
abv
has
a
ton
of
alcohol
punch
it
tasted
to
me
as
if
someone
distilled
a
spaten
optimator
mouthfeel
is
astringent
and
this
beer
made
me
want
to
pucker
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
couldnt
get
over
how
outintheopen
its
alcohol
character
is
d
the
malts
in
this
are
way
to
over
powering
it
isnt
to
tasty
or
easy
to
drink
not
impressed
with
this
at
all
many
thanks
to
beerbeing
for
shipping
this
treat
on
the
final
leg
of
my
no
bs
bif
poured
into
a
chalice
virtually
no
head
comes
out
of
an
aggresive
pour
but
the
color
is
a
gorgeous
clear
ruby
red
almost
like
cognac
ripe
grape
is
the
first
scent
that
hits
the
nose
followed
by
alcohol
sweetness
maybe
a
little
caramel
or
toffee
taste
is
sweet
very
sweet
actually
and
big
on
malt
theres
some
dark
fruit
and
vanilla
here
too
very
complex
and
delicious
mouthfeel
is
thickchewy
slight
carbonation
gives
this
another
dimension
theres
a
slight
alcohol
burn
but
i
think
14
is
hidden
well
here
however
this
is
a
sipper
no
need
to
gulp
this
down
savor
every
last
drop
highest
recommendation
i
definitely
recommend
this
one
for
the
winter
holidays
one
of
these
is
all
i
could
tolerate
in
a
sitting
its
quite
tasty
but
it
is
still
a
very
assertive
beer
not
bad
at
all
but
while
im
very
glad
i
tried
it
i
wont
be
rushing
out
to
buy
it
again
anytime
soon
not
sure
if
ill
get
this
one
again
though
im
sure
itll
grow
on
be
as
it
warms
and
id
love
to
see
what
this
one
would
be
like
after
a
few
years
of
aging
pours
an
amber
color
with
some
head
not
too
much
and
doesnt
leave
much
if
any
lacing
although
i
didnt
expect
it
to
with
the
kind
of
abv
it
has
smells
of
raisins
cherry
sweet
malts
and
alcohol
very
sweet
tasting
beer
that
is
high
on
extremely
sugary
malts
a
little
bit
of
hop
flavor
tucked
away
in
there
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
a
currant
flavor
a
little
oily
and
im
not
sure
id
be
able
to
drink
more
than
one
it
claims
to
be
the
worlds
most
extraordinary
beer
i
dont
think
id
go
that
far
but
it
is
a
nice
beer
and
works
great
as
a
nightcap
its
got
an
extremely
warming
feeling
afterwards
something
i
just
noticed
the
bottle
im
drinking
is
2
years
cellared
so
im
quite
impressed
on
how
this
has
held
up
even
though
i
dont
have
a
reference
point
for
it
d
it
is
absurbly
strong
and
not
that
good
i
will
pass
in
the
future
not
a
chore
to
finish
though
not
really
worth
seeking
out
a
must
try
on
tap
but
a
mustnot
drive
home
afterwards
served
in
a
brandy
sniffer
at
my
local
pizza
pub
the
beer
came
out
with
a
mild
fine
carbonation
and
a
light
trace
of
foam
atop
a
very
pale
golden
copper
color
and
crystal
clear
the
viscocity
evident
with
a
magnifying
effect
through
the
glass
and
shows
heavy
legging
aromas
of
heavy
syrupy
malts
ripe
fruits
figs
dates
and
pears
with
a
light
nuttiness
and
strong
maple
syrup
lightly
buttery
oily
and
very
sweet
the
feel
is
very
warm
nearly
hot
alcohols
and
a
light
tingle
to
the
whole
mouth
numbing
upon
impact
good
beer
and
a
nice
variety
from
the
bottle
d
so
very
slow
only
one
in
a
night
not
to
say
i
wont
get
it
again
but
two
of
these
would
be
too
many
this
was
bottled
in
2006
making
this
only
a
month
old
which
is
most
certainly
the
youngest
samichlaus
i
have
ever
run
across
the
new
bottle
had
a
small
picture
of
an
old
man
who
i
presume
to
be
st
nicholas
himself
poured
into
a
stem
glass
the
beer
looked
orange
amber
and
crystal
clear
and
formed
a
small
but
durable
head
thanks
to
the
active
carbonation
smelled
riotously
spicy
and
spirituous
and
gave
a
good
indication
of
the
sweetness
to
follow
tasted
sweet
as
ever
but
there
was
balance
in
here
in
the
form
of
alcohol
heat
and
dryness
and
a
peppery
spiciness
pretty
much
puts
an
end
to
any
night
once
opened
i
have
a
few
older
vintages
aging
but
when
i
start
a
vertical
comparison
ill
probably
have
to
open
both
bottles
early
in
the
evening
and
have
to
sip
on
them
for
a
long
time
better
make
sure
the
wife
is
not
around
and
the
checkbook
is
locked
up
in
a
safe
that
night
amber
reddish
color
with
a
white
head
which
disappeared
in
a
few
minutes
odors
are
redolent
of
sweet
ripe
fruits
sweet
malt
accents
predominate
with
a
subtle
hop
background
14
alcohol
is
not
evident
in
the
flavor
an
achievement
in
itself
a
great
beer
one
i
was
lucky
to
find
the
perfect
winter
nightcap
and
dessert
beer
definitely
a
sipping
beer
drinkability
is
limited
by
the
abv
but
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
beer
whenever
i
get
the
chance
bottled
in
2005
14
abv
brewed
once
a
year
on
126
then
aged
for
10
months
before
bottling
poured
into
a
snifter
with
a
rush
of
carbonation
orangecopper
in
color
with
a
white
fizzy
head
that
disappeared
immediately
not
suprising
for
a
beast
of
a
beer
big
alcohol
in
the
nose
along
with
sugar
coated
dark
ripe
fruit
very
warming
and
almost
overly
sweet
thick
almost
syrupy
with
little
carbonation
left
loads
of
fruit
flavors
creamy
the
flavor
that
stuck
out
would
be
described
as
syrup
covered
oranges
a
huge
beer
certainly
a
sipper
some
yeasty
flavors
come
out
as
it
warms
a
world
classic
sure
but
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
just
drink
it
slowly
to
appreciate
all
the
subtles
in
it
pours
a
perfectly
clear
dark
amber
the
aromas
are
of
heavy
sweet
malt
and
honey
a
note
of
cinammon
at
the
end
the
taste
is
of
sweet
alcohol
up
front
followed
by
an
explosion
of
spices
underpinned
by
a
rich
warmth
of
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
soy
the
mouthfeel
is
like
the
nectar
of
the
gods
very
sweet
but
pure
and
light
not
sticky
at
all
very
good
drinkability
but
the
sweet
intensity
and
alcohol
merit
stopping
at
one
really
a
delicious
beer
that
really
hasnt
lost
much
by
its
transfer
across
the
alps
coppery
to
medium
golden
brown
in
color
no
head
but
a
decent
carbonation
level
sweet
caramel
aroma
buttery
and
toffeeish
somewhat
winey
huge
huge
sweet
malty
flavor
like
sucking
on
a
soft
caramel
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
i
chalk
that
up
to
the
alcohol
more
then
anything
else
slighly
oakey
and
somewhat
wiskey
like
in
the
flavor
very
full
body
has
a
slight
buzzing
effect
on
the
tongue
dangerously
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
between
the
syrupy
sweetness
and
the
high
abv
i
dont
know
how
many
you
would
want
in
a
sitting
but
a
damn
fine
and
unigue
beer
2005
bottling
pours
extrememly
clear
and
clean
brown
not
dark
or
cloudy
in
the
least
very
strangelooking
nose
is
just
a
ton
of
alcohol
with
maybe
some
grape
and
other
vague
fruit
odors
taste
is
also
ton
of
alcohol
which
totally
dominate
the
flavor
i
really
didnt
find
it
all
that
complex
some
fruitiness
as
in
the
nose
but
not
much
very
thick
and
syrupy
kind
of
like
drinking
whisky
mixed
with
beer
a
sipper
if
i
had
to
drink
it
again
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
drinkability
is
hurt
by
the
abv
still
carbonated
phew
this
wellaged
sample
poured
a
rich
brown
color
almost
like
watery
milk
chocolate
a
small
brown
head
forms
and
then
quickly
dissipates
aroma
is
very
very
rich
full
of
caramel
figs
rum
raisin
and
more
sip
is
smooth
and
warm
like
a
fine
brandy
rich
supple
creamy
and
slick
with
big
caramelized
flavors
of
fig
and
rum
warm
and
sumptuous
with
just
enough
hops
left
to
tickle
the
tongue
very
good
im
impressed
by
how
well
this
has
stood
up
over
time
d
this
beer
aged
is
a
different
beast
than
a
young
subject
with
some
age
this
beer
is
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
simply
delicious
my
first
bottle
and
i
may
edit
this
review
as
a
first
impression
its
pretty
unique
and
odd
definitely
a
sipper
i
want
to
propagate
my
cellar
with
lots
and
lots
of
this
brew
drinkability
i
never
tasted
the
original
so
i
cannot
compare
but
this
elixir
is
mighty
impressive
kind
of
a
dopplebock
cum
barleywine
it
is
well
worth
seeking
out
but
you
have
to
know
what
you
are
getting
into
if
you
dont
like
after
dinner
liqueur
such
as
cointreau
or
drambuie
you
are
not
going
to
like
this
i
didnt
realize
that
this
was
a
malt
beverage
of
14
abv
this
was
brought
out
w
the
bottle
and
a
mug
i
poured
it
into
the
mug
and
it
had
absolutely
no
head
at
all
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
a
brown
color
w
bubbles
smell
is
of
sugar
cane
and
mollasses
the
taste
is
simply
ok
but
the
alcohol
bite
is
extreme
you
can
taste
every
bit
of
the
alcohol
in
this
one
it
goes
down
warm
like
a
bourbon
and
has
a
similar
taste
w
more
of
a
sweetness
to
it
it
is
cold
outside
so
it
warms
you
quick
hard
to
drink
many
of
these
though
2005
version
pours
very
still
with
no
head
but
a
slight
stream
of
bubbles
floating
upward
and
a
body
the
color
of
hot
diluted
molasses
big
aroma
that
screams
sweetness
hot
alcohol
candied
fruits
raw
sugar
big
sweetness
up
front
sugared
oranges
caramel
berry
fruits
and
a
touch
of
malt
bitterness
rounded
out
by
hot
alcohol
creamy
mouthfeel
with
almost
no
carbonation
and
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
that
present
alcohol
is
the
one
part
to
take
away
from
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
for
a
brew
of
14
this
is
suprisingly
smooth
and
drinkable
overall
this
brew
is
pretty
great
huge
alcohol
huge
tastes
definitely
something
to
be
savored
and
paired
with
food
its
only
real
flaw
is
the
present
alcohol
which
can
be
overlooked
drinkability
is
one
a
year
its
a
huge
beer
cleaner
than
a
barleywine
but
also
suffering
from
yeast
defects
and
underhoppiness
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
sipping
beer
goes
down
best
when
it
fills
your
mouth
soaking
every
sense
of
your
palate
i
want
to
get
another
of
the
same
or
older
vintage
and
age
it
longer
this
is
one
which
can
only
get
better
with
time
a
very
well
crafted
strong
lager
not
very
gulpable
though
sampled
at
sams
a
week
ago
and
thought
it
might
be
fun
to
try
after
thanks
giving
dinner
with
a
buddy
poured
into
a
flute
none
aggressive
head
the
color
was
a
wonderful
purple
brown
rust
color
nose
was
strong
barely
presence
with
definite
yet
pleasing
alcohol
scents
sort
of
earthy
or
barn
yard
like
even
having
little
experience
with
doppelbock
the
closest
thing
i
could
think
of
was
barley
wine
which
to
me
has
a
similar
smell
i
found
it
a
little
hard
to
drink
at
first
but
as
it
warmed
up
both
the
scent
and
taste
became
much
more
accessible
this
is
defiantly
worth
a
try
not
something
id
drink
often
though
i
bought
two
so
one
is
going
in
my
cellar
till
next
year
see
you
then
samichlaus
im
planning
a
samichlaus
clone
to
be
brewed
in
january
i
hope
i
can
come
close
to
the
original
d
at
14
this
is
no
pounder
one
as
a
nightcap
is
more
than
enough
drinks
pretty
easy
considering
the
abv
i
can
discern
no
difference
between
this
the
hurliman
version
from
back
in
the
day
when
this
was
the
strongest
bier
in
the
world
got
to
try
just
for
the
sake
of
repsecting
the
extemism
the
original
triplebock
poured
into
a
stein
its
a
nice
looking
reddish
brown
beer
but
clear
not
at
all
cloudy
not
much
carbonation
and
almost
no
head
at
all
the
nose
is
a
combination
of
alcohol
spice
nuttiness
and
a
touch
of
cereal
or
bread
the
flavor
is
a
bit
much
initially
the
nose
translates
directly
to
the
palate
overwhelming
nutbread
and
alcohol
flavor
which
is
folowed
up
with
a
syrupy
sweet
aftertaste
which
is
just
too
much
and
not
unlike
brandy
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
thick
and
syrupy
as
well
they
just
took
this
beer
too
far
its
not
the
high
abv
either
its
as
if
they
fermented
maple
syrup
and
bottled
it
im
not
a
big
fan
of
doppelbocks
but
this
is
definitely
my
least
favorite
thusfar
ill
give
it
another
shot
a
year
from
now
and
see
if
it
improves
but
at
this
point
its
not
a
recommended
purchase
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
its
strength
makes
it
hard
for
me
to
finish
a
bottel
without
much
help
the
drinkability
of
this
14
abv
brew
is
unsurpassed
this
is
a
master
brew
prosit
und
zum
wohl
mk
this
one
has
potential
and
i
will
cellar
the
other
two
i
have
for
a
couple
of
years
before
revisiting
this
beer
young
a
year
old
or
less
its
pretty
2
dimensional
but
still
i
like
the
flavor
better
than
many
young
barley
wines
and
imperials
ive
tried
while
i
really
did
enjoy
this
i
think
it
would
have
been
better
to
wait
awhile
a
very
intriguing
beer
edit
after
bringing
this
beer
around
to
various
tasters
i
decided
to
give
it
another
go
and
i
actually
find
it
palatable
but
still
nothing
exciting
d
drinkability
isnt
great
but
overall
this
is
excellent
and
will
be
revisited
on
many
occasions
d
i
cant
say
this
is
an
easy
thing
to
drink
its
worth
a
try
if
you
are
into
big
malty
beers
but
not
something
i
would
get
again
i
really
cant
stand
how
much
it
remind
me
of
cough
syrup
im
starting
to
doubt
im
going
to
be
able
to
finish
it
though
i
really
dont
want
to
waste
something
so
damn
expensive
over
five
bucks
for
a
12oz
bottle
maybe
if
i
had
a
cough
to
cure
i
poured
out
a
2005
vintage
and
was
surprised
by
the
amount
of
carbonation
its
copper
clear
and
formed
a
small
head
and
then
disapated
quickly
in
my
tulip
bulb
glass
taste
was
amazing
hints
of
rasin
rum
port
and
molasis
ginger
cookies
the
mouthfeel
is
thickermore
syrupy
than
most
dopplebocks
due
to
the
high
sugars
which
give
it
the
14
alcohol
rating
its
definately
a
sipper
i
goes
well
with
a
night
of
surfing
the
net
drinkability
is
a
little
harsh
with
the
alcohol
burn
but
this
is
the
very
reason
i
like
this
beer
this
was
bottled
in
05
so
i
gues
you
milage
might
vary
but
i
liked
this
my
only
knock
on
it
is
the
lack
of
carbonation
reddish

at

this
is
hardly
a
session
beer
its
certainly
worth
drinking
because
you
can
see
the
potential
that
it
has
if
allowed
to
age
for
a
while
this
is
one
of
those
beers
id
like
to
start
buying
12
or
so
of
each
year
and
drinking
one
of
each
vintage
each
year
overall
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
at
14
abv
even
an
11
2oz
bottle
could
be
trouble
depending
on
hydration
level
and
stomach
contents
the
alcohol
though
evident
is
not
overpowering
and
you
could
get
sodded
real
fast
if
you
werent
paying
attention
nonetheless
this
is
an
amazing
and
complex
beer
a
pinnacle
of
achievement
for
eggenberg
and
for
brewing
in
general
i
cannot
wait
to
try
the
other
three
bottles
in
the
coming
years
as
aging
will
only
increase
the
splendor
of
this
already
majestic
brew
d
not
very
drinkable
although
the
taste
is
strangly
addicitive
the
ultra
heavy
mouthfeel
and
crazy
syrupyness
of
this
beer
really
take
off
major
points
very
small
sips
as
if
i
was
sampling
a
brandy
or
cognac
again
this
should
not
be
presented
in
a
12oz
bottle
i
would
love
to
see
this
come
in
those
little
airline
alcohol
bottles
what
are
they
one
or
two
fl
ounce
yeah
i
would
dig
that
overall
i
guess
this
is
the
beer
that
finally
made
me
stop
making
comments
like
good
within
style
or
atypical
of
style

samichlaus
is
supposed
to
be
a
dopplebock
but
to
me
its
much
more
similar
to
a
strong
dark
or
a
quadrupel
who
cares
its
a
great
beer
highly
recommended
this
beer
is
thick
but
on
a
cold
night
it
will
do
you
right
any
beverage
that
claims
to
be
the
worlds
most
extraordinary
beer
desereves
much
closer
scrutiny
than
most
although
the
picture
of
the
brewery
that
ba
has
seems
to
be
reason
enough
to
earn
its
name
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
and
smells
like
malt
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
interesting
very
heavy
on
the
alcohol
not
surprising
with
14
there
is
a
syrupy
consistancy
as
it
goes
down
and
it
coats
the
inside
of
your
mouth
for
a
while
i
dont
much
like
it
as
the
alcohol
is
very
apparent
in
this
but
then
again
its
not
my
fav
kind
of
beer
for
those
who
love
big
beers
that
you
can
only
have
one
at
a
time
this
is
for
you
drinkability
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
but
really
unbalanced
for
a
bock
beer
the
alcohol
flattens
malt
development
and
characteristic
sweetness
a
real
winter
warmer
if
thats
your
thing
but
one
was
enough
for
me
the
overemphasis
on
the
alcohol
probably
means
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
any
time
soom
pours
an
attractive
enough
fiery
amber
with
nary
a
head
not
surprising
at
14
nose
is
slightly
metallic
upfront
with
notes
of
apple
skinscider
caramel
and
a
whole
lot
of
booze
taste
is
intensely
potent
on
the
forepalate
supersweet
vinous
and
caramel
malt
finishing
with
nothing
but
hangoverworthy
booze
mouthfeel
is
thick
rich
and
slick
with
medium
carbonation
so
thick
that
the
flavor
lingers
in
your
mouth
indefinitely
this
is
an
intense
beer
but
it
lacks
any
semblance
of
subltety
or
balance
even
as
it
warms
just
a
sugarbooze
bomb
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
dont
see
myself
seeking
it
out
again
doesnt
drink
too
easy
but
not
particularly
difficult
the
bartender
lady
made
me
try
a
sample
before
she
poured
a
full
glass
to
make
sure
i
didnt
send
it
back
must
not
be
too
popular
well
i
finished
it
mofo
woot
woot
oh
hold
up
where
am
i
dude
wherewhere
am
i
on
tap
at
the
dirty
truth
a
rich
cherry
pour
with
very
little
head
smell
is
great
its
a
combination
of
cherries
molasses
and
brandy
taste
follows
suit
cherries
molasses
with
a
great
slightly
dry
hop
finish
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
alcohol
is
high
but
not
overly
pronounced
a
great
wellcrafted
brew
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
in
all
weather
in
my
opinion
but
most
people
think
it
must
be
a
christmas
seasonal
it
would
be
good
for
a
christmas
warmer
but
i
still
like
it
all
times
of
the
year
d
no
this
is
not
a
beer
for
casually
chugging
or
as
a
session
beer
use
it
as
a
dessert
beer
or
with
hardy
robust
dishes
or
as
a
digestif
this
was
an
interesting
beer
experience
but
now
i
can
say
been
there
done
that
and
wont
do
it
again
dark
brown
color
very
little
head
on
this
one
the
malt
sweetness
is
easily
the
most
distinct
flavor
here
there
are
some
dark
fruit
flavors
that
add
to
the
complexity
but
its
all
about
the
sugary
sweetness
add
in
the
ridiculous
amount
of
alcohol
and
this
is
one
truly
potent
beer
too
sweet
for
my
particular
tastes
but
if
you
appreciate
maltbombs
like
this
youre
sure
to
enjoy
this
one
it
is
certainly
a
sipping
beer
more
than
a
session
brew
it
had
the
texture
of
a
fine
cognac
i
have
a
2005
vintage
stored
away
wonder
how
long
i
can
hold
off
sweet
strong
yet
tasty
the
body
is
rather
heavy
with
a
smooth
and
warming
mouthfeel
thats
easily
consumed
sip
on
this
one
its
a
heavyweight
that
demands
respect
whew
14
the
strongest
beer
ive
ever
tried
i
honestly
cant
tell
much
of
a
difference
between
this
and
several
that
ive
had
that
have
been
of
a
lesser
abv
yes
its
high
octane
but
i
could
easily
drink
one
or
two
any
time
the
next
step
for
me
whats
available
to
order
in
japan
samuel
adams
triple
bock
this
is
pretty
rough
around
the
edges
but
beneath
all
the
alcohol
it
seems
like
this
would
shape
up
quite
nicely
with
a
few
more
years
of
age
bottom
line
this
is
a
great
brew
to
nurse
in
the
cold
winter
months
so
why
am
i
reviewing
it
in
may
because
i
didnt
review
it
the
other
times
i
had
it
i
would
suggest
this
beer
to
be
enjoyed
with
a
cigar
for
the
flavors
it
would
impart
to
the
tobacco
would
be
heavenly
savor
it
and
share
it
with
someone
who
values
complexity
and
depth
in
a
good
drink
do
what
you
have
to
do
to
find
this
and
try
it
on
your
own
explanations
from
me
or
anyone
else
are
simply
pointless
get
it
sit
down
put
on
your
favorite
tunes
and
enjoy
purchased
an
11
2oz
bottle
from
big
cs
liquor
store
for
4

what
caught
my
eye
is
the
proclaimed
worlds
most
extraordinary
beer
on
the
front
of
the
bottle
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
not
much
carbonation
or
head
smell
is
sweet
fruit
and
alcohol
taste
is
very
sweet
and
fruity
and
a
bit
syrupy
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
this
beer
dangerously
hides
the
14
alcohol
that
is
present
overall
i
like
this
beer
i
wish
i
had
someone
to
share
the
bottle
with
though
because
it
will
be
difficult
to
finish
it
all
by
myself
due
to
the
high
abv
definitely
a
sipping
beer
worth
trying
and
recommended
d
this
beer
is
the
closest
thing
i
have
experienced
to
sipping
bourbon
with
a
splash
of
water
it
has
the
same
consistency
with
a
slight
alcohol
bite
a
nice
beer
but
at
14
it
is
definitely
a
sipper
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
caramel
color
with
thin
dissapating
head
gorgeous
aromas
are
very
sherry
like
lots
of
alcohol
caramel
maltiness
dried
fruits
a
little
smoky
this
brew
goes
down
incredibly
sweet
starting
out
with
the
heavy
alcoholic
dose
syrupy
medium
carbonation
raisiny
almost
toostie
roll
chocolate
my
half
bottle
will
be
enjoyed
but
is
plenty
bottled
in
2004
perhaps
too
new
purchased
from
big
ten
liquor
mart
in
ann
arbor
a
couple
years
back
and
aged
in
my
cellar
since
that
time
pours
a
soda
pop
onefinger
head
that
is
gone
in
moments
crystal
clear
dark
copper
liquid
smelled
very
fruity
estery
during
the
pour
to
the
nose
it
smells
likely
sherry
cherry
alcohol
soured
fruity
esters
mostly
raisin
but
some
tamarind
and
way
beneath
a
hint
of
german
malts
tastes
brandy
cherry
sour
clean
alcohol
sting
leading
to
an
aftertaste
thats
caramel
wet
sweet
rich
malt
with
a
warming
alcohol
whoa
i
would
never
have
anticipated
the
delicious
aftertaste
after
the
rather
unpleasant
first
impression
yeah
definitely
some
german
bock
character
but
it
comes
across
as
soured
because
of
the
potency
of
the
alcohol
thick
body
that
passes
over
the
tongue
essentially
no
carbonation
but
a
nice
alcohol
sting
hangs
around
when
i
would
normally
expect
tiny
carb
bubbles
to
form
on
my
tongue
in
the
aftertaste
i
find
this
one
a
very
drinkable
beer
maybe
a
little
too
drinkable
considering
the
high
alcohol
content
not
bad
certainly
a
beer
to
sip
on
a
special
occasion
drinkability
is
decent
i
feel
considering
one
and
youre
done
but
overall
a
very
unique
beer
and
not
too
bad
either
liquid
candy
with
the
gentlemanly
sipping
quality
of
a
wellaged
whisky
lets
be
honest
its
not
a
daily
beer
but
for
special
occasions
especially
in
the
winter
months
choosing
this
one
would
exhibit
exceptional
taste
gives
a
hellish
buzz
too
its
no
surprise
i
guess
that
this
beer
is
brewed
in
a
castle
drinkability
a
delicious
dessert
beer
aged
5
years
is
just
about
perfect
id
say
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
is
a
very
high
nitro
alcohol
beer
the
beer
is
full
bodied
the
beer
is
a
sipping
beer
owing
to
high
nitro
alcohol
and
thick
sweetness
this
beer
would
be
good
for
sharing
with
others
very
warming
it
would
be
the
kind
of
beer
to
sit
around
the
fire
after
a
day
of
skiing
but
ill
enjoy
it
again
just
sitting
around
a
campfire
always
great
to
let
this
one
age
a
bit
if
you
can
mouthfeel
a
semisyrupy
yet
over
warming
and
sweet
palate
that
makes
a
good
driven
balance
down
the
throat
in
any
case
i
guess
it
is
beer
doesnt
look
taste
smell
or
act
like
a
dopplebock
however
pours
a
strong
gold
with
powerful
carbonation
going
nuts
throughout
the
glass
the
beer
really
is
a
bit
too
sweet
it
could
use
a
stronger
malt
presence
to
balance
it
out
an
interesting
experience
but
not
one
that
i
would
want
to
have
every
day
2002
bottling
strong
malt
notes
with
a
big
alcohol
smell
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
amber
colored
headless
i
even
busted
out
some
chocolate
cake
for
this
isnt
helping
the
flavor
any
i
had
the
old
version
in
high
school
and
while
it
was
long
ago
it
was
an
important
moment
in
my
life
and
i
remember
it
being
more
rich
and
darker
still
some
interesting
flavors
here
fruits
apple
pear
nuts
and
of
course
alcohol
kinda
a
sugary
liquor
when
you
get
down
to
it
nowadays
there
are
many
beers
with
this
level
of
alcohol
that
handle
it
a
lot
better
looks
dark
nutbrown
teh
reputation
gets
in
my
head
and
im
sucked
into
saying
this
is
good
enough
of
a
look
to
merit
a
smelling
rich
thick
malty
smell
with
a
hint
of
spice
taste
like
a
super
strong
belgian
mimics
smell
huge
warming
feeling
lacks
bitterness
only
the
mouthfeel
is
more
like
port
fairly
drinkable
between
a
portlike
beer
sam
adams
utopia
and
a
strong
belgian
youll
finish
the
bottle
no
sweat
overall
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
this
one
used
to
scare
the
bajesus
but
now
i
can
handle
it
with
quite
an
enjoyment
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
still
a
great
and
appreciated
beer
drinkability
isnt
bad
but
cleary
affected
by
the
huge
abv
overall
im
pretty
impressed
its
unlike
any
lager
ive
ever
had
before
the
bottle
says
malt
liquor
and
honestly
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
bourbon
or
scotch
and
id
much
prefer
this
over
any
of
those
its
up
in
the
air
whether
id
order
anymore
of
these
online
or
not
but
its
definitely
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
given
a
better
opportunity
to
do
so
way
way
way
too
sweat
for
my
taste
but
i
rather
enjoyed
drinking
it
simply
for
what
it
is
brewed
only
one
day
a
year
december
6
with
a
secondary
fermentation
of
10
months
this
beer
is
something
that
should
be
respected
and
appreciated
for
what
it
is
overall
im
definitely
glad
i
tried
this
i
had
heard
that
it
is
extremely
rare
but
i
stumbled
across
around
20
bottles
on
the
lower
shelf
of
bevmo
in
san
diego
hiding
behind
a
few
stacked
cases
of
wersteiner
if
you
think
your
palate
is
capable
give
this
a
try
this
is
a
brew
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
but
with
a
14
abv
i
figured
caution
would
be
in
order
would
be
really
great
as
a
nightcap
i
couldnt
drink
much
of
this
but
then
you
dont
have
to
a
really
nice
warmer
for
a
cold
winner
day
a
beer
for
snow
shovelers
actually
this
would
be
great
after
dinner
either
with
desert
or
just
to
sip
definitely
a
classic
though
not
a
typical
dopplebock
more
like
an
example
of
just
how
strong
that
style
can
get
nevertheless
a
real
treat
and
while
far
from
a
session
beer
something
every
serious
craft
beer
lover
should
try
highly
recommended
a
complex
beer
that
falls
just
a
bit
short
for
my
taste
but
still
an
excellent
and
special
product
could
not
imagine
myself
having
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
a
nice
way
to
cap
the
holiday
season
cheers
enjoyable
to
try
this
classic
on
tap
at
ludwigs

cloudy

a

world
class
nightcappersipper
on
tap
at
brouwers
cafe
in
seattle
main
differences
i
noted
between
the
draft
version
and
the
bottle
i
reviewed
earlier
is
that
the
mouthfeel
is
improved
out
of
the
tap
some
of
the
overly
syrupy
texture
gives
way
to
a
tiny
bit
of
carbonation
that
makes
this
a
bit
more
drinkable
just
stood
up
after
drinking
this
one
woah
you
can
feel
the
14
abv
and
im
pretty
sure
i
felt
the
alcohol
move
around
in
my
stomach
lol
while
drinking
this
my
friend
and
i
coined
the
phrase
self
regulating
sipper

there
is
just
no
way
that
this
beer
can
be
taken
quickly
this
is
an
awesome
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
could
ever
have
more
than
one
theres
a
bit
of
a
nip
from
the
alcohol
but
its
welcome
at
the
very
end
of
the
day
as
the
bottle
claims
it
is
quite
an
extraordinary
beer
d
approachable
but
its
strength
is
inhibitive
it
was
worth
trying
this
bad
boy
to
get
an
idea
for
it
but
i
like
a
beer
to
exhibit
some
complexity
or
interesting
notes
the
worlds
strangest
beer
is
tough
to
get
down
maybe
longer
aging
makes
for
a
more
wellrounded
experience
not
recommended
toffee
and
coffee
yeah
theyre
there
figs
i
cant
even
describe
it
words
dont
do
it
justice
the
worlds
strongets
lager
well
you
have
to
taste
it
iit
poured
with
very
little
foam
and
a
red
amber
color
the
smell
was
of
fruits
and
candy
it
tasted
very
sweet
and
fruity
almost
like
some
kind
of
thin
syrup
an
alcohol
burn
in
the
throat
this
beer
needs
the
right
manwoman
to
be
appreciated
im
sorry
but
i
couldnt
finish
it
if
they
changed
the
name
into
something
like
rambo

000
it
would
be
a
big
seller
in
india
poured

with

also
evident
almost
a

is
very
strong

with
the
alcohol
showing
its
massive
presence
strong
alcohol
bite
finish
is
also
very
strong
on
alcohol
not
my
type
of
beer
over
all
i
would
say
it
was
nice
to
try
but
i
will
not
be
getting
another
one
of
these
in
the
future
drinkability
i
would
love
to
say
i
could
drink
more
of
this
as
it
is
very
good
however
at
14
i
should
probably
not
body
is
big
slick
and
almost
syruppy
coats
your
palate
with
each
sip
very
good
and
worthy
of
praise
but
be
careful
one
bottle
is
enough
to
split
3
ways
opinion
this
is
as
similar
to
a
wine
as
a
beer
it
is
very
assertive
and
aggressive
on
the
palate
it
is
a
whole
lot
different
if
you
are
talking
about
traditional
doppelbocks
this
aint
no
celebrator
and
has
very
few
melanoidins
or
other
rich
malt
flavors
its
calling
card
is
as
much
alcohol
produced
esters
as
anything
it
is
a
world
class
beer
and
one
to
be
commended
for
managing
to
get
a
lager
yeast
that
high
in
alcohol
if
nothing
else
i
enjoyed
it
its
unlike
any
other
doppelbock
ive
had
i
was
lost
in
trying
to
discover
more
traditional
malt
flavors
and
i
found
no
hops
at
all
just
the
same
i
believe
this
to
be
a
fine
brew
i
expected
the
alcohol
to
be
un
front
in
your
face
at
15
but
it
wasnt
as
harsh
as
i
expected
i
really
enjoyed
this
unusual
beer
i
will
definitely
drink
more
of
this
i
have
heard
this
beer
being
compared
to
a
dopplebock
but
it
is
much
more
intense
i
have
found
this
brew
to
be
dangerously
easy
to
drink
very
nice
and
of
course
the
drinkability
of
a
14
bomb
that
doesnt
even
hide
the
alcohol
right
certainly
drops
low
on
my
book
as
well
plus
whod
be
up
for
buying
and
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
stock
up
on
aunt
jemina
and
cheap
rum
instead
had
this
on
tap
last
evening
over
at
mahars
from
what
i
w
as
told
it
was
2004
vintage
brew
was
poured
to
a
brown
color
with
a
lot
of
red
like
highlights
brew
had
no
head
what
so
ever
the
aroma
is
more
or
less
of
alcohol
with
dark
fruits
not
a
bad
smelling
brew
the
taste
reminds
me
a
bit
of
cold
medicine
with
its
alcohol
taste
dominating
and
the
fruit
flavors
complementing
it
i
am
not
really
able
to
pick
much
more
up
from
the
taste
as
this
brew
acts
like
syrup
and
really
coats
the
mouth
and
the
above
stated
flavors
seem
to
stay
with
me
even
after
i
have
finished
the
brew
not
a
bad
brew
not
my
favorite
but
would
get
it
again
what
a
fantastic
unique
beer
very
drinkable
for
1
although
it
seems
like
it
should
take
a
good
hour
to
drink
almost
like
a
wine
i
cannot
imagine
drinking
it
as
i
would
a
typical
lager
one
of
these
is
enough
for
a
night
14
abv
drinkability
is
only
average
i
surely
wouldnt
want
another
right
now
and
i
think
my
tongue
has
had
enough
of
this
syrup
to
last
me
quite
a
while
until
i
may
try
it
again
either
way
i
am
glad
to
have
at
least
tried
this
worlds
most
extraordinary
beer
despite
any
disagreements
i
may
have
with
the
statement
on
the
label

caramel

the

the

caramel
flavor
with

this
beer
is
very
sweet
the
high
alcohol
is
not
at
all
hidden
the
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
little
carbonation
definitely
a
slow
sipper
i
know
lots
of
people
love
it
raisins
but
its
lost
the
richness
of
the
dark
malts
and
the
alcohol
comes
through
too
easily
otherwise
its
fairly
similar
in
appearance
well
i
have

of

5pretty
much
average
across
the
board
for
me
very
sugary
tasting
which
is
to
be
expected
it
says
dopplebock
for
the
description
on
this
website
but
it
says
malt
liquor
probably
some
importing
exporting
type
law
that
makes
them
state
malt
liquor
this
is
the
finest
malt
liquor
ive
ever
had
though
as
it
is
complex
and
syrupy
to
the
point
of
you
can
actually
see
the
beer
cling
a
bit
to
the
glass
super
strong
alcohol
taste
and
aroma
there
is
a
candy
corn
background
and
the
alcohol
is
snappy
and
needed
with
such
a
thick
brew
without
a
doubt
a
nightcapper
this
is
a
beer
to
have
right
before
bed
not
necessarily
because
of
the
alcohol
content
but
because
it
would

overall
i
was
expecting
something
a

better
from
this
beer
perhaps
if
this
had
more
than
2
years

it
would
be
better
but
for
me
this
just
isnt
working
while
not
terrible
its
just
not

the

the

is
very
eisbocklike
and
is
of

smells
are
of
a
dark

mix
with
a
moderate

aroma
the
taste
is
rich
and
complex
dark

tastes
are
allover
here
and
range
from

an
alcohol
taste
is
noted
and
contributes
to
complexity
drinkability
is
hampered
by
the
14

and
overall
richness
of
samichlaus
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
tastes
more
like
an
eisbock
than
a
dopple
and
has
an
insane
amount
of
malt
flavor
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
one

will
i
have
another

no
will
i
have

drinkability
this
beer
is
closer
to
scotchs

rather
than
other
beers
it
was
good
to
review
it
but
i
wont
drink
it
on
a
regular
basis
i
will
rather
drink
a
beer
more
usual

the
standards

overall
had
a
bottle
at

a

beer

considereing
the
high

there
was
much
more

couldve
done

half

really
creeps
up
on
you
and
reminds
you
that
beer
deserves
your
respect
it
is
a
slow
sipper
if
you
take
it
too

it
becomes

a

a
beer
of

a

of
a

from
what
i
can
tell
there
is
no
stronger
doppelbock
on
earth
though
there
are
a
couple
others
that
come
in
at

well
this
beer
was
somewhat

bangs
right

is

by

almost
a

taste
with
a

not
sure
what
all
the
hype
is
surrounding
this
one
though
perhaps
this
was
a
standard
bearer
of
big
beers
before
the
extreme
movement
took
off
in
the
u
s
this
doppelbock
poured
a
clear
orangeamber
color
with
tan
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
lightly
sweet
with
a
complex
malty
aroma
and
a
hint
of
banana
alcohol
was
also
evident
in
the
aroma
the
taste
was
very
rich
and
malty
with
the
flavor
of
alcohol
and
fusel
alcohols
noticeable
overall
the
flavor
was
complex
the
mouthfeel
was
warming
and
smooth
with
mediumfull
body
and
low
carbonation
the
sweet
maltiness
lingered
on
the
palate
pleasantly
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
and
was
quite
drinkable
for
its
strength
drinkability
this
as
a
very
nice
warming
beer
for
the
winter
but
its
not
what
i
would
expect
from
a
doppelbock
it
is
a
wonderful
bier
that
has
done
very
well
with
age
there
is
no
one
flavor
that
overpowers
any
other
flavors
it
just
adds

drinkabilitynotes
absolutely
excellent
a
superb
apertif
or
after
dinner
drink
do
not
miss
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
spectacular
beer
ive
had
quite
a
few
big
beers
and
im
reluctant
to
admit
i
had
a
hard
time
getting
a
grip
on
samichlaus
it
will
take
repeated
samplings
on
a
regular
basis
but
thats
a
sacrifice
im
willing
to
make
not
a
huge
fan
it
was
too
much
of
mostly
everything
i
could
see
that
this
might
benefit
from
aging
so
perhaps
i
will
do
an
experiement
this
is
a
hefty
beer
it
warms
you
up
like
liquor
must
be
drank
slowly
to
be
appreciated
has
a
great
taste
a
creamy
mouthfeel
to
it
highly
recommended
hurlimann
made
this
brew
in
250
ml
bottles
and
i
can
really
see
why
taste
is
great
and
powerful
a
very
very
good
brew
to
just
sit
and
sip
at
for
an
hour
or
so
i
have
some
2002
bottles
left

store
and
some
from

bring

it

you
right

it
just
didnt
do
anything

said
this
was
the
sweetest
beer
hed
ever
tasted
for
me
with
a
small
head
of
bubbles
that
disappear

the

a

is

for

the

sweetness
it
would
be
hard
to
put
down
more
than
2
or
3
of
these
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
a
very
complex
beer
that
should
not
be
overlooked
i
may
try
to
age
a
few
and
see
where
they
go

particularly
with
chocolates
if
youre
into
extremely
smooth
dopplebocks
with
a
nice
toffee
taste
then
this
will
be
your
thing
not
much
to
this
beer
flavor
was
good
but
i
thought
there
was
something
missing
drank
it
from
the
bottle
and
it
just
seemed
a
little
flat
would
try
it
again
maybe
draft
in
a
glass
would
improve
the
feel
and
taste
overall
i
like
this
take
its
different
than
i
think
some
classic
german
styles
in
the
same
vein
but
i
like
it
for
that
quality
particularly
one
of
my
favorites
this
was
a
decent
beer
amazing
and
different
throughout
drinking
transparent
amber
in
color
very
little
head
retention
sweet
malty
aroma
as
expected
even
sweeter
taste
just
enough
of
something
else
probably
hops
to
keep
it
balanced
finishes
with
a
slight
alcohol
warmth
overall
not
bad
but
some
people
might
turned
off
because
of
how
sweet
it
is
id
recommend
to
have
one
in
order
to
compare
to
others
but
one
could
live
without
it
carmel
sweetness
but
there
is
something
about
this
beer
that
i
really
dont
like
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
overall
a
great
dopplebock
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
and
lasting
head
but
otherwise
a
great
representative
of
the
style
o
a
decent
enough
drink
but
not
a
style
im
partial
to
with
but
a
few
frames
of
reference
including
the
ayinger
celebrator
which
i
really
liked
id
say
this
is
a
passing
take
on
the
style
but
nothing
outstanding
and
as
a
standalone
product
decent
but
not
to
my
tastes
overall
a
very
clean
doppelbock
with
excellent
attenuation
which
makes
for
a
very
nice
drinking
experience
in
my
opinion
it
doesnt
stack
up
to
its
worldclass
german
counterparts
andechs
and
ayinger
but
it
offers
a
pleasant
diversion
here
in
michigan
well
done
bells
pretty
smooth
and
not
over
heavy
for
an
8
abv
would
recommend
it
o
im
a
fan
of
doppelbocks
and
this
is
a
good
one
this
is
a
great
full
bodied
delicious
winter
warmer
kind
of
beer
now
i
have
to
go
find
a
six
pack
overall
strong
and
rich
and
smooth
and
drinkable
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
large
tulip
a
beautiful
clear
deep
mohagany
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
of
dates
caramel
brown
sugar
all
malt
no
discernable
hop
presence
taste
follows
the
nose
with
malty
sweetness
and
dried
fruit
dried
plums
caramel
raisins
a
little
bit
of
bread
mouthfeel
is
nice
a
little
thin
low
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
example
of
doppelbock
well
done
maybe
i
have
had
this
one
too
long
although
i
hear
you
can
put
some
age
on
it
i
will
be
short
with
this
review
it
was
poured
out
halfway
through
drinking
so
that
i
could
get
to
something
else
i
found
it
to
cloying
it
was
not
balanced
enough
to
make
it
an
enjoyable
experience
i
may
try
another
in
a
different
setting
but
i
believe
that
it
was
too
malty
and
sweet
for
my
taste
pours
a
murky
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
dark
fruit
toffee
leather
tobacco
soy
sauce
and
slight
cardboard
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
dark
fruit
leather
tobacco
soy
sauce
and
slight
cardboard
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
earth
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
interesting
leather
fruit
and
tobacco
characteristics
all
around
o
while
this
beer
is
sweet
it
is
not
cloying
and
it
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
it
is
a
definite
slow
sipper
overall
very
good
brew
overall
certainly
something
i
could
drink
again
overall
a
classic
american
take
on
the
doppelbock
style
fresh
tasting
and
quite
good
to
toast
over
good
food
and
good
friends
a
deep
tawny
color
this
dopplebock
dark
but
relatively
clear
the
smell
is
all
malt
rich
and
with
depth
there
is
some
distant
dark
fruit
as
well
the
taste
is
malty
and
a
little
roasted
quality
some
bitterness
and
very
full
in
body
the
beer
is
flavorful
and
very
enjoyable
its
a
solid
dopplebock
overall
i
am
a
fan
of
the
style
and
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
i
think
it
hits
a
lot
of
the
benchmarks
but
does
not
hit
them
very
hard
this
is
my
first
encounter
with
a
dopplebock
so
its
a
little
hard
to
judge
this
without
a
point
of
reference
may
return
to
review
again
at
a
later
date
this
lager
pours
a
brown
hazelnut
color
with
very
little
head
or
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
malty
and
warming
with
notes
of
dried
fruit
and
a
little
toasted
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
and
close
to
full
bodied
the
flavor
is
rich
and
deep
lots
of
malt
almost
a
fruitcake
like
quality
and
a
nice
warming
alcohol
bite
this
is
a
nice
beer
especially
on
a
cold
day
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
the
style
to
get
a
better
idea
of
what
they
should
be
like
this
ones
pretty
good
but
could
be
beefed
up
a
little
bit
seems
like
somewhere
in
between
a
bock
and
a
dopplebock
overall
really
a
well
done
dopplebock
imho
just
delicious
a
very
nice
balance
of
flavors
all
complimentary
while
this
is
definitely
a
sweeter
beer
the
boldness
of
the
dark
fruits
roasted
malts
grassy
hops
and
light
minerals
and
even
the
faint
alcohol
heat
all
balance
out
the
sweetness
perfectly
i
dont
consider
this
overly
sweet
or
syrupy
in
the
least
glad
i
got
a
case
of
this
will
definitely
pick
up
another
case
next
spring
highly
recommend
j
overall
drinkability
dangerously
drinkable
i
really
wish
i
had
seen
a
six
pack
of
this
in
the
store
and
picked
one
up
rather
than
the
single
i
spied
rich
and
full
of
flavor
went
well
with
a
meal
pasta
and
chicken
with
a
cream
sauce
and
i
would
not
mind
having
it
all
by
itself
will
definitely
have
to
revisit
this
one
next
time
im
at
the
store
for
more
beer
o
sharp
and
prickly
with
great
dark
fruit
and
earthy
flavors
playing
off
each
other
this
serves
up
a
tad
rough
and
lacks
lush
refinement
o
a
nice
tradition
version
of
the
style
from
an
american
brewery
who
prides
itself
on
creating
true
to
style
beers
i
havent
had
too
many
american
doppelbocks
but
ive
had
quite
a
few
of
the
german
ones
available
here
and
ive
had
troegenator
which
is
one
of
americas
other
highly
rated
doppelbocks
and
id
say
id
give
the
slight
edge
to
troegenator
none
the
less
a
great
beer
i
will
have
to
try
this
again
and
review
this
well
review
overall
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
better
american
doppbocks
out
there
that
being
said
there
is
something
about
the
richness
of
the
german
ones
that
keeps
me
going
to
them
poured
a
clear
deep
brown
with
a
thinner
ecru
head
the
head
has
minimal
retention
but
what
does
last
leaves
a
little
lacing
there
is
a
nice
sweeter
malty
aroma
and
the
taste
follows
along
there
is
also
a
light
earthy
hops
in
the
background
within
the
flavor
a
little
reminder
of
dark
fruit
it
has
a
nice
silky
unctuous
feeling
and
is
a
b
doppelboch
o
another
solid
offering
from
bells
doppelbock
fans
will
enjoy
this
one
consecrator
is
an
aboveaverage
doppelbock
recommended
poured
a
dark
brownish
copper
with
less
than
a
half
finger
of
head
that
dissipated
rapidly
the
nose
was
bready
the
malt
profile
is
solid
but
this
offering
suffers
from
a
problem
that
i
think
is
pronounced
in
the
style
the
cidery
alcohol
taste
is
quite
intrusive
upon
the
overall
flavor
profile
the
body
is
hearty
and
the
finish
is
nicely
dry
overall
good
beer
in
my
opinion
this
beer
defintely
doesnt
drink
like
an
8abv
very
smooth
very
crisp
and
refreshing
try
one
larry
if
you
read
this
my
review
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
that
my
wifes
favorite
beer
is
bells
two
hearted
thanks
for
all
you
do
stay
two
hearted
your
autograph
to
my
wife
o
solid
brew
from
bells
drinks
really
easy
and
is
nice
on
the
palate
definitely
worth
a
drink
this
beer
needs
to
become
more
popular
well
done
bells
on
a
difficult
style
that
doesnt
seem
to
jump
the
atlantic
very
gracefully
this
beer
is
best
about
20
minutes
before
its
allowed
to
warm
all
the
way
to
room
temperature
if
that
makes
sense
o
tasty
enough
but
i
fear
this
particular
bottle
did
not
age
well
the
vinegar
aroma
hangs
on
as
does
some
similar
flavor
as
long
as
i
dont
inhale
its
at
least
drinkable
but
if
i
do
inhale
i
have
to
put
it
down
and
cough
o
overall
a
nice
malty
depth
very
good
flavor
definite
try
per
style
overall
a
great
beer
im
dont
normally
seek
out
german
styles
but
this
is
one
to
behold
overall
not
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
for
still
a
decent
brew
but
lacking
in
the
mouthfeel
and
a
little
too
earthy
for
me
12
ounce
bottle
into
tulip
glass
bottled
on
1222013
pours
slightly
cloudy
reddish
copper
color
with
a
2
finger
fairly
dense
khaki
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
small
cap
that
lingers
slight
foamy
lacing
clings
on
the
glass
with
some
moderate
streaming
carbonation
aromas
of
big
caramel
brown
sugar
pear
apple
raisin
toast
brown
bread
floral
toffee
and
yeast
earthiness
very
nice
aromas
with
good
balance
and
complexity
of
malt
and
yeast
ester
notes
with
good
strength
taste
of
caramel
toast
molasses
raisin

nuttiness
and
yeast
earthiness
lingering
notes
of

light
pepper
and
yeast
earthiness
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
very
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
malt
flavors
with
moderate
fruity
esters
with
good
robustness
and
zero
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
fairly
creamy
and
slick
mouthfeel
that
is
good
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
light
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
doppelbock
style
all
around
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
malt
flavors
with
moderate
fruitiness
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
a
very
enjoyable
offering
a
fairly
decent
doppelbock
but
nothing
to
scream
and
shout
about
omaybe
because
it
wasnt
fresh
that
hurt
it
but
an
8
doppelbock
should
hold
up
for
a
few
months
just
a
miss
by
bells
o
a
solid
doppelbock
nothing
more
a
fine
example
of
the
style
but
not
one
to
seek
out
o
pretty
good
doppelbock
there
are
better
ones
out
there
definitely
a
malt
forward
beer
with
enough
character
to
keep
things
from
being
too
cloying
but
lacks
the
complexity
of
more
traditional
doppelbock
melanoidin
profiles
o
a
well
done
doppelbock
overall
what
we
liked
best
about
this
beer
was
the
nicely
inclusive
aroma
and
its
ease
of
drinkability
from
the
first
look
at
this
beer
things
seems
a
bit
light
the
coloring
sits
lightly
but
never
offensively
so
the
aroma
and
the
taste
too
are
on
the
simplistic
side
and
are
definitely
out
of
balance
while
each
gives
big
sweetness
through
the
caramels
esters
and
cloying
fruity
sugars
the
roast
never
quite
comes
up
to
meet
or
even
it
out
while
this
is
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
we
usually
look
for
something
that
shows
more
depth
and
roast
to
the
malts
and
more
darkness
throughout
a
very
average
stuff
from
a
good
brewery
this
beer
is
pretty
solid
i
was
worried
at
first
because
the
appearance
and
nose
werent
what
i
was
expecting
but
the
flavor
is
everything
i
want
from
a
doppelbock
it
has
a
deep
flavor
its
easy
to
drink
but
the
alcohol
is
present
enough
to
warm
you
up
on
a
chilly
early
spring
day
well
done
and
worth
a
try
very
nice
and
easily
drinkable
doppelbock
it
started
off
just
okay
but
i
really
enjoyed
the
latter
half
of
the
glass
quite
more
than
the
first
half
maybe
the
warmth
helped
it
to
open
up
a
bit
thats
usually
how
it
goes
yeah
i
havent
had
an
insane
amount
of
doppelbocks
to
compare
to
but
this
one
was
pretty
damn
good
as
good
as
celebrator
probably
not
but
a
great
take
on
the
style
nonetheless
i
love
a
doppelbock
but
find
this
slightly
weak
in
taste
despite
the
obvious
bulk
of
malt
used
to
achieve
8
percent
abv
no
alcohol
feel
but
easy
and
smooth
this
is
good
just
not
great
overall
nice
enough
doppel
nothing
outstanding
overall
this
beer
is
very
good
solid
doppelbock
clean
flavors
not
too
sweet
maybe
more
helles
bock
than
doppelbock
but
the
lighter
doppelbocks
are
a
good
balance
to
the
heavier
ones
o
with
no
shortage
of
malts
available
the
lack
of
a
nose
in
this
beer
disappoints
its
a
straightahead
doppelbock
thats
enjoyable
to
drink
but
doesnt
offer
anything
to
separate
it
from
the
pack
malt
profile
could
be
mistaken
for
a
scotch
ale
which
is
fine
by
me
this
would
be
a
great
candidate
to
barrelage
and
add
those
characteristics
to
give
it
more
complexity
allinall
this
beer
is
one
that
id
order
because
i
wanted
to
take
a
break
from
tasting
really
distinctive
brews
and
just
wanted
a
solid
but
unchallenging
maltforward
beer
and
the
menu
lacked
an
exceptional
option
that
couldnt
be
missed
one
thing
to
note
priced
in
the
highteens
for
a
sixpack
there
are
much
better
options
in
this
style
for
the
same
amount
of
money
bottling
date
12313
had
this
at
the
tavern
on
liberty
in
pa
consecrator
is
a
beautiful
auburn
color
with
a
very
healthy
1
5
head
quite
fizzy
carbonation
going
on
here
the
aroma
is
very
powdery
and
candylike
lots
of
fruit
esters
coming
up
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
apricot
plum
purple
grapes
and
raisins
the
taste
is
smooth
and
bready
coating
the
mouth
fairly
well
and
despite
the
8
abv
its
not
too
boozy
overall
this
is
just
like
the
best
german
doppelbocks
i
had
tasted
the
times
i
spent
visiting
there
i
cant
believe
how
smooth
this
is
another
stellar
brew
from
bells
overall
i
havent
had
this
in
nearly
seven
years
i
thought
it
was
a
likable
aboveaverage
dbock
then
and
now
overall
good
beer
not
great
a
few
steps
away
from
being
great
glad
i
tried
it
and
also
glad
i
didnt
pull
the
trigger
on
a
6pack
like
i
initially
wanted
to
before
i
knew
it
was
17
or
18
bucks
completely
crystal
clear
amber
colored
beautiful
not
much
head
and
lightly
carbonated
smells
bready
malty
and
sweet
taste
is
bready
and
slightly
sweet
some
grape
and
raisiny
flavors
finishes
clean
alcohol
hidden
mouthfeel
is
relatively
light
for
being
somewhat
high
gravity
this
is
expertly
crafted
and
an
american
hallmark
of
the
style
wont
find
many
better
for
this
style
than
this
this
style
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
o
meh
probably
will
pass
on
this
in
the
future
a
solid
beer
from
bells
again
do
yourself
a
favor
and
drink
almost
everything
they
make
and
youll
be
all
set
o
overall
this
wasnt
a
bad
doppelbock
a
few
steps
above
average
o
i
like
it
a
lot
a
first
but
not
so
much
as
it
warmed
i
do
like
doppelbocks
but
some
times
they
get
too
sour
for
me
as
this
did
but
i
would
try
it
again
and
keep
it
colder
o
really
liked
this
beer
and
im
a
big
fan
of
the
doppelbock
style
in
general
so
i
may
be
biased
such
a
great
balance
of
enough
sweetness
to
balance
the
malt
on
this
one
i
couldnt
taste
a
bit
of
the
8
on
this
brew
will
definitely
be
looking
for
and
drinking
this
beer
again
o
this
is
a
must
try
for
doppelbock
fans
and
dark
beer
fans
it
hits
all
the
right
notes
for
a
doppelbock
and
it
hits
them
with
flair
this
is
a
sweeter
malt
focused
beer
and
the
balance
comes
more
from
the
funkiness
of
the
yeast
and
only
somewhat
from
the
hops
the
result
is
a
very
pleasing
brew
for
malt
fans
overall
i
am
not
usually
a
fan
of
the
doppelbock
style
but
i
absolutely
loved
this
creation
by
bells
the
maltiness
leads
to
a
smooth
finish
with
a
slight
hint
of
the
alcohol
content
but
is
not
at
all
overpowering
if
you
are
a
fan
of
doppelbocks
or
other
malty
beers
this
one
is
a
must
try
not
a
beer
style
i
choose
to
drink
often
but
remember
it
well
from
earlier
times
in
germany
and
think
bells
has
done
a
great
job
o
a
very
drinkable
imperial
dopplebock
that
is
a
bit
sweeter
and
fruitier
than
usual
o
yet
another
solid
beer
from
a
great
brewery
i
had
been
putting
off
trying
this
one
and
finally
did
it
i
was
worth
it
poured
into
a
stella
chalet
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
one
inch
off
white
head
with
minimal
lace
if
any
smell
is
figs
brown
sugar
carmel
apple
and
alcohol
taste
is
all
of
those
very
balanced
with
carmel
apple
being
the
most
dominant
flavor
body
is
thin
to
medium
not
much
carbonation
not
dry
and
pretty
easy
going
down
not
my
favorite
style
but
also
not
anywhere
near
the
best
of
this
style
i
have
had
o
not
my
favorite
from
bells
not
bad
flavors
but
too
sweet
and
the
etoh
is
too
prevalent
for
my
palate
poured
into
a
pint
glass
copperish
color
and
little
head
smells
of
chocholate
but
thats
it
taste
is
exceptional
but
mouthful
dwindles
as
the
beer
dwindles
good
beer
but
not
exactly
what
i
expected
from
this
company
bells
usually
hit
the
spot
but
this
one
is
a
tad
mediocre
o
bar
none
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
from
bells
i
cannot
seem
to
figure
out
why
others
covet
this
brew
but
for
me
i
will
just
avoid
it
from
now
on
bells
did
a
nice
job
with
consecrator
doppelbock
its
not
among
the
worlds
best
doppelbocks
but
its
a
good
effort
itd
be
a
notch
better
with
a
little
less
of
an
alcohol
flavor
and
a
stronger
nose
still
very
good
nonetheless
easy
recommendation
on

madison
im
downgrading
my
original
score
4
5
from
three
years
ago
how
i
used
to
love
this
stuff
it
hasnt
changed
i
have
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
a
doppelbock
everything
you
would
expect
from
the
style
one
of
the
better
american
versions
o
a
good
malty
offering
not
as
rich
and
heavy
as
most
other
dopplebocks
ive
tried
pretty
drinkable
and
enjoyable
o
its
bells
need
i
say
more
this
is
a
rich
intense
caramel
amber
hue
with
foam
that
quickly
dissipates
it
has
a
rich
malty
caramel
aroma
notice
the
trend
here
thats
mellow
and
sweet
and
a
mellow
sweet
caramel
malt
flavor
third
times
the
charm
with
a
warming
alcohol
finish
doppledeliciousness
this
beer
really
didnt
bring
a
lot
to
the
table
other
than
a
sour
lingering
alcohol
taste
even
as
the
beer
warmed
no
real
flavors
came
through
great
to
look
at
but
not
to
drink
overall
enjoyable
this
is
my
first
dopplebock
so
im
not
sure
what
to
compare
it
to
being
a
fan
of
bells
id
wanted
to
try
it
for
a
while
it
drinks
smooth
and
pleasant
with
many
flavors
id
expect
out
of
a
quad
but
with
a
lighter
feel
im
glad
to
have
it
will
revisit
every
month
or
two
to
see
how
it
ages
im
not
sure
if
i
will
search
this
beer
out
necessarily
but
i
would
like
to
try
some
others
of
this
style
to
see
what
some
others
taste
like
comparatively
its
a
satisfying
and
interesting
drink
that
ill
gladly
buy
a
6
pack
of
next
time
i
see
it
maybe
the
feel
could
be
beefed
up
and
the
aromatics
of
the
nose
could
be
stronger
but
there
is
little
that
could
be
done
to
make
this
doppelbock
taste
more
amazing
pours
a
very
light
brown
bordering
on
amber
a
gentle
pour
brings
little
to
no
head
to
speak
of
and
what
there
is
dissipates
quickly
clear
no
haze
smells
malty
of
molassas
and
licorice
with
a
touch
of
hops
to
counter
mouthfeel
is
light
and
delicate
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
goes
down
extremely
smooth
sweet
up
front
with
a
tinge
of
alcohol
fairly
complex
follow
up
with
notes
molassas
and
honey
tastes
like
a
dopplebock
should
in
short
has
zero
bitterness
in
the
finish
in
fact
a
sweetness
lingers
on
the
tongue
making
you
want
more
overall
this
beer
lacks
the
complexity
of
the
topshelf
dopplebocks
but
it
is
a
nice
entry
from
an
outstanding
brewer
everything
about
it
says
traditional
right
down
to
the
blankor
name
that
dopplebocks
typically
have
m
mediumtothick
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
slightly
sticky
in
the
finish
but
not
syrupy
a
major
hint
of
toffee
and
caramel
add
to
the
pleasant
finish
creating
what
is
overall
a
commendable
choice
especially
if
youre
big
into
bocks
o
a
nice
beer
but
i
wouldnt
consider
this
one
of
bells
keystone
beers
overall
it
is
full
pack
of
malt
a
little
more
of
a
bite
than
i
was
expecting
still
smooth
at
its
core
but
theres
an
earthy
bitterness
that
keeps
the
sweet
in
check
corn
syrup
i
was
expecting
more
caramel
and
toffee
but
it
was
glaringly
absent
i
know
theye
were
going
for
german
feeling
and
they
hit
it
dead
on
its
not
a
world
class
beer
but
its
still
good
mouthfeel
is
incredible
and
perfect
goes
down
well
at
a
cold
temperature
but
froths
up
perfectly
in
the
leave
sticks
well
the
beer
is
as
flavorful
once
its
down
as
in
the
midst
of
a
sip
d
i
would
session
this
one
nice
doppelbock
from
bells
recommended
this
is
a
tale
of
two
beers
for
me
the
smell
is
underwhelming
and
sets
up
low
expectations
for
the
taste
but
those
are
quickly
broken
the
finish
is
simply
the
best
part
with
an
amazing
sweet
yet
light
floral
lingering
presence
this
actually
makes
it
a
nice
sipper
this
was
quite
the
treat
but
easily
snuck
up
on
me
it
drinks
like
8
but
it
was
so
delicious
that
i
had
to
have
more
o
sweet
and
good
for
a
cold
night
o
a
typical
example
of
this
style
by
no
means
defines
it
at
14
99
a
6
pack
with
5
more
yet
to
consume
this
has
got
to
be
the
shittiest
value
in
my
5
months
of
trying
real
beer
didnt
really
piss
me
off
till
i
looked
at
my
receipt
just
now
and
saw
what
i
paid
for
this
crap
overall
a
clean
and
drinkable
doppelbock
not
quite
as
impressively
malty
as
some
examples
but
solid
in
its
own
right
the
beer
is
dark
orange
hinting
on
chestnut
brown
with
a
half
inch
of
light
tan
head
that
leaves
sparse
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
of
malt
alcohol
light
spice
toffee
caramel
malt
comprise
the
flavor
the
flavor
offers
more
depth
and
complexity
than
was
indicated
in
the
aroma
slightly
sweet
a
malt
forward
beer
as
is
expected
in
a
dopplebock
alcohol
presence
is
there
but
unobtrusive
medium
to
light
in
body
with
moderately
low
carbonation
overall
a
solid
american
version
of
a
doppelbock
overall
nice
great
malt
and
sweetening
agent
flavors
i
e
molasses
toffee
etc
great
fruits
and
complex
flavors
hint
of
warming
booze
well
balanced
and
drinkable
i
would
def
have
this
again
overall
not
good
and
nearing
bad
i
finished
it
but
mostly
so
i
could
accumulate
adjectives
for
this
review
probably
the
worst
beer
from
bells
ive
had
an
odd
doppelbock
but
it
has
a
nice
smell
and
tastes
okay
fuller
medium
body
higher
carbonation
sticky
and
prickly
on
the
tongue
a
decent
doppelbock
i
enjoyed
the
fruit
tones
and
the
alcohol
was
under
control
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
while
it
might
not
be
in
the
very
top
tier
for
the
style
i
found
it
adhered
to
it
very
well
big
sweet
boozy
tasty
overall
my
first
doppelboch
so
its
new
to
me
i
like
this
one
unique
and
easier
to
drink
than
i
expected
a
little
cloying
but
great
for
the
style
overall
pretty
good
beer
overall
not
the
strongest
offering
by
bells
by
any
stretch
but
its
worth
giving
a
shot
sorry
bells
but
you
let
me
down
on
this
one
this
is
my
first
doppelbock
and
i
think
i
just
dont
like
this
style
of
beer
i
was
never
a
fan
of
lagers
especially
higher
alcohol
lagers
so
take
my
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
tastes
a
bit
like
baltika
9
cut
with
steel
reserve
bleh
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
its
a
deep
red
thats
a
touch
cloudy
and
a
wimpy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
striking
with
an
abundant
amount
of
plumb
and
some
toffee
the
taste
is
subdued
but
only
slightly
with
a
bit
more
of
the
malt
coming
out
to
make
it
more
balanced
its
smoothness
is
almost
at
the
top
of
the
scale
but
it
does
have
a
mild
dryness
i
dont
see
much
in
this
style
overall
a
great
beer
id
have
again
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
doppelbock
by
any
means
isnt
even
worthy
of
drinking
the
bathwater
of
great
examples
of
this
style
from
salvator
weihenstephaner
and
especially
ayinger
also
falls
way
way
short
of
the
best
american
example
from
thomas
hooker
this
is
a
pass
for
me
as
far
as
a
recommendation
goes
im
unsure
whether
or
not
this
is
really
spot
on
for
style
but
per
my
personal
enjoyment
it
was
not
satisfactory
i
am
not
a
doppelbock
connoisseur
so
i
will
rate
as
close
to
style
as
i
know
this
doppelbock
was
on
tap
at
the
tap
table
one
night
when
i
stopped
in
i
had
always
wanted
to
try
this
beer
from
bells
but
hadnt
seen
it
around
i
ordered
a
glass
and
as
it
was
brought
to
me
i
couldnt
help
but
notices
its
really
nice
looking
brown
color
the
head
was
nice
and
left
a
pretty
good
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
of
malts
were
on
the
nose
along
with
some
sweet
aromas
too
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
kind
of
like
caramel
or
brown
sugar
mixed
with
a
roasted
bitterness
and
some
dark
fruits
also
the
mouthfeel
had
a
decent
thickness
to
it
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
good
and
would
drink
it
again
one
day
a
wonderful
surprise
after
being
disappointed
in
batch
10000
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
one
and
i
came
away
happily
and
pleasantly
surprised
a
sweet
yet
complex
and
certainly
delicious
doppelbock
would
love
to
try
this
one
again
i
utilized
a
slow
gentle
pour
so
as
not
to
disturb
any
lees
that
may
be
lying
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
as
a
result
i
only
got
some
wisps
in
terms
of
head
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
with
ruby
highlights
and
nequality
clarity
nose
was
rich
with
a
caramel
malt
sweetness
wow
this
might
end
up
being
breakfast
and
lunch
today
followed
by
a
nap
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
but
the
flavor
was
rich
caramel
on
the
tongue
man
this
could
be
a
dessert
beer
easily
finish
was
rockabyebaby
smooth
lulling
me
that
much
closer
to
a
nap
it
was
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
so
and
the
alcohol
was
not
in
evidence
proceed
cautiously
overall
does
a
fairly
nice
job
hiding
the
alcohol
i
enjoyed
the
fact
that
it
wasnt
too
sweet
but
i
didnt
find
this
beer
particularly
interesting
overall
this
is
well
done
and
im
excited
that
i
finally
tried
a
bells
beer
now
about
that
hopslam
o
a
fairly
good
doppelbock
i
wish
the
nose
and
flavor
profile
were
more
prominent
overall
a
nice
strong
lager
has
malty
character
in
spades
and
is
big
without
being
overpowering
would
make
for
a
nice
beer
in
winter
to
sip
while
sitting
by
the
fire
overall
not
my
favorite
style
stout
kind
of
guy
but
this
one
is
pretty
sound
and
flies
right
next
to
german
counterparts
could
use
a
bit
more
coffee
or
chocolate
to
really
bring
out
the
most
of
the
style
but
better
than
average
o
great
beer
i
love
dopplebocks
and
this
one
delivers
the
goodness
without
missing
a
beat
o
i
have
not
has
too
many
doppelbocks
but
i
did
enjoy
this
one
it
does
not
drink
like
a
beer
that
is
8
overall
extremely
good
for
the
style
rich
malt
flavors
but
not
overpowering
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
i
love
the
smoothness
this
is
a
fairly
expensive
beer
but
id
highly
recommend
trying
it
at
least
once
if
your
a
fan
of
sweeter
more
malty
beers
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
weissevase
glass
the
beer
pours
a
deep
vibrant
rubyauburn
coloring
with
a
healthy
thick
lightly
foamy
offwhite
almost
cream
colored
head
aromas
are
sugary
sweet
malt
light
toffee
citrus
and
a
bready
quality
very
interesting
and
very
dense
aromas
also
some
darker
fruits
that
sneak
into
the
smells
like
some
fig
and
date
the
beer
is
tangy
sweet
but
light
on
the
initial
taste
there
are
citrus
flavors
that
ride
the
undercurrent
of
the
beer
that
help
to
keep
it
light
there
are
tangy
caramel
flavors
with
the
slightest
lean
into
sour
that
hit
the
middle
of
the
tongue
and
the
end
flavors
are
a
little
spiced
and
slightly
boozey
the
body
is
surprisingly
crisp
despite
the
roundness
of
the
flavors
the
beer
has
an
aftertaste
that
is
dark
fruit
sweetness
very
rich
but
still
light
crisp
and
light
finish
with
a
slight
drying
effect
at
the
end
very
strong
production
and
a
very
tasty
well
balanced
brew
dark
amberdark
brown
body
with
a
thin
creamy
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
throughout
smells
of
caramel
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
and
a
slightly
fruity
sweetness
all
malty
sweetness
and
not
much
for
hops
the
taste
follows
and
adds
a
bit
of
earthy
hops
but
well
balanced
and
not
overly
sweet
full
body
medium
carbonation
and
a
smooth
finish
overall
this
was
a
great
dopple
easy
drinking
and
alcohol
is
well
hidden
could
use
more
carbonation
to
bring
out
some
of
the
nuances
not
a
bad
not
a
great
beer
malty
goodness
without
being
an
indiscriminate
maltabv
bomb
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
enough
its
got
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
and
is
fairly
thick
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
the
abv
overall
this
is
an
alright
beer
not
the
best
ive
had
but
surely
servicable
especially
for
an
easy
drinking
high
abv
kick
not
up
to
the
level
i
expect
from
bells
though
it
pains
me
to
say
this
was
not
at
all
enjoyable
even
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
america
can
sometimes
miss
badly
as
bells
has
with
their
doppelbock
hopefully
next
years
batch
will
be
better
o
a
decent
drinkable
beer
nothing
special
but
still
enjoyable
i
will
buy
this
again
but
of
the
two
doppelbocks
that
i
have
had
im
not
sure
if
i
prefer
this
over
the
troegs
one
very
solid
doppelbock
really
enjoyed
the
breadiness
o
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
with
a
nice
flavor
profile
drinks
lighter
than
the
8
consecrator
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
the
foam
fades
fairly
quickly
but
leaves
some
thin
lace
clear
light
doppelbock
the
aroma
is
very
malty
a
very
nice
flavor
profile
toffee
or
caramel
some
brown
sugar
flavor
has
some
raisin
or
other
fruit
and
all
the
same
tastes
as
smells
toffee
and
brown
sugar
or
molasses
just
bitter
enough
to
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
nicely
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
moving
towards
full
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
i
was
really
happy
to
get
to
try
this
one
a
lot
like
a
brown
but
pushed
a
bit
no
compaints
but
there
are
better
doppelbocks
out
there
the
aroma
is
some
bready
and
spiced
malts
and
creamy
caramel
which
follows
into
the
flavors
with
a
roasty
toffee
and
a
handfull
of
fig
and
date
like
fruit
flavors
i
expected
more
punch
from
this
one
but
everything
is
really
creamy
and
light
overall
could
use
some
more
viscosity
and
spices
to
hit
the
mark
closer
but
is
a
decent
dopplebock
i
wish
they
would
just
eis
this
thing
overall
subtle
and
elegant
doppelbock
very
nice
flavor
profile
even
though
it
is
fairly
mild
relative
lack
of
aroma
is
the
biggest
detriment
overall
i
was
really
impressed
with
bells
version
of
this
style
that
is
not
my
favorite
it
seemed
a
bit
more
tame
than
a
lot
of
other
bocks
and
had
a
lot
of
brown
ale
like
characteristics
but
turned
up
a
bit
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
american
take
on
the
style
o
i
like
the
beer
alright
but
it
isnt
the
best
representation
of
the
style
or
the
best
representation
of
bells
brewery
i
recommend
trying
this
beer
at
least
once
its
a
winner
if
it
was
11
for
a
6
pack
instead
of
17
id
probably
keep
this
in
my
fridge
a
lot
hint
hint
bells
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
doppelbock
everything
was
balanced
pretty
well
and
spot
on
for
the
style
my
only
critique
is
that
it
came
off
a
little
thin
for
its
style
and
could
have
been
a
little
thicker
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
went
down
smooth
and
did
a
fairly
good
job
at
downplaying
its
8
i
have
been
trying
some
different
doppelbocks
lately
and
so
far
this
one
has
been
my
favorite
i
thought
this
beer
was
better
then
maximator
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
to
keep
around
for
a
while
if
you
like
doppelbocks
you
have
to
try
this
one
it
gives
some
german
ones
a
run
for
their
money
its
nice
to
see
another
quality
brew
from
bells
and
one
that
can
hold
its
own
against
its
traditional
german
counterparts
pours
a
deep
mahogany
brown
with
very
fleeting
wispy
head
lights
scents
of
sweet
bready
malts
and
hints
of
red
fruit
simple
pleasing
tastes
of
deep
caramel
malts
with
slightly
sour
cheers
and
a
pleasant
mild
bitter
bite
refreshing
and
very
sessionable
at
the
abv
a
nice
simple
to
drink
beer
o
overall
a
solid
doppelbock
and
one
that
i
would
reach
for
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
the
style
oits
sweet
and
malty
with
some
spice
taste
like
a
mild
dubbel
to
me
it
ok
but
will
not
buy
this
one
again
o
not
a
bad
beer
good
example
of
the
style
d
overall
not
too
bad
not
my
favorite
bells
beer
but
one
that
i
would
definitely
consider
again
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
malty
brew
worth
a
shot
this
is
a
smooth
drinking
doppelbock
i
would
put
it
between
great
lakes
and
sam
adams
in
my
preferences
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
nice
mahoganyburgundy
color
a
slight
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
smell
is
slightly
sweet
malty
with
a
hint
of
fruit
first
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
some
caramel
some
dried
fruits
and
molasses
that
finishes
with
a
little
alcohol
warmth
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
expected
but
very
nice
easy
to
drink
overall
a
very
good
beer
overall
im
not
normally
a
fan
of
doppelbocks
but
this
is
not
bad
at
all
it
reminds
me
a
little
of
goose
islands
pere
jacques
but
toned
down
in
the
sweetness
department
and
in
the
carbonation
department
a
plus
for
the
former
a
minus
for
the
latter
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
the
sweetness
may
little
the
number
that
you
have
o
overall
loved
it
different
than
i
expected
but
being
fairly
new
to
dopplebacks
didnt
have
a
lot
to
go
on
had
a
hoppy
contender
prior
and
this
was
a
sweet
release
overall
id
say
its
just
a
hair
too
sweet
to
be
perfect
but
was
extremely
enjoyable
and
think
that
it
would
be
foolish
not
to
try
again
especially
if
the
brew
date
is
more
recent
d
a
pretty
good
beer
although
expensive
at
8glass
where
i
was
that
kept
me
from
having
more
this
is
a
solid
doppelbock
though
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
id
happily
drink
more
of
it
if
there
werent
a
few
widely
available
ones
that
are
markedly
better
o
easy
drinking
good
tasting
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
this
is
no
celebrator
as
that
is
my
benchmark
for
this
style
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
closer
nonetheless
certainly
not
a
beer
i
would
refuse
or
not
enjoy
notes
good
but
not
great
doppelbock
plenty
of
raisin
etc
dark
fruit
i
could
work
through
a
six
pack
over
a
couple
of
weeks
but
nothing
i
would
actively
seek
out
a
six
pack
a
year
would
suffice
t
brown
sugar
caramel
and
some
freshly
baked
bread
the
balance
in
this
beer
is
pretty
good
and
its
sweet
without
being
overly
so
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
the
style
dwow
so
drinkable
solid
brew
d
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
in
this
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
a
good
not
great
doppelbock
aftertaste
is
mostly
malty
grape
cloying
with
a
heavy
coating
especially
on
the
palate
light
effervescence
medium
body
decent
but
not
great
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
roasted
caramel
malt
flavor
hints
of
chocolate
hazelnut
and
a
prominent
spice
presence
lots
of
pepper
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
as
well
as
some
subtle
clove
flavor
dry
finish
this
ties
directly
into
the
taste
though
i
get
an
interesting
grape
juice
taste
that
cheapens
the
overall
complexity
of
the
flavor
definitely
malty
and
with
all
of
the
fruity
and
sugar
from
the
nose
medium
body
and
overall
a
quite
drinkable
brew
that
can
be
well
paired
with
a
good
meal
this
was
very
good
the
taste
almost
made
me
think
that
the
beer
could
be
aged
for
a
few
months
but
i
enjoyed
it
nevertheless
i
would
drink
it
again
if
i
didnt
have
to
trade
to
get
it
this
was
a
very
nice
dopplebock
one
that
was
very
easy
to
drink
would
definitely
drink
again
drinkability
almost
perfect
in
my
book
great
beer
for
the

warm
summer
pours
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
dimpled
mug
a
burnt
caramel
color
with
a
pretty
creamy
head
and
nice
staying
power
big
caramel
nose
with
a
little
bit
of
apple
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
rich
caramel
with
just
a
slight
hint
of
the
apple
and
warming
alcohol
a
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
dry
finish
nice
and
creamy
mouthfeel
but
could
be
more
this
elixer
goes
down
very
well
my
hat
is
off
to
you
bells
mdthis
is
a
thick
and
rich
beer
like
most
doppelbocks
imo
but
not
overbearing
really
drinkable
this
is
a
tough
style
for
me
since
im
not
a
huge
fan
but
this
beer
really
made
an
impression
once
again
bells
impresses
me
this
was
nice
but
not
one
of
bells
standouts
in
my
opinion
quite
drinkable
but
lacks
uniqueness
second
doppelbock
in
my
wurzburger
chalice
tonite
this
one
being
way
different
from
the
first
dark
horse
coffee
dopplebock
this
brew
screams
toffee
and
grape
on
the
nose
its
very
potent
at
first
but
i
grow
to
love
it
more
an
more
each
time
i
bring
it
to
my
lips
this
challice
really
does
dopplebocks
justice
they
just
look
appealing
the
head
isnt
much
and
clears
out
fairly
quickly
but
a
nice
swirl
brings
it
back
a
bit
and
it
tastes
nice
as
it
infuses
the
toffee
flavors
into
each
sip
the
carbonation
is
sharp
and
welcome
as
i
feel
it
helps
the
flavors
of
toffee
grape
and
rasins
set
themselves
on
your
tongue
im
thoroughly
enjoying
this
beer
and
just
wish
i
had
more
its
a
great
representation
of
the
style
pours
dark
amber
with
a
light
fluffy
offwhite
creme
head
first
taste
is
of
bready
sweetness
the
sweetness
hangs
around
all
the
way
through
the
tasting
chewy
mouthfeel
i
felt
that
this
was
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
not
overly
memorable
in
the
taste
im
getting
raisin
sweetness
and
cherry
pretty
full
in
body
and
oily
slick
no
alcohol
burn
in
the
end
perhaps
just
a
faint
warmth
leaves
the
palate
a
bit
dry
this
actually
reminds
me
of
some
oktoberfests
ive
had
because
of
the
toasted
quality
to
it
and
that
the
heaviness
of
the
malts
is
toned
down
a
bit
compared
to
other
doppelbocks
tastes
very
german
for
this
reason
very
tasty
though
easy
to
put
back
consecrator
pours
a
rusty
brown
color
with
spots
of
ruby
shining
through
upon
the
beer
being
backlit
a
2
53
finger
khaki
colored
head
rises
up
in
my
glass
but
retention
is
just
average
and
there
is
zero
lacing
to
speak
of
the
nose
is
surprisingly
fruity
theres
a
hint
of
caramel
and
roasted
nuttiness
for
sure
but
fruits
are
the
dominant
influence
those
same
comments
apply
to
the
flavor
as
well
caramel
and
roasted
nuts
show
up
but
fruits
steal
the
show
some
of
the
same
fruits
as
i
might
find
in
a
dubbel
or
belgian
strong
dark
ale
come
to
mind
plums
raisins
etc
but
theyre
a
little
bit
less
dark
and
rich
and
a
bit
more
sweet
and
mild
the
carbonation
is
well
done
it
does
its
job
wthout
getting
in
the
way
of
all
the
malty
flavors
i
found
the
body
to
be
just
a
hair
on
the
thin
side
though
especially
for
a
beer
style
that
was
known
as
a
meal
in
a
glass
consecrator
is
a
solid
offering
from
bells
but
nothing
outstanding
served
from
tap
into
a
shaker
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
to
tan
head
there
was
no
lacing
evident
througout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
yeasty
malt
dark
chocolate
and
slight
cream
the
flavor
was
of
bread
sweet
malt
grapes
and
a
hint
of
raisin
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
honestly
reminded
me
of
malty
grape
juice
with
that
said
i
dont
really
know
how
i
feel
about
this
one
at
all
i
think
that
if
it
would
have
been
toned
back
on
the
grape
a
little
bit
this
could
have
been
a
good
brew
this
would
allow
more
of
the
flavors
to
come
forward
rather
than
taking
a
backseat
to
the
grape
d
easy
drinking
but
doppelbock
is
such
an
enjoyable
style
so
that
is
no
surprise
well
made
beer
that
when
i
shared
with
a
fellow
beer
lover
he
remarked
this
could
be
german
a
chill
hazed
medium
brown
colored
beer
without
much
head
formation
what
there
is
of
it
is
tan
the
smell
is
sweet
and
nutty
with
a
big
roasted
grain
aroma
there
is
a
slight
soy
sauce
aroma
and
a
grain
husk
and
yeast
scent
the
flavor
begins
sweet
and
fairly
grassy
and
grainy
with
a
figs
and
oak
after
taste
fairly
thick
there
is
a
quite
strong
grain
hull
flavor
here
and
it
is
quite
astringent
in
the
mouth
fairly
nutty
in
taste
this
tastes
the
most
like
pecans
the
bitterness
is
present
and
fairly
laid
back
for
a
bock
beer
this
is
very
much
a
malty
beer
and
not
a
hoppy
one
soy
sauce
scent
doesnt
make
it
in
to
the
taste
thank
god
at
8
abv
i
thought
it
might
be
kind
of
boozy
it
isnt
i
picked
up
a
six
pack
so
i
could
hit
a
want
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
not
knowing
what
to
expect
of
the
beer
i
split
a
bottle
with
an
old
friend
over
cigars
other
beers
i
was
surprised
at
how
tasty
it
was
how
well
it
held
up
to
the
cigar
now
that
ive
had
a
bottle
on
a
fresh
palate
im
all
the
more
impressed
flavorful
up
front
clean
in
the
end
and
extremely
drinkable
yep
this
brew
tastes
german
in
comparison
to
many
of
the
sweet
alcoholic
malt
bombs
that
americans
interpret
the
style
to
be
horns
up
to
bells
for
keepin
it
real
d
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
pours
a
clear
bright
amber
color
with
a
quickly
fading
almost
nonexistent
whitish
head
aroma
is
carmel
malt
bready
and
biscuity
as
expected
for
the
style
but
lacking
any
depth
taste
is
exceptionally
sweet
with
dark
malts
and
fruits
dominating
and
a
light
nutty
and
toasty
finish
average
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
this
wasnt
bad
i
just
expect
more
from
bells
and
this
was
a
fairly
pedestrian
beginners
doppelbock
rich
creamy
honeybuttered
brown
bread
on
the
flavor
full
bodied
and
sweet
with
a
dusting
of
toast
and
hops
on
the
finish
i
could
see
this
one
becoming
cloying
but
right
now
it
is
tasting
pretty
good
abv
is
well
hidden
behind
the
chewy
malt
texture
i
must
say
i
am
surprised
at
the
relatively
low
score
this
one
gets
i
think
it
is
a
pretty
satisfying
maltysweet
doppelbock
i
would
buy
this
again
no
problem
another
plus
for
bells
brewery
who
in
my
opinion
is
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
us
cheers
cheers
d
actually
finding
this
to
be
a
quite
enjoyable
dopplebock
full
of
flavor
but
the
aroma
and
body
lacks
substance
solid
beer
nonetheless
drinkability
not
too
many
noticeable
turnoffs
to
make
it
hard
to
have
again
a
very
basic
but
exceptional
according
to
style
beer
from
bells
d
a
sort
of
uninteresting
beer
to
be
honest
which
is
not
something
i
usually
say
about
a
bells
beer
very
sweet
as
well
too
much
so
for
me
drinkabilitythe
fact
that
this
is
not
overly
sweet
really
makes
this
beer
quite
drinkable
abv
is
well
hidden
for
8
good
stuff
nice
malt
flavor
and
enjoyable
noticeable
hops
another
great
offering
from
bells
a
dark
brassy
copper
color
with
a
decent
oatmeal
colored
head
and
fair
lacing
the
aroma
brings
a
mash
malt
and
seaweed
rhubarb
thats
tangy
and
interesting
the
flavor
bangs
out
intense
almost
saltwater
malt
with
an
herbal
hop
and
rye
hint
theres
a
mellow
licorice
sweetness
and
raisin
idea
add
some
bright
citrus
notes
for
good
measure
theres
just
a
little
alcohol
notable
but
the
flavor
dominates
and
is
quite
pleasing
its
solidly
midbodied
with
spritely
but
modest
carbonation
that
is
fairly
drinkable
considering
the
intensity
here
but
you
wouldnt
want
to
pound
these
theres
too
much
complexity
to
enjoy
the
feel
is
tangy
but
smooth
slightly
resinous
but
not
very
thick
just
right
for
enjoying
and
drinking
this
is
surprisingly
tasty
and
drinkable
another
example
of
why
the
bells
toll
for
you
drinkability
is
alright
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
and
there
isnt
much
going
on
a
little
bit
one
dimensional
with
all
of
the
other
great
beers
bells
produces
i
would
probably
just
skip
over
this
one
sweet
smooth
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
a
nice
beer
which
is
a
little
sweeter
than
i
would
like
but
still
good
drinkability
nice
smooth
and
drinkable
but
i
like
my
higher
abv
beers
to
have
some
bite
not
bad
but
it
could
use
some
work
to
really
get
me
into
it
d
the
alcohol
never
seems
to
creep
up
even
as
it
warms
a
bit
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
however
this
is
a
fairly
good
brew
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
flavours
are
right
but
just
lacks
a
bit
of
intensity
however
this
is
a
solid
doppelbock
pours
a
darkish
reddy
brown
with
a
quick
dying
tan
head
large
sweet
caramel
malt
along
with
hints
of
bread
chocolate
and
roasted
and
a
minor
bit
of
hops
and
fruit
a
little
husky
and
dry
chewey
has
a
good
sweet
malt
base
and
is
a
little
biscuity
as
well
tealike
fruit
hops
like
grape
on
backend
for
a
dry
finish
slightly
offbalance
but
still
an
enjoyable
beer
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
dopplebocks
that
i
have
tried
s
the
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
with
some
bready
malt
ans
caramel
and
a
faint
touch
of
hops
not
out
of
this
world
but
pretty
solid
so
far
d
overall
not
too
shabby
not
my
favorite
bells
beer
but
one
that
i
would
definitely
consider
again
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
malty
brew
worth
a
shot

enjoying

d
the

one
id
gladly
drink
again
d
actually
finding
this
to
be
a
quite
enjoyable
dopplebock
full
of
flavor
but
the
aroma
and
body
lacks
substance
solid
beer
nonetheless
excellent
reminiscent
of
dogfish
head
raison
d
etre
on
tap
d
above
average
drinkability
i
really
enjoy
malty
beers
especially
doppelbocks
this
was
a
very
nice
take
on
the
style
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
that
i
havent
seen
replicated
very
much
nice
work
on
this
bells
i
got
this
in
a
trade
with
fear025
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
glass
into
my
sa
perfect
pint
glass
it
pours
a
deep
orange
with
ruby
highlights
very
thin
head
no
lace
the
aroma
is
fruity
malty
and
sweet
on
first
sip
the
beer
is
full
of
dark
fruit
and
a
bit
boozey
it
is
on
the
sweeter
side
but
not
overly
so
the
beer
is
full
bodied
and
moderately
carbonated
imo
a
solid
doppelbock
drinkability
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
if
it
were
more
readily
available
to
me
in
nyc
i
recommend
this
to
those
seeking
a
solid
doppelbock
that
is
full
of
malt
and
dark
fruit
but
light
in
body
drinkability
its
not
bad
the
high
alcohol
content
knocks
it
down
slightly
for
me
but
its
pretty
good
if
you
go
in
thinking
octoberfest
its
a
pretty
darn
good
interpretation
similar
to
a
paulaner
ofest
for
instance
slightly
sweeter
with
a
discernible
alcohol
kick
in
the
finish
yeah
i
wasnt
really
feeling
the
doppelbock
here
but
still
enjoyable
notes
medium
mouthfeel
k
just
kidding
but
really
this
beer
is
just
not
very
interesting
too
me
i
prefer
butthead
doppelbock
from
tommyknockers
the
most
pleasant
surprise
of
this
month
for
me
d
a
very
nice
brew
although
its
a
little
sweeter
than
what
i
usually
drink
this
might
make
it
difficult
to
drink
several
of
md
full
body
but
not
sticky
alcohol
is
slightly
warming
but
otherwise
very
well
hidden
drinkability
is
high
for
the
style
though
my
comparisons
are
few
i
expect
some
may
be
hot
overall
good
beer
at
8
though
watch
out
drinkability
pretty
good
a
bit
too
sweet
in
an
odd
way
i
enjoy
sweeter
dopplebocks
but
something
about
this
came
across
as
too
sweetrich
glad
to
try
it
but
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
pours
a
rubyish
amber
color
with
some
light
fluffy
tan
head
as
well
as
some
light
lacing
lots
and
lots
of
carbonation
with
a
very
souribitter
taste
hints
of
something
not
sure
what
that
give
it
a
bit
of
a
fruity
taste
and
smell
feels
almost
like
a
soda
but
not
in
a
bad
way
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
how
different
in
a
good
way
that
it
was
nice
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
tons
of
heavy
bready
malts
belgian
like
yeastbottle
says
lager
yeast
abv
isnt
even
detectable
at
8
picking
up
some
caramel
notes
but
flavor
overall
is
a
little
light
for
a
doppelbock
its
good
not
great
medium
body
but
not
complex
a
solid
good
beer
like
most
beers
from
bells
overall
this
is
a
nice
take
on
the
style
but
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
by
bells
very
high
standards
its
not
quite
as
complex
or
as
powerful
as
a
doppelbock
has
the
potential
to
be
but
its
an
interesting
and
nicedrinking
beer
all
the
same
nice
doppleboack
and
maybe
the
best
i
have
had
since
celebrator
not
as
good
but
i
liked
it
it
was
a
dark
brown
with
charred
malts
flavor
some
sweet
molasses
tatse
nice
beer
this
is
one
delicious
beer
the
sweetness
gets
to
be
too
much
after
about
two
of
these
though
pours
a
pretty
transparent
mahogany
with
a
decent
light
yellowishbeige
head
aroma
is
malty
and
strongly
spicy
mainly
of
cloves
and
cinnamon
pleasantly
spicy
flavor
is
mainly
of
cloves
and
malt
with
a
hint
of
caramel
texture
is
very
smooth
a
bit
thick
edgy
and
rather
fizzy
d
not
impressed
a
lot
of
people
talk
bells
up
but
i
cannot
think
of
a
single
beer
of
theirs
that
i
love
i
have
to
put
them
at
the
top
of
my
list
of
most
overrated
craft
breweries
a
very
pleasant
malt
bomb
plenty
of
dark
fruit
alcohol
and
molasses
flavor
overall
this
is
a
nice
doppelbock
its
a
little
sweeter
than
what
i
prefer
but
not
bad
with
an
8
abv
i
dont
know
that
i
would
want
to
drink
too
many
of
them
but
it
is
a
good
one
to
sit
back
on
a
hot
summer
night
and
enjoy
one
with
some
friends
d
easy
to
drink
the
lingering
sweetness
does
take
a
bit
away
from
drinkability
reviewed
from
my
notes
based
on
a
bottle
provided
by
sigma23
and
also
split
with
deltatauhobbit
this
bottle
is
at
least
a
year
old
perhaps
two
the
beer
is
dark
amber
with
some
light
brown
aspects
as
well
the
tan
head
was
a
few
centimeters
thick
but
disappeared
quickly
it
has
a
great
toasted
malt
aroma
there
is
some
brown
sugar
in
there
as
well
its
all
very
robust
i
can
taste
some
sweet
malt
some
brown
sugar
and
a
bit
of
the
alcohol
there
may
be
some
plum
in
there
as
well
its
a
very
tasty
combination
it
has
a
heavy
body
and
low
levels
of
carbonation
theres
plenty
of
mouth
coating
with
some
alcohol
vapors
present
i
find
it
to
be
pretty
drinkable
on
a
per
glass
basis
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
too
many
of
these
in
an
evening
but
this
single
pour
is
very
enjoyable
pours
a
murky
muddy
coppery
brown
color
with
no
head
lacing
or
retention
smell
is
of
sweet
carmel
malts
roasted
nuts
brown
sugar
and
hints
of
plum
taste
is
carmely
sweet
at
first
sip
mellowing
out
to
nutty
pruney
rasiny
and
slight
brown
sugary
and
biscutiy
profile
with
a
decent
amout
of
bittering
hops
on
the
end
medium
to
full
bodied
slick
and
oily
on
the
palate
lacking
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
because
it
manages
to
avoid
being
cloyingly
sweet
but
nothing
too
memorable
compared
to
others
in
the
style
d
easy
although
it
is
kind
of
like
carbonated
sugar
water
in
consistency
good
beer
with
a
lot
going
on
despite
the
high
abv
i
could
easily
put
down
a
few
of
these
toasted
malty
aroma
with
a
hints
or
raisins
and
plums
no
hops
or
dieacetyl
are
evident
medium
sized
dark
tan
head
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
film
glowing
dark
brown
beer
with
ruby
highlights
rich
malty
flavor
is
mildly
sweet
plum
and
dark
sugar
flavors
peak
their
head
in
later
on
a
very
slight
bitterness
cut
the
sweetness
in
the
finish
but
that
bit
of
hops
never
threatens
the
malt
dominance
there
is
a
pleasant
warming
in
my
chest
from
the
alcohol
moderately
carbonated
with
a
fairly
full
body
but
the
sweetness
never
becomes
overbearing
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
was
really
into
doppelbocks
last
year
and
though
the
price
on
this
one
was
up
there
i
figured
id
give
it
a
shot
i
dont
regret
buying
it
but
would
recommend
future
tasters
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
a
single
bottle
as
a
sixpack
isnt
worth
the
price
pours
a
clear
red
color
34
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
yeast
sweet
malt
pale
malt
and
slight
hop
fits
the
style
of
a
doppelbock
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
sweet
malt
pale
malt
slight
hop
and
a
slight
hint
of
citrus
overall
a
good
blend
body
and
aroma
overall
this
decent
but
nothing
special
d
just
what
you
would
expect
from
a
good
dopplebock
rich
malty
this
one
delivers
my
only
complaint
is
how
syrupy
it
feels
34
of
the
way
through
the
bottle
it
tastes
great
but
is
rather
filling
still
a
solid
example
of
the
style
d
solid
dopplebock
overall
though
perhaps
a
tad
too
sweet
overall
with
that
said
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
with
a
round
chewy
mouthfeel
but
i
have
found
the
way
to
drink
it
quickly
i
know
its
expensive
like
a
sipper
but
you
never
had
a
better
tasting
guzzler
and
it
goes
down
extremely
well
what
a
great
aftertaste
indulge
yourself
excuse
me
while
i
chug
a
half
a
glass
of
this
wheres
the
malty
richness
bah
humbug
this
beer
isnt
offensive
but
it
is
pretty
boring
i
was
able
to
drink
this
fairly
quickly
the
alcohol
does
not
come
out
at
all
except
for
a
very
small
hotness
which
is
barely
detectable
i
would
not
mind
going
for
another
bottle
and
soon
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
definitely
an
easy
drinking
doppelbock
its
relatively
light
with
some
good
malt
flavors
making
it
a
pretty
good
drinking
beer
it
tasted
lake
malty
raisins
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
there
again
was
the
cough
medicine
im
not
a
total
snob
so
ill
finish
what
i
bought
but
wont
be
replenishing
or
serving
it
to
guests
md
mouthfeel
is
full
and
rich
no
burn
from
the
alcohol
only
some
flavor
this
is
a
dangerously
smooth
drinking
doppelbock
that
can
certainly
warm
days
in
the
ides
of
march
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
brown
with
nearly
two
fingers
of
foamy
ecru
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
a
surface
murk
and
leaves
webby
halos
of
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
of
raisins
dark
malts
figs
vanilla
almonds
plums
and
even
some
subtle
raspberries
the
taste
leads
with
a
figgy
maltiness
then
pushes
into
a
light
molasses
with
an
alcohol
warmth
and
finishes
with
a
colalike
flavor
the
body
is
lightly
medium
with
nicley
low
carbonation
a
silky
smooth
texture
and
a
crisp
finish
all
told
a
delightfully
tasty
and
drinkable
brew
has
a
medium
body
good
carbonation
and
for
an
8
beer
its
pretty
drinkable
dquite
tasty
with
some
nice
dark
fruits
i
little
boozy
and
warms
slightly
in
the
back
not
quite
a
very
tasty
beer
and
definitely
one
to
be
tried
my
first
words
were
this
seems
like
something
you
could
drink
all
day
im
not
sure
if
my
descriptions
are
doing
justice
to
how
juicy
sweet
enjoyable
and
deeply
complexbut
above
all
extremely
drinkablethis
beer
is
fantastic
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
this
beer
has
weight
but
is
not
too
heavy
it
has
good
carbonation
and
really
goes
down
smooth
pours
a
deep
red
color
quite
lovely
the
taste
is
really
smooth
with
a
noticeable
maltiness
a
sweet
tart
flavor
rounds
out
the
finish
all
in
all
very
drinkable
but
no
bold
flavors
nothing
over
the
top
for
8
abv
this
beer
goes
down
very
easily
notes
very
nice
dopplebock
a
little
bit
more
hopped
than
a
traditional
db
it
seems
but
still
very
malty
and
easy
drinking
good
alcohol
kick
to
boot
this
was
a
let
down
for
me
from
bells
considering
the
price
and
other
available
options
drinkability
is
good
not
the
greatest
doppelbock
out
there
but
a
very
solid
example
drinkability
this
beer
was
hard
to
get
down
a
sipper
that
should
have
been
a
drain
pour
but
16
a
sixer
manned
my
way
through
the
strange
flavors
grow
on
you
as
the
bottle
goes
on
and
it
actually
masks
the
alcohol
fairly
well
this
isnt
terrible
just
a
little
strange
at
times
drinks
get
awesome
texture
to
a
beer
smooth
d
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
could
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
make
no
mistake
this
is
no
aylinger
doppelbock
just
an
ok
beer
better
when
it
warms
up
im
a
fan
of
bells
and
dig
a
lot
of
their
beers
imo
this
beer
is
much
better
than
the
average
rating
if
you
like
dopplebocks
try
it
you
wont
be
dissapointed
if
your
a
stout
fan
i
highly
recommend
their
expedition
stout
which
is
fantastic
drinkability
i
can
see
how
people
might
like
this
but
i
think
its
nothing
special
too
simple
and
boring
if
you
ask
me
taste
is
malt
with
some
hops
in
the
back
ground
the
only
thing
that
keeps
this
from
being
a
pretty
good
beer
is
that
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
i
say
that
even
though
i
find
myself
enjoying
beers
on
the
sweeter
side
this
beer
is
so
sweet
i
find
it
rich
d
pretty
drinkable
a
bit
sweet
so
not
something
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
while
i
like
sweeter
beers
this
kind
of
coats
your
mouth
id
finish
with
this
beer
as
it
could
alter
the
taste
of
other
beers
due
to
its
sweetness
o
overall
im
disappointed
at
bells
ive
come
to
expect
excellent
beers
from
this
brewery
and
for
the
style
this
beer
simply
doesnt
make
the
cut
the
fact
that
i
paid
a
lot
for
it
too
makes
me
mad
as
i
could
of
had
ayinger
celebrator
the
best
for
the
same
price
drinkability
is
ok
but
a
bit
one
sided
and
a
little
too
much
sweetness
there
are
better
doppelbocks
available
but
this
isnt
bad
why
such
a
low
avg
score
overall
a
solid
offering
from
bells
im
not
the
hugest
fan
of
this
and
ive
had
many
better
doppelbocks
but
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
overall
a
pretty
solid
doppelbock
a
tad
on
the
sweeter
side
though
perhaps
i
have
been
spoiled
by
other
dopplebocks
most
notably
celebrator
which
i
had
along
side
this
i
would
consider
this
a
few
steps
below
it
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
ruby
hue
when
held
to
light
smallish
bubbly
tan
head
dissipates
quickly
holy
malt
aroma
batman
lots
of
molasses
and
toffee
and
burnt
sugar
raisins
and
some
other
dark
dried
fruits
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
very
little
if
any
hops
present
in
the
aroma
taste
is
more
of
the
molasses
caramel
and
burnt
sugars
you
think
its
going
to
be
sweet
but
theres
just
enough
hops
and
alcohol
in
there
to
pound
that
malt
back
down
finishes
with
a
lingering
pruneraisin
finish
thick
body
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
thats
a
pretty
damn
good
dopplebock
bells
continues
to
impress
me
with
every
beer
i
get
to
try
consecrator
reminds
me
of
germanys
highlyrated
andechser
doppelbock
with
as
much
oomph
and
gooey
sweet
deliciousness
as
that
one
id
call
this
beer
severely
underrated
at
the
mere
bgood
rating
it
currently
has
here
another
fine
fine
beer
from
bells
overall
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
slightly
carbonated
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
also
medium
this
is
another
descent
beer
from
bell
it
has
a
rich
in
depth
flavor
that
is
encompassing
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
drinkability
is
lowered
by
the
sweetness
not
horrible
but
it
gets
almost
a
bit
cloying
mouthfeel
medium
to
thin
bodied
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
clear
dark
amber
with
a
fine
sand
colored
head
dark
fruit
brandy
and
chocolate
make
up
the
mild
nose
on
this
one
sweet
roasty
malt
raisin
pumpernickel
breadiness
and
just
a
touch
of
warming
alcohol
in
the
finish
mildly
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
easy
to
drink
but
tastes
more
like
a
marzenoktoberfest
than
most
great
dopplebocks
ive
had
before
d
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
despite
the
abv
the
lack
of
an
alcohol
taste
allows
this
to
be
more
than
a
sipper
sweet
drinkability
its
a
great
beer
thats
got
a
lot
going
on
i
really
dig
the
sweetness
and
i
especially
like
the
chewy
body
it
goes
great
with
food
and
compliments
the
strong
german
cuisine
that
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
to
eat
with
it
the
abv
is
a
bit
high
but
hey
when
youre
eating
it
with
food
it
sits
a
little
easier
i
think
if
i
was
just
drinking
it
at
the
end
of
the
day
or
at
a
bar
i
would
definitely
have
to
go
easy
and
be
sure
to
drink
some
water
with
it
unless
i
wasnt
driving
then
i
wouldnt
really
care
drinks
pretty
easy
for
the
abv
but
reminds
me
more
of
a
strong
english
ale
or
a
wee
heavy
than
a
bock
not
near
as
good
as
i
hoped
dgood
but
not
the
greatest
dopplebock
its
refreshing
on
one
hand
complex
and
interesting
on
the
other
fuller
hand
d
the
achohol
is
hidden
very
well
wouldnt
have
more
than
2
in
a
row
though
purchased
from
rays
liquor
in
wauwatosa
wi
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
bready
aroma
medium
bodied
with
a
very
sweet
carmel
flavor
cloying
finish
with
some
warm
alcohol
feel
nice
to
try
one
bottle
but
i
dont
need
another
until
next
spring
drinkability
dangerously
drinkable
goes
down
very
easily
yummy
very
drinkable
beer
would
love
to
have
more
this
might
do
well
with
some
age
not
too
long
i
think
d
fruity
and
delicious
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
flavor
is
subtle
and
complex
definitely
a
winner
this
is
a
weird
one
for
me
thanks
to
loki
for
this
in
trade
pours
a
rustic
reddishpinkish
almost
rusty
from
what
little
brown
there
is
quick
swirl
of
carbonation
that
quickly
fades
down
smells
like
caramel
like
a
werthers
almost
weird
a
bit
of
grassiness
and
malt
but
overall
the
smell
is
pretty
subdued
a
boozey
blast
from
the
smell
too
taste
is
very
syrupy
especially
going
down
some
more
caramel
and
some
sweet
toasty
malts
just
a
bit
of
the
hop
kick
but
by
this
point
the
syrupyness
has
reasserted
itself
not
that
big
in
body
thin
for
a
doppelbock
its
definitely
coating
but
in
the
wrong
way
also
tastes
boozey
at
first
but
it
turns
out
to
be
very
drinkable
i
dont
know
what
the
cost
runs
for
this
but
i
suspect
there
are
better
options
out
there
not
my
favorite
doppelbock
but
one
that
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
from
time
to
time
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
dark
golden
brown
color
some
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
with
some
minimal
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
with
lots
of
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
tasty
brew
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
drinakability
very
high
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
very
accessible
for
people
who
like
dopplebocks
or
those
who
are
just
getting
into
them
solid
medium
body
for
mouthfeel
huge
body
for
flavor
im
ready
for
it
to
come
out
next
season
poured
slightly
chilled
into
pils
glass
all
i
had
that
was
clean
a
nice
clear
dark
copper
over
rocky
head
that
lasted
a
short
time
with
some
carmelcolored
lacing
that
faded
quickly
smell
of
malt
sweet
hint
of
grain
but
very
light
taste
was
again
malt
sweetness
good
balance
of
hops
though
no
bitterness
detected
nor
was
there
much
of
an
alcohol
taste
despite
8
abv
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
fairly
drinkable
again
despite
its
8
percent
a
good
beer
beautiful
clear
dark
amber
smallish
head
but
lasting
lace
smells
like
a
maple
syrup
jelly
bean
would
i
kid
you
awesome
tastes
like
one
too
oh
just
kidding
i
guess
it
tastes
exactly
like
it
smells
but
its
hard
to
qualify
that
smell
theres
tiny
carbonation
bite
which
is
fine
and
in
style
theres
a
little
residual
bitterness
also
fine
its
sweet
i
get
brown
sugar
the
nice
organic
kind
not
just
cheap
nobrand
crap
there
is
a
little
musty
malt
to
the
aroma
and
yeah
you
get
malts
in
the
mouth
too
melanoidin
well
that
or
decoction
i
suppose
thats
the
dominant
flavor
a
munichdecoction
thing
very
good
for
the
style
pretty
much
right
on
everywhere
kudos
thanks
for
the
extra
abbddull
d
for
a
dopplebock
i
enjoy
the
sweet
malt
but
i
think
the
sweetness
goes
too
far
on
this
one
its
borderline
too
much
in
the
drinkability
department
not
enough
balance
dark
copper
brown
with
a
nice
head
after
an
aggressive
pour
smell
is
very
sweet
lots
of
honey
brown
sugar
raisins
and
taste
is
of
bread
and
bananas
with
some
yeast
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
the
beer
is
just
too
sweet
it
seems
to
be
big
for
no
real
reason
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
subtle
and
drinkable
beer
for
the
style
pretty
decent
but
there
are
other
better
and
for
me
more
accessible
examples
of
the
style
future
outlook
bocks
like
this
are
interesting
changes
of
pace
for
me
but
certainly
outside
of
my
preferences
hard
for
me
to
knock
any
aspect
too
much
though
nothing
about
it
really
wowed
me
would
be
worth
a
revisit
specifically
as
a
change
of
pace
but
not
something
im
likely
to
seek
out
any
time
soon
too
sweet
for
my
taste
it
kills
the
drinkability
d
has
a
sweet
flavor
that
hides
the
alchohol
which
makes
it
very
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
d
a
good
solid
doppelbock
but
a
far
cry
from
the
best
in
the
style
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
worth
a
try
it
did
well
to
make
me
want
to
look
into
doppelbocks
more
as
a
style
enjoyable
and
complex
didnt
rock
my
world
but
above
average
bells
consecrator
dobbelbock
demonstrates
clearly
what
m
jackson
described
as
a
moreish
beer
it
is
impossible
to
take
a
single
sip
and
not
return
to
the
glass
almost
immediately
as
the
abv
suggests
this
is
not
a
session
beer
but
if
you
need
to
loosen
up
a
bit
or
are
seeking
a
little
comfort
and
warmth
this
is
the
perfect
beer
the
beer
has
a
beautiful
mouthfeel
that
lingers
it
pours
a
dark
dense
brown
with
an
intensely
contrasting
compact
head
while
the
hops
are
restrained
and
the
malt
forward
and
enveloping
it
is
well
balanced
this
dobbelbock
is
a
perfect
meal
replacement
during
lent
it
is
also
a
fine
companion
for
meals
that
we
may
seek
when
weary
and
hungry
this
beer
can
stand
up
to
the
richest
of
dishes
but
is
also
a
fine
beer
when
you
need
to
round
out
your
meal
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
fullmalty
richness
i
would
also
sip
it
as
an
afterdinner
alternative
way
drinkable
for
an
8
beer
and
way
drinkable
for
a
doppelbock
the
light
mouthfeel
and
slight
hop
balance
go
a
long
way
on
this
with
the
mild
flavor
profile
and
a
hidden
abv
this
guy
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
the
last
time
i
had
this
beer
was
just
shy
of
20
years
ago
i
remember
it
being
a
lot
more
bold
back
then
but
maybe
my
expectations
have
evolved
d
great
a
good
beer
to
introduce
someone
into
the
more
complex
world
of
brews
drinkability
a
definite
malt
bomb
the
sweetness
int
he
finish
lingers
long
making
this
an
easy
drinking
yet
flavorful
beer
i
am
a
big
fan
of
many
beers
from
bells
and
this
one
was
new
to
me
when
it
came
i
got
a
distinct
malty
smell
the
color
was
really
deep
and
rich
with
very
little
head
however
i
found
the
flavor
to
not
be
quite
to
my
liking
i
lean
more
toward
a
strong
bitter
hoppy
flavor
this
beer
was
a
little
sweeter
than
i
tend
to
like
and
more
malty
it
was
great
to
sample
but
i
doubt
i
try
this
again
on
the
other
hand
my
wife
loved
it
as
this
is
more
of
her
style
of
beer
overall
not
the
best
doppelbock
out
there
nothing
too
drinkable
something
from
bells
i
wont
be
buying
again
quite
drinkable
for
a
doppelbock
alcohol
is
not
discernable
given
how
tasty
it
is
i
could
easily
enjoy
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
nice
dark
amber
pour
with
thin
head
smells
are
malty
and
sweet
it
has
a
nice
smell
taste
is
heavy
with
malt
and
very
sweet
up
front
the
sweetness
fades
and
you
get
some
alcohol
in
the
back
of
the
throat
not
a
bad
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
i
rather
enjoyed
this
one
nose
is
tough
to
describe
german
malts
with
yeast
which
has
a
bready
paper
twang
to
it
smooths
out
and
gets
creamy
as
it
warms
nice
buttery
mouthfeel
8
percent
is
well
hidden
good
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
bells
brews
d
this
one
didnt
do
it
for
me
the
huge
level
of
carbonation
and
the
rather
bland
flavors
just
didnt
work
for
me
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
even
more
glad
i
didnt
buy
a
sixer
and
just
went
with
the
single
bells
can
do
better
than
this
a
good
beer
to
start
your
journey
in
dopplebocks
overall
this
is
a
great
lighter
doppelbock
from
a
great
brewery
d
very
tasty
a
bit
underrated
id
say
smooth
nicely
complex
and
lighter
than
it
should
be
could
stand
to
be
a
little
darker
and
stickier
in
the
head
and
legs
though
this
might
be
better
on
tap
but
its
just
not
hitting
the
palate
right
for
me
tonight
unusual
for
bells
d
eminently
drinkable
this
is
only
the
second
doppelbock
ive
reviewed
and
enjoyed
them
both
immensely
this
seems
to
be
bit
heavier
in
the
mouth
than
the
ayinger
celebrator
this
is
a
good
one
to
drink
through
the
cold
months
which
given
the
release
date
will
be
quite
a
few
in
chicago
and
transition
to
the
ayinger
as
the
weather
warms
up
overall
its
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
a
very
interesting
beer
an
ok
beer
but
far
below
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
bells
fortunately
i
was
able
to
get
a
fresh
glass
of
two
hearted
afterwards
to
wash
away
the
taste
of
the
consecrator
overall
a
nice
example
of
the
style
smooth
and
drinkable
d
the
alcohol
on
this
beer
is
fairly
well
hidden
and
its
smooth
balanced
sweetness
makes
it
quite
easy
to
indulge
d
easy
and
smooth
for
a
beer
like
this
probably
the
maltforward
character
that
helps
we
had
completely
forgotten
the
8
alcohol
abv
taste
caramel
flavor
from
the
malts
dry
floral
and
herbal
hop
finish
excellent
brew
not
celebrator
but
damn
good
pours
a
clear
warmlooking
ruby
red
with
a
small
tan
head
and
extremely
fine
carbonation
slowly
drifting
up
from
the
bottom
the
nose
is
extremely
faint
but
smells
of
honey
and
flowers
the
flavor
more
than
makes
up
for
the
weak
aromas
this
tastes
of
sweet
but
not
cloying
carmel
with
rich
dark
fruits
and
a
slight
toastiness
that
adds
greatly
to
its
character
very
nice
i
would
recommend
this
beer
without
hesitation
and
would
definitely
buy
it
again
if
only
it
were
a
bit
cheaper
d
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
too
many
in
one
night
due
to
abv
but
definetly
wish
this
was
around
alot
longer
then
it
is
the
drink
is
heavymedium
in
body
with
a
tingle
of
mild
carbonation
the
body
of
the
drink
is
silky
and
firm
with
a
touch
of
lingering
syrup
left
on
the
tongue
good
drinkability
i
remember
being
blown
away
by
this
last
year
as
the
first
doppelbock
i
had
ever
had
in
fact
it
really
changed
my
way
of
thinking
about
lagers
i
didnt
know
they
could
taste
like
this
however
after
trying
many
of
the
best
available
german
import
versions
this
one
seems
rather
pedestrian
still
its
pretty
tasty
just
not
anywhere
near
the
germans
very
nice
and
highly
sessionable
beer
but
keep
an
eye
on
the
abv
pretty
copper
color
pour
with
a
two
finger
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
aroma
is
sweet
malts
toasted
caramel
brown
sugarripe
fruits
and
candy
flavor
is
maltyquite
sweet
some
soft
nutty
flavors
dark
bread
and
hints
of
wood
and
an
odd
but
good
spice
in
the
far
aftertaste
almost
like
saffron
light
alcohol
comes
through
in
spots
as
well
body
is
medium
to

theres
some
lively
carbonation
keeping
things
honest
ends
with
more

sweet
malts
candyspice
yummy
thank
you
bells
md
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
a
bit
of
alcohol
warming
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
from
bells
but
not
bad
tasty
would
get
this
again
2008
bottle
so
about
9
months
on
this
one
orangeamber
pour
a
very
small
amount
of
white
head
sweet
aromas
malt
toffee
and
caramel
it
is
a
pretty
sweet
beer
with
flavors
matching
the
aroma
maybe
slight
raisin
along
with
the
sweets
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
in
this
medium
bodied
brew
there
is
just
enough
hops
to
give
a
slight
kick
at
the
end
to
me
this
makes
it
a
good
version
of
the
style
could
probably
use
just
a
bit
more
hopping
which
is
unusual
to
say
for
a
bells
brew
edit
this
brew
deserves
better
than
a
damn
b
especially
based
solely
on
style
it
is
certainly
better
than
most
stateside
attempts
at
the
style
and
in
my
mind
could
easily
stack
up
to
its
european
brothers
very
nice
and
surprisingly
drinkable
even
though
i
am
just
savoring
every
sip
johngalt1dec

but
its
not
bad
at
all

though
the

falls

little
lame

its

pours
ruby
red
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
dissipates
initially
this
beer
had
a
bit
of
a
medicinal
taste
that
fortunately
faded
as
the
beer
approached
its
proper
temperature
taste
really
doesnt
distinguish
its
self
with
maybe
some
carmel
malt
it
also
has
a
smooth
feel
and
finish
easily
drinkable
not
a
big
double
bock
here
in
paducah
followed
by
an
ethanol
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
great
its
very
smooth
and
even
creamy
at
least
until
the
lingering
alcohol
finale
drinkability
is
just
average
but
is
worth
exploring
on
its
own
merits
and
not
much
carbonation
the
aroma
was
kind
of
sickly
sweet
malt
ill
try
this
again
in
a
year
and
hope
for
improvement
but
for
now
this
beer
is
a
drain
pour
the
worst
dopplebock
ive
tasted
to
date

and
ripe

malt
is
just
this
side
of
cloying
theres
an
interesting
bite
here
not
as
good
as
my
standby
california
doppel
from
sudwerk
this
beer
is
personally
only
drinkable
one
at
a
time
an
average
doppelbock
earthy
odor
with
some
fruity
tones
too
great
taste
fruity
as
the
sweetness
does
take
some
time
to
deal
with
between
sips
definitely
not
a
sessionable
beer
with
light
hints
of
caramel
and
molasses
a
pretty
average
doppelbock
i
was
hoping
for
more
i
thought
the
malt
magician
larry
bell
could
turn
out
a
more
aromatic
but
i
think
that
is
a
good
thing
overall
but
not
to
the
point
where
it
was
comparable
to
a
stout
or
something
of
that
nature

the

are

this
is

attempt
at

i

this

not

i
like
this
beer
a

too
bad
its
so
seasonal
this
pours
a

color
it
smells

the
taste
follows
the

it
is
sweet

malty
with
some
dark

flavors
such
as
plum
and
raisin
it
has
a
good
mouthfeel
with
medium

i
think
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
one
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
bells
i
highly
recommend
trying
it
drinkability
suffers
some
just
bc
of
the
alcohol
presence
this
would
be
great
as
a
night
cap
or
an
apertif
another
solid
offering
from
bells
strongly
recommended
overall
a
pleasing
experience
but
not
exceptional
this
beer
poured
up
a
deep
caramel
color
with
a
nice
foamy
head
that
faded
fast
lots
of
activity
continues
in
the
glass
the
nose
is
very
subtle
but
my
sense
of
smeel
is
not
the
best
it
has
a
nice
fresh
flavor
that
is
slightly
fruity
and
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
i
expected
it
to
be
im
also
getting
a
maple
flavor
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
warms
you
as
drink
it
another
solid
brew
from
kalamazoo
id
reccomend
it
to
the
right
person
i
find
consecrator
very
drinkable
perhaps
even
a
good
session
beer
but
i
dont
think
it
holds
up
well
to
other
dopplebocks
celebrator
immediately
comes
to
mind
for
taste
the
taste
is
very
simple
and
upfront
its
good
just
not
much
too
it
i
always
buy
a
few
6
packs
though
when
it
is
in
season
slàinte
medium
bodied
and
a
little
thin
overall
fairly
smooth
flows
over
the
mouth
nicely
this
was
nice
to
try
but
i
dont
see
myself
coming
back
to
it
all
too
often
thanks
to
my
buddy
kmpitz2
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
on
my
trip
to
ky
this
is
the
first
beer
shared
between
me
and
orbitalr0x
on
his
trip
down
to
visit
the
warm
up
for
the
liberator
this
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
sticks
around
very
well
the
nose
is
really
sweet
with
a
sweet
strawberry
fruityness
interesting
the
flavor
is
a
little
weak
not
as
full
and
robust
as
i
would
exect
its
malty
with
a
somewhat
nutty
character
i
like
it
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
with
a
slight
syrupyness
overall
this
is
a
really
easy
drinking
beer
for
8
smooth
and
very
nice
i
have
never
had
a
bad
beer
from
rogue
stone
or
from
founders
for
that
matter
bells
still
has
issues
with
consistant
brewing
across
the
board
this
beer
is
terrible
and
i
wouldnt
recomend
it
to
anyone
i
poured
the
rest

a

decent
beer
seems
to
be
better
than
last
years
version
which
i
didnt
care
for
at
all
still
not
spectacular
i
expect
better
from
bells
ill
probably
get
this
again
though
its
good
and
all
it
just
doesnt
wow
me
all
that
much
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
doppelbock
would
however
i
buy
again
not
likely
maybe
a
single
once
in
a
while
nevertheless
if
you
like
doppelbocks
this
is
one
to
try
overall
a
fairgood
offering
from
a
legendary
michigan
microbrewery

still

they
use

im
quite
fond
of
is
if
god
had
wanted
us
to
filter
our
beers
he
wouldnt
have
given
us
a
liver
if
you
are
ever
in

michigan
you
need
to
treat
yourself
to

where
bells
beer
is
the

dark
copper

aroma
is
caramel
maltiness
and
fruity
apples
and
berries
some

hops
are
noted
but
hard
to
identify
mouthfeel
is
lacking
for
style
being
light
medium
bodied
at
best
carbonation
is
medium
as
well
taste
is
caramel
with
only
a
hint
of

very
fruity
with
apples
pears
and
raspberries
very
odd
for
a
doppelbock
dark
fruits
and
munich
malts
seem
missing
in
action
light
body
is
good
for
drinkability
i
suppose
but
i
expect
more
character
malt
and
body
in
a
doppelbock
and
this
one
falls
short
not
a
bad
one
but
this
would
be
low
on
my
list
of
preferred
doppels
a
very
cold

blustery

with
a

cloudy

body
and
a
quarter
inch
of
tan
head
some
lacing
takes
place
from
the
residual
but
not
a
lot
this
beers
presence
is
from
its
aroma
and
taste
both
of
which
give
off
strong
hints
of
its
caramel
malt
base
the
feel
is
very
full
and
creamy
particles
float
about
and
let
you
know
this
is
a
beer
with
substance
quite
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
creamy
but
just
a
little
too
syrupy
the
finish
was
long
on
the
tongue
as
caramel
and
malt
seemed
to
last
forever
the
syrupy
quality
knocks
down
the
drinkability
a
notch
caramel
to
red
in
color
with
a
quickly
dissapating
off
white
head
that
didnt
leave
any
lace
the
aroma
starts
off
fruity
almost
cidery
and
then
mellows
to
heavy
yeasty
malt
aroma
as
it
warms
the
flavor
is
malty
but
not
too
sweet
and
then
a
spicey
yeast
finish
it
has
lots
of
body
a
heavy
malt
finish
that
leaves
an
effervescence
it
leaves
me
wanting
more
big
caramel
flavor
a
massively
large
warming
down
the
gullet
with
just
a
touch
of
a
roast
bite
hanging
in
the
edges
mercifully
this
brew
has
a
brown
colored
body
with
a
khaki
foam
head
on
top
there
is
a
smooth
malt
scent
some
alcohol
detectable
the
taste
is
fairly
subdued
malt
some
alcohol
spice
slight
hint
of
hops
full
bodied
brew
not
the
all
time
best
but
a
good
brew
found
this
one
at
the
foodery
in
philly
this
poured
very
murky
an
amberburgundy
color
topped
with
a
thin
off
white
head
this
smells
like
a
liquid
strawberry
twizzler
very
interesting
heavy
sweet
and
fruity
malts
the
taste
is
strong
bold
and
complex
but
no
so
much
as
to
scare
on
away
a
floral
hop
presence
just
manages
to
surface
from
underneath
all
that
complex
maltiness
this
is
quite
drinkable
for
such
a
bold
beer
the
alcohol
is
masked
pretty
well
the
body
of
malt
is
solid
and
the
finish
is
cloyingly
sweet
overall
a
great
beer
overall
i
would
say
this
doppelbock
is
a
good
one
to
introduce
people
to
the
style
because
it
is
more
approachable
than
its
european
counterparts
good
work
bells
this
is
a
brewery
that
deserves
respect
drinkability
not
half
bad
i
happily
sipped
this
and
if
i
had
more
i
might
have
reached
for
another
as
it
warmed
the
tartness
gave
way
to
very
strong
sweet
banana
esters
by
the
time
it
was
done
i
felt
like
i
was
eating
my
moms
banana
bread
that
could
be
good
for
some
but
it
sort
of
turned
me
off
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
have
other
dopplebocks
that
i
like
more
its
worth
a
try
at

to
taste
this
strange
yet
decent
interpretation

possibly
fairly
drinkable
for

just

the
sweet

is
warm
and
closing
in

thick
but
its
not
a
big
flavor
very
smooth
theres
a
slight
graininess
in
the
flavor
the
alcohol
shows

this
beer

a
dark

foam
but
lots
of
carbonation

sip
is
full
of

is

doppelbock
to
finish
too
sweet
an
almost
winelike
character
and
a
similar
body
a
bit
thin
bodied
for
my
tastes
the
smooth
mouthfeel
that
one
expects
from
a
doppelbock
also
is
missing
strong
vanilla
aroma
vanilla
beanlike
flavors
emerge
as
this
beer
warms
up
a
perilously
drinkable
double
bock
as
is
the
case
with
most
bells
beers
the
high
alcohol
content
isnt
that
noticeable
it
doesnt
hit
you
until
your
half
way
through
your
drink
starts
kind
of
weak
but
finishes
with
a
with
a
burst
of
intense
caramelmunich
malt
flavor
coated
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bitter
hops
the
party
is
over
quicky
though
and
the
finish
is
quite
short
thanks
to
chucks
fine

their
breakups

a
bamboozling
thanks
to
bighuge
for
this
kalamazooling
offering
a
nice
dark
redbrown
brew
with
ruby
highlights
a
small
white
head
dies
very
very
quickly
leaving
only
small
bubbles
in
its
wake
the
aromas
are
just
sweet
malty
bready
pretzely
and
sweet
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
bready
pretzely
and
sweet
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
and
the
drinkability
is
good
as
well
good
stuff
if
you
like
a
real
sweet
malty
and
uncomplex
doppel
i
usually
love
most
bells
products
however
i
am
let
down
by
this
one
it
pours
a
brownreddish
color
most
doublebocks
that
ive
had
are
as
dark
as
night
the
head
hangs
out
for
a
while
and
vanishes
the
taste
isnt
quite
right
for
a
double
bock
my
best
guess
would
be
the
yeast
i
suspect
that
they
used
bells
ale
yeast
for
a
lager
as
i
get
a
similar
taste
off
of
the
amber
and
the
oberon
which
are
good
for
that
style
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
grainy
and
i
dont
think
id
want
to
drink
a
ton
of
them
due
to
the
strange
yeast
taste
appearance
chestnut
mahogany
amber
brown
unfiltered
color
to
it
topped
with
a
nice
caramel
tan
head
leaves
evenly
rung
specks
of
lacing
cant
complain
aroma
rich
malty
layers
paired
with
what
the
label
calls
old
world
yeast
aka
ringwood
like
in
nature
yeast
works
its
magic
and
brings
out
a
semispicy
bread
note
unique
doppelbock
that
goes
light
on
the
alcoholic
phenols
and
over
ripened
fruit
approach
also
packs
a
decent
helping
of
hops
here
taste
big
flavor
succulent
like
a
well
prepared
portobello
mushroom
sports
a
tasty
sweet
malt
profile
finishes
bready
with
a
touch
of
plum
and
alcohol
infused
flavor
and
heavily
hoppy
flavors
for
a
dbock
keeping
the
bitterness
reserved
great
exploratory

the

nice

unfiltered

german

lager
nice
beer
for
me
i
enjoyed
drinkability
top
notch
balance
not
overly
sweet
great
mix
of
flavors
man
i
really
like
this
beer
well
not
one
of
the
great
dopplebocks
out
there
but
still
not
bad
if
i
saw
it
around
id
probably
give
it
a
try
on
draft
the
taste
is
most
definitely
thick
thick
malt
rich
and
almostpudding
like
providing
a
nice
backing
there
are
some
raisins
in
there
though
this
disappears
as
the
beer
warms
also
the
alcohol
is
very
strong
and
noticeable
though
theres
a
spicy
refreshing
aftertaste
of
hops
at
the
end
wow
8
abv
isnt
significant
but
for
some
reason
the
alcohol
from
this
beer
snuck
up
on
me
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
with
medium
to
low
carbonation
the
finish
is
somewhat
astringent
and
warming
but
not
harsh
big
full
body
with
a
nice
soft
carbonation
its
good
drinking
but
i
couldnt
drink
much
more
than
one
of
these
since
it
packs
quite
a
punch
and
im
not
even
talking
about
the
alcohol
strong
brew
all
around
this
is
one
tasty
beer
finishes
very
quickly
and
alcohol
taste
becomes
more
apparent
as
i
keep
drinking
it
quality
beer
try
this
again
this
one
pours
an
amberbrown
color
with
a
decent
head
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
caramelly
and
sort
of
reminds
me
of
cough
syrup
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
the
same
caramel
feel
that
the
aroma
had
pretty
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
beer
poured
a
murky
prunejuice
brownishblack
only
in
a
doppelbock
would
this
be
good
aroma
hinted
at
caramel
flavor
profile
was
wellmoderated
a
bit
of
caramel
but
not
an
overwhelming
influence
a
touch
of
dried
dark
fruit
prune
in
particular
pleasantly
sweet
but
not
cloying
not
as
much
depth
of
flavor
as
in
some
others
of
the
style
but
in
terms
of
drinkability
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
as
this
beer
was
pleasant
but
not
overly
challenging
i
was
surprised
to
learn
the
abv
is
8
as
the
alcohol
level
was
not
at
all
evident
in
the
flavor
deceptive
sweetness
with
a
nice
rich
mouthfeelsome
alcohol
here
too
the
aftertaste
is
subtle
and
a
little
quicker
than
i
would
like
not
quite
as
deep
or
complex
as
some
beer
of
this
stylebut
still
pretty
good
the
bells
brews
are
all
prety
solid
and
this
is
no
exception
thanks
to
super
trader
crjmellor
for
the
bottles
consecrator
isnt
your
typical
doppelbock
to
be
sure
i
could
probably
only
drink
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
because
of
the
flavor
but
thats
ok
try
one
and
see
for
yourself
drinkability
is
good
but
bottle
version
so
far
pals
in
comparison
to
draught
version
but
still
pretty
darn
good
drinkyumable
ng
on
a
side
note
for
being
a
heavy
hitter
this
stuff
is
remarkably
cheap
the
current
going
price
in
michigan
is
9
for
a
six
pack
which
is
remarkable
for
beer
of
this
quality
i
might
also
note
that
ive
seen
it
around
at
strange
times
of
the
year
which
either
means
bells
is
making
it
more
often
or
has
saved
some
back
and
is
occasionally
letting
it
go
to
distributors
i
hope
they
eventually
make
this
another
regular
seasonal
brew
because
i
think
its
one
of
their
better
small
batch
beers
this
dopplebock
is
redish
brown
with
a
huge
tan
head
malt
is
evident
in
the
smell
and
taste
it
is
lightly
hopped
just
enough
to
tame
the
malty
sweetness
there
is
lots
of
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
great
this
beer
is
so
easy
to
drink
i
found
myself
taking
big
gulps
2002
vintage
on
tap
at
bw3s
downtown
indy
was
only
suppose
to
be
a
16oz
pour
but
the
bartender
already
had
it
in
a
20oz
glass
poured
a
cloudy
reddish
brown
with
no
head
to
speak
of
no
sign
of
any
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
sweet
with
fruit
and
caramel
hints
the
taste
was
more
of
the
same
sweetness
perhaps
overly
so
with
some
hint
of
the
alcohol
thrown
in
there
there
was
very
little
carbonation
evident
however
it
was
still
smooth
and
tastey
alcohol
is
hidden
nicely
in
this
one
at
least
until
i
finished
the
appearance
is
a
caramel
brown
with
a
tan
foamy
head
not
a
lot
of
smell
i
guess
i
would
describe
the
smell
as
earthy
the
taste
is
excellent
it
feels
like
it
belongs
in
my
mouth
its
sweet
and
smooth
and
has
a
slightly
chocolately
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
i
have
to
stop
myself
from
chugging
it
down
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
right
now
chocolate
brown
with
a
medium
tan
head
aroma
is
malty
of
course
somewhat
bold
smokey
with
notes
of
cigar
and
tobacco
the
taste
seemed
a
tad
too
bold
for
me
not
really
clean
too
packed
with
an
earthy
sweet
character
i
didnt
quite
enjoy
especially
in
the
aftertaste
palate
is
flawless
though
oatmeal
stout
round
and
smooth
drinkability
rather
drinkable
but
i
can
get
celebrator
so
why
bother
thanks
to
feloniousmonk
for
this
one
nice
head
at
first
gone
in
a
flash
no
lacing
but
the
beer
is
an
enticing
clear
red
color
smells
slightly
sweet
the
taste
is
mediocre
again
pretty
sweet
and
not
very
complex
tingy
on
the
tongue
the
high
alcohol
content
isnt
too
obvious
but
a
12
oz
bottle
is
still
just
a
little
too
much
i
think
this
is
a
worthy
offering
in
the
doppelbock
field
pours
a
lovely
reddish
amber
color
with
a
medium
almost
butterscotchcolored
but
mostly
beige
head
thin
and
slow
lacing
mediumbodied
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
caramel
and
malt
flavor
up
front
there
are
also
flavors
of
raisins
alcohol
and
sweet
fruit
in
there
the
finish
is
mostly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
a
hops
and
alcohol
spike
i
liked
this
a
lot
it
has
a
thick
tongue
feel
and
a
bit
of
maltiness
the
flavor
is
ok
but
not
an
overly
impressive
doppelbock
this
may
be
only
the
second
time
ive
been
disappointed
with
a
bells
beer
consecrator
pours
a
reddish
copper
color
with
an
extremely
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
to
nothing
after
a
few
moments
smell
is
relatively
subdued
with
minor
notes
of
malty
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
incredibly
sweet
almost
too
sweet
for
the
style
with
a
sugary
sensation
that
i
did
not
care
for
big
time
caramel
malt
is
all
i
could
really
pick
up
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
for
the
style
and
due
to
the
overdone
carbonation
its
hard
to
detect
that
great
fullbodied
bready
mouthfeel
that
most
dopplebocks
possess
drinkability
is
average
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
hard
to
detect
on
the
way
down
due
to
the
sweetness
but
its
noticeable
after
drinking
the
beer
not
a
terrible
effort
but
probably
one
of
bells
weakest
far
from
bells
best
effort
light
in
color
more
tarnished
copperpenny
than
deep
and
rich
malt
to
the
nose
with
a
slight
wet
grass
sensation
not
terribly
inspiring
but
not
awful
flavor
has
some
alcohol
sugar
and
husky
malts
almost
watery
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
its
a
pretty
poor
doppelbock
very
different
from
the
usual
doppelbock
also
tastes
very
onedimensionalmaltiness
with
caramel
and
molasses
this
taste
never
leaves
it
also
has
a
strong
alcoholic
taste
like
most
doppelbocks
but
this
time
the
bells
yeast
and
its
sourness
is
not
near
as
enjoyable
the
balance
and
complexity
are
not
there
but
this
beer
is
still
decent
enough
to
get
again
this
brew
has
a
very
nice
malty
aroma
it
poured
a
nice
light
head
that
quickly
disappeared
it
has
a
very
nice
dark
brown
color
but
its
initial
taste
was
different
from
other
doppelbocks
i
have
tasted
it
was
full
of
a
variety
of
tastes
with
cinnamon
and
caramel
flavors
there
was
a
hint
of
carbonation
rising
off
my
tongue
as
i
drank
it
not
as
smooth
as
the
german
doppelbocks
which
i
prefer
over
this
one
certainly
an
odd
duck
but
nothing
screamed
bad
bottle
to
me
i
just
think
its
not
a
very
good
beer
thanks
to
mjr
for
the
experience
he
had
the
decency
to
warn
me
drinkability
its
not
looking
too
good
this
is
certainly
the
strangest
doppelbock
ive
encountered
it
starts
well
enough
then
completely
takes
a
turn
for
the
worse
ill
stick
with
bells
ales
a
fine
doppelbock
sweet
but
fresh
sweet
if
that
makes
sense
caramelbrown
sugarmolasses
silky
smooth
on
the
tounge
not
overbrearingly
sweet
deeper
in
some
hints
of
alcohol
hit
the
nose
and
the
palate
good
carbonation
a
very
impressive
doppel
that
is
sweet
but
not
overly
thick
definitely
a
beer
to
savor
this
particular
dopplebock
poured
a
medium
head
there
was
no
lacing
on
the
side
of
my
mug
when
i
poured
this
into
my
mug
it
poured
as
a
dark
amber
color
not
much
carbonation
with
this
dopplebock
it
had
a
smooth
taste
to
it
this
was
a
thinner
dopplebock
than
i
have
experienced
with
other
dopplebocks
it
had
a
sweet
aroma
the
taste
was
syrupy
this
was
not
a
good
interpretation
of
a
dopplebock
in
my
opinion
ruddy
chestnut
hue
and
brilliantly
clear
when
decanted
prodigious
stiff
persistent
taupe
head
leaves
jagged
dense
lace
honeyish
sweetness
and
toasted
malt
hit
the
nose
at
first
then
are
contrasted
by
a
tartness
akin
to
unripe
plum
richness
in
aroma
is
provided
by
a
lightly
buttery
toffeish
melanoidin
dark
caramel
malt
combination
caramelized
fruit
sweetness
hits
and
coats
the
palate
initially
then
is
bathed
by
a
detracting
sourness
reminescent
of
sour
sop
sourness
tapers
slightly
allowing
sweetness
to
reemerge
in
a
toasty
bready
fashion
only
to
be
offset
by
light
yet
mildly
astringent
hop
bitterness
becomes
thin
oddly
vinous
and
sherrylike
late
over
attenuated
but
passably
smooth
finishes
with
diminished
lactic
tartness
fading
quickly
and
token
residual
sweetness
fleeting
hmm
a
beer
that
had
potential
but
is
perhaps
a
victim
of
a
fledgling
lactobacillus
infection
not
outright
bad
yet
but
easily
far
substandard
for
bells
to
my
delight
the
richness
wasnt
excessive
and
im
pretty
intolerant
of
such
things
to
me
it
hit
but
didnt
pass
the
cloyingly
sweet
line
making
it
enjoyable
it
actually
may
be
a
tad
thin
aroma
was
limited
with
initial
breadiness
passing
to
a
heavier
malt
quality
with
some
sweetness
without
it
being
excessive
deep
amber
with
orange
and
red
hues
making
mostly
brown
clear
felt
the
warmth
quickly
but
that
may
be
because
my
stomach
is
mostly
empty
some
fruitiness
some
richness
somewhat
complex
worth
sampling
as
a
dopplebock
and
its
better

how
to

though
a
touch
astrigent
in

doppels
go
its
a
fair
interpretation
but
is
not
going
to
knock
you
off
normally
getting
the
german

that
we
all
rave
about
i
just
cant
dig
doppelbocks
yet
unless
this
is
an
off

i
enjoyed

this

0
is
noticeable
in
this
beer
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
caramel
note
like
salvator
or
celebrator
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
there
the
aftertaste
just
says
alcohol
like
a
more
subtle
shot
of
vodka
maybe
ive
got
an
old
bottle
of
something
since
i
got
this
at
a
place
that
is
prone
to
put
old
stock
on
the
floor
i
think
ill
stick
to
the
better
stouts
of
bells
hazy
yeasty
orangey
umber
i
dont
decant
color
very
yellow
creamy
head
of
18
of
an
inch
coats
but
doesnt
lace
the
glass
very
well
an
orange
oil
aroma
with
a
faint
malty
clove
tone
as
well
chocolate
covered
pear
flavors
a
bit
of
spice
and
mid
mouth
smokey
bitterness
with
a
surprisingly
hoppy
citrus
finish
that
steers
this
beer
well
away
from
the
somewhat
cloying
stickiness
thats
a
territory
many
doppels
can
flirt
with
lighter
bodied
but
consistant
feel
front
to
back
this
is
certainly
a
different
take
on
the
style
but
unlike
other
doppelbocks
in
name
only
like
leinenkugels
it
has
complexity
and
good
flavors
i
admit
to
expecting
a
bigger
brew
though
on
rereview
2005
i
have
to
stand
next
to
my
initial
impressions
this
is
an
odd
dopplebock
but
still
a
good
brew
bananas
are
still
here
which
is
not
acceptable
in
this
style
and
the
whisky
impression
is
prominent
smoke
this
year
is
hardly
there
this
is
odd
for
the
style
but
has
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
and
seems
to
have
softened
up
compared
to
previous
years
overall
this
has
to
be
an
infected
beer
this
is
the
second
kalamazoo
product
that
i
have
tried
that
was
sour
i
have
also
had
two
that
were
excellent
no
way
they
can
be
proud
of
this
product
i
will
give
them
another
try
in
six
to
nine
months
i
once
tastetested
this
against
a
regional
version
leinies
big
butt
doppelbock
it
was
like
godzilla
vs
bambi
a
huge
letdown

this
doppelbock

out
to
a
very
nice
dark
ruby
color
with
a
creamy

the
head
looked
good
enough
to
eat
nice
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
with
enough
hops
to
trip
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
back
to
earth
a
very

tastes
like

through
if
you
look
hard
enough
dopplebocks
are
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
is
a
good
one
right
up
there
with
celebrator
s
a
and
sprecher
good
attempt
at
a
german
classic
overall
time
to
invest
in
a
six
pack
probably
the
best
doppelbock
ive
had
to
date
and
by
far
the
best
wasatch
beer
ive
tried

recommended
poured
from
a

a
dark

with
a

of

malts
taste
is
malts
dark
breads
a
touch
of
sweetness
at
the
finish
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer

no
thank
you
draft
good
looking
medium
to
dark
brown
with
a
touch
of
mahogany
minimal
head
that
didnt
last
not
much
of
a
smell
but
predominantly
sweetcouldnt
say
specifics
taste
is
a
bit
on
sweet
side
too
clean
smooth
tasty
decent
texture
alcohol
wasnt
present
much
in
taste
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
drink
it
again
in
fact
i
did
order
a
second
and
my
friend
had
three
i
would
drink
this
as
an
easy
social
beer
or
in
a
restaurant
with
my
meal
instead
of
a
shiner
or
dark
vienna
lager
must
have
been
a
bad
batch
did
not
taste
good
drain
pour
was
not
a
fan
first
the
smell
reminded
me
of
the
smell
of
throwup
at
a
college
party
and
the
taste
got
worse
with
each
sip
was
not
a
fan
may
have
been
the
batch
but
smelled
and
tasted
unbelievably
funky
had
one
a
piper
down
a
few
weeks
ago
and
enjoyed
it
rich
and
smooth
v
bought
single
not
sure
of
6
pack
pricing
conclusion
a
very
nice
american
double
bock
true
to
style
and
doesnt
get
off
track
or
flavorless
like
some
american
interpretations
do
harder
to
pull
off
and
earns
my
respect
could
be
more
complex
but
i
would
much
rather
it
taste
good
and
simple
like
this
than
compromise
true
flavors
for
increased
complexity
the
original
and
classic
german
versions
are
better
than
pretty
much
any
american
versions
but
this
is
worthy
of
respect
and
i
would
drink
it
all
the
time
had
on
tap

great

described
this

i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
didnt
have
too
high
of
hopes
after
trying
polygamy
porter
last
night
devastator
is
a
much
better
crafter
beer
nice
toasty

sweetness
that
brings
a
good
kick
of
maltiness
without
being
cloying
smooth
and
drinkable
even
at
8
great
job
o
overall
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
decided
to
try
it
because
it
was
almost
sold
out
at
the
local
specs
but
there
could
have
been
another
reason
for
that
after
i
got
home
i
noticed
my
receipt
they
only
charged
me
1
25
for
a
six
pack
who
knows
why
this
was
the
last
one
on
the
shelf
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
i
dont
dorm
to
many
craft
lagers
but
this
one
i
would
purchase
again
dark
brown
in
color
with
great
clarity

fingernail
of
khaki
colored
head
obverse
three
quarters
of
the

the
aroma
is
comprised
of
dark
maltchocolateand
sourdough
bread
the
flavor
is
chocolatedark
maltwith
a
bit
of
a
sourdough
component
the
mouth
is
moderately
carbonated
and
smooth
the
devastator
is
just
that
if
one
tries
to
session
having
this
in
park
city
during
our
vacation
the
8
abv
makes
it
a
toughy
but
it
was
quite
flavorful
beer
there
was
hints
of
caramel
and
molasses
in
the
taste
with
a
backdrop
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
full
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
solid
offering
from
wasatch
great
drinker
excellent
at
high
altitude
warm
amber
color
strong
clean
taste
on
the
palate
minimal
hop
taste
but
subtle
and
invites
exploration
pairs
with
most
everything
should
be
exported
outside
utah
sucks
at
tap
abv
head
does
not
last
long
enough
question
choice
in
yeast
overall
its
really
hard
to
go
wrong
with
a
dopplebock
in
general
with
a
name
like
devastator
it
cant
be
a
bad
beer
i
have
no
complaints
with
this
brew
i
have
had
better
dopplebocks
but
taste
is
a
matter
of
opinion
if
youre
debating
getting
this
beer
go
ahead
and
give
it
a
try
its
tasty
and
goes
down
almost
too
easy
considering
its
8
abv
c
othis
is
a
pretty
simple
brew
i
kept
waiting
for
more
complexity
or
depth
but
each
sip
stayed
fairly
uninspired
there
were
hints
of
greatness
with
the
tobacco
and
ripe
dark
fruits
of
the
smell
but
those
faded
quickly
as
the
brew
warmed
i
could
have
used
more
cocoa
or
deeper
fruit
flavors
hohum
overall
matches
the
heavy
malt
bill
of
most
doppelbocks
but
lacks
the
integration
of
some
of
the
better
ones
and
is
definitely
not
in
the
same
class
as
ayinger
if
you
like
doppelbocks
then
give
it
a
try
if
not
you
can
pass
overalla
solid
doppelbock
that
is
dangerously
drinkable
this
one
is
good
and
sweet
but
not
overly
complex
i
will
pick
this
up
again
at
some
point
this
is
a
pretty
nice
offering
and
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewery
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
what
theyre
capable
of
with
other
styles
overall
a
sweeter
and
rather
pleasantly
fruity
tasting
dopplebock
it
was
rather
enjoyable
overall
and
one
to
try
if
you
get
the
chance
o
this
is
a
good
dopplebock
my
first
wasatch
brew
was
a
good
choice
taste
has
a
candyesque
sweetness
supplemented
by
slightly
burnt
caramel
and
toast
alcohol
is
well
hidden
up
front
but
flashes
a
slight
sting
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
modest
for
a
doppel
and
the
carbonation
is
finebubbled
i
dont
really
like
the
nearburnt
bready
alcohol
finish
it
is
a
little
acrid
its
a
passable
doppel
but
it
might
be
awhile
until
i
grab
a
sixer
of
this
at
the
store
a
solid
definitely
aboveaverage
doppelbock
i
like
it
its
main
faults
are
that
it
doesnt
measure
up
to
the
best
in
depth
and
complexity
but
its
tasty
this
brew
is
nice
and
malty
with
a
slight
sweet
tone
to
it
that
is
smooth
really
smooth
and
i
think
that
is
what
the
definition
of
this
beer
is
smooth
i
really
dont
have
much
to
say
beyond
that
really
o
o
pretty
good
doppelback
but
doesnt
really
stand
out
alcohol
is
not
apparent
just
a
bit
too
thin
rjt
unremarkable
beer
nothing
wrong
with
that
but
i
feel
no
need
to
visit
this
beer
again
3
5
d
tasty
beer
but
pretty
standard
doppelbock
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
dark
hue
with
a
solid
head
and
lots
o
lacing
nose
is
basic
and
not
so
exceptional
flavor
is
thick
syrupy
and
full
characterized
by
malt
and
a
cloying
sweetness
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
quaff
its
a
clear
tannish
red
with
a
small
amount
of
foam
the
aroma
was
plum
and
caramel
the
taste
was
rasin
canelope
more
on
the
earthy
side
the
taste
and
body
seemed
a
tad
thin
for
the
style
sepecially
for
an
8
brew
after
finishing
the
glass
i
might
debate
it
isnt
really
8
since
i
didnt
really
feel
the
alcohol
i
would
probably
have
this
again
i
mostly
chose
it
because
it
was
one
of
the
few
items
on
the
menu
i
havent
tried
yet
o
hard
to
really
say
much
more
about
this
one
a
solid
enough
double
bock
but
nothing
that
would
make
me
really
remember
this
or
rush
out
to
buy
it
again
t
the
abv
is
perfect
but
it
is
rather
simple
for
a
double
bock
caramel
toasted
grains
a
touch
of
honey
and
lemon
in
the
aftertaste
devastator
is
devastating
could
use
a
little
more
flavor
but
it
is
drinkable
for
its
strength
and
fairly
tasty
a
boozed
up
malt
bomb
here
pours
a
bright
clear
copper
color
with
a
small
just
off
white
head
smells
like
german
malts
and
a
candy
sweetness
the
sugars
are
less
intense
in
the
taste
but
the
malts
are
diverse
earthy
thick
and
lasting
hard
to
place
this
one
exactly
similar
to
one
of
the
troegs
bock
beers
out
there
maybe
like
a
lesser
version
of
the
troegenator
even
feel
is
fine
average
carbonation
and
a
bigger
than
medium
body
really
cool
artwork
on
the
bottle
and
well
priced
for
an
8
brew
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
but
im
glad
i
tried
this
tasty
even
if
it
does
not
show
off
that
much
depth
very
clean
and
almost
too
easy
to
drink
for
an
8

well
done

pretty
thin
for

on
the
palate
overall
not
impressed
this
seems
to
me
like
maybe
a
regular
dark
bock
not
a
dopplebock
overall
its
a
solid
beer
but
a
bit
pricey
for
what
you
get
and
not
terribly
interesting
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
it
up
again
though
i
may
recommend
it
to
a
friend
thats
not
generally
into
darker
beer
but
wants
to
try
one
overall
this
wasnt
bad
but
it
didnt
fit
its
style
imo
i
really
think
it
tasted
more
like
a
scotchscottishwee
heavy
than
a
doppelbock
but
not
a
bad
choice
if
you
get
the
chance
thanks
to
rim
liquor
for
this
one
pours
a
orangeamber
color
with

soapy

is
very
malty
with
caramel
and
honey
undertones
in
the
taste
some
toffee
caramel
brown
sugar
but
not
too
sweet
balanced
with
little
hint
of
alcohol
smooth
medium
bodied
feel
overall
a
tasty
and
deceivingly
strong
bock
too
much
could
prove
devastating
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
not
what
i
expected
at
all
its
more
of
a
tripel
or
quad
then
any
other
style
of
beer
this
beer
has
a
big
feel
to
it
and
is
definitely
a
sipper
a
very
enjoyable
beer
if
your
in
the
mood
for
something
this
crazy
o
a
pleasant
enough
beer
to
drink
but
not
a
great
doppelbock
theyve
got
the
maltforward
aspect
right
but
its
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
and
theres
definitely
an
old
ale
character
to
it
handsome
dark
amber
in
the
glass
fragrant
with
some
dark
fruit
in
the
nose
the
odd
perfumey
flavor
with
an
earthy
aftertaste
is
not
one
i
care
for
at
all
o
a
decent
beer
a
bit
to
sweet
in
my
opinion
its
slightly
complex
havent
had
many
doppelbocks
to
compare
to
so
take
what
i
say
with
a
grain
of
salt
meh
served
at
a
good
temperature
and
with
an
average
sized
light
tan
head
and
a
bit
of
lace
color
was
a
clear
dark
amber
aroma
is
malt
caramel
solvents
flavor
is
sweet
on
top
then
like
nose
and
some
carbonic
tang
body
is
ok
ditto
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
of
average
length
but
with
the
lingering
solvent
sweet
thing
the
label
is
a
little
weird
with
the
big
love
from
the
land
of
zion
doubt
ill
be
having
another
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pilsener
glass
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
very
malt
as
is
expected
i
get
some
toffee
and
bread
notes
as
well
as
some
vinous
notes
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
a
lot
of
toffee
and
a
little
bread
as
well
as
some
grapelike
fruit
notes
that
mix
very
well
with
the
malt
the
alcohol
is
detectable
but
not
overwhelming
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
nice
doppelbock
it
is
an
okay
american
dark
lager
overall
a
different
kinda
doppelbock
one
that
i
really
enjoy
i
originally
bought
it
for
the
cool
label
but
the
taste
and
alcohol
gives
you
a
nice
buzz
happy
labor
day
yall
this
is
a
big
beer
which
i
think
holds
its
own
against
any
other
in
the
style
i
could
drink
this
all
year
long
but
am
looking
forward
to
a
few
of
these
in
the
fall
another
great
point
to
make
was
that
this
was
a
relatively
inexpensive
beer
especially
for
what
you
get
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
again
the
body
wasnt
as
full
as
i
like
for
the
style
but
that
kinda
helped
drinkability
the
beer
was
pretty
smooth
and
went
down
pretty
easily
overall
a
solid
example
of
the
style
i
wouldnt
mind
having
more
of
these
and
if
it
were
local
to
me
it
would
be
a
semiregular
for
me
worth
trying
when
you
get
the
chance
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
slightly
more
of
a
caramel
taste
than
i
was
hoping
for
smells
like
pecans
just
like
another
astute
ba
already
pointed
out
also
i
get
a
vague
honeyed
smoke
scent
off
this
one
odd
its
almost
as
if
it
couldnt
decide
on
whether
to
be
a
rauchbier
or
a
doppelbock
hides
the
abv
perfectly
and
has
pretty
decent
body
texture
but
the
flavor
is
much
weaker
than
the
nose
hinted
at
the
shortest
finish
on
any
craft
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
and
in
this
case
that
is
a
bad
thing
because
the
sweet
malt
that
is
there
is
quite
delicious
just
a
total
mismatch
to
what
the
nose
is
telling
me
is
all
medium
brown
cloudy
body
minimal
effervescence
almost
still
little
if
any
head
resulted
in
no
lacing
caramel
malts
in
the
nose
and
wet
cardboard
ugh
no
plumpruneraisin
esters
a
bit
of
burnt
brown
sugar
not
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
mouthfeel
is
pretty
watery
no
stickiness
no
go
wont
do
this
again
on
the
low
end
of
the
tasting
scoring
imho
not
very
good
poured
a
dark
orange
color
beer
with
an
average
size
head
which
quickly
dissipated
it
smelled
of
burnt
caramel
brown
sugar
honey
yeast
it
tasted
of
wheat
honey
tea
yeast
toffee
and
some
malt
cant
taste
the
alcohol
generally
this
can
be
good
or
bad
in
this
case
it
is
bad
because
the
beer
just
seem
slightly
flat
with
a
weird
aftertaste
doesnt
stay
true
to
its
style
drink
average
dopplebock
and
i
was
expecting
it
not
too
suprised
nice
to
try
for
a
state
not
known
for
beer
overall
a
pretty
decent
brew
but
not
very
intriguing
in
terms
of
its
taste
taste
was
of
pecans
and
roasted
nuts
tasted
much
sweeter
than
a
normal
double
bock
almost
seemed
like
it
was
a
straight
up
pecan
beer
mouthfeel
was
decent
lost
some
carbonation
as
i
kept
drinking
overall
not
impressed
was
a
slightly
below
average
double
bock
that
was
too
sweet
and
didnt
keep
carbonation
long
enough
the
alcohol
was
not
detectable
which
was
a
good
thing
in
my
opinion
poured
into
pint
glass
with
very
light
head
and
a
moderate
amber
color
light
malt
smell
taste
a
bit
sweet
light
malt
flavor
before
you
know
it
you
are
ready
for
another
drink
because
the
taste
is
gone
definitely
a
week
doppel
but
very
drinkable
no
hint
that
it
is
an
8
so
a
positive
there
would
chose
another
one
to
drink
while
out
in
a
bar
but
i
would
not
have
to
have
another
sweet
toffee
alcohol
is
well
hidden
short
with
flavors
well
blended
could
use
some
more
biscuity
and
cereal
notes
that
i
enjoy
in
most
doppelbocks
lots
of
chocolate
covered
notes
in
the
taste
as
well
as
the
smell
light
and
sweet
d
an
easy
drinker
for
its
weight
but
it
doesnt
make
me
lust
for
more
sub
oar
in
any
regard
not
a
dopplebock
and
not
all
that
enjoyable
not
something
i
would
recommend
decent
example
of
a
dopplebock
but
theres
nothing
special
enough
here
to
warrant
a
second
purchase
quite
easy
to
drink
for
an
8
0
but
still
no
real
need
to
as
there
are
a
multitude
of
better
choices
in
this
style
opinion
well
if
you
read
my
review
you
would
know
that
this
beer
disappointed
me
i
am
really
critical
of
this
style
as
this
is
what
i
primarily
brew
and
drink
but
i
regularly
drink
the
classic
examples
i
live
in
texas
where
the
origin
of
this
misguided
bock
characterization
has
occurred
so
i
am
no
stranger
to
drinking
a
brown
lager
that
has
the
words
bock
printed
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
you
dont
typically
find
that
with
a
brewer
that
will
print
double
bock
on
the
bottle
but
that
is
what
you
have
with
this
beer
it
is
the
same
americanized
version
of
the
bock
style
but
the
alcohol
is
cranked
up
a
bit
so
i
guess
they
printed
double
on
the
side
i
will
stick
to
my
weihenstephaner
korbinian
and
leave
this
on
the
shelves
for
someone
who
just
wants
a
quick
buzz
with
no
real
bock
flavor
d
good
with
the
exception
of
that
weird
aftertaste
some
room
for
improvement
here
that
8
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
flavor
i
drank
this
one
like
a
much
smaller
beer
i
can
see
how
it
could
have
devastating
effects
over
the
course
of
the
night
i
only
have
one
bottle
though
so
that
was
not
a
problem
for
me
pretty
good
beer
though
mouthfeeldrinkability
medium
bodied
and
smooth
drinking
i
really
like
this
beer
simple
solid
flavors
that
are
really
pleasing
definitely
my
favorite
of
the
3
beers
i
had
while
waiting
for
my
flight
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
was
very
tasty
i
would
really
enjoy
this
as
a
premeal
beer
or
perhaps
with
some
pork
decent
taste
nutty
malts
not
too
overpowering
for
8
alcohol
for
the
lack
of
head
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasing
and
suprisingly
carbinated
i
think
the
drinkability
is
very
good
although
you
need
to
be
carefull
due
to
the
alcohol
content
drinkability
is
good
and
this
is
evidenced
by
all
of
the
drunk
utah
hipsters
raving
about
this
beer
i
though
it
was
alright
wasatchs
devastator
double
bock
is
a
solid
interpretation
of
the
style
that
might
have
earned
higher
scores
across
the
board
if
i
was
more
of
a
doppelbock
dude
please
take
that
into
account
and
buy
accordingly
this
doppelbock
lacks
heavily
in
the
nose
and
taste
department
the
sweetness
is
overpowering
overly
lingering
and
also
not
of
the
rich
dark
heavy
breadfruitnut
flavors
that
i
associate
with
the
best
of
these
with
this
high
of
an
abv
as
well
i
dont
see
myself
having
many
12

bottle
proclaims
that
this
beer
will
earn
some
big
love
and
that
utah
will
never

o
as
i
read
the
style
description
this
one
fits
on
that
dark
end
tending
towards
stout
there
isnt
much
bitterness
in
the
flavor
but
the
beer
does
balance
out
better
in
the
end
oive
wanted
to
try
this
beer
for
some
time
it
turned
out
to
be
a
tasty
beer
this
is
one
i
would
like
to
reexamine
at
some
point
color
is
a
deep
brown
with
a
slightly
earthy
sweet
smell
the
taste
is
a
sweet
raisin
and
toasted
malt
rich
flavor
with
traces
of
citrus
behind
the
two
main
flavors
and
a
nice
heavy
but
smooth
finish
tastes
very
good
and
potent
o
i
think
victory
did
the
monks
proud
deep
red
in
color
with
orange
hues
and
perfect
clarity
poured
with
a
rich
offwhite
foam
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
that
left
a
thick
ring
and
sheets
of
sticky
lacings
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
smoked
and
dark
grain
aromas
with
sweet
fruit
fruit
in
the
background
medium
bodied
slighty
syrupy
feel
at
first
followed
by
tight
slightly
aggressive
carbonation
dark
and
slighly
charred
malt
flavors
up
front
followed
by
chocolate
malt
with
dark
fruit
flavors
beneath
herbal
hop
bitterness
toward
the
end
followed
by
smoky
tobaccolike
flavors
and
sweetripe
fruit
fabulous
flavors
and
aromas
make
this
an
amazing
dopplebock
overall
absolutely
delicious
and
perfect
for
this
never
ending
winter
what
a
doppelbock
should
be
oa
solid
doppelbock
nice
flavor
and
very
pleasant
to
sip
a
great
doppelbock
that
would
probably
have
greater
recognition
if
it
made
it
to
more
markets
the
flavors
are
righton
for
a
good
doppelbock
but
the
extra
bitterness
kind
of
kills
it
for
me
this
was
an
excellent
presentation
of
the
style
very
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
i
will
have
to
add
this
to
one
of
my
favorites
from
vicotry
i
stand
by
my
german
brewers
with
making
my
favorite
dopplebocksaventinus
celebrator
optimator
but
victory
did
really
well
here
i
would
absolutely
buy
this
again
a
wellmade
example
ouch
i
did
not
like
this
one
while
victory
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
this
flavor
didnt
cut
it
for
me
my
guess
is
that
dopplebock
is
not
a
blend
i
should
frequent
just
too
much
of
a
dry
brown
stouty
kind
of
beer
for
me
that
i
found
boring
and
nontasty
seems
dopplebock
fans
may
like
this
one
so
dont
let
my
review
keep
you
from
this
one
if
you
are
a
dopplebock
fan
o
very
delicious
beer
another
enjoyable
brew
from
my
favorite
brewing
company
moreys
bottom
line
another
solid
albeit
lesser
known
beer
from
victory
this
is
a
really
good
beer
ive
had
quite
a
few
double
bocks
and
this
one
is
up
there
with
some
of
the
better
ones
overall
pretty
solid
and
enjoyable
but
lacking
in
body
and
fullness
in
the
feel
otherwise
poured
a
chestnut
color
with
amber
hues
with
a
sparsely
lacing
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malts
roasted
nuts

slightly
sweet

the
taste

bready
grassy
with
a
somewhat
bitter

medium
mouthfeel
moderately
carbonated
and
pretty
easily
drinkable
poured
into
glass
briskly
to
create
a
nice
rocky

head
that
lasts
awhile
and
fades
to
cover

with

medium
to

creamy
texture
and
an
almost
lively
carbonation
well
worth
a
taste
again
enjoyed
a
nicely
done
doppelbock
very
malty
and
flavorful
well
worth
picking
up
if
you
get
the
chance
o
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
i
am
very
happy
i
picked
it
up
i
am
very
impressed
by
the
complexity
cant
wait
to
get
more
in
spite
of
the
abv
i
enjoyed
several
of
these
sweet
but
not
overly
so
a
nice
sessionable
brew
wow
very
creamy
and
tasty
this
is
a
tremendous
dopplebock
very
sessionable
and
case
worthy
a
i
like
it
wellenough
but
the
grape
sweetnesskoolaid
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
for
this
style
id
rather
have
a
hearty
toasted
spicybready
flavor
for
my
doppelbock
a
little
bit
all
over
the
place
some
high
points
some
lows
as
well
overall
this
isnt
my
favorite
from
victory
but
it
feels
old
school
and
for
that
i
respect
it
also
not
my
favorite
style
admittedly
but
other
doppelbocks
that
ive
had
are
not
like
this
definitely
one
to
try
for
those
of
you
into
the
style
you
wont
regret
its
uniqueness
overall
extremely
tasty
complexity
of
aroma
substantial
body
maltiness
w
balance
and
it
begs
you
to
have
another
sip
definitely
one
of
my
new
favorites
thanks
for
the
trade
curious
monk
o
what
a
delicious
beer
lots
of
malty
goodness
and
pretty
much
everything
i
think
a
doppelbock
is
supposed
to
be
and
executed
brilliantly
this
doppelbock
pours
out
with
a
nice
brown
colored
body
the
head
was
a
tan
color
that
was
kind
of
fizzy
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
good
malty
aroma
with
some
soft
yeast
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
pretty
good
theres
a
softness
to
the
taste
the
flavors
are
mostly
sweet
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
overall
not
a
bad
brew
nice
looking
bock
from
victory
dark
brown
with
shades
of
amber
and
a
respectable
foamy
head
smells
of
malty
goodness
palate
is
complex
and
robust
yet
very
traditional
layers
of
bready
malt
flavor
and
a
touch
of
fermented
dark
fruit
are
complimented
by
a
clean
german
yeast
that
adds
to
the
depth
of
flavor
full
bodied
with
a
clean
finish
another
wonderfully
brewed
germanstyle
lager
from
pa
overall
great
brew
i
like
this
one
a
lot
and
enjoy
pondering
how
it
evolves
throughout
the
drink
i
should
make
a
point
to
pick
up
more
of
these
before
they
are
gone
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
solid
doppelbock
i
will
defiantly
be
on
the
look
out
for
this
one
again
and
i
would
recommend
it
for
anyone
who
loves
doppelbocks
german
beers
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
tumbler
poured
redorange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
and
dark
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
coffee
dark
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
subtle
sweet
alcohol
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
wow
where
did
all
of
that
flavor
come
from
based
on
the
aroma
i
would
have
not
expected
there
to
be
much
going
on
in
this
one
it
was
definitely
a
pleasant
surprise
when
i
took
my
first
sip
the
flavor
is
really
as
that
saved
this
one
for
me
as
the
aroma
was
very
weak
in
intensity
worth
trying
for
the
flavor
but
that
is
about
it
im
not
sure
where
ba
got
the
abv
fjgure
of
8
5
as
the
victory
web
site
lists
the
abv
for
this
beer
at
7
6
but
in
either
case
it
is
hidden
very
well
and
makes
this
a
very
enjoyable
brew
d
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
definitely
a
nice
change
of
pace
though
pours
a
clean
orangeish
to
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
roasty
caramel
and
a
small
presence
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
caramel
roasted
malt
with
a
small
presence
of
earth
and
hops
a
small
hop
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
sticky
caramel
like
aftertaste
big
caramel
and
a
bit
sticky
sweet
small
boozyness
and
a
nice
mellow
hop
d
there
really
is
no
reason
to
skip
over
this
one
highly
recommended
and
a
nice
surprise
overall
this
is
a
solid
and
filling
beer
but
the
weight
and
the
higher
abv
would
help
me
limit
it
a
little
bit
and
i
likely
wouldnt
drink
more
than
2
of
these
on
any
given
night
a
simple
beer
that
has
been
done
very
well
o
this
has
pretty
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
smooth
and
has
nice
flavor
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
but
not
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
that
ive
had
so
far
i
enjoyed
it
though
and
id
drink
it
again
st
victorious
pours
a
deep
clear
maroon
plentiful
cherry
highlights
shine
through
when
the
beer
is
backlit
though
the
ivory
head
rises
to
about
2
5
fingers
in
height
before
slowing
collapsing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
not
much
is
left
in
the
way
of
lacing
though
the
nose
doesnt
quite
hit
all
the
marks
of
a
great
doppel
but
its
still
pretty
good
its
an
almost
even
blend
of
milk
chocolate
and
plummy
dark
fruits
on
my
palate
the
beer
gains
a
slight
nuttiness
but
at
the
expense
of
that
creamy
milk
chocolate
from
the
nose
morphing
into
a
more
bitter
roasted
dark
chocolate
which
doesnt
really
work
for
me
int
he
context
of
the
style
the
flavors
also
a
touch
weak
and
watered
down
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
enough
to
cut
through
the
malt
while
simultaneously
remaining
in
the
background
and
letting
those
malts
take
center
stage
the
body
though
is
way
thin
for
the
style
when
im
expecting
a
big
malt
bomb
of
a
beer
theres
a
certain
richness
to
the
body
that
should
come
along
here
and
this
beer
doesnt
even
come
close
to
that
ive
enjoyed
most
of
the
other
offerings
from
victory
that
ive
had
but
st
victorious
ranks
as
a
fairly
disappointing
doppelbock
for
me
this
pours
crystal
clear
brown
very
slight
lacing
the
smell
is
brown
sugar
but
a
lot
of
malt
in
the
smell
and
flavor
as
well
it
is
a
nice
german
style
flavor
great
malt
flavor
really
good
there
is
a
lot
of
sweetness
but
for
the
abv
there
is
a
decent
balance
to
this
it
is
maybe
a
little
syrupy
but
the
mediumheavy
body
is
actually
pretty
tolerable
this
one
seems
different
from
the
authentic
dopplers
you
see
from
deutchland
but
i
think
theyve
done
a
great
job
of
keeping
the
flavor
but
giving
it
a
unique
twist
well
made
and
very
enjoyable
for
me
among
my
favorites
of
the
style
a
dark
ambergolden
red
no
head
with
minimal
lacing
a
lot
of
booze
and
caramel
dark
fruits
some
dates
a
faint
hint
of
bakers
chocolate
roasted
malts
a
lot
of
toasted
caramel
maltsroasted
and
dried
out
fruits
raisins
and
dates
a
sweet
and
smooth
caramel
finish
dry
and
faintly
tangy
but
it
has
a
sweet
backing
st
victorious
pours
with
a
dark
golden
color
with
little
head
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
and
bread
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
slightly
sweet
malty
flavor
maybe
a
little
tartness
folowing
the
sweetness
this
beer
has
a
pleasantly
heavy
bready
feel
theres
a
nice
warming
feeling
as
it
goes
down
no
doubt
the
alcohol
i
really
like
this
seasonal
from
victory
good
stuff
overall
this
was
definitely
a
nice
little
bock
i
could
have
drank
this
one
all
night
and
it
just
seemed
to
be
really
well
done
for
fans
of
the
style
this
was
definitely
a
good
choice
i
would
have
to
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
who
likes
a
good
dark
german
beer
well
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
a
little
warming
but
normal
for
the
style
i
thought
this
was
a
rock
solid
american
take
on
the
style
overall
impression
this
one
really
hit
me
out
of
the
blue
sometimes
buying
a
single
is
a
good
idea
this
is
not
one
of
those
times

i

making
for
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer

good
i
enjoyed

flavors

good
version
of
the

good
beer

where
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
with
a
beautiful
creamy
head
the
head
is
dense
and
doesnt
diminish
smells
a
bit
rich
and
malty
booze
sweet
and
yet
tart
cherries
chocolate
is
predominately
upfront
and
is
the
first
notable
flavor
this
is
followed
by
some
sweet
and
tart
cherries
hops
are
barely
noticeable
but
the
finish
is
a
bit
dry
thick
rich
chewy
malts
chocolate
and
a
light
tart
cherry
are
the
most
notable
flavors
st
victorious
is
a
really
impressive
release
from
victory
brewing
company
its
an
excellent
take
on
the
doppelbock
style
and
could
easily
be
confused
with
an
authentic
german
doppelbock
it
has
a
ton
of
flavor
and
really
delivers
in
just
about
every
way
i
wouldnt
mind
a
little
more
body
but
i
cant
complain
excellent
stuff
seek
it
out
revisiting
this
one
due
to
pleasant
memories
from
back
east
it
pours
a
clear
ruby
garnet
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
light
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
rye
bread
wheat
light
cocoa
and
light
maple
syrup
the
rye
really
brings
a
good
amount
of
breadiness
to
the
aroma
the
taste
follows
the
nose
pretty
closely
with
a
mild
touch
of
roasted
malts
thrown
in
to
compliment
the
aforementioned
rye
breadiness
the
cocoa
has
morphed
into
some
slightly
bitter
dark
chocolate
as
well
creating
a
light
coffee
flavor
in
the
back
it
all
comes
together
rather
nicely
the
body
is
a
svelte
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
nice

the

this
is
a
unique
and
enjoyable
dopplebock
one
i
could
certainly
see
myself
ordering
again
again
this
is
probably
the
best
us
made
dopplebock
ive
had
i
keep
seeing
people
mentioning
troeggenator
dopplebock
the
troegs
bock
is
good
but
it
just
doesnt
have
the
same
german
character
that
this
one
does
well
done
drinkability
alcohol
hidden
well
could
definitely
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
not
something
you
are
going
to
polish
off
45
in
one
go
but
thats
not
the
idea
d
i
have
had
a
few
victory
beers
and
i
have
loved
them
this
did
not
fail
me
wonderful
brew
and
if
you
love
dopplebocks
treat
yourself
and
give
this
feast
a
try
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
and
the
delightful
pa
madegerman
style
beer
will
warm
your
spirit
a
decent
example
at
best
theres
something
holding
me
back
from
really
enjoying
this
beer
but
i
definitely
respect
it
deep
mahogany
colored
with
a
low
head
of
light
brown
foam
low
aroma
of
lightly
roasted
malt
and
marshmallow
some
nutty
notes
rich
and
complex
flavors
of
cocoa
and
coffee
plus
caramel
and
slight
woody
notes
some
root
beer
marshmallow
full
and
even
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
slight
warming
of
the
cheeks
very
tasty
great
beer
and
very
drinkable
despite
the
strength
st
victorious
has
a
lot
of
good
things
going
for
it
it
has
a
complex
mixture
of
wheat
and
dark
fruit
hints
to
it
however
i
was
quite
disappointed
that
these
tastes
werent
balanced
well
with
the
alcohol
to
any
beer
or
doppelbock
newcomer
who
may
be
reading
this
to
decide
on
which
doppelbock
to
try
first
i
highly
recommend
trying
troegenator
by
tröegs
brewing
co
first
db
flavorful
but
it
is
strong
and
a
bit
medicinal
to
me
it
feels
a
bit
out
of
balance
and
just
doesnt
drink
smoothly
in
my
personal
opinion
not
bad
but
there
are
other
style
examples
i
would
drink
before
this
from
the
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
brown
cloudy
color
with
a
thin
to
medium
cap
of
foam
the
appearance
isnt
bad
but
isnt
the
beers
strongest
suit
the
aroma
is
where
the
goodness
begins
sweet
malty
grains
envelop
the
nostrils
in
waves
the
malt
and
grain
on
the
palate
produce
a
moist
and
pleasing
mouthfeel
sweetness
rises
but
is
then
replaced
by
dry
bitter
hops
as
the
beer
moves
toward
the
back
the
hops
provide
ample
balance
to
the
blast
of
malt
neither
the
malt
nor
the
hops
becomes
overwhelming
making
this
brew
highly
drinkable
the
complexity
of
the
malt
is
the
real
show
here
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
cola
like
color
that
is
clear
with
a
slight
tan
head
which
gives
way
to
ver
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
has
a
caramel
and
breadiness
back
bone
with
hints
of
the
dark
fruits
and
a
slight
chocolate
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
good
it
is
complex
enough
to
keep
your
interest
and
an
easy
enough
drink
to
not
deter
you
the
alochol
is
very
well
hidden
as
well
this
is
my
fourth
one
out
of
a
six
pack
over
a
few
days
and
the
ba
guys
have
their
reviews
right
on
the
mark
dark
raisin
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
extremely
drinkable
fantastic
with
zah
and
a
great
malty
head
i
feel
it
but
im
having
a
hard
time
figuring
out
where
the
alcohol
is
wow
im
going
to
have
to
get
another
6er
of
these
d
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
beer
not
my
typical
brew
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
dont
know
that
id
love
2
in
a
row
but
this
one
was
really
good
overall
a
decent
doppelbock
but
not
the
greatest
i
think
more
time
in
the
bottle
will
allow
it
to
balance
some
of
the
harsher
alcoholic
notes
out
and
let
the
malt
sing
pours
a
mahogany
brown
with
nice
clarity
and
a
thin
tan
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
the
aroma
is
deeply
malty
and
authentic
with
notes
of
molasses
and
turbinado
sugar
multigrain
bread
slight
smoke
herbal
hops
and
alcohol
the
flavor
is
similar
with
sugary
malt
upfront
notes
of
caramel
molasses
turbinado
sugar
along
with
some
toasted
bread
dark
fruits
herbal
hops
a
hint
of
smoke
and
some
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
smooth
and
drinkability
is
very
good
very
tasty
american
dopplebock
certainly
one
of
the
best
domestic
interpretations
d
a
big
potent
doppelbock
to
put
down
all
night
in
fact
youre
better
off
sampling
and
moving
on
the
sweetness
might
be
enough
to
deter
novice
palates
not
acclimated
to
the
rich
lager
style
otherwise
i
cant
complain
too
much
save
perhaps
its
balance
and
compromised
hop
balance
strength
makes
it
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
but
what
you
do
drink
goes
down
easily
and
enjoyably
very
good
and
would
definitely
have
again

overall
this
was

good
looking
great
smelling
beer
with
some
very
complex
flavors
only
downfall
was
how
filling
it
was
because
id
love
to
have
had
another
right
away

fantastic
example
of
the
style
from
a
consistently
good
brewery

st
victorious
wow
dopplebock
really
this
shocks
me
i
guess
it
makes
some
sense
but
im
still
shocked
overall
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
maybe
a
but
too
much
so
for
the
abv
one
of
my
favorites
from
victory
drinkability
a
pretty
decent
doppelbock
certainly
not
as
good
as
its
german
incarnations
but
a
decent
interpretation
id
certainly
have
it
again
definitely
worth
drinking
overall
exactly
what
you
expect
from
a
nice
doppelbock
drinkability
a
good
doppelbock
not
quite
as
good
as
the
real
german
ones
but
a
good
faithful
interpreation
d
a
real
enjoyable
beer
would
recommend
to
drink
it
during
the
late
summer
through
the
fall
final
thought
remarkably
modest
in
its
presentation
this
beer
knocks
your
socks
off
d
decent
beer
fairly
drinkable
dispite
its
high
abv
paired
very
nicely
with
some
pizza
dhigh
abv
so
this
is
one
i
would
probably
sip
on
more
than
anything
else
great
for
the
style
and
nice
in
terms
of
price
rediscovering
how
tasty
and
delightful
victorys
version
of
a
doppelbock
is
i
can
see
grabbing
a
sixer
of
this
dtwo
of
these
is
really
no
problem
a
great
full
bodied
lager
for
the
spring
time
despite
the
8
abv
there
really
isnt
much
evidence
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
or
mouthfeel
i
plan
on
picking
up
a
case
of
this
every
spring
while
im
in
pa
thought
this
was
going
to
be
decent
but
after
a
while
i
really
couldnt
find
enough
good
stuff
to
redeem
the
big
booze
flat
malts
in
this
one
very
unbalanced
not
into
it
id
give
it
another
chance
but
this
was
not
a
great
experience
overall
pretty
good
brew
from
victory
nothing
really
outstanding
but
i
do
like
it
pours
a
nice
medium
brown
color
with
a
decent
light
brown
head
nice
malty
aroma
with
burnt
brown
sugar
caramel
and
toffee
toasty
malt
flavors
along
with
raisins
toffee
and
caramel
a
very
nice
beer
with
a
bit
of
warming
alcohol
on
the
finish
one
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of

poured
a
medium
brown
color
ale
with
a
large
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
and
light
toffee
is
enjoyable
though
not
necessarily
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
doppelbock
taste
is
also
dominated
by
sweet
caramel
malt
notes
with
light
toffee
notes
as
well
some
notes
of
banana
bread
would
have
complemented
well
this
beer
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
well
done
though
lacking
usual
ester
doverall
this
was
a
good
beer
my
expectations
were
probably
higher
than
my
experience
but
good
overall
drinkability
it
wasnt
the
best
beer
i
tried
at
dld
but
it
hit
the
spot
on
that
cool
cloudy
day
d
easy
drinking
a
fine
example
of
the
style
a
very
enjoyable
malty
but
with
a
hop
touch
traditionalstyle
doppelbock
easy
to
drink
despite

warmth
and
overall
richness
complex
maltiness
with
a
hop
touch
in
the
finish
well
done
drinkability
very
good
and
complex
for
the
style
a
nice
bitter
aspect
i
could
have
a
couple
one
of
victorys
better
brews

this
just
reminds
me
why
i

i
could
sit

all

this
absolutely
wonderful

and
the
fact
that
two
or
three
and
id
be
on
the
floor
pours
a
wonderful
light
brown
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
disappears
very
quickly
malt
forward
to
the
nose
right
away
a
gentle
sweetness
and
mild
smokey
note
some
red
apple
cherry
and
caramel
as
well
very
nice
a
chewy
malt
bomb
that
does
not
cloy
the
throat
a
very
balanced
sweetness
that
drinks
so
well
for
the
style
victory
does
it
right
easily
one
of
the
best
americanmade
doppelbocks
victory
makes
some
excellent
beer
german
style
with
a
twist
here
its
the
smokiness
single
from
a
mixasix
pack
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
dark
auburn
color
with
orange
highlights
thin
head
which
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
smell
was
malty
and
boozy
taste
was
pretty
decent
lots
of
malt
flavor
the
biggest
gripe
i
have
with
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
extremely
sticky
on
the
palate
and
the
alcohol
profile
is
way
too
up
front
not
a
beer
that
i
would
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
an
average
beer
but
not
overly
enjoyable
to
drink
the
bestby
date
was
2011
and
if
i
had
a
second
bottle
i
would
try
aging
it
just
doesnt
seem
ready
to
drink
now
notes
thanks
to
bill
for
seeing
that
i
was
able
to
enjoy
this
great
beer
from
victory
a
brewery
with
a
nicely
rounded
lineup
of
beers
this
beer
is
awesome
dark
red
color
with
a
malty
aroma
the
taste
reveals
raisins
toffee
and
plenty
of
malts
there
is
a
slight
hoppiness
at
the
end
the
8
50
is
very
deceptive
as
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
doppelbocks
that
i
have
ever
had
and
i
highly
recommend
it
cheers
drinkability
if
it
wasnt
for
a
surprising
8

abv
i
wouldve
proclaimed
this
brew
sessionable
d
very
drinkable
the
thinner
mouthfeel
and
lack
of
a
supersweet
taste
makes
this
one
go
down
pretty
smoothly
d
very
good
i
never
prided
myself
on
being
a
doppelbock
fan
but
this
beer
could
have
me
looking
for
other
beers
of
the
same
category
an
interesting
doppelbock
definitely
more
dark
fruit
forward
than
malt
forward
didnt
really
care
for
it
the
winey
notes
and
dark
fruits
was
pretty
intense
id
prefer
more
of
a
bready
profile
na
zdravje
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
amber
with
a
dab
of
offwhite
lace
the
aroma
was
of
rich
caramel
malt
the
taste
was
of
caramel
malt
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
burn
and
a
medicinal
finish
the
feel
was
medium
and
wet
this
was
a
pleasant
enough
beer
just
nothing
that
really
made
it
stand
out
from
the
pack
d
i
am
enjoying
sipping
on
this
beer
while
watching
a
movie
but
i
could
see
putting
a
few
of
these
back
and
regretting
it
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
so
beware
almost
the
same
experience
as
with
troeganator
but
i
find
this
beer
has
so
much
more
complexity
to
offer
well
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
medium
goes
down
well
and
is
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
d
im
having
this
on
a
cold
winters
evening
as
snow
sleet
and
freezing
rain
pound
on
the
window
aside
from
a
roaring
fire
i
cant
think
of
anything
else
id
rather
have
right
now
very
nice
not
a
very
complex
beer
good
rich
malt
with
some
boozesoaked
fruit
some
brown
sweet
bread
nice
malty
finish
decent
but
not
one
that
sets
itself
from
the
pack
of
german
versions
or
even
some
domestics
the
carbonation
in
this
one
keeps
it
drinkable
and
in
some
way
masks
some
limitations
overall
id
have
this
again
but
it
wouldnt
be
the
first
id
reach
for
when
i
have
an
itch
to
drink
this
style
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
thick
creamy
head
looks
like
a
milkshake
almost
malt
is
the
first
smell
to
come
to
mind
has
a
break
like
quality
to
it
taste
is
also
malty
with
some
caramel
with
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
carbonation
seems
to
appear
at
the
end
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
at
all
hard
to
tell
it
is
over
8abv
feels
very
thick
in
the
mouth
and
has
a
little
burnt
flavor
to
it
that
is
nice
overall
a
really
good
beer
from
victory
and
one
i
would
definitely
buy
again
so
it
isnt
the
type
of
doppelbock
im
accustomed
to
but
that
shouldnt
stop
anyone
from
trying
this
beer
its
a
drier
more
drinkable
example
and
well
worth
the
purchase
overall
impression
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
this
is
the
only
style
of
lager
that
i
really
like
and
it
didnt
disappoint
that
said
this
beer
is
worth
looking
for
d
a
bit
too
drinkable
i
had
3
just
to
get
the
feel
of
this
one
could
easily
have
3
more
before
realizing
not
only
was
driving
a
prob
but
walking
would
be
difficult
as
well
def
doesnt
drink
like
a
8
5
abv
brew
a
great
take
on
the
style
from
an
am
brewery
the
complexity
of
the
malts
makes
for
an
interesting
and
tasty
beer
and
one
id
happily
drink
more
than
one
of
in
a
sitting
a
very
drinkable
beer
almost
scary
considering
the
alcohol
content
a
slight
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
balanced
nicely
by
the
subtle
hops
at
the
end
highly
recommended
d
well
blended
nice
representation
of
the
style
i
could
enjoy
another
pint
or
two
of
this
beer
dvery
tasty
and
right
on
spot
for
a
doppelbock
i
keep
liking
this
style
more
and
more
bc
it
is
so
smooth
with
great
earthy
malts
and
a
nice
level
of
sweetness
fantastic
rendition
of
the
style
smells
of
plums
chocolate
coffee
cocoa
you
name
it
not
much
lacing
down
the
glass
kinda
odd
for
a
doppelbock
in
the
fact
that
it
is
quite
smokey
i
like
that
however
and
it
is
quite
delicious
as
high
a
quality
americanmade
germanstyle
beer
you
will
find
very
creamy
and
smooth
way
too
drinkable
for
the
abv
kinda
scary
medium
bodied
and
pours
a
redish
black
color
very
nice
beer
glad
i
have
a
case
of
it
poured
into
a
pint
glass
i
got
no
head
when
i
poured
this
brew
just
a
thin
filmed
ring
that
slowly
disappeared
no
lacing
what
so
ever
very
strong
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
alcohol
clear
rich
mahogany
color
liquid
seems
to
cling
for
a
while
to
the
glass
small
carbonation
bubbles
and
the
slight
burn
of
alcohol
plays
on
the
tongue
sweet
and
malty
to
start
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
it
is
mighty
flavorful
1208
d
i
could
polish
off
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
easily
very
enjoyable
would
purchase
again
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
pint
glass
it
is
deep
caramel
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
bready
the
beeer
is
malt
forward
sweet
and
filling
full
bodied
and
filling
a
solid
offering
but
a
notch
below
others
of
the
style
amber
colored
beer
with
a
quickly
fading
head
aroma
is
mostly
caramel
with
subtle
fruits
taste
is
also
caramel
with
some
bread
and
fruit
overall
a
decent
beer
that
is
nothing
spectacular
but
something
that
you
would
probably
buy
more
than
just
once
2010
is
a
great
year
for
st
victorious
love
the
balance
and
nice
hop
finish
had
on
tap
at
victory
pours
a
nice
rich
amber
color
with
a
tan
head
the
taste
is
complex
with
a
clean
soft
finish
like
a
good
german
lager
the
smell
is
very
clean
best
version
of
st
v
in
a
long
time
might
be
too
drinkable
for
the
abv
damn
those
great
brewers
at
victory
pours
a
ruby
purply
brown
color
very
clear
minimal
head
and
lacing
somewhat
true
to
style
the
nose
is
rich
malt
yet
not
as
sweet
as
some
doppelbocks
taste
follows
scent
pretty
much
rich
bready
and
nutty
malts
but
not
as
rich
as
it
could
be
but
a
dark
berry
taste
lingers
in
the
the
background
nice
medium
body
on
this
decent
carbonation
level
after
the
lack
of
head
a
good
beer
with
some
nice
flavors
to
it
but
lacks
complexity
and
punch
i
get
from
other
beers
of
the
style
superenjoyable
very
much
on
the
desserty
side
of
things
chalk
st
victorious
up
as
another
victory
for
victory
i
have
a
feeling
this
six
pack
i
bought
is
very
old
ive
walked
past
this
numerous
times
in
the
aisle
all
in
about
a
year
i
dont
know
if
this
was
shaken
about
or
just
fizzed
out
still
it
did
impress
me
if
you
do
want
a
great
tasting
lager
excuse
me
doppelbock
this
is
a
malt
lovers
dream
good
stuff
but
certainly
not
the
brewerys
best
offering
dthe
beer
isnt
hot
but
it
doesnt
hide
its
alcohol
either
between
that
and
the
body
of
the
beer
it
would
be
hard
to
drink
many
of
these
but
one
was
perfect
for
tonight
amber
brown
color
smallish
head
smells
of
caramel
malty
goodness
similar
palate
plus
black
cherry
and
a
trace
of
spicy
hops
pleasant
levels
of
sweetness
and
carbonation
slightly
thinner
body
than
expected
surprisingly
refreshing
and
extremely
drinkable
d
i
could
throw
this
back
in
10
min
but
i
would
feel
it
right
away
you
dont
even
know
this
bad
boy
is
high
in
abv
pours
a
seethru
brownish
red
with
constant
tan
head
from
carbonation
and
slight
lace
patches
a
biscuity
and
roasted
malt
smell
along
with
caramel
and
possibly
butterscotch
or
something
like
that
with
very
minor
bitter
hops
dry
and
bready
are
the
first
things
that
come
to
my
mind
as
i
sip
this
mediumtofull
bodied
slightly
smooth
and
chewey
has
a
drying
effect
that
is
complemented
with
some
mild
sweet
caramel
and
bitter
chocolate
malt
as
well
as
the
hops
giving
off
some
slight
fruit
flavors
like
grape
sticky
on
the
sides
and
also
a
bit
of
toffee
tucked
into
the
sweetness
i
notice
as
i
drink
this
smooth
as
it
warms
abv
complements
beer
by
giving
it
that
strong
streak
wo
overpowering
beer
a
complex
brew
that
is
great
to
sip
on
im
still
gaining
my
malt
chops
and
this
is
definitely
a
step
in
the
right
direction
complex
but
approachable
flavor
d
a
rather
pleasant
beer
that
ive
gone
too
long
since
having
a
little
much
for
a
warm
spring
day
but
very
nice
on
a
cool
spring
night
a
food
note
dont
pair
with
grains
they
turn
the
beer
sour
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
imperial
pint
glass
appears
a
deep
chestnut
color
with
about
an
inch
of
lingering
ecru
foam
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
nose
is
filled
with
notes
of
sweet
malt
chocolate
and
fruits
such
as
plums
and
figs
tastes
of
bready
caramelized
maltsgrain
very
light
touch
of
smoke
and
coffee
mild
cocoa
powder
and
plums
tasty
stuff
just
about
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
some
warming
alcohol
take
your
time
with
this
one
and
enjoy
d
though
the
alcohol
is
masked
i
just
dont
think
this
is
that
quaffable
single
from
norms
vienna
va
best
by
dec
02
2009
i
havent
actually
seen
this
for
sale
in
ma
but
it
has
caused
me
to
try
other
dopplebocks
that
are
available
like
troegs
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
pick
it
up
you
wont
be
disappointed
d
a
highly
drinkable
dopplebock
which
is
widely
available
and
great
quality
as
everything
victory
produces
i
love
dopplebocks
and
this
is
another
fine
one
on
the
market
victory
ive
always
felt
does
solid
brews
a
few
really
fine
ones
and
some
solid
session
beers
but
nothing
bad
this
is
one
of
their
finer
outings
in
my
opinion
the
high
abv
8
50
is
masked
well
in
the
flavor
but
it
kicks
in
fairly
fast
letting
you
know
its
there
truly
enjoyable
this
is
another
great
example
from
victory
tiny
tan
head
on
initial
pour
that
vanished
almost
instantly
dark
purple
body
lets
a
little
light
in
lacing
doesnt
last
long
nose
has
lots
of
coffee
and
chocolate
in
it
wow
very
tasty
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
on
the
tongue
with
some
alcohol
heat
great
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
there
and
in
force
love
this
one
thanks
to
adam
pebkac
for
the
brew
drinkability
very
good
drinkability
but
this
is
a
beer
for
sipping
and
savoring
so
one
a
night
is
just
right
pours
a
very
dark
but
transparent
brown
obviously
not
bottle
conditioned
good
carbonation
with
an
offwhite
head
that
fades
quickly
smells
sweet
maybe
a
little
bready
or
something
along
those
lines
smell
is
also
a
little
smokey
perhaps
taste
is
superb
plenty
of
malts
plenty
of
substance
hints
of
smoke
some
fruitiness
and
a
well
balanced
spice
note
mouthfeel
is
thick
exactly
what
i
want
and
surpassing
my
expectations
for
the
style
very
impressed
with
this
offering
victory
does
a
great
set
of
brews
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
too
bad
they
refuse
to
distribute
it
here
medium
body
carbonation
on
the
lower
side
id
say
id
say
this
is
drinkable
but
i
personally
cant
drink
multiple
sweet
beers
in
a
row
so
when
i
finished
this
i
didnt
want
a
second
this
was
my
first
doppelbock
and
i
didnt
like
it
as
much
as
id
hoped
ill
try
it
again
if
i
can
my
first
doppelbock
and
it
didnt
disappoint
hopefully
i
can
get
a
hold
of
more
for
comparison
mouthfeel
less
carbonation
which
fits
this
style
of
beer
the
beer
rolls
of
the
tongue
wonderfully
overall
this
isnt
quite
worldclass
but
its
one
of
the
better
u
s
microbrewed
doppelbocks
ive
had
if
not
the
best
definitely
worth
a
shot
d
it
goes
down
fantastically
well
for
the
abv
id
have
no
problems
having
a
few
of
these
while
relaxing
with
a
book
or
any
other
stationary
activity
also
considering
the
style
id
say
10
is
definitely
a
good
price
for
a
six
pack
especially
here
in
pa
d
definitely
a
good
beer
to
try
8
5
abv
but
a
really
nice
dessert
beer
a
very
complex
beer
it
reminded
me
of
a
samilclaus
but
i
actually
preferred
this
over
samiclaus
drinkability
a
real
winner
of
a
brew
imo
and
one
of
victorys
finest
the
alcohols
up
there
but
its
well
masked
and
made
up
for
by
a
fine
assortment
of
flavors
and
an
absolutely
fantastic
mouthfeel
i
might
be
picking
up
a
sixer
of
this
next
winter
seems
like
an
excellent
malty
go
to
winter
brew
md
easy
drinking
light
bodied
beer
for
me
though
not
one
that
i
would
reach
to
time
after
time
the
spices
in
it
keep
me
from
enjoying
more
than
one
d
a
great
american
doppelbock
from
victory
loved
this
one
d
warming
and
filling
great
for
the
cold
winter
months
very
strong
but
also
very
welcome
solid
brew
from
victory
here
very
smooth
feel
that
glides
along
the
tongue
with
understated
carbonation
the
taste
is
full
and
malty
the
sweetness
held
in
check
by
a
barely
noticeable
level
of
hops
bready
flavors
come
through
in
full
force
with
a
nutty
undercurrent
delicious
even
if
it
doesnt
reach
the
height
of
complexity
found
in
the
best
from
germany
i
could
have
several
of
these
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
and
appropriate
level
of
co2
prickliness
tasty
with
the
wellhidden
abv
i
could
definitely
see
myself
drinking
this
a
bit
faster
than
it
should
be
consumed
overall
mmm
a
good
one
from
victory
but
not
my
favorite
one
this
poured
a
clear
dark
mahogany
with
tan
head
it
smelled
like
fresh
barley
and
wheat
with
light
lemon
and
copper
hops
it
tasted
like
lots
of
copper
hops
and
roasted
barley
with
some
lemon
hops
and
bready
yeast
it
was
somewhat
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
very
much
like
an
oktoberfest
but
stronger
it
hid
the
alcohol
well
and
had
decent
body
the
flavor
was
good
but
wasnt
as
sweet
or
complex
as
i
was
hoping
perhaps
a
couple
years
of
age
might
help
that
if
so
this
could
become
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
consider
this
beer
a
great
winter
treat
i
may
purchase
again
would
like
to
see
it
in
a
victory
variety
pack
d
despite
it
being
boring
to
me
it
has
above
average
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
not
the
limiting
factor
its
the
feeling
of
rising
blood
sugar
level
very
nice
full
flavored
and
chewey
yet
still
smooth
on
the
palette
this
is
a
well
done
doppelbock
from
victory
i
havent
visited
this
since
having
it
in
the
bottle
a
couple
of
years
ago
so
this
was
a
nice
catchup
on
a
good
beer
pours
a
very
dark
amber
chestnut
brown
color
with
thin
tan
head
hthat
settles
into
thin
lace
nice
roasted
chocolate
malty
aroma
roasted
malty
flavor
that
lasts
throughout
with
hints
of
chocolate
caramel
chestnut
and
licorice
very
wellbalanced
and
quaffable
with
a
bitter
sweet
dry
hoppy
finish
i
like
that
theyve
stuck
true
to
style
and
havent
skimped
on
one
ounce
of
what
makes
dopplebocks
so
delicious
the
malts
victory
certainly
are
victorious
here
i
could
guzzle
this
down
pint
after
pint
and
fortunately
or
unfortunately
there
seems
to
be
no
sign
of
the
8
5
here
to
stop
me
drinkablity
world
class
really
enjoyed
the
balanced
approach
to
the
style
hv
pours
clouded
brown
with
a
creme
head
thickly
sweet
malts
are
present
but
the
strong
sweet
flavor
is
what
dominates
kind
of
onedimensional
to
me
feel
is
decent
on
the
body
carbonation
has
a
bit
of
a
bite
overall
it
seems
a
bit
too
cloying
really
its
okay
at
best
i
guess
d
pretty
solid
despite
the
abv
goes
down
fairly
smoothly
could
drink
several
md
the
sweetness
lingers
in
your
mouth
the
carbonation
is
low
and
the
alcohol
presence
is
low
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
a
great
doppelbock
d
i
could
and
have
drank
3
or
so
of
these
in
a
sitting
eventually
the
abv
catches
up
with
you
and
your
palate
gets
fatigued
by
a
sweetness
that
tends
to
compound
over
time
but
for
a
winter
beer
thats
meant
to
be
enjoyed
on
a
cold
snowy
night
this
one
is
hard
to
beat
ive
held
6
aside
to
enjoy
next
winter
so
well
see
how
these
fare
with
age
m
d
quite
a
lovely
character
full
bodied
rich
not
quite
silky
a
little
on
the
heavy
andor
slightly
sticky
side
for
that
but
trying
for
it
a
nicer
feel
for
the
style
and
quite
nicely
done
all
around
this
is
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
by
victory
and
i
look
forward
to
the
other
4
bottles
in
this
6pack
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
hazed
deep
russet
color
with
a
tight
12
finger
slight
off
white
head
that
decent
lasting
power
aromas
of
dark
fruit
ala
raisin
and
prune
along
with
some
sweet
caramel
mainlyflavors
were
alot
like
the
aromas
heavy
handed
raisin
and
brown
sugar
with
some
caramel
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
a
doughy
element
a
solid
doppelbock
very
flavorful
it
is
pretty
big
and
warming
drinkability
good
drinkability
a
tad
on
the
heavy
side
to
be
a
session
beer
but
it
is
a
nice
rich
flavorful
and
malty
doppelbock
well
worth
trying
esepcially
for
an
american
version
of
this
style
clear
and
copper
in
color
with
a
slight
beige
head
sweet
and
smoky
in
smell
also
a
slight
odor
of
lemon
or
tartness
very
mellow
in
taste
a
bit
of
the
smokiness
but
not
overpowering
a
good
beer
not
a
favorite
style
decent
drinkability
would
like
to
try
again
to
form
more
of
an
opinion
overall
not
a
bad
brew
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
this
one
has
a
solid
malt
character
both
in
nose
and
taste
being
a
hop
guy
i
can
probably
not
appreciate
this
as
much
as
many
that
being
said
its
a
pretty
good
beer
rather
good
for
a
doppelbock
drinkability
an
easy
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
and
will
definitely
warm
the
spirit
tonight
flavors
are
sweet
to
begin
with
caramel
and
toffee
notes
next
are
some
stronger
nutty
flavors
that
end
a
little
bitter
just
a
hint
of
some
bittering
hops
are
noticeable
the
alcohol
warmth
becomes
noticeable
after
a
few
sips
this
beer
definitely
leans
more
to
the
sweeter
side
towards
the
end
i
was
ready
for
something
less
sweet
but
this
did
not
take
away
from
it
being
a
great
beer
overall
victory
hit
this
style
right
on
pours
an
reddish
amber
color
which
looked
a
little
bit
light
to
me
for
a
doppelbock
smell
was
of
biscuity
malt
with
not
a
lot
of
hops
coming
through
taste
had
a
biscuity
malt
flavor
but
it
was
relatively
dry
and
not
overly
sweet
there
was
a
distinct
tanginessspiciness
to
the
beer
that
seems
to
come
out
in
some
dopplebocks
that
kept
the
beer
from
being
too
sweet
not
a
lot
of
hops
come
through
in
the
taste
a
good
beer
that
is
worth
trying
if
you
come
across
it
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
this
is
a
great
version
of
an
american
dopplebock
victory
once
again
shows
of
their
mastery
of
german
malts
md
thick
body
and
strong
carbonation
d
the
balance
makes
this
much
more
drinkable
than
some
versions
of
the
style
that
can
be
overly
sweet
at
7
6
the
abv
is
not
too
high
to
keep
me
from
having
a
few
especially
here
at
home
st
victorious
pours
a
deep
red
brown
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
the
freshness
dat
reads
enjoy

the
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
with
plenty
of
dark
raisin
fruitiness
the
flavor
is
rich
and
malty
not
quite
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
there
is
more
of
a
toasted
character
nice
and
crisp
the
alcohol
is
almost
unnoticeable
especially
considering
the
strength
drinkability
it
was
nothing
short
of
a
great
hoopy
american
doppelbock
iwouldnt
have
thought
that
a
hoppy
doppelbock
would
be
this
good
but
victory
sure
changed
my
mind
about
that
subject
would
i
buy
this
one
again
i
would
at
a
drop
of
a
hat
deep
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
aroma
heavy
on
carmel
and
toffee
notes
smells
almost
like
perfection
but
just
a
little
boozy
tatse
is
more
dark
carmel
and
toffee
flavors
with
just
a
touch
of
dark
chocolate
really
no
roastiness
just
creamy
malt
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
to
wrap
things
together
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
pleasing
for
a
coldweather
beer
drinkability
is
good
but
the
alcohol
detracts
from
the
experience
just
a
bit
if
it
were
a
bit
better
disguised
or
if
i
aged
the
beers
a
bit
more
it
would
be
exquisite
pours
a
hazy
orange
brown
nice
thick
off
white
head
forms
drops
slowly
leaving
tons
of
lace
great
retention
a
very
nice
looking
beer
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
lots
of
toffee
iron
bread
yeast
some
spices
and
dark

very

very

nice

good
flavour
solidly
balanced
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
not
world
class
but
a
nicely
done
doppelbock
thanks
jay
heavy
and
earthy
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slick
mouthfeel
the
finish
is
full
but
crisp
with
a
buttery
lingering
texture
the
flavors
and
textures
are
all
over
the
place
but
they
still
manage
to
tie
together
seamlessly
so
complex
probably
the
best
doppelbock
ive
ever
had
really
an
amazing
beer
the
taste
does
not
quite
live
up
to
the
rich
promise
of
the
aroma
but
it
certainly
gives
it
a
go
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
that
is
fitting
my
current
mood
needs
just
right
d
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
dopplebocks
yet
but
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
many
of
an
excellent
example
of
a
doppelbock
another
typically
excellent
beer
from
victory
drinkability
is
great
excellent
balance
great
malty
base
really
nice
doppel
d
hmm
not
exactly
what
comes
to
mind
when
i
think
of
a
dobbelbock
almost
tastes
more
like
a
scotch
ale
at
times
nevertheless
it
is
pretty
drinkable
considering
the
high
abv
and
slight
alcoholic
taste
enjoy
on
a
cold
winter
night
with
some
hearty
sausage
or
chili
fit
the
style
well
but
apparently
just
not
really
my
style
i
wouldnt
decline
an
offer
for
this
one
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
d
awesome
very
tasty
i
bought
a
single
next
time
a
sixer
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
low
carbonation
giving
this
a
nice
smooth
creamy
feel
and
the
drinkability
is
really
good
if
not
for
the
high
abv
i
would
be
able
to
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
this
would
be
a
good
dbock
if
the
smell
could
be
rectified
man
this
is
a
very
complex
doppelbock
and
all
the
different
flavours
are
working
very
well
together

eh
i
know
the
style
can
get
up
there
but
its
very
well
hidden
here
once
again
kudos
to
wasatch
for
sending
this
one
its
a
winner
for
sure
reddish
brown
with

substantial

a

malty

and
dark

beers

great
representation

pours
clear
dark
red
amber
with
thin
light
tan
bubbly
head
and
lots
of
small
bubbles
moving
up
through
the
body
the
smell
is
complex
malt
with
light
bread
and
slightly
nutty
aroma
the
initial
flavor
is
moderate
sweet
malt
nicely
balanced
with
hop
bitterness
that
finishes
a
little
acidic
and
moderately
bitter
with
a
little
salty
right
at
the
end
nice
complex
malt
layering
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
fullbodied
with
slightly
oily

and
lively
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
beer
for
cool
evenings
or
an
airconditioned
summer
day
the
complex
flavor
is
interesting
and
wellbalanced
and
i
would
definitely
purchase
again
pours
amber

some

a
little
smokiness
in

as
well
as
some
grassiness
somewhat
peaty
smokiness
in
the
taste
both
up

and
in
the
finish
a
flash
of
the
sweet
sugary
malts
in
the
middle
followed
by
a
decent
sized
grassy
bitterness
before
moving
to
the
somewhat
smoky
finish
light
to
medium
in
body
mouthfeel
is
not
overly
heavy
and
the
beer
is
not
overly
rich
a
little
stronger
on
the
hops
side
than
i
expected
from
a
doppel
wit
a
decently
dry
and
somewhat
spicy
finish
but
this
keeps
it
refreshing
and
the
light
to
medium
body
makes
it
highly
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
barely
evident
very
drinkable
beer
d
i
think
this
may
be
the
best
doppelbock
i
have
had
it
just
feels
like
the
perfect
balance
between
sweetness
yet
still
enough
hops
and
the
fruit
flavor
just
a
great
beer
a
well
balanced
full
flavored
doppelbock
tremendous
flavor
profile
one
of
the
best
american
doppelbocks
ive
had
to
date
pretty
sweet
and
rich
drink
perfect
for
winter
easy
to
drink
flavor
is
actually
fairly
simple
heavy
on
the
malts
nice
roasted
character
to
it
some
toffee
too
picking
out
some
fruits
particularly
overripe
cherries
a
rather
nice
burn
from
the
alcohol
too
pleasant
and
soothing
actually
heavy
and
full
mouthfeel
it
would
coat
the
cheeks
but
the
alcohol
evaporates
nciely
and
thins
it
out
solid
beer
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
i
will
definitely
have
to
seek
it
out
next
winter
it
is
smooth
and
delicious
unbelievably
so
considering
the
8
5
abv
this
beer
gives
me
something
of
a
warm
feeling
i
can
picture
drinking
it
by
a
fire
on
a
cold
winters
night
d
this
is
a
good
beer
and
quite
drinkable
however
i
believe
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
this
is
a
great
dopplebock
there
are
many
flavors
in
this
and
its
not
as
thick
as
other
dbs
ive
tried
which
is
good
because
id
love
to
have
another
watch
out
though
at
8
5
abv
it
could
catch
up
to
yah
if
youre
driving
deep
brown
in
color
with
a
slight
head
somewhat
hazy
low
aromasomewhat
metallic
and
sharp
malty
enough
flavor
but
has
a
real
homebrew
like
wang
to
it
somewhat
nutty
taste
ok
body
overall
i
am
not
very
impressed
i
prefer
the
hellesmaibock
from
victory
rather
average
for
me
to
be
honest
a
solid
brew
that
is
too
easy
to
drink
at
8
5
this
could
be
really
dangerous
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
a
while
id
pick
this
up
and
drink
it
often
if
it
was
around
scott
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
i
gave
it
a
solid
four
because
it
is
no
doubt
a
nice
brew
but
i
think
it
lacks
complexity
and
would
expect
a
bit
more
from
a
doppelbock

victory

complex
fairly
sweet
but
not
cloying
as
theres
just
enough
hops
to
cancel
some
of
it
out
on
the
finish
it
has
a
mediumfull
body
creamy
texture
and
soft

another
very
good
beer
from

thats
definitely
worth
trying
this
was
a
nice
treat
in
the
way
of
doppelbocks
its
a
few
notches
above
average
the
pour
was
very
nice
indeed
looking
like
something
youd
see
in
an
ad
a
lovely
red
bronze
colour
with
a
voluminous
sticky
sand
coloured
head
that
remained
for
several
minutes
this
looked
great
smell
fairly
average
for
the
style
with
some
caramelised
sugar
very
faint
dark
fruit
hiding
way
in
the
back
some
toasted
grain
your
average
doppelbock
taste
was
nice
and
flavourful
without
being
too
strong
very
enjoyable
and
almost
thirst
quenching

frank4sailmar

not
my
favorite
style
to
begin
with
but
a
nice
departure
from
sam
adams
usual
offerings
nice
medium
body
not
too
strong
of
a
nose
but
decently
bready
and
malty
heavy
on
the
toffee
brown
sugar
cherries
malt
while
its
fairly
sticky
and
syrupy
in
the
mouth
the
finish
leaves
something
to
be
desired
maybe
a
little
nutty
and
boozy
at
the
end
but
nothing
that
was
begging
me
to
keep
drinking
it
overall
a
nice
addition
to
the
sam
adams
collection
but
just
not
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
if
its
at
your
local
bottle
shop
its
worth
a
shot
as
its
pretty
affordable
and
may
be
a
nice
choice
if
youre
into
it
not
much
smell
but
better
than
any
other
bock
ive
had
so
far
very
red
beer
cheers
carbonation
seems
slightly
above
what
i
would
expect
as
well
amber
pour
with
thin
tan
head
doesnt
look
as
appealing
as
its
about
to
be
aromas
of
bread
and
caramel
much
the
same
comes
across
the
tongue
a
sweet
finish
makes
this
just
right
overall
not
a
bad
go
at
a
doppelbock
from
a
us
brewer
it
stays
solidly
in
the
malt
flavor
wheelhouse
and
comes
decently
close
on
mouthfeel
its
not
my
favorite
doppelbock
nor
even
my
favorite
us
attempt
but
its
a
solid
beer
not
the
best
dopplebock
but
a
nice
draft
this
one
has
quite
the
shoes
to
fill
following
a
glass
of
the
legendary
bavarian
benchmark
celebrator
dopplebock
poured
from
the
22
oz
bomber
into
a
nonic
pint
glass
with
perhaps
a
little
too
much
oomph
after
a
brief
cascade
of
foam
over
the
side
it
settles
in
to
a
towering
frothy
creamcolored
head
the
interesting
color
of
the
brew
only
accentuates
the
appearance
ruby
red
under
the
lamp
with
amber
highlights
a
transparent
mahogany
in
the
shadows
in
time
the
pronounced
foam
settles
in
to
a
patchy
coating
with
consistent
lacing
all
the
way
up
to
the
rim
the
aroma
epitomizes
that
massive
malt
dopplebock
bouquet
bread
dough
with
some
faint
molasses
soy
sauce
and
figlike
esters
a
touch
of
earthy
minerals
in
the
nose
the
first
sip
brings
a
potent
malt
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
a
metallic
twang
boozy
brown
sugar
flavors
coat
the
tongue
and
finish
with
a
slightly
drying
bitterness
a
little
toffee
is
present
but
this
is
not
particularly
complex
not
as
earthy
as
i
expected
either
mostly
theres
rock
candy
sweetness
and
enormous
malt
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
hearty
a
bit
sticky
full
bodied
the
carbonation
is
such
that
it
helps
provide
a
creamy
texture
given
the
high
gravity
of
this
one
its
no
surprise
that
a
noticeable
alcohol
warmth
is
present
in
the
chest
maybe
a
tad
cloying
and
a
little
stronger
than
i
prefer
for
the
style
perhaps
its
lacking
some
of
the
character
of
its
bavarian
brethren
but
its
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
a
worthy
beer
to
pay
tribute
to
its
predecessors
and
a
solid
nod
to
sam
for
crafting
another
outstanding
offering
on
tap
at
the
sam
adams
brewhouse
in
breinigsville
pa
very
smooth
and
flavorful
one
of
the
few
sam
adams
products
that
i
really
enjoyed
was
better
before
they
switched
to
4
packs
thick
and
chewy
mmm
i
liked
it
a
lot
sweet
and
complex
deep
brown
with
a
smallish
quickly
dissipating
off
white
head
huge
bready
caramel
raisin
dried
fruity
maltiness
with
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
earthy
hop
to
balance
nice
sipper
that
i
need
to
spend
a
little
more
time
getting
to
know
overall
a
very
good
double
bock
but
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
the
malt
bomb
you
would
expect
in
this
style
from
this
brewer
but
a
well
done
take
on
the
style
bigger
than
most
authentically
german
and
memorably
different
at
the
same
time
its
so
dense
in
grain
toffee
and
burning
sugar
in
a
fry
pan
with
a
lager
yeast
that
cant
eat
the
sweet
there
is
a
european
nature
to
the
malt
and
a
strong
alcohol
presence
in
there
two
i
like
its
weight
its
great
for
the
fall
but
its
a
beer
that
i
just
cant
drink
real
much
of
because
of
how
big
it
is
with
all
its
sticky
sweetness
seems
to
me
like
an
awesome
cooking
beer
cheesy
beer
muffins
bread
pudding
even
a
pot
of
chili
would
benefit
from
a
brew
like
this
i
appreciate
it
but
i
dont
love
it
cool
that
a
brewery
this
big
still
does
stuff
like
this
though
this
is
definitely
not
rookie
beer
o
quite
possibly
my
favorite
sa
beer
its
a
massive
malt
bomb
that
shines
with
caramel
and
dark
fruit
notes
a
fine
example
of
the
style
overall
a
big
and
robust
thick
and
fruity
sweet
double
bock
if
looking
for
something
very
sweet
and
malty
then
this
is
a
good
choice
with
it
delivering
in
both
sweet
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
roast
balancing
it
all
out
overall
fairly
tasty
this
is
one
outstanding
beer
looks
great
and
tastes
even
better
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
showed
me
a
beautiful
dark
reddish
brown
pour
with
a
2
finger
fluffy
tan
head
which
left
nice
lace
as
i
sipped
it
down
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
hints
of
bread
and
brown
sugar
along
with
dark
fruits
with
the
first
taste
i
was
happy
i
found
another
well
made
special
beer
by
samuel
adams
they
have
many
and
im
not
a
beer
snob
so
its
a
winner
the
medium
mouthfeel
sets
up
the
malty
sweet
flow
over
the
tongue
roasted
malt
and
a
rich
bread
round
out
the
solid
but
fruity
taste
that
hides
the
abv
well
and
a
hint
of
carmel
picks
out
at
the
end
a
very
solid
double
bock
appearance
was
dark
brown
with
a
egg
shell
white
head
the
smell
was
very
sweet
with
a
lot
of
malt
characteristics
and
almost
a
vanilla
or
caramel
the
taste
was
heavy
and
a
little
boozy
but
after
that
i
got
a
lot
of
semi
sweet
flavor
dominated
by
malt
and
heavy
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
but
satisfying
overall
very
nice
but
maybe
not
for
everyday
this
beer
was
a
good
beer
i
liked
that
it
was
a
bock
beer
i
liked
the
malt
body
this
beer
i
liked
that
it
was
dark
i
also
liked
the
fruit
taste
that
it
has
i
liked
that
it
was
sweet
i
could
taste
the
raisin
fig
that
it
has
in
its
flavor
i
would
not
mind
having
this
beer
again
if
i
could
find
it
somewhere
where
i
live
deep
garnet
in
color
with
a
slightly
viscous
appearance
poured
with
a
short
light
beige
foam
that
quickly
dissipated
leaving
random
wisps
sweet
dark
candied
fruit
and
toasted
caramel
malt
aromas
with
toffee
herbal
hop
and
boozy
notes
full

with
a
thick
oily
feel
with
subdued
lightly
crispy
carbonation
from
the
middle
to
the
end
big
toasted
and
caramel
malt
flavors
up

followed

crisp
herbal

flavors
through

with

with

and
finished
crisp
and
hoppy
finished
with
a
light
crispness
with

herbal
hops
and
a
sneaky
booziness
a
solid
beer
from
boston
beer
co
indulge
in
this
one
slowly
as
it
is
thick
and
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
the
abv
were
to
sneak
up
on
some
beware
of
cavities
as
this
is
one
sweet
beer
but
dont
let
that
stop
you
from
grabbing
a
bottle
its
worth
it
o
some
definite
flaws
here
slightly
too
thick
and
too
boozy
to
be
considered
a
great
brew
and
not
a
match
for
most
european
versions
not
a
repeat
buy
as
better
dopples
are
easily
obtained
almost
anywhere
nice
melanoidin
character
not
cloyingly
sweet
but
a
bit
hot
overall
a
big
and
wonderful
beer
very
sweet
but
not
overly
a
great
beer
to
introduce
people
to
a
style
thats
not
so
well
done
in
the
states
big
bold
flavors
make
me
want
to
go
for
utopias
i
imagine
it
being
a
bigger
bolder
but
somewhat
related
to
this
one
samuel
adams
has
done
this
up
right
with
rich
and
broad
flavors
o
active
appearance
bready
and
yeasty
perfect
mouthfeel
i
tend
to
favor
domestic
doppelbocks
over
bavarian
because
of
the
mouthfeel
and
i
think
i
have
to
rate
sam
adams
over
troegenator
simply
awesome
o
outstanding
for
the
style
a

nice
balance
complexity
and
robustness
of
malt
and
yeast
ester
flavors
with
a
great
maltfruitiness
balance
and
zero
cloying
sweetness
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
moderately
creamy
and
slick
mouthfeel
that
is
great
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
minimal
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
excellent
doppelbock
all
around
great
complexity
balance
and
robustness
of
malt
and
yeast
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
for
the
abv
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
a
nice
stab
at
the
style
from
sam
adams
while
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
overall
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
and
might
even
pick
it
up
again
sometime
12
for
a
4
pack
brings
this
beer
into
a
category
that
it
is
not
yet
ready
to
tackle
with
this
offering
a
little
too
much
raisens
and
or
dried
plums
and
brown
sugar
for
my
taste
but
by
its
style
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
very
good
american
doppelbock
worth
a
try
o
kind
of
a
sparse
review
but
there
isnt
much
i
could
say
about
this
beer
average
or
below
not
sure
of
the
age
on
this
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
a
very
good
beer
hadnt
had
this
beer
since
i
was
probably
1920
so
i
couldnt
appreciate
it
as
much
as
i
do
now
a
delicious
dopplebock
w
tremendous
flavor
a
good
punch
and
wonderful
aftertaste
and
drinkability
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
dark
hue
slight
head
slight
lacing
nose
is
roasted
and
sweet
nutty
and
sweet
hearty
roasted
malt
with
a
little
spice
and
bitterness
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
overall
not
to
bad
not
great
but
pretty
descent
certainly
worth
a
try
overall
i
really
like
the
beer
however
i
think
it
is
a
bit
hoppy
compared
to
other
bocks
that
i
have
had
however
it
is
still
a
good
bock
with
fairly
good
caramel
malt
flavor
ive
always
enjoyed
this
beer
and
think
it
does
justice
to
the
style
its
been
consistent
and
tasty
throughout
the
years
and
this
sample
was
no
exception
besides
all
the
boozy
caramellike
features
there
is
also
an
enjoyable
roasted
malt
component
very
flavorful
and
robust
wonderfully
balanced
with
a
nuanced
complexity
mealinaglass
yes
indeed
id
personally
rather
drink
this
very
cold
in
a
bigger
bottle
so
i
can
do
one
and
be
done
with
it
and
i
understand
it
might
be
coming
out
that
way
oh
and
a
little
age
up
to
68
months
helps
this
one
from
past
experience
celebrator
and
korbinian
are
still
my
favorite
doppelbocks
initially
i
was
not
over
the
moon
with
this
brew
but
as
i
slow
sipped
it
it
got
better
and
better
while
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
i
would
buy
it
again
it
obviously
fits
the
style
well
but
lacks
a
bit
of
the
bitterness
that
i
like
in
other
representations
of
this
style
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
modest
head
developed
with
mild
retention
and
little
lacing
appearance
was
a
reddish
brown
with
a
hazy
hue
aroma
had
hints
of
caramel
and
fruit
taste
was
of
caramel
toffee
and
fruit
with
hints
of
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
mild
slightly
creamy
aftertaste
was
dry
with
a
boozy
finish
its
good
not
great
nice
but
crazy
big
for
the
style
to
a
novice
id
think
this
is
almost
undrinkable
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
definitely
lighter
in
color
though
that
matters
little
to
me
more
bitter
than
i
expected
too
and
that
also
through
it
just
a
bit
off
balance
but
still
really
good
overall
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
too
sweet
probably
wouldnt
try
again
but
if
you
like
sweet
beers
you
might
like
this
one
overall
this
an
excellent
example
of
the
doppelbock
style
a
lot
of
breweries
are
only
producing
doppelbocks
as
a
seasonal
or
limited
edition
beer
which
is
unfortunate
i
have
added
this
to
my
buy
it
when
i
see
it
list
o
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
enough
double
bock
it
has
a
pleasing
balance
of
different
types
of
malt
sweetness
and
hops
bitterness
but
it
is
really
not
anything
outstanding
it
is
neither
a
great
representation
of
the
style
or
an
interesting
variation
on
the
style
still
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
also
this
beer
has
aged
about
one
year
by
now
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
and
the
flavors
have
had
time
to
blend
together
a
year
ago
the
first
bottle
in
this
fourpack
had
a
flamethrowing
amount
of
alcohol
heat
that
overwhelmed
all
of
the
other
flavors
except
for
the
sharp
hops
bitterness
this
beer
becomes
a
much
better
drinking
experience
with
aging
but
i
am
just
not
sure
that
it
is
worth
the
wait
this
gets
some
bonus
points
for
not
being
reminiscent
of
samuel
adams
triple
bock
which
still
gives
me
nightmares
otherwise
its
an
average
dopplebock
lots
of
caramel
but
too
much
booze
pass
every
once
in
a
while
you
gotta
have
this
troegenator
or
a
korbinian
which
i
havent
seen
around
in
a
while
throw
in
samichlaus
at
christmas
going
to
lagertown
d
not
bad
more
than
one
would
be
a
chore
but
it
is
a
nice
experience
id
have
again
popped
the
cap
off
and
smelled
the
beer
smells
like
chocolate
but
with
a
hint
of
barn
funk
gosh
i
am
hoping
the
barn
funk
doesnt
continue
to
the
taste
poured
into
a
pewter
stein
took
one
sip
wow
i
cant
believe
a
beer
as
complex
as
this
comes
from
sam
adams
i
like
several
sam
adams
beers
but
they
usually
are
tastystraightforward
and
not
complex
i
taste
at
least
4
different
levels
to
this
beer
first
off
there
is
the
sweet
chocolatey
malts
and
man
are
they
sweet
next
i
hint
just
a
tinge
of
dark
fruit
like
the
rochefort
quadrupel
i
tried
last
week
then
more
sweet
malts
with
less
chocolate
and
more
caramel
finishes
sweet
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
incredible
not
the
thickest
i
have
had
but
excellent
overall
it
is
as
close
to
chocolate
milk
as
i
can
describe
for
a
beer
without
it
being
gross
excellent
only
thing
i
would
probably
wish
for
is
a
little
more
of
a
head
on
the
pour
one
of
my
new
favorites
although
i
must
admit
i
am
partial
to
the
style
this
is
a
bottle
i
have
been
sitting
for
maybe
3
years
now
so
well
see
how
it
is
with
that
in
mind
it
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
just
a
slight
beige
head
as
the
bottle
indicates
this
is
very
malty
and
gives
off
a
sweet
grain
scent
the
taste
is
kind
of
has
a
barrel
aged
chocolate
thing
going
on
overall
it
is
very
sweet
and
drinkable
definitely
taste
a
little
of
the
bitterness
from
the
9
5
abv
but
it
is
very
subtle
very
interesting
next
time
i
would
probably
just
drink
this
new
instead
of
aging
it
by
accident
though
overall
a
solid
beer
and
probably
among
my
favorites
of
those
from
bbc
im
not
sure
of
this
ones
age
but
i
think
it
has
reaped
some
benefit
from
being
in
the
bottle
for
a
bit
o
very
good
doppelbock
reminds
me
alot
of
troegenator
actually
o
i
feel
like
it
could
have
a
little
bit
more
in
the
way
of
drinkability
but
it
still
does
a
good
job
of
ticking
all
the
doppelbock
requirements
with
aplomb
a
damn
good
brew
in
general
one
of
sas
finest
regular
offerings
overall
this
is
farily
decently
made
respectable
doppelbock
that
can
easily
be
found
for
a
decent
price
cant
hold
a
candle
to
many
of
the
traditional
german
examples
but
its
passable
compared
to
many
poorly
made
overly
sweet
american
examples
i
like
malty
sticky
brews
but
this
one
is
a
little
too
sweet
and
candy
flavored
from
the
12
oz
bottle
a
single
from
best
damn
soon
to
be
krisp
in
san
diego
its
not
celebrator
but
id
probably
take
it
over
a
salvator
im
a
big
doppelbock
fan
and
this
one
is
worth
having
review
from
92010
notes
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
dark
orange
amber
with
very
light
carbonation
very
little
head
but
a
hint
of
lacing
aroma
of
mild
caramel
malt
flavor
is
heavy
sweet
malt
with
caramel
with
a
malty
slightly
hopped
finish
nice
medium
body
somewhat
boozy
aftertaste
seems
like
a
well
made
beer
but
not
that
complex
pours
a
dark
hazelnut
with
a
very
thin
inch
cream
colored
head
the
head
dissipates
very
quickly
with
little
if
any
lacing
this
beer
is
a
mouthful
very
literally
liquid
bread
with
some
raisins
figs
possibly
some
cinnamon
in
that
bread
as
well
the
malts
are
right
out
front
and
big
finishes
pretty
cleanly
with
a
crisp
light
hop
tone
probably
saaz
like
most
reviewers
on
this
site
im
not
much
of
a
sam
adams
guy
but
this
looked
too
interesting
to
pass
on
and
im
glad
i
didnt
this
is
a
rock
solid
high
gravity
dopplebock
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
from
samuel
adams
buy
it
now
overall
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
barley
wine
taste
wise
its
very
well
done
and
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
this
brewer
id
like
to
keep
a
few
tucked
away
to
see
how
the
flavours
develop
over
time
o
this
beer
is
like
having
liquid
brown
bread
along
with
some
additional
flavors
and
is
rather
easy
to
drink
considering
its
strength
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
o
the
only
other
doppelbocks
ive
ever
had
samiclaus
bier
and
kuhnhenns
dark
heathen
were
nothing
like
this
they
were
very
thin
on
the
palate
and
more
silky
sweet
this
has
a
chunky
malty
weight
to
it
im
not
sure
which
is
more
appropos
of
the
style
but
the
other
two
were
much
easier
to
drink
this
was
like
drinking
a
protein
shake
not
a
horrible
beer
but
a
bit
much
for
my
tastes
o
the
saving
grace
of
sam
adams
their
imperial
series
this
is
an
incredible
doppelbock
any
american
brewer
that
can
do
a
traditional
german
lager
with
this
amount
of
richness
and
complexity
should
be
applauded
well
done
bbc
o
nice
doppelbock
nice
mix
of
sweet
and
dry
malts
o
a
good
beer
but
not
sure
ill
be
actively
seeking
out
a
second
goround
1st
brew
tried
from
imperial
series
pours
a
ruddy
brown
with
decent
amount
of
carbonation
the
head
is
tan
but
not
very
tall
it
recedes
to
a
ring
and
a
few
small
splotches
the
smell
is
of
maple
and
caramel
with
a
touch
of
fruit
maybe
like
strawberry
and
orange
the
taste
follows
the
smell
well
strong
maple
and
caramel
very
sweet
and
smooth
i
detect
a
slight
alcohol
taste
mouthfeel
is
thickish
overall
a
decent
beer
i
quite
like
it
as
an
american
double
bock
pours
a
hazy
redamber
color
with
a
large
full
head
the
aroma
is
big
on
malts
with
some
fruits
backing
it
up
the
taste
is
very
large
and
alcoholic
with
fruits
being
the
primary
flavor
honestly
its
a
little
too
much
for
me
and
winds
up
tasting
just
a
bit
too
hot
in
general
it
doesnt
taste
bad
on
the
way
down
but
its
really
just
too
much
fruitiness
with
too
much
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
far
too
smooth
to
really
be
of
note
and
the
drinkability
is
not
very
good
overall
this
is
a
beer
thats
just
too
big
for
its
own
good
the
fruit
dominance
just
doesnt
work
with
the
huge
alcoholic
flavors
that
this
beer
presents
im
usually
a
big
sam
adams
fan
but
this
tastes
a
little
too
much
like
hot
vomit
for
my
tastes
ive
been
hearing
this
is
one
of
sams
best
for
a
long
time
and
its
not
not
even
close
poured
a
meager
trace
of
a
head
which
almost
immediately
vanished
the
body
looks
like
iced
tea
in
masstone
but
held
to
the
light
its
more
of
an
auburn
i
expected
quite
a
malty
smell
but
to
be
honest
it
had
very
little
until
it
had
sat
out
for
quite
a
long
time
like
a
wine
that
had
to
open
up
taste
has
the
malt
but
ive
had
maltier
and
more
complex
its
also
a
little
on
the
yeasty
side
overall
a
pretty
solid
american
take
on
a
doppelbock
not
as
dark
and
roasty
as
one
might
expect
but
the
fruit
flavors
here
are
good
rjt
pours
a
nice
mahogany
color
with
a
beige
head
that
fades
quickly
to
nominal
lacing
pleasant
aroma
of
malt
with
caramel
nuts
dark
fruits
and
a
hint
of
spice
mild
taste
of
caramel
sweetness
mixed
in
with
dark
fruit
and
a
bit
of
nut
very
subtle
bitterness
and
a
dry
finish
medium
body
smooth
with
a
velvety
texture
as
it
warms
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
enhanced
has
a
nice
warming
feeling
very
enjoyable
a
good
sipper
to
enjoy
on
a
winter
evening
o
pretty
good
and
easy
drinking
not
the
best
doppelbock
ive
had
but
holds
its
own
in
the
style
i
like
the
thick
mouthfeel
i
missed
that
recently
in
a
spaten
optimator
this
is
one
of
the
best
sam
adams
beers
ive
had
contrasted
against
a
lot
of
safe
transitional
beers
they
put
out
kinda
pricey
not
on
an
abv
per
ounce
basis
just
on
a
per
ounce
basis
im
not
drinking
to
get
drunk
so
abv
is
incidental
and
its
pricey
when
a
fourpack
costs
the
same
as
a
sixpack
would
o
this
is
a
quite
goood
doppelbock
i
like
some
of
the
german
examples
better
but
this
is
still
good
this
is
a
rather
solid
american
version
of
the
german
classic
sam
adams
has
done
a
superb
job
creating
a
balanced
smooth
easy
drinking
high
abv
beer
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
but
it
was
still
a
decent
beer
it
grew
on
my
toward
the
end
overall
a
powerfull
tasting
beer
srong
flavours
and
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
appears
a
dark
mahogany
color
no
visible
hazing
with
a
shortlived
soda
fizzle
sand
colored
head
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
behind
at
the
moment
of
popping
the
cap
there
is
a
very
strange
initial
burst
of
pineapple
upsidedown
cake
aroma
that
settles
back
down
eventually
content
to
be
in
the
background
of
the
multi
faceted
malt
aroma
bready
yeast
caramel
toffee
flavor
is
a
sweet
brown
sugared
and
hearty
raisin
bread
buffet
with
some
small
amounts
of
drying
alcoholic
heat
in
the
finish
although
not
quite
as
boozey
as
oh
say
a
barleywine
would
be
it
still
has
some
mild
hotness
to
it
texture
is
smooth
and
silky
as
it
ought
to
be
but
that
hotness
does
distract
ever
so
slightly
very
slightly
under
carbonated
as
well
for
my
preferences
but
only
just
barely
so
for
me
this
beer
was
like
a
flawed
or
poorly
cut
gemstone
in
that
it
was
a
thing
of
real
beauty
unfortunately
marred
by
a
couple
of
imperfections
decent
for
the
style
i
suppose
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
ive
definitely
had
better
doppelbocks
overall
i
liked
it
but
not
exceedingly
so
would
have
liked
a
more
mellow
taste
though
at
almost
10
its
an
easy
drinker
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
never
been
a
big
sam
adams
fan
but
heard
about
their
imperial
series
and
supposedly
this
one
was
one
of
the
best
in
the
series
so
i
decided
to
give
this
one
a
chance
pours
medium
brown
with
a
reddish
tinge
along
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
very
malty
aromatics
some
notes
of
apple
juice
slight
whiff
of
alcohol
and
a
nice
brown
sugar
note
full
malt
flavor
along
with
some
apple
juice
and
brown
sugar
as
well
malty
with
a
nice
warming
finish
and
crisp
mouthfeel
while
not
a
bad
offering
from
sam
adams
i
will
not
seek
this
one
out
again
poured
a
dark
amber
into
dimpled
mug
with
a
little
bubbly
head
presence
before
dissipating
rapidly
smells
of
malt
and
sour
dough
bread
a
good
mouthfeel
on
the
tongue
velvety
smooth
and
a
bit
thick
with
combo
of
sweet
malt
with
the
alcohol
present
as
well
malty
goodness
but
was
surprised
how
this
reminded
me
of
an
english
barleyine
or
wee
heavy
with
the
combination
of
sweet
malty
thickness
and
evident
alcohol
presence
where
as
with
a
dopplebock
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
carbonation
to
balance
the
sweet
malts
and
alcohol
overall
a
very
good
sipper
with
a
little
burn
in
the
after
taste
good
to
see
sa
showing
they
can
still
put
out
big
beers
as
well
as
good
well
balanced
styles
doppelbock
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
ive
never
encountered
one
this
hot
9

takes
away
the
refreshment
factor
and
makes
it
a
sipper
but
its
a
type
of
beer
thats
good
in
big
sips
pretty
great
but
ill
go
for
an
ayinger
celebrator
or
bells
consecrator
first
after
this
and
the
wee
heavy
im
certainly
going
to
check
out
the
rest
of
the
sam
adams
imperials
o
i
f
you
like
you
beer
on
the
malty
sweet
side
like
i
do
you
will
enjoy
this
beer
considering
the
amount
of
malt
and
other
expensive
ingredients
that
go
into
this
beer
it
is
reasonably
priced
this
fact
coupled
with
it
9

abv
content
there
is
allot
of
bang
for
you
buck
this
is
my
first
dopplebock
but
definately
not
my
last
o
solid
if
not
spectacular
the
hops
were
a
little
too
present
for
my
taste
in
a
dopplebock
but
on
balance
was
still
a
solid
beer
mediumfull
bodied
slightly
sticky
very
creamy
low
carbonation
superb
overall
mouthfeel
up
there
with
the
icons
of
the
style
like
salvator
i
really
enjoyed
coming
back
to
this
one
after
many
years
away
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
the
style
the
beer
looks
beautiful
in
a
tall
glass
full
bubbly
head
deep
amber
color
like
their
wee
heavy
the
first
drink
is
decent
but
grows
excessively
sweet
the
flavors
of
chocolate
and
coffee
would
be
better
if
not
drowned
in
the
higher
alcohol
content
and
sweetness
it
is
milder
than
the
wee
heavy
but
has
some
of
the
same
issues
o
this
is
a
great
beer
the
malty
rich
flavors
and
alcohol
content
make
it
very
enjoyable
to
drink
i
liked
it
very
much
and
even
at
10
for
a
four
pack
i
would
buy
it
again
hazy
brown
with
amber
hues
nice
lacing
tanbrown
single
finger
head
aroma
is
malty
cherry
plum
and
caramel
sweet
and
a
touch
boozy
flavor
is
malty
musty
dark
fruits
and
a
little
boozy
moderate
carbonation
and
medium
in
body
semi
dry
finish
the
booziness
is
near
the
edge
of
being
too
much
otherwise
this
is
a
nicely
complex
bock
overall
i
did
not
buy
this
beer
someone
had
bought
it
for
me
whith
out
knowing
what
kind
of
beers
i
prefer
i
do
not
normally
gravitate
towards
double
bocks
but
i
have
had
several
over
the
years
and
i
usually
end
up
comapring
them
all
to
ayinger
celebrator
double
bock
which
this
beer
pales
in
comparison
to
overall
drinkability
pretty
decent
doppelbock
no
real
off
characters
smooth
and
drinkable
nothing
groundbreaking
though
overall
a
brew
with
the
flavors
interacting
very
well
together
giving
this
beer
a
well
rounded
sweet
fruity
warming
sensation
great
job
a
very
drinkable
double
bock
overall
a
pleasant
doppelbock
but
there
are
other
worthy
choices
i
even
prefer
sam
adamss
chocolate
cherry
bock
to
this
one
this
is
good
stuff
oi
believe
this
is
my
first
doppelbock
and
i
enjoyed
it
a
huge
malt
bomb
but
in
a
good
way
o
really
sorry
i
waited
so
long
to
finally
try
this
i
love
all
the
sam
adams
imperial
series
brews
very
underated
if
you
ask
me
i
see
me
buying
a
bunch
more
of
this
and
seeing
how
it
ages
a
pretty
good
dopplebock
i
really
havent
tried
anything
that
beats
ayingers
but
this
is
pretty
damn
good
and
a
little
reminiscent
of
it
actually
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
not
much
head
retentionlacing
the
color
in
this
lighting
is
a
dark
amber
almost
brown
it
has
good
carbonation
it
smells
malty
and
with
raisin
or
some
dried
fruit
its
decently
hoppy
for
the
style
or
is
that
just
the
alcohol
burn
it
is
almost
10abv
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
and
it
is
a
bit
cheaper
than
a
4
pack
of
celebrator
so
it
might
be
a
good
alternative
to
it
now
and
again
although
from
reading
this
site
i
understand
that
it
is
just
a
seasonal
bummer
what
if
i
want
to
fast
on
beer
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
o
this
was
my
fist
introduction
to
double
or
dopplebock
i
love
this
beer
probably
a
little
partial
to
this
beer
over
other
dopplebocks
because
it
was
my
first
in
this
economy
it
is
always
good
to
buy
american
too
o
very
good
dopplebock
one
of
the
better
sam
adams
beers
ive
had
im
not
a
lager
fan
but
this
is
pretty
good
its
got
a
lot
of
flavor
and
its
very
smooth
for
having
so
much
alcohol
poured
into
my
20
oz
giant
duvel
tulip
poured
this
deep
mahogany
bock
very
aggressive
and
got
a
massive
3
inch
light
tan
head
that
settled
3
minutes
later
into
a
hearty
layer
of
bubbles
the
lacing
left
is
minimal
but
pretty
smell
is
strong
dark
fruits
raisins
and
figs
brown
sugar
breadyness
and
some
warming
booze
taste
is
powerful
with
the
flavors
in
the
nose
but
carmel
surprises
my
palate
threw
out
the
body
is
large
and
that
makes
it
a
sipper
with
a
good
amount
carbonation
for
the
style
on
the
dryer
side
this
is
a
excellent
double
bock
malt
lovers
dream
great
beer
not
much
room
to
improve
a
six
pack
of
this
has
made
it
to
my
christmas
wishlist
o
interesting
beer
very
thick
and
malty
this
would
make
an
excellent
beer
to
watch
a
game
with
and
eat
some
honey
roasted
nuts
about
my
least
favorite
of
the
extreme
or
whatever
series
theyre
calling
it
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
nice
one
finger
off
white
head
decent
lacing
on
my
snifter
glass
reddish
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
nose
is
that
of
caramel
malt
a
hint
of
hops
bread
and
maybe
a
little
nut
in
there
im
really
surprised
by
the
nose
its
really
well
done
very
balanced
and
i
really
dont
get
any
of
the
9
5
abv
in
the
smell
i
get
all
the
smells
in
the
taste
profile
as
well
its
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
but
this
is
a
nice
tasting
doppelbock
very
rich
bready
feel
with
a
slight
alcohol
burn
on
the
aftertaste
the
feel
is
not
quite
as
refined
as
the
taste
its
a
little
out
of
whack
overall
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
beer
from
sam
adams
its
a
little
boozy
on
the
aftertaste
but
i
generally
like
that
cheers
o
this
one
smells
and
tastes
like
liquor
pour
it
into
your
snifter
and
take
your
time
enjoying
the
rich
aroma
and
flavor
perhaps
a
little
pricey
9
994pack
around
here
but
it
is
an
enjoyable
experience
i
intend
to
age
a
few
bottles
o
this
has
pretty
good
drinkability
even
though
it
is
high
in
alcohol
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
nice
flavor
it
actually
doesnt
seem
like
a
bland
version
of
the
style
like
a
lot
of
other
bbc
beers
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
nice
beer
and
i
would
buy
it
again
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pretty
deep
auburn
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
a
bit
on
the
malty
side
taste
is
big
on
alcohol
consider
using
a
shot
glass
for
this
one
some
malts
come
through
after
the
initial
alcohol
burn
feels
medium
bodied
and
very
strong
in
the
mouth
and
overall
i
felt
the
alcohol
dominated
this
beer
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
this
beer
is
great
the
best
sa
ive
had
i
rate
this
only
2nd
to
celebrator
amazing
flavor
for
a
lager
beer
cracks
my
personal
top
20
list
for
sure
which
means
ill
always
have
this
on
hand
in
my
fridge
an
a
ranking
from
me
sweetness
seems
to
be
represented
by
dark
fruits
prunes
and
raisins
hops
are
by
no
means
a
player
in
this
game
maltforward
and
delicious
its
a
beer
that
can
serve
as
a
meal
o
you
cant
go
wrong
with
a
doppelbock
one
of
the
better
servings
from
sam
ive
had
in
a
little
while
ps
i
hate
olives
i
have
to
say
this
beer
is
amazing
i
rarely
rank
a
beer
this
high
but
its
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
all
year
i
just
had
an
ass
kisser
double
ipa
and
this
blows
that
out
of
the
water
the
ass
kisser
is
one
of
the
most
popular
double
ipas
on
the
market
and
has
won
several
awards
over
the
years
this
beer
smells
great
tastes
great
and
leaves
my
mouth
wanting
more
i
am
thirsty
after
each
drink
as
it
leaves
the
mouth
dry
but
who
cares
its
delicious
and
i
just
want
another
drink
bottoms
up

with

that
settles
to

small
streaks
of

form
on
the
glass
on

down
smell
is
of
sweet

caramel
earthy

and
some
spicy
hops
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
bread
caramel
and
some
fruity
flavors
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
carbonation
level
with
a
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
something
i
would
probably
go
for
again
o
a
great
try
at
the
doppelbock
sam
adams
comes
through
with
a
super
malty
traditional
take
on
it
overall
one
of
my
top
beers
drink
slowly
and
savor
thank
you
jim
koch
o
this
is
a
very
approachable
doublebock
despite
its
abv
samuel
adams
seems
to
be
great
at
making
really
impressive
beers
seem
easy
to
drink
this
is
my
first
time
trying
one
of
their
imperial
beers
and
ill
definitely
be
returning
for
more
this
is
a
very
good
sipper
for
9
5
the
alcohol
isnt
overpowering
on
the
palate
but
it
certainly
has
an
effect
appearance
has
a
dark
brown
ruby
red
color
with
a
thin
dissapating
head
smell
of
dark
fruits
and
rich
malts
taste
again
is
very
rich
in
the
dark
fruits
and
malt
hiding
the
alchohol
well
mouthfeel
is
full
and
viscous
with
mild
carbonation
that
makes
it
go
down
smooth
a
bit
spendy
but
makes
for
a
good
sipper
with
fall
around
the
corner
do
an
okay
dopplebock
not
my
favorite
of
dopplebockfest
2011
by
a
longshot
worth
a
try
but
there
are
a
lot
better
options
out
there
for
the
price
overall
pretty
strong
and
tasty
the
alcohol
does
overpower
a
bit
but
the
sweetness
really
comes
out
in
each
drink
loved
the
vanilla
but
wished
it
had
a
little
chocolate
flavor
and
a
little
less
carmal
tastes
strong
dry
alcohol
alongside
dried
fruit
molasses
and
more
burn
definitely
not
bad
but
this
ones
a
slow
sipper
a
good
effort
by
sam
adams
on
a
tough
style
the
flavors
are
rich
and
strong
with
a
pretty
nice
balance
overall
a
good
stab
at
the
style
fits
it
at
least
though
the
benchmark
has
been
raised
over
the
years
this
one
at
least
meets
that
mark
still
m
medium
bodied
really
smooth
with
perfect
carbonation
i
do
admit
to
a
bit
of
bias
here
as
the
original
samuel
adams
double
bock
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
brewery
has
only
improved
on
it
this
imperial
incarnation
has
all
the
flavors
of
a
wellcellared
beer
but
without
all
the
wait
a
very
robust
beer
that
will
age
nicely
plan
on
picking
up
some
more
to
age
a
very
tasty
double
bock
highly
recommended
to
give
one
of
these
guys
a
pour
o
nice
but
too
much
umami
for
most
people
i
would
think
4
i
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
i
thought
i
would
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
think
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
i
have
had
hides
the
alcohol
well
definitely
recommend
o
as
most
reviewers
would
say
this
is
a
malt
bomb
unless
sweet
and
boozy
is
your
thing
but
what
i
have
has
been
drinkable

not
really
a
great

style
i
guess
archetype
of
the
style
isnt
what
they
are
going
for
here
since
it
is
an
imperial
at

and
i
guess
thats
the
best
part
of
it
all
since
what
it

off

this
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
bubbly
tan
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
as
you
drink
the
aroma
is
somewhat
weak
but
there
are
hints
of
caramel
and
some
roasted
barley
the
taste
starts
with
caramel
notes
and
ends
malty
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
with
a
smooth
velvety
finish
overall
worth
a
try
sweetness
dominated
the
nose
with
a
fragrance
of
raisins
upon
tasting
some
hops
broke
through
the
raisin
sweetness
along
with
some
other
sweet
elements
i
couldnt
quite
place
good
structure
provided
by
the
carbonation
bitter
elements
and
malts
felt
nice
in
the
mouth
with
a
bit
of
viscosity
and
creaminess
even
at
9
5
abv
i
found
it
quite
drinkable
im
very
impressed
with
this
beer
from
samuel
adams
its
an
extreme
beer
but
balanced
like
every
other
beer
they
make
its
a
good
thing
this
beer
isnt
all
malts
though
it
does
have
that
bite
from
the
carbonation
and
noble
hops
that
they
use
so
well
crafted
this
is
my
favorite
non
ipa
beer
to
date
the
alcohol
is
actually
very
well
masked
i
had
this
beer
last
year
and
thought
the
alcohol
was
more
noticeable
i
dont
know
if
they
tweaked
the
recipe
or
my
tastes
are
changing
but
this
is
now
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
them
its
pretty
filling
but
definitely
worth
the
4
pack
price
this
beer
lets
everyone
know
samuel
adams
will
always
be
a
craft
brewery
overall
while
this
is
another
example
of
a
too
sweet
usmade
doppelbock
the
flavor
is
strong
enough
for
me
to
ultimately
let
it
slide
pretty
good
overall
d
eh
this
beer
tastes
weird
therefore
i
dont
have
much
desire
to
drink
it
much
its
not
bad
to
drink
but
its
weird
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
very
well
made
doppelbock
with
all
the
rich
malt
sweetness
i
expect
but
still
very
smooth
balanced
and
easy
drinking
dangerously
good
d
good
overall
drink
easy
to
enjoy
for
doppelbock
fans
sweet
caramel
profile
is
memorable
and
i
would
have
a
couple
more
grade
b
purchased
at
stonys
12oz

overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
will
definitely
be
purchasing
this
sporadically
through
the
winter
but
its
definitely
that
a
winter
beer
obviously
since
it
is
seasonal
drink
is
meh
definitely
shows
through
with
the
booze
a
little
sweet
and
syrupy
sticky
finish
and
hint
of
minerality
pour
into
a
glass
it
had
a
small
amount
of
foam
the
look
was
a
dark
beer
with
a
clear
look
there
isnt
a
strong
smell
to
this
beer
but
it
smells
like
hops
the
beer
tastes
like
nuts
spices
and
some
hops
the
after
taste
is
strong
but
finishes
nicely
there
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
in
the
finish
cheers
this
is
a
pretty
awesome
doppelbock
especially
considering
that
its
an
american
interpretation
alcohol
is
present
but
smooth
and
well
integrated
malt
aroma
and
flavor
are
moderately
complex
kudos
boston
beer
co
i
think
they
hit
the
doppelbock
style
on
the
mark
self
proclaimed
most
sought
after
brew
i
see
why
now
after
drinking
one
maybe
their
best
beer
thick
mouthfeel
with
a
buttery
sticky
coating
on
this
healthy
carbonation
definitely
a
sipping
beer
here
at
9
5
poured
into
a
doppelbock
glass
tight
head
and
copper
in
color
low
carbonation
and
no
haze
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
bready
and
boozy
the
alcohol
is
not
well
hidden
here
but
i
really
dont
mind
since
it
is
a
sweet
malt
brew
there
is
a
slick
mouthfeel
and
the
body
is
not
as
heavy
as
one
would
expect
but
you
do
fill
up
from
the
calories
a
good
one
to
change
up
from
all
the
hop
bombs
d
for
being
a
full
bodied
beer
that
is
very
filling
it
is
a
nice
satisfying
beer
to
drink
when
you
just
want
to
relax
with
a
great
tasting
beer
d
this
is
suprisingly
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
taste
although
it
it
slightly
overwhelming
in
the
aroma
its
hard
to
tell
how
strong
the
beer
is
just
by
tasting
it
good
beer
overall
very
impressive
brew
flavor
is
spot
on
for
bocks
and
the
texture
of
this
beer
in
your
mouth
is
wonderful
very
drinkable
good
flavor
color
is
beautiful
and
definitely
a
beer
for
everyone
one
to
try
the
color
was
the
first
major
item
i
noticed
which
is
a
dark
carmel
color
closer
to
mahogany
maybe
the
second
was
smell
and
taste
which
i
really
enjoyed
and
my
wife
seemed
pleased
with
the
flavor
also
she
normally
does
not
enjoy
such
intense
flavors
12
oz
bottle
appears
a
rich
amber
brown
off
white
head
forms
and
recedes
to
a
halo
around
the
glass
little
lace
aroma
is
big
of
malts
sugar
and
alcohol
in
the
flavor
malt
focused
with
nutty
and
bready
notes
alittle
cloying
sweetness
and
some
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
alittle
chewey
a
big
beer
pretty
one
dimensional
but
good
nonetheless
sorry
i
ignored
you
for
so
long
sam
adams
double
bock
i
blame
your
ugly
sister
triple
for
this
let
me
start
off
by
saying
that
i
love
sam
adams
and
it
will
always
have
a
special
place
in
the
part
of
my
heart
that
is
saturated
in
hops
i
remember
this
was
my
first
extreme
beer
experience
many
years
ago
when
sam
adams
was
my
only
craft
beer
but
revisiting
this
beer
was
a
little
disappointing
before
i
get
another
email
from
a
fellow
ba
like
i
did
for
my
review
of
glissade
i
will
state
that
this
was
a
solid
beer
just
not
outstanding
like
i
remembered
the
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
a
little
head
i
didnt
get
much
aroma
maybe
a
little
malty
sweetness
the
taste
is
also
malty
sweetness
its
smooth
just
not
very
tasty
overall
i
will
say
that
the
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
a
good
not
great
bock
d
another
beer
that
id
call
dangerously
drinkable
before
i
noticed
my
glass
was
nearly
empty
the
high
abv
is
masked
by
the
strong
flavors
and
heavy
malt
its
a
level
below
my
favorite
examples
of
the
style
but
those
are
my
favorite
beers
in
the
world
the
best
doppelbock
ive
had
outside
the
german
classics
wow
sam
adams
continues
to
be
americas
best
brewery
for
a
reason
this
double
bock
is
rich
and
creamy
it
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
white
frothy
head
and
zero
carbonation
the
beer
has
a
chocolaty
aroma
and
appearance
and
is
sweet
on
the
pallette
this
beer
is
smooth
and
leaves
a
great
aftertaste
a
very
enjoyable
brew
sam
adams
and
widmer
are
constantly
my
favorite
american
brewers
but
sam
adams
has
yet
to
disappoint
the
best
of
the
sam
adams
collection
imho
did
not
like
the
salty
start
to
this
beer
maybe
there
is
something
wrong
with
my
bottle
and
i
dont
get
as
many
toasty
nutty
notes
as
i
expected
d
delicious
and
dangerous
easy
to
drink
ten
years
ago
when
i
first
tried
this
beer
i
could
not
finish
it
without
a
huge
hangover
the
next
morning
perhaps
ive
matured
but
the
malty
goodness
here
albeit
aged
and
mellowed
was
phenomenal
take
time
and
chew
on
this
one
a
slow
quaff
that
requires
patience
and
a
palate
that
will
absorb
an
intense
malt
assault
in
any
case
a
delight
i
had
a
this
years
ago
before
i
really
got
into
craft
brews
and
remember
hating
it
because
the
alcohol
taste
bothered
me
i
can
now
appreciate
the
actual
taste
of
the
beer
and
not
get
weighed
down
by
the
alcohol
big
difference
from
then
til
now
deach
sip
does
go
down
easily
but
it
does
hit
hard
its
a
great
brew
though
congrats
sam
adams
i
finally
tasted
something
id
buy
again
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
in
one
night
though
due
to
the
weight
but
i
do
love
it
fullbodied
without
being
cloying
though
just
barely
medium
effervescence
aftertaste
is
reminiscent
of
port
or
for
those
who
remember
it
sams
triple
bock
in
the
blue
bottle
the
abv
is
noticeable
throughout
but
it
never
seems
a
problem
as
the
brew
just
begs
to
be
sipped
instead
of
chugged
12
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
brewed
to
23
plato
with
pale
malt
and
crystal
60
and
hopped
with
tettnang
and
hallertau
mittelfruh
served
in
its
own
tulip
glass
it
pours
a
fairly
carbonated
deep
red
with
an
inch
of
frothy
head
that
eventually
falls
to
a
fine
lather
and
leaves
a
few
wisps
of
lacing
smells
sweet
and
caramelly
with
a
hint
of
cherry
tastes
very
rich
but
in
the
wrong
way
there
are
loads
of
raisiny
and
caramelly
sweet
crystal
malts
and
none
of
the
toasty
and
bready
munich
malts
that
mark
a
good
dopplebock
sticky
and
full
body
thick
and
smooth
but
it
could
use
some
more
carbonation
easy
enough
to
drink
but
this
is
too
sweet
and
not
malty
enough
to
make
for
much
of
a
bock
perhaps
a
good
crossover
beer
but
for
petes
sake
throw
some
munich
malt
in
there
with
the
abv
and
the
warm
taste
this
is
something
i
think
i
could
only
really
drink
one
of
and
be
happy
p
s
after
10
minutes
the
beer
is
at
approx
65
f
and
tastes
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
but
thats
a
long
time
to
wait
for
a
beer
to
taste
better
at
9
5
alcohol
and
a
sweet
thick
taste
i
feel
like
one
is
enough
for
the
evening
d
very
smooth
and
sweet
but
its
a
sipper
be
careful
or
it
will
bite
you
drink
for
me
is
nothing
special
its
a
fine
beer
but
doesnt
make
me
want
to
rush
out
and
buy
another
one
right
away
the
beer
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
nice
and
exactly
what
i
expect
in
a
doppelbock
i
get
a
lot
of
toffee
and
sugary
malt
notes
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
dark
fruit
and
some
grape
notes
the
flavor
is
extremely
malty
i
get
a
ton
of
toffee
and
caramel
malt
as
well
as
some
cherries
and
other
dark
fruit
there
is
also
a
nice
brown
sugar
quality
to
the
flavor
and
the
overall
flavor
is
very
sweet
and
malty
there
is
no
hop
presence
in
the
beer
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
one
of
the
better
yearround
samuel
adams
beers
notes
over
all
its
big
and
bold
which
hits
home
for
me
when
were
talking
about
doppelbocks
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
can
not
handle
a
stronger
beer
mainly
because
the
taste
can
overcome
the
senses
but
besides
that
i
love
it
dark
red
hue
when
poured
strong
hop
aroma
very
short
lived
head
very
stout
but
surprisingly
smooth
taste
usually
comes
in
4
packs
but
at
9
5
alcohol
its
adequate
for
a
person
to
enjoy
is
definitely
a
leap
beyond
typical
larger
american
brews
but
sam
adams
has
always
been
a
cut
above
the
rest
overall
impression
i
am
not
partial
to
very
sweet
brews
i
know
that
these
imperial
styles
tend
toward
the
sweet
and
yeasty
in
that
respect
i
assume
anyone
who
love
a
chocolate
stout
or
other
imperial
would
really
find
this
satisfying
im
just
more
partial
to
an
apa
or
ipa
given
the
richness
and
the
9
5
abv
this
is
a
sipper
so
the
drinkability
isnt
what
it
might
otherwise
be
no
problem
though
its
one
of
the
finest
sippers
ive
tried
yet
12
oz
bottle
dark
red
hue
a
small
off
white
short
lived
head
aroma
of
grassy
hops
and
caramel
malt
full
tangy
body
perfume
hops
caramel
malt
alcohol
fill
the
mouth
some
notes
of
cherry
as
well
huge
long
dry
finish
big
nicely
balanced
beer
overall
as
lovers
of
doppelbocks
we
were
left
wanting
more
while
the
traditional
flavoring
was
there
in
a
general
sense
the
dominance
of
the
metallic
aftertaste
was
less
than
desirable
the
color
of
this
beer
is
an
amber
with
a
brown
haze
to
it
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
of
booze
and
roasted
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
of
overpowering
caramel
and
booze
this
is
not
a
balanced
beer
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
and
little
to
no
carbonation
a
sipping
beer
typically
i
shy
away
from
sam
adams
but
this
one
seemed
like
it
might
actually
be
worth
a
try
and
it
didnt
disappoint
the
maltiness
is
very
obvious
as
soon
as
it
hits
your
nostrils
but
isnt
over
powering
in
taste
the
high
alcohol
content
is
also
surprising
and
is
very
drinkable
considering
the
style
of
beer
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
and
i
encourage
anyone
who
normally
glances
over
sam
adams
to
give
it
a
go
d
awful
thick
to
do
more
than
sip
but
a
wonderful
example
of
its
style
ill
likely
be
having
this
again
d
a
very
nice
beer
that
is
definately
worth
trying
and
if
it
was
cheaper
i
would
buy
more
often
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
that
is
well
balanced
with
all
the
complexity
that
goes
with
it
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
if
not
for
the
high
abv
still
3
or
4
of
these
and
i
will
call
it
a
night
d
at
9
5
this
is
big
even
for
a
doppelbock
as
a
sipper
its
fantastic
on
a
brisk
winter
night
d
surprisingly
sweet
but
not
offputting
with
an
abv
that
feels
lower
than
the
identically
alcoholic
imperial
stout
in
the
series
that
same
telltale
peppery
alcohol
is
a
warning
to
not
take
this
beer
too
lightly
the
syrupy
mouthfeel
tends
to
slow
drinking
down
quite
a
bit
and
the
beer
only
gets
more
assertive
with
each
degree
gained
in
temperature
not
a
sipper
in
terms
of
assertiveness
but
certainly
a
beer
to
respect
and
take
the
time
to
appreciate
the
fullbodied
complexity
limits
its
pairings
though
its
quite
good
with
spiced
and
even
spicy
sausages
provided
you
go
easy
on
the
condiments
try
a
bratwurst
with
some
grilled
onions
and
a
dab
of
mayonnaise
on
a
roll
alongside
and
youll
see
that
sometimes
simple
is
best
pours
a
hazy
deep
amber
to
copper
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
roast
a
small
nuttiness
and
dry
alcohol
in
the
taste
a
dry
alcohol
stands
out
with
a
small
sweet
nuttiness
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
nuttiness
and
alcohol
hint
in
the
aftertaste
alcohol
just
stands
out
way
too
much
and
not
really
balanced
d
i
bought
a
4
pack
of
this
one
for
10
it
was
an
alright
beer
but
not
for
the
price
i
couldnt
drink
all
four
at
once
this
is
definitely
a
tasty
doppelbock
since
the
label
says
they
put
enough
malt
in
each
bottle
to
bake
a
loaf
of
bread
im
sure
the
waistline
wont
agree
however
im
impressed
by
this
beers
smoothness
and
sweetness
without
being
over
the
top
pours
a
deep
rubychestnut
color
looks
says
im
a
fall
beer
aromas
of
malty
caramel
ever
present
very
smooth
and
flavorful
on
the
mouth
lots
of
malt
and
caramel
flavors
alcohol
well
hidden
considering
9
5
abv
not
an
easy
beer
to
locate
grab
it
if
you
see
it
this
one
is
perfect
for
a
cold
winter
evening
pours
a
dark
toffee
brown
with
an
off
white
head
and
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
my
pilsner
glass
nose
brings
some
caramel
toffee
and
quite
a
bit
of
booze
taste
is
booze

hints
of
dark
fruit
toffee
and
light
maple
flavoring
mouthfeel
consists
of
a
medium

with
a
lot
of
alcohol
presence
good
flavors
butat
least
when
freshthis
is
dominated
by
a
lot
of
alcohol
warmth
d
a
tasty
brew
but
a
little
sweet
and
thick
for
my
likings
so
i
will
keep
these
to
onebottleanight
sippers
d
this
stuff
is
so
potent
its
giving
me
heartburn
would
not
buy
it
for
a
friend
or
myself
overall
a
rich
double
bock
it
was
very
malty
and
simplistic
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
this
beer
is
very
sweet
but
has
many
complexities
that
keep
it
from
being
bogged
down
reminds
me
of
a
barleywine
with
less
hops
seems
to
like
being
cold
thought
it
was
just
average
at
first
but
really
enjoyed
it
by
the
end
of
glass
a
clear
brown
beer
that
i
assumed
would
be
darker
due
to
my
limited
experience
with
bocks
a
nice
head
came
along
with
good
lacing
the
nose
was
extremely
bready
with
notes
of
chocolate
and
raisins
damn
this
is
complex
raisins
molasses
brandy
dark
malts
milk
chocolatea
rarity
in
beer
dark
fruits
figs
and
vanilla
are
just
a
few
of
my
initial
of
impressions
carbonation
levels
are
on
the
medium
side
very
smooth
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
something
as
complex
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
offering
i
had
this
bottle
in
my
cellar
for
almost
a
year
and
was
amazed
by
the
taste
and
complexities
with
a
high
abv
it
makes
the
drinkability
hard
for
the
novice
beer
drinker
and
great
for
those
of
us
who
love
such
things
ruddy
brown
in
the
glass
with
no
head
at
all
smell
is
sweet
molasses
and
toasted
malt
for
a
lager
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
syrupy
thick
the
finish
isnt
lager
crisp
eitherits
a
bit
sticky
and
resinous
despite
those
alelike
characteristics
both
of
which
i
like
i
still
feel
like
im
drinking
a
lager
some
similarities
to
a
barleywine
though
without
the
pronounced
hops
previously
spaten
optimator
was
probably
my
favorite
in
this
stylethis
compares
well
to
optimator
especially
since
it
has
higher
abv
than
optimator
dont
pass
this
one
up
we
need
more
dopplebocks
like
this
in
the
states
once
again
sam
adams
proves
to
be
better
than
the
lowest
common
denominator
ethanol
is
warming
throughout
drinkability
despite
the
abv
i
find
this
beer
easy
to
drink
the
smoothness
really
contributes
to
the
drinkability
this
is
a
well
rounded
beer
recommended
recommended
d
a
great
beer
but
a
little
heavy
complete
flavour
and
great
aroma
overall
one
hell
of
a
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
thick
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
beige
head
smells
like
licorice
with
caramel
overtones
the
sweet
malts
are
definitely
evident
in
the
taste
but
are
not
overpowering
it
is
well
neutralized
with
a
slight
bitterness
a
complex
brew
and
quite
heavy
in
body
at
9
5
abv
it
packs
a
nice
punch
but
i
really
dont
know
if
it
is
worth
the
price
8
99
per
4
pack
12
oz
but
without
a
doubt
one
of
sam
adams
best
brews
dyeah
i
would
have
another
one
very
warming
and
cheery
d
one
will
do
ya
pours
a
clear
deep
mahogany
with
a
thin
tan
head
smells
of
ripened
malt
porridge
taste
is
brown
sugar
that
has
been
aged
on
oak
up
front
a
super
smokey
middle
and
an
earthy
dextrose
finish
alcohol
is
present
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
super
rich
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
the
high
alcohol
flavors
pretty
much
limit
this
to
one
though
a
very
good
beer
though
just
a
sipper
think
i
was
just
tryin
to
get
er
done
heavy
and
rich
this
would
go
good
with
dark
meat
its
a
bit
hard
to
drink
on
its
own
actually
and
a
bit
too
strong
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
time
interesting
and
tasty
for
the
style
though
a
good
reminder
that
innovation
and
distinction
arent
unique
to
ales
even
if
its
not
something
im
especially
fond
of
myself
d
this
beer
has
a
great
appearance
and
outstanding
aroma
the
taste
is
very
nice
but
the
overall
experience
is
taken
down
a
notch
by
the
overly
thick
mouthfeel
glad
i
tried
it
but
id
take
their
imperial
stout
over
this
one
any
day
why
is
the
style
listed
as
doppelbock
when
its
actually
a
double
bock
teehee
it
pours
a
clear
darkish
amber
brown
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
blackened
biscuits
honey
and
that
englishstyle
toffee
we
always
hear
about
the
taste
mostly
holds
true
to
the
caramel
and
toffee
along
with
some
lessburnt
biscuits
figs
and
a
light
touch
o
booze
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
an
almost
chewy
gummy
perhaps
feel
i
find
this
to
be
the
best
of
the
sa
imperial
series
in
terms
of
taste
and
overall
interpretation
of
style
a
fine
doppelbock
indeed
d
if
not
for
the
strong
9
5
abv
it
would
be
allot
more
drinkable
i
could
really
see
it
being
dangerously
drinkable
with
a
meal
but
drinking
it
along
really
allows
you
to
taste
how
much
alcohol
is
in
it
overall
i
enjoyed
it
but
probably
wouldnt
come
back
to
it
again
worth
a
try
for
sure
though
cheers
d
not
bad
it
has
a
very
wellrounded
balanced
flavor
that
ive
come
to
expect
from
sam
adams
though
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
it
actually
works
well
with
the
dark
sugary
fruity
malt
characteristics
i
could
drink
two
max
samuel
adams
stab
at
a
double
bock
turned
out
pretty
good
it
pours
perfectly
with
lots
of
tan
head
being
produced
along
with
a
clear
and
dark
ruby
red
colored
body
aroma
is
of
cola
sassafras
and
a
hint
of
metallic
character
the
taste
is
sweet
caramel
some
nuttiness
with
a
boozy
finishmouth
feel
is
knocked
down
a
bit
along
with
the
drinkability
due
to
the
strong
booze
finish
however
didnt
get
totally
knocked
down
with
the
brew
having
a
complexity
of
chewiness
and
oily
slickness
that
i
enjoy
drinkability
at
9
5
its
delicious
and
drinkable
and
the
price
is
low
enough
to
make
a
session
out
of
it
this
is
a
classic
bockstyle
beer
di
love
this
brew
but
it
is
not
an
easy
drinking
beer
the
alcohol
is
present
and
that
combined
with
the
rich
flavor
profile
makes
this
a
sipper
for
sure
i
also
cooked
sausage
and
peppers
with
one
of
these
and
it
came
out
really
good
in
my
opinion
a
great
beer
to
relax
and
drink
slowly
and
good
to
cook
with
d
i
liked
this
beer
quite
a
lot
its
not
the
best
doppelbock
but
you
cant
beat
celebrator
so
that
was
no
surprise
i
would
drink
this
one
again
my
favorite
of
sam
adams
imperial
series
highly
recommended
if
you
are
a
samuel
adams
beer
drinker
the
aroma
could
use
a
few
more
amps
but
overall
its
worthy
of
an
ator
suffix
its
got
a
bigger
sense
of
balance
than
many
double
bocks
thats
for
sure
the
abv
is
hefty
and
in
no
way
shy
meaning
it
drinks
well
but
is
always
worthy
of
a
cautious
eye
its
not
overly
inspiring
but
its
beefy
malty
solid
and
a
nice
enough
return
on
the
investment
overall
the
beer
is
still
fantastic
aging
seemed
to
improve
the
bouquet
but
not
the
flavor
d
drinks
quite
easy
for
the
abv
but
its
not
one
id
reach
for
when
thinking
doppelbock
when
thinking
a
good
buzz
with
good
flavor
it
might
enter
the
picture
though
this
double
bock
is
exceedingly
well
textured
and
very
drinkable
i
would
have
liked
just
a
shade
more
spice
in
the
flavor
but
no
matter
what
i
just
couldnt
coax
it
onto
my
palate
overall
though
an
enjoyable
beer
drinkability
dangerously
good
i
could
pound
12
of
these
and
then
be
strung
out
on
the
floor
laying
in
my
own
puke
i
should
be
careful
with
this
shit
drinkability
i
could
drink
these
all
day
even
with
the
higher
abv
fairly
high
carbonation
and
a
full
mouthfeel
but
despite
the
sweetness
and
high
abv
the
quick
finish
left
me
wanting
something
more
substantial
drinks
well
for
the
style
and
for
such
a
strong
beer
almost
too
sweet
but
manages
to
balance
well
d
smooth
sweet
malty
easy
to
drink
beer
my
only
complaint
is
the
smell
it
isnt
offensive
but
it
doesnt
make
someone
yearn
for
this
brew
like
it
should
by
the
looks
of
it
they
changed
the
recipe
for
the
worse
and
ill
have
to
find
out
just
how
bad
but
for
now
i
am
very
content
drinking
this
well
done
jim
d
definitely
a
sipper
it
smoothed
out
a
lot
and
settled
down
as
it
warmed
but
it
still
felt
pretty
uneven
overwhelmingly
sweet
almost
to
a
sickening
point
for
me
admittedly
i
am
more
of
a
hop
person
but
i
am
starting
to
appreciate
malt
and
the
sweetness
that
comes
with
it
still
i
did
not
enjoy
this
very
much
taste
is
pretty
good
its
not
the
best
doppelbock
ive
had
but
its
pretty
cool
its
caramel
and
slightly
sweet
up
front
some
carbonation
in
the
mouth
good
mouthfeel
and
some
roast
in
the
back
drinkability
is
ok
its
very
alcohol
forward
but
this
if
fresh
so
i
will
have
to
review
it
again
in
about
68
months
if
i
can
hold
off
that
long
very
please
with
this
brew
quite
delicious
drinkability
drinkability
is
pretty
good
da
nice
doppelbock
a
bit
plain
but
still
a
good
tasting
beer
and
could
definately
be
cellared
for
za
bit
to
take
off
its
alcohol
edge
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
very
heavy
filling
beer
that
is
great
to
warm
you
up
in
the
winter
months
perfect
rendition
of
the
style
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
this
brewery
drinkability
in
my
opinion
you
get
too
much
unbridled
alcohol
and
therefore
lacks
complexity
you
arent
going
to
be
having
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
it
is
something
to
sip
rule
of
thumb
let
your
beers
of
8abv
and
higher
warm
before
you
drink
them
from
your
fridge
i
could
have
liked
this
beer
if
it
werent
for
the
overwhelming
alcoholic
presence
it
kicks
you
in
the
teeth
from
the
getgo
it
ruined
any
nuances
in
taste
i
may
have
otherwise
picked
up
i
finished
the
first
34
of
my
glass
before
it
got
too
warm
to
handle
will
probably
not
be
seeking
this
out
again
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
for
9
5
this
is
a
fairly
easy
drinker
as
the
alcohol
is
hidden
wuite
well
although
it
does
sneak
up
overall
very
enjoyable
and
worth
having
again
great
jobs
sa
this
is
the
best
of
your
imperial
series
and
one
of
your
best
beers
ever
buy
again
yes
clear
dark
ruby
appearance
smell
is
pretty
bold
and
coffeelike
hints
at
the
abv
ok
head
that
never
really
followed
the
beer
around
good
and
dark
chocolatey
sweet
and
packs
a
punch
i
think
this
one
is
served
well
by
the
increased
alcohol
because
it
cuts
through
some
of
the
malty
extremeness
nearly
a
barleywine
in
style
excellent
brew
for
cigar
night
taste
is
smooth
and
creamy
huge
caramel
malt
presence
soft
carbonation
really
adds
to
the
creamy
mouthfeel
not
really
picking
up
much
dark
fruit
or
candied
sugar
like
you
would
expect
aftertaste
has
a
strong
alcoholic
burn
the
combination
made
this
a
very
nice
drinkable
beer
hats
off
to
sam
adams
for
this
gem
if
you
try
it
at
first
and
it
isnt
quite
up
to
standards
try
letting
it
age
a
bit
in
your
fridge
this
beer
is
a
winner
d
while
i
respect
sam
adams
i
do
think
they
pushed
it
a
little
bit
with
their
double
bock
i
would
tone
down
the
alcohol
content
and
strive
for
a
more
prominent
malt
backbone
instead
im
left
with
about
an
average
drinking
experience
so
there
you
go
average
the
body
was
the
typical
sticky
fullness
of
the
style
drinkability
was
good
but
not
special
overall
a
decent
example
of
the
style
worth
a
shot
and
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
d
not
too
bad
for
a
high
abv
beer
a
tasty
brew
and
strong
beer
for
sam
adams
with
excellent
mouthfeel
about
what
i
expected
from
this
beer
this
is
a
sipper
given
my
limited
experience
with
the
style
i
found
this
to
be
a
good
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
brown
with
a
cream
colored
head
that
lingers
around
the
top
smell
is
a
deep
sweet
malt
with
some
alcohol
coming
through
taste
is
a
very
rich
malty
sweet
with
some
carbonation
present
and
alcohol
warming
a
very
rich
malty
mouthfeel
tastes
linger
in
the
mouth
for
a
while
highly
recommend
if
you
like
a
more
extreme
dopplebock
d
yup
another
good
score
here
you
are
drinking
nearly
10
abv
here
but
you
dont
necessarily
know
it
thats
a
good
thing
to
some
and
not
to
others
so
it
depends
on
your
likes
best
sa
beer
i
have
had
in
a
few
years
carbonated
for
sure
bubbly
even
in
the
mouth
good
mouthfeel
not
the
best
drinkability
because
of
the
in
your
face
alcohol
presence
this
pours
extremely
deep
red
with
hints
of
lighter
red
hues
in
it
the
head
was
a
creamy
off
whitelight
brown
smells
are
barely
there
but
you
can
get
the
wiff
of
thick
malts
to
come
this
is
definitely
nutty
and
the
alcohol
is
present
the
second
it
hits
your
lips
mild
on
hop
bitterness
and
sweet
on
the
way
down
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
not
quite
syrupy
i
feel
like
im
sipping
on
burbon
carbonation
is
somewhat
high
making
it
a
bit
lighter
than
it
actually
is
as
it
goes
down
it
leaves
little
to
no
lacing
and
nothing
sticks
to
the
glass
conclusion
if
i
wanted
a
sweet
malty
explosion
in
my
brain
then
i
would
still
look
elsewhere
d
high
abv
rich
beer
sweet
flavors
cant
have
too
many
of
these
but
it
is
certainly
a
tasty
treat
notes
a
very
enjoyable
domestic
dopplebock
recommended
gave
this
one
a
try
last
evening
had
been
meaning
to
get
through
the
imperial
series
from
sam
adams
but
since
it
is
so
readily
available
i
have
passed
well
not
tonight
this
brew
poured
to
a
nice
brownish
amber
color
with
a
thick
light
tan
head
that
had
excellent
retention
and
left
real
nice
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
great
mix
of
malts
roasted
caramel
and
slightly
biscuit
like
also
present
where
brown
sugar
alcohol
and
dark
fruit
aromas
that
mixed
so
well
with
the
malt
scents
made
it
smell
rich
and
very
inviting
the
flavors
where
just
as
good
as
the
aroma
malt
flavor
is
just
perfect
caramel
like
with
a
slight
roasted
property
warming
alcohol
that
is
there
just
to
accompany
the
flavors
in
no
way
burning
this
brew
turned
out
to
be
a
delight
it
really
hit
the
spot
on
a
cold
night
sa
has
a
nice
brew
here
with
this
one
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
people
who
want
to
try
the
style
overall
i
am
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
bier
i
am
not
a
big
sam
adams
fan
and
the
higher
alcohol
content
biers
to
me
usually
lack
sufficient
taste
but
this
one
was
wonderful
and
i
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
prosit
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
more
like
an
ale
than
a
lager
a
little
shaving
off
of
the
sugar
taste
would
do
much
to
improve
this
great
smelling
sipping
beer
notes
a
good
brew
from
boston
beer
but
lacks
a
thing
or
two
to
make
it
memorable
or
really
notable
okay
im
going
against
the
grain
here
i
poured
this
one
into
a
pilsener
glass
at
about
45
deg
it
looked
really
nice
with
a
rich
cherry
color
and
moderate
carbonation
head
was
kind
of
lazy
but
hung
around
a
while
the
smell
had
me
anticipating
rich
malts
with
sugary
aftertones
then
i
tasted
it
i
still
havent
figured
out
how
you
can
make
a
rootbeer
float
look
like
beer
sam
did
it
here
everything
about
this
beer
including
the
hops
is
drenched
in
sugary
syrup
mouthfeel
is
sticky
sweet
on
the
plus
side
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
again
drenched
in
syrup
making
the
drinkability
average
d
its
a
big
boy
in
abv
so
respect
it
or
it
might
kick
your
ass
haha
cheers
the
bottle
im
reviewing
is
pushing
812
months
and
im
not
sure
if
its
my
palette
or
the
beer
changed
as
it
slightly
aged
i
remember
first
trying
this
when
it
was
fresh
and
thinking
it
was
the
closest
american
beer
ive
ever
had
to
a
german
style
it
tasted
very
german
in
the
beginning
now
after
sitting
for
several
months
i
have
to
say
that
i
like
it
much
better
i
could
be
imagining
things
further
im
not
a
huge
sam
adams
fan
and
im
really
enjoying
this
very
well
done
from
an
unmarked
or
undated
12
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
on
january
27
2010
and
served
at
a
temperature
of
about
4748
degrees
it
has
a
handsome
looking
ruby
red
pour
with
excellent
clarity
but
little
in
the
way
of
head
or
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
powerful
mix
of
sweet
malts
floral
perfumes
and
molasses
the
medium
to
bold
mouthfeel
also
has
a
nice
creamy
feel
to
it
on
the
tongue
the
taste
is
more
akin
to
licorice
hops
and
alcohol
there
is
a
9
5
abv
but
i
kind
of
wished
the
alcohol
was
better
masked
still
it
was
a
very
nice
beer
in
the
end
i
sure
didnt
look
at
the
label
close
enough
to
see
that
this
brew
is
9
5
i
had
just
finished
a
16oz
can
of
another
brew
when
i
opened
this
one
up
my
gosh
the
color
just
doesnt
tell
you
what
is
coming
next
amazing
to
say
the
least
you
can
only
know
this
one
by
trying
it
great
brew
not
to
be
taken
lightly
sam
adams
routinely
produces
top
notch
buyanywhere
beers
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
clear
deep
crimsonbrown
color
with
a
thin
but
semiactive
tan
head
the
nose
seems
a
bit
onedimensional
with
a
malty
sweet
brown
sugar
note
with
just
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
mingled
in
one
dimensional
but
good
the
flavor
on
the
other
hand
seems
to
explode
with
depth
the
premise
is
basically
the
same
as
the
nose
but
with
a
whole
new
layer
of
complexity
chocolate
brown
sugar
molasses
dates
figs
and
a
bit
of
smoke
combine
to
make
this
an
excellent
doppelbock
the
mouthfeel
is
all
of
full
bodied
with
a
minimal
carbonation
that
suits
the
beer
well
goes
down
extremely
smooth
and
leaves
a
slick
yet
drying
finish
overall
dangerously
drinkable
with
the
deceivingly
high
abv
try
this
one
for
sure
cheers
has
a
very
rich
strongly
malty
somewhat
yeasty
and
subtly
fruity
and
smoky
aroma
very
inviting
pours
a
dark
clear
mahogany
with
a
thick
fluffy
light
buff
head
that
likes
to
stick
around
strong
spicy
flavor
attacks
the
tongue
with
some
hoppy
bitterness
and
a
firm
alcohol
bite
it
has
a
smooth
malty
slightly
fruity
undertone
that
cools
on
its
way
down
the
pipes
finish
is
lipsmacking
jagged
zingy
tingly
and
spicy
all
in
all
this
beer
wont
blow
you
out
of
your
socks
however
it
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
i
feel
this
beer
would
be
better
if
it
wasnt
as
big
as
it
is
the
high
abv
and
heaviness
of
the
brew
take
away
from
drinkability
points
on
this
one
drinkability
high
abv
means
this
is
a
sipper
and
i
wouldnt
have
too
many
of
these
not
bad
though
and
i
would
have
again
drinkability
it
was
wonderful
experience
drinking
this
beer
too
often
american
brewers
use
a
sledgehammer
to
beef
up
an
otherwise
mild
style
but
here
they
managed
to
stay
fairly
true
to
the
beer
yet
produce
a
big
ale
deserving
of
the
imperial
moniker
well
done
sam
adams
drinkability
it
was
enjoyable
but
the
alcohol
was
too
noticeable
in
this
one
it
would
have
been
a
very
smooth
and
sweet
beer
but
the
alcohol
cut
right
through
it
that
being
said
it
was
a
good
beer
and
one
i
was
impressed
with
from
sam
adams
d
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
this
selection
from
the
bbc
this
is
a
well
crafted
brew
that
hits
all
the
style
characteristics
that
i
look
for
alcohol
is
always
warm
but
never
completely
out
of
control
it
can
taste
a
little
watered
down
at
times
overall
this
beer
is
easily
above
average
i
could
see
having
more
of
this
brew
even
in
the
same
session
pours
to
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
one
finger
head
that
doesnt
dissipate
too
quickly
sort
of
alcoholic
aroma
with
a
malty
caramel
character
taste
is
of
nuts
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
with
some
alcoholic
flavor
in
the
mix
mouthfeel
is
rather
heavy
any
thicker
and
it
would
be
syrup
it
has
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
red
hue
there
was
about
two
fingers
of
tan
head
that
later
mad
for
some
nice
lacing
it
has
a
strong
roasted
wood
like
flavor
there
are
tones
of
caramel
malt
alcohol
and
some
hops
it
is
a
little
bit
chocolate
like
in
the
aftertaste
its
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
d
a
filling
beer
i
could
most
certainly
use
it
as
a
meal
i
like
it
alot
pours
bloodyruby
red
in
body
with
fleeting
white
head
aroma
of
dark
fruit
black
cherries
malt
alcohol
caramel
thick
flavors
of
caramel
dark
fruits
prunes
black
cherries
syrup
heavy
bodied
brew
with
syrupy
characteristics
the
alcohol
doesnt
interfere
too
much
with
the
taste
which
creates
a
very
drinkable
ale
welcome
the
winter
now
i
just
wish
i
had
another
all
i
had
saved
is
this
one
from
april
there
aint
no
mo
tastes
holy
malty
beers
very
sweet
flavor
loaded
with
character
and
appeal
a
touch
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
defiantly
a
big
bold
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
folks
do
yourself
a
favor
and
run
out
and
grab
a
bottle
of
too
and
enjoy
cheers
d
definitely
drinkable
pretty
good
beer
from
sam
adams
drinkability
not
as
much
of
a
meal
in
a
glass
but
dont
drink
quickly
d
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
too
many
of
these
maybe
23
because
of
the
weight
it
has
in
my
stomach
but
i
could
drink
these
in
my
regular
rotation
overall
this
beer
is
just
too
sweet
to
be
very
drinkable
i
guess
if
you
are
craving
pure
malty
sweetness
this
would
be
a
good
bet
but
it
is
just
not
my
style
of
beer
not
a
huge
sam
adams
fan
but
this
one
was
pretty
great
d
wow
i
like
i
like
never
ceases
to
amaze
me
how
sam
adams
almost
always
hits
the
mark
with
their
beers
id
buy
this
sucker
again
in
a
second
sippability
is
high
glad
to
finally
have
tried
this
beer
overall
a
maltbomb
mealinaglass
doverall
i
liked
this
beer
the
high
abv
crept
up
on
me
and
would
keep
me
from
drinking
more
than
one
a
nice
beer
but
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
for
beers
of
this
style
this
beer
is
just
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
still
a
drinkable
beer
drinkability
i
know
that
a
4
seems
high
for
something
pushing
10
abv
but
the
smell
and
flavors
are
just
so
great
with
this
beer
and
the
price
is
right
perfect
for
a
nice
cool
fallwinter
evening
overall
very
drinkable
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
heavy
on
the
alcohol
but
not
something
you
notice
half
way
through
a
glass
still
looking
for
double
chocolate
stout
heard
sams
made
one
yet
to
find
all
in
all
a
sweet
alcoholic
brew
with
moderate
drinkability
dont
know
if
its
a
favorite
but
i
did
enjoy
it
and
its
definitely
worth
experiencing
overall
this
is
another
fine
product
by
one
of
the
best
american
brewers
i
recommend
trying
this
one
im
planning
on
having
the
other
two
of
the
imperial
series
after
my
excellent
impression
of
this
beer
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
from
sam
adams
but
a
sipper
for
sure
due
to
the
high
abv
a
malt
bomb
for
sure
very
warming
with
alcohol
as
i
swallow
slight
bitterness
also
felt
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
feels
a
bit
syrupy
low
to
medium
carbonation
some
warmth
going
down
but
overall
a
pretty
nice
doppelbock
drinkability
is
great
nicely
balanced
i
could
easily
drink
a
whole
bunch
of
this
one
and
get
into
trouble
when
that
9
5
starts
kicking
in
good
stuff
d
was
expecting
a
lopsided
taste
heavy
on
the
malts
with
no
hop
flavor
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
alcohol
was
a
little
heavy
on
the
aftertaste
but
overall
really
enjoyed
the
experience
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
velvety
smooth
and
slightly
sweet
the
body
of
beer
is
medium
body
and
the
finish
is
medium
the
beer
is
loaded
with
a
lot
malt
the
head
is
sorely
disappointing
there
is
not
a
lot
of
effervescence
in
the
beer
either
it
is
not
a
great
beer
but
descent
drinkability
a
decent
dopplebock
and
right
in
line
with
most
of
sas
other
beers
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
nothing
extraordinary
while
this
dopplebock
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
its
german
counterparts
id
still
recommend
this
one
to
almost
anyone
pours
opaque
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
laces
like
my
grandmother
if
she
had
practiced
better
living
through
chemistry
smells
malty
sweet
with
a
dark
fruity
undertone
tastes
woody
up
front
then
melts
into
a
delicious
sweet
molases
maltiness
with
a
dry
nutmegesque
finish
nice
mouthfeel
is
wellcarbonated
and
then
slippery
drinkability
is
fantastic
not
too
sweet
not
too
dry
just
out
and
out
depour
me
anotherlicious
d
very
smooth
and
drinkable
a
definite
sipping
and
savoring
beer
for
the
cooler
months
very
reminiscent
of
bavarian
eisbocks
d
as
doppelbocks
go
this
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
youll
find
the
only
other
doppelbocks
against
which
i
can
compare
samuel
adams
double
bock
are
paulaner
salvator
and
aventinus
and
the
american
offering
does
not
fall
short
great
hearty
boozy
darkness
malty
and
decidedly
so
velvety
in
the
mouth
the
desired
warmth
on
the
tongue
is
present
as
is
the
afterglow
makes
one
know
he
is
drinking
beer
one
complaintso
drinkable
that
one
can
fall
off
the
couch
before
he
knows
what
hit
him
stick
to
one
and
take
your
time
good
beer
good
for
winter
as
the
alcohol
is
hidden
in
the
sugar
this
beer
could
easily
be
confused
with
a
barley
wine
the
sharpness
of
a
lager
is
lost
here
and
runs
more
along
the
vein
of
an
ale
oh
and
do
i
feel
a
bit
of
deja
vu
from
the
triple
bock
some
of
those
maple
notes
are
very
similar
dark
mahogany
with
some
reddish
in
there
small
head
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
very
malty
some
spices
and
some
alcohol
the
taste
is
beautiful
roasted
malt
in
abundance
with
some
caramel
maybe
a
hint
of
coffee
malt
in
there
and
a
very
small
hint
of
alcohol
as
its
going
down
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
samuel
adams
samuel
adams
double
bock
imperial
pours
a
beautiful
deep
brown
in
my
glass
mild
carbonation
and
small
head
round
out
the
appearance
not
a
whole
lot
of
aroma
but
i
can
detect
a
boatload
of
malts
the
flavor
is
of
malts
and
earthy
spiciness
its
delicious
and
much
better
than
i
expected
this
is
a
slow
sipper
for
me
due
to
the
richness
rather
than
the
alcohol
burn
not
much
burn
here
considering
the
alcohol
content
very
nicely
done
poured
into
the
new
sa
glass
a
cloudy
brown
color
nice
carbonation
tiny
fizzy
offwhite

some
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
hint
of
alcohol
spices
and
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
hints
of
alcohol
slight
spice
and
caramel
there
is
a
nice
sweetness
in
the
finish
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
recommended
i
hate
that
i
was
unable
to
sample
double
bock
in
its
past
incarnation
some
reviewers
on
here
claim
it
was
superior
to
this
new
imperial
series
version
that
mustve
been
one
helluva
beer
because
this
double
bock
was
excellent
a
fine
offering
from
jim
and
crew
and
one
i
will
be
buying
when
i
can
find
it
this
is
a
very
filling
beer
and
really
must
be
sipped
to
be
properly
enjoyed
but
it
is
hard
for
me
to
set
it
down
as
every
sip
leaves
me
wanting
more
d
surprisingly
drinkable
stuff
given
the
high
abv
coupled
with
the
hugely
sweet
flavors
and
aromas
d
a
little
boozy
but
very
enjoyable
i
enjoyed
this
one
always
love
a
good
sam
adams
last
one
to
try
of
the
sa
imperial
series
loved
the
stout
white
not
so
good
now
time
for
the
double
bock
pours
a
nice
reddish
brown
color
not
too
much
of
a
head
slight
lacing
smell
is
booze
booze
and
more
booze
whoa
that
will
clear
your
nostrils
nice
mouthfeel
to
this
one
though
lighter
body
than
i
expected
and
some
great
dark
fruit
taste
to
it
you
get
the
booze
at
the
end
but
this
tastes
like
a
fine
spirit
right
here
that
will
put
some
hair
on
your
chest
a
great
night
cap
and
a
beer
to
sip
and
appreciate
for
sure
highly
recommended
i
couldnt
drink
too
many
because
of
the
high
alcohol
percentage
but
it
taste
good
soo
its
definitly
worth
trying
reccomended
drinkability
even
with
the
9
5
abv
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
i
attribute
this
to
the
balance
of
flavors
no
one
flavor
signature
is
overwhelming
12oz
poured
a
reddishbrown
with
a
thin
foamy
tan
head
nice
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
were
abundantly
sweet
and
malty
nice
full
nose
of
toffee
brown
sugar
and
caramel
tastes
were
pleasant
as
well
and
consisted
of
bready
malt
brown
sugar
toffee
and
a
touch
of
caramel
with
some
mild
fruity
notes
as
well
alcohol
is
present
and
comes
across
boozy
but
warming
definitely
a
sipper
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
overall
very
good
representation
of
the
style
so
far
the
imperial
series
has
been
good
d
like
a
chimay
you
dont
go
and
buy
a
six
of
this
and
go
sit
by
the
river
this
is
to
be
shared
with
friends
that
appreciate
what
the
boys
in
boston
have
done
nice
drinkability
this
is
a
sipper
for
me
great
for
dessert
taste
hints
of
dried
fruit
and
spices
along
with
a
pleasant
malt
flavor
that
is
balanced
by
a
little
bitterness
alcohol
is
also
noticeable
with
slight
warming
sensation
on
the
palate
the
beer
exhibits
a
smooth
silky
mouthfeel
that
lingers
briefly
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
that
is
highly
drinkable
d
this
is
another
hit
for
sam
adams
one
that
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
on
a
regular
basis
as
a
rule
you
would
not
be
drinking
many
of
these
at
a
sitting
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
and
warming
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
slowly
and
pairs
nicely
with
the
pepper
jack
cheese
im
now
eating
with
the
rest
of
the
glass
this
beer
is
good
i
was
looking
for
the
right
occasion
to
finally
drink
it
and
this
cool
summer
night
seems
appropriate
this
is
not
a
session
beer
by
any
means
but
i
would
not
hesitate
to
revisit
this
beer
in
the
future
drinkability
it
is
tough
to
rate
or
justify
a
rating
for
styles
like
this
but
i
am
sipping
this
slowly
and
i
dont
think
i
will
have
another
that
was
the
method
used
hence
the
above
score
d
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
without
being
overwhelming
dfairly
solid
a
tasty
easy
to
drink
beer
too
bad
its
so
dull
to
look
at
not
a
bad
effort
by
bbc
certainly
not
the
best
dbon
the
planet
but
a
nice
introduction
to
the
style
drinkability
a
great
lager
overall
but
still
has
some
lagerness
too
it
its
crisp
and
complex
but
certain
flavors
are
too
prominent
and
the
abv
is
not
shielded
well
the
9
5
abv
is
all
too
obvious
in
the
brew
the
rasinydark
fruit
taste
is
too
overwhelming
and
the
finnish
is
rather
dry
overall
though
a
fantastic
and
complex
lager
d
this
would
be
a
sipping
beer
what
with
the
hi
alcohol
the
sweet
maltiness
offsets
the
alcohol
enticing
you
to
continue
on
the
next
bottle
cheers
d
if
you
can
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
there
is
something
wrong
with
you
incredibly
strong
and
filling
this
is
one
hell
of
a
hearty
beer
the
definition
of
a
sipper
drowning
out
what
could
be
one
of
the
best
sam
adams
there
is
not
bad
and
definately
something
that
you
could
enjoy
for
a
while
i
am
interested
in
what
an
aged
bottle
of
this
stuff
would
taste
like

smooth
this

will

the

with
maybe
a

there
is
also
present
a
little
whiff
of
alcohol
in

the
taste
is
luxurious
malt
with
a
slight
toastiness

a
little
nuttiness

earthy
flavors
are

well
against

combined

with

over

its

a

i
am
disappointed
by
this
offering
from
what
i
otherwise
consider
to
be
a
great

either
that
or
dont
drink
this
stuff
wearing

comparing
it

since
you
dont
usually
get
a
flavor
this
big
from
a

just
enough
hops
for
some

mouthfeel
is

this
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
regularly
available
bottled
beers
from

but
this
is
much
more
drinkable
the
only
real
drawback
i
see
is
what
i
see
the
appearance
is
very
murky

obviously
the
aroma
is

theres
brown

fermented

along
with
cherry
liqueur
the
taste
is
bold
and
heavy
was
much
more
hidden
in
the
taste
the
hops
were
also
weak
this
beer
is
all
about
the
maltyness
very
thick
in
body
and
rich
in
taste
the
malts
begin
with
caramel
in
flavor
but
a
dry
maltyness
follows
that
butterscotch
becomes
more
prevalent
the
further
i
go
a
smoky
woodsy
flavor
hides
in
the
background
and
keep
this
beer
from
being
too
cloying
strong
smoky
aftertaste
that
just
stays
on
the

alcohol

it

this

was

solid
bock
o
i
have
not
had
this
in
about
15
years
so
it
was
interesting
to
revisit
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
but
within
the
style
of
doppelbock
so
do
gentlemen
prefer
this
kind
of
doppelbock
regardless
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
goldenbrass
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
biscuit
honey
a
hint
of
vanilla
sweet
flowers
and
a
twang
of
candied
orange
peel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
pinch
of
clove
a
hint
of
sweet
corn
and
an
extra
tad
of
breadiness
theres
a
definite
sense
of
booze
in
there
but
it
doesnt
have
all
that
much
effect
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
mostly
smooth
feel
overall
a
solid
doppelbock
as
per
usual
when
capital
is
involved
though
im
not
sue
the
blondeness
was
all
that
effective
in
the
final
execution
i
mean
i
like
this
beer
but
their
other
dbocks
just
hold
up
a
bit
better
in
my
eyes
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
goblet
from
the
bottle
with
a
golden
appearance
it
had
about
34
inch
head
with
a
slight
yellow
tint
to
the
white
bubbles
the
beer
smelled
like
a
good
german
beer
one
can
smell
the
grain
as
well
as
the
alcohol
even
in
the
aroma
one
detects
a
certain
measure
of
creaminess
on
the
initial
taste
one
detects
buttermilk
biscuits
earthy
grass
notes
a
hint
of
spiciness
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
corn
to
lend
the
creaminess
of
the
beer
as
is
traditionally
the
case
a
doppelbock
is
a
meal
in
itself
the
thickness
allows
the
taste
to
stick
to
the
back
of
the
throat
as
the
biscuits
turns
sour
and
fade
in
terms
of
the
style
i
miss
the
darker
notes
of
a
regular
doppelbock
the
blonde
version
is
solid
but
leaves
something
to
be
desired
i
tried
so
hard
to
find
something
nice
to
say
about
this
beer
but
its
so
hard
when
i
find
a
beer
that
has
very
little
to
offer
i
was
hoping
that
not
all
of
these
tasted
like
this
so
i
bought
another
bottle
from
another
store
i
got
the
same
thing
from
the
second
bottle
fool
me
once
shame
on
you
fool
me
twice
shame
on
me
o
it
shouldnt
be
news
to
anyone
that
a
lager
doppelbock
especially
from
capital
brewery
would
be
anything
less
than
great
this
aged
blonde
doppelbock
shows
faint
signs
of
degradation
with
a
faint
overall
cellar
mustiness
but
it
remains
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
regardless
i
cant
wait
for
capital
bockfest
next
weekend
a
good
bock
that
has
a
few
flaws
holding
it
back
but
i
drink
this
if
offered
it
wouldnt
buy
it
again
though
o
well
put
together
rich
flavor
but
very
straight
forward
extremely
drinkable
could
use
more
complexity
then
again
i
am
comparing
it
too
bells
consecrator
which
is
a
malt
bomb
for
a
blonde
dopplebock
it
is
exactly
what
i
expect
comments
this
beer
taste
more
like
a
malt
cordial
than
what
most
people
think
of
as
beer
at
7
8
it
is
more
of
a
treat
than
something
you
would
drink
with
dinner
still
a
very
special
treat
for
malt
lovers
ibu

estimated
owith
just
the
one
sample
i
leaned
toward
giving

and
sample
some
before
elevating
the
rating
behind

if
you
are
in
southern
wisconsin
and
are
looking
for
a

beer
would
pair

red
meats
this
is
one
you
need
to
try
not
bad
but
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
either
somewhat
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
blonde
with

character
i
would
expect
what
is
basically
a
hellesbock
to
have
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
to
it
and
perhaps
a
bit
higher
bitterness
the
aroma
is
quite
pleasant
but
the
flavor
dissipates
quickly
on
the
palate
and
the
alcohol
in
the
finish
is
maybe
a
tad
harsh
pretty
drinkable
but
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
this
is
another
quality
interesting
doppelbock
from
capital
while
needing
a
reduction
in
alcohol
to
showcase
the
full
extent
of
its
qualities
it
is
still
quite
enjoyable
enjoyable
to
consume
now
and
hopefully
in
a
future
where
the
abv
is
knocked
down
a
notch
d
interesting
taste
profile
not
a
bad
brew
d
a
pretty
nice
dopple
bock
it
kind
of
straddles
the
line
between
a
dark
bock
and
a
helles
bock
with
a
brown
color
that
adds
some
nutty
complexity
to
the
malt
profile
and
a
light
enough
malt
character
that
the
hops
can
shine
through
a
bit
well
done
taste
is
where
the
malt
is
at
sweet
delicious
malts
an
interesting
spectrum
of
grainy
goodness
the
flavor
profile
of
an
excellent
doppelbock
somewhat
hampered
by
being
overly
hot
with
abv
around
the
edges
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
pleasant
however
balance
is
good
throughout
nicely
warming
at
7
8
fullbodied
and
lightly
effervescent
somewhat
clingy
almost
cloying
after
the
swallow
though
with
a
coating
on
the
tongue
and
palate
aftertaste
is
very
nice
and
mellows
well
glad
i
bought
the
4pack
and
not
just
a
single
this
one
pours
a
fairly
clear
orangered
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
that
goes
down
fairly
quickly
but
a
bit
of
head
lasts
for
quite
some
time
aroma
is
grainy
malty
citrusy
and
a
bit
alcoholic
the
taste
here
is
quite
interesting
the
main
thing
i
get
on
the
tongue
is
booze
but
its
not
overbearing
its
actually
tempered
well
with
some
green
apple
grains
lemons
and
caramel
malts
but
yeah
its
a
boozy
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
and
decently
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
considering
the
booziness
this
brew
almost
reminds
me
of
a
barleywine
since
the
alcohol
is
just
so
forward
either
way
its
a
solid
beer
overall
not
to
bad
i
love
a
good
dopplebock
ive
never
seen
a
blonde
one
before
so
i
was
happy
to
try
it
o
not
great
but
far
enough
above
average
to
revisit
in
the
future
do
quite
refreshing
even
for
a
higher
abv
beer
a
four
pack
of
this
in
the
summer
would
be
great
for
wasting
away
an
afternoon
outside
capital
knows
doppelbocks
period
bottle
gifted
from
the
brewmaster
and
from
the
owner
in
tampa
meetup
told
this
bottle
ages
for
eight
years
or
more
but
it
was
hot
out
and
the
bottle
cold
drinkability
was
ok
d
i
can
say
its
the
best
i
have
tried
out
of
several
from
this
brewery
but
i
dont
think
i
would
go
back
to
back
with
this
overall
this
is
a
delicious
summer
time
bock
it
does
pack
a
bit
more
punch
than
your
typical
warm
weather
beer
but
the
flavor
unlike
darker
bocks
is
still
fairly
light
and
refreshing
pours
a
pale
amber
color
with
a
thin
and
fastly
diminishing
head
some
scents
of
sweet
carmel
malts
grainy
wheats
and
a
little
lemon
citrus
packs
a
bold
taste
for
a
lighter
colored
beer
a
very
complex
mix
of
malts
and
grains
that
leave
a
very
dry
taste
in
your
mouth
interesting
to
say
the
least
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
light
but
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
overall
this
should
be
the
official
drink
of
march
in
wisconsin
it
looks
like
summers
coming
but
it
gives
you
what
you
need
for
march
something
worth
looking
forward
to
every
year
editi
have
held
onto
a
few
bottles
of
this
for
a
few
months
now
and
after
having
one
tonight
i
noticed
more
booziness
than
the
last
time
i
had
one
i
dont
know
if
just
a
few
months
is
enough
to
bring
out
characteristics
from
cellaring
it
but
it
was
for
sure
packed
more
of
a
punch
than
the
last
time
i
had
it
another
factor
was
that
right
before
i
drank
this
tonight
i
had
two
lesser
alcohol
beers
so
it
may
have
made
this
one
seem
more
boozy
the
7
8
abv
is
well
hidden
and
i
could
down
the
whole
4
pack
but
probably
not
a
good
move
d
this
is
a
little
more
tangy
than
a
typical
doppelbock
but
the
rest
of
the
regular
qualities
are
there
it
is
a
decent
brew
but
not
one
ill
seek
out
i
like
the
beer
but
one
is
enough
i
would
have
liked
a
tad
more
balance
here
need
a
little
more
hops
and
just
a
tad
less
malt
definitely
lighter
than
others
of
the
style
very
sweet
and
fruity
malt
aromas
overly
sweet
lots
of
apple
and
raisins
loads
of
sweet
caramel
malts
with
the
apple
and
raisin
present
here
as
well
strange
aftertaste
present
as
well
this
one
isnt
working
for
me
very
average
doppelbock
blonde
doppelbock
was
amber
in
color
with
some
fine
sediment
floating
about
it
had
an
offwhite
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
light
caramel
malt
the
taste
was
sweet
malt
upfront
a
little
toasty
and
a
bit
fruity
with
noticeable
alcohol
the
finish
was
dry
and
warming
it
was
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
drinkability
was
average
its
a
decent
doppelbock
but
not
one
that
i
will
likely
try
again
pours
a
golden
color
with
quite
a
bit
of
haze
and
a
thin
white
head
interesting
nose
with
grain
and
some
light
fruits
hints
of
alcohol
taste
is
light
fruit
and
grain
going
along
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
with
slight
booze
an
interesting
idea
but
not
all
that
good
highly
drinkable
the
great
flavor
wants
to
be
consumed
fast
but
one
of
those
to
be
watched
for
the
higher
abv
overall
never
had
anything
from
this
brewery
before
probably
because
i
live
in
wa
or
even
an
american
dopplebock
for
that
matter
but
i
must
say
this
was
a
very
good
one
so
ill
have
to
check
out
other
beers
from
this
brewery
if
i
see
them
around
here
for
a
strong
malty
smooth
lager
this
one
delivers
the
goods
all
in
all
very
drinkable
but
rather
different
than
i
remembered
i
thought
before
that
it
was
clearer
and
sweeter
maybe
just
a
defective
memory
this
is
perhaps
a
touch
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
it
is
a
nice
helles
doppelbock
that
i
am
definitely
enjoying
while
certainly
not
the
point
i
cant
help
but
feel
that
some
more
hop
character
would
make
this
a
touch
more
balanced
and
enjoyable
especially
as
this
beer
warms
up
it
starts
to
get
a
bit
too
sweet
d
a
little
hot
and
sweetness
gets
cloying
after
awhile
poured
from
bottle
generously
provided
by
kirby
color
is
a
clear
golden
honey
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
quickly
a
very
interesting
appearance
for
the
style
smell
is
banana
bread
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
yeast

no
trace
of
hops
flavor
follows
smell
bananas
up
front
some
bread
dough
and
a
hint
of

sweetness
light

and
mediumfull
body
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
i
could
not
drink
more
then
one
of
these
at
a
time
the
flavor
is
weak
and
flat
mildy
sweet
medium
bodied
not
a

in

mouth
finishes
nicely
though
its
just
mediocre
nothing
special
about
it
at
all
my
friend
d
kurtz
waited
8
yrs
to
find
this
beer
and
was
nice
or
drunk
enough
to
share
rich
copper
colored
beer
with
a
thick
white
head
sweet
honey
caramel

some
biscuity

is
very
sweet

biscuity

before
the
smooth
clean
noble

finish
creamy
texture
nice
complexity
d
this
beer
is
really
too
sweet
with
nothing
to
support
it
and
no
depth
to
the
sweetness
ive
had
several
capital
beers
and
was
really
looking
forward
to
the
blonde
doppelbock
this
beer
is
a
very
light
amber
shade
the
smell
is
very
sweet
you
can
detect
a
scent
of
caramel
the
taste
is
equally
as
sweet
i
found
the
7
8
abv
to
be
hidden
very
well
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
i
was
impressed
by
it
theres
not
a
lot
of
blonde
dopplebocks
of
which
to
compare
but
this
one
is
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
is
is
a
fine
comparison
to
imperial
pilsners

d
a

is
not
your
standard
style
and
hence
im
not

what
to
expect
all
in

this
was
an
okay
beer
but
not
one
that
blew
me

at

this
was
a
normally
good
bock
from
anoher
brewer
but
it
seemed
lackluster
in
comparison
after
having
this
nicely
done
d
another
great
germanstyle
beer
from
capital
no
surprise
here
i
enjoy
doppelbocks
quite
a
bit
but
i
must
say
that
this
one
let
me
down
nice
aroma
but
not
much
taste
to
back
it
up
maybe
i
got
a
skunky
bottle
d
very
good
beer
not
sure
of
the
price
point
for
quality
here
as
i
believe
it
was
close
to
3
504
00
for
one
of
these
good
but
not
as
good
as
some
other
brews
that
are
less
money
doppelbocks
are
not
among
my
favorite
styles
but
i
would
drink
this
again
points
for
being
exactly
what
it
advertises
a
blonde
doppelbock
light
color
leaves
a
not
as
malty
flavor
interesting
twist
on
a
dopplebock
i
felt
it
worked
but
the
alcohol
could
be
a
turnoff
for
some
d
youd
never
expect
this
to
be
7
8
alcohol
as
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
crisp
and
refreshing
light
and
easy
going
good
thing
they
are
sold
in
4packs
or
things
could
get
ugly
very
fast
the
taste
is
also
pretty
light
but
its
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
seems
alot
like
their
maibock
a
little
more
complex
d
too
drinkable
at
7
8
d
i
almost
feel
bad
that
i
dont
like
this
beer
more
but
i
wouldnt
drink
another
one
im
not
feeling
the
caramel
malt
in
this
one
i
can
taste
it
but
im
not
liking
it
the
drinkability
was
good
the
abv
was
a
little
high
but
that
was
more
than
balanced
by
the
flavor
a
nice
malty
but
with
balance
sweet
but
not
cloying
warming
sipper
hits
a

doppelbock
interpretation
well
d
a
decent
brew
but
not
one
that
is
a
stand
out
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
amber
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
form
a
cap
smells
of
sweet
malt
the
second
i
pop
the
twist
off
i
nudge
my
nose
a
bit
closer
and
find
lots
of
caramel
prunes
sweet
fruity
malts
and
melanoiden
taste
is
sweet
with
fruity
malts
and
caramel
i
pick
up
some
brown
sugar
and
cherries
in
there
as
well
finish
is
a
bit
sweet
with
a
bit
of
dryness
to
it
mouthfeel
is
sweet
and
sticky
carbonation
is
light
to
medium
body
is
medium
it
smells
a
lot
better
than
it
tastes
i
find
this
one
to
be
a
bit
too
sweet
for
its
own
good
if
there
were
a
little
bit
more
burnt
sugars
or
dark
fruits
in
there
to
counter
the
sweetness
this
would
be
pretty
damn
good
md
medium
bodied
with
a
somewhat
slick
feel
in
the
mouth
leaves
a
long
lasting
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
when
i
had
this
in
a
small
2
or
3oz
sample
size
at
a
festival
it
seemed
so
much
better
but
sitting
down
with
a
full
serving
it
was
not
as
ideal
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
really
all
that
good
either
particularly
as
a
result
of
the
fusels
and
alcohol
that
come
in
and
mar
the
whole
thing
clear
and
bright
orangeamber
with
a
thin
creamy
head
that
quickly
shrinks
to
a
bubbly
ring
sweet
fruity
aroma
caramel
spice
apple
and
honey
bready
malt
covered
with
a
slick
fruity
sweetness
not
overly
sweet
on
the
brighter
side
of
things
not
only
in
appearance
but
in
flavor
too
sweet
bread
honey
and
plum
mediumfull
creamy
body
a
little
sticky
pretty
good
stuff
nice
and
smooth
this
is
very
good
as
an
everyday
dopplebock
actually
if
i
had
regular
access
to
this
it
would
most
likely
become
a
staple
of
mine
all
in
all
very
nice
if
a
little
sweet
i
tend
to
like
beers
on
the
dry
hoppy
side
than
this
but
still
enjoyed
immensely
this
is
tasty
enough
but
its
very
one
dimensional
could
use
a
bit
of
hopping
to
balance
it
out
its
basically
a
malt
bomb
and
a
tasty
one
at
that
but
its
not
overly
interesting
id
still
be
glad
to
have
a
pint
or
two
on
occasion
however
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
and
good
tasting
malt
filled
beer
the
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overpowering
i
believe
it
is
just
above
average
for
the
style
i
would
have
a
couple
of
these
at
a
bar
but
not
session
them
pours
clear
copper
color
12
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good

and
good
lacing

alcohol
and
yeast

the
style
of
a
doppelbock

feel

smooth
and
slightly
thick
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
alcohol
sweet
malt
yeast
slight
roasted
malt
and
slight
hops
overall
a
rather
good
brew
nice
body
blend
and
drinkability
overall
i
would
have
to
say
i
enjoyed
the
autumnal
fire
more
than
this
beer
regardless
capital
needs
to
either
improve
their
year
round
lineup
or
lower
their
prices
on
their
beers
their
regular
year
round
lineup
is
no
cheaper
than
other
local
breweries
but
doesnt
seem
to
compare
aside
from
these
limited
release
beers
which
are
about
3
dollars
higher
per
six
pack
there
are
few
capital
beers
that
i
would
buy
aside
from
individual
bottles
3
54
a
good
effort
pretty
close
to
what
i
think
of
as
a
maibock
as
opposed
to
a
doppelbock
the
filming
is
a
bit
excessive
though
as
is
the
intrusiveness
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
yet
i
find
myself
sucking
it
down
pretty
quick
sessioning
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
full
on
session
beer
but
i
could
have
several
of
these
any
day
im
sure
id
feel
it
the
smell
comes
through
in
the
taste
rich
body
with
a
relatively
low
carbonation
level
nearly
no
hopon
the
sweet
side
even
for
the
style
not
crispround
like
an
ale
the
taste
while
excellent
loses
some
points
for
its
inability
to
stand
up
to
food
i
tried
this
a
with
a
bowl
of
chili
and
its
character
evaporated
when
faced
with
a
little
tabasco
sauce
id
expect
something
with
this
alcohol
content
to
be
able
to
hold
its
own
a
little
better
but
that
said
this
is
a
terrific
beer
on
its
own
and
id
highly
recommend
it

nice
amount
of
sharp
sweet
malts
that
leaves
a
nice
lingering
caramel
malt
taste
with
a
hint
of
sweet
fruits
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
boozy
presence
but
nothing
too
overbearing
an
intriguing
take
on
the
style
but
certainly
an
enjoyable
one
for
spring
you
get
used
to
it
after
a
few
sips
but
it
never
quite
comes
together
none
of
it
is
bad
really
but
when
you
combine
its
lack
of
balance
with
its
huge
intensity
its
really
not
that
good
ive
never
had
a
blonde
doppelbock
before
this
and
i
wasnt
expecting
much
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
subtle
beer
i
thought
this
one
was
pretty
good
though
i
definitely
prefer
a
darker
doppelbock
an
interesting
beer
though
worth
a
try
the
lighter
specialty
malt
bill
leads
to
a
sweet
bready
flavor
and
quite
noticeable
alcohol
presence
hops
are
detectable
as
well
with
the
light
body
and
moderately
high
carbonation
i
found
this
to
be
pretty
tasty
and
enjoyable
beer
i
would
be
happy
to
taste
some
more
from
this
brewery
drinkability
easier
drinking
doppelbock
than
most
great
spring
seasonal
good
stuff
drinkability
especially
high
an
amazingly
great
tasting
beer
with
a
very
moderate
abv
and
nice
clean
finish
d
the
website
warns
to
treat
this
malt
monster
with
respect
of
course
since
monsters
are
scary
and
dangerous
most
folks
steer
clear
of
their
path
i
however
am
a
certified
monster
slayer
and
i
must
say
that
this
deceptive
monsters
alcohol
is
exceptionally
well
hidden
for
being
damn
near
8
whatever
category
this
may
fall
into
i
could
go
for
another
one
pours
crystal
clear
golden
orange
with
a
1
finger
head
that
quickly
fades
with
no
lacing
down
the
glass
would
have
given
this
a
5
but
it
says
its
a
blonde
i
will
give
it
is
the
blondest
doppelbock
i
have
ever
seen
smell
is
all
bready
malts
and
fruits
taste
is
very
bready
malts
with
fruity
apple
and
pear
flavors
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
on
the
heavier
side
for
this
style
which
i
love
overall
capital
has
found
a
new
customer
i
will
be
looking
for
more
capital
brews
side
note
i
would
like
to
see
more
reasonable

id
love
to
drink
this
all

on

ill
be
good
and
keep
myself
to
just
a
couple
the
mouthfeel
is
somwhat
thick
with
a
bit
of
creamyness
from
carbonation
there
is
plenty
of
carbonation
in
this
without
that
stingy
bite
complexity
isnt
the
goal
here
and
many
other
reviewers
gave
misguided
reviews
of
this
beer
in
my
opinion
this
straightforward
malty
clean
bock
is
very
rewarding
and
hard
to
find
anything
in
the
u
s
that
comes
close
in
this
style
a
very
enjoyable
take
on
the
dopplebock
its
nice
to
see
a
brewer
push
the
style
envelope
even
if
ever
so
slightly
nice

with
a

palate
following
and
the
mild
citrus
and
caramel
linger
into
the

robust
and
flavorful
this
is
a
pleasure
to

would

like

a

capital
continues
to
prove
theyve
mastered
the
art
of

lagers
my
good

buddy
is
moving

madison
very
soon
ill
definitely
be
visiting
him
often
d
this
one
is
very
easy
to
drink
a
great
summer
beer
that
begs
to
be
taken
to
a
bbq
pick
this
one
up
if
you
havnt
already
tried
it
capital
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
american
breweries
the
blond
doppelbock
was
an
interesting
beer
it
poured
a
light
amber
color
with
an
nice
white
head
and
decent
lacing
smell
was
sweet
and
malty
the
taste
matched
the
smell
sweet
malty
and
hints
of
caramel
had
the
slightest
hop
finish
mouthfeel
was
good
a
little
syrupy
but
not
bad
overall
this
was
nice
and
sweet
doppelbock
a
change
of
pace
from
other
doppels
it
was
very
nice
overall
i
was
a
bit
shocked
and
let
down
by
this
one
i
have
had
good
luck
with
capital
so
far
and
this
was
the
first
one
that
threw
me
nothing
that
would
keep
me
from
trying
them
again
in
the
future
but
it
does
make
me
take
pause
oh
well
on
to
the
next
one
pours
a
hazy
higly
carbonated
soft
orangelight
copper
no
head
even
with
a
medium
pour
thats
just
slightly
softer
than
a
hard
pour
by
the
way
smells
malty
kind
of
sweet
like
an
ice
cream
cone
nuttiness
and
toffee
dominate
the
initial
taste
zesty
hops
pick
up
from
there
slight
vanilla
in
the
initial
taste
nice
mouth
feel
to
it
this
beer
really
grew
on
me
as
i
worked
my
way
through
it
well
put
together
pretty
much
the
same
beer
from
the
bottle
as
on
tap
httpbeeradvocate
combeerprofile3682963bapimpp
the
smell
is
the
biggest
downfall
of
this
brew
but
id
say
it
makes
up
for
it
in
drinkability
under
7
for
a
doppelbock
is
very
nice
this
drinks
well
maybe
too
well
as
it
could
catch
up
on
a
guy
if
not
careful
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
stealth
sessionable
d
this
can
be
booth
a
sipping
beer
and
have
a
bunch
beer
very
enjoyable
and
will
def
buy
more
this
beer
was
ok
but
very
unimpressed
this
was
my
first
foray
into
socalled
blonde
doppelbocks
and
it
disappointed
me
way
too
sweet
for
my
taste
no
carbonation
no
lacing
no
head
off
tap
could
have
been
betteror
at
least
not
labeled
as
a
doppel
its
very
agreeable
and
seems
to
be
a
good
introductory
germanstyle
beer
in
general
very
nice
another
good
beer
from
capital
drinkability
6
9
its
not
sessionable
at
least
not
for
me
but
to
enjoy
seasonally
a
couple
times
it
isnt
to
shabby
a
bit
more
filling
that
your
average
beer
i
bought
this
as
a
single
from
3
cellars
in
franklin
wi
thickness
is
moderate
to
high
which
is
totally
appropriate
here
a
tad
slick
although
the
carbonation
helps
smooth
that
over
abv
is
totally
under
control
and
if
i
needed
a
big
ol
malt
fix
this
would
be
a
fun
change
of
pace
from
a
traditional
doppel
really
this
is
more
of
a
freakedout
marzenmaibock
marriage
in
my
book
d
pretty
damn
good
no
wonder
he
has
a
fest
to
celebrate
this
delicious
beer
that
would
be
a
really
good
food
pairing
beer
which
would
go
well
with
a
lot
of
different
foods
a
little
thin
for
a
dopple
but
a
very
tasty
beer
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
despite
not
knowing
the
style
very
well
pretty
good
and
a
fantastic
transitional
beer
for
a
macro
drinker
needs
more
depth
though
for
my
palate
and
i
love
a
good
lager
especially
american
made
ones
my
guess
on
abv
was
78
so
i
was
a
little
high
but
this
one
does
have
some
heat
to
it
it
seems
to
lack
the
complexity
of
a
dark
dopplebock
but
it
is
easier
to
drink
and
a
bit
more
bitter
as
well
not
bad
at
all
i
would
be
happy
to
have
again
this
one
pours
quite
a
light
amber
into
my
imp
pint
head
gets
huge
on
a
vigorous
pour
but
settles
right
down
aroma
is
hoppy
with
a
light
malty
undertone
taste
follows
that
as
the
hops
stands
out
on
top
of
the
rich
malty
presence
this
one
is
a
nice
change
for
a
dopplebock
for
sure
easily
drinkable
yet
enough
flavor
and
aroma
to
thoroughly
enjoy
cheers
this
was
my
first
blonde
doppelbock
and
i
really
liked
it
great
bock
flavor
but
lighter
and
very
drinkable
drinkability
is
decent
but
nothing
special
the
malt
and
alcohol
levels
bring
it
down
but
any
seasoned
drinker
will
find
their
palates
begging
for
a
second
bottle
cheers
finish
picks
up
just
a
bit
but
the
lingering
harshness
of
a
house
yeast
strain
of
where
this
is
contract
bottled
is
a
bit
tough
im
not
quite
sure
what
style
i
should
be
comparing
this
to
i
wish
i
picked
up
their
maibock
i
figured
id
try
it
on
tap
but
didnt
get
around
to
it
always
a
good
brew
but
the
early
versions
were
much
better
poured
with
a
nice
head
that
subsided
into
a
light
cover
and
a
little
lace
color
is
a
lovely
deep
amber
aroma
is
a
bit
boozy
sweet
and
malty
flavor
is
huge
caramel
malt
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
good
carbonation
likewise
good
mouth
pleasant
finish
could
drink
a
few
but
not
many
this
beer
pours
a
clear
red
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
with
a
hint
of
grapefruit
the
taste
is
maltier
than
the
aroma
with
a
nice
lasting
caramel
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
i
dont
really
get
this
beer
it
seems
more
like
an
amber
lager
than
a
doppelbock
it
isnt
bad
but
it
isnt
good
enough
that
i
would
buy
it
again
pours
an
orangey
amber
with
a
one
finger
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
sugary
malts
and
some
yeast
taste
is
honey
camel
bananas
apples
and
cotton
candy
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
incredibly
drinkable
perfect
compliment
to
a
beautiful
spring
day
drinkability
is
average
unless
you
really
enjoy
the
flavor
and
alcoholic
burn
i
do
i
really
really
do
at
only
6
9
its
not
masked
at
all
and
yet
i
have
had
on
occasion
a
6
pack
and
always
felt
it
in
the
morning
i
wonder
if
its
still
only
6
9
after
all
these
years
drinkability
pretty
tasty
craft
brew
thanks
joe
very
drinkable
for
such
a
rich
and
almost
sweet
malty
brew
could
even
be
slowly
sessioned
another
capital
brew
that
i
can
only
describe
as
an
enjoyable
treat
an
approachable
straightforward
and
tasty
brew
will
be
keeping
my
eys
open
for
this
in
the
future
carbonation
is
extremely
light
but
just
noticeable
enough
to
be
apparent
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
were
it
on
shelves
in

soft

some
warming
alcohol
is

on
the

not
much
by
way
of
hops
on
the
nose
but
theyre
here
alright
tastes
brighter
dumb
word
choice
i
know
or
at
least
livelier
than
many
a
dark
doppelbock
i
can
think
of
but
would
easily
strike
you
average
everydaydrinker
of
light
lagers
as
a
socalled
dark
beer
if
it
were
offered
to
him
or
her

light

notes
start
this
one
out
and
fairly
linger
throughout

of
some

and
a

of
crystal
malt
for
sweetness
light
hints
of
molasses
as
with
a
few
other
doppelbocks
i
could
mention
this
one
is
on
the
fruity
side
for
a
lager
and
this
is
to
its
credit
honey
notes
in
the
aromatics
and
the
barest
hint
of
candi
sugar
keep
you
guessing
at
this
one
ale
or
lager
almost
meadlike
in
character
with
a
firm
medium
body
slightly
thickslightly
creamy
mouthfeel
and
excellent
drinkability
this
is
just
an
excellent
brew
plain
and
simple
and
its
worth
whatever
the
good
folks
at
capital
feel
they
should
get
for
it
this
one
and
the
bells
cherry
stout
are
on

kegs

own
my

blonde
doppelbock
isnt
the
beer
that
id
hoped
it
would
be
this
brewery
appears
to
take
pride
in
their
bocks
since
they
brew
six
of
them
at
various
times
of
the
year
even
though
this
one
falls
well
short
of
expectations
im
still
excited
about
trying
the
four
capital
bocks
that
i
havent
yet
had
i
just
hope
theyre
better
than
the
beer
i
just
finished
drinkability

this
is
a
fairly
stiff
db
because
of

it

watch
out

and
myself
66
in
the

its
a
little
more
amber
than
i
would
think
of
for
a
blond
the
nose
is
all
grain
and
malt
very
pleasant
it
has
a
sweet
malty
taste
with
a
crisp
clean
finish
that
leaves
the
mouth
as
a
sparkle
of
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
for
this
beer
is
very
appropriate
for
the
style
its
clean
crisp
and
not
overbearing
a
nice
drinker
with
a
well
disguised

in
many
ways
this
is
the
jewel
in

little
hint
of

in
the

i
founds
this
to
be
almost
cloyingly
sweet
nice
malt

fruit
notes
were
suffocated
by
the
syrupy

of
this
brew

dopplebock
well
i
was
completely
taken
by
surpise
by
this
beer
it
was
nothing
like
i
thought
it
would
be
i
would
have
preferred
the
head
to
remain
pillowing
thru
the
begining
to
end
of
the
beer
but
only
a
few
brewers
can
pull
that
off
not
complex
but
doppels
rarely
are
this
was
a
good
beer
i
enjoyed
drinking
and
reviewing
it
and
i
still
taste
honey
in
my
mouth
drinkability
this
goes
down
fairly
easy
but
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
to
have
more
than
two
in
a
session
i
would
have
this
again
just
not
often
truly
exceptional
and
very
fresh

in

loaded
with
banana
coconut
rum
and
granny

my

be
turned
on
by
the
fire
but
instead
i
feel
drawn
to
it
did
i
mention
that
its
a
pretty
clear
orange
color
with
wild
crazy
bubbles
but
no
head
mmm
capital
really
gets
bocks
right
this
review
is
based
on
several
liters
enjoyed
at
capital
brewerys
annual
bockfest
the
freshest
way
to
enjoy
a
blonde
doppelbock
this
beer
pours
out
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
with
a
large
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
quite
malty
with
a
bit
of
fruitiness
alcohol
is
noticable
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
very
malty
with
notes
of
apples
and
coconut
this
is
not
what
you
think
of
as
your
standard
dopplebock
although
it
is
malty
it
is
not
dark
it
is
however
refreshing
and
delicious
it
is
also
drinkable
in
large
quantities
try
it
on
tap
and
you
will
see
what
an
exceptional
beer
this
is
got
this
in
a
trade
and
i
cannot
find
my
trading
papers
so
thanks
to
the
one
that
sent
this
poured
a
golden
with
a
small
white
head
that
didnt
last
long
aroma
sweet
orange
malt
some
alcohol
flavor
got
caramel
malts
the
orange
a
hint
of
honey
with
a
slight
amount
of
alcohol
not
to
bad
but
i
was
a
little
surprised
to
see
a
dopplebock
this
light
in
color
pours
a
mostly
clear
golden
amber
head
is
decent
at
first
and
slowly
fades
to
a
thin
collar
aroma
is
mostly
toasted
toffeeish
malt
with
a
hint
of
spices
flavors
are
a
bold
spicy
taste
mixed
with
a
bit
of
sweet
fruits
the
smooth
munich
malts
blend
really
well
with
the
other
flavors
and
they
compliment
each
other
quite
well
mouthfeel
is
oily
but
finishes
very
clean
and
urges
you
to
take
another
drink
after
each
sip
a
good
offering
from
capital
brewery
drinkability
is
ok
i
wouldnt
bother
with
it
again
though
i
think
i
just
prefer
doppelbocks
on
the
dark
side
pours
an
orangeyellow
color
with
almost
no
head
that
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
grainy
and
has
some
toasted
malts
the
flavor
is
malty
and
has
an
interesting
toasted
maltiness
its
ok
but
the
flavor
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
the
drinkability
is
ok
pours
a
solid
orange
color
with
a
striking
lack
of
head
nose
is
full
of
toasty
melanoidans
and
nice
figgy
notes
very
appealing
nose
flavor
is
solid
toasted
maltyness
good
bit
of
vienna
and
munich
malt
light
figgy
character
but
mostly
melanoidan
feel
is
moderate
with
a
light
to
moderate
carbonation
overall
nothing
really
makes
this
one
stand
out
to
me
the
flavors
are
just
not
turning
me
on
all
that
much
its
okay
but
i
dont
think
i
would
have
it
again
another
good
one
from
capital
i
kind
of
ignored
these
guys
when
i
first
got
here
due
to
new
glarus
lake
louie
and
tyranena
but
they
have
some
nice
offerings
ive
had
quite
a
few
dopplebocks
lately
and
i
must
say
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
pours
a
cloudy
ambergolden
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
quickly
smell
is
citrusy
and
floral
with
a
nice
malt
kick
taste
starts
off
with
that
strong
malt
backbone
and
adds
in
the
nice
hoppy
citrusfloral
notes
to
balance
it
off
nicely
mouthfeel
is
on
the
crisp
side
but
not
as
biting
as
some
dopples
ive
had
this
is
a
tastyass
brew
right
here
extremely
drinkable
for
6
9
probably
my
favorite
capital
brew
to
date
my
first
doppelbock
very
blonde
orangecolored
almost
no
head
or
lacing
smells
sweet
with
a
big
kick
of
spicy
hops
tastes
really
really
really
good
a
revelation
for
me
in
the
way
its
quite
hoppy
but
still
extremely
smooth
my
experience
with
capital
has
been
that
they
make
solid
faithful
unexceptional
representations
of
styles
and
since
this
is
my
first
for
this
particular
style
i
cant
comment
on
that
aspect
however
i
can
say
that
its
a
damn
tasty
beer
i
have
not
much
experiece
w
this
style
but
this
offering
is
impressing
the
hell
out
of
me
so
quaffable
its
ridiculous
yum
golden
to
copper
in
color
with
a
lacey
white
head
light
caramel
malt
and
spicey
yeast
fill
the
nose
flavor
is
so
clean
malty
pilsen
and
caramel
just
a
light
hint
of
toast
in
the
finish
hop
character
is
very
subdued
just
adding
some
bitterness
the
yeast
is
spicey
a
just
noticable
ester
that
ive
really
come
to
look
forward
to
in
the
capital
bocks
this
beer
is
smooth
and
totally
hides
the
alcohol
with
its
sweet
malt
charater
another
great
lager
from
capital
this
beer
is
a
dark
gold
color
with
a
small
cream
colored
head
some
carbonation
the
scent
is
pale
malts
sweetness
the
taste
is
the
same
sweet

matls
floral
hop
tones
bits
of
fruit
some
more

beer

enjoy

the
springtime

looking
clear

color
with
about
12
of
creamy
offwhite
foam
smell
is
very
malty
with
some
brown
sugar
and
a
little
alcohol
present
taste
is
very
full
and
rich
this
reminds
me
in
many
ways
of
a
maibock
the
alcohol
adds
a
little
spiciness
while
hops
may
be
hidden
somewhere
in
there
i
cant
find
them
a
nice
big
alcohol
and
malt
beer
for
the
cold
days
easy
drinkin
the
flavor
balances
sweet
malts
with
alcohol
but
alcoholic
heat
is
relatively
mild
for
a
dopplebock
a
fullbodied
beer
this
coats
well
with
an
exceptionally
clean
and
smooth
finish

we
both
ended
up
with
12
heads

offwhite
thick
head
it
left
in
a
hurry
so
i
am
concentrating
on
the
aroma
first
impresion
it
smells
like
beer
second
one
when
you
take
some
big
whiffs
off
the
glass
you
encounter
good
german
maltinessgraininess
and
also
alcohol
struggling
to
get
through
mouthfeel
is
full
and
ive
head
this
beer
for
about
30
minutes
by
now
so
it
has
warmed
up
a
bit
it
was
a
bit
tastier
about
15
minutes
ago
i
think
the
alcohol
has
intensified
and
its
the
first
thing
i
encounter
now
theres
some
malty
sweetness
but
the
alcohol
definitely
appears
again
in
the
finish
word
to
wise
drink
it
before
it
gets
too
warm
before
it
did
i
thought
it
was
pretty
thick
malt
with
some
hops
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
easily
consumed
and
is
also
eager

pour
for
a
dopplebock
hence
the
title
blonde
dopplebock
i
suppose
a
rich
looking
amber
pour
with
minimal
head
the
nose
was
semi
sweet
with
a
wallop
of
molasses
and
some
noticeable
maltiness
the
body
was
much
bigger
with
an
almost
chewy
toffee
quality
again
the
molasses
and
roasted
malt
were
present
as
well
as
some
lolipop
sweetness
a
very
warming
beer
with
an
obvious
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
a
full
bodied
beer
with
plenty
of
backbone
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
drinkability
very
good
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
in
a
12l
glass
yum
thanks
again
to
zap
for
digging
into
his
stash
of
beloved
bocks
i
suppose
i
could
be
overexaggerating
its
subtlties
but
who
cares
this
is
good
drinkability
is
very
high
and
at
relatively
high
abv
this
would
definitely
cause
me
to
leave
the
car
keys
in
the
pcoket

call

some

noted
too
the
taste
is
heavy

keep
it

the

another
good
example
by
this
brewery
not
as
light

as
the
title
implies
just
a
little
lighter
than
salvator
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
slightly
noticeable
but
not
overwhelming
by
any
means
somewhat
sweet
but
drinkability
remains
good
i
had
this
before
a
salvator
and
it
was
not
outclassed
i
liked
their
autumnal
fire
even
better

this
is
a
pretty

dissapeared

immediately

a
hint
of

a
bit
of
a

thing
going
on
flavor
is
a
rich
malty
sweet
one
and
a
bit
dry
on
the
finish
has
that
distinct
german
bock
aroma
and
flavor
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
id
drink
often
either
this
brew
pours
a
small
head
of
fine
white
bubbles
and
a
transparent
light
orange
brown
body
it
had
a
mild
malt
aroma
this
brew
had
a
smooth
initial
flavor
and
no
fore
or
after
bite
i
did
not
understand
this
brew
and
i
would
definately
not
call
it
a
doppelbock
if
youre
craving
a
beer
from
wisconsin
this
had
better
be
the
one
well
be
screening
any
excuses
for
other
options
but
its
a
strict
judge
and
jury
really
this
is
the
stuff
first
of
all
i
have
never
seen
such
a
light
colored
dopplebock
nor
have
i
ever
rated
such
a
light
colored
dopplebock
since
ive
been
rating
beers
that
said
this
brew
had
a
small
white
head
with
small
bubbles
that
fully
diminished
the
lacing
was
fair
and
the
body
was
clear
with
an
orange
hue
it
had
a
light
malty
aroma
and
a
hoppy
aroma
of
citrus
there
was
no
carbonation
observed
with
this
brew
it
was
bitter
tasting
from
start
to
finish
and
lingered
for
a
while
after
finishing
this
drink
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
light
and
somewhat
watery
poured
to
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
tan
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
toasty
as
well
the
flavor
was
great
with
that
big
toasty
bready
malt
flavor
and
as
well
as
some
caramel
sweetness
this
is
a
big
fullbodied
brew
that
is
highly
drinkable
i
really
like
the
big
malty
brew
this
one
did
it
for
me
i
will
definitely
sample

doesnt
seem
as
heavy
as
the
dark
doppelbock
that
they
produce
a

example
of
the
style
and
something
to
look
forward
to
in
the
spring
tastes
of
sweet

are
the

that
grows
also

not
an

the
top
pressence
a
great
beer
i
have
never
had
a
blonde
doppelbock
or
really
that
many
doppelbocks
before
but
i
like
this
one
its
brilliant
amber
robe
takes
on
a
crimson
cast
when
set
upon
the
bar
and
the
frothy
white
head
seems
to
last
forever
it
continually
retains
a
thin
creamy
cap
and
leaves
some
very
nice
lace
throughout
the
glass
the
body
is
mediumfull
and
its
smooth
and
creamy
across
the
palate
fresh
and
clean
gently
toasted
malt
is
present
in
the
nose
and
then
again
in
the
flavor
its
not
a
complex
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
it
is
surprisingly
rich
and
satisfying
the
clean
pure
flavor
of
munich
malt
is
nicely
balanced
by
an
underlying
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
drying
alcohol
that
lends
toward
a
note
of
apple
mild
honeyishvanilla
and
caramel
evolve
as
it
warms
backed
by
some
very
low
level
hop
flavor
and
the
finish
is
long
lasting
with
residual
nutty
malt
and
a
wash
of
drying
alcohol
its
an
interesting
doppelbock
in
that
its
very
cleancut
and
straightforward
yet
satisfying
it
doesnt
have
the
depth
of
many
darker
versions
but
its
impelling
certainly
worth
trying

o
as

addict
i
am
a
fan
of
this
beer
the
blend
of
doppelbock
and
oktoberfest
works
well
to
create
a
fullflavored
complex
profile
that
is
refreshingly
devoid
of
any
noticeable
hop
presence
i
see
myself
picking
this
up
annually
during
trips
to
chitown
and
enjoying
it
every
time
i
restrained
myself
as
my
neighbor
knocked
over
the
last
one
i
had
brought
with
me
from
wi
neither
a
tear
or
neighbor
dropped
to
my
deck
as
much
as
both
should
have
the
only
plus
is
that
my
deck
boards
never
smelled
so
good
best
beer
ever
perfect
in
everyway
o
looks
like
a
year
really
set
this
one
straight
a
great
sipper
the
bourbon
really
makes
this
one
a
solid
brew
a
clear
amber
orange
in
color
with
a
medium
tan
head
solvent
alcohol
and
brown
sugar
in
the
aroma
after
that
is
some
sweet
toffee
flavor
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
rich
mouth
feel
velvety
smooth
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
dopplebock
beautiful
auburn
colored
body
was
clear
and
the
beer
displayed
little
carbonation
and
formed
no
head
the
smell
was
a
mixture
of
sour
dark
skinned
fruits
caramel
cocoa
and
coffee
the
taste
was
very
fruity
brimming
with
flavors
of
cherries
and
fig
as
well
as
showing
off
some
vanilla
toffee
and
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
body
was
thicker
than
medium
dense
with
sticky
initial
feel
and
a
dry
finish
i
believe
this
is
the
first
beer
from
this
brewery
ive
sampled
it
probably
wont
be
the
last
based
on
the
quality
of
this
one
serving
type
a
12oz
bottle
and
poured
into
a
capital
brewery
snifter
o
this
isnt
a
style
i
would
normally
reach
for
but
it
is
quite
good
and
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
german
style
beers
even
though
the
doppelbock
was
a
little
on
the
odd
side
it
was
still
pretty
good
i
have
had
worse
doppelbocks
than
this
i
still
wish
the
roasted
malts
were
allowed
to
shine
more
and
that
the
caramel
wasnt
replaced
by
fruits
in
the
taste
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
i
would
im
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
doppelbock
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
doppelbock
for
some
time
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
a
brownish
red
color
with
virtually
no
head
the
beer
showed
appropriate
retention
and
lacing
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
the
aroma
as
it
was
more
faint
than
anticipated
sweet
malts
dominated
the
aroma
in
the
initial
taste
one
tastes
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
like
a
sweet
bread
a
sour
note
hits
the
side
of
the
tongue
while
darker
fruits
dance
in
the
background
there
is
a
hint
of
carbonation
in
the
background
molasses
and
dark
chocolate
develop
as
the
initial
taste
matures
in
the
aftertaste
the
taste
sours
while
coating
the
back
of
the
throat
nicely
a
slight
warming
sensation
can
be
detected
capital
does
doppelbocks
exceptionally
well
reddishcopper
with
a
cream
coloured
head
decent
clarity
in
the
body
good
retention
and
lacing
nose
of
toasty
grains
dark
fruits
sweet
malts
and
some
caramel
apple
taste
has
more
sweet
toasty
grains
caramels
some
fruity
malt
character
and
a
bit
of
bread
a
tad
sweet
in
the
finish
no
sense
of
the
abv
and
this
is
smooth
as
heck
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
ive
come
across
if
you
know
a
bier
geek
who
cant
appreciate
lagers
have
them
try
this
i
know
capital
doesnt
get
much
respect
in
the
bier
geek
circles
but
damn
can
they
make
a
lager
i
pity
anyone
whose
palate
cannot
appreciate
something
as
fine
as
this
i
love
hops
as
much
as
the
next
guy
but
masterful
wisconsin
lagers
are
a
thing
of
beauty
review
from
notes
autumnal
fire
pours
a
dark
clear
amber
color
with
a
very
small
white
head
there
is
a
strong
malty
aroma
with
an
oktoberfest
like
spices
the
taste
has
a
strong
malty
taste
almost
vinegary
a
nice
hint
of
spices
has
a
warm
taste
good
full
taste
nice
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
very
good
doppelbock
somewhat
different
has
a
nice
spice
note
would
i
buy
it
again
no
overall
dopplebock
is
not
really
my
style
but
this
was
pretty
good
i
think
capital
has
better
beer
but
i
would
drink
this
again
o
dopplebocks
arent
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
was
pretty
decent
nothing
amazing
but
easy
to
drink
and
fairly
enjoyable
in
my
opinion
not
as
good
as
the
ratings
suggest
but
id
recommend
trying
it
out
smells
and
tastes
of
toasted
bread
and
sweet
chestnuts
with
hearty
sticky
toffee
molasses
caramelcovered
apples
sprinkled
with
crushed
walnuts
and
a
dab
of
tobacco
light
leafy
herbal
hopping
on
the
finish
its
easy
to
see
why
this
one
has
garnered
quite
the
positive
reputation
sweet
without
being
cloying
higher
abv
than
typical
without
much
hotness
good
balance
between
bread
dough
and
caramel
sauce
ive
heard
this
beer
likened
to
an
oktoberfest
style
beer
and
i
understand
why
with
the
similarities
of
malts
and
european
hops
not
your
average
beer
however
what
an
easy
drinker
ive
been
waiting
for
it
to
warm
somewhat
but
it
disappears
at
an
alarming
rate
ive
been
wanting
to
try
some
of
capitals
beers
for
some
time
and
now
i
know
they
have
quality
brews
o
just
a
great
balance
of
malts
and
sweet
nice
work
capital
the
beer
is
dark
orange
to
brown
in
color
appearing
hazy
and
sporting
a
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
offers
toffee
malt
bread
butterscotch
some
sweet
fruits
really
nice
and
easy
drinking
exceptionally
smooth
feel
very
light
in
body
and
creamy
on
the
palate
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
overall
this
is
hands
down
one
of
the
best
doppelbockstyle
beers
i
have
had
yet
it
tastes
wonderful
it
has
a
great
aroma
and
it
feels
crisp
on
the
palette
ooverall
this
beer
was
very
nice
to
drink
i
highly
suggest
this
beer
im
glad
i
found
it
in
the
fridge
at
my
local
cigar
shop
we
cant
even
get
this
where
i
live
here
in
south
texas
so
i
was
excited
to
see
this
beer
there
was
a
whole
case
of
it
and
its
fresh
too
i
dont
even
know
how
brought
this
down
here
but
thanks
to
whoever
you
are
and
cheers
everyone
summary
i
wouldnt
let
this
age
more
than
a
year
o
a
great
doppelbock
that
avoids
the
sweetness
trap
and
provides
a
nice
sweetmalty
punch
big
bold
flavors
with
a
crisp
clean
lager
finish
this
beer
never
fails
to
impress
me
o
definately
in
my
top
five
im
a
sconnie
and
a
malthead
so
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
eisphyre
is
almost
like
drinking
straight
out
of
my
mash
tun
so
that
beats
out
af
by
a
bit
for
me
but
i
hoard
this
beer
kirby

this
is
my
kind

up
maibock
makes
me
contemplative
and
even
prayerful
dear
lord
i
realize
first
impressions
are
sometimes
overly
promising
but
please
allow
autumnal
fire
to
remain
the
same
today
tomorrow
and
always
amen
pours
mostly
opaque
amber
and
red
although
presents
with
a
spectrum
from
deep
amber
to
yellow
at
the
edges
head
is
off
whitegreyish
with
super
fine
bubbles
nice
retention
and

smells
very
yeasty
sweet
caramely
malt
raisin
and
some
notes
of
honey
and
sherry
taste
is
mild
caramel
malt
raisin
finishing
with
some
breadinessgraininess
and
slightly
off
dry
some
indication
of
a
little
oxidation
mild
carbonation
lightish
body
pretty
smooth
no
alcohol
noticeable
overall
quite
drinkable
and
an
interesting
interpretation
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
this
fresh
so
i
cant
comment
on
what
the
aging
has
accomplished
but
based
on
other
reviews
aging
appears
to
have
mellowed
out
the
sharp
edges
do
this
traditional
americanbrewed
doppelbock
and
its
siblings
seem
to
be
madisons
capital
brewerys
claim
to
fameand
with
good
reason
it
seems
to
have
no
sharp
edges
whatsoever
once
it
gets
past
the
nose
and
enters
the
mouth
flavors
are
masterfully
tame
without
being
boring
with
none
of
the
angst
and
urgency
present
in
the
smell
although
a
little
insubstantial
for
the
style
the
texture
is
still
pleasurably
smooth
it
begs
to
be
paired
with
slowcooked
winter
meals
and
roasted
anything
but
is
kind
enough
to
the
palate
to
be
enjoyed
on
its
own
pours
a
hazy
dark
burnt
orange
with
small
offwhite
head
that
disappates
quickly
the
aroma
is
rich
and
malty
with
caramel
foremost
some
breadinessearthiness
the
flavor
is
smooth
deep
malt
with
raisin
and
toffee
character
and
dark
toast
there
are
just
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
licorice
the
finish
is
a
little
bit
boozy
and
leaves
a
sticky
aftertaste
look
im
not
a
big
fan
of
doppelbocks
so
take
this
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
ive
never
been
a
big
fan
of
capitals
stuff
either
they
make
a
ton
of
brews
but
none
of
them
memorable
for
me
in
a
go
out
and
get
it
kind
of
way
o
overall
i
had
a
hard
time
focusing
on
any
one
flavor
in
this
beer
it
really
has
a
lot
going
on
id
probably
look
forward
to
autumn
if
i
lived
in
wisconsin
because
this
is
really
tasty
overall
the
flavors
of
a
dopplebock
are
there
certainly
but
it
just
isnt
as
pronounced
or
last
as
long
as
it
should
this
also
leads
to
problems
with
the
mouth
feel
which
is
unfortunate
capital
brewery
is
awfully
close
to
a
good
doppelbock
but
this
just
isnt
quite
there
o
very
tasty
beer
mix
of
roasted
malts
and
sweet
malts
make
for
a
great
taste
overall
a
very
good
dopplebock
the
flavors
are
sweet
and
the
beer
is
very
smooth
i
think
this
compares
very
well
with
some
of
the
german
dopplebocks
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
it
lacks
as
far
as
a
doppelbock
goes
i
want
a
lot
more
dark
roasted
malts
in
my
doppelbocks
but
it
is
still
tasty
regardless
i
would
classify
this
as
an
imperial
oktoberfest
or
a
strong
plain
bock
as
the
toasted
and
sweet
bready
malts
really
dominate
all
facets
of
this
beer
definitely
a
nice
style
to
enjoy
this
time
of
year
and
i
would
definitely
prefer
this
to
other
blander
oktoberfest
styles
but
that
is
to
be
expected
with
the
higher
abv
and
presumably
highermore
complex
malt
bill
definitely
worth
a
go
if
it
is
readily
available
to
you
but
you
do
not
need
to
seek
this
one
out
d
a
good
autumn
brew
lots
of
malt
this
didnt
measure
up
to
my
hopes
the
taste
has
something
weird
going
on
that
i
dont
like
and
the
mouthfeel
is
too
light
and
dry
its
very
possible
that
this
beer
has
suffered
since
bottling
ill
try
this
years
batch
much
fresher
as
soon
as
it
comes
out
and
revise
my
review
as
needed

and
2012
autumnal
fire
side
by
side
taking
small
sips
of
each
as
i
went
the
2008
was
simply
outstanding
their
was
a
strong
taste
and
smell
of
dark
fruits
as
the
beer
tasted
much
sweeter
than
a
fresh
bottle
it
reminded
me
more
of
a
barleywine
than
a
dopplebock
the
2011
had
some
of
these
characteristics
but
not
as
much
as
the
older
bottle
i
now
need
to
1
find
another
bottle
of
2008
hopefully
at
rileys

of

here
in

was

raise
my
score
for

i

if
a
beer
tastes
better

it
should
rank
a
little
higher
than
those
that
dont
age
well
overall
a
couple
of
these
and
you

this

and
for
you
brother
you
gifted
this
to
me
right
before
i
got
bound
up
in

and
forgot
about
it
i
remember
having
some
at
capital
during
ale
street
news
inaugural
visit

it
was
nowhere
as
memorable
as
it
was

this

poured

as

semi
thick
looking
orange
amber
color
the
head
was
decent
but
didnt
really
have
much
in
way
of
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
good
amount
of
malts
on
the
nose
and
just
a
bit
of
spice
the
taste
has
a
pretty
good
bite
to
it
its
a
little
hoppier
than
i
expected
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
heavy
and
a
little
oily
overall
its
a
pretty
good
brew

the

pours
a
slightly
hazy
reddishamber
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
that
went
away
quickly
there
isnt
much

left

is
toasted

brown

toffee
and
a
bit
of
dark

taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
but
theres
some
butterscotch
noticable
too
its
a
good
malty
brew

is
medium
its
a

creamy
with

i
think
its
a
decent
brew
its
not
my
favorite
doppelbock
but
id
try
this
one
again
in
the
future
its
definitely
worth
a
try
its
good
and
worth
a
try
but
not
my
favorite
doppelbock
o
this
beer
is
great
fresh
even
better
after
about
6
months
cant
wait
to
try
this
with
a
year
on
it

with

dark

yum
tastes
sweet
brown
sugar
caramel
breadiness
dark
fruit
but
not
in
an
over
the
top
manner
very
easy
drinker
despite
the
abv
very
good
mouthfeel
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
doppelbock
and
the
flagship
beer
of
capital
brewery
d
good
but
not
great
easily
drinkable
and
something
i
would
get
again
but
its
not
on
the
top
of
my
list
highly
drinkable
straightforward
beer
medium
bodied
overall
this
was
alright
not
something
id
go
back
to
but
pretty
good
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
dopplebock
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary
or
noteworthy
but
just
an
excellent
example
of
a
dopplebock
with
a
brilliant
malt
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
i
really
like
this
beer
a
lot
it
showcases
the
malty
flavors
very
well
and
its
a
very
good
version
of
the
style
very
nice
beer
overall
this
was
certainly
a
very
solid
doppelbock
but
didnt
quite
blow
me
away
as
some
of
the
talk
on
this
beer
might
have
had
me
believe
it
definitely
has
a
decent
depth
of
flavora
here
though
with
a
clean
body
and
it
absolutely
drinks
well
for
its
hefty
size
i
would
recommend
this
a
well
crafted
american
take
on
the
style
seek
this
beer
out
the
drinkability
isnt
too
bad
but
the
richness
and
almost
8
alcohol
definitely
mean
its
a
sipper
do
for
me
this
seems
like
it
has
a
higher
abv
than
7
8
and
because
of
that
id
have
to
ding
the
drinkability
factor
a
tad
overall
a
good
beer
pours
a
amber
copper
color
with
a
smallish
head
and
a
light
tan
collar
smell
is
maltstoffee
and
candied
floral
hops
taste
is
spices
like
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
mixed
with
brown
sugarthen
throw
in
some
caramel
baked
breadand
earth
peat
hops
its
tasty
like
a
winter
warmer
mouth
feel
is
full
and
tasty
a
slight
alcohol
prescense
is
noted
but
overall
a
warm
drinkable
malt
dopplebock
that
warms
the
tummy
on
cold
winter
days
drinkability
i
could
easily
sip
on
this
one
all
night
it
has
very
nice
flavors
that
are
simple
and
straightforward
and
a
nose
to
match
doesnt
sit
especially
heavy
but
i
can
see
where
after
a
few
one
may
say
enough
the
abv
could
also
become
a
factor
certainly
not
sessionable
at
nearly
8
but
i
think
2
would
be
good
for
a
night
the
mouth
is
full
and
brimming
with
depth
my
experience
with
this
style
has
yielded
surprisingly
thin
feels
on
most
this
one
is
full
and
hefty
what
i
would
expect
from
a
double
bock
this
is
a
maltbomb
for
sure
tons
of
sweet
toffee
caramel
faint
banana
light
booziness
that
complements
well
the
alcohol
adds
just
enough
to
the
flavor
without
making
it
overbearing
in
any
way
wonderfully
executed
this
is
a
stellar
beer
and
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
recommend
you
are
the
man
andy
d
the
website
says
that
this
doppelbock
is
very
reminiscent
of
an
octoberfest
yeah
i
can
definitely
see
that
i
would
say
it
has
more
in
common
with
the
later
im
going
to
go
out
on
a
limb
here
and
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
ive
ever
tasted
pours
a
pretty
ruby
burgundy
brown
color
with
a
thick
off
white
yellowish
head
and
tons
of
lacing
smells
of
roasted
barley
and
some
malts
well
blended
smooth
taste
with
barley
a
little
vanilla
and
some
heavy
malts
not
too
sweet
good
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
drinkability
drinks
more
like
some
kind
of
imperial
oktoberfest
but
is
still
quite
tasty
a
great
beer
for
the
season
one
of
capitols
best
just
more
proof
that
wi
knows
lagers
drinks
well
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
this
is
a
perfect
autumn
beer
and
seems
to
step
outside
of
the
boundaries
for
a
doppelbock
which
is
fine
with
me
a
very
worthy
brew
i
would
have
loved
to
have
had
another
of
these
and
in
fact
had
a
spare
thanks
to
zimmerbloke
but
i
somehow
managed
to
drop
an
entire
bottle
on
the
floor
and
kaboom
it
was
a
sad
sad
moment
drink
one
if
you
can
dont
drop
it
on
the
floor
d
overall
for
being
such
a
rich
and
flavorful
beer
this
one
has
insane
drinkablity
watch
that
abv
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
d
with
it
tasting
like
a
sweet
syrup
i
dont
think
ill
have
this
drink
too
often
or
when
the
season
arrives
it
is
most
certainly
a
good
doppelbock
its
full
of
taste
but
i
cant
get
over
the
syrup
like
fluidness
d
a
fantastic
dopplebock
perfect
for
the
fall
season
more
please
overall
i
enjoy
this
dopplebock
though
i
thought
there
would
be
more
malt
given
capitals
collection
of
bock
beers
in
there
lineup
i
think
they
do
bock
beer
about
as
good
as
any
american
brewery
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
with
light
tan
head
the
smell
is
of
earthy
malts
and
alcohol
secondary
sniffs
detect
cinnamon
banana
clove
and
orange
zest
the
taste
is
of
rich
malts
with
a
orange
and
alcohol
kicker
in
the
background
there
are
also
hints
of
what
seem
to
be
a
dr
peppersugary
plum
flavor
the
alcohol
as
expected
with
the
hops
bitters
on
the
tongue
this
is
really
carbonated
strongly
hence
my
thoughts
of
dr
pepper
with
the
plum
taste
this
is
pretty
good
and
for
a
doppelbock
its
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
as
ive
said
before
i
really
need
to
unpack
the
rest
of
my
glassware
my
snifters
gettin
tahred
this
brew
pours
a
clear
rich
garnet
topped
by
about
a
finger
of
hussywhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
rye
bread
toffee
brown
sugar
light
maple
syrup
and
some
fresh
mandarin
oranges
in
syrup
the
taste
is
heavier
on
the
bready
malts
with
plenty
of
brown
sugar
cinnamon
and
what
i
imagine
to
be
nutmeg
enhancing
things
later
on
the
buds
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
slightly
grainy
feel
overall
a
fairly
solid
dbock
nothing
altogether
special
but
still
quite
enjoyable
nonetheless
overall
dangerously
drinkable
much
less
metalically
tasting
than
their
other
lagers
hands
down
capitals
best
offering
pours
a
clean
reddish
to
copper
color
with
a
small
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
malt
and
a
small
fruitiness
in
the
taste
sweet
maltiness
and
a
small
hint
of
a
dry
caramel
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
muthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
and
sticky
caramel
aftertaste
not
a
malt
bomb
at
all
very
nice
my
first
offering
from
capital
and
its
a
good
one
i
wouldnt
necessarily
recommend
seeking
it
out
but
it
comes
up
big
if
youre
in
need
of
a
malt
fix
this
review
is
completed
from
notes
taken
while
travelling
through
madison
and
having
this
beer
on
tap
at
a
little
coffee
shoprestaurant
the
beer
in
the
glass
was
copper
or
dark
orange
with
a
light
head
the
nose
was
mildly
malty
the
initial
attack
was
a
mixture
of
malt
and
grain
the
flavor
grew
more
malty
as
the
beer
approached
the
finish
there
were
some
hints
of
the
smooth
malt
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
i
definitely
enjoyed
the
beer
but
i
would
say
that
it
wasnt
quite
oktoberfest
season
or
at
least
the
weather
wasnt
cooperating
when
i
drank
it
d
very
nice
i
love
the
take
on
the
style
drinkability
is
quite
high
in
my
opinion
largely
due
to
the
creamy
smoothness
of
the
beer
great
mouthfeel
and
intriguing
taste
make
this
a
winner
very
drinkable
very
good
beer
alcohol
wellhidden
notes
i
had
heard
good
things
about
autumnal
fire
and
it
certainly
lives
up
to
my
expectations
it
more
than
holds
its
own
with
the
classic
german
doppelbocks
this
style
and
especially
this
specific
beer
would
be
a
great
way
to
introduce
someone
to
the
world
of
wellcrafted
malty
lagers
the
autumnal
fire
is
a
very
unique
beer
it
is
somewhat
similar
to
an
octoberfest
style
beer
it
pours
a
very
dark
amber
color
nice
foamy
head
it
smells
sweet
almost
a
caramel
smell
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
in
the
taste
there
is
also
a
great
deal
of
carbonation
that
tingles
in
your
mouth
almost
a
burn
its
a
very
unique
beer
something
different
to
try
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
half
inch
of
offwhite
head
that
quickly
settled
to
a
thin
cap
very
little
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
a
lot
of
caramel
in
the
aroma
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
candied
sugar
big
malty
flavor
like
a
quadrupel
but
with
lager
yeast
caramel
and
figs
would
be
the
main
flavor
elements
quite
sweet
but
stops
short
of
being
cloying
alcohol
is
barely
detected
full
body
and
lightly
carbonated
feels
rich
and
smooth
overall
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
and
not
something
i
would
more
than
one
in
an
evening
well
made
and
worth
a
try
for
malt
lovers
given
my
expectations
of
a
syrupy
beer
im
happy
to
say
that
this
is
not
the
case
opening
with
a
blend
of
earthy
hoppy
bitterness
and
a
caramel
and
fruit
sweetness
dates
and
raisins
this
is
pretty
solid
stuff
in
fact
the
malt
is
not
as
assertive
as
id
expected
just
barely
countering
the
grainy
and
hoppy
bitterness
up
front
fruity
midpalate
this
beer
finishes
with
a
lingering
bitterness
and
some
burnt
toffee
medium
in
body
with
an
exceptional
soft
creamy
carbonation
this
beer
is
quite
the
treat
warming
me
well
on
this
cold
night
this
beer
really
hits
the
spot
overall
this
might
be
the
best
beer
made
in
wisconsin
certainly
one
of
the
best
us
lagers
ive
sampled
a
delicious
treat
i
look
forward
to
every
year
if
you
dont
like
sweetness
in
a
beer
this
not
for
you
i
thought
it
was
a
good
drink
on
its
own
or
after
dinner
it
is
a
like
a
liquor
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
hennepin
globe
this
beer
pours
a
truly
burnt
orange
with
a
decent
2
inch
creamy
orange
head
that
leaves
surprisingly
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
rather
mild
for
a
big
8
doppelbock
bread
and
toast
dominate
the
aroma
with
a
bit
of
toffee
and
just
a
slight
earthy
hoppiness
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
an
exact
copy
of
the
nose
while
the
bread
toffee
toast
a
bit
of
grass
all
come
through
on
the
palate
there
is
also
just
a
slight
medicinal
flavor
at
the
very
back
end
of
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
bit
light
im
kind
of
surprised
that
the
booze
is
so
high
but
the
body
is
so
light
it
definitely
reminds
me
more
of
a
bigger
ofest
then
a
doppelbock
oktoberfest
or
doppelbock
its
one
tasty
and
easy
drinking
beer
d
this
is
a
hard
beer
not
to
like
it
makes
a
good
afternoon
beer
afterdinner
beer
and
dessert
beer
for
dinner
pairings
i
would
recommend
hearty
foods
like
blandly
spiced
or
sweetly
marinated
roasted
meats
pork
or
duck
especially
and
coldweather
vegetablescarrots
turnips
brussels
sprouts
d
this
could
use
a
couple
months
on
it
to
let
the
alcohol
character
die
down
and
let
the
tastes
mingle
some
more
this
is
already
a
good
beer
and
it
shows
the
potential
to
be
great
with
some
aging
nice
medium
to
heavy
body
tad
heavy
on
the
carbonation
but
it
feels
pretty
robust
this
seemd
somewhat
tasty
at
first
but
drinking
this
bottle
is
more
than
enough
d
i
probably
could
have
another
of
these
but
not
sure
itd
be
a
go
to
for
the
night
d
a
very
nice
take
on
the
style
that
i
enjoyed
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
this
makes
an
impression
on
me
for
a
style
that
i
often
pass
over
medium
to
full
body
well
balanced
overall
a
rather
weak
malt
flavor
still
good
just
not
as
aggressive
as
it
could
have
been
there
is
a
slight
metallic
taste
to
it
i
expect
way
too
much
from
doppelbocks
mouthfeel
is
fine
drinkability
is
fine
drinkability
am
i
done
with
this
bottle
already
jesus
yes
another
please
overall
a
great
beer
and
worthy
of
a
shot
to
anyone
who
likes
this
style
my
first
doppelbock
that
i
can
recall
having
and
so
ill
need
to
experiment
more
with
the
style
d
highly
drinkable
theres
a
really
good
flavor
with
zero
alcohol
flavor
this
is
a
great
dopplebock
and
something
i
will
definitely
get
more
of
in
the
future
d
very
nice
warmer
easy
drinker
without
lacking
flavor
good
brew
mediumheavy
bodied
with
a
nice
but
not
overwhelming
amount
of
carbonation
a
pretty
complex
brew
that
really
reminds
me
of
an
oktoberfest
on
steroids
very
clean
flavors
and
a
pleasant
warming
effect
from
the
alcohol
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
makes
me
wish
i
would
have
picked
up
that
whole
six
pack
instead
of
splitting
it
for
my
mixasix
purchased
from
three
cellars
in
franklin
wi
pours
a
deep
reddish
amber
body
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
disappears
aroma
is
of
wood
and
toffee
reminiscent
of
a
scotch
or
barleywine
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
flavor
is
a
complex
woody
toasted
malt
it
gets
better
with
each
sip
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
i
would
really
call
this
a
light
barleywine
excellent
drinkability
ok
now
that
i
have
officially
reviewed
this
i
can
now
emphatically
state
that
this
founders
harvest
ale
and
surlyfest
are
my
favorite
autumn
brews
at
least
for
now
we
will
see
if
i
can
find
something
to
top
them
next
year
drinkability
is
good
and
perfect
for
these
fall
nights

that

huge

this

beer
for

ill
seek
out
in
a
trade
again
but
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
this
beer
also
has
one
of
the
coolest
labels
ive
ever
seen
if
it
was
in
posterform
id
be
putting
it
up
right
now
not
the
label
shown
on
this
page
decent
brew
by
a
good
brewery
enjoyed
a
cloudy
deep
amber
pour
with
a
small
but
lasting
light
tan
head
some
jagged
lacing
left
light
to
medium
carbonation
aroma
of
brown
sugar
toffeecaramel
and
bread
crust
flavor
is
a
little
more
complex
than
expected
earthy
sweet
malt
rasins
cinnamon
and
lightly
spicy
hops
lightly
bitter
but
more
sweet
than
anything
full
body
creamy
mouthfeel
a
light
peppery
pine
finish
alcohol
is
well
hidden
so
you
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
if
you
like
sweet
malty
brews
a
very
nice
beer
and
much
better
than
expected
poured
out
of
a
bottle
into
a
22
oz
weizen
glass
with
a
good
heavy
pour
it
has
a
nice
2
inch
head
that
doesnt
dissipate
a
light
brownish
amber
color
dominates
a
still
liquid
with
no
bubbles
the
smell
is
of
very
faint
caramel
with
a
forefront
of
raisins
figs
and
a
touch
of
anise
the
taste
reflects
the
aroma
running
forward
with
great
raisin
and
fig
flavors
a
lot
of
sweetness
to
this
beer
with
a
wonderful
malt
bill
you
can
tell
that
there
is
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
to
this
beer
but
it
is
in
a
warming
background
flavor
i
love
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
it
is
lightly
carbonated
on
the
tongue
silky
smooth
and
just
coats
your
entire
mouth
for
a
nice
long
finish
very
drinkable
for
a
dopplebock
i
can
definitely
have
a
couple
of
these
but
have
to
be
careful
because
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
what
the
lighter
side
of
doppelbock
can
be
if
anything
id
like
to
have
a
little
more
on
the
finish
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
shortlasting
white
head
and
no
lacing
great
toasty
sweet
sugary
caramely
aroma
with
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
and
apples
flavor
is
right
on
with
the
nose
caramel
covered
apples
jumps
out
at
me
right
away
with
a
nice
smack
of
caramel
and
rich
toasty
malts
borderline
cloyingly
sweet
but
is
kept
just
enough
in
check
by
the
earthy
hops
chewy
thick
mouthfeel
light
carbonation
light
alcohol
heat
detected
at
the
end
this
is
as
good
as
any
doppel
ive
had
and
rivals
many
bavarian
versions
good
stuff
this
one
this
year
like
the
oktoberfests
is
too
sweet
sigh
big
disappointment
poured
with
a
nice
off
white
head
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
lovely
clear
copper
aroma
is
malty
toffee
and
caramel
flavors
about
the
same
but
less
toffee
and
sweeter
bodys
good
and
carbonation
too
a
little
boozy
at
the
very
end
finish
is
d
pretty
good
beer
the
package
said
something
about
how
it
would
be
a
good
one
to
age
and
i
totally
agree
good
beer
and
it
shows
promise
with
age
i
love
this
time
of
year
and
this
beer
is
a
staple
of
midwest
brewing
culture
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
dopplebock
i
bought
a
6pack
with
the
hopes
of
squirreling
away
half
of
it
as
this
is
supposed
to
age
wonderfully
i
doubt
ill
be
patient
enough
to
find
out
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
appears
a
hazed
dark
copper
color
with
an
inch
of
fluffy
light
ecru
foam
nose
and
flavor
are
of
brown
sugar
medium
toasted
bread
and
grains
caramel
apples
sweet
malt
not
many
alcohol
notes
to
speak
of
approaching
full
bodied
slightly
rich
and
adequately
carbonated
any
doppel
fan
should
give
this
one
a
try
this
brew
pours
up
like
unfiltered
cranberry
juice
with
a
tiny
off
white
head
the
nose
is
cranberries
and
subtle
sweet
pale
malts
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
nose
but
more
intense
flavors
and
subtle
caramel
this
beer
is
too
sweet
for
me
medium
bodied
low
carbo
im
never
gonna
dance
again
d
at
nearly
9
this
is
a
nice
nightcap
the
booze
isnt
as
evident
as
i
expected
just
a
warming
glow
behind
the
wall
of
malt
a
decent
doppelbock
that
trends
to
the
lighter
side
d
thinking
this
as
an
imperial
fest
and
not
a
totally
traditional
doppelbock
per
se
this
is
quite
good
and
the
name
autumnal
fire
is
very
appropriate
the
abv
makes
this
unsessionable
but
i
could
easily
see
sipping
this
on
a
nice
fall
evening
as
the
leaves
turn
the
drink
is
mediumbodied
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
keep
the
slickness
from
erring
toward
the
sticky
syrupy
side
but
just
barely
extremely
drinkable
considering
the
abv
d
surprisingly
this
malt
based
beer
really
wows
me
its
fantastic
i
wish
i
had
more
of
these
babies
quite
possibly
the
best
dopplebock
ive
had
to
date
pours
out
a
nice
reddishbrown
with
big
off
white
head
that
fades
quickly
smells
like
malts
floral
hops
and
a
tinge
of
sweetness
not
too
much
on
the
nose
taste
however
is
on
the
mark
a
light
bodied
smooth
easy
drinking
doppelbock
especially
for
the
alcohol
content
sweet
malts
round
out
a
nice
crisp
hoppy
bitterness
that
makes
this
one
of
my
favorite
fall
brews
some
caramel
malts
ripe
fruitiness
sweet
finish
with
a
nice
warming
feeling
nice
carbonation
makes
this
a
very
easy
drinking
smooth
doppelbock
that
can
be
enjoyed
all
year
long
ddecent
drinkability
with
some
very
nice
flavors
in
this
beer
there
did
seem
to
be
a
bit
of
an
off
character
to
this
brew
but
this
did
not
detract
too
much
from
the
brew
drinkability
a
good
doppelbock
its
tastey
and
id
drink
it
again
but
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
a
6
pack
at
a
time
because
its
so
rich
the
only
negative
towards
this
beer
was
the
price
as
it
was
a
bit
more
than
capitals
other
six
packs
if
capital
can
improve
there
other
beers
up
to
the
level
of
this
one
they
will
be
all
the
more
better
as
for
now
this
beer
is
just
a
diamond
in
the
rough
solid
amberbrown
pour
whitish
head
malty
earthy
aroma
malty
carameltoffee
with
some
raisin
like
flavors
some
minute
sweet
spices
biscuity
caramel
apple
likeness
a
little
light
bodied
but
not
unusual
for
the
style
not
much
hop
presence
to
speak
of
first
beer
ive
had
from
capital
and
this
would
inspire
confidence
to
buy
others
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
dopplebock
pretty
easydrinking
and
very
affordable
md
medium
to
full
bodied
and
very
smooth
somewhat
creamy
as
well
fills
the
mouth
with
malt
sweetness
incredibly
easy
drining
and
very
deceptive
at
8
5
drinkability
a
fantastic
doppelbock
bready
as
hell
and
though
its
not
fantastically
complex
it
is
really
damn
tasty
and
if
the
alcohol
on
this
one
is
8
5
ill
be
damned
very
tasty
definitely
recommended
the
body
is
a
bit
light
but
some
sweetness
is
ok
lacks
the
complexity
i
would
like
to
see
in
a
dopplebock
overall
there
isnt
any
off
notes
but
the
recipe
to
me
is
closer
to
an
ofest
or
maibock
than
a
dopplebock
md
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
moderate
in
body
and
medium
carbonation
not
bad
but
i
just
couldnt
drink
much
of
it
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
somewhat
forgettable
not
sure
how
this
won
gold
at
the
2008
great
american
beer
festival
overall
a
nice
beer
and
thanks
to
shbobdb
for
the
incredible
trade
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
both
from
the
bottle
and
from
the
brewery
directly
i
always
look
forward
to
it
coming
out
because
it
is
very
good
and
i
will
look
forward
to
it
again
next
year
i
would
be
curious
to
see
how
it
ages
as
i
have
never
done
that
there
is
a
ice
version
of
it
that
has
gotten
better
with
age
enjoy
but
not
too
much
as
it
can
be
a
bit
intoxicating
cause
it
is
so
easy
to
drink
d
pretty
good
but
it
is
a
bit
sweet
for
my
palate
and
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
two
but
this
is
pretty
darn
good
for
the
style
this
was
a
gift
from
a
beer
loving
friend
with
family
in
wisconsin
i
poured
this
into
a
pilsener
glass
and
watched
as
the
the
head
grew
and
the
glass
was
filled
with
a
beautiful
warm
deep
orange
amber
hue
smells
and
tastes
of
caramel
and
toasty
malts
with
a
bready
mouthfeel
the
abv
has
a
nice
warming
effect
i
would
have
loved
another
delicious
though
all
sweet
dark
fruit
and
surprisingly
smooth
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
will
knock
you
back
looks
beautiful
deep
red
going
into
brown
in
the
glass
overall
i
thought
this
one
was
excellent
a
very
solid
dopplebock
and
just
a
nice
beer
all
around
another
quality
offering
from
capital
and
something
i
would
love
to
pick
up
again
d
excellent
mixture
of
sweet
spicy
and
smooth
this
beer
begs
no
commands
you
to
keep
drinking
it
pours
a
barely
foggy
amber
with
a
smaller
creme
head
flavor
is
malty
sweet
caramel
and
a
leafy
twig
tone
is
there
too
i
feel
like
i
am
getting
a
slight
alcohol
burn
too
feel
is
a
sticky
liquid
combination
and
the
carbonation
is
lower
but
smooth
with
a
slight
bite
a
nice
drinker
considering
its
abv
this
is
really
drinkable
maybe
i
just
dont
get
this
style
but
im
much
more
content
drinking
a
more
roasted
brew
or
a
malty
lager
with
a
more
upfront
smoky
characteristic
d
this
is
a
decent
doppelbock
for
an
american
brewery
it
seems
to
hit
the
style
on
the
nose
however
i
must
admit
that
i
prefer
some
of
the
classic
german
versions
a
little
more
perhaps
im
just
not
picking
up
that
unique
decoctionlike
malt
taste
in
this
version
nonetheless
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
worth
a
try
this
is
my
first
offering
from
capital
brewery
and
to
say
i
am
impressed
would
be
an
understatement
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
of
their
brews
love
those
folks
in
madtown
and
thanks
again
steve
i
cant
wait
till
we
trade
again
d
nice
a
nice
brew
for
a
cool
fall
evening
too
bad
i
work
on
halloween
night
or
i
would
put
a
few
of
these
away
capital
autumnal
fire
poured
a
very
dark
amber
almost
red
with
a
nice
head
smell
was
sweet
malt
with
the
faintest
hint
of
hops
taste
was
super
sweet
malt
with
caramel
notes
wave
of
sweetness
with
every
sip
mouthfeel
was
good
not
to
thick
drinkability
is
good
to
almost
to
good
with
the
abv
of
this
beer
you
need
to
be
careful
overall
this
is
another
great
beer
from
a
good
brewery
i
love
just
about
every
beer
i
have
had
from
capital
a
good
but
not
great
beer
that
gives
little
indication
of
its
alcoholic
strength
no
doubt
a
great
dopplebock
capital
really
didnt
do
anything
special
persay
they
did
however
make
a
great
no
frills
by
the
book
dopplebock
thanks
to
my
buddy
in
madison
for
mentioning
this
one
to
me
its
terrific
i
will
definitely
purchase
this
beer
again
damn
good
stuff
d

a
very
tasty
brew
thats
easy
to
drink
be
careful
of
the
elevated
abv
nice
deep
amber
color
crystal
clear
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
about
34
inch
after
the
pour
barely
detectable
smell
for
me
just
kind
of
smelled
like
a
fresh
light
beer
malty
taste
with
a
more
hoppy
finish
nice
alcohol
warming
from
the
high
abv
some
fruity
flavors
just
a
very
good
tasting
beer
mediumheavy
body
with
average
carbonation
very
drinkable
but
only
in
moderation
i
fear
because
its
a
strong
one
nice
beer
i
would
buy
this
for
friends
a
perfect
campfire
warmer
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
poured
a
thick
foamy
head
on
a
dark
amber
body
taste
and
smell
were
very
similar
and
delightful
very
sweet
fruity
with
some
carmel
despite
its
high
abv
it
was
very
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
little
or
no
alcohol
bite
ive
not
had
many
doppelbocks
but
if
theyre
all
like
this
one
im
definitely
going
to
excellent
revisited
this
beer
for
the
first
time
in
a
few
years
its
a
solid
doppel
seemed
a
little
unique
in
that
the
fruit
flavors
won
out
in
the
battle
with
the
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
a
tasty
beverage
drinkability
my
foray
into
doppelbocks
is
fairly
limited
but
this
is
pretty
tasty
im
not
sure
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
or
two
because
it
can
get
semi
cloying
but
its
definitely
not
too
bad
good
brew
thats
definitely
worth
a
shot
d
pretty
darn
drinkable
considering
the
higher
abv
unusual
taste
profile
begs
for
more
than
one
bottle
i
have
often
enjoyed
capitals
beers
so
i
was
surprised
that
this
beer
did
not
live
up
to
the
billing
of
my
friends
imo
very
nicely
balanced
this
beer
is
very
good
for
the
season
malty
and
spicy
like
a
good
oktoberfest
but
still
with
some
more
strength
and
complexity
as
a
doppelbock
d
very
drinkable
very
tasty
and
complex
with
a
great
mouthfeel
to
boot
this
beer
hides
its
weight
very
well
and
can
take
you
by
suprise
if
you
are
not
careful
only
wish
it
looked
a
bit
better
than
it
tasted
super
drinkable
for
an
8
5
abv
doppelbock
dangerously
so
a
fall
classic
probably
the
easiest
drinking
8
abv
beer
ive
ever
had
if
i
ever
find
this
on
tap
i
am
not
making
it
home
in
one
piece
a
malt
bomb
that
is
sweet
but
not
overly
so
earthy
and
nutty
very
toasty
alcohol
presence
is
readily
apparent
but
in
a
good
way
interesting
subtleties
in
the
flavor
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
very
nice
d
a
great
tasting
doppelbock
this
is
good
drinking
and
the
brewmaster
has
done
well
with
adding
his
own
touch
of
autumn
to
the
style
a
strong
pour
gets
a
hefty
two
inches
of
thick
tan
head
body
is
a
perfect
brown
with
tones
of
amber
on
the
edges
when
held
to
light
nose
has
tones
of
pie
crust
sweet
potatoes
and
candied
malt
honey
glazed
biscuity
feel
enters
the
mouth
with
first
sip
there
is
a
very
fruity
flavor
to
this
double
bock
as
it
is
crisp
and
very
refreshing
for
the
style
overall
it
has
a
syrupy
sweetness
and
then
a
bit
of
dry
almost
dusty
spice
like
bitter
on
the
end
of
the
palat
this
adds
nice
balance
mouthfeel
is
full
and
bold
with
a
malty
thickness
an
exceptionally
drinkable
bock
perfect
fall
beer
copper
ruby
color
with
minimal
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smell
fresh
hint
of
hops
tastes
toasty
malty
can
taste
alcohol
mouthfeel
decently
substantial
and
carbed
drinkability
seems
alcoholy
and
heavy
decent
enough
but
i
dont
think
id
have
more
than
one
until
it
got
a
bit
cooler
ovr
im
not
a
huge
dopplbock
fan
but
this
was
nice
well
balanced
with
good
flavor
dsolid
easy
drinking
and
smooth
a
nice
cool
season
brew
to
help
warm
up
the
internal
fire
would
love
to
have
more
caramelroast
in
the
nose
but
the
taste
does
pull
through
its
a
drinkable
beer
but
the
aftertaste
kind
of
gets
me
im
not
sure
if
i
would
go
back
for
another
at
least
not
out
of
the
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
clear
rubybrown
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
within
seconds
to
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
toffee
and
hints
of
butter
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
without
the
butter
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
and
a
sticky
texture
overall
this
is
a
nice
doppelbock
that
i
could
drink
again
d
a
solid
seasonal
brew
from
capitol
very
sessionable
despite
the
abv
d
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easy
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
this
is
a
good
stronger
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
until
the
abv
begins
to
catch
up
with
you
d
this
is
something
that
i
could
have
a
couple
of
but
i
have
a
hard
time
not
comparing
it
to
the
blonde
doppelbock
which
i
liked
more
something
id
certainly
pick
up
again
many
thanks
to
brandoman63
for
the
want
list
extra
pours
a
nice
crisp
dark
orange
with
a
decent
head
that
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
aroma
is
rich
fragrant
burnt
caramel
and
brown
sugar
quite
pungent
and
inviting
the
taste
is
also
a
wonderful
blend
of
caramel
brown
sugar
and
molasses
even
for
a
hophead
like
me
this
is
a
truly
spectacular
malt
showcase
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
fairly
well
hidden
alcohol
this
is
a
truly
wonderful
dopplebock
easily
the
best
american
one
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
i
didnt
know
much
about
this
beer
going
into
it
its
definitely
a
winner
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
would
seek
it
out
if
i
could
get
it
in
colorado
drinkability
great
drinkability
very
smooth
and
refreshing
the
higher
abv
doesnt
hamper
drinkability
a
bit
d
pretty
solid
ale
might
not
drink
a
whole
pack
in
a
night
based
on
8
5
but
hey
it
would
go
down
well
enough
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
a
pp
real
ale
glass
poured
a
clear
copper
color
with
thick
foamy
white
head
smell
is
an
abundance
of
sweet
malt
carmel
and
toffee
taste
is
like
liquid
sweet
bread
covered
in
carmel
with
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
medium
body
cant
tell
that
its
8
5
abv
and
can
say
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
double
bocks
now
why
are
the
best
ones
always
seasonals
this
one
is
worth
loading
up
on
during
those
fall
drips
into
wisconsin
to
start
with
it
comes
with
a
twistoff
cap
wtf
pours
a
hazy
light
brown
with
a
creamy
looking
head
that
fades
to
a
cap
that
sticks
around
for
a
little
while
the
smell
is
the
best
part
rich
and
malty
with
a
whiff
of
lager
yeast
alcohol
and
pear
tastes
pretty
good
just
not
as
rich
as
the
nose
suggested
nicely
balanced
though
with
sweet
malt
and
german
hops
earthy
spicy
piney
and
sweet
up
front
followed
by
a
long
bitterness
and
a
bit
more
spice
mouthfeel
is
relatively
big
and
a
little
prickly
pretty
drinkable
as
the
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
hidden
this
beer
is
a
gorgeous
deep
orangered
with
an
offwhite
head
smell
is
sweet
malts
light
fruits
and
melted
caramel
sweetish
malts
start
this
out
then
a
toasted
grainy
flavor
followed
by
a
brief
almost
cocoa
flavor
and
a
dry
finish
with
noticeable
warming
alcohol
lots
going
on
in
this
and
i
like
that
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
chewy
yet
viscous
only
grabbed
a
single
would
now
like
to
have
some
more
around
thanks
to
grynder33
pours
a
clear
dark
red
hued
amber
color
with
a
full
finger
light
tan
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
some
lacing
present
the
smell
is
nice
a
very
rich
caramel
malted
aroma
the
nose
helps
reveal
this
really
full
bodied
beverage
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
also
has
a
strong
tang
to
it
the
flavor
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
and
that
sharpness
could
be
a
tart
apple
dopplebocks
arent
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
a
good
drinker
thanks
davideddie
for
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
one
tasty
and
malty
caramel
and
toffee
along
with
honey
and
sweet
fruit
a
lightly
toasted
earthy
malt
finish
and
a
full
chewy
almost
honey
smooth
sticky
mouth
feel
completes
an
excellent
beer
thanks
again
randy
for
all
the
brews
you
sent
to
idaho
i
will
definately
be
doing
more
business
with
you
pours
a
clear
as
day
copper
with
a
3
finger
cream
colored
head
that
dies
to
a
small
ring
smells
of
big
sweet
malt
along
with
some
hefty
grain
taste
is
big
on
the
malt
and
is
almost
like
an
imperial
octoberfest
if
such
a
style
existed
alcohol
is
tasted
a
little
on
the
finish
medium
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
drinkable
yes
but
borders
on
a
session
beer
more
of
an
after
dinner
treat
nice
roasted
malt
flavorings
some
caramel
and
apple
in
there
as
well
solid
very
drinkable
beer
for
this
type
could
do
with
a
bit
more
carbonation
but
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
without
checking
my
reviews
im
going
to
guess
that
autumnal
fire
is
my
favorite
capital
beer
it
doesnt
match
the
excellence
of
the
versions
from
thomas
hooker
klosterbrauerei
andechs
and
brauerei
weihenstephan
but
then
those
are
pretty
big
shoes
to
fill
drinkability
i
know
this
is
a
doppelbock
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
the
ultimate
octoberfest
brew
i
will
denfinitely
be
looking
for
this
beer
around
ofest
time
next
year
you
have
to
try
this
one
pours
a
deep
clear
amber
with
a
small
light
tan
head
the
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
only
a
ring
on
my
pint
glass
the
smell
seems
to
be
sweet
malt
with
a
whiff
of
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
yeast
i
am
slowly
warming
up
to
the
doppelbock
style
this
had
a
very
sweet
taste
and
just
enough
carbonation
to
help
clean
the
palate
i
found
this
selection
to
be
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
i
will
make
a
point
to
seek
out
some
of
next
falls
batch
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
lovely
reddish
mahogany
a
thick
offwhite
head
creamy
with
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
full
of
malty
goodness
caramels
and
toffee
toasty
and
enticing
me
to
drink
the
taste
is
fantastic
caramels
and
toasted
malts
rich
and
full
and
sweet
buoyed
by
a
fair
hop
presence
a
very
nice
body
pretty
full
and
with
nice
light
carbonation
the
alcohol
slightly
warming
but
kind
of
hiding
in
all
this
is
one
delicious
doppel
i
want
more
thanks
brandoman63
for
the
opportunity
highly
recommended
i
had
this
ontap
at
the
palm
tavern
in
milwaukee
drinkability
is
good
this
brew
is
magnificent
an
excellent
dopplebock
and
a
great
autumn
brew
the
flavors
and
alcohol
content
will
shy
some
drinkers
away
however
overall
another
wonderful
example
of
capitals
strength
in
making
great
brews
cheers
overall
a
very
good
doppelbock
and
one
that
deserves
a
higher
rating
in
my
opinion
malty
taste
sweetish
but
not
overly
sweet
with
a
minot
hoppy
bite
think
rich
vienna
lager
or
light
doppelbock
or
somewhere
in
between
not
as
rich
as
i
expected
but
pleasant
and
very
easy
to
drink
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
a
great
beer
i
like
it
more
than
salvator
but
i
like
my
doppels
a
little
darker
maltier

sweety

good
dose

nice
little

that
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
out
thanks
steve
recommended
for
sure
drinks
very
easy
for
the
abv
a
veryvery
nice
dopple
overall
i
didnt
know
this
was
a
doppelbock
until
i
went
to
review
it
i
thought
it
was
a
decent
regular
amber
lager
of
sorts
i
wasnt
really
all
that
impressed
with
it
which
suprises
me
since
it
gets
quite
a
bit
of
praise
in
many
reviews
maybe
a
bad
sample
i
am
definitely
going
to
revisit
this
one
to
find
out
thanks
for
the
bottle
democorhip
autumnal
fire
is
an
excellent
doppelbock
from
capital
enjoyable
easy
drinking
and
great
flavor
the
high
point
without
taking
anything
away
from
the
flavor
is
the
mouthfeel
autumnal
fire
has
that
exact
color
too
it
a
beautiful
autumn
sunset
of
burnt
orange
a
nice
two
finger
khaki
colored
head
that
dies
down
to
a
nice
lacing
stickiness
is
pretty
good
here
and
there
on
the
side
of
the
glass
very
mild
smelling
like
most
doppelbocks
delicious
carameltoffee
that
also
has
a
slight
yeasty
white
bread
character
but
lacking
a
bit
in
aroma
taste
is
much
of
the
same
as
the
nose
a
big
delicious
malt
explosion
in
the
mouth
so
much
caramel
malt
flavoring
but
a
bit
of
milk
chocolate
seems
to
surface
on
the
tounge
as
well
dark
fruits
seem
to
give
way
as
well
raisins
dates
and
plum
mouthfeel
is
so
smooth
exactly
what
you
would
expect
in
a
doppelbock
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
i
hardly
detect
any
alcohol
in
this
8
5
beauty
great
representation
of
this
style
if
you
enjoy
bocks
definitely
pick
this
one
up
flavors
follow
the
same
imprint
of
the
nose
subdued
apple
washed
in
caramel
and
toffee
the
fruitytoffee
notes
are
reminiscent
of
aventinus
on
a
lighter
scale
very
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
suggests
the
addition
of
a
small
amount
of
hops
light
toffee
candyish
sweetness
nicely
balanced
and
barely
a
hint
of
the
abv
a
couple
would
be
the
minimum
in
one
sitting
give
me
the
eisphyre
has
a
rusty
carmel
color
with
12
inch
of
fluffy
cream
colored
head
which
leaves
some
lacing
i
smell
carmel
and
it
has
a
barley
type
malt
aroma
with
some
sweet
raisin
scent
there
is
little
alcohol
smell
and
not
much
hops
either
tastes
good
heavy
roasted
malt
flavor
almost
burnt
im
tasting
a
little
barley
some
carmel
and
a
faint
hop
flavor
at
the
end
has
a
pretty
smooth
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
pretty
smooth
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
i
think
it
has
a
lot
of
flavors
that
seem
to
all
work
well
with
each
other
d
delicious
beer
better
than
most
counterparts
in
germany
in
my
opinion
i
like
this
brewery
bottle
courtesy
of
sammy
poured
a
medium
to
deep
clear
brown
color
ale
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
average
retention
but
good
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
is
more
reminiscent
of
a
barley
wine
then
a
doppelbock
but
is
interesting
nonetheless
taste
is
dominated
by
sweet
malt
with
some
very
subtle
cloves
but
no
banana
notes
can
be
found
here
body
is
about
average
with
some
medium
carbonation
and
no
alcohol
is
discernable
overall
this
was
more
akin
to
a
barley
wine
then
a
doppelbock
but
was
quite
enjoyable
nonetheless
good
drinkability
for
an
8
5
beer
you
can
pick
out
the
alcohol
but
it
works
well
in
the
style
sits
fairly
light
for
its
size
overall
good
flavor
and
aroma
a
good
brew
if
you
like
the
style
d
besides
the
texture
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
taste
is
sweet
but
not
to
the
point
of
exhausting
the
palate
this
could
be
a
very
good
session
beer
pours
a
nice
14
inch
head
with
a
lacing
it
has
a
light
brown
color
to
it
the
smell
is
sweet
and
has
light
coffee
flavors
that
remind
me
of
good
doppelbocks
the
taste
is
sweet
and
has
burnt
sugars
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
smooth
and
isnt
harsh

i
will
have
this
again

nice

a
good
autumn
brew
to
ward
off
the
chill
not
much
of
a
head
and
it
didnt
stick
around
for
long
body
was
brown
with
hints
of
ruby
the
sweet
smell
of
caramel
and
roasted
malt
taste
was
semisweet
some
roastiness
and
a
very
light
hop
finish
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
for
a
doppelbock
i
find
this
very
drinkable
d
much
better
than
i
remember
in
the
bottle
the
8
5
abv
is
well
hidden
in
smell
and
taste
until
a
few
pints
sneak
up
on
you
this
one
doesnt
exactly
fit
in
with
other
dopplebocks
in
my
opinion
but
it
is
a
fabulous
beer
anyway
thanks
to
jpm30
for
my
first
taste
of
this
brew
prositund
zum
wohl
mk
the
taste
was
a
bit
bready
and
sweet
with
a
mildly
bitter
finish
not
bad
but
not
my
style
i
couldnt
tell
if
this
was
a
doppelbock
or
just
a
strong
oktoberfest
not
the
kind
of
thing
i
would
drink
en
masse
but
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
especially
in
cooler
weather
ill
eagerly
wait
for
this
to
come
around
next
year
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
but
with
less
complexity
and
a
bit
strong
in
alcohol
definitely
drinkable
though
with
a
nice
smooth
body
nice
but
only
a
bit
above
average
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
beer
and
dangerously
easy
to
drink
for
the
listed
alcohol
8
2
i
think
i
still
prefer
celebrator
but
i
almost
look
at
these
as
two
different
animals
the
celebrator
has
better
flavor
but
this
one
is
a
bit
easier
to
drink
tough
choice
drinkability
its
not
bad
but
it
doesnt
impress
my
palate
either
boldly
or
subtly
and
its
true
what
they
say
this
beer
can
catch
up
with
you
enjoy
overall
i
dont
see
what
the
fuss
is
all
about
regarding
this
beer
its
good
but
it
didnt
do
anything
amazing
for
me
the
drinkability
is
unreal
this
is
the
ultimate
germanstyle
session
beer
drinkability
fruitier
and
sweeter
than
when
i
last
had
it
with
little
by
way
of
detectable
booze
or
hops
this
might
be
a
little
sweet
for
some
folks
but
a
year
in
the
cellar
has
really
helped
this
beer
develop
even
more
depth
than
it
had
before
this
is
their
best
doppelbock
but
it
isnt
amazing
d
drinkable
yes
good
tasting
bock
that
i
would
definately
have
on
tap
if
possible
drinkability
notes

easy
to
drink
for
the
style
great
body
and
low
carbonation
adds
to
the
smooth
flavor
the
first
half
was
fine
on
its
own
and
the
second
half
was
great
with
some
roast
pork
thanks
too
nflmvp
for
this
one
d
this
is
a
nice
doppelbock
with
good
complexity
and
nice
sweet
malt
that
is
not
over
sweet
the
hops
were
soft
and
they
left
me
wanting
more
hops
but
they
really
helped
keep
the
malt
in
balance
i
get
the
feeling
this
sample
is
not
as
fresh
as
it
could
be
but
it
was
very
nice
very
nice
drinkability
i
feel
ike
this
could
have
more
booze
than
it
lets
on
but
its
just
a
hunch
the
glass
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
pours
a
tea
color
with
a
light
head
that
really
sticks
around
well
throught
the
drinking
of
the
beer
the
clarity
is
only
moderate
with
a
light
carbonation
bubbling
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
nice
and
fruity
good
notes
of
fif
almond
to
almost
candied
cherry
with
a
toastyness
playing
behind
it
with
a
big
inhale
there
are
faint
notes
of
spice
as
well
flavor
is
dominated
with
the
fruity
fig
the
toasty
melanoidans
hit
secondarily
to
break
up
some
of
the
fruityness
this
one
is
working
well
for
me
there
is
a
touch
of
deep
caramelization
as
well
that
accentuates
the
fruity
sweetness
feel
is
on
the
thicker
end
of
moderate
with
a
light
to
moderate
carbonation
that
doesnt
break
things
up
too
much
defnately
a
nice
beer
not
something
to
drink
a
lot
of
too
fast
as
the
flavors
are
very
bold
but
something
to
savor
and
enjoy
definately
a
better
beer
than
i
gave
it
credit
for
before
ill
get
this
one
again
drinkability
great
aftertaste
another
great
dopplebock
from
capital
brewery
spicy
caramel
and
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
dark
fruits
fill
the
nose
tanorange
body
holds
up
a
smallish
white
head
and
little
lace
sweet
and
alcohol
spicy
caramel
malt
dark
cherries
and
poundcake
are
big
flavor
elements
very
nice
flavor
and
a
very
nice
beer
smuggled
a
bottle
of
this
back
from
my
trip
to
madison
the
code
2585

is
printed
on
the
neck
of
the
bottle
another
beer
i
got
in
a
trade
and
i
do
not
know
who
sent
it
lost
my
papers
that
i
try
to
keep
track
of
trades
but
thanks
to
the
one
that
sent
it
poured
a
amber
with
a
off
white
head
that
didnt
leave
any
lacing
aroma
caramel
fruits
that
leaned
to
being
over
ripe
not
in
a
bad
why
roasted
malts
didnt
pick
up
any
alcohol
flavor
the
fruit
comes
out
1st
than
caramel
and
malts
with
a
nice
touch
of
alcohol
good
beer
so
next
fall
ill
pick
up
a
6pack
and
hope
that
this
promising
yet
overrated
brew
finds
its
own
personality
middle
of
the
road
is
not
greatness
its
dangerous
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavy
and
sticky
more
heft
than
an
average
ofest
more
flavor
range
than
an
average
dbock
a
bit
thicker
than
most
seasonals
but
if
it
was
available
locally
it
would
make
my
annual
fridge
list
deep
honeybrown
in
color
with
next
to
no
head
the
smell
is
fairly
sweet
with
definite
roasted
malts
and
nice
background
of
bitter
hops
the
taste
is
very
bold
with
loads
of
heavy
malts
and
only
a
touch
of
a
hoppy
finish
the
taste
is
quite
lingering
and
expands
to
great
depths
of
maltyness
as
it
warms
the
flavor
get
a
nutty
charecter
which
is
pleasant
i
admit
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
even
a
little
oily
its
also
fairly
warming
but
im
not
sure
what
the
abv
is
so
that
may
be
expected
this
beer
makes
a
nice
alternative
to
some
of
the
more
common
oktoberfest
beers
a
nice
slow
drinking
beer
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
warms
the
palate
12
ounce
bottle
bright
reddishbrown
color
topped
with
a
half
inch
of
offwhite
foam
huge
malty
flavor
with
a
little
fruit
the
flavor
is
a
beautiful
balance
between
the
sweet
and
the
bitter
starts
off
with
a
creamy
sweet
malt
flavor
with
a
bit
of
vanilla
then
comes
in
some
bitter
tea
flavor
along
with
spicy
hops
throughout
is
a
fruity
cherry
flavor
mouthfeel
is
full
this
is
a
great
dopplebock
and
my
favorite
beer
from
capital
i
will
admit
i
was
worried
this
was
overrated
i
have
been
far
from
moved
by
any
capital
brews
thus
far
i
thought
wild
rice
was
pretty
terrible
and
i
probably
should
have
rated
it
lower
the
oktoberfest
is
pretty
good
but
this
one
is
extremely
impressive
im
not
too
familiar
with
their
line
yet
but
they
appear
to
be
a
very
versatile
brewery
with
a
specialty
on
some
traditional
german
styles
go
figure
im
probably
going
to
try
and
track
down
a
6
pack
tommorow
not
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
though
after
18
oz
or
so
a
mucus
formed
over
the
roof
of
my
mouth
and
it
started
to
reject
something
in
it
this
happens
to
me
when
i
drink
to
much
barley
wine
too
i
think
its
my
mouths
way
of
saying
ive
had
enough
autumnal
fire
is
a
pretty
amberred
color
with
a
beautiful
beige
head
that
once
gone
does
not
provide
particularly
good
lacing
its
combination
of
extreme
maltiness
and
fairly
prominent
alcohol
in
the
nose
and
taste
give
it
an
appleish
character
plus
some
caramel
from
the
malt
mouthfeel
suffers
a
bit
from
the
stinging
alcohol
but
the
beer
feels
pretty
full
and
crisp
in
your
mouth
i
liked
the
thomas
hooker
liberator
better
as
far
as
dobbelbocks
go
because
it
was
more
chocolately
and
hid
its
alcohol
better
however
autumnal
fire
is
a
damn
fine
beer
in
its
own
right
just
not
as
desserty
as
i
was
expecting
nose
is
much
more
pungent
than
i
remembered
with
burly
citrus
and
caramel
malt
notes
body
is
much
than
fresh
and
without
the
hops
bitterness
making
this
quite
sweet
booze
has
mellowed
in
the
mouth
as
well
still
a
fantastic
beer
with
a
sweet
new
profile
a
really
strong
seasonal
pours
a
goldenorange
color
with
good
about
of
co2
head
rises
to
and
inch
and
falls
above
the
high
alcohols
smells
sweet
fruity
and
alcoholic
tastes
sweetness
reminescent
of
overripe
oranges
apples
peaches
and
pears
a
good
amount
of
peppery
spice
comes
along
the
body
full
and
rich
in
the
middle
with
a
thin
syrupy
texture
finishes
sweet
and
a
little
fusal
because
of
the
alcohol
its
a
sipper
a
refreshing
break
after
tasting
oktoberfests
all
night
has
a
heady
doppelbock
aroma
worth
sticking
your
nose
deep
into
the
glass
not
exactly
as
red
as
other
comments
have
led
me
to
believe
but
a
rich
color
nonetheless
deep
and
rich
bock
taste
befitting
a
gabf
medalist
thanks
to
the
monk
for
this
simply
fantastic
beer
ive
always
held
out
that
penn
is
the
best
lager
brewery
in
the
country
and
every
time
ive
mentioned
that
someone
has
come
back
with
capital
well
i
can
see
their
point
as
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
while
this
may
not
be
the
traditional
doppelbock
this
is
such
a
good
enjoyable
beer
with
a
nice
tartness
that
brings
out
the
plumish
nature
of
a
good
dopplebock
very
nice
and
one
id
be
glad
to
have
again
this
really
is
drinkable
i
dont
notice
the
alcohol
too
much
and
the
sweetness
draws
me
back
as
its
not
too
cloying
atleast
for
one
bottle
however
after
about
3
or
4
i
could
see
this
beer
really
becoming
cloying
and
too
syruppy
but
this
one
bottle
just
made
me
want
more
very
nice
but
not
quite
the
level
of
their
dark
dbock
thanks
craig
the
flavor
is
mostly
malt
with
some
fruity
over
tones
and
a
very
light
carmelized
backdrop
some
hop
bitterness
is
present
but
not
he
main
atraction
mouth
feel
was
smooth
little
sweet
clear

mostly

aroma
is
deep
malty
very
fruity
and
somehow
delicately
farmy
in

diplomatic

several

notes

not

substance
8

after
all
mango
and
not
quite

greenish
oranges
accompany
obvious
leather
tones
very
approachable
at
first
but
developping
into
a
surprisingly
bold
fruitiness
and
more
alcohol
at
it
reaches
room
temperature
medium
bodied
lightmedium
carbonation
is
appropriate
excellent
and
charming
doppelbock
example
with
unique
characteristics
but
is
it
really
better
than
95
of
the
german
examples
further
samplings
shall
tell
hopefully
one
of
the
best
american
beers
in
my
book
mmmm
a
nice
velvety
spread
of
liquid
and
warmth
hits
the
senses
right
off
commanding
nose
of
hazelnut
gelato
doused
in
sweet
cherry
sauce
atop
a
gingerbread
house
floating
in
bread
pudding
malty
sweet
but
craftily
balanced
and
a
brew
that
would
fool
the
most
indignant
german
quaffer
choice
brew
from
the
upper
midwest
where
autumn
does
actually
require
a
fire
overall
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
great
beer
the
one
qualm
i
could
possibly
voice
with
this
one
is
perhaps
that
there
is
sort
of
an
unbalanced
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
for
me
there
is
a
definite
whiskeylike
character
to
the
flavor
but
when
you
drink
whiskey
there
is
sort
of
a
lingering
sweetness
this
beer
does
not
have
that
if
it
did
i
would
have
no
choice
to
give
it
straight
5s
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
is
better
than
many
of
the
german
versions
ive
tried
very
tasty
and
the
medium
body
promotes
very
good
drinkability
thanks
to
kmpitz2
and
orbitalr0x

bringing
this
beer
to
my
attention

kmpitz2

the

the
flavor

theres
something
odd
here
im
not
sure
what
it
is
the
drinkability
is
great
for

i

i

this

by

right
up
nice

amazing

wonderfully
drinkable
and
feels
just
right
in

mouth
wow
what
a
great
brew
i
have
to
give
props
to
bashiba
for
shipping
this
one
to
me
well
done
a
malty
brew
this
has
a
butterscotch
flavor
that
helps
smooth
the
finish
but
is
also
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
this
butteriness
reduces
the
mouthfeel
quality
a
little
but
its
not
bad
drinking
more
than
one
doppelbock
in
a
sitting
isnt
always
easy
but
this
is
an
exception
just
watchout
since
it
packs
quite
a
punch
drinkability
is
exceptional
absolutely
delicious
and
refreshing
as
near
to
perfection
for
style
imho
dark
chestnut
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
small
nut
coloured
head
the
aromas
are
sweet
malty
and
full
with
a
nice
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
mix
as
well
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
some
wonderful
nuttiness
in
the
mix
as
well
the
middle
of
this
brew
is
very
dessert
like
and
reminiscent
of
caramel
as
well
of
course
the
finish
is
awesome
as
well
with
a
lovely
soft
pretzel
like
flavor
ensuing
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
not
too
syrupy
as
some
doppels
are
and
the
drinkability
is
excellent
as
well
this
is
up
there
with
the
liberator
as
far
as
us
doppels
go
pours
an
amber
color
that
reminds
me
of
fallen
leaves
cool
evenings
in
front
of
a
bonfire
and
pumpkin
pie
head
recedes
to
a
tiny
ring
no
lacing
smells
of
caramelly
spicenice
taste
is
all
warming
malt
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
but
with
a
nice
spice
there
to
keep
it
from
becoming
too
cloying
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thini
was
expecting
something
bigger
nevertheless
this
is
a
nice
brew
perfect
for
those
crisp
fall
nights
has
a
fruity
aroma
full
of
rich
heavy
fruits
and
sweet
caramelized
malt
nice
mouthfeel
a
bit
on
the
weaker
side
of
depplebocks
excellent
mouthcoating
character
nicely
balanced
with
the
alcohol
note
becoming
overpowering
as
some
other
examples
do
not
as
heavy
or
strong
as
others
but
this
is
a
very
easily
drinkable
version
definetly
a
good
example
to
try
if
you
have
never
had
a
dopplebock
before
as
some
can
be
a
bit
intimidating
this
is
a
great
find
a
nice
carmel
brownamber
in
the
glass
with
a
nice
white
foamy
head
smells
a
little
spicey
and
definitely
looks
like
autumn
in
a
glass
very
tasty
a
nice
blend
of
malt
spice
and
a
hint
of
hoppiness
this
brew
went
down
awfully
easy
i
could
easily
see
this
being
a
session
beer
on
a
saturday
evening
watching
college
football
i
will
definitely
revisit
this
brew
in
october
another
fine

without
knowing
what
my
fiancee
had
poured
before
we
started
drinking
and
without
having
looked
up
the
style
once
i
did
know
i
was
a
bit
surprised
to
find
myself
in
a
bit
of
a
nappy
daze
after
putting
it
back
pretty
quickly
drinkablity
defined
notes
a
masterfully
made
beer
and
one
ive
been
lusting
after
for
some
time
once
again
feloniousmonk
youve
outdone
yourself
thanks
again
for
this
midwestern
gem
great
name
i
wasnt
sure
what
style
this
beer
was
upon
purchasing
in
fact
i
wrongly
assumed
it
to
be
a
marzen
thus
i
wasnt
too
excited
now
after
savoring
this
one
bottle
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
more
maybe
next
autumn
pours
a
dark
copper
maroon
with
a
nicelylaced

smells
of
rich

sugar
cookies

a
big
tasting
doppelbock
toffee
throughou
with
carrot
cakerumsoaked
bread
finish
is
tangy
bitter
with
lingering
sweetness
and
alcohol
a
hearty
doppelbock
with
a
chewy
feel
my
favorite
capital
lager
easily
i
was
surprised
and
excited
to
find
this
limited
release
beer
in
central
ohio
and
it
didnt
disappoint
a
good
one
mediumfull
body
with
gentle
carbonation
this
beer
is
almost
too
drinkable
nah
this
beer
pours
the
color
of
some
of
the
falling
leaves
it
has
a
reddish
hue
with
a
nice
thick
off
white
head
when
the
head
gave
way
a
nice
sticky
lace
was
left
behind
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
sweet
caramelroasted
twist
to
it
a
nice
mixture
of
the
two
you
could
also
mention
toffee
in
the
description
the
taste
is
smooth
hops
at
first
then
a
nice
malt
rush
comes
into
play
a
nice
and
chewy
malt
flavor
an
enjoyable
and
quaffable
beer
here
not
much
notice
anywhere
of
alcohol
in
the
aroma
and
taste
but
there
was
that
slight
warm
feeling
in
the
gut
once
youre
done
a
very
nice
double
a
clear
deep
orangeish
mahogany
body
reveals
orange
and
scarlet
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
its
full
creamy
lighttan
head
holds
well
and
leaves
some
very
nice
lace
the
aroma
delivers
rich
toasty
dark
caramel
and
toffee
malt
notes
as
well
as
some
delicate
alcohol
the
body
is
medium
bordering
on
full
and
the
carbonation
is
fine
and
moderate
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
zesty
upfront
before
warming
across
the
palate
to
become
lightly
creamy
the
flavor
is
richly
malty
and
toasty
with
dark
crystal
notes
balanced
by
some
leafy
and
tealike
hop
flavor
that
lends
an
almost
licorice
note
to
it
a
solid
bitterness
lends
to
its
dry
finish
although
some
sweetish
toasted
malt
does
linger
although
its
not
a
really
complex
beer
it
is
very
rich
and
engaging
very
unique
like
a
very
big
vienna
lager
rather
than
a
darker
more
chocolatey
or
roasted
doppelbock
certainly
worth
trying
ontap
still
amazing
to
look
at
with
an
amazing
color
deep
ruby
reddishorange
fire
color
with
a
maple
syrupy
brownish
tone
to
it
only
difference
from
bottle
to
tap
was
the
head
was
pretty
thin
and
more
bubbly
aroma
is
malty
sweetness
lots
of
sticky
caramel
with
some
notes
of
thick
starfuit
and
very
dulled
dark
citrusylike
plums
orange
and
melons
taste
is
much
like
the
bottle
with
a
great
sweetness
which
is
smoother
and
thicker
then
the
bottle
with
huge
amounts
of
caramel
malts
some
toffee
and
very
dulled
fruits
starfruit
dull
orange
and
just
a
load
of
malty
sweetened
goodness
chewy
and
sticky
smoother
over
all
and
fuller
body
feel
ontap
with
a
little
bit
more
texture
and
longer
lingering
sweetness
in
the
finish
holy
fckin
yum
a
super
easy
drinker
ontap
goes
down
super
nice
al
my
man
this
was
great
i
drank
a
few
to
many
and
i
couldve
had
alot
more
and
now
im
feeling
it
the
next
morning
yikes
the
pour
a
brilliant
burnished
copper
color
with
the
head
pythonic
in
size
creamy
in
consistency
and
a
beauteous
light
tan
color
as
it
ever
so
slowly
fades
into
obscurity
a
satiny
curtain
remains
to
ensconce
the
glass
the
aroma
of
raisins
maybe
even
over
ripe
plums
also
sweet
malt
and
a
slight
musky
tone
noticed
excellent
nose
to
be
sure
start
is
ambrosial
thick
with
malt
and
the
top
middling
in
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
benign
in
its
acidity
the
hops
delightful
in
their
spiciness
very
dry
and
lingering
aftertaste
one
quaffable
brew
tis
true
a
hearty
thank
you
to
feloniousmonk
for
this
bottle
as
i
sit
and
listen
to
another
monk
as
in
thelonious
deep
copper
color
with
a
moderate
tan
head
beautiful
roasted
malt
and
almost
vanilla
notes
in
the
aroma
theres
a
definite
sweetness
but
a
bit
of
hop
spiciness
pushes
through
the
taste
is
very
smooth
with
a
decent
amount
of
good
butterscotch
notes
along
wth
a
healthy
dose
of
malt
good
chocolate
notes
combined
with
noteable
sweetness
in
the
midpalate
is
swept
away
by
adequate
bittering
on
the
finish
perhaps
im
crazy
but
that
vanilla
note
comes
back
in
the
aftertaste
silky
smooth
on
the
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
pretty
good
just
a
slight
amount
of
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
it
does
not
deter
from
the
overall
enjoyment
of
the
beer
a
dopplebock
yum
this
one
poured
a
small
sized
tan
head
that
was
fully
dissipated
the
body
was
dense
with
a
copper
hue
the
nose
consisted
of
malt
and
caramel
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
flavor
tasted
of
alcohol
malt
and
caramel
with
a
tingly
and
smooth
mouthfeel
this
beer
was
medium
bodied
and
there
was
no
lacing
a
lasting
lingering
flavor
with
considerable
weight
on
the
palate
this
is
just
the
thing
to
cradle
in
your
hands
when
autumn
stands
up
tall
and
starts
to
show
its
true
power
bidding
you
to
prepare
for
the
hard
months
to
come
before
the
barleywines
and
imperial
stouts
become
de
rigeuer
autumnal
fire
is
the
perfect
doppelbock
to
fill
in
as
the
comfort
against
the
cold
this
is
an
excellent
american
example
of
the
style
i
sandwiched
this
in
between
two
salvators
which
doesnt
seem
quite
as
good
as
i
remember
and
it
more
than
held
its
own
a
little
brighter
of
a
flavor
perhaps
some
hops
are
noticed
but
still
true
to
the
style
the
usual
maltbutterscotch
taste
is
there
and
a
nice
smooth
body
head
disappated
quickly
with
little
to
no
lacing
although
its
no
celebrator
i
think
its
right
in
there
with
salvator
korbinian
bajuvator
and
moretti
larossa
which
is
saying
something
as
i
am
fond
of
all
of
those
good
work
capital
and
thanks
for
the
sample
monk
thanks
to
felonious
for
this
dark
beauty
thanks
for
feloniousmonk
for
the
sample
ahh
a
delight
to
pour
on
this
cool
fall
day
here
in
chicago
the
color
is
all
fall
with
a
deep
brown
hue
that
is
highlighted
by
burning
red
and
flaming
orange
the
head
is
rich
and
murky
it
fades
fairly
quickly
but
the
lace
is
firm
and
ever
present
the
aromatics
are
at
once
rich
and
warming
with
abundant
malt
raisin
and
nutty
milky
chocolate
nuances
in
the
mouth
the
beer
sings
this
is
a
meal
and
true
to
the
style
i
think
the
monks
would
like
this
stuff
loads
of
rich
malt
creamy
chocolate
milk
like
aromas
long
full
bodied
and
complex
in
the
mouth
with
bitter
mocha
more
chocolate
and
raisinnutsthe
alcohol
is
very
warmingand
integrated
well
as
not
to
overwhelm
this
is
a
slow
sipper
so
be
careful
as
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
had
a
couple
watching
game

of
the

series

can
it
get
much
better
definitely
a
doppel
bock
huge
malty
blasts
of
dried
fruits
raisons
a
bit
of
bready
malts
and
a
little
caramel
fairly
assertive
tastes
of
alcohol
as
well
creamy
mouthfeel
somewhat
unexpected
but
pleasant
significant
warmth
from
the
alcohol
all
the
way
down
hmm
i
can
find
no
information
on
the
abv
but
ive
got
to
think
its
well
north
of
6
or
7
im
going
to
buy
some
more
and
see
how
it
keeps
the
appearance
epitomizes
fall
colors
with
a
beautiful
dark
brown
and
garnet
body
topped
by
a
khaki
colored
head
a
familiar
capital
doppelbock
aroma
reveals
itself
the
nose
consists
of
malt
candied
raisins
dates
and
molasses
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
the
taste
consists
of
sweet
malt
caramel
oak
and
fruit
almost
like
feint
cherry
the
warming
alcohol
almost
adds
an
odd
flavor
charateristic
in
the
finish
and
is
pretty
noticable
throughout
as
an
underlying
element
to
me
this
detracts
a
little
and
doesnt
seem
to
balance
with
the
other
flavors
in
that
aspect
as
the
beer
warms
to
room
temp
it
almost
takes
on
a
brady
or
cognaclike
flavor
and
essence
top
notch
this
is
a
fine
brew
but
i
get
burned
out
on
oktoberfest
taste
just
a
personal
thing
the
dangerous
part
about
an
oktoberfest
style
brewed
to
a
doppelbock
strengthis
its
drinkability
choose
your
designated
driver
early
or
stay
at
home
yeah
this
is
a
good
stay
at
home
beer
originally
sampled
on
19
november
2002
this
beer
has
a
redorange
color
the
flavor
is
quite
malty
its
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
it
finishes
with
a
slightly
sweet
tangy
taste
in
my
opinion
its
quite
an
enjoyable
doppelbock
ill
have
to
arrange
to
get
some
again
dont
know
who
i
got
this
from
but
i
think
them
much
probably
cokes
im
not
always
a
fan
of
doppelbocks
as
i
think
they
can
be
a
little
tedious
sometimes
with
the
intensity
of
the
munich
malts
i
can
almost
always
appreciate
a
good
example
of
the
style
though
i
rarely
want
more
than
one
capitals
autumnal
fire
while
definitely
a
doppelbock
through
and
through
gets
higher
marks
for
drinkability
from
me
for
the
simple
reason
that
although
it
meets
the
classical
guidelines
it
also
manages
to
be
interesting
without
being
unusual

pleasantly

tremendously
smooth

doesnt

to
my
point
of
displeasure
rich

without
heavy
roast
or

nice
lingering

without
excessive

very
smooth

sweet

balanced
thick
heavy
and
very
tasty
another
great
one
from
this
great
brewery
this
is
my
favorite
so
far
from
capital
pours
a
deep
redorange
color
with
a
foamy
thick
tan
head
the
bread
clean
aroma
is
one
of
the
most
inviting
of
the
fall
seasonals
the
bold
malt
profile
is
touched
with
a
fresh
bisuit
flavor
the
aggressive
spice
bitterness
makes
me
picture
a
perfectly
balanced
seesaw
with
malt
on
one
side
and
hops
on
the
other
drooping
on
each
side
from
the
weight
of
each
element
warming
complex
and
flavorful
thanks
to
bighuge
for
this
one
this
beer
is
a
deep
beautiful
scarlet
color
a
little
head
fades
to
nothing
similar
to
some
barleywines
ive
had
deep
thick
malt
aroma
this
beer
is
a
dopplebock
but
the
body
is
in
the
medium
to
mediumfull
range
the
taste
is
wonderful
deep
smooth
malt
also
get
some
notes
of
vanilla
oak
dark
fruit
and
wood
if
i
were
to
compare
this
beer
to
another
id
look
at
the
jw
lees
harvest
ales
for
similar
taste
profiles
this
beer
tastes
as
much
like
a
barleywine
to
me
as
it
does
a
dopplebock
i
think
the
av
for
this
beer
is
around
8
5
i
cant
pick
up
any
sign
of
alcohol
though
brewed
to
perfection
by
the
lager
master
kirby
nelson
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
wisconsin
brewed
beers
amazing
one
of
wisconsins
very
best
shit
one
of
the
very
best
thick
pour
very
yellow
head
and
an
overall
color
of
premium
light
maple
syrup
wonderful
mouthfeel
much
heavier
than
a
fest
but
not
sticky
flavor
notes
of
light
rum
some
raisin
and
a
serious
buttery
toffee
and
floating
caramel
impression
on
the
tongue
first
rate
cinnamon
spice
close
satiny
smooth
with
senses
of
vanilla
warming
alcohol
great
for
cool
weather
exceptional
amount
of
good
oldfashioned
great
malt
flavor
and
highly
unusual
in
not
needing
a
more
classical
balance
we
have
a
first
class
brew
here
one
of
the
finest
beers
ive
had
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
billed
as
a
doppelbock
with
an
octoberfest
feel
me
and
my
brother
do
a
lot
of
blind
taste
tests
and
we
were
unsure
what
to
do
with
this
one
we
placed
it
in
our
doppelbock
test
in
the
spring
and
the
octoberfest
in
the
the
fall
it
rated
near
the
top
in
both
doesnt
have
the
character
of
a
paulaner
salvator
but
much
easier
drinking
and
extremly
tasty
a
guy
could
get
in
trouble
kicking
back
more
than
a
few
of
these
as
they
are
very
tasty
and
very
very
easy
drinking
a
high
quality
beer
from
the
king
of
bocksdoppelbocks
shocked
how
high
this
is
rated
overall
being
a
fan
of
good
american
porters
and
brown
ales
i
highly
enjoy
this
as
i
find
some
similarities
the
dark
fruit
light
chocolate
and
vanilla
caramel
toasted
grains
etc
the
taste
actually
reminds
me
of
a
weaker
version
of
dogfishs
palo
santo
marron
it
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
and
is
extremely
dribkable
a
winner
in
my
book
deep
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
meaty
chocolatetinted
head
that
lasts
breadiness
coffee
and
caramel
in
the
aroma
smooth
and
creamy
with
rich
coffee
fig
and
cherry
flavors
flat
root
beer
and
a
quick
burst
of
malt
sweetness
the
total
package
pairs
exceptionally
well
with
highquality
chocolate
and
it
comes
with
a
toy
for
the
kids
too
overall
i
have
not
had
this
style
too
many
times
nor
am
i
a
big
fan
but
i
am
able
to
identify
a
topnotch
wellmade
beer
this
is
one
of
them
smelled
and
looked
wonderful
taste
was
bit
fruity
with
banana
like
flavor
but
thats
expected
with
german
wheat
beers
truly
an
exceptional
example
of
a
most
maltforward
style
nuanced
balanced
and
yet
substantial
in
every
way
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
color
with
a
two
finger
medium
dark
cream
head
aroma
is
dark
fruit
molasses
roast
and
slight
bittersweet
chocolate
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
bit
of
spice
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
almost
a
bit
chewy
which
i
love
in
a
dopplebock
overall
a
very
fine
dopplebock
and
a
world
class
beer
and
example
of
the
style
celebrator
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
huge
light
brown
head
it
smells
faintly
of
dark
fruits
earth
and
herbs
the
taste
is
much
stronger
of
said
fruit
earth
and
herbs
it
tastes
like
creme
brulee
with
notes
of
caramel
and
vanilla
just
not
a
style
that
i
enjoy
strange
one
i
dont
get
how
this
is
top
250
it
wasnt
very
good
o
a
very
tasty
doppelbock
good
level
of
balance
and
is
highly
drinkable
overall
this
is
definitely
worthy
of
being
regarded
as
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
out
there
what
sets
this
apart
from
other
great
ones
like
korbian
and
salvator
is
the
mouthfeel
which
is
creamy
smooth
and
clean
as
far
as
flavor
goes
its
right
on
par
with
the
other
two
yet
unique
in
its
own
right
great
beer
and
a
must
try
doppelbock
this
is
a
rather
delightful
drinking
experience
o
great
dopplebock
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
have
had
it
before
and
will
buy
it
time
and
time
again
overall
an
excellent
beer
very
flavorfull
and
smooth
smells
of
dried
fruit
malty
currant
tastes
of
dried
fruit
yeasty
cherry
some
wheat
really
nice
malt
flavor
really
well
balanced
medium
body
and
carbonation
dark
fruit
and
malt
aftertaste
this
is
truly
a
treat
o
a
standard
of
the
style
that
is
a
malt
lovers
dream
and
the
drinkability
is
simply
perfect
delicious
sweet
and
malty
but
not
overly
so
one
of
the
best
in
its
class
do
i
love
malt
why
yes
i
do
this
stuff
is
almost
too
good
deepest
brown
pour
with
dense
tan
clingy
head
aromas
of
toast
bready
malt
some
esters
and
yeast
flavors
similar
to
smell
with
a
heavy
malt
presence
dominating
the
show
there
are
only
a
handful
of
brews
with
which
if
they
were
the
only
available
in
the
world
i
could
be
completely
content
this
is
one
of
them
best
beer
ive
had
in
47
years
awesome
it
made
all
my
wildest
dreams
come
true
good
dark
beer
i
was
lucky
to
find
it
here
in
hawaii
a
must
try
if
you
like
dark
malt
caramel
coffee
kind
of
beer
it
has
a
rich
taste
im
not
a
expert
reviewer
i
just
know
a
good
beer
when
i
taste
one
if
you
dont
like
dark
beer
then
dont
try
it
but
if
you
like
porter
style
coffee
malt
then
a
must
try
just
my
opinion
of
course
o
oozed
class
would
love
to
make
a
loaf
of
bread
with
this
im
also
intrigued
to
know
what
a
year
of
aging
would
do
to
this
poured
from
an
iconic
12
oz
bottle
complete
with
miniature
plastic
ram
in
to
a
small
glass
mug
the
assertive
carbonation
yields
a
massive
mounded
head
of
foam
that
resembles
an
ovenrising
baked
biscuit
the
beer
has
a
deep
chestnut
brown
appearance
with
tawny
accents
it
smells
of
freshbaked
whole
grain
bread
and
a
vague
notion
of
sweet
nuttiness
earthy
accents
of
soy
sauce
and
molasses
are
present
in
the
nose
as
well
the
flavor
is
very
maltforward
but
steers
well
clear
of
the
cloying
sweetness
that
so
many
other
malt
monsters
convey
theres
some
dark
fruits
with
hints
of
subtle
tart
black
cherry
a
mild
earthy
hop
profile
perfectly
accentuates
the
distinct
bavarian
flavors
suggestions
of
smooth
sweet
dark
coffee
and
minerals
linger
in
the
aftertaste
the
texture
of
the
beer
is
phenomenal
rich
and
creamy
velvet
perfection
oh
so
easy
to
savor
for
such
a
hearty
beer
this
is
sooo
easy
to
drink
its
simply
a
masterclass
ive
yet
to
try
a
dopplebock
foreign
or
domestic
that
i
put
in
the
same
league
as
celebrator
from
the
iconic
artistic
style
to
the
wonderfully
smooth
texture
to
the
refined
bavarian
taste
this
one
is
just
incredible
the
definition
of
world
class
o
very
enjoyable
the
roastedsmoky
note
i
got
at
midpalate
is
out
of
place
for
the
style
but
i
liked
it
dark
red
in
color
smells
chocolatey
tastes
chocolatey
as
well
there
is
a
hint
of
that
lager
flavor
nice
amount
of
carbonation
and
fairly
creamy
this
is
quite
tasty
i
got
more
dark
fruit
znd
raisin
than
i
was
expecting
even
some
faint
cinnamon
definitely
has
the
hefty
bread
mouthfeel
and
flavor
youd
expect
due
to
some
great
malt
notes
a
little
burnt
sugar
and
molasses
in
there
as
well
a
meal
replacement
beer
for
sure
just
an
incredibly
wellconjured
beer
the
perfect
embodiment
of
the
style
a
really
wonderful
experience
that
hits
the
spot
in
an
unexpected
way
truly
one
of
the
most
delicious
beers
in
the
world
the
paulaner
monks
practiced
making
awesome
double
bock
beer
for
several
centuries
and
they
definitely
got
it
right
if
you
are
in
la
you
can
find
this
beer
at
nicks
in
beverly
hills
it
is
the
only
place
i
have
ever
seen
it
on
draft
even
more
interesting
and
lively
than
in
bottle
sweet
malty
creamy
dark
sweet
fruits
like
fig
always
a
treat
overall
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
it
is
a
great
beer
no
doubt
but
there
was
no
wow
factor
or
any
reason
that
it
should
be
above
the
rest
the
beer
pours
dark
and
smooth
with
medium
head
the
smell
is
malty
and
no
hops
taste
is
sweet
and
carmel
molasses
sweet
corn
silky
and
smooth
lacy
not
my
favorite
beer
style
so
while
i
appreciate
this
beer
and
how
well
made
it
obviously
is
its
only
an
occasional
drinker
for
me
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
deep
dark
ruby
cast
excellent
head
volume
world
class
lacing
and
retention
light
nose
of
molasses
coupled
with
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
plum
fig
and
a
slight
undertone
of
spice
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
smooth
texture
that
has
creamy
aspects
below
normal
carbonation
with
just
a
touch
of
effervescence
in
the
finish
the
world
class
flavor
profile
is
reasonably
intense
very
complex
and
superbly
balanced
it
begins
with
a
wave
of
sweet
malt
that
is
at
first
caramel
and
slightly
burned
dark
sugar
then
flows
into
a
rich
molasses
in
the
middle
as
the
molasses
fades
dark
fruit
becomes
evident
as
does
an
ever
so
slight
hop
bitterness
the
finish
is
a
slow
sweet
fade
with
notes
of
alcohol
excellent
mouth
feel
medfull
bodied
first
aroma
is
malt
followed
prunesplums
caramel
then
raisins
some
may
think
molassas
but
think
about
what
prunesplums
smell
like
very
malty
in
factmelanoidins
gotta
love
that
decoction
mash
and
long
boil
hop
addition
is
perfect
this
brew
is
made
to
perfection
for
a
doppelbock
nice
tan
head
followed
by
lace
i
also
reccomend
the
smuttynose
smuttonator
a
doppelbock
these
two
are
my
favorite
doppelbocks
no
hops
no
dryness
to
this
one
just
tones
of
balanced
malt
coming
at
you
great
bavarian
doppelbock
great
paired
with
a
variety
of
high
quality
game
sausages
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
soapy
light
tannish
head
there
does
not
seem
to
be
too
much
carbonation
and
there
is
a
little
lacing
the
odor
is
malty
sweet
slight
roasted
note
slightly
nutty
some
coffee
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
very
rich
silky
at
first
malty
vanilla
dark
fruits
dark
berry
a
slight
dry
bitterness
at
the
very
end
sipping
on
one
of
these
while
snacking
on
86dark
chocolate
this
beer
is
a
real
treat
tastes
a
lot
of
raisins
and
figs
simply
delicious
cheers
overall
a
fantastic
doppelbock
and
worth
getting
my
only
problem
is
that
its
expensive
to
get
other
than
i
really
do
recommend
getting
it
great
beer
with
great
aroma
and
wonderful
taste
however
taste
has
a
bit
of
a
strong
bite
for
a
7
beer
would
make
you
think
its
a
9
a
beautiful
and
oatmealy
dark
beer
refreshing
and
pleasant
at
all
times
wonderful
my
first
doppelbock
an
ok
beer
but
will
probably
not
get
it
again
o
i
received
this
beer
as
a
christmas
gift
from
my
brother
and
after
one
sip
it
emerged
as
the
most
memorable
gift
of
the
season
absolutely
magnificent
this
beer
was
very
strong
the
taste
was
ok
i
just
remember
getting
wasted
off
of
this
beer
i
wish
i
could
give
more
details
but
it
was
memorable
thats
for
sure
this
is
pretty
darn
good
beer
everything
looked
good
and
felt
right
except
the
flavor
was
not
great
one
of
the
alltime
great
beers
sweet
and
smooth
and
delicious
this
is
the
standard
bearer
for
this
style
not
sure
how
i
missed
this
one
a
while
back
long
finish
of
malt
meat
smoke
hints
of
licorice
overall
although
i
am
not
particularly
well
versed
in
doppelbocks
this
one
is
a
very
easy
drinker
with
excellent
taste
definitely
deserving
of
its
popularity
best
doppelbock
available
in
the
us
hands
down
definitely
one
of
the
best
and
most
potent
doppelbocks
available
smooth
and
tasty
with
no
harshness
at
all
make
sure
you
have
a
designated
driver
or
enjoy
at
home
i
gave
this
one
a
straight
4
75
on
all
attributes
even
though
i
would
struggle
to
find
flaws
that
prevented
it
from
being
a
perfect
5
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
phenomenal
thick
foamy
head
that
almost
spilled
over
furthermore
the
creamy
lace
retains
throughout
the
whole
drink
wonderful
aroma
reminds
me
of
coffee
dark
slightly
bitter
chocolate
and
sweet
earthy
grains
taste
aligns
with
aroma
and
includes
an
aftertaste
that
is
creamy
and
with
a
tiny
touch
of
hops
furthermore
there
is
a
mild
alcohol
aftertaste
like
a
dark
dessert
liqueur
great
feel
carbonation
light
but
tingly
on
the
tongue
when
served
cold
this
is
the
first
doppelbock
i
have
reviewed
here
and
i
feel
like
i
have
struck
gold
by
picking
amongst
the
cream
of
the
crop
for
this
style
i
will
enthusiastically
seek
this
one
out
again
330ml
bottle
in
pint
glass
beer
pours
intensely
dark
brown
nearly
opaque
but
with
a
red

mild
but
malty
aroma
flavor
is
super
rich
with
layers
upon
layers
of
malty
goodness
carefully
balanced
and
neither
bitter
nor
chalky
this
is
adult
candy
alarmingly
drinkable
at

abv

overall
a
terrific
beer
holidays
or
no
deservedly
beloved
sooo
smooth
liquid
silk
wove
this
stuff
overall
not
aweful
but
if
youre
in
the
market
for
something
like
this
you
can
certainly
do
better
i
do
recommend
having
this
with
some
y
fenni
cheese
otherwise
known
as
red
dragon
celebrator
lives
up
to
its
reputation
as
the
doppelbock
the
sweetness
is
big
and
complex
without
being
overbearing
and
the
bitterness
and
mouthfeel
lend
excellent
contrast
while
still
allowing
the
malt
to
shine
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
celebrator
is
the
best
representation
of
the
style
ive
yet
encountered
overall
like
the
dunkel
from
this
brewery
its
my
favorite
in
the
style
the
dopplebock
seems
to
get
a
bit
more
praise
but
i
feel
the
similarities
through
and
through
its
a
perfect
premeal
in
a
bottle
on
a
cool
autumn
day
love
it
o
given
the
wooden
and
slightly
earthy
notes
this
doppelbock
carries
i
understand
why
many
tout
it
as
the
best
of
the
doppelbock
line
i
am
in
no
way
suggesting
this
is
undeserved
nor
that
this
is
a
poor
quality
beer
in
any
way
shape
or
form
but
it
is
not
my
favorite
doppelbock
as
a
devout
malthead
the
odd
notes
that
seem
like
hops
trying
to
come
a
little
too
forward
for
my
liking
cut
down
on
my
enjoyment
when
i
want
a
doppelbock
i
want
glorious
unrelenting
malt
and
associated
flavors
not
anything
trying
to
balance
or
even
display
hop
flavors
hence
my
rating
this
beer
below
other
doppelbocks
in
spite
of
my
unabashed
privatbraurei
aying
fanboyism
nice
creamy
froth
very
smooth
it
has
a
subdued
malty
taste
overall
this
beer
is
real
special
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
german
beer
maltiness
bready
goodness
so
big
and
bold
in
flavor
but
not
too
big
in
alcohol
this
would
be
awesome
with
pot
roast
great
dopplebock
malty
sweetish
molasses
and
caramel
flavors
a
bit
more
hops
would
make
it
a
5
in
my
book
poured
into
a
tall
glass
huge
5
finger
head
which
dissipates
to
a
nice
frothy
cap
very
dark
brown
with
an
attractive
auburn
or
dark
red
hue
almost
no
light
comes
through
when
held
up
to
light
definitive
chocolate
and
malt
flavor
with
notes
of
coffee
and
perhaps
a
distant
plum
sort
of
a
roasted
taste
on
the
back
end
smooth
mouth
feel
with
some
bitterness
and
carbonation
reminds
me
of
some
porters
ive
had
low
alcohol
by
volume
almost
too
low
but
i
like
beers
with
a
higher
than
6
abv
overall
a
very
agreeable
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
poured
a
deep
deep
brown
clear
when
help
up
to
the
light
a
thick
tan
fizzy
head
settles
down
to
a
light
covering
and
leaves
small
amounts
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
malty
with
notes
of
dark
fruit
and
dark
toffee
the
taste
is
equally
malty
with
a
nice
herbal
hops
to
balance
it
and
a
slight
spicy
quality
to
the
finish
the
body
is
thick
and
full
almost
heavy

onothing

it
just
gives
you
a
well

taste
ooverall
this
beer
is
fantastic
overall
the
flavors
are
well
balance
between
the
sweet
maltiness
and
the
burnt
finish
not
as
complex
as
i
hoped
it
to
be
but
still
outstanding
o
worth
every
pennie
o
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
the
originals
not
quite
as
big
as
a
would
have
imagined
but
a
solid
beer
o
by
far
the
easiest
doppelbock
ive
tasted
and
possibly
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
tasted
rich
and
powerful
deep
and
thick
but
not
overly
strong
sour
or
bitter
lots
of
wonderful
notes
and
a
very
fragrant
nose
dominant
flavors
are
malt

malt
with
some
caramel

followed
by
some
subtle
coffee
and
citrus
hints
wonderfully
balanced
maybe
the
best
balanced
beer
ive
ever
sampled
unbelievably
drinkable
for
this
thickness
this
beer
is
the
real
deal
german
doppelbock
ator
ending
and
all
from
visual
appeal
to
taste
packaging
is
beautiful
with
the
dark
brown
bottle
as
backdrop
for
the
light
blue
label
punctuated
by
the
amberred
glass
of
beer
the
finishing
touch
which
i
love
see
picture
is
the
small
goat
hung
from
a
red
threadjust
a
classy
finishing
touch
to
say
were
really
proud
of
our
product
very
eye
catching
beautiful
nearly
black
amber
color
so
inviting
with
the
creamy
tan
head
washes
smoothly
beautifully
over
the
tongue
very
complex
but
well
blended
flavors
with
ever
so
slight
chocolaty
notes
to
me
some
bitterness
on
finish
but
not
overpowering
the
only
thing
that
detracted
for
me
a
bit
resulting
in
a
slightly
lower
aroma
score
was
the
aroma
upon
finishing
the
pourit
was
slightlyno
other
word
for
ittin
canny
ever
so
slight
but
just
noticeable
it
did
not
in
any
way
come
through
in
the
actual
taste
of
the
beer
and
was
then
indistinguishable
by
half
way
through
the
glass
of
beer
drunk
from
a
stemmed
rounded
belly
goblet
that
allows
aromas
to
experienced
well
this
was
my
first
tasting
so
it
may
have
been
an
aberration
aside
from
that
aspect
which
i
cant
call
very
minor
since
for
me
the
prefirst
drink
aroma
experience
is
part
of
the
overall
experience
the
beer
is
superb
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
a
friend
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
and
he
fell
in
love
with
it
o
though
im
not
much
of
a
lager
guy
i
would
reach
for
this
all
the
time
if
the
price
were
lower
flavorful
and
slightly
robust
with
a
wellhidden
abv
i
can
see
why
this
is
so
revered
a
classic
o
amazing
beer
not
sure
how
i
missed
it
but
it
is
among
the
best
i
have
had
a
must
try
final
thoughts
to
speak
simply
i
would
like
to
put
this
on
my
corn
flakes
in
the
morning
this
beer
is
freaking
amazing
and
i
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
this
style
of
beer
this
beer
is
great
and
i
am
drinking
it
very
easily
this
evening
worthy
doppel
for
certain
dont
overlook
this
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
beer
has
a
little
foam
head
smell
is
chocolate
taste
is
like

coffee
it
is
a
light
beer
considering
it
is
a
dark

very
smooth
like
a
nitro
beer
mouth
feel
is
light
o
a
delicious
doppelbock
avery
attractive
aooearing
and
smelling
beer
the
flavor
is
typical
of
the
doppelbock
style
but
is
neither
too
sweet
nor
too
bitter
just
a
moderately
priced
tasty
beer
worth
having
a
case
in
the
cellar
by
far
the
best
dopplebocks
i
have
ever
had
and
probably
my
favorite
beer
sure
its
costly
and
hard
to
find
but
it
is
worth
while
found
it
down
in
edwardsville
il
at
a
bar
that
only
serves
craft
brews
and
imports
if
you
can
find
it
youll
like
it
guaranteed
a
fine
doppelbock
it
was
fairly
sweet
boozy
with
a
good
combination
of
dark
fruits
spice
that
went
down
a
treat
this
one
was
a
pretty
fine

of

at

bottled
date
unknown
i
normally
dont
drink
this
type
of
beer
being
an
ipa
guy
but
as
this
beer
had
great
ratings
i
thought
id
give
it
a
try
i
was
not
disappointed
at
all
a
dark
brown
molasses
almost
with
a
nice
light
brown
foamy
head
that
dissipated
after
a

s
very

tasted

in

very
little

of

if
you
stick
this
in

be
sure
to
let

15
minutes
before

dont

very
pleased
and
looking
forward
to
drinking
the
three
others
overall
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
i
wasnt
too
fond
of
the
aroma
but
otherwise
its
solid
poured
a
deep
brown
with
a
reddish
tint
and
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
receded
to
an
offwhite
ring
leaving
abundant
lacing
very
nice
looking
scents
of
rich
caramel
sweet

dark

especially
prune
brown
sugar
and
bready
malt
very
malt
forward
and
rich
and
very
true
to
style
excellent
flavor
begins
incredibly
malty
with
notes
of
molasses
dark
fruit
especially
prune
and
raisin
a
light
flavor
of
german
hops
and
a
light
hint
of
chocolate
moving
into
some
moderate
smooth
and
warming
alcohol
and
a
light
toasted
flavor
finish
is
dry
with
warming

hits
every
last
style
note
in
every
last
category
and
does
it
well
a
joy
to
drink
and
probably
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
a
delicious
mixture
of
many
different
flavors
that
all
blend
together
to
create
an
outstanding
rich
and
decadent
brew
o
an
excellent
beer
overall
celebrator
has
been
a
favorite
that
im
finally
getting
around
to
review
leaves
other
doppelbocks
in
the
dust
with
its
balanced
flavors
and
wellhidden
alcohol
a
great
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
year
round
o
exemplary
example
very
complex
for
the
style
an
absolutely
wonderful
beer
other
notes
if
you
check
the
alström
bros
review
it
looks
like
they
made
a
mistake
in
jasons
review
he
gives
the
beer
an
overall
rating
of
3
5
out
of
5
but
every
other
aspect
of
the
beer
taste
appearance
smell
and
mouthfeel
got
a
4
5
out
of
5
or
higher
seems
like
he
made
a
typo
when
setting
the
overall
rating
seems
like
it
should
have
been
4
5
instead
of
3
5
overall
very
nice
doppelbock
that
reminds
me
of
my
time
in
bavaria
delicious
creamy
and
malty
as
expected
a
very
good
and
accessible
example
of
the
style
get
more
of
it
o
so
so
malty
doesnt
really
contribute
many
flavors
that
i
usually
seek
out
although
it
does
somehow
present
them
better
than
other
beers
with
similar
profiles
my
score
is
boosted
for
its
perfectly
representing
the
style
however
different
it
is
from
my
preferences
it
is
pleasant
but
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
or
maybe
pound
it
o
gets
the
55
as
it
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
just
as
good
as
always
and
a
must
try
for
any
beer
lover
this
beer
puts
the
doppel
in
bock
this
beer
is
legen
wait
for
it
smells
like
a
german
angel
who
bathed
in
syrup
and
worked
8
hours
in
a
candy
shop
bakery
combo
toffee
syrup
carmel
malt
balls
and
taste
like
you
put
a
sweet
swizzle
struessel
dessert
bread
in
a
blender
with
the
dna
of
a
1500
year
old
monk
not
too
thick
and
hard
to
drink
like
it
would
lead
you
to
believe
does
smell
and
taste
a
hair
on
the
boozy
side
but
that
is
about
the
only
thing
bad
i
could
say
about
it
it
even
comes
with
a
souvenir
goat
what
more
could
you
ask
for
dary
originally
reviewed
on

no
bottle
date
i
could
detect
o
a
good
spring
brew
a
tried
and
true
german
favorite
would
not
hesitate
to
pick
this
up
again
o
doppelbocks
arent
usually
my
thing
but
theres
no
way
you
cant
appreciate
how
great
this
beer
is
the
6
7
masks
amazingly
well
i
could
crush
this
beer
so
easily
the
unique
flavors
meld
perfectly
together
this
is
absolutely
world
class
and
im
kicking
myself
for
continually
passing
it
up
time
after
time
o
this
beer
is
sensational
not
only
the
best
bock
ive
had
but
one
of
the
best
beers
damn
id
definitely
pair
this
with
roast
game
or
roast
pork
with
some
spice
this
is
definitely
an
appropriate
beer
for
roaring
fires
and
red
meat
off
the
bone
o
fantastic
beer
we
did
pint
glasses
at
57f
and
could
have
drank
a
lot
more
generally
higher
alcohol
beers
taste
like
it
but
this
was
simple
and
easy
to
drink
with
no
hint
of
the
higher
alcohol
esters
pours
a
deep
brown
that
nearly
appears
black
hues
reminiscent
of
dark

through
only
at
the
fringes
a
generous
3

head
developed
and
lingered
briefly
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
molten
brown

earthen

the
flavor
amplifies
these
notes
and
adds
a
nice
bready
background
flavortexture
some
fruity
elements
date
plum
and
even
a
hint
of
pear
push
through
on
the

mouthfeel
is
superb
with
a
viscous
fullbodied
consistency
and
clean
slightly
effervescent
finish
overall
this
is
something
of
a
styledefining
beer
for
me
and
i
tend
to
gauge
the
quality
of
other
dopplebocks
against
it
celebrator
is
well
balanced
fullbodied
and
rich
in
flavor
combined
with
its
availability
and
affordability
its
a
firstclass
choice
o
an
excellent
doppelbock
compared
to
the
andechs
the
contrast
between
the
various
flavors
is
more
pronounced
bolder
the
andechs
has
more
of
an
integrated
balanced
flavor
plus
a
firmer
mouthfeel
in
this
headtohead
comparison
the
andechs
wins
by
a
nose
you
cant
go
wrong
with
either
o
a
solid
well
executed
beer
o
while
i
wouldnt
say
its
as
good
as
salvator
i
would
say
that
its
way
better
than
most
other
bottom
fermented
beers
overall
i
havent
had
this
in
a
while
for
no
reason
i
forgot
how
good
and
delicious
it
tasted
ill
be
buying
or
more
often
now
the
oftproclaimed
king
or
queen
of
dopplebocks
certainly
this
brewery
is
one
of
the
best
at
executing
traditional
german
styles
and
i
delved
into
this
with
high
expectations
enjoyed
on
tap
at
craft
beer
market
in
calgary
served
in
an
authentic
celebrator
glass
aroma
is
full
of
dark
sweet
malt
and
buttery
notes
dried
dark
fruits
butterscotch
molasses
espresso
and
unexpected
some
celery
seed
spice
where
am
i
getting
that
from
its
there
i
swear
probably
a
yeast
phenolic
element
or
due
to
spicy
hops
tastes
like
chocolatecovered
coffee
beans
fresh
pipe
or
cigar
tobacco
dates
and
raisins
prunes
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
yields
a
chocolate
milkshake
effect
rich
and
sweet
but
earthy
in
the
finish
with
a
moderately
thick
body
that
coats
the
mouth
i
found
that
the
bitter
earthy
roasted
flavors
were
more
salient
for
the
first
half
or
so
at
which
point
more
of
the
sweet
buttery
flavors
reared
their
heads
the
alcohol
is
warming
but
not
aggressive
believe
the
hype
its
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
ive
sampled
and
strikes
a
nearperfect
balance
between
roasted
earthy
bitter
and
sweet
domains
o
inviting
color
perfect
scent
and
flavor
lighter
than
it
looks
lives
up
to
its
reputation
as
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
in
the
world
o
best
dopplebock
that
i
have
had
a
o
i
gave
this
beer
a
fair
review
and
i
can
definitely
say
theres
a
lot
of
good
about
it
i
just
recognize
that
it
really
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
or
beer
it
was
definitely
worth
a
try
though
and
i
would
recommend
it
heartily
to
people
that
dont
enjoy
lighter
beers
and
dislike
the
charred
coffee
taste
of
stouts
and
lagers
its
sweeter
and
not
as
harsh
as
some
of
the
stouts
that
i
enjoy
but
i
wasnt
much
of
a
fan
of
the
alcohol
on
the
nose
and
palate
i
feel
like
it
needed
more
body
and
more
complex
flavors
to
compliment
the
alcohol
finish
o
i
dont
have
a
long
history
with
bock
beers
but
it
this
is
any
indication
of
the
experience
i
might
have
found
a
new
favorite
type
of
beer
very
nice
head
almost
pitch
black
nice
lacing
vibrant
smell
of
sweet
raisin
and
malts
great
sweetness
with
raisin
and
chocolate
malt
flavor
faint
alcohol
finish
this
is
true
liquid
food
taste
gets
thinner
after
each
gulp
twirling
the
beer
in
the
glass
the
beer
resembles
jelly
very
thick
looking
but
does
not
taste
thick
great
beer
would
have
again
worth
trying
if
you
have
access
to
it
very
dark
brown
in
color
and
only
when
held
up
to
light
can
you
tell
that
light
will
make
it
through
a
thin
wisp
of
dark
beige
head
covers
most
of
the
top
of
the
brew
very
active
carbonation
within
aroma
is
very
rich
dark
malt
think
dark
brown
bread
mouth
is
thickcreamyand
a
bit
sticky
flavor
is
heavily
weighted
with
dark
malt
that
lingers
well
into
the
fade
an
epic
representation
of
the
style
and
awful
nifty
that
its
available
year
round
not
overly
alcoholic
at
6
7
which
is
good
because
you
will
want
another
hop
bitterness
is
barely
noticeable
and
serves
well
to
keep
the
sweetness
in
balance
well
done
there
are
hopheads
in
the
universe
i
am
a
malt
head
celebrator
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
the
taste
is
sooo
good

up
the
fridge

repeat
frequently
repeat
because
it
is
worth
it
outstanding
not
sure
what
took
me
so
long
to
try
this
ive
had
several
dopplebocks
but
none
have
had
the
balance
and
complex
array
of
flavor
found
in
this
gold
standard
this
is
a
must
try
overall
this
is
a
very
good
doppelbock
thick
dark
and
well
balanced
with
plenty
of
rich
malts
which
make
it
taste
like
a
meal
in
a
bottle
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style

i
could

and
on

flavors
i
recognize
out
of
this
but
this
beer
is
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
sweet
finish
this
is
not
a
beer
youd
want
to
drink
a
ton
of
its
more
of
a
dessertspecial
occasion
beverage
there
is
no
such
thing
as
the
perfect
beerbut
hey
this
is
close
enough
o
this
was
a
very
well
balanced
beer
flavors
everywhere
and
none
too
dominant
i
can
see
why
this
gets
such
high
marks
overall
this
is
definitely
the
standard
by
which
all
doppelbocks
are
judged
this
is
a
phenomenal
brew
and
is
an
excellent
display
of
brewing
craftsmanship
im
very
pleased
with
this
beer
o
all
told
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
and
one
of
the
most
balanced
and
tasty
of
its
style
o
this
a
a
solid
dark
version
of
a
dobbelbock
this
is
a
drink
that
is
made
for
the
everyman
this
is
the
drink
that
one
would
get
the
shiner
bock
drinker
to
explore
more
into
the
craftmicro
beer
world
o
this
is
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
gets
better
with
each
sip
as
it
comes
to
room
temp
this
is
a
must
try
if
you
havent
done
it
and
i
will
definitely
come
back
to
this
one
it
is
richly
flavored
and
a
bit
sweet
or
sugary
the
with
hints
of
molasses
o
my
first
example
of
the
doppelbock
style
and
i
can
honestly
say
i
dont
think
i
was
ready
for
it
ill
give
it
another
try
in
the
future
perhaps
try
another
example
of
the
style
but
for
me
this
was
far
too
sweet
and
heavy
on
the
palate
if
one
takes
the
brewery
tour
which
is
very
well
arranged
better
be
able
to
decipher
the
german
language
i
thought
the
beer
was
fantastic
smooth
as
your
typical
german
brew
is
but
the
taste
and
freshness
is
second
to
none
and
obviously
drinking
the
beer
right
out
of
the
storage
tanks
doesnt
get
any
more
fresh
and
the
food
was
very
goodtasty
also
probably
the
best
example
of
this
style
i
have
ever
had
i
have
tried
it
on
tap
in
both
germany
and
the
u
s
and
the
bottled
version
retains
most
of
the
complex
set
of
flavors
that
make
this
beer
a
true
world
classic
usually
pretty
affordable
where
i
live
o
amazing
expensive
but
worth
every
penny
as
a
treat
or
early
birthday
present
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
one
of
the
first
i
had
when
i
got
into
drinking
craft
it
has
a
bit
of
something
to
it
that
is
different
than
all
other
doppelbocks
that
ive
had
it
is
very
smooth
in
all
aspects
and
has
a
nice
roasted
touch
to
it
it
is
certainly
the
darkest
doppelbock
ive
found
one
thing
is
that
i
find
many
doppelbocks
have
too
much
of
a
fruitcake
like
flavor
to
me
but
that
is
not
so
with
this
beer
i
try
to
pick
up
a
single
every
few
months
and
am
lucky
enough
to
live
in
a
city
where
a
few
bars
get
it
on
draft
probably
my
favorite
german
beer
o
could
drink
this
all
day
so
so
smooth
exceptional
doppelbock
although
i
am
a
doppelbock
fan
serving
type
11
2
oz
bottle
the
beers
taste
is
smoky
and
darkfruit
sweet
the
aftertaste
is
of
oak
with
the
barest
whisper
of
hops
and
a
wafting
alcohol
volatility
the
beer
feels
satisfyingly
thick
and
smooth
on
the
palate
its
a
nice
choice
for
an
autumn
evening
a
few
steps
this
side
of
a
stout
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
inch
tan

with
decent
retention
smell
is
sweet
with
raisins
plums
and
other
dark

taste
is
sweet
malts
dark
brown
sugar
and
some
of
the
dark
fruits
from
the
nose
medium
body
and
carbonation
overall
a
great
doppelbock
overall
first
time
trying
the
style
but
this
was
glorious
a
great
beer
to
celebrate
with
prost
overall
a
perfect
example
of
a
doppelbock
super
malty
breadlike
quality
and
perfect
mix
of
flavors
o
a
very
good
easy
drinking
doppelbock
but
a
bit
disappointing
considering
its
high
rating
not
a
favorite
i
am
likely
to
buy
again
this
beer
is
perfection
in
every
way
its
rich
and
delicious
smooth
and
forthcoming
it
drinks
sticky
and
has
a
complex
palate
that
has
just
the
right
amount
of
sour
and
bitter
to
offset
its
deep
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
warming
int
he
drink
and
its
easy
to
see
why
this
one
is
the
best
in
the
world
now
this
is
where
i
am
led
to
believe
i
may
have
picked
up
a
bad
bottle
this
tasted
absolutely
awful
up
front
there
was
lots
of
malt
and
caramel
but
the
aftertaste
the
aftertaste
was
just
bad
there
was
just
something
just
not
right
about
it
ive
had
a
few
others
of
this
style
and
enjoyed
them
but
something
was
off
ill
definitely
have
to
pick
up
another
one
sometime
as
i
was
quite
let
down
one
of
the
better
pairings
ive
found
this
is
the
beer
that
has
me
trying
every
doppelbock
i
see
these
days
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
use
to
be
my
favorite
beer
but
quality
has
declined
with
new
owners
can
still
say
to
try
it
if
you
have
not
had
it
it
is
for
a
doppelbock
still
one
of
the
top
10
that
i
have
tried
and
continue
to
see
if
it
will
return
to
being
the
best
but
for
the
price
and
quality
way
overrated
due
the
quality
if
it
was
the
same
as
in
the
past
i
would
again
consider
it
a
great
beer
not
just
above
average
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
i
highly
recccomend
it
a

mouthfeel

soft

somewhat
silky
but
surprisingly
thin
im
a
little
underwhelmed
by
this
one
but
my
expectations
were
pretty
high
a
solid
brew
but
you
can
do
better
in
todays
market
i
first
had
this
in
1987
and
its
not
as
good
as
i
remember
but
at
the
time
it
was
the
best
beer
available
by
far
the
recent
tasting
of
this
beer
was
still
quote
good
however
the
craft
brewers
of
america
have
greatly
improved
upon
it
it
does
remain
a
high
quality
beverage
this
single
330ml
11
2
ounce
bottle
came
with
a
little
white
ram
ornament
that
says
celebrator
on
the
bottom
very
cool
this
doppelbock
style
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
khaki
creamy
head
that
doesnt
last
long
not
much
lacing
around
the
glass
for
this
one
aroma
is
very
pleasing
with
hints
of
molasses
raisins
caramel
and
butterscotch
the
taste
is
the
same
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
as
well
one
of
the
best
that
i
had
in
a
while
for
this
type
poured
into
a
weizenbier
glass
big
threefinger
thick
head
settled
to
a
thin
tawny
layer
that
lasted
to
the
bottom
smell
is
roasty
and
chocolatey
with
some
light
caramel
tones
and
a
bit
of
molasses
the
dark
roast
really
shines
in
the
taste
with
a
slight
bit
of
dark
chocolate
this
is
a
really
bigbodied
beer
very
silky
smooth
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
bocks
out
there
with
a
great
price
a
true
experience
one
that
youll
want
to
really
savor
every
sip
the
6
7
abv
btw
is
every
bit
of
that
the
germans
give
it
to
you
strong
here
i
dont
taste
even
a
hint
of
alcohol
but
23
into
a
little
ol
bottle
11
2
oz
big
i
can
feel
that
6
7
o
i
could
not
drink
this
every
day
because
of
the
sweetness
for
a
sweet
beer
it
rocks
o
i
enjoyed
it
but
it
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
just
failed
to
have
that
it
factor
each
time
i
have
tried
it
but
in
relative
terms
a
very
good
beer
smooth
sweet
and
certainly
worth
the
purchase
i
bought
this
at
the
circle
a
as
a
single
after
perusing
the
top
250
beers
on
ba
and
noticing
i
had
not
yet
rated
one
of
my
favorite
brews
it
was
one
of
the
most
popular
beers
at
my
wedding
as
well
as
one
of
the
imports
that
got
me
into
craft
beer
had
in
10
oz
draft
dark
appearance
with
little
light
penetration
very
smooth
taste
with
malty
notes
little
lacing
and
maybe
1
of
head
drinks
very
clean
and
was
refreshing
when
it
was
90
degrees
out
almost
stoutish
in
its
flavor
would
unquestionably
drink
again
and
probably
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
ive
had
overall
this
is
clearly
a
great
beer
however
for
the
price
there
are
better
beers
at
a
better
value
out
there
though
im
not
sure
if
youll
find
a
better
doppelbock
o
a
very
complex
and
delicious
doppelbock
and
easily
the
best
one
ive
had
no
alcohol
presence
at
all
and
the
plastic
goat
addition
is
icing
on
the
cake
overall
easily
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
o
this
beer
is
an
absolute
treat
complex
balanced
flavors
with
a
full
creamy
body
definitely
a
musttry
i
can
see
myself
getting
this
brew
again
in
the
near
future
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
since
my
first
forray
into
dopplebocks
with
troegs
troegenator
and
im
very
happy
to
say
that
it
doesnt
disappoint
extremely
clean
tasting
without
sacrificing
any
flavor
not
as
high
in
abv
as
others
but
better
overall
in
my
opinion
i
would
get
this
over
paulaners
salvator
any
day
of
the
week
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
a
great
beer
o
this
is
a
really
good
beer
it
tastes
great
and
i
really
like
the
feel
nice
and
malty
and
it
wont
knock
you
down
if
you
have
a
few
in
a
sitting
overall
a
loaf
of
bread
in
a
pilsner
glass
i
now
understand
the
hype
around
this
beer
world
class
beer
highly
recommended
and
the
little
souvenir
is
a
nice
touch
o
im
new
to
doppelbocks
but
this
will
not
be
my
last
i
feel
ive
set
the
bar
too
high
as
this
is
going
to
be
hard
to
beat
this
is
very
complex
with
layers
of
flavor
that
work
in
the
mouth
like
an
escalator
one
after
another
i
can
see
how
other
say
they
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
a
definite
must
have
in
the
cellar
and
a
great
change
of
pace
beer
o
an
interesting
rich
lager
pleasant
to
drink
but
for
me
it
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
surrounding
it
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
celebrate
get
it
i
doubt
that
is
where
the
name
comes
from
but
this
is
such
a
tasty
beer
i
might
buy
another
one
on
my
way
home
tonight
we
are
going
to
some
grand
opening
somewhere
free
appetizers
and
free
drinks
not
sure
what
but
it
should
be
fun
i
dont
even
know
what
the
place
is
called
anyway
i
am
excited
to
try
a
new
bar
and
hopefully
they
have
some
good
cocktails
available
if
not
i
will
leave
and
find
a
bar
offering
celebrator
cheers

roasted

flavor
is
big
licorice
with
hints
of
chocolate
then
more

pretty
sweet
stuff
but
a
lingering
bitter
on
the
palate
very
low
carbonation
thick
mouthfeel
and
heavy
velvety
as
it
describes
interesting
brew
o
this
beer
is
hugely
robust
with
excellent
flavor
the
focus
is
totally
on
the
malt
with
only
a
slight
hop
bitterness
respectable
appearancemuch
darker
than
most
bocks
overall
seriously
this
beer
is
in
contention
for
the
best
ive
ever
had
this
blew
my
hair
back
for
sure
even
my
wife
liked
it
and
she
typically
hates
all
beers
id
buy
this
by
the
gallon
if
i
could
get
it
and
afford
it
unbelievable
o
i
was
very
disappointed
by
the
appearance
the
pour
yielded
some
of
the
quickest
dying
head
i
have
ever
seen
with
no
lacing
luckily
it
was
all
uphill
from
there
beautiful
display
of
malts
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
i
can
imagine
drinking
this
stuff
out
of
a
large
dimpled
mug
at
oktoberfest
good
stuff
o
a
great
beer
well
worth
picking
up
pours
a
pitchbrown
color
with
a
thin
toffee
colored
head
that
sticks
around
for
the
duration
of
the
drink
coats
entire
glass
and
leaves
a
nice
latticework
smells
of
burnt
sugar
maple
syrup
toasted
bread
phenols
a
bit
medicinal
and
of
dark
fruit
perhaps
dates
or
figs
tastes
boozy
on
the
front
of
the
palate
but
it
is
balanced
nicely
in
the
middle
by
the
malted
sweetness
of
residual
sugars
and
caramel
followed
by
a
bready
hopped
twinge
at
the
end
but
it
finishes
smooth
and
stays
thick
throughout
the
whole
tasting
experience
the
balance
and
body
are
perfection
so
smooth
on
the
palate
sticky
chewy
until
the
swallow
this
brew
is
world
class
i
havent
had
many
doppelbocks
but
i
could
tell
from
the
first
sip
that
this
was
something
special
its
very
complex
as
the
esters
phenols
malts
booze
and
hops
balance
perfectly
with
a
thick
chewy
body
on
the
palate
o
a
celebratory
beer
for
sure
easily
my
favorite
doppelbock
and
im
not
a
big
doppelbock
guy
or
anything
but
this
is
an
excellent
beer
reminded
me
of
holiday
ales
and
really
good
brown
ales
taste
is
wonderfully
malty
without
being
too
burnt
toasty
roasty
or
otherwise
bitter
its
so
smooth
and
creamy
malts
are
sweet
but
never
coming
anywhere
near
cloying
there
is
a
kiss
of
herbal
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
as
well
just
the
right
strength
some
doppels
especially
americanized
ones
seem
to
think
they
must
clock
in
at
8
or
9
percent
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
go
back
and
revisit
and
wonder
why
the
hell
it
has
taken
so
long
to
buy
again
this
is
the
best
doppelbock
out
there
when
fresh
i
dont
even
really
think
it
is
debatable
delicious
o
all
of
the
flavors
here
are
in
perfect
harmony
with
one
another
this
is
an
allaround
excellent
double
bock
the
classic
and
archetype
for
the
dopplebock
style
and
one
i
always
enjoy
buy
again
realy
nice
beer
every
bit
as
good
as
i
thought
it
would
be
probably
a
little
more
dark
fruit
character
than
when
fresh
but
that
malt
richness
is
phenomenal
great
maltcentric
brew
a
great
doppelbock
o
big
surprise
here
seriously
awesome
overall
i
would
give
this
an
a
with
some
tendency
toward
a
but
mostly
an
a
it
falls
short
of
being
exceptional
in
my
opinion
for
the
price
it
gets
very
close
however
definitely
the
best
doppelbock
i
tasted
so
far
this
should
please
both
malt
and
hop
lovers
even
though
it
is
perfect
balanced
and
not
a
balanced
over
extremes
no
short
cuts
and
still
a
great
outcome
celebrator
was
a
welldeserved
name
and
this
should
pair
nicely
with
a
broad
range
of
food
especially
meat
or
something
that
can
stand
to
it
really
great
doppelbock
probably
not
the
nest
i
ever
had
but
right
up
there
definitely
try
this
one
great
intro
to
the
style
enjoyed
a
celebrator
tonight
with
a
grilled
flatiron
steak
and
baked
potater
what
a
treat
its
hard
to
imagine
a
better
brew
to
suit
my
taste
although
it
is
such
a
rich
beer
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
sitting
this
beer
has
a
rich
brownishblack
appearance
and
pleasant
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
like
drinking
milk
although
the
taste
is
nothing
like
that
the
taste
is
startlingly
complex
with
so
many
recognizable
pleasant
flavors
all
at
once
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
clean
with
no
distracting
after
taste
it
can
be
matched
but
i
dont
think
ive
had
better
food
pairing
i
had
this
with
some
irish
lamb
stew
and
it
really
goes
perfectly
this
would
also
go
with
some
bananas
foster
as
silly
as
that
sounds
now
a
hamburger
or
some
bratwurst
would
be
really
yummy
maybe
a
pretzel
and
whole
grain
mustard
im
hungry
again
o
oh
this
is
quite
good
definitely
the
best
dopplebock
ive
had
so
far
o
a
very
nice
double
bock
this
hits
the
high
points
hops
and
malt
in
balance
chocolate
flavors
smooth
and
creamy
no
alcohol
taste
just
like
it
should
be
finest
bavarian
double
bock
beer
is
printed
on
the
label
and
is
entirely
accurate
despite
being
low
in
abv
compared
with
many
other
doppels
celebrator
is
head
and
shoulders
above
the
competition
overall
i
must
say
this
is
a
great
beer
the
double
makes
it
stout
like
while
still
retaining
the
caramel
malt
taste
i
like
to
have
this
beer
with
a
big
filet
and
pan
sauce
balanced
to
perfection
this
is
the
doppelbock
to
end
all
doppelbocks
o
very
good
doppelbock
nice
dark
fruits
and
sweet
malts
i
could
drink
a
4
pack
of
this
fairly
easy
over
a
couple
hours
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
not
just
from
a
style
aspect
but
from
the
taste
of
the
beer
itself
i
would
seek
this
one
out
yum
overall
delightful
beer
and
ill
keep
the
little
plastic
souvenir
by
far
my
favorite
beer
it
pours
a
dark
brownishred
and
smells
of
malt
chocolate
and
raisin
the
finish
is
smooth
and
malty
a
tad
chewy
and
flavorful
this
beer
requires
several
sips
to
appreciate
all
the
flavors
its
quite
impressive
how
much
germans
can
do
with
four
ingredients
and
this
beer
is
testament
to
the
strength
of
the
reinheitsgebot
let
them
show
you
a
celebration
live
life
drink
beer
celebrator
is
a
great
winter
time
beer
it
goes
great
with
a
t
bone
steak
with
a
sirloin
steak
round
cut
steak
in
fact
it
goes
great
with
meat
period
i
would
also
recommend
having
a
few
as
a
dessert
heavy
on
taste
and
quality
definitely
worth
a
purchase
t
tobacco
leather
toffee
caramel

a
very

lots
of

and
a
nice

earth

the

lots
of
flavors
for
a

beer
m
clean
and
filling
i
think
we
can
all
agree
this
is
a
definition
of
the
style
o
what
can
i
say
that
hasnt
been
said
by
more
experienced
reviewers
the

everyone
ought
to
regularly

overall
this
is
a

excellent

great
balance
and
complexity
of
robust

flavors
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
as
expected
this
is
the
essential
doppelbock
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
it
is
true
as
true
can
be
to
the
style
and
is
downright
delicious
flawlessly
made
the
pours
is
a
rich
mahogany
to
molasses
color
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
a
few
fingers
tall
excellent
retention
looks
like
a
lot
of
body
and
a
lot
of
malt
character
judging
by
looks
alone
the
nose
is
really
heavy
malt
some
roast
some
caramel
some
dessert
or
bread
pudding
type
of
aromas
and
more
alcohol
than
you
would
think
at
only
6
7
abv
the
flavor
is
really
heavy
dark
wheat
heavy
toasted
barley
and
mineral
rich
water
are
evident
the
yeast
is
also
characteristically
german
bready
and
drenched
in
dark
fruit
there
is
a
peculiar
weight
to
this
that
makes
it
wholly
satisfying
but
may
reduce
drinkability
to
a
certain
degree
its
rich
and
smooth
and
the
carbonation
is
slight
its
a
perfect
early
spring
beer
to
me
and
one
that
would
work
well
with
grilled
meat
a
peppery
arugula
salad
or
even
fresh
baked
cookies
its
not
for
everyone
but
if
you
like
the
style
this
is
the
go
very
robust
and
fullflavored
brew
havent
had
many
doppelbocks
but
this
one
was
certainly
tasty
packed
with
intense
malt
and
sweetness
without
being
cloying
very
impressive
score
may
adjust
once
i
open
up
and
sample
more
and
more
beers
of
the
style
but
this
is
definitely
something
id
like
to
have
again
o
even
though
its
lacking
in
smells
the
taste
and
easy
drinkability
make
up
for
it
and
make
up
for
where
it
lacks
this
is
much
like
a
porter
but
different
at
the
same
time
minus
the
higher
drinkablity
that
comes
from
this
doppelbock
i
definitely
enjoy
this
more
than
a
typical
porter
though
o
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
dopplebock
highly
drinkable
delicious
beer
it
is
the
standard
to
which
all
dopplebocks
should
be
brewed
too
this
is
smooth
on
the
tongue
smoky
sweet
and
dry
theres
a
nice
burnt
malt
flavor
but
offset
by
a
sweet
prune
or
raisin
the
burnt
blends
well
with
the
sweet
and
creates
a
tasty
well
balanced
bock
o
this
is
my
first
doppelbock
and
it
seems
to
be
the
staple
of
the
style
and
it
definitely
lives
up
to
its
rep
a
really
good
and
interesting
beer
o
not
exactly
what
ive
come
to
expect
for
a
doppelbock
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
has
a
distinct
roastiness
and
breadiness
that
is
quite
nice
but
i
could
have
used
more
fruitiness
and
caramel
flavors
i
also
en
o
excellent
representation
of
style
carmel
is
deep
mouth
is
awesome
flavors
are
balanced
very
well
says
finest
bavarian
doppelbock
right
on
the
bottle
this
may
not
be
a
lie
final
grade
4
70
a
nearly
flawless
a
ayinger
celebrator
was
just
what
i
needed
a
doppelbock
to
convince
me
that
i
dont
hate
doppelbocks
i
have
trouble
envisioning
a
more
finelycrafted
bock
than
celebrator
it
really
is
the
gold
standard
the
doppelbock
that
other
doppelbocks
should
aspire
to
be
like
and
an
amazingly
drinkable
strong
lager
that
i
will
definitely
pick
up
again
at
some
point
highly
recommended
to
newbies
as
an
introductory
bock
and
something
worth
stocking
up
on
if
it
isnt
always
available
in
your
area
celebrator
pours
a
bit
short
of
solid
black
as
a
good
amount
of
ruby
highlights
are
easily
appreciable
about
a
finger
and
a
half
of
khaki
colored
foam
crowns
the
beer
and
shows
a
little
bit
of
endurance
lacing
leaves
something
to
be
desired
though
the
nose
is
comprised
of
a
very
nice
blend
of
biscuit
and
toffee
aromas
the
flavor
profile
has
a
bit
more
depth
as
a
light
dusting
of
chocolate
serves
as
a
bridge
from
the
toasty
bread
to
caramel
centerpieces
and
a
subtle
dried
fig
note
appears
during
the
finish
if
at
least
of
those
secondary
characteristics
was
a
bit
more
developed
everything
would
be
just
about
perfect
the
body
is
picturesque
full
and
sturdy
while
remaining
as
far
away
from
viscous
as
a
sub
7
abv
beer
should
carbonation
is
nicely
understated
its
easy
to
see
why
ayingers
celebrator
is
considered
a
classic
version
of
the
style
overall
an
amazing
beer
im
very
happy
to
revisit
i
seem
to
remember
more
pronounced
sweetness
from
the
last
time
i
had
it
a
master
piece
of
its
style
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
flavors
of
raisin
caramel
with
a
buttery
mouthfeel
feels
full
bodied
rich
and
fruity
a
classic
beer
that
is
a
must
try
for
anyone
ayinger
celebrator
doppelbock
is
a
testimeant
that
a
well
crafted
beer
can
be
enjoyed
for
ages
overall
quite
a
tasty
beer
far
too
drinkable
o
this
is
a
great
dopplebock
the
carbonation
is
great
and
would
pear
well
with
a
fatty
pate
andor
cheese
bitterness
to
malt
is
well
balanced
would
definitely
have
this
double
bock
again
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
less
heavy
imperial
stout
o
sweet
baby
jesus
this
thing
smeels
glorious
candied
yams
with
all
the
toppings
roasted
salty
pistachios
and
hints
of
dark
fruit
the
taste
was
much
the
same
but
sadlt
was
a
bit
watered
down
mouthfeel
was
a
little
light
as
well
could
be
an
amazing
session
othis
is
easily
my
favorite
doppelbock
there
is
a
great
balance
of
fruit
booze
and
earthy
flavors
here
all
the
flavors
integrate
well
with
each
other
and
the
beer
is
complex
without
ever
getting
gimmicky
or
unbalanced
the
nearly
perfect
mouthfeel
caps
it
all
off
this
beer
has
some
complexity
but
also
very
unique
boldloud
flavors
more
character
and
depth
but
less
clean
than
most
whatever
im
rambling
here
its
a
fantastic
drink
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
classic
beers
out
there
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
doppelbock
thats
ever
come
close
to
getting
as
many
things
right
as
this
one
does
celebrator
is
a
high
quality
doppelbock
with
a
really
cool
but
gimmicky
advertising
goat
charm
and
great
label
the
beer
matches
the
advertising
and
though
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
would
not
seek
this
one
out
but
would
try
it
if
ever
offered
overall
lives
up
to
the
billing
not
sure
if
i
will
buy
it
again
but
it
definately
passes
the
test
of
a
world
class
doppelbock
o
overall
i
was
expecting
greatness
and
my
expectations
were
exceeded
a
well
balanced
beer
it
was
expensive
but
it
was
worth
it
one
of
the
worlds
delicacies
that
should
be
enjoyed
m
surprisingly
very
thin
little
carbonation
old
world
standard
of
the
style
shapes
the
idea
of
beers
to
follow
its
high
quality
is
evinced
in
every
detail
the
color
is
rich
and
carbonation
is
lingering
yet
always
delicate
in
the
background
oaky
bready
fruity
smell
very
complex
i
cant
put
a
taste
in
terms
unique
enough
to
be
called
its
own
the
mouthfeel
is
warming
and
so
smooth
finish
is
absolutely
perfect
no
gimmicks
here
just
an
expertly
crafted
beer
this
is
rich
and
delicious
from
start
to
finish
plenty
of
rich
malt
carried
through
by
a
delicious
fruitiness
and
roast
bitterness
highly
recommend
it
this
beer
was
a
profound
experience
i
was
at
a
brazilian
steakhouse
on
somebody
elses
check
i
ordered
a
doppelbock
of
some
other
brand
i
didnt
recall
they
told
me
they
had
run
out
of
that
and
that
this
was
the
only
other
doppelbock
they
had
i
said
thanks
and
they
poured
i
have
never
been
a
benefactor
of
such
beautiful
and
just
coincidence
in
my
life
its
like
meeting
your
future
wife
in
a
car
accident
its
like
finding
a
gold
deposit
in
your
basement
after
a
meteor
caves
in
your
house
this
beer
changed
the
way
i
thought
about
life
im
not
exaggerating
i
do
not
know
how
else
to
put
it
just
a
joy
to
find
it
ontap
overall
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
out
there
this
is
probably
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
but
i
can
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
a
nice
malty
cold
weather
beer
and
this
one
really
packs
in
tons
of
flavor
355ml
pours
a
deep
deep
ruby
with
lower
carbonation
and
a
small
dark
tan
lingering
head
aroma
is
black
cherries
coffee
minerals
coffee
taste
is
less
fruity
almost
like
a
smoked
beer
with
tobacco
chocolate
savory
meat
cinnamon
nice
mix
of
roasted
coffee
and
mild
sweet
barbeque
raisins
brown
sugar
black
cherry
soda
and
caramel
come
through
overall
very
drinkable
lighter
palate
neutral
aftertaste
fairly
decent
but
again
this
is
one
of
the
few
decent
doppelbocks
to
be
distributed
stateside
like
almost
all
german
beers
they
dont
hold
up
well
in
the
bottle
need
to
find
this
on
tap
or
stick
with
local
dunkels
in
germany
or
better
yet
pilsnerslagers
the
taste
is
certainly
the
selling
point
leads
off
with
a
burst
of
caramel
that
drops
off
slowly
leading
up
to
an
aftertaste
of
chocolate
and
toffee
these
guys
know
their
malts
pours
deep
brown
with
a
nice
thick
frothy
khaki
head
smell
and
taste
is
pretty
much
straight
up
raisin
bread
minus
the
cinnamon
but
add
some
molasses
flavor
includes
a
nice
creamy
finish
with
a
splash
of
some
cocoa
a
medium
bodied
to
fuller
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
very
nice
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
and
i
will
definitely
try
it
again
o
a
wellattenuated
example
of
the
style
lots
are
very
sweet
this
is
actually
surprisingly
dry
the
earthiness
and
dark
fruits
really
shine
here
excellent
beer
surprising
complexity
in
only
6
7
i
wish
i
could
have
tried
it
side
by
side
with
real
ales
16th
anniversary
dopplebock
would
love
to
compare
them
head
to
head
whew
this
is
one
helluva
beer
this
doppelbock
has
a
malt
profile
unlike
anything
i
have
ever
tasted
one
of
the
most
complexly
balanced
flavors
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
and
without
question
the
best
doppelbock
i
have
gotten
my
hands
on
the
profile
begins
with
a
smooth
hit
of
tangy
molasses
but
directly
before
that
flavor
gets
to
be
too
much
the
profile
shifts
to
a
great
hit
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
twinge
of
alcohol
in
addition
i
got
a
bit
of
what
i
think
may
be
coriander
and
it
was
all
wrapped
up
beautifully
with
a
harsh
smoke
note
and
a
beautiful
caramel
coffee
finish
it
is
not
often
i
find
doppelbock
but
when
i
do
i
snatch
up
every
bottle
i
can
get
my
hands
on
toasty
sweet
malts
deliciously
creamy
body
finishes
dry
an
enjoyable
beer
thats
quite
good
for
the
style
but
definitely
doesnt
deserve
a
spot
in
the
top
100
overall
this
is
one
of
the
finer
doppelbocks
on
the
market
and
while
its
not
one
of
the
strongest
it
is
one
of
the
more
balanced
flavorful
and
allaround
fantastic
examples
available
too
many
beers
sacrifice
the
beauty
of
nuance
and
tempering
for
beatyouoverthehead
hoppinesssugarsalcoholetc
and
its
very
nice
to
see
a
beer
thats
obviously
been
made
by
someone
who
knows
the
supreme
strengths
of
subtlety
and
crafty
understatement
o
rich
smell
to
this
beer
followed
by
an
even
richer
flavor
very
clean
lager
alcohol
is
relaxed
enough
to
let
other
flavors
shine
a
little
lighter
than
expected
sweetness
was
minimal
o
overall
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
doppelbock
ive
ever
had
i
love
this
style
and
am
kicking
myself
for
not
trying
this
one
sooner
i
am
blown
away
and
in
love
with
this
beer
the
nice
balance
of
alcoholderived
and
roastedmalt
flavors
that
one
finds
in
ayingers
celebrator
places
it
among
the
best
representatives
of
the
duppelbock
style
this
is
a
delicious
beer
and
id
gladly
drink
a
more
still
i
hold
out
hope
that
one
day
ill
run
across
a
rendition
of
this
style
that
delivers
at
every
level
this
one
didnt
20
years
ago
the
little
goat
hung
from
the
neck
of
the
bottle
in
a
thicker
red
and
white
intertwined
rope
todays
offering
is
a
pathetic
little
red
string
i
could
floss
my
crowns
with
yes
it
was
noticed
i
still
have
several
of
these
goats
hanging
from
my
der
barons
mug
from
yesteryear
and
this
pathetic
little
note
confirms
the
cheapness
the
old
empires
have
sunk
to
and
20
years
ago
though
i
didnt
like
this
beer
much
id
love
to
find
this
stuff
on
tap
o
excellent
drinkability
state
of
art
german
doppelbock
bready
and
delicious
if
i
had
to
drink
this
as
my
only
meal
i
think
i
could
manage
drinkable
and
smooth
overall
where
do
i
start
this
beer
overwhelms
the
senses
even
by
doppelbock
standards
this
is
a
complex
beer
that
is
loaded
with
personality
i
really
enjoyed
this
lager
overall
a
decent
beer
but
i
think
there
are
other
dopplebocks
just
as
good
at
a
lower
price
o
very
nice
one
of
the
best
not
my
favorite
style
but
if
someone
was
wondering
what
a
doppelbock
tasted
like
this
would
be
it
o
doppelbocks
arent
really
my
thing
if
you
like
them
then
youll
probably
like
celebrator
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
theres
something
about
it
that
isnt
clicking
with
me
o
excellent
beer
but
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
for
the
price
there
are
better
beers
to
be
had
had
this
one
at
a
bar
on
a
chilly
night
and
it
was
great
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
one
its
a
very
good
beer
dark
brown
color
nice
brownish
head
good
retention
smells
of
caramel
dark
fruits
toffee
and
sweet
malty
grains
very
malty
flavor
tastes
of
bread
cherries
carameland
a
bit
of
a
roasted
coffee
character
medium
body
ample
carbonation
great
beer
im
sure
i
will
enjoy
it
even
more
once
i
become
more
acclimated
to
the
doppelbock
style
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
double
bock
beers
it
has
a
milky
smooth
feel
with
a
great
flavor
it
does
not
have
a
hard
hitting
flavor
but
it
keeps
in
a
decent
malty
flavor
that
stays
with
you
after
you
finish
it
the
smell
is
not
intense
but
smells
slightly
sweet
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
any
time
but
is
slightly
heavier
so
i
would
suggest
you
have
it
after
a
meal
o
not
bad
at
all
i
seen
this
beer
a
hundred
times
never
got
around
to
it
until
now
unfortunately
it
is
a
great
beer
but
a
bit
too
hyped
up
for
my
taste
the
price
was
incredibly
reasonable
so
i
jumped
on
it
and
felt
like
trying
something
out
of
the
norm
worth
a
try
but
not
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
overall
nice
dark
malty
sweet
beer
o
one
of
the
references
for
the
style
unfortunately
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
o
gets
good
marks
for
being
practically
the
definition
of
the
style
although
the
aroma
seems
a
bit
off
style
to
me
that
said
maybe
the
style
doesnt
really
appeal
to
me
or
theres
some
intangible
missing
but
it
doesnt
excite
me
at
all
good
though
real
good
o
this
is
pretty
damn
good
tastes
great
balanced
complex
and
way
too
easy
to
drink
i
really
like
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
stout
kindoftaste
of
coffee
caramel
and
dark
chocolate
it
pours
dark
and
is
very
rich
love
the
head
on
this
too
the
smell
of
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
entices
my
taste
buds
very
nicely
yeah
hey
even
the
label
design
is
cool
i
love
this
dopplebock
o
im
rather
indifferent
to
this
beer
style
but
ill
give
it
a
solid
four
o
this
is
a
work
of
art
nothing
is
in
excess
well
balanced
complex
yet
completely
drinkable
expensive
but
worth
it
in
every
way
good
luck
finding
it
overall
theres
not
much
to
knock
here
rich
like
a
belgian
without
the
spice
not
too
sweet
like
an
overblown
wee
heavy
at
a
respectable
6
7
you
can
have
one
or
two
more
because
youre
gonna
want
another
a
real
winner
enjoy
all
doppelbocks
bow
to
celebrator
with
over
2000
reviews
now
there
is
nothing
left
to
be
said
about
it
i
will
say
that
the
one
thing
i
particularly
like
about
celebrator
is
that
despite
its
thick
sweet
flavor
profile
it
doesnt
feel
overly
sticky
or
chewy
which
is
something
other
doppelbocks
ive
tried
would
benefit
from
all
in
all
its
just
a
fantastic
beer
that
quickly
made
its
way
onto
my
top
20
beers
list
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
flavoring
it
was
savory
sweet
and
salty
exhibiting
the
perfect
malts
bill
for
a
doppelbock
there
was
a
great
level
to
the
sweetness
but
an
evenly
mixing
bitterness
for
the
balance
this
beer
is
highly
satisfying
and
an
instant
classic
amongst
any
of
the
german
originals
overall
a
smooth
creamy
beer
liked
the
malty
chocolate
flavor
without
the
bitterness
i
have
had
interesting
results
aging
this
beer
most
bottles
at
2
or
3
years
old
have
lost
some
of
their
intense
malt
and
fruit
flavors
but
have
mellowed
and
integrated
into
an
interesting
malty
bock
some
bottles
lose
most
of
their
flavor
and
are
not
that
interesting
a
few
others
develop
into
a
superb
creamy
malty
uberbock
that
is
very
delicious
most
of
these
bottles
were
from
a
case
that
i
cellared
so
the
differences
are
probably
not
due
to
batch
differences
the
worst
of
these
is
still
ok
to
drink
and
most
are
still
very
nice
so
it
has
been
worth
it
for
the
exceptional
aged
bottles
o
superb
doppelbock
a
textbook
example
of
the
style
yet
unique
to
many
i
have
had
before
i
cant
recommend
this
enough
this
beer
is
without
fault
o
this
beer
is
fantastic
its
smooth
sweet
roasty
savory
and
just
darn
delicious
i
might
be
putting
this
beer
into
my
regular
rotation
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
to
show
someone
i
forgot
just
how
sweet
it
was
honestly
itd
been
years
since
i
had
one
and
back
then
i
was
drinking
shit
beer
so
i
didnt
appreciate
the
style
a
very
sweet
gateway
doppelbock
overall
4
55
very
tasty
overall
this
is
a
little
bit
of
a
disappointment
after
not
having
one
in
about
67
years
i
remember
it
being
better
i
think
my
palate
is
just
better
trained
now
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
easy
to
drink
just
nothing
special
pours
medium
to
dark
brown
with
lighter
brown
edges
where
light
passes
through
this
beer
looks
remarkably
like
a
cola
the
foamy
head
the
carbonation
bubbles
that
accumulate
on
the
side
of
the
glass
and
the
lighter
brown
glints
around
the
bottom
and
edges
of
the
glass
are
reminiscent
of
a
glass
of
brown
cola
the
aroma
is
rich
and
quite
large
horehound
candy
sorghum
prunes
and
heavy
brown
sugar
characterize
the
nose
the
flavor
is
so
big
its
nearly
vulgar
i
said
nearly
there
was
still
quite
a
bit
of
a
tact
employed
in
stopping
just
short
of
over
the
top
it
is
almost
like
drinking
liquid
candy
i
respect
this
beer
for
how
bold
it
is
if
for
no
other
reason
at
all
ive
had
imperial
stouts
and
barleywines
with
less
personality
all
of
this
big
malty
flavor
at
only
6
7
abv
probably
because
the
beer
was
engineered
in
a
fashion
to
retain
more
unfermentable
sugars
i
detect
some
chocolate
liqueur
brown
sugar
and
prunes
theres
just
the
faintest
bitterness
at
the
finish
to
help
offset
the
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
mediumbodied
with
very
little
scrubbing
on
the
tongue
this
is
not
necessarily
a
style
that
id
say
is
in
my
wheelhouse
but
i
do
appreciate
this
beer
i
wish
it
wasnt
14
99
a
fourpack
otherwise
id
keep
it
in
my
fridge
all
the
time
as
an
alternative
to
port
wine
for
an
after
dinner
dessert
drink
overall
tasty
and
well
made
beer
i
can
see
why
this
is
considered
exemplary
for
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
rich
looking
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
fades
quickly
to
nothing
hardly
like
the
overflowing
head
shown
on
the
beers
label
the
nose
has
a
caramel
sweetness
and
subtle
yeastiness
very
little
spice
is
present
as
expected
the
taste
is
rich
and
bready
with
a
lingering
sweetness
there
is
almost
no
bitterness
on
the
back
end
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
there
is
a
slight
fruitiness
reminiscent
of
prunes
followed
by
notes
of
tobacco
medium
bodies
beer
that
feels
heavy
during
this
hot
summer
day
overall
this
beer
is
as
expected
and
a
reliable
doppelbock
not
as
good
as
i
expected
but
still
really
solid
i
think
it
could
use
just
a
little
more
balance
from
the
hops

in

there
is
fullish
penetrating
prune
meat
and
a
luxurious
dry
chewy
earthy
end
bit
of
fizz
in
there
too
absolutely
totally
delicious
and
do
i
detect
an
echo
of
the
classic
taste
of
old
peculier
in
there
as
well
thats
probably
taking
things
a
bit
too
far
but
without
a
doubt
this
deserves
all
the
praise
it
gets
and
then
some
overall
an
excellent

would
love
to
try

a

verdict
solid

from

great
mix
of
flavors
that
strikes
a
great

the
body
leaves
a

to
be
desired
but
make
no
mistake
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
is
artfully
crafted
and
is
one
everyone
should
try
a
hardtotop
doppelbock
my
favorite
and
quite
possibly
the
besttherewillbe
celebrator
is
to
the
doppelbock
what
joe
dimaggio
is
to
the
hitting
streak
its
full
bodied
not
very
bitter
and
in
my
opinion
much
more
carbonated
than
it
needs
to
be
i
wish
i
had
liken
this
more
i
really
do
but
this
one
is
not
for
me
even
if
its
a
beer
whose
technical
merits
are
beyond
discussion
this
is
certainly
the
quintessential
liquid
bread
you
could
almost
make
a
sandwich
out
of
it
its
the
type
of
lager
that
would
surprise
ale
elitists
and
the
type
of
lager
that
makes
me
a
defender
of
the
styles
the
beer
that
eats
like
a
meal
all
i
can
say
is
wow
go
get
one
very
potent
very
sweet
and
a
good
dessert
pour
is
extremely
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
tab
head
and
a
few
large
bubbles
the
nose
has
very
little
roasted
malt
may
e
none
at
all
but
there
is
something
there
akin
lots
of
berry
sweetness
light
bitterness
and
some
marker
the
taste
is
heavy
in
toffee
and
berry
brown
sugar
and
caramel
and
faint
coffee
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
slick
lighter
than
anticipated
nice
carbonation
semi
dry
finish
sweet
but
seemingly
well
attenuated
and
the
bitterness
fades
with
time
toffee
and
berry
start
to
blend
a
touch
singular
but
tasty
o
hands
down
this
is
the
pinnacle
of
the
style
paulaner
salvator
might
be
the
original
doppelbock
but
it
seems
that
celebrator
is
well
the
most
flavourful
its
also
impressive
that
being
so
big
in
flavour
its
less
than
7
in
alcohol
overall
smooth
in
body
and
taste
transitions
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
this
is
one
great
drinking
beer
drank
on

o
this
beer
really
lived
up
to
everything
i
had
been
expecting
for
it
it
was
delicious
well
balanced
complex
but
not
overbearing
and
just
overall
well
presented
overall
i
would
give
the
beer
a
3
7
because
its
not
really
standing
out
from
other
double
bocks
i
have
had
in
the
past
served
on
tap
from
kilted
mermaid
of
vero
beach
fl
for
a
price
of
5
overall
this
beer
defines
its
style
drinkable
but
exciting
smooth
but
aggressive
poured
into
a
chalice
pours
dark
brown
with
a
finger
length
tan
head
that
slowly
dissipates
some
transparency
can
be
seen
around
the
edges
as
well
as
a
few
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
head
dissipates
into
a
nice
cap
of
lacing
atop
the
beer
there
are
faint
smells
of
dark
roasted
malt
molasses
and
some
alcohol
its
bready
as
well
as
malty
sweet
and
i
can
definitely
taste
the
alcohol
in
the
finish
there
is
some
dark
fruit
flavor
as
well
the
flavors
of
dark
fruit
really
open
up
as
the
beer
warms
the
body
is
light
to
medium
and
there
isnt
much
carbonation
in
this
beer
it
looks
like
it
would
be
a
heavy
beer
but
its
not
it
has
a
crisp
and
dry
finish
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
a
very
good
and
drinkable
double
bock
nose
is
malts
dark
fruit
treacle
molasses

alcohol
noticeably
sweet
sweet
and
malty
to
taste

clean
not
sticky
slightly
bitter
burned
toffee
finish
some
woodiness
lots
of
sturdy
flavours
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
o
not
as
flavoursome
as
i
expected
but
damn
smooth
nonetheless
would
rank
as
one
of
my
top
german
beers
found
this
at
mccouls
in
greensboro
north
carolina
its
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
modest
offwhite
head
and
vague
lacing
the
aroma
is
modest
malt
with
a
hint
of
raspberry
sweetness
the
flavor
brings
on
tasty
chocolate
cherry
malt
with
a
light
licorice
undercurrent
that
balances
it
out
very
nice
it
had
mild
carbonation
and
is
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
smooth
feel
in
the
end
this
was
a
fun
brew
and
easily
recommended
as
the
first
dopplebock
i
have
ever
tried
i
must
say
it
is
very
good
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
so
i
was
very
surprised
with
the
flavor
it
has
some
very
complex
flavors
once
it
warms
up
you
get
more
of
the
fruity
notes
for
a
beer
i
chose
at
random
it
turned
out
to
be
a
great
buy
will
definitely
buy
again
ive
drunk
thousands
of
beers
in
my
time
and
generally
it
takes
special
beers
for
me
to
have
an
overwhelmingly
negative
or
positive
reaction
i
have
had
celebrator
in
bottle
and
thought
it
very
good
but
recently
had
it
on
tap
and
was
blown
away
possibly
the
most
enjoyable
three
glasses
of
beer
i
have
ever
had
wont
even
bother
to
rate
the
various
aspects
from
the
initial
sniff
to
final
drop
it
is
one
helluva
beer
sourced
fresh
on
tap
made
a
believer
of
me
rjt
o
honestly
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
crimson
brown
with
a
1
inch
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
and
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
bread
wheatgrain
caramel
and
some
subtle
cocoa
aromas
taste
is
of
dark
wheatmultigrain
bread
caramel
and
some
cocoa
flavors
on
the
finish
i
am
also
getting
some
dark
fruit
flavors
as
the
beer
warms
this
beer
has
a
slightly
crisp
carbonation
level
with
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
very
nice
set
of
flavors
that
work
together
extremely
well
overall
its
kind
of
hard
to
quantify
why
this
beer
is
so
good
but
it
is
its
a
great
german
in
that
its
beauty
is
in
its
complexity
and
restraint
its
pleasant
and
delicious
overall
works
great
as
a
dessert
beer
as
a
session
beer
not
so
much
the
richness
can
get
a
bit
overwhelming
but
when
sipped
and
enjoyed
over
a
decent
amount
of
time
its
quite
rewarding
decent
head
takes
its
time
to
settle
into
a
decent
cap
on
top
of
this
clean
dark
brown
body
with
some
ruby
tinge
smells
are
beefy
dark
fruits
cereals
even
soy
sauce
this
beer
has
an
almost
savory
taste
and
a
good
deal
of
dried
fruits
some
roasted
barley
and
coffee
finishes
crisp
chewy
and
a
little
spicy
definitely
enjoyable
id
like
to
compare
this
one
to
the
troegenator
sometime
this
doppelbock
has
it
all
rich
dark
color
fat
dark
fig
and
date
and
currant
aroma
with
all
the
associated
dark
malt
goodness
in
the
smell
and
taste
additional
tastiness
in
the
bittering
and
excellent
mouthfeel
qualities
i
doubt
i
can
expand
on
any
other
rave
review
of
this
beer
so
ill
just
leave
it
at
one
needs
to
try
this
beer
at
least
once
in
their
life
its
that
good
a
lovely
creamy
mouthfeel
on
this
doppelbock
and
it
has
a
little
fuller
in
body
than
optimator
o
this
beer
is
very
highly
rated
and
deservedly
so
a
really
excellent
german
beer
dark
and
sweet
and
highly
recommended
would
drink
again
easy
drinking
and
rewarding
o
this
is
the
gold
standard
for
the
style
worthy
of
the
good
reviews
and
hype
per
the
style
this
is
damn
near
perfect
rich
and
dark
mahogany
brown
topped
by
two
fingers
of
tan
head
poor
retention
and
very
little
lace
aromatic
notes
of
toasted
bread
raisin
dark
brown
sugar
and
delicate
chocolate
rich
and
malty
up
front
with
note
of
dark
bread
followed
by
dried
fruits
and
light
molasses
flavours
finishing
with
a
mild
bitterness
there
is
a
very
mild
smokey
undertone
to
everything
that
lends
another
level
of
complexity
and
depth
to
this
beer
mediumbodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
velvety
smooth
mouthfeel
very
quaffable
for
its
strength
simply
delicious
high
b
a
o
great
dopplebock
well
worth
the
time
superb
o
complex
amazingly
drinkable
perfectly
balance
many
doppelbocks
tend
to
feel
a
bit
heavy
on
the
stomach
but
this
one
sure
does
not
awesome
beer
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
feel
that
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
people
that
appreciate
porters
this
is
a
beer
you
let
sit
a
little
to
really
bring
out
the
flavor
prost
o
very
nice
complexity
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
and
a
very
consistent
beer
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
over
the
last
5
years
and
always
been
pleased
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
recommend
this
as
a
beer
for
people
new
to
the
style
and
wanting
to
explore
it
i
will
likely
have
many
more
of
these
in
my
ba
experience
o
great
one
of
my
favorite
doppelbocks
overall
warm
taste
with
a
clean
and
crisp
mouthfeel
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
despite
all
the
flavour
and
has
good
balance
great
stuff
o
i
am
a
doppelbock
fan
and
celebrator
is
my
favorite
of
this
type
it
is
always
consistant
available
to
me
the
best
example
of
the
style
because
it
packs
in
big
beer
taste
with
just
enough
alcohol
kick
to
make
it
fun
this
is
the
point
of
a
doppelbock
prost
o
the
way
i
see
it
if
this
is
like
a
brilliant
painting
of
the
last
supper
then
troegs
troegenator
is
like
an
ordinary
but
well
executed
painting
of
monica
belucci
i
can
really
appreciate
the
artful
precision
that
went
into
making
this
but
id
take
the
monica
belucci
painting
instead
likewise
though
it
isnt
as
complex
as
celebrator
id
rather
have
troegenator
dont
get
me
wrong
though
this
is
a
great
beer
either
way
overall
an
easy
drinking
doppelbock
just
wish
is
looked
a
bit
better
d
its
a
very
good
beer
though
its
a
bit
of
a
let
down
given
the
current
ratings
considering
its
availability
and
quality
though
its
a
good
choice
excellent
see
ya
on
the
next
one
o
certainly
deserving
of
its
praise
this
is
a
doppelbock
to
be
reckoned
with
and
a
shining
beacon
of
the
style
hv
drinkability
it
is
a
very
solid
brew
mister
goat
ornament
and
myself
could
easily
enjoy
this
throughout
lent
o
this
beer
is
very
awesome
the
flavor
is
what
throws
me
overboard
the
flavors
are
just
so
perfect
and
i
dont
know
of
another
doppelbock
that
compares
a
decent
beer
i
suppose
but
the
dark
fruit
notes
were
a
bit
dominate
for
my
liking
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
o
there
is
a
reason
this
is
a
world
class
beer
it
is
very
tastey
and
the
consistency
in
ones
mouth
matches
the
taste
topquality
dark
beer
a
musttry
definitely
worth
a
try
and
comes
highly
recommended
cheers
o
awesome
dobbledock
smooth
and
flavorful
and
went
down
way
too
easy
pours
a
very
pure
and
dark
brown
with
a
slight
lighter
brown
head
awesome
color
to
this
beer
aroma
of
burnt
sugar
molases
vanilla
toffee
just
a
bunch
of
malty
goodness
flavor
surely
follows
molasses
burnt
sugars
and
caramel
malts
lead
the
way
some
more
subtle
dark
fruit
notes
and
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
close
this
one
out
really
malty
really
sweet
but
strong
without
being
overpowering
overall
amazing
incredibly
complex
honestly
had
trouble
finding
words
to
describe
some
of
the
nuances
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
perfect
doppelbock
has
never
been
one
of
my
preferred
styles
but
this
one
would
easily
sit
alongside
my
favourite
beers
complex
perfectly
balanced
and
too
drinkable
this
bottle
disappeared
i
wish
i
had
a
case
of
this
around
for
the
winter
o
a
very
excellent
example
of
the
style
sweet
and
rich
without
going
overboard
a
dessert
beer
but
a
complex
one
that
makes
you
stop
and
think
about
what
flavors
youre
getting
not
quite
as
good
as
i
remember
it
being
the
prominent
maltiness
seems
toned
down
somewhat
will
have
to
give
it
another
shot
in
the
future
enjoyed
from
pilsner
glass
pours
with
an
appearance
much
like
cola
with
a
ruby
red
tinge
good
head
that
doesnt
last
too
long
brightly
sweet
malty
smell
some
fruits
cherry
being
one
and
some
cinnamon
and
ginger
very
full
flavored
grassy
smokey
burnt
malts
coffee
a
little
booze
and
bitterness
in
the
finish
smoothest
and
creamiest
of
its
kind
that
ive
had
both
are
wonderful
beers
and
the
ayinger
is
something
i
will
be
drinking
again
o
easily
one
of
the
best
dopplebocks
ive
had
the
interplay
between
the
caramel
roasted
malt
and
biscuit
is
a
treat
id
probably
enjoy
this
the
most
in
the
cool
lateautumn
months
overall
just
a
world
class
beer
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
as
a
go
to
beer
for
about
a
decade
now
and
i
will
never
stop
drinking
this
i
absolutely
love
this
and
recommended
it
and
it
is
hands
down
the
best
dopplebock
on
the
planet
notes
a
very
malty
backbone
very
hearty
the
drinkabilty
of
this
is
very
good
a
dam
tasty
meal
in
a
bottle
cheers
pours
much
darker
than
i
was
expecting
almost
black
but
when
held
to
the
light
it
is
a
very
nice
darkdark
brown
with
just
a
touch
of
ruby
around
the
edges
with
a
nice
tight
two
finger
light
tan
head
tons
of
sweet
caramelization
molasses
and
bread
up
front
with
some
dark
fruits
right
behind
it
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
perfect
balance
of
warming
alcohol
and
just
enough
hop
bitterness
to
cut
through
the
primarily
sweet
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
on
this
one
is
absolutely
insane
probably
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
definitely
worth
seeking
out
it
presents
itself
as
a
whole
unit
with
every
part
working
together
to
create
a
wonderful
experience
if
you
are
going
to
try
only
one
doppelbock
make
it
this
one
definitely
one
of
the
worlds
finest
beers
overall
i
can
see
the
reason
for
the
high
ratings
on
this
one
i
have
not
had
a
doppelbock
that
could
come
close
amazing
beer
o
i
havent
had
many
dopplebocks
but
i
cant
imagine
any
better
then
this
a
really
great
beer
that
is
easy
to
get
o
a
real
treat
complex
and
absolutely
delicious
will
definitely
have
this
again
and
again
and
again
o
overall
its
a
really
good
beer
it
is
what
a
doppelbock
is
i
would
recommend
it
to
another
person
and
would
drink
it
again
i
dont
pick
up
much
nose
from
this
beer
and
the
taste
is
not
very
complex
or
rich
as
id
want
it
to
be
its
still
a
good
beer
o
i
dont
have
a
ton
of
experience
with
doppelbocks
but
this
is
quite
enjoyable
smoother
drier
less
fizzy
creamier
subtler
deeper
yet
less
intricate
and
darker
if
thats
even
possible
with
some
age
any
sharpness
from
fruit
is
gone
in
the
3
5
year
old
bottle
leaving
lots
of
round
artisanal
chocolate
notes
edging
towards
a
scotch
ale
reminds
of
how
laying
down
double
bastard
knocked
all
the
rough
edges
off
at
the
same
time
the
tartness
and
hopes
in
the
fresh
bottle
did
serve
to
keep
it
from
cloying
probably
improving
drinkability
overall
d
nice
and
easy
to
drink
yet
having
nice
taste
and
character
wouldnt
replace
a
good
stout
for
me
when
looking
for
a
dark
beer
but
i
enjoyed
this
o
enjoyable
beer
would
recommend
it
this
is
well
balanced
beer
that
you
dancing
with
every
sip
i
challenge
anyone
to
find
a
better
example
of
the
style
o
wow
just
try
it
great
doppelbock
pours
a
deep
brown
with
some
clarity
through
light
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
going
down
smells
fantastic
with
aromas
of
brown
bread
caramel
and
chocolate
flavor
is
very
smooth
and
well
put
together
tastes
of
coffee
dark
chocolate
roasted
malts
with
some
alcohol
warmth
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
terrific
beer
o
deserving
of
the
recognition
it
receives
a
winter
classic
for
me
o
widely
regarded
as
one
of
the
top
doppelbocks
out
there
and
imo
it
has
earned
the
recognition
notes
just
plain
good
and
drinkable
i
would
be
concerned
that
the
heavy
maltiness
might
become
tiring
over
a
session
taste
like
a
roaring
fire
in
a
glass
full
across
the
palate
more
raisins
tons
of
maltback
is
there
seriously
any
alcohol
here
impossibly
well
blended
mouthfeel
is
tremendous
exceptional
representative
of
the
style
cherry
cola
color
hazy
and
thick
with
a
decentlysized
tan
head
that
recedes
quite
a
bit
but
still
leaves
a
good
coating
of
lace
on
the
glass
malty
aroma
caramel
roast
cocoa
and
dark
fruits
taste
of
sweet
malts
and
caramel
roasted
grains
and
nuts
raisins
and
figs
a
touch
of
chocolate
maltdominant
but
i
still
pick
up
a
faint
hoppiness
in
the
finish
mediumbodied
flavorful
and
highly
drinkable
o
this
is
a
very
nice
and
complex
doppelbock
overall
a
very
good
beer
glad
i
tried
it
i
will
get
again
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
fellow
bas
overall
this
is
one
heck
of
a
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
period
coming
from
a
hophead
any
lager
this
interesting
flavorful
intense
smooth
and
rewarding
as
this
is
worth
noting
at
first
smell
it
was
hard
for
me
to
imagine
ever
having
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
its
actually
quite
drinkable
for
a
robust
sweetish
lager
this
is
a
worldclass
example
of
a
doppelbock
overall
there
are
not
too
many
double
bocks
out
there
that
i
tend
to
frequent
time
and
time
again
but
this
specific
brew
always
leaves
me
wanting
more
a
very
rich
malty
beer
that
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
it
is
quite
bold
in
its
approach
and
if
you
happen
to
like
belgian
quads
you
may
find
this
beer
to
be
a
great
way
to
mix
things
up
although
quite
different
and
much
more
chocolaty
it
has
the
thick
and
heavy
body
of
a
rich
belgian
quad
and
the
darker
characteristics
of
a
porter
overall
this
beer
is
completely
different
from
trappiste
rochefort
10
but
a
magnificent
beer
nonetheless
o
ayingers
celebrator
is
an
awesome
beer
simple
as
that
its
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
full
of
interesting
and
complex
flavors
its
a
world
class
beer
and
an
example
of
how
great
a
lager
truly
can
be
run
dont
walk
to
go
pick
this
up
i
wanted
to
do
something
special
for
my
100th
review
i
think
i
made
a
terrific
choice
what
an
awesome
beer
easily
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
its
smooth
and
easydrinking
but
never
boring
definitely
not
a
session
beer
this
baby
is
a
dessertinabottle
its
meant
to
be
savored
this
is
a
great
brew
i
will
be
looking
forward
to
more
of
these
throughout
the
winter
drinkability
overall
complex
and
mellow
a
true
liquid
bread
but
it
needs
more
carbonation
to
balance
the
flavors
and
create
a
fuller
feel
definitely
a
world
class
example
of
this
style
both
a
pleasure
to
look
at
and
to
drink
overall
a
really
great
doppelbock
probably
my
favorite
overall
lager
o
very
good
dopplebock
always
love
this
one
o
what
a
dank
beer
super
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
yet
it
has
all
of
the
big
malty
flavors
and
bready
sweetness
will
definitely
be
drinking
again
o
buy
this
beer
drink
it
enjoy
what
most
beers
should
aspire
to
be
only
avoid
this
if
you
cant
stand
anything
dark
or
lagers
t
is
an
explosion
of
flavours
sweet
and
bitter
warming
on
throat
rich
malt
flavour
it
has
an
impression
of
attenuation
o
this
beer
is
everything
a
doppelbock
is
meant
to
be
a
big
rich
beer
that
definitely
fits
the
liquid
bread
moniker
a
damn
near
perfect
example
of
the
style
that
being
said
its
not
my
favorite
doppelbock
but
i
respect
it
for
its
characteristics
mnotes
theres
a
reason
dopplebocks
work
as
meal
replacements
and
this
brew
highlights
why
people
can
go
weeks
consuming
nothing
but
this
beer
the
flavors
are
delicious
the
complexion
is
satisfying
i
try
to
keep
this
around
as
much
as
possible
poured
a
dark

almost
opaque
fairly
dense

a
thick

with
a

some
toasted
dark
breadcereals
some
chocolate
toffee
and
light

notes
loads
of
malt
flavour
no
alcohol
on
the
palate
but
catches
up
after
a
couple
of
bottles
smooth
sticky
and
drying
body
and
finish
opens
up
and
really
becomes
something
else
at
around
room
temp
didnt
understand
the
comparison
to
liquid
bread
until
i
actually
got
into
this
really
warming
and
essential
drinking
for
the
cooler
months
i
generally
dont
like
more
malt
forward
brews
so
i
doubt
ill
go
back
to
this
one
often
but
for
the
style
it
is
pretty
good
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
complexity
but
its
still
good
i
could
drink
this
all
year
long
but
it
is
perfect
for
cool
fall
evening
o
such
a
brilliant
beer
if
you
have
not
had
this
go
get
some
taste
was
similar
but
not
quite
as
good
roasted
malt
sweetfruity
bit
of
molasses
wasnt
the
best
thing
ive
ever
tasted
but
definitely
still
a
good
beer
i
enjoyed
trying
it
tastes
are
good
and
alright
but
nothing
spectacular
i
also
expect
a
bit
more
out
of
a
doppelbock
this
bottle
aslo
has
some
age
to
it
though
and
is
almost
a
year
old
now
so
maybe
some
of
the
flavors
have
died
down
oh
well
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch

is
very
malty
some
caramel
taste
is
good
malts
caramel
some
fruits
very
flavorful
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
be
careful
with
this
abv
this
beer
is
very
easy
drinking
and
quite
good

very
good
example
of
a
doppelbock

chocolate
and
dark

in
the

not
a
bad

quite
new
to
the
doppelbocks
ogood

of
a

i
found
really

i
hadnt
tried
this
before
its
really
enjoyable
well
carbonated
good
mouthfeel
overall
very
solid
a
truly
great
doppelbock
it
tasted
of
raisins
yeast
slight
grappy
taste
kind
of
similar
to
aventinus
from
schneider
but
not
as
good
i
dont
think
its
as
wonderful
as
advertised
but
a
decent
beer
cool
bottle
with
a
souvenir
plastic
goat
aruond
the
neck
looks
like
coke
with
a
tiny
head
and

not
especially
impressive

bittersweet
aftertaste
lingers
slightly
this
is
pleasant
but
extremely
overhyped
i
would
not
jump
through
hoops
to
get
it
excellent
brew
ill
be
picking
up
a
few
more
of
these
to
hold
on
to
over
the
course
of
the
winter
o
high
quality
beer
the
best
doppelbock
out
there
the
finish
may
be
my
favourite
aspect
of
this
beerdry
and
crisp
making
it
oh
so
drinkable
rich
and
fullbodied
with
average
carbonation
creamy
mouthfeel
a
nice
balanced
complex
classic
example
of
the
style
overall
a
highly
regarded
and
deserving
doppelbock
satisfying
beer
all
round
o
the
best
dopplebock
that
will
ever
be
made
d
fantastic
doppelbock
that
i
will
be
revisiting
in
the
near
future
could
easily
drink
this
throughout
the
night
plus
this
label
is
easily
a
5
0
o
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
ive
had
not
typically
a
fan
of
this
style
but
this
is
a
nice
brew
for
a
cold
fall
evening
d
a
beautifullycrafted
doppelbock
with
interplay
between
nose
taste
and
mouthfeel
that
makes
for
a
sensual
experience
im
getting
another
one
for
the
cellar
come
hell
or
high
water
poundforpound
ayinger
is
as
good
a
german
beer
as
any
curator
is
the
only
dbock
ive
enjoyed
more
but
thats
beers
staggering
strength
isnt
always
appropriate
celebrator
is
no
sissy
it
just
drinks
so
easily
and
is
so
versatile
theres
no
fault
in
treating
it
as
your
winter
session
beer
taste
lots
of
dark
dried
fruit
particularly
figs
and
raisins
sweet
brown
bread
roasted
barley
grain
and
alcohol
o
great
flavor
profile
on
this
and
thats
coming
from
someone
who
isnt
a
big
raisin
fan
overall
its
very
well
balanced
would
definitely
buy
again
plus
each
bottle
comes
with
this
awesome
little
plastic
statue
of
their
logo
which
will
hang
on
my
fridge
or
possibly
xmas
tree
for
many
years
to
come
o
lived
up
to
the
high
expectations
a
great
fallwinter
beer
abv
is
warming
but
i
could
still
sit
back
and
drink
a
few
of
these
od
a
good
one
but
lacking
doesnt
live
up
to
the
aroma
still
good
and
tasty
but
i
would
only
have
one
very
enjoyable
beer
this
celebrated
brew
did
not
disappoint
and
i
will
grab
an
armful
whenever
it
hits
the
shelves
its
not
my
favourite
doppelbock
doppelhirsch
is
but
this
is
a
truly
excellent
beer
that
is
a
musttry
for
fans
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
glad
i
got
a
few
overall
definitely
a
world
class
beer
that
is
a
must
try
its
very
drinkable
and
my
glass
was
empty
before
i
knew
it
looking
forward
to
drinking
more
of
it
during
the
colder
weather
and
holiday
season
moreys
bottom
line
ive
had
this
one
before
but
it
had
been
a
while
i
wont
wait
this
long
again
very
good
fall
beer
too
imo
if
youre
a
fan
of
malty
beer
this
is
a
must
try
o
to
be
honest
i
had
never
even
thought
about
trying
this
beer
before
i
did
the
naked
pint
beer
tour
so
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
vault
to
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
of
all
time
i
could
drink
this
beer
anytime
delicious
overall
great
beer
that
is
definitely
more
interesting
and
rewarding
than
salvator
which
is
still
a
very
good
beer
esp
the
aroma
definitely
a
sipping
beer
its
so
thick
and
chewy
that
you
couldnt
drink
it
fast
if
you
tried
plus
even
if
you
could
pound
it
back
the
alcohol
would
smack
you
around
shortly
after
finishing
im
not
a
big
fan
of
doppelbocks
but
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
overall
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
experience
o
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
and
lives
up
to
its
reputation
perfect
for
a
cold
fall
night
if
you
havent
tried
this
yet
what
are
you
waiting
for
doverall
this
is
a
very
nice
doppelbock
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
this
style
but
i
def
like
this
one
and
will
search
out
more
from
this
style
deep
brown
with
ruby

quite

very
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
great
german
dopplebock
i
love
the
heavy
malt
aroma
and
flavor
i
wouldnt
drink
this
all
the
time
but
definitely
enjoy
it
when
i
do
cheers
overall
a
super
thick
rich
and
creamy
beer
that
is
filling
and
delicious
can
stand
alone
or
pair
well
with
a
host
of
foods
delicious
ive
had
this
doppelbock
many
times
ive
tried
others
but
always
come
back
to
celebrator
its
the
gold
standard
doppelbock
readily
available
consistent
and
awesome
every
time
o
i
like
me
some
doppelbocks
and
this
guy
deserves
the
hype
not
the
biggest
or
boldest
but
absolutely
nothing
bad
to
say
and
a
lot
good
to
say
about
it
overall
another
good
dopplebock
much
maltier
and
smokier
than
the
paulaner
salvator
overall
an
excellent
doppel
bock
not
quite
as
outstanding
as
the
weihenstephaner
korbinian
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
o
4
this
was
a
great
beer
i
love
trying
another
great
classic
o
delicious
doppelbock
i
cannot
wait
for
my
next
celebrator
as
it
is
a
cause
for
celebration
i
have
to
admit
that
i
havent
had
many
dopplebocks
but
this
is
a
great
one
its
very
malty
full
of
flavor
without
being
extreme
in
any
way
this
reminds
me
i
need
to
figure
out
if
there
is
a
reason
why
each
bottle
comes
with
a
plastic
goat
o
what
can
i
say
that
hasnt
already
been
said
about
this
one
a
rich
powerful
brew
that
is
warming
but
nothing
near
boozy
full
flavors
full
bodied
very
nice
looking
and
pleasant
smelling
this
one
has
it
all
i
am
sure
this
set
and
continues
to
be
the
standard
for
the
style
and
i
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
is
a
beer
lover
this
is
definately
worthy
of
getting
picked
up
again
very
good
double
bock
overall
definitely
tasty
but
drinkability
isnt
high
for
me
one
and
im
done
deepest
brown
with
a
well
structured
tan
head
heavily
malted
with
fig
toffee
biscuits
caramelized
sugar
and
raisin
all
present
hops
take
the
smallest
edge
off
the
maltiness
and
lend
a
faint
earthy
spice
warming
but
not
boozy
in
the
least
so
much
malt
packed
into
less
than
7
abv
something
american
brewers
have
yet
to
master
a
benchmark
for
the
style
and
the
little
goat
charm
that
comes
on
the
bottles
is
icing
on
the
cake
o
awesome
doppelbock
simply
enjoyable
i
would
take
this
any
day
vs
any
american
offering
of
a
germanstyle
beer
o
really
a
great
beer
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
complex
compact
and
absolutely
delicious
worth
a
look
worth
seeking
out
this
is
a
beer
that
could
should
be
a
staple
in
any
beer
drinkers
life
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
nice
frothy
tan
head
on
top
smells
of
caramel
coffee
molasses
and
cocoa
nice
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
some
hop
bitterness
coffee
dark
roasted
malts
bread
cocoa
this
beer
is
very
good
and
it
comes
with
a
plastic
little
goat
thing
on
the
bottle
strong
carmelized
sugars
and
malt
dominate
the
tastebuds
some
aftertaste
of
coffee
hops
are
more
of
a
presence
in
this
doppelbock
than
others
which
makes
it
a
bit
more
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
this
pours
a
very
dark
brown
basically
blackish
color
with
a
thick
and
creamy
tan
mocha
head
the
smells
are
of
figs
prunes
molasses
and
tons
of
malts
feel
is
medium
to
thick
a
little
creamy
the
taste
is
like
it
smells
lots
of
malts
almost
too
much
no
real
hop
balance
but
this
is
probably
right
for
the
style
i
get
a
little
banana
some
dark
fruit
and
lots
of
molasses
this
is
pretty
thick
and
sweet
im
only
just
starting
to
like
these
malt
bombs
so
ill
have
to
try
this
again
in
a
few
months
i
like
it
more
every
time
i
get
it
the
taste
was
also
very
sweet
and
like
figs
it
had
some
hops
to
balance
it
but
not
quite
enough
giving
it
sort
of
a
taste
that
i
associate
with
the
smell
of
the
cat
food
i
used
to
give
my
cats
so
im
not
really
a
fan
but
it
was
an
alright
decent
beer
i
dont
usually
ever
say
a
beer
is
overly
sweet
because
i
like
sweet
beers
but
sometimes
they
just
are
and
this
one
was
too
sweet
that
is
pours
a
dark
brown
w
a
nice
chocolate
head
nice
head
and
lacing
very
dark
a
virtual
black
hole
ok
carbonation
nose
is
hops
malt
chocolate
dark
fruit
taste
is
fairly
similar
to
the
smell
very
good
feel
is
a
nice
malt
vs
hops
vibe
fantastic
beer
and
really
good
for
the
style
o
very
easy
to
drink
lots
of
great
qualities
about
this
beer
never
had
this
style
before
so
nothing
to
compare
it
to
very
well
done
perhaps
could
be
a
bit
fuller
in
the
body
and
mouth
feel
a
very
different
unique
style
overall
great
brew
if
it
wasnt
for
the
price
i
would
be
buying
these
all
the
time
this
is
a
great
introduction
to
the
finer
heavier
lagers
overall
not
as
impressed
as
i
thought
id
be
after
all
the
hype
a
good
sipping
beer
nonetheless
my
wife
too
kept
coming
back
for
more
pairs
well
with
cheddar
ram
on
little
celebrator
o
a
really
nice
beer
this
is
why
i
feel
like
a
trip
to
germany
is
in
order
beers
like
this
have
been
around
for
hundreds
of
years
and
it
shows
in
nearperfection
it
makes
me
happy
that
they
export
o
very
complex
sweet
and
savory
my
wife
kept
coimg
back
for
multiple
sips
which
is
unusal
needless
to
say
i
very
good
beer
odoverall
a
pretty
awesome
doppelbock
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
can
clearly
tell
why
this
is
the
michael
jordan
of
doppelbocks
just
a
fantastically
crafted
beer
d
super
drinkable
doppelbock
an
interesting
style
not
extreme
with
fruit
malt
sweet
flavors
but
more
of
a
marriage
of
everything
together
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
but
strong
lager
i
love
this
beer
i
am
glad
it
is
so
widely
available
this
is
the
go
to
doppelbock
its
also
a
beer
to
reflect
on
to
slowly
savour
and
appreciate
the
miracle
of
life
and
beer
o
havent
had
many
beers
of
this
style
but
this
one
sets
a
high
bar
for
any
others
wish
it
was
sold
in
pack
where
i
live
remarkable
brew
with
a
substantial
dosage
of
flavor
very
important
for
any
lover
of
this
style
to
pick
this
up
for
a
try
o
good
beer
but
nothing
fancy
best
doppelbock
ive
had
though
overall
probably
one
of
the
top
five
beers
ive
had
outstanding
i
think
ill
have
me
another
i
like
this
a
lot
unlike
my
favourite
the
andechs
doppelbock
this
is
distinctly
fruitier
and
a
touch
lighter
its
good
had
this
beer
served
with
a
german
meal
my
glass
had
a
rich
dark
almost
opaque
brown
color
with
a
small
head
but
good
lacing
it
was
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
it
tastes
a
lot
lighter
than
it
looks
the
flavors
increase
as
the
beer
warms
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
would
order
it
again
im
glad
i
encountered
this
classic
double
bock
and
look
forward
to
drinking
it
many
more
times
in
the
future
just
an
outstanding
beer
and
another
classic
european
beer
that
i
should
buy
much
much
more
often
like
aventinus
weinstephaner
rochefort
10
etc
so
happy
its
very
available
a
benchmark
of
the
style
still
the
only
doppelbock
i
like
as
much
would
be
the
andescher
a
very
drinkable
beer
which
is
actually
not
overly
sweet
like
so
many
other
doppelbocks
o
nothing
earth
shattering
but
its
a
good
beer
very
easy
drinking
and
complex
considering
the
ingredients
not
the
top
of
my
dopplebock
list
but
will
defiantly
keep
in
mind
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
just
a
touch
of
reddish
tint
and
a
small
amount
of
tan
head
the
nose
is
toasted
malts
dark
fruits
raisin
plum
and
a
bready
yeastiness
big
and
malty
this
succeeds
where
other
doppelbocks
fail
by
being
not
too
sweet
for
what
it
is
a
strong
dark
fruit
component
with
malts
that
are
tamed
a
bit
and
nice
dark
fruit
and
bready
components
this
actually
reminds
me
of
dr
pepper
a
bit
but
not
as
carbonated
and
obviously
not
nearly
as
sweet
pretty
big
body
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
winner
overall
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
and
it
shows
what
a
doppelbock
can
be
when
the
sweetness
is
toned
down
a
touch
overall
i
absolutely
despise
doppelbocks
this
is
a
good
beer
thats
all
that
need
be
said
overall
amazing
and
well
balanced
dopplebock
absolutely
loved
it
worth
the
3
bottle
yes
o
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
bit
heavier
for
the
style
tasty
sweet
malts
but
didnt
stand
out
for
me
for
the
style
i
will
definitely
pick
some
of
this
up
again
someday
for
now
ill
just
have
to
display
the
bottle
with
the
little
ram
trinket
o
this
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
i
would
like
to
see
how
a
six
pack
would
do
over
a
nice
dinner
a
world
class
beer
it
is
overall
one
of
the
best
of
the
category
i
plan
on
collecting
every
ram
trinket
i
get
o
this
one
is
very
sweet
but
it
has
plenty
of
flavors
going
on
to
keep
you
interested
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
the
best
dopplebock
i
have
ever
had
but
it
is
up
there
overall
this
is
just
a
really
great
doppelbock
and
when
im
in
the
mood
for
the
style
this
is
the
one
ill
be
grabbing
for
overall
a
beautiful
beautiful
beer
that
probably
tastes
better
to
me
now
after
finishing
a
ton
of
work
its
absolutely
wonderful
and
completely
delicious
i
wish
i
could
say
more
about
it
but
its
too
good
to
keep
waiting
to
be
finished
as
i
type
here
highly
recommended
a
world
class
recipe
right
here
clear
medium
brown
body
with
tan
head
quick
dissipation
with
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
malty
nose
mostly
caramel
with
some
roasted
malt
taste
is
tres
complex
caramel
some
burnt
brown
sugar
and
a
huge
dark
stone
fruit
presence
more
prunes
than
raisins
balanced
by
floral
hops
mouthfeel
is
on
the
full
side
of
medium
pretty
rich
sticky
finish
we
started
the
tasting
with
this
and
everyone
thought
this
was
the
gold
standard
not
the
most
drinkable
of
beers
very
filling
re
meal
replacement
but
the
relatively
low
abv
for
this
style
adds
to
the
allure
of
this
world
classic
overall
this
is
perhaps
the
defining
version
of
the
style
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
every
day
but
if
you
want
a
doppelbock
this
is
what
youre
looking
for
overall
solid
brew
no
faults
not
a
big
or
intense
beer
it
was
more
mellow
than
i
was
expecting
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
will
certainly
have
again
after
all
of
these
years
of
that
little
white
hanging
goat
beckoning
me
i
have
finally
succumbed
a
steady
pour
into
a
sa
perfect
pint
glass
yielded
a
a
good
2
fingers
of
creamy
smooth
offwhite
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
good
amount
of
time
beer
was
a
nice
oaken
brown
color
smelled
of
leather
toasted
malts
molasses
a
bit
of
sweet
dark
dried
fruit
seemed
almost
quadesque
sans
the
spicy
yeast
taste
was
big
with
the
roasted
sweet
malts
prunes
chocolate
raisin
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
was
full
creamy
with
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
sustained
taste
progressively
smoother
taking
on
more
licorice
chocolate
and
bing
cherry
characteristics
over
time
without
losing
its
maple
brown
sugar
goodness
a
craver
every
few
months
you
will
have
a
craving
for
a
celebrator
one
would
be
shocked
at
how
many
goat
pendents
i
have
o
though
i
already
had
a
review
of
this
beer
but
nevertheless
i
still
love
it
if
it
werent
for
the
price
tag
this
would
constantly
be
in
my
fridge
without
a
doubt
sadly
this
was
my
last
one
o
very
happy
that
i
decide
to
give
this
a
try
this
complexity
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
i
will
be
picking
this
up
again
taste
is
exquisite
heavy
body
malty
rich
and
distinctive
hints
of
dried
fruit
molasses
very
tasty
and
worthwhile
ive
never
been
much
a
fan
of
bocks
but
this
is
the
best
ive
had
easily
will
be
enjoying
again
overall
drinkability
good
enjoyable
hardcore
session
beer
guess
thats
why
they
call
it
celebrator
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
sting
with
each
sip
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
the
complexity
makes
it
very
interesting
the
flavors
fit
together
very
well
and
it
is
pretty
drinkable
for
the
complexity
definitely
a
great
brew
ran
across
this
without
really
looking
for
it
but
knew
i
had
to
pick
it
up
ill
definitely
be
looking
for
it
in
the
future
sweet
molasses
followed
by
malty
mouth
feel
crisp
grass
freshness
and
finishing
with
grape
wine
notes
slightly
dry
a
very
nice
double
bock
overall
very
impressive
dopplebock
tried
a
bunch
of
others
and
never
got
around
to
this
one
but
happy
that
i
did
definitely
worth
its
top
dopplebock
status
why
oh
why
did
i
wait
so
long
to
try
this
stellar
brew
this
brew
poured
up
a
hefty
dark
mahoganycolored
body
with
a
thick
onefingered
tan
colored
with
retention
lasting
long
after
the
beer
was
gone
and
amazing
lacing
effects
aromas
of
warm
dark
bread
caramel
molasses
malts
and
hops
and
a
very
slight
hint
of
alcohol
of
the
doppelbocks
i
am
sure
that
this
one
reigns
supreme
mediumbodied
light
carbonation
very
thick
and
creamy
with
a
wellbalanced
hit
of
hops
on
the
finish
that
is
dry
but
not
too
dry
the
body
here
is
somewhat
full
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
malt
bomb
maybe
not
the
best
choice
for
a
90
degree
night
but
im
enjoying
the
heck
out
of
it
anyhow
malt
heads
youll
love
this
if
you
dont
already
recommended
by
my
local
brewery
bartender
and
boy
he
really
hit
it
on
this
one
beautiful
dark
brown
color
just
a
bit
of
light
gets
through
excellent
caramel
smell
with
a
hint
of
fruits
maybe
mouth
feel
is
amazing
silky
smooth
and
very
inviting
for
another
sip
taste
is
nothing
short
of
exceptional
excellent
to
enjoy
right
after
dinner
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
time
and
time
again
an
excellent
representative
of
its
style
hence
its
name
celebrator
great
beer
to
celebrate
celebrator
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
ive
had
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
really
deep
reddish
brown
color
the
head
was
average
sized
but
had
a
good
retention
to
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
of
rich
caramel
notes
with
some
strong
malt
aromas
the
smell
is
a
little
warming
and
inviting
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
had
many
of
the
elements
that
were
on
the
nose
it
was
sweet
upfront
which
faded
into
a
nice
caramel
bitterness
in
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
really
well
balanced
between
thickness
and
carbonation
overall
i
feel
that
its
a
must
try
this
beer
is
near
perfect
would
gladly
drink
this
anytime
best
doppelbock
ive
enjoyed
to
date
by
far
this
is
a
great
beer
that
tastes
delicious
and
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
for
how
robust
it
is
great
suggestion
from
a
trusty
bartender
the
celebrator
pours
a
fluffy
coarse
head
which
fades
to
thin
lace
great
exemplar
of
the
style
as
its
full
bodied
but
light
on
the
finishno
syrupy
or
winey
overproduction
here
color
is
a
translucent
chestnutred
brown
nose
is
burnt
toast
mouthfeel
is
silky
tastes
like
toasted
oak
by
which
i
mean
the
flavor
that
you
get
from
overoaked
california
chardonnays
but
in
the
celebrator
a
good
thing
so
vanilla
burnt
sugarglaze
and
im
serious
krafts
dark
milkmaid
caramels
but
without
the
sweetness
finish
is
long
and
dries
reminding
you
that
this
is
a
beer
nice
carbonation
for
this
style
as
well
o
overall
a
very
good
offering
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
this
one
was
damn
good
and
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
i
expected
certainly
a
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
again
taste
well
malty
and
wonderful
and
dark
and
gah
must
find
someone
with
this
on
tap
within
100
miles
its
that
good
id
drive
100
miles
for
a
pint
right
now
my
daughter
loves
the
little
plastic
goatbock
that
comes
tied
around
the
neck
of
these
bottles
o
the
gold
standard
of
dopplebocks
and
the
perfect
example
of
the
style
worth
trying
because
it
is
so
epic
this
is
a
top
notch
beer
when
it
comes
to
doppelbocks
this
one
is
king
the
nose
was
the
only
thing
that
left
me
wanting
this
beer
can
serve
in
so
many
functions
i
consider
it
one
of
the
best
possible
beers
to
cook
with
its
exceptionally
well
balanced
between
malt
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
plenty
of
spice
to
it
as
well
but
not
so
much
that
it
throws
it
off
balance
in
fact
it
enhances
the
balance
i
dont
rave
like
this
about
many
beers
this
one
is
simply
great
o
an
amazing
brew
from
a
very
very
old
brewery
i
loved
everything
weihenstephaner
produced
and
this
is
no
different
amazing
taste
that
is
far
from
being
overwhelming
with
exceptional
balance
overall
id
stop
short
of
naming
this
the
worldbeater
that
i
kind
of
expected
but
that
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
its
an
excellent
beer
i
can
hardly
wait
sampled
from
a
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
dark
brown
in
color
with
reddish
hues
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
poured
with
a
brief
offwhite
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
thin
wisps
and
no
lacings
sweet
dark
fruit
aromas
fig
raisin
with
sweet
molasses
and
dark
caramel
malt
fuller
bodied
with
tight
carbonation
smooth
up
front
with
a
slight
resinous
feel
toward
the
end
dark
malt
and
sugary
molasses
flavor
throughout
with
a
bit
of
bitter
hoppiness
showing
up
in
the
middle
through
to
the
end
finishes
with
a
touch
of
heat
and
lingering
malty
sweetness
o
this
is
a
very
complex
style
so
much
going
on
the
the
aroma
and
taste
i
will
need
to
have
a
bad
beer
in
this
style
to
better
weight
my
ratings
i
know
now
that
this
style
isnt
for
me
to
sweet
for
me
o
what
a
delightful
beer
i
would
definitely
get
another
for
a
special
occasion
definitly
a
celebration
in
a
glass
drink
so
flavorful
but
retains
a
small
quality
balanced
flavorful
not
a
palate
wrecker
or
tries
to
be
what
its
not
ill
come
back
to
this
beer
a
lot
one
of
the
best
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
faint
reddish
highlights
and
a
2
finger
beige
head
that
turns
to
a
nice
bubbly
lace
and
stays
with
the
the
beer
the
whole
way
down
smells
of
roasted
coffee
beans
bitter
sweet
chocolates
sour
apples
and
grapes
and
pear
juice
sweet
chocolates
and
fruits
are
sandwiched
in
between
a
big
mouthfull
of
bready
malts
and
a
smooth
coffeecoca
bean
finish
awesome
slight
friendly
alcohol
presence
can
also
be
found
towards
the
end
of
a
sip
creamy
velvety
smooth
on
the
feel
with
a
nice
big
body
extremely
enjoyable
delicious
wish
i
could
give
it
all
5s
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
minimal
light
making
its
way
through
it
also
poured
a
23
finger
tan
head
that
quickly
receded
the
smell
is
slightly
sweet
almost
caramelized
with
some
roasted
malt
hints
as
well
the
flavor
is
mildly
sweet
with
a
good
roasted
malt
backbone
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
decent
carbonation
overall
this
is
my
favorite
doppelbock
d
delicious
malty
doppelbock
with
a
lovely
balanced
flavour
profile
hint
of
chocolate
creaminess
in
the
finish
balances
the
toasty
malt
and
makes
it
wonderfully
smooth
excellent
overall
disappointed
initially
blown
away
by
the
time
i
finished
m
as
noted
earlier
creamy
smooth
texture
with
mild
carbonation
medium
to
thick
body
leaves
the
mouth
feeling
sticky
like
i
just
ate
a
stack
of
pancakes
and
syrup
o
hands
down
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
so
incredibly
well
rounded
and
unique
any
time
i
have
the
chance
to
have
one
i
take
it

bloody
nice

flavor
next
oh
wow
so
much
going
on
here
very
hard
to
describe
the
complexity
of
this
brew
there
is
a
definite
appearance
of
a
bourbon
flavor
here
but
it
is
offset
by
the
roasty
bitterness
im
shocked
why
the
hell
havent
i
been
drinking
dobblebocks
all
along
this
is
an
amazing
brew
i
now
forgive
the
germans
for
their
shortsighted
reinheitsgebot
laws
mouthfeel
this
is
perfection
drinkability
for
6
7
there
is
no
alcohol
feeling
here
this
is
just
amazing
overall
are
you
kidding
me
this
is
my
5th
time
coming
back
to
this
beer
one
of
top
doppelbocks
ive
ever
had
would
suggest
to
anyone
trying
the
style
i
may
not
be
able
to
drink
more
than
one
but
its
still
fantastic
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
im
not
sure
what
the
meaning
behind
celebrator
is
but
it
fits
well
with
this
beer
its
not
something
you
would
knock
back
while
watching
the
game
this
is
a
beer
for
special
occasions
even
an
after
dinner
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
this
one
is
the
exception
a
model
brew
for
the
style
not
to
mention
kickass
bottle
art
and
packaging
just
amazing
a
perfect
combo
of
flavors
and
aromas
ive
yet
had
a
doppelbock
thats
even
close
to
this
classic
overall
this
is
quite
an
excellent
beer
and
an
enjoyable
way
to
spend
an
afternoon
if
you
are
a
fan
of
big
malty
beers
this
one
should
be
on
your
list
to
try
overall
wow
what
a
doppel
bock
tons
of
flavors
using
only
the
basic
ingredients
to
make
a
beer
nothing
artificial
or
anything
added
will
keep
this
in
mind
if
i
am
ever
at
fat
heads
again
tasty
o
overal
this
is
a
great
beer
considering
it
only
uses
water
hops
malt
yeast
it
is
very
complex
a
standard
among
doppelbocks
330
ml
bottle
pours
a
very
dark
brown
that
looks
like
cola
when
held
up
to
the
light
two
finger
tan
head
that
has
good
retention
and
never
completely
disappears
leaves
a
huge
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
brown
sugar
a
light
nuttiness
roasted
malt
molasses
and
a
yeasty
breadiness
the
initial
taste
is
a
sweet
nuttiness
with
a
good
amount
of
roast
brown
sugar
is
also
present
along
with
molasses
the
finish
has
some
more
nuttiness
and
breadiness
as
well
as
a
light
bitterness
mediumheavy
body
relatively
low
carbonation
could
probably
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
very
smooth
o
the
goat
has
been
hanging
from
the
stick
in
my
jeep
for
years
because
this
is
a
beer
to
remember
so
enjoyable
from
start
to
finish
the
doppelbock
brilliant
in
its
simple
complexity
d
drink
easy
with
a
slight
booze
finish
the
aroma
is
what
you
think
of
when
you
think
beer
it
is
a
complexity
of
carmel
and
chocolate
with
a
tiny
hint
of
herbs
not
yeasty
at
all
the
color
was
a
very
rich
dark
reddish
brown
that
when
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
cascaded
back
into
itself
for
about
30
seconds
as
the
head
built
to
a
good
2
and
the
great
flavor
makes
you
want
to
just
keep
drinking
it
overall

it
is
slightly
better
then
bells
and
weihenstephaners

to

cant
believe
i
have
never
had
it
before
ill
be
looking
forward
to
the
next
time
i
drink
it
brewers
will
make
a
lot
of
claims
about
the
superiority
of
their
beer
on
labels
typically
these
should
be
taken
with
a
heaping
tablespoon
of
salt
however
for
ayinger
to
call
celebrator
the
finest
double
bock
beer
is
no
exaggeration
it
is
unequivocally
undeniably
the
golden
standard
of
the
style
any
attempts
to
replicate
it
or
even
to
honor
it
only
serve
to
advertise
that
fact
and
endorse
the
superiority
of
its
brand
d
this
is
a
really
filling
brew
so
it
might
better
serve
as
dessert
than
something
you
drink
all
night
o
whenever
someone
tells
me
a
product
is
the
best
of
its
kind
i
am
rightfully
skeptical
but
this
is
without
a
doubt
is
the
best
in
the
world
a
true
work
of
art
gute
arbeit
deutschland
this
is
a
great
beer
the
smell
is
creamy
vanilla
the
chocolate
barley
really
comes
through
in
the
taste
very
flavorfull
yet
smooth
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
i
was
shocked
at
the
drinkability
there
is
almost
a
molassis
flavor
that
goes
well
with
the
rich
dark
hocolate
flavor
overall
considered
by
most
to
be
the
quintessential
doppelbock
and
it
lives
up
to
its
reputation
find
a
four
pack
and
enjoy
with
friends
t
rich
and
bready
with
a
lot
of
malt
sweetness
molasses
a
hint
of
smoke
and
a
touch
of
hops
and
a
bit
of
spiciness
in
there
as
well
really
nice
this
is
simply
an
outstanding
beer
all
around
i
could
imagine
the
taste
being
a
bit
deeper
or
more
complex
but
ive
certainly
never
encountered
such
a
beer
simply
the
best
doppelbock
ive
had
bar
none
wow
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
ruby
tones
showing
in
the
light
the
aroma
begins
with
chocolate
and
has
hints
of
nuts
and
toast
the
flavor
is
extremely
well
balanced
with
chocolate
raisin
and
nutty
notes
with
a
bit
of
maple
in
the
finish
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
is
quite
drinkable
ayinger
celebrator
doppelbock
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
outstanding
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
a
pretty
amazing
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
to
like
nearly
as
much
as
i
did
i
think
most
beer
drinkers
will
be
pleasantly
surprised
by
it
as
well
overall
an
outstanding
brew
i
dont
drink
doppelbocks
too
often
but
i
will
definatly
pick
this
up
more
often
i
really
liked
both
beers
and
after
doing
the
side
by
side
i
think
the
great
lakes
version
deserves
a
little
more
credit
than
it
gets
that
said
celebrator
is
much
better
in
the
bottle
than
on
draft
imo
and
it
is
ultimately
the
better
beer
o
pretty
great
medium
complexity
heavy
and
rich
its
not
an
everyday
beer
which
is
the
point
i
think
d
the
beers
mouthfeel
hurts
overall
drinkability
but
this
is
a
solid
sipper
pours
a
dark
ruddy
brown
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
dark
malt
and
dark
fruit
i
am
curious
to
see
how
this
will
turn
out
now
taste
was
a
bit
of
a
punch
in
the
mouth
for
me
the
smell
got
me
going
but
the
taste
didnt
land
for
me
i
found
it
to
be
thick
and
rich
definitely
a
lot
of
flavor
with
the
molasses
and
dark
fruits
coming
in
strong
overall
i
dont
think
ill
seek
this
out
again
until
i
have
a
greater
appreciation
for
it
o
very
good
dopplebock
easy
to
drink
had
2
could
have
had
another
no
problem
pours
a
nice
creamy
tan
2
finger
creamy
head
which
fades
to
a
nice
cap
and
thick
ring
of
lacing
smells
hugely
of
malts
brown
sugar
raisins
touch
of
sweet
alcohol
very
nice
smell
tastes
very
malty
sweet
raisins
carmel
toffee
red
sweet
grapes
a
touch
of
earthy
hops
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
very
drinkable
for
the
6
7abv
3
for
a
single
next
time
ill
get
a
4
pack
this
stands
up
to
all
the
talk
and
then
some
check
this
one
out
for
sure
i
dont
think
that
i
would
buy
it
again
anytime
soon
but
i
did
enjoy
this
glass
and
i
have
3
more
to
drink
or
add
to
my
beer
cellar
poured
out
what
i
thought
was
jet
black
but
looking
closer
it
has
an
extremely
deep
red
hue
with
a
tan
head
that
has
a
solid
thickness
that
also
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
rich
and
earthy
figs
dates
and
some
robust
red
grapes
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
metallic
tang
the
initial
taste
has
a
large
amount
of
molasses
flavored
sweetness
with
some
of
the
fig
and
dates
notes
some
of
the
grape
flavors
linger
around
like
wine
esters
finishes
with
some
chocolate
bitterness
and
a
mild
fruit
complexity
a
slight
dryness
but
not
enough
to
make
you
pucker
d
sum
is
better
then
the
parts
i
am
not
a
huge
doppelbock
fan
but
this
one
was
nice
sweet
as
expected
but
roastiness
sets
against
it
nicely
complexity
with
the
sweet
fruit
overall
a
great
doppelbock
more
bold
than
most
very
drinkable
not
my
favorite
style
but
easily
the
best
doppelbock
on
the
market
overall
this
an
excellent
doppelbock
that
is
near
the
top
of
its
class
overall
this
is
one
the
beers
that
is
shown
off
as
the
dopple
bock
and
for
good
reason
i
love
to
give
this
beer
to
people
who
think
that
all
beer
is
just
bitter
or
hoppy
the
taste
is
just
as
sweet
as
the
nose
would
suggest
this
brew
is
thick
and
delicious
but
the
sweetness
is
nicely
balanced
by
a
grainy
characteristic
celebrator
is
a
fullbodied
and
viscous
beer
but
not
so
much
to
make
it
unenjoyable
this
brew
is
very
good
in
my
book
this
beer
was
a
perfect
complement
to
smoked
herring
if
you
really
want
a
meal
in
a
glass
find
one
of
these
d
an
incredible
beer
i
could
easily
have
3
or
4
of
these
in
a
night
a
superbly
balanced
brew
that
keeps
you
wanting
more
d
this
is
almost
a
perfect
beer
so
rich
and
complex
definitely
the
best
of
the
style
that
ive
tried
just
wish
the
price
didnt
match
the
quality
d
4
while
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
and
experience
of
this
brew
i
couldnt
see
myself
wanting
any
more
than
a
couple
at
a
time
that
said
it
is
a
smooth
and
wellcrafted
product
but
it
was
just
a
little
onedimensional
for
me
good
brew
nonetheless
d
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
sweet
malty
flavors
a
hint
of
caramel
and
some
dark
fruits
coming
through
give
this
beer
good
flavor
for
anyone
up
for
a
change
of
pace
from
ipas
i
highly
recommend
this
tasty
brew
an
exceptional
beer
i
am
a
big
dopplebock
fan
and
this
one
is
at
the
top
of
the
list
and
among
my
top
beers
overall
wish
i
had
tried
this
sooner
d
smooth
perfectly
balanced
a
true
pleasure
to
drink
d
complex
drinkable
and
overwhelmingly
malty
the
fruity
notes
blend
very
well
with
the
caramel
and
toffee
and
give
the
beer
a
level
of
complexity
that
lasts
through
the
finish
smooth
and
extremely
pleasant
this
is
a
classic
example
of
the
style
that
i
could
easily
drink
all
night
first
sip
is
quite
nice
with
a
nice
caramelized
dark
malt
flavor
its
bitter
and
malty
and
clean
all
at
the
same
time
with
an
absolutely
classic
aftertaste
and
being
made
for
the
standards
of
the
reinheisgebot
makes
it
an
that
much
more
interesting
as
a
beer
hands
down
my
favorite
doppelbock
its
really
that
good
overall
one
of
the
best
brews
i
have
ever
tasted
i
sampled
this
years
ago
and
have
to
say
it
still
tastes
as
good
as
i
remember
definitely
in
my
top
10
give
me
a
trogenator
over
this
but
not
by
much
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
this
is
quite
worthy
of
being
among
the
highest
rated
beers
of
its
style
in
the
world
amazing
flavor
for
a
lager
beer
cracks
my
personal
top
15
list
for
sure
which
means
ill
always
have
this
on
hand
in
my
fridge
an
a
ranking
from
me
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
great
drinkibility
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
it
is
a
great
bock
beer
this
is
the
best
german
beer
ive
had
period
i
plan
on
buying
a
few
4
packs
of
this
because
i
am
seriously
impressed
great
drinkablity
and
at
6
7
abv
one
should
check
himself
before
he
wrecks
himself
on
this
bock
the
mouthfeel
is
great
although
something
does
not
feel
quite
right
about
it
to
me
while
it
is
almost
too
flavorful
to
be
incredibly
drinkable
overall
impression
excellent
doppelbock
classic
and
tasty
overall
i
was
hoping
for
more
out
of
this
beer
it
certainly
makes
sense
that
i
did
not
love
it
since
i
am
a
hop
head
and
celebrator
is
all
malt
definitely
too
sweet
and
thick
for
me
to
love
but
it
does
have
some
good
flavors
d
very
unique
and
enjoyable
both
of
these
greatly
aid
the
drinkability
here
ive
picked
this
one
up
before
and
ill
pick
it
up
again
a
great
example
of
the
style
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
sweetness
is
well
balanced
unlike
some
other
doppelbocks
ive
tried
d
pretty
drinkable
for
the
style
i
think
bottle
purchased
earlier
today
at
premier
gourmet
in
buffalo
pours
a
dark
brown
colour
with
thick
offwhite
head
the
head
dissipates
to
just
under
a
finger
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
chocolate
and
raisin
with
toasted
grains
some
small
bitterness
in
the
flavour
to
go
with
a
lot
of
sweetness
this
has
a
fairly
smooth
mouthfeel
certainly
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
ive
had
if
not
the
best
trust
me
you
need
to
try
this
its
worth
getting
exceeds
the
reputation
dark

it
that
puts

celebrator
pours
an
inviting
mahogany
with
a
thin
tan
head
theres
a
malty
must
in
the
smell
with
some
spice
in
the
background
very
similar
flavors
in
the
taste
its
full
of
malt
but
is
subtly
sweet
bread
and
just
a
kick
of
spice
at
the
back
aftertaste
of
some
chocolate
and
hazelnut
its
smooth
creamy
and
amazingly
drinkable
nose
is
nutty
and
roasty
hints
of
caramel
and

body
is

with
a

finish
dusty

fill
out
the
body
which
is
not
nearly
as
thick
or
sticky
as
some
in
the
category
relying
more
on
the
smooth
dryness
hides
the
abv
well
but
could
be
a
little
heftier
without
harming
the
beer
complex
and
incredibly
drinkable
this
is
a
favorite
that
i
wish
was
locally
available
d
a
solid
doppelbock
not
as
great
as
rating
and
hype
would
have
suggested
though
very
good
but
not
world
class
d
incredibly
complex
flavors
absolutely
delicious
and
a
picture
of
heaven
when
poured
into
a
bottle
this
is
truly
among
the
great
beers
of
the
world
this
is
a
great
beverage
its
kind
of
thick
so
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
too
many
of
them
but
i
could
definitely
enjoy
a
few
atmosphere
is
great
here
dark
intimidating
appearance
with
a
really
solid
foamy
head
and
some
decent
lacing
nose
is
simple
but
exceptional
flavor
is
perfect
balance
of
grain
sweet
and
spice
notes
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
not
exactly
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
certainly
a
worthy
beer
later
i
found
out
that
this
beer
is
25
on
beeradvocates
top
100
beer
list
drinkability
very
drinkable
doppelbock
the
tastes
seem
to
come
together
well
and
has
a
nice
aftertaste
with
a
fruity
finishwell
blended
and
balanced
beer
poured
into
a
snifter
this
is
the
best
looking
doppelbock
ive
ever
seen
it
pours
a
thin
rich
mahogany
in
color
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
which
quickly
dissipates
the
aromas
are
very
bready
theres
slugfest
of
yeast
and
malt
with
some
caramel
and
brown
sugar
and
it
is
pretty
mild
overall
it
tastes
of
malted
barley
brown
sugar
molasses
and
bready
yeast
it
also
has
some
subtle
dark
fruits
to
it
it
drinks
really
well
and
is
light
to
medium
in
body
it
has
good
crispness
and
goes
down
smoothly
this
is
an
excellent
doppelbock
definitely
worthy
of
its
ranking
the
taste
is
near
perfectionone
of
the
smoothest
beers
ive
had
especially
considering
the
6
7
abv
dark
roasted
bready
malts
nuttiness
chocolate
coffeereally
just
a
complex
and
impressively
drinkable
beer
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
i
recommend
not
drinking
it
too
chilled
as
it
masks
a
lot
of
the
flavor
thats
the
best
thing
about
the
beer
is
that
each
sip
is
better
than
the
last
anyhow
i
recommend
this
doppelbock
to
any
beer
drinker
unquestionably
worth
the
14
for
a
fourpack
all
and
all
a
fantastic
beer
d
can
a
doppelbock
get
any
better
i
think
not
drinkability
this
is
a
great
beer
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
in
the
future
better
as
it
warms
remarkably
so
this
is
a
beer
i
almost
dismissed
as
i
started
it
but
by
the
end
i
wanted
another
pours
dark
brown
good
finger
of
white
foam
resides
on
the
top
dark
fruity
smell
some
malt
taste
is
clean
and
smooth
almost
like
a
scwarzbeir
sp
with
fruity
tones
smooth
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
quite
tasty
solid
brew
d
overall
a
tasty
offering
but
i
certainly
didnt
have
the
same
experience
as
some
of
the
other
bas
i
much
prefer
trois
mousquetaires
doppelbock
and
am
inclined
to
try
this
again
in
a
head
to
head
challenge
a
little
disappointed
but
ill
pick
up
another
in
the
event
that
my
bottle
was
dated
or
off
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
if
the
sweetness
didnt
get
to
me
definitely
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
for
sure
drinkability
this
is
the
best
doppelbock
ive
ever
tasted
i
cant
wait
to
have
another
a
bit
more
expensive
than
its
competition
it
still
provides
excellent
value
because
it
is
just
so
much
better
simply
a
terrific
brew
the
cpj
d
very
drinkable
well
balanced
great
flavor
and
nice
finish
highly
recommended
very
easy
to
drink
a
perfect
friend
on
a
cold
rainy
day
the
color
was
a
dark
ruby
brown
on
the
nose
you
could
discern
dates
with
roasty
notes
initial
raisin
like
taste
with
a
semisweet
second
taste
ending
in
a
smooth
nonbitter
finish
left
a
faintly
sweet
after
taste
that
sat
well
in
your
mouth
well
rounded
beer
perfect
for
a
cold
winter
evening
it
was
a
mellow
well
balanced
brew
i
love
it
and
hey
the
bottle
is
cool
looking
too
pours
a
phenomenal
looking
dark
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
fades
away
leaves
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
toffee
caramel
and
sweet
malt
taste
is
primarily
of
sweet
malt
with
the
toffee
and
caramel
evident
with
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
sticky
drinkability
is
great
as
this
beer
washes
down
quite
easily
d
lots
of
flavor
here
cant
taste
the
alcohol
this
is
a
good
beer
for
sipping
on
its
own
extremely
well
bodied
and
rich
giving
a
sense
of
fullness
when
completed
i
wish
protein
shakes
tasted
like
this
poured
from
bottle
into
a
stein
one
of
my
favorite
german
doppelbock
beers
pours
a
deep
dark
ruby
appearance
aroma
is
very
full
with
brown
sugar
candied
figs
caramel
and
a
touch
of
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
very
heavy
with
plum
and
dark
bread
a
really
nice
doppelbock
first
it
pours
a
deep
dark
garnet
color
with
a
light
beige
head
the
smell
of
it
is
both
malty
and
fruity
the
malty
sugary
smell
make
up
the
great
majority
of
the
aroma
with
the
caramelized
sugar
notes
but
the
stars
of
the
show
are
the
clove
and
slight
banana
notes
that
are
present
as
if
a
wonderful
mild
belgian
yeast
fairy
dropped
it
into
this
smooth
doppelbock
the
taste
takes
some
getting
used
to
still
as
there
is
an
acidic
malt
flavor
that
does
tend
to
ruin
what
is
a
wonderful
malty
and
clovelike
taste
the
mouthfeel
of
this
particular
beer
is
pretty
damn
smooth
while
it
isnt
the
easiest
drinking
beer
that
ive
ever
had
its
pretty
darn
near
the
top
10
i
truly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
have
no
problem
purchasing
it
again
in
the
future
d
fully
drinkable
worldclass
doppelbock
a
musttry
d

i
havent
been
buying
this
much
since
they
nearly
doubled
the
price
good
but
i
still
believe
its
overrated
if
you
arent
a
diehard
american
ipa
fan
then
celebrator
is
your
brew
if
you
appreciate
quads
or
any
other
belgians
as
i
do
then
you
can
find
a
place
in
your
heart
for
this
beer
despite
its
relative
bitterness
compared
to
other
beer
of
its
style
at
first
i
had
my
doubts
but
celebrator
is
truly
world
class
theres
no
denying
perfection
but
be
careful
once
you
try
it
theres
no
going
back
the
drinkablity
on
this
brew
is
pretty
good
as
well
i
could
probably
session
this
beer
with
out
a
problem
but
others
might
have
a
problems
with
such
a
thick
brew
this
was
one
amazing
dobbelbock
no
wonder
its
found
on
the
top
100
brews
of
ba
d
an
amazingly
bold
and
flavorful
beer
not
a
great
deal
but
its
so
good
i
would
quickly
pick
this
one
up
again
overall
excellent
beer
overall
arguably
the
best
doppelbock
in
the
world
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
buy
it
dthis
is
a
great
complex
beer
the
complexity
slightly
runs
together
as
the
beer
goes
on
but
the
beer
leaves
me
wondering
i
feel
like
im
missing
something
like
theres
more
to
the
beer
and
i
need
to
have
it
again
to
see
what
else
i
can
find
in
it
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
it
never
seizes
to
amaze
me
the
complexity
of
the
malt
is
outstanding
a
fantastic
comfort
beer
smooth
mouthfeel
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
excellent
offering
havent
had
many
dopplebocks
but
this
is
one
delicious
beer
it
is
no
surprise
to
me
that
it
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
this
style
drinkability
what
an
enjoyable
beer
with
all
of
the
craft
beer
movement
focused
on
ales
it
is
nice
to
have
such
a
wonderful
lager
beer
to
enjoy
that
being
said
i
am
so
happy
i
gave
this
a
shot
it
was
a
great
deep
brown
with
a
fizzy
head
the
scent
was
heavily
malted
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
caramel
it
is
a
smooth
drinking
beer
and
highly
enjoyable
not
too
sweet
great
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
sweet
banana
at
first
with
mild
carbonation
turning
into
a
good
simple
brown
bread
light
milkshake
wetviscosity
feel
and
some
light
faint
milk
chocolate
as
well
this
is
a
great
finishing
drink
and
a
fantastic
tasting
beer
id
have
another
in
a
heartbeat
drinkability
im
not
ordinarily
a
doppelbock
drinker
but
this
is
just
phenomenal
extraordinarily
happy
to
have
finally
tried
this
this
one
is
a
delicious
rich
malt
driven
beer
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
them
but
damn
is
this
tasty
pours
to
a
generous
beige
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
ring
and
light
lacing
color
is
deep
rubybrown
and
is
very
clear
aroma
is
very
malty
and
rich
flavor
is
a
nice
blend
of
snappy
munich
malts
caramelized
malt
decoction
and
noble
hops
for
balance
this
is
a
fine
doppelbock
in
terms
of
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
co2
is
good
for
the
style
overall
i
would
say
this
beer
is
a
fine
representative
of
the
style
and
a
joy
to
drink
celebrate
a
world
class
beer
i
fell
in
love
with

connoisseur
the

is
good
beer
buy
it
as
a
gift
for
any
friend
or
family
member
whom
appreciates
good
beer
and
they
will
truly
be
greatful
for
introducing
them
to
this
creation
smooth
yet
strong
beautiful
to
look
at
and
very
easy
to
drink
malty
and
earthy
scents
exceptional
flavor
balance
yet
quite
complex
and
unique
drinkability
is
just
awesome
only
wish
it
was
cheaper
to
purchase
paired
with
a
typical
italian
dish

cui
cudich
in
milanese
dialect
stewed
beans
with
pork
rind
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
split
i
really
could
not
get
into
this
beer
but
it
probably
is
great
if
you
like
this
style
i
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
head
but
then
everything
goes
down
for
me
tastes
and
smells
way
too
smokey
and
i
did
not
find
this
to
balance
well
with
the
caramel
maltiness
that
much
overall
i
found
it
just
too
thick
and
not
very
drinkable
for
what
it
was
d
nice
dopple
just
as
it
should
be
drinkability
this
beer
may
be
a
bit
advanced
for
my
amateur
palate
and
nose
this
brew
has
a
lot
of
different
characteristics
honestly
it
was
not
that
easily
drinkable
for
me
this
is
probably
a
brew
i
will
have
to
try
again
in
a
few
yrs
first
doppelbock
i
have
ever
tried
and
it
was
a
bit
overwhelming
d
if
you
enjoy
a
sweetened
malty
concoction
then
this
is
the
brew
for
you
definitely
an
enjoyable
sipping
beer
after
dinner
not
sure
id
pound
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
though
drinkability
was
ok
but
give
me
a
korbinian
anytime
notes
excellent
near
perfection
in
every
aspect
not
quite
as
big
abvwise
as
most
of
the
doppelbocks
ive
had
and
the
spicy
alcohol
character
is
not
as
pronounced
but
this
is
nitpicking
this
beer
is
malty
thorough
well
crafted
and
delightfully
complex
d
im
very
new
to
this
style
but
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
with
some
barbeque
ribs
and
baked
beans
i
think
wow
that
actually
sounds
very
very
good
right
now
i
may
prefer
this
style
to
porters
thanks
to
ayinger
for
another
excellent
lager
the
german
doppelbock
is
a
must
try
as
it
is
quite
different
than
american
dopplebocks
it
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
decent
head
on
it
while
there
is
very
little
carbonation
there
is
a
reasonably
strong
coffeecocoa
flavor
making
the
beer
extremely
flavorful
but
yet
giving
it
a
smooth
finish
drinks
fine
by
itself
but
would
pair
excellent
with
most
foods
d
the
fusel
alcohol
character
would
deter
me
from
more
than
one
of
these
but
if
i
had
a
pairing
situation
calling
for
a
dopplebock
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
call
in

a
beautiful
mahogony
color

held

dwindles
to
faint
traces
of
foam
smells
of
dark
chocolate
molasses
faint
anise
dark
malt
and
faint
trace
of
alcohol
taste
like
pouring
velvet
in
your
mouth
this
beer
tastes
and
feels
so
smooth
the
smokey
malt
dwindles
to
a
light
hoppy
finish
with
a
dry
feel
on
the
tongue
beautiful
this
is
an
abolutely
worldclass
beer
with
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
except
maybe
the
price

every
sip

very
easy

you

very
enjoyable
and
tasty
brew
conclusion
a
superbly
crafted
lager
the
low
abv
is
remarkable
considering
the
full
body
complex
flavors
and
overall
power
of
this
beer
this
goes
to
show
that
tons
of
alcohol
isnt
needed
to
make
a
big
beer
that
tastes
wonderful

of
the
best
beers

it
was

sweet
but
to
be
honest
hes

i
had
to
agree

ive
had
before

a
some
time
agomaybe
old
nickbut
not
for
sure
this
is
with
out
a
doubt
smooth
and
has
hints

to
taste
ayinger
does
so
well
creating
great
beer
this
is
terrific
must
buy
more
i
could
see
someone
drinking
a
whole
pack
to
figure
out
the
taste
but
i
only
bought
one
so
ill
just
content
myself
with
looking
at
the
nice
little
animals
on
the
front
of
the
bottle
drinks
prominently
i
enjoyed
this
beer
in
a
tasting
up
against
doppelbock
standouts
like
liberator
and
the
classic
salvator
and
even
amongst
the
greats
celebrator
still
stands
out
a
delicious
doppelbock
and
a
delicious
beer
in
general
d
very
smooth
roasted
smell
and
appearance
the
lacing
of
this
beer
is
amazing
great
retaining
head
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
the
taste
after
taste
is
an
enjoyable
bitterness
almost
a
sour
taste
very
enjoyable
could
really
drink
this
with
a
nice
meaty
meal
d
the
flavors
are
big
but
its
put
together
nicely
not
a
session
beer
but
id
love
to
have
more
than
one
poured
a
2
head
which
gradually
dissipated
to
14
dark
as
coffee
it
had
a
delicious
dark
roasted
malt
smell
and
taste
with
lots
of
chocolate
and
kind
of
a
rye
bread
bitterness
very
flavorful
stuff
including
a
long
finish
id
celebrate
with
this
anytime
drinkability
this
is
heavenly
nectar
im
typically
biased
towards
malty
brews
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
a
while
easy
to
sip
on
and
have
by
itself
i
dont
see
this
as
a
beer
that
you
could
drink
with
food
though
its
too
heavy
of
a
beer
its
flavor
might
overcome
whatever
you
were
having
drinkability
this
is
a
great
representative
of
the
style
the
price
brings
the
drinkability
down
a
bit
but
make
no
mistake
this
is
excellent
black
as
coal
one
finger
deep
yellow
white
head
and
opaque
i
cant
even
see
the
bubbles
hints
of
mollases
roasted
malts
and
grain
are
the
smelling
highlights
wow
that
taste
is
complex
where
do
i
start
toasted
malt
coffee
fruit
bread
and
banana
finished
off
with
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
coating
like
a
good
cough
syrup
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
these
just
at
my
own
pace
world
class
mouthfeeldrinkability
mouthfeel
is
just
under
medium
very
smooth
and
creamy
but
a
little
light
in
my
opinion
drinkability
is
high
this
beer
might
be
pretty
dark
but
it
is
smooth
and
the
alcohol
is
muted
by
all
the
great
flavors
very
drinkable
but
will
get
filling
after
a
few
even
though
i
like
a
bit
more
carbonation
in
my
beers
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
an
great
beer
quite
delicious
this
is
one
tasty
refreshing
doppelbock
that
warms
nicely
but
isnt
a
hard
hitter
sitting
at
6
7
abv
very
complex
dark
fruit
flavor
and
malt
went
perfectly
with
the
pot
pie
i
had
for
dinner
if
it
wasnt
for
the
high
price
i
might
make
this
my
goto
doppelbock
overall
what
a
wonderful
beer
i
have
tried
other
dopplebocks
and
this
is
almost
definitely
the
one
that
i
have
enjoyed
the
most
the
complexity
of
it
is
incredibly
exciting
to
the
palate
and
begs
me
to
come
back
for
more
very
drinkable
for
a
big
beer
because
the
whole
thing
is
really
very
balanced
this
is
definitely
not
a
beer
that
you
would
reach
for
on
your
average
trip
to
the
beer
store
but
it
is
a
wonderful
treat
for
a
special
occasion
and
definitely
a
great
warming
winter
beer
would
be
a
perfect
beer
to
sip
by
the
fire
on
christmas
eve
while
watching
the
snow
fall
ahhh
drinkability
youll
know
right
away
that
you
have
something
special
on
your
hands
with
this
beer
more
of
a
dark
dark
maroon
color
instead
of
a
brown
the
head
has
that
stout
like
chocolate
foam
color
it
doesnt
really
lace
the
glass
but
it
at
least
shows
up
and
hangs
out
for
a
while
a
rich
malty
nose
with
some
toffee
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
grainy
a
sweet
molasses
tickles
the
palate
and
the
slightest
hint
of
bitterness
that
is
almost
unnoticeable
the
finish
lingers
just
long
enough
to
leave
a
sweetness
on
your
lips
making
you
want
another
sip
great
food
beer
d
excellent
and
very
enjoyable
doppelbock
definitely
get
your
hands
on
it
if
you
see
it
medium
bodied
beer
with
lots
of
small
bubble
carbonation
leads
to
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
the
beer
is
a
little
too
easy
to
drink
as
i
can
easily
have
several
of
these
without
noticing
the
alcohol
content
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
i
completely
understand
why
it
gets
the
good
reviews
it
does
im
giving
it
an
a
and
i
would
buy
it
again
just
because
im
biased
to
the
troegenator
doesnt
mean
this
isnt
a
good
beer
d
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
nice
kick
nice
representation
of
style
i
could
sit
and
enjoy
a
few
of
these
on
a
fall
evening
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
the
epitome
of
dopplebocks
im
glad
that
i
was
able
to
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
and
im
going
to
be
sure
to
pick
up
many
more
in
the
future
very
high
at
6
7
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
only
bought
a
single
but
could
easily
have
another
great
taste
not
too
filling
wow
what
can
i
say
about
this
beer
it
pours
black
witha
tan
creamy
head
that
stayed
throughout
looks
very
much
like
a
stout
smells
very
very
malty
with
a
strong
choclate
flavor
the
taste
is
strong
and
heavy
very
heavy
in
the
malt
strong
choclate
flavor
the
heavy
flavors
kick
you
in
the
mouth
deffently
a
sipping
beer
overall
a
fantastic
beer
a
must
have
easy
easy
drinking
beer
it
would
be
unwise
for
me
to
have
more
than
one
but
the
temptation
is
definitely
there
pretty
mediocre
in
my
opinion
certainly
nothing
special
more
like
a
dunkel
than
a
doppelbock
especially
in
the
lack
of
sweetness
or
body
cant
believe
it
rates
this
highly
overrated
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
color
with
a
thick
white
foam
head
has
a
yeasty
aroma
of
dark
fruit
and
toffee
has
a
dry
bitter
taste
with
notes
of
dark
fruit
and
caramel
the
mix
doesnt
work
for
me
too
doughy
and
too
sweet
to
each
their
own
nice
medium
to
full
bodied
mouthfeel
slight
bit
of
prickly
carbonation
keep
it
alive
pour
a
nice
deep
brown
with
a
small
disappearing
head
the
aroma
has
hints
of
smoke
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
lovely
with
black
malt
b
caramel
nuts
smoke
notes
and
a
dry
coffee
taste
soft
and
creamy
palate
everything
about
this
beer
is
so
subtle
and
insanely
balanced
just
an
insanely
pleasant
beer
a
delightful
beer
that
i
will
attempt
to
not
finish
so
my
lady
can
try
it
upon
her
return
wish
me
luck
dnot
sure
why
this
is
so
highly
rated
may
very
well
be
a
fine
doppelbock
but
i
wasnt
as
impressed
as
i
expected
to
be
perhaps
it
has
more
to
do
with
a
preference
for
ales
over
lagers
nothing
surprising
here
the
effusive
longrunning
hype
is
more
than
well
deserved
call
it
what
you
will
the
blueprint
the
almost
progenitor
whatever
this
is
a
deftly
rendered
crazily
easy
to
drink
ampedup
dark
lager
for
all
your
latent
winterdespising
needs
notes
prost
to
franz
inselkammer
for
making
such
a
great
beer
id
still
say
belgians
have
the
edge
but
this
beer
does
make
me
proud
of
my
heritage
great
beer
will
have
to
go
for
the
four
pack
next
time
im
glad
i
got
the
4pack
db
extremely
drinkable
for
such
a
highly
flavorful
beer
the
body
allows
the
taste
to
truly
shine
has
an
old
alelike
flavor
set
but
drinks
like
an
apa
has
to
be
the
most
complex
and
flavorful
beer
for
the
price
superior
drinkability
celebrator
is
a
6
7
doppelbock
that
goes
down
like
water
the
first
tip
is
of
cocoa
developing
into
the
malts
and
ending
in
a
nice
touch
of
coffe
with
litte
hints
of
rippen
fruit
in
the
aftertaste
great
drinkabilty
and
very
refreshing
fairly
light
for
the
doppelbock
style
and
all
the
more
drinkable
for
it
to
me
this
is
what
a
doppelbock
should
be
malty
smooth
a
little
warming
and
very
drinkable
well
this
is
also
really
drinkable
i
dont
like
the
beer
i
rarely
dont
like
a
beer
i
often
think
its
a
weak
example
of
a
style
or
a
style
that
isnt
very
well
made
this
one
just
isnt
very
good
if
you
want
a
better
example
of
the
style
check
out
weihenstephaners
example
its
far
superior
so
im
torn
i
dislike
it
but
it
without
the
flavor
actor
is
pretty
drinkable
ok
well
go
with
a
2
unimpressed
but
not
awful
o
the
price
is
right
and
the
flavors
are
topnotch
maybe
as
good
as
ive
had
in
this
style
d
this
is
a
very
sweet
tasting
doppelbock
almost
too
sweet
for
me
it
is
a
nice
brew
but
a
one
and
done
for
me
this
is
very
nice
this
good
double
bock
seems
like
it
would
be
syrupy
and
heavy
but
it
is
not
it
is
smooth
and
rich
the
best
ive
had
of
this
style
but
not
by
much
like
salvador
or
optimator
with
a
more
complex
bitterness
that
they
lack
pours
a
dark
hazy
russet
brown
color
with
some
tan
head
smell
is
very
malty
with
some
syrup
chocolate
rye
bread
and
some
yeastiness
taste
follows
suit
with
some
big
sweet
malt
plays
and
an
interesting
sweet
potato
taste
which
may
be
due
to
a
bit
of
oxidation
still
a
very
good
malty
dopplebock
mf
is
medium
could
maybe
use
a
hint
more
carbonation
good
drinkability
definitely
one
i
will
revisit
notes
not
my
favorite
beer
i
do
feel
a
bit
awkward
rating
a
beer
so
differently
from
everyone
else
i
looked
at
the
brothers
review
and
i
see
that
i
noticed
similar
flavors
as
them
but
the
overbearingness
of
the
sweetness
really
takes
away
from
this
beer
i
will
save
the
rest
of
the
brews
and
retry
them
after
having
experienced
some
other
dopplebocks
when
you
feel
like
a
very
malty
lager
there
are
few
beers
you
should
turn
to
before
celebrator
absolutely
perfect
for
these
fall
evenings
an
exceptional
brew
indeed
so
enjoyable
and
so
tasty
a
must
try
aroma
is
of
dark
fruits
caramel
malts
light
chocolate
and
caramel
and
bready
malts
typical
german
yeast
notes
are
detectable
as
well
the
taste
is
heavenly
the
molasses
and
dark
fruits
in
the
nose
are
prevalent
in
the
taste
prunes
raisins
and
dark
cherries
dark
roasted
malts
not
bitter
by
any
means
make
an
appearance
with
a
strong
caramel
presence
the
more
it
warms
the
more
the
flavors
begin
to
develop
the
german
yeast
is
also
prevalent
in
the
finish
this
is
a
world
class
beer
true
definition
of
style
and
expert
brewing
tradition
there
is
a
certain
thickness
and
creamy
mouthfeelstill
finishes
slightly
dry
from
the
lager
yeast
cant
say
enough
about
this
beer
d
definitely
but
you
might
want
to
share
drinkabilty
well
i
just
bought
a
case
of
this
so
its
very
drinkable
its
more
of
a
winter
beer
they
say
but
seems
to
me
its
a
weekly
beer
fantastic
and
so
smooth
wow
drink
is
great
a
very
good
overall
dopplebock
of
course
with
any
import
i
have
a
feeling
this
isnt
the
freshest
it
could
be
do
delicious
could
and
would
put
down
a
few
of
these
if
it
came
to
it
went
down
way
too
fast
and
easy
out
of
the
handful
of
doppelbocks
ive
had
this
is
the
best
will
be
buying
more
a
well
balanced
easy
beer
to
drink
i
wish
i
didnt
have
to
pay
import
prices
for
this
beer
it
would
be
my
daily
tipple
if
i
could
afford
it
but
then
id
be
totally
spoilt
this
is
a
truly
great
beer
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
go
out
and
find
some
bottle
pours
clear
dark
brown
color
with
off
white
head
aroma
is
malty
sweetness
with
cinnamon
grape
and
plum
medium
mouthfeel
flavor
follows
the
nose
and
finishes
semi
dry
there
is
no
cloying
sweetness
and
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
great
brew
d
nicely
drinkable
not
too
heavy
and
a
great
sipping
beer
could
easily
get
lost
in
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
its
great
when
you
want
something
heavier
but
not
quite
as
heavy
as
a
stout
d
this
one
could
be
gone
in
no
time
but
im
savoring
it
because
its
my
first
ever
this
seems
like
a
beer
you
could
session
at
6
7
then
again
youd
probably
get
pretty
buzzed
ill
be
picking
up
a
few
more
of
these
for
sure
d
this
is
a
beer
that
goes
down
way
too
easily
world
class
drinks
well
probably
the
best
of
the
style
i
have
tried
to
date
its
sweet
without
becoming
cloying
its
complex
without
becoming
a
mess
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
and
provides
no
harshness
just
a
slightly
warm
feel
though
the
style
is
not
for
me
and
i
dont
see
myself
purchasing
this
too
much
as
viewed
within
the
style
parameters
this
beer
is
wonderful
pours
very
dark
the
color
is
a
wonderful
brown
almost
burgundy
with
and
inch
of
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
aroma
is
light
malt
coffee
and
some
molasses
taste
follows
scent
big
malt
followed
by
coffee
and
dried
fruit
a
little
hops
flavor
towards
the
back
of
the
tongue
slightly
bitter
finish
light
mouthfeel
with
light
carbonation
the
flavors
become
more
complex
once
the
palate
settles
down
and
the
beer
warms
a
little
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
easily
have
23
of
these
poured
pitch
black
no
light
getting
through
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
thin
lacing
the
nose
is
very
sweet
strong
malts
alcohol
is
definitely
present
this
left
my
mouth
confused
after
my
first
sip
the
malts
are
sweet
and
strong
my
mouth
is
left
searching
for
the
hops
but
none
are
to
be
found
the
after
taste
is
slightly
fruity
with
a
nice
alcohol
burn
i
do
love
me
hops
and
consider
myself
an
ale
man
but
this
doppelbock
is
defintely
a
nice
surprise
this
is
the
ultimate
dopplebock
very
very
drinkable
maybe
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
2
of
them
but
they
are
great
going
down
a
classic
and
one
of
those
beers
everyone
should
drink
every
now
and
then
much
better
than
i
anticipated
notes
very
good
beer
and
a
great
example
of
a
doppelbock
perfectly
balanced
with
the
dark
bread
dark
fruit
nutearth
brown
sugarmolasses
and
spice
with
a
good
kick
of
hops
bitterness
sweetness
and
tartness
quite
a
lovely
beer
that
i
would
definitely
recommend
d
it
took
me
a
while
to
drink
one
bottle
i
could
not
see
myself
having
more
than
one
in
a
night
drinks
impeccably
well
no
alcohol
heat
to
speak
of
at
all
extremely
palatable
flavors
with
no
off
flavors
at
all
damn
its
hard
to
put
a
finger
on
why
this
is
such
a
great
beer
but
it
really
is
a
great
great
classic
if
i
could
only
pick
one
beer
to
sum
up
why
german
beers
are
so
awesome
this
would
likely
be
it
overall
this
seems
like
a
milder
doppelbock
an
enjoyable
drink
indeed
but
going
by
the
style
guidelines
it
needs
to
be
more
aggressive
in
taste
and
body
one
of
my
favorites
this
is
an
excellent
dopplebock
and
very
enjoyable
drink
this
at
colder
temperatures
as
i
found
it
tasting
a
bit
better
world
class
brew
from
ayinger
one
of
the
best
doppels
moderate
carbonation
feels
crisp
on
the
tongue
with
the
initial
roastiness
medium
light
bodied
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
okay
tastes
good
and
seems
well
balanced
between
the
bitter
roastiness
and
sweetish
malt
dextremely
drinkable
has
got
to
be
the
best
dopplebock
ive
ever
had
d
very
delicious
but
only
when
cold
i
had
one
at
room
temperature
before
this
one
and
it
was
truly
nothing
special
a
lagerdoppelbock
should
really
be
drank
on
the
colder
side
the
taste
and
texture
really
come
out
if
its
chilled
properly
and
the
drinkability
really
is
inversely
proportional
to
the
temperature
overall
a
great
example
of
this
style
that
doesnt
overwhelm
but
is
just
solid
all
around
i
really
wish
this
was
easier
to
come
by
in
nh
nails
exactly
what
this
style
should
be
highly
recommended
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
which
appears
ruby
red
when
held
up
to
light
the
head
a
quite
big
and
tan
and
diminishes
rather
slowly
scent
is
very
sweet
molasses
and
dark
fruits
raisins
prunes
figs
i
also
get
some
cherries
a
bit
of
a
burnt
scent
as
well
absolutely
no
hops
the
taste
is
initially
slightly
metallic
and
then
overcome
by
dark
fruits
and
sugar
the
molasses
makes
itself
dominant
mid
taste
at
the
end
theres
a
very
nice
burnt
taste
along
with
dark
coffee
the
alcohol
is
more
noticeable
as
this
beer
warms
up
the
metallic
taste
also
goes
away
very
nice
taste
to
this
well
balanced
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
i
like
it
a
lot
the
drinkability
is
rather
high
d
really
good
doppelbock
its
drinking
easy
but
i
prefer
other
styles
glad
i
finally
tried
this
though
d
what
a
rich
and
flavorful
beer
im
no
expert
on
the
style
but
i
know
a
good
beer
when
i
taste
one
and
while
this
isnt
going
to
win
a
whole
lot
of
shelf
room
in
my
fridge
it
is
a
great
beer
none
the
less
drinkability
this
is
yet
another
beer
that
i
set
back
on
the
shelf
numerous
times
before
finally
purchasing
i
could
kick
myself
for
missing
out
on
such
a
great
beer
for
so
long
celebrator
is
more
than
deserving
of
all
its
accolades
wonderful
drank
while
listening
to
soundtrack
to
good
bad
and
the
ugly
its
certainly
a
malty
monster
but
i
like
that
it
doesnt
go
to
the
point
where
i
feel
im
going
to
go
into
a
diabetic
coma
from
drinking
it
its
balanced
quite
well
drinkability
its
good
but
it
is
a
dark
beer
just
wanting
you
to
savor
this
flavor
it
tastes
so
good
youll
want
to
savor
it
for
me
it
always
comes
down
to
drinkability
and
whether
or
not
i
would
buy
it
again
this
is
very
drinkable
and
in
my
opinion
a
good
introduction
to
darker
beers
and
i
wouldwill
definitely
buy
it
again
all
in
all
this
beer
is
good
but
i
just
simply
wasnt
wowd
to
get
an
a
out
of
me
i
need
to
be
wowd
i
found
this
merely
good
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
to
be
sure
all
around
good
beer
will
definitely
try
again
amazingly
drinkable
for
all
that
it
has
truly
a
great
beer
cant
wait
for
my
next
one
i
can
drink
a
whole
nother
bunch
of
these
now
n
always
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
blends
the
richness
of
100
german
kilned
malts
with
a
solid
hop
bitterness
and
smooth
finish
d
very
drinkable
there
are
so
many
tastes
in
this
6
7
beer
a
hint
of
coffee
some
chocolate
molasses
and
a
faint
fruitiness
couple
that
with
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
alcohol
and
you
have
yourself
a
world
class
beer
dark
and
quite
roasty
lost
in
molasses
and
apple
more
sweet
than
some
and
has
a
bright
fruit
quality
and
a
stored
preserve
quality
black
currant
blackberries
sour
in
there
masked
in
pollen
sweet
honey
and
molasses
earth
dates
and
an
old
leather
shoe
fantastic
i
would
say
best
after
about
a
year
of
sitting
around
at
cellar
temp
i
love
this
doppelbock
on
draught
however
i
prefer
this
wonderful
beer
form
a
bottle
this
is
the
first
bock
which
ive
had
in
awhile
and
i
really
liked
it
i
look
forward
to
drinking
it
again
in
the
coming
months
made
a
believer
out
of
me
ill
be
adding
some
doppelbocks
to
my
cellar
for
sure
poured
from
a
11

a

dark
brown
with
a
nice
creamy
tan
head
that
quickly
fades
i
get
smells
of
milk
chocolate
burnt

dark

a

a
nice

of

burnt

and
roasty
malty
sweetness
on
the
palate
very
tastey
mouthfeel
has
a
chewy
type
texture
that
keeps
begging
for
another
sip
a
very
good
brew
that
i
will
be
enjoying
alot
of
during
the
upcoming
cooler
months
d
a
little
bit
of
heaven
in
a

i
will
cry
when
i
drink
the
last
one
in
my
supply
a
big
thanks
to
kjkinsey
for
getting
me
this
one
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
fleeting
brown
head
it
is
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
the
smell
is
roasted
molasses
the
taste
is
roasted
malt
it
is
sweet
with
enough
roasted
flavor
to
mellow
it
out
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
i
prefer
a
little
more
viscosity
but
it
is
adequate
it
is
a
very
smooth
beer
and
i
like
the
roasty
character

this
one
stood
out
from
the
lot
by
its
especially
fruity
aroma
plums
and
cherries
abound
with
lots
of
caramelized
sugars
rather
cherry
taste
with
some
good
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
okay
creamy
with
very
fine
carbonation
d
it
drank
good
and
was
a
great
interpretation
of
a
dopplebock
i
could
definitely
drink
lots
of
this
brew
in
one
sitting
final
notes
this
beer
is
big
bold
and
complex
potentially
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
drank
its
nearly
perfect
enjoy
it
before
a
meal
when
your
palate
is
still
fresh
so
you
can
truly
appreciate
its
complexity
a
beautiful
beer
indeed
highly
recommended
this
is
a
style
of
brew
that
i
havent
had
much
experience
with
i
definitely
like
this
brew
a
lot
has
great
easy
drinkability
that
would
make
it
an
excellent
session
brew
however
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
like
in
a
world
class
kind
of
way
again
i
havent
had
many
of
the
style
so
maybe
i
need
to
research
get
drinkin
and
come
back
to
it
it
is
very
good
stuff
just
not
an
all
timer
which
i
was
expecting
its
taken
me
way
the
hell
too
long
to
review
this
especially
considering
how
long
ive
had
and
used
the
thoroughly
proper
glassware
it
pours
a
lovely
brown
complete
with
garnet
highlights
topped
by
a
finger
of
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
dark
wheat
rye
bread
pumpernickel
brown
sugar
and
nutmeg
the
taste
holds
notes
of
caramel
cinnamon
rye
bread
dark
wheat
light
molasses
and
a
touch
of
maple
syrup
the
maltiness
is
off
the
charts
in
a
very
good
way
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
sickeningly
smooth
feel
overall
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
ive
yet
had
and
a
true
ambassador
for
the
style
great
dopple
bock
really
interesting
stuff
going
on
with
the
light
spicieness
and
smokeyness
and
char
sadly
i
only
have
one
bottle
of
this
truly
a
brew
that
i
could
get
into
would
absolutely
love
to
session
this
if
ever
presented
with
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
its
a
must
d
wow
could
not
possibly
be
a
more
drinkable
beer
goes
down
way
to
easy
and
is
so
balanced
d
this
beer
is
close
to
perfect
celebrate
with
one
any
time
of
the
year
this
is
a
very
good
double
bock
with
a
high
enough
alky
content
to
leave
a
lasting
impression
on
your
dart
game
pours
a
opaque
dark
brown
color
with
good
tan
frothy
head
good
lacing
and
average
carbonation
caramel
nutty
smell
with
a
toasted
nutty
taste
very
smooth
medium
body
and
thin
slick
texture
very
light
bitter
creamy
finish
and
short
flavor
duration
very
easy
to
drink
probably
a
really
good
session
beer
if
it
wasnt
more
on
the
pricey
side
buy
again
yes
into
a
pilsner
glass
this
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
bright
amber
highlights
under
a
dense
pillowy
head
there
was
a
big
roasted
malt
and
nut
nose
with
a
significant
cocoa
accent
a
timid
mouthfeel
led
to
a
smooth
but
flavorful
chewy
center
and
concluded
with
a
surprisingly
light
but
quenching
malt
finish
all
in
all
this
is
one
of
the
most
full
flavored
smooth
and
well
balanced
distributions
i
have
experienced
on
my
palate
from
start
to
finish
this
made
a
perfect
match
with
pan
fried
pork
chops
and
was
especially
complimentary
of
the
burnt
fat
ends
of
the
chop
without
crying
perfection
i
can
only
guess
that
anything
better
than
this
would
have
to
do
with
going
to
germany
and
drinking
directly
from
the
brewery
source
itself

i
could
put
away
quite
a
few
of
these
a
solid
beer
that
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
more
over
time
this
is
one
easy
drinking
beer
great
flavor
and
color
typical
doppelbock
colors
the
head
is
really
nice
and
smooth
really
nice
feel
in
the
mouth
it
really
has
some
depth
with
some
oak
flavors
and
smoothness
once
again
like
most
of
my
reviews
great
with
german
cheese
and
crackers
or
bread
yes
there
are
other
cheeses
but
why
change
this
beer
is
my
constant
goto
beer
just
pour
it
in
and
enjoy
a
delicious
drinker
and
seemingly
lessfilling
than
many
doppelbocks
out
there
though
perhaps
owing
to
its
minimalist
serving
size
either
way
it
retains
all
of
the
characteristics
that
make
the
style
great
with
the
ubiquitous
plastic
bock
to
go
along
with
it
overall
i
thought
it
was
very
solid
but
not
spectacular
ill
drink
it
again
dark
complex
wellbalanced
and
evolving
celebrator
tastes
like
black
sabbath
sounds
dark
roast
black
forest
cake
malt
and
caramel
with
unfermented
fruity
sugars
a
hint
of
woody
hop
tang
at
the
end
nonexistant
carbonation
with
a
thick
mouthfeel
winey
alcoholic
warming
i
dream
of
this
beer
alcohol
is
fairly
low
in
comparison
to
some
other
doppelbocks
so
this
is
actually
really
easy
to
drink
usually
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
this
style
in
one
setting
but
i
think
this
may
be
the
exception
the
king
of
doppelbocks
and
always
worth
having
one
on
hand
pours
a
dark
black
color
12
inch
head
of
a
light
tan
color
decent
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
lager
yeast
and
some
earthy
malts
the
overall
aroma
characteristics
are
quite
muted
fits
the
style
of
a
doppelbock
smooth
and
crisp
mouth
feel
with
average
carbonation
levels
present
tastes
of
good
lager
yeast
smooth
yet
distinct
earthy
malts
and
the
hop
bitterness
is
noticeable
there
is
also
a
chocolaty
richness
that
is
quite
extraordinary
this
is
one
hell
of
a
smooth
lager
family
beer
includes
bocks
etc
definitely
worth
a
try
served
in
its
appropriate
glassware
at
the
belgian
cafe
this
beer
was
quite
a
treat
for
a
first
timer
dark
malty
and
plum
colored
body
with
a
voluminous
and
creamy
white
head
smells
earthy
grainy
and
exudes
some
hints
of
drupaceous
fruits
like
plum
and
prunes
mixed
with
some
fig
its
appearance
and
smell
combine
perfectly
to
deliver
the
drinker
with
pure
unadulterated
quality
doppelbock
taste
and
mouthfeel
though
are
what
make
this
beer
great
from
the
glass
it
ensconces
your
tongue
and
mouth
in
its
velvety
consistency
the
6
7
abv
stays
pretty
dormant
while
drinking
making
it
into
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
just
watch
out
because
sooner
or
later
the
abv
will
come
out
of
hiding
overall
an
excellent
beer
definitely
the
best
doppelbock
ive
ever
had
drinkability
i
would
have
this
again
for
sure
its
the
easiest
drinking
dopplebock
i
have
had
and
its
got
depth
in
flavors
that
make
it
drinkable
in
multiples
good
session
dopplebock
its
no
secret
this
is
one
of
the
best
and
a
beast
of
flavor
tastes
of
dark
sweet
bread
molasses
brown
sugar
a
bit
of
hops
and
alcohol
in
the
back
as
well
thick
cheweymaltey
goodness
i
love
this
beer
it
was
drinking
celebrator
that
originally
convinced
me
that
malt
forward
beers
were
as
good
as
hop
bombs
and
it
has
yet
to
let
me
down
if
i
had
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
with
only
one
beer
this
is
the
beer
for
me
that
being
said
i
will
continue
searching
for
a
better
beer
as
it
is
really
all
about
the
search
for
perfection
i
couldnt
wait
for
this
to
splash
on
my
tongue
and
was
not
disappointed
everything
that
was
there
in
the
smell
was
tastable
as
well
the
start
is
very
sweet
with
a
contrasting
nice
subtle
bitterness
very
nice
doppelbock
which
really
hit
the
spot
nice
beer
overall
another
great
doppelbock
i
will
absolutely
keep
a
couple
of
these
around
6
7
wont
kill
you
so
make
sure
you
pick
up
a
few
bottles
i
could
easily
make
this
a
session
beer
its
been
way
too
long
since
ive
had
one
of
these
easily
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
out
there
certainly
in
the
top
3
for
me
worth
every
penny
actually
a
little
low
on
the
abv
side
from
what
were
used
to
in
modern
takes
on
doppelbocks
might
actually
be
the
lowest
abv
doppelbock
ive
ever
drank
delicious
and
malty
though
its
between
this
and
salvator
for
me
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
exceptionally
smooth
and
rich
very
impressive
this
beer
is
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
but
does
not
put
to
hard
over
the
edge
it
is
very
flavorful
and
perfect
for
the
beer
drinker
thats
into
that
smoked
dark
taste
deasier
than
a
lot
of
dopples
to
drink
that
i
have
had
in
the
past
doesnt
sit
quite
so
heavy
mouth
is
a
bit
too
carbonated
for
a
dopplebock
mouth
is
thick
and
is
a
moderately
slow
drinker
good
definitely
know
why
its
so
high
on
the
list
edit
had
this
on
tap
stuff
yer
face
even
better
so
damn
good
i
had
to
show
up
twice
in
a
week
to
have
some
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
pretty
good
overall
not
sensational
like
i
expected
while
very
dark
brown
you
can
still
see
that
its
crystal
clear
without
a
trace
of
cloudiness
some
orange
comes
out
near
the
glass
bottom
has
a
very
pretty
and
fine
head
which
dissolves
pretty
fast
invitingly
sweet
nose
of
coffee
ice
cream
caramel
butterscotch
and
chocolate
covered
raisins
blends
in
banana
ginger
spice
pecans
all
malt
with
no
real
hoppiness
very
well
balance
nostril
presence
and
staying
power
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
definitely
smoothes
out
the
sweetness
and
allows
for
more
structural
balance
from
the
hops
brown
sugar
caramel
butterscotch
hard
coffee
candy
here
more
of
a
roasty
character
raisin
cherry
fruit
comes
through
traces
of
orange
peel
as
well
maintains
a
fresh
smoothness
throughout
taste
is
excellent
very
smooth
roasty
sweet
yet
complex
syrupy
sweetness
and
chocolately
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
almost
perfect
if
anything
the
carbonation
seemed
a
little
off
but
really
a
delicious
beer
i
would
say
this
compares
very
well
to
the
andechser
doppelbock
but
with
slightly
different
qualities
the
andechs
was
a
little
more
buttery
and
really
coated
the
palate
but
this
celebrator
has
great
roastiness
both
are
amazing
beers
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
end
carbonation
its
slightly
syrupy
with
a
smooth
and
rich
feel
despite
the
alcohol
presence
not
being
masked
this
is
very
drinkable
i
just
can
never
get
enough
of
this
stuff
over
all
really
enjoyed
this
beer
flavors
were
great
smelled
good
looked
nice
but
the
carbonation
was
my
only
problem
maybe
it
was
a
one
time
thing
would
buy
again
though
to
test
it
out
first
impression
not
quite
as
sweet
as
i
had
imagined
tangy
on
the
tongue
a
sweet
malt
up
front
but
quickly
zings
into
tartness
with
like
a
sour
plum
flavor
also
hoppier
than
i
figured
from
my
imagination
and
the
smell
regardless
the
bitterness
doesnt
linger
but
theres
a
little
bit
of
pleasant
cloying
actually
as
it
warms
it
further
reduces
the
bitterness
and
increases
the
sweetness
a
bit
in
the
end
the
bitterness
is
an
afterthought
compared
to
the
encompanying
malts
almost
roastiness
in
the
mouthfeel
the
longer
the
sip
the
fuller
the
malt
experience
mediumfull
bodied
and
creamy
and
very
drinkable
pleasantly
carbonated
a
little
let
down
on
the
flavor
possibly
because
my
expectations
were
so
high
but
the
other
aspects
of
my
sensory
perception
do
not
disagree
i
havent
had
a
doppelbock
before
but
if
this
one
is
the
cream
of
the
crop
i
look
forward
to
trying
some
others
at
10
for
the
four
pack
i
hate
to
try
it
again
for
fear
of
wasting
my
hardearned
beer
money
d
this
is
a
hell
of
a
good
beer
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
a
really
good
belgian
dubbel
rich
complex
and
aromatic
its
easily
the
best
doppelbock
i
have
ever
had
and
i
could
certainly
drink
a
few
in
one
sitting
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
and
not
too
thin
notes
this
one
was
recommended
by
a
friend
and
is
a
tasty
beverage
the
carbonation
seems
just
right
it
doesnt
intrude
on
any
other
aspect
of
the
beer
feels
nice
and
creamy
full
and
smooth
d
goes
down
smoothly
and
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
taking
it
slow
with
this
one
drinkability
the
best
dopple
i
have
had
by
far
excpectional
and
i
will
continue
to
drink
often

looking

maybe
some

with
notes
of

yummy
mixture
with
the

very
good

drinkability
dangerously
drinkable
i
had
to
consciously
take
it
slow
with
this
one
because
it
goes
down
way
to
easy
my
only
regret
is
not
having
more
available
poured
black
though
not
quite
opaque
from
the
330ml
bottle
about
one
finger
of
brown
head
resulted
and
quickly
dissipated
i
found
some
nuttinessmalt
in
the
aroma
which
actually
seemed
really
muted
though
perhaps
i
was
a
little
congested
first
sip
was
deliciously
roasty
and
i
tasted
coffee
notes
as
i
continued
through
the
glass
the
malt
and
nutty
flavors
stood
out
more
while
very
tasty
i
found
the
high
note
of
celebrator
to
be
its
perfect
creamy
mouthfeel
im
happy
to
have
tried
celebrator
at
last
and
id
gladly
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
dthis
has
great
drinkability
smooth
and
enjoyable
flavors
easy
to
drink
many
of
its
characteristics
are
appropriate
to
style
but
beyond
the
technicalities
it
tastes
great
this
is
a
classic
reliable
doppelbock
for
sure
but
i
am
spolied
by
todays
variety
of
offerings
i
know
this
is
a
classic
but
i
guess
i
must
just
not
be
into
doppelbocks
poured
good
nice
head
looks
good
smelled
a
bit
funky
tasted
like
a
piece
of
chalk
thats
been
sitting
in
a
puddle
for
a
couple
days
then
poured
in
a
bottle
w
a
little
goat
action
figure
tied
to
it
had
to
dump
it
my
pal
brewdog
hates
me
for
this
poured
a
dark
black
body
with
a
tan
head
smell
is
smokey
almost
like
bbq
and
a
small
hint
of
sweet
malts
taste
is
sweet
malts
with
lots
of
smokey
undertones
the
smokey
hints
are
more
of
the
meat
jerkylike
variety
than
smoked
or
roasted
coffee
this
is
not
a
smokey
stout
by
any
means
it
definately
has
lager
character
and
has
layers
of
sweet
smokey
notes
a
good
beer
a
good
dark
lager
and
unlike
most
beers
in
this
category
d
smooth
and
drinkable

wonderfully
balanced

of
my
favorites

how
many

the

pours
a
beautiful
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
small
head
i
found
the
beer
to
be
a
tad
too
sweet
but
otherwise
a
delicious
rich
nutty
flavor
high
drinkability
the
beer
was
smooth
and
velvety
but
not
thick
this
beer
us
easily
added
to
my
list
of
favorites
and
it
earns
a
welldeserved
spot
in
my
refrigerator
drinkability
very
high
most
beers
with
very
strong
flavor
profiles
i
could
not
have
several
of
in
a
day
this
is
strongly
flavored
but
i
could
drink
2
or
3
tonight
easily
and
want
more
this
weekend
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
although
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
sitting
not
my
favorite
style
but
for
what
it
is
its
pretty
good
pours
a
dark
rubybrown
with
a
quickly
dissipating
tannish
head
the
smell
is
definitely
one
of
a
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
amazing
with
a
nice
range
of
flavors
from
fruits
to
mild
coffee
undertones
perfect
balance
that
leaves
you
craving
more
i
love
this
beer
and
is
without
question
a
worldclass
doppelbock
d
you
could
go
through
a
whole
case
of
this
and
enjoy
every
moment
of
it
very
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
great
flavor
profile
d
im
just
stunned
by
how
good
this
is
ive
tended
to
ignore
german
beers
but
that
needs
to
change
pours
a
mahoganydeep
red
almost
black
very
thin
beige
head
smell
is
heavily
malty
and
sweet
fruits
it
has
a
strong
malt
flavor
with
sweet
molasses
fruity
the
mouthfeel
is
very
heavy
and
smooth
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
its
so
heavy
and
filling
it
would
be
difficult
to
drink
more
than
maybe
two
in
a
session
something
i
would
drink
and
be
satisfied
if
its
around
but
not
really
seek
it
out
d
enjoyed
this
as
a
dessert
beer
i
would
have
a
difficult
time
having
another
and
found
my
palate
almost
exhausted
after
the
huge
malt
assault
however
the
overall
experience
is
well
worth
it
particularly
late
in
an
evening
and
next
to
the
fireplace
overall
this
wasnt
something
that
appealed
to
me
very
much
i
had
much
higher
expectations
for
this
beer
decent
feel
with
light
carbonation
and
a
sweet
and
lingering
viscous
finish
drinkability
suffers
from
the
rich
malty
sweetness
yet
a
nice
winter
brew
in
moderation
but
then
i
live
in
san
diego
and
not
in
snow
country
so
i
dont
see
myself

dthis
is
a
very
nice
beer
would
i
want
another
absolutely
beyond
that
it
is
a
bit
too
filling
but
for
the
style
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
surprisingling
dark
but
clear
amber
pour
frothey
cream
head
good
balance
of
malt
toffeecaramel
raisin
wheat
bread
citrus
light
hops
good
clean
finish
typical
of
most
german
offerings
considering
this
is
one
of
the
highest
ranking
doppelbock
would
like
to
have
seen
more
of
all
the
usual
dopplebock
components
not
just
a
moderate
balance
of
them
that
said
it
is
still
very
good
probably
the
most
drinkable
ive
had
with
a
great
palate
for
someone
who
likes
big
beers
this
may
not
be
the
most
impressive
though
i
could
drink
this
brew
all
night
it
is
sooo
smooth
it
has
a
faintly
smoky
dryness
in
the
finish
a
nice
smooth
mediumbodied
beer
there
is
a
sheen
to
this
beer
it
has
a
unique
texture
to
fit
its
nose
and
flavour
palate
it
has
a
lingering
hold
on
the
tongue
and
on
the
mouth
impressive
all
in
all
an
extremely
good
beer
but
i
think
the
taste
is
lacking
a
bit
in
balance
and
complexity
in
my
opinion
not
all
its
cracked
up
to
be
though
nothing
to
scoff
at
quite
the
opposite
actually
appealing
dark
brownish
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
head
that
settles
to
18
and
sticks
with
the
beer
until
its
finished
well
done
raisins
dates
figs
chocolate
covered
cherries
and
a
slight
dampnessmustiness
on
the
nose
quite
complex
similar
tastes
nuts
mild
chocolate
and
good
maltiness
the
finish
along
with
the
creaminess
of
this
beer
is
fantastic
the
aftertaste
easily
lasts
for
a
few
minutes
very
drinkable
stuff
and
the
first
german
beer
to
wow
me
in
a
long
long
time
available
locally
for
under
10
a
4pack
this
will
make
a
regular
appearance
in
my
fridge
had
this
on
a
beer
tasting
event
on
a
cruise
ship
really
strong
doppelbock
smells
fabulous
looks
great
the
flavor
is
very
strong
toasted
dark
super
malty
creamy
enjoyable
palate
really
quality
doppelbock
not
really
my
style
and
super
filling
so
i
only
had
a
couple
before
i
switched
to
something
lighter
recommended
sadly
i
found
out
later
that
this
is
arguably
the
gold
standard
of
doppelbocks
so
all
others
after
this
will
pale
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
1
fingered
tan
head
with
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
is
very
nice
with
nice
hints
of
chocolate
and
nuts
the
taste
is
very
nice
with
some
chocolate
flavors
some
nut
flavors
and
a
very
nice
malt
base
the
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
and
creamy
with
a
decent
carbonation
level
if
anything
it
seems
a
little
low
a
highly
drinkable
brew
for
nearly
7
too
bad
it
costs
nearly
5
a
bottle
heavy
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
acidic
aftertaste
im
not
digging
the
aftertaste
so
much
which
also
affects
its
drinkability
i
sipped
on
this
one
for
a
long
time
and
i
didnt
feel
like
grabbing
another
but
if
i
liked
the
taste
more
this
would
be
a
good
easy
drinking
a
richly
complex
and
balanced
beer
that
i
would
love
to
always
have
on
hand
tastes
even
better
in
my
celebrator
glass
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
and
i
wish
i
had
an
endless
supply
i
drank
two
of
these
about
a
month
apart
before
reviewing
and
i
liked
it
even
better
the
second
time
perfect
on
a
cold
day
and
must
be
at
cellar
temperature
great
to
sip
on
and
relax
with
but
so
good
i
can
see
myself
drinking
it
too
quickly
i
also
really
like
the
classic
german
bottle
d
overall
a
great
beer
that
doesnt
disappoint
pours
black
with
amber
brown
edges
with
a
nice
frothy
head
that
settles
down
to
a
medium
thick
layer
on
top
really
complex
aroma
begins
with
raisins
but
deepens
into
a
rich
smoke
and
citrus
fruit
fing
dope
im
a
malt
person
so
my
first
sip
of
this
was
heaven
not
overly
strong
like
optimator
but
bready
with
a
good
alcohol
and
raisin
base
super
rich
mouthfeel
with
just
enough
carbonation
some
beers
have
different
characteristics
that
seem
very
separate
from
each
other
but
everything
about
this
beer
comes
together
into
one
the
alcohol
is
very
faint
here
too
but
just
enough
to
give
it
some
character
heres
to
my
100th
review
id
go
more
in
depth
but
im
enjoying
beers
with
friends
as
they
should
be
enjoyed
but
ill
be
grabbing
a
case
of
this
later
the
aroma
is
brown
sugar
alcohol
herbs
coffee
toasted
malt
and
hops
the
appearance
is
dark
redbrown
and
the
head
is
foamy
the
flavor
is
caramel
coffee
raisins
chocolate
spice
nuts
the
palate
is
just
the
right
thickness
for
the
style
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
acidic
for
my
liking
but
overall
its
very
good
even
with
all
the
hype
this
one
still
surprised
me
for
the
level
of
sweetness
it
is
effortless
to
drink
if
you
see
this
and
havent
had
it
you
must
buy
it
a
classic
and
worth
the
hype
bottoms
up
drinkability
is
decent
on
this
one
its
a
smooth
beer
but
not
something
im
going
to
drink
a
lot
of
overall
theres
not
much
more
i
can
say
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
that
is
very
well
done
notes
from
102904
d
almost
perfect
but
the
mouthfeel
could
be
improved
drinkability
another
beer
hyped
up
a
lot
before
i
tried
it
and
it
more
than
lives
up
to
its
reputation
i
paid
12
for
a
four
pack
of
this
which
for
a
college
student
is
rather
steep
in
this
case
it
was
worth
it
not
something
i
will
buy
regularly
because
of
the
priceavailability
but
something
i
would
love
to
get
again
quite
drinkable
indeed
cant
believe
ive
never
had
one
of
these
before
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
foamy
tan
head
that
forms
a
lacing
that
lasts
throught
the
whole
glass
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
chocolate
toffee
and
roasted
coffee
very
quaffable
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
malty
chocolate
flavor
caramel
toffee
and
roasted
malt
notes
this
is
one
hell
of
a
dopplebock
the
best
that
i
have
had
to
date
for
sure
it
smells
great
invigorates
the
tongue
with
a
deliciously
malted
toastiness
that
combines
with
the
flavors
of
two
of
my
favorite
fruits
and
is
incredibly
smooth
add
the
great
bangforyourbuck
value
and
youve
got
a
surefire
winner
this
is
one
that
every
avid
beer
drinker
should
try
definitely
a
musthave
now
if
youll
excuse
me
i
shall
have
another
at
once
it
pours
dark
and
thick
with
a
very
creamy
thick
head
that
is
3
fingers
and
lasts
a
long
time
in
a
nice
cold
frosty
mug
the
taste
is
very
complex
and
delicious
it
should
be
sipped
slowly
to
enjoy
every
mouth
full
it
is
my
favorite
beer
except
for
ommegang
abbey
ale
which
tastes
very
much
like
it
from
now
on
every
time
i
go
to
totalwine
totalwine
com
my
local
watering
hole
i
will
buy
a
few
bottles
of
this
beer
without
fail
if
i
thought
i
could
brew
my
own
beer
and
it
could
taste
as
good
as
this
beer
and
cost
less
not
that
it
costs
that
much
because
it
doesnt
i
would
go
through
the
trouble
if
you
can
find
this
beer
do
yourself
a
big
favor
and
try
some
soon
trust
me
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
dark
mahogany
with
an
agressive
cream
colored
head
the
aroma
is
all
malt
with
hints
of
fruits
spice
and
toast
the
flavor
is
rich
malty
sweetness
dominates
with
toffee
and
fresh
baked
bread
the
finish
is
very
clean
with
a
slight
hop
character
celebrator
has
a
great
silky
mouthfeel
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
doppelbock
style
and
is
definitely
a
benchmark
overall
a
spectacular
doppelbock
there
are
some
better
ones
out
there
but
you
cannot
go
wrong
with
this
d
hides
the
abv
well
a
decent
session
beer
overall
really
quite
tasty
being
that
it
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
but
would
definitely
look
forward
to
having
again
a
very
drinkable
sipper
drinkability
relatively
low
abv
for
a
doppelbock
it
tastes
great
and
goes
down
well
recommended
this
strong
lager
just
might
be
the
ultimate
beer
and
i
tend
not
to
be
a
lagerhead
at
6
7
the
abv
is
at
the
low
end
of
the
range
for
doppelbocks
so
the
alcohol
presence
is
not
overwhelming
as
it
can
be
with
some
versions
of
this
style
the
taste
and
appearance
become
one
as
the
smokey
carmel
sweetness
is
bespoken
by
the
creamy
tan
head
and
dark
reddishbrown
body
enjoy
this
one
in
a
proper
vessel
brandy
snifter
to
enhance
its
regal
qualities
pours
a
dark
brown
red
color
body
with
some
head
a
tannish
color
belgian
aroma
dark
fruit
sugary
malty
dark
roasted
flavor
wood
little
dark
fruit
roasted
aftertaste
some
alcohol
porterish
okay
for
a
porterlike
taste
da
big
suprise
for
me
one
of
the
few
german
beers
that
actually
taste
good
here
in
the
us
a
very
drinkable
doppelbock
i
only
had
the
one
but
it
left
me
wanting
more
medium
body
well
carbonated
crisp
but
complex
the
building
taste
ends
up
leaving
a
lot
on
your
palate
none
of
it
bad
malt
bombs
like
this
are
very
rarely
so
drinkable
i
had
to
quote
him
i
started
slowly
sipping
this
one
to
savor
it
but
i
kept
wanting
more
with
each
sip
and
before
i
knew
it
my
beer
was
gone
after
finished
it
i
wanted
another
one
immediately
i
am
very
happy
to
see
this
on
the
shelfs
at
bevmo
as
i
will
be
needing
to
drink
this
again
stat
tasty
expression
of
the
malt
i
feel
like
im
missing
something
here
but
i
expected
more
excellent
drinkability
for
a
dopplebock
it
is
so
good
in
the
colder
months
a
real
treat
to
try
on
tap
great
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
beer
lives
up
to
the
hype
great
aroma
roasty
bitter
and
sweet
not
as
dominant
as
the
flavor
but
it
holds
its
own
deep
ruby
pour
with
a
dark
brown
center
medium
tan
head
and
solid
lacing
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
unbelievably
smooth
with
a
rich
full
finish
flavor
is
strong
and
hearty
roasted
burnt
maltiness
with
some
light
coffee
and
dark
bitter
chocolate
and
fruits
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
wish
this
werent
so
expensive
or
id
keep
a
few
around
more
often
drinkability
complexity
is
good
but
not
all
that
smooth
the
taste
and
smell
are
very
rich
and
im
not
digging
the
bigtime
maltiness
thinking
about
lowering
this
score
a
little
actually
overall
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
is
great
to
enjoy
on
a
cold
autumn
evening
i
suppose
that
i
could
appreciate
how
someone
would
like
this
but
its
not
one
that
i
would
go
for
its
a
shame
because
i
went
in
expecting
much
more
i
rather
go
for
a
substantial
brown
ale
or
porter
in
the
same
abv
range
the
mouth
on
this
one
is
quite
unique
it
poured
almost
like
a
thick
stout
but
doesnt
go
down
as
such
decent
carbonation
mediumfull
bodied
and
a
smooth
clean
finish
very
drinkable
i
love
doppelbocks
and
this
one
is
a
fine
example
soft
rich
and
delicious
its
good
it
has
all
of
the
great
malty
beer
characteristics
without
the
bloated
belly
after
affects
poured
a
dark
amber
color
especially
in
the
light
with
a
14
tan
foam
head
that
disspitated
quickly
the
smell
was
of
sweet
malts
raisins
and
a
hint
of
coffee
notes
as
it
warmed
the
taste
was
well
balanced
with
the
presence
of
dark
fruits
mollasses
and
a
red
grape
aftertaste
complimenting
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
really
smooth
with
little
carbonation
definitly
recommended
on
a
nice
fall
night
overall
a
smooth
rich
deceptively
strong
beer
i
recently
had
this
at
a
restaurant
paired
with
duck
and
it
was
simply
amazing
overall
i
couldnt
imagine
having
a
better
experience
in
tasting
a
doppelbock
for
the
first
time
enjoy
d
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
dopplebock
i
cant
imagine
one
that
could
taste
any
better
a
little
heavy
to
be
a
session
beer
for
me
but
very
drinkable
nonetheless
suggestions
serve
at
a
temperature
of
5
deg
c
in
a
tulip
shaped
glass
accompanies
well
most
plates
redwhite
meat
vegetables
fruit
chocolate
but
the
best
way
to
enjoy
is
with
just
some
pretzels
the
aftertaste
is
good
but
my
mouth
feels
a
bit
puckered
from
the
sweet
malt
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
doesnt
overwhelm
quite
a
tasty
beer
d
great
beer
this
is
a
special
beer
because
this
is
the
beer
that
advances
my
karma
from
initiate
to
disciple
i
chose
this
carefully
because
i
love
this
beer
and
i
thought
celebrator
would
be
a
great
beer
to
celebrate
the
next
step
served
in
a
chalice
a
not
quite
opaque
black
w
ruby
highlights
the
beer
is
topped
with
a
thin
head
that
diminished
to
a
thin
layer
and
left
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
nice
blend
of
brown
malts
chocolate
and
roasted
nuts
the
taste
was
a
wonderful
array
of
malts
with
lingering
espresso
bitterness
the
beer
was
medium
bodied
with
warming
alcohol
and
decent
carbonation
this
beer
has
always
been
very
enjoyable
and
its
even
better
on
draft
d
drinkability
is
very
good
pours
a
very
dark
brown
in
color
damn
near
black
nice
inch
of
mocha
colored
head
forms
on
the
pour
smell
is
dark
roasted
malts
and
im
getting
a
bit
of
cocoacoffee
taste
is
lots
of
toffee
some
more
roasted
malts
this
is
incredibly
full
and
creamy
on
the
mouthfeel
what
a
beer
i
dont
recall
having
anything
like
this
in
a
long
while
d
havent
had
many
of
this
style
but
i
like
it
a
lot
definitely
will
go
back
to
this
one
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
full
two
fingers
of
creamy
relatively
longlasting
offwhite
head
aroma
is
strongly
malty
with
some
dark
fruits
notes
from
the
munich
malts
taste
is
rich
and
quite
malty
some
more
dark
fruits
figs
prunes
etc
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
a
moderate
hop
bitterness
the
malt
flavor
is
present
throughout
whereas
the
other
flavors
seem
to
come
and
go
initially
the
flavor
is
overwhelming
fruity
figs
prunes
then
the
hop
bitterness
appears
but
soon
yields
to
a
wonderful
cocoa
flavor
the
chocolate
flavor
lingers
into
the
finish
where
is
mingles
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
finish
is
decidedly
sweet
but
this
beer
is
by
no
means
under
attenuated
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
body
and
moderate
to
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
excellent
just
shy
of
perfect
incredibly
complex
flavors
coupled
with
a
a
well
masked
alcohol
presence
make
this
beer
a
treat
i
have
had
this
beer
many
many
times
but
i
thought
i
would
sit
down
and
actually
evaluate
it
for
once
i
opened
the
bottle
and
poured
it
into
a
heavy
pint
glass
it
pours
well
with
a
very
festive
foam
and
thick
creamy
head
that
lasts
the
color
is
a
dark
black
with
maybe
a
hint
of
amber
it
smells
toasty
with
a
strong
malt
essence
after
the
sip
i
notice
an
extremely
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
slight
sweetness
but
then
i
get
a
smack
bam
with
a
strong
yet
pleasant
bold
coffeeish
flavor
the
sweetness
diminishes
and
i
taste
a
strong
malty
goodness
i
love
this
beer
and
always
have
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
trying
out
new
doppelbocks
or
is
into
dark
beers
in
general
its
a
dark
beer
with
real
flavor
fullbodied
smooth
and
very
very
drinkable
i
remember
why
i
dont
drink
this
more
the
sugars
lead
to
a
jagerbomb
effect
and
after
one
bottle
i
had
to
pause
for
a
few
minutes
this
is
one
great
beer
that
packs
a
punch
as
well
next
time
ill
buy
more
wow
like
dark
heaven
in
a
glass
can
i
have
some
more
please
i
was
very
impressed
that
i
found
it
on
tap
it
was
at
tizleys
euro
pub
in
downtown
poulsbo
wa
this
is
definitely
the
standard
for
the
doppelbock
style
i
have
not
come
across
any
that
have
even
come
close
to
this
in
my
opinion
based
on
the
doppelbocks
ive
tried
this
sets
the
standard
for
the
style
highly
recommended
overall
good
beer
worth
a
trial
d
this
is
deceivingly
potent
beer
which
makes
it
harder
to
want
to
drink
several
of
i
can
see
why
this
ranks
on
the
top
100
beers
in
the
world
id
love
to
have
several
of
these
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
strong
rich
and
a
must
for
any
doppelbock
fans
this
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
deep
opaque
sable
almost
like
a
stout
or
porter
rather
than
a
bock
rich
malty
aroma
has
undertones
of
chocolate
and
roast
coffee
flavor
is
smooth
and
malty
with
some
hop
bitterness
and
a
mocha
undertone
there
are
hints
of
sweet
nutty
and
caramel
flavors
as
well
texture
is
smooth
and
pleasing
making
for
one
lipsmacking
bock
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
cherry
tint
to
it
and
a
relatively
thin
head
the
aroma
is
malty
with
chocolate
but
not
overpowering
this
definitely
is
a
good
tasting
beer
at
first
it
is
slightly
sweet
with
some
roasted
dark
chocolate
flavor
with
a
malty
flavor
kicking
in
there
is
a
slight
coffee
presence
in
the
background
sweet
slightly
bitter
dry
finish
its
quite
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
poured
an
amazing
dark
brown
color
rich
nose
is
toffee
caramel
chocolate
brown
sugar
with
a
roastiness
taste
is
exactly
what
i
want
in
a
dopplebock
nice
mouthfeel
not
too
sticky
creamy
but
not
too
heavy
drinkability
is
up
there
very
drinkable
and
perfect
for
a
cool
late
summer
night
i
just
wish
they
had
it
in
bigger
bottles
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
drinkability
any
brew
that
comes
with
a
ram
ornament
that
comes
from
germany
automatically
gains
cool
points
in
my
book
and
this
one
lives
up
to
the
hype
would
take
time
out
the
day
and
have
a
session
with
this
beauty
anytime
and
anyplace
highly
recommended
it
your
into
doppelboks
d
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
despite
its
relatively
high
abv
i
will
without
a
doubt
be
having
this
brew
again
d
now
that
is
a
doppelbock
a
style
defining
brew
the
best
of
the
german
doppelbocks
in
my
opinion
dark
dark
brown
nearly
black
brew
that
pours
beautifully
nice
head
that
thins
to
a
clingy
tan
ring
caramel
figs
and
dare
i
say
it
canned
pineapple
in
the
aroma
malty
sweetness
and
what
a
flavor
aged
malts
and
wholewheat
bread
subtle
molasses
and
or
brown
sugar
counterpointed
by
a
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
end
balanced
and
very
very
deep
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
great
mouthfeel
smooth
but
poignant
carbonation
good
finish
too
a
demanding
beer
that
is
not
for
novices
d
yep
great
packaging
for
a
great
beer
wish
i
had
more
d
uber
high
i
could
drink
these
all
daynight
and
with
anything
pretty
much
food
wise
d
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
best
example
i
have
had
of
this
style
its
not
too
complex
but
very
smooth
and
drinkable
nothing
is
cloying
or
overpowering
on
the
other
hand
nothing
is
thin
or
underrepresented
just
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
havent
had
many
dopplebocks
in
my
life
but
this
one
lived
up
to
my
expectations
very
tasty
and
i
would
say
an
ideal
beer
for
an
after
dinner
snack
the
celebrator
okay
then
i
shall
begin
celebrating
the
beer
poured
out
with
a
deep
brown
hue
we
are
talking
midnight
brown
light
has
trouble
getting
through
and
when
it
does
it
picks
up
that
brown
visual
with
a
touch
of
red
the
head
evaporated
pretty
quickly
the
scent
is
a
subtle
nutty
woodsy
aroma
with
some
mocha
caramel
is
the
first
flavor
which
quickly
settles
into
a
convocation
of
coffee
mocha
molasses
almond
flavors
really
deep
complex
flavor
where
all
the
pieces
come
together
onebyone
creating
a
new
experience
there
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
burn
in
the
back
of
your
throat
if
you
dont
watch
it
but
the
beer
is
smooth
enough
absolutely
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
attractive
in
more
than
one
sense
eric
drinkability
surprisingly
refreshing
tasty
and
quite
complex
for
a
doppelbock
one
of
the
classics
and
definitely
recommended
plus
the
charms
neat
very
drinkable
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
great
deal
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
this
style
d
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
cheers
finished
of
my
4pk
the
other
day
pours
a
deep
amber
with
nice
clarity
very
rich
in
flavor
with
toffee
caramel
and
a
hint
of
coffee
finishes
dry
with
a
subtle
chocolatecoffee
aftertaste
has
a
creamy
body
with
just
enough
alcohol
to
satisfy
the
palate
a
very
very
good
doppelbock
worth
purchasing
every
month
d
goes
down
very
easy
and
seems
drinkable
even
with
the
high
abv
drinkability
one
of
the
finest
beers
to
ever
grace
our
planet
a
simply
aweinspiring
creation
that
every
beer
lover
must
try
at
least
once
in
their
lives
i
must
make
the
pilgrimage
to
ayinger
to
try
this
fresh
tastes
of
roasted
nuts
sour
up
front
cocoa
prune
and
raisin
bitter
on
the
backend
faint
smoky
dry
finish
d
solid
but
not
spectacular
i
expected
more
i
may
have
had
my
hopes
set
too
high
on
this
one
and
was
let
down
i
expected
one
of
the
best
beers
i
ever
tried
but
only
got
a
slightly
above
average
brew
notes
im
admittedly
not
the
hugest
fan
of
dopplebocks
so
this
one
was
sitting
in
my
closet
for
a
while
im
pretty
glad
i
picked
this
up
and
would
definitely
do
so
again
in
the
future
even
mouthfeel
on
the
thin
side
finishes
dry
and
crisp
very
drinkable
incredibly
tasty
and
smooth
and
complex
beer
www
theviceblog
com
feels
full
rich
lingers
well
on
the
palate
first
time
ive
had
this
beer
very
nice
drinkabililty
is
high
but
perhaps
a
bit
heavy
for
the
summer
months
definitely
a
beer
i
prefer
on
a
rainy
night
i
will
celebrate
the
fact
that
this
is
my
last
beer
of
the
night
but
it
was
enjoyable
none
the
less
ill
reach
for
this
one
again
and
again
drinkablity
i
savored
the
last
sip
of
this
like
a
coke
fiend
on
the
short
end
of
a
bag
highly
recommend
yum
d
flavor
isnt
overbearing
and
the
alcohol
is
not
detectable
really
drinkable
for
this
style
nothing
revolutionary
but
its
impressively
complex
a
classic
doppelbock
that
sets
the
bar
d
drinkability
is
very
good
this
beer
is
sweet
complex
and
practically
defines
the
style
of
doppelbock
the
alcohol
is
a
tad
high
but
does
not
keep
this
one
from
going
down
quick
and
easy
i
could
easily
have
more
of
these
hats
off
to
aying
for
this
offering
dopplebocks
tend
to
be
a
personal
favorite
and
this
one
did
not
let
me
down
it
pours
very
dark
and
mouth
watering
the
smell
isnt
too
noticable
but
the
taste
is
very
rich
roasted
and
choclately
the
sweet
choclately
taste
does
not
become
overpowering
however
and
it
is
very
drinkable
doesnt
begin
to
weigh
you
down
or
feel
too
filling
the
most
outstanding
characteristic
is
the
mouthfeel
it
is
very
bubbley
but
with
tiny
microbubbles
which
make
each
sip
delightful
and
fun
highly
suggested
for
fans
of
dopplebocks
and
baltic
porters
or
other
similar
styles
wow
this
is
damn
near
a
baltic
porter
its
so
dark
everyone
seems
to
have
their
own
definition
of
doppelbock
and
ayinger
thinks
it
should
be
rich
roasty
chocolatey
slightly
bitter
and
really
smooth
this
one
definitely
deserves
its
world
class
reputation
d
ayinger
celebrator
doppelbock
is
a
work
of
art
the
only
thing
limiting
drinkability
is
the
abv
and
slight
heaviness
in
the
stomach
still
this
is
a
beer
to
be
savored
and
enjoyednot
sessioned
highly
enjoyable
this
is
just
an
overall
fantastic
beer
ive
had
it
several
times
and
it
always
manages
to
impress
me
definitely
should
be
tried
this
is
one
beer
that
i
will
continually
drink
i
do
not
generally
consider
myself
the
biggest
doppelbock
person
but
this
is
a
definite
winner
slick
with
only
the
barest
of
carbonation
the
drink
is
smooth
and
very
drinkable
it
poured
black
color
with
a
tan
head
that
faded
rather
quickly
aromas
were
sweet
with
scents
of
sweet
malt
brown
sugar
raisin
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
the
palate
is
mediumbodied
but
concentrated
and
shows
some
dry
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweetness
from
the
nose
bottle
pours
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
not
much
retension
aroma
is
rich
with
malty
aromas
dark
fruit
and
dry
roast
coffee
initial
taste
is
nutty
with
a
hoppy
zing
mouth
feel
is
smooth
creamy
and
not
too
sweet
toasted
aroma
lingers
long
after
the
head
dimishes
enhancing
the
flavor
best
doppelbock
ive
had
yet
d
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
i
shouldnt
very
heavy
brew
that
makes
for
a
great
after
dinner
beverage
this
is
one
of
the
best
brews
i
have
had
damn
near
perfect
medium
body
and
smooth
delicious
flavor
make
this
an
easy
drinker
very
enjoyable
and
an
excellent
doppelbock
overall
impressions
different
and
very
enjoyable
ill
definitely
be
exploring
this
style
further
overall
this
beer
is
a
real
winner
bocks
are
a
favorite
of
mine
and
when
theyre
as
big
and
flavorful
as
celebrator
well
its
cause
for
celebration
so
well
balancedso
perfect
in
every
way
i
never
thought
i
would
have
a
doppelbock
that
was
so
refreshingso
light
bodied
and
yet
so
satisfying
truly
remarkable
in
every
sense
of
the
word
and
sessionable
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
a
bit
strongerbut
what
right
do
i
have
to
complain
d
6
7
this
is
one
great
beer
of
all
doppelbocks
ive
had
this
one
is
king
d
the
definition
of
a
dopplebock
my
favorite
style
of
all
time
and
i
would
arugue
is
possibly
the
best
dopplebock
in
the
world
this
is
nicely
done
a
good
example
of
the
style
md
full
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
an
excellent
beer
in
the
court
of
the
prince
of
beers
man
this
is
a
bulwark
of
dopplebocks
one
of
the
very
best
this
one
is
an
interpretation
that
is
earthier
and
a
bit
more
scrappy
perhaps
even
a
little
more
drinkable
than
the
original
dopplebock
poured
wth
a
nice
tan
head
fine
and
a
bit
creamy
dark
almost
opaque
brown
a
little
crisper
in
the
mouth
with
excellent
carbonation
a
nice
smokey
character
just
enough
bittersweetness
to
make
you
want
to
have
another
swallow
beer
at
its
best
a
good
ayinger
beer
to
say
the
least
ive
never
had
a
bad
one
mouthfeel
was
good
by
the
looks
of
it
i
was
not
expecting
the
carbonation
that
was
hiding
in
there
ayinger
celebrator
pours
from
it
awesome
bottle
a
very
dark
brown
coffee
like
color
a
small
tan
head
hangs
around
on
top
the
smell
is
chocolate
and
figs
the
taste
has
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
a
hint
of
alcohol
also
shows
up
and
a
slight
bitterness
shows
up
a
few
seconds
after
the
swallow
i
also
get
a
tastescent
sensation
of
split
firewood
postswallow
but
im
not
exactly
sure
where
its
coming
from
the
taste
is
defintely
a
lager
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
with
midtolow
carbonation
this
is
just
a
very
wellmade
brew
a
11
2
ounce
bottle
ayinger
celebrator
the
bottle
has
dueling
rams
on
the
label
and
nice
goat
trinket
hanging
from
the
neck
i
love
the
bottle
pouring
into
the
glass
revealed
a
very
dark
brown
essentially
black
brew
with
a
centimeter
or
two
of
light
tancolored
head
the
aroma
has
a
strong
dark
malt
character
with
toffee
and
chocolate
smooth
and
ample
bodied
on
the
palate
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
commingle
with
a
roasted
malt
bitter
bite
and
also
a
slight
sweetness
very
drinkable
and
pleasing
not
over
the
top
just
a
great
quality
balanced
brew
a
great
reminder
that
beer
need
not
be
extreme
to
excellent
drinkability
great
beer
very
easy
to
drink
smooth
and
tasty
i
just
wish
that
the
smell
had
a
little
more
bang
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
an
evening
but
would
eventually
want
to
drink
something
else
to
make
things
interesting
overall
very
good
i
would
pick
this
one
up
again
d
very
easily
drinkable
especially
on
nice
cold
rainy
nights
overall
this
is
an
exceptionally
drinkable
beer
i
have
enjoyed
many
of
these
over
the
years
and
shall
continue
to
do
so
pours
dark
caramel
brown
light
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
of
caramel
chocolate
and
toffee
very
rich
mouth
feel
this
is
almost
a
meal
slightly
smoky
taste
medlow
carbonation
nice
better
finish
wellbalanced
the
standard
for
dopplebocks
overall
this
is
much
better
than
i
remembered
a
very
solid
wellmade
brew
i
found
this
to
be
better
cold
d
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
due
to
the
high
malt
content
it
starts
to
fill
you
up
towards
the
end
of
the
beer
due
to
this
the
lighter
mouthfeel
makes
the
beer
easier
and
more
fun
to
enjoy
definitely
will
have
again
and
recommended
d
this
is
a
delicious
beer
definitely
my
doppelbock
of
choice
from
now
on
however
how
many
of
these
suckers
could
i
drink
in
a
night
not
many
the
liquid
bread
that
it
purports
to
be
fills
one
up
quickly
nonetheless
this
is
the
goto
doppelbock
so
that
makes
up
for
it
d
the
fullbody
of
the
beer
is
limits
the
drink
slightly
but
its
so
damn
tasty
that
who
cares
definitely
gonna
have
to
get
me
some
more
of
this
this
is
the
dopplebock
to
drink
easy
to
find
at
least
in
my
experience
and
a
complete
joy
to
drink
do
not
pass
it
up
if
you
see
doing
so
and
youll
miss
out
on
one
of
the
finest
beers
in
existence
very
drinkable
higher
abv
but
drinks
easy
alcohol
is
a
bit
warming
but
does
not
hurt
the
drinkability
overall
a
thick
and
complex
doppel
that
is
very
palatable
delicious
an
amazing
example
of
the
depth
of
the
bock
style
overall
i
like
it
one
of
the
best
dopplebocks
around
and
worthy
of
its
rating
d
this
is
phenomenal
my
favorite
dopplebock
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
for
packing
so
much
flavor
everything
is
so
well
balanced
and
blended
together
an
eventful
beer
for
sure
try
it
to
say
you
hit
that
picked
this
up
during
the
nepa
beer
club
april
split
this
was
the
first
beer
from
my
batch
that
i
tried
ayinger
pours
a
wonderful
shade
of
ruby
red
with
thin
tan
head
aroma
of
roasted
nutiness
and
dark
fruits
greet
the
nose
taste
is
little
chewy
up
front
but
the
finish
is
quite
smooth
some
malts
and
raisin
are
noticeable
in
the
flavor
not
a
filling
beer
and
actually
quite
good
seek
and
enjoy
oh
and
add
an
extra
5
0
for
collecting
goats
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
and
wish
i
could
find
it
on
draft
somewhere
anywhere
celebrator
is
a
very
deep
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
it
smells
sweet
and
malty
and
a
little
nutty
i
think
taste
is
very
good
again
very
malty
without
being
too
thick
mouthfeel
is
good
not
much
carbonation
with
a
long
lingering
aftertaste
i
usually
like
double
bock
in
the
fall
and
winter
but
this
is
a
good
choice
all
year
pours
a
beautiful
deep
brown
almost
black
with
a
robust
tan
head
that
fades
to
some
lacing
the
smell
was
sweet
almost
fig
with
coffee
hints
the
taste
was
very
good
cream
coffee
grain
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
smooth
slightly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
was
very
good
this
is
a
beer
i
like
to
savor
for
a
while
but
its
highly
drinkable
a
king
among
doppelbocks
i
would
take
abath
in
this
if
i
could
afford
it
d
i
dont
think
id
want
more
than
one
of
these
though
i
could
see
some
folks
having
a
few
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
rather
heavy
and
the
alcohol
really
starts
showing
as
the
beer
warms
bocks
in
general
arent
the
most
sessionable
of
beers
anyway
well
i
dont
know
what
to
say
more
i
can
definitely
taste
the
ayinger
in
this
one
mmmmm
good
a
really
nice
brown
sugar
spiced
up
with
a
nice
flowery
but
every
so
slightly
there
hop
mmmm
mmm
you
can
tell
how
much
im
enjoying
a
drink
by
how
many
times
i
type
mmm
this
bottle
is
too
darn
small
mmm
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
with
good
flavors
it
is
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
the
feeling
in
your
mouth
and
while
you
drink
it
is
smooth
but
not
syrupy
or
thick
all
around
a
very
tasty
brew
i
enjoyed
the
beer
on
a
cold
night
and
it
seemed
to
go
very
well
d
very
nice
drinkability
with
a
spicy
alcohol
and
fruitiness

this
is
a
good
beer
and
perhaps
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
ive
tried
given
its
lofty
status
i
honestly
was
expecting
more
its
definitely
a
good
beer
and
certainly
should
be
featured
on
any
bas
resume
but
world
class
i
cant
go
that
far
d
a
nice
drink
that
could
be
had
in
quantity
nothing
to
spectacular
to
make
it
extraordinary
though
o
this
is
good
although
i
cant
say
i
like
it
more
or
less
than
optimator
or
salvator
all
three
are
just
so
different
that
its
hard
to
compare
them
this
one
has
a
lot
of
belgian
qualities
to
it
from
the
smell
to
the
stinging
carbonation
and
dry
finish
very
clean
flavor
thats
quite
tasty
without
doing
too
much
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
something
i
would
definitely
drink
again
good
beer
all
around
but
not
the
greatest
things
thats
happened
to
humanity
as
some
would
suggest
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
the
body
is
a
deep
red
when
held
to
the
light
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
some
coffee
nice
aroma
the
taste
is
a
nice
combination
of
sweet
malt
coffee
and
raisins
slight
bitterness
comes
in
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
medium
to
full
bodied
very
drinkable
but
filling
overall
a
delicious
and
complex
beer
d
this
is
probably
my
favorite
doppelbock
very
high
drinkability
it
is
just
such
an
easy
beer
to
drink
highly
recommended
d
i
ended
the
night
with
this
one
and
it
was
a
great
time
to
try
it
for
the
first
time
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
definitely
turn
to
it
again
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
doppelbock
d
my
best
overall
bock
experience
so
far
the
official
gold
rimmed
glass
makes
it
even
better
medium
to
fullbodied
not
particularly
carbonated
not
quite
smooth
but
certainly
easy
to
drink
its
almost
hard
to
keep
from
drinking
this
too
fast

a

indeed
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
although
i
probably
wouldnt
find
myself
drinking
it
on
a
regular
basis
i
liked
it
much
better
than
on
cask
although
i
think
the
liters
of
oktoberfest
i
had
before
might
have
had
a
bit
of
effect
on
my
judgement
its
a
fairly
enjoyable
beer
with
lots
of
big
complex
flavors
i
tried
a
second
bottle
yesterday
it
was
much
better
the
second
time
around
for
me
than
the
first
the
taste
was
still
a
little
weak
but
it
was
good
for
its
style
i
would
say
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
better
this
time
around
as
was
the
smell
still
not
my
favorite
but
its
a
top
100
overall
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
out
there
very
drinkable
ver
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
chewy
the
carbo
is
fairly
lightly
done
and
the
aftertaste
lingers
on
for
some
time
and
thats
a
plus
best
darn
doppelbock
ive
ever
tasted
and
i
couldnt
recommend
it
more
another
great
product
from
ayinger
overall
i
would
rate
this
beer
a
4
5
out
of
5
d
my
second
doublebock
and
this
one
is
to
be
reckoned
with
this
is
truly
a
masterpiece
do
not
drink
more
than
2
of
these
in
a
sitting
unless
you
want
to
fall
asleep
drinkability
a
very
enjoyable
doppelbock
and
honestly
the
best
one
ive
tried
goes
down
great
and
taste
delicious
flavor
is
equally
as
impressive
with
a
huge
fruitymalt
backbone
matched
up
with
a
surprisingly
strong
alcohol
note
brown
sugar
and
sweet
bread
mouthfeel
is
above
average
with
a
creamy
yet
crisp
consistency
a
great
carbonation
level
and
a
nice
bitter
finish
definately
a
complex
flavorful
beer
ill
surely
have
again
another
fine
beer
provided
by
chef
pauls
bavarian
lodge
poured
a
dark
brown
as
close
to
black
as
i
think
you
can
get
withour
being
there
nice
thick
light
brown
head
that
settled
to
a
neat
ring
around
the
level
of
the
beer
after
a
few
moments
smell
was
of
dark
chocolatey
roasted
malt
toffee
and
a
distinct
plumraisin
essence
i
ordered
this
beer
after
dinner
and
it
smelled
like
i
had
made
a
great
decision
the
elevated
abv
seemed
not
to
overpower
but
rather
to
deliver
the
flavors
to
the
tongue
while
wafting
into
the
nasal
cavity
from
the
back
of
the
throat
kind
of
an
awkward
anatomical
description
but
hard
to
explain
otherwise
very
sensuous
silky
and
sweet
i
sipped
this
beer
for
about
20
minutes
and
enjoyed
every
second
great
beer
good
beer
that
could
be
sipped
on
for
quite
some
time
could
drink
about
3
or
4
of
these
depending
on
the
mood
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
a
while
mostly
because
it
comes
with
a
free
toy
a
small
plastic
ram
a
happy
meal
for
boozehounds
ive
seen
it
on
the
shelf
for
ages
but
have
never
picked
it
up
until
now
a
pours
a
really
gorgeous
deep
opaque
brown
when
i
started
pouring
it
looked
like
there
would
be
nearly
no
head
but
as
i
continued
i
soon
got
a
nice
thick
beige
layer
of
foam
that
left
behind
some
nice
lacing
s
roasted
malts
chocolate
spice
some
whiffs
of
earthy
hops
pretty
mouthwatering
t
chocolate
and
toffee
up
front
some
darker
fruit
the
hops
providing
a
beautifully
clean
finish
from
the
smell
i
was
a
bit
concerned
the
sweetness
would
be
overpowering
but
theres
a
near
perfect
balance
m
thick
chewy
long
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
as
i
continue
through
the
glass
it
continues
to
reveal
itself
im
definitely
picking
up
this
one
again
a
really
fantastic
beer
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
huge
light
brown
head

tight
bubbles
and
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
caramel
initially
with
malt
and
chocolate
notes
following
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
once
again
caramel
and
chocolate
are
quite
apparent
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
almost
chewy
the
alcohol
has
a
warming
effect
that
is
not
overpowering
this
is
a
delicious
beer

cant
believe
ive
taken
this
long
to
try
it
a
very
well
balanced
beer
considering
the
depth
of
complexity
in
flavors
aromas
of
molasses
dates
malt
mouthfeel
is
smooth
punctuated
by
firm
by
elegant
carbonation
taste
is
rich
with
dark
dried
fruit
coffee
hints
of
dark
chocolate
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
very
well
crafted
although
perhaps
not
one
of
the
more
bold
and
intense
doppelbocks
as
others
have
noted
this
really
is
the
mother
of
all
dopplebocks
first
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
humpys
during
the
fur
rhondy
festival
in
anchorage
99
or
2000
forget
now
when
it
was
first
brought
into
the
state
it
was
excellent
then
and
is
excellent
now
always
a
treat
this
is
an
excellent
beer
celebrator
pours
a
nice
deep
dark
brown
with
a
bunch
of
ruby
highlights
and
a
sticky
off
white
head
that
does
a
lot
of
lacing
the
smell
is
dark
fruit
plums
grapes
red
wine
a
touch
of
dark
bread
and
just
a
hint
of
spicy
alcohol
the
taste
is
molasses
and
dark
grain
without
all
the
bitterness
dark
fruity
sweetness
rounded
out
with
a
bit
of
spicy
hops
and
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
chewy
full
the
finish
is
slightly
drying
but
there
are
plenty
of
residual
sugars
and
a
lingering
fruityness
a
pretty
amazing
beer
in
a
way
it
is
reminiscent
of
an
english
ris
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
a
real
winner
on
the
light
side
body
wise
for
a
doubble
bock
suprizingly
smooth
and
drinkable
has
some
characteristics
remisent
of
a
english
style
ale
enjoyable
experiance
a
must
try
beer
in
my
book
d
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
the
top
two
doppelbocks
on
the
planet
sweet
and
earthy
and
so
very
malty
an
excellent
treat
d
be
careful
with
it
one
after
a
really
long
day
in
the
kitchen
makes
me
realize
why
i
love
beer
but
any
more
than
that
and
the
next
day
could
be
rough
notes
ill
be
picking
this
one
up
again
and
again
at
the
store
at
the
bar
where
ever
thank
you
ayinger
for
brewing
this
masterpiece
the
price
and
hype
made
me
cautious
which
is
why
i
waited
a
long
time
to
indulge
in
this
dont
make
the
same
mistake
this
is
my
first
doppelbock
and
it
has
certainly
set
the
bar
high
huge
fluffy
brown
head
that
tastes
chocolatey
and
smooth
and
lasts
for
the
entire
glass
very
strong
complex
flavor
chocolate
coffee
malt
etc
the
flavor
doesnt
stop
so
much
going
on
it
disguises
the
alcohol
taste
wonderfully
even
though
it
has
a
high
abv
wonderful
to
the
last
drop
certainly
a
new
favorite
of
mine
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
head
that
doesnt
stay
around
for
long
smells
very
malty
and
strong
taste
is
much
of
the
same
except
that
it
takes
on
a
roasted
coffeelike
essence
that
goes
down
nicely
and
leaves
a
good
aftertaste
i
really
like
bocks
anyway
and
this
one
is
no
exception
its
nice
malty
and
strong
to
boot
exactly
what
the
style
implies
very
very
good
beer
havent
had
a
beer
this
complex
in
a
while
definatly
recommend
trying
this
beer
in
fact
im
kind
of
wishing
i
had
bought
more
than
just
one
of
these
cant
really
think
of
a
beer
id
rather
have
this
is
what
other
beers
want
to
be
pours
a
clear
dark
mahogany
color
a
hard
pour
produces
a
big
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
a
light
covering
of
the
glass
minimum
head
the
nose
hints
at
sweetness
and
dark
fruit
quite
pronounced
and
good
the
actual
taste
delivers
the
sweetness
and
fruit
but
the
predominant
flavor
is
malt
as
a
hophead
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
i
was
impressed
with
the
bigness
of
flavor
in
a
beer
that
is
not
a
complete
high
octane
abv
bomb
this
one
gets
your
attention
like
a
belgian
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
the
flavors
are
more
balanced
if
you
let
the
beer
warm
up
as
you
sip
it
drinkability
is
good
would
be
very
good
for
someone
that
appreciates
malty
beers
more
d
i
didnt
what
this
one
to
end
and
i
got
happier
with
it
the
further
along
i
got
into
drinking
it
the
only
qualm
i
have
with
this
one
is
that
it
felt
a
little
flat
on
the
tongue
other
than
that
this
one
is
perfect
on
the
inside
beautiful
rich
brown
color
with
ruby
tint
in
the
light
aroma
of
sweet
dark
roasted
malt
taste
of
dark
malt
and
raisin
and
a
hint
of
smoke
the
flavor
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
but
you
still
know
you
are
drinking
a
substantial
beer
excellent
the
head
was
something
that
i
only
dream
about
the
light
brown
head
dissipated
as
the
sticky
lace
etched
a
beautiful
pattern
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
of
tons
of
malts
that
i
could
smell
even
through
my
stuffed
nose
with
a
hint
of
tart
fruitiness
and
a
flash
of
the
alcohol
the
taste
was
exceptional
with
sweet
malts
up
front
overwhelming
the
taste
buds
and
a
surprisingly
dry
and
tart
finish
but
the
mouthfeel
in
my
mind
takes
the
cake
because
it
literally
felt
like
chewing
on
malt
syrup
the
alcohol
gradually
crept
up
and
warmed
my
esophagus
but
my
mouth
was
just
left
wanting
more
extremely
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
but
has
just
the
right
amount
of
presence
so
you
know
youre
not
drinking
a
light
beer
a
brew
worthy
of
celebration
indeed

a

from
a
brown
11
2
ounce
bottle
that
had
a
plastic
goat
strung
around
the
neck
of
the
bottle
there
is
a
rich
sweet
dark
malty
aroma
the
flavor
is
smoky
and
malty
if
one
doesnt
have
a
taste
for
smoked
beers
this
could
be
a
challenge
the
mouthfeel
is
just
right
a
bit
on
the
thick
side
a
world
classic
d
at
only
6
7
abv
it
seems
like
a
bigger
beer
nap
inducing
but
its
so
good
if
you
can
stay
awake
you
wont
want
to
stop
i
cant
imagine
a
better
double
this
one
is
good
for
all
occasions
and
stands
as
a
classic
i
keep
the
ram
hung
on
my
rear
view
to
pay
homage
to
this
great
beer
a
classic
beer
the
epitome
of
the
style
overall
flavorful
and
drinkable
very
enjoyable
pours

thick
roasty

smoky

undertone
in
the
finish
along
with
more

sweetness
aftertaste
is
clean
and
slightly
bitter
just
an
all
around
great
beer
this
is
just
my
opinion
but
damn
near
perfect
for
a
dopple
this
is
my
new
favorite
i
had
it
in
a
local
place
that
takes
pride
in
their
german
food
and
beer
it
was
a
recomendation
from
the
bartender
that
he
hit
out
of
the
park
thanks
more
cowbell
see
below
pours
a
very
dark
almost
black
brown
with
a
creamy
tan
colored
head
that
refuses
to
disappear
malts
and
more
malts
in
the
nose
there
is
a
very
faint
roasted
scent
but
far
removed
from
the
roasted
scents
youd
find
in
a
stout
smooth
as
velvet
mouthfeel
with
very
fine
carbonation
almost
syrupy
malted
taste
with
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
bitterness
and
malts
meld
into
one
beautiful
flavor
finishing
dry
i
love
to
use
this
as
a
marinade
if
i
can
find
courage
enough
to
part
with
a
bottle
drinkabilty
is
excellent
i
would
drink
it
all
the
time
if
it
were
a
bit
cheaper
d
i
cant
imagine
an
occasion
that
wouldnt
benefit
from
this
beer
even
breakfast
almost
too
drinkable
i
could
see
killing
a
sixer
of
this
and
passing
out
good
thing
i
dont
have
a
sixer
but
i
do
wish
i
had
another
cheers
guys
i
am
new
to
the
doppelbock
style
so
i
cannot
compare
it
to
its
kindred
as
a
standalone
example
i
was
very
pleased
very
drinkable
it
goes
down
easy
but
its
complexity
demands
your
attention
definitely
worth
trying
and
a
great
beer
to
give
to
anyone
who
claims
not
to
like
lagers
this
is
the
best
of
any
bock
or
doppelbock
i
have
ever
had
it
has
convinced
me
to
expand
myself
away
from
ales
more
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
nevertheless
disappointing
either
this
has
been
dumbed
down
in
the
couple
of
years
since
i
had
it
or
ive
learned
to
expect
more
either
way
if
theres
another
doppelbock
available
ill
be
reaching
for
it
before
grabbing
this
one
again
pours
a
beautiful
deep
brown
almost
black
with
a
robust
tan
head
that
fades
to
some
lacing
the
smell
was
sweet
almost
fig
with
coffee
hints
the
taste
was
very
good
cream
coffee
grain
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
smooth
slightly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
was
very
good
this
is
a
beer
i
like
to
savor
for
a
while
but
its
highly
drinkable
just
because
of
the
richness
its
not
a
brew
i
could
have
too
many
of
in
a
sitting
i
won
a
friendly
poker
game
last
night
so
this
beer
seemed
like
a
good
choice
for
a
nightcap
due
to
the
name
i
poured
it
into
an
oversized
arrogant
bastard
glass
and
realized
the
glass
was
just
like
the
celebrator
glass
only
huge
it
was
a
serious
dark
brown
with
ruby
edges
and
a
frothy
tan
head
the
smell
was
roasty
toasty
and
malty
the
taste
was
toasty
and
i
swear
i
detected
licorice
in
there
this
was
a
good
beer
but
i
think
it
tastes
better
on
tap
it
is
also
a
little
pricey
at
3
for
11oz
still
one
of
the
best
german
beers
i
have
tried
drink
this
now
and
then
drink
it
again
d
very
drinkable
but
watch
your
enthusiam
because
they
aint
cheap
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
dopplebock
one
that
i
will
try
again
this
is
one
hell
of
a
smooth
yet
complex
beer
there
are
definite
notes
of
dark
fruits
coffee
some
chocolate
and
even
a
subtle
hop
presence
much
more
enjoyable
as
it
warmed
up
mouthfeel
was
fullbodied
and
well
carbonated
even
though
it
was
a
touch
on
the
heavy
side
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
this
really
is
a
great
and
interesting
beer
experience
bottle
poured
a
ruby
read
with
a
medium
but
attractive
tan
head
and
good
lacing
nose
is
fantastic
with
fruits
citrus
and
chocolate
and
just
a
little
coffee
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
flavor
of
chocolate
coffee
and
toast
but
not
burnt
toast
a
remarkable
brew
slightly
dry
finish
with
a
nice
touch
of
hops
best
dopplebock
ever
for
me
perhaps
as
good
as
it
gets
with
regard
to
imported
biers
this
is
the
best
of
the
best
when
it
comes
to
this
style
smooth
luscious
yet
full
of
aromas
and
flavors
without
being
overpowering
the
closest
thing
to
perfection
in
a
bottle
drinkability
dangerously
drinkable
this
is
one
fine
doppel
i
will
very
much
have
this
as
part
of
my
stable
of
offerings
i
only
hope
my
guests
are
worth
it
d
a
really
great
dopplebock
it
is
very
sweet
and
chocolatey
d
theres
a
reason
it
comes
in
four
packs
any
more
than
four
of
these
is
simply
too
much
still
it
tastes
so
damn
good
its
hard
to
drink
just
one
bonus
the
fantastic
little
goat
charms
you
get
when
you
buy
celebrator
its
like
the
bygone
era
when
cracker
jacks
used
to
have
good
toys
in
them
also
you
get
drunk
so
all
in
all
an
awesome
beer
and
a
great
experience
poured
almost
black
into
a
celebrator
glass
with
a
off
white
head
that
went
away
quickly
aroma
of
coffee
chocolate
and
small
amout
of
alcohol
smooth
taste
including
coffee
and
chocolate
a
very
nice
double
bock
used
to
be
the
good
old
stand
by
but
the
alcohol
was
a
thing
to
watch
with
this
one
had
two
over
the
course
of
a
weekend
first
was
maybe
a
little
to
warm
and
i
had
had
one
or
two
other
beers
before
so
it
didnt
do
much
for
me
2nd
had
a
day
or
so
in
the
frig
no
beer
before
much
better
as
with
most
of
my
reviews
dbocks
are
new
to
me
so
cant
really
compare
by
style
it
was
good
but
after
hearing
all
the
hype
maybe
i
expected
more
nose
was
malty
bready
not
much
actually
taste
was
balanced
leaning
on
sweet
very
drinkable
didnt
fill
to
heavy
reasonably
priced
if
it
were
available
here
i
would
drink
again
i
put
this
one
off
for
a
long
time
largely
because
of
its
pricetoalcohol
ratio
it
proved
to
a
huge
mistake
as
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
most
deliecious
beers
ive
tasted
a
must
try
often
buy
in
my
book
for
sure
id
drink
it
all
the
time
overall
this
is
a
soft
tasty
doppelbock
the
flavors
are
layered
and
overwhelming
and
i
can
see
why
this
is
the
most
appreciated
doppelbock
out
there
its
hard
to
describe
but
put
simply
it
leaves
a
happy
feeling
in
my
mouth
this
one
is
quite
drinkable
and
at
6
7
abv
a
person
could
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
in
a
session
dperfect
for
a
springfall
evening
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
this
is
my
first
this
will
be
in
my
rotation
d
this
is
an
amazing
beer
first
time
ive
tried
it
and
im
hooked
overall
very
drinkable
and
a
fine
example
of
germany
in
a
glass
really
nice
brew
pours
nice
and
dark
brown
some
red
highlights
smells
of
sweet
malt
possibly
some
dark
fruit
notes
buttery
smooth
taste
caramel
like
sweetness
slight
fruit
in
the
finish
very
smooth
not
as
syrupy
as
i
guess
i
would
have
expected
not
that
im
complaining
this
is
one
hell
of
a
brew
right
on
for
the
style
very
nice
beer
overall
my
first
tasting
of
this
beer
was
after
i
had
a
local
craft
bock
that
has
a
bit
more
hops
and
a
lot
more
toasty
character
when
i
tried
the
celebrator
it
seemed
like
a
syrupy
mess
however
on
a
clean
palette
this
is
a
whole
different
story
now
i
see
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
splendid
complex
in
its
simplicity
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
recommended
smell
is
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
some
molasses
and
caramel
malts
very
appealing
those
aromas
dont
disappoint
in
the
taste
which
is
a
wonderfully
sweet
and
complex
combination
of
malty
goodness
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
to
create
a
perfectly
balanced
and
incredibly
delicious
brew
mouthfeel
is
superb
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
creamy
full
body
amazing
brew
and
the
best
doppel
ive
ever
tasted
had
this
one
once
before
and
was
blown
away
finally
now
getting
to
review
the
deliciousness
this
one
really
blows
the
other
doppelbocks
ive
had
out
of
the
park
pours
an
incredible
dark
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
on
top
that
dissolves
at
a
good
pace
nose
is
mild
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
taste
is
amazing
lots
of
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
with
a
good
lager
hops
kick
at
the
end
really
a
tasty
beer
feel
is
good
good
thickness
especially
for
a
lager
overall
a
fantastic
lager
that
i
would
and
will
definitely
have
again
great
extremely
drinkable
i
need
more
of
this
very
good
but
not
extremely
drinkable
poured
brown
from
the
bottle
with
about
an
inch
of
head
the
head
dissipated
quickly
and
almost
completely
leaving
just
a
slight
ring
around
the
edge
smell
was
sweet
and
alcoholic
i
dont
know
how
to
describe
the
taste
exactly
its
sweet
up
front
followed
by
a
kick
of
funkiness
that
is
strange
and
unfamiliar
to
me
theres
a
bit
of
solvent
and
steel
in
the
taste
i
think
the
first
part
of
each
sip
is
good
but
the
back
end
doesnt
suit
me
d
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
stronger
than
its
smell
and
taste
give
off
great
beer
for
someone
looking
to
explore
doppelbocks
not
sessionable
but
definitly
worth
a
cool
sip
d
although
its
perhaps
a
bit
sweet
for
drinking
a
bunch
of
them
it
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
doppelbock
dark
in
appearance
near
black
tough
to
see
through
even
when
held
to
light
thick
creamy
head
with
some
decent
lacing
lovely
smell
with
sweet
fruits
and
some
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
some
alcohol
great
taste
with
the
chocolate
making
its
presence
felt
in
this
dark
version
of
the
style
alcohol
present
once
again
but
faint
and
actually
helps
create
some
balance
sweet
malts
also
come
through
medium
to
full
bodied
mouthfeel
that
is
smooth
and
creamy
silky
even
not
the
greatest
drinkability
but
still
up
there
in
the
good
ranks
i
would
recommend
this
highly
well
worth
the
price
d
not
a
session
beer
but
very
good
for
the
style
di
could
drink
this
all
day
the
relatively
high
abv
means
i
probably
should
not
but
its
very
very
good
smooth
and
tasty
what
more
could
you
want
d
pretty
good
beer
wouldnt
consider
it
a
session
beer
but
1
worked
out
just
about
right
not
really
all
that
drinkable
but
great
for
afterdinner
sipping
d
may
be
respected
in
small
doses
like
a
truffle
with
its
rich
character
and
lasting
residual
sweetness
almost
a
meal
on
its
own
it
has
a
fullness
and
chewiness
that
makes
for
a
lager
for
special
occasions
like
any
day
it
is
available
dgood
beer
i
imagine
this
would
be
simply
delicious
on
tap
quite
dark
brown
color
slight
burgundy
highlights
very
big
and
bready
aroma
some
pepper
and
caramel
sweetness
in
the
hopmalt
profile
this
is
a
tasty
doppelbock
very
sweet
with
a
little
hop
spicing
and
big
malt
presence
this
is
a
sipper
and
a
classic
pat
at
finger
lakes
beverage
in
ithaca
recommended
this
for
me
to
try
as
he
said
its
the
best
dopplebock
around
i
was
attracted
to
the
nice
little
goat
charm
this
is
one
amazing
looking
beer
very
dark
ruby
appearance
with
a
wonderful
dark
khaki
colored
head
that
remains
throughout
entire
tasting
with
a
medium
grainy
lace
smell
is
of
a
nutty
chocolate
with
a
toasted
malt
undertone
very
pleasant
smell
taste
follows
up
quite
well
after
the
amazing
odor
lots
of
malt
very
sweet
bready
flavors
brown
sugar
raisin
as
well
little
to
no
alcohol
bite
which
i
enjoy
such
a
smooth
enjoyable
brew
that
has
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
to
it
but
doesnt
distract
from
its
overall
balance
this
beer
left
me
speechless
i
highly
recommend
this
no
matter
what
kind
of
beer
you
prefer
i
have
a
new
respect
for
dopplebocks
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
thank
you
pat
from
finger
lakes
beverage
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
smooth
and
creamy
on
the
palate
lower
carbonation
of
this
brew
accentuates
the
complex
flavors
this
brew
is
real
easy
to
drink
could
easily
drink
this
without
getting
tired
of
it
the
body
is
a
bit
thinner
than
what
i
would
have
expected
however
it
is
still
full
bodied
finishes
more
on
the
drier
side
once
one
has
sat
without
taking
another
sip
for
a
few
moments
a
great
doppelbock
but
for
the
price
of
4
of
these
id
probably
rather
buy
bells
or
spatens
doppelbock
you
know
more
bang
for
the
buck
but
i
guess
if
i
want
to
splurge
then
id
buy
these
overall
its
very
deserving
of
the
praise
it
has
gotten
and
it
is
very
close
to
what
i
expected
i
am
satisfied
and
will
definitely
be
getting
more
of
this
in
the
future
d
overall
the
only
negative
i
have
is
that
it
needed
more
carbonation
to
give
a
fuller
feel
and
better
set
off
the
flavors
it
was
very
drinkable
however
as
nothing
overwhelmed
you
and
it
never
came
off
as
too
thick
very
nice
relaxing
nightcap
for
me
i
picked
this
up
at
the
willamette
market
of
choice
eugene
or
it
pours
out
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
some
faint
red
hints
its
got
a
thin
bubbly
head
thats
tanbrown
and
long
lasting
not
much
lacing
it
doesnt
smell
too
strongly
just
a
bit
bitter
but
mostly
a
sweet
smell
the
taste
is
slightly
acidicbitter
up
front
but
then
erupts
into
a
roasty
sweet
chocolate
taste
on
the
end
which
dominates
the
aftertaste
very
drinkable
and
delicious
nice
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
sweet
roast
plus
its
got
a
funky
little
goat
necklace
for
some
reason
you
dont
find
too
many
beers
with
necklaces
pours
a
cocacola
color
into
glass
with
no
head
no
lacing
left
behind
aroma
is
chocolate
at
first
and
then
roasted
malts
taste
is
dark
fruits
and
sugar
up
front
carmel
malts
give
way
to
roasted
flavor
and
slight
alcohol
burn
as
it
goes
down
aftertaste
is
primarily
roastiness
and
alcohol
good
beer
not
great
i
do
not
have
enough
experience
in
the
style
to
say
how
it
stacks
up
to
the
competiton
d
without
a
doubt
the
most
drinkable
double
bock
ive
ever
had
its
not
quite
as
sweet
as
most
brews
of
the
style
and
i
just
cant
get
enough
the
awesome
hops
that
do
such
a
nice
job
of
balancing
everything
out
also
this
brew
has
a
somewhat
lower
abv
than
most
doppelbocks
which
makes
it
an
excellent
session
beer
if
you
feel
like
having
a
few
my
local
grocer
just
started
getting
this
beer
it
tastes
so
good
i
forgot
the
expensive
price
already
very
drinkable
on
the
rare
wonderful
occasion
when
i
have
more
than
one
it
is
quite
filling
after
a
while
so
good
tastes
great
feels
great
looks
perfect
this
beer
was
very
full
bodied
dark
brown
with
a
very
adequate
head
smell
was
smoky
bocky
goodness
the
taste
had
almost
a
soy
sauciness
that
worked
very
well
actually
much
more
drinkable
to
me
than
other
bocks
ive
had
this
is
a
quality
bock
i
really
dug
this
beer
cant
wait
to
have
another
drinkability
nice
bock
would
buy
it
againnice
looking
beer
with
its
large
head
again
to
be
fair
i
had
it
on
tap
a
long
distance
from
where
it
was
brewed
perhaps
ill
sample
it
again
if
i
make
it
back
to
bavaria
unfortunately
writing
this
review
too
long
after
the
fact
but
here
goes
poured
a
beatiful
dark
brown
with
a
nice
thick
head
aroma
was
redolant
of
chocolate
dark
almost
burnt
caramel
malts
toasted
bread
espresso
and
honey
taste
was
kind
of
like
drinking
a
nice
dark
bread
with
a
nice
residual
sweetness
and
enough
understated
hops
to
provide
great
balance
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
but
that
does
not
do
it
justice
i
just
cant
bring
myself
to
say
something
feels
great
in
my
mouth
despite
my
avatar
drinkability
is
great
for
a
beer
of
this
abv
ayinger
really
knows
how
to
showcase
complex
clean
malt
flavors
drinkability
very
well
balanced
doppelbock
thats
complex
but
easy
to
appreciate
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
decent
head
settles
fairly
quickly
dark
choclatey
amber
color
smells
slightly
reminiscent
of
molasses
or
rum
very
malty
tastes
id
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
hops
to
balance
it
out
feels
very
thick
in
the
mouth
not
fizzy
very
full
bodied
a
decent
enough
beer
and
from
what
ive
read
a
decent
enough
member
of
the
style
but
for
some
reason
i
enjoyed
a
samichlaus
much
more
pours
a
nice
mohagany
amber
with
a
thick
creamy
off
white
head
aroma
of
chocolate
malt
and
fruits
taste
has
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
with
a
full
bodied
creamy
mouthfeel
a
good
drinker
going
down
smooth
leaving
a
roasted
malt
bitter
aftertaste
a
great
doppelbock
to
try
and
another
one
to
for
me
to
try
again
da
very
east
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
at
6
7
it
still
remains
easy
it
pours
thick
into
a
pilsner
glass
with
a
dark
brown
color
it
has
a
very
nice
aroma
of
chocolate
covered
raisins
and
brown
sugar
similar
taste
too
and
very
well
balanced
not
overwhelmingly
malty
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
on
slowly
why
spend
your
money
on
a
forty
when
you
can
enjoy
this
for
the
same
price
d
hype
surrounding
this
brew
may
just
be
credible
i
really
enjoyed
this
good
brew
recommended
a
great
beer
even
if
you
think
the
styles
not
for
you
wow
it
posseses
a
buttery
complex
flavour
with
a
lighthoppiness
and
toasty
breadlike
undertones
it
finishes
as
well
as
it
starts
and
will
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
one
of
my
favorites
a
musttry
beer
experience
smooth
and
falvorful
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
worlds
best
beers
thinner
than
i
would
like
from
such
a
fulltasting
beer
but
still
creamy
enough
on
the
finish
to
make
for
a
more
than
satisfying
drink
not
something
i
could
pack
a
ton
away
of
but
a
great
great
german
beer
a
real
treat
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
huge
3
finger
head
after
an
aggressive
pour
that
goes
no
where
for
a
while
then
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
everywhere
color
is
a
dark
reddish
brown
almost
like
iced
tea
smell
is
totally
roasted
malt
with
a
little
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
and
maybe
a
little
fruitiness
as
well
taste
is
sweet
and
roasty
up
front
a
little
milk
chocolate
and
coffee
bitterness
in
the
back
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
mouthfeel
is
perfect
not
too
carbonated
but
enough
to
carry
the
complexity
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
have
with
any
german
food
brats
sauerkraut
spaetzle
etc
drink
it
often
its
good
stuff
highest
recommendation
a
great
great
beer
the
mother
of
all
doppelbocks
and
a
real
treat
to
pick
one
up
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
bock
low
abv
allows
one
to
enjoy
3
or
4
over
a
couple
of
hours
either
with
a
meal
or
after
a
meal
with
a
good
cigar
perfect
taste
is
flavorful
nice
complexity
very
similar
to
the
smell
slightly
more
earthy
there
is
a
mild
syrupy
character
to
this
which
i
like
the
bitterness
is
perfect
keeps
it
refreshing
and
interesting
and
balances
malty
goodness
perfectly
the
mouth
feel
is
great
because
it
is
lighter
but
it
has
flavor
attributes
of
a
stout
its
refreshing
and
hearty
not
cloying
or
over
bearing
on
the
palate
magnificent
this
has
great
potential
to
be
both
a
winter
drink
and
a
summer
drink
very
quenching
its
really
good
maybe
too
good
i
could
drink
these
from
sun
up
to
sun
down
this
is
one
beer
that
will
be
finding
an
immediate
home
in
my
fridges
permanent
selection
celebrator
is
a
truly
well
made
doppelbock
that
deserves
the
praise
it
gets
i
will
continue
to
revisit
this
winter
favorite
often
good
beer
clean
and
tasty
i
had
one
could
have
had
two
but
decided
to
have
my
own
doppelbock
d
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
a
little
rich
but
this
is
a
nice
treat
d
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
by
far
the
best
dopplebock
that
i
have
tried
to
date
complex
and
enjoyable
a
well
crafted
beer
recommended
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
a
dark
brown
with
a
red
hue
one
finger
of
light
tan
foam
smells
of
cocoa
and
nuts
tastes
of
caramel
brown
sugar
tangy
citrus
fruits
and
chocolate
smooth
and
full
bodied
finishes
dry
with
notes
of
bitter
cocoa
and
nuts
a
well
balanced
rich
beer
d
i
could
drink
this
baby
all
day
long
its
thick
but
not
thick
enough
to
disturb
the
drinkability
this
is
my
first
double
bock
and
one
of
the
best
of
that
style
cant
wait
to
try
others
of
this
style
this
beer
gets
some
high
reviews
and
must
be
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
just
have
to
conclude
that
dopplebocks
are
not
my
thing
drinkability
not
really
my
style
of
beer
so
its
hard
to
say
one
is
more
than
enough
for
me
dark
brown
not
quite
opaque
small
but
lingering
tan
head
has
that
signature
doppelbock
taste
and
smell
roasted
and
toasted
malts
chocolate
bit
of
smoke
rather
dry
and
light
for
the
style
velvety
mouthfeel
mediumbodied
like
a
porter
and
crisply
carbonated
fantastic
beer
everyday
with
brews
like
this
a
great
brew
that
i
will
be
going
back
to
over
and
over
d
well
all
my
friend
yelterdows
championing
of
this
beer
was
definitely
in
the
right
place
this
is
an
amazing
dopplebock
nuff
said
less
typing
more
sipping
this
beer
is
the
real
deal
this
doppelbock
has
the
kind
of
heavy
malt
flavor
that
i
crave
in
my
beer
pours
into
my
glass
a
smooth
uncarbonated
cola
color
with
a
nice
rich
half
inch
light
brown
head
smelled
of
heavy
dark
malt
with
hints
of
toffee
the
beer
tasted
of
heavy
roasted
malt
with
subtle
nutty
traces
and
a
pleasantly
bitter
aftertaste
this
beer
coated
the
mouth
well
with
its
medium
body
and
multiple
bottles
can
easily
be
consumed
in
one
night
i
paired
this
with
a
port
salut
semisoft
mild
french
cheese
and
i
cant
get
enough
enjoy
appearance
is
a
very
dark
amber
color
the
doppelbock
was
poured
into
a
glass
the
initial
12
inch
head
died
down
very
quickly
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
nutty
although
not
overpowering
the
taste
and
mouth
feel
is
where
this
beer
really
comes
to
life
it
is
very
sweet
when
first
hitting
the
tongue
but
after
lingering
for
a
bit
the
spiciness
of
this
beer
comes
through
this
is
an
excellent
doppelbock
i
will
definitely
have
another
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
with
acceptable
head
as
well
as
good
lacing
initial
taste
is
sweet
and
smooth
then
leading
to
a
nutty
slightly
fruit
richness
about
onethird
down
the
glass
i
noticed
a
caramel
taste
aftertaste
maintains
a
burnt
and
bittery
pre
dominance
goes
great
with
a
hearty
bratwurst
mouthfeel
is
full
creamy
and
velvety
and
drinkability
is
remarkable
a
nice
overall
package
wavz
2007
i
was
swirling
this
beer
in
my
mouth
when
time
slammed
through
2007
on
new
years
screw
that
kissing
nonsense
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
packed
with
flavor
it
would
be
great
withfor
dessert
or
a
hearty
meal
pours
a
lovely
dark
brownish
nearly
black
color
with
a
nice
coffee
colored
head
smells
of
chocolate
coffee
and
spicey
malt
tastes
just
like
it
smell
nice
and
full
bodied
spice
on
the
backend
of
that
wonderful
bread
flavor
i
can
feel
myself
getting
all
the
nutrients
i
need
today
very
very
good
i
will
certainly
be
back
for
another
of
these
md
feels
really
smooth
not
too
heavy
in
the
mouth
or
the
stomach
i
could
drink
this
over
an
extended
period
of
time
my
goat
pendant
necklace
is
certain
to
be
the
envy
of
the
neighborhood
drinkabilty
i
wont
have
this
in
heavy
rotation
but
one
in
a
while
its
a
good
one
to
have
on
second
string
finish
leaves
a
bit
of
peaty
aftertaste
not
really
my
type
of
beer
but
it
is
good
perhaps
the
most
wellbalanced
dopplebock
ive
had
to
date
celebrator
butts
heads
with
the
best
of
them
its
pricey
but
worth
it
if
you
buy
it
and
dislike
it
at
the
end
of
the
day
youre
still
ahead
by
a
few
small
plastic
goats
how
many
other
beers
can
boast
that
the
carbonation
and
medium
body
were
perfect
making
for
a
smoothdrinking
experience
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
but
provides
a
bit
of
warmth
which
made
this
an
ideal
indulgence
as
i
relaxed
over
the
christmas
holidays
drinking
this
beer
makes
you
aware
of
its
fragrance
color
and
consistency
you
cant
help
but
be
aware
of
it
all
as
you
drink
it
an
outstanding
beer
all
the
way
around
man
this
beer
is
good
and
comforting
medium
body
and
carbonation
and
pretty
darn
drinkable
a
very
nice
doppelbock
that
i
find
to
be
enjoyable
however
it
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
typically
prefer
this
type
of
beer
still
its
definitely
something
to
try
overall
a
very
clean
malty
lager
with
surprising
balance
rich
without
being
cloying
but
i
might
actually
want
it
slightly
shifted
in
the
malty
direction
but
that
is
a
minor
quibble
as
it
is
a
really
nice
highly
drinkable
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
mahogany
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
loaded
with
toasted
malt
dark
fruits
prunes
raisins
and
just
a
tad
bit
of
caramel
the
taste
features
toasted
malt
with
kind
of
a
nutty
chocolatey
finish
the
taste
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
would
have
liked
but
it
is
certainly
not
bad
mouthfeel
much
like
the
taste
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
would
have
liked
but
does
not
detract
from
the
beer
that
much
overall
this
is
a
fine
representation
of
the
style
and
a
beer
that
is
certainly
recommended
this
brew
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
huge
tan
head
and
sticky
lacing
aromas
of
dark
malts
and
dried
fruits
were
present
and
came
through
on
tasting
the
malts
were
huge
and
sweet
yet
cool
and
refreshing
a
great
balance
the
thickness
of
the
beer
was
offset
by
its
effect
on
the
palate
a
perfect
meal
in
a
bottle
taste
is
very
nicely
balanced
the
chocolate
toasted
malts
come
on
first
but
they
arent
overbearingly
sweet
and
are
offset
nicely
by
a
mild
lemonlike
sourness
less
fruity
than
the
nose
suggests
but
that
said
there
is
some
plumlike
sweetness
in
the
back
earthy
hops
are
present
and
subtle
just
enough
to
help
balance
this
out
finishes
dry
with
lots
of
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
thick
and
malty
and
perhaps
a
little
syrupy
but
i
dont
mind
that
carbonation
is
mild
and
befits
the
style
drinkability
is
high
for
a
few
reasons
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
bitternesssourness
sweet
but
never
too
sweet
alcohol
content
isnt
outofcontrol
slides
down
very
easily
well
done
and
probably
the
best
doppelbock
ive
had
yet
highly
recommend
this
one
its
my
first
authentic
sampling
of
the
style
and
im
intrigued
to
say
the
least
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
nice
adequate
tan
head
and
good
lacing
beer
is
a
little
colder
than
it
should
be
but
i
was
ready
so
scents
at
first
are
somewhat
muted
mouth
feel
is
silky
and
finish
is
smooth
and
dry
without
any
negative
after
taste
beer
is
coming
up
in
temp
and
so
are
scents
of
mild
caramelbrown
sugaryeast
alchohol
content
undistinguishable
that
could
be
misleading
hard
to
believe
that
this
beer
starts
incredibly
smooth
and
finishes
smoother
reafirms
for
me
why
belgian
dubbles
are
my
listed
favorite
appearance
is
nice
deep
brown
with
red
hints
decent
tan
head
nose
is
smoky
malts
and
grains
nuts
and
some
sweetness
taste
is
strong
smoky
malts
bready
goodness
and
plums
nice
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
high
a
solid
brew
very
drinkable
for
a
rich
treat
not
over
the
top
like
some
other
dopplebocks
think
sam
adams
also
very
sessionable
for
such
a
deep
rich
and
tasty
treat
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
also
a
great
way
to
introduce
someone
who
likes
date
bread
to
darker
beers
this
is
something
ill
come
back
to
again
and
again
ok
to
have
one
now
and
then
not
so
bad
but
it
is
very
filling
a
very
dark
pour
tan
head
grows
big
and
foamy
in
the
glass
looks
nice
smells
of
toffee
molasses
caramel
and
alcohol
maybe
some
sugary
dark
fruits
too
taste
is
very
very
smooth
roasty
slightly
chocolatey
hazlenuts
lots
of
roasted
smoke
flavors
more
than
i
expect
from
a
dopplebock
very
tasty
though
i
do
like
it
and
i
am
impressed
d
absolutely
great
drinking
several
of
these
would
be
a
delight
as
the
tastes
are
complex
yet
smooth
enough
to
savor
over
and
over
again
just
a
great
tasting
beer
warms
you
up
on
those
cold
winter
nights
and
seems
excellent
with
desserts
because
of
its
sweetness
12
ounce
bottle
poured
a
beautiful
mahogany
with
a
creamy
light
brown
head
that
clings
well
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
is
not
at
bold
as
i
expected
and
thats
a
let
down
for
me
prunes
and
chocolate
chew
are
the
major
player
flavors
of
smoke
chocolate
prune
juice
abound
full
body
ultra
complex
and
tastey
a
full
on
tribute
to
the
glory
of
malts
a
brown
amber
in
body
off
white
rocky
head
a
bit
frothy
smells
of
bread
and
malt
at
first
it
is
all
malt
but
not
overpoweringly
sweet
and
then
the
disapointing
part
it
turined
like
a
citrus
sour
i
hope
it
was
just
the
bottle
that
i
poured
from
and
not
representative
fo
the
beer
because
i
got
a
real
grapefruit
bitterness
in
the
end
that
i
cannot
believe
is
desired
may
try
again
due
to
reputation
but
this
was
not
good
overall
a
good
db
and
a
good
beer
but
i
dont
really
see
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
really
a
pretty
average
beer
taste
is
akind
to
the
aroma

dark
roasted
malt
coffee
and
chocolate

more
as
it
warms
the
mild
carbonation
really
lends
to
the
overall
enjoyment
of
the
flavors
in
this
one
i
can
drink
one
of
these
every
day

maybe
two

who
knows
certainly
a
great
beer
im
glad
i
finally
revisited
drinkability
conclusion
a
deliciously
complex
brew
that
while
filling
i
would
be
able
to
session
just
out
of
pure
enjoyment
i
should
have
broken
down
and
bought
this
sooner
this
has
got
to
be
in
my
top
5
favorite
beers
delicious
and
drinkable
doppelbock
but
i
wonder
if
its
worth
the
premium
price
this
reminds
me
why
i
appreciate
the
doppelbock
style
so
very
much
highly
highly
recommended
d
a
big
favorite
well
balanced
with
a
skew
toward
the
sweeter
malts
satisfying
beer
in
every
way
highly
recommended
recollections
from
last
nights
trip
to
bukowskis
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
retained
for
about
12
of
the
glass
aroma
is
mainly
roasted
malts
with
hints
of
coffee
and
slight
chocolate
taste
is
a
pleasant
variety
of
roasted
malt
flavors
coffee
caramel
and
chocolate
this
brew
is
somewhat
thick
on
the
palate
yet
it
washes
away
for
a
clean
finish
very
nice
i
wouldnt
advise
putting
down
more
then
2
or
3
of
these
in
a
sitting
though
as
this
one
will
get
to
you
fullbodied
rich
and
complex
awesome
beer
the
pour
into
my
gaffel
kolsch
glass
it
doesnt
get
used
much
so
i
figured
id
give
it
a
shot
despite
the
style
raises
a
dense
creamy
one
inch
plus
head
very
light
brown
the
lacing
is
not
much
to
speak
of
but
the
retention
is
very
impressive
the
beer
is
a
murky
dark
brown
until
backlit
when
it
becomes
a
crystalclear
deep
ruby
the
nose
is
very
malty
sweet
with
a
bit
of
dark
fruity
vinousness
caramel
toasted
malts
and
earthy
hops
just
a
tad
the
taste
is
lightly
smoky
with
deep
caramel
and
toffee
notes
a
tiny
bit
sour
too
the
mouth
is
mediumthick
with
very
low
carbonation
a
worthy
db
cheers
currently
this
is
ranked
only
third
best
within
its
style
id
like
to
meet
two
and
one
this
beer
is
truly
world
class
and
mere
words
cannot
do
it
justice
if
youve
yet
to
try
it
then
please
do
yourself
a
favor
and
do
so
asap
pours
dark
brown
with
garnett
highlights
nice
tan
head
retains
well
aroma
is
complex
sweet
malts
tastem
is
sweet
malts
and
a
roasty
almost
coffee
like
flavor
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
faint
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
this
one
is
pretty
good
but
the
high
abv
prevents
it
from
being
a
session
beer
im
not
clear
on
why
this
is
so
highly
rated
or
priced
for
that
matter
there
is
no
need
to
go
in
to
great
detail
about
why
this
doppelbock
is
so
great
have
one
for
yourself
youll
understand
thick
chewy
mouthfeel
very
warm
and
tasty
but
definitely
leaves
the
palate
dry
tasty
tasty

slight

extremely
smooth
and
velvety
warming
the
soul
what
a
good
beer
for
such
a
crappy
day
worth
all
the
praise
heaped
upon
it
d
it
is
pretty
good
not
huge
fan
of
the
dopplebock
style
though
i
think
i
prefer
the
spaten
optimator
received
a
bottle
free
from
a
friend
who
did
not
like
the
taste
of
this
brew
but
then
again
many
beers
i
have
him
try
he
does
not
take
a
liking
too
anyhow
it
poured
out
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
nice
tan
offwhite
head
very
impressive
looking
presentation
the
nice
thick
head
dissipated
slowly
and
left
very
little
lacing
in
the
pint
smells
of
roasted
malt
and
caramel
tones
had
a
rather
interesting
alcohol
aroma
almost
like
a
scotch
ale
very
smooth
roasted
flavor
awesome
malt
character
mild
hop
presence
in
the
finish
extremely
enjoyable
smooth
malted
flavor
great
mix
of
dark
and
roasted
malt
the
solid
malt
flavor
is
the
back
bone
of
this
great
thick
bodied
beer
very
impressive
and
tasty
drinkable
but
in
moderation
it
certainly
packed
a
nice
little
kick
with
it
so
it
seemed
great
overall
flavor
and
taste
i
would
certainly
give
it
another
taste
i
was
weary
trying
it
because
there
was
no
freshness
date
and
i
did
not
know
how
long
my
friend
had
it
but
after
checking
some
other
reviews
i
saw
it
would
be
fine
with
the
shelf
life
d
drinkable
but
i
cant
session
dopplebocks
but
for
what
it
is
great
had
this
one
at
the
moan
and
dove
in
amherst
mass
on
tap
poured
a
dark
brown
coloe
with
a
half
ince
white
heading
smell
was
very
nutty
with
notes
of
chocolate
and
nutmeg
in
the
mix
taste
was
overwhelmingly
filled
with
nut
and
chocolate
flavors
a
bit
of
caramel
in
there
too
a
lot
lighter
then
i
had
expected
pretty
medium
in
the
end
very
nice
as
far
as
drinkability
one
more
would
have
been
great
this
is
a
really
awesome
beer
still
deciding
whether
i
like
it
better
on
tap
or
from
the
bottle
also
seems
more
alelike
then
lagerish
guess
it
doesnt
matter
in
the
end
its
still
totally
worth
trying
the
ram
on
the
bottle
is
now
on
my
bunchy
of
keys
happy
trails
definitely
has
the
outstanding
tag
for
a
reason
highly
recommended
an
excellent
doppelbock
the
flavors
are
excellent
and
it
has
a
great
mouthfeel
highly
recommended
drinkability
this
is
a
very
filling
beer
i
imagine
it
has
to
do
with
the
high
levels
of
maltiness
carbonation
and
alcohol
good
but
not
a
session
beer
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
one
of
the
best
of
its
kind
this
is
my
first
taste
of
this
great
brew
and
will
definately
review
again
i
will
need
a
few
tastes
to
even
begin
to
comprehend
the
complex
flavors
in
this
beer
d
this
is
simply
an
incredible
beer
and
renowned
for
very
good
reasons
the
goat
ornament
will
soon
be
joined
by
many
more
without
a
doubt
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
this
might
be
my
new
favorite
beer
too
bad
its
so
pricey
the
mouth
is
fullbodied
and
quite
complex
going
from
lighter
to
toaster
then
syrupy
notes
its
quite
a
mouthful
it
is
also
well
rounded
making
for
a
high
drinkability
the
beer
is
worth
the
pricethe
gimmicky
plastic
goat
is
just
a
bonus
bottom
line
celebrator
is
an
exceptional
beer
tops
the
night
off
as
good
as
any
this
is
a
truly
amazing
beer
extremely
savory
and
insanely
drinkable
you
will
never
find
a
better
dopplebock
nor
will
you
find
many
better
beers
period

oh
im
celabratin

goddam
awesome
im
reinvigorated

a
very
good
offering
nonetheless

i
got
a
doppelbock
sweet
and
smooth
milk
chocolate
malts
all
over
the
place
rich
medium
bodied
and
milky
in
texture
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
like
the
supermalty
smooth
character
of
this
one
defnintley
the
best
dopplebock
ive
had
so
far
although
i
really
havent
had
that
many
i
do
like
the
style
and
will
seek
out
others
d
very
drinkable

a
sweet
finish
could
drink
quite
a
few
more
of
these
a
great
beer
definitely
a
must
try
for
you

definitely
buy

was
caramel
and
molasses
dark

bread
roasted

no
hops
came
out
in
the
aroma
and
there
was
a
faint
scent
of
alcohol
taste
was
sweet
almost
portlike
but
not
as
strong
in
the
graperaisin
flavor
dark
cherry
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
and
a
coffee
flavor
kept
the
overall
sweetness
in
balance
hops
still
awol
body
was
medium
plus
carbonation
was
medium
and
led
to
a
pleasantly
creamy
brew
alcohol
warming
kicks
in
about
14
of
the
way
through
the
beer
this
was
quite
good
and
much
sweeter
than
i
remember
it
from
a
year
ago
but
with
enough
bitterness
to
balance
a
lager
barleywine
overall
its
not
knocking
my
socks
off
which
makes
me
really
want
to
try
this
beer
on
draft
to
really
see
what
it
can
do
for
me
i
had
the
privilege
of
having
this
lovely
brew
on
tap
after
the
wonderful
tour
at
the
ayinger
brewery
it
pours
a
luscious
looking
dark
brownreddish
color
with
a
lovely
head
that
dissipates
and
doesnt
lace
it
has
smells
and
tastes
of
chocolate
coffee
toffee
molasses
roasted
barley
figs
dates
and
roasted
nuts
it
has
a
heavy
mouthfeel
which
is
kind
of
sryupy
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
it
is
kind
of
heavy
so
i
wouldnt
want
to
many
of
these
in
a
session
overall
this
beer
is
gorgeous
and
i
will
buy
it
again
and
again
this
pours
a
clear
dark
mahogony
with
a
medium
tan
foamy
head
the
smell
is
a
smoked
wood
with
dark
fruitnot
too
strongbut
ok
the
tastelike
the

sweet

maybe
carmel
the
mf
is
medium
with
a
nice
creamy
feel
all
the
flavors
mix
very
very
well
an
incredible
beer
well
worth
all
the
acolades
given
to
it
its
a
pretty
decent
looking
very
dark
brown
doppelbock
with
a
good
centimeter
of
creamy
head
when
poured
from
the
bottle
but
it
dissipates
to
about
half
that
over
a
couple
minutes
lacing
is
pretty
good
almost
leaving
thin
sheets
of
foam
down
the
side
the
nose
isnt
particularly
special
just
malt
and
hops
no
discernable
alcohol
aroma
the
flavor
isnt
anything
special
either
its
pretty
much
what
youd
expect
from
the
nose
malt
hops
bread
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
thicker
than
many
beers
without
being
syrupy
the
glowing
reviews
surprise
me
as
ive
found
this
to
be
a
rather
average
beer
there
are
other
doppelbocks
that
are
considerably
better
than
this
one
not
a
bad
beer
this
one
seemed
to
have
more
hops
and
a
little
less
malt
compared
to
other
doppelbocks
try
this
one
overall
an
excellent
beer
honestly
i
remember
it
being
a
bit
better
but
still
a
fine
beer
one
of
the
best
doppebocks
ive
had
the
best
beer
i
have
reviewed
to
date
i
love
this
drinkablility
is
pretty
good
i
could
have
another
right
now
probably
dont
know
if
it
will
make
a
regular
appearance
in
my
stock
but
i
will
probably
purchase
this
again
a
pretty
good
doppel
easy
to
drink
will
have
again
drinkability
this
is
by
far
the
best
dopplebock
ive
had
so
far
very
tasty
and
complex
much
intense
flavor
yet
not
at
all
overpowering
in
any
way
almost
completely
black
body
with
about
a
half
inch
tan
head
smells
mostly
sweet
with
chocolate
caramel
and
just
a
hint
of
hop
tastes
chocolate
with
some
sourness
to
it
nice
and
roasty
excellent
similar
to
sam
adams
chocolate
bock
only
better
and
cheeper
at
least
to
try
theres
a
distinct
possibility
id
get
this
again
its
very
good
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
no
doubt
about
it
now
to
decide
what
to
do
with
the
white
goat
thing
that
came
with
it
very
drinkable
but
filling
up
to
about
four
then
be
sure
you
have
your
designated
driver

if

like

drinkability
is
good
quite
drinkable
lovely
relaxing
sipper
creamy
thick

could
drink
till
im
on
my
ass
a
true
dark
brown
color
with
lively
ruby
tones
in
the
light
with
a
full
one
finger
creamy
and
not
bubly
almondcolored
head
this
looks
great
in
an
oversized
pilsner
glass
aroma
is
mild
and
delicious
definitely
german
but
not
stale
and
musty
smelling
as
sometimes
is
the
casemore
malt
aromas
than
hops
but
also
not
that
ultra
sweet
syrupy
aroma
more
of
a
husky
sweet
chocolate
malt
aroma
in
the
forefront
with
a
bit
of
peat
smoked
malt
taste
is
delicious
light
but
also
dark
and
so
a
bit
hifi
again
like
some
schwarzbiers
though
less
so
than
others
ive
tasted
of
late
with
some
midrange
sweet
malt
to
balance
definitely
a
touch
of
peat
smoke
with
some
drying
cocoa
flavors
from
dark
malts
unique
flavor
among
dopplebocks
more
complex
definitely
a
lager
but
that
comes
with
the
benefit
of
the
enhanced
smoothness
factor
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
full
and
the
weight
on
the
tounge
is
retained
even
after
some
decarbonation
which
leaves
many
a
beer
watery
and
bland
behind
the
veil
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
among
the
great
beers
best
of
style
from
germany
i
prefer
thomas
hookers
version
admitedly
but
this
is
the
only
other
one
id
return
to
and
its
a
worthy
beer
for
special
occasions
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
was
disappointed
the
second
time
i
felt
sure
that
this
one
was
way
overhyped
this
is
the
third
bottle
ive
had
and
i
think
im
starting
to
see
what
people
are
raving
about
a
beer
for
me
and
a
toy
for
the
grandson
a
world
class
doppelbock
celebrator
is
one
the
worlds
best
doppelbocks
smooth
clean
and
tastes
great
this
is
my
favorite
doppelbock
thus
far
oelergud
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
somewhat
dry
for
this
style
but
very
full
nicely
balanced
and
perfectly
carbonated
very
tasty
stuff
one
is
never
enough
note
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
take
the
goat
off
the
bottle
before
pouring
or
you
may
find
yourself
fishing
it
out
of
the
glass
i
think
this
beer
would
make
an
excelent
session
beer
it
is
only
slightly
high
in
alcohol
the
flavor
is
wonderful
and
would
probably
never
get
old
this
is
definately
a
world
class
beer
d
this
is
a
beer
where
i
wish
i
bought
more
than
one
if
you
see
it
get
an
extra
for
the
cellar
i
purposely
saved
the
celebrator
until
after
i
had
rated
at
least
100
beers
and
was
not
disappointed
at
having
waited
poured
to
a
jet
black
with
thick
tan
head
and
very
good
lacing
sweet
strog
aroma
of
malt
and
dark
fruits
mostly
grapes
plums
and
cheries
flavor
of
choclate
and
dark
fruit
at
midglass
the
alcohol
became
more
evident
but
blended
in
nicely
with
the
other
flavors
just
a
little
too
sweet
or
i
would
have
rated
even
higher
as
it
had
a
very
good
finish
pours
a
mostly
opaque
black
with
slight
ruby
highlights
a
minimal
amount
of
head
appears
but
is
gone
quickly
tracing
is
ok
aromas
of
raisins
sherry
slight
oxidation
and
roasted
malts
flavor
is
mostly
roasty
malts
slight
chocolatiness
very
clean
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
hops
are
mostly
floral
and
slightly
spicy
but
just
enough
bitterness
to
contrast
the
sweetness
quite
balanced
carbonation
is
low
but
provides
a
slight
creaminess
alcohol
is
barely
detected
but
at
the
level
it
shouldnt
be
overall
i
was
expecting
more
from
a
top
rated
beer
but
this
one
is
lacking
complexity
due
to
low
gravity
perhaps
if
it
werent
so
richfilling
after
a
while
and
not
inexpensive
i
would
want
to
continue
drinking
these
its
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
heaven
in
a
bottle
exceptionally
smooth
and
delicious
sweet
giant
head
with
fat
bubbles
is
about
2
inches
thick
color
is
a
deep
tan
body
is
jet
letting
me
light
thru
smokey
rich
malt
is
quite
vigorous
on
the
nose
almost
meaty
in
smell
as
it
enters
the
mouth
you
get
dark
coffee
notes
smokey
malt
is
the
second
wave
but
light
and
slightly
watered
down
deep
rithness
is
long
on
the
mouthfeel
and
though
the
finish
there
may
even
be
a
hint
of
dark
ripe
fruit
very
easy
drinking
for
fans
of
dark
decently
malty
beers
nice
midrange
alchol
also
md
medium
bodied
light
carbonation
easy
to
drink
i
feel
that
this
beer
might
be
a
good
one
to
introduce
new
beer
drinkers
to
complex
beers
its
pretty
wonderful
two
11
2
ozers
wasnt
enough
to
quench
my
increasing
dbock
urge
but
with
a
hefty
price
tag
two
ended
up
being
plenty
great
beer
d
highly
recommended
a
bit
rich
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
but
otherwise
outstanding
thank
you
ayinger
this
is
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
large
tanned
foam
head
the
color
is
a
dark
amber
almost
nontransparent
the
aroma
is
toffee
chocolate
bready
yeast
and
just
plain
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
of
toffee
chocolate
big
malt
backbone
slight
alcohol
mixed
with
a
little
fruitness
the
body
is
medium
and
smooth
the
smooth
and
creamy
texture
of
the
body
is
velvety
i
would
say
that
more
than
two
in
one
sitting
is
a
my
fill
imo
the
best
dopplebock
i
have
had
to
this
date
drinkability
is
very
good
for
all
its
thickness
and
richness
i
want
more
than
the
one
i
bought
d
delightful
beer
im
almost
disappointed
i
didnt
have
it
in
the
comfort
of
my
home
with
a
few
friends
and
a
warm
winter
fire
but
there
will
be
time
for
that
i
will
have
to
say
however
that
as
with
any
very
malty
beer
and
any
extremely
flavorful
beer
this
is
one
to
be
enjoyed
in
moderation
i
cant
see
anyone
throwing
back
a
six
of
this
in
one
sitting
but
the
23
you
may
have
will
be
quite
fine
finish
is
very
coffee
like
to
me
bravo
filled
the
glass
with
a
murky
amber
body
tiny
tan
head
settles
on
top
nose
leaps
out
bready
rummy
syrupy
all
at
once
taste
is
rum
strawberry
syrup
theres
a
hint
of
choclate
and
pine
in
the
finish
mouth
is
rich
and
creamy
highly
drinkable
a
good
beer
overall
but
not
worthy
of
the
hype
pours
a
three
finger
light
brown
head
that
fades
quickly
no

almost
black
color
light
carbonation

heavy
bodied

this
beer
pours
a
deep
copper
brown
with
w
creamy
white
head
that
leaves
thick
foam
all
the
way
down
the
glass
but
without
a
lot
of
lace
the
smell
is
roasted
sweet
malts
not
chocolate
and
not
particularily
coffee
like
either
there
is
somewhat
of
a
caramel
aroma
the
taste
is
fantastic
very
sweet
of
course
roasted
caramel
flavors
and
maybe
some
toffee
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
bold
quite
good
overall
very
drinkable
a
great
dopplebock
my
first
live
review
drinking
and
typing
no
notes
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
hotel
water
glass
it
had
a
small
tan
and
patchy
brown
head
on
top
of
a
cola
like
body
the
smell
was
immediately
smokey
with
hints
of
roasted
coffee
and
then
it
went
sweet
like
molasses
the
taste
started
out
with
some
caramel
and
then
the
roasted
coffee
kicked
in
then
there
was
a
bit
of
pepper
like
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
was
amazing
the
exact
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
chewyness
donly
one
more
for
meits
thick
and
so
flavorful
that
one
does
the
job
ill
have
it
again
but
its
one
to
sip
and
enjoy
d
one
of
the
world
classics
get
it
whenever
you
can
tip
this
goes
well
in
a
tulip
actually
i
prefer
a
tulip
because
of
the
concentration
of
the
smell
at
the
mouth
of
the
glass
a
great
buy
if
you
come
across
it
which
is
not
a
difficult
task
served
in
a
mug
the
celebrator
pours
dark
brown
with
some
tinges
of
red
theres
about
an
inch
tan
carbonated
head
which
doesnt
stay
around
for
too
long
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
molasses
and
a
little
bit
of
chcocolate
a
very
nice
aroma
it
tastes
like
roasted
malt
toffee
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
mild
bitter
aftertaste
mediumbodied
and
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
an
easily
drinkable
dopplebock
with
a
good
mixture
of
sweet
and
bitter
celebrator
is
a
well
balanced
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
its
a
very
good
beer
one
of
the
best
that
ive
had
the
little
plastic
goat
that
comes
with
the
beer
is
an
added
bonus
cheers
that
said
the
sweetness
of
this
fine
beer
lends
itself
to
modest
quantities
i
would
personally
find
a
large
quantity
a
little
stomachturning
very
dark
brown
with
brilliant
ruby
highlights
the
light
tan
foam
poured
a
little
short
but
quite
dense
and
produced
decent
lacing
heavy
malt
aroma
with
some
molasses
and
a
hint
of
cocoa
fruity
notes
of
raisins
and
prunes
light
charcoal
smokiness
came
out
as
it
warmed
as
well
bitterness
was
on
the
low
side
balance
was
very
much
towards
malt
sweet
dried
fruit
and
rich
malt
not
quite
caramel
but
definitely
caramelized
sugar
smoke
character
and
light
metallic
iron
lingers
in
the
finish
mediumfull
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
delicate
alcohol
warmth
creamy
texture
with
a
bit
of
grain
dryness
great
complexity
yet
still
highly
drinkable
definitely
a
world
class
dopplebock
d
pretty
good
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
and
the
abv
is
somewhat
low
for
a
doppelbock
the
taste
is
the
exceptional
rich
roasted
malts
melding
into
a
chocolaty
coffee
finish
i
have
not
had
a
better
beer
so
smooth
going
down
with
a
nice
lingering
finish
from
the
moment
i
opened
the
bottle
and
got
a
whiff
of
the
aroma
until
i
put
the
empty
glass
on
the
bar
after
my
second
one
the
experience
was
thoroughly
enjoyable
drinkability
this
is
a
great
beer
so
flavorful
so
drinkable
complex
and
tasty
it
would
be
good
with
a
number
of
things
sweeter
items
but
also
other
bold
flavors
to
contrast
notes
so
smooth
so
balanced
so
rich
and
so
tasty
i
will
never
be
without
a
few
bottles
of
this
hanging
around
is
this
celebrator
double
bock
drinkable
um
yes
this
is
as
its
bottle
states
the
finest
bavarian
double
bock
bavarian
or
otherwise
for
that
matter
in
my
opinion
at
least
at
this
point
balanced
tasty
and
damned
impressive
its
easy
to
see
why
this
beer
is
in
the
top
100
and
easy
to
see
whay
it
is
the
basic
epitome
of
the
dopplebock
superbly
rich
and
sweet
right
in
line
with
what
i
want
when
i
think
dopplebock
a
great
beer
complex
rich
and
dark
thats
what
a
doppelbock
is
all
about
isnt
it
deliciously
well
crafted
and
incredibly
satisfying
another
inhaleable
beer
thanks
to
its
awesome
smell
and
taste
this
would
go
great
with
a
buttery
creamy
chocolatey
dessert
personally
i
find
this
about
as
good
as
youre
going
to
find
for
this
style
of
beer
this
works
in
the
whole
meal
unto
itself
classification
smooth
maltiness
with
a
rich
mouthfeel
rounds
out
this
outstanding
brew
fullbodied
and
roasty
this
is
as
drinkable
as
a
beer
gets
imo
im
not
going
to
jump
up
and
down
about
the
appearance
and
smell
neither
aspect
does
a
whole
lot
for
me
where
it
matters
for
me
is
the
taste
and
drinkability
both
of
which
are
perfect
for
this
outstanding
this
brew
pours
an
opaque
black
color
the
head
is
large
offwhite
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
toffee
cream
butter
and
caramel
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
good
but
not
rather
faint
even
at
the
correct
serving
temperature
the
mouthfeel
on
the
other
hand
is
wonderful
creamy
smooth
fullbodied
with
moderate
yet
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
doppelbock
but
i
would
choose
andechser
over
it
anyday
hands
down
crux
tremendous
dopplebock
highly
recommended
note
excellent
with
saurbraten
the
semisweetness
of
the
beer
truly
compliments
the
semiacidity
of
the
brined
beef
a
german
treasure
a
hardcore
yet
beautiful
specimen
d
good
but
not
great
it
is
too
strong
to
session
and
would
work
with
foods
but
i
dont
know
how
soon
i
will
have
it
again
it
is
a
nice
beer
for
sure
but
it
isnt
something
i
see
myself
seeking
out
again
soon
finally
after
what
seems
like
ages
the
renowned
doppelbock
becomes
available
in
alberta
thanks
to
delancey
direct
for
importing
it
into
the
local
market
comes
in
a
4pack
holder
telling
about
the
numerous
awards
and
a
little
piece
on
the
side
about
the
aying
brewery
330ml
bottles
the
beers
all
have
a
white
plastic
goatcharm
on
red
string
around
the
neck
cool
i
have
never
seen
that
before
simple
labelling
showing
two
goats
and
a
big
glass
of
beer
blue
and
white
neck
wrapping
too
popping
the
unlabeled
white
cap
gives
smoky
bbq
aromas
rigth
away
the
glass
reveals
a
coladark
beer
deep
chestnut
brown
and
rubyreds
when
held
to
light
black
to
look
at
it
from
a
distance
a
thin
but
consistent
coffeecoloured
head
impermeable
sheets
of
slowmoving
lace
looks
mighty
drinkable
sitting
there
in
the
glass
but
first
a
sniff
revealing
charcoal
and
seasoning
salt
firstly
oh
but
give
the
glass
a
slight
swirl
to
release
some
beautiful
notes
of
raisins
roasted
peanuts
toast
grapejuice
and
some
very
woody
notes
like
balsam
or
fir
a
hint
of
the
woodiness
i
am
used
to
in
some
belgian
dubbels
but
with
more
salinity
all
the
usual
darkfruit
suspects
dates
prunes
and
plums
the
mochacoffee
notes
arirve
with
the
warming
of
the
beer
adding
a
dusty
bitterness
i
get
loads
of
salt
in
this
beer
from
the
roasted
malts
giving
beef
roast
and
beef
jerky
smells
some
lactose
in
the
malting
too
very
minimal
little
bits
of
german
hopping
appear
now
and
again
but
this
is
all
about
the
meatlike
grains
for
sure
for
me
it
is
similar
to
salvator
but
more
balanced
not
quite
as
dusty
or
sour
as
paulaners
doppelbock
subtle
but
extremely
appetising
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
creamy
and
light
on
the
tongue
like
icecream
as
soon
as
you
sip
you
sense
the
almost
airy
quality
of
the
body
smooth
as
oil
on
the
tongue
salty
and
sourish
malting
at
first
in
the
mouth
with
full
vinous
grains
on
the
finish
a
lot
of
milkiness
up
front
actually
with
the
soft
sourness
of
tablecream
hickory
and
treebark
on
the
middle
some
bbq
and
roast
beef
as
well
a
little
less
smoky
or
even
malty
as
i
expected
the
whole
taste
just
screams
balance
and
tastiness
an
aftertaste
of
mollasses
and
maple
syrup
with
next
to
no
bitterness
this
beer
ends
extremely
sweet
candy
sweet
with
hints
of
licorice
and
brown
sugar
the
malting
rarely
lets
you
see
the
hops
but
occasionally
a
little
burst
of
continental
hopping
appears
like
the
aroma
this
beer
just
works
through
subtlety
and
good
elements
balanced
masterfully
full
bodied
and
very
low
in
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
profound
at
only
6
7
the
alcohol
is
never
noticeable
this
is
a
doppelbock
i
could
drink
all
night
long
a
noteworthy
example
of
the
style
not
trying
to
go
overthetop
just
succeeding
in
a
finetasting
bock
beer
i
think
that
is
where
its
beauty
lies
simply
flavourful
this
one
is
right
up
my
alley
i
had
high
expectations
and
they
were
met
i
encourage
all
beer
lovers
to
indulge
in
this
one
d
very
filling
with
loads
of
residual
sugars
a
pleasure
d
high
moderate
abv
sweet
smooth
no
bite
even
a
macro
drinker
should
be
able
to
pound
this
drinkability
i
would
have
to
say
this
was
impressive
i
could
drink
this
for
a
importedmildly
expnsive
session
beer
alcohol
is
undetectable
however
very
present
6
7
abv
mouthfeel
is
heavy
to
mediumheavy
with
a
carbonation
level
thats
very
light
compared
to
the
bodys
heaviness
yet
i
wouldnt
change
a
thing
it
moves
the
beer
and
flavors
enough
around
on
the
palate
to
be
noticeable
but
lets
the
beer
be
quite
alone
when
it
needs
to
be
and
allow
its
full
complexity
to
develop
on
the
tastebuds
drinkability
is
fantastic
as
this
is
a
thick
rich
beer
one
usually
only
takes
slow
sips
of
it
the
6
7
alcohol
levels
nearly
guarantees
that
theres
no
effect
from
one
of
these
having
one
or
more
is
thus
quite
possible
on
a
cold
fallwinterspringss
day
looks
like
ive
found
another
brew
that
will
probably
always
need
to
be
onhand
in
my
refrigerator
d
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
im
lucky
that
these
are
easily
available
in
my
area
i
will
try
and
keep
these
on
hand
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
these
at
once
but
one
every
once
in
a
while
is
perfect
a
very
nice
beer
here
chocolatey
malts
with
a
little
hop
kickback
true
to
style
some
mocha
caramel
going
on
here
i
felt
the
body
was
a
little
thin
but
that
way
it
oh
and
slightly
overpriced
but
a
fine
recommended
beer
and
a
very
good
brewery
in
ayinger
a
little
head
disappated
quickly
and
left
a
little
lacing
smell
nothing
great
except
a
few
fruit
esthers
but
an
overall
good
brew
all
in
all
quite
an
accomplishment
from
a
brewery
with
barely
a
hundred
years
of
experience
i
purchased
a
case
to
age
and
will
do
follow
up
reviews
as
it
does
over
the
next
several
years
mk
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
straight
up
first
of
all
it
comes
in
an
awesome
bottle
and
pours
a
dark
brown
it
had
a
rich
and
bold
roasted
malt
aroma
with
a
hint
of
caramel
to
it
and
a
medium
hop
bitterness
the
taste
was
wellbalanced
and
flavorful
without
allowing
the
higher
amount
of
alcohol
to
make
it
taste
boozy
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumthick
with
medium
carbonation
i
felt
that
this
beer
was
quite
drinkable
simply
because
of
its
high
quality
and
excellent
taste
my
only
lament
is
that
im
a
college
student
and
cant
afford
to
drink
these
on
a
regular
basis
highly
recommended
drinkability
this
is
very
good
beer
i
could
drink
several
in
any
one
sitting
abv
of
6
7
may
intimidate
some
into
just
one
or
two
but
not
me
also
alcohol
is
totally
not
present
in
taste
at
all
so
that
should
be
something
to
be
mindful
of
if
youre
driving
but
if
not
well
bottums
up
most
certainly
an
enjoyable
doppelbock
it
definitely
has
produced
its
own
niche
for
its
take
on
the
style
and
a
worthy
following
although
i
liked
it
i
couldnt
see
myself
buying
this
on
a
regular
basis
though
perhaps
saving
it
more
for
special
occassions
and
to
introduce
friends
to
this
unique
ale
one
at
at
time
is
enough
to
satiate
me
im
not
craving
a
followup
at
the
moment
drinkability
is
great
i
never
get
tired
of
the
flavor
and
at
6
7
you
can
drink
more
than
a
few
without
being
overwelmed
definitely
the
best
doppelbock
ive
had
so
far
poured
basically
black
with
a
slightly
brownamber
tint
and
a
tancream
head
somewhat
roasty
aroma
and
a
smell
that
was
very
much
like
molasses
and
a
taste
to
match
molasses
was
definitely
the
dominant
flavor
with
some
hints
of
vanilla
here
and
there
too
and
very
malty
definitely
worth
the
3
bucks
for
only
a
12
oz
bottle
pours
dark
brownblack
with
reddish
tint
thick
creamy
tan
head
that
recedes
to
light
cover
nice
lacing
aroma
is
dark
fruit
molases
toffee
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
cookie
dough
flavor
is
malty
and
fruity
delight
plums
raisins
molases
bitter
chocolate
a
touch
of
hops
some
roastedness
comes
at
the
end
finish
is
longish
and
dry
with
a
bit
of
warming
alcohol
texture
is
smooth
and
creamy
very
nice
notes
this
isnt
something
id
order
with
a
big
spicy
steak
or
any
meal
thats
too
powerful
it
would
make
a
great
after
dinner
beer
though
you
have
to
be
ready
for
a
cloying
rich
sweet
desert
before
drinking
this
otherwise
it
will
be
wasted
in
short
this
is
an
excellent
beer
im
not
really
a
big
bock
fan
but
perhaps
this
is
the
finest
bock
in
the
world
it
gets
my
vote
drinkability
give
me
another
one
now
its
that
good
i
only
have
one
and
im
sad
ive
heard
this
beer
is
considered
to
be
the
epitome
of
the
dopplebock
style
while
i
do
like
it
very
much
i
can
think
of
others
that
i
think
are
even
better
pours
a
dark
rubychestnut
color
with
excellent
clarity
a
dark
tan
head
will
fill
the
glass
then
become
comfortable
at
three
fingers
leaves
sticky
spots
of
lace
the
nose
is
pretty
clean
toasted
amber
and
crystal
malt
with
a
slight
ester
aroma
taste
begins
sweet
with
roasted
crystal
malt
background
nutty
flavor
and
a
hint
of
fruity
esterplum
aftertaste
is
residual
with
only
a
hint
of
drying
noble
hop
i
felt
was
a
bit
shy
even
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
low
carbonation
and
a
syrupy
body
the
finish
is
appropriatly
residual
sweet
but
the
ester
is
subdued
and
allows
an
excellent
drinkability
pours
a
deep
mahogony
brown
with
a
good
2
finger
head
great
longevity
and
equally
great
lace
outstanding
roasted
malt
aromas
hints
of
coffee
and
vanilla
huge
chewy
malt
flavors
earthy
bits
of
dark
caramel
and
coffee
thick
and
syrupy
and
smooth
as
any
i
have
ever
tasted
the
mother
of
all
dobbelbocks
i
dont
give
out
5s
as
no
beer
is
perfect
imho
but
this
is
as
close
as
you
can
get
with
this
style
a
beautiful
beer
overall
this
is
a
kickass
beer
a
beautiful
bock
in
a
beautiful
bottle
love
the
little
goat
strongly
recommended
a
good
complexity
of
malt
but
some
lingering
yeast
qualities
and
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
full
flavor
full
bodied
end
it
ator
and
you
wont
go
wrong
this
is
a
tasty
brew
i
found
that
i
enjoyed
it
more
as
it
warmed
the
flavors
seem
to
blend
and
add
comlexity
to
the
massive
malt
attack
the
beer
poured
a
very
deep
mahogany
with
a
finger
of
thick
surprisingly
fizzy
sounding
head
the
nose
blew
me
away
with
an
enormous
doughy
presence
with
dark
and
subdued
fruit
undertones
and
a
small
hint
of
carmel
the
flavor
provided
the
expected
big
malts
with
a
wonderful
molasses
presence
a
medium
body
and
excellent
warming
beer
there
exists
a
hint
of
smokiness
to
celebrator
as
well
very
subdued
but
there
the
alcohol
although
not
overly
high
or
necessarily
high
for
the
style
hides
behind
the
enormous
flavor
of
this
brew
this
is
one
that
although
ive
had
difficulty
finding
it
in
the
area
i
would
return
to
before
the
others
of
this
particular
style
that
ive
encountered
ive
reviewed
this
before
but
not
ontap
in
germany
brought
to
me
from
georgia
by
dirtylou
cellared
since
then
july
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
chewy
and
full
a
thickness
coats
your
tongue
and
the
flavor
linger
for
quite
a
long
time
since
it
hides
its
alcohol
well
much
better
than
other
dopplebocks
i
feel
the
drinkability
is
quite
high
very
well
done
the
balance
of
the
flavors
alone
is
enough
to
make
this
one
a
real
treat
plenty
of
flavor
complex
and
balanced
this
is
a
true
doppelbock
from
which
this
style
originated
its
more
like
a
meal
than
just
a
drink
330
ml
bottle
celebrator
pours
out
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
huge
dense
head
intricate
layers
of
lacing
are
left
on
my
glass
as
i
drink
the
aroma
is
caramel
chocolate
and
nuts
big
bready
malt
flavor
some
caramel
and
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
there
is
also
a
nutty
flavor
that
i
cant
get
enough
of
finishes
with
subtle
spicy
hops
perfectly
balanced
and
quite
complex
mouthfeel
is
so
smooth
i
cant
detect
any
alcohol
this
is
a
classic
world
class
dopplebock
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
what
a
nice
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
thick
and
tanish
head
there
is
a
distinct
sweetmalty
flavor
running
through
this
beer
very
pleasing
to
the
nose
and
eyes
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
goodness
with
a
bit
of
spice
and
fruity
to
balance
things
out
and
make
this
one
enjoyable
beer
the
body
is
medium
to
heavy
but
i
find
this
beer
very
drinkable
taste
just
as
the
aroma
implies
nice
and
malty
theres
some
coffee
a
light
presence
of
anise
with
a
little
chocolate
with
hints
of
caramel
and
a
just
touch
of
some
hop
bitterness
im
more
of
a
hop
head
but
when
im
in
the
mood
for
malts
this
is
a
great
one
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
and
very
easy
to
drink
ruby
seriously
stunning
aroma
of
figs
grapes
caramel
and
chocolate
just
a
deep
and
malty
aroma
characterful
and
complex
malty
flavor
with
notes
of
figs
fruits
caramel
and
chocolate
very
sweet
flavor
subtle
hopping
silky
and
coating
feel
on
the
palate
a
very
nice
beer
d
id
certainly
pick
it
up
again
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
you
can
drink
moderately
quickly
if
you
want
but
is
more
enjoyable
if
sipped
the
flavors
became
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
warmed
so
letting
the
bottle
sit
out
for
a
few
minutes
before
you
drink
it
might
be
a
good
idea
if
you
can
stand
looking
at
the
beautiful
bottle
jesus
h
christ
i
love
this
stuff
im
not
sure
how
well
i
can
really
describe
how
much
i
love
this
stuff
but
here
we
go
pours
extremly
dark
brown
almost
like
a
porter
smells
a
bit
malt
syrupy
but
good
taste
is
wow
malt
cocoa
some
mild
dried
fruit
slightly
bitter
but
again
of
cocoa
mouthfeel
is
nice
drinkability
is
excellent
though
you
want
to
sip
on
this
i
can
go
for
more
again
and
again
the
best
i
have
had
so
far
mouthfeel
is
medium
though
not
cloying
and
smooth
as
silk
dessert
in
a
glass
awesome
not
usually
much
a
bock
fan
but
saw
this
heard
good
things
and
had
to
try
it
very
glad
i
did
there
will
be
more
of
these
in
my
future
a
heavier
mouthfeel
than
the
first
i
had
tried
taste
and
aroma
were
still
that
of
malty
cocoa
both
were
still
wonderful
just
not
as
drinkable
as
my
initial
tasting
drinkability
this
beer
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
the
beer
is
dam
near
perfect
i
suspect
i
may
have
had
a
religious
experience
drinking
this
beer
i
finally
got
to
tap
a
30
liter
keg
of
celebrator
and
i
couldnt
wait
to
christen
the
barrel
by
enjoying
the
first
glass
a
rich
deep
brown
when
poured
into
my
glass
decent
head
tan
in
color
the
aroma
is
inviting
malty
and
sweet
the
flavor
as
usual
with
this
beer
is
phenomenal
big
mouth
sweet
and
malty
with
a
nice
roasted
balance
i
love
this
in
the
bottle
but
on
tap
man
im
obsessed
with
it
if
it
wasnt
almost
7
abv
i
would
drink
it
alnight
avery
night
all
winter
long
this
is
pure
malty
goodness
if
you
like
this
in
the
bottle
seek
it
out
on
tap
and
you
wont
be
dissappointed
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
with
an
nice
looking
brown
head
aroma
is
matly
with
sweet
and
roasted
malt
some
fruity
raisin
some
chocolate
as
well
as
some
alchohol
mediumfull
body
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
carbonation
hide
the
alchohol
flavor
nicely
taste
is
roasted
grain
and
sweet
matlyness
but
it
all
goes
together
very
smooth
best
boublebock
i
ever
had
this
is
a
sipper
of
a
beer
sit
back
relax
enjoy
its
deep
maltiness
overall
a
nice
smooth
and
flavorful
beer
a
great
sipping
1
i
recommend
this
1
during
the
colder
winter
months
the
taste
is
worth
celebrating
this
beer
delivers
full
body
and
nice
clean
finish
with
a
slight
bitterness
by
no
means
sweet
more
of
a
roasty
flavor
the
taste
is
an
easy
5
i
am
betting
i
wont
soon
forget
it
totally
deserving
of
its
spot
in
the
best
of
ba
overall
an
exceptional
beer
one
of
the
best
of
its
kind
extremely
recommended
overall
ill
be
the
first
to
admit
that
i
dont
care
for
doppelbocks
much
but
ive
tried
to
give
as
impartial
and
unbiased
a
review
as
i
can
frankly
i
find
the
style
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
if
i
were
to
drink
one
this
would
top
the
list
of
those
i
have
tried
very
complex
flavor
and
unquestionably
a
fine
brew
d
this
is
the
first
doppelbock
that
ive
had
where
i
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
all
the
others
ive
had
were
to
malty
and
sweet
a
very
nice
beer
to
mix
up
my
routine
of
hoplaced
brews
im
glad
i
picked
this
up
i
went
out
and
purchased
a
4
pack
from
the
local
beverage
barn
planned
on
drinking
quietly
at
my
house
from
a
glass
i
ended
up
going
to
a
frat
house
party
and
drinking
it
out
of
the
bottle
i
must
say
it
has
a
potent
smell
and
syrupy
mouthfeel
i
was
feeling
my
stomach
ache
after
the
3rd
bottle
i
did
drink
them
quite
fast
tastes
of
dark
fruits
and
molasses
very
sticky
i
was
licking
it
off
my
lips
for
20
minutes
i
enjoyed
a
pear
cider
afterwords
and
the
two
mixing
tasted
like
peanut
butter
excellent
dopplebock
in
an
excellent
german
beer
bar
let
it
warm
a
little
it
is
soo
much
better
warm
highly
reccomended
so
happy
that
this
fared
this
well
despite
a
long
journey
from
bayern
the
little
goat
packs
a
flavor
punch
o
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
sampling
mmmmeaty
very
full
bodied
uniquely
warming
uber
dark
rubyorangebrown
with
an
impressively
huge
tan
head
great
retention
carmel
dark
chocolate
and
toasty
raisons
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
very
dark
but
very
drinkable
slight
dry
hop
finish
subtle
and
effective
a
great
treat
sessionable
aside
from
the
price
looks
like
winters
bane
robust
redbrown
darkness
with
a
fluffy
boiling
fudge
cream
head
the
smell
is
terrific
damn
near
like
boiling
wort
with
lots
of
over
done
sweetness
without
being
cloy
terrific
taste
if
only
dampened
by
the
slightly
thinish
body
while
the
body
makes
it
more
condusive
to
drinking
more
it
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
whatever
still
one
of
my
favs
anyday
and
i
will
have
some
just
about
everyday
until
the
keg
is
kicked
drinkability
above
average
i
could
definitely
drink
multiple
over
the
course
of
a
night
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
not
syrupy
very
smooth
eminently
satisfying
i
could
session
this
one
plus
a
kewl
goatee
hangtag
too
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
high
marks
all
around
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anybody
not
much
to
say
except
incredible
cheers
tasting
this
beverage
well
all
i
can
say
is
this
is
almost
like
drinking
pure
malt
its
like
id
want
to
pour
it
on
pancakes
the
raisin
taste
is
strong
the
dryness
of
the
hops
was
really
evident
and
the
winey
notes
define
what
a
quality
beer
this
is
worth
every
penny
drinkability
is
well
very
good
would
i
get
it
again
yep
but
like
gonzo
imperial
i
will
drink
these
on
special
occasions
notes
a
beauty
was
a
little
worried
because
of
the
hype
and
following
that
this
beer
has
that
it
wouldnt
live
up
i
love
being
proven
wrong
takes
a
deserving
spot
as
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
a
truly
great
experience
and
one
that
i
will
revisit
time
and
time
again
drinkability
highly
drinkable
strong
pleasing
flavor
not
filling
sensually
stimulating
warming
while
not
inhibiting
great
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
mediumsized
light
tan
frothy
slowly
diminishing
head
excellent
lacing
the
smell
is
quite
sweet
with
big
dark
malts
toffee
molasses
are
the
dominant
aromas
and
are
accompanied
by
a
grainy
cookielike
scent
some
light
yeast
and
some
light
herbal
hops
the
taste
is
oh
wow
this
is
good
follows
in
line
with
the
smell
with
the
dark
malts
stealing
the
show
caramel
and
molasses
take
center
stage
but
are
surrounded
by
a
supporting
cast
of
many
different
flavors
including
plum
raisin
licorice
cola
alcohol
and
bready
yeast
the
finish
is
dry
and
has
a
very
light
metallic
tinge
late
not
enough
to
really
detract
from
the
overall
quality
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderful
for
a
doppelbock
full
body
and
it
feels
thick
and
syrupy
in
the
mouth
but
goes
down
very
smoothly
now
granted
i
am
a
sucker
for
a
good
doppelbock
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
ones
ive
ever
had
definitely
the
best
bottled
one
for
sure
very
nicely
done
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
people
who
want
good
beer
should
reach
for
pours
with
an
amberhued
black
with
little
to
medium
head
smells
of
fruits
such
as
apple
and
figs
caramel
notes
are
also
present
taste
is
remarkable
aside
from
being
slightly
watery
the
bavarian
hops
really
shine
through
in
this
beer
the
alcohol
taste
is
present
but
not
too
obvious
very
smooth
and
drinkable
i
would
recommend
this
for
anyones
beer
night
an
excellent
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
poured
a
deep
brown
color
with
dark
reddish
highlights
head
was
tannish
puffy
and
lasted
forever
nice
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
taste
was
toasty
and
loaded
with
dark
fruits
raisins
dates
prunes
taste
was
absolutely
superb
with
with
the
nice
toasty
maltiness
predominating
and
the
dark
fruis
adding
a
subtle
sweetness
and
strong
background
fruitiness
very
complex
mixture
of
taste
finish
is
strong
and
is
the
perfect
ending
to
this
beer
easy
drinkability
that
hides
the
alcohol
content
extremely
well
outstanding
si
the
best
description
first
of
all
i
have
never
seen
a
beer
with
a
plastic
ram
hanging
from
the
neck
so
they
get
creativity
points
for
that
this
poured
a
gorgous
deep
brown
color
with
a
nice
creamy
looking
yet
fizzy
tean
head
the
aroma
is
smoky
and
sweet
quite
malty
wcocoa
hint
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
creamy
and
smooth
the
flavor
is
malty
as
hell
with
some
caramel
flavor
also
a
fruityness
sneaks
in
every
now
and
then
this
is
so
robust
and
rich
yet
the
drinkability
of
it
leads
me
to
conclude
that
this
brew
dominates
over
the
optimator
a
complex
flavor
which
is
not
so
complex
as
to
compromise
the
enjoyment
of
the
brew
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thick
and
the
smell
is
exceptional
the
appearance
is
fantastic
and
makes
me
want
to
dive
in
relatively
inexpensive
to
other
top
20
brews
this
one
is
highly
recommended
the
flavor
is
wonderfully
complex
theres
a
fantastic
slightlyburnt
quality
to
this
beer
rich
maple
syrup
tones
as
well
chewy
and
roasty
and
full
bodied
lovely
mocha
head
and
a
deep
dark
body
i
found
myself
craving
this
out
of
nowhere
in
the
middle
of
the
day
at
work
today
and
im
going
to
have
to
go
back
to
my
local
bar
for
more
this
was
a
tasty
brew
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
again
maybe
it
was
just
a
weird
night
because
i
am
sure
this
beer
deserves
all
the
praise
that
it
gets
an
extremely
smooth
beer
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
bangin
body
this
is
a
delight
had
this
as
a
dessertlike
cap
to
the
night
and
it
worked
perfectly
this
is
a
tasty
beer
that
i
will
probably
be
looking
for
more
of
and
introducing
friends
to
poured
an
almost
black
hue
with
deep
ruby
red
accents
in
the
light
voluminous
light
tan
head
with
considerable
persistence
and
healthy
lacing
in
the
celebrator
glassware
warm
inviting
and
sweet
aromas
spring
forth
with
a
decided
mollases
character
predominant
little
hop
assertion
and
dominated
by
the
sweet
malt
richness
of
brown
sugar
and
mollases
a
dryer
finish
than
expected
for
this
medium
to
heavy
body
with
little
carbonation
or
alcohol
detectable
despite
this
its
very
friendly
and
warm
beer
evoking
the
desire
to
share
it
with
friends
hence
the
name
i
suppose
doppelbock
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
certianly
a
supreme
exemplar
of
the
style
drinks
easily
and
invites
you
to
enjoy
more
a
lot
of
character
and
substance
which
almost
tricks
you
into
thinking
this
is
a
much
higher
abv
ale
excellent
representation
of
this
bavarian
standard
update
809
have
recently
delved
into
dark
beers
again
tried
the
korbinian
a
rival
of
celebrator
no
dopplebock
is
close
to
this
beer
celebrator
wins
while
i
have
many
more
beers
to
sample
i
have
no
hesitation
in
recognising
this
as
my
most
memorable
and
delightful
to
date
drinkability
drinkable
enough
i
guess
the
abv
is
not
overpowering
and
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
can
make
for
a
good
drink
this
brew
is
so
drinkable
it
is
incredible
it
hides
its
gravity
in
a
multi
layered
camouflage
of
complex
scents
and
tastes
this
is
an
awesome
brew
no
doubt
one
of
the
best
dopplebocks
i
have
ever
had
and
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
glad
i
have
3
more
of
these
bad
boys
drinkability
this
is
not
really
the
kind
of
beer
id
choose
to
celebrate
with
its
much
heavier
and
more
aggressive
than
its
moniker
would
suggest
this
beer
is
just
begging
for
some
grilled
sausages
or
venison
steaks
a
classic
and
the
bottle
came
with
a
cool
little
plastic
goat
that
you
can
play
with
nifty
mmm
tasty
ive
heard
goood
things
and
now
ive
tased
them
d
this
beer
has
a
very
smooth
soft
quality
to
the
grain
bill
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
soft
hop
note
the
flavor
has
just
enough
malt
complexity
to
leave
me
wanting
more
but
not
enough
to
make
me
satisfied
very
drinkable
i
would
definitely
like
another
very
enjoyable
tastey
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
beauty
this
was
probably
my
4th
different
dopplebock
that
ive
tried
the
color
of
the
beer
was
like
anyother
typical
dopplebock
nice
and
dark
but
not
too
dark
the
smell
man
gotta
love
the
smell
of
a
dopplebock
and
as
far
as
taste
it
was
so
far
the
best
dopplebock
ive
drank
i
would
recommend
trying
it
it
is
a
good
beer
to
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
with
a
good
meal
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
deceptive
and
coats
the
tongue
as
you
go
an
immensly
enjoyable
beer
that
is
worth
the
occasional
treat
a
must
try
for
sure
musings
this
is
one
brew
that
i
spluge
and
keep
around
every
winter
the
alcohol
content
is
not
as
high
as
some
other
dopples
but
the
taste
comes
across
like
a
monster
i
reviewed
this
after
the
sams
dopple
i
do
like
the
sams
however
it
is
not
on
the
same
planet
as
the
celebrator
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
you
will
ever
drink
i
dont
know
how
it
could
be
improved
this
is
an
awesome
beer
this
has
totally
turned
me
on
to
this
style
now
i
cant
wait
to
try
liberator
and
others
small

have
to

again
ontap

is
a
dark
ruby

with
a

very
nice
tasting
not
cloying
at
all
just
a
slight
note
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
medium
carbonatin
level
slightly
syrupy
this
is
a
really
nice
doppelbock
excellent
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
smooth
medium
bodied
and
rich
with
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
line
a
few
up
and
i
will
enjoy
every
drop
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
salvator
that
isnt
a
bad
thing
at
all
but
given
the
extremely
high
quality
of
ayingers
other
brews
i
expected
to
be
blown
away
rather
than
just
be
served
another
pretty
damn
good
brew
overall
not
a
bad
beer
ill
have
to
revisit
this
one
in
the
future
and
i
liked
the
little
goats
that
came
with
the
bottles
the
bloodhound
factor
if
there
were
more
than
12
oz
in
the
bottle
maybe
the
dogs
wouldve
got
to
taste
it
i
can
see
why
this
one
gets
so
much
praise
one
of
the
best
ive
had
and
one
i
will
go
to
on
any
given
occasion
absolutely
to
try
pours
an
inpenetrable
noir
with
a
tan
head
that
comes
down
quick
smell
is
just
heavenly
dark
chocolate
molasses
dates
spice
coffee
and
alcohol
what
a
smooth
smooth
beer
like
drinking
fresh
roasted
dark
coffee
with
an
alcohol
buzz
whats
really
unique
about
this
brew
is
its
low
6
7
abv
making
it
gleefully
drinkable
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
gave
this
a
decent
mouthfeel
quite
a
balanced
beer
overall
very
easy
to
drink
mild
bite
of
alcohol
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
that
should
be
a
standard
in
anyones
cellar
served
with
cheese
it
is
amazing
a
top
of
the
line
beer
from
a
top
of
the
line
brewery
this
is
an
exceptional
tasting
doppelbock
the
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
thick
with
a
sweet
caramel
twist
the
malt
presence
here
is
off
the
charts
hints
of
melted
caramel
and
juicy
prunes
so
smooth
and
drinkable
its
scary
this
beer
is
pure
quality
and
so
enjoyable
d
drinkability
is
great
not
decimating
for
a
dopplebock
and
keeps
you
wanting
the
next
sip
after
the
one
before
the
color
is
very
dark
but
you
can
detect
a
bit
of
amber
color
decent
head
retention
smells
of
fruit
and
vegetables
i
detected
sweet
corn
maybe
of
hint
of
raspberry
very
interesting
tastes
sugary
sweet
and
more
sweet
corn
flavor
medium
bodied
not
too
thick
very
unique
i
would
drink
it
again
if
paired
with
the
right
cuisine
pours
very
dark
has
a
tan
creamy
head
with
lacing
clinging
to
the
glass
for
dear
life
smell
is
very
malty
with
dark
fruits
in
there
as
well
taste
is
malty
as
one
would
espect
but
never
too
sweet
to
deter
you
from
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
pleasant
almost
chewy
very
drinkable
as
i
found
myself
reaching
for
another
great
to
have
with
a
nice
steak
poured
a
tint
which
is
on
the
border
of
black
but
is
actually
a
super
dark
reddishbrown
mahogany
head
stands
strong
lasting
forever
and
leaving
its
remnants
crusted
onto
the
side
of
the
glass
nose
was
damp
and
heavy
with
malty
notes
including
coffee
burnt
toast
chocolate
and
some
alcohol
taste
is
very
big
and
roasty
somewhat
like
a
light
porter
in
a
way
but
with
a
clean
bright
texture
which
sets
it
waaay
apart
from
an
average
beer
complex
flavors
unfold
as
the
beer
warms
and
come
to
include
suggestions
of
mocha
chewy
toffee
and
a
healthy
dose
of
alcohol
which
isnt
completely
hidden
and
warms
you
quickly
as
this
one
goes
down
obviously
a
worldclass
brew
which
is
certainly
worth
the
price
simply
exudes
luxury
ive
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
a
while
to
see
if
its
as
good
as
everyone
says
it
is
im
usually
skeptical
of
dopples
as
ive
only
had
a
few
i
really
like
the
cloying
sweetness
in
some
of
them
gets
to
me
anyway
330
ml
slender
bottle
it
pours
a
browndeep
plum
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
streams
and
a
1
finger
light
brown
head
that
is
dense
and
sooo
creamy
leaving
sheets
of
bubbles
all
the
way
down
the
glass
eventually
turning
into
lace
beautiful
to
say
the
least
smells
of
dark
fruits
caramel
molasses
green
hops
a
grainy
character
and
a
sweetness
that
comes
close
to
candy
but
nowhere
near
cloying
tastes
toasty
with
caramel
molasses
raisins
chocolate
burnt
malts
vinous
malts
greenspicy
hops
and
a
medium
bitterness
i
cant
think
of
how
a
dopple
could
taste
better
than
this
the
body
starts
medium
and
smooth
becoming
thicker
and
softer
as
i
go
this
beer
is
amazing
it
just
dethroned
ruination
as
my
toprated
believe
the
hype
im
getting
at
least
a
four
pack
next
time
this
was
my
first
dopplebock
and
all
i
can
say
is
give
me
more
this
was
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
pour
leaves
a
brownish
beer
which
lightens
as
your
near
the
bottle
the
head
is
a
foamy
white
taste
is
malty
but
not
overdown
or
buttery
the
flavor
really
exploded
on
this
one
as
the
temp
increased
with
no
hints
of
the
alcohol
just
the
incredible
malts
i
bought
this
in
a
four
pack
which
was
four
months
out
of
suggested
serving
time
and
still
loved
this
i
also
had
this
on
tap
at
redbones
a
few
weeks
back
and
it
was
wonderful
as
well
i
didnt
review
it
at
that
time
as
i
was
eating
the
kick
ass
buffalo
shrimp
and
wasnt
in
the
note
taking
mood
pours
a
good
head
and
is
dark
and
inviting
smells
good
like
a
malty
sweet
beer
it
has
a
strong
coffee
flavor
thats
combined
with
a
nice
hoppy
after
taste
its
a
smooth
beer
and
is
drinkable
its
flavor
is
strong
but
that
doesnt
deter
you
from
drinking
it
down
it
holds
a
good
lacing
till
the
end
and
warms
you
nicely
damn
what
a
good
beer
delicious
to
the
last
drop
one
of
those

boozier

mouthfeel
is
huge
creamy
and
chewy
for
such
a
big
and
bold
beer
this
is
quite
drinkable
my
first
doppelbock
and
ill
definitely
be
seeking
some
more
pours
a
dark

with
bright
burgundy
highlights
with
a
creamy

that
left
nice

smells
a
smokey

of
mandarin
sourness
molasses
and
a
burnt

sweet

potent
as
this

will
like

enjoy

the
max
maybe
litle

maltsweetness
in

with

however
i
love
it
great
brew
that
i
enjoyed
all
the
way
drinkability
nicely
drinkable
and
this
is
a
great
version
of
the
style
my
first
foray
in
to
the
world
of
bocks
im
a
selfprofesed
malt
lover
however
i
found
the
body
to
be
a
bit
lean
and
the
taste
sligthly
acidic
both
of
which
detracted
from
my
enjoyment
of
this
brews
worldclass
malt
profile
i
dont
want
to
give
the
idea
that
i
didnt
like
this
beer
its
quite
good
but
im
not
sure
if
it
quite
deserves
its
reputation
in
my
opinion
but
what
do
i
know
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
almost
proter
dark
with
a
finger
of
khaki
head
that
wanes
but
never
vanishes
nose
is
heavy
on
the
caramel
malts
go
figure
with
some
coffee
and
some
interesting
raisinprunedate
notes
smells
like
some
baltic
porter
found
its
way
into
my
bottle
taste
is
similar
with
dense
carameltoffee
malts
and
some
dark
fruity
notes
with
hints
of
coffee
grounds
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
chewy
the
alcohol
very
subdued
overall
a
very
interesting
dopplebock
again
with
surprising
baltic
porter
qualities
its
good
i
dont
know
about
13th
best
beer
in
the
world
good
though
still
a
unique
beer
worth
trying
the
mouthfeel
its
full
almost
sticky
but
not
it
feels
your
mouth
but
keeps
you
wanting
more
after
my
first
i
easily
could
keep
drinking
it
doesnt
go
down
super
fast
but
its
still
really
really
nice
great
beer
i
am
for
sure
buying
alot
more
of
the
celebrator
for
tomorrow
night
excellent
dopplebock
although
paulaner
salvator
is
a
bit
better
in
my
opinion
opinion
i
am
a
big
fan
of
doppelbocks
and
they
probably
make
up
a
third
of
the
beers
i
make
this
is
one
fine
example
of
the
style
most
homebrewers
any
more
think
that
this
style
should
be
really
big
but
this
beer
comes
in
at
6
7
that
isnt
too
big
but
it
doesnt
lack
flavor
due
to
the
alcohol
content
being
on
the
low
side
for
the
style
this
is
a
world
class
beer
and
one
to
be
enjoyed
the
malts
are
huge
here
so
depending
on
how
much
you
like
that
aspect
will
determine
how
drinkable
this
is
im
still
new
to
the
doppelbock
realm
only
my
second
so
im
still
acquiring
the
taste
for
what
im
looking
for
it
made
it
a
slow
goer
for
me
but
one
i
enjoyed
while
it
went
overall
lots
of
hype
with
this
beer
but
all
in
all
it
held
up
pretty
well
to
my
expections
the
best
thing
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
although
it
has
a
lot
of
different
flavors
going
on
its
nicely
balanced
probably
the
doppelbock
to
judge
all
other
doppelbocks
by
poured
for
me
at
tria
in
philly
nice
head
very
dark
black
mouthfeel
is
thick
roasted
flavors
throughout
chocolate
malt
at
the
forefront
of
the
taste
in
the
higher
range
of
alcohol
perecentages
but
eminenently
drinkable
worth
the
15
i
paid
for
the
4
pack
including
tax
great
with
pork
an
apple
cranberry
sauce
buttered
red
potatoes
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
dopplebock
style
and
this
brew
is
a
fine
example
pours
a
dark
copperish
color
with
a
nice
light
tan
head
about
an
inch
thick
smells
of
sticky
fruit
raisons
very
slight
citrus
and
very
sweet
delicious
sweet
caramelmolasses
flavor
up
front
with
some
fruitiness
lightly
bready
and
has
slight
alcohol
in
the
after
taste
very
smooth
this
is
a
complex
beer
that
has
flavors
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
this
would
maybe
pair
well
with
a
strong
beef
stew
pours
dark
dark
red
with
a
finger
and
a
half
head
that
fizzles
down
and
leaves
a
veil
of
bubbles
over
the
top
of
the
beer
for
some
reason
when
i
smelled
this
all
i
could
think
of
were
concord
grapes
even
though
there
is
absolutely
nothing
that
has
to
do
with
concord
grapes
and
this
very
odd
anyway
there
is
a
nice
roasty
malt
and
hop
nose
and
it
brings
to
mind
bannana
nut
crunch
cereal
i
actually
held
up
a
box
of
this
to
my
nose
then
smelled
the
celebrator
and
im
quite
positive
thats
what
it
smells
like
theres
also
prevelent
alcohol
in
the
nose
alright
time
to
taste
this
well
well
this
is
not
what
i
expected
to
taste
the
only
other
doppelbock
ive
had
is
hookers
liberator
and
that
had
a
tremendous
chocolate
taste
this
on
the
other
hand
tastes
of
bread
crackers
cereal
etc
definately
very
interesting
and
triguing
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
if
pressed
going
to
definately
be
picking
up
a
four
pack
the
next
time
i
go
to
yankee
celebrator
was
okay
but
honestly
this
seems
more
like
a
weird
nut
brown
ale
than
a
doppelbock
lager
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
would
probably
end
up
feeling
overly
full
it
is
a
nice
easy
fall
drinking
doppelbock
very
filling
the
only
tangible
downside
to
this
beer
is
the
sheer
weight
of
it
its
thick
as
hell
and
quite
strong
a
few
sips
of
this
and
my
stomach
is
getting
pretty
heavyl
yow
not
a
session
beer
but
definitely
one
worth
sipping
and
pondering
does
ayinger
make
cologne
or
mouthwash
i
can
only
wish
clearly
a
winner
in
my
book
ive
heard
so
much
about
this
beer
from
ba
that
i
just
had
to
grab
a
fourpack
at
sams
wine
and
liqour
on
butterfield
in
downers
grove
il
when
held
directly
into
the
light
it
almost
takes
on
a
dried
blood
color
but
when
not
directly
in
the
light
the
color
is
a
dark
chololate
brown
the
smell
is
of
a
pleasant
toffee
and
malt
note
the
beer
itself
is
any
easy
swalow
which
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
such
a
dark
beer
this
easy
drinkability
allows
the
drinker
to
let
it
be
absorbed
by
the
palate
to
soak
as
much
flavor
as
possible
the
taste
mimics
the
smell
exactly
with
a
clean
smooth
finish
this
dopplebock
ent
well
with
hamburger
and
a
cold
tomato
onion
gespacho
very
nicely
this
stuff
is
scarily
drinkable
i
had
to
open
a
second
and
let
it
sit
so
i
could
try
this
warmer
id
finished
the
first
bottle
without
giving
it
any
time
to
warm
up
by
accident
definitely
the
best
dopplebock
ive
had
so
far
uf
drinkability
above
average
overall
a
good
double
bock
pretty
filling
stuff
great
beer
for
celebrating
oktoberfest
creamy
smooth
and
rich
full
bodied
but
very
easy
to
drink
and
well
worth
a
try
especially
for
fall
and
winter
drinkability
an
excellent
example
of
a
dopplebock
that
you
can
drink
all
day
a
11
2
oz
bottle
really
doesnt
go
that
far
a
must
try
2
bucks
a
bottle
at
the
fresno
bevmo
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
ruby
and
caramel
highlights
topped
by
a
light
creamy
tan
head
amazing
aroma
not
unlike
freshly
baked
bread
rich
malt
pleasant
yeast
raisin
and
a
ton
of
brown
sugar
palate
is
deeply
rich
redolent
of
roasted
malt
dried
fruit
raisin
prune
and
brown
sugar
aftertaste
is
a
lingering
sweetness
body
is
nice
and
substantial
and
a
tad
bit
syrupy
a
good
warming
beer
for
sipping
on
a
fall
evening
pours
an
absolutely
beautiful
deep
mahogany
with
garnet
highlights
and
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
that
retains
well
aroma
is
very
malty
with
scents
of
toasted
bread
rum
soaked
prunes
caramel
molasses
and
alcohol
flavor
is
complex
and
very
rich
definately
a
meal
in
a
bottle
tastes
of
toasted
bread
caramel
rum
soaked
raisins
and
prunes
and
a
slightly
floral
and
mineraly
hops
compliment
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
overwhelming
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
huge
body
and
light
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
excellent
cheers
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
tight
tan
head
up
top
nice
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
aroma
of
malt
molasses
and
caramel
come
to
mind
there
is
also
a
roasted
feel
going
on
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
there
taste
is
big
taste
of
molasses
and
malt
there
is
a
slight
play
with
the
alcohol
in
there
and
a
dry
hop
feeling
mixed
in
as
well
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
a
nice
mellow
carbonation
as
well
overall
wow
this
is
a
thinner
beer
than
i
expected
but
it
really
doesnt
detract
from
the
superior
flavor
this
beer
is
too
potent
to
rapidly
consume
but
it
does
go
down
easily
seek
out
and
enjoy
time
to
celebrate
this
beer
has
a
color
that
is
similar
to
coke
almost
jet
black
but
dark
translucent
red
near
the
edges
the
smell
is
like
candied
fruits
especially
apricot
the
taste
is
stellar
it
has
a
large
body
but
not
an
overwhelming
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
also
great
with
it
going
down
like
a
normal
liquid
and
not
ephervessing
too
much
on
the
tongue
definitly
a
drink
you
could
have
more
than
one
of
if
it
werent
for
the
price
drinkability
pretty
good
overall
drinkability
this
will
be
a
fine
lead
in
to
the
rest
of
the
evening
looked
like
pepsi
in
my
glass
but
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
fell
not
long
after
arriving
the
smell
was
slightly
nutty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
roasty
malts
and
some
sort
of
sweetness
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
the
taste
was
bready
with
some
but
not
much
sweetness
and
roasted
malty
goodness
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
mildly
carbonated
and
very
smooth
this
was
so
good
that
i
had
to
have
another
excellent
beer
immensely
drinkable
what
a
quality
example
of
this
style
i
wish
i
could
find
this
locally
i
would
purchase
a
case
without
second
thought
pours
a
cola
colored
brown
with
a
thick
foamy
head
which
goes
away
quickly
not
much
carbonation
visible
or
maybe
its
just
hidden
in
the
darkness
nice
sweet
rich
malty
aroma
not
much
going
on
in
the
hops
department
sorry
hopheads
taste
is
initial
sweet
maltiness
with
a
little
dark
fruit
in
the
background
the
finish
is
dry
spicy
and
a
little
bit
smoky
overall
a
smooth
complex
very
tasty
brew
that
lives
up
to
all
its
accolades
taste
is
stouty
lots
of
coffee
and
roasted
flavors
in
there
chocolate
and
caramel
complete
the
background
with
a
hint
of
hops
somewhere
in
there
tasty
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
bubbly
and
full
and
id
say
this
is
decently
drinkable
its
a
solid
beer
but
a
tad
too
heavy
to
drink
a
lot
of
still
a
tasty
concoction
one
id
have
again
poured
beautifully
from
a
bottle
into
my
favorite
beer
consumption
glass
a
nice
tan
head
appeared
that
disappated
as
i
let
it
sit
for
a
few
moments
taking
in
the
smell
it
poured
a
deep
red
to
brown
color
the
first
two
words
that
came
to
my
head
upon
first
sniff
were
malty
and
fruity
plums
or
dates
i
think
the
first
taste
unveiled
a
nice
roasted
finish
with
the
definite
fruity
backbone
dare
i
say
like
a
young
barley
wine
i
felt
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
lucious
quite
enjoyable
and
would
definitely
have
a
couple
more
why
the
goats
look
like
rams
on
the
bottle
dont
know
mmm
there
is
a
distinct
burnt
coffee
flavor
to
this
that
is
excellent
i
was
afraid
this
my
be
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
based
on
the
aromas
but
that
is
not
the
case
here
carbonation
is
fine
and
well
balanced
slight
alcohol
bite
at
finish
is
welcome
had
to
deduct
a
little
on
mouthfeel
as
it
got
a
bit
watery
on
the
bottom
half
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
doppelbock
so
far
anyways
overall
i
know
its
easy
to
say
that
michael
jordan
is
the
best
ever
basketball
player
but
quite
simply
this
is
the
best
doppelbock
ive
had
to
date
absolutely
delicious
pours
a
brown
cola
with
a
nice
mochatan
head
bubbles
rise
from
within
the
smell
is
of
apples
covered
in
caramel
a
slight
buttery
yeast
biscuits
and
jelly
malts
ar
fruity
cherries
and
sweet
the
taste
is
facinating
crisp
and
refreshing
apple
pie
with
roasted
pecans
a
nice
biscuit
layer
coated
with
honey
sap
the
fruits
are
pleasant
slight
floral
hop
lively
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
king
of
all
this
is
the
best
looking
and
feeling
beer
i
have
ever
had
if
it
were
the
best
tasting
i
wouldnt
bother
buying
anything
else
pours
a
dark
opaque
brown
with
a
full
three
fingers
of
bubbly
tan
head
that
stays
all
over
the
glass
i
actually
didnt
know
much
beer
i
had
left
in
the
glass
because
the
lacing
covered
up
where
it
was
aroma
is
dark
bready
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
spicy
alcohol
taste
has
a
hint
of
raisin
thick
roasted
maltiness
and
a
nice
supportive
hop
bitterness
along
with
an
alcoholic
presence
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
the
thick
velvety
mouthfeel
which
i
have
experienced
nowhere
else
even
in
stouts
absolutely
stunning
please
transport
me
to
bavaria
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
quite
some
time
and
im
glad
that
i
did
the
top
100
ba
beers
that
ive
had
have
made
for
a
great
guideline
when
beer
hunting
there
was
one
saving
grace
here
a
really
faint
hint
of
sweetness
that
added
a
little
bit
of
depth
dont
get
me
wrong
there
was
no
alcohol
flavor
and
there
was
absolutely
no
hops
bite
here
and
the
mouthfeel
was
huge
and
chewy
with
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
present
if
this
was
your
type
of
drink
the
drinkability
here
is
very
good
3
or
4
would
not
be
out
of
the
question
if
you
had
the
intestinal
fortitude
and
a
designated
driver
pours
an
incredible
combination
of
red
and
deep
deep
brown
combining
at
places
to
a
purplish
hue
decent
head
which
dissipates
fairly
quickly
little
to
no
lacing
after
the
first
few
sips
smell
is
of
molasses
sugary
figs
small
hints
of
caramel
warm
wheat
bread
crust
tastes
heavily
of
molasses
woody
earthy
notes
bread
and
a
slight
but
pleasing
alcoholic
flavor
if
you
ever
had
it
this
beer
has
one
of
the
strongest
acai
tastes
brazillian
fruit
that
ive
ever
tasted
without
acai
actually
being
present
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
good
thing
as
i
like
acai
sort
of
that
chocolately
but
fruity
sweet
funk
take
it
for
what
you
will
but
that
was
my
impression
wonderful
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
despite
the
aforementioned
alcoholic
presence
in
the
taste
which
again
is
very
pleasing
rather
than
overpowering
or
abrasive
overall
a
wonderful
wonderful
brew
in
the
home
of
doppelbock
here
is
the
champ
it
has
been
a
favorite
and
its
a
no
doubt
recommendation
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
34
of
tan
head
over
the
dark
amber
brew
head
lasts
well
with
average
to
good
lacing
aroma
is
incredible
sweet
malts
and
nuttiness
like
you
wouldnt
believe
taste
is
just
what
the
nose
portended
although
maybe
a
little
less
so
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
incredible
for
the
style
a
standard
for
dbocks
for
sure
this
is
a
heavy
beer
best
for
slow
drinking
definitely
recommend
this
if
not
already
tried
and
if
you
have
tried
go
have
another
this
beer
pours
a
very
very
dark
brown
almost
black
very
little
light
can
get
threw
this
brew
this
bock
smells
of
caramel
roasted
nuts
and
figs
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
very
delicious
i
taste
the
sweetness
of
the
caramel
some
nutty
flavors
and
some
dark
fruit
plumfigs
all
combine
together
and
bring
out
some
incredible
tastes
on
the
palate
this
is
definatly
a
sipping
brew
one
that
can
warm
you
up
on
a
winter
day
overall
i
find
this
beer
very
enjoyable
drinkable
indeed
but
also
meaty
it
is
smooth
and
comfortable
with
a
very
nice
aroma
and
a
rich
body
final
thought
this
and
aventinus
are
the
clear
champions
in
the
bock
variety
which
has
quickly
become
my
favorite
style
in
german
brews
a
classic
beer
celebrator
is
one
of
the
few
true
dopplebocks
the
exemplifly
the
style
to
perfection
could
it
use
a
bit
more
complexity
on
the
fruits
and
a
bit
more
balance
on
the
lageredoxidized
front
maybe
but
no
faults
here
appearance
is
a
rich
brown
ochre
with
a
coffee
colored
foam
that
is
so
thick
it
is
heavy

and
leaves
lacing
that
stays
to
the
end
aroma
has
yeasty
bread
raisins
and
molasses
toffee
ethanol
pumpkin
pie
spices
hops
and
lots
of
malt
initial
taste
is
all
of
the
above
with
bitter
hops
balancing
out
the
sweetness
beautifully
plums
and
currants
are
present
and
the
sweet
after
finish
leaves
one
wanting
some
spice
cake
or
mincemeat
pie
mouth
feel
is
like
drinking
a
malt
not
much
carbonation
compare
side
by
side
with
salvator
sometime
interesting
love
this
stuff
the
mouthfeel
has
an
almost
stout
like
velvetiness
very
smooth
and
one
hell
of
a
highly
drinkable
doppelbock
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
i
cant
wait
for
some
more
this
is
my
first
doppelbock
poured
into
a
celebrator
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
very
nice
head
which
disipates
pretty
quick
but
leaves
a
very
nice
lacing
has
a
sweet
malty
scent
wow
i
really
love
the
taste
of
this
brew
light
body
and
very
social
drinkability
i
would
recommend
this
brew
very
highly
speaking
of
recommending
i
recommended
this
to
a
lady
at
the
liquor
store
yesterday
but
once
she
saw
the
price
of
2
45
a
bottle
4pack
she
said
she
was
going
to
walmart
instead
rotfflmao
so
far
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
black
with
caramel
creamy
head
about
1
52
inches
of
head
from
a
fairly
aggressive
pour
rich
malty
aroma
with
some
light
fruity
smells
almost
like
a
dry
red
wine
creamy
full
bodied
taste
with
slight
fruitiness
to
it
subtle
chocolatey
tones
cant
taste
the
coffee
aspect
but
i
have
before
in
this
brew
less
aftertaste
than
i
have
noticed
before
big
take
away
from
this
tasting
was
the
noticeable
fruity
notes
that
i
couldn
t
detect
before
this
has
always
been
one
of
my
most
sought
after
beers
and
i
will
continue
drinking
it
but
my
quest
for
the
perfect
beer
must
go
on
a
fantastic
doppelbock
for
sure
an
easily
drinkable
beer
but
i
would
like
to
follow
it
with
something
different
its
ultra
smooth
and
creamy
with
fabulous
foam
and
body
it
aint
just
hype
or
the
power
of
suggestion
its
a
wonderful
doppelbock
after
drinking
this
brew
many
many
more
times
i
have
to
say
that
this
brew
holds
up
to
a
changing
palate
amazingly
well
i
enjoy
it
now
as
much
as
the
time
when
i
first
tried
it
perhaps
even
more
while
ive
had
1520
other
doppelbocks
that
are
all
wonderful
only
the
andechs
and
korbinian
can
keep
pace
with
celebrator
the
chocolateraisin
profile
is
unique
and
simply
amazing
i
think
this
beer
is
an
easy
candidate
for
the
best
overall
in
the
world
ill
have
to
try
another
bottle
in
hopes
that
itll
be
a
little
better
drinkability
i
can
just
see
myself
at
the
local
pub
hoisting
stein
after
stein
of
this
stuff
must
buy
a
case
12
oz
bottle
obtained
from
johns
grocery
iowa
city
and
consumed
a
couple
evenings
later
june
2005
pours
a
twofinger
light
brown
head
over
a
dark
brown
crystal
clear
liquid
smells
wafting
up
during
the
pour
were
sugar
caramel
toffee
and
alcohol
to
the
nose
i
get
a
dry
chalky
malt
caramel
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
ho
baby
this
tastes
incredible
overall
its
wet
sweet
with
distinct
caramel
and
so
malty
it
tastes
like
barley
grains
it
starts
with
a
slowly
rising
sweetness
that
ushers
a
sudden
caramel
zomp
yea
i
said
zomp
right
after
the
caramel
hits
theres
a
nice
dry
chocolate
with
hints
of
nutty
an
alcohol
sting
plays
quietly
behind
these
candy
flavors
and
is
tamed
by
a
sugary
sweet
oh
what
a
divine
combination
each
flavor
works
well
with
the
others
and
is
at
an
appropriate
level
to
satisfy
after
the
swallow
the
alcohol
gets
a
bit
strong
no
surprise
thats
usual
and
the
chocolate
dries
out
a
bit
i
was
hoping
the
aftertaste
would
hold
a
final
transition
to
new
flavors
but
i
didnt
get
that
experience
the
bock
character
is
present
but
not
as
strong
as
i
would
have
liked
i
wont
detract
from
my
scoring
of
the
beer
as
i
know
i
like
strong
bock
character
which
wouldnt
be
to
style
mediumthick
almost
thick
mouthfeel
with
mild
carbonation
dang
the
head
just
broke
leaving
a
bare
spot
on
the
surface
last
gulp
here
i
come
drinkability
a
good
tasting
and
versatile
brew
not
really
a
summer
brew
but
im
not
faulting
it
for
the
season
it
has
me
looking
forward
to
winter
months
pours
a
decent
reddish
black
color
and
has
a
thin
tan
head
my
thoughts
on
the
first
sip
are
that
it
is
a
decent
doppelbock
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
it
is
commonly
bragged
up
to
be
it
has
a
decent
sweet
malty
aroma
and
a
very
sweet
taste
burnt
caramel
and
a
roasted
malt
bite
paulaner
owns
me
in
this
category
i
have
three
more
of
these
in
the
cellar
i
will
drink
them
at
some
point
or
trade
them
with
some
friends
who
have
a
higher
apprectiation
for
this
beer
the
beer
has
a
good
body
to
it
but
this
can
only
entice
the
taste
buds
so
much
drinkability
is
average
but
can
be
greatly
increased
when
paired
with
a
meal
i
used
this
beer
to
marinate
my
roast
last
night
it
was
an
expensive
choice
but
the
best
ive
made
so
far
pours
a
rich
deep
thick
brown
body
with
ruby
highlights
a
dense
thick
head
with
great
retention
and
good
lacing
aroma
of
prunes
caramel
toasted
malt
and
sweetness
complex
taste
of
sweet
malt
caramel
toasted
flavours
and
slight
alcohol
ends
dry
sweet
and
very
satisfying
thick
smooth
mouthfeel
full
bodied
and
extremely
well
crafted
pours
a
deep
dark
blackbrown
with
a
big
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
settles
down
with
generous
lacing
smells
earthy
dark
malts
little
sweet
dark
fruits
as
well
malt
body
really
coats
the
tongue
dark
cherries
molasses
sweet
malt
irony
taste
full
and
creamy
on
the
mouth
perfect
carbonation
levels
this
is
definately
a
world
class
brew
dn
easily
one
of
the
finest
beers
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
its
really
hard
to
find
fault
anywhere
with
this
beer
im
no
expert
but
this
one
seems
to
be
the
standard
of
the
style
just
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
highest
recommendations
ring
a
ding
ding
whew
this
beer
pours
a
a
deep
lustrous
brown
like
jaclyn
smiths
hair
back
in
the
70s
foamy
head
and
lacing
looks
delicious
again
like
j
s
in
the
70s
smell
is
toasty
sweet
malt
and
molasses
taste
is
even
better
roasted
malt
coffee
and
oh
so
smooth
fullbodied
and
satisfying
ive
had
it
on
tap
but
it
was
served
too
cold
this
is
outstanding
i
had
this
after
my
college
graduation
and
its
name
was
very
appropriate
for
the
quality
of
the
beer
i
highly
recommend
this
for
anyone
who
wants
to
taste
a
great
example
of
the
style
this
brew
grows
on
you
the
first
taste
is
underwhelming
subsequent
tastes
unleash
a
myriad
of
flavors
which
are
subtle
yet
so
complex
biscuit
like
malts
and
mellow
hops
linger
a
bit
after
drinks
but
definitely
not
an
intrusive
taste
very
well
balanced
not
an
in
your
face
brew
very
drinkable
although
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
resinous
and
chewy
delicious
a
good
session
beer
in
my
opinion
huge
2finger
frothy
tannish
head
on
top
of
blackish
beer
with
reddish
tints
some
lacing
going
down
with
good
web
of
lacing
aromas
of
dark
chocolate
and
cherry
tastes
were
similar
again
with
the
cocoa
powder
with
hints
of
coffee
with
little
bitterness
and
some
fruit
especially
dark
cherry
aftertaste
is
dry
with
sot
of
hot
cocoa
feel
and
slight
bitterness
a
great
session
beer
one
of
the
best
its
a
beautiful
slowsipping
beer
a
deep
rich
classic
brew
highly
recommended
dangerously
drinkable
do
give
it
a
try
tastemouthfeeldrinkability
liquid
caramel
toffee
malts
and
molasses
as
described
above
flow
seamlessly
over
the
tongue
and
finish
with
an
incredibly
appropriate
bitterness
that
takes
nothing
away
from
the
overall
sweet
story
what
begins
as
a
showcase
of
individual
songs
becomes
so
well
balanced
that
by
the
time
you
are
finishing
your
glass
the
integration
is
a
symphonic
treasure
a
very
good
beer
that
i
will
likely
have
again
for
a
special
occasion
i
think
this
one
would
be
great
around
christmas
and
the
new
year
spiced
cake
with
cocoa
dust
canned
cherry
pie
topping
a
husky
voice
tobacco
some
strong
orange
pekoe
burnt
walnuts
i
could
drink
this
from
noon
to
passing
out
whenever
with
a
pretzel
and
mustard
one
of
the
better
german
exports
this
beer
is
a
bit
of
an
extension
for
me
i
am
wary
of
beers
with
shelflives
of
who
knows
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
i
can
imagine
this
going
well
with
a
medium
rare
pork
tenderloin
i
will
try
again
but
i
am
not
going
out
of
my
way
for
it
i
had
heard
a
lot
about
this
beer
and
never
got
around
to
trying
it
until
last
night
at
the
moan
and
dove
good
but
not
quite
what
i
expected
nice
poofy
head
on
top
of
a
dark
brown
ale
with
bubbles
smell
was
really
nice
malty
and
roasty
and
with
a
nice
milky
character
in
the
taste
that
milky
creamy
characteristic
was
really
the
only
thing
that
made
it
stand
out
yeah
the
nice
roasted
toasted
chocolaty
coffee
taste
was
nice
but
nothing
i
havent
come
across
before
in
a
variety
of
styles
it
seemed
like
this
beer
didnt
really
know
if
it
was
a
brown
ale
or
a
dopplebock
or
a
stout
the
mouthfeel
didnt
match
up
with
the
taste
it
was
a
little
thin
and
too
carbonated
in
my
opinion
this
is
tasty
for
sure
but
i
was
expecting
something
more
along
the
lines
of
a
real
dopplebock
like
aventius
or
something
but
then
again
everyone
else
on
the
site
seems
to
think
this
stuff
is
the
cream
of
the
crop
so
to
each
his
own
i
paid
8
99
for
4
bottles
poured
a
clear
dark
red
almost
black
brew
with
a
tan
head
that
subsided
quickly
probably
due
to
the
alcohol
content
and
low
carbonation
the
aroma
was
very
indicative
of
munich
malt
and
had
a
touch
of
roasted
grains
that
was
very
clean
the
flavor
is
very
good
for
a
doppelbock
as
it
begins
with
a
touch
of
hops
blended
in
with
a
very
rich
toasted
malt
flavor
that
has
a
touch
of
chocolate
malt
or
some
other
dark
malt
in
the
finish
the
body
is
very
full
and
lends
a
smoothness
that
is
also
accented
by
the
lower
levels
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
tasty
dark
lager
with
a
nice
level
of
alcohol
so
that
if
you
only
want
to
drink
one
beer
you
can
choose
one
of
these
and
get
a
nice
buzz
acompanied
with
a
delicious
flavor
pours
a
deep
ruby
color
with
a
tightly
knit
head
good
lacing
aroma
is
outstandingly
complex
dried
fruits
sweet
malts
and
caramel
play
in
there
as
well
taste
is
complex
as
well
some
bitter
chocolate
play
off
the
malts
well
to
keep
a
roasted
balance
to
the
sweetness
ive
got
to
knock
this
one
on
mouthfeel
slightly
thin
and
overcarbonated
for
a
dopplebock
in
my
mind
overall
a
good
drinking
beer
as
im
still
drinking
i
feel
like
i
could
have
cases
and
cases
of
this
stuff
and
be
happy
curious
to
see
what
a
year
does
in
the
cellar
much
potential
is
here
for
it
age
pretty
well
though
i
imagine
not
beyond
a
year
or
two
but
who
knows
definitely
give
this
a
shot
doppelbock
fan
or
not
as
i
stated
earlier
a
4pack
wont
break
the
wallet
and
this
stuffs
a
real
treat
thankfully
i
can
buy
4packs
readily
available
as
this
will
surely
become
a
staple
for
me
this
is
the
standard
which
all
other
dopplebocks
should
be
judged
the
world
is
a
far
better
place
with
this
beer
in
it
sensational
offering
from
a
stellar
brewery
cheers
mouthfeel
has
a
big
creamy
body
that
makes
its
presence
known
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
see
a
four
pack
night
of
celebrator
no
problem
just
a
damn
fine
doppelbock
and
a
testament
to
malt
notes
a
testament
to
german
beer
making
finally
the
esteemed
celebrator
with
plastic
goat
trinket
wow
easy
pour
produced
a
massive
tan
head
on
top
on
a
clear
mahogany
elixir
nice
aroma
of
malt
and
raisons
wonderful
rich
maltly
liquorish
tasty
treat
with
an
alcohol
buzz
looks
thin
but
has
a
good
firm
body
double
bockgimme
another
one
or
two
mouthfeel
is
acceptable
and
this
beer
would
be
best
served
with
an
order
of
bangers
or
fish
and
chips
this
brew
is
alright
i
may
be
persuaded
to
try
this
one
again
i
would
prefer
to
have
something
else
if
i
had
my
druthers
though
nice
goat
fine
beer
no
tremendous
fuss
tastes
a
bit
rotten
this
one
went
down
terribly
fast
not
intentionallyi
was
going
to
have
it
with
sauerbrauten
but
it
was
gone
before
the
food
was
ready
lived
up
to
the
hype
worth
the
price
neat
little
plastic
goat
there
too
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
smidgeon
of
a
white
head
releasing
a
sweet
malty
nutty
aroma
caramel
malts
and
just
enough
subtle
hop
presence
to
provide
a
good
balance
and
nice
flavor
improving
as
it
warms
and
becoming
much
more
flavorful
moderate
abv
and
a
flavor
that
is
by
no
means
overwhelming
make
this
a
pretty
good
session
beer
although
im
not
a
fan
of
this
style
with
the
exception
of
aventinus
this
beer
impressed
me
i
can
see
why
so
many
people
give
it
high
marks
im
encouraged
to
explore
other
brews
from
this
style
what
more
can
be
said
about
this
brew
that
hasnt
been
said
already
one
of
the
best
and
deserves
its
classic
status
while
im
not
generally
a
fan
of
doppelbocks
i
really
like
this
one
very
warming
on
a
cold
winters
night
the
only
bad
thing
is
the
price
3
50
for
this
bottle
great
beer
otherwise
though
drinkability
and
overall
ive
been
waiting
to
try
this
for
a
while
finally
got
to
and
i
have
to
say
it
met
and
surpassed
my
expectations
complex
powerful
and
well
rounded
this
is
an
absolute
classic
that
i
could
drink
all
night
i
cant
even
imagine
how
good
this
is
on
tap
one
of
the
worlds
best
deep
brown
pour
with
a
huge
tan
head
sorghum
molasses
raisins
hints
of
coffee
and
faint
cherry
notes
are
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
pure
doppelbocky
goodness
sweet
with
lots
of
malt
and
roasted
flavors
to
go
with
some
coffee
chocolate
and
cloves
mouthfeel
is
perfectly
rich
and
creamy
drinkability
is
fantastic
you
could
spend
all
night
just
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
hues
at
the
edges
with
a
small
head
over
top
the
nose
was
slightly
raisiney
and
slightly
roasted
the
flavor
on
this
one
is
what
i
consider
to
be
a
doppelbock
there
were
slight
chocolate
and
roasted
tones
but
also
a
sweet
dark
raisiney
bit
the
feel
was
thick
and
smooth
just
fantastic
a
highly
enjoyable
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
very
good
show
had
this
at
a
tasting
pours
a
very
dark
color
with
a
tan
head
that
has
great
retention
and
leaves
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
wonderful
lots
of
good
maltyness
coffee
syrup
caramel
sweetness
the
flavor
is
quite
good
as
well
lots
of
dark
malts
along
with
some
coffee
and
chocolate
very
thick
body
drinkability
is
very
good
great
brew
here
pours
a
deep
dark
opaque
brown
with
a
thick
rootbeer
browntan
head
very
nice
in
fact
beautiful
this
is
what
beer
should
look
like
aroma
is
roasty
sweet
molassas
and
brandiedcandied
cherries
rich
just
begging
me
to
drink
it
there
is
some
unidentified
complexity
yeast
that
gives
it
a
bit
of
added
tartness
maybe
weak
hop
notes
but
not
certain
flavor
is
toffee
coffee
that
is
incredibly
well
balanced
bready
sweet
with
light
shaprness
at
the
end
of
the
swallow
a
great
dessert
even
though
its
not
all
sweetness
mouthfeel
lush
and
rich
drinkability
really
rich
that
makes
it
a
slow
drinker
rather
than
a
gulper
couldnt
have
more
than
1
or
maybe
2
in
an
evening
but
worth
repeating
the
process
once
upon
a
time
this
would
be
considered
the
yardstick
against
which
doppelbocks
were
to
be
measured
however
having
recently
had
a
smuttynose
smuttonator
i
must
say
that
i
was
disappointed
in
having
this
despite
its
advantage
of
being
on
draft
versus
the
smutty
in
the
bottle
altogether
what
i
would
expect
of
a
doublebock
albeit
less
than
the
smutty
a
great
beer
but
i
want
more
joey
suggest
you
set
sort
to
top
reviewers
and
read
this
beers
accolades
your
ears
eyes
nose
tongue
and
palate
are
in
for
a
treat
starting
with
the
popfiz
thru
the
pouring
with
a
malty
yeast
aroma
rishing
along
with
molasses
and
exquisite
esters
taste
perfectly
blended
and
well
described
as
monsterous
includes
deep
roasted
molasses
finishing
with
the
most
perfect
aftertaste
carpe
diem
a
true
classic
i
cant
think
of
anything
to
else
to
say
deep
brown
to
black
color
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
thin
tan
head
wonderful
roast
malt
aroma
with
mild
chocolate
and
caramel
hints
a
candy
lovers
dream
the
light
roast
aroma
develops
into
a
milder
roast
flavor
with
an
amazing
sweetness
and
a
mild
alcohol
warming
nummy
smooth
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
despite
the
alcohol
this
is
truly
the
signature
beer
of
this
style
sampled
as
part
of
a
blind
dopplebock
tasting
in
the
glass
good
old
celebrator
is
such
a
deep
reddish
brown
that
it
approaches
black
with
a
creamy
head
of
tiny
bubbles
molasses
caramel
raisins
in
the
nose
deeply
nuanced
rich
and
velvety
molasses
layered
upon
spicy
noble
hops
sugarcoated
dark
fruits
and
silky
caramel
mild
hints
of
both
smoke
and
vanilla
oak
emerge
as
it
approaches
room
temperature
full
bodied
and
finishes
with
a
long
lasting
slightly
dry
roasted
finish
solid
this
dopplebock
smells
of
figs
and
other
dark
fruits
i
taste
malts
some
caramel
and
brown
sugar
it
leaves
my
mouth
with
a
veil
of
molasses
i
think
this
is
fairly
drinkable
even
at
6
7
abv
a
couple
of
these
goats
are
a
great
match
for
a
winter
weekend
drinkability
one
of
my
first
bocks
that
i
decided
to
drink
at
the
turn
of
the
year
thus
the
name
celebrator
good
choice
ill
he
having
this
one
again
soon
damn
this
stuff
is
good
almost
too
easy
to
drink

the
dopple
by
which
all
others
are
judged
it
was
my
favorite
until
i
discovered

what
im
talkin
here

deep
roasted

caramel
molasses
creme
brule

list
goes
on
and

that
is
possible
extremely
smooth

pours
a
dark
but
clear
burgundy
under
a
one
finger
beige
head
that
is
fairly
thin
and
shortlived
leaving
no
lace
decadently
strong
caramel
malt
nose
with
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
plum
or
red
grape
perhaps
the
mouth
is
very
prickly
yet
heavy
great
feel
the
taste
is
malt
malt
malt
sweet
and
heavy
alcohol
is
also
present
as
is
a
definite
plum
strain
nicely
blended
smooth
as
silk
there
is
just
a
touch
of
hops
adding
a
bit
of
dry
bite
in
the
finish
lingering
as
a
bitter
echo
among
the
sweet
malt
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
nice
drinkable
brew
despite
the
strength
globetrotterette
who
hates
strong
beers
liked
this
one
oh
yeah
i
remembered
it
better
than
this
i
think
it
is
my
own
tastes
and
discernment
that
have
changed
and
not
the
beer
several
hundred
beer
will
do
that
i
suppose
however
it
still
was
an
excellent
brew
comments
im
no
beer
judge
but
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
beers
like
this
are
part
of
the
reason
that
people
rave
about
the
greatness
of
german
beer
overal
i
do
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
dopplebocks
i
have
had
definately
try
it
funky
plastic
ram
with
every
bottle
an
excellent
beer
it
also
makes
a
great
marinade
for
a
steak
by
the
recipe
the
bros
have
up
here
overall
an
excellent
bock
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
frothy
browntan
head
smell
is
malty
and
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
basement
smell
smooth
full
body
tastes
just
like
it
smells
only
stronger
very
enjoyable
just
the
right
amount
of
abv
for
this
beer
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
at
6
7
would
defiantly
enjoy
having
more
of
these
i
think
this
is
the
first
german
double
bock
i
have
ever
tried
but
it
wont
be
my
last
now
that
i
know
what
this
nectar
is
like
comes
in
a
very
nice
bottle
with
a
little
plastic
ram
charm
hanging
around
the
neck
pours
very
dark
brown
with
a
tan
foamy
head
smells
a
bit
like
a
cappucino
and
a
bit
like
a
dank
cellar
interesting
the
taste
is
really
smooth
kind
of
full
flavored
almost
creamy
with
a
bit
of
roasted
coffee
on
my
tounge
also
some
chocolate
flavors
and
a
sweet
molasses
finish
but
not
overly
sweet
very
easy
to
drink
and
it
is
a
little
strong
great
beer
this
is
the
first
time
that
ive
had
a
real
german
double
bock
it
tastes
better
than
other
bocks
ive
had
it
doesnt
have
much
of
a
head
and
little
lacing
its
pretty
damn
dark
good
malt
taste
not
too
sweet
at
all
and
not
too
much
alcohol
taste
a
very
good
beer
and
very
drinkable
highly
recommended
plus
the
bottle
is
cool
as
hell
deep
ruby
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
looks
very
appealingvery
sweet
smelling
with
plenty
of
maltiness
as
well
as
some
dark
fruity
and
molasses
aromas
chocolatey
and
coffee
malt
flavors
the
same
dark
fruitiness
as
in
the
smell
plum
black
cherry
etc
some
rich
butterscotch
as
well
a
bit
of
earthy
grainyness
and
breadlike
flavors
sweet
and
bitter
play
excellently
off
eachother
full
bodied
and
creamy
i
couldnt
imagine
a
more
appropriate
texture
for
this
beer
this
is
an
excellent
bock
but
the
mouthfeel
is
where
it
really
shines
a
bit
rich
but
very
good
pours
a
deep
cola
brown
color
with
a
nice
light
brown
colored
head
bready
grainy
aromas
some
dark
caramel
and
molassestype
aromas
with
a
light
fruitiness
too
mostly
a
malty
assault
on
the
palate
molasses
and
treacle
comes
through
pretty
nicely
theres
some
hops
in
there
too
just
overpowered
with
the
malt
a
little
bit
vinous
and
lightly
astringent
helping
to
balance
the
deep
dark
malt
assault
i
havent
had
a
celebrator
in
about
10
months
and
maybe
its
the
right
time
of
year
now
that
its
getting
chilly
but
it
is
just
hitting
the
spot
its
a
slow
sipper
that
seems
to
develop
finer
characteristics
as
it
warms
nice
velvety
mouthfeel
some
might
say
this
is
too
roasty
for
a
traditional
doppelbock
i
think
it
is
quite
righteous
for
the
style
really
looking
forward
to
sipping
one
by
the
fire
on
a
long
cold
winter
night
beer
is
good
happy
bock
beering
i
have
been
drinking
this
for
about
a
year
now
nice
chocolate
color
tan
long
lasting
head
nice
lacing
excellentlacing
nice
smooth
palate
coffee
and
molesses
with
a
slight
bitter
after
taste
this
brings
back
fond
memories
when
i
was
in
the
army
in
germany
in
a
little
town
of
illishiem
in
1970
sitting
in
a
guest
house
having
a
few
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
30
some
years
this
is
the
beer
i
have
been
looking
for
if
there
is
one
better
would
some
one
let
me
know
this
is
the
only
beer
from
my
ratebeer
com
that
at
this
time
i
have
around
278
beers
rated
that
i
have
reated
all
5s
sensational
body
goes
down
alright
but
these
taste
awful
rich
and
it
would
be
hard
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
in
a
sittingno
matter
how
much
you
might
want
to
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
pleasant
and
balanced
versions
of
a
big
and
challenging
style
that
i
have
ever
tasted
drinkability
overall
a
great
doppelbock
very
flavorful
and
relatively
easy
to
drink
the
nearly
7
abv
is
also
a
nice
touch
beer
is
in
a
simple
yet
elegant
bottle
label
has
2
rams
on
it
for
a
classic
touch
the
beer
pours
to
almost
black
with
just
a
touch
of
red
in
it
there
are
nearly
3
fingers
of
head
that
slowly
goes
back
to
a
thin
layer
there
is
no
lace
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
complex
with
the
malt
hitting
the
nose
the
hardest
with
a
emphasis
on
a
sweetness
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
tasting
doppelbocks
that
i
have
ever
tried
the
taste
is
very
malty
and
sweet
with
the
fruits
coming
though
in
abundance
this
is
a
full
bodied
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
that
i
have
ever
had
notes
a
very
nice
malty
beer
that
i
enjoyed
a
lot
a
good
example
of
the
dopplebock
style
the
drinkability
is
great
i
could
sit
with
a
bunch
of
these
what
a
nice
beer
i
am
totally
impressed
with
this
one
as
close
to
perfection
as
youll
find
very
easy
drinking
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
a
must
have
in
anyones
collection
probably
one
of
my
favorite
versions
of
the
style
if
you
havent
tried
this
one
yet
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
it
asap
cant
say
enough
good
about
this
beer
its
perfection
in
a
glass
the
taste
is
excellent
also
malty
nutty
and
sweet
caramel
the
aftertaste
is
definitely
coffee
tasting
and
slightly
alcoholic
and
also
very
malty
this
is
the
champion
of
double
bocks
in
my
opinion
i
love
the
bottle
with
the
goats
i
cant
wait
until
i
put
up
my
little
beer
christmas
tree
so
i
can
hang
the
goats
on
it
anyway
back
to
the
beer
the
color
is
a
dark
ruby
color
and
the
head
came
out
with
a
nice
thickness
that
went
away
and
the
lacing
is
very
sparce
to
almost
none
the
smell
is
very
malty
with
a
hint
of
toffee
the
taste
has
lots
of
malt
with
hints
of
toffee
figs
chocolate
and
probably
several
other
things
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
as
the
malt
seems
to
stick
to
your
tounge
and
leaves
a
very
pleasant
aftertaste
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
i
could
enjoy
lots
of
it
if
i
had
it
a
dark
brown
beer
with
garnet
highlights
not
much
a
light
brown
head
is
evident
there
is
a
very
inviting
sweet
malty
and
molasses
aroma
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
starts
with
sweet
molasses
and
a
hint
of
coffee
there
is
a
nice
roasted
bitterness
on
the
finish
a
very
enjoyable
drink
dark
brown
wiht
a
reddishmaroon
hue
small
but
persistant
light
tan
head
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
some
sweet
alchohol
tones
mild
sweetness
upfront
with
good
malty
richness
and
an
slightly
dry
and
bitter
palate
similar
to
a
sweet
coffee
flavorful
and
coating
mouthfeel
but
not
too
heavy
overall
a
delightful
beer
this
is
one
of
the
first
beer
that
turned
me
on
to
good
beer
over
a
decade
ago
recommended
ng
the
flavors
are
subtle
and
tend
to
come
together
very
late
making
this
the
antithesis
of
the
trendy
glut
of
overaggressive
beers
currently
being
produced
delicately
rich
and
malty
celebrator
is
elegant
and
complex
and
my
daughter
likes
the
goat
we
use
to
get
this
beer
in
bc
and
it
is
a
shame
it
no
longer
available
as
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
top
3
german
beers
the
nose
is
huge
with
yeasty
malty
notes
dipped
in
treacle
what
really
struck
me
tasting
this
beer
after
a
gap
of
3
years
is
the
bigness
of
flavours
lots
of
malt
with
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
a
true
classic
something
special
from
brooklynboy
for
my
200th
reviewthanks
very
much
ed
you
are
a
priest
of
the
yeast
i
have
anticipated
savoring
a
celebrator
for
some
time
this
bottled
version
is
pasteurized
i
suspect
but
it
still
does
not
detract
from
this
beers
reputation
the
pour
revealed
a
deep
mahogany
red
liquid
with
a
2
finger
rocky
mocha
cap
that
reduces
in
its
own
sweet
time
to
a
lasting
sticky
lacemild
to
medium
carbonation
wow
what
a
bouquet
of
malts
we
have
dried
fruits
licorice
molasses
tangerines
and
a
lovely
musty
earthy
over
tone
the
start
is
all
big
tasty
malts
with
a
dozen
different
maltroasthopyeast
departures
that
are
so
complex
they
escape
my
eloquence
to
enunciate
thema
veritable
orgasm
of
the
taste
buds
rich
mouth
feel
without
being
heavy
or
sweet
fantastic
balance
for
a
dopple
bock
finish
is
medium
with
the
toffee
chocolate
tastes
receding
and
the
hops
creating
a
wet
lasting
impression
of
treacle
and
limethen
a
nice
warming
infinitely
the
best
drinkable
dopple
bock
in
the
world
ed
thanksand
more
please
note
my
original
review
has
since
been
edited
something
mustve
been
up
with
my
taste
buds
or
bottle
i
had
the
first
time
around
due
to
a
recent
tasting
of
a
certainly
fresh
bottle
ive
had
to
rerate
this
beer
accordingly
bottle
poured
a
dark
black
beer
with
a
huge
foamy
offwhite
head
with
excellent
retention
i
think
i
can
smell
vanilla
andor
banana
with
some
roasted
malts
taste
is
quite
sweet
at
first
with
the
bananavanilla
side
coming
out
and
then
ends
with
a
more
alcoholic
sweetness
at
the
end
still
cannot
feel
the
alcohol
thought
very
good
probably
the
best
example
of
this
style
that
i
know
of
pours
with
a
thin
head
as
it
warms
the
aroma
pours
out
and
it
is
a
sweet
and
supple
aroma
the
taste
is
clean
and
tangy
medium
body
with
hints
of
caramel
it
is
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
quite
drinkable
the
sweet
notes
make
it
a
great
doppelbock
no
overbearing
alcohol
taste
to
speak
of
very
well
done
i
usually
consider
myself
to
be
a
bit
tough
on
reviewing
highly
recommended
beers
but
this
one
is
worthy
of
the
hype
go
buy
a
bottle
today
drink
it
and
save
the
goat
figurine
so
that
when
you
look
at
it
you
can
remember
your
first
celebration
in
summary
top
of
the
line
doppelbock
all
the
way
i
like
doppelbocks
and
this
is
a
fine
example
you
have
to
love
the
goat
toy
trinkets
around
the
neck
of
the
bottles
i
should
find
some
use
for
them
as
my
collection
is
growing
quite
large
this
pours
of
a
pitchblack
color
with
a
tall
bubbly
beige
head
that
leaved
sheets
of
lacing
around
the
glass
that
stick
for
a
while
very
full
and
complex
aroma
is
rising
from
the
glass
with
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
mixing
around
with
a
strong
ripe
dark
fruit
scent
the
taste
starts
of
with
a
roasted
smoky
flavor
that
is
back
by
fruits
caramel
and
chocolate
behind
that
is
a
touch
of
coffee
and
a
slightly
bittering
finish
that
completes
this
wonderful
flavor
excellent
mouth
feel
as
this
is
full
creamy
and
smooth
not
too
much
more
can
be
asked
from
a
brew
like
this
very
good
drinkability
as
its
complex
flavor
and
scent
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
to
discover
new
elements
in
it
highly
recommended
to
all
and
hey
if
you
dont
like
it
you
get
a
neat
goat
for
a
parting
gift
practically
black
beer
with
a
nice
beige
cratering
head
smell
is
sweetly
malty
with
a
little
cocoa
and
caramel
almost
like
a
stout
taste
is
absolutely
wonderful
dark
lots
of
malt
nothing
too
overpowering
but
theres
some
carameltoffee
a
little
cocoa
and
a
definite
hop
presence
just
a
little
spiciness
to
lighten
it
up
and
a
little
sharp
astringent
malt
towards
the
finish
great
mouthfeel
smooth
and
creamy
this
glass
is
empty
far
too
quickly
but
ive
docked
drinkability
because
i
think
one
or
two
is
the
limit
even
without
the
slightly
higher
abv
its
just
not
something
that
even
a
lover
of
dark
malty
beers
like
i
am
would
want
to
drink
all
night
it
is
a
good
world
that
has
celebrator
in
it
drinkability
a
wonderful
sipping
beer
take
a
little
in
your
mouth
let
it
sit
on
your
tongue
and
work
its
magic
final
note
i
am
absolutely
wild
about
this
beer
in
fact
im
so
crazy
about
this
beer
that
i
cant
tell
if
im
objective
in
rating
it
its
one
of
the
best
ive
tasted
no
kidding
for
all
the
talk
of
creamyness
and
sweetness
at
its
core
this
is
a
highly
balanced
brew
the
brewers
at
ayinger
are
true
craftsmen
this
is
a
work
of
art
pours
a
deep
burgandy
with
brown
head
that
falls
to
ligth
wisps
of
lace
aroma
is
that
of
sweet
malt
caramel
and
light
raisin
bread
aromas
smells
sweet
and
substantial
tastes
of
sweet
malt
molasses
syrupy
sugars
with
a
hint
of
fruit
tastes
heavy
but
feels
lighter
in
your
mouth
creamy
and
smooth
a
pleasure
to
drink
drinkability
is
very
good
goes
down
quick
and
easy
a
malty
fine
beer
personaly
i
lean
to
the
hoppy
side
of
the
force
but
this
is
one
fine
brew
wyll
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
light
brown
head
the
head
is
large
but
quickly
recedes
but
a
smooth
lace
remains
the
smell
is
that
of
molasses
and
a
bit
of
malt
the
roasted
malt
is
particularly
evident
in
the
taste
i
get
almost
a
chocalate
taste
from
the
residual
sugars
as
great
as
the
taste
is
the
mouthfeel
is
even
more
impressive
this
is
a
very
fullbodied
beer
but
it
is
so
smooth
that
it
goes
down
nice
and
easy
the
creaminess
is
overwhelming
this
is
in
my
book
a
top
ten
beer
and
its
reputation
is
completely
deserved
drinkability
a
solid
beer
which
hides
its
alcohol
beneath
great
malt
characteristics
super
smooth
nice
looking
1
inch
fluffy
cream
head
and
a
beautiful
dark
black
body
aroma
is
sweet
with
heavy
malt
presence
the
taste
is
pretty
sweet
and
the
alcohol
hits
midstream
doesnt
finish
as
crisp
as
i
normally
like
on
bocks
but
nonetheless
very
flavorful
i
know
this
is
in
the
top
ten
paulie
very
dark
almost
opaque
prune
color
with
a
large
tan
head
and
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
roastedmaple
and
caramel
malt
aroma
with
sweet
taste
very
much
mirroring
the
aroma
except
there
was
some
alcohol
warming
presense
as
the
beer
went
down
very
creamy
and
smooth
my
favorite
doppelbock
tasty
but
not
exceptional
or
unique
i
wouldnt
refuse
another
but
i
wouldnt
seek
one
out
either
notes
expensively
enjoyable
beer
notes
my
first
doppelbock
highly
drinkable
great
from
pour
to
last
drop
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
and
after
that
a
little
more
the
smell
ofthis
beer
is
very
strong
to
me
and
the
initial
taste
provided
some
fruit
licorice
and
nutty
flavors
with
a
bite
followed
by
a
strong
alcohol
aftertaste
this
beer
got
more
mellow
as
i
drank
it
this
is
a
big
beer
i
have
only
had
one
or
two
dopplebocks
in
the
last
few
years
so
i
really
dont
know
how
to
intelligently
review
this
every
review
i
have
read
has
stated
that
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
would
agree
a
great
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
though
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
drink
more
than
a
few
in
a
sitting
i
also
had
a
glass
of
it
on
tap
at
tornados
in
san
fran
i
think
this
is
the
top
of
the
ba
top
50
ive
had
not
quite
my
favorite
but
very
worthy
of
a
good
position
in
my
top
50
this
double
bock
is
colored
a
deep
colalike
brown
which
borders
on
a
nearly
opaque
black
its
head
is
thin
yet
consistent
and
with
good
retention
a
thick
maltysweet
aroma
blossoms
from
the
top
reminiscent
of
a
porter
or
stout
however
unlike
a
porter
or
stout
this
beer
has
a
slimmer
body
at
once
refreshing
and
filling
the
taste
hints
at
smoke
and
brazil
nuts
or
is
it
coffee
and
is
in
a
word
deep
as
for
its
drinkability
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
one
or
two
of
these
but
i
find
it
hard
to
picture
someone
putting
down
more
than
a
few
bottles
in
an
evening
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
i
would
definitely
cough
up
the
9
bucks
for
a
4
pack

iti

very

was
expecting
to
really
enjoy
this
as
well
and
while
its
still
pretty
good
i
was
not
blown
away

absolutely
amazing

an
amazing

actually
come
to
like
the
little
goat
toy
even
with
the
fact
that
it
was
heavy
as
a
ton
of
bricks
it
was
quite
tasty
and
refreshing

will
try
to
find

i
had
this
in
a
wide
mouthed
glass
i
highly
recommend
this
type
of
glass
to
fully
appreciate
the
aroma
and
bouquet
can
you
say
that
about
a
beer
seriously
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
out
of
this
world
taste
is
top
notch
i
love
this
beer
and
cant
believe
i
havent
tried
it
before
i
guess
i
was
afraid
of
a
dark
german
beer
dont
fear
the
doppelbock
hmm
i
dont
think
i
was
as
bowled
over
as
some
by
this
one
but
it
certainly
wasnt
awful
or
anything
had
at
anam
cara
served
in
lovely

glass
pour
was
opaque
dark

i
found
the
aroma
to
come
across
as
slightly
roasted

slightly
plumey
taste
is
a
bit
lean
and
smooth
i
thought
mostly
of
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
alcohol

around
i
will
have
to
try
this
again

ultrasmooth

complex
very
drinkable
not
really
like
any
other

i
have
had
less

that
little
smokiness
a
classic

some
nutty
fruit
aroma
coming
to
the
front
malt
overpowers
this
brew
with
sharp
and
strong
coffee
and
fruit
taste
the
finish
is
much
smoother
with
some
smoky
toastiness
i
really
liked
tasted
almost
completely
flat
and
on
the
tongue
no
carbonation
but
intense
flavor
kept
thinness
away
and

the

2
on
a
business
trip
to
seattle
i
discovered
celebrator
on
draught
at
the
pike
pub
and
brewery
needless
to
say
i
stumbled
home
after
that
poured
out
of
the
12
oz
bottle
with
a
cool
little
goat
pendant
hanging
on
the
neck
into
a
16
oz
goblet
dark
brown
opaque
dense
body
with
ruby
red
highlights
when
held
up
against
the
light
nice
two
inch
tall
khaki
colored
head
formed
after
pouring
but
soon
dissipated
to
a
thin
soapy
ring
of
bubbles
lacing
around
the
glass
is
relatively
moderate
aroma
was
that
of
plums
raisins
and
hazelnuts
taste
was
vinous
and
fruity
with
notes
of
sweet
molasses
caramel
dark
fruits
roasted
nuts
and
spices
there
were
also
some
burnt
smoky
flavors
evident
creamy
mouthfeel
is
smooth
like
satin
the
aftertaste
was
dry
and
the
only
place
where
the
hops
stepped

tennessee
drinkability
nice
drinkable
beer
could
certainly
pound
a
few
of
these
back
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
being
not
as
strong
as
some
of
the
other
doppels
it
doesnt
give
you
that
boozy
aftertaste
nor
does
it
have
you
drunk
insanely
fast
drinkability
very
much
so
not
too
over
the
top
but
does
a
few
things
well
personally
i
think
its
a
bit
overrated
on
the
whole
but
earns
high
marks
in
a
few
areas
this
thoroughly
pleasing
and
complex
brew
necessitates
several
tastings
to
really
grasp
all
of
the
nuances
which
it
cloaks
the
aromas
alone
seem
to
multiply
with
every
smell
the
next
time
i
see
this
beer
i
will
buy
more
than
the
four
i
bought
in
lake
placid
id
love
to
compare
this
with
maximator
anybody
know
where
i
can
get
a
couple
of
them
in
n
colorado
celebrator
pours
a
very
deep
redmahogany
body
with
a
billowing
tanoff
white
head
after
popping
the
cap
the
smell
immeadiately
takes
over
sweet
and
rich
it
speaks
of
raisins
and
prunes
fermented
sugars
and
alcohols
combine
with
malted
notes
to
give
this
an
incredibly
appealing
and
complex
nose
the
taste
is
on
quite
the
same
level
sweet
and
very
smooth
not
nearly
as
viscous
as
you
might
expect
again
prunes
raisins
nuts
molasses
and
light
choco
taste
there
is
a
flavor
very
much
like
candied
yams
a
sort
of
carmelized
burnt
fermented
sugar
taste
that
makes
this
oh
so
delicious
to
sip
a
really
unique
aftertaste
of
earth
sugar
smoke
and
nuts
cashews
or
something
its
sort
of
tough
to
describe
this
is
really
good
stuff
the
mouth
is
balanced
to
perfection
light
enough
to
be
easily
drank
but
heavy
enough
to
hold
the
intense
flavors
drinkability
is
also
top
notch
as
this
is
good
enough
to
warrant
having
another
quite
a
special
beer
and
the
pinnacle
of
dopplebocks
imo
plus
it
comes
with
a
fun
plastic
goat
trinket
whee
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
beer
is
just
served
well
in
a
bottle
its
a
good
beer
but
on
darught
this
beer
is
probably
as
good
as
it
gets
this
is
not
an
easy
beer
to
appreciate
my
palate
still
needs
some
education
for
such
a
hardcore
brew
but
you
can
tell
its
a
great
and
complex
beer
alcohol
comes
through
on
aroma
and
taste
lovely
chocolate
brown
color
foam
root
beer
aftertaste
easy
on
mouth
even
with
some
initial
bitterness
mild
roast
overwhelmed
by
malt
sweetness
hint
of
nuts
and
chocolate
and
pinch
of
fruit
and
spices
great
again
in
march
2005
super
excellent
drinkability
a
pleasure
to
sip
anytime
the
first
sip
was
dominated
by
the
delicious
malt
flavor
it
has
an
almost
chocolatelike
taste
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
molasses
with
only
a
very
moderate
carbonation
it
goes
gown
extremely
smooth
and
has
a
dry
creamy
finish
to
it
without
a
doubt
this
is
the
best
doppelbock
that
i
have
had
immeasurably
enjoyablethis
beer
is
a
true
classic
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
the
style
for
sure
when
the
mood
hits
me
shirley
ill
be
back
sweet
dreams
its
no
wonder
why
this
beer
is
so
highly
rated
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
full
just
like
a
bock
should
be
while
maintaining
smoothness
and
the
drinkability
on
this
is
also
great
this
beer
takes
the
flavors
that
i
really
like
in
porters
and
stouts
and
somehow
turns
it
into
something
i
find
highly
drinkable
this
would
work
equally
as
well
for
me
sitting
at
a
bar
having
a
few
and
chatting
it
up
or
sitting
here
savoring
and
chilling
not
to
disrespect
the
beer
but
i
could
imagine
it
going
great
with
traditional
beer
food
pizza
wings
appetizers
etc
this
beer
and
style
has
acquired
a
new
fan
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
drinking
experience
awaits
those
who
are
willing
to
try
it
this
is
the
best
of
a
very
barleyed
world
at
least
for
me
this
evening
a
muscular
assertion
of
malt
with
blissfully
understated
malt
sweetness
the
various
aspects
of
the
malt
flavors
give
it
a
full
and
impressive
image
the
mutiple
levels
keep
it
interesting
at
the
risk
of
sounding
sexist
this
is
a
manly
beer
leathery
and
earthen
with
body
and
confidence
to
spare
just
one
could
never
be
enough
and
a
few
or
even
more
could
never
be
boring
each
one
is
something
to
look
forward
to
get
it
if
you
see
it
11
2
oz
bottle
poured
a
deep
dark
mahogany
with
a
massive
head
that
stuck
around
lots
of
lacing
left
behind
when
the
head
finally
receded
aroma
is
slightly
malty
and
spicy
but
not
overly
so
making
me
think
that
the
taste
would
be
muted
also
however
the
taste
is
exceptional
very
malty
thick
and
chewy
with
a
creamy
smooth
feeling
as
it
goes
down
i
could
drink
these
all
night
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
i
didnt
want
the
bottle
end
another
plus
to
the
beer
is
that
it
comes
with
a
little
plastic
ram
outstanding
big
foamy
head
when
poured
but
no
lacing
very
dark
with
maybe
a
hint
of
red
if
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
a
little
flat
so
the
mouthfeel
is
not
as
good
but
it
has
a
great
flavor
for
some
reason
it
has
always
reminded
me
of
those
root
beer
candies
that
are
shaped
like
a
mini
keg
this
is
a
good
beer
but
when
you
break
it
down
into
these
categories
it
seems
like
the
ranking
is
lower
than
it
should
be
maybe
its
a
case
of
the
whole
is
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
the
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
eventually
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
is
full
of
black
and
roasted
malts
very
malty
it
has
a
creamy
scent
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
nuts
the
taste
is
also
great
it
goes
down
smooth
with
a
dry
yet
creamy
finish
it
has
chocolately
roasted
nut
flavor
that
is
very
nice
this
is
the
best
doppelbock
ive
ever
had
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
very
well
it
has
tremendous
flavor
simply
a
fine
beer
this
is
one
that
i
will
buy
again
taste
is
very
malty
and
nutty
i
mean
its
everywhere
on
the
palate
rich
sticky
and
chewy
big
bodied
beer
and
really
really
tasty
if
you
have
ever
had
another
dopplebock
increase
all
the
flavors
by
equal
amounts
25
and
this
is
what
you
will
come
up
with
smooth
but
a
real
sipping
brew
for
me
not
for
sessions
the
king
of
dopplebocks
feel
is
so
outstanding
for
a
heavy
dark
lager
from
the
tap
this
pours
a
very
deep
dark
brown
ruby
red
color
wonderful
offwhite
head
great
thing
about
it
was
that
it
is
being
served
to
me
in
proper
glass
smells
of
dark
bread
tastes
like
a
very
dark
roasted
almost
burnt
malt
however
it
is
so
smooth
how
can
this
be
looking
at
it
you
would
expect
bitter
and
harsh
but
this
is
not
true
good
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
it
really
isnt
my
style
i
can
and
will
respect
this
for
what
it
is
a
great
dopplebock
i
couldnt
drink
many
of
these
but
if
it
is
on
tap
i
am
compelled
to
have
one
if
nothing
else
than
for
the
glass
truly
a
legendary
beer
this
is
easily
one
of
my
favorites
and
its
always
a
treat
to
drink
my
tastebuds
scream
for
mercy
after
one
so
i
cant
take
too
many
not
to
mention
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
through
the
smoothness
i
prefer
the
tap
version
a
little
more
but
its
rather
difficult
to
find
definitely
a
winner
any
way
you
can
get
it
pours
with
a
simply
massive
foamy
tan
head
the
head
lasts
and
lasts
and
lasts
too
a
nice
little
bonus
body
is
a
nice
brown
colour
with
hints
of
amber
smells
of
berries
cherry
and
grape
perhaps
and
malt
throughout
almost
a
bit
of
a
sour
not
badsmell
here
with
hints
of
licorice
and
perhaps
carrots
whatever
it
is
it
smells
good
but
a
tad
off
taste
is
a
creamier
version
of
the
smell
full
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
touch
of
caramel
added
with
malt
all
over
the
place
the
problem
is
while
the
flavour
is
nice
i
cant
escape
that
cooked
carrotslightly
off
characteristic
that
was
in
the
smell
its
here
in
the
taste
as
well
and
hinders
what
could
be
an
awesome
brew
still
very
good
and
drinkable
but
i
prefer
something
more
along
the
lines
of
the
sa
double
bock
which
whilst
not
as
complex
or
bold
as
the
celebrator
i
think
its
a
better
balanced
brew
youve
got
to
try
the
celebrator
at
least
once
and
it
is
definitely
worth
your
while
and
cash
but
while
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
ive
had
doppelbocks
i
enjoy
more
than
this
one
i
finally
get
a
shot
at
trying
a
real
german
dopplebock
no
head
stuck
around
to
evaluate
but
the
wonderful
chocolate
color
was
a
beautiful
sight
in
itself
and
as
it
turned
out
it
matched
the
beer
as
well
aroma
was
light
and
all
malt
with
notes
of
chocolate
the
taste
was
initially
a
smooth
nutty
buscuit
that
finishes
with
strong
chocolate
overtones
its
the
same
kind
of
chocolaty
taste
you
get
from
anchor
porter
except
this
one
was
more
like
having
a
piece
of
dark
chocolate
cake
in
a
glass
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
rich
and
in
fact
it
was
so
rich
and
thick
i
would
not
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
so
much
i
gave
it
good
drinkability
marks
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
if
i
can
find
it
again
it
is
hard
to
find
as
ive
been
looking
for
this
for
a
long
time
and
i
finally
came
across
it
about
400
miles
from
home
if
this
one
is
readily
available
to
you
consider
yourself
lucky
this
was
my
first
experience
with
a
doppelbock
and
i
chose
a
good
one
it
tasted
like
an
extremely
malted
porter
or
stout
ill
be
exploring
this
style
further
poured
from
a
330

bottle
claiming
it
contains
the
finest
bavarian
double
bock
beer
dark
bitter
chocolate
almost
black
color
it
provides
a
good
head
and
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
really
something
special
the
aroma
of
chocolate
is
detectable
as
well
as
a
very
malty
smell
this
is
a
thick
beer
but
not
overpowering
it
is
not
highly
carbonated
and
goes
down
smooth
the
flavors
of
chocolate
and
coffee
are
evident
despite
its
thick
body

this
was

it

a

ups

and
the
taste
is
even
more
complex
flavors
are
numerous
but
wellbalanced
while
this
is
a
characteristically
heavy
beer
i
found
myself
saying
one
more
drink
over
and
over
just
to
decode
what
is
so
wonderful
about
it
to
date
this
is
my
single
favorite
beer
one
more
drink
without
a
doubt
celebrator
doppelbock
is
one
of
the
finest
beers
in
the
world
this
beer
is
almost
better
then
sex
almost
very
dark
beer
in
fact
if
you
just
saw
it
sitting
in
the
glass
youd
probably
mistake
it
for
a
porter
as
light
only
gets
through
around
the
edges
when
it
does
it
gives
a
nice
red
wine
color
the
head
is
a
thick
lumpy
foam
thats
a
medium
tan
color
unfortunately
mine
seemed
a
bit
skunky
but
i
could
pick
up
some
good
malt
aromas
with
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
the
aroma
was
big
but
not
as
big
as
the
appearance
would
suggest
caramel
bitterness
from
the
darkcolored
malts
and
some
fruitiness
i
cant
place
my
finger
on
this
was
all
followed
up
by
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
i
also
picked
up
a
little
black
pepper
but
it
was
faint
enough
im
not
sure
if
i
was
just
tasting
things
okay
i
am
a
fan
of
dark
beers
and
i
have
to
agree
with
alot
of
other
people
that
this
is
the
best
doppelbock
out
there
it
has
a
wonderful
dark
color
and
lovely
aroma
to
it
the
body
is
great
and
the
taste
is
wonderful
deep
ruby
hue
and
very
clear
the
tan
head
is
thick
and
well
retained
the
rich
malt
aroma
is
comprised
of
sweet
buttery
toffee
nutty
peanut
brittle
vanilla
notes
and
mild
toasty
dark
munich
malt
the
malt
profile
is
luscious
heavily
caramelized
sugars
are
combined
w
roasted
grain
notes
that
are
above
the
norm
for
style
its
lighter
in
body
than
spatens
or
paulaners
but
the
depth
of
malt
character
surpasses
either
of
those
theres
more
roasted
grain
and
chocolate
flavors
in
this
brew
and
less
residual
sweetness
the
hop
bitterness
although
subdued
complements
the
light
roasted
grain
bitterness
to
balance
the
malt
sweetness
it
finishes
surprisingly
dry
and
roasty
for
a
doppelbock
celebrator
is
delicious
flavorful
yet
highly
drinkable
great
caramel
and
toasted
malt
aroma
with
the
complex
fruitiness
of
roasted
malt
in
the
middle
and
a
faintly
smoky
dryness
in
the
finish

in
a

meats

this
is

uncommonly

make
this

have

them
as

didnt

the
taste
lived

i
have

nice
toffee

very

with
bitterness
of
roasted

nice
smooth
feel
almost
creamy
and
full
everything
i
hoped
it
would
be
i
thought
it
fuller
and
more
balanced
not
as
syrupy
than
the
salvator
dopplebock
the
last
shot

bittnerness
at
the
end
wanted
you
to
have
another
taste
to

perfection
i

6
of

and
i
think
i
will
keep
the
next
6
for
a

occasion
a
very
good
beer
but
overpriced
i
would
rather
have
a
sa
anyday
particularly
when
considering
the
cost
taste
is
good
but
a
little
lighter
than
i
expected
note
that
i
said
lighter
than
expected
this
beer
does
have
some
depth
and
complexity
but
the
body
is
not
as
heavy
as
i
expected
either
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
great
brew
great
tastes

yeasty
flavor
some
breadiness
no
hops
detected
but
there
must
be
some
to

i
adjusted
to

very
nice
dark
brown
w
a
copper
hue
pours
a
very
small
but
very
creamy
head
it
has
very
little
carbonation
the
aroma
is
that
of
prunes
mixed
with
caramel
and
dough
the
same
can
be
tasted
on
the
palate
this
brew
was
so
easy
to
drink
and
was
so
enjoyable
so
perfectly
balanced
and
fullbodied
an
outstanding
doppelbock
much
like
salvatore
and
maximator
very
similar
superb
hot
diggity
this
stormylooking
brew
lurks
under
a
healthy
dark
tan
head
with
the
first
sip
the
malts
explode
across
the
tongue
robust
but
actually
quite
sweet
featuring
a
rich
buttery
toffee
overcoat
with
caramel
and
hints
of
anise
despite
its
syrupy
consistency
the
mouthfeel
is
trademark
ayinger
soft
cushiony
and
begging
to
be
sipped
this
expertly
balanced
beer
is
truly
a
pleasure
to
get
lost
in
although
perhaps
too
thick
and
sticky
for
true
indulgence
makes
optimator
seem
like
a
light
beer
no
mean
feat
70
nice
bottle
with
a
little
plastic
ram
on
a
string
around
the
neck
pours
to
a
beautiful
black
with
a
thick
lacy
head
smells
like
warm
grains
almost
toasty
with
some
alcoholic
notes
the
taste
is
very
smooth
with
an
excellent
grain
character
hints
of
caramel
and
just
enough
bitterness
in
the
background
to
clean
up
the
sweet
malt
this
is
an
excellent
beer
compared
to
optimator
and
salvator
celerbrator
doppelbock
is
much
more
mellow
soothing
to
the
touch
and
relaxing
to
drink
truely
exceptional
i
sought
this
out
due
to
its
superlative
reviews
on
the
site
and
wasnt
disappointed
chewy
is
an
adjective
that
always
escaped
me
but
this
beer
brought
the
sensation
home
not
as
sweet
as
i
imagined
it
would
be
but
perfectly
balanced
and
fullbodied
had
this
on
tap
and
cant
wait
for
the
next
one
the
most
wonderful
smelling
beer
ive
ever
had
smooth
creamy
huge
malt
profile
with
chocolatecaramelfruitywoody
undertones
tastes
absolutely
spectacular
and
warms
all
the
way
down
words
cant
explain
what
my
senses
are
experiencing
its
fabulous
cant
think
of
anything
i
dont
like
about
this
one
simply
the
best
dopplebock
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
quaff
gotta
love
those
little
plastic
goat
thingys
used
to
have
a
collection
of
them
why
i
dunno
reccomended
stuff
huge
chocolate
and
dark
roasted
malt
flavor
outstanding
beer
an
excellent
beer
but
a
little
bit
overhyped
i
think
i
slightly
prefer
spaten
optimator
but
thats
just
me
the
classic
example
of
the
style
to
which
all
others
should
aspire
robust
and
powerful
without
being
overpowering
i
am
not
at
all
religious
but
i
think
i
might
have
found
religion
in
this
bottle
of
celebrator
doppelbock
that
i
am
drinking
complex
delicious
and
worthy
of
its
following
great
balance
of
dark
malts
and
hops
and
a
nice
thick
frothy
head
with
great
retention
yeah
i
liked
this
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
i
thought
i
would
somewhat
watery
for
a
dopplebock
i
thought
nice
earthy
and
hoppy
flavor
up
in
the
middle
however
no
real
hint
of
the
alcohol
and
not
a
whole
lot
of
nose
this
came
recommended
from
the
bartender
but
i
just
wasnt
that
impressed
had
some
nutty
and
woodlike
notes
but
overall
just
not
a
lot
of
flavor
nothing
else
really
bad
about
it
the
taste
that
was
there
was
good
osmooth
hoperator
is
a
very
unique
brew
a
hoppy
doppelbock
is
a
neat
idea
decently
entertaining
label
as
well
o
looks
fantastic
mouthfeel
is
pretty
great
as
well
smell
falls
a
bit
short
and
i
could
use
a
bigger
hop
presence
but
its
pretty
darn
tasty
well
executed
doppelbock
with
an
american
hoppy
touch
nevertheless
malt
still
predominates
here
as
it
should
o
not
bad
for
a
hoppy
doppelbock
has
some
decent
hop
character
but
its
still
overpowered
by
malt
it
could
use
a
bit
more
balance
the
name
is
the
best
part
of
the
beer
overall
heck
its
worth
a
try
but
for
me
thats
all
it
will
be
it
is
not
bad
per
say
just
dont
think
everything
needs
to
be
hopped
it
is
just
wrong
o
had
no
idea
what
the
style
was
and
was
expecting
a
big
hop
bomb
this
was
a
really
nice
complex
and
malty
beer
this
one
was
definitely
a
sipper
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
o
i
can
see
why
this
one
is
so
highly
rated
cheers
this
is
has
a
nice
hoppy
flavor
which
is
odd
for
a
double
bock
i
enjoyed
this
one
alot
it
is
vey
smooth
usuallly
i
find
double
bocks
tough
on
the
palate
but
not
this
one
it
has
the
carmel
taste
along
with
the
hops
i
know
its
been
around
for
years
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
saw
it
on
tap
in
my
area
overall
interesting
fusion
a
hoppy
doppelbock
but
i
am
not
sold
on
this
one
i
was
excited
after
the
pour
then
lost
some
interest
during
the
aroma
phase
and
it
was
all
downhill
from
there
unfortunately
for
my
taste
this
is
a
dopplebock
that
is
unsure
of
its
own
identity
the
yeasty
kick
seems
more
trapist
inspired
rather
than
what
one
would
typically
imagine
from
a
quality
german
dopplebock
such
as
ayinger
while
worth
a
try
for
those
that
appreciate
belgian
yeastiness
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
makes
me
appreciate
splitting
six
packs
with
friends
so
i
dont
have
to
look
at
5
more
bottles
for
the
next
year
o
the
aroma
is
such
a
tease
considering
the
rest
of
the
beers
characteristics
are
closer
to
mediocre
by
the
way
they
totally
missed
the
chance
to
call
this
hoppelbock
that
would
be
a
better
name
since
the
hops
in
this
are
anything
but
smooth
grabbed
this
one
blind
expecting
an
ipa
didnt
quite
realize
that
the
slickass
dude
on
the
cover
was
actually
a
dudegoat
smooth
hoperator
pours
an
amberbrown
color
with
three
fingers
of
very
well
retaining
head
the
aroma
is
very
rich
with
caramel
malts
but
theres
plenty
of
citrus
and
pine
hops
hanging
out
on
the
nose
too
the
taste
is
excellent
the
malts
rule
the
show
at
first
with
some
caramel
and
toasted
malts
up
front
but
the
finish
belongs
to
the
citrus
and
pine
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
dopplebock
and
the
light
carbonation
is
spoton
overall
smooth
hoperator
is
a
robust
beer
that
should
appeal
to
fans
of
maltier
ipas
and
dopplebocks
alike
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
with
huge
cream
colored
head
settles
slowly
into
a
meringuelike
cap
with
thick
clumps
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
floral
with
spicy
grassy
and
sweet
citrus
notes
sweet
slightly
grainy
taste
quite
sweet
caramel
sweet
apple
earthy
nectarine
herbal
with
a
little
orange
citrus
hoppy
finish
but
oddly
drying
and
tannic
miss
but
if
i
was
going
to
drink
a
ton
of
doppelbocks
i
might
throw
one
of
these
in
from
time
to
time
for
something
different
overall
a
different
interpretation
of
a
traditional
style
that
didnt
completely
win
me
over
overall
quite
nice
the
beer
has
a
great
flavor
profile
nice
flavor
transitions
as
well
a
good
feel
for
the
style
while
not
what
i
would
consider
a
doppelbock
it
is
a
god
blend
of
doppel
and
ipa
its
very
drinkable
flavorful
and
very
tasty
there
is
a
spice
and
a
tang
in
the
finish
which
is
smooth
and
creamy
this
is
an
interesting
and
tasty
beer
this
one
had
a
nice
amber
color
body
with
a
2
white
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
bit
and
turns
into
a
thin
lace
and
stickyness
along
the
top
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
rich
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
kinda
sweet
up
front
then
a
little
more
bitter
on
the
back
of
tongue
it
has
a
little
hop
presence
not
to
much
though
the
mouth
feel
is
really
nice
rolls
off
the
tonuge
really
good
and
overall
this
is
a
good
doppelbock
specially
after
it
warms
up
a
little
bit
then
the
flavors
really
start
to
come
out
overall
not
sure
if
doppelbock
is
the
right
style
for
this
one
i
dont
have
much
to
say
about
this
one
other
than
where
are
the
hops
in
the
smooth
hoperator
d
drinkable
enough
but
im
not
that
into
it
the
malt
character
is
ok
but
uninspiring
and
the
beer
just
seems
to
be
missing
something
i
liked
this
beer
it
was
quite
good
drinks
smooth
and
sweet
feels
a
bit
thin
and
washed
out
too
but
worthy
of
many
more
o
a
very
interesting
hybrid
style
doppelbock
and
ipa
which
i
really
enjoyed
the
addition
of
the
hops
i
found
this
to
be
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
a
little
too
heavy
to
be
sessionable
in
my
opinion
reddish
amber
and
cloudy
in
body
with
foamy
white
head
that
stays
smells
malty
cinnamon
nutmeg
lemon
skins
wet
grass
and
pine
tastes
of
cinnamon
breadiness
nutty
light
caramel
subtle
grass
grapefruit
nice
spices
the
flavors
are
subtler
than
i
was
expecting
and
thats
a
good
thing
thick
in
body
with
light
carbonation
smooth
and
flavorful
and
filling
overall
its
not
a
doppelbock
its
still
tasty
and
drinkable
id
rate
it
higher
if
i
wasnt
rating
against
the
style
either
way
i
enjoyed
it
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
not
as
much
malt
complexity
shines
through
as
with
a
typical
doppelbock
but
the
hops
keep
flavors
intriguing
definitely
hop
heavy
o
it
sure
lives
up
to
its
name
velvety
smooth
and
very
well
hopped
a
very
nice
example
of
an
americanized
doppelbock
o
true
to
the
name
this
beer
is
extremely
smooth
it
is
definitely
hoppy
but
is
also
balanced
out
with
some
sweet
malts
and
spicy
notes
a
sharp
resiny
twang
runs
through
the
palate
of
this
one
definitely
a
bit
of
earth
in
the
hops
as
well
a
thick
caramel
malt
lends
more
feel
than
flavor
but
there
is
a
faint
sweetness
from
caramel
and
toffee
the
resiny
taste
has
a
tobacco
quality
that
is
strong
taking
over
the
balance
of
this
beer
to
the
point
where
its
close
to
overbearing
not
bad
in
reality
but
it
does
seem
to
overpower
other
flavors
that
are
a
bit
more
subtle
definitely
a
generous
use
of
the
hops
but
a
lack
of
really
great
balance
affects
my
view
on
this
one
worth
a
try
though
to
me
the
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
i
dig
the
smooth
texture
of
this
one
and
the
slight
carbonation
there
is
a
subtle
hop
pinch
finally
here
that
could
have
been
around
in
the
scent
and
taste
but
then
that
wouldnt
be
true
to
style
all
in
all
a
tasty
beverage
but
not
much
more
then
average
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
exciting
overall
a
14
six
pack
is
a
bit
pricey
for
me
but
the
pack
i
did
get
was
great
the
score
is
entirely
dependent
on
how
you
view
the
beer
rated
as
an
ipa
or
similar
this
scores
in
the
4
0
range
as
a
doppelbock
its
pretty
poor
as
a
marriage
it
is
also
poor
thus
i
am
torn
here
final
impression
a
lot
of
the
negatives
in
my
review
of
this
come
from
personal
preference
i
did
not
like
an
overly
hoppy
doppelbock
but
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
beer
of
a
technical
standpoint
i
will
finish
the
sixer
but
next
time
i
will
go
back
to
stoudts
dipa
or
the
fat

tastesweet
toasted

nice

very

very

this
has
to
be
the
single
worst
interpretation
of
a
dopplebock
i
have
ever
had
with
out
any
doubt
just
saw
off
in
the
style
its
laughable
beyond
that
what
every
style
you
want
to
call
its
just
plan
out
boring
and
simple
you
can
drink
it
but
found
myself
truly
not
wanting
to
o
this
is
not
the
first
beer
i
would
point
to
if
someone
were
to
ask
me
what
a
doppelbock
tastes
like
but
its
definitely
one
i
would
point
to
if
they
were
to
ask
me
what
a
good
one
is
curious
different
and
one
of
the
best
bottomfermented
beers
ive
had
though
coming
from
someone
who
loves
ales
take
that
with
a
grain
of
salt
d
drinkability
i
dont
know
how
closely
smooth
hoperator
resembles
a
proper
doppelbock
but
disregarding
styles
altogether
this
is
by
far
the
best
ive
ever
had
to
be
fair
this
is
a
bit
strong
in
the
alcohol
department
amazingly
i
couldnt
taste
it
at
all
and
it
was
only
after
i
downed
the
whole
bottle
that
the
booze
snuck
up
on
me
theres
a
good
tang
to
this
like
in
a
slightly
spicy
wing
sauce
and
just
like
that
the
flavor
of
this
kept
me
coming
back
for
me
as
cheesy
as
the
name
of
this
beer
may
be
this
certainly
lived
up
to
its
name
and
hopheads
should
certainly
seek
this
out
almost
red
alelike
in
its
hoppiness
this
will
probably
be
a
beer
that
i
reach
for
time
and
time
again
a
good
smooth
easy
drinking
effort
from
stoudts
here
i
liked
this
one
despite
my
overall
score
im
actually
stuck
somewhere
between
a
b
and

called
this

overall
very
unique
flavor
profile
not
the
best
tasting
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
drink
it
again
d
very
drinkable
the
addition
of
the
hops
on
top
of
the
doppelbock
style
is
really
interesting
and
different
the
balance
is
also
really
nice
here
the
cpj
overall
i
didnt
mind
this
but
this
is
one
strange
doppelbock
but
its
very
easy
drinking
for
the
high
abv
i
must
say
prost
big
thanks
goes
out
to
a74gent
for
sending
me
this
one
as
an
extra
in
a
recent
trade
after
seeing
it
on
my
wants
served
from
bottle
into
a
grolsch
pilsner
poured
a
deep
redorange
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
oranges
and
citrus
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
citrus
citrus
hop
and
grapefruit
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
brew
a
doppelbock
holy
christ
i
was
thinking
this
was
an
iipa
until
i
read
the
style
on
here
very
easy
drinking
despite
the
7
abv
i
could
see
myself
getting
in
trouble
with
this
one
with
large
quantities
very
nicely
balanced
flavor
and
good
aroma
going
on
here
definitely
up
there
when
it
comes
to
favorites
of
this
particular
style
o
an
excellent
brew
but
i
expect
nothing
less
from
stoudts
i
shoulda
picked
up
more
than
one
bottle
of
this
ill
have
to
grab
a
few
more
and
put
one
aside
to
see
what
its
like
down
the
road
as
well
smooth
like
the
name
suggests
and
not
bitter
like
i
was
expecting
for
completeness
it
is
just
as
good
out
of
the
bottle
prost
overall
quite
a
nice
doppel
overall
a
very
nice
brew
hope
to
be
able
to
partake
of
this
one
again
d
very
easy
to
drink
for
sure
fairly
drinkable
while
it
has
a
hoppy
smell
theres
not
much
hop
to
the
taste
still
a
nice
tasting
beer
id
gladly
have
again
d
solid
level
of
drinkability
and
this
is
where
i
think
this
shines
could
definitely
enjoy
several
of
these
session
style
without
getting
tired
of
the
flavor
a
big
six
pack
recommendation
smooth
hoppy
with
a
dry
toasted
malting
all
coming
together
in
a
very
drinkable
package
tasty
and
toasty
warm
quality
though
i
think
this
drinks
closer
to
a
american
amber
then
a
dopplebock
d
i
finally
got
to
try
smooth
hoperator
and
i
was
rewarded
a
great
experiment
from
stoudts
and
i
see
why
they
made
this
a
seasonal
nice
hop
presence
for
the
hop
heads
with
just
enough
malt
to
please
other
beer
drinkers
if
i
didnt
read
it
here
i
would
not
have
identified
the
style
im
not
sure
what
i
would
call
it
experimental
i
guess
if
they
are
calling
it
a
doppelbock
it
must
be
bottom
fermented
its
pretty
light
colored
but
the
combo
of
yeast
loads
of
hops
etc
isnt
really
working
for
me
i
will
not
buy
this
again
but
it
is
something
everyone
should
try
once
it
feels
like
a
dopplebock
when
you
drink
this
but
it
sure
as
every
doesnt
have
the
normal
dark
malty
tastes
to
it
very
nice
balance
though
of
roastness
and
hopness
if
dfh
aprihop
and
boulder
beer
cold
hop
had
a
baby
it
would
be
stoudts
smooth
hoperator
i
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
one
doppelbock
purists
may
not
appreciate
this
one
simply
bc
its
not
true
to
style
but
its
a
tasty
beer
recommended
sure
this
may
be
an
unconventional
dopplebock
what
with
the
hops
all
but
its
really
darn
tasty
i
got
a
kick
out
of
how
the
flavor
profile
progressed
as
the
beer
warmed
shifting
toward
maltiness
totally
off
my
radar
now
totally
recommended
overall
very
surprised
by
this
beer
id
pick
up
a
6pack
if
we
had
stoudts
around
here
d
scarily
drinkable
if
you
want
more
hops
in
a
dopplebock
this
is
your
beer
i
would
defnitely
buy
this
again
ive
been
waiting
to
sample
this
beer
for
a
long
time
and
i
must
say
it
lived
up
to
my
expectations
im
more
of
a
hoppy
ale
type
of
guy
as
apposed
a
thick
malty
lager
type
of
guy
so
this
twist
on
the
style
works
in
my
favor
stoudts
is
an
underrated
brewery
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
their
best
one
of
the
more
creative
beers
that
ive
had
in
a
while
it
is
totally
out
of
style
though
due
to
excessive
hoppiness
it
will
loose
points
for
that
but
it
still
a
good
beer
that
i
would
have
again
im
not
really
sure
what
to
make
of
this
offering
an
insanely
hoppy
doppelbock
points
deducted
for
such
a
deviation
from
the
style
but
good
flavors
nonetheless
very
unique
drinkability
ml
might
not
like
this
dopplebock
because
its
a
bit
hoppy
for
the
style
but
i
sure
appreciated
it
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
beige
head
above
the
clear
coppery
brown
brew
head
recedes
slowly
with
coating
lacing
aroma
is
thick
earthy
pine
taste
begins
with
a
peek
of
sweetness
which
quickly
gives
way
to
the
pine
bitterness
which
dominates
the
experience
citrus
makes
a
guest
appearance
but
pine
is
the
game
here
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
easy
once
the
hops
wear
your
resistance
down
a
bit
nice
offering
hard
to
rate
this
one
if
rating
by
category
it
kinda
misses
the
mark
this
is
heavier
in
the
ipa
range
but
structurally
it
is
doppelbock
a
tasty
brew
that
is
what
its
creators
intended
it
to
be
a
hybrid
worth
the
try
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
2
at
a
time
d
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
like
a
hybrid
of
a
dopplebock
and
an
ipa
drinkability
a
distinctively
american
take
on
the
doppelbock
style
and
well
worth
seeking
out
again
strays
from
the
style
for
a
bock
of
any
kind
but
very
enjoyable
hoppy
with
support
from
malt
that
doesnt
get
sickeningly
sweet
like
some
hoppy
ales
very
mellow
surprisingly
drinkable
dark
brown
in
color
great
malty
aroma
a
little
low
on
carbonation
but
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
clocking
in
at
7
abv
this
beer
still
remains
dangerously
sessionable
if
you
dont
mind
getting
a
solid
buzz
after
three
or
four
i
was
slightly
disappointed
that
there
wasnt
more
doppelbock
character
to
it
though
its
a
lager
it
tastes
more
like
an
ipa
eh
goes
down
ok
semicomplex
flavors
meld
with
the
alcohol
well
but
the
flavors
just
dont
mesh
too
well
kind
of
an
odd
pairing
that
misses
its
mark
just
a
bit
for
me
f
some
bitterness
but
seems
to
ebb
a
little
lingering
hop
resins
though
with
that
musty
taste
not
going
away
and
a
little
astringent
the
sweet
sticky
flavor
is
also
present
on
the
finish
but
the
dark
wheat
flavors
seem
to
fade
and
this
turns
more
to
a
dipa
than
what
it
really
is
d
well
since
this
is
a
limited
release
i
may
have
to
grab
up
one
more
before
its
gone
i
couldnt
see
a
best
to
drink
by
anything
on
the
bottle
itself
but
the
label
really
is
a
cool
one
glad
the
goodl
beer
matched
the
awesome
label
had
i
waited
till
32410
to
crack
this
i
am
pretty
sure
it
would
have
been
just
as
tasty
of
a
beer
poured
a
clean
amber
nice
head
overall
very
inviting
the
smell
and
mouthfeel
were
dominated
by
caramel
malts
that
finished
throughout
the
beer
this
is
a
strong
malty
beer
so
if
your
into
those
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
big
fan
thanks
to
one
of
my
east
coast
traders
for
this
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
poured
a
clear
deep
amber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
slowly
goes
into
a
film
with
very
good
lacing
hops
dominate
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
malts
hops
hit
you
right
away
with
pine
and
citrus
and
again
in
the
bitter
finish
in
between
you
get
a
sweet
caramel
and
biscuty
flavor
this
brew
surprised
me
was
hopful
for
a
good
dopplebock
which
i
like
and
got
a
mouth
full
of
hops
poured
a
deep
copper
color
with
excellent
clarity
small
head
with
a
little
lacing
strong
nose
from
fresh
german
hops
backed
by
a
bready
malt
aroma
has
a
sweet
taste
of
caramel
and
honey
with
a
suprisingly
milder
than
expected
hop
flavor
finishes
quite
bitter
for
a
dopplebock
though
mouthfeel
is
a
little
slick
for
style
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
what
i
like
in
a
dopplebock
i
wanted
to
give
this
a
4
5
in
taste
based
on
my
own
preferences
but
docked
it
that
5
in
an
effort
to
score
to
style
pretty
hoppy
compared
to
other
dopplebocks
ive
had
not
as
much
of
a
malt
presence
but
it
should
be
made
clear
i
love
this
beer
drinkability
not
bad
for
a
beer
with
the
body
of
a
double
bock
still
rather
tough
to
go
through
more
than
a
couple
of
these
drinkability
very
easy
sipper
for
a
dopplebock
an
interesting
beer
by
stoudts
that
is
worthy
of
another
purchase
in
the
future
drinkability
i
thought
this
was
a
pale
and
certainly
not
a
doppelbock
so
does
that
take
points
off
im
not
sure
but
i
dont
think
so
certainly
the
hoppiest
version
of
the
style
ive
had
but
i
like
the
risk
and
the
differences
pay
off
her
nice
carbonation
and
feels
light
bodied
for
a
doppelbock
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into

bock

toasted

caramel

maybe
a
notch

two
better
than

with
ample

for
the
style
worth
checking
out
a
bit
different
than
your
ordinary
doppelbocks
d
this
is
a
nice
dopplebock
i
didnt
even
know
that
it

25
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
beverage
warehouse
winooski
vt
drinkability
is
good
probably
better
than
a
classic
dopplebock
it
is
lighter
and
crisper
than
some
very
tasty
and
worthy
of
more
than
one
12
oz
bottle
a
true
hybrid
at
least
from
what
my
own
tongue
says
not
sure
how
the
brewer
actually
describesclassifies
this
all
i
know
is
it
gets
an
a
for
originality
although
its
just
a
step
or
two
away
from
blowing
my
mind
its
complex
bordering
on
confusing
but
it
avoids
being
a
mess
kudos
to
stoudts
for
the
ingenuity
that
went
into
this
one
drinkability
the
brewery
points
out
that
this
is
an
american
style
doppelbock
which
means
the
malts
are
what
youd
expect
but
that
american
hops
have
been
used
instead
of
the
noble
hops
found
in
most
doppelbocks
i
personally
find
this
very
interesting
and
drinkable
and
a
nice
variation
on
the
classic
style
i
could
easily
have
another
and
another
after
that
i
will
definitely
return
to
this
beer
if
only
because
i
like
it
regardless
of
whether
it
fits
to
style
or
not
it
actually
seems
to
me
to
be
the
doppelbock
that
would
be
brewed
in
europe
if
originators
of
the
style
had
had
american
hops
rather
than
noble
hops
to
work
with
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
bodied
and
a
bit
thin
with
good
carbonation
easy
drinker
pours
a
dirty
orange
brown
color
with
a
large
orangebrown
head
big
booming
aromatic
hops
in
the
nose
lots
of
pine
and
bitter
fruit
a
very
balanced
beer
i
was
actually
unaware
of
the
style
before
searching
to
review
doppelbock
really
i
could
have
swore
dipa
to
be
honest
either
way
lots
of
rich
caramel
malts
play
nicely
with
the
absurd
amount
of
fresh
peppery
hops
dumped
into
this
thing
very
nice
indeed
wish
they
distributed
this
one
do
they
distribute
this
one
this
beer
should
be
called
enigma
this
might
be
more
of
an
apa
to
me
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
from
a
bottle
this
is
an
awesome
beer
ps
i
did
get
a
slight
burning
sensation
on
my
tounge
from
this
its
lasted
about
12
hrs
so
far
havent
figured
that
out
yet
drinkability
a
good
beer
but
not
overly
complex
a
satisfying
malty
and
hoppy
beverage
worth
consuming
in
mass
quantities
salud
its
great
to
see
stoudts
down
here
in
nc
poured
a
lighter
bronze
color
with
a
tight
one
finger
white
head
that
great
lasting
power
sticking
like
glue
to
the
glass
as
it
settled
very
slowly
wow
what
a
hop
presence
for
a
doppelbockvery
citric
in
the
nose
mixed
with
some
caramel
sweetness
and
some
toasted
malt
a
little
prickly
in
the
mouth
but
not
to
annoying
a
hefty
dose
of
citric
hop
flavors
with
some
tropical
fruitlikeness
as
welltoasty
in
the
finish
with
a
light
sourness
as
well
hmm
interesting
to
say
the
leastbeing
a
hophead
i
love
the
hop
profile
albeit
it
seems
outta
place
a
little
meh
the
abvs
a
bit
high
and
tastewise
this
isnt
for
me
drinkability
most
drinkable
doppelbock
ive
enjoyed
an
ipa
lovers
doppelbock
very
tasty
i
highly
recommend
this
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
one
of
the
best
beers
from
a
brewery
that
has
been
on
my
radar
for
quite
a
while
i
could
drink
a
bit
of
this
it
is
delicious
kind
of
funny
i
picked
this
beer
to
be
my
random
six
pack
for
the
weekend
considering
i
strongly
dislike
bocks
and
doppelbocks
i
looked
it
up
on
here
and
thought
oh
well
looks
like
this
one
will
be
going
to
my
dad
after
i
try
one
turns
it
it
tastes
like
a
delicious
double
ipa
i
dont
see
how
this
is
in
the
bock
category
at
all
definitely
a
huge
hop
presence
maybe
a
bit
more
maltier
than
the
average
ipadipa
out
there
but
this
one
is
a
nice
bitter
brew
that
goes
down
easy
just
disregard
the
style
it
tastes
like
a
dipa
drinkability
is
where
ill
let
the
beer
have
it
smooth
hoperator
is
a
stupid
name
for
this
beer
if
theres
a
pun
worth
associating
with
this
beer
it
should
involve
malt
instead
of
hop
its
not
tough
to
drink
but
it
aint
smooth
either
this
might
be
my
first
stoudts
review
and
i
know
fans
abound
but
ive
yet
to
encounter
something
worth
remembering
excellent
brew
its
not
hot
its
well
balanced
and
is
very
nice
to
look
at
alot
of
deep
rich
colors
hmm
im
not
sure
how
to
rate
this
one
on
one
hand
its
too
hoppy
to
be
a
doppelbock
on
another
hand
its
good
i
like
it
wow
tough
choice
it
drinks
very
well
but
i
just
cant
rate
it
as
a
doppelbock
i
blame
it
on
the
celebrator
and
other
doppelbocks
ive
had
perhaps
its
a
classification
mistake
hmm
d
ive
never
had
a
doppelbock
like
this
one
im
almost
wondering
if
it
was
the
bottle
that
was
off
either
way
toning
down
the
dried
fruit
just
a
notch
would
definitely
make
me
like
this
one
a
bit
more
single
from
grape
gourmet
virginia
beach
va
extra
in
a
trade
from
treyrab
thanks
for
the
chance
to
try
this
pours
as
a
nice
burnished
copper
with
a
fairly
light
head
and
some
scant
lacing
smells
very
malty
and
buttery
with
some
noticeable
diacetyl
finishes
somewhat
nutty
and
with
a
bit
of
soy
aroma
the
taste
is
malty
and
firm
and
thankfully
the
soy
and
diacetyl
have
disappeared
very
dry
and
with
a
light
taste
of
baked
apples
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
bready
and
smooth
and
overall
this
drinks
pretty
well
not
bad
but
not
my
first
choicee
for
a
doppelbock
the
appearance
is
a
lightmedium
amber
tone
with
a
one
finger
head
that
does
not
sit
there
for
too
long
the
smell
is
not
as
strong
as
some
other
doppelbocks
i
have
tried
smells
of
fruit
and
some
hops
the
taste
is
richer
though
a
taste
that
would
nicely
compliment
a
burger
and
fries
mf
is
hoppy
spicy
with
an
aftertaste
that
yearns
for
some
water
stoudts
continues
on
its
streak
in
my
book
with
solid
brew
after
solid
brew
d
this
is
a
very
tough
beer
to
judge
on
one
hand
its
a
brilliant
beer
on
the
other
hand
i
find
this
to
be
a
poor
representation
of
the
doppelbock
style
looks
like
a
doppelbock
but
smells
tastes
and
feels
more
like
an
american
ipa
its
really
an
american
ipa
stuck
in
a
doppelbocks
body
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
hard
not
to
truly
relish
in
this
brewing
craftsmanship
the
texture
as
the
name
may
suggest
is
quite
smooth
body
is
probably
a
little
heavier
than
medium
with
appropriate
carbonation
i
really
like
this
one
dr
very
very
easy
to
drink
gone
before
you
know
it
or
want
it
to
be
notes
strange
beer
and
a
strange
taste
really
all
i
can
say
is
it
is
worth
the
try
and
not
much
else
because
this
is
really
a
weird
beer
i
can
not
say
i
liked
it
so
i
will
notyet
it
did
intrigue
me
d
very
drinkable
its
one
of
those
drinks
that
you
have
finished
before
you
realize
it
if
this
brew
was
easily
available
i
would
drink
it
often
nicely
done
stoudts
overall
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
it
isnt
nearly
as
good
as
stoudts
other
offerings
and
it
is
quite
a
ways
off
base
for
the
style
i
wont
be
buying
another
one
d
in
my
opinion
this
is
beer
with
mixed
results
it
has
its
solid
attributes
but
it
comes
down
to
the
taste
and
thats
just
not
that
interesting
12oz
bottle
the
headkeeper
this
one
poured
a
fairly
clear
copper
color
there
was
a
small
white
head
on
it
that
left
some
lacing
the
aroma
was
good
lots
of
hops
up
front
with
this
one
mainly
with
pine
and
some
floral
notes
a
fair
amount
of
caramel
malt
also
the
taste
was
also
very
good
there
were
enough
hops
to
make
you
think
ipa
but
a
lot
of
malt
and
dark
fruits
that
you
get
in
a
doppelbock
definitely
worth
having
again
overall
absolutely
fantastic
tasting
beer
and
what
a
great
marriage
of
hops
and
malt
could
easily
envision
drinking
this
all
night
but
the
7
abv
may
tell
me
otherwise
pretty
good
mouth
feel
but
way
too
sweet
for
my
likings
12
oz
bottle
served
in
a
regular
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
1
finger
head
there
is
great
lacing
with
this
beer
as
well
as
head
retention
i
could
not
get
much
out
of
the
aroma
with
this
one
i
could
only
pick
up
hops
and
malt
perhaps
this
is
due
to
the
glass
that
i
used
the
taste
is
predominately
hop
oriented
the
first
sip
there
is
a
pinch
of
malts
and
then
it
is
all
hops
the
carbonation
is
fine
and
the
beer
goes
down
very
smooth
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
one
that
might
improve
with
a
little
more
balance
try
some
its
a
cross
between
a
bock
and
and
ipa
picked
up
one
bottle
of
this
at
bruisin
ales
thinking
it
was
an
ipa
oh
well
i
certainly
do
like
doppelbocks
as
well
and
if
its
as
hoppy
as
sierra
nevadas
debockle
ill
be
happy
12oz
bottle
into
a
corsendonk
tulip
a
crisp
dark
copper
with
a
decent
eggshell
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
great
lacing
aroma
is
a
nice
balance
of
crisp
sweet
malt
and
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
certainly
loads
of
hops
in
nice
balance
with
crisp
malts
still
possessing
that
expected
bock
bite
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
and
fairly
well
hidden
alcohol
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
more
interesting
doppelbocks
ive
ever
had
the
drink
is
medium
in
body
with
fine
carbonation
and
is
really
pretty
darned
quaffable
as
the
encounter
comes
to
an
end
i
glance
back
at
the
supercool
labelgoat
hes
still
pointing
but
now
i
get
it
no
need
to
ask
the
smooth
hoperator
wants
you
to
drink
his
brew
definitely
not
a
beer
for
purist
doppelbock
fans
but
much
more
to
my
personal
liking
ipbock
extremely
easy
to
drink
no
sense
of
alcohol
content
pretty
damn
good
but
why
waste
that
wonderful
name
on
anything
but
an
ipa
d
a
pleasant
beer
that
you
could
easily
have
more
than
one
as
its
not
heavy
and
lack
an
alcohol
after
taste
despite
its
7
0
abv
m
slightly
thinner
than
medium
bodied
hophead
or
not
try
it
you
will
like
it
overall
this
definitely
was
a
very
hoppy
doppelbock
to
me
the
doppel
characteristics
took
a
back
seat
to
the
big
hoppy
flavor
of
this
beer
worth
trying
pours
out
a
clear
deep
amber
color
with
a
massive
offwhite
head
theres
a
bit
of
lacing
and
very
good
retention
wish
it
were
just
a
bit
darker
but
otherwise
very
nice
the
smell
is
mainly
noble
hops
maybe
just
a
bit
of
american
in
there
or
maybe
im
just
thinking
of
the
american
approach
when
i
smell
it
something
new
but
not
what
i
hope
for
in
a
doppelbock
not
even
a
whiff
of
dark
sweet
chewy
malts
the
taste
is
about
the
same
a
sharp
spicy
minty
hoppiness
not
a
lot
of
bitterness
maybe
it
was
sucked
up
by
the
malt
but
i
cant
really
taste
it
either
with
some
effort
i
can
taste
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
no
chewy
bready
maltiness
i
like
the
feeling
of
the
noble
hops
but
a
doppelbock
theres
no
doppelbock
feeling
here
this
is
more
like
an
alt
and
a
strong
one
at
that
it
still
drinks
kind
of
smoothly
with
almost
no
notice
of
the
7
abv
it
doesnt
hit
the
doppelbock
spot
but
i
enjoyed
it
dont
expect
anything
and
youll
probably
enjoy
it
really
a
cool
and
interesting
idea
and
id
reccmmend
it
for
those
interested
even
a
nice
farmhouse
cheddar
with
earthy
grassy
tones
would
be
nice
as
this
brew
has
a
certain
earthy
characteristic
overall
pretty
easy
to
drink
the
flavors
are
not
overpowering
but
still
prevalent
a
little
sweeter
than
i
like
but
there
is
just
enough
hop
bitterness
to
help
balance
it
out
m
d
somewhat
chewy
body
carbonation
makes
itself
known
somewhere
over
the
middle
of
the
tongue
giving
it
a
sparkling
sensation
rather
than
a
stickiness
almost
too
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
smoothness
that
makes
it
all
that
much
more
pleasant
recommended
drinking
d
highly
drinkable
given
the
unusual
nature
of
this
brew
at
7
its
alcohol
is
well
tolerated
because
of
the
flavors
and
the
character
of
this
beer
not
a
typical
dopplebock
by
any
means
reminds
me
more
of
an
hopped
up
amberred
overall
this
a
very
good
beer
however
i
would
have
never
guessed
it
is
a
doppelbock
i
could
not
really
find
any
malt
in
it
and
thought
that
is
was
more
of
an
ipa
either
way
i
enjoyed
it
pours
out
a
ruby
reddish
gold
with
nice
big
white
head
that
laces
well
really
hoppy
for
a
dopplebock
in
the
nose
very
floral
tinge
of
citrus
and
a
splash
of
some
sweet
roasted
caramel
malts
tastes
starts
out
with
a
nice
sweet
malt
bocky
taste
but
is
rudely
interrupted
by
a
hops
explosion
of
bitter
citrus
and
piney
nature
very
nicely
done
it
is
like
no
other
doppelbock
ive
had
but
when
its
done
like
this
its
a
great
pleasure
very
smooth
drinking
beer
with
the
nice
balance
achieved
with
this
one
must
try
again
d
at
7
abv
its
strong
but
not
too
strong
this
beer
can
stick
with
you
for
some
time
poured
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
rich
red
color
with
a
three
finger
tan
head
rising
and
lingering
for
awhile
the
smell
was
a
bit
sweet
hops
and
a
strong
alcohal
aroma
the
first
flavors
that
hit
my
toung
was
sweet
malt
and
sweet
alcohal
then
thay
are
washed
away
to
smooth
hop
bitterness
that
almost
stings
your
toung
and
you
can
still
taste
minits
later
this
is
a
great
beer
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
grey
lodge
it
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
moderate
white
head
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
full
of
hops
a
heavy
amount
of
citrus
the
beer
is
labeled
as
a
doppelbock
but
it
taste
like
an
ipa
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
citrus
there
is
a
malty
backbone
but
it
is
dominated
by
hops
the
beer
is
a
lightmedium
bodied
quaffer
i
liked
this
beer
and
graded
it
as
if
it
were
an
ipa
imo
this
is
not
a
doppelbock
but
it
is
a
good
brew
this
is
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
its
hot
a
lot
more
hops
flavorsmell
then
your
typical
doppelbock
but
still
has
most
of
the
main
doppelbock
characteristics
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
dark
copper
pour
head
is
intense
at
first
but
diminishes
quickly
really
thought
this
guy
was
an
ipa
from
the
name
but
i
was
delightfully
surprised
a
nice
hoppy
lager
for
sure
i
smell
grapefruit
and
citrus
quite
strange
for
a
doppelbock
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
sticky
i
still
am
having
a
hard
time
classifying
this
beer
tastes
so
much
like
an
ipa
very
smooth
velvety
for
a
lager
certainly
glad
i
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
beer
ive
been
dying
to
try
it
due
to
the
name
love
it
great
beer
share
it
with
others
drinkability
dang
this
is
easy
to
drink
plenty
of
flavour
great
body
reasonable
abv
for
the
style
a
very
good
drinker
indeed
oh
and
head
retention
is
great
as
is
the
lacing
i
enjoyed
every
ounce
of
this
brew
and
was
craving
more
well
done
stoudts
i
know
i
didnt
go
into
the
specifics
of
the
beer
like
i
normally
do
but
if
you
want
that
read
the
other
reviews
i
just
felt
like
summarizing
my
tasting
experience
and
now
im
going
to
get
back
to
my
wonderful
beer
cheers
i
could
have
a
few
more
of
these
with
out
hesitation
great
beer
i
really
hope
i
can
find
more
of
this
stuff
a
great
twist
on
a
doppelbock
and
one
that
everyone
should
try
great
one
to
give
to
your
hop
head
friends
taste
is
very
flavorful
all
of
the
aromatics
can
be
found
on
the
palate
hops
mango
peach
pears
grapefruit
pine
and
hints
of
toasted
malts
as
well
not
sure
it
fits
the
category
but
very
interesting
and
very
enjoyable
d
very
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
nice
representation
of
style
with
an
extra
burst
of
hops
that
you
dont
too
often
in
the
style
this
is
a
good
flavorful
beer
with
substance
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
very
long
time
this
one
leans
a
little
towards
a
maibock
in
terms
of
color
and
taste
not
the
best
by
traditional
standards
but
it
is
still
very
good
as
it
plays
with
the
style
guidelines
a
little
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
overall
an
interesting
and
hop
driven
dopplebock
d
a
little
heavy
on
the
hops
for
me
but
interesting
nonetheless
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
but
wouldnt
turn
a
free
one
down
d
id
say
pretty
highly
drinkable
could
definitely
drink
a
couple
a
nice
hoppy
beer
that
hop
heads
who
arent
into
doppelbocks
can
enjoy
drinkability
as
you
can
tell
from
the
score
i
gave
this
beer
i
now
have
a
new
favorite
stoudts
beer
smooth
hoperator
was
nothing
short
of
being
a
great
easy
drinking
hoppy
lager
i
would
have
no
problems
drinking
this
winner
again
if
youre
thinking
this
is
going
to
be
a
take
on
a
traditional
german
doppelbock
think
again
overall
a
great
beer
by
stoudts
it
really
smashes
out
of
the
doppelbock
mold
while
certainly
holding
on
to
the
essence
of
the
style
very
solid
beer
and
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
this
is
an
outstanding
hoppy
beer
for
those
who
are
into
bitter
hoppy
brews
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
though
this
is
more
balanced
and
easier
drinking
than
others
in
its
class
overall
this
is
a
great
showing
buy
stoudts
probably
the
best
beer
i
have
had
by
them
and
definitely
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
now
i
feel
better
by
previous
review
was
not
fair
a
really
unique
take
on
a
doppelbock
that
is
packed
with
a
ton
of
hops
and
drinks
a
lot
easier
than
that
style
would
dictate
tasty
and
refreshing
stoudts
has
a
winner
with
this
one
six
12oz
bottles
for
12
from
bauer
wines
in
boston
purchased
midjune
2008
with
a
midaugust
expiry
date
seems
rather
short
especially
since
its
a
new
offering
at
the
store
which
appears
to
go
through
stock
pretty
quickly
pours
a
dark
copper
red
clear
with
a
big
head
nice
malty
aroma
with
a
good
deal
of
hops
first
taste
is
well
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
medium
bodied
decent
hops
in
the
aftertaste
lacing
up
the
yinyang
adding
to
this
rating
with
a
later
bottle
and
the
more
i
have
the
more
i
like
a
beer
has
to
be
pretty
good
to
have
a
label
that
bad
this
offering
from
stoudts
pours
a
deep
mahogeny
leaving
a
thick
tan
head
that
is
frothy
and
clings
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
nutty
sweet
caramel
bready
citrus
hops
crisp
clean
nose
the
taste
starts
tart
very
crisp
dry
upfront
the
flavor
then
moves
to
suttle
sweetness
of
caramel
bready
earthy
aroma
notes
at
around
7
the
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
the
finish
leaves
you
smacking
your
lips
tartness
bitter
hops
not
as
smooth
and
malty
as
i
would
expect
from
a
doppelbock
but
nice
enough
to
enjoy
a
few
d
not
as
smooth
as
the
label
would
lead
you
to
believe
but
still
a
great
brew
recommend
to
hopheads
may
catch
doppelbock
drinkers
off
guard
dtop
notch
i
really
like
this
one
and
will
look
out
for
it
definitely
one
smooth
beer
though
my
only
complaint
is
it
could
have
a
little
more
hop
wallop
however
if
the
name
wasnt
hoperator
i
would
not
complain
stoudts
is
great
nuff
said
mouth
is
good
and
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
a
clear
amber
with
a
big
offwhite
head
and
great
lacing
i
enjoy
a
beautifully
bright
lemony
sweet
grapefruit
hops
aroma
the
flavor
offers
a
crisp
citrus
hops
over
a
bready
malt
foundation
very
pleasant
fairly
light
and
very
drinkable
uniquely
flavorful
with
tart
hops
but
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
d
very
good
goes
down
easy
and
yet
has
some
flavor
to
it
worth
checking
out
pours
a
very
nice
golden
copper
color
nice
carbonation
very
nice
onefinger
plus
creamy
offwhite
head
lots
of
nice
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
hoppy
slightly
malty
citruspines
and
caramel
the
taste
is
hoppy
mostly
with
some
malt
notes
nice
citruspines
with
nice
caramel
tones
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
not
a
doppelbock
this
is
a
very
tasty
ipa
all
the
way
highly
recommended
overall
this
was
definitely
a
keeper
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
lately
and
definitely
a
winner
in
my
book
very
well
balanced
not
sure
about
the
style
classification
but
still
very
good
indeed
i
would
have
no
issues
with
picking
up
a
good
bit
of
this
one
down
the
road
full
and
even
mouthfeel
creamy
and
rich
but
finishes
a
bit
crisp
good
beer
very
driinkable
stoudts
developed
a
really
interesting
beer
with
this
one
the
hop
flavor
really
is
the
surprising
component
that
propels
it
to
very
good
status
given
the
name
its
not
a
huge
surprise
but
somehow
it
manages
to
be
when
you
taste
it
its
just
hard
to
imagine
the
flavor
combo
that
smacks
you
in
the
face
i
havent
had
a
beer
quite
like
this
one
in
any
event
it
works
check
it
out
the
aroma
invites
sweetness
there
is
initial
caramel
sweet
followed
up
immediately
by
all
ipalevel
hops
big
malty
head
a
good
bitterness
amarillo
and
summit
hops
a
bit
of
toasted
malt
smooth
drinking
with
suitable
carbonation
fresh
and
satisfying
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
i
could
easily
enjoy
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
seating
but
it
is
a
bit
too
high
in
abv
to
be
sessionable
quality
brew
overall
that
is
well
worth
trying
both
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
excellent
slightly
carbonated
with
alot
of
amber
flavor
i
really
like
this
beer
and
at
7
cant
session
it
too
much
but
i
will
try
to
get
more
of
this
in
the
future
as
add
in
to
trades
very
good
and
recommended
drinks
great
just
not
a
dopple
maybe
if
dopples
came
outta
san
diego
or
kent
theyd
be
like
this
good
beer
off
style
though
would
score
higher
as
an
aipa
to
me
nice
dark
amber
with
golden
orange
outlines
big
sticky
super
pillowy
long
lasting
off
white
head
fresh
grassy
piney
and
citrus
hints
with
sweet
toasty
malts
in
the
nose
very
slight
hint
of
alcohol
comes
into
play
as
well
intense
hops
sting
with
some
pine
floral
and
grassy
hit
while
having
a
super
smooth
sweet
carmelled
malt
flavor
that
actually
clashes
in
a
very
enjoyable
way
with
hop
flavors
the
malt
and
hop
profile
seem
to
take
turns
tugging
on
you
senses
and
it
makes
for
a
unique
enjoyable
experiance
feel
on
the
mouth
is
wonderfull
and
its
easily
drinkable
watery
mouthfeel
with
a
little
carbonation
good
to
try
but
i
wont
buy
another
even
the
head
brewer
of
stoudts
says
it
reminds
him
of
an
ipa
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
certainly
the
most
hopped
up
doppelbock
i
have
ever
tasted
the
big
flavors
may
not
meld
as
well
as
i
would
like
but
i
enjoyed
it
nonetheless
mild
even
empty
flavor
at
first
but
the
hops
kick
in
right
before
the
swallow
they
are
there
for
the
after
taste
but
mellow
quickly
its
not
as
thick
as
it
appeared
smooth
like
the
name
says
and
very
drinkable
simple
but
full
flavors
grab
this
one
ifwhile
you
can
bright
and
crisp
with
a
medium
body
and
a
mildly
bready
hop
aftertaste
that
really
contributes
to
the
overall
mouthfeel
for
me
light
and
very
fine
yet
substantial
carbonation
a
great
collaboration
of
of
bready
caramel
malt
and
big
hops
md
medium
to
full
bodied
and
very
easy
drinking
might
not
be
very
true
to
style
but
a
very
drinkable
doppel
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
dark
copper
colored
with
a
thick
head
leving
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
really
hoppy
this
doesnt
smell
like
a
doppelbock
at
all
i
expected
hops
based
on
the
name
but
still
this
was
nice
the
taste
is
unique
a
very
good
mix
of
hops
into
doppelbock
malts
the
hops
wins
the
fight
hands
down
nice
beer
from
stoudts
the
flavor
is
up
front
and
robust
very
hoppy
and
quite
earthy
the
malt
sweetness
was
present
but
not
the
focus
if
anything
it
enhanced
the
musty
herbal
tinge
of
the
hops
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
mediumfull
overall
this
is
an
ambitious
brew
that
may
be
a
bit
too
green
nice
unique
effort
though
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
ruby
and
amber
tint
nose
is
niiiice
nice
hoppy
red
character
me
like
flavor
is
hoppy
and
like
a
red
ale
as
well
nice
robust
tones
that
stay
constant
feel
has
a
good
carbonation
and
nice
liquid
feel
this
is
damn
drinkable
a
very
well
made
brew
must
try
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
harp
pint
glass
label
on
this
bottle
is
classic
i
recently
started
saving
labels
and
the
smooth
hoperator
and
peche
mortel
are
by
far
my
favorites
firm
pour
results
in
two
finger
rocky
head
moderate
lacing
light
brown
in
color
with
a
nice
rocky
off
white
head
smell
is
citrus
and
floral
hops
with
a
pungent
malt
backbone
taste
is
slightly
complicated
citrus
hops
initially
on
the
palate
followed
by
a
nice
malt
body
that
may
be
considered
a
bit
thin
finishes
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
a
very
nice
beer
that
can
be
a
bit
cloying
as
it
warms
marked
down
slightly
on
drinkability
make
of
it
what
you
will
an
intruiging
beer
for
sure
whats
a
style
anyway
surely
interesting
experience
quite
a
nice
brew
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
i
guess
the
7
would
catch
up
with
me
but
i
wouldnt
taste
it
coming
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
update
got
a
fresh
bottle
much
better
nose
much
hoppier
really
nice
and
different
beer
d
its
interesting
and
kind
of
wish
id
picked
up
a
whole
6er
instead
of
just
a
bottle
to
try
its
not
your
traditional
example
of
the
style
but
who
cares
when
it
tastes
this
good
both
hoppy
and
malty
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
shows
the
creativity
of
american
craft
brewing
welldone
d
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
taste
very
flavorful
all
of
the
aromatics
can
be
found
on
the
palate
hops
mango
peach
pears
grapefruit
pine
and
hints
of
toasted
malts
as
well
not
sure
it
fits
the
category
but
very
interesting
and
very
enjoyable
d
easy
drinking
and
keeps
you
interested
recommended
easy
enough
to
drink
but
not
my
favorite
style
hopheads
will
enjoy
this
it
has
a
wonderful
bitter
flavor
thanks
to
muenchenerkindl
for
this
one
it
pours
a
clear
deep
amber
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
fluffy
and
recedes
very
slowly
into
a
lot
of
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
very
hoppy
for
a
doppelbock
or
any
other
beer
for
that
matter
grapefruit
grass
clippings
with
hints
of
caramel
and
toffee
underneath
the
taste
is
a
little
maltier
than
the
aroma
but
is
still
dominated
by
hops
caramel
leads
the
way
but
is
soon
cut
in
half
by
the
sharp
hop
edge
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
for
what
the
brewer
intended
it
to
be
a
wiser
ba
than
myself
once
said
i
can
tell
you
if
a
beer
is
high
quality
and
i
can
tell
you
if
i
like
it
but
the
answer
isnt
always
the
same
i
can
tell
you
that
this
is
a
high
quality
beer
but
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
hoppy
doppelbocks
still
props
to
the
brewer
for
stretching
the
definition
of
beer
this
beer
is
very
good
and
quite
unique
it
is
certainly
a
hybrid
of
sorts
that
does
blaze
its
own
path
the
beer
pours
a
copper
color
amber
with
some
retaining
head
and
lacing
there
isnt
much
carbonation
which
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
doppelbock
or
octoberfest
in
the
beer
the
smell
is
very
pungent
floral
estery
hops
the
smell
is
amazing
the
pine
scents
just
last
and
last
it
truly
is
an
amazing
aroma
that
is
unlike
most
hopped
up
ales
the
taste
is
ipa
in
part
with
the
estery
somewhat
oily
and
chewy
hop
bite
and
grapefruity
puckerishness
but
there
is
a
doppelbock
element
to
the
beer
in
that
there
are
caramelly
amberish
malts
a
medium
body
some
sweet
almondy
flavors
and
a
slight
flatness
in
terms
of
carbonation
the
malty
sweetness
blends
so
well
with
the
estery
hop
bite
that
the
beer
is
incredibly
unique
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
oily
the
hops
linger
but
dont
overpower
this
beer
is
well
worth
seeking
out
great
brew
if
i
lived
closer
it
would
defiantly
be
a
go
to
brew
for
me
highly
drinkable
great
brew
with
a
style
thats
difficult
to
define
i
wouldnt
immediately
think
dopplebock
when
its
served
but
i
wouldnt
necessarily
think
dipa
either
ill
just
call
it
a
tasty
brew
for
my
money
stoudts
smooth
hoperator
deserves
to
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
as
the
outstanding
fat
dog
imperial
oatmeal
stout
kudos
to
the
brewery
for
giving
us
beer
geeks
something
new
and
different
not
to
mention
hoppy
and
delicious
this
is
an
awesome
beer
plain
and
simple
try
to
fit
it
tightly
into
a
style
description
like
doppelbock
as
its
listed
and
youre
going
to
be
disappointed
but
drink
it
for
what
it
is
an
awesome
unique
beer
and
you
cant
possibly
be
im
very
happy
that
i
had
a
chance
to
drink
a
couple
or
more
of
these
in
their
run
very
drinkable
tasty
enjoyable
brew
d
this
is
an
unusual
offering
that
really
doesnt
fit
any
category
i
cant
believe
it
took
me
so
long
to
try
this
d
oh
boy
i
could
go
for
another
the
same
grassy
herbal
piney
flavors
the
smell
indicated
great
hops
and
bitterness
on
the
finish
a
bit
of
dopplebock
shows
through
but
most
is
masked
with
the
hop
floral
on
the
finish
with
a
bready
malt
character
mouth
is
very
thin
on
draught
compared
to
what
ive
had
in
bottle
otherwise
a
fine
drinker
wow
what
an
outstanding
beer
this
is
i
was
even
hesitant
to
try
it
pours
a
nice
oft
brown
color
lacing
all
the
way
down
glad
i
let
it
warm
up
before
tasting
rich
floral
hoppy
aromas
on
the
nose
almost
ipa
like
the
taste
is
even
better
smooth
crisp
malty
yet
hoppy
as
well
but
not
too
much
the
hops
do
not
linger
dont
know
if
this
is
a
dopplebock
really
whatever
the
style
it
is
unique
and
well
worth
a
good
try
d
very
drinkable
really
nice
smooth
and
goes
down
great
with
the
sweet
malt
and
pronounced
hopping
i
would
say
this
is
right
on
for
an
imperial
red
ruby
red
in
color
small
head
gone
fairly
quickly
thin
wispy
lace
strong
grassy
hop
aroma
nice
earthy
hop
flavor
at
first
sip
some
malty
nutty
tones
in
the
aftertaste
nicely
carbonated
good
meduium
mouth
feel
good
drinkability
seems
like
a
nicely
balnced
ipa
except
its
a
lager
not
an
ale
good
stuff
poured
a
clear
deep
copper
red
color
with
a
nice
layer
of
creamy
tan
head
ok
retention
great
lacing
smells
of
citrus
grass
caramel
and
biscuits
taste
is
really
unusual
for
a
doppelbock
lots
of
hoppiness
like
grapefruit
and
fresh
cut
grass
up
front
followed
by
the
sweetness
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
along
with
bread
finishes
with
more
earthy
hops
and
an
ever
so
slight
alcohol
touch
protruding
medium
in
body
good
carbonation
just
as
smooth
as
the
name
suggests
with
a
nice
bitterness
very
easy
to
drink
great
flavors
and
a
good
balance
one
of
my
favorites
from
stoudts
great
drinkability
one
of
the
most
pleasant
surprises
ive
yet
to
come
across
seek
this
out
fast
big
cheers
to
the
brewers
at
stoudts
very
drinkable
im
glad
i
picked
up
case
so
i
can
sit
and
enjoy
a
few
more
over
this
weekend
pours
a
clear
copper
hue
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
light
webbing
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
love
the
smell
of
this
one
oily
pine
and
citrus
hops
with
powerful
caramel
malt
backbone
such
a
unique
combination
but
it
works
so
well
an
interesting
apple
like
aroma
dances
in
the
nose
throughout
as
well
taste
is
unique
as
well
but
in
a
good
way
this
is
a
doppelbock
taste
is
mostly
hops
with
grapefruit
and
slick
pine
coming
through
towards
the
end
is
where
the
malty
flavors
emerge
an
enjoyable
carmel
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
slight
floral
and
lemon
zest
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
medium
body
with
a
subtle
carbonation
goes
down
so
easy
amber
ale
doppelbock
pale
ale
who
the
hell
cares
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
thanks
again
dan
for
hooking
me
up
i
was
quite
surprised
to
see
this
listed
as
a
doppelbock
the
hop
character
is
clearly
the
dominant
note
here
even
to
be
an
american
interpretation
the
malt
really
needs
to
play
a
bigger
role
here
this
is
of
course
my
own
opinion
though
as
this
beer
clearly
shines
as
an
example
that
i
am
wrong
this
really
does
not
work
for
me
even
on
a
purely
hop
driven
level
as
the
garlic
herbal
hop
character
of
summit
hops
is
just
a
bit
too
dominant
to
be
enjoyable
this
is
just
another
beer
that
proves
to
me
how
much
i
really
do
not
like
summit
hops
the
drinkability
is
good
with
a
little
tweaking
in
the
hop
profile
this
brew
could
be
a
monster
prosit
mk
flavor
is
an
intense
dark
hop
blast
very
smooth
with
rich
hops
piney
citrusy
strong
d
i
could
easily
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
in
one
sitting
i
like
dopplebocks
and
i
like
hops
so
this
offering
is
a
match
made
in
heaven
drinkability
yes
please
at
7
it
is
still
a
pleasurable
beverage
i
had
this
at
the
brewery
and
had
to
bring
back
a
6
pack
to
share
with
friends
the
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
mix
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
there
appears
to
be
some
crystal
malt
sweetness
as
well
but
the
hops
really
stand
out
in
this
one
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
powerful
hop
flavor
that
just
blows
you
away
in
the
beginning
then
the
malts
hit
you
in
the
finish
its
got
a
sweet
crystal
malt
taste
as
well
as
a
dry
roasted
malt
flavor
the
hops
create
such
a
bitter
palate
it
resinates
on
your
tongue
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
awesome
beer
im
not
sure
it
follows
typical
doppelbock
guidelines
but
it
really
drinks
well
drinkabilityan
easy
drinking
beer
for
sure
while
this
is
considered
a
dopplebock
i
would
not
classify
it
as
such
regardless
of
what
it
is
stoudts
made
a
nice
brew
with
this
one
drinkability
not
too
bad
for
a
doppelbock
desperately
trying
to
appeal
to
the
hopheads
out
there
d
virtually
perfect
maybe
a
slightly
strong
hop
profile
for
true
maltheads
i
really
enjoy

the

nice

a
half
with
this

stoudts
answered
a
question
ive
been
asking
for
a
long
time
what
would
happen
if
you
took
a
lager
and
just
hopped
this
shit
out
of
it
it
seems
to
work
pretty
well
here
its
even
more
refreshing
than
a
normal
ipa
even
with
all
the
malt
they
put
in
to
make
this
a
doppelbock
this
is
what
you
get
when
hops
meet
bock
truly
an
enjoyable
beer
drinkability
smooth
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
great
beer
from
stoudts
try
this
if
you
see
it
on
tap
d
i
think
this
is
around
7
im
feeling
it
after
2
dangerously
smooth
and
very
nice
indeed
an
experiment
gone
right
id
wondered
for
quite
a
while
why
there
wasnt
a
lager
equivalent
to
the
ipa
well
here
it
is
big
and
hoppy
it
has
a
very
american
citrus
and
perfume
aroma
with
matching
flavor
the
taste
however
adds
a
bit
of
citrus
rind
and
very
smooth
almost
light
caramel
malt
unfortunately
theres
a
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
but
for
the
most
part
the
7
abv
is
well
hidden
its
not
the
lager
version
of
two
hearted
but
its
a
great
beer
cheers
very
tasty
and
very
hoppy
for
a
an
amber
lager
recommended
appearance
is
amber
in
color
crystal
clear
with
a
touch
of
white
head
on
top
and
no
real
lacing
nose
is
mostly
floral
hops
a
touch
of
sweetness
taste
is
solid
and
wellbalanced
lots
of
floral
hops
up
front
and
in
the
pretty
short
aftertaste
with
a
good
amount
of
sweet
malt
in
the
middle
this
one
tastes
like
a
solid
apa
or
mild
ipa
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
actually
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
from
stoudts
too
bad
its
a
onetime
brew
d
very
enjoyable
hopped
beer
that
is
not
filling
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
disapated
quickly
aroma
of
a
sweeter
malt
and
subtle
citrus
hops
in
the
taste
i
would
never
guess
it
is
a
lager
in
tastes
just
like
an
ipa
a
nice
maltly
body
i
really
like
this
beer
i
hope
stoudts
keeps
it
around
for
a
while
im
glad
somebody
decided
to
brew
a
german
style
bock
with
some
american
hops
a
long
overdue
experience
appears
a
ruby
amber
tone
crystal
clear
cast
to
it
with
a
large
tan
head
thick
bubbles
fomrs
large
floating
above
the
glass
like
a
biscuit
aromatics
are
very
nice
with
full
piney
and
floral
hop
bouqets
with
some
leafy
tobacco
and
spicy
character
complemented
by
a
nice
warming
biscuit
caramel
malt
presence
flavor
comes
off
upfront
leafy
herbal
bitterness
piney
hops
really
are
the
highlight
with
some
rolling
blended
caramel
malt
rather
spicy
with
a
biscuit
bready
tone
to
it
finishes
pretty
clean
with
some
hops
sticking
around
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
rather
light
despite
the
large
bubbled
nice
sized
head
flows
even
with
a
slick
oily
finish
drinkability
is
great
an
original
concept
with
more
than
ample
flavor
i
like
what
stoudts
has
done
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
without
a
problem
overallas
i
said
i
reviewed
this
as
a
dopplebock
even
though
it
is
listed
here
on
ba
at
the
time
i
reviewed
as
an
amber
lager
with
that
in
mind
i
dont
believe
it
hits
the
dopplebock
mark
head
on
but
it
one
of
the
best
ive
had
to
date
the
outofstyle
big
hop
presence
really
adds
to
the
style
in
my
mind
which
resides
in
my
hophead
so
having
now
been
to
the
stoudts
website
and
seeing
that
it
is
listed
as
an
american
dopplebock
i
say
hell
yeah
if
americans
can
their
own
ipa
then
why
not
the
dopplebock
awesome
beer
overall
a
disappointing
amber
beer
a
pretty
decent
ipa
overall
a
moderate
american
craft
beer
offering
nothing
that
really
stands
out
about
this
one
i
was
a
little
surprised
by
the
abv
because
this
is
a
really
smooth
beer
pours
a
translucent
amber
with
some
copper
highlights
beige
head
stays
for
about
15
seconds
and
then
forms
a
stickage
ring
around
the
glass
light
toasty
malt
character
with
a
good
dosage
of
leafy
hop
aroma
one
wouldnt
really
expect
this
to
be
a
lager
but
it
is
pretty
clear
from
the
aroma
clean
and
lagerish
smelling
with
a
greater
amount
of
higher
alpha
hops
very
hoppy
tasting
too
bitter
upfront
with
some
tealike
tannins
shining
through
some
residual
sweetness
pulls
through
and
finishing
dry
crisp
and
smooth
a
nice
alternative
to
an
ipa
medium
to
full
bodied
slick
on
the
tongue
with
a
healthy
carbonation
level
a
very
nice
lager
with
hopheads
in
mind
btw
the
dude
on
the
bottle
looks
like
hes
the
spawn
of
joe
camel
and
tubbs
from
miami
vice
winner
in
my
book
nice
hoppy
but
not
too
heavy
body
or
alcohol
could
be
a
troublemaker
though
i
had
no
idea
this
was
7
medium
body
with
a
drying
finish
to
it
makes
me
want
another
one
very
easy
to
drink
and
highly
enjoyable
i
will
have
to
get
some
more
of
this
very
soon
still
amazed
at
what
they
did
to
an
amber
lager
great
job
stoudts
d
the
abv
is
well
hidden
but
can
catch
up
to
you
still
this
hybrid
harvest
maibock
really
hits
the
spot
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
quite
interesting
there
are
very
few
lagers
that
are
hopped
this
aggressively
and
it
pleases
me
that
stoudts
released
this
one
id
recommend
this
one
both
to
hopheads
and
lager
lovers
that
are
looking
for
something
a
bit
different
d
at
7
abv
this
is
not
a
session
beer
but
a
good
quaff
nonetheless
drinkability
smooth
clean
and
drinkable
overall
the
beer
is
an
absolute
winner
and
id
like
to
see
it
mass
produced
im
glad
i
tried
this
but
i
have
had
better
amberred
lager
and
while
it
was
very
hoppy
it
did
live
up
to
its
name
but
the
hops
seemed
kinda
bland
this
is
very
reminiscent
of
some
significantly
more
expensive
ipas
ive
had
so
im
surprised
to
see
it
categorized
as
a
lager
all
in
all
an
excellent
choice
especially
for
the
price
must
try
beer
for
hopheadsenjoyed
this
one
a
lot
will
be
drinking
this
beer
again
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
bitter
from
the
yeast
and
hop
selection
that
carries
mostly
notes
of
herbs
that
collapse
on
the
middle
of
the
tongue
in
a
dry
fashion
after
starting
off
with
a
caramel
sweetness
overall
i
ended
up
taking
a
growler
home
of
this
one
i
liked
it
so
much
beers
like
this
remind
you
that
other
lagers
besides
bocks
can
be
so
complex
and
tastey
if
you
see
it
pretend
stoudts
smooth
hoperator
are
the
only
words
you
can
say
whoa
this
must
be
a
beer
like
no
other
ill
let
everyone
else
pick
out
the
details
this
beer
is
underrated
the
brothers
have
it
right
world
class
the
nose
is
beer
we
spend
hours
coming
up
with
adjectives
and
descriptors
for
all
sorts
of
brews
while
28
just
flat
out
nails
it
it
smells
like
beer
it
tastes
like
beer
sweet
sharp
grain
and
booze
it
packs
of
punch
of
alcohol
that
seems
to
carry
a
tiny
note
of
every
beer
youve
ever
had
its
plenty
thick
on
the
palate
and
more
complex
than
most
german
copper
totes
the
load
this
ones
a
stud
this
beer
had
great
flavor
strong
but
not
bitter
and
easy
to
go
down
would
highly
recommend
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
an
epitome
of
the
style
and
the
high
alcohol
is
so
well
masked
which
is
what
i
love
in
high
gravity
brews
like
this
one
fantastic
job
on
this
one
overall
a
real
interesting
doppel
too
bad
i
couldnt
drink
much
of
it
one
rinse
of
the
bottle
and
found
a
giant
shard
in
the
bottom
o
really
easy
to
drink
which
at
11
abv
is
sort
of
scary
wow
i
thought
this
was
delightful
maybe
some
of
this
is
because
i
had
zero
expectation
or
hype
still
has
a
really
nice
rich
and
hardy
bock
flavor
yet
at
11
it
is
rather
easy
to
drink
if
you
see
this
its
worth
a
pick
up
if
you
see
an
eku
28
grab
1
or
2
it
will
put
you
down
its
a
really
tranquilizing
beer
but
clean
so
no
headaches
or
other
unwanted
side
effects
it
can
be
a
little
pricey
but
worth
every
penny
it
has
so
many
rich
flavors
dark
earthy
fruit
notes
seem
to
push
forward
the
most
but
this
is
not
a
sweet
beer
necessarily
the
flavor
intensifies
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
and
the
last
sip
tends
to
be
divine
in
my
opinion
drink
from
a
chalice
or
even
wine
glass
for
sure
the
color
is
a
decadent
rouge
molasses
good
flavor
for
a
strong
beer
purchased
at
cadoro
in
italy
pours
a
dark
cloudy
amber
with
a
small
fizzy
head
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
fruity
yeast
and
a
bit
of
dark
cherry
essence
mixed
in
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malt
fruity
yeast
maybe
some
toffee
and
a
kind
of
sweet
sherry
alcohol
flavor
and
hops
bitterness
palate
is
full
rich
and
fairly
smooth
body
with
good
carbonation
finish
the
same
as
taste
alcohol
seems
to
be
well
hidden
but
comes
thru
more
as
it
warms
up
overall
seems
a
bit
strong
for
a
doppelbock
not
bad
if
sipped
accordingly
overall
i
would
describe
this
as
a
mean
vicious
interpretation
of
the
style
many
others
are
much
maltier
with
darker
fruit
character
but
this
one
is
menacing
and
will
knock
you
off
balance
with
all
that
being
said
it
is
scary
drinkable
and
a
real
treat

eku

is
a
filtered

you

see
right

it
the
smell
is
rich
with
sweetness
and
caramel
you
pick
up
on
some
grains
in
this

not
a
bad
brew
so
far
the
taste
is
sweet
with
some
grains
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
to
this
brew
but
nothing
over
powering
im
guess
the

kulmbacher
brauerei
ag
did
a
nice
job
with
this
brew
this
brew
is
nicely
balance
with
a
high
high

the
high
abv
is
it
is
not
notable
in
this
brew
goes
down
smooth
and
clean
this
brew
is
better
than
what
i
was
expecting
i
will
get
this
brew
again
i
had
fears
that
it
would
be
a
little
strong
and
overpowering
but
thankfully
this
wasnt
the
case
very
sweet
malty
the
beer
tasted
great
definitely
one
worth
picking
up
it
was
fairly
cheap
as
well
which
always
helps
o
this
beer
was
a
revelation
to
me
all
those
years
ago
when
i
was
still
discovering
new
brews
and
buying
most
of
my
bottles
by
the
intrigue
of
their
label
alone
this
is
a
beer
that
most
certainly
stands
alone
among
all
the
many
beers
ive
tasted
difficult
to
find
a
twin
or
sibling
to
it
samichlaus
its
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
and
still
one
of
my
favorites
very
clear
amber
light
tan
head
dies
down
to
lingering
thin
layer
no
lacing
banana
cloves
aspirin
alcohol
heat
dry
in
the
middle
a
bit
of
cherry
and
wood
in
the
nose
consistent
carbonation
finishes
with
a
bit
of
lingering
bitterness
underneath
the
sweetness
pretty
good
for
the
style
tho
not
one
id
go
to
often
seems
a
second
cousin
when
compared
to
samichlaus
classic
a
serious
attitude
to
the
whole
thing
not
bad
but
a
sipper
for
sure
wow
what
a
treat
this
was
grab
couple
more
this
weekend
if
still
available
at
a
very
reasonable
3
50
per
yesterday
was
an
amazing
lager
day
i
had
this
before
dinner
lager
with
capones
excellent
25
hot
wings
followed
by
a
16
oz
troegenator
you
can
really
taste
the
similarities
in
all
3
beers
differing
with
the
abv
of
course
someday
i
will
have
to
do
these
3
and
a
samichlaus
in
abv
order
going
to
lagertown
after
the
high
ratings
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
one
wow
was
i
disappointed
smell
was
artificial
bananas
and
some
nuts
taste
was
straight
rough
alcohol
not
subtle
at
all
and
there
wasnt
anything
else
there
really
wondering
what
happened
here
kulmbacher
is
now
0
for
2
in
my
book
surprisingly
good
thought
this
would
be
just
a
bad
boozy
beer
but
its
actually
quite
a
treat
excellent
doppelbock
that
is
on
the
sweeter
side
with
a
complex
array
of
flavors
the
alcohol
makes
it
a
sipper
for
sure
perfect
for
an
after
dinner
drink
but
i
found
it
to
pair
quite
well
with
a
salty
german
dish
like
kielbasa
and
sauerkraut
this
has
been
a
shelf
turd
of
the
highest
order
and
now
i
am
frustrated
that
it
has
such
a
dynamic
and
delicious
beer
like
a
german
better
version
of
the
less
harvest
stuff
it
pours
clear
honey
amber
color
dense
looking
but
clean
not
much
head
after
a
few
seconds
the
nose
is
particularly
sweet
like
caramelized
sugars
and
taffy
nutty
too
in
nose
and
taste
as
well
earthy
under
all
that
sweet
malt
and
the
alcohol
content
is
as
well
hidden
as
it
possibly
could
be
what
i
lover
here
is
the
buttery
malt
finish
with
a
hint
of
dry
hay
and
summertime
air
even
though
this
works
exquisitely
in
winter
its
magically
rich
and
filling
dense
body
without
a
much
fizz
but
its
not
missing
it
drinks
like
a
brandy
and
improves
with
temperature
at
under
4
bucks
a
bottle
i
am
amazed
this
is
still
around
pure
market
ignorance
as
far
as
im
concerned
i
will
be
buying
this
frequently
as
long
as
the
weather
stays
cold
o
a
terrific
doppelbock
drinks
more
like
a
bourbon
barrel
ale
would
go
well
with
a
cigar
share
with
friends
o
not
quite
top
tier
but
i
would
buy
this
again
good
stuff
overall
pretty
good
beer
that
is
true
to
the
style
if
you
like
doppelbocks
you
wont
be
disappointed
possibly
would
repurchase
this
i
can
sum
this
up
nicely
with
one
word
wow
this
is
an
incredible
beer
get
it
enjoy
it
i
have
to
remember
not
to
get
this
and
stick
to
the
eisbock
very
malt
dominant
beer
as
it
should
be
with
a
high
alcohol
kick
rich
but
the
toasted
malt
and
hops
keep
it
fairly
in
check
just
a
bit
hot
strong
doppelbock
top
notch
for
an
almost
sub
style
a
must
for
lovers
of
such
low
drinkability
hard
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
if
you
have
something
else
lined
up
for
the
evening
take
it
with
time
and
water
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
please
disregard
those
scores
o
this
is
unlike
any
german
beer
i
have
had
it
has
more
attributes
of
a
belgian
strong
with
out
the
spiciness
its
a
big
big
beer
which
you
dont
see
too
much
of
coming
out
of
that
country
but
it
is
so
well
done
incredible
and
a
total
surprise
to
me
overall
solid
beer
and
quite
the
sipper
especially
out
of
a
mug
i
feel
that
this
beer
would
take
hours
to
drink
and
a
gallon
of
water
but
thats
the
way
the
style
is
intended
to
be
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
but
enjoying
it
a
few
times
a
year
i
didnt
have
expectations
here
but
i
love
it
it
is
sweet
loaded
with
booze
and
i
can
see
myself
drinking
a
jug
of
this
stuff
i
wonder
if
they
serve
this
by
the
jug
in
germany
i
am
sure
they
do
lets
go
find
out
prost
o
a
sweet
boozy
powerful
beer
quite
an
experience
good
to
sip
by
the
fire
not
something
to
drink
a
lot
of
though
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
well
balanced
but
strong
appropriately
carbonated
not
as
sweet
as
i
had
expected
to
my
happiness
but
just
as
malty
as
you
would
expect
beautiful
color
lots
of
little
tiny
bubbles
this
is
high
quality
and
i
havent
got
a
great
deal
of
experience
with
the
style
but
now
im
eager
to
try
some
more
m
an
intense
and
complex
sensation
since
start
alcohol
can
be
easily
detected
sweetness
is
strong
but
not
overwhelming
it
is
a
balanced
sensation
o
as
my
first
eisbock
i
was
unsure
of
if
i
would
enjoy
the
style
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
balanced
this
beer
is
i
was
expecting
a
much
sweeter
alcoholic
tasting
chunckier
brew
i
would
seek
out
this
beer
again

there
taste
is
pretty
spectacular
a
big
smack
of
alcohol
comes
straight
away
followed
by
creamy
caramel
and
fruity
goodness
and
then
finished
with
a
bit
of
spice
from
the
alcohol
again
surprisingly
its
not
out
of
balance
at
all
and
that
alcohol
is
really
nice
and
warming
its
a
beer
to
be
reserved
for
night
caps
and
it
makes
for
a
great
change
of
pace
as
such
big
thanks
goes
out
to
my
doppelganger
for
sharing
this
one
served
from
bottle
into
a
terrapin
mason
jar
poured
redorange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
caramel
hop
and
sweet
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
alcohol
caramel
caramel
hop
and
subtle
fruit
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
this
one
was
definitely
on
the
slightly
boozy
side
if
i
am
honest
however
there
was
enough
other
things
going
on
here
to
help
cover
that
up
slightly
and
balance
it
out
the
mouthfeel
on
this
one
was
spoton
though
and
definitely
helped
with
the
drinkability
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
but
doubt
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
do
so
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
clear
dark
amber
with
a
tall
biege
head
that
dissipates
slowly
plenty
of
tiny
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
lacing
is
not
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
the
head
dissipates
a
wispy
cap
is
left
atop
the
beer
after
the
head
dissipates
the
beer
smells
very
sweet
and
the
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
aroma
as
well
the
aroma
is
slightly
bready
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
bready
sweetness
from
the
malt
and
the
alcohol
heat
does
come
through
in
the
flavor
its
grainy
the
body
is
full
with
little
carbonation
the
finish
is
dry
the
alcohol
content
makes
this
beer
a
sipper
but
it
is
an
easy
sipper
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
for
the
style
one
wants
a
doppelbock
to
be
a
meal
in
a
glass
and
this
satisfies
eku
28
has
won
its
case
as
a
quality
german
doppelbock
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
picking
up
an
entire
case
of
this
sucker
a
few
bottles
to
lay
down
would
be
fine
but
i
dont
think
id
want
to
mess
around
with
24
or
even
12
of
these
bad
boys
to
determine
peaking
age
a
very
sturdy
brew
but
nothing
to
go
allin
on
still
very
deserving
of
my
overall
score
4
0
rjt
o
this
comes
across
as
a
well
crafted
beer
and
the
perfect
winter
warmer
a
great
sipper
to
be
savored
o
this
is
a
pretty
awesome
beer
i
must
say
ive
no
way
of
knowing
if
the
off
flavors
in
the
aroma
are
usual
or
if
its
an
effect
of
travel
but
the
flavor
more
than
makes
up
for
them
rich
and
crisp
all
at
once
sweet
flavors
but
not
overtly
so
phased
plasma
rifle
in
the
40
watt
range
move
over
celebrator
youve
just
been
replaced
as
my
favorite
dopplebock
d
this
has
to
be
the
biggest
doppel
i
have
had
thus
far
love
how
smooth
this
is
on
such
a
big
body
makes
it
very
drinkable
reminds
me
of
an
english
barleywine
without
as
much
complexity
good
beer
worth
grabbing
over
all
this
is
a
nice
sipper
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
i
had
cellared
this
bottle
for
two
years
and
i
may
save
the
last
bottle
i
have
for
another
year
d
pleasantly
surprised
what
eku
28
turned
into
after
coming
to
cellar
temp
doppelbocks
arent
my
favorite
style
but
id
like
to
have
this
one
again
sometime
overall
drinkability
i
recommend
giving
half
a
bottle
a
high
pour
then
intermittedly
pouring
the
rest
as
needed
for
head
pours
a
medium
amber
minimal
head
zero
lacing
very
few
bubbles
smell
is
honey
malt
alcohol
tastes
like
honey
malt
and
alcohol
as
well
being
my
first
doppelbock
maybe
eku
28
was
a
little
heavy
to
start
with
at
11abv
however
it
leaves
behind
a
nice
feeling
in
the
throat
of
alcohol
and
honey
after
a
sip
call
me
crazy
but
this
reminds
me
a
little
of
barenjager
certainly
interesting
and
out
of
the
norm
for
me
not
a
favorite
but
worth
a
try
o
a
tasty
doppelbock
flavors
are
true
though
the
color
is
a
bit
light
a
persuasive
beer
will
buy
it
again
thanks
to
tolann
and
her
friends
for
sharing
beers
a
month
or
so
back
at
her
basement
party
this
one
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
smallish
light
tan
head
aromas
of
sweet
malt
caramel
raisins
and
toffee
on
the
palate
this
one
was
thick
and
full
bodied
with
tons
of
malt
caramel
and
booze
the
cpj
creamy
sikly
and
slick
a
bit
sticky
but
not
overly
cloying
complex
and
enjoyable
sipper
for
the
price
you
pay
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
best
values
around
for
a
beer
of
this
quality
and
style
dr
good
quality
easy
drinking
and
a
very
high
price
worth
a
go
if
you
love
the
style
i
guess
if
you
like
heavy
thick
sweet
and
sugary
dense
beer
with
some
pronounced
vinous
characteristics
and
loads
of
alcohol
hotness
that
spreads
around
your
belly
youll
like
this
one
poured
a
2
5
golden
head
and
has
a
beautiful
clear
orangy
gold
color
to
the
beer
smell
has
malt
and
sourdough
tasty
is
very
malty
a
touch
sweet
and
sour
and
strengthened
as
the
beer
warmed
moderate
malty
finish
despite
the
high
alcohol
its
very
well
hidden
and
sneaks
up
on
you
really
a
top
knotch
treat
and
im
becoming
quite
a
fan
of
kulmbachers
offerings
poured
as
a
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
the
head
didnt
last
very
long
and
didnt
leave
much
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
boozey
aroma
and
some
heavy
malts
in
the
background
the
taste
was
mostly
malts
along
with
a
nice
alcohol
heat
in
the
throat
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
though
and
very
drinkable
id
like
to
try
this
one
again
someday
just
to
see
what
i
think
of
it
now
after
having
beers
that
are
stronger
than
that
one
pours
a
dense
lively
almostwhite
head
crystal
clear
beautiful
the
color
of
fresh
bright
copper
some
noble
and
piney
hops
in
the
beggining
quickly
fading
leaving
aromas
of
dried
fruit
grapes
and
wine
lightly
floral
like
chamomile
tea
a
bit
sweet
with
lightly
fruity
and
floral
flavors
o
i
was
impressed
that
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
it
was
sweet
but
the
oak
and
vanilla
balanced
it
out
just
enough
from
it
becoming
overly
sweet
or
cloying
the
light
mouth
feel
really
hurt
for
me
o
a
very
complex
and
well
crafted
beer
this
is
a
sipper
or
a
warmer
a
high
abv
warming
spiced
malt
brew
this
beer
is
high
quality
d
this
is
a
big
sipping
beer
that
stands
up
like
a
big
barleywine
something
i
likely
never
would
have
tried
another
example
of
why
i
return
each
year
to
the
bomc
revisiting
this
beer
in
early
2013
i
almost
feel
like
i
had
a
bad
batch
last
time
i
dont
expect
that
is
actually
the
case
but
i
dont
get
any
of
the
obnoxious
flavors
i
remember
from
last
time
i
had
this
beer
in
fact
i
rather
liked
it
this
is
a
doppelbock
so
strong
in
flavor
and
alcohol
it
puts
many
eisbocks
to
shame
and
while
i
rarely
shell
out
the
20
for
a
sixpack
very
little
else
can
satisfy
the
craving
that
this
beer
engenders
from
the
bottle
to
a
tulip
pours
a
bright
copper
with
a
very
thin
head
smells
of
malt
and
alcohol
mouth
feel
is
somewhat
thin
with
some
level
of
tingliness
taste
is
well
balanced
with
malts
sweeter
hops
molasses
and
the
alcohol
is
present
this
was
an
experiment
for
me
and
i
was
pleased
definitely
a
one
and
done
due
to
the
abv
this
was
still
surprisingly
drinkable
smell
first
pushes
through
some
notes
of
sherry
along
with
some
dark
fruits
cherry
and
molasses
brown
sugar
there
as
well
lightly
sweet
and
a
bit
boozy
very
complex
flavor
isnt
quite
as
well
integrated
hitting
more
of
the
sweet
brown
sugar
notes
and
less
of
the
sherry
theres
also
quite
a
bit
more
booze
than
there
was
in
the
nose
feel
is
medium
with
low
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
quite
good
overall
very
different
than
the
typical
doppelbock
though
something
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
nicely
drinkable
huge
beer
but
a
bit
lacking
in
depth
and
complexity
overall
a
lighter
depth
of
flavor
than
i
had
anticipated
dangerously
easy
to
drink
considering
the
high
abv
the
alcohol
isnt
hidden
but
the
heat
it
provides
complements
rather
than
detracts
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
how
bold
in
flavor
it
was
the
aroma
was
strong
and
did
not
miss
any
crucial
components
for
a
doppelbock
the
flavor
profile
was
similar
in
that
it
included
everything
standard
where
this
beer
stands
apart
is
certainly
in
the
abv
which
is
over
the
top
but
seemingly
appropriate
for
such
a
big
brew
wow
anyone
want
the
rest
of
my
bottles
d
this
is
certainly
a
big
beer
and
i
realize
this
as
i
type
this
review
with
a
warm
alcohol
feeling
in
my
belly
very
well
crafted
and
a
good
example
of
a
strong
bock
if
you
like
big
beers
this
one
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
drinkability
once
again
another
perfect
example
of
a
sherryport
like
style
a
fine
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
next
to
the
fire
on
a
cold
winter
night
d
as
akin
to
the
samichlaus
the
eku
28
is
also
a
doppelbock
that
better
fits
the
profile
of
a
barley
wine
at
11
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
disguised
this
beer
is
good
but
i
would
generally
prefer
the
samichlaus
as
well
as
most
other
barley
wines
ive
tried
3
5
drinkability
definetly
a
sipper
for
its
price
range
3
50
for
a
12
oz
i
will
likely
look
at
other
alternatives
when
looking
to
drink
a
dopplebock
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
was
a
good
beverage
that
i
am
glad
i
tried
though
contrary
to
popular
belief
this
is
not
an
eisbock
there
is
no
freezing
process
used
by
kulmbach
in
the
brewing
of
this
beer
rather
the
beer
is
supposedly
allowed
to
ferment
for
several
months
whatever
the
methods
the
results
are
delicious
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
with
an
off
white
head
that
mostly
lasted
and
left
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
heavy
caramel
lots
of
alcohol
some
fruitiness
and
whiskey
notes
the
initial
flavor
was
moderately
sweet
malty
while
the
finish
was

a
little

good

i
am
defiantly
a
fan
of
this
beer
drinkability
i
would
save
this
beer
for
an
after
dinner
desert
type
would
not
drink
it
on
an
empty
stomach
on
a
hot
day
overall
it
would
be
really
good
for
certain
circumstances
but
not
all
d
this
is
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
slowly
sipped
given
its
alcohol
content
d
normally
i
would
say
this
is
a
big
boozy
mess
but
everything
seems
to
work
well
together
dim
curious
to
see
how
his
ages
compared
to
the
samichlaus
beers
this
isnt
very
complex
however
it
is
marginally
appealing
the
sugars
are
too
intense
but
with
some
time
this
might
be
a
less
expensive
alternative
to
samichlaus
foam
virtually
nonexistent
and
not
persistent
golden
brown
nose
alcohol
both
dry
and
sweet
a
little
like
a
mix
between
a
fullbodied
rosé
wine
a
bourbon
and
dried
fruit
alcohol
taste
very
bitter
and
sweet
on
sugar
especially
on
sugar
the
texture
is
thick
or
syrupy
and
reminiscent
of
the
cognac
finish
too
much
sugar
it
does
not
feel
like
drinking
a
beer
while
yet
there
are
a
number
of
beer
at
11
perfectly
drinkable
brilliantly
clear
auburn
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
caps
the
body
and
retains
well
toasted
caramelized
malt
aroma
very
clean
theres
a
hint
of
fruitiness
to
it
but
its
primarily
rich
malt
up
front
flavors
of
dates
and
toast
finishes
very
caramelized
chewy
and
rich
alcohol
is
surprisingly
well
hidden
and
it
ends
on
a
clean
note
drink
it
is
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
and
is
perfect
for
when
you
are
at
a
pub
after
a
awful
winters
work
day
and
are
determined
to
down
a
huge
rare
burger
thick
clear
reddish
copper
brew
gives
a
nice
1
light
tan
head
that
settles
fairly
quickly
to
a
thin
fizzy
layer
zero
lace
smells
thick
and
sweet
raisin
and
dried
cherry
a
bit
of
boozy
warmth
and
spice
feel
is
a
little
sticky
a
bit
thicker
and
sweeter
than
moderate
but
neither
is
in
the
extreme
taste
is
of
raisin
and
thick
overripe
banana
a
bit
nutty
finishes
with
licorice
spices
and
booze
alcohol
is
felt
a
bit
but
given
the
abv
is
hidden
fairly
well
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
nothing
spectacular
but
good
and
interesting
enough
that
id
drink
it
regularly
if
it
were
reasonably
priced
and
readily
available
certainly
gets
the
job
done
on
the
etoh
front
drinkability
is
good
especially
considering
the
alcohol
this
was
recommended
to
me
on
the
fly
definitely
glad
i
gave
of
a
shot
overall
the
beer
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
can
creep
up
on
you
if
drinking
quickly
the
beer
had
strong
notes
of
malt
and
was
what
i
expected
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
purchase
again
drinkability
this
is
a
finedrinking
beer
as
long
as
youre
used
to
such
a
taste
i
enjoy
this
now
way
more
than
i
used
to
and
i
think
its
a
great
example
of
its
style
definitely
worth
trying
it
almost
drinks
more
like
an
eisbock
than
a
doppel
because
its
so
strong
the
real
achievement
is
that
it
never
overwhelms
you
with
the
taste
of
alcohol
its
all
very
well
balanced
a
very
tasty
beer
but
i
think
its
best
to
be
sipped
d
good
starter
beer
for
a
night
but
would
not
drink
many
of
them
in
a
night
can
see
myself
easily
getting
drunk
on
this
beer
i
can
see
how
some
may
not
like
this
beer
but
i
enjoyed
it
d
a
definite
sipper
really
in
the
dessert
wine
arena
of
drinks
would
make
a
great
digestif
notes
smooth
and
well
integrated
flavors
delightful
conclusion
really
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
makes
a
pleasant
nightcap
if
id
thought
ahead
i
bet
some
pecans
would
go
really
well
with
this
drinkability
a
strong
sweet
potent
lager
with
the
overall
drinkability
youd
expect
from
such
a
brew
so
it
makes
for
a
decent
lateday
sipper
and
is
not
something
to
pound
in
the
early
afternoon
well
not
me
at
least
overall
eku
28
has
a
nice
aroma
taste
but
both
are
quickly
overpowered
by
the
alcohol
im
had
other
versions
of
this
style
and
enjoyed
them
but
this
was
a
disappointment
too
much
alcohol
presence
for
me
overall
the
boldest
dopplebock
i
have
yet
to
try
best
take
this
one
seriously
sip
and
enjoy
while
this
is
alot
bolder
than
i
prefer
a
dopplebock
it
is
a
great
beer
for
cold
winter
nights
wow
11
cannot
even
tell
i
hope
that
isnt
because
ive
tipped
a
few
tonight
but
i
am
impressed
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
and
likely
be
sorry
in
the
morning
the
label
says
it
is
never
cloying
wonderfully
aromatic
warming
renoun
beer
critic
michael
jackson
says
its
a
four
star
world
classic
who
am
i
to
argue
this
is
a
kick
ass
beer
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
with
medium
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
but
slightly
spoiled
by
the
high
alcohol
content
quite
interesting
and
drinks
better
than
i
anticipated
or
should
i
say
feared
given
its
robust
abv
as
room
temperature
is
approached
this
brew
sips
like
a
lightly
fruity
cordial
doppelbock
purchased
a
single
at
whole
foods
dedham
poured
into
my
ayinger
celebrator
glass
head
quickly
fades
to
nothing
dark
auburn
color
no
lacing
smells
sweet
and
boozy
taste
was
better
than
i
was
expecting
for
the
price
fruity
sugary
and
malty
as
the
bottle
says
this
beer
can
easily
replace
a
sherry
or
a
port
would
look
good
poured
into
a
snifter
i
bet
mouthfeel
was
definitely
thick
and
chewy
which
i
like
but
it
got
a
bit
sticky
on
the
palate
after
a
while
drinkability
was
good
even
though
this
beer
is
11
and
so
dense
a
good
choice
for
an
after
dinner
drink
d3
5
i
couldnt
drink
too
much
of
this
beer
but
the
12
oz
bottle
was
a
perfect
size
it
goes
down
well
and
hits
with
a
punch
at
11
percent
abv
good
beer
wouldnt
pass
this
up
if
i
found
it
again
atmosphere
is
pretty
solid
appearance
leaves
a
little
to
desire
and
the
nose
is
really
sweet
and
woody
flavor
is
strong
alcohol
sweet
and
heavy
a
little
bittersweet
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
d
rich
and
thick
the
malt
character
of
this
beer
is
not
overly
complex
but
it
is
incredibly
satisfying
the
toffee
character
that
dominates
the
flavor
is
intense
but
never
becomes
cloying
and
there
is
enough
caramel
and
molasses
to
add
depth
without
becoming
excessive
the
most
impressive
aspect
of
this
beer
is
what
you
dont
notice
there
isnt
a
hint
of
harshness
or
heat
from
the
11
abv
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
worth
seeking
out
beer
pours
a
medium
dark
orange
with
light
orange
head
something
i
would
expect
from
an
ipa
of
sorts
pretty
sweet
nose
cant
really
smell
the
booze
though
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
with
a
strong
ethanol
bite
in
the
finish
overall
sweetness
is
well
paired
with
stronger
tasting
foods
like
rotkohl
and
bwurst
it
goes
pretty
well
with
blutwurst
and
bread
but
the
sweetness
really
calls
for
somethign
savory
to
contrast
mouthfeel
is
smooth
a
little
prickliness
from
the
carbonation
has
a
heavy
and
somewhat
chewy
body
not
overly
drinkable
i
could
handle
one
of
these
before
moving
on
to
something
else
not
because
its
a
bad
beer
and
not
even
because
its
high
abv
its
really
due
to
the
sweet
malt
character
of
this
impressive
beer
the
11
0abv
is
not
inyourface
but
is
still
easily
spotted
despite
this
fact
this
is
still
a
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
just
dont
drink
too
many
or
too
quickly
as
i
think
that
it
would
cost
you
the
next
day
d
seems
youre
drinking
a
beer
with
30
abv
a
very
strong
beer
to
be
respected
i
finished
all
they
had
at
walmart
pours
a
clear
red
color
15
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
slight
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
sweet
malt
yeast
and
pale
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
doppelbock
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
alcohol
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
and
slight
pale
malt
overall
a
rather
pleasing
doppel
which
packs
a
punch
drinkability
i
feel
like
this
is
one
of
those
beers
which
i
appreciate
on
a
style
level
but
that
im
not
really
keen
on
drinking
much
its
pretty
tasty
but
this
is
a
stong
beer
nice
occasional
treat
there
is
a
hit
of
sweet
some
sour
layers
and
generally
a
pretty
complex
drink
the
11
alcohol
is
present
but
not
offensive
drinkability
thisll
creep
up
on
you
very
smooth
the
finish
for
this
particular
brew
was
a
medium
to
full
body
with
a
thinning
alcohol
on
the
tongue
that
leaves
a
warming
sweetness
behind
this
is
a
great
tasting
strong
beer
and
not
very
expensive
at
that
a
good
beer
for
a
cold
night
the
taste
is
loaded
with
abv
and
it
is
a
throaty
abv
at
that
at
11
this
beer
leaves
nothing
uncovered
it
packs
a
wallop
and
is
strong
it
is
medium
bodied
strong
a
tad
syrupy
with
florals
a
liqueur
alcohol
sweetness
some
candied
malts
some
burnt
alcohol
notes
and
just
rum
soaked
caramel
and
pineapple
this
beer
tastes
a
bit
like
it
has
been
or
should
be
flambeed
this
beer
is
just
too
strong
for
me
and
too
sherry
like
if
you
like
over
the
top
strong
double
bocks
than
start
here
aroma
pours
a
deep
amber
little
head
smell
a
very
deep
a
rich
portlike
smell
caramel
sweet
tones
as
well
taste
put
into
the
same
context
as
similar
beers
this
is
a
much
smoother
dopplebock
to
the
point
that
the
11
boozy
taste
is
toned
down
a
bit
making
this
somewhat
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
syrupy
this
is
good
to
try
but
if
your
going
to
sit
down
and
have
a
few
get
a
cab
final
thoughts
a
pretty
decent
doppeboch
pretty
heavy
but
not
too
heavy
big
malty
sweet
hit
with
lots
of
dark
fruits
and
some
molasses
and
even
finishes
bitter
and
still
semi
heavy
but
doesnt
overpower
the
finish
a
good
beer
now
but
i
think
itll
be
amazing
in
a
few
years
i
think
this
is
available
around
here
too
so
i
should
find
it
and
cellar
a
few
for
a
few
years
thanks
again
alex
especially
for
the
perfect
timing
d
this
beer
is
in
its
own
category
if
you
like
mirror
mirror
youll
love
this
stuff
at
a
fraction
of
the
cost
i
for
one
find
it
a
bit
too
sweet
but
its
still
a
great
beer
11
abv
does
put
a
smile
on
my
face
the
flavor
is
also
sweet
it
is
very
inviting
and
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
beer
is
completely
full
bodied
and
really
smooth
really
enjoying
this
beer
a
lot
drinkability
high
mouthfeel
high
not
the
worst
beer
ever
overall
not
much
to
look
at
but
this
beer
is
absolutely
delicious
and
would
be
an
amazing
cheese
beer
try
it
with
some
blue
or
even
a
really
funky
triple
cream
eku
28
is
probably
the
strongest
doppelbock
still
following
the
reinheitsgebot
at
the
price
point
its
no
wonder
this
is
reserved
for
german
royalty
d
a
sipper
for
sure
and
very
drinkable
despite
the
alcohol
would
love
to
see
what
some
cellaring
will
do
wow
a
truly
distinct
brew
after
researching
this
brew
i
found
a
truly
amazing
story
behind
it
poured
a
red
orange
but
mostly
brown
color
with
very
little
head
from
an
11
2
oz
bottle
into
into
a
chalice
smells
of
alcohol
and
toffee
with
hints
of
caramel
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
taste
is
considerably
warming
with
a
definite
candyburnt
sugar
presence
with
a
little
bit
of
scorched
apple
to
note
i
will
be
getting
this
beer
again
its
mouthfeel
is
that
of
an
extreme
beer
but
one
that
is
restrained
enough
to
still
be
called
a
beer
overall
a
good
and
a
richly
complex
beer
with
no
cheap
gimmicks
to
spike
the
beer
bowl
muy
bien
overall
its
a
heavy
duty
potent
brew
that
has
to
be
respected
in
order
to
enjoy
it
properly
the
other
brew
of
this
caliber
that
i
tried
was
samichlaus
and
this
blows
it
out
of
the
water
although
this
is
something
i
would
only
drink
on
say
christmas
or
thanksgiving
for
strong
german
brews
i
think
the
eisbocks
are
the
best
bet
d
big
abv
but
could
do
a
few
this
brew
is
billed
as
a
malt
liquor
on
the
label
which
also
touts
it
as
a
stand
in
for
a
fine
sherry
or
port
well
whoopteedoo
if
i
wanted
crap
wine
i
wouldnt
be
drinking
beer
i
dont
relish
being
the
iconoclast
but
this
libation
just
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
its
just
too
sweet
and
funky
for
rednecks
like
me
although
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
if
one
is
into
that
kind
of
stuff
i
didnt
have
any
wine
glasses
available
so
i
poured
it
into
a
mason
jar
all
the
parameters
were
there
for
a
great
beer
until
i
tasted
it
then
i
tried
to
pawn
it
off
on
my
wine
aficionada
daughter
no
suck
luck
turns
out
she
doesnt
like
sherry
or
port
either
d
this
drinks
much
like
an
english
barleywine
or
old
ale
with
fewer
fruity
notes
the
mild
alcohol
burn
reminds
you
that
this
is
potent
stuff
one
will
be
plenty
for
the
evening
has
a
dark
orangeamber
color
with
a
very
thin
dark
beige
head
that
dispersed
rather
quickly
has
a
light
sweet
smell
maybe
or
caramel
taste
is
initially
sweet
caramel
when
the
beer
first
hits
the
tongue
but
then
the
alcohol
hits
you
really
hard
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
but
you
dont
really
get
a
chance
to
savor
it
due
to
the
strength
of
the
alcohol
overall
a
decent
tasting
beer
but
too
strong
for
my
personal
taste
flavors
are
great
as
is
structure
and
scent
but
the
11
though
surprisingly
better
hidden
than
the
percentage
would
dictate
still
keeps
this
from
being
the
immediate
first
grab
from
the
fridge
i
liked
this
but
one
and
done
for
a
while
absolutely
worth
a
try
but
only
under
particular
circumstances
d
the
strength
of
this
one
definitely
dont
make
it
super
drinkable
for
me
but
its
very
drinkable
considering
its
strength
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
sweet
very
malty
and
mildly
carbonated
this
is
really
a
great
beer
d
not
to
say
this
isnt
a
fantastic
beer
but
the
level
of
alcohol
compounded
by
the
insane
malty
sweetness
doesnt
make
this
a
friendly
drinking
beer
it
demands
attention
with
how
big
it
is
way
too
boozy
to
be
considered
drinkable
but
its
still
enjoyable
ps
i
think
that
this
beer
most
be
considered
as
an
eisbock
it
is
brewed
by
freezing
a
dopplebock
and
taking
away
the
remaining
water
d
ive
got
mixed
feelings
on
eku
28
a
very
tasty
beer
but
a
little
rough
one
of
the
most
aromatic
and
delicious
doppelbocks
ive
had
but
its
a
bit
too
boozy
on
the
verge
of
being
a
truly
great
beer
if
they
could
just
hide
that
alcohol
a
little
bit
better
would
do
a
better
review
but
my
1
month
old
will
not
stop
crying
golden
body
reflecting
plenty
of
light
initial
thin
cap
of
foam
that
dwindled
to
a
thin
ring
appearance
was
much
like
a
barleywine
buttery
and
rich
aroma
strong
note
of
grapenuts
barley
and
a
slightly
vegetal
aged
hop
edge
sweet
malty
flavor
approaches
cloying
but
still
enjoyable
some
mild
buttered
popcorn
creeps
in
too
a
rich
and
malty
blanket
smothers
the
palate
very
slow
sipper
even
after
a
year
or
more
this
is
a
boozy
beast
d
when
i
was
younger
we
referred
to
this
as
your
trip
to
hell
because
of
the
high
alcohol
this
beer
is
definitely
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
if
i
were
sitting
outside
in
a
beer
garden
on
a
brisk
early
spring
day
eku
28
would
be
a
good
choice
to
have
in
front
of
me
this
was
one
fine
brew
underrated
i
would
compare
it
to
samichlaus
though
not
quite
as
rich
i
would
call
it
the
next
best
thing
which
is
pretty
damn
great
by
the
way
i
was
weary
of
spending
18
99
for
a
six
pack
of
this
but
i
feel
it
was
worth
it
this
is
one
for
aging
and
at
under
3
50
a
bottle
i
feel
that
i
cheated
the
store
pours
a
pure
copper
color
with
apparent
carbonization
bubbling
up
the
sides
to
a
rather
slight
head
head
quickly
dissipates
and
leaves
almost
no
lacing
a
very
sweet
malt
aroma
almost
a
rummy
alcohol
scent
i
cannot
put
a
finger
on
the
fruit
something
dark
like
raison
or
prune
maybe
provides
the
sweet
aroma
that
taste
is
incredible
a
spicy
alcohol
punch
that
is
muted
by
the
sweet
caramel
malt
backbone
the
alcohol
is
there
but
does
not
overtake
the
flavor
which
nice
given
the
abv
but
still
provides
a
nice
warming
effect
definitely
a
nice
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
the
mixed
flavors
it
does
leave
a
lasting
aftertaste
not
bad
but
just
a
side
effect
of
its
robust
flavor
a
bit
tart
in
your
mouth
and
obviously
rather
strong
its
a
slow
sippin
beer
one
i
feel
i
should
have
ended
the
night
on
rather
than
began
it
with
d
good
sweet
alcoholiccomplex
drinkability
cloyingly
sweet
but
a
nice
sipper
at
the
end
of
the
day
nevertheless
d
this
is
a
style
that
i
have
little
familiarity
with
due
to
its
rarity
so
i
dont
have
a
very
good
frame
of
reference
however
i
did
like
the
beer
and
would
try
again
if
given
the
opportunity
there
seems
to
be
some
complexity
in
the
malt
that
is
interesting
this
might
age
very
well
quite
drinkable
for
a
doppelbock
despite
its
hefty
alcohol
content
this
one
just
keeps
going
with
no
real
room
for
sipping
its
too
delicious
to
savor
for
long
d
i
love
this
beer
i
would
drink
it
every
day
if
it
werent
so
expensive
exellent
beer
all
around
very
balanced
for
a
doppelbock
nice
job
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
carbonated
and
full
bodied
the
finish
is
medium
and
lingers
on
the
palate
for
a
moment
this
beer
has
a
very
strong
malt
flavor
which
hides
the
alcohol
the
beer
is
extremely
smooth
and
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
very
well
made
the
only
thing
i
was
disappointed
is
the
head
was
nonexistent
i
can
make
room
for
this
one
in
my
beer
heart
typically
i
find
myself
shying
away
from
heavy
hitters
with
these
characteristics
i
knock
the
drinkability
up
a
half
drinkability
this
has
to
be
a
night
cap
and
a
beer
you
only
have
one
of
just
way
to
over
powering
and
though
high
alcohol
is
hidden
a
bit
just
thick
and
syrupy
for
more
then
a
nite
cap
an
okay
beer
but
not
one
that
leaves
you
wanting
another
d
a
nice
sipper
for
a
nightcap
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
with
a
large
pale
buff
head
the
foam
sticks
around
for
a
minute
or
so
before
drawing
back
to
a
small
cap
with
some
nice
lacing
smells
sweetly
of
roasted
caramel
malts
sherry
some
doughiness
and
a
hint
of
alchohol
very
strong
the
caramel
and
sherry
come
back
strongly
in
the
taste
along
with
some
orange
warming
alcohol
finish
thick
feel
bordering
on
syrupy
a
very
nice
sipper
but
its
not
quite
up
to
the
standard
of
kulmbachers
original
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
a
beer
of
which
one
is
plenty
the
high
abv
is
very
warming
and
the
thickness
of
body
makes
it
very
filling
it
has
a
great
nutty
taste
to
be
honest
i
thought
this
was
going
to
taste
more
like
wine
than
beer
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
taste
definitely
high
quality
notes
this
is
pretty
damned
tasty
the
taste
doesnt
quite
match
the
aroma
but
maybe
thats
just
me
overall
i
think
this
beer
could
use
a
few
more
years
in
the
cellar
the
alcohol
and
bitterness
is
still
quite
high
i
think
the
bouquet
would
greatly
improve
with
age
as
would
the
overall
character
of
the
beer
still
a
lovely
beer
not
all
that
thick
but
with
a
somewhat
chewy
feel
a
hint
of
syrup
in
the
feel
as
it
warms
belied
by
the
sharp
alcohol
there
are
some
nice
contrasts
in
this
beer
drinkability
well
with
11
abv
this
certainly
isnt
a
beer
you
pound
one
after
the
other
it
is
a
pleasant
sipper
though
pours
a
nice
clear
copperyred
with
a
fairly
thick
pale
yellow
head
that
does
not
stick
around
aroma
is
strong
and
more
fruity
than
malty
not
at
all
like
a
beer
with
such
a
high
alcohol
content
flavor
has
a
fairly
fierce
but
not
overwhelming
alcohol
bite
taste
is
mainly
sweet
and
fruity
with
an
undertone
of
caramel
more
like
liquor
than
beer
aftertaste
is
sweet
without
being
cloying
pours
clear
mahogany
with
a
tiny
offwhite
head
soapy
prune
and
raisins
aroma
with
heavy
ethyl
unusually
viscous
feeling
in
the
mouth
which
only
makes
the
beer
taste
heavier
it
tastes
like
overripe
apples
and
raisins
second
and
third
swigs
did
not
improve
my
feelings
very
disappointed
i
let
the
drain
sample
the
rest
too
sweet
and
the
lack
of
a
head
unbeery
look
along
with
its
fruity
smell
doesnt
do
it
any
favours
and
the
11
just
masks
its
shortcomings
the
taste
is
wonderful
rich
sweetspicey
oakywoody
with
strong
raisins
caremlized
dried
figs
turned
plums
caramelly
and
fruity
overall
with
nice
warming
alcoholicdriedfruit
spiciness
its
quite
sweet
but
so
wonderful
in
feel
and
taste
and
so
smooth
that
this
is
ok
drinkability
this
very
heavy
alcohol
presence
keeps
the
drinkability
down
however
the
lip
licking
sweetness
if
a
wonderful
suprise
this
is
an
excellent
sipping
beer
but
a
poor
session
selection
poured
a
copper
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
nose
of
malt
and
caramel
a
powerful
taste
of
malt
and
caramel
and
strong
presence
of
both
in
the
finish
the
alcohol
comes
through
as
an
after
affect
of
the
finsh
nice
flavor
but
definately
a
sipper
style
even
if
it
does
come
in
a
six
pack
this
beer
was
light
copper
color
very
clear
with
almost
no
head
at
all
i
guess
i
expected
little
head
or
head
retention
from
an
eisbock
so
i
can
rate
the
appearance
as
average
the
aroma
is
way
above
average
though
a
malt
bomb
with
hints
of
doppelbock
mixed
with
a
little
st
bernardus
abt
12
i
didnt
smell
any
alcohol
but
the
doppelbockabt
aroma
promised
it
would
be
strong
and
it
was
the
taste
was
strong
sweet
malts
and
alcohol
very
tasty
the
body
was
thick
enough
for
the
flavors
to
coat
my
mouth
very
filling
drinkability
is
average
i
couldnt
pound
this
or
even
go
for
a
second
beer
a
very
good
beer
which
id
recommend
to
malt
lovers
poured
into
goblet
a
very
nice
amber
clear
color
with
somewhat
thin
head
virtually
no
lacing
or
retention
but
a
beautiful
color
smell
was
a
bit
offputting
as
the
dominate
smell
to
me
was
alcohol
like
straight
up
rubbing
alcohol
some
sweet
malt
snuck
in
underneath
the
booze
tones
tastes
was
much
better
than
smell
a
very
sweet
and
malty
experience
at
first
followed
by
a
bit
of
fruit
cherries
i
swear
and
melon
followed
by
the
alcohol
a
very
warming
whiskey
like
sensation
as
it
goes
down
mouthfeel
was
thicker
which
seemed
appropriate
overall
a
good
beer
the
11
2
ozs
i
had
was
enough
but
i
could
revisit
this
drinkability
drinkable
hardly
tasty
sure
wellhidden
alcohol
hardly
high
alcohol
you
better
believe
it
this
is
one
monster
of
a
beer
and
though
its
not
the
tastiest
of
beer
or
the
most
wellhidden
in
terms
of
alcohol
its
not
too
shabby
pours
a
very
clear
amber
with
a
short
acting
thin
head
that
all
but
disappears
smells
super
sweet
with
notes
of
apples
hard
candies
but
also
subtle
hints
of
bananas
and
a
deep
overtone
of
the
high
alcohol
content
the
taste
is
almost
as
sweet
as
the
smell
candied
apples
sugar
cane
andor
brown
sugar
the
alcohol
taste
hangs
around
on
your
tongue
after
the
sweetness
subsides
which
was
expected
yet
not
overbearing
my
first
experience
with
an
eisbock
was
welcomed
with
open
arms
i
hope
its
not
the
last
long
live
high
gravity
drinkability
is
great
this
is
one
youll
enjoy
but
enjoy
slowly
drinkability
well
the
high
abv
is
a
bit
much
but
it
tastes
good
enough
to
have
a
couple
md
this
is
by
far
the
smoothest
lager
ive
ever
tasted
and
where
is
the
alcohol
i
hadnt
had
any
liquor
or
spirit
before
this
drink
and
yet
i
simply
couldnt
detect
any
bit
of
warming
alcohol
on
the
palate
or
down
the
throat
besides
the
finish
is
so
elegant
and
balanced
showing
no
syrupysticky
touch
at
all
making
one
wonder
what
has
gone
wrongso
great
during
the
brewing
of
this
lager
sip
by
sip
offguard
gradually
i
can
feel
the
strength
creeping
up
straight
to
the
head
but
never
to
the
stomach
throat
or
palate
all
in
all
this
is
a
wellcrafted
strong
lager
that
with
a
subtle
flavour
profile
and
welldisguised
strength
is
capable
of
melting
a
stubborn
iceberg
all
in
good
time
d
drinkability
is
good
this
beer
is
sweet
enough
and
strong
enough
to
make
it
hard
to
put
down
more
than
one
at
a
time
granted
that
is
exactly
what
to
expect
from
an
eisbock
this
one
is
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
mouth
thick
full
bodied
alcohol
and
caramel
in
deep
the
finish
and
aftertaste
is
very
malty
sweet
d
this
one
is
definitely
a
sipper
for
a
cold
winters
night
doesnt
work
so
well
in
the
middle
of
summer
heh
this
would
actually
be
a
good
campfire
beer
looks
absolutely
dropdead
gorgeous
color
ranges
from
light
copper
to
red
with
a
thin
dense
off
white
head
smell
is
mothwatering
hops
sugar
and
a
lingering
faint
floral
and
oak
note
flavor
is
wow
sweet
but
not
cloying
hop
accents
oranges
caramel
and
a
tangy
finish
mouthfeel
is
slick
a
touch
sticky
and
just
enough
carbonation
drinkability
is
limited
by
the
intensity
of
the
flavors
and
pronounced
alcohol
character
but
still
dang
buy
some
today
havent
had
on
of
these
is
some
while
so
decided
to
pick
up
one
at
ports
bottle
shop
poured
into
delirium
tremens
glass
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
finger
size
head
that
fades
rather
quickly
to
leave
traces
of
foam
and
lacing
smell
is
mixture
of
bannana
apple
carmel
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
great
with
carmel
apple
flavors
almost
like
a
jolly
rancher
while
there
is
a
little
heat
it
is
hidden
very
well
all
the
same
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
medium
body
and
slight
stickness
for
the
style
a
great
drinking
eisbock
but
this
one
can
make
for
a
rough
night
if
not
careful
pours
a
nice
reddish
amber
color
with
decent
head
and
lacing
it
has
a
very
deep
extremely
malty
scent
with
nice
caramel
overtones
a
wonderful
taste
very
deep
and
thick
huge
maltiness
with
a
great
figcaramel
flavor
it
goes
down
a
bit
thick
but
not
rough
a
wonderful
high
gravity
beer
a
new
favorite
of
mine
a
great
beer
lots
of
smooth
balanced
flavors
and
no
trace
of
the
abv
warm
and
honeyed
towards
the
finish
aftertaste
is
very
malty
sweet
overall
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
without
hesitation
that
said
i
think
one
in
an
evening
especially
given
its
high
alcohol
content
is
more
than
enough
certainly
a
strong
bock
basically
a
concentrated
version
of
the
style
with
part
of
the
water
frozen
out
not
bad
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
but
enjoyable
an
enjoyable
beer
once
it
is
allowed
to
warm
up
but
definitely
a
sipper
one
is
enough
in
an
evening
cigars
and
whiskey
civil
war
generals
and
lipstick
collard
ceos
rejoice
charcoal
aged
malt
straightens
your
posture
the
immature
days
of
your
youth
are
left
behind
with
the
magic
hat
9

to
experience
a
connoiseurs
nectar
booze
and

are
served
side

with
a

and

sexy
cognac
gives
port
a
hard
fucking
on
a
cereal
bed
of

a
wedding
of

until

unfortunatly
keeping
the

up

clear
your
sinuses
with
a
crazy
horse
dancer
via
slutty
widemouth
wine
glass
remember
to
chug

before

overall
impression
a
well
balanced
dangerously
drinkable
eisbock
wonderful
depth
and
maltiness
that
finishes
dry
works
for
me
any
time
of
year
but
probably
wonderful
by
a
fire
in
the
winter
not
my
cup
of
tea
shutter
shutter
cringe
if
i
want
a
buzz
this
bad
ill
go
jogging
and
get
an
exercise
high
beware
this
is
one
bad
a
elixer
im
glad
i
got
around
to
trying
eku
28
my
overall
impression
is
of
an
intense
doppelbock
with
a
sweeterthannormal
flavor
and
larger
alcohol
presence
definitely
worth
sampling
and
i
imagine
this
would
be
a
great
sipping
beverage
throughout
the
year
overall
a
phenomenal
brew
massive
not
session
but
a
slow
single
is
highly
recommended
i
had
never
heard
of
a
eisbock
until
now
but
there
is
a
first
time
for
everything
i
served
it
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
poured
a
lucid
auburn
color
with
a
nice
lacey
head
aromas
of
sweet
malt
and
a
light
rum
like
quality
is
in
the
nose
taste
was
very
sweet
grain
alcohol
like
with
some
fruit
in
the
back
and
a
dry
finish
that
stays
with
you
when
you
breathe
out
your
nose
i
little
to
alcoholic
for
me
my
first
eisbock
no
decipherable
date
code
pours
a
clear
med
orangecopper
color
w
a
thin
offwhite
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
in
my
snifter
a
strong
smell
a
cereal
grain
and
dark
malts
combined
with
plums
and
lots
alcohol
a
slight
buttered
caramel
undertone
a
rich
sweet
steely
grain
flavor
some
hop
bite
w
more
butter
here
a
nutty
faintly
vinous
sherrylike
note
about
midway
alcoholic
and
metallic
in
the
finish
a
thick
full
bodied
beer
indeed
not
much
on
the
co2
front
but
enough
to
keep
the
bubbles
around
wow
its
like
eating
a
big
ol
steak
could
be
more
drinkable
in
colder
weather
ill
have
to
try
more
of
the
style
to
be
sure
the
alcohol
and
medicinal
quality
is
just
a
bit
too
prominent
for
me
still
its
an
interesting
brew
if
youre
looking
for
a
high
alcohol
extreme
beer
thats
a
little
off
the
beatten
path
give
this
a
try
this
beer
shows
that
an
extreme
beer
doesnt
need
to
be
a
hop
bomb
and
that
malty
beers
can
hold
thier
own
in
the
extreme
arena
the
taste
is
quite
exquisite
everything
in
the
nose
but
much
more
more
intense
each
bit
enveloping
the
other
quite
a
complex
beer
with
rich
and
juicy
fruits
of
plum
cherry
a
little
fig
perhaps
toasty
and
sweet
not
too
much
hop
if
any
the
alcohol
blazing
a
path
but
still
out
of
the
way
countering
the
malt
from
being
too
cloying
the
mouth
is
full
rich
warm
very
nice
and
surprisingly
drinkable
for
such
a
high
alcohol
very
sweet
beer
which
says
a
lot
about
the
quality
of
this
beer
interesting
pours
a
bright
clear
copper
color
smell
is
clean
with
alcohol
and
caramel
fairly
delicate
aroma
taste
is
creamier
caramel
and
fairly
sweet
and
buttery
butterscotch
like
sweetness
about
it
and
a
touch
cloying
in
more
than
small
amounts
yet
not
bad
more
dessert
beer
like
than
casual
drinker
drinkablity
good
sipping
brew
provides
plenty
of
flavors
to
explore
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
but
the
one
i
had
i
was
sad
to
see
go
a
sipping
beer
to
savor
and
relish
d
this
is
very
smooth
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
not
realizing
how
potent
a
brew
this
was
if
nobody
told
me
it
was
11
abv
pours
a
clear
medium
amber
color
with
just
a
covering
of
offwhite
head
no
tracing
aromas
of
rich
malty
sweetness
raisin
winey
alcohol
that
is
almost
sherry
like
quite
clean
overall
but
appropriate
for
style
on
the
palate
a
graham
cracker
flavor
comes
through
first
following
with
a
dark
fruity
sweetness
hop
bitterness
next
and
warming
alcohol
sting
finish
this
is
quite
similar
to
the
urbock
23
as
lighter
dbs
go
overall
its
clean
not
overly
sweet
and
closer
to
a
sherry
than
a
beer
the
toasty
malts
are
very
subdued
and
its
more
the
fruit
and
hops
that
deliver
the
most
flavor
i
tend
to
favor
darker
styles
but
this
is
good
nonetheless
i
just
wanted
to
say
that
this
beer
is
a
shinning
example
of
how
flavorful
and
interesting
a
reinheitsgebot
beer
can
be
ive
had
beer
with
fruit
syrup
squirted
into
it
that
has
less
fruit
flavor
than
this
amazing
brew
with
such
a
creamy
and
foamy
mouthfeel
mixed
with
the
perfectly
sweet
caramel
fruitiness
i
feel
like
im
eating
a
really
smooth
fruit
custard
tart
or
cake
all
this
out
of
4
ingredients
prost
the
taste
was
a
sweet
bready
malt
that
was
syrupy
and
tasted
like
tangerines
the
mouthfeel
was
coated
by
the
syrup
nature
which
was
pleasing
and
it
tended
to
linger
on
the
tongue
overall
was
well
worth
the
price
i
would
have
it
again
for
sure
bottle
roasty
malty
burnt
caramel
aroma
with
hints
of
vanilla
marzipan
and
slight
alcohol

color
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
lasted
quite
a
while
raisiny
malty
slightly
sweet
with
some
alcohol
in
flavor
hop
bitterness
became
apparent
in
aftertaste
but
was
overshadowed
up
front
effervescent
with
fine
carbonation
full
bodied
almost
chewy
but
not
cloying
medium
finish
with
some
alcohol
apparent
in
aftertase
along
with
bitterness
and
some
sweetness
big
and
complex
but
very
well
executed
and
well
balanced
this
beer
has
very
sophisticated
taste
perhaps
a
little
sweet
for
me
but
still
pretty
good
big
chewy
texture
with
some
burn
from
the
alcohol
i
do
find
this
beer
to
be
quite
restorative
sip
this
on
a
cold
evening
and
forget
about
turning
on
the
heater
you
wont
need
it
the
flavors
are
complex
and
heavy
on
the
tongue
recommended
i
was
impressed
by
the
eku28
i
thought
it
might
be
a
little
too
much
on
the
sweet
side
from
reading
the
reviews
but
it
wasnt
overthetop
sweet
a
very
good
beer
if
you
like
them
malty
pours
a
clear
amberish
red
color
with
no
head
to
speak
of
smells
a
bit
sour
with
some
fruit
notes
the
taste
is
superb
for
the
style
subtlely
sour
yet
still
smooth
and
creamy
with
some
liquor
tones
too
the
mouthfeel
is
velvety
period
all
the
way
through
drinks
easy
enough
more
than
just
worth
a
try
this
pours
a

very
fast

is
of

and
dark

taste
follows
with
caramelized
dark
fruit
and
typical
good
sugary
eisbock
flavor
very
tasty
mouthfeel
is
good
but
maybe
a
little
thin
drinkability
is
good
sugar
resides
on
the
lips
after
each
sip
and
taste
lingers
somewhat
abv
is
very
well
hidden
but
you
can
feel
the
warmth
in
your
stomach
reminds
me
alot
of
the
urbock
from
eggenberg
but
clearer
color
good
beer
one
i
will
revisit
next
time
i
go
into
my
cellar
overall
pretty
good
i
think
i
would
go
for
their
other
eisbock
more
times
than
not
but
this
one
is
nice
to
sip
on
when
in
the
mood
d
drinkability
may
be
limited
due
to
the
viscous
sweet
syrupy
nature
and
high
alcohol
content
definity
a
sipper
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
though
to
be
honest
its
not
my
cup
of
tea
d
while
perhaps
i
havent
been
personally
blown
away
by
the
taste
or
feel
it
is
still
quite
drinkable
without
question
i
have
only
had
this
brew
twice
before
both
times
with
a
coworker
who
really
likes
german
brews
i
am
sooo
glad
i
took
time
to
review
it
almost
certainly
the
most
perfect
for
the
style
brew
ive
reviewed
thus
far
again
very
syrupy
but
moderately
bright
do
to
good
carbonation
the
thicker
texture
still
comes
out
however
a
slicker
finish
is
characterized
by
some
more
booze
induced
warmth
an
interesting
beer
experience
but
just
not
a
selection
id
drink
on
a
regular
basis
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
medium
to
thick
bodied
carbonation
is
excellent
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
obviously
its
strength
hinders
it
in
that
department
but
still
very
drinkable
overall
very
good
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
walk
away
very
impressed
pours
crystal
clear
dr
browns
cream
soda
color
smells
like
ripe
bananas
tastes
like
caramelized
bananas
with
a
heavy
alcohol
presence
what
can
i
say
this
tastes
like
a
banana
flambes
with
all
the
liquor
too
not
bad
but
not
great
either
11
kicks
in
pretty
quick
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
one
finger
head
that
recedes
without
leaving
lacing
nose
has
a
lot
of
alcohol
present
i
want
to
say
just
a
touch
of
gingerbread
maybe
extremely
sweet
on
the
tongue
almost
as
if
it
were
a
dessert
drink
alcohol
barely
comes
through
at
the
end
but
you
cant
tell
you
are
downing
11
on
this
one
which
makes
it
dangerously
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
with
a
syrupy
tone
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
one
sitting
id
imagine
but
just
be
sure
to
call
a
cab
full
aftertaste
a
bit
alcoholic
not
too
full
bodied
but
quite
full
in
the
mouth
d
clear
reddish
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
just
a
little
off
white
lacing
heavy
malt
characters
caramel
molasses
prune
and
cherry
all
kept
in
check
by
a
big
alcohol
ester
the
taste
echoes
much
of
the
nose
a
bit
fruitier
brandy
like
fusels
caramelized
sugars
and
hops
providing
a
thin
bitterness
and
tea
notes
the
alcohol
while
mildly
hot
is
smooth
and
keeps
the
thick
mouthfeel
from
being
too
syrupy
the
finish
has
a
slow
tartness
and
reveals
some
vinous
character
full
bodied
and
silky
smooth
thanks
to
todd
the
beer
guy
buckspin
for
this
one
pours
a
clear
brown
golden
color
with
no
head
smells
like
very
sweet
malt
with
hints
of
candied
fruit
tastes
like
malt
with
alcohol
hitting
you
right
up
front
actually
alcohol
taste
is
quite
dominate
mouthfeel
is
quite
syrupy
overall
it
tastes
like
alcohol
but
not
any
negative
sense
but
the
sweetness
does
not
last
appearance
has
a
nice
amber
with
very
little
to
no
head
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
and
grainy
taste
is
wow
in
your
face
like
a
rich
desert
that
is
almost
to
much
to
handle
with
sweet
malts
dark
fruits
and
spiciness
with
an
alchohol
punch
mouthfeel
is
full
and
syrupy
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
with
this
beer
besides
the
high
abv
but
turns
out
to
be
a
combonation
with
the
full
flavor
making
it
a
good
warming
sipping

review

translated
from
french

served
in
a
tall
corsendonk
glass
this
beer
has
a
rich
ruby
red
color
with
a
short
lived
head
nose
is
overwhelmingly
one
of
malt
it
reminded
me
of
a
wort
brewing
before
i
add
the
hops
taste
is
also
quite
powerful
strongly
malty
with
hints
of
bread
and
raisins
minimal
carbonation
with
a
syrupy
character
and
a
strong
taste
of
alcohol
definitely
not
a
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
great
sipper
on
a
cold
fall
evening
this
isnt
the
best
eisbock
ive
had
but
its
not
too
bad
either
i
can
see
buying
more
of
these
as
this
is
significantly
cheaper
than
some
of
the
others
nice
lager
cleanliness
and
bold
and
flavorful
nasty
this
was
one
thick
drink
very
sticky
almost
like
a
lite
syrup
sticks
to
your
mouth
to
let
all
the
flavor
be
released
not
something
i
could
drink
all
night
but
still
very
tasty
and
smooth
recommended
drinkability
is
pretty
solid
for
a
brew
boasting
11
abv
i
enjoyed
every
sip
but
some
feel
it
is
a
love
it
or
hate
it
kind
of
beer
i
recommend
it
highly
this
beer
pours
a
clear
tawny
red
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
off
white
with
pink
hues
in
color
lacing
is
decent
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
with
a
grassy
noble
hop
character
the
taste
is
of
caramel
with
a
nice
hint
of
ginger
and
more
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
will
certainly
have
again
bham
uk
overall
sickly
sweet
interesting
colour
and
aroma
but
not
my
style
d
warms
well
alcohol
never
overpowering
fine
and
relaxing
sipping
brew
not
mind
blowing
but
worth
a
try
d
this
is
an
all
around
winner
an
outstanding
sipping
beer
that
could
serve
in
place
of
a
single
malt
after
dinner
by
the
fire
this
was
served
in
a
pint
glass
but
i
should
have
asked
for
a
snifter
this
will
be
a
wintertime
staple
in
my
cellar
a
nice
sipper
and
quite
enjoyable
but
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
is
not
an
option
any
fan
of
eisbocks
should
seek
this
one
out
an
enjoyable
dessert
this
beer
itd
probably
be
even
more
enjoyable
on
a
fall
or
winters
night
but
its
hitting
the
spot
on
an
august
night
in
hot
eastern
wshington
just
the
same
d
the
flavor
certainly
makes
it
worth
another
but
the
alcohol
content
and
the
thickness
make
multiples
difficult
this
is
one
heck
of
a
sipper
though
drinkability
i
think
ive
found
a
beer
style
im
not
overly
very
fond
of
ive
had
the
aventinus
as
well
and
my
responses
were
very
similar
d
this
really
is
like
a
fine
sherry
or
port
it
would
probably
be
best
served
after
a
meal
not
with
one
good
taste
but
very
powerful
this
is
a
nice
sipping
brew
that
is
much
easier
to
drink
than
the
abv
level
would
usually
have
it
to
be
cellared
for
two
years
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
shade
of
tawny
amber
with
bronze
highlights
soapy
offwhite
two
and
a
half
finger
head
showing
respectable
retention
for
a
fortified
beverage
but
leaves
no
lacing
the
nose
is
heavy
with
apricot
brandy
dark
crystal
malt
and
deeply
toasted
notes
like
special
b
or
aromatic
malt
a
background
aroma
of
cider
gets
stronger
as
it
warms
as
does
the
faintest
trace
of
perfumey
noble
hops
immense
caramel
and
roasted
nutty
flavor
on
the
first
sip
sweet
isnt
quite
a
sufficient
definition
raisin
phenols
and
apple
ester
add
more
depth
to
the
malt
profile
while
a
mellow
yet
firm
hop
bitterness
begins
to
round
out
the
formidable
sweetness
true
balance
is
achived
in
the
aftertaste
when
a
dark
fruity
booze
character
provides
the
slow
burn
that
gradually
dries
the
residual
sugar
fullchewy
body
with
a
fine
carbonation
that
seems
intentionally
light
to
emphasize
the
malt
complexity
and
thick
mouthfeel
this
is
a
sipper
and
not
intended
for
hurried
consumption
and
it
also
never
becomes
cloying
or
overwhelming
the
alcohol
is
warm
but
not
hot
and
the
malt
is
tremendous
but
fades
out
allowing
a
very
managable
finish
certainly
worth
the
wait
as
this
is
simply
too
abrasive
when
young
and
could
perhaps
benefit
from
another
year
in
the
cellar
eku
28
pours
a
brilliant
crystal
clear
orange
with
a
light
wispy

aroma
is
malts
some
light
fruitiness
maybe
even
some
sweet
orange
aroma
flavor
is
rich
and
sweet
tons
or
sweet
caramel
taste
the
beer
has
a
soft
fruit
flavor
with
almost
no
hops
to
speak
of
it
is
very
clean
and
well
balanced
the
alcohol
is
not
hidden
but
not
too
bad
for
11
reddish
pour
with
an
ample
off
whitelight
beige
head
not
long
lasting
and
not
much
lace
malt
predominates
in
the
aroma
lightly
spicy
flavor
starts
out
with
some
not
real
pleasant
fusel
notes
but
these
disappear
as
the
beer
warms
to
a
good
drinking
temperature
flavors
are
sweet
mildly
spicy
with
a
bit
of
caramel
kind
of
like
a
toneddown
samichlaus
alcohol
ends
up
being
well
disguised
in
the
beer
not
extremely
complex
but
tasty
and
at
the
price2
12
a
bottle
quite
drinkable
a
nice
beer
would
not
have
assumed
it
was
11
if
not
for
the
label
hope
the
street
people
dont
find
out
about
this
beer
lol
pours
a
nice
dark
gold
with
decent
head
the
nose
is
all
malt
and
a
alcohol
haze
that
serves
as
a
warning
the
first
taste
is
malty
big
and
hot
with
each
sip
coming
easier
with
a
decided
smoothness
considering
the
abv
compared
to
giraffe
faxe
strong
etc
this
is
a
well
made
beer
that
is
pretty
darn
strong
i
like
that
it
comes
in
a
can
catch
up
beer
lol
big
maltytoffee
aroma
you
pretty
much
only
get
from
a
true
german
bock
brew
very
very
nice
actually
theres
also
a
strong
fruitiness
which
you
dont
get
all
that
often
in
a
german
lager
even
so
its
a
clean
fruitiness
so
you
know
its
still
a
lager
beautiful
amber
color
with
a
slight
head
but
one
that
seems
to
stick
around
after
pouring
it
into
a
glass
the
appearance
and
aroma
of
this
brew
just
make
me
want
to
immediately
take
a
sip
carbonation
is
decent
and
appropriate
for
the
style
but
some
previous
bottles
have
been
too
low
flavor
is
a
malt
assault
on
the
tongue
combined
with
some
heat
from
the
alcohol
the
flavor
improves
on
the
aroma
with
a
huge
maltytoffee
explosion
on
the
tongue
i
get
ripe
fruits
perhaps
some
apple
but
even
more
im
getting
some
beautiful
ripe
pear
flavors
have
you
ever
forked
over
the
money
to
buy
some
harry
and
davids
royal
riviera
pears
theyre
expensive
but
ohhh
so
good
natures
candy
anyway
i
definitely
get
some
of
that
great
ripe
oregon
pear
character
in
this
brew
when
i
first
tasted
this
beer
ten
years
ago
i
wasnt
crazy
about
it
now
its
one
of
my
occasional
favorites
its
not
something
i
would
drink
often
but
i
love
to
keep
some
on
hand
for
the
times
when
im
in
the
mood
and
it
seems
to
hold
up
incredibly
well
in
my
fridge
for
long
periods
of
time
theres
no
denying
eku
28
is
a
malty
brew
even
for
german
standards
yet
it
still
has
a
nice
cleanfermented
lager
taste
even
though
the
malt
character
is
strong
i
dont
think
this
brew
goes
too
far
with
its
maltiness
take
vetter
33
on
tap
in
heidelberg
for
comparison
vetter
33
is
too
overthetop
malty
and
has
way
too
much
of
an
unfermented
maltsyrup
taste
eku
28
on
the
other
hand
is
much
more
drinkable
and
thoroughly
fermented
i
really
enjoy
this
brew
but
i
can
imagine
that
some
dont
because
its
a
bit
extreme
eku
28
has
definitely
become
a
brew
ive
come
to
love
over
the
years
if
you
disagree
thats
okay
that
just
leaves
more
for
me
oelergud
drinkability
definitely
the
lightest
beer
of
this
strength
ive
ever
had
remarkably
drinkable
almost
like
a
cross
between
a
barleywine
and
a
bock
very
nice
this
one
was
a
pleasant
surprise
drinkability
id
have
it
again
but
would
be
interested
in
laying
a
bottle
down
for
five
years
or
so
to
see
what
happens
overall
recommended
want
something
to
drink
by
the
fire
this
is
it
notes
yowser
this
stuff
is
pretty
strong
despite
that
i
didnt
feel
much
of
a
kick
after
having
all
11
2
ounces
this
stuff
gave
me
goosebumps
the
farther
i
got
along
with
it
d
overall
this
will
kick
your
butt
if
you
have
more
then
one
it
really
did
come
off
as
a
bit
too
strong
maybe
tone
down
the
alcohol
and
puff
up
the
hops
and
it
could
be
a
fine
frink
maybe
i
let
one
sit
down
for
some
months
though
i
dont
know
how
it
will
age
this
is
very
intresting
and
a
definate
sipper
a
good
one
to
try
there
is
a
big
malt
flavor
up
front
with
caramel
dark
fruits
and
a
raisin
quality
to
it
there
is
a
very
slight
hop
balance
but
the
finish
is
very
alcoholic
and
warming
this
is
in
no
way
a
bad
thing
in
fact
it
is
quite
a
pleasant
sensation
its
almost
more
akin
to
a
brandy
or
port
wine
mouthfeel
is
clean
but
a
bit
thin
even
at
11
this
beer
remains
fairly
drinkable
overall
this
is
one
powerful
beer
that
is
meant
to
be
a
sipper
highly
recommended
pours
a
deep
honey
with
some
rather
active
carbonation
in
the
body
a
thin
head
that
eventually
turns
into
a
thin
ring
and
some
lace
clinging
to
the
sides
lot
of
hot
alcohol
in
the
nose
with
some
sweet
honey
and
bready
malts
smells
kind
of
worty
the
alcohol
along
with
some
light
fruits
hit
the
palate
first
bread
honey
and
pears
continue
on
into
the
finish
which
has
an
almost
medicinal
quality
but
it
doesnt
go
too
far
mouthfeel
is
thick
slick
and
with
a
soft
and
mellow
carbonation
with
the
high
alcohol
this
one
is
a
sipper
having
this
bottle
at
home
but
im
sure
they
have
it
at
bodega
downtown
la
crosse
too
poured
with
a
big
thick
foamy
luscious
light
tan
head
and
some
lace
most
head
disappeared
except
for
a
thin
cover
nose
was
intensely
malty
caramel
toffee
and
bitter
yeast
this
is
just
out
of
my
cold
fridge
and
its
great
i
know
itll
be
better
as
it
warms
still
the
flavor
is
very
good
like
the
aroma
but
better
great
body
very
mouthfilling
with
just
the
right
carbonation
having
it
with
a
bowl
of
spicy
congee
good
match
nice
finish
that
is
yeast
bitter
at
first
fading
to
the
above
sweet
flavors
very
rich
not
a
session
beer
but
one
or
two
is
fine
i
alwasy
thought
the
eku
stuff
looked
rather
curious
so
i
picked
up
a
bottle
without
any
clue
that
it
was
an
eisbock
it
poured
surprisingly
light
orange
color
with
pretty
much
no
head
this
is
certainly
the
lightest
shaded
version
of
the
style
i
have
seen
though
i
have
not
seen
many
smell
was
very
boozy
and
fruity
apples
seem
definitely
there
taste
was
on
the
malty
side
with
viscous
honey
raisins
and
more
booze
this
beer
seems
to
explode
when
it
swishes
around
the
palate
bursting
with
flavor
in
every
way
it
is
a
bit
carbonated
not
not
too
much
while
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
for
sure
it
is
also
pretty
strong
and
heavy
one
or
two
bottles
at
a
time
seems
appropriate
to
me
final
thoughts
a
nice
beer
for
sure
maybe
not
the
best
eisbock
i
have
had
but
still
enjoyable
i
would
like
to
see
how
it
is
on
tap
i
can
have
this
occasionally
but
it
depends
on
the
time
and
place
this
may
be
a
good
one
to
finish
the
night
with
not
very
drinkable
for
me
if
i
want
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
boozy
flavors
ill
probably
go
the
baltic
porter
route
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
it
just
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
eisbocks
im
used
to
drinking
from
new
glarus
capital
the
dane
and
aventinus
ive
decided
to
pour
this
into
my
la
moneuse
glass
being
bereft
of
a
snifter
at
this
time
the
beer
puts
up
a
shortlived
head
that
fades
in
less
than
ten
seconds
to
a
thin
glass
ring
the
body
has
a
beautiful
color
though
its
a
transparent
rubycopper
the
nose
is
full
of
brown
sugar
dark
bread
and
the
scent
of
pecan
pie
which
may
very
well
be
the
first
time
ive
said
this
about
a
beer
very
interesting
the
taste
is
a
nearcloying
caramel
and
light
brown
sugar
experience
i
honestly
dont
think
theres
more
to
it
than
that
but
it
tastes
wonderful
in
very
small
sips
the
mouth
might
be
one
of
the
thickest
ive
ever
come
across
with
almost
nonexistent
carbonation
but
really
i
cant
see
a
combat
beer
like
this
having
any
bubbles
to
lighten
the
load
it
just
wouldnt
feel
right
if
i
could
have
this
with
pecan
pie
or
a
hefty
chocolate
dish
or
creme
brulee
or
well
suffice
it
to
say
this
is
a
great
one
di
wanted
to
pour
it
out
after
first
sip
simply
too
damn
sweet
if
you
want
a
much
much
better
example
of
eisbock
get
a
kulmbacher
eisbock
something
worth
cellaring
for
a
year
maybe
two
it
poured
with
little
to
no
head
it
had
a
sweet
malt
aroma
and
a
pleasant
maltbourboncaramelspice
flavor
not
bad
but
not
as
complexnuanced
as
i
was
led
by
the
label
description
to
expect
mouthfeel
was
full
and
slightly
puckery
this
beer
is
not
extremely
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
its
supposed
to
be
nice
beer
d
good
beer
to
enjoy
after
a
long
day
very
well
balanced
but
the
alc
keeps
you
from
having
a
few
pours
a
very
nice
bright
copper
colour
with
a
correct
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
some
lace
that
fades
too
in
a
couple
of
minutes
smell
is
of
dark
fruits
and
brandy
or
port
with
hints
of
vanilla
almonds
and
cherries
and
caramel
too
taste
is
sweet
very
strong
caramel
vanilla
and
cherries
are
noticed
too
with
a
slightly
bitter
touch
in
the
end
this
is
really
a
very
fine
beer
but
if
you
have
tried
samichlaus
before
it
pales
in
comparison
then
again
any
other
beer
do
i
wont
rule
this
beer
out
in
the
future
especially
on
a
windy
day
where
that
alcohol
bite
will
be
appreciated
but
for
right
now
this
beer
did
not
leave
as
favorable
impression
as
id
hoped
notes
i
paired
this
with
a
christmas
mince
pie
the
sweetness
of
the
mince
pie
accentuated
the
fresh
bready
malts
more
taking
away
the
syrupy
feel
which
made
it
all
the
more
enjoyable
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
light
carbonation
high
abv
along
with
thick
alcohol
and
incredibly
sweet
malts
kind
of
hinder
the
drinkability
nonetheless
id
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
thinks
they
can
handle
it
notes
this
is
a
tremendous
sipping
beer
i
must
have
savored
this
for
an
hour
with
half
the
time
spent
enjoying
its
incredible
bouquet
very
good
beer
for
coming
in
out
of
the
cold
the
flavor
was
very
sweet
but
mellow
like
caramel
or
molasses
there
was
a
bit
of
tartness
as
well
like
tart
apples
lots
of
alcohol
and
some
smokiness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
creamy
somewhat
thick
and
syrupy
and
very
good
my
first
eisbock
not
what
i
expected
but
a
pleasant
surprise
ill
have
to
explore
more
this
winter
very
malty
and
bocklike
but
not
as
heavy
of
an
alcohol
faceslap
as
anticipated
after
the
initial
whiff
actually
considering
the
abv
this
is
actually
quite
downable
mouthfeel
is
mellow
and
holds
the
flavor
well
without
punishing
the
drinker
with
carbonation
this
style
is
by
no
means
my
speed
but
this
is
a
good
effort
from
the
boys
at
kulmbacher
this
ones
intense
and
really
sweet
arguably
too
sweet
for
me
look
im
not
an
expert
and
i
dont
pretend
to
be
but
this
is
the
beer
to
drink
get
one
asap

characteristics
which
made
this
very
enjoyable
also
dominated
taste
body
is
a

light
and
alcohol
was
not
overly
pronounced
not
exactly
sure
why
this
is
getting
such
low
ratings

i
though
it
was
a
well
craft
eisbock
a
transparent
amber
with
a
slight
reddish
hue
and
no
head
whatsoever
the
nose
has
lots
of
alcohol
sherry
raisin
fig
and
cherry
but
alcohol
is
dominant
here
you
get
a
lot
of
that
and
more
when
you
taste
it
prune
raisin
anise
brandy
cloves
malt
mollasses
and
something
that
tastes
like
good
n
plenties
not
just
anise
or
licorice
bu
really
like
a
good
n
plenty
this
has
some
light
effervescence
and
is
otherwise
a
hard
drinking
beer
too
much
alcohol
makes
this
a
sipping
monster
hard
to
enjoy
this
like
a
regular
beer
even
for
the
style
its
a
bit
much
and
i
much
prefer
the
aventinus
eisbock
slightly
dark
colour
malt
aroma
bit
of
crowning
white
head
little
bitterness
i
found
this
more
malty
drinkable
than
the
austrian
eisbocks
although
still
an
egg
yolk
taste
in
it
surprisingly
high
alcohol
content
that
was
well
hidden
thanks
biegaman
not
totally
bad
a
very
small
glass
might
would
be
nice
to
sip
after
dinner
but
12
ounces
are
about
9
ounces
too
many
drinkability
the
overwhelming
taste
of
alcohol
meant
i
would
not
want
more
than
one
of
these
in
sitting
a

mouthfeel
is
impressive
light

but
not
assertive
on
the
palette
a
fantastic
appertif
barleywine
even
a
little
more
assertive
on
hops
could
do
it
good
but
that
isnt
the
german
style
i
know
we
can
leave
that
to
the
americans
slight
stickyness
to
the
finish
but
distant
11
i
had
no
idea
a
little
too
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
compartment
grows
more
syropy
but
still
a
magnificent
makeup
candy
malt
slightly
onedimensional
a
winner
but
im
not
entirely
impressed
because
i
know
this
could
be
more
this
started
out
promising
but
was
reallly
not
very
good
poured
to
a
brownish
red
with
medium
tan
head
and
had
an
aroma
of
malty
dark
fruit
unfortunately
the
head
dissipated
almost
immediately
and
left
zero
lacing
in
addition
as
beer
warmed
the
11
alcohol
became
the
overwhelming
aroma
and
taste
so
that
by
the
end
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
some
cheap
rockgut
or
moonshine
not
impressed
with
eku
28
my
first
eisbock
and
i
have
to
agree
with
the
last
reviewer
a
very
good
beer
and
not
something
i
can
drink
more
than
1
or
2
in
a
sitting
almost
a
maplebrown
sugar
flavor
very
heavy
and
slightly
sweet
not
much
head
fairly
bubbly
almost
similar
to
an
old
ale
but
not
nearly
as
rough
and
bitter
more
sweet
than
harsh
very
oily
on
the
palate
a
nice
offering
but
not
something
to
drink
that
often
d
due
to
its
strength
and
body
itd
be
tough
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
in
one
sitting
however
that
doesnt
stop
it
from
being
a
very
good
beer
its
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
a
cold
night
ill
be
buying
several
some
to
drink
now
and
some
to
cellar
and
taste
through
the
years
33cl
bottle
this
one
pours
a
fairly
clear
amber
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
offwhite
head
that
drops
off
quickly
to
leave
a
glass
with
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
bit
sweet
mainly
notes
of
caramel
and
raisins
to
the
nose
possibly
some
other
fruits
and
a
bit
brownsugary
also
there
is
a
flatness
to
the
taste
the
carbonation
is
already
gone
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
caramel
malts
and
some
dark
fruits
maybe
a
hint
of
oakiness
in
there
also
not
bad
drinkability
overall
a
very
nice
beer
that
would
be
good
on
an
occasional
basis
but
be
careful
with
this
one
although
eisbocks
are
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
i
would
probably
buy
again
in
the
future
drinkability
strong
sweet
and
fabulous
still
new
to
the
world
of
eisbocks
not
quite
as
flavorful
as
aventinus
but
very
good
nonetheless
a
bit
strong
to
have
more
than
one
though
winter
after
dinner
drink
one
is
just
right
a
little
low
in
carbonation
but
a
nice
thick
taste
appropriate
for
11
alcohol
leaves
the
taste
nicely
on
the
lips
salud
d
terrific
flavor
and
smell
to
be
enjoyed
in
moderation
high
alcohol
level
germanys
strongest
beer
and
complex
flavors
make
this
one
to
be
savored
with
dinner
or
dessert
i
had
mine
with
a
dinner
of
a
bacon
blue
cheese
burger
and
fries
they
went
quite
well
together
eku
28
needs
a
more
exciting
name
it
could
also
use
a
better
look
but
then
i
dont
care
too
much
about
that
with
beer
of
this
sort
im
enjoying
it
more
and
more
as
i
delve
into
the
final
third
of
the
bottle
and
am
enjoying
the
warmth
that
is
spreading
from
my
stomach
outward
despite
the
heat
of
the
day
ill
have
to
buy
another
few
bottles
for
those
inevitable
subzero
iowa
winters
overall
a
nice
sipping
beer
not
one
id
have
more
than
a
couple
in
a
sitting
poured
almost
amber
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
no
lacing
nose
is
full
of
strawberries
caramel
and
a
tad
bit
of
grapefruit
taste
is
largely
the
same
with
pleasant
bitterness
in
the
tail
end
mouth
is
carbonated
with
some
of
the
tiniest
bubbles
ive
come
across
i
can
see
myself
buying
this
again
for
sure
salud
powerful
stuff
for
sure
yet
not
overly
so
still
a
bottle
or
two
and
youll
be
done
numbs
the
old
noggin
taste
this
very
sweet
and
that
graininess
comes
through
in
the
taste
but
not
quite
as
strongly
as
in
the
smell
vanilla
cherries
and
caramel
malts
all
come
through
as
well
and
theres
also
an
almost
oak
barrel
flavor
going
on
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
but
its
a
bit
on
the
syrupy
side
for
me
and
with
the
alcohol
so
strong
its
definitely
a
sipper
this
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
large
head
for
a
high
alcohol
beer
the
smell
is
strong
with
vanilla
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
sweet
with
vanilla
malt
fruit
and
some
oak
aging
this
has
a
borban
flavor
to
it
thats
just
great
the
mf
is
heavy
with
all
the
flavors
mixing
well
this
is
the
best
eisbock
ive
had
excellant
drinkable
yes
but
not
one
that
is
gonna
be
a
session
beer
lol
just
a
nice
after
dinner
cold
weather
dessert
beer
which
i
found
i
liked
the
eisbock
is
mediumheavy
on
the
palate
somewhat
syrupy
with
a
gentle
level
of
carbonation
thats
fitting
for
this
slowdrinking
beer
finish
is
dry
with
a
moderate
alcohol
burn
this
eisbock
is
not
as
fruity
or
caramelmalt
heavy
as
the
other
eisbocks
ive
had
and
enjoyed
more
have
been
i
think
this
is
the
major
aspect
that
the
beer
could
be
improved
upon
orange
body
with
no
head
smells
of
rich
fruity
malt
alcohol
isnt
apparent
but
you
know
its
going
to
be
big
more
dark
fruit
malts
with
licorice
no
hops
flavor
all
malt
here
very
smooth
drinking
and
tasty
feels
like
at
first
but
youll
know
what
youre
drinking
after
the
first
few
sips
interesting
beer
makes
me
think
german
old
ale
give
it
a
try
if
you
live
for
malty
beers
after
its
release
from
330ml
brown
bottle
it
sets
in
the
glass
an
orangegold
color
with
a
modest
bright
white
heat
that
is
semicreamy
texture
the
lace
is
a
fine
coating
upon
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
malt
fresh
and
crisp
start
is
sweet
the
grain
profile
decent
top
is
light
to
moderate
in
feel
finish
has
a
determined
in
its
acidity
the
hops
pleasant
the
aftertaste
dry
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
bitterness
from
the
11
percent
abv
and
also
some
noticeable
tummy
warming
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
something
i
drink
on
a
regular
basis
drinkability
not
a
fan
of
the
flavor
nor
the
persistent
aftertaste
the
alcohol
is
quite
apparent
and
limits
consumption
a
completely
new
experience
in
beer
for
me
but
not
one
im
necessarily
looking
to
repeat
so
how
does
one
score
an
11
beer
in
this
case
quite
easily
have
you
tried
any
other
expensive
heavy
beers
this
really
makes
a
point
that
cost
does
not
need
to
be
high
to
get
some
very
luxurious
qualities
from
a
beer
essentially
eku
28
is
not
only
one
of
the
strongest
beers
in
the
world
and
a
world
classic
but
its
an
easy
drinking
concoction
its
smooth
sticky
and
heavy
like
a
port
but
not
quite
so
heavy
as
schamiclaus
15
or
other
super
heavy
weight
beers
it
smells
rich
and
goes
down
without
any
unpleasent
bite
or
after
taste
an
affordable
night
cap
106pack
or
a
good
value
for
the
abv
alone
not
as
complex
as
the
super
heavy
weights
but
fills
a
gap
mssing
in
the
6pack
motif
in
some
ways
this
is
about
as
drinkable
as
a
portly
beer
can
be
meaning
that
youll
be
tempted
to
grab
another
as
you
are
not
totally
exhausted
by
the
first
d
low
due
to
the
syrupyness
but
decent
again
a
great
apertif
would
go
great
with
pie
a
la
mode
with
11
abv
this
is
clearly
an
occasional
sipping
beer
not
one
to
drink
in
multiples
but
a
fine
indulgence
every
now
and
then
d
very
high
this
beer
is
a
delight
to
drink
the
real
only
drawback
is
the
11
abv
and
reason
it
keeps
me
from
drinking
more
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
which
is
why
it
can
be
dangerous
i
nearly
put
myself
in
a
coma
drinking
this
at
a
german
beerfest
one
year
its
addictive
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
decent
beer
nevertheless
musings
another
kickass
eisbock
a
great
cold
weather
brew
because
it
is
highly
warming
not
as
consistent
and
stable
from
a
malt
standpoint
as
the
aventinus
but
still
a
worthwhile
find
poured
into
an
eku
glass
a
deep
copper
to
light
amber
color
with
2
fingers
of
light
tan
head
over
top
that
is
maintained
by
a
solid
cascade
of
bubbles
from
the
bottom
very
good
clarity
as
well
nose
is
pretty
big
and
bold
on
this
very
syrupy
sweet
raisin
to
fig
fruityness
sits
over
a
light
puff
of
alcohol
and
light
candied
fruit
sweetness
as
well
lending
more
to
that
syrupy
or
processed
sugary
sweetness
i
like
it
flavor
is
not
quite
as
bold
as
the
nose
but
still
very
full
the
dark
fruity
notes
are
dominant
with
fig
coming
through
the
strongest
there
is
a
nice
toastyness
to
it
after
swallowing
followed
by
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
but
not
burn
not
something
i
could
drink
too
much
of
but
i
enjoy
it
feel
on
this
brew
is
beyond
thick
i
dont
even
think
syrupy
is
enough
to
describe
it
no
real
carbonation
is
detectable
to
break
that
incredible
thickness
up
its
too
much
for
me
in
the
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
just
okay
as
well
but
this
is
not
a
beer
to
be
pounded
its
enjoyable
but
a
once
in
a
while
treat
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
surypy
good
perfect
nightcapper
material
i
enjoyed
this
more
as
it
warmed
a
bit
if
i
get
really
beer
geeked
out
id
reccommend
this
around
55
degrees
or
thereabouts
pick
up
a
sixer
next
time
you
see
it
pour
amber
with
light
tan
head
some
lacing
aroma
maltfruity
and
alcohol
mouth
feel
was
slick
had
a
vanilla
alcohol
taste
did
not
care
for
this
one
at
the
time
i
had
this
i
thought
the
alcohol
was
a
little
too
much
for
me
i
will
rerate
this
a
a
later
date
but
for
now
did
not
care
for
this
this
is
a
bodywarming
beer
for
sipping
and
enjoying
and
would
be
an
excellent
companion
while
weathering
a
winter
storm
drinkability
i
would
drink
more
then
1
in
a
session
if
given
the
opportunity
but
its
a
potent
beer
at
11
abv
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
moreso
then
i
thought
i
would
a
little
sweet
and
sticky
for
my
taste
but
if
you
like
big
beers
give
this
a
try
taste
is
unbelievably
heady
with
sweet
malts
cherry
caramel
pleasantly
alcoholic
normally
this
might
be
a
bit
sweet
for
me
but
the
flavours
feel
so
well
balanced
i
can
overlook
that
feels
so
heavy
and
thick
in
the
mouth
creamy
but
not
soft
great
carbonation
if
this
wasnt
so
high
in
abv
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
tonight
this
is
one
classy
beer
and
if
this
is
indicative
of
the
style
bring
more
of
these
on
eh
the
other
eisbock
by
kulmbacher
is
better
this
to
me
was
a
bit
more
toned
down
on
the
tastesmell
catagory
its
just
not
as
pungent
as
the
other
sure
the
alcohol
is
friggin
strong
as
crap
which
is
cool
but
it
just
overpowered
the
taste
too
much
itll
definately
keep
you
warm
on
those
cold
winter
days
but
other
than
that
its
not
that
great
330
ml
bottle
with
some
code
on
the
back
served
lightly
chilled
in
a
snifter
it
pours
a
clear
rustybronze
color
with
a
1
finger
tan
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
but
recedes
to
nothing
by
the
end
the
aromas
are
sweet
fruit
caramel
toasted
malts
raisinsdark
fruits
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
a
lot
of
dried
banana
i
passed
it
to
my
sister
and
after
sniffing
the
first
word
she
said
was
banana
it
has
a
body
that
is
thick
and
smooth
and
banana
is
also
the
dominant
flavor
almost
like
banana
nut
bread
but
its
shadowed
by
a
sweetness
spices
chocolate
and
a
mild
bitterness
which
all
meld
nicely
not
terribly
complex
but
its
pretty
good
and
i
could
have
put
away
another
one
fairly
easily
i
had
another
bottle
of
this
when
i
was
in
heidelburg
and
wasnt
as
impressed
so
i
averaged
my
scores
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
carbonation
could
be
a
bit
lower
either
way
this
is
a
sipper
and
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
this
one
warms
you
up
nicely
and
lets
you
know
to
respect
the
abv
another
solid
offering
from
kulmbacher
sorry
my
review
isnt
as
specific
as
it
could
be
didnt
take
great
mental
notes
while
drinking
however
the
fact
remains
at
least
on
tap
this
one
is
nasty
stay
away
d
one
is
plenty
due
to
the
strong
flavors
and
very
apparent
alcoholic
content
savored
the
complexity
for
almost
an
hour
selection
from
beerofthemonth
club
shared
with
fellow
ba
mtanji
poured
a
deep
ruby
red
liquid
with
sparse
white
head
that
quickly
dissapeared
smell
is
very
heavy
malt
fruitiness
with
figs
gates
cherries
prunes
and
just
about
any
dark
fruit
you
can
think
of
present
distinct
alcohol
presence
as
would
be
expected
taste
is
sweet
and
syrupy
with
a
coatthemouth
feeling
malt
completely
takes
over
with
an
overripe
dark
fruit
alcohol
is
there
but
is
well
hidden
which
increases
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
definitely
a
slow
sipping
beer
because
as
it
warms
the
flavors
become
more
intense
would
make
an
great
after
dinner
drink
lemme
try
this
one
again
sometime
from
the
bottle
maybe
ill
have
more
positive
things
to
say
later
a
very
interesting
hard
to
define
selection
looking
for
something
different
this
is
it
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
sampled
to
date
pours
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
nice
carbonation
the
head
fades
quickly
no
lacing
at
all
scents
of
sweet
fruit
malt
nice
sweet
taste
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
behind
it
finishes
dry
and
sweet
medium
body
very
drinkable
sweet
but
not
to
sweet
alcohol
is
hidden
pretty
well
at
11
abv
would
recommend
uf
pours
a
clear
deep
amber
with
copper
hues
and
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
dissapates
almost
immediately
typical
strong
lager
appearance
aroma
is
intensely
sweet
with
caramel
brown
sugar
and
molasses
scents
as
well
as
some
toffee
and
a
light
floral
and
mineraly
hops
accent
plus
a
nice
alcohol
punch
flavor
is
similar
with
a
cloying
sweetness
that
distracts
from
other
characteristics
with
notes
of
honey
molasses
and
caramel
and
some
toasted
bread
floral
and
mineraly
hops
some
oaky
and
vanilla
flavors
some
slight
fruity
esters
and
a
moderate
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
extremely
sweet
and
one
dimensional
but
interesting
nonetheless
more
like
a
carbonated
liquor
than
a
beer
but
thats
ok
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sweet
finish
with
a
big
alcohol
punch
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
too
many
of
these
as
it
runs
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
though
the
toasted
graininess
is
very
kind
surprised
to
see
no
yeasts
in
the
bottle
prost
beertracker
d
this
has
good
complexity
for
a
high
alcohol
lager
the
dried
fruit
and
dark
malt
could
be
a
bit
more
complex
it
is
very
smooth
and
it
doesnt
taste
like
an
11
abv
but
the
malts
add
a
nice
balance
to
what
alcohol
you
do
taste
drank
at
the
local
german
bar
the
locals
thought
i
was
crazy
for
ordering
it
briliantly
clear
copperorange
color
with
golden
highlights
thrown
in
low
carbonation
and
lacing
but
nice
legging
on
the
glass
smells
sharply
sweet
alcoholic
and
estery
flavors
are
sweetly
malty
and
fruity
not
a
lot
of
different
flavors
but
the
ones
that
are
present
are
very
powerful
pruits
of
peaches
and
apricots
syrup
and
caramel
flavors
share
the
remaining
characters
low
on
spices
hops
and
robustness
smooth
and
silky
to
the
mouth
full
and
round
alcohol
warming
in
the
finish
just
slight
of
becoming
cloying
and
dry
a
good
beer
if
you
like
them
sweet
not
bad
but
too
sweet
for
me
the
high
abv
and
sweetness
would
make
this
an
ideal
apertif
beer
not
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
the
initials
e
k
u
indicate
in
german
the
first
united
brewery
of
kulmbach
which
was
once
labled
as
the
strongest
beer
in
the
world
with
an
og
of
28
in
german
degrees
eku
28
pours
crystalclear
orangeamber
with
a
brief
white
head
that
leaves
some
lace
aromas
of
malt
and
alcohol
flavor
is
rich
slightly
toasty
and
caramelkissed
likely
from
the
decoction
of
munich
malts
and
remind
one
of
fine
dopplebocks
like
celebrator
the
full
body
and
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
are
balanced
by
its
fine
bubbled
carbonation
high
abv
and
buried
hops
flavors
are
fairly
complex
and
evolve
with
warming
opinion
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
it
is
really
clean
with
a
lot
of
flavor
rich
melanoidins
and
caramel
malts
really
give
this
beer
backbone
i
believe
that
this
beer
will
really
age
well
and
would
be
accentuated
by
the
esters
gained
with
age
this
one
is
a
beautiful
bright
bronze
color
but
it
lacks
head
retention
and
contains
almost
no
visible
carbonation
at
all
the
nose
is
of
sweet
caramel
malts
very
caramelly
very
malty
the
taste
is
slick
and
smooth
heavy
on
the
liquid
caramel
finishing
with
something
a
little
sour
this
one
is
incredibly
oily
and
slick
the
label
says
11
abv
but
i
would
have
never
guessed
it
to
be
more
than
7
or
8
c
overall
this
eisbock
was
a
little
too
unbalanced
for
me
and
it
had
aged
for
9
months
i
much
prefer
kulmbacher
eisbock
and
aventinus
to
this
one

whatever
that
means
this
had
probably
been
in
the
fridge
two
years
they
boast
that
it
can
stand
in
for
shery
thats
pretty
bold
but
what
i
can
say
that
this
stuff
is
good
color
is
almost
burgandy
and
pouring
it
into
a
glass
produces
a
little
head
which
hung
around
for
a
bit
the
taste
of
malt
along
with
the
spices
pleasures
your
mouth
making
mouthfeel
and
taste
very
good
and
unique
drinkability
is
good
too
even
though
this
stuff
is
11
strong
because
while
you
drink
you
enjoy
its
unique
taste
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
yet
sweet
and
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
it
seems
rich
and
warm
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
and
rich
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
warm
on
the
way
down
it
has
a
very
sweet
crystal
malt
flavor
with
little
hop
characteristics
present
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
tastey
brew
it
has
excellent
malt
character
and
drinkability
on
tap
at
the
collins
bar
in
nyc
this
strong
brew
pours
a
glowingshimmering
shade
of
dark
leather
clear
with
an
off
white
minimal
head
well
developed
and
thickfrothy
lacing
nose
is
buttery
malt
and
alcohol
sweet
alcohol
this
is
a
pleasingly
bracing
beer
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
quite
evident
notes
of
juniper
smoke
more
butter
and
alcohol
warming
heady
stuff
cant
say
the
11
is
well
hidden
but
for
the
strong
livered
this
is
a
fine
sipper
eku
28
is
dark
caramel
copper
in
color
with
a
quickly
disappearing
head
the
overall
strength
of
the
aroma
is
very
intense
character
of
the
aroma
is
of
rich
dark
fruits
and
rich
bready
malts
no
alcohol
smell
is
noted
the
taste
is
also
very
rich
dark
fruity
tastes
and
intense
dark
malt
flavor
come
together
to
create
an
interesting
concoction
a
slight
alcohol
taste
is
noted
throughout
the
finish
is
probably
the
sweetest
part
of
the
sip
which
is
interesting
because
it
is
also
where
the
fruity
tastes
are
most
prominent
this
brew
is
so
rich
and
alcoholic
that
drinkability
suffers
some
but
one
or
two
in
an
evening
sounds
great
i
would
suggest
and
i
personally
do
pair
this
with
a
highland
park
18
y
o
single
malt
a
tasty
cousin
of
barleywine
this
can
fill
a
similiar
role
a
late
nightcap
with
some
stinky
cheese
mmm
call
it
malt
liqueur
a
fellow
brewclub
member
had
me
try
this
at
a
festival
over
the
weekend
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
very
strong
caramel
malt
character
i
like
the
heavy
malt
thing
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
lots
of
great
malty
goodness
with
a
caramel
character
also
some
slight
fruity
notes
and
a
kick
of
alcohol
the
alcohol
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
not
too
much
thick
body
makes
it
very
enjoyable
note
if
you
do
drink
this
beer
on
tap
let
it
sit
a
minute
a
slightly
warm
eku
28
is
a
happy
eku
28
ekus
rich
very
subtly
toasty
just
caramelkissed
and
honeysweet
malt
warms
to
fill
the
mouth
with
a
lush
wash
of
stickiness
thats
peppered
by
alcohol
and
spicy
hops
just
as
its
finebubbled
carbonation
breaks
on
the
tongue
with
a
light
zest
its
surprisingly
drinkable
given
its
full
body
and
high
alcohol
content
and
although
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
it
helps
to
thin
the
malt
sweetness
ultimately
helping
the
beer
more
than
it
hinders
it
unfortunately
it
does
limit
the
head
retention
and
its
short
cap
of
white
quickly
dissipates
above
its
crystalclear
orangeamber
body
the
nose
is
not
particularly
complex
revealing
its
rich
maltiness
and
a
waft
of
alcohol
but
its
flavor
becomes
a
bit
more
complex
as
it
warms
with
notes
of
vanilla
and
almonds
as
well
as
some
floral
hoppiness
in
addition
to
its
concentrated
munichmaltlike
graininess
at
the
very
least
its
quite
unique
among
beers
and
deserves
a
try
the
appearance
was
a
clear
amber
color
with
little
to
no
head
the
smell
was
somewhat
malty
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
or
something
tasted
almost
like
a
spiced
puerto
rican
rum
for
some
odd
reason
like
i
said
it
was
extremely
smooth
for
as
high
of
an
alcohol
content
as
it
has
i
would
highly
recommend
it
world
class
share
this
with
a
good
friend
or
two
drinkability
and
overall
the
of
style
of
this
beer
is
very
unique
ive
never
quite
had
anything
that
was
comparable
to
this
there
are
some
downsides
to
it
mainly
the
strong
alcohol
taste
makes
it
hard
to
drink
a
few
of
other
than
that
phenomenal
definitly
a
sipping
beer
and
one
that
has
to
be
tried

not

to
the

big

some

tastes
remniscent
of

sticky
mouth
this
brew
has
some
zip
the
pour
is
orange
gold
like
a
belgian
trippel
but
does
not
possess
the
signature
foamy
head
of
that
style
the
carbonation
is
lively
and
fizzy
but
not
a
head
to
be
seen
anywhere
the
aroma
is
perfumey

with
a
floral

the
taste
is
sweet
and
spicy
with
up

alcohol
and
an
assertive

bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
drying
with
a
strong
burn
at
the
back
of
the
throat
nice
and
drinkable
beer
but
lacks
the
roasty
complexity
of
a
good
dopplebock
or
the
subtle
hidden
punch
packed
by
a
belgian
trippel
for

not
something
to
drink
everyday
dark
carmel
color
with
excellent

retention
for
a
brew
this
strong
smell
is
sharp
with
alcohol
and
a
little
bit
of
cereal
malts
flavor
is
off
the
wall
with
alcohol
this
is
definitely
a
warming
sipper
of
a
beer
which
feels
a
little
off
in
air
conditioning
i
had
to
edit
my
review
because
this
was
a
little
bit
off
to
me
at
first
but
by
about
halfway
through
the
glass
it
was
very
good
an
intense
eisenbock
probably
too
much
for
most
but
those
that
seek
this
stuff
out
know
to
expect
a
powerful
brew
based
on
that
i
give
a
high
drinkability
score
mmm
this
is
a
good
brew
appearance
is
average
medium
gold
with
no
head
smell
is
a
beautiful
bouquet
of
fruity
scents
which
are
rich
and
invite
you
to
drink
more
taste
is
mallty
fruity
and
lets
you
know
it
has
an
alcohol
kick
mouthfeel
is
thick
as
expected
but
rich
in
feel
for
an
11
abv
this
is
very
drinkable
but
remember
to
sip
highly
recommended
overall
somewhat
cloying
that
coupled
with
the
thick
body
kept
this
beer
from
going
down
smoothly
has
a
clean
slightly
dark
orange
color
with
a
small
light
brown
head
which
dissapears
quickly
a
fruity
yeasty
aroma
mixes
with
a
strong
alcohol
presence
the
flavor
was
fruity
with
a
hint
of
cherry
followed
by
a
strong
alcohol
warmth
and
finishes
with
a
light
nutty
hazelnut
touch
at
the
back
of
your
tongue
this
lager
has
barlywine
like
characteristics
a
little
or
no
carbonation
which
also
leaves
you
with
no
head
b
a
very
serious
alcohol
presence
this
one
is
for
sipping
not
gulping
it
says
on
the
bottle
the
one
whenever
something
good
and
strong
is
needed
it
certainly
lives
up
to
that
billing
i
love
this
eisbock
style
i
only
wish
more
american
brewers
would
give
it
a
chance
lots
of
malty
sweetness
here
with
flavors
of
caramel
estery
fruityness
oak
licorice
and
toffee
slight
cherry
tartness
offsets
the
sweetness
for
about
a
second
but
it
doesnt
really
do
much
the
most
noticeable
flavor
is
the
fussel
alcohol
that
comes
through
in
the
finish
its
strong
but
i
like
it
the
sweetness
meshes
well
with
the
alcohol
give
me
another
the
head
disappeared
immediately
the
body
is
like
strawberry
syrup
transparent
and
red
with
a
few
bubbles
inthe
middle
which
reminded
me
of
a
vulcano
the
smell
is
ok
hard
to
describe
maybe
fruity
with
some
caramel
the
first
impression
in
the
taste
is
good
sweet
and
fruity
but
then
the
alcool
comes
and
its
kind
of
nasty
it
tastes
like
martini
with
the
same
plain
bitterness
and
also
like
some
fruit
liquors
too
strong
the
mouthfeel
is
winy
and
boring
i
didnt
finish
my
glass
light
bodied
yet
carmelly
sweet
like
a
barley
wine
this
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
yet
high
in
alcohol
smooth
flavor
but
little
else
to
comment
on
no
off
flavors
just
smooth
and
sweet
everything
has
its
purpose
and
this
beers
is
to
deliver
thick
wellconceived
malt
sweetness
to
those
who
crave
it
now
that
means
just
what
it
says
but
if
thats
your
goal
then
this
beer
will
rise
to
the
occasion
its
not
about
balance
but
then
it
never
pretends
to
be
the
highoctane
abv
will
put
a
serious
hurt
on
ones
unguarded
sobriety
and
fast
so
its
not
something
youd
want
to
lose
track
of
in
spite
of
how
nicely
warming
it
is
but
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
what
this
offers
itll
give
you
the
malted
fix
youre
looking
for
a
smoky
sweetness
envelops
the
mouth
at
first
followed
by
a
tropical
fruit
sweetness
that
lingers
into
a
finish
that
gives
just
the
hint
of
hops
alcohol
is
masked
nicely
and
beer
is
very
smooth
pours
a
clear
reddish
orange
hue
under
a
two
finger
off
white
head
that
settles
fairly
quickly
producing
an
amazingly
loud
popping
bubbles
sound
the
head
has
some
body
at
first
but
produces
no
lace
when
cold
the
nose
is
very
very
subdued
but
it
blossoms
incredibly
as
the
beer
warms
resulting
in
a
strong
caramel
and
maple
syrup
scent
the
mouth
is
very
prickly
and
quite
heavy
the
taste
is
sweet
caramel
and
lots
of
it
with
a
barley
background
and
significant
alcohol
theres
no
hoppy
bitterness
at
all
with
the
bite
coming
completely
from
the
alcohol
the
aftertaste
is
sweet
like
supercharged
candy
this
is
an
interesting
brew
but
it
would
be
in
my
regular
repertoire
incidentally
michael
jackson
calls
this
a
strong
lagerdouble
bock
pale
to
medium
amber
color
head
is
small
smell
is
of
strong
alcohol
like
wine
taste
follows
the
high
abv
of
11
strong
alchohol
at
first
i
took
large
tastes
but
realized
it
is
better
sipped
given
the
fruity
wine
flavor
i
finished
the
bottle
but
dont
think
i
will
be
buying
another
this
was
my
first
try
at
a
really
strong
ale
and
i
think
i
will
stick
to
others
drinkability
ummm
im
almost
curious
to
see
what
might
happen
this
beer
is
serious
its
as
if
no
attempt
is
made
to
cover
the
large
abv
in
this
beer
i
like
that
and
it
adds
to
the
character
but
in
all
honesty
i
couldnt
have
another
even
if
i
wanted
to
this
would
be
the
best
nightcap
ever
if
you
could
find
a
chap
willing
to
split
it
with
you
its
a
bruiser
for
sure
sampled
122003
a
very
interesting
eisbock
with
a
superior
and
highly
complex
taste
low
drinkability
as
this
is
much
more
like
a
liquore
than
a
beer
ideal
for
sipping
in
front
of
the
fireplace
on
a
cold
winter
night
out
of
a
brandy
snifter
pours
an
orange
amber
with
a
miniscule
head
that
quickly
settles
smells
of
strong
sweetness
and
alcohol
mohogany
caramel
with
prune
notes
and
kindof
an
oakey
quality
in
my
opinion
taste
is
overbearing
on
the
sweetness
enjoyable
but
somewhat
like
very
alcoholic
candy
bitterness
takes
its
roll
only
in
the
aftertaste
and
dies
out
submitting
to
the
alcoholic
sweetness
a
good
brew
but
definitely
a
desert
beer
and
should
be
expected
as
such
the
bar
tender
told
me
up
front
there
was
no
returns
and
not
to
puke
in
the
bar
lol
i
finished
off
the
whole
stein
and
was
ready
for
more
definitely
a
beer
to
try
if
you
have
the
chance
the
high
abv
is
hidden
pretty
well
and
it
makes
this
a
enjoyable
beer
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pretty
deep
gold
color
the
head
is
almost
nonexistant
but
shows
a
tan
color
when
roused
from
the
glass
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
strong
malt
the
thick
malt
overwhelms
everything
feels
quite
thick
on
the
tongue
surprisingly
given
the
body
it
is
not
really
all
that
sweet
this
is
a
thick
chewy
malty
brew
the
malt
character
is
the
show
here
though
having
said
that
this
beer
is
lacking
a
bit
it
is
missing
some
of
the
malt
complexity
of
a
good
strong
lager
this
is
a
nice
clean
lager
it
is
almost
syrupy
in
consistency
in
the
end
a
bit
dissapointing
needs
a
bit
more
character
to
be
really
worth
drinking
i
love
this
beer
and
would
drink
cases
of
it
if
i
could
i
doubt
i
could
afford
such
a
habit
i
will
definitely
try
this
beer
again
i
cant
wait
to
sample
more
of
this
style
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
and
alcohol
attacks
the
tongue
the
thick
malt
sticks
to
your
tongue
for
a
while
after
swallowing
hard
time
finsihing
one
of
these
not
very
drinkable
unless
you
like
a
very
sweet
and
alcohol
laced
brew
drinkability

well
if
you
dont
like
the
style
than
you
wont
like
this
bottle
but
if
you
can
appreciate
the
high
alcohol
and
incredible
smoothness
that
results
from
icing
a
bock
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings

this
is
an
excellent
dark
reddishbrownish
colour
with
a
lovely
white
head
of
foam
that
dies
quickly
the
aromas
are
of
sweet
heavily
alcoholic
malts
and
slight
hops
on
the
finish
and
the
taste
is
quite
boozy
malty
and
a
bit
hoppy
on
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
cloying
as
it
is
so
thick
and
creamy
the
drinkability
is
excellent
as
well
even
for
an
11abv
beer
drinkability
interesting
but
i
would
never
bother
drinking
it
again
pours
a
paler
copper
color
with
virtually
no
head
whatever
just
remnants
of
a
thin
white
head
smells
of
strong
grain
some
lingering
smokiness
peatiness
and
fruitiness
like
a
ripe
banana
injected
with
grain
alcohol
swimming
in
rumraisin
sipping
and
i
recommend
sipping
this
beer
reveals
a
big
alcohol
punch
almost
whiskey
or
scotchish
with
some
husky
cerealness
backing
it
up
and
not
so
much
hops
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
luxurious
a
heavy
bodied
beer
with
all
the
bells
and
whistles
that
suggest
so
quite
enjoyable
could
never
drink
these
back
to
back
unless
i
was
on
a
plane
carrying
it
going
down
in
the
polar
or
antarctic
regions
of
the
globe
id
take
two
but
no
more
the
light
amber
color
of
this
beer
belies
its
potency
the
coffee
colored
head
is
nothing
exceptional
but
beginning
with
the
aroma
this
beer
takes
off
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
citrusy
with
traces
of
figs
apples
toffee
and
alcohol
it
has
a
complex
mouthfeel
that
is
thick
syrupy
and
oily
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
alcohol
toffee
and
figs
with
just
a
little
bitterness
the
finish
is
sweet
and
a
little
chewey
its
high
alcohol
content
makes
this
a
good
cold
night
beer
to
relax
around
the
house
with
wow
one
at
a
time
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
about
as
strong
and
warming
as
you
can
get
theres
just
not
much
chance
of
getting
through
more
than
that
if
someone
tells
you
that
lagers
are
lightweight
and
for
pansies
then
by
all
means
hand
them
a
bottle
of
this
a
fantastic
beer
and
one
id
likely
have
again
especially
in
a
warming
situation
potent
biscuit
malt
aroma
thick
cream
colored
head
glowing
light
amber
brown
beer
with
lots
of
little
floaties
sweet
butterscotch
and
malty
flavor
a
bit
like
a
malt
ball
the
body
is
slick
and
sweet
i
would
expect
an
eisbock
to
be
a
little
lighter
in
the
body
but
what
do
i
know
not
a
big
fan
of
the
flavor
or
the
way
it
coats
your
tongue
not
horrible
just
not
up
my
alley
pours
a
clear
brilliant
red
with
a
medium
tan
head
that
quickly
diminishes
to
a
small
ring
lace
is
nonexistent
aroma
is
mainly
alcohol
somewhat
whiskeylike
some
maple
syrup
slightly
buttery
flavor
is
cloying
sweetness
colbbered
by
over
the
top
alcohol
this
basically
reminded
me
of
alcoholic
syrup
or
something
not
all
that
enjoyable
appearance
copper
amber
with
a
thin
bubbly
head
cream
in
color
not
much
lacing
the
alcohol
prettty
much
kills
everything
here
aroma
strong
alcohol
layered
with
sugary
syupy
and
mild
plum
brandy
notes
this
is
definitely
kicked
up
a
few
notches
in
the
alcohol
department
if
ab
only
knew
how
to
make
an
ice
beer
taste
is
basically
like
sipping
down
some
liquor
doesnt
burn
but
the
alcohol
flavor
is
so
rich
and
complex
with
the
sugar
malts
this
beer
is
crazy
wow
this
is
a
beer
i
will
bring
to
my
next
cold
football
game
i
go
to
damn
its
very
warming
going
down
the
alcohol
doesnt
even
try
to
hide
itself
here
its
in
your
face
competely
mouthfeel
medium
to
full
with
syrupy
like
texture
wow
drinkability
becareful
not
a
beer
to
be
chugged
or
drank
fast
take
your
time
let
it
warm
up
along
the
way

orangish
reddish

color
not
much
of
a
head
but
a
thin
collar
hangs
around
very
sweet
alcoholic
fruity
nose
not
bad
at
all
just
really
sweet
i
like
it
the
first
sip
reveals
a
very
strong
alcohol
presence
a
bit
of
a
medicinal
note
in
there
as
well
alcohol
warms
the
esophagus
as
you
swallow
residual
sweetness
is
pretty
high
on
this
one
a
slight
hint
of
bitterness
slips
in
after
a
few
sips
but
it
is
dissolved
by
the
alcohol
i
think
this
needs
to
age
for
a
few
years
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
this
is
almost
like
a
marzen
or
maibock
diluted
with
spirits
definitely
not
for
the
weak
now
the
question
is
how
long
will
it
take
to
finish
this
one
not
a
bad
beer
but
nowhere
near
a
session
brew
you
will
know
this
is
a
high
abv
offering
and
you
will
most
likely
enjoy
it
slowly
when
i
poured
this
beer
i
was
very
excited
for
my
first
sip
it
pours
a
beautiful
deep
orange
color
with
a
medium
sized
head
that
held
shape
for
no
time
at
all
after
noticing
the
11
abv
on
the
label
i
knew
that
the
first
sip
could
tell
me
a
lot
about
the
beer
here
goes
nothing
pure
alcohol
just
like
the
label
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
says
treated
like
a
fine
port
this
was
a
different
taste
for
an
eisbock
as
it
warmed
up
i
began
to
enjoy
it
much
the
flavors
began
to
come
out
and
weaken
the
alcohol
taste
overall
and
some
notes
of
rum
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
thick

tasting
this
beer
i
had
to
check
again
to
make
sure
it
was
really
from
germany
could
they
possibly
make
this
sweet
nectar
in
adherence
to
the

this
beer
is
absolutely
unique
among
all
the
german
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
in

with
moderate

the
drinkability
was
ok

something

some

that

i
just
didnt
care
for

the
first
sip
almost
knocked
me
out
of
my
chair
what
a
drink
a
huge
buttery
malt
but
i
dont
think
diacetyl
floods
the
mouth
and
was
balanced
not
by
hops

by
an

the
tongue
was
left
tingling
for
much
of
the
moderately

salty

hops
were
minimal
at

kinda

crowning
the

head

alright
but
lacing
is
a
nonentity
not
a
huge
hang
up
for
me
given
the
style
though
the
nose
doesnt
come
through
super
well
but
what
is
there
is
solid
its
a
roughly
5050
blend
of
plum

fig
fruitiness
and
rich

the
flavor
is
a

chocolate
that
give
the
beer
a
greater
depth
of
flavor
the
carbontion
is
nice
and
low
it
keeps
out
of
the
way
of
the
malts
the
body
though
just
isnt
full
and
rich
enough
for
such
a
big
malty
beer
sled
dog
is
a
solid
doppelbock
and
one
that
i
would
certainly
drink
again
i
dont
think
id
seek
it
out
though
taste
was
what
really
matters
to
me
and
it
had
a
really
pleasant
feel
in
the
mouth
and
a
nice
flavor
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
mild
spice
i
kinda
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
stout
lite
not
meant
to
be
a
negative
comment
it
was
real
smooth
yet
a
little
thick
and
malty
if
ya
never
had
i
suggest
ya
try
it
o
a
fine
example
of
a
dopplebock
plenty
of
interest
and
good
intensity
notes
its
not
the
most
complex
doppelbock
but
there
is
something
about
its
basic
character
that
i
like
and
find
enjoyable
to
drink
this
is
my
first
taste
of
wagner
valley
vineyards
and
im
duly
blown
away
i
like
the
label
although
i
like
the
packaging
for
their
ipa
slightly
better
pours
smooth
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
struggling
off
white
head
either
because
of
the
alcohol
or
more
likely
from
my
glass
huge
malty
sweet
brown
sugar
aroma
that
is
impossible
to
avoid
the
flavor
is
not
overcomplicated
45
flavors
that
are
used
well
brown
sugar
malt
prune
and
i
swear
something
like
a
ripe
apple
in
the
back
end
but
maybe
another
ripe
fruit
would
be
more
appropriate
to
describe
it
lets
say
asian
pear
to
be
really
fancy
the
mouth
feel
is
silky
with
a
medium
to
full
body
the
finish
lingers
for
what
seems
like
hours
if
there
are
hops
detectable
it
is
only
slight
and
maybe
in
the
finish
but
balanced
beautifully
my
only
concern
is
maybe
a
tad
too
carbonated
and
in
all
fairness
maybe
i
served
it
slightly
warm
but
it
did
foam
up
a
bit
on
initial
taste
however
this
is
nitpicking
and
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
unnecessary
overall
although
not
a
spectacular
beer
i
found
the
drinkability
to
be
quite
high
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
it
seemed
like
the
beer
was
gone
in
a
flash
not
sure
id
seek
it
out
again
but
im
curious
to
try
some
of
the
other
wagner
valley
offerings
d
sweet
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
no
prob
let
it
come
up
in
temp
poured
clear
and
reddishbrown
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
or
abv
on
label
the
head
was
thin
and
disappeared
quickly
aroma
is
hard
to
describe
more
like
molasses
mixed
with
wheat
husk
mixed
with
some
hard
sugar
candy
taste
is
a
mix
of
malts
tart
and
sweet
fruitiness
the
abv
slowly
takes
over
after
a
few
sips
mouth
feel
is
good
decent
lacing
indeed
a
different
double
bock
beer
very
complex
and
is
definitely
worth
a
try
wagner
valley
sled
dog
doppelbock
is
a
very
clear
ruby
lager
thats
topped
with
a
khaki
ring
that
leaves
decent
lacing
it
smells
sweet
melanoidal
and
grainy
its
full
bodied
and
syrupy
with
a
dry
chewy
finish
it
tastes
slightly
sweet
and
bready
alcohol
is
present
in
the
finish
it
has
a
slightly
medicinal
bitterness
its
a
solid
doppelbock
heavy
thick
sweet
flavor
candied
fruit
comes
to
mind
not
a
session
beer
but
makes
for
a
nice
slow
sipping
drink
d
the
big
plus
to
this
beer
was
the
clean
mouthfeel
taste
isnt
anything
spectacular
but
it
is
worth
trying
its
a
good
alternative
if
you
want
a
refreshing
doppelbock
rather
than
a
heavier
one
even
mouthfeel
finishes
tingly
fairly
full
tasty
and
drinkable
this
beer
is
syrupy
in
the
mouth
with
a
small
brisk
carbonation
it
is
a
very
inviting
beer
that
is
easier
on
the
palate
than
its
abv
suggests
this
is
a
winter
beer
all
the
way
d
the
bockbier
doesnt
feel
like
an
8
5
ringer
the
bready
base
that
improves
over
time
d
one
thing
i
noticed
was
a
wicked
alcohol
kick
didnt
realize
this
brew
comes
in
at
over
8
my
first
wagner
brew
didnt
have
many
expectations
but
this
is
definitely
a
great
beer
a
nice
warming
interpretation
of
the
style
pretty
good
dopplebock
in
my
opinion
poured
it
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
has
an
amberbrown
color
that
has
good
clarity
to
it
it
had
a
cray
slightly
orangey
creamy
colored
head
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
looking
beer
the
smell
is
good
very
sweet
mostly
compiled
of
sweet
malts
and
dark
fruits
has
a
sweet
toffee
type
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
also
pretty
sweet
has
all
the
characteristics
of
the
smell
maybe
a
little
heavier
on
the
darker
fruits
and
has
an
aftertaste
of
butterscotch
i
thought
that
you
couldnt
taste
the
hops
at
all
until
about
a
minute
after
one
of
the
sips
its
feint
but
present
the
mouthfeel
is
really
good
too
pretty
creamy
and
smooth
reasonably
full
bodied
only
a
slight
bitter
bite
from
the
hops
more
like
a
little
pinch
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
pretty
drinkable
beer
of
this
style
nice
sipper
on
a
winter
night
i
really
enjoied
this
beer
it
is
an
excellent
doppelbock
that
is
great
for
cold
nights
with
a
rich
bowl
of
beef
stew
reviewed
on

bottle
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
with
a
small
tan
head
aroma
of
vegetal
notes
bready
malt
toffee
flavor
of
bready
malt
some
cola
notes
wow
this
is
the
same
beer
as
the
amber
lager
maybe
a
little
better
it
hardly
matters
really
pretty
lackluster
overall
starts
off
underwhelming
didnt
even
tip
the
glass
when
i
poured
and
it
didnt
really
come
close
to
overflowing
in
other
words
very
weak
head
and
little
lacing
however
the
smell
is
big
and
malty
with
sweet
caramel
and
dried
fruit
dominating
the
taste
is
pure
doppelbock
bready
malt
caramel
nuts
and
dark
fruit
with
a
bit
of
a
sharp
bitter
aftertaste
i
really
liked
this
one
and
the
cherry
on
top
it
was
brewed
just
twenty
minutes
from
where
i
grew
up
in
the
seneca
lake
i
havent
had
too
many
dopplebocks
to
compare
this
too
so
ill
keep
it
short
this
beer
has
a
great
flavor
it
was
dark
but
not
cloudy
and
the
head
hung
around
long
enough
for
me
to
finish
the
beer
the
smell
was
nice
and
it
didnt
sit
to
heavy
on
the
palate
as
for
drinkability
well
it
went
down
good
and
the
crowd
of
people
that
were
half
in
the
bag
would
agree
with
me
overall
a
solid
example
of
the
style
nothing
earth
shattering
but
it
does
its
job
i
would
not
turn
it
down
the
drink
is
silkysmooth
and
on
the
lighter
end
of
the
mediumbodied
spectrum
carbonation
is
quite
mild
and
the
brew
is
plenty
drinkable
thanks
to
lum
for
the
bottle
drinkability
a
good
solid
tasty
example
of
the
style
that
fits
the
style
very
well
id
drink
more
for
sure
i
guess
were
trying
the
whole
wagner
valley
line
here
this
one
pours
a
clear
amber
brown
with
minimal
head
nose
is
malty
and
sweet
flavor
is
pretty
nice
seems
like
a
touch
of
apple
tones
smooth
feel
overall
nice
to
drink
not
too
shabby
really
d
drinkability
is
nice
and
this
one
goes
down
pretty
easily
the
flavors
are
a
good
but
the
aroma
and
feel
is
a
bit
off
this
is
still
drinkable
and
it
would
be
a
good
session
beer
except
for
the
supposed
abv
is
this
thing
really
8
5
i
mean
really
this
doesnt
even
seem
like
its
close
crazy
good
beer
but
not
the
greatest
doppelbock
date
consumed
29
june
2008
this
is
my
first
brew
from
wagner
valley
its
not
a
great
doppelbock
but
its
solid
enough
to
give
a
try
i
could
see
myself
picking
up
a
sixer
each
year
to
drink
on
these
cold
evenings
thanks
israel
big
bodied
a
bit
filling
and
a
thick
and
heavy
feel
really
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
fall
evening
i
could
not
drink
another
anytime
soon
though
very
drinkable
but
only
just
one
its
strong
and
malty
and
one
should
do
you
for
the
evening
you
can
buy
these
at
the
brewery
and
i
have
a
few
bottles
that
ive
picked
up
for
pretty
cheap
for
1
45
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
beer
of
this
quality
at
a
bar
a
syrupy
caramel
appearance
with
no
head
lowered
the
appearance
score
for
this
brew
smell
was
disappointing
alcohol
but
with
a
subdued
malt
taste
belied
the
smell
it
was
rich
malty
syrupy
tongue
coating
mouthfeel
was
excellent
extremely
smooth
drinkability
for
the
high
abv
was
good
easy
on
the
palate
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
a
good
sipping
and
relaxing
beer
deep
copper
color
and
tan
head
didnt
leave
much
lace
though
sharp
carbination
the
aromas
of
rasins
are
mixed
in
to
a
nice
blend
of
caramel
and
bread
aromas
malty
rasiny
tart
flavor
up
front
slight
roast
turns
phenolic
in
the
end
seems
a
little
bitter
for
th
style
light
mouthfeel
and
dries
out
nicely
a
good
beer
dark
thin
head
dark
amber
in
color
bready
smell
nice
malty
taste
and
it
is
very
smooth
not
very
complex
in
taste
imo
since
all
i
get
is
the
malt
backbone
not
very
boozy
for
8
5
and
it
is
very
drinkable
i
am
a
fan
of
the
style
this
is
a
good
doppelbock
cheers
overall
a
tasty
and
relatively
complex
doppelbock
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
from
the
smell
theres
a
definite
bready
malty
syrupy
thickness
to
this
brew
but
theres
some
buttery
sour
tart
cheese
notes
in
there
that
is
offputting
a
little
too
dairy
for
me
you
can
definatly
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
kinda
interesting
tastes
of
grapes
and
raisens
but
not
too
much
complexity
pours
amber
brown
in
color
clear
a
very
small
light
tan
head
hesitates
then
surfaces
before
quickly
fading
to
nothing
aroma
is
sweet
maltiness
and
fruits
some
strong
melon
aroma
with
some
cherry
and
darker
fruit
as
well
taste
shows
a
hint
of
the
fruit
but
is
overwhelmingly
a
sweet
malt
powder
taste
mouthfeel
is
medium
slightly
thinner
than
i
expected
from
the
aroma
or
maybe
its
just
my
perception
from
the
low
levels
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
taste
just
a
gentle
warmth
and
somewhat
drying
finish
lets
you
know
its
there
overall
not
a
bad
doppelbock
the
taste
was
a
little
to
straight
up
carnation
malted
milk
for
me
i
could
have
used
some
other
flavors
to
mingle
with
the
sweetness
no
problem
finishing
the
beer
however
d
very
good
dopplebock
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
plenty
of
complexity
to
keep
it
interesting
poured
into
my
hennepin
glass
a
rough
pour
produces
a
34
inch
head
that
quickly
settles
into
a
8th
inch
thin
film
the
smell
is
malty
cola
with
butterscotch
and
floral
notes
the
beer
is
a
deep
mahogany
with
reddish
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
in
having
a
deep
roasted
malt
character
along
with
that
butterscotch
twist
very
light
gummy
bear
and
floral
hops
add
an
edge
to
the
overwhelming
maltiness
in
the
aftertaste
there
is
a
nice
nutty
taste
that
i
enjoy
in
belgians
and
american
and
english
brown
ales
the
alcohol
is
also
covered
up
very
well
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
from
what
i
remember
i
didnt
pay
too
much
for
it
guess
i
better
pick
up
a
sixer
next
time
im
out
finishes
with
more
alcohol
not
something
i
would
revisit
this
dopplebock
pours
a
clear
mahogany
hue
with
a
thin
khaki
colored
head
lacing
is
very
minimal
with
very
little
stickiness
smell
is
a
woody
malt
with
a
very
subtle
alcohol
tingle
on
the
nose
smell
also
carries
a
nice
brown
sugarmolases
hint
to
it
taste
is
well
done
powerful
malt
presence
that
is
quite
sweetsugary
a
creamybread
flavor
appears
a
bit
in
the
aftertaste
that
is
actually
quite
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
the
only
real
issue
i
had
with
this
beer
was
the
complete
absence
of
hops
which
takes
away
from
its
balance
alcohol
isnt
present
which
makes
this
quite
drinkable
for
an
8
5
abv
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
your
bocks
so
yeah
id
drink
em
a
lot
of
em
i
suppose
ha
and
this
stuff
is
local
and
inexpensive
heck
if
i
didnt
homebrew
so
much
id
drink
a
lot
more
of
this
stuff
when
i
think
of
this
style
of
beer
i
think
of
ayinger
celebrator
or
spaten
optiomator
this
beer
is
not
even
close
pours
amber
brown
not
much
headand
minimal

is
weakbut
boozy
some
dark

this
beer
is
not
awfulbut
not
a
good
representation
of
this
style
on
tap
at
the
pizza
plant
on
mainpoured
a
deep
crimson
color
with
a
touch
of
brownish
tint
a
tight
12
finger
white
head
atop
aromas
of
dark
fruit
soaked
in
alcohol
mainly
prune
and
raisin
a
faint
roasted
nut
quality
showed
itself
as
well
but
it
was
faint
deeply
malty
to
be
expected
with
brown
sugar
and
raisin
being
dominant
a
touch
of
earthylike
unsweetened
chocolate
shows
itself
in
the
finish
and
the
alcohol
becomes
more
prevelant
as
it
sits
a
bigger
malt
bomb
somewhat
sweet
and
quite
sustainingwell
made
in
my
opinion
cheers
pours
medium
brownishreddish
with
light
carbonation
a
little
flat
tiny
bit
o
lacing
smells
of
light
malts
light
caramels
and
a
little
funk
the
funk
also
is
noticeable
in
the
taste
which
ruins
it
a
bit
for
me
i
like
higher
abv
beers
and
even
the
ones
that
taste
like
alkie
but
this
one
was
funky
maybe
it
went
sorta
bad
in
the
bottle
overall
i
think
this
one
is
better
fresh
drinkability
decently
drinkable
considering
the
abv
i
could
see
this
being
quite
dangerous
a
pretty
solid
doppel
here
favorable
in
much
of
its
character
and
beery
aspects
drinks
down
pretty
quickly
as
the
body
is
easily
gliding
in
a
nonsticky
creamyness
and
silken
maltyness
of
sweetness
could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
no
prob
somewhat
syrupy
this
whole
beer
just
screams
thickness
remains
on
the
palate
for
a
few
minutes
afterward
have
to
sip
this
one
due
to
its
thickness
i
will
now
drink
one
for
every
variation
of
the
word
thick
in
this
review
the
beer
is
heavy
on
the
palate
with
light
carbonation
there
isnt
all
that
that
is
special
about
this
beer
infact
each
of
these
beers
from
wagner
valley
has
been
soso
not
really
great
but
not
bad
either
i
probably
wont
buy
this
again
just
because
i
want
to
try
other
doppelbocks
overall
not
a
bad
beer
if
i
wanted
a
doppelbock
and
this
was
the
only
one
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
buying
this
again
d
fantastic
i
could
drink
this
everyday
it
is
a
bit
sweet
but
an
ideal
dessert
beer
would
go
perfectly
with
unspiced
meat
dishes
particularly
lamb
this
is
an
awesome
brew
a
couple
of
these
will
make
you
feel
really
good
i
last
had
it
at
their
brewery
on
seneca
lake
near
ithaca
ny
about
7
months
ago
but
i
dont
get
the
pleasure
of
drinking
this
beer
as
often
as
id
like
the
brewery
is
also
a
vineyard
and
it
is
situated
on
one
of
the
most
beautiful
pieces
of
land
ive
ever
seen
they
have
a
huge
outdoor
deck
where
you
can
sit
and
drink
pitchers
or
pints
of
their
beers
while
looking
across
and
up
and
down
the
lake
it
seems
like
you
can
see
for
50
miles
in
every
direction
the
sky
seems
to
go
on
forever
im
thinking
about
that
view
as
i
taste
this
and
im
dreaming
of
going
back
this
summer
and
hopefully
sharing
a
pitcher
of
this
with
a
friend
i
suggest
you
do
the
same
and
certainly
try
this
if
you
can
find
it
drinkability
decently
drinkable
overall
a
slightly
above
average
doppelbock
i
dont
know
if
it
was
the
freshness
or
an
evolution
of
the
recipe
but
it
is
a
bit
better
in
my
latest
tasting
pours
a
deep
red
color
and
creates
a
minor
head
smell
is
malty
the
taste
has
a
strong
cherry
aftertaste
and
the
malt
is
very
prevalent
in
this
there
is
also
there
is
a
warm
kick
to
it
mouth
feel
could
be
described
as
slick
or
oily
with
little
carbonation
i
overheard
a
employee
of
a
local
beer
store
recommending
this
one
so
i
decided
to
pick
it
up
in
my
option
it
was
a
bad
call
small
dense
light
brown
colored
head
fades
quickly
to
a
ring
glowing
mahogany
colored
beer
with
a
ruby
hue
faint
aroma
of
sweet
caramal
malt
and
a
bit
of
grainy
burnt
malt
moderately
thick
beer
with
a
smooth
almost
slick
mouthfeel
mildly
sweet
caramel
and
dough
flavors
up
front
theres
a
sort
of
cherry
flavor
that
kicks
in
towards
then
and
it
all
fades
as
the
alcohol
warms
your
stomach
in
the
finish
i
bought
this
out
of
the
cooler
at
the
brewery
just
over
a
week
ago
so
i
doubt
its
old
theres
something
just
not
right
about
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
takes
a
wacky
turn
towards
cherry
cough
syrup
disappoinnting
to
say
the
least
on
the
whole
this
was
completely
nondescript
and
uncomely
i
had
hoped
for
more
when
i
first
picked
this
bottle
up
in
albany
ny
i
sampled
a
12
ounce
bottle
couldnt
find
any
freshness
dating
bottle
openend
without
any
gaseous
release
and
poured
w
a
minimal
tan
head
and
light
lacing
left
behind
low
carbonation
but
not
flat
faint
sweat
malty
nose
lighter
bodied
db
notes
of
plums
berries
maple
and
caramel
sweet
throughout
no
hop
presencebitterness
this
is
a
pleasant
dark
wintery
quaffer
would
go
well
with
hearty
winter
fare
stews
roasts
etc
the
brew
pours
a
clear
mahogany
with
some
garnet
tints
as
well
a
quickly
dissipating
thin
layer
of
beige
colored
head
foams
up
quickly
and
is
gone
aroma
is
chocolate
rich
ripe
plums
and
pears
raisins
and
maple
syrup
quite
enticing
aroma
i
think
first
sip
reveals
a
fairly
thick
body
almost
chewy
with
next
to
nonexistant
carbonation
very
smooth
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
witha
mix
of
chocolate
red
grapes
toffee
and
dark
fruit
very
rich
and
lingering
syrupy
sweet
palate
coating
finish
quite
enjoyable
brew
thanks
to
francisweizen
for
this
one
12
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
hard
pour
generated
a
couple
bubbles
but
no
head
over
a
somewhat
cloudy
brown
liquid
had
a
reddish
tinge
when
held
to
light
smells
of
caramel
chocolate
and
alcohol
bock
character
is
present
but
much
more
subdued
than
i
was
expecting
tastes
sweet
with
noticable
alochol
this
beer
is
thick
sweet
and
lightly
not
carbonated
some
bock
character
is
present
as
is
a
hint
of
chocloate
andor
roasted
grains
an
acceptable
doppel
wheres
the
carbonation
sled
dog
will
never
become
lead
dog
or
win
glory
in
the
doppelbock
version
of
the
iditarod
to
stretch
this
metaphor
to
the
absolute
breaking
point
but
hes
a
good
hound
all
the
same
the
world
needs
those
competent
plodders
who
get
by
on
sheer
force
of
will
alone
this
one
will
not
let
you
down
if
you
give
him
a
chance
a
decent
brew
and
solid
winter
warmer
but
a
lackluster
doppelbock
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
nearly
nonexistent
head
but
great
color
taste
matches
aroma
nicely
nice
dopplebock
flavor
it
has
that
sweet
maltiness
that
kind
of
eases
into
your
taste
buds
drinkability
is
the
draw
back
here
and
maybe
its
because
of
the
style
im
not
sure
better
than
most
but
not
as
good
as
say
celebrator
definitely
worth
a
try
the
flavor
carries
out
what
the
aroma
threatened
with
a
boldly
fruity
raisin
plum
character
right
up
front
some
toffee
and
light
creamy
chocolate
mixed
with
brandy
as
it
warms
and
a
drying
alcohol
finish
with
lingering
sweet
malty
notes
throughout
the
mouth
definitely
a
beer
to
be
savored
though
the
alcohol
is
a
little
distracting
its
also
somewhat
unique
and
fairly
enjoyable
worth
trying
pretty
drinkable
given
the
8
5
abv
great
tasting
version
of
the
style
i
was
left
surprised
and
impressed
by
this
guy
worth
a
try
imo
poured
in
an
imperial
pint
glass
forms
a
12
tan
head
which
laces
well
a
darkly
reddish
amber
brew
with
a
strong
malty
and
dark
fruits
aroma
with
a
smidgen
of
alcohol
taste
is
very
similar
to
what
the
nose
portends
which
is
a
good
thing
the
dark
fruits
and
alcohol
become
even
more
pronounced
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
excellent
for
the
style
and
drinkability
is
great
as
well
worth
the
search
to
experience
nice
to
have
a
dopple
that
doesnt
go
too
far
over
the
edge
overall
a
fairly
middleoftheroad
doppelbock
but
certainly
worth
a
try
my
one
problem
with
this
beer
is
that
its
a
bit
too
sweet
reaching
almost
the
point
of
being
cloying
after
only
a
couple
this
is
some
funky
stuff
and
not
in
a
good
way
overly
sweet
to
begin
the
mouth
then
fills
with
a
diacetyllabrusca
wine
flavor
which
is
highly
unpleasant
this
is
made
by
wagner
winery
in
lodi
ny
and
it
almost
tastes
like
grapes
instead
of
malts
were
used
in
the
brewing
process
im
traveling
to
the
finger
lakes
this
weekend
and
planning
on
making
a
trip
to
wagner
im
going
to
give
this
one
another
try
at
the
source
hopefully
the
bottle
i
had
was
skunked
it
pours
a
dark
mohagany
with
a
slight
haziness
and
a
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
malty
with
some
chocolate
and
caramel
in
the
nose
the
carbonation
is
a
little
low
for
my
taste
but
it
is
not
bad
the
body
is
smooth
and
very
malty
it
is
nutty
with
some
roasty
quality
as
well
as
some
cherry
and
prune
it
is
slightly
bitter
in
the
clean
finish
and
the
alcohol
lingers
a
little
a
nice
little
dopplebock
and
cheers
to
running4beer
and
bif
for
allowing
me
this
samplinjg
this
beer
is
a
winter
seasonal
done
up
in
the
style
of
great
german
beers
such
as
celebrator
and
optimator
the
colour
was
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
head
but
the
first
taste
was
pretty
bracing
i
noticed
a
predominate
sweetness
that
never
really
left
the
beer
the
malts
and
hops
were
out
front
but
a
lack
of
balance
and
finesse
made
this
beer
suffer
in
the
drinkability
area
kind
of
reminds
of
dicks
beer
from
washington
a
bit
unrefined
but
ambitious
in
attack
the
color
is
a
nice
dark
amber
the
alochol
content
is
pretty
high
but
their
is
no
harsh
alcohol
taste
it
is
sweet
but
not
to
sweet
there
is
a
little
chocolate
taste
but
not
to
much
it
is
has
a
medium
body
and
is
quite
drinkable
big
disappointment
here
not
recommended
taste
is
very
fruitychewy
without
being
overly
thick
or
sweet
it
strikes
a
nice
balance
between
the
malt
and
fruit
hops
are
nowhere
to
be
found
in
this
beer
not
too
shabby
good
brew
for
over
the
cold
months
could
definitely
see
eating
some
good
sharp
cheddar
with
this
good
doppelbock
that
smells
better
but
not
a
convincing
taster
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownamber
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
later
fades
and
laces
the
aroma
is
malty
with
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
nuts
the
taste
is
also
very
malty
there
is
that
warming
from
the
elevated
abv
there
is
a
very
dark
taste
this
is
not
a
weak
watery
ale
this
beer
has
some
character
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
although
i
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
this
is
a
heavy
bodied
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
a
good
drinking
beer
for
those
cold
nights
when
you
need
a
warmer
and
a
good
buzz
maybe
not
your
classic
doppelbock
in
body
but
the
flavor
more
than
makes
up
for
it
enjoyable
if
i
had
access
to
this
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
12to24
of
these
would
be
in
zaps
belly
every
winterspring
notes
i
have
had
better
double
bocks
but
this
one
did
me
just
fine
its
worth
a
try
that
is
for
sure

the
chocolates
played
nice
with
the
malt
flavours
as
well
overall
i
had
no
trouble
drinking
this
quickly
then
i
noted
the
8
5
mmmm
pour
me
another
this
beer
has
received
some
mixed
reviews
which
should
be
your
first
tipoff
that
something
beyond
the
ordinary
is
going
on
here
i
could
criticize
this
beer
for
lacking
some
of
the
spicy
zesty
hops
that
most
german
doppels
posess
also
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
instead
of
sticky
and
cloying
like
most
german
dopps
furthermore
the
flavor
is
roasty
and
alive
instead
of
being
the
sweet
caramelized
austere
woodvarnish
difficulttofinish
cloyfest
that
many
other
doppelbocks
are
maybe
im
being
harsh
on
the
style
in
general
but
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
forget
style
connotations
do
yourself
a
favor
and
enjoy
theres
a
maplesyrupbrownsugar
forest
vibe
oozing
from
the
brew
makes
sense
since
this
brew
comes
from
the
coniferous
northern
climes
of
this
fair
land
and
the
yeast
is
magnificent
alive
fruity
robust
healthful
anyway
i
should
just
say
simply
i
really
like
this
beer
any
extraneous
exuberance
or
verbiage
can
be
attributed
solely
to
the
8
5
as
i
said
not
my
style
but
nice
abv
at
8
5
scares
me
but
just
a
little
crisp
start
with
a
blast
of
cherry
fruitiness
it
quickly
dries
out
to
a
more
roasty
flavor
and
has
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
mix
the
aftertaste
is
like
toasted
pumpernickel
with
hints
of
rye
and
alcohol
a
dry
cherry
lifesaver
flavor
lingers
behind
on
the
palate
and
really
comes
in
at
the
end
a
very
interesting
brew
here
and
it
excites
me
to
have
some
more
from
wagner
valley
474
thanks
go
out
to
davo
for
my
first
sampling
of
wagner
brewing
pours
a
very
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
thin
head
nutty
almondlike
caramel
aroma
although
the
smell
is
very
good
its
not
nearly
as
intense
as
a
great
dopplebock
the
beer
has
medium
maltsweetness
creamy
full
mouthfeel
with
slight
carbonation
the
beer
is
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
not
an
outstanding
example
of
the
style
the
head
was
small
and
color
was
a
bit
like
dark
cider
and
cloudy
in
appearence
it
had
a
very
malty
nose
and
smell
of
dried
dark
fruits
the
taste
was
good
and
sweet
with
mainly
swet
caramel
and
white
chocolate
accents
the
mouthfeel
was
some
what
syrupy
with
little
carbonation
coming
off
tap
over
all
this
was
a
bit
too
sweet
and
syrupy
missing
some
of
the
true
doppelbock
charateristics
but
a
good
beer
none
the
less
if
you
like
sweet
i
do
murky
brown
color
with
a
plummy
aroma
malty
caramel
with
a
candy
sugar
character
fruity
and
quite
bright
overall
this
seemed
to
have
some
belgian
aspects
along
the
lines
of
a
dark
strong
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
clear
russett
brown
with
a
short
creamy
lighttan
head
that
holds
fairly
well
and
leaves
some
minor
lace
the
aroma
clearly
exhibits
some
alcohol
and
fruity
toasted
malts
vienna
the
body
is
mediumfull
with
a
mild
and
very
fine
carbonation
that
leaves
it
quite
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
nice
the
flavor
carries
out
what
the
aroma
threatened
with
a
boldly
fruity
raisin
plum
character
right
up
front
some
toffee
and
light
creamy
chocolate
mixed
with
brandy
as
it
warms
and
a
drying
alcohol
finish
with
lingering
sweet
malty
notes
throughout
the
mouth
definitely
a
beer
to
be
savored
though
the
alcohol
is
a
little
distracting
its
also
somewhat
unique
and
fairly
enjoyable
worth
trying
then
the
kids
needed
tending
to
and
in
the
subsequent
maelstrom
of
flying
toy
thomas
the
tank
engines
and
associated
track
the
beer
sat
and
warmed
up
a
bit
to
around
60
degrees
the
brew
really
blossomed
on
top
of
the
above
a
spicy
hop
flavor
made
its
way
out
of
the
glass
and
balanced
things
out
wonderfully
definitely
a
beer
to
sip
over
a
longer
period
or
to
serve
at
a
somewhat
warmer
temperature
as
that
seems
to
bring
out
the
most
in
it
the
best
of
ny
in
april
2002
at
tap
ny
every
attribute
is
solid
across
the
board
with
this
fine
brew
rich
chocolateyamber
color
great
balance
of
sweetness
roasted
malt
and
hops
had
it
fresh
on
tap
at
the
brewery
which
btw
is
a
cool
place
with
a
view
on
their
deck
overlooking
seneca
lake
that
rivals
even
that
of
andechs
i
recommend
a
visit
to
anyone
in
the
upstate
ny
area
outstanding
doppelbock

abv
little
carbonation
smooth
slight
hop
finish
i
prefer
darker
beers
and
sweeter
beers
so
perhaps
my
pallette
gives
this
brew
a
little
more
creedence
than
others
but
if
you
come
across
it
worth
a
try
for
sure
and
if
you
dont
like
it
comes
in
a
six
pack
send
me
the
other
five
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
extremely
drinkable
i
didnt
expect
the
abv
to
be
above
6
nice
malty
taste
nothing
overwhelming
medium
body
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
smells
slightly
alcoholy
very
drinkable
with
dark
chocolate
notes
o
nothing
super
special
to
write
home
about
but
not
bad
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
caramel
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
caramel
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
toasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
and
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
nothing
too
exciting
overall
the
best
way
to
describe
this
drink
is
like
a
mona
vie
it
is
not
a
drink
for
everyone
and
many
might
find
it
down
right
disgusting
at
first
but
after
a
few
you
will
find
yourself
craving
one
every
now
and
then
my
recommendation
is
to
try
some
other
drinks
first
but
if
you
elect
to
buy
a
case
make
sure
you
have
more
than
just
one
this
beer
takes
some
sophistication
possibly
more
than
i
currently
have
i
did
not
read
the
previous
review
beforehand
but
this
is
the
most
obvious
quality
of
this
beer
o
unimpressive
bock
that
has
tons
of
potential
firstly
youd
never
guess
that
lobotomy
is
10
8
it
tastes
like
a
45
brewalthough
i
guess
this
is
a
plus
for
some
mouthfeel
and
taste
are
forgetful
lobotomy
is
too
filtered
and
restrained
for
its
own
good
if
i
had
to
describe
this
brew
in
one
word
it
would
be
withdrawn
it
has
a
lot
less
personality
than
i
was
expecting
and
i
predict
it
will
speak
to
very
few
individuals
wouldnt
buy
again
its
almost
hard
for
me
to
believe
this
is
a
10
5
abv
beer
at
first
the
pour
into
the
glass
seems
to
nice
that
is
until
you
realize
there
isnt
much
head
or
body
to
it
though
its
a
dark
beer
it
doesnt
have
that
deep
of
a
taste
to
it
pretty
bland
characteristics
i
tried
the
indian
wells

i
cant

to

more
highly

o
good
doppelbock
although
there
isnt
really
anything
in
this
beer
that
wows
me
tastes
kind
of
like
raisin
bran
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
awesome
bottle
art
too
o
nice
doppelbock
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
if
that
even
is
possible
when
it
comes
to
doppelbocks
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
this
is
a
very
good
representation
of
what
a
doppel
bock
is
supposed
to
be
its
not
outstanding
and
wont
blow
you
away
but
if
youre
a
fan
of
this
style
that
not
a
lot
of
american
breweries
do
right
then
this
beer
will
suffice
nicely
would
enjoy
this
again
but
its
a
bit
too
fullon
for
me
to
make
this
a
session
beer
people
who
favour
the

might
find
it

just
enough

after

i
could
get

pretty

i

wont
be
seeking
this
out
again
d
a
very
smooth

doppelbock
not
that
familiar
with
the
style
but
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
would
not
mind
having
this
on
a
regular
basis
o
incredibly
well
balanced
and
complex
db
nice
flavor
profile
but
too
sweet
and
clingy
altogether
not
fruit
to
speak
of
which
is
either
wrong
or
just
shows
the
range
in
the
style
this
is
supposed
to
be
hirschs
best
which
is
damning
with
faint
praise
there
are
better
double
bocks
o
enjoyed
it
a

nice
doppel
d
personally
id
only
drink
one
in
a

due
to
the
rich
taste
heaviness
and
abv
but
thats
entirely
keeping
with
the
style
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
light
bodied

its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors

id
like
to
taste
this
with
some
more
bitterness
but
i
guess
this
is
very
true
to
style
ill
have
to
keep
my
eye
out
for
some
american
doppelbocks
read

an

wine
overkill
i
might
enjoy
this
if
i
was
standing
in
an
igloo
in
nunavut
o
seems
like
it
would
be
a
decent
beer
for
the
style
i
have
nothing
to
compare
to
though
a
lot
sweeter
than
i
would
like
my
beer
to
be
this
is
a
real
doppelbock
that
is
rich
in
flavor
the
mouth
feel
is
thick
and
malty
the
smell
is
that
of
over
ripe
fruit
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
yet
it
finishes
like
a
lager
without
the
hops
i
love
all
bock
beers
especially
doppelbock
so
i
can
say
with
out
a
doubt
this
beer
is
going
into
my
top
10
conclusion
this
is
a
high
quality
authentic
german
doppelbock
rich
complex
and
satisfying
you
can
virtually
taste
the
history
behind
this
beer
as
you
drink
it
i
would
definitely
buy
it
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
it
would
be
particularly
nice
to
drink
as
a
fall
seasonal
overall
a
very
interesting
doppelbock
on
all
perspectives
sweet
smelling
and
tasting
with
lots
of
bready
malts
and
dark
fruity
flavours
with
a
hint
of
spices
in
the
finish
all
in
all
a
good
doppelbock
and
one
of
the
better
ones
that
i
have
tasted
good
price
point
at
the
lcbo
too
bad
its
a
seasonal
release
there
o
i
was
not
familiar
with
this
beer
and
took
a
chance
pleasant
surprise
and
something
i
will
go
back
to
i
am
now
officially
a
doppelbock
fan
taste
cant
match
easy
drinking
and
simple
bready
malts
dark
fruits
sweet
and
silky
brown
sugar
cola
slightly
musty
little
too
sweet
doesnt
have
the
dryness
in
the
finish
to
balance
out
just
sweet
and
dies
into
thin
nothing
not
the
layers
of
depth
you
want
from
a
good
dopplebock
hides
the
abv
well
silky
mouthfeel
o
not
my
favorite
doppelbock
but
it
was
worth
the
4
if
anything
for
the
swingtop
bottle
to
be
reused
assertive
on
the
malts
no
hop
aroma
or
flavor
to
speak
of
dquite
drinkable
despite
the
high
abv
and
sweetness
not
the
most
accessible
bock
but
feels
like
a
serious
beer
for
serious
beer
drinkers
d
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
poured
into
a
12
liter
stein
a
rich
mahogany
color
with
a
rather
thin
off
white
headthe
clarity
and
richness
was
niceit
overshadowed
the
lack
of
a
head
lighter
aromas
of
caramel
maltplumlike
fruitinessand
light
ironnot
a
real
assertive
nose
one
of
the
sweeter
german
made
doppelbocks
its
heavy
on
the
caramel
and
plumprune
sweetnessin
saying
that
its
warming
and
is
what
its
supposed
to
be
lighter
in
feel
but
it
goes
down
easily
without
much
alcohol
presence
this
would
be
good
on
a
cold
winters
day
wich
we
dont
get
here
in
nc
very
much
this
is
a
versatile
beer
with
a
robustness
that
would
pair
well
with
a
number
of
foods
but
it
is
not
overpowering
like
some
dopples
smooth
and
rich
it
goes
down
quite
easily
its
alcohol
over
7
could
sneak
up
on
you
though
a
really
nice
dopplebock
fruitier
than
most
doppelbocks
yet
still
authentic
to
the
style
i
could
use
a
touch
more
malt
to
offset
the
fruit
but
very
good
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
a
dark
brown
with
hints
of
rusty
orange
tan
head
with
some
lace
and
retention
dark
fruits
and
raisin
in
the
nose
prominent
and
clearly
malt
forward
taste
has
this
with
a
greater
notion
of
the
malts
here
toffee
and
caramel
can
sense
the
heat
in
the
finish
but
is
more
warming
than
harsh
medium
low
carbonation
and
a
solid
drink
especially
in
the
colder
months
d
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
the
problem
i
run
in
to
with
doppelbocks
is
cloying
sweetness
this
one
does
a
great
job
at
balancing
the
flavors
making
for
a
drinkable
brew
with
fairly
well
hidden
abv
drink
the
beer
tasted
a
lot
like
a
scotch
ale
which
isnt
one
of
my
favourite
styles
still
drinkable
though
and
im
happy
i
gave
it
a
shot
so
the
appearance
on
this
beer
was
a
bit
disappointing
i
like
foam
this
beer
had
little
to
none
and
dissipated
quickly
whats
left
is
a
dark
copper
colour
beer
that
almost
seems
flat
very
little
carbonation
odd
still
nice
bit
of
lace
well
appearances
are
deceiving
this
is
another
delicious
brew
nice
aroma
of
dark
fruits
raisins
nuts
earthy
malts
bit
of
spice
and
some
caramel
good
strong
flavours
without
it
being
overpowering
or
bold
lots
of
caramel
throughout
with
the
fruits
and
malts
rounding
out
very
little
bitterness
what
is
their
seems
to
be
from
roasted
malts
very
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
quite
soothing
actually
deceptively
drinkable
one
could
view
this
as
a
session
beer
until
the
7
2abv
kicks
in
asides
from
a
poor
appearance
a
wonderful
beer
d
i
could
definately
drink
alot
of
these
in
a
night
i
really
wanted
another
once
i
was
done
and
nothing
about
this
got
boring
d
i
wouldve
liked
this
to
be
a
bit
drier
but
on
occasion
i
do
enjoy
big
sweet
malt
bombs
with
flavours
reminiscent
of
mackintosh
toffee
so
all
is
not
lost
and
also
on
the
plus
side
i
can
add
another
swingtop
to
the
homebrewing
rotation
another
delicious
doppelbock
with
a
bit
of
tweaking
here
and
there
to
create
a
better
head
and
coax
out
more
interesting
aromas
this
would
be
a
solid
a
or
a
overall
quite
sweet
smooth
mouthfeel
very
good
drinkability
another
solid
german
brew
overall
a
bit
mild
for
a
doppel
but
reasonably
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
malt
flavors
like
chewing
on
fresh
grain
but
without
the
hulls
getting
stuck
in
your
teeth
the
nougat
melenoidins
were
a
nice
support
and
werent
to
strong
making
this
beer
full
but
very
drinkable
there
is
very
little
hops
to
speak
of
but
it
does
finish
clean
and
robust
there
is
even
a
slight
spice
hidden
at
the
end
to
help
clean
this
beer
off
your
palate
i
wouldnt
serve
this
beer
too
cold
or
you
will
numb
all
of
the
malts
try
it
between
8
to
12
celcius
4554f
on
its
own
or
with
grilled
red
meats
dishes
featuring
caramelized
onions
mushrooms
or
rich
herbs
d
if
you
like
this
style
i
think
this
is
def
one
to
try
despite
the
heavy
flavours
this
beer
still
manages
to
show
its
lager
side
being
easily
quaffable
this
is
definitely
a
nourishing
brew
that
would
see
one
through
lent
and
beyond
rich
malt
spine
big
chew
on
munich
malts
in
the
front
and
a
detectable
wonderful
mellowness
in
the
character
of
this
beer
that
allows
all
the
intense
flavors
to
meld
together
but
very
subtly
the
only
sharp
edge
is
from
a
nearly
cloying
sweetness
that
seems
to
have
a
molasses
signature
to
it
that
suggests
adjuncts
if
it
wasnt
for
the
low
carbonation
i
could
enjoy
a
bunch
of
these
as
it
is
its
still
pretty
good
stuff
d
drinkability
was
fair
per
style
malty
with
a
good
presence
of
hops
on
the
close
that
suits
this
well
worthy
of
a
single
purchase
despite
some
warming
alcohol
that
is
usual
for
the
style
this
is
easy
to
drink
its
caramelly
yet
earthy
not
the
richest
or
fullest
of
doppelbocks
but
certainly
a
solid
choice
for
one
that
is
sweetish
but
not
too
sweet
has
warmth
but
yet
easytodrink
d
this
is
delicious
goes
down
easy
and
was
a
great
decision
for
my
first
beer
of
this
style
cheers
i
like
it
a
lot
more
than
i
remember
liking
it
last
year
ive
gone
through
a
few
of
these
halflitre
bottles
since
it
started
showing
up
on
lcbo
shelves
this
spring
and
will
probably
go
through
a
few
more
before
its
gone
drinkability
is
good
pretty
well
balanced
good
malt
profile
with
a
fairly
nice
depth
a
solid
doppelbock
d
while
this
is
obviously
a
sweet
malty
beer
given
the
style
im
impressed
by
the
fruity
and
spicy
character
this
doppelbock
has
a
surprisingly
fruity
perky
nose
in
particular
scores
this
one
some
points
d
wonderful
beer
big
malty
character
that
suits
the
style
great
representation
of
a
doppelbock
flavor
lots
of
melanoïd
malty
goodness
a
firm
but
nondescript
other
than
maybe
a
little
spicyearthy
hop
bitterness
to
balance
the
malt
a
fair
bit
of
alcohol
warming
that
only
makes
the
beer
even
better
a
great
doppelbock
definitely
one
to
keep
in
mind
for
cold
winterspring
evenings
might
have
to
pick
up
a
bottle
or
two
for
the
cellar
this
marks
my
first
dopplebock
and
it
was
great
full
flavoured
well
balanced
and
a
joy
to
drink
the
only
downside
stemmed
from
its
weak
head
but
thats
a
minor
complaint
id
be
glad
to
buy
this
again
as
well
as
any
other
dopplebock
for
that
matter
if
you
see
it
make
sure
to
pick
one
up
it
smells
fairly
sweet
almost
nutty
with
caramel
im
worried
it
will
taste
too
sweet
after
the
smell
but
it
has
a
great
almost
roasted
malt
taste
without
the
sweetness
overpowering
a
little
bit
too
boozy
but
it
is
incredibly
smooth
nice
level
of
bitterness
i
wish
we
could
get
this
all
year
round
in
ontario
crystal
brown
body
with
tan

3finger

some
nice

to
modest

rather
dry

easy
to
drink
easy
to
haze
outstanding
doppelbock
this
thing
looks
great
on
the
runway
and
it
does
not
matter
what
she
is
wearing
a
dark
amber
crystal
so
sexy
like
chewing
malted
barley
and
letting
it
soak
in
your
mouth
for
a
couple
minutes
stays
sweet
a
soft
spiciness
in
the
hops
alcohol
peering
through
the
bines
a
bit
clingy
wish
it
finished
a
little
drier
not
memorable
just
tasty
i
found
the
body
and
drinkability
to
both
be
fairly
typical
for
the
style
i
picked
this
up
at
the
local
food
coop
and
wasnt
either
thrilled
or
disappointed
in
this
brew
ill
probably
try
it
agin
its
worth
at
least
a
shot
for
you
as
well
overall
excellent
drinkability
not
overtly
easy
to
drink
but
it
does
go
down
smooth
not
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
but
if
i
was
in
a
doppelbock
mood
id
reach
for
it
my
favorite
dopple
bock
it
is
very
nutty
with
malt
overtones
a
malt
lovers
dream
but
not
overly
sweet
dryer
than
most
in
this
style
but
balanced
nice
color
and
presentation
its
actually
better
in
germany
on
tap
doesnt
taste
as
fresh
in
the
us
but
still
wonderful
beer
drinkability
musch
smoother
than
its
7
2
alcohol
pretty
smooth
but
i
think
its
just
too
lightly
carbonated
silky
mouthfeel
with
a
very
pleasant
caramel
malt
profile
and
hints
of
milk
chocolate
toffee
hazelnut
dark
fruit
and
a
subtle
dry
hop
finish
also
there
is
a
good
bit
of
bready
yeast
giving
this
beer
a
nice
feel
without
it
being
watered
down
slightly
spicy
with
hints
of
clove
and
sweet
alcohol
the
sweetness
overtakes
the
silky
malt
feel
a
bit
but
still
pretty
good
d
i
dig
the
cool
flip
top
bottle
on
this
one
the
beer
is
also
outstanding
i
love
dopplebocks
and
this
one
for
sure
did
not
dissapoint
drinkability
is
good
but
one
bottle
is
plenty

me

makes
this
an

dopplebock
i
liked
it
had
several
doppelbocks
this
evening
and
this
one
was
a
clear
winner
drinkable
distinctive
but
not
something
that
you
would
be
able
to
put
away
a
ton
of
i
almost
always
like
these
authentic
bavarian
dopplers
and
this
one
is
decent
if
not
outstanding
huge
mmalt
pprofile
up

is
loaded
with
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
flavors
and
an
underlying
current
of
dark
fruit
slight
burned
note
as
well
but
the
alcohol
is
kept
under
wraps
partially
due
to
the
molasses
level
of
thickness
in
texture
for
a
lager
especially
this
is
one
hearty
brew
its
not
quite
up
there
with
celabrator
but
this
is
good
honest
bavarian
dark
beer
and
worth
trying
d
quite
easy
to
drink
though
it
is
7
2
abv
the
drink
is
fullish
in
body
creamy
and
slick
in
the
mouth
a
sizzle
of
fine
carbonation
lightens
the
body
to
a
level
of
good
quaffability
drinkability
hides
its
abv
well
not
something
that
id
session
but
two
or
possibly
three
would
be
enjoyable
drinkability
an
above
average
brew
i
was
initially
deterred
by
the
uninspired
smell
but
on
the
whole
this
is
a
drinkable
doppelbock
quaffable
if
you
like
sweet
malty
and
dry
beers
a
very
decent
beer
and
one
of
the
superior
choices
of
the
lcbo
our
local
government
largest
buyer
of
alcohol
in
the
world
pours
darkish
carbonation
is
high
and
mouthfeel
not
as
smooth
as
could
beand
on
the
sweetish
side
but
decent
drinker
average
for
its
style
a
decent
doppelbock
on
the
sweeter
end
of
the
spectrum
but
still
enjoyable
to
drink
light
oak
pour
iwth
a
smooth
offwhite
head
but
the
retention
and
lacing
is
not
that
great
awesome
aroma
though
full
of
chocolate
raisins
and
all
manner
of
malty
goodness
sweet
juicy
flavour
raisins
chocolate
and
light
caramel
with
some
solid
enough
bready
malts
in
the
background
medium
body
and
carbonation
its
okay
but
its
a
bit
simplistic
compared
to
other
doppels
d
quite
drinkable
not
too
much
carbonation
sort
of
syrupy
i
was
not
to
crazy
about
this
beer
clear
dark
brown
with
a
solid
head
of
quick
dropping
foam
nose
is
malty
and

with
pungent
dark

very
sweet
with
hints
of

and
an
earthiness
light
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
and
quite
crisp
finish
very
drinkable
well
balanced
doppelbock
full
flavoured
but
by
no
means
overthetop
in
any
category
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
i
could
easily
have
another
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
just
wish
it
had
a
little
more
carbonation
poured
half
into
a
pokhal
glass
blue
and
the
other
half
into
a
clear
guinness
glass
chestnut
brown
but
darker
still
able
to
see
fingers
on
other
side
of
glass
a
1
to
2
finger
mocha
head
nose
of
brandy
and
dark
fruit
taste
of
dark
fruit
prune
very
forward
but
with
a
syrupy
texture
and
mouthfeel
only
a
little
bitter
in
the
middle
and
hardly
any
malt
as
far
as
i
can
tell
alcohol
quite
noticeable
heavy
dense
body
sweetness
of
the
darker
fruit
increases
with
air
im
not
a
fan
of
this
style
and
this
offering
doesnt
convert
me
still
this
ia
acceptable
although
not
particularly
great
example
of
the
dopplebock
style
the
mouthfeel
is
great
incredibly
smooth
and
creamy
for
a
lager
moreover
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
the
strength
is
incredibly
wellhidden
a
good
dopplebock
should
remind
you
to
lift
with
your
legs
i
doubt
anybody
will
be
throwing
out
their
back
out
with
this
one
getting
a
headache
maybe
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
then
again
i
love
the
style
so
ill
admit
my
expectations
were
high
all
scrutiny
aside
i
wouldnt
be
reluctant
to
drink
this
again
but
i
might
be
to
pay
for
it
myself
good
mouthfeel
thin
to
medium
bodied
with
a
medium
carbonation
not
extremely
drinkable
and
i
wouldnt
buy

its

alongside

wouldnt
call
this
chuggable
per
se
but
you
can
throw
it
back
at
a
steady
pace
which
of
course
is
always
a
good
thing
i
always
purchase
as
many
of
these
as
i
can
when
i
go
to
ft
bragg
as
the
class
vi
store
usually
has
a
great
price
adequate
supply
and
fast
turnover
thanks
to
the
thirsty
paratroopers
and
retired
paratroopers
that
shop
there
i
really
dig
this
doppelbock
as
its
not
cookie
cutter
at
all
clearly
not
modeled
after
other
examples
this
one
is
paving
its
own
path
and
doing
a
great
job
of
it
beautiful
on
the
whole
a
bit
sweet
on
its
own
this
one
works
beautifully
well
with
some
food
its
strong
enough
to
be
a
solid
sipper
and
it
opens
up
beautifully
as
it
warms
but
the
flavor
profile
and
mouthfeel
make
it
easily
downable
as
well
a
solid
dopplebock
with
a
good
bit
of
character
overall
this
is
a
high
quality
bier
that
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
the
hirsch
brau
brands
are
all
very
good
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
recommend
it
strongly
prosit
mfd
decent
overall
but
a
little
in
the
thin
side
paired
well
with
knockwurst
kruat
taste
is
dry
yet
crisp
malt
corn
and
a
touch
of
sweet
caramel
leaves
the
mouth
on
the
dry
side
very
clean
and
malty
with
lots
of
earthy
notes
malt
rules
this
beer
and
there
is
really
no
detectable
hops
some
evident
dark
cherry
in
the
finish
no
alcohol
noticeable
at
any
time
this
goes
down
as
smooth
as
a
trad
bock
and
it
is
right
on
the
border
of
the
two
styles
at
7
2
d
very
drinkable
and
a
superb
match
to
all
sorts
of
foods
e
g
burgers
ribs
and
probably
any
germaninspired
fare
m
d
i
wouldnt
mind
a
touch
creamier
but
not
bad
all
around
its
got
a
bit
of
a
creaminess
to
it
especially
as
it
warms
and
a
nice
tingling
carbonation
it
goes
down
very
clean
and
easily
so
i
have
to
remind
myself
that
its
got
a
bit
of
alcohol
going
on
to
me
the
mouthfeel
ups
this
beers
stockcreamy
smooth
durable
never
flat
but
not
too
effervescentreally
well
done
it
was
hard
to
set
the
mug
down
and
i
wish
i
had
grabbed
a
second
one
of
this
instead
of
the
helles
which
was
a
bit
disappointing
not
so
with
the
dopplebock
though
i
remain
partial
to
others
such
as
salvator
and
korbinian
this
is
very
good
this
one
poured
a
dark
brown
almost
the
appearance
of
a
pop
smelled
slightly
of
scotch
and
dark
roasted
malts
very
malty
on
the
pallate
and
a
coffee
taste
with
a
slight
hop
presence
after
i
let
it
sit
a
little
bit
to
warm
the
alchohol
came
through
and
it
developed
a
caramel
flavor
mouthfeel
was
on
the
medium
side
it
was
pretty
drinkable
to
me
but
it
was
a
little
higher
in
abv
for
more
than
about
23
poured
a
dark
leather
brownblackish
hue
couldve
been
the
dim
lighting
with
a
smallish
had
and
little
lacings
there
were
some
hops
springing
to
my
nose
and
a
faint
smell
of
malt
but
not
really
a
good
smell
here
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
was
phenomonal
one
of
the
smoothest
and
creamiest
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
but
still
manages
to
pack
a
malt
wallop
with
bread
coffeecocoa
caramel
and
im
sure
other
things
like
brown
sugar
that
im
missing
but
i
hope
the
point
comes
across
balanced
well
it
has
a
slightly
dry
aftertaste
while
also
maintaing
its
sweetness
if
it
wasnt
so
filling
after
a
bottle
and
also
a
little
up
there
in
abv
id
session
this
nonetheless
if
you
havent
tried
this
do
so
asap
drinkability
becomes
cloying
after
a
while
many
other
better
doppelbocks
out
there
the
taste
was
malt
all
the
way
with
chocolate
and
spice
it
was
a
full
bodied
brew
with
a
slight
hop
ness
that
countered
the
malt
all
day
flavor
the
7
2
percent
was
somewhat
apparent
but
it
had
the
spiciness
tied
to
it
i
quite
enjoyed
the
effort
and
care
put
in
the
brew
pours
a
dark
mahogany
brown
with
amber
highlights
and
magnificent
clarity
a
very
dense
and
creamy
one
and
half

head
of
pale

foam
shows
passing
retention
and
spotty
lacing
deeply
roasted
crystal
malts
and
fragrant
honey
aromas
dominate
with
a
rich
vinous
scent
and
spicy
german
hops
in
the
background
dark
caramel
and
rasinberry
phenols
strike
the
tounge
first
then
robust
and
bready
dextrins
deepen
the
malt
profile
the
dark
honey
and
wine
character
appear

are

and

the
malt
sweetness
light
but
balancing
noble
hops
in
the
aftertaste
soft
and
floral
like
hallertau
with
a
very
mellow
bitteness
a
suggestion
of
alcohol
further
puts
the
formidable
malt
flavor
in
check
while
adding
a
degree
of
complexity
and
becomes
more
apparent
as
it
warms
the
body
is
full
and
the
carbonation
is
light
allowing
a
residual
sweetness
to
coat
the
toungeonly
offset
by
mild
hops
and
a
hint
of
booze
the
beer
finishes
rich
with
malt
flavor
and
gentle
steely
caramel
but
not
syrupy
or
cloying
it
remains
highly
quaffable
to
the
last
sip
due
to
its
uncanny
smoothness

outstanding
example
of
the

i
fear
the

i
had
may
not
have
fared
well
in
the

overseas
but
even
saying
that
its
a
dopplebock
pure
and
simple
and
a
strong
enough
to
stand
on
its
own
now
i
will
say
that
this
is
a
step
up
from
the
neuschwansteiner
as
soon
as
a
poured
this
out
of
its
bottle
i
was
excited
the
smell
of
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
was
a
great
greeting
and
the
dark
amber
color
head
the
dark
brown
color
of
the
beer
is
a
warm
inviting
color
on
a
cold
day
the
first
sip
was
very
smooth
and
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
taste
also
over
all
i
must
say
this
beer
was
a
great
choice
poured
from
a
5
liter
fliptop
the
pour
yelds
a
very
creamy

not
as
dark
as
other

i
have
had

is
fantastic
maltycaramels

is

matching

profile
this
is
not
the
heaviest
dopplebock
by
far
but
very
creamy
mouthfeel
to
savor
the
drinkablity
is
fantastic
i
have
to
make
myself
put
it
down
great
nightcap

brew
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
hard
to
not
gulp
it
down
i
have
to
admit
that
i
am
still
a
little
tipsy
from
this
brew
because
i
couldnt
help
drinking
it
so
fast
i
hope
i
can
find
another
one
of
these
or
several
and
i
highly
recommend
it
especially
if
you
arent
real
familiar
to
the
style
drinkability
surprisingly
yummy
after
mediocre
first
impressions
this
is
sweet
yet
interesting
enough
to
make
it
enjoyable
to
quaff
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
with
a
tan
head
nose
is
subdued
basically
just
smells
like
sugar
water
flavor
has
a
decent
profile
that
starts
off
sweet
and
ends
a
bit
spiced
overall
you
get
a
thick
sugary
aftertaste
in
the
mouth
feel
is
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
nice
bubble
to
it
and
thick
with
ingredients
it
is
drinkable
a
nice
effort
of
the
style
worth
trying
and
seems
very
well
made
i
must
say
i
had
this
in
my
fridge
for
a
while
and
while
it
is
a
good
beer
its
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
will
make
you
crave
it
this
one
is
pretty
complex
and
delicious
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
this
one
too
fast
without
enjoying
it
recommended
this
was
another
of
my
finds
on
the
half
price
shelf
they
hadnt
been
bought
after
sitting
in
the
store
for
11
months
so
they
were
marked
down
from
2
99bottle
to
1
50
they
had
about
twenty
of
them
so
after
drinking
a
couple
today
i
think
ill
go
back
and
buy
whatever
they
have
left
nicely
preaged
for
me
edit
i
find
as
i
finish
the
beeraka
it
warms
up
some
a
touch
of
bitterness
comes
through
to
really
balance
out
the
flavour
i
think
for
this
style
of
beer
this
is
a
great
offering
it
is
a
very
filling
beer
that
is
almost
a
meal
unto
itself
very
enjoyable
d
great
introduction
to
doppelbocks
until
other
examples
are
available

was

i
will
not

again
i
think
d
just
about
perfect
its
complex
interesting
sweet
and
scrumptious
but
also
understated
and
mild
in
a
way
this
is
less
balls
out
malty
than
some
other
doppelbocks
and
imo
that
adds
to
its
drinkability
cool
bottle
this
doppelhirsch
comes
in
i
like
it
pours
a
deep
rich
brown
color
with
some
hints
of
rubyorange
at
the
base
where
the
light
shines
in
thin
foamy
head
on
top
which
fades
quickly
big
foamy
bubbles
collect
along
the
sides
as
the
head
dissipates
sweet
malty
fruit
aroma
dates
and
raisins
maybe
some
vanilla
some
plum
hidden
deep
in
there
as
well
tastes
sweet
and
malty
as
well
with
some
of
the
same
raisinydate
flavors
finishes
tart
with
a
smokey
aftertaste
i
dont
think
ive
ever
quite
had
a
beer
finish
like
this
before
its
interesting
if
nothing
else
weird
aftertaste
for
sure
a
little
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
but
tends
to
become
a
bit
chewier
as
it
sits
and
warms
up
this
is
not
unusual
for
most
doppels
that
ive
had
the
alcohol
is
slightly
noticeable
here
but
does
not
detract
from
the
overall
odd
characteristics
of
this
beer
its
probably
not
one
that
ill
come
back
to
but
its
worth
checking
out
if
youre
a
fan
of
doppelbocks
i
am
and
this
one
is
unlike
any
others
ive
had
my
bottle
poured
with
almost
no
head
and
carbonation
very
low
aroma
is
not
great
mostly
of
dark
fruit
malty
sweet
flavor
but
not
bad
it
is
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
one
though
the
fruit
flavor
is
prominent
raisons
and
prunes
mouthfeel
is
about
right
for
the
style
this
beer
is
just
ok
poured
from
a
beautiful
0
5ml
bottle
with
a
grolschstyle
cap
the
beer
was
clear
and
bronzecolored
with
a
weak
looking
head
didnt
last
1
minute
the
smell
was
sweet
and
malty
not
as
aggressive
as
typical
ator
style
beers
but
not
bad
the
flavor
was
malty
and
sweet
also
mediumthick
mouthfeel
and
easy
to
drink
good
but
not
worth
seeking
for
too
hard
edit
just
noticed
this
one
puts
beer
in
my
mug
thanks
to
ba
for
a
great
site
taste
was
malty
and
husky
with
burned
roasted
notes
which
strongly
remind
me
of
chocolate
body
is
very
full
and
the
beer
is
sticky
and
sweet
there
is
a
bitter
comig
from
both
hop
and
maltbitterness
drinkabilty
was
still
very
good
despite
the
beer
being
sweet
and
fiull
i
really
liked
this
beer
a
perfect
compliment
to
hearty
game
dishes
to
warm
fruit
or
chocolate
and
carmel
desserts
if
only
i
had
some
creme
burle
and
fudge
sauce
probably
a
great
beer
when
carbonated
this
one
wasnt
im
now
inspecting
the
cap
the
rubber
seal
is
still
flexible
and
not
cracked
but
the
porcelain
cap
was
been
chipped
theres
the
culprit
i
will
have
to
buy
another
or
try
to
exchange
this
one
because
this
beer
has
potential
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
unfortunately
becomes
a
bit
hard
to
finish
with
the
almost
cloying
sweetness
i
could
maybe
the
handle
this
beer
a
little
more
if
the
mouthfeel
were
a
bit
more
robust
and
the
coffee
and
roasted
malt
flavors
were
a
little
stronger
very
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
i
will
likely
start
keeping
this
one
on
hand
pretty
nice
would
have
another
notes
one
of
the
qualities
i
love
about
dopples
is
the
attractiveness
of
the
offering
and
the
depth
of
the
malt
character
although
this
hits
ok
on
the
malt
profile
its
really
nothing
to
look
at
and
is
ho
hum
in
the
overall
product
worth
your
time
for
sure
as
it
has
an
unusual
bend
to
it
md
quite
refreshing
for
a
7
2abv
double
bock
much
lighter
in
texture
and
body
than
other
samples
ive
tried
overall
it
suffers
a
bit
from
a
lack
of
focus
and
a
richer
flavour
profile
but
this
is
a
very
quaffable
double
bock
to
me
very
easydrinking
despite
its
alc
strength
very
tasty
dopplebock
one
that
stands
out
well
among
the
excellent
versions
available
in
the
us
drinkability
is
ok
but
i
was
glad
that
is
was
over
if
you
were
forced
to
drink
makro
swill
all
day
when
you
come
home
you
would
be
glad
this
was
in
your
fridge
but
were
not
so
be
glad
there
are
better
choices
out
there
i
am
saddened
that
this
had
to
make
such
a
long
trip
not
to
be
loved
to
much
energy
was
spent
they
could
have
sent
better
basicaly
they
did
not
care
they
should
have
end
rant
mk
drinkability
overall
a
nice
above
average
german
doppelbock
that
i
might
consider
buying
again
if
they
put
more
into
the
beer
like
they
did
with
the
label
then
this
would
be
a
kickass
doppelbock
that
would
rival
celebrator
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
virtually
no
head
and
only
the
slightest
bit
of
carbonation
making
the
beer
appear
flat
aromas
of
plums
raisins
roasted
malt
syrup
and
bark
were
detectable
the
taste
was
full
of
malt
and
fruit
flavors
quite
sweet
with
a
smoothness
normal
for
this
style
somewhat
breadlike
in
texture
with
a
rich
and
creamy
finish
quite
tastey
and
enjoyable
but
definitely
needs
more
carbonation
unless
i
just
got
a
flat
bottle
a
very
easy
sipper
delicious
by
itself
or
as
an
afterdinner
dessert
the
body
has
a
medium
thickness
to
it
with
a
carbonation
level
that
is
a
bit
too
intense
for
the
style
yet
is
still
quite
enjoyable
the
beer
has
a
semidry
finish
that
enhances
its
drinkable
qualities
a
solid
doppelbock
allaround
true
to
the
style
and
avoiding
any
glaring
errors
in
its
presentation
a
nice
enough
beer
not
overwhelming
in
any
one
way
and
fairly
complex
cheap
too
this
beer
poured
a
clear
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
tiny
head
that
didnt
stick
around
unfortunately
i
think
that
the
swingtop
bottle
this
beer
comes
in
doesnt
do
a
good
job
of
providing
an
airtight
seal
the
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
and
malty
with
whiffs
of
caramel
in
the
nose
taste
was
also
malty
but
it
was
also
quite
fruity
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
bite
in
the
finish
overall
this
beer
was
rather
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
and
seemed
like
it
was
lacking
something
this
is
one
of
the
more
disappointing
doppelbocks
that
ive
had
very
drinkable
the
7
2
abv
doesnt
factor
too
much
this
actually
tasted
fresher
than
most
samples
most
werent
refrigerated
i
drank
in
ge
go
figure
maybe
alittle
to
light
for
the
style
but
not
by
much
give
this
a
shot
hinge
top
bottle
pours
light
brown
color
with
fairly
weak
head
aroma
is
also
pretty
light
with
some
sweet
maltyness
medium
body
mouthfeel
could
use
more
carbonation
to
hide
some
of
the
slick
sweet
maltyness
taste
is
a
bit
of
toasted
grainy
malt
but
somwhat
on
the
sweet
and
fruity
side
not
a
bad
doublebock
but
a
bit
too
syrupy
sweet
for
my
taste
aroma
is
molasses
sweet
pastry
and
dark
fruits
redbrown
body
holds
a
mostly
diminishing
pinky
thick
tan
head
fairly
still
and
malt
sweet
fore
needs
just
a
touch
of
carbonation
because
flavor
wise
it
is
decent
enough
but
it
feels
wrong
that
still
finish
is
pretty
bready
and
honey
tinged
the
taste
also
keeps
with
the
smell
with
a
stronger
malt
and
no
to
limited
hop
flavor
a
bite
that
can
be
felt
but
not
really
tasted
there
is
a
slight
off
flavor
at
the
end
of
the
beer
which
probably
has
to
do
with
the
yeast
more
than
anything
in
my
opinion
doppelbocks
should
be
smooth
and
no
off
or
dominate
flavors
should
be
present
this
beer
has
a
off
flavor
that
is
noticeable
and
brings
the
beer
off
but
dont
get
me
wrong
for
this
big
of
a
beer
and
the
great
malt
and
limited
hop
flavor
it
still
is
an
enjoyable
drink

i
dont

i
could

of
it
overall
a
very
good
beer
not
something
that
i
would
want
to
drink
multiples
of

something
that
would
complement

very
nicely

from

to
a

the
smoothest

ive
had
by

but
its
not

either
the

matches
the

for
the
most

i
would
possibly
consider
trying
it

the

however
are
something
less
than
impressive
a
reread
tells
me
that
this
review
is
somewhat
clinical
in
nature
but
then
thats
to
be
expected
when
the

is
as
sterile

as

this

is

overly
fond

doppelhirsch
does
nothing
to
change
my
mind
about
the
brewery
as
a
whole
this
beer
had
no
head
at
all
and
very
little
carbonation
other
than
that
it
was
a
malty
tasty
brew
dont
let
the
looks
deceive
you
this
beer
isnt
a
looker
but
it
delivers
the
goods
where
it
counts
pours
a
rich
ruby
brown
with
minimal
head
and
a
thin
wisp
of
lace
smells
of
a
rich
caramel
toffee
raisin
plum
and
a
bit
af
alcohol
in
the
nose
tatses
of
a
rich
caramel
also
has
some
raisin
and
plum
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
a
nice
hop
bitterness
that
doesnt
linger
much
minimal
carbonation
a
bit
thick
and
syrupy
but
still
crisp
and
refreshing
nicely
lagered
very
easy
drinking
for
a
doppel

nice
buy

the
beer
is
a
dark
leathery
brown
tinged
with
ruby
when
held
to
light
good
clarity
no
head
at
all
the
aroma
is
pleasant
enough
rich
caramelized
malt
some
nuttiness
and
roasted
malt
qualities
smooth
and
nicely
lagered
fairly
clean
some
notes
of
plum
and
fig
sweet
sweet
caramel
and
molasses
malt
right
up
front
hints
of
brown
sugar
latent
notes
of
fig
and
plum
ride
into
the
finish
negligible
hops
just
an
earthy
wooden
undertone
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
hazelnut
the
mouthfeel
is
initially
brief
but
thickens
later
with
syrupy
molasses
very
very
soft
carbonation
i
thought
it
had
gone
flat
on
the
first
couple
sips
nice
enough
but
id
like
something
with
a
bit
more
presence
no
noticable
alcohol
alright
but
ive
had
better
btw
thanks
to

beer
poured
out
deep
mahogany
brownish
the
head
struggled
to
develop
but
with
an
agressive
pour
it
came
through
then
died
in
to
a
film
over
top
of
my
beer
aroma
nice
malty
but
by
no
means
over
the
top
the
taste
is
actually
more
complex
than
the
aroma
youve
got
the
standard
caramel
maltiness
but
there
are
nice
fruity
overtones
here
that
add
alot
of
depth
and
set
this
bad
boy
apart
from
the
pack
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
smooth
with
anough
carbonation
to
keep
it
full
this
a
very
drinkable
doppelbock
because
its
on
the
lighter
side
but
not
lacking
in
taste

drinkable
but
have
the
feeling
this
is
not
the
best
one
they
brought
out
cant
imagine
this
buttersmell
is
wanted
will
give
it
a
new
try
and
hopefully
get
a
better
brew
next
time
taste
was
pretty
nice
for
a
doppel
not
as
much
roasted
flavor
as
say
salvator
but
malty
with
a
nice
hint
of
vanilla
seemed
a
little
flat
but
i
may
try
it
again
if
convinced
its
a
brandnew
bottle
mouthfeel
is
dissapointing
for
a
dopple
definately
on
the
thin
side
carbonation
is
ok
soft
and
smooth
at
least
finish
starts
of
with
a
touch
of
caramel
malts
fading
into
those
funky
hops
hops
have
no
real
character
just
bitterness
this
beer
is
most
definately
past
its
prime
and
may
actually
have
been
enjoyable
whan
it
was
fresh
at
its
best
it
would
still
be
mediorcre
poured
dark
amber
500
ml
bottle
at
new
years
eve
tasting
one
of
my
least
favorite
for
the
evening
although
i
liked
the
label
of
the
two
bucks
ramming
antlers
into
each
other
okay
carbonation
and
head
rentention
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
caramel
scents
not
a
great
aftertaste
very
average
furthermore
a
bit
shy
on
the
nose
somewhat
earthy
or
woody
in
a
sense
the
malt
backbone
is
good
but
not
assertive
or
alluring
a
decent
doppel
liked
the
bottle
and
label
design
though
of
the
four
doppelbocks
i
drank
in
a
three
day
span
this
was
assuredly
the
least
impressive
versus
arbor
terminator
spaten
optimator
and
ayinger
celebrator
it
poured
a
dark
yet
opaque
brown
with
a
minimal
amount
of
tan
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
fine
mix
of
toasted
sour
malt
and
dark
fruits
it
has
a
rich
taste
of
toasted
malt
it
abounds
with
coffe
and
toffee
flavors
with
just
a
hint
of
cherry
and
has
a
dry
sweet
finish
maybe
my
bottle
had
lost
some
carbonation
as
it
was
a
little
flat
it
was
a
light
to
medium
body
and
dry
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
more
closely
resembles
an
irish
dry
stout
than
any
dopplebock
ive
had
a
nice
beer
with
some
promise
if
i
can
find
it
again
ill
have
to
give
it
a
try
this
is
a
dark
amber
beer
with
a
small
beige
head
that
fades
in
a
short
while
the
aroma
is
a
sweet
malty
smell
with
a
strong
molasses
backbone
and
just
a
hint
of
sourness
the
taste
is
a
good
bock
molasses
malty
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
but
warming
after
the
swallow
a
nice
bock
chewy
malts
along
with
a
big
body
notes
of
hazelnut
caramel
cream
plums
mixed
nuts
and
currants
nice
juicy
malty
sweetness
flavorful
brew
pours
with
a
onefinger
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
some
lace
deep
clear
amber
color
very
low
carbonation
nose
is
malty
medium
bodied
starts
sweet
raisiny
very
smooth
the
alcohol
just
comes
through
in
the
aftertaste
3
00
for
a
500ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
david
and
i
shared
this
bottle
little
worried
as
the
swing
top
came
open
without
any
struggle
whatsoever
but
relief
when
i
saw
that
there
was
carbonation
in
the
glass
overall
i
would
say
it
was
a
wee
bit
flat
however
no
head
to
speak
of
color
was
of
root
beer
aroma
was
of
alcohol
some
roasted
and
malt
notes
mouthfeel
was
thinner
than
expected
i
would
give
it
a
medium
taste
is
of
roasted
maltiness
with
some
alcohol
to
scare
me
in
the
finish
actually
i
thought
the
alcohol
was
more
present
in
the
aroma
than
in
the
taste
but
at
that
abv
i
was
going
to
get
some
either
way
not
oustanding
nice
deep
ruby
brown
color
little
or
no
carbonation
and
certainly
no
head
to
speak
of
malty
aromasomewhat
vinuous
treacle
like
malt
sweetness
dominates
the
flavor
treacle
like
in
tatse
as
well
burnt
currants
ok
mouthfeeli
like
em
a
bit
chewier
myself
a
decent
enough
beer
to
trytheres
better
ones
out
there
a
very
nice
effort
not
nearly
as
chewy
as
an
andechs
or
a
paulaner
but
eminently
more
drinkable
for
it
a
couple
of
liters
of
this
would
leave
me
a
happy
boy
the
lighter
body
makes
this
very
drinkable
for
a
doppelbock
certainly
not
as
heavy
or
filling
as
its
more
celebratored
cousins
definitelyworth
a
try
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
creamy
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
roasted
barley
and
crystal
malts
very
sweet
smelling
the
taste
is
great
as
well
it
has
a
rich
sweet
and
toastey
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
creamy
it
has
a
slight
warmth
to
it
but
nothing
too
bad
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
doppelbock
it
has
excellent
flavor
and
aroma
a
good
sessions
brew
i
much
prefer
the
tucher
bajuvator
for
a
traditional
german
doppelbock
kind
of
a
prune
juice
brown
with
a
very
weak
fleeting
head
the
aroma
is
that
prunelike
doppelbock
aroma
that
many
doppels
have
and
plenty
of
sweet
malt
the
flavor
is
mostly
brown
sugar
and
caramel
theres
not
a
lot
of
complexity
in
this
one
its
a
bit
on
the
flat
side
while
not
being
all
that
great
its
also
not
all
that
bad
drinkability
notes
quite
complex
with
a
delicious
readiness
to
it
i
dont
know
whether
to
sip
this
or
quaff
it

then
the
malt
and
alcohol
reminds
me
it
is
a
bigger
brew
went
very
well
with
the
buffalo
burger
with
mild
cheddar
on
a
bulky
roll
drinkability
i
dont
know
that
this
rates
as
a
good
doppelbock
but
its
a
good
beer
its
how
i
imagine
a
really
good
malty
mild
ale
should
taste
pours
a
dark
brownish
amber
with
a
minimal
beige
head
and
very
little
lacing
strong
caramel
and
malt
in
the
aroma
mediumbodied
with
a
kind
of
slick
mouthfeel
toasted
malt
caramel
and
sour
fruit
in
flavors
the
finish
is
both
creamy
and
fruity
a
fair
doppelbock
but
it
is
a
little
too
glassysmooth
throughout
pours
a
nice
amber
brown
with
tan
head
that
falls
to
cap
smells
of
toasted
malt
caramel
a
touch
of
hops
tastes
creamy
malt
and
caramel
touch
of
the
bitterness
to
excite
decent
enough
but
not
the
richness
of
a
other
dopplebocks
i
have
sampled
medium
slightly
heavy
side
of
mouthfeel
alcohol
warming
your
belly
drinkable
beer
but
there
are
better
choices
for
this
style
overall
this
is
very
drinkable
light
yet
flavorful
not
too
much
to
think
about
here
just
an
easy
drinking
beer
nice
dark
color
mahogany
at
best
thick
fat
foam
no
headlace
sweet
malt
aroma
caramel
and
cane
sugar
maybe
plums
on
the
nose
taste
is
sweet
malt
flavor
with
tones
of
dark
fruit
a
bit
bready
flavor
easy
to
drink
and
it
hides
the
alcohol
very
nice
nothing
overwhelming
with
this
brew
average
at
best
soso
appearance
root
beerlike
hue
and
nothing
in
the
way
of
a
head
the
taste
begins
with
a
bangstrong
doppelbock
flavor
with
a
balanced
sweetnessbut
quickly
tapers
off
so
does
the
mouthfeel
in
fact
it
goes
from
syrup
to
watery
in
about
4
5
sips
a
decent
beer
to
be
sure
but
presumably
just
like
that
of
the
entangled
bucks
on
the
label
its
energy
simply
deflates
this
was
a
good
beer
but
nothing
super
crazy
i
found
it
to
be
similar
to
most
doppels
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
but
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
out
there
if
you
know
what
i
mean
the
appearance
was
nice
with
the
caramel
color
that
got
darker
as
you
went
closer
to
the
top
its
head
was
nice
and
frothy
at
first
but
then
died
out
to
a
laceing
eventually
going
into
nothing
it
had
a
deep
fruitmalt
taste
with
little
hop
there
i
wasnt
really
looking
for
any
hoppiness
though
since
it
is
a
doppel
the
bottle
had
a
kick
ass
logo
something
that
would
make
a
good
tattoo
drinkability
i
dont
believe
this
was
a
bad
bottle
since
the
place
i
got
it
from
knows
their
stuff
the
distributor
is
primarily
a
wine
house
but
then
again
the
rep
in
the
store
buys
kegs
of
duchesse
bourgogne
for
his
own
consumption
so
they
at
least
pay
attention
to
the
product
overall
a
handicapped
pedestrian
attempt
at
a
doppelbock
at
least
it
was
cheap
and
the
cat
seemed
to
like
it
smells
green
with
a
fat
malty
body
deep
walnut
brown
headless
and
still
the
taste
has
a
caramelmolasses
sweetness
and
is
buttery
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
a
complimentary
bitterness
never
emerged
also
it
seemed
a
little
flat
to
me
though
its
difficult
to
say
just
how
much
the
character
of
this
beer
might
have
changed
since
leaving
the
brewery
in
the
bavarian
alps
i
suspect
the
ceramic
swing
top
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
this
the
lack
of
carbonation
creates
a
heaviness
in
the
mouthfeel
which
comes
across
as
weighted
but
serene
pours
with
a
decent
white
foamhead
about
a
finger
deep
fades
quickly
and
spottily
leaving
an
okay
collar
no
real
cling
beer
is
penny
copper
in
color
slightly
luminous
aroma
starts
very
sweet
with
more
caramel
than
toffee
then
a
butteriness
lacking
a
biscuitbread
backbone
and
finally
strong
acridity
in
the
sinus
there
is
little
body
to
the
nosefeel
the
aromas
skim
across
the
top
of
the
nasal
cavity
without
filling
it
flavor
starts
off
cloyingly
sweet
but
is
quickly
pushed
aside
by
a
very
minerally
body
like
limestone
and
butter
seriously
then
the
acridness
returns
and
really
lingers
not
necessarily
unpleasant
flavors
but
they
are
not
wellbalanced
thin
prickly
somehow
greasy
mouthfeel
is
very
very
twangy
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
drinkability
starts
out
okay
but
is
impaired
by
the
imbalances
and
my
growing
disinterest
at
least
the
alcohol
is
welldisguised
not
awful
but
nowhere
even
near
worth
the
5
50
i
paid
for
a
12
liter
bottle
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
decent
head
that
went
away
pretty
quickly
scents
of
dried
fruits
and
dark
malty
bread
taste
was
just
ok
typical
dopplebock
malty
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
undercarbonated
leading
to
believe
that
the
seal
had
been
comprimised
the
drinkability
was
ok
overall
there
are
78
dopplebocks
i
can
think
of
that
i
would
rather
have
than
this
one
this
beer
came
in
a
halfliter
bottle
with
a
swingtype
top
sweet
malty
distinctively
dopplebockesque
aromas
escape
on
the
pour
appearance
is
a
deep
mahogany
color
in
a
clear
nearly
still
liquid
slight
creamy
head
that
quickly
disappearsi
shouldnt
have
been
surprised
since
the
carbonation
is
negligible
toasted
malt
flavor
throughout
pleasing
dopplebock
sweetness
but
not
as
well
matched
with
the
aroma
as
a
celebrator
or
salvator
also
the
beer
is
a
little
lighter
bodied
than
a
topnotch
dopplebock
slightly
annoying
metallic
tinge
finish
is
lingering
but
not
really
cloying
the
bottom
line
is
that
this
is
a
decent
but
not
outstanding
example
of
the
style
not
very
drinkable
not
something
id
try
again
not
a
good
doppelbock
not
malty
enough
too
many
off
flavors
not
something
id
even
like
without
weighing
as
a
doppelbock
poured
a
chestnut
brown
with
a
thin
head
the
smell
was
all
sweet
malt
sugary
sweet
and
the
taste
was
much
the
same
plum
and
caramel
flavors
predominate
paired
with
a
hunk
of
parmesan
regiano
made
for
a
nice
contrast
good
body
nice
for
the
style
the
fairly
high
abv
was
well
disguised
good
beer
for
an
occasional
but
couldnt
do
too
many
more
than
two
maybe
three
the
most
obvious
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
cool
bottle
another
great
find
at
my
local
farm
market
that
decided
to
become
a
craft
beer
store
no
complaints
here
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
chocolatey
malty
nose
with
a
medium
bodied
malty
taste
not
the
most
overpowering
of
the
style
but
a
keeper
none
the
less
taste
is
very
smooth
for
a
bigger
beer
7
2
lower
in
carbonation
than
i
expected
for
this
style
of
beer
i
wouldnt
say
undercarbonated
just
not
what
i
expected
the
ending
has
a
great
balance
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
will
share
with
friends
dark
brown
yet
very
transluscent
the
head
quickly
subsided
when
first
poured
it
had
a
slight
fruitiness
banana
once
the
head
subsided
it
has
the
malt
sweet
raisin
aroma
the
flavor
is
malt
and
alcohol
it
is
sweet
on
the
tongue
and
then
fades
into
caramel
and
alcohol
in
the
finish
the
body
is
big
and
round
the
drinkability
would
be
higher
is
there
was
not
so
much
alcohol
in
the
finish
drinkability

if
you
know
and
love
doppelbock
this
is
not
for
you
another
sticky
sweet
doppelbock
soy
caramel
toffee
with
some
roastynessburntness
and
some
chocolate
not
much
in
the
finish
minimal
bitterness
too
upfront
and
sweet
sometimes
this
style
really
impresses
me
andechser
celebrator
and
other
times
its
one
of
my
least
favourite
dark
beer
styles
but
some
nice
flavours
i
thought
this
was
a
good
doppelbock
but
nothing
exceptional
poured
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
big
tan
head
smell
was
dark
and
toasty
with
hints
of
dark
fruits
and
molasses
taste
was
dark
toasty
and
a
little
bit
chewy
but
not
as
complex
as
some
doppels
ive
had
this
beer
sneaks
up
on
you
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
amount
of
alcohol
it
has
and
i
think
a
number
of
them
could
have
quite
an
effect
on
you
a
clear
mahogany
body
is
capped
by
a
short
head
of
dense
tan
foam
which
fades
away
shortly
but
maintains
a
creamy
collar
and
initially
leaves
some
minor
spotty
lace
although
the
nose
is
somewhat
restrained
and
lacks
the
rich
munich
malts
found
in
many
examples
ie
optimator
it
is
fairly
complex
with
a
gentle
touch
of
fruit
apple
soft
prune
mild
background
cherry
deeply
caramelized
sugars
and
a
waft
of
mineral
character
in
the
mouth
its
very
fine
carbonation
gently
tingles
the
tongue
thinning
and
smoothing
out
the
mediumjustborderingonfull
body
the
flavor
delivers
some
light
fruit
upfront
followed
by
a
rich
deeply
toasted
and
caramelized
molasseslike
maltiness
as
it
warms
across
the
palate
the
bitterness
is
quite
evident
beneath
the
malt
at
this
point
suggesting
that
it
will
finish
bone
dry
yet
it
oddly
fades
away
as
the
sweet
but
deeply
toasted
malt
steps
forward
to
linger
on
the
palate
its
crisp
and
refreshing
then
as
the
malt
erodes
and
some
dark
fruit
steps
back
in
leaving
an
impressive
and
complex
finish
a
very
unique
doppelbock
that
holds
enough
malt
to
satisfy
and
is
exceptionally
wellbalanced
the
alcohol
is
very
wellhidden
and
except
for
the
fact
that
it
does
eventually
hit
you
this
is
a
really
drinkable
doppelbock
most
impressive
522
the
beer
pours
an
unambiguous
mahogany
color
with
the
head
light
tan
and
miniscule
in
size
the
residual
lace
patchy
the
nose
is
plummish
caramel
sweet
and
underpinned
by
the
malt
fresh
and
pleasant
i
would
say
start
is
cloyingly
sweet
loaded
with
malt
the
top
is
middling
in
its
feel
finish
has
a
delicate
hop
spicy
bite
the
acidity
assertive
and
the
aftertaste
dry
and
linger
a
celebrator
or
optimator
it
aint
but
drinkable
nonetheless
quite
drinkable
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
most
cold
nights
clear
deep
ruby
color
fairdecent
head
following
a
vigorous
pour
aroma
consists
of
dark
ripe
fruit
toasted
caramel
molasses
and
chocolate
the
flavors
are
intensifying
as
this
warms
more
pronounced
are
the
chocolate
malt
and
dark
fruits
which
have
become
more
defined
prunelike
alcohol
warms
the
throat
a
good
doppelbock
will
leave
you
feeling
as
if
youve
just
had
a
treat
and
this
one
is
no
exception
very
nice
redish
brown
in
color
this
doppelbock
look
more
like
a
salvator
then
an
optimator
it
has
a
nice
body
to
it
but
it
could
be
better
although
it
doesnt
have
the
richness
of
an
optimator
it
have
a
beautifully
deep
and
complex
malt
small
bitter
to
balance
and
a
nice
little
fruityness
all
and
all
a
good
upstanding
doppel
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
many
complex
flavors
not
sugary
but
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
the
finish
medium
abv
at
8
2
so
a
couple
of
these
is
all
you
need
nice
head
when
poured
from
a
tap
rich
color
low
bitterness
at
25ibus
just
a
great
all
around
beer
great
beer
easy
to
drink
say
it
with
me
round
of
troegenator
im
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
one
although
a
complex
and
flavorful
beer
some
elements
of
it
are
slightly
off
putting
i
was
particularly
bothered
by
the
burnt
malt
flavor
and
booziness
the
finish
left
a
medicinally
boozy
aftertaste
that
reminded
me
of
jaegermeister
which
i
do
not
like
i
was
looking
forward
to
having
this
one
because
i
love
doppelbock
i
will
give
it
another
chance
however
it
does
not
look
like
it
measures
up
to
other
german
doppelbocks
ive
had
fantastic
brew
malty
with
the
right
balance
of
bitterness
and
alcohol
prescience
taste
is
malty
almost
drylike
and
satisfying
wellbalanced
flavor
profile
for
a
beer
of
this
style
the
8
2
seems
to
be
well
covered
up
as
i
dont
notice
the
alcohol
so
much
this
is
a
tasty
beer
i
like
this
style
a
lot
but
this
is
definitely
in
the
better
half
of
dopplebocks
that
ive
tried
this
beer
was
dark
heavy
and
filling
strong
caramel
i
was
not
a
big
fan
enjoyable
filling
felt
heavy
on
the
pallete
appearance
pours
a
beautiful
deep
amber
brown
in
color
tight
lacing
that
clings
to
the
inside
of
my
glass
good
carbonation
bubbles
aroma
is
of
some
deep
raisin
and
figs
the
hops
are
subtle
and
mild
with
a
slight
grass
tone
coming
through
the
taste
is
as
advertised
a
huge
malt
base
with
hints
of
rum
honey
and
slight
licorice
mouthfeel
is
medium
carbonation
with
a
nice
malt
base
that
holds
up
on
the
tongue
well
without
breaking
down
overall
an
impressive
doppel
with
just
the
right
amount
of
flavor
complexity
combined
with
a
nice
abv
to
warm
the
soul
will
seek
out
again
now
that
troegs
is
available
in
the
great
state
of
ct
o
love
the
style
been
a
way
on
a
visit
to
ipaland
for
a
while
glad
to
revisit
this
is
a
good
representation
overall
a
fantastic
dopplebock
and
on
par
with
ones
made
from
germany
i
cant
think
of
better
one
and
highly
recommend
it
to
everyone
solid
did
not
care
for
at
all
more
of
a
whiskey
kind
of
after

hard
to
discribe
lite

strong

finsh
good
bock
overall
received
a
selection
box
of
troegs
beers
for
christmas
and
this
is
by
far
my
favourite
nice
rich
flavour
on
tap
tastes
a
bit
off
not
as
sweet
as
a
typical
bock
not
awful
just
kinda
weird
lots
of
malt
natch
but
pretty
sugary
and
wheres

months

id
have
thought
doppelbocks
would
age
well
but
maybe
not
not
the
best
example
of
troegs
or
the
style
3
75
overall
this
is
a
very
good
american
version
of
a
german
doppelbock
malty
sweet
lots
of
flavors
of
dried
stone
fruit
and
slightly
bitter
this
beer
is
very
reminiscent
of
german
doppelbocks
recommended
to
doppelbock
fans
nice
head
which
fades
but
leave
nice
lacing
malty
but
a
aftertaste
that
just
didnt
sit
well
not
sure
i
would
have
another
overall
this
is
a
very
good
dopplebock
close
to
some
of
the
better
german
dopplebocks
we
really
like
this
one
the
balance
of
hops
was
perfectly
crafted
we
will
be
getting
a
second
round
of
this
one
for
sure
perfect
for
frozen
weather
strong
maltiness
melanoidins
with
some
toastiness
very
rich
almost
a
subtle
milk
choco
almost
ruby
in
color
could
use
a
bit
more
lager
crispness
bland
not
very
flavorful
deep
red
color
good
smooth
finish
enjoyable
and
not
over
powering
this
thing
is
beautiful
in
the
glass
and
has
the
malt
backbone
to
easily
hide
the
over
8
i
loved
the
rich
dark
fruits
flavor
with
just
a
nice
subtle
burn
from
the
alcohol
very
good
bock
top
ten
that
i
have
had
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
amber
highlights
aroma
is
very
much
what
i
like
primarily
breadcrusty
type
malty
notes
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
lingering
sweetness
on
the
back
end
perhaps
too
much
the
bready
notes
are
all
there
though
which
is
a
big
plus
not
much
feel
to
this
one
i
expected
more
touch
of
body
on
the
front
end
but
with
a
watery
finish
expected
more
feel
throughout
good
beer
no
question
but
not
among
the
best
ive
had
on
tap
at
troegs
too
sweet
for
me
probably
an
excellent
double
bock
need
to
have
more
of
the
to
rate
this
properly
should
have
again
a
good
solid
beer
to
drink
overall
fantastic
double
bock
this
is
a
good
one
full
of
flavor
and
complexity
probably
the
tastiest
bock
i
have
had
it
feels
like
i
am
in
bavaria
at
a
monastery
the
taste
is
incredibly
sweet
and
malty
with
a
moderate
bitter
finish
it
is
quite
tasty
utterly
disappointing
tastes
like
they
dumped
in
extra
flavored
like
caramel
instead
of
having
them
form
naturally
o
solid
indeed
for
a
us
crack
at
a
doppelbock
it
could
stand
a
bit
more
fruit
character
to
round
out
the
flavor
profile
but
overall
not
bad
very
good
and
shall
be
repeated
on
my
next
visit
bod
81314
beautiful
clear
dark
amber
pour
that
has
a
heavy
dose
of
dark
ruby
making
it
almost
red
normal
head
lacing
and
slightly
below
normal
retention
light
nose
of
caramel
malt
with
bread
undertones
coupled
with
a
light
alcohol
note
as
it
warms
dark
fruit
notes
fig
raisin
plum
are
noted
full
bodied
with
a
rich
creamy
texture
normal
carbonation
with
a
nice
effervescence
on
the
finish
the
flavor
profile
is
well
balanced
and
complex
it
begins
with
a
bready
malt
that
flows
into
the
dark
fruit
notes
in
the
middle
caramel
sweetness
comes
forward
then
yields
to
a
mild
hop
bitterness
the
finish
is
where
the
alcohol
becomes
a
bit
unhidden
as
the
other
flavors
fade
tis
the
season
now
for
this
monster
one
of
the
better
bocks
in
the
game
i
think
and
truly
a
genre
defining
beer
for
many
and
rightfully
so
this
is
big
sticky
brown
with
a
tanned
head
on
it
that
doesnt
budge
its
enormously
viscous
with
notes
of
molasses
and
dark
dried
fruit
being
the
dominant
aromas
chocolate
malt
may
be
in
there
up
front
in
the
flavor
its
dry
before
its
sweet
but
when
it
gets
sweet
it
gets
real
sweet
maple
and
brown
sugar
and
sticky
bread
pudding
all
come
from
rich
darker
german
malts
the
finish
is
long
and
just
a
little
hot
a
pint
or
a
bottle
of
this
is
an
interesting
proposition
one
has
you
stoked
and
feeling
amazing
enough
to
make
you
want
another
then
it
gets
you
buzzed
and
too
mellow
to
know
your
full
and
well
on
the
way
to
drunkenness
a
third
is
night
night
for
many
time
to
get
weird
for
others
but
if
you
are
having
a
fourth
in
one
session
you
will
inevitably
exhibit
your
inebriation
in
an
unflattering
way
just
the
way
it
is
with
this
seasonal
staple
surprisingly
nice
this
was
a
real
good
fullflavored
beer
to
have
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
that
i
dont
live
in
the
areas
that
it
is
normally
distributed
o
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
brew
but
definitely
more
of
a
slow
sipper
and
one
that
i
could
only
have
a
single
glass
during
an
evening
it
is
pretty
big
even
though
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
great
taste
sweet
and
good
allow
it
to
reach
close
to
room
temperature
and
a
lot
more
of
the
body
and
flavor
of
the
beer
will
reveal
itself
cheers
cheers
very
tasty
dopplebock
the
fizzy
head
and
no
lacing
detract
from
the
appearance
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
from
the
appearance
to
the
aroma
to
the
taste
delicious
beautiful
coloring
the
taste
and
smell
of
the
malt
and
the
caramel
is
great
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
regardless
of
their
taste
preferences
overall
not
really
my
type
of
beer
this
but
its
good
nonetheless
definitely
something
i
could
drink
again
and
enjoy
o
very
well
done
doublebock
great
on
all
sides
and
balanced
drank
june
10
2014
in
clearfield
pa
i
enjoy
this
beer
and
find
it
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
this
is
the
first
dopplebock
ive
tried
so
ill
rate
it
more
generally
as
a
beer
and
not
as
a
dopplebock
it
is
a
very
good
beer
its
got
me
interested
in
the
style
now
overall
the
smell
of
this
one
was
very
good
but
the
mouthfeel
lacked
a
little
i
think
i
may
have
drank
this
one
too
cold
and
will
surely
revisit
at
the
right
temp
to
get
a
better
guess
o
ive
heard
so
much
about
this
beer
and
havent
had
too
many
doppelbocks
but
this
doesnt
taste
like
any
of
the
ones
that
ive
had
sorry
troegs
not
a
fan
o
have
not
had
a
ton
of
double
bocks
in
my
day
but
this
is
one
tasty
brew
if
your
in
the
mood
for
a
sweet
malty
beer
pick
this
one
up
if
you
can
its
worth
a
try
really
enjoyed
this
one
cheers
this
may
well
be
my
favorite
offering
from
tröegs
even
gasp
better
in
my
opinion
than
nugget
nectar
i
like
bocks
they
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
lagers
for
their
color
and
flavor
and
doppelbocks
are
very
tasty
this
one
is
no
exception
i
bought
this
around
christmas
time
yeah
yeah
i
should
have
gotten
some
mad
elf
but
i
wasnt
too
familiar
with
tröegs
at
the
time
altogether
this
a
good
beer
for
many
different
applications
it
is
a
little
bit
high
gravity
to
be
a
perfect
session
beer
but
the
flavor
is
both
strong
and
not
intrusive
with
plenty
of
the
malt
characteristic
that
i
like
and
the
hoppiness
i
expect
from
tröegs
though
not
as
much
as
in
nugget
nectar
or
something
like
that
good
for
before
during
and
after
dinner
and
very
good
as
the
first
alcoholic
thing
i
drank
after
finishing
my
wisdom
teeth
pain
medication
o
i
enjoy
bocks
and
the
rest
of
the
lager
family
but
doppelbocks
arent
my
favorite
just
a
little
too
harsh
for
my
taste
the
troegenator
is
actually
a
decent
double
bock
dont
let
me
put
this
down
for
you
for
me
i
find
that
the
flavor
isnt
balanced
enough
with
hops
to
compensate
for
the
high
alcohol
content
for
the
style
this
beer
is
above
average
but
it
can
be
found
pretty
much
anywhere
if
youre
a
fan
of
highgravity
lagers
check
this
one
out
good
but
it
takes
a
few
sips
to
get
used
to
ive
had
a
few
other
dbocks
lately
but
theyve
been
the
hypersmooth
big
boys
celebrator
and
optimator
and
im
not
used
to
one
thats
as
rough
around
the
edges
as
this
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
double
bocks
well
done
fellas
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
enjoy
i
like
this
double
bock
it
has
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
and
a
rich
tan
head
that
holds
up
pretty
well
with
lots
of
lacing
you
only
get
that
nice
head
if
you
serve
it
cool
not
ice
cold
the
flavor
and
aroma
also
open
up
when
its
about
45
degrees
its
malty
and
fruity
and
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
with
an
abv
of
8
2
if
you
have
tried
it
ice
cold
and
didnt
like
it
i
would
recommend
that
you
let
it
warm
a
bit
and
try
it
again
it
is
my
go
to
beer
for
now
just
an
ok
beer
felt
like
it
was
missing
something
that
i
couldnt
figure
out
overall
i
thought
this
was
quite
satisfying
to
have
a
beer
with
over
8
abv
covering
that
fact
up
so
well
and
adding
nice
complexity
is
a
solid
craft
no
wonder
the
ratings
for
this
troegs
offering
rank
at
the
top
of
the
doppelbock
style
troegs
nailed
it
since
it
is
so
heavy
it
may
not
be
a
beer
that
is
bought
often
but
is
a
must
try
for
sure
overall
it
is
not
the
best
doppelbock
i
have
had
but
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
this
is
an
ignorantasallhell
review
because
im
not
sure
ive
had
a
doppelbock
before
from
what
i
know
about
them
this
is
what
id
expected
i
didnt
think
id
love
them
and
i
dont
love
this
beer
however
the
feel
on
this
beer
is
great
and
its
very
drinkable
at
8
im
just
not
high
on
the
style
simply
because
i
find
it
or
at
least
this
beer
relatively
uninteresting
i
reiterate
again
its
still
enjoyable
and
very
well
crafted
without
a
doubt
a
great
choice
for
people
who
love
sweet
malty
brews
would
definitely
recommend
for
winter
sessions
overall
for
me
the
flavors
were
lacking
do
that
the
most
discernable
tadte
was
alchohal
which
isnt
too
pleasant
i
cant
see
myself
buying
this
again
and
i
had
higher
hopes
from
this
brewery
overall
mmmmm
im
starting
to
enjoy
doppelbocks
especially
during
this
blizzard
here
in
boston
o
im
not
wowed
by
this
and
its
definitely
not
troegs
star
brew
but
its
not
bad
by
any
means
the
flavors
arent
overly
complex
but
theyre
satisfying
and
it
offers
exceptional
drinkability
its
dangerous
in
the
sense
that
its
flavorful
and
feels
sessionable
even
though
its
donning
an
8
2
abv
not
outstanding
but
id
recommend
it
to
fans
of
the
style
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
if
you
can
overall

i
have
to
agree
with
the
majority
of
people
that
this
is
among
the
best
american
interpretations
of
the
german
doppelbock
style
while
there
arent
that
many
domestic
breweries
that
have
put
their
spin
on
it
to
begin
with
troegenator
is
simply
put
a
damn
good
beer
thats
great
during
the
cold
months
and
a
great
alternative
to
an
imperial
stout
if
youre
burned
out
on
that
style
but
still
want
something
big
and
dark
in
your
glass
i
plan
on
going
on
a
bockdoublebock
tare
this
spring
i
will
return
to
the
troegenator
overall
a
fanastic
double
bock
o
overall
a
nice
doppelbock
id
take
celebrator
over
this
one
it
is
a
good
warming
winter
brew
that
id
have
again
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
dopplebock
compares
well
with
weienstephaner
korbinian
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
glass
it
has
a
dark
mahogany
color
body
with
no
head
the
aroma
is
of
dark
fruit
and
raisin
the
taste
has
malt
back
bone
and
has
a
dark
cherry
and
raisin
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
overall
is
a
good
beer
this
style
is
not
one
ts
o
very
inviting
look
dark
fruit
scenttaste
great
warming
sensation
for
cold
weather
very
smooth
very
proud
to
live
in
pennsylvania
overall
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
complex
malt
and
fruit
and
a
bit
tastier
finish
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
great
two
glasses
was
more
than
enough
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
its
better
than
some
double
bocks
and
something
i
may
seek
out
again
tried
it
a
bit
warmer
and
in
a
bottle
and
updated
my
rating
good
second
or
third
beer
after
a
rich
stout
o
a
tasty
rather
belgianish
dopplebock
o
for
my
money
still
the
best
muricanmade
doppelbock
on
the
market
there
are
many
occasions
in
fact
where
id
even
drink
this
over
celebrator
this
is
such
a
great
wintertime
staple
i
really
wonder
why
i
havent
made
it
happen
that
is
stock
it
regularly
for
real
i
had
this
before
from
a
bottle
but
the
legendary
woodychandler
hit
me
off
with
a
can
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
pretty
crimson
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
caramel
taste
is
bready
malty
alcohol
is
present
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
tasty
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
quality
brew
worth
checking
out
this
was
the
first
brew
i
tried
by
the
troegs
brothers
and
it
instantly
became
one
of
my
favorites
coming
in
at
8
2
abv
it
certainly
packs
a
punch
but
without
overkill
it
has
quite
strong
characteristics
from
smell
to
mouthfeel
but
being
a
double
bock
that
is
to
be
expected
having
tried
many
of
the
other
brews
troegs
makes
i
have
found
i
am
not
a
big
fan
in
general
but
their
troegenator
double
bock
is
definitely
worth
giving
a
shot
it
must
be
humorous
somehow
to
put
a
highgravity
beer
like
this
into
a
tallboy
the
crack
was
loud
and
the
inverted
glug
required
the
practiced
hand
of
the
can
master
to
cantrol
from
an
overflow
i
had
an
initial
two
fingers
of
foamy
lighttan
head
before
it
began
to
fall
leaving
great
lacing
in
its
wake
color
was
a
deepruby
or
garnet
the
exold
lady
and
i
also
had
that
debate
during
my
visit
srm
27
34
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
rich
with
dried
dark
fruits
like
raisins
prunes
and
dates
along
with
a
freshbaked
breadiness
i
could
envision
fruitcake
from
when
my
maternal
grandmother
used
to
bake
it
it
had
an
earthy
richness
to
it
that
likewise
put
me
in
mind
of
bb
brown
bread
also
in
a
can
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
very
much
like
brown
bread
with
raisins
i
like
slicing
off
a
piece
putting
it
in
the
microwave
briefly
putting
some
butter
on
it
and
then
eating
it
the
bread
i
mean
the
beer
probably
would
not
be
as
enjoyable
coming
out
of
the
mike
but
it
was
darn
tasty
coming
out
of
both
the
fridge
and
my
fridge
i
really
did
not
notice
the
alcohol
until
the
finish
when
i
got
a
slight
burning
tickle
in
the
back
of
my
throat
the
beer
hides
its
abv
well
which
can
be
a
dangerous
thing
if
you
are
not
careful
the
finish
also
left
me
tasting
caramel
along
with
the
fruit
and
it
just
occurred
to
me
molasses
wow
this
is
definitely
a
rich
beer
and
on
a
cold
day
like
today
it
was
just
the
ticket
before
hitting
the
hay
o
still
just
as
great
as
the
first
time
i
had
it
quite
a
few
years
ago
such
an
approachable
beer
while
still
having
some
rather
intense
flavors
o
first
beer
ive
had
in
almost
two
weeks
and
not
a
very
memorable
one
to
come
back
to
the
relatively
high
abv
8
2
isnt
noticeable
but
then
again
very
little
about
this
beer
is
o
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
i
dont
like
it
quite
as
much
as
the
one
from
andechs
but
its
not
far
behind
good
stuff
my
favorite
beer
from
the
troegs
brewery
generally
i
dont
prefer
a
beer
this
sweet
but
the
malty
profile
is
absolutely
delicious
and
it
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
for
a
brew
of
such
high
abv
as
i
said
it
may
be
on
the
sweet
side
for
some
but
its
definitely
worth
a
try
for
fans
of
any
style
probably
one
of
the
most
drinkable
heavy
beers
even
for
people
who
generally
dont
like
something
this
strong
a
fantastic
beer
overall
this
is
quite
sweet
not
too
sweet
but
its
close
it
seems
more
like
a
belgium
than
a
doppelbock
from
the
ripe
fruit
smell
to
the
tangy
grape
on
the
back
sides
of
the
tongue
a
dark
fruity
sweetness
dominates
the
drink
dont
get
me
wrong
its
very
delicious
i
would
probably
get
this
again
i
will
say
this
it
really
masks
the
alcohol
content
this
is
a
great
doppelbock
from
troegs
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
ive
tasted
although
i
would
like
the
aroma
to
be
a
little
more
bold
this
is
a
beer
i
would
enjoy
drinking
all
year
round
smooth
malty
and
sweet
rather
easy
drinking
for
the
8
2
abv
a
fairly
competent
doppelbock
overall
very
good
beer
i
wont
go
buying
a
case
or
anything
crazy
but
this
is
good
and
ill
grab
one
here
or
there
to
try
again
in
the
future
insanely
drinkable
no
noticeable
alcohol
cheers
oan
excellent
doppelbock
rivaling
some
of
the
german
variants
ive
had
good
beer
easy
to
drink
and
very
good
to
enjoy
in
the
fall
not
much
lacing
no
head
but
like
most
doubles
ive
tried
not
much
of
a
head
still
learning
the
craft
of
tasting
but
i
did
like
this
one
good
to
drink
with
most
foods
any
cheese
or
choclate
will
work
lol
prost
overall
tasty
but
not
spectacular
doppelbock
bottle
from
trade
pours
a
deep
dark
yet
clear
red
with
a
small
creamy
yellow
colored
head
aroma
is
sweet
malts
some
plums
cherries
brown
sugar
maybe
flavor
is
cherries
up
front
with
big
fruit
sweetness
raisins
clean
finish
not
as
hearty
as
i
expected
but
a
solid
medium
plus
mouthfeel
with
adequate
carbonation
this
drinks
really
easy
for
the
abv
basic
and
not
super
exciting
but
done
well
enough
overall
if
did
brew
my
own
beer
might
buy
on
occasion
enjoy
i
did
overall
this
beer
is
probably
my
favorite
i
love
the
rich
taste
of
it
and
living
in
harrisburg
currently
has
allowed
me
to
try
all
the
troegs
beers
in
the
tasting
room
this
is
definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
it
will
be
unlike
many
beers
you
have
ever
tried
overall
very
good
for
the
style
sorry
i
waited
to
try
this
one
as
long
as
i
have
is
there
better
yes
but
not
by
much
and
this
is
widely
available
in
my
area
definitely
a
must
try
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
ive
had
brewed
in
the
us
the
flavors
i
enjoy
are
definitely
predominant
and
the
american
citrus
peel
addition
is
a
good
change
from
the
german
clove
flavor
it
feels
like
it
lacks
more
of
that
robustness
i
crave
in
doppelbocks
and
the
alcohol
isnt
necessarily
subtle
or
anything
otherwise
its
a
strong
take
on
the
style
that
id
definitely
have
again
once
the
time
felt
right
o
overall
certainly
a
fine
double
bock
overall
for
the
alcohol
content
i
wish
there
were
stronger
flavors
going
on
but
a
really
nice
beer
and
goes
beautifully
with
food
overall
this
brew
is
nicely
styled
more
innovation
would
draw
me
back
to
it
more
frequently
but
growlers
to
go
home
for
spicy
barbecue
meals
never
disappoint
o
delicious
malt
bomb
perfection
sweet
a
little
bready
great
stuff
very
good
beer
a
tiny
bit
over
the
top
with
the
overall
intensity
but
big
flavors
that
are
welllayered
and
a
great
beer
to
have
with
robust
food
paired
with
beef
roasted
taters
and
winter
root
vegetables
held
its
own
very
well
and
complimented
the
meal
overall
very
tasty
brew
and
one
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
up
again
3
85
overall
this
fits
the
style
but
it
was
just
too
much
sweetness
for
me
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
bodied
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
mouthfeel
that
is
lightly
foamy
and
fairly
thick
and
chewy
little
to
no
ethanol
felt
in
the
nostrils
or
on
the
throat
closes
semidry
with
substantial
stickiness
lingering
on
the
lips
and
palate
typical
for
the
style
overall
i
have
to
say
i
quite
liked
it
might
be
time
to
revisit
other
doppelbocks
to
see
if
my
palate
has
changed
with
regard
to
the
style
overall
not
too
shabby
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
for
my
preference
for
this
style
but
its
no
slouch
the
aroma
and
mouthfeel
are
absolutely
top
notch
the
spicy
hop
character
almost
reminds
me
of
capitals
autumnal
fire
and
thats
a
serious
compliment
o
one
of
my
favorite
dopplebocks
an
absolute
go
to
its
complex
without
really
trying
to
be
hits
all
the
right
notes
91
one
of
troegs
best
beers
one
i
will
always
love
overall
a
tasty
complex
sweetbutnottoosweet
doppelbock
more
balanced
than
other
flavorful
dark
beers
in
that
its
neither
more
toasty
than
roasty
nor
more
sugary
than
spicy
etc
no
one
flavor
dominates
making
the
complexity
that
much
more
enjoyable
robust
but
refreshing
beer
at
the
same
time
sin

la
condura
excellent
doppelbock
complex
but
not
tiring
highly
recommended
o
double
bocks
are
not
a
common
style
these
days
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
going
a
perfect
beer
for
warming
up
on
those
cold
winter
nights
troegenator
stays
true
to
the
key
elements
of
the
style
but
offers
some
unique
flavors
as
well
o
i
wasnt
too
impressed
by
this
one
pours
dark
mahogany
with
a
vibrant
ruby
hue
a
tan
three
fingers
of
creamy
foam
sits
aloft
this
fantastic
pour
into
a
pilsner
glass
superb
retention
but
no
real
lacing
this
beer
is
very
enticing
nose
is
dark
ripe
fruits
a
little
chocolate
and
plenty
of
carmel
malt
as
it
warms
the
nose
opens
up
with
raisin
cherry
the
promise
of
a
little
spice
and
a
faint
breath
of
floral
hops
on
the
palate
the
complexity
builds
its
creamy
and
sticky
with
fruits
and
a
full
malt
presence
that
expands
with
some
biscuit
the
malt
has
depth
and
is
resilient
and
forthcoming
during
the
drink
it
finishes
sweet
and
off
dry
with
a
smacking
of
hops
bitter
to
coat
the
mouth
while
the
malt
stays
up
sweet
and
crisp
its
light
enough
to
drink
but
its
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
body
this
is
a
big
hearted
and
velvety
doopelbock
rousing
and
fat
again
troegs
does
not
disappoint
im
not
a
fan
of
this
brewery
and
this
beer
is
just
another
reason
why
this
is
a
standard
beer
that
i
think
isnt
worth
a
shot
at
overall
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
as
i
find
it
pretty
dang
good
in
the
bottle
personal
feelings
about
the
beer
aside
i
think
this
fits
into
the
style
excellently
especially
with
the
roasted
notes
and
also
pulls
off
a
pretty
amazing
cover
up
of
the
alcohol
and
provides
some
nice
roasted
notes
i
would
say
that
this
is
pert
near
being
world
class
and
gets
a
solid
4
5
out
of
5
overall
from
me
o
a
damn
good
doppelbock
ive
yet
to
meet
a
bock
i
didnt
so
obviously
im
partial
but
this
is
a
delicious
beer
highly
recommend
to
any
bock
fans
or
any
beer
fans
in
general
who
enjoy
robust
tasty
beers
with
lots
going
on
o
def
could
have
gone
for
some
frothy
head
on
this
but
maybe
its
aged
a
bit
however
the
flavor
profile
is
exactly
what
you
want
out
of
a
doppelbock
noms
the
finish
has
a
bit
of
a
nutty
aftertaste
that
i
really
got
a
lot
of
from
paulaner
salvator
however
this
has
more
aroma
rounded
flavor
and
sweet
caramel
malt
its
quite
decent
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
of
an
issue
for
me
o
3
75
dopplebocks
were
one
of
the
crossover
styles
to
craft
beer
for
me
especially
spaten
optimator
and
hookers
liberator
as
you
can
gather
from
the
above
this
one
is
particularly
malty
and
sweet
and
maybe
ive
grown
out
of
this
need
for
jolly
rancher
beers
however
there
are
redeeming
qualities
to
this
beer
that
pull
it
out
of
the
candy
house
like
it
backend
bready
malt
character
and
lager
yeast
flavors
cheers
overall
an
excellent
beer
the
taste
carries
the
beer
its
good
to
start
out
a
bit
colder
fridge
temp
then
warm
gradually
for
a
fuller
flavor
overall
i
really
dig
this
beer
its
rich
and
sweet
without
being
cloying
or
overly
heavy
the
alcohol
is
present
just
enough
to
compliment
the
malt
very
happy
with
this
one
o
a
solid
american
doppelbock
with
plenty
of
depth
and
complexity
very
warming
and
nourishing

fill
the
bill
i
prefer
their
hoppy
ales
but
this
is
very
nice
for
what
it
it
tries
to
be
i
could
get
into
this
on
a
snowy
winter
evening
especially
with
a
little
less
sweetmess
feel
medfull
bodied
thick
velvety
consistency
finish
is
very
long
as
well
as
wet
and
warming
overall
this
has
been
a
beer
ive
had
a
hard
time
saying
no
to
for
quite
some
time
but
its
one
ive
not
bought
often
perhaps
that
should
change
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
troegenator
is
a
deep
ambercrimson
color
with
a
thin
fading
head
that
dissipates
until
all
that
is
left
is
small
amounts
of
fine
carbonation
that
rise
lazily
to
the
top
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
all
malt
sweet
molasses
and
toastybready
notes
dominate
sweet
alcohol
lies
just
percievably
above
the
radar
the
flavor
is
also
all
malt
and
alcohol
i
pick
up
some
black
licorice
notes
that
i
didnt
notice
in
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
minimal
carbonation
the
finish
is
slick
and
the
alcohol
has
a
warming
sensation
overall
a
well
done
dopplebock
definitely
a
good
one
for
a
cold
winters
night
overall
nice
middle
of
the
road
sessionable
doppelbock
o
very
flavorful
and
complex
beer
its
also
a
very
drinkable
doppelbock
another
great
beer
from
troegs
o
all
in
all
a
very
solid
doppelbock
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
but
the
flavor
profiles
present
are
very
appealing
definitely
worth
drinking
again
in
front
of
the
fire
on
a
cold
day
off
o
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
while
warming
up
by
a
fire
malt
forward
yet
balanced
and
oh
so
drinkable
the
hops
bitterness
is
too
strong
for
the
style
o
a
really
enjoyable
dopplebock
a
little
sweet
but
there
is
some
balance
from
the
earthy
hops
id
reccomend
this
to
anyone
whos
a
fan
of
the
style
o
would
definitely
buy
again
a
very
nice
bock
pours
a
deep
brown
to
amber
color
decent
head
at
pour
but
disappates
to
just
around
the
rim
quickly
no
lacing
smell
is
darker
malts
with
maybe
a
hint
of
smokey
taste
is
somewhat
strong
up
front
again
malt
flavors
but
then
moves
to
a
sweeter
caramel
yet
still
somewhat
smokey
on
the
finish
nice
body
and
smaller
carbonation
overall
a
nice
bock
to
warm
you
on
a
cold
day
id
have
more
dark
and
smooth
and
smooth
and
dark
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
will
get
you
in
trouble
this
beer
pours
nice
and
dark
with
a
decent
head
and
a
dark
fruit
smell
basically
tastes
like
it
smells
with
a
plumraisin
flavor
and
medium
carbonation
i
could
drink
these
all
night
but
i
probably
shouldnt
this
is
a
really
nice
doppelbock
it
has
a
rich
deep
sweet
malt
character
and
a
complex
overall
flavor
this
was
enjoyable
throughout
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
troegenator
pours
a
dark
rudy
red
color
with
a
half
inch
caramel
head
that
disappears
after
a
minute
or
so
smells
of
candied
fruit
and
just
plain
sweetness
i
get
a
whiff
of
something
that
resembles
raspberry
jam
taste
follows
the
nose
very
sweet
with
a
nice
bready
kind
of
taste
to
it
slight
hop
presence
ties
it
all
together
slight
boozyness
lingers
which
i
guess
is
on
par
with
the
abv
i
dont
drink
this
style
too
often
but
i
cant
imagine
picking
another
of
its
ilk
over
troegenator
overall
definitely
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
out
there
very
enjoyable
and
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
overall
one
of
if
not
the
best
american
doppelbocks
quality
beer
at
an
affordable
price
this
is
also
the
beer
that
got
me
into
beer
as
i
know
it
now
poured
into
snifter
not
a
ton
of
head
but
nice
color
though
smell
is
raisiny
musty
fairly
earthy
the
taste
is
not
bad
just
not
anything
overly
spectacular
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
appealing
feels
fairly
substantial
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
not
at
the
top
of
this
great
style
category
i
would
have
again
but
i
would
maybe
look
for
other
dbocks
first
still
a
pretty
good
brewery
delicious
i
need
to
explore
this
style
more
need
a
break
from
ipas
overall
i
really
enjoyed
it
ive
got
5
more
of
them
in
the
fridge
and
im
looking
forward
to
getting
through
em
o
this
is
a
solid
doppelbock
nuff
said
oa
good
doppelbock
with
a

oz
bottle
like
i
feel
for
movies
a
great
movie
is
one
that
makes
you
watch
more
movies
in
that
genre
similarly
this
is
the
beer
that
opened
up
doppelbocks
for
me
the
appearance
was
excellent
it
poured
a
dark
brown
and
clear
color
aroma
was
very
malty
the
taste
wasnt
too
heavy
it
fit
the
double
bock
criteria
mouthfeel
was
a
medium
to
heavy
but
not
over
powering
overall
a
delicious
beer
very
hard
just
to
have
one
of
these
a
dark
reddish
brown
translucent
beer
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
aroma
was
of
toffee
and
dark
fruit
almost
a
cherry
flavor
this
beer
is
sweet
malt
upfront
with
a
raisin
or
plum
like
flavor
in
there
a
small
bit
of
hop
biterness
that
helps
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
the
beer
masks
its
high
abv
pretty
well
too
a
pretty
good
drink
overall
as
far
as
the
style
goes
its
pretty
good
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
by
the
sweet
malts
as
far
as
troegs
goes
its
quite
bland
the
beer
pours
a
gorgeous
rubied
brown
with
a
lightly
tanned
head
of
medium
sized
bubbles
which
fades
away
quickly
and
leaves
a
thin
drizzle
of
lacing
when
you
swirl
this
beer
it
leaves
nice
light
legs
of
alcohol
on
the
sides
of
my
mug
this
is
a
pretty
looking
beer
the
beer
smells
wet
with
caramel
bready
malts
dark
fruits
and
brown
sugar
there
is
even
a
slight
tint
of
chocolate
in
the
nose
and
all
around
it
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
quad
with
its
malty
complexity
there
is
a
nice
tinge
of
alcohol
in
the
back
of
the
smell
as
well
to
remind
you
of
the
beers
abv
the
beer
tastes
much
lighter
than
you
would
expect
from
the
smell
there
is
some
good
brown
sugar
maltiness
going
on
in
this
taste
which
blossoms
at
the
end
of
the
swallow
but
really
is
quite
tame
and
clean
in
the
initial
sip
dark
fruits
like
plum
and
raisin
are
also
present
and
there
is
a
lingering
hint
of
dark
chocolate
in
the
mouth
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
drinkable
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
leaving
a
nice
skim
of
saliva
and
tingle
of
the
carbonation
on
the
tongue
while
leaving
the
entire
mouth
with
a
damp
feeling
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
8
beer
with
some
lovely
sweet
malts
but
not
too
much
ive
never
had
doppelbock
before
so
im
not
quite
sure
how
to
rate
this
on
its
style
but
i
definitely
enjoy
it
this
is
a
nice
offering
from
tröeg
o
really
good
doppelbock
here
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
great
and
the
mouthfeel
is
so
smooth
solid
dopplebock
and
probably
better
than
the
average
but
nothing
ground
breaking
i
enjoyed
the
lower
malt
sweetness
level
but
still
not
something
id
have
more
than
one
of
o
an
awesome
dopplebock
prduced
close
by
at
great
price
this
is
a
frequent
purchase
for
me

deep

with
moderate
fizzy

some
sweetness
perhaps
apple

with
a
little
drying
pinch
of
something
very
drinkable
alcohol
not
noticeable
at
all
mouthfeel
is
smooth
full
yet
a

watery
this
beer
is
not
bad
very
dark
with
lots
of

and
taste
with
a
vigorous
pour
large
head
which
dissipates
very
quickly
and
no

that
is
drinkable
but
not
is
you
dont
like
molasses
which
is
not
high
on
my
list
decent
beer
overall
good
effort
overall
appealing
raisin
and
caramel
aroma
and
flavor
sweetness
is
to
style
but
is
more
cloying
than
i
prefer
fans
of
sweeter
beers
will
be
pleased
o
i
have
had
this
beer
once
before
and
thought
it
was
good
the
first
time
drinking
it
out
of
the
bottle
not
so
much
now
that
ive
had
it
in
the
glass
the
alcohol
is
not
hidden
at
all
and
there
is
not
a
lot
of
malt
character
here
this
is
a
soso
beer
for
me
nice
dopplebock
full
of
malt
flavor
and
sweetness
lightly
toasted
sweet
slight
caramel
no
roasted
or
burnt
flavors
very
malty
low
hop
flavor
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
the
beer
its
a
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
slim
quickly
fading
offwhite
head
clear
the
aroma
could
be
a
bit
more
intense
but
gives
a
huge
malt
smell
nonetheless
the
taste
is
solid
and
powerful
spot
on
the
finish
is
sweet
but
has
enough
bitterness
to
keep
it
from
being
cloying
full
in
body
hides
its
alcohol
well

thick
rich

flavor
caramel
molasses
followed
by
a
nice
sting
of
carbonation
finishes
with
a
bitter

tart
fruit
bite
very
nice
an
excellent
double
bock
that
is
priced
very
reasonably
overall
this
is
a
tasty
and
fulfilling
beer
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
redtinted
beer
with
a
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
quickly
has
a
really
enjoyable
maple
syrup
biscuit
and
toffee
aroma
more
breads
and
molasses
in
the
flavor
accompanied
by
some
fruitiness
and
spice
this
is
a
really
smooth
easy
drinker
for
a
doppelbock
could
be
a
session
beer
but
for
the
higher
abv
o
not
what
i
expected
as
far
as
overall
quality
but
still
good
worth
the
bottle
for
sure
overall
this
is
an
excellent
double
bock
full
of
fantastic
sugar
fruit
and
bread
notes
if
cereal
tasted
this
good
i
doubt
id
ever
eat
anything
else
there
is
a
slight
alcohol

in
the
aftertastethe
only
place
i
could
detect
the

in
distracting
strengthbut
otherwise
this
is
a
great
brew
worth
trying
outstanding
and
a
great
value
find
it
buy
it
drink
it
medium
to
slightly
full

with

a
well
done
and
very
satisfying
example
of
the
style
aaaahhh
i
remember
this
beer
so
nostalgicfeeling
drinkin
this
here
brew
still
impressive
after
all
these
years
and
to
think
a
young
me
thought
this
was
too
strong
never
said
it
wasnt
delicious
4

not
my
style
but
well
done
nonetheless
this
is
a
wonderful
dopplebock
i
like
it
a
bit
more
than
great
lakes
dopplerock
but
not
as
much
as
the
classic
celebrator
still
fans
of
the
style
should
definitely
try
to
get
this
o
nice
doppelbock
not
overly
complex
but
has
a
nice
sweetness
and
smooth
feel
overall
drinkability
very
drinkable
especially
when
a
bit
warm
dangerously
drinkable
in
a
way
went
through
one
bottle
quite
fast
and
started
on
another
and
then
it
let
me
know
that
this
malt
bomb
was
at
8
2
heavy
on
the
malt
but
not
in
a
bad
way

up

that
is
not
cloying
at

medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
very
nice
creamy
chewy
and
slightly
slick
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
small
warming
after
the
finish
noticed
quite
smooth
to
drink
but
is
still
a
sipper
overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
doppelbock
nice
flavor
complexity
and
balance
and
very
enjoyable
troegs
troegenator
pours
a
clear
dark
mahogany
with
some
gorgeous
amber
and
cherry
highlights
theres
almost
two
fingers
worth
of
khaki
colored
foam
crowning
the
beer
and
it
displays
pretty
good
head
retention
lacing
is
also
very
nice
the
nose
is
very
heavy
on
cherries
that
dark
fruitiness
is
what
immediately
jumps
out
of
the
glass
its
supported
by
a
firm
note
of
burnt
brown
sugar
the
flavor
develops
a
bit
of
caramel
to
go
along
with
the
cooked
sugar
despite
that
cherries
and
dark
fruit
the
mouthfeel
is
superb
with
a
rich
and
full
body
the
carbonation
tends
towards
the
lower
end
of
the
spectrum
with
just
enough
presence
to
keep
the
beer
from
becoming
syrupy
troegenator
is
a
damn
tasty
beer
but
it
seems
like
its
got
a
lot
of
fruity
flavors
and
not
as
much
of
the
nutty
biscuity
and
more
malty
flavors
that
id
expect
from
a
big
germanstyle
lager
o
mmmmm
a
big
bruiser
of
a
doppelbock
paired
with
steak
and
gorgonzola
cheese
and
worked
incredibly
well
first
time
having
a
troegs
they
got
a
little
bit
adventurous
with
an
already
sweet
style
and
cranked
the
malt
sacrificing
the
hops
and
lager
character
its
not
a
hot
mess
somewhat
complex
but
by
far
the
sweetest
and
heaviest
lager
ive
ever
come
across
more
like
a
wee
heavy
or
plain
old
ale
than
a
bock
borderline
cloying
probably
worth
revisiting
if
you
want
a
meal
of
dessert
in
a
glass
a
lightly
chill
hazed
fluid
as
it
sits
right
now
the
light
brown
head
has
a
decent
size
and
retention
it
is
clear
now
and
there
are
bits
of
lace
starting
to
cling
as
i
sip
this
wonderful
nectar
the
aroma
has
a
sweet
caramel
malt
core
with
a
banana
fruitiness
and
firm
toasted
graininess
there
are
figs
and
dates
as
well
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
taste
is
rich
smooth
and
malty
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
in
the
front
with
a
bouquet
of
dark
fruits
almost
belgian
style
banana
note
as
well
this
is
a
clean
lagered
malt
bomb
however
mocha
and
cocoa
powder
flowing
into
more
pronounced
roasted
coffee
and
grains
hops
are
firmly
bitter
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
that
is
clean
with
just
a
hint
of
mint
and
herbal
leafiness
more
malt
and
bread
flavors
lightly
linger
feel
is
nicely
weighted
with
a
nice
thickness
that
at
the
same
time
is
highly
drinkable
and
supple
a
great
overall
version
of
the
style
and
my
favorite
so
far
this
beer
is
always
welcome
in
my
house
o
this
is
pretty
tasty
but
not
a
style
i
go
crazy
for
and
not
the
best
exemplar
of
the
style
with
those
two
opinions
in
mind
i
dont
think
its
likely
that
ill
have
another
but
it
was
worth
trying
overall
worth
a
try
but
definitely
not
one
of
the
best
brews
troegs
puts
out
its
not
bad
but
troegs
has
plenty
of
better
options
in
its
lineup
troegenator
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
beer
nor
is
it
quite
right
within
the
doppelbock
style
overall
why
a
3
5
overall
when
all
but
mouthfeel
was
in
the
2s
because
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
when
only
focusing
on
drinking
enjoyment
but
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
the
beer
rightfully
for
a
double
bock
leans
toward
malty
sweetness
but
balanced
enough
to
avoid
being
cloying
its
a
drinkable
beer
bannana
aroma
detracted
and
not
typical
of
the
style
not
a
typical
clean
lager
fermentation
maltiness
was
rich
but
lacked
melonodian
depth
that
exemplifies
the
style
being
part
of
a
mixed
12
pack
wont
deter
me
from
purchase
but
im
sure
not
buying
a
straight
sixer
disappointing
considering
the
other
brews
troegs
puts
out
bottom
line
decent
brew
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
icetea
color
with
a
thin
head
and
no
lace
its
aroma
has
a
hint
of
chocolate
at
first
then
caramel
takes
over
the
flavor
is
one
dimensional
purely
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
brandy
in
the
finish
the
flavor
is
sweet
to
the
point
of
being
sickening
like
the
hops
were
forgotten
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
troegs
troegenator
double
bock
is
a
not
a
good
beer
a
poor
representation
of
the
style
not
recommended
this
is
a
great
beer
for
sipping
or
with
food
pours
a
rich
redbrown
color
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
in
my
imperial
punt
glass
the
head
eventually
settles
to
a
ring
around
the
edge
of
my
glass
the
smell
is
of
dark
fruit
a
slight
red
apple
and
some
rich
malt
in
the
taste
i
get
more
of
that
dark
fruit
maybe
a
touch
of
syrup
not
much
of
a
discernible
hop
presence
mouthfeel
is
generally
thick
an
enjoyable
beer
but
not
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
overall
heavy
malts
lots
of
sugar
very
sweet
complex
fruit
smell
and
taste
o
a
very
pleasant
and
flavorful
brew
to
sip
on
the
thick
mouthfeel
makes
it
rather
filling
but
the
abundance
of
dark
fruit
flavors
is
delicious
paired
very
well
with
my
rosemary
flavored
quesadilla
o
very
good
beer
all
the
flavors
balance
well
and
it
is
sweet
but
not
overly
so
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
for
8
2
poured
to
a
mug
the
beer
is
a
deep
rich
brownish
red
amber
color
with
a
cream
colored
hear
about
1
finger
width
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
that
of
biscuits
and
grain
hints
of
chocolate
toffee
and
darker
fruits
no
detectable
alcohol
the
flavor
expands
on
what
was
found
in
the
nose
biscuity
malt
base
from
which
the
fruit
builds
figs
raisins
prunes
caramel
and
chocolate
also
in
the
mix
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
rich
easy
to
drink
mildly
bitter
finishes
smooth
and
rich
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
was
a
treat
good
beer
super
approachable
and
easy
to
put
down
good
stuff
this
beer
pours
smooth
but
has
a
medium
thick
head
that
right
fresh
from
the
bottle
it
is
very
dark
and
an
amber
bock
it
is
not
very
carbonated
consistency
wise
it
is
pretty
light
with
a
spicy
sweet
tangy
taste
right
off
the
bat
followed
by
a
chocolately
taste
after
it
goes
down
after
a
while
it
tones
down
some
with
a
lighter
malt
coming
out
and
is
good
beer
to
have
with
a
nice
meal
o
honestly
this
beer
is
in
my
top
5
as
far
as
my
personal
favorites
go
so
reviewing
it
was
a
breeze
its
a
delicious
beer
and
the
prime
example
of
how
a
double
bock
should
taste
it
has
a
fairly
high
abv
as
far
as
beers
go
but
you
would
never
be
able
to
guess
it
by
drinking
it
alone
and
thats
the
beauty
of
it
id
more
closely
compare
this
to
a
fine
wine
than
a
beer
and
it
should
be
enjoyed
like
the
thing
of
beauty
it
is
overall
i
usually
go
for
hoppy
beers
so
this
was
a
delicious
change
of
pace
if
your
looking
for
a
complex
malty
brew
this
one
is
for
you
this
is
a
nice
dopplebock
i
am
not
a
fan
of
of
them
too
much
but
this
is
tasty
ive
had
this
in
a
bottle
and
thought
it
was
okay
much
better
on
tap
with
a
few
years
of
palate
experience
onot
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
bottle
but
this
was
unlike
many
of
the
other
doppelbocks
ive
had
thin
with
a
boring
malt
presence
another
excellent
beer
from
tröegs
this
chestnut
brown
double
bock
has
a
nice
head
and
some
lacing
pleasant
malty
aroma
with
some
noticeable
alcohol
in
the
nose
plenty
of
flavor
here
the
malt
hops
and
roasted
flavor
combine
with
spice
and
fruit
and
a
slight
bitterness
balances
the
sweetness
wonderfully
a
thoroughly
satisfying
brew
that
stands
up
really
well
to
the
german
greats
pretty
good
brew
i
havent
waded
far
into
the
dopplebock
pool
yet
but
id
imagine
that
this
is
a
fair
representation
overall
big
malt
and
sugary
sweet
smoothness
the
best
way
to
describe
this
brew
its
easy
to
drink
even
with
its
potent
strength
o
great
dopplebock
with
a
variety
of
sweet
malty
flavors
very
sweet
but
not
overpowering
smooth
with
well
hidden
alcohol
i
will
get
this
again
thanks
to
drewshal9
for
this
one
o
i
like
it
i
love
bocks
sometimes
when
you
get
high
alcohol
it
detracts
not
here
easily
drinkable
not
by
favorite
style
but
im
branching
out
i
like
it
though
well
rounded
beer
overall
you
wont
be
drinking
this
beer
i
tend
ot
think
you
will
be
inhaling
it
so
smooth
you
crave
it
for
dessert
no
it
not
that
sweet
but
it
is
that
appetizing
salud
drinkability
and
overall
impression
im
enjoying
this
one
and
its
good
enough
that
im
drinking
it
faster
than
i
like
but
its
also
not
quite
as
challenging
as
some
of
the
other
dopplebocks
ive
had
that
said
its
a
tasty
drinkable
beer
which
ive
had
more
than
once
and
will
continue
to
have
when
the
mood
strikes
o
not
at
all
my
style
of
beer
and
i
have
little
to
compare
this
to
in
the
same
genre
but
i
like
it
its
a
nice
one
and
done
beer
i
am
happy
to
try
this
this
is
as
close
to
sessionable
that
a
doppelbock
can
get
i
dont
think
its
quite
a
classic
but
i
do
think
its
quite
good
i
definitely
approve
of
this
but
it
packs
quite
a
kick
obviously
so
i
will
continue
to
take
it
slow
overall
this
is
not
my
fancy
at
all
and
is
insanely
difficult
to
drink
to
the
point
that
i
actually
dumped
mine
wellbalanced
for
the
8
abv
like
it
more
than
this
years
mad
elf
overall
highly
drinkable
though
higher
in
wellhidden
alcohol
o
overall
a
nice
smooth
drinker
well
i
guess
this
really
fits
the
definition
of
a
double
bock
beer
its
just
not
what
i
had
expected
after
trying
ayingers
masterful
celebrator
still
good
though
overall
not
really
my
thing
ive
had
a
few
of
troegs
better
offers
nugget
hopback
so
i
was
pretty
disappointed
with
the
doublebock
it
was
my
third
try
at
it
from
this
sixer
too
so
i
gave
it
a
fair
shot
alcohol
is
not
apparent
in
the
taste
but
is
felt
at
the
end
a
sipping
beer
for
me
not
one
to
pound
several
but
that
isnt
what
a
dopplebock
is
about
i
think
my
favorite
is
still
celebrator
but
this
is
definitely
up
there
on
my
list
of
top
doppelbocks
worth
drinking
again
and
again
and
again
o
seems
like
a
good
americanized
version
if
this
style
of
beer
definitely
doesnt
seem
to
be
strictly
to
style
but
adds
a
nice
balance
this
is
a
good
one
if
the
color
was
a
leather
you
would
call
it
oxblood
lovely
but
quickly
dissipating
sepia
head
lacing
is
light
but
consistent
and
appetizing
smells
like
so
many
good
things
im
gonna
go
with
banana
bread
with
a
smear
of
nutella
the
taste
is
a
similar
miasma
grain
notes
dancing
with
that
banana
ester
going
on
some
faint
spicy
hops
and
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
on
the
back
it
is
8
2
after
all
mouthfeel
isnt
syrupy
as
you
would
think
and
makes
this
fairly
heavy
beer
extremely
drinkable
this
is
a
beautiful
allseason
beer
highly
recommended
overall
a
very
good
dopplebock
good
representation
of
the
style
i
love
the
sweet
flavors
in
combination
with
the
roasted
malt
very
good
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pokal
the
beer
is
a
vibrant
clear
dark
rubyblood
red
coloring
with
a
nice
light
inch
and
a
half
biege
colored
head
the
head
quickly
settles
into
an
eighth
of
an
inch
rich
aromas
with
a
strong
old
world
fruit
presence
of
date
raisin
and
fig
with
a
malty
backbone
flavors
are
dark
and
sweet
with
the
raisin
fig
and
date
present
again
as
well
as
a
light
roasting
and
toasty
feel
and
a
slight
boozey
highlight
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
cloying
with
an
oily
slick
finish
strong
flavors
and
a
tasty
brew
another
great
brew
from
troegs
the
alcohol
is
disguised
well
this
is
a
great
winter
beer
it
wars
you
up
nicely
this
was
my
old
roommates
favorite
brew
i
should
thank
him
for
introducing
me
to
this
delicious
beer
overall
a
good
american
recreation
of
the
dopplebock
this
one
is
very
well
balanced
but
does
suffer
a
bit
from
being
onenote
it
is
good
but
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
likes
of
ayingers
overall
just
a
great
example
of
this
style
definitely
a
little
biased
as
this
one
my
first
real
craft
brews
i
tasted
but
this
is
good
representation
of
the
doppelbock
malty
clean
flavors
pours
a
clear
ruby
copper
color
with
less
than
a
quarter
inch
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
skim
cover
and
a
spotty
wispy
lace
mild
smell
of
dark
fruits
sugary
with
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
very
good
its
complex
and
very
sweet
up
front
with
fig
dried
plums
raisin
caramel
and
toffee
slightly
spicy
warm
finish
mouthfeel
lacks
carbonation
tends
to
flatten
out
overall
not
bad
taste
really
saves
this
beer
o
i
like
malty
beers
and
bocks
but
this
is
only
the
second
doppelbock
ive
ever
tried
good
but
not
as
good
as
thomas
hookers
liberator
imo
d
this
is
a
delicious
doppelbock
lots
of
really
good
malts
flavors
blend
together
to
form
a
really
solid
example
of
this
style
from
this
side
of
the
atlantic
poured
a
nice
almost
mahogany
color
not
much
head
wise
the
taste
almost
reminds
me
a
of
a
trailmix
snack
barminus
the
sweetness
i
got
heavy
notes
of
fruity
goodness
in
the
smell
finishes
a
tad
dryonly
wanting
another
swallow
to
test
that
dryness
again
tasty
brew
overall
overall
this
is
a
staple
for
the
style
i
use
this
beer
as
a
gateway
for
my
non
craft
drinking
friends
and
they
all
love
it
another
knockout
from
troegs
i
could
taste
too
much
alcohol
nice
hints
of
raisin
you
get
a
sweet
raisin
taste
up
front
followed
by
a
malty
bread
flavor
then
it
ends
with
a
slight
hop
bitter
the
alcohol
flavor
overpowered
everything
else
i
am
not
a
huge
bick
fan
this
beer
is
true
to
the
style
if
you
are
a
big
bock
fan
give
it
a
try
its
just
not
the
beer
for
me
worth
trying
once
but
i
was
a
little
underwhelmed
by
this
one
felt
like
the
sweet
malt
was
a
little
too
dominant
even
for
the
style
abv
was
pretty
wellconcealed
drink
i
love
her
to
death
for
putting
up
with
my
beer
habit
i
thank
her
very
much
for
finding
this
on
a
shelf
but
its
my
fault
for
not
teaching
her
to
look
for
bottle
dates
this
one
is
on
me
i
wanted
to
be
blown
away
like
i
was
with
thomas
hooker
and
ayinger
but
sadly
wasnt
ill
try
this
one
again
someday
fresher
honestly
surprisingly
awesome
quite
the
well
balanced
beer
with
lots
of
surprises
a
beer
drinker
could
want
dangerously
drinkable
o
another
solid
effort
by
troegs
very
drinkable
for
a
relatively
heavy
beerstyle
no
sign
of
the
8
2
at
all
floglida
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
lagersi
usually
get
a
sixer
about
once
a
month
very
good
lager
notes
easy
as
it
is
and
considering
that
im
not
too
crazy
about
doppelbocks
it
works
pretty
well
not
something
that
i
would
ever
actively
seek
out
but
worth
the
experience
o
decent
beer
but
came
across
as
a
bit
too
boozy
with
a
sticky
sweetness
overall
i
think
i
expected
more
with
this
beer
it
was
good
but
no
where
near
one
of
the
better
dopplebocks
ive
had
happy
that
i
gave
it
a
try
but
id
buy
something
else
next
time
this
was
my
first
attempt
at
cellaring
a
lager
style
the
main
noticeable
difference
from
its
fresh
counterpart
seemed
to
be
the
elevated
sweetness
while
the
original
pungent
qualities
seemed
to
combine
into
one
smooth
continuous
palate
with
the
familiar
dark
fruits
and
sweetness
hitting
at
the
end
delicious
for
a
beer
with
a
high
abv
od
for
a
beer
that
fits
my
style
i
couldnt
rank
this
up
there
with
the
better
ones
ive
had
it
has
way
too
much
residual
sugar
sweetness
causing
roughness
probably
wouldnt
reach
for
this
again
d
strong
sweetmalty
character
probably
limits
the
number
you
would
want
to
throw
back
in
one
sitting
overall
not
very
complex
but
a
tasty
beverage
overall
grade
a
overall
i
give
it
a
4
5
o
easily
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
ive
had
and
one
id
happily
drink
again
and
thats
saying
something
since
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
the
style
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
with
a
pinkie
size
white
head
almost
no
lacing
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
head
diminished
quickly
and
it
looks
like
this
beer
is
free
of
carbonation
smells
of
raisins
sweet
malts
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
as
im
typing
this
my
dog
dropped
a
wicked
fart
must
be
the
offbrand
treats
we
got
him
but
i
knew
this
wasnt
part
of
the
beer
but
nonetheless
through
me
for
a
loop
and
was
a
god
awful
smell
taste
is
very
sweet
i
catch
notes
of
dark
fruits
mainly
plums
and
raisins
the
carbonation
is
light
and
the
mouthful
is
thin
not
a
very
crisp
finish
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
hint
all
3s
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
received
this
as
an
extra
and
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
will
not
be
disappointed
if
i
never
drink
it
again
o
awesome
doppelbock
a
nice
sipping
beer
8
25
alcohol
by
volume
im
liking
this
brewery
more
and
more
ogood
example
of
the
style
and
a
very
tasty
beer
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
troegs
beer
but
thus
far
i
have
not
been
disappointed
overall
impression
a
big
malty
immensely
drinkable
dopplebock
worthy
to
sip
and
savor
a
good
beer
overall
but
a
little
sweeter
than
i
like
in
a
doppelbock
o
solid
beer
great
experience
definitely
will
go
back
to
this
cheers
do
first
and
foremost
what
really
makes
troegenator
is
the
nicely
hidden
abv
for
being
8
2
i
dont
believe
it
shows
which
greatly
enhances
drinkability
troegs
nails
it
again
and
while
not
the
best
dopplebock
troegenator
certainly
holds
its
own
o
meh
mediocre
doppel
to
me
i
would
like
the
beer
to
be
a
hare
turbid
produce
some
head
more
complex
and
layered
flavor
profile
a
better
feel
and
long
finish
overall
a
very
good
if
slightly
sweet
interpretation
of
the
doppelbock
style
would
certainly
go
back
to
again
if
given
the
chance
i
liked
this
beer
i
may
pick
up
more
for
oktoberfest
overall
id
recommend
trying
this
one
out
its
a
safe
choice
but
also
has
some
features
that
should
keep
you
interested
the
beer
pours
a
burgundy
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
quickly
faded
it
smells
mostly
of
toasted
caramel
malt
with
a
sugar
cookie
background
and
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
very
smooth
with
flavors
of
buttered
toast
with
some
bread
and
chocolate
the
beer
is
very
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
bready
finish
this
is
an
excellent
double
bock
the
abv
is
well
hidden
and
its
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
finish
is
mellow
bitter
but
mild
o
all
around
a
pretty
good
brew
normally
im
not
a
doublebock
kinda
guy
but
this
one
hit
the
spot
o
im
surprised
at
my
rating
this
used
to
be
a
beer
i
was
very
enthusiastic
about
a
great
american
staple
of
the
style
overall
it
a
nice
dopplebock
i
would
like
a
bit
more
balance
in
this
beer
to
tame
the
massive
amount
of
malty
sweetness
but
thats
what
a
dopplebock
is
all
about
the
malt
overall
i
was
pretty
dissappointed
with
this
brew
overall
a
very
solid
dark
beer
the
first
dobblebock
ive
tried
o
very
nice
offering
form
troegs
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
o
i
like
this
theres
a
lot
of
spice
character
to
the
nose
and
flavor
that
really
fits
the
body
very
well
well
rounded
and
a
nice
handling
of
a
style
that
can
be
a
bit
monotone
with
its
dark
fruit
notes
this
is
definitely
dark
fruit
jams
and
not
a
two
tone
datefig
bomb
the
cardamom
spice
flavor
gains
complexity
as
it
falls
into
a
mellow
woody
flavor
an
earthy
dark
fruit
spread
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
on
rustic
bread
the
mouth
feel
and
taste
make
this
a
likeable
offering
o
i
only
have
the
faintest
memory
of
the
one
or
two
doppelbocks
ive
had
in
the
past
so
i
cant
offer
much
instyle
comparison
or
judgment
here
but
i
can
tell
you
that
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
packed
with
so
much
flavor
its
just
as
much
a
snack
as
it
is
a
beer
refreshing
intense
good
definitely
worth
giving
this
a
shot
d
i
wish
this
was
a
brewery
that
was
more
readily
available
in
my
area
this
was
a
very
solid
brew
and
in
my
opinion
a
good
variation
of
the
style
definitely
worth
a
try
good
mouthfeel
flavors
last
fairly
long
thru
the
finish
very
drinkable
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
hazy
chestnut
brown
with
a
small
creamy
white
head
aroma
was
pretty
weak
but
roasty
malts
abound
for
the
most
part
toasted
bread
and
malts
in
the
taste
dry
and
grainy
with
hints
of
raisin
and
apple
skin
pretty
strong
alcohol
sensation
medium
mouthfeel
and
fairly
drinkable
but
only
if
its
my
only
option
notes
from
june
23
2010
d
4
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
brew
it
has
a
fairly
strong
aromataste
combination
that
would
be
quite
satisfying
when
in
the
mood
i
feel
it
would
be
better
enjoyed
in
the
colder
months
like
a
winter
ale
would
be
june
at
time
of
review
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
at
that
time
but
probably
no
more
than
one
or
two
right
now
it
is
bold
but
it
is
solid
pours
dark
amber
with
a
thin
tan
head
i
only
really
got
malt
in
the
nose
sweet
flavor
that
has
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
as
is
to
be
expected
in
the
bock
not
as
heavy
as
some
bocks
ive
had
has
a
grat
mouthfeel
and
finishes
well
this
is
the
beer
i
expect
from
troges
o
i
will
say
that
i
quite
enjoyed
the
troegenator
double
bock
was
it
the
best
of
the
style
ive
had
not
exactly
as
it
didnt
pack
the
same
hearty
character
of
german
dopplebocks
however
it
was
a
great
value
for
a
more
full
flavored
beer
at
8
99
a
six
pack
and
served
as
a
great
stand
in
when
i
was
quite
feeling
a
stout
overall
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
want
to
seek
out
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
one
of
the
best
in
my
opinion
i
have
ever
had
since
i
normally
favor
milk
stout
i
was
surprised
how
much
i
really
liked
this
beer
but
i
really
do
just
love
dark
beer
in
general
and
this
one
is
awesome
i
had
this
at
the
spotty
dog
in
hudson
ny
and
also
took
a
growler
full
to
a
zombie
walk
in
albnay
later
that
day
this
beer
was
great
straight
form
the
tap
slightly
chilled
in
a
pint
and
also
fresh
from
the
growler
out
of
a
red
plastic
party
cup
this
is
a
deep
dark
maltyroasted
slightly
sweet
brew
with
a
very
distinct
flavor
pleasing
and
thick
i
may
try
from
a
bottle
but
tend
to
find
beer
usually
tastes
best
from
the
keg
amberred
in
colour
pale
taupe
head
is
develops
well
but
falls
short
in
retention
and
lacing
nut
and
dried
fruit
aromatics
bready
a
winelike
quality
even
a
hint
of
milk
chocolate
rich
and
malty
in
a
way
that
makes
allusions
to
liquid
bread
appropriate
deeply
concentrated
raisin
flavour
honey
finishes
with
an
extremely
light
bitterness
alcohol
nearly
imperceptible
mediumbodied
and
lightly
carbonated
with
a
sticky
sugary
mouthfeel
i
have
no
idea
what
this
beer
is
like
fresh
i
bought
this
bottle
back
in
2008
the
same
year
i
visited
the
ny
state
fair
and
it
has
languished
at
the
back
of
the
beer
closet
since
with
that
said
this
tastes
really
good
now
its
not
complex
but
there
is
a
great
deal
of
depth
and
concentration
in
this
with
no
real
off
flavours
this
was
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
and
im
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
pulling
it
out
tonight
this
has
been
on
my
to
drink
list
for
a
whilefinally
after
paying
all
my
unpaid
parking
tickets
i
bought
some
now
after
chilling
it
some
im
enjoying
this
fine
malted
beverage
its
no
doubt
a
good
example
of
a
dopplebock
it
is
low
in
carbination
nor
much
of
a
head
on
this
smells
kinda
fruitywith
some
hints
of
bread
there
taste
has
a
hint
of
fruitdark
liquoriceand
a
malty
aftertaste
to
enjoy
o
its
interesting
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
these
and
the
flavors
seemed
to
get
a
little
dull
after
the
first
its
my
first
foray
into
doppelbocks
and
i
dont
have
a
ton
of
experience
with
bocks
so
ill
give
more
of
these
a
taste
and
see
how
this
one
compares
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
well
balanced
and
refreshing
hard
to
think
that
i
would
want
to
drink
a
beer
this
dark
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
do
a
very
sweet
doublebock
very
drinkable
and
the
alcohol
very
well
hidden
i
am
glad
that
i
bought
this
beer
to
try
it
and
add
it
to
my
beer
advocate
collection
anyway
mouthfeel
is
full
and
chewy
but
still
on
the
lighter
side
once
again
from
the
lager
yeast
it
just
strips
the
fullfruity
delicious
maltiness
from
everything
it
touches
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
still
a
very
good
tasting
beer
and
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
ive
ever
had
but
will
never
have
the
complexity
and
flavor
potential
of
a
comparable
ale
with
a
similar
malt
bill
drinkability
would
have
liked
it
more
stout
like
celebrator
but
a
good
dopplebock
this
was
probably
one
of
the
first
doppelbocks
id
ever
had
i
didnt
know
too
much
about
them
or
what
they
were
what
i
quickly
founf
out
though
was
how
great
this
one
tasted
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
nice
from
start
to
finish
the
pour
was
a
deep
mohagany
brown
color
with
a
nice
looking
tan
head
the
retention
was
pretty
good
through
out
the
smell
is
sweet
with
dark
malts
and
some
fruits
in
there
along
with
a
touch
of
hops
the
flavors
of
the
beer
are
pretty
intense
the
first
thing
you
get
is
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
perhaps
some
brown
sugar
the
second
thing
i
get
are
the
roasted
malts
with
some
hops
tingling
my
tongue
the
aftetaste
is
try
with
some
subtle
sweet
flavors
still
lurking
in
there
the
mouthfeel
is
very
drinkable
i
think
it
makes
this
brew
a
little
dangerous
because
of
its
high
abv
however
its
a
really
nice
brew
one
of
the
best
from
tröegs
without
a
doubt
o
a
nice
easy
to
enjoy
beer
and
the
8
2
abv
is
not
noticeable
at
all
definitely
worth
the
money
overall
again
probably
would
have
enjoyed
this
one
better
if
it
wasnt
so
hot
outside
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
doppelbocks
to
begin
with
but
this
one
was
enjoyable
although
i
have
had
better
taste
is
very
much
like
the
aroma
this
is
a
good
doppelbock
very
breadyyeasty
with
rich
fruits
overripe
red
apples
and
caramel
and
some
pine
rich
and
complex
sweet
malt
flavors
swirling
around
in
there
well
done
o
yum
4
d
very
drinkable
for
8
2
not
as
thick
and
meaty
as
id
prefer
but
a
delicious
kind
of
yeastfruity
treat
o
a
very
solid
example
of
the
style
one
that
i
will
purchase
again
o
some
people
might
not
light
the
extreme
sweetness
of
this
beer
but
i
love
it
i
could
not
stop
swooning
over
this
beer
almost
reminds
me
of
a
mad
elf
i
want
more
pours
a
dark
burgundy
minimal
head
and
lace
nose
of
dark
fruits
and
some
vinous
qualities
loads
of
malt
with
a
subtler
sweetness
overshadowed
by
bigger
dryer
dark
breadiness
some
caramel
notes
also
taste
has
more
dark
fruits
dry
dark
breadienss
good
mouthfeel
smooth
full
and
relatively
dry
finish
alcohol
doesnt
come
through
substantially
but
can
be
sensed
this
warms
the
bones
nicely
and
is
a
nice
dopplebock
o
a
good
brew
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
i
would
imagine
due
to
the
sweetness
makes
it
relatively
heavy
even
though
the
body
is
medium
excellent
doppelbock
one
of
the
best
in
the
states
a
very
bold
fruity
component
no
doubt
from
the
amount
of
munich
malt
fantastic
d
a
strong
malty
showing
alcohol
isnt
as
detectable
as
i
expected
overall
has
the
strength
of
a
big
sweet
chewy
ale
but
the
smoothness
of
a
lager
a
well
made
beer
the
body
is
thin
and
the
carbonation
is
mild
overall
another
doppelbock
and
another
satisfied
customer
this
style
is
becoming
a
new
favorite
style
for
me
i
would
definitely
drink
another
of
these
if
i
had
a
chance
a
darn
good
doppelbock
though
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
fruity
and
sugary
which
i
like
but
i
recognize
others
might
not
my
advice
pour
slowly
and
youll
enjoy
it
much
more
overall
a
pretty
weak
doppelbock
then
again
i
havent
had
any
doppelbocks
brewed
in
america
that
can
compare
to
what
is
brewed
in
germany
we
must
find
their
secret
overall
it
was
ok
the
alcohol
wasnt
disguised
at
points
in
the
taste
and
the
impression
that
lasted
the
longest
was
grapefruit
this
isnt
my
favorite
doppelback
but
it
was
a
solid
beer
none
the
less
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
it
is
definitely
not
a
session
beer
as
the
sweet
malts
become
too
overpowering
on
the
palate
for
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
i
miss
having
ready
access
to
this
stuff
whenever
the
mood
struck
me
to
grab
some
oh
well
thats
what
tradings
for
right
it
pours
a
clear
dark
garnetrusset
topped
by
a
relatively
shortlived
finger
of
dirty
sandstone
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
figs
red
grapes
toffee
butter
light
cinnamon
and
light
rye
bread
the
taste
seems
to
want
to
follow
this
directive
but
a
sharp
nip
of
orange
peel
and
astringent
though
kinda
light
coffee
detract
somewhat
from
the
otherwise
pleasant
flavors
its
not
enough
to
completely
torpedo
the
proceedings
but
enough
to
be
negatively
noticeable
the
body
is
a
lightish
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
lightly
grainy
feel
overall
though
a
teensy
bit
thin
and
that
touch
bitterly
unpleasant
on
the
tongue
this
is
still
a
very
solid
dbock
generally
good
times
verdict
im
not
a
fan
but
its
balanced
well
enough
that
it
will
appeal
to
many
people
o
i
can
handle
one
per
setting
thats
about
it
not
one
that
i
enjoy
for
more
though
a
nice
experience
for
just
the
one
maybe
good
with
whatever
would
go
well
with
a
darker
red
wine
overalla
wellmade
clean
dopplebock
everything
you
look
for
complex
aromas
and
flavors
alcohol
legs
warming
needs
more
complexity
in
the
flavor
to
truly
be
world
class
but
will
definitely
warm
you
up
on
a
cold
night
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
troegs
the
troegenator
holds
its
status
as
one
of
my
goto
doppelbocks
because
of
its
availability
and
the
fact
that
i
can
get
it
in
6packs
all
things
considered
its
a
pretty
good
doppelbock
good
solid
beer
great
name
o
very
solid
dopplebock
an
another
good
one
from
troegs
o
this
one
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
nicely
balanced
had
it
later
with
red
velvet
and
it
was
a
perfect
combo
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
really
nicely
balanced
there
is
a
nice
amount
of
dark
fruit
flavor
but
it
blends
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
really
well
pours
a
dark
copper
with
a
small
offwhite
head
smell
is
caramel
taste
is
sweet
throughout
caramel
a
litter
herbal
hops
butter
toffee
very
well
balanced
rounded
taste
full
bodied
very
easily
drinkable
overall
a
very
balanced
and
taste
beer
really
great
for
an
american
doppelbock
o
not
the
best
doppelbock
ive
had
tonight
but
not
a
bad
one
by
any
means
some
deeper
character
and
a
bigger
malt
presence
would
help
3
55
o
ive
yet
to
meet
a
troegs
offering
that
i
didnt
like
this
dopplebock
despite
the
relatively
high
abv
is
pretty
drinkable
d
this
one
definitely
grew
on
me
from
start
to
finish
but
still
wouldnt
warrant
purchasing
another
one
at
the
end
not
nearly
as
drinkable
as
some
of
the
other
troegs
products
like
nugget
nectar
o
worth
trying
but
not
my
preference
for
the
style
cheers
d
a
nice
brew
not
overly
sweet
and
not
too
boozy
another
good
offering
by
troegs
drinkable
yep
very
a
dark
copper
with
ruby
edges
flows
out
of
the
bottled
adorned
with
an
interesting
looking
character
set
off
with
bushy
white
hair
and
a
nasty
set
of
horns
i
assume
he
is
the
troegenator
smells
like
bread
and
spice
not
a
lot
of
hops
here
but
i
do
get
some
sweet
toasty
bread
some
spice
in
the
finish
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
not
really
bitter
and
the
8
2
abv
is
sneaky
its
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
goes
down
pretty
easy
its
really
drinkable
but
maybe
not
at
first
i
came
around
to
this
beer
quiet
quickly
fuller
bodied
than
expected
with
lots
of
sweet
malt
subtle
chocolate
and
spice
lots
of
clove
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
balanced
out
by
hints
of
sweet
caramel
malt
chocolate
toffee
and
hazelnut
slightly
toasted
with
some
rye
toffee
and
biscuit
flavor
spicy
up
front
quickly
balanced
by
the
full
malt
body
silky
and
flavorful
with
a
well
masked
abv
making
it
dangerously
drinkable
pours
reddish
copper
with
a
big
tan
head
that
recedes
leaving
some
residual
head
behind
smells
of
caramel
malts
and
has
a
breadiness
about
it
from
the
yeast
reminds
me
of
another
beer
i
cant
quite
place
yet
contains
a
hop
bitterness
and
spiciness
which
is
welcome
along
the
warming
alcohol
flavorsensation
big
body
here
which
is
helped
out
with
a
nice
dose
of
carbonation
big
alcohol
helps
keep
a
slow
and
steady
pace
even
though
its
not
a
weak
beer
i
could
easily
have
a
few
in
a
sitting
this
goes
well
with
tonights
nfl
network
top
10
marathon
and
light
snow
thats
falling
right
now
and
even
though
its
not
on
the
level
of
troegs
most
popular
beers
this
is
wellcrafted
and
the
sweetness
hides
the
more
potent
aspects
of
this
certainly
worthy
of
the
horned
illustration
on
the
bottle
d
sweet
malty
smooth
brew
easy
to
drink
took
me
a
bit
to
get
used
to
but
very
enjoyable
after
a
few
sips
d
i
could
probably
knock
down
a
couple
of
these
but
the
high
alcohol
and
sweetness
would
likely
come
in
my
way
d
extremely
drinkable
for
the
style
this
is
by
far
the
easiestdrinking
not
to
mention
best
doppelbock
ive
had
i
cannot
believe
this
is
an
8
20
abv
beer
considering
the
light
body
and
complete
masking
of
the
alcohol
in
flavor
and
scent
ive
had
it
before
and
ill
have
it
again
highly
recommended
if
you
have
a
chance
to
pick
it
up
or
trade
for
it
d
perhaps
too
sweet
to
drink
several
of
them
i
wasnt
left
wanting
another
right
away
but
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
down
the
road
d
i
believe
this
one
has
aged
nicely
the
alcohol
is
completely
gone
and
has
a
really
nice
malt
presence
definitely
worth
cellaring
for
a
few
years
pours
a
dark
crimson
almost
looks
like
blood
head
is
weak
and
so
is
carbonation
the
color
though
very
nice
smells
sweet
sugary
with
a
fruity
smell
of
raisins
dates
apricots
and
prunes
overpower
the
malty
goodiness
of
this
beer
on
top
of
everything
alcohol
is
hot
and
not
hidden
well
tastes
like
it
smells
only
the
mouthfeel
is
killed
with
a
hot
alcohol
finish
that
burns
the
mouth
on
down
the
hatch
not
smooth
which
also
doesnt
make
it
extremely
drinkable
since
after
2
youre
either
overlyintoxicated
or
just
cant
stand
another
sip
of
this
overlysweet
bock
troegs
i
still
love
you
though
im
going
to
save
a
pair
of
these
until
next
year
and
see
if
some
time
smooths
out
the
flavor
the
tröegenator
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
flavorwise
really
weak
head
less
than
a
finger
but
with
a
nice
deep
earthy
malt
aroma
poured
a
nice
deep
reddishbronze
in
the
glass
fullbodied
dry
sweetness
with
some
bready
flavor
and
a
savory
finish
the
finish
also
had
some
unpleasant
lingering
butterydiacetyl
things
going
on
that
severely
cut
down
on
the
drinkability
for
me
ive
had
much
more
balanced
doppelbocks
for
sure
and
better
offerings
from
tröegs
d
dark
yet
light
body
with
lots
of
flavor
make
this
beer
pretty
drinkable
1306
this
22oz
bottle
is
another
good
winter
beer
not
repulsive
at
all
even
with
double
the
alcohol
of
most
other
beers
a
good
treat
will
definitely
grab
again
d
actually
easy
to
drink
despite
the
high
abv
fairly
refreshing
the
soft
plush
mouthfeel
stands
out
more
than
any
actual
flavor
taste
is
mostly
blah
munich
toasted
sweet
with
a
chocolate
malt
whimper
in
back
little
hop
spice
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
dimpled
mug
pours
a
dark
clear
reddish
color
with
a
smallish
creamy
beige
head
smell
is
lightly
smoky
and
sweet
musty

tastes
lightly
smoky
and
a
touch
tart
with
toasty
biscuity
and
caramel
maltiness
slight
taste
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
full
body
and
soft
to
medium
carbonation
one
of
my
favorite
doppelbocks
great
beer
good
depth
of
flavor
strong
malt
taste
and
pretty
good
drinkability
i
had
it
a
little
cold
at
the
start
but
when
it
warmed
up
i
had
a
large
bottle
so
on
the
second
pour
it
was
closer
to
ideal
the
spicy
notes
came
to
life
the
color
of
the
beer
was
very
appealing
as
well
i
will
say
i
think
i
enjoyed
the
beer
more
because
notre
dame
won
while
i
was
drinking
it
ha
ha
d
easy
drinking
deceptive
for
its
abv
id
recommend
this
as
a
great
american
doppleback
id
have
again
great
example
of
a
doppelbock
and
one
of
the
best
that
ive
had
has
a
nice
smell
of
malts
nuts
and
molasses
has
a
great
taste
a
little
hoppy
for
me
but
nice
taste
and
medium
mouthfeel
drinkibility
is
not
that
great
at
least
for
me
bc
of
hoppiness
d
goes
down
smooth
a
lot
smoother
than
youd
expect
from
an
abv
of
8
2
lookin
forward
toafew
more
of
these
while
watching
the
jets
beat
the
patriots
this
afternoon
cheers
this
was
an
impulse
buy
at
the
local
pizza
shop
ive
had
troeggs
hopback
and
love
it
so
i
thought
what
the
hell
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
can
kick
your
ass
before
you
know
it
pours
with
a
head
that
goes
quickly
but
the
hint
of
carbonation
stays
with
it
very
malty
with
a
distinct
alcohol
aftertaste
not
found
in
most
beers
ive
had
great
color
not
a
fan
of
most
bocks
but
id
buy
this
again
this
is
the
first
troegs
beer
that
ive
tried
but
i
want
more
d
troegenator
is
a
delicious
brew
the
flavors
are
so
unique
and
you
can
really
drink
a
ton
of
these
until
you
realize
its
8
2
great
job
troegs
smooth
and
somewhat
creamy
the
juicy
dry
finish
makes
me
keep
sipping
drinkable
yes
its
not
boozy
like
other
doubles
the
8
3
abv
hides
well
but
will
sneak
up
later
d
highly
drinkable
easily
can
have
more
than
onethe
8
2
abv
was
somewhat
of
a
surprise
alcohol
hidden
very
well
a
very
enjoyable
beer
very
balanced
in
taste
with
the
malts
and
sugars
bananas
on
the
finish
with
chewyness
and
guess
what
hops
imagine
that
this
is
a
great
tasting
brew
and
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
again
for
a
doppelbock
overall
this
was
a
nice
doppelbock
with
some
hints
of
cherry
very
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
a
very
nice
sippingslow
drinker
flavors
and
feels
change
as
beer
warms
d
great
beer
this
has
quickly
become
a
go
to
beer
for
me
and
i
tend
to
have
some
on
hand
has
become
a
crowd
pleaser
with
my
friends
d
pretty
high
for
an
8
2
hardly
a
hint
of
any
alcohol
d
a
nicely
crafted
doppelbock
to
chase
the
chill
away
the
8
2
abv
warms
while
the
robust
malt
body
gives
you
something
to
chew
on
almost
literally
good
amount
of
fruity
and
herbal
hop
spiciness
but
very
malt
forward
character
is
delivered
here
more
flavors
jump
out
at
you
as
the
brew
warms
up
a
bit
which
is
recommended
given
its
heft
d
at
8
2
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
lager
its
easy
to
see
why
this
is
a
popular
brew
its
a
very
satisfying
beverage
overall
overall
the
beer
was
a
complex
fruity
doppelbock
with
hints
of
bitterness
i
havent
drank
many
of
this
style
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
recommend
other
beer
drinkers
to
try
it
cheers
papa
this
beer
drinks
very
easily
i
would
to
see
this
on
tap
somewhere
so
i
could
enjoy
more
than
the
11
ounces
i
have
here
22oz
bottle
i
bought
it
to
try
with
a
duck
pours
a
dark
red
with
no
head
and
champaign
like
carbonation
i
had
to
switch
a
glass
to
a
flute
aroma
is
of
cherry
caramel
malt
with
slight
hoppy
notes
full
sparkling
body
flavor
starts
off
sweet
caramel
malt
dark
fruit
and
molasses
with
some
alcohol
and
earthy
notes
at
the
end
quite
tasty
heavy
brew
d
nice
flavour
but
too
sweet
for
me
overall
a
great
beer
festive
and
bold
feels
like
it
really
captures
the
spirit
of
ator
type
beers
as
a
winter
holdover
d
very
drinkable
for
the
style
the
sweetness
isnt
overpowering
and
the
hop
blance
keeps
it
fresh
on
your
palate
d
just
the
right
sweetness
for
doppelbock
good
beer
overall
i
would
recommend
it
this
is
a
surprisingly
easy
drink
for
its
abv
very
rich
in
flavor
but
not
overpowering
i
need
to
check
out
more
of
this
style
pours
a
dark
red
bordering
on
mahogany
a
very
clear
beer
light
tan
head
fades
fairly
quickly
aroma
is
muted
but
some
toasted
grain
aroma
comes
through
the
flavor
is
pretty
big
and
is
dominated
by
toasted
grains
some
caramel
and
alcohol
the
alcohol
presence
is
pretty
big
for
a
beer
of
8
2
abv
mouthfeel
is
good
for
the
style
but
drinkability
suffers
from
the
noticeable
alcohol
flavor
i
love
doppelbocks
and
love
six
packs
and
troegenator
is
one
of
the
few
american
options
as
far
as
this
style
is
concerned
it
is
however
still
not
up
to
par
with
the
german
brews
of
this
style
overall
a
good
double
bock
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
saw
it
at
the
super
market
and
it
picked
my
curiosity
since
it
was
a
brand
i
never
saw
before
flavor
and
colour
was
good
with
an
enjoyable
aftertaste
tasted
the
same
throughout
the
bottle
a
bit
strong
at
8
2
alchohol
content
d
its
a
brew
to
sip
with
its
strong
aggressive
body
and
rich
sweetness
the
flavor
is
a
sad
departure
from
the
deep
nose
offering
a
rather
bland
malty
sweetness
good
dopple
otherwise
d
easy
drinker
probably
on
the
sweeter
side
for
some
for
me
its
alright
not
doing
anything
special
for
me
really
maybe
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
really
its
a
huge
malt
bomb
that
is
actually
hard
to
drink
towards
the
end
from
the
sweetness
this
beer
is
dominated
by
a
really
nice
malty
sweetness
that
completely
disguises
the
8
abv
color
is
a
dark
reddish
brown
not
a
huge
kickup
of
head
and
not
a
ton
of
retention
but
the
carbonation
is
restrained
well
making
this
a
very
drinkable
brew
this
malty
mammoth
is
a
keeper
overall
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
challenge
when
it
came
to
identifying
all
of
the
flavors
what
surprised
us
about
this
brew
was
the
vibrant
red
coloring
and
the
overt
hoppiness
to
the
beers
final
taste
this
is
certainly
a
unique
doppel
d
smooth
clean
and
a
great
beer
lots
of
flavor
and
quite
complex
hops
and
malts
mix
well
together
to
give
this
a
very
good
taste
that
easily
hides
any
trace
that
there
is
8
2
alcohol
in
this
wonderful
beer
i
really
do
like
this
brew
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
good
its
a
full
bodied
well
balanced
beer
that
starts
strong
and
finishes
clean
waited
a
long
time
to
try
this
not
the
best
dopplebock
ive
ever
tried
but
i
like
it
and
its
very
readily
available
im
sure
ill
get
it
again
bottle
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
mahagony
color
with
a
nice
1
12
cinger
slightly
off
white
white
that
collars
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
rather
subtle
and
clean
with
notes
of
malt
and
caramel
medium
mouthfeel
the
flavors
i
get
out
of
this
are
raisin
plum
banana
all
mixed
with
a
slight
bitterness
the
alcohol
notes
are
also
rather
subdued
the
mild
bitterness
as
the
end
is
not
something
i
am
super
keen
on
but
otherwise
this
is
a
pretty
nice
drinker
d
good
drinkability
even
at
8
very
true
to
german
style
makes
me
reminisce
of
the
salvator
keller
d
fairly
high
for
a
double
bock
with
this
much
abv
one
of
my
go
to
beers
when
i
am
at
a
bar
with
less
than
desirable
options
on
draft
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
great
for
a
cold
day
like
we
have
been
having
around
here
lately
maybe
i
had
an
old
or
bad
sample
worthy
of
a
name
like
troegenator
not
today
and
im
generally
a
big
fan
of
troegs
troegs
you
have
made
these
hard
days
simpler
d
complex
and
deep
very
robust
and
savory
strong
with
a
bit
of
rum
sweetness
and
bite
if
served
cold
you
dont
notice
its
8
smooth
and
goes
down
very
easy
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
each
beer
gets
better
definitely
worth
getting
d
after
3
of
them
i
started
to
get
full
and
a
little
bit
of
a
headache
i
dont
know
if
it
had
anything
to
do
with
the
phillies
going
back
and
forth
with
the
giants
all
night
but
i
only
drank
the
3
i
think
i
could
have
finished
6
to
myself
but
i
would
probably
end
up
pretty
reckless
needless
to
say
you
can
definitely
drink
a
lot
of
these
d
really
drinkable
for
the
abv
it
tastes
like
5
5
or
6
tops
i
could
have
3
or
4
in
an
evening
easily
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
bordering
on
chestnut
with
a
nice
off
white
head
however
not
much
lacing
at
all
as
it
goes
down
the
side
of
my
pilsner
glass
the
nose
brings
some
lighter
amounts
of
dark
fruits
as
well
as
caramel
and
toffee
the
flavor
is
mainly
dominated
by
a
bit
of
caramel
and
some
bread
medium
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
booze
drinks
quite
well
after
writing
this
review
and
still
nursing
the
second
half
of
the
bottle
it
occurred
to
me
just
how
close
the
aroma
and
smell
of
this
beer
are
to
rum
cake
from
the
bahamas
good
rum
cake
you
get
from
asking
locals
in
nassau
where
to
get
it
not
bacardi
cake
from
the
airport
theyre
very
similar
noticing
this
has
made
me
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
more
the
beer
is
a
lovely
full
bodied
brew
as
it
settles
after
the
pour
with
a
creamy
head
that
is
slow
to
go
away
the
color
is
dark
with
a
shine
in
the
light
the
smell
is
full
of
robust
caramel
and
nice
malts
it
tastes
like
a
very
well
brewed
doppelbock
should
it
is
big
and
strong
slightly
bitter
and
very
robust
it
feels
big
strong
and
robust
as
well
and
is
drinkable
but
not
a
beer
you
wan
to
have
too
many
of
the
troegenator
is
a
style
i
really
like
and
a
brew
that
i
think
is
great
d
totally
drinkable
im
not
a
bock
fan
in
general
but
i
gotta
say
that
i
didnt
hate
this
one
the
best
and
only
dopplebock
ive
had
haha
pretty
tasty
easy
drinking
definitely
worth
some
more
goes
taste
is
better
than
any
doublebock
ive
ever
had
excellent
mix
of
sugar
and
dark
fruit
with
a
medium
body
that
is
very
smooth
no
discernable
alcohol
flavor
overall
very
enjoyable
drink
drinks
easily
for
a
dopplebock
troegenators
not
too
overbearing
and
pretty
enjoyable
of
course
it
pales
in
comparison
to
salvator
but
it
can
compete
surprisingly
with
some
of
the
other
german
doppelbocks
very
nice
from
troeegs
believe
the
hype
this
beer
has
garnered
a
cult
status
over
the
years
and
its
a
delicious
beer
that
easily
ranks
within
our
top
doppelbocks
worldwide
d
well
put
to
gether
doppelbock
medium
bodied
easy
drinker
some
taste
of
dark
malt
caramel
and
nutmeg
i
got
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
i
recommend
this
brew
14
d
for
an
8
2
this
is
nearly
sessionable
good
stuff
and
a
nice
surprise
meh
drinks
ok
nothing
special
very
safe
though
alcohol
is
apparent
its
not
as
strong
as
it
could
be
for
an
8
beer
d
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
sip
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
but
theres
no
way
that
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
given
its
high
alcohol
content
deep
mahogany
red
in
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
that
didnt
hold
up
for
long
no
cap
or
lacings
sweet
malty
aroma
including
dark
fruit
aromas
dark
cherry
and
plum
medium
to
full
bodied
smooth
and
a
bit
syrupy
flavors
are
similar
to
aromas
sweet
malty
flavors
in
the
beginning
that
lead
caramalized
fruit
with
a
bit
of
spice
and
malty
sweet
finish
nicely
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
probably
the
only
thing
holding
this
beer
back
for
me
is
the
sweetness
frankly
im
partial
to
strong
beers
but
its
definitely
worth
trying
at
least
once
d
smooth
clean
and
a
great
beer
lots
of
flavor
and
quite
complex
yet
its
easy
to
just
ignore
that
and
quaff
a
glass
or
two
over
all
a
good
beer
creamy
warm
flavors
d
i
would
love
to
drink
a
sixer
of
this
but
am
regretting
buying
the
bomber
was
hoping
for
something
more
unusual
drinkabilty
this
aint
a
bad
beer
there
should
be
much
more
to
it
i
wouldnt
buy
a
case
of
this
nor
would
i
order
it
out
maybe
since
ive
had
ayinger
celebrator
im
spoiled
but
man
the
difference
is
huge
troegs
where
is
the
kick
overall
i
am
a
big
fan
of
troegs
however
this
is
one
brew
in
their
lineup
that
i
think
could
use
some
work
admittedly
this
style
isnt
my
favorite
but
this
is
still
sort
of
a
by
the
numbers
doppelbock
overall
its
a
good
brew
not
my
favorite
from
troegs
by
any
means
but
i
was
impressed
this
time
around
i
had
the
pleasure
of
doing
a
brew
tour
earlier
in
the
spring
and
tried
this
didnt
think
too
much
of
it
then
but
after
giving
it
another
chance
it
was
good
will
definitely
buy
another
case
in
the
future
nice
way
of
introducing
me
to
the
dopplebock
style
thanks
troegs
pours
a
deep
darkreddish
amber
with
a
decently
thick
respectable
amount
of
light
brown
head
the
smell
is
fairly
simple
with
pronounced
malt
tones
a
given
taste
is
again
malty
with
a
hint
of
bread
and
caramel
throughout
the
drink
the
head
subsides
more
and
more
with
littletono
lacing
as
the
mouthfeel
begins
to
seem
more
and
more
light
and
hot
a
stark
contrast
to
how
it
began
moderate
drinkability
because
of
the
high
abv
8
but
i
would
reckon
that
could
be
the
main
selling
point
of
this
beer
it
was
for
me
great
dopplebock
looking
forward
to
another
pint
d
a
double
bock
is
personally
a
very
drinkable
style
i
find
this
troegenator
to
be
very
well
done
i
would
love
to
have
this
all
the
time
great
pa
brew
overall
this
beer
smells
clean
with
a
slight
alcohol
note
served
from
a
tap
it
poured
nicely
with
a
thick
tan
head
and
mohagany
body
carbonation
is
slight
and
lacing
is
very
present
it
has
a
rich
full
malt
body
with
nutty
and
salty
notes
very
roasted
and
thirst
quenching
it
is
somewhat
light
on
mouthfeel
for
this
style
and
is
not
drying
this
beer
is
drinkableanytime
and
is
not
as
heavy
as
most
dopple
bocks
relatively
true
to
style
i
can
see
why
its
one
of
troegs
flagships
this
a
good
beer
that
is
always
a
good
bang
for
your
buck
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
little
below
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
its
an
excellent
beer
overall
its
very
flavorful
and
well
balanced
for
the
style
it
doesnt
feel
like
a
big
beer
either
and
went
down
remarkably
smooth
very
good
overall
d
this
is
a
very
tasty
dopplebock
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
despite
its
high
abv
and
its
style
as
a
double
bock
this
one
is
not
overpowering
or
too
complex
the
different
flavors
balance
each
other
out
making
this
one
frighteningly
easy
to
drink
d
the
alcohol
taste
puts
me
off
a
little
as
does
the
complexity
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
good
example
of
the
style
out
of
a
bomber
bottle
this
beer
was
a
perfectly
clear
rubyred
color
with
lots
of
rising
carbonation
and
three
fingers
of
tan
head
that
quickly
fell
back
to
a
onefinger
layer
the
retention
was
soso
overall
and
left
small
spots
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
malty
blend
of
raisins
caramel
toffee
alcohol
currants
and
hint
of
sourness
the
flavors
were
similar
minus
the
sour
element
and
plus
some
wood
nuts
and
some
light
toasted
malt
the
raisins
really
came
through
in
the
middle
and
though
it
was
surprisingly
dangerously
drinkable
for
8
2
the
alcohol
heat
did
really
come
through
towards
the
end
as
it
warmed
up
i
also
picked
up
some
semisweet
chocolate
rich
and
maltastic
this
one
really
coated
my
tongue
the
mouthfeel
was
average
the
body
full
and
the
carbonation
good
too
drinkability
is
good
for
what
it
is
i
wouldnt
want
this
after
a
long
run
an
afternoon
of
yardwork
or
a
barbeque
in
the
dog
days
of
summer
on
the
other
hand
id
say
its
a
good
warmweather
dessert
beer
drunk
cold
and
out
of
a
goblet
overall
a
decent
doppelbock
fairly
easy
to
drinking
big
and
malty
with
some
rich
flavors
which
is
good
for
the
style
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
id
drink
this
again
but
probably
wouldnt
go
too
far
out
of
my
way
for
it
drinkability
although
it
isnt
a
typical
bock
troegenators
double
bock
is
delicious
enough
to
drink
a
few
of
just
be
careful
if
you
make
a
session
of
it
because
of
the
8
2
abv
d
pretty
drinkable
this
is
a
very
interesting
tasting
beer
and
troegss
crafting
decisions
with
this
are
clearly
very
bold
this
is
not
an
ordinary
doppelbock
tastes
a
lot
like
founders
curmudgeon
if
founders
had
more
modesty
with
that
brew
god
love
them
they
are
great
but
i
think
they
could
have
done
better
with
that
brew
you
come
to
expect
great
things
from
troegs
this
is
what
they
do
time
after
time
and
this
is
another
great
brew
that
i
hope
i
will
have
the
chance
to
enjoy
again
sometime
soon
solid
one
of
the
go
to
beers
alcohol
prevents
sessioning
but
overall
a
very
good
beer
pours
a
rich
mahogany
color
with
1
finger
of
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
with
no
lacing
big
malt
aroma
greets
the
nose
with
lots
of
toasted
and
molasses
notes
mixing
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
with
a
big
toasted
malty
body
this
beer
is
all
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
piney
hops
on
the
way
out
before
a
very
astringent
finish
body
is
full
and
i
would
rate
drinkability
as
very
good
but
im
partial
to
the
style
overall
a
very
tasty
db
that
hides
its
8
2
abv
very
well
i
may
be
exaggerating
the
cough
drop
tip
a
bit
but
im
calling
it
like
i
see
it
this
is
a
pretty
damn
fine
beer
nonetheless
a
great
take
on
the
style
i
will
be
abusing
a
sixer
at
some
point
in
the
future
drinkability
thought
it
was
a
bit
heavy
and
undercarbonated
given
the
deep
red
hue
i
was
expecting
more
roast
character
but
to
no
avail
not
great
but
certainly
not
bad
d
as
i
said
combination
of
the
overthetop
taste
and
mouthfeel
make
it
hard
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
i
guess
thats
what
8
2
will
do
o
simple
beer
not
too
much
going
on
although
the
taste
good
pours
a
very
dark
amber
almost
brown
colour
started
out
with
a
thick
white
head
but
that
dissipated
without
too
much
lacing
smells
very
fruity
almost
like
prunes
or
raisins
taste
has
the
fruitiness
with
a
grainy
roasted
malt
flavour
i
think
im
getting
some
nuttiness
too
there
is
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
but
not
too
much
very
smooth
carbonation
clear
dark
amber
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
quickly
burns
off
into
a
thin
cap
a
bit
light
looking
for
the
style
sweet
roasty
malt
chocolate
and
some
dark
fruit
make
up
the
nose
rich
and
toasty
malt
flavors
are
nicely
balanced
with
spicy
noble
hop
bittering
the
alcohol
is
really
well
hidden
medium
bodied
with
bright
carbonation
a
dangerously
drinkable
8
abv
dopplebock
i
tried
this
in
a
bottle
recently
and
just
had
it
on
draft
im
rating
the
draft
version
because
it
was
just
a
little
better
but
not
much
difference
right
before
i
tried
the
bottled
version
i
tried
a
very
expensive
and
german
beer
of
the
same
style
i
was
impressed
that
this
beer
really
held
its
own
it
has
a
slightly
thick
dark
brownreddish
color
and
a
slightly
viscous
feel
dark
fruit
and
malt
comes
through
very
little
hop
presence
i
cant
wait
to
revisit
this
one
in
cold
weather
troegenator
appears
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
lace
of
tanned
bubbles
across
the
top
for
a
head
faint
rising
bubbles
of
carbonation
rise
to
the
surface
and
collect
around
the
inside
perimeter
of
the
glass
and
appear
with
a
color
that
is
slightly
stained
yellow
aroma
of
this
beer
is
pretty
much
dominated
by
the
scent
of
malt
leaning
towards
being
a
bit
like
dark
caramel
or
a
bit
like
molasses
only
a
faint
trace
of
hops
is
present
and
the
slightest
touch
of
butter
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
flavors
of
caramel
slight
molasses
and
just
a
bit
of
buttery
tones
with
a
minor
hop
bitterness
and
nice
alcohol
warmth
medium
feel
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
increasing
amount
of
alcohol
character
as
the
beer
warms
once
troegenator
warms
it
displays
a
greater
depth
of
the
malt
profile
with
flavors
that
are
at
times
a
bit
nutty
overall
pretty
good
after
not
being
that
fond
of
victorys
st
victorious
ive
come
to
the
conclusion
that
im
just
that
big
a
fan
of
this
style
and
rarely
seek
out
another
bock
after
finishing
one
knowing
that
this
is
a
personal
preference
i
rated
it
against
my
impression
of
st
victorious
when
it
came
to
drinkability
to
be
fair
the
main
difference
between
the
aged
version
and
the
fresh
version
is
the
aroma
and
taste
the
aged
version
is
much
more
raisiny
and
is
starting
to
show
signs
of
oxidation
from
the
flavors
of
figs
and
slight
sherry
im
glad
i
found
this
bottle
delicious
i
recommend
buying
a
few
of
these
and
tasting
them
as
the
years
pass
d
very
drinkable
for
the
style
despite
not
reflecting
the
style
very
well
imo
overall
a
fun
beer
to
try
but
not
overly
impressed
and
certainly
doesnt
compare
to
the
true
doppels
of
germany
overall
a
great
beer
that
hides
its
high
abv
with
silky
smooth
flavors
not
a
beer
that
will
blow
you
away
but
a
beer
that
does
a
great
job
of
representing
the
style
overall
a
decent
doppelbock
but
not
quite
what
i
was
hoping
from
troegs
its
way
too
sweet
not
enough
dark
wheat
and
toasty
malt
flavors
and
a
slight
bad
lager
aftertaste
however
its
still
a
solid
beer
i
have
to
be
careful
on
the
drinkability
rating
i
prefer
a
beer
with
more
hop
notes
and
many
times
way
more
hop
notes
but
this
was
the
first
dopplebock
that
ive
tried
and
its
not
a
favorite
to
be
fair
id
have
to
say
that
if
you
like
malt
forward
brews
you
may
very
well
enjoy
this
cheers
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
pretty
balanced
and
a
good
beer
to
have
with
a
meal
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
nothing
super
special
it
appears
slightly
hazy
reddish
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
falls
to
a
ring
smells
of
sweet
roasted
malt
caramel
honey
dark
fruit
a
rich
and
sweet
nose
the
taste
is
trailing
the
smell
somewhat
rich
and
malty
nutty
some
caramel
but
doesnt
have
the
depth
of
the
nose
the
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
average
in
level
overall
a
decent
brew
but
certainly
not
great
thick
dark
brown
brew
with
mahogany
highlights
when
held
to
a
light
34
of
mocha
foam
settles
to
a
dense
and
bubbly
layer
hearty

nose
dark
candy
sugar
a
bit

warm

scotchlike
flavors
of

pretty
unique
and
enjoyable
im
finding
a
bunch
of
different
things
in
here
as
it
warms
thick
malt
backbone
loads
of
bread
burnt
caramel
grapefruit
rind
mulling
spices
walnut
black
cherry
finish
is
long
and
moderately
bitter
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
good
carbonation
etoh
well
hidden
very
hearty
and
filling
dits
not
a
bad
substitute
for
ayinger
celebrator
in
terms
of
availability
and
price
but
not
taste
for
8
or
so
it
goes
down
very
easy
that
alcohol
is
almost
virtually
hidden
so
be
careful
troegenator
is
a
dense
vermillion
lager
with
a
dense
beige
head
that
fades
to
a
film
with
oily
bubbles
that
leaves
outstanding
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
little
faint
with
notes
of
slightly
sweet
malt
and
bread
along
with
something
herbal
and
grassy
its
mediumfull
bodied
and
pretty
smooth
the
finish
is
a
little
starchy
and
syrupy
all
of
the
flavor
comes
late
in
the
taste
theres
a
pretty
prominent
herbal
bitterness
and
the
sweetness
hints
toward
dark
fruit
and
raisins
alcohol
is
present
in
the
flavor
as
black
pepper
and
it
provides
some
warmth
i
find
it
pretty
difficult
to
get
excited
about
lagers
i
dont
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
kind
of
beer
but
i
would
gladly
drink
another
one
of
these
pours
dark
amberred
nice
pour
bubbles
nicely
and
reduces
to
a
light
foam
around
the
edge
taste
is
malty
sticky
syrupy
thick
beer
i
havent
had
alot
of
the
doppel
but
i
have
had
similar
beers
i
have
liked
more
taste
the
hops
slightly
has
a
bit
of
a
sticky
after
taste
somethings
seems
to
be
missing
for
me
i
think
it
could
use
a
little
more
flavor
a
little
something
extra
maybe
it
is
just
staying
true
to
the
style
but
i
think
it
is
pretty
average
overall
for
a
premium
micro
brew
i
would
expect
something
like
this
from
sam
adams
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
my
1st
troegs
id
try
a
different
beer
from
them
though
if
doppelbock
is
your
thing
you
might
be
more
into
it
the
pour
is
a
redchestnut
brown
with
a
sizable
off
white
head
after
a
pretty
aggressive
pour
smells
of
sweet
toffee
and
caramel
a
pretty
staggering
amount
of
sweetness
for
me
lots
of
caramel
malts
and
some
dark
dried
fruits
cherries
prunes
and
raisins
the
alcohol
was
hidden
pretty
well
pretty
smooth
going
down
just
too
sweet
for
me
color
was
a
unique
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
while
not
a
whole
lot
of
scent
until
it
warmed
up
a
bit
earthy
malts
taste
is
very
sweet
and
molasseslike
hardly
any
hops
to
speak
of
but
in
the
end
good
like
a
beer

feel
and
very
easy

with

that
fell
fairly
fast
scents
of
the
rich
molasses
and
toffee
took
over
at
first
and
with
a
little
sit
some
heady
fruit
odors
came
forward
in
particular
some
raisin
a
nice
medium
body
with
a
small
carbonation
enhances
the
flavors
that
come
through
again
the
molasses
and
actually
a
hint
of
melted
butter
which
while
off
putting
at
first
grew
on
me
the
alcohol
is
definitely
present
which
serves
to
warm
you
up
quite
a
bit
leaving
you
quite
content
after
drinking
i
wouldnt
recommend
any
more
than
2
at
a
sitting
however
overall
i
liked
it
and
enjoyed
sitting
around
with
my
buddies
on
a
warm
spring
day
with
huge
mugs
of
beer
while
not
my
favorite
dopple
it
remains
pretty
true
to
style
and
is
something
i
would
enjoy
again
when
im
in
a
malty
mood
d
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
nicely
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
alcohol
is
discreet
and
feel
is
so
smooth
that
this
one
could
disappear
a
little
too
quickly
troegenator
is
pretty
tostyle
but
it
didnt
wow
me
i
appreciated
the
low
carbonation
and
drinkability
of
this
still
hefty
brew

overall
this
is

i
have
had

i
really
enjoy
this
offering
from
troegs
and
find
myself
liking
them
more
and
more
with
each
beer
i
try
by
them
dthis
beer
is
good
for
sipping
and
enjoying
this
beer
was
very
filling
and
probably
would
not
be
the
best
beer
to
drink
for
a
longer

drinkability
given
that
this
is
a
hefty
brew
in

the

can

no
this

d
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
doppelbock
the
8
2
is
not
obvious
at
all
it
drinks
like
a
much
lower
abv
beer
a
very
nice
doppelbock
for
the
late
winter
season
d
very
much
so
considering
how
wellbalanced
it
is
the
appearance
of
this
brew
was
quite
nice
it
poured
a
deep
red
amber
with
an
off
white
head
little
lacing
left
on
the
glass
however
the
smell
was
bit
of
an
oddball
for
me
and
i
couldnt
quite
tell
what
i
was
smelling
there
was
a
definite
fruitiness
to
it
as
well
as
some
caramel
this
beer
has
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
it
didnt
tingle
too
much
but
nor
was
it
non
existent
the
initial
taste
of
the
beer
was
somewhat
sweet
with
an
interesting
dark
fruit
and
malt
flavor
the
finishing
flavor
was
wheat
and
alcohol
cant
say
that
the
alcohol
is
masked
during
the
drinking
process
but
it
is
very
pronounced
at
the
end
overall
this
is
an
interesting
brew
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
dark
muddy
crimson
small
off
white
head
the
smell
is
sweet
ripe
dark
fruits
and
bready
malt
the
taste
is
very
sweet
dark
cherries
real
ones
and
other
dark
fruits
with
bready
malt
in
the
background
the
finish
is
a
little
bit
cloying
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
and
i
found
the
alcohol
very
noticeable
i
didnt
expect
quite
this
level
of
booziness
due
to
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
one
is
more
than
enough
i
got
three
troegs
beers
as
extra
in
the
trade
and
this
is
the
first
that
has
kind
of
let
me
down
that
being
said
i
am
starting
to
think
i
just
dont
like
doppelbocks
that
much
in
general
d
very
drinkable
and
almost
refreshing
after
the
heat
its
far
too
delicious
to
sip
a
danger
at
8
2
to
be
sure
not
a
perfect
dopplebock
by
any
means
but
a
seriously
tasty
one
d
at
8
2
dangerously
drinkable
very
sweet
with
a
thin
body
that
makes
it
go
down
easy
big
malt
profile
is
nicely
balanced
so
that
this
isnt
just
a
beer
for
someone
with
a
sweet
tooth
not
really
much
else
to
say
here
except
try
it
a
great
beer
in
my
opinion
just
had
this
beer
on
tap
and
wow
another
great
beer
from
troegs
a
great
ruby
color
with
a
creamy
3
finger
head
served
in
a
12oz
tulip
glass
slight
bread
aromas
are
present
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
sweetness
continues
in
the
palate
but
nothing
over
powering
perfectly
balanced
finishes
smooth
d
very
good
drinkability
as
the
alcohol
remains
mostly
hidden
i
could
easily
down
a
couple
bombers
of
this
with
how
smooth
it
goes
down
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
simply
is
nothing
special
and
not
all
that
food
friendly
or
drinkable
however
bottle
has
a
cool
label
ill
give
it
that
pours
a
deep
reddish
chestnut
brown
with
a
respectable
creamy
head
on
top
a
big
hit
of
dark
stone
fruits
hits
me
with
my
first
whiff
but
further
sniffs
reveal
a
bready
malt
sweetness
that
id
expect
from
a
doppelbock
the
flavor
is
almost
an
inverse
of
the
aroma
with
a
dry
caramel
malt
sweetness
first
and
the
dark
fruits
creeping
in
underneath
certainly
not
overly
sweet
though
and
a
combination
of
spicyearthy
hops
and
alcohol
follows
to
provide
balance
the
texture
continues
on
a
similar
theme
with
an
undercurrent
of
sweet
smoothness
at
the
base
and
a
prickly
combination
of
carbonation
hops
and
booze
riding
on
top
it
does
seem
a
bit
boozier
than
i
would
have
expected
at
8
2
but
its
interesting
complex
and
a
welcome
diversion
on
a
cold
rainy
winter
night
overall
a
nice
example
of
this
style
plan
to
age
a
few
bottle
to
see
how
it
does
quite
a
nice
brew
from
the
troegs
bros
d
a
really
solid
doppelbock
reminds
me
of
some
of
those
ive
had
in
germany
but
with
a
bit
more
toffee
and
caramel
flavor
pours
a
clear
deep
amber
color
with
a
little
more
than
a
finger
width
of
head
doesnt
stick
around
long
and
leaves
very
little
evidence
however
has
a
great
malt
nose
with
a
mix
of
sweet
notes
like
caramel
and
toffee
and
some
roasted
nuttyearth
scents
taste
is
delicious
and
a
bit
unique
for
the
style
the
ratio
of
hops
to
malt
is
fairly
balanced
with
some
earthyspicy
hops
making
an
appearance
in
the
palate
has
a
full
mouthfeel
without
feeling
heavy
or
chewy
consistent
the
whole
way
through
a
fantastic
offering
from
troegs
and
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
pours
a
dark
reddish
color
with
half
inch
of
tan
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
cap
hardly
any
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
good
aroma
with
a
toffee
malt
element
taking
charge
hints
of
nuts
probably
almonds
is
also
quite
noticeable
strong
malt
flavor
as
well
toffee
and
almonds
being
the
most
noticeable
elements
not
as
sweet
as
other
doppelbocks
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
the
body
is
not
as
full
and
rich
as
i
would
like
still
maintains
some
substance
and
a
nice
soft
carbonation
more
drinkable
than
other
doppelbocks
because
it
is
not
as
sweet
the
alcohol
being
as
hidden
as
it
is
could
make
this
one
sneak
up
on
the
drinker
d
how
did
i
manage
to
go
so
long
without
reviewing
one
of
my
favorite
brewerys
flagship
beers
shame
on
me
this
is
another
one
i
take
for
granted
simply
because
its
available
all
over
central
pa
great
during
the
colder
months
troegenator
is
simply
just
a
fine
example
of
a
dopplebock
had
a
snow
day
in
ny
so
i
decided
this
would
be
a
nice
one
to
have
during
a
lazy
movie
marathon
pours
a
dark
colour
with
a
red
tint
you
can
see
in
the
light
with
a
big
foamy
tan
head
smells
sweet
and
hearty
like
stone
fruits
and
nuts
especially
almond
theres
a
strong
yeasty
kick
too
the
taste
is
equally
pleasing
its
got
a
big
flavor
and
whatever
those
fruits
are
plums
raisins
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
you
definitely
taste
them
the
sweetness
comes
through
but
has
a
nice
balance
with
the
bitter
strong
hoppiness
that
you
get
towards
the
end
the
mouth
feel
is
thick
heavy
but
smooth
its
substantial
but
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
brew
drinkability
fantastic
beer
but
the
only
reason
i
wouldnt
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
is
its
abv
however
its
a
great
brew
that
is
designed
for
days
you
want
to
warm
up
d
amazing
so
smooth
each
sip
i
had
left
me
wanting
more
one
of
my
favorites
right
now
i
prefer
this
one
at
at
a
warmer
temp
so
it
got
even
better
as
the
glass
went
on
interestingly
troegenator
improves
enormously
with
age
softens
nicely
and
shows
many
of
the
complexities
of
a
barleywine
plus
roasted
flavors
in
a
relatively
light
compact
form
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
with
no
bottled
on
date
this
is
a
beer
i
have
had
many
times
and
certainly
enjoy
each
time
a
dark
amber
tan
color
with
about
2
inches
of
abundant
head
malts
and
caramel
dominate
the
flavors
with
roasted
almost
nutlike
scents
mouthfeel
is
great
and
highly
drinkable
in
nature
very
relaxed
and
drinkable
dopplebock
i
would
have
no
problem
having
several
of
these
in
a
row
im
definitely
buying
this
one
again
an
average
drinkability
that
paired
quite
well
with
a
brie
cheese
beef
burger
on
a
lightly
toasted
english
muffin
dangerously
drinkable
though
good
rich
flavour
and
very
pleasant
cheers
this
is
an
exceptionally
drinkable
brew
it
has
such
a
wonderful
clarity
to
the
palate
which
leaves
it
quaffable
and
delicious
despite
the
alcohol
content
this
is
truly
comparable
to
the
best
german
examples
once
again
the
us
shows
me
what
it
is
capable
of
tröegs
really
know
what
they
are
doing
with
this
brew
and
showcase
a
truly
worldclass
doppelbock
astonishingly
good
overall
sort
of
disappointed
even
among
a
style
that
im
not
particularly
a
fan
of
this
isnt
among
my
favorites
the
beer
pours
reddishbrown
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
cherry
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
sweet
malt
and
a
heavy
cherry
flavor
you
get
some
caramel
malt
but
the
sweet
cherries
are
the
predominant
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
pours
a
nice
reddish
amber
color
with
a
big
creamy
head
aroma
is
of
fruity
malts
caramel
and
bit
of
cherry
taste
is
lots
of
malty
flavors
with
some
spice
and
a
hint
of
caramel
a
very
good
brew
with
a
lot
hidden
inside
it
is
extremely
drinkable
very
smooth
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
the
first
time
i
had
this
it
tasted
like
a
hop
fest
but
it
has
either
mellowed
over
the
years
or
my
taste
for
hops
is
more
tolerable
regardless
it
beat
the
pants
off
my
last
years
tastes
like
a
spicy
lager
to
now
a
damn
great
bock
has
a
very
nice
semi
spicy
taste
to
it
has
spice
taste
sort
of
similar
to
midas
touch
but
it
doesnt
flare
build
and
disappear
like
midas
touch
does
its
just
there
and
stays
there
this
was
my
first
experience
w
a
doppelbock
very
thin
beer
w
little
head
and
lacing
the
color
was
a
light
amber
brown
you
could
see
though
there
was
really
no
scent
going
on
very
bland
the
taste
was
a
little
better
but
i
suppose
this
isnt
my
style
i
will
say
it
was
a
high
drinkability
and
goes
down
pretty
smooth
definitely
a
troegs
beer
drinkability
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
there
are
better
dopplebocks
lots
better
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
overall
its
just
not
big
enough
tasting
malt
wise
after
my
first
glass
it
reminds
me
somewhat
of
the
spatan
optimator
this
is
a
compliment
to
the
accuracy
to
the
beer
style
would
go
great
with
some
traditional
german
fare
tonight
i
had
it
with
a
bowl
of
homemade
chili
and
i
thought
they
went
very
well
together
a
treat
to
find
this
in
massachusetts
now
overall
this
is
a
wellcrafted
doppelbock
by
troegs
and
certainly
one
of
the
more
approachable
for
the
style
recommended
dthis
is
very
good
lots
of
sweet
malty
flavors
and
a
huge
body
a
definite
winner
for
me
head
is
thin
and
just
sits
flat
on
the
top
great
clear
amber
color
with
perfect
little
bubbles
floating
around
lightly
not
really
getting
much
on
the
smell
just
a
hint
of
malt
and
hops
nothing
pronounced
on
the
first
sips
i
am
getting
roasted
malts
and
light
hops
on
the
next
couple
i
am
picking
up
a
nice
caramel
taste
at
the
end
very
well
balanced
flavors
all
around
as
for
mouthful
it
is
def
thick
and
chewy
leavy
your
mouth
dry
wil
probably
follow
this
up
with
some
water
makes
a
great
winter
brew
on
these
colder
days
to
warm
me
up
will
start
adding
this
one
to
my
regular
rotation
another
great
one
from
troegs
d
very
good
drinkability
here
smooth
flavor
and
mouthfeel
makes
for
a
beer
that
goes
down
easily
drinkable
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
but
a
decent
brew
none
the
less
overall
you
can
tell
that
the
bros
at
troegs
brew
the
beers
that
they
enjoy
to
the
benefit
of
their
customers
if
you
are
fortunate
to
be
able
to
venture
to
harrisburg
you
should
definitely
stop
in
for
a
saturday
tour
i
also
recommend
picking
up
the
locally
handcrafted
trogenator
ceramic
drinking
horns
it
holds
the
full
22oz
and
the
only
downside
is
that
you
cant
put
it
down
once
its
filled
d
another
great
brew
from
troegs
and
a
must
have
for
the
winter
season
d
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
too
many
of
these
aside
from
the
high
abv
it
is
a
bit
thick
and
filling
enjoyable
nonetheless
d
despite
the
high
abv
this
is
a
pretty
good
session
beer
still
the
abv
is
hidden
so
well
it
can
definitely
sneak
up
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
with
good
flavor
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
d
all
night
a
very
well
made
beer
really
no
complaints
troegs
strikes
again
d
highly
drinkable
the
8
2
alch
is
hidden
well
very
nice
full
tasty
dopplebock
that
cleans
up
enough
for
another
drink
but
not
so
much
to
forget
about
it
d
its
solid
but
not
particularly
amazing
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
although
i
doubt
ill
make
the
effort
to
trade
for
it
poured
copper
brown
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
but
very
good
lacing
the
smell
was
very
malty
with
some
hints
of
caramel
and
molasses
the
taste
revealed
the
same
but
was
very
malty
sweet
what
aids
the
consumption
of
this
beer
is
the
thinner
than
expected
mouthfeel
certainly
helps
the
sessionability
too
one
more
thing
the
alcohol
content
is
fairly
wellhidden
very
sweet
beer
with
a
taste
of
roasted
malt
and
a
touch
of
carbonation
and
hops
overall
i
find
it
to
be
well
balanced
all
around
the
8
2
abv
just
starts
to
show
itself
in
the
end
this
is
a
great
change
of
pace
from
my
usual
favorite
ipas
the
only
negative
i
can
think
of
is
that
it
may
not
be
the
best
session
beer
id
much
rather
sip
and
enjoy
this
than
pound
down
and
be
drunk
after
a
few
beers
this
beautiful
beverage
was
poured
from
a
22
oz
into
my
favorite
pint
glass
the
copper
color
and
medium
head
was
a
sight
to
behold
the
sweet
smell
was
second
only
to
the
ultrasweet
taste
no
hops
at
all
this
was
all
malt
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
thin
for
the
alcohol
content
this
was
dangerously
easy
to
drink
d
really
good
for
a
dopplebock
in
that
i
could
have
a
few
and
not
feel
too
full
but
im
sure
id
be
pretty
intoxicated
rather
than
detail
each
individual
attribute
ill
just
say
that
i
really
like
this
beer
its
a
great
example
of
a
double
bock
it
has
a
heavy
smoky
rich
flavor
with
great
maltiness
that
finishes
pretty
clean
definately
a
strong
beer
not
overpowering
but
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
great
beer
that
i
love
to
drink
every
fallwinter
not
a
bad
choice
for
a
doppel
d
this
is
not
my
go
to
style
for
beer
but
i
am
excited
about
pairing
this
with
the
turkey
to
challenge
my
wifes
red
wine
pick
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
am
glad
to
have
had
an
opportunity
to
try
d
a
nice
doppelbock
well
crafted
beer
is
super
smooth
wonderful
malt
sweetness
nice
medium
to
full
body
no
harsh
flavors
or
solvents
finishes
nicely
has
some
dryness
on
the
backend
drinkability
high
drinkability
an
average
dopplebock
certainly
not
the
best
i
prefer
the
german
versions
better
and
this
one
certainly
doesnt
stack
up
still
worth
a
try
though
im
really
surprised
with
how
easy
it
is
to
take
down
this
beer
and
giving
it
a
second
chance
i
didnt
like
it
the
first
time
around
was
a
great
idea
its
way
too
drinkable
and
certainly
one
of
the
better
american
versions
of
this
classic
german
style
sweeter
than
your
average
doublebock
but
nice
if
you
like
the
style
d
not
bad
for
being
a
boozy
beer
this
also
is
a
good
beer
for
cellaring
d
high
this
stuff
is
really
great
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
makes
me
proud
to
say
im
from
the
burg
d
i
recommend
drinking
this
at
almost
room
temp
the
flavors
are
much
more
pronounced
at
that
point
really
easy
to
drink
with
no
offensive
smells
or
tastes
i
just
want
more
body
probably
my
favorite
beer
from
pennsylvania
and
the
first
bock
besides
aventinus
that
ive
had
a
chance
to
truely
enjoy
overall
i
like
this
beer
alot
and
would
definitely
seek
it
out
on
my
future
journeys
to
the
beer
peddling
establishments
i
frequent
d
i
started
struggling
to
finish
towards
the
end
of
the
drink
drinkable
but
a
bit
sweet
and
the
alcohol
does
creep
up
on
you
i
liked
it
alot
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
still
a
very
enjoyable
beer
would
go
great
with
asian
foods
for
some
reason
it
reminded
me
of
something
i
get
at
asian
japanese
restaurants
which
is
what
made
me
think
of
ginger
but
still
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
not
great
but
another
nice
effort
by
troegs
dr
as
diana
krall
would
sing
swonderful
smarvelous
really
really
good
the
sweetness
could
get
to
be
too
much
after
a
bit
but
man
one
ought
to
be
enough
a
very
solid
rendition
of
the
style
i
have
been
targeting
doppelbocks
lately
and
so
i
find
myself
being
harder
on
this
one
just
due
to
comparison
to
others
this
a
a
very
easy
drinking
version
of
the
style
but
is
a
step
back
from
some
of
the
top
german
ones
and
is
way
behind
in
intensity
you
see
in
the
sam
adams
version
this
might
actually
be
a
gateway
to
the
style
you
dont
taste
or
smell
the
booze
in
this
one
and
the
flavors
are
clean
and
bright
and
balanced
but
seem
a
bit
lighter
than
i
would
have
wanted
still
i
would
buy
this
again
great
beer
for
the
fall
or
winter
this
beer
is
ultra
drinkable
its
sweetness
hides
any
abv
in
aroma
or
flavor
very
delicious
brew
on
a
cold
30
degree
morning
d
i
had
several
and
they
were
very
smooth
so
i
would
say
pretty
darn
drinkable
d
nice
and
slow
on
a
cool
fall
evening
perfect
d
absurdly
drinkable
and
overall
enjoyable
8
2
beer
this
from
a
guy
who
doesnt
like
lagers
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
it
starts
to
get
a
little
sweet
and
syrupy
for
my
liking
after
a
while
not
in
the
top
class
of
doppelbocks
but
pretty
good
d
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
bocks
but
this
one
was
fairly
good
i
had
no
problem
taking
this
one
down
so
id
have
to
say
it
has
high
drinkability
delicious
beer
would
love
to
have
a
case
of
this
taste
is
quite
malty
and
pretty
sweet
again
kind
of
boozy
but
its
got
a
good
taste
to
cover
most
of
it
up
overall
pretty
good
but
not
amazing
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
a
one
moderate
head
that
quickly
faded
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
lightly
malty
the
taste
was
maple
syrup
sweet
the
feel
was
barely
medium
bodied
with
little
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
pretty
good
but
not
that
close
to
the
best
in
class
overall
first
double
bock
that
ive
encountered
and
boy
was
it
interesting
it
was
good
to
the
last
dopple
drinkability
it
goes
down
quick
and
easily
by
the
looks
of
it
you
would
not
expect
this
you
dont
even
really
notice
the
high
abv
till
later
on
i
will
buy
this
again
for
sure
easy
and
fun
to
drink
this
beer
has
an
amazing
brown
town
hue
the
smell
was
not
to
my
standards
at
all
at
bit
funky
in
my
book
the
taste
is
very
unique
and
differnt
upon
other
beers
i
have
sampled
points
for
orignality
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
even
though
lotta
alchol
drinkable
nonetheless
and
yours
truly
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
goes
down
extremely
smooth
with
a
mediumlow
level
of
carbonation
extremely
drinkable
especially
for
an
8
2
doppelbock
pretty
carbonated
but
feels
relatively
light
for
a
doppel
but
the
high
abv
does
show
its
form
moreys
bottom
line
im
a
hophead
so
this
is
a
little
out
of
the
norm
for
me
that
said
this
is
one
good
beer
full
of
flavor
and
very
smooth
for
being
8
2
percent
alcohol
d
lots
of
flavour
and
fairly
drinkable
obviously
not
for
sessioning
but
good
for
every
now
and
then
d
frankly
i
love
this
beer
it
is
not
overly
complex
and
the
balanced
blend
of
flavors
culminate
in
a
very
enjoyable
beer
tasters
note
many
thanks
to
deuane
for
this
fine
pa
brew
d
moderate
high
etoh
content
keeps
it
from
being
a
session
beer
fine
brew
md
very
full
and
extremely
smooth
body
yet
remarkably
drinkable
hiding
the
8
2
abv
very
well
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
head
to
it
the
smell
is
of
deep
and
strong
roasted
malt
with
a
slight
hint
of
cherry
to
it
there
is
also
caramel
notes
to
it
as
well
the
taste
is
big
and
flavorful
there
is
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
with
caramel
the
malt
is
very
big
and
bold
there
is
a
hint
of
cherry
and
fruity
hops
to
slightly
balance
out
the
total
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
to
light
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
solid
beer
big
malt
taste
that
could
put
off
some
d
enjoyable
beer
that
no
one
should
have
much
trouble
finishing
most
likely
will
enjoy
another
one
of
these
pours
a
clear
dark
copperyred
with
a
fairly
thick
but
not
persistent
offwhite
head
aroma
is
malty
and
subtly
yeasty
but
not
strong
inviting
nonetheless
flavor
is
better
than
the
aroma
suggested
strong
malty
mouthfilling
with
hints
of
hops
and
caramel
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
just
a
little
tingly
leaving
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
d
suprinsingly
excellent
doppelbock
definitely
prefered
this
to
recent
tastings
in
the
style
of
sam
adams
but
maybe
not
quite
as
authentic
compared
to
some
germans
that
can
be
good
because
some
german
beers
taste
too
clean
for
my
tatstes
as
far
as
craft
beers
are
concerned
this
is
a
special
effort
an
easy
step
for
new
beer
enthusiasts
to
takethis
beer
is
not
overwhelming
and
has
little
deficiencies
perhaps
not
my
kind
of
session
beer
but
an
ideal
beer
to
drink
while
cooking
dinner
or
sharing
with
a
friend
prototypical
double
bock
overall
this
is
a
really
good
example
of
a
german
doppelbock
from
an
american
brewery
it
is
not
quite
celebrator
but
very
good
an
a
worthy
competitor
drink
great
for
a
doppelbock
drink
up
d
a
nice
relaxing
beer
that
is
best
enjoyed
slowly
definitely
one
to
be
savored
this
brew
is
drinkable
a
brew
to
be
careful
with
a
nice
party
starter
but
a
brew
that
will
knock
you
out
if
your
not
careful
d
quite
high
for
the
abv

great
for

widely
the

about

trails
off
at

however
has
the
tact
to
do
so
cleanly
really
a
perfect
american
style
german
doppelbock
its
a
bit
hop
heavy
compared
to
german
styles
but
overall
very
nice
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
love
the
maltyness
of
it
the
abv
can
sneak
up
on
you
if
you
are
not
careful
the
troegenator
im
drinking
right
now
is
over
a
year
old
so
it
has
picked
up
a
bit
of
a
boozy
taste
ive
gone
through
a
few
cases
in
the
past
for
a
while
it
was
one
of
my
session
beers
i
wish
i
had
the
troegs
drinking
horn
to
use
with
one
of
these
fine
beers
notes
this
a
great
beer
the
robustness
of
it
is
so
wonderful
for
a
cool
night
even
better
for
a
cold
winter
night
cheers
as
i
poured
this
beer
into
the
glass
i
was
a
bit
suprised
by
how
dark
amber
the
color
was
the
aroma
was
fairly
light
an
malty
as
was
the
mouthfeel
the
mouthfeel
was
especially
light
for
and
8
2
avb
beer
in
my
opinion
you
can
taste
the
roasted
malt
from
the
first
but
it
gets
stronger
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
which
yeilds
a
nice
alcohol
warmth
troegenator
is
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
its
a
very
drinkable
double
bock
and
a
solid
one
all
together
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
moderate
carbonation
not
bad
at
all
this
adds
up
to
a
pretty
drinkable
product
no
nugget
nectar
but
not
shabby
at
all
drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
may
be
the
best
ive
had
from
troegs
its
nice
a
little
heavy
but
very
sweet
so
its
going
great
as
my
desert
right
now
medium
body
with
lower
carbonation
so
smooth
and
almost
too
drinkable
for
the
size
very
well
made
drinkability
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
and
an
enjoyable
drink
however
i
just
really
didnt
fall
in
love
with
it
and
feel
that
one
is
really
enough
for
the
night
d
though
the
abv
is
not
overwhelming
the
mouthfeel
is
inhibiting
my
ability
to
drink
too
many
of
these
troegenator
is
a
special
beer
and
an
outstanding
example
of
doppelbock
drinkability
a
good
filling
beer
not
an
overly
complex
but
a
beer
strong
in
its
simplicity
a
good
warmer
winter
beer
no
doubt
i
would
wager
it
would
also
be
good
with
meat
and
potatoes
type
food
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
shaker
pint
glass
appears
a
clear
crimsonbrown
color
with
about
a
finger
of
light
ecru
foam
nose
and
flavor
is
of
sweet
and
toasted
grains
caramelized
malts
chocolate
a
touch
of
molasses
sweet
fruitiness
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
another
dose
of
sweet
malts
about
a
notch
better
than
medium
in
body
with
ample
carbonation
for
its
style
high
drinkability
despite
the
abv
troegenator
is
a
pretty
impressive
doppelbock
in
all
respects
theres
more
than
an
ample
amount
of
flavor
here
and
there
arent
any
big
missteps
along
the
way
its
not
a
huge
standout
in
terms
of
flavor
but
it
is
a
very
well
assembled
beer
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
troegs
has
made
better
and
worse
but
this
ones
pretty
damn
far
above
average
and
is
definitely
worth
checking
out
final
thoughts
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
im
a
mostly
dark
beer
drinker
and
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
the
pretty
mellow
taste
is
enjoyable
and
not
over
powered
by
the
alcohol
definitly
worth
a
try
the
abv
is
on
the
high
side
and
this
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
but
its
definitely
drinkable
pours
a
deep
brownish
red
color
with
minimal
head
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
head
and
this
being
the
last
in
my
sixer
i
have
learned
that
you
need
to
pour
vigorously
to
get
much
of
one
smells
slightly
of
some
burnt
surgars
and
molasses
its
a
smooth
crisp
beer
that
hides
the
abv
well
tastes
great
with
notes
of
molasses
and
dark
sugars
balanced
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
to
finish
things
out
i
never
would
guess
this
as
an
8
2
abv
and
could
easily
polish
a
couple
off
this
is
a
solid
beer
especially
for
the
price
smooth
and
drinkable
ive
never
had
a
bad
beer
from
this
brewery
keep
it
up
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
bock
style
but
this
one
was
much
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
i
would
recommend
it
if
your
looking
for
a
nice
american
rendition
of
the
style
full
body
with
medium
carbonation
creates
a
nice
creamy
texture
very
drinkable
for
a
dopp
lacks
the
depth
of
the
best
german
brewed
examples
but
is
one
of
the
better
american
versions
this
one
hides
its
abv
well
so
be
warned
d
i
must
admit
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
dbs
and
it
doesnt
dissapoint
on
tap
w
an
all
around
great
drinkability
for
such
a
big
beer
very
spicy
for
the
style
but
suits
me
fine
and
went
well
with
my
chipotle
chicken
pita
and
sweet
potato
fries
d
for
a
high
abv
brew
this
goes
down
easy
and
gives
no
hint
of
its
8
2
alcohol
content
a
very
well
balanced
doppelbock
not
too
malty
sweet
but
all
the
definitive
flavor
and
then
some
will
have
to
pick
up
a
6
pack
of
this
in
the
future
this
is
fairly
drinkable
but
the
high
abv
may
get
in
the
way
final
thoughts
compared
to
the
tap
the
bottled
version
holds
up
still
the
only
tröegs
i
have
had
well
worth
a
try
i
still
respect
bocks
and
dbs
but
this
just
isnt
my
favorite
style
still
a
highly
recommended
bottling
and
all
should
try
this
medium
body
starts
smooth
but
the
otherwise
moderate
carbonation
accentuates
the
phenols
and
gives
a
slight
overly
astringent
character
d
it
opens
up
well
as
it
warms
up
a
relatively
prototypical
doppelbock
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
sam
adams
boston
glass
the
beer
pours
a
dark
redamber
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
is
average
lacing
is
good
it
smells
like
caramel
malt
toffee
and
some
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
its
a
nice
aroma
however
it
is
a
bit
weak
luckily
the
taste
is
stronger
than
the
aroma
i
can
taste
caramel
malt
dark
fruit
breadgrain
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
it
has
moderate
carbonation
and
its
creamy
smooth
and
a
bit
slick
drinkability
is
very
good
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
other
than
the
light
aroma
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
brew
id
buy
it
again
the
taste
is
quite
boozy
there
are
definite
sweet
malts
lots
of
caramelized
malts
crystal
malts
and
some
rum
soaked
fruit
flavors
the
beer
is
strong
and
the
abv
is
coming
through
pretty
loud
and
clear
the
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
but
it
has
a
slight
but
noticeable
throaty
burn
from
the
abv
the
nose
eventually
emerges
on
this
beer
and
it
really
is
floral
the
sweeter
raisin
and
fig
tastes
come
out
a
bit
as
the
beer
settles
but
the
abv
is
more
than
i
bargained
for
its
all
okay
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
i
will
account
for
that
in
my
ratings
but
im
still
not
overly
impressed
nice
example
of
a
doppelboch
or
double
bock
from
an
awesome
brewery
all
in
all
a
good
doublebock
but
i
think
i
like
tommyknockers
butthead
a
little
better
give
this
a
shot
though
drinkability
well
the
taste
is
alright
but
not
exactly
what
i
expected
from
a
doppelbock
as
someone
who
used
to
drink
the
optimator
like
it
was
job
i
thought
it
would
be
more
like
that
also
i
think
its
a
little
sweet
and
i
hate
that
in
beers
either
way
glad
to
try
but
definitely
not
one
of
troegs
better
brews
thanks
adam
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
troegs
especially
if
youre
a
big
dopplebockheavy
beer
fan
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
double
bocks
that
is
made
in
the
usa
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
got
my
friends
to
drink
this
and
they
liked
it
all
they
every
drink
is
miller
light
of
crap
like
that
i
think
yuengling
should
have
sampled
this
bock
before
they
made
theres
dark
amber
colored
beer
with
slowly
fading
head
aroma
is
dark
fruit
taste
is
butterscotchcaramelbread
and
a
tweek
of
alcohol
a
very
good
solid
choice
smoothcreamy
and
tasty
i
never
had
this
before
and
was
taking
a
chance
buying
a
casebut
in
the
end
its
worth
it
recommended
very
easy
to
drink
wouldnt
mind
more
d
hardest
troegs
beer
i
have
had
to
finish
i
would
not
pass
it
up
if
handed
to
me
but
i
will
not
be
ordering
anytime
soon
onwards
and
upwards
back
to
their
hoppy
stuff
i
expected
so
much
from
this
beer
from
the
other
troegs
beers
i
have
had
and
the
appearance
when
first
poured
it
went
downhill
after
that
when
i
think
of
doublebock
i
think
of
a
rich
malty
strong
beer
with
a
robust
flavor
this
is
only
malty
and
none
of
the
rest
overall
a
ok
beer
d
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
half
of
this
bottle
the
alcohol
wasnt
overwhelming
or
anything
but
this
usual
type
of
taste
isnt
the
kind
of
thing
i
want
to
be
sipping
on
all
evening
m
medium
bodied
for
the
style
mild
carbonation
level
very
smooth
almost
creamy
very
well
balanced
palate
second
beer
ive
tried
from
this
brewery
and
they
continue
to
impress
me
this
might
not
be
as
good
as
the
best
german
doppelbocks
but
its
not
far
behind
d
not
my
favorite
beer
or
style
but
certainly
worth
one
or
two
d
not
my
favorite
style
but
pretty
damn
tasty
cheers
shawn
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
over
all
i
would
drink
this
again
thanks
for
picking
this
up
sstacko
this
beer
pours
a
clear
beautiful
ruby
red
almost
mahogany
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
head
is
and
off
white
almost
tan
frothy
color
about
a
finger
thick
head
retentions
is
decent
nice
lacing
throughout
the
nose
is
marked
with
notes
of
cherries
raspberries
caramelized
malt
and
a
touch
of
breadiness
the
taste
is
of
almost
caramelized
cherries
hints
of
raspberry
touch
of
honey
and
malts
and
a
bit
bready
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
very
sweet
though
with
a
sweet
yet
bitter
aftertaste
to
it
this
is
a
very
drinkleable
beer
overall
a
very
solid
doppelbock
not
quite
as
complex
perhaps
as
celebrator
but
very
clean
and
smooth
especially
for
the
high
abv
i
could
drink
many
of
these
another
solid
beer
from
a
local
statewise
brewery
i
like
the
style
like
the
beer
like
the
brewery
nothing
bad
to
say
brew
poured
to
a
nice
deep
amber
color
with
red
and
copper
highlights
has
a
nice
fluffy
two
finger
head
that
has
very
good
retention
and
left
chunks
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
and
roasted
malts
has
caramel
and
a
nuttiness
within
these
properties
as
well
the
flavor
does
not
come
across
as
sweat
as
one
would
expect
based
on
the
nose
more
of
a
roasted
taste
has
a
chocolate
flavor
tat
is
a
little
more
dry
than
sweet
some
fruit
flavors
are
mixed
in
nicely
the
end
has
a
slight
bitterness
to
it
that
at
times
seems
to
go
well
with
this
brew
and
on
other
sips
seems
to
take
a
little
emphasize
the
little
bit
away
from
this
brew
as
this
brew
warms
the
alcohol
comes
out
a
little
more
in
the
tail
end
of
a
sip
this
is
a
nice
sipping
brew
which
i
will
milk
for
a
while
as
i
listen
to
the
phish
concert
from
march
6th
something
about
listening
to
phish
and
drinking
a
nice
brew
nice
ending
to
the
day
i
kept
trying
to
pull
out
more
flavors
throughout
the
session
but
despite
my
effort
and
concentration
this
is
just
a
beer
that
lacks
character
not
bad
by
any
means
but
i
was
expecting
much
more
its
drinkable
enough
just
not
very
exciting
im
probably
a
little
bias
because
i
really
dig
a
nice
doppelbock
in
early
spring
but
this
brew
truly
delivered
great
interpretation
of
this
style
of
beer
mighty
smooth
and
drinkable
at
8
2
abv
d
the
drinkability
is
there
because
its
a
troegs
beer
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
taste
is
similarly
flat
hoppy
bitterness
but
little
balance
or
fullfillment
as
a
newcomer
to
doublebocks
it
might
be
this
particular
beer
or
the
style
which
i
am
not
a
fan
of
either
way
too
strong
for
my
taste
buds
drinkability
i
really
like
this
dopplebock
it
is
on
the
sweeter
side
for
the
style
but
a
very
good
version
for
the
style
it
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
i
would
have
this
again
a
very
solid
beer
by
a
very
solid
brewery
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
possibly
the
most
drinkable
doppelbock
i
have
yet
to
try
a
nice
doppelbock
not
as
heavy
as
others
and
easy
to
drink
even
during
the
warmer
weather
another
troegs
winner
if
not
for
the
high
abv
a
sure
session
pleaser
easy
to
drink
with
a
well
balanced
palate
a
very
drinkable
bock
because
i
would
describe
it
as
wellbalanced
being
somewhat
true
to
the
style
i
probably
should
have
rated
it
higher
i
rate
most
things
really
high
but
i
dont
want
to
buy
this
again
d
i
usually
drink
my
troegs
right
up
but
i
took
my
time
with
this
one
while
i
enjoyed
it
i
was
not
so
eager
to
finish
it
the
abv
is
not
the
problem
its
probably
the
aftertaste
all
and
all
i
enjoyed
this
ive
had
plenty
of
brews
that
showed
more
alcohol
at
5
than
this
does
at
8
2
really
a
solid
brew
here
just
doesnt
have
anything
that
jumps
out
at
me
to
put
it
over
the
top
i
could
really
drink
a
lot
of
this
if
given
the
chance
good
all
around
doppelbock
in
my
opinion
drinkability
i
would
and
did
drink
another
one
after
my
wife
drank
half
of
the
first
one
i
would
and
did
purchase
another
one
as
well
im
not
over
the
moon
about
this
but
good
dbock
for
the
price
a
solid
bock
but
for
the
money
smuttonator
is
a
better
call
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
and
slightly
carbonated
the
finish
is
light
and
doesnt
linger
for
long
this
doppelbock
is
a
bit
thin
and
doesnt
have
the
rich
malty
flavor
as
really
good
beer
have
it
is
just
an
okay
beer
not
great
but
okay
taste
is
mucho
sugary
and
thick
not
neccesarily
in
a
bad
way
it
still
tastes
pretty
good
a
slight
vegetal
flavor
creeps
in
in
the
middle
followed
by
a
toasty
and
mild
hop
bitterness
overall
one
of
the
better
american
dbocks
out
there
looking
forward
to
some
more
troegs
this
is
a
pretty
great
beer
overall
sweet
and
bitter
meet
up
in
a
nice
little
package
a
good
beer
for
any
time
and
would
probably
please
most
all
types
of
palates
purchased
a
bomber
at
bauer
for
4
99
poured
into
a
rapscallion
snifter
ruby
amber
color
very
thin
head
that
was
gone
in
no
time
wonderful
smell
i
got
a
distinct
hint
of
cherry
juice
with
the
first
sniff
taste
was
pretty
malty
but
it
didnt
overpower
me
while
this
is
a
decent
double
bock
it
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
my
main
problem
was
how
thin
it
was
wheres
the
body
while
it
had
a
really
nice
taste
and
the
over
8
abv
was
not
really
noticeable
this
beer
just
didnt
grab
me
this
is
the
first
troegs
ive
bought
so
ill
expect
a
bit
more
next
time
pours
a
rich
caramel
with
good
initial
head
presence
that
last
sin
the
lacing
process
smell
is
a
deep
malt
with
molasses
notes
taste
is
deep
and
rich
in
malt
and
molasses
with
a
hint
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
rich
and
deep
drinkability
is
excellent
considering
the
abv
it
is
smooth
and
silky
unusual
for
an
extreme
brew

fades
cleanly
i
think
this
could
use
some
more
fruits
to
fit
with
the
style
a
well
made
brew
of
a
version
that
in
my
experience
is
either
very
good
or
poor
with
not
much
in
the
middle
this
definetely
falls
into
the
good
my
first
from
troegs
and
will
be
seeking
out
more
smelled
super
malty
a
maltbomb
with
a
hint
of
sweentness
in
the
smell
i
expected
just
a
thick
gooy
disaster
that
i
would
detest
from
this
smell
but
the
taste
was
actually
pretty
light
and
refreshing
it
was
malty
sure
but
it
didnt
offend
my
precious
hop
slanted
palate
one
bit
i
saw
one
guy
refer
to
this
as
a
gateway
doppelbock
and
if
that
is
true
then
this
beer
achieved
its
goal
admirably
it
has
always
been
a
style
that
just
hasnt
done
much
for
me
but
troegs
has
caused
me
to
take
pause
not
my
favorite
beer
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
certainly
seek
it
out
again
in
the
future
when
i
want
a
break
from
hopladen
nectar
surprisingly
balanced
for
such
a
malty
style
medium
bodied
not
as
silky
as
it
could
be
medlow
carbonation
quite
good
i
just
generally
want
more
than
this
from
the
style
d
for
a
doppelbock
this
is
greatly
drinkable
the
sweetness
is
very
mild
the
heartiness
of
this
beer
is
amazing
this
doesnt
have
the
sweetness
that
most
doppelbocks
have
instead
it
is
more
like
a
meal
with
all
the
bread
and
fruit
coming
through
i
am
going
to
have
no
problem
putting
this
bomber
down
and
i
can
probably
put
down
another
if
i
had
it
overall
a
good
to
great
doppelbock
that
is
well
done
and
damned
tasty

fairly

i
just
dont
think
this
is
my
style
notes
paired
very
well
with
a
packet
of
williamssonoma
dry
tuscan

mix
that
i
beefed
up

first
in

flavor
plenty
of
nut
slightly
herbal
hops
in
the
background
and
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
warmth
though
it
does
not
taste
like
an
8
2
beer
toward
the
fuller
side
of
body
with
moderate
carbonation
not
viscous
like
some
dopplebocks
makes
this
one
more
refreshing
and
drinkable
than
expected
all
around
one
of
the
best
dopplebocks
i
have
ever
had
wellbalanced
drinkable
pretty
no
complaints
here
glad
i
can
get
this
in
tyngsborro
a
solid
offering
troegs
seems
to
not
always
just
hit
style
guidelines
with
pinpoint
accuracy
but
also
land
right
on
the
mark
with
regards
to
quality
as
well
these
are
the
two
areas
where
ive
found
the
most
consistency
with
this
brewery
oh
and
if
you
count
my
tremendously
enjoying
their
beers
that
makes
a
third
category
theyve
excelled
at
as
well
a
decent
beer
not
the
best
ive
had
from
troegsnugget
nectar
and
mad
elf
are
definitely
better
imo
still
there
arent
a
ton
of
good
american
doppelbocks
out
there
so
im
glad
to
have
a
chance
to
have
tried
this
one
sweet
but
not
overbearingly
so
it
just
has
a
medicinal
quality
i
cant
get
past
similar
to
mad
elf
with
that
one
respect
except
in
the
case
of
mad
elf
it
endeared
me
to
the
beer
a
little
fruity
but
the
cherry
notes
just
kind
of
slide
into
the
background
actually
a
little
dry
side
to
the
finish
that
i
wasnt
anticipating
mouthfeel
is
good
does
well
to
keep
things
feeling
fresh
part
of
that
medicinal
quality
comes
back
in
a
funky
aftertaste
at
the
end
not
bad
per
se
but
im
not
warming
up
to
it
either
i
tried
not
to
let
my
expectations
temper
my
review
but
i
think
the
fact
that
i
was
expecting
something
bigger
leads
me
to
a
bit
of
disappointment
its
not
a
bad
american
representation
for
the
style
it
just
could
use
some
work
if
it
had
less
of
a
medicinal
syrupiness
and
kick
to
it
that
would
help
a
great
deal
d
no
trace
of
alcohol
endlessly
sippable
delicious
doppelbock
the
only
real
drawback
is
the
metallic
twang
in
the
nose
otherwise
this
is
a
fine
beer
still
i
liked
penn
st
nicholaus
more
d
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
is
nothing
compared
to
celebrator
but
it
definitely
holds
its
ground
and
is
very
drinkable
this
beer
drinks
like
a
5
rather
than
an
imperial
lager
another
great
job
done
by
troegs
doppelbocks
are
usually
a
little
heavy
inherently
maybe
this
one
doesnt
have
the
sweet
spice
that
those
stellar
traditional
german
examples
offer
up
but
its
solid
as
hell
and
even
better

with
lingering
sweetness
pretty
easy
to
drink
considering
the
abv
nice
for
a
cold
winters
night
d
my
first
double
bock
overall
very
nice
brew
pretty
complex
very
flavorful
and
enjoyable
is
this
a
true
dobbelbock
it
almost
feels
like
more
of
a
barleywine
seems
to
be
missing
the
classic
troegs
hops
flavor
i
find
in
most
of
their
lineup
not
a
bad
thing
given
the
style

great

nice

good
stuff
love
this
beer
and
need
to
find
it
on
tap
thankfuly
its
coming
to
massachusetts
this
month
d
very
smooth
and
drinkable
can
definitely
see
drinking
this
one
over
and
over
again
notes
thats
2
for
3
for
troegs
for
me
as
their
mad
elf
was
one
of
my
favorite
seasonals
last
year
and
their
hop
back
amber
was
a
nice
surprise
this
one
was
not
to
my
liking
drinkability
this
is
a
fairly
rich
beer
and
one
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
many
of
in
one
evening
notes
i
dont
mind
creativity
and
originality
in
beer
making
i
think
they
are
wonderful
but
i
do
get
frustrated
seeing
some
american
craft
brewers
claiming
their
beer
is
in
a
certain
style
while
producing
something
completely
outside
of
that
style
troegenator
does
not
fall
into
this
category
it
is
a
solid
sweet
liquid
bread
which
does
exactly
what
you
would
expect
a
dopplebock
to
do
d
a
nice
dopplebock
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
if
you
enjoy
nice
malts
and
yeasts
this
is
worth
trying
md
medium
to
full
bodied
with
very
crisp
carbonation
a
touch
overcarbonated
for
the
style
still
rather
easy
drinking
it
pours
a
dark
amber
color
and
gives
off
a
slight
sweet
vanilla
aroma
there
is
little
head
retention
but
then
this
is
a
style
where
one
is
not
needed
there
is
an
upfront
sweet
malty
taste
followed
by
a
small
hop
presence
in
the
after
taste
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
and
it
is
well
balanced
the
phenol
notes
are
not
noticeable
which
is
great
considering
the
high
alcohol
content
wow
excellent
im
from
the
harrisburg
pa
area
yet
as
a
beer
newbie
i
havent
gotten
to
try
this
before
the
only
other
troegs
beer
i
have
tried
in
the
past
is
mad
elf
last
year
im
only
23
and
have
never
tried
a
dopplebock
before
anyway
opened
the
beer
from
a
six
pack
hit
with
a
nice
soft
scent
from
it
not
what
i
was
expecting
poured
into
a
standard
glass
a
dark
amber
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
reminded
me
of
a
port
wine
and
minimal
lacing
one
interesting
note
is
that
it
left
large
bubbles
in
the
bottle
something
ive
never
seen
before
smell
was
of
the
malted
barley
up
front
followed
by
a
lingering
scent
of
the
hops
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
was
just
as
the
smell
sweet
malt
followed
by
slight
bitter
of
hops
and
warmth
of
the
alcohol
down
the
back
of
the
throat
it
surprised
me
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
everything
is
layered
together
but
in
a
great
way
one
does
have
to
worry
about
the
8
2
alcohol
level
it
can
sneak
up
on
you
excellent
beer
wonderful
for
a
nightcap
or
just
a
winter
warmer
this
beer
was
thick
and
toasty
like
a
traditional
dopplebock
but
the
weight
gets
in
the
way
you
can
almost
see
the
high
alcohol
content
in
the
beer
and
definitely
taste
it
the
beer
is
very
rich
and
flavorful
though
the
undisguised
alcohol
flavor
interferes
a
little
with
the
palette
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
poured
a
dark
reddish
color
with
an
off
white
heading
that
settles
quickly
looking
closley
into
the
glass
i
noticed
some
type
of
isomers
if
that
is
the
right
term
for
this
a
very
sweet
smell
of
caramel
and
some
fruits
again
a
very
sweet
taste
with
a
very
nice
aftertaste
left
no
lacing
not
a
cant
miss
but
if
you
see
it
give
it
a
shot
18
dark
head
on
pour
that
fadded
to
nothing
really
quick
dark
purple
opaque
body
thin
ring
of
lacing
barely
sweet
aroma
not
getting
a
lot
but
the
style
doesnt
isnt
usually
known
for
smells
great
sweet
malty
taste
though
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
on
the
tongue
but
otherwise
a
great
crafted
brew
balanced
some
grapes
in
the
flavor
too
thanks
to
jwale73
for
the
offering
overall
i
can
say
that
i
wish
i
would
have
tried
this
earlier
this
just
might
be
the
best
dopplebock
this
side
of
the
pond
im
a
total
ignoramus
when
it
comes
to
doppelbocks
thus
my
conservative
scoring
i
wanted
to
try
sixpoints
emasculator
when
it
came
around
but
missed
that
bus
so
this
is
my
first
it
reminded
me
a
great
deal
of
long
trails
triple
bag
anyway
if
troegs
is
anywhere
close
to
the
germans
on
this
im
looking
forward
to
my
next
foray
in
this
style
even
with
some
flaws
in
my
book
this
is
still
one
of
the
best
american
doppelbock
i
have
tried
very
drinkable
i
finished
the
bomber
with
no
problems
at
all
and
was
left
wanting
for
more
good
job
tröegs
you
havent
disappointed
me
yet
my
scores
maybe
low
in
a
couple
areas
but
i
am
comparing
it
to
imports
of
this
style
a
light
mahogony
color
with
touches
of
amber
a
ligth
beige
colored
head
forms
on
top
about
a
quater
inch
high
but
dissolves
away
quickly
the
sweet
scent
of
malt
is
very
dominant
with
another
scent
of
dark
bread
at
the
end
of
each
scent
the
malt
comes
right
out
at
the
front
along
with
a
breadiness
that
dominates
the
taste
for
almost
the
entire
flavor
then
at
the
end
a
mild
grassy
bitterness
comes
through
and
lingers
there
for
some
time
there
is
hearty
chewiness
in
the
feel
though
still
leaving
that
crisp
finish
you
find
in
the
lager
the
dopplebock
is
a
hard
beer
to
brew
and
this
is
a
great
dopplebock
the
great
maltiness
and
heartiness
that
one
expects
from
this
style
are
the
strengths
of
this
beer
d
nice
drinkability
with
very
good
flavor
and
enjoyment
that
wont
disappoint
subtle
flavors
become
more
pronounced
as
troegenator
warms
at
first
a
thinneddown
caramel
malt
presence
is
all
that
can
be
detected
but
soon
a
spicy
rum
and
raisin
sweetness
wash
over
the
palate
finishes
with
a
nutty
hint
and
a
boozy
warmth
the
mouthfeel
is
accentuated
by
a
carbonation
level
that
complements
the
spices
well
and
the
mediumthick
body
achieves
a
nearcreamy
consistency
overall
a
solid
offering
from
a
brewery
that
has
yet
to
let
me
down
id
easily
pick
this
up
again

a
very
solid
brew
very
solid
dopplebock
in
my
opinion
the
aroma
is
lacking
compared
to
others
of
this
style
but
its
a
very
smooth
and
tasty
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
lighter
than
usual
for
a
dopplebock
with
a
foamy
fizzy
head
and
lots
of
visible
carbonation
aroma
is
both
floral
and
of
charcoal
along
with
some
cane
sugar
taste
is
a
sodalike
dopplebock
with
a
lot
of
fruityness
and
light
raisin
notes
seems
pretty
thin
for
a
dopplebock
and
overly
processed
for
a
beer
more
like
they
mixed
together
dopplebock
syrup
with
water
and
carbonated
it
not
altogether
terrible
but
this
definitely
doesnt
remind
me
of
the
amazing
brewing
of
german
beers
youd
find
in
ayinger
celebrator
or
spaten
optimator
another
great
treat
from
troegs
i
am
very
glad
to
have
tried
it
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
i
like
most
of
what
troegs
does
and
this
is
no
exception
i
would
have
liked
to
pick
up
a
few
of
these
when
back
east
but
unfortunately
didnt
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
d
very
good

really
liked
this

it
wasnt
overly

as
some
doppelbocks
can
be

still
had
a
nice

flavor
making
the
beer
very

with
a
small

lots
of

in

with

much
like
a
doppelbock
should
be
very
light
amount
of
carbonation
with
helps
the
delicious
malts
seep
through
very
good
example
of
a
doppelbock
this
looked
and
smelled
wonderful
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
just
werent
there
i
felt
so
anyway
it
poured
the
caramel

colour
of
100s
of
other
doppelbocks
with
a
big
fluffly
sand
coloured
head
lots
of
sticky

it
looked
nice
the
smell
was
quite
lovely
as
well
plenty
of
sweet
roasted
malts
some
brown
sugar
heavy
maple
presence
i
was
quite
excited
at
this
point
taste
had
sweet
malts
and
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
but
quite
honestly
it
was
very
dull
and
empty
lifeless
and
unexciting
hohum
mouthfeel
was
very
thing
for
the
style
i
thought
my
overall
opinion
of
the
beer
was
very
average
and
boring
the
third
beer
in
the
lineup
at
a
doppelbock
tasting
with
the
three
bas

sweet

not
what

is

kudos
for
that
not
a

from

with
some
of
the
other
doppels
we
drank
that
day
drinkability
good
solid
with
in
the
style
and
easy
to
put
away
the
first
time
i
had
this
it
seemed
very
bitter
with
too
much
cocoa
while
this
time
the
diacetyl
notes
were
a
little
distracting
good
for
a
regularly
available
beer
but
a
little
thin
and
underdeveloped
for
the
style
drinkability
fine
for
the
style
pours
dark
amber
to
brown
in
color
with
a
very
small
amount
of
off
white
head
that
fades
quickly
aroma
is
a
very
nice
big
malty
sweetness
like
cooking
up
a
rich
wort
there
are
also
a
nice
aroma
of
dried
fruits
prunes
raisins
and
strawberries
taste
follows
with
big
rich
sweet
maltiness
and
prunes
light
to
medium
in

there
is
a
little

on
the
palette
with

a

a
real
enjoyable
doppelbock
one
id
have
no
problem
returning
to
again
fairly
highly
carbonated
a
little
sticky
but
still
nice
fairly
drinkable
but
the
lack
of
integration
would
begin
to
bother
me
another
great
brew
sent
by
beerbeing
hes
the
brew
man
drinkability
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
a
little
too
strong
though
costing
it
a
bit
a
nice
interpretation
on
the
style
poured
into
a
flute
glass
a
cherry
maple
color
kind
of
looks
like
a
lite
coffee
thin
beige
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
a
thin
rim
of
lace
smells
of
caramel
and
burnt
toast
taste
wise
this
is
a
malt
bomb
and
a
very
delicious
one
at
that
caramel
up
front
bready
with
a
very
nice
toast
finish
long
lasting
toast
aftertaste
thick
and
chewy
in
the
mouth
very
drinkable
for
8
the
alcohol
is
hardly
noticable
i
havent
had
many
dopplebocks
but
if
they
taste
like
this
i
am
going
to
explore
them
further
this
beer
poured
a
semicloudy
burnt
orange
there
was
little
head
the
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
the
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
nice
fruity
aftertaste
the
fruit
taste
is
similar
to
pears
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
there
is
little
indication
of
the
higher
abv
i
could
drink
this
beer
again
one
of
the
better
beers
of
the
style
i
have
had
glowing
mahoganny
colored
beer
sits
all
by
itself
because
i
never
got
much
of
head
out
of
this
one
malty
sweet
flavor
with
a
mild
nuttyness
that
picks
up
towards
the
finish
smells
a
bit
like
caramel
mixed
with
grapes
fairly
thick
beer
with
just
a
touch
of
carbonation
i
wasnt
expecting
a
lot
of
carbonation
but
a
little
would
be
nice
in
both
the
mouthfeel
and
maybe
put
the
rest
towards
a
14
of
head
big
malt
beer
that
is
pretty
good
but
after
6
beers
over
the
last
week
it
never
really
excited
me
d
rich
tasty
highly
drinkable
brew
with
a
firm
alcohol
presence
sweet
tasting
full
flavored
highly
highly
recommended
the
8
plus
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
flavor
but
does
warm
you
up
and
could
be
a
dangerous
one
if
you
had
a
sixer
of
this
prost
mk
pretty
good
doppelbock
and
the
hints
of
hops
make
it
just
a
bit
special
not
for
mass
consumption
but
for
a
glass
or
two
of
enjoyment
every
now
and
then
overall
a
very
nice
beer
and
an
above
average
doppelbock
imho
very
tasty
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
good
frankly
its
a
fine
brew
and
one
that
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
more
regularly
but
it
just
isnt
near
the
level
of
some
of
the
other
fine
doppelbocks
out
there
this
one
is
definitely
best
savored
a
bit
on
the
warm
side
so
much
of
its
identity
is
obscured
fresh
from
the
fridge
so
let
this
one
warm
up
a
little
for
sure
d
i
never
get
tired
of
this
one
troegs
has
a
gem
in
troegenator
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
perfect
with
so
many
foods
and
cheeses
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
i
routinely
come
back
to
enjoy
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
greatest
doppelbock
in
the
world
have
had
this
beer
many
times
before
but
only
in
bottles
and
this
time
it
was
from
a
growler
what
a
difference
i
loved
it
before
but
the
tastes
just
jump
out
this
time
the
biggest
difference
that
the
freshness
made
was
a
strong
nutty
flavor
present
in
the
beer
which
i
absolutely
loved
there
was
also
more
head
and
it
was
longer
lasting
other
than
those
things
it
was
pretty
similar
to
a
bottle
but
that
was
enough
to
impress
me
thoroughly
drinkability
this
is
not
the
best
doppelbock
in
the
world
but
i
think
would
come
through
in
a
pinch
if
youre
desperate
for
a
decent
doppelbock
its
too
bad
the
beer
wasnt
as
good
as
the
label
but
at
least
it
had
a
name
with
the
doppelbock
ator
suffix
at
the
end
d
the
flavor
of
this
beer
wasnt
too
bad
but
everything
else
about
it
kind
of
let
me
down
however
i
am
not
a
fan
of
dopplebocks
so
dont
take
my
word
for
it
nuff
said
definitely
not
one
of
my
favourite
doppelbocks
but
good
to
have
in
a
local
brewery
at
least
it
was
local
when
i
was
working
in
nj
d
decent
drinkability
thanks
to
maltygoodness
for
this
beer
definitely
get
malty
and
a
hint
of
caramel
with
this
basically
no
hops
finish
is
clean
but
fades
fast
mediumrich
body
with
the
alcohol
smoothly
coming
through
in
the
body
light
sweetness
but
not
much
i
had
a
friend
buy
a
case
of
this
a
little
while
ago
and
he
really
picked
out
a
good
one
gorgeous
red
amber
coloring
strong
sweet
malty
beer
the
alcohol
really
doesnt
overpower
the
caramel
slightly
fruity
flavoring
nice
on
a
colder
night
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
troegenator
double
bock
like
boston
beer
company
troegs
insists
on
using
the
anglicized
version
of
the
name
isnt
much
of
a
doppelbock
but
is
a
pretty
fair
maibock
worth
a
look
not
a
big
huge
example
of
the
style
but
a
pleasing
one
cheers
somewhat
of
a
strong
malt
aroma
light
brown
to
copper
in
color
very
clear
in
appearance
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slight
head
very
easy
going
down
no
bitterness
or
aftertaste
a
very
smooth
overall
mouthfeel
i
consider
this
a
good
tasting
beer
with
no
harsh
aftertaste
will
buy
this
again
overall
id
been
living
in
the
philly
area
for
two
years
when
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
this
one
its
exquisite
and
i
should
have
gotten
to
it
sooner
poured
a
rather
translucent
medium
brown
color
with
a
soft
white
colored
head
that
left
behind
just
a
touch
of
lacing
the
color
was
not
nearly
as
dark
as
i
had
expected
given
the
style
it
seemed
more
like
an
amber
ale
than
a
doppelbock
aromas
of
alcohol
and
grains
dominated
the
scent
i
really
couldnt
get
much
out
of
this
and
it
was
my
first
indication
this
beer
wasnt
what
i
had
hoped
it
would
be
the
taste
was
understated
to
say
the
least
with
a
very
subdued
malt
presence
the
beer
was
sweet
overall
but
it
didnt
taste
as
if
different
types
of
malt
had
been
used
though
im
sure
they
did
even
as
the
beer
warmed
i
couldnt
get
much
in
the
way
of
other
flavors
fruits
earthy
tones
etc
every
other
flavor
was
so
subtle
i
could
decipher
what
i
was
tasting
in
subsequent
sips
the
mouthfeel
was
just
as
average
as
the
taste
with
not
much
intensity
or
texture
the
beer
felt
rather
thin
in
my
mouth
as
if
it
had
been
watered
down
despite
these
apparent
flaws
i
love
this
style
of
beer
and
so
i
could
see
myself
having
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
especially
with
the
right
cuisine
makes
me
wish
it
was
colder
this
winter
d
i
can
put
a
couple
of
these
down
even
with
the
abv
very
interesting
beer
tastes
like
bread
crust
with
a
bit
of
a
bitter
bite
to
finish
pretty
good
balance
its
not
incredibly
smooth
i
can
definately
notice
carbonation
but
its
enjoyable
i
was
not
disappointed
like
the
oatmeal
stout
from
troegs
this
is
solid
very
available
here
and
i
will
certainly
be
sticking
a
6er
of
this
in
the
fridge
just
tasty
all
the
way
around
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
a
nice
in
between
option
if
you
are
in
the
mood
i
have
been
drinking
this
beer
for
a
while
now
a
very
worthy
beer
better
than
its
score
a
good
drinking
beer
its
taste
is
quite
malty
but
not
overbearing
perfect
for
this
style
of
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
little
or
no
head
but
has
a
decent
lacing
very
smooth
and
hasd
a
pleasant
aftertaste
if
you
can
get
some
drink
it
nice
fluffy
head
that
sticks
around
coats
the
glass
and
fades
to
a
rocky
texture
the
color
is
a
crystal
clear
reddish
brown
and
the
head
is
tan
with
golden
highlights
the
aroma
is
fairly
clean
with
a
maltiness
that
is
a
little
soft
and
almost
fruity
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
sweet
maltiness
with
some
toasted
character
and
a
hint
of
toffee
and
almost
a
licorice
like
note
the
sweetness
is
stays
just
under
the
point
where
it
gets
to
be
too
much
the
hop
character
seems
to
show
up
only
at
the
end
as
bitterness
for
balance
there
is
a
slight
alcoholic
warming
that
is
appropriate
although
its
a
little
rough
none
of
these
characteristics
made
troegenator
a
bad
beer
but
it
was
much
too
far
off
the
mark
from
the
style
they
were
aiming
for
if
you
like
it
for
what
it
is
then
good
for
you
but
dont
look
at
this
as
a
prototypical
example
of
the
style
the

is
wellhidden
in
this
gem
and
id
love
to
try
it
with
braised

i
didnt
have
any

they
were

i

poured
it

senses
some
astringency
in

thin

this
is
a

beer

it

pours
a
nice
reddish
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
does
not
last
long
slight
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
of
complex
malts
and
possibly
some
noble
hops
the
taste
is
warming
with
a
presence
of
alcohol
that
lasts
in
your
stomach
and
throat
very
clean
taste
and
yet
a
syrupy
body
in
the
presence
hops
are
slightly
present
this
feels
and
tastes
like
a
good
dopplebock
the
aftertaste
is
very
malty
and
sits
well
on
a
cold
winter
night
nice
beer
and
i
think
it
fits
the
category
well
poured
a
deep
copperamber
color
with
a
thin
head
lightly
carbonated
compared
to
other
beers
but
nothing
to
worry
about
just
a
characteristic
of
this
particular
beer
very
sweet
malty
smell
with
hints
of
caramel
taste
mimicked
the
smell
was
a
bit
thin
on
the
mouth
but
very
refreshing
for
a
fairly
strong
beer
would
like
this
one
in
the
summer
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
though
and
it
tastes
alright
pretty
malty
with
a
mild
hop
finish
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
out
of
a
bottle
to
see
how
it
compares
and
this
beer
has
also
made
me
want
to
try
out
some
more
of
tröegs
offerings
its
basic
if
not
truly
remarkable
malty
goodness
nothing
here
shines
overly
brightly
but
all
shine
enough
to
be
notably
enjoyed
its
sturdy
and
reliable
like
a
good
trusty
pair
of
shoes
never
wearing
out
its
welcome
and
impressing
enough
not
to
be
forgotten
the
abv
has
some
backbone
but
is
not
crippling
and
rather
it
just
warms
nicely
this
is
one
very
pleasant
wellcrafted
interpretation
of
the
style
drinkability
is
decent
a
nice
regional
doppelbock
body
is
a
bit
thinnish
not
as
thick
as
i
expected
drinkability
is
really
good
though
nice
and
refreshing
and
easy
to
put
down
dangerously
drinkable
a
sweet
warming
beer
that
goes
well
with
dessert
not
an
incredible
head
but
very
well
carbonated
a
fruity
bread
like
aroma
with
hints
of
alcohol
and
a
dark
amber
color
smooth
malty
taste
that
leaves
your
entire
body
warm
while
the
carbonation
tickles
your
tongue
a
good
choice
for
those
cold
fall
or
winter
nights
and
despite
what
the
troegs
web
site
tells
you
goes
really
well
with

troegs

done
a
good
job

full
maltiness
here
that
is
characteristic
of
a
doppelbock
the
flavors
that
i
can
pick
up
remind
me
of
caramel
coated
biscuits
honey
vanilla
though
i
think
this
is
more
a
product
of
the
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
hint
of
fruit
notes
cherry
and
orange
perhaps
there
is
a
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
just
barely
tries
to
balance
the
rich
maltiness
that
dominates
this
brew
this
is
a
very
good
doppelbock
and
i
am
quite
enjoying
it
draught
this
one
poured
a
clear
dark
reddishcoppery
color
mine
had
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
there
was
some
sweet
caramel
malt
to
the
nose
the
aroma
also
contained
some
spicy
floral
notes
this
one
has
a
nice
sweet
caramel
malt
taste
with
some
hints
of
fruits
a
hint
of
bitterness
and
some
spicyness
in
the
aftertaste
very
nice
drinkability
goes
down
very
easy
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
doppelbocks
ive
had
drinkability
and
overall
its
been
some
time
since
i
last
had
this
beer
since
then
ive
had
many
more
doppelbocks
including
many
good
true
german
onces
and
this
beer
is
still
killer
quite
a
good
representation
of
the
style
without
having
that
normal
american
bock
flavor
pours
a
deep
amber
almost
red
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
with
moderate
carbonation
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
malt
with
hints
of
raspberry
caramel
vanilla
and
oak
the
taste
is
quite
malty
just
like
the
smell
and
you
get
just
the
faintest
hint
of
hopping
in
the
background
the
malt
flavor
is
not
overwhelming
and
is
quite
well
rounded
with
a
tart
fruit
flavor
raspberries
or
perhaps
strawberries
or
even
cherries
and
a
smooth
vanilla
flavor
as
well
as
a
molasses
sweetness
that
follows
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
and
bitter
but
that
makes
it
all
the
more
refreshing
i
havent
had
many
dopplebocks
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
and
it
hides
the
alcohol
fairly
well
not
an
excellent
beer
but
pretty
damn
good
and
it
seems
like
it
could
be
sessionable
despite
the
high
alcohol
pours
a
clear
reddish
brownrusty
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
settles
down
into
a
minimal
covering
fairly
active
carbination
aroma
is
of
carmel
a
little
vanilla
flavor
is
a
bready
maltiness
with
more
hints
of
caramel
and
vanilla
little
to
no
hops
present
in
the
flavor
this
is
not
a
brew
for
you
hopheads
out
there
sweetness
is
cut
by
a
hint
of
alcohol
but
its
well
hidden
for
a
beer
listed
at
8
2
abv
medium
body
texture
has
a
fairly
clean
slightly
bitter
finish
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
turned
me
into
a
doppel
lover
aroma
was
hidden
to
me
i
couldnt
pick
up
a
whole
lot
with
this
one
taste
was
a
malt
bomb
with
hints
of
candy
brown
sugar
chocolate
and
caramel
not
overly
sweet
at
all
which
leads
me
to
believe
there
is
some
balancing
hop
there
but
i
am
not
picking
it
up
in
the
flavor
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
its
slightly
chewy
and
fairly
medium
bodied
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
for
sure
i
would
buy
this
one
again
very
drinkable
well
hidden
abv
makes
it
easy
to
have
23
will
definitly
buy
again
another
beauty
to
behold
warm
cherry
amber
hue
with
a
clinging
cream
colored
12
head
of
loose
foam
nose
rang
of
light
yeast
but
hinted
at
the
richness
to
come
boy
is
this
nice
and
rich
full
of
mellow
malts
that
finished
like
it
started
rich
very
smooth
almost
creamy
and
full
of
rich
malts
a
very
enjoyable
and
highly
drinkable
brew
but
be
careful
of
that
high
abv
could
sneak
up
on
you
as
you
enjoy
this
there
i
go
with
all
3s
again
basically
i
didnt
think
the
beer
was
bad
or
anything
but
it
didnt
have
enough
other
characteristics
to
knock
my
sock
off
appearance
clear
amber
no
real
head
to
speak
of
and
i
poured
it
myself
aroma
is
a
bit
light
actually
mostly
low
malty
notes
tastewise
the
initial
sweetness
seems
a
bit
one
note
i
think
it
does
a
good
job
hiding
the
alcohol
after
that
initial
sweetness
the
finish
seems
a
bit
thin
and
undone
also
seems
a
bit
flat
unfortunately
nice
amber
appearence
i
was
expecting
a
very
hoppy
beer
from
this
brewery
nope
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
it
is
very
strong
at
8
2
abv
but
you
dont
notice
it
until
you
stand
up
no
strong
alcohol
burn
like
some
other
strong
beers
this
is
a
nice
replica
of
a
german
dopple
bock
after
drinkin
it
i
was
reaching
for
another
however
make
sure
you
are
at
home
and
not
driving
if
you
reach
for
another
the
carbonation
is
real
light
and
not
much
lace
clinging
to
my
glass
i
think
it
could
use
a
little
more
mouthfeel
for
a
beer
that
has
that
much
malt
overall
it
was
definantly
worth
26
50
for
a
case
great
value
for
your
money
thanks
to
merlin48
for
the
bottle
of
this
one
pours
a
ruby
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
too
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
color
seems
wrong
on
this
one
aroma
is
full
of
malty
goodness
with
some
nuttiness
nice
the
flavor
was
much
better
than
i
expected
very
nice
smooth
and
almost
creamy
lots
of
malty
caramel
goodness
and
a
slight
chocolate
and
roasted
character
this
one
surprised
me
and
i
liked
it
a
lot
thanks
merlin48
this
beer

liquid
the
nose
is
caramel

nutty

like

nice
with
a
prevalent
caramel
sweetness
laying
heavily
over
a
roasted

very
nice
i
like
the
balance
in
the
flavors
the
feel
is
thick
with
minimal
carbonation
i
find
this
beer
to
be
very
easy
drinking
the
flavors
are
really
nice
together
good
show
drinkability
filling
and
sweet
like
a
doppelbock
should
be
a
decent
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
the
head
is
dense
and
creamcolored
it
dies
filmy
very
nice
color

the

quite

delicious
what
im
looking
for
when
i
pop
a
doppel
a
balanced
smooth
brew
that
hits
me
as
well
on
style
finishes
with
a
tad
of
warming
alcohol
easy
to
sit
back
with
a
few
of
these
reviewed
in
jan
2005
hard
poured
to
obtain
almost
no
head
just
a
tiny
ring
around
the
glass
looks
like
a
gorgeous
bock
dark
rust
orange
in
color
but
is
mildly
cloudy
smells
of
caramel
chocolate
and
i
get
a
hint
of
orange
whoa
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
and
smooth
caramel
bready
vienna
or
munich
malt
and
a
bit
of
bakers
chocolate
which
i
certainly
wasnt
expecting
has
a
piercing
fine
carbonation
that
adds
a
hint
of
souracid
immediately
after
the
swallow
any
hop
bitterness
is
gentle
but
i
do
get
a
bit
of
zing
late
that
could
come
from
hops
tough
to
tell
as
the
zing
could
be
the
result
of
alcohol
and
carbonation
combined
this
beer
contains
some
bock
character
mixed
in
with
many
other
nontraditional
bock
characteristics
medium
thick
body
with
moderate
carbonation
but
the
carbonation
forms
piercing
bubbles
on
my
tongue
12
ounce
bottle
this
beer
is
a
clear
amber
with
not
much
head
retention
the
aroma
is
nutty
fruity
and
a
little
sour
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
the
malt
there
is
little
hopiness
a
bit
of
fruity
tartness
the
high
alcohol
content
is
noticable
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
really
call
this
a
doppelbock
actually
im
not
sure
what
style
i
would
put
this
in
ontap
at
the
drafting
room
in
exton
maybe
next
time
i
wont
be
having
a
big
fight
with
my
significant
other
when
im
sampling
this
one
either
way
a
very
nice
double
bock
dark
ruby
with
brown
edges
and
a
nice
enough
head
of
whipped
coffee
foam
aromas
are
all
about
sweet
roasted
malts
chocolate
malts
caramel
malts
and
malts
the
taste
follows
suit
and
as
i
find
most
doppels
it
is
quite
one
dimensional
but
still
damn
tasty
and
good
where
is
the
8
2
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
thick
warming
chewy
and
filling
drinkability
is
great
for
a
bigger
abv
lager
damn
good
stuff
i
hope
to
try
it
again
next
winter
i
stashed
this
bottle
for
several
months
to
see
what
would
happen
12
oz
with
no
freshness
date
served
at
about
50
degrees
pours
a
reddish
brown
more
red
than
brown
with
an
offwhite
1
finger
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
scents
are
very
sweet
caramel
butterscotch
chocolate
bubblegum
raisinsplumsfigs
alcohol
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
roses
hop
spiciness
is
the
first
flavor
to
hit
but
followed
closely
by
thick
chewy
malts
with
more
bubblegum
chocolate
dark
fruits
and
alcohol
citric
hop
flavors
and
hop
bitterness
eventually
make
themselves
known
has
a
nice
warming
feeling
too
thick
and
strong
to
make
a
good
session
beer
but
makes
a
wonderful
afterdinner
beer
i
dont
remember
the
other
5
beers
from
the
sixpack
smellingtasting
this
complex
even
though
i
dont
have
tasting
notes
from
those
im
going
to
go
out
on
a
limb
and
say
that
the
aging
had
a
positive
effect
on
this
beer
try
with
some
marinara
and
cheese
stuffed
pasta
of
your
choice
unsuspecting
folk
may
even
approach
the
glass
as
if
it
were
red
wine
because
in
the
right
light
it
looks
as
so
such
folk
are
in
for
a
bit
of
a
suprise
hard
to
believe
this
is
8
percent
abv
nice
pouring
the
troegenator
into
my
glass
it
appeared
an
amberchestnut
color
that
was
clear
and
clean
looking
with
a
nice
1
head
that
eventually
dissipated
leaving
a
nice
edge
layer
around
my
glass
upon
smelling
it
i
got
the
scent
of
plums
and
berries
throughout
its
body
it
also
smelled
very
clean
and
malty
taking
the
first
sip
i
got
a
bitter
and
smooth
taste
with
less
carbonation
than
expected
the
carbonation
that
was
there
tickled
the
front
of
my
tongue
a
bit
and
then
the
fruit
dark
malts
came
through
in
the
flavor
it
finished
with
a
smooth
almond
flavor
or
roasted
malts
mouthfeel
was
pretty
decent
in
that
the
carbonation
was
a
little
tickly
at
first
w
a
slight
alcohol
burn
at
the
swollow
however
much
time
spent
in
my
mouth
was
smooth
and
pretty
light
in
body
lighter
than
expected
another
nicely
done
product
by
the
troegners
i
filled
a
growler
of
this
at
the
brewery
the
beer
pours
into
my
pint
glass
a
clear
chestnut
color
with
beige
spongy
head
aroma
is
generally
sweet
with
fruit
white
grapes
plums
and
berries
some
toffee
and
a
lite
floral
hop
presence
overall
appealing
but
mild
flavor
is
sweet
up
front
as
well
with
caramel
and
toffee
giving
way
to
a
bit
of
earthy
hops
in
the
middle
and
then
a
roasted
malt
and
nutty
almond
finish
the
body
is
pretty
thick
and
texture
is
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
the
finish
is
fruity
and
chocolate
and
lingers
on
my
palate
for
a
while
after
swallowing
nice
complexity
for
a
clean
lager
lots
of
malt
and
only
a
faint
hop
presence
quite
a
tasty
brew
in
my
book
this
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
have
not
tried
too
many
of
this
style
but
i
really
expected
something
a
little
darker
in
color
and
stronger
in
flavor
this
poured
a
copper
color
brew
with
a
thin
white
head
the
smell
was
very
malty
and
sweet
the
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
with
not
much
else
going
on
slight
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
along
with
lingering
alcohol
smooth
mouthfeel
but
not
very
rich
good
drinkability
this
beer
is
good
tasting
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
i
wouldnt
search
it
out
either
dark
honey
colored
with
an
offwhite
head
that
rises
up
to
a
halfinch

lingers

some

finishes
with
some
cinnamon
and
a
faint
hop
flourish
plus
a
warming
tingle
of
alcohol
in
the
back
of
the
throat
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
nice
beer
but
could
be
a
lot
better
i
am
still
glad
to
have
tried
it
much
thanks
to
shapudding
for
the
beer
overallvery
good
interpretation
of
the
style
the
alcohol
doesnt
overpower
it
and
its
surprisingly
drinkable
retains
the
high
quality
of
troegs
in
its
own
fashion
and
while
i
prefer
some
of
troegs
other
offerings
only
because
this
isnt
my
most
favorite
style
i
can
still
recommend
drinking
it

a
12oz
bottle
from
vintage
cellar
blacksburg
va
this
beer
poured
a
dark
copper
color
and
was
a
little
cloudy
with
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
thin
foamy
head
produced
a
nice
lining
about
the
glass
the
aromas
i
detected
were
of
cherry
spice
and
maybe
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
was
interesting
at
first
i
encountered
a
strange
nutty
perhaps
chestnut
flavor
in
the
beginning
upon
subsequent
sips
i
found
fruit
and
a
bit
of
spice
and
bitterness
creeping
in
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
good
but
nothing
too
exciting
my
verdict
not
a
bad
beer
id
only
drink
it
if
there
were
no
better
alternative
drinkability
is
very
good
obviously
not
someting
you
are
going
to
make
a
session
out
of
due
to
the
high
abv
but
definitly
something
i
would
keep
on
hand
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
highly
recommended
beer
is
good
happy
beering
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
34
light
tan
head
over
the
clear
coppery
brew
head
is
frothy
yet
somewhat
shortlived
but
does
lace
more
than
most
of
the
style
aroma
is
lightly
of
sweet
maltiness
but
wish
it
was
more
intense
taste
is
sweetly
malty
as
the
nose
with
deep
grain
flavors
prevalent
a
touch
of
alcohol
becomes
apparent
at
the
end
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
good
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
and
worth
the
search
the
taste
is
very
good
again
with
a
hint
of
fruit
tangy
and
somewhat
spicy
there
is
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
aftertaste
which
lingers
nicely
at
the
top
of
the
mouth
the
label
says
8
2
alchohol
yet
there
was
no
alcoholic
taste
and
did
not
seem
that
strong
after
finishing
one
bottle

bock
a
malt
afficionados
dream
come
true
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
slight
head
off

leaving
a
slight
skim
on
top
with
a
grayish
pallor
aroma
is
heavily
malts
with
decided
scents
of
caramel
and
dried
fruits
the
taste
is
very
nice
warm
rich
taste
very
malty
with
a
bit
of
a
coffee
flavor
on
the
backend
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptionally
smooth
and
creamy
terrific
i
can
see
having
more
than
one
thanks
bif
for
the
sample
drinkability
although
it
is
not
a
match
to
its
best
german
counterparts
this
is
nevertheless
a
very
drinkable
brew
in
fact
you
can
drink
this
more
readily
than
a
german
as
it
is
less
of
a
sipping
beer
worth
another
try
i
am
admittedly
a
dopplebock
fan
and
this
one
is
although
different
a
very
fine
example
as
mentioned
in
several
other
reviews
this
beer
does
not
have
the
overly
viscous
mouthfeel
nor
the
sticky
sweet
finish
that
other
dbs
have
but
it
more
than
makes
up
for
it
with
the
malt
hammer
of
flavor
fruit
and
crystal
malts
predominate
and
the
carbonation
is
just
a
tad
more
than
i
would
have
expected
all
in
all
a
great
session
beer

you
dont
mind
the
8

and
one
that
you
should
seek
out
if
youre
in
pa
or
wherever
it
is
distributed
a
nice
doppelbock
but
unlike
any
ive
tried
from
germany
the
light
body
promotes
excellent
drinkability
but
the
alcohol
will
easily
sneak
up
on
you
if
you
exceed

almost
would
go
so

as
to
say
that
no

were
injured
during
the

of
this
beer
the
brew
does

a

is

the

smooth
the

is
pretty
good

for
a

drinkability
not
immensely
drinkable
its
not
bad
to
sip
or
to
sample
but
i
dont
think
ill
revisit
this
one
i
had
2
tonight
because
the
first
may
have
been
too
cold
and
i
feel
like
the
second
was
a
bit
forced
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
and
i
love
troegs
in
general
but
i
believe
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
will
depart
in
a
slow
manner
a
certain
sweet
nutty
character
pervades
the
mouth
upon
first
sip
to
be
followed
by
a
very
bitter
hoppy
finish
not
the
double
bock
characteristics
i
was
expecting
though
not
a
bad
beer
this
one
pours
a
brownish
red
color
with
a
thick
foamy
tan
head
this
one
smells
a
bit
fruity
with
notes
of
chocolate
and
caramel
the
nose
on
this
one
is
not
strong
at
all
malty
sweetness
is
what
comes
up
front
in
the
taste
followed
by
a
slightly
bitter
finish
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
the
8
2
percent
was
not
noticeable
which
defiantly
helped
the
drinkability
an
above
average
doppelbock
that
is
good
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
for
its
chewysweet
nature
this
is
highly
drinkaleits
noticbly
smooth
nature
good
drink
ay
time
of
the
year
notes
good
beer
not
an
outstanding
example
of
the
style
but
it
gets
the
point
across
and
is
flavorful
the
thin
mouthfeel
was
the
downfall

12
oz
bottle
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
with
a
smallish
head
that
didnt
stick
around
long
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
fruit
taste
is
more
of
the
malt
with
a
hop
twang
that
isnt
usually
present
in
a
double

mildly
carbonated
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
that
has
a
nice
quick
sweetness
followed
by
the
hop
twang
even
with
the
higher
alcohol
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
thanks
to
beerluvr
for
the
sample
this
is
not
the
classic
dopplebock
but
that
doesnt
take
away
from
the
fact
that
it
is
an
excellent
beer
it
pours
a
clear
mahogany
with
an
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
but
leaves
a
nice
ring
of
lacing
most
of
the
way
down
the
glass
the
aromas
are
strongly
double
bocklike
with
a
strong
maltiness
overlying
a
caramel
base
with
lots
of
fruitiness
mostly
raisins
and
figs
the
taste
is
strong
caramel
and
malty
until
the
fruitness
of
raisins
and
prunes
kicks
in
the
final
touch
is
a
bitterness
of
hops
that
is
unusual
in
a
double
bock
for
me
hops
is
never
a
bad
thing
so
this
didnt
bother
me
instead
it
enhanced
the
flavor
it
is
thick
and
sweetish
in
the
mouth
and
a
little
ascerbic
as
well
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
from
first
sip
to
last
and
always
makes
me
want
another
one
the
beer
seems
like
more
of
an
imperial
exportstyle
lager
than
a
doppelbock
the
hopping
is
way
overboard
i
think
reducing
the
huge
malty
sweetness
that
the
style
is
famous
for
a
bit
disappointing
considering
how
good
their
other
beers
are
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
i
just
dont
think
the
hops
work
with
the
malt
it
seems
to
clash
both
on
flavor
and
with
whats
customary
for
the
style
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
double
bock
poured
an
redish
brown
with
head
that
fars
quickly
to
small
ring
of
bubbles
smells
of
alcohol
bread
and
light
fruits
tastes
light
crisp
yeast
mixed
with
fruit
flavors
along
with
a
alcohol
finish
medium
bodied
brew
not
like
any
double
bock
i
have
had
before
not
bad
but
pass
me
a
salvator
next
time
troegs
keeps
reelin
me
in
further
with
each
brew
i
sample
of
theirs
and
i
can
make
that
statement
even
after
sampling
their
troegenator
which
while
still
a
good
enjoyable
brew
has
probably
been
my
least
favourite
of
their
offerings
thusfar
it
pours
a
nice
amber
colour
and
is
quite
clear
with
a
12
inch
light
tan
head
that
hangs
on
for
a
while
but
leaves
a
decent
stickiness
behind
the
smell
is
of
malt
earth
and
a
slight
sweet
cherry
the
brew
itself
is
medium
bodied
and
starts
off
with
a
bold
malt
flavour
moves
into
a
sweet
cherry
middle
and
has
a
nice
warm
alcohol
finish
this
one
is
not
as
hearty
or
complex
as
other
doppels
ive
sampled
at
times
it
didnt
even
seem
like
i
was
drinking
a
doppel
but
it
was
still
good
in
its
own
right
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
very
slight
dry
aftertaste
the
malt
flavors
last
on
the
tongue
for
a
while
after
swallowing
this
is
a
little
lighter
in
body
than
other
doppelbocks
which
adds
points
to
the
drinkability
scale
very
tasty
brew
poured
a
very
dark
orange
with
a
small
tan
head
that
dissipated
very
quickly
leaving
little
to
no
lacing
the
smell
was
malt
and
alcohol
with
some
hints
of
grain
and
caramel
the
taste
was
very
sweet
and
maltycaramel
the
malt
was
defiantly
the
dominant
flavor
very
little
hop
taste
and
some
alcohol
in
the
background
also
some
fruity
notes
were
evident
raisons
perhaps
mouthfeel
was
good
this
was
a
very
full
bodied
filling
beer
although
i
see
that
others
felt
it
was
thin
for
a
doublebock
reminded
me
of
a
barley
wine
in
its
sweetness
and
consistency
drinkability
was
good
as
well
i
would
have
another
if
i
happened
to
have
more
than
one
i
would
defiantly
try
this
doublebock
again

im
a
big
supporter
of
local
brews
and
im
real
happy
to
have
troegs
brewery
in
nearby
harrisburg
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favs
when
it
comes
to
us
brewed
dopplebacks
it
was
a
very
nice
dark
color
almost
motor
oil
with
a
tan
head
the
head
retention
was
very
nice
and
lasted
quite
a
little
time
it
then
fell
to
a
thick
laceing
the
taste
was
nice
and
fruity
more
of
the
plum
variety
plus
had
many
different
malts
included
it
resembled
the
belgian
brews
quite
well
i
would
recommend
this
one
for
anyone
that
is
looking
for
a
solid
us
brew
i
said
that
dopplebock
was
my
least
favorite
style
and
i
dislike
most
of
the
malt
monsters
but
this
is
so
wellbalanced
that
i
genuinely
can
enjoy
this
one
a
great
beer
from
a
great
pa
brewery
and
one
ill
be
looking
for
again
light
amber
color
and
head
that
quickly
dissappears
aroma
is
fruity
alcohol
and
not
much
more
the
fruit
that
comes
to
mind
in
the
aroma
is
peach
behind
that
fruit
is
a
hint
of
malt
flavor
is
sweet
and
then
quickly
leads
to
dry
finish
the
beer
is
very
crisp
the
alcohol
is
subdued
which
is
surprising
due
to
the
amount
of
alcohol
that
is
sensed
in
the
aroma
it
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
despite
an
8
2
abv
touted
on
the
label
overall
just
a
great
beer
enjoy
it
in
moderation
respect
it
ot
it
will
plow
you
one
of
the
best
offerings
by
troegs
drinkability
very
high
on
my
scale
this
is
a
warming
sweet
rich
brew
appears
a
deep
ruby
with
a
caramel
tan
head
very
nice
appearance
lacing
is
sporatic
and
scattered
but
its
all
good
aromatics
takeover
deep
over
ripened
plum
tones
drizzled
in
a
milk
chocolate
sauce
and
a
touch
of
floral
hops
lingering
taste
conists
of
waves
of
malt
this
is
one
malt
monster
very
nice
and
it
gets
more
and
more
appetising
with
every
sip
seems
chalk
full
of
caramel
malts
with
some
type
of
specialty
thrown
in
to
give
it
the
chocolate
finish
very
smooth
and
not
overly
sweet
a
great
strong
lager
thats
still
a
bit
dangerous
when
it
come
to
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
fuller
bodied
but
incredibly
smooth
at
the
same
time
no
cloying
textures
one
great
easy
sipper
this
beer
is
great
year
round
especially
when
your
in
the
mood
for
a
malty
dbock
with
trace
hops
it
is
very
rich
and
smooth
till
the
last
drop
loads
of
dark
malts
welcome
you
into
a
wellmade
doppelbock
i
think
the
fact
that
this
beer
was
very
heavy
and
i
had
it
in
90
sun
at
work
may
have
hurt
my
experience
a
bit
but
imagining
what
it
would
be
like
under
more
flattering
conditions
i
bet
it
would
be
great
some
coffee
and
chocolate
flavor
in
the
mix
it
had
a
good
deal
of
complexity
i
will
return
to
this
one
in
the
winter
if
the
hops
could
be
changed
and
the
malts
enhanced
slightly
roasted
this
beer
would
be
much
better
off
thanks
jarod
overall
a
bit
of
an
excursion
from
what
i
expect
from
a
doublebock
but
not
bad
the
lack
of
inherent
life
and
a
head
took
the
edge
off
of
a
solid
offering
that
could
have
notched
to
this
to
a
plus4

some

is

for
a
doppell
not
bad
but
not
sweet
enough
for
me
a
rather
respectable
dopple
with
malt
being
cables
that
keeps
this
bridge
afloat
smelled
of
chocolaty
sweet
malts
no
noticeable
hops
in
the
nose
but
that
goes
along
with
the
style
beer
was
having
a
problem
being
poured
and
would
foam
over
almost
every
time
that
is
was
poured
so
had
just
a
slight
carbonation
with
it
finally
settled
so
the
initial
pour
had
a
huge
head
but
when
i
was
finally
served
it
just
had
a
little
head
on
it
taste
is
of
sweet
chocolaty
malt
no
real
alcohol
flare
and
mouthful
is
thick
and
nourishing
tastes
to
good
to
be
this
strong
the
alcohol
taste
is
not
strong
for
as
high
as
it
is
great
flavor
and
very
drinkable
poured
out
a
nice
orange
amber
color
with
a
big
creamy
head
complex
aroma
of
caramel
fruits
and
malt
not
overwhelming
though
theres
some
grassy
hops
in
there
too
the
taste
is
very
nice
rich
with
complex
flavors
and
malty
sweet
very
drinkable
and
the
beer
has
hidden
the
alcohol
well
a
very
nice
and
flavorful
dopplebock
overall
impression
another
solid
brew
from
troegs
a
bit
one
dimensional
perhaps
but
extremely
well
crafted
well
balanced
and
drinkable
and
for
me
drinkability
in
many
dopplebocks
is
sometimes
lacking
finishes
up
clean
and
sweet
the
alcohol
making
a
lasting
impression
liquid
bread
indeed
i
think
ill
indulge
in
another
slice
or
two
o
6

pour
a
dark
red
with
a
tan
head
the
head
gives
away
quickly
to
very
little
lace
the
aroma
was
malt
and
hint
of
sweet
caramel
there
is
a
very
slight
hint
of
hops
mixed
in
the
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malt
up
front
followed
up
by
a
wave
of
alcohol
there
is
no
bitter
after
taste
with
this
beer
maybe
a
bit
weak
on
the
malt
taste
when
you
match
it
with
other
beer
of
this
kind
with
the
8
2
alcohol
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
overall
a
bit
above
average
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
beer
it
wasnt
my
idea
of
a
true
dopplebock
it
pours
a
nice
dark
copper
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
away
quickly
the
aroma
isnt
as
sweet
as
most
dopplebocks
that
ive
had
caramel
hops
and
roasted
malts
are
the
most
apparent
scents
the
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
with
a
slight
caramely
sweetness
detected
upon
the
first
taste
with
mild
chocolate
undertones
there
is
however
a
dominating
taste
of
alcohol
noted
during
the
entire
drinking
experience
the
body
is
very
thin
and
bitter
this
is
a
decent
beer
from
tröegs
but
not
the
best
that
ive
had
from
them
ive
enjoyed
troegs
brews
in
the
past
so
when
i
saw
this
one
i
snatched
it
up
in
a
hurry
unfortunately
it
disappoints
for
those
expecting
a
dopplebock
dark
reddish
amber
with
a
smallish
head
and
very
little
carbonation
it
has
decent
malty
scent
but
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
fairly
hoppy
and
watery
for
the
style
it
seems
american
breweries
just
cant
compare
when
it
comes
to
this
style
on
the
plus
side
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
is
nicely
masked
but
i
find
myself
noticing
grainy
hoppy
american
pale
ale
characteristics
while
drinking
decent
brew
but
way
off
the
mark
for
the
style
fairly
light
compared
to
other
double
bocks
ive
had
by
light
i
mean
in
color
texture
and
flavor
color
is
light
brown
with
orangish
notes
head
is
off
white
and
quickly
fades
flavor
is
predominately
sweet
malts
but
not
as
strong
as
offerings
such
as
paulaners
and
sas
theres
some
mellow
and
let
me
emphasize
mellow
hop
flavor
in
there
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
in
fact
i
was
surprised
when
i
saw
it
was
8
2
when
i
looked
it
up
to
write
a
review
a
good
double
bock
if
not
somewhat
out
of
the
ordinary
not
the
moravian
malt
tripledecocted
melanoidininfused
deeplagered
doppel
ive
come
to
love
but
still
a
pretty
righteous
brew
a
crystalclear
reddishamber
body
lies
beneath
a
creamy
light
tan
head
that
both
holds
well
and
leaves
nice
lace
throughout
the
glass
some
alcohol
is
noteable
in
the
aroma
but
it
adds
rather
than
detracts
mingling
with
a
gently
toasty
maltiness
and
light
floral
hoppiness
its
mediumfull
body
is
enhanced
by
a
very
fine
median
carbonation
that
gives
it
a
touch
of
crispness
on
the
tongue
before
releasing
its
gasses
and
becoming
creamysmooth
the
flavor
is
quite
bold
with
a
rich
bready
and
toasty
malt
it
doesnt
have
the
lightly
chocolatey
character
that
some
doppelbocks
have
but
it
does
contain
a
mild
fruitiness
floral
and
spicy
hops
balance
with
both
flavor
and
a
gently
restrained
bitterness
again
the
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
and
helps
to
dry
the
finish
and
leaves
a
touch
of
spiciness
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
with
more
fruitiness
and
floral
hop
flavor
coming
through
than
many
darker
maltladen
versions
exhibit
in
fact
its
very
much
like
and
xl
helles
bock
quite
enjoyable
and
probably
too
drinkable
considering
its
strength
well
worth
trying
this
is
an
interesting
offering
in
the
world
of
american
double
beers
it
pours
a
facinating
shade
of
reddish
pinkish
brown
the
malt
is
pronounced
but
not
overpowering
and
the
finish
is
quite
sweet
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
which
is
interesting
considering
it
weighs
in
at
8
2
all
in
all
a
good
lighterstyle
double
for
the
warmer
summer
months
though
nothing
outstanding
reminds
me
oddly
enough
of
a
spanish
or
french
rose
wine
pours
a
medium
copper
color
topped
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
head
slowly
fades
to
just
a
ring
of
foam
strong
caramel
aromas
are
blended
with
hints
of
roasted
malt
and
hops
the
hops
are
noticeable
immediately
on
the
tongue
but
then
a
myriad
of
flavors
fall
in
behind
it
on
the
first
sip
i
get
roasted
malts
caramel
a
bit
of
alcohol
touches
of
lemon
and
a
bit
of
a
black
licorice
note
a
bit
of
a
toasted
butter
note
finishes
out
the
first
taste
the
second
sip
is
sweeter
with
touches
of
dark
molasses
with
a
slight
dark
chocolate
component
this
is
an
impressively
complex
beer
the
abv
is
noticeable
but
some
time
in
the
bottle
may
help
diminish
the
alcohol
esters
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
not
heavy
as
many
dopples
tend
to
be
this
is
a
big
beer
that
could
be
enjoyed
easily
on
a
warm
spring
day
it
has
decent
hopping
rates
a
clean
mouthfeel
and
a
great
finish
an
excellent
beer
from
troegs
a
brewery
i
am
gradually
becoming
more
familiar
with
that
continues
to
impress
this
beer
is
hefty
the
malts
are
strong
and
filling
the
nose
is
malty
and
the
hops
dont
really
shine
through
the
beer
is
all
about
malt
the
head
is
quite
thin
and
fades
to
almost
nothing
the
beer
is
quite
red
with
some
brown
as
well
the
alcohol
is
quite
present
as
you
move
to
the
middle
of
the
brew
this
beer
is
a
meal
in
itself
and
is
quite
a
treat
to
close
out
the
winter
season

troegenators
have
had
nice
thick
and
full
heads
with
good
lacing
either
i
had
a
bad
batch
or
perhaps
an
old
one
in
any
event
i
am
updating
my
review
and
changing
some
numbers
accordingly
appearance
is
a
dark
brown
barely
able
to
see
through
slight
head
that
fades
quickly
and
settles
to
a
14
inch
collar
smells
are
that
of

dark
roasted
big
malt
taste
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
in
the
end
slightly
short
mouthfeel
a
little
dry
with
a
tart
short
finish
of
hops
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
very
drinkable
as
the
alcohol
is
not
easily
detected
nice
beer
from
troegs
first
id
like
to
say
that
everytime
i
drink
this
beer
it
gets
better
and
better
and
new
and
exciting
flavors
seem
to
emerge
so
i
might
have
to
rereview
it
from
time
to
time
now
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
crystal
clear
lightly
carbonated
redorange
color
the
head
was
thick
and
creamy
and
the
color
was
a
beige
color
that
had
a
orange
hue
to
it
it
was
a
long
lasting
head
that
never
really
disappeared
and
some
remnants
were
still
there
at
the
last
sip
and
the
lace
was
much
like
the
head
it
was
sticky
and
it
stretched
to
almost
the
bottom
the
aroma
was
fairly
simple
at
this
time
the
first
thing
that
hit
me
in
the
face
was
oranges
fresh
oranges
then
a
slight
wave
of
floral
and
citrus
hops
bit
at
my
nose
some
creamy
chocolate
malt
seemed
to
also
be
present
i
noticed
it
before
but
it
is
very
slight
but
mostly
i
smelled
oranges
the
taste
was
more
complex
then
i
would
have
thought
i
tasted
fruit
oranges
some
light
citrus
hops
which
made
it
slightly
bitter
a
light
creamy
milk
chocolate
malt
in
the
middle
kind
of
made
my
mouth
feel
watery
and
hints
of
alcohol
were
also
present
in
the
late
middle
and
at
the
end
the
last
taste
to
come
to
me
at
the
end
were
citrus
hops
but
it
was
well
blended
this
beer
was
creamy
in
texture
and
very
satisfying
a
good
beer
to
always
have
somewhere
either
on
tap
or
six
pack
also
a
very
sneaky
beer
you
feel
fine
and
great
while
sitting
and
having
2
or
3
but
watch
out
when
you
get
up
because
you
will
have
the
jimmy
legs
o
a
pleasing
flavorful
brew
wickedly
easydrinking
for
an
8
5
if
bitterness
is
all
ascribed
to
hops
rather
than
alcohol
the
high
abv
here
would
be
virtually
unnoticeable
roasted
mild
coffee
aroma
with
a
smidgen
of
hops
taste
starts
with
that
familiar
roasted
malt
then
comes
caramel
and
toffee
after
not
too
sweet
a
tame
beast
but
chock
full
of
flavor
overall
clearly
this
is
the
best
domestic
doppelbock
of
the
nonbarrel
aged
variety
quite
a
claim
threats
of
anorexia
nervosa
setting
in
aside
i
found
this
to
be
tasty
tasty
tasty
a
bit
dense
for
summer
but
a
worthy
brew
nonetheless
between
you
i
i
still
had
lunch
overall
this
is
a
great
lager
but
im
hesitant
to
hold
this
in
the
same
regard
as
celebrator
troegenator
or
other
great
examples
of
the
style
style
guidelines
certainly
wont
stop
me
from
drinking
this
beer
regularly
in
the
future
overall
a
very
good
doppelbock
but
different
than
other
beers
in
the
same
style
i
was
looking
for
more
of
a
bready
and
malty
presence
the
taste
profile
also
diminishes
with
warming
this
could
be
due
to
the
bottle
date
o
excellent
doppelbock
very
malty
bready
type
malts
grainy
to
the
core
its
quite
good
but
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
compared
to
some
traditional
german
doppelbocks
like
celebrator
or
korbinian
note
this
bottle
had
some
age
on
it
10
months
to
be
precise
this
was
my
first
taste
of
this
offering
so
i
cannot
say
how
this
aged
version
compares
to
a
freshy
given
that
the
age
may
very
well
have
smoothed
out
this
beer
because
it
was
very
smooth
for
a
doppelbock
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
amber
highlights
and
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
bready
malts
some
alcohol
taste
is
dark
fruits
caramel
malts
some
alcohol
a
touch
of
sweetness
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
high
quality
beer
worth
seeking
out
o
this
is
an
awesome
beer
and
a
fantastic
doppelbock
its
just
loaded
with
brilliant
malty
aromas
and
flavors
is
extraordinarily
tasty
and
is
frighteningly
drinkable
for
clocking
in
at

abv
jared
thank
you
so
much
for
giving
me
the
chance
to
try
this
thanks
to
davey101
for
this
one
overall
pretty
good
but
it
doesnt
seem
superb
the
4pack
i
bought
was
about
11
months
old
so
that
could
certainly
play
a
part
very
rich
and
seemingly
thick
but
it
doesnt
feel
it
as
youre
drinking
overall
its
more
of
a
lager
than
a
dopplebock
yet
it
is
very
drinkable
worth
the
price
of
admission
poured
a
deep
mahogany
with

12

very

and

flavors
start
off
with
the
dark
fruit
notes
dipped
in
alcoholdeep
molasses
flavors
really
take
over
but
never
get
to
sweetthe
alcohol
is
always
there
but
never
to
much
so
i
finally
got
to
try
this
beer
and
i
was
not
dissapointedworthy
of
high
marks
o
this
is
the
best
doppelbock
i
have
had
i
love
how
even
though
it
is
a
thick
and
heavy
beer
after
you
finish
a
bottle
you
dont
feel
full
or
sluggish
this
is
a
great
beer
to
start
expanding
your
palate
with
o
makes
me
want
to
explore
doppelbocks
hence
the
high
rating
a
strong
beer
w
beautifully
strong
flavors
a
showcase
for
this
style
its
a
bit
macro
or
ordinary
but
it
had
some
good
finishing
qualities
overall
a
pretty
good
doppelbock
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
no
head
or
lacing
its
aroma
is
of
coffee
and
burnt
toast
with
a
hint
of
anise
the
flavor
is
coffee
with
notes
of
black
licorice
and
cough
syrup
there
is
a
long
lasting
dark
roasted
malt
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syruplike
thomas
hooker
liberator
doppelbock
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
not
recommended
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
good
stuff
not
a
doppelbock
o
a
superb
take
on
the
style
drinkability
a
superb
doppelbock
sweet
roasty
up
front
some
bite
heat
and
more
roastiness
at
the
end
delicious
overall
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
i
know
a
damn
good
doppelbock
when
i
see
one
thumbs
way
up
on
this
one
overall
my
second
thomas
hooker
the
first
being
the
imperial
porter
if
all
their
beers
are
this
good
i
want
more
overall
a
full
flavored
doppelbock
that
really
hits
the
spot
when
looking
for
the
style
worthy
of
trying
this
one
overall
a
very
enjoyable
balanced
beer
that
should
be
graded
on
its
overall
enjoyability
and
taste
not
on
how
strict
it
follows
the
style
guideline
ok
not
must
have
i
have
had
my
eye
on
this
beer
for
several
years
and
finally
saw
it
at
a
local
liquor
store
my
expectations
may
have
been
a
bit
high
but
overall
a
very
nice
brew
and
something
i
would
buy
again
this
is
delicious
reminds
me
much
more
of
a
wee
heavy
than
a
doppelbock
especially
americanmade
which
tend
to
be
boozy
messes
but
ill
take
it
rich
satisfying
anyway
i
rated
this
beer
as
it
deserved
but
i
suspect
many
other
reviewers
drank
something
better
cest
la
vie
o
overall
this
certainly
isnt
my
favorite
style
and
i
do
tend
to
favor
the
ale
styles
over
the
lagers
in
general
that
being
said
though
i
have
found
a
couple
doppelbocks
to
be
pretty
damn
good
much
better
than
this
one
particularly
ive
found
ayinger
celebrator
to
be
excellent
and
since
i
had
heard
this
one
being
compared
to
celebrator
i
was
excited
to
try
it
needless
to
say
it
definitely
let
me
down
i
will
not
try
this
one
again
and
will
probably
completely
avoid
the
style
for
a
while
12
oz

with
a
fluffy

aroma
is
of
herbal
hops
caramel
and
dark

medium

stale
taste

prevails
despite
on
there
are
plenty
of
nice
notes
of
caramel
coffee
herbal

and
dark
fruit
the
impression
of
the
beer
remains
unpleasant
i
hate
when
brewers
do
not
put
the
best
by
date
on
bottles
this
one
poured
out
looking
pretty
thick
it
got
me
a
little
excited
when
i
saw
how
it
looked
the
color
was
a
deep
brown
tone
with
a
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
lots
of
malt
and
sweet
grain
aromas
some
toasted
and
chocolate
aromas
were
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
nice
smooth
semi
sweet
with
a
bitterness
in
the
back
end
to
sum
it
all
up
the
mouthfeel
was
actually
on
the
thicker
side
and
had
a
creamier
feel
to
it
than
i
expected
overall
its
a
very
enjoyable
brew
pours
a
dark
colabrown
with
a
nice
khakicolored
head
that
quickly
dissipate
leaving
some
spotty
haze
and
a
slight
ring
aromas
of
dark
malt
dried
fruits
caramel
and
chocolate
dominate
the
nose
and
the
taste
follows
along
nicely
getting
a
good
amount
of
the
chocolate
malt
and
fruit
in
the
taste
those
are
definitely
the
standouts
with
spicy
yeast
caramel
and
baked
bread
notes
as
well
mouthfeel
fairly
creamy
with
a
touchovermedium
body
and
good
carbonation
overall
one
of
the
better
bocks
ive
had
but
its
still
not
a
style
i
go
crazy
for
sorry
3
a
single
at
the
time
though
im
not
sure
whether
or
not
i
got
a
bad
bottle
i
can
say
with
certainty
that
this
was
a
chore
to
drink
unpalatable
o
i
ended
up
pouring
it
out
about
half
way
though
the
tartness
was
overwhelming
and
out
of
character
for
a
dopplebock
i
will
have
to
give
this
another
shot
later
my
experience
seems
out
of
line
with
a
lot
of
the
other
reviews
i
read
hopefully
just
a
bad
bottle
od
this
lives
up
to
the
hype
easy
to
drink
i
must
age
this
in
my
opinion
good
but
maybe
i
am
in
the
minority
it
didnt
blow
me
away
as
compared
to
others
in
the
style
i
have
tried
a
carbonated
essence
about
it
but
maybe
i
got
a
bad
4
pack
from
the
local
store
a
wellmade
beer
by
all
accounts
o
my
favorite
doppelbock
im
not
being
a
homer
either
i
much
prefer
it
to
even
the
mighty
celebrator
a
real
shining
example
that
ct
can
make
a
world
class
beer
o
i
see
the
appeal
for
sure
its
everything
a
doppelbock
should
be
malty
sweet
and
chewy
even
though
they
really
arent
my
thing
if
they
were
this
would
be
my
go
to
for
sure
light
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
tickling
your
tongue
as
you
drink
alcohol
is
well
hidden
despite
being
so
malty
finishing
clean
and
dry
o
i
love
a
good
bock
this
is
a
great
one
probably
not
the
ideal
beer
for
a
sweltering
july
evening
but
i
enjoyed
it
all
the
same
this
is
a
big
beer
and
youll
probably
never
drink
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
wait
for
sweater
weather
invite
some
friends
over
and
enjoy
a
sixpack
with
company
o
nothing
wrong
but
nothing
wonderfull
a
solid
c
i
probably
let
this
one
sit
too
long
the
taste
was
ok
just
not
as
good
as
is
probably
used
to
be
this
is
by
far
the
best
doppelbock
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
the
appearance
is
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
1
5
finger
tan
colored
head
the
smell
is
roasted
malts
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
tiny
bit
of
sweetness
to
the
aroma
the
taste
folllows
the
smell
with
a
nice
roasty
slightly
sweet
flavor
and
hints
of
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodiied
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
an
a
definitely
worth
seeking
out
overall
the
best
doppelbock
ive
had
better
than
celebrator
gasp
this
is
one
of
the
few
lager
styles
i
really
enjoy
d
i
always
find
it
difficult
to
describe
the
flavors
in
a
doppelbock
this
one
has
less
of
a
soy
sauce
flavor
then
some
but
all
of
the
flavors
together
kind
of
form
that
saucy
characteristic
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
an
easy
drink
the
8
is
hidden
very
well
with
the
malts
o
a
nice
creamy
beer
one
of
the
best
doppels
i
have
ever
had
not
too
heavy
or
overwhelming
great
beer
o
this
is
a
great
dopplebock
its
fresh
in
season
and
just
right
for
the
moment
theres
a
lot
to
be
said
for
drinking
in
season
and
its
beers
like
this
that
really
lets
one
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
the
ride
drink
i
can
see
why
this
is
so
highly
rated
this
was
flavorful
and
balanced
and
resrained
i
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
it
was
sweet
fruity
creamy
and
just
plain
good
o
not
saying
this
just
to
be
a
homer
but
one
of
the
most
satisfying
american
versions
of
a
doppelbock
ive
ever
had
liberator
has
the
complex
malt
sweetness
nice
roasted
flavors
and
alcohol
to
warm
you
then
a
very
fruity
and
floral
hop
profile
to
cut
that
sweetness
and
make
the
brew
dangerously
drinkable
at
8
abv
pushing
the
envelope
to
unseat
hop
meadow
ipa
as
my
favorite
hooker
beer
mouthfeel
is
stupendous
full
and
thick
and
sticky
with
perfect
carbonation
overall
delicious
really
really
delicious
period
best
doppelbock
on
the
planet
affordable
and
available
and
perfect
what
else
is
there
to
say
overall
done
very
well
lots
of
nice
flavors
and
aromas
all
blended
together
which
separate
a
bit
on
the
finish
but
nothing
too
much
its
a
very
nice
beer
and
extremely
drinkable
it
would
have
been
an
a
probably
if
it
wasnt
for
that
flavor
separation
at
the
end
and
slight
astringent
like
hit
from
the
hops
a
good
domestic
rendition
of
a
doppelbock
though
there
are
some
very
faint
offnotes
suggesting
imperfection
in
the
brewing
process
or
maybe
i
just
dont
like
their
yeast
strain
very
good
but
with
a
little
more
care
at
the
brewery
i
expect
this
could
be
worldclass
d
semi
easy
drinker
but
not
something
i
would
drink
all
night
the
flavor
is
very
coffe
chocolate
taste
and
something
that
not
all
beer
drinkers
prefer
in
a
nice
beer
not
that
drinkable
taste
is
very
grainy
on
the
finish
something
i
just
dont
like
theres
a
oddly
dry
finish
but
my
lips
feel
a
bit
sugary
sweet
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
thick
with
light
carbonation
overall
its
decent
but
not
phenomenal
overall
very
good
beer
overall
i
would
definitely
recommend
checking
this
one
out
especially
if
you
are
a
fan
of
doppelbocks
d
really
solid
doppelbock
i
got
this
from
samueljackson45
in
a
bif
and
was
really
excited
about
it
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
while
luckily
i
have
one
more
bottle
because
i
definitely
want
another
thanks
for
sending
me
this
way
evan
2nd
bottle
i
had
of
this
was
better
on
the
aroma
and
outstanding
on
all
other
fronts
overall
thoroughly
enjoyable
nice
kick
to
it
too
at
8
percent
abv
a
serious
beer
that
commands
your
palates
full
attention
lots
of
beers
are
interesting
or
refreshing
this
is
truly
delicious
yay
nutmeg
state
drinkability
very
nice
though
the
fruity
tanginess
was
throwing
me
off
heading
downhill
already
would
like
to
try
it
closer
to
its
release
but
i
was
pleased
overall
d
wow
i
really
wish
i
had
access
to
this
it
is
killer
happy
i
tried
it
again
quite
nice
the
cpj
d
since
it
is
pretty
sweet
and
rich
this
one
is
a
sipper
but
i
could
see
having
more
than
one
in
an
evening
so
far
ive
been
pretty
unimpressed
with
thomas
hookers
beers
that
is
until
now
this
one
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
i
have
found
their
beers
to
be
ordinary
at
best
but
this
is
a
great
doppelbock
and
an
excellent
little
winter
beer
d
fair
not
one
id
have
a
few
of
in
a
sitting
but
damn
its
tasty
good
stuff
one
of
the
best
american
takes
on
the
style
for
sure
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
wellexecuted
big
thanks
to
pabs311
for
a
nonswing
top
bottle
version
of
this
one
as
an
extra
in
a
past
trade
served
from
bottle
into
a
grolsch
pilsner
poured
redbrown
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
slight
alcohol
caramel
cream
and
chocolate
upon
warming
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
just
plain
excellent
it
was
very
complex
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
while
be
pleasurable
to
both
as
well
not
a
whole
lot
can
be
done
to
improve
this
one
without
moving
to
another
style
this
is
a
definite
must
try
even
if
you
dont
like
the
style
which
i
usually
dont
d
very
nice
beer
that
goes
down
easy
as
a
native
of
simsbury
ct
i
am
proud
of
this
brewery
that
is
just
one
town
over
d
its
good
but
im
not
one
to
drink
tons
of
doppelbocks
i
was
glad
to
try
it
though
drinkability
in
the
past
i
have
had
issues
with
the
thomas
hooker
fliptop
bottles
a
few
flat
bottles
a
few
infected
bottles
and
plenty
of
money
down
the
drain
left
me
nothing
but
ill
will
towards
the
brewery
so
its
nice
that
this
revisit
years
later
was
a
return
to
a
mighty
tasty
doppelbock
i
feel
like
im
drinking
a
fine
red
wine
but
better
reviewed
on
5302010
bottle
thanks
to
honuswagner
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
light
tan
head
aroma
of
sweet
malt
candi
sugar
flavor
of
sourness
initially
a
tart
lactic
swallow
sweet
candi
sugar
sweet
malt
lots
of
residual
sugars
in
this
one
hmm
not
really
a
fan
of
this
one
it
is
way
too
sweet
and
doesnt
have
a
strong
malt
backbone
compared
to
other
doppelbocks
i
have
had
this
is
not
one
of
the
better
ones
d
dont
waste
your
money
on
this
crap
d
this
beer
has
sky
high
drknkability
and
tastes
delicious
it
goes
down
nice
and
snooth
d
very
well
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
love
to
try
again
m
d
medium
in
body
co2
in
balance
and
the
abv
was
wellconcealed
d
not
syrupy
or
overly
sweet
at
all
goes
down
great
im
a
pretty
huge
fan
of
hops
but
i
could
drink
this
all
night
thanks
again
for
this
one
josh
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
big
you
get
the
essence
of
the
8
00
abv
but
it
does
not
detract
from
the
quality
of
a
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
because
of
the
rather
sheepish
cover
art
but
i
was
very
much
surprised
at
how
friendly
and
delicious
this
beer
was
i
know
for
certain
if
im
planning
to
cozy
up
to
warm
fire
nibbling
on
some
bonbons
ill
be
sure
to
have
some
liberator
to
set
me
and
my
loins
free
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
doppelbocks
i
like
the
idea
of
this
style
and
most
often
i
like
the
taste
but
the
boozy
edge
can
be
a
turnoff
hookers
doppelbock
has
an
alcoholic
burn
that
nearly
overtakes
some
of
the
more
pleasant
aspects
of
this
beer
including
its
very
pleasant
honeysuckle
aroma
but
as
it
warms
up
the
burn
fades
somewhat
i
expected
the
opposite
and
thats
worth
a
few
points
on
my
scorecard
i
bought
this
as
a
single
but
can
see
keeping
a
six
in
the
fridge
door
as
a
winter
warmer
good
for
accompanying
a
heavy
meal
or
for
drinking
while
playing
brahms
drinkability
this
can
be
a
slow
sipper
with
its
complex
nature
but
it
is
so
enjoyable
i
ended
up
getting
through
it
pretty
quickly
this
stands
up
with
the
best
of
them
going
to
be
getting
a
bottle
of
celebrator
to
check
this
against
very
soon
a
great
american
made
world
class
doppelbock
drinks
like
liberation
despite
the
mouthfeel
liberator
rightfully
earns
its
place
among
the
top
doppelbocks
in
the
country
freeing
us
from
the
spectre
of
subpar
lagers
overall
a
really
good
doppelbock
and
something
i
would
highly
recommend
appears
deep
dark
brown
loose
tan
head
slowly
falls
to
a
big
ring
and
a
wispy
layer
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
huge
upon
opening
i
can
smell
the
rich
dark
malt
from
two
feet
away
toffee
brown
sugar
caramel
chocolate
bready
too
the
taste
has
the
above
flavors
but
added
to
the
mix
is
dark
fruit
black
licorice
a
little
dry
charcoal
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
superb
medium
body
and
richly
smooth
fine
carbonation
which
is
fairly
mild
overall
it
is
really
something
special
even
with
several
years
on
it
rich
and
delicious
though
i
could
probably
not
drink
much
more
than
one
because
of
that
big
booze
big
malts
that
is
the
first
impression
this
is
for
sure
a
sipper
on
a
cold
night
my
only
problem
is
that
the
booze
overpowers
the
beer
a
tad
get
more
of
the
8
than
the
malty
backbone
that
comes
through
on
the
taste
big
caramel
burnt
fruit
but
overall
boozetown
solid
beer
not
by
style
d
pretty
good
d
the
flavor
and
aroma
is
not
quite
worldclass
but
the
drinkability
is
first
imperial
pint
glass
pours
with
a
1
dark
tan
head
which
laces
tremendously
ohsobarely
translucently
dark
dark
brown
mahogany
if
you
will
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
aroma
just
not
quite
as
intense
as
i
would
like
taste
is
lightly
chocolately
dark
malts
initially
which
almost
melt
in
your
mouth
then
it
slowly
segues
into
a
bit
more
intense
dopple
flavor
with
just
the
slighest
tinge
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
one
of
the
best
constructed
i
think
i
have
ever
had
mouthfeel
is
and
drinkability
are
both
incredible
you
locals
stop
talking
up
the
liberator
leave
it
instate
for
the
locals
and
neighboring
states
d
its
a
good
dopplebock
rich
and
sweet
but
is
showing
signs
of
decline
d
not
bad
for
drinkability
but
this
is
definitely
not
right
i
dont
know
if
its
infected
todd
talked
about
issues
with
the
12
oz
bottles
but
regardless
id
love
to
try
it
fresh
and
clean
soon
unfiltered
chestnut
color
tall
heavy
head
that
builds
slowly
alluring
nose
plum
juice
and
crystallized
sugar
hints
of
smoke
licorice
and
port
wine
lightly
carbonated
soft
spongelike
body
tastes
of
mediumroasted
malts
coupled
with
more
candied
malt
notes
mineral
notes
and
vague
plum
acidity
combine
for
a
leathery
effect
at
the
back
of
the
throat
while
smokiness
persists
mild
mineral
roasted
barley
twang
spicy
anise
and
woodsy
notes
diffuse
the
sweetness
at
the
finish
while
the
understatedly
juicy
hops
remain
in
the
background
delectable
flavors
overall
this
brew
was
recommended
and
it
did
not
disappoint
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
thick
creamy
feel
rich
smooth
with
a
nice
coating
of
the
palate
fairly
full
bodied
with
practically
no
effervescence
at
all
a
truly
fabulous
beer
drink
several
but
do
so
at
a
relaxed
pace
or
itll
get
you
with
8
abv
12oz
bottle
pours
a
black
viscous
color
with
a
mediumsized
head
no
lacing
aromas
of
fruit
bread
and
some
booziness
taste
is
somewhat
chocolately
with
some
fruit
and
warming
alcohol
flavors
good
doppelbock
not
overly
drinkable
but
not
a
full
on
sipper
either
perfect
beer
for
the
colder
seasons
glad
to
see
ct
has
a
beer
that
has
cracked
the
top
100
too
rich
for
for
a
session
but
just
right
with
my
cheesesteak
sandwich
perfect
on
a
chilly
sunday
afternoon
db
i
started
liking
the
nose
more
than
the
flavor
but
the
flavor
really
opens
up
as
this
thing
gets
warm
it
is
complex
but
smooth
and
well
balanced
one
of
those
beers
where
you
could
just
go
on
forever
listing
flavors
that
hit
your
palate
for
the
price
this
one
lands
itself
in
the
snpa
and
nugget
nectar
category
affordable
beers
that
are
delicious
quite
drinkable
indeed
id
love
to
try
this
again
next
to
my
other
favorite
doppelbock
ayinger
celebrator
and
see
how
it
compares
this
is
a
style
im
generally
frustrated
with
because
most
of
the
american
examples
are
a
hotsweet
mess
thomas
hooker
is
the
first
american
made
doppelbock
ive
tried
that
woos
me
a
pleasure
to
drink
again
the
taste
was
licorice
prunes
just
stuff
i
dont
like
much
less
in
my
beer
no
hops
cant
call
this
smooth
it
has
such
an
alcohol
presence
just
a
rough
experience
really
not
anything
id
like
to
experience
again
especialy
at
this
cost
the
leaving
falls
church
uberbender
rolls
on
this
entry
pours
a
translucent
if
not
clear
garnet
brown
topped
by
a
healthy
helping
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
figs
dark
wheat
cinnamon
nutmeg
raisins
brown
sugar
molasses
maple
syrup
plums
and
cinnamon
bubble
gum
think
dentyne
with
flavor
crystals
damn
this
thing
smells
kinda
like
a
quad
only
browner
the
taste
is
a
bit
lighter
than
the
smell
with
more
fruity
notes
and
a
heavier
dose
of
baked
oatmeal
cookies
beyond
that
the
elements
of
the
nose
all
return
this
is
pretty
dern
tasty
baby
the
body
is
a
firm
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
ridiculously
smooth
feel
i
gotta
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
ive
yet
had
get
some
d
pretty
drinkable
brew
pretty
good
beer
as
well
definitely
an
enjoyable
doppelbock
i
would
drink
this
again
but
wouldnt
go
nuts
trying
to
find
it
dit
is
a
delicious
beer
but
it
doesnt
lend
itself
to
having
more
than
one
but
having
one
is
certainly
an
enjoyable
experience
pours
a
solid
almost
black
with
the
faintest
of
garnet
highlights
when
held
to
light
bubbly
off
white
head
rises
to
the
occasion
before
slowly
receding
to
a
ring
on
top
smells
of
malt
in
spades
smokey
dark
sugar
fig
raisin
caramel
chocolates
soy
they
are
all
there
taste
is
a
malt
bomb
as
well
rich
dark
malts
fill
my
palette
with
tastes
of
caramel
fig
date
and
hints
of
alcohol
and
a
slightly
earthy
hop
bite
that
keeps
everything
in
check
medium
carbonation
thick
body
syrupy
mouthfeel
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
sweet
malty
goodness
with
a
burnt
edge
that
keeps
it
from
being
cloying
if
this
were
more
available
i
would
drink
this
a
lot
this
is
my
first
foray
into
the
land
of
steady
habits
the
beer
poured
an
almost
black
colour
into
my
pintglass
lacing
was
minimal
but
the
offwhite
head
was
good
smells
and
tastes
bready
with
a
hint
of
malts
and
the
body
is
medium
to
heavy
with
a
dry
finish
i
think
troegenator
is
still
the
best
doppelbock
in
the
northeast
though
and
i
prob
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
one
again
this
is
an
excellent
doppelbock
and
i
cant
find
anything
i
dont
like
about
it
all
in
all
a
good
beer
but
i
didnt
find
anything
special
about
it
d
maybe
doppelbocks
arent
my
thing
or
maybe
the
flavors
off
because
they
decided
to
put
this
in
12
oz
bottles
now
a
good
dopplebock
but
i
must
be
missing
something
that
keeps
this
brew
in
the
top
100
extremely
tasty
and
super
drinkable
this
thing
goes
down
with
ease
and
its
so
good
the
more
the
merrier
overall
love
this
brew
will
be
drinking
again
soon
could
age
even
longer
and
shows
no
signs
of
going
downhill
poured
from
a
cellar
temperature
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
the
beer
is
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
very
big
off
white
head
it
is
made
up
of
large
bubbles
but
has
a
cap
of
foam
on
top
there
was
some
clinging
carbonation
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
but
they
have
disappeared
it
is
a
very
pretty
beer
this
beer
has
a
very
pleasant
aroma
it
is
full
of
roasted
malts
almost
coffee
like
in
their
scent
but
not
quite
there
is
also
some
dark
chocolate
and
caramel
sweetness
as
well
as
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
it
all
works
very
well
together
the
beer
starts
out
with
a
nice
malt
flavors
i
can
make
out
creamy
toffee
and
banana
as
i
swallow
the
bitterness
comes
to
the
forefront
it
is
a
bit
coffeelike
and
tastes
like
it
is
coming
from
the
malts
and
not
from
hops
also
present
in
the
finish
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
it
isnt
burning
but
simply
warming
similar
to
a
quality
aged
whiskey
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
but
feels
lighter
than
it
actually
is
it
has
a
hint
of
creaminess
to
its
consistency
there
is
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
it
gets
to
be
a
bit
too
much
is
a
swish
the
beer
around
in
my
mouth
but
since
i
dont
normally
do
that
i
cant
detract
any
points
for
that
aspect
it
leaves
a
good
coat
but
it
isnt
sticky
at
all
which
i
find
most
impressive
the
coat
feels
slick
without
being
oily
the
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
even
though
it
is
a
strong
lager
i
can
still
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
these
next
time
im
going
to
have
to
purchase
more
than
one
bottle
this
is
a
beer
definitely
worth
seeking
out
dvery
good
not
a
huge
bock
guy
but
this
was
great
super
solid
for
an
extra
d
good
clean
beer
goes
down
very
easily
i
just
dont
think
im
a
big
doppelbock
fan
but
overall
a
good
beer
mfd
very
smooth
the
whole
way
down
carbonation
is
at
a
minimum
but
a
quality
doppelbock
excellent
dopplebock
from
the
nutmeg
state
purcahsed
it
on
a
recomendation
and
i
was
not
let
down
take
some
time
to
smell
the
beverage
immidiately
after
you
open
the
bottle
for
sweet
notes
great
dark
body
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
disperses
realtively
quick
great
spicey
taste
and
ends
with
a
slightly
chocolate
malt
great
beverage
for
any
occasion
d
one
of
the
most
drinkable
big
beers
i
ever
had
drinkability
fantastic
its
like
a
stout
lager
this
will
be
a
regular
d
ive
had
this
twice
now
the
first
from
a
500ml
swingtop
that
looked
like
it
leaked
in
transit
something
wasnt
right
this
review
is
from
a
12oz
bottle
and
while
it
tasted
much
better
im
still
not
convinced
that
this
is
an
a
rated
beer
the
flavors
are
well
integrated
but
the
flavor
picked
up
in
the
nose
that
carries
through
to
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
of
a
turnoff
the
drinkability
is
very
good
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
it
and
would
gladly
drink
this
often
i
thought
it
really
showcases
how
good
malt
flavors
can
really
be
perfectly
definitely
one
of
the
top
of
the
style
that
ive
had
if
not
the
top
overall
a
great
beer
and
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
ill
be
on
the
lookout
for
this
again
got
to
give
it
up
to
hooker
ales
on
this
really
nice
beer
probably
the
best
american
dopplebock
ever
cheers
i
picked
up
a
single
at
pinochios
i
poured
from
a
12ounce
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
dark
opaque
chocolate
in
color
with
a
thick
white
head
the
aroma
is
boozey
and
sweet
with
dark
fruit
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
dark
sweet
plums
and
dates
with
rum
rounding
out
the
flavor
a
candy
like
sweetness
lingers
for
an
eternity
with
each
sip
the
beer
is
full
bodied
thick
and
has
decent
carbonation
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
to
get
more
of
this
one
while
not
one
of
my
go
to
styles
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
liberator
dopplebock
its
pretty
dense
so
i
imagine
id
be
good
with
one
at
a
time
but
i
wouldnt
at
all
mind
drinking
it
again
worth
a
shot
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
brew
ok
to
hunt
down
and
give
a
good
try
if
you
like
the
style
not
super
perfect
personally
but
good
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
nice
big
head
wouldve
never
guessed
it
was
around
4
years
old
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
but
still
nice
looking
the
smell
is
interesting
maybe
not
as
complex
as
a
fresher
version
but
i
get
a
strong
whiff
of
c02
upfront
which
burns
the
nostrils
not
exactly
a
smell
to
c02
but
i
know
the
feeling
followed
by
raisins
powdery
milled
grains
cola
and
a
kind
of
grapey
yeast
smell
nice
smells
but
a
little
subdued
the
taste
was
very
nice
you
start
out
with
a
slight
roastiness
backed
up
with
grapes
or
plums
juicy
and
a
little
sweet
and
theres
a
bit
of
dried
fruit
in
the
yeast
character
as
well
rasins
and
dates
it
is
actually
a
little
more
dry
than
i
was
expecting
but
definitely
sweet
enough
to
be
great
as
it
warms
a
bit
there
are
notes
of
straw
and
dry
chocolate
it
starts
to
get
quite
grainy
too
still
the
grape
juice
flavor
is
noticable
as
well
but
really
the
overriding
flavor
that
i
start
to
notice
is
just
pure
caramel
burnt
sugar
but
kind
of
dry
less
sweet
than
the
real
thing
very
nice
background
for
all
of
the
flavor
and
sometimes
it
leaps
to
the
foreground
keeping
the
whole
thing
quite
complex
a
very
nice
flavor
profile
the
body
is
nice
kind
of
medium
but
thinned
a
little
by
drynes
at
times
quite
lively
carbonation
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
aged
and
i
have
a
2009
that
i
plan
on
drinking
soon
the
complexities
abound
and
i
was
really
glad
to
get
to
try
this
would
definitely
go
for
it
again
nice
full
bodied
mouth
feel
not
syrupy
or
too
heavy
carbonation
is
perfect
great
balance
very
drinkable
beer
good
thing
they
put
this
guy
in
a
4
pack
and
not
a
sixer
because
i
could
drink
these
all
night
makes
me
want
to
try
more
beers
in
this
style
d
great
brew
could
probably
only
drink
2
or
3
of
these
at
a
max
due
to
the
richness
and
thickness
of
the
brew
in
union
with
the
pretty
high
abv
but
i
will
definitely
be
getting
this
again
probably
in
the
fall
or
winter
though
very
stellar
brew
thanks
to
rob
for
hooking
me
up
th
liberator
doppelbock
pours
a
brownamber
color
with
a
solid
head
and
some
decent
lacing
the
aromas
are
not
particularly
strong
but
what
is
there
is
very
inviting
dark
fruits
smoke
subtle
hops
and
malt
are
evident
in
the
nose
and
throughout
the
taste
while
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
i
must
say
this
beer
is
extremely
tasty
and
drinkable
andechser
doppelbock
dunkel
is
the
only
doppelbock
i
have
had
that
i
enjoyed
more
i
will
certainly
seek
this
out
again
th
liberator
doppelbock
is
one
of
the
best
lagers
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
d
i
could
suck
this
down
all
day
d
great
beer
easy
to
drink
love
the
hops
in
this
dopplebock
gives
it
more
flavor
and
more
body
dopplebocks
will
always
have
a
ton
of
malt
flavor
but
this
was
very
nice
and
refreshing
with
the
hops
enjoyed
pretty
tasty
overall
and
nice
and
easy
drinking
overall
a
fantastic
beer
and
representation
of
the
style
i
finshed
my
pint
in
about
three
gulps
now
thats
what
i
call
drinkable
very
happy
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
one
d
very
drinkable
this
was
an
excellent
doppelbock
the
color
of
this
brew
is
a
dark
brownmohogany
with
a
fair
tan
head
and
modest
lacing
the
aroma
is
basically
an
earthy
chocolate
ham
fart
wow
weird
but
strangely
alluring
for
the
male
beer
animal
the
flavor
is
similarly
intense
with
peat
and
swamp
malt
skunk
cabbage
overwhelms
this
oddity
that
tends
more
toward
repugnence
than
desirability
but
its
a
full
bodied
quality
brew
just
the
same
i
get
touches
of
bayberry
and
seaweed
hops
sweet
red
wine
with
nutty
highlights
very
tiny
carbonation
in
this
full
bodied
brew
close
to
being
a
syrupy
brew
not
drinkable
beyond
a
slow
drinker
with
cheese
its
sort
of
nasty
but
flavorful
if
you
can
handle
the
intensity
not
something
that
thrills
me
but
its
an
experience
drinkability
a
really
good
beer
that
is
complex
for
the
style
certainly
one
of
the
better
american
versions
of
this
beer
that
i
have
had
i
could
sit
back
with
several
of
these
in
an
afternoon
d
i
thought
this
was
a
real
nice
doppelbock
i
thought
it
smelled
great
and
that
the
sweet
malts
sugar
and
dark
fruits
smell
and
taste
was
very
enjoyable
would
certainly
try
again
drinkability
suffered
a
bit
in
my
book
due
to
the
thickness
of
the
mouthfeel
still
a
delicious
beer
but
not
something
id
want
more
than
1
or
2
of
in
a
session
d
i
wasnt
expecting
this
to
be
hot
and
hoppy
to
the
extent
that
it
was
it
worked
pretty
well
though
d
a
really
nice
beer
and
one
that
ive
been
looking
forward
to
try
for
quite
awhile
quite
a
lot
of
complexity
and
just
enjoyable
overall
recommended
if
you
like
doppelbocks
my
first
time
having
this
in
the
new
12
oz
format
i
had
it
in
the
swingtop
500ml
about
6
or
7
months
ago
pours
very
dark
barely
seethrough
when
held
up
to
the
light
with
ruby
and
burnt
orange
highlights
has
a
nice
pillowy
beige
head
that
shrinks
down
eventually
becoming
a
bubbly
ring
leaves
very
little
lacing
smell
has
a
nice
chocolate
element
to
it
a
bit
of
breadmolasses
and
dark
fruit
as
well
taste
is
quite
complex
getting
alot
of
toffee
burnt
chocolate
buttery
biscuits
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
bite
a
hint
of
vanilla
sweetness
somewhere
in
there
too
i
may
be
digging
a
bit
deep
now
but
somewhat
of
a
plumred
grape
taste
too
complex
tasty
stuff
not
quite
the
malty
feast
that
the
celebrator
is
mouthfeel
is
good
and
smooth
it
is
a
bit
too
carbonated
and
boozy
at
first
but
that
seems
to
go
away
quickly
a
sweet
dark
rumlike
finish
drinkability
is
good
the
price
for
the
new
4pack
is
a
much
better
deal
than
the
500ml
considering
this
was
a
doppelbock
i
drank
it
quite
fast
very
good
the
hop
presence
is
much
stronger
in
the
nose
and
the
malts
are
much
lighter
still
some
chocolate
and
toffee
but
lighter
the
taste
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
the
malts
the
06
had
the
taste
has
a
ton
of
chocolate
some
roasted
flavors
and
hints
of
toffee
the
malts
are
quite
present
in
the
taste
and
the
chocolate
is
much
stronger
it
is
more
roasty
and
the
hops
are
slightly
more
present
but
not
dominant
like
the
nose
very
good
a
good
bit
of
differences
wish
i
would
have
put
them
up
next
to
each
other
extremely
tasty
both
ways
d
tasty
beer
with
a
ton
of
flavor
i
am
not
usually
a
dopplebock
drinker
but
this
is
one
i
would
certainly
suggest
to
others
d
very
drinkable
at
8
percent
d
if
i
didnt
know
this
was
a
doppelbock
i
would
drink
this
much
faster
than
i
am
now
absolutely
phenomenal

d
damn
good
brew
im
going
to
have
to
trade
for
some
more
of
these
i
could
drink
3
or
4
of
these
and
love
every
sip
12
ounce
bottle
courtesy
of
travduke
poured
into
a
pint
glass
deep
amber
brown
with
a
big
fluffy
tan
head
explosive
tangy
malty
nose
tobacco
leather
slightly
metallic
dark
bread
crust
burnt
caramel
the
flavor
takes
a
second
for
my
palate
to
calibrate
to
but
once
it
does
wow
clearly
unlike
any
other
doppelbock
ashy
and
very
smokey
with
charred
breads
and
sugars
theres
also
somehow
a
solid
fruitiness
midpalate
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
maybe
stone
fruit
how
is
that
in
a
lager
crazy
lowish
carbonation
helps
this
go
down
smooth
as
silk
but
the
finish
is
a
bit
too
astringent
seriously
intriguing
beer
overall
a
style
im
getting
more
and
more
into
and
this
one
isnt
my
favorite
but
it
definitely
represents
the
style
well
and
makes
me
more
of
a
fan
overall
d
a
damn
good
doppelbock
that
deserves
the
high
praise
the
body
is
a
bit
fuller
than
medium
and
carbonation
is
at
normal
levels
for
the
style
this
is
a
nice
brew
that
i
would
like
to
drink
with
a
meal
but
on
its
own
im
not
sure
it
really
separates
itself
from
the
pack
very
good
flavor
lots
of
sweetness
smokey
malts
caramel
notes
carbonation
is
perfect
creamy
complex
heavy
and
solid
mouthfeel
drinks
really
smooth
im
extremely
pleased
with
this
doppelbock
drinkability
well
you
cant
session
this
but
thats
not
what
these
are
made
for
could
i
see
drinking
these
in
lieu
of
food
for
lent
hell
yes
skål
smooth
and
creamy
it
is
the
sort
of
beer
i
find
more
drinkable
in
colder
weather
but
i
am
not
complaining
to
be
enjoying
this
in
relatively
springlike
conditions
right
now
d
well
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
and
i
honestly
tried
this
reluctantly
but
it
was
on
clearance
at
a
local
store
and
figured
if
i
was
ever
going
to
try
this
it
was
now
i
was
expecting
this
wouldnt
hold
up
to
its
rating
for
me
and
id
be
totally
underwhelmed
perhaps
even
being
a
drainpour
in
a
nutshell
i
had
a
negative
attitude
towards
this
beer
so
i
am
very
surprised
to
say
i
really
like
this
beer
a
lot
nice
malty
base
with
enough
roasted
and
bitter
flavors
to
offset
full
bodied
but
not
overpowering
really
nice
glad
i
gave
this
one
a
shot
think
im
going
to
go
back
and
clear
out
the
last
few
bottles
of
this
d
very
balanced
rich
malty
dopplebock
balanced
with
a
hop
backbone
sets
the
bar
for
the
style
steve
d
i
can
only
do
so
much
of
the
straight
malty
stuff
before
i
want
to
move
onto
something
else
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
dont
consider
it
a
great
one
by
any
means
kind
of
surprised
it
rates
as
highly
as
it
does
overall
pretty
disappointed
here
there
wasnt
much
taste
feel
or
complexity
overall
this
is
a
tasty
brew
but
pretty
intense
its
going
to
be
hard
for
me
to
drink
the
whole
thing
d
as
sophisticated
of
a
doppelbock
that
has
ever
crossed
my
lip
a
sipper
not
necessarily
what
i
was
expecting
but
a
very
solid
offering
none
the
less
i
would
gladly
welcome
another
now
i
just
got
a
four
pack
of
this
and
it
is
much
hoppier
than
last
time
it
wouldnt
suprise
me
if
it
was
well
over
60
ibus
their
web
site
says
subtly
hopped
at
24
ibus
why
would
they
change
the
awesome
maltiness
of
this
beer
hooker
has
been
getting
a
lot
of
shit
lately
most
of
it
welldeserved
however
if
they
continue
in
this
direction
i
may
actually
start
working
them
into
my
regular
rotation
again
d
very
drinkable
fairly
complex
yet
nothing
is
too
overpowering
overall
a
nice
balance
that
keeps
me
coming
back
very
good
i
got
to
pick
up
quite
a
few
of
these
good
drinkability
really
solid
doppelbock
overall
probably
would
have
been
even
better
if
it
were
less
aged
d
fantastic
drinks
really
really
well
i
wouldnt
change
a
thing
d
a
very
nice
dopplebock
not
quite
the
depth
of
celebrator
but
perhaps
a
more
accessible
option
that
for
me
would
allow
multiple
servings
in
a
sitting
md
everything
was
mellowed
and
came
together
well
very
deep
and
complex
but
not
overpowering
nervous
about
how
a
doppelbock
aged
but
it
turned
out
fantastic
i
had
heard
about
this
beer
for
quite
some
time
before
it
finally
came
to
florida
i
have
now
tried
several
of
thomas
hookers
beers
and
this
is
the
best
although
the
porter
isnt
far
behind
ive
had
most
of
the
highest
rated
doppels
and
i
would
rate
the
hooker
over
any
except
celebrator
it
has
more
hop
bite
than
any
of
the
german
examples
of
the
style
but
still
retains
the
chocolate
notes
and
body
a
wonderfully
balanced
beer
truly
world
class
the
porter
has
made
it
to
ft
myers
but
ive
only
found
the
doppel
in
the
tampa
area
only
criticisms
are
the
price
and
the
lack
of
a
seal
on
the
flip
top
i
could
buy
several
celebrators
for
the
price
of
one
of
these
so
it
will
have
to
be
an
occasional
treat
a
black
body
with
minimal
head
and
a
light
malty
aroma
of
sweetness
along
with
some
dark
fruits
medium
to
full
body
that
is
this
thick
and
chewey
with
a
sturdy
malt
backbone
that
has
caramel
sweetness
and
hints
of
breadiness
and
chocolate
has
some
dryness
in
the
finish
thanks
to
roasted
malts
and
some
fruity
aftertaste
like
grape
thanks
to
hoppy
bitterness
a
great
dopplebock
to
sip
on
poured
a
dark
mahogany
into
an
american
pint
glass
which
revealed
some
ruby
outlying
color
when
held
up
to
light
one
finger
of
offwhite
spotty
lacing
no
visible
carbonation
the
aroma
was
an
impressive
mix
of
chocolate
toffee
roasted
malt
and
caramel
the
taste
however
seemed
to
reveal
a
little
too
much
roasted
malt
dominance
almost
like
a
burned
piece
of
toast
while
it
was
refreshing
to
experience
a
dopplebock
that
didnt
bleed
sugary
annoyance
the
burnt
toast
flavor
was
a
little
too
much
for
me
the
alcohol
was
wellhidden
i
must
say
but
i
am
unfortunately
at
odds
with
some
of
the
other
reviews
when
i
say
that
the
feel
was
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
relative
to
other
dopples
that
ive
tried
i
finished
the
bottle
but
thats
it
for
me
i
was
a
little
disappointed
after
reading
all
of
the
stellar
reviews
maybe
my
brain
had
just
set
the
bar
too
high
if
i
ever
try
it
again
itll
have
to
be
on
draught
d
if
its
winter
and
i
am
feeling
like
a
vinous
doppelbock
to
warm
me
up
yes
please
i
enjoyed
the
vinous
qualities
of
this
beer
and
it
possesses
a
great
smelling
nose
very
drinkable
the
high
bitterness
is
the
only
thing
that
held
this
beer
back
for
me
other
than
that
on
little
thing
it
was
superb
usual
sweet
caramel
and
raisin
aroma
but
with
heavy
burnt
notes
taste
is
similiarly
roasty
first
with
mild
sweet
caramel
black
cherry
and
driftwood
hops
creamy
as
opposed
to
the
syrupy
sugar
bombs
of
many
doppels
great
stuff
d
well
i
went
ahead
and
ordered
another
one
and
another
for
good
measure
consecration
was
also
on
tap
which
i
love
but
i
still
ordered
more
of
this
it
was
really
good
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
high
so
not
sessionable
but
i
finished
my
pints
with
ease
probably
good
with
some
food
but
good
enough
on
its
own
get
you
some
thanks
conneticutpoet
a
decent
but
clearly
americanized
interpretation
of
ayingers
celebrator
the
roast
flavors
are
a
bit
out
of
place
if
were
talking
about
the
traditional
german
style
i
feel
numb
enough
to
forgive
but
it
just
isnt
as
good
as
i
remember
the
new
guy
fucked
with
it
but
a
little
duct
tape
here
there
might
be
able
to
help
keep
it
together
whatever
connecticut
a
fantastic
beer
great
flavor
mouthfeel
and
a
unique
character
i
like
it

lot

on

not
quite
impenetrable
a
dark
tan

indolently
fades
leaving
some
dots
and
loops
of
lace
behind
smells
grainy
and
sweet
with
some
big

working
through
the

of
it
all
tastes
of
big
sweet
malts
molasses
dark
ripe
fruits
and
a
nice
hint
of
alcohol
heat
on
the
way
down
which
grows
as
the
brew
warms
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
theres
an
openness
in
the
middle
of
the
palate
that
would
make
for
a
very
easy
drinker
here
if
it
wasnt
for
the
aforementioned
alcohol
heat
bold
wellcrafted
hearty
yet
not
too
heavy
excellent
bottled

dark

oh
this
is
good

and
creamy
no
oxidation
this
brew
is
up
there
with
celebrator
toffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
dominate
very
smooth
and
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
top
of
the
line
overall
clearly
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
ive
had
the
taste
was
a
complete
standout
on
this
one
thanks
again
dan
notes
a
really
exceptional
example
of
the
style
as
intended
this
was
brewed
to
have
more
of
a
bread
taste
and
balance
was
the
ultimate
goal
i
say
thank
you
thanks
to
kurt
at
gordons
liquors
in
waltham
who
recommended
this
to
me
drinkability
enjoyed
the
feel
and
the
initial
taste
but
seems
to
have
a
bit
to
crisp
bitterness
of
an
after
taste
d
it
feels
like
an
8
brew
and
the
500ml
bottle
size
ensures
this
is
a
one
and
out
otherwise
it
has
most
of
the
qualities
i
look
for
in
drinkability
mild
aftertaste
and
carbonation
its
an
excellent
american
take
on
the
doppelbock
style
but
isnt
quite
on
par
with
andechser
or
ayinger
probably
the
best
american
attempt
but
still
no
celebrator
great
beer
though
mouthfeel
very
smooth
like
a
celebrator
a
bit
hot
upon
the
first
completed
sip
but
god
damn
good
i
wish
i
could
get
this
around
here
all
in
all
a
great
brew
no
doubt
there
d
very
good
probably
not
a
good
idea
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
one
session
but
a
great
sipper
d
wellbalanced
and
easy
to
knock
back
i
wish
this
were
a
beer
sold
out
here
on
the
west
coast
d
i
enjoyed
sipping
this
one
until
the
glass
was
empty
im
not
extremely
familiar
with
the
doppelbock
style
but
this
isnt
my
first
i
was
surprised
not
to
find
the
typical
ripe
banana
and
spice
flavors
but
that
being
said
i
thought
that
the
flavor
profile
was
great
and
mouthfeel
was
like
that
of
an
imperial
stout
pleasure
to
drink
d
not
exactly
a
session
beer
but
liberator
doppelbock
is
a
nice
sipper
that
is
recommended
d
joe
i
owe
you
big
time
for
this
one
this
absolutely
deserves
all
of
the
high
ratings
its
gotten
on
this
site
drinkability
okay
the
flatness
is
very
distracting
for
this
beer
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
top
notch
for
a
doppelbock
a
sure
winner
will
revisit
again
purchased
at
jessup
beverage
half
liter
swingtop
poured
into
my
20
ounce
dimpled
mug
appears
a
clear
deep
chestnut
brown
color
with
about
an
inch
of
light
tan
foam
the
head
lingers
for
a
few
minutes
before
settling
into
a
thin
layer
a
nice
looking
pour
smells
and
tastes
of
sweet
caramelized
malts
toffee
mild
chocolate
bread
and
figs
very
pleasant
roastiness
to
this
one
a
notch
above
medium
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
check
this
one
out
if
you
can
the
empty
bottles
also
make
great
mini
growlers
a
very
tasty
beer
different
from
german
doppelbocks
in
that
there
is
a
more
roasty
and
chocolate
malt
profile
in
this
beer
compared
to
the
more
bready
malt
bombs
in
europe
at
times
i
thought
i
was
drinking
a
stout
lager
a
schwarzbier
maybe
who
knows
doesnt
matter
a
great
beer
d
could
have
a
few
for
sure
great
creamy
and
thick
texture
alcohol
is
evident
but
not
offensive
overall
character
of
the
beer
is
very
impressive
d
drinkability
is
good
the
flavors
come
together
to
make
a
very
appealing
beer
feel
is
light
and
smooth
even
though
the
alcohol
is
present
all
through
this
beer
it
acts
more
as
a
compliment
to
everything
else
that
is
going
on
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
easily
recommemded
brew
for
the
style
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
alcohol
covered
enough
giving
just
a
touch
of
warmth
but
not
sharp
in
the
least
very
drinkable
malty
rich
but
with
a
nice
hop
balance
i
was
expecting
liberator
doppelbock
to
be
excellent
beer
that
it
is
indeed
it
has
absolutely
no
material
flaws
its
packed
with
flavor
and
depth
im
super
impressed
with
this
beer
it
truly
is
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
out
there
perhaps
i
should
say
its
easily
among
if
the
top
doppelbock
ive
ever
tried
certainly
one
that
every
ba
should
seek
out
i
originally
bought
this
beer
to
marinade
meat
in
but
that
would
definitely
be
a
crime
a
simply
fantastic
beer
its
a
shame
this
one
is
so
oxidized
i
would
love
to
try
it
fresh
because
i
can
see
it
being
great
drinkability
never
really
ventured
into
doppelbocks
but
im
glad
i
did
this
brew
is
excellent
especially
the
way
the
maltiness
is
placed
in
here
its
not
overbarring
with
sugar
and
it
has
alot
of
character
to
keep
me
interested
well
done
this
is
a
good
doppelbock
but
its
certainly
not
as
good
as
i
expected
this
bottle
may
have
been
a
little
oxidized
so
i
may
try
and
find
a
fresh
bottle
to
review
d
glad
i
got
to
try
this
id
probably
give
it
another
go
5
years
from
now
to
see
what
the
infection
has
done
to
it
but
not
at
the
cost
of
a
slot
in
my
cellar
im
guessing
that
this
ones
an
acquired
taste
more
like
a
dark
belgian
sour
than
a
dopplebock
but
still
its
welldone
thanks
to
grandq
for
my
oppertunity
to
try
it
d
an
exceptional
dopplebock
that
presents
a
robust
earthy
flavor
profile
with
the
cloying
sweetness
that
can
plague
this
style
well
worth
seeking
out
and
a
great
christmas
eve
treat
mouthfeel
is
a
creamy
texture
and
slightly
sticky
very
interesting
and
perfect
for
a
cold
night
surely
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
out
there
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
try
one
if
you
can
poured
a
500ml
swing
top
bottle
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
murky
turbid
cola
brown
with
a
smooth
meringueesque
beige
head
that
didnt
stick
around
and
left
no
lacing
while
no
lacing
was
present
this
beer
left
huge
oily
legs
when
swirled
the
aroma
is
just
a
big
malt
bomb
biscuit
roasted
toasted
any
type
of
malt
but
the
aroma
is
not
sweet
and
syrupy
at
all
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
malts
being
the
main
flavor
with
raisins
brown
sugar
and
other
dark
fruits
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
leaving
a
good
malty
flavor
on
the
palate
this
is
a
great
beer
i
can
see
why
its
so
highly
regarded
i
would
love
to
get
a
earlier
vintage
of
this
beer
mouthfeel
was
mild
carbonation
and
smooth
medium
bodied
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
i
appreciate
the
complexity
of
this
beer
d
nice
drinkability
and
really
enjoyable
flavor
for
a
double
bock

i
cant
even
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
but
its
apparent
once
a
bottle
this
big
is
finally
savored
to
the
very
end
the
caramel
sweetness
albiet
in
a
fermented
form
has
coated
my
mouth
nicely
as
the
last
few
sips
remain
in
my
glass
this
is
one
impressive
beer
and
drinking
experience
kudos
for
thomas
hooker
for
the
best
bock
ive
ever
tasted
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
thick
foamy
tan
head
aroma
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
toffee
and
caramel
flavor
is
very
malty
with
hints
of
chocolate
caramel
toffee
and
fig
extremely
smooth
rich
and
creamy
beer
excellent
this
is
a
standout
beer
that
is
excellent
for
style
overall
very
very
tasty
with
very
good
drinkability
but
im
going
to
take
my
sweet
ass
time
finishing
this
bottle
this
is
quite
the
doppelbock
no
wonder
its
on
the
best
of
ba
list
thanks
again
alan
overall
this
certainly
lives
up
to
its
billing
thus
far
its
the
best
doppelbock
ive
ever
had
very
smooth
very
complex
very
worth
a
shot
notes
on
election
day
whats
better
than
being
truly
liberated
arguably
the
best
dopplebock
going
overall
yuck
this
is
different
than
any
doppelbock
ive
had
previously
as
the
smoky
and
cocoa
flavors
along
with
the
hoppiness
replace
the
typical
caramel
maltiness
without
much
more
to
it
i
like
it
drinkability
damn
tasty
and
damn
drinkable
what
keeps
it
from
a
5
0
are
the
unusuallyhighforthestyle
abv
but
what
keeps
it
above
a
4
0
my
usual
score
for
a
beer
that
has
an
unusuallyhighforthestyle
abv
is
the
fantastic
way
in
which
it
is
hidden
a
crisp
clean
refreshing
balanced
beer
and
probably
the
best
doppelbock
ive
ever
had
kudos
to
thomas
hooker
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
from
the
side
dark
amber
from
the
top
smells
heavily
of
sweet
roasted
malt
and
caramel
alcohol
very
noticeable
along
with
the
malt
delicious
sweet
yet
balanced
blend
i
live
near
hooker
so
i
may
be
bias
but
this
is
quite
the
doppel
d
could
drink
two
12ozs
and
be
happy
two
pints
would
be
a
little
much
a
nice
robust
dark
malt
and
sour
flavor
this
has
a
mildly
thick
body
and
a
clean
finish
this
get
sourerer
as
it
warms
up
and
gets
beter
this
is
a
nice
earthey
brown
like
fresh
tilled
upstate
new
york
soil
is
very
cloudy
i
would
like
to
try
one
fresh
one
for
comparason
mine
was
a
2006
and
i
was
glad
to
have
all
of
the
one
that
made
it
to
me
leaked
in
shiping
md
creamy
full
bodied
mouthfeel
excellent
tasting
beer
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
that
holds
a
nice
cap
as
the
beer
is
drank
and
leaves
some
lace
the
aroma
is
full
of
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
unlike
what
you
would
expect
from
most
doppelbocks
it
is
up
front
with
a
roasty
chocolatyness
that
provides
somewhat
of
a
bitter
balance
to
the
massive
caramel
sweetness
that
follows
the
body
is
full
with
a
medium
carbonation
level
overall
the
bitter
roasted
grains
make
this
a
more
drinkable
doppelbock
than
most
still
a
sipping
beer
to
enjoy
occasionally
great
brew
tremendous
d
a
good
sipper
thats
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
that
ive
had
its
one
that
id
love
to
have
again
d
itll
be
coming
to
get
you
with
that
hidden
alcohol
but
theres
no
problem
putting
back
a
bomber
of
this
and
perhaps
even
crave
another
a
very
nice
brew
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
look
forward
to
the
other
in
a
couple
months
perhaps
with
good
company
dtasty
and
drinkable
i
think
the
8
is
perfect
its
just
high
enough
to
enjoy
it
slowly
d
usually
drinking
a
doppelbock
is
like
arm
wrestling
a
one
armed
man
addicted
to
masturbation
you
know
you
are
fighting
a
loosing
battle
while
not
as
malty
as
other
beers
in
the
style
it
is
good
i
think
this
bottle
was
showing
some
signs
of
going
downhill
if
you
have
the
2006
bottling
drink
it
up
now
roasted
malts
and
herbal
hop
bitterness
up
front
sweet
vinous
fruits
on
the
edges
of
the
palate
caramel
and
bread
pudding
maltiness
fill
up
the
middle
aggressive
hop
profile
takes
over
herbal
and
bitter
especially
for
the
style
more
roasted
coffee
bitterness
and
some
dark
chocolate
in
the
finish
slightly
warming
fullbodied
with
an
almost
chewy
feel
smooth
velvety
carbonation
very
well
done
on
the
hoppy
side
for
a
doppelbock
but
this
is
delicious
d
definitely
a
brew
that
ill
take
my
time
with
though
i
keep
coming
back
for
it
i
believe
the
bottle
was
about
8
thats
pretty
crazy
i
could
get
down
on
these
pretty
heavily
on
a
cooler
autumn
eve
t
full
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
with
very
little
carbonation
but
a
slight
hop
bite
body
is
a
very
nice
tasty
malt
and
biscuit
mix
slightly
sweet
but
not
overpowering
alcohol
is
also
present
in
the
finish
in
a
good
warming
way
without
much
burn
malt
taste
is
dry
and
roasted
and
finishes
very
clean
with
a
lingering
coffee
groundbread
taste
overall
pretty
amazing
lately
i
had
been
down
on
dopplebocks
but
this
broke
that
trend
poured
from
this
years
funky
flip
top
bottle
to
a
chimay
goblet
good
looking
dark

hazy
beer
with

of
roasted
malts
maybe
some
chocolate
or
espresso
notes
smooth
rich

flavor
stays
with
your
taste
buds
for
a
while
not
my
fave
style
but
extremely
drinkable
for
a

very
tasty
beer
3
for
the
best
doppelbock
on
ba
it
standsat
a
good
3
tasted
from
a
2006
bottle
on
a
wet
spring
day
deep
brown
in
color
little
to
no
head
that
quickly
vanished
interesting
aroma
of
pears
and
tart
fruit
tastes
smokey
and
bitter
with
sweetness
hiding
in
the
background
alcohol
is
present
as
the
beer
warms
to
room
temperature
on
the
nose
and
taste
smooth
and
full
of
body
thick
on
the
tongue
a
nice
sipper
on
the
perfect
day
for
it
very
nice
pours
dark
brown
with
a
minimal
head
strong
aroma
of
caramel
nuts
and
toffee
smells
absolutely
delicious
taste
of
toffee
and
caramel
with
notes
of
vanilla
gently
rolling
to
a
lasting
bitter
finish
very
thick
mouthfeel
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
drinkability
its
too
bad
theyre
not
going
to
bottle
this
delicious
doppelbock
any
more
i
know
theyre
still
going
to
have
this
beer
ontap
but
thats
probalby
going
to
be
at
a
few
select
beer
bars
its
one
of
the
best
tasting
doppelbocks
ive
had
so
far
its
one
doppelbock
you
have
to
try
to
believe
its
a
great
beer
just
very
undoppelbock
like
very
bitter
very
hoppy
and
tons
of
roasted
malt
its
big
but
mild
earth
german
malt
touches
its
just
big
in
places
a
doppel
bock
shouldnt
be
despite
the
shortcomings
outlined
below
this
was
a
damn
tastey
beer
id
just
like
to
see
less
acidic
characteristics
and
less
bittering
at
the
finish
my
reviews
are
usually
pretty
consistent
with
the
consensus
but
this
one
im
sure
is
going
to
be
way
off
the
mark
did
i
get
a
bad
bottle
maybe
but
its
hard
to
say
for
sure
guess
ill
have
to
revisit
to
find
out
an
inch
and
a
half
of
very
active
speckled
bubbles
are
a
nice
dark
brownish
tan
in
color
you
would
expect
dark
brown
body
but
what
you
get
is
a
jet
black
body
nose
has
high
amounts
of
minerals
and
spicey
sweet
malt
dark
fruits
and
a
hint
of
roasted
toffee
there
are
even
some
soured
fruit
notes
as
i
take
first
sip
i
am
taken
by
the
uniqueness
of
this
flavor
profile
you
get
an
initial
burnt
malt
sweetness
and
toffee
richness
this
is
followed
by
a
candied
apple
feel
with
hints
of
carmel
and
sour
fruit
the
spice
line
on
this
beer
is
complex
and
well
balanced
with
a
just
right
mixture
of
sweet
rich
sour
and
bitter
the
bitter
feeel
comes
in
the
form
of
crisp
burnt
feel
on
the
finish
nice
belly
warmer
with
very
well
hidden
alchol
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
complex
all
in
itself
as
you
would
expect
lovely
drinkable
unique
this
is
a
substantial
beer
no
matter
how
you
analyze
it
it
pours
a
very
dark
almost
inky
brown
that
doesnt
emit
much
clearness
even
held
up
to
the
daylight
there
is
a
slightly
bubbly
slightly
creamy
brownish
head
to
this
beer
if
you
want
to
force
it
out
of
the
bottle
poured
carefully
the
beer
doesnt
have
all
that
much
of
a
head
there
is
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
there
isnt
much
carbonation
to
this
very
full
bodied
beer
and
the
smell
is
all
about
the
sweet
malts
im
picking
up
some
chalkiness
in
the
aroma
along
with
caramel
nut
flavors
butterscotchtoffee
and
maybe
the
barest
hint
of
heavy
fruit
the
taste
is
quite
creamy
dense
wonderfully
malty
caramel
some
burnt
brown
sugars
some
roasted
grains
some
huskiness
as
well
there
is
a
slight
bite
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
with
this
beer
and
i
knocked
the
drinkability
down
a
point
as
a
result
overall
this
beer
evinces
lots
of
creaminess
in
the
mouth
the
8
abv
is
pretty
well
hidden
in
the
overall
character
of
the
beer
the
aftertaste
doesnt
have
a
throaty
alcohol
presence
but
there
still
is
that
partly
sourish
partly
biting
characteristic
on
the
back
end
that
diminishes
things
ever
so
slightly
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
well
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
big
tan
head
the
aroma
is
surprisingly
mild
with
a
touch
of
creamy
candy
spice
and
malts
the
flavor
has
a
slight
smoked
character
than
blends
wonderfully
in
the
aftertaste
with
herbal
earthy
hops
the
bulk
of
the
flavor
is
rich
but
smooth
german
malt
meaty
and
bready
theres
a
touch
of
cardboard
from
oxidation
and
sour
tang
from
bacteria
but
thats
expected
and
doesnt
really
detract
from
the
flavor
all
in
all
a
very
different
doppelbock
but
tasty
interesting
and
ridiculously
drinkable
yum
notes
a
beer
with
unusual
character
i
found
it
difficult
to
accurately
describe
or
get
a
feel
for
from
reading
other
peoples
notes
d
this
is
a
brew
to
sip
and
enjoy
in
moderate
volumes
great
desert
beer
or
one
to
enjoy
late
at
night
while
sitting
in
front
of
a
fireplace
overall
i
was
happy
to
see
that
this
one
lived
up
to
the
hype
it
was
wonderfully
rich
filling
and
just
fantastic
i
have
no
idea
what
the
age
did
to
it
but
if
it
was
detrimental
i
would
love
to
see
what
this
could
do
fresh
really
a
very
high
quality
brew
and
for
the
style
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
i
have
had
definitely
tops
in
terms
of
smoothness
for
sure
i
f
you
can
get
it
seek
it
out
you
need
to
try
this
one
edit
hooker
is
bottling
this
doppelbock
still
but
in
limited
quantities
at
a
higher
price
due
to
new
ownershipbrewmaster
first
beer
i
have
tasted
from
this

impressed
overall
similar
quality
of

dopplebock
deserves
its
high
rating
recommended
to
anybody
than
is
a
fan
of
this
beer
style
d
very
solid
doppelbock
one
i
wish
i
could
more
easily
obtain
wouldnt
consider
it
an
everyday
beer
more
of
a
cooleveningfinisher
a
very
excellent
doppelbock
on
almost
all
aspects
liberator
is
the
prototypical
doppelbock
theres
a
reason
why
it
is
found
in
the
top
100
embodies
everything
you
would
expect
in
a
classic
doppel

dark

the
powerful

chocolate
coffee
caramel
burnt

not
a
session
beer
but
a
good
winter
drink
bottled

2006
very
nice
deep
garnet
color
not
a
lot
of

was
almost

damn
fine
us
version
of
a
doppelbock
really
a
great
beer
id
stack
this
against
a
german
version
any
day
drinkability
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
just
the
right
amount
of
everything
roasted
maltiness
caramel
sweetness
bitterness
and
smooth
creaminess
an
excellent
brew
since
this
brew
is
seasonal
and
ive
just
polished
off
my
2006
stock
what
a
wonderful
thing
to
look
forward
to
spring
flowers
birds
chirping
and
more
hooker
liberator
doppel
bock
d
frankly
this
didnt
make
me
want
to
go
looking
for
more
of
this
beer
like
many
of
the
others
ive
had
it
was
an
expansion
of
my
taste
base
but
i
would
probably
pass
on
it
were
it
offered
again
not
as
good
as
the
previous
bottles
ive
tried
a
little
more
of
an
alcohol
kick
than
i
would
expect
for
an
8
brew
ill
score
it
fair
from
past
experience
id
love
to
see
another
one
of
these
come
my
way
for
a
rereview
the
2006
hinged
bottle
poured
a
jet
black
into
a
thomas
hooker
glass
the
wonderful
off
white
head
lasts
a
long
time
and
thins
out
to
a
thick
lace
aromas
of
malts
bread
molasses
along
with
a
nice
flora
hop
note
once
it
warms
a
bit
the
palette
on
this
is
excellent
thick
and
creamy
not
to
much
carbonation
flavors
of
toasted
malts
sweetness
almost
but
just
enough
bitter
to
balance
this
perfectly
this
is
a
great
doppelbock
one
can
only
hope
they
dont
mess
up
this
recipe
i
will
be
going
back
for
more
the
palate
is
overwhelmingly
toasted
malts
very
rich
but
surprisingly
crisp
nice
warming
quality
though
for
a
beer
at
8
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
too
burnt
but
still
incredibly
drinkable
very
impressed
with
this
one
i
feel
honored
to
have
this
made
virtually
in
my
own
back
yard
right
here
in
connecticut
anyone
want
to
send
me
another
bottle
drinkability
when
i
first
took
a
sip
of
this
beauty
it
really
reminded
me
of
a
winterfest
brew
that
is
made
by
a
local
brewpub
this
one
remains
sweet
while
not
being
cloying
and
is
really
well
balanced
full
of
huge
flavors
and
a
super
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
hell
of
a
beer
to
drink
on
christmas
eve
and
im
glad
i
picked
this
one
big
thanks
again
to
gpcollen1
this
is
very
drinkable
its
so
good
you
stretch
it
with
sips
but
you
could
gulp
it
if
you
had
another
one
waiting
in
the
wings
very
rich
a
keeper
md
creamy
yet
light
on
the
palate
highly
drinkable
each
quaff
invites
the
next
this
was
good
but
it
wasnt
he
lifechaning
beer
experience
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
well
i
guess
im
just
not
a
big
fan
of
doppelbocks
it
doesnt
make
any
sense
i
know
i
like
regular
bocks
i
like
intense
burny
stouts
that
taste
kind
of
like
paint
thinner
why
should
i
be
turned
off
by
the
burny
malt
of
dopplebocks
i
dunno
i
dont
dislike
them
and
this
is
certainly
a
finely
crafted
beer
pours
a
dark
murky
brown
to
black
with
a
nice
size
light
tan
head
smell
is
a
nice
clean
lager
aroma
sweet
brown
sugar
maltiness
sweet
grapiness
as
well
as
a
spicy
aroma
of
roastiness
and
hints
of
alcohol
taste
follows
the
aroma
with
a
nice
brown
sugar
maltiness
and
roasted
malts
decent
grassy
and
pine
hop
bite
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
fairly
high
level
of
carbonations
is
lively
on
the
tongue
along
with
a
pepperiness
from
the
hops
finishes
dry
fairly
hoppy
and
not
quite
as
malty
as
i
expected
but
this
kept
it
well
balanced
and
made
it
easy
to
finish
the
bottle
very
fine
sipping
ale
i
have
to
try
this
fresh
this
awesome
looking
500ml
swing
top
bottle
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
beer
with
a
smallish
tight
bubbled
head
that
sticks
nicely
the
smell
is
very
appealing
both
malty
ranging
from
biscuity
malt
to
chocolate
malts
in
the
middle
to
some
roasted
darker
malts
with
a
touch
of
burnt
malt
in
there
as
well
there
is
also
a
fair
touch
of
fruit
in
the
nose
raisins
and
plums
come
to
mind
the
taste
is
also
very
nice
dominated
by
the
malts
nice
full
maltiness
without
it
being
heavy
a
little
sweet
up
front
but
finishes
roasty
and
burnt
with
a
lingering
burnt
grain
bitterness
a
lot
of
chocolate
in
there
throughout
hidden
fruitiness
in
the
back
adds
a
pleasant
balance
but
remains
light
enough
to
let
the
grain
do
all
the
talking
hops
are
minimal
providing
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
that
is
almost
indiscernible
from
the
bitter
grain
and
it
is
really
only
in
there
to
balance
the
malt
which
it
does
nicely
fairly
low
carbonation
combined
with
great
lager
smoothness
make
this
beer
feel
light
on
the
tongue
really
pretty
amazing
for
a
beer
of
this
girth
very
good
stuff
here
enough
going
on
to
hold
anyones
interest
yet
dangerously
smooth
and
drinkable
this
stuff
is
world
class
d
very
easy
to
drink
would
like
to
have
this
one
again
pours
an
opaque
almost
black
brown
with
a
finger
of
creamy
head
and
lacing
throughout
smells
of
sour
fruit
plum
black
licorice
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
taste
is
mostly
of
tart
plumfruit
and
a
licorice
aftertaste
identical
to
the
smell
and
with
its
very
mild
chocolate
taste
this
reminds
me
of
a
mild
earthmonk
medium
in
the
mouth
and
very
smooth
drinkability
is
limited
by
the
odd
tartness
aftertaste
is
clean
and
fresh
got
this
from
somebody
i
know
from
a
certain
local
location
i
promised
to
keep
my
mouth
shut
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
color
smells
is
of
old
sour
fruits
taste
is
the
same
lots
of
old
sour
fruits
mixed
with
lots
of
malty
sweetness
spices
and
a
bit
of
lingering
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
thin
mouthfeel
overall
it
was
good
but
i
was
not
blown
away
maybe
it
isnt
my
style
at
this
moment
but
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
this
since
it
is
hard
to
find
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
thank
you
mystery
person
i
know
who
supplied
me
with
this
he
did
not
want
to
be
identified
yum
a
500ml
swing
top
bottle
opens
with
a
olfactory
smacking
pop
an
exceptional
smell
of
strong
roasted
malts
a
hearty
head
forms
and
lasts
the
taste
is
closing
in
on
perfection
with
an
amazing
sweet
malt
vanguard
and
a
slight
bitter
tailing
a
wonderful
doppelbock
which
should
never
be
passed
on
if
the
opportunity
presents
enjoy
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
all
the
benefits
of
a
lager
ie
crispness
and
clear
taste
with
all
the
oomph
of
a
stout
ie
extreme
malts
and
smokiness
pours
an
almost
black
body
which
allows
just
the
hint
of
light
through
the
head
leaves
me
hanging
a
bit
but
retention
is
nice
even
the
most
casual
sniff
reveals
the
strong
malts
and
hops
that
went
into
this
brew
upon
taking
a
sip
the
taste
reveals
the
malts
but
more
importantly
the
dominant
hoppy
flavor
that
defies
the
normal
scale
of
evaluation
for
doppelbocks
the
beer
retains
most
of
its
crispness
but
loses
a
bit
of
the
edge
as
you
finish
overall
the
hands
down
the
best
dopplebock
i
have
ever
had
although
i
havent
had
very
many
the
bitterness
blends
well
with
the
malt
you
would
expect
a
bitter
flavor
at
the
end
but
it
goes
does
so
smooth
id
like
to
see
how
the
oak
aging
flavors
this
but
it
is
definitely
excellent
as
is
man
what
a
treat
thank
god
liberator
night
is
finally
here
whens
the
next
one
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
dark
roasted
malts
and
a
dry
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
very
smooth
roasted
and
black
malt
flavor
that
is
rich
yet
easy
drinking
it
goes
down
with
ease
and
finishes
warm
with
some
residual
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
dryness
at
the
end
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
just
another
outstanding
beer
from
hooker
its
solid
and
well
brewed
a
fine
drinker
d
a
fine
example
of
a
dopplebock
that
goes
down
way
too
easy
good
but
not
andechser
quality
seems
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
the
style
but
i
like
it
that
way
that
was
a
sexy
beer
a
burlesque
beer
it
always
leaves
a
little
to
the
imagination
in
that
it
doesnt
show
you
everything
immediately
but
rather
gypsy
rose
lee
style
slowly
reveals
almost
everything
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
yes
i
would
love
another
of
these
an
excellent
beer
that
is
very
well
crafted
and
shares
the
mouthfeel
qualities
of
their
incredible
porter
this
would
be
dead
on
with
a
great
steak
prepared
simply
or
even
some
just
slightly
spiced
beef
dishes
and
could
probably
do
well
with
a
nice
soft
albeit
mild
stinky
cheese
this
would
be
a
great
friday
night
lights
low
smooth
jazz
high
beer
and
i
think
i
will
make
a
date
for
some
friday
in
the
future
to
do
just
that
a
great
beer
and
highly
recommended
its
dense
complex
blended
and
an
absolutely
testament
to
artisanal
craftmanship
if
i
could
change
one
thing
it
would
be
the
swimming
head
that
sneaks
up
after
just
one
bottle
because
a
second
would
be
double
the
pleasure
enough
cliches
this
is
why
hundreds
of
years
ago
man
discovered
how
to
malt
and
roast
barley
drinkability
is
good
its
a
bit
heavy
to
an
every
day
drinker
but
its
still
an
exceptional
beer
that
deserves
the
high
marks
it
receives
here
a
500ml
swing
top
bottle
the
tape
on
the
top
said
bottled
in
2006
it
sat
in
my
cellar
for
a
couple
weeks
and
was
poured
into
a
pilsener
glass
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
red
highlights
it
had
a
medium
tan
head
with
a
little
lacing
aroma
was
mostly
roasted
malt
and
caramel
with
a
hint
of
fruit
coffeeespresso
taste
as
well
as
dark
chocolate
and
some
the
aforementioned
fruit
very
rich
big
mouthful
wonderful
wonderful
beer
a
dark
sully
brown
colour
no
transparency
a
bubbly
slightly
off
white
head
that
mostly
fades
out
a
malty
aroma
with
notes
of
grapes
roast
and
caramel
to
this
point
the
appearance
and
the
aroma
have
disappointed
the
flavour
on
the
other
hand
seems
to
offer
up
something
special
notes
of
great
chocolate
anise
licorice
and
various
malts
nothing
seems
to
stick
out
and
no
aspects
seem
to
come
together
i
dont
get
any
depth
i
dont
taste
any
complexities
im
sorry
to
say
but
terribly
disappoints
thanks
again
ben
this
beer
is
a
deep
brown
color
with
minimal
head
the
smell
is
liqorice
chocolate
and
smoke
the
smokiness
shows
in
the
taste
and
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
ting
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
the
rich
flavors
giving
this
beer
a
nice
aftertaste
the
drinkability
is
good
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
after
a
morning
of
fighting
a
brush
fire
thanks
to
prufrock
for
the
bottle
lovely
stuff
overall
i
was
not
impressed
by
this
beer
perhaps
it
was
old
it
was
a
2006
but
even
so
im
accustomed
to
doppelbocks
having
a
much
sweeter
profile
than
this
beer
did
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
was
quite
expensive
i
paid
9
for
the
bottle
and
i
dont
think
it
was
worth
the
price
bottom
line
id
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
drinkability
quite
drinkable
im
getting
a
bit
of
a
burn
from
the
8
abv
but
its
not
distracting
thanks
much
to
blitz134
for
this
opportunity
mmm
so
smooth
and
so
drinkable
luscious
and
full
bodied
with
a
smokiness
that
goes
pow
in
your
face
but
then
rescinds
to
the
background
as
one
gets
used
to
it
dark
malts
and
dark
fruits
toast
and
butter
coffee
nuts
and
chocolate
perfectly
balanced
i
dont
know
what
more
to
say
about
this
beer
other
then
that
it
is
nearly
perfect
i
love
it
many
thanks
to
scthaden
for
the
trade
d
im
not
crazy
about
this
beer
it
has
too
much
roasted
malt
that
creates
too
much
astringency
and
bitterness
poured
into
a
chalice
a
nice
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
an
an
amazing
creamy
onefinger
plus
tan
head
which
lasted
forever
now
some
nice
little
islands
and
sticky
lacing
throughout
the
drink
the
nose
is
of
sweet
malts
vanilla
and
toffeecaramel
the
taste
is
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
malts
nice
touch
of
vanilla
lots
of
toffeecaramel
medium
body
smooththick
with
a
nice
chewy
body
very
drinkable
man
this
is
an
awesome
doppelbock
probably
the
best
ive
had
to
date
quite
different
highly
recommended
cheers
im
not
a
big
fan
of
doppelbocks
in
general
but
this
is
certainly
right
up
there
with
autumnal
fire
for
the
best
ive
encountered
worthy
of
the
praise
bestowed
upon
it
this
is
a
favorite
style
of
mine
and
an
excellent
version
of
that
style
d
all
around
this
is
a
solid
beer
definitely
a
must
try
a
nice
dopplebock
and
decidedly
drinkable
a
few
more
ibus
than
i
anticipated
but
a
rather
nice
variation
of
the
style
poured
out
a
very
dark
mahogony
brown
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
the
nose
has
lots
of
fresh
grain
some
coffee
alcohol
and
light
sour
cherryfruit
punch
the
taste
starts
mellow
chocolate
then
builds
to
thick
creamy
coffee
and
a
maple
syrup
like
malty
goodness
the
alcohol
is
expertly
hidden
and
the
complexity
of
flavors
layers
nicely
one
on
top
of
the
other
they
truly
cascade
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
the
drinkability
is
phenomonal
for
such
a
big
boy
the
darkness
of
the
brew
does
not
convey
its
clarity
on
the
tongue
very
well
developed
malt
aromas
and
flavors
chocolate
dark
fruits
some
hints
of
smokiness
all
very
much
separated
not
jumbled
together
the
huge
malt
presence
wasnt
overly
sweet
but
the
body
was
somewhat
watery
for
my
taste
in
this
style
nice
finish
wish
there
was
just
a
little
more
hops
on
the
end
not
over
the
top
like
some
domestic
bocks
and
a
great
intro
beautiful
dark
redbrown
with
a
nice
thick
off
white
head
smells
of
buscuits
and
bread
the
taste
was
very
nice
up
front
malt
like
whole
grain
bread
but
slightly
sweet
a
little
caramel
and
chocolate
mixed
in
slight
tinge
of
hops
at
the
finish
this
one
was
thick
but
smooth
and
creamy
at
the
same
time
a
bit
dry
and
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
warmth
after
sipping
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
big
and
sturdy
yet
easy
to
drink
at
the
same
time
ill
have
to
scoop
up
some
more
to
hoard
for
the
upcoming
summer
months
feel
medium
to
full
this
one
was
a
bit
heftier
and
substantial
than
the
ayinger
dopple
which
preceded
it
great
american
version
of
this
classic
a
true
pleasure
an
enjoyable
beer
for
sure
easy
to
drink
despite
its
relative
bigness
a
little
surprising
bitterness
for
a
malt
dominated
style
was
interesting
but
well
done
in
the
beer
d
very
good
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
d
good
beer
but
isnt
living
up
to
the
reputation
in
my
mind
but
i
will
go
as
far
to
say
that
its
the
best
domestic
doppel
on
the
market
i
enjoyed
it
but
germany
outshines
tremendously
cheers
pours
very
dark
brown
a
tight
white
head
dissapates
quickly
but
reforms
after
each
of
the
first
23
sips
smells
cool
and
hoppy
right
after
the
pour
hoppin
ess
is
unexpected
after
warming
a
bit
it
gets
more
of
a
sweet
malty
odor
some
alcohol
on
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
absolutely
perfectly
delicious
completely
smooth
tangy
malt
with
noble
the
noblest
hops
and
a
slightly
sweet
roastiness
some
ethyl
alcohol
hidden
way
way
back
beneatht
he
layers
as
it
warms
it
gets
a
bitterness
not
unlike
a
double
ipa
interesting
really
tastes
like
a
fresh
pour
from
a
tap
which
is
a
nice
sensation
overall
truely
a
tremendous
dopplebock
though
a
bit
outside
the
box
perhaps
im
really
impressed
though
especially
with
the
way
the
built
the
hop
character
drinkability
very
pleasant
stuff
extremely
fullbodied
and
flavorful
the
nose
underwhelms
me
a
bit
relative
to
the
flavor
but
i
still
enjoy
it
thoroughly
dark
black
color
with
only
a
bit
of
transparency
about
the
edges
not
much
head
but
a
nice
frothy
ring
remains
the
aroma
is
a
nice
clean
bouquet
of
dark
fruit
licorice
and
chocolate
not
very
potent
though
the
flavor
is
a
nice
and
tangy
mix
of
nutty
chocolate
and
raisin
plus
a
decent
amount
of
hop
bitterness
rich
and
smooth
mouthfeel
solid
carbonation
i
really
like
this
beer
although
its
not
much
of
a
dopplebock
its
excellent
because
of
the
nice
balance
between
the
sweet
and
bitter
flavors
thanks
to
skinnyelvis
for
the
bottles
pleasant
carbonation
with
a
slight
sticky
finish
which
is
always
going
to
accompany
this
style
on
a
cold
january
night
its
close
to
perfect
highly
recommended
overall
a
great
american
dopple
i
have
two
more
bottles
that
will
be
sitting
for
at
least
another
year
and
hopefully
i
can
keep
one
for
2
years
provided
i
dont
break
down
and
drink
it
cheers
beertracker
d
this
is
an
excellent
doppelbock
full
of
malty
strength
and
subtle
flavors
it
is
certainly
up
there
with
weihenstephanes
korbinian
in
my
book
quite
drinkable
thing
is
this
doesnt
really
taste
like
a
bock
it
tastes
like
a
sweet
stout
not
that
is
bad
but
not
what
i
expected
still
this
is
way
easy
to
drink
truly
an
exceptional
dopplebock
pours
very
dark
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
good
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
as
well
smells
of
wine
and
chocolate
and
some
orange
citrus
taste
is
phenomenal
bitter
chocolate
orange
rich
malt
and
incredibly
creamy
nice
bitter
aftertaste
that
is
very
pleasing
mouthfeel

very
creamy
and

a
good
body

thanks
jay
this
is
a
maltbomb
of
a
beer
the
malt
isnt
as
bready
as
with
other
doppelbocks
it
has
more
of
a
roasted
flavor
fruity
molasses
and
at
the
very
end
a
small
dose
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
the
drinkability
is
great
unfortunately
im
scoring
this
way
down
due
to
it
being
a
stout
drinkability
is
great
very
well
balanced
and
tasty
great
stuff
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
nottoofilling
abv
is
extremely
wellhidden
i
made
short
work
of
the
bottle
i
had
and
it
was
one
of
those
beers
that
made
me
wish
i
had
bought
more
i
will
rate
this
high
on
the
drinkability
cause
it
is
such
a
great
tasting
brew
i
am
so
glad
that
hooker
has
made
it
to
pa
pours
with
a
nice
head
big
taste
of
roasted
malts
this
is
a
great
beer
to
sip
for
a
long
time
only
a
little
taste
of
the
8
abv
due
to
the
malt
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
this
is
truly
the
best
of
the
doppelbock
style
which
is
a
style
that
i
enjoy
cheers
very
smooth
and
drinkable
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
in
a
pleasant
warming
way
the
more
i
got
towards
the
end
of
my
one
liter
bottle
the
more
this
beer
started
to
taste
like
a
chocolate
stout
weird
this
beer
kinda
changed
as
i
drank
it
really
cool
really
delicious
2006
very
dark
brown
with
faint
deep
amber
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
looks
clear
too
but
its
pretty
dark
so
its
hard
to
tell
short
fluffy
tan
head
off
the
pour
which
settled
to
a
thin
skim
and
rocky
ring
good
retention
with
spotty
lacing
throughout
rich
aroma
with
lots
of
toasted
malt
hints
of
chocolate
plum
and
raisin
also
a
bit
of
subtle
smoke
character
as
it
warms
the
flavour
starts
off
with
lots
of
malt
and
fruit
caramel
cocoa
biscuit
raisin
and
prune
light
bitterness
that
lets
the
sweetness
show
plus
mild
hops
at
the
mid
theres
a
fair
bit
of
alcohol
presence
in
the
finish
a
little
flavour
and
lingering
warmth
it
ends
up
being
just
a
little
much
excellent
texture
with
refined
carbonation
that
leads
to
a
pleasant
creaminess
very
nice
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
and
im
glad
i
found
a
bottle
this
beer
had
many
strong
and
complex
flavors
between
the
intense
roasted
malts
the
biting
hops
and
the
alcohol
bite
i
found
it
rather
difficult
to
drink
furthermore
i
found
the
amount
of
hops
to
be
completely
uncharacteristic
for
this
style
of
beer
the
drinkability
is
also
very
good
im
glad
for
the
extra
bi
bottle
prosit
mk
this
is
a
unique
and
tasty
dopplebock
it
reminds
me
of
a
robust
porter
mixed
with
a
chocolate
stout
in
a
thick
and
creamy
package
smooth
and
complex
and
different
from
the
other
dopplebocks
that
ive
tried
d
this
beer
has
nice
dry
malt
flavors
that
were
big
but
smooth
and
the
hops
and
alcohol
did
a
great
job
of
supporting
the
malt
flavor
very
drinkable
best
of
breed
not
so
sure
about
that
but
a
big
impressive
beer
to
be
sure
taste
is
barely
less
compelling
than
the
nose
more
bittersweet
chocolate
more
maltyness
less
sweetness
theres
an
odd
rubbing
alcohol
flavor
in
the
background
that
kind
of
messes
up
the
flavor
souring
it
out
but
that
aside
its
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
though
a
tad
bit
soapy
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
but
it
seems
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
drinkability
tremendous
example
of
the
style

a
slight
nod

americans

bodied
with
a
velvety
mouthfeel
large
amount
of
caramel
sweetness
up
front
tastes
of
chocolate
light
roasted
character
finish
is
seems
to
combine
the
hops
and
alcohol
with
a
hint
of
smoke
to
make
up
a
complex
bitterness
that
leaves
the
palate
dry
and
the
belly
warm
this
beer
is
incredibly
smooth
and
drinkable
awesome
dopplebock
let
it
warm
a
bit
to
enjoy
the
full
experience
honestly
with
all
the
hype
on
this
one
i
dont
think
it
stacks
up
to
other
doppelbocks
salvator
and
ayinger
celebrator
are
both
much
better
examples
than
this
still
this
is
a
good
beer
and
they
get
a
lot
right
but
its
not
mind
blowing
and
i
do
not
feel
it
is
deserving
of
the
monumental
praise
it
receives
only
a
faint
noise
of
carbonation
release
when
i
popped
the
swingtop
which
had
me
slightly
scared
well
i
neednt
be
tho
this
pours
with
a
lower
carbonation
level
than
many
of
the
germans
it
seems
but
is
certainly
not
lacking
slight
tan
head
and
quite
a
few
bubbles
cling
to
the
glass
underneath
the
surface
smell
is
chocolatey
and
sweet
the
taste
matches
up
front
there
seems
to
be
a
slightly
grainy
taste
that
dissipates
as
you
drink
thru
the
glass
followed
by
a
rich
caramel
flavor
and
a
slight
bite
on
the
tongue
full
mouthfeel
and
extremely
drinkable
great
example
of
a
great
beer
style
pours
dark
black
with
a
frothy
brown
head
that
stays
with
the
beer
smells
of
chocolate
with
a
slight
hint
of
apple
the
beer
also
has
a
chocolate
coffee
taste
the
beer
is
more
bitter
than
most
german
dopplebocks
ive
had
but
has
the
same
syrupy
consistency
its
a
good
beer
to
drink
in
the
winter
while
watching
football
a
damn
good
beer
i
wish
i
had
access
too
at
all
times
1
liter
bottle
bottled
in
2006
pours
a
very
dark
brown
nearly
black
liquid
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
head
retention
is
great
as
it
lingered
the
enitre
life
of
the
beer
roasty
chocolate
aroma
maybe
a
bit
nutty
creamy
and
full
the
flavors
are
a
great
caramel
chocolate
and
roasty
blend
even
though
there
is
a
good
amount
of
roasty
flavors
it
lacks
the
bitter
bite
that
some
roasty
flavors
have
this
baby
is
smooth
great
body
and
a
lower
amount
of
carbonation
this
thing
is
solid
great
flavors
creamy
feel
to
it
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
all
too
well
this
is
such
a
smooth
dopplebock
very
well
made
excellent
choice
unreal
this
one
is
definitley
an
a
american
take
on
a
german
classic
more
aggressive
than
celebrator
which
i
think
would
be
an
obvious
assumption
bold
but
not
overwhelming
id
say
another
big
win
for
hooker
and
hartford
area
brewing
if
you
havent
tried
it
you
should
excellent
doppelbock
with
extraordinary
full
flavor
thanks
almalkin
for
the
trade
this
isnt
available
in
oh
yet
pours
a
very
dark
but
not
opaque
red
thick
creamy
looking
tanbrown
head
aroma
is
a
pleasant
blend
of
coffee
toffee
and
roasted
malts
taste
is
surprisingly
not
sweet
there
is
a
hint
of
caramel
sweetness
but
nothing
like
most
syrupy
sweet
dopplebocks
mostly
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
toasted
malts
a
bit
dry
in
the
aftertaste
very
smooth
and
drinkable
the
8abv
is
not
a
noticeable
character
while
drinking
unique
experience
in
this
style
for
me
in
a
good
way
excellent
drinking
experience
thanks
goodbyeohio
lived
up
to
expectations
heartily
recommended
wow
another
big
win
for
paul
davis
and
hooker
not
that
i
really
needed
to
say
anythign
about
this
one
poured
a
beautiful
dark
brown
you
could
smell
all
the
coffee
malt
and
it
was
unbeleivable
had
a
nice
big
white
head
on
it
mouthfeel
was
great
smooth
with
no
taste
of
alcohol
at
all
time
to
buy
al
lthe
1
liters
i
can
still
get
pours
a
very
dark
russet
tinged
brown
with
minimal
head
not
a
very
volatile
nose
there
are
some
rich
smells
in
there
mostly
in
the
molassessweet
malts
vein
but
theyre
very
subdued
aromas
what
aromas
are
there
carry
over
into
the
palate
though
which
is
rich
in
sugary
dark
fruits
like
raisins
and
figs
full
and
found
mouthfeel
with
fine
carbonation
and
a
noticeable
hop
bite
of
bitterness
fabulous
tastes
in
here
well
varied
complex
and
each
sensation
of
high
quality
this
is
an
excellent
doppelbock
ill
have
to
try
some
of
the
2007
version
as
soon
as
it
comes
out
one
liter
swingtop
bottle
with
a
bottling
date
of
2006
opens
with
an
audible
pop
and
pours
a
deep
dark
brow
almost
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
a
lot
of
lacing
aroma
is
some
sour
fruit
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
just
a
whole
lot
of
maltiness
taste
is
almost
a
cross
between
a
stout
and
a
dopplebock
with
roasted
coffee
flavors
up
front
and
a
deep
dark
maltiness
in
the
finish
with
a
nice
warming
sensation
on
the
way
down
im
noticing
a
bit
more
hops
in
the
finish
as
it
warms
up
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
slick
with
fine
carbonation
very
drinkable
ill
have
no
problem
putting
down
a
liter
of
this
a
great
beer
and
much
more
complex
than
other
beers
of
the
style
that
ive
had
very
good
this
is
the
second
time
that
i
have
had
this
ontap
at
home
admittedly
in
5
gallon
logs
were
not
talking
about
full
kegs
here
i
liked
it
enough
the
first
time
around
to
get
it
again
but
i
think
i
like
it
even
more
this
time
around
i
did
notice
that
this
keg
had
a
date
on
it
that
suggested
that
it
was
less
than
three
weeks
old
given
that
this
keg
is
so
young
i
thought
perhaps
that
the
first
one
was
older
and
that
this
beer
is
better
younger
but
i
dont
really
know
how
old
the
first
keg
was
so
this
is
just
conjecture
either
way
this
is
really
a
good
beer
the
mouthfeel
isnt
great
in
the
mouth
it
sort
of
feels
a
bit
light
or
carbonated
even
though
it
doesnt
look
that
way
perhaps
this
is
just
a
function
of
the
high
alcohol
but
i
love
the
taste
speaking
of
alcohol
its
high
that
seems
to
take
away
from
drinkability
and
i
can
smell
it
a
bit
on
the
nose
but
overall
i
recommend
it
notes
rather
dry
all
things
considered
how
can
i
best
describe
this
offering
rich
clean
focused
a
good
dopple
and
the
price
is
nice
as
well
for
such
a
big
bottle
but
in
the
end
its
just
above
average
to
good
for
me
thanks
go
out
to
bentley78
for
the
chance
to
try
this
classic
drinkability
this
was
a
sheer
joy
great
brew
probably
one
of
the
best
doppels
ive
ever
had
highly
recommended
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
for
a
dopplebock
its
really
more
of
bock
gravity
though
it
is
velvety
not
to
mention
very
drinkable
this
is
good
not
quite
korbinian
good
but
good
thanks
to
hardtarget
for
sharing
this
wonderful

second

vintage
2005
nice
chewy
mouthfeel
smooth
and
viscous
rich
caramel
and
peat
flavors
with
notes
of
ripe
dark
fruit
alcohol
is
entirely
masked
making
this
dangerous
a
spot
on
interpretation
of
the
style
better
than
many
of
the
german
offerings
ive
encountered
fairly
pricey
but
since
it
is
only
a
seasonal
it
is
worth
seeking
out
every
spring
drinkabilityoverall
just
loads
of
complexity
and
subtlety
in
this
one
seems
barrelaged
with
the
bourbonvanilla
notes
and
mellow
body
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
drinkability
heavy
for
the
style
but
great
nonetheless
a
perfect
american
big
beer
rendition
of
the
doppelbock
style
in
many
ways
a
more
impressive
and
complete
version
of
capital
brewerys
dark
doppelbock
nonetheless
this
carries
a
much
stronger
flavor
with
much
more
finesse
thanks
again
lou
drinkability
very
tasty
pleasure
to
drink
a
caramel
and
toasted
malt
goodness
graces
my
palate
then
leans
to
a
malty
faint
fig
finish
good
blending
of
flavors
and
nicely
balanced
i
couldnt
detect
any
alcohol
flavors
quite
creamy
and
a
little
chewey
this
one
rather
reminescent
of
some
brown
ales
ive
been
getting
into
i
really
like
this
doppelbock
the
dynamics
of
this
one
are
off
the
charts
and
the
chocolate
is
really
something
else
i
havent
had
a
beer
this
good
in
ages
find
this
one
for
sure
overall
a
well
done
dopplebock
that
i
will
try
and
enjoy
again
and
again
a
nice
thick
malty
beer
to
enjoy
by
itself
as
a
dessert
i
would
only
drink
this
with
food
if
it
were
a
tart
dessert
such
as
a
citrus
torte
otherwise
it
would
overpower
most
food
flavors
drinkability
his
awesome
near
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
complex
toasted
flavor
dangerously
drinkable
a
must
try
overly
toasted
and
hopped
for
a
traditional
dopplebock
but
very
nice
in
its
own
right
drnks
pretty
good
just
needs
to
lose
some
fit
rough
edges
which
im
sure
aging
would
take
care
of
one
of
the
better
dopplebocks
ive
come
across
loved
the
liter
bottle
certainally
needed
the
swing
top
lid
needed
2
nights
to
finish
drinkability
i
felt
i
could
have
drank
much
more
not
pissed
i
had
to
split
it
but
wish
i
would
have
bought
another
bottle
there
it
sits
in
a
tall
thin
glass
nearly
black
that
is
hardly
opaque
chocolate
brown
in
the
lightthe
perfect
color
a
light
slender
creamy
colored
head
aroma
is
of
dark
burnt
malt
with
german
hop
aromas
intense
but
not
overwhelminginviting
you
to
taste
the
flavor
is
rather
clean
actually
roasty
multilayered
in
malts
focused
and
delicious
all
around
the
hops
are
a
distinctive
part
of
whats
going
on
here
and
no
afterthoughtslightly
citric
and
floral
even
mellow
in
their
intensity
but
lplenty
of
them
the
finish
is
clean
but
notably
hop
laden
for
such
a
dark
beer
to
me
drinking
this
is
better
than
most
porters
actually
due
to
its
focused
intensitysort
of
dark
and
stout
like
but
not
quite
a
stout
there
is
something
about
a
good
complex
lager
and
this
is
a
fine
representation
of
that
mouthfeel
is
thick
nearly
syrupy
with
a
healthy
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
just
far
too
drinkable
for
8
liquid
bread
alas
if
only
it
came
bottled
in
pints
this
beer
is
pretty
prototypical
it
is
not
only
one
of
the
best
dopplebocks
that
i
have
tried
it
is
also
one
of
the
best
beers
of
any
style
it
is
wonderfully
smooth
and
creamy
making
it
exceptionally
drinkable
it
is
fully
of
chocolate
but
neither
sweet
and
syrupy
or
abrasive
i
get
a
little
cherry
too
as
it
goes
down
great
offering
from
hooker
very
carbonated
with
a
big
bang
upon
opening
and
a
huge
tower
of
fizz
on
top
of
the
beer
takes
a
while
to
pour
for
this
reason
this
thing
smells
like
a
beer
and
a
half
malty
hoppy
and
minerally
chocolatecovered
salted
nuts
with
an
earthy
leafy
side
ohso
balanced
with
its
alcohol
dessertlike
malt
and
smooth
velvety
bitterness
a
bit
thinner
than
i
expected
but
still
full
and
rich
a
little
candyish
but
just
enough
so
as
to
be
dessertlike
but
not
so
much
as
to
be
cloying
or
to
lose
drinkability
this
makes
me
think
of
an
imperial
brown
ale
go
to
hell
you
style
nazis
let
me
say
that
the
liter
can
realistically
be
thoroughly
enjoyed
by
one
person
if
i
had
to
pick
one
doppelbock
it
would
still
be
the
celebrator
but
this
one
has
an
awesomeness
of
its
own
and
it
is
made
just
a
couple
hours
away
from
my
hometown
cheers
to
all
at
hooker
you
are
a
worldclass
brewery
and
you
make
new
england
proud
the
8abv
is
nowhere
to
be
found
that
characteristic
matched
with
this
beers
rich
creamy
flavor
is
lethal
you
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
although
it
will
catch
up
with
you
eventually
if
this
came
in
a
more
managable
bottle
this
would
easily
be
my
favorite
beer
i
find
that
the
2006
bottling
is
the
superior
to
the
05
much
more
flavorful
than
before
strong
chocolate
malts
with
a
creamy
texture
that
is
almost
fluffy
on
the
palate
goes
down
terrifically
smooth
and
leaves
you
begging
for
more
everything
about
this
is
gorgeous
it
looks
almost
like
a
stout
but
still
manages
to
let
in
a
hint
of
light
has
a
strong
coffee
like
smell
and
just
hints
at
the
onslaught
of
creamy
chocolate
to
come
my
only
qualm
with
this
is
that
it
comes
in
such
a
large
bottle
get
it
if
you
can
d
this
is
so
easy
down
its
so
slippery
this
is
high
quality
even
above
to
ayingers
celebrator
thanks
to
goodbyeohio
for
the
trade
d
definately
a
drinkable
beer
this
was
my
desert
beer
after
dinner
very
drinkable
however
as
its
not
very
heavy
could
have
a
few
of
them
especially
if
i
had
a
25
ozer
one
of
the
darkest
and
deepest
doppelbocks
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
while
its
appearance
is
impressive
the
beer
lacks
much
of
an
olfactory
emphasis
and
isnt
quite
as
deep
or
complex
as
one
would
expect
from
the
amount
of
malts
used
or
when
compared
to
doppelbocks
of
similar
caliber
still
quite
tasty
and
drinkable
a
seasonal
offering
to
look
forward
to
update

i
want
to
extend
a
huge
round
of
applause
for
beerguy

bringing
this
all
the

to

he
is
a

a

on

sides
of

glass
an
excellent
doppelbock
that
seperates
itsself
from
most
of
the
beers
in
the
style
a
very
definitive
roasted
malt
flavor
melds
very
nicely
with
the
standard
doppelbock
brown
sugar
flavors
which
coincidently
are
not
as
pronounced
and
overwhelming
in
this
beer
a
smooth
easy
drinker
definitely
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
i
enjoyed
this
beer
from
the
first
taste
but
as
i
continued
drinking
the
beer
i
enjoyed
it
even
more
the
flavors
in
the
beer
seemed
to
intensify
new
tasted
several
times
on
my
visit
to
boston
and
was
impressed
by
the
malt
character
aroma
and
body
could
be
improved
but
the
beer
is
very
nice
and
one
of
the
better
american
bocks
very
good
the
drinkability
level
is
off
the
charts
an
excellent
beer
that
helps
welcome

on
this
unseasonably

a
friend
or
three
very
highly
recommended
my
one
complaint
is
that
this
beer
goes
down
way
too
easy
and
youll
find
yourself
drinking
more
than
you
probably
should
hey
thats
what
a
designated
drivers
for
right
bottle
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
color
beer
with
a
huge
brown
foamy
head
with
perfect
retention
aroma
of
roasted
malt
with
some
butterscotch
the
roasted
caramel
malt
with
subtle
hints
of
banana
also
dominates
taste
body
is
above
average
but
could
have
been
fuller
and
carbonation
was
at
the
right
level
for
the
style
alcohol
is
well
hidden
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
would
have
appreciated
a
bit
more
complexity
more
chocolate
more
banana
last
swigs
a
tasty
dopple
oh
yeah

this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
liquid
that
leaves
a
thick
head
that
sticks
with
the
brew
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
sweet
brown
sugar
herbal
hoppiness
as
well
as
a
fruity
essence
within
the
nose
as
you
sip
this
brew
the
8
alcohal
is
very
hidden
there
is
a
toffee
sweetness
to
this
brew
on
the
forefront
of
the
palate
followed
by
a
slight
coffee
nutty
taste
almost
similar
to
a
porter
very
nice
the
overall
brew
is
fantastic
and
the
smoothness
of
this
bock
just
makes
you
want
to
drink
it
all
day
but
watch
out
cause
it
sneeks
up
on
you
taste
plenty
of
chocolate
and
coffee
plenty
of
malt
and
a
pronounced
bitter
aftertaste
i
enjoyed
it
but
something
tells
me
this
bottle
wasnt
at
its
best
i
got
this
one
at
ne
bev
co
on
a
trip
to
orange
ct
7
99
it
was
bottled
in
2004
according
to
the
label
over
the
cap
it
poured
very
dark
amber
with
light
tan
fluffy
head
with
good
retention
the
smell
had
caramel
coffee
figs
and
some
roasted
nuts
the
taste
is
great
malty
sweet
caramel
then
some
fruit
like
apples
or
figs
and
then
a
slight
bitterness
like
dark
chocolate
it
has
a
creamy
mediumheavy
mouth
feel
that
leaves
some
of
the
bitterness
behind
i
have
been
liberated
thank
you
loren
this
pours
a
dark
reddish
color
with
a
huge
creamy
tan
head
the
smells
not
as
strong
as
i
would
have
hopedbut
you
can
detect
a
roasted
malt
and
roasted
chocolate
scent
the
taste
is
very
strong
on
all
levels
you
can
taste
roasted
maltchocolatefruitand
even
some
nuttyness
in
the
aftertaste
you
can
taste
and
feel
the
alcohol
warmth
its
almost
like
brandy
the
mf
is
heavy
and
well
balanced
this
is
a
very
tasty
beerbut
i
dont
think
i
could
have
to
many
of
these
it
is
extremely
rich
and
bold
and
almost
like
a
meal
1l
bottles
in
2005
flip
top
slight
fizz
on
flipping
the
cap
god
bless
the
dopplebock
brewers
big
rich
malty
caramel
nose
and
alcohol
with
a
nice
thick
beige
brown
head
nice
initial
tastes
of
caramel
sweet
malt
and
a
long
dry
bitter
aftertaste
the
taste
was
good
but
not
great
the
sweetness
and
roasted
malt
were
not
working
well
together
as
it
warmed
the
alcohol
becomes
more
pronounced
and
further
mucks
thing
up
this
is
big
and
boozy
with
some
interesting
roasted
malt
and
bitter
chocolate
but
i
hate
to
say
that
it
did
not
wow
me
thanks
to
aksmokedporter
for
this
so
now
the
quandary
do
i
cellar
my
two
remaining
1liter
bottles
for
a
year
or
so
and
give
it
another
whirl
or
do
i
put
this
beer
on
the
trading
block
i
highly
recomend
this
one
many
thanks
to
hopgoblin
for
the
trade
this
is
an
8
beer
so
i
could
have
cellared
this
bad
boy
and
let
it
stew
for
some
time
im
glad
i
didnt
but
dammit
i
sure
wish
i
had
another
bottle
so
i
could
lock
it
in
the
cellar
and
not
let
it
out
to
play
until
it
promises
never
to
use
any
more
wire
coathangers
ok
im
revisiting
this
beer
i
had
it
on
tap
before
and
i
think
i
like
the
bottled
version
better
or
maybe
its
just
that
i
have
more
of
an
opportunity
to
relax
and
drink
this
huge
bottle
than
to
judge
it
from
a
really
cold
pint
with
dinner
one
night
either
way
it
seems
like
theres
a
lot
more
complexity
to
this
brew
than
i
originally
thought
i
definitely
recommend
getting
the
big
bottle
of
this
reasonably
priced
at
nine
bucks
for
a
huge
thing
and
taking
it
all
in
over
a
slow
evening
excellent
head
retention
here
on
top
of
a
nice
dark
brown
color
nearly
opaque
smell
is
a
bit
tough
to
pick
out
actually
which
is
surprising
since
this
brew
is
so
full
of
flavor
but
what
i
do
pick
out
is
actually
a
seemingly
hoppy
scent
which
also
strikes
me
as
a
bit
odd
knowing
that
this
beer
is
primarily
a
malty
extravaganza
definitely
a
roastiness
as
well
though
with
a
pungent
bitterness
taste
is
all
over
the
board
that
milky
flavor
that
i
find
to
be
ever
present
in
dopplebocks
is
there
but
first
comes
an
array
of
dark
fruity
roasted
malts
and
a
burnt
bitterness
that
balances
it
all
out
the
hopping
of
this
beer
subtle
as
it
is
is
pretty
perfect
in
my
book
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
nice
and
spicy
and
dusty
this
definitely
plays
a
big
part
in
balancing
the
beer
in
my
opinion
though
one
might
overlook
it
at
first
with
out
that
nice
subtle
hop
character
this
beer
would
be
just
like
your
typical
american
overdone
beer
but
its
better
than
that
much
better
excellent
balance
to
reiterate
yet
still
aggressive
and
unique
surprisingly
bouncy
mouthfeel
for
this
one
also
really
separates
it
from
other
beers
that
just
try
to
bombard
you
with
darkness
a
super
thick
mouthfeel
as
much
as
we
sometimes
love
them
would
not
work
with
this
beer
definitely
a
great
american
beer
gotta
get
some
more
sometime
because
it
seems
to
get
better
the
more
i
drink
it
evolve
amazing
brew
totally
blew
me
away
poured
out
to
a
dark
cherry
brown
color
with
a
great
18
inch
fine
foamed
head
medium
high
carbonation
wonderful
lacing
around
the
glass
great
so
far
aromas
of
chocolate
malt
wood
and
spice
are
all
well
balanced
and
present
taste
is
excellent
flavors
of
smooth
dark
chocolate
roasted
nuts
and
some
dark
fruity
flavors
toward
the
finish
all
the
while
remaining
very
very
smooth
mouthfeel
is
full
and
rich
with
the
carbonation
bringing
the
tastebuds
to
attention
and
giving
them
something
to
notice
high
drinkability
even
with
the
8
abv
im
not
gonna
have
any
trouble
taking
care
of
this
one
litre
bottle
on
my
own
special
thanks
to
my
boston
counterpart
rousee
for
this
fantastic
sample
get
your
hands
on
this
brew
however
you
can
sell
your
first
born
for
this
beer
if
you
have
to
its
worth
it
highly
recommended
the
thomas
hooker
liberator
pours
a
beautiful
deep
mahogany
with
glowing
orange
highlights
at
the
base
of
the
glass
and
a
creamy
yellowedpaper
head
atop
the
retention
is
good
and
it
holds
fairly
well
considering
its
strength
but
eventually
drops
to
a
thin
collar
the
lacing
is
somewhat
limited
but
thats
common
for
the
style
the
nose
offers
a
combination
of
fruit
caramelish
and
delicately
nutty
malts
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
mouth
its
crisp
mediumbodied
and
finebubbled
the
flavor
is
very
much
as
the
aroma
suggests
with
caramelish
malt
that
suggests
some
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
roastiness
along
with
a
mild
fruitiness
that
combines
dark
and
very
red
fruits
and
a
judicious
amount
of
alcohol
the
bitterness
is
balancing
and
and
it
finishes
dry
with
a
light
wash
of
drying
alcohol
and
some
lingering
toasty
and
very
subtly
smokyroasty
malt
overall
just
a
great
beer
shared
my
growler
of
liberator
with
murrayswine
who
got
the
surprise
of
his
life
when
he
opened
the
bottle
and
the
beer
exploded
all
over
him
and
his
counter
it
was
very
carbonated
thus
big
big
head
half
the
pint
glass
the
other
half
was
a
thick
syrupy
dark
brown
color
toxic
beer
sludge
goodness
that
smelled
and
tasted
very
complex
there
was
sweet
chocolate
and
caramel
toasted
malts
some
nuttiness
butter
and
toffee
lots
of
toffee
in
the
finish
along
with
a
huge
helping
of
bitterness
the
more
i
drank
the
more
it
tasted
like
chocolate
overall
i
would
say
that
thomas
hooker
liberator
doppelbock
is
an
excellent
liquid
version
of
a
snickers
bar
nice
thick
mouthfeel
too
warm
and
loving
liberator
keeps
giving
and
giving
until
you
realize
its
8
pm
and
your
girlfriend
is
somewhere
very
angry
with
you
over
all
this
beer
is
fuckin
amazing
drinkability
definitely
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
but
i
still
prefer
celebrator
and
even
weltenburger
asambock
still
would
buy
this
one
if
i
could
find
it
though
very
good
brew
indeed
thanks
for
the
bottles
guys
i
dont
get
a
chance
to
drink
many
doppelbocks
and
this
one
was
definitely
a
treat
a
bottled
in
2004
label
is
across
the
top
of
the
1liter
impressive
looking
fliptop
bottle
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
almost
black
color
with
a
tall
and
very
creamy
tan
head
that
dissipates
at
a
very
slow
rate
lots
of
sweet
bready
malts
and
a
roasted
nuttiness
dominate
the
aroma
along
with
some
scents
of
cocoa
and
dark
fruit
fairly
full
in
body
with
a
quite
silky
texture
and
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
taste
begins
with
a
very
nice
roasted
maltiness
along
with
a
bit
of
hazelnut
cappuccino
and
notes
of
candied
plums
a
dry
coffeelike
bitterness
then
helps
to
cleanse
the
palate
a
bit
as
the
next
wave
of
flavors
come
along
with
notes
of
chocolate
liqueur
and
a
touch
of
fine
brandy
to
round
out
the
finish
a
truly
magnificent
beer
and
one
of
the
finest
doppelbocks
ive
had
the
privilege
to
enjoy
thanks
to
cmaruschak
for
sharing
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
thin
dark
beige
head
that
diminishes
slowly
thin
film
of
lacing
strong
roasted
aroma
bursts
through
immediately
with
a
touch
of
malt
underneath
rich
body
and
more
bitter
and
roasty
than
expected
however
it
smooths
out
pretty
quickly
flavors
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
a
touch
of
spice
and
hops
the
finish
is
tasty
with
an
array
of
hops
spice
and
nuts
really
this
doppelbock
is
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
from
the
smoother
and
creamier
types
but
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
a
doppledandy
thanks
to
danadeny
for
the
samples
big
zap
thanks
to
warrior
soul
for
this
dandy
all
i
can
say
is
wow
not
my
favorite
style
but
some
beers
are
just
this
good
regardless
of
type
for
a
heavy
beer
its
remarkably
drinkable
with
a
wonderful
smooth
carbonation
this
is
an
allaround
fantastic
beer
the
color
is
a
deep
brown
with
a
small
hint
of
red
and
a
full
tan
head
that
hangs
on
forever
the
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
leaves
me
craving
more
dn
by
far
this
is
the
absolute
greatest
beer
ive
ever
had
there
is
nothing
about
this
beer
that
is
anything
less
than
exceptional
better
than
a
westy
12
for
me
yes
perfection
in
a
bottle
heaven
in
a
glass
if
you
havent
tried
this
beer
yet
do
whatever
it
takes
to
get
your
hands
on

better
and
its

a
joy
the

was
more
of
a

with
generous
chocolate

and
a

taste
little
hops
slightly
oxidized
which
others
may
enjoy
my
rating
is
based
on
the
higher
2005
this
beer
pours
a
dark
red
it
has
a
very
thick
fluffy
light
brown
tan
head
it
fades
very
slowly
leaving
a
very
good
amount
of
laces
it
smells
spicy
and
malty
it
also
has
a
very
strong
hop
aroma
it
also
smells
of
chocolate
and
slightly
of
caramel
it
aroma
of
alcohol
is
very
faintly
present
it
tastes
quite
spicy
it
sweet
malts
it
is
very
sweet
the
roasted
malts
give
it
a
very
appealing
flavor
it
has
a
slight
hop
flavor
but
nothing
to
strong
it
leaves
a
caramel
sweet
flavor
on
the
palate
it
goes
down
quite
smoothly
i
think
that
this
beer
might
be
a
little
overcarbonated
not
so
much
that
it
detracts
from
the
flavor
though
i
think
this
beer
would
make
a
pretty
good
session
beer
it
is
not
too
high
in
alcohol
so
that
wouldnt
be
a
problem
the
flavor
though
slightly
aggressive
is
mild
enough
as
to
not
become
overbearing
i
would
recomend
this
one
to
anyone
that
likes
doppelbocks
if
i
had
access
to
this
beer
i
would
definately
drink
it
again
thanks
to
goodbyeohio
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
great
beer
uf
well
for
the
hype
on
this
beer
it
easily
lives
up
to
everything
it
pours
a
black
beauty
of
a
body
and
a
off
white
head
that
laces
my
half
liter
glass
the
whole
way
down
i
took
this
to
poker
night
on
friday
and
with
the
women
there
it
turned
it
to
a
game
of
trival
pursuit
this
beer
was
a
pleasent
distraction
if
for
the
few
sips
i
lost
to
the
curious
it
smelled
of
fresh
pulled
wort
that
was
already
infused
with
noble
hops
it
was
a
real
palate
buster
of
sweet
carmalized
wort
but
a
silkyness
that
is
close
to
heaven
there
is
a
little
alcohol
in
the
finish
and
it
coats
your
mouth
with
an
aftertaste
that
invites
you
back
i
had
no
problem
finishing
the
whole
1l
a
very
nice
beer
pours
with
a
fivefinger
light
tan
head
fades
slowly
and
leaves
some
lace
black
color
light
carbonation
and
heavy
bodied
nose
is
roasted
coffee
taste
is
more
like
a
porterstout
some
sweetness
slight
hints
of
alcohol
in
aftertaste
very
different
dopplebock
but
its
good
8
75
for
a
1000ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
taste
is
smokey
followed
by
mild
hops
and
crawfish
boil
spice
an
extremely
interesting
mix
this
is
all
followed
by
a
pillowed
front
to
back
in
its
taste
very
good
very
drinkable
holds
up
to
ba
reviews
standards
from
notes
pours
a
very
dark
color
with
a
medium
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
almost
totally
comprised
of
roasted
malts
they
take
the
forefront
and
keep
it
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
large
amounts
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
very
little
hops
can
be
found
here
this
beer
has
a
thick
body
and
mouthfeel
but
could
probably
use
a
little
more
drinkability
is
great
on
this
one
wow
sometimes
my
scores
are
all
over
the
place
but
what
are
ya
gonna
do
had
on
tap
at
bones
in
the
past
week
or
so
goblet
pour
was
very
very
dark
brown
with
a
frothy
coffee
like
head
aroma
was
low
and
had
some
chocolatemalty
notes
tastewise
theres
some
prickly
malt
with
some
alcohol
showing
through
what
i
found
with
this
brew
was
the
flavor
was
all
up
front
and
then
bottomed
out
quickly
what
i
also
found
was
that
the
warmer
the
beer
became
the
less
enjoyable
it
was
sorry
to
be
so
harsh
it
definitely
wasnt
awful
but
i
guess
i
expected
more
gulp
whoa
i
wrote
alot
which
says
there
is
alot
in
this
beer
complex
and
difficult
to
dissect
definitely
one
for
you
to
seek
out
and
try
i
had
been
able
to
try
this
beer
in
the
past
at
a
couple
of
festivals
but
as
many
people
have
written
beer
fests
are
not
the
best
place
for
serious
tasting
i
was
pretty
excited
to
see
this
on
the
board
today
at
redbones
after
all
this
is
the
highest
ranked
dopple
on
the
books
deep
black
and
clear
with
a
nice
sized
tan
head
subtle
mahogany
highlights
mmmm
malt
the
aroma
has
sweet
toffee
dates
caramel
just
a
touch
of
espresso
the
taste
is
like
milk
chocolate
rich
with
a
light
roasted
malt
flavor
more
fig
flavor
on
the
finish
very
smooth
rich
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
im
still
a
believer
that
celebrator
is
the
best
of
this
style
but
what
a
great
beer
nice
18inch
head
coating
at
start
that
degrades
to
a
scrimshaw
covering
with
some
celestialaction
deep
dark
delicious
brown
hue
with
some
sheeting
action
here
and
there
roasted
malt
on
nose
with
caramel
and
toffee
notes
along
with
a
cool
alcohol
smokiness
char
coat
on
mouth
with
just
a
tiny
bit
of
fungal
presence
that
gets
wiped
out
quickly
by
the
big
malt
bill
very
drinkable
true
but
was
thrown
by
the
odd
fungalmetal
presence
notes
ive
had
some
doppelbocks
that
were
enjoyable
but
on
the
sweet
side
this
is
not
one
of
those
beers
this
definitely
is
a
malt
lovers
dream
but
there
is
so
much
going
on
here
and
it
is
blended
so
well
that
i
can
see
this
appealing
to
all
highly
recommended
very
drinkable
at
8
abv
a
very
solid
beer
that
could
become
an
even
better
beer
if
you
let
it
age
a
bit
my
guess
is
that
once
this
beer
matures
it
will
become
even
more
mellow
as
its
flavors
become
more
well
rounded
nonetheless
a
great
treat
drinkability
notes
surprisingly
this
is
very
very
drinkable
and
very
clean
hard
to
taste
the
8
abv
and
the
smoothness
feigns
the
full
body
a
bit
quite
an
amazing
brew
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
that
is
creamy
and
smooth
goes
down
so
easy
and
is
wonderfully
drinkable
easily
the
best
doppelbock
ive
ever
sampled
many
many
many
thanks
to
kmpitz2
for
sharing
this
great
bottle
with
me
thanks
to
ppoitras
for
this
one
it
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
a
2
finger
tan
head
that
falls
to
a
finger
the
nose
is
really
nice
with
a
big
roasted
tone
to
it
there
is
a
slight
chocolate
sweetness
but
mostly
roasty
the
flavor
is
awesome
with
a
big
coffee
tone
upfront
followed
by
a
sweet
chocolate
that
moves
to
even
more
sweet
chocolate
on
the
finish
damn
i
like
this
the
feel
is
thick
and
creamy
just
robust
and
awesome
overall
i
will
have
to
seek
out
this
beer
again
the
flavor
and
nose
and
feel
just
work
so
well
together
very
nice
beer
here
folks
pretty
much
fantastic
the
swingtop
pops
and
i
pour
into
a
sammy
smith
pint
glass
a
large
bubbly
head
dissapates
slowly
leaving
some
lacing
the
body
is
a
deep
dark
brownish
magenta
the
nose
is
one
of
the
best
ive
experienced
it
had
a
floral
orangish
aroma
not
unlike
a
walk
through
a
summer
garden
the
flavor
is
simply
full
no
better
way
to
describe
it
theres
the
rich
roasted
malt
with
just
enough
hops
to
make
you
know
that
it
is
from
this
side
of
the
pond
it
is
very
drinkable
which
is
good
considering
the
size
of
the
bottle
backwash
quite
a
lot
to
say
about
this
beer
first
its
definitely
of
the
first
rank
although
not
necessarily
head
and
shoulders
above
some
other
peers
like
celebrator
and
salvator
although
im
not
likely
to
have
the
opportunity
to
drink
this
regularly
i
will
endeavor
to
have
this
again
on
occasion
im
of
two
minds
about
the
bottle
it
definitely
makes
a
statement
and
it
is
a
good
value
8
or
so
ive
been
told
especially
compared
to
the
ridiculous
rogue
swingtops
considering
you
get
a
great
reusable
growler
but
by
the
same
token
the
package
definitely
discourages
grabbing
one
from
the
fridge
when
you
might
only
want
one
i
was
tempted
to
deduct
0
5
for
drinkability
but
thats
too
severe
thrilling
to
know
that
such
a
world
class
lager
exemplar
is
made
just
a
state
away
drinkability
gets
a
4
5
only
because
of
the
price
if
they
sold
it
in
smaller
bottles
it
would
be
much
better
but
a
very
good
beer
i
cant
compare
it
to
other
vintages
since
i
havent
had
any
others
but
this
one
i
liked
a
lot
overall
this
beer
is
so
smooth
and
well
made
its
amazing
that
it
even
stays
on
the
shelf
long
enough
for
bottles
of
it
to
make
it
all
the
way
down
to
me
in
fl
this
is
one
i
have
wanted
to
try
for
over
a
year
now
appears
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
good
tall
tan
head
lacing
was
left
in
rings
and
clumps
around
the
glass
as
the
head
stayed
afloat
scents
of
sweet
berries
and
chocolate
filled
my
nose
this
is
huge
with
malt
roasted
malt
and
caramel
aromas
round
this
out
while
being
super
malty
it
manages
to
stay
balanced
and
very
appetizing
bitter
sweet
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
are
the
big
flavors
notes
of
dark
berries
added
a
nice
twist
to
it
as
did
the
caramel
other
dark
fruits
a
present
in
small
underlying
notes
finishes
up
with
a
long
lingering
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
almost
full
and
as
creamy
smooth
as
you
could
ask
for
simply
a
treat
to
drink
drinkability
is
up
there
as
well
easy
drinking
the
alcohol
never
shows
its
face
and
the
fact
this
tastes
damn
good
adds
up
to
a
real
winner
here

it

the
aroma
is
of
mild
sugars
raisins
and
prunes
also
faintly
yeasty
the
flavor
was
just
slightly
on
the
bittersweet
side
but
with
healthy
dollop
of
fruit
tones
the
fruit
flavors
came
across
as
dry
similarly
the
mouthfeel
was
nicely
dry
and
with
a
very

it
was
a
very
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
beer
i
was
only
going

could
not

no
when

a

simply

theres
a
lot
of
hype
surrounding
this
beer
and
lets
let
it
be
said
its
legit
great
stuff
huge
thanks
to
mjr
for
sharing
this
gem
my
one
meager
complaint
in
this
absolutely
wonderfully
malty
maltlovers
cradled
chalice
of
honeydew
is
that
the
far
finish
has
a
subtle
hint
astringent
graininess
this
really
is
quite
subtle
though
and
only
recognizable
because
i
enjoy
chewing
on
malted
barley
of
all
shades
flavors
this
is
one
outstanding
beer
which
certainly
has
not
disappointed
me
in
typical
american
fashion
a
bit
of
brash
arrogance
and
rebellion
has
been
added
to
the
traditional
doppelbock
maltbill
but
luckily
the
brewer
had
the
sensibility
to
not
overhop
a
beer
of
this
style
let
the
malt
shine
on
its
on
complexities
and
merit
maltophiles
rejoice
and
make
sure
you
get
a
bottle
of
this
as
soon
as
possible
a
light
offwhite
head
stands
on
a
dark
nut
brown
body
aroma
is
initially
light
hiding
but
as
it
warms
it
gains
a
lot
of
expression
although
it
remains
a
bit
straightforward
its
highly
malty
almost
caramelic
with
a
shadow
roastiness
chocolate
hints
and
a
luscious
earthy
profile
palate
is
also
deeply
earthy
like
ceoncentrated
malt
but
still
very
soft
and
smooth
welcomed
green
hops
joins
in
the
finish
rather
grassy
it
finishes
on
mild
chracoal
and
potent
tobacco
notes
all
around
an
oily
presence
making
me
think
of
roasty
mazola
like
the
other
troutbrooks
ive
had
this
has
this
honest
medium
body
which
seems
a
bit
dead
mostly
from
low
carbonation
and
seems
to
take
off
from
the
flavor
development
and
this
is
really
too
bad
its
not
close
to
celebrator
and
andechs
in
my
mind
but
looking
at
the
other
doppelbocks
ive
had
this
fights
weltenburger
for
3
as
expected
the
salvator
seemed
thin
and
overly
caramelized
in
comparision
the
liberator
and
celebrator
shared
many
characteristics
although
side
by
side
the
celebrator
had
a
detracting
degree
of
caramel
in
the
malt
was
a
bit
harsh
in
the
bittering
and
the
mouthfeel
was
less
full
liberator
was
the
better
beer
the
king
has
fallen
all
hail
the
liberator
this
is
a
special
beer
its
everything
that
i
love
about
beer
to
the
nth
degree
doppelbocks
may
not
have
a
place
in
this
hopheads
heart
but
liberator
most
certainly
does
one
of
the
great
ones
drinkability
well
i
had
planned
on
only
having
one
glass
of
this
stuff
but
its
sunday
i
just
installed
a
chair
rail
in
my
dining
room
and
ive
earned
glass
number
two
this
is
easily
the
best
dopplebock
ive
ever
had
you
lucky
connecticut
bastards
overall
a
very
tasty
work
of
art
but
with
the
roasted
tones
in
the
beer
this
reads
as
a
strong
full
bodied
porter
however
that
wouldnt
stop
be
from
having
another
glass
thank
you
spencer
at
new
england
bev
for
selling
me
the
last
of
his
stash
this
dopple
pours
a
deep
dark
mahogany
brown
with
a
luscious
creamy
beige
head
full
aromas
of
medium
roasted
malts
give
way
to
brown
sugar
raisins
and
english
toffe
a
tease
of
dark
chocolate
and
powdery
truffels
adds
complexity
a
swirl
of
the
goblet
releases
a
pleasant
noblesque
hop
aroma
holy
shit
every
aroma
carries
through
into
the
initial
sip
and
then
some
this
is
simply
awesome
i
must
have
more
a
complex
array
of
roasted
and
caramelized
malt
flavors
leads
the
way
while
floral
and
herbal
hops
provide
the
perfect
balancing
act
dark
pit
fruit
toffe
creamy
malted

ovalteen
this
is
the
creamiest
beer
ive
ever
had
oh
why
did
i
wait
so
long
to
buy
one
of
these
now
theyre
gone
i
savor
every
drop
of
this
nearblack
liquid
all
hail
paul
davis
for
making
one
of
the
most
delicious
beers
i
have
had
transcendant
big
1
liter
bottle
with
a
ceramic
swing
top
was
an
imposing
sight
the
top
came
out
with
a
nice
popping
sound
effect
and
the
beer
was
poured
into
the
goblet
the
color
was
dark
reddish
black
with
an
inner
glow
that
exuded
charm
the
head
was
small
and
fleeting
and
the
lace
was
minimal
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
roasty
malt
that
gave
off
delicate
fig
and
chocolate
notes
the
hops
had
that
distinctly
germanic
grassy
tone
to
them
the
taste
was
sweet
and
malty
like
a
dopplebock
should
be
there
were
raisin
fig
apple
and
toffee
flavors
to
be
enjoyed
here
there
was
also
an
earthy
herbal
spiciness
to
the
hops
creamy
and
dry
at
the
same
time
the
mouthfeel
was
enticing
and
the
drinkability
was
enormous
this
was
a
very
beautiful
part
of
a
package
that
came
to
me
from
mikeys01
poured
a
nice
pitch
black
with
a
frothfilled
creamy
dirty
tan
colored
head
aromas
of
plums
raisins
and
dark
chocolate
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
was
somewhat
odd
with
roasted
flavors
and
unsweetened
chocolate
bitterness
that
seemed
out
of
place
for
the
style
fruity
nose
did
not
live
up
to
its
billing
in
the
flavor
department
but
i
picked
up
some
chocolate
flavors
along
with
raisin
notes
only
slight
hop
aromas
but
the
hops
were
plentiful
and
drying
on
the
tounge
mouthfeel
was
moderate
and
dissapointing
for
a
dopplebock
picked
up
some
vinagery
aromas
towards
the
end
of
the
liter
i
did
put
down
a
liter
in
one
sitting
but
it
did
not
leave
me
wanting
another
a
good
americanized
version
of
a
dopplebock
but
it
still
has
a
long
way
to
go
before
it
joins
the
ranks
of
world
class
decent
body
and
surprisingly
balanced
just
lacking
a
bit
of
depth
sweet
coccoa
powder
and
blackberry
preserves
move
to
a
dry
astringent
finish
granularfeeling
cocoa
powder
through
the
finish
as
well
fuller
bodied
than
some
more
similar
to
celebrator
than
others
in
that
regard
you
can
feel
that
this
beer
sucks
light
into
it
in
some
ways
it
defines
dark
beer
unquestionably
good
but
a
tad
one
dimensional
but
hey
i
kept
needing
to
refill
my
glass
i
was
surprised
by
this
encounter
i
expected
more
confidence
and
more
complexity
instead
it
adhered
to
a
fairly
straightforward
monolithic
flavor
profile
less
winy
than
the
best
examples
of
this
style
could
become
tiring
to
drink
not
any
better
than
dozens
of
widely
available
2xbocks
such
as
celebrator
einbecker
tucher
and
moretti
to
name
just
a
few
i
set
down
my
notebook
and
went
to
refill
the
glasses
the
once
dark
brown
lager
poured
out
creamy
in
color
with
a
ton
of
sediment
im
not
just
talking
yeast
here
it
looked
sandy
with
black
flecks
odd
i
tasted
it
not
good
not
offensive
but
nothing
i
wanted
to
drink
so
down
the
drain
it
went
what
a
sad
way
to
end
a
lovely
beer
damn
pours
a
really
dark
garnet
with
a
nicely
capped
eggshell
colored
head
plenty
of
retention
and
lacing
to
go
around
smells
slightly
chocolatey
with
a
hint
of
fruit
in
the
back
massive
tasting
dopplebock
full
of
those
huge
fruity
flavors
with
a
real
rough
edge
to
it
perhaps
a
walnut
like
tang
that
grabs
your
tounge
and
shakes
it
nice
malty
burn
that
cleanses
and
refreshes
huge
beer
mouthfeel
borders
on
epic
alcohol
becomes
apparent
quite
quickly
its
kind
of
hard
to
tire
of
this
my
first
hooker
beer
and
definitely
not
my
last
sampled

deep
chestnut
colored
with
red
tints
where
light
shimmers
through
a
light
brown
foamy
head
sits
atop
having
risen
up
to
a
thick
half
inch
cap
of
bubbles
of
varying
sizes
the
bubbles
slowly
pop
one
by
one
and
the
head
recedes
back
but
leaves
a
thin
film
that
rises
up
at
the
edges
of
the
glass
aroma
is
not
strong
but
gives
off
caramel
toffee
and
brown
sugar
and
some
sweet
berry
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
comfortable
and
draws
you
back
for
more
flavor
is
subtle
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
framboise
light
brown
sugar
and
molasses
there
is
a
faint
hint
of
the
alcohol
that
glides
beneath
and
stings
the
back
of
the
throat
some
yeasties
in
the
finish
sheets
of
biege
lace
cling
to
the
insides
of
the
glass
another
tremendous
selection
from
paul
davis
deep
nearly
opaque
black
chestnut
brown
with
dark
ruby
edges
and
a
nice
offwhitetan
head
that
lasts
and
leaves
nice
lacing
on
my
small
chalice
the
aromas
of
this
brew
are
very
enticing
i
can
smell
cloves
other
spices
dark
roasted
malts
sweet
caramel
malts
milk
chocolate
burnt
toast
and
bavarian
soft
pretzels
slight
booze
is
also
evident
in
the
aroma
of
this
brew
the
taste
of
this
brew
is
really
quite
exceptional
i
taste
some
nice
sweet
malts
and
roasted
malts
up
front
with
some
wonderful
clovelike
spices
in
the
middle
and
a
sweetyetalmostdry
milk
chocolate
taste
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
in
fact
the
mouthfeel
is
very
reminiscent
of
milk
chocolate
the
drinkability
is
very
good
for
an
8abv
brew
the
1
liter
bottle
was
killed
in
record
time
oh
yes
this
is
excellent
i
was
quite
happy
to
come
home
from
a
long
day
of
work
and
running
around
to
hear
my
boyfriend
immediately
pour
me
a
glass
of
liberator
say
here
drink
up
hes
great
so
is
the
beer
its
a
dark
brown
colour
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
lasts
a
few
minutes
and
then
theres
a
little
ring
around
the
glass
smells
ok
not
the
best
actually
but
caramely
malty
little
bit
of
chocolate
and
coffee
and
kind
of
like
a
soft
pretzel
actually
it
tastes
much
better
than
it
smells
i
think
like
carmel
and
coffee
and
a
bit
of
spice
kind
of
toasted
very
malty
though
with
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
and
an
alcoholic
aftertaste
but
not
too
much
maybe
like
a
burnt
soft
pretzel
mouthfeel
is
lovely
very
silky
smooth
and
drinkability
is
excellent
i
couldve
polished
a
whole
liter
of
this
if
it
were
available
to
me
glad
to
get
about
half
of
it
though
most
definitely
wyll
thank
you
to
counselor
and
bif

0
for
this
bottle
i
was
quite
excited
when
the
package
came
and
i
pulled
this
bottle
out
i
have
to
admit
though
that
when
we
opened
the
bottle
it
was
slightly
disappointing
due
to
all
the
hype
after
getting
over
that
we
realized
that
this
is
indeed
a
great
beer
i
thought
that
this
beer
had
more
of
a
porter
quality
to
it
than
a
dopplebock
but
i
like
porter
so
thats
not
too
bad
after
having
both
the
liberator
and
imperial
porter
and
having
the
old
marley
in
the
fridge
im
very
impressed
with
troutbrook
and
i
hope
to
have
many
of
their
offerings
including
this
one
in
the
future
my
thanks
go
out
to
erikthered
for
the
very
kind
offering
much
thanks
goes
out
to
beergeek279
and
cupbeerman
for
letting
me
join
in
on
the
sampling
of
this
highly
rated
dbock
we
enjoyed
it
at
one
of
the
newest
beer
hotspots
in
the
burgh
the
pittsburgh
bottleshop
cafe
where
we
sampled
this
brew
in
official
celebrator
glasses
man
are
those
things
cool
anyway
on
to
this
beer
appearance
deep
dark
ruby
chocolate
hue
tan
head
forms
nice
and
thick
leaves
some
scattered
lacing
throughout
the
tasting
session
aroma
i
was
hit
with
some
underlying
vinous
wine
like
character
along
with
robust
healthy
dosages
of
chocolate
roastiness
and
a
touch
of
underlying
over
ripened
fruit
notes
seems
bigger
than
the
average
doppelbock
much
more
complex
the
hops
send
herbal
tones
across
my
nasal
passage
not
bad
taste
alot
more
chocolate
flavor
than
your
typical
doppelbock
seems
porterish
in
many
ways
but
regardless
tasty
and
so
damn
drinkable
a
touch
of
raisin
and
alcohol
sear
the
palate
with
mild
overly
ripened
plums
complex
and
good
but
seems
this
one
caught
alot
of
hype
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
it
but
what
sets
this
one
so
far
apart
from
st
victorious
or
korbinian
in
my
opinion
not
much
mouthfeel
medium
body
big
lager
here
very
delicate
carbonation
makes
going
down
that
much
smoother
drinkability
all
in
all
a
damn
fine
dbock
that
i
enjoyed
but
i
think
i
let
my
expectations
ruin
the
experience
for
me
just
a
bit
incredibly
smooth
and
flavorful
robust
version
of
the
style
very
good
i
must
seek
out
more
brews
from
troutbrook
brewing
well
done
im
pretty
impressed
this
isnt
just
good
it
achieves
things
i
havent
experienced
in
a
beer
before
the
creamy
dryness
with
the
mellow
somewhat
understated
but
complex
taste
really
unique
and
really
good
delicious
if
you
didnt
hear
me
delicious
what
more
can
i
say
dark
brown
almost
opaque
with
a
very
nice
creamy
head
aroma
malty
and
roasty
sweet
malty
taste
munich
malt
comes
through
very
creamy
mouthfeel
8
alcohol
i
dont
see
it
or
taste
it
this
is
a
very
dangerous
beer
it
goes
down
so
nice
that
if
you
drink
it
too
much
of
it
you
will
feel
it
i
dont
know
if
there
is
a
perfect
5
beer
but
this
one
is
close
wow
i
finally
got
my
hands
on
the
beer
with
the
latest
buzz
first
the
appearance
well
holy
cow
that
is
a
impressive
looking
bottle
1
full
liter
dang
nice
flip
cap
on
top
with
the
lil
bit
of
tape
noting
bottling
year
nice
touch
poured
into
a
glass
with
a
bit
of
glugging
due
to
bottle
design
pours
nice
and
dark
black
almost
imperial
stout
dark
a
head
that
starts
nice
and
thick
and
then
leaves
itself
stuck
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smells
of
roasted
malts
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
of
roasted
malts
as
it
is
hard
to
pick
up
any
sweetness
in
the
aroma
tastes
of
roasted
malt
and
some
hit
of
alcohol
in
there
its
there
but
its
not
overpowering
very
very
smooth
for
a
beer
of
this
magnitude
nice
rich
and
creamy
mouthfeel
all
around
a
great
brew
it
is
a
opaque
deep
brown
color
with
a
billowy
tan
head
sweet
malty
aromas
pour
out
of
the
glass
with
some
noble
hop
floral
and
spicy
notes
as
with
decoction
mashing
the
malt
flavors
are
clean
and
maltedmilk
like
grainy
woody
and
very
slightly
smokey
in
a
finish
which
is
nice
and
long
the
full
chewy
body
is
balanced
nicely
with
spicy
and
mellow
hop
flavors
and
bitterness
it
has
a
nice
rustic
black
forrest
quality
to
it
highly
recomended
an
american
doppelbock
that
eschews
the
toffeeish
restraint
of
its
german
progenitors
in
favor
of
a
much
more
robust
roastier
state
of
complexity
at
certain
points
this
took
on
properties
of
a
porter
other
times
it
alternated
between
fruity
and
chocolatey
and
still
other
times
it
was
an
unmistakable
caramelish
doppel
complex
to
say
the
least
it
poured
dark
impenetrable
brown
with
a
pretty
small
head
that
lingered
until
the
very
end
the
aroma
was
surprisingly
mild
with
faint
twinges
of
nuts
caramel
and
a
slight
hint
of
coffee
the
flavor
strongly
carried
over
the
nutty
flavors
balanced
with
a
noticeable
herbal
hop
spiciness
coffee
bitterness
became
noticeable
balanced
by
some
chocolate
with
a
heaping
dollop
of
brown
sugar
and
maple
syrup
eventually
the
fruity
flavors
revealed
themselves
as
well
dried
apricot
peach
sour
apple
maybe
some
cherry
the
aftertaste
was
enormous
and
where
the
beer
did
most
of
its
flourishing
many
of
the
mentioned
complexities
were
revealed
only
after
the
swallow
the
rich
hop
spiciness
tempered
and
balanced
the
beer
and
kept
any
fruity
or
caramel
sweetnesses
firmly
in
their
place
the
mouthfeel
was
full
and
supple
and
deliciously
creamy
and
for
a
beer
of
its
darkness
and
fullness
it
drank
remarkably
easily
i
did
find
however
that
by
the
end
of
a
pint
i
was
ready
to
either
stop
or
try
a
different
beer
the
1
liter
bottle
is
perfect
for
splitting
or
the
swingtop
could
be
reclosed
and
saved
for
tomorrow

from

the
beer
was
dark

was
topped
by

the

was
quite
subtle
but
yielded
some
very
nice
aromas
chewy
creamy
coffee
malts
countering
figgy

and
dark

the
taste
was
anything

subtle
a

then
quickly
opened
up
with

laced
with

as

and
peaches
nutty
flavors
then
appeared
in
the
transition
to
a
drier
cocoabitter
nutty
dark
fruity
finish
the
distinct
stages
of
flavors
and
sensations
captivated
me
this
beer
had
just
the
right
mix
of
malts
fruits
and
bitterness
the
body
was
wellcomposed
for
the
flavors
and
character
of
the
beer

was
the
highpowered
carbonation
the
balance
and
excellent

bravo
huge
cheers
to
sulldaddy
for
the
bottle
almost
too
much
for
me
to
handle
on
my
lonesome
i
will
buy
more
of
these
and
recommend
you
try
it
if
you
can
zum

oh
yeah
it
was
time
to
open
up
the

today
big
1
liter
bottle
of
goodness
love
the
bottle
and
the
label
design
they
put
on
this
bottle
that
little
yellow
tape
you
see
on
the
top
mentions
what
year
the
beer
was
brewed
in
poured
out
black
but
there
was
some
dark
to
medium
brown
in
there
looked
like
dark
milk
chocolate
there
was
a
thin
layer
of
head
on
there
i
thought
it
was
going
to
go
away
but
stayed
all
the
way
through
smell
was
quite
malty
some
cocoa
in
there
perhaps
a
touch
of
nuts
and
dark
fruit
plums
mostly
caramel
and
chocolate
also
hit
the
nose
quite
complex
taste
was
just
as
complex
as
the
smell
was
big
chewy
malty
base
sets
the
foundation
of
this
brew
some
plums
and
caramel
hit
the
palate
gently
with
some
chocolate
and
hop
undertones
finishes
dry
which
makes
you
want
to
sip
a
little
more
everytime
this
beer
will
wow
you
for
sure
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
shared
this
with
people
but
thats
ok
im
just
spreading
the
love
around
me
what
a
stunning
beer
thanks
to
my
ad

this

dissipated
quickly
i
drank
this
warm
and
the
aromas
were
spicey

sweet
like
a
dark

bar
the
flavors
were
sweet
complex

moving
from

to

to
toffeecofffee
all
wrapped
up
with
a
nice

finish
dryer
than
one
sees
in
the
other
ators
from
germany
while
not
as
thick
and
cloying
as
the
typical
doppelbocks
it
was
great
and
the
abv
was
well
disguised
but
ever
present
in
thr
background
something
i
would
not
have
expected
from
a
thinner
doppel
enjoy
the
exquisite
taste
and
nose
the
silky
feel
and
somewhat
foreboding
appearance
made
liberator
amazingly
drinkable
add
that
the
8
alcohol
content
is
very
well
masked
and
it
gets
downright
dangerous
all
in
all
liberator
struck
me
not
so
much
as
being
a
doppelbock
as
being
a
doppelbock
borne
of
a
barleywine
such
was
its
complexity
and
breadth
of
hops
character
easily
the
finest
doppelbock
ive
had
and
worth
picking
up
on
sight
or
working
out
a
trade
for
huge
malts
make
up
the
flavor
profile
on
this
one
bittersweet
and
complex
but
oh
so
drinkable
there
is
just
the
right
amount
of
a
hoppy
bite
to
this
beer
and
the
slightest
hint
of
the
alcohol
lurking
there
smooth
and
creamy
with
prickly
carbonation
the
biggest
fault
to
this
beer
is
that
the
liter
sized
bottle
just
isnt
enough
how
about
a
2
liter
next
time
notes
absolutely
outstanding
in
every
respect
and
a
credit
to
the
style
this
is
a
doppel
for
lovers
of
malt
and
hops
alike
and
is
certainly
one
of
the
driest
of
the
style
ive
sampled
you
know
a
beer
geek
who
claims
not
to
enjoy
lagers
let
him
taste
this
one
this
stuff
is
killer
easily
the
best
dopplebock
my
tongue
has
ever
been
blessed
with
i
have
been
liberated
and
hope
to
be
many
more
times
in
the
furture
paul
davis
has
done
another
great
one
served
from
an
amply
sized
1l
brown
bottle
beautiful
glossy
label
graphics
pours
from
the
bottle
a
very
chocolatey
opaque
brown
capped
with
just
enough
tan
head
to
appreciate
before
it
sinks
into
the
murky
depths
aroma
is
full
of
toasty
and
roasty
malt
caramel
sweetness
and
perfect
spicy
hop
notes
as
an
accent
taste
is
wonderfully
full
of
complexity
leaving
you
at
first
wading
through
the
roasty
malt
flavors
then
basking
in
a
myriad
mix
of
fermenting
fruit
crisp
and
spicy
hops
and
fresh
roasted
hazelnuts
among
others
full
bodied
but
exceptionally
smooth
alcohol
is
very
well
concealed
and
only
became
apparent
to
me
in
the
finish
once
i
was
halfway
through
the
glass
excellent
local
offering
those
who
cant
get
it
should
be
jealous
1
liter
swingtop
bomber
first
off
the
bottle
is
superb
when
you
pour
this
one
it
is
an
opaque
brown
color
there
is
a
bit
of
a
tan
head
decent
lacing
the
first
thing
that
hits
the
nose
is
some
roastiness
i
didnt
expect
this
much
in
a
doppelbock
there
is
sweetness
in
the
nose
also
caramel
fruits
and
maybe
a
hint
of
smokiness
the
flavor
is
rich
and
full
the
roastiness
is
there
but
there
is
a
ton
of
other
flavors
in
here
complex
and
extremely
tasty
their
beers
just
keep
on
getting
better
with
each
release
perfect
for
a
bonfire
thin
mouthfeel
low
abv
but
oddly
tastes
alcoholic
very
little
head
o
not
bad
but
rather
mild
flavor
for
style
5
rating
on
look
bed
of
label
lol
pour
was
nice
too
this
brew
is
a
rich
chestnut
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
toasty
with
a
little
malt
mould
be
more
intense
same
for
the
taste
sweetness
and
some
mealtimes
but
not
the
strength
of
flavor
that
i
expect
from
the
style
medium
in
body
and
underwhelming
its
alright
it
isnt
a
typical
dopplebock
it
has
a
creamy
caramel
favour
to
it
however
it
has
a
tart
after
taste
it
was
ok
but
did
have
that
macro
brew
feel
i
wouldnt
be
embarrassed
to
bring
it
to
a
gathering
but
it
doesnt
even
rate
as
a
doppelbock
strong
flavor
i
had
hoped
this
was
going
to
be
a
good
beer
from
linenkugels
it
tastes
like
some
adjunct
junk
its
a
gorgeous
light
brown
transparent
color
the
smell
is
sharp
and
metallic
maybe
coppery
and
the
tang
of
yeast
there
is
a
nice
hint
of
malt
but
that
metallic
taste
overpowers
it
but
overall
the
taste
is
thin
and
not
complex
im
not
too
well
versed
in
doppelbock
style
but
i
cant
imagine
this
is
a
shining
example
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
free
one
and
it
goes
well
with
some
beer
nuts
decent
doppelbock
but
not
my
favorite
style
enjoyed
from
the
12
oz
bottle
this
brew
pours
a
crystal
clear
brownish
red
with
a
nice
off
white
head
of
tight
beaded
foam
that
settles
to
a
thick
ring
and
light
lacing
nose
of
some
of
the
usual
suspects
rich
caramel
malts
a
hint
of
toffee
a
little
bit
of
nuttiness
and
a
hint
of
raisins
absent
would
be
the
bread
notes
flavors
follow
the
nose
with
sweetly
roasted
malts
a
light
raisin
flavor
to
the
rear
and
a
light
nutty
aftertaste
still
absent
is
the
liquid
bread
goodness
known
in
the
style
finishes
lightly
sweet
and
roasted
makes
a
decent
enough
session
brew
but
a
little
lacking
in
the
doppelbock
category
poured
a
beautiful
dark
brown
color
with
a
finger
width
light
brown
head
smells
of
malts
some
roasted
caramel
maybe
a
hint
of
nuts
taste
is
nice
and
smooth
has
a
warm
caramel
taste
very
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
good
easy
to
drink
beer
i
have
to
admit
being
a
leines
beer
i
did
not
have
sky
high
expectations
and
im
sad
to
report
i
was
not
disappointed
i
knew
something
was
up
with
the
lightmedium
caramel
color
he
aroma
was
sweet
with
malt
and
bread
the
taste
made
me
conjure
one
thought
my
ass
this
is
a
dopplebock
if
this
was
labeled
as
a
marzen
that
would
make
sense
but
the
taste
just
doesnt
match
the
style
i
dont
think
ill
go
back
to
this
one
looked
good
in
the
glass
even
smelled
alright
for
a
doppelbock
but
could
have
used
a
little
more
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
for
my
liking
very
easy
drinking
sessionable
beer
though
watery
like
all
leinies
not
bad
tasting
but
nothing
special
id
rather
pay
the
extra
2
for
a
better
beer
not
bad
overall
and
very
easy
to
drink
good
beer
shiner
bockishbut
not
as
good
i
screwed
the
cap
off
without
difficulty
and
began
an
aggro
pour
that
created
twoplus
fingers
of
foamy
lighttan
head
with
moderate
retention
color
was
dark
brown
to
very
dark
brown
srm
27
a
really
quite
pathetic
attempt
at
a
dopplebock
if
they
branded
this
differently
it
would
be
a
little
better
but
rating
to
style
its
a
bit
of
disappointment
dark
brown
beer
with
no
head
little
carbonation
aroma
is
off
as
is
the
taste
for
what
its
supposed
to
be
it
tastes
more
like
roasted
grains
and
is
thin
bodied
somewhat
smooth
very
little
hops
detected
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
actually
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
dont
mind
having
a
few
but
its
no
doppelbock
like
most
leinenkugels
beers
its
wimpy
surprisingly
smooth
not
heavy
like
german
doppelbocks
if
for
nothing
else
this
is
the
beer
that
got
me
off
of
macro
beer
and
experimenting
into
microbrews
while
this
isnt
the
prime
beer
for
connoisseurs
it
is
an
excellent
gateway
beer
for
newbies
liked
the
roastiness
when
i
had
it
back
in
the
mid
90s
in
dark
body
maximum
respect
tell
your
friends
to
try
this
one
before
offerings
like
rasputin
they
may
not
be
ready
for
that
yet
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
i
didnt
think
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
just
seemed
to
roasty
for
a
doppelbock
and
the
big
nutty
aspects
felt
out
of
place
too
to
me
it
tasted
similar
to
creamy
dark
with
less
roasted
flavors
and
more
nutty
flavors
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
very
smooth
pretty
crisp
slightly
prickly
a
little
creamy
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
especially
in
the
spring
time
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
was
the
taste
it
wasnt
bad
tasting
beer
it
just
wasnt
true
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
how
off
from
the
style
it
was
theres
no
way
i
would
guess
this
is
a
doppelbock
if
i
tried
it
blind
i
might
buy
this
beer
again
but
not
if
i
want
a
good
doppelbock
i
think
this
beer
is
worth
trying
but
if
your
expecting
a
true
to
style
doppelbock
you
will
disappointed
all
in
all
i
liked
this
beer
i
just
didnt
think
it
was
a
doppelbock
to
me
it
tasted
much
more
like
a
brown
ale
its
not
a
favorite
from
this
brewery
and
its
one
of
my
least
favorite
doppelbocks
i
appreciate
the
effort
but
i
think
this
beer
should
just
be
rename
and
just
start
from
scratch
better
luck
next
time
guys
o
a
very
pleasant
surprise
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
much
richer
than
i
expected
a
good
value
in
boxes
of
twelve
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
borderline
excellent
and
one
of
leinies
best
a
good
value
at
around
7
bucks
a
sixer
at
three
bears
alaska
o
decent
offering
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
offerings
from
leinenkugel
there
are
other
darker
beers
that
i
prefer
but
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
several
of
and
be
satisfied
3

overall
a
pretty
good
doppelbock
from
leinenkugel
thee
are
better
but
this
is
a
nice
version
not

drinker
wife
picked
up
a
six
pack
more
her
style
seems
average
not
bad
strong

flavor
from

to

never
too
overbearing
since
i
am
on
the
hoppy
side
of
life
while
very
open
minded
to
all
types
i
have
a
tougher
time
in
this
bock
area
ill
try
to
grab
a
high
rated
bock
asap
to
gain
a
better
feel
big
butt
worth
a
try
or
a
6
just
tried
this
one
over
the
weekend
once
again
this
brewery
has
proven
that
they
make
good
beer
cheers
o
seeing
as
its
lent
id
like
to
try
ayingers

to
get
a
comparison
as
i
said
earlier
this
beer
grew
on
me
im
no
expert
on
the
style
but
ive
had
one
or
two
i
hoped
for
a

very

the

were
lacking
but
the
taste
was
generally
what
i
expected
in
the
style
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
hard
to
even
call
this
a
bock
disappointing
it
is
rather
thin
and
somewhat
fizzy
for
the
style
still
it
is
easy
enough
to
drink
nothing
special
here
a
rather
thin
sweet
doppelbock
man
i
really
dont
care
for
this
one
tons
of
sugar
on
it
not
anything
like
a
lager
and
i
am
surprised
if
it
is
one
in
fact
young
and
sweet
watery
looking
with
aromas
of
brown
sugar
fake
maple
syrup
toasted
white
bread
and
slight
oxidation
the
flavor
is
quite
similar
but
it
feels
a
waste
of
time
to
break
down
all
of
the
different
sweetnesses
i
taste
in
this
suffice
it
to
say
its
a
real
sugar
bomb
and
not
particularly
true
to
what
makes
the
german
dopplebock
such
a
delicious
style
it
lacks
grain
complexity
it
even
lacks
that
meaty
hearty
mouthfeel
and
deeper
toast
levels
i
usually
look
for
i
dont
think
the
alcohol
takes
it
into
the
right
realm
either
although
with
more
time
and
a
heartier
yeast
this
might
not
be
so
bad
dry
it
up
a
little
ramp
up
the
booze
all
very
useful
potentially
as
it
sits
not
its
one
of
my
least
favorite
beers
from
these
guys
and
frankly
on
the
verge
of
not
even
really
being
craft
beer
quality
overall
its
a
nice
beer
but
a
little
tame
for
the
style
give
me
a
solid

this

carmel
flavors
that
want
in
a
bock
without
the
bitterness
o
this
one
is
nothing
special
not
offensive
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
not
one
that
i
will
be
getting
again
serving

another
outlier
review
whatevs
b
a
just
another
leinie
beer
nothing
special
better
and
less
sweet
than
most
but
still
pretty
much
mass
overproduced
beer
to
appeal
to
all
but
me
pours
nice
caramel
brown
color
with
modest
head
nose
is
surprisingly
light
with
some
toasty
bread
crust
notes
and
whiff
of
caramel
palate
is
the
weakest
part
with
a
very
thin
body
and
very
light
malty
flavors
if
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
doppelbock
light
this
would
be
it
weak
and
only

for
a
doppelbock
hmmm
i
wont
bother
trying
to
remember
my
old
review
and
it
no
longer
applies
anyway
while
this
beer
is
easy
enough
to
drink
it
is
barely
even
a
bock
in
its
newest
incarnation
perhaps
they
just
renamed
their
1888
bock
this
beer
is
a
very
thin
dark
lager
with
just
the
barest
hint
of
a
caramel
note
to
the
taste
and
even
a
kiss
of
hops
in
the
aftertaste
its
main
competition
would
be
amber
bock
in
the
category
of
too
thin
to
be
an
actual
bock
beers
very
disappointing
this
is
definitely
a
delicious
beer
overall
without
that
metallic
massproduced
thing
about
it
its
at
the
very
least
drinkable

most

d
it
really
isnt

definitely
better
than
most
of
the

six

from

this
beer
just
pops
its
crisp
smooth
and
has
a
great
malty
secondary
aftertaste
like
everything
else
from
this
brewer
this
beer
was
lightwatery
and
lacked
flavor
a
pleasant
surprise
didnt
expect
this
from
a

avery
enjoyable
doppel

could
easily
be
a
great

beer
a
session
doppelbock
yes
please
lighter
than
a
traditional
doppelbock
like
celebrator
for
instance
this
is
a
little
darker
than
a
regular
bock
with
twice
the
flavor
this
is
my
new
favorite
leinie
pretty
tasty
beer
few
days
late
on

said
for
the
taste
with
some
caramel
malts
also
just
a
slight
bitter
finish
but
didnt
last
it
was
drinkable
but
nothing
that
is
fantastic
as
there
are
better
doppelbocks
out
there
mediumbodied
with
slightly
above
carbonation
a
thoroughly
average
beer
leinenkugel
is
best
known
for
their
fruitier
sweeter
beers
and
personally
thats
what
they
should
stick
to
their
hoppier
beers
or
more
maltier
mainstream
offerings
propose
variety
but
not
much
else
just
stop
seriously
stop
good
easy
drinking
malty
beer
overall
yet
mediocre
at
best
for
a
doppelbock
its
fair
and
its
growing
on
me
under
6
which
remains
sessionable
to
me
leinenkugels
gets
a
bad
rep
but
its
not
a
terrible
beer
there
are
much
better
bocks
of
course
but
this
one
is
drinkable
dark
reddish
brown
body
poured
with
a
34th
inch
head
that
dissipated
quickly
malty
aroma
with
a
small
inkling
of
hops
taste
is
a
sweet
caramel
grain
flavor
one
of
the
better
leinies
beers
ive
had
great
beer
glad
they
brought
it
back
flavor
is
sweet
malt
from
start
to
finish
caramel
and
brown
sugar
mixed
together
and
not
too
much
more
this
isnt
cloying
or
overly
sweet
but
not
much
complexity
either
i
find
it
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
but
it
isnt
in
the
top
tier
of
dopplebocks
either
i
would
drink
this
again
but
wouldnt
hunt
it
down
if
it
comes
back
from
the
brewery
had
this
first
back
in
law
school
kinda
funny
a
friend
with
a
much
bigger
rack
than
butt
talked
this
beer
up
actually
she
had
a
nice
butt
ah
drinking
romps
wondered
why
she
never
flaunted
that
as
much
as
the
huge
chest
oh
well
id
say
avoid
this
beer
if
youre
a
big
doppelbock
fan
but
the
label
is
pretty
cool
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
half
inch
head
that
dissipates
quickly
scent
is
mild
but
has
characters
of
robust
malts
caramel
malts
and
toffee
picking
out
some
mildly
heavy
hints
of
cocoa
toffee
caramel
and
hints
of
nuts
granted
this
has
been
sitting
around
for
34
years
but
it
seems
rather
flat
and
doesnt
really
hit
any
high
notes
on
taste
smooth
and
easy
drinking
but
i
dont
think
aging
did
this
beer
any
favors
d
nothing
special
going
on
here
falls
quite
a
bit
short
in
the
world
of
dopplebocks
but
thats
just
me
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
with
a
quickly
diminishing
light
brown
head
aroma
is
nutty
and
a
slight
hint
of
roasted
malts
altogether
kind
of
weak
flavor
is
pretty
good
roasted
malts
raisins
fruity
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
caramel
mouthfeel
is
kinda
light
for
a
doppel
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
a
roasted
flavor
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
but
doesnt
seem
quite
up
to
style
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
bought
this
one
its
probably
been
6
monthsish
and
i
dont
recall
what
i
paid
for
it
i
think
that
i
got
it
from
the
wine
garden
in
blackfoot
but
dont
me
good
beer
nice
and
beer
tasting
a
bit
on
the
lite
side
as
far
as
mouth
feel
goes
but
a
good
drinker
extra
frothy
head
for
a
dopple
bock
i
think
and
it
stuck
around
for
a
good
15mins
oddly
little
lacing
cheers
generally
this
one
has
good
drinkability
and
would
serve
adequately
as
a
session
beer
tastes
like
caramel
roasted
malts
and
fruity
honey
molasses
bittersweet
has
a
good
aftertaste
very
sweet
a
decent
dopplebock
light
and
drinkable
the
lagering
really
helps
smooth
this
out
a
nice
intro
to
the
doppelbock
style
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
sam
adams
bl
glass
the
beer
pours
a
brownreddish
color
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
tan
head
lacing
and
head
retention
are
both
average
it
smells
like
toasted
malt
prunes
and
toffee
however
the
aroma
isnt
strong
at
all
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
a
little
bit
of
fruit
and
raisins
noticable
along
with
a
weird
tart
taste
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
creamy
but
also
thin
drinkability
is
ok
overall
i
think
this
is
an
average
beer
and
below
average
for
the
style
its
not
bad
but
i
would
pick
plenty
of
dopplebocks
before
i
would
try
this
one
again
this
brew
pours
a
darker
redbrown
but
not
as
dark
as
i
expected
i
caught
some
whiffs
of
toffee
and
coffee
taste
was
a
bit
shallow
here
it
has
good
flavor
but
something
is
missing
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
but
not
bad
due
to
this
drinkability
is
very
high
here
i
expected
more
of
a
sipper
but
put
this
down
very
easy
as
long
as
you
dont
set
your
expectations
too
high
this
is
not
a
bad
brew
nose
toasted
malts
hints
of
caramel
molasses
and
notes
of
citrus
and
yeast
the
tasted
has
notes
of
chocolate
coffee
roasted
malts
and
hints
of
hops
a
very
good
beer
overall
there
wasnt
anything
special
about
it
as
far
as
an
easydrinking
beer
this
one
qualifies
as
far
as
being
a
dopplebock
it
falls
short
d
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
doppelbock
its
much
better
than
i
previously
remembered
truthfully
however
there
are
many
other
bocks
id
rather
drink
all
in
all
given
the
lower
abv
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
doppelbock
pours
mostly
black
with
a
slight
transparencey
to
hit
and
no
head
smell
is
malty
and
rich
taste
is
thin
bland
maltiness
with
a
hint
of
tartness
and
not
very
flavorful
compared
to
the
nose
not
really
very
good
or
fresh
tasting
and
is
a
bit
thin
and
bubbly
eh
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
perhaps
miscategorized
nice
dark
brown
color
holding
a
sandcolored
head
smelled
the
dark
malts
clearly
but
had
a
bit
of
a
wet
cardboard
aroma
as
well
disappointed
in
taste
a
bit
of
toasted
grain
rather
sweet
and
strong
mettalic
taste
mouthfeel
was
fiszzy
and
thin
not
what
i
expectoed
or
wanted
in
a
doppelbock
drank
alright
would
be
more
believable
as
a
bock
lost
some
points
since
it
didnt
posses
malt
depth
of
any
real
spiceyness
or
fruittyness
to
much
midwestamerican
influence
here
for
me
closer
to
shiner
than
celebrator
to
be
sure
i
like
their
dark
cream
lager
more
so
d
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
for
the
style
it
just
doesnt
do
it
i
dont
plan
on
having
it
again
mouthfeel
is
initally
slick
but
finishes
with
a
bubbly
tingle
this
is
a
poor
attempt
at
a
doppelbock
it
is
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
weak
head
the
nose
and
taste
are
both
way
to
light
for
me
stale
and
grainy
malts
with
some
sweet
flavors
a
light
body
with
fizzy
carbonation
not
the
most
drinkable
as
it
doesnt
taste
very
good
id
give
this
one
another
try
down
the
road
just
to
see
if
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
intentionally
if
this
were
the
expected
experience
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
and
served
in
a
bells
dimpled
mug
this
beer
poured
a
lighter
shade
of
mahogany
with
a
twofinger
thick
head
of
fizzy
tan
foam
that
displayed
some
decent
retention
some
slippery
lace
was
left
around
the
glass
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
made
up
of
sweet
roasted
malt
along
with
some
mild
caramel
and
chocolate
notes
very
restrained
the
flavor
was
also
a
bit
weak
with
some
slight
roast
sneaking
in
as
well
as
some
very
faint
dark
fruits
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
was
light
to
mediumbodied
a
tad
watery
and
highly
carbonated
if
you
like
your
doppelbocks
bland
and
mundane
this
will
fill
the
bill
d
not
something
i
would
drink
much
of
but
thats
mostly
due
to
the
taste
d
overall
an
okay
beer
i
wont
mind
finishing
off
the
6
pack
as
the
beer
is
unoffensive
but
it
is
only
an
okay
beer
i
would
probably
not
buy
it
again
if
i
saw
it
out
at
all
d
this
fell
short
of
what
a
doppelbock
should
be
imo
not
horrible
even
though
there
are
some
off
flavors
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
basically
worth
a
try
hrmm
not
in
the
same
league
as
traditional
dopplebocks
but
stronger
than
a
traditional
brown
ale
this
is
best
enjoyed
as
a
bock
to
expect
this
to
taste
like
a
dopplebock
is
too
much
so
it
shouldnt
be
marketed
as
such
overall
though
its
a
decent
bock
considering
the
price
id
buy
it
over
michelob
bock
i
really
need
to
find
a
good
rep
of
this
style
and
give
it
a
shot
overall
impression
strikes
me
more
as
an
american
dark
lager
its
a
dopplebock
the
way
shiner
bock
is
a
bock
thats
to
say
not
really
never
had
any
real
love
for
leinenkugels
and
this
isnt
really
helping
any
still
a
clean
easy
beer
that
shouldnt
offend
anyone
as
simon
on
american
idol
would
say
it
was
ok
but
i
really
wasnt
impressed
pours
with
a
reddish
hue
aromas
of
bready
malty
grainy
and
slight
sulfer
taste
of
sweet
malt
with
bready
doughy
aftertaste
minimal
to
no
dominating
hop
presence
but
no
surprise
there
all
in
all
an
average
representation
of
the
bock
style
especially
a
doppelbock
this
beer
should
have
more
punch
to
it
then
again
it
is
produced
for
the
masses
not
the
beer
connoisseur
this
doppelbock
from
leinenkugel
was
pretty
much
a
macro
in
disguise
drinkable
but
very
thin
and
average
at
best
got
5
more
that
ill
have
to
give
to
less
discerning
friends
overall
it
was
an
okay
beer
youll
get
a
mild
thrill
out
of
this
one
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
quite
easy
to
drink
but
it
seems
to
gain
some
of
its
drinkability
at
the
expense
of
depth
of
flavor
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
but
the
flavor
is
somewhat
flat
and
even
a
bit
watery
while
the
body
is
far
too
thin
not
bad
overall
but
not
something
i
would
buy
again
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
really
like
a
german
doppelbock
overall
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
but
i
wont
be
drinking
anymore
of
it
there
is
just
not
enough
flavor
to
want
me
to
take
another
drink
after
a
while
i
took
big
gulps
so
i
could
finish
this
one
and
move
on
overall
i
am
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
but
the
only
redeaming
quality
is
the
drinkablity
and
the
label
is
pretty
cool
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
the
head
is
larger
but
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
very
faint
hint
of
caramel
and
nothing
else
the
taste
is
a
little
more
pronounce
than
the
aroma
however
it
is
mild
and
plain
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
for
a
doppelbock
overall
this
is
a
weak
example
of
a
doppelbock
i
will
not
drink
this
again
d
not
too
impressed
with
this
one
lacks
flavor
expected
from
this
style
of
beer
however
it
would
be
an
good
one
for
transitioning
someone
who
is
used
to
standard
american
light
beer
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
i
may
buy
again
but
not
when
there
are
better
alternatives
for
the
same
price
clear
deep
copper
color
with
a
goodly
sized
light
tan
head
not
bad
in
the
nose
some
sweet
caramel
and
toasted
malts
with
a
small
amount
of
dark
fruity
and
nuttiness
in
the
background
light
in
taste
with
a
carbonated
and
watery
mouthfeel
mostly
toasted
malts
with
a
light
amount
of
chocolate
and
caramel
sweetness
perhaps
some
dark
fruits
and
earthiness
hide
in
here
as
well
but
very
light
for
a
doppel
not
impressive
you
probably
dont
need
to
try
it
unless
you
are
in
a
bar
that
only
has
macro
light
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
deep
copperamber
color
with
a
one
finger
effervescent
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
just
a
bubbly
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
and
all
malt
caramel
and
a
slight
toasted
characteristic
are
present
taste
is
also
all
malt
decently
balanced
by
a
transparent
hoppiness
and
a
slightly
burnt
finish
initially
sweet
finishes
dry
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
expected
for
a
doppelbock
light
to
medium
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
decently
drinkable
brew
not
bad
but
not
overly
impressive
either
it
is
relatively
cheap
though
there
is
an
attempt
here
to
create
a
complex
brew
but
i
feel
it
came
up
just
a
bit
short
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
i
cant
say
its
solid
either
i
will
enjoy
this
one
and
the
rest
of
my
sixer
i
will
recommend
this
one
to
friends
but
not
as
highly
as
other
wisconsin
brewed
beers
light
bodied
again
a
bit
weak
for
a
doppel
bock
but
easy
to
drink
kind
of
a
doppel
bock
with
training
wheels
not
bad
but
just
not
really
typical
for
the
style
overall
it
tastes
better
than
a
lot
of
beers
but
to
call
it
a
doppelbock
is
quite
a
stretch
it
is
dark
for
doppelbock
with
thin
fine
head
that
disapated
quickly
for
the
color
to
be
so
dark
the
flavors
are
surprising
light
a
lot
of
malt
i
think
helps
to
calm
the
flavors
and
dry
the
finish
a
little
a
great
doppelbock
if
looking
to
get
through
a
six
pack
and
the
price
is
alawys
good
on
leinenkugels
true
this
is
nowhere
near
the
quality
of
celebrator
or
optimator
but
considering
i
paid
11
for
a
12
pack
i
really
cant
complain
d
o
boy
slammed
all
12
and
was
sad
i
didnt
have
more
this
is
an
exceptional
drinker
all
night
type
beer
i
am
saddened
that
it
is
only
a
seasonal
brew
its
fun
to
drink
for
a
night
here
and
there
but
i
wont
be
living
on
it
poured
from
bottle
to
tulip
glass
dark
a
a
coke
decent
head
retention
aroma
is
very
nice
roasted
malt
and
a
wiff
of
citrus
maybe
taste
is
mellow
sweet
malts
and
a
bit
of
licorice
and
a
definate
maple
finish
it
is
not
a
celebrator
but
and
decent
domestic
doppel
funny
but
if
leinies
wasnt
owned
by
millercoors
i
guarantee
this
beer
would
be
rated
higher
way
too
many
raters
look
at
the
ownership
and
let
that
get
in
the
way
of
a
true
sampling
and
rating
just
read
some
of
these
ratings
of
any
beer
brewed
by
bmc
no
matter
if
it
is
a
decent
beer
the
blinders
put
on
by
industial
beer
haters
get
in
the
way
of
true
ratings
again
not
an
asam
celebrator
or
tucher
but
it
is
a
6sixer
that
is
a
good
alternative
to
fizzy
yellow
domestics
not
impressed
and
that
i
say
that
as
a
beginning
and
not
an
ending
is
telling
two
fingers
of
tannish
froth
on
an
amber
body
not
bad
really
the
nose
is
practically
nonexistent
a
shame
generally
but
doubly
so
pardon
the
pun
for
a
purported
dopplebock
eventually
a
little
caramel
and
chocolate
came
to
the
fore
after
a
couple
minutes
sitting
thankfully
borne
out
by
a
decent
taste
yet
this
isnt
a
very
satisfying
dopplebock
far
from
it
its
pedestrian
an
unfortunately
forgettable
attempt
at
dopplebock
that
needs
significant
upgrading
avoid
nice
dark
copperbrown
color
with
lasting
tan
head
and
lacing
that
sticks
around
a
somewhat
plain
smell
a
little
malty
and
semisweet
aroma
but
nothing
too
prominent
i
detect
a
coffee
roasted
malt
and
a
trace
of
cinnamon
perhaps
i
like
the
flavor
you
can
take
in
way
more
flavors
in
tasting
that
you
can
in
smelling
good
body
and
carbonation
relatively
easy
to
drink
i
like
it
i
guess
in
conclusion
i
dislike
big
butt
and
i
cannot
lie
disappointing
overall
it
was
alright
it
was
just
a
little
too
light
for
a
doppelbock
in
my
book
this
brew
is
well
balanced
but
remains
thin
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
profile
is
bold
enough
for
a
good
bock
but
the
texture
is
somewhat
lacking
one
of
leinenkugels
better
offerings
but
a
few
steps
short
of
a
great
brew
drinkability
quite
good
goes
well
with
food
passes
the
ballgame
test
with
flying
colors
and
ive
drank
it
as
a
session
beer
as
well
d
its
good
for
what
it
is
an
american
style
dopplebock
needs
more
malt
nice
dark
copper
color
the
malt
and
hop
aroma
was
muted
but
i
was
drinking
this
in
a
smoking
bar
not
by
choice
i
enjoyed
the
balance
of
the
malt
and
hops
started
out
mostly
malt
but
the
hops
became
just
pronounced
enough
at
the
finish
more
hoppy
than
the
typical
german
doppelbock
a
bit
thin
for
a
doppelbock
as
far
as
mouthfeel
goes
certainly
not
the
best
doppelbock
ive
ever
had
but
a
decent
american
take
on
this
style
added
notes
my
favorite
leine
so
far
leinenkugel
only
brews
this
beer
as
a
seasonal
so
it
was
at
least
46
months
old
when
i
tried
it
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
no
problem
glad
that
leinies
tried
this
however
i
will
stick
to
their
other
brews
perhaps
its
unfair
for
me
to
review
this
in
comparison
to
other
doppelbocks
as
they
were
probably
not
trying
to
ace
the
style
oh
well
they
put
the
name
on
the
bottle
will
offer
the
remaining
bottles
to
guests
you
cant
win
them
all
dopplebock
bought
based
on
name
butt
is
a
funny
word
no
matter
how
old
i
get
plus
i
like
doppelbocks
so
how
bad
could
this
be
actually
kind
of
bad
the
appearance
was
no
problem
dark
red
copper
with
a
tan
creamy
head
but
the
smell
was
not
doppelbocky
it
was
more
like
a
dark
lager
normal
dark
lager
think
schwarzbeer
at
best
or
dark
heineken
at
worst
the
taste
was
more
like
the
dark
heineken
or
maybe
dark
warsteiner
either
way
it
wasnt
the
malty
goodness
that
doppelbock
promises
i
drank
it
anyway
but
im
glad
i
only
got
one
bottle
eh
a
low
end
summer
session
drinker
at
6
50
a
sixer

better
than
a
fizzy
it
deserves
my
rating
and
i
shall
come
back
to
this
one
on
bratwurst
day
this
beer
would
be
very
drinkable
if
the
carbonation
didnt
have
such
a
bite
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
full
light
tan
head
that
leaves
a
trace
of
lace
on
the
glass
mild
roasted
malts
in
the
nose
nothing
overpowering
taste
is
a
little
thin
for
this
style
roasted
malts
caramel
chocolate
but
all
very
faint
a
little
watery
feels
thin
and
a
bit
watery
in
the
mouth
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
it
does
get
better
as
the
beer
warms
up
and
i
do
love
leinies
but
wish
this
beer
was
just
a
bit
more
more
everything
above
average
beer
worth
drinking
but
nothing
spectacular
appears
a
ruddy
burgundy
brown
hue
with
a
large
quickly
fleeting
caramel
tan
head
leaving
thin
lacing
unevenly
around
my
pint
glass
3
5
aroma
comes
off
with
a
layer
of
fruity
undertones
especially
ripened
fruits
like
raisins
and
plum
notes
mild
chocolate
doughy
sweetness
going
on
with
a
grainy
off
quality
that
im
not
really
diggin
3
0
flavor
is
far
from
a
doppelbock
and
im
not
sure
where
the
alcohol
content
lies
but
it
comes
off
finishing
like
a
normal
brew
some
mild
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
qualities
but
overall
lacking
the
herbal
noble
hops
finish
with
the
complex
fruit
and
alcohol
mix
that
a
true
doppelbock
is
able
to
provide
doesnt
fulfill
my
german
beer
cravings
the
way
it
should
but
its
a
decent
shot
and
better
than
the
leine
wheat
beers
with
apple
honey
raspberry
etc
2
5
mouthfeel
is
in
the
light
to
medium
body
range
with
some
substantial
light
syrupy
textures
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
much
but
doesnt
ruin
the
experience
3
drinkability
is
not
too
high
for
me
although
compare
this
to
a
celebrator
and
you
could
probably
consume
more
i
dont
think
you
would
want
to
its
a
six
to
one
ratio
id
rather
drink
one
celebrator
before
drinking
a
sixer
of
this
2
the
rest
so
im
smattering
the
rest
of
this
review
together
because
there
really
isnt
much
to
talk
about
here
the
taste
is
rounded
out
with
grains
biscuit
and
a
touch
of
toffee
and
honey
just
not
the
malty
complexity
i
was
hoping
for
might
make
a
good
session
beer
but
for
the
price
id
look
elsewhere
a
refreshing
drinkable
doppelbock
not
exactly
words
you
hear
used
together
on
this
forum
indeed
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
refreshing
qualities
of
this
beer
and
the
lower
abv
that
made
it
go
down
very
easily
beautiful
cola
dark
in
the
glass
with
a
decent
if
shortlived
head
all
malt
the
chocolate
kind
in
the
nose
with
the
same
in
the
first
sips
a
subtle
tartness
follows
and
then
a
touch
of
bitter
roasted
flavor
that
is
really
a
great
change
of
pace
from
the
heavy
flavor
i
expected
this
is
not
a
sweet
beer
and
that
makes
it
even
better
im
glad
i
ran
into
this
at
the
store
i
wish
it
were
more
readily
available
leinenkugels
could
really
make
a
dent
in
our
local
market
if
theyd
send
more
things
like
this
our
way
it
will
become
a
regular
in
my
fridge
this
big
butt
was
a
dark
chestnut
brown
with
plenty
of
ruby
highlights
all
through
out
the
beer
it
had
this
really
nice
creamy
one
finger
head
of
this
white
going
on
tan
colored
foam
it
had
really
good
retention
and
left
behind
plenty
of
sticky
whitetan
colored
lace
and
rings
the
appearance
was
so
nice
that
i
had
hoped
that
the
rest
of
the
beer
was
going
to
turn
out
just
as
nice
as
it
looked
long
story
short
it
didnt
it
had
an
aroma
of
dry
spicy
hops
with
just
the
slightest
touch
of
roasted
caramel
malts
when
i
swirled
it
around
a
mild
whiff
of
cantaloupe
emerged
when
it
warms
up
the
cantaloupe
aroma
gets
a
little
stronger
and
conquers
the
spicy
hops
and
malts
i
dont
want
to
know
why
there
was
cantaloupe
in
the
aroma
the
taste
was
weak
and
thin
not
only
that
but
the
flavors
werent
good
either
the
taste
was
that
of
bitter
hops
with
a
dash
of
caramel
a
hint
a
roasted
malts
and
with
a
slight
alcohol
head
butt
at
the
end
it
was
more
hoppy
than
malty
and
that
just
doesnt
seem
right
to
me
what
isnt
right
is
all
those
weak
and
thin
flavors
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
way
too
light
heavily
carbonated
and
with
an
aftertaste
that
has
more
taste
in
it
than
whats
in
initial
taste
the
roasted
malt
aftertaste
should
have
been
in
the
initial
taste
instead
of
showing
up
late
in
the
aftertaste
basically
it
looked
really
nice
but
looks
can
be
deceiving
one
of
the
best
looking
but
worst
tasting
doppelbocks
out
there
its
just
a
dumbed
down
doppelbock
that
im
sure
i
wont
touch
ever
again
overall
a
light
american
introduction
to
the
taste
of
the
style
but
grows
bland
quickly
i
am
not
all
that
impressed
with
its
drinkability
although
this
was
my
first
dopelbock
but
its
worth
a
try
as
well
as
the
other
types
of
leinenkugel
d
one
and
done
mild
drinkable
not
particularly
strong
or
enticing
d
meh
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
good
dopplebock
purchased
and
drank
with
no
real
expectations
of
it
being
a
great
beer
ive
had
many
american
micro
dopplebocks
that
have
been
completely
bastardized
this
beer
rises
above
many
of
those
but
barely
starts
wit
a
promising
pour
that
shows
higherthannormal
carbonation
but
a
vivid
mohogany
ruby
hue
and
a
creamy
withstanding
foamstand
aromas
a
quite
faint
but
do
include
all
of
the
necessary
dried
fruits
light
spiciness
lowly
hopped
and
malt
heavy
sweetness
the
flavors
show
an
emphasis
on
the
malts
with
lighter
fig
dates
flavor
with
backup
flavors
of
nuts
smokiness
and
chocolate
though
the
flavors
are
present
the
are
light
thus
the
beer
tastes
and
feels
undermalted
and
not
as
full
and
round
as
needed
the
overcarbonation
proves
distracting
the
beer
shows
a
raw
grain
flavor
late
with
a
mild
grain
husk
astringency
the
alcohol
strength
does
not
seem
to
be
on
par
with
most
great
doppels
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
when
wanting
a
dopplebock
ill
go
to
the
true
german
classics
d
not
good
this
is
far
off
the
beaten
path
as
far
as
style
goes
and
the
mushroomy
characteristics
are
bizzare
and
unwelcome
i
really
like
leinenkugels
creamy
dark
and
i
thought
that
this
would
be
similar
but
maltier
boy
was
i
wrong
leinenkugel
has
come
up
with
another
subpar
brew
creamy
dark
is
the
leinenkugel
brew
that
i
like
so
far
avoid
this
one
i
like
big
butts
and
i
can
not
lie
no
other
brothers
can
deny
pour
it
in
a
glass
go
sit
on
your
ass
and
bring
one
to
your
lips
ok
rapping
bad
this
beer
good
i
should
warn
you
dont
expect
this
to
taste
like
one
of
the
classic
doppelbocks
that
come
out
of
bavaria
but
going
by
the
american
style
its
definitely
at
the
top
id
definitely
like
for
this
to
be
maltier
and
a
lot
stronger
but
this
is
something
i
could
drink
every
day
oh
and
to
the
light
beer
drinkers
who
constantly
rag
about
how
dark
beers
like
this
are
like
motor
oil
krystal
my
future
sisterinlaw
drinks
this
regularly
so
if
she
can
handle
those
dark
beers
and
you
cant
youre
a
wanker
nice
beer
for
the
price
great
for
the
fall
one
of
the
best
doppelbocks
that
i
have
tried
very
thin
on
the
mouth
easy
to
drink
but
not
worthwhile
allowed
this
to
get
a
little
too
warm
before
pouring
surprised
that
smell
and
taste
did
not
come
on
stronger
still
very
drinkable
and
i
will
be
buying
more
originally

a
very
ruddy
clear
brown
with
a
greasy
head
of
ivory
aroma
is
a
bit
floral
with
a
good
whiff
of
kitchen
cleaner
and
sweet

flavor
is
bland
slighty
bready
and
a
hint
of
warmth
again
served
too
cold
by
old

so
that
i
cant
taste
anything
when
will
those
bastards
learn
surprisingly
drinkable
pours
with
a
poor

a
dark

is
sweet
malty
and
a
little
of
alcohol
but
weak
overall
in
character
taste
is
also
just
ok
sweet
clean
and
smooth
this
beer
just
doesnt
have
enough
malt
and
oomph
for
a
dopplebock
mediumlight
body
and
smoothly
drinkable
but
not
tasty
enough
to
be
great
d
i
really
like
this
brew
it
may
be
the
best
leinenkugel
product

i
heard
leinenkugels
will
not
be
brewing
this
big
butt
again
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
experience
the
big
butt
picked
this
one
up
as
a
single
in
ohio
somewhere
due
to
their
lack
of
choices
however
i
was
not
disapoointed
in
the
selection
in
the
least
great
malt
characteristics
balanced
by
slight
chocolate
and
caramels
flavors
enjoyed
this
one
a
bit
colder
than
usual
but
it
held
up
well
with
some
north
carolina
bbq
liked
this
style
as
well
grabbed
this
from
the
leini
lodge
at
the
target
cneter
during
a
timberwolves
game
hard
to
tell
the
color
from
the
white
plastic
cup
but
appears
dark
brown
duh
smell
is
not
right
as
you
get
more
of
a
alcohol
smell
with
only
light
chocolat
and
toffe
mouthful
is
light
without
the
rich
maltiness
you
would
expect
from
a
doppelbock
no
hop
at
all
which
might
explain
the
stale
alcohol
finish
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
needs
work
i
heard
they
are
pushing
this
out
to
make
way
for
the
apple
spice
in
the
winter
seasonals
good
bring
it
back
with
some
character
big
butt
is
the
first
dopplebock
that
i
ever
had
its
very
watery
for
a
dopplebock
but
the
color
is
a
gorgeous
deep
brown
with
a
light
browntan
head
the
aroma
is
wonderful
chocolate
and
toffee
hints
abound
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
that
comes
through
which
is
odd
considering
its
relatively
low
5
8
abv
no
hop
presence
to
speak
of
this
beer
is
all
malt
this
beer
is
pretty
decent
for
the
price
yeah
its
pretty
weak
and
has
no
business
calling
itself
a
doppelbock
but
for
a
macro
bock
its
actually
pretty
good
the
sweetness
is
pleasant
and
theres
actually
some
complexity
to
the
flavor
big
butt
doppelbock
amuses
me
for
some
reason
not
because
of
the
double
entendre
of
the
name
or
the
headbutting
goats
on
the
label
leinies
best
by
the
way
but
because
its
such
a
pathetic
attempt
at
a
style
that
shouldnt
be
difficult
to
brew
it
isnt
good
beer
but
the
laughs
were
well
worth
the
purchase
price
pours
a
clear
but
dark
ruby
brown
carbonation
rising
good
head
for
a
bit
shrinking
to
nothing
and
ok
lacings
aroma
is
on
the
weak
side
with
only
slight
notes
of
caramel
malts
taste
has
hints
of
roasted
malt
tones
of
toffee
molasses
with
a
warming
nutty
ending
mouth
is
just
too
thin
dont
quite
understand
how
this
is
doppelbock
seems
like
a
normal
bock
to
me
and
a
pretty
average
one
to
me
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
very
crisp
with
few
aromas
not
much
going
on
there
the
taste
is
distict
and
bold
hard
to
discribe
but
nothing
that
is
amazing
a
very
watering
and
thin
beer
which
was
a
bit
suprising
considering
the
color
and
pour
of
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
not
so
pleasant
the
overcarbonation
combined
with
the
bite
of
flavor
take
away
from
the
experience
it
is
an
ok
beer
to
drink
but
i
recommend
the
other
offerings
from
leinenkugels
they
have
the
best
cheap
beers
around
you
can
try
this
beer
if
you
are
interested
and
have
tried
everything
else
out
there
not
something
i
would
buy
again
i
have
to
admit
that
i
wasnt
sure
about
this
brew
at
first
i
tried
with
twice
before
setting
down
to
write
this
review
if
you
are
considering
trying
big
butt
be
forewarned
that
it
should
be
drank
at
4045
degrees
this
brew
gave
an
aftertaste
that
smacked
of
stale
coffee
when
warm
i
was
impressed
with
a
rich
creamy
tan
head
that
poured
out
it
dissapated
quickly
and
left
little
lacing
for
the
rest
of
the
beer
the
higher
alcohol
content
aided
it
sliding
down
but
left
me
feeling
a
bit
cheated
i
love
a
good
doppelbock
and
this
one
wasnt
too
shabby
admittedly
i
am
a
leinies
fan
it
comes
from
growing
up
and
going
to
school
within
a
stones
throw
not
literally
of
the
leinenkugel
brewery
that
being
said
i
consider
this
to
be
one
of
their
better
brews
i
particularly
enjoy
how
drinkable
it
is
im
not
a
fan
of
heavy
hops
and
this
one
doesnt
over
do
it
it
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
and
with
a
tanish
head
it
goes
down
with
a
light
sweetness
followed
by
a
roasty
malt
and
molasses
profile
i
find
this
to
be
very
drinkable
even
though
it
may
not
be
an
award
winner
tap
me
another
one
will
you
verdict
its
quite
weak
in
body
and
flavor
for
a
doppelbock
but
its
better
than
i
expected
very
watery
in
the
mouth
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
at
all
the
drinkability
is
about
average
but
i
wont
be
pulling
this
off
the
shelf
anytime
soon
the
taste
is
dark
roasted
malts
toffee
alittle
hop
but
all
makes
for
a
good
creamy
mouthfeel
there
are
bolder
bocks
yes
but
drinkable
thisone
is
i
will
sure
buy
some
more
this
beer
is
rather
good
not
a
big
fan
of
leinie
products
but
i
do
like
this
even
though
i
think
it
is
a
little
low
on
the
alcohol
its
still
a
reat
tasting
beer
and
whats
up
with
the
marketing
of
this
beer
head
butting
goats
doesnt
strike
me
as
very
midwestern
northwoods
just
weird
a
bit
better
ontap
than
the
bottled
version
the
caramel
malts
really
shine
and
it
is
a
good
malty
brew
to
session
while
this
is
definitely
pretty
thin
for
a
dopplebock
it
is
enjoyable
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
not
a
huge
fan
of
leines
typically
but
this
one
was
alright
on
draft
i
really
love
this
beer
it
is
an
odd
one
and
almost
resembles
soda
more
than
beer
but
what
an
awesome
soda
it
is
eh
i
feel
its
low
rating
probably
comes
from
the
unfortunate
name
of
dopplebock
surly
it
is
no
mach
for
any
ator
it
is
cheap
and
damn
delicious
though

part
of
the
problem
has
to
be
the
low
abv
for
a
doppel
which
if
higher
might
have
given
this
the
kick
that
the
name
suggests
the
bloodhound
factor
both
muts
enjoyed
this
one
immensely
good
ive
got
11
more
of
these
to
rip
through
and
im
probably
gonna
need
their
help
ive
drank
a
couple
various
dopplebock
and
in
my
opinion
they
all
have
about
the
same
taste
after
taste
i
seem
to
be
a
fan
of
dopplebock
and
i
really
like
this
big

dopplebock
and
were
i
am
from
this
seems
to
be
pretty
popular
cuz
they
cant
keep
it
in
stock
i
would
recommend
trying
it
for
about
5
50
a
six
pack
u
cant
go
wrong
has
a
nice
dark
color
creamy
dark

and
i
personally
love
the
taste
of
this
beer
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
but
drinkable
i
suggest
having
it
with
spicy
foods
or
with
the
turkey
dinner
that
the
motherinlaw
over
cooked
it
couldnt
hurt
definitely
not
a
doppelbock
perhaps
a
nice
try
or
a
wannabe
but
no
resemblance
to
the
genuine
article
the
appearance
is
redamber
with
a
nice
size
head
of
foam
and
a
little
lace
aroma
is
muted
nutlike
malted
with
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
initial
taste
is
very
timid
consisting
of
weak
malt
sweet
fruit
thats
barely
there
body
is
medium
with
a
little
carbonation
and
the
finish
is
instantly

pass
very
dark

nearly
black
with
a
thin
head
that
is

a

smells
mostly
of
sweet
toasted
malts
and
tastes
much
the
same
with
the
addition
of
a
slightly
burnt
flavor
not
much
going
on

not
offensive
in
any
way

nothing

fabulous
here
and
id
grab
most
any

doppelbock
over
this
one
if
thats
what
i
truly
wanted
but
it
does
go
down
alright
and
i
have
to
give
it
a

for

overall
okay
beer
but
very
average
for
the
style
good
for
mass
consumption
this
beer
felt
almost
like
flat
soda
going
down
and
overall
im
almost
glad
i
only
had
one
of
these
because
i
dont
terribly
want
another
hopefully
my
next
dopplebock
experience
is
better
because
i
have
heard
things
about
this
style
that
suits
my
taste
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
ng
poured
a
dark
amberish
color
creamy
head
coffee
type
of
aroma
the
taste
was
a
light
malty
coffeeish
roast
flavor
with
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
this
beer
used
to
be
bolderi
might
drink
it
when
im
thirsty
and
would
prefer
a
darker
type
beer
beginners
who
are
having
their
first
dark
beer
seem
to
like
it
also
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
introduce
nonba
types
to
darker
lagers
and
ales
they
certainly
wont
walk
away
thinking
it
was
too
rich
thick
sweet
or
overpowering
definitely
one
of
the
better
leinies
brews
but
couldshould
be
much
better
pours
a
clean
dark
brown
with
a
small
offwhite
head
smells
of
mild
sugary
malts
maybe
some
hops
but
not
too
impressive
tastes
like
riceinfused
cookie
dough
sweetish
throughout
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
and
a
wisp
of
alcohol
feels
a
tad
watery
for
the
style
come
on
jacob
beef
this
big
butt
up
ive
heard
dopplebock
described
as
liquid
bread
if
thats
true
then
this
beer
is
appropriate
to
style
its
not
bad
and
definitly
drinkable
the
only
other
dopplebock
i
have
to
compare
it
with
is
morretis
la
rossa
which
is
much
more
tasty
ill
get
something
else
next
time
as
this
beer
is
a
little
too
boring
for
me
very
underwhelming
beer
though
not
undrinkable
its
just
that
if
you
say
doppelbock
on
the
label
youre
setting
up
a
standard
that
must
be
upheld
somehow
this
bottle
is
akin
to
calling
something
kriek
lambic
and
offering
up
cherry
koolaid
looks
deceptively
dark
on
the
pour
this
beer
is
found
out
when
held
to
a
light
it
is
actually
reddish
brown
way
to
light
for
a
respectable
doppelbock
small
bubbly
head
that
is
almost
insignificant
smells
a
little
roasted
but
more
towards
a
dunkel
than
a
dopple
tastes
slightly
roasted
and
nutty
not
enough
to
be
considered
a
great
dopple
el
this
was
a
great
doppelbock
it
had
a
fantabulous
mixture
of
hops
and
malt
there
was
a
subtle
hint
of
hops
followed
by
a
nice
caramely
malt
flavor
the
color
was
a
nice
brown
with
amber
hue
a
very
good
beer
i
would
definitely
order
this
one
again
feel
is
thinner
then
expected
quite
empty
and
no
real
body
then
just
a
very
slight
syrupyness
caused
from
the
malts
im
guessing
there
it
may
be
watered
down
and
some
use
of
corn
to
keeping
it
way
to
simple
for
a
dobblebock
really
no
different
then
the
regular
bock
drinkable
but
a
definate
miss
for
the
style
so
its
passable
this
beer
looked
very
nice
after
the
pour
a
dark
amber
color
with
enough
head
however
thats
where
the
quality
ended
tastes
of
caramel
and
grains
dominate
the
palate
i
dont
recognize
any
hops
or
any
other
malts
for
that
matter
a
very
thin
brew
that
lacks
texture
or
chewiness
it
does
go
down
easy
and
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
i
dont
think
id
want
to
this
cant
be
a
doppelbock
nevertheless
this
is
a
drainable
massproduced
amber
lager
probably
one
of
leinies
better
offerings
a
beautiful
beer
that
does
not
live
up
to
its
appearance
the
pour
created
a
clear
very
dark
amber
brew
with
a
nice
ivory
head
the
head
disappeared
but
slowly
leaving
good
lacing
behind
the
nose
was
light
and
mostly
of
caramel
malt
some
sense
of
toastedness
but
not
much
the
taste
is
quite
odd
musky
earthy
woody
flavors
overlay
the
malt
and
create
an
odd
sense
of
a
medicinal
quality
not
that
pleasant
but
not
hateful
either
watery
mouthfeel
and
lack
of
crispness
one
of
the
truly
great
bottle
labels
in
all
of
beerdom
announces
this
beer
too
bad
the
look
doesnt
carry
through
into
the
taste
cheers
appearance
is
opaque
burnt
red
color
with
a
decent
head
that
didnt
last
could
be
the
glass
this
isnt
a
beerlovers
bar
aroma
was
mild
but
the
beer
was
served
pretty
cold
flavor
umm
slightly
hoppy
and
negligible
malt
flavor
or
sweetness
smell
and
flavor
did
not
seem
to
improve
upon
warming
feels
like
water
in
the
mouth
not
a
terrible
beer
but
a
terrible
doppelbock
my
buddy
talked
me
into
buying
a
six
of
this
i
think
he
thought
the
name
was
cool
taste
is
pretty
smooth
though
not
as
much
as
some
other
dopples
some
tasty
chocolate
malt
is
present
i
could
tell
this
was
a
leinenkugel
product
nothing
too
special
here
still
glad
i
tired
it
dark
copper
beer
with
a
thin
loose
head
nice
caramel
aromas
with
a
bit
of
biscuit
malt
and
a
molasses
smell
the
taste
is
bitter
roasted
malt
with
a
bitter
finish
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
of
a
grainyhusky
taste
that
ive
never
experienced
in
a
dopple
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
the
drinkability
average
several
of
my
friends
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
i
did
i
just
found
it
to
be
a
disappointment
of
a
dopple
it
would
be
a
better
than
average
dark
lager
though
i
have
yet
to
be
impressed
with
anything
from
leinenkugle
notes
i
must
review
what
a
dopplelbock
is
i
always
thought
it
was
more
of
a
dark
hefty
brew
overall
again
just
average
overall
drinkable
and
fresh
tasting
not
up
to
world
class
standards
thanks
to
my
buddy
john
c
who
brought
this
sample
all
the
way
from
herman
minnesota
my
roommate
was
going
to
the
liquor
store
and
i
told
him
to
pick
me
up
a
six
pack
and
surprise
me
like
everyone
else
said
it
was
a
little
watery
but
it
had
a
pretty
good
sweet
malty
taste
and
smooth
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
good
and
with
the
sweet
smoothness
it
was
a
great
session
beer
id
buy
it
again
for
a
night
of
drinking
a
less
than
world
class
doppelbock
celebrator
doppelbock
is
the
benchmark
that
i
judge
all
doppelbocks
by
so
that
you
can
get
a
feel
as
to
just
where
im
coming
from
with
the
celebrator
point
of
reference
leinenkugels
big
butt
doppelbock
is
just
a
little
over
a
three
pointer
up
against
an
almost
five
point
beer
for
its
style
germanstyle
doppelbock
a
good
tasting
brew
for
sure
and
one
that
ill
pick
off
the
shelf
in
the
future
its
just
not
a
great
doppelbock

with

an

of
the

a

that

recedes
into
a

along
with
a
metallic
tinge
in
aroma
mild
toasted
notes
and
sweet

as
well
not
particularly
enticing
aromawise
caramel
malt
sweetness
upfront
in
flavor
fades
into
an
odd
melange
of
toasted
malt
and
grainy
tartness
one
dimensional
and
thin

character
from
the
excessive

weak

this

another

they
are

favorite

brewery
especially
since
they
always
seem
to
be
on
sale
for
56pack

still
good

with
a
shortlived

flavor
but
a

on

light
side
considering
the
color
i
will
definitely
get
this
one
again
threes
across
the
board
on
this
one
just
average
and
as
others
have
said
not
bad
but
not
great
especially
when
compared
to
true
doppelbocks
poured
dark
amber
with
a
decent
long
lasting
creamy
head
the
aroma
was
definitely
malt
as
was
the
taste
but
not
enough
for
what
i
expect
from
a
doppelbock
it
is
a
decent
deal
when
compared
to
what
can
be
paid
for
the
higher
priced
ones
kind
of
a
michelob
amber
bock
type
of
beer
if
you
want
to
call
it
a
dark
lager
then
its
average
to
above
average
if
you
want
to
classify
as
a
doppel
it
is
well
below
average
not
enough
bodycharacter
a
bit
watery
some
caramel
malt
tones
along
with
some
vanilla
but
it
is
a
huge
step
below
any
legit
doppel
they
were
closing
this
out
for
4
a
sixer
ill
drink
it
at
that
price
and
look
at
it
as
a
decent
dark
lager
but
never
in
my
wildest
drunken
stupor
would
i
select
this
when
looking
for
a
good
doppel
to
buy
my
ratings
are
for
how
it
stands
in
the
doppelbock
category
decent
frothy
head
on
this
one
nice
malty
aroma
dark
ruby
color
body
is
thin
for
a
dopple
taste
is
bland
for
a
dopple
no
off
flavors
are
present
but
there
just
isnt
enough
maltiness
in
this
beer
for
a
dopple
a
below
average
dopplebock
in
my
opinion
the
beer
was
too
red
and
the
head
was
too
thin
the
flavor
and
aroma
just
seemed
to
be
lacking
a
bit
it
was
a
bit
thin
its
pretty
drinkable
but
really
didnt
give
me
a
reason
to
go
grab
another
especially
when
there
are
a
few
bottles
of
sas
doublebock
sitting
right
next
to
the
leinies
now
that
spring
is
drawing
closer
i
tapped
the
last
of
these

a

maybe
initial
off
taste
and
lack
of
more
malt
flavor
rank
it
mediocre
im
beginning
to
think
that
leinies
original
lager
a
decent
but
really
mild
american
lager
and
one
or
two
of
their
extinct
brews
from
the
90s
are
the
best
you
can
or
could
expect
too
bad
the
name
stretches
back
to
1867
pours

and
looks
like
a
red
has
a
restrained

just
isnt
in
there
lightly
hopped
to
balance
the
blandness
some
graininess
and
alcohol
in
the
finish
but
all
around
very
disapointing
nice
head
to
start
but
quickly
dissipates
dark
sweet
reminiscent
of
a
fine
belgian
abbey
ale
but
this
is
german
all
the
way
big
flavors
of
raisins
caramel
and
black
strap
molasses
as
a
doppelbock
its
got
the
appearance
of
a
porter
but
the
mouthfeel
of
a
much
lighter
beer
the
sweetness
creates
a
slight
syrupy
quality
tasty
and
user
friendly
bock
beer
this
is
worth
a
taste
mole
asses
this
beer
tastes
a
lot
like
mole
asses
pretty
good
doppelbock
not
one
id
revisit
though
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
one
it
has
a
bit
of
a
roasted
flavor
in
the
finish
and
it
ended
kind
of
dry
good
flavors
just
bad
mouthfeelfinish
overall
after
hearing
this
one
costs
around
10
dollars
a
bottle
so
for
two
dollars
its
ok
not
really
the
best
just
not
terrible
o
much
more
bitter
than
im
used
to
for
the
style
instead
of
caramel
and
sweet
dark
fruit
this
doppelbock
tastes
of
lemons
and
molasses

a
bottle
in
canada
have
your
friend
buy
one
and
then
go
rock
paper
scissors
for
the
cool
dog
tag
this
beer
made
for
a
stellar
drinking
experience
true
it
tastes
a
lot
like
a
dopplebock
however
the
caramelization
of
the
wort
on
the
hot
stones
during
the
steinbeer
process
does
add
a
lot
of
depth
and
intensity
to
the
malt
flavor
if
youre
a
fan
of
malt
bombs
you
have
got
to
try
this
beer
or
some
other
traditional
steinbier
be
advised
though
that
this
beer
wont
relinquish
all
of
its
secrets
if
you
just
absentmindedly
sip
it
while
watching
television
youve
got
to
concentrate
and
tune
in
all
your
senses
do
that
and
this
beer
will
reward
you
overall
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
even
after
over
two
years
in
the
bottle
not
as
sweet
and
fruity
as
some
but
very
easy

a

not

big
not

and
if
i
may
say
quite
close

just

however
the

of
toasted

and
some
minerallike

on

this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
minerallike
flavors
are
a
bit
off
putting
flavorful
but
simple
easy
drinker
the
body
is
medium
maybe
a
bit
light
for
a
doppel
and
while
a
crisp
note
opens
it
out
and
its
fairly
smooth
it
goes
a
little
flat
poured
a
half

creamy

which
held
solid
at

but
ended
up
rapidly
deflating
the
body
is
a
dark
raw
umber
brown
almost
coffee
it
smells
very
nicely
of
deep
malt
kind
of
like
fresh
rye
bread
too
the
taste
also
is
malty
but
a
little
less
than
the
smell
and
i
pretty
much
only
get
malt
out
of
it
the
body
is
quite
light
more
so
than
id
have
expected
from
such
a
dark
beer
not
the
best
one
i
have
had
and
i
can
firmly
say
now
that
this
beer
is
best
enjoyed
as
fresh
as
possible
i
would
have
expected
a
dopplebock
to
age
reasonably
well
and
not
be
terrible
in
a
year
or
so
but
this
is
likely
going
to
be
a
drainpour

overall
i
dont
really
know
why
but
this
bottle
grabbed
my
attention
and
i
had
a
good
feeling
about
it
needless
to
say
i
was
pretty
let
down
being
produced
in
09
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
just
past
its
prime
id
definitely
like
to
try
it
fresh
but
i
do
not
recommend
drinking
this
beer
with
substantial
age
i
dont
find
this
very
drinkable
but
its
certainly
an
interesting
catalog
of
flavors
not
often
encountered
tastes
like
an
elderly
english

of
some
sort

also

a

theres

to

a
good

i
pick
up

touch

but
mostly
a
syrupy
figgishness
as
well
as
some
caramel
and
dark
chocolate
also
some
fruit
flavors
akin
to
dark

andor

quality

that
isnt

the

very

d
this
is
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
ive
tried
recently
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
fairly
solid
doppelbock
which
appears
quite
impressive
but
is
slightly
above
average
for
the
style
at
5
for
a
bottle
ill
probably
forgo
further
adventures
with
this
beer
super
rich
malt
bomb
upfront
toasted
malt
and
an
awesome
yeast
give
the
palate
a
great
swirl
of
depp
roasted
cereal
and
bread
grains
flavors
of
plums
and
prunes
with
a
little
black
cherry
abound
a
little
alcoholic
warmth
and
a
soft
yet
syrupy
palate
finish
it
off
the
finish
does
have
a
slight
too
earthy
flavor
it
takes
away
from
the
depth
of
malt
flavors
would
i
buy
more
of
it
it
was
worth
trying
once
but
i
doubt
ill
buy
another
bottle
as
there
is
too
much
else
out
there
that
i
still
need
to
try
notes
i
passed
over
this
one
for
a
long
while
at
my
favorite
spot
and
am
completely
regretfull
i
did
i
really
like
this
beer
alot
and
suggest
it
to
anyone
granitbock
in
my
humble
opinion
is
the
single
best
beer
these
guys
brew
granted
ive
only
had
three
offerings
from
them
so
far
if
youre
a
big
fan
of
deutsch
doppels
then
4
99
isnt
too
much
to
spend
on
500
ml
of
mediumdark
mostly
malty
bittersweet
enjoyment
d
all
things
considered
this
could
a
beer
fanatics
session
beer
not
too
high
in
abv
and
certainly
easy
to
put
away
if
you
have
the
palate
for
maltier
beers
d
my
first
steinbier
and
it
was
pretty
interesting
i
actually
liked
it
quite
a
bit
dont
know
if
i
would
drink
a
ton
of
it
in
a
sitting
but
i
finished
my
glass
reviewed
on
192010
bottle
pours
brown
with
a
small
ring
of
white
head
aroma
of
overcooked
vegetables
raisins
flavor
is
much
of
the
same
with
sweet
malt
raisin
prune
some
crackery
notes
and
overcooked
vegetables
an
interesting
concept
but
to
me
didnt
improve
the
beer
although
that
wouldve
been
a
freaky
beer

been
looking
forward
to

ample
carbonation
feeds
a
lasting
head
its
malty
on
the
nose
heavily
caramelized
but
also
very
earthy
mineral
almost
metallic
hops
seem
to
be
buried
beneath
it
all
the
palate
shares
the
same
mineral
and
earthy
notes
its
semisweet
very
caramelized
though
not
as
metallic
as
i
was
expecting
the
use
of
hot
granite
in
the
wort
does
add
a
unique
mineral
quality
to
the
beer
but
its
not
overwhelming
i
enjoyed
this
far
more
than
i
was
expecting
d
quite
drinkable
with
a
smooth
rich
malt
profile
there
is
enough
complexity
from
the
dark
sugary
notes
to
keep
the
beer
interesting
but
it
is
still
smooth
and
well
balanced
the
hops
are
just
sufficient
to
keep
the
malt
from
becoming
cloying
and
they
provide
a
herbal
bite
that
lingers
on
the
palate
not
terrible
to
drink
but
those
metallic
flavors
really
hang
around
d
very
nicely
drinkable
a
good
doppelbock
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
ive
had
d
the
beer
was
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
definitely
consider
trying
this
beer
again
given
its
unique
style
with
the
hot
granite
stones
caramelizing
the
sugars
in
the
malt
no
traces
of
alcohol
are
detectable
in
the

thanks
dave
d
i
would
not
buy
it
again
but
if
it
was
at
a
party
i
could
go
for
a
few
this
one
is
oddball
but
tasty
definitely
one
to
look
for
in
the
late
spring
d
a
very
drinkable
dopplebock
based
on
the
label
i
thought
this
would
have
been
a
steinbier
and
i
was
expecting
a
little
smokiness
accordingly
this
tastes
more
like
a
solid
quite
drinkable
dopplebock
drinkability
better
than
many
doppelbocks
yet
cant
reach
the
heights
of
the
best

any

but
it
can
get
a

sweet
keeping
the
drinkability
down
a
tada
pretty
good
doppelbock
beer
alcohol
does
show
but
still
pretty
drinkable
a
bit
too
sweet
and
boozy
though
a
decent
sweet
warming
sipper
very
almost
too
caramelish
an
interesting
beer
really
sticks
in
the
mouth
i
like
it
drinkability
no
trouble
here
finishing
my
portion
a
fine
upstanding
bock
providing
you
likem
sweet
and
malty
drinkability
though
the
abv
isnt
much
of
a
factor
in
the
drinking
i
cant
say
id
yearn
for
more
when
im
done
here
its
good
but
not
inspiring
i
can
see
quite
a
few
shades
of
brown
in
my
glass
right
now
if
youd
like
a
brief
selection
grab
the
box
of
96
crayons
and
read
the
sides
of
those
that
at
least
vaguely
look
brown
or
i
suppose
you
could
just
look
at
a
glass
of
granitbock
for
yourself
either
way
i
realize
that
ive
been
circumventing
a
real
description
so
ill
fill
in
some
gaps
by
saying
that
the
core
is
lovely
dark
mahogany
and
as
the
eye
prgrosses
outward
this
bleeds
through
a
few
shades
into
a
rosy
walnut
a
deep
haze
pervades
throughout
not
quite
as
pervasive
is
the
aroma
though
ive
tended
to
find
bocks
somewhat
lacking
in
the
scent
department
whats
there
is
some
weak
cinnamon
brown
sugar
and
wheat
as
weak
as
they
have
been
for
me
i
have
enjoyed
their
grainyspicy
quality
and
even
better
this
translates
beautifully
in
the
taste
reprising
their
roles
are
the
cinnamon
sugar
and
wheat
but
a
woodiness
and
nuttiness
are
also
present
culminating
in
a
nice
almondlaced
aftertaste
that
lounges
about
for
awhile
sinking
into
its
newlypurchased
muscular
sofa
i
feel
this
bit
helps
distinguish
this
particular
brew
from
its
similar
cousins
the
familiar
familial
traits
of
medium
body
light
carbonation
and
sevefrely
smooth
feel
are
all
here
and
i
think
baldness
is
as
well
but
its
still
too
soon
to
know
for
sure
as
much
as
i
often
feel
bored
with
them
i
always
find
myself
enjoying
my
time

the
bocks

drinkability
is
good
not
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
but
a
good
brew
i
really
wanted
to
like
granitbock
what
with
being
from
austria
and
a
steinbier
and
all
a
pity
you
cannot
win
them
all
granitbock
is
decent
but
for
the
price
is
difficult
to
recommend
pours
a
murky
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
small
and
short
lived
head
looks
flat
after
settling
the
aroma
is
not
overly
strong
but
has
the
traditional
dopplebock
aromas
a
bit
meaty
with
some
raisin
notes
the
taste
is
big
with
the
dark
fruits
raisin
in
particular
light
roasted
meat
honey
and
iron
again
not
very
robust
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
though
it
drinks
light
there
is
a
tingley
carbonation
and
it
finishes
sweet
an
average
dopplebock
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
as
the
dark
fruit
flavors
are
predominate
i
would
like
to
see
a
touch
more
of
a
roasted
malt
presence
to
add
some
depth
it
was
interesting
to
try
and
id
try
another
stone
beer
but
the
underlying
bock
has
to
be
a
little
better
to
begin
with
not
worth
the
price
of
admission
5
49
for
sure
sweet
brown
sugar
and
caramel
aroma
very
malty
and
only
mildly
toasty
the
flavor
follows
suit
big
brown
sugary
doppel
flavors
with
little
in
the
way
of
smoked
flavor
its
chewy
rich
and
supple
with
a
mild
apple
flavor
from
the
yeast
not
bad
to
try
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
to
return
to
over
drier
doppelbocks
like
asambock
and
celebrator
drinkability
this
is
a
slow
sipping
beer
that
is
a
bit
too
sweet
to
drink
quickly
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
malty
beer
this
one
will
work
would
i
buy
more
of
it
it
was
worth
trying
once
but
i
doubt
ill
buy
another
bottle
as
there
is
too
much
else
out
there
that
i
still
need
to
try
drinkability
is
great
i
could
have
had
a
lot
more
of
this
i
had
this
beer
in
a
pilsner
glass
it
was
a
medium
brown
color
with
some
red
highlights
a
medium
sized
tan
head
strong
malt
aroma
some
dark
fruit
sweet
big
malt
taste
sweet
raisin
this
was
a
chewy
beer
it
reminded
me
of
the
brown
bread
i
used
to
eat
with
my
baked
beans
very
nice
5
50
per
5l
bottle
at
knightly
spirits
in
orlando
fl
this
brew
pours
a
clear
brownishdark
red
and
theres
a
small
but
lasting
head
carbonation
leans
toward
the
low
side
but
is
not
inappropriate
for
the
style
theres
a
superb
rich
toffee
aroma
in
this
beer
that
most
american
breweries
never
come
close
to
emulating
when
trying
to
brew
a
bock
the
flavor
is
even
richer
than
the
aroma
the
delicious
bock
flavor
in
this
beer
is
also
something
which
is
rarely
found
in
bocks
brewed
outside
of
austria
and
germany
im
really
digging
the
malty
caramelized
toffee
flavor
of
this
brew
this
is
an
incredibly
smooth
doppelbock
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
a
while
theres
a
strong
maltiness
but
thats
what
i
like
in
a
doppelbock
a
little
more
carbonation
would
make
it
less
syrupy
but
its
excellent
just
the
way
it
is
this
beer
is
too
expensive
but
it
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
traditional
doppelbock
flavor
is
sweet
malt
through
and
through
with
caramel
and
toffee
some
biscuity
notes
and
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
again
no
hops
to
be
found
there
is
just
a
faint
wisp
of
bitter
alcohol
on
the
finish
but
overall
this
is
a
malt
lovers
beer
not
overly
complex
but
certainly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
a
damn
fine
bock
for
this
granitestater
this
is
my
kind
of
beer
much
of
the
time
and
the
only
thing
that
limits
its
drinkability
for
me
is
the
price
per
bottle
a
very
good
option
i
look
forward
to
this
on
tap
not
really
much
to
say
about
this
one
unfortunately
its
a
little
on
the
dull
side
but
good
if
you
want
to
chug
your
doppelbocks
i
suppose
pours
a
light
tealike
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
that
recedes
quickly
and
leaves
traces
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
the
caramelized
malts
and
fairly
sweet
with
hints
of
a
toasted
character
and
spices
in
the
back
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
with
caramel
malts
and
a
bit
more
sugary
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
for
the
style
with
decent
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
bock
and
certainly
original
in
the
brewing
process
on
tap
at
the
brick
store
pub
according
to
the
menu
white
hot
granite
stones
are
dropped
into
this
brew
to
get
its
caramel
smoothness
others
have
done
this
as
well
and
it
does
taste
somewhat
similar
pours
dark
chestnut
with
a
very
nice
head
and
some
decent
lacing
smells
fruity
and
malty
with
clean
caramel
throughout
tastes
richly
fruity
with
caramel
somewhat
sweet
and
with
fairly
sumptous
flavors
without
being
heavy
some
slight
char
on
the
finish
but
light
and
clean
thrroughout
quite
soft
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
pretty
much
as
advertised
this
was
a
nice

overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
though
its
not
as
rich
as
some
of
the
better
doppelbocks
still
i
like
the
flavors
and
could
have
a
lot
of
these
if
the
abv
were
a
bit
lower
worth
a
shot
if
for
nothing
else
than
the
granite
an
interesting
new
beer
not
bad
at
all
good
beer
minus
the
vinegar
notes
moral
of
the
story
didnt
age
well
my
score
will
be
the
current
average
to
avoid
skewing
the
average
because
of
the
beers
age
o
the
closest
american
made
doppelbock
to
the
original
german
versions
ive
ever
had
i
didnt
see
this
brew
in
2013
and
i
hope
its
not
completely
gone
very
underrated
and
under
appreciated
doppelbock
glbc
make
a
lot
of
great
ales
but
i
dont
think
any
american
brewery
does
lagers
like
they
do
lagers
are
forgotten
in
todays
beer
universe
but
im
telling
you
right
now
this
as
is
all
glbc
lagers
some
of
the
best
on
the
planet
if
this
is
released
again
grab
it
and
try
it
its
a
top
notch
doppelbock
o
rockin
but
a
little
too
hoppy
for
my
taste
concerning
doppelbocks
warm
lingering
alcohol
booze
isnt
infectious
but
nicely
done
for
a
good
spring
beer
final
thoughts
the
doppelrock
pretty
much
met
my
expectations
a
very
malty
brew
that
has
a
lot
of
great
flavors
but
is
not
mindblowing
just
a
good
beer
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
id
want
to
try
it
fresh
o
doppelbocks
are
a
malt
lovers
dream
and
this
one
was
quite
enjoyable
but
very
sweet
overall
yet
another
damn
delicious
offering
from
great
lakes
my
favorite
brewery
on
gods
green
earth
when
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
dark
rich
cola
colored
body
with
a
small
tan
head
that
layed
down
quickly
to
a
nice
thin
lace
the
smell
is
of
rich
dark
fruit
and
roasted
malt
the
taste
follows
the
smell
but
with
much
richer
flavor
of
the
dark
fruit
and
some
chocolate
notes
on
the
back
of
the
tonuge
the
mouth
feel
is
very
nice
creamy
and
smooth
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
by
great
lakes
this
one
has
a
real
pleasant
fragrance
to
it
flavor
is
heartier
and
a
bit
more
robust
than
i
would
have
imagined
fruit
tones
seem
reminiscent
of
something
on
the
tip
of
my
mind
but
far
away
from
my
tongue
translated
i
cant
figure
out
what
fruit
this
reminds
me
of
i
usually
cant
stand
bocks
or
doppelbocks
but
this
one
is
nice
its
always
cool
to
be
able
to
try
a
style
that
you
dont
really
care
for
yet
are
still
able
to
aprpeciate
it
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
dopplebock
not
as
boozy
as
some
ive
had
recently
i
could
definitely
pick
this
up
again
and
at
four
dollars
a
four
pack
i
think
i
will
o
a
very
good
dopplebock
every
time
i
have
this
style
of
beer
im
pleasantly
surprised
i
think
im
too
hopforward
with
my
beer
styles
lately
this
one
is
a
keeper
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
because
its
from
great
lakes
if
youve
ever
had
a
great
lakes
beer
then
you
know
what
im
talking
about
i
would
say
that
it
didnt
exceed
them
it
somewhat
match
my
expectations
overall
its
a
very
good
dry
roasted
doppelbock
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
overall
not
the
best
in
the
style
but
certainly
one
worth
trying
if
you
can
find
it
this
is
a
big
rich
lager
with
some
nice
dark
toasty
and
bready
characteristics
dense
full
flavor
is
quite
satisfying
though
not
as
complex
as
the
best
examples
of
the
style
excellent
nonetheless

nice

overall
not

my

overall
one
tasty
brew
it
has
great
flavors
a
wonderful

gives
you
the

it

sit

some

and

in
there
as
well
the
taste
starts
sweet
with
a
firm

presence
the
sweetness
is
balanced
nicely
by
toasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
roast
nice
balance
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
light
for
style
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
tasty
example
of
the
style
i
like
how
the
sweetness
is
kept
in
check
cheers
oreminds
me
a
bit
of
a
doppelbockdubbel
hybrid
but
the
combination
doesnt
work
i
like
the
upfront
taste
but
it
doesnt
end
well
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
ive
had
definitely
opts
for
a
more
complex
malt
character
over
heavy
sweetness
glad
i
was
able
to
pick
a
4pack
up
while
traveling
great
lakes
is
a
favorite
brewery
of
mine
and
again
i
am
reminded
why
overall
very
solid
doppelbock
i
love
the
nose
on
this
beer
pretty
complex
the
taste
was
less
so
and
it
was
a
bit
drying
this
would
be
a
very
good
beer
to
try
on
draft
oexcellent
beer
and
very
drinkable
o
skip
the
chocolate
dessert
tray
and
make
this
your
last
course
of
the
night
this
doppelbock
features
rich
chocolate
malts
with
just
the
right
balance
of
hops
to
make
them
delicious
without
being
heavy
or
filling
could
easily
enjoy
several
of
these
over
postdinner
conversation
without
feeling
like
ive
cleaned
out
a
godiva
factory
another
winner
from
great
lakes
btw
while
this
review
is
based
on
tasting
from
a
bottle
i
remember
the
servings
ive
had
both
this
year
and
last
on
tap
as
being
even
better
its
one
of
those
beers
where
the
delivery
is
even
better
than
the
anticipation
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
really
expected
it
to
be
a
more
solidly
medium
bodied
beer
that
said
it
does
roll
over
the
tongue
well
even
though
it
is
slightly
sticky
o
not
sure
how
i
missed
this
brew
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
i
need
to
grab
a
four
pack
asap
o
this
beer
looks
and
smells
phenomenal
and
the
taste
is
very
good
solid
overall

i
really
enjoy
this
doppelbock
it
really
is
like
liquid
bread
in
a
lot
of
ways
and
thats
what
i
dig
about
it
i
dont
go
for
all
that
many
maltcentric
beers
but
this
ones
a
keeper
in
my
book
overall
it
is
great
roasted
beer
without
an
overwhelming
amount
of
malt
great
lakes
keeps
great
styles
simple
and
usually
that
produces
some
great
beers
this
ones
not
exceptional
but
near
the
upper
rung
among
americanmade

it

to

i
wanted
a
good
beer
but
there
are
better
doppelbocks
out

to
try
first
o
doppelbock

not

my
more
known
styles

of
the
ones
i
have
had
this
is
a
good
example
of
what
the
style
is
wonder
how
it
would
fare
with
some
age
overall
i
really
like
the
flavors
presented

i
thought
the

a
bit
of
fruit
that
i
cant
quite
place
a
nice
little
bite
on
the
lips
in
the
front
end
that
gives
way
to
a
nice
rich
malty
mouthfeel
that
finishes
clean
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
theres
a
decent
bit
of
carbonation
that
mixes
with
the
malt
to
keep
it
from
being
too
rich
thick
or
alcohol
heavy
another
solid
offering
from
great
lakes
notes
despite
the
good
words
i
put
into
the
taste
section
of
my
notes
i
gave
this
beer
and
overall
b
and
i
didnt
write
a
lot
of
words
in
the
review
so
i
guess
this
was
just
an
ok
doppelbock
a
very
easy
drinking
doppelbock
with
terrific
aromas
and
a
surprisingly
light
flavor
and
mouthfeel
a
good
gateway
into
the
style
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
got
it
a
while
back
and
has
been
sitting
in
my
cellar
for
a
while
i
dont
think
a
bit
of
age
did
any
harm
to
it
if
it
didnt
improve
it
o
again
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
the
style
so
i
may
be
overrating
this
a
bit
but
i
like
this
a
lot
this
is
a
very
interesting
complex
and
enjoyable
beer
ill
get
it
again
o
doppelrock
is
a
damn
fine
brew
a
wonderful
display
for
the
style
light
and
complex
this
one
gives
you
wave
after
wave
of
caramel
chocolate
biscuit
and
roast
goodness
while
retaining
a
lightness
and
sessionability
that
great
lakes
seems
to
have
mastered
in
most
of
its
brews
enjoy
this
one
o
easy
drinker
a
good
winter
evening
sipper
a
solid
doppelbock
deep
mahogany
in
color
with
a
light
haze
while
its
cold
but
clarifys
as
it
warms
a
bit
poured
with
a
thick
bridge
foam
that
reduced
to
light
wisps
and
a
ring
around
the
top
of
the
glass
sweet
roasted
malt
and
dark
fruit
aromas
raisins
and
figs
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
boozy
aromas
sneak
in
as
it
warms
up
smooth
thick
and
creamy
feel
sweet
roasted
malts
up
front
with
dark
fruits
and
chocalte
malt
in
the
middle
and
an
herbal
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
similar
to
aroma
theres
a
little
booziness
at
the
finish
finishes
with
a
lingering
sweet
malty
but
herbal
hop
bitterness
an
agreeably
decent
doppelbock
well
offset
by
a
counterbalancing
dryness
and
just
enough
warming
to
remind
one
of
the
imminent
summers
end
this
is
a
very
good
doppelbock
and
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
that
i
appreciate
will
continue
picking
this
one
up
o
a
unique
doppelbock
drinks
rather
nicely
for
the
rather
apparent
alcohol
definitely
worth
trying
now
i
shall
have
to
find
a
fresh
bottle
next
year
when
it
rolls
around
to
determine
a
starting
point
from
which
it
changed
nothing
about
this
beer
would
discourage
me
from
opening
another
right
after
a
nice
big
sipper
if
you
want
but
so
easy
to
drink
while
this
is
a
good
beer
this
is
not
the
way
i
like
my
dopplebocks
optimator
is
one
of
my
favorites
because
it
is
so
easy
drinking
and
clean
which
is
what
this
beer
lacks
i
would
pass
on
this
one
the
only
thing
that
falls
short
here
is
the
aroma
another
very
good
germanstyled
offering
from
the
folks
at
glbc
o
a
respectable
effort
by
great
lakes
its
not
the
best
doppelbock
you
can
get
but
you
could
do
far
worse
o
i
love
bocks
this
is
a
decent
one
for
sure
the
booze
seems
to
be
creeping
up
on
this
one
though
it
was
less
apparent
a
few
weeks
ago
from
the
same
batch
very
nice
beer
another
great
offering
from
glbc
highly
recommended
the
doppelrock
is
just
flat
out
fantastic
a
drinkable
delight
that
holds
its
own
with
the
best
german
examples
of
the
style
highly
recommended
im
going
to
look
for
this
next
time
im
up
north
o
another
great
beer
from
glbc
i
should
have
bought
another
bottle
to
age
and
compare
overall
an
exceptional
doppelbock
with
an
exceptional
name
you
could
drink
this
all
day
and
you
would
want
to
with
all
of
its
exceptional
attributes
not
really
a
summer
beer
but
the
welcome
splash
of
flavor
among
the
boring
summer
beers
is
a
great
change
of
pace
o
pretty
good
beer
full
flavored
drinkable
for
abv
and
style
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
the
hints
of
fruit
and
nuts
in
the
taste
were
very
welcome
i
would
definitely
have
another
o
great
beer
its
been
a
favorite
of
mine

its

a
pretty

one
i
wouldnt

dropping

still
a

figgy
like

with
a
tea
leaf
molasses
barley
grain
light
toast
smoke
and
some
biscuit
tastes
the
feel
is
thick
almost
chewy
very
good
example
of
the
style
as
it
feels
and
tastes
like
a
meal
o
let
that
remaining
sweetness
ferment
into
something
dry
and
this
would
go
from
pretty
good
to
great
o
could
i
drink
a
liter
of
this
maybe
if
this
was
all
i
was
planning
on
eating
for
the
majority
of
the
day
seems
like
it
could
be
filling
at
first
but
its
dry
drop
tempts
ya
the
maximator
gets
average
reviews
from
this
guy
because
i
am
not
an
overly
huge
fan
of
doppels
nevertheless
the
beer
poured
a
very
nice
clear
amber
with
thin
slightly
off
white
head
that
is
not
lacing
the
scent
is
very
malty
and
sweet
the
taste
is
intensely
malty
with
that
belgiumy
europeany
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
subtle
carbonation
overall
its
not
bad
but
its
not
preferred
german
precision
incredibly
easy
to
drink

its

easy
drinking
maple
syrupy
brown
with
big
bubbles
and
almost
no

looks
a

lifeless
smells
mostly
of
drambuie
honey
caramelized
sugar
malt
syrup
rummy
booze
and
a
touch
of
indistinct
herbs
and
spices
tastes
pretty
much
as
it
smells
but
with
a
weird
earthy
sherrylike
quality
and
a
hint
of
something
like
licorice
or
black
cardamom
that
reminds
me
of
a
chinese
apothecary
all
of
this
might
be
nice
in
a
beer
with
more
body
and
depth
but
this
feels
shallow
emaciated
and
weirdly
sour
not
like
lambic
sour
more
like
raw
bread
dough
sour
not
a
good
example
of
this
style
and
in
general
a
total
disappointment
overall
a
strong
4
a
very
wellcrafted
beer
which
definitely
masks
the
7
5
alcohol
percentage
its
fruit
and
caramel
flavor
deep
aroma
and
smooth
finish
make
this
a
very
good
beer
definitely
a
redrink
this
beer
is
definitely
not
what
it
should
be
i
dont
remember
ever
having
it
at
augustiner
bräustuben
but
this
is
not
up
to
augstinerbräus
standards
overall
a
very
solid
doppelbock
that
is
traditional
with
the
style
very
tasty
brew
great
malt
complexity
more
carbonation
would
help
very
great
flavors
abound
and
the
beers
easy
drinkable
feel
and
lack
of
heat
overall
makes
this
one
id
revisit
if
possible
however
i
would
prefer
to
have
this
fresh
as
the
hop
character
is
really
missing
not
as
intense
or
malty
as
other
doppelbocks
which
is
definitely
a
plus
relatively
balanced
almost
drinks
like
a
helles
lager
on
steroids
worth
trying
for
sure
i
have
noticed
that
many
reviews
seem
like
they
are
tasting
different
beers
the
bottles
are
not
dated
and
i
have
found
this
beer
to
taste
very
differently
depending
on
how
old
it
is
i
have
had
this
beer
off
the
tap
in
munich
so
i
have
some
vague
idea
of
how
it
is
fresh
as
the
beer
ages
some
of
the
sweet
and
bready
notes
vanish
and
the
hops
become
more
and
more
prominent
this
means
that
what
at
once
a
fairly
rich
beer
full
bodied
beer
becomes
a
drier
thinner
and
inferior
version
of
itself
a
perfectly
serviceable
doppelbock
went
well
with
the
weather
oddly
enough
if
you
dont
like
malty
beverages
even
handling
a
full

might
be

the

still
a
very
well
crafted
german
creation

picking
up

taste
is
much
the

lots
of
burnt

flavors
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
very
sweet
flavors
that
make
this
one
a
slow
sipper
rjt
an
okay
doppelbock
its
not
what
id
call
a
great
one
its
not
nearly
as
complex
as
my
favorites
of
the
style
id
save
this
one
for
purchasing
when
its
on
sale
perhaps
deep
ruby
red
in
color
with
excellent
clarity
poured
with
a
short
beige
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
rich
cap

with
mellow

medium

with
a
delicate
rich
velvety
smoothness

sweetness
up
front
floral
hops
through
the
middle
and
toward
the
end
finished
with
a
sugary
sticky
sweet
malty
finish
with
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
and
floral
hops
to
the
point
i
can
only
drink
one
of
these
too
rich
and
the
dark
sugary
profile
makes
it
a
one
and
done
for
me
it
is
an
okay
to
midland
as
far
as
doppelbocks
go
a
great
tasting
doppelbock
here
tastes
of
salty
caramel
dark
berries
with
a
nice
warming
alcohol
level
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
thin
not
overbearing
or
heavy
overall
a
nice
tasting
beer
that
makes
me
want
to
branch
out
a
little
more
with
beers
from
outside
of
the
states
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
a
good
value

a
solidly
good

not

good
in

and
appearance
compared
to
other
doppelbocks
ive
had
that
being
said
its
a
tasty
beer
however
it
does
seem
to
have
a
narrow
temperature
window
where
the
flavors
are
optimal
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
the
bitterness
got
a
tad
overpowering
in
a
bad
way
as
it
warmed
up
so
one
is
enough
o
one
of
the
things
i
find
with
some
of
the
german
beers
that
have
been
around
forever
is
that
a
lot
of
them
have
such
classic
flavors
that
go
under
appreciated
these
days
of
hops
and
imperial
beers
you
want
a
malt
bomb
here
you
go
just
a
dash
of
hops
to
balance
out
the
maltiness
but
you
can
taste
the
classic
in
this
beer
and
what
the

no

of

rich
fullbodied
light
effervescence
smooth
like
liquid

phenomenal
imo
overall
impression
not
too
shabby
at
all
especially
if
youre
looking
for
some
hops
to
balance
all
the
malt
o
a
prime
example
of
it
classification
flavorful
nice
to
look
at
and
easy
to
drink
a
bit
more
fragrance
would
be
nice
but
delicate
and
delicious
overall
this
was
a
fairly
ordinary
beer
certainly
not
worth
writing
home
about
not
bad
a
pleasant
drink
but
nothing
outstanding
update
had
a
second
one
of
these
at
the
same
place
a
month
later
and
didnt
get
as
great
an
impression
still
really
good
but
didnt
pop
like
before
overall
a
brew
that
was
quite
easy
to
drink
and
had
a
nice
malty
fruity
flavor
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
a
decent
beer
on
its
own
but
probably
best
with
flavorful
sausage
the
smells
didnt
lie
this
is
sweet
and
malty
in
that
order
almost
sticky
in
consistency
and
mouthfeel
i
like
the
sweeter
maltier
brews
out
there
but
this
tested
my
resolve
i
really
enjoyed
the
first
half
of
the
tasting
but
as
the
beer
warmed
in
the
glass
my
pleasure
began
to
recede
somewhat
a
smaller
bottle
would
have
been
fine
mental
note
to
myself
only
have
330ml
bottles
of
unknown
doppelbocks
in
future
the
beer
is
a
little
syrupy
and
leaves
a
sweet
linger
on
the
tongue
but
a
nice
doppelbock
and
very
drinkable
g
a
good
doppelbock
compared
to
others
in
its
class
though
it
doesnt
stand
up
still
an
above
average
beer
this
is
full
bodied
doppelbock
that
is
very
tasty
drinkable
but
at
the
same
time
i
paid
14
for
this
lager
and
think
you
can
find
just
as
good
for
cheaper
either
way
this
lager
was
wonderful
price
point
single
purchased
for
3
25
a
short
review
because
i
want
to
get
back
to
drinking
i
really
like
this
one
i
think
this
hits
the
perfect
balance
of
sweet
hops
in
a
gemeran
beer
without
over
doing
it
or
going
so
over
the
top
on
the
malt
that
it
becomes
a
barely
wine
i
really
appreciate
this
one
overall
eh
a
good
doppelbock
but
no
where
does
it
stand
out
and
i
feel
i
overrated
a
hair
on
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
thin
tan
colored
head
on
top
that
doesnt
last
very
long
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
little
boozy
with
some
roasted
malt
aromas
too
the
taste
is
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
with
the
sweeter
malts
coming
through
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
not
very
heavy
for
a
dark
brew
overall
its
worth
trying
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
a
very
unique
beer
the
beers
appearance
is
dark
russet
with
a
bubbly
head
which
soon
recedes
to
a
half
inch
and
then
to
less
than
that
with
little
retention
the
nose
consists
of
grains
caramel
cherry
and
sugar
when
imbibed
the
initial
taste
is
that
of
a
hearty
bread
for
just
a
second
followed
by
sweet
taffy
and
tart
cherry
for
a
moderate
abv
it
doesnt
seem
like
it
the
beer
is
pretty
balanced
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
seems
just
right
for
the
level
of
strong
flavor
it
gets
smoother
as
the
temperature
goes
up
not
the
best
doppelbock
but
still
very
good
as
for
augustinerbrau
though
i
think
ill
stick
to
the
pils
drinkability
average
at
best
i
was
expecting
to
really
like
it
lean
tart
and
dry
abv
and
sour
dark
fruit
together
make
this
a
crisp
and
not
at
all
sweet
doppelbock
not
sure
its
what
i
want
but
it
certainly
does
what
it
sets
out
to
a
solid
example
of
the
style
thats
a
really
good
doppelbock
best
enjoyed
when
its
nearly
room
temperature
d
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
not
quite
as
thick
as
some
examples
of
the
style
it
has
a
fair
amount
of
dark
sugary
character
in
the
malt
profile
but
finishes
dry
enough
to
be
well
balanced
there
are
better
dopplebocks
out
there
but
this
is
definitely
worth
trying
the
aroma
was
rich
and
sweet
lots
of
great
earthy
and
grainy
notes
mixing
in
well
with
a
good
amount
of
caramel
sugar
the
flavor
followed
suit
nicely
with
the
dominant
flavor
of
caramel
really
taking
hold
some
nice
bready
malts
being
located
under
that
as
well
the
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
and
not
a
factor
at
all
nice
smooth
finish
with
the
long
lingering
flavor
of
nutty
caramel
on
the
tongue
for
a
few
minutes
afterward
o
just
an
okay
doppelbock
not
as
sweet
and
a
little
thinner
than
most
doppelbocks
ive
come
across
it
has
a
very
complex
flavor
which
i
assume
comes
from
traditional
decoction
mashing
the
caramelized
sugars
give
slightly
roasted
notes
it
accomplishes
the
stylistic
sweetness
without
coming
off
as
a
sweet
beer
achieving
excellent
balance
this
is
the
first
dopplebock
that
i
have
truly
enjoyed
o
a
different
doppelbock
with
earthy
nutty
notes
and
a
crispness
to
it
a
nice
change
from
the
viscous
malt
domination
of
some
more
traditional
dbs
pours
caramel
with
a
small
head
out
of
an
11
2oz
bottle
it
tastes
a
lot
like
a
typical
smooth
mellow
scotch
beer
easy
drinking
if
you
know
what
that
tastes
like
then
youll
understand
this
one
if
you
dont
go
read
up
on
them
the
alcohol
is
hiding
under
there
at
7
5
so
dont
stand
too
quickly
if
youve
had
a
few
the
price
is
right
here
in
seattletacoma
for
a
repeat
visit
but
i
wouldnt
set
out
for
it
anywhere
not
even
in
germany
where
its
bottled
clear
reddish
brown
body
with
a
decent
sized
head
for
the
style
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
name
maximator
id
like
if
this
beer
had
more
hops
malt
alcohol
i
guess
this
just
kind
of
seems
more
like
a
light
doppelbock
to
me
despite
that
its
still
pretty
darn
good
a
very
good
doppelbock
this
was
poured
into
a
jever
flute
with
a
clear
reddishbrown
body
with
a
tan
head
with
a
finger
and
a
half
depth
very
light
lacing
smells
very
nice
and
like
a
doppelbock
clean
malty
with
a
fruity
sweetness
the
taste
follows
through
as
i
think
crystal
malt
with
this
delicious
german
offering
paired
with
a
dinner
of
pickled
herring
in
sour
cream
and
venison
sausages
with
homemade
potato
salad
this
bold
doppelbock
stands
up
to
strong
flavors
in
the
meal
with
its
own
sweet
balance
the
7
5
abv
is
barely
noticedbut
yes
still
noticed
in
this
strong
bier
recommended
strongly
as
it
is
a
beer
with
great
flavor
aroma
and
character
yes
character
overall
definitely
a
good
beer
while
i
wouldnt
say
that
this
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
it
was
very
enjoyable
if
you
were
to
have
this
with
dinner
it
would
pair
well
with
a
dessert
or
wild
game
with
berries
but
drinking
a
whole
bottle
by
itself
i
would
not
recommend
d
the
smell
is
excellent
the
rest
is
mediocre
i
am
not
going
to
have
this
again
i
love
doppelbocks
and
this
simplify
is
okay
albeit
slightly
more
expensive
poured
into
a
celebrator
doppelbock
glass
deep
clear
amber
color
with
a
nice
khaki
head
lovely
nose
big
dark
fruit
notes
especially
prunes
raisins
dates
and
dried
cherries
ludicrous
that
this
should
emanate
from
a
lager
vivid
and
luscious
recalling
licorice
and
sees
candies
along
with
dried
fruit
the
flavor
departs
a
bit
from
the
fruitiness
to
showcase
creamy
caramel
and
molasses
but
theres
still
a
significant
unripe
raisin
note
theres
a
slight
metallic
tinge
as
well
but
its
not
nearly
as
prominent
as
in
some
lesser
doppelbocks
and
the
subtlety
actually
works
okay
with
the
other
flavors
i
dont
get
any
alcohol
on
the
palate
at
all
which
is
great
its
obviously
there
but
the
only
evidence
is
a
slight
warmth
a
slight
oiliness
and
a
slight
buzz
finishes
dry
for
a
chewy
beer
much
appreciated
this
is
honestly
up
there
with
celebrator
i
cant
believe
how
good
this
is
bravo
otherwise
it
is
an
awesome
doppelbock
milky
sauces
and
porkribs
should
ally
well
with
the
flavours
of
this
brew
they
do
munich
proud
pours
a
lovely
2
light
mocha
head
the
color
held
to
the
light
is
a
clear
deep
berry
color
smell
is
rich
malt
and
taste
is
oh
so
much
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
caramel
rich
and
with
a
substantial
finish
an
extraordinary
testimony
to
malt
id
snagged
this
as
a
single
bottle
for
a
pretty
affordable
price
and
id
say
this
is
great
for
repeats
and
even
gifts
maximator
indeed
overall
this
is
delicious
complex
sipping
brew
without
any
overpowering
harshness
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
the
flavors
were
pretty
spot
on
for
the
style
but
it
didnt
hide
its
alcohol
that
well
it
tasted
more
like
its
9
the
malts
were
just
were
they
should
be
and
had
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
and
that
dark
dried
fruit
flavor
help
tie
everything
together
one
of
these
is
enough
for
me
i
am
not
sure
i
would
seek
this
one
out
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
you
like
the
style
give
this
beer
a
try
it
represents
it
pretty
well
yes
i
am
in
full
kraut
mood
after
drinking
this
but
i
didnt
like
it
much
the
dark
malty
taste
is
not
for
me
the
aftertaste
is
nice
and
it
probably
would
go
great
with
food
cutting
through
other
flavors
it
really
is
a
well
made
beer
and
a
lot
more
interesting
than
the
helles
from
this
brewery
but
it
doesnt
work
well
for
me
i
dont
want
to
buy
it
again
this
is
authentic
tasting
and
grows
on
me
as
it
warms
but
has
trouble
matching
the
st
victorious
i
consumed
this
evening
d
maybe
lacks
depth
of
malt
complexity
compared
to
celebrator
and
korbinian
but
still
satisfying
clean
tasting
and
alcohol
content
well
hidden
definitely
a
doppelbock
that
leans
more
to
the
toasted
attenuated
side
this
is
a
quality
doppelbock
that
hits
nearly
all
the
right
notes
definitely
worth
seeking
out
and
should
be
considered
one
of
the
avatars
of
the
sweetdoppel
style
im
surprised
this
is
only
7
5
there
seems
to
be
room
for
more
alcohol
fairly
smooth
and
dark
dried
fruity
not
what
im
used
to
in
munich
beers
glad
to
check
it
off
the
list
solid
beer
but
makes
me
crave

optimator
two

on
a
clear
sparkling
deep

with

little

medium
creamy

that
quickly
recedes
and
leaves
some
spotty

behind
thin
collar
as
it
fades
down
the
nose
brings
some
light
dark

well
as
a

quite
a
bit
of

there
as

quaffable
doppelbock
the
alcohol
is
masterfully
hidden
behind
the
malt
curtain
and
the
yeast
helps
bring
some
interesting
complexity
to
the
flavor
drink
is
ok
hint
of
warming
booze
slight
sticky
and
syrupy
nothing
too
heavy
drinkability
not
my
favorite
doppel
and
i
expected
alot
from
augustiner
decent
poured
from
12
oz
glass
into
dimpled
mug
pours
dark
amber
with
a
small
bubbly
white
head
strong
and
sweet
malty
aroma
with
huge
notes
of
fruit
caramel
and
toffee
flavor
is
lighter
than
expected
but
semisweet
and
fruity
a
bit
of
spice
towards
the
finish
and
some
earthy
tobacco
notes
palate
is
medium
slightly
watery
but
still
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
balanced
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
d
not
the
best
doppelbock
ive
had
but
i
could
drink
several
of
these
just
the
same
very
drinkable
pretty
good
drinkability
for
a
thickbodied
sweet
brew
i
could
have
handled
another
or
perhaps
two
though
the
7
5
is
noticable
to
me
after
one
glass
d
this
one
was
provided
to
me
by
a
friend
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
until
i
learned
the
steep
price
good
solid
beer
to
enjoy
on
special
occasions
d
strongly
surprised
how
amazing
this
beer
is
warm
got
sweeter
will
get
this
for
a
special
occasion
in
the
near
future
a
bit
pricey
i
really
think
the
nose
on
this
is
good
but
there
are
so
many
things
that
dissapoint
me
about
this
beer
that
i
really
do
not
want
it
ever
again
even
though
you
could
drink
it
easily
a
nice
doppelbock
that
is
a
bit
mellower
than
some
others
and
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
as
it
helps
drinkability
and
makes
it
a
bit
more
unique
quite
tasty
but
unfortunately
also
quite
pricey
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
and
some
good
lacing
smells
of
dark
fruits
sugar
malts
and
some
hidden
hops
tastes
of
sweet
malts
chocolate
coffee
caramel
brown
sugar
and
maybe
some
prune
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
very
nice
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
beer
would
definitely
like
to
drink
again
however
15
price
tag
is
a
little
steep
for
the
style
its
pretty
good
for
me
the
drinkability
takes
a
hit
dexcellent
drinkability
price
and
availability
cheers
im
bumping
this
up
a
bit
the
drinkability
is
insane
and
it
becomes
a
bit
more
balanced
as
it
warms
up
dnice
version
of
the
style
very
drinkable
but
nothing
outstanding
i
would
drink
this
again
if
given
limited
choices
clear
deep
red
colour
with
a
meager
cap
of
fine
bubbles
that
dispersed
quickly
not
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
clean
malt
aroma
that
was
quite
light
overall
grain
light
caramel
slight
dried
fruit
more
earthy
than
juicy
light
bitterness
lots
of
caramel
and
dried
fruit
sweetness
light
alcohol
towards
the
end
malty
all
the
way
through
medium
to
full
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
smooth
and
nearly
creamy
mild
alcohol
warmth
pretty
good
overall
nice
malt
character
this
is
bock
is
good
in
an
average
kind
of
way
solid
but
not
exceptional
d
wow
what
a
difference
not
coming
in
a
green
bottle
can
make
this
is
fantastic
great
full
flavor
and
thick
body
the
aroma
is
average
but
the
taste
just
takes
this
to
the
top
perhaps
an
old
bottle
will
rereview
when
possible
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
its
certainly
full
bodied
and
has
a
good
carbonation
level
it
could
finish
a
little
cleaner
drinkability
is
about
the
same
as
well
the
beer
gets
a
little
better
as
it
warms
up
i
like
it
a
decent
dopplebock
i
would
say
that
if
you
mixed
a
thick
malty
ale
with
a
kolsch
you
would
get
this
beer
it
is
thick
and
flavorful
the
smell
is
delicious
the
only
odd
thing
about
it
is
some
bits
of
it
was
almost
watery
while
other
tastes
were
not
this
is
a
good
beer
though
a
clear
dark
amber
pour
of
a
moderate
carbonation
nose
intensely
of
caramel
toasted
malt
a
bit
sweet
as
expected
on
the
palate
but
it
quickly
fades
out
just
dropping
off
the
palate
honey
brown
sugar
and
toasted
almonds
fading
of
to
subtlities
nice
and
smooth
lacking
a
bit
of
dimension
in
comparison
to
some
overall
great
doppelbock
incredible
depth
of
malt
complexity
and
richness
with
a
kiss
of
hops
keeping
it
from
being
over
the
top
drinkability
takes
a
bit
of
a
hit
due
to
its
richness
but
i
want
to
have
another
thanks
to
the
awesome
malt
character
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
a
very
tasty
brew
the
next
time
i
want
a
classic
old
world
doppelbock
i
will
be
seeking
this
out
taste
is
great
toasty
and
malty
brown
sugar
and
dates
mediumfull
body
rich
but
easy
to
drink
dark
fruit
flavors
in
the
midpalate
lead
into
a
toasty
brown
sugar
finish
notes
would
certainly
buy
another
solid
flavor
all
around
and
nothing
lacking
d
the
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
any
traces
of
alcohol
are
barely
perceptible
in
the
taste
or
aroma
serving
type
bottle
overall
a
pretty
average
doppel
one
major
complaint
unlike
the
similar
paulaner
salvator
there
is
no
bottling
date
to
be
found
in
30
years
of
drinking
this
beer
ive
gotten
the
odd
case
with
bitter
burnt
flavors
obviously
expired
but
when
fresh
i
love
it
d
overall
a
very
enjoyable
doppelbock
maximator
delivers
great
dichotomy
with
this
brew
giving
both
refreshing
and
rich
their
share
of
the
limelight
definitely
worth
picking
up
dont
be
afraid
of
the
bland
packaging
overall
a
viscous
malt
bomb
sweet
and
sticky
major
earthy
dark
fruit
notes
if
you
like
a
good
dopplebock
you
need
to
try
this
one
final
thoughts
good
easy
intense
but
manageable
this
is
the
curveball
of
the
doppelbock
family
but
ill
be
drinking
this
again
simplistic
yet
tasty
ill
definitely
look
for
this
again
in
the
future
d
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
but
it
is
quite
filling
skip
the
salvator
maximator
is
by
far
superior
d
even
though
its
not
the
best
doppelbock
ive
had
and
it
doesnt
really
shine
in
any
particular
category
it
is
very
drinkable
goes
down
easy
and
continues
to
please
as
it
warms
up
by
far
my
favorite
doppelbock
d
all
and
all
a
decent
beer
with
drinkable
charactoristics
for
the
style
overall
a
great
doppelbock
one
of
the
best
on
the
market
augustiner
lager
beers
are
phenomenal
to
say
the
least
and
this
is
another
fine
example
of
their
craft
if
you
like
sweet
doppelbocks
this
is
your
baby
a
complete
malt
bomb
recommended
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
duvel
tulip
bit
of
a
gusher
when
opened
poured
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
finger
of
light
tan
head
rich
malty
aroma
with
some
molasses
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
it
has
a
big
malty
base
more
molasses
and
some
dark
fruit
long
malty
finish
smooth
and
very
easy
drinking
for
such
a
big
beer
d
perfect
for
a
cold
night
but
there
are
much
better
examples
of
this
style
in
my
book
a
good
but
not
great
doppel
to
me
purchased
this
12
oz
bottle
from
big
z
beverage
in
huntington
ny
this
beer
pours
a
deep
reddishbrown
color
with
a
small
head
that
fades
away
quickly
aromas
are
of
caramelized
malts
and
dark
fruits
taste
is
the
same
the
alcohol
makes
its
presence
but
does
not
overpower
all
in
all
an
attractive
doppelbock
that
is
flavorful
relatively
inexpensive
and
is
always
available
a
must
try
beer
is
medium
bodied
really
smooth
coats
the
mouth
with
nice
forward
sweetness
and
a
good
finish
there
is
a
slight
fruit
like
aftertaste
almost
sweet
apple
flavored
i
am
a
huge
doppelbock
fan
and
this
is
a
repeat
for
sure
id
have
to
call
this
beer
classic
its
not
a
celebrator
or
consecrator
but
it
holds
its
own
worth
a
shot
if
you
want
to
try
the
style
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
a
great
session
beer
when
im
not
going
anywhere
poured
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
minimal
head
and
minor
lace
a
strong
malt
smell
of
roasted
burnt
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
with
a
little
hop
bitterness
a
basic
brew
but
a
good
one
has
a
medium
body
that
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
chocolatey
taste
along
with
some
caramel
and
syrupiness
beer
is
slightly
sticky
a
slight
fruit
taste
along
with
some
hop
bitterness
that
gives
off
a
slightly
dry
finish
a
quality
dopplebock
that
hides
the
abv
well
and
is
an
enjoyable
drink
12oz
bottle
pours
clear
mahogany
with
a
modest
light
beige
head
that
dies
quickly
smells
strongly
of
caramel
malt
and
brown
sugar
some
dark
raisinlike
fruits
very
sweet
taste
is
also
sweet
with
many
of
the
same
almost
canesyruplike
characteristics
but
also
a
distinct
slightly
chocolaty
roasted
malt
taste
that
makes
it
more
pleasant
sweet
finish
but
not
overpoweringly
so
mediumfull
though
slightly
syrupy
body
a
decent
doppelbock
overall
though
its
admittedly
not
my
favorite
style
good
thickness
and
retention
to
the
creamy
brown
head
eventually
settles
into
a
thin
layer
across
the
surface
the
lacing
doesnt
stick
fairly
clear
brown
liquid
with
equal
red
and
orange
influences
few
bubbles
to
be
seen
the
nose
comes
up
with
suitable
doses
of
caramel
milk
chocolate
raisin
apricot
and
bing
cherry
fruit
theres
a
smoky
touch
along
with
peat
moss
forest
floor
matter
and
dried
oranges
the
bread
notes
are
dense
like
pumpernickel
little
airiness
mediumbodied
nowhere
near
as
sweet
as
one
might
have
expected
has
a
mineral
water
sort
of
freshness
and
pétillance
not
really
carbonated
in
the
strong
sense
as
a
result
it
does
not
have
density
and
flows
by
at
a
pace
detrimental
to
the
flavors
soaking
in
soda
bread
raisin
bread
rye
and
grains
elevate
here
the
caramel
creamed
coffee
and
butterscotch
components
fade
off
the
cherry
apricot
peach
fruit
finds
some
traction
in
the
midpalate
warming
doesnt
seem
to
help
flavor
expressivity
as
it
ends
the
stage
mostly
held
by
the
herbaceous
earthiness
not
sure
what
the
goal
was
here
this
poured
a
clear
dark
mahogany
with
some
tan
head
it
smelled
like
bready
yeast
and
roasted
barley
with
some
rich
caramel
malt
and
a
bit
of
raisin
it
tasted
like
roasted
barley
and
dark
caramel
with
some
copper
and
coffee
and
a
bit
of
smoke
it
was
slightly
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
good
solid
doppelbock
it
wasnt
quite
as
rich
as
the
top
doppelbocks
ive
tried
but
it
still
had
a
nice
clean
flavor
with
good
body
it
hid
the
alcohol
well
also
so
it
was
quite
easy
to
drink
nice
autumn
beer
this
is
a
great
doppelbock
worth
the
price
it
is
one
of
the
better
ones
out
of
bavaria
though
not
on
the
highest
tier
12
ounce

for

at
beverage
warehouse
in
marina
del
rey
my
friend
just
got
done
telling
how
good
this
was
when
he
was
over
in
munich
poured
into
my
aventinus
weizen
glass
color
is
a
medium
to
dark
brown
34
inch
creamy
beige
head
aroma
consists
of
roasted
malts
wheat
prunes
plums
caramel
milk
chocolate
roasted
malts
almonds
and
some
spices
flavor
starts
off
with
chocolate
various
spices
in
the
middle
with
a
hint
of
clove
and
nutmeg
carrying
over
into
the
finish
where
sweet
malts
were
prominet
roasted
malts
come
out
in
the
next
few
sips
by
the
end
you
get
a
hint
of
booze
to
go
along
with
dark
fruits
but
there
is
still
lots
of
malts
sweet
slightly
fruity
and
malty
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
actually
pretty
thin
too
much
carbonation
probably
taste
lingers
drinks
pretty
well
but
once
it
warms
it
loses
a
lot
of
its
drinkability
can
get
sweet
and
filling
after
a
while
a
twelve
ounce
serving
was
enough
for
me
had
not
heard
of
this
brewery
before
decent
beer
but
i
do
not
know
about
the
six
pack
being
over
twenty
dollars
even
considering
the
importing
costs
and
other
factors
besides
that
i
would
drink
again
worth
trying
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
would
likely
go
well
with
many
different
foods
especially
spicy
grilled
or
bbq
could
also
pair
with
many
desserts
although
you
likely
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
because
of
its
sweet
character
had
this
as
a
dessert
beer
at
tap
and
table
in
emmaus
pa
for
5
a
bottle
this
is
a
sweet
and
simple
beer
and
i
was
happy
to
end
the
night
with
it
i
dont
mean
to
say
the
beer
was
cloying
it
certainly
had
a
dry
edge
to
it
but
the
flavors
were
big
and
tasty
cocoa
and
fruit
notes
that
included
red
grape
apple
and
sweet
cherries
the
semisweet
chocolate
flavor
led
things
off
but
the
aftertaste
trailed
off
too
quickly
overall
the
beer
drank
well
but
the
flavor
and
feel
were
just
too
thin
for
this
to
be
a
great
beer
worth
a
try
though
caramel
colored
with
a
nice
creamy
head
sweet
malt
aromas
with
caramel
and
a
hint
of
nut
fantastic
flavor
deep
layers
of
caramel
but
not
syrupy
just
enough
hops
to
make
this
a
nice
balanced
doppel
clean
finish
a
bit
thin
on
the
body
but
overall
a
terrific
beer
d
i
like
this
beer
i
feel
that
it
goes
good
with
a
rich
meal
like
steak
or
after
a
meal
it
is
definitely
not
a
fast
drinking
beer
as
it
is
a
little
on
the
heavier
side
mfd
good
bubbles
and
a
weight
to
the
body
that
makes
its
a
good
solid
drink
dark
chestnut
color
poured
into
a
pilsener
glass
little
head
to
be
found
but
it
still
looks
like
a
good
beer
it
smells
quite
malty
a
hint
of
chocolate
smells
decent
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
weird
and
i
cant
quite
say
why
flavor
is
good
and
malty
a
little
hint
of
maple
syrup
this
was
a
decent
enough
dopplebock
but
i
probably
wont
revisit
this
again
poured
into
my
dimpled
mug
this
doppel
appears
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
good
two
fingers
of
light
tan
foam
a
big
dose
of
sweet
caramelized
malt
dominates
the
aroma
and
flavor
followed
by
notes
of
bitter
hops
milk
chocolate
raisins
a
touch
of
molasses
dark
bread
medium
toasted
grains
bordering
on
full
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
very
nice
a
strong
and
fairly
tasty
brew
definitely
one
to
try
d
this
is
pretty
enjoyable
if
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
lowersmoother
this
would
really
pump
it
up
in
my
view
not
the
boldest
biggest
or
most
flavorful
doppelbock
but
definitely
one
of
the
most
drinkable
i
like
how
augustiner
doesnt
follow
the
typical
path
it
might
not
always
be
the
absolute
best
although
it
often
is
but
its
different
the
taste
is
good
but
not
up
to
the
aroma
it
has
a
lot
of
vague
caremlised
stewed
fruit
with
wine
a
hint
of
pepper
with
a
light
bite
and
a
little
creamy
rich
milk
chocolate
its
tasy
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
as
complex
or
rich
as
some
others
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
do
wish
the
malts
had
presented
a
bit
more
intensely
on
the
taste
but
overall
a
very
good
dopplebock
i
do
keep
my
eyes
open
for
it
cause
it
is
quite
good
this
is
a
good
mainstay
doppelbock
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary
but
very
reliable
drinkablility
a
beautiful
beer
that
can
be
savored
and
sipped
i
wouldnt
overdo
it
with
this
onehowever
it
does
go
down
fast
due
to
the
nature
of
the
mouthfeel
and
effect
on
the
salivatory
glands
medium
to
full
bodied
beer
that
i
would
definitely
grab
up
if
i
saw
it
in
a
store
savor
during
a
cool
night
on
the
dock
back
porch
or
while
waiting
for
something
a
delicious
doppelbock
overall
i
found
this
doppelbock
extremely
drinkable
for
the
style
no
overly
cloying
flavors
in
fact
fairly
reserved
for
the
style
but
not
in
a
watereddown
way
no
off
flavors
and
even
at
7
5
you
didnt
notice
the
alcohol
this
pint
went
down
much
faster
than
others
of
the
style
no
super
heavy
flavors
that
force
you
to
take
small
sips
because
of
the
drinkability
factor
a
great
gateway
for
an
introduction
to
the
style
did
not
finish
particularly
well
as
it
was
not
very
fullbodied
or
smooth
and
finished
with
a
bit
of
an
awkward
tingle
on
the
tongue
very
impressed
by
this
one
i
didnt
know
if
it
was
wise
to
spend
13
on
a
beer
i
hadnt
tried
before
but
this
time
it
was
worth
it
pours
a
deep
mahogany
ruby
tinged
tone
with
a
large
tan
head
that
seems
to
be
rather
resilient
during
my
session
with
the
12
oz
portion
lacing
is
thin
and
sparse
but
nonetheless
an
appetizing
brew
for
sure
aromatics
contain
big
ripe
layers
of
raisin
green
apples
and
plums
with
a
touch
of
sour
acidic
wild
brew
action
and
maybe
a
smidget
of
cocoa
powder
flavor
is
toothache
sweet
almost
like
liquified
green
apples
and
raisins
sits
a
bit
heavy
on
the
tartness
and
sweetness
together
the
strange
tartness
and
unique
yeast
flavors
dont
really
work
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
fuller
bodied
and
is
basically
a
meal
compared
to
most
lagers
out
there
sweet
throughout
the
session
does
weigh
in
a
bit
cloying
with
absolutely
no
balancing
act
going
down
carbonation
is
pretty
mellow
but
overall
its
tough
to
stomach
overall
drinkability
is
weak
but
its
a
less
alcholic
version
than
salvator
or
celebrator
both
of
those
kick
this
versions
ass
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
caramel
dark
fruit
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
the
appearance
is
deep
amber
with
a
small
head
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
definite
cardboard
taste
and
medicine
both
of
which
ruin
it
the
palate
is
super
smooth
overall
it
suffers
from
side
effects
that
just
kill
a
great
smelling
beer
d
at
the
price
it
might
be
a
deterring
challenge
but
if
you
enjoy
a
more
winterholiday
beer
style
and
cant
find
it
offseason
this
would
be
a
great
choice
not
the
things
weve
become
accustomed
to
here
in
the
us
but
a
very
solid
version
and
typical
of
a
german
dopplebock
a
clean
refreshing
break
from
heavier
american
craft
brews
the
finish
is
soft
and
leaves
a
caramel
note
grape
and
raisins
that
linger
on
my
tongue
a
solid
bock
but
a
little
waeker
than
i
had
pictured
not
very
fresh
but
glad
i
got
to
try
it
anyway
i
was
surprised
to
even
find
this
thinking
that
i
would
never
get
to
try
an
augustiner
brew
until
i
someday
actually
made
it
to
germany
mfd
smooth
creamy
and
extremely
drinkable
for
a
7
5
abv
if
you
are
a
doppelbock
fan
and
i
am
you
have
to
check
this
one
out
its
one
of
the
best
out
there
d
on
the
whole
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
though
its
probably
not
something
id
seek
out
again
overall
a
really
nice
doppelbock
i
wish
i
had
bought
a
few
more
the
taste
is
pretty
commenserate
with
the
aroma
lots
of
brown
sugar
sweetness
lots
of
caramel
sweet
malts
molasses
some
alcohol
soaked
heavy
fruit
presence
there
is
a
raisiny
and
sweet
pineapple
flavor
to
the
beer
mostly
raisin
though
the
beer
has
a
definite
syrupy
liqueur
mouthfeel
a
warming
alcohol
presence
throughout
the
beer
is
cloyingly
sweet
low
carbonation
and
very
typical
for
the
style
the
alcohol
is
kept
in
check
and
there
is
not
the
difficult
throaty
burn
so
characteristic
of
the
style
this
is
a
sipping
beer
for
those
like
me
who
are
only
okay
with
this
style
and
not
really
big
fans
d
good
drinkability
notes
from
4705
dark
amber
doublebock
with
a
hazel
head
that
quickly
disappears
aroma
is
dark
and
rich
like
that
of
raisins
it
has
a
sweet
syruplike
character
that
extends
into
the
flavor
profile
malts
are
rich
taste
honeyroasted
and
lingers
on
the
finish
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
but
the
sweetness
may
limit
the
numbers
you
can
down
in
one
sitting
d
nice
doppel
18
a
sixer
though
so
id
only
buy
it
as
a
single
good
beer
overall
d
extremely
high
most
doppelbocks
are
sweet
enough
to
wear
out
their
welcome
but
i
drank
three
of
these
in
a
sitting
in
hindsight
not
the
best
idea
poured
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
stuck
around
smelled
of
cinnamon
spices
and
malts
tasted
sweet
and
caramel
malts
a
smooth
spice
going
on
in
there
and
maybe
some
bread
texture
this
beer
was
incredibly
smooth
almost
like
a
cola
at
times
with
the
close
to
creamy
mouthfeel
i
wanted
more
it
went
down
easy
perilously
drinkable
considering
its
strength
full
of
flavor
yet
rather
light
of
body
with
an
appealing
fruitiness
and
soft
carbonation
a
very
tasty
version
of
the
style
which
i
would
happily
drink
again
d
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
take
on
the
doppelbock
a
dark
malt
bomb
with
manageable
alcohol
content
worth
trying
md
heavy
as
expected
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
hung
around
as
expected
from
this
style
not
a
hot
summer
days
beer
but
certainally
a
nice
one
to
finish
the
night
off
with
this
came
close
to
a
5
on
taste
ranks
up
there
with
celebrator
my
favortite
of
all
beers
but
not
quite
there
drinks
great
dont
remember
coming
across
this
in
germany
super
solid
dopplebock
overall
not
the
best
doppelbock
ive
tried
but
certainly
a
good
reminder
of
why
i
love
the
style
so
much
wonderfully
delicious
traditional
yet
unique
one
i
will
keep
in
mind
when
in
the
mood
for
a
malty
doppelbock
nice
maltiness
here
worth
a
shot
extremely
malty
with
hints
of
juicy
caramel
prunes
milk
chocolate
cocoa
and
walnuts
i
like
the
balance
of
heavy
malts
and
a
strong
nutty
punch
a
solid
doppelbock
overall
and
quite
enjoyable
pours
a
four
finger
light
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
traces
of
lace
clear
mahogany
color
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
slight
malty
nose
flavor
is
nutty
caramel
easy
to
drink
2
85
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
the
taste
was
very
caramel
heavy
not
an
overwhelming
intense
taste
but
the
caramel
malts
seemed
to
dominate
the
palate
a
bit
raisony
as
well
good
drinkable
beer
here
medium
bodied
and
quite
tasty
put
this
on
your
dobblebock
list
i
ran
a
germanfest
last
weekend
and
this
was
a
hit
of
the
party
was
and
always
will
be
a
favorite
crisp
initially
with
a
smooth
buttery
feel
and
some
slight
warmth
in
the
end
semidry
with
a
lingering
waxy
malt
feel
on
the
tongue
got
this
one
from
a
friend
who
didnt
really
know
what
he
was
drinking
but
he
made
a
good
choice
nonetheless
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
some
copper
highlights
a
good
finger
of
head
that
dissolves
fairly
quickly
and
doesnt
really
leave
much
lacing
nose
is
lots
of
spicy
toffee
malt
dried
fruit
in
there
as
well
some
caramel
and
a
touch
of
hops
taste
is
similar
strong
on
those
fruit
notes
and
then
a
nice
dose
of
sweet
hops
a
touch
of
chocolate
in
there
as
well
feel
is
good
appropriate
for
the
style
with
good
carbonation
overall
quite
a
tasty
doppelbock
damn
easy
to
drink
but
the
potency
is
noticeable
the
alcohol
provides
a
little
heat
this
is
a
topnotch
doppelbock
while
not
as
complex
as
some
there
is
still
plenty
going
on
it
might
be
too
sweet
for
some
people
but
if
nothing
else
this
would
be
a
great
sipping
beer
after
a
good
meal
for
10
99
a
sixpack
it
is
worth
the
cost
recommended
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
beer
is
a
meal
in
itself
i
can
truthfully
attest
to
this
it
fills
the
stomach
and
fulfills
hunger
i
recently
came
off
of
a
fast
where
all
i
drank
was
this
beer
i
went
5
days
this
beer
sustained
me
it
truly
is
a
square
meal
in
a
bottle
very
filling
and
its
got
enough
nutrition
to
keep
you
going
well
that
is
perhaps
if
you
arent
doing
stressful
or
any
kind
of
physical
activity
or
laborreason
for
the
fast
ending
anyway
this
is
a
brew
that
id
buy
and
drink
again
though
i
love
exploring
this
style
so
im
sure
it
might
be
a
bit
till
i
come
back
to
it
i
could
drink
a
bunch
if
on
draught
somewhere
but
there
are
better
brews
out
there
a
lot
of
this
is
personal
opinion
but
this
brew
is
just
all
right
gets
a
lot
better
as
i
drink
and
my
palate
warms
up
to
the
sweet
if
you
like
doppelbocks
then
send
me
a
beer
mail
telling
me
what
it
tastes
like
to
you
as
i
would
like
to
expand
my
palate
to
the
various
lagers
out
there
as
im
more
of
an
ale
guy
the
flavor
is
rich
very
malty
with
a
tinge
of
caramel
and
hops
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
the
finish
is
not
subtle
at
all
this
beer
is
a
little
bit
on
the
english
ale
side
of
things
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
alcohol
warming
finish
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
but
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
this
is
not
my
favorite
taste
not
to
say
that
it
is
not
a
good
beer
for
the
type
pours
a
meduim
brown
with
a
one
finger
beige
head
that
fades
quickly
with
some
spotty
lace
nice
fruity
floral
aromas
in
the
nose
sweet
taste
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
with
lots
of
toasted
malt
with
other
subtle
flavors
smooth
and
well
balanced
mouthfeel
light
and
carbonation
is
a
little
light
also
greast
taste
very
enjoyable
augustiner
brau
maximator
is
an
easy
drinking
bavarian
doppelbock
that
reminds
me
of
what
i
like
most
about
strong
german
lagers
the
maximator
is
not
an
overly
big
doppelbock
at
7
5
abv
but
big
enough
to
pack
a
punch
while
still
keeping
the
alcohol
well
in
the
background
rich
malty
and
toasted
flavors
dominate
both
the
aroma
and
taste
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bitterness
and
alcohol
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
overall
a
very
drinkable
clean
clear
german
lager
that
is
a
frequent
resident
in
my
fridge
during
the
winter
months
d
since
its
mild
its
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
good
on
that
front
but
of
course
youll
want
to
watch
for
that
alcohol
sneaking
up
on
you
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
a
medium
thin
and
foamy
beige
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
small
patches
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
roasted
malt
and
caramel
along
with
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
mediumbodied
with
rich
peaty
malt
flavor
coupled
with
plum
and
raisin
plus
softer
hops
an
interesting
mix
overall
the
finish
is
sweet
caramel
malt
with
earthy
undertones
and
a
lightly
spiced
hops
aftertaste
pretty
enjoyable
from
start
to
finish
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
oddit
seems
thin
and
full
at
the
same
time
the
carbonation
also
attacked
the
mouth
at
first
but
it
might
have
been
due
in
part
to
not
letting
the
beer
warm
quite
enough
before
opening
drinkability
is
good
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
sugary
malty
beer
i
tend
to
prefer
hoppier
brews
but
this
is
good
nonetheless
pretty
good
doppelbock
overall
it
was
severely
lacking
in
carbonation
but
otherwise
pretty
nice
very
much
a
malt
lovers
beer
though
as
it
is
one
of
the
sweeter
doppelbocks
ive
had
bordering
on
being
cloying
and
syrupy
somewhat
middle
of
the
road
but
nice
if
you

the
good

days
about
14
years
ago
when
i
couldnt
finish
a
german
doppelbock
dozens
and
dozens
of
imperial
stouts
and
imperial
ipas
later
this
is
a
pleasant
milder
but
no
less
juicy
and
dense
enjoyment
i
havent
been
to
germany
in
8
years
its
getting
high
time
for
a
return
to
the
source
of
my
initial
quest
for
better
beer
as
the
beer
warms
up
im
catching
a
tiny
bit
of
maple
syrup
on
the
aroma
palate
and
finish
as
the
brewer
monk
on
the
label
gazes
admirably
into
the
distance
i
gaze
admirably
at
him
it
looks
like
he
has
a
smirk
about
something
probably
the
fact
that
after
ten
years
i
have
sold
out
but
after
679
years
augustiner
has
not
dark

a

that
goes

leaves
little

is
fruit
fig
and
raisin
etc
sugars
some
bready
yeast
and
some
malt
not
quite
as
caramelly
and
choco
toffee
as
i
would
have
thought
theres
alittle
bit
of
a
sour
kick
to
the
taste
just
a
little
little
hops
are
in
there
and
some
flavors
ive
only
experienced
in
belgian
beer
mainly
that
yeast
character
and
the
fruit
taste
i
kind
of
like
it
actually
i
like
it
but
im
not
sure
if
its
proper
for
the
style
nice
slick
medium
body
and
a
cool
drink
to
me
i
have
weird
tastes
though
i
dont
even
know
what
to
make
of
this
one
i
know
i
really
like
it
but
it
would
be
hard
to
recommend
i
think
ill
have
a
couple
more
i
believe
this
is
a
must
try
drinkability
while
its
apr
is
high
7
5
it
doesnt
feel
like
a
strong
beer
at
first
but
after
a
couple
it
really
hits
you
great
beer
but
it
will
get
you
very
drunk
if
you
dont
watch
yourself
beer
ours
a
nice
thick
ruby
brown
with
a
big
creamy
head
that
apparently
has
somewhere
to
go
because
it
doesnt
stick
around
long
it
looks
thinner
than
an
olsen
twin
after
the
head
heads
west
smells
like
it
might
be
a
nice
date
all
of
the
makings
of
a
great
dopple
unfortunately
this
beer
like
many
hot
22
yr
olds
lacks
substance
it
falls
a
little
flat
and
isnt
nearly
as
interesting
up
close
as
it
is
from
a
distance
it
finishes
a
bit
tart
with
a
mouthfeel
that
showcases
a
complete
lack
of
suitable
carbonation
and
a
peanut
taste
that
could
use
some
smuckers
oh
well
the
bottle
is
kind
of
cool
which
is
why
most
people
must
buy
this
clear
brown
pour
with
a
light
tan
head
which
lasts
for
a
couple
of
minutes
little
or
no
lacing
malt
sugar
and
some
hop
in
the
aroma
sweet
malt
is
the
first
thing
to
hit
the
tongue
followed
by
a
little
hop
bitterness
pleasant
but
not
very
complex
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
the
style
i
usually
like
this
style
a
lot
but
this
is
one
that
i
will
pass
on
in
the
future
not
bad
just
not
all
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
its
no
celebrator
but
its
still
a
good
doppelbock
thick
brew
not
bad
carbonation
is
decent
and
mouthfeel
is
okay
if
a
little
slick
a
little
flavorless
a
cross
somewhere
between
schwarzbier
and
doppelbock
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
an
almost
syrupy
texure
and
relatively
low
carbonation
the
drinkabilty
for
me
is
only
inhinited
by
the
alcohol
content
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
and
it
tastes
good
enough
to
do
just
that
would
get
me
in
all
kinds
of
trouble
drinkabililty
well
lets
get
one
thing
straight
a
sixer
of
this
beer
aint
cheap
i
paid
12
for
a
sixer
but
its
worth
every
penny
i
had
two
fresh
bottles
of
this
beer
and
its
a
great
beer
to
relax
with
respect
it
though
since
it
is
a
strong
beer
a
wonderful
beer
brewed
by
a
wellrespected
and
fairly
unknown
to
most
americans
anyway
munich
brewer
trust
me
this
is
a
gem
of
a
doppelbock
not
the
ideal
beer
for
a
hot
day
but
as
i
enjoyed
it
so
much
on
a
warm
day
i
can
only
imagine
what
it
must
do
to
take
the
bitter
chill
out
of
say
a
cold
march
evening
d
overall
a
pretty
interestingly
balanced
beer
one
that
offers
much
taste
up
front
and
eases
into
a
relaxing
finish
pours
a
dark
but
clear
redbrown
with
a
thick
head
of
creamy
tan
bubbles
aroma
is
of
sweet
dark
fruits
plumbs
with
just
a
hint
of
some
earthy
hops
taste
is
a
bit
syrupy
but
not
off
putting
a
bit
of
bread
as
well
about
what
i
would
expect
from
a
doppelbock
except
maybe
a
bit
thin
in
the
aftertaste
at
first
i
thought
it
was
the
hops
making
a
comeback
but
the
more
i
drink
it
seems
more
of
an
astringency
from
the
grains
not
terrible
but
not
great
either
soso
better
doppelbocks
have
been
made
since
1328
drinkability
a
very
nice
doppelbock
very
fruity
and
not
overly
sweet
cellars
nicely
too
this
is
my
favorite
doppelbock
due
to
the
dark
fruit
element
and
exceptional
balance
cheers
from
a
12
ozer
this
produced
a
nice
falling
pour
seemlingly
still
at
first
but
slowly
and
surely
creating
a
nice
carbonated
rise
into
a
firm
but
very
thin
head
of
foam
the
body
is
deep
crimson
with
a
steady
amount
of
carbonation
continuing
to
boil
the
aroma
accosts
my
nasal
passages
with
an
alcoholic
sting
and
an
almost
cherryjuice
aspect
at
the
first
sip
that
hint
of
cherry
rears
its
head
again
although
subtle
and
restrained
like
a
mildly
flavored
cough
drop
that
sliver
of
the
flavor
settles
into
the
background
as
i
go
and
this
mellows
into
a
very
drinkable
and
smooth
caramelladen
warming
brew
all
the
way
nice

overall
a
very
good
brew
very
good
and
terribly
drinkable
if
in
munich
stop
in
and
grab
one
if
you
have
the
time
if
you
have
a
choice
though
spring
for
andechser
instead
their
doppelbock
is
superior
overall
quite
enjoyable
beer
poured
into
tumbler
at
45
degrees
beer
was
very
dark
with
a
dark
head
that
fell
rather
rapidly
smell
was
average
nutty
raosted
smell
no
lacing
to
mention
taste
was
okay
not
too
strong
and
with
kind
of
a
fruitty
nutty
malty
taste
it
was
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
tasted
slighly
sour
to
me
enough
so
i
will
have
to
decline
aother
purchase
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
very
good
dopplebock
id
expect
more
malt
flavors
a
bit
more
sweetness
and
a
thicker
heavier
mouthfeel
its
worth
a
shot
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
raisins
carmelized
malt
rum
soaked
sweet
dark
bread
baked
apples
and
some
mild
roast
bitterness
in
the
finish
has
a
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
this
is
quite
good
and
im
happy
i
got
more
than
just
one
bottle
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
on
this
cold
winter
night
cheers
great
drinkability
this
is
a
db
that
could
just
be
sessionable
drinkability
nicely
drinkable
albeit
a
slow
sipper
this
is
a
nice
full
bodied
beer
that
satisfies
the
hunger
for
a
hearty
brew
try
it
poured
from
a
bottle
with
no
apparent
freshness
date
deep
brown
color
with
redish
hints
wheaty
yet
beautiful
aroma
the
taste
a
sweet
malty
flavor
with
nutty
finish
it
feels
loose
in
the
mouth
and
leaves
a
soda
like
finish
highly
drinkable
i
could
sit
on
the
couch
all
night
watcing
the
mets
drinking
mug
after
mug
of
this
brew
oelergud
this
is
a
very
passive
doppelbock
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
its
creamy
and
its
not
too
sweet
all
of
these
characteristics
come
together
to
allow
the
fruitiness
to
shine
through
and
make
for
a
very
drinkable
doppelbock
poured
a
deep
reddishbrown
color
with
modest
white
head
that
very
quickly
disappeared
smell
is
slightly
malty
with
much
dark
fruit
plums
figs
also
to
be
found
taste
is
extremely
enjoyable
with
a
nice
full
malty
taste
and
lots
of
dark
fruit
tastes
finishes
with
a
nice
fruity
sweetnes
unbelieveably
drinkable
for
a
7
5
beer
great
job
d
an
easy
drinker
considering
the
7
5
abv
wonderful
smoothness
as
is
characteristic
of
all
german
lagers
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
couldnt
even
really
embelish
my
review
this
is
a
standard
db
not
one
of
the
greats
12
oz
bottle
that
overflowed
with
foam
when
i
popped
the
cap
it
pours
a
deep
hazed
redplum
that
is
topped
with
a
small
tan
head
lots
of
rich
sweet
malts
in
the
nose
toasted
caramel
molasses
and
darktart
fruits
with
the
flavor
mimicking
closely
but
with
the
addition
of
light
hops
and
bitterness
also
there
is
faint
coffee
and
chocolate
on
top
of
a
medium
body
that
becomes
near
flat
by
the
end
an
average
german
dopple
that
is
quite
malty
and
can
be
a
bit
hard
to
describe
good
but
probably
wont
come
back
to
it
mouthfeel
contains
little
bits
of
syrupy
malt
but
its
a
tad
thin
along
the
palate
overall
not
bad
considering
we
dont
know
the
age
of
it
this
was
bought
at
michaels
deli
in
kop
another
bonified
db
pours
to
the
brown
side
of
red
white
a
overexcited
white
head
smell
is
deafening
if
that
makes
sense
it
is
malt
malt
nothing
but
munich
malt
long
boil
sugar
goodness
but
not
really
sweet
the
crushing
malt
smell
translates
well
into
the
palate
but
there
is
a
nice
ongoing
balance
with
the
hops
adding
a
earthy
prespective
with
the
alcohol
just
making
a
quick
apperance
chewy
and
inviting
this
is
one
for
enjoying
anytime
what
can
i
say
this
is
a
very
good
doppelbock
and
has
the
typical
doppelbock
flavor
pours
a
dark
brown
and
looks
a
bit
like
rootbeer
had
a
thick
head
that
disapated
after
a
minute
or
so
id
say
that
this
is
my
3rd
favorite
doppelbock
falling
behind
celebrator
and
weihenstephaners
korbinian
it
loses
a
bit
because
of
its
relatively
low
alcohol
content
thats
a
small
quibble
though
if
you
find
this
then
you
must
try
this
d
high
easy
to
pound
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
literally
exploded
when
i
opened
the
bottle
2
bottles
in
a
row
once
it
was
poured
it
looked
really
good
dark
reddish
brown
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
foam
it
smelled
malty
and
sweet
and
sugars
dominated
the
flavor
too
a
really
good
doppelbock
ill
make
a
point
of
getting
it
again
drinkability
the
flavor
is
exquisite
but
the
alcohol
is
surely
palpable
mildly
filling
but
a
great
experience
fine
beer
drinkability
is
very
high
it
is
hard
to
stop
12oz
is
just
not
enough
how
about
12l
this
is
your
fathers
fathers
fathers
fathers
fathers
fathers
fathers
and
so
on
dopplebach
mk
mt
light
fluffy
delicious
drinkability
takes
a
hit
for
the
sweetness
i
liked
the
first
couple
sips
but
after
that
it
got
to
be
a
bit
too
much
poured
a
lovely
rubyblack
with
red
hues
at
the
bottom
of
my
goblet
a
soft
cream
colored
head
developed
and
stayed
for
just
a
few
moments
little
carbonation
was
detected
aromas
of
mocha
alcohol
salt
cream
and
dried
fruit
the
taste
was
dominated
by
malt
but
there
were
plenty
of
fruity
flavors
a
subtle
cream
flavor
was
detectable
in
the
finish
adding
an
additional
layer
of
smoothness
easy
to
drink
easy
to
enjoy
this
was
a
flavorful
and
exciting
doppelbock
very
satisfying
high
high
praise
for
this
wonderfully
satisfying
doppelbock
i
must
say
this
is
a
very
good
dopplebock
nice
coffe
caramel
undertones
beautiful

on
the
pour
very
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
with
some
wicked
hops
kickback
at
the
end
smells
of
cocoa
and
caramel
with
the
alcohol
being
present
warms
ya
up
too
i
really
enjoyed
and
recommend
this
one
exploded
upon
opening
forcing
the
frantic
shove
the
bottle
in
your
mouth
and
drink
foam
until
it
subsides
move
eventually
the
pour
was
headless
and
dark
mahogany
nose
includes
caramel
and
dark
fruits
taste
starts
with
the
vinuous
dark
fruit
transitioning
into
bready
sweet
caramel
malt
and
warming
alcohol
mouthfeel
was
typically
rich
for
a
doppelbock
overall
a
decent
authentic
tasting
doppebock
but
i
cant
help
but
prefer
a
local
capital
blonde
dopplebock
or
autumnal
fire
anyday
mouth
feel
is
full
bodied
and
a
bit
under
carbonated
d
almost
exceptional
slightly
bitter
and
mildly
sour
aftertaste
and
a
moderately
big
mouthfeel
for
a
lager
overall
not
bad
but
definitely
not
my
favourite
doppelbock
drinkability
really
good
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
extended
drinking
one
bottle
was
enough
for
me
mouthfeel
a
sweet
palate
overall
witha
lager
like
drinkability
except
one
with
more
alcohol
than
most
lagers
this
beer
pours
a
silky
dark
brown
and
leaves
a
sticky
beige
head
that
lingers
in
the
glass
as
i
smell
this
beer
i
can
really
get
the
caramal
a
faint
alcohol
smell
as
well
as
the
chocolate
and
a
dark
fruit
essence
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
def
bitter
chocolate
malty
presence
and
a
finish
of
hops
and
alcohal
i
can
also
feel
a
sense
of
warmth
as
this
beer
flows
down
the
throat
this
is
a
decent
brew
that
has
a
great
finish
and
is
pretty
balanced
although
could
be
better
for
the
style
and
price
while
fitting
the
moniker
of
the
beer
being
liquid
bread
i
could
see
myself
as
a
monk
for
a
month
and
a
half
during
lent
if
they
fasted
giving
up
food
for
this
fortifying
elixor
good
things
come
to
those
who
wait
after
pouring
looking
at
and
smelling
maximator
i
was
less
than
impressed
it
won
me
over
though
in
the
end
i
consider
it
to
be
one
of
the
better
doppelbocks
that
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
drink
12
ounce
bottle
this
beer
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
a
very
potent
combination
of
dough
and
prunes
huge
malt
flavor
that
is
quite
sweet
other
flavors
include
dough
and
caramel
there
is
a
little
bitter
flavor
in
the
finish
but
overall
this
is
very
sweet
mouthfeel
is
creamy
low
carbonation
a
good
choice
if
you
like
malty
beers
prost
beertracker
drinkability
overall
a
good
typical
german
dopplebock
that
is
easily
found
and
affordable
if
you
like
dopplebocks
then
you
need
to
try
this
one
licorice
and
anise
and
grassy
aroma
very
dark
brown
carmel
cocacola
and
well
carbonated
large
but
dissapearing
head
lace
sourness
like
a
baltic
cocoa
powder
in
medium
mouthfeel
mixed
up
well
with
different
other
tastes
more
of
a
cooking
beer
by
itself
this
is
a
softer
and
less
confrontational
doppelbock
but
what
it
lacks
in
bravado
it
makes
up
for
in
supple
drinkability
an
exceptionally
welldone
and
superbly
drinkable
soft
and
verywell
rounded
doppelbock
it
has
a
moderately
full
and
creamy
mouthfeel
some
fizz
and
decent
body
a
nice
doppelbock
not
too
deep
or
profound
drinkable
yes
not
my
instant
favorite
but
i
will
try
it
again
this
has
great
potential
as
a
dessert
beer
or
as
a
way
to
introduce
new
beer
advocates
to
better
styles
it
got
me
on
the
road
to
better
beer
because
it
was
very
approachable
without
a
great
deal
of
hop
bitterness
that
might
have
turned
me
off
at
that
point
but
now
even
having
tried
and
enjoyed
hoppier
beers
i
must
say
that
this
one
still
impresses
me
this
beer
is
the
color
of
pepsi
there
is
a
tiny
glaze
of
a
head
and
a
ring
around
the
edge
that
just
cant
quite
form
lacing
there
is
a
strong
smell
of
sweet
yeasty
bread
dough
there
is
also
a
wine
like
scent
with
a
hint
of
prunes
or
rasins
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smells
above
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
and
appealing
drinkability
is
good
from
notes
this
beer
poured
a
ambered
brown
color
with
a
small
ring
of
head
over
top
the
nose
was
fig
with
a
slight
nutty
and
bready
quality
the
flavor
was
big
with
a
nice
fig
and
bready
the
feel
was
moderate
with
a
nice
active
carbonation
overall
the
beer
was
well
balanced
i
liked
the
flavor
and
and
feel
id
try
it
again
pours
into
the
glass
with
a
decent
light
tan
head
over
very
lightly
hazy
dark
maroon
liquid
tinged
with
brown
sweet
malty
nose
with
some
chocolate
and
slight
raisin
aromas
very
good
smelling
soft
and
smooth
malty
mouthfeel
with
great
sweet
maltiness
with
light
underlying
roastiness
and
sufficient
hop
bitterness
some
alcohol
felt
in
the
back
of
the
throat
after
swallowing
finishes
nicely
bittersweet
with
a
malt
and
alcohol
kick
very
tasty
and
drinkable
havent
seen
this
around
my
area
in
at
least
17
years
welcome
back
i
say
12
ouncer
sampled
no
freshness
indicater
to
be
found
for
guidance
but
hey
these
guys
should
know
what
they
are
doing
since
1328
clearly
noted
on
the
label
sweet
maltynose
this
is
a
strong
bold
flavorful
german
classic
lots
of
chocolate
alcohol
and
malty
sweetness
fine
brew
for
a
nightcapper
exceptional
beer
i
bought
it
expecting
their
light
lager
what
a
very
pleasant
surprise
i
will
go
get
more
tomorrow
pours
a
tawny
brown
color
with
a
huge
tan
head
aromas
of
rumraisin
pumpernickel
bread
brandy
slight
cardboardiness
and
light
hopping
the
taste
envelops
a
plumminess
that
accompanies
the
dark
roasted
malts
very
well
hopping
is
fairly
low
aside
from
a
faint
vegetal
astringency
in
the
finish
slight
notes
of
chocolate
and
miniscule
nuances
of
anise
a
little
sweet
but
not
outlandishly
so
its
balanced
very
well
a
very
nice
doppelbock
thats
recommended
a
very
nice
well
made
doppelbock
probably
moves
into
my
top

enjoyed
at
the
brickskeller
in
dc
pours
a
rubybrown
with
a
nice
head
and
orangish
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
malty
taste
is
quite
rich
malty
pleasantly
sweet
with
hints
of
dried
fruitsraisins
maybe
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
and
a
roasty
bitter
finish
i
would
say
that
this
would
be
an
excellent
everyday
doppelbock
since
it
has
a
little
of
everything
just
a
very
well
made
solid
beer
the
malty
richness
may
limit
the
number
of
these
you
could
drink
in
one
sitting
but
im
a
malt
head
so
i
still
give
it
high
marks
for
drinkability
deep
ruby
brown
body
wears
minimal
head
but
displays
a
nice
little
haze
its
aroma
is
rich
and
bold
claiming
for
the
big
leagues
in
the
doppelbock
community
moderately
complex
flavor
suburb
ranges
from
the
floral
almond
skin
to
the
woody
and
almost
cheesy
sweet
fruits
you
bite
into
that
honeymelon
only
to
uncover
a
grape
branch
and
vinous
berries
upon
tasting
i
once
again
am
taken
aback
by
more
unexpected
character
showing
up
in
the
form
of
a
earthy
and
roasty
bitter
finish
though
i
pass
through
the
fruit
and
nut
appetizer
at
first
soft
carbonation
accompanies
the
medium
body
the
global
experience
remains
constructive
more
warming
toward
the
end
but
as
interesting
in
its
unveiling
mysteries
form
the
beginning
interestingly
multilayered
in
its
boldness
drinkability
too
heavy
for
many
in
a
row
but
tasty
and
well
made
enough
to
have
again
certainly
overall
not
doing
a
whole
lot
to
recommend
itself
to
me
maybe
im
spoiled
because
im
currently
working
my
way
through
a
case
of
celebrator
but
as
a
doppelbock
this
brew
was
somewhat
disappointing
for
me
the
taste
is
pretty
average
and
it
doesnt
look
or
smell
particularly
great
theres
so
many
great
alternatives
in
the
style
that
i
can
never
see
myself
wanting
this
one
again
full
bodied
with
easy
carbonation
rich
and
silky
smooth
in
the
mouth
very
good
taste
and
body
highly
enjoyable
not
too
satisfactory
all
told
this
seems
like
a
realized
bock
its
a
bit
thinnish
in
structure
and
a
bit
tame
in
overall
flavor
to
be
hailed
as
a
dopplebock
but
as
such
it
is
tremendously
drinkable
and
enjoyable
just
the
same
i
enjoyed
this
beer
with
a
grilled
sirloin
steak
and
mashed
potatoes
what
a
combo
i
was
in
heaven
drinkability
most
doppelbocks
have
a
very
in
your
face
flavor
profile
this
doppel
is
subtle
it
whispers
where
other
doppels
scream
an
outstandingly
welldesigned
beer
theres
a
lot
of
mouthfeel
going
on
in
this
beer
a
rich
syrupy
texture
and
lots
of
carbonation
along
with
the
toffeecaramel
malt
flavors
make
it
a
tasty
brew
zum
wohl
a
fine
doppelbock
with
complex
layers
of
malty
flavors
dominated
by
the
molasses
taste
that
seems
to
be
the
bechmark
of
a
first
class
doppelbock
certainly
this
is
one
i
will
try
again
soon
and
it
would
be
fun
to
taste
this
one
alongside
a
celebrator
or
salvator
pours
a
dark
ruby
colour
with
a
minimal
khaki
head
that
doesnt
last
to
long
smell
is
of
rich
roasted
malts
this
is
gonna
be
a
meal
in
a
glass
taste
echos
the
smell
dark
breads
dried
fruits
a
hint
of
cigar
tobacco
and
more
malt
on
top
enough
hops
to
keep
it
in
line
but
none
to
speak
of
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
i
would
have
thought
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
still
there
this
beer
would
go
great
with
roast
duck
with
some
red
cabbage
yummm
this
beer
and
celebrator
are
the
cream
of
the
dopplebock
crop
to
me
the
aroma
is
of
pungent
malt
and
a
bit
of
caramel
poured
a
dark
coco
colored
head
that
faded
quickly
to
a
film
dark
brown
in
color
with
slight
amber
hue
the
flavor
is
nice
creamy
malt
fresh
caramel
and
some
raisins
creamy
moderately
thick
body
caramel
in
the
finish
fades
slowly
this
reminds
me
of
why
i
like
doppelbocks
clearly
a
doppelbock
although
the
bottle
only
gives
the
cryptic
identification
of
dark
beer
pours
a
ruddy
brown
with
some
sediment
evident
throughout
the
pour
nomimal
head
and
carbonation
was
fairly
reserved
aroma
was
sweet
caramel
and
prune
juice
body
was
substantial
and
a
bit
syrupy
flavor
was
quite
sweet
with
caramel
toffee
molasses
and
dominating
prune
flavors
alchohol
was
noteworthy
in
the
background
with
some
black
pepper
overall
the
beer
was
just
too
heavyhanded
even
for
the
style
although
there
was
nothing
in
particular
about
the
beer
that
was
bad
the
overall
effect
was
that
i
found
myself
trudging
through
it
and
not
enjoying
it
all
that
much
i
suppose
this
one
should
be
chalked
up
to
personal
taste
rather
than
beer
quality
this
was
a
very
nice
doppelbock
it
was
a
dark
rubypurple
colour
with
a
small
and
quickly
dissipating
head
of
white
foam
the
aromas
were
of
coffee
plum
brandy
port
wine
alcohol
deep
roasted
malts
and
slight
german
hops
the
taste
was
of
chocolate
caramel
port
wine
alcohol
malts
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
to
medium
bodied
and
totally
acceptable
for
this
style
of
beer
and
the
drinkability
was
great
for
a
doppelbock
a
deep
purplish
brown
color
this
beer
began
with
lots
of
carbonation
but
showed
little
of
anything
through
the
session
smelled
chocolatey
with
a
big
pocktextured
malt
that
was
grainy
sweet
and
nascently
bready
also
tasted
chocolatey
accompanied
by
a
winey
malt
and
scruffy
wood
notes
and
tart
snaps
almost
syrupy
smooth
this
is
a
complex
beer
though
the
finish
could
be
less
hectic
and
sloppy
warming
immediately
filling
drinkable
and
pretty
cheap
for
an
import
a
good
pick
very
little
head
but
nice
lacing
dark
chocolate
appearance
rich
smell
that
was
sweet
with
a
hint
of
spice
and
some
alcohol
presence
taste
was
sweet
but
rounded
and
full
slight
alcohol
hit
at
the
back
of
the
palate
for
its
abv
very
smooth
and
drinkable
a
definite
winter
style
brew
the
flavor
is
very
full
of
malt
and
pungent
fruitiness
the
feel
is
full
and
tends
towards
a
syrupy
sense
because
of
the
thick
fullness
limited
drinkability
due
to
the
abv
and
heavy
body
feel
the
head
on
this
beer
is
nonexistent
aroma
is
lacking
as
well
in
the
aroma
are
roasted
and
chocolate
notes
but
not
the
expected
raisin
and
malt
the
flavor
is
roasted
and
chocolate
and
then
the
sweetness
fades
into
a
dry
chocolate
finish
it
does
go
down
smooth
and
have
a
good
drinkability
i
like
the
beer
but
cannot
review
it
highly
as
a
dopplebock
on
first
appearance
a
nice
looking
brew
dark
and
rich
looking
with
a
nice
tan
head
and
lace
it
had
sort
of
that
burnt
malt
aroma
but
not
overpowering
a
wonderfully
complex
beer
with
dark
malt
flavors
as
well
as
a
smokelike
taste
easy
to
drink
for
such
a
strong
beer
not
too
filling
either
perfect
for
fall
a
very
restrained
classy
doppelbock
wont
knock
you
on
your
ass
with
any
one
flavor
but
everything
comes
together
nice
plums
chocolate
hops
coffee
and
some
alchohol
burn
at
the
end
very
round
flavor
no
smokiness
and
not
overly
carbonated
i
recommend
this
one
flavor
is
powerfully
malty
with
a
strong
roastiness
a
bit
of
sweet
chocolate
and
molasses
with
hints
of
dates
fig
and
green
raisin
no
apparent
alcohol
viscous
heavy
mouthfeel
with
mild
carbonation
very
smooth
drinking
for
its
strength
flavors
are
powerful
yet
smooth
round
edged
and
subtle
excellent
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
creamy
head
and
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
a
coffeechocolate
hint
to
it
the
flavor
was
very
smooth
very
little
carbonation
and
very
rich
mouthfeel
there
is
also
a
hint
of
fruityness
in
the
flavor
that
is
very
nice
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
do
so
again
pours
amber
brown
head
is
there
during
the
pour
but
is
eliminated
immediately
very
bubbly
brew
in
the
glass
strong
tantalizing
aroma
of
powerful
sugary
malt
and
dark
fruit
particularly
plums
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
i
expected
a
chewier
breadier
doppel
could
use
a
thicker
body
taste
is
wonderful
and
complex
enough
highly
malty
and
balanced
well
with
a
caramel
sweetness
only
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
not
the
best
but
certainly
a
winner
a
very
nice
doppel
but
falls
short
of
the
greats
like
celebrator
big
malts
provide
a
caramel
flavor
without
too
much
sweetness
a
bit
bready
with
a
balanced
bitterness
very
well
hidden
alcohol
i
have
no
idea
how
much
heat
this
beer
is
packing
but
in
the
interest
of
science
i
will
keep
trying
till
i
figure
it
out
this
dopplebock
poured
a
medium
tan
head
that
dissolved
quickly
and
it
contained
finemedium
bubbles
there
was
no
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
body
was
dark
brown
it
had
a
sweet
aroma
to
it
the
taste
was
very
smoooth
and
this
was
a
dopplebock
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
dopplebock
are
sooooo
good
thi
poured
a
deep
velvety
brownishred
color
with
almost
no
head
to
speak
ofthe
smell
was
very
chocolaty
and
coffeelike
the
taste
was
not
as
sweet
as
some
others
of
the
style
but
still
retaines
alot
of
the
traits
of
a
good
doppeli
was
really
impressed
with
that
honestly
had
never
heard
of
if
this
before
i
bought
it
today
this
brew
poured
a
medium
head
of
finely
sized
light
brown
bubbles
and
asemiopaque
dark
brown
body
it
has
a
very
nice
medium
strength
malt
aroma
with
a
very
good
malt
doppelbock
flavor
it
is
very
smooth
from
start
to
finish
slightly
sweet
and
leaves
a
slight
tingling
sensation
in
the
aftertaste
i
found
maximator
to
have
a
profile
similar
to
salvator
but
the
rye
flavors
were
richer
and
the
liquorice
sweetness
was
much
more
noticeable
much
flatter
as
well
very
sweet
and
delicious
well
crafted
lots
of
alcoholic
kick
to
it
true
to
its
style
so
smooth
and
chocolatey
from
vom
fass
at
the
breweryrestaurant
itself
alcohol
has
to
be
about
8
abv
drank
a
liter
slowly
as
the
alcohol
hits
you
at
the
end
very
drinkable
and
dangerous
the
atmophers
is
one
of
the
ohte
wonders
of
drinking
this
beer
in
the
heart
of
the
industrial
area
save
the
piece
of
grass
that
the
restaurants
sits
on
oh
yeah
i
dare
ya
to
get
a
oneinch
head
on
this
sucker
exceptional
color
and
appearance
rich
dark
brown
with
some
russet
hues
around
the
edges
creamy

is
produced
with
a
vigorous
pour
hearty

aroma
the
flavors
skillfully
blend
substantial
roasted
malt
subdued
dark
fruit
plum
grape
raisin
and
the
perfect
hint
of
alcohol
to
finish
it
off
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
doppel
one
of
the
best
notes
on
par
for
the
style
a
bit
placid
in
the
flavour
though
decent
drinking
through
and
through
yet
the
head
lacks
a
little
not
sure
if
i
would
drop
10
a
six
pack
again
for
this
167
this
beer
poured
a
copper
color
and
formed
an
off
white
head
that
left
trace
lace
as
it
subsided
an
aroma
of
malt
hops
and
some
candy
elements
a
flavor
of
malt
hops
and
caramel
i
found
it
to
be
fairly
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
it
wasnt
bitter
as
some
darker
beers
often
are
and
i
found
it
to
be
one
of
the
few
dark
beers
outside
of
the
british
isles
that
impressed
me
may
not
be
in
the
top
tier
but
definately
worth
checking
out
as
one
of
the
german
beers
beautiful
deep
ruby
color
big
inviting
german
malt
aroma
slightly
creamy
very
clean
and
smooth
drinking
slight
hop
bite
rounds
out
the
strong
but
not
overpowering
malt
base
almost
lacks
any
alcohol
base
complex
malt
profile
various
levels
of
sweetness
almost
like
vanilla
delicious
start
to
finish
very
nice
dark
brown
w
a
copper
hue
pours
a
very
small
creamy
head
very
little
carbonation
which
was
nice
the
aroma
is
that
of
prunes
mixed
with
caramel
and
dough
the
same
can
be
tasted
on
the
palate
this
brew
was
so
easy
to
drink
and
was
so
enjoyable
an
excellent
doppelbock
great
color
nil

farty

smooth

not
terrible
overall
boston
beer
summit
from
a
16oz
can
poured
a
dark
caramel
color
smelled
of
dark
fruits
and
yeast
scents
caramel
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
its
combination
of
yeast
caramel
and
fruit
with
an
almost
spicy
flavor
is
pleasant
would
like
to
take
in
a
whole
can
fuller
thicker
bodied
not
enough
of
this
style
in
the
market
so
i
welcome
doppelbocks
whenever
i
can
get
them
an
outstanding
winter
warmer
thatd
i
recommend
o
even
for
the
style
this
seems
a
little
under
attenuated
it
comes
off
a
little
too
sweet
and
syrupy
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
but
nothing
id
revisit
went
to
the
brewery
and
tried
this
beer
light
in
color
and
weak
in
smell
color
a
little
towards
the
red
side
but
the
taste
was
very
good
beer
from
the
tap
always
tastes
much
better
i
also
had
the
chilli
stout
which
was
great
the
brew
pub
had
good
food
and
the
city
had
a
great
port
city
feel
o
ok
so
its
probably
not
fair
to
this
beer
cause
i
think
its
more
the
style
in
general
than
this
one
in
particular
i
just
cant
drink
doppelbocks
something
about
them
just
makes
me
physically
ill
this
is
only
the
second
drainpour
of
my
life
o
hits
the
malt
notes
but
seems
to
lack
some
complexity
overall
very
much
a
traditional
bock
made
in
america
with
a
strong
german
influence
fits
the
bill
for
a
solid
dopplebock
o
this
is
very
solid
and
i
would
try
it
again
im
drinking
it
on
a
90
degree
day
but
id
rather
have
this
brew
on
a
fall
day
for
some
reason
overall
very
solid
taste
is
mild
bitter
malts
some
dried
fruit
and
a
bit
sweet
nice
balance
but
a
little
mild
in
flavors
it
hides
the
abv
very
well
and
its
easy
to
drink
overall
nice
brew
but
not
my
fav
dopplebock
overall
smell
is
good
and
appearance
is
usually
everything
but
taste
is
all
that
matters
to
me
and
this
beer
is
way
too
lager
like
and
not
enough
doppelbock
not
bad
for
a
free
old
beer
though
overall
not
a
bad
beer
very
malty
and
carbonated
its
a
nice
warming
winter
ale
o
not
a
bad
brew
and
its
a
fair
representation
of
a
dopplebock
would
like
some
more
aroma
involved
and
perhaps
a
bit
more
body
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a

the
beer
is
a

aromas
are
rich

malty
with

and
some
roasted

highlights

rich
and
complex
thankfully
it
tastes
rich
and
complex
as
well
roasty
and
smooth
there
are
some
nutty
sweet
overtones
blending
with
the
toffee

all
lends
itself
to
the
overall
layers
throughout
the
brew
smooth
and
bold
in
mouth
on
a
midbody
feel
the
beer
leaves
a
fantastic
lacing
along
the

the
aftertaste
is
a
hint
of
the
tangy
sweetness
and
roasted
flavors
leading
to

a
touch

you
can
percieve
the
alchohol
in
this
and
it
has
a
bit

much
bite
to
it

not

the
aftertaste
lingers
fairly

the
taste
is
malty
and
nothing
to
different
from
a
typical
doppel
bock
it
appears
a

lighter
then
other
doppelbocks

very

nothing

recommended
the
body
is
a

on
the
light
side
for
the

ddrinkability
is
good
it
is
on
the
heavy
side
as
it
should
be
a
nice
take
on
the
style
d
pretty
solid
beer
not
sure
if
the
bottles
make
it
down
around
here
but
ill
keep
my
eyes
open
at
the
bar
id
be
more
inclined
to
try
a
new
beer
rather
than
get
this
one
again
drinkability
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
this
is
the
best
nonpumpkin
beer
from
the
brewery
a
super
malty
treat
that
i
could
have
a
couple
of
over
time
drinkable
sure
but
a
lame
double
bock
d
this
brew
fits
the
bill
for
dopplebockbut
its
a
pretty
mediocre
oneand
an
above
average
brew
overall
the
alcohol
isnt
powerful
in
this
brewit
just
stands
out
because
there
isnt
much
flavor
there
still
cool
to
try
this
local
you
can
actually
detect
a
little
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
surprising
for
the
abv
that
being
said
this
is
still
pretty
drinkable
not
a
bad
offering
this
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
just
a
touch
of
haziness
to
it
and
a
nice
off
white
head
that
recedes
slowly
with
no
lacing
left
smells
a
bit
faint
like
dark
cherries
molasses
a
touch
of
burnt
wood
and
some
medicinal
herbal
aromas
taste
is
a
bit
off
for
me
as
i
feel
the
alcohol
burn
on
this
one
off
balanced
with
astrigenty
bitterness
that
overseas
the
malts
leaves
a
very
dry
bitter
austere
flavor
of
old
cough
syrup
mouthfeel
is
weird
becuase
its
got
a
tingly
thing
going
on
with
the
carbonation
rolls
off
the
tongue
well
but
leaves
a
bitter
dry
feeling
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
low
becuase
it
just
doesnt
taste
good
really
off
putting
and
nothing
i
would
think
would
represent
the
style
well
interesting
enough
to
try
once
but
wouldnt
get
this
again
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
bubbly
head
aroma
was
sweet
and
malty
with
a
small
touch
of
peppery
spice
taste
was
clean
kind
of
life
a
white
bread
that
had
been
covered
with
a
peppery
spice
rub
felt
outstanding
in
the
mouth
coated
very
well
not
to
thin
and
a
touch
of
carbonation
overall
very
pleasant
to
drink
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
a
toasted
almond
head
that
sticks
well
nice
bready
caramel
malt
aroma
flavor
is
pretty
close
to
style
with
a
good
showing
of
bready
malts
and
a
good
dose
of
caramel
aftertaste
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
to
warrant
a
great
drinkability
rating
but
i
love
a
good
bock
so
i
enjoyed
these
thoroughly
dgood
for
winters
up
here
in
maine
i
like
the
nuttiness
but
its
just
a
bit
sweet
overall
its
a
pretty
solid
beer
d
overall
i
really
liked
this
brew
especially
for
a
cold
new
england
winter
day
where
i
could
definitely
enjoy
some
of
these
overall
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
if
you
like
fruitynutty
beers
than
this
is
one
you
might
like
personally
i
found
it
too
fruity
but
one
or
two
can
be
enjoyable
f
finishes
sweet
still
with
more
toasty
malts
and
lots
of
brown
sugar
molasses
and
syrup
lingering
not
as
sticky
as
i
thought
it
would
be
a
slight
roasty
porter
flavor
on
the
finish
too
hints
of
bitter
spicy
earthy
hops
too
i
hate
to
say
it
but
i
did
not
like
this
beer
the
taste
was
not
good
to
me
it
has
a
smokey
taste
to
it
thats
very
strong
and
ruins
the
taste
of
the
beer
for
me
i
dont
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
quality
it
is
just
the
brew
and
ingredients
in
the
beer
dont
appeal
to
me
that
being
said
someone
else
may
like
it
ive
had
red
ales
that
i
have
liked
this
one
did
not
do
it
for
me
picked
up
a
six
pack
for
6
99
at
macys
in
wr
for
last
friday
night
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
light
brown
color
with
a
clear
body
noticeable
carbonation
some
lacing
smell
was
not
as
pronounced
as
other
doppelbocks
i
have
tried
taste
was
good
overall
though
some
dried
fruit
notes
with
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
not
as
thick
as
i
was
expecting
from
this
style
of
beer
while
its
smoothness
aided
in
the
drinkability
it
let
me
down
a
bit
as
i
was
looking
for
a
heartier
beer
for
the
evening
the
abv
is
well
hidden
navigator
is
a
dopplebock
for
those
looking
to
drink
a
few
in
one
session
interesting
flavor
that
matches
the
chocolate
covered
caramel
some
of
the
darker
malts
do
come
through
slightly
sweet
with
a
light
hop
background
rich
body
and
below
average
carbonation
would
i
buy
more
of
it
yes
especially
if
i
see
it
in
tap
somewhere
notes
the
flavor
and
the
color
stand
out
among
everything
else
its
a
decent
dopplebock
that
is
rather
drinkable
cheers
poured
into
a
standard
pint
clear
mahogany
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
to
start
but
slowly
changes
to
a
thin
film
with
good
lacing
a
sweet
roasted
malt
aroma
strong
caramel
flavor
with
that
great
double
bock
flavor
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
the
place
i
purchased
it
at
was
sold
out
when
i
went
back
there
cape
anne
is
putting
out
some
good
stuff
nice
looking
brownred
color
with
a
sliver
of
head
that
dies
out
quickly
smell
is
heavy
on
the
caramel
malts
however
for
a
dopplebock
it
doesnt
really
seem
to
have
the
punch
that
i
would
expect
the
taste
follows
suit
a
pretty
tasty
malt
profile
but
too
watery
to
really
get
excited
about
this
is
definitely
a
good
beer
to
have
with
a
meal
but
not
something
that
i
really
would
be
interested
to
drink
again
on
its
own
mediumfull
bodied
not
bad
i
guess
actually
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
nice
english
brown
ale
and
if
it
was
classified
as
such
then
i
would
possibly
give
it
a
higher
score
d
very
satisfying
could
drink
2
or
3
happily
pours
a
deep
rich
amber
though
the
head
is
almost
nonexistent
and
gone
quickly
a
nice
nose
with
prominant
dark
fruit
and
tobacco
the
taste
dlivers
figgy
and
strong
without
alotof
alcohol
to
warn
of
the
strength
it
feels
heavy
of
the
toungue
a
little
too
sugary
and
thick
to
drink
alnight
but
you
could
do
alot
worse
this
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
deep
amber
color
with
about
a
14
inch
of
offwhitetannish
head
to
it
head
recedes
quickly
barely
a
film
left
to
it
spotty
lacing
left
on
the
glass
nose
is
of
caramel
malts
toasted
malts
some
dark
fruits
and
a
touch
of
hops
taste
is
of
caramel
malts
up
front
with
dark
fruits
moving
in
to
the
backgrous
raisins
and
dates
mostly
the
finish
is
a
hop
presence
that
evens
this
beer
out
medium
body
moderate
to
light
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
nice
offering
from
cape
ann
and
certainly
one
you
could
sit
with
for
a
night
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
not
a
style
that
i
usually
drink
nor
is
it
a
brewery
that
i
usually
like
but
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
d
the
abv
is
hidden
pretty
well
but
this
one
will
sneak
up
on
you
not
a
session
beer
the
overall
affect
is
very
warming
so
one
of
these
on
a
cool
night
will
hit
the
spot
i
have
not
had
a
lot
of
this
style
of
beer
so
im
new
too
it
this
one
was
very
enjoyable
d
the
body
and
sweetness
make
this
a
great
beer
i
would
order
a
pint
or
two
of
this
in
the
cooler
months
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
in
that
the
controlling
flavor
is
caramel
malt
good
carbonation
level
nothing
too
overwhelming
and
unfortunately
for
this
beer
nothing
too
special
a
fairly
run
of
the
mill
doppelbock
and
if
i
didnt
know
any
better
id
almost
classify
this
as
a
regular
bock
because
theres
none
of
that
wow
factor
with
flavors
or
alcohol
strength
that
other
doppelbocks
come
with
although
i
guess
it
is
good
that
the
7
5
is
wellhidden
in
my
pilsner
glass
this
beer
was
a
cherry
amber
color
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
it
had
a
sweet
fruity
aroma
it
had
a
caramel
malt
taste
a
lot
of
fruit
it
was
a
little
on
the
bland
side
i
thought
it
was
too
sweet
and
on
the
thin
side
ive
had
better
doppelbocks
drinkability
if
you
are
inthe
mood
for
a
malty
and
sweeter
beer
this
will
hit
the
spot
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
on
the
store
shelf
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
a
bit
syrupy
and
a
touch
cloying
the
sweetness
has
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
sweet
caramels
some
fig
or
raisin
and
then
there
are
some
rust
like
tastes
this
get
sweeter
and
less
rusty
as
the
beer
settles
and
warms
i
never
found
the
bocks
to
be
overly
complex
and
this
one
is
no
exception
the
beers
dont
have
much
carbonation
and
remind
me
too
much
of
flat
cola
syrup
with
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
in
the
finish
to
let
you
know
youre
not
drinking
a
non
carbonated
beverage
pours
rustic
amber
almost
rustbrown
with
little
fanfare
smells
strongly
yeasty
and
sweet
with
an
almost
citrusy
smell
slight
sweetness
throughout
an
interesting
hop
punch
at
the
end
no
malt
punch
no
taste
of
dark
fruits
or
anything
like
that
it
has
something
undescribeable
about
it
it
almost
taste
rusty
not
literally
rusty
but
like
a
little
dingy
finishes
dry
and
toasty
toast
like
bread
seems
to
have
a
metallic
aftertaste
low
on
carbonation
seems
fairly
light
in
body
for
the
style
lacks
creaminess
doesnt
really
flow
well
overall
a
hearty
meh
there
are
so
many
better
examples
of
the
style
this
one
doesnt
actively
offend
but
the
metallic
taste
seems
to
come
out
more
and
more
as
it
goes
on
thats
the
big
offender
here
pours
a
clear
pretty
dark
brown
with
a
thin
eggshell
creme
head
nose
is
a
toasty
malted
thing
flavor
is
a
bit
cloying
on
the
sweet
side
beyond
that
there
is
a
thick
malt
presence
as
times
goes
on
and
the
drinking
does
too
the
sweetness
becomes
less
intense
and
more
smooth
though
the
malty
sweetness
does
remain
feel
is
thicker
slick
and
smooth
on
liquid
carbonation
is
lower
and
appropriate
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
overall
not
too
shabby
its
a
difficult
style
to
pull
off
notes
not
a
bad
bock
and
not
bad
overallyet
i
got
the
feeling
the
metallic
tone
would
hurt
the
rating
and
it
did
its
weird
that
outside
of
the
north
shore
of
boston
you
dont
find
much
of
the
cape
ann
brewerys
offerings
in
pubs
around
its
more
bizarre
to
find
a
few
of
their
beers
then
in
brooklyn
oh
well
i
suppose
it
gives
more
cred
to
the
skinnyjeaned
beard
posses
regardless
i
was
happy
to
find
indulge
a
nice
shimmering
pour
of
dark
brownhoney
sat
with
a
short
head
but
some
good
white
lacing
the
aroma
was
good
malty
almost
a
caramel
spread
on
toasted
wheat
bread
with
raisins
the
flavor
continued
this
but
added
a
strange
almost
garden
soil
pepper
taste
which
added
some
girth
but
odd
nonetheless
dry
hops
finished
the
taste
off
a
strange
but
appealing
dark
lager
i
wouldnt
quite
call
it
a
doppel
bock
though
drinkability
its
not
exactly
the
most
graceful
adroit
dopplebock
on
the
dopple
block
the
slightly
astringent
graininess
in
the
latter
half
mars
the
overall
experience
its
a
dry
interpretation
maltiness
is
there
but
subdued
not
bad
but
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
not
really
what
i
look
for
in
the
style
had
a
bottle
at
liberty
st
tavern
poured
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
this
beer
was
a
little
light
for
a
doppel
certainly
a
bit
more
attenuated
than
imports
im
used
to
the
aroma
and
flavor
however
have
a
pleasant
vanilla
character
with
plums
and
sugar
candy
this
is
still
a
wellmade
dark
lager
just
not
a
truetostyle
doppelbock
i
say
its
worth
a
try
i
enjoyed
it
d
notes
a
nice
big
rich
dopplebock
missing
some
light
ester
highlights
that
probably
would
have
improved
the
beer
for
a
bigger
alcohol
beer
very
drinkable
pours
a
clear
but
dark
ruby
red
with
a
small
head
and
slow
moving
carbonation
aromas
are
very
subtle
sweet
caramel
and
a
some
phenols
taste
is
cloying
but
bearable
some
spiciness
and
dark
fruits
at
least
make
the
powerful
sweetness
interesting
not
a
bad
beer
but
far
from
my
favorite
of
the
style
i
cant
find
much
to
say
about
this
one
its
on
the
sweeter
side
of
doppelbocks
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
it
seems
like
this
is
closer
to
a
darker
bock
than
a
doppelbock
worth
a
try
not
bad
a
great
example
of
a
dopplebock
with
a
bit
of
the
smoky
and
woody
notes
that
dont
always
come
forth
in
dopplebocks
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
of
those
before
growing
tired
not
one
i
would
regularly
drink
or
necessarily
seek
out
but
definitely
a
solid
offering
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
worth
drinking
a
bottle
or
two
if
you
have
the
opportunity
hard
to
knock
more
than
one
down
good
rep
of
the
style
but
1
was
enough
for
the
night
a
6
would
take
a
while
for
me
to
get
through
very
decent
beer
though
if
you
like
the
style
d
without
an
acquired
taste
for
bocks

5this
is
my
5th
doppelbock
to
date
considering
the
other
four
where
celebrator
with
an
impressive
i
thought
this
was
an
ok
beer
with
just
a
tad
of
cloying
smooth
overall
in
the
drinkability
area
nice
dry
finish
edchicmamar
07
with
average
to
good
bubbly
lacing
aroma
is
fruity
malts
but
after
warming
up
to
it
one
of
the
top
beers
in
germany
according
to
this
sight
and
i
have
to
admit
its
taken
me
awhile
to
fine
one
and
i
may
have
been
blinded
slightly
by
the
hype
but
as
i
sit
down
to
this
frothing
glass
of
crystal
clear
but
super
dark
brown
brew
that
is
kriek
cherry
red
in
bright
light
do
i
realize
and
appreciate
just
how
good
this
is
sometimes
i
think
we
lose
track
of
traditional
styles
and
how
good
the
good
ones
are
people
dont
rave
about
dopplebock
it
doesnt
have
pounds
of
dry
hops
bacteria
or
bourbon
barrels
so
it
slips
under
the
radar
and
that
is
unfortunate
because
it
is
deserving
of
far
higher
praise
as
that
style
goes
this
one
is
one
of
the
better
going
beautiful
caramelized
barley
sugars
here
in
nose
and
taste
and
ancient
yeast
strain
and
a
pleasing
softness
its
so
simple
but
yet
so
deep
like
a
well
made
bread
pudding
save
some
of
the
residual
sugar
feels
like
the
one
that
is
most
often
copied
its
hard
to
call
it
as
nuanced
as
some
of
the
crazy
wilds
out
there
but
its
quality
is
through
the
roof
amazing
its
a
lager
i
often
think
that
with
dopplebock
but
especially
here
there
is
so
much
yeast
flavor
affordable
world
class
german
beer
has
the
weird
distinction
of
being
shelf
turd
material
here
in
colorado
i
hate
that
because
this
is
what
beer
should
be
and
beer
economy
but
i
can
only
imagine
this
fresh
on
tap
at
the
source
oh
baby
pours
cola
brown
with
khaki
head
and
lots
of
sticky
lacing
smells
of
licorice
fig
and
chocolate
mouth
coating
feel
with
a
load
of
spice
and
a
little
alcohol
kicking
in
the
forefront
and
a
raisonette
background
overall
really
subtly
complex
and
delicious
pours
two
fingers
foamy
brown
head
great
retention
very
firm
lacing
head
fades
eventually
to
a
thin
film
with
odd
little
islands
of
froth
amidst
the
film
dark
brown
though
not
cloudy
light
amber
shining
through
sweet
roasted
malty
nose
smells
of
dried
cherries
and
a
hint
of
cranberries
tastes
of
milk
chocolate
caramel
some
cocoa
followed
by
darker
fruits
and
coffee
on
aftertaste
long
after
the
last
sip
i
detect
some
lingering
metallic
tartness
toward
back
of
tongue
very
creamy
velvety
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
with
a
medium
dry
finish
this
is
a
very
pleasant
dopplebock
with
a
fine
balance
and
hides
its
stronger
alcohol
well
not
overly
complex
great
feel
and
body
a
real
treat
will
definitely
buy
again
overall
very
easy
drinking
so
smooth
delicious
excellent
beer
i
first
had
it
in
d
cs
churchkey
and
it
knocked
my
socks
off
excellent
sweetness
to
counter
the
dark
chocolatelike
bitterness
overall
really
well
balanced
you
almost
expect
it
to
be
darker
and
more
viscous
than
it
is
if
youre
a
fan
of
samual
smiths
oatmeal
stout
then
you
might
be
a
fan
of
this
too
they
definitely
arent
identical
of
course
just
same
kind
of
sweetness
and
balance
from
a
darker
beer
o
this
beer
is
focused
it
certainly
knows
what
it
wants
to
be
and
is
just
that
a
solid
doppelbock
overall
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
and
well
worth
the
wait
overall
an
outstanding
brew
owow
what
an
awesome
beer
this
thing
really
blows
me
away
i
have
always
enjoyed
doppelbocks
but
this
is
a
whole
new
level
of
complexity
balance
and
flavor
if
you
want
hops
go
elsewhere
but
if
you
want
a
delicious
fullbody
winter
beer
you
will
have
to
work
hard
to
do
better
than
this
picked
up
at
a
bottle
shop
in
san
fran
might
have
been
old
because
while
it
looked
and
smelled
okay
the
taste
was
just
off
and
certainly
not
worthy
of
the
praise
this
one
typically
gets
would
be
willing
to
try
again
though
some
mocha
on
the
finish
long
subtle
bitterness
not
celebrator
not
by
a
mile
but
still
a
beer
that
the
maker
should
be
proud
of
o
really
good
dopplebock
i
would
prefer
a
little
less
of
the
dark
fruit
and
more
roasted
malt
still
very
good
but
ayinger
dopplebock
still
my
go
to
on
draft
at
papago
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
once
the
head
went
away
beer
was
sweet
and
malty
low
carbonation
great
german
beer
character
o
i
dont
get
any
of
the
cocoa
that
is
mentioned
in
other
reviews
this
is
exactly
what
i
expect
from
a
dependable
german
dopplebock
i
dont
rate
is
as
highly
as
others
but
it
is
a
good
beer
fantastic
beer
malts
caramel
dark
fruits
i
could
have
this
all
day
long
thumbs
up
a
very
nice
dark
bockbier
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
white
head
and
good
clarity
aroma
of
caramel
brown
sugar
toffee
and
slight
alcohol
once
again
clean
malt
flavor
in
the
taste
with
all
due
caramel
there
is
just
a
hint
of
smoked
meat
in
the
integrity
of
the
roasted
malts
caramel
dark
fruits
raw
sugar
but
balanced
and
graceful
malty
robust
flavor
not
too
sweet
nor
strong
this
is
a
world
class
beer
top
notch
doppelbock
brewed
perfectly
to
style
i
feel
lucky
to
have
found
such
a
wonderful
indigenous
german
doppelbock
so
close
to
home
absolutely
beautiful
everything
the
brewers
notes
claim
it
to
be
pours
perfectly
and
drinks
perfectly
nose
is
rich
and
crisp
malt
taste
is
enveloping
malt
with
a
touch
of
hops
to
back
it
up
a
delight
of
complexity
as
the
malt
unfolds
with
bread
cocoa
and
dark
fruit
perfect
mouthfeel
with
the
right
little
bite
from
carbonation
overall
a
very
nice
doppelbock
being
a
little
more
roasted
and
chocolate
and
less
fruity
then
others
while
not
the
best
out
there
it
is
very
good
overall
and
is
certainly
one
to
try
if
you
get
the
chance
a
complex
yet
easy
drinking
beer
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
this
bottle
was
very
reasonably
priced
at
3something
for
the
bottle
wow
for
real
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
im
always
looking
for
after
hearing
about
this
brew
for
the
past
thirty
years
we
finally
have
a
wholesaler
that
is
bringing
in
the
sh
brands
portfolio
of
which
the
andechs
brands
are
included
and
yet
for
some
reason
said
wholesaler
doesnt
bring
in
andechs
what
a
shame
id
love
to
try
this
sidebyside
with
a
korbinian
or
three
cheers
all
o
like
a
slice
of
fresh
black
bread
in
a
glass
amazing
pours
dark
copper
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
vibrant
red
with
hints
of
gold
is
revealed
almost
no
head
and
minimal
lacing
smells
of
toffee
cookies
butter
wood
banana
malt
and
sweet
bread
taste
is
bready
with
hints
of
roasted
caramel
very
light
brown
sugar
and
more
toffee
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
had
initially
suggested
an
light
and
airy
mouthfeel
with
very
little
carbonation
good
balance
to
the
flavors
finishes
fast
and
pleasant
without
much
linger
a
very
drinkable
and
delicious
beer
super
balanced
smooth
and
easy
drinking
an
excellent
doppelbock
pours
into
a
half
liter
stein
a
deep
garnet
color
with
a
off

crown
atoplove
the
rich
full

buttery
caramel

dark
german
maltiness

has
an

tinge
to
it
buttery
rum
flavorsalmost
like
a
rum
ball
with
that
butteriness
sticking
around
for
awhile
with
some
chocolate
coming
in
the
finish
but
not
overly
sweet
worthy
of
the
praise
this
beer
is
not
in
your
face
and
it
doesnt
hit
to
hard
in
one
aspectjust
a
great
all
around
doppelbock
very
smooth
drinking
with
less
of
that
port
wine
rummy
taste
characteristic
of
the
style
i
would
still
prefer
a
weizenbock
but
this
is
very
good
not
too
sweet
fully
loaded
with
caramel
and
burnt
sugar
i
would
rank
this
third
behind
einbecker
winter
bock
and
korbinian
no
hindsight
required
here
its
truly
deserving
of
a
5
in
my
book
im
glad
i
had
an
opportunity
to
indulge
and
will
seek
this
one
out
again

was
surprised
when
a
homebrew
club
member
showed
up
with
one
of
these
and
had
no
idea
how
good
its
supposed
to
be
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
quickly
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
a
lot
of
nutty
and
bready
things
going
on
with
some
caramel
maltiness
backing
things
up
the
flavor
is
better
than
expected
very
smooth
lots
of
notes
of
nuttiness
and
caramel
hitns
of
fruits
the
drinkability
is
very
good
as
is
the

not

thats

overall
drinkability
what
a
very
interesting
beer
i
wish
i
had
a
bigger
glass
of
it
to
work
out
all
the
flavors
very
drinkable
this
went
down
quickly
and
then
that
higher
abv
let
me
know
it
was
there
i
could
easily
see
myself
getting
a
6
pack
of
this
next
time
i
can
do
so
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
ayinger
celebrator
but
not
as
deep
in
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
a
tad
disappointing
for
this
style
but
otherwise
a
very
good
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
stemmed
vase
the
beer
is
a
auburnhighlighted
brown
coloring
with
a
thin
sparse
cream
colored
surface
coating
of
head
aromas
of
rich
toffee
and
caramel
forward
with
date
raisin
and
cherry
sweet
and
rich
highlights
roasted
highlights
keep
the
sweet
reigned
in
making
this
a
very
balanced
nose
flavors
are
roasted
heavily
on
the
forward
tongue
with
rich
toffee
chocolate
and
caramel
notes
the
oldworld
fruit
characteristics
are
present
in
highlight
form
and
there
are
some
earthy
notes
as
well
this
is
a
tasty
maltbomb
smooth
and
robust
in
mouth
with
a
slight
effervesced
edge
to
keep
the
drinkability
up
the
aftertaste
is
surprisingly
crisp
keeping
all
the
sweet
characteristics
from
becoming
overpowering
smooth
slick
finish
with
only
a
minimally
sweet
linger
thanks
to
the
carbonation
solid
brew
peace
the
rest
really
really
good
this
is
a
topnotch
dopple
great
balance
great
flavor
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
o
the
mouthfeel
on
this
is
weird
as
it
starts
out
syrupy
an
thick
then
kinda
thins
out
the
aroma
is
fantastic
and
the
taste
delivers
nicely
as
well
rich
roasty
meal
in
a
glass
o
an
exceptional
dopplebock
worth
seeking
out
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
in
body
with
carbonation
of
low
intensity
resulting
in
a
mostly
smooth
910
mouthfeel
with
just
a
touch
of
foaminess
110
that
results
in
very
slow
sips
of
a
lingering
nature
some
more
carbonation
could
be
present
and
the
beer
would
benefit
in
both
aromatics
and
drinkability
closes
dry
with
heavy
stickiness
lingering
on
the
palate
just
right
for
the
style
o
this
beer
has
very
good
drinkability
for
the
styleit
isnt
bogged
down
with
malty
flavors
or
much
in
the
way
of
alcohol
overall
this
one
has
nice
and
big
sweet
flavors
with
lots
of
malt
a
rather
tasty
doppelbock
that
is
well
worth
a
try
the
beer
appears
a
dark
shade
of
mahogany
with
a
half
inch
of
foamy
beige
head
the
aroma
offers
dark
malts
brown
sugar
bread
alcohol
ripe
plums
raisins
sweet
brown
bread
cookies
alcohol
yeast
definitely
true
to
style
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
a
solid
beer
o
i
think
this
is
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
that
is
quite
enjoyable
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
poured
a
brownish
body
with
onefinger
offwhite
head
that
died
a
slow
death
with
no
lace
a
thick
rich
aroma
mostly
bready
and
roasted
malts
along
with
some
dark
chocolate
sweetness
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
more
of
the
same
as
the
beer
is
thick
fullerbodied
not
sticky
nor
watery
but
a
nice
thick
smoothness
mixed
roasted
and
breadlike
malts
for
dryness
with
dark
chocolate
toffee
and
caramel
for
sweetness
not
typical
of
other
dbs
ive
had
in
terms
of
the
dryness
and
the
finish
which
is
less
sweet
more
dry
and
not
much
in
terms
of
any
fruit
flavors
at
all
cant
say
i
really
got
a
hold
of
any
dark
fruits
or
minor
citric
hops
but
still
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
have
to
agree
duck
rabbit
is
the
dark
beer
specialist
they
sure
got
this
one
right
glad
i
was
finally
able
to
get
some
of
this
one
just
never
seemed
to
be
in
nc
when
it
was
released
o
this
is
a
really
odd
doppelbock
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
although
this
is
better
than
most
i
have
encountered
lots
going
on
here
i
can
see
where
the
hype
comes
from
just
not
for
me
overall
potent
in
many
of
its
aspect
its
not
the
best
doppelbock
to
be
had
though
im
sure
you
could
do
worse
overall
nice
dopple
not
a
standout
imo
but
decent
enough
brew
another
great
duckrabbit
beer
and
a
solid
doppelbock
that
im
happy
to
have
made
in
nc
really
need
to
make
that
trip
to
farmville
not
a
bad
doppelbock
it
had
an
interesting
color
a
sweet
aroma
a
dry
roasted
taste
and
an
alcoholic
mouthfeel
i
think
this
nc
brewery
did
a
good
job
the
aroma
could
have
been
better
but
everything
else
was
good
would
i
drink
another
one
yeah
i
wouldnt
mind
another
single
overall
i
am
very
unimpressed
with
this
offering
from
duck
rabbit
there
is
just
an
overall
lack
of
everything
from
the
aroma
to
the
flavor
to
the
mouthfeel
way
too
much
dms
and
a
lack
of
much
malt
or
hops
maybe
this
has
improved
since
the
batch
i
got
but
i
really
cant
recommend
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
alcohol
caramel
some
dark
fruits
taste
is
a
bit
boozy
some
dark
fruit
and
malts
alcohol
is
prevelent
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
o
not
much
of
a
dopplebock
guy
but
this
isnt
bad
a
little
too
malty
and
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
definitely
enjoyable
over
the
course
of
time
i
really
shouldve
reviewed
some
of
the
earlier
doppelbocks
i
had
from
this
mixed
case
as
maybe
ive
left
it
in
the
cellar
too
long
given
the
discrepancy
between
my
experience
and
the
overall
ba
community
o
as
stated
i
feel
this
brew
is
very
true
to
the
traditional
doppelbock
style
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
a
killer
doppelbock
and
this
baby
delivers
the
goods
i
searched
for
this
brew
for
over
two
years
and
it
was
definitely
worth
the
wait
i
can
heartily
recommend
searching
it
out
i
had
this
on
tap
expecting
an
awesome
doppelbock
but
got
something
else
it
looked
good
nice
deep
amber
color
good
off
white
head
the
smell
was
ok
malty
a
little
whiff
of
pepper
the
taste
was
off
it
was
way
too
sweet
and
not
malty
sweet
it
was
cherry
sweet
no
bitterness
i
took
a
drink
of
water
to
make
sure
it
wasnt
something
else
nope
same
thing
it
was
thick
and
chewy
low
carbonation
i
am
bummed
by
this
i
love
a
good
doppelbock
o
top
tier
doppelbock
not
in
ayinger
celebrators
league
but
not
far
from
it
3

overall
its
pretty
awesome
i
didnt
check
the
abv
until
after
i
tasted
it
and
im
pretty
shocked
this
beer
masks
its
alcohol
very
well
with
its
full
body
o
great
selection
must
try
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
as
the
reviews
are
generally
positive
for
this
one
but
its
got
all
the
infected
duckrabbit
characteristics
going
on
aside
from
the
gigantic
head
in
fact
this
one
is
nearly
flat
after
the
initial
pour
aroma
in
particular
reminds
me
a
lot
of
their
2012
barleywine
disaster
never
had
a
sour
or
funky
doppelbock
before
so
ive
got
to
assume
this
is
not
what
the
brewer
was
shooting
for
in
an
effort
to
be
fair
i
will
try
one
more
bottle
just
in
case
this
one
was
an
anomaly
and
will
adjust
my
review
accordingly
if
needed
as
it
stands
right
now
this
is
a
terrible
doppelbock
fought
through
half
the
glass
but
the
rest
is
going
down
the
drain
the
chestnut
colored
body
clear
and
the
beige
head
was
fed
by
gentle
carbonation
the
smell
was
ripe
with
figs
dates
cherries
and
dark
raisins
the
taste
was
not
as
sweet
as
i
had
anticipated
the
malts
appeared
to
be
well
roasted
giving
a
bitter
coffee
effect
at
first
sip
this
was
followed
by
a
fruity
tartness
semisweet
powdered
cocoa
and
a
woody
dry
finish
this
was
a
surprisingly
complex
juxtaposition
of
flavors
for
the
style
the
body
was
not
as
silky
smooth
as
the
best
examples
of
the
style
quite
a
different
experience
from
others
of
this
style
o
definitely
a
good
beer
at
this
point
in
my
taste
buds
career
i
want
flavors
that
are
a
bit
stronger
but
i
appreciate
the
high
drinkability
for
a
fairly
alcoholic
beer
and
the
many
subtle
flavors
even
if
i
did
appreciate
the
balance
more
however
i
feel
that
a
doppelbock
should
ram
you
with
its
two
horns
im
so
clever
a
bit
more
roughly
if
the
malty
toffee
flavor
could
be
a
bit
more
rich
and
then
you
could
discern
the
others
flavored
i
mentioned
just
a
little
more
faintly
i
think
this
beer
would
be
outstanding
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
head
that
dies
down
to
a
soapy
film
of
bubbles
a
strong
caramel
aroma
with
some
peat
and
a
touch
of
cherry
very
clean
aroma
a
bit
of
toasted
malt
flavor
at
first
that
blends
with
a
bit
of
cherry
and
a
nice
butterscotch
flavor
a
medium
feel
with
a
nice
smooth
body
and
a
bit
of
syrup
coats
the
tongue
with
a
sweet
finish
on
par
with
optimator
and
salvator
another
dangerous
session
beer
great
flavor
and
you
cant
detect
any
alcohol
mainly
considering
the
146pack
it
costs
id
prefer
to
buy
a
fair
amount
of
other
things
for
10
so
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
also
glad
i
got
a
single
bottle
for
3
overall
a
very
solid
offering
from
duck
rabbit
this
was
the
first
real
beer
i
loved
from
them
and
the
2013
batch
is
no
different
for
some
reason
these
are
only
going
for
7
496
pack
right
now
and
at
that
price
im
going
to
be
picking
up
a
case
this
is
a
very
nicely
flavored
doppelbock
its
complex
and
very
drinkable
with
a
well
hidden
abv
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
duck
rabbit
httpwww
dudeletter
comp1303
pretty
drinkable
not
worldclass
but
pretty
decent
however
at
14
a
sixer
i
would
probably
pass
on
this
one
again
in
bottled
form
this
one
did
grow
on
me
as
it
warmed
overall
this
beer
was
just
what
i
wanted
tonight
full
of
malt
goodness
it
would
be
extremely
good
if
it
were
a
bit
smoother
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
have
had
this
last
beer
of
a
6
pack
since
august
11
so
it
has
aged
about
6
months
on
top
of
the
brewingaging
timeline
i
look
forward
to
getting
to
nc
so
i
can
get
somemore
overall
this
beer
company
impresses
me
every
time
with
beers
and
to
make
a
dopplebock
almost
9
this
smooth
and
creamy
is
exceptional
i
would
buy
it
more
often
if
i
could
find
it
in
more
places
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
would
purchase
again

a

alcohol
has
a
decent
presence
with
a
decent
warming
on
the
finish
overall
a
very
nice
and
impressive
doppelbock
the
alcohol
presence
is
a
bit
much
but
overall
still
very
enjoyable
good
but
definitely
not
your
typical
doppelbock
malts
are
the
centerpiece
but
theyre
quite
roasty
and
slightly
smoky
smell
is
the
highlight
i
think
the
best
qualities
of
the
taste
are
pulled
down
by
that
odd
alcohol
bite
and
the
mouthfeel
is
just
too
bubbly
overall
a
really
solid
dark
beer
that
i
enjoyed
greatly
and
hope
to
enjoy
again
o
unusual
doppelbock
and
nicely
refined
a
deviation
from
what
i
usually
anticipate
to
be
too
sweet
and
overly
esterized
this
one
is
nice
overall
this
is
a
onsietwosie
not
something
i
would
drink
more
than
2
of
in
a
night
maybe
a
desert
beer
give
it
some
body
lose
a
little
alcohol
and
it
could
be
duck
rabbits
money
maker
bottle
poured
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
small
lingering
tan
head
aromas
of
molasses
caramel
toffee
cocoa
and
light
fruittiness
palate
was
medium
bodied
and
crisp
flavors
of
molasses
toffee
caramel
and
light
cocoa
with
a
crisp
lingering
toffee
finish
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
that
shows
moderate
retention
and
minimal
lace
smells
of
dark
dried
fruit
caramel
and
burnt
sugar
with
a
hint
of
ash
mixed
in
there
as
well
taste
is
dark
malty
with
a
hint
of
mineral
and
ash
all
the
usual
suspects
are
here
caramel
dark
sugar
prunes
plums
raisins
light
roasted
grains
are
a
bit
out
of
place
little
to
no
hop
presence
but
there
really
shouldnt
be
medium
to
thick
body
light
level
of
carbonation
with
a
caramel
thick
mouthfeel
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
but
this
is
one
damn
fine
brew
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
roasted
grains
and
all
d
this
is
a
really
solid
doppelbock
from
duckrabbit
it
has
a
really
nice
balance
of
chocolates
and
dark
fruits
i
feel
most
doppelbocks
are
one
dimensional
on
the
malts
but
this
has
a
really
nice
interplay
in
and
out
of
a
variety
of
flavors
highly
recommended
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
o
an
atypical
doppelbock
that
seems
to
border
more
on
a
porter
than
a
doppelbock
still
it
is
quite
tasty
with
a
nice
combination
of
sweet
chocolate
and
nutty
flavors
and
aromas
edit
wow
so
that
alcoholic
tartness
definitely
gets
to
you
further
down
in
the
beer
i
had
to
lower
my
score
a
bit
rich
fullbodied
light
effervescence
slightly
ashy
note
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
really
fine
bottle
of
brew
now
if
they
would
only
distribute
in
florida
a
dark
mahogany
colored
brew
with
a
decent
tan
colored
foam
on
top
with
nice
lacing
the
aroma
brings
big
peanut
butter
malt
with
a
hint
of
ham
and
muted
licorice
cotton
candy
quite
nice
the
flavor
favors
licorice
malt
by
far
and
its
delicious
with
banana
bread
sweetness
and
a
little
charcoal
and
lemony
grass
hop
a
really
good
doppelbock
it
has
a
resinous
feel
silky
smooth
in
a
mediumheavy
bodied
brew
with
tiny
bubbles
that
keep
it
a
touch
lively
quite
a
brew
enjoy
poured
out
as
a
really
deep
brown
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
light
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
light
peppery
note
to
me
followed
up
by
some
big
malt
aromas
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
i
feel
that
ive
had
better
tasting
doppelbocks
before
this
one
just
didnt
seem
like
it
was
all
there
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
leaves
a
caramely
sweet
feeling
in
the
mouth
overall
its
a
good
brew
to
try
but
i
dont
think
ill
buy
it
again
o
great
glass
for
a
nightcap
nice
example
of
the
style
just
one
per
evening
i
think
overall
aside
from
unexpected
licorice
this
is
kind
of
disappointing
too
watery
for
my
tastes
it
is
a
measure
of
the
high
regard
that
i
hold
this
brewery
in
that
this
beer
ranks
as
a
slight
disappointment
o
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
one
but
it
fell
a
bit
short
of
expectations
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
but
its
a
bit
pricey
and
im
not
sure
ill
be
seeking
it
out
again
i
think
a
change
in
the
body
of
this
beer
would
do
wonders
for
it
o
duckrabbits
duckrabbator
doppeldock
is
a
pretty
impressive
offering
its
one
of
the
more
flavorful
doppelbocks
ive
had
and
certainly
did
well
with
a
year
in
the
ol
cellar
the
mouthfeel
could
use
some
touching
up
but
otherwise
this
one
gets
a
hearty
reco
from
me
o
overall
a
very
good
doppelbock
lots
of
fruit
and
malts
and
a
great
nose
would
like
to
have
it
again
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
sweet
up
front
and
surprisingly
dry
at
the
end
of
the
beer
it
is
sort
of
bitter
with
a
coffee
like
roast
on
the
end
it
was
nice
but
not
the
best
doppelbock
ive
ever
had
interesting
with
the
roast
character
though
mo
very
crisp
and
drinkable
beer
very
balanced
flavors
and
not
too
overwhelming
with
the
alcohol
the
beer
presents
well
and
also
really
has
some
nice
complexity
o
a
maltbomb
big
roasted
flavors
lots
of
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
balancing
bitterness
makes
for
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
i
have
yet
to
meet
the
dopplebock
that
i
didnt
like
and
this
is
no
exception
worth
checking
out
especially
if
you
like
heavily
malted
beers
overall
this
beer
is
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
but
its
a
bit
too
one
dimensional
and
sweet
for
my
liking
another
solid
offering
from
duck
rabbit
but
nothing
extraordinary
overall
a
very
enjoyable
doppelbock
that
id
score
higher
if
the
taste
was
as
good
as
the
nose
i
like
what
duck
rabbit
is
doing
and
this
is
no
exception
o
pretty
good
overall
the
bite
of
alcohol
can
be
a
bit
offputting
but
it
works
very
well
with
the
dark
chocolate
taste
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
will
definitely
buy
this
again
duck
rabbator
pours
a
very
dark
brown
its
almost
stoutlike
in
appearance
a
three
and
a
half
finger
caramel
head
pops
up
and
fades
fast
and
clean
at
first
at
about
a
finger
and
a
half
though
things
slow
down
and
some
serious
head
retention
kicks
in
theres
a
solid
amount
of
lacing
left
clinging
to
the
side
of
the
glass
as
well
the
nose
is
a
bit
unexciting
its
very
heavy
on
biscuity
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
plums
showing
up
as
well
with
my
expectations
somewhat
tapered
the
first
few
sips
then
were
a
revelation
duck
rabbator
is
a
seamless
blend
of
just
about
everything
one
could
want
from
a
malt
heavy
beer
biscuit
caramel
toasted
nuts
cocoa
and
dark
sweet
fruits
all
have
a
turn
shining
through
the
body
is
spot
on
lush
and
full
the
carbonation
though
is
a
bit
lackluster
dont
get
me
wrong
in
a
beer
like
this
im
looking
for
the
carbonation
to
be
a
bit
on
the
low
side
but
its
almost
nonexistent
here
and
the
beer
is
bordering
a
bit
on
being
syrupy
in
some
ways
duck
rabbator
is
a
world
class
doppelbock
but
its
also
a
somewhat
uneven
brew
d
the
booze
is
hidden
well
for
the
style
pretty
sweet
beer
but
not
out
of
line
with
the
style
a
nice
beer
and
a
solid
doppelbock
but
not
the
best
around
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
huge
frothy
offwhite
head
that
lasted
throughout
and
had
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
roasted
dark
bread
malts
a
sweet
leathery
yeast
with
hints
of
coffee
chocolate
toffee
raisons
and
a
mild
alcohol
scent
it
tasted
lightly
sweet
with
a
mild
coffee
overtone
at
first
and
ended
with
a
chocolatecoffee
flavor
with
notes
of
raisons
and
had
a
slightly
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
and
kind
of
watery
in
texture
and
had
a
flat
carbonation
overall
a
tasty
brew
but
not
too
exciting
traders
note
many
thanx
to
cdflem
for
a
6er
of
this
one
drinkability
an
excellent
doppelbock
and
im
upset
i
hadnt
had
a
chance
to
try
this
one
sooner
at
8
5
its
dangerous
though
not
stylistically
and
that
8
5
is
nowhere
to
be
found
this
ones
a
definite
winner
probably
the
best
duck
rabbit
brew
ive
had
i
think
id
put
it
a
step
above
any
of
their
seasonals
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
baltic
porter
and
a
real
flavorful
bomb
very
nice
well
overcarbonated
this
dark
concoction
with
little
head
attacked
my
palate
and
did
not
go
heavy
a
rich
chocolate
pepper
tabbacco
i
was
ok
with
it
but
got
more
than
my
fill
of
beer
today
from
it
for
this
style
turn
it
down
less
is
more
and
closer
to
the
target
slightly
viscous
for
the
style
with
a
low
carbination
level
not
best
enjoyed
quickly
this
one
is
better
slow
and
with
a
good
read
d
this
was
surprisingly
good
and
is
probably
the
best
thing
ive
had
from
duck
rabbit
id
definitely
include
this
in
a
doppelbock
showdown
went
through
my
12oz
shockingly
fast
it
tastes
intially
sweet
with
blasts
of
malty
goodness
finishes
with
long
yeastie
fruity
notes
not
bitter
at
all
the
alcohol
seems
more
noticeable
in
taste
than
in
smell
mediumplus
bodied
very
full
and
creamy
mouthfeel
another
winner
from
a
great
brewery
this
is
a
very
nice
doppelbock
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
traditional
german
doppelbock
but
it
is
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
style
i
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
sa
perfect
pint
glass
the
pour
is
deep
black
with
amber
highlights
about
a
1
inch
head
light
lacing
the
beer
has
a
ton
of
dark
sweet
fruit
on
the
nose
the
beer
taste
like
it
smells
dates
plums
and
a
bit
of
warming
alcohol
it
has
a
lingering
sweet
finish
a
full
bodied
well
carbonated
brew
a
very
good
doppelbock
overall
it
is
pretty
good
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
color
is
dark
mahogany
with
a
nice
tan
head
and
some
good
retention
the
nose
is
dark
fruits
roasted
malt
caramel
nuts
chocolate
really
nice
and
presents
an
elegant
complexity
the
taste
is
the
same
and
some
brown
sugar
mixes
well
with
the
fruits
and
chocolate
fairly
thick
body
with
good
carbonation
drinks
quite
well
overall
and
is
very
nice
drinkability
good
d
about
average
it
was
interesting
not
unpleasant
but
not
necessarily
something
i
would
hunt
out
again
bottle
poured
into
the
duck
rabbit
snifter
score
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
reddish
hue
slight
tan
head
that
collars
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
sweet
malty
caramel
with
some
slight
vanilla
wow
this
has
an
almost
butterscotch
flavor
with
a
bit
of
carmelization
and
roast
some
dark
fruits
as
well
medium
mouthfeel
the
ending
is
slightly
bitter
that
lingers
on
for
a
while
no
lace
at
all
overall
not
bad
but
not
outstanding
either
overall
a
decent
dopplebock
some
heavy
flavors
here
somewhat
drinkable
i
dig
it
d
not
sure
what
style
to
compare
this
to
on
a
drinkability
level
almost
drinks
like
a
lighter
scotch
ale
thanks
to
bucketboy
for
the
generous
extra
served
in
my
dfh
goblet
pours
the
color
of
cola
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipates
into
a
cluster
of
bubbles
forming
a
thin
band
around
the
perimeter
of
the
bowl
nose
reveals
cocoa
and
dark
fruit
very
similar
to
a
baltic
porter
in
character
with
a
slightly
acidic
quality
in
the
mix
taste
follows
nose
with
a
slightly
earthy
quality
some
licorice
and
a
sour
mash
character
that
reveals
itself
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
carbonation
that
is
slightly
higher
than
optimal
this
is
a
delicious
and
drinkable
brew
perhaps
not
quite
style
consistent
and
closer
to
a
baltic
porter
than
a
doppelbock
but
incredibly
tasty
nonetheless
close
to
three
fingers
of
dark
tan
head
a
lot
of
larger
bubbles
interspersed
throughout
pops
and
sizzles
down
to
the
surface
at
a
steady
gait
the
lacing
slides
down
the
glass
side
in
solid
sheets
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
mild
orange
tint
no
murkiness
at
all
just
darkness
a
pleasing
package
visually
theres
enough
roast
to
the
nose
to
evoke
coffee
dark
bakers
chocolate
and
a
pinch
of
chicory
softened
by
butterscotch
rum
raisin
and
date
to
fig
fruit
notes
very
light
banana
too
the
hops
more
like
straw
or
hay
than
anything
fresh
and
green
muscular
tenacity
in
your
nostrils
fullbodied
dry
and
crisp
mouth
entry
the
carbonation
welldefined
and
brisk
sip
by
sip
you
get
more
chocolate
butterscotch
nougat
molasses
and
coffee
hard
candy
the
raisin
fig
date
maraschino
cherry
flavors
not
overly
sweet
and
strongest
past
the
midpalate
more
of
foresty
mossy
sort
of
herbaceousness
here
wetter
and
livelier
minimal
citrus
or
spice
sticks
to
the
core
message
richness
without
heaviness
the
odd
animal
mixture
pours
a
very
deep
mahogany
which
can
only
be
seen
in
true
form
when
penetrated
by
a
very
close
source
of
light
atop
is
a
nice
tan
head
that
is
quick
to
relinquish
its
grip
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
the
smells
bring
many
thoughts
to
mind
most
of
them
tasty
the
main
aromas
are
a
molasses
and
booze
but
there
is
also
a
nice
paring
of
pineapple
and
caramel
as
well
to
make
it
very
interesting
the
taste
is
clearly
of
the
sweet
molasses
but
thats
not
all
there
are
hints
lemon
zest
plum
and
smoked
malts
with
a
prominent
spiced
rum
kicker
in
the
back
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
decent
while
the
beer
is
perfect
in
its
consistency
and
carbonation
the
booze
content
is
a
bit
on
the
acidic
side
to
where
it
attacks
the
sides
of
the
tongue
this
is
definitely
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
and
a
pretty
good
doppelbock
one
i
would
definitely
recommend
d
wow
this
was
great
ill
be
going
back
for
a
six
pack
of
this
the
flavor
is
subtly
aggressive
coating
the
palate
with
dark
fruit
notes
of
raisin
and
fig
powdered
chocolate
and
toasted
amber
malts
follow
suit
with
a
largerthanexpected
burst
of
resinous
hops
sticky
chewy
body
but
the
mouthfeel
never
becomes
a
chore
as
the
carbonation
level
is
spoton
all
in
all
a
wellcrafted
doppelbock
from
the
geniuses
that
dwell
in
farmville
nc
a
musttry
for
fans
of
the
style
drinkability
it
would
be
better
if
the
sweetness
was
toned
down
some
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
even
though
it
doesnt
approach
a
couple
of
german
doppelbocks
like
celebrator
its
a
nice
beer
and
competes
at
the
top
with
american
doppelbocks
flavor
is
good
not
the
best
dopplebock
out
but
very
solid
loads
of
dark
toasted
notes
more
tobacco
chocolatecaramel
sweetness
medium
body
medium
carbonation
and
medium
booze
warmth
a
little
hoppy
for
a
db
then
again
its
super
fresh
and
that
may
fade
would
be
interested
to
see
how
this
one
ages
tasty
beer
like
most
duck
rabbit
beers
d
duckrabbitor
huh
a
stretch
names
and
odd
label
imagery
aside
a
freakin
stellar
beer
the
maltmasters
at
dr
dun
dun
it
agin
a
gorgeous
highly
flavorful
wonder
that
im
lovin
every
bit
as
much
as
its
germanic
brethren
goes
down
pretty
easy
for
8
5
d
really
nice
take
on
the
style
great
beer
overall
tried
a
bottle
of
this
one
at
rfd
in
washington
dc
its
initial
pour
emits
a
razorthin
head
crowning
a
body
of
dark
brown
there
is
no
lacing
the
nose
detects
a
faint
hint
of
raisin
tinted
with
molasses
the
palate
gets
hit
with
an
obvious
blanket
of
cocoa
powder
it
does
not
overwhelm
and
finishes
quickly
with
a
well
balanced
mouthfeel
nice
mix
of
hop
and
malt
with
the
malt
having
the
smoother
edge
the
body
is
somewhat
heavy
albeit
one
with
intense
carbonation
and
the
obvious
alcohol
content
that
is
common
with
the
style
certainly
not
the
best
of
the
style
and
not
the
best
from
this
fine
brewer
still
not
a
bad
one
d
a
deep
enjoyable
afterdinner
brew
or
one
for
the
cooler
days
of
fall
approaching
the
8
5
abv
is
not
really
present
in
the
flavor
but
a
bit
in
the
feel
it
also
packs
a
boozy
punch
and
has
that
effect
on
the
imbiber
beware
the
drinkable
rabbitor
drinkability
is
high
because
its
tasty
balanced
and
refreshing
in
body
while
being
rich
and
filling
the
alcohol
isnt
detectable
in
the
taste
but
it
is
in
the
feel
d
interesting
and
easy
to
drink
d
i
was
kinda
shocked
at
how
easily
i
polished
off
this
beer
considering
the
alcohol
content
it
drinks
very
smooth
and
i
will
be
eagerly
seeking
it
out
again
excellent
dark
the
light
reveals
mahogany
to
garnet
hues
topped
by
a
modest
khaki
foam
about
1
finger
at
first
then
sticks
around
as
a
thin
sudsy
sheet
molassas
dark
fruits
and
some
complex
chocolate
malt
aromas
nutty
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
malt
roastiness
that
adds
a
little
to
the
bitterness
and
also
contributes
some
cocoa
powder
flavor
a
hint
of
plum
tries
to
dig
through
the
roast
finding
its
way
through
from
time
to
time
moreso
in
the
aroma
a
tad
minerally
but
just
barely
adding
some
sharpness
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
strong
brown
ale
there
is
an
overall
complexity
to
it
that
is
hard
for
me
to
describe
alcohol
is
detectable
but
fairly
well
hidden
until
it
smacks
you
upside
the
head
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
except
for
the
sharpness
assertive
and
solid
improves
as
it
warms
the
roastiness
starts
to
give
a
little
way
to
the
dark
fruits
and
hints
of
cherry
a
tad
roasty
to
be
truly
traditional
but
still
a
nice
beer
from
the
dark
beer
specialists
if
this
wasnt
labeled
a
doppelbock
i
would
probably
give
it
a
bump
for
taste
i
agree
with
my
predecessor
rabbit
it
pours
a
translucent
dark
rubybrown
topped
by
nearly
a
finger
of
dark
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
biscuits
caramel
toffee
light
roasted
malts
brown
sugar
and
a
pinch
o
nutmeg
the
taste
shows
us
that
those
biscuits
were
left
in
the
oven
a
tad
too
long
blackening
their
bottoms
the
caramel
is
similarly
burnt
everything
else
is
normal
but
muted
somewhat
in
the
face
of
the
charcoalladen
bits
that
may
sound
entirely
negative
but
it
really
isnt
just
different
and
kinda
unexpected
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
rather
smooth
feel
overall
a
different
doppel
than
im
used
to
but
tasty
nonetheless
get
some
had
to
take
it
slow
as
this
drinks
so
easily
definitely
a
huge
flavor
not
much
subtlety
here
and
i
imagine
age
could
change
the
shape
of
this
beer
in
various
interesting
ways
but
i
dont
think
the
remaining
bottles
are
gonna
make
it
for
very
long
around
here
bottom
line
this
is
a
very
solid
us
doppelbock
that
is
easy
to
put
back
highly
recommended
if
you
like
the
style
this
is
better
than
most
i
will
certainly
buy
it
again
all
hail
the
duckrabbator
this
beer
is
very
much
in
the
vein
of
the
traditional
german
dopplebocks
and
is
so
rich
that
i
would
not
have
been
surprised
if
it
were
an
eisbock
this
might
well
become
my
favorite
duck
rabbit
beer
d
this
is
a
very
good
dopplebock
duckrabbit
scores
again
overall
one
of
the
best
things
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
i
would
love
to
have
this
on
every
day
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
retains
reasonably
well
the
aroma
has
a
big
molasses
and
caramel
sweetness
upfront
along
with
some
licorice
honey
wheat
bread
cherries
plum
date
and
a
little
cognac
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
broad
sweetness
initially
notes
of
caramel
toffee
and
molasses
along
with
some
dark
fruits
fig
date
plum
cherry
toasted
wheat
bread
licorice
anise
cognac
and
some
flinty
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
rich
and
drinkability
is
excellent
an
exceptional
dopplebock
from
dr
its
complex
and
delicious
easily
the
best
american
iteration
highly
recommended
12oz
bottle
into
a
dfh
signature
glass
pours
a
deep
notquite
opaque
brown
with
a
decent
light
tan
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
aroma
is
toasted
dark
malts
and
burnt
caramel
the
taste
is
a
very
enjoyable
amount
of
toasted
malts
with
mild
accents
of
dried
fruits
and
molasses
the
taste
blows
the
aroma
out
of
the
water
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
but
it
is
quite
smooth
and
easy
drinking
i
enjoyed
this
one
ontap
last
summer
and
im
glad
its
getting
a
yearly
release
now
poured
a
clear
tea
colored
brown
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
disappeared
aromas
were
very
sweet
and
molasseslike
very
flavorful
with
strong
toffee
and
brown
sugar
elements
initially
dominating
before
a
nice
roastiness
emergees
to
balance
them
out
it
was
sweet
and
phenolic
enough
to
be
dessert
d
good
and
quite
unique
but
the
tobacco
just
a
bit
overwhelming
for
me
as
it
pretty
much
takes
over
the
entire
second
half
of
the
drink
maybe
not
quite
up
to
the
german
versions
but
still
very
tasty
and
another
very
good
one
from
duck
rabbit
they
should
think
about
bottling
this
at
some
point
dso
smooth
and
rich
it
is
almost
sinful
an
excellant
creation
by
paul
and
the
dr
crew
hopefully
this
one
isnt
a
one
off
d
duckrabbitor
drinks
like
a
champ
for
an
8
5
dopplebock
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
perhaps
enough
to
crown
it
as
my
favorite
duckrabbit
release
thus
far
this
one
definitely
exceeded
my
expectations
d
average
for
the
style
not
incredibly
drinkable
10
oz
pour
at
foundation
raleigh
nc
d
pretty
good
for
the
style
alcohol
taste
doesnt
hold
you
back
but
ive
never
felt
like
dopplebocks
are
the
kind
of
beer
for
sessioning
anyways
d
fantastic
maybe
a
little
extra
roasted
malt
flavor
than
your
typical
authentic
doppelbock
but
whose
complaining
the
abvs
are
higher
but
hidden
drinkability
this
is
a
slow
sipping
beer
that
will
last
a
while
cant
see
having
more
than
two
pints
in
a
session
but
this
will
last
you
a
while
this
is
one
hefty
doppelbock
herepoured
a
deep
dark
amberbrown
with
a
thinner
off
white
head
atop
big
caramel
and
dark
fruit
in
the
nose
with
a
tad
bit
of
sweet
doughflavors
have
a
big
sweet
dough
base
mixed
with
alcohol
dipped
dark
fruitthe
big
malt
tones
are
the
main
component
of
the
beerits
bigger
than
most
i
have
had
of
the
style
it
has
big
flavor
and
complexity
but
its
rich
and
a
a
bit
heavy
even
for
the
style
drinkability
a
really
fine
stab
at
the
style
a
bit
pepperier
than
the
germans
make
it
but
that
is
actually
a
nice
touch
the
mouth
was
a
little
disappointing
fairly
wet
and
slick
expected
a
bit
more
carbonation
on
the
tongue
but
it
was
not
there
pretty
weak
and
thin
flavor
was
of
big
chocolate
and
pumpernickel
bread
huge
mealy
taste
very
heavy
and
fulfilling
beer
here
finishes
slightly
bittersweet
like
coffee
hints
of
minerals
in
there
as
well
which
in
my
experience
is
a
common
thread
for
all
dr
beers
this
is
really
good
i
wish
they
would
bottle
this
the
drink
is
fullbodied
smooth
syrupyrich
and
creamy
in
feel
carbonation
is
mild
and
the
brew
silkysweet
and
highly
sippable
hella
potent
to
the
point
i
doubt
the
abv
is
only

a
damnedexcellent
firstlager
offering
from
the
dark
beer
specialists
in
farmville
duck
rabbit
you
have
out
done
yourselves
with
this
one
another
treat
from
the
brick
store
12th
anniversary
a
10
oz
pour
into
the
very
nice
duck
rabbit
multihead
snifter
pours
a
medium
to
dark
brown
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
not
too
thick
as
some
light
makes
its
way
through
a
nice
aroma
from
the
dark
malt
provides
a
mixture
of
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
far
stronger
in
these
characteristics
as
it
a
delicious
mixture
of
chocolate
coffee
and
raisons
there
is
a
bitter
tip
to
it
at
the
end
maybe
a
slightly
more
pronounced
hop
presence
not
as
thick
as
a
lot
of
duck
rabbits
offerings
it
is
much
more
medium
bodied
while
thin
there
is
no
overabundance
of
carbonation
so
it
is
still
a
smooth
sipper
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
further
proof
of
duck
rabbits
strong
presence
in
the
dark
beer
world
had
this
ontap
at
the
brick
store
pub
during
their
12th
anniversary
celebration
10
oz
poured
into
a
duckrabbit
branded
snifter
very
nice
beer
and
a
great
first
attempt
at
a
lager
by
this
brewery
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
bit
of
transluscence
and
a
relatively
thin
swirly
head
smells
malty
but
a
bit
thin
slightly
sweet
in
the
nose
with
some
raisins
and
molasses
but
not
at
all
syrup
like
a
good
deal
dryer
than
that
the
taste
is
very
nice
rich
and
very
very
smooth
with
restrained
sweetness
but
a
firm
maltiness
some
notes
of
chocolate
molasses
lots
of
caramel
some
raisins
and
plums
and
maybe
even
a
tad
of
coffee
bitterness
a
touch
of
lager
yeast
tang
throughout
but
this
is
very
subtle
silky
not
sticky
in
the
mouth
i
love
how
smooth
and
wonderful
this
is
in
the
mouth
silken
and
so
nice
slightly
sweet
but
there
is
a
bit
of
burnt
caramel
and
a
tiny
core
of
bitterness
that
helps
balance
everything
a
lovely
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
some
